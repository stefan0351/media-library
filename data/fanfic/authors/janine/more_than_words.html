<P>They were sitting in class, Buffy had just borrowed-all
right stolen-a pen from Willow's back pack and was turning to pay attention to
professor Walsh who was in the middle of a sentence. </P>
<P>"…it's about inspiration. Not the idea but the moment before
the idea when it's total, when it blossoms in your mind and connects to
everything. It's about the thoughts and experiences that we don't have a word
for," Walsh was saying as Buffy clued in. "A demonstration," she said as she
looked around the room. </P>
<P>"Buffy…Summers, come on down to the front here," Walsh said
smiling in a manner that wasn't completely reassuring. </P>
<P>Buffy glanced over at Willow as if there was something the
hacker could do about it. Willow gave her a look that said 'you're on your own
sister'. Buffy slowly rose to her feet and walked down the flat area of the
classroom where professor Walsh was standing. </P>
<P>"A normal girl," Walsh said indicating Buffy. "…one assumes.
Lay down on my desk," she continued. Buffy looked up at her questioningly.
</P>
<P>"What?" Buffy asked uncertainly. </P>
<P>"Go ahead you're perfectly safe," Walsh responded to the
look. </P>
<P>Buffy gave her one last look of uncertainty then walked the
few steps over to the desk hoping onto it, then carefully lifting her legs up
onto it and laying down. Once Buffy was settled Walsh looked around the room
once more her eyes settling on Willow. </P>
<P>"Ms. Rosenberg, would you be so kind as to oblige," Walsh
said after a moment. Buffy turned her head to the side watching Willow's
uncertain approach. Walsh crooked a finger calling Willow over to the side where
she was standing. Once Willow reached her, Walsh leaned over and whispered
something into her ear. </P>
<P>Buffy scrunched her face up in confusion. She didn't
understand what was going on. Did she seriously miss that much when she was
digging around Willow's bag? </P>
<P>Before she had much time to give the situation much more
thought Willow walked away from Walsh and approached her. The hacker walked
slower as she approached the desk until finally she stopped and leaned over the
desk and Buffy along with it. She placed her hand on the other side of Buffy's
body and just stared down at her for a moment. </P>
<P>"This feels very strange," Buffy said shifting her gaze
between Willow and the class. She was enjoying the closeness, she just felt odd
enjoying it in front of the class. </P>
<P>"Don't worry," Willow said with a gentle smile. "Everything
will be fine," she continued. </P>
<P>With that she bent further over the desk until she and Buffy
were nose to nose. Then she closed what little distance was left between them
and brought their lips together. The first touch was brief, their lips barely
brushing each other, but it soon deepened. </P>
<P>"Will," Buffy said softly when the hacker pulled away.
</P>
<P>"Kiss me and I'll make the sun go down," Willow said leaning
back down to capture the Slayers lips. </P>
<P>This time there was no hesitation and Buffy leaned up to
meet Willow's lips. Bringing her hand up to the back of Willow's neck Buffy drew
them closer together deepening the kiss. Professor Walsh, the entire class, they
all faded away leaving them alone in the darkened classroom, aware of no one or
anything but the feel of each other and the sensations coursing between them.
The feel of Willow's lips against hers, the warmth of her body, the feel of it
pressing against hers. Buffy was in heaven, they both were. Heaven on earth.
</P>
<P>"See," Willow said inching back and letting Buffy up.
</P>
<P>"Fortune favors the brave," Buffy said a smile working it's
way across her face. </P>
<P>She was about to say more, but then she heard a flute
playing softly in the distance. It was a sad song and she looked towards the
door. </P>
<P>"Do you hear that?" Buffy asked walking out into the
hallway. </P>
<P>There was singing. "Can't even shout, can't even cry, the
gentlemen are coming tonight. Looking in windows, knocking on doors, they need
to take seven and they might take yours." The singing was coming from a small
girl with long blond hair who was standing at the end of the hallway with a
small wooden box in her arms. "Can't call to mom, can't say a word, you're gonna
die screaming but you won't be heard," she continued. </P>
<P>Buffy stared at her as she sang, trying to figure out what
the lyrics to the song meant. Soon after the girl stopped singing she felt a
hand on her shoulder. It was Willow, she was standing behind her. </P>
<P>She turned around to see if perhaps the hacker could shed
any light on what was happening, but when she turned it wasn't Willow's face she
saw, but the that of a skeleton like man. </P>
<P>Buffy sat up suddenly, eyes blinking rapidly as she tried to
get her breathing under control. It felt like the rays of light were shining
directly into her retina's. Her back was too the window so she knew this to be
an impossibility, but that was still what it felt like. Rubbing her eyes she
threw her legs over the edge of the bed and hoped down. </P>
<P>She shook her head. That dream had been pretty intense.
After casting a brief glance at Willow, she grabbed her bathroom kit and headed
out the door, all the while wondering if the dream had some sort of important
meaning. If it was…what had Giles called it? Prophetic. She was wondering if the
dream was prophetic. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Once in the bathroom Buffy glanced into the mirror briefly
before starting to brush her teeth. Before the dream had gotten all weird she
had been enjoying it immensely. If it was prophetic she wondered if the first
part would come true too. She knew that if she had choose between which half to
go with, it would definitely be part A. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow was just waking up as Buffy re-entered their room.
She still had that sleep haze about her like she wasn't quite awake, and she was
rubbing her eyes. Buffy knew with absolute certainty that she had never seen a
more beautiful sight in all her years of life. Buffy smiled as Willow tossed her
blanket off of her revealing her pink cow pajamas. Buffy had been with her the
day she had bought those. She thought they were cute then, and she still did
now. She also knew that the only person who could wear them and still look sexy
was the red-headed hacker lying five-feet in front of her. </P>
<P>"Good morning," Buffy said smiling. </P>
<P>"Hey," Willow said throwing her legs off the side of the
bed. </P>
<P>They both paused. That wasn't quite right, no sound had come
out. Buffy rubbed her throat and tried again. </P>
<P>"Good morning," she said again. Still nothing. She frowned.
"Do you…can you…" she was getting increasing nervous. No sound was coming out of
her mouth. </P>
<P>Willow stood up. She quite clearly was alarmed. </P>
<P>"Willow, can you hear me?" Buffy asked. There was still no
sound. </P>
<P>"No," Willow answered shaking her head. "I've gone deaf,"
she continued bringing her hand up to her ears. </P>
<P>"No, I don't think so," Buffy said quickly walking over to
her friend. "We can't speak," she continued to mouth while her hands flailed
about. She was now officially in a highly agitated state. </P>
<P>"Ahhhh," Willow mouthed trying to scream. </P>
<P>"Ahhhh," Buffy mouthed copying Willow. </P>
<P>Still nothing. Buffy paused for a moment touching Willow's
arm before heading for the door. Opening it up she looked out in to the hallway.
All the way down there were people trying to talk, scream, anything, and all the
way down they were failing. </P>
<P>Buffy turned around when she felt Willow approaching her.
Willow looked at her questioningly. </P>
<P>"The same," Buffy mouthed to her. Willow's face became
clouded with concern. Buffy immediately reached out taking Willow's hand in
hers. She wanted to bring it up to her lips and kiss away her friends concern,
what she did was simply squeeze her hand reassuringly. </P>
<P>"It'll be alright," Buffy mouthed to her. "I
promise."</P>

<P>Willow was standing in the front of the mirror watching
herself not scream when the phone began to ring. Buffy came out of the closet
(insert your own joke) and headed towards the phone. </P>
<P>"Hel…" she started to say before remembering she couldn't
speak. She waited a few more seconds then put the receiver back down on the
cradle. </P>
<P>"Who was it?" Willow asked walking over. </P>
<P>Buffy shrugged. </P>
<P>"Oh, right," Willow mouthed shifting her gaze to the ground.
</P>
<P>"Willo…" Buffy started to say. Instead she stopped since
Willow couldn't hear her, and reached out her hand placing it on Willow's
shoulder. Willow looked up. </P>
<P>"We have to get dressed," Buffy said stoking her thumb along
the line of Willow's shoulder. </P>
<P>Willow nodded. It was going to be a long day.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>The rumors and trial and tribulations of the past few days
were the last thing on Willow's mind as she and Buffy walked through the streets
of Sunnydale hand in hand. Shortly after getting dressed they'd stopped trying
to mouth sentences to each other. The more they tried to talk the harder it
seemed to become to decipher what was being said. The silence however had left
them feeling terribly lonely. Buffy had walked over to Willow moments before
they left the room and hugged her. Since then they had remained in constant
physical contact with each other. </P>
<P>With no words between them to distract or confuse, they were
left with only feeling. The contact between them, and the feelings brought about
by being so close together were the only things keeping them sane. All around
them there was chaos, but together they were able to find some serenity.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>When the door to Giles's house opened Xander jumped up off
of the couch rushing out from behind it to meet them. He ended up stopping
short, however, when he saw them holding hands. They obviously didn't need any
comfort from him, so took to standing just behind the couch. </P>
<P>Soon after they entered the house Buffy released Willows
hand and headed over to where Giles was standing. </P>
<P>"Hey," she mouthed to him. He nodded and gave her a sad
smile. Glancing behind him Buffy saw Xander and smiled at him giving a little
wave. He gave a little wave back then returned to standing still. </P>
<P>Willow suddenly got excited and took the marker board that
they had bought on the way over and started writing on it. Smiling she held it
up a moment later. It read: Hi Giles. The watcher smiled and walked over to her
drawing Willow into a hug. Buffy didn't really want to interrupt but she had to
tell Giles about her dream. Walking over to them she tapped Giles on the arm.
</P>
<P>"I've got to talk," she stopped. "Tell you something," she
continued a mouth correcting herself. None of them were going to be TALKING
about anything for a while. "It's important," she continued. Willow nodded along
with Buffy. The Slayer had told her about the dream before they left the dorm,
writing down the story-minus the make-out part-on a pad of paper. </P>
<P>Giles nodded and motioned her into the kitchen. Buffy cast
one last look at Willow, one she hoped was reassuring then followed Giles into
the kitchen. Willow then headed into the main part of the room where Xander,
Anya, Spike and a woman Willow assumed to Olivia-Giles' 'friend'-were sitting.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy glanced at the window again. It was almost dusk, she
was going to have to go soon. Willow was sitting beside her on the couch but she
had fallen asleep about half an hour earlier. The hackers head was now lying on
Buffy's shoulder and there was no space between their bodies whatsoever. Spike
had glared at her a couple of times but she ignored him. Having Willow that
close to her made it all go away, at least for a time. But that time was running
out. Buffy reached around with the arm that wasn't being smooshed against her
side by Willow's body and touched he hacker's shoulder. </P>
<P>"Willo…" she started to say before remembering. They'd all
been doing that all day. Forgetting that they couldn't talk. Then when it
finally hit them it was like being slapped across the face. Closing her mouth
Buffy switched tactics and began to shake Willow lightly. She really didn't want
to wake her friend up, but she what she wanted didn't matter. She had a town to
protect. </P>
<P>Willow moaned a little-Buffy could feel the vibrations in
her chest even though no sound came out-and snuggled closer to the Slayer. Buffy
closed her eyes. If it wasn't for the fact that the entire town had been caught
in the grip of a mysterious disease she'd think that she had found had found her
own private utopia. Opening her eyes she tugged at Willow again. This time the
hacker woke up and lifted her head from Buffy's shoulder. Buffy smiled at her.
</P>
<P>"Just tell me I wasn't snoring," Willow mouthed to her.
</P>
<P>"No snoring, minimal drool," Buffy mouthed back. Willow
smiled but remained where she was. "I've gotta get up," Buffy mouthed to her
apologetically a moment later. Willow looked at her confused, then her eyes
widened and she blushed while backing away from Buffy. </P>
<P>Buffy regarded the red-head for a moment. She wanted to
reach out and take Willow into her arms and kiss away all her concerns. Usually
when the situations they found themselves in got heavy she would be able to
comfort Willow with words, by getting her to concentrate on the sound of her
voice instead of what was bothering her. Now, that had been taken away leaving
the urge to comfort her physically even stronger. </P>
<P>With an inaudible sigh Buffy stood up and headed into
Giles's bathroom to get ready for patrol.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow shifted into the spot where Buffy had been sitting
after the Slayer got up. It was warm and toasty, and Buffy's perfume lingered in
the air. Glancing to the side she caught Anya staring at her. Willow raised her
eyebrow slightly asking 'what?' silently. Anya pointed at her, then she turned
and looked in the direction Buffy had gone, indicating the Slayer. Then she
raised her hands into the air making an "O" shape with one hand. With the other
hand she extended two fingers and inserted them into the "O" shape pumping them
in and out a couple of times. Once she was finished she looked up a Willow with
a questioning look on her face. </P>
<P>Willow looked around to see if anyone else had caught the
gesture. They seemed oblivious and Willow clamed down a bit. Turning her
attention back to Anya she scowled at her. </P>
<P>"What?" Anya mouthed. They were always getting mad at her.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow stayed in the main room for a few moments longer then
got up and went to look for Buffy. She had this sinking feeling in the bottom of
her stomach. She didn't want Buffy to go out there. She found Buffy in Giles's
bathroom leaning over the counter looking into the mirror. Spotting her Buffy
looked up. </P>
<P>"Hey," the Slayer mouthed. Willow gave her a little nod and
walked into the room. "What's the up?" Buffy mouthed noticing the concerned look
on Willow's face. </P>
<P>"Do you have to go?" Willow asked closing the distance
between them. Buffy reached out closing the distance between them and pulled
Willow into a hug. After a few second Buffy then pulled back so that Willow
could see her face. </P>
<P>"You know I do," Buffy mouthed with a regretful look on her
face. Willow didn't make any kind of response. Buffy could tell that she was not
at all happy with that reply. Willow didn't want her to go, that was as clear as
the day was long. What was also clear was that it didn't make a difference what
either of them wanted, she HAD to go, just like she HAD to do a lot of other
things. </P>
<P>Buffy closed the distance between them and leaned forward so
that their foreheads were resting against each other. She brought her hand up to
Willow's cheek and stroked it lightly with her thumb. She knew that whatever she
did to comfort Willow would have to be more than words. So, when she leaned in
even more her intentions were completely pure. The act that she was about to
perform was out of friendship and the need to help, and those only. She brought
their lips together barely brushing Willows with her own in what was suppose to
be friendly kiss. However, as soon as their lips touched Buffy felt a spark shot
thorough her entire body leaving a tingling warmth in it's wake. </P>
<P>Willow's eyes had closed automatically at the first touch of
Buffy's lips against her won. It was like a jolt of electricity had been sent
through her body. The contact only lasted a few seconds but to Willow it felt
like a lifetime. When she opened her eyes she saw Buffy looking at her with an
expression that matched what she was feeling exactly. It was scared, excited,
relived, uncertain, and loving. </P>
<P>They stood there staring at each other for a few more
moments, regarding each other. </P>
<P>Then, Willow closed the gap between them and crushed her
lips against Buffy's. Buffy brought her hand up to the back of Willow's neck
steadying her as their kiss deepened. For long moments they kissed passionately,
hungrily, hands tangling in hair as they tried to fuse their bodies together
whilst their tongues dueled. They could both taste the saltiness of tears
running into their kisses but neither of them was sure who was responsible.
</P>
<P>When the need for oxygen finally forced them to part they
remained close, clinging to each other as their breathing calmed. They stayed
like for endless moments until Buffy heard Giles ringing his 'come hither' bell.
</P>
<P>Willow looked at her when they separated, silently pleading.
Buffy felt a tear roll down her face, she couldn't stay, she had to go. Closing
the distance between them once again she gave Willow a soft, sweet kiss, gently
stroking her hair. She ran her hand down Willow's arm until Willow's hand was in
hers and she held in tightly for a moment before slowly starting to back away
until the contact between them broke and she walked out of the room.</P>

<P>Willow paced the hallways of the school anxiously looking at
the door. Xander and Anya were already in the auditorium but she had opted to
wait for Giles and Buffy by pacing the halls nervously. The past couple of hours
had been torture for her. Not only could they still not speak, but she had to
suffer in silence while being haunted by the memories of the kisses she and
Buffy had shared. It had been both unexpected and overdue when it finally
happened, and all Willow wanted was to be back in Buffy's arms and to stay there
for eternity. So, she paced the hallways awaiting the Slayer's return.
</P>
<P>Just as she was about check her watch for what had to have
been the hundredth time the door flung open and Giles and Buffy came walking in.
Buffy's eyes went straight to Willow and they both broke out in huge grins.
Buffy tapped Giles on the shoulder and mouthed something to him. The Watcher
nodded and headed into the auditorium. Buffy remained where she was until Giles
disappeared into the other room, then she walked over to Willow nervously
shifting her gaze from the hacker to the floor and back. </P>
<P>Once Buffy reached Willow she extended her hand and grasped
Willows. They both stood there shifting their gazes between their joined hands
and their eyes. Both feeling so much and not knowing how to describe it, or
explain it. They no longer had anything to hide behind. Finally, Willow raised
her free hand up to Buffy's cheek and drew them together, capturing the Slayers
lips with her own. </P>
<P>The world faded away from them as they themselves in each
other embrace. Tongues tangling, bodies pressed against each other, hands
roaming, this explored each other. The world around them was forgotten, all that
existed was the sweetness of their lips, of their kiss. </P>
<P>Finally, Willow pulled back allowing her and Buffy to take
in some much needed oxygen. Once they had gotten their breathing under control
Willow looked at the doors to the auditorium as if to saw 'we should probably go
in there'. Buffy responded with a look that said 'nah', and began to lean in the
capture Willow's lips once more when the doors opened. </P>
<P>Giles stood in the door way with his hands on his hips
glaring at them. He was not pleased. It was time for them to take their seats.
Class was about to begin.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy
shook her head as Giles started the music that was to accompany his
presentation. Sometimes the man was such a drama queen. </P>
<P>"Who are the Gentlemen?" The first overhead read. Looking at
the scribbled writing Buffy could tell that Giles had spent about as much time
preparing this as she usually did studying. Which was to say no time at all.
</P>
<P>"Fairy Tale Monsters, come to town to steal the voices of
the townspeople" the next overhead read. This one had nice little drawings.
</P>
<P>The next two overheads showed an unknown person brutally
getting butchered by the Gentlemen while they slept. There were legs thrashing,
and arms flailing and Buffy had to wonder at the detail Giles put into these two
particular overheads. </P>
<P>The next overhead showed the one of the Gentlemen holding up
seven hearts. </P>
<P>After that overhead Xander drew their attention over to him
and wrote something down on his board. Holding it up they were able to read it.
It said: How do we kill them? </P>
<P>Buffy thought for a moment then got an idea. Bringing their
attention over to her she placed her hand over her lap and started to make a
pumping motion, lifting her hand up and down. After a few moments she looked
around to see what they thought of her idea only to find them all looking at her
like she was insane. Buffy looked back at them with a confused expression, then
it dawned on her that the motion she was making stood for something completely
different to what she wanted to convey. Quickly she reached into her bag pulling
out a stake and repeated the motion with her wooden friend. Once she did this
they all started nodding in understanding. </P>
<P>Giles put up an overhead with a bunch of swords sticking
into one of the Gentlemen once Buffy was finished with her little demonstration.
The gist of the overhead seemed to be that not even a lot of swords sticking in
them would kill a Gentlemen. Once again Buffy had to wonder at the graphic
detail. Next Giles put up an overhead that revealed that only the sound of a
scream could kill the Gentlemen. That's why when they came to town they stole
everyone's voices…so that no one could scream. </P>
<P>Willow got excited after that and started to dig around in
her back pack. She obviously had an idea. Eventually she pulled out a C.D. and
held it up in the air. Then she started to twitch around in her chair bringing
her hand to neck making a choking motion. After that she stuck her tongue out
the side of her mouth and slumped down in the chair like she was dead. Then as
soon as it was over she sat up straight again and smiled. Buffy looked over at
her with an amused grin. God, she loved her! </P>
<P>Giles responded by putting up another overhead. Buffy was
beginning to wonder how many of those things he had. On this overhead there was
a person and it said that only a HUMAN voice could kill the Gentlemen.
Therefore, the C.D was out. Picking up her message board Buffy wrote down a
message on it and held it up. Her message read: How do I get my voice back?
</P>
<P>Giles didn't have an overhead for that. </P>
<P>They sat in silence for a moment, then Giles put up his last
overhead. It had a little drawing of Buffy with her Graduation umbrella, and it
instructed Buffy to go patrolling. Buffy stared at the drawing Giles had made of
her and frowned. Her hips were huge, what was he thinking? Looking at the
overhead she moved her hands to the side of her hips and made half circle
motions with her hands. The hips, the hips her actions were saying. My God, look
at those hips! </P>
<P>Willow smirked and the others just filed out the room.
Following them out Buffy glanced back at the overhead. What was he thinking?

<P>Willow paced around their dorm room. It seemed to be a
pattern with her lately. Pacing and waiting for Buffy. Truthfully she could do
without it, it was shooting her nerves to hell. She sighed and walked over to
Buffy's side of the room. Picking Mr. Gordo up off of the Buffy's desk, Willow
walked over to Buffy's bed and lay down on it. She really needed to be
surrounded by all things Buffy at the moment, at least until the real thing got
back. </P>
<P>At any other place, at any other time, her mind would have
been on the amazing power she was able to summon earlier on with Tara-from her
Wicca groups-help. It was more than just the fact that they were able to move
the vending machine, it was also the feelings that coursed through her when
their powers joined together. It was amazing, it made every nerve ending in her
body feel alive. They only time anything had ever made her feel like that was
when she and Buffy kissed. It had been a pretty eventful night for her. New
super cool Wicca power, and Buffy kissing. If it wasn't for the fact that people
all around town were getting their hearts cut out, she would have considered
this one of the best nights of her life. Well, the fact that people were getting
their hearts cut out, and that her ankle hurt like a bitch. On the bright side,
she had gotten her voice back which meant that Buffy had succeeded and that
meant that she wasn't dead.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy walked quickly towards her room. All she wanted to do
was get in there and make sure that Willow was okay. Well, that and take her
into her arms and never let her go. The night had gone as well as could be hoped
for except for the fact that Riley now knew her secret-well not really, but he
knew that she wasn't who she seemed to be, and that was enough of a cause for
concern. However, it went two ways and she now knew that he was part of the
militia group that was horning in on her territory, and had neutered Spike. This
would no doubt have repercussions later on, but Buffy didn't want to think about
Riley, or the militia, or most of all Spike. All she wanted to do was go home
and see Willow. </P>
<P>Opening the door, Buffy saw Willow lying on her bed holding
Mr. Gordo tightly to her chest. The hackers eyes were closed and she looked so
peaceful that Buffy almost thought that she was asleep. That brief thought was
banished from her mind, however, when Willow opened her eyes and sat up smiling.
</P>
<P>"Buffy," she said putting Mr. Gordo down on the bed and
moving to stand up. </P>
<P>Buffy smiled. </P>
<P>"It is so good to hear your voice," Buffy said reverently
walking over to her. </P>
<P>"Not as good as it is to hear yours," Willow countered
smiling. "Besides I've been hearing my voice for eighteen/nineteen years now.
It's kind of losing it's thrill," she continued walking into Buffy's open arms.
</P>
<P>"Not for me," Buffy said enveloping Willow into her embrace.
</P>
<P>"I'm glad you're not dead," Willow whispered into Buffy's
ear as they held each other. </P>
<P>Buffy laughed and drew Willow closer. </P>
<P>"So am I Will, so am I," she responded running her fingers
through Willow's hair. </P>
<P>A few moments later they drew away from each other backing
up so that they could see the others face. After a moment of this Buffy closed
the distance between them bringing their faces so close together that their
noses were touching but she stopped there and their lips hovered close to each
other almost touching but not quite. </P>
<P>Willow opened her mouth to say something, but whatever it
was never got said because Buffy finally moved the last few centimeters to
Willow's lips and snared her lips. Willow moaned into her mouth and deepened
their kiss as their hands started to roam each others bodies. </P>
<P>"Uh," Willow groaned as Buffy broke the contact between them
pulling back. </P>
<P>"Does that mean you liked it?" Buffy asked a playful smile
working it's way across her face. </P>
<P>"Uh, yeah," Willow responded reaching out for the Slayer.
Buffy shifted slightly avoiding her hand. "What are you doing?" Willow whined.
</P>
<P>"Would you like a little cheese to go along with that
whine?" Buffy asked still smiling. </P>
<P>"That's original," Willow responded. "I like you better when
you couldn't speak," Willow continued grumbling. </P>
<P>Buffy smiled and moved closer to Willow again taking her
hand in hers. </P>
<P>"Trust me, I would like nothing more that to continue with
what we were doing," Buffy whispered into Willow's air. "My body temp. is
somewhere up there with the Sahara desert, meaning way up there," Buffy
continued nuzzling Willow ear a bit. "But…" </P>
<P>"No buts," Willow said softly moving her body against
Buffy's. </P>
<P>"Willow," Buffy groaned deep in her throat. She was trying
to say something important. She exactly remember what it was just then, but is
was important she was sure of that. "No," Buffy said trying to move away a
little. </P>
<P>"Yes," Willow said not letting her move away. </P>
<P>"Yes?" Buffy asked. She liked that answer a whole lot
better. She hadn't pictured Willow as being this controlling, she liked it
though. In fact she was liking it a WHOLE lot at the moment. </P>
<P>"Yes," Willow confirmed. </P>
<P>"No," Buffy said managing to get some blood flowing back to
her brain. "We've got to talk." </P>
<P>Willow stopped what she was doing. </P>
<P>"I know," she responded pulling back so that Buff could see
her. "I just like doing this," she continued in that sexy grin of hers. Buffy's
resolve nearly dissolved at that sight. Sometimes she wondered if Willow had any
idea how truly, utterly, effortlessly sexy she was. </P>
<P>"I'm liking it a whole lot too," Buffy said trying to fight
back the urge to just go ahead and kiss her. </P>
<P>"Space...between us," Willow started. "Would probably be a
good idea," she continued fighting her own urges and only succeeding partially.
</P>
<P>"You know what the problem is?" Buffy asked running her hand
up Willow's side. </P>
<P>"What?" Willow asked her breath catching a bit. </P>
<P>"We waited way, way, way, way, way…did I mention way? …too
long to do this," Buffy said planting a soft kiss on Willow's lips. "Now, well,
now we just can't control ourselves." </P>
<P>"And control is good?" Willow asked. She was thinking that
at the moment lack of control was feeling very good. </P>
<P>"What?" Buffy asked kissing along Willow's jaw-line.
</P>
<P>"I don't know," Willow said turning her head to pull Buffy
into a kiss. </P>
<P>"Wait," Buffy said carefully disengaging herself from
Willow's mouth. "Talk, we're suppose to be talking," she said backing up and
putting some space between them. If she stayed that close to Willow's body
they'd never get to the talking. </P>
<P>Willow gave her a pouty look but didn't disagree.
</P>
<P>"Okay then," Buffy said. "It's settled, talking there shall
be," she continued. "Let's move over to the beds." </P>
<P>Willow smiled and started to follow her. </P>
<P>"Our OWN beds," Buffy said putting up a hand. </P>
<P>Willow complied. </P>
<P>"Okay," Buffy said drawing out the word. "Let the talking
begin," she continued slapping her hands together. "Now we shall talk…now…talk,"
she went on. </P>
<P>Willow simply stared at her. Buffy looked back. All of a
sudden she couldn't think of much to talk about. That fact that couldn't think
of anything to talk about was absolutely confounding since they obviously had a
lot to discuss. They were best friends, they were both girls, Buffy was a
Slayer. All of those factors had come into play keeping them apart, but now…no
talk. It was almost like they were beyond words. </P>
<P>They smiled at the same time. Standing up they met each
other half way between the beds and started to kiss each other passionately.
What they were feeling was more than words, and that's what they needed to
explain it. </P>
<P>"Willow?" Buffy asked in between kisses. </P>
<P>"Uh huh," Willow managed to get out before lowering her head
to Buffy neck. </P>
<P>"Do you want this?" Buffy asked. It was important that she
know. </P>
<P>"More than I've ever wanted anything in life," Willow
responded. </P>
<P>"Good," Buffy responded running her hands up Willow's sides
again. "Then take off your clothes." </P>
<P>"After you," Willow responded slipping her hand under
Buffy's shirt.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy carefully lead Willow over to her bed and lay her down
before joining her. Lying down next her Buffy brought her lips to Willow's
kissing her as their hands resumed searching each others bodies, seeking out and
removing clothing. </P>
<P>And then, before they knew it they were both completely
devoid of clothing, and their bodies lay together unobstructed, skin to skin.
Passionately, loving they explored each others bodies, learning and exciting.
Moving together and apart in a dance as old as time itself. No inch of their
bodies, no piece of their skin on either of their bodies was left uncharted,
untouched, unmoved. </P>
<P>That night, two souls, two bodies, two loves became one. And
it was good.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy lay on her side drawing shapes on Willow's stomach
with her finger as her friend, her lover, lay on her back with her eyes closed.
Buffy smiled and leaned over placing a kiss just a above Willow's belly-button.
She felt the surface beneath her ripple and knew that Willow was laughing
gently. </P>
<P>"That tickles," Willow said raising her hand and running it
through Buffy's hair. </P>
<P>"So I probably shouldn't do it again, huh?" Buffy asked
placing another kiss above the red-head's belly-button. </P>
<P>"You're…" Willow started. </P>
<P>"Incorrigible," Buffy asked. "I'm not exactly sure what that
means but people usually say it in situations like this." </P>
<P>"I was going to say 'bad', but incorrigible works too,"
Willow said moving Buffy's head away from her stomach. </P>
<P>Buffy obliged and moved up until she was above Willow
looking down at her. Smiling she leaned down and brought their lips together.
</P>
<P>"Hey, Will?" Buffy asked moving so that she was lying on her
side once again. </P>
<P>"What?" Willow asked lazily. </P>
<P>"If that 'kinda gay' comment was true, does that mean the
dominatrix thing is too?" Buffy asked watching Willow carefully to see her
reaction. </P>
<P>To her surprise Willow hardly reacted at all. She merely
turned her head so that she was looking directly at Buffy and smiled.
</P>
<P>"Who knows," Willow said. "I've long since ceased trying to
predict anything that might happen in my life." </P>
<P>Buffy looked at her for a moment then shook her head. She'd
leave that one alone for the moment. </P>
<P>"You know," Buffy said changing the subject. "It's funny…"
</P>
<P>"What is?" Willow asked playing the palm of Buffy's hand.
</P>
<P>"If I hadn't overheard Claire and some of her buddies
talking in the café, none of this," she said gesturing to their bodies, "might
have happened." </P>
<P>"Claire?" Willow asked surprised. </P>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy said shaking her head. "When I was waiting for
you, I overhead them talking about us. At the end the general consensus seemed
to be that we were, and I quote 'queer as black sunshine', and we were being
queer together," Buffy continued. "It made me start to think…which isn't always
a good thing with me…and I started to realize that maybe they weren't that far
off the mark, at least about my feelings," she finished shaking her head. "Just
goes to show you, life is like…" </P>
<P>"Don't…Buffy, don't," Willow said. She knew where this was
going. </P>
<P>"…a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get,"
Buffy continued smiling as Willow scrunched up her face. </P>
<P>"It's funny that you mention Claire," Willow said a moment
later. </P>
<P>"Why?" Buffy asked running her eyes up and down Willow's
body. She was ready to stop talking again real soon. </P>
<P>"She's the one that got me thinking about it too," Willow
said. "At least seriously," she added. </P>
<P>"Really?" Buffy asked looking up curiously. </P>
<P>"Yeah, that night that I met you down by the stadium I ran
into her-literally-and we walked together for a while. Then just before she
headed in her own direction, she said something about 'it' being great. And I
was all, what's 'it', you know? And she was like 'you and Buffy, there's so much
homophobia, you're so brave' blah, blah," Willow continued. "After that I
started thinking about it, well thinking about it intensely." </P>
<P>"Well, I for one say 'yeh for Claire!'," Buffy responded.
"But let's stop with the talking, and get with the…" Buffy stopped, she couldn't
think of a word. </P>
<P>Willow smiled and leaned over bringing her lips to Buffy's.
</P>
<P>"It's a good thing I'm the brains of this operation," Willow
mumbled before they both lost the ability to speak, but in the best possible
way.</P>

<P>Claire pushed away from the tree she was leaning against
when she saw the light go out in room 214. She smiled, she knew that they'd be
busy for quite some time. It had taken her long enough, they'd better well enjoy
the benefits of her hard work! It was alright though, she was happy to do it as
she and many, many others would benefit from the two of them coming together.
Not to mention the fact that they made a cute couple. </P>
<P>Heading down the pathway that lead off of campus Claire
smiled to herself again, and then disappeared into a cloud of smoke. </P>
<P>Now, things were about to get interesting.</P>
