<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 9 -->

<p>"So everything's alright?" Angel asked, his relief clear even through  the muffled tones of the receiver.  He'd been getting increasing  agitated as the days had worn on and he hadn't heard anything from  her.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, everything's fine.  She's completely alive … and, dare I say  it, finally on the mend," the brunette responded.  "How did the stuff  at the warehouse go?"</p>

<p>"You know, slash.  Kick.  People running away in a blind panic.   Consult the books.  Swords.  Methane tanks.  The usual," the vampire  responded trying to sound nonchalant.  The truth was, though it had  taken a couple of days, they hadn't had much trouble dispensing with  the small group of demons that had kidnapped the boy.  But, it just  hadn't been the same without Cordelia there.  He didn't know quite  how to explain it, but things just seemed off somehow with the  brunette gone, and the others had felt it too.  The fact was, that  he'd be glad when she came back.  "So, when can we expect the  pleasure of you're company?" </p>

<p>"Tomorrow morning I guess," the brunette responded.  It had been a  couple days since the musical incident ended, and while things with  Willow and Tara seemed a little tense, and the Scoobies interactions  with the Slayer were still rather strained, Buffy seemed to be taking  whatever epiphany she had at the Bronze that night to heart.  She  wouldn't have minded sticking around a little more to see how things  turned out, to maybe help Buffy ease back into life a bit more, but  she knew that if she didn't leave soon she was going to be sucked  into something bigger than whatever it was that had been going on  between her and Slayer, and she couldn't wait for that.  She had  responsibilities to get back to in L.A.  "Everything here is slowly  getting back to normal … so, no more Cordy."</p>

<p>"We'll all," the vampire started pausing, then sighing.  "I'll be  glad when you're back.  The hotel has been missing a certain …  Cordyosity."</p>

<p>"You mean horribly bad coffee?" the brunette asked. "Of course," Angel responded.  "We've been able to drink it for the  last week.  I don't think that Fred has been able to get to sleep for  the last three days."</p>

<p>"So," Dawn began looking at her sister dubiously.  "What you're  saying is that the Bretton Woods project was a task undertaken by the  world's leading thinkers in cracker technology to create a new and  better biscuit?" she went on. "And that this all became possible  because of amazing discoveries that Gen. Poncho Villa made during the  invasion of Normandy?"</p>

<p>Buffy shifted uncomfortably in her chair as her sister summed up the  conversation they had just had into a few very compact, very  incredulous sentences.  It had seemed a lot better when she was  making it up.</p>

<p>"Buffy did ever even GO to school?" Dawn asked shaking her head.  She  may not have read the homework, or paid much attention in class, but  she knew that Poncho Villa didn't have anything to do with the  invasion of Normandy, and was willing to bet her `No String's  Attached' cd that Bretton Woods didn't have anything to do with  crackers … even though Bretton crackers were very yummy with spread.</p>

<p>"I did," Buffy replied huffily looking over at Dawn.  "Occasionally I  did," she continued playing with the scone on the plate in front of  her.  "Once or twice," she went on glancing over at Dawn.</p>

<p>She held her sisters gaze for a moment, each of them staring at each  other intensely, before they both began making little hmph-ing sounds  in there throats which quickly led to full out laughing.</p>

<p>"I seriously fail to see how writing a history paper could be this  much fun," Cordelia stated walking into the kitchen eyeing the two  laughing Summers girls with a touch of amusement and concern.  What  could possibly be that funny?</p>

<p>"It is if Buffy's the one giving you source material," Dawn replied  cracking up again.  "Poncho Villa," she continued shaking her  head.  "Ass."</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy responded.  "He was very important to development of  commercially marketing the hooded sweater jacket!"</p>

<p>"Was this before or after he personally defeated Dr. No in his island  fortress of extremely stupid evil?" Dawn asked smirking at Buffy.   She'd missed this, them just sitting around snarking at each other in  the way only sisters can do and still love each other in the  morning.  She'd missed Buffy.</p>

<p>"Oh go to bed," Buffy replied pointing at the door.  Dawn stuck out  her tongue.  "No  seriously," Buffy continued.  "Go to bed.  It's past midnight." "I would so kill to get my hands on one of your old papers," the  brunette stated with a smile sitting down across from the Slayer.</p>

<p>"I hear they're actually handing them out to the kids now as  warnings, skip class and this could happen to you," Buffy responded  shaking her head with an exaggerated sigh.  "My personal favorite  was `Nuts to the Middle Ages'.  I based the whole essay on five  minutes of a documentary I saw on PBS one night.  It would've been  good, it could've been good…you know if the documentary had actually  been on the Middle Ages," she continued smirking at the  brunette.  "And if I had left out the little rant about genetically  engineered, super intelligent monkey's surviving us icies on the  moon."</p>

<p>"You're a strange girl, aren't you Buffy?" Cordelia asked the other  woman, her eyes twinkling with amusement.</p>

<p>"Professionally," the Slayer responded with a grin, before becoming  pensive as she regarded the brunette.  "When?" she asked finally her  eyes drifting about the kitchen.</p>

<p>"When what?" Cordelia responded, not surprised but still confused by  Buffy's abrupt subject change.</p>

<p>"When are you leaving?" the Slayer asked looking back over at the  former debutante.</p>

<p>"Oh," the brunette replied with sigh, slumping down in her chair  slightly.  "Tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I bet the business is crumbling without you," Buffy commented,  suddenly finding the tabletop very interesting.</p>

<p>"You have no idea.  I really wonder about those people.  The only  thing I don't have to schedule for them are bathes," Cordelia  responded in a fond tone though she shook her head as if it were an  absolutely exasperating experience just thinking about them.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment as she considered what had been said.   The truth was that she had become quite fond of the brunette and she  didn't at all want her to go.  In fact she would have been quite  pleased with Cordelia staying with them, with her indefinitely.  But  she knew that it couldn't be that way.  </p>

<p>"I should give you a proper send off," the blonde began moments  later, pushing out of her chair and standing up.</p>

<p>"What did you have in mind?" the brunette asked looking over at the  Slayer questioningly.</p>

<p>"Follow me and I'll show you," the Slayer responded, a truly  lecherous grin spreading across her features as her eyes raked  themselves over the brunette's body, before she turned and headed for  the door.</p>

<p>"Different cork than I was expecting," Cordelia mumbled to herself  standing up.  "But it works for me," she continued with a grin.  Oh,  sweet Sunnydale.</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia stood looking out of the Summers bay window.  The Scoobies  were congregated outside on the lawn with her luggage talking about  something or the other, probably wedding plans from the look on  Willow's face.  They'd been inside moments before saying their  goodbyes, but had left after the hugs and the `good to see yous' to  wait for Cordelia's cab.  As for the brunette herself, she was  waiting for a certain Slayer to make her appearance so that they  could say a proper goodbye to each other.  A private goodbye, worth  of the bond formed between them over the past week.</p>

<p> "I didn't say it the first time you left…you know, because I  wouldn't have meant it," Buffy started with an impish little grin as  she stepped off the last stair.  "But I'm going to miss you," she  continued coming to stop in front of the brunette who was now facing  her.  Her voice dropped intimately as she looked at the other woman  and she had to struggle to suppress the urge she was feeling to  stroke the brunette's cheek.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Cordelia responded looking down at the Slayer  thoughtfully.  "You're temporary sweetener," she continued a ghost a  smile making it's way across her face.  For some reason she was  feeling an intense desire to wrap the smaller woman in her arms and  squeezing her as tightly to her as she could without injuring either  of them.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy stated taking a step towards the other woman.  "No  Sweet ' n ' Low, just you," she continued softly.  "If things were  different," she went on dropping her head down not quite sure that  she should be voicing the thoughts that were running through her  head.  "I don't' know, if things were different I guess that things  could be different."</p>

<p>"You'd join the parade with Kim and Kerry over there," the brunette  asked flickering her head towards the window indicating Willow and  Tara who were waiting outside with the others and her luggage.   Truthfully, she never considered that she would consider considering  herself one of those women who wore shirts saying `I'm not gay, but  my girlfriend is'.  But she had never considered considering that she  might end up working for a vampire, while getting visions from a  higher power that helped her be a champion of justice, before  becoming a Queen in an alternate dimension.  So all things  considered, what she considered considering didn't really mean that  much.</p>

<p>"Well, I already march to my own drummer," the Slayer responded  grinning at the brunette.  She should have figured that the brunette  would've been able to figure out what she was getting at.</p>

<p>"And I step to my own tune," the ex-cheerleader responded seriously  before pausing for a second, then leaning down and brining their lips  together.  Drawing the blonde into her tenderly as her hands came to  rest of the Slayer's hips, deepening the kiss as they stayed locked  together in that sweet embrace for long moments.  </p>

<p>"I've gotta go," Cordelia whispered reluctantly, taking a step back  from the blonde in an attempt to collect herself.</p>

<p>"You will call, won't you?" Buffy asked as the brunette opened up the  front door.  "I may be reanimated tissue but I'm a still a lady," she  continued trying to make herself sound only half as demanding as she  was feeling.</p>

<p>"I…" Cordelia started to say turning around to face Buffy.  "I will,"  she continued softly smiling at the Slayer before turning back around  and heading down the steps.  The cab had just pulled into the  driveway, and she wouldn't look back.</p>
