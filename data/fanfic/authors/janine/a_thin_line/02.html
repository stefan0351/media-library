<p>Sam opened the door to Brooke's bedroom quietly, not that it really mattered
since the blonde had her headphones on and couldn't hear her anyway.  The
brunette leaned against the door frame and watched as her girlfriend swayed
those sexy hips to the beat of whatever song was being pumped into her ears.</p>

<p>"Loving you is not just luck or illusion/ It's in the make up of our DNA.
It's not by chance we make the perfect solution/ Don't fight it baby, you
know that it's just destiny's way/ Baby loving You/ Comes easily to me/
It's what I'm living for, it's all in the chemistry/ Baby loving you, is how
it's meant to be, it's something that is all so natural to me," Brooke sang
as she moved about her room oblivious to her observer.</p>

<p>A huge smile spread across Sam's face as she listened to words Brooke sang
out melodically.  S Club 7, a week ago she would have had a field day with
that, but then and there she simply found it utterly charming.  The blonde
actually had a beautiful singing voice, but bewilderingly-considering that
she was a cheerleader and a debater and an all around popular girl-she
seemed to have some sort of phobia singing in public.  Sam guessed that she
and Mr. McQueen were probably the only two people to have been blessed with
the gift of hearing her sing.  Still, that didn't mean Sam wasn't going to
exploit the situation if only just a little bit.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind her, Sam moved into the room carefully, trying not
to enter Brooke's line of vision as she snuck up, then once she was in
position she grabbed the dancing queen from behind.</p>

<p>Brooke yelped and yanked her headphones off spinning around to face Sam.</p>

<p>"Don't.  Do.  That," the cheerleader said, carefully annunciating every word
as she tried to slow her heart down.</p>

<p>"Come on," Sam said maneuvering behind Brooke once again, her hands
attaching themselves to the blonde's waist.  "Let's see some s-e-x in those
h-i-p's," she continued moving her own hips against Brooke.</p>

<p>"You know," Brooke said gamely moving along with Sam, "every year that you
shave off my life by scaring the shit out of me is a year that you're going
to have to live without me and my sunshine."</p>

<p>"You and your what?" Sam asked dangerously as her hands trailed up Brooke's
side.</p>

<p>"Me and my sunshine," Brooke responded even though she knew it was going to
get her in trouble.</p>

<p>"What was that again?" Sam asked as her hands inched their way under
Brooke's shirt.</p>

<p>"Sunshine," Brooke repeated, her body torn between excitement and
nervousness.</p>

<p>"Sunshine did you say?" Sam asked as she began to tickle Brooke's side.
"What's that I can't quite hear you?" the brunette continued smiling as the
blonde squirmed in her hands trying to escape her tyrannical grasp.</p>

<p>Brooke stumbled about the room trying to twist out of Sam's grasp as the
brunette continued to talk to her in a highly amused tone.  Finally reaching
the edge of her bed Brooke flung herself down onto it hoping to break Sam's
hold on her.  It worked, and once they were both lying on the bed Brooke
quickly pressed her advantage rolling over on top of Sam and sitting up so
that she was straddling her waist.</p>

<p>"Now who's the Queen of the castle?" Brooke asked smugly, her hands
playfully rambling up Sam's sides.</p>

<p>"You know what they say," Sam responded not even pretending like she wanted
to get out of Brooke's grasp.  "Behind every great ruler is an even greater
woman," she continued smiling.</p>

<p>"My better half," Brooke mumbled leaning down.</p>

<p>"Better looking definitely," Sam replied just before Brooke's lips reached
hers.</p>

<p>"Ohhh," Brooke responded turning her head to the side a mocking look of pain
covering her face.  "You're a mean one Mrs. Grinch," and with that she
smiled and leaned down once again drawing Sam into a kiss.</p>

<p>Sam felt Brooke's hand begin to make it's way under her shirt and quickly
reversed the situation so that she was now on top.  "Ah, ah, ah," Sam tisked
looking down at Brooke.  "You've got to begin to learn how to control
yourself.  I know I'm a sexy bitch, but you've got to learn restraint," Sam
continued a sexy smile spreading across her face.  "The parental units are
coming back today, which means no more naughty, naughty touching for
Brookie, Brookie."</p>

<p>"They're not home yet," Brooke responded as her hands resumed where they had
left off.  "Waste not, want not Sam.  We should make good use of what time
we have left."</p>

<p>Sam looked up at the face above hers, a soft smile coming across her face.
The mood had been light until that moment, that instant that Sam looked up
into Brooke's face.  But after that she felt a considerable change within
herself.  At that moment that she looked into Brooke's eyes she was overcome
with emotion, her mind running wild with thoughts of how when she kissed
Brooke she felt like all four winds were blowing against her face.  Of how
she felt like she was being picked up and carried away to a land of warmth,
and peace and love.  Of how she loved the way Brooke made her feel and she
loved the fact that everything Brooke inspired in her she too inspired in
Brooke.  And of how she loved the silky texture of Brooke's hair, and the
multitude of colours within her eyes expressing her every emotion if one
only looked, and the way the skin at the corner of her eyes crinkled when
she smiled.  She thought of how much she loved Brooke, and then she rose up
and brought their lips together.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Brooke asked, seeing the somewhat amazed look on Sam's face
previous to the other girl kissing her, as she ran a hand through her hair
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I..." Sam started then stopped suddenly finding herself at a loss for words.
She brought her hands to Brooke's face, softly tracing the contours of her
features, almost as if she were trying to burn them into her memory forever
more.  "I feel so much when I'm with you," she finally said softly.  "I want
to tell you...but there aren't any other words...except...I love you," she
finished quietly.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes fluttered shut momentarily after the last of Sam's words left
her mouth.  When her eyes finally opened they shimmered with unshed tears
and her mouth opened as if she were about to say something.  She wanted to
say something, something important, something revealing, something erudite,
and meaningful that would resound throughout the rest of their lives
together.  But all that she managed was "I..." before Sam leaned up and
brought their lips together once more, and suddenly whatever Brooke had
wanted to say didn't seem so important anymore, because she was able to show
Sam what needed to know.</p>

<p>Jane held the door open for Mike as they entered the house.  As he placed
them down, she turned to face him.</p>

<p>"Silence, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?"</p>

<p>He turned to face her and they looked at each other for a moment then made a
bee-line for the stairs.  About half way up however, Jane stopped mid
stride.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" she asked in a hushed tone.</p>

<p>"It sounds almost like..." Mike began.</p>

<p>"Laughter," Jane finished for him.</p>

<p>"That's good right?" he asked turning to face his fianc=E9.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" she responded even though it came out sounding more like a question.
  "Where's it coming from?"</p>

<p>"It sounds like Brooke's room," he replied.</p>

<p>Cautiously they approached the door to Brooke's room.  As they neared it
they confirmed that the sound they had heard previously was indeed laughter.
  Strictly female laughter Mike noted with a touch of relief.</p>

<p>"It must be...Sam?" Jane asked hopefully.  Mike shrugged and reached out
knocking on the door.</p>

<p>The moment the knock sounded all sounds in the room ceased and desisted ,
blanketing the house in silence.  A moment later they heard Brooke yell out,
"Just a minute", which was followed by muffled voices, silence, more muffled
voices, a loud thud and finally, "come in."</p>

<p>Walking in the adults took in the sight of the room before them.  The
comforter of Brooke's bed was lying crumpled on the floor, the chair from
her vanity mirror was knocked over and the room seemed to just be in a
general state of disarray.  As for the occupants of the room, Brooke was
standing by the side of her bed looking at them through her eyelashes with
both of her hands shoved in her pockets and her head down.  Sam was on the
other side of the bed leaning against the closet door, one of her hands
draped across her stomach and the other covering her mouth.</p>

<p>"Is everything alright here?" Mike asked, the disheveled appearance of the
room clashing painfully in his mind with the sounds they had heard earlier.
It looked like the aftermath of war or at least a colonial dispute, yet all
other evidence was pointing to the fact that the girls had been getting
along prior to their arrival.</p>

<p>"Of course," Brooke answered forcing a look of bewilderment on her face,
conveying what she hoped was a look of utter confusion as to how things
could be anything other than okay.  "Welcome back," she continued yanking
her hands out of pockets and crossing the room with her arms open for hugs.</p>

<p>After Brooke had finished with them and retreated to her former position Sam
made her way over and shrugging indifferently opened her arms and hugged
them both too before she retreated as well.</p>

<p>"So," Mike started slightly put off by the girls behavior, especially
Sam's-prior to five seconds before he had been hard pressed to get anything
other than a smile and a nod out of the girl and she just hugged him.  It
didn't compute.  "Did you two manage to get along while we were gone?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."  "Um hmmm," came the simultaneously replies.</p>

<p>"I see," he responded turning to look at Jane to see if she found their
behavior as strange as he did.  "Well that's...good."</p>

<p>"Yeah."  "Um hmmm," came their responses once more.</p>

<p>"Have you two been rooming together or something?" Jane asked as she spotted
a pair of Sam's pants and one of her shirts lying in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>Sam looked up sharply at the question looking at her mother wide eyed while
Brooke turned and looked at Sam sharply.  They had to keep level heads, she
didn't know anything, it was just a simple question.  All they had to do was
play it cool.  Brooke sighed deeply, they were in trouble.</p>

<p>"WewerejustgoingoutonenightandItriedonsomeofBrooke'sandleftminehere," Sam
responded almost unintelligibly, a smile quickly appearing on her face and
then disappearing just as quickly as she returned her gaze to the ground.</p>

<p>"They're spending quality time together," Jane commented smiling.  "Isn't
that nice?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." "Um hmmm," the two girls responded once again causing the adults to
look at them strangely.</p>

<p>"We should go unpack," Mike commented a moment later.  Though it was true he
found the girls behavior perplexing, they were teenagers and he had always
found them somewhat perplexing so he really wasn't too concerned.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jane responded somewhat more reluctant to just accept their bizarre
behavior.  There was one thing in particular that was nagging at her but she
just couldn't seem to place it at the moment.</p>

<p>As they made there way out of the room, it suddenly struck Jane what was so
odd about the situation and she turned around.</p>

<p>"Sam?" she asked.  Her daughter looked up at her, her face not giving away
anything more than mere curiously.  "Why is your shirt on inside out?"</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked though she looked down at herself as the words left her
mouth.  Sure enough her shirt was on the wrong side.  As she looked down in
a mild panic, her face began to flush and she turned to look at Brooke who
was now covering her face with her hand.  They had been in a state of
semi-undress when they had heard the knock at the door and after an initial
moment of panic they had started to scramble around the room trying to find
the articles of clothing they had thrown about.  They thought they had it
covered when Brooke tossed Sam her shirt...but apparently not.</p>

<p>Brooke, who had been trying to control her laughter since almost the moment
their parents walked in finally lost it seeing the look on Sam's face and
broke out laughing.  Jane and Mike turned to each other not knowing what was
so funny about the situation, but finding it mildly amusing because of
Brooke's reaction nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Sam muttered in Brooke's direction as she tugged at her shirt.
"It's all your fault."</p>

<p>"My fault?" Brooke asked incredulously in between laughing fits.  "You came
in here, remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes I remember.  Do you remember 'waste not want not Sam'," the brunette
shot back at her.  It was no use however, Brooke had fallen onto the bed
still laughing, and Jane and Mike had quietly exited the room not quite sure
what to make of the situation.</p>

<p>"That was...odd," Mike commented as they made their way to their bedroom.</p>

<p>"To say the least," Jane agreed.  "But, at least they're getting along now."</p>
