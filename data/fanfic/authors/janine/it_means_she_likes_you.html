<p>Brooke raised her eyebrows in a haughty and mocking
fashion.  "Journalist?" she asked incredulously.  "Journalist?" she
asked again, feeling the need to stress just how ridiculous she found
the notion.  "You're like the…the Lisa Ling of journalism.  You're
all `look at me, I'm talking out of my ass about things I know
nothing about!  Hey, I have a loud and grating voice, pay attention
to me!'  Having the mentality of a paparazzi and the ethics of a
lawyer doesn't make you a journalist, it makes you annoying as hell,"
she continued as her arms fluttered about scornfully while she made
quotations marks with her fingers.  </p>

<p>When she finished with her theatrics she focused all of her attention
on Sam, watching her intently.  At first the brunette was merely
looking at her, but the longer the silence between them remained the
more tightly drawn Sam's features became.  Soon her mouth formed a
grim line and her nostrils flared slightly.  </p>

<p>Brooke struggled to maintain her stoic expression as she sensed Sam
about to explode at her.  There was a fluttering in her stomach, her
body suddenly felt energized.  She wanted to dance like a dervish or
sing like a lark, maybe even cross the room doing cartwheels.  The
longer it took Sam to respond to her, the more excited she became.
The prudent thing to do would have been to consider her reactions, to
try and figure out why the inevitability of Sam bitching her out made
her giddy.  That would have been the prudent thing to do, which is
exactly why Brooke didn't do it.  She didn't want to examine what was
going on her mind; she didn't want to know why she had started
provoking Sam on purpose just so that she could see the other girl's
responses.  She didn't want to know why arguing with Sam made her
body tingle.  She just wanted to do it, so she did.</p>

<p>"More brilliant observations from everyone's favorite head-trauma
victim," Sam growled out as she watched Brooke through narrow eyes.
Brooke watched her with an unwavering stare; in fact Sam was sure
that the blonde hadn't even blinked since she had stopped speaking
almost a minute ago.  She didn't know why, but there was something
unnerving, yet fascinating about the way Brooke was watching her.
All of the cheerleader's attention seemed to be focused on her; Sam
was almost positive that there could have been an explosion outside
and Brooke wouldn't have even noticed.  She could feel herself
flushing under the other girl's scrutiny.  "Don't you have a tic -
tac to go throw-up?" Sam ground out unthinkingly a moment later,
desperate to make Brooke look elsewhere.  The moment the words came
out of her mouth she regretted them and wished she could reach out
her hand and grab them up before they had a chance to reach Brooke's
ears, but she couldn't, and seconds after she spoke she saw Brooke's
eyes widen and her face fall then freeze up.</p>

<p>Brooke took a step back.  She felt like she had just been slapped.
She had wanted to see Sam's passion, but that was too much of it.
She wanted to act extremely hurt, demand of Sam how she could say
something like that knowing what she had gone through with her eating
disorder.  She wanted to but she couldn't quite work up the levels of
hypocrisy necessary to bitch the other girl out about the matter.
She had wanted to evoke a response, which meant she didn't have the
right to get pissy because the response she got happened to have
ripped her heart out.</p>

<p>"Brooke, I…" Sam started to say the moment she saw how Brooke had
responded.  Brooke was moving away from her, blinking rapidly now, as
if trying to make up for her earlier negligence, her blue eyes now
gazing at the carpet instead of Sam.  Strangely, Sam noted as Brooke
wrapped her arms around her lithe form protectively, she realized
that she missed having the cheerleader's clear orbs trained on her.
She almost felt as if someone had taken away her blanket.  </p>

<p>Looking at Brooke, hunched over and small, Sam was over taken by the
urge to hug her.  To try and wipe away the pain that was so clearly
written over Brooke's features but trying not to show.  She took a
step forward, as if to actualize her musings, but just as quickly as
she started forward she stopped again.  Brooke was looking at her
again, she could feel it, and tilting her head up she saw that she
was right.  The blonde's eyes seemed a bit watery, but she wasn't
crying, she was simply watching — or was it waiting — for Sam's
approach.  In fact she looked almost expectant.  This irritated Sam
for some reason, and with the irritation came retrospection.  Brooke
had started this all, why the hell should she be the one who was
apologizing?  She shouldn't be was the conclusion she came to.  She
was the one who should be angry.  Hell, she didn't even know how the
argument had started in the first place.</p>

<p>"You know what?" Sam asked meeting Brooke's gaze.  Brooke merely
raised her eyebrow in response.  "Screw you!" Sam declared.  Brooke
looked surprised by the exclamation, her eyes widening perceptively
and her mouth opening slightly.  This just drove Sam on, she hadn't
realized it until a few moments ago, but Brooke had really been
bothering her for past couple of weeks.  It had started out slowly,
almost insidiously; After getting along relatively well for a month
or so one day Brooke had finished off the milk and put the empty
carton back in the fridge, this led to Sam trying to pour a carton of
nothing on her cereal.  Sam accused Brooke, Brooke told her to kiss
off and they had gotten into their first real fight in quite some
time.</p>

<p>After that incident they had had a few more fights, and then a few
more fights, and by the time this week had rolled around they seemed
to be arguing about things daily.  At first, Sam had to admit, she
had started most of the arguments as Brooke seemed to have an innate
ability to piss her off in the worst way, but as of late Brooke had
been the perpetrator in almost all cases, sometimes actually pushing
Sam into yelling at her when the brunette was willing to take the
high road and walk away from it all.</p>

<p>"What the hell is the matter with you anyway?" Sam shot at Brooke
angrily as she worked her way up into a great big soapy lather of
indignation.</p>

<p>"Whatever are you talking about?" Brooke responded batting her eyes
at Sam innocently, knowing it would irritate the brunette to no end.
Sam stared at her in amazement; the goddamn girl had actually batted
her eyes.  Sam stared at her dumbly for a minute, as she watched
Brooke standing there like Shirley fucking Temple, but she didn't
feel as annoyed as she had anticipated.  Instead, strangely, Sam
found herself trying to not to smile.  The gesture had actually been
cute, Brooke with those bloody doe eyes of hers had actually charmed
her, but Sam shook those thoughts out off her head.  She had a
cheerleader to land blast after all.  </p>

<p>"Listen, I don't know what's going on with you," Sam started in a
more reasonable tone.  "But you've been an absolute horror to live
with for the past month, and I'd like it stop.  I don't know how to
make it stop other than to say, if you need an ear, or shoulder, or
whatever, you know where I live," she continued somewhat
uncomfortably, "because, and know that it pains me to admit this, I
kind of liked it when we were being civil to each other.  I kind of
like you…you know when you're not acting like a complete asshole,"
she finished surprising herself with the last part of her little
speech.  She hadn't meant to say that, but reflecting on it she
realized it was true.  She and Brooke had spent a lot of time
together once moving into the same house, and even if it was grudging
at first they had learned a lot about each other, and Sam had
thought, come to not merely tolerate each other, but genuinely like
each other, somewhat.  If Brooke had been anyone but Brooke, Sam
would have used the term `friend', maybe even `good friend' to
describe her.  Living with her day in, day out, seeing her at her
worst and — Sam hoped — at her best, Brooke probably knew all of her
better than anyone.</p>

<p>"I," Brooke started opening and closing her mouth.  "I don't know,"
she mumbled a moment later.  The excitement she had felt earlier was
now ebbing away like the retreating tide leaving her feeling rather
wiped out.  Raising her hand she tucked a strand of hair behind her
ear uncomfortably.  The fact was that she liked it when they were
being civil towards each other too, but she also liked it when they
were fighting with each other.  It was extremely confusing, even to
her.  Truthfully, she couldn't answer Sam because she didn't know
what was wrong with her, she truly missed hearing Sam rattle on about
something or other she had read in the newspaper her voice ringing
with excitement and annoyance — especially when she thought Brooke
had stopped paying attention to her even though Brooke was always
paying attention, just trying to act like she wasn't.  But, Brooke
considered, when Sam was rattling on she missed feeling those darkly
intense, sparkling eyes staring at her, burning into her like a
molten poker, like they did when they were arguing.</p>

<p>"You don't know?" Sam asked flatly.  After the vicious verbal skills
Brooke had demonstrated mere minutes ago, Sam had expected more from
the girl than `I don't know'.  </p>

<p>Brooke quirked her head to the side and lifted up her shoulders in a
lost and helpless gesture.  "I … don't know," she repeated finally
shrugging again as her eyes skittered around the room helplessly.
Finally, however, she focused on Sam again, her eyebrows drawn
together with an intense look of consternation, her bottom lip firmly
ensnared between her teeth which gnawed on the tender flesh
absently.  With her brows still drawn together she released her lip
and said in a slow, halting voice, "I…would like for us…to get along
again…as well," she paused there for a second, then opened her mouth
as if to say something else but closed it again without emoting
anything.</p>

<p>"If you mean that," Sam responded somewhat disconcerted, yet also
disarmed, by Brooke's behavior, "then why are you trying — and
succeeding I'll admit — to Melrose Place our every interaction?"</p>

<p>"I'm not," was Brooke's immediate high-pitched response.</p>

<p>"Yes you are," Sam insisted taking a few steps towards the blonde.
She had been angry before, and she still was a little bit, but more
than that she was intrigued.  When Brooke said she didn't know why
she was acting the way she was Sam had actually believed her.
Shocking, but true.  Brooke's argument was weak to be certain, and
coming from anyone else at any other time Sam probably wouldn't have
believed it.  But, standing there in front of her, Brooke had looked
even more confused than Sam, and that interested her.  She wanted to
know what could possibly be going on in Brooke's brain that made what
she was doing a mystery even to her.</p>

<p>"Am not," Brooke replied forcefully, though her voice still came out
higher than normal.  She just couldn't help herself.</p>

<p>"Are too," Sam, responded unable to stop herself from sinking to
Brooke's pre-school level as she moved to stand right in front of
Brooke.  She was all up in the blondes face, and she kind of liked it.</p>

<p>"Am.  Not," Brooke replied jutting her head forward antagonizing as
she carefully annunciated each word.  As their conversation started
to thread towards more familiar territory she felt that bubbling in
her stomach again, that fluttering excitement.  This time however,
she paid attention to her response, though she still didn't
understand it.  She was the kind of person who usually avoided
confrontation; it made her uneasy and usually left her upset.  The
fights that she'd had with Sam before and after the McPherson's first
moved in had always left her with a queasy feeling in her stomach and
unshed tears burning her eyes.  She had hated fighting with Sam, and
hated Sam for compelling her to fight back.  When they had started to
bond with each other, to really get along, Brooke had been
understandably relieved.  Having the house no longer feel like a war
zone had been a welcome change, and in times of distress or worry,
Brooke had actually found that it was nice to have Sam around, most
of the time.  Since she felt the brunette didn't think much of her
anyway she was able to be completely honest with her because there
was nothing to lose with Sam.  </p>

<p>Then they had gotten into that fight about the milk, and Brooke found
that in the course of a month her feeling about altercations — at
least one's involving Sam — had flopped over completely, and as much
as she had loathed fighting before she liked it now.  It made her
feel close to Sam, and for some reason that was important to her.</p>

<p>"You see!  There you go again, turning things into a school yard
shoving match," Sam exclaimed poking Brooke in the chest.  Frankly,
she had half expected the cheerleader to insult her mother.  "You
know what's wrong with you?" Sam asked a second later as she observed
the cheerleader.  "You're emotionally handicapped," she
stated.   "You're a six year who doesn't know how to properly express
themselves, so you create an emotional island so you won't have to
deal with your sad inability to relate to people on a deeper level."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sally Jessie," Brooke responded sarcastically, even
though she kind of thought Sam had a point.  "This weeks show has
been brought to you by `I don't give a shit'.  Thank you and
goodnight," Brooke continued bowing slightly, her gaze challenging
Sam to respond to her.</p>

<p>The brunette observed Brooke for a moment, taking in those shimmering
blue eyes, and that lithe, secretly tattered body, that sought to
provoke her with its every motion.  Her chest suddenly felt heavy,
she became tired.  She didn't want to do this.  Fighting with Brooke
had been fun when she hadn't liked Brooke, but now that things had
changed — more than she would have liked to admit — and she liked
Brooke, what was happening saddened her deeply.  She might not be
able to stop the downward spiral they were on, but she could retire
from the stage.  She was no longer going to enable whatever was going
on, she simply couldn't do it anymore.</p>

<p>"You know what, I'm not going to do this anymore," she said breaking
the long silence.  "Just cancel my subscription, because I'm over
your issues," she continued in a steady voice but with sad eyes.  "If
you wanna act like some little kid begging for a spanking, fine.
It's your therapy bill," she continued feeling like she had just been
bitch slapped like nobody's business.  With that she stepped away
from Brooke and turned around heading for the door.  She had no idea
what had happened over the last half hour or so; just that she was
now tired as hell, more than a little depressed, and she wanted to
lie down.  </p>

<p>As she walked away, she realized, that it almost felt as if she could
feel Brooke slipping away from with every step she took, and she was
startled to realize that she had ever felt Brooke with her to begin
with.  And, as this chasm between them grew out of only God knew what
Sam felt the lack of Brooke's friendship — or whatever it was that
Brooke had provided her with, for she wasn't exactly sure what it
was, only that it was leaving — acutely.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke called out just as the brunette reached for the
doorknob.  "Wait … please," she continued crossing the room.  Things
couldn't go on like this she knew that, the knowledge of it slammed
into chest with the ferocity of a sledge hammer as she watched Sam
walk away from her.  Whatever was going on with her she wanted to
know, she had to know because it was driving something between, and
the thought that whatever it was might win terrified her.  "I'm
sorry.  Really," she said stopping halfway to Sam when she saw that
the other girl had stopped moving, the door still locked, the knob
left unturned.  She took a deep breath, closing her eyes as she
exhaled before lifting her face up to look at Sam once more.  "The
thing is…that I don't know what the thing is," she started in an
uncertain voice.  "It seems that I'm rather confused at the moment…
and have been for a while I guess," she continued slowly, "and I
really do want to know why."  Her voice cracked, her tone soft,
almost broken.  "But…I can't do it by myself.  That is to say that…"</p>

<p>"Sit down," Sam interjected, interrupting Brooke's speech.  Brooke
looked at her questioningly, but Sam merely nodded in the direction
of the bed obviously meaning for Brooke to sit down.  So that's what
Brooke did.</p>

<p>After Brooke seated herself, Sam watched her for a second.  Her knees
were pushed together and her hands were neatly folded in her lap,
making her look to the entire world like she was as meek as a rabbit
and just as precious.  For the second time that afternoon Sam was
overcome with the powerful urge to just wrap her arms around Brooke
and rock whatever was wrong with her way.  And thought the thought
surprised her, it didn't alarm her as much as she thought it would.  </p>

<p>After a moment's more deliberation Sam crossed the distance over to
the bed and sat down beside Brooke.  "That can't be comfortable," she
commented lightly, shifting her own position so that she was sitting
crossed legged in the middle of the bed.</p>

<p>"This is how teacher always made us sit when we had been naughty in
school," Brooke responded with a sly sort of grin.  Sam quirked her
eyebrow at the blonde but didn't say anything.  Brooke quickly
changed her position so that she too was sitting cross-legged
opposite Sam, then once she was settle turned her gaze to Sam
expectantly.  "What now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" Sam responded.</p>

<p>"You're the one who was issuing the orders," Brooke commented
reasonably.  "I'm the clueless one remember.  Certainly you don't
want me leading the whatever it is we're going to do."</p>

<p>"The stupid leading the blind, or the blind leading the stupid," Sam
commented.  "This is like some screwed up Chinese proverb," she went
on shaking her head ruefully.</p>

<p>"I want you to know that I take umbrage to that description," Brooke
responded shaking her finger in Sam's direction. </p>

<p>"Which one?" Sam asked mostly to stall for time as she tried to think
of something to ask Brooke that would lead them to enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Either one," Brooke responded.</p>

<p>"You're objection has been noted and filed under `Eh'," Sam replied
as she shrugged her shoulders.  Brooke smirked at her momentarily,
her eyes dancing, but as soon as the expression appeared on her face
it was gone as the blonde lowered her head.</p>

<p>Brooke tugged on her sock lightly as they sat in silence, her gaze
occasionally drifting up to observe Sam before returning to her sock
tugging with a renewed vigor.  She could feel Sam's eyes on her,
watching her, but she didn't mind it like she thought she would, she
actually found it comforting.  She felt almost protected by it.</p>

<p>"You don't think you're pregnant again do you?" Sam asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"That's not a possibility," Brooke responded looking up at Sam with a
smile.  The brunette smirked back at her and for a moment they sat
there staring at each other with matching grins.  After a moment or
two however, when the prolonged eye contact became uncomfortable, Sam
looked away, turning her head to look out the window hoping that the
break would allow her time to get her suddenly erratic breathing
under control.  Brooke, on the other hand, continued to watch Sam
after the brunette had turned her head.  At first she had thought she
was just observing her, but soon she realized that she was studying
Sam's body: the way she stuck in tongue into her check, the graceful
lines of her neck, her elegant and slender shoulders, the gentle
curve of her waist.  She realized she was trying to take all of Sam
in, memorize her.  But why?</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked.  The blonde blinked, jerking her head back with
a disoriented look on her face as she looked over at Sam.  Sam's face
was slightly flushed colouring her chest a tender shade of pink,
which drew Brooke's attention to the `V' of Sam's shirt where it
stayed concentrated for longer than could be considered
polite.  "Brooke?" Sam asked again shifting under the blonde's gaze.
Maddeningly, she felt herself grow even more flustered by Brooke's
concentrated look—or was it by the fact that she found herself
enjoying Brooke's concentrated look?  She wasn't sure.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Brooke said snapping herself out of whatever fog had
momentarily enveloped her.  "What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Sam responded relieved and disappointed at Brooke's now
mild expression.  "I was going to ask you," she started then
stopped.  She couldn't remember what she was going to ask her.  "I
was going to ask you…" she repeated, stalling for all that she was
worth, "have you been fighting with everyone lately, or just me?" she
finally decided on.  She wasn't sure if that had been her original
question, but it seemed like a good one.</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment her attention returning to severely
abused socks before looking over at Sam somewhat sadly.  "Just you,"
she responded in a somewhat guilty tone.</p>

<p>"Oh," Sam replied at a bit of a loss.  That wasn't what she had
wanted to hear.  In all honesty it upset her to some extent.
Whatever was bothering Brooke had to do with her.  If Brooke had been
fighting with everyone, that would have meant that it was a general
problem, but this, this meant that whatever it was was solely about
their relationship with each other.</p>

<p>"I don't think," Brooke started seeing Sam's somewhat crestfallen
expression, "I mean, it's me, you know?  Something's just wrong with
me…you shouldn't take it personally," she continued trying to take
some of the sting out of what she had said.  That, and she also
happened to believe what she was saying.  Sam hadn't done anything to
upset her, just the opposite in fact, she felt closer to the other
girl lately than ever before, it just seemed to be manifesting itself
in strange way that was making her act like a jerk.</p>

<p>"It obviously has something to do with me," Sam responded in what she
hoped was a light tone.  "Did I do something to…"</p>

<p>"No.  I mean, I'll never put an empty milk carton in the fridge
again, but…it's just this feeling I get.  I don't know why, but
lately…lately it's like I have to fight with you.  Have to," Brooke
responded stressing the word `have' as she interrupted Sam's
question.  </p>

<p>"You said it's this feeling you get," Sam replied not quite sure how
to interrupt what Brooke had just told her.  "What feeling?  What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>Brooke sighed and raised her hand up to her face anxiously, rubbing
at her eye with the ball of her hand.  "It's strong," she said
finally as she thought about all of the things she felt before and
during an argument.  She shook her head again.  "It makes no sense."</p>

<p>"What makes no sense?" Sam asked.  She was still only getting
fragments, she needed more.</p>

<p>"The feeling," Brooke responded somewhat flustered as thoughts
continued to stream through her head.  "It's like we'll just be doing
whatever you know, getting along fine and stuff, and I'll just look
over at you and …" she trailed off here, her eyes losing focus as she
retreated into her own head.</p>

<p>"And what?" Sam asked unconsciously leaning towards Brooke, her
elbows resting on her knees.</p>

<p>"And I just…I just HAVE to piss you off," Brooke responded, her voice
as bewildered as her expression.  "I told you it makes no sense.  I'm
never mad at you, or even irritated or anything, it's just like one
moment everything is fine and then I feel this, this thing inside of
me, and I just need to make you mad."  `I need to see it', she added
to herself mentally as she stopped speaking.</p>

<p>Sam was silent after Brooke finished speaking, remaining in the same
position she had occupied before the revelation only with her eyes
now facing down.  What the hell did it mean?  Brooke felt the need to
piss her off; Sam didn't even know where to begin with that one.  She
tried to consider it reasonably, but she didn't really understand
what she was being asked to consider.  If Brooke kept doing it, it
meant that she had to be getting something out of it, but what?  What
could possibly be the reason?</p>

<p>"I told you, it doesn't make sense.  It's not you.  I'm just cracking
up," Brooke continued when Sam neglected to respond to her previous
statements.  Despite her words however, Brooke could feel the
beginnings of an idea tickling the back of her brain, screaming to be
fully realized, to be heard.  But she was scared, she wasn't sure if
she wanted to hear what they had to say, in fact she was fairly
certain that  it wouldn't be anything she wanted anyway.</p>

<p>"What do you feel?  When we're arguing I mean," Sam asked looking
over a Brooke intently.</p>

<p>Brooke stared at her for a moment, then looked away uncomfortably.
Sam watched as Brooke turned away from her, turned to stare at some
distant spot on the other side of the room.  From her vantage point
she could see that Brooke was blinking more than was usual, as least
she assumed it was more that usual because she was able to detect it,
and that her bottom lip was once again ensnared between her teeth.
One of the blonde's feet was moving up and down giggling her body,
and her left hand was constantly moving as if it was tucking away a
stray strand of hair, only none of Brooke's hair was astray.  Brooke
was nervous Sam realized, really nervous.  The question she asked,
that's where the heart of the matter was.  All she had to do was get
an answer to that question.</p>

<p>"What do you feel Brooke?" she asked again leaning forward a bit
more.  Brooke still didn't respond to her.  Sam sighed and considered
her options, she could just walk away but that wouldn't solve
anything.  It was clear to her that Brooke wanted to end this
situation between them as much as she did, so that meant that she had
to keep trying until she got through.  Persistence was one of her
virtues wasn't it?</p>

<p>Sam shifted her position so that she was kneeling on the bed and
leaned even closer to Brooke.  "What do you feel?" she asked again.</p>

<p>Brooke turned her head this time something in Sam's tone or proximity
forcing her to face the girl.  However, she didn't realize how close
to her Sam actually was and when she turned it startled both of them
throwing Sam off balance which led the brunette to fall towards
Brooke knocking into her which tipped them both over leaving Brooke
lying flat on her back and Sam semi-straddling Brooke's body which
was now beneath her.</p>

<p>"What do you feel?" Sam breathed out again in this position, unable
to stop herself from asking it even though she knew she should
probably have been extracting herself from Brooke's body instead of
questioning her.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes fluttered shut momentarily as she felt Sam's warm
breath against her face as the brunette whispered to her.  She could
feel her temperature rising as she became aware of the weight of
Sam's body against hers, the warmth of her thighs which were pressed
against Brooke's sides holding her in place, the snug way Sam's body
fit against Brooke's hip.  Brooke felt a familiar fluttering in her
stomach, only this time it was ten times stronger.  Her body was
screaming with energy, her head swimming.  Her lips parted
imperceptivity and her eyes fluttered to Sam's face, which was only
inches away from hers.  The brunette's attention was locked on her
and Brooke knew that Sam was carefully observing her, but she
couldn't stop her eyes from wondering down to Sam's lips, red, wet
and luscious.  Her breath hitched.  And, it didn't stop Brooke's eyes
from then wondering even further to the porcelain plains of Sam's
neck and then further still to the now visible swell of Sam's
breasts, which were rising and falling gently, seductively with each
breath she took.</p>

<p>"This," Brooke barely breathed out thunderstruck.  Her head was
spinning and her body, well, that wasn't co-operating with her
either.  All she could think about was how she wanted to feel more of
Sam against her.  How more than anything in the world, more than
oxygen, more that sunlight, she wanted to touch Sam, to feel her
everywhere.  She wanted her, Brooke wanted Sam in the worst way
imaginable, and she realized that she had wanted her for a while.
She wasn't fighting with Sam out of anger; it was out of sexual
frustration, because it was the only way she had known up until then
to see Sam's passion.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked softly.  She could see, and feel Brooke's eyes
roaming over her, almost leering at her.  She could see Brooke's eyes
gradually change colour; they became darker and richer, and as Sam
watched Brooke she felt her own heart rate increase in time with the
blondes.</p>

<p>"I feel this," Brooke responded, her eyes once against locked on
Sam's lips.  As she spoke she realized that her hand was now resting
at the side of Sam's face, her thumb gently stroking the soft skin of
Sam's cheek.  "I'm sorry," she whispered a second later knowing
without a doubt that she was going to kiss Sam very, very soon.</p>

<p>"For wh…" Sam started to say, but the feel of Brooke's lips pressing
against hers, moving against hers tenderly yet invitingly silenced
her.  She felt surprise, and alarm, she was sure of that, she
remembered feeling them distinctly, but as soon as they appeared they
retreated, leaving something warm in their wake.  She felt herself
lean in, increasing the contact between their lips, and then the
contact between their bodies as Brooke's tongue traced her bottom lip
sucking on it sweetly before Sam's mouth opened inviting Brooke in.</p>

<p>The increased strength of their kiss caused Brooke to fall back
against the mattress, her back no longer able to hold out as she
leaned up to kiss Sam, the contact between their mouths breaking
momentarily as Brooke fell back.  However, almost as soon as she was
settled against the mattress Sam's mouth descended upon hers
capturing the cheerleaders lips hungrily as her hand made its way
behind Brooke's neck and Brooke's hand snaked it's way up Sam's side
tangling in her dark tresses.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam said softly, finally managing to tear herself away from
the blondes tantalizing lips and body.  Looking down she saw that
Brooke's lips were redder than usual, and slightly swollen.  Idly,
she wondered how long they had been kissing for, it could easily have
been seconds or minutes or hours.</p>

<p>"Um hmmm," Brooke responded, her mumble coming out sounding dreamy as
she stared up into Sam's beautiful brown eyes.  If this was dream,
she didn't want to wake up.  </p>

<p>"Do you know why you were fighting with me now?" Sam asked, her lips
twitching into a playful smile.</p>

<p>"It means I like you," Brooke responded in a like tone as she raised
her hand to Sam's face, gazing at her reverently.  "You know, in my
emotionally handicapped way," she added with a smile as her other
hand started to trail along Sam's ribcage, gently exploring.</p>

<p>"I think," Sam started leaning into Brooke's touch, her eyes
fluttering shut for a second, "that we've found a more productive way
for you to express these emotions now," she continued before turning
her head to the side placing a kiss on the tip of Brooke's thumb
before sucking the digit into her mouth.  </p>

<p>As Sam's mouth enveloped her thumb, Brooke's mouth opened a tiny
whimper coming out of her as she involuntarily arched up towards
Sam.  "Sam," she said gravely when she had regained the ability to
speak.  "I'm getting that feeling again," she continued as her finger
slid out of Sam's mouth with a `pop'.</p>

<p>"See," Sam said leaning down briefly brushing her lips against
Brooke's.  "I knew I should've taken it personally."</p>

<p>"Sammy," Brooke breathed out, a mischievous smile tugging at the
corners of her lips.  "Shut up and kiss me."  And that's just what
she did…for hours…and then a couple of times for good luck.</p>
