<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 26 -->

<p>Jane walked by Sam’s room, the door was open and as she passed by her eye
caught a hold of the poster on the back wall and she stopped to take a good
look at it.  The poster was of Shania Twain, she of mid-rift greatness, and
looking at the poster seriously for the first time Jane suddenly realized
that Shania wasn’t really wearing a whole lot of anything.  In fact, from
Shania’s expression she decided that  the songs-tress wasn’t so much taking
a picture as she was making love to the camera.  Jane began to realize that
this poster was promising sex; Shania was promising sex to the owner of the
poster, which in this case would be her daughter.  Jane turned away from the
poster and resumed her course down stairs with a new and intense dislike of
Shania Twain and her lyrics about feeling women.</p>

<p>As Jane entered the dining room she observed Brooke strut into the living
room, apparently just back from practice since she was till in her uniform,
where Sam was working.  Momentarily side-tracked, she watched as they
greeted each other warmly—which really wasn’t so extraordinary as it had
become their custom.  Sam put down her pencil and made some comment to
Brooke that Jane couldn’t hear but which she assumed was funny since it made
Brooke smile.  Truthfully, it wasn’t the friendly banter that interested
Jane so much as it was Sam’s reaction to Brooke.  From the moment the blonde
entered the room Sam had focused her undivided attention on her, and this is
what kept Jane watching them from her secret position, even though she felt
ashamed of herself for spying.</p>

<p>They continued to speak for a minute before Brooke plucked something out of
her bag and walked over to the stereo system.  As she did this Jane watched
Sam watching Brooke.  The brunette’s eyes drew over the blonde’s body,
positively raking over her partially clad form, a wicked sort of smile
tugging at her lips.  Jane had seen that look before on countless people’s
faces.  She had seen it in bars, and offices, and stores and anywhere where
people were.  She knew what lay behind that look, she knew what that look
was.  It was passion.</p>

<p>Jane was broken out of her revere by the sound of pulsing music—apparently
that’s what Brooke had been doing in front of the stereo while Sam ogled
her.  Concentrating on the scene in front of her once again, she saw Brooke
swaying to the beat casually, the movement almost seeming unconscious,
although Jane had no way of telling if it actually was unconscious or just
the style of the day.  Still sashaying, in a way that Jane couldn’t
characterize as asexual—even though she desperately wanted to—Brooke made
her way over to Sam, and flopped down on the couch beside her.  From that
position she slid over so that she was practically sitting in Sam’s lap and
flipped through the pages of the notebook Sam had been writing in, making
some comment that caused Sam to reach out and slap her gently, to which
Brooke merely smiled and continued with her page flipping.</p>

<p>As Jane watched she could see that Brooke was talking, but she doubted that
her daughter had anymore of an idea what the blonde was saying than she
herself did.  In the intimate position that they were in, it seemed to Jane
as if Sam was concentrating mostly on not leaning into the cheerleader.  She
could see Sam’s body sometimes rock towards Brooke as the blonde spoke, then
move away again, as if she were afraid of getting too close.</p>

<p>This was all too much for her and Jane leaned back against the wall and
closed her eyes, breathing deeply.  Things were starting to make sense to
her now, in a completely surrealistic way that was.  The girls new found
friendship, suddenly beginning to become understandable.  Jane was now
reasonably certain that Sam was subtly—maybe even unconsciously—trying to
court the blonde.  She figured that when Sam realized she was attracted to
Brooke—a fact that was now painfully clear to Jane—she must have begun to
act differently around her, the origins of her hostility having been
recognized.  This probably led them to spend quality time together, as they
did have the house all to themselves when she and Mike were away, and
unknowingly Brooke must have been going along with it, oblivious to Sam’s
real feelings for her.</p>

<p>Jane resisted to urge to bang her head against the wall knowing that it
would draw some unwanted attention to herself, and that it would stop a
brain that was barely functioning from functioning at all—and quite frankly
she needed in brain in working order.  She needed to figure out what she was
going to do about the situation, the problem was there just weren’t any
books on how to deal with situations like the one she was dealing with.  How
did one go about talking to their daughter about said daughters ogling of
her soon to be step-sister?  And, once one did manage to have the talk how
did one then make sure that said ogling stopped?  These were questions Jane
just didn’t have the answers to.  These were questions Jane was beginning to
fear she would never find the answers to.  She loved her daughter, and would
support her she just wondered to anyone who was listening why on earth Sam
had to become infatuated with Brooke of all people.  Dear, sweet, oblivious
Brooke, Jane thought to herself with a sigh.  How was she suppose to handle
this???</p>

<p>Jane continued to consider this for a few more moments then decided that she
found the entire situation terribly perplexing and that she needed to lay
down.  The Cowardly Parent, she thought to herself as she walked up the
stairs.  Too bad she wasn't in Oz.</p>

<p>It was actually a good thing that Jane left to go lay down when she did,
because if she had stayed any longer she would have seen Sam playfully start
to move her hand underneath Brooke’s skirt, and she would have seen Brooke
only have heartedly slap it before giving in totally to Sam’s roaming hands,
and this would have given her a whole new set of problems to worry about.</p>
