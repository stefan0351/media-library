<!-- And It All Became So Clear \ Part 2 -->

<p>We headed to the library after Buffy and I rejoined Xander. Giles
always liked to get after-patrol reports and this time Buffy actually had something to
report. With everything that had happened over the past 24 hours or so I had neglected to
glean any real information about the attack from Buffy, so I was actually looking forward
to the meeting because I would get to hear all of the good stuff. Sometimes Buffy would
try to soften things up for me when recounting tales, avoid all the blood and guts and
what have you. I would tell her not to I know she still did it. She wouldn't do that with
Giles though so I knew I would hear the real thing.</p>

<p>The walk to the library was quiet. Buffy and I were each lost in our
thoughts and, presumably, Xander was wondering what was up with all the quiet. When we
arrived Giles was re-stocking the cage-o-weapons. I'm still not sure how he got away with
installing that thing. As we took our usual seats around the table he approached.</p>

<p>&quot;Good of you to make it,&quot; he said in greeting. It was his
repressed British way of saying 'what the hell took you so long'. After we all gave him
suitably chastised looks he continued, &quot;How did it go last night?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was trouble and it found me,&quot; Buffy said with a
sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;She was sliced and nearly diced,&quot; Xander chipped in. We
all gave him the look of shame and he was quite again.</p>

<p>&quot;When I was patrolling around the playground this vamp jumped
out from behind the teeter-totter. He had long hair and funky tattoo on his face, and the
clothes he was wearing, my God! He looked like the Miami sound machine exploded all
over&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Giles interrupted, trying to get her back on
topic.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry. So he jumped out from behind the totter and I was like
'GREAT!' So he comes at me like I'm meals on wheels or something and we tangle. Kick,
punch, block, jab, twirl, yada, yada, yada. So after a while of that he pulls out this
bigass knife, and I'm like 'fan-freaking-tastic'. So he starts slashing away and I'm
jumping around trying not to be ginsued. So this one time I didn't turn quick enough and
he cuts me on the side. So I was really pissed off by then and I was like 'That's so it'
and I kicked the knife out of his hand and staked him.&quot; She continued making a little
stabbing motion when she got to the staking part. &quot;I was kind of bleeding by then so
I headed over to Willow's because it was close by, and we stitched me all up. No
biggie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; Giles said. His brow was creased so you could
tell that he was thinking. &quot;What exactly did this tattoo look like?&quot; he asked
Buffy after a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;It's kind of hard to describe. It was over his right eye, and
was like a bunch of lines joining together,&quot; Buffy replied.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't be certain but that sounds familiar,&quot; Giles said
still wearing his thinking face.</p>

<p>&quot;To the book trolley?&quot; Xander guessed. Giles simply
nodded, and Buffy and I laughed.</p>

<p>We had been at it for a few hours and still nothing. We decided that
an extra pair of hands couldn't hurt and Xander was sent out to get Faith seeing as he was
the least research inclined out of all of us. Giles was in his office and Buffy was on the
upper level. I had just finished with my book so I headed up to where Buffy was.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you looking at,&quot; I asked, joining her.</p>

<p>&quot;Big, ugly, useless red book that won't fit on the shelf,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah volume twelve,&quot; I responded. I had had the pleasure of
dealing with that one before.</p>

<p>&quot;Find anything?&quot; she asked turning to face me.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides dust-balls?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Besides dust-balls,&quot; she confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Nope. You?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nada,&quot; she responded closing the book up. After trying to
put it on the shelf and watching it fall a couple times she shrugged and left it where it
was on the floor. &quot;How many books have you sped through so far?&quot; She asked
stepping over it.</p>

<p>&quot;Three,&quot; I responded waiting for the shocked response I
knew I was sure to get. Usually I would have gone through twice as many in the same amount
of time. She took a step so that she was standing directly in front of me and looked at
me, scrutinizing me from head to toe.</p>

<p>&quot;You look like Willow, and sound like Willow but&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've been having some trouble concentrating,&quot; I said
cutting her off. She laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I didn't have anything to do with that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually&#133;&quot; I started to say but I never got a chance
to finish. She pushed her lips against mine, and as seemed to be the norm our breathing
soon quickened as our tongues moved with each other hungrily. She moaned into my mouth and
I moved my hand up to the back of her neck bringing us closer to together.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; she said when we finally broke apart. &quot;I've
never&#133;it's not usually&#133;it doesn't&#133;&quot; She stopped speaking and just
looked up at me.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said smiling. &quot;Me either.&quot; I know
what she was trying to say because I felt the same. Never had I responded to a kiss the
way I responded to hers. So passionately, repeatedly. I was glad I wasn't the only one
feeling it, that she was as overwhelmed by it as I was.</p>

<p>&quot;It's&#133;&quot; She started to say but was interrupted by the
library doors opening. Quickly grabbing a book we moved out from behind the shelf. It was
Xander and Faith. Moving down to the lower level we dropped our books on the table and
waited for them to join us.</p>

<p>&quot;Heard you got gashed B, you okay?&quot; Faith asked looking
Buffy over. She was obviously trying to find the wound.</p>

<p>&quot;Better than he is,&quot; Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I see it?&quot; Faith asked. She sounded excited which
bugged me. Buffy could have been seriously hurt.</p>

<p>&quot;Morbid much?&quot; Buffy asked her.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on B,&quot; Faith implored. &quot;I'll show you mine if
you show me yours,&quot; she added with a grin.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep it,&quot; Buffy responded as she lifted up her tank top
enough for Faith to see it.</p>

<p>&quot;How many?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fifteen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not bad,&quot; Faith said clearly impressed.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you two going to arm wrestle next or can we get on with
it?&quot; I asked suddenly. Three pairs of startled eyes regarded me.</p>

<p>&quot;On with it,&quot; Buffy responded for all of them. Xander and
Faith then moved away to find books but Buffy stayed by me. Once they were out of earshot
she turned to me and raised her eyebrow in question.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; I said. She continued looking at me though,
obviously wanting a better answer. &quot;I guess I'm feeling sort of territorial,&quot; I
offered. She continued to stare at me for second before smiling and shaking her head.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess you are,&quot; she agreed. &quot;You don't have to
worry about Faith invading this territory though,&quot; she continued teasingly.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I need to worry about anyone else?&quot; I asked regretting
it the moment it came out of my mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;No. No you don't,&quot; Buffy said regarding me seriously.
&quot;I promise we'll talk about this soon, work it all out. But I want you to know I
meant what I said this morning.&quot; I nodded not really knowing what to say.</p>

<p>&quot;We should get back to the research thing,&quot; I said
gesturing vaguely towards the table. She nodded and moved over to seat where she had
dropped her book. I sat down beside her and a few minutes later we were joined by Xander
and Faith.</p>

<p>Surprising us all, it was Faith who put a halt to research fest '99
with a call of eureka. After having Buffy confirm that the guy in the book had the same
markings as the vamp she slayed we called Giles in. He took the book from Faith and looked
at it for a few seconds before taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. A gesture
which never meant anything good.</p>

<p>&quot;I was afraid of this,&quot; he said shortly there after.
Sometimes I hated being right.</p>

<p>&quot;What does it mean?&quot; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Approximately six hundred years ago there was a caste of
vampire who called themselves 'The Children of the Dark'. They were extremely powerful and
lethal. Their secret power lay in being able to force their opponents to re-live past
experiences. If at sometime in the past you happened to break your leg they could make you
re-live that pain in conjunction with others. They could kill without ever laying a hand
on someone, human and demon alike.&quot; Giles related pausing momentarily.</p>

<p>&quot;Fun,&quot; I interjected during the silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Finally a Slayer by the name of Paladar was able was able to
defeat the cast by challenging their leader on a spiritual plane. Paladar defeated the
master and the caste lost its power and were banished to an alternate dimension where they
were suppose to remain until the end of time,&quot; Giles continued, ignoring me.</p>

<p>&quot;Apparently being banished until the end of time doesn't mean
what it used to,&quot; Xander commented.</p>

<p>&quot;How'd they escape?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what do they want?&quot; It was Faith who asked this.</p>

<p>&quot;Their powers back I would imagine,&quot; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&quot;And how would they go about doing that?&quot; Buffy inquired.
Giles rubbed his eyes and shifted his position before responding.</p>

<p>&quot;By performing a ritual at one of their sacred grounds and
sacrificing then consuming the blood of a Slayer,&quot; Giles said. We were all silent as
we absorbed what he'd just told us.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know about you B, but I like my blood in my body. I
say we impale these guys and pronto,&quot; Faith declared, standing up and looking a Buffy
expectantly.</p>

<p>&quot;How many are there?&quot; Buffy asked Giles.</p>

<p>&quot;It's impossible to know for sure. I appreciate your
enthusiasm, Faith, but we don't have enough information to go slaying as of now. My advice
would be for you all to go home and get some rest,&quot; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe we should pair off. Buffy and Faith shouldn't be alone
if there's a price on their heads,&quot; Xander piped up moving closer to Buffy.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a good idea,&quot; Giles said slightly disconcerted
that it had come from Xander. &quot;Buffy and Willow you stay together. Xander you go with
Faith.&quot; Giles instructed.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I get stuck with dumb and dumber?&quot; Faith
complained as we made our way out of the library.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey your not exactly a prize petunia yourself,Elvira,&quot;
Xander shot back. Buffy sent me a look as we followed the bickering duo out and I had to
smile. Even though I wondered at the wisdom of sticking those two together, I had to admit
that I was glad because Buffy and I would finally have some time alone.</p>

<p>Since Buffy's house was closer to the school, we headed there once
we left the library. I left a message on my voice mail telling my parents where I was in
case they called, then I joined Buffy in the family room.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do they call it 'The Pretender'? I mean he's not really
pretending because he actually becomes a doctor or a firefighter or whatever,&quot; Buffy
asked once I entered the room.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess it sounds better than 'The Actualizer',&quot; I said
sitting down beside her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well it's either this guy or the weather network. And the
weather network in Sunnydale never has much to report. Sun, sun, sun, and more sun,&quot;
Buffy responded.</p>

<p>&quot;This guy,&quot; I said settling into the couch. Neither of us
new quite how to start the talk so the talk was delayed. When the show ended however we
turned to look at each other.</p>

<p>&quot;That Miss Parker's a bitch,&quot; Buffy commented.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, she reminds me of Cordelia,&quot; I added. We both
laughed at that before settling into an awkward silence.</p>

<p>&quot;I said we would talk and I meant it I really did, I
just&#133;I don't know where to start,&quot; Buffy admitted with a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; I said softly. &quot;Angel,&quot; I told her
after a moment. I decided that we could as well start with the big guns.</p>

<p>&quot;Angel,&quot; Buffy repeated, looking down at her hands.
&quot;Okay. It's over between Angel and I, it has been for a long time now. We were really
saying goodbye from the beginning.&quot; She started again, &quot;What we had at first, it
was good. I loved him, but there was always this distance between us, this palpable
distance. We could feel it. Slayer, vampire, Buffy, Angel, whatever the dynamic even when
things were good it just never had the feeling of&#133;rightness. But we wanted it to so
badly, neither of us liked the distance. I think that was one of the main reasons
we&#133;you know,&quot; she said. I did know. &quot;And you know how that turned out. When
he came back and I was hiding him I guess I was hoping that things could go back to the
way they were before, but it soon became apparent that they couldn't. The time he spent as
Angelus had changed me, how I perceived him, and us.&quot; She paused the looked up at me.
&quot;I care about him still, love him, but I'm not in love with him, and I haven't been
for quite some time. I love him like I do Xander, or Giles, that's all. That's all I think
it was meant to be,&quot; she continued, taking my hand in hers and bringing it up to her
heart. &quot;It would be an understatement to say that things have been crazy lately and I
don't know exactly when my feeling for you changed, but believe me when I tell you that I
love you and am as sure of that as I am that my name is Buffy Summers,&quot; she
concluded. After that I couldn't resist placing a soft kiss on her lips. Pulling away
Buffy looked at me. It was my turn. &quot;Oz.&quot; Was all she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Oz.&quot; I repeated. He was my one true regret in all of this
because I really did care about him. &quot;I care for him, maybe even love, but I'm not in
love with him. He makes me laugh and I like being around him but he doesn't make my knees
weak or my head swim. Only you do that. He doesn't make me feel whole. Only you do
that,&quot; I told her. There were all sorts of other things floating around in my head,
but what I said basically summed it all up.</p>

<p>We sat staring into one another's eyes for many long moments, both
caught up in an impossible yearning, aware of one another's desire, yet seemingly unable
to do anything about it. My eyes lowered to take in Buffy's slightly parted lips, as well
as the exquisite line of her throat. Finally I raised one hand to her cheek and stroked it
slowly with the backs of my fingers, smiling as Buffy tilted her head to meet my caress. I
cupped Buffy's face acutely aware of the warm breath on my hand as Buffy moved against me
gently. Shifting closer I raised my head feeling her warm breath now on my lips, Buffy's
eyes closing as we migrated towards each other.</p>

<p>Carefully, in the precarious fits and starts characteristic of a
first kiss, our lips brushed, exploring gently, softly, repeatedly. We kissed sweet,
lingering kisses, tasting one another, consuming each other gently, cautiously. Buffy
pulled away briefly to stare into my eyes, her own stare darkened to a deep blue. Her hand
came to my cheek mirroring my hand on hers and we kissed deeply again, more passionately,
Buffy's breath coming in trembling sighs as I tugged gently, her tongue moving delicately
over my lips, tempting me, seducing me with warm breath and soft lips, quiet moans of
desire.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you,&quot; Buffy moaned into my mouth. I kissed her
fully, leaning forward to lay her back onto the cushions of the couch as my arm slid
across her shoulders to hold her tightly. I could taste her need, could hear the beautiful
soft sounds of pleasure that spilled into my mouth as she pulled me closer as our kiss
deepened further.</p>

<p>Buffy moaned and moved to kiss me over the spot just above the
juncture of my neck and shoulder. I groaned softly in response, almost a growl, and then
Buffy was pulling me up, nipping at my bottom lip playfully, smiling. She managed to shift
us so that she could stand, then held out her hand to me. Standing there, in front of the
couch Buffy kissed me deeply again before she pulled away and led me unprotesting up the
stairs and to her bedroom.</p>

<p>We stood at the foot of the bed, the starlight coming through the
window the only source of illumination as Buffy slowly revealed her body to me. I could
only stand mesmerized and stare as she undressed herself, smiling all the while. I watched
intently as she lifted her tank top up over her head, the muscles of her arms unmistakably
defined in the starlight. Then her hands slid up her stomach, and her bra was unclasped
and fell to the floor. She looked into my eyes, her lips curved upward in an utterly
sensuous smile as her hands moved to her waistband, pushing her pants and underpants down
her hips allowing them to fall to the floor, straightening and running her hands through
her hair as she stepped out of them.</p>

<p>Then she was naked, her body the most delicate porcelain I had ever
seen, just as I had imagined; slim and soft, perfect in its lines, unique and graceful and
so very beautiful. For long moments I simply gazed at the long, graceful lines of her
body. She moved toward me then, her hands reaching out and sliding beneath my shirt
pulling it up and over my head. Soon my bra, skirt, and underwear joined the rapidly
growing pile of clothes on the floor. Then I too was naked open to Buffy's heated gaze as
she inspected me slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow&#133;&quot; She whispered softly. Then she moved so
that we were together and we gasped as our skin touched for the first time, pressing into
one another, our lips meeting again and again in increasingly hungry kisses. Buffy's hands
were warm and gentle, her fingertips tracing the line of my jaw and the curve of my
throat, sliding over my body with quiet determination. I buried my face in her neck,
seeking out and finding her pulse point sucking on it gently.</p>

<p>Then it happened. The unimaginable. The catastrophic. The phone
rang, and rang and rang, and rang until finally, regretfully Buffy let go of me moved to
pick it up.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; she demanded irritably. I almost felt sorry for
the person on the other line, what with having to deal with a very horny, very pissed off
vampire Slayer. Almost. &quot;Xander? Is that you?&quot; she asked. Her expression changed
to one of concern. &quot;Slow down I can't understand what you're saying,&quot; she said
into the receiver. &quot;Alright, alright. Stay put we'll be there as soon as we
can,&quot; she said. &quot;No, just stay where you are, we'll get Giles. Okay&#133;it's
not your fault&#133;believe me&#133;okay&#133;be careful,&quot; she said then hung up the
phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Trouble?&quot; I asked already reaching for my clothes, while
cursing the unpredictability of my life, and the just wrongness of this interruption. I'd
already waited two plus years. This was just&#133;mean.</p>

<p>&quot;They've got Faith. Xander's at the motel now,&quot; she told
me, reaching for her clothes as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Is he okay?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;They whacked him over the head. He'll probably have a killer
headache but he'll live,&quot; Buffy said now fully dressed and moving over to the side of
her bed to pull out the trunk-o-fun. Knowing the drill I grabbed her bag and handed it to
her so she could start to load it up. &quot;Call Giles and tell him what's up while I
finish here?&quot; she asked, shoving a few stakes into the bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said moving over to the phone. I talked to Giles
while Buffy finished packing the bag. &quot;He's going to pick us up. He should be here in
a few,&quot; I said when Buffy moved over towards me. She nodded and together we headed
out the door to wait in the foyer.</p>

<p>&quot;Will&#133;&quot; she started once we were down there. There
was a look of deep regret in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I know.&quot; I told her with a gentle smile though my body
was tingling, crying out for her touch. &quot;Duty calls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said taking my hand in her free one and
squeezing it.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be.&quot; I told her. &quot;Somebody's got to save to
world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't doom and death have waited for an hour?&quot; She
asked, with a slight smile.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess they have a schedule to maintain. Besides we've got
plenty of time for&#133;things,&quot; I volunteered. She smiled that sweet smile that
always broke my heart then looked through the peephole.</p>

<p>&quot;The cavalry has arrived. Let's jet,&quot; she said a moment
later. I followed her out the door. Another day, another demon.</p>
