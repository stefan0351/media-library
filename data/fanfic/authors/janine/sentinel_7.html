<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 7 -->

<p>I don't remember exactly when it was that we stopped making excuses  to touch each other, both to each other and ourselves, only that  somewhere along the way a silent accord had been reached.  If I were  passing Brooke in the kitchen in the narrow space between the counter  and the island I would place my hand lightly on her hips as I greeted  her before brushing by, and while we watched TV I would sit on the  floor in-between her legs as she absently played with my hair,  stroking my shoulder to get my attention and point something out.   And almost every night one of us would sneak into the others bedroom  and stay for at least a few hours if not the whole night.</p>

<p>About a week after Brooke joined me in my bed for the first time my  nightmares stopped.  There was still the odd moment where I would  become momentarily seized by terror at the thought of what could have  happened, what did happen, but for the most part I was once again  living in a very happy present.</p>

<p>A giggle broke me out of my revere and drew my attention to the other  side of the room.  Brooke was holding McKenzie in the air flying her  around like a chubby little airplane much to the child's delight.   Every once a while Brooke would make McKenzie swoop down so that she  came to rest on her knee where she would tickle her stomach before  picking her up again so that they could continue with their aerial  display.</p>

<p>"Brooke dear," I heard my mother say from her spot on the couch next  to Mike.  "You're going to make her air sick."</p>

<p>"Nah uh," Brooke responded nonetheless stopping her motions.  "She  likes it.  Don't you like it little Mac?" she went on in a baby  voice.  "It's a bird, it's a plane it's Captain Little Mac," she went  on as McKenzie started to squirm and gurgle happily.</p>

<p>"As long as you're willing to be her airsick bag," was my mom's  somewhat amused response.  Brooke stuck out her tongue momentarily  then returned to McKenzie.</p>

<p>I turned away and stood up leaving the room a few moments later.  I  was sure that had I been exposed to a few more moments of the  unbearably precious display taking place in front of me that I would  lose what ever solid material was left in my body to the mush Brooke  was producing. </p>

<p>In fact, the effects Brooke had been producing in me had been  weighing on my mind heavy for the past little while.  The fact that I  was attracted to Brooke, strongly attracted and not just in a  physical way, hadn't been in question for quite sometime, it was just  that with our increasing closeness it was getting harder and harder  for me to ignore the feelings Brooke was producing in me, it was  getting harder and harder for me to want to ignore the feelings, and  it was starting to seep through into my every day life.  I would  sometimes find myself just staring at her lips wondering what they  tasted like, or running my fingers along the soft skin of her hand,  or her arm, in wonder at the sheer beauty of it.  And those nights  where my bed was I my own I would find Brooke with me in my dreams  doing terribly wonderful things to body only to wake up finding that  I had done it to myself and really enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p>I could hear Brooke coming down the hallway before I actually saw her  appear at my doorframe.  Smiling at me she gave a little rap at the  door and I made a big production about thinking about letting her in  before I solemnly nodded giving her permission to enter.</p>

<p>"Mac was starting to look a little green around the gills so I gave  her back to the parentals," she said as she walked into the room  closing the door behind her.  </p>

<p>I was lying on the bed with my legs hanging over its edge starring up  at the ceiling, and when I didn't verbally respond to her Brooke came  over and settled herself beside me, making the bed shake lightly.  I  remained quiet as she maneuvered herself so that she was flat on her  back almost mimicking my position except for a slight allowance made  for her leg.</p>

<p>`What's wrong?" she asked turning her head so that she was staring at  the side of my face.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I responded keeping my eyes on my ceiling.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," she said lifting her head up and tilting it to  the side so that it came to rest on my shoulder.  "I think  something's been bothering you for a while, and you're going to tell  me what it is."</p>

<p>"It's not that simple," I responded refusing to turn around and face  Brooke.  I still hadn't decided what I was going to go about the  situation, and I didn't want to face Brooke with indecision in my  eyes.  When I turned to face her, one way or the other I had to be  certain about what I was going to do.</p>

<p>"The important stuff usually isn't," Brooke responded softly.  "I  want to help Sam, whatever it is," she went on lifting her head off  of my shoulder and bracing it on her hand so that so that she was  looking down at me.  "I care about you, I don't want to see you in  pain," she continued stretching her free hand out as if she was going  to stroke my face but pulling it back before she actually made  contact.</p>

<p>"Brooke, believe me when I say that you really don't want to know  what's bothering me," I said, my voice coming out a half sigh.</p>

<p>"Sam, believe me when I say I really, really do want to know," was  her counter.  "And that I'm not going to stop bothering you until you  tell me or push me down a flight of stairs."</p>

<p>"That's not funny," I said not at all amused by the idea of more  bodily harm coming to her.</p>

<p>"It wasn't meant to be, it was suppose to show my dedication to  helping you even at high personal cost," she responded calmly.</p>

<p>I stayed in the position I was in for a moment more, and then I  flipped onto my side so that I was mirroring Brooke's position.  I  watched her carefully, allowing my eyes to wander all around her  face, the down the elegant lines of her throat, down to the swell of  her breasts, and further still to the graceful curves of her hips,  down her long tapered legs before settling on her cute little toes,  finally drawing my eyes back up to her face.</p>

<p>"I…Brooke," I said shaking my head.  "Look, just know that…that I  never meant any harm."</p>

<p>"Harm by what?" she asked her eyes searching mine.</p>

<p>"By anything," I said and then I moved forward without any further  hesitation and brought my lips to hers, brushing them lightly along  hers before pulling back.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" Brooke asked her lips curling slightly.  "That's what  was bothering you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you understand…" I started to say, but she reached out  and placed a finger over my lips gently `sssshhhhing' me.</p>

<p>"I think I do," she whispered taking her finger away from my  lips.  "Perfectly."  And with that she leaned forward and pressed her  lips to mine, the contact firmer and far more delicious than with the  almost educational kiss I had just given her.  I leaned into her  increasing the contact between us and as I did I felt her hand snake  around to the back of my neck holding my head in place as she  attacked my lips.  Feeling her tongue gently running along my lower  lip I parted my lips allowing her further access to my mouth.</p>

<p>Her hand came to rest on my hips as we continued to explore each  others mouths fiercely, her hand trailing up my side, softly brushing  across the side of my breast on its way back up to my neck, causing  me to gasp into her mouth arching towards her.</p>

<p>"Okay," I exhaled pulling my lips away from hers, "maybe you do  understand," I continued, my lips curving up into a full-fledged  smile which she returned.</p>

<p>"If it's okay with you," she said reaching out and this time actually  stroking my cheek.  "I'd like to understand a little more."</p>

<p>I dipped my head and scooted closer to her so that we were now  practically lying breast to breast then looked up at her  playfully.  "Let's learn about each other, baby," I said bringing our  lips together once more.  "Yeah."</p>
