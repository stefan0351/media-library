<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 2 -->

<p>"Sam?" Harrison asked snapping his fingers in front of the girls face.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah," Sam said returning to the real world.  She had been staring at
Brooke from across the lunchroom for the better part of fifteen minutes,
only stopping momentarily to pick up the container of salt she had knocked
over when Brooke flipped her hair which consequently turned Sam into a pile
of boneless mush that in turn flopped around and knocked the salt shaker
over.  "I heard you," she went on even though she had no idea what he was
talking about.</p>

<p>"So it's a deal then.  Next time you go on one of your anti-Brooke campaigns
I get a front row seat and backstage pass?" he asked confirming what he had
said earlier.</p>

<p>"Anti-Brooke?  Since when are you anti-Brooke?" Sam asked.  Now that Brooke
had been mentioned Harrison had her full attention.  Unfortunately for him
it seem there was no more anti-Brooke in Sam, if he was going to anti he
would have to anti himself.</p>

<p>"He's mad at her," Lily responded trying to smoother a smile as she mentally
re-called the display she had witnessed earlier.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He was talking to her today between first and second period and halfway
through the conversation she snapped at him," Carmyn started excitedly.</p>

<p>"Then he bitched back at her! Then after a minute of that..." Lily continued.</p>

<p>"Brooke ended up calling him J.C. and asked where Justin and Lance were,"
Carm finished trying unsuccessfully not to laugh out loud.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha, ha.  That's really funny," Harrison remarked dryly as he shot the
two of them deadly looks.  When he noticed the small smile on Sam's face he
observed her keenly for a moment before speaking.  "What did you do to her?"
he asked accusingly.</p>

<p>"Me?  Do?  To her?" Sam asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you've been acting like the energizer bunny for the past couple of
days while she's descended into the deep pits of Hades to emerge Princess
Bitch-a-lot, sister and right hand to Satan," he replied accusingly.</p>

<p>"Listen, I haven't done anything to her," Sam responded more soberly.
"Maybe YOU just need to brush up on your social skills a bit," she continued
somewhat antagonistically.  It was one thing for her to have previously made
Brooke's life a virtual hell on earth, but nobody else had better try it or
she'd be forced to non-violently kick one hundred percent of their ass.</p>
