<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 43 -->

<p>Nicole looked to side, observing Brooke out the corner of her eye.
She and the taller blonde had been stalking through the hallways for
almost fifteen minutes, but they had ended up nowhere.  Brooke was
walking, but Nicole was certain that she didn't have any idea where
she was going, and she was pretty sure that she didn't give a good
god damn about it either.  She was walking because she needed to
move, because if she stayed still, she would be forced to think and
she was forced to think, she might just have a mental breakdown.</p>

<p>"Everything's falling apart," Brooke mumbled softly as they passed
their lockers for the third time.  Thoughts of her rapidly
deteriorating family environment were haunting her, silences and
reproachful looks running through her brain over and over again,
taunting her.</p>

<p>"You didn't need to be a close acquaintance of Dionne Warwick to
predict that," Nicole responded.  Brooke looked off into the distance
moodily only regaining her focus when she heard her name being called
from somewhere just in front of her.</p>

<p>"Hey Brooke," Randy Dunn called from his position against his locker
door.  "Ellen called she wants her shtick back!" he continued smiling
at his own wit.</p>

<p>"Hey Randy, Rick James called he wants his hair-cut back!" Brooke
responded in a clipped tone.  She wasn't in the mood to trade barbs
with some insecure asshole at the moment.</p>

<p>"Dyke," Randy shot back.  He liked his hair, and it was all he could
think of.</p>

<p>"Was that you or your baby dick talking?  I couldn't hear over the
shrill cries of overcompensation," Brooke replied dryly, a small but
suitably malicious smile working its way across her face as the
people in the hallway around them chuckled at her comment.</p>

<p>"Bitch," Randy spat at her.  How did she know?</p>

<p>"Don't talk about your mamma that way," Brooke responded continuing
down the hall effective ending the conversation the undisputed
winner.  She hated to have a battle of the wits with someone so
poorly armed, but a girl had to do what a girl had to do.  The truth
was she felt slightly better after ripping him a new asshole.  As
they continued to walk down the hall she wondered if Nicole had been
onto something all these years.</p>

<p>Sam rubbed at her eyes tiredly for what seemed like the billionth
time that morning.  "You don't understand.  I got up to go to the
washroom and it was like the Salem witch hunts."</p>

<p>"Can you really blame her?  She's got to be paranoid.  You and Brooke
have been sneaking around with amazing proficiency for almost two
months," Carmen responded.</p>

<p>"All I wanted was some water," Sam replied pouting.  "Besides I'm not
an idiot, like I was really going to sneak into her the room the
night they found out!" she continued indignantly.  "I'm rather fond
of this little thing called life."</p>

<p>"Despite the suspicion you've got it pretty good," Lily
commented.  "From what you said, it sounded like they handled
everything exceptionally well."</p>

<p>"I know," Sam admitted grudgingly.  "It's just that now everything's
so tense.  Breakfast was nightmare, I was afraid to pass her the
milk.  And Mr. McQueen, you should have seen how he was looking at
me.  Suddenly I could identify most excruciatingly with the
saying `if looks could kill'" </p>

<p>"Well, you are banging his daughter.  Parents, especially fathers
tend to get upset when people bang their daughters.  In fact daughter
banging is…" Carmen responded not quite able to hide her smile.</p>

<p>"Can you pretend like this isn't a supreme source of amusement?" Sam
asked interrupting her friends diatribe irritably.  Most of them time
she dealt with Carmen's teasing well, she knew that the girl meant
well, but there was a time and place for it and this wasn't it.  "On
the outside this might seem funny, but inside it's really, really
sad," she continued wretchedly.  "Did I tell you they're making us go
to a family therapist!?!"</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound like such a bad idea," Carmen commented
objectively.  "You know, as long as you get to hit each other with
multi-coloured `take that bitch' padded bats," she continued making a
whacking action with her arm.</p>

<p>"Yeah, those aren't so bad," Sam admitted before frowning again.</p>
