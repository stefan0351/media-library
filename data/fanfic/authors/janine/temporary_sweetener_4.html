<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 3 -->

<p>"Does she do this a lot?" Cordelia asked looking over a Dawn.  Willow  was sitting in the middle of the floor, hovering above the ground  slightly with her eyes closed and her hair whipping around like she  was surrounded by her own private funnel cloud.  "Because it has an  extremely high creep factor."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," the younger brunette responded.  "Mostly we try and  ignore it, which is surprising easy…you know as long as things don't  start flying at your head … and the Emus stay away."</p>

<p>"Well I personally miss Fred's gadget's and I hate Fred's gadgets,"  Cordelia muttered to herself.  There was just something very off- putting about the entire display and she'd be glad when it was over.</p>

<p>"Who's Fred?" Dawn asked starting to get the ignoring and denial off  to a start.</p>

<p>"She's like Professor Peabody, only from Texas," Cordelia responded  shaking her head.  "She followed us home from another dimension and  despite my warning Angel insisted on feeding her…and well the rest as  they say is…"</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Willow called out her eyes opening wide exposing her  darkened pupils to the occupants of the room.  "Something new is  town.  I think it's Cordy's demon."</p>

<p>"It's not my demon, I didn't even get a good look at it.  It's  everybody's demon really," the ex-cheerleader interjected but nobody  seemed to paying attention to her besides Dawn who seemed to feel as  if being ignored brought them closer together in some way.</p>

<p>"It's stalking a group of kids out by Chatterley Park," the redhead  continued turning to face the blonde.  "I don't think that it's  planning on asking them for directions."</p>

<p>"Kids in trouble," Buffy muttered standing up.  "It must be a  weekday," she continued heading for the door.  "Come on," she said  turning around to face Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I don't fight the monsters, I just tell people where they are," the  brunette responded.</p>

<p>"I need you to tell me is this is the thing you saw in your vision,"  Buffy responded flatly.  "Besides, you said you were there so  obviously I'm going to convince you to come sooner or later, so you  could as well just save my vocal chords the strain and grab your  coat."</p>

<p>"Well when you put it like that," Cordelia started, "I really just  want to hit you," she continued walking towards the hallway  nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Works for me," the Slayer responded picking up her own coat.  "Shall  we."</p>

<hr>

<p>"What the hell were a bunch of kids doing out here anyway?" Cordelia  asked as they exited the park.  They had found evidence that a group  of people had been there recently but there was no sign of them  now.  "There's nothing to do out here.  They didn't build a Wal-Mart  around here did they?"</p>

<p>"No Wal-Mart," Buffy responded smiling though she was somewhat  distracted looking for any clues that would indicate the direction  the kids had taken off in.  "But there is an abandoned house about a  mile away that backs into the woods," Buffy continued her voice  slowing as an idea started to form in her mind.</p>

<p>"You think?" Cordelia asked looking over at Buffy.</p>

<p>"The mushrooms," Buffy said looking behind at the park remembering  the pieces of mushroom they had found scattered around the bench.</p>

<p>"This town really, REALLY needs a community center," the brunette  replied making a face.  "So we follow the shrumes?"</p>

<p>"Could as well," Buffy replied shrugging.  "I don't have any better  ideas."</p>

<hr>

<p>Cordelia dodged to the side as the trashcan lid went flying by her  head.  Turning back around quickly she looked at the terrified kids  frozen in front of her.  "GO!" she yelled waving her hands towards  the end of the alleyway.  However, all this seemed to so was cause  them to blink and stare at her blankly.  "GO!" Cordelia yelled  again.  "Run.  Away.  Flee!" she continued beginning to push them in  the correct direction.  "Fly away little birdies."</p>

<p>Sighing in relief when she saw them finally begin to take off she  turned around to find Buffy.  They had been on their way to the  house, when they'd heard a muffled scream come from one of the side  streets.  Needless to say, one thing led to another and once again  they were in a potentially lethal situation.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" the brunette yelled as the creature threw the blonde against  a nearby brick wall, and Buffy slid down bonelessly.  "Good one  Cordy," the brunette muttered to herself as the beast turned its  attention towards her at the sound of her voice.  "Next time you  should wear a t-shirt that say's `kill me' and avoid all the  confusion."</p>

<p>However before she could beret herself anymore she suddenly felt  herself being squeezed about the torso and hoisted into the air.   Kicking out with her legs she could feel her feet coming into contact  with the creatures flesh but it didn't seem to phase it.  Using her  hands to try and pry the creatures hand loose also seemed to be  having zero effect, so while her insides were still inside Cordelia  cast her gaze beyond the beasts hulky form where she spotted Buffy  once again on her feet.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Cordelia called out in a voice she was proud to admit was  panicked.  "Buffy!" she yelled again when the girl didn't move.  She  could see them, Cordelia was sure of it, she was looking directly  into the Slayer's face, but it was like nobody was home.  Buffy was  just staring without seeing.  Cordelia started to struggle harder,  but it was getting increasingly difficult as the creature tightened  its hold on her.  She was having trouble breathing.  "BUFFY!" she  yelled again.</p>

<p>Cordelia was about to yell out once more, but she found that her view  of the Slayer was quickly becoming impeded.  Focusing on the beast in  front of her, her mouth opened soundlessly in horror.  It had just  detached its jaw, opening up its mouth so that it was now big enough  to…   "BUFFY!" Cordelia yelled with a renewed vigor.  "BUFFY!!!" she  called again unable to see if the woman had begun to move or not.    And then she heard a sickening crunch and was falling to the ground  as the creature's hand released her.  And she was crouched down on  the ground gasping for air with a pained middle section watching as  Buffy raised a broken off piece of metal bar above her head and  slammed it down against the beast over and over and again, until it  stopped moving.  And then she was dragging herself into a standing  position as the Slayer grabbed a hold of the creatures' mangled body  and struggled to drop it into one of the alleys many dumpsters.</p>

<p>"Where were you!?!" Cordelia yelled  as Buffy turned away from the  dumpster to face her once again.  Her heart was still pumping wildly  in her chest and she was feeling decidedly uncivil at the moment.</p>

<p>"Here.  Saving your ass.  Just like old times," the Slayer responded  somewhat surprised by the anger in the other woman's voice.  What the  hell did she have to be angry about; she wasn't the one that had just  been used as a punching bag.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," Cordelia accused glaring at Buffy as she  began to pace.  Sure Buffy had been physical present the enter time,  but for a moment there she had disappeared, zoned out or something,  and in that moment Cordelia had nearly gotten her head bitten off!</p>

<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Buffy asked impatiently,  seriously beginning to become unimpressed by Cordelia's tone.   Perhaps if the brunette's visions hadn't been so lame she would have  been able to kill the thing faster.  You're breathing aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Barely," Cordelia shot back rubbing at her neck possessively while  staring at Buffy in a decidedly hostile manner.</p>

<p>Buffy stared at the other woman, expecting anger to overcome her at  any time as a result of Cordelia's gross ingratitude.  But the longer  she waited the more she came to realize that it wasn't going to  happen, and the wearier she became.  "I don't have to take this," the  Slayer stated softly but firmly, turning to leave the alleyway.</p>

<p>"Fine, run away.  Again, like always," Cordelia shot towards Buffy's  back.  She had seen this before from Buffy and more than a few times  from Angel.  These people were so strong, so gifted, so terrified of  themselves.  "You don't have to take anything do you, everyone else  just has to deal with it when you leave," she finished in a softer  tone, running a hand through her hair.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped moving as the woman's words reached her, halting her  where she stood.  "You think you know?  What I'm going through??" she  asked incredulously whipping around to face the brunette.  The  woman's audacity astounded her.</p>

<p>"I'm Cordelia, I don't think I know.  And I KNOW that you need to  snap the hell out of it!" Cordelia responded meeting the blonde's  increasing fiery gaze, realizing that this conversation had the  possibility of going horribly wrong…or perhaps wonderfully right.</p>

<p>"Snap out of it?" Buffy asked with a humorless bark of laughter.  "Do  I look like Cher!?!  I can't catchy quote my way out of this!" she  continued, yelling in the brunette's direction.  Ah, there was the  anger, she thought to herself.  Long time no see old friend.</p>

<p>"I see you," Cordelia responded standing her ground.  "I see what  you're doing, and it's going to get you killed.  Or one of them  killed.  You don't care, but you have to," she went on taking a step  towards Buffy.  "You can't just go through the motions, walk through  the part.  What's it going to take to get through to you, what's it  gonna take to penetrate your heart?  For god's sake Buffy, you're  alive!"</p>

<p>"And what if that's the problem!?!" the Slayer shot back  unthinkingly.  "What then oh great sage?  Tell me what to do.  Tell  me how I'm supposed to snap out of knowing I'm in hell!" </p>

<p>"This isn't hell Buffy, it's life," Cordelia responded somewhat  thrown and more than a little disturbed by the blonde's previous  statement.  Sometimes life could resemble hell, but they weren't the  same entity.  Buffy used to know that, and the fact that she had  ceased making the distinction worried Cordelia greatly.</p>

<p>"And that's supposed to make it better?" Buffy responded stepping  back from Cordelia and hanging her head down.  The anger was gone  leaving nothing in its wake.   "Fortune cookie wisdom," she muttered  under her breath.  "I was happy goddammit!" she continued spitting  out the words like they were ash in her mouth.  "For the first time  in as long as I can remember I was happy.  And now…" she trailed off  shaking her head dismally.  She ran her hand through her hair,  tugging at the strands forcefully pacing back and forth.</p>

<p>"You weren't in hell…" Cordelia practically choked out.  Like a wave  crashing over her, the truth of the situation came to her, chilling  her deeper than bone.  It was the only explanation, Buffy wasn't in  hell.</p>

<p>"I have to get back to Dawn," the Slayer said upon hearing the  brunette's response.  She couldn't do this, she had to leave.  She  needed to walk, she needed to find someplace quiet and just sit.</p>

<p>"You weren't in hell," Cordelia repeated, more firmly this time.  And  thinking about it she realized how ludicrous it had been to think  that Buffy had been.  Because if this girl, who sacrificed everything  she was, and everything she could have been for the people of the  world couldn't make it to the good place, then what chance did anyone  else have.  Buffy wasn't in hell, there was no way she could have  been, she's Buffy.</p>

<p>"I have to go," Buffy repeated.  She didn't want to think about, she  didn't to think about thinking about it.  She couldn't help thinking  about it, but she didn't want to think about it on purpose.</p>

<p>"Oh god.  Buffy," Cordelia whispered in a strangled voice as the  horror of the situation settled in her mind.  "You didn't want to  come back, they ripped you from…" and she let the sentence hang there  merely tilting her head up towards to the sky.</p>

<p>"I have to…" Buffy started again beginning to wake away from Cordelia  once more.  She couldn't say it, she couldn't talk about this.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Cordelia breathed out in a voice so pained that it was  almost inaudible.  She took a step towards the blonde, reaching out  for her and grasping her about the shoulder.  "You can't keep this  inside."</p>

<p>"They can never know," was all Buffy said in response.  She was  painfully aware of the weight of Cordelia's hand on her shoulder, of  the warmth.  She felt as if she was going to collapse from it.</p>

<p>"They have to know," Cordelia told her, moving around so that she was  standing in front of the Slayer, her hands still resting on the  woman's shoulder.  This silence, this play she was putting on for  them, it was helping to kill her.</p>

<p>"No!  They can never find out."  Buffy responded her body shaking  slightly.  "How?  How can I tell them?" she continued as tears  escaped from her eyes and her small frame continued to tremble.  "I  can't," she continued her voice quivering.  "How can I tell them that  I'd rather be dead?"</p>

<p>"You can't go on like this," Cordelia stated gently, placing her hand  on Buffy's check and stroking the skin of her cheek lightly as she  ducked her head down to get a better look at the blonde's face.</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy breathed out, her head tilting towards the hand  Cordelia had placed on her face.  "But…how do I make the pain go  away?"  she asked her voice helpless and beaten as the tears that had  been damned behind her eyes for weeks suddenly broke loose.  </p>

<p>Cordelia closed the last remaining distance between herself and Buffy  upon seeing the Slayer's breakdown, wrapping her petite blonde girl  in her arms.  She knew that she was the one that was trying to tell  Buffy that life didn't suck completely, but at the moment she wasn't  so sure about that.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Why do you superheroes think that you always have to be strong?"  Cordelia asked looking down at the Slayer as the blonde tried to  pulled out of her arms.  They had only remained standing for a little  while after she had brought Buffy into her arms, then gravity and  Slayer strength directed in a downwards direction had pulled them  down to the ground where they settled in a heap.  The truth was that  Cordelia wasn't against getting off of the filthy ground per say, she  just didn't think Buffy was trying to get up for the right reasons.</p>

<p>"Dawn," Buffy said, uncomfortably aware of the large wet patch on the  front of Cordelia's shirt, and of the fact that she was still nestled  in the other woman's arms and really didn't want to leave them.</p>

<p>"Dawn will be fine.  She's got three mommies, she's not going to miss  one for another couple minutes," the brunette related with a small  smile.  "Breathe Buffy.  Soak in the total lack of atmosphere."</p>

<p> "I have to…" Buffy started again, but was interrupted by Cordelia.</p>

<p>"You have to what?" Cordelia asked craning her neck around so that  she could see Buffy's face.  "What is it that you're going to do?"</p>

<p>Buffy met Cordelia's gaze for moment before turning away again.  What  was it that she had to do?  Where was she going to go?  Anywhere she  realized, she just had to move, she had to do something or else she  would go insane – if she hadn't already.</p>

<p>"I have to move.  I can't stay still," she told the brunette using  her strength to break the girl's hold on her this time.</p>

<p>"It's not all bad," the brunette said standing up as well.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked straightening her jacket as she prepared run far  away.</p>

<p>"The world," Cordelia responded dusting herself off.  What was it  with her and alleyways in Sunnydale?</p>

<p>"How can you of all people defend it?" Buffy asked momentarily  distracted from her plans of retreat.  "They wire the pain directly  into your brain.  All you see is hell."</p>

<p>"Not quite," Cordelia responded, her gaze on her boots.  "I've never  told them this, I've kept it too myself since the visions came to  me," she continued figuring that if she expected Buffy to bare her  soul, she should ante up as well.  "Sometimes, when I see things… they're not bad.  Most of the time it's blood and demons, and  sacrifice this, cut off that.  But sometimes, sometimes I'll see a  kid on a soccer field chasing down a ball.  Or a thirteen year old  getting their first kiss.  It's not all bad.  There's beauty, it's  just that people like us have to look a little harder for it.  That's  why we to do, so that other people won't have to."</p>

<p>"How am I suppose to find the answer when I don't even know the  question?" the blonde asked looking over at the brunette.  Sure their  little crying session had provided a bit of a catharsis, but there  was still the rest of her life to deal with.  She could hardly spend  her days crying on Cordelia's shirt. </p>

<p>"You know the question Buffy.  We all do," Cordelia told her shoving  her hands into her pockets.  "You've just been finding the answer  lacking."</p>

<p>"So how do I change that?" Buffy asked thinking Cordelia had just hit  the nail on the head.  "How do I change that it's not enough."</p>

<p>"Look harder," the brunette responded with a helpless little shrug.   What else could you do?</p>

<p>"When did this happen?" Buffy asked a moment later shaking her head.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"When did you become the voice of reason?" the blonde explained.</p>

<p>"September 31st, 1999 at 9:03 pm,"  Cordelia responded in perfectly  serious voice.  "It was a vindicating evening."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled shaking her head as they headed out of the alleyway.   She was actually glad to have Cordelia Chase back in town, the world  was a strange and unusual place.</p>
