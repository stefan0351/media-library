<!-- About a Girl \ Part 30 - Epilogue -->

<p>"Goodnight Tad," Katie said with a touch of exasperation as she
removed her head from where he had been holding it under his
arm.  "And," she said rushing down the steps, trying to smooth her
hair back down before he could grab her again, "as for the . ah,
stain.  Try baking soda," she continued grinning up at him before
Jessie grasped her hand leading her away from the house before he
could respond.</p>

<p>Despite the late hour it remained pleasantly warm outside as they
made their way through the darkened streets towards the Singer
residence, the faint voices of the other kids exiting Tad's house the
only sound around them as they walked the peaceful suburban streets.</p>

<p>"So," Katie started, her head tipping up to observe the stars above
them.  "What do you think is going to happen tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Jessie looked over at her, smiling softly before tilting her head up
as well.  "I have absolutely no idea," she breathed out, closing her
eyes as a warm breeze rushed past her.</p>

<p>"I know one thing," Katie said dropping her gaze down and turning her
head to look at Jessie.  "We," she continued, halting her movement
and spinning around so that she was standing just in front of
Jessie.  "Will be together," she went on softly, pirouetting Jessie
and then wrapping her arms around her waist.</p>

<p>"Then I know something too," Jessie replied, smiling as Katie pressed
a kiss into the crook of her neck, hugging them together in the
process.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Katie asked moving back beside Jessie so they could
continue their walk.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow's going to be a good day," Jessie replied glancing down at
their joined hands before looking back up at the road ahead of them,
a great smile settling across her features as she anxiously awaited
dawn.</p>
