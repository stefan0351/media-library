<!-- About a Girl \ Part 28 -->

<p><u><i>Manning House . Three weeks later</i></u></p>

<p>Jessie watched from her peeping spot just inside the kitchen door,
Katie shift around on the couch uncomfortably before finally coming
to a stop upon which she dubiously looked over to her side where Rick
was seated.  "I really don't know much about." she started to say,
trying to subtly worm her out of spending quality time with him, but
before she could finish she was interrupted.</p>

<p>"That's alright," Rick responded with a friendly smile.  "Just think,
this is the last time you're going to be able to say that," he
continued as the sportscasters began to speak and the golfers took to
the green.</p>

<p>Katie slumped back against the back of the couch, resigned to an
evening of bonding with Mr. Sammler.  For weeks before she had Jessie
had split he'd been trying to corner her and bond with her, and she'd
managed to avoid him but he caught her this evening.  Oh well, such
was the price of love.</p>

<p>"You have to make him stop," Jessie said with authority marching up
to Lily as she walked away from the door.  Lily, Grace and Zoë were
puttering around fixing dessert which was all well and good, but Lily
really had more important things to be doing, like getting her dad to
stop torturing her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Lily asked looking over at Jessie, wondering what had
the child so agitated this time.</p>

<p>"He's trying to tell her about 5 irons," Jessie responded clutching
at Lily's arm.  "She doesn't care about 5 irons.  NOBODY cares about
5 irons," she went on her arms waving wildly.  "You have to make him
stop," she finished pleadingly, doe like eyes gazing up at Lily
imploringly.  </p>

<p>"He's trying to bond with her," Lily replied smiling down at
Jessie.  "He's taking an interest.  That's sweet, isn't it?" she
asked wishing that her parents had tried to get along with the boys
she'd dated, instead of merely threatening them and then peeping
through the curtains to make sure no funny stuff was going on.  What
Rick was trying to do was much healthier.</p>

<p>"I think it's sweet," Grace piped in from over by the sink simply
because she knew it would piss Jessie off.  Because despite their
friendlier status, pissing off Jessie was still like one of the best
ways to spend her quality time, especially if she could get the girl
to gape.  Her guppy face was just priceless.</p>

<p>"Me too," Zoë agreed for no other reason than the fact that when she
agreed with Grace for no reason it bothered her sister immensely, and
that was always good for at least five or ten minutes of
entertainment.  </p>

<p>Jessie responded by glaring at both of them for a good ten seconds .
so that they realized that she was truly unimpressed with their
improve routine . and then returned her attention to Lily intending
to begin pleading again.  However, her glaring had apparently given
Grace enough time to find two more cents that she just simply had to
share with them all.  </p>

<p>"I mean it's not like they can talk about clothes and make-up," Grace
said smiling over at Jessie, crossing her mental fingers as she
waited for the guppy face, her smile fading into a shrug when Jessie
simply glared at her once more. </p>

<p>"Eli!" Jessie exclaimed happily, finally breaking eye contact with
Grace and flinging herself at her brother when he walked in the
door.  "You've gotta take dad somewhere," she continued disentangling
herself from around his neck.  "Shot hoops with him or something.
You've gotta get him out of the living room, Eli," she continued
grasping his hand and attempting to drag him into the living room.</p>

<p>"He's in there with Katie isn't he?" Eli asked looking at the rest of
the people assembled in the room, not budging despite Jessie's best
efforts.  They all nodded.  "Golf?" he asked.  Once again, a series
of solemn nods followed.  "Poor girl," he replied.  "I'll be in my
room."</p>

<p>"Eli!" Jessie whined.</p>

<p>"It's his way," Eli responded turning around.  "Jennifer had to watch
Monday night football with him, and Carla got the XFL.  This is what
it means to be a Sammler and have a girlfriend.  Deal with it," he
continued a smile spreading across his face as he finished.  He still
found it highly amusing that Jessie was dating a girl, a hot girl, a
hot older girl no less.  Then he turned back around and continued
merrily on his way.</p>

<p>Jessie glared at his back for a good twenty seconds, and then turned
back around and glared at the rest of the occupants of the room for
good measure, before finally returning to her peeping spot to see how
things were progressing in the other room.</p>

<p>"So the lower your number is, the better," Rick said pointing to the
spread at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie said in response, it was a simple enough concept to
grasp.  "But what's with the buggies?" </p>

<p>"They're not buggies," Rick replied looking over at the girl.

"They look like go-carts for senior citizens," Katie insisted meeting
his gaze, interested in the conversation for the first time since
she'd sat down.  She wasn't sure, but it looked like his eyes were
twitching.  It was kind of gross but also rather compelling.</p>

<p>"They're golf carts.  Not buggies, not go-carts.  Golf carts.  For
golfing," Rick replied straightening his back authoritatively while
trying to resist the urge to shake his finger at her to drive his
point home.</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie agreed once more.  "But what's the point of them?  I
thought this was a sport," she continued sarcastically.</p>

<p>"It is a sport," Rick replied gaping at her, astonished that she
would even imply that it wasn't.  It was lunacy, pure and simple.
Jessie was obviously dating a head case. </p>

<p>"Not much of a sport," Katie mumbled leaning back against the back of
the couch folding her arms across her chest.  "Basketball's a sport,"
she continued.  "Tennis is a sport.  Golf is like Sport's drunk
cousin that needs to be propped up to go to the bathroom," she
finished.</p>

<p>"Golf," Rick responded, "requires a great deal of skill and
precision," he continued defensively as he leaned back as well trying
to seem relaxed, but not at all succeeding.</p>

<p>"So does model building," Katie replied absently.  "It's not a sport."</p>

<p>"Well model building isn't on the sports network is it?" Rick asked
pointedly nodding at the screen.</p>

<p>"They play Magnum P.I. on A&E and that can't be considered either art
or entertainment," Katie responded while silently cursing the
eighties for its advocation of short-shorts for all.</p>

<p>"Golf is a sport," Rick replied somewhat militantly.  He liked Magnum
P.I.</p>

<p>"If you say so Mr. Sammler," Katie said conciliatorily.  She hated it
when old people got sulky.  It was just sad.</p>

<p>"I do," he responded, still not pleased that she seemed to be
humoring him instead of having actually seen the light.</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie said again, causing Rick to tense.  He was beginning
to dread the word `alright' when it came out of this girl's
mouth.  "What's with the eunuch?</p>

<p>"Eunuch?" Rick asked, wondering if he had been right about her being
on drugs.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you know the guy carrying the bag," Katie explained waving her
hand in the general direction of the screen.</p>

<p>"They're caddies, not eunuchs," Rick replied shooting her a
disgruntled look.  Katie smirked, so that's where Jessie got it from.</p>

<p>"Not much of a difference from where I'm sitting," she replied.</p>

<p>"They're a vital part of the game, invaluable to the golfers really,"
Rick tried to explain.</p>

<p>"Like the buggies?" Katie asked looking over at him.  Rick sighed, he
should have just let Zoë take her upstairs for a riveting game of Zoo
Tycoon, he really should have.</p>

<p>Jessie smiled and turned to head back into the kitchen.  She was
actually beginning to feel somewhat sorry for her dad.  He was
obviously way out of his league.</p>
