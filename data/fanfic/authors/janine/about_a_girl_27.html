<!-- About a Girl \ Part 27 -->

<p><u><i>Manning House . Later that Week</i></u></p>

<p>Lily sighed as she walked in the front door, happy to finally be home
after a long day.  Then just as she finished hanging up her jacket,
she heard a loud bang in the kitchen and looked over questioningly.
Things were quiet for a moment, and then she heard another sound and
pinched the bridge of her nose wondering what was going on before
finally heading towards the source of the disturbance.</p>

<p>Lily stopped dead in her tracks as she got her first good look at the
kitchen.  It looked like bomb had gone off, causing everything that
had been in the cupboards and fridge to explode outwards covering the
kitchen in heaps of everything.</p>

<p>"We're making dinner."  Lily looked up, the sound of Jessie's voice
snapping her out of her haze.  Following the sound of her voice she
saw Jessie grinning at her, while Katie nodded along gamely beside
her.</p>

<p>"It's a bit more complicated that `BAM!' though," Katie, added a
moment later shaking her head thoughtfully, before looking over at
Jessie, who promptly looked over at her, causing the two of them to
look at each other for a few seconds before breaking out laughing.</p>

<p>"That's nice," Lily, responded trying not to hyperventilate as she
surveyed the damage and tried to ignore the giggling girls.  "What're
you making?" she asked trying to accentuate the positive.  Jessie was
smiling, Katie was smiling, they were smiling, and smiling was
definitely preferable to glaring and temper tantrums.</p>

<p>"Pizza."</p>

<p>"Chicken."</p>

<p>Jessie and Katie then turned to look at each other in surprise,
staring hard at each other for a moment before turning back to Lily.</p>

<p>"Chicken pizza," they said simultaneously nodding at her as if to
indicate that they had it all under control.</p>

<p>Lily smiled and wandered out of the kitchen wondering if Zoë still
had her paper bag from lunch.</p>
