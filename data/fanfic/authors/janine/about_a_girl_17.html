<!-- About a Girl \ Part 17 -->

<p><i><u>Manning House – One week later</u></i></p>

<p>Jessie slowly crept down the hallway as quietly as she could, taking extra caution to be especially quiet as she passed by everyone's room on her way to the staircase. It was just past one in the morning and if she knew Katie the girl was already outside waiting for her. It had been a crazy week for both of them and they'd hardly been able to spend anytime together outside of school, and school didn't really count because they were never really alone or could never really relax. There was always someone passing by with something to say, or a class to run off to, so when Katie had suggested that they sneak out and watch the meteor shower that was predicted for that night, she had agreed almost without any hesitation. Almost, after all she was still her mother's daughter, and as such rule breaking always caused her some minor heart palpitations though they generally passed. </p>

<p>"Billie!" Katie whispered happily as Jessie opened the back door, flying into the kitchen and wrapping her arms around Jessie.</p>

<p>"Sssh," Jessie said putting her fingers on Katie's lips to quite her. "Eli," she continued having heard her brother moving around his room as she passed by the door to the garage. Katie nodded and drew two fingers across her lips making a tossing motion. Jessie smiled and leaned up kissing her quickly before grabbing her hand and leading her out the door, not stopping to look back.</p>

<p>Rick rubbed at his eyes tiredly barely avoiding banging into a wall as he stumbled into the kitchen. Using the counter to steady himself, he slowly made his way to the fridge, opening it up and taking out a pitcher of water. However, as he reached for a glass he felt a slight draft and turned around to look at the back door. Making his way around the counter he padded over to the door to see it slightly ajar. One of the kid's shoes, Zoë's from the size of it had caught in between the frame and door. He frowned to himself as he considered this, turning around slowly. He was the last one downstairs and he had locked the door himself before heading up to bed. Now, fully alert he reached above the stove grabbing a frying pan as he passed into the living room. Moving very carefully, he slowly checked all of the downstairs rooms then made his way upstairs.</p>

<p>Lowering the frying pan, he headed for the door to his bedroom. Nobody was in the house, which only meant one thing; one of the people who was suppose to be there was missing.</p>

<hr>

<p>"You're not serious, are you?" Jessie asked rolling over, so that her arms were braced on the sides of Katie's body and she was leaning over the other girl. Rumpling the blanket they were lying on along the way, but really not caring in the least.</p>

<p>"I am so," Katie responded with an exaggerated importance. "I mean really, think about it, it's the perfect topic for a history paper. A hearty tribute to a natural phenomenon that has benefited mankind from the beginning of time yet is constantly taken for granted. I can't be the only person that's tired of hearing everyone go on and on about electricity, and nuclear power, and the printing press. I think it's high time that somebody gave gravity its props. Said, `Hooray for Gravity' even. I plan to be that person."</p>

<p>"Hooray for Gravity?" Jessie questioned shaking her head slightly before lowering it down to rest on Katie's chest. "Why don't you just say that you're writing a commentary on consumer culture and call it `Snap in to a Slim Jim!'?" she continued derisively. Hooray for gravity, indeed.</p>

<p>"Snap in to a Slim Jim," Katie repeated thoughtfully as she wrapped her arms around Jessie's waist, tracing her back with small, careless circles. "You'd have to help me with that one though, it sounds a bit complicated," she went on with a smile.</p>

<p>"What happened to the meteor shower?" Jessie asked choosing not to dignify Katie's comment with a response.</p>

<p>"What meteor shower?" Katie asked as if Jessie had just asked her if she'd seen a talking dog walk by.</p>

<p>"The meteor shower you said we came out here to watch," Jessie replied raising her head up and looking at Katie keenly. "Oh my god," she said a moment later fixing her with a stern look that quickly dissolved into a grin. "You brought me out here to have your way with me."</p>

<p>Katie smirked, looking away guiltily before turning back to look up a Jessie. "Next time I'm going to have to produce a meteorological report from a reputable news source aren't I?" she asked smiling softly.</p>

<p>"Two," Jessie replied seriously, before leaning down to kiss Katie softly, pulling back a moment later with a dreamy smile on her face as she lay her head back down.</p>

<p>"So does this mean your not going to help me snap into a Slim Jim?" Katie asked, but before she could continue Jessie's lips were on hers, and she suddenly found much better things to do with her tongue.</p>

<hr>

<p>"The back door was open," Rick said as Lily pulled on her robe. "I know I locked it before I came up, and I checked the house and nobody was here. One of the kids has snuck out, it's the only explanation."</p>

<p>"Alright," Lily said her voice still blurry with sleep. "You go downstairs to see if Eli's there, and I'll check on Grace and Zoë, then we'll head up to the attic."</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me," Rick replied, thinking smugly that Grace was going to be in a lot of trouble when her mother found out she wasn't there.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey," Katie said softly, gently shaking Jessie's shoulder. The other girl had fallen asleep on her an hour ago, but she hadn't minded, in fact she'd loved just lying there getting to hold her while she was asleep. "We've gotta get back," she continued seeing Jessie blink up at her sleepily.</p>

<p>"What time is it?" Jessie asked lifting her head off of Katie and rolling onto the other side of the blanket.</p>

<p>"Almost five," Katie replied sitting up. She's felt like kicking herself when she'd checked her watch a minute ago, they'd planned on being back way before this. "I guess we lost track of the time."</p>

<hr>

<p>"That just leaves Jessie," Lily said meeting Rick at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the attic. She'd checked to find both Grace and Zoë sleeping soundly, and Rick had reported that Eli had actually been in his room for once, which meant that the youngest Sammler was the only one left to check on.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Sssssshhhhhhhh," Jessie whispered loudly as she pushed the door open and Katie grabbed her around the waist laughing. "Sssssh," she said again laughing herself now as Katie bit her lip in an exaggerated attempt to look like she was trying to be quiet. Jessie smiled up at her thinking that she had never seen a more adorable face in her life and leaned up pressing their lips together.</p>

<hr>

<p>Rick's hand twitched as he heard his daughter enter the house, telling whoever she was with to be quiet, then he lifted his hand and flicked on the lights to the kitchen half a tirade already out of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Where the hell have you be …" he said stopping as he got his first look at the scene in front of him. "…en?" he finished saying, his voice barely audible as he watched Jessie rip her lips off of Katie's as she twirled around to look at him and Lily.</p>

<p>Jessie opened her mouth to answer, still uncomfortably aware of the taste of Katie's mouth and proximity of her body, but no sound came out. Instead she merely stood there gaping at her father and Lily, her mind completely and utterly blank.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Maybe I should just take Katie home?" Lily suggested breaking the silence that had descended upon the kitchen the moment the lights had been turned on. It had been over a minute and nobody had said a thing since Rick stopped talking.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Go to your room," Rick said softly the moment the backdoor shut behind Lily and Katie.</p>

<p>"Dad," Jessie started carefully, but before she could get out anything more Rick interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Go. To. Your room, Jessie," Rick repeated his tone dull, but leaving no room for argument. This was not a request, it was an order and Jessie knew it. Sighing softly, Jessie dropped her head down and headed towards the stairs.</p>

<p>Hearing Jessie's feet dejectedly slumping up the stairs Rick took a deep breath, possibly his first since he turned on the light, and sighed running an agitated hand through his hair. He had not expected to see that. Not in a million years had he expected to see that. </p>

<p>Taking a few steps forward he dropped down onto the couch, bringing his hand up to his face, rubbing it over his features before allowing his hand to drop back into his lap. He had not expected to see that. Not in a million years had he expected to see that.</p>
