<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 5 -->

<p><i>*Sam's POV*</i></p>

<p><i>Three Weeks Later…</i></p>

<p>Brooke and I had always been at war: a war of the wits, war of the  worlds, and a war of the wills.  Now she had battle wounds.  She had  only been back home for a few days, and I had made it my job to take  care of her, to make sure that all of her needs and wants were met.   We were in her room, she was lying on her back on the bed and I was  kneeling on the floor.  My hand was on her leg gently trailing along  it.</p>

<p>"It really doesn't hurt?" I asked looking at the long, nasty gash on  her leg.  The stitches were still in it and looking at it I could  tell that it was going to scar.</p>

<p>"It itches sometimes," she said shifting so that she could see what I  was doing, "but it doesn't really hurt anymore."</p>

<p>I dipped my finger into the jar of ointment that sat by my knee,  bringing it up and spreading it along the wound.</p>

<p>"You don't have to do that anymore," she said softly.  "I can reach."</p>

<p>"Do…do you not want my help?" I asked looking up at her blinking.  I  knew that she didn't really need my help anymore that she could  function without me doing these little things now.  The thing was  that even if she didn't need it I did.  I had to feel like I was  helping, like I was doing something.  I wanted to help her.  </p>

<p>"Of course," she responded quickly looking a little surprised.  "I  just thought that maybe you didn't want…that you know you thought  that I still, but…I mean, it's nice, knowing you're there.  I mean…"   She stopped talking as I smiled up at her and shook her head  ruefully.  "I can't even blame it on the drugs anymore," she muttered  to herself as I finished up.</p>

<p>"I like you just fine sober," I said standing up.  "And the  stuttering is cute."</p>

<p>My last comment didn't get the sweet little smile I had come to  anticipate from comments like that.  Instead she looked at me rather  seriously, her eyes capturing mine as she studied me silently.  I  wondered what she was thinking, if my comment had upset her.  </p>

<p>"Sam," she asked softly.  "Why are you doing this?"</p>

<p>"Doing what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Everything," was her response.  "Why?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" I replied more hopeful that she would let it drop than  convinced that she actually would.</p>

<p>"That's not an answer," she said softly.  "I wasn't…I'm not  complaining.  I just was curious I guess," she went on.  Her eyes  dropped from mine as she spoke, taking up an intense study of her  sheet.  I could tell that she was thinking more than she had told me. </p>

<p>"Why?" I repeated.  "Why?" I said again shaking my head.  "You  couldn't have asked me something easy, like the meaning of life?" I  went on beginning to pace.</p>

<p>The truth was I hadn't really given much thought to why.  Certainly I  had asked myself but the answer I came up with had always been  because I needed to.  That I did it because it was something I felt I  should do, I had to do.  And I never questioned myself further than  that.  So the question became, how was I suppose to explain why I was  doing what I was doing to Brooke when I couldn't even explain it  myself. </p>

<p>"I'm going to be honest," I said stopping the cycle of pacing I had  begun moments before.  "I don't know why, just that I…just that  everything I've done felt like…I felt it inside, that…" I stopped  talking when I realized that I wasn't even making any sense to  myself.  "Ah hell Brooke, I don't know why.  Does it really matter?"</p>

<p>"No," she said looking over at with twinkling eyes.  "I guess not,"  she continued.</p>

<p>"You know I love you right?" I asked, surprising myself with the  sudden declaration.  Surprising Brooke too from the way she opened  and closed her mouth with no sound coming through.  "I know that  we've fought with each other like bitchy fags for pretty much all of  our lives, but that doesn't matter.  I mean, it's like part of our  dynamic, we piss each other off, we help each other out, but most  important of all we care about each other," I continued returning my  gaze to hers.  "You know that, right?"</p>

<p>"I know," she said holding me eyes.  "How could I not?  And just for  the record, I kinda love you too," she said turning a funny colour  red as the words came out of her mouth.</p>

<p>I smiled at the reaction and walked over to her sitting beside her on  the bed.</p>

<p>"I should probably get to bed," was what I said as I looked at my lap.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she agreed sounding a bit disappointed.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow's banana pancake day," I said looking over at her.  "The  sooner the sooner."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Goodnight then," I said standing up.</p>

<p>"Night," she replied looking up at me.</p>

<p>Then before I knew it, before I could even think about it I found  myself leaning down towards her, and then into her.  Before I had  time to process what it was I was doing I had brushed my lips against  hers lightly.  Then my brain caught up to my lips and I stepped back.</p>

<p>"I'll see you in the morning," I told her acting as if nothing had  just happened.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she responded.  "Sweet dreams," she added on at the end  almost as an afterthought.</p>

<p>As I made my through her door into the bathroom, making certain to  keep it open so that I could hear if she was in any distress during  the night, I thought that it was very unlikely that I would have any  dreams that could be described as sweet.  I hadn't had any sweet  dreams in quite sometime.  In fact, the only times I could remember  having decent nights sleeps were those days in the hospital when I  took Brooke up on her offer and we fell asleep in each others arms.</p>
