<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 41 -->

<p>Brooke tore her attention away from the hallway where she swore she
could hear voices.  She knew that Sam and Jane were fixing up the
guest room, she had been banned from helping but her father had
helped carry some of the heavier things across the hall.  When he had
finished about twenty minutes before, he had come to her room to talk
to her. </p>

<p>"It's been a dry heat really.  For me I think that's almost worse
then when the humidity's really high," Brooke stated philosophically
turning back to face her father.  They had been talking about the
weather since Mike had joined her.  Brooke was familiar with this
type of conversation, they always talked about the weather when Mike
wanted to talk to her about something but didn't know how to.  When
he had noticed her rapidly losing weight and not eating, they had
discussed that feeling you get before it rains, and when they talked
about her mother leaving, hurricane season had come up.</p>

<p>"Dry heat has always been the worse for me too," Mike
responded.  "There's just been no wind lately.  When there's a nice
breeze it can make up for the heat, but without it, well things just
aren't that pleasant," he continued with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"I heard a cold front is moving in from the north," Brooke
commented.  "That should cool things down a bit," she went on hoping
that things didn't too cold.  Despite the heat the cheerleading
uniform didn't really provide much protection, and the last thing
that Brooke wanted was to get a cold.  That would just be like lemon
juice in an open wound.</p>

<p>"Let's just hope it doesn't get too cold," Mike replied to
that.  "When it got really cold in March last year, I was never able
to get used to it, ruined my whole week.  This California climate's
ruined me," he continued.  Brooke nodded but didn't say anything.</p>

<p>They sat in silence, only turning momentarily when they heard raised
voices from across the hall once again.  Brooke looked out into the
hallway longingly.  Frankly, she wished that she and her dad could
just duke it out like it sounded like the McPherson women were
doing.  McQueen's, she had come to realize, didn't talk about
problems, they let them fester, and grow, and then when they couldn't
be ignored any longer, they had awkward conversations, where they
beat around the bush until they were too exhausted to actually talk
about what was wrong.  However, Brooke no longer felt like discussing
the latest news from the weather network, in fact it disturbed her
that she had watched the weather network before coming up to her room
because she knew what was going to happen.  She wanted to talk to her
father, she wanted him to yell at her, and emote and express his
feelings.  For once she wanted to have a normal fight.</p>

<p>"How come we can't do that?" Brooke asked finally waving her hand at
the door.  She sounded irritated, and she was.</p>

<p>"What?" Mike asked.</p>

<p>"Yell at each other," Brooke responded as if it was the most
reasonable thing in the world.  "That's what people do.  The teen
does something the parent doesn't like, the parent calls them on it,
the teen makes some sort of smart-ass remark, and then comes the
yelling," she continued gaining steam.  "That's normal.  This,
contemplation of the weather is not healthy.  I mean don't you have
anything to say?  I mean, I'm dating your fiancés daughter…doesn't
that just make you want to yell like you care about something?" she
finished in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>Mike shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  Of course he wanted to say
something, he had a myriad of thoughts, comments and questions about
the situation, he just didn't know how to go about voicing things.
People in his family avoided confrontation, it was how they had
managed to appear to be a happy family for generations.  You didn't
confront things, you ignored them and hoped they went away.  </p>

<p>"I don't know what to say Brooke," he responded finally, standing up
and beginning to pace the room.  "I mean," he threw his hands up in
the air and shook his head at her.  "I don't know what to say
Brooke," he repeated helplessly.</p>

<p>Brooke sighed and looked at the floor.  The cycle continued.</p>

<p>"I kissed her first," Brooke said finally.</p>

<p>"What?" Mike asked turning to face her.</p>

<p>"It started out as a bet, I had to kiss her to win it," Brooke went
on ignoring his question.  "I thought it would be easy, and it was,"
her voice was soft, almost awed, "I just never thought.  It was like
everything went into techno-colour.  But it was Sam, and I tried to
tell myself that I was having a mental situation, but it didn't feel
like a mental situation.  The only thing that felt wrong was denying
it.  And before I knew it, before I could even consider it and talk
myself out of it, I had gone from hating her loving her.  I love her,
I need her," she continued her a rush, the words pouring out of her
mouth without thought without hesitation.  When she finished speaking
she looked up meeting her fathers eyes.  Now all she had to do was
wait and see what he was going to do with the information she had
just given him.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you need.  You won't know what you need until
your forty and you don't have it," Mike responded dismissively,
somewhat unhinged by the flow of words and thoughts Brooke had just
unleashed upon him.</p>

<p>"I need her," Brooke repeated standing up and walking over to where
he father was.  "I love her," she continued somewhat
confrontationally.</p>

<p>"No you don't," he responded.  His voice was still calm, but Brooke
could tell that he was cracking under the pressure.  A little bit
more, and they would actually be having a conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," she said forcefully.  "She's the first and last thing I
think about every day," she continued not backing down.   "I've never
felt the way I do when I'm with her."</p>

<p>"In all your extensive experience, right?" Mike commented
sarcastically as he turned to face her.  "How do you know what you
want?  What you need?" he asked dubiously.  "You used to kiss your
Scott Baio poster every night and every morning, I suppose he's your
soul mate too! Come on Brooke, you're not even old enough to remember
who shot J.R.!" he continued.  </p>

<p>"Age ain't nothin' but a number," Brooke responded channeling Aaliyah
for a moment.  "We're older than Romeo and Juliet, nobody said they
weren't old enough to be in love, to know what love was and that it
was each other," she continued passionately.</p>

<p>"Why do people keep using that play as an example?" Mike asked
irritably.  "They died.  It was a damn TRAGEDY!"</p>

<p>"But this doesn't have to be," Brooke said pointing the doorway.  "We
don't have to be.  The situation sucks, I get that, but IT IS the
situation.  Whether you believe it or not Sam and I are in love with
each other, it's not rational, it's not convenient, and yeah, it's a
little bit awkward but that's how it is!" Brooke yelled at him.  "I'm
telling you right now that after all we've been through, nothing
short of death or expatriation is going to break us up!"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" Mike asked at a loss for what else to say.  The truth was
that the situation was harder for him to grasp because he could tell
that there was a genuine depth of emotion between the two girls.  If
it had just been about sex, or about rebellion, or about fashion, he
could have dealt with it, he could have put his foot down and
demanded that a stop be put to whatever was going on.  But now, there
was Brooke taking about love, talking about commitment, and
expatriation.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke responded somewhat confused by her fathers schoolyard
response but stepping up the challenge nonetheless.  </p>

<p>"Well…you're grounded!" Mike shot back immediately.  "So there."
Brooke gaped at him absolutely stunned.  She couldn't believe what
she was hearing.  Was she talking to her father or her six year old
cousin Russ?</p>

<p>"You can't do that!  Grounding out of antagonism is strictly
forbidden!" Brooke finally responded angrily.  She could feel tears
stinging her eyes and impatiently brought her hand up to her face to
rub them away.</p>

<p>After Brooke spoke, Mike observed her intently for a moment.  Her
eyes were misty as she rubbed at them, but she wasn't outright
crying.  Her body was trembling slightly, but her voice was strong.
Her tone was commanding, but her eyes pleading.  She was terrified
and was trying not to show it.   It was what she was terrified of
that caused him to pause.  She knew that he wasn't going to kick her
out of the house, that much had to be clear to her already.  She knew
there was no danger of physical violence.  So what could she possibly
have been so scared of?  After a few moments thought, what seemed
like a lifetime of contemplation, he was able to come up with only
one answer, that Brooke  was afraid that she would lose Sam.  </p>

<p>"I know I'm not old enough to drink, or vote, but can't you
understand that that doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy
world of ours," Brooke went on when he didn't say anything.  "You
love Jane.  I love Sam.  It's the same thing," she continued in a
rush.  "There's a certain symmetry to that, isn't there?"</p>

<p>Mike was distracted from responding, by the sound of footsteps in the
hallway.  Turning his head to the side he saw Jane exit the guest
bedroom.  She looked around for a moment then spotted him looking out
into the hallway from Brooke's room.  She motioned him out into the
hallway, and after muttering something to Brooke that sounded
like "we'll talk later" he followed Jane out into the hallway,
closing Brooke's door behind him.</p>

<p>Brooke slumped down into her chair as soon as the door closed and
sighed.  "That went well," she commented to herself, before chuckling
morosely and turning to look out the window.  It looked like rain.
She was right, there was a cold front coming.</p>
