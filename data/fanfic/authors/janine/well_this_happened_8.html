<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 8 -->

<p>Josh followed Nicole reluctantly to a fairly empty area of the school-one
that became completely empty after Nicole worked her unique brand of magic.
The blonde had sought him out after his last class and essentially ordered
him to follow her, and, like all people who knew her, he listened to her
because, quite frankly he was afraid.  It was a manly fear to be certain,
but it was fear nonetheless.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked somewhat reluctantly.  He was certain that whatever
she was about to say would end up causing some sort of problem in the near
future.</p>

<p>"It's about Brooke," Nicole started timidly which immediately put him on the
defensive.  "I'm worried about her," the blonde continued looking up at Josh
through her eye lashes coyly.</p>

<p>After their talk in the Novak Nicole had given some very serious thought to
the situation at hand.  Brooke was her friend, and really loyal like a puppy
when it came down it, because Brooke was essentially a good person.
Certainly she could be manipulated into doing things that went against her
instincts, but for the most part she was concerned with others feeling and
didn't want to hurt other people so that she herself could benefit.  This
contrast in Brooke was the reason she was the queen-bee, she could be nasty
when she needed to be, but was also essentially likeable.  Add to that the
fact that she was unquestionable beautiful and it all equaled immense
popularity.  This had served Nicole well over the years, but it was now time
to question the order of operation.</p>

<p>While Nicole herself had benefited greatly from Brooke's popularity by being
her best friend, she had also worked extremely hard to get where she was.
She had gone from being worse than a nobody to the girl everybody wanted to
be or at least feared.  She liked the upgrade and she wasn't willing to give
it up for the sake of Brooke's libido.  However, she did feel some sort of
obligation to her sister in arms which is why she wasn't content to simply
break ties with Brooke and destroy her.  She was going to offer the head
cheerleader a chance to redeem herself.  If Brooke accepted it, then so be
it, however if she denied the opportunity that was so graciously being
offered her Nicole wouldn't hesitate to take her down and step over the
corpse to take the crown.</p>

<p>"She seems fine to me...a little tense, but other than that," Josh responded
trailing off.  However, despite his answer he wondered if something really
was going on with Brooke.  Since they had broken up they hadn't spoken as
much as they used to, and especially lately Brooke had been keeping to
herself.</p>

<p>"I don't think that she's handled your break-up well at all," Nicole related
with a touch of sadness.  "I think it's really messed her up."</p>

<p>"She's the one that broke-up with me," Josh responded somewhat dismally.  It
was still a sore spot for him.</p>

<p>"I know," Nicole said soothingly, "but I think she just did it because she
was confused, and now she doesn't know what to do.  Sometimes I don't even
recognize her anymore, it's like she's made a complete 180.  Especially now
that..." she trailed off removing her eyes from Josh's and off to the side.</p>

<p>"Now that what?" Josh asked curiously.  He hadn't noticed that big a change
in Brooke, in fact she had seemed quite happy.</p>

<p>"It's just...it's as if she's decided that if she couldn't have you she was
going to give up on men altogether," Nicole said forcing a note of alarm
into her voice.</p>

<p>"Give up men?"</p>

<p>"I know, crazy but true," Nicole replied.  "I...I don't know if I should say
it...it's just sooo...oh I don't know," she said dragging him along.  She was
enjoying this.</p>

<p>"You can tell me, you know I love her," Josh said pleadingly.  He just had
to know what was wrong with her.  Even if they weren't going out anymore
they were still friends, at least he thought they were.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, how about a month ago Brooke was acting very anxious?"
Nicole asked as her mind raced trying to figure out how exactly she wanted
to drop the bomb.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Josh responded simply.</p>

<p>"Well, you know she and Sam were alone in the house at that time," Nicole
continued.  Josh simply nodded his agreement.  Brooke had talked to him
about how she was dreading being alone with Sam.  "Well, I think that she
may have turned to Sam for comfort, you know tried to bond with her," Nicole
went on.  "But I think Sam comforted her too much."</p>

<p>"I'm not following you," Josh replied.  If Brooke and Sam were getting
along-which they seemed to be doing-that was a good thing, or at least he
thought it was.</p>

<p>"They became engaged," Nicole started carefully.  "Romantically.  Sam
comforted Brooke in her bed," she went on gravely.</p>

<p>"What!?!" Josh exclaimed.  "That's insane.  Brooke's not...gay," he said his
voice dropping secretively as he said that last word.  "She wouldn't...not
with Sam of all people!"</p>

<p>"But she did and she is.  That's why I came to you.  She doesn't know what
she's doing Josh.  She just wanted somebody to love her after you broke up.
But," Nicole said almost giddy to finally be getting to the climax of her
operation.  "if you go to her now, and ask her to take you back, I know you
can help her.  This...aberration with Sam, if it goes on much longer people
will find out.  Can you imagine what would happen?  With Brooke so
vulnerable?  Hell, Spam is probably going to write an editorial about it!
We can't let this ruin her Josh, you have to help straighten her out again,"
Nicole finished dramatically.</p>

<p>"I don't know...I...this is all so," Josh started his mind reeling with
everything Nicole had just told him.</p>

<p>"Josh," she said.  "There's no time for this."</p>

<p>"I'll try," he said finally straightening up.</p>

<p>"No Josh, don't try...DO," Nicole said, her voice hardening a bit now that she
knew she had him.  "You have to fix her, or else things aren't going to be
pleasant for anyone."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" Josh asked seeing the Nicole he knew and feared
starting to rear her head again.</p>

<p>"Brooke won't be the only one to go down if this gets out, I can't allow
that to happen.  Think about it, if everyone finds out that Brooke's
diddling her step-sister what will that say about you?  If our homecoming
queen and head cheerleader is a lipstick lesbian, what does that mean about
our homecoming king and star quarterback?"</p>

<p>"I'm not..." Josh started, but Nicole interrupted him.</p>

<p>"I know that but they don't. o you think that anybody thinks that Brooke is?
  You used to date her, what do you think people are going to think.  And
then there's the Glamazons, we'll all be linked by association like it was
some sort of gay sewing circle.  Do you want to go down like that?" Nicole
asked getting right up in his face.</p>

<p>"No," was his only response.</p>

<p>"Then win her back and do it soon," Nicole responded, and with that she
walked away leaving a dumbfounded Josh staring into space.</p>
