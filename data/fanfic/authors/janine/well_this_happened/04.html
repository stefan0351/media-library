<p>Brooke and Sam marched silently towards the house having been summoned by
their parents moments after Mary Cherry, Popita and a reluctant Nicole, made
their escape.  Sam was certain that if she listened very carefully she could
hear a dirge being carried through the air towards them.</p>

<p>Upon entering the house they were then instructed to go into the living room
and sit down where they would wait patiently to be joined by their parents.
This was related to them in no uncertain terms, and they complied like well
trained boarder collies in the plains of Alberta.</p>

<p>Finally, after leaving the girls to sit in a tortured silence the parental
units entered the room directing the girls to sit on the couch side by side,
where they then took up residence beside their particular child.</p>

<p>“So we had an interesting little chat with Mary Cherry,” Jane began calmly.
She felt like she was dying inside.</p>

<p>“Interesting,” Mike confirmed.  This was ridiculous, Brooke wasn’t even gay.</p>

<p>Brooke and Sam, who had decided that staring at their feet was a brilliant
course of action the moment their parents walked in to the room, decided
that that was still an appropriate course of action and continued to do so
effectively not responding to their parents comments.</p>

<p>“Do you have any idea what we might have chatted about?” Jane asked when it
became clear that neither girl was going to say anything.  This inquiry too
was met by silence. “Sam?”</p>

<p>“Dolce and Gabbana?” Sam responded in a quiet and somewhat pained tone.</p>

<p>“Do you want to guess again?” Jane asked not terribly impressed with her
daughters answer.</p>

<p>“I would prefer not to,” Sam responded honestly, her eyes still firmly
planted on her feet.</p>

<p>Once again the room was covered in silence.</p>

<p>“Mary Cherry indicated…that is to say from her impression…that you, Brooke
and you…Sam…are…which is to say…involved…as it were,” Mike said stumbling
over his words.  He wasn’t quite sure how one went about telling ones own
daughter and the daughter of ones fiancé that one had heard that one’s said
daughter and soon to be step-daughter were engaged in sexual congress.</p>

<p>“In a romantic sense…to phrase it, well, as a phrase,” Jane added trying to
clarify what Mike had begun and only partially succeeding.</p>

<p>In response their question Brooke blinked and twitched her nose while Sam
sniffled and tugged at her ear lobe.</p>

<p>“Do either of you have anything to say?” Mike asked finally at a loss for
what else to do.  They certain weren’t making this easy.</p>

<p>There was a momentarily silence after he posed the question then Sam
responded with,  “The Bronx Zoo has a pair of male chimps who’ve formed a
life bond and who forage and swing together, gathering food in preparation
for disaster — because they don’t know they’re in a zoo.  Their monkeys
after all.  It’s apparently quite moving.  I’ve also heard they have a tap
show.”</p>

<p>This was met by the parents simultaneous and understandable exclamation of,
“ What!?!”</p>

<p>This was in turn met by Brooke, who after inserting her thumb into her mouth
and biting down on it, mumbled, “I’m not pregnant, which I think in any
situation…except for you know in cases of planned parenthood, is a good
thing.  Especially for a teenager…and especially-especially for one who
cheerleads…or hikes, or swims, or something…you know?”</p>

<p>After that last bout of incomprehensibility Jane and Mike looked around
their daughters at each other completely and utterly confused.  Mike figured
that what had just transpired was at least partially his fault for only
demanding an answer, not one that made sense.  It became clear to him that
they were going to get nowhere with the discussion if they continued to beat
around the block, and looking at Jane he could see that she had reached the
same conclusion so, after a silent battle of the wills, Mike addressed the
girls once more.</p>

<p>“Obviously there’s only…we’re just going to have to be straight forward
here.”  He paused here to take a deep breath, then, “Are the two of you
involved with each other romantically?  Called dating in some circles.”</p>

<p>The girls turn to look at each other communicating silently.  They seem to
agree that the parents knew, and that the best course of action is to just
be honest.</p>

<p>Brooke opened her mouth as if to responded, then closed it just as quickly
her eyes returning to the floor.  She remained quiet like that for a moment
before she took a deep breath and looked up again, this time when she opened
her mouth the word “yes” escaped, although it was barely audible.</p>

<p>“Yes?” Jane asked dumbly.  Truthfully, she hadn’t really expected either of
them to admit it.  She had expected to be able to go on believing that Mary
Cherry was just a crack baby.  She was wrong.</p>

<p>Sam pinched the bridge of her nose, she felt a migraine coming on.  Sucking
in a deep breath, she turned to her mother and said “yes” in a breathy voice
that was just barely audible.  It was audible however, and was met with a
steely silence.</p>

<p>“Since?” Mike asked taking in a deep breath, and trying to curb the hysteria
that was rapidly building up inside of him.</p>

<p>It was Brooke who answered this time, her gaze once again focused intently
on her shoes.  “While you were in Hawaii we…gained closeness,” she related
in a highly uncomfortable voice shifting in her seat jostling her already
discombobulated father.</p>

<p>Jane took in a deep, shuddering breath, then raised her hand to her head as
her shoulders shook slightly.  She was not prepared to deal with this.  Sam
and Brooke, despite what she had seen, she had never thought, never would
have thought, couldn’t have bared to think about it.  But there it was.</p>

<p>“That’s…a while,” she finally said in a hushed tone, her voice cracking as
she spoke.  She raised her hand to her face again brushing a stray strand of
hair behind her ear, trying to psych herself up for her next question.
“Have you…” she paused her taking another deep breath, at least oxygen
deprivation wouldn’t be a problem for her,  “been intimate?” she finally
asked.  Once the question was out of her mouth, she realized that the answer
was bound to disappoint her however it went.  If it was yes, then it was
yes, if it was no, then it was a yet.</p>

<p>“Mom!” Sam squeaked jumping up off the couch.  She was seriously distressed.
  “You don’t…you can’t…boundaries…” she muttered calming down and bit and
sitting back down when her mother motioned for her to do so.  “You just
don’t…” she continued lamely looking at the cactus plant in the corner of
the room like it was her new best friend.</p>

<p>“Brooke?” Mike asked anxiously seriously unnerved by Sam’s reaction.  What
the hell was that?</p>

<p>Brooke looked at him blinking rapidly.  “I … we … what?” was all she was
able to get out before she dissolved into merely opening and closing her
mouth, while occasionally scrunching up her brow in a look of intense
consternation.</p>

<p>Mike and Jane turned and looked at each other.  They could see it in each
others eyes.  They were human, and they had been kids, and they both knew
without a doubt that what their daughters lack of an answer meant was ‘yes’,
yes they had.  They had but they couldn’t make themselves say it.</p>

<p>“We have to go,” Mike responded finally.  “Talk.  We have to go talk,” he
continued haltingly looking over at Jane, who didn’t seem to be faring much
better than he himself was.</p>

<p>“Yes, talk,” Jane responded slowly, her mind slowly clearing a little.
“Until…until,” Jane continued lamely,  “Sam will be staying with me in the
guest room,” she continued, lucid enough to realize that this was a
necessary course of action.</p>

<p>“Mom!” Sam exclaimed, her proclivity towards indignation momentarily
overwhelming her common sense.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” Jane said turning to her warningly.   “You don’t even want to hear
what my response would be,” she continued in a low voice.  Sam was quiet
after that, thankful to still be alive.</p>

<p>“I get to stay in my room right?” Brooke asked.  Mike responded by shooting
her gaze of arctic temperature, and like Sam she too was quiet again.</p>

<p>After that was decided, Mike and Jane stood up, and headed out of the room,
leaving the two quiet girls sitting on the couch.  They both followed their
parents progress, sighing deeply and leaning back against the back of the
couch once they had exited the room.</p>

<p>“You know that this has only just begun,” Brooke commented her eyes closing.
  She felt like she was going to cry, it was so depressing.  The lying had
been going so very, very well for them.  Grey skies were finally starting to
clear up, and now this.</p>

<p>“I have to move in with my mom,” Sam responded, still harping on her mothers
last declaration.</p>

<p>“They’re gonna be watching us like hawks,” Brooke pointed out pouting.</p>

<p>“I have to move in with my mom,” Sam responded.  She seemed to be having
difficulties moving past this particular particular.</p>

<p>“Schools going to be the fun part,” Brooke replied.</p>

<p>“This is so sad,” Sam breathed out turning to look at Brooke.</p>

<p>“I’m going to kill Mary Cherry,” the cheerleader declared a moment later.
Sam was right, this was very sad and Mary Cherry was to blame.  Well,
certainly, she and Sam played a little part in it, but it was much easier to
blame Mary Cherry.</p>

<p>“I’ll be your alibi,” Sam responded.</p>

<p>“Acceptable,” Brooke responded.  They were young, and pretty, they could
beat any criminal charges couldn’t they?</p>

<p>“What now?” Sam asked looking at Brooke searching for answers.</p>

<p>“I was planning on being silent and morose for a while. You could be
brooding and introspective?” Brooke suggested at a complete loss as to what
else to do.</p>

<p>“Sounds good,” Sam responded.</p>

<p>And there was quiet in the room once again.</p>

<p>"She always has to push it," Jane said agitatedly as she paced the
span of their bedroom restlessly.  "The easy road, no not my Sam,"
she continued shaking her head.  "You know, I was really becoming
okay with the whole Sam is gay thing.  I was being very mom of the
new millennium about it.  I bought an Alice Walker book!" Jane
exclaimed excitedly.  "I think I could have come around to the whole
Brooke is gay thing too.   We do live in L.A. after all.  But, this
gay together ... this, this, this, being gay together.  No.  I'm
sorry.  I don't think it's too much to ask that they be gay with
other people...other *celibate* people!" </p>

<p>"They said they didn't...you know, do it," Mike responded clinging to
the last shred of hope he had.  Jane had had far more time to prepare
for the gay in general than he did, and he most definitely wasn't
ready to approach the gay together.  How could both of them be gay?
Seriously, what were the odds.  He tried to calculate them, and they
were about on par with the odds of the Florida Marlins winning the
World Series.  This was a mathematical improbability, he was sure of
it.</p>

<p>"I know," Jane, said dismally.  "That just means it's 90% likely they
have!  I mean, that's what I told my mom, and I SO had," she
continued spinning about to face her finance.  Her soon to be
husband.  The man she had asked to adopt her daughter.  Sam's soon to
be father.  She placed her hands in her head and took a deep
shuddering breath.  God, they were practically sisters.  Sure, they
weren't related by blood, and it wasn't illegal in 49 states or
anything — as far as she knew — but still.  Jane was officially
overwhelmed. </p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" Mike asked.  Of the two of them Jane
seemed to have a better handle on the situation and he was willing to
leave things to her discretion if it meant that he didn't have to
think about it at the moment. </p>

<p>Jane stared at him for a moment, then dramatically threw her hands up
in the air in the universal 'I duh nuh' gesture.  </p>

<p>"Do you think they'll stop if we tell them too?" Mike asked
hopefully. Jane shot him a look that could peel paint and he was
quite again. </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"What are you doing?" Sam asked watching Brooke leaf through
something in the kitchen.  They had sat for a while, but upon hearing
a thump upstairs, they decided that it would be better to be in an
upright position so that they could run away, or leap over high
furniture in a single bound, if need be.</p>

<p>"How do you feel about snow?"  Brooke asked trailing her finger down
the piece of  paper studiously.  </p>

<p>"It's alright I suppose.  Why?"  Sam asked suspiciously as she walked
over to Brooke. </p>

<p>"We could move to Ontario and get hitched.  If we did that not only
could they not do anything about it, we'd be able to legally drink in
a few years, AND we'd get free medical care … I think, they're
socialist right?" Brooke responded turning to observe Sam's
reaction.  The brunette merely stared at her.  "It was just a
suggestion," Brooke mumbled putting the bus schedule away.  "It could
have worked," she responded when Sam continued to merely stare at
her.  Sam just stared at her some more.  "Okay, maybe not, but at
least I'm trying here." </p>

<p>"That's true," Sam responded thoughtfully.  She should try and come
up with something too. Unfortunately the only thing she could think
of was,  "They're also very tolerant in Sweden." </p>

<p>"Why are the cold countries so much more progressive?" Brooke asked
thoughtfully as she idly leaned against the kitchen counter.  Sam
shrugged.  Brooke shrugged back.  They were too busy wondering where
their parents were going to bury their bodies to consider such things
at the moment. </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Well, we've already established that Sam is moving into the guest
bedroom," Jane said trying to force her brain to work.  "That
conjoined bathroom is like a modern day underground railroad of
debauchery," she continued somewhat bitterly as she frowned. </p>

<p>"We could also get cameras and an intercom system, and then yell at
them over the loud speakers if we saw an inappropriate touching,"
Mike suggested, his mind filling with design specs instead of images
of his daughter engaged in debauchery with Gina Gershon, Jr. </p>

<p>"Scar them for life so that they'll never be able to have a healthy
relationship!  Why didn't I think of that," Jane responded
sarcastically, making it perfectly clear to everyone where Sam got it
from.   "What about boarding school?" </p>

<p>"They're mostly all girls," Mike responded.   They looked at each
other and crossed that one off the list.  They were going to be at
this for a while.</p>

<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 40: "The End of The Affair"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The silence in the room was deafening.  Sam was aware of every whir,
and thump, and tick in the house as she went about unloading her
essentials into the guest room.  Her mother was on the other side of
the room fixing the other bed.  They had been in there for almost
fifteen minutes and hadn't spoken a word to each other.  The most
contact they had had was Jane looking up at her when she entered the
room and then pointing towards where Sam could deposit her things.
Sam stopped what she was doing and looked across the room at her
mothers back.  Since the family chat in the afternoon, things in the
house had been kind of surreal.  The elders had spent most of their
time upstairs discussing god knows what about the situation, and she
and Brooke had kind of wandered around the downstairs in a stupefied
haze.  It was like they had been living in a bubble for the past
three hours.  Looking at her mom, and hearing only stony silence, Sam
knew the bubble had burst.  They were all now painfully aware of the
reality of the situation.</p>

<p>"Mom," Sam said, unable to take the silence anymore.  Jane turned to
look at her, her face unreadable.  She was pale and the muscles in
her face were tightly drawn.  "Where should I put my socks?" Sam
asked off-put by the unhinged look on her mothers face.  She had
planned on saying something meaningful, and significant, but she
panicked.</p>

<p>"In the sock drawer Sam," Jane responded tiredly.  Sam nodded
vigorously, the sock drawer, of course, and turned towards the sock
drawer.  Well, she thought to herself, that went well.  Picking up
her socks, she began to fold them.  Suddenly folding her socks was of
the utmost importance.  With the attention she was paying to folding
her socks, one would have thought those socks could one day be the
cure for cancer.</p>

<p>Jane watched Sam folding those socks, studied her intensely, her
stomach clenching and unclenching painfully as the reality of their
situation clubbed her over the head in a psychotic circle.  "Do you
have everything you need?" Jane asked finally.  Talking tended to
distract her, and she was getting very tired of thinking.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded, hesitatingly halting her sock
folding.  "Everything I need is here," she continued fiddling with
the sock she held in her hand nervously.  She was lying of course,
there were many things that she needed that weren't there.  One being
her spine, but the most significant being Brooke.</p>

<p>Jane nodded, her eyes drifting to the little table that Sam had set
up to but her personal effects on.  There were a few pictures of
herself with Carmen, Lily and Harrison, the ever present picture of
her father,  and another one that hadn't been part of her set up
before.  It was of a little girl, and was resting against a flower
vase.  Jane stared at it for a moment in confusion until she realized
that the little girl in the picture was Brooke.  She remembered
seeing the same photograph in an album Mike had shown her one time.
It was in the She-Ra section.  Still looking at the picture, she
realized that the rose in the vase holding the picture up also must
have come from Brooke.  She turned her attention back to making the
bed, something about the familiarity — or if she was perfectly honest
with herself, the tenderness — of the display forcing her to look
away.</p>

<p>"Are we going to talk about this?" Sam blurted out moments after her
mother turned from studying the picture.  There was a confrontational
edge to her voice, an irritation that she hadn't meant to project,
but there it was.  And it was honest, she realized, it was there
because that's how she felt.  She had seen her mother looking at the
picture of Brooke, she had seen the emotions float across her
features, and she had seen her deny the meaning of the picture by
turning away.  The truth was that she didn't know what was going
through their heads, she didn't know if they thought that she and
Brooke were just in it for the sex or what.  She didn't know because
they hadn't talked about it.  She was in love with Brooke, and if she
was going to go down, she wanted that to be known at least.  She
wanted them to know that it was more than just fucking, it was love.</p>

<p>Jane turned around once again, meeting her daughters eyes.  There was
a strength in them, an assertiveness that she hadn't seen only
moments before.  "To tell you the truth Sam, I don't even know where
to begin," Jane responded finally.  Her voice was heavily, like her
body felt.  It was an effort for her to remain standing, the
weariness she felt seeping into bones, into her marrow.</p>

<p>"Just ask," Sam replied in a softer tone, watching her mother
carefully.  She wasn't really sure what she was watching for, or if
she would recognize it when she saw it, only that watching her seemed
to be a good idea.</p>

<p>Jane was silent for a while after Sam spoke.  She had brought her
hand up to her face and was tugging on her ear viciously.  She sat
down on the bed, then stood back up, then sat down on the bed again,
all the while tugging on her ear and closing and opening her eyes.
Sam could practically feel the tension rolling off of her.  She got
the distinct impression that the calm was gone, and the storm had
arrived.</p>

<p>"What were you thinking!?!" Jane asked finally, standing up once
more.  Her voice was loud, a yell even, her tone critical, and
confused and horrified.  "Are you stupid!?!  Is that it?  Did I drop
you at some point during your childhood and forget about it?  What
were you thinking!?!" she continued almost manically.</p>

<p>"I wasn't," Sam stuttered.  She had expected something like that but
at the same time she hadn't been prepared for it.  She could count
the number of times she had heard her mother raise her voice to her
on one hand without doubling.  As a result she had never gotten quite
used to it.  This time was different from those other few times
however, this time there was something more to it, though what that
more was Sam couldn't quite identify.  "I mean…it just…I couldn't
help it, it just happened," she continued still off-kilter.</p>

<p>"It just happened," Jane muttered under her breath incredulously, a
darkly amused looked coming over her face, a homicidal hilarity
coating her tone.  "What? She bent down to tie her shoe and you fell
into her?" she continued her voice raising sharply once
more.  "Spontaneous combustion just happens, sleeping with your step-
sister doesn't just happen!  Lying to me, and sneaking around behind
my back doesn't just happen!"</p>

<p>The hostility in her mothers voice was enough to snap Sam out of the
momentary daze she had gone into, and stepping forward she responded
to her mother with as much passion as she had been spoken to with.</p>

<p>"But it does," Sam started.  "That's exactly what happened.  It was
spontaneous combustion.  I'm sorry I lied, and that we sneaked
around, but I don't think that you can pretend to be shocked that we
did.  I mean, I liked MY room," Sam went on still not able to move
past the repossession of her room.  It came down the fact that she
had to say her piece, whether she said it now or later, it wasn't
going to be easy, and it wasn't going to be fun, but it had to be
done.  The damage had been done, and honesty was now the only way to
control it.  </p>

<p>"You might not want to hear this, in fact I'm certain that you don't
and that you won't believe me anyway … but I love her.  Sincerely,
fully.  That's what just happened.  It's like she set a fire inside
of my heart," she continued her voice cracking.  Her tone had gotten
softer as she spoke, more reverent and resonant.  "I mean, come on.
Do you really think that I would have chosen Brooke of all people if
I had had a choice.  Brooke who I've hated with a passion so intense
it has no name since I came out of the womb?" Her voice was as
incredulous as her mothers had been earlier when she asked this.  She
knew that both her mom and Mr. McQueen had been very aware of their
previous hatred of each other, and thought that a reminder would
help.  "Come on mom!  We didn't do this to screw you over.  We didn't
do this to be trendy, or to rebel against `the man'," Sam went
on.  "We just couldn't not.  We just didn't have a choice….I just
love her more than I can express in words, and, well, this happened,"
she finished flinging her hands up in the air with a flourish.  </p>

<p>Jane sat back down on the bed, with what Sam would characterize as a
pout on her face.  There she sat, brooding and ruminating, and
contemplating for a few moments before looking back over at her
daughter.  </p>

<p>"What am I…we suppose to do about this, huh?" Jane asked finally.
There was a note of helplessness and desperation in her voice.  Like
she was actually looking for suggestions.  </p>

<p>"Nothing," Sam responded.  As long as her mom was asking her opinion
she could as well give it.  "Short of sending one of us to another
country.  I'm in love with her, and I can't stop that anymore than I
could stop breathing," she continued, blinking back tears.</p>

<p>Jane observed her daughter thoughtfully for a moment, watching as she
tried to retain control over her emotions, considering for a time
what had happened.  Her eyes drifted back over the picture and the
flower, a reflective expression coming over her face.  She continued
to look at it for a moment more, then stood up and sighed before
saying, "Finish folding your socks."  </p>

<p>With that she stood up and walked out of the room leaving Sam to her
thoughts, and her tears.</p>

<p>Brooke tore her attention away from the hallway where she swore she
could hear voices.  She knew that Sam and Jane were fixing up the
guest room, she had been banned from helping but her father had
helped carry some of the heavier things across the hall.  When he had
finished about twenty minutes before, he had come to her room to talk
to her. </p>

<p>"It's been a dry heat really.  For me I think that's almost worse
then when the humidity's really high," Brooke stated philosophically
turning back to face her father.  They had been talking about the
weather since Mike had joined her.  Brooke was familiar with this
type of conversation, they always talked about the weather when Mike
wanted to talk to her about something but didn't know how to.  When
he had noticed her rapidly losing weight and not eating, they had
discussed that feeling you get before it rains, and when they talked
about her mother leaving, hurricane season had come up.</p>

<p>"Dry heat has always been the worse for me too," Mike
responded.  "There's just been no wind lately.  When there's a nice
breeze it can make up for the heat, but without it, well things just
aren't that pleasant," he continued with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"I heard a cold front is moving in from the north," Brooke
commented.  "That should cool things down a bit," she went on hoping
that things didn't too cold.  Despite the heat the cheerleading
uniform didn't really provide much protection, and the last thing
that Brooke wanted was to get a cold.  That would just be like lemon
juice in an open wound.</p>

<p>"Let's just hope it doesn't get too cold," Mike replied to
that.  "When it got really cold in March last year, I was never able
to get used to it, ruined my whole week.  This California climate's
ruined me," he continued.  Brooke nodded but didn't say anything.</p>

<p>They sat in silence, only turning momentarily when they heard raised
voices from across the hall once again.  Brooke looked out into the
hallway longingly.  Frankly, she wished that she and her dad could
just duke it out like it sounded like the McPherson women were
doing.  McQueen's, she had come to realize, didn't talk about
problems, they let them fester, and grow, and then when they couldn't
be ignored any longer, they had awkward conversations, where they
beat around the bush until they were too exhausted to actually talk
about what was wrong.  However, Brooke no longer felt like discussing
the latest news from the weather network, in fact it disturbed her
that she had watched the weather network before coming up to her room
because she knew what was going to happen.  She wanted to talk to her
father, she wanted him to yell at her, and emote and express his
feelings.  For once she wanted to have a normal fight.</p>

<p>"How come we can't do that?" Brooke asked finally waving her hand at
the door.  She sounded irritated, and she was.</p>

<p>"What?" Mike asked.</p>

<p>"Yell at each other," Brooke responded as if it was the most
reasonable thing in the world.  "That's what people do.  The teen
does something the parent doesn't like, the parent calls them on it,
the teen makes some sort of smart-ass remark, and then comes the
yelling," she continued gaining steam.  "That's normal.  This,
contemplation of the weather is not healthy.  I mean don't you have
anything to say?  I mean, I'm dating your fiancés daughter…doesn't
that just make you want to yell like you care about something?" she
finished in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>Mike shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  Of course he wanted to say
something, he had a myriad of thoughts, comments and questions about
the situation, he just didn't know how to go about voicing things.
People in his family avoided confrontation, it was how they had
managed to appear to be a happy family for generations.  You didn't
confront things, you ignored them and hoped they went away.  </p>

<p>"I don't know what to say Brooke," he responded finally, standing up
and beginning to pace the room.  "I mean," he threw his hands up in
the air and shook his head at her.  "I don't know what to say
Brooke," he repeated helplessly.</p>

<p>Brooke sighed and looked at the floor.  The cycle continued.</p>

<p>"I kissed her first," Brooke said finally.</p>

<p>"What?" Mike asked turning to face her.</p>

<p>"It started out as a bet, I had to kiss her to win it," Brooke went
on ignoring his question.  "I thought it would be easy, and it was,"
her voice was soft, almost awed, "I just never thought.  It was like
everything went into techno-colour.  But it was Sam, and I tried to
tell myself that I was having a mental situation, but it didn't feel
like a mental situation.  The only thing that felt wrong was denying
it.  And before I knew it, before I could even consider it and talk
myself out of it, I had gone from hating her loving her.  I love her,
I need her," she continued her a rush, the words pouring out of her
mouth without thought without hesitation.  When she finished speaking
she looked up meeting her fathers eyes.  Now all she had to do was
wait and see what he was going to do with the information she had
just given him.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you need.  You won't know what you need until
your forty and you don't have it," Mike responded dismissively,
somewhat unhinged by the flow of words and thoughts Brooke had just
unleashed upon him.</p>

<p>"I need her," Brooke repeated standing up and walking over to where
he father was.  "I love her," she continued somewhat
confrontationally.</p>

<p>"No you don't," he responded.  His voice was still calm, but Brooke
could tell that he was cracking under the pressure.  A little bit
more, and they would actually be having a conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," she said forcefully.  "She's the first and last thing I
think about every day," she continued not backing down.   "I've never
felt the way I do when I'm with her."</p>

<p>"In all your extensive experience, right?" Mike commented
sarcastically as he turned to face her.  "How do you know what you
want?  What you need?" he asked dubiously.  "You used to kiss your
Scott Baio poster every night and every morning, I suppose he's your
soul mate too! Come on Brooke, you're not even old enough to remember
who shot J.R.!" he continued.  </p>

<p>"Age ain't nothin' but a number," Brooke responded channeling Aaliyah
for a moment.  "We're older than Romeo and Juliet, nobody said they
weren't old enough to be in love, to know what love was and that it
was each other," she continued passionately.</p>

<p>"Why do people keep using that play as an example?" Mike asked
irritably.  "They died.  It was a damn TRAGEDY!"</p>

<p>"But this doesn't have to be," Brooke said pointing the doorway.  "We
don't have to be.  The situation sucks, I get that, but IT IS the
situation.  Whether you believe it or not Sam and I are in love with
each other, it's not rational, it's not convenient, and yeah, it's a
little bit awkward but that's how it is!" Brooke yelled at him.  "I'm
telling you right now that after all we've been through, nothing
short of death or expatriation is going to break us up!"</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" Mike asked at a loss for what else to say.  The truth was
that the situation was harder for him to grasp because he could tell
that there was a genuine depth of emotion between the two girls.  If
it had just been about sex, or about rebellion, or about fashion, he
could have dealt with it, he could have put his foot down and
demanded that a stop be put to whatever was going on.  But now, there
was Brooke taking about love, talking about commitment, and
expatriation.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke responded somewhat confused by her fathers schoolyard
response but stepping up the challenge nonetheless.  </p>

<p>"Well…you're grounded!" Mike shot back immediately.  "So there."
Brooke gaped at him absolutely stunned.  She couldn't believe what
she was hearing.  Was she talking to her father or her six year old
cousin Russ?</p>

<p>"You can't do that!  Grounding out of antagonism is strictly
forbidden!" Brooke finally responded angrily.  She could feel tears
stinging her eyes and impatiently brought her hand up to her face to
rub them away.</p>

<p>After Brooke spoke, Mike observed her intently for a moment.  Her
eyes were misty as she rubbed at them, but she wasn't outright
crying.  Her body was trembling slightly, but her voice was strong.
Her tone was commanding, but her eyes pleading.  She was terrified
and was trying not to show it.   It was what she was terrified of
that caused him to pause.  She knew that he wasn't going to kick her
out of the house, that much had to be clear to her already.  She knew
there was no danger of physical violence.  So what could she possibly
have been so scared of?  After a few moments thought, what seemed
like a lifetime of contemplation, he was able to come up with only
one answer, that Brooke  was afraid that she would lose Sam.  </p>

<p>"I know I'm not old enough to drink, or vote, but can't you
understand that that doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy
world of ours," Brooke went on when he didn't say anything.  "You
love Jane.  I love Sam.  It's the same thing," she continued in a
rush.  "There's a certain symmetry to that, isn't there?"</p>

<p>Mike was distracted from responding, by the sound of footsteps in the
hallway.  Turning his head to the side he saw Jane exit the guest
bedroom.  She looked around for a moment then spotted him looking out
into the hallway from Brooke's room.  She motioned him out into the
hallway, and after muttering something to Brooke that sounded
like "we'll talk later" he followed Jane out into the hallway,
closing Brooke's door behind him.</p>

<p>Brooke slumped down into her chair as soon as the door closed and
sighed.  "That went well," she commented to herself, before chuckling
morosely and turning to look out the window.  It looked like rain.
She was right, there was a cold front coming.</p>

<p>Sam rubbed at her eyes wearily, letting out a tired sigh.  She didn't
even need to look at herself to know that she had heavy bags under
her eyes, and that she probably looked as bad as she felt.  To call
the previous night hell, would have been an understatement of epic
proportions.  Hell never looked so good.  The entire evening had been
marked by an oppressive, terse silence.  Anxiousness pervaded their
every movement, indeed, by the end of the night it seemed to Sam as
if the furniture was becoming uncomfortable as well.  And, when she
arrived in the room she was to share with her mother — for who knew
how long — things only got worse.  They hardly spoke to each other,
and when they did it was cumbersome and ungainly, as if they had been
strained on a desert island for years and had become unaccustomed to
conversing with human beings — halting, and stuttering and stumbling
about.  There had been as ease, a flow to their relationship with
other, Jane treating Sam with a respect and comfort that Sam had
always appreciated and considered to be quite rare.  That harmony
which had characterized their relationship with each other had been
disrupted now, polarized, until Sam hardly recognized it.  When she
got up in the night to go to the washroom and was questioned by her
mother like it was the Spanish Inquisition, she realized what had
changed.  The trust Jane had always had in her was gone, that
intrinsic belief that she knew who her daughter, shattered.  Sam felt
like a stranger to Jane, and she was beginning to feel like a
stranger to herself.</p>

<p>"We have to form a unified front."  Sam blinked and turned her head
to the side.  It was Brooke.  She had almost forgotten that the
blonde was standing there.</p>

<p>"It's breakfast, not the invasion of Normandy," Sam responded.  If
she had worn glasses she would have taken that opportunity to take
them off and clean them, staring into the translucent surface
thoughtfully. </p>

<p>"This is not just breakfast.  Certainly it's breakfast, but it's not
JUST breakfast.  This is the breakfast to end all breakfasts," Brooke
responded tensely.  Sam looked over at her thoughtfully.  The blonde
was paler than usually, her features tightly drawn, her lips forming
a thin line.  She looked older and, Sam thought, distinguished.
Angst was a look Brooke wore well, wore with dignity Sam decided.
Still, she would have washed every trace of it away without the
slightest hesitation, if she could have.</p>

<p>"Maybe we should come up with a secret handshake, or buy matching
decoder rings," Sam responded a moment later.  Uniforms, and secret
rituals always made people seem more impressive than they actually
were.  Brooke glanced over at her but didn't respond to her
verbally.  Instead she took her bottom lip between her teeth, biting
down softly and stared out the window with slightly hooded eyes.</p>

<p>"Your mom likes eggs benedict," the blonde said a moment later her
voice curling as she spoke the last part making the whole sentence
sound like a question.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded nodding her head.  "And your dad likes grits,"
she added a moment later.  They had prepared both of those dishes
earlier on, with an impressive swiftness.  Was it as a bribe?  A
peace offering?  A prostitution?  They didn't know, they only knew
that at the time, in the silence, in the dark of the early morning,
it seemed like a good thing to do.</p>

<p>"It won't make a difference will it?" Brooke asked releasing her lip
and turning to face Sam.</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded.  "I don't expect that it will."</p>

<p>"I think," Brooke began, then stopped.  She was quiet for a moment,
looking down at her feet, her lip back between her teeth being gnawed
at once again.  "I think," she said starting once again, apparently
having regained her train of thought, "that I had convinced myself
that things would be different when they found out.  You know, like
one of those dream sequences in soap operas where everyone smiles and
hugs, and rose petals fall from above, and a rainbow appears even
though there isn't a cloud in the sky."  She sounded damaged, like a
ten year old who had just been told that there was no Santa Claus.
Sounding terribly trite even to herself Sam thought, we're not in
Kansas anymore.</p>

<p>"That's why I live mostly in my mind," is what the brunette said out-
loud however.  She had wanted to say something comforting, something
that would make it all go away, something that could give Brooke her
rainbow, but there wasn't anything she could say that could do that.
This was the reality of the situation, and they had spent perhaps
their entire relationship ignoring it.</p>

<p>Brooke was about to respond when the clicking of shoes on the tile of
the floor brought her attention to the doorway.  Sam followed her
gaze and they both watched as their parents entered the kitchen.
Their faces were as still as stone.  Brooke opened her mouth to
speak, she had pre-planned what she was going to say to them when
they entered the kitchen, it was witty and charming, the perfect ice-
breaker or hostility disarmer.  It was suppose to make them laugh
easily, and then stop and think about the banality of the situation,
the utter ridiculousness of it, and bring them to a new
understanding, the rising sun shining brightly through the kitchen
window warming them all.  The reality was that almost as soon as she
opened her mouth she closed it again and bit her lip once more, not
emoting a word or a sound.</p>

<p>They took their seats.</p>

<p>Mike pinched the bridge of his nose, and sighed deeply.  Jane rubbed
her bottom lip with her thumb mutely, her eyes focused on her plate.
Sam sat with her fork poised over her plate, the utensil shuddering
minutely because of the trembling of her hand.  Brooke sat still,
except for her hands, which took off and replaced the ring with wore
on her right repeatedly, her skin chaffing slightly under the assault.</p>

<p>The clock ticked noisily in the background.  They still had thirty
minutes before they could politely remove themselves from each others
company.</p>

<p>Nicole looked to side, observing Brooke out the corner of her eye.
She and the taller blonde had been stalking through the hallways for
almost fifteen minutes, but they had ended up nowhere.  Brooke was
walking, but Nicole was certain that she didn't have any idea where
she was going, and she was pretty sure that she didn't give a good
god damn about it either.  She was walking because she needed to
move, because if she stayed still, she would be forced to think and
she was forced to think, she might just have a mental breakdown.</p>

<p>"Everything's falling apart," Brooke mumbled softly as they passed
their lockers for the third time.  Thoughts of her rapidly
deteriorating family environment were haunting her, silences and
reproachful looks running through her brain over and over again,
taunting her.</p>

<p>"You didn't need to be a close acquaintance of Dionne Warwick to
predict that," Nicole responded.  Brooke looked off into the distance
moodily only regaining her focus when she heard her name being called
from somewhere just in front of her.</p>

<p>"Hey Brooke," Randy Dunn called from his position against his locker
door.  "Ellen called she wants her shtick back!" he continued smiling
at his own wit.</p>

<p>"Hey Randy, Rick James called he wants his hair-cut back!" Brooke
responded in a clipped tone.  She wasn't in the mood to trade barbs
with some insecure asshole at the moment.</p>

<p>"Dyke," Randy shot back.  He liked his hair, and it was all he could
think of.</p>

<p>"Was that you or your baby dick talking?  I couldn't hear over the
shrill cries of overcompensation," Brooke replied dryly, a small but
suitably malicious smile working its way across her face as the
people in the hallway around them chuckled at her comment.</p>

<p>"Bitch," Randy spat at her.  How did she know?</p>

<p>"Don't talk about your mamma that way," Brooke responded continuing
down the hall effective ending the conversation the undisputed
winner.  She hated to have a battle of the wits with someone so
poorly armed, but a girl had to do what a girl had to do.  The truth
was she felt slightly better after ripping him a new asshole.  As
they continued to walk down the hall she wondered if Nicole had been
onto something all these years.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Sam rubbed at her eyes tiredly for what seemed like the billionth
time that morning.  "You don't understand.  I got up to go to the
washroom and it was like the Salem witch hunts."</p>

<p>"Can you really blame her?  She's got to be paranoid.  You and Brooke
have been sneaking around with amazing proficiency for almost two
months," Carmen responded.</p>

<p>"All I wanted was some water," Sam replied pouting.  "Besides I'm not
an idiot, like I was really going to sneak into her the room the
night they found out!" she continued indignantly.  "I'm rather fond
of this little thing called life."</p>

<p>"Despite the suspicion you've got it pretty good," Lily
commented.  "From what you said, it sounded like they handled
everything exceptionally well."</p>

<p>"I know," Sam admitted grudgingly.  "It's just that now everything's
so tense.  Breakfast was nightmare, I was afraid to pass her the
milk.  And Mr. McQueen, you should have seen how he was looking at
me.  Suddenly I could identify most excruciatingly with the
saying `if looks could kill'" </p>

<p>"Well, you are banging his daughter.  Parents, especially fathers
tend to get upset when people bang their daughters.  In fact daughter
banging is…" Carmen responded not quite able to hide her smile.</p>

<p>"Can you pretend like this isn't a supreme source of amusement?" Sam
asked interrupting her friends diatribe irritably.  Most of them time
she dealt with Carmen's teasing well, she knew that the girl meant
well, but there was a time and place for it and this wasn't it.  "On
the outside this might seem funny, but inside it's really, really
sad," she continued wretchedly.  "Did I tell you they're making us go
to a family therapist!?!"</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound like such a bad idea," Carmen commented
objectively.  "You know, as long as you get to hit each other with
multi-coloured `take that bitch' padded bats," she continued making a
whacking action with her arm.</p>

<p>"Yeah, those aren't so bad," Sam admitted before frowning again.</p>

<p>Mike closed the study door with a shake of his head.  He couldn't
believe he had forgotten to fax those papers to the office in
Singapore.  Then again considering the stress he had been under for
the past few days, he realized that it was only bound to happen.  He
was just glad that he remembered in time to send them.  As he headed
to the stairs he heard Brooke's voice, and stopped his movements.
Turning around he looked into the kitchen, spotting two figures
silhouetted in the moonlight.  Blending into the shadows he watched
the scene unfolding in front of him.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke watched Sam with hooded eyes as she rested her weight on the
kitchen table.  "You look miserable," she commented finally.  With
the way everything had been since their parents found out, they
hadn't had much time to spend together, even to talk, and now that
they had stumbled across some alone time, Brooke wasn't going to
waste it brooding in the dark.</p>

<p>"So do you," Sam responded, her lips twitching, but not able to form
a smile.  Her eyes didn't even try, maintaining that haunted look
throughout her statement.</p>

<p>"That's because I am," Brooke responded with a weary half smile of
her own.  Her voice sounded distant, even to her, and she wondered if
she looked as worn-out as she felt.  The past few days seemed to have
sucked everything out of her.  Her reserves were depleted, and she
knew it was beginning to show.  She wanted to stay strong for Sam,
but she could feel herself crumbling too.</p>

<p>"I guess it goes without saying that I am too," Sam responded
lowering her gaze to the floor, where it remained for a long moment.
When she finally looked up, she sniffed and Brooke could see her
trying to blink back tears.  She raised her eyes to ceiling and
breathed out, "God, I hate this.  I feel like something's breaking
inside of me," she continued a tear escaping the prison of her eye
lashes and trailing down her face.</p>

<p>Brooke pushed herself off the table when she saw this and crossed the
short distance over to Sam, regarding her helplessly for a moment
before reaching out her hand and placing it on Sam's cheek, stroking
the soft skin gently with her thumb.  "Please," Brooke said in almost
pleading tone.  "Don't cry.  I don't think I could take it if you
cried," she continued resting her forehead against Sam's.  "It'll be
okay," she said, she could still feel tiny shivers running through
the brunette's body.  She took her free hand and joined their fingers
together.  "We shall overcome," she went on somewhat desperately.  It
paid off however, since she heard Sam chuckle softly, and
whisper, "thanks Mrs. Tubman," before she buried her head in Brooke's
neck, drawing the blonde into a hug.</p>

<p>After a moment, once she was sure that Sam was no longer crying,
Brooke stepped back slightly so that she could see the entirety of
Sam's face.  She raised her hand to Sam's cheek once again, stroking
it as she had before, a contemplative look on her face.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you something," she began a moment later, her
voice low, but intense.  "And no matter what happens I want you to
remember this.  I love you," she said stressing each of the three
words.  "Before you, I was walking in shadows, you showed me the
sun.  And, he can ground me, or send me off to England where I'll
start referring to underwear as knickers, but it won't change the
fact that I love you.  I want you to remember that, to know that
you're my heart," she concluded.  Her voice had cracked a few times
as she spoke, and she knew that she too know bore the telltale signs
of fallen tears.</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that," Sam responded immediately.  "Like it's
already over. It can't be over.  I need you," she continued another
tear running down her face as she stepped into Brooke once more where
she was enveloped into an almost desperate hug.</p>

<p>Finally, pulling herself together, Brooke turned her head to the side
and placed a soft kiss on the side of Sam's forehead.  "It'll be
alright," she said softly.  Her tone was suppose to be reassuring,
but in it Sam could hear that Brooke was just as lost as her, just as
confused and heartbroken, and scared.  She didn't know that things
would be alright, she just hoped they would.  She tightened the hold
she had on the cheerleader.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Mike slipped away after this, heading towards the stairs making very
certain that they wouldn't see him.  He made his way up the stairs on
unsteady legs, quite shaken by what he had witnessed.  Until he saw
them there, interacting with each other so tenderly, he had truly
thought that their relationship was just some kind of teen fling, but
the agony in their voices couldn't be denied. The broken heartedness
in Brooke's voice and Sam's tears had been evidence enough to force
him to reconsider his thoughts on the situation.  He realized that
they sincerely meant something to each other, and although he wasn't
sure how, he knew that that changed things.</p>

<p>Mike watched Brooke head out the door, Sam had exited the house just
before her and from his position in the hallway he could see the
brunette getting into the back of Nicole's convertible.  Brooke was
soon out the door too shutting it behind her with a soft click.  He
noted sadly that the fluidity of movement Brooke seemed to have been
possessed with since she came out of the womb was absent then, and
had been absent for a long time, since they had found out about the
girls relationship he admitted.  Her shoulders seemed to now have a
perpetual slump to them, and her feet dragged along the ground as if
she couldn't spare the energy to lift them up properly anymore.
There was an ungainliness to her movements, like the metronome inside
of her, which had previously guided her motions, had been
unceremoniously smashed into tiny little bits leaving her shaken and
unsure.  It broke his heart to see this shriveled up, broken down
version of his daughter roaming around.</p>

<p>Jane walked up behind him, placing her hand on his shoulder.  He had
been staring at the closed door for over a minute.</p>

<p>"Come sit down," she said softly, guiding him towards the dinning
room.</p>

<p>"They're miserable," he said as he slumped down into the chair Jane
had guided him too.  She moved around the table and sat opposite him.</p>

<p>"I know," she said.  Whatever it was the girls were feeling inside
showed through every movement they made, every word they spoke and
even more through every word they left unspoken.  Despondency was
draped around them, greeting you every time you looked at their
faces.  They were like shells of their former selves, hollowed out
waiting for a time when they could come back into themselves without
fear of having their hearts ripped again.</p>

<p>Jane blew out a tired breath, ruffling her hair as she thought about
it.  Every morning they woke up at the same time they always had,
they put on the same clothes they had put on countless numbers of
times before, applied the same make up to the same places as they
always had, and they ate the same breakfasts they always did.  Yet,
despite the sameness of their routine, despite performing the same
activities that had always left them fresh and vibrant and shimmering
with youth and promise, they now looked haggard, fruitless.  Jane
assumed that a large part of that came from the fact that they, or at
least Sam, wasn't sleeping, just tossing and turning or wandering
around the room like a ghost.  It gave them the looks of those abused
puppies in humane shelter commercials.  There was a constant cloud
over them, a gaping darkness sucking at them and those that
surrounded them.  They had come to embody misery, dejection and
melancholy.  They did not wear tragedy masks, they didn't need to,
their actual faces were doing quite well of their own.</p>

<p>"They were talking in the kitchen a few nights ago," Mike
revealed.  "I listened," this was said in a softer, almost apologetic
tone.  He sounded guilty and Jane knew how he felt, they were guilty
of the same thing, partners in life and crime.  "I don't know what to
think.  They sounded so sincere.  No artifice, no theatrics, just raw
emotions, for no ones consumption but their own…or so they thought."</p>

<p>"What did you hear?" Jane asked leaning forward slightly, resting her
elbows on the table.</p>

<p>"Gentleness, concern, comfort, declarations of undying love, begging,
fear.  I heard a truth I could have blissfully ignored," he responded
thoughtfully, his voice sounding far away. "I hesitate to call it
love because of some antiquated notions I can't quite seem to get out
of my head, but I do believe that…that they care deeply about each
other."</p>

<p>"I asked Sam," Jane said a moment after Mike finished speaking, "what
I was suppose to do about this," she continued folding and unfolding
her hands.  "She told me nothing…short of sending one of them to
another country."</p>

<p>"That night, Brooke said not even that would be enough," Mike
interjected scratching his chin.</p>

<p>"I don't know about you…but I believe them," Jane responded, the last
part of her comment coming out in a half laugh, half moan.  The
ludicrousness of the situation, the utter improbability of a
condition like this one developing, momentarily overwhelming her.  If
she weren't so completely depressed by the circumstances she would
have found it terribly amusing.</p>

<p>"Me too," Mike responded, a dark bark of laughter following the
admission.  He shook his head and scratched his chin again.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" Jane asked rubbing the corner of her left
eye.  How many times had they asked each other this question?  How
many times had they wrung their hands, and shaken their heads trying
to answer this one little question?  If she had been keeping count,
she would have lost track of it a long time ago.</p>

<p>"What can we do?"  Mike asked haltingly, giving the question the feel
of a semi-formed of idea that reached maturity as it was spoken out
loud.  He had had an epiphany.  What could they do?  Nothing,
nothing, and nothing. </p>

<p>Jane stared at him for a moment a irreverent smile appearing on her
face briefly before she spoke.  "Regulate," she answered
finally.   "Things have been done that can't be reversed.  What we
have to do is … manage," she said choosing the word carefully, "the
resulting situation.  I'm not sending my baby anywhere which leaves…"</p>

<p>"Regulation," Mike supplied closing his eyes.  "Oh lord," he muttered
shaking his head.  "I'll go get some paper and a pen," all the
ingredients needed for a royal decree, "you start thinking about what
our … policy, should be," he continued standing up and moving towards
the door as Jane shot him look.  Why'd he get to be the paper
gatherer?  "Oh, and number ten or so should be that Brooke has to get
rid of that `Pull Up To My Bumper' poster," he continued ignoring the
look Jane was shooting at him. </p>

<p>"The Brady's never had go through this," Jane muttered as she thought
about thinking about criteria for supervising the girls relationship,
and became utterly depressed by her hypotheticals.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Mike said as he started out the door.  "I always
wondered about Greg and Marsha."</p>

<p>All of the lights were out in the palace (otherwise known as the
McQueen/McPherson residence), the only illumination in the whole
house coming from the living room where the television cast of soft
glow about the room.  In the softly lit living room there was a
gathering.  It was a small gathering, but a gathering nonetheless,
informal, the coming together of friends (or at the very least
frienemies).  The two plush leather couches in the room were occupied
by a short-haired blonde girl with harlot red lipstick, and a long
haired blonde girl with a fashionable but not very politically
correct fondness for fur.  They were stretched out on the couches
like reigning monarchs, or lounging goddesses.  The only other seat
in the room, a leather lounge chair was occupied by a short haired
brunette (who was surprising spry as the others found out in the foot
race for the open chair) which meant that the other occupants of the
room where relegated to the floor.  </p>

<p>A blonde with hair that hung just below her shoulder sat with her
back propped up against the couch the short-haired golden goddess was
currently occupying.  Her legs were stretched out in front of her,
positioned closely together so that they formed a pillow for the head
of the luscious, long-haired brunette who was laying by her.  The two
of them, who occasionally bestowed each other with tender glances and
whispered words, were the picture of domestic bliss.</p>

<p>Another brunette girl sat cross legged off to the left of the goddess
and picture of domestic bliss.  She was sitting close to the fur-
wearer, but not too close.  She seemed uneasy and kept sending
anxious looks behind her to the fur-wearer who would then grin at her
in a highly unsettling manner.</p>

<p>Next to the spry brunette in the chair sat a handsome young man with
dark hair and soulful eyes.  He sat leaned up against the side of the
chair and could occasionally be seen casting longing though resigned
looks to the picture of domestic bliss.</p>

<p>To anyone observing the scene from the outside it would have seemed
like a quaint little scene indeed.  Imbued with sugar and spice and
nostalgia and all of those good things.  It would have seemed like
quite a charming little scene.  But things always look different from
the outside.</p>

<p>Inside:</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Harrison asked peevishly turning to glare at
Nicole, even though he could barely make out her figure in the dark
of the room.  "Stop that!"  He demanded when she didn't cease her
actions immediately.  She was fast forwarding through the parts of
the movie she deemed too boring to sit through, and he had had enough
of it.  They had missed every part of the movie where Brad Pitt
wasn't on screen.  "Give me the remote!" He demanded.</p>

<p>"Make me," Nicole responded elevating a cocky eyebrow at him.  A
challenge.  Nicole Julian didn't take orders.  If you wanted
something she had, you had to take it.</p>

<p>"Give it!"  Harrison demanded again.  Oh, how it hated this girl.  He
hated her even more than he hated Mary Cherry — and that was a
considerable statement considering that Mary Cherry, despite having
known him for almost a year, referred to him as Joe for some insane
reason.</p>

<p>"Since you obviously haven't figured this out yet, let me explain it
to you in simpler terms.  You're the Jimmy Olsen in this equation,
that means that you sit there and be grateful that I'm letting you
bask in my radiance," Nicole responded unfazed.  The silly boy
thought that yelling would intimidate her.  Laughable, pitiful.</p>

<p>"GIVE ME THE REMOTE YOU SOULLESS HARPY!" Harrison yelled at her in
response.  Just once he wanted to be Superman, he was tired of being
Jimmy Olsen.  Jimmy Olsen never got the girl.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you be obsessing over some girl that would rather date
your mother?" Nicole asked tauntingly, smiling wickedly at him as the
words left her mouth.  She was so bad.  She was utterly delicious.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Harrison, Brooke and Sam all exclaimed at once.  This only
made Nicole's smile widen.  Yah, for her, that was a three for one,
very rare indeed.</p>

<p>"I've got the perfect solution," Brooke said reaching up from her
position on the floor and yanking the remote out of Nicole's hand – a
move that becomes particularly impressive when it is noted that she
barely jostled Sam's head as she ripped the remote away from her
friend.  "Both of you, don't speak," she continued pressing the
rewind button.  The movie was called "A River Runs Through It" after
all yet Brooke hadn't spotted the river yet.  All they had seen was
shirtless Brad Pitt – not that that was a bad thing at all, Brooke
just felt that they were selling themselves short by looking at
nothing but naked man flesh.</p>

<p>"I…"</p>

<p>"No!  Don't speak," Brooke exclaimed again holding up her hand and
wiggling her finger  effectively cutting off Nicole's response.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Can I please get the end of the couch?" Carmen asked Mary Cherry.
Mary Cherry's response was to simply stare at her, and rather
apathetically at that.  "My ass has gone numb," Carmen explained
trying to appeal to Mary Cherry's heart, when she received no
response from the other girl.  This was her mistake, for Mary Cherry
had a heart condition…she doesn't have one. </p>

<p>"Let me think about that fer a minute," Mary Cherry responded tilting
her head up to the ceiling thoughtfully.  "After conversing my mah
lord and savoir Jesus Christ, I'm afraid I have ta reply in the
negatory," the blonde continued a moment later.</p>

<p>"Why?" Carmen asked.</p>

<p>"He don't want yer fat ass crinkling this gorgeous buckskin couch
anymore than I do," Mary Cherry responded plainly.  "We're agreed
that it'd be a terrible tragedy."  With that out of the she promptly
yawned and turned away from the gaping brunette.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Carmen called out indignantly.</p>

<p>Brooke turned her attention from Sam – who had interrupted her
feuding with Nicole to protest the harsh treatment her head was
receiving – and looked over to where Carmen and Mary Cherry were
situated.  She winced, this wasn't likely to be pleasant.</p>

<p>"Children please," Brooke said, though she was looking directly at
Mary Cherry as she spoke.  "Didn't anybody teach you how to play with
others.  Sharing is the first step in forming if not a lasting, than
at least a non-combative relationship."</p>

<p>"She started it," Carmen and Mary Cherry responded simultaneously
pointing at each other.  Brooke sighed.  This was a mistake, she
never should have gathered this group of people together in a
combined space.  It was one of the pitfalls of being a dreamer, she
was hopelessly optimistic.  Sometimes it paid off, other times it
slapped her upside the head.  </p>

<p>"I'll go," Mary Cherry said a second later, "if I can share with Lil'
Lily," she continued grinning at the alarmed looking brunette across
the room.</p>

<p>"No," Lily said.  "No way," she continued getting more
agitated.  "No," she went on her voice taking on a horrified quality.</p>

<p>Brooke looked down at a grinning Sam who mouthed to her `I told you
so' then continued to chuckle.  Brooke watched her highly amused
girlfriend with a scowl, how could a loved one take so much joy in
her pain.  Turning her attention from Sam momentarily Brooke looked
up in time to hear Lily yell "why does everything have to come back
to your ass!" at Carmen who yelled back "what kind of vegetarian hogs
a LEATHER couch?  Newsflash, that comfy piece of furniture ain't made
out of Tofu!"</p>

<p>Looking down Brooke saw Sam watching her, a gentle smile playing
across her lips, and she shrugged her shoulders and leaned back
against the couch happily.  Sam lifted her head up at this and
rearranged her position so that she was sitting beside Brooke and
rested her head on the blonde's shoulder as the cheerleader wrapped
her arm around the brunette's waist while whispering in her ear, "I
guess it's true, what they say about good intentions".</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"What's that sound?" Jane asked as they entered the house.  Most of
the lights were off, but they seen a faint light coming from the
living room.  This was the first night she and Mike had gone out seen
learning about the girls relationship.  After having laid down the
ground rules—which they had an absolute aneurysm coming up with—they
had finally realized that sooner or later they were going to have to
leave Brooke and Sam alone together at some point, so the night
before they had grandly announced that they had theatre tickets and
that the girls would have the house to themselves.  However, in a
thoughtful gesture—perhaps having spotted the cold sweat they had
entered while making the announcement—the girls had responded by
asking if it was okay if they had a few people over.  Mike and Jane
nodded vigorously in agreement to this, warmed by the girls
sensitivity and delicacy, believing that the offer was an olive
branch signaling that the girls realized what an unusual and
confusing situation they were all in.  But that's what they thought.
The truth was—and it was a truth that they didn't particularly need
to know—that Brooke and Sam had made this grand gesture knowing that,
even though they had been living like nuns for weeks, they would not
be able to have intimate relations knowing that their parents knew
they were having intimate relations.  They simply wouldn't have been
able to perform, as it were, under those circumstances, they were
psychologically blocked.  This made acting mature and philanthropic
much, much easier for them.</p>

<p>"It sounds like grunting," Mike responded scowling.</p>

<p>Slowly they made their way towards the living room, glancing inside
somewhat hesitantly.  The noise they had heard was indeed grunting
and looking at the occupants of the room they now knew the source of
it.  Mary Cherry had Carmen in a head lock, and because of this
Carmen was grunting trying to free her cranium from Mary Cherry's
tyrannical grasps.  In response Mary Cherry grinned and was singing a
song that sounded like "Baby-back, Baby-back, Baby-back riiiiiibs."
Whatever that meant.</p>

<p>On the other side of the room Lily was sitting in the recliner like a
centurion.  She was holding the fire-poker in a death grip, her eyes
trained on Mary Cherry.  Every once in a while she would make a
poking gesture, as if to tell the occupants of the room that she
wasn't just holding the poker, she knew how to use it, before
focusing on Mary Cherry once again with an almost homicidal intensity.</p>

<p>Nicole and Harrison were off by themselves, circling the coffee like
a pair rabid dogs.  From his vantage point Mike was ninety percent
sure that Nicole had her teeth bared and that Harrison was foaming at
the mouth slightly.  In the center of the coffee table lay the
remote, and every couple of seconds on of them would reach for it
only to have their hand clawed at by the other.  They would then draw
the wounded appendage back towards their bodies and growl before
beginning to circle the table once more.  Mike was almost certain he
had seen this before on the discovery channel only it had been with
baby Pandas.</p>

<p>And finally Brooke and Sam were by themselves sitting on the floor in
front of the larger of the two leather couches.  Sam was sitting in
between Brooke's legs with her knees drawn up serving as a sort of
desk for a notepad that Brooke was pointing and gesturing at
emphatically.</p>

<p>Mike and Jane turned to look at each other.  What the…  </p>

<p>"See, it's clever."  The parents turned when they heard Brooke's
voice.  They had been frozen in position by the utter strangeness of
the scene they walked in on, and they were now unable to remove
themselves.  They were fascinated, and Mike thought that the little
bit they had seen was much better than `The Vaginal Monologues' and
he wasn't even paying to watch this.</p>

<p>"There's nothing there," Sam said looking at the notebook Brooke had
been pointing to before.  Her voice was calm and soothing, as if
speaking to a small child.</p>

<p> "That's it exactly.  That's the point," Brooke exclaimed happily,
glad that Sam finally seemed to have caught on.  "That's why its
significant," she continued dramatically resting her case.</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean anything," Sam insisted.  Jane thought that she saw
Sam smirk as she said this, but she couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>"But it does," Brooke responded petulantly.  "It's a very significant
statement.  Without you my life would be a font of nothing.  That's a
very significant statement," she repeated at a loss for what else to
say.   "And clever," she added at the last minute.  </p>

<p>Sam responded to this by gently taking the unused pen out of Brooke's
hand and patting the appendage patronizingly before beginning to
write something in the notebook.  Brooke watched all of this with a
pout on her face, her head hanging in mopey, hang doggish way, but
she said nothing.  She was certain that in the end she would be
vindicated and it would be proved that `font of nothing' was indeed
brilliant.</p>

<p>"I like this better," Sam said finally as she pointed to the piece of
paper.</p>

<p>"Life without you would be like a broken pencil," Brooke read aloud
with an incredulous expression on her face.  "The fuck?" she asked
looking over at Sam.  Mike scowled some more when he heard this, his
baby sure had grown up fast.</p>

<p>"A broken pencil is completely pointless.  It's got this one purpose
on earth and it can no longer fulfill it.  It's an object without a
function, it represents a life without meaning," Sam responded
helpfully in a rather scholarly tone.</p>

<p>"That's the exact same thing as a font of nothing!" Brooke exclaimed
in a agitated tone.  Sam turned to look back at her girlfriend, her
face was red, she was all flustered.  Brooke looked at her blinking,
her lips quivering slightly.  She looked like a puppy who'd had their
favorite chew toy taken away.  Sam was immediately contrite.</p>

<p>"I was just rompin'," Sam responded gently.  She was helpless to
resist Brooke when she was all flustered and doe eyed and utterly
precious.  Iced tea, a dollar fifty-nine.  Lava Lamp, sixty-four
dollars.  Bonsai tree that dies three days later, fifty-dollars.
Brooke all flustered and precious, priceless.  "A font of nothing is
brilliant," she continued taking Brooke's hand into hers.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," Brooke responded somewhat pacified by Sam's
change of heart.  Sometimes she thought that brunette tried to get
her all flustered on purpose.  "Look, now I'm all agitated," she
continued dropping her head down to rest on Sam's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Poor baby," Sam responded placing a kiss on the top of Brooke's head.</p>

<p>"Poor baby," Brooke mumbled piteously into Sam's shoulder.  However,
despite her tone there was a smile on her face and she pressed a
brief kiss to the side of Sam's neck</p>

<p>"Mamma knows child, mamma knows," Sam responded shifting slightly so
that she could see Brooke's face.</p>

<p>"Font of nothing," Brooke mumbled.  Sam observed her for a second
with a smile on her face.  Life without her certainly would have been
a font of nothing.  Wiping such depressing thoughts from her head she
leaned forward and brought their lips together kissing Brooke
chastely on the lips.  </p>

<p>When they broke apart Brooke sent Sam a big goofy smile, and Sam
smiled back at her with the same sappy-ass expression.  After the
cavity inducing moment, Brooke then, still grinning, playfully walked
her fingers up Sam's side.  "Brooke, no.  No.  Brooke!" Sam said
pleadingly, but it was not use, the blonde started tickling her
anyway.  Soon Sam was reduced a wiggling pile of flesh in Brooke's
arms alternately laughing and pouting while the blonde hugged and
prodded her happy as a lark.</p>

<p>At this Mike and Jane managed to tear themselves away from the scene
in front of them and continued down the hallway to the stairs.  They
were quiet as they made their way up the stairs and across the
landing to their bedroom, each occupying their own vista of
contemplation, though they were considering the same subject.  As
they passed the guest bedroom — now Sam's permanent residence, a fate
the brunette had come to grudgingly accept — she shook her head.  She
supposed that all things considered the new arrangement in the house
was working out adequately.  However, lord knew dinner parties were
going to be a bitch!</p>

<p>"That was…" Mike said trailing off, shrugging his shoulders
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Yep," Jane agreed smiling.  "But if you think things are crazy now,"
she continued sitting down and the bed and taking off her
stockings, "you just wait until they find out I'm pregnant."</p>
