<p>Brooke gazed out the window, the events of the last half hour playing
through her mind over and over again torturously, like a broken record.  She
could still feel the warmth of Sam's body against her, trying to repel her,
hating her with every breath and every tear.  She could still feel Sam's
heartache through her slightly damp collar, breaking her heart again as she
fingered the wet material.  She raised her fingers to her lips and traced
them gently, they were still slightly bruised.  Moments after she had
stopped struggling Sam had raised her head, tears still streaming down her
face, and kissed Brooke with an almost savage intensity, as if she were
testing the blonde and punishing her at the same time.  As their lips
crashed together painfully Brooke had tightened the hold she had on Sam,
taking her punishment gracefully, even gratefully, softly stroking Sam's
cheek as she kissed her, for even in that package Brooke realized what the
kiss was, salvation.  Sam was going to forgive her, and finally she could
breathe again.</p>

<p>Now, Brooke stood in front of the window trying to find an answer, no,
trying to work up the courage to give the answers to Sam that she knew she
had to.  The questions Sam asked, teary eyed and pale, needed to be
answered, the issues addressed.  Brooke knew this, she just dreaded it.  She
had just gotten Sam back and now she had to tell her everything that could
push her away again.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Brooke said finally, running her hand through her hair again
as she remained looking out the window.  "I just got scared," she continued
turning around to face Sam plaintively.  "I've spent my entire life living
inside the box.  No, living inside the box inside the box.  You don't become
popular by being different, you find out what the model is and then you
shape yourself to it…and once you get there, you're comfortable, and all you
have to do is tow the line to stay in."</p>

<p>"And you worked hard to get there?" Sam asked although it was really more of
a statement.  "And Nicole threatened to take it away?" she asked in the same
tone, her eyes flittering away from Brooke's.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," was Brooke's reply.  Sam already  knew the answers
to the questions she asked so there was no need to address them directly.
"It's all that I knew in life and all that I'd ever needed to know.  I'm
popular Sam, it's what I do…it's what I am," she continued.  Sam looked away
from her and flopped down onto the bed.  "It's all I've ever been…for better
or for worse."</p>

<p>"So why are you here?" the brunette asked finally.  Her voice was a bit more
cutting than she had intended, but she couldn't really help the antagonistic
feelings that had been brought up by Brooke's little sermon.  Everything the
blonde had just said were reasons why Sam had denied what she had felt for
her in the first place.  When the plebeians mixed with the patricians
disaster always resulted.  Brooke was royalty that had consorted with the
peasant stock and was now threatened with being disinherited. This was a
proposition that Sam had never seen end well, inevitably social friction
always tore the lovers apart and Sam was dreading that that was what was
happening to them.  Rubbing at her eyes she wasn't sure who she was more
angry at, herself for falling for Brooke, or Brooke for being Brooke.</p>

<p>Brooke sighed heavily before responding.  "All popularity has gotten me is
an eating disorder, an inferiority complex, chronic indecisiveness-because
we can only be independent thinkers if everyone else is-a clan of psychotic
backstabbers for friends, and at times a kind of bipolar personality that
really is beginning to worry me," Brooke responded crossing over to where
Sam was sitting and kneeling down on the floor in front of her.  "That's
option A.  Option B, starts with an 'S', ends with an 'M' and has an 'A' in
the middle, which in the circle that is me spells unimaginable happiness,"
she continued resting her head in Sam's lap tentatively, then relaxing once
the overture wasn't rejected.  "Now, you'll have to excuse me because I am
blonde *and* a cheerleader…but eventually it became clear to me that there
really wasn't a choice at all."</p>

<p>Sam trailed her fingers through Brooke's hair as she spoke, before trailing
her hands along Brooke's jaw line and under her chin tilting her head up so
that Sam could look into her eyes.  From that position she bent her head
down and fleetingly pressed their lips together, her body flooding with
relief.  She could've told herself over and over again that Brooke was no
good for her and she was no good for Brooke, but she had tried that earlier
on and now knew for a fact that it just didn't do any good.  Even though
their relationship was riddled with problems the size of planetoids they
were in love, and that meant that nothing else really mattered, which
sometimes meant that they were going to fucked up the ass with a chainsaw
every now and then, but mostly meant that they were happy.</p>

<p>"So now what?" she asked looking down at Brooke once they separated.  Her
eyes were searching the blonde's, looking for clues as to where she really
was, what she was feeling under their fuzzy pink feelings for each other.
"We headline?"</p>

<p>"I would prefer not to," Brooke responded her eyes traveling the contours of
the ceiling.  Despite her declarations she was still trying to deal with the
entire situation.  She just didn't know if she was strong enough to endure
the whispers and the looks, she just couldn't fathom what it would be like
not to be admired.</p>

<p>"I know you don't want to go from pin-up to poster girl," Sam responded
knowingly,  "it just sounds like Nicole's taken that option away," she
observed more soberly.  "I only see three options: we can be outted…as it
were, we can be out," she said placing emphasis on that one, "or we can be
over," she finished softly.</p>

<p>Brooke looked over that Sam intensely after she finished speaking, watching
her for a moment.  "That's not an option," she said softly in response to
Sam's last statement.  "And the other two don't necessarily need to be
either," she continued thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Sam watched Brooke carefully, there were so many emotions floating across
her features that the brunette couldn't keep track of them.  She would have
asked what Brooke was thinking, but she wasn't really confident that the
blonde had any more of an idea what was going through her head than Sam did.
  "What do you mean?" she asked deciding to concentrate on the small picture
of the moment.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to her, maybe convince her not to do this," Brooke said
softly.  "I know you all think she's some evil demon spawn, but there's more
to her than nice hair and biting one liners, I've seen it.  If I can get at
that part of her, the part that's been my friend then…" Brooke trailed off
knowing the rest of the sentence would come to Sam intuitively.</p>

<p>"And if not?" Sam asked gently.  She could tell that it was a painful
subject for Brooke, that the cheerleader wanted to believe that her friend
wouldn't sell her out, but she also heard a kind of dubious tone in Brooke's
voice, as if she wasn't completely confident that she could convince Nicole
herself.</p>

<p>"If not, then it comes down to this:  It's all about being popular, Nicole
thinks that if this gets out I'll be dethroned and she can take over as
Princess of Candyland, and she's probably right," Brooke started
thoughtfully, pushing her more sentimental feeling to the side.  "But as
much as Nicole knows my secret I know hers," she continued a somewhat
haunted look taking over her features.  "So, it becomes a matter of whose
secret is more scandalous, and whether or not she's willing to let hers out
to out us," she concluded.</p>

<p>"I see you didn't go all of those years without picking something up from
her," Sam responded softly as she ran her fingers through Brooke's hair
soothingly.  "What did she do?  Steal money from a homeless shelter?"
Whatever it was would have to be huge, since gayness was a pretty big deal.</p>

<p>Brooke beckoned Sam to lean down, then whispered something in her ear.</p>

<p>"Ohmygod!" Sam exclaimed, her lips curving into a smile, then her brows
scrunching together before being followed by a look of revulsion but also
fascination.  "Are you serious?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Brooke responded, slightly amused by the expressions on Sam's
face.  She must have looked the exact same way when she found out.  It was
an oddly fascinating tale, even though you kind of felt bad for being
intrigued by it.</p>

<p>"That'll do it," Sam replied sobering up a bit.  "That'll definitely do it."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke agreed resting her head against Sam's thigh wearily.  "I just
hope it doesn't have to come down to that."</p>

<p>"She means a lot to you, doesn't she?" Sam asked running her hand under
Brooke's chin and tilting her head up so that they were looking at each
other.  Brooke merely lowered her eyes, confirming Sam's question silently.
  "Sometimes," Sam said a moment later, "we don't always get what we
want…but if we try, sometimes we just might find we'll get what we need."</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a minute than smiled.  "And sometimes, we can't get no
sa-tis-faction," she replied breaking out into a full fledged grin.  Nothing
cheered her up more than words of wisdom for the Rolling Stones, actually
ice-cream did, but this was good too.</p>

<p>Sam looked down at her for a moment after than, a soft smile playing across
her features as she watched Brooke seem marginally happy for the first time
in days.  When the blonde finished laughing, she meet Sam's eyes and the
watched each other for a while in a comfortable silence.  Sam's eyes were
drawn to Brooke's lips after a moment, they were slightly red and puffy, and
she reached out and traced them lightly with thumb.  She had done that to
her she remember sadly.  Sam let in finger fall after a moment and leaned
down bringing their lips together softly, lovingly as if trying to erase the
damage she had done earlier.</p>

<p>Sam rubbed at her finger nervously as she scanned the hallway, left and
right, left and right.  After Brooke had left her room the afternoon before,
Sam had sat down and considered, at length, the reality of their situation
for the first time since she was swept of her feet.  She realized that the
social implications in regards to her were pretty negligible, as a part of
the school newspaper she only ranked just above the audiovisual club in
terms of nerdiness, and was about par with the drama club as far as what
people expected from her socially.  Basically, the reputation she did have
wasn't likely to suffer at the hands of any public exposure of her
relationship with Brooke.  And, with the recent developments in the whole
Nicole situation Sam was fairly certain that that public exposure-which
wouldn't really hurt her socially-would indeed come about.  That being the
case, there was only one thing that she really needed to take care of,
Harrison.  Whatever was going to happen with Nicole, whether good or bad,
was going to happen soon, of that Sam was sure, that meant that she had to
find Harrison and tell him what was going on before he could hear it from
someone else.</p>

<p>Honestly, she wasn't really looking forward to it, which was why she had put
it off for so long.  Harrison's infatuation with Brooke was no secret, the
fact that he was still infatuated with her was no secret, and when he found
out that Sam was sleeping with her, he was most likely not going to react
well to the situation.  Sam's relationship with Brooke wasn't a betrayal of
Harrison because there was nothing between him and cheerleader to betray,
but Sam knew that he wouldn't see it that way.  Still, he was going to find
out sooner or later, and it was better that it come from her no matter how
he reacted to the news.</p>

<p>So there she was, scanning the hallway for her friend so that she could
smash his heart into a million pieces.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam greeted sidling up to Harrison as he made is way down the hall.</p>

<p>"Where'd you come from?"</p>

<p>"Around the corner.  I was stalking you," Sam responded.</p>

<p>"I get that a lot," Harrison replied nodding along.  "What's up?"</p>

<p>"No idle chit chat with you huh?" Sam asked rubbing the back of her neck.
"Truthfully, I need to talk to you," she continued drawing up her courage,
lord knew she would need it.</p>

<p>"Sounds serious," Harrison commented observing her keenly.  She was nervous,
very nervous, that worried him because Sam wasn't easily unnerved.</p>

<p>"It is," Sam confirmed, she could feel her stomach tightening up and had to
pause for a moment to concentrate on breathing.  She was suddenly very glad
that Carmyn and Lily had saved her the trouble of having to go through this
with them, it was nerve racking as hell, and she hadn't even gotten to the
juicy innards yet.  "I don't want to talk about it here…are you free later?"</p>

<p>"I think my schedules clean, when and where?" he asked intensely curious
what she could possibly have to say to him.</p>

<p>"My house…no…yeah…um…no…wait, yeah," Sam responded haltingly.  "Yeah, my
house, around three, nobody should be home then," she finished.</p>

<p>"Alright, it's a date," responded checking his watch.  "Gotta jet, one more
late and they toss me in the dungeon," he continued speeding up and making
his way down the hall.</p>

<p>"In civilized society we call it detention," Sam called after him before
turning around and letting out a deep sigh, that was spectacularly
disappointing.  She didn't even want to think about what kind of reserves
she was going to have call up to make it through the actual conversation.</p>

<p>"Do you want something to drink?  I could get you something to drink?  We
have cold drinks…there's…"</p>

<p>"It's okay, I'm good," Harrison said holding up his hand effectively cutting
off Sam's manic speech.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?  I could get you something to eat…"</p>

<p>"Really, Sam, I'm fine.  Take it easy, you look like you're about to rupture
something," he said, starting to get concerned about why she wanted to talk
to him.  This wasn't at all in character-not counting her recent bouts of
weirdness.</p>

<p>"Sorry.  I'm just a bit stressed.  I'm tense, I mean my back's all
knotted…it's not pleasant," she replied rubbing at the back of her neck
anxiously once again.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I caught on to that whole anxiety thing,"  he responded softly.  "Why
don't you just tell me what's on your mind, and maybe we'll both feel
better, because quite frankly you're kind freaking me out here."</p>

<p>"Right," Sam said sitting down on the couch then immediately standing back
up again.  "I don't know if you've noticed, but lately I've been rather…"</p>

<p>"Crazy?"</p>

<p>"Not the word I would've gone with, but essentially," Sam responded frowning
slightly.  "Well it's kind of because I've got this thing."</p>

<p>"Thing?" Harrison asked only vaguely following her.  "What like a growth?
Oh my god is it a brain tumor?" He had heard that brain tumors often caused
odd behavior in people due to the way they pressed on the brain.</p>

<p>"No!  No.  I don't have a tumor or a growth, by thing I meant that I have
got this…relationship," Sam said slightly unnerved by his exclamation.</p>

<p>"Relationship?  Ohhh, get down with your bad-self," he responded making
sound cheap porno sounds and doing a little dance.</p>

<p>"Right, the only thing is it's not that simple," she went on running a hand
through her hair.  "It's not…a conventional relationship."</p>

<p>"Why is he like shorter than you?" Harrison asked.  It pained Sam to no end
that he asked the question with the utmost sincerity.  If he had at least
been meeting her half way it would have all been okay, but no, he had choose
today to lose his brain.</p>

<p>"No! I mean…he's a she," Sam blurted out.  That was necessary, if she didn't
just say it was never going to get said.</p>

<p>"A girl?" Harrison asked staring at her unblinkingly.  "You're dating a
girl?…in a gay way?"</p>

<p>"That's kind of how it works," Sam confirmed.</p>

<p>"Is anybody in this town still straight?" he asked throwing his hands up in
the air dramatically.  "At least you caught it young," he continued turning
back around so that he was facing Sam.</p>

<p>"That's true," Sam responded more for the sake of saying something than
anything else.</p>

<p>"You know what this is fantastic, I can't believe it.  YOU, can get a
girlfriend and I can't," he went on.  "Where's the justice in that?  She's
probably gorgeous too, isn't she?  She's hot right?"</p>

<p>"I…" Sam started caught off guard by his reaction, "yeah."</p>

<p>"I thought as much, that would complete the circle," Harrison responded
shaking his head dejectedly.  There was no justice in the world, he was sure
of that now.  "If she models for Victoria's secret I'm moving to a deserted
island and dedicating my life to the study of exotic birds and fauna," he
went on pacing the room.  "Do I know her?" he asked finally stopping.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded.</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to tell me, or are we playing twenty-questions?" he
asked looking at her expectantly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that was kind of the point of asking you here," Sam responded
stalling for time.</p>

<p>"Okay, then.  Who?" he was actually intensely curious as to who it could be.</p>

<p>Sam paused, her ears were ringing and she was fairly certain that she was
shaking.  This was the moment of truth and she felt like she was going to
pass out.  "Brooke."  She knew that she opened her mouth and that she had
spoken, but she couldn't remember hearing the word actually come out of her
mouth.  If it wasn't for the instantaneous reaction on Harrison's mouth, she
might have thought that she hadn't really said it at all.</p>

<p>"What?" he practically chocked out.  He felt like his heart had stopped
beating, the second Brooke's name came out of Sam's mouth it was like a
complete suspension of his existence.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam repeated, her voice was stronger this time, it was almost as
if the mention of her lovers name had infused her with some badly needed
backbone.  "I'm seeing Brooke."</p>

<p>"Brooke McQueen?" Harrison asked dumbly.  His head was pounding, and his
vision was blurring.</p>

<p>"Brooke McQueen," Sam confirmed watching him sadly.  She had never wanted to
hurt him, but she had no choice in the matter, her heart had made her
decision for her and there was no turning back.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked finally flopping down onto the couch.  His voice wavering
with an emotion Sam couldn't readily identify.</p>

<p>"Why?" the brunette asked confused by the question.</p>

<p>"Why her?  Why of all the tens of thousands of teenagers in L.A., of the
thousands of students at our school, why out of all of those people did you
have to pick the one girl I've wanted since I before I even knew what
wanting was?" he asked his voice raising, his hands clutching at the couch
desperately.  Sam thought that she could see tears in his eyes, she took a
step back.</p>

<p>"I didn't pick her," Sam responded softly.  "It wasn't deliberate, I didn't
even know what was happening until it happened and by then it was too late.
I had fallen…and I didn't want to get up."</p>

<p>Harrison didn't respond to her verbally, her merely looked up and over at
her with shimmering eyes, piercing her with his pain.  And she felt it as
acutely as if it were her own, in fact only a day before it had been her own
and she knew how he felt, she more than knew how he felt, and it tore her up
because she knew it was hell.  He was mourning the loss of a love he never
had, like she had been mourning the loss of a love she had barely tasted.
Of the two she wasn't sure what was worse, because if it had been true, that
Brooke had gone back to Josh, at least the brunette could say that she had
loved Brooke and been loved in return and that was something real, something
tangible.  Harrison, he only had a phantom of love, a love Sam knew to be
the sun, and the moon and whole world.</p>

<p>"Sam, you're not gonna believe this…okay, okay, I'm in line at the Pottery
Barn…" Brooke started say coming in the door, emoting before she had even
made it all the way inside.  "Yeah, I know, don't ask.  So I'm in line at
the Pottery Barn and guess who…" the blonde paused as she came to the
threshold of the living room and saw the picture inside.  "Oh," Brooke
commented softly as her eyes darted around the room and she considered the
fastest way to get the hell out of there.</p>

<p>However, just as she was about to make her move and pray for the best Sam
turned her head to look at her, and the moment she saw the expression on her
girlfriends face she knew that she had told Harrison about the two of them.
And, considering the silence that hovered around the room, and the morose
looks on their faces, she knew that it hadn't been roses and sunshine.  She
immediately made her way over to Sam who looked like she was at her breaking
point.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Brooke asked softly as she placed her hand on Sam's shoulder
rubbing it tenderly with her finger.  She was aware of Harrison's eyes on
them, but she was only one person and as such could only deal with one of
them at a time.  Harrison was just going to have to wait his turn.</p>

<p>Sam simply nodded her head, her posture straightening and her eyes clearing
at the feel of Brooke's touch.</p>

<p>Once Brooke was certain that Sam was indeed okay, she turned her head so
that she was looking at Harrison.  He was watching them with one of the most
disparaged expressions she had ever seen.  She had seen the same look on
Josh's face at the golf course a few nights before and it had broken her
heart then.  It still did.</p>

<p>"Harrison," she started to say, but she stopped when he stood up and held up
his hand to her.</p>

<p>"Don't…just don't," he said shaking his head.  "Congratulations…or whatever,
I'm not quite sure what the etiquette for a situation like this is so you'll
have to excuse any faux pas on my part."</p>

<p>"Harrison," Sam tried finally finding her voice.</p>

<p>"No," he said waving his hand still watching them intently.  After Brooke
had came over to Sam, he had noticed his friend move towards her, into her,
almost unconsciously.  When Brooke had first walked over there had been a
small space between them, but that had disappeared imperceptibly leaving Sam
literally in Brooke's arms, where for the first time all day she actually
seemed relaxed.  "I mean it.  Congratulations.  Really."</p>

<p>And with that he turned around and made his way out of the living room, into
the hallway and the door into some much needed fresh air before he
completely lost it.</p>

<p>Harrison sat down in front of the computer and rested his hands on the desk,
pinching the bridge of his nose with his right hand.  He was suppose to edit
the article Sam and he had worked on last week and add captions to the
pictures so that it could be ready to print in the following weeks paper but
he just couldn't seem to do it.  Every time he looked at the article it
reminded him of Sam, and every time he thought of Sam he thought of her and
Brooke, and every time he thought of her and Brooke he became unbelievably
pissed off and it gave him a headache.  When he had left their house a few
days before he had fully intended to be okay with their relationship, but he
found that intentions were easy to hold and hard to achieve.</p>

<p>The thing that really got him was that he could see as plain as day that
they were in love with each other.  He had started watching them with an
almost psychotic interest since he had found out, and that tenderness that
he had observed that day at the house coated their every interaction with
each other.  They reeked of love and the stench was driving him insane.</p>

<p>He was interrupted from his musing only by the sound of a familiar voice
coming from behind him.</p>

<p>"I've given this a lot of consideration and I've decided that your lack of
response to me means one of two things:  Either all of the phones in your
house spontaneously combusted severing all of your contacts to the natural
world, or you're doing a very good job of avoiding me," Sam said steadily as
she walked into the room closing the door behind her.  Harrison had been
avoiding her ever since she had told him about her and Brooke, and while she
was hoping that he would work out whatever he had to work out on his own, it
became clear to her that she had to talk to him.  He was one of her best
friends and she couldn't just leave things the way they were.  She had to at
least try.</p>

<p>"One of those is a winner," Harrison responded removing his hand from his
face but not turning around.</p>

<p>"Can we talk?" Sam asked pulling up a chair beside him and sitting down.</p>

<p>"Isn't that what we're doing?" he asked dismissively.</p>

<p>"Actually I've probably talked more to your mother in the past week than
you," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"I suppose you two would have a lot to talk about," Harrison responded.
"Maybe she could give you some pointers," he continued finally turning
around to face Sam.  His voice was low, his lips set in a hard line and his
eyes accusing.</p>

<p>Sam blinked at him, mildly surprised by the hostility in his voice.  She
wasn't expecting a walk in the park, but she wasn't expecting an outright
attack either.  She wasn't sure who should be more insulted, her or his
mother.  However, since she was the only one of the two present in the room
she decided that she had to represent.</p>

<p>"That was low," she responded softly, turning away from his accusing eyes.
"I know that you're having a hard time with this, I just thought that after
playing together since we were in jumpers, we might be able to have a civil
conversation."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't you be at the pep rally ogling the cheerleaders?" Harrison
responded after a moment turning back around so that he was facing the
computer screen once again.</p>

<p>Sam considered him for a moment silently.  She could feel her eyes beginning
to burn and blinked back the tears that were forming in her eyes.  She
wasn't going to let him see what he was doing was her.</p>

<p>"I don't need to be at the pep rally," Sam began in a soft voice, "I can see
all or anything of Brooke whenever I want to," she continued in a haughty
tone reacting to his treatment of her, trying to goad him on.</p>

<p>"How positively Greco-Roman of you," Harrison shot back.  "Your parents must
be so proud."</p>

<p>Sam ran her hand through he hair nervously tugging at the strands anxiously
as she watched Harrison stare aimlessly at the computer screen in front of
him.</p>

<p>"Please don't be like this," she said finally.  "I never meant to hurt you,
neither of us did.  What happened between Brooke and I, it took us by
surprise just as much as anyone else.  I mean it's me, Sam, falling for
Brooke was the equivalent of Lily going to a Texas barbeque.  I didn't want
to, I just couldn't help it," she continued with a somewhat pleading tone in
her voice.  She wanted him to understand what was going on, because she knew
with the way he was feeling only complete honesty about the situation could
abate it.  "And I do love her.  Can you understand that?"</p>

<p>"Good for you.  You love her and she loves you.  That's the way to do it,
believe me things work best that way.  But just because you're walking in
some flowery country paradise of bliss, doesn't mean I'm going to get on the
train and join you," Harrison said turning around to face her once again.
"You said you can't help how you feel…well neither can I.  I don't like it,
I don't want you to be with her, and I can't accept that you're with her and
be peppy and excited about.  Can you understand that?"</p>

<p>"So what?  You're saying that we can't be friends anymore?  That the fact
that I'm with Brooke now negates our entire friendship?  Because if that's
what you're saying than no, I can't understand that.  The world's full of
nasty, ignorant people, I know that.  I just never thought that you were one
of them," Sam responded, the tears she had been holding back escaping from
the confines of her eyes and streaking down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Harrison watched her for a moment, tracking the progress of the tears
falling from her eyes.  He felt himself being torn in two different
directions.  There was the part that saw probably his best friend in the
world crying because of him, that wanted to reach out and wipe her tears
away and hug her telling her that he would work it out and that things would
be okay; fighting against the part of him that saw the girl who stole the
girl he had been in love with and at the same time the girl he could have
seen himself falling in love with stolen by the girl he had always wanted to
be in love with him.</p>

<p>In the end, he found that the pain of what could have been outweighed the
rightness of what should be, and he clinched his jaw and turned away from
her.  He guessed that was what he was saying.</p>

<p>Sam watched him for a moment, then stood up quietly and walked out of the
room.  Apparently that's what he was saying.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Sam flung the blankets off of her body and dark out into the dark room.  She
couldn't sleep.  Every time she tried to fade away into unconsciousness her
mind would drift back to the confrontation she'd had with Harrison in the
afternoon and any chance she'd had of falling asleep would immediately
disappear.  She was so tied up in knots that she could barely lay still.
Unconsciously she turned her head toward Brooke's room.  The blonde had been
gone all day on a company yachting trek with Mike's company, which meant
that Sam had been deprived of her presence all day.  She wasn't even sure if
they had gotten back yet.  Checking her clock she saw that it was just past
three and decided that she would go and check.  She didn't know what she was
going to say or do, only that she at least needed to be around Brooke.  The
blonde just had an uncanny ability to cheer her up.</p>

<p>Leaving the doors between her room, the bathroom and Brooke's room open, Sam
slipped into the blonde's room.  Brooke was indeed in her room, lying on her
bed with her hair splayed out across the pillow, the top of her emerald silk
pajamas just visible above the top of her blanket.  Sam watched her for a
moment, a gentle smile playing across her lips, before she approached the
bed and lifted up the edge of the blanket, slipping in beside Brooke.</p>

<p>
Brooke became hazily aware of the feel of a head resting on her chest and an
arm draping around her waist, and lazily she cracked open one sleepy eye.
What she saw was a mess of brown hair resting just above her left breast and
a pale arm strewn across her stomach.  Turning her head to the side slightly
she placed her lips against Sam's forehead kissing her softly.  She couldn't
see it, but somehow she was absolutely certain that the brunette smiled
before burying her head into Brooke's chest even more.</p>

<p>"I can't sleep," Sam mumbled a moment later as Brooke played idly with her
hair, while sporadically placing butterfly kisses all over Sam's face.</p>

<p>"Is the boogie man under your bed again, because Dad said he had taken care
of that," Brooke responded. Her voice was low with sleep, but that couldn't
hide the gently teasing tone that it carried.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately not this time," Sam responded, her voice barely a whisper but
even at that audibly sad.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Brooke asked shifting her position so that she was now
lying on her side facing Sam.  She had been on the verge of falling asleep
again, but the tone of Sam's face woke her up immediately.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," Sam said lowering her head, effectively breaking eye contact
with Brooke.  Brooke watched her for a moment, it was clear as crystal to
her that whatever was going on was most definitely not nothing.</p>

<p>"It's not nothing," Brooke responded softly, reaching out and placing her
hand on Sam's cheek.  "It's got you upset and that makes it most definitely
something."</p>

<p>Sam didn't respond verbally, instead she chose to close the distance that
had formed between them when Brook turned to face her and draw the blonde
towards her once again.  Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam and held her to
her, bringing Sam with her as she lay back down on her back.  They stayed in
that silence for a long time, Brooke tenderly stroking Sam's back as the
brunette hugged her, so long in fact that Brooke began to think that Sam had
fallen asleep.  But, after ten minutes or so the journalist whispered, "I
saw Harrison today."</p>

<p>"What happened?" Brooke asked already knowing that it would be some
variation of 'I got bitch slapped like a two dollar whore in Harlem', from
the way Sam had been acting.</p>

<p>"This is going to sound fairly schoolyard," Sam started, "but he basically
told me that we couldn't be friends anymore."  Despite the sardonic tone
that she used, Brooke could hear the pain behind her words and shifted again
so that she was facing Sam.  Leaning forward she brought their lips together
softly, then placed her lips next to Sam's ear hugging her.</p>

<p>"He just needs some time," Brooke responded benevolently.  However, as the
words left her mouth she was thinking that what Harrison really needed was a
nice hard slap upside the head, and that she was just woman to deliver it.
Truthfully, she had expected more from him, not to mention the fact that
with Nicole still on the warpath she didn't really want anyone else raining
on their parade.  "Try to get some sleep," Brooke continued a moment later
settling Sam against her, "maybe things will look different when the sun
comes up," she went on resolving to talk to Harrison first thing in the
morning.</p>

<p>"Optimism is an attractive characteristic," Sam mumbled into Brooke's
nightshirt.</p>

<p>"Don't I know it.  I'm just full of attractive characteristics.  In fact I'm
fairly certain that if I only had a little humility I'd be perfect," Brooke
responded grinning down at Sam.  The brunette looked up at her with a stern
expression but couldn't keep it up for long soon dissolving into wearing a
stupid grin herself.  She thought that she might finally be able to get some
sleep.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke placed her arm on Josh's shoulder and told him that she would catch
up with him in a moment.  They were on their way to English class, but
Brooke had spotted Harrison just down the hall and made up her mind to talk
to him then, so that he would have enough time to beg and grovel for Sam's
forgiveness later on in the day.  So, having sent Josh on his way, Brooked
stalked over to Harrison who was leaning against his locker talking to Emory
Dick, and said, "Can we talk?"</p>

<p>"I'm busy, but if you leave your name and number I'll get back to you as
soon as possible," Harrison responded without even turning around to face
the blonde cheerleader standing beside him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to sound like a request," Brooke
responded flatly.  "We're going to talk.  Now."</p>

<p>Harrison simply crossed his arms and stared at her.</p>

<p>"Emory, don't you have an elsewhere to be?" Brooke asked pointedly.
"Because now would be a good time to disappear there," she continued when
the small blond boy hesitated to move.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to him like that," Harrison responded stepping in front of
Brooke's face.</p>

<p>"Like you have any right to be giving me etiquette lessons," Brooke
responded stepping right back up in his.</p>

<p>"What's that suppose to mean?" Harrison asked hotly.  Neither one of them
noticed Emory sneak away.</p>

<p>"Just that you could out bitch me any day of the week," Brooke responded.
"Sam could testify to that."</p>

<p>Harrison stared at her for a moment then turned around and started to walk
down the hall.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it get hard?  You know, running away without a spine?" Brooke asked
following him down the hall.  At that he stopped walking and turned around,
his manly pride wounded by her words.</p>

<p>"Fine, you wanna talk, let's talk," Harrison said opening the door to the
janitors closet and waving Brooke inside.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to talk," Brooke said as he closed the door behind them,
"I want to talk and I want you to listen.  If you want to act like a
self-important asshole that's fine with me as long as you're the only one
your stupidity hurts.  Yesterday, it hurt Sam, which makes it no longer
alright with me.  I know how you feel, despite the protests I can see ready
to spring to your lips, I can comprehend what's going through that pea brain
of yours, and to tell you the truth I really don't give a shit.  I don't
want to get to the root of your issues, and I'm not here to give reassurance
to you manly, heterosexual charms.  I'm here to tell you what's what.  I
love Sam, she loves me, and it's going to take a lot more than someone
acting pissy to break us up.  That means that you have one of two choices,
you can yank the stick out of your ass and remain friends with someone who
you probably don't deserve, or you can firmly grasp said stick and fuck
yourself with it by pushing her away.  To most people this would be a no
brainer, but to be perfectly honest you haven't been impressing me with your
intellectual prowess lately."</p>

<p>"Are you finished?" Harrison asked crossing his arms and giving Brooke the
stink-eye.  He couldn't really do anymore than that in response to her
speech since she had been indignant enough for both of them, thus taking the
wind right out of his sails.  Also that fact that she was right played a
little part in it.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm done," Brooke, responded rather pleased with herself.  She was
feeling very commanding today, and decided that she was going to go have her
bitch fight with Nicole after this.</p>

<p>"Good, so am I," he replied opening the door and walking out, a ghost of a
shadow haunting his face as he made his way down the hall and out of sight.</p>

<p>Nicole took a seat on the plush, maroon loveseat in the Novak, rubbing her
thumb and forefinger together deviously, while watching Brooke out the
corner of her eyes.  Something seemed different with the other girl, she had
lost that glow the had had for the last month or so and Nicole began to
wonder if Josh had seriously won her back.  Truthfully she had made the
offer not really thinking it would work, if Brooke was smitten enough Spam
to have actually endangered her social standing by sleeping with her, Nicole
had doubted that she would just dump her like yesterday's news.  Either way,
she was intensely interested to hear what Brooke now had to say.</p>

<p>"I think," Brooke began pacing the length of the room restlessly, "that
we're beyond small talk regarding this particular matter," she continued
wanting to get straight to business.  She doubted it would be pleasant
whether it took them an hour or a minute to get down to it, and frankly her
heart couldn't handle an hour.</p>

<p>"What particular matter would this particular matter be?" Nicole asked
smiling sweetly at the other girl.  She wondered what had taken Brooke so
long, after the scene in the cafeteria she had expected to have a little
chat with Brooke, however the blonde disappeared for the rest of day.</p>

<p>"My relationship with Sam," Brooke responded meeting Nicole's gaze.</p>

<p>"I was under the impression that that had passed," Nicole responded.</p>

<p>"It hasn't," Brooke responded meeting Nicole's gaze with a steely one of her
own.  "I could say more, but I don't think it's necessary.  The reason I
asked you to come here is because I know what you're planning to do."</p>

<p>"Planning to do?  What are you talking about?" Nicole drawled lazily.  She
was at least pleased to hear that she hadn't wasted the years she had spent
under Brooke, over that period of time she had learned to read the other
girl like a children's novel.  Brooke, so nice, so bloody predictable.</p>

<p>"I'm talking about you outing us," Brooke responded simply.  She wasn't
going to play these word games with Nicole, she didn't have the time or the
inclination.  The brutal honesty of the statement caused Nicole to stop
inspecting her fingernails and look over at the girl standing in front of
her.  So Brooke could still surprise her every now and then, that didn't
mean anything.</p>

<p>"Outing is such a harsh word," Nicole responded carefully.  "I prefer to
think of it as spreading the good news.  What ever happened to singing it
from the mountain tops, Brooke?"</p>

<p>"You can think of it however you 'prefer' to, it doesn't change what it is,"
Brooke responded solemnly.  "Please Nic, don't do this."</p>

<p>"You're the one that did the doing, Brookie," Nicole responded.  "You knew
what it would mean and you fucked her anyway.  I hope it was good Brooke,
cause you'll be suffering from the consequences of that indulgence for a
while.  Basically, you're screwed."</p>

<p>"It doesn't have to be this way," Brooke said a pleading tone entering her
voice.  "You're suppose to be my friend…my best friend, I never thought
you'd stab me the moment I turned my back to you."</p>

<p>"Never turn your back to anyone Brooke, especially not to someone like me,"
Nicole responded her tone darkening.  "I'm no good.  People have been
telling you that for years.  But you never believed them, did you?  Even
when you saw me rip through people without breaking a sweat.  That's what I
loved about you Brookie, your unwavering faith.  But a cheetah can't hide
her spots forever, and now you're finally having to connect the dots.  You
were convenient, now you're a liability.  On the African plains when a
member of the tribe becomes weak the others leave them to die, then rip them
shreds…so the strong can survive.  You're reign is over…your most stunning
defeat by your own tongue," Nicole finished as she circled Brooke.  She was
like a vulture circling her pray in the hot desert sun, taking little
nibbles at it before died.</p>

<p>"Nicole…"</p>

<p>"What?  You think I don't mean it?" Nicole asked her voice raising slightly.
  "I'm tired of being your lap dog.  Someone would have tore you apart years
ago if it wasn't for me.  Christ, Mary Cherry has got more balls than you
do.  That girl would kill, literally, for what you've got, and you piss and
moan it away.  Well, you're on your own this time, you've engineered your
own defeat.  This time it's all on you, because the only thing I've got on
my side is the truth.  And if that's what you're scared of, then you've got
bigger problems then me."</p>

<p>Brooke simply stared at the girl once she finished speaking, her head was
pounding and she found herself falling into a nearby chair.  Under the
hostility, and the snide-ness and the Darwinian logic, Nicole had a point.
There was a bigger issue there than the betrayal of confidence that Brooke
had been focusing on.  This wasn't an issue of Nicole merely threatening to
tell her secret, it was a case of her being ashamed of her secret.  Nicole
was right, the truth was that Brooke was dating Sam, that they loved each
other and that Brooke was absolutely terrified of the population at large
finding out about it.  The only thing that gave Nicole power in this
situation was their fear, her fear.</p>

<p>Intellectually, Brooke had always known that was underlying principle behind
it all; that being involved with Sam would have a slew of after effects that
wouldn't be nearly as pleasurable as the fact that they were together.  And
sitting there in the washroom of her school with Nicole staring down at her
like some predator from the safari, Brooke was painfully aware of all of the
reasons she wanted to keep the relationship a secret, and alternately of all
the reasons she felt terribly ashamed for feeling ashamed of what she and
Sam had together.</p>

<p>Nicole was right, Brooke did have bigger problems than her, and Brooke had
no idea what to do about them.</p>

<p>"I love her," Brooke breathed out wretchedly as she squeezed her eyes shut
trying to hold in the tears threatening to fall.  "Why can't that be
enough?"  She wasn't sure who she was talking to, herself of Nicole.</p>

<p>"Because it's not," Nicole answered softly.  The malevolence so prevalent in
her previous sermon had dissipated as a result of Brooke's collapse and
uttered declarations.  Despite herself Nicole was moved by the display.  She
could see Brooke tearing herself apart, digging into herself and bleeding.
It was oddly compelling, seeing her fall apart like, seeing her disassemble
right before her own eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," Brooke continued, as the tears she had tried so
valiantly to hold escaped from their prison and cascaded down her cheeks.
"I love her so much I almost can't remember what it was like before we were
together…but being with her is killing everything that I know.  Sometimes,
it hurts so much and I get so scared that I can't breath…but I can't stop
feeling how I feel.  Even though it's ruining me, I can't stop loving her,"
she concluded, looking up at Nicole with luminescent tear filled eyes.</p>

<p>Nicole watched Brooke disassemble even further after that, could see her
crumbling in front of her eyes until all that she could make out of the girl
was a mass of quivering, wet flesh.  She turned away.  This was opportunity
that she had been waiting for.  Yes, Brooke had been a friend to her, the
best friend that she had ever had, but that was in the past and it was time
to look forward.  She had to look forward.  However, even as these thoughts
ran through her head the blonde turned back around to observe Brooke's
figure, small and cowering.  She felt her eyes begin to well with the sting
of unshed tears and she averted her eyes once more.</p>

<p>Struggling with herself for a moment, Nicole finally turned back to face
Brooke.  She stood there watching her for a moment more, then crossed the
short distance between them and wrapped her arms Brooke who almost
immediately turned into her shoulder and began to cry in earnest.  Nicole
held the shuddering body in her arms and sighed deeply to herself.  There
was a reason Brooke McQueen was the most popular girl in school, and it
wasn't because she accessorized well, and was tall and blonde-although those
things didn't hurt.  It was because there was a fine line between being
admired and incurring peoples hate, it was a line that Brooke walked
masterfully without even knowing it.  To put it succinctly, the girl was a
sympathetic character despite her obvious privilege.  It wasn't a matter of
having to love her, or even like her, as much as the fact that you couldn't
quite hate her, and that was enough.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Nicole heard Brooke whisper as she finally pulled herself
together and began to separate herself from her friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, I've always had a soft spot for blondes…that's why I became
one," Nicole responded standing up and offering her hand to Brooke.  "We
have to get you cleaned up, to borrow a phrase from Mary Cherry, you look
like you look like ten miles of bad road."</p>

<p>Brooke grasped her hand, but regarded the other girl somewhat dubiously.</p>

<p>"I let you cry on Pashmina, don't even think about looking at me like that,"
Nicole responded grumpily.</p>

<p>"It's good to have you back," Brooke replied smiling slightly.  Nicole
rolled her eyes in response but a small smile appeared on her face too.  A
little-and she stressed the little part-of her was glad to be back too.</p>

<p>Jane shifted the laundry basket she was carrying, shifting the weight of it
so that it rested on her hip freeing up one of her hands.  Opening the door
she quickly pushed her way inside and flipped the light on.  Looking around
the room she shook her head, the place was an absolute mess.  Of all of her
daughters wonderful qualities keeping an orderly room was not one of them.</p>

<p>Shifting the basket once again she made her way over to Sam's bed
unceremoniously dropping the laundry basket onto the mattress.  She then
spun around and surveyed the room once again.  As long as she was there it
couldn't hurt to tidy the place up a bit, she thought to herself, her eyes
focusing on the natural disaster that for at least two days out of the month
served as Sam's desk.</p>

<p>Making her way over to the offending object she sighed deeply wondering
where to begin.  Taking another step forward, she failed to notice a book
lying on the floor in front of her and tripped over it, knocking into the
desk which sent a myriad of papers and books plummeting to the ground.
Regaining her balance she looked at the damage she had done, an ironic smile
crossing her face.  At least now she knew where to begin.</p>

<p>Bending down she began to pick up the scattered objects placing them into
drawers or onto the bookshelf in an orderly fashion, then she turned her
attention to the rest of the desk doing the same with the objects resting on
it.  Finishing up with that she took a step back to survey her handy work,
and pleased with the results was about to turn around when she noticed one
book partially hidden under the desk.</p>

<p>Reaching out for it she noticed something sticking out of it's side, but
paid no attention to whatever it was until it fell out of the book as she
picked it up.  It had fallen so that the back of it was facing up, so all
that she could tell immediately was that it was a pamphlet of some kind.
Shrugging her shoulders she reached down and picked it up, opening the cover
of the book to replace it when she caught sight of the front of it.  What
she say almost made her drop it again.</p>

<p>"Same sex equals safe sex, a guide to safe sexual relations for the other
ten per cent," Jane read out loud.  She could read the words, individually
she understood them, but she just couldn't seem to wrap her mind around what
she was seeing.</p>

<p>Placing the book down on top of the desk with a shaky hand, Jane opened up
the pamphlet.  It was certainly a guide, she thought to herself as she
flipped through the pages.  A sensitive, yet informative guide for teenagers
engaged in homosexual relationships.  She closed the pamphlet and placed it
in the book lying it back on the ground where she had spotted it lying only
moments before, then she took a step back from the desk.</p>

<p>The primary question that kept running through her mind was 'why did Sam
have a pamphlet that was basically a manual for gay relationships?'.  It was
a question that she could only come up with a few answers to, two of which
she found particularly startling.  The first option, the one she favored
although honesty didn't believe, was that it was research for an article Sam
was writing.  Sam was a budding journalist, it was possible, but the way in
which she found it went against her daughters modus operendi regarding her
work.  Despite the state that her room was often in, Jane had noticed that
Sam kept meticulous notes on whatever she was writing about at a given time,
titled file folders which held various articles and notes on the subject for
one.  This wasn't like that at all.  Not once had Jane seen Sam just shove
something she was working on into a book and leave it on the floor.</p>

<p>This then brought her to her next option, which surprised but didn't quite
alarm her.  That was that Sam was curious about same sex relationships.
Teenagers were often curious, that was their job after all,  to learn.  She
was curious and she had sought out information, that was a very responsible,
very Sam thing to do, Jane thought to herself.  This option was very
plausible, and to Jane much, much, much more acceptable than option number
three, which was that Sam was already engaged in a gay relationship and
wanted to know how to go about hitting a homerun.  This thought distressed
Jane greatly.  Her baby was too young to be engaging in acts not even the
Kama Sutra explored.  Plus, she didn't even want to consider who the girl
was that had deflowered her daughter.  No, she wasn't going to consider that
at the moment, she couldn't consider that a moment.  What she had to do was
sit down.  Yes, she was going to go sit down and then once she calmed down
she was going to consider things rationally.</p>

<p>What she did however was make her way down stairs and fix herself a rum and
coke.</p>

<p>Brooke practically skipped into the house, her body fused with vim and
vigor.  She was a happy girl, she could as well have been in a musical
comedy for all of the saccharine that streaming out of her every pore. In
other words she was having a good afternoon.  Hearing a movement in the
living room, Brooke placed her prize behind her back and carefully moved
forward to see who it was.</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke greeted spotting Jane.  If she had been in anything other the
completely euphoric mood she was in, she would have noticed that the older
woman looked a little pale, and slightly dazed, but she was in the
completely euphoric mood she was in and she didn't notice that the older
woman was a little pale and dazed.  "Is Sam home?" she asked trying not to
sound totally like a kid at a candy factory.</p>

<p>"She's upstairs," Jane responded shaking herself out of the stupor she had
been in ever since she had left her daughters bedroom.  "You're in a good
mood," she commented noticing Brooke's sudden animation.  It surprised her,
because for the last couple of days both she and Sam had been moping around
like they were straight out of an after school special.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke agreed leaving it at that.  Somehow she didn't think that
declaring that she had come to terms with the social implications of  the
love she felt for Jane's daughter, would go over well so she decided that a
simple 'yeah' would do the trick.  "Later," she continued a moment later as
she began to maneuver herself so that Jane couldn't see what was behind her
back.  She then quickly made her way to and up the stairs, just barely
hearing Jane's comment that she was heading out to the grocery store as she
continued her ascent.</p>

<p>Sam's door was slightly ajar when Brooke reached it; this she took as a sign
from God to continue so she did so without reservation.  Once in the room,
she spotted Sam typing diligently away at her computer.  Two months ago this
sight would have terrified Brooke to the very marrow of her bones, since the
brunette had had an uncanny way of focusing a great majority of her work on
Brooke-the reason why Brooke now knew and it turned her frown upside
down-but now the blonde just found the display terrible cute.  Closing the
door behind her silently, Brooke snuck up behind Sam, bent down and wrapped
one of her arms around the girl so that all that stood between them was the
back of the chair.</p>

<p>"I saw you," Sam stated.  But Brooke had felt her jump momentarily at the
first touch of her arm and knew better.</p>

<p>"Of course you did,"  the blonde responded with an indulgent smile that she
was probably lucky Sam couldn't see.  "Pour vous," Brooke continued a second
later unfurling the arm which had remained behind her back, presenting Sam
with a single red rose.</p>

<p>At that sight of the rose Sam turned around to look into Brooke's smiling
face.  "Thank you," she breathed.</p>

<p>"You're welcome," Brooke said raising herself a little so that she could
bring her lips to Sam's.</p>

<p>"You're in a good mood," Sam commented once they separated.  She could feel
the energy coming off of Brooke in waves.  It was actually quite
intoxicating and, not for the first time by any means, Sam wished that they
had the house to themselves once again.  She really, really wished that they
had the house to themselves.  Really.  Really.</p>

<p>"So I keep hearing," Brooke responded standing up and moving to lean against
the corner of Sam's desk.  "I talked to Nicole today."</p>

<p>"I take it things went well," Sam replied, surprised but pleased.  Maybe
Brooke hadn't been projecting when she said that Nicole actually had a heart
buried somewhere in the deep Siberian mine shaft she called a heart.</p>

<p>"Eventually," Brooke said half sighing dramatically.  "I only had to have a
nervous breakdown, before things started to go really well."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I think I'd been really tense for the past couple of days, I have a
tendency to bottle up emotions, and today I basically caved in like Rosie
O'Donnell at a Hostess sale.  Nicole…picked up the pieces," Brooke related
in a steady tone, though her face revealed some of the emotions that she
must have gone through during their confrontation.</p>

<p>"So she not going to tell?" Sam asked just to clear things up.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Brooke responded.  She was quiet for a moment after
that, then she smiled.  "But that's not the issue.  The truth is somewhere
after the begging, and towards the end of the breakdown I realized that I
don't care if she tells…and *that* feels pretty excellent," she continued,
before pausing once more.  "Unless you care, because I can threaten her if
you want."</p>

<p>Sam smiled at the last part because she was sure that Brooke would do it.
She was finally beginning to realize that as much as she was powerless when
it came to Brooke, Brooke was powerless when it came to her.  She found it
oddly comforting.  "That's sweet, but not necessary.  I'm sleeping with the
head cheerleader, I've already gotten my props."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled then swooped in kissing Sam's cheek before moving so that she
kneeling beside Sam's chair.</p>

<p>"What are you doing later?" the cheerleader asked.  "Nothing?  Good," she
continued before Sam had a chance to respond.  "I was hoping you'd say
that."</p>

<p>"Let me guess?  You have an idea," Sam replied looking down at Brooke
curiously.  "It better not involve the removal of clothes and a tub of
jello."</p>

<p>"That was just a suggestion," Brooke responded although she leered at Sam
suggestively anyway.  "Actually," she continued ignoring the look Sam shot
her, "I have reservations."</p>

<p>"Reservations about what?"  Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Reservations at a restaurant," Brooke clarified.</p>

<p>"A restaurant?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"A restaurant," Brooke confirmed.</p>

<p>Sam looked at her blankly, and Brooke smiled again standing up and pulling
out Sam's chair.  Once Sam's legs were free of the desk she then sat down on
the brunette's lap and draped her arm around the back of the chair.  Sam
looked at her with a bemused expression but didn't still didn't say
anything.</p>

<p>"This is me," Brooke started, "asking you to accompany me to dinner tonight.
  Dinner at a restaurant, one with menus and waiters, and cheesy elevator
music and those cute little dessert trolleys."</p>

<p>"A date?" Sam asked looking up at Brooke.</p>

<p>"Yeah, an honest to God date," Brooke responded.  "I think it's about time,
don't you?" she asked smiling.</p>

<p>"And here I thought all this time I had been dating the cheapest woman in
the world," Sam replied with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, mamma hit the jackpot and who better to spend it on than her
bitch," Brooke responded leaning in and rubbing her nose against Sam's,
effectively diffusing any scathing response the brunette could have come up
with.</p>

<p>"Were you born this charming, or is this the result of tireless hours of
practice?" Sam asked sarcastically though a beautiful smile was gracing her
equally beautiful lips.</p>

<p>"I'm all natural baby," Brooke responded bringing their lips together
playfully.</p>

<p>"Tell that to Clairol," Sam replied a wicked grin spreading across her face.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Brooke stated drawing her head
back slightly so that she could see Sam's face.</p>

<p>"I've seen the bottles," Sam responded, the smile never having left her
face.</p>

<p>"That's…it's just to lighten it," Brooke stammered.</p>

<p>"I love you anyway," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"That's very big of you," Brooke commented.</p>

<p>"I know.  That's why I'm fabulous," Sam agreed.</p>

<p>"Shut up and gimme some sugar," Brooke responded smiling as she leaned in.
Sam smiled back and brought her head forward bringing their lips together in
a deep, passionate kiss.  "Come on," Brooke said softly when they separated,
taking Sam's hand into her own.</p>

<p>"Where?" Sam asked, allowing Brooke to lead her nevertheless.</p>

<p>"To the door," Brooke responded walking them over to said object which she
locked upon their arrival.  "Then to bed," she continued once again leading
Sam by the hand to the object in question.</p>

<p>"My mom," Sam started.</p>

<p>"Your mom's gone grocery shopping," Brooke responded with a wide smile as
she lifted the laundry basket resting on the bed to the floor.  "We have the
house all to ourselves."</p>

<p>"I wish I had a million dollars," Sam whispered as a smile covered her face.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked quizzically drawing Sam towards her all the same.</p>

<p>"When you first came in, I wished that we had the house all to ourselves
again," Sam responded placing her hands on Brooke's hips.  "Since that wish
came true, I just thought that I'd cover my bases," she continued as her
hands found there way under Brooke's shirt.</p>

<p>"That's my girl," Brooke responded before leaning forward and pressing her
lips Sam's.  As she did this Sam slipped her hands underneath Brooke's
shirt, massaging the soft skin there as she leaned into Brooke and felt her
body begin to hum.  After minutes, or hours, or a life time-Sam wasn't sure
which and really didn't care-Brooke pulled away from her minutely, only mere
centimeters separating them and looked at Sam with wide open eyes.  Her
cheeks slightly flushed, and her lips slightly parted she stood there,
offering herself to Sam.</p>

<p>Sam immediately began to push the material of Brooke's shirt up but with an
almost painful slowness, her eyes taking in every inch of skin as it was
revealed, worshipping not just the body but the girl in front of her.
Pulling the shirt over Brooke's head Sam let it fall to the floor absently
as she leaned in and attached her lips to Brooke's neck, licking and kissing
her skin sensuously but hungrily.  Leaving a wet trail in her wake Sam made
her way over to Brooke's shoulder, nipping at the skin as her hands made
there way behind Brooke's back and unhooked her bra.</p>

<p>Stepping back Sam then raised her hands to Brooke's shoulder and freed the
blonde from the confines of her bra before renewing the contact between
them, just into time to hear Brooke gasp slightly and feel the tremble that
ran through her body.  Ducking her head down Sam placed her lips over
Brooke's heart kissing her, then trailed her way in between the valley of
the cheerleaders breasts and down her stomach to the waist band of her
pants.  With her head now level with Brooke's waist Sam ran her hands up
Brooke's legs bringing them to the waist band of her pants and unhooked
them, slowly drawing the zipper down, then peeling the parasuco's off of the
blonde's body.</p>

<p>Standing up and taking a step back once Brooke was free of the garment, Sam
gazed at Brooke, who was standing perfectly still allowing the inspection
without the slightest sign of protest.</p>

<p>"How can you do that?" Brooke asked softly as Sam watched her, a note of
wonder creeping into her voice.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked drawing her eyes to Brooke's.</p>

<p>"Look at me like you've never seen me before," Brooke responded.</p>

<p>"Because every time I see you it *is* like the first time," Sam replied as
reverently as Brooke had posed the question, a gentle smile crossing her
lips as she raised her hands to her own body and began to disrobe.  Brooke
reached out for her, but Sam stepped back shaking her head, that gentle
smile she had gradually turning impish.  Brooke returned to her former
position, settling herself to the idea that this was now Sam's show.
Actually, as the brunette began to left her shirt up teasingly and caressed
her own abdomen sexily, Brooke had to admit that she really couldn't find
anything wrong with that.  Teasing Brooke with her excruciatingly slow
movements Sam revealed herself inch by inch, never letting Brooke touch her
until she was completely undressed.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Brooke breathed out desperately when Sam finally freed her from
her prison and allowed their skin to meet for the first time.  Pressing
herself firmly against the brunette Brooke brought their lips together, her
hands roaming over Sam's body franticly, as Sam moaned and arched into her.</p>

<p>Somehow, neither one of them actually certain how it actually happened, they
ended up on the bed, Brooke smiling and leaning over Sam.  The brunette
responded to their new position by pulling Brooke's mouth down to hers,
forcing the blonde to drape her body over Sam's completely, so that almost
every part of them was in contact.</p>

<p>Breaking the contact between their lips almost regretfully Brooke dropped
her head down and began to shower kisses along Sam's neck, trailing her lips
across her collar bone and then downwards, encircling Sam's right breast
with sweet kisses.  Sam arched up into Brooke's mouth, crying out into the
still of the room, her sounds of passion exciting Brooke even further as the
blonde captured Sam's nipple in her eager mouth.  As Brooke's lips
concentrated on Sam's chest, her hands once again began to explore the
brunette's body, another moan escaping the confines of Sam's lips as
Brooke's fingers danced along her torso causing waves of pleasure to roll
over Sam, her head turning to the side as she bit down on her lips hotly.</p>

<p>Slowly, adoringly Brooke kissed her way down Sam's body, as her hands rose
to take over where her lips had left off.  Sam's breath caught in her
throat, and her eyes closed, a decidedly erotic sound making it's way from
deep within her which brought an answering whimper from Brooke.</p>

<p>Now dragging her hand down, Brooke let her hand intimately explore the
smooth, soft flesh before removing her lips from Sam's abdomen and looking
up at Sam's face; her eyes were closed and her bottom lip snared between her
teeth erotically.  Brooke watched her with something close to awe.  Her hand
stopped it's movements, and she stayed in the position she was in watching
Sam, silently wishing that she would open her eyes.  And when those brown
orbs did flutter open Brooke was captured by their vibrancy, her breath
hitching with look of raw passion clouding them, directed at her.  Not
taking her eyes off of Sam's Brooke shifted her position slightly, moving
further down on the bed, then lowered her lips the flesh of Sam's inner
thighs, licking and kissing the skin she found there passionately.</p>

<p>Sensations were running rampant throughout Sam's body, wonderful,
exhilarating feelings that seemed to engulf her completely as Brooke kissed
her way up Sam's legs. When the blonde finally reached her intended
destination, her tongue slipped out and dipped between the folds of Sam's
sex with an indolence that was almost unbearable yet maddeningly exciting at
the same time. Sam's eyes once again closed at the touch of Brooke's mouth
to the center of her being, despite the fact that she was desperately
willing them to stay open, and her hands grasped at her sheets, her fingers
retracting into fists as she grabbed handfuls of sheet and her body
undulated.</p>

<p>Prying her eyes open with an almost superhuman force, Sam's eyes held the
blue of Brooke's for a moment before she felt the blonde's mouth close
around the bud of her pleasure and her fingers slipped inside of her, moving
in and out of her attentively as Brooke lips and tongue caressed the nucleus
of her pleasure.  Sam's body rose and fell vigorously, as her right hand
clutched at the sheets beside her and her left hand held Brooke firmly in
place, as if there was any place else the blonde would rather have been.
Brooke reveled in Sam's death grip as she felt the body beneath hers tense,
Sam's body rising one last time before the physical and emotional pleasure
she was feeling finally cumulated into one mind-blowing orgasm that washed
over her like a tidal wave, her body shaking and shivering as she moaned
Brooke's name over and over again.</p>

<p>Sam reached out blindly drawing Brooke upwards needing to feel every inch of
the cheerleader against her.  Raising herself up, Brooke planted small
kisses along Sam's body as the brunette's body came under control.  Raising
her face above Sam's, Brooke simply gazed at her until she felt Sam's hand
come to rest on her cheek and caught those magnificent eyes watching her.
Having already learned that words often failed her at moments like this
Brooke simply leaned down and brought her lips to Sam's once more, trying to
pour everything that she felt for her into it, trying to make her kiss the
embodiment of her love.</p>

<p>Breaking from the kiss Sam stroked the side of Brooke's face gently, her
fingers following a pattern only she could detect on the warm skin of the
blonde's face.  "What are you thinking?" Sam asked, truly having no idea
what the cheerleader was thinking.  She had discovered that after they made
love Brooke's mind usually wandered to strange yet wondrous places.</p>

<p>Brooke turned her head to side and could just see over the edge of the bed
to the laundry basket lying on the floor.  "I think that we should do this
load," Brooke responded decisively.  Sam rolled her eyes and tilted her head
up to the ceiling, her body trembling with barely restrained laughter.</p>

<p>Brooke carefully exited her room, checking to see if the hallway was clear
before making her way out into the hall and over to Sam's room. Checking the
knob she found the door open and slipped inside noiselessly.   Sam was
standing in front of her mirror, her back turned to Brooke, and the blonde
leaned against the door she had just closed with a smile and observed the
other girl with a soft smile on her face.  Sam was dressed semi-casually-as
Brooke had suggested so they won't draw too much attention when leaving the
house-and standing there watching her brush her hair Brooke was certain that
if she wasn't already entirely in love with Sam she would have fallen for
her watching her there in the pale light and peace of the moment.</p>

<p>"In civilized society it's considered customary to knock before entering
someone's private space," Sam drawled lazily, not for a moment stopping her
actions.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled wider and made her way over to her girlfriend.  "If someone
had been ready on time, this barbarous act would need not have been
commented," she responded stopping slightly behind Sam, meeting the
brunette's gaze in the mirror.  "You're gorgeous," Brooke continued a second
later.</p>

<p>Sam smiled a wicked, sexy smile and turned around so that she could see
Brooke completely.  "I suppose," she replied in an almost whisper, "that it
takes one to know one," she went on raking her eyes over Brooke, who-she
noticed in a naughty kind of way-was turning a bit red.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me like that," Brooke warned feeling herself begin to react
to the positively lecherous look on Sam's face.  "We're already late."</p>

<p>Sam put up her hands in the universal sign of peace, although she still
looked rather amused and a little bit lecherous.  "I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Is everything set?" Brooke asked before gallantly taking Sam's hand into
hers and kissing it softly.</p>

<p>"The elder," Sam said started smiling over a Brooke, "thinks that I'm off to
the movies with Carm and Lily, and that it's very sweet of you to drop me
off," she continued deciding to omit the part about her mothers almost
dictatorial questions about her plans for the evening.</p>

<p>"Chanel boutique for me," Brooke responded.  "After you my dear," she
continued crossing over to the door and spryly opening it.</p>

<p>Cynthia Gale rolled her eyes then turned to smile at her mother warmly as
she made puking sound effects in her head.  Ah, family dinners, what heinous
torture they were.  She couldn't believe that she was missing lady's night
at "The Mirror" AND the Chanel boutique so that she could share spaghetti
and garlic bread with her parents and her bratty younger brother-or as she
liked to refer to him "the accident". Considering, not for the first time,
setting off her own beeper she lazily rolled her head to the side.  'Well,
that's interesting," she thought to herself as she gazed at a table off to
the corner of the restaurant.  'What the hell is that,' she continued to
think as she straightened up and focused more intently on the table.</p>

<p>She thought that she saw Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen sitting there.
Unless, they had somehow been miraculously cloned, she was sure that she saw
Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen.  They were sitting, together, at a table
for two.  Cynthia was confused.</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke hated each other.  Everyone knew that.  There were certain
universal truths in the world, Cynthia thought to herself: Not counting
Pamela Lee, Celine Dion was Canada's biggest shame, kid's who played
Dungeons and Dragons would end up thirty-year old virgins, you didn't where
a swim-suit in L.A. unless you had a suitable tan to go along with it, and
Sam and Brooke were bitter enemies.  She had been in the cafeteria that
fateful day of the most destructive food-fight in Kennedy High's history.
She had seen it's propagators, the darkly beautiful Sam and the sunshine
perfect Brooke glare at each other with the white hot intensity of a sun
before they began flinging food at each other that afternoon, she had read
the scathing newspaper articles, and seen the grown-up version of red rover
played in the hallways.  She had witnessed first hand the unpleasantness
that was Brooke and Sam's relationship, and the fact that she now saw them
sitting down to what looked like a civil dinner with each other just didn't
compute.</p>

<p>She turned to face her mother with a glassy expression.  "What?"</p>

<p>"I said, isn't that Jane McPherson's daughter?" her mother repeated looking
over at the table Cynthia herself had just been studying.</p>

<p>"Well, the brunette is Sam McPherson so I think it's a definite
possibility," Cynthia responded dryly causing her mother to frown.</p>

<p>"Why are you like that?" her mother asked in response.</p>

<p>"Like what?"  Cynthia responded tiredly.</p>

<p>"Don't use that tone with me," her mother replied.</p>

<p>"What tone?"</p>

<p>"You know what tone."</p>

<p>"If I knew what I tone, I wouldn't have asked what tone?"</p>

<p>"Don't get fresh with me young lady!"</p>

<p>"Oh Lord," Cynthia groaned, immediately regretting it.  It was going to be a
long night.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke observed Sam thoughtfully, studying her face in the pale orange glow
of the candlelight, watching the way the shadowed shifted and swayed across
her features, making the face the Brooke had studied so intently and so
lovingly mysterious and familiar to her all at once.  She thought that she
would never get tired of looking at that face, that it would always be a
wonder to her.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked snapping herself out of the daze she'd been in.</p>

<p>"I asked if you noticed anything strange about the way my mom was acting
today?" Sam repeated with a smile.  The truth was Brooke wasn't the only one
with a wandering mind.  Sam had been in a somewhat dreamlike state since
they had left the house, she couldn't quite seem to wrap her mind around the
idea that they were actually out on a date, a real date.  She felt like she
should have been anxious, or jumpy or something, but it all just seemed so
natural.  It was like they had done it a million times before.  But, Sam
thought to herself, even though her entire relationship with Brooke had been
a series of new experiences, it had never really felt that alien, it was
more like they were just getting comfortable.</p>

<p>"N…" Brooke started to respond but she stopped and crinkled her brows
together in thought.  "Maybe," she responded, thinking about how she had
found Jane that afternoon for the first time.  "She seemed a little out of
it when I came home, but I wouldn't say strange exactly. Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, either I'm more of a hermit than I thought or something's
going on with her, because when I told her I was going out tonight her eyes
practically bugged out of her head and she stumbled all over her words until
I mentioned Carm and Lily," Sam responded with a rather perplexed look on
her face.  "It was like I had told her I was going on a crack run, or
enrolling in Mme. Butterfly's school for education of young wenches."</p>

<p>"Well," Brooke responded slowly.  "You are an attractive young woman, maybe
she really is worried about your virtue.  It's a big, bad, good-looking city
out there."</p>

<p>"Very funny."</p>

<p>"I'm serious.  Kind of," Brooke responded smiling.  "She's just being a
mom."</p>

<p>"I know, I just don't like it that's all," Sam responded with a  pout still
remembering with horror the lecture they had gotten after Jane had found
condoms in their washroom.  "Remember the condom speech?  Ugh," she
continued dramatically making a horrified face.  "I canNOT go throw that
again."</p>

<p>"There is a bright side," Brooke related in an up beat tone.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I won't have to sit through the speech this time," Brooke respond laughing
heartily, until   she caught the look in Sam's eyes, then she stopped,
immediately.  "Seriously though," she added sniffing and straightening up,
"I don't think we have anything to worry about.  I'm probably the last
person she'd look at, so really it's all good."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," Sam responded.  "It'll just make things more difficult
if she starts playing Jane McPherson: Middle Aged Detective. She watched
'Murder She Wrote', to much for me to be completely comfortable."</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, then said "Sam," in a very grave tone, her
eyes never leaving the brunette's for a moment.  "Let's not talk about your
mother.  I mean no offense to her…but, truthfully … she's a buzz kill."  And
it was true.  Sam regarded Brooke for a moment then smiled, acknowledging
that she really didn't want to talk about her mother either.</p>

<p>"Tell me something about you that I don't know?"  Brooke asked a moment
later, looking at Sam softly but intensely.  Sometimes she would look at Sam
and think that for all the things she knew about the girl, for instance that
her ear lobes were particularly sensitive or that she really did like Shania
Twain, she really knew nothing at all.</p>

<p>"It'll take some of the mystery out of the relationship," Sam warned
somewhat uncomfortably.  It wasn't easy for her to let her defenses down,
she had spent so many of her prime years building them  up after all.
"Mystery is sexy isn't it?" she asked, but she already knew she would
answer.  Brooke did that to her, and truthfully she was glad she did.</p>

<p>"I don't want mystery, I want you," Brooke responded honestly.  She wasn't
going to force Sam to tell her anything, she was sure she would find out
everything she needed to know about Sam in time, it was just that she didn't
want to wait.  With everything that had happened between them over the past
few days, she just wanted something that would bring them closer together.</p>

<p>"When I was eight, I wanted to be a ballerina," Sam responded dipping her
head down slightly, looking at Brooke through her eyelashes.  She had never
told anyone but her mother this.  "I had the heart…but I didn't have the
feet," she continued with a touch of wistfulness to her voice.  "To this day
I can't listen to Abba without getting a little misty," she practically
groaned.</p>

<p>"Why Abba?" Brooke asked slightly perplexed.  She was with Sam up until she
mentioned the Swedes.  Besides, she decided that it was better to focus on
that part of the statement and not mention how absolutely adorable she
thought it was that Sam wanted to be a dancer.  The mental picture she was
getting of a little Sam in a too-too was almost too much for her.</p>

<p>"I know it's not spelt the same, but I was young, and not yet hooked on
phonics," Sam responded.  "The acronym for the American Ballet Association
is ABA," she continued, "or Abba, as I liked to think of it.  This, and the
fact that Abba sang Dancing Queen, just did it for me."</p>

<p>Brooke nodded somewhat solemnly, deciding to part with some information
herself.  After all, she too had had a childhood, and like most peoples it
was rather embarrassing, despite her fathers contention that it wasn't
embarrassing but precious.  "I always wanted to be She-Ra," Brooke revealed.
  "I even had a plastic sword … but Dad took it away when I kept poking
myself with it.  However, I still have the tiara."</p>

<p>Sam smiled and looked over at Brooke fondly, her eyes sparkling in the
candlelight.  She-Ra, oh lord.  "That explains so much," she whispered
meeting Brooke's gaze.  "You were a slow child weren't you?"</p>

<p>"A slow child with heart," Brooke informed her with a smile of her own.
"And just for the record, I like your feet."</p>

<p>Brooke looked across the hallway to where Sam was standing, then looked away
again.  She then shuffled her feet and pretended to be listening to what
Mary Cherry was saying before looking over at Sam once more then looking
away again.  She shuffled her feet some more, only stopping when Nicole
whacked her on the arm and shot her a deadly glare.</p>

<p>"Either go over there or stop staring at her, people are going to think you
paint clowns or something," the shorter blonde whispered harshly.  God how
she hated young love.  It reduced otherwise normal people into simpering,
annoying idiots.  It's like when the heart got filled up the brain fell out
or something.</p>

<p>"I just…I was…yeah okay," Brooke responded shifting her gaze between Nicole
and Sam once more before finally beginning to make her way across the hall
hesitantly, looking back at Nicole for moral support but only seeing a
disillusioned head shake.  It actually gave her the motivation that she
needed.</p>

<p>Having completed her trek across the hall, Brooke stopped beside Lily and
smiled at the occupants of the circle, which is to say Carmyn and Lily.
They smiled back at her.  Brooke smiled back at them and nodded her head.
They smiled back at her.  Brooke turned her head and smiled at Sam.</p>

<p>"Will you excuse us for a second," Sam said to the other two brunette's.
They nodded and Sam motioned from Brooke to follow her down the hallway a
little bit.</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke said still smiling once they were away from the other two.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam responded both amused and confused by Brooke's behavior.</p>

<p>"So uh, gym was pretty boring today huh?" Brooke asked.</p>

<p>"You mean the finer points of field hockey just didn't do it for you?" Sam
asked unconsciously rubbing at her shoulder where she had been hit with a
stick.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?  That looked like it hurt?" Brooke asked concentrating on
Sam's shoulder.  "I would have checked on you, but I feared for my life if I
left the penalty box."  Sam smirked.</p>

<p>"I feared for your life when you got sent to the penalty box," she responded
remembering the look of pure rage that had engulfed teachers face.  "What
did you say to her anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember," Brooke responded shaking her head and rubbing at the
back of her neck.  "I wish I knew though, so that I could never, ever say it
again."</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment after that, Brooke's eyes drifting around
again, only settling on Sam for brief moments before skittering away once
again.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Sam asked finally.  She hadn't seen Brooke this jittery in a
while.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I mean…did ummm," Brooke started, her eyes flittering around there
immediate vicinity before settling on Sam once again, "I just…I was
wondering if you, you know, like had fun last night?" she asked looking at
Sam once more before her eyes started to roam nervously once more.</p>

<p>"It was the best date I've ever been on," Sam responded her heart swelling
as she smiled at the blonde reassuringly.  Brooke was nervous about how
their date had gone.  Considering that they had already made love, broken
up, gotten back together and declared their love for each other, Sam found
it both ludicrous and unbelievably charming that Brooke would be nervous
about how dinner had gone.</p>

<p>"It's the only date you've been on," Brooke pointed out reasonably, still
looking at her shoes.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'd say I'm off to an excellent start," Sam responded dipping her
head down trying to get Brooke to look up again.  When she did look up Sam
smiled at her tenderly and for the first time since Brooke had come over to
her she seemed to relax.  Sam shook her head, god how she loved this girl.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I'm telling you Jennifer 'call me love' Hewitt had a boob job," Cynthia
stated with absolute certainty.  "Have you seen 'I Know What you Did Last
Summer'?  Don't even try to tell me those things real.  She could use them
as floatation devices if she was ever in a plane crash," she continued as
she and her entourage-as she liked to think of them-made their way to their
lockers.</p>

<p>"But she seems so natural," Susan protested.  She liked 'call me love'
Hewitt.  She thought that she had spunk, and real talent.</p>

<p>"Yeah, natural like SMG's hair colour," Cynthia responded derisively as she
opened up her locker and began to unload her books.  Looking up her eyes
caught on a scene and stopped what she was doing to observe it.  "Okay, look
at that," she said gesturing towards Brooke and Sam who were standing off to
the end of the hallway talking to themselves.  "Does somebody want to tell
me what the fuck is up with that?" she asked looking around at the group
around her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that is kind of weird," Megan agreed observing the scene.  "I thought
they like hated each other or something."</p>

<p>"Yeah, don't they like hate each other or something," Regan agreed.  "They
like hate each other."</p>

<p>"They can't hate each other too much," Cynthia replied looking at them with
narrowed eyes.  "I saw them having dinner together last night."</p>

<p>"Their parents probably want them to be like friends or something.  Think
about how they act at school and imagine what they must be like a home,"
Susan suggested.</p>

<p>"They were there alone," Cynthia responded, "And they seemed to be getting
along just fine."</p>

<p>"Sam hasn't written any damaging articles about the popular's in a long
time," Megan observed keenly.  "Maybe they don't hate each other anymore.
Maybe they're like friends now."</p>

<p>"Thank you for that insightful commentary," Cynthia muttered under her
breath.  She was certain that she had already covered that and with much
more flare and wit than Megan.  "I'd kill to find out what happened though.
Blood feuds just don't end over night."</p>

<p>"Romeo and Juliet ended their blood feud by falling in love," Regan
commented in a dreamy tone.  Cynthia rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I can just see Brooke climbing up to Sam's window declaring that she
is the sun and Sam the moon," she responded, which resulted in a good laugh
for all.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Harrison observed Brooke and Sam from his position just down the hall from
them.  He had joined Carmen and Lily shortly after Sam had pulled Brooke
away, and had immediately taken up spying on them.  When Brooke had began to
talk she had looked nervous, fidgeting with her hands and looking about her
anxiously, but she had calmed down soon after she began to speak to Sam and
they were now speaking with each other comfortably.  Every once in a while
he would see one them make a motion with her hand, or one of them turn to
the side trying to smother a laugh, and more than once in a while he would
see one of them look at the other in brief, intimate glances.</p>

<p>"Don't even think about going over there and starting something," Carmen
warned him, drawing Harrison out of his trance.  "They've been suffocated
for the past week and they don't need you going over there with outstretched
hands."</p>

<p>Harrison looked over at her with a slightly surprised look on his face.  Her
was surprised by the barely veiled hostility in her voice.  She wasn't
making a comment, she was issuing a warning.  He was not to go and upset
them or else.  He sighed, then focused on Carmen for the first time since
his muttered 'hello'.</p>

<p>"I know," he mumbled contritely.  Suddenly he was a four year old who had
been caught with freshly baked chocolate cake all over his face.  "I know I
was wrong," he continued shifting his position uncomfortably.  He had spent
the previous night looking through old photo albums, looking at old photos
of him trying to launch Sam off of the teeter totter, and Brooke using him
as life sized Barbie doll to try out her five year old hair styles etcetera,
etcetera.  And as he looked through the photo's he was reminded what a big
portion of his life they both held, but Sam especially.</p>

<p>As Brooke's words played through his head, he knew that she was right, and
that acting the way he was acting would only hurt him.  Because, Sam had
Brooke and Brooke had Sam, and if he went on playing his asshole games, it
was clear that he would have no one, especially since Carmen had just made
it very clear that she was onboard with Sam and Brooke, and where Carmen
went Lily went.  He supposed that it would take time for him to actually
become okay with the situation, that this feeling for them wouldn't just
disappear over night, but he realized that be better start acting a friend
instead of non-ex-boyfriend or else he wouldn't have a chance to make it up
to them.</p>

<p>"I'm going over there," he announced a moment later, looking between Carm
and Lily.  "But I swear I go in peace," he continued.  They looked at him
dubiously, but said nothing.  It was his right to wrong, and his wrong to
make even wronger if he should so choose.</p>

<p>Brooke was the first to spot his approach, which wasn't really surprising
considering that she was facing him, and she watched it inquisitively.  Sam
turned around shortly after Brooke spotted him, no doubt wondering what had
caught her girlfriends attention, and she then watched him too, her body
tensing perceptively and her lips thinning into a set line.</p>

<p>"Can I talk to you?" he asked once he reached them.  Sam shrugged.  "In
private?" he asked clarifying.  Sam hesitated.  "I'd rather not grovel in
the hallway," he said in response to her non-answer.  Brooke smiled
knowingly, and nudged Sam, who then glared at her but agreed to go off with
him nonetheless.</p>
