<p>It was Monday.  Brooke hated Monday's.  She firmly believed that Monday's
were a horrible way to spend one seventh of your life.  Then, to top it all
off, it was gym class.  Brooke was beginning to hate gym class.  Sighing
dramatically she yanked her top over her head and sat down reaching into her
gym bag.  As she yanked-and yank she did-her tank top out another shirt, a
red one, came out with it.  It was Sam's, Jane had caught Brooke just as she
was going out the door and shoved-alright gently handed-the shirt to her
asking her if she would be able to give it to Sam.  Brooke sighed again, the
shirt smelled like jasmine, just like Sam, and it was red, Sam loved red.</p>

<p>Pulling her own shirt over her head Brooke looked up and across the room.
Sam was standing on the other side of the locker room talking to Carmyn and
gesturing emphatically.  From the way Sam was gesturing at Carmyn's top half
Brooke guessed she was trying to bum a shirt off the girl seeing as she was
standing there half dressed.  Half dressed, Brooke thought to herself
longingly.  Half dressed was a good look on Sam she decided.  Letting out a
frustrated sigh the cheerleader picked up the red shirt that had been lying
next to her and balled it up.  Then, taking one last look at Sam she drew
her arm back and threw the balled up piece of cloth in Sam's direction
hitting her with it squarely on the head.</p>

<p>The locker room went quiet as the cottony red ball arched across the room;
everyone was following its path from point A to point B waiting for the
super bitch fight they were sure was going to occur after it reached its
destination.  The animosity between Brooke McQueen and Sam McPherson was
legendary-they were like Superman and Lex Luther, Xena and Callisto, Pinky
and the Brain-and now Brooke had just shot a projectile at her nemesis.
Chaos was sure to ensue and they were all eagerly awaiting it, after all
Brooke and Sam had practically turned hostility into an art form.  They were
poetry in motion really.</p>

<p>Sam slowly reached up and peeled the shirt from over her head,  then equally
as slowly she turned around and looked in the direction the t-shirt bomb had
came from.  What she found was Brooke staring directly at her eliminating
all other possible options.  The blonde was the guilty party and seemed to
want Sam to know it.  This confused Sam, however, as she looked at the
expression on Brooke's face the ball-of-bitch that had been building up in
her as the shirt whacked her up side the head drained away with
comprehension.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Sam asked calmly, she felt that she had to address the
situation verbally seeing as the entire locker room was watching them, and
she got a slight kick out of the fact that her unruffled reaction seemed to
leave everyone else in the room confused and slightly dazed.</p>

<p>"Your mom gave it to me...to give to you...which I did," Brooke mumbled then
looked away.  Her eyes had been locked on Sam's chest as she spoke and she
knew that she couldn't keep that up for much longer before somebody noticed.</p>

<p>"Did she tell you to hurl it at me?" Sam asked trying to contain a smile.
She knew what this was all about now, she had seen the way Brooke was
looking at her.</p>

<p>"No, I came up with that myself," Brooke muttered before bending down to tie
her shoes, effectively ignoring Sam for the rest of the allotted change
time.</p>

<p>Bouncing on her feet lightly Sam took the shirt that now rested in her hands
and pulled it over her head.  Once she got it on, she rolled her shoulder
around and bent her neck from side to side before clapping her hands
together energetically.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Carm asked looking at Sam oddly.  She had been acting like a
sugared up eight year old for the past couple of days, it was all very
bizarre.  That worried Carmyn because the last time Sam had acted this
bizarrely was when she had gotten together with Brooke and Carm wasn't sure
if she could handle another surprise of that magnitude.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded bounding some more.  "I'm just ready to go, you know,
burn some energy," she went on.  "It's all good."</p>

<p>Carm nodded in response, but somehow she got the impression that was NOT
indeed all good.</p>

<p>
'Spandex, it's a privilege not a right,' Sam thought to herself as she
bounced on her feet a little, "and she is certainly privileged," she
continued as she stared at Brooke.  She broke her gaze momentarily when the
teacher began to speak, but just as quickly her eyes returned to their
previous task which consisted completely of staring at Brooke's ass with an
almost scholarly interest.  She bounded some more.  Then rubbed her hands
together.  Then bounded some more.</p>

<p>"Ouch, Carm!" Sam whispered harshly in response to her friend knocking her
on the arm.</p>

<p>"McPherson, Ferrara...make mouths shut now!" the teacher called from in front
of them.  Sam and Carm both smiled politely and nodded.</p>

<p>"You were staring," Carm whispered softly trying to minimize all mouth
action.</p>

<p>"Was not," Sam responded, however even as the words left her mouth her eyes
were back on Brooke and she was definitely staring.</p>

<p>Carmyn knocked her again.</p>

<p>"Ferrara!  Nobody beats anyone up around here without my explicit
permission.  Understand?" the teacher asked darkly.</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am," Carmyn responded before shooting Sam a nasty look.  Sam was the
one suddenly stricken with a severe case of 'dirty-old-man' disease and she
was the one that got yelled at.  She just couldn't see how that worked out
on the karmic cycle.  On top of that the look had absolutely no effect on
Sam since she had immediately returned to her previous activities the moment
the teacher had spoken.  Carm sighed, it was going to be a long day.</p>

<p>"Sam?" Harrison asked snapping his fingers in front of the girls face.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah," Sam said returning to the real world.  She had been staring at
Brooke from across the lunchroom for the better part of fifteen minutes,
only stopping momentarily to pick up the container of salt she had knocked
over when Brooke flipped her hair which consequently turned Sam into a pile
of boneless mush that in turn flopped around and knocked the salt shaker
over.  "I heard you," she went on even though she had no idea what he was
talking about.</p>

<p>"So it's a deal then.  Next time you go on one of your anti-Brooke campaigns
I get a front row seat and backstage pass?" he asked confirming what he had
said earlier.</p>

<p>"Anti-Brooke?  Since when are you anti-Brooke?" Sam asked.  Now that Brooke
had been mentioned Harrison had her full attention.  Unfortunately for him
it seem there was no more anti-Brooke in Sam, if he was going to anti he
would have to anti himself.</p>

<p>"He's mad at her," Lily responded trying to smoother a smile as she mentally
re-called the display she had witnessed earlier.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He was talking to her today between first and second period and halfway
through the conversation she snapped at him," Carmyn started excitedly.</p>

<p>"Then he bitched back at her! Then after a minute of that..." Lily continued.</p>

<p>"Brooke ended up calling him J.C. and asked where Justin and Lance were,"
Carm finished trying unsuccessfully not to laugh out loud.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha, ha.  That's really funny," Harrison remarked dryly as he shot the
two of them deadly looks.  When he noticed the small smile on Sam's face he
observed her keenly for a moment before speaking.  "What did you do to her?"
he asked accusingly.</p>

<p>"Me?  Do?  To her?" Sam asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you've been acting like the energizer bunny for the past couple of
days while she's descended into the deep pits of Hades to emerge Princess
Bitch-a-lot, sister and right hand to Satan," he replied accusingly.</p>

<p>"Listen, I haven't done anything to her," Sam responded more soberly.
"Maybe YOU just need to brush up on your social skills a bit," she continued
somewhat antagonistically.  It was one thing for her to have previously made
Brooke's life a virtual hell on earth, but nobody else had better try it or
she'd be forced to non-violently kick one hundred percent of their ass.</p>

<p>Sam regarded her friends carefully, bouncing on her feet a little, but
mostly watching her friends carefully.  After lunch Lily and Carm had made a
big production of ditching Harrison and then tracking her and staring her
down like prison wardens.  The last time she had seen that particular look
on their faces she had spilled just about all of the beans she had, and she
wasn't particularly looking forward to spilling anymore.  She quite felt
like holding onto her beans this time around.</p>

<p>"What?" she asked finally.  They had to get this over with sooner or later
and she and her beans preferred that it be sooner.</p>

<p>"Is everything alright?" Lily asked softly as she watched Sam keenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam replied drawing the word out as long as humanly possible before
bouncing on her feet some more and blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>Carm and Lily exchanged a look that did not go unnoticed by the prisoner.</p>

<p>"How's Brooke?" Carm asked, her voice had that lilt to it that people
usually reserved for small children and animals.  Sam didn't appreciate it.</p>

<p>"She's fine too," Sam responded preparing to bounce some more.  However once
she got onto the tips of her toes Carm reached and grabbed her shoulders
pushing her back down to the ground.</p>

<p>"Stop that," Carm admonished.  "Please, please stop that," she went on, her
voice holding a pleading tone to it.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Sam asked struggling to bounce under Carmyn's grasp.</p>

<p>"That!" Carm said pointing to Sam's feet.  "That psychotic bouncing. Up and
down, up and down, side to side, up and down.  Please, please stop!"</p>

<p>"Okay," Sam responded softly looking at Carm like she had two heads.  "I'll
stop, you just take a deep a breath.  Look, no more bouncing," she went on
smiling reassuringly.  She couldn't believe that she was the one they were
doing an intervention on when Carm was so obviously very, very tense.</p>

<p>"The thing is," Lily started after Carm nodded at indicating that she should
continue the interrogation while she gathered her wits, "that for the past
week you've been acting increasing like a speed freak and Brooke seems to be
acting according to the gospel of St. Bastard or something...so, we were kind
of wondering if...you know...you two were having problems...or something."</p>

<p>"We're fine," Sam responded.  But even as she spoke as shadow of something
crossed her face.</p>

<p>"No, no we don't think that you are.  Something is definitely wrong," Carm
responded having come back to herself.  "You know we're going to badger you
until you tell us, take the easy road for once Sam, you might even like it."</p>

<p>"Brooke and I are fine.  There is no trouble in paradise," Sam responded.
They simply stared at her and she got the distinct impression that they
wanted more.  "It's just that...well, paradise has gotten a few new
inhabitants since we spoke last and one of them, of the Dad variety,
fractured his ankle and doesn't leave the house.  Ever," she went on her
tone darkening and her brows scrunching together in consternation.  "Ever,"
she added again just for good measure.  "He's just there, all the time, like
a lawn gnome or dust mites or something."</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence then the exclamation of "Ohmygod!" by
Carm, which was followed my many mini 'ohmygods' until she forced herself to
calm down when passerby's started to look at her.  "You're not getting any,"
she whispered pointing at Sam knowingly.  "That's why you've been...and she's
been...ohmygod," she continued in a hushed tone.</p>

<p>"It's not funny," Sam whispered menacingly as she shot Carm a look that
would have made Medusa run away with her tail between her legs.  And it
wasn't funny, it was a terrible situation, absolutely abominable.  The
situation made her very, very sad, and very, very hyper, and it made Brooke
very, very cranky.</p>

<p>"I beg to differ," was Carmyn's response as she doubled over.  To Carm, this
was priceless, absolutely priceless.  Sam was always authoritative, so
imposing, that to see her dissolve into a restless pile of nerves was
absolutely priceless.</p>

<p>"Sam's right," Lily stated after Carm spoke.  "Sexual frustration can be
incapacitating, and routinely forces people to do things they wouldn't do
under normal circumstances.  In fact that's how the women of Sparta ended
the Peloponnesian war."</p>

<p>"What?  They wouldn't sleep with each other because they were afraid their
parents would catch them?" Carm asked dissolving into another giggle spree,
and just when she had started to get herself under control, damn!</p>

<p>"This is just great," Sam responded moodily as she bounced on her feet
unconsciously, sending Carm off into another set of laughter.  "Just know
that I hate you intensely at the moment," Sam continued before starting down
the hall.</p>

<p>Carm and Lily went after her.</p>

<p>"Come on Sam," Carm whispered once they had caught up.  "I'm not getting any
either," she continued starting to laugh again.  "Besides you'll always have
gym class, and spandex and cold, cold showers."</p>

<p>"You're evil," was all Sam said in response, before bouncing on her feet
again, an absolutely despondent look coming over her face.</p>

<p>"We've gotta get this girl outside for a while," Carm said turning to Lily.
She actually felt bad once she saw the look on Sam's face.  She looked like
one of the puppy dogs on those humane shelter commercials.  It was pathetic
in a rather compelling way.  She wanted to help.</p>

<p>"The cheerleaders are practicing," Lily responded absently.</p>

<p>"Let's go," Sam responded instantaneously making a U-turn and heading for
the stadium.  Once again Carmyn and Lily exchanged amused looks and
quickened their steps to catch up with their rapidly retreating friend.</p>

<p>Brooke ran a hand through her wet hair, a slight shiver running through her
body.  That shower had certainly been cold.  Wrapping the towel more
securely around herself she walked over to her vanity mirror and leaned
over, placing her hands on the top of it and stared at her own reflection
studiously.  'Brooke,' she thought to herself, 'you have got to pull
yourself together.'  These were some very true thoughts, thoughts that she
carefully took into consideration, strenuously believed, and just couldn't
seem to follow through on for the life of her.</p>

<p>
Sam crept down the hall stealthily towards Brooke's bedroom, carefully
opening the door and sneaking in.  Turning around with a pleased smile on
her face she observed Brooke observing herself in the mirror before walking
over to her.  Wrapping her arms around Brooke's waist, Sam then rested her
chin on the blonde's shoulder and stared forward into the mirror.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell your fortune?" the brunette asked smiling.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Brooke replied dipping her head down so that she was looking
at the table surface.  "I was talking to myself."</p>

<p>"You might want to keep that on the down low...or at least blame it on your
hand so that people don't think you're crazy," Sam responded lightly, before
adding in a more serious tone, "What were you consulting yourself about?"</p>

<p>"I've got this problem you see," Brooke started looking up into the mirror
once more, her eyes locking with Sam's in the reflection surface.  "I've got
this really sexy girlfriend, I mean hot…hotter than Angelina Jolie in the
Arizona desert in August at high noon," Brooke continued.  "But that's not
my problem…actually I'm quite pleased with that."  Sam smiled.  "My problem
is that I have this condition…"</p>

<p>"Condition?" Sam asked knowingly, her eyes hooding slightly as she listened
to the now low timbres of Brooke's voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  My hands, they seem to have a mind of their own…they do things that
I don't remember telling them to do," Brooke responded as one of her hands
reached back and started to make it's way up Sam's thigh.</p>

<p>"What kind of things," Sam asked softly, she was momentarily distracted by
Brooke's problematic hands and the very pleasant effects they were having on
her.</p>

<p>"All kinds of things," Brooke responded with a dramatic sigh.  "I don't know
what to do.  I just can't help myself."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Sam began, "the best way to beat temptation is to yield to it,"
she continued before brushing Brooke's hair aside and licking her neck
sensuously.  Brooke groaned and turned around in the circle of Sam's arms
leaning forward but not quite bringing their lips together.</p>

<p>"We can't do this," Brooke whispered, her mouth hovering dangerously close
to Sam's.  However, she didn't sound terribly convinced, even to her own
ears.  In truth, she sounded acutely desperate to do it.</p>

<p>"Carpa Deum, Brooke," Sam whispered back.  "Seize me," she continued before
closing the distance between them and bringing their lips together in a
heated embrace.  Brooke, unable to help her response, drew her arms around
Sam bringing them closer together as the kiss deepened.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke practically moaned as she pulled away.  "They're just
downstairs."</p>

<p>"Their busy," Sam responded distractedly as she leaned in to take Brooke's
lips once more.  "Some conference call from Tokyo."  Certainly the situation
wasn't idle, but Sam had given up quixotic ideas such as flowers, and
candles, and Marvin Gaye days ago.  Desperate times, called for desperate
measures, and Tokyo would do.</p>

<p>"What about your mom?" Brooke asked allowing Sam to draw her into her.</p>

<p>"She's sitting in on it," Sam responded pleased to see Brooke start to
relax.  "I heard them talking."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled, "You mean you eavesdropped."</p>

<p>"Essentially," Sam answered with a matching grin.  "But aren't you glad that
I did?"</p>

<p>"Extremely," Brooke responded before bringing their lips together once
again.</p>

<p>The first contact was like heaven, both of them having felt as if it had
been months, years, or even decades since they had last been free to touch
each other unreservedly.  Since their parents had come back, it had all been
quick kisses here and there, brief moments snatched for themselves in dark
corners;  a covert operation, a hot/cold war as it were.</p>

<p>On those days, after dinner at pre-arranged times, Sam would sneak into a
mostly deserted area of the house, to be joined by Brooke a few minutes
later where all they could do was fan the fire that was burning them up
inside instead of extinguishing it.  And, even though it actually made their
situation worse, made them long for each other company with a greater
intensity than before they had meet, they continued to do it.  Because the
idea of being either further removed from each other than they already were
was unthinkable to them.  To each other they were life giving, a galvanizing
impetus, simply a daily necessity for the continued existence of the unique
species categorized as Sam and Brooke.  So those stolen moments, those
clandestine meetings were cherished and dreaded at the same time, for when
it was time to part-and they always had to part-the world was a little bit
colder than before, and Sam a little more hyper and Brooke a little more
ornery.</p>

<p>"It feels like forever since I've gotten to hold you," Brooke whispered
softly when the briefly separated.  "To touch you," she continued almost
reverently.</p>

<p>"Forever is far too long," was Sam's response, to which Brooke smiled.  Sam
then turned her attention to Brooke's neck as one of her hands parted
Brooke's towel and leisurely made it's way underneath, tickling Brooke's
skin along the way.  As Sam's hand began to explore Brooke's hidden
treasures the only thing that was keeping the towel attached to Brooke's
body was the intimate proximity of their bodies; and as Sam's hand trailed
up Brooke's torso to cup her breast, Brooke just couldn't seem to find it
within herself to care.</p>

<p>
"Brooke?" a voice called from outside the door freezing the two girls in
their positions.  They were only spurred into motion when they saw the knob
begin to turn and heard the door start to creak open.</p>

<p>Sam removed her hands from Brooke's body and stumbled backwards until there
was an acceptable distance between the two of them, leaving Brooke to clutch
her towel to her body desperately as Jane McPherson walked into the hormone
filled bedroom, completely oblivious to the activities which had been going
on previous to her arrival and the distress that they occupants of the room
were now in.</p>

<p>Spotting Brooke first she gasped, "I didn't know you were in here," a slight
blush coming to her face to match Brooke's own flushed complexion.  "I
thought you were in the shower, although I guess you were…I just wanted to
return this," she went on extending her hand to reveal a book Brooke had
leant her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's alright, you know…the more the merrier," Brooke responded in what
she hoped was a blasé tone, although she shifted her weight uncomfortably
aware of the fact that she could still feel Sam's hands on her and her body
was still reacting like nothing had changed from a few moments before, even
though everything had changed.  She clung to the towel that now hung
precariously on her body more fervently.  "Are you finished already?" she
went on, more for the sake of distracting herself more than anything else as
another shiver ran through her body.</p>

<p>Jane was about to respond to the inquiry when a movement off to the side
caught her eye.  Recalling Brooke's comment about 'the more the merrier' she
was suddenly dying to know and terrified to find out who could possibly have
been in Brooke's room after she showered.  Turning her head slightly she
spotted her daughter standing off to the side, and was relieved but somewhat
confused to see it.</p>

<p>"Sam?" she asked in a tone that was mildly surprised but nothing really more
than that.</p>

<p>"I thought she was in the shower," was Sam's somewhat odd response
considering the tone her mother had implied.  The brunette sounded more like
she was giving testimony than answering a simple greeting.</p>

<p>"What?" Jane asked not quite following her daughters train of thought.</p>

<p>"I came to get my bio text," Sam responded pointing the book lying on the
bed having spotted it a moment before.  Sam knew enough about biology to
know that both she and Brooke were in bad shape at the moment, and watching
Brooke shift and shudder, the flush previously on her skin not going
anywhere, Sam knew too that she had to get herself and her mother out of
there.  "To do homework," she added after that really for no discernable
reason other than she didn't want to be thinking about Brooke's body at the
moment.</p>

<p>"I see," Jane responded returning her attention to Brooke who was fiddling
with her towel trying to tie it again.  "The…" she started to say to the
cheerleader but was cut off by Sam coming up behind her and nudging her.
"What are you doing?" Jane asked in regards to the mini body check Sam had
just given her.  She had seen baby elephants engaged in this type of
behavior on the Discovery Channel before, but it wasn't really as cute
coming from her own child.</p>

<p>"We should go," Sam said gravely.  "She's like naked," she continued looking
at Brooke quickly before turning away.  "We shouldn't be here when she's
almost naked," Sam went on nudging her mother towards the door.  "In America
we don't like nudity, that's why its only on late night TV and pay per view.
  We should definitely go."  And with that both of the McPherson's were
outside and room and Sam quickly turned around and shut the door, her
anxiety level lowering considerably once Brooke was out of sight, and out of
reach.</p>

<p>"You didn't take your book," Jane pointed out once they were in the hallway.</p>

<p>"What book?" Sam asked distractedly.</p>

<p>"Your text book," Jane said watching her daughter.  Sam had been acting
oddly lately, and she was beginning to get suspicious although she didn't
know what she beginning to get suspicious about.  She was however certain
that she was suspicious of something.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," Sam replied.  "I guess I already got my biology lesson for
today," she continued looking back at the door, then smiling uncomfortably
when she realized what she had said and who she had said it to.</p>

<p>"You're a strange child," Jane responded shaking her head.</p>

<p>"I prefer the term eccentric," Sam related.  Jane smiled and drew her arm
around Sam's neck dragging her down the hall.  This meant quality time.  Sam
sighed, it was the perfect end to the perfect night.  "I thought you had a
conference call to Tokyo," Sam commented a moment later unable to resist.
She should have had at least two hours and she was a bit bitter that things
didn't work out that way.</p>

<p>"Oh, that got postponed to tomorrow night…after Mike gets his cast off,"
Jane replied.</p>

<p>"Figures," Sam muttered darkly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Nicole Julian leaned against one of the lockers opposite the Novak idly
looking at her perfectly coiffed nails in between scanning the hallways.
She knew that most people thought of her as cold, unfeeling, and
devastatingly beautiful, and too be sure she was all of those things, but
too many people confused her indifference to her surroundings with an
inability to understand them.  This was a very big mistake, one those
unfortunates usually paid for dearly.  Lately, this underrated power of
observation that Nicole was gifted with had been turned towards her best
friend, Brooke.</p>

<p>She had first noticed a change in Brooke shortly after her father and the
McPherson woman had gone away on vacation, and after the night Brooke had
told her Sam was cooking dinner for her.  For the few days following that
night, Brooke had been very tense, and that apprehension increased
considerably whenever Sam entered a room.  But unease wasn't the only thing
Nicole had noticed during those days, almost more interesting had been the
fact that even though Brooke was quietly hostile-as is her way-towards Sam,
she had been oddly captivated by her, staring almost constantly at her and
speculating out loud what the brunette could have been thinking about.  This
had originally drawn Nicole's attention because she could have cared less
what was going through Spam's infantile little mind, but then maintained her
interest because she was certain Brooke shouldn't have given a flying fuck
what Sam was thinking either and she wanted to know why Brooke had suddenly
taken an interest in the goings on of that particular cranium.</p>

<p>And then, after days of mounting hostility and just when the friction
between the two of them seemed to be reaching its pinnacle, nothing
happened.  At least not of the explosive, earth-shattering variety that
Nicole was rather fond of.  The very next day, not only were things no
longer stressed between the two, but they seemed to be friendly terms.
There was a politeness to their interactions after that, and, Nicole had
noticed with some confusion, a kind of coyness on Brooke's part.  As for
Sam, gone was the perpetually furrowed brow whenever she came into contact
with them, and gone were her constant pissing and moaning about them and her
even more exasperating silent accusations.  There seemed to have been a kind
of peace formed between the two of  them, and Nicole didn't understand or
like it.</p>

<p>And then, came the cancelled gatherings.  Almost every night of the
subsequent week Brooke had cancelled the plans she had previously made with
them.  She had sighted everything from homework, to exhaustion, but Nicole
knew those weren't the real reasons she was canceling.  She had always had
homework and had always been busy, but had never cancelled on them.  To be
doing it so frequently then, was highly suspicious.  She had no concrete
proof, of course, but she was certain that it wasn't a whatever that causing
Brooke to cancel, but a someone and she was certain that someone was Sam.</p>

<p>Her 'it has to be Sam' theory, was momentarily thrown when Brooke had
suddenly shown up at her house one night sporting a hicky and rumpled
clothing she was unaware she was sporting. Nicole had then been forced to
modify her theory slightly coming to the conclusion that Brooke had begun to
secretly date someone-of course she could have merely been fucking someone,
but Nicole knew that wasn't Brook's style-and Sam must know about it which
was why they had changed from enemies to 'frienemies'.  Brooke was just
protecting her interests.</p>

<p>That theory had suited Nicole rather well until the last week or so when she
began to notice something else.  Brooke and Sam weren't simply looking at
each other they were *looking* at each other.  Nicole noticed Brooke's eyes
follow Sam's figure down the hallway much longer than was necessary on many
occasions, not merely tracking her but raking her eyes over her with an
expression-momentary as it always was-of hunger. In addition she noticed Sam
gazing at Brooke across from the other side of rooms-it didn't really matter
which room as long as they were in it together-with a look that Nicole was
forced to describe as 'longing'.</p>

<p>This new information caused another revamping of her theory, or more
accurately a combining of her previous ones.  She hadn't really been wrong
those other times, she just hadn't seen the big picture-which she was
confident she now did.  Brooke's sudden change did have to do with Sam.
Brooke was seeing somebody new and Sam did know about it, because Sam was
the person Brooke was seeing.  This was now known to her, and it was time
for Brooke to explain herself.</p>

<p>Buffing her nails one last time Nicole waited for Brooke to reach her before
pushing off of the locker and grabbing the other girls hand pulling her
towards the Novak.</p>

<p>"Out!  Out!  Get out.  Do I look like a care?  Don't ever wear those shoes
in my presence again, thank you.  Out!  Do I even need to say it?  Goodbye,"
Nicole said as she herded all the occupants of the washroom out of it in
record time.</p>

<p>Following the last of the flock to the door, Nicole slammed it shut knocking
the last of the girls out and locked the door.</p>

<p>"Much better," she exclaimed twirling around dramatically to face Brooke.</p>

<p>"What going on Nic?" Brooke asked wearily.  She had seen this look on
Nicole's face before and wasn't really impressed with the end results when
she had.</p>

<p>"It occurs to me that we really haven't had the time to just down and talk
lately," Nicole started, stopping momentarily to observe her reflection in
the mirror before turning to face Brooke once again.  "And I really think
that we need to talk.  Wait, scratch that...YOU need to talk."</p>

<p>"You're gonna have to be more specific," Brooke responded folding her arms
across her chest defensively.</p>

<p>"Okay," Nicole said her posture tightening and her eyes narrowing a bit.
"When were you going to tell me about you and Lois Lane?"</p>

<p>"Lois Lane?" Brooke asking feigning ignorance even though she knew exactly
who Nicole was talking about.</p>

<p>"Don't fuck with me Brookie, you know who I'm talking about.  Spam, now
spill," Nicole responded moving closer to Brooke, invading her personal
space.</p>

<p>"What about Sam?" Brooke asked with a slight sigh.  She should have seen
this coming.</p>

<p>"Just tell me one thing, have you gotten in her pants yet?" Nicole asked
circling around Brooke like a shark around injured prey.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Brooke asked keeping her gaze forward.  She
had tried to follow Nicole's movements for a while but the way the girl was
moving was just making her dizzy.  She had to stay calm here, focused.  She
couldn't really tell where Nicole was on this and she wanted to try and feel
her out a bit more before admitting anything.  Nicole was a force of nature,
and like most natural occurrences she could and gladly would leave
devastation in her path.  Brooke had seen it before and she knew she would
see it again, and she was absolutely certain that she didn't want to be one
of the objects of Nicole's ferocity.</p>

<p>"I'll admit, it took me longer than it should have," Nicole started slowly,
coming to a stop in front of Brooke.  "But it did come to me.  I've
noticed...how you've changed...and I know why," she practically purred.  "I've
seen you looking at her...the only other time I've seen such raw lust
displayed so openly on a human face was during the Sax's 5th Avenue labour
day sale in '95," she continued, now so close to Brooke they were almost
touching.  "You could as well just hump her leg...it's obvious she's got your
digits and that you've got hers," she concluded backing up a bit to examine
her handy work.</p>

<p>"Nic..." Brooke started, but she was cut off by the shorter blonde's raised
hand.</p>

<p>"I know Brookie...just give it up," Nicole said lowering her hand.</p>

<p>Brooke lowered her eyes from Nicole's and ran a hand through her hair
anxiously.  When she looked back up the answer was written all over her face
and Nicole turned away from her.  Brooke sighed and rubbed at her eyes,
waiting patiently for her friends reaction to her admission.</p>

<p>"You've made things very difficult," Nicole said slowly and softly as she
returned her gaze to Brooke's.  "Do you know what this could mean?" she
asked in a more dangerous tone.</p>

<p>"Of course I know what it could mean," Brooke shot back at her.  "Do you
think I haven't thought about this, that I haven't lost sleep over this...I
know Nic...it's a cataclysmic inconvenience," Brooke went on shaking her head.
  "But I..."</p>

<p>"Couldn't keep your pants on?" Nicole suggested.  Brooke looked over at her
sharply.  Nicole found the reaction very intriguing.  "If you were into
girls we could have found you someone who hasn't made our lives a living
hell and who isn't soon going to be your SISTER!" she went on with
increasing verve.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'found me someone'?" Brooke asked distracted from the
bigger picture momentarily.</p>

<p>"I know people, and you're good looking," Nicole responded absently.  "Some
people actually decide they're not going to fuck everyone they know up the
ass for a roll in the hay," she continued.</p>

<p>"It's not like that," Brooke replied.  "And as hard as it might be for you
to believe, this isn't about you."</p>

<p>"But it is," Nicole said looking at Brooke intently.  "Because whether or
not we want it, I'm your goddamn Rizzo."  There was a hostility in her voice
when she said this that Brooke couldn't help but pick up on.  She opened her
mouth as if she was going to say something, but then quickly shut it again.
She found herself quite at a loss for words.  This conversation wasn't going
how she would have wished it, but it wasn't going as badly as it could have.
  She was relatively certain by this point that Nicole was going to back her
up, all she had to do was not piss the girl off anymore and ride out the
wave.</p>

<p>"Are you in love with her?" Nicole asked finally, breaking the silence
brought on by Brooke's non-answer.  Brooke merely caught her eye in response
then looked away.  "That's just fan-freaking-tastic," Nicole muttered to
herself.  Brooke said nothing.  "This can't get out," Nicole said coming to
stand in front of Brooke.</p>

<p>"I don't want this get out," Brooke responded honestly.  "I don't to be the
real life version of 'But I'm a cheerleader'...I...I just want to be with her,"
she finished softly.  This answer seemed to please Nicole, at least on the
surface.</p>

<p>"That's good," Nicole responded, her voice somewhat distant.  "If you can
control yourself enough not to look at her with those dopey 'fuck-me-eyes'
anymore, things might just work out," and with that she turned away from
Brooke and headed for the door, unlocking and walking out with a smile
before the other girl had a chance to respond or see her expression.</p>

<p>"No, I'm serious," Brooke exclaimed excitedly.  "She has a sense of humor,
she just doesn't know it yet!"</p>

<p>"Yesterday you referred to her as the most fabulously boring person ever to
be noticed for being so utterly and completely unnoticeable," Sam responded
dubiously.  "I remember because I said that your verbiage was excessive and
you stuck your tongue out at me and referred to me as Murphy-freaking-Brown
for the rest of the night."</p>

<p>"Oh that," Brooke responded.  "That was cute though.  Wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded pouting a bit.  "You're going to do it again aren't
you?"</p>

<p>Brooke smiled at that.  "Possibly," she responded.  "At least until you
start to think it's cute."</p>

<p>"Why do you suddenly think she got a sense of humor?" Sam asked changing the
subject.</p>

<p>"I was in English, and I was talking to Random Guy," Sam smiled at that but
said nothing, " so Miss Collins called on Claire to go to the front.  So,
she goes up there and starts to read her composition which is obviously the
most unbelievably boring thing I'd ever heard-including the last
Presidential debates-until she gets to this one part where she stops
mid-sentence and declares 'Hey!  I'm a poet and I didn't even know it!'"
Brooke went on.  "I don't care if it was Claire that said it, that was just
funny."</p>

<p>"I'm a poet and I didn't even know it?" Sam asked trying to contain her
smile.</p>

<p>"I'm a poet and I didn't even know it," Brooke confirmed.</p>

<p>"Ohmygod," Sam exclaimed before dissolving into a fit of laugher.  Brooke
wrapped her arms tighter around the trembling girl in her arms and rested
her chin on Sam's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I told you," she whispered smugly.</p>

<p>"I told you," Sam repeated mockingly twisting her head around so that she
was looking at Brooke.  "I could think of better things for you to be doing
with your lips."</p>

<p>"Why Samantha McPherson," Brooke responded with a faux southern drawl.  "Are
you propositioning me...again?"</p>

<p>"Me?  You're the one who brought me to make-out-point in Archie's jalopy,"
Sam replied.</p>

<p>"Hey, this isn't just any old jalopy, it's like the jalopy's bad-ass cousin
from New York.  It's at least got 30 per cent more 'jal' and 70 per cent
more 'lopy'," Brooke responded.  "And, might I add, it was not easy to
procure this fabulous machine, but I did it for you," she continued before
dipping her head down and gently nipping at Sam's neck.</p>

<p>Sam rolled her head back giving Brooke more access to her neck sighing
contentedly.  "You're very, very good to me," Sam said softly as Brooke's
tongue tickled her skin.  "Are you going to have your way with me now?"</p>

<p>"No," Brooke responded removing her lips from Sam temporarily.  "I didn't
bring you up here to have my way with you, I brought you up here to have you
all to myself," she went on intertwining her fingers with Sam's.  "I've just
missed you."</p>

<p>"I've missed you," Sam replied sincerely.  "Also, I'd like to note that I
would turn around if I could but can't so I won't."</p>

<p>"I've got you," Brooke responded hugging her.</p>

<p>"I know," the brunette said softly.  "I know."</p>

<p>"I didn't realize how much I had gotten used to touching you until I
couldn't anymore," Brooke said a moment later.  "I think it caused a minor
mental situation."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it.  Cagney and Lacy cornered me a few days ago.  Apparently
I've been acting like a speed freak and..." Sam trailed off before she got
into their description of Brooke.</p>

<p>"And," Brooke prompted.</p>

<p>"It's not pretty," Sam warned her.</p>

<p>"I figured as much," Brooke replied.  "Lay it on me."</p>

<p>"You were crowned Princess Bitch-a-lot, sister and right hand to Satan," Sam
related.</p>

<p>"Ouch," Brooke commented.  "Carm?"</p>

<p>"Harrison," Sam replied.</p>

<p>"Figures," Brooke responded knowingly.  "I should apologize, shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"It's what Britney or Christina would do," Sam answered with a smile before
tilting her head back and bringing her lips and Brooke's together.</p>

<p>Once they separated Brooke sighed softly and rested her head on Sam's
shoulder, unconsciously tightening the hold she had on the brunette.  They
sat in silence like that for a moment before Sam couldn't take it anymore.
Brooke had been acting like this all night, most of the time she fine but
then she would get very quiet and hug Sam to her almost as if she thought
the brunette were going to float away.  It was starting to worry Sam.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Sam asked quietly, placing her hands over top Brooke's
stroking them lightly as she waited for Brooke's answer.</p>

<p>"She knows.  Nicole, she knows about us," Brooke related hurriedly, before
she could lose her courage; the only part of her body to move at all being
her lips.  Sam's eyes widened at the revelation.  She knew that Brooke had
been hesitant to tell her friend, and knowing Nicole Sam knew exactly why
she had been hesitant.  Nicole Julian was the reason for the saying 'keep
your friends close and your enemies closer'.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Sam asked instinctively knowing that Brooke hadn't been the
one to inform Nicole of the situation.</p>

<p>"She just...saw it I guess.  You know what she's like, she got suspicious and
started collecting clues.  I think I'm going to have to face the fact that I
stare at you far to much...I thought I was being stealthy but apparently not,"
Brooke answered dejectedly.</p>

<p>"How'd she react?" Sam questioned gently.  From the way Brooke was acting
she almost feared the answer.</p>

<p>"Alright, I suppose," Brooke said finally raising her head from it's resting
place.  "She was forward, as expected.  Abrasive, as expected.  And
insulting, once again as expected, but she seemed to be okay with it."  Sam
was less than comforted by this answer.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?  She didn't outright threaten you?" the brunette
asked.</p>

<p>"Basically," Brooke responded sighing again and replacing her head.  "I've
just got a bad feeling about it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She was too nice, Sam," Brooke mumbled in response.  "It was like
Nicole-lite, like she was warming up or something.  I don't know," she
finished shaking her head.</p>

<p>Sam squeezed Brooke's hand reassuringly.  "We'll just have to wait and see,
there's nothing else we can do," she said still holding onto Brooke.
"Complex mess of complications," she continued feeling Brooke smile against
the skin of her neck.</p>

<p>"Complex mess of complications," Brooke repeated as her hands began to make
their way under Sam's shirt and her lips attached to the brunette's neck.</p>

<p>"I want to see you," Sam mumbled softly as she began to struggle in Brooke's
arms.  She had tried to turn around once before, but she was only playing
then.  Now she was serious and nothing was going to stop her.</p>

<p>Placing her hands on Sam's waist Brooke loosened her hold on Sam helping the
other girl turn around so that they were face to face.  However it soon
became clear to them that they wouldn't be able to stay in that position
very long, so Brooke reached back pressing the release button on the seat,
folding it down then shifted her position so that she was lying on her back,
one of her legs braced on the floor and the other resting on the seat with
Sam in between.</p>

<p>Sam slid her hands up Brooke's thighs until they came to rest on the
brunette's hips.  Once she had reached her intended destination she then
slowly traced her finger along the seam of Brooke's pants until she reached
the button which she quickly popped open with a smile.  Once that was taken
care of, Sam grasped the tip of Brooke's zipper and slowly slid it down
before beginning to drag her hands up Brooke's abdomen once again, this time
taking the hem of her shirt with her.</p>

<p>Having dragged the shirt half way up Brooke's chest Sam left it where it was
and shifted her position so that she was lying instead of sitting in between
Brooke's leg and lowered her mouth to the smooth skin of Brooke's stomach.
She then traced her teeth on a downwards path along the smooth expanse of
skin until she reached the waist band of Brooke's panties, which she
sensuously dipped her tongue under before licking a path up towards Brooke's
navel.   Brooke arched up into Sam's mouth as the brunette continued to
tease her in the most delicious of ways, an almost guttural moan escaping
from her lips.</p>

<p>"I know," Sam began her hands slipping underneath Brooke and around to her
back, "that you said you weren't going to have your way with me," she
continued as she deftly unclasped the blonde's bra. "But I," she went on
brining her hand back to the front of Brooke's body, "made no such promise."
  And with that she slid up Brooke's body heatedly pressing their lips
together as her hand slipped under Brooke's now unclasped bra to massage the
tender mound of flesh underneath.</p>

<p>Brooke bucked up into Sam's busy hands, groaning into the kiss as her own
hands began to roam over Sam's body frantically.</p>

<p>Sam broke the contact between their lips momentarily as she freed Brooke
from the confines of her shirt, despite the blondes muttered please of
disapproval at the loss of contact between them.  Then once that was done,
Sam once again returned her lips to Brooke's hungrily as both of their hands
began to roam once more.</p>

<p>
Brooke's body quivered upon hearing the sound torn from Sam as the blonde
worked her leg in between the brunettes, and she gasped ecstatically when
she felt Sam press down against her and nip at her neck desperately.
Brooke's body then began to tremble violently as she felt Sam slide down on
he thigh until the brunette's groin was resting snugly against her hips and
her hand slipped under the waistband of Brooke's panties towards the center
of her molten hot desire.</p>

<p>As Sam slowly entered her, Brooke's eyes fluttered shut and her lips parted
sensuously, a low, sexy moan escaping from deep within her throat as Sam
began to move within her.  As Brooke's hips rose to meet Sam's questing
fingers she could feel the brunette grinding against her hip bone urgently
as she sucked on her bottom lip and her breath came in shallow pants.</p>

<p>Brooke reached up desperately bringing her hand to the side of Sam's face,
and ran her thumb across her lips tenderly before leaning up and crushing
their lips together as Sam entered her one last time and Brooke tensed,
moaning her release into Sam's mouth as her body began and shake intensely.</p>

<p>A moment later Brooke felt Sam stiffen as well; lovingly holding onto the
girl as her body quaked and her breathing hitched before her eyes fluttered
shut and she collapsed on top of the cheerleader, where they stayed together
as their breathing calmed and their hearts slowed back to their normal
paces.</p>

<p>Once she felt that she once again had control of her faculties, Brooke
raised her hand to Sam's forehead-which was nestled against her shoulder-and
brushed back a few arrant strands of dark hair before pressing her lips to
Sam's temple softly.</p>

<p>"I hope you know," Brooke began softly as she ran her hand along Sam's back
soothingly, "that Sugar Daddy is never going to let me borrow his truck
again," she finished gravely.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence after Brooke spoke that was then interrupted
as Sam began to laugh burying her face even deeper into Brooke's neck and
hugging the blonde towards her.</p>

<p>Josh followed Nicole reluctantly to a fairly empty area of the school-one
that became completely empty after Nicole worked her unique brand of magic.
The blonde had sought him out after his last class and essentially ordered
him to follow her, and, like all people who knew her, he listened to her
because, quite frankly he was afraid.  It was a manly fear to be certain,
but it was fear nonetheless.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked somewhat reluctantly.  He was certain that whatever
she was about to say would end up causing some sort of problem in the near
future.</p>

<p>"It's about Brooke," Nicole started timidly which immediately put him on the
defensive.  "I'm worried about her," the blonde continued looking up at Josh
through her eye lashes coyly.</p>

<p>After their talk in the Novak Nicole had given some very serious thought to
the situation at hand.  Brooke was her friend, and really loyal like a puppy
when it came down it, because Brooke was essentially a good person.
Certainly she could be manipulated into doing things that went against her
instincts, but for the most part she was concerned with others feeling and
didn't want to hurt other people so that she herself could benefit.  This
contrast in Brooke was the reason she was the queen-bee, she could be nasty
when she needed to be, but was also essentially likeable.  Add to that the
fact that she was unquestionable beautiful and it all equaled immense
popularity.  This had served Nicole well over the years, but it was now time
to question the order of operation.</p>

<p>While Nicole herself had benefited greatly from Brooke's popularity by being
her best friend, she had also worked extremely hard to get where she was.
She had gone from being worse than a nobody to the girl everybody wanted to
be or at least feared.  She liked the upgrade and she wasn't willing to give
it up for the sake of Brooke's libido.  However, she did feel some sort of
obligation to her sister in arms which is why she wasn't content to simply
break ties with Brooke and destroy her.  She was going to offer the head
cheerleader a chance to redeem herself.  If Brooke accepted it, then so be
it, however if she denied the opportunity that was so graciously being
offered her Nicole wouldn't hesitate to take her down and step over the
corpse to take the crown.</p>

<p>"She seems fine to me...a little tense, but other than that," Josh responded
trailing off.  However, despite his answer he wondered if something really
was going on with Brooke.  Since they had broken up they hadn't spoken as
much as they used to, and especially lately Brooke had been keeping to
herself.</p>

<p>"I don't think that she's handled your break-up well at all," Nicole related
with a touch of sadness.  "I think it's really messed her up."</p>

<p>"She's the one that broke-up with me," Josh responded somewhat dismally.  It
was still a sore spot for him.</p>

<p>"I know," Nicole said soothingly, "but I think she just did it because she
was confused, and now she doesn't know what to do.  Sometimes I don't even
recognize her anymore, it's like she's made a complete 180.  Especially now
that..." she trailed off removing her eyes from Josh's and off to the side.</p>

<p>"Now that what?" Josh asked curiously.  He hadn't noticed that big a change
in Brooke, in fact she had seemed quite happy.</p>

<p>"It's just...it's as if she's decided that if she couldn't have you she was
going to give up on men altogether," Nicole said forcing a note of alarm
into her voice.</p>

<p>"Give up men?"</p>

<p>"I know, crazy but true," Nicole replied.  "I...I don't know if I should say
it...it's just sooo...oh I don't know," she said dragging him along.  She was
enjoying this.</p>

<p>"You can tell me, you know I love her," Josh said pleadingly.  He just had
to know what was wrong with her.  Even if they weren't going out anymore
they were still friends, at least he thought they were.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, how about a month ago Brooke was acting very anxious?"
Nicole asked as her mind raced trying to figure out how exactly she wanted
to drop the bomb.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Josh responded simply.</p>

<p>"Well, you know she and Sam were alone in the house at that time," Nicole
continued.  Josh simply nodded his agreement.  Brooke had talked to him
about how she was dreading being alone with Sam.  "Well, I think that she
may have turned to Sam for comfort, you know tried to bond with her," Nicole
went on.  "But I think Sam comforted her too much."</p>

<p>"I'm not following you," Josh replied.  If Brooke and Sam were getting
along-which they seemed to be doing-that was a good thing, or at least he
thought it was.</p>

<p>"They became engaged," Nicole started carefully.  "Romantically.  Sam
comforted Brooke in her bed," she went on gravely.</p>

<p>"What!?!" Josh exclaimed.  "That's insane.  Brooke's not...gay," he said his
voice dropping secretively as he said that last word.  "She wouldn't...not
with Sam of all people!"</p>

<p>"But she did and she is.  That's why I came to you.  She doesn't know what
she's doing Josh.  She just wanted somebody to love her after you broke up.
But," Nicole said almost giddy to finally be getting to the climax of her
operation.  "if you go to her now, and ask her to take you back, I know you
can help her.  This...aberration with Sam, if it goes on much longer people
will find out.  Can you imagine what would happen?  With Brooke so
vulnerable?  Hell, Spam is probably going to write an editorial about it!
We can't let this ruin her Josh, you have to help straighten her out again,"
Nicole finished dramatically.</p>

<p>"I don't know...I...this is all so," Josh started his mind reeling with
everything Nicole had just told him.</p>

<p>"Josh," she said.  "There's no time for this."</p>

<p>"I'll try," he said finally straightening up.</p>

<p>"No Josh, don't try...DO," Nicole said, her voice hardening a bit now that she
knew she had him.  "You have to fix her, or else things aren't going to be
pleasant for anyone."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" Josh asked seeing the Nicole he knew and feared
starting to rear her head again.</p>

<p>"Brooke won't be the only one to go down if this gets out, I can't allow
that to happen.  Think about it, if everyone finds out that Brooke's
diddling her step-sister what will that say about you?  If our homecoming
queen and head cheerleader is a lipstick lesbian, what does that mean about
our homecoming king and star quarterback?"</p>

<p>"I'm not..." Josh started, but Nicole interrupted him.</p>

<p>"I know that but they don't. o you think that anybody thinks that Brooke is?
  You used to date her, what do you think people are going to think.  And
then there's the Glamazons, we'll all be linked by association like it was
some sort of gay sewing circle.  Do you want to go down like that?" Nicole
asked getting right up in his face.</p>

<p>"No," was his only response.</p>

<p>"Then win her back and do it soon," Nicole responded, and with that she
walked away leaving a dumbfounded Josh staring into space.</p>

<p>It only took Josh a couple of minutes to locate Brooke before practice
started.  The Glamazons were practicing so he knew that she had to be
around.  He wasn't prepared for the sight that greeted him however, although
he supposed that he should have been given his chat with Nicole.  Brooke was
dressed in her uniform and was standing off to the side of the bleachers,
with Sam.  Brooke had her head tilted away from him but he could tell that
she was laughing, and Sam had her hand up by her face obviously laughing as
well.  They were standing closer to each other than was necessary, or even
really acceptable in some circles-a particularly noteworthy event
considering that they didn't used to be able to occupy the same room.  It
became painfully clear to him that Nicole was on the right track about the
two of them.  Immediately he head over to the two of them.</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke said spotting him coming towards them.  She was still smiling
and Josh couldn't help but think that she didn't look like someone who was
an emotional wreck.  Still he had his mission, when coach called a play you
executed it even if you did have doubts.</p>

<p>"Hey," he replied with a smile of his own.  "Sam," he said turning to the
brunette.  She in turn offered him a little smile and a salute.  "I just
need to borrow her a minute," he continued gesturing towards Brooke before
resting his hand on her back and pushing her away.  Doing such he missed
Sam's raised eyebrow and Brooke's amused shrug.</p>

<p>"You know, I am capable of walking on my own," Brooke commented once they
were a safe distance away.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Josh commented distractedly.  He was eyeing Sam who had taken out a
notebook and was writing something in it, his mind involuntarily going back
to Nicole's comment about Sam writing an expository on Brooke.  He frowned.</p>

<p>"Is everything already?" Brooke asked looking at the boy carefully.  Even
though things hadn't worked out between them, she still cared deeply for him
and was disturbed by the idea that something might be wrong with him.</p>

<p>"No," he said his voice wavering a bit.  "Things are just…I mean I know that
we're not…anymore…but I really need to talk to you."</p>

<p>"You know I'm here for you," Brooke responded sincerely.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Josh responded although he sounded less than convinced.  "I can't
talk about it here though…could you come by later?" he asked gazing at
Brooke with puppy dog eyes.</p>

<p>Brooke observed him for a minute.  He had been so despondent after she had
broken up with him, and really had never bounced back to his previous self,
and for that she felt terribly guilty.</p>

<p>"Of course," she responded, happy to see him smile.</p>

<p>"Great," he responded.  "I'll see you later then," and with that he headed
off towards the field and Brooke walked back over to where Sam was waiting
for her.</p>

<p>"I swear to god I thought it was tofu," Carmyn exclaimed pleadingly.</p>

<p>"It was chicken!" Lily shot back.  "I'm a vegetarian."</p>

<p>"I know, I know…which was why I was happy when I thought it was tofu," Carm
responded.  "The menu said tofu, it looked like tofu…it tasted like chicken,
but so does everything!"</p>

<p>"Hello ladies," Harrison said walking up to his bickering friends
unknowingly saving Carmyn's hide.</p>

<p>"You're awfully chipper this afternoon," Lily commented.</p>

<p>"That's because it's been a very good day," Harrison responded smiling
broadly.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" Carm asked knowingly.</p>

<p>"I think you know," Harrison replied.</p>

<p>"Oh no," Carm and Lily replied together.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the encouragement," Harrison responded frowning slightly.  "I'll
have you know that this very afternoon Brooke tracked me down and apologized
for what happened, not only bestowing upon my a dazzling smile but also a
hug," Harrison said quite pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"You know that we're here for you, and that we'd encourage you in an
obtainable venture, but Brooke?  You've been after her since third
grade…you've got to face the facts, it's never going to happen," Carmyn told
him as gently as possible.</p>

<p>"Come one, have a little faith," Harrison responded.  "The stars are all in
alignment right now.  Brooke and I have never gotten along better, we're
both single, and I've been working out," he continued.  "It's as close to
destiny as I'm gonna get."</p>

<p>"So close and yet so far," Lily muttered under her breath before addressing
him directly.  "She's not as single as you might think.  The cards are still
stacked against you," she said ignoring the look Carm shot her.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Harrison asked, he hadn't heard about Brooke
hooking up with anyone after Josh.</p>

<p>"There's a prospect," Carm responded cryptically.  "She's off the market."</p>

<p>"How do you two know about this and I don't?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"We kind of stumbled across the information, but we've been sworn to
secrecy," Carm responded.  "We've only said this much because we didn't want
to see you get hurt."</p>

<p>"Who?" Harrison asked desperate to know who had beaten him to the punch.</p>

<p>"We've crossed our hearts and hoped to die," Lily responded.  "We can't
say."</p>

<p>After that Harrison proceeded to badger them for a few more minutes but they
wouldn't budge from their position.</p>

<p>"You know what?  This blows!" he responded.  "I'll find out myself," and
with that he stormed off down the hall.</p>

<p>"Oh boy," Carm muttered once he was gone.  "This isn't going to be pretty."</p>

<p>"Definitely not," Lily confirmed.</p>

<p>"I didn't think that it would be so cold out," Josh commented as he spotted
Brooke rubbing her hands together.  Once Brooke had arrived he had suggested
they take a walk around the golf course adjacent to his house since he
really didn't want to have a run in with his parents.  "Here," he continued
stopping and reaching over for her hands pulling them into his and rubbing
them briskly.  "We could go back if you want."</p>

<p>"It's okay," Brooke responded lightly.  "I like it out here."</p>

<p>"Yeah me too," he said letting go of her hands and turning back around.</p>

<p>"I remember," Brooke responded dropping her head slightly as they began to
walk again.  "How are things with your mother?" she questioned finally,
assuming that his family problems were the reason he had asked her to meet
him.</p>

<p>Josh rubbed his neck uncomfortably and scrunched his face up at the
question.  "It's…not good," he said slowly.  "He just doesn't get her…or
me…it's like he's still in the days of black and white TV."  He paused there
working up the courage to continue.  "I think…maybe that's why it was so
hard for me when we broke up…because I thought we had what they didn't, I
thought we got each other," he went on slyly checking on Brooke's reaction.</p>

<p>"I think that we did…that we do," Brooke responded slowly, carefully.  "But
relationships aren't that simple," she continued.</p>

<p>"I know," Josh replied just as carefully.  "That's why people have to work
at them, which is why a lot of them don't work out," he continued keeping
his gaze on the grass beneath his feet.  "I've just been thinking about this
a lot, and I was thinking that we could work on ours, we both have strong
work ethics in regards to everything else so why not this," he continued
finally looking up at her.</p>

<p>"Josh…" Brooke started, he knew what she was going to say and interrupted
her.</p>

<p>"Just hear me out," he stated though there was a somewhat pleading tone to
his voice.  "We're both still not seeing anyone," he continued even though
they both knew it was a lie, "and I'm not saying that we have to jump back
in right away, just that we were good together, and think that we could be
again.  I miss you, and I think that we could be like romantic friends or
something like that anyway until it was just romantic again, you know?"</p>

<p>"You know I care about you so much," Brooke said ceasing to walk.  "But…"
Once again Josh knew where this going, at least in regards to him.  She was
going to tell him that they should stay friends, he needed to pre-empt that,
so he did the thing that he thought would make the most sense, he closed the
distance between them and kissed her.</p>

<p>Brooke was stunned at the first touch of Josh's lips to hers, she truly
hadn't seen that one coming.  After a moment however, she realized what was
going on, and that when she hadn't pulled away Josh had started to deepen
the kiss.  And as they stood there together, Josh's lips pressed against
hers all she could think about was how she felt absolutely nothing, how
although Josh was many things and a great guy he wasn't Sam, and he would
never be able to make her feel how Sam made her feel, and she wrenched her
lips away from his.</p>

<p>"Don't do that again," Brooke said in a low, warning tone once they had
separated.</p>

<p>Josh was quiet for a moment, looking down at his shoes once more.  Despite
Brooke's words he was comforted by what he assumed to be her positive
response to the kiss.  For the first time since talking to Nicole he began
to believe fully that Brooke was just with Sam because he wasn't around.
Why else would she have let him kiss her for as long as she did?  He decided
to play the cards that he held in his hand, to let Brooke know that it was
okay, and that he'd take her back despite what she'd done with Sam.</p>

<p>"We should be with people that we love, not just with anyone who's around or
who'll give us what we temporarily need," Josh said quietly a moment later.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked beyond confused by his response.</p>

<p>"I know that you're seeing someone," he continued ignoring her question,
"that you were lonely after we broke up, but you shouldn't let pride ruin
you or blind you to what's happening around you."</p>

<p>"If I'm seeing someone," Brooke started carefully still not sure what to
make of Josh's cryptic speak, "it's a decision I made.  Not out of
loneliness, not out of pride, and not out of fear, but because I wanted to,"
she continued firmly, confident at least in the statement of her own
feelings.</p>

<p>"Because you wanted to," Josh repeated, mostly for his own benefit, but
Brooke picked up on it.</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to," Brooke repeated confidently.  She didn't want to hurt
Josh, but she didn't want to give him false hope either.  She couldn't have
him walking around thinking that there was a chance for them.</p>

<p>"But Nicole…" Josh started to say looking up at Brooke with shinning eyes,
he trailed off however, not sure if wanted to continue.</p>

<p>"But Nicole what?" Brooke asked with a strong sense of foreboding.  "Please
Josh," she asked when she saw him hesitate.</p>

<p>"Nicole said that reason you were with her was because you missed me," Josh
responded not able to keep all of the hurt and accusation hidden.  "She said
that you were upset…and Sam comforted you 'too well'," he went on.</p>

<p>"She told you?  About Sam?" Brooke asked slightly stunned.</p>

<p>"She said I needed to straighten you back out or there would be
unpleasantness, she said it was for your own good, that Sam was taking
advantage of you.  She never said that…it was your decision.  I didn't know
that you wanted…" he trailed off and turned his head away from her the pain
that he was in so clearly written over his face and in his voice.</p>

<p>Brooke stood by watching him helplessly, she was torn up inside seeing him
like that.  Finally, she crossed the few steps separating them and reached
out to him, drawing him into a hug.  She had never wanted to hurt him, and
she had loved him, did love him in a way.  She just wasn't in love with him,
and not for the first time she was overcome with guilt for it.  She should
have loved him, they were perfect for each other, everyone had said so.  But
it didn't work out that way, and not for the first time she wondered why.</p>

<p>Finally, Josh pulled himself together and moved away from Brooke.  "You're
not going to take me back are you?" he asked even though it was clear from
his tone that he already knew the answer.</p>

<p>"No," she replied as gently as she could while rejecting him once more.  "I
can't," she said deciding to leave it at that feeling that to tell him she
loved Sam would be rubbing salt into an open wound.</p>

<p>"Nicole," Josh said straightening his shoulders.  "She'll take you down if
you stay with Sam," he continued.  "She says it'll ruin all of us, not just
you.  I got the distinct impression that after me the only game plan was
seek and destroy."</p>

<p>Brooke listened to his words and knew with certainty that he was telling the
truth.  It only confirmed what she secretly feared and the feeling that had
been rattling her ever since her encounter with Nicole in the Novak.  Still,
even though she shouldn't have been surprised as this was classic Nicole
Julian, she couldn't help feeling extremely hurt and betrayed.  She felt
tears come to her eyes and turned her head away from Josh trying to blink
them out as she wrestled with her emotions.</p>

<p>"Et tu, Josh?" she asked finally, a tear running down her cheek even as she
turned to face him.  "What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say," Josh started softly.  "That I wish you could have loved me half as
much as I love you.  I say, I wish that Nicole had never come to me and told
me what she knew. I say that even though it's tearing me up inside, if
you're happy, then I'll do what I can though I have no idea what that could
be.  And finally, I say that the past ten hours have really, really blown,"
he concluded.</p>

<p>Brooke reached out a hand and placed her on his face when he had finished.
"Thank you," she said softly, her voice cracking with emotion.  He shrugged
stoically simply observing her for a moment.</p>

<p>"She'll do it you know," he said finally.  "She'll do it in front of the
whole school gleefully."</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke said dropping her gaze and her hand.  "She's been waiting
for this, to usurp the crown.  She wants to be Sandra Dee and I've given her
just what she needs," Brooke responded finally seeing the reason behind the
hostility in Nicole's voice when she had referred to herself as Brooke's
Rizzo.  Nicole had risen through the ranks like a superstar, but once she
got to a certain point there was nowhere for her to go because Brooke was
standing in front of her, and as long as Brooke was there, Nicole would
always be number two, and second place was never good enough for Nicole
Julian, she was a gold medallist-even if she had to lie, cheat and steal to
get to the podium.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"  Josh asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," Brooke replied honestly.  "How does one go about
thwarting an evil genius?" she asked before chuckling darkly.  "It's funny,
I don't know how to defend my position because I've never had to.  Nicole's
always been there in the trenches flinging mud at anyone who came near,
snapping at their heels for me.  Only now she's flinging it at me, and I
think that she's out of my league," Brooke finished wearily, dejectedly.</p>

<p>They stood in silence for a moment after that, each of them considering what
a victory for Nicole would entail and shuddering at the thought of such a
bleak future.  "I've gotta try though," Brooke said finally.  "But I'll need
your help."  Josh simply nodded his agreement.  "I need to buy some time,"
she said in response to his nod.  "Just tell her that you think that her
plan's working and I'll take care of the rest," she continued although she
really had no idea what on earth she was going to or could do.</p>

<p>It was just past nine by the time Brooke made it back home, the walk between
her house and Josh's having passed by in a blur.  Her mind was spinning with
everything that had happened in not only the past few weeks or days, but the
past few hours.  Everything that had happened came clashing together in her
mind painfully, making her head pound and  her heart contract agonizingly
every time she took a breath. She felt like everything was falling apart
right before her eyes, and she couldn't help the fact that her mind kept
wondering back to times before, times when things were if not simple then at
least easier. She wondered what had possessed her to think that she could
get away with colouring outside lines, that thinking outside of the box
would bring anything but trouble, misery and destruction.  Everything she
knew was on the verge of collapse, her whole life was hanging on the edge of
some precipice she had seen herself approaching but disregarded until it was
too late.  Now all of the players were on the stage and all the cards had
been laid out and all eyes were on her.  And, she discovered, at this
critical moment, she suddenly found that the only thing she was sure of was
that she wasn't sure of anything anymore.  In fact, the only thing that
seemed to be going at all her way was that by the time she got home everyone
had just finished eating dinner, which meant she would be spared the agony
of having to sit through it on this particular night.</p>

<p>Making a little wave to three people gathered in the kitchen she then made a
bee-line for the stairs offering no other acknowledgement of their presence.
  Once she had reached the landing she made a movement to her left towards
her door, then stopped.  Although she had initially ignored it, almost the
moment after she had passed the kitchen she had become aware that someone
had started after her.  She knew who it was, and that it probably would have
been easier for her to just continue on into her room, but she just
couldn't, so once she stopped she slowly turned around and waited for Sam to
catch up with her.</p>

<p>"Is everything alright?" Sam asked watching the blonde carefully.</p>

<p>"I'm just tired," Brooke responded evading the question and Sam's eyes by
looking at the wall just beyond her.  "I'll see you in the morning," she
continued a moment later seizing the opportunity presented by Sam's
momentary silence.  With that she started to turn around and head towards
her room, but something stopped her before she had actually began to move
again and compelled her to turn back towards Sam.  Closing the small
distance between them Brooke placed her hand on Sam's cheek then leaned in
pressing her lips to the brunette's drawing her into a brief, confused
kiss, that was desperate, and sad, and longing all at once.  Then pulling
away from the other girl, Brooke immediately turned around and made her
exit.</p>

<p>Sam watched Brooke's retreating figure worriedly, her eyes trailing the
other girl all the way into her room.  On a normal day this type of
desolate, anti-social behavior would have worried the brunette, but
considering the fact that Brooke had already been tense because of Nicole's
reaction to them, and the fact that she had just come back from a *long*
midnight stroll with her ex-boyfriend, Sam was beyond worried.  Sighing the
brunette ran a hand through her hair restlessly, then headed for her own
room deciding that the entire situation sucked to high heaven.</p>

<p>Sam sat sullenly at the lunch table listening to the others talk with only
half an ear.  Her attention was mostly focused on moodily rolling an apple
from one hand to the other and observing Brooke from across the room.  The
blonde had been distant that morning, just like the night before; the only
interest she showed in Sam being the extensive lengths she had gone to to
avoid the brunette.  It had changed the bad feeling she had had the previous
night into a nauseous feeling in the morning that had steadily gotten worse
throughout the day, and was reaching it's climax now that she observed
Brooke sitting beside Josh-her proximity not at all congruent with their
'ex' status-smiling at Josh, and generally-in her opinion-just fawning over
him.  She felt like she was going to be sick.</p>

<p>"Well, you were right about Brooke," Harrison said addressing Lily and
Carmen but drawing Sam's attention to him as well, probably for the first
time since they had sat down to eat.  "She's off the market again," he went
on oblivious to the wide-eyed look Sam was sending at him.  "You," he said
finally turning to the gaping brunette but not registering her expression,
"could have told me.  How could you have kept quiet about this?"</p>

<p>Sam simply stared at him blankly in response.  Harrison looked at her oddly,
but upon receiving only silence her continued to address the other occupants
of the table.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I'm surprised," he went on, "it's like they were destined
to be together, it's just so perfect," he continued shaking his head.</p>

<p>"They are?" Carmyn and Lily asked in unison, both perfectly surprised by how
well Harrison was taking the new considering how he had reacted during the
whole situation with his mother.</p>

<p>"Brooke and Josh?  Come on, it's like Ken and Barbie!  We all should have
known they'd get back together," he responded.</p>

<p>"Brooke and Josh," Carmyn repeated genuinely confused.  "What are you
talking about?"  She had expected Sam to pipe up sometime during the
conversation, but upon looking at the other girl she wasn't even sure that
the conversation was registering with her.</p>

<p>"You can give it up now," Harrison said wondering why they would still be
trying to keep it a secret.  In fact he still hadn't figured out why they
were keeping Brooke's secrets at all, but that was besides the point at the
moment.  "I was returning Josh's putter today and I heard him and Nicole
talking.  Apparently he and Brooke went on a romantic moonlight stroll last
night and she totally gave into him on the golf course.  Josh mentioned
tongue, but I don't think there's any need to get into that," he continued.
"Isn't that just so movie of the week?"</p>

<p>"Sam," Lily asked softly noticing the other girls eyes squeeze shut, a
single tear emerging from underneath and running down her face.  The only
response she got however, was as Sam stumbled up and out of her
chair-knocking it over in the process which drew looks from around the room,
including the popular table-and staggered out of the room.</p>

<p>Carmyn and Lily immediately turned to look at Brooke who seemed to follow
Sam's progress, a haunted look momentarily passing across her face, but she
diverted her attention once again.  It soon became clear to Carmyn that
Brooke was not going to get up and go after Sam, like she had somewhat
idealistically assumed she would, so she herself stood up and made her way
out of the room and after her friend.</p>

<p>"What was that about?" Harrison asked Lily in an utterly confused tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I know it's not good," was Lily's soft reply.</p>

<p>Brooke unceremoniously dropped her bag in the hallway once she got home and
headed into the kitchen.  Her day had been utter crap, and if she were in a
movie she would have darkly stated that she needed a drink.  Upon entering
the kitchen and finding it already occupied she almost turned right around
but she had been spotted and was addressed before she could make her exit.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Jane asked resting the paper she had been reading on the table
top.  Brooke pasted a smile across her face and walked over to the table
sitting opposite Jane as she mumbled some greeting to the older woman.</p>

<p>"I know I'm old and unhip and that it's no longer cool for kids today to
talk to adults about how their days went, but, I was wondering if something
happened at school today?" she asked tentatively.</p>

<p>"Why would think that?" Brooke asked, forcing a note of curiosity into her
voice.</p>

<p>"Sam came home during lunch with Carmyn.  She looked very shaken up…I think
she had been crying, and now she's barricaded herself up in her room.  The
only evidence I've got that she's till alive up there is that she started
playing Patsy Cline on a continuous loop after Carmyn left," Jane related
worriedly.</p>

<p>"I don't…I mean I haven't really seen her all day," Brooke responded
haltingly, a cold wave passing through her body.</p>

<p>"I know it's asking a lot, but she won't talk to me, and I know that the two
of you have become friends…and I was wondering if you'd try," Jane replied.</p>

<p>"It's not that…I mean it's not a lot to ask…I just don't think that she
wants to talk to me," Brooke said softly, guiltily, however Jane interpreted
the tone as modesty and pressed on.</p>

<p>"I'm just really very worried about her," she went on shaking her head
despondently.  "The last time she played Patsy Cline was after her…" Jane
trailed off there momentarily, but Brooke instinctively knew what the end of
the sentence was: "was after her father died", was what Jane had been about
to say.  "If you could just check on her…" Jane continued a second later.</p>

<p>"I…I'll see what I can do," Brooke responded, then hastily got up making her
exit.</p>

<p>Brooke ran an unsteady hand through her hair, tugging at it nervously.  She
had messed up, she had screwed up really badly and know she was dreading
what had to be done to at least try and make it better.  She had been so
concerned with her own thoughts and fears, so introverted after speaking
with Josh that she didn't realize what it would look like to Sam.  She had
known that if Nicole was going to hold off on her campaign of terror she
would have to make it look like she really had begun to take Josh back, that
she had to play the part of soon-to-be girlfriend to him, only Sam didn't
know she was playing a part.  'She didn't know because you didn't tell her',
the little voice at the back of Brooke's head whispered to her.  Brooke
shook her head.  That had been a minor major oversight.  But as she paced
the hallway outside Sam's door, she knew that she wasn't being perfectly
honest with herself.  She had wanted the best of both worlds.  Pretending to
be back together with Josh was a dishonest way for her to try and figure out
if she could take him back, if she could take the road most traveled and be
marginally happy in breeder land without jeopardizing what she had with Sam
while doing it.  She had wanted the best of both worlds and it had blown up
in her face, big time.</p>

<p>Gathering her courage she raised her hand and knocked at the door.  There
was no reply, which didn't really surprise her.  She opened her mouth as if
to call out, but suddenly closed it thinking better of the situation.  If
Sam knew that it was her outside the door she might shove a dresser or
something in front of the door before Brooke could get a chance to talk to
her.  Instead she decided that it would be best if she just let herself in.
The lock on Sam's door was old and slightly defective if you knew it's weak
points which Brooke did.</p>

<p>Heading into her room she grabbed a hair pin from off of her dresser then
made her way back to Sam's door.  After a moment of fiddling with the lock
she heard the door click open and pushed her way inside.</p>

<p>The room was dark, and upon entering the only sound that Brooke could detect
was the mournful sounds of Patsy Cline.  As Brooke scanned the room for Sam,
the words coming from the radio flittered into her brain making her heart
heavy with guilt for what she had done.</p>

<p align=center><i>Crazy<br>
      Crazy for feeling so lonely<br>
      I'm crazy<br>
      Crazy for feeling so blue</i></p>

<p align=center><i>I knew<br>
      You'd love me as long as you wanted<br>
      And then someday<br>
      You'd leave me for somebody new</i></p>
<p align=center><i>Worry<br>
      Why do I let myself worry<br>
      Wond'rin'<br>
      What in the world did I do</i></p>
<p align=center><i>Crazy<br>
      For thinking that my love could hold you<br>
      I'm crazy for tryin'<br>
      Crazy for cryin'<br>
      And I'm crazy<br>
      For lovin' you</i></p>

<p>Finally Brooke spotted Sam sitting in the corner of the room between her bed
and the wall next to Sir Hugglesworth: The Most Cuddliest Bear In The Whole
Wide World-or so a five year old Sam McPherson had deemed him many years
ago.  As Brooke approached the brunette she could feel Sam's eyes on her,
watching her with a brutal intensity that she felt she absolutely deserved.</p>

<p>"Sam," she said softly, her voice splintering near the end.  At the sound of
her voice she saw Sam's eyes close almost painfully, a tear streaking down
her face as she hugged her knees closer to her body.  As Brooke watched her
she felt her own eyes begin to tear not for the first time that day, and she
knelt down, instinctively reaching out to brush the tears from Sam's cheek.</p>

<p>The moment her fingers made contact with Sam's skin, Sam flinched away from
her touch, turning her head, before bringing her own hand up a moment later
to bat Brooke's hand away.  "Don't touch me," she whispered harshly, her
voice breaking with every syllable she uttered.  Until that day, Sam had
always thought the saying 'dying of a broken heart' was a flight of fanciful
imagination, but as she sat there shaking into her own arms, she understood
the sentiment of the colloquial most intimately.  The way she felt, she
could as well have been dying.</p>

<p>"Please," Brooke responded letting her hand drop.  "Let me explain."</p>

<p>"I hate you with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns," Sam replied
acerbically as she tried to turn away from Brooke.  "I hope you choke on a
pomp-pomp."</p>

<p>"Please Sam," Brooke responded desperately, "just let me talk to you."  She
could see Sam still shaking and it took all of her self-control not to reach
out and try to comfort her again knowing that it would only would it make
things worse.</p>

<p>"Please?" Sam asked incredulously.  "Listen, I can only please one person a
day.  Today is not your day.  Tomorrow's not looking to good for you
either," she continued.  The tears were coming less frequently now, and she
was beginning to come back to herself enough to know that she was really,
really pissed off.  "Did you mean any of it?" Sam asked a moment later, a
note of vulnerability creeping into her voice despite her wishes.  But then
she figured that it shouldn't have surprised her.  She had never really been
able to hide her emotions from Brooke, so why should it be any different now
that it was pain she was feeling instead of love.  "Or was it just part of
some sadistic plan to fuck me for those editorials?  Literally, and
figuratively," she continued in an accusatory tone.</p>

<p>Brooke's eyes closed agonizingly as she listened to Sam's words.  "Whatever
you heard, whatever you're thinking right now…that I did, I didn't do…I
haven't done, and I absolutely positively do not want to do.  This has all
been one epic case of 'telephone' gone bad," Brooke said slowly moving a bit
closer to Sam.  "I meant everything I've said to you, I mean everything I've
said to you," Brooke continued.  "I love you…you're my heart."</p>

<p>"Harrison heard Josh talking to Nicole…about what you and he did last
night," Sam responded refusing to meet Brooke's eyes.  "If that's what you
do with your heart than I don't want it."</p>

<p>"I didn't do anything with Josh last night," Brooke stated.  "The only thing
that being with him did was testify to the fact that nobody makes me feel
the way you do.  That I love you more than I have words to express it,"
Brooke continued moving again so that she was kneeling directly in front of
Sam.  "You're the one.  You're the only one, and I need you," she finished
leaning forward and gently bringing their lips together.</p>

<p>When they separated Brooke could feel Sam's body begin to shake against hers
and could feel the wetness of Sam's tears against her cheek as they once
again began to stream down her face.  Before she could react to that however
she felt Sam begin to push against her violently as she muttered obscenities
at her, but Brooke wouldn't let go this time.  Instead she grappled with
Sam's hands until she managed to get a good hold on the girl then drew her
into the circle of her arms, where Sam continued to struggle for a moment
before relaxing into the circle of Brooke's arms crying out her heartache
onto the shoulder of Brooke's shirt.</p>
