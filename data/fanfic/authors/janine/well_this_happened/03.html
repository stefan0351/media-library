<p>Jane walked by Sam’s room, the door was open and as she passed by her eye
caught a hold of the poster on the back wall and she stopped to take a good
look at it.  The poster was of Shania Twain, she of mid-rift greatness, and
looking at the poster seriously for the first time Jane suddenly realized
that Shania wasn’t really wearing a whole lot of anything.  In fact, from
Shania’s expression she decided that  the songs-tress wasn’t so much taking
a picture as she was making love to the camera.  Jane began to realize that
this poster was promising sex; Shania was promising sex to the owner of the
poster, which in this case would be her daughter.  Jane turned away from the
poster and resumed her course down stairs with a new and intense dislike of
Shania Twain and her lyrics about feeling women.</p>

<p>As Jane entered the dining room she observed Brooke strut into the living
room, apparently just back from practice since she was till in her uniform,
where Sam was working.  Momentarily side-tracked, she watched as they
greeted each other warmly—which really wasn’t so extraordinary as it had
become their custom.  Sam put down her pencil and made some comment to
Brooke that Jane couldn’t hear but which she assumed was funny since it made
Brooke smile.  Truthfully, it wasn’t the friendly banter that interested
Jane so much as it was Sam’s reaction to Brooke.  From the moment the blonde
entered the room Sam had focused her undivided attention on her, and this is
what kept Jane watching them from her secret position, even though she felt
ashamed of herself for spying.</p>

<p>They continued to speak for a minute before Brooke plucked something out of
her bag and walked over to the stereo system.  As she did this Jane watched
Sam watching Brooke.  The brunette’s eyes drew over the blonde’s body,
positively raking over her partially clad form, a wicked sort of smile
tugging at her lips.  Jane had seen that look before on countless people’s
faces.  She had seen it in bars, and offices, and stores and anywhere where
people were.  She knew what lay behind that look, she knew what that look
was.  It was passion.</p>

<p>Jane was broken out of her revere by the sound of pulsing music—apparently
that’s what Brooke had been doing in front of the stereo while Sam ogled
her.  Concentrating on the scene in front of her once again, she saw Brooke
swaying to the beat casually, the movement almost seeming unconscious,
although Jane had no way of telling if it actually was unconscious or just
the style of the day.  Still sashaying, in a way that Jane couldn’t
characterize as asexual—even though she desperately wanted to—Brooke made
her way over to Sam, and flopped down on the couch beside her.  From that
position she slid over so that she was practically sitting in Sam’s lap and
flipped through the pages of the notebook Sam had been writing in, making
some comment that caused Sam to reach out and slap her gently, to which
Brooke merely smiled and continued with her page flipping.</p>

<p>As Jane watched she could see that Brooke was talking, but she doubted that
her daughter had anymore of an idea what the blonde was saying than she
herself did.  In the intimate position that they were in, it seemed to Jane
as if Sam was concentrating mostly on not leaning into the cheerleader.  She
could see Sam’s body sometimes rock towards Brooke as the blonde spoke, then
move away again, as if she were afraid of getting too close.</p>

<p>This was all too much for her and Jane leaned back against the wall and
closed her eyes, breathing deeply.  Things were starting to make sense to
her now, in a completely surrealistic way that was.  The girls new found
friendship, suddenly beginning to become understandable.  Jane was now
reasonably certain that Sam was subtly—maybe even unconsciously—trying to
court the blonde.  She figured that when Sam realized she was attracted to
Brooke—a fact that was now painfully clear to Jane—she must have begun to
act differently around her, the origins of her hostility having been
recognized.  This probably led them to spend quality time together, as they
did have the house all to themselves when she and Mike were away, and
unknowingly Brooke must have been going along with it, oblivious to Sam’s
real feelings for her.</p>

<p>Jane resisted to urge to bang her head against the wall knowing that it
would draw some unwanted attention to herself, and that it would stop a
brain that was barely functioning from functioning at all—and quite frankly
she needed in brain in working order.  She needed to figure out what she was
going to do about the situation, the problem was there just weren’t any
books on how to deal with situations like the one she was dealing with.  How
did one go about talking to their daughter about said daughters ogling of
her soon to be step-sister?  And, once one did manage to have the talk how
did one then make sure that said ogling stopped?  These were questions Jane
just didn’t have the answers to.  These were questions Jane was beginning to
fear she would never find the answers to.  She loved her daughter, and would
support her she just wondered to anyone who was listening why on earth Sam
had to become infatuated with Brooke of all people.  Dear, sweet, oblivious
Brooke, Jane thought to herself with a sigh.  How was she suppose to handle
this???</p>

<p>Jane continued to consider this for a few more moments then decided that she
found the entire situation terribly perplexing and that she needed to lay
down.  The Cowardly Parent, she thought to herself as she walked up the
stairs.  Too bad she wasn't in Oz.</p>

<p>It was actually a good thing that Jane left to go lay down when she did,
because if she had stayed any longer she would have seen Sam playfully start
to move her hand underneath Brooke’s skirt, and she would have seen Brooke
only have heartedly slap it before giving in totally to Sam’s roaming hands,
and this would have given her a whole new set of problems to worry about.</p>

<p>Brooke tussled her hair and pursed her lips looking into the mirror again.
Spinning around dramatically she tried several different poses, all
determined to discover whether or not her pants made her ass look big.
After that she entered into a whole new series of poses designed to
determine whether or not her hips looked big, her chest looked flat and her
claves looked bovine-ish.  Finally, once she was satisfied that everything
looked in proportion, she tussled her hair some more.</p>

<p>“How do I look?” Brooke asked finally spinning around to look at the other
occupant of the room.</p>

<p>“Gwyneth herself would be envious of your radiance tonight,” Nicole replied
with a wicked grin.  “Very nice.  How about me?” she asked spinning around
so that Brooke could get a good look at the magnificence that was her.</p>

<p>“Very Charlize Theron a la Oscars double nines, sexy and stylish.  Two
thumbs up,” Brooke responded smiling.</p>

<p>Turning back to the mirror Brooke smoothed out her shirt and looked at
herself contemplatively again.  There was something slightly narcissistic
about the amount of time she had spent in front of the mirror that night,
but she couldn’t help it.  “You think Sam’ll like it?” she asked Nicole
meditatively as she turned her head to the side.</p>

<p>“She has eyes right?” Nicole responded watching Brooke begin to primp and
preen again with a  touch of amazement.  Not for the first time she
considered the oddity that was Brooke and Sam’s relationship.  She just
didn’t understand what Brooke saw in Sam and her adventures in open-mouthed
journalism.  She wasn’t blind, she could see that Sam was attractive young
woman, after a beer or two Nicole was even fairly certain that she could do
Sam if the girl managed to not open her big, fat mouth.  But loosened
inhibitions didn’t explain Brooke and Sam.  As much chagrin as it caused
her, Nicole had to admit that Brooke seemed to be in love with Sam, and Sam
seemed to be in love with her too.  She had to acknowledge that they
genuinely liked each other as people and had a mutual respect for each
other.  The only way that she could comprehend that was to repeat to
herself,  “the universe is a strange and wonderful place”, so that’s what
she did.</p>

<p>Nicole was interrupted from her thoughts when she sensed Brooke move behind
her.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re coming,” Brooke stated simply.  She was now certain that
nothing short of death—or boarding school if their parents were to find out
what they were up to—would separate her from Sam again, and that being the
case she decided that she had to start trying to merge their worlds
together.  It was easier for her in enter Sam’s world as Carmen already
liked her, Lily was fairly indifferent to her and Harrison, well she wasn’t
really sure about him anymore but he wasn’t openly hostile.  It was going to
be a little bit tougher for Sam she was sure, which was why she had asked
Nicole to join them on their excursion.  After herself, Nicole was the big
cheese as far as the social order went and she knew that if she could get
Nicole to at least tolerate Sam’s presence the rest of the flock would fall
into order because they wouldn’t want to rock the boat.  It was the how to
get Nicole and Sam getting along part worried Brooke, but this was a start.</p>

<p>“Please, it’s lady’s night,” Nicole responded swishing around to face
Brooke.  The truth was Nicole was a firm believer that in today’s world of
broken homes and nuclear families, ones friends became their family.  That
being the case, Brooke was her family, and as such certain considerations
had to be made though she loathed to do it.  Despite her momentary lapse
into supreme bitchiness, Brooke really was the most important person in
life—sad as it was.  So, if it meant that she had to be civil towards Spam,
she would do it, grudgingly.  Plus, it really was lady’s night.</p>

<p>“We should go,” Brooke said glancing at her clock.  “We’re late.”</p>

<p>“I’m not the one that spent two hours getting dressed for someone who’s
already seen me naked,” Nicole responded swishing out the door fabulously—as
always.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” Brooke responded pouting a bit as they made their way down the
stairs.</p>

<p>Jane and Mike were in the living room and came out to greet the girls as
they descended.  They too were dressed for a night on the town.  Brooke
frowned, she hadn’t known they were going anywhere.  If she had known *they*
were going somewhere *she* wouldn’t have been going anywhere!</p>

<p>“Looking good Big Mac,” Nicole commented patting Mr. McQueen on the shoulder
and winking at him.  Brooke sighed and shook her head, it really disturbed
her when Nicole did this.  Flirting was one thing, flirting with her father
was another thing.  It was just, well gross.</p>

<p>“You look nice,” Brooke commented turning to face Jane who seemed slightly
amused by Mike’s discomfort.  She needed to distract herself, Nicole was
telling Mike how ‘strapping’ he looked, which meant that she was moments
away from hyperventilating and passing out.  This had to be avoided at all
costs.</p>

<p>“Thank you, you don’t look to shabby yourself,” Jane responded smiling.  She
was actually glad that the girls were spending some time apart.  Not that
she wasn’t one for family togetherness, she just wasn’t really big on too
much family togetherness.  And, she figured the less time they spent
together, the faster Sam’s infatuation with Brooke would pass.  This having
separate plans thing pleased her immensely.</p>

<p>“Oh, this old thing,” Brooke replied ignoring the look Nicole sent her.</p>

<p>After another moment of exchanging pleasantries Brooke began to herd Nicole
out the door.  “Have fun,” she called back to the parental units as she
headed out the door, “and don’t wait up.” With that the blondes vanished
from their world.</p>

<p>“Freedom,” Brooke purred as she slipped into the plush leather of Nicole’s
car.</p>

<p>“Even better, ‘Sirens’,” Nicole responded as she started the car up.</p>

<p>“Where did you hear about this place anyway?” Brooke asked.  Nicole merely
smiled and pulled out of the drive way.  Yeah, tonight was definitely going
to be fun.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Sam ran her hands over her shirt—not that there was much shirt to run her
hands over—and exhaled sending strands of her hair flying about her face.
Taking another look in the mirror she observed herself for a moment before
deciding that this was as good as it was going to get.  Turning around she
observed the other occupants of the room who were finishing up them selves.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” Sam said drawing their attention to her.  “Do I have my skank on
or what?”</p>

<p>“Two words: Fab Bu,” Carm responded before letting out a little whistle.</p>

<p>“Are you sure I look trashy enough?” Sam asked looking herself up and down.
“After all, we are going to a club downtown, and eleven is when the ho
parade begins.”  Truthfully, she didn’t really care about proper club
wardrobe, she just wanted to look delectable.  She wanted to look hot, dead
sexy and all that good stuff.  She wanted to drive Brooke crazy.</p>

<p>“Let me put it this way,” Lily responded running a hand threw her hair
tousling it a little.  “I’d do you,” she continued receiving grins from both
Carm and Sam.  She smirked to herself amused by the fact that they didn’t
know she was only half joking.</p>

<p>“Any glaring fashion faux paus?” Sam asked thinking that the outfit was
coordinated as far as she could tell.  “With the fashion Nazi coming with
us, I can’t be clashing,” she continued.</p>

<p>“You’re clash free, not that it matters since Brooke would probably think
you looked delicious in a burlap sack,” Carmen responded. And it was true.
The fact was that she wanted a boyfriend just like Brooke.  “That girls got
it bad for you,”  she continued enjoying the flush that came to Sam’s face.
Deciding however to give her break, she then asked “Moving on, question.
Why is Satan…I mean Nicole coming anyway?”</p>

<p>Sam smirked.  “I think Brooke wants us to bond.  Or you know at least stop
her from referring to me as Spam and me from referring to her as Smug Bitch
,” she answered shaking her head.  She had really gotten attached to calling
Nicole Smug Bitch too, it rolled of the tongue with the greatest of ease,
conveying everything Sam felt for the girl in one neat little package.  It
was as close to perfection as anything had ever come and she was going to
have to give it up.</p>

<p>“Yeah, and next week we can solve the problem of world hunger,” Lily
commented sarcastically.  Then again, she had never thought that Brooke and
Sam would learn to get along.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget overpopulation, and the destruction of the Amazon,” Carmen
added.  “We can tackle those after we all start getting along with Mary
Cherry,” she continued.  “Right Lil’ Lily?” she asked smiling her friend
winningly.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” Lily responded pouting.  “I wasn’t tryin’ to kiss her!” she
continued defensively.  “And who the hell is Joe anyway?”</p>

<p>“Well have to discuss that later,” Carmen responded taking a look out the
window.   “The cavalry has arrived…and it got a new paint job.”</p>

<p>“You, Ms. McPherson, look absolutely edible,” Brooke, purred sliding up
behind Sam as they made their way towards the entrance of the club. Sam
smiled, that’s just the look she was going for.  Yah, for her.</p>

<p>“That’s Ms. Sanford of 142 Lakeshore Blvd., and thank you,” Sam responded
flashing Brooke a grin as the blonde linked their arms together.  “And you
Ms….”</p>

<p>“Seaberg, Gretchen Seaberg.  22 years of age from West Hollywood,” Brooke
filled in helpfully though she made a face when she announced where her
donor I.D. had come from.  Of all places it had to West Hollywood.  She
couldn’t help it, as much as she tried she remained an area code snob.</p>

<p>“Are like butta,” Sam continued running her eyes over Brooke’s body
appreciatively.  Brooke smiled, that’s just the effect she had been trying
to produce.  Yah, for her.</p>

<p>“Yo, Harly and Quinn,” Nicole called drawing the girls attention to her.
“This way.”</p>

<p>Nicole then led them around the side of the building, where she then left
them for a moment to go over and talk to a bouncer that was watching the
alley entrance.  She spoke to him for a minute then walked back over to
where she had left the others standing.</p>

<p>“Welcome to paradise,” she said rejoining them and gesturing for them to
follow her through the now open door.  “The drinks are expensive, and the
bartenders are rude, but on the ho train is in full effect and everybody’s
got their hooch on, so enjoy.  And remember…you don’t know me,” she finished
as they entered the main room.</p>

<p>“Ho-Ly,” Sam breathed out  as her eyes swept across the main part of the
club.</p>

<p>“This is great,” Brooke responded looking around with the same look of awe
that Sam had on her face.  The place was unbelievable.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think places like this existed off of celluloid,” Carmen breathed
out as she took in the sight in front of her.  She didn’t know what she had
gotten herself into, but she liked it.</p>

<p>“This isn’t a Tupperware party ladies.  Mingle, mingle,” Nicole said before
sweeping out into the crowd dramatically where she was soon swallowed up.</p>

<p>The club itself reminded Sam of something out of a Greek myth, or Queer as
Folk.  In the center of the room was a fountain with water flowing into it
from an artificially created fall off to the side.  The room was covered in
gold and pink and green sea-foam.  They could as well have been in
Cleopatra’s palace, or at the very least her bathhouse.  All around them
were the sounds of pulsing techno music and gyrating scantily clad bodies.
Girls and guys, guys and guys, girls and girls, everyone was with everyone
and nobody seemed to give a good goddamn.  The place was utterly trampy, it
was tacky as hell, was a virtual eyesore of indecency.  Sam smiled she liked
it, it had character.</p>

<p>She was broken out of her revere when she felt Brooke wrap her arms around
her waist place her lips right next to her ear while whispering “dance
floor, now.  I’ve wanted to get my hands on you sine you walked out of the
house…and I do believe that I’m going to get the chance” she said surveying
the crowd with a smile of her own.</p>

<p>“Just, let it go.” Mike said softly.  Jane had been trying to tell him
something for the better part of ten minutes, and he still had no idea what
she was talking about.  He had noticed that she had seemed preoccupied for
the past week or so, but he had assumed that it had to do with the wedding
preparations.  Now he wasn’t so sure.</p>

<p>“It started with this pamphlet I found,” Jane said finally just putting it
out there.  She needed to talk to Mike about this as it would eventually
effect him too.  She had put off talking to him about it because all she had
was circumstantial evidence.  All she still had was circumstantial evidence,
but it was good circumstantial evidence she had come to realize.  She was
also, she realized, looking for a bit of encouragement.  She had meant to
talk to Sam about it, but the few times the opportunity had arisen she’d
hadn’t the heart to bring it up directly or even indirectly.</p>

<p>“Pamphlet?”</p>

<p>“In Sam’s bedroom,” Jane answered pensively.  “I swear I was just tiding up
bit…I’m not one of ‘those’ moms,” she went on.  She had had one of those
moms and she swore she wouldn’t be one of the mom/amateur detective mothers
who slipped into their children’s room after they went of to school looking
for naughty bits to hold over their heads.</p>

<p>“What was it about?” Mike asked wondering what could possibly have upset
Jane so much.  Pamphlet’s were harmless weren’t they, mostly about healthy
eating and study tips.  Surely that hadn’t agitated her. He wished he would
find a pamphlet!</p>

<p>“Same sex relationships.  A romantic guide for the other ten per cent,” Jane
related shifting her position once again, her voice lowering unconsciously.
When she realized what she’d done, she straightened up a little.  Damn,
social conditioning!</p>

<p>“Huh?” Mike questioned elegantly as always.</p>

<p>“I know,” Jane responded shaking her head helplessly.  “It was basically a
gay guide.”</p>

<p>“Sam’s?” Mike asked a moment later forcing himself to calm down.  Jane was
already worked up enough, he didn’t need to go adding to her anxiety.  He
really hadn’t expected her to say that.  Then again, he considered, it
wasn’t the type of thing that people went around expecting.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Jane answered lowering her gaze to the table top.  “It’s most
definitely Sam’s.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Mike started carefully, “she’s just curious.  Teens these days are
curious, and it’s even kind of trendy, what with Ally McBeal doing it and
Jon Voight’s daughter and all,” he continued.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke’s hand ran down Sam’s torso slowly, her fingers dancing across Sam’s
shirt then wrapping tightly around her waist as she drew them closer
together.  Sam melted into the body behind her, grinding against Brooke as
the blonde lowered her face to Sam’s necks and smiled against the slick skin
there.</p>

<p>“Come on,” Brooke whispered playfully into Sam’s ear.  “You can do it, put
your back into it,” she continued pushing her hips against Sam’s ass
erotically.</p>

<p>Sam grinned and lifted her left hand up looping it around Brooke’s neck,
tangling her fingers in the blonde hair for a moment before turning herself
around so that they were facing each other.  Brooke’s lips parted sexily, a
small gasp coming out of her mouth as she took in Sam’s wicked grin and her
hotly disheveled appearance.  Her brown locks were slightly tussled and
there was a thin sheen of sweat glistening all over her body.  She had a
flustered, yet excited energy surrounding her, and Brooke found herself
unconsciously leaning forward.  To put it as succinctly as possible, Brooke
wanted some of that.</p>

<p>Sam pulled back teasingly.  “What was that about putting my back in to it?”
she asked, dancing out of Brooke’s reach.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” the blonde responded immediately.  “I liked where your back was,
I don’t know what I was thinking,” she continued pulling a willingly Sam
back against her.</p>

<p>
“Will you look at them,” Carmen commented leaning against the bar and
shaking her head.  After being accosted by some drunken men (and one woman)
shortly after arriving she had made her way over to the bar thinking that
the experience would be much more enjoyable with a few drinks in her.
Unfortunately she found out that she was melancholy drunk, and after briefly
sampling the available male inhabitants of the club, she had resigned
herself to watching Brooke and Sam heat up the dance floor moodily.</p>

<p>“And us without our fire-hose,” Lily responded with a smirk after spotting
their friends on the dance floor.  Having just returned from doing some
networking Lily hadn’t had the opportunity to observe what the love birds
had been up to.  However, getting her first look at them she could see why
half the club had their eyes trained on them.</p>

<p>“I want that,” Carmen stated longingly a moment, watching as Sam turned to
smile lovingly at Brooke.  They were just so goddamn cute together.  Always
looking at each other with those dopey bambi eyes, smiling and each other
intimately and exchanging tender touches.  If it weren’t so genuinely
touching seeing them together it would have pissed Carmen off.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they’re already taken,” Lily commented though she admitted that
she wanted that too.  Though, she had to admit that everybody probably
wanted love, and that the kind Brooke and Sam seemed to have was of the best
variety.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean with either of them,” Carmen responded turning to glare at
Lily.</p>

<p>“Then why are you standing here talking to me?” Lily asked with an impish
grin.  “The club is your oyster.  Brooke and Sam are certainly making the
most of the experience, and let’s not even mention Nicole,” Lily went on
turning to look at the short-haired blonde, who was encircled by smarmy
dancing men, nonetheless.  “I say we find ourselves some muffins and get if
not everlasting love then at least a few free drinks.”</p>

<p>Carmen turned to look at Brooke and Sam once more.  They were now draped
around each other like expensive silk.  Carmen sighed.  “Alright…but I feel
like I’ve just been sold the cheaper chicken.”</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>“I don’t think it’s a phase,” Jane responded honestly holding his gaze. She
appreciated what he was trying to do, but she had been there and done that,
and she was fairly certain that her daughter was more than just curious, or
trendy.</p>

<p>“I won’t lie and say that I even considered this possibility, but…well, we
should be supportive.  I mean…with how things are, if is she, this is
probably hard for her,” Mike said haltingly.  He believed that his
suggestion was not only the mature thing to do but the right thing.  He had
heard that it was very confusing, and difficult for teens especially with an
alternative sexuality, and despite the tension that had existed between them
when the McPherson women first moved in, he had come to care a great deal
about Sam.  Plus, that was an teen pregnancy they wouldn’t have to worry
about.  He always liked to look at the glass as half-full.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Jane responded.  Nothing short of death would ever force her
away from her daughter, she was not going to condemn her child for who she
was, it just took a little getting used to.  As liberal as she liked to
consider herself to be, this really knocked the wind out of her.  “It’s just
been on my mind a lot since I found the pamphlet,” she continued deciding to
omit the her speculations about Sam’s feelings for Brooke until she had more
concrete evidence.  That information would just make things more complicated
and that probably wasn’t necessary since it was just a little unrequited
crush.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’ll all work out,” Mike responded squeezing Jane’s hand and
smiling reassuringly.</p>

<p>Brooke gasped as Sam slid her hands under her shirt, moaning as the brunette
began to vigorously explore the rapidly heating flesh she found there.
Brooke raised her hands up to Sam’s face holding her steady as she rained
desperate kiss after desperate kiss all over Sam’s face.  They had been
living in a world that consisted of sexual frustration, sexual frustration,
and sexual frustration, and after their outing the previous night at the
club the stewing pot had boiled over.</p>

<p>Responding to the urgency in Brooke’s movements Sam pushed forward into the
other girl causing Brooke to step back again and again until her legs bumped
against the edge of her bed sending her and Sam tumbling down onto the
pliant mattress and soon to be discarded covers.</p>

<p>“Thank the lord for annual check-ups,” Brooke mumbled as she turned them
over so that she was straddling Sam’s waist.  “With honorable mention going
to the never-ending waiting line,” she continued pulling her top over her
head, impatiently throwing it somewhere behind her.</p>

<p>Sam smiled up at her, then brought her hands up to Brooke’s face bringing
the blonde’s head down until their lips crashed together.  As Sam continued
to ravage her lips as Brooke shifted her position so that she was draped
over the brunette’s body, groaning into Sam’s mouth as the journalist
slipped her thigh between Brooke’s legs.  Pressing down on the newly offered
surface, Brooke whimpered drawing her mouth away from Sam’s, burying her
face in the other girls neck, licking and nipping at the skin she found
there as she rocked against Sam’s leg with an almost primal urgency.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s…” Sam started to say.</p>

<p>“If you say horny, I’ll kill you,” Brooke muttered into the brunettes ear.
She made ceased her actions as she began to speak, but some involuntary
shudders still ran through her body as she tried to get her breathing under
control.</p>

<p>“I was going to say eager,” Sam responded smiling.  “We’ve got hours,” she
continued in voice that was considerably huskier than usual.</p>

<p>“That’s easy for you to say.  I know what you were doing during that
marathon shower you took this morning,”  Brooke responded raising her head
and looking down at Sam with a crooked smile on her face.  As her gaze
traveled down to rest on one of Sam’s hands, one could even describe the
expression on her face as a leer, if one were so inclined.</p>

<p>Sam stared at her for a moment, opening her mouth as if to protest Brooke’s
allusion, but her lips soon curved up into a playful grin, a flush traveling
over her body, covering her skin.  “Okay, so there was that,” she responded
slyly, watching with hooded eyes as Brooke’s sky blue eyes turned a stormy
gray upon hearing the admission.  “Since you’re so interested … in my
personal grooming routine,” Sam continued teasingly, “I could give you a
demonstration” Sam offered watching Brooke carefully, reveling in her
reactions.  This statement was accompanied by the blonde sucking in a deep
breath and shuddering slightly.  Sam took this to mean that Brooke wanted
her to proceed with her tutorial and wasted no time trailing her hands up
Brooke’s thighs until they came to rest on the blonde’s waist.  From there
she pushed softly shifting their bodies so that they were both laying on
their sides, face to face.  In this position she leaned forward bringing
their lips together while simultaneously running her fingers across Brooke’s
stomach, her nails scrapping across the pale skin until she reached the
waist band of Brooke’s pants.  Sliding her body up slightly, Sam then
slipped her hand down the front of Brooke’s pants.  Brooke moaned and moved
forward into Sam’s hand wantonly.</p>

<p>And they were lost.</p>

<hr size=2 color=#669966 width=400>

<p>Sam  ran her fingers through the silky softness of Brooke’s hair.  The
blondes head was resting on her shoulder, and Sam could feel the warmth of
her breath warming the skin just above where the textbooks said her heart
lay.  “I had the strangest dream last night,” she said into the stillness of
the room.  She felt Brooke shift against, her body ‘saying continue, please,
I’m on eggshells’ as it rubbed against Sam’s.  “It was dark out, and you and
I were laying in the whitest sand you’ve ever seen.  There were tiny pink
speckles in it, but it didn’t take away from the effect, in fact they just
made it all the more amazing.  Your head was resting on my shoulder, like it
is now, and I was looking up at the stars.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound strange,” Brooke said softly.  “It sounds idyllic.”
There was a wistful quality to her voice, as if she had transported herself
into the dream as Sam spoke, and was herself laying on the tropical beach in
the brunettes arms.</p>

<p>“I was…until I saw something shoot across the sky,” Sam responded.  She
could feel Brooke tracing her finger across her stomach, lightly drawing
imaginary shapes on her skin.  It was something Sam had come to expect from
the blonde, a post-coital ritual of sorts, and it always made her heart skip
a beat.  “Soon after the that I saw another streak, and then another and
another.  Then, the sky was filled with these blazing orange streaks.  All
around us it was raining these fiery orbs.  We got scared and stood up,
where we watched those fist sized balls of fire crashing down into the
ocean.  We started looking for a place to run, to hide, but there was no
place to go.  We were on an empty island, just us, a palm tree and the sand.
  We were so scared, but when we saw that there was no place to go, we just
kind of stood there together, watching.  And soon we noticed that none of
the rocks were landing on the island, like it was a sacred place.”  Brooke
stopped her motions, now drawing her arms around Sam, hugging the brunette
to her body soothingly.  “I moved closer to you and you and you wrapped your
arms around me and the shower started to slow.  Soon after that it stopped
completely, and all around us was calm again.  We lay back down; the only
change from the beginning of the dream was the air.  It was balmy.”</p>

<p>“I could listen to you forever,” Brooke said a moment later.  “I would,
gladly.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” Sam responded looking down at the blonde head covering her
chest, her tone droll yet gentle.  “I have a lot to say.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Brooke asked, freeing one of her hands to trail down Sam’s body
slowly, coming to rest on her knee where she fingered the scar she had
discovered weeks — or was is months? — ago .  “Tell me how you go this?”</p>

<p>Sam tilted her head back, her eyes roaming the ceiling, deep in thought.
“My bike,” she said finally, having tracked down the memory and gripped it
firmly.  “I had gotten Harrison to steal his Dad’s double head screwdriver
and take the training wheels off of it.  I got on the newly bipedal
instrument immediately, and for about five seconds every thing was going off
without a hitch.  It was beautiful.  I turned around to gloat, this turned
out to be my downfall,” Sam intoned gravely.  “I lost control of the bike
and toppled over.  Sam fall down go boom.  I must have cut my knee on some
part of the bike, maybe on something on the sidewalk, I was never really
sure what did it.”</p>

<p>“I want to know the history of your body, every scar, every scratch, every
crevice from head to toe,” Brooke related when Sam finished speaking.</p>

<p>Sam turned around in the circle of Brooke’s arms.  She leaned forward and
kissed her, as she thought ‘I want to swim in your arteries and veins’.
Brooke brought her hand up to the back of Sam’s head pressing their lips
more closely together, ‘I want to inhabit your heart’ her lips seemed to
say.  She wanted to be a part of Sam’s corporal history.</p>

<p>Sam’s hand trailed up Brooke’s side, “I want to know all of you,” she
breathed out softly, her hands no longer tracing but caressing the skin
underneath them.</p>

<p>Brooke gasped, and smiled into Sam’s mouth.  “Harlot!  You want to go again,
don’t you?” she asked smirking.  In response, Sam merely yanked the rumbled
bed sheet over their heads and allowed the two most dexterous parts of her
body to do her talking for her.</p>

<p>There are certain rules that govern human existence, one of which is that
the only thing that moves faster than the speed of light in the natural
universe is the speed of gossip, which is directly proportional to the
scandalousness of the information to be gabbed about and spread around like
syphilis in a 19th century burlesque house.  The more damaging the
information, the juicer, the sexier, the better.  The place where this
phenomenon was first documented and studied were high schools, for nowhere
else on the planet-besides Hollywood-could you find a population of people
more willing and with more free time to spread and create this gossip
gleefully.  Days after Sam, Brooke and their respective associates partied
in a mightily hearty fashion at 'Sirens', anyone who was interested in this
verbal wonder would have done well to visit the hallways of Kennedy High,
for they were simply abuzz with hearsay that simply had to be passed along,
ripped apart and spread to the masses for general consumption.  Simply put
it had been a very good weekend for the rumor mill and this was a Monday
morning that was humming away.</p>

<p>Discussion Number 1:</p>

<p>"They were sooo Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon from Show Girls!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes!  I saw it with my own eyes."</p>

<p>"What the fuck were you doing there anyway man?!"</p>

<p>"Gay cousin Andrew and his partner took me.  Free beer man.  Anyway,  I
swear to god at one point Brooke had her hand up Sam's shirt!  You should
have come … I know I did later that night."</p>

<p>"That's sick man.  So it was really hot?"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 2:</p>

<p>"How trendy.  I expected more from Sam really."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 3:</p>

<p>"I heard there was so much sexual tension you wouldn't have been able to cut
threw it with a Bob Vila chainsaw."</p>

<p>"You're so full of shit."</p>

<p>"I don't think so.  I'm telling you I heard that they were positively
ancient Greek about it.  Everybody saying so."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 4:</p>

<p>"Sleepovers at that house must be like the best in the whole wide world!"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 5:</p>

<p>"I don't know if that home needs improvement, but I'd sure like to be a fly
on it's wall."</p>

<p>"You don't seriously believe that shit, do you.  Come on.  Brooke's not
gay…Sam maybe, but not Brooke.  Whoever started this should have tried to
make it at least a little bit believable.  Like the Richard Gere gerbil
story.  Now that was juicy."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 6:</p>

<p>"I'm so serious, I half expected them to break it down on the floor.  Hands
were in naughty, naughty places."</p>

<p>"And how do you know about this?  Were you there or something?"</p>

<p>"Uh…no."</p>

<p>"I can't believe you went to 'Sirens', that place is a tackily decorated
STD."</p>

<p>"Yeah…well, you're ugly."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 7:</p>

<p>"I knew it.  Yes I did.  I so knew it."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 8:</p>

<p>"Ohmygod, I saw something like this on the internet!"</p>

<p>"You do know that they're not actually sisters don't you."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 9:</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it.  You can't have that much hate without there being
something underneath."</p>

<p>"Does that mean that you're actually secretly in love with Bio Glass?"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 10:</p>

<p>"That's hot man.  It makes me something else that starts with an 'h'."
High fives are exchanged.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it.  Rob said they were grinding it down hardcore man. He
said they were like getting freaky man."</p>

<p>"We gotta start going to 'Sirens' dude."</p>

<p>"Definitely man, definitely."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 11:</p>

<p>"Is this a new trend?  I hope we don't all have to start doing it.  First
Drew Barrymore, then Angelina Jolie, now this.  I don't understand.  Does it
make you skinner?"</p>

<p>"I'm not doing it.  I don't care if it is popular.  I think it's gross!"</p>

<p>"But does it make you skinner?  I'm just not into this Xena Warrior Princess
shit, you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  Do you think it works if you just read Maxim.  I can do
that, but I'd actually read it for the articles."</p>

<p>"Did you see the one with Love, she was talking about this avocado mixture…"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 12:</p>

<p>"Gay?  Like in an Elton John way?"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 13:</p>

<p>"I told you Brooke checked me out one time in the shower that time."</p>

<p>"Why would Brooke be checking *you* out if she has Sam."</p>

<p>"Hello?  Have you not been paying attention.  She's gay ... ish, I'm gay,
maybe she was looking for some nookie."</p>

<p>"Once again I repeat, why would she be checking you out when she's got  the
sexiest, most delicious woman in the Western hemisphere at home."</p>

<p>"Oh god, not your Sam fixation again.  You sound like one of those thirteen
year olds obsessed with the stars of the WB."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 14:</p>

<p>"What were *you* doing there?"</p>

<p>"I was checking out the guys…what do you think I was doing there.  Hot
Sapphic action you moron!"</p>

<p>"Somehow I get the feeling you really were checking out the guys."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 15:</p>

<p>"Did you say there was a video? I want the video dude."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 16:</p>

<p>"Brooke?  Who cares about Brooke?  What does this mean about Josh?  Be still
my throbbing loins!"</p>

<p>"He is in the musical."</p>

<p>"I know.  Why do you think I joined?"</p>

<p>"Because you secretly want to be La Barbara."</p>

<p>"Secretly, please…"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 17:</p>

<p>"This is my greatest fantasy come true.  Finally some grrlfriends that
actually look like the ones on T.V."</p>

<p>Thus, we have the gossip monger in their natural habitat.  Fascinating.</p>

<p>Brooke moved her spoon around her cereal bowl restlessly as she stared at
the soggy flakes contemplatively.  She looked over at Sam who seemed to be
about as interested in finishing her breakfast as she herself was and
wondered if Sam was thinking about the same thing she was thinking about.
As she thought about this she noticed Sam look over at her.</p>

<p>"Have you been getting the feeling lately that you're…." Brooke started to
say.</p>

<p>"Being watched?  Yes.  I thought it was just me," Sam finished for her,
agreeing with the sentiment.  She had felt like she was constantly being
watched for a couple days, and had thought that she was being paranoid but
now she wasn't so sure.  "What about when you walk into a room.  Does
everything…" she continued.</p>

<p>"Suddenly go quiet?  Yes, totally," Brooke responded excitedly.  So she
wasn't going insane, it was just everyone else.</p>

<p>"Are you finding it as annoying as I am?" Sam asked making a face.  She was
beginning to feel like the chief suspect in a murder case.  Everyone was
eyeing her suspiciously but not saying anything directly to her, like they
expected her to pull out a knife and slice them with it or something.  It
was highly irritating.</p>

<p>"At least as much.  It's driving me insane," Brooke related tugging at her
ear.  She was used to people looking at her, but this was different.  It was
like they were judging her, or at least studying her.  She felt like one of
those single-celled organisms that they learned about in biology class.  She
decided that she didn't like being under a microscope.</p>

<p>"I'm a reporter, I should investigate," Sam said decisively.  Now that she
knew she wasn't making it up she wanted to know what was going on so that
she could make it stop.  Immediately.</p>

<p>"For once, I'm all for it," Brooke responded.  "Ouch!" the cheerleader
declared a moment later after Sam slapped her slightly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Behave," Sam instructed with a mock sternness.   "I have something for
you."</p>

<p>"Is it another punch?  Cause if it is I don't want it," Brooke replied
petulantly though she looked over at Sam expectantly.</p>

<p>Sam leaned over and kissed her on the cheek lightly.</p>

<p>"Is that okay?" Sam asked watching as Brooke's frown turned upside down.</p>

<p>"That's very okay," the blonde responded about to make an offering of her
own when Jane walked into the kitchen.</p>

<p>As Jane looked at them, she once again got the distinct impression that she
was interrupting something.  There was just something in their demeanor
when they were together that both charmed and alarmed her.  "You've still
got a few minutes," she said absently as she noticed them both start to
stand up.</p>

<p>Brooke looked down into her bowl, which now basically only continued a pile
of brown mush and turned to face Jane.  "That's okay," she responded.  And
with that she began to migrate towards the door.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam said halting her progress.  The cheerleader and her mother
both turned to look at her.  "Are you forgetting something?"  Brooke looked
at her quizzically.  Forgetting something?  Surely Sam didn't want a goodbye
kiss.  Her mother was standing right there, plus, they were going in the
same car.</p>

<p>Seeing the utterly confused look on the blonde's face, Sam held up her
school bag, then pointedly looked at Brooke's empty hands.  "Oh," Brooke
said suddenly.  "Oh," she repeated.  "I'll go get that."</p>

<p>As Brooke headed out of the room, Sam leaned against the doorway, rolled her
eyes up towards the ceiling, and boredly starting making clicking sounds
with her mouth, which eventually ran together forming a little song.  This
seemed to amuse her, because she smiled and then started to do it more
intently bobbing her head along to the beat.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Jane asked more to try and make her stop than anything
else.</p>

<p>"Just working on my music," Sam responded grinning at her mother, before
turning to stare lazily into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" Jane asked.  The question was more than a brilliant
bridge into a conversation that Jane had been wanting to have with her, she
was truly concerned.  For the past five days or so, Sam had been relatively
easy going, but before that her moods had been all over the place.  Jane now
believed she knew the cause of Sam's earlier depression, but she still
wanted to hear what her daughter had to say.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded turning to face her mother once again.  She had that
look on her face again.  That look Sam had come to dread.  It was an
inquisitive and sad look, and she had noticed her mother looking at her with
it for a while.  This look made her nervous, it wasn't a good look on Jane.
"Why?" Sam asked, a touch of suspicion clear in her voice.</p>

<p>"I'm a mother, we have to ask sometimes to feel like we're doing our jobs,"
Jane responded, hearing Brooke at the top of the stairs.  "And at the risk
of turning the conversation into a cheesy but informative social studies
video, I want you to know that if anything is bothering you … or if you're
confused about something or just want to talk I'm here for you."</p>

<p>"I know," Sam responded, avoiding her mothers eyes.  She wished that that
was true, she had always been close to her mother, and especially so after
her fathers death, but what was up with her was NOT something that you
talked to your mother about.  "I've always known," she continued with a
smile small, unable to say anything else yet wanting to comfort her mother
somewhat.</p>

<p>Jane nodded, then turned her head to watch Brooke's approach.  The blonde
held up her bag proudly with a smile.  "Remember when we were at grandma's
and the dog brought the bird it had killed to the diner table dropping it on
the floor proudly?" Sam asked as she to looked at Brooke and shook her head.
  "This reminds me of that…only the dog had something to be proud of."  Jane
turned to look at Sam, and couldn't help but laugh.</p>

<p>"What?"  Brooke asked reaching them.  The McPherson's just chuckled while
trying to act like they weren't.  "Come on what?" Brooke said, her voice
verging on whining.  Sam and Jane stopped for a moment and looked over at
her, then just when Brooke thought they were finally going to stop, they
started all over again.  Brooke could tell this was just going to be one
fabulous bitch of a day.</p>

</table>

<p>Sam sighed and adjusted her bag, she could feel her heart rate increasing
and knew that her palms were sweating, she could feel them all watching her.
  Dozens of pairs of eyes trained on her, thinking she didn't know what.  It
was like the walls themselves were watching her.  Tilting her head to the
side her gaze caught Jason Burgess's roving eyes.  Almost immediately a
dirty smile appeared on his face and he licked his lips and winked at her.
Sam immediately turned away and continued down the hall, a completely
disgusted frown marring her features.    She was still freaked and now she
felt like she needed a shower.  This was just the perfect day!  She sighed
to herself, things were getting ridiculous, it was ten times as bad as it
had been the day before, now people weren't even pretending like they
weren't talking about her, they would openly point!  She sighed again, that
was just rude.  She wondered if Brooke was getting the same thing.</p>

<p>As she entered the cafeteria there was once again a wave of people that
turned to look and look and look at her.  Catching Brooke's eyes she saw a
bewildered expression that matched her own.  Sam quickly made her way over
to where her friends were sitting and sat down, resting her arm on the table
obscuring the side of her face from any watchers.  Once safely tucked away
she noticed that Harrison was sitting with them, it was the first time since
she had told him about her and Brooke.  Of course they had talked the day
after her date with Brooke, and he had apologized for his behavior and said
that things would change, however this was the first time she had actually
noticed the change he promised.  For the first time that day Sam's mood
approached something resembling happiness.  Maybe everything would be all
right.</p>

<p>"Please tell me that you all noticed those children of the corn stares," Sam
said looking at each of them beseechingly.  In response the three other
people at the table exchanged conspirital looks with each other and shifted
in their chairs uncomfortably.  Sam got a sinking feeling upon witnessing
this.  "What's going on?" she asked somewhat apprehensively.</p>

<p>"You seriously haven't heard?" Harrison asked somewhat dubiously.  Sam was
usually on top of these things.  He was hoping that she had heard because he
didn't want to be the one to break it to her.  Honestly he wasn't sure, if
push came to shove, that he could break it to her.  Hell, he didn't even
want to break it to himself!</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded in a distressed tone.  He wasn't meeting her eyes.  This
was a bad sign.  Whatever was going on was big, it was big and it was about
her and she didn't even know what it was, she thought to herself working
herself into a big 'ol panic.  "I can't hear anything because when I
approach people cease with the talking."</p>

<p>The three of them exchanged another set of looks.</p>

<p>"Everyone's talking about you," Carm finally said, her voice only a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I figured that much out on my own," Sam responded somewhat bitchily.
Having the entire population of the school ogling her for days on end had
really started to fry her nerves.  "What are they talking about?"</p>

<p>"When I said you, I didn't mean you singularly, more like you as in you and
Brooke, you," Carmen replied in a rush, refusing to meet Sam's gaze.  "The
general consensus is that you two are doing the horizontal mamba … and that
lots of people wouldn't mind watching particular dance."</p>

<p>Sam stared at Carm for a minute, the only motion in her body being her chest
rising and falling at regular intervals.  She continued to stare like this
for quite some time before emitting a sound from the back of her throat that
could only be described as the most pitiful whimper ever in creation before
she dropped her head to the table and began whimpering some more.</p>

<p>"Look at the bright side, at least you won't be sent to an all girls school
… or boot-camp," Lily commented.  She immediately received a slap on the
shoulder from Carmen and the stink-eye from Harrison.  Sam merely moaned
again and trashed her head about.  This was officially a no good, very bad
day.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Brooke observed everyone at the table dubiously, but she paid special
attention to Mary Cherry.  They were all acting bizarrely, but Brooke was
finding Mary Cherry's repeated inquires as to whether or not she wanted to
squeeze her ripe, juicy melons particularly off-putting.  Sugar Daddy was an
interesting shade of red and despite her repeated attempts he didn't seem to
be able to look her in the eye.  Besides that Josh was shifting and shimming
in his chair like someone had poured itching powder down his pants, Popita
was wearing plaid for some reason, and there was a general feeling of
tension at the table.  She got the distinct impression that there was a
secret everyone was in on but her.</p>

<p>"Will somebody please tell me what the hell is going on here?" Brooke
requested.  Immediately Mary Cherry raised her hand in the air and began to
bounce in her seat.  Seeing that the southerner was the only volunteer -
which made her worry even more - Brooke told her to go ahead.</p>

<p>Once Brooke had given her the okay, Mary Cherry took a moment to compose
herself then launched into her oratory with an amazing verve.  "It is nah
commin knowledge," she started dramatically,  "that you Brooke McQueen,
home-coming queen and mah personal model for all that it means to be blonde
and beautiful - next ta the goddess Gywneth of course - have," she paused
here with positively theatrical timing,  "tasted of the forbidden fruit,"
she intoned gravely, before breaking out into a wide grin.  "That is ta say
that like the great Tallulah Bankhead, you have vigorously embraced the love
that dare not speak its name."  She then leaned back in her chair proudly
and folded her arms.</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, then she turned to face Nicole.  "So they
know about Sam?" she asked her friend.  The shorthaired blonde simply
nodded.  Brooke nodded back at her then said, "Well, in that case there's
only one thing to do."</p>

<p>Upon hearing this Nicole's face immediately brightened.  This was going to
be very interesting, when Brooke got her bitch on, she could go with the
best of them.  Nicole had known that the school wide discovery of her
relationship with Spam had been on Brooke's mind since she had confronted
Nicole in the Novak weeks ago, however Nicole didn't know was how the Brooke
planned on dealing with the inevitable spread of the information.  After
their heartrending meeting it had became clear to Nicole that Brooke had had
a change of heart regarding how she viewed her own relationship, now Nicole
was just intensely curious to see how this newfound pride played itself out
in a more public arena.  It other words she was waiting on eggshells to see
if Brooke was going to be all, 'we're here, we're queer', or if she was
going to employ the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy.  Only time would tell,
and that time was upon them.</p>

<p>Brooke allowed her gaze to float around the cafeteria for a moment, taking
in all of the looks that were still being sent her way.  She bit her bottom
lip and let out a soft sigh.  Catching the eye of a girl at a table off to
her right Brooke stood up.  She had had enough of this; it was time to end
things one way or another.  This was war, and in war there were always
causalities.  This girl, this unfortunate soul, was to be the first.  To bad
so sad, c'est la vie.</p>

<p>"You.  Capri pants and fuchsia scarf," she said addressing the girl.  "First
of all, no," she said looking at the outfit and making a face and shaking
her finger chastisingly.  "Secondly, and this is the important part so pay
attention now…what are you looking at?"  Capri pants and fuchsia scarf
merely blinked at Brooke in a stunned silence.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"What's going on?" Carm asked looking over at Brooke who seemed to be
harassing Kristen Sheridan.  Carm didn't think that the outfit worked
particularly well either, but that was no reason to single her out.</p>

<p>"I sense a kaboom," Sam stated pushing her chair back.  "A big kaboom," she
added returning her full attention to the scene being played out in front of
them.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>When Capri pants and fuchsia scarf neglected to reply Brooke turned her
attention to a girl off to her left who she had noticed looking at her
earlier.  "Any you.  Pleather and not quite DKNY," Brooke continued
addressing the girl with a raised eyebrow that was both  questioning and
disapproving.  "Care to share what's so interesting?"  Pleather and not
quite DKNY apparently did not care to share because she simply gaped at
Brooke like a hungry fish.  Brooke sighed this was getting her nowhere.
These people were suppose to respond to her, not just sit there like they
had the IQ of a box of hair.  She was going to have to be more direct.</p>

<p>Turning away from the gaping figure in front of her Brooke looked over to
the side towards where Sam was.  She spotted the brunette right away as she
was now standing up watching Brooke with a curious expression.  Brooke
stared at her for a second, then began to walk over to her.  She could see
Sam, and feel the whole cafeteria, watching her every move and it felt like
hours before she actually made it over to the brunette.  When she reached
Sam, she stopped just in front of her and greeted her with a small lopsided
smile.  Sam gave her a nervous smile back, and it was all Brooke could do
not to erupt into a full fledged smile.  Sam was so cute sometimes.</p>

<p>"Journey's end," Brooke whispered stepping so close to Sam that there was
hardly any space between them.</p>

<p>"And lovers meet," Sam whispered back in a barely audible voice still
watching Brooke intensely.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I'm going to do?"  Brooke asked stopping in that intimate
position, still watching Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam breathed out in a tone just as quite as Brooke's.  As she spoke
her lips twitched slightly, and Brooke knew that she was trying to contain a
smirk.  That was what she wanted to hear, what she wanted to see.  They had
to be in this together.  Then without further comment Brooke, in one grand
sweeping motion, brought her hand up to Sam's face and leaned in bringing
their lips together, in a brief but thorough kiss.</p>

<p>Up until their lips meet they had both been painfully aware of the eyes on
them, but afterwards, though they could both feel everyone gaping at them,
it wasn't quite as painful anymore, like a distant hum, an abstract
annoyance.  Brooke had kissed Sam in front of the entire cafeteria, Sam had
let her, and now there it was.</p>

<p>Separating herself from Sam, Brooke turned to survey the stupefied crowd
once more.  Silence greeted her and she knew that she was still ringmaster,
at least for the moment.  This was good.  If anyone had been up to
responding to her she didn't think she'd be able to handle it at the moment,
because despite her composed appearance she was a nervous wreck.</p>

<p>"Are you happy now?" she asked addressing anyone and everyone.  "Is that
what you wanted to see?" she continued, her voice a little tired.  She
should have been an actress.  "Can we all go back to lunch now or is there
something else I can do for you?  Anybody need a kidney?  A liver?  A stick
of juicy fruit maybe?" She paused there waiting to see if anyone would
indeed say something.  She didn't think anyone would and she was right.
"No?  Good," she stated.  "Carry on, carry on," she continued waving her
hand dismissively at them and turning back around to face Sam.</p>

<p>With that she whispered "Just sit back down, and don't look at any of them.
It'll be alright," then she herself turned around and headed back to her
table not taking her eyes off of Nicole's smirking face until she reached it
and sat down.  There she slumped imperceptivity and her hands shook faintly,
but nobody was watching her anymore.  Brooke then surveyed the table, taking
in their surprised (Josh, Sugar Daddy and Popita) and amused (Nicole and
Mary Cherry) expressions.  Her face fell, oh god what had she done?</p>

<p>As Sam sat back down, a mildly dazed look covering her features, Carm leaned
over and whispered, "that was excellent," to which Sam smiled, then started
to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, the same nervous, relieved,
terrified, amused laugh.  There is was, they all realized.  Spread out like
a two dollar buffet for everyone's consumption.  Eat up, eat up, it's on us,
Sam thought to herself,  pausing a split second after the thought ran
through her head.  When she fully realized the implications of what they had
just done she stopped, everything.  She was no longer laughing.  Oh god, she
thought, what have we done???</p>

<p>Sam breezed into the house barely seeing.  She felt light-headed, the
ground under her feet felt like it was shifting, the air around her
shimmering.  She hardly felt stable and half expected to tip over at
any given minute.  There was no sound, and everything seemed warmer
for some reason, blurry and intrusive.</p>

<p>"Why are you home so early?" Jane asked sticking her head out of
kitchen when she heard the door open.</p>

<p>"Half day," Sam heard herself say.  She was impressed, apparently
lying came naturally to her.</p>

<p>"Where's Brooke?" Jane asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know, she doesn't exactly leave me photocopies of her day
book," Sam responded in a rather biting tone.  Her head hurt, she
wanted to go lay down, she wanted to strip down and run through the
woods — if there were any woods in L.A. that was.</p>

<p>"Sam," Jane stated.  Her voice was reproachful and a little bit
hurt.  She was getting a little tired of daughters mood swings.  One
day she's says she fine, the next she's hiding in her room or biting
peoples heads off.  </p>

<p>"I'm sorry.  Okay?" Sam said.  But she didn't sound the least bit
sorry, and things were obviously not okay.  Jane didn't respond to
abrasive offering, instead simply looking at Sam inquisitively.
Seeing this look on her mothers face—a look she had become annoyingly
used to—Sam sighed and rolled her eyes muttering, "I'll be upstairs."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Sam squeezed her eyes shut, holding them tightly together as she
paced the length of floor.  She shook her head from side to side
groaning pathetically as the scene from the cafeteria played itself
in her head over and over again, mocking her, teasing her.  She
pinched the bridge of her nose and continued to pace, she was certain
that she was muttering something, but if her life depended on it she
wouldn't have been able to say what.  For the past hour the entire
world seemed to have been muted, everything had lost its luster, she
was walking in a land of murky water colours.</p>

<p>She barely registered the door opening.</p>

<p> "You're mom said you were up…" Brooke started in a hurry breezing
into the room, pausing only when she saw Sam apparently trying to
make a hole in her carpet.  "Here," she finished softly, her eyes
never leaving Sam's form as she locked the door with her right hand.</p>

<p>Almost immediately she crossed the small distance separating them.
Coming up behind Sam, she wrapped her arms around her in what she
hoped was a comforting gesture stopping, at least for the moment,
Sam's insane cycle of pacing.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Brooke said in a small voice, head dipped down.  "I
thought…I mean we had talked about…"</p>

<p>Sam shook her head.  "I just never actually thought…" she started,
trailing off, shaking her head some more.  She had thought that they
were just talking out of their asses when they had come up with this
particular contingency plan.  When coming up with an plan, particular
or not, most people talked out of their asses.</p>

<p>"Neither did I," Brooke responded truthfully.  "I…at the time it just
seemed like the thing to do," she tried to explain lamely.  The truth
was it had just seemed like the right thing, the only thing, to do at
the time.  She just couldn't explain the thought process, or
processes, that had brought her to that conclusion now.  Hindsight
was bitch and it had just up and slapped her.</p>

<p>Sam didn't respond verbally, in fact Brooke couldn't even be sure
that the brunette had heard her.  Instead, Sam merely leaned back,
snuggling into Brooke's willing arms even further.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking?"  Brooke asked finally.  She had to talk, if
for no other reason than maintaining her own sanity.  She did not
want anymore silence, silence was no longer a friend of hers.</p>

<p>"Everything.  Nothing.  I don't know.  I'm all jumbled," Sam
responded haltingly.  She stumbled over her words, raising her voice
at the end of them making them sound like questions.  It was like
they didn't quite feel right coming out of her mouth, as if they
didn't quite roll of the tongue like they used to.</p>

<p>Brooke was quiet for a moment, then said, "I shouldn't have…I don't
know what I was thinking.  Mary Cherry was all…"</p>

<p>"Don't," Sam said interrupting, her tone was laced with tender
authority.  "I'm not blaming you.  I knew, I agreed.  I'm just…
dealing now," she continued, trying to soothe Brooke whose breathing
had increased anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," Brooke admitted softly.  </p>

<p>"I don't think there's anything to do," Sam responded.  There were
certain things where you simply had to admit a loss of control.
These things were put into motion, then they had to be left alone, to
work themselves out.  There was no way they could master this now,
maybe there was never a way that they could, it was too big.</p>

<p>"What do you think is going to happen?"  Brooke asked in a small
voice.  It was a tone that Sam had rarely heard from the blonde, and
the times she had heard it she wished she hadn't.  It hurt her to
hear Brooke in pain, confused and lost.  She wanted to wash it away,
but how?</p>

<p>Sam paused, considering Brooke's question carefully although she was
already fairly certain that she had no idea.   "People are going to
react.  Either one way or another," was what she settled on,
shrugging her shoulders somewhat feebly.</p>

<p> "I think that's a safe prediction," Brooke agreed with a  small
smile.  The smile didn't remain on her face for long however; it was
soon followed by the scrunching together of eyebrows and a
sigh.  "I'm a nervous wreck," she breathed out.</p>

<p> "Is that why you came home?" Sam asked turning her head slightly so
that she could make out some of Brooke's face.</p>

<p> "Is that why you came home?" Brooke asked back, in tone teasing.</p>

<p>"I asked first," Sam responded in a like tone.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Brooke said letting out yet another sigh.  "After I went and
sat back down it was like everything went dark.  I had to concentrate
to make sure I was still breathing.  I was barely functioning, I…I
couldn't take another class or…"</p>

<p>"Walking through the hallways," Sam added.</p>

<p>"The looks.  I got enough of them on the way out," Brooke agreed
shaking her head a bit, as if trying to dislodge the memory.</p>

<p>"We're fucked.  You know this right?" Sam asked turning around in the
circle of Brooke's arms so that they were facing each other.  Brooke
smirked.</p>

<p>"We were fucked the moment I kissed three months ago.  It was just a
matter of time."  She had predicted, even back then, all those months
ago, as they lay together and she traced her hands over Sam's body
exploring her recently discovered landscape, her new alter.  She had
said it would be a complex mess of complications, and it had indeed
turned out that way.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you're overestimating the power of your charms?" Sam
responded quirking an eyebrow at Brooke playfully.  The truth was she
knew that Brooke was right, they had been lost from the very
beginning, the rest of the players in this production were only just
now catching up to them. </p>

<p>"Maybe…maybe not," Brooke responded non-committedely, but the smile
on her face told another story.

They stood there in silence together for a moment, each lost in there
own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is mom pissed?" Sam asked finally, a slightly worried expression
coming over her face as she recalled her behavior when she had first
come in the house.</p>

<p>"She's … worried," Brooke responded thoughtfully, diplomatically.
Jane had not been pleased, that had been very clear to the blonde
when she arrived at the house.</p>

<p>"She's been perpetually worried lately," Sam commented drawing away
from Brooke minutely, moving into herself a little more.  She was
drawn back to the conversation she'd had with her mother that
morning.  It was funny, it hardly seemed like it had been only a
matter of hours ago that they had spoken.  It seemed like so long
ago, a distant memory, already being glazed over in her mind.  Sam
realized that there was a reason her mother had been asking those
questions, telling her those things.  Things hadn't been right, they
had been chaotic and confused, and Jane had picked up on it.  She was
right to be concerned.</p>

<p>"We've been acting like crazy people on and off, today being an on
day," Brooke started carefully.  "She has to have sensed that
something is up," Brooke responded in a reasonable but subdued tone.
The subject of their parents was one they tried not to think about
too much, and when it was brought up it was always grudgingly,
surface conversation.  She knew that she didn't want to really think
about what it mean when they found out, and she knew that Sam felt
the same way.  It was so much easier to believe that they could keep
it to themselves until some unspecified time in the future when it
would be alright to let them know.  So much easier, but wrong.
Still, it was nice thought.</p>

<p>"They're going to find out about this too…sooner or later," Sam said
as if reading Brooke's mind.

"I know."  Brooke pouted as she said this, a small frown marring her
features.</p>

<p>"No matter how careful we are…" Sam continued, trailing off, as she
got lost in her thoughts.   "I can't help the way I look at you.
Carmen says she's amazed they haven't figured it out yet," she
continued.  "She says I have bedroom eyes."</p>

<p>Brooke was quiet for a moment, as she thought about what Sam had just
said, knowing it was perfectly true.  Carmen and Lily had learned the
truth through observing them, and so had Nicole.  It was all just an
issue of time.  They spent more time around their friends, were more
relaxed with them.  But it had been months now, and they both knew
that Jane, if not Mike too, had been watching them, and that like
their friends they would piece it together too.  "They don't want to
figure it out," Brooke responded finally.  </p>

<p>"Lucky for us," Sam replied, but she didn't sound too convinced.</p>

<p>"Lucky, yeah…but for how long?" Brooke added biting her bottom lip,
her eyes roving around the room fretfully.</p>

<p>Sam nodded her head but said nothing.  She didn't want to think about
that at the moment.  She couldn't think about it.  She only had
enough reserves to deal with one catastrophe at a time and their
parents eventual discovery of their relationship was not the one she
was going to preoccupy herself with at the moment.  It was something
that was to happen at some future date, and that meant that in the
present it could be ignored.  What couldn't be ignored were the
ramifications of their lunchtime production.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to school tomorrow," Sam said finally, breaking
the silence that had come over the room.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," Brooke responded with a little laugh before her face
turned serious again.  It was funny in a sad way.</p>

<p>"Let's walk in together?" Sam asked.  She didn't want to go, that was
true, but it was inevitable; they would have to go back sooner or
later.</p>

<p>"I'd have it no other way," Brooke responded taking Sam's hand into
hers.</p>

<p>"I love you," Sam breathed out, stepping closer to Brooke once again,
wrapping her arms around the blonde's slender waist.</p>

<p>"You're my heart," Brooke whispered back, hugging Sam closer.</p>

<p>Brooke stopped walking as she sensed Sam freeze up behind her.
Turning around she saw the brunette starring at the double doors
leading into Kennedy High with a look of terror on her face.  She
looks like I feel, Brooke thought to herself as she backtracked so
that she was standing beside Sam once again.  Looking at the doors
herself she knew exactly what Sam was thinking, and that thinking it
wasn't going to do them any good.  They had spent yesterday evening
freaking themselves out, and it would do them no good to start again.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" the blonde asked looking over at her girlfriend.
She wanted to get this over with.  What was done was done, and the
sooner they found out whether or not they had become total social
rejects, the sooner she would be able to fill out her transfer papers
and go where she had always wanted to, Beverly Hills High.  </p>

<p>Sam looked over at her and smirked.  "Does it really matter?" she
asked, her body relaxing somewhat.  </p>

<p>"I really don't think that it does," Brooke responded with a similar
expression.  They had to go in sooner or later.  "Come on, let's get
this over with," she said reaching over and taking Sam's hand into
hers.  "What's your first class?" Brooke asked trying to distract
both Sam and herself as they pushed through the doors.</p>

<p>"English," Sam responded looking around them with what she hoped were
inconspicuous glances.  She felt a bit funny, it didn't really feel
like anyone was watching them.  She had developed a kind of sixth
sense for it over the past couple of days, and she wasn't detecting
the curious stares.</p>

<p>"I'll walk you," Brooke responded decisively.  </p>

<p>"You're a good girlfriend," Sam responded smiling over at her.</p>

<p>"That's what I keep saying," Brooke replied somewhat distractedly as
she squeezed Sam's hand reassuringly.  Something was different today,
people weren't paying as much attention to them as they had been
previously.  Brooke had expected, more staring, maybe some pointed
comments, but there were only a few sideways glances and low murmurs.</p>

<p>They walked the rest of the way to Sam's classroom in relative
silence, drawing strength from each others presence while staving off
their paranoia.  When they arrived in front of the room there was
still a few minutes before the bell rang, so they joined the small
crowd of students that were lounging by the doorway waiting to be let
in.  There were about four singles hanging about and one couple off
to their left.  Everyone turned to look at them when they approached,
but then they soon turned back to whatever it was they had been doing
before the brunette and blonde arrived.</p>

<p>Sam quirked an eyebrow at Brooke, and the cheerleader shrugged with a
somewhat confused expression on her face.  This was unexpected.</p>

<p>"It's like nobody cares," Brooke whispered into Sam's ear a moment
later.  To be sure they were receiving a few veiled looks from the
people around them, and passerby's, but for the most part the looks
were just curious, nothing more.  The thought brought a smile to her
face and she could feel laughter building up inside of.  Impetuously
she leaned over and kissed Sam on the cheek, pulling back just before
the laughter that was bubbling in her stomach boiled over.  "We were
just gossip," she said softly as she began to laugh, in fact it was
really more of a giggle.  They had just been the latest gossip,
nobody really gave a good god damn, it was just something to talk
about.  Nicole's threats, her own apprehension, it didn't really mean
anything.  They were hardly the first gay couple at the school, hell
they even had an openly gay teacher.  In the larger scheme of things,
nobody really cared that she was sleeping with Sam other than as a
conversation piece, or leverage, or gossip.  There would come a time
today, or the next day, or the next day, where someone would say
something derogatory about them, that was as inevitable as death and
taxes, as the world was filled with assholes, and their relationship
was easy to attack.  But on a whole, they were just one more couple
walking down the hallway.  With everything they had put themselves
through, it was looking as if nobody really gave a flying fuck.  </p>

<p>Brooke leaned against the wall as she laughed.  That was hilarious,
in fact is was so funny that it almost made her want to cry.   </p>

<p>Brooke led Nicole, Popita and Mary Cherry into the backyard of the
house.  Jane had suggested some alterations to their uniforms that
the Glamazons had unanimously decided absolutely had to be done, so
the four of them were to be Mrs. McPherson's guinea pigs.   When they
arrived, Jane was talking with her dad on the porch so Brooke decided
to show them the new reflecting pond they had just had landscaped
into the backyard.  It was absolutely killer, and they were the first
people on the street to have one.  Nicole was going to flip.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>When Sam finished with the bird feeder her eyes immediately began to
scan for the yard for her girlfriend.  Spotting Brooke she began to
make her way over, her eyes drifting uncomfortably to the deck where
her mom and Mr. McQueen had been lounging, her brows drawing together
in confusion as she noticed that Mary Cherry seemed to be talking to
them.  Stopping beside Brooke she placed her hand on her shoulder to
draw her attention. </p>

<p>"Why is Mary Cherry talking to mom and your dad?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked.  "She's right," however as she said this Brooke
looked around her immediate vicinity and noticed that Mary Cherry was
indeed not with the four other girls.  Turning her head towards the
deck her eyes widened.  "Oh god no," she gasped spotting Mary Cherry
gesturing wildly to the parental units.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Mr. McQueen, almost Mrs. McQueen," Mary Cherry began.  "I would jus'
like ta take this opportunity ta say that I'm very impressed with
your liberal open-mindedness.  I think that it's absolutely fabulous
that your'll so accepting of Brookie and Sam's so highly
controversial union.  Back home if the aged P's wah eva' to find out
that their daughters were engaged in sexual congress right under
their very roof, heads would rollll!  People like you are the reason
why I love L.A. so very, very much!  Thank you," Mary Cherry
concluded grinning.  </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As the last syllable left Brooke's mouth, Mary Cherry began walk away
from the parental units and towards the four girls.  Likewise, Mike
and Jane turned their heads so that they were facing the girls, and
even from the distance they were at Brooke and Sam could detect the
looks of surprise and confusion covering their faces.  They weren't
so much looking at them as they were gaping.  Sam felt her hand drop
from Brooke's shoulder although she wasn't conscious of doing it;
everyone in the yard had seemed to freeze in position, still like
stone as the implications of what had just occurred came to them,
ramming into a certain brunette and blonde like a runaway freight
train.</p>

<p>Then almost as soon as it happened, it ended with older ones turning
away and walking inside the house leaving the yard to the teenagers.</p>

Mike turned around and closed the screen door leading into the house,
his movements very slow and very precise.  He stayed facing the door
for a moment, taking a deep breath then turned around to face his
fiancé who was standing just across from him with her hands folded
across her chest her eyes peering behind him and out the glass of the
door. Crossing the few steps between them Mike placed his hand on the
small of her back leading her into the study, away from prying eyes.</p>

<p>"She said…" Mike began trailing off.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jane agreed nodding her head, although she wasn't quite
certain why.</p>

<p>"Brooke's not…" he replied once again leaving the sentence hanging.</p>

<p>"I didn't think Sam was, but…," Jane responded contemplatively.</p>

<p>"Not that there's anything wrong with that," they both injected a
moment later, before nodding at each other in acknowledgement of the
others statement.  </p>

<p>"A golfing buddy of mine is, you know," Mike said finally.</p>

<p>"I have a sorority sister who is too," Jane added.  She wasn't quite
sure if it was a relevant piece of information, and if it was why it
was, but it seemed like a good thing to add at the time, so that's
what she did.</p>

<p>Mike nodded along but didn't say anything for a moment. </p>

<p>"Wouldn't we have known?" he asked finally.  He sounded more hopeful
than convinced however.</p>

<p>"Maybe, I mean…maybe," Jane responded.</p>

<p>"Nobody guessed about Liberace," Mike observed thoughtfully.  </p>

<p>"And Lily Tomlin.  That one threw me," Jane added, shifting her
weight.  "Then again I never would have guessed about Ellen," she
continued.</p>

<p>"There would have been signs," Mike stated, but really it sounded
more like a question.  He knew that with Sam, Jane had found the
pamphlet but Brooke?  Where were the signs?  The preparation?  The
heart attack prevention measures?</p>

<p>"Ellen never really talked about her personal life in her routines,"
Jane responded.  "Hers was always more situational comedy.  Like that
bit about why people put arrows at the bottom of pages, like they
would forget to check the other side or something."</p>

<p>"I meant about Brooke," Mike injected scowling at her.</p>

<p>"Oh.  Sorry," Jane responded shaking her head a little bit.  She felt
lightheaded, like on a hot day in Fresno.  </p>

<p>"Wait.  Brooke's got a copy of that movie `Bound'," Mike blurted out.
His mind automatically drifting to consider the uncanny physical
resemblance between Sam and Gina Gershon.  He wondered if that had
done it.</p>

<p>"Sam was fascinated with the book `The Edible Woman' until she found
out what it was actually about," Jane related in a similar tone.</p>

<p>"Brooke has every Madonna album ever produced," Mike said running a
hand through his hair and tugging at it gently.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Jane muttered under her breath.  She was finally able begin
comprehending what Mary Cherry had told them, what seemed like eons
ago, and she really wished she hadn't been.</p>

<p>"But…Brooke's a cheerleader!" Mike exclaimed looking over a Jane
hopefully.  Brooke couldn't be…with Sam, because Brooke wasn't gay,
he reasoned to himself.  </p>

<p>"Think about how they've been acting since we got back," Jane
continued, not even aware that he had spoken, so busy was she trying
to put the clues together.  "Oh god, think about how we found they
when we got back!  And when I went to return Brooke's book, and…I
need to sit down," she finished plopping into a nearby chair.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" Mike asked with a dazed look on his face
as he leaned against the desk wearily.</p>

<p>"We have to talk to them.  If something is going on then we need to
know what, and if nothing going on then we need to know that too,"
Jane replied thoughtfully.  "But for the moment, the name Jack
Daniel's comes to mind."  She paused.  "At least for you."</p>

<p>As soon as Mary Cherry approached their location Sam lunged at her,
grabbing her shirt.  "Mary Cherry, what did you say to them!?!" the
brunette asked shaking the southerner slightly.</p>

<p>"Oh mah gawd," Mary Cherry exclaimed in a panicky voice.  "She's
rumplin' my Versace!"</p>

<p>"Come on Sam," Brooke said softly, placing a reassuring, but
restraining hand on Sam's shoulder, rubbing it gently trying to sooth
the irate brunette as she released Mary Cherry from her clutches.  It
was the mature thing to do, Brooke kept telling herself.  Losing
their temper wasn't going to do anybody any good.  Still, a little
part of her wanted to have at Mary Cherry just like Sam had
done.  "We have to handle this responsibly," Brooke went on once Sam
had let go and was engaged in taking some deep, calming
breaths.  "Mary Cherry," Brooke continued in a tone that oozed of
barely restrained hostility, "you're going to me exactly what you
said to our parents," Brooke went on, but she could feel herself
slipping, and when Mary Cherry grinned that insane grin at her she
lost it.  "You're going to tell me or else I'll gas and burn your new
Donna Karen," she exclaimed reaching for the girl herself only to be
restrained by Sam.</p>

<p>"Where's the love Brookie?" Mary Cherry asked somewhat petulantly.
However, as she observed the tender embrace that Brooke had settled
into in Sam's arms after the brunette had restrained the blonde from
trying to maim her, Mary Cherry felt better.  "Oh yeah," she drawled
knowingly, as she grinned and ogled them suggestively. </p>

<p>This time both of them jumped at her and the only way Mary Cherry was
able to save herself was by hiding behind Popita, using her as a type
of human shield.</p>

<p>"I merely congratulated the Aged P's on accepting you controversial
union with such grace and dignity," Mary Cherry revealed suddenly
concerned for her very safety.  And she thought that love was suppose
to make the heart grow fonder, it had just made those two homicidal.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence following Mary Cherry's declaration.
Then Sam turned to face Brooke, who was staring at the southerner in
a wide eyed, open-mouthed stupor, and grabbed onto her shoulders
shaking her to get her attention.</p>

<p>"They know.  We're dead.  They're gonna murder us.  We'll probably
learn where Jimmy Hoffa is.  We're dead," Sam rambled off.</p>

<p>"This is lovely day, but not lovely enough to die.  How far is it to
Mexico?" Brooke asked no one in particular.  Were her ears bleeding?
She felt like her ears were bleeding.  </p>

<p>"Oh no," Sam exclaimed drawing Brooke attention to her in the same
way people's attention is drawn to car crashes.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked softly, quite afraid of what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"Look, they're going for the liquor cabinet," Sam said pointing to
the window.</p>

<p>"We're going down," Brooke stated her eyes shutting as she sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>"Isn't that what got ya in trouble in the first place?" Mary Cherry
asked smiling from behind Popita, cowering slightly as Sam lounged at
her again.  Nicole merely watched the festivities with highly amused
smile on her face.  You couldn't buy this sort of entertainment.  </p>

<p>"Run Poppy run," Mary Cherry exclaimed as Sam clawed at her.  "We are
no longer welcome at this bath house of fun!" she continued grabbing
Popita by the hand and dragging her towards the nearest exit.</p>
