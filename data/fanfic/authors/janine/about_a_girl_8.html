<!-- About a Girl \ Part 8 -->

<p><u><i>Karen's House - A Week Later</i></u></p>

<p>"You didn't have to do this," Karen said stepping back out of Judy's  way as her friend moved across the kitchen to reach for the plates.   After a conversation they'd had earlier that week, Judy had declared  that she was going to come over and cook some real food, after all of  the take-out they'd been living off of since Karen returned home.   Karen had protested at first, but eventually Judy's promises of food  that didn't come out of anything Styrofoam won her over.</p>

<p>"I know," Judy replied turning around to face her with a little  smile.  "I wanted to.  Now gracefully accept, and call your brats for  dinner," she continued moving into the dining room to set the table.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Karen said her voice teasing as she headed for the  stairs.  "Really," she continued more seriously.</p>

<p>"You're very welcome," Judy replied, and then turned back to her task  as Karen set off up the stairs.  It was still difficult for her to  move around, and just moving around the house tired her out to a  degree that she never would have imagined possible before, but she  was getting better.  And she was able to walk with only a cane now,  so she had gotten back some of that independence she had sorely  missed during the apex of her injury.</p>

<p>"Dinner ready?" Eli asked popping his head out of his door, his nose  twitching as the smells from downstairs wafted up to him.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Karen responded.  "Is Jessie in her room?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, she got a phone call twenty-minutes so she's probably still  squealing away," he answered pushing out of his room and heading for  the stairs.  "You'll be okay?" he asked wondering if she'd need his  help down.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Karen nodded smiling at him.  "Go ahead," and with that he  disappeared down the stairs.</p>

<p>"No, you shut up," Jessie said laughing into the receiver.  "No.   No.  No you shut up," she repeated again giggling as her mother  approached her partially open door.  Knowing that she probably  shouldn't but unable to help herself, Karen propped herself up  against the wall outside Jessie's room, listening to the happy sounds  that drifted into the hallway, a smile working it's way across her  face at hearing her daughter so obviously happy.</p>

<p>"You do more," Jessie went on, her voice teasing.  "Hmmm," she  continued thoughtfully.  "Maybe.  I said maybe," she went on drawing  out the last word wickedly.  Karen placed her hand over her mouth,  overcome by the sheer preciousness of the scene.  She remembered what  it was like to be in High School, and how she had had similar  conversations with boys from school just like the one Jessie was  having now.  "Hey," she heard Jessie exclaim, jarring her back to the  present.  "Yeah, I guess I do," she continued oblivious to her  mother's presence.</p>

<p>Beginning to fell bad about her eavesdropping, Karen silently  repositioned herself to make it seem as if she was just coming down  the hall, and called out Jessie's name, pushing her door open as she  did.</p>

<p>Jessie flipped over looking at her doorway to see her mother standing  there.  "I gotta go," Jessie said.  "Dinner.  Judy.  Yeah.  Yeah.   Yeah.  Stop it," she said, pausing every few second's apparently  answering questions from the person on the other end.  "I gotta go.   I mean it, she's standing right here.  Okay.  Bye," Jessie finished  clicking off the phone and standing up.  "I'll be right down, I just  gotta wash my hands," she said looking over her mother.</p>

<p>"Okay, everything's set up so just come down when you're done," Karen  responded backing out of the doorway to let her by.  Then smiling as  Jessie bounded down the hallway she made her way down the stairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She was still on the phone?" Judy asked raising an eyebrow as Karen  took her seat.  "Who was she talking to?"</p>

<p>"Tad," Karen responded smiling as she reached for her silverware.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Eli mumbled derisively around a mouth full of  food.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Karen asked looking up at him curiously.  She had  been certain that with the way Jessie had been acting it had to have  been Tad she was taking to.  "Is she seeing someone else?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, but that's not what I meant," Eli replied looking  up for a second before turning back to food.  "It was a girl on the  other end.  Probably Katie," he continued.  "All I ever hear or see  anymore is the two of them laughing and flitting around," he went on  rolling his eyes as he reached for his drink.  "Is there anything  more annoying than teenage girls?"</p>

<p>"You didn't seem to mind them two years ago," Judy, commented  grinning at Eli, who had the good graces to nod, conceding her point.</p>

<p>"She's been over there a lot too?" Karen asked looking over at Eli,  her mind still wrestling with her earlier interpretation of Jessie's  tone and the information that she had been talking to Katie, not Tad.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Eli muttered as he chewed.  "I swear to god, Dad's going to  have to convert the storage closet into a room for her or something,  she's over there more than I am," he continued.</p>

<p>"She's so cool though," Judy said piping up.  "I was talking to her  about the new Victoria's Secret line, and she was so right about like  everything.  I went back, and pg. 56 really was probably the most  unappealing thing I'd ever seen.  The convent page," Judy continued  chuckling to herself as she thought about it.</p>

<p>"Yeah, fabulous," Karen replied, forcing a smile onto her face.  She  was distracted, there was something nagging at her, scratching at the  back of her mind trying to dig through, but she couldn't put her  finger on it.  She just knew that there was something that she should  be getting but that just kept eluding her.  However, before she  ponder the situation anymore Jessie came tumbling down the stairs  throwing herself into the free seat, drawing Karen's attention  outwards once more.</p>
