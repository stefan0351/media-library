<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 6 -->

<p>"Out!  Out!  Get out.  Do I look like a care?  Don't ever wear those shoes
in my presence again, thank you.  Out!  Do I even need to say it?  Goodbye,"
Nicole said as she herded all the occupants of the washroom out of it in
record time.</p>

<p>Following the last of the flock to the door, Nicole slammed it shut knocking
the last of the girls out and locked the door.</p>

<p>"Much better," she exclaimed twirling around dramatically to face Brooke.</p>

<p>"What going on Nic?" Brooke asked wearily.  She had seen this look on
Nicole's face before and wasn't really impressed with the end results when
she had.</p>

<p>"It occurs to me that we really haven't had the time to just down and talk
lately," Nicole started, stopping momentarily to observe her reflection in
the mirror before turning to face Brooke once again.  "And I really think
that we need to talk.  Wait, scratch that...YOU need to talk."</p>

<p>"You're gonna have to be more specific," Brooke responded folding her arms
across her chest defensively.</p>

<p>"Okay," Nicole said her posture tightening and her eyes narrowing a bit.
"When were you going to tell me about you and Lois Lane?"</p>

<p>"Lois Lane?" Brooke asking feigning ignorance even though she knew exactly
who Nicole was talking about.</p>

<p>"Don't fuck with me Brookie, you know who I'm talking about.  Spam, now
spill," Nicole responded moving closer to Brooke, invading her personal
space.</p>

<p>"What about Sam?" Brooke asked with a slight sigh.  She should have seen
this coming.</p>

<p>"Just tell me one thing, have you gotten in her pants yet?" Nicole asked
circling around Brooke like a shark around injured prey.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" Brooke asked keeping her gaze forward.  She
had tried to follow Nicole's movements for a while but the way the girl was
moving was just making her dizzy.  She had to stay calm here, focused.  She
couldn't really tell where Nicole was on this and she wanted to try and feel
her out a bit more before admitting anything.  Nicole was a force of nature,
and like most natural occurrences she could and gladly would leave
devastation in her path.  Brooke had seen it before and she knew she would
see it again, and she was absolutely certain that she didn't want to be one
of the objects of Nicole's ferocity.</p>

<p>"I'll admit, it took me longer than it should have," Nicole started slowly,
coming to a stop in front of Brooke.  "But it did come to me.  I've
noticed...how you've changed...and I know why," she practically purred.  "I've
seen you looking at her...the only other time I've seen such raw lust
displayed so openly on a human face was during the Sax's 5th Avenue labour
day sale in '95," she continued, now so close to Brooke they were almost
touching.  "You could as well just hump her leg...it's obvious she's got your
digits and that you've got hers," she concluded backing up a bit to examine
her handy work.</p>

<p>"Nic..." Brooke started, but she was cut off by the shorter blonde's raised
hand.</p>

<p>"I know Brookie...just give it up," Nicole said lowering her hand.</p>

<p>Brooke lowered her eyes from Nicole's and ran a hand through her hair
anxiously.  When she looked back up the answer was written all over her face
and Nicole turned away from her.  Brooke sighed and rubbed at her eyes,
waiting patiently for her friends reaction to her admission.</p>

<p>"You've made things very difficult," Nicole said slowly and softly as she
returned her gaze to Brooke's.  "Do you know what this could mean?" she
asked in a more dangerous tone.</p>

<p>"Of course I know what it could mean," Brooke shot back at her.  "Do you
think I haven't thought about this, that I haven't lost sleep over this...I
know Nic...it's a cataclysmic inconvenience," Brooke went on shaking her head.
  "But I..."</p>

<p>"Couldn't keep your pants on?" Nicole suggested.  Brooke looked over at her
sharply.  Nicole found the reaction very intriguing.  "If you were into
girls we could have found you someone who hasn't made our lives a living
hell and who isn't soon going to be your SISTER!" she went on with
increasing verve.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'found me someone'?" Brooke asked distracted from the
bigger picture momentarily.</p>

<p>"I know people, and you're good looking," Nicole responded absently.  "Some
people actually decide they're not going to fuck everyone they know up the
ass for a roll in the hay," she continued.</p>

<p>"It's not like that," Brooke replied.  "And as hard as it might be for you
to believe, this isn't about you."</p>

<p>"But it is," Nicole said looking at Brooke intently.  "Because whether or
not we want it, I'm your goddamn Rizzo."  There was a hostility in her voice
when she said this that Brooke couldn't help but pick up on.  She opened her
mouth as if she was going to say something, but then quickly shut it again.
She found herself quite at a loss for words.  This conversation wasn't going
how she would have wished it, but it wasn't going as badly as it could have.
  She was relatively certain by this point that Nicole was going to back her
up, all she had to do was not piss the girl off anymore and ride out the
wave.</p>

<p>"Are you in love with her?" Nicole asked finally, breaking the silence
brought on by Brooke's non-answer.  Brooke merely caught her eye in response
then looked away.  "That's just fan-freaking-tastic," Nicole muttered to
herself.  Brooke said nothing.  "This can't get out," Nicole said coming to
stand in front of Brooke.</p>

<p>"I don't want this get out," Brooke responded honestly.  "I don't to be the
real life version of 'But I'm a cheerleader'...I...I just want to be with her,"
she finished softly.  This answer seemed to please Nicole, at least on the
surface.</p>

<p>"That's good," Nicole responded, her voice somewhat distant.  "If you can
control yourself enough not to look at her with those dopey 'fuck-me-eyes'
anymore, things might just work out," and with that she turned away from
Brooke and headed for the door, unlocking and walking out with a smile
before the other girl had a chance to respond or see her expression.</p>
