<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 37 -->

<p>As soon as Mary Cherry approached their location Sam lunged at her,
grabbing her shirt.  "Mary Cherry, what did you say to them!?!" the
brunette asked shaking the southerner slightly.</p>

<p>"Oh mah gawd," Mary Cherry exclaimed in a panicky voice.  "She's
rumplin' my Versace!"</p>

<p>"Come on Sam," Brooke said softly, placing a reassuring, but
restraining hand on Sam's shoulder, rubbing it gently trying to sooth
the irate brunette as she released Mary Cherry from her clutches.  It
was the mature thing to do, Brooke kept telling herself.  Losing
their temper wasn't going to do anybody any good.  Still, a little
part of her wanted to have at Mary Cherry just like Sam had
done.  "We have to handle this responsibly," Brooke went on once Sam
had let go and was engaged in taking some deep, calming
breaths.  "Mary Cherry," Brooke continued in a tone that oozed of
barely restrained hostility, "you're going to me exactly what you
said to our parents," Brooke went on, but she could feel herself
slipping, and when Mary Cherry grinned that insane grin at her she
lost it.  "You're going to tell me or else I'll gas and burn your new
Donna Karen," she exclaimed reaching for the girl herself only to be
restrained by Sam.</p>

<p>"Where's the love Brookie?" Mary Cherry asked somewhat petulantly.
However, as she observed the tender embrace that Brooke had settled
into in Sam's arms after the brunette had restrained the blonde from
trying to maim her, Mary Cherry felt better.  "Oh yeah," she drawled
knowingly, as she grinned and ogled them suggestively. </p>

<p>This time both of them jumped at her and the only way Mary Cherry was
able to save herself was by hiding behind Popita, using her as a type
of human shield.</p>

<p>"I merely congratulated the Aged P's on accepting you controversial
union with such grace and dignity," Mary Cherry revealed suddenly
concerned for her very safety.  And she thought that love was suppose
to make the heart grow fonder, it had just made those two homicidal.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence following Mary Cherry's declaration.
Then Sam turned to face Brooke, who was staring at the southerner in
a wide eyed, open-mouthed stupor, and grabbed onto her shoulders
shaking her to get her attention.</p>

<p>"They know.  We're dead.  They're gonna murder us.  We'll probably
learn where Jimmy Hoffa is.  We're dead," Sam rambled off.</p>

<p>"This is lovely day, but not lovely enough to die.  How far is it to
Mexico?" Brooke asked no one in particular.  Were her ears bleeding?
She felt like her ears were bleeding.  </p>

<p>"Oh no," Sam exclaimed drawing Brooke attention to her in the same
way people's attention is drawn to car crashes.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked softly, quite afraid of what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"Look, they're going for the liquor cabinet," Sam said pointing to
the window.</p>

<p>"We're going down," Brooke stated her eyes shutting as she sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>"Isn't that what got ya in trouble in the first place?" Mary Cherry
asked smiling from behind Popita, cowering slightly as Sam lounged at
her again.  Nicole merely watched the festivities with highly amused
smile on her face.  You couldn't buy this sort of entertainment.  </p>

<p>"Run Poppy run," Mary Cherry exclaimed as Sam clawed at her.  "We are
no longer welcome at this bath house of fun!" she continued grabbing
Popita by the hand and dragging her towards the nearest exit.</p>
