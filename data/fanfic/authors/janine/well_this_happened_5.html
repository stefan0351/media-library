<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 5 -->

<p>Nicole Julian leaned against one of the lockers opposite the Novak idly
looking at her perfectly coiffed nails in between scanning the hallways.
She knew that most people thought of her as cold, unfeeling, and
devastatingly beautiful, and too be sure she was all of those things, but
too many people confused her indifference to her surroundings with an
inability to understand them.  This was a very big mistake, one those
unfortunates usually paid for dearly.  Lately, this underrated power of
observation that Nicole was gifted with had been turned towards her best
friend, Brooke.</p>

<p>She had first noticed a change in Brooke shortly after her father and the
McPherson woman had gone away on vacation, and after the night Brooke had
told her Sam was cooking dinner for her.  For the few days following that
night, Brooke had been very tense, and that apprehension increased
considerably whenever Sam entered a room.  But unease wasn't the only thing
Nicole had noticed during those days, almost more interesting had been the
fact that even though Brooke was quietly hostile-as is her way-towards Sam,
she had been oddly captivated by her, staring almost constantly at her and
speculating out loud what the brunette could have been thinking about.  This
had originally drawn Nicole's attention because she could have cared less
what was going through Spam's infantile little mind, but then maintained her
interest because she was certain Brooke shouldn't have given a flying fuck
what Sam was thinking either and she wanted to know why Brooke had suddenly
taken an interest in the goings on of that particular cranium.</p>

<p>And then, after days of mounting hostility and just when the friction
between the two of them seemed to be reaching its pinnacle, nothing
happened.  At least not of the explosive, earth-shattering variety that
Nicole was rather fond of.  The very next day, not only were things no
longer stressed between the two, but they seemed to be friendly terms.
There was a politeness to their interactions after that, and, Nicole had
noticed with some confusion, a kind of coyness on Brooke's part.  As for
Sam, gone was the perpetually furrowed brow whenever she came into contact
with them, and gone were her constant pissing and moaning about them and her
even more exasperating silent accusations.  There seemed to have been a kind
of peace formed between the two of  them, and Nicole didn't understand or
like it.</p>

<p>And then, came the cancelled gatherings.  Almost every night of the
subsequent week Brooke had cancelled the plans she had previously made with
them.  She had sighted everything from homework, to exhaustion, but Nicole
knew those weren't the real reasons she was canceling.  She had always had
homework and had always been busy, but had never cancelled on them.  To be
doing it so frequently then, was highly suspicious.  She had no concrete
proof, of course, but she was certain that it wasn't a whatever that causing
Brooke to cancel, but a someone and she was certain that someone was Sam.</p>

<p>Her 'it has to be Sam' theory, was momentarily thrown when Brooke had
suddenly shown up at her house one night sporting a hicky and rumpled
clothing she was unaware she was sporting. Nicole had then been forced to
modify her theory slightly coming to the conclusion that Brooke had begun to
secretly date someone-of course she could have merely been fucking someone,
but Nicole knew that wasn't Brook's style-and Sam must know about it which
was why they had changed from enemies to 'frienemies'.  Brooke was just
protecting her interests.</p>

<p>That theory had suited Nicole rather well until the last week or so when she
began to notice something else.  Brooke and Sam weren't simply looking at
each other they were *looking* at each other.  Nicole noticed Brooke's eyes
follow Sam's figure down the hallway much longer than was necessary on many
occasions, not merely tracking her but raking her eyes over her with an
expression-momentary as it always was-of hunger. In addition she noticed Sam
gazing at Brooke across from the other side of rooms-it didn't really matter
which room as long as they were in it together-with a look that Nicole was
forced to describe as 'longing'.</p>

<p>This new information caused another revamping of her theory, or more
accurately a combining of her previous ones.  She hadn't really been wrong
those other times, she just hadn't seen the big picture-which she was
confident she now did.  Brooke's sudden change did have to do with Sam.
Brooke was seeing somebody new and Sam did know about it, because Sam was
the person Brooke was seeing.  This was now known to her, and it was time
for Brooke to explain herself.</p>

<p>Buffing her nails one last time Nicole waited for Brooke to reach her before
pushing off of the locker and grabbing the other girls hand pulling her
towards the Novak.</p>
