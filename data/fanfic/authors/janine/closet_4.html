<!-- The Closet \ Part Four -->

<p>Brooke turned her head to look at Sam just as the brunette turned to
face her.  Their eyes locked and narrowed.  They had entered their
room only moments before engaging in this almost primal staring
contest.  Sam licked her lips.  Brooke noticed the movement and
blinked.  This was the opportunity that Sam had been looking for.
She smiled to herself and thought `sucker!'  She broke out into a
sprint.  Brooke noticed the movement and started after her, but she
was too slow.  Sam jumped into the air launching herself forward,
landing on the mattress softly, skidding across it for a second
before coming to complete stop.  She raised herself into a sitting
and then a standing position where she turned to face Brooke arms
raised high in triumph.</p>

<p>"I have picked my bed," Sam declared smiling.  It was the one on the
right side of the room, the one she knew Brooke wanted.  Both of them
had this thing with having whatever was on the right side, and she
had won this battle.  </p>

<p>"Whatever," Brooke mumbled staring at Sam as if she were trying to
cast a spell that would inflict the ten plagues of Egypt plus a
clashing wardrobe upon the brunette.  After that voodoo moment Brooke
then bent down and picked up her suitcase adding `stupid jackass'
under her breath as she carried it over to the other bed.</p>

<p>Sam sat and down on the bed and crossed her legs watching as Brooke
resentfully heave her suitcase onto the bed, still muttering under
her breath.</p>

<p>"Don't be bitter," Sam commented as she luxuriated across her bed,
sighing contently, "it'll give you wrinkles."</p>

<p>Brooke frowned, turning her head slightly so that she could see
Sam.  "I'd ask if you're always this annoying, but I'm already
painfully aware of the answer to that question," Brooke responded,
pushing to suitcase to the other side of the bed and lying down
wearily.</p>

<p>"Hey, I didn't ask to be roomed with you either Merry Sunshine," Sam
replied getting up off of the bed and moving to retrieve her own
suitcase, which had been unceremoniously dumped just inside the
doorway.  Hauling the luggage up onto her bed, Sam looked over at
Brooke just in time to see the blonde smirk and let out a short,
derisive, wisp of laughter before then moodily turning her attention
to the ceiling.  Sam observed her for a second, think that she looked
rather peaceful despite the situation, the way the light was shining
on her seemed to light her hair up making it look like she was
surrounded by a golden halo, and the angle that she had her head
titled at gave her a rather reflective appearance, like one of those
ancient Greek statues from the classical period where the subject
always looked like the were contemplating some elusive truth.</p>

<p>Sam turned away and began to fiddle with her suitcase, trying to open
it.  She had things to prepare for tomorrow before Glass came to get
them for dinner.  There were other things to think about besides
Brooke.  She was on a mission after all.</p>

<p>"Dammit," Sam exclaimed a moment later.  The lock to her suitcase
seemed to be stuck.  She did not need this.  In fact, she was so busy
trying to mentally combust the case that she didn't notice Brooke
approach her until the blonde spoke.</p>

<p>"Here," Brooke softly said coming to stop beside Sam and reaching
over for the case.  "Mine does this all the time," she continued
turning her head to look at Sam for a moment before returning her
gaze to the suitcase.  Sam felt herself gulp, and prayed to God that
it wasn't audible.  Having Brooke this close to her, speaking to her
in a soft sexy whisper was doing things to her that was only suppose
to happen when she was alone in her room at night.  </p>

<p>"All you have to do is very gently," and with that Brooke raised her
arm high up into the air and slammed it down onto the top of the
leather suitcase with all of her strength.  Sam gaped at her, so
surprised by Brooke's assault of her suitcase that she didn't resist
when the blonde then reached for the key which was loosely held in
her hand, and removed it using it to open the case.</p>

<p>"Thanks?" Sam responded still mildly stunned, but glad that she was
no longer in the Brooke induced fog that had been hanging over her
moments before.  Brooke took a step away from Sam, looking over at
her, a small smile gracing her features before she looked away and
headed back over to her side of the room.  "I meant that," Sam added
a moment later.</p>

<p>"Your welcome," Brooke replied as she lay back down and closed her
eyes while taking in a deep breath.  Sam smelt like lavender and she
could still faintly detect the scent hovering about her.  She liked
it, not that she would ever in life tell Sam that.  </p>

<p>She stayed like that for a moment longer then  opened her eyes and
turned to look at Sam once more.  "Wake me up for dinner?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded nodding as she spoke, she was feeling a wee bit
out of it, she knew this because it didn't even occur to her to fight
with Brooke, no "what am I?  Your freaking butler?", no "yes
highness, would you like me to fan while I'm at it?", no "This may be
the Plaza but that ain't on the room serve menu", just `yeah'.  Sam
continued to watch Brooke as Brooke continued to look at her but then
the blonde turned away and closed her eyes once again, and Sam too
looked away suddenly deciding that what the room desperately needed
was some ice.</p>
