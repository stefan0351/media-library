<!-- The Closet \ Part Seventeen: Day Three -->

<p>The Kennedy students silently trekked through the empty early morning
hallways of the Museum of Modern Art.  Brooke and Sam were still
missing and they had been woken up extra early but an especially surly
Bio Glass.  A security guard at the museum had gone over the tapes for
the museum and had found evidence of Sam and Brooke moving through the
museum about ten minutes before closing time, but had found no footage
of them at any of the exits which meant they were still in the museum
somewhere.  So, with that evidence in hand, Glass had dragged everyone
back to the museum to begin The Search for Spock…I mean, Brooke and
Sam.</p>

<p>"We've checked all of the washroom and closets on the first floor,"
Security guard Bob was saying to Bio as they all marched through the
hallways.  "Our next stop is on the second floor, the janitorial
closet by the Pollack exhibit.  If we don't have any luck there, there
are three washrooms, and a maintenance closet that still have to be
checked."</p>

<p>Bio simply snared at the man in response.</p>

<p>"In that case…here we are," Bob said fumbling with his keys, not
ashamed to admit that the teacher to his side was terrifying him more
than any person he had ever meet before in life.  "Let's just open
this up and…"  Security guard Bob jumped back slightly as the door
flew open.  Out of the doorway rolled two girls, one blonde and one
brunette.  "Huh, looks like we found your…" but he was interrupted by
a shrill shrieking sound originating from somewhere behind him.</p>

<p>"OH MAH GOD!" Mary Cherry yelled.  "She's killed Brookie!" the
southerner continued pointing at Sam who had rolled out of the closet
on top of Brooke and was the first of the two of them to begin to wake
up.  "With those damn dirty whore hands of hers she has strangled the
life out of our dear precious one," Mary Cherry continued as tears ran
down her face leaving mascara trails in their wake.</p>

<p>"What the…" Sam muttered beyond disoriented, however despite that
having the presence of mind to roll off of a now waking up Brooke and
into a sitting position beside her before anymore could verbally
wonder what the hell she was doing on top of Brooke in the first
place.</p>

<p>Brooke raised her hand to her face and rubbed at her eyes sleepily.
What a freaky dream she had been having, she was Kenny from South Park
and Mary Cherry was yelling at some unfortunate soul accusing them of
murder.  Brooke shook her head as she forced her eyes open, that was a
damn weird dream.  Stretching, she opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ahhhhhhh!" the cheerleader screamed bolting upright and scrambling to
her feet in a panic.  Upon opening her eyes she was greeted to the
sight of a scowling Bio Glass whacking a ruler a against her hand.  An
image that was just too disturbing for words.</p>

<p>"Nice of you to join us McQueen," Glass said eyeing a now upright
Brooke like one of the worms they dissected in class.  "Now if you're
through demonstrating to the class that you do indeed wake up minty
fresh, we have more important matter to attend to," she went on
slapping the ruler against her hand once again.  Brooke shifted
uncomfortably and turned her attention to Sam who was of no help
whatsoever as she was involved in a detailed examination of her shoe.
 The cheerleader sighed, this was just going to be the best morning
ever!</p>
