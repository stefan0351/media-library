<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 25 -->

<p>Brooke looked across the hallway to where Sam was standing, then looked away
again.  She then shuffled her feet and pretended to be listening to what
Mary Cherry was saying before looking over at Sam once more then looking
away again.  She shuffled her feet some more, only stopping when Nicole
whacked her on the arm and shot her a deadly glare.</p>

<p>"Either go over there or stop staring at her, people are going to think you
paint clowns or something," the shorter blonde whispered harshly.  God how
she hated young love.  It reduced otherwise normal people into simpering,
annoying idiots.  It's like when the heart got filled up the brain fell out
or something.</p>

<p>"I just…I was…yeah okay," Brooke responded shifting her gaze between Nicole
and Sam once more before finally beginning to make her way across the hall
hesitantly, looking back at Nicole for moral support but only seeing a
disillusioned head shake.  It actually gave her the motivation that she
needed.</p>

<p>Having completed her trek across the hall, Brooke stopped beside Lily and
smiled at the occupants of the circle, which is to say Carmyn and Lily.
They smiled back at her.  Brooke smiled back at them and nodded her head.
They smiled back at her.  Brooke turned her head and smiled at Sam.</p>

<p>"Will you excuse us for a second," Sam said to the other two brunette's.
They nodded and Sam motioned from Brooke to follow her down the hallway a
little bit.</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke said still smiling once they were away from the other two.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam responded both amused and confused by Brooke's behavior.</p>

<p>"So uh, gym was pretty boring today huh?" Brooke asked.</p>

<p>"You mean the finer points of field hockey just didn't do it for you?" Sam
asked unconsciously rubbing at her shoulder where she had been hit with a
stick.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?  That looked like it hurt?" Brooke asked concentrating on
Sam's shoulder.  "I would have checked on you, but I feared for my life if I
left the penalty box."  Sam smirked.</p>

<p>"I feared for your life when you got sent to the penalty box," she responded
remembering the look of pure rage that had engulfed teachers face.  "What
did you say to her anyway?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember," Brooke responded shaking her head and rubbing at the
back of her neck.  "I wish I knew though, so that I could never, ever say it
again."</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment after that, Brooke's eyes drifting around
again, only settling on Sam for brief moments before skittering away once
again.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Sam asked finally.  She hadn't seen Brooke this jittery in a
while.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I mean…did ummm," Brooke started, her eyes flittering around there
immediate vicinity before settling on Sam once again, "I just…I was
wondering if you, you know, like had fun last night?" she asked looking at
Sam once more before her eyes started to roam nervously once more.</p>

<p>"It was the best date I've ever been on," Sam responded her heart swelling
as she smiled at the blonde reassuringly.  Brooke was nervous about how
their date had gone.  Considering that they had already made love, broken
up, gotten back together and declared their love for each other, Sam found
it both ludicrous and unbelievably charming that Brooke would be nervous
about how dinner had gone.</p>

<p>"It's the only date you've been on," Brooke pointed out reasonably, still
looking at her shoes.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'd say I'm off to an excellent start," Sam responded dipping her
head down trying to get Brooke to look up again.  When she did look up Sam
smiled at her tenderly and for the first time since Brooke had come over to
her she seemed to relax.  Sam shook her head, god how she loved this girl.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I'm telling you Jennifer 'call me love' Hewitt had a boob job," Cynthia
stated with absolute certainty.  "Have you seen 'I Know What you Did Last
Summer'?  Don't even try to tell me those things real.  She could use them
as floatation devices if she was ever in a plane crash," she continued as
she and her entourage-as she liked to think of them-made their way to their
lockers.</p>

<p>"But she seems so natural," Susan protested.  She liked 'call me love'
Hewitt.  She thought that she had spunk, and real talent.</p>

<p>"Yeah, natural like SMG's hair colour," Cynthia responded derisively as she
opened up her locker and began to unload her books.  Looking up her eyes
caught on a scene and stopped what she was doing to observe it.  "Okay, look
at that," she said gesturing towards Brooke and Sam who were standing off to
the end of the hallway talking to themselves.  "Does somebody want to tell
me what the fuck is up with that?" she asked looking around at the group
around her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that is kind of weird," Megan agreed observing the scene.  "I thought
they like hated each other or something."</p>

<p>"Yeah, don't they like hate each other or something," Regan agreed.  "They
like hate each other."</p>

<p>"They can't hate each other too much," Cynthia replied looking at them with
narrowed eyes.  "I saw them having dinner together last night."</p>

<p>"Their parents probably want them to be like friends or something.  Think
about how they act at school and imagine what they must be like a home,"
Susan suggested.</p>

<p>"They were there alone," Cynthia responded, "And they seemed to be getting
along just fine."</p>

<p>"Sam hasn't written any damaging articles about the popular's in a long
time," Megan observed keenly.  "Maybe they don't hate each other anymore.
Maybe they're like friends now."</p>

<p>"Thank you for that insightful commentary," Cynthia muttered under her
breath.  She was certain that she had already covered that and with much
more flare and wit than Megan.  "I'd kill to find out what happened though.
Blood feuds just don't end over night."</p>

<p>"Romeo and Juliet ended their blood feud by falling in love," Regan
commented in a dreamy tone.  Cynthia rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I can just see Brooke climbing up to Sam's window declaring that she
is the sun and Sam the moon," she responded, which resulted in a good laugh
for all.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Harrison observed Brooke and Sam from his position just down the hall from
them.  He had joined Carmen and Lily shortly after Sam had pulled Brooke
away, and had immediately taken up spying on them.  When Brooke had began to
talk she had looked nervous, fidgeting with her hands and looking about her
anxiously, but she had calmed down soon after she began to speak to Sam and
they were now speaking with each other comfortably.  Every once in a while
he would see one them make a motion with her hand, or one of them turn to
the side trying to smother a laugh, and more than once in a while he would
see one of them look at the other in brief, intimate glances.</p>

<p>"Don't even think about going over there and starting something," Carmen
warned him, drawing Harrison out of his trance.  "They've been suffocated
for the past week and they don't need you going over there with outstretched
hands."</p>

<p>Harrison looked over at her with a slightly surprised look on his face.  Her
was surprised by the barely veiled hostility in her voice.  She wasn't
making a comment, she was issuing a warning.  He was not to go and upset
them or else.  He sighed, then focused on Carmen for the first time since
his muttered 'hello'.</p>

<p>"I know," he mumbled contritely.  Suddenly he was a four year old who had
been caught with freshly baked chocolate cake all over his face.  "I know I
was wrong," he continued shifting his position uncomfortably.  He had spent
the previous night looking through old photo albums, looking at old photos
of him trying to launch Sam off of the teeter totter, and Brooke using him
as life sized Barbie doll to try out her five year old hair styles etcetera,
etcetera.  And as he looked through the photo's he was reminded what a big
portion of his life they both held, but Sam especially.</p>

<p>As Brooke's words played through his head, he knew that she was right, and
that acting the way he was acting would only hurt him.  Because, Sam had
Brooke and Brooke had Sam, and if he went on playing his asshole games, it
was clear that he would have no one, especially since Carmen had just made
it very clear that she was onboard with Sam and Brooke, and where Carmen
went Lily went.  He supposed that it would take time for him to actually
become okay with the situation, that this feeling for them wouldn't just
disappear over night, but he realized that be better start acting a friend
instead of non-ex-boyfriend or else he wouldn't have a chance to make it up
to them.</p>

<p>"I'm going over there," he announced a moment later, looking between Carm
and Lily.  "But I swear I go in peace," he continued.  They looked at him
dubiously, but said nothing.  It was his right to wrong, and his wrong to
make even wronger if he should so choose.</p>

<p>Brooke was the first to spot his approach, which wasn't really surprising
considering that she was facing him, and she watched it inquisitively.  Sam
turned around shortly after Brooke spotted him, no doubt wondering what had
caught her girlfriends attention, and she then watched him too, her body
tensing perceptively and her lips thinning into a set line.</p>

<p>"Can I talk to you?" he asked once he reached them.  Sam shrugged.  "In
private?" he asked clarifying.  Sam hesitated.  "I'd rather not grovel in
the hallway," he said in response to her non-answer.  Brooke smiled
knowingly, and nudged Sam, who then glared at her but agreed to go off with
him nonetheless.</p>
