<!-- Starlight \ Part 17 -->

<p>Willow turned around to look at Buffy who was lying across her bed, her legs dangling off the side holding a pink stuffed pig up in the air.</p>

<p>&#34;It's good to see you too Mr. Gordo,&#34; Buffy said in that voice reserved for infants and pets. She brought the pig to her ear. &#34;No I missed you more,&#34; she said moving it back to it's former position.</p>

<p>Willow smiled fondly at the display and crossed over to Buffy's bed. Buffy had the pig at her ear again.</p>

<p>&#34;Who kept me warm?&#34; Buffy asked the pig as if clarifying something. &#34;Willow,&#34; the Slayer informed the pig in a confidential tone. &#34;Yes, yes, I know it's about time,&#34; Buffy went on glaring at the pig. &#34;Smartass,&#34; she finished placing it on the pillow.</p>

<p>&#34;Don't let me interrupt,&#34; Willow said when Buffy turned to face her.</p>

<p>&#34;He was beginning to get surly anyway,&#34; Buffy responded before turning her attention to Willow, a soft smile working its way across her face. Buffy patted the spot beside her on the bed. &#34;I won't bite,&#34; she said staring at Willow how was studying the spot where Buffy's hand lay with a positively scholarly interest. &#34;Unless you're into that sort of thing,&#34; Buffy added a moment later smirking.</p>

<p>Willow looked over at her with a suddenness that made Buffy wonder if her banter was bang on. Willow opened her mouth as if to respond but them instead of speaking she closed her mouth and walked over to the bed where she lay down beside Buffy. Once horizontal Willow shifted to get closer to Buffy but her progress was impeded. Buffy looked down at the object that was separating them. Reaching out she picked up the fuzzy pink toy otherwise known as Mr. Gordo and hurled him across the room. With that out of the way they proceeded to snuggles with no further interruption.</p>

<p>&#34;It's funny,&#34; Buffy comment as she felt Willow relax against her.</p>

<p>&#34;What is?&#34; Willow asked sighing contentedly.</p>

<p>&#34;I almost can't remember what it was like to go to sleep without you beside me,&#34; Buffy respond. And she wasn't just saying that to act like a romantic cheese ball either, it was the absolute truth.</p>

<p>Willow tilted her head up until she was looking into Buffy's eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;I know what you mean,&#34; she responded softly. &#34;It's like…like it was kismet…like we've just been waiting for this all along.&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment, then she raised an unsteady hand to the side of Willow's cheek and tenderly stroked the soft skin underneath her fingers.</p>

<p>&#34;I want to make love to you so much that it hurts,&#34; Buffy breathed out in a half whisper, half moan.</p>

<p>&#34;Well…I don't want you to be in pain,&#34; Willow responded in a slightly deeper voice than usual as she leaned into Buffy's touch. &#34;I think that we should do something to fix this situation.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I did promise you…consummation, didn't I?&#34; Buffy asked smiling in an involuntarily sensual way.</p>

<p>Willow smiled back up at her with a like expression and then leaned up bringing their lips together in an vibrant kiss that pulsed through their bodies starting at their joined lips and traveled throughout the rest of their bodies to the tips of their toes, leaving a trail of fire behind it that had them both quivering and gasping for air by the time they separated.</p>

<p>Buffy, who recovered first, pushed up onto her elbows and gently lay Willow down so that the hacker was flat on her back and leaned over her looking down at her with the sweetest, almost reverent expression on her face. Then, as if finally unable to contain the emotions flowing inside for a moment longer, she bent her head down and brought their lips together with an intensity that neither shocked or surprised either of them. Quite the opposite in fact, they both welcomed it. Craved it. It was the actualization of years of renounced and constrained love, lust, desire, want and need. It was the merging of two hearts, and it was violent, tender, beautiful and a myriad of other sensations that defy description.</p>

<p>Their hands roamed each others bodies, exploring and manipulating flesh along the way, removing clothes and discovering curves and they sought to fuse themselves together. Lips caressesed skin, and bodies arched into each other in a choreography as familiar to them as their own hands without ever having had to learn the steps. Tender words, and impassioned moans of ecstasy where released and received in kind. Slick bodies ground against each other, pushing and receiving, arcing and giving, taking and receiving, until in that last glorious moment they joined together one last time in a state of absolute rapture.</p>
