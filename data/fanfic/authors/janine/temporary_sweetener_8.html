<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 7 -->

<p>Sensing a presence beside her Cordelia turned her head to the side  slowly cracking her eyes open.  She hadn't seen Buffy since the  Slayer had taken off earlier that day to attend the meeting at Dawn's  school, and feeling rather tired and not wanting to be presumptuous  she had taken up her spot on the Summer's couch again and settled  in.  "Home a little late aren't we?" the brunette asked looking up  into Buffy's face.  "Either that or extremely early."</p>

<p>"I got distracted by a song and dance number," the Slayer responded  her eyes focused on Cordelia intensely.</p>

<p>"Excuse me?" the brunette asked wondering if it had been wise to  leave the blonde alone for so long.</p>

<p>"Nothing…I just had the strangest night," Buffy responded shaking her  distractedly.  "I'll tell you about it tomorrow," she continued  taking a step back and offering her hand to the brunette.</p>

<p>"Ummm," the brunette responded grasping the blonde's hand allowing  herself to be pulled into a standing position.  "I'll remember," she  said turning her head to the side to watch Buffy as the Slayer began  to lead them up the stairs.</p>

<p>"Of that I have no doubt," Buffy responded softly a small smile  drifting her across her face as she opened the door to her bedroom  allowing Cordelia to enter the room.  "I'll just have to do my best  to occupy you until then," she continued, her smile growing as she  watched the brunette lift her shirt over her head and fling it to the  side.</p>

<p>"Promises, promises," Cordelia mumbled turning around to face Buffy.  </p>

<p>They turned out to be the last coherent words she was able to emote  quite some time. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------</p>

<p>"Good morning, Buffy," Giles greeted as the blonde woman entered the  shop.</p>

<p>"Oh hey, did Dawn get off to school alright?" Willow asked looking up  as the Slayer entered the shop.  Buffy had been late getting down  that morning for some reason and the young brunette had been worried  about getting to school to time.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked turning distractedly to face Willow.  "Oh, uh,  yeah.  I think," she continued, the redhead's question finally  registering with her as she scanned the store for a certain  brunette.  One who wasn't at all happy with her for hurriedly taking  off earlier and thus avoiding the conversation she had promised to  have with her if the brunette let her have her way the night before.</p>

<p>"Respect the cruller. And tame the donut!" she heard Xander chanting  from her side.</p>

<p>"That's still funny, sweetie," Anya told him encouragingly on her way  to the counter.  However as Buffy turned her attention to Xander's  side and saw Cordelia staring at him sternly, she realized that Anya  was probably the only one who still found it amusing and that if she  didn't distract everyone with strange happens soon, Cordelia was  going to be looking at her with that expression.</p>

<p>"So, uh, no new research?" Buffy asked making her way into the middle  of the store.  "Nothing new going on?  Monsters or whatnot?" she  continued, ignoring the look Cordelia sent her as the others shook  their heads no.  "Good!" she declared upon seeing their  reactions.  "Good," she continued less certainly as the events of the  night before came back to her.  "Uh, so, did anybody ... uh ... last  night, you know, did anybody, um ... burst into song?"</p>

<p>"Merciful Zeus," Xander cried dropping his donut back onto the plate,  as the rest of the room's occupants rushed over to the table.</p>

<p>"We thought it was just us!" Willow stated excitedly looking over at  Tara.</p>

<p>"Well, I sang but I had my guitar at the hotel..." Giles responded  glancing at everyone else.</p>

<p>"It was bizarre. We were talking and then it was like-" Tara  interjected animatedly.</p>

<p>"You were in a musical!" Buffy said finishing Tara's sentence.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what it was," Cordelia said looking over at the two  girls.  "I'd heard noises but figured that what two people choose to  do in the sanctity of their own bedroom is…"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Tara responded nodding in Buffy's direction.  "And hey!" she  said looking at Cordelia who suddenly found the seam of her pants  extremely interesting.</p>

<p>"That would explain the huge backing orchestra I couldn't see and the  synchronized dancing from the room service chaps," Giles added  looking rather pleased at the turn the conversation had taken since  it meant that he wasn't going completely nutty.</p>

<p>"We did a whole duet about dish washing," Willow related.  "And  Cordelia accompanied us, no matter what she says."</p>

<p>"It was catchy, that's all," the brunette responded, even as she  thought back to the incident and realized that her participation had  been rather involuntary if highly amusing.</p>

<p>"And we were arguing and, and then everything rhymed and there were  harmonies and the dance with coconuts," Anya said jumping in not  liking the fact that Cordelia was speaking more than her.  Men liked  women who could speak.</p>

<p>"There was an entire verse about the couscous," Willow went on  shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Oh god the couscous," Cordelia muttered shaking her head.</p>

<p>"It was very disturbing," Xander said with a touch of bewilderment in  his voice.</p>

<p>"At least you didn't get couscous," the ex-cheerleader responded to  which Xander nodded.  That was very true.</p>

<p>"What did you sing about?" Giles asked looking at the Slayer.  This  discussion of couscous was getting them nowhere.</p>

<p>"I don't remember," the blonde replied, "but i-it seemed perfectly  normal."</p>

<p>"But disturbing.  And not the natural order of things," Xander added  in after Buffy finished speaking.  She probably just forgot to  mention that part, and he was nothing if not a helper.  "And do you  think it'll happen again?" he continued with a touch of dread in his  voice.  He really had more of an alone in the shower kind of singing  voice, definitely, but if this continued there were going to be  mountaintops and all that stuff and he just really wasn't up for that.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Giles said glancing down.  "I should look into it."</p>

<p>"With the books," Willow supplied.</p>

<p>"Of course with the books," Cordelia said shooting a look at Willow.   Like there was anything else with these people.</p>

<p>"Do we have any books on this?" Tara asked thoughtfully.  She'd never  come across a musical section before.</p>

<p>"Well we just gotta break it down," Xander said firmly.  "Look at the  factors before it happens again," he continued, "because I for one…"</p>

<p>"I've got a theory/ That it's a demon/ A dancing demon! /  No  something isn't right there," Giles began to sing, sitting down and  taking his glasses off in consternation.</p>

<p>"I've got a theory/ A kid is dreaming/ And we're all stuck inside his  wacky Broadway nightmare," Willow piped up as Tara accompanied her  with some jazz hands.</p>

<p>"I've got a theory we should work this out," Xander contributed.</p>

<p>"This isn't Fosse/ What are the jazz hands all about," Cordelia sang  shaking her head.  This was going to be a long, long, long, long,  long, long, couple of days.  And she didn't even need to have visions  to divine that.</p>
