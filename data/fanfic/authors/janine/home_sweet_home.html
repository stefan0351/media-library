<p>Buffy walked the familiar hallway shifting the bag on her shoulder. Stopping in front of a familiar door she stopped and smiled. Home. Or at least her new college version of it. A version she happened to be quite fond of actually. Opening the door she stepped in and dropped her bag. It was good to be back.</p>
<p>Willow looked up from her book when she heard the door open.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; she exclaimed happily a smile covering her face.</p>
<p>&#34;In the flesh,&#34; Buffy said smiling and heading over to the desk. &#34;Actually,&#34; she corrected. &#34;in her new shoes,&#34; she continued wiggling one of her feet. &#34;You like?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I see you had a good time with your Dad's Gold card,&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;And his Visa, and his Master Card, and…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;His American Express?&#34; Willow guessed.</p>
<p>&#34;Never leave for the mall without it,&#34; Buffy agreed with a grin.</p>
<p>&#34;So tell me what happened,&#34; Willow said standing up and moving over to her bed, while Buffy picked up her bag.</p>
<p>&#34;As you wish,&#34; Buffy responded following Willow over to her bed.</p>
<p>They were lying on Willow's bed. Buffy was stretched out across the foot of the bed with her legs dangling over the edge while Willow sat up at the top of the bed by the head board sitting with her knees drawn up to her chest.</p>
<p>&#34;What about Angel?&#34; Willow asked when Buffy ceased in her oration for a moment. Buffy had talked about everything from the what the salesclerk who sold her her shoes was wearing, to the colour of her fathers kitchen wear, but she still hadn't said anything about her ex yet.</p>
<p>&#34;Well, that curse thing must follow him around, cause Cordelia IS his secretary,&#34; Buffy said not taking her eyes off of the ceiling. &#34;From what I heard she's the same old C.C,&#34; Buffy continued. &#34;I almost feel sorry for L.A.&#34; When Willow didn't respond Buffy turned her head to look at her. &#34;But that's not what you wanted to know, is it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Not exactly,&#34; Willow answered. &#34;Although that was on the list.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And Angel's at the top of that list?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Right now he is,&#34; Willow responded.</p>
<p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Buffy agreed with a little half sigh. &#34;I accused him of sulking around in the shadows stalking me, and told him that it wasn't at all kosher. Then I told him that it wasn't his responsibility to protect me, and more importantly that I didn't want him to protect me. Unless of course it was a matter of life and death, which that incident was, but it was the principle behind it…the sulking and everything. Then a demon busted through his window, he killed it, and I left,&#34; Buffy said never taking her eyes off of Willow's.</p>
<p>&#34;That's it?&#34; Willow asked finding it hard to believe whatever happened lasted only five minutes. But, despite her skepticism she found herself hoping that it was all that happened. Willow liked Angel on an individual basis, but when he was around Buffy those feeling turned decidedly less friendly.</p>
<p>&#34;That's completely it,&#34; Buffy responded with a note of finality in her voice.</p>
<p>&#34;And you didn't get the slightest bit of happies seeing him again?&#34; Willow asked possessed by some sort of masochistic desire. She didn't really want to know if Buffy had gotten the happies, but at the same time she did. It was a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Buffy looked pensive, and thoughtful for a moment before responding.</p>
<p>&#34;Not really,&#34; Buffy responded softly. &#34;I mean, he's always going to be a fine specimen of maleness, but I didn't really feel anything except for…&#34; she kind of trailed off after that.</p>
<p>&#34;Except for what?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Sad,&#34; Buffy said softly. &#34;I didn't want to be there. Seeing him, being there, it was extremely depressing. I know that sounds really terrible, really, really, terrible seeing as how were went through hell together, literally, but the moment I walked in it was like this dark cloud descended upon me,&#34; Buffy continued. &#34;I guess I had forgotten what it felt like,&#34; she went on rapidly. &#34;Am I a horrible person? I mean, at one point I was considering spending my life with him.&#34;</p>
<p>When Willow heard the self-depreciating tone in Buffy's voice she moved from her position in the bed so that she was lying beside Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;You're not a bad person, I repeat, not, a bad person,&#34; Willow said firmly. &#34;And well, know I say this with the best of intentions, but well, Angel has never been a ray of sunshine, what with the black, black and more black. Not to mention the whole cursed for eternity thing,&#34; Willow continued. &#34;I think that maybe you've gotten used to bright colors. There's a lot of fusha on the campus.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy smiled momentarily before turning serious once again.</p>
<p>&#34;Whatever the reason things have changed, it's like…it's just…not like before,&#34; Buffy said struggling to find the right words. &#34;The way it is now, him there and me here. That's the way it should be. I'm more certain of it mow than ever before,&#34; Buffy continued turning her head until she was looking Willow in the eye. &#34;I hated him for leaving me at first, I was scared because being with him was all I had known for so long. But…leaving, taking off and going to L.A, was the best thing he could have done for both of us.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You're happier now?&#34; Willow asked holding Buffy's gaze.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Buffy said softly. &#34;I am.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow felt a smile working it's way across her face and turned her head so that Buffy couldn't see her. The summersault's her stomach had been doing since Buffy left for L.A. had finally stopped.</p>
<p>&#34;How are you doing, Will?&#34; Buffy asked watching her friend. Since they had moved in together, Buffy had become considerably more proficient at reading Willow's emotions. Well, the fact that they were now living together, and that Buffy paid rabid attention to anything Willow. The emotions her friend was sending out currently were really jumbled, and that usually meant issues.</p>
<p>&#34;A lot better now that you're back,&#34; Willow responded without thinking. She was about to start regretting her answer, but she saw Buffy flash her a beatific smile and was instantly glad that she had said it.</p>
<p>&#34;That's good,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;Because it's good to be back,&#34; she continued. &#34;You sure you're okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Definitely,&#34; Willow responded. &#34;Just too much quality Xander and Anya time,&#34; Willow continued making a face. &#34;You're lucky you got out of here before Xander fully recovered from his Syphilis. It got scary after that…really, really, scary.</p>
<p>&#34;Was Anya thinking about having sex with him again?&#34; Buffy asked with a sardonic grin remembering the oh so unappetizing conversation they had been a party to at the dig.</p>
<p>&#34;Not only did she think about, but she tried to do,&#34; Willow responded making a face. Buffy could see the grumble, grumble written all over Willow's face.</p>
<p>&#34;Poor Willow,&#34; Buffy said patting her on the top of her head.</p>
<p>&#34;Poor, poor, Willow,&#34; Willow responded turning her head to the side until her forehead was resting against Buffy's shoulder.</p>
<p>They stayed like that for long, silent moments. Both of them reveling in the closeness of their bond. They were both aware of what they were feeling, but were in doubt of what the other was. What they did know for sure, however, was that they shared an affection that was tangible, and no matter what the other may or may not have been felling, they had that, and as long as they had that it'd be enough.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy leaned her arms on the sill of the window and stuck her head outside. The air outside wasn't exactly cold, but it was most definitely better than inside the room. It'd been a week since she'd gotten back from L.A, and she wasn't really sure how or why, but she could feel that things had changed between her and Willow. They had gotten closer, more comfortable around each other. The tension that had been there after the bad beer incident had faded into the background, and Buffy was wishing her memories of the night in question would fade as well. The reason she was sticking her head out of the window, just like she had the night before, was because she kept on thinking about that night. She could feel Willow's lips on her, feel her body pressing against Willow's, feel her warmth. The slightest things would cause the feelings to rise in her, and then she couldn't put them back.</p>
<p>It was frigging irritating. Not for the first time she had gotten herself worked up into quite a state, and again not for the first time there was nothing that she could do about it. She couldn't get relief from the person she wanted, and she couldn't even do it herself, because she made too much noise during the act of auto-erotic exhilaration, and couldn't chance, well, the chance.</p>
<p>Buffy took a deep breath then released it softly. Willow was standing behind her, she could feel it.</p>
<p>&#34;Is there something out there?&#34; Willow asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#34;Trees, stars…more tress,&#34; Buffy responded turning around.</p>
<p>&#34;You know where else they have those?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Trees?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow nodded. &#34;Where?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Everywhere,&#34; the hacker responded.</p>
<p>&#34;Funny,&#34; Buffy said moving over to sit on her bed.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Willow asked taking a seat beside Buffy. &#34;You seem kind of…distracted.&#34; Buffy looked down at her lap. &#34;And your ears are all red.&#34;</p>
<p>When Willow said that Buffy's hands flew straight to her ears. Her ears were red, great, Buffy thought. Only two things made her ears turn red. Extreme cold, and extreme arousal.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm fine,&#34; Buffy responded with a smile. &#34;Really.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If you say so,&#34; Willow said thinking that she should probably move since she was practically sitting on top of Buffy, but not really wanting to move at all.</p>
<p>&#34;I say so,&#34; Buffy responded.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy ducked and turned around raising her hand blocking one of the vampires intended blows. The beast growled and Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry, please try again,&#34; Buffy said ducking down and sweeping the vamps legs out from underneath it. &#34;The uglier they are, they harder they fall,&#34; Buffy said turning her attention away from the vampire on the ground to one of his buddies.</p>
<p>Buffy round-housed the vamp behind her, then punched him in the stomach. When the beast bent over in pain Buffy elbowed him on the back knocking him to the ground.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy, behind you!&#34; Willow yelled from her DSP (designated safety position).</p>
<p>&#34;I'm on it,&#34; Buffy yelled back flashing a smile at her companion. &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow was about to respond when she sensed a presence behind her. Turning her head slightly to the side she stopped a vampire closing in on her from behind some nearby bushes. Moving to the side she picked up a nearby metal garbage container and threw it at the vampire closing in on her. She was about to call for Buffy when she looked over and saw the Slayer over come by vamps. They were swarming her like locusts.</p>
<p>By the time Willow remembered about the vampire that had been coming after her he had grabbed her and pushed her up against a tree.</p>
<p>&#34;Looky, what Rufus found,&#34; the vampire said tightening the hold he had on Willow's throat. &#34;The Slayer's little bitch,&#34; he continued snaring. Willow raised one of her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&#34;Little?&#34; she managed to squeak out. She was at least an inch taller than Buffy. She wasn't Buffy's 'little' anything.</p>
<p>&#34;Rufus wants a taste, if it's good enough for the Slayer it's good enough for me,&#34; continued.</p>
<p>Willow ignored him instead concentrating on the vampires in the distance that Buffy was fighting with. She had managed to dispatch of a few of them, but there were still so many. That's when Willow saw it. Buffy was wearing some stakes in her hair, those ones that looked like chop sticks.</p>
<p>&#34;It's gonna be so sweet sucking your…&#34; Rufus was saying.</p>
<p>&#34;Could you do me favor, and just be quiet for five seconds?&#34; Willow asked. Rufus growled, but once again she ignored him. If this was going to work she had to concentrate completely.</p>
<p>Focusing on Buffy's head, Willow managed to mentally remove on of the stakes in Buffy hair. Then, concentrating on the vampire closet to Buffy, Willow sent the stake flying straight into his heart. Seeing one of their comrades explode into dust distracted the other vamps, and Buffy with Willow's assistance was able to dust the rest of them rather quickly.</p>
<p>Turning to face the last vampire, Buffy pulled out her stake.</p>
<p>&#34;This time, stay dead!&#34; she said shoving it into this heart and watching as he exploded. &#34;Two thumbs up for…&#34; Buffy started to say turning to congratulate Willow when she saw her friend being pushed up against a tree by a vamp.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow!&#34; Buffy shouted sprinting over to the tree.</p>
<p>By the time Buffy the tree Willow was slumped over in the vampires grasp, and the beasts head was lowered to her neck. Buffy reached out and grabbed the vampire by his shirt pulling him away from Willow and flinging him onto the ground.</p>
<p>&#34;I swear to God, that if you finished what you were doing, eternal damnation will seem like a picnic compared to what I'll do to you,&#34; Buffy said icily staring a hole into the demon.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm hungry,&#34; Rufus complained, thinking that he really should have just gotten on with eating.</p>
<p>&#34;Well, you shouldn't play with your food,&#34; Buffy said closing in on him. &#34;Gives you indigestion,&#34; she said shoving the stake into his heart, then turning and running back over to Willow.</p>
<p>Willow lay crouched on the ground, she wasn't moving. Buffy kneeled down beside her and gently tipped her head up so that she could see her face.</p>
<p>&#34;Will?&#34; Buffy said softly. &#34;Come on Will, open your eyes,&#34; Buffy urged rubbing the hackers cheek. The Slayer could clearly she the marks left by the vampires hand on her friends neck.</p>
<p>&#34;Come on Willow,&#34; Buffy said beginning to panic. &#34;Wake up,&#34; she continued lying Willow down on the ground. After pausing for a fraction of a second Buffy tilted Willow's head back and used her free hand to open her mouth. Leaning down she brought their lips together and blew into Willow's mouth. Pulling back she freed her hand and started to pump on Willow's chest. &#34;Wake up dammit!&#34; Buffy yelled getting increasingly agitated.</p>
<p>She leaned back down, blowing into Willow's mouth then pulled up and started pumping on her chest again. She continued this a few more times still getting no result. She could feel tears falling down her face, but she couldn't concentrate on that at the moment.</p>
<p>&#34;You wake up!&#34; Buffy yelled. &#34;Right now, goddammit,&#34; she continued still pumping on Willow's chest. &#34;Don't you leave me,&#34; Buffy continued. &#34;Please,&#34; she said lowering her forehead to Willow's. &#34;Please, don't leave me…please…don't leave me,&#34; she continued softly.</p>
<p>There was still no reaction.</p>
<p>Buffy raised up her head after a moment and looked down at the pale face below her. Willow was not dead, Buffy refused to believe it. Willow was not, could not be dead. It wasn't suppose to happen this way. Willow was not suppose to die before her, the fight Buffy fought was not Willow's to fight and more importantly NOT Willow's to die for. She hadn't even told her how much she loved her. She hadn't gotten a chance to tell her that she was her life.</p>
<p>&#34;Wil-low!!!!!!!!!!!&#34; Buffy yelled out into the air, slamming her hand onto her chest.</p>
<p>There was still no response.</p>
<p>Buffy's body heaved, her body overcome by tears. Her head dropped to Willow's chest, sobbing.</p>
<p>That's when she felt it. A slight lifting and depressing of the chest below her.</p>
<p>&#34;Bu-ff-y,&#34; Willow said softly. Her voice barely audible, so soft anyone but Buffy would have missed it.</p>
<p>&#34;Will?&#34; Buffy said precariously raising her head up so that she could see Willow's face.</p>
<p>&#34;Did we win?&#34; Willow asked, her gaze still unfocused. &#34;Cause I think we won, but I'm not really feeling like the winner over here.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We won,&#34; Buffy said drawing Willow into an embrace.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh,&#34; Willow said, sinking into Buffy's embrace. &#34;Good.&#34;</p>

<p>Once Willow regained consciousness Buffy picked her up and carried her back to their room, careful not to further jostle her. Once they had gotten back to the room, Buffy placed Willow down on the bed and tucked her in. The Slayer then spent the next half and hour fussing around offering to get Willow everything from a bottle of water to a foot massage.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Willow said finally. Buffy turned around and was at Willow's side almost before Willow had finished saying her name.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Buffy asked scanning Willow's body with her eyes. &#34;Do you want some Aspirin?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;Something to eat. I could go get you something to eat.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm okay Buffy,&#34; Willow said seriously. Sure, her neck hurt a bit, but she wasn't on her death bed.</p>
<p>&#34;You died,&#34; Buffy said her voice raising. &#34;I don't think that's okay. In fact I would say that's the exact opposite of okay. If okay was place, you wouldn't even have been able to see it from where you were,&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Willow said watching Buffy closely. &#34;Perhaps, okay isn't the right word for it, but I'll be fine,&#34; she continued. &#34;Sit down Buffy,&#34; Willow said reaching out to her, &#34;you look worse than I do.&#34; Buffy looked at Willow with a raised eyebrow. &#34;Well you do,&#34; Willow said. &#34;You look like you just lost your best friend.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I did,&#34; Buffy said looking down at Willow. &#34;I thought…you wouldn't…no matter what I tried I couldn't get you breathe,&#34; Buffy said stumbling over her words. Tears were starting to form in her eyes again. &#34;When I saw you lying there, I felt…I felt like I was going to die too.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm sorry,&#34; Willow said reaching one of her hands up so that she could rest it on Buffy's arm.</p>
<p>&#34;You don't have anything to be sorry for,&#34; Buffy said looking down at her. &#34;I'm the one who didn't do anything. Who wasn't there, when the only person who's stood by me unconditionally needed me. YOU have nothing to apologize for Willow, I'm the one who should be apologizing,&#34; Buffy continued. &#34;More than that I should be kneeling at your feet begging for forgiveness.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You were doing your job Buffy, you're the Slayer, you're suppose to concentrate on killing the vampires, not on babysitting me. What happened wasn't your fault, I had time, I could have…&#34; Willow trailed off.</p>
<p>&#34;Could have what?&#34; Buffy asked looking at her intently.</p>
<p>&#34;I had time to stake him,&#34; Willow said softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Why didn't you?&#34; Buffy asked. She wasn't angry, just confused.</p>
<p>&#34;Because I was staking the ones attacking you,&#34; Willow responded.</p>
<p>Buffy stared at her for a moment silently, then stood up and walked away from the bed. She paced for a moment, then returned to the bed looking at Willow intently.</p>
<p>&#34;I understand what you were doing Will, I do, I really do,&#34; Buffy said calmly. &#34;But, don't ever, EVER, do that again,&#34; Buffy said her voice raising slightly.</p>
<p>Willow starred at her for a second, then felt her ire start to rise.</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Willow asked angrily. &#34;You're the only one who gets to do good? Who gets to risk their life to save others? I didn't stay in Sunnydale to do paperwork for you, I stayed to help you, help you fight, help you survive,&#34; Willow continued.</p>
<p>&#34;Help me die too, Will? Huh?&#34; Buffy shot back. &#34;Because that's what 'doing good' is going to do to me eventually,&#34; Buffy said standing up. &#34;I'm going to be ripped apart by some demon, or have all of my blood sucked out of my body,&#34; she continued. &#34;I risk my life because I have too, the whole reason I'm alive is to fight and die for other people. I'm a martyr Will, and hate it. Because you know what you have to do to be a martyr….huh?…You have to die!</p>
<p>&#34;I have to die, Will, I have to die for them. You don't. You don't!&#34; Buffy said sitting back down beside Willow. &#34;I love you, and I don't want anything to happen to you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I love you too, Buffy,&#34; Willow said. &#34;I don't want anything to happen to either,&#34; she continued. &#34;Do you think I could just by and watch you die anymore than you could stand by and watch me die? Do you? ….I know you don't. It doesn't work that way Buffy, I didn't have a choice tonight anymore than you did.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't think that I could stand it if anything happened to you because of me,&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;I know I couldn't stand it if anything happened to you, and I wasn't there to help, to try and save you,&#34; Willow told her.</p>
<p>Buffy stared at Willow for a moment, then got up and walked over to her bed, flopping down on it.</p>
<p>&#34;Will?&#34; Buffy asked after a moment of lying in silence.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Willow responded staring at her ceiling.</p>
<p>&#34;I remember,&#34; Buffy said softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Remember what?&#34; Willow asked quizzically. She wasn't following. Buffy did this all the time, she would just change subjects at random leaving everyone else totally lost. Willow herself didn't have the longest attention span in the world, but hers was practically immortal compared to Buffy's.</p>
<p>&#34;That night that I drunk that bad beer,&#34; Buffy explained closing her eyes. &#34;I remember everything that happened.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You do?&#34; Willow asked after remaining silent for a moment. &#34;Everything?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Everything,&#34; Buffy confirmed.</p>
<p>&#34;For how long?&#34; Willow asked. She wasn't sure how to feel about this, even more she wasn't sure why Buffy decided to bring it up then.</p>
<p>&#34;Since that morning,&#34; Buffy said softly preparing for the inevitable. She was really going to have to start learning how to lie better, or she was going to have to start telling the truth from the beginning, because Willow could give guilt trips that would make her Jewish mother proud.</p>
<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>Buffy remained silent.</p>
<p>&#34;Why didn't you tell me?&#34; Willow asked. &#34;I asked you, I asked if you remembered,&#34; she continued softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Because,&#34; Buffy said still trying to organize her thoughts. &#34;Because,&#34; she said again.</p>
<p>&#34;That's not an answer Buffy, that's a stutter,&#34; Willow responded.</p>
<p>&#34;It all changed then,&#34; Buffy responded softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Nothing had to, has to, change unless we want it to,&#34; Willow said trying to keep her answer as neutral as possible. She still wasn't sure where Buffy was going with all of this, and the 'change' talk unsettled her because change was either good or bad, and when there was a chance of fifty per cent badness she usually wasn't a fan of the situation.</p>
<p>&#34;I want it to,&#34; Buffy responded quickly. It most situations she had courage in leaps and bounds, and would sometimes stand around and chat with her enemies before killing them, but this was not one of those times. She had to get it out then, or wouldn't get out for a long time. &#34;And I didn't realize how much, until for a moment, just one moment I was able to hold you in my arms. And feel your lips against mine,&#34; Buffy continued slower now, her voice cracking. &#34;I…I lied before, when I told you that I love you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Willow asked in a tone identical to Buffy's.</p>
<p>&#34;I don't just love you Will. I'm IN love with you. Meeting you for lunch, coming back here to talk to you about what happened during the day…just being in your presence, are the highlights of my day. I live for them. And I didn't realize, until this night…until I thought I lost you, that I live for you.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy didn't hear Willow get up so much as she felt her presence get closer. The hacker didn't say anything, she merely walked over to Buffy's bed, and sat down on the edge of it.</p>
<p>&#34;I've been thinking about that night a lot,&#34; Willow said once she was seated. &#34;I've been thinking about you, and me and…us, I guess, a lot too,&#34; Willow continued. &#34;You know I love you, don't you?&#34; Willow asked placing her hand on Buffy's thigh.</p>
<p>Buffy remained silent for a moment, then she sighed deeply, a morose smile working it's way across her face. Willow was trying to let her down gently she realized. Knowing Willow she probably even felt bad that she didn't feel the same way. Buffy wouldn't have that, she put a stop to it here and know. If anything at least Willow's reaction had assured her that they'd still remain friends.</p>
<p>&#34;You don't have to do this Will,&#34; Buffy said quietly. &#34;I know you love me. I didn't tell you what I told you because I expected anything in return, or even because I expected you to return my feelings. I just wanted you to understand.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I do understand,&#34; Willow said tenderly. &#34;More importantly, I know how you're feeling because I feel the same the way. I think maybe it took me longer to realize…okay it DID take me longer to realize exactly what I was feeling, but once I figured it out…&#34; Willow trailed off not knowing exactly how to express what she was feeling. &#34;That was it, completely it…it was all filled up.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy sat up on the bed so that she could see Willow's face.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you mean that?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;Do you really mean that?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;With every fiber of my being, and then some,&#34; Willow responded smiling.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you know what I've been dreaming about doing for almost a month now?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I can guess,&#34; Willow responded with a mischievous little smile on her face.</p>
<p>&#34;Can I kiss you?&#34; Buffy asked. There was such vulnerability in her voice that Willow thought her heart was going to break.</p>
<p>&#34;Hell yes,&#34; Willow responded. Buffy smiled, then slowly leaned in bringing their lips together. The kiss started out soft, slow, as they both got used to the idea that they were really kissing. Not with the aid of any drugs or outside influences, but completely of their own free will. But soon, the kiss turned increasingly passionate as months, nay, years of repressed want consumed them both.</p>
<p>Buffy's mouth was insistent, demanding, soft moans melting into Willow as Buffy's hands held her closely, pressing them together firmly. From their knees upward Willow was pressed tightly against Buffy's body, as they devoured each other, kissing deeply, giving and receiving, holding tight and letting go. Their breathing quickened as they sought to devour one another utterly, no thoughts remaining except for the luscious excitement sweeping them up and pulling them together. Buffy releasing sweet sounds from deep in her throat, her tongue sliding over her lips softly exploring, withdrawing, kneading, consuming. Their mouths seeking each other out again and again, in short hungry kisses, as if they couldn't bear to let it end.</p>
<p>For several elated seconds, they sat motionless, eyes closed as they savored the sweetness of it all. It was so incredibly good, so ardent and new, and wonderful. Finally, they pulled away from each other struggling for breath, still holding each other close not wanting to break the connection between them.</p>
<p>&#34;Your ears are red,&#34; Willow said gently touching one of Buffy's ears.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, well…it's cold in here,&#34; Buffy said looking down at the blanket. Stupid ears, Buffy thought.</p>
<p>&#34;No it's not,&#34; Willow said a smile starting to work it's way across her face.</p>
<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Buffy said smiling a bit, still looking down at the blanket.</p>
<p>&#34;What were you thinking about that night two days ago?&#34; Willow asked drawing her body closer to Buffy's.</p>
<p>&#34;What night?&#34; Buffy asked. Willow just stared at her. &#34;Okay, okay. I was thinking about something along the lines of what we just did.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Was it as good as you thought it would be?&#34; Willow inquired softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Better,&#34; Buffy said looking Willow straight in the eyes. &#34;Much, much…much, better.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How much better?&#34; Willow asked smiling.</p>
<p>&#34;Much, much, much,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;Will?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Uh huh,&#34; Willow responded.</p>
<p>&#34;Can I kiss you again?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;I really, really, liked that part.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;On one condition,&#34; Willow said her eyes glowing happily.</p>
<p>&#34;What's that?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow stay here,&#34; Willow responded in her cave-girl voice.</p>
<p>Buffy laughed.</p>
<p>&#34;I wouldn't have it any other way,&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>They sat staring into one another's eyes for a few long moments, both caught up in an impossible yearning, aware of one another's desire. Willow's eyes lowered to take in Buffy's slightly parted lips, as well as the lovely line of her throat. Finally, Buffy raised her hand to Willow's cheek and stroked it slowly with the backs of her fingers. Willow cupped Buffy's face acutely aware of the warm breath on her hand as Buffy moved against her gently. Shifting closer Willow raised her head feeling Buffy's warm breath on her lips, as they migrated towards each other.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow,&#34; Buffy breathed pulling away. &#34;I…&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know,&#34; Willow said pushing on Buffy's shoulders slightly to get the Slayer to lay down. &#34;And we will.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Now?&#34; Buffy asked eagerly. She sounded like a three year who was being denied ice-cream.</p>
<p>&#34;Shouldn't we talk about this,&#34; Willow said running her hand up and down Buffy's arm. &#34;Or something.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Uh, yeah talk, I guess that could be…no, no I don't think so,&#34; Buffy responded reaching up and bringing Willow lips back down to hers.</p>
<p>&#34;So the talking's not really a necessity?&#34; Willow asked dipping her head down to kiss along Buffy's jaw line.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you want the talking to be a necessity?&#34; Buffy asked seriously.</p>
<p>&#34;No, not really,&#34; Willow said. &#34;I've kind of got some more pressing issues. The talking suggestion just seemed like the mature thing to do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You didn't just say the M-word did you?&#34; Buffy asked in mock horror. &#34;No more field trips to Fort Giles for you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know how I'll ever manage to move on,&#34; Willow muttered. &#34;Oh, wait…idea,&#34; Willow said bringing her lips back to Buffy's.</p>
<p>&#34;I have to say Will, you've definitely got you idea getting skills back. After the whole cutting off her ear and dumping her own body thing I was starting to worry, but my faith is now completely renewed,&#34; Buffy responded slipping her hands under Willow shirt and running her hands along the skin she found underneath.</p>
<p>&#34;Everyone has their off days,&#34; Willow responded.</p>
<p>&#34;Now?&#34; Buffy asked again in the same tone she had earlier.</p>
<p>&#34;Sounds good to me,&#34; Willow responded with a smile.</p>
