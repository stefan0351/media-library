<p><b>2003 - Katie's Dorm Room</b></p>

<p>"Seriously," Katie half yelled, half laughed.
"Get out of here!" she continued pushing the lump of human lying on top of her
off. "Ugh!" she grunted feeling another body land on top of her. "How did
you interpret 'get out of here' to mean 'come on everyone join
in?'" she asked testily pushing on the bodies covering her. "Seriously,
this is long distance."</p>

<p>"Long distance?" Bob asked his eyes popping out
of his head feigning amazement. "J, did you hear that? It's long distance!"</p>

<p>"No," Julia gasped bringing her hand to her
mouth. "Long distance?"</p>

<p>"Long distance," Bob confirmed seriously.</p>

<p>"Get out!" Katie screeched throwing her pillow at
them.</p>

<p>"I live here," Julia pointed out.</p>

<p>"Which'll make it so much easier for me to get
back at you if you don't leave," Katie responded smiling at her.</p>

<p>"Fine. We're gone, we're gone," Julia
responded ushering Bob out of the room and closing the door.</p>

<p>"Who was that?" Jessie asked when she heard Katie
exhale into the receiver.</p>

<p>"Bob and Julia," she responded smiling at the
thought of the two of them as annoying as they were. "She's my roommate, and
he's some random guy that was opening all of the girls doors trying to catch us
naked, then going 'you're not Jessica' to make us think that he was
actually looking for someone," she continued.</p>

<p>"That's...pervy," Jessie replied letting
her head drop down onto her pillow. Katie sounded happy, she was glad that Katie sounded
happy, even if she was happy without her.</p>

<p>"Pretty much, we've decided to lock the door at
night, a missed kegger or two is worth keeping the place and anti-bob zone," Katie
responded flipping onto her back and staring up at the ceiling happily. "It's
good to hear your voice."</p>

<p>"You sound like you've been having a good
time," Jessie commented playing with the bottom of the material of her shirt.</p>

<p>"It's been wild," Katie agreed. "The
moment I stepped out of the van, you know from the airport, this crazy bald headed guy
came running up to me yelling and pointing in like three different directions at once, and
then things started to get weird. I feel like I haven't had a chance to breath,"
she continued shaking her head at the memory. Everything was like a blur. "And
everyone's so British. Billie, we had tea. In a tearoom!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jessie laughed, Katie's excitement drawing her in
making her genuinely excited too. "Earle Grey?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have no idea," Katie replied. "If
it's not Red Rose, I'm totally lost," she went on shaking her head.</p>

<p>"What's your roommate like?" Jessie asked,
picturing some tall, tanned model looking thing ready to pounce on her sweet, oblivious
girlfriend. She already hated the girl.</p>

<p>"She seems cool enough. She's from Scotland so
she sounds like a Fisherman's Friend commercial, but it's cool. She knows where
all the nearby art galleries and stuff are and said she'd show me around," Katie
replied staring down towards the foot of her bed. The wall of her closet was right by the
foot of her bed so she'd tacked up a blown up picture of Jessie smiling on a swing
set that she'd taken. "You know what she says?" Katie asked a moment later
staring at the picture.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked with a touch of trepidation,
she really didn't want Katie to already be telling her what some other chick
'says'. She really didn't.</p>

<p>"She says you're hot," Katie related
wickedly as she smiled.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked laughing at Katie's
tone.</p>

<p>"When she saw the gigantic, humungous, gargantuan
picture of you if have tacked to my wall and she asked who the hottie was," Katie
replied proudly. "She says I'm very lucky to have you. She stressed the very, a
lot though. Do you think that's just how they do it in Scotland, or was she hinting
at something?"</p>

<p>"You didn't get nervous and tell her that baby
story did you?" Jessie asked knowingly.</p>

<p>"Maybe. So what? That's a good story," Katie
replied not liking Jessie's tone.</p>

<p>"Sure it is," Jessie replied, thinking about the
story and that Julia was right. Katie was lucky to have her; she was the only person in
like the entire world who found that story amusing.</p>

<p>"I know what that 'sure it is' means,"
Katie said playfully. "I wish you could see this place Billie, it's amazing.
There's this great old building on the West side of campus, and we snuck up on the
roof, and the whole time we were up there, I was just thinking how perfect it would be up
there at night. Me, you and Billie Holiday."</p>

<p>"It sounds amazing," Jessie said thinking that
the most amazing thing that had happened at Sinclair in the past week was that the lockers
on the bottom floor got repainted. "So have you seen Bill yet?" she asked
needing to change the topic.</p>

<p>"No, but I'll be sure to call him that if we ever
run into each other. I'm sure he'll find it charming," Katie replied
laughing. "You know how you thought Evanston was small? Well you should see this
place, I swear the whole town only has like 16,000 people even though everyone keeps
telling me it's a 'city'," she continued shaking her head at the
memories of the Scots getting their panties in a twist over it. "In like two weeks
I'll probably know everyone. I swear I've been to baseball games with more
people."</p>

<p>"I see you and hyperbole have become close friends
since your move," Jessie commented, her eyes closing.</p>

<p>"Become?" Katie asked jokingly.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Jessie responded smiling though it
faded almost as soon as it appeared. "It's so weird, you haven't been gone
48 hours and I feel like I haven't seen in forever."</p>

<p>"Plus one," Katie joked though her tone was
serious. "I know. It's like it's real now."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said her mind racing back to
everything she had heard since she had picked up the phone. Katie talking about her
flight, and the van ride, and the Inn her parents were staying at, and her new friends,
and her new school. She felt like she was missing out on this huge part of Katie's
life and they hadn't even been separated for a whole week. What would she be missing
next week, next month? It hurt her heart to think about all the things they would be
experiencing without each other, almost more than she could bear. "I miss you."</p>

<p>"I miss you too Jess," Katie sighed, her eyes
drifting back to Jessie's picture. "I miss you too."</p>
