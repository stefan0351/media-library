<!-- Starlight \ Part 7 -->

<p>Buffy watched the proceedings at the table around her with an unavoidable discomfort. The kitchen table was covered with texts and maps, and they were all gathered around trying to prepare a course of action. Giles had narrowed down the area where they were most likely to find the demon and they had to figure out how they wanted to approach the situation. The area they were focused on were the caves on the concave of Sunnydale's shoreline.</p>

<p>&#34;What do you think, Buffy?&#34; Giles asked looking up and fixing his gaze on the Slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy met his gaze but then quickly looked away.</p>

<p>&#34;I don't know,&#34; she said slowly. She didn't need to look at Giles to know that his eyebrow was arched and he was looking at her questioningly.</p>

<p>&#34;Not even a suggestion?&#34; the watcher asked in response.</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged.</p>

<p>Giles observed her for a moment, then stood up and straightened his back to a rigidity anyone birthed outside of Europe would have thought to be impossible. As he did this Buffy continued to avoid his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Would you all be so kind as to give Buffy and I a moment alone?&#34; Giles asked turning to look at the other members of the table individually.</p>

<p>The members of the table shifted their attention from Giles to Buffy and then back to Giles again. There was a moments hesitation, then slowly Xander, Willow and Anya stood up and moved away from the table into the sitting room.</p>

<p>&#34;Would you like to get some fresh air?&#34; Giles asked turning his attention towards Buffy. With the other still in the house they wouldn't really be able to talk privately.</p>

<p>&#34;Would it matter if I said no?&#34; Buffy asked finally looking up at him.</p>

<p>&#34;Of course it would,&#34; Giles said looking down at Buffy gently. &#34;But I would prefer if we could take a short walk.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Then I'd love to get some fresh air,&#34; Buffy responded dryly.</p>

<p>Giles merely nodded and walked behind Buffy's chair. Grasping the handles he began to push her towards the door.</p>

<p>Buffy pointedly turned her face away from Giles, her lips were pressed together tightly in an attempt to contain her growing anger. So much for fresh air, she thought to herself, she was sitting in the middle of the Spanish fucking Inquisition. The moment they had hit sunlight Giles had started to lay into her about her behavior and she had just about had it.</p>

<p>&#34;…and I know that being placed in this position has been difficult for you. But you are still the Slayer, and you have responsibilities. This non-committence can't happen Buffy. There'll be plenty of time to…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I think the word your looking for is 'wallow',&#34; Buffy offered bitterly.</p>

<p>&#34;There'll be plenty of time to REFLECT on what's happened later,&#34; Giles continued ignoring Buffy's interjection. &#34;But right now we need you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Was I not there at the table?&#34; Buffy asked looking at him angrily. &#34;Was I not text reading girl? Was I not 'give a painfully descriptive account of your near death experience and the beast that did it' girl? Yes, I think I was all of those things, so please Giles, please because I'd really like to know…enlighten me as to where you're getting this absentee Buffy idea from?&#34; the Slayer finished shooting a look at him that could've turn him into stone.</p>

<p>&#34;No Buffy, sitting at the table not paying attention to anyone or anything does not constitute 'being there' where I come from.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah well, where you come from they call French fries chips, so you'll excuse me if I don't take your definition at face value,&#34; Buffy retorted.</p>

<p>&#34;You're being difficult,&#34; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&#34;And you're being a jerk,&#34; Buffy shot back.</p>

<p>&#34;I had hoped we could have a civilized conversation,&#34; Giles said softly as he took off his glasses and began to rub his eyes.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, and I once hoped to be given a bunny that would lay golden eggs,&#34; Buffy responded. &#34;We don't always get what we hope for, in fact most of the stuff we do get we wouldn't wish on our worst enemy,&#34; she continued looking down at her legs pointedly.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, well life kicked you in the ass so I suppose we should all just give up go home and drink some tea, and you can role over and commiserate with yourself next decade or so. As for the rest of the poor wankers in this town well they can just bloody well fend for themselves from now on, right? Because we can't be bloody bothered to help the wincers, can we?&#34; Giles said finishing his derisive tirade.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, that's just fantastic,&#34; Buffy responded antagonistically. &#34;I lose the use of my legs, find out my friends are preparing to embark upon a suicide mission, and I'm some sort of shallow asshole for being upset?&#34; Buffy asked in amazement. &#34;Am I the only one that realizes this is a normal human reaction? I know that we don't spend much time around actual honest to god humans, but I was fairly certain that we still were.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're right of course,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;It is a normal human reaction…but Buffy, you are not a normal human,&#34; Giles continued. Buffy looked at him sharply. &#34;And I know that you don't want to hear that right now. I know that in addition to being a Slayer you're a girl with normal girl feelings, but you have responsibilities that can't be put aside because you're sad. And I know that hand you've given can sometimes be horrible, but it IS your hand to play out.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Well…screw cards, I fold,&#34; Buffy said militantly. &#34;It's my paralysis and I'll cry if I want to.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy,&#34; Giles said in a more pleading tone. &#34;Please, help us help you.&#34;</p>

<p>Giles waited, but Buffy didn't respond.</p>

<p>&#34;Fine,&#34; the watcher responded. &#34;Have it your way,&#34; he continued then he walked around the fountain in his yard-that was curiously never on-and headed for the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; Buffy asked turning her head around to look at him.</p>

<p>&#34;Inside,&#34; Giles responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Wait! Giles ! You can't just leave me out here ! Giles…&#34; Buffy finally stopped calling it was no use. He was already inside.</p>

<p>Buffy turned her chair around angrily and started wheeling towards the door. Once she reached the door she angled the chair so that she could reach the handle, but it was of no use, the chair kept getting in the way of the door.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles!&#34; she yelled at the door.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>&#34;Where's Buffy?&#34; Willow asked as Giles walked back inside.</p>

<p>&#34;She's enjoying the fresh air,&#34; the watcher responded. &#34;Please, all of you come back over here.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But Giles,&#34; Willow said as the three of them headed over to the table. &#34;How's she going to get back in?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy's a resourceful girl,&#34; Giles responded leaning over his map of the shoreline.</p>

<p>&#34;But…&#34; it was Xander who tried to speak this time but Giles halted his protest.</p>

<p>&#34;I know what I'm doing,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;She needs this.&#34;</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, until a yell interrupted them. It was Buffy calling Giles's name from outside the door.</p>
