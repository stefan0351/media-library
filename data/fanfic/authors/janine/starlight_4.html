<!-- Starlight \ Part 4 -->

<p>Giles remained in the room for a few moments after Willow exited the room&nbsp;&nbsp;and continued to stare at the small figure that lay on his bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had&nbsp;&nbsp;said very little since Willow had come to get him, leaving the hacker to do&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the talking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had spoken when she was spoken too, but had&nbsp;&nbsp;volunteered little more than that.&nbsp;&nbsp;She now lay on the bed completely still&nbsp;&nbsp;staring at the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Giles sighed, then backed out of the room.</p>

<p>In Sunnydale, when it rained a monsoon was sure to follow.</p>

<p>&#34;We're got to find the demon,&#34; Willow said the moment Giles entered the&nbsp;&nbsp;common room.&nbsp;&nbsp;Xander had arrived while Giles was still in with Buffy and was&nbsp;&nbsp;standing slightly behind Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;We've got to calm down,&#34; Giles said taking his glasses off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;We can't go&nbsp;&nbsp;rushing into anything.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Nobody's rushing, we're taking tiny little baby steps here G-man.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's&nbsp;&nbsp;just that the solution isn't exactly playing hide and seek with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;fact, it's pretty damn simple, we find the demon,&#34; Xander responded moving&nbsp;&nbsp;in front of Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;That's not simple, that's suicidal,&#34; Giles responded in a more commanding&nbsp;&nbsp;tone than they had heard him use in a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;If the beast was easily&nbsp;&nbsp;killed we wouldn't be having his conversation, not mention that demons&nbsp;&nbsp;aren't exactly know to be particularly so-operative.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What we always do,&#34; Giles responded sighing.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had thought that the&nbsp;&nbsp;answer was fairly obvious.</p>

<p>&#34;I've got musty texts letters A-E,&#34; Xander called moving over to their&nbsp;&nbsp;make-shift study area, otherwise known as the couch.</p>

<p>&#34;Willow,&#34; Giles said turning to face the red-head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I need you to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy and try to get a description of what attacked her, and any other&nbsp;&nbsp;relevant information.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Giles, she's…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I know Willow,&#34; Giles said wearily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the longer we wait, the&nbsp;&nbsp;more her chances for recovery diminish.&nbsp;&nbsp;We've got to move quickly.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow merely nodded and started the walk back to the bedroom.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy's head was turned away from the door, towards the window, and from her&nbsp;&nbsp;position by the door Willow could only make out have of the Slayer's face.&nbsp;&nbsp; The part that she could see, however, held her captive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale light of&nbsp;&nbsp;the moon shone through the open window illuminating Buffy's face.&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;thought to herself, that lying there Buffy was the most beautiful and tragic&nbsp;&nbsp;sight that she had ever seen in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying there she looked like a&nbsp;&nbsp;painting by some French artist from the Rocco period-dreamlike, vulnerable,&nbsp;&nbsp;strong, mysterious, beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;A vision that left the viewer mesmerized and&nbsp;&nbsp;wondering what exactly was going on inside of that beautiful, tragic mind to&nbsp;&nbsp;produce such a picture of longing and loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching her, lying there&nbsp;&nbsp;looking so small, Willow felt a tear work it's way down her face for what&nbsp;&nbsp;had to have been the thousandth time that day, and like those other times&nbsp;&nbsp;she reached up and brushed it away, resolving not to let another fall,&nbsp;&nbsp;because she had to be strong-she, Giles, and Xander-they had to be strong&nbsp;&nbsp;for Buffy.</p>

<p>She made her way to the side of Buffy's bed as quietly as possible-though&nbsp;&nbsp;she knew the effort was folly since Buffy was certainly aware of her&nbsp;&nbsp;presence the moment she appeared in the doorway.&nbsp;&nbsp;And while Willow knew all&nbsp;&nbsp;of this she still proceeded stealthily, mot wanting to disturb the quiet or&nbsp;&nbsp;break the peace.</p>

<p>She stood by Buffy's bedside for a moment before reaching out ant gently&nbsp;&nbsp;placing a hand on her friend's shoulder.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm back,&#34; Willow said softly, even though she was aware of the banality of&nbsp;&nbsp;the statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had been in and out of the room all day alternating&nbsp;&nbsp;between spending time with Buffy and helping with the research.</p>

<p>&#34;I gathered,&#34; Buffy responded turning her around, finally, to face Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;We…the…Giles is out getting the…thing,&#34; Willow said searching for a gentle&nbsp;&nbsp;term for it, &#34;so we should be able to get you out of here by morning,&#34; she&nbsp;&nbsp;continued looking at the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some would have found Willow's vagueness&nbsp;&nbsp;confusing, but Buffy had been around the hacker long enough to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;decipher her babblings anytime or anyplace.</p>

<p>&#34;Is he going to Kramer me, or am I actually going to get one with a joystick&nbsp;&nbsp;and all those other do-dad's?&#34; Buffy asked a small, tortured, smile working&nbsp;&nbsp;it's way across her face.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was after all taking about the appropriation&nbsp;&nbsp;of her wheelchair.</p>

<p>&#34;State of the art, I'm pretty sure you could even launch rockets with this&nbsp;&nbsp;baby,&#34; Willow responded with a like expression on her face.</p>

<p>&#34;Rockets, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have settled for Tetris, but rockets are cool too.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure blowing up vampires makes them just as dead as staking them,&#34; Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;responded.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah…but littering,&#34; Willow responded, her lips curving up in an&nbsp;&nbsp;unconsciously erotic way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy licked her lips.</p>

<p>&#34;That's what we have convicts for,&#34; the Slayer responded dryly before&nbsp;&nbsp;turning her face back towards the window allowing Willow to observe her&nbsp;&nbsp;freely.</p>

<p>Willow-standing there in those moments watching Buffy in the&nbsp;&nbsp;moonlight-realized what had been bothering her about her friends behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;the past day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy was perhaps the most passionate person Willow had ever&nbsp;&nbsp;met and could ever expect to meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sparkly in Buffy's eyes, and&nbsp;&nbsp;an energy that coursed through her and pulsed off of her in waves spilling&nbsp;&nbsp;onto those in her presence, warming them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even in her darkest hours,&nbsp;&nbsp;when lesser people would give up and stop fighting, choosing instead to&nbsp;&nbsp;allow the waves to wash over them, Buffy remained strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;her step would falter, and her fears would rise, but despite that all she&nbsp;&nbsp;would go on.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her there was the heart of a warrior, and it made her fight&nbsp;&nbsp;the good fight, and fight it well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly being a member of the&nbsp;&nbsp;generation she was of, and being a member of the age group she was off,&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a jaded cynicism in Buffy, a kind of sarcastic pessimism about&nbsp;&nbsp;her, but Willow knew that those things were an asset, not a fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;Willow&nbsp;&nbsp;knew that a person without Buffy's sardonic sensibilities could not possibly&nbsp;&nbsp;have existed in the world Buffy occupied.&nbsp;&nbsp;To an untrained-or&nbsp;&nbsp;uncaring-person Buffy could seem cocky, but Willow knew that what they&nbsp;&nbsp;perceived as cockiness was in fact simply confidence, heightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy had&nbsp;&nbsp;to go into every fight believing that she was to be the victor, or else she&nbsp;&nbsp;would not come out of the fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was that defiance, that believe in&nbsp;&nbsp;self, that love of life, that caused that spark in Buffy's eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy&nbsp;&nbsp;would die anyway but her way, and if you messed with that she'd knock you&nbsp;&nbsp;down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaying, Willow came to realize in those moments, was the only thing&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy believed in absolutely.&nbsp;&nbsp;That in those dark days it was slaying that&nbsp;&nbsp;both cause and salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaying was to Buffy what taxes are to the rest&nbsp;&nbsp;of humanity, the only constant in life other than death.</p>

<p>During that day Willow had seen that spark in Buffy's eyes flicker and&nbsp;&nbsp;falter as if it wised to go burn out.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had sensed the horsemen closing&nbsp;&nbsp;in her friend's soul, galloping with their swords raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she realized&nbsp;&nbsp;that Buffy was afloat, unfettered from the one thing she had thought&nbsp;&nbsp;unfetterable, slaying.&nbsp;&nbsp;With a jarring suddenness Willow realized what it&nbsp;&nbsp;was Buffy needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;She needed an anchor, she needed something else to&nbsp;&nbsp;believe in.&nbsp;&nbsp;But who or what would have such audacity to think that they&nbsp;&nbsp;could replace slaying in a Slayer's life?</p>

<p>&#34;Willow?&#34;</p>

<p>Buffy's voice broke the hacker out of her musings.</p>

<p>&#34;What? Yeah?&#34; Willow asked blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>&#34;Have a nice trip?&#34; Buffy asked watching her carefully.</p>

<p>&#34;Sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a thought and it ran away,&#34; Willow responded trying to shake&nbsp;&nbsp;off the lingering effects of her musings.</p>

<p>&#34;Are you going back to the dorm when Giles gets back?&#34; Buffy asked in a&nbsp;&nbsp;carefully measured tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing she wanted to do was reveal how&nbsp;&nbsp;truly anxious she was at the thought of Willow not being around her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&nbsp;&nbsp;didn't want to guilt Willow into staying.</p>

<p>&#34;I…Giles when we talked earlier, I asked and he was fine with, I mean he&nbsp;&nbsp;said I could stay…if that's what you wanted…but I think that I should…I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;we both think that staying would be good because of aloneness being&nbsp;&nbsp;bad…which is why…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Will?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I want,&#34; Buffy responded smiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Wasn't really looking forward to the&nbsp;&nbsp;aloneness anyway,&#34; Buffy continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;And you are without a doubt my&nbsp;&nbsp;favorite person to not be alone with.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow smiled.</p>

<p>The moment Willow had settled herself into the bed Buffy moved closer to&nbsp;&nbsp;her.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not close enough to touch, but within a sufficient distance to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;to fell each others warmth.&nbsp;&nbsp;She-of course-wanted to do more, wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;reach out and pull Willow into her body and shower her face in sweet little&nbsp;&nbsp;kisses until they were both trembling.&nbsp;&nbsp;And she-of course-wanted to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;the deepest secrets of her soul and let all of the emotions that welled in&nbsp;&nbsp;her as she lay on the cold cemetery ground, while watching the distant stars&nbsp;&nbsp;mocking her, be known.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to tell Willow that she loved her.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;&nbsp;the words of the poet and with the actions of a lover, she wanted to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;her love.&nbsp;&nbsp;So she did the only thing she could do.&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;paused, then asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Comfy?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Snug as a bug in a rug,&#34; Willow replied.</p>

<p>&#34;Good.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yep.&#34;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&#34;You look pretty,&#34; Buffy blurted out into the silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had the&nbsp;&nbsp;subtleness of a marching band, she did.</p>

<p>Willow's eyes widened-the universal gesture of shock.</p>

<p>&#34;…good, you look pretty good all things considered,&#34; Buffy went on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&nbsp;&nbsp;were her sentiments now?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were her poetic words, and gentle caresses?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll tell you…they ran away, and now, Buffy: the vampire slayer-otherwise&nbsp;&nbsp;known as the bravest girl in all the world-was back peddling.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was back&nbsp;&nbsp;peddling like a son of a bastard, and could have given the world's best back&nbsp;&nbsp;peddlers a run for their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&#34;Not that you don't always look&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty...cause you do…just that with everything that's happened you look&nbsp;&nbsp;just as good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is good?&#34;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buffy winced mentally as the words left her&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning statements into questions was never a good thing, ever.</p>

<p>&#34;I…&#34; Willow started to respond, still somewhat shocked but in a pleasant&nbsp;&nbsp;enough way.</p>

<p>&#34;Right.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was fairly certain that she had not finished her&nbsp;&nbsp;sentence.</p>

<p>&#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;You're right, it is getting late.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;But I didn't say…&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Bed sounds good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep it is.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;'Night Will,&#34; Buffy said pointedly shutting her eyes and praying to God&nbsp;&nbsp;that Willow would just go along with it.</p>

<p>&#34;Good-nightttt,&#34; Willow responded drawing out the words in a tone that&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly conveyed she was at a complete lose as to what just happened.</p>
