<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 3 -->

<p>They came to the hospital with me after school.  Josh, and Lily,  Carmen and Harrison.  They stopped outside the door looking in,  hesitating.  They said that maybe they should come back later, that  she was sleeping.  But I knew she wasn't sleeping, I could tell from  the way her chest rose and fall and I walked into the room without  them.  She turned as soon as she heard my feet with her eyes were  still closed.  She could tell it was me the same way I knew she was  awake.  I told her had visitors and she looked past me to the door.</p>

<p>"Are they coming in, or should I yell to them over there?" she asked  returning her attention to me.</p>

<p>As they threaded into the room all shuffling feet and wondering eyes,  I backed away, retreated to my corner to watch the proceedings.</p>

<p>I wasn't surprised to see Brooke charm away their worry with an easy  smile and careless grace.  I knew that she had been handling  everything that happened far better than anyone else in the family.   Oh, I knew she was scared, and that she worried about her leg and  what could have happened, but there was a calm to her that the rest  of us didn't possess.  Know that I think about it, maybe calm wasn't  the right, the thing is I just don't know what is, maybe acceptance,  maybe not, but either way she had managed to pull herself together  much better than I had, and I was grateful for that because it made  me feel better every time I looked at her.</p>

<p>Harrison was the quietest of the bunch, and more than once I caught  him looking at me in my corner as I smiled softly at the others.    Sometimes I would meet his eyes, and together our guilty hearts would  commiserate together.  Like me, he couldn't help but blame himself  for what had happened, for the ménage trios of misery we had been  living in before the accident.  We were silly, silly children  suddenly forced to grow up.  After a while I stopped returning his  gaze, he was depressing me and I'd had quite enough of that in  previous days.</p>

<p>"Mom and Dad came by earlier," Brooke said to me after they had left  and I was returning to her after closing the door.  She had started  to refer to my mom as mom; it was kind of sweet although I had only  recently decided that.  I was still calling Mike just that, but it  wasn't out of resentment anymore or a desire for him to vanish from  my universe like it had been before, it was just that while I had  accepted him as my mothers husband, my sisters father, and a good,  kind man, I already had a father.  "I wondered where you were but…" </p>

<p>"They made me go back to school," I responded rather grumpily  slumping into the chair beside her bed.   "By the way everyone and  their brother wish you the best of luck."</p>

<p>"Bad day?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Just wasn't in the mood for it I guess.  Even Bio looked at me all  weepy eyed.  It was creepy," I responded shuddering slightly.  "It  looked like saline, like she had prepared the tears before class."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't put that past her," Brooke responded chucking slightly.</p>

<p>"And everybody was so polite, it was like being at an English  funeral.  I can't tell you how many times someone called me `dear',"  I went on feeling more sorry for myself as I continued.  "I hope it's  okay that I brought them by," I said suddenly changing the  subject.  "I didn't really bring them, they just kind of followed me  here, but they were worr…"</p>

<p>"It's fine," she said cutting me off.  "By the way, what was up with  Lily's fluorescent FTG pin?"</p>

<p>"Free the Gecko," I responded shaking my head.  "Don't ask me, I  don't know."</p>

<p>"Josh has two, she must not like them.  I know I didn't," she told  with a smirk.  </p>

<p>"Marriage is all about compromise," I responded looking over at her.   We held each other's gaze for a moment, and then broke out laughing.</p>

<p>"Do you have school tomorrow?" she asked once we had settled back  down.  "I don't even know what day it is."</p>

<p>"Tuesday, and yeah," I responded. "Why?"</p>

<p>"No reason," she said immediately shifting around on the bed.  "I've  been thinking about setting up a nap time schedule, just wanted to  know when to pencil you in."</p>

<p>A few moments after that I got up, telling her that I had left  something at the nurses' station and was going to get it.  I hadn't  left anything at the nurses station, I just didn't believe her and  was worried that something was going on I didn't know about.  I had  become a little obsessive about keeping Brooke well, it was very  important to me that she stay okay.  I found out that she was  scheduled for her first physical therapy session the next day and  that the doctors recommended family or friends be present.  </p>

<p>"Where is it?" she asked when I walked back into the room.</p>

<p>"Wh…in my bag," I responded quickly covering.  I reaching into the  small bag I had thrown across my shoulders I dug around trying to  find something I could pass off as actually having left at the  nurses' station.  I settled on a deck of playing cards Emroy had  given me.</p>

<p>"You don't match."</p>

<p>"What?" I asked looking at her perplexed.</p>

<p>"Your clothes, they don't match," she clarified waving her hand  around indicating my body.</p>

<p>"I knew it," I responded actually looking down for the first time,  making a face when I finally saw what I was wearing.  "I…" I started  trying and unable to find a suitable excuse for my attire.  "I  brought cards."</p>

<p>"What do you want to play?" As she asked this she started poking at  random buttons on the controller attached to her muttering to herself  when it wouldn't move the way she wanted.  I watched this for a  second smiling before walking over and offering to help.   Taking the  controller from her a pressed a blue button, which caused the bed to  start vibrating, and Brooke to grab the controller back before  pointing at me and saying `no more help'.</p>

<p>"How about strip poker?" I asked winking at her as I retook my seat.</p>

<p>"You'll have an unfair advantage, I'm only wearing one article of  clothing and it's already open at the back," she responded.</p>

<p>"Really?" I asked my eyes lightening up.  "Let's see," I continued  standing up and placing my hands on her side like I was going to turn  her over.</p>

<p>"Sam, I swear to god that if you try and violate my helpless ass,  when I get my cane I will gleefully use it beat you about the head."   This was said with her finger waving in my face menacingly.</p>

<p>"Who said anything about violating, I just wanted to look," I  responded smiling down at her before she ordered me to reseat myself.</p>

<p>"Aces are wild," I said a moment later pulling out a card and holding  it up for her to see.  She grabbed my hand and yanked it down so that  it came to rest on her stomach as she looked around the room  nervously.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," she breathed out softly.  "You asked a nurse to hold  these!?!"</p>

<p>"What's wrong with them," I inquired innocently.  "It's just the  Flintstone's."</p>

<p>"They did that in the cartoons," she responded pointing to Fred and  Wilma who were in a rather compromising position, as she tilted her  head to the side curiously.  "Is that even humanly possible?" she  continued squinting at the card in question.</p>

<p>"You tell me," I responded.  I still don't know why I said, I had  been trying to get the image of her and Josh out of my head for over  a year, and finally when I had managed to forget I had to go and  asked that.  </p>

<p>She looked at me questioningly for a moment, probably having just as  much trouble believing I had said it as I had.  "Not the way he did  it," she responded softly.  "I think you have to be pretty limber."</p>

<p>"You're a cheerleader," I pointed out.</p>

<p>"True, but he's not," she countered.  "You and I would probably have  more luck," she continued eyeing me momentarily before moving on  with,  "Are you going to finish dealing or what?"</p>
