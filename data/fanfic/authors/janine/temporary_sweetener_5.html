<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 4 -->

<p>Buffy awoke with a pained groan grabbing the side of her head and  wincing.  Being thrown against walls really did nothing to improve  her disposition upon waking up.  Seeing that it was dark outside she  glanced at her clock 7:30 pm, she and Cordelia had left at 10:00.   She'd been asleep all day.  She couldn't be sleeping in all day, she  had things to do, she had a sister to take care, and she had a  household to run and guest to entertain.  She felt more rested than  she had in probably like a year or something and decided to just  focus on that.</p>

<p>As she made her way down the stairs she could hear voices coming from  inside of the living room and slowed her step, listening to the sound  of her friend's voices, trying to let them wash over her.  Leaning  against the staircase she tilted her head to the side so that she  could see into the room yet remain unobserved.  Dawn seemed to be  acting out some sort of vignette, her back hunched over and her hand  moving in front of her face in a dramatic manner as she her mouth  parted and little sounds started to come out of her throat.  Her eyes  were twinkling and Buffy wished that she had a camera with her so  that she could keep that image with her for the rest of time.  So  that she could keep it in her pocket and take it out when the  darkness came and threatened to blind her.</p>

<p>And she looked at them all one by one and she saw Xander's excited  motions, and Anya's furrowed brow, and Willow's amused smile, and  Tara's serene visage.  And she saw Cordelia bathed in light watching  them all with a soft smile on her face, that would at times be  replaced by a smug grin, or an amused smirk, or an eyes twinkling  smile.  She heard the brunettes smooth voice echoing her in  mind "look harder", and she did.  And she felt, she felt something  inside when she watched the woman.  She felt something inside as she  traced the elegant lines of Cordelia's tanned skin with her eyes,  down her throat, across her shoulders, over her breasts, sliding  further down to her hips to long tapered legs.  She felt something  inside as she watched the brunette's lips curve and pout; she felt  the need to get some fresh air. </p>

<hr>

<p> Cordelia heard the back door close softly in a moment of relative  silence in the room and knew that the lady of the house had arisen  and snuck out. Mumbling something that was probably intelligible to  anyone in the room, the brunette stepped out secretly glad for the  distraction.  She liked the Scoobies well enough, and they were  nothing if not entertaining, but she was finding it increasingly hard  to keep her upper lip stiff as the day wore on.  It gave her a whole  new appreciation for what it was Buffy had been going through trying  to keep the truth hidden for so long, and strengthened her belief  that the blonde needed to tell them if she ever hoped to feel sane  again.</p>

<p>"Hiding again?" Cordelia asked settling herself on the steps of the  deck.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Buffy responded turning her head to the side so that  she could make Cordelia out.  She had slumped down in one of the lawn  chairs and was looking  at the stars when she heard the brunette come  out.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come in?" the brunette asked.  Everyone had been  badgering her all day about what had happened the night before and  she was sure it would have pleased the Scoobies to see that fearless  leader was up and about.</p>

<p>"I was busy," the Slayer responded her eyes still trained on the  brunette.</p>

<p>"What?" Cordelia asked standing up and moving towards Buffy.  She  couldn't see the Slayer's face and she couldn't talk to Buffy like  this without seeing her.  She'd miss something, and knowing both of  their luck it'd be something that shouldn't have been missed.  "You  have to practice being anti-social?"</p>

<p>"No," Buffy said following Cordelia with her eyes until the girl came  to rest in the chair beside her.  "I was looking."</p>

<p>"Looking?" Cordelia repeated leaning towards Buffy as if the answer  to her question were written on the blonde's face.  "Ah, looking,"  she continued a second later as the answer came to her.  Somebody was  actually following her advice.  How novel!  "What'd you see?"</p>

<p>"I saw them," Buffy said turning her head in the direction of the  house.  "I saw you," she continued turning her attention back to  Cordelia.  "And I thought that it looked nice in there."</p>

<p>Cordelia watched as a smile began to spread across Buffy's checks  after she finished speaking.  A shy one that caused her to dip her  head down and look off to the side shaking her head a little.   Cordelia could almost picture the inevitable blush across her  cheek's, and found herself thinking that she thought the entire  display was only marginally less cute that a sack of puppies.  It was  charming, and for a second it felt like three years before when the  sun always shone and nothing existed in the world that could hold  them down for the count.</p>

<p>"When I was there, watching you," Buffy started up again, her head  still tilted downwards but her voice strong, and carrying without a  falter, "I felt excited for the first time since coming back," she  continued glancing up at the brunette.  "I mean, something came over  me," she went on upon the seeing the other woman cock her head to the  side questioningly.  "Something warm…and I felt a genuine desire to  do something.  Not because I didn't know what else to do, but because  I wanted to do it."</p>

<p>"What did you want to do?" Cordelia asked unconsciously leaning  towards Buffy, her voice lowering intimately.  She knew that she  probably shouldn't have asked, that whatever it was Buffy had felt  was personal and probably a rather private desire, but she wanted to  know.  She tried to justify this need by telling herself that she  wanted Buffy to make a break through so that the Slayer would be well  on her way to being on her feet when it came time for them to face  down the beast again.  She kept telling herself that, but she knew  that it wasn't true.  The truth of the matter was that she just  wanted Buffy on her feet again, she wanted to see the blonde smile at  her before she left and mean it.  She wanted to look at the woman and  see that old mischievousness behind her eyes.  She wanted Buffy to be  better, and she wanted this because she just plain liked the girl.   And, she thought to herself, if you weren't such a stubborn jackass  you'd just admit it.</p>

<p>"What happened last night," Buffy began carefully.  "You're sure that  wasn't the vision you had?"</p>

<p>"Positive," Cordelia responded equally as carefully.  "Same bat time,  wrong bat channel."</p>

<p>"So that means you've gotta be around here at least another night,"  the Slayer stated though it came out sounding more like a question.</p>

<p>"Another.  A couple other.  Yeah," Cordelia responded looking at  Buffy carefully.  The woman wasn't doing much to inspire her  confidence.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded as spoke, slowly easing herself out of her chair as the  brunette finished up.  "The great thing about residing at rock  bottom," the blonde began taking a step towards the ex- cheerleader, "is that you've got no place left to fall," she went on,  watching Cordelia watch her.  "So, when I started to feel this… thing," she breathed out, her voice no more than a soft rasp.  "I  just decided to roll with it."</p>

<p>"Roll with what?" Cordelia asked forcing herself to ignore the  nervous energy that began to course through her body as Buffy closed  the last of the distance between them.</p>

<p>"Wanting to do this," Buffy responded and with that she leaned down  closing the remaining distance between them as she pressed her lips  against Cordelia's lightly, her hand coming to rest on the brunette's  face, her thumb stroking her cheek lightly.  She had felt Cordelia  tense at the first touch of their lips, but almost as soon as she had  become aware of the reaction it was gone and the brunette was  relaxing and opening her mouth to the Slayer.</p>

<p>"Oh," Cordelia breathed out as Buffy leaned back breaking the contact  between their lips, her eyes searching the blonde's face though for  what she wasn't certain.  "I see."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy stood there looking down at Cordelia and her virtual non- reaction then closed her eyes.  "And now that the gates have been  opened, other emotions are starting to surface, like guilt and  mortification," she muttered softly taking a step back from Cordelia  while mentally berating herself for the stupidity of her previous  action.  She always had to push it didn't she.  It wasn't enough that  she just actually wanted to do something, she had to be a jackass and  actually do something about it.  "And the instinct to flee," she  continued turning around and heading for the house.  How was she  suppose to look this woman in the eye for the rest of her visit?   They were suppose to face death together now?</p>

<p>"Buffy," Cordelia called out seeing the woman turn to run again.  "I  wasn't, I'm not…" she continued standing up and walking over to the  Slayer, "upset."  Coming to a stop directly in front of the blonde  she dipped her head down slightly before continuing.   "More knocked  completely off my feet.  I…I just haven't been kissed for longer than  my dignity allows me to admit."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" Buffy asked, her gaze trained on Cordelia's  neck not willing to look the girl in the face yet.  She'd been so  numb since coming back and for the first time since that god awful  night she was feeling something, feeling human for the first time in  weeks and she was terrified at the thought that Cordelia might take  the warmth away.</p>

<p>Cordelia watched the woman in front of her for long moments trying to  come up with a response to her question.  What was she saying?  How  could she tell Buffy when she didn't even know herself.  She shook  her head as the answer came to her, it's simplicity amusing her  slightly.  She couldn't tell Buffy anything, so she'd so what she had  been trying to get Buffy to all along.  She'd feel.  So smiling ever  so slightly Cordelia leaned forward pressing her lips against Buffy  as her hands came to rest on the side of the blonde's face.</p>

<p>And soon they were leaning into each other, their bodies pressed  against each other tightly as they strained to increase the contact  between them.  Their hands roaming each other bodies and tangling in  each other's hair as they sought to consume each other, overcome by a  desperate hunger.  And as they stayed together, in that warm embrace,  Cordelia wasn't thinking about whether the next vision she received  was going to knock her out or praying that it wouldn't be a child  that she'd see.  She wasn't thinking about the isolation she felt as  a result of knowing what other people chose not to know.  And she  wasn't thinking about the fact that this is the first moment in  longer than she could remember where she hadn't been a little  afraid.  And as their tongues danced with each other in that age old  ballet, Buffy wasn't thinking about how cold it was, or how  everything seemed so dull and muted, and she wasn't thinking about  how she has to smile when she really just wanted to collapse.  All  she that she was aware of was that for the first time since coming  back she was glad to be exactly where she was.</p>
