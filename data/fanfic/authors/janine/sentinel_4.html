<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 4 -->

<p><i>*Note* Brooke's POV</i></p>

<p> I think the best thing about the hospital were the bendy straws.  I'd  always had this weird love the bendy straw and it's many positions.   Dad used to say that could play with one for ten or fifteen minutes,  which was like a lifetime for me, or so I'm told.  </p>

<p>I had been aware of Sam's head on my shoulder for quite some time,  but I hadn't realized she was asleep until I finished my Ginger Ale  and put the bendy straw away.  Turning my head to the side I looked  down and saw her hair splayed out over my shoulder, her breath steady  and slow.  Her lips were curled slightly and her eyes darted around  behind her eyelids.  I imagined that she was dreaming about ending  world hunger, or one day being the reporter to break the new  Watergate.  It brought a smile to my face, and I sighed happily.</p>

<p>Actually, I was quite satisfied to see that she had fallen asleep.   Ever since I had woken up she had looked exhausted, even after mom  and dad started forcing her to go home at night.  She had earned the  nap, and I at least hoped that my shoulder was more comfortable than  the floor, although I somehow doubted it looking at the angle she was  resting at and how her back bent over.</p>

<p>The nurses and doctors had told me about Sam during the day while she  was away at school.  Commenting with something close to awe on her  dedication to me, on her stoic vigil over me.  The way they described  it she sounded like a war hero, awake twenty-four hours, on constant  guard, no food, no light.  My guardian angel, keeper of my heart.</p>

<p>I remember waking up feeling safe, feeling loved.  After getting run  over by ones former best friend, safe and loved isn't exactly what I  would have expected to wake up feeling, but I did, and I know it was  because of her.  Because somehow, someway I knew she was here all  that time, protecting me from unknown dangers.</p>

<p>I reached over brushing a strand of hair out of her face and she made  a small sound and nestled further into my shoulder.  Her lips were  pressed against my neck and I could feel her soft breaths on my  skin.  I felt so close to her and so far away at the same time.  I  wanted her beside me, and quite selfishly I contemplated waking her  up.  If I had asked her to join me in the bed, to leave her trusty  chair behind I know that she would have, but I didn't.  Instead I  turned my head so that I could just make out the outline of her face  and I studied her as she slept.</p>

<p>I had noticed it before, but only came to really appreciate the  flawlessness of Sam's skin in that room.  Her skin was soft and  inviting, as beautiful to the touch as to the eye.  I know because on  more than one occasion I find myself absently stroking her cheek.   Sometimes she would mumble something leaning into me, other times she  would move her head into my hand, and sometimes (my personal  favorite) her lips would just curl up into an exquisite little smile.</p>

<p>"What the…!?!" </p>

<p>She mumbled this after she suddenly jerked awake, her head flying off  of my shoulder like someone had set fire to her hair.  She was  looking around anxiously as if trying to figure out where she was and  how she got there.</p>

<p>"You fell asleep," I said watching as she stretched her neck from  side to side grimacing slightly as her muscles pulled.  "You looked  like you needed it."</p>

<p>"You were my pillow?" she asked as she rotated her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Were you comfortable?" she asked smiling impishly.</p>

<p>"I'd like to think so," I responded holding out my hand.  She reached  out and grasped it.  "Let me help."</p>

<p>"With what?" she asked rather distractedly.  She seemed to be  studying my hand though I have no idea what could have held her  attention so raptly.</p>

<p>"Your shoulders.  I give good massages," I responded rubbing her  finger with mine to draw her attention back towards me.</p>

<p>"You're in the hospital," was her response.  She said it with such  authority and finality that I paused for a moment to see if I had  missed something, I don't think that I did.</p>

<p>"So?" was my artful response.  "I'm feeling better, I want to do  something.  I want to give you a massage."</p>

<p>"You'll have to sit up?  What about that opened back robe of yours?"  she asked, although as she continued to rotate her neck painfully, I  could see the idea growing on her.</p>

<p>"First of all, it's not a robe, it's a dressing gown," I replied  shifting myself into a sitting position.  "And secondly, you'll be  sitting in front of me so it doesn't really matter," I continued.</p>

<p>She stood up placing her hands on my shoulders pushing me back down.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't sit up."  She was looking at my leg, which didn't hurt  but looked like it should.  </p>

<p>"I want…"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," she interjected looking a little annoyed.  I found  it charming.  "You're a real pain once you've got an idea in your  head, you know?" she asked stepping back a look of concentration  coming over her face.</p>

<p>"I want…"</p>

<p>"I said I know," she interrupted again.  "How about I just lie on the  bed?" she asked surveying the situation with an architect's eye.  "I  should be able to fit in between your legs."</p>

<p>"Works for me," was all I said, slightly distracted in a rather  pleasant way by Sam talking about getting between my legs.</p>

<p>"Okay, but you have to promise to drop this whole thing if I try and  it hurts you."  I nodded and she stepped forward, carefully  maneuvering herself in between my legs.</p>

<p>"You're nap would have been a lot more comfortable like this," I said  as I brought my hands up to her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Probably," was her non-committal response.  I smiled.</p>

<p>"Next time you get tired," I continued starting to press down on her  muscles, releasing a moan from deep within her throat.  "Let me know  will you.  There's plenty of room up here…as you now see," I went on  as I rubbed her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Brooke," she said very slowly, her voice rumbling.  I could tell she  was smiling.  "Are you telling me that I can sleep with you?"</p>

<p>"If you want to," I responded.  "Do you have anything on under this?"  I asked fingering the material of her shirt.</p>

<p>"Tank top," was all she said.</p>

<p>"Take it off," was my equally short reply.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It'll be easier for me to give you a massage if I'm touching your  skin," I told her as my hands came to rest on her hips.  </p>

<p>"This is beginning to feel like a bad porn movie," she said as she  turned around shooting me a dubious look.  It was funny because I had  been telling her the truth.  The massage would be far more effective  if I had better access to her.</p>

<p>"There are bad ones?" I asked raising my eyebrow in surprise. She  turned around at that one looking at me keenly before reaching for  the bottom of her shirt and pulling it over her head.</p>

<p>"Better?" she asked settling back against me.</p>

<p>"Most definitely.  Prepare to fly with the birds," I said placing my  hands on her shoulders once more beginning to rub them.  "Really, I  know what I'm doing," I told her trying to get her to relax.  "Dad  took me to Sweden once, and I had this au par who used to be  a `masseuse'.  She was supposed to be teaching about the formation of  the American constitution, but she didn't seem to know a lot about  that.  Strange that the Swedish school system didn't spend more time  on it really.  Anyway, she ended up teaching me different massage  techniques, I guess hoping that if I didn't make it as a historian, I  could at least make a little money on the streets. So you, really  you're in good hands."  I felt her shoulders shake as she laughed  silently and I smiled to myself.</p>

<p>"Do you really expect me to believe that you learned how to give  massages from an old Swedish streetwalker who wanted a protégé?" she  asked turning around.</p>

<p>"Yes," was all I said in response.  "Now turn around and let me earn  my paycheck."</p>

<p>As I manipulated her muscles I felt her body begin to relax, and her  head dropped forward.  Every once in a while she would release a tiny  sound, or her body would move sensuously delighting in it's new  slackness.  We didn't talk as I massaged her shoulders and she made  no comment when I stopped digging into her muscles and started to  gently trail my hands over her skin.  </p>

<p>"Brooke," she said reaching up and capturing my hands, snapping me  out of whatever haze I had gone into.  "This is the best I've felt it  days."</p>

<p>"Good," I said leaning forward wrapping my arms around her in a  momentary hug.  She turned around and smiled at me once I leaned back  against my pillows releasing her.  Then she carefully got off of the  bed so that she was standing beside me once more.</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?" she asked.  The moment she said it her stomach  rumbled and my eyes focused on her slightly exposed abdomen.</p>

<p>"I could eat," I responded.</p>

<p>"I'll be right back."</p>
