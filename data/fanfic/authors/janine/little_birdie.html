<p>Buffy stalked
into the café and looked around. Willow wasn't there. She sighed and ran a
hand through her hair straightening it out. She wasn't sure whether she was
glad Willow hadn't arrived yet so that she could gather her wits, or whether
she was sad that she would have to wait to see her friend. Glancing around
the café she spotted an empty booth behind a group of teens and took a seat.
Whether she liked it or not it she was waiting.</p>

<p>She had just gotten
through with patrol and had come straight to the café. She and Willow had
agreed to meet here when she was done. It wasn't for any special reason,
they just both wanted to get out of the dorm room for a reason that didn't
involve demons and death. She was glad that they had agreed to meet because
the slaying that hadn't been so great-or perhaps it had been too good-and
she was really looking forward to seeing Willow and just doing something
normal. Something relaxing. Nothing could put her in a better mood faster
than being with Willow.</p>

<p>One of the voices at the table behind her caught
her attention. She recognized the voice. It was smoky, and deep but
distinctly feminine. Then after a moment she was able to place it , it
belonged to a girl that she had two classes with.Claire. They were in
psychology and geography together. Buffy had never really talked to her, but
her voice was original and made her stand out so the Slayer had noticed
her.</p>

<p>Even though she recognized the voice, Buffy wasn't notoriously
concerned with the conversation taking place behind her and kept her eyes on
the door, waiting for Willow. It wasn't until she heard her name mentioned
at the table behind her that started to listen to what they were
saying.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers?" It was Claire who asked that. She seemed
slightly amused. Buffy wasn't sure how she felt about that.</p>

<p>"Yeah,
she's a hottie," a male voice responded. "A stone cold fox," he continued.
Buffy could almost hear the smile in his voice. She knew that she should be
upset about being objectified, that's what any good feminist would feel, but
she didn't really mind. Being called a stone cold fox wasn't so
bad.</p>

<p>"You're way off man," another voice responded. This one was male
too. "That girl's.she's like this deep well.you could fall into her," he
 continued.</p>

<p>"Who's Buffy Summers? Is she a model? I've never heard of
her.is she that new girl of Party of Five?" This time the voice was female,
and very valley girl. She reminded Buffy of Cordelia. Although she would
never admit it to anyone Buffy had to admit that she missed Cordelia a
little bit. Despite that fact that she could be an absolute bitch when she
wanted to be, there was something charming about the brunette. It was kind
of irritating.</p>

<p>"Buffy is not the new girl on Party of Five," Claire
responded. The tone of her voice was hilarious and Buffy wished that she
could see her face. "She's that blonde chick who's in 'the demon bitch
monster from hells' class with us."</p>

<p>"This is California, do you know
how many blonde chicks there are around here?" the other female asked. "This
table is ¾ blond."</p>

<p>"Is that your way of telling me you want me to be more
specific?" Claire asked. Buffy could hear the two males
snicker.</p>

<p>"Yes," the other female responded in a snippy
tone.</p>

<p>"Buffy is the blond chick who's permanently attached to the side of
that red-headed chick," Claire responded. Buffy arched her eyebrow at the
 description. That was a first.</p>

<p>"Oohhhhhh," the other female said in a
knowing tone. Buffy was tempted to turn around, what the hell was 'oohhhhhh'
suppose to mean?</p>

<p>"What the hell is that suppose to mean?" the first male
Buffy had heard speak asked. &lt;Right on brother&gt;, Buffy thought to
herself.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Claire responded. "We just don't think that you're
her type," she continued. &lt;Why not?&gt;, Buffy thought to
herself.</p>

<p>"Why not?" the guy asked in a kind of pathetic
tone.</p>

<p>"Well first of all, have you seen her shoes? The girl has got
taste," the unknown female responded.</p>

<p>"Which means that she'd never
go out with you," Claire finished. Despite herself Buffy found that slightly
amusing.and she did have good shoes.</p>

<p>"What's the second reason?" the
second guy asked.</p>

<p>"The girl's an LSL," Claire responded in an exasperated
tone. "It's so obvious." &lt;A what?&gt;, Buffy thought to herself. She
hated acronyms, she really did. First it was her mother with that stupid
MOO, and now this. What the hell was an LSL?</p>

<p>"Lip-Stick Lesbian," the
other girl responded happily. "Your sister's good looking though, maybe you
could introduce them," she continued laughing at her own wit.</p>

<p>Time
seemed to slow down for Buffy after the acronym was explained. Lip-Stick
Lesbian. Buffy shock her head in confusion. Why would they think that she
was gay? There was nothing wrong with it, she just didn't understand why
they thought that she was. &lt;Do I give off a gay vibe?&gt; she wondered.
Faith had always teased her about that.</p>

<p>"She is not," the first guy
responded. "You're just jealous," he stated.</p>

<p>"Yeah, of the red-head," the
first girl responded. "What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Willow," Claire responded. "You
could always fight for the fair Ms. Summer's affections, but if you ask me,
she could take you."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Jeff, Annie could definitely kick your
scrawny ass," the other girl added.</p>

<p>"Shut up Abbie," Jeff, the first
guy, responded.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor baby," Claire responded. "I'm sure there are a
lot of pretty girls out there just dying to date you, who wouldn't rather do
your sister."</p>

<p>"Are you sure about her?" the second guy
asked.</p>

<p>"T.J, I'm telling you this girl is as queer as black sunshine,"
Abbie responded. "But even if she did swing both ways, I doubt you or anyone
else would have a chance with her."</p>

<p>"Why?" Jeff asked. He sounded
like a two year old who had been told he couldn't have a cookie.</p>

<p>"She
and the red-head."</p>

<p>"Willow."</p>

<p>"Yeah, whatever. Like I was saying,
they seem really tight. Dopey Bambi eyes and shit," Abbie said. "I bet
they're like in love or something."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Buffy and Willow sitting in a
tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g." Claire sing-songed.</p>

<p>"Hey, that's it!" T.J said
as if he had just discovered a cure for cancer.</p>

<p>"That's what?" Claire
asked.</p>

<p>"That's why they're always holding hands, and like skipping down
the road together and shit," he responded.</p>

<p>Buffy was sure that they
continued to talk about her and Willow after that but she stopped paying
attention to what they were saying after that. They thought that she was
gay.with Willow. They thought that she and Willow were being gay together.
That was totally, way, way, way, utterly, completely.not so off base, Buffy
admitted. They weren't together like that, but Buffy had thought about what
it would be like if they were, and they were close. 'I bet they're like in
love or something' Abbie had said. Buffy's mind kept repeating that sentence
over and over again in her head like the proverbial broken record. They
loved each other, that much Buffy knew for they had told each. She just
hadn't realized that it was so obvious to those around them.</p>

<p>Buffy
frowned and played with the ring on her thumb. She wasn't really upset about
what they had been saying about her, after all they hadn't said anything
mean or even judgmental. She supposed that she would have been upset about
though if it wasn't for the fact that they right about her feeling for
Willow. She wouldn't go as far as to call herself a lip-stick lesbian or
queer as black sunshine, but she definitely had more than friendly feelings
for her best friend that were very gay in origin.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Willow walked
into the café and looked around. At first she couldn't see Buffy because a
large crowd was getting up and blocking Buffy from her view, but once they
started to move towards the door she spotted her friend. Willow recognized
two of the people in the crowd from her psychology class. She hadn't really
spoken to them, and only knew one of their names, but they seemed like
decent individuals. As they passed each other the group gave Willow an odd
look before moving by her and out the door. Willow stopped and watched them
leave wondering what the 'children of the corn' look was for. Shrugging she
turned back around and headed for the booth Buffy was in. The Slayer didn't
seem to have spotted her yet.</p>

<p>Willow sat down opposite Buffy and still
the Slayer didn't look at her. It was as if she didn't even know she was
there. She was that lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Willow said softly placing
her hand over her friends.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes immediately shot up to hers. The
Slayer seemed surprised, distracted, and a little bit unsettled. Willow's
brows drew together in concern, something wasn't right here.</p>

<p>"Are you
okay?" Willow asked looked at Buffy critically. "You look kind of.kind of
weird."</p>

<p>"I'm not weird," Buffy said drawing her hands away from
underneath Willow's. "I'm perfectly normal. Not at all like Revlon, or black
sunshine. Perfectly normal."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean.I know you're normal,"
Willow responded quickly in reaction to Buffy's reaction. "You're not weird,
you're great.normal and great. You're just a little.pale," Willow said
finally settling on an adjective.</p>

<p>"Pale?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Just a
little," Willow responded. "What's wrong Buffy?"</p>

<p>Buffy didn't respond
right away, instead she kind of turned her head to the side to look behind
her before turning back to Willow. They were gone.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of
here," Buffy said suddenly.</p>

<p>"What? Why?" Willow asked startled. "I just
got here."</p>

<p>"And am glad that you did. Thrilled really, ecstatic," Buffy
responded. "But we should leave. Yeah, we should definitely
leave."</p>

<p>"Why?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Why can't we just go?" Buffy asked
turning to look at Willow sharply. She regretted it the moment she said it
and lowered her gaze. Finally she looked back up to meet Willow's hurt gaze
and sighed. "I'm sorry Will," she said softly reaching out to take Willow's
hand. "I didn't mean to go all 'grrr' at you," she continued. "I just.this
place is giving me the wiggins right now. It'd be better for my nerves, not
to mention my mood if we shut her down."</p>

<p>"If you want to shut, then
we'll shut," Willow responded squeezing Buffy's hand. "But if you think that
we're not going to talk about this later, then you are wrong, wrong, wrong,
lady."</p>

<p>"Consider me properly chastised," Buffy responded with her most
charming grin.</p>

<p>"Good," Willow responded as they headed out of the
café. "Now you better continue to behave, or I'll have to spank
you."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped walking.</p>

<p>"Will," she said in what she hoped
was a normal voice. "You've spent way to much time around
Xander."</p>

<p>Willow smiled that sweet, lovely smile that Buffy loved so much
and continued
walking.</p>

<p>Buffy spent most of the
walk back to their dorm dividing her attention between telling Willow about
patrol and thinking about what she had overheard in the café. She knew that
Willow wanted to know why she was acting so weird in the café, but she
seriously couldn't see what good it would do to tell her she had heard. It
would only upset her friend and Buffy didn't want to do that. Not the
mention that Willow might wonder why her reaction to their "gossip" was so
extreme. If that happened there was no way Buffy could explain it to her.
She certainly wasn't going to tell Willow that there was more than a strong
possibility that she was in love with her, "that way". But, if she didn't
explain her reaction Willow might think that she was lying (which she would
be but that was besides the point).</p>

<p>As they entered the campus
grounds Willow linked her arms through Buffy's. Buffy looked over at her and
was with a greeted with a smile that was impossible to resist. She smiled
back and their gazes held for a moment before finally Buffy turned away and
returned her attention to the path.</p>

<p>No, she decided, she wasn't going to
tell Willow what happened in the café. Hearing it had already made her
paranoid, and she didn't want to make Willow all self-conscious about the
way they acted around each other. Buffy enjoyed the closeness between them,
it was something special and rare, and she didn't want to jeopardize that.
Maybe the desire to keep what she had heard a secret was a selfish attempt
to make sure that things wouldn't change between them, and if it was then
she was sorry in advance for any trouble it might cause, but she wasn't a
saint, she was a living, breathing, human being with feeling and desires,
and even if keeping the secret was the wrong thing to do, it was the only
thing that she could do. There wasn't much that she had in this world to
look forward to, when your whole life is dedicated to fighting demons goals
are kind of a non-issue, but she did have moments like this with Willow,
where it was just them, alone, and the world around them belonged only to
them, and only to the moment, and she cherished them. They nourished her,
and strengthened her, and she needed them. Maybe it was selfish, but it was
the only thing she could
do.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>It
took Willow precisely two minutes and thirty-three seconds at start
 questioning Buffy about the café once they arrived back at their room.
 Buffy smiled even though she was dreading this conversation, it was classic
 Willow.</p>

<p>"So what happened at the café?" Willow asked sitting down her
bed.</p>

<p>"At the café?" Buffy asked stalling for time. She needed to think.
"At the café I took a nap-a."</p>

<p>Willow smiled but wasn't going to let
her off the hook.</p>

<p>"You're not going to jokey rhyme your way out of this
one," Willow said watching as Buffy moved over to take a seat on her
bed.</p>

<p>"Will, it was nothing really," Buffy said lying down on her back.
She couldn't lie if she was looking at Willow's face. "I think I must have
 gotten hit on the head harder than I thought."</p>

<p>"And that's 'nothing
really'?" Willow asked looking at Buffy critically.</p>

<p>"Hey, it's not like
I'm 'Concentration-Girl' even on my best days," Buffy
 responded.</p>

<p>"That's true," Willow responded. Buffy looked over at her.
"Hey, you're the one that said it."</p>

<p>"So I did," Buffy admitted. It's
not like she was even really upset.</p>

<p>"How's your head now," Willow asked
getting up and walking over to Buffy's bed. "I could go get you some ice, or
a cold compress if you want," the hacker continued brushing a strand of hair
out of Buffy's face. Buffy sighed at the gentle touch.</p>

<p>"No, it's
alright," the Slayer responded. "I won't even feel it in couple
 hours."</p>

<p>"You know if you could bottle that Slayer recuperation
secret, you could be a billionaire," Willow said sitting down on the side of
Buffy's bed beside her.</p>

<p>"But if I did that mom wouldn't have the fun
of trying to scrap together enough money to pay for the expensive post
secondary education that's not going to be of any use to me anyway," Buffy
responded in a comically jaded way that only she could generate.</p>

<p>"I
think that she'd forgive you," Willow said smiling. "Are you sure that you
don't want anything?" Willow asked looking down at Buffy with concerned
 eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Buffy said smiling despite herself. Willow was to
good to her. "I don't know what I did to deserve a friend like you, but I'm
glad that I did whatever it was," Buffy continued before she was even aware
that the words were coming out of her mouth. That's the way it is when your
heart has something to say, no matter how much you try to suppress it, it
always bubbles to the surface-usually when you would rather it
didn't.</p>

<p>Willow looked down at her and just held her gaze. Then the hacker
smiled and bent down kissing Buffy on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was
I'm glad you did it to," she responded finally. "Now go to
 sleep."</p>

<p>"I'm not tired," Buffy said smiling. She was suddenly feeling
very, very good. Maybe even giddy.</p>

<p>"Yes you are," Willow said moving
back over to her bed. "And so am I. So please to go to sleep.for me?" Willow
continued.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're tired," Buffy said yawning. She didn't want
to keep Willow awake.</p>

<p>"I am," Willow said knowing that Buffy would
never go to sleep simply for her own good.</p>

<p>"Okay then," Buffy said
turning out her light.</p>

<p>"Right," Willow said turning out
hers.</p>

<p>"Goodnight Will," Buffy said a moment later.</p>

<p>"Night, Buff,"
Willow responded.</p>

<p>"Sweet dreams," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Don't let the bed
bugs bite," Willow responded closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sandman give her a
dream," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Willow said in a warning
tone.</p>

<p>"Sleep, right.I'm on it," Buffy said closing her
eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy sat on Giles' couch staring into the
fireplace. She could hear Spike rummaging around in kitchen no doubt doing
something that she didn't want to know about. Giles had left a few minutes
earlier to go grocery shopping meaning that she was alone with Spike until
the G-man got back or Willow arrived. Buffy turned her head to the side when
she heard Spike coming out of the kitchen. He was holding a mug in one hand
and some Wheat-a-bix in the other. Buffy frowned as he started to break the
wheat into the mug and made a face. There was only one word to describe what
she was feeling and that word was "ewwww!"</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"
Buffy asked even though she didn't rally want to know.</p>

<p>"Adds texture,"
Spike responded referring to the wheat. "High in fiber too, makes Spike a
strong boy."</p>

<p>"Just when I thought that you couldn't possibly get any more
disgusting," Buffy responded turning away as he lifted the mug to his
lips.</p>

<p>"Where's Oak?" Spike asked sitting down in the chair opposite
Buffy. Buffy glared at him.</p>

<p>"Willow," she said carefully annunciating
the word, "has a class and will be coming around later."</p>

<p>"Turn on the
Tele will you," Spike said turning away from her.</p>

<p>"Turn it on yourself,"
Buffy responded picking at one of her nails.</p>

<p>"I'm in the middle of my
bloody lunch right now woman," Spike responded. Buffy looked over at him
with a disgusted look on her face.</p>

<p>"You're dead, it's not like you've got
anything better to do," Buffy responded. "Turn on the damn 'Tele' yourself,"
she continued mocking his accent.</p>

<p>"You owe me," he said pointing an
accusatory finger in her face.</p>

<p>"I what?" Buffy asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>"I've still got Buffy taste in my mouth," he responded.
"Thinking about it gives me the willies."</p>

<p>"Drop dead," Buffy said
shooting him an utterly corrosive look.</p>

<p>"Been there, done that," Spike
responded.</p>

<p>"Do you want a return ticket?" Buffy asked
snidely.</p>

<p>"You must be an absolute joy to live with," Spike responded.
"You and Malibu Maple must have fun all day long."</p>

<p>"Shut up Spike,"
Buffy said staring at him. "You may be impotent and pathetic now, but if you
make one more tree joke I'm going to make you a dust buster happy
meal."</p>

<p>"Somebody's sensitive," Spike said backing off the Willow topic
for the moment. "Maybe you need more fiber in your diet," he suggested
holding his mug out to her.</p>

<p>"Ewww," Buffy responded turning away from
him.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a while after that. Buffy was looking at the
door hoping for someone, anyone, to get back, and Spike was slurping up his
blood making 'ohhh ahhh' sounds and rubbing his stomach.</p>

<p>After a
while the silence started to get to Buffy and she spoke up.</p>

<p>"You've gone
for almost three weeks without making any Angel jokes," she started. "Are
you feeling alright? Are you sick?" she asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"I can't eat, I
can't fight, and I can't even drink my bloody.blood, in peace. Yeah, I'm
fricking fantastic," Spike responded sarcastically. "Besides I get a better
reaction from the red-head jokes."</p>

<p>"Better reaction?" Buffy
asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Spike responded happily. "When I mention Fang-boy you just
get all bitchy, but when it comes Cedar your face turns all sorts of nifty
colours."</p>

<p>"My face is not hyper-colour," Buffy muttered under her breath.
"Like you should talk bleached boy," she continued slouching down into the
chair.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Spike said hearing the 'bleached boy' comment. "Like yours
is natural."</p>

<p>"Kiss my ass," Buffy shot back at him.</p>

<p>"Not even
if you pounced on me like a rabid dog.again," Spike responded making a face.
"Besides, would you rather Willow do it," he said tauntingly.</p>

<p>Buffy
looked over and glared at him. Did everybody know how she was
 feeling?</p>

<p>"Oh, did Spike hit a nerve," the vampire said smiling. "Did
I hurt the little Slayers feelings?" he asked. Buffy didn't respond. "Come
on," Spike said. "Did I? Did I hurt your feelings? Please tell me I did," he
 continued gleefully.</p>

<p>"Get out!" Buffy said standing up.</p>

<p>"It's
the middle of the afternoon," Spike said not moving. "It's sunny out
 there!"</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy said smiling. "Now get out!"</p>

<p>"You
can't do that," Spike said standing up and backing away from. "Giles won't
let you. You need me," he continued, although the last part sounded more
hopeful than anything else.</p>

<p>"Giles, isn't here," Buffy responded. "And
you don't have anything I need."</p>

<p>"Come on now," Spike said starting to
get a little worried. Buffy looked like she was enjoying herself. "Can't we
all just.get along?"</p>

<p>"Uh, let me think about that," Buffy responded
tilting her head up to the ceiling. "No."</p>

<p>"Geesh," Spike said. "And I
thought that love was suppose to make all you humans nice, and
friendly."</p>

<p>"I am not in love," Buffy said glaring at him.</p>

<p>"Keep
telling yourself that," Spike said sitting back down. He didn't feel that
his life was in immediate danger anymore.</p>

<p>"You can't just say 'keep
telling yourself that' and sit down," Buffy responded. "What the hell is
that suppose to mean? Who am I supposedly in love
with?"</p>

<p>"Willow."</p>

<p>"Willow?"</p>

<p>"Willow," Spike
confirmed.</p>

<p>"You.you are so, so, so.so, very, very.crazy, nuts, insane.and
if I do say so myself, not very nice," Buffy responded haltingly. She didn't
really know what the hell she was saying, just that what Spike had said had
felt true to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, why don't you just hump her leg and get it
over with already," Spike said making a face. "All that hand holding, and 'I
love you', no, 'I love you', blah, blah, blah, is making me sick. Just shag
already and shut up about it."</p>

<p>"I do not want to hump Willow's leg!"
Buffy said emphatically. She could not believe that she was having this
conversation with Spike. And the fact that he right just pissed her off to
no end.</p>

<p>"Do to," Spike responded.</p>

<p>"Do not," Buffy
said.</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Not."</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Not."</p>

<p>"Do."</p>

<p>"Not."</p>

<p>And
so it continued, and continued, and continued, for a long, long
time.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow
practically ran over to Giles' house after her last class had finished.
Buffy had been acting odd all morning, not to mention the fact that she had
being acting beyond strange the night before. Buffy and strange kind of went
together, but she was acting strange even for her. Also, if she was going to
be completely honest she just wanted to see her friend. She was always
happiest when she and Buffy were around each other, when they were together
it was like the sky was bluer than normal, and the grass was greener than
normal, and everything was beautiful and beauty was everywhere.</p>

<p>As
she approached the door she could hear voices yelling inside. One of the
 voices was Buffy's, she was sure of that, and the other one sounded a lot
 like Spike. As she got closer to the door then voices got louder, but she
 still couldn't hear what they were saying. Fearing that someone was about
 to get staked, Willow quickly opened the door and went in. Spike seemed to
 be yelling "do" and Buffy was countering with "not".</p>

<p>"Do not what?"
Willow asked walking into the living room.</p>

<p>Buffy turned around at the
sound of Willows voice.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Buffy answered quickly.</p>

<p>"I
don't think so," Spike said still in his yelling voice. "She's bloody in
 lo." he stopped speaking when a piece of wood went flying by his
face.</p>

<p>"You tried to stake me!" he yelled pointing at Buffy. "She tried to
stake me!" he said again turning to look at Willow as if she was going to
back him up.</p>

<p>"If I tried to stake you, you'd be dust," Buffy
responded cockily.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" Willow asked watching the
interaction between the two of them in absolute bewilderment.</p>

<p>Buffy
continued to stare at Spike.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Buffy said holding the vampires
gaze.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Spike said sullenly a moment later. "Except that I hate
her," he said giving Buffy the evil eye.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked in mock
horror. "You.you don't like me? Oh my god, however shall I find the courage
go on?" she continued in the same tone.</p>

<p>"I'm going to watch Passions,"
Spike grumbled walking away. "Grace senses evil in Harmony," he continued
heading into one of the back rooms.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" Willow
asked walking over to Buffy.</p>

<p>"Spike and I.had a difference of opinion,"
Buffy responded hoping that Willow would leave it at that.</p>

<p>"About
what?" Willow asked following Buffy over to the couch to sit down.</p>

<p>"He
wanted me to turn on the TV and I didn't want to turn on the TV, so I told
him to turn on the damn TV himself, but he didn't like that suggestion, so I
told him to drop dead, and he said that he already had," Buffy paused to
take a breath then continued. "So I asked him if he wanted a return ticket,
and he said that I must be a joy to live with, and."</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Willow
asked stopping Buffy's story.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said turning to face her
friend.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that I asked," Willow responded.</p>

<p>"Hey, we all
make mistakes," Buffy said smiling.</p>

<p>"How's your head?" Willow asked.
Buffy had told her in the morning that it was fine, but she had still seemed
distracted in psychology class.</p>

<p>"In tact and working as well as it ever
it did.which maybe isn't saying much," Buffy responded. "How was class?" she
asked immediately afterwards wanting to avoid any conversation about
her.</p>

<p>Willow smiled and started telling her about what had happened during
her last class. Buffy leaned back, all was right with the
world.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy
was out patrolling and Willow had been in the library studying, but she was
finished with that and was bored so she decided to go patrol with Buffy.
Buffy was always around the sports stadium around this time so Willow
figured that she would be able to find her pretty easily. As long as she was
able to manage avoiding being killed, she was sitting pretty. As she headed
across the campus she found her thoughts drifting towards the very person
she was seeking out. Buffy. Actually, she found that her thoughts drifted to
Buffy quite a bit, in fact more than quite a bit. She was.she was smitten,
she had to admit it.</p>

<p>It had all started with that doppelganger of hers.
Bad, vamp, shanky, Willow who went around licking girls necks and trying to
'become one' with them. She had been blissfully unaware of the 'kind of gay'
in her until that incident. There was this unapologetic, charged, free
sexuality about her double, and even if you knew that she would snap your
neck as soon as kiss you, you were drawn to her. Being around her, being hit
on by her, and for a while even pretending to be her awakened something in
Willow, and she knew that it wasn't ever going to go to sleep again. She
knew now that she was no longer 'kind of', she just was. Being with Oz had
given her a kind of respite from thinking about it. So what if she watched
Law and Order because she thought that Carmichael was sexy? She had a
boyfriend that she genuinely cared about, who adored her, so it was a moot
point. But now, now she didn't have that boyfriend and the point wasn't so
moot anymore.</p>

<p>Willow was so lost in her thoughts that she didn't see the
girl walking opposite her on the path until the crashed into each
other.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Willow said putting her hands out in a gesture of peace.
"Are you alright?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm fine," the girl said her head was still
facing away from Willow but the hacker recognized her voice. Only one person
she knew had the smoky voice, it was Claire from her psyche class.</p>

<p>"I
wasn't paying attention," Willow said when Claire finally straightened
 up.</p>

<p>"That makes two of us," she responded. "I guess that we're
equally idiots," she continued with a smile.</p>

<p>"You're in Walsh's class
right?" Willow asked as they started walking in the same direction.
"Claire?"</p>

<p>"Two for two," Claire responded. "It's the voice right?" Willow
just kind of shrugged and nodded at the same time. Not an easy feat. "Your
name's Willow right?"</p>

<p>"Just like the tree," Willow told her with a
smile.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here so late?" Claire asked. "Usually it's
like the Isle of dead out here at night. No one's in sight."</p>

<p>"Yeah,
that's because people a habit of disappearing or dying of mysterious causes
around here," Willow said shaking her head.</p>

<p>"So?" Claire asked. "I
promise to submit to the Inquisition too."</p>

<p>"I'm just going to meet a
friend," Willow said looking down at the ground.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Claire asked.
If it wasn't so dark out Willow would have seen the knowing look on her
face, but it was dark out so she didn't.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow responded
smiling. "Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Just seen her in class. Like you," Claire
responded. "Where are you going? Maybe I'll walk you, safety in numbers you
know."</p>

<p>"It's probably out of your way," Willow responded. "We're meeting
down by the stadium."</p>

<p>"That's.odd," Claire responded. Willow
smiled.</p>

<p>"It's, well it's pretty deserted out there," she explained.
Vampires loved deserted and quiet. Buffy usually got some action out there
whenever she patrolled.</p>

<p>"Oh," Claire said smiling. "I get it," she
continued. She kind of shook her head after that, she thought that it was
absolutely deplorable that people who were so obviously in love with each
other had to sneak around and hide because small minded assholes ruled the
world.</p>

<p>"Yep," Willow responded doubting very much that Claire got it at
all.</p>

<p>"Well this is where I get off," Claire said stopping in front of one
of the dorms. "I just want you to know that I think it's great," Claire
added.</p>

<p>"What?" Willow asked confused.</p>

<p>"You and Buffy," Claire told
her. "It's so hard to find someone that you connect with in this world, and
when you find someone you should hold on to them, taboos and idiots be
damned."</p>

<p>"Wha." was all Willow managed to get out before Claire
continued.</p>

<p>"With all the homophobia out there most people are so afraid
to just be themselves. I think that you two are some of the bravest people
I've ever met," Claire continued before heading towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Bu.bu.but," Willow kind of squeaked out.</p>

<p>"Yeah, bye,"
Claire said. "I know you'll have a nice night," she added with a wink. After
that she disappeared behind the door leaving Willow there staring at the
building completely, utterly,
bewildered.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>From
her spot behind the tree Buffy saw Willow approaching her. Buffy knew that
Willow couldn't see her where she was standing, so she waited behind the
tree for Willow so that she could surprise her.</p>

<p>"What's a nice girl like
doing in a place like this?" Buffy asked coming out from behind the tree as
Willow walked by, and wrapping her arm around Willow's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Willow said distractedly.</p>

<p>"Don't sound so
enthusiastic Will," Buffy said. "I might actually think that you were happy
to see me," Buffy continued.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Willow responded. "I'm glad to see
you, that's why I came out here after all."</p>

<p>"Not because you were
bored and the phone lines are down?" Buffy asked knowing that Willow's
laptop was her other best friend.</p>

<p>"Nope, just because you're so
irresistible," Willow told her.</p>

<p>"You okay Will?" Buffy asked watching the
hacker closely. "You don't look so hot."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much,"
Willow said making face.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it that way," Buffy said drawing
Willow in a bit giving her a hug.</p>

<p>"I know," Willow said. It was just
that she couldn't get her mind off of what Claire had said before she left.
She hadn't come right out and said it, but it was clear that she was under
the impression that she and Buffy were lovers or something like that anyway.
She knew that the way she felt about Buffy was more than friendly, but she
didn't think that it was so obvious that strangers could pick up on it. She
was slightly uneasy with the idea. She didn't really care if people knew
about her, not now that she was out of High School anyway, but she wasn't
comfortable with people thinking that she and Buffy were a couple. Although
the idea gave her the fuzzies, it wasn't fair to Buffy to have people
thinking something about her that wasn't true. The trouble was that she
didn't know what to do about it.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Buffy asked, something
was definitely up with Willow.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Willow said. "I was just
thinking about a paper I have to write," she said deciding to keep what she
had learned earlier to herself for the moment.</p>

<p>"School, I tell you
it's a pox on all of us free spirits," Buffy said taking Willow's hand into
her own.</p>

<p>Willow squeezed back and smiled then they continued on
patrol.</p>

</table>

<P>Xander lay stretched out across the couch watching the
people spread out around the room surrounding him. Giles was in the corner of
the room sorting through some old musty books in boxes, Spike was sitting in
front of the stereo with head-phones on listening to an old Led Zeppelin album
and Anya had disappeared into one of the back rooms after announcing that she
was bored and none of them were entertaining her so she could as well just go to
sleep. Thinking back to her exit Xander had to smile. The girl was an original.
</p>
<P>What he was really paying attention to however, was Willow
and Buffy. They were sitting on chairs at opposite ends of the room not doing
much of anything. At first Willow had pretended to be interested in Giles' books
but she soon gave up on that. As for Buffy she had been flipping through the
same issue of Vogue for about an hour. Xander doubted that any of them had been
anything but a series of hoots and hollers to her since the picked up the
magazine. Neither of them was crying or throwing a hissy fit or anything, but he
could tell that something was bothering both of them. They had both been
freakishly quiet since arriving, and there was just this feeling of unease in
the air. He knew that the way their lives were it led to a lot of shifting,
shuffling emotions floating around all the time, but things had been relatively
quiet in town lately so he didn't understand what was up with them. Especially
since they had seemed happier in the past few weeks than in a long time,
especially Buffy. </p>
<P>Xander knew that he wasn't exactly "Share your soul with me"
guy. He was jokey friend guy and he understood his role, but it didn't stop him
from worrying, and from sometimes wishing that he was "Share your soul with me
guy". The people in the house (and his parent when they were nice to him), were
his entire world, except of course for Spike. But he wasn't Mr. Emotional Chat
man, so he mostly had to let his actions be the testament of his feeling for
them all. </p>
<P>But, as he lay there watching them, he didn't know what
action he could take that would help. </p>
<P>"Hey!" Spike said breaking Xander's musings. He was banging
on the top of Giles' record player. "Fix it," he continued in the same agitated
voice. </p>
<P>"Stop that right now," Giles said getting up and walking
over to where Spike was. "You're going to break it." </p>
<P>"It's not working," Spike said still banging away.
</p>
<P>"That's because you keep hitting it," Giles said trying to
get Spike to stop. </p>
<P>"Slag off," Spike said waving his hands about trying to get
Giles to leave him alone. </p>
<P>Giles took a step back and just stared at him a for moment.
</p>
<P>"I haven't gone to the butchers yet," Giles finally said in
a warning. </p>
<P>"I'll be good," Spike promised even though he was glaring at
Giles like he wanted to rip his limbs from his body. Giles smiled and walked
back over to his books. </p>
<P>Once Spike was what Giles deemed a safe distance away from
his record player things calmed down once more. </p>
<P>"Buffy," Willow said looking over to where her friend was
sitting. </p>
<P>"What's up?" Buffy asked. She was already halfway across the
room. </p>
<P>"How would you feel about doing a little heavy lifting?"
Willow asked flashing Buffy her most charming smile. </p>
<P>"I'd feel like a sucker, but I'll do it anyway," Buffy
responded coming to stand behind Willow. Willow smiled up at Buffy and the
Slayer kneeled down to await instructions. </p>
<P>As Willow started directing Buffy to the boxes which needed
to be moved and where they needed to be moved to, Xander got off the couch
(finally) and followed Spike when the vampire began to move into the backrooms.
He still didn't trust vamp-boy and Anya was back there. </p>
<P>'What do you think you're doing?" Spike asked swinging
around to face Xander. </p>
<P>"Making sure that you don't eat my Anya," Xander responded
getting right up in Spike's face. </p>
<P>"As if," Spike responded before making a face at his own
response. He'd been in California for too long…way too long. </p>
<P>"What? Like you're so above eating people?" Xander
responded. </p>
<P>"I'm above eating her," Spike said getting in Xander's face.
"Not that I could even I wanted to," he added backing away. </p>
<P>"So I hear you and Buffy spent some quality time together
yesterday," Xander said. He wasn't quite finished with Spike yet. "Should I be
dusting off the ol' tux?" </p>
<P>"Go away," Spike said testily. </p>
<P>"What's going on here?" Xander asked. He wanted some
answers. He knew that Spike was in the middle of whatever was going on. Then
again Xander blamed famine and just about every other bad thing on Spike too.
</p>
<P>"I'm GOING to take a nap," Spike said in response. "Day time
is sleep time." </p>
<P>"Alright, that's it lemon-head," Xander said pushing Spike
against the wall. "I want to know what you did to Buffy and Willow." </p>
<P>"I didn't do anything," Spike said indignantly. "She tried
to stake me!" </p>
<P>"If she tried to stake you, you'd be dust," Xander
responded. </p>
<P>"Listen you bloody moron, whatever is going on between Muffy
and Pine tree out there has nothing to do with me," Spike responded. </p>
<P>"And I'm suppose to just take your oh so not trustworthy
word on that?" Xander asked. </p>
<P>"I cannot believe that you're a critical part of the 'on
crack' team that routinely foiled my plans," Spike responded shaking his head.
"Just look at them, for the love of God, just bloody look at them!" he said
waving his hand in the direction of the two girls. "If I have to be witness to
one more poignant silence, or longing gaze I'll throw myself on a damn stake."
</p>
<P>Xander turned his head to look at Buffy and Willow and see
if he could make any sense whatsoever out of what Spike was saying. When he
watched them he didn't see anything out of the ordinary. It looked like Buffy
had just finished with the boxes and was helping Willow and Giles put away the
rest of the books. Giles was saying something to Willow, what it was Xander
couldn't hear, and Buffy was listening. The Slayer had her hand resting on
Willow's shoulder but was looking in Giles' direction. Shortly after that the
Watcher got up and headed for the kitchen shooting Xander and Spike an odd look
as he did. Xander ignored it and continued to watch his friends. Buffy, her hand
still on Willow's shoulder, kneeled down so that they were now side by side on
the floor. Once she was down there she leaned over and whispered something into
Willow's ear. Whatever it was it must have been amusing because Willow broke out
into a huge grin and eventually ended up shaking her head and looking down at
the ground. </p>
<P>"I don't know what you're talking about, there's nothing…"
Xander started to say to Spike, but then he was interrupted when he saw
something that he hadn't noticed before. Buffy had shifted position so that she
was now sitting cross legged on the floor and was putting away books too. It
wasn't that that caught his attention, but the expression on Willow's face. She
was watching Buffy intently, a small, gentle smile playing across her face. Then
Buffy turned her head and Willow quickly returned her gaze to the books in front
of her. Then, while Willow was busy putting away some of the books Buffy looked
at her with the same kind of look Willow had been giving her moments before.
There seemed to be this potential energy surrounding Buffy as she looked at
Willow, like in chemistry or psychics. It was like she wanted to do something,
but couldn't. Like she was just lying in wait for her potential energy to be
released. </p>
<P>Xander backed away from Spike, who muttered something then
went into the kitchen to badger Giles, but continued to watch the interaction
between Buffy and Willow. There was something captivating about it and he
couldn't quite pull himself away. It was like he was on the verge of making a
great discovery. As he watched them he remembered what Spike had said, and it
did seem kind of poignant. Even though he didn't really know what he was looking
at, there was something there it could feel it…see it, even from where he was.
Then another thing Spike had said started ringing in his head. Longing. And
there was longing there, you could see it in their eyes, if you were looking for
it that was. </p>
<P>He leaned back against the wall confused. He didn't
understand what he was seeing. He didn't understand what was going on.
</p>
<P>"What are you doing? Are we hiding?" Anya asked sneaking up
behind him. Xander jumped slightly. "What are we hiding from?" </p>
<P>"We're not hiding," Xander said glancing over at her.
</p>
<P>"That's good cause this really isn't a good spot," she
responded rubbing her hand over his pecks. "Maybe we SHOULD go hide," she
suggested a moment later sliding up against him. </p>
<P>"I can't, not now," Xander said returning his attention to
the two girls in the living room. </p>
<P>"Why not?" Anya whined. </p>
<P>"I'm trying to solve a problem. It's important," Xander
said. </p>
<P>"What is it? Maybe I can help," she said looking over his
shoulder. "I want to have an orgasm." </p>
<P>"What did I tell you about saying things like that in
public?" Xander asked turning around. </p>
<P>"But we aren't in public…not really," Anya pointed out. They
were the only ones in the hallway. </p>
<P>"Right," Xander said turning his head again. "Is it just me
or do you sense something going on between them?" he asked waving in Buffy and
Willow's general direction. </p>
<P>"Nothing more than usual," Anya said trying to drag Xander
into the bedroom. </p>
<P>"Usual?" Xander asked. </p>
<P>"Uh huh," Anya said still tugging to no avail. </p>
<P>"What's the usual?" Xander asked wondering if he was the
only person in the dark about this mystery 'thing' going on. </p>
<P>"Sexual tension/frustration, unrequited love yadda, yadda,
yadda," Anya responded. "Is that it? Can we have sex now?" </p>
<P>"What?" Xander asked in a high pitched voice. </p>
<P>"They obviously want to sleep together, but no doubt some
stupid human emotion is keeping them from telling each other, so they just sit
there holding hands pretending they don't want to have sex, while
unintentionally charging the air around them with unresolved sexual tension.
It's sad really, sex is good and they'd make good orgasm friends," Anya
responded. "Can we please have sex now?" </p>
<P>Xander turned around and stared at Anya for a second. Buffy
and Willow…that way? No way. Buffy and Willow didn't…they weren't…that was just
nuts. </p>
<P>"You're silly," Xander said finally. "Stop being so silly,"
he continued. "You silly girl…silly." </p>
<P>"Fine," Anya said. "I'll take care of it myself," and with
that she headed back in the direction she had come from. </p>
<P>Xander watched her go but he was rooted to the spot where he
was. He had known Willow for almost his entire life, and he'd known Buffy for a
good portion of his adolescence. He thought that he knew them as well as anyone
else, and he thought that he would be aware if there was anything 'gay' about
them. No, he thought to himself, they're just good friends, best friends. He
knew that he and Jesse never went around holding hands and hugging each other,
but they were guys and guys and girls acted differently. Lots of girls,
completely heterosexual girls, who were friends were close like Buffy and
Willow. Still, looking at them sitting there…there seemed to be something more.
</p>
<P>He shook his head, they couldn't be…could they? Nah, he was
just watching pay-per view a wee bit too much. If they were he would
know…wouldn't he? Of course. Right? </p>

<P>"Where is everybody?" Anya asked finally emerging from the
back room. </p>
<P>"Buffy's out walking Spike, and Xander and Giles went to the
butchers shop," Willow responded looking up from her book. Giles always had the
best spell books just lying around his house. </p>
<P>"Oh," Anya said taking a seat on the couch. "Are you doing
anything fun?" </p>
<P>"Well, I was looking through Volume III of the Dreger's
almanac, and I found this super cool incantation for…" Willow started to say but
Anya interrupted her. </p>
<P>"Please, stop," Anya said holding up her hand. "I'm already
regretting my inquiry immensely." </p>
<P>"Boy, you must be a joy to be around in the morning," Willow
said as Anya yawned. </p>
<P>"Mornings tend to lose their thrill after 2000 years or so,"
Anya responded. "Let's see how you're doing after your first millennia," she
continued. </p>
<P>They sat in silence for a while after that, but Willow found
it impossible to concentrate on the text with Anya sitting behind her doing
nothing. </p>
<P>"You know," Willow said standing up and moving over to the
couch. "It occurs to me that we've never really had the opportunity to just sit
down and talk." </p>
<P>"Are we going to bond now?" Anya asked looking over at her.
</p>
<P>"We're going try," Willow said building up her resolve. "We
are certainly going to try." </p>

<hr width=100>

<P>"I don't see why I have to be here," Spike grumbled kicking
a pebble along the ground. </p>
<P>"You said you wanted some fresh air, so I'm giving you some
fresh air," Buffy responded. "Now be good or I'll put on your leash."
</p>
<P>"I don't bloody believe this!" Spike exclaimed kicking a
wall. "Oh! God! Bloody hell that hurts!" he said now bouncing on his good foot
holding the one he'd hurt. "I'm William the Bloody, the scourge of Europe…and
some of Asia. Whole country sides bowed down to my will…" </p>
<P>"One more word out of you Mister and I swear…" Buffy said
holding up the leash and clicking the clasp. </p>
<P>"Why don't you just stake me?" Spike muttered under his
breath. </p>
<P>"Don't temp me," Buffy retorted. "I'm disliking you more
than usual right now…which is saying a lot." </p>
<P>"Oh, this is about Birch again isn't it?" he asked limping
slightly. </p>
<P>"That's it," Buffy said reaching out for him. "An important
part of functioning in society is learning to respect authority. Without that
fundamental respect, chaos ensues…as you well know. You, Spike, have spent too
much time on the outskirts of society and it is my duty not only as the Slayer,
but as a human being, to re-integrate you," Buffy continued attaching the leach
to his collar. </p>
<P>"Were you this mean when you WERE getting some?" Spike
asked. Buffy simply yanked in response. "I'll take that as a yes," Spike
muttered under his breath. </p>

<hr width=100>

<P>"So," Willow started. "How are things going with you and
Xander?" She could only hope that her inquiry wouldn't be met with graph
descriptions of the sex they were having. </p>
<P>"He's distracted," Anya responded. "I had to make my own
orgasm," she added sourly. </p>
<P>Willow visibly paled. </p>
<P>"TMI," Willow said clasping her hands over her ears.
"T-M-I," she said again pronouncing each letter distinctly. </p>
<P>"I'm not familiar with that acronym," Anya said completely
unfazed. "Explain." </p>
<P>"Too Much Information," Willow responded finally unclasping
her hands from the side of her head. </p>
<P>"You shouldn't have asked then," Anya responded. "I don't
understand why humans insist on making queries that they don't wish to know the
answers to. It's highly illogical." </p>
<P>"Thank you for sharing that diatribe Mr. Spock," Willow
responded. Her face was starting to regain colour. </p>
<P>"Mr. Spock? Is that some sort of pop-culture reference?"
Anya asked. "Because I don't do those." </p>
<P>"Okay," Willow said shifting her position. "This is not
going at all according to plan." </p>
<P>Anya just stared at her. </p>
<P>"Maybe we should just forget about this 'bonding' thing and
go back to sitting in silence," Willow suggested. She knew that silence was
looking really good to her at the moment. </p>
<P>"Wouldn't a change of topic be more appropriate?" Anya
asked. She wasn't really a fan of the silence. Besides she did have something in
mind to talk about. </p>
<P>"Yeah," Willow responded eyeing her a bit. "Sure, change of
topic, a topic different from the original…a whole new area of discussion, a
completely separate…" </p>
<P>"I get it," Anya said interrupting. "It's new." </p>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Before I start I'd like to make it clear that I'm not at
all interested in seeing you attain any sort of happiness," Spike said as Buffy
dragged him along. </p>
<P>"Ditto," she said simply. </p>
<P>"But…" </p>
<P>"There's always a but," Buffy muttered. </p>
<P>"Why don't you just tell her how you feel and get it the
hell over with so that I can get some goddamn rest," he continued testily.
</p>
<P>"There's nothing to tell," Buffy said yanking him a bit. For
someone who was technically dead he sure did talk a lot. </p>
<P>"Yeah, and I'm Martha Stewart," Spike responded. </p>
<P>"Well, that menorah you made for Willow really was very
pretty," Buffy said smiling. </p>
<P>"I was bored and Giles had just gotten back from the pottery
barn," Spike said defensively. </p>
<P>"Keep telling yourself that," Buffy said turning down the
road that would bring them back to Giles'. </p>
<P>"Come on," Spike said. "Talking about it will make you feel
better." </p>
<P>Buffy just looked back and glared at him. </p>
<P>"I won't tell anyone, I swear it," Spike continued when
Buffy didn't respond. </p>
<P>"Since you seem to be so smart why do you need me to tell
you anything?" Buffy asked. She wasn't even really upset at Spike, he was just
being…well Spike. She was upset that she was seriously considering talking to
him. Besides Claire and her posse, Spike was the only person Buffy knew was hip
to her feelings about Willow, and she really needed to talk about it.
</p>
<P>"I was just trying to be civil," Spike responded in a
slightly wounded tone. "Since I can't kill you and all," he added under his
breath. </p>
<P>"I can't tell her," Buffy mumbled. </p>
<P>"Why the hell not?" Spike asked. Humans were so annoying,
that's why he ate so many of them. </p>
<P>"I don't want to ruin our friendship," Buffy answered.
"Telling someone that you're in love with them and want their body usually tends
to have SOME sort of effect on a relationship." </p>
<P>"Yeah," Spike agreed. "You tell her and then you both have
sex, and I don't have to watch you pining after her anymore. Everybody wins, but
more importantly I'M happy." </p>
<P>"If I tell her, there won't be any sex or anything else to
be had since she doesn't feel the same way I do, "Buffy said scuffing her shoes
along the ground. "She's probably still not even over Oz." </p>
<P>"Who?" Spike asked staring at Buffy's neck. </p>
<P>She looked back at him. </p>
<P>"The werewolf," Buffy responded. </p>
<P>"Oh him," Spike responded. "She's not in love with him. I'm
sure he was very snuggly but they were just passing time." </p>
<P>"Excuse me?" Buffy asked stopping and trying around to face
the vampire. </p>
<P>"I'm surrounded by stupidity, utter, ubiquitous stupidity,"
Spike said exasperated flinging his hands into the air. "I try, and I try, but
I'm a demon not a bloody miracle worker." </p>
<P>"Are you finished wallowing in self pity?" Buffy asked.
Spike nodded sullenly. "Okay, then do you mind telling me what the hell you were
getting at with that 'passing time' comment?" </p>
<P>"Willow's in love with you too!" Spike exclaimed. "Whenever
you're in the same room she's gives off as many pheromones as bloody dog in
heat." </p>
<P>"You went to the 'Cordelia Chase School of Tact', didn't
you?" Buffy asked looking him. </p>
<P>"Honesty's the best policy," Spike respond shrugging.
</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow somehow got the impression that her conversation with
Anya was going to be a trying event, so before they started in with the new
conversation she went into the kitchen to get some refreshments. </p>
<P>"So," Anya said once Willow re-joined her in the room. "When
are you and Buffy going to become orgasm friends?" </p>
<P>Willow sat in a stunned silence and started at her. The
hacker thought that she was alive, she could still see and think, but she felt
oddly detached from her body, like she wasn't really in it, let alone in the
room. </p>
<P>"Oh god, I think I killed her," Anya said when Willow didn't
respond. The ex-vengeance demon moved over and the couch and started poking her.
"Are you dead?" she asked. "Because I don't think that the others are going to
like that." </p>
<P>"You…I …you…said…orgasm," was all Willow managed to get out
before her oral skills once again deserted her. </p>
<P>"Well?" Anya asked. </p>
<P>"I…me…Buffy…me…and Buffy…not…one with…orgasm," Willow said.
She couldn't seem to get past that word. </p>
<P>"I'm beginning to think that the silence probably would have
been the better of the two ideas," Anya commented. </p>
<P>"Buffy…Buffy doesn't feel the same way I do," Willow said a
few moments later in a soft voice. </p>
<P>"Really?" Anya asked. "What Buffy are you talking about,
because the Buffy I know can barely keep her eyes, and hands off of you," she
continued. </p>
<P>"No," Willow said. She was sure that there was more to that
sentence but "no" was all that came out. </p>
<P>"Ah, yeah," Anya responded. </p>
<P>"No," Willow said again. Her brain refused to engage.
</p>
<P>"Yeah," Anya retorted. </p>
<P>"No." </p>
<P>"Yeah." </p>

<P>Buffy and Spike arrived back at Giles' house shortly before
Xander and Giles got back, and on the tail end of Anya and Willow's conversation
which they were assured was "nothing". By the time they had all gathered in the
house again it was getting late and Buffy and Willow decided that it would
probably be best to head on back home. Xander and Anya also had to catch up on
the some quality time before Giles brought Spike over to Xander's, so they left
at the same time as the Slayer and hacker. </p>
<P>Buffy and Willow were now back in their dorm rooms lying on
their respective beds staring up at the ceiling thinking about the completely
bizarre conversations they had had with their respective partners. </p>
<P>"Will?" Buffy asked finally. </p>
<P>"Yeah," Willow answered. </p>
<P>"I don't think that I'm going to take Spike for anymore
walks," Buffy said decisively. </p>
<P>"I don't want to bond with Anya," Willow said in response.
</p>
<P>"It's been a peculiar couple of days," Buffy continued still
staring at the ceiling. </p>
<P>"Very peculiar," Willow repeated. </p>
<P>"Yep," Buffy said. </p>
<P>"What were you and Anya talking about anyway?" Buffy asked
tilting her head to the side. </p>
<P>"The Book of Levitain, I thought that it was a well-written
worthwhile piece of literature, and Anya thought that it was unadulterated
crap," Willow responded thinking quickly. </p>
<P>"Don't you hate it when that happens?" Buffy asked.
</p>
<P>"What about you and Spike?" Willow asked. "You two seem to
be at each others throats even more than usual." </p>
<P>"He's just really, really, irritating," Buffy responded.
"Really." </p>
<P>"Really?" Willow asked turning her head so that she was
looking at Buffy. </p>
<P>"Cute," Buffy responded in a dry tone even though she was
smiling. </p>
<P>'As always," Willow responded grinning before returning her
gaze to the ceiling. </p>
<P>"You know coming from anyone else that would have sounded
impudent," Buffy said still watching Willow. "But coming from you…it's a
statement of absolute truth," she continued in a soft almost reverent tone.
</p>
<P>When Buffy had finished speaking Willow turned her head back
around so that she was looking directly into Buffy's eyes. They held each others
gaze for what felt like an eternity, drowning in the depths of each others eyes,
longing to be closer. They continued this until Buffy finally broke the contact
by returning her gaze to the ceiling with a soft, inaudible sigh. She couldn't
trust herself to continue looking at Willow, and remain only looking. She wasn't
stoic, but she wasn't exactly an open book either. Yet, despite her median
disposition Willow had always been able to tell how she was feeling, just from
looking at her. Even when Buffy was beyond confident that her face showed no
emotion at all, somehow Willow still knew. That's why she had to look away,
because Willow couldn't know this, not yet, maybe even not ever. </p>
<P>"Did you notice something going on with Xander today?"
Willow asked a few moments after Buffy had looked away from her. As she asked
she shifting her position a little trying to get comfortable. The look that they
had shared, it had touched her in some deep place and she was feeling nervous.
It had left her with this craving to hear Buffy's voice, to be close to her.
</p>
<P>"He seemed kind of agitated…but he's always like that so…"
Buffy just left the sentence hanging. She had really said all that she planned
on saying so there was no reason to continue. "Why?" she asked as an
afterthought. </p>
<P>"Anya said that he was distracted about something," Willow
responded. </p>
<P>"That what you two were talking about? Xander?" Buffy asked.
She knew that Willow was lying when she had answered earlier. The book of
Levitain had been burned down along with the school in June. </p>
<P>"At first," Willow said. "But then…" </p>
<P>"Then what?" Buffy asked encouragingly. </p>
<P>"She…you really don't need to hear this," Willow said. "I
didn't need to hear this. If there was a way that I could possibly undo hearing
it, I would do it, but I can't so I suffer." </p>
<P>"Come on, tell me," Buffy said. "It'll make you feel
better." </p>
<P>"She…well she…she started talking about how she had to make
her own orgasm's," Willow said in a rush. </p>
<P>"Oh," was all Buffy said in response. She wasn't expecting
that, she thought that it was going to be some demon thing, a curse or something
like that. </p>
<P>"Yeah," Willow said nodding knowingly. This kind of thing
had a way of leaving one speechless. </p>
<P>"On that note…" Buffy started to say slowly. </p>
<P>"We should probably just go to sleep," Willow finished for
her. </p>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy responded nodding even though she wasn't
really very tired. </p>
<P>"Okay then," Willow said. She sounded like she was trying to
talk herself into it. </p>
<P>"Sleep it is," Buffy said in response. </p>
<P>"Goodnight Buff," Willow said turning out her light.
</p>
<P>"Night Red," Buffy said turning out hers. </p>
<P>As they lay there in a comfortable silence, both pretending
to be asleep, their thoughts ran along identical paths. It had all started with
a rumor, but it had evolved far beyond that in the few days since it all
started. The issue had changed from who was speculating what, to the very real
emotions that had been growing inside of them both for a very long time. A rumor
had changed it all. The creature that-until those fateful days-had been content
to stay on the fringes of their consciousness, had now stirred and crept forth
into their conscious minds, settling, and allowing them no rest. It all started
with a rumor, but it had been far eclipsed by itself. It was ironic although
they didn't know it at the time. Two girl, two friends, two souls both with the
same secret, same fears, and same love. Both oblivious to the fact that the
plight of the other was the same as their own. As they drifted off to sleep they
were both aware that something needed to be done, but the question that nagged
at them, consumed them, was what? What could be done? What should be done? And
of all of the actions or inaction's they could choose, which ones, which one,
could they live with? In the end, it all came down to one thing. Love. And the
real question that they were asking themselves was, was love worth it? Was it
worth it worth risking the single most important thing in their lives-their
friendship-for? </p>
<P>The answer…well, the answer whatever it be, would change
their lives forever.</p>
