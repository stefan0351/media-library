<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 9 -->

<p>It only took Josh a couple of minutes to locate Brooke before practice
started.  The Glamazons were practicing so he knew that she had to be
around.  He wasn't prepared for the sight that greeted him however, although
he supposed that he should have been given his chat with Nicole.  Brooke was
dressed in her uniform and was standing off to the side of the bleachers,
with Sam.  Brooke had her head tilted away from him but he could tell that
she was laughing, and Sam had her hand up by her face obviously laughing as
well.  They were standing closer to each other than was necessary, or even
really acceptable in some circles-a particularly noteworthy event
considering that they didn't used to be able to occupy the same room.  It
became painfully clear to him that Nicole was on the right track about the
two of them.  Immediately he head over to the two of them.</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke said spotting him coming towards them.  She was still smiling
and Josh couldn't help but think that she didn't look like someone who was
an emotional wreck.  Still he had his mission, when coach called a play you
executed it even if you did have doubts.</p>

<p>"Hey," he replied with a smile of his own.  "Sam," he said turning to the
brunette.  She in turn offered him a little smile and a salute.  "I just
need to borrow her a minute," he continued gesturing towards Brooke before
resting his hand on her back and pushing her away.  Doing such he missed
Sam's raised eyebrow and Brooke's amused shrug.</p>

<p>"You know, I am capable of walking on my own," Brooke commented once they
were a safe distance away.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Josh commented distractedly.  He was eyeing Sam who had taken out a
notebook and was writing something in it, his mind involuntarily going back
to Nicole's comment about Sam writing an expository on Brooke.  He frowned.</p>

<p>"Is everything already?" Brooke asked looking at the boy carefully.  Even
though things hadn't worked out between them, she still cared deeply for him
and was disturbed by the idea that something might be wrong with him.</p>

<p>"No," he said his voice wavering a bit.  "Things are just…I mean I know that
we're not…anymore…but I really need to talk to you."</p>

<p>"You know I'm here for you," Brooke responded sincerely.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Josh responded although he sounded less than convinced.  "I can't
talk about it here though…could you come by later?" he asked gazing at
Brooke with puppy dog eyes.</p>

<p>Brooke observed him for a minute.  He had been so despondent after she had
broken up with him, and really had never bounced back to his previous self,
and for that she felt terribly guilty.</p>

<p>"Of course," she responded, happy to see him smile.</p>

<p>"Great," he responded.  "I'll see you later then," and with that he headed
off towards the field and Brooke walked back over to where Sam was waiting
for her.</p>
