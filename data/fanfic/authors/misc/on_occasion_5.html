<p align=center>-- Richard Marx  Playing with fire.</p>

<p>The flames were getting higher.  Willow couldn't believe it...she couldn't
believe she was going to die tied to a stake in the schools gymnasium, and
her own mother was holding the torch.  It didn't seem possible...it didn't
seem real...but it was.  &quot;Buffy, I can't take it! It's too hot!&quot;  She cried,
pleadingly to her lover who was struggling mightily to get free.  Amy had
made her escape seconds before, by turning into a mouse.  Too bad she hadn't
stopped to do them the same favor.</p>

<p>Buffy turned apologetic eyes her way, looking at her lover through the smoke
rising up from the books scattered around them.  &quot;I'm sorry, Will. If it
wasn't for me, none of this would have happened.&quot; She'd tried everything she
could think of to get out of this, tried pleading with her mother to
recognize the insanity of burning her own child at the stake, tried getting
out of these ropes, but there were too many of them, and they'd tied them
too tight.  Still, she struggled, not willing to give up for a second, not
while Willow was still
in danger.</p>

<p>The smoke was starting to choke her, it filled her lungs, sending great
coughing heaves through her body.  She knew there was a room full of people
watching her, but she also knew that she didn't have a lot of time left.
She couldn't help it...if she was going to die, she wanted it to be with
Buffy's name on her lips.  &quot;Buffy...&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy stared into vibrant green eyes and stopped her struggling for a
nanosecond.  &quot;I love you, Will.&quot;  She mouthed.  The redhead recieved the
sentiment and sent it back, just as clearly.  Neither noticed Giles when he
came through the door...they were both focused on each other.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the distance they noticed the sound of glass breaking, but it
didn't really get their attention until the collected mob started crying out
to stop the invaders.  Buffy was immediately surprised and relieved to see
Cordelia holding a fire hose on the overworked crowd.  She took a guilty
pleasure in seeing people getting washed away by the hose, but she did wish
Cordelia would hurry up and get the hose onto them...or more accurately the
fire just below them.</p>

<p>Giles was speaking something badly in what Willow thought was German, but
she couldn't pay too much attention to that considering the flames had
reached her and were starting to burn through her clothes.  &quot;Buffy, I'm on
fire!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cordelia, put out the fire!&quot;  Buffy shouted, with no short amount of
urgency.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right.&quot;  Cordelia said, taking aim at the flames now, much to Buffy,
and Willow's relief.</p>

<p>Giles continued to speak his muddled german, then he threw two vials at the
children. Seconds later the children were replaced by a grotesque, seven
foot tall demon.  &quot;Okay, I think I liked the two little ones more than the
one big one.&quot;  Cordelia said, in a sarcastic murmur.</p>

<p>It looked like the rest of the crowd agreed with her, people were screaming
and running out of the building, Joyce and Sheila were staring at the demon
in horror.  The trance was broken, and Joyce looked from the repulsive beast
to where she had several others had tied
Buffy and Willow to stakes, and felt herself go faint.  &quot;Oh my god.&quot; she
whispered, feeling the enormity of the act settle over her.</p>

<p>&quot;Protect us! Kill the bad girls!&quot;  The demon growled, but this time the
words fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>&quot;You know what?&quot;  Buffy asked, her voice filled with anger.  &quot;Not as
convincing in that outfit.&quot;   The demon growled and came after her.  Buffy
struggled anew at the ropes, but they just wouldn't give...luckily for her,
the stake did, she heard it snap near the base and the extra weight of it on
her back forced her to bend over.  She couldn't see it coming, but she felt
it as it impaled itself on the accidental weapon.  &quot;God, this thing weighs a
ton.&quot; She thought, struggling to stand erect.  &quot;Did I get it? Did I get it?&quot;
  She asked, nervously, and just a little out of breath.  Just then the
ceiling above them gave way, and Oz and Xander came crashing down.   The two
men stared at the odd sight for a moment, before Oz broke the silence with
his usual straightforwardness.  &quot;We're here to save you.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy bit back a chuckle, merely rolled her eyes and sighed.  &quot;Great...would
you mind getting this thing off my back?  It weighs a ton and it's getting
goop all over me...not that it's never happened before.&quot;  Buffy griped,
sarcastically.</p>

<p>Xander and Oz scrambled to help Buffy free herself of the extra weight.
Joyce had rid herself of her guilt complex for the moment and was presently
helping to untie Willow. &quot;What a mess.&quot;  Cordelia shook her head as she
examined the place.  &quot;I'm not cleaning it.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy rolled her eyes.  'Typical.'  She watched as Oz and Xander gathered
the body of the dead demon.  She didn't know where they would take it...only
that they would take it to where nobody would trip over it.  She looked over
to where the redhead was making her way over the piles of books toward her.
&quot;You okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow shrugged and wiped at a smudge on the blonde's cheek.  &quot;I'm okay.&quot;
She managed, her voice was a little raspy from the smoke, but at least she
wasn't burnt to a crisp.  &quot;I could use a shower...&quot;  She paused as she
looked at her lover's dishevelled, soot covered, goop splattered body, then
grinned mischievously.  &quot;...so could you.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy laughed, as she looked herself over.  &quot;Yeah...ugh...&quot;  She wiped a
particularly disgusting bit of goop away.  &quot;You're
right...luckily...there's showers not that far away.&quot; She indicated the
shower room that was addexed to the gym.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you girl's sure you're okay...I can't believe I...we almost...&quot;  Buffy
put a comforting hand on her mother's arm, noticing the frazzled, bewildered
air of somebody just released from a spell.  &quot;We're fine, mom.  It's okay.
It wasn't you.  We'll talk about this later,
though...right now...all I want is a shower.&quot;</p>

<p>The two smoky girls headed for the cool, refreshing feel they knew they
would find at the other end of the gymnasium.  Buffy was just about to enter
the shower room when something occured to her.  &quot;Oh...Cordy...would you mind
hunting for Amy? She's...scampering around here somewhere...thanks.&quot;  Buffy
yelled across the room, before she left the room, closing the door behind
her.</p>

<p>&quot;Scampering?&quot;  Cordelia questioned...apparently no one, they were all
walking out in a daze, except for the regular scooby gang, who were starting
to clean up the mess.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy had her shirt off in about two strides, feeling glad to get rid of the
soiled garments. 'Now if I only had something to change into.'  She thought,
removing her pants and underwear with quick movements.  She remembered,
absently, the clothes that she had in her locker, used primarily for gym
class and decided she'd just have to use those, and
return them in the morning.  She was tired, dirty, hurting, and focused only
on getting clean.</p>

<p>Willow, however, was focused on the body that was being revealed right next
to her, and was thinking thoughts altogether different.   Maybe it was the
near death experience, or maybe it was just being near to this perfect body,
this perfect person, who she had almost lost  due to a spell cast by a
gruesome demon and the stupidity of a few townspeople.
And maybe, just maybe there was a small factoid to that saying that danger
made you horny...cause looking at Buffy's increasingly nude body was making
her horny right now.</p>

<p>She watched as Buffy padded, naked, over to the showers, turning on one
without even seeming to notice, then tilted her head back into the spray,
releasing a long sigh of relief. She was mesmerized by the trickle of water
running over the Slayer's body, and almost jealous of the droplets that
clung to her lover's skin, rinsing away the soot and the grime, leaving only
the soft, pink skin behind...she wanted to be those droplets, wanted to
slide delicately over the form and curves of the supple body, she wanted to
be the moisture that cleaned that vibrant body, tasting the surface as she
slid wetly, all the way down the powerful frame.</p>

<p>Eyes opened wide, she felt no trace of her previous exhaustion, all thoughts
of being tired having been swept away by the unwitting display before her.
Buffy's eyes were closed, a look of such complete and utter bliss on her
face that Willow couldn't help but want to be
swept up in it.  Her eyes tracked over the wet skin, noting the graceful
arch of the Slayer's neck, the sculpted perfection of her shoulders...she
always had the strangest urge to bury her face in those strong muscles and
nibble...the rise of her chest...oooh, just looking at the way the water
played over those slopes made her shiver...the fascinating way the liquid
would wash over the washboard tight abdomen in rivulets.  Willow felt her
heartbeat accellerating and wondered abstractly where all the moisture in
her mouth had gone, then
her eyes tracked to where the water was dripping from textured blonde hair
and she felt the answer.  'Oh, there it is.'  She thought abstractly,
licking her lips, almost able to taste those droplets on her tongue.</p>

<p>Her feet moved without her conscious awareness of it, her eyes locked on
Buffy's...everything.  She didn't even notice she was only half undressed as
she stepped under the shower's spray, her focus centered only on the
pulsating need ravaging her from inside out, and her need to quench it.  She
was shaking with the intensity of it, as her hands
came into contact with the Slayer's waist, and her mouth locked onto the
spot she had fantasized about nibbling before.  She felt and heard the
startled gasp as Buffy became aware of her prescence, felt the solid arms
coming up to circle her as hands clenched into the back of her shirt.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?  Wha?&quot;  The surprise was evident in Buffy's voice, as the unexpected
feel of Willow pressing up against her amourously, sent pleasant shivers up
and down her spine.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm...Buffy...I need you.&quot;  Willow whimpered, barely managing to reply, not
wanting to take the necessary time away from her enjoyable task of cleaning
off all of the droplets she could reach with her tongue.</p>

<p>&quot;Need me?&quot;  Buffy felt as if her brain was backfiring, it needed a good
jumpstart. Willow's lips nibbling on her ear provided the energy she needed
to get it working again.  &quot;Right...right now?  At...at school?&quot;  She gulped,
feeling curious and yet knowledgeable hands searching over her back.  A
rapid heat started to consume her as those hands started
to travel south.  'We can't...we're at school...what if somebody comes in?'
All perfectly good, reasonable arguments and questions...too bad they never
made it past her lips.  They were caught racing silently through her brain
as bright, passionate green eyes met her own,
and she could see the fire of lust burning deep within.  She had almost been
burnt alive tonight, just a few minutes earlier by an unruly mob, led by her
own mother...but now she was being burned in an altogether different way.
Albeit, much more pleasant.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, Buffy?&quot;  Willow pleaded, kissing her softly, those eyes beseaching
her.  &quot;I need you so bad.&quot;  She whimpered into her lips, feeling almost
desperate.  &quot;I'll be quiet...nobody will know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You?&quot;  Buffy chuckled, feeling her hormones reving up.  &quot;What about me?&quot;
She asked rhetorically, but then the answer really didn't matter as she had
set herself loose, her self-control already taking more than she thought it
capable of, threw up it's hands in surrender.  Their lips met passionately,
and between the spray and the two of them meshed
together, Buffy didn't know what was making her wetter.  &quot;You forgot to take
your shirt off.&quot;  Buffy noted when they paused for a breath, her eyes taking
in the glorious sight of Willow's pink nipples appearing through the now
transparent shirt.</p>

<p>&quot;I did?&quot;  Willow's brow wrinkled in that cute distracted way she got
sometimes, before she looked down, taking note of the thoroughly drenched
garment.  She started to turn red as she realized what she had done.  &quot;I
must look like an idiot.&quot;  She mumbled, feeling clumsy
next to Buffy's natural grace.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at her in reassurance, while shaking her head.  &quot;No...it looks
real good on you.&quot;  She said honestly, her eyes going back to take in the
outlined nipples.  She couldn't resist their appeal, and her fingers didn't
take long in finding them, playing with them
through the material.  She delighted in Willow's gasps, as her fingers
tightened on the nipples, her thumbs rolling lightly over the sensitive
tips, her eyes never straying from her treasures.  &quot;Real good.&quot;  She said as
she leaned forward and took a mouthful of nipple into her mouth, nipping on
the soft flesh through the material.  But soon Buffy was craving the feel of
Willow's flesh in her mouth and she pulled back.  &quot;But, if you don't
mind...I'm going to take it off now.&quot;  Buffy murmured, lifting the wet
t-shirt up and over Willow's head.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mind...&quot;  Willow trailed off weakly as Buffy resumed her position,
sucking gently on a rosy tip.  She pulled Willow towards her as she leaned
against the wall.  &quot;...at all.&quot; Willow breathed, grasping on to strong
shoulders as she counted on Buffy to keep her standing.</p>

<p>Buffy pulled back after a minute and looked up at Willow, her mouth working
as if she'd tasted something bad.  &quot;Something wrong?&quot;  Willow asked, feeling
suddenly nervous.</p>

<p>&quot;Sooty.&quot;  Buffy replied with a grin, Willow cast a dubious look down at her
chest, wondering how the smoke could have possibly gotten there.  It didn't
matter, Buffy was soon brandishing a bar of soap and doing wonderful things
with it as she moved it in gliding circles over her chest, the gentle
motions causing her nipples to stand erect.  It felt
so good, Willow thought she'd return the favor.  Brandishing a bar of soap
of her own, she started with Buffy's back, caressing her with slow, slippery
circles and working her way down, until they were writhing together like
slippery eels...getting soap lather everywhere.</p>

<p>&quot;How's this for good...clean...fun?&quot;  Willow asked, cheekily, between
kisses, her hands had found Buffy's butt and were busy making the skin nice
and clean, so what if it was a little cleaner than absolutely necessary, she
just loved sliding her fingers through the lather,
finding curious dips and creases to investigate the longer she searched.</p>

<p>&quot;mm, nothing better...than a nice...hot...shower...&quot;  Buffy replied,
breathless, and edging on losing her ability to communicate completely, and
her ability to remain standing was taking its toll as well.  A slip of
Willow's finger over a sensitive area caused Buffy to lose her grasp on the
soap, Willow felt it slide down her abdomen, and over her thigh, coming to
rest next to her right foot.  &quot;Oops...lost the soap.&quot;  Buffy said, a
mischievous grin lightening her eyes, and Willow gulped at the clear message
of lust communicated to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Guess I'm going to have to bend over to get it, huh?&quot;  Buffy's voice was
teasing, but the rich huskiness of it sent waves of pure desire racing
through her blood stream.  &quot;...or maybe...I'll just...work...my way down...&quot;
The murmured words were lost to the sound of the shower running, but the
impact of Buffy's lips, teasing and nipping over sensitive skin as she took
her time, tasting favorite spots on the way to retrieve her missing soap
made Willow lightheaded in delight.</p>

<p>Buffy relished the taste of the clean skin, sucking moisture from pert,
erect peaks, before blazing a trail over sensitive ribs and a ticklish
tummy, until she was kneeling between trembling legs, one hand reaching for
the soap, while the other tickled it's way up one thigh, seeking moisture
that wasn't caused by the steaming water dripping on them.  Buffy took great
pleasure in gently washing the area, feeling Willow jump and hearing barely
restrained cries of pleasure when her fingers would stroke an especially
reactive spot.  She played in her lover's arousal, easily differentiating it
from the shower water, she loved the
difference in texture, how it coated her fingers, in how it tasted when she
brought her fingers to her mouth to lick them clean. She loved the taste of
her, and wanted more.</p>

<p>Ignoring the awkwardness of the position, she wrapped her arms around
Willow's waist and tilted her head up, tasting her lover directly with her
tongue.  Her mouth was immediately flooded with the sweet musk, and she felt
Willow's knees almost buckle as the redhead tested the acoustics of the
room, the room echoing with muffled whimpers.
Buffy could tell Willow was biting her lip in an attempt to keep quiet, and
rewarded her lover's self control with a lick across her clit.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm...Buffy...&quot;  Willow groaned, her hand tightening into a fist in the
blonde's hair, as a quick and agile tongue flicked her most sensitive area
ruthlessly.  Electric sparks were shooting off haphazardly inside her body,
like fireworks at a Fourth of July display, and she felt an unrelenting
pressure building in her stomach, a pressure that had her begging and
reaching for more.  &quot;Buffy...please...&quot; Willow whimpered, unable to
articulate her
need, good thing Buffy knew what she needed, Willow concluded as she felt
two sturdy fingers joining the foray.</p>

<hr>

<p>Joyce looked at her watch again for about the millionth time.  She knew it
had only been about fifteen minutes since the two girls had gone in to take
a shower, but it felt like a lifetime and she was starting to worry.  She
had heard bad things about smoke inhalation, and due to her incredibly
stupid, not to mention disgusting behavior, the two girls probably had
breathed enough smoke for a lifetime.  On the other hand, she didn't think
she'd have to worry about Buffy smoking cigerettes anytime soon.  Glancing
one more time at the closed locker room door, Joyce shook her head
worriedly, wishing she could just go in and make sure they were okay.  But
that might look...strange...and she wasn't sure Buffy would appreciate her
checking up on her.</p>

<p>Spotting Cordelia out of the corner of her eye, she had an idea.  Thinking
about it for a moment, she nodded her head and made her decision.
&quot;Cordelia...&quot; She called out the brunettes name, getting her attention.  She
was eyed warily by the girl, and Joyce had to wonder what had happened to
alter the friendships that had seemed to be blossoming between this girl and
Buffy's friends.</p>

<p>&quot;If Buffy wants to find Amy...she can just find her herself.  She didn't
tell me the girl had turned herself into a rat.&quot;  Cordelia griped, looking
around the gym in disgust.</p>

<p>&quot;Cordelia...&quot;  Joyce started again, reining in her patience.  &quot;Buffy and
Willow have been in the shower for a while and...what with the smoke
inhalation...I'm afraid something might have happened.  Would you mind
checking on them for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Smoke inhalation?&quot;  Cordelia asked, dubiously.  &quot;Buffy's the Slayer...I'm
sure a little smoke isn't going to hurt her...&quot; She started to protest, then
noticed the tension in Joyce's face.  &quot;...but...if it would make you feel
better...&quot;  she said, throwing up her hands in a shrug.  &quot;I'll go look.&quot;</p>

<p>With a great amount of resignation, Cordy trudged over to the locker room
door and pushed it open.  She could hear the sounds of a shower running,
along with unidentifiable sounds she couldn't quite make out.  Her
experience with troubles in Sunnydale had made her cautious, so entering the
room slowly, she barely whispered Buffy's name, then
thumped herself upside the head.  &quot;Right, like she's going to hear that over
the water running.&quot;  She chastized herself, gathering her courage to move
through the room toward the showers.</p>

<p>She wasn't sure what she was expecting to find...a green finned monster
eating the Slayer...Buffy and Willow passed out from the smoke...any number
of things filled her head...but what she ended up seeing wasn't any where
near any one of them.  She spotted the Slayer and Willow all right...in a
position she hadn't imagined in her wildest dreams.
Willow had her head tilted back in the water's spray, a look of sheer
enjoyment on her face, her chest was heaving with big breaths, and quiet
whimpers were leaving her mouth. She looked like she was 'really' enjoying
her shower, and Cordelia suspected she was, what with Buffy's head taking
what looked to be a permanent residence between her legs.</p>

<p>Cordelia was too shocked to squeek, but Willow didn't seem to have any
trouble with it, considering her squeeks were getting louder and
more...what's the word she was searching her addled mind
for...needy...desperate...desperate, yeah that's it.  Willow definitely was
sounding desperate now.  'Oh my god...oh my god...Buffy and Willow...Willow
and Buffy...oh my god.'  The words tumbled over and over again in Cordelia's
head, and she knew she should get out of there and leave them some privacy
but her feet seemed to be stuck to the tiling.</p>

<p>And then it was too late...Willow was scrunching up her face, emitting a
long, low whine, and it looked like Buffy was the only thing holding her up
as her knees started to buckle. Cordelia couldn't believe what she had just
witnessed.  'Oh my god...I've got to get out of here.'  The prospect of
being caught by Buffy was not a pleasant one.  She was pretty sure it would
involve violence, something, her mind reminded her, the Slayer was
exceedingly good at.  Backing up on rubbery legs, she managed to find the
way out, without tripping on anything, and stumbling back out into the Gym.</p>

<p>Joyce saw her come stumbling out of there, looking white as a ghost, and
felt her heart speed up in worry.  &quot;Cordelia?  Are Buffy and Willow all
right?&quot; Cordelia looked up at her in a daze, then started nodding her head,
rapidly.</p>

<p>&quot;They're...they're uh...they're taking a shower.&quot;  Cordy blurted, looking
almost panicked as she pointed her thumb back at the bathroom door.  She
looked around like she was looking for a way out then spotted Xander, and
couldn't help issuing a stinging retort.  &quot;Though
why she was kissing you, I'll never be able to figure out.&quot;  Xander had to
scratch his head in confusion as she stumbled past him, intent only on
finding some fresh air.</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Did you...hear...something?&quot;  Buffy asked, between kisses.  Somehow they
had ended up lying on the floor, Willow resting on top of her, though
neither were sure how they had gotten there, it seemed to be the perfect
position for continuing what they were doing.</p>

<p>&quot;No...can't say...I did...&quot;  Willow murmured, licking her way across Buffy's
chest, stopping to nip at places designed to cause Buffy to shiver.  &quot;But
then...you do have better...hearing...than me...and I was...distracted.&quot;
Willow said, kissing her way across and then down a velvet, tight abdomen.
&quot;What was it?&quot;  Willow asked, licking a line
across Buffy's stomach, just above her pubic bone.</p>

<p>Buffy was finding it hard to breathe as Willow tantalized her senses.
&quot;I...I can't remember.&quot;  In fact, she couldn't even remember her own name.
Willow's nose tickled against her pubic hair, sending an odd sensation to
her stomach.  Willow giggled, and the vibration sent shudders through her
body.  &quot;Will...stop teasing.&quot;  Buffy pleaded, not sure how much more of the
gently inquisitive exploration she could take.</p>

<p>&quot;Was I teasing?&quot;  She inquired, a quirky grin lighting her face.  Buffy eyed
her incredulously, a groan escaping her lips as Willow fought the urge to
giggle.  &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;  She said, contritely, licking Buffy's belly button,
earning another heartfelt groan.  &quot;I'll stop teasing.&quot;  She promised, and
kept her word as she eased into warm wetness.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh...yes...&quot;  Buffy groaned, getting a tighter hold on Willow's head.  She
closed her eyes and just pictured Willow above her, leaning over her, head
busily bobbing as she lapped enthusiastically at her juices.  Willow always
put her all into making love to her...much to her bodies enjoyment.</p>

<p>Being with Buffy was like having your very own all night, ice cream buffet,
Willow thought as she licked up the copious wetness, or...like that folgers
commercial... she was good to the last drop.  And she intended to taste
every last one of them.  She chuckled
mentally, her body jiggling as she tried not to snort into Buffy's folds.
Her lover was getting tauter by the minute, although she remained deathly
quiet, and Willow could never figure out just how she did that, she could
never contain herself that much.  But she knew
Buffy was perilously close to the edge, all she had to do was push her off.</p>

<p>She felt Buffy's warm muscles welcome her in as she slid two fingers deep
inside her, and heard Buffy grunt, enjoying the invasion.  Her mouth
tenderly enveloped Buffy's clit, greeting the little nubbin of pleasure and
sucking on it gently.</p>

<p>Buffy breathed in sharply, closing her eyes against the white hot pleasure
that invaded her senses.  &quot;Just a little...more.&quot;  she gasped, feeling her
lover increase the suction on her clit as her fingers increased their tempo.
  She felt it coming...coming relentlessly, like a freight train about to
bowl her over.  Her heart felt like it was about ready to jump right out of
her chest, and a mantra of 'oh god's' had started running pel mel through
her brain.  Then the pleasure washed over her and the thinking stopped, as
well as her breathing, and she couldn't tell for sure, but she could swear
her heart beat had stopped too, as the intense searing rush made her want to
cry out to the heavens.  She couldn't hear nor feel anything but the
pleasure for a few timely moments, and then her breathing came back with a
slight
gasp, and she felt her heart beat again, sending blood rushing to all of the
parts that so desperately needed it.</p>

<p>Her head was spinning, she presumed from lack of oxygen, and she felt limp
all over, but when Willow crawled up to lay her head on her shoulder she
realized that she'd never felt so good, just being alive.</p>

<hr>

<p>Joyce was about to go in to the showers herself about ten minutes later,
when both girls came out, dressed in their gym clothes, and looking rosy and
healthy, except for Willow, who apparently had a split lip.  Joyce was on
her in a second, searching for any more injuries.  &quot;I'm so sorry...did that
happen tonight...&quot;  Willow sent a panicked look Buffy's way, looking for a
helping hand, or at least a reasonable explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Mrs. Summers.&quot;  Cordelia said, glibly from
her spot on the unburned books.  &quot;It doesn't look like their feeling all
that badly to me...in fact...I think they enjoyed it.&quot;  Cordelia said,
before she got up and walked out, leaving them all
speechless. Willow's eyes turned big as saucers, while Buffy started
coughing spasmodically, earning a worried frown from her mother.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure you don't want to be checked out, Buffy?&quot;  Joyce asked,
frowning as Buffy continued coughing while waving her away.</p>

<p>&quot;Take it from me, Mrs. Summers.  Buffy's the picture of health...if you
looked up health in the Dictionary, there Buffy would be.  I know...cause
I've already checked her out...in a purely medical way of course...like
there'd be...any other way to check her out...right?
And you know me...I know stuff...and all her stuff checks out. Yep...she
works good...really good, even.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy eyed her lover, not knowing if she was making things better or worse.
&quot;Uh...you know...I think it's Willow that you need to worry about mom.  See
how red she is?  She came...you know,*real* close to losing it earlier...&quot;
Willow shot Buffy an evil look for that. &quot;...and before it gets any worse, I
think I oughta take her home.&quot;  Buffy continued in a hurry.  Yeah, home,
where they could pick up where they left off...a smile tried to break out on
the Slayer's face, but she forced it back, blinking at her mom innocently.
Joyce just
shook her head, and sighed, leading the way out of the school.</p>
