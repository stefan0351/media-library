<P>Man I hate birthdays!</P>
<P>For the second year in a row, my birthday turned out to be a nightmare.&nbsp; Last year at this time, my first (and last, I swear!) sexual encounter with Angel robbed him of his soul, and created my greatest enemy, the monster Angelus.</P>
<P>And yesterday, on my big One-Eight, the Watcher’s Council forced me to face a psychotic vamp named Krelik, minus my Slayer powers.&nbsp; They made Giles pump me full of some muscle relaxant, while Krelik kidnapped my mother.&nbsp; Giles ended up rebelling against the Council, who fired him.&nbsp; They’re now sending a new Watcher in his place, and expect me to follow his lead.</P>
<P>Yeah, they expect me to follow him.&nbsp; Yeah right!&nbsp; They don’t know this but I have no intention of following the Council ever again.&nbsp; They betrayed me, they used Giles against me.&nbsp; As far as I’m concerned, they’re as much the enemy as any vampire.</P>
<P>Anyway, all I wanted to do, after the Scoobs and Mom threw me a quickie birthday party, was crawl into my bed and fall asleep.</P>
<P>Turned out to be easier than I thought.&nbsp; And more fun.&nbsp; Somehow I was expecting to have a nightmare with Krelik in a starring role.&nbsp; I half-expected to see him terrorizing Mom and me again.</P>
<P>Instead, I found myself having one of the most erotic dreams I ever had.&nbsp; I was sunbathing on a deserted stretch of beach, completely nude, when I felt something burrow against my groin.&nbsp; When I opened my eyes, there she was, my goddess, my lover, my Willow.&nbsp; She had her head between my legs, her tongue performing its magic on my most sensitive spots…Oh yeah, this is my kind of dream.&nbsp; I didn’t move… I couldn’t move…Hell, who wants to move under these circumstances?</P>
<P>The dream faded, and I found myself awakening.&nbsp; Man, what a let down!</P>
<P>Or was it?&nbsp; Those strange sensations were still there, that familiar and welcome wetness between my legs, that tingling in my clitoris.&nbsp; I leaned my head forward and saw Willow’s hair over my groin, her tongue firmly planted in place.&nbsp; Oh yeah, she was going at it like there was no tomorrow!&nbsp; It didn’t take her long to send me down the road to Orgasm-land.&nbsp; Ooh yeah!&nbsp; You can wake me up like that any day, Willow!</P>
<P>The very first thing I was aware of, once the afterglow of my orgasm faded, was the fact that I wasn’t on my mattress.&nbsp; My back was flat against a hard, laminated surface.&nbsp; Okay, something’s odd here.&nbsp; I tried to stretch, but I couldn’t move my arms.&nbsp; That got me up.&nbsp; I managed to lift my head around, and noticed that I was lying on top of the kitchen table, my wrists and ankles tied to the table legs with silk scarves.&nbsp; Not too tight, so my circulation wasn’t being cut off, but just tight enough to keep me from moving.</P>
<P>"Ah, Sleeping Beauty awakens," I heard Willow’s voice but I couldn’t see her.&nbsp; I craned my head around to find her, but she had ducked out of my line of sight.&nbsp; </P>
<P>"Willow?" I asked.&nbsp; "Where are you?&nbsp; I mean, thanks for the wake-up call, but what’s with the bondage fetish?&nbsp; Something I should know about you?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, right," I could hear her voice, the vocal equivalent of sleigh bells in my ears, laughing at my plight.&nbsp; "Who do you think I am, Willow Rosenberg, Mistress of Pain?"&nbsp; She finally leaned forward from my left side, and I could see her face clearly.&nbsp; She was sporting a canary-eating grin, and as she looked at me, I felt that I was next on her menu.</P>
<P>"First, I didn’t tie you that tight.&nbsp; Second, I’m not normally in to bondage, it’s just that I wanted to experiment with something…different."</P>
<P>Different.&nbsp; Talk about your famous last words!</P>
<P>"Uh, you realize that Mom’s probably…" I started, then it occurred to me that the sunlight coming through the window at an odd angle.&nbsp; "Uh, what time is it anyway?&nbsp; And where is Mom?"</P>
<P>"It’s eleven-thirty-six," she answered as she checked her watch.&nbsp; I could have hit my head, if my hands weren’t tied.&nbsp; "I’m guessing that whatever the Council had Giles pump into you is still working, which is why I had to, uh, resort to drastic measures to wake you up, but he told me that it should wear off by the end of the day.&nbsp; As for your mom, she said something about the gallery calling her in to cover for someone who called in sick."</P>
<P>"Mm-hm.&nbsp; Okay, Willow.&nbsp; Fun’s fun, but you can untie me now, okay?&nbsp; Willow?"&nbsp; She quietly stepped out of the kitchen, leaving me tied up.&nbsp; Literally.</P>
<P>"Okay, Willow, joke’s over!&nbsp; Let’s untie the Slayer now!"&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; "WILLOW!"</P>
<P>Okay, I was getting a little nervous.</P>
<P>"Easy, Buffy," I heard her voice from the bathroom.&nbsp; "It’s Saturday, your mom’s not here, and we have all afternoon."&nbsp; I could have sworn I heard a wicked laugh from the bathroom, one that sounded suspiciously like Willow.</P>
<P>Okay, now I’m starting to panic.</P>
<P>Willow’s face emerged from the doorway, a warm reassuring smile on her face.&nbsp; Somehow I didn’t feel warm and reassured.&nbsp; "Please, Buffy," she pleaded, as she emerged in my line of sight.&nbsp; She was sporting a sexy green teddy, one that accentuated her curves quite nicely.&nbsp; Okay, maybe a little warm.&nbsp; "I’m not going to hurt you.&nbsp; I’m not going to do anything that would upset you."&nbsp; She walked around the table, stopping directly in front of my spread legs.&nbsp; Okay, this could be an interesting afternoon.&nbsp; But what was she carrying behind her back?</P>
<P>"Last night, Giles talked to me about what the Council forced him to do to you," she explained, as her hand gently rested on my knee.&nbsp; A faint shiver went up the inside of my leg.&nbsp; "He believed that one of the reasons the Council made him hit you with that muscle relaxant was so that you would lose your ability to trust.&nbsp; He was worried about what effect the whole rite of passage thing would do to you.&nbsp; So I told him and your mom that I’d spend some time with you today.&nbsp; Y’know, make sure you’re okay."</P>
<P>Yeah, right.&nbsp; "And what part of ‘making sure I’m okay’ involves the bondage stuff?"</P>
<P>Willow just smirked at me.&nbsp; "Think of this as an exercise in trust.&nbsp; Do you trust me, Buffy?"</P>
<P>"Uh, maybe you should ask me that when my hands are free."&nbsp; Willow just stuck her tongue out at me.&nbsp; "Okay, Willow, I trust you."</P>
<P>Willow smiled, running a finger along the inside of my thigh.&nbsp; Tiny electric sparks flew off where her finger met my skin.&nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; Because today I want you to be completely open to me; to put yourself entirely in my hands.&nbsp; That’s why the silk scarves.&nbsp; You won’t be able to touch me, or to escape my touch."</P>
<P>"And I’m assuming that…touching…is going to play a big part of all this?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah!"&nbsp; She finally pulled out the objects she had behind her back.&nbsp; She showed me the double-blade razor I use on my legs, and a can of shaving cream.&nbsp; "I’m going to do something I’ve wanted to do for some time now.&nbsp; And for this to work, I need you to lie absolutely still.&nbsp; Do you trust me?"</P>
<P>I started to understand what she had in mind, and I felt a strange mix of trepidation and desire.&nbsp; I was a little scared of what she had in mind, but at the same time incredibly thrilled.&nbsp; "I trust you, Willow."</P>
<P>She didn’t say anything; she just grinned again.&nbsp; When did she acquire this boldness, this sudden confidence?&nbsp; Was I somehow responsible?&nbsp; Whatever it was, I found it very attractive in her.&nbsp; And very arousing.</P>
<P>She pulled out a terry cloth hand towel, and placed it on the table, just under my seat.&nbsp; "Don’t want your mom to find any telltale signs when she’s making dinner, do we?"&nbsp; She then popped the lid off the shaving cream can, and dispensed a large dollop of aloe-scented cream on her hand.&nbsp; She dabbed the cream directly on my pubic region.&nbsp; The cream felt chilly against my skin, and I shivered, not so much from the cool cream on my vagina, but from the anticipation of what Willow was going to do next.</P>
<P>"Now, then," she purred gently.&nbsp; "I need you to stay still.&nbsp; Like a rock, Buffy, got it?"</P>
<P>"Got it," I whispered.&nbsp; Hurry, Willow, I’m getting so turned on now…</P>
<P>Willow put the can down and picked up the razor.&nbsp; "Trust me, Buffy," she cooed.&nbsp; "This is gonna look beautiful."&nbsp; She held the razor in her hand, and lowered it over the lathered flesh.&nbsp; I felt a faint scraping over my skin, as she navigated the razor over my groin.&nbsp; She used short, gentle strokes, taking her time in order to avoid any nicks.&nbsp; She was especially careful around my pussy lips, taking her time.&nbsp; This had the added effect of heightening my arousal, but I didn’t dare move.&nbsp; Don’t want any nicks in that area.</P>
<P>"Okay, all done," Willow suddenly announced.&nbsp; She started dabbing the excess shaving cream away with the towel, and then produced a mirror.&nbsp; She tilted the mirror so I could take a look at my newly shaven pubic region.&nbsp; The skin around my vagina was now as smooth as silk.&nbsp; I wanted to touch it right then and there, but Willow did a thorough job of keeping me tied.</P>
<P>"There we are," Willow purred dreamily, admiring her handiwork.&nbsp; "Good enough to eat.&nbsp; Which fits my ultimate plans…"</P>
<P>"Now that I can get behind," I announced.&nbsp; Willow smiled at me, then ducked away again.&nbsp; "Uh, Willow, when does the eating me out start?"</P>
<P>"Patience, Buffy, patience."&nbsp; I could hear cabinet doors open and close.&nbsp; She was puttering about the kitchen, and I could catch brief fleeting glimpses of her as I lay on the table.&nbsp; An occasional flash of her breast under green silk, a blur of red hair.&nbsp; What was she doing?</P>
<P>She suddenly leaned toward me from my right, her left hand gently brushing against my side.&nbsp; "Maybe for this next part, I’d better slip into something more comfortable.&nbsp; Like nothing."&nbsp; She slowly peeled the teddy off of her body, unveiling the gentle curves of her breasts.&nbsp; "There we are," she announced as she stood, naked and sexy as Hell, before me.&nbsp; </P>
<P>"Now, let’s have some fun."&nbsp; She showed me what she had collected from the kitchen.&nbsp; First she opened a bottle of chocolate syrup, opened the cap and squeezed.&nbsp; A stream of chocolate trailed down my neck, over my breasts where she looped syrup over my nipples, down my torso, into my bellybutton, and down my crotch.&nbsp; She then did the same with a bottle of caramel topping, and strawberry syrup.&nbsp; I glanced down and saw sweet sticky trails all over my body.&nbsp; Then she pulled out a can of whipped cream, and sprayed dollops of cream over my nipples and vagina.&nbsp; The sudden coolness made me shiver again.&nbsp; She was decorating me like a cake.&nbsp; And now she was ready to feast.</P>
<P>"Hey, don’t I get a cherry on top?" I grinned.</P>
<P>She smirked back at me.&nbsp; "I thought you lost your cherry last year."</P>
<P>"How about yours?"</P>
<P>"Does tampon application count?"&nbsp; I shook my head.&nbsp; Anything, just do this!&nbsp; Do me!</P>
<P>"Mm-hm," Willow purred as she leaned forward, and climbed on top of me on the table.&nbsp; "My favorite flavors…chocolate…" she licked my left breast, "strawberry…" she murmured against my collarbone, "caramel…" she nuzzled against my neck, licking up sweet syrup all the way, "and Buffy."&nbsp; She claimed my lips with her own, plundering my mouth with her tongue.&nbsp; I tasted the syrup on her tongue, and felt her body sliding against mine, getting all that sticky sweetness over both of us.</P>
<P>She lifted her body up, straddling me, displaying her candy-coated body in all its splendor.&nbsp; I was straining at the ties that held me on the table, desperate to kiss, fondle, taste this incredible woman on top of me.&nbsp; "Hmm," she cooed over me.&nbsp; "I seem to have gotten all sticky.&nbsp; Maybe we need more chocolate?"&nbsp; She picked up the chocolate bottle and poured it slowly over her breasts, coating the nipples.&nbsp; She let it drizzle down over her belly and into her thighs.&nbsp; "You like this, huh?"</P>
<P>"Yes," I was barely capable of sophisticated speech at this time.&nbsp; "Yes, I like."</P>
<P>"You want to taste this on me, don’t you?"&nbsp; She was enjoying teasing me, the little minx.&nbsp; It’s the shy ones you gotta watch out for!</P>
<P>"Yesss…" I breathed.&nbsp; I wanted her so desperately at that moment.</P>
<P>"Then I’d better let you have me, hadn’t I?"&nbsp; She squirmed a little, getting off of me, and slowly crawled on the table, until her knees were on either side of my head.&nbsp; I could see her clitoris directly over me, chocolate dripping off of her thighs and onto my face.&nbsp; I licked my lips, tasting chocolate, wanting to taste so much more.</P>
<P>"I think that the technical term for this," she murmured as she leaned over my body, her lovely ass lowering itself over my face, "is sixty-nine."</P>
<P>"My new lucky number…" I started to say, until her vagina muffled me.&nbsp; From then on, all verbal communication was reduced to inarticulate moans and grunts.</P>
<P>I feasted on her pussy-lips, licking the chocolate off of them, savoring the sweet cocoa flavor mixed with Willow’s own unique taste.&nbsp; I couldn’t decide which was sweeter, but the two tastes complimented each other so well.&nbsp; Chocolate-covered Willow.&nbsp; There might be a market for that.&nbsp; Especially with what’s at the delicious center.</P>
<P>Willow was not wasting any time on my creamy nougat center either.&nbsp; She was lapping at my clit like a cat at a bowl of cream.&nbsp; And with that area newly shorn, there was no hair getting in between her face and my sex.&nbsp; She dove in entirely, zeroing in on that little nubbin of sensation, attacking it with her tongue.&nbsp; She gently guided her hands under my ass, and parted my cheeks with her fingers.&nbsp; Her nose was rubbing just inside my vagina as her tongue lapped around my clit.&nbsp; I squirmed, bucked and jolted with each touch, but she hung on, honing in on my desire.&nbsp; Her own pussy rested on my lips, and I latched onto it, not letting it out of my reach.&nbsp; With my hands unable to reach her, to hold her down, I had to move my head around to keep up with her gyrations, but I managed to keep my lips affixed to her wet sticky pussy.</P>
<P>She started to part my lower lips with her fingers, gently circling my clitoral hood with her thumbs while she lapped at me.&nbsp; That was all I needed to push me over the edge, but I was taking her with me.&nbsp; I nipped and licked at her nub with renewed passion, and was rewarded by her cries of joy, muffled by my newly shaven crotch.&nbsp; She sped up her efforts, and within ten seconds, we were both thrashing in the throws of powerful orgasms.</P>
<P>Once the wave of sensations died down, my limbs were like putty.&nbsp; Even if I weren’t tied to the table, I wouldn’t be able to move.&nbsp; Willow somehow managed to rotate her body on top of me, so she was now facing me.&nbsp; She began to kiss me, and I kissed her back.&nbsp; We licked each other’s faces clean, enjoying the heady mix of dessert toppings and our own juices mixed together.&nbsp; Voice of experience time here, there are very few things more sensual and sexy than tasting yourself on the face of your lover.</P>
<P>We lay together in incredible afterglow, before my feet started to tingle.&nbsp; "Uh, Willow," I complained slightly, "I hate to say this, but I think my foot’s asleep."</P>
<P>Willow just looked at me briefly before she started to chuckle.&nbsp; "You want me to kiss it and make it better?"</P>
<P>"Kiss my foot," I mused, "what kind of fetishist are you?" I could barely see her blush under the chocolate that still stained her face.</P>
<P>"Ooh, poor baby," she muttered.&nbsp; "Here," she slid down my body, sticking a little where the dessert toppings were drying, and started to untie the scarves that held my feet down.&nbsp; She then walked around the table and untied my wrists.&nbsp; I started to stretch, which Willow was observing with heightened interest.&nbsp; I was preparing to pay her back for her little experiment.&nbsp; Now that I had my hands back, I planned to use them, very soon.</P>
<P>"Hey, Buffy," she grinned at me, "Maybe we should clean up a little.&nbsp; We’re still pretty sticky."</P>
<P>"Well," I purred, "the upstairs shower is big enough for two."&nbsp; We raced each other upstairs, and proceeded to get very wet(in more ways than one).</P>
<P>We just managed to get showered up (we finally left the shower after the hot water was exhausted!), and clean the table and kitchen floor before Mom got home.&nbsp; When she poured us some root beer and asked Willow if she wanted to stay for dinner, Willow just flashed me a secret smile, and said, "No thanks, Mrs. Summers, just ate."&nbsp; I nearly choked on my root beer, but Mom didn’t seem to notice.</P>
<P>Yep, it’s the shy ones you gotta watch out for.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I was learning to like birthdays.</P>
