<p>It was after a brief snowball fight; that had demonstrated the
truth behind the phrase 'Mutually Assured Destruction' that lead to
the events herafter known between the two as 'Living Room Lovin' on
that particular Christmas day.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot believe you played such a mean trick on me Willow.&quot;
Buffy said stepping out of the shower. </p>

<p>The redhead in question was standing in front of the mirror,
her hair wrapped up in a towel, her body likewise, much to the
Slayer's dissapoinment. </p>

<p>Without turning around Willow responded to Buffy's complaints.
&quot;Why not?&quot; She asked. &quot;You've got all those ..Slayer thingies going
for you so the only way I could get a guarenteed hit in was by shoving
the snowball down the back of your shirt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn't talking about that Will.&quot; Buffy said getting her own
towel. She shook out her hair, being mindfull not to accidently whip
the redhead with it.</p>

<p>'She might enjoy it.' Buffy thought. ' Or I might. Ooh. Bad
thoughts. Bad thoughts!'</p>

<p>&quot;So what was so unfair then?&quot; She didn't turn around fast
enough to get more than a glimpse as the Blonde wrapped her body in a
fluffy white towel. 'Well, we'll see how long that lasts.' The redhead
mused. 'Sheesh, sex, sex, sex, sex…is that all I think about?……..Yup.'</p>

<p>&quot;I'm referring to when, as I was trying to prevent the snow
from sliding down the crack of my ass, you shaking the tree branch
dumping a bunch of more snow on me.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The…hum..er..do..Buffy,&quot; Willow reached out and put her hand
on the bare shoulder of the Slayer turning her around. Placing her
other hand on Buffy's other shoulder she stepped dangerously close.
&quot;Do you have any idea how many innduendoes you're leaving yourself
open too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmmm.&quot; Buffy smiled back, with exaggerated gestures she
coyly put a finger to her pursed lips. &quot;I dunno. Maybe I'm doing it on
purpose?&quot; She raised her own arms to snare the redhead's waist. Eyes
closed their faces moved together to heal the playful rift with that
end all, be all, of cures.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, nothing interupted them. </p>

<p>For a while.</p>

<p>As soft lips nibbled at each other and fingers strayed closer
and closer to risky territory, as blood pressures rose and pulse rates
accelerated, as hearts began to pound and breath began to rasp, as
tounges did play and desires rose while as mental capabilities
plummeted; that's when fate played a dirty card.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy? Willow? Hot chocolates ready!&quot; Joyce Summers shouted
up the stairs. </p>

<p>Buffy sighed pulling away from Willow.  'Just as well,' The
Slayer thought to herself. 'We were really losing it. Though, if it
were an option I wouldn't want to lose it, I'd happily throw it out
the window.' Her eyes still closed Willow tried to follow Buffy, her
lips still seeking out just a few seconds longer of purchase. </p>

<p>Buffy intercepted the move with two fingers gently pressed
againt the wiccan's lips; it was supposed to be an attempt to let
Willow down gently, but when Willow's lips themselves eased over the
offered fingers and began gently nursing on the digits, Buffy's knees
nearly buckled. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh..christ. Willow!&quot; The gasp escaped unbidden &quot;C'mon
lover..we gotta stop.&quot;</p>

<p>Releasing the fingers from their sweet, sweet, confinment
Willow momentarily pouted. &quot;Say that again.&quot; She whimpered.</p>

<p>&quot;Say what?&quot; Buffy asked confused. </p>

<p>&quot;Your eyebrows scrunch up in the cutest way.&quot; Willow exclaimed
competley off topic.  She shook her head briefly. &quot;Say it again.&quot; She
whined. &quot;Call me that again. Please?&quot; She assulted Buffy with her
puppy dog look. Green eyes shrouded by half her eyelids, bending over
just a teensy bit so she could peer forlonrly up at her blonde
counterpart.</p>

<p>Buffy got it.</p>

<p>She smiled, a slow, small, sexy smile with just the right
amount of light in her eyes. Shimmering, moving, light danced saying
'come to me, I'll make everything worthwhile.' Her lips said a
diffrent message but one no less welcom.</p>

<p>&quot;Lover.&quot; Buffy whispered. &quot;Lover mine, we have go. Mommy's
calling lover mine.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's eyes slowly closed and a slight hum echoed from the
back of her throat. She slid her arms around the Slayer's waist as the
blonde, in turn, embrace her. &quot;Lover?&quot; She squeaked.</p>

<p>&quot;You betcha.&quot; Buffy replied with a small laugh. &quot;Best one yet,
and your rating on bestedness has nothing to do with not being
currrrsseeed.&quot; She drawled.</p>

<p>&quot;Currssseeed?&quot; Willow giggled. &quot;Speakensie good english?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yah. Fer sure.&quot; Buffy replied with an exagerated 'vally girl'
accent.</p>

<p>The sexual tension between the two dimished to bearable levels
from the humor and it was with only passing reluctance that they
finished drying off with the occasional caress and not the fevered
contact so despretely wanted moments before.</p>

<p>&quot;Girls? The choclate is getting cold!&quot; Joyce called again.</p>

<p>&quot;Second Mom!&quot; Buffy hollared back. &quot;Not less you want us
cavorting about naked or anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Joyce didn't rise to the bait.</p>

<p>&quot;Cavorting?&quot; Willow questioned again with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. We cavort. I seek nothing but a thorough cavorting as
soon as possible.&quot; Buffy grinned.</p>

<p>&quot;A cavort eh?&quot; Willow donned a yellow and red 'SunnyDale High'
sweatshirt. 'The night cannot get here soon enough.' Willow thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Massive cavorts&quot; Buffy nodded putting on her own T-shirt.
'The night cannot get here soon enough.' Buffy thought.</p>

<hr>

<p>The two young women, wrapped in fuzzy blankets, were sitting
on the sofa. The living room table itself was decked with the remains
of wrapping paper and half empty mugs of tepid chocoloate. </p>

<p>Willow was stetched across the entire length of the sofa while
Buffy was reclining against Willow's belly. Most of her weights was
resting on her arms which were spread on the back of the sofa so
Willow's wasn't too uncomfortable. </p>

<p>Joyce herself had just returned from the kitchen after zapping
her own mug of chocolate in the microwave. She sat down in the easy
chair that was angled just right so unless she turned her head, she
couldn't see the sofa. </p>

<p>All three ladies were paying rapt attention to the television,
three sets of eyes paid absolute attention as a young lad, in the role
of 'Tiny Tim' lept about the room hollaring 'God bless us, every one.'
every few seconds.</p>

<p>Correction.Two sets of eyes were paying attention. One, those
green in colors were paying more attention to the blonde before her.
Mischief glinted in her vision and the begining of an idea, part love,
part lust and a good helping of 'payback' as well. </p>

<p>'Why not?' The redhead decided. 'Turnabout is fair play but
it's Christmas. If you believe in Christmas and..no, I have to fit
in.. and..oh that's right! Christmas! Tis better to give than recieve.
Great! I'm such a giver. I like being generous!'</p>

<p>As Ebeneezer Scrooge raised a toast on the television, and no
one was paying attention to her in the slightest, the redhead
steathily moved a hand under her blanket, under the border of the
blondes own fuzzy wrapping and slowly ran the tip of one finger along
the curved, tone, flesh she found under there. </p>

<p>The blonde didn't even twitch,exhibiting far too much self
control for such a give away. Willow's finger, just the middle one,
the very tip of it, continually eased around and around the same area,
the same curve of skin. It took a few minutes of attention but finally
a reaction was seen. Buffy stretched lazily, arms above her head with
a somewhat exageratted yawn. Then she eased herself back and lay down
so she was, in a friendly way, now spooned by Willow's reclining form. </p>

<p>Their bodies were still several inches apart, anyone who
walked in would not have been to surprised, two women marely
being..comfy. Under the blankets..that was different.  </p>

<p>Willow had not lost contact with the Slayer as she lay down,
in fact, now that she was lying on her side. She moved the flat of her
palm over the smooth, warm, skin. Wrapping her fingers over the curve
of one of Buffy's cheeks.</p>

<p>&quot;Sssss...&quot; Buffy hissed. She didn't turn around but quietly
whispered. &quot;Willow, what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>Supporting her head with one hand, in turn supported by her
elbow Willow smiled over Buffy's shoulder, still prentending to watch
the television. Under the covers she was sliding her fingertips along
the curves that lead inward, up along thighs and then back out again.
She could feel Buffy's flesh begining to get goosebumpy in an
instictual desire to feel, expierence more. </p>

<p>&quot;Remember the Bronze?&quot; Willow whispered with just enough
volume to carry her words to the Slayers ears mere inches away and no
more. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm positive I didn't hear that right.&quot; Buffy had to clench
her teeth at the feelings bouncning around in her skull. 'She
wouldn't!'</p>

<p>&quot;I said,&quot; Willow whispered again, &quot;Remember the Bronze?&quot; She
dipped her head quickly and gave a mini-nip to Buffy's earlobe. </p>

<p>&quot;I..barely remember my last name.&quot; Buffy hissed.</p>

<p>'I'mintrouble!' She decided at that very second. 'I..like
trouble.'</p>

<p>Unseen by anyone, Buffy's hand dangling of the edge of the
sofa curled into claws and began digging into the carpeting.</p>

<p>&quot;Payback's a bitch.&quot; Willow smiled. Her fingertips were now
gracing the area where the begining of the blondes panties began.
Dancing along the edge of material and skin, lower..and lower along
the line of clothing. </p>

<p>Joyce Summers was flipping the channels. 'A Christmas Tale'
was over.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh look, they're showing 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas.'
Should I leave it here girls?&quot; She asked without turning around.</p>

<p>&quot;Yuppers.&quot; Willow exclaimed loudly. &quot;Gotta love that Grinch,
and those no nonsese Who's down in Whos-ville.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who's..who?&quot; Buffy stuttered. Willow had bent one knee urging
the Slayer to do the same, and she had. This gave Willow
more....space.</p>

<p>Her fingers had eased under the line of Buffy's panties but
she didn't press the issue. Being content to just move the tips of her
fingers up..and down..along the same stretch of previously covered
flesh over and over again. Still along the same curve and never too
close to Buffy's arousal. Buffy wasn't aware of it but she was
pressing back against Willow's legs with her own. The redhead could
feel the tension in the Slayer's muscles; a sure sign of Buffy
arousal.</p>

<p>Nudging the back of the blonde's knees one last time gave her
space enough to move her hand freely. She was laying on her side,
Buffy was, one hand still sunk into the plush carpeting. Her breathing
seemed slow and even, nothing irregular there but underneath the
covers her legs were twitching. </p>

<p>'Okay, here we go.' Willow thought to herself. 'I can't ..no,
enough can't believing stuff. I can believe I'm doing this, I just
hope we don't get caught. Something is very wrong with me...' She slid
her hand under the material that covered Buffy and moved one finger
along her lips. Buffy yanked her hand to her mouth and bit down on her
finger. Her eyes were squeezed shut and Willow wasn't sure she heard
the faint whimpers that Buffy was swallowing down, or merely just her
imagination. 'On the other hand, something is possibly very right.'
Willow thought moving her fingers, two now, between Buffy's lips, tip
top to bottom. </p>

<p>A slight tremor rumbled across the Slayer's body. 'Jeus!' Her
mind screamed. 'She's doing this, Willow is actully doing this right
here in front of...ah...aH...ah..bite down bite down! in front..of my
mother.'
Capabilities for thought were washed away as a fresh spasm of pleasure
drowned her mind. Willow had pressed three fingers, gently but firmly
at the top of Buffy's lips. Around, on and beside her clitoris. She
was moving the fingers in a slow, easy, circle. </p>

<p>'Cre..created a monster!' Buffy's drowning mind choked out
before being sumberged once more.</p>

<p>The television blared loudly through the room. One woman was
watching silently, another was not, but being silent, the third wasn't
watching it either and trying very, very hard to remain silent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm">Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the small,<br>
Was singing! Without any presents at all!<br>
He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming!<br>
IT CAME!<br>
Somehow or other, it came just the same! </p>

<p>'Not yet.' Willow thought sliding her wet fingers together,
feeling how drenched her entire hand had become. 'But pretty soon
now.'</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Summers?&quot; Willow spoke up. Buffy gave a giant jerk in
surprise but Willow kept sliding her fingers along, she moved her
entire hand into the crotch of Buffy's panties and flicked her thumb
along Buffy's clit briefly. The Slayer didn't budge. &quot;Can I get some
more hot chocolate?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure Willow.&quot; Joyce stood up and moved for the kitchen.</p>

<p>&quot;Now.&quot; Willow whispered and began nibbling on Buffy's ear
while slowly sliding a single finger inside, her thumb still dancing
it's merry rythm. Buffy's back arched and Willow had to wrap her free
arm around the Slayers shoulders to keep her on the sofa. Buffy's
hands grabbed Willow's arms and squeezed!</p>

<p>&quot;Quickly...quietly.&quot; Willow broke off nibbling for a second
before going right back at it.</p>

<p>&quot;Nnnnnnnn....&quot; Buffy began to whine.</p>

<p>&quot;It came without ribbons! It came without tags!&quot; The Grinch on
the television puzzled.</p>

<p>&quot;N..no..ribbons.&quot; Buffy gasped.</p>

<p>&quot;It came without packages, boxes or bags!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;packages..boxes....bad...&quot; Buffy groaned, whipping her head
back and forth under her lover's touch. </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe Christmas,&quot; The Grinch thought, &quot;doesn't come from a
store.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Coming! Willow...coming!&quot; Buffy squeaked around lips clenched
together. It was that or sink her teeth into Willow's arm. Her legs
snapped together around Willow's fingers and a massive shudder swept
along her body that nearly knocked Willow off. The redhead despretely
flung a leg around the Slayers own in an effort to prevent the two of
them from being dragged off the sofa.</p>

<p>Buffy's body shuddered violently once..then held still, only
the trembling of her lips and the rythmic pressure around Willow's
finger were any indicitaion of life. Another shudder, Willow hung on
for dear life, then a third and finally Buffy took a deep breath of
air and relaxed. </p>

<p>&quot;...oh.....God.&quot; Buffy whispered. She was coming down; Willow,
moving very slowly so as to prolong the pleasure, began murming sweet
nothings in her lover's ear.  &quot;Shhh....&quot; She whispered. &quot;Relax... Come
back...c'mon. I love you you know that, don't you?&quot; </p>

<p>Another shakey sigh and a lazy nod of her blonde head was the
only answer Willow recieved. </p>

<p>Slower her fingers moved...slower...in time with the Slayer's
breathing, which itself was getting deeper, slower...more
gentle...more relaxed. Finally it hit a low point, with even breaths
that told Willow everything she wanted to know. Buffy was asleep.</p>

<p> Willow gently pried Buffy's legs apart with her free hand and
eased the other one free of Buffy's panties. Smiling to herself she
kissed the back of Buffy's neck and pulled her closer as the blonde
instinctivly snuggled. </p>

<p>Joyce Summers walked back into the room with a tray on which
rested three fresh cups of cocoa. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh rats.&quot; She said staring at the closing credits of 'The
Grinch Who Stole Christmas'. &quot;Did I miss the end of the show?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy had fallen asleep and Willow begged off from getting the
new chocoloate drink by pointing out that doing so might wake Buffy
up.  Joyce was a bit grudging when it came to conceding the point as
meant two whole mugs of cocoa were going to go to waste but gave
ground eventually.</p>

<p>Some time passed. Television was watched, a Slayer did snooze
and Willow ubotrusivily let her hand dry. No one was really paying
attention, just enjoying the warmth of a home, surrounded by snow, in
the late afternoon of Christmas Day.</p>

<p>'This is nice.' Willow thought staring down at the slumbering
blonde. 'Really nice and homey. Young lesbian lovers on Christmas Day.
It's a painting Rockwell forgot to paint.' She snuck a look at Joyce
who, she was surprised too see, had also fallen into a light sleep.</p>

<p>'I wish night would get here.' Willow mentally grumbled. She
ground her legs together in a vain effort to relieve a bit of the
'itch'. 'I'm getting kinda antsy.'</p>

<p>The shrill screech of the telephone jarred those within from
their pituresque rest. Well, most of them. Willow jerked a bit and
Joyce blinked a few times before getting up to answer it. Buffy
herself rolled over a bit and snuggled closer to Willow mumbling &quot;I'll
take another serving please. From the breast, I like white meat.&quot;</p>

<p>'My hair is going to catch fire any minute now.' Willow
thought. She could feel her legs begining to tremble under the
blankets. Raw need was screaming in the deeper parts of her mind,
instinct ready to pounce and swallow up rationale whole. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, Willow,&quot; Joyce said rentering the living room. She
took one look at the scene before her, her daughter fast asleep,
cuddled up next to her best friend. Two sets of bare feet poking out
the bottom of the blankets. Willow glanced up and caught Joyce staring
at them. She did the only thing she could. </p>

<p>'If this doesn't work we are so busted.' She thought wildly.
Attempting to give a smile, that she was sure looked more than
slightly crazed, she shrugged helplessly. Joyce apparently accepted it
and put her fingers over her lips. She crossed the room silently.</p>

<p>&quot;That was a friend of mine in LA.&quot; Joyce stage whispered.
&quot;She's invited me up for a Christmas Party. Will you girls be okay for
the night?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Heh.&quot; Willow giggled..or tried too. &quot;Oh sure, sure I mean,
what's not to be fine about? I've got her, she's got me, no that came
out wrong what I meant to say is that we have each other no that
doesn't work. Yes! We'll be fine Mrs. Summers thank you for asking.&quot;
She paused.  &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>

<p>Joyce nodded slowly. 'I'm missing something here. I just know
it.' &quot;I'm fine..Willow. I'll see you two girls tommorow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes! Tommorow!&quot; Willow nodded firmly. &quot;As in, not today.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Willow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Mrs. Summers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Less sugar intake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Mrs. Summers.&quot;</p>

<p>The older woman smiled at ruffled the redhead's hair for a
second. &quot;Take care of my little girl.&quot; She smiled.</p>

<p>Willow's eyes nearly popped clean out their sockets. &quot;She's
not li..yes ma'am.&quot; Willow nodded. &quot;We'll be good.&quot; </p>

<p>'Liar, liar pants of fire.' Her mind sang. 'It's for a good
cause!' She argued back.</p>

<p>'Nose is as long as a telephone wire.' It persisted. 'Ooo. I'm
bad! I'm a bad, bad girl. I'm a bad, bad, horny..er..no. Oh..yikes!' </p>

<p>&quot;Willow are you alright?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep, yessiree, fine, right as rain..uh...comfortable even.&quot;
Willow paused again. &quot;How are you?&quot; She repeated before she could
catch it.</p>

<p>&quot;I meant it about the sugar.&quot; Joyce said standing back up.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell Buffy where I went when she wakes up okay?&quot; Joyce called
over her shoulder. She grabbed her coat of the hook and slipped it
over her shoulders. &quot;You two look cute together.&quot; She said smiling at
the girls on the sofa.</p>

<p>'You are about to die.' Willow's mind calmy informed her.
Oddly enough, with her apparent destiny so clear she found herself at
peace, and capable of actual thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Whole best friend thing right Mrs. Summers?&quot; She said easily.</p>

<p>&quot;Something like that.&quot; Joyce picked up her purse. &quot;You two
just seem to go well together, like...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chocolate sauce and ice cream?&quot; Willow interupted. 'Now you
really ARE going to die.' Her brain piped up.</p>

<p>&quot;I was..thinking more along the lines of Abbot and Costello.&quot;
Joyce says slowly.</p>

<p>&quot;But..but neither of us are fat!&quot; Willow protested. She pulled
her blanket up and peeked underneath quickly. &quot;I'm not fat! Am I?&quot;</p>

<p>Shaking her head slightly, but still smiling, Joyce said, &quot;Bye
Willow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bye Mrs. Summers.&quot; Willow replied as the front door closed
with a quiet click.</p>

<hr>

<p>The door shut, and Buffy didn't move.</p>

<p>Outside the engine of the Summers truck snarled to life and
Buffy didn't move.</p>

<p>The television commercials sang their Christmas jingles as the
sound of the truck faded away in the distance and still Buffy didn't
move.</p>

<p>Willow lay her head on the Slayer's shoulder and peacefully
watched the TV for about five minutes, then Buffy moved.</p>

<p>Exploding off the sofa she had scooped Willow up and flung the
startled redhead over her shoulder. Willow's sweatshirt slid up so her
panty covered ass was high in the air before the wiccan knew what the
hell was going on.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy!? What? Where?&quot; Willow gasped.</p>

<p>&quot;You are in so much trouble witch girl.&quot; Buffy growled
standing tall in the living room. Only the long edge of her T-Shirt
provided any modesty. If the living room curtains hadn't been closed,
anyone walking by would have gotten a good look at what appeared to be
FemWrestleFest Five-Thousand. </p>

<p>&quot;Trouble?&quot; Willow squeaked. &quot;Me? Why? What I do?&quot; All the
blood was rushing to her head and the Slayer's shoulder was digging
into her pelvis in a way that was not all competly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh you know why.&quot; Buffy grred, slapping the redhead's
asscheek playfully. &quot;Now it's my turn.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But..but..&quot; Willow yelped, the Slayer gave a short hop on the
balls of her feet, &quot;Ah! But..that was for the Bronze, turnabout, fair
play, stuff...revenge dish served cold, y'know? Hot your case though,
dish..serving..hotting..thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right.&quot; Buffy agreed breezing across the room with her
payload so she stood in front of the armchair her mother had so
recently vacated. &quot;So now it's my turn for revenge.&quot; With that said
she uncermoniously, but carefully, dumped the Willow into the chair.
Willow looked up with a very worried expression on the scowling
features of her lover.</p>

<p>&quot;I..I was only...&quot; She hiccuped. </p>

<p>Buffy slowly pushed the back of the chair down so the recliner
foot stool popped up lifting Willow's feet. </p>

<p>&quot;I know.&quot; Buffy said quietly. &quot;And you did. Boy did you ever!
But now I wanna play.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Play?&quot; Willow instantly relaxed a bit. She had thought she
really had messed up. &quot;So..so I didn't do anything wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Depends on your definition of wrong Will.&quot; Buffy smirked.
&quot;And right. That was very right though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you're gonna play now?&quot; Willow bubbled, stark relief was
plained evident on her face until she got another good look at the sly
glare Buffy was leveling at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Not...exactly.&quot; The Slayer smiled evily. </p>

<p>&quot;Uh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to watch.&quot; Buffy whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Watch? TV?&quot; Willow was confused.</p>

<p>&quot;Noooo..&quot; Buffy drawled out and leaned over the armrest
slowly, her T-shit slipped foward giving Willow quite a view. The
blondes lips were mere inches from Willow's ear. &quot;No.&quot; She whispered.
&quot;I want to watch you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Watch...me?&quot; Willow's lips began to tremble as her mind
stubbornly refused to understand what Buffy was refering too. &quot;Watch
me what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Play.&quot; Buffy licked the tip of Willow's ear.</p>

<p>Bing!</p>

<p>&quot;Ohnononononononono.&quot; It was only Buffy's attentions and her
soft hand on Willow's thigh that kept the redhead from lurching out of
the chair and clear across the room. </p>

<p>&quot;No way, uh uh, not gonna do that, gotta be joking, must be
joking tell me you're joking?&quot; She begged.</p>

<p>&quot;Sshhhh shhh...&quot; Buffy hushed stroking the hair on Willow's
head. &quot;Wigging out, not worth it Will. Am I asking too much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohhh...Oooo..You....errr..&quot; Willow fumed. She shook a finger
in the Slayer's face.  &quot;You betcha!&quot;
	A finger which Buffy immidiatly wrapped her lips around and
eased into her mouth all the way to it's base. A warm 'hummmmm' purred
from the back of her throat. Now it was Willow's turn to nearly
buckle. If she hadn't already been sitting, she would fallen over.</p>

<p>Nursing on Willow's finger for a short, short minute Buffy
slid her lips back up it's length, dragging her teeth softly the
entire way. &quot;You like?&quot; She hummed in Willow's ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Urk!&quot; Willow's jaw hung free. </p>

<p>&quot;You're so beautiful Willow.&quot; Buffy whispered, she spread
apart Willow's fingers taking the tip of a diffrent one in betwen each
sentence for a short nip with her teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;...sensual..&quot;</p>

<p>Bite.</p>

<p>&quot;..exotic..&quot;</p>

<p>Bite.</p>

<p>&quot;...I wanna see you baby...</p>

<p>Bite.</p>

<p>&quot;...All of you...&quot;</p>

<p>This time Buffy took Willow's pinky and ran her lips along
it's sides, smooth...slow..down.....and back. Stopping Buffy put
Willow's hand to her own chest, over the Slayer's heart while looking
at the redhead with puppy dog eyes. &quot;Please?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But..but..&quot; Willow gaped. &quot;I never..uhm..I mean..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never?&quot; Buffy questioned. &quot;Honestly? Truly?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow squirmed in her seat, the need was still chomping at
the bits but this was akward, so alkward she could feel it begining to
weaken. </p>

<p>&quot;Well..not often.&quot; She admitted.</p>

<p>Willow's heart was pounding in her chest, it felt like it was
pounding in her throat. She swallowed, swallowed again. Nope, still
couldn't breathe. Averting her eyes from Buffy's big
blue..shimmery...ones she studied her lap. </p>

<p>&quot;O..okay.&quot; She said. &quot;You can...er..I'll...&quot; She waved her
hand in the air nonsensically. &quot;Play.&quot;</p>

<p>'OhmyGod!' Willow's mind was drowning in panic. 'I'm gonna do
this? I can't do this, I can barely speak in public and now
I'm..but..I love her ..she loves me..still..oh..'</p>

<p>Trying to keep herself from trembling outwardly Willow slowly
picked her hands up and placed them on her thighs. The sensation
didn't feel too good, her palms were clammy and cold. Despite the heat
pervading the room from the fire her toes felt like ice. She couldn't
make herself look Buffy in the eye as she sat there.</p>

<p>For a few seconds Willow didn't move. She could feel Buffy's
presense just out of sight yet, for the first time in a long while
this brought no comfort. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy...I..&quot; She said quietly. </p>

<p>&quot;You don't have too.&quot; Buffy replied.</p>

<p>Buffy was not a stupid person. She had eyes and she knew
Willow very well. 'She can't do this.' Her mind had begun to insist.
'This wasn't a good idea and it could blow up in your face.' </p>

<p>She had felt the waves of anxiety that were pouring off the
redhead like a tide and had already decided to stop this no longer fun
game, before Willow had said anything..</p>

<p>At hearing Buffy 'release' her Willow slumped back into her
chair. 'I feel so stupid.' She mentally griped. 'It's not like we
havn't ..and she hasn't...seen me. That ..there isn't .. I hate my
brain. I can't even think it.' A hint of rebelious spirit in her mind
flashed a fang. 'We've made love! We..we've 'gone down' on each other.
We've had SEX! We've...we've even fucked!!' </p>

<p>That mental admittance completely bypassed Willow's common
sense gland and headed right for her mouth. Sitting bolt upright in
her chair Willow blurted out, &quot;Buffy we've fucked right?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy blinked a few times. &quot;Uh...technically...yes. Though I
prefer the more...refined term of lovemaking.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh me too.&quot; Willow nodded. &quot;Yay lovingmaking word. Boo
fucking term. I just needed to hear it. I mean..you know..to be sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Shaking her head slightly but still adoring Willow's behavior,
Buffy climbed into the big easy chair beside the redhead; Willow
scooted over to make room for her lover. The Slayer curled up next to
the witch, reaching up Buffy began stroking Willow's short, red, hair.

	&quot;Well baby,&quot; She crooned softly in Willow's ear. &quot;We've made
love, we've screwed, done the nasty...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn't nasty.&quot; Willow protested. &quot;It's far from nasty. So
far from nasty light from Nasty won't ever reach it..us..whatever.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy chuckled.  &quot;We've even pelvis danced.&quot; She was trailing
her fingers along Willow's hairline, following the conture from the
temple, back, behind the redhead's ears, feather light touches along
it's rim, before moving to lightly stroke the back of the witches
neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Some could argue,&quot; Buffy continued. &quot;That we've also boffed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Boffed.&quot; Willow giggled. </p>

<p>&quot;Close your eyes.&quot; Buffy murmered. She left a line of
lingering kisses from Willow's chin up to her ear. Willow closed her
eyes. Easing her hands down the redhead's sides she grabbed the
waistline of Willow's panties. &quot;Upsy daisey&quot; Buffy said.</p>

<p>Lifting herself off the chair for a second Willow allowed the
Slayer to slide down the last bit of clothing she had on, save her
oversized Sunnydale sweatshirt. Willow sank back onto the love seat,
'Love seat.' Her mind sang. 'If only they knew.' </p>

<p>Hooking one arm under Willow's knee's and the other behind her
shoulders Buffy lifted the redhead briefly, scooted to the center of
the chair and set the wiccan down on her lap. &quot;There.&quot; She said from
her position right behind the redhead's shoulder. &quot;Comfy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmmm...&quot; Willow purred, her head falling back to lean
against the Slayer's own. &quot;Very.&quot;</p>

<p>The cold that had plauged her was gone now, expunged from the
blazing fire that was her lover. A fire that, coincedintially, was
fueling some others within herself at the same time.</p>

<p>Her legs rested on top of Buffy's, her back to the Slayer's
front, a perfect meshing of two people. Front to back, bottom to the
other's top. &quot;Give me your hands baby.&quot; Buffy urged. &quot;Hold them up for
me.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow complied and Buffy rested her own hand on top of
Willow's own, perfectly even. Pushing slightly she guided Willow's
hands to rest atop her own thighs being very careful it was only
Willow's fingers actually touching her own flesh.</p>

<p>Guiding Willow's hands with her own she slid the redhead's own
fingertips over her own thighs. Down, back, smooth and warm slow and
above all, patient. Willow crooned, still resting her head on the
Slayer's shoulder she purred, wimpered and giggled as the seeping heat
strung along her nerves. </p>

<p>&quot;Haaaa...&quot; She sighed. &quot;So warm now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Warm is good.&quot; Buffy replied. &quot;Warm and loving eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Loving, could go for loving all day.&quot; Willow mumbled.</p>

<p>&quot;We have all day. All day, all night. All Christmas.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All Chanakah would be better.&quot; Willow smiled, eyes still
shut. &quot;Eight whole days y'know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sheesh. You're insatiable!&quot; Buffy kissed the back of Willow's
neck.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll satiate me...someday.&quot; Willow laughed quietly. &quot;Nuff
talking, satiating needed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cavorting?&quot; Buffy whispered in a naughty voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Cavort me baby.&quot; Willow replied. </p>

<p>&quot;Bad girl.&quot; Buffy laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Darn tootin'.&quot; Willow whispered.</p>

<p>The blonde resumed guiding the redhead's fingers over her own,
now burning, skin. She was waiting, the blonde was, moving the fingers
of her love over and over, down and back, up and over, again and
again. She was waiting, and she was patient. She could wait, she would
wait for...</p>

<p>As her guided ministrations ran Willow's fingers nearer and
nearer to her own waist the witch's legs twitched. That was what Buffy
had been waiting for. Not ceasing the movements of her hands Buffy
slowly spread her legs, Willow's own, resting atop the Slayers, moved
along in agreement. Buffy guided Willow's own hands to the inside of
her own thighs, tracing, touching, sliding closer and nearer to the
redhead's lips before moving away again.</p>

<p>Willow's murmers of pleasure were begining to take a turn
toward the frustrated. </p>

<p>&quot;Nooo.&quot; She whined as Buffy's hands forced her own away yet
again. Then her breath caught in her throat as again the touches came
moving back up along the inside; when, at the last second, they veered
aside, up over her thighs, to her waist and over her belly she
protested with a quiet wail. </p>

<p>&quot;You... big meanie!&quot; She whispered pouting with her eyes still
shut. </p>

<p>Buffy said nothing just moving Willow's hands back down in the
direction the redhead most wanted to go. Again she forced Willow to
move around and over to the insides of her thighs. Willow groaned
slightly but said nothing. Buffy could feel Willow's hands trying to
pull away, to pull up where Willow wanted and not follow the course
set by the Slayer's demands. She gave way grudginly,
slowly....sloooowwwllyyy..allowing Willow to pull Buffy's hands for a
change where the redhead desired.  She didn't stop the redhead, but
did slow her down.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Willow said as their joined hands moved ever, and ever
closer. &quot;Oh....oh...&quot; each time in a higher pitched voice.</p>

<p>Her own fingers touched her and the great yelp of pleasure
burst from between her lips shattering the stillness of the afternoon,
though neither of them cared, or noticed. Willow's back arched just a
bit and her lips opened and shut in silent response. Feeling had
overridden everything in her mind, feeling and need.</p>

<p>She moved her fingers slowly, around, along, within, and
without. From the top to the bottom and back again. She could feel her
heartbeat again, now it was racing and hungry. Need was hungry and in
time with her heady desire Willow pleasured herself. Because she was
not even aware that Buffy had removed her own hands from atop of
Willow's. She wasn't aware that Buffy was now embracing her from
behind, one arm pulling the redhead's head back so she could whisper
encouragement into her lover's ear. The other had pulled the wiccan's
sweatshirt up and Buffy was carressing, gently kneading Willow's right
breast. </p>

<p>&quot;Don't hold it in.&quot; Buffy whispered. &quot;C'mon baby. Feel it.
C'mon.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow was pressing back against Buffy, then would arch away
only to push back again. </p>

<p>&quot;Nnnn....Mmmm...&quot; Willow gasped out between open lips. Her
pelvis hunching foward to meet her own touch. Buffy began nuzzling the
redhead's neck while always, always whispering.</p>

<p>&quot;That's it...go ..go on...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Willow nodded. &quot;Uh huh..uh huh...mmm...&quot; Again she
arched away from the Slayer's back but into her caressing hands. Buffy
moved her other hand down Willow's body so she now was lovingly
stroking both of the redhead's breasts.</p>

<p>A sheen of presiperation had smoothed Willow's bangs to her
forehead and she still hadn't opened her eyes since Buffy had told her
to close them. Still resting on the blonde's shoulder she was lost in
her own world, oblivious to everything except what was happening.
Buffy released Willow's right breast and moved her hand down over the
pale, smooth skin of the redhead's belly, she slid her own fingers
over Willow's once more, if the witch noticed she gave no sign, almost
instantly Buffy's hand was coated with the redhead's arousal. She
could feel Willow's fingers gently massaging her clitoris, trying so
hard for that one final push, the break, that last massive wave that
would send her over the edge.</p>

<p>&quot;Here we go. Hang on tight Will.&quot; Buffy whispered and slowly
moved her index finger up and into Willow, pushing steadily upward,
gently, to stimulate and tease all the right places. Moving in rythm
with Willow's own now even more frantic exhertions she eased herself
within and without of Willow's sex. </p>

<p>&quot;Close...&quot; Willow groaned writhing about frantically. &quot;Close
close close close close...&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy smiled to herself, and sped up her touch, her other hand
gave a Willow's breast a slight pinch and she turned her face,
capturing the redhead's lips with her own for the first time in hours.
An event, in liu of all others, that was long over due. </p>

<p>As there touges dueled Buffy felt Willow tighten around her
and heard the beginings of a high keen from the back of her throat.
Releasing Willow's tit she cupped the base of the wiccan's head and
didn't let her break away from the kiss. </p>

<p>Breaking the kiss herself Buffy whispered a harsh command into
her lover's ear. &quot;Come for me. Go with it, c'mon Will. Come for me!&quot;
Before wrapping her tounge again, around the wiccan's.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmm..MMm....MMmmmm..&quot; Willow moaned into the Slayer's mouth,
again Buffy pulled away. &quot;Nnnnnn......Ah!&quot; </p>

<p>Willow went ridged. She opened her eyes, but still didn't see
anything.</p>

<p>Willow felt Buffy inside her, felt her squeeze and spasm
around the Slayer's welcome finger as she finally came. She felt the
Slayer gently pull her own hands away only to get bombarded by fresh
sparks adding fuel to the roaring fire inside when Buffy took over.
The fingers of her left hand stroking her, the index of the right
still buried within.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah...Buffy...&quot; She keened.
&quot;G..ah...Hmmm...hmmm...nn.....aaahh..&quot; She whimpered as the final
crest pushed up, </p>

<p>&quot;...nnnaah...&quot;</p>

<p>over    </p>

<p>&quot;...lo..love you...&quot; </p>

<p>and through. </p>

<p>Sucking in great breaths of air, her oxygen starved frame
trying to restore the status quo. </p>

<p>&quot;You...&quot; Willow gasped. &quot;You are...evil..Buffy...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm happy.&quot; The Slayer giggled, still touching and inside her
love. &quot;I got to watch.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow wiggled her hips proving a point.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, mostly watch.&quot; Buffy amended. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you.&quot; Willow murmered again resting her head on the
Slayer's shoulder. She looks so sleepy, staring at Buffy through half
lidded eyes. 'I love her.' Willow's thoughts echoed her spoken
sentiments. 'And that is just so freaky yet right. Well.. guess that
makes me a freak, yay freakdom!'</p>

<p>&quot;Mutal expressions of feelings Will.&quot; Buffy repled giving the
redhead a peck on the forehead. She stopped her carresses and, looking
Willow right in the eye the entire time, licked her fingers clean.
Willow chuckled quietly and shook her head slightly. &quot;Buzzed here
Buffy, seriously, buzzin' and I don't think I could get shocked by
anything right now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spoilsport.&quot; Buffy playfully grouched. </p>

<p>Willow closed her legs and slid in between the slayers still
open ones so her butt rested on the chair. Buffy wrapped her legs
around Willow's waist while straighting out the sweatshirt she was
wearing.
They didn't say anything. Just...sat in the chair happy with who they
were, where they were, what they had and what they shared. </p>

<p>Yes, these two, these prescious two were perfectly content in
the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>&quot;Ooo! Charlie Brown Christmas Special!&quot; </p>

<p>Had Xander Harris walked through the door that very second he
would have thought he was in Heaven. Two, practically naked, young
attractive women, hand in hand, lovingly dancing around a living room,
moving between furinture, opened presents and wrapping paper. Dancing
together, dancing as lovers, dancing as one.</p>

<p>Dancing the Snoopy dance.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Grand Scheme of Things is rather bizzare.</p>
