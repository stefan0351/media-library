<p>Finally the Bronze was back to normal, or as back to normal as the Bronze
got.  There were no more middle-aged parents running around trying to
recapture their youth with the aid of cursed candy bars.  Buffy had shut
that little operation down.  Thank god.  Things
had gotten just way too creepy.  The fact that Trick had used the operation
as a way to steal newborn babies from the hospital, without the parents
being the wiser was just plain sick, even for vampires.</p>

<p>But that was behind her, the Bronze was back to normal and now she could get
on with the business of having fun...with her favorite redhead...who
appeared to be totally enraptured by the 'Dingoes' playing that very moment
on stage.</p>

<p>Actually, if Buffy didn't know any better, with the way the green eyes were
all fogged over, and the little smile was growing on succulent lips that
tasted like cherry...and Buffy wasn't about to reveal to anyone how she knew
that...it looked like she wanted to devour
the band...or more correctly, one band member in particular.</p>

<p>She looked around to see if anyone else was noticing what she was noticing,
but Xander and Cordelia appeared to be in deep, silent communication of the
international kind...yep, lots of frenching being done there, so they were
no help.  Well...Buffy stopped to consider...with them being distracted like
that...maybe they wouldn't even notice if she went over and sat right next
to Willow.</p>

<p>Plan in mind, she did just that, squeezing into the large, overstuffed,
yellow chair that was Willow's current haven.  &quot;Hey.&quot;  She greeted, her
voice chipper.  &quot;Having fun?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow jumped, guiltily.  She'd known Buffy had said she was going to join
them later, after her patrol, but she hadn't even seen her come in.  She had
been distracted...very distracted, Xander's close prescence, who was
currently enjoying the favor's of his current
girlfriend, who she guilitily acknowledged she was jealous of, not to
mention being ashamed of the looks and glances and touches that the
life-long friends had been stealing frorm each other, with none of their
significant others being the wiser, not to mention the
extremely pleasant...things she was doing with Buffy, while her current
boyfriend Oz was none the wiser, were all adding up to make a very confused
brain.  To distract herself, she had been attempting to focus all of her
energies on Oz, who was at the moment thrilling
her with his performance on stage, but she couldn't help remembering that
long limo ride after homecoming, the way Buffy had made love to her, so
tenderly, touching her in ways she hadn't even known existed.</p>

<p>This was all wrong, wrong, just wrong.  What was the matter with her?  Was
she a nymphomaniac or something?  She'd heard the term, of course, but she'd
never assumed she'd be like that.  For the first time in her life she had a
strong, loving boyfriend.  Who was in a band.  When he looked at her with
his honest brown eyes, she simply melted
inside.  She should be happy, she was in a nice, normal relationship.
People wouldn't look at her funny, or whisper strange things about her
behind her back.</p>

<p>But then there was Buffy, her best friend, her first lover...and there was a
word she'd never thought would apply to her.  The school geek becoming the
lover of the most beautiful, strong, confidant person in the
world...impossible...or so she had thought...until that night
of the slumber party...when everything had changed...except nobody was the
wiser...except for the two of them.  And that left everything strange and
new, uncertain and confusing, Heckle and Jeckle...no, now she was confusing
her adjectives.</p>

<p>She'd been drowning in the confusion, until the day before homecoming...and
her bedroom...and the kiss.  She hadn't meant to...actually she could swear
that Xander had started it...and they'd both called it a fluke...except that
it wasn't...and it kept
happening...and she wasn't sure what to do about it.  She and Xander had
been friends forever, and she had always had a crush on him, even after he
had broke her Barbie...but now...it was like now she had all these doors
open before her...all of these choices, where before she had none.   She
didn't know how to choose, and so she kept grabbing at all of these
opportunities like some greedy little octopus.</p>

<p>She knew that she would have to make some decisions, fairly quickly, or this
would all blow up in her face...and everyone that she cared about stood a
great chance of getting hurt.  She wondered how her life had suddenly got so
complicated, then she realized one of the reasons was currently waving her
hand in front of her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Earth to Willow...come in Wills.&quot;  Buffy said, watching the green eyes for
any sign of awareness.  When they settled into focus, Buffy continued.  &quot;The
band's really good tonight, huh?&quot;  She said, twitching when she heard the
note of jealousy in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;  Willow asked, intelligently, still momentarily distracted, this time
by Xander and Cordy's exit, heading to the dance floor, she predicted,
feeling satisfied when she was right.  &quot;What?&quot;  She asked, meeting Buffy's
blue ones again, noticing the flash of concern
that was immediately washed away with...nonchalence...humor?  She couldn't
be sure.  &quot;Oh yeah...they're good?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment, then made up her mind.  &quot;Okay Wills, you
seem...no you are very distracted.  Spill!&quot;  Buffy commanded, not knowing if
it was the right thing to do, but not being able to take the air of
confusion around her.</p>

<p>Willow opened her mouth like she was about to say something, but quickly
snapped it shut and shook her head.  &quot;It's nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>'Don't want to talk about it, huh?'  Buffy thought, although it wouldn't
take a genius to figure out what was bothering her adorable redhead.  'Her?'
  Was she getting all possesive now?  She'd better watch that, considering
Willow wasn't really 'hers' to begin with.  She
was still dating Oz, and as much as Buffy hated that she didn't dare admit
it.  Perhaps that was why she hadn't told anyone of Angel's return...she
knew it was wrong, she knew of the pain he had caused, and yet...she
couldn't seem to deny him.  Even now.</p>

<p>'Well, I'll bet he hasn't done half the stuff I have.&quot;  Buffy thought
vindictively, her mind back on Oz now.  She let an evil smile slip over her
lips as she stared at the guitar player on the stage.  'Willow hasn't let
you, huh?  Saving all her loving for a Slayer.'  She couldn't
bring herself to feel bad about that.  'So Willow's distracted...'  Glancing
over at her lover she noticed that her eyes had returned to the stage.
'Hmm...'  An idea was brewing in the back of her mind...an idea so
daring...not to mention risky...that she didn't know if she
would be able to pull it off.  But then again...she was the Slayer, she was
used to battling the odds.  A slow smile weaved across her face as the idea
planted itself firmly in her mind.  'Let's see if we can help with that
distraction, hmmm?'  Mental hands rubbed together gleefully, while one that
was real slid gently, almost unobtrusively under the cloth of a skirt, and
over a silk covered thigh.</p>

<p>Willow gasped softly as she felt a gentle squeeze on her thigh.  Looking
down she could see Buffy's wrist, the rest of her hand being covered by the
skirt.  &quot;Buffy!&quot;  She hissed, being careful not to project her voice to the
people around them, half hidden in the
shadows of the Bronze.  &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;</p>

<p>She heard a low, seductive chuckle and gulped against the rising tide.  She
knew what the chuckle meant, she also knew when Buffy set her mind on
something she was hardly ever detered.  &quot;I'm helping you with your
distraction...by distracting you.&quot;  Buffy chuckled, wryly.</p>

<p>Willow whimpered as she felt the hand move, tracing a light teasing line
into her skin. &quot;Buffy...we can't...we can't do this here...people will see.&quot;
  Willow protested vehemently, although Buffy could tell from the light
pants she was emitting, that her lover was already excited about the idea.</p>

<p>&quot;Who's going to see, Will, hmm?&quot; Buffy asked, breathing hotly into Willow's
ear, tracing the edge of it with her tongue.  &quot;Oz?&quot;  Buffy shook her head
gently, and Willow could feel the softness of Buffy's hair slide gently
across her cheek.  &quot;He's way over there, on
stage...he wouldn't see.&quot;  Willow acknowledged that much was true as she
felt an unseen hand trail a tickling line down the back of her neck.  Buffy
knew how much that drove her crazy.  'She's getting a kick out of this.'
She thought accusingly, even as Buffy's soft murmuring's continued.  &quot;Xander
and Cordy...they're too busy with each other to see
anybody else...much less care what they were doing...&quot;  Willow looked around
wildly for her friends, but she could see what the Slayer meant.  Xander and
Cordy were wrapped around each other, so close they could be Siamese,
looking oblivious to the whole world.</p>

<p>&quot;As far as anybody else...&quot;  Buffy said, nibbling on the nearby ear, sending
sparks of pleasure racing through the redheads blood stream.  &quot;They wouldn't
care if we were over here humping each others brains out.&quot;  She said
coarsely, feeling the way Willow shivered
at the remark.</p>

<p>Willow whimpered at the imagery, and the feel of a warm hand sliding down
her back. &quot;They wouldn't care, Will, cause they're all doing it
themselves...just standing up.&quot;  Buffy continued, delighted with Willow's
reactions so far.  She was winning...she was going to
have her lover right here, and she'd be damned if she'd let anyone stop her.
  &quot;Look at them, Will...all gyrating seductively on the dance
floor...pressing against each other...feeling how aroused they make each
other...it's sex...standing up.&quot;  She had moved from Willow's
ear and now was proceeding in mapping Willow's skin, every solid inch of it,
with her tongue.  She liked the side of her neck the best, she decided.
Right where a Vampire would bite.  She tested the theory gently, grazing the
skin with her teeth.  The move earned a squirm and a very soft moan.</p>

<p>&quot;You know...I kind of feel sorry for them.&quot;  Buffy said, watching the
writhing couples while she made her own lover writhe at her attentions.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;  Willow squeeked, understandably so since Buffy had just tweaked her
nipple.  'God that feels good...I've gotta stop her.' She thought to
herself, but she was unable to muster up the resolve to tell her.</p>

<p>&quot;Because...they all want to do what we're doing right now.  But they don't
have this comfy chair...or this dark corner.&quot;  Buffy replied, and as she
did, she moved the hand that was under Willow's skirt further up her legs
until her fingers were just brushing the bottom of Willow's underwear, then
she felt Willow freeze and she stopped, gauging her lover's reaction.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy...&quot;  Willow finally found reason to protest as she put her hand on
top of her lover's, holding her progress.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow...I want to do this...I really...want to do this.&quot;  Buffy said,
feeling the warm heat burning inside her as she moved her other hand in
gentle, soothing circles on her lover's stomach.  &quot;But I won't if you tell
me not to.&quot;  Buffy hated giving up that power, sure that she was about to be
disappointed and Willow would take off like a shot, but just as she was sure
she was going to bolt, she felt her relax perceptibly in her arms.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want you to stop.&quot;  Willow admitted, both to herself and to Buffy.
What she was doing just felt to good to resist.  It was all Buffy could do
to keep a big, satisfied smile off of her face.  She knew if Willow managed
to look over and see it the deal would be off.</p>

<p>&quot;Lean back against me.&quot;  Buffy suggested, repositioning herself in the
chair.  Willow shifted position, one leg thrown over Buffy's as her head
came to rest near the blonde's, both heads sharing the back of the chair.</p>

<p>'Perfect.'  Buffy sighed, in utter contentment, having almost attained her
goal.  Just a few more inches and she would attain perfection, nirvana,
bliss.  Willow hissed as her fingers came into contact with her goal.  She
could feel the warm heat emanating from Willow's
soft center, the lips already spread thanks in part to the spread legs of
her lover, welcomed her in.  She could feel the dampness of Willow's
underwear and knew that if they weren't barring her way she would be able to
feel the redhead's slickness.  She damned the panties
and tights in her way, and was tempted to shred them, but she knew Willow
wouldn't like that.  &quot;Can you do me a favor?&quot;  She whispered instead,
gaining the redhead's attention.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;  Willow muttered, too caught up in what Buffy's fingers were doing to
pay really close attention.</p>

<p>&quot;I need you to take off your tights.&quot;  Buffy whispered, nibbling on the
conviently close ear once more.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Willow almost bolted at that, but a quickly moving finger, stroking
over her clit just right stopped her in her tracks.  &quot;Why?&quot;  She managed to
say, through clenched teeth, fighting back the incredibly powerful moan that
seemed determined to leave her mouth, no
doubt to echo throughout the room, drowning out any noise from the band and
draw unwanted attention their way.  &quot;Can't you just...&quot;  She left the words
unsaid, sure that Buffy would know what she meant.</p>

<p>&quot;Well...yeah...but it wouldn't be nearly as pleasurable.  For you...or me.&quot;
Buffy admitted, craving the feel of Willow's wetness even as she rubbed
against the damp crotch.  &quot;I'll even help if you want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;P-panties too?&quot;  Willow asked, with a gulp, she couldn't believe she was
doing this in such a public place.</p>

<p>&quot;Just half way...just in case.&quot;  She left it unspoken that Willow would have
to hurry to pull them up if Cordy or Xander managed to find their way back
there before they were done. &quot;I'll handle the rest.&quot;  Buffy said
confidantly, not wanting Willow to lose the mood.</p>

<p>&quot;O-okay.&quot;  Willow said, then moved so fast the movement was barely
perceptible.  She was back in Buffy's arms before the blond could blink, her
underwear halfway down her thighs, but still covered by her skirt.</p>

<p>Buffy chuckled at the quick movement.  &quot;That was fast...somebody's
impatient.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't want them to see me.&quot;  Willow explained, feeling her face flush.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry...I barely saw you and I was sitting right here.&quot;  Buffy
chuckled, content and eager to resume where she'd left off.  &quot;Now...where
were we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you were...&quot;  Willow squeeked again, unable to hide the intense
pleasure from showing on her face.  It's a good thing it was dark in that
corner.  &quot;Right there.&quot;  She finished, her voice still in the squeeky stage.</p>

<p>'Oh god.' Buffy thought as her fingers slid home.  &quot;You feel so good.&quot;  she
said hoarsely, hearing Willow's agreeing moan in her ears.  It wasn't like
they hadn't done this before...they had...but each time it felt
like...coming home.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before Willow was panting, her head  pressed deeply back
againt the cushions of the chair, her fingers clutching at Buffy's arm as
the teasing fingers played havoc with her senses.  She didn't even care she
was in a public place anymore.  The whole room could be looking at her and
she wouldn't have cared at this point.  All that
mattered at the moment was Buffy's fingers, whom she hoped would never stop
moving, and this glorious rising feeling inside her that made her want to
scream with joy.</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't take her eyes off of Willow's face.  She looked so beautiful
in this moment, her head arched back, her eyes shut tight, pleasure shining
from her like a beacon.  It was selfish of her to hope she was the only one
who'd ever get to see it, and yet she couldn't
help the feeling rising in her chest.  She was breathtaking.  &quot;Willow.&quot;  She
whispered, and was struck speechless by the dazzling green eyes that opened
momentarily to meet hers.  It
was on the tip of her tongue...she was going to say it this time...she
really was.  &quot;I...&quot;  But then she felt it, the slight tremors that indicated
Willow's closeness and the green eyes shut again, the graceful neck arcing
even more if that were possible and Buffy was lost in the moment.  Willow
grasped her tightly, burying her face into the Slayer's shoulder as she
whimpered, and Buffy felt the tightness of her muscles grasping at her
fingers as she came.</p>

<p>For long moments Willow just rested against her, panting heavily, trying to
catch her breath.  Then she picked up her head, gazing at her with amazed
green eyes.  &quot;That...that was...I can't believe we just did that.&quot;  Willow
said, looking around the Bronze nervously, but nothing seemed out of place,
nothing seemed unusal.  Buffy had been right all along, it was as if, to the
other patrons, like they'd never done that at all.  They were safe in their
private little corner.  Their own little peice of heaven.  She felt stress
free for the first time
in days.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;  She whispered, sincerely, meeting the Slayer's eyes
with her own.</p>

<p>Buffy grinned, and kissed her forehead gently.  &quot;Anytime.&quot;  Yeah, Willow,
I'll fly with you to Heaven anytime.</p>
