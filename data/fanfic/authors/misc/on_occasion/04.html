<p align=center><i>It's been One Week since you looked at me,<br>
Turned your head to the side and said, "I'm angry."<br>
Five days since you laughed at me,<br>
Said, "Get back together, come back and see me."<br>
Three days since the living room,<br>
You realized it's not my fault but only too soon.<br>
Yesterday you just looked at me,<br>
You said, "It'll still be two days &#8216;til I say I'm sorry."<br>
&#8212;Barenaked Ladies "One Week"</i></p>

<P>She's on her regular Wetherly Park patrol it happens. Three of
them gang up on her. Their faces are dark, contoured into hideous grins, eyes
yellow, claws and fangs bared. Each of them has the strength of ten men, and no
soul. They gang up on the small blonde girl. One small unassuming
blonde.</P>
<P>They don't stand a chance.</P>
<P>She launches herself into a flurry of kicks, punches and jabs.
The first one who dares to lay hands on her takes a stake to the chest,
exploding in a cloud of ash instantly.</P>
<P>And I'm hiding behind a tree nearby, with the best view of the
show.</P>
<P>Goddess, she's so beautiful in action. Or still. Or smiling at
me. Or naked, her body responding in convulsions when I sent her over the
edge&#8212;</P>
<P>Geez, Willow, one-track-mind much?</P>
<P>When did it happen? When did our lives get so complicated? When
did I get positively addicted to her laugh, to her touch, to her
kisses?</P>
<P>Why did she stop talking to me?</P>
<P>I knew the answer to that last one; it's been a week since that
situation with Spike. One week since Oz and Cordy caught me and Xander kissing.
One week since Buffy heard about the kiss, and she hadn't spoken to me
since.</P>
<P>I have to face her. I have to make this right.</P>
<P>I have to get my Buffy back.</P>
<P>How's this for crazy; I'm more worried about losing Buffy than I
was at the prospect of losing my boyfriend. Okay, I guess <I>ex</I>-boyfriend's
more accurate at this point. I didn't go after him after Xander, and judging
from his reaction, I'd pretty much say it was over.</P>
<P>I kinda regret that, but I'd hate myself more if my kiss cost me
Buffy.</P>
<P>I go back to watching Buffy finish the remaining two vampires.
Buffy-watching. This could be the next great national pastime. Maybe replace
baseball. At least for me.</P>
<P>She kicks the second vamp hard in the solar plexus (at least I
think it was the solar plexus. I was never quite sure where the solar plexus
was, but the way he doubled over in pain, it sure looked like a solar plexus
hit), when the third one jumps her from behind.</P>
<P>She's too busy concentrating on the vamp, she doesn't even see
his partner. The third vamp grabs her by the shoulders, restraining her so she
can't get any leverage. She thrashes around, keeping him from biting her, but I
see her sweating. She's tiring, and the vamp isn't letting her go.</P>
<P>I'm afraid. She's in trouble, and I don't want to lose her. Not
after&#8230;</P>
<P>Say it, Wills, not after I fell in love with her.</P>
<P>Hell, not after she and I became lovers.</P>
<P>Yep, that's right, lovers. As in naked, sleeping together
(although sleeping wasn't our primary activity. Ooh, bad Willow, bad evil
Willow!). And now, she's being beaten by a vampire. I have to stop the vamp, but
how? All I can do right now is float a pencil!</P>
<P>Float a pencil.</P>
<P>I pull a pencil out of my purse, place it on the ground in front
of me and concentrate. The pencil rises slowly, until it's at about chest level.
Okay, students, let's try something new and exciting. I channel all my energy
and concentration into the pencil, and into the chest of the vampire that was
trying to kill my Buffy.</P>
<P>The pencil flies like a bullet, straight into the vamp's
chest.</P>
<P>Buffy collapses to the ground and I rushed to her side. "Buffy!
Are you okay?" </P>
<P>Buffy scrambles to her feet, trying to shake off my hands as I
try to steady her. "I'm fine, Wills, just dandy." She looks around, at the
remains of the three vamps. "What happened to that last one?"<BR></P>
<P>"I happened to him." She looks at me like I'm suddenly turning
violet.</P>
<P>"How'd you do that? I mean, thanks, but how?"<BR></P>
<P>"I floated a pencil at him." She looks at me skeptically. I
amend that last statement; "At high speed." She blinks. Good, I have her
attention. "Hey, it's pointy, it's made of wood, it fulfills the requirements
for being a stake, it worked!"</P>
<P>Buffy shakes her head, and makes it to her feet, facing me. "I
guess that one's a keeper. Thanks Wills." She brushes the vamp dust from her
pants, totally unaware of the effect this has on me. "I'd better be getting
home. Mom'll be worried if I don't report in, y'know." She turns away from me,
and starts for her home.</P>
<P>But I won't let her go that easily. "Buffy!"</P>
<P>I'm surprised by the volume of my voice, and judging from the
startled look on her face, so's Buffy. "Buffy," I lower my voice, but my resolve
face is still in full force. "You can't just walk away from me. We need to talk
about this&#8212; this thing between us."</P>
<P>"Thing?" Buffy asked me innocently enough. "I wasn't aware of
any &#8216;thing' between us. I thought we were totally thing-free here."</P>
<P>Was Buffy trying to hurt me with that statement, or did she just
not get what I was talking about? I'm going with the latter; less painful that
way. "I'm talking about us, Buffy. You haven't spoken to me for the last week,
ever since that run-in with Spike."</P>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy gives me this sour look. She's gonna be a hard
sell. "Ever since you and Xander swapped spit!"</P>
<P>"Buffy, it wasn't like that!"</P>
<P>"Oh? Your lips were on his, how should I translate
that?"</P>
<P>"What about you and Angel?"</P>
<P>She opens her mouth, and shuts it again. Oh yeah, I have her. I
move in for the kill. "You could have trusted me, you could have told me that he
was back. But you decided to keep him your little secret."</P>
<P>Buffy rolls her eyes and sighs deeply. "I know. And I'm sorry
about that. But nothing happened between me and Angel. And nothing's ever gonna
happen. First, it's too dangerous for us, you know that, curse and all. Second&#8230;
God, I don't even know why I'm doing this! You don't even want to be here, do
you? Isn't Xander waiting for you?"</P>
<P>I flinch briefly then I regain my composure, not wanting her to
see how much that last crack hurt. It doesn't work. Lucky me. When she sees me
flinching her eyes become less angry, her expression less severe. "Oh Willow,
I'm sorry, that was low. I didn't mean it that way&#8230;"</P>
<P>"Shh," I offer my hand to her, and slowly, she accepts. "It's
okay. That is the real thing that's hanging between us, and you deserve to know
the truth." I see her hesitate slightly, but I hold her hand tighter. "Please,
Buffy. I want to tell you."</P>
<P>Buffy looks at me with those warm hazel-blue eyes of hers. Gods
she is so beautiful!</P>
<P>"Okay, Wills," she answers calmly. "I'm listening."</P>
<P>"Buffy," I start slowly. I don't want to risk saying the wrong
words. "I guess the main thing was that I was scared. Not of Spike, well not any
more than I'm usually scared of him, but of me. I mean suddenly I'm making out
with my best friend, my best female friend, and I wasn't sure how much of a
freak that made me."</P>
<P>"Willow, you're not&#8230;"</P>
<P>"Buffy, please let me finish. I was afraid. I said that, right?
Well I was. Afraid of doing something that would make you not like me, afraid of
going too far, or not far enough, afraid of what my parents would think, what
Xander and the others would think, what Oz would think&#8230;I was afraid. And
confused, don't forget that one, that's a biggie. I mean, was I gay, or just not
too picky?</P>
<P>"When Xander and I were alone in the warehouse&#8230;and earlier in
the library, I guess&#8230;" Buffy glares briefly when I mention that moment, but she
keeps quiet. Thank Goddess! "&#8230;I was trying to deal with those issues. I needed
to know how much I had changed. I needed to know&#8230;I needed to know if I still
liked boys. Y'know? And besides, Spike scared us both, a whole lot. So those two
times, and he leaned in to kiss me&#8230;well, I let him."</P>
<P>I watch Buffy's face intently, searching for any clues that she
would blow up at me. She stays level, calm, and perhaps a little sympathetic. "I
had to, Buffy. I had to know if my old childhood crush was still there. I had to
know how much our time together recently had changed me."</P>
<P>Buffy lowers her eyes, making her expression difficult to read.
"So what's the verdict, Wills? Did he do anything for you?"</P>
<P>I took her chin in my hand and raise her face to mine. I have to
see those lovely eyes when I tell her. "Nothing, Buffy. Nothing at all." I smile
when I see her let go of her breath, when I hear her relieved sigh. "And it's
not just that I got over him, Buffy. It's because I know now the truth." I took
her face in my hands. "I love you. Buffy Summers, I'm in love with you. There's
no other way to say it. If that makes me gay, then I guess that means I'm
gay."</P>
<P>It's ten seconds later and I hear no response from Buffy. Maybe
it's time for me to worry&#8230;</P>
<P>"Look Buffy, you don't have to return my love, that's not a
problem. I just don't want to lose you as a best friend, because that would be
bad an-MMPH!"</P>
<P>I would continue on in babble mode, but it's kinda difficult to
talk when Buffy's luscious lips are affixed to mine. Of course, at this point,
who cares?</P>
<P>She slowly moves back and looks at me. Her eyes, which were
accusing not five minutes ago, are now wide with wonder. Her mouth, clenched
with anger before, is now wide and smiling. "I told you the first reason why
it's over between me and Angel, because of his curse." She leans in, and I feel
her breath on my face. Ooh, I am getting so turned on now! "I didn't tell you
the second reason."</P>
<P>"And what's that?"</P>
<P>Her smile becomes a little more wicked. Oh yeah, this is gonna
be fun. "Because there's someone else now."</P>
<P>"Anyone I know?" I tease her. I know, shameless, but I can't
resist.</P>
<P>"Well," she teases back, "she's a bit of a computer nut, she has
a ten-thousand watt smile and short red hair, and she's standing about two
inches away from me."</P>
<P>"Hmm, that narrows the field a bit."</P>
<P>"That was your cue to shut up and pucker up, Willow," she growls
wolfishly. I stop talking and allow her lips to claim me. She's claiming me,
taking me, making me her own. I let her willingly. I want, more than I've ever
wanted anything in my life, to be hers.</P>
<P>Her lips are soft on mine, her hands tight around my waist. Her
mouth slowly opens, her tongue touching the seam between my lips&#8212;Knock, knock,
Willow, can I come in?</P>
<P>Of course you can! I open my mouth and now our tongues are
moving, dancing against each other, slowly, oh so slowly&#8230;</P>
<P>"Buffy," I reluctantly break off the kiss (somehow I doubt that
my suffocating in mid-kiss would be all that romantic a gesture, maybe I'm being
picky, I dunno&#8230;). "If this is gonna lead to where I hope it leads, maybe we
should head back to my place."</P>
<P>Buffy looks around, and I'm getting the same sense of urgency
from her that I feel at this time. I want her, and I sense that she wants me.
Knowing that is making me hotter than a&#8230;well, a really hot thing.</P>
<P>Okay, so I'm a wiccan, not a poet!</P>
<P>"Let's see," she muses, her lips straying on mine as she talks.
"Your house is&#8230;six blocks from here&#8230; too far&#8230;ooh&#8230;away&#8230;and mine is three&#8230;blocks
in the other&#8230;mmmhh&#8230;direction&#8230;and Mom's home&#8230;"</P>
<P>"Mmhh&#8230;" I feel her hands slowly roaming my body. Each touch
sends a thousand pinpricks through my skin. But here, in the park&#8230; "Buffy, we're
a little&#8230; uhh&#8230; exposed here."</P>
<p>"Not yet," she grins evilly. "But what a wonderful idea!"
She starts to unbutton my shirt.</P>
<P>"Buffy!" I swat her hands away, but she keeps at it. "Not
here!"</P>
<P>"I want you, Willow," she whispers, her voice husky with desire.
"I want you now."</P>
<P>"I want you too, Buffy, but not here!" Man do I want her! My
body is hot, my nerves are hypersensitive, and my&#8230;uh&#8230;Damn, Willow, say it, my
vagina, yeah, that's it, my vagina's getting wetter by the second. "But out
here's not good, honey. We could be seen."</P>
<P>"There's the old gazebo," she purrs in my ear. "There's no light
there, no one will see us. And besides, no one comes out here at this time of
night."</P>
<P>"Yeah, no one but the local night life," I add. "Or should I
say, un-life?" She looks at me, puzzled a little, until my meaning becomes
clear. Then the light goes on in her eyes.</P>
<P>"You're right," Buffy admits, her shoulders slumping. "But I
want you so much, Wills."</P>
<P>"Yeah, me too." I look around, afraid that Spike or one of his
cronies might still be around.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Buffy pulls away from me. "I got an idea, Wills," She
takes my hand and guides me quickly to the park gazebo. An old weathered wooden
structure, the gazebo was still used occasionally by small concert bands and
jazz groups during the summer. But at night, it's a dark, shadowy thing,
rickety, unlit, foreboding. Give it a few more walls, and it would pass for a
haunted house.</P>
<P>She fishes through her purse, and pulls out a small glass
bottle. "Holy water," she explains. She removes the stopper, and lets the holy
water dribble out of the bottle in a small stream. She walks around the gazebo,
using the holy water to outline it, and I smile when I realize what she's doing.
Any vamp trying to get to the gazebo before the water evaporates, it'll be like
touching a live wire. </P>
<P>That's why she's the Slayer.</P>
<P>When she's finished vamp-proofing our little love-nest, Buffy
leads me up the stairs, and toward the center of the platform. She steps back
and looks at me. "God, Willow, you just keep getting more beautiful every time I
see you."</P>
<P>"Thanks," I smile. It's still hard for me to get used to hearing
her say that. "I guess there's nowhere to go but up."</P>
<P>"Don't ever say that," she whispers emphatically. "You have
never been anything less than truly beautiful. Here," she kisses my cheek,
"here," she kisses my lips. "And here," she touches my breasts, which tingle at
her contact. Her hands start unbuttoning my top again, and this time I don't
stop her. The cool night air hits my body as my top opens, and my skin vibrates
as Buffy touches it. I shimmy the top off, breaking the ethereal spell, and
suddenly Buffy and I are removing our clothes as quickly as possible, discarding
tops, shoes, jeans, bras and panties onto a haphazard pile.</P>
<P>"Make love to me," I plead quietly, gazing at the naked beauty
before me. </P>
<P>"With pleasure," she grins, pure lust on her face. She takes me
in her arms, and starts nibbling at my ear. "I am going to eat you up, my little
pretty." Her fingertips brush against my nipples, causing them to harden. "I am
going to memorize every square inch of your gorgeous body." She caresses my
right breast, while kissing my throat. My knees buckle, and I have to lower
myself to the floor. Buffy doesn't let up, and soon I am lying down with Buffy
over me. Her lips are hot and insistent on mine, and her hands seem to be
everywhere on my body at once.</P>
<P>"You like that," she purrs. "You like it when I kiss you like
this," she demonstrates, her mouth fusing itself to my left nipple.</P>
<P>I like that? That's the understatement of the year! Goddess she
does that so well.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah," I moan, arching my back as Buffy suckles my breast
into her mouth. "Whatever you're doing, don't stop!"</P>
<P>Buffy lifts her head and winks at me. "Don't worry, babe, I
don't plan to." She returns her attention to my breast, laving it with her
tongue, then nipping it with her teeth. I'm lost from that point on. Oh yeah,
Buffy, do what you want to me&#8230;</P>
<P>Oh, no, don't leave my boob now, &#8212;Oh! You're starting on my
other boob. Okay, I can deal&#8230;oooh, yeah&#8230;with that. Oh dear, where ya going with
that hand? Somewhere below the waist, right, oh yes, right there. You want my
legs a little more apart? I&#8230;ummmh!&#8230;can do that, sure. Now what are
you&#8212;?</P>
<P>"Sit up, Willow, I wanna try something." I hear her instructing
me, and I obey without thinking twice. Or even once. Thinking isn't exactly on
my list of things to do right now. She positions my body so that my left leg is
over her right, and her right leg is over my left. What is she&#8212;?</P>
<P>She scoochies up to me, positioning her groin against mine.
Suddenly it makes sense. Oh boy does it ever make sense! Her core is up against
mine, warm and wet. She starts to rub her body against mine, and every inch of
me is on fire. Ooh, bad Buffy, bad&#8230;no, good, good Buffy, incredible, fantastic,
amazing Buffy! I start rubbing, trying to time my going up to her going down,
and now we have our legs in this scissors formation, rubbing our sexes against
each other. Oh my Goddess! Willow Rosenberg, your trip to heaven is now picking
up speed.</P>
<P>But she's still not done. Her hand finds its way to our
juncture, and suddenly her hand's inside of me. Oh yeah! Well&#8230;Buffy, two&#8230;can
(UNGH!) play&#8230;that game! I start to stroke her vaginal hood, inserting my thumb
against that little nubbin. She gasps. Oh yeah, I made Buffy gasp. Go Willow, go
Willow&#8230;</P>
<P>My heart is hammering, my breathing is ragged, and it won't be
long now. I try to pace myself, listening to Buffy's moans and gasps. I'm about
to climax, but I'm taking her with me. My vision starts to blur&#8230;oh yeah, this is
it! I quicken my pace, rubbing my hand against her faster, and she jolts, her
body arching suddenly, her head thrown back. Oh yeah, this is the big
one!</P>
<P>We move as one&#8230;we moan as one&#8230;</P>
<P>We come as one&#8230;</P>
<P>We collapse as one&#8230;</P>
<P>I don't know how long we lie together, our limbs entangled, our
heads against each other, and I don't care. Buffy lifts her hand to my mouth,
and I start suckling it, while offering my hand to Buffy for the same purpose.
We taste us, the mixture of the both of us on each other's hands. Man that is so
sexy.</P>
<P>Nothing short of the Master's return would spoil this moment,
with the two of us just relaxing, reveling in our closeness, our calmed passion,
our love. Love. Oh what a wonderful word. Love. Used in a sentence, I love Buffy
with all my heart and soul.</P>
<P>And the sex is pretty incredible too.</P>
<P>"Willow," she murmurs against my shoulder. "We're gonna have to
get dressed soon."</P>
<P>"Aww," I groan. "Can't we just stay like this
forever?"</P>
<P>"Afraid not, Wills," she insists as she pries herself away from
me. I don't want her to go, so I move back toward her. "Hey, c'mon, find your
togs, we gotta get out of here before the holy water evaporates. Let's go, chop
chop."</P>
<P>"Oh, all right," I grumble as we locate our clothes. They got a
little scattered over the gazebo, but after a mad scramble we manage to get our
things on and look at least slightly presentable. I think I'm wearing Buffy's
bra, but then remember she didn't have one on in the first place.</P>
<P>"So," Buffy asks me suddenly, "that thing about you loving me,
is that still on?"</P>
<P>I grin hugely. "Oh yeah. On and on and on."</P>
<P>"Good," she leans in and kisses my nose. "Because I love you
too." </P>
<P>Well, after a performance like that, I kinda had my suspicions,
but just hearing the words warms me to my core. </P>
<P>"Uh, Willow," she looks at me again, and I can see the hunger
stirring in her eyes. "Are your folks at home tonight?"</P>
<P>"Uh, no," I smile. "Business trip."</P>
<P>"Well," she slinks slowly toward me, her arms are around my
waist again. "I can't let you go home alone to a big empty house, can I?"
Without warning, she lets go of me, and winces a bit in slight pain.</P>
<P>"Buffy, are you okay?"</P>
<P>"I'll say this much," she straightens out her back. "The next
time we do this&#8230;which I'm hoping will be fifteen or twenty minutes from now&#8230;a
mattress had better be involved. Or at least sofa cushions." She kisses me
again, her lips lingering against mine once more.</P>
<P>"Uh," I start to stammer. She's not the only one who's desire
hasn't been fully sated. "You think you can control yourself long enough for us
to get there?"</P>
<P>"Hmm&#8212;" she slips her tongue into my mouth for a second. "Maybe.
If we hurry."</P>
<P>"Race ya there," I'm off like a shot, with Buffy hot on my
heels.</P>
<P>Oh yeah, I hate fighting with Buffy. But I love making up with
her. </P>
<P>Or is that just making her?</P>

<hr>

<P>He wiped the ashen remains of the newbie vamp who was stalking
the Slayer and her love off of his duster, and looked at the gazebo as the two
girls ran off, presumably to continue their activities.</P>
<P>He smiled ruefully; not too long ago, he was the one who shared
passion with the Slayer. Just the one time. The one terrible, wonderful time
that cost him his soul and her the lives of good friends. One moment of madness,
for which Jenny and Kendra paid the forfeit.</P>
<P>Angel turned away from the gazebo. He was no voyeur; he didn't
seek out to stalk Buffy and Willow, to witness their lovemaking. But her scent
was pungent in the air that night, and its siren song still had power over
him.</P>
<P>When he saw her with Willow, he ducked away. Very clever, Buffy,
marking your territory with holy water. He was able to ignore their passion for
the duration, save for a few screams toward the end. He feared that the entire
vampire population of Sunnydale might have heard them.</P>
<P>Fortunately, only a few vamps, all newbies, were within earshot.
Easy enough for Angel to deal with while Buffy was&#8230;otherwise occupied. <I>Humph,
nice diplomatic turn of phrase there, Angel.</P></I>
<P>As the two newfound lovers left for a more sheltered rendezvous
point, he smiled. He had always seen something in Buffy's eyes when she was with
Willow. And now she knew what Angel had always suspected, that the shy young
witch was a better match for Buffy than he had ever been.</P><I>
<P>Be happy, Buffy. And know that I'll always be there to defend
you. Both of you.</P></I>
<P>He left for his mansion, and for the first time in over a
century, enjoyed a peaceful rest.</P>
