<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 15 -->

<p>The next few weeks went by at a snails pace for the entire Scooby gang.
Faith was still upset that she never got her chance to beat Oz up for what
he did to Willow, but every time she tried Buffy would distract her with
promises of other, much more enjoyable things. Buffy had been spending most
of her time comforting Willow, especially since Oz decided to leave after
what happened. That left Faith to hang out with Missy more, even though it
seemed like Missy was trying to detach herself from the group of friends.</p>

<p>"Why so glum chum?" Faith asked as she walked into the dorm room, which she
now practically lived in. She noticed that Missy was lying on her bed
surrounded by thick textbooks and rolled her eyes. "You've really got to get
over this," she said with an emphatic sigh.</p>

<p>Missy didn't even look up from her books, and continued working as she
replied to Faith. "My parents don't pay for me to come here and fail Faith,"
she said flatly, not caring anymore that her and Faith had similar
conversations everyday lately.</p>

<p>Faith collapsed onto her and Buffy's small bed and stared up at the ceiling
as she spoke. "You know what I mean. All you do is eat, sleep and school
work these days. Hell you hardly eat. Don't make me have to beat some sense
into you."</p>

<p>"Blame Cordy," Missy replied as she set her book down. She knew she hadn't
really been depressed over Cordy, but it was the easiest excuse she could
come up with for being so glum lately. "And like you could," she smiled as
she stared Faith down.</p>

<p>Faith laughed, glad to see the familiar spark back in Missy's eyes. She
smiled in spite of herself, amazed that she was actually being helpful to
someone. It was new to her, not only having friends but wanting to do things
to make them happy, to be there for them. "You know I could. Don't make me
have to prove my point," Faith said with a wicked grin.</p>

<p>Missy walked over to Faith and Buffy's bed and smirked at Faith. "Don't make
me have to prove mine," she said as a challenge, feeling good for the first
time since she had gotten Cordelia's call about her and Angel getting
together. Faith, never being one to back down from anything rose from the
bed and looked Missy in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Just remember, you asked for this," she teased. The two stared at each
other for several seconds, and if any stranger were to see them they'd think
that the two girls were about ready to rip each other's heads off. Suddenly
Faith broke into a wide grin, and tugged on Missy, so she had the girl
trapped in her arms and started tickling her unmercifully. Missy collapsed
to the floor, bringing Faith down with her, as she struggled to breathe
while laughing so hard.</p>

<p>Just as Faith was about to let up, she heard the door opening and smiled as
she saw Buffy walk in. "Hey B, come give me a hand," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes narrowed as she wondered what the two had been doing though she
smiled at the two of them. "You know it's a good thing that I trust the two
of you or I might be wondering what's going on here," she said playfully.</p>

<p>Faith stood up, and offered her hand to Missy to help the other girl up as
well. "I was just cheering her up. 'Bout time don't you think?" Faith asked,
and Buffy didn't fail to notice the proud look in her girlfriend's eyes. She
knew it meant a lot for Faith to help out as a way of making up for all that
she had done in the past.</p>

<p>"So no more black cloud looming over the dorm?" Buffy asked as she walked
over to Faith and allowed herself to be pulled into the brunette's strong
arms.</p>

<p>Missy happily sat down on her bed and shook her head no as she admired the
way Buffy and Faith seemed to fit together, as if they were made for each
other. She sighed to herself, remembering the time when she got to hold
Cordelia like that. As brief as their time together was, it had meant a
great deal to her. But there were other things now. Feelings for another
someone, that she felt she shouldn't be having. That she felt guilty for
having. But Faith was right; it was time to get over it. After all, this was
college and one's supposed to have fun in college.</p>

<p>Buffy turned in Faith's arms and reached up to give her a quick kiss before
smiling sweetly at her. "Since you're so good with the cheering up thing,
why don't you go fix Willow?" Buffy frowned. "I think Oz broke her."</p>

<p>"Sorry B, but you know Red and I aren't that close." Faith paused and kissed
her girlfriend's forehead before turning to look at Missy. "But who could
cheer her up better than someone who knows her pain?"</p>

<p>"And they did look awfully cute cuddled together that one night," Buffy
supplied, unsure of why she actually did it.</p>

<p>Missy's eyes widened as if to give a look that said, 'Who? Me?' to the two
slayers. "Neither of us can do any good so why can't you at least try?"</p>

<p>"I'll pout," Buffy added with a smile as she looked from Missy to Faith.</p>

<p>Faith's grin grew as she looked down at her girlfriend. "Don't make her
pout," Faith warned Missy. "It's impossible to refuse her when she pouts."
Faith gave Buffy a smile before turning her attention to Missy. "Then again,
she looks adorable when she pouts. And since it won't be me she's pouting
at, go ahead and make her pout."</p>

<p>Missy just rolled her eyes at the two as she stood back up. "I'll go, but
don't expect much." Both slayers eyes lit up as they watched Missy walk out
the door. For one, they were glad that she was actually acting human again
and they were both hopeful that she'd be able to cheer Willow up some.</p>

<p>"Think she'll be able to do it?" Buffy asked as she pulled Faith closer to
her. The blonde buried her face in her girlfriend's neck.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I've got other things on my mind now," Faith said
huskily, finally glad to have the blonde alone in their room.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell me about them?" Buffy questioned as she sat down on her
bed, pulling Faith into her lap.</p>

<p>"Never thought you liked the dirty talk B," Faith whispered as she brought
her lips just so they were inches from Buffy's.</p>

<p>"Why don't you find out?" Buffy asked breathlessly just seconds before
kissing her girlfriend passionately.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Willow," Missy smiled at the red head as she opened the door to her
dorm room. "Could we talk for a minute?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, come on in," Willow responded as she moved to the side, allowing
Missy entrance to her room. When Missy walked in she noticed that Tara was
there, along with another girl she didn't recognize. "Oh, that's Amy,"
Willow stated as she noticed the brunette's confusion.</p>

<p>"I was the pet rat," Amy said as she held out her hand to Missy.</p>

<p>Missy accepted it, and shook the girls hand, trying to figure out what was
really going on. "You k-know Willow's a lot more p-powerful when she's
upset," Tara stated softly as she stood from the floor. "We should probably
get you home," Tara said softly, looking at Amy.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that'd probably be a good idea," Amy agreed with the blonde Wicca.
The two said their goodbyes, both giving Willow tight hugs before they left,</p>

<p>"So they sent you over huh?" Willow asked softly as she sat down on her bed,
patting the spot next to her. Missy took the invitation and sat down Indian
style next to Willow.</p>

<p>"Yeah, they figured since we've both been out of it maybe we'd be able to
cheer each other up. I think they just wanted to, you know," Missy said as
she made little motions with her hands, indicating what she was thinking of.
Willow got the picture and turned a few different shades of red. "So you've
been working on the magic thing lately huh?" Missy asked, and Willow was
grateful for the change of subject.</p>

<p>"It gives me something to concentrate on. And when I'm concentrating I can't
think about all the not so good stuff. It helps," Willow supplied.</p>

<p>"I think Tara's got a crush on you," Missy said with a smile as she nudged
Willow. "Have you seen the way she looks at you?"</p>

<p>Willow looked thoughtful for a moment before smiling at Missy. "I think she
looks at everyone like that. I know I saw her looking at Amy like that. But
even if she did like me I wouldn't… Not that there's anything wrong with it
or anything because Buffy and Faith and the you and Cordy thing and that was
all fine and dandy you know? I don't mind that people are or anything and
I'm all for it it's just that if I were…" Willow trailed off, obviously at a
fault for words.  She looked up at Missy hesitantly, hoping the brunette
would get what she was trying to convey without her having to actually speak
the words.</p>

<p>When she felt Missy's lips softly pressing against hers, she tensed for a
second, before relaxing and kissing the brunette back. It was barely more
than just a peck, but that's all they needed now. "I know why you've been
hiding Willow. It's the same reason I have been. I feel guilty about it,
especially since you've been hurting and I'm still hurting a little over
Cordy, but I think about you. About holding you like I did that one night. I
tried avoiding you, wishing it to go away, but it didn't. And I can't really
avoid you forever."</p>

<p>"Its just Oz. Oz was such a big part of everything, of me for so long. And
now he's gone. And I feel like I'm supposed to stay sad longer. But
sometimes I think about you and I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Then maybe we could just go slow?" Missy asked as she took Willow's hand
into her own. Willow nodded in agreement just before Missy captured her lips
for the second time. This kiss was a little longer than the first, but still
short. "Hey, lets go bug Buffy and Faith," Missy said with a wicked smile.</p>

<p>"But I thought they were," Willow paused to make the same motions with her
hands that Missy did earlier while blushing again.</p>

<p>"Exactly my point," Missy replied as she stood up, bringing Willow with her.
The red head just sighed, but followed Missy none the less. At least things
would never get boring for her she thought to herself.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Missy and Willow reached the brunette's dorm room Missy stopped to
knock on the door. As fun as it might be for her to catch Faith and Buffy in
the act just to piss them off, she knew if Willow saw them the girl would
probably loose all cohearant thought for the next few days. When she heard
Faith's angry reply to her knocking she smiled to herself. "It's important
guys. I'm giving you two minutes and then we're coming in." Missy yelled
into the door. When she heard the two slayers grumbling on the other side of
the door she smiled proudly to Willow.</p>

<p>Finally the time was up, and Missy walked into her room holding Willow's
hand in hers. "I think I unbroke her," Missy said playfully as she let go of
Willow's hand and sat down on her bed. Both slayers noticed the red head's
sudden shyness as she sat down next to Missy, and for a moment Buffy thought
she saw a glimpse of the Willow she first met back in 10th grade.</p>

<p>"Okay you two, what's going on?" Faith asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>Much to Willow's relief, the phone rang just then and Buffy answered it
before Missy got to answer the question. It's not that she didn't want her
friends to know what just happened, but didn't slow mean keeping it to
yourself for just a little bit? But then as soon as she felt Missy's hand
slide into her own her fear of her friends reactions dissipated. It wasn't
that she was afraid of telling them she had developed feelings for Missy, it
was just that she thought they might look down on her for trying to move on
from Oz after only a few weeks.</p>

<p>"It's for you," Buffy said as she handed Missy the phone. Missy looked
confused, wondering who would be calling her, and from the look on Buffy's
face she had a good idea of who it might be. She took the phone after
hesitating for a few seconds and took a deep breath before speaking.</p>

<p>"Hello?" she asked, and she wasn't surprised when she heard Cordelia's voice
on the other end of the reciever. "Hey Cordy. What's going on?" Missy asked
softly. She looked over at Willow, who seemed to be a little nervous and she
tightened her hold on the red heads hand just a little, and began to softly
rub her thumb in small circles on the back of her hand in reassurance.</p>

<p>"I figured I'd try to call you. We haven't talked since that message I left
you when I got home. I've left you a lot and you never called back,"
Cordelia said sadly. "I'm sorry," she added almost silently.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry too," Missy said, feeling very awkward about having this
conversation with three people in the room. Especially one she thought to be
her new girlfriend, or something close to. "There's been a lot of stuff to
think about you know? It hurt but I've dealt." She paused and looked from
Willow to the two slayers on the other bed. "I've found someone myself," she
said with a smile.</p>

<p>Willow blushed slightly as Missy said that, feeling almost proud that Missy
told Cordelia about that when she knew the brunette still had some feelings
for the ex cheerleader. She didn't even know if she'd be able to tell Oz
something like that so soon, assuming she ever talked to him.</p>

<p>"It's Willow isn't it?" Cordelia asked, and a little of her guilt floated
away.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's her. She's kinda here now though so I can't really talk long.
But let me say one thing first okay?" She stopped for a minute, and could
almost see Cordelia nodding her head even though she wasn't speaking. "If he
ever hurts you, big scary vampire or not, I'll beat the shit out of him."</p>

<p>All three girls in the room with her laughed, along with Cordelia who was on
the other end of the line. "Fine, if he does that I promise not to stop you
from staking him okay?" Cordelia asked happily.</p>

<p>"Hey I heard that," Missy heard what she assumed to be Angel chuckling in
the background and it caused her to laugh too.</p>

<p>"So we can still be friends?" Cordelia asked quietly, still feeling
uncomfortable about showing she actually cared.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to pull a you here and say 'Duh'?" Missy asked jokingly. "Of
course we can be friends." Missy smiled, glad to be having this conversation
so she could put her weekend with Cordy behind her and truely focus on what
she was feeling for Willow.</p>

<p>"Okay, good," Cordelia said, and Missy could tell she was satisfied with the
answer. "I'm gonna go pout at Angel to take me shopping now," Cordelia said.
"Tell Willow to take care of you okay?"</p>

<p>"Will do. Take care," Missy said. The two finished their goodbyes, and as
soon as Missy hung the phone up she noticed two sets of slayer eyes watching
her intently. "What?" she asked innocently.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Faith smirked as she looked at Missy. "What's up with
you two."</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Missy replied, matching Faith's smirks with one of her
own. "I know your not the brightest crayon in the box, but it doesn't take a
brain surgeon." Willow blushed again at that, and Buffy studied her best
friend. It didn't take the blonde long to figure out that whatever Willow
was feeling for Missy, it was growing fast, which was clearly shown by the
ammount of her blushing.</p>

<p>"Hey, you remember what  I did to you ealier?" Faith asked, trying to
actually sound threatening. "Don't make me have to embarass you in front of
Red like that."</p>

<p>Missy rolled her eyes as she stood up, and offered her hand to Willow. "You
don't scare me," she said playfully. She then turned her attention back to
Willow and gave her a sheepish smile. "You wanna maybe go out or something?"
she asked softly, slightly embarassed to be doing this in front of her two
roomates.</p>

<p>"Like a date?" Willow asked, just as shyly. Missy nodded, wondering when it
was that she became shy as she smiled at Willow. "Sure," Willow said as she
stood up from Missy's bed.</p>

<p>"Well aren't you two cute," Faith teased. Buffy swatted her in the arm and
looked at her two friends.</p>

<p>"Ignore her. She's just uhh.. What are you?" Buffy asked as she looked at
her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"I Faith. You Buffy," the brunette replied jokingly. All four of them burst
into laughter at that and when they finally calmed down Missy and Willow
excused themselves and set off for their first date.</p>

<p>Faith laid back in the bed, and Buffy wasted no time in making heself
comfortable in her girlfriend's arms. "Whatcha thinking about?" Faith asked
as she noticed the far away look on the blondes face.</p>

<p>"Just trying to figure Missy out," Buffy replied as she let her fingers
trace patters on Faith's stomach.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Faith asked as she watched Buffy's fingers on her
stomach intently.</p>

<p>"Just look at all she's done for the gang. And without even knowing it,"
Buffy paused, trying to find a way to put her thoughts into words. "She
showed up, and I thought she was you. I probably would have never talked to
you again if it weren't for her. And now look at what we have. This great
incredible thing that would have probably happened if it weren't for her.
And then she gets Willow to forgive you. I think even in that brief thing
she had with Cordelia, she did some good for her. It's like she just comes
into peoples lives and makes them better without even knowing it."</p>

<p>Faith smiled, knowing that there was a lot of truth to Buffy's words. Missy
had came into all of their lives, turned things upside down and made them
better. "Yeah, you're right," Faith said as she kissed the top of Buffy's
head. "But I'd like to believe we would have found each other on our own
eventually anyways."</p>

<p>"Me too," Buffy replied softly. "How do you think her and Willow will do?"</p>

<p>"I think they'll be fine," Faith told her girlfriend. "I think for both of
them, when they go into something they give it their all. I think everything
will be just fine from now on," Faith whispered, almost as if she were
trying to convince herself of that.</p>

<p>"You know I love you right?" Buffy questioned as she propped herself up to
look at Faith.</p>

<p>Faith nodded, and gave the blonde a soft kiss. "I love you too. And remind
me to thank Missy some time for all she's done."</p>

<p>"Okay. But first, I'd rather thank you," Buffy said seductively.</p>

<p>"For what?" Faith asked, hardly able to think as she felt Buffy's hands
start to roam over her body.</p>

<p>"For loving me," Buffy replied as she dipped down to give Faith a tender
kiss. When she pulled away she smiled at the dazed look Faith had on her
face. "Now what do you say we make up for that interruption before?" Buffy
didn't even wait for Faith's response and began trailing kisses along
Faith's jawline.</p>

<p>"Sounds like the perfect ending to the night," Faith finally managed to get
out.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped her minstrations and looked into Faith's eyes. "The perfect
ending. I like the sound of that," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Me too B. And I think we may just get one." Faith reached over and shut of
the lamp beside the bed just before pulling Buffy back into her arms with
every intention of showing the blonde just how perfect all of this really
was.</p>
