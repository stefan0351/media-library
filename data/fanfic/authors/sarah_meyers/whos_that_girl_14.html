<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 13 -->

<p>"Again, what the hell was that?" Torrance asked as Missy walked up to her.</p>

<p>"That was my girl going back to LA," Missy said, giving Torrance a 'duh'
look. Missy shook her head; already knowing that was something she picked up
from Cordelia. "Well she's not really my girl yet but maybe one day if we
decide that's what we want."</p>

<p>"What the hell has happened to you since you've come here?" Torrance asked
as the two hugged.</p>

<p>"A lot of stuff you probably wouldn’t believe. This is Willow by the way,"
Missy said as she pointed to the red head that was silently standing by. The
two shook hands and Willow noticed that Missy kept looking around them.</p>

<p>"Where's Cliff?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he stayed back at your parents. I only came up here for the day to see
you," Torrance replied.</p>

<p>"Well don't I feel special then?" Missy asked with a smile as she linked
arms with Torrance.</p>

<p>"You should. It's not everyday that someone has a best friend as perfect as
me." Missy shook her head and Willow laughed at that.</p>

<p>"Hey Willow, what are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"I figured I'd go watch the guys practice. There's nothing else to do around
here," she smiled at them.</p>

<p>"Cool. Mind if we tag along? It'd be the only cool thing in this town I
could actually show Torr."</p>

<p>"You're going to explain that kissing thing to me on the way right? Because
last time I checked-"</p>

<p>"Les was the only gay one. Yeah, I know." Missy paused to laugh. "This is a
strange town Torr. Anything's possible when you're here." With that Willow
let herself get amused as she led the two to the Dingoes practice.</p>

<hr>

<p>While Codelia drove back to LA Tara spent most of the trip lost in thought
about Willow and Oz. She had taken an immediate liking to the red head but
she knew that she was also deeply in love with Oz. "Cordelia?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" she responded in a slightly annoyed voice, unhappy to be brought out
of her thoughts of Missy.</p>

<p>"D-do you know Oz really well?" the shy blonde asked.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Cordy replied as she turned her radio down some. "I guess, I've known
him since high school but we aren't really the closest people in the world.
Why?"</p>

<p>"H-he loves Willow a lot right?" Tara questioned, remembering the way he had
been entranced by Veruca that night at the Bronze.</p>

<p>Cordelia gave Tara a funny look, and then finally smiled at her. "You've got
a crush on Willow don't you?" Tara blushed furiously and nodded slightly not
bothering to lie to Cordelia. "Yeah, he loves her a lot. Even after she
cheated on him he still loved her," Cordelia said sadly remembering when
Willow and Xander had cheated on both of them.</p>

<p>"She cheated on him?" Tara asked, surprised that Willow would ever do
something like that.</p>

<p>"Yeah, with my boyfriend at the time. It wasn't a nice situation. But Oz is
really dedicated to her. But you never know. In a town like Sunnydale,
anything’s capable of happening," Cordelia said with a reassuring smile.
"But first we need to work on this shyness thing of yours."</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith sat on the blonde's old bed back at her mom's house trying
to throw jelly beans in each other's mouths. "What flavor was that?" Faith
asked excitedly as she managed to get one into Buffy's mouth.</p>

<p>"Why don't you find out?" Buffy asked as she moved closer to Faith. Faith
just grinned at her girlfriend before kissing her deeply. As she slid her
tongue into Buffy's mouth she could taste the popcorn flavored jelly bean.
Faith broke the kiss immediately and wrinkled her nose in distaste. "Those
are the gross ones," she informed Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy let out a small laugh and shook her head at Faith. "Well it's better
than cleaning the place up," she said.</p>

<p>"I suppose, but there's still some things better than this," Faith told
Buffy as she gave the blonde a small kiss. "We haven't had enough alone time
since we got together you know," she smiled seductively at Buffy.</p>

<p>"And just what do you suggest?" Buffy asked as she started placing kisses on
Faith's neck.</p>

<p>"Well I was thinking about a shower first of all," Faith replied as she slid
her fingers under Buffy's chin and lifted the blonde's face to hers. "Then
we could come back here and have some fun," Faith whispered before kissing
the blonde.</p>

<p>After the kiss broke Buffy pulled stood up and smiled at Faith. "Sounds like
a plan," Faith's eyes lit up at her girlfriend’s words and she quickly stood
up as well. "After we clean the place up," Buffy said with a grin.</p>

<p>Faith grumbled slightly in protest as she followed Buffy down the stairs.
"How do you think Missy's doing now that Queen C left?" Buffy let out a
small laugh after Faith said that. "What?" Faith asked defensively.</p>

<p>"Well Missy's the only one you haven't given a nickname to yet. It's just
cute. And now your all like caring and stuff." Buffy teased her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Isn't that how you want me to be?" Faith asked as she raised an eyebrow.
"Besides, she looks like me. So it's like she's kinda me but not or
something really weird like that that I haven't really figured out yet."</p>

<p>Buffy laughed even harder at that as she kissed her girlfriend. "Well I'm
sure Missy's going to be just fine. Cordy too. I always thought Cordy would
get with Angel actually. I really don't see her liking girls, but then I
never thought I would either until I found you." Buffy said giving Faith
another kiss. "Now lets get this cleaning done so we can have that shower."</p>

<hr>

<p>Willow, along with Missy and Torrance, walked into the Bronze finding it
unusually quiet since the Dingoes were supposed to be practicing their set
for their next show. Missy was busy explaining to Torrance that the Bronze
was the only place actually worthwhile to go to in Sunnydale. When the three
got closer to the stage they all noticed the guys were all sitting around,
except for one who was leaning against the wall talking to another girl.</p>

<p>Missy recognized the girl as the one who had been singing there before, and
she noticed that the girl seemed to be just a little too close to Oz for
even her liking. As she looked at Willow she noticed the red head was
thinking the same thing. She kept waiting for Willow to go approach her
boyfriend, but she just stood in her place, watching him instead. Finally
she decided to stop looking at the red head and turned back to Oz.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Torrance asked quietly, noticing the tense state her
friend just got in.</p>

<p>Before anyone could answer however they all saw Veruca as she stepped even
closer to Oz and pressed her lips to his. Willow let out a small gasp, and
when Missy turned her attention back to the red head she noticed that she
was already in tears. Missy cleared her throat rather loudly, getting Oz's
attention and he immediately pushed Veruca away from him.</p>

<p>As soon as he faced Willow the red head turned around and ran out of the
Bronze. He called out to her, and tried to go after her but Missy stopped
him. "Let her go," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to loose her," he said calmly.</p>

<p>"I think you already have," she replied. "Come on Torr, we gotta go find
her." Torrance nodded at her and followed the brunette out of the Bronze,
thinking she had obviously picked a really bad day to come visit her best
friend. Oz stood by helplessly as he watched the two of them leave, sadly
realizing that what Missy said was most likely true. It wasn’t because he
was just kissing someone else, they’d gotten through something like that
before but he knew fully well this was different. Veruca was different.</p>
