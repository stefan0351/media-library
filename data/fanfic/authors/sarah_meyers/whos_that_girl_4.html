<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 3 -->

<p>"You know, since your so gung ho about tasting a slayers blood, you might
want to try finding a real slayer," Buffy said as she walked up to the
vampire that was pinning Missy down. The other vampire that was with him
quickly ran away upon seeing Buffy knowing full well that two slayers would
be too much for him and his friend to handle. The vampire that remained
growled at her but paid no more attention to her. Just as the vamp began to
lower his mouth to Missy, Buffy kicked him in the ribs, which sent him
flying a few feet back. Buffy glanced at Missy quickly to make sure she was
okay and threw that necklace to her. "Put it on," she instructed. "And don't
take it off this time."</p>

<p>While she was talking to Missy the vampire managed to sneak up behind her
and throw her on the ground. Buffy quickly swept his feet out from under him
and before she was even all the way back on her feet Mr. Pointy was firmly
placed into the vamp's heart. "Poof he goes," Buffy said with a small smile.
  She walked over to Missy and helped her stand. "You okay?" Buffy asked as
she looked over Missy for any wounds.</p>

<p>Missy was still trying to register what she had just seen.  Her body was
shaking slightly from either the cool night air, or just becoming that close
to being vampire chow and Buffy noticed. The blonde pulled her roommate into
a hug in an attempt to help her calm down a little bit. "You're going to
explain this to me right?" Missy asked softly as she let Buffy embrace her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I will." Buffy let go of Missy and felt a pain rising in the pit of
her stomach as she looked the girl over. She knew Missy wasn't Faith but
just because they looked so much alike she couldn't help but feel more
attached to Missy than she probably should. "You know what that was right?"
Buffy asked as she started leading the way back to school. Missy nodded, and
as they passed a few more people walking down the street she moved closer to
Buffy afraid that any of these people could be vampires. Buffy noticed this,
and took the taller girl's hand into her own to offer support.</p>

<p>"Well there are a lot of vampires and other such demons in Sunnydale. I once
thought that they were make believe too, but unfortunately they are real.
I'm what's called the 'slayer' and my job is to kill them and stop all their
end of the world type plans."</p>

<p>"Faith was a slayer too right?" Missy asked when she remembered what the
vampires said to her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she was called after…" Buffy's voice trailed off and she turned her
attention away from Missy. After a few moments of silence she began to speak
again. "There can only be one slayer at a time, or at least that's how it's
supposed to work. The new one is called after the previous one dies. I died
for a few minutes, and then Xander revived me. Kendra was still called
however, but then she died and Faith was called. A little much huh?"</p>

<p>"I guess. Of course, if your telling me demons and vampires exist, that
means Torr might have been right about her spirit stick curse," Missy said
with a laugh. Now that she had calmed down a bit from her scare with the
vampire Missy finally realized Buffy was holding her hand still, but didn't
say anything about it.</p>

<p>"Spirit stick curse?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Last year I transferred to a new school because my family moved. I was a
gymnast but the school I had to go to didn't have a team so I became a
cheerleader. Torrance, my best friend became captain that year and
everything went wrong and she said it was all because of the spirit stick
curse."</p>

<p>"Oh," Buffy said, sounding a little confused.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy, how come you put Faith in a coma?" Missy asked out of the blue
and Buffy looked at her with uncertainty. "I know we just met a few hours
ago, and I'm not trying to pry into your life or anything I was just kind of
curious."</p>

<p>Buffy let go of Missy's hand and started walking up the stairs to their dorm
room with the brunette following behind her. She didn't say anything to
Missy, but instead got lost in thought for the next few minutes. She wasn't
sure why, but she really wanted to tell Missy everything about what
happened. Maybe it was partly because she looked so much like Faith, but
mostly just because she knew even though she wanted to she couldn't talk to
the Scooby gang about this. They still hated Faith too much, despite the
fact that it was Faith who saved them all at graduation by telling Buffy
about the mayor still having his human weakness. It would be nice to have
someone neutral to talk to, to confide in and just to be friends with.</p>

<p>As the two walked into their dorm room Buffy sat down on her bed and picked
the small picture of Faith up off her night stand. "You really want to know
the whole story?" she asked Missy.</p>

<p>Missy nodded as she sat down on her bed and started pulling off her shoes.
"You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want. It's not like we've
really known each other that long or anything."</p>

<p>"I kind of want to tell you," Buffy said. "I haven't been able to talk to
anyone about any of this and it'd be kind of nice to be able to say what I
really think without being afraid of my friends getting mad at me."</p>

<p>"Why would they be mad?" Missy asked as she lay on her bed.</p>

<p>"Because they hate Faith still, but I can't seem to stay mad at her for the
stuff she did. I always felt so free around her. It was like she was a
sister or something to me. But then one night when we were out slaying, she
accidentally killed a human." Buffy continued her story, telling Missy about
Faith joining the mayor, trying to kill angel and the only cure to the
poison she shot in him being a slayers blood. Then she explained about her
and Faith's shared dream from when the two were both in the hospital and how
she stopped the mayor at graduation.</p>

<p>When she finished her story she noticed Missy was just looking at her wide
eyed, obviously having a little bit of trouble believing the whole story. "I
umm… Geez, what do I even say to that?" Missy asked.</p>

<p>"You could tell me you believe me and don't think I'm freak of the month?"
Buffy offered with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well yeah, I believe you. I'd be kind of silly not to considering what
happened to me tonight. Torr is going to flip when I tell her there actually
is something in the world more evil than Big Red."</p>

<p>"Big Red?" Buffy asked as she lay down on her bed.</p>

<p>"She was the captain of the cheerleading team before Torrance. When I
transferred to that school Torr was already captain, but Big Red had stolen
another school's cheers and it just caused a lot of trouble for all of us.
She liked to make people's lives hell from what I hear. Hey! Since you fight
evil why don't you go kill her?" Missy asked jokingly.</p>

<p>Buffy laughed at that, before she realized something. "Did she have red
hair?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" was Missy's only response.</p>

<p>"This Big Red person, did she get that nickname because she had red hair?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess. Why?" Missy questioned as she tried to not get confused over
this.</p>

<p>"Well Faith used to call Willow 'Red' because of her hair color. Just made
me think of her I guess." Buffy said quietly.</p>

<p>"You should go see her," Missy said as she pulled some of her night clothes
from her dresser. "I think it would help you to go talk to her, even if she
can't respond. It'd be a way for you to get everything off your chest
without worrying what she'll say or do. Then when she wakes up from her
coma, maybe you two would be able to work things out and be friends again."</p>

<p>"I don't think we could. She'll probably just push me away again. There's so
much between us that I don't think we could ever mend our friendship."</p>

<p>"Don't give me that crap. I'll give you the same advice I once gave my
brother, be aggressive. If she tries to push you away, don't let her. Got
him the girl, it'll get you yours too. Guaranteed." Buffy gave Missy a
curious look after she said that, wondering what she meant about getting the
girl but Missy only shrugged and climbed under the covers of her bed.</p>

<p>Buffy threw on her night clothes and climbed into her bed, wondering why
Missy was so intent on getting her to talk to Faith. She shut of the small
lamp in between the two beds and lay in the dark hoping that Missy would be
right. Hoping that just maybe, it wasn't too late for her and Faith to try
and start their friendship over again.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Missy," Buffy said as she got out of bed.</p>

<p>"Who the hell is Missy?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her roommate intently, wondering what was going on. "Faith?"
Buffy asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>"The one and only," Faith said sitting down at the end of Buffy's bed. "Miss
me?"</p>

<p>"How?" Buffy questioned, unable to find any other words.</p>

<p>"Dunno B. It's your head we're in, not mine."</p>

<p>"So then it's a dream?" Buffy asked and Faith nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm still in coma land, so it's gotta be a dream." Faith sprawled out on
Buffy's bed and smiled at her. "Is this like one of those slayer dreams or
something? Because normally when I dream about you, you're kicking my ass."</p>

<p>"You dream about me?" Buffy asked softly.</p>

<p>"Well I'd call them more like nightmares but yeah," Faith replied as she
shrugged. "Wish the damn hospital would just let me die already. I'm sick of
reliving my past all the time in my head. I'm pretty fucked up you know?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about coming to see you tomorrow." Buffy decided to ignore
Faith's comment about being fucked up because it would only lead them to
fighting. She would tell Faith she wasn't, Faith would insist that she was
and it would end up going on forever.</p>

<p>"Why? So you can come and laugh at me, or admire what you've done to me? Or
maybe just to ease your guilt? Thanks, but no thanks B. You’re the one who
put me there and I'd appreciate it if you just left me to die."</p>

<p>"No Faith, I don't want to do that. I just want us to be friends again. It's
not too late for us to start again. I know we hurt each other pretty bad but
you still came through for us in the end. I'm sorry Faith."</p>

<p>"Don't sweat it B," Faith said trying to sound like she didn't really care.
"We're enemies now B. Things can never be the same. It's better this way
anyways. I don't fit in with you and your friends."</p>

<p>"No it's not better Faith. Nothing's better than us being friends again,"
Buffy told her as Missy's earlier words about being aggressive stuck in her
mind. "I learn from my mistakes Faith, and this time I'm not giving up on
you no matter what."</p>

<p>"So you're forgiving me, just like that?" Faith questioned, unsure of why
this was happening.</p>

<p>"If you forgive me for what I did, then yeah, I forgive you," Buffy said
with a smile. Faith turned her gaze to the floor and Buffy could tell that
the younger slayer was giving it thought. Finally after a few minutes, Faith
nodded her head and smiled at Buffy.</p>

<p>"If you think we can do it B. I can't make any promises that I won't fuck up
again though. So why with the sudden forgiveness bit anyways?" Faith
questioned as she felt Buffy's hand move on top of her own. Buffy opened her
mouth as if to speak, but she closed it again as she noticed the things in
the room begin to fade. "Hey, are you serious about coming to see me
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think I'll stop by after class. How come?"</p>

<p>"Well you think you could tell me why you're forgiving me then?" Buffy
looked at her confused after she said that and she smiled for the first time
in the dream. "I'm kind of like celery B. You know how they say plants can
actually feel things? Well I don't know if it's true or not 'cuz I'm no
scholar but if it is, then I'm celery. Well is celery even a plant?
Anyways," Faith stopped and laughed which caused Buffy to smile in return.
"I can hear and feel things, but I just can't respond to them in any sort of
way yet. So like if you go there and talk to me I can hear everything you
say."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded and gave Faith a quick hug. "I'll see you tomorrow Faith."</p>

<p>"Yeah, B. Thanks for the second chance and all," she said just before Buffy
and the dream disappeared from her.</p>
