<!-- Second Chance \ Part 6 -->

<p>Man, I have really missed Sunday morning cartoons. Even better,
there's an X-men marathon on this morning. When B woke up I had to explain
why they're so great. I can't believe she didn't get it. At least she went
to go make breakfast. I could definitely get used to this family stuff.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little bit too old to be watching cartoons?"</p>

<p>Guess I'll have to explain the wonders of X-men to Dawn too. "Come on
Dawnie, it's X-men," I say as I pat the spot on the couch next to me. She
sits and I start explaining all the characters to her. I can't believe
they've never watched this before.</p>

<p>B comes in laughing, and sits down on my lap. "Did you brush your teeth
Dawn?" she asks interrupting me. "You'll be here all day if you let her go
on. I only got out of it because I promised food." She kisses me before
heading back into the kitchen and I stick my tongue out at her.</p>

<p>"So anyways, I learned all I need to know in life from cartoons." I smile
proudly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and it got you far too huh?" I'm not sure what she really meant by
that. Whether she meant my new family and all I have now, or my time in
jail. But being me, I took it to mean the later, and I guess she realized
it. "I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry Faith."</p>

<p>"It's fine," I say, and I can see in her eyes that she didn't really mean
it. That's just how teenagers are. They speak without actually thinking
first. Hell, I still do that most of the time.</p>

<p>I walk into the kitchen to find the most adorable thing I've ever
seen. B's got some music on and she's singing into a big wooden spoon thats
dripping pancake batter.  I walk up behind her and start singing along as I
wrap my arms around her waist.</p>

<p>"Commercial break or something?" she asks as she turns around to kiss me
once more.</p>

<p>"Nah. I'm gonna go out for a walk or something. I need to clear my head." I
sit up on the counter and she looks at me like Miss S used to so I quickly
get down.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" I don't know why, but for some reason what Dawn said to me
really bothered me, and I just need to think. Guess I should tell her that,
but for some reason I don't. Maybe it was to protect Dawn because I'm sure B
wouldn't be happy with her saying that either.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I just wanna go for a walk okay?" She looks a little hurt and I
feel bad in an instant. I'm still not used to that whole care and share
thing. "I'll be back in a while. I love you," I say kissing her quickly.</p>

<p>"I love you too," she smiles at me as I walk out the door.</p>

<p>Somehow I end up at the park. I almost wanted to hit the nearest store and
buy some JD, but I know drinking won't do anything. For a few minutes my
reasoning skills went back to the way they were before jail. Dawn looks at
me like I'm shit, so I show her what shit I can be. But as I learned in
jail, that kind of thinking doesn't get me anywhere. Besides, if anyone
really loves me, it's Dawn and I know she didn't really mean it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how long I've been out and I feel bad because I'm sure B's
worried about me but I don't feel like going back yet. As I turn the corner
into the park, who do I run into other than Red and Blondie. Some luck I
have this morning. Guess there's no time like the present to try and make
amends huh?</p>

<p>"Hey Red, Blondie," I say nodding to the two of them.</p>

<p>"Her name's Tara, and mine's Willow. Or are two syllable words too big for
you?"</p>

<p>"That hurts," I say as I sit down on a bench next to them.</p>

<p>"Yeah well you deserve a lot more than just that." Okay, obviously this is
going to be harder than I thought.</p>

<p>"Look Willow, I'm not here to make trouble. Buffy's the one who wanted me
to come back. For what it's worth, I'm sorry for all the stuff I did."</p>

<p>"It certainly isn't worth much to me." She gets up and holds her hand out
to Tara. You know, the girl is as sweet as can be when she's your friend,
but she's one hell of a bitch when she doesn't like you.</p>

<p>"Personally, I don't give a rat's ass if you like me or not Willow. I just
want us to play nice for B's sake."</p>

<p>"Y-yes you do," finally Tara speaks up. "I can tell you want us to be
friends. It's in your eyes." And all this time I thought B was the only one
who could do that whole knowing what I'm thinking by looking at my eyes
thing. Guess maybe it's a witchy thing too or something.</p>

<p>"Your wrong Tara. Faith has no feelings," Willow takes her girlfriends hand
and tries to get her to stand up but she doesn't.</p>

<p>"I know I didn't go through what everyone else did, but I forgive you."
Tara smiled at me and Willow looked like she was about to explode. Somehow I
manage not to laugh, knowing that wouldn't really help my cause any.</p>

<p>"Thanks Tara. I really do mean it Willow. I'm sorry. Just think about it at
least okay? Now if you don't mind, I gotta make sure B didn't burn the house
down. I hear she isn't much of a cook." I wink at the two of them and walk
off.</p>

<p>Suddenly what Dawn said to me earlier doesn't seem bad. I think the only
reason her remark bothered me was because it was true. But hey, maybe if I
hadn't fucked up so bad I would never have what I do today. Point is,
there's not point in dwelling on the past. I've got a future now and that's
all I need to worry about.</p>

<p>On the way back to B's I pass some little flower shop and decide that a
peace offering is in order. After all, I did skip out on mine and B's first
breakfast together and I hear girls like flowers. I get a dozen red rozes
for B, and notice they've got some orange roses too. I'm not really sure if
they mean anything like red means love, but they're cool so I grab a half
dozen of them for the kid. I guess I ought to get used to spoiling them now,
because even if I end up broke I love seeing them smile.</p>

<p>When I get back home I realize the front door is locked and I'm still
without a key. I've got my hands full, but somehow I manage to ring the
doorbell and Dawn's quickly at the door smiling at me. "Miss me?"</p>

<p>"Are you still mad at me?" she asks and her smile fades. I walk in the
house and just shake my head at her.</p>

<p>"Actually, I was hoping you'd forgive me for taking it the wrong way." I
pull out her flowers from behind my back and I swear I've never seen her
smile so big before. She practically jumps on me and gives me a big bear
hug. "Where's B at?"</p>

<p>"She's in the kitchen cleaning up the breakfast you didn't eat," she pokes
me in the ribs and I notice the evil gleam in her eye.</p>

<p>"I'm in trouble for leaving huh?"</p>

<p>"Yup," she smiles at me then takes off to her room. Let's just hope the
flowers go over as smoothly with B as they did Dawn.</p>

<p>"Uhh... Honey I'm home," I say softly peaking my head into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hey," she says flatly before turning her attention back to the dishes.</p>

<p>"I brought you something," I walk up behind her and wrap my arms around her
waist holding the roses in front of her. "I'm sorry for taking off this
morning. I just needed to think about something."</p>

<p>"You really want to make it up to me?" She turns around in my arms and I
notice she's got that same evil gleam in her eyes that Dawn did just a few
moments before. They're definitely up to something.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" I half state, half ask unsure of what I'm about to get myself into.</p>

<p>"Well you can start by taking me and Dawn to the mall." She stops and gives
me a quick kiss before she takes off to search the cabinets for a vase.
"Then tonight you can tell my why you took off this morning and we can
finally talk about all that stuff in your journal."</p>

<p>"Guess I don't have much say in the matter do I?" I ask meekly.</p>

<p>"Nope," she smiles at me again and Dawn chooses that moment to walk into
the kitchen. "You ready yet?"</p>

<p>Dawn nods and I just sigh. It's going to be a long day. I can handle the
whole dealing with the past thing tonight, but taking both the Summers girls
to the mall is like murder. What can I say, I'm just not the shopping type.</p>
