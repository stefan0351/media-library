<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 2 -->

<p>"What?" Missy asked as she noticed the way her roommate was looking at her.
Even though she didn't know the whole story about Faith, or really anything
about Buffy at all she had already determined that she'd help the blonde
realize why Faith's betrayal had hurt her so much.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," Buffy said as she blushed a little. "It's just that you
look so much like her. It'll take some time to get used to is all." Buffy
noticed Missy's thoughtful expression and looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Tell me again why I have to wear this?" Missy asked as she grabbed onto
the cross that Buffy told her to wear before they left their dorm room. She
decided that since her and Buffy had just met, prying about Faith wasn't
something she should do yet.</p>

<p>"Just humor me for a few hours," Buffy said as she walked into the Bronze
with her new roommate. "You'll see why later," she then added. "Now
remember, my friends are going to freak out when they see you so just be
patient while I explain to them okay?"</p>

<p>"Okay," Missy responded as she looked around the Bronze, wondering if this
was the only place to hang out at in this small town. Its crowd was a
mixture of mostly older high school and younger college students. Before
Missy had a chance to finish her thoughts she felt Buffy tugging on her arm,
leading her to one of the tables on the opposite side of the Bronze.</p>

<p>The two approached the table where Willow, Oz, and Xander were sitting.
Xander was talking with an excited look on his face, most likely about the
cross country trip he had just returned from, and Oz was looking at him with
his expression of indifference on his face though he seemed to be into what
Xander was saying since none of them noticed the arrival of Buffy and her
new roommate.</p>

<p>"Hey guys," Buffy said getting her friends attention as she grabbed Missy's
hand and stood in front of the slightly taller girl.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffster, how've you…" Xander's words fell silent as he got up to hug
Buffy and noticed the girl that was standing behind her. Oz and Willow
turned their attention to the brunette standing behind Buffy as well, and
Willow paled upon seeing her.</p>

<p>"This is interesting," Oz said nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Guys, I want you to meet someone," Buffy started.</p>

<p>"I think we've already met her, and last time I checked it wasn't a very
enjoyable experience," Willow said softly, squeezing Oz's hand a little
tighter.</p>

<p>"Listen for a minute, this isn't Faith. Her name is Missy, and she's my new
roommate."</p>

<p>Everyone stared intently at Missy, who was just smiling weakly at them
still wondering just how this town got to be so damn weird. "Okay, and just
what did you hit your head on while I was gone Buffy? Hello, psycho girl is
standing behind you and your telling me her name is Missy?" Xander asked.
Willow kept staring at Missy, afraid she would try to attack at any moment
while Oz just sat by quietly waiting for his chance to speak up. He would
have mentioned that Missy had a different smell than Faith, but she wasn't
sure how the new girl would react for finding out about the other half of
him.</p>

<p>Missy sighed and decided on the quickest way to end this so she reached for
her wallet. "Look, it says Missy Pantone, not Faith whatever," she said as
she pointed to her driver's license.</p>

<p>"People can have those made for them," Willow said still not believing that
this wasn't actually Faith.</p>

<p>"Well look at her clothes," Buffy said as she received another glare from
Missy. "We all know Faith wouldn't ever show her face in public with
something like this on."</p>

<p>"Normally no, but after you put her in a coma she'd probably do anything to
get back at us," Xander stated.</p>

<p>"She smells different than Faith. It's not her," Oz said finally as he
noticed how frustrated Missy was looking.</p>

<p>"Wait, back up a second," Missy said as she turned to Buffy. "You’re the
one who put Faith in a coma?" Missy looked at Buffy, and suddenly everything
she thought she started figure out about the girl made no sense again. "And
what the hell is this about you sniffing me?"</p>

<p>"He's part werewolf," Willow stated, unsure of why she was actually talking
to what she believed was Faith.</p>

<p>Missy raised an eyebrow in question after Willow spoke. "Look, you all are
just way too wacky." She reached for the cross Buffy gave her and took the
necklace off her neck. "I tried humoring you Buffy, but this is just
unbelievable. From what you told me earlier, I'm sure you had your reasons
for putting Faith into a coma, but this werewolf stuff is just kind of nuts.
I'm outta here."</p>

<p>The Scooby gang watched in silence as Missy walked out of the Bronze.
"Listen guys, it's not Faith. You have to trust me here. Even Oz said it
wasn't her."</p>

<p>"How do you know for sure Buff? Oz could be wrong," Xander said. "No
offense or anything man," he added as he looked at Oz.</p>

<p>"None taken," Oz replied, sounding like he could care less about the whole
thing.</p>

<p>"I just know. It's kind of a slayer thing," Buffy told them. She winced
when she remembered the last time she spoke those words to her two best
friends. "I gotta go, I'll see you all later."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Where do you think? Missy's out there and some vamp's going to think it's
Faith and kill her! I can't let that happen."</p>

<p>"You're that sure that it's not Faith?" Willow questioned as she finally
started to believe what Buffy was telling her. Buffy nodded and Willow
noticed the sadness and urgency in Buffy's eyes. It was almost as if even
though Missy wasn't Faith, Buffy wanted to save her like she couldn't save
Faith. Since Missy looked just like Faith if Buffy was able to help her
maybe it would help Buffy feel a little less guilty about not being able to
save the other slayer in the past. "Good luck finding her," Willow said
softly.</p>

<p>The blonde gave her a weak smile before sprinting out of the Bronze. She
started running in the direction of the campus, hoping that it was the way
Missy had gone after leaving the group behind. All she could do was hope
that she found Missy before anything happened to her.</p>

<hr>

<p>'Just great,' Missy thought to herself. 'This is your first day in town and
you've gotten yourself a room with a wacko who tried to kill the girl she
doesn't even realize she's in love with. Now if only I knew what was up with
this werewolf crap they're talking about. They are some nutty people.'</p>

<p>Missy stopped as she reached the next block and realized she had forgotten
her way back to campus. She saw two guys walking down the street and
approached them so she could ask which way the campus was. "Well look what
we have here, a lost slayer."</p>

<p>"Slayer?" Missy asked the guy, who looked like he was probably a few years
older than her.</p>

<p>"And all this time we thought you were living it up as a vegetable,"
another male said, ignoring her obvious question. "Guess that your dear
friend Buffy didn't stick that knife in far enough."</p>

<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Missy asked getting very freaked out
by this new town she had come too. She started to wish she had chose to go
to the same college as Les. Missy tried to walk away from the two, but one
of the men grabbed her arm and as she turned around she noticed that his
face changed.</p>

<p>"I've always wanted to taste the slayer's blood." The vampire pushed Missy
onto the ground and brushed her hair away from her neck. When Missy saw the
vampire's sharp fangs she realized why Buffy had insisted on her wearing the
cross necklace. She began to berate herself silently as she lay helpless
underneath the strong grasp of the vampire. She didn't know why, but she had
the feeling that Buffy would be the only one who was able to help her now.</p>
