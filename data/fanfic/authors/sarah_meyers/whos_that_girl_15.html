<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 14 -->

<p>"I know the reason you brought me here," Tara said quietly as her and
Cordelia walked into the mansion. The ex cheerleaders eyes went wide as she
looked at Tara.</p>

<p>"How do you know? I haven't told you anything yet. Come to think of it, just
why did you come with me and not even ask an explanation?"</p>

<p>"B-because I could tell you needed my h-help. You got confused in Sunnydale,
and you t-think I can help you solve that confusion right?"</p>

<p>"But how do you know what I'm confused about?" Cordelia questioned. She knew
Tara was a more powerful wicca than Willow had told her about, but there's
no way the blonde could be a mind reader.</p>

<p>A small smile formed on Tara's lips that almost freaked Cordelia out. "I
just know that you're confused about two people. One you're in love with,
and one you could possibly be in love with. You want me to give you
answers," Tara replied.</p>

<p>"That's just really weird. How come you're not all shy when you go into
witch mode?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Who's a witch?" another voice asked and Cordelia practically jumped
backwards in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why do you always do that?" she asked in agitated tones. "Can't you just be
normal for a change?"</p>

<p>"I'm a vampire Cordelia. I'm not normal," Angel replied with a small smile.
"And do what?" he replied to her first question.</p>

<p>"You know what I'm talking about," Cordelia chided him. "That creepy popping
up out of nowhere thing all the time."</p>

<p>"You've only known me for how many years now?" he asked. "Shouldn't you be
used to it by now?"</p>

<p>Tara watched the exchange between the two friends and smiled softly to
herself. She knew she hadn't really been needed in LA for anything
important, and she even had an idea that Cordelia never really saw anything
that night at the Bronze. Cordelia had only become confused and Tara knew
that she had just needed someone impartial to help her figure things out. To
talk to about how she was feeling, towards Angel and Missy. It just hadn't
clicked completely in the blonde's mind until they had actually arrived in
LA since she had been so wrapped up with her thoughts on Willow.</p>

<p>Someone new to the group like Tara wouldn't hold their past against them,
and she wouldn't be able to yell at Cordelia for possibly leading Missy on.
Because Tara was new to the group, she would be able to realize that what
Cordelia felt for Missy was real, and did mean a lot to her. But when it
came down to it, any fool could see that she was helplessly in love with the
man standing in front of her.</p>

<p>But now Cordelia was scared. If she had been the same girl she was in high
school it wouldn't have bothered her, but she knew that if Tara could help
her to get with Angel, it meant she'd have to hurt Missy. And that was
almost as bad as sticking a knife in her own heart.</p>

<p>Cordelia finally let out a soft sigh of exasperation and tugged on Tara's
hand, pulling her up the stairs in the mansion leaving Angel behind. She
gave him one last look before he disappeared from her sight and smiled
sadly. Yes, it would hurt her if she hurt Missy, but it would kill her if
she never got a chance with Angel. Besides, Missy deserved someone who
actually lived closer to her and could be more devoted to her. 'Someone like
Willow,' Cordelia thought with a small smile just before her brain went into
overdrive, trying to think of ways Tara could help to get her with Angel.</p>

<hr>

<p>After a while, Torrance had realized that due to what happened to Willow,
she wouldn't be able to spend any time with Missy. She decided to just go
home after making Missy promise that the two would have a long talk after
all this was over. Missy felt horrible for not being able to spend time with
Torrance, but after what just happened to Willow she felt that she should be
more worried about her new friend.</p>

<p>Now the two were sitting in Missy's dorm room and Missy was nervously
waiting for Buffy and Faith to arrive. Missy looked over at Willow, who was
sobbing softly on Buffy's bed and she immediately rushed to Willow's side
and pulled the girl into her arms, trying to fight off her anger at Oz.
Willow curled into her arms and Missy stroked her hair soothingly and smiled
softly to herself remembering Torrance asking her just when she became such
a 'softy' as she had put it. She shook her head ruefully and pushed the
thought back for pondering at another time.</p>

<p>"Hey, it's gonna be okay Willow," Missy said softly as she took the red
head's hand into her own.</p>

<p>Willow shook her head forcefully in an adamant no, and pulled herself away
from Missy so she could look at the brunette. "He's punishing me," she said
sadly.</p>

<p>"For what?" Missy asked. "For being the sweetest girl to ever walk the
earth?"</p>

<p>If Willow weren't so upset about the whole Oz thing, she would've smiled at
Missy's words. "In high school Xander and I kinda, cheated with each other.
He was with Cordy then and Oz and I were together and we cheated because
we're bad evil cheaters and Oz is trying to get back at me for being bad and
evil," Willow said as she started sobbing again.</p>

<p>Missy sighed inwardly and pulled Willow back into her arms. "You're not evil
Willow. If anything, all you are is sweet, fun and loveable okay?" Missy
asked as she kissed the top of Willow's forehead. Missy was about to
continue talking but Buffy and Faith came into the room with wide grins on
their faces, which quickly disappeared when they saw the two girls.</p>

<p>Buffy was immediately at her best friends side upon seeing her sad eyes,
hugging her fiercely while Faith looked at Missy confused. "What happened
Will?" Buffy asked softly as she broke the hug with her best friend and
wiped the tears from her face.</p>

<p>"Oz," Willow sniffled. "He k-kissed that girl and I saw him," she told Buffy
as she tried to hold back the new tears that were forming in her eyes.</p>

<p>"He what?" Faith almost yelled, her hands already forming fists and she
started pacing around the room. "He kissed another girl Red?" Willow only
answered with a nod and Faith's anger rose even more. Buffy pulled Willow
closer to her and started whispering reassurances at her while Missy rose
from the blonde's bed to calm Faith down.</p>

<p>When Missy got closer to Faith and looked into her eyes it reminded her of
looking into a hurricane or something, and all you can do it just wait for
the storm because you know there's going to be trouble. "Faith, you need to
calm down," Missy said softly even though she retained a certain edge to her
voice.</p>

<p>"Calm down? Red's my friend now and look what he's done to her. Full moon or
not, I'm going to find his sorry little wolf ass and kick it back to," Faith
paused for a brief second and turned back to Missy. "To wherever his sorry
little wolf ass came from. No one fucks with the people I care about now."</p>

<p>"I feel the same damn way okay? But Willow still loves him, and that would
only hurt her further Faith. It's not like they haven't gotten through
something like this before. I'm sure they can again. And you have to calm
down before I have to kick your ass," Missy said with a smile. Faith laughed
at that and her anger seemed to have dissipated some.</p>

<p>"Can you take care of her?" Faith asked abruptly as she looked at Willow who
was crying once again in Buffy's arms.</p>

<p>"Of course," Missy replied, not even having to think about the answer as she
raised an eyebrow at Faith curiously. "Why?"</p>

<p>"You never said I couldn't scare the shit out of him, assuming I find him
before he goes all hairy on us. And you know that B won't let me go by
myself so I need to be sure you can take care of Red."</p>

<p>Missy's smile grew as she looked at Faith and went to pat her look alike on
the shoulder. "Why, I think I got that softy side of me from you. 'Cuz I
think you're just about the biggest softy I've ever seen."</p>

<p>Faith looked appalled at the notion of being a softy and scoffed at Missy.
"You try saying that again and you'll see just how soft my fist is," Faith
said teasingly.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Missy mumbled. "Now go on and get out of here," she whispered.</p>

<p>Faith's grin grew at that as she looked at Missy. "Why, I'd almost think you
wanted some privacy with Red. Over Queen C already?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not over Cordy, but realistically we both know it won't work out
anyways so it's not like I’m holding my breath. She's the only one I want to
be my girl though. But that has nothing to do with this. I never said I
disagreed with your idea about scaring the shit outta Oz for what he did."</p>

<p>Faith just put on her shit-eating grin and walked over to Buffy and Willow.
"Where's he at Red?" Willow just looked up at her blankly as if she didn't
understand the question. "Fuck it, I'll find him." Faith said and she bent
down to give Buffy a quick kiss before turning around to walk out the door.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed and stood up from the bed. She gave Willow's hand a soft
squeeze before walking to the door. "Guess that's my que to make sure she
doesn't go doing anything irrational isn't it?" Buffy asked with a small
smile. Both girls smiled at her in return and she slipped out of her dorm to
find her girlfriend.</p>

<p>Missy sat back down next to Willow, who seemed to finally be calming down.
Taking Willow's hand into her own, she went about trying to think of ways to
get the red head's mind off of her lousy boyfriend.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Well?" Cordelia asked in slightly agitated tones.</p>

<p>"Well what?" Tara replied as she gave Cordy a confused look. Cordelia just
sighed loudly and Tara shook her head in understanding. "I can't just put a
spell on him and b-bam instant love. You just have to tell him how you
f-feel about him," Tara said softly.</p>

<p>Cordelia sat down at her desk and pulled out a nail file. "It's not like I
can just say 'Hey Angel, I'm in love with you but you're just a big oaf who
never notices these things' to him. You're supposed to be here to help me
get him. Not make me get him on my own."</p>

<p>"You have to do this on you're own. Just tell him how you feel, and it'll be
okay," Tara reassured her.</p>

<p>"But I can't tell him I love him," Cordelia whined.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Angel asked as he walked up to the two girls.  He had figured she
had some new boyfriend and he didn't see why she suddenly became shy about
her feelings.</p>

<p>"You have to stop doing that!" Cordelia yelled at Angel as she stood up and
walked out of the room. His eyes went wide as he watched Cordelia walk out.
Angel turned to Tara who just offered him a weak smile.</p>

<p>"Please tell me you know what that was about?"</p>

<p>Tara thought about the question for a second before locking eyes with Angel.
"She was talking about you," she told him softly, deciding that she might as
well help Cordelia out. After all, the sooner the two got together, the
sooner she could go back to Sunnydale.</p>

<p>"What was she saying about me?" Angel asked curiously.</p>

<p>Tara let out a small laugh and finally realized why Cordelia had needed her
help. He was as dense as a rock. "She l-loves you," she informed him.</p>

<p>Finally a look of understanding spread across Angel's face and he smiled at
Tara. "She does?" Tara only nodded in response, and Angel's smile grew.
After another second he quietly excused himself from the room and went to
find Cordelia.</p>

<p>It didn't take him very long to find her, and when he did she tried her best
to ignore him. Finally he decided to just get to the point knowing that it
was the only way she would listen to him. "So what's this I hear about you
loving me?" he asked her softly as he turned her around to face him.</p>

<p>"She told you?" Cordelia asked in surprise. She wasn't sure if she should be
thankful or angry with Tara. Most likely she should be thankful though since
it was the whole reason she had brought the wiccan to LA. Angel brushed a
stray lock of hair behind her ear, and if he had actually had a heartbeat he
was certain it would have been racing at this point. "It's true," Cordelia
whispered softly.</p>

<p>"I think I love you too," Angel replied as he bent down to kiss Cordelia
softly. It was a quick, experimental kiss and when the two broke apart
Codelia smiled at him.</p>

<p>"You think?" she asked as she playfully swatted his arm. She leaned up to
give him another kiss, this time making sure to make it last a little
longer. This time when they broke apart Cordelia turned to walk away from
Angel, but stopped just before she was out of his sight. "What do you think
now?" she asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"I love you," he replied with a smile of his own.</p>

<p>"Good," she stated. "But I've gotta call a friend back in Sunnydale now."
Cordelia told him just before she turned around the corner, out of Angel's
sight. The souled vampire just shook his head, wondering if he'd ever figure
women out.</p>

<hr>

<p>Back in Sunnydale, Buffy finally found Faith roaming the streets of
Sunnydale looking for Oz. She was almost tempted to let her girlfriend go
after Oz, and do as she wanted to him but since it was dark now, it was just
to dangerous. After all, they were vampire slayers, not wolf slayers. Though
the blonde had to admit, they've probably fought worse before.</p>

<p>"Faith," Buffy said softly, getting her girlfriends attention.</p>

<p>"Don't try to stop me B. The guy deserves what I'm going to do to him and
more. You know it as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do know it Faith," Buffy said as she took her girlfriend's hand into
her own. "Will's my best friend and I hate anyone that hurts her. But we
have to let her deal with this. All we can do is make the situation worse."</p>

<p>"But the jerk kissed someone else," Faith practically yelled.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. And it's up to Willow to decide what happens to him, not us,"
Buffy said softly. Buffy wrapped her arms around Faith's neck and pulled her
girlfriend down for a soft kiss. "Come on Faith, let's just go back to the
room?" Buffy questioned with pleading tones in her voice.</p>

<p>Faith relented, pushing her anger aside and kissed Buffy once again. "Only
because I love you," she replied with a smile. Wrapping her arm around
Buffy's waist she let her love lead her back to campus.</p>

<p>Once they got back to the dorm room the first thing they saw was Willow and
Missy cuddled together on the brunette's bed, sleeping soundly. Buffy and
Faith smiled at each other and Buffy went to turn off the small lamp that
was right beside Missy's bed so they wouldn't have the light shining right
in their faces. When she got closer to them, the blonde noticed that Willow
wasn't the only one with tear streaks on her cheeks and she gave Faith a
questioning look.</p>

<p>Faith shrugged, figuring that whatever Willow told her must've just upset
Missy too or something. At least until Buffy checked the messages on the
answering machine, making sure to play them back quietly. That's when they
both heard the message from Cordy, not only telling them that she'd bring
Tara back soon, but that she was now with Angel, that quickly after leaving
Missy behind.</p>

<p>Both slayers wanted to be angry with Cordelia for that, but looking at their
two friends holding each other in the bed next to them, they couldn't help
but think about how cute they looked together. "What do you think will
become of those two?" Buffy asked softly as she felt herself being pulled
down into her bed by Faith.</p>

<p>"I dunno," Faith replied as she kissed Buffy's neck. "But hey, we found our
way to each other. Maybe one day they might too."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy sighed wistfully as she got more comfortable in Faith's arms.
"Besides, nothing brings people better together than pain. I think we've
learned that one for ourselves," Buffy said as she kissed Faith.</p>

<p>"So what now B?"</p>

<p>Buffy's smile grew as she moved out of her girlfriend's embrace. "I take a
shower of course. It's been a long day."</p>

<p>Faith's smile matched her girlfriends as she pulled Buffy back to her. "Can
I come?" she purred into Buffy's ear quietly.</p>

<p>Buffy kissed Faith passionately, and move her mouth closer to Faith's ear
and nibbled on her earlobe softly. "Only if I'm the one making you come,"
she teased right before standing up to gather her shower supplies.</p>

<p>Faith let out a small laugh and smiled to herself. Even though her friend's
lives were an utter mess, for once she was glad she wasn't the one with the
problems. For once, she got to help friends, instead of hurt them. As she
followed Buffy into the shower she knew, it was all because the blonde
standing in front of her loved her that she was doing so well. And now, she
had every intention on thanking the blonde slayer in the best way she knew
how.</p>
