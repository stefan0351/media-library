<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 1 -->

<p>"I know you'll probably think I'm really weird when I finish telling you
about this, at least if you don't already think I am, but please be patient
with me here okay?" Buffy asked as she moved to sit on the other bed in the
small dorm room.</p>

<p>"Okay," Missy replied as she looked at Buffy curiously. She was starting to
wish Les had walked her to her room so when she told him about her wacky
roomie he would believe her.</p>

<p>"Since we're going to be sharing a room for the next year, there are a few
things I need to explain to you. Normally I don't just go telling people
about this stuff but everyone in Sunnydale pretty much already knows anyways
even though they like to pretend they don't. I'm just too tired of trying to
hide it from people and since you'll come to just think I'm really weird
anyways I might as well tell you everything since I have to explain about
Faith."</p>

<p>Missy nodded her head at Buffy and realized how much she missed her nice,
normal friends back at RCH. 'Even Courtney and Whitney who I could hardly
stand when they weren't cheering seem like more fun to be around than this
Buffy girl,' she thought As soon as she heard Buffy talking again she
snapped out of her thoughts and listened to her.</p>

<p>"You know what? You're not going to believe what I say anyways so how about
I just give you the really short version and show you tonight?" Buffy asked,
and sighed when she saw the way Missy was looking at her.</p>

<p>"Just tell me who this Faith person is so I can know why you looked like
you were ready to kill me," Missy said softly, trying to hide the annoyance
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Only if you agree to go out with me and my friends tonight so I can
explain the rest later," Buffy stated.</p>

<p>"Sure, whatever. Just tell me already," Missy replied already getting
frustrated with this conversation and her new roommate.</p>

<p>Buffy gave her a small smile and went on to tell her about Faith, leaving
all vampire and demon parts of the story out. "She was basically a girl I
knew in high school last year. I thought we were becoming pretty good
friends but then she decided she wanted to make my life hell and she ended
up in a coma right before I graduated," Buffy said quietly as she allowed
herself to think about Faith for the first time in a very long time. "You
look just like her and when I woke up and saw you I thought it was her. I'm
really sorry about that Missy."</p>

<p>"It's okay I guess. I don't see how I can look so much like her though. I
mean it's not like we're twins or anything." Missy got up from the bed and
walked over to where her bags were laying on the floor. "So what side of the
room do you want?" Missy asked, hoping to leave that weird conversation
behind.</p>

<p>"I was hoping I could have the left," Buffy said as she rumaged through the
small duffel bag she had with her. She still had all of her things at her
mother's house and only brought enough things to last her the night and a
few small photo's of her friends and other knick nacks so she could at least
make the room start to feel like home.</p>

<p>Making sure to leave Mr. Pointy in the bag she dumped it's contents out
onto her bed and sat down next to the items to sort them out. As she started
placing the pictures of her and her friends on the small night stand beside
her bed she came across the small framed picture of Faith that she had
brought with her. After graduation she went back to the appartment and
stumbled upon it, and decided to keep it.</p>

<p>While she knew Faith had hurt her very much, she also knew it was Faith
that saved them at graduation in the dream the two shared so it was hard to
hold a grudge on her. She was still angry and hurt by it all but she also
still felt guilty for being the one to put Faith in a coma, and missed the
friend that she once had in Faith. "Hey Missy," Buffy called out as she
turned to look at her roommate who was unpacking. Missy stopped and turned
her attention to Buffy and noticed the girl was holding something in her
hands.</p>

<p>Buffy handed the picture to Missy and smiled softly when Missy went wide
eyed. "That's Faith," Buffy stated. "Now you can see why I thought you were
her right? Minus the dark make up and the leather, you two are practically
carbon copies of each other."</p>

<p>Missy just nodded as she continued to look at the picture for another
minute wondering how they could look so alike and not even be related.  She
finally gave the picture back to Buffy who neatly placed it on the night
stand next to her other pictures. "So do I really have to go out with you
and your friends tonight? Not to sound like a major bitch but it's been a
long day for me and I really don't feel like it," Missy said.</p>

<p>"It would be kinda better for you if you came tonight. Now that you know
how much you look like Faith, it would be really bad if my friends saw you
thinking you were her. I don't think you'd be able to convince them as
easily as me that your not her and they'll have pretty much the same
reaction to you that I did."</p>

<p>"Great, so your taking me out to get beat up on my first night in this
town. What a wacky place," Missy mumbled quietly not knowing that since
Buffy was a slayer she could hear what was just said. "So how come you
believed me so easily when I said I wasn't her?"</p>

<p>Buffy watched Missy for a few seconds as she unpacked trying to come up
with the answer to her question, wondering how much she should really tell
her new roommate. "For one, Faith would never be caught dead in those
clothes," Buffy said finally, not failing to notice the glare Missy shot at
her. "Not that there's anything wrong with your clothes. It's just that
Faith has this weird thing for leather. Besides, she's still in a coma and I
don't see how if she woke up she could suddenly be in my dorm room." Buffy
hoped that would be enough to satisfy the girl since she really didn't want
to list all the reasons she knew it wasn't Faith.</p>

<p>The most predominant of those reasons being that Buffy could always feel
when Faith was around because of their slayer connection. It was like the
same feeling she got around vampires, only more warm and fuzzy. Then there
were the less important ones like the fact that if it were Faith, she could
have easily gotten Buffy off of her. Not to mention that Buffy could tell
the difference in their eyes. Even though they were the same color, Faith
always looked at Buffy like she could see right into her very soul and Missy
hadn't looked at her like that.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed softly and Missy sat down on her new bed and looked at her.
"You miss Faith don't you?" she asked noticing the pained expression on
Buffy's face.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Buffy answered with a soft tone. "She really messed up my
life in so many ways. She hurt so many people I care about but before all
that we were starting to get really close. She was like a sister to me
almost, and it's hard to stay mad at her even though I feel like I should."</p>

<p>Missy watched Buffy's face and saw the pain and hurt in her eyes and knew
there was a lot more to this girl than met the eye. Knowing that the subject
of Faith was obviously hard on her new roomie Missy changed the subject.
"I'm going to give my idiot brother a call and let him know I finally got
here and then we can go out like you wanted," Missy said lightly.</p>

<p>"Okay," Buffy replied as she pushed away her thoughts for the moment. She
knew tonight would be a very long night and she wanted to enjoy the quiet
while she could. "I'm going to go for a walk to clear my head a little so
you can have some privacy on the phone. I'll be back in a little bit." Buffy
moved off her bed and gave Missy a smile as she walked out of the room.</p>

<p>At first she thought about going to Willow's dorm room and telling her
about Missy so she would be prepared for it but then she decided it would be
easier to tell everyone at once so she wouldn't have to explain things a
million times. As she walked past Willow's room she wondered just how she
would go about telling the gang that just because Missy looked like Faith,
it wasn't really Faith. Sure the coma thing would be able to sort the issue
out pretty quick had Faith not been a slayer, and also if any of them had
actually bothered to keep tabs on the rogue slayer. Truth was, no one really
stopped to think about Faith after graduation which was almost sad. Suddenly
Buffy realized just how much she did miss her friend Faith, and how much she
hoped that the brunette would wake up so they could make amends.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey perv, it's me," Missy said into the telephone. "I guess you and Torr
are out somewhere but I just wanted to let you know I got to school and
everything. Have a good trip to Kentucky tommorow and tell Torr I said hi
and that I hope she manages to find a real boyfriend someday," Missy said
jokingly to her brothers answering machine. "I would tell you to give me a
call back but I'm going out with my new roommate tonight. At first I thought
she was about as annoying and stupid as those football jocks from school
were but she's turning out to be quite a mystery and I'm looking forward to
figuring it out. Talk to you later," Missy said just before hanging up the
phone.</p>

<p>Missy began to look through her clothes so she could pick out what to wear
later. At the same time she was wondering why she was suddenly so curious
about her new roommates past, and what she was all about. The only thing she
knew for sure was that when they talked about Faith, Buffy had the same
sadness that she had seen when Cliff found out that Torrance had a boyfriend
after regionals. She knew it could only mean one thing, and even though she
didn't know Buffy at all yet, she wanted more than anything to find a way to
make that sadness go away even if she was the only one who knew the real
reason it was there.</p>
