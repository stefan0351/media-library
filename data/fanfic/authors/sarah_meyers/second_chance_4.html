<!-- Second Chance \ Part 2 -->

<p>I lay in my bed now, finding sleep impossible, not that it's
anything new. I've never had an easy time sleeping in this place and
not just because of all the noise the other inmates make. I do think
they really like to piss me off, but I can't say I haven't enjoyed
pissing them off at times. But after my last fight I learned to keep
to myself. It's hell knowing that I could take every single person in
this place, but I have to let them beat on me if I want to get out of
here. </p>

<p>Normally when I try to sleep I just have nightmares about the
things I've done. Mostly the things I did to B. I suppose I deserve
the nightmares, and the pain that comes from them but it would be
nice to just get one night of peaceful sleep. The reason I can't
sleep tonight is still her, as it always has been, but not because of
my nightmares. But B has my journal and now she'll read all about how
fucked up I am. What was I thinking when I gave that to her?</p>

<p>I just wanted her to know how much I love her. She'll know
I'm sorry for what I did, but what's she going to think when she
reads I did everything out of love? I'm sure she'll just be ecstatic
to know I tried to kill her boyfriend and torture her friends because
I loved her. Some great way of showing your love huh? But how could
she not get it in the first place? </p>

<p>I know I need to get these thoughts out of my head. I just
gotta remember the hug. Great, now I've got that goofy smile on my
face again all because B hugged me. Some bad ass I am. Turn into a
giggling five year old all because of some stupid hug. </p>

<p>Maybe if I just close my eyes for long enough I'll fall
asleep. I've only got a few days left in here and then the real test
begins. Yes, sleep is good.</p>

<p>"Faith?" </p>

<p>All the sudden my eyes shoot open but something's
different. "B...?" I look around me but I'm not in prison anymore.
Oh, I get it, slayer dreams. Duh. Finally I see her and she's sitting
on this couch in what I'm guessing to be her hotel room. "You know we
haven't shared a dream in a long time B. Another end of the world
crisis?" I ask with a smile. I know this is one of our slayer dreams
because it's too real to be another of my nightmares. Being a slayer
definitely has its perks.</p>

<p>"No, not this time Faith. I'm not exactly sure why we're
here. I guess we were both thinking about each other before we fell
asleep." She starts walking towards me and my body tenses. She
doesn't look angry but I've learned to always expect the worst. Then
you'll never be disappointed. </p>

<p>"I see you've been doing some reading," I say to her as I
point to my open journal on the table. "Now you know how fucked up I
am, if you didn't figure it out before." I spot the radio that's on a
small table beside her bed and I walk over to it and flick it
on. "I've been dying to hear some damn music you know? I hate how
it's so quiet in there sometimes."</p>

<p>I'm not looking at her but I know she's walking up behind me
and I just start singing. "Loaded, I've loaded up this gun. There's a
killer in me." </p>

<p>"Hoping, hope that you're the one. But you always run away
when I come around." She finishes the singing the song and puts her
hand softly on my back. I shut up wondering what the hell this dream
is supposed to mean. "I'll be here when you get out Faith. Come home
to Sunnydale with me?"</p>

<p>"Why? We hate each other B. Haven't I caused you enough pain
already?" Her small arms wrap around my waist as if in answer to my
question.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say you meant everything in that journal?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I did." I want to turn around and return her embrace
but I'm too scared. Maybe this isn't a slayer dream after all.
There's no way B would want me to come with her.</p>

<p>"Then don't you love me? If you want to make it up to me,
come home with me and make things right. You don't hate me Faith, and
I don't hate you. As much as I wish I could at times, I've never been
able to. You got lost somewhere along the way, we both did and you
know as well as I do we need each other."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurt you anymore B. I never wanted to. I'm
sorry." She walks in front of me and I notice the unshed tears in her
eyes. I laugh quietly at the thought of her crying over me, the one
person who's caused her more pain than anyone else. She lifts her
hand and wipes away the few stray tears that I've let slip past my
eyes and for the first time I let myself embrace her. "I know you
haven't forgiven me yet but I want to make it up to you. I'll do
anything you want, and I..." I stop and take a deep breath. She's
looking in my eyes now, and hers are almost pleading me to say it.
The words I've never spoken to anyone in my life. "I love you."</p>

<p>"I love you too Faith. That's why I came to see you earlier
and why I couldn't keep up that pissy attitude when you came close to
me. I never realized it, until that moment in prison when you were so
close to me. Then it all made sense. There's still a lot that we'll
have to work out when you get out and I want to discuss some of the
things in this journal. But I'll be waiting for you. I always have
been."

	"No more hate and fighting?" I question. I know it's silly to
ask her since I've been the one to start the fighting most of the
times but I just need to be sure that she really wants to go through
this. We've hurt each other so much I'm not sure how to make all of
it go away but maybe this love stuff will work.</p>

<p>The things in the room around us start to fade and I know it
means one of us is waking up. I swear if it's me I'm going to beat
the shit out of myself for ruining my moment with B. "No more hate
Faith," she whispers as she gives me a soft kiss on the cheek. "See
you in a few days," she says as everything fades away.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>My eyes open slowly and I look around to find I'm back in my
cell. I want to curse at myself like I usually do for ruining things
but something stops me. I stand to look out at the night sky through
the small window in my cell. The sun is just beginning to rise and I
feel like with the new day I'm being given a chance to start my life
again. To start the right way with B at my side.</p>

<p>I can still feel her in my embrace, and her soft lips on my
cheek. Even though I'll always have to live with the regret of the
things I've done, it's nice to know that at least I can make some
things right and that B's willing to help me. What I've done to
deserve any of it, I'm still not sure of but one thing I have learned
in my life is to never question fate. And that's exactly what brought
B and I together. We were made for each other and it's not too late
for me to show her just how much I love her.</p>
