<p>When Buffy walked over to her group of friends the first thing she noticed
was the eerie quiet as everyone stared at Faith and Missy. The blonde took
the opportunity to sit down at the table while hoping that she'd magically
be sucked into the floor or better yet, spontaneously combust. 'Where's a
vampire when you need one?' Buffy thought to herself.</p>

<p>Since no one was speaking Faith just smiled and sat on Buffy's lap. "You
mind? There's no other chairs around," she informed her with her usual
carefree attitude.</p>

<p>"Please tell me that's your twin and not who I think it is," Willow said to
Missy as calmly as she could in her situation.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disappoint Red, but it's me," Faith said with a smile that caused
the red head to shudder.</p>

<p>Too shocked to do anything else, the whole group just stared at Buffy
waiting to see her reaction to this. Luckily for her the group was too busy
studying her facial expressions to notice her arms that were now
protectively wrapped around Faith's waist. "Umm guys, Faith's back," she
said softly.</p>

<p>"So we noticed Buff, but my question to you is why aren't you kicking her
skanky ass out of Sunnydale?" Xander asked, the seriousness of his question
evident in his voice.</p>

<p>"Because we kinda made up?" Buffy offered as she hid behind Faith not
noticing that the smirk never left Faith's face. As much as she shouldn't be
since Buffy's friends were obviously unhappy with her, the brunette was
enjoying this.</p>

<p>Missy quickly decided that this was between the gang, and stood up to make
her exit but Willow glared at her. "Sit," the red head commanded and Missy
sat back down, wondering why she was even listening to Willow. "How long?"
she questioned harshly.</p>

<p>"How long what?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Have you been chummy with our worst enemy," Xander answered for his
lifelong friend.</p>

<p>"It all just happened last night. I wasn't trying to keep this from you all
or anything," Buffy said. "It all just happened kinda fast. I'm still trying
to get used to it, but Faith's good now," Buffy told them. Faith could feel
Buffy's uneasiness and placed her hand on top of the blonde slayers in
comfort. She wanted to plead her case with the scoobies but she already knew
they wouldn't even listen to her so she held her tongue.</p>

<p>Willow's expression changed as if something just clicked in her mind. "That
was you last night at the Espresso Pump wasn't it?" Willow asked as she
looked at Faith and the brunette only nodded. "I can't believe you Buffy.
You lied to me, again!" Willow said as calmly as she could, not wanting to
make a scene in front of the entire dining hall. "And you," she stopped and
turned her attention to Missy. "You knew about this too?" Missy nodded her
confirmation and Willow shook her head sadly. "Just when I thought we could
actually be friends."</p>

<p>The red head stood up from her chair, trying her best to keep calm. "This is
bullshit Buffy. I don't know what she's done to fool you, but she'll only
hurt you, and us again if she gets the chance. You might be okay with
risking our lives again, but I'm not so I won't stick around for it," she
paused to look at Faith. "And don't you ever let me see you again or you
will regret it. I'm not the same girl I was in high school, and you don't
scare me anymore. Understood?"</p>

<p>Faith's eyes widened in surprise at the girls statement and she nodded her
head. It was clear to her that Willow was different than she was in high
school. Even though she was still the babbling, cute hacker she remembered
her self confidence seemed to have grown a lot. Willow gave Faith one last
disgusted look before making her way out of the dining hall.</p>

<p>Oz stood up and nodded at Buffy before going to find his girlfriend. He was
grateful that he wasn't the one who had to break the news to Willow, and he
knew that given time Willow would be able to forgive Buffy for this. He
stopped for a few seconds and turned around to wait for Xander, whom he knew
would be making his exit as well. "Nice one Buff," Xander said coldly as he
caught up with Oz and the two left the dining hall.</p>

<p>"That was-"</p>

<p>"Entertaining?" Faith supplied for Buffy as she made her way out of the
blonde's lap.</p>

<p>"To say the least," Missy answered. "I'm outta here."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said absently as she met her roommate's gaze. "I'm sorry that
Willow's mad at you because of me. I don't mean to make your college life
such hell."</p>

<p>"Don't sweat it Buffy. She'll get over it, and it's not your fault." Missy
smiled at them weakly before making her exit. She didn't doubt that Willow
would forgive Buffy, and she hoped that the red head would be able to
forgive her for whatever it was that she did wrong.  All she could do was
hope that her earlier words about getting over her grudge on Faith were
still roaming around Willow's head somewhere.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I screwed things up for you again B," Faith said as she watched
Buffy softly beat her head against the table.</p>

<p>"It's not your fault Faith. It was wrong of me to want to keep you a secret
from them for longer anyways. It had to happen, and it's best it's already
over with." Buffy continued to beat her head into the table until she felt
Faith's hand on her forehead stopping her.</p>

<p>"So who was that hottie I saw you talking to in line?" Faith asked, hoping
that the change of subject might help lighten the mood a little. Buffy
groaned in response.</p>

<p>"I think I just realized I don't need to start a relationship with anyone
new right now," Buffy replied as she looked sadly at Faith.</p>

<p>"What about with someone old then?" Faith asked softly.</p>

<p>"Faith?" Buffy questioned, trying to figure out if the brunette were serious
or not.</p>

<p>"Sorry B," Faith said as she shook her head. "You know me, speak without
thinking first. But he's a looker, you should go after him. Maybe a little
uhhhh would make you feel better," Faith laughed, hoping that Buffy would
think she was only joking about her previous comment. Actually, she was
trying to convince herself that she was only joking about it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Willow sat out in Oz's van clenching and unclenching her fists in
frustration and anger. "How could… It's Faith! Is she stupid or something?"
Willow wondered aloud. "And Missy. Just when I thought maybe she wasn't so
bad you know? Even if it was only for a night, they lied to me! I can't
believe Buffy lied to me again," Willow said sadly.</p>

<p>"So what are you more upset about here?" Oz asked as he took his
girlfriend's hand into his own. "Is it because Buffy didn't tell you last
night that it was Faith in the Espresso Pump, or that she forgave her?"</p>

<p>"It's everything. Faith is evil. Buffy's supposed to kill evil yet she seems
to make friends with it all the time. It'll just end in disaster."</p>

<p>"Can't say I disagree with you on that one," Oz stated. "Now why are you
angry with Missy?"</p>

<p>"Because when I went there last night, to their dorm and we kinda made
friends with each other. She probably doesn't even have a boyfriend. She
lied to me, to protect Faith and it's wrong and it hurts. Is there something
wrong with me?" Willow questioned as she turned to look at her boyfriend.
"Why does she always choose Faith over me, her best friend?"</p>

<p>Oz bent over from the drivers seat in his van and kissed her softly.
"There's nothing wrong with you. Buffy loves you, she just makes the wrong
decisions sometimes."</p>

<hr>

<p>A few hours later Faith was making her way back to Buffy's dorm room hoping
that Missy would be there so she could get in. Earlier the blonde had told
her she could crash there for a while since Faith wasn't exactly looking
forward to going back to the old apartment the mayor gave her. Neither of
the slayers were ready to see that place again after the fight they had
there.</p>

<p>Faith was relieved when Missy opened the door to let her in and she made her
way to Buffy's unmade bed and layed upon it. "Sorry about earlier," she said
softly as she looked at Missy. "You seemed happy last night, about being
friends with Red and I kinda screwed it up for you."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it," Missy replied. "She'll come around eventually."</p>

<p>"Is it okay with you if I crash here for a little while? I don't really have
anywhere else to go, or at least any place pleasant and B said I could stay
here and I wanted to make sure that it's cool with you too."</p>

<p>Missy smiled and told her that she didn't mind one bit and Faith got more
comfortable on Buffy's bed. "I see the way you look at B and I," Faith said
out of the blue as she rolled onto her side to look at Missy who was sitting
at her desk. "It's like you know something we don't."</p>

<p>"Maybe I do," Missy coaxed, hoping the conversation would go where she
wanted it to. Faith smiled sadly at her, realizing just why Missy always
looked at the two like she did.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving soon anyways, so don't get any ideas about playing matchmaker.
This is the way it has to be. I think I realized that a long time ago,"
Faith told her as she got up to leave. Missy just watched as her look alike
walked out of the room in stunned silence. She could only hope that Faith
was only joking about leaving.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy walked quietly through one of Sunnydale's many graveyards. It was
still sunny out so she knew that there wouldn't be any vampire disturbances
and it was the only place she could think of where she wouldn't be
disturbed. After everything that happened earlier, she needed some alone
time and she was thankful that when she asked Faith to be alone the brunette
had agreed without asking questions.</p>

<p>She knew her friend's reaction to Faith wouldn't be good, but now she had no
idea of how to get them to forgive her, or the younger slayer. She knew she
couldn't, and wouldn't apologize for making up with Faith even if it was
what her friends had wanted to hear. She knew she somehow had to get them to
give Faith another chance but she didn't know how to go about it.</p>

<p>Then there was the matter of what Faith had said to her after all her
friends stormed off. First the brunette had been telling her to go after
Parker, and then she mentioned someone old, and from the look in her eyes
when she said she had only been joking Buffy knew it had been a serious
question.</p>

<p>She knew before everything happened Faith flirted with her all the time but
she figured it was because the rogue slayer liked making her uncomfortable.
It had never crossed her mind that she might actually like her. When it came
down to it, Buffy realized she hardly knew the real Faith at all. Knowing
that, and that she's willing to face the wrath of all the people she cares
about to defend the brunette confused her even more. After realizing that
she wasn't getting anywhere with her thoughts Buffy headed back to campus in
hopes of finding her best friend.</p>

<hr>

<p>Xander was busying himself at Giles appartment shelving some books hoping to
get his mind off of Faith being back. As if the fact that Buffy's roommate
looked exactly like her wasn't enough, seeing the girl that used him and
tried to kill him put a huge damper in his day. He wanted to believe Buffy's
judgment of her, but Faith had a way of fooling people, which he had seen
first hand. He wasn't angry with Buffy like Willow for forgiving Faith, but
it didn't mean that he had any plans of being anything but tolerant to her
in the future, and that would only be for Buffy's sake.</p>

<p>As him and Giles bickered about the alphabet he noticed someone walking into
the appartment. "You should lock your door," Anya said as she made her
entrance.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I'm kicking myself," was Giles' reply.</p>

<p>Xander looked over at Anya a bit surprised, the last time he had seen her
she was fleeing town in terror, which he didn't fail to mention to her. She
pulled him outside and Xander shut the door behind him. "Your mother said
you were working here," she said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I need some money," he replied, wondering what she was doing back.</p>

<p>"Where is our relationship going?" She asked abruptly, and Xander thought
his eyes might bug out of his face. This was definitely the last thing he
needed at the moment. But then, maybe the distraction from Faith would be
good.</p>

<hr>

<p>'Fuck this,' Missy thought as she slammed her text book shut. Maybe she
didn't know this whole group of friends well yet, but the situation was
really starting to piss her off. She remembered Buffy pointing out which
dorm room was Willow's. Maybe it wasn't her place to intervene, but she was
going to anyways. But then, since Willow was mad at her, she had every right
to get involved in the situation.</p>

<p>Pulling on some shoes, she left for Willow's room and knocked on the door
loudly. When the red head answered the door and gave her an icy glare Missy
just shoved past her into the room. "What the hell are you pissed at me
for?" she asked before Willow even got a chance to speak.</p>

<p>"Missy?" Willow asked, just to be sure. When the brunette nodded at her,
Willow went and sat down on her bed. "Let's see, could it be because you
lied to me last night?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I did it for Buffy, and you can't tell me that under any other circumstance
you wouldn't have done the same damn thing. Ever since I got here you've
been treating me like I was Faith and I thought you finally got over that
last night."</p>

<p>"I did get over the part about you looking like Faith, but I don't need
friends that lie to me," Willow said coldly.</p>

<p>"So does that mean that your not friends with Buffy anymore, because she
lied to you?" Missy questioned.</p>

<p>"No, that doesn't mean she's not my friend. She always will be, even if she
lied. It just hurts."</p>

<p>"Then why am I any different? I try to help her out and you get pissed at me
for it. And if Buffy really were your best friend I'd think you'd trust her
enough to know what she's doing and believe her about Faith. I know Faith
hurt all of you, and I'm sorry for that but she hurt Buffy too didn't she?
From what I hear, she tried killing her boyfriend and if Buffy can forgive
that and see that Faith's a different person how can you not? Maybe you
should stop being so selfish and see that you're only hurting everyone else
by this, and yourself."</p>

<p>Missy stopped talking and walked to the door. "All I wanted was to be your
friend Willow, but I don't need friends who are so self absorbed that they
feel sorry for themselves about things like this. Too bad you couldn't get
over it and see that I'm a good person just like Buffy, and even Faith now."
Missy opened Willow's door to walk out but before she got very far she felt
a hand on her shoulder stopping her.</p>

<p>"Stay?" Willow asked softly and Missy turned around. "I'm not mad at you.
I'm just hurt. Let me at least explain my side?"</p>

<hr>

<p>When Buffy made her way back to campus she decided to head straight for
Willow's to make amends but on the way there she ran into the same guy she
had seen earlier in the dining hall. "Buffy of Stevenson wasn't it?" he
asked casually.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Parker of Kresge," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>"You going somewhere?"</p>

<p>"I've gotta go do damage control with a friend," was her reply. She knew she
had to find Willow as soon as possible, but she still let herself get
engrossed in conversation with the upperclassman.</p>

<p>Faith, who had been searching for the blonde finally spotted her as she was
making friends with the 'hottie' from before. She smiled sadly as she
noticed that Buffy seemed to be enjoying herself. She knew she couldn't deny
to herself that she had feelings for Buffy any longer, but that didn't mean
she had to share that with the older girl.</p>

<p>Besides, she couldn't stay in Sunnydale any longer. Tomorrow she'd be
leaving, she was going to do the dutiful thing and turn herself in for
murder and leave the town that she was supposed to make her home when she
first arrived there. Maybe if she hadn't have screwed up, she would still be
welcome in Sunnydale. Maybe she'd have friends and a chance with Buffy if
she hadn't, but there was no room for maybe's any longer. Leaving was the
best thing to do, if not for her than for Buffy. She didn't need to be a
burden to the blonde any longer.</p>

<p>'But that's tomorrow,' she thought to herself. 'At least for today you can
still pretend that things are fine.' After all, all she wanted was one more
night with the only person she ever cared about.</p>

<p>Missy finally left Willow's room after a very long discussion with the red
head. It had never occurred to her that Willow would feel threatened by
Faith not because she thought that she might be physically harmed, but
because she thought that Faith would take her best friend from her. When she
entered her room to find Buffy sitting on her bed a plan formed in her mind.
"Get up," Missy said as she walked up to the blonde slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy hardly registered her roommate's words as she once again found herself
lost in thought. "Buffy, get up," she repeated. "You gotta go see Willow."</p>

<p>"I will later. I'm not in the mood to grovel right now."</p>

<p>"Aww, poor Buffy feels sorry for herself. What's with this whole damn town
feeling sorry for themselves?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we all just have a lot on our minds," Buffy snapped.</p>

<p>"Tear. I'm heartbroken. Now go."</p>

<p>"Why?" Buffy asked, not really liking the way her friend was speaking to
her.</p>

<p>"Because I just spent a lot of time talking Willow into forgiving you, and
giving Faith another chance and if you don't go talk to her soon then all my
effort will be put to waste."</p>

<p>"Huh? How did you…?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. Just go talk to her."</p>

<p>Buffy stood from her bed with a smile on her face. She didn't know how the
girl did it, but she must be one hell of a talker if she can get Willow to
cave that easily. "Thanks," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Don’t sweat it. Just tell me where I can find Faith." Missy replied, hoping
that things would go as smoothly as she hoped they would.</p>

<p>"Well it's kinda dark now so I'd say she's probably hanging around some
graveyard. And I highly suggest you don't go out there trying to find her,"
Buffy said worried about her friends safety.</p>

<p>"I'll be fine. Just meet us at the Bronze in like…an hour or so okay?"</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes narrowed as she saw Missy's smile. "What are you up to?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Now get out of here before Willow goes somewhere and you can't
find her. Remember, Bronze- one hour." Missy decided to leave Buffy with
that and she set off to find Faith.</p>

<hr>

<p>Xander stood from his bed and began to put his clothes back on as he watched
Anya do the same. "I think I'm over you now," she said as she pulled her
shirt over her head.</p>

<p>"Um, okay," Xander replied.</p>

<p>"Okay!?" Anya asked, obviously upset that he was okay with it.</p>

<p>"Not okay?" He said, hoping to calm the girl down. He really had no idea of
what she wanted, and started to think that maybe all women were that
confusing. He was at least grateful for the distraction from Faith.</p>

<p>"Good, because we have parts that interlock so well together, I think we
should do that again," she told him with a hungry smile.</p>

<p>"Later Anya. I'm a man, not a God. I need at least a small recovery period.
I'm going to the Bronze for a while. You coming?"</p>

<p>"Can we interlock bodies there?"</p>

<p>"No, we can only do that when no one is around. We dance, and drink there.
Remember? Have other kinds of fun."</p>

<p>"Can we interlock after going to the Bronze?"</p>

<p>"Sure, let's just go," he answered her as he tugged on her hand and pulled
her out of his room. He stopped in front of a mirror to check his clothing
one last time before leaving his house.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Will," Buffy said softly as her best friend let her into her dorm room.
"I thought maybe we could talk for a while, then maybe go Bronzing in a
while if you're up to it?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you have a seat Buffy," Willow said as she went to sit down
herself. Buffy nodded and sat down on Willow's bed facing her best friend.</p>

<p>"Missy said that you two talked, but she didn't tell me what about. I'm
sorry if I hurt you Wills. I just can't give up on Faith."</p>

<p>Willow held up her hand and shook her head so Buffy stopped talking. "Let me
go first okay?" Buffy nodded and placed her hand over Willow's. "When Missy
came by here, we had a really long talk about everything. She made a really
good argument, and I'm starting to wonder if she should become a lawyer or
something." Willow let out a small laugh at that which caused Buffy to relax
since she realized that her and Willow wouldn't have to fight about this.</p>

<p>"She told me that if you were really my best friend, I'd trust you and your
decision on letting Faith back into all of our lives. When I tried to remind
her of how dangerous Faith was in the past she made me realize that you'd
never let her hurt us again."</p>

<p>"It's true Willow. I've messed up in the past and gotten all of you hurt, by
Faith and Angelus but you know I'd rather die than let anyone hurt my
friends. I'd do anything to protect you, even if it were Faith that was
trying to hurt you. I'd never let her do it again. But I can assure you that
she wouldn't even think about something like that now."</p>

<p>"Well I don't really believe that yet, but I'm willing to give her a chance
to prove it. It just hurt Buffy, because it's always like you choose her
over me. Like I'm not as important."</p>

<p>"That's not how it is Willow. You're one of the most important people in my
life. You've been my best friend for a few years now, and you'll always be
important to me. It's just different with Faith. Maybe because we're both
slayers, but it's like she's a part of me and I just can't give up on her.
No one could ever replace my Wills though," Buffy said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Now give me a hug," Buffy told her, and the two proceeded to
embrace each other. "So everything's okay with us and Faith being back?"
Buffy asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yeah, for now. But if she screws up-"</p>

<p>"You can do some scary magic stuff to her. Promise I won't stop ya." The two
best friends stood up and smiled at each other, glad to be on even ground
again. "So you up for some fun at the Bronze?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but only if we can go get my Oz first." Buffy nodded and the two best
friends walked out of the room, arm in arm with matching smiles on their
faces.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Okay, this is starting to border along the lines of creepy," Missy said
aloud even though she was by herself. She walked through Restfield Cemetery
with wide eyes, hoping she could find the brunette slayer before another
vampire found her. She heard a twig snap behind her and she spun around to
face the direction where the sound came from. The cross necklace Buffy gave
to her was being held in a death grip in front of her to scare off a
vampire, or at least slow him down if it had been one.</p>

<p>"It's wicked dangerous to be out here at night you know, unless you have a
death wish or something," Faith said, startling Missy.</p>

<p>"I had to find you. We've got to get to the Bronze."</p>

<p>"Is something wrong?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. You're a dumbass and you're going to tell Buffy how you feel
tonight."</p>

<p>Faith let out a hearty laugh at that and just stared at Missy. She couldn't
believe someone actually had the nerve to call her a dumbass, but it felt
good to know that there was actually someone who wasn't afraid of her.  "I
may be a dumbass, but I'm one with good intentions. Ruining B's life isn't
one of them."</p>

<p>"Well then I suggest you tell her how you feel then, or you will. I put
forth a lot of effort today and you are coming with me whether you like it
or not."  Missy grabbed Faith's hand and tried to pull her along but she
quickly noticed that she couldn't even make Faith budge.</p>

<p>"Slayer strength. Can't get enough of it ya know?" Faith teased.</p>

<p>"Fine, I can't make you go if you don't want. You're only hurting yourself
and Buffy. I talked Willow into giving you another chance you know. I've got
her and Buffy meeting us at the Bronze, and I suggest you come."</p>

<p>"I'll go, but it doesn't mean that I'm telling B how I feel about her."
Faith began walking towards the Bronze and Missy walked by her side.</p>

<p>"At least tell her that you're leaving. If she lets you go, then I won't
ever bother you about this again."</p>

<p>"My leaving or not isn't B's choice to make. I've gotta go whether she wants
me to or not."</p>

<p>"Right, oh already completely whipped one," Missy responded with a laugh.
Faith glared at her, but Missy just made a face at her and laughed harder.</p>

<hr>

<p>"See Anya, people can have fun without interlocking," Xander said as he
pointed out all the couples on the dance floor.</p>

<p>"Yeah but interlocking is so much more fun. Can't we go back to your place
now?" Anya whined.</p>

<p>"Not yet, it's still too early. Hey, look it's my favorite slayer, wolf and
hacker," Xander pointed to the trio as they made their way into the Bronze.
It didn't take long for Buffy and Willow to reach their usual table up by
the stage and join Xander and Anya. "So I take it you two made up?" Xander
questioned due to the fact that last time he saw Willow she seemed to be
furious with her best friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah, we're still bestest buds," Willow said proudly. Xander nodded his
approval, glad to see that everything worked out for them.</p>

<p>"What about you Xander? Are you okay with the Faith thing?" Buffy asked, a
pleading look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Who's Faith? She's not Xander's orgasm friend is she?" Anya questioned as
she looked at the gang.</p>

<p>Xander's eyes went wide in shock again, and he stood up. "I think I'm going
to go get something to drink," he announced before taking off. Anya wasn't
even two seconds behind him, calling out his name while she followed him.</p>

<p>"I thought she was gone?" Oz wondered out loud.</p>

<p>"Buffy?"</p>

<p>The blonde turned to where the now familiar voice was coming from and
smiled. "Hey Parker," she replied.</p>

<p>"I was wondering if you'd maybe dance with me?" He asked almost shyly.</p>

<p>Buffy looked hesitant, knowing that Faith and Missy would probably show up
at any time. "Go for it Buffy," Willow said encouraging her. "If they show
up we'll entertain them."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're okay with that?" Willow and Oz both said they were so
Buffy took Parker's preoffered hand and let him lead her to the dance floor.
She found it strange that as she looked at Parker now the only thing she
could think of was Faith's earlier statement about starting a relationship
with 'someone old'.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I can't do this," Faith said as she tried to turn around and walk out of
the Bronze.</p>

<p>"Yes you can, and you will," Missy told Faith as she stopped the slayer from
leaving.</p>

<p>"But she's dancing with that guy. And everyone's here. They all hate me."</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe not. But you don't want them to hate you do you?" Faith shook
her 'no' and Missy gave her a knowing smile. "The only way they'll like you
more is if you talk to them. Apologize and try to be nice. The hardest part
is already over."</p>

<p>"What about B? She's having fun with that jerk over there." Missy started
walking towards the gang and Faith hesitantly followed behind her.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about her, I've got it covered. Just remember you owe me big
time when you get your girl."</p>

<p>Faith didn't even get a chance to respond to what Missy told her because she
notice that Willow and Oz had spotted her. She remembered the red head's
warning about not coming around so she held her hands up in the air, as if
she were about to be arrested. "I come in peace?" she offered, hoping that
Willow would let her hang around.</p>

<p>"You don't have to worry about us," Willow said as Faith and Missy sat down.
"I think it's safe to say that we can all get along now, I think."</p>

<p>"What about X-man? He gonna try to skin me alive when he comes back over
here?" Faith questioned, almost seriously.</p>

<p>"You're safe, really." Missy said. "I'm going to get Buffy. Faith's got
something she wants to tell everyone."</p>

<p>Faith's jaw dropped as she looked at Missy. "Everyone my ass! I agreed to
tell Buffy, not all of them."</p>

<p>"Oops, so sorry." Missy gave Faith a wicked smile and walked to the dance
floor to retrieve the blonde. "Mind if I cut in here?" Missy shouted out
loud enough to be heard over the loud music and get Buffy's attention. Buffy
stopped dancing and looked at her, while Parker's smile grew and he stepped
closer to Missy. "It's her I want buddy, not you." She put her hand on his
chest to stop him and turned around to start dancing with the blonde.</p>

<p>"Never knew you wanted me," Buffy teased as she started dancing with Missy,
leaving a rejected Parker to watch them.</p>

<p>"I don't, but Faith does. She's got this idea about leaving, and I just
wanted to tell you before hand that if you let her go you'll be the biggest
idiot in the world."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped dead in her tracks and looked at Missy slack jawed. Missy took
that as her que and grabbed Buffy's hand to lead her back to the table.
Buffy didn't offer any protest and let herself be led back to the gang.</p>

<p>"Hey," Faith said softly to Buffy when she got close enough.</p>

<p>Buffy just smiled at her and sat down next the brunette. Almost out of
instinct she reached for Faith's hand under the table and felt her self
relax a little as their fingers entwined. Faith swallowed hard, realizing
how hard it really would be to leave Buffy right after they just made up.</p>

<p>"So Faith," Missy prompted, trying to get Faith to tell the gang about her
wanting to leave.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we wait for Xander to get back?" Faith asked, trying her best to
stall.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Willow asked as she looked from Missy to Faith.</p>

<p>"Tell 'em Faith."</p>

<p>"I...I'm leaving tomorrow." After that Faith felt Buffy squeezing her hand
tighter, but she didn't dare look at the blonde. "The only way I can make up
for the things I did is if I turn myself into jail for killing the people I
did. I don't want to go, but it's the only way to redeem myself." Even
though she couldn't bring herself to look at the blonde she let her thumb
softly stroke the back of Buffy's hand in as much comfort as she could
offer.</p>

<p>Oz nodded, and looked like he was about to say something but Willow spoke
before he got the chance. "Are you sure? I mean, I know I'm not your biggest
fan or anything but you'd be able to redeem yourself a lot better by
like...fighting vampires and saving lives than behind bars."</p>

<p>"It's for the best Red. For all of you if you don't have to see me again. I
gotta go, I've got some plans to make." Faith stood from the table still
holding Buffy's hand in hers and nodded to the group. She knew if she looked
at Buffy she wouldn't be able to leave so she let go of her hand and walked
out of the Bronze without stopping to look back.</p>

<p>"You are an idiot," Missy told Buffy coldly.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I can feel that way about her though," was Buffy's sad
reply. "There wasn't enough time to figure it out."</p>

<p>"You love her. Do you need me to spell it out for you? All this time I
thought it was just a joke about blondes being dense, but you just proved
it's true. I hope you enjoy living your life wondering what could have been
if you would have stopped her from going." Missy got up and walked away from
the table noticing that Buffy looked like she were about to cry. Willow was
looking at her with an expression of shock. She knew it was not only from
the fact that she just said Buffy was in love with Faith, but that she would
even talk that way to Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at Willow, her eyes begging for her best friend to tell her
what she should do. "You love her?" the red head asked even though she could
see the answer in Buffy's sad eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think I might."</p>

<p>"Then go," Willow said, not even having to think about it.</p>

<p>"How do you feel about it?" Buffy questioned, seeking the approval of her
friend.</p>

<p>"What I feel doesn't matter now. Even if I don't understand it, I'm not the
one who's going to hurt over it. Plus, it's not like I could judge you for
it since there was that whole kinda gay evil me thing before."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and smiled at her friends. "I'll see you guys tomorrow. Tell
Xander I said bye." Buffy searched around the Bronze and saw Missy, who was
watching her from across the room. She flashed her a smile before making her
exit, hoping that she would be able to find Faith.</p>

<p>Missy let herself smile proudly as she watched Buffy leave. Things hadn't
gone as smooth as she planned, but they went and now she could move on to
better things. Like finding someone for herself for example.</p>

<p>"Where did Buffy go?" Parker asked as he walked up to Missy.</p>

<p>The brunette just rolled her eyes at him. "What, do I look like her mother
or something?" And with that she walked back to the table where her new
friends were, leaving Parker out to dry once again.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Stupid, stupid, stupid," Faith muttered over and over again to herself as
she threw some clothes in an old book bag. She had gone back to the old
apartment the mayor got her in hopes that she'd be able to find some of her
old things to take with her to LA. She vaguely noticed that the place had
been fixed up again  and that there were a few things laying around that
weren't there before but she didn't bother to look around. All she wanted
was to get what she needed and leave.</p>

<p>"Going somewhere?"</p>

<p>'Fuck, why is she doing this,' was the first thing Faith thought when she
heard Buffy's voice behind her. She hadn't expected the blonde to come after
her at all. "You know I am. How'd you find me?" Faith asked as she walked
into her closet to grab a few shirts.</p>

<p>"Well I didn't want to waste time searching the whole town so I called the
psychic friends network and asked them." Buffy joked and tried to get closer
to Faith, but the brunette just walked past her as if she weren't even
there. "Just stop and look at me Faith."</p>

<p>"I can't B. I gotta leave and I can't do that if I look at you."</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed Faith's arm and used her free hand to lift Faith's chin up.
"Open your eyes," she commanded. When Faith didn't do anything Buffy shook
her head. "Please Faith, I need you to look at me."</p>

<p>Cautiously, Faith opened her eyes and saw Buffy's looking right back at her.
"Why are you doing this B?"</p>

<p>"What do you see Faith?" Buffy questioned as she let her hand go from
holding Faith's arm down to holding her hand.</p>

<p>"I see you B," Faith replied, sounding confused. Buffy let out a small laugh
at Faith's perplexed expression.</p>

<p>"Look harder," Buffy whispered as she moved a little closer to Faith.</p>

<p>"Your eyes?" Faith tried again.</p>

<p>"What's in them?" Buffy questioned almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I...I don't know B."</p>

<p>"It's sadness Faith," Buffy told her. "I can't let you leave. Stay, or else
it'll never go away." Buffy reached her hand up to push a few strands of
hair behind Faith's ear.</p>

<p>"What about the cops? They'll be after me now that I'm out of a coma." Faith
now found that her and Buffy were even closer together and her heart started
beating faster as she found it harder and harder to talk.</p>

<p>"We'll find a way. Just stay. I need you to stay." Faith could only nod, all
her resolve melting into nothing as she felt Buffy wrap her arms around her
waist. When she felt Buffy resting her head on her shoulder Faith let
herself embrace the blonde. "Don't ever leave Faith. Let Sunnydale be your
home," Buffy said softly.</p>

<p>Faith only smiled as she let herself stroke the blonde's hair. "Sunnydale
can never be my home B."</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at her, hoping that she wasn't still going to leave. "Why
Faith?"</p>

<p>Faith pulled away from Buffy and sat down on her old bed and held Buffy's
hands in her own as she smiled up at her. "Sunnydale is just a place to rest
my head. It's a place to spend my days and nights but it'll never be home.
I've never had a home before, just a place to 'hang my hat' as they say. But
that changed the day I met you. You're my home B. No, you're not a place
where I live but if home is where the heart is, then you're it."</p>

<p>"Faith," Buffy managed to choke out even though there was an incredible lump
in her throat after hearing what Faith just said to her. "If I wasn't
positive before, I know for sure now. I love you."</p>

<p>Faith felt as if her heart could beat out of her chest when Buffy said that
and she stood back up and placed her palm on Buffy's cheek. "I love you too
B." Faith let her thumb lightly brush over Buffy's bottom lip and quickly
replaced it with her lips in a whisper of a kiss still afraid that Buffy
might not want the same thing she did. When she felt Buffy's hand around her
neck pulling her closer she knew it was okay and deepened the kiss with the
blonde.</p>

<p>When the two pulled apart Faith just held Buffy in her arms, fighting back
the tears of happiness that she wanted to cry. She didn't believe she ever
did anything in her life to deserve this, but she knew she'd spend what was
left of it making Buffy happy. "Let's go," Faith said softly. She didn't
really want to spend her first night with Buffy back at the dorm where Missy
would be, but the apartment still carried too many bad memories for both of
them.</p>

<p>"Let's go to my mom's," Buffy told her. "I know we'll have to deal with her
and all, but at least we'll be able to be alone there once we get past her."</p>

<p>"The fun never stops with you," Faith joked.</p>

<p>"Damn straight," Buffy retorted as she gave Faith a quick kiss.</p>

<p>"Actually, neither of us are really straight now," Faith said with a smile.</p>

<p>Buffy just shook her head as Faith grabbed the book bag from her old bed. "A
smartass is what you are," Buffy told her with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Funny you should say that since Missy told me I was a dumbass earlier. You
people need to get your stories straight."</p>

<p>"But I thought we weren't straight," Buffy teased, glad to continue the
banter as the two left the apartment. They could deal with the memories from
that place at another time, but now wasn't it.</p>

<p>"You like trying to confuse me don't you?" Faith smiled as Buffy slipped her
hand into hers and they walked down the street, perfectly content and happy.
At least for the next few minutes until Faith had to face Buffy's mom.</p>

<p>Buffy walked into her mom's house dragging the reluctant slayer behind her
by the hand. "Hey B I think there's some vamps that need dusting so while
you talk to your mom I'll just go and…"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head at Faith and let out a small laugh, obviously ignoring
her attempts of getting out of the situation. "Mom, are you home?" Buffy
called out from the bottom of the stairs, almost hoping there would be no
response so she could have the night with Faith alone. Unfortunately for
both slayers, they heard Joyce walking around upstairs after Buffy called
out her name.</p>

<p>"Is everything okay Buffy? Why are you here so late?" Joyce asked as she
walked down the stairs. When she noticed the dark haired girl standing
behind her daughter she immediately stiffened, and her eyes narrowed.
"Faith," she said flatly as she stared the girl down.</p>

<p>"Mom, Faith's kinda awake now but she's good and we need a place to stay
tonight so can we stay here?" Buffy asked quickly even though she already
knew it would take more than that to convince her mom of Faith's being good.</p>

<p>"And I'm Betty Davis," Joyce said. Faith wanted to laugh at her attempt of
making a sarcastic remark, but she knew since she was here to defend
herself, laughing at the person you're trying to convince something of isn't
a good tactic. "What have you done to my daughter Faith?"</p>

<p>"I didn't do anything," Faith answered, becoming serious again. "I'm sorry
for everything I did before. I just want to make it up to all of you.
B…Buffy's given me another chance and so has the rest of the Scooby gang. I
just want another chance."</p>

<p>"Why should I believe what you say? You fooled us all before and put my
daughter's life in danger. I don't think it's quite that simple Faith,"
Joyce snapped. Buffy noticed Faith wince and knew how bad her mother's words
were hurting her girlfriend.</p>

<p>Buffy took hold of Faith's hand once more and stood half in front of the
brunette in a protective manner. "I won't say that you're wrong for being
angry with Faith. You have every right after all that happened. But you are
wrong if you won't give her another chance. Out of the people that she hurt
when she turned against us, who did she hurt the most?" Buffy asked her
mother. She felt Faith grip her hand tighter and she knew it was just as
painful for Faith to have to do this as it was for her.</p>

<p>"She hurt you the most Buffy. Why do you think I can't forgive her? I'm your
mother and it's my job to protect you," Joyce told her.</p>

<p>"You're right about one thing, that she hurt me the most. If I, of all
people, can forgive her and see the good that's in her, why can't you? I'm
an adult now mom, I don't need you to protect me anymore." Buffy stopped
talking and turned around to face her girlfriend. "Come on, let's go back to
the dorm since we obviously aren't welcome here," she said softly, hoping
that she could make the pained expression in her girlfriend's eyes disappear
somehow.</p>

<p>The two slayers began to make their exit, but just before they got out the
door they heard Joyce calling out to them. When they turned around they saw
the older woman looking at them regretfully. "I'm sorry, just give me some
time to come to terms with you being back Faith. If Buffy trusts you, then
I'll try to as well."</p>

<p>Both slayers flashed brilliant smiles at her and Joyce knew she made the
right decision. "Thank you Miss S. I'll prove to you that I'm good again,"
Faith told her as she walked out of the house. She turned around to see her
girlfriend giving her mother a hug and smiled at the two of them. It made
her wonder what ever made her decide being bad was better than being good in
the first place. Maybe it was easier, but it was far less rewarding. Not to
mention boring since you can't really make friends when you're trying to
kill them all.</p>

<p>"Whatcha thinking?" Buffy asked as she closed the door to her mom's house
and moved closer to Faith.</p>

<p>"Just that I like being on your side better than trying to fight you," she
said softly as she gave Buffy a quick kiss. "It's much more rewarding."
Faith took Buffy's hand into her own and the two walked down the street back
to Buffy's dorm where they hoped they'd be able to get rid of Missy somehow.
Unbeknownst to them, Joyce had been watching them from the window and saw
them kiss. She just shook her head, hoping that her daughter wouldn't get
hurt again. Joyce could only be thankful that at least Faith wasn't a
vampire.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Okay guys, I think it's time for me to head back. It was nice hanging with
you all tonight without all the tension like before," Missy said to the
group of friends as she stood from the table.</p>

<p>"Just remember that Xander's mine now," Anya told her with a smile as she
held onto Xander's arm.</p>

<p>"Like I'd want him," Missy said suddenly and her eyes went wide in surprise
of what she said. "Not that there's anything wrong with you Xander, I
just...Not my type?" Missy offered weakly and Xander just smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'm used to rejection," he told her. Missy laughed as she
waved goodbye and started to walk away from the group but she heard Willow
calling her name.</p>

<p>"You know it is pretty late and I have an early class tomorrow so I should
probably go too. We could give you a ride back in Oz's van. It's quicker and
not quite as vampire-y as it is if you were walking. And it's good because
vampires are bad and then they go grr and it's not fun so if you rode with
us it'd be fun because we're fun people."</p>

<p>Missy laughed, this being the first time she's seen Willow go into babble
mode and found it endearing. "Chill Willow, I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"Does this mean we can go have more orgasms now?" Anya asked Xander,
embarrassing him for the millionth time that night. Xander just nodded and
the two left the Bronze without saying anything else. Missy just shook her
head at them, amazed that she found someone with a bigger sex drive than
Jan.</p>

<p>Missy, Willow and Oz were right behind them and they made their way back to
the campus quickly. Oz dropped them off near Stevenson hall and Missy waited
for Willow so she could walk the red head back to her room. When they
reached Willow's room the duo saw the slayers walking up to them hand in
hand. "Glad to see you two worked things out," Missy said as she gave them a
proud look.</p>

<p>"Yeah, thanks for being brave enough to call me a dumbass," Faith winked at
her. "I'll get you back for that one day."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you try," Missy retorted, knowing full well that Faith
wouldn't do anything to her. Willow watched the exchange between the two
girls, amazed at not only how much they look alike but also how close their
personalities matched. She was still uncomfortable around Faith but she knew
that if Buffy loved her than she must be a better person and worth giving a
chance to.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes of Faith and Missy's banter Buffy tugged on Faith's
arm indicating it was time to move on to some more fun things back in the
room. "Are you two staying in the room tonight?" Missy asked and they both
nodded. "I feel bad. It's your first night together as being together and
I'll be there kinda ruining it."</p>

<p>"It's better than the alternatives," Buffy said even though she really
wished that Missy wouldn't be there as well. She liked having her roommate
around, but she thought it was about time her and Faith got some real time
alone.</p>

<p>"You can stay here tonight," Willow said to Missy hesitantly. She wasn't
very sure if she liked the idea or not, but it would help her best friend
out so she was willing to try. "My roommate's always at her boyfriends, and
it's better than being alone so if you wanted to stay you could. But if you
don't it's okay. I was just trying to be helpful because it's nice to be
helpful."</p>

<p>Missy grinned again at the red head's babble and nodded. "You know, I think
I might just take you up on that offer. I'll go grab some stuff from the
room and meet you back here." Missy walked back to the room and after Faith
and Buffy said their goodbyes to Willow they followed.</p>

<hr>

<p>Missy was in the room stuffing clothes into a bag when Faith and Buffy came
in. She just gave the two a smile and went back to gathering her things for
her night at Willows. By the time she finished, the two slayers were already
laying on Buffy's bed kissing and Missy found herself entranced by the
sight. Missy couldn't help but stare as she watched what was practically
herself making out with another girl. "You know, I would make one hot
lesbian," Missy thought out loud which caused the two slayers to break
apart.</p>

<p>Buffy was blushing and Faith just grinned at her. "You should try it
sometime." She turned to Buffy and her smile grew even larger. "Her and Red
would make a hot couple don't you think?"</p>

<p>Missy and Buffy's eyes grew larger as they stared at Faith. "Don't get any
ideas Faith, I like men just fine." When Buffy started making stuttering
sounds Missy stopped talking and both brunette's looked at the blonde,
trying to hold back their laughs.</p>

<p>"Chill B, I was just joking. Red's like the straightest girl I know." Faith
rubbed Buffy's back in a calming manner and the blonde relaxed.</p>

<p>"Okay, I'm outta here. You two can get back to whatever it is you were
doing." Missy gave them a smile but before she could leave Faith stopped
her.</p>

<p>"Be gentle with Red, she's the sensitive type." Faith winked at Missy and
Buffy's mouth just hung open again as she wondered what her girlfriend was
implying.  Missy shook her head and walked out, a knowing smile on her lips
and walked back down to Willow's room.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Missy left the two slayers cuddled on Buffy's bed and just held each
other in silence for a while. Buffy was resting her head on Faith's chest,
enjoying the feel of it rising and falling with every breath. She could feel
the brunette tracing patterns on her back with her fingers and she was sure
that she would melt into the brunette at any moment. "This is nice," Buffy
said softly.</p>

<p>"Mmm, it is," Faith murmured. "But you know what's better?" she asked as her
smile grew.</p>

<p>"There's something better than this?" Buffy questioned as she lifted her
head up so she could look at her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," Faith said as she slid two fingers under Buffy's chin and brought
the blonde's lips to her own. She slid her tongue over Buffy's bottom lip
before letting it sneak into her mouth to continue its exploration. Buffy
moaned softly and moved her body so she was half laying on the brunette and
half off as she deepened the kiss.</p>

<p>Faith wrapped her arms around Buffy's waist and pulled her closer, suddenly
craving more contact with her girlfriend. Buffy could feel Faith trying to
press her body up into her own as her hands slid under Buffy's shirt. Buffy
realized where this was going so she broke the kiss. "Wait Faith," she
whispered softly as she caught her breath.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry B. Did I do something wrong?" the brunette asked, afraid that she
had tried to move too fast.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at her reassuringly and gave Faith a quick kiss. "It's not that
baby. I want to...you know. It's just that I've never done this before. I
mean I have, just not with a girl and I don't really know what to do so I'm
kind of scared," Buffy confessed, hoping she didn't babble too much trying
to get that out.</p>

<p>Faith sighed in relief and rolled the blonde onto her back. "Then let me
show you B. Let me take care of you and make love to you, please?" Faith
asked. Her voice was filled with so much love and desire that Buffy could
only nod in response. Faith was amazed that Buffy actually wanted the same
thing and she once again claimed her lips with her own. When they broke
apart she brought the blonde into a sitting position and slowly lifted her
shirt off. "Just relax Buffy," Faith whispered just before kissing the
blonde again. Buffy was so shocked that Faith had used her whole name her
nervousness floated away and she did just as asked, glad to get lost in the
sensations of Faith's hands on her.</p>

<hr>

<p>"You have no idea how glad I am to be here," Missy said as she reclined on
Willow's bed. "The two were down each other's throats before I even got out
of the room. You have no idea how weird it is to see yourself with another
girl."</p>

<p>Willow laughed after Missy said that knowing by the look on the brunette's
face that she didn't really mind. "Actually I do know what it's like,"
Willow said as she sat down next to Missy on her bed. "When we were still in
high school Anya messed some things up and there was this vampire me from
another reality and she was kinda gay."</p>

<p>"Kinda gay? Is there such a thing?" Missy questioned as she rolled on her
side to face Willow. She had expected the night to be a million times more
awkward than it was since it was only recently that the two truly became
friends.</p>

<p>"Well there's bisexual people so isn't that kinda gay, or are they just
confused?"</p>

<p>Missy laughed, the red head had a point. "So then the vampire you was
bisexual?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I guess she was more than kinda gay. It was kind of freaky at
first but I guess it doesn't bother me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess so," Missy said. She briefly thought about bringing up what
Faith said about how they'd make a cute couple but she didn't think Willow
would find it funny. Of course, even if Willow didn't find it funny she was
sure she'd find Willow's reaction funny. "You know, before I left Faith said
you and I would make a cute couple."</p>

<p>Willow's mouth dropped and she turned a few shades redder as she stared at
Faith. "I... You and me? I have Oz. I love Oz," Willow nodded to help prove
her point and Missy held back a laugh. "Not that anything's wrong with
liking girls because it's okay I mean if you do or anyone else but Oz. I
have an Oz," Willow concluded finally and Missy let her laugh out.</p>

<p>"She was right, you are sensitive. I'm just as straight as you, at least
last time I checked. It's what she said, not me so just take a deep breath
okay?" Willow did as she was told and finally relaxed again. "You have an
early class tomorrow don't you?" Willow nodded and Missy stood up from the
bed with a small sigh. "Just give me a pillow and a blanket and I'll crash
here on the floor."</p>

<p>"You can't sleep on the floor. It's hard and cold and I have a bed," Willow
said and shook her head.</p>

<p>"You sayin' you wanna sleep with me Willow?" Missy asked with a smirk.
Willow started stuttering again and Missy laughed. "Okay, enough sarcastic
girl. I'm sorry Willow. I was just joking. Ha, ha, funny type stuff you
know?"</p>

<p>"I know it's just with Buffy and Faith and...God, I sound like an idiot
don't I?"</p>

<p>"No, it's cute actually. You're like a little kid who's afraid they'll send
their gayness to you like cooties or something."</p>

<p>Willow realized what Missy was saying is true and she felt like the biggest
dope in the world. Ever since her encounter with her vampire self she had
been afraid that there was some part of her that was gay but it was just
lying dormant. Now with Buffy and Faith being together, and just Faith being
back all together she'd been super spazzy lately. "I want you to sleep with
me, just in the non gay way." Willow paused and Missy smiled to herself.
'You just keep telling yourself that Willow,' she thought to herself, then
wondered what the hell made her think that in the first place. "You're like
my guest and it's not right to make you sleep on the floor. "</p>

<p>"Yeah sure," Missy said and she crawled into Willow's bed. Willow turned out
the lights and crawled in next to her new friend. The bed was fairly small
and as the two lay next to each other they realized there was no way to
sleep without their bodies touching each others. Willow quickly fell asleep,
and sleep wasn't far behind for Missy. 'Maybe Faith was right, me and Willow
would make a cute couple,' was Missy's last thought before joining her
friend in slumber.</p>

<p>The next morning the two slayers woke to the sound of the door being pounded
on. Buffy grumbled loudly and untangled herself from Faith's arms so she
could answer it. She thought it might be Missy and that she had forgotten
her key otherwise she wouldn't have even bothered to get up. Buffy was more
than a little surprised when she opened the door to find Cordelia standing
there. "Cordelia," Buffy said surprised. "What are you doing here? And so
early in the morning…" Buffy pointed out, sounding slightly annoyed even
though it was already noon.</p>

<p>"Yeah, isn't that bad for your pores or something?" Faith asked grumpily
from the bed and Cordelia noticed her for the first time.</p>

<p>Cordelia's eyes went wide in surprise as she saw Faith for the first time
and she shot Buffy a questionable look. "I knew you liked bad boy's but what
the hell is Faith doing in your bed?"</p>

<p>"Not that it should matter to you, but she's good now and she's my
girlfriend. Now why are you here?" Buffy stepped aside allowing Cordelia
entrance into the room for the first time and the ex cheerleader sat on the
other bed.</p>

<p>"First off, eww. Secondly, I needed a break from the LA scene. Angel's still
all broody and it started to depress me. So anyways I thought I'd come back
here and see you all. Xander told me to come find you since his girlfriend
was intent on having more orgasms," Cordelia shook her head in disgust at
the thought.</p>

<p>"So, are we supposed to entertain you or something?" Faith asked jokingly.</p>

<p>"Well it would be a start," Cordelia told her arrogantly.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head but smiled. She knew Cordy was trying to sound like a
bitch because that was her method of protection. It was a sort of
self-defense thing. "I've got classes all day." She gave Faith a quick kiss,
not really caring what Cordelia's reaction might be. "You can keep her
entertained while I'm gone," Buffy told her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"You want her to keep me busy? Hello, last time I saw her she wanted to kill
us and now I'm supposed to spend time with her?"</p>

<p>"I've got a better idea. Missy can entertain Queen C and I'll sleep."</p>

<p>Missy chose then to walk into her dorm room and she caught the end of
Faith's sentence. "Who am I entertaining?" she asked as she noticed the girl
sitting on her bed. Cordy did a double take when she saw the brunette
walking into the room.</p>

<p>"I'm not seeing things am I? Because there's two Faith's in here and that's
kind of creepy. "</p>

<p>"This is my roommate Missy, and yes she does look exactly like Faith. Why
don't you two try getting along and tonight we'll all have a sleepover at
mom's or something since she's got another auction." Buffy grabbed some
clothes and went into the bathroom to change.</p>

<p>"Hey Missy, what to do you say to spending the day with the ice queen here?
I think you two would get along good, and then I'd get to sleep." Faith
smiled and positioned herself more comfortably in Buffy's bed.</p>

<p>"Well what do we have in common then o wise one?" Missy asked jokingly as
she sat down on her bed next to Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Other than B, you're both the only ones with enough balls to speak your
mind to me and not be afraid of me kicking your ass for it."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well I know you're still afraid of my spatula of death."  Faith and
Missy both broke out into laughter at that. Even though Missy didn't know
what she was talking about, the phrase 'spatula of death' was still funny.
If nothing else it eased the tension in the room considerably.</p>

<p>"So what time is it?" Missy asked. When she woke up alone in Willow's dorm
room she felt incredibly awkward and rushed out of there without even
noticing the time. Cordy informed her that it was almost noon and she was
surprised that she managed to sleep that late.</p>

<p>Buffy came back into to the room and grabbed her books. "So are you all
going to be able to play nice today?" All three nodded at her and she gave
Faith another kiss. "I'll tell Willow that we're having a sleepover when I
see her. Be at my mom's at five," Buffy said with a sweet smile. "Faith and
Cordelia both know the way so if you stick with one of them you'll be able
to get there," she said to Missy. "If you want to come and all that is."</p>

<p>After that Buffy made her way out of the door for class. "So are you ever
going to get up or what?" Cordelia asked. Faith's grin grew, and she
actually thought about getting up but Buffy would actually kill her if she
did that now.</p>

<p>"I don't think you want me to C. Unlike B, I sleep in the buff. So unless
you wanna see my goodies…" Cordelia held up her hand and Faith stopped
talking.</p>

<p>"So you wanna get out of here and do something? I figure I can keep you
company and you could show me around town since I haven't gotten familiar
with it yet."</p>

<p>"Deal," Cordy said with a smile. "Be good Faith."</p>

<p>Faith just grinned at them as they walked out. She was glad she wouldn't be
there interfering with them. Of course now, she had to reconsider her
position on Missy and Willow being a cute couple. Suddenly Cordelia seemed
so much more appropriate.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some hours later Cordelia and Missy were walking around the mall, actually
enjoying each other's company. "You're actually from LA?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but we moved senior year and then I ended up here," Missy told her.</p>

<p>"How can you move from LA to here? Are you insane?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," Missy grinned at her. "But I wanted to get away from all that
stuff. After last year I just wanted to slow things down a bit and come to
someplace small. You don't ever miss it here?" she asked as they went into
another store.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't miss this place. I miss some of the people but Sunnydale
itself sucks," Cordy spotted a shirt she liked and held it up to her. "What
do you think?"</p>

<p>"It's nice if you're going for the 'I'm a total slut' look," Missy said with
a laugh as she looked through some other clothes. "And Sunnydale isn't so
bad. It's got some weird stuff going on but it's a lot less stressful being
here than it was at home. The only thing I really miss is cheerleading."</p>

<p>"You were a cheerleader?" Missy nodded her confirmation and Cordy grinned at
her. "I guess Faith was right, we do have a lot in common."</p>

<hr>

<p>Faith was walking around the UC Sunnydale campus trying to figure out to do
for the next hour. Buffy had said to meet at her mom's at five, but Faith
knew the blonde was probably already over there setting things up. She just
didn't want to seem over eager, but then when did she start caring about
that stuff? She grinned to herself and set off on her way to see her
girlfriend. Besides, if she got there early, they might be able to have a
little fun before everyone came.</p>

<p>"I…I'm s-sorry," Faith heard a girl stutter from behind her. She spun around
and saw a blonde girl looking up at some beefstick and he was looking down
at her angrily. "I d-didn't mean to," she said softly.</p>

<p>"You better not ever do it again. It's not like you're blind," the guy said
and Faith noticed the girl looked a little scared. The guy gave her one last
glare and walked away. Faith didn't know why, but she felt like she should
make sure the girl was okay.</p>

<p>"Hey," she said softly as she approached the girl. "Everything five by
five?"</p>

<p>The girl looked at her and smiled weakly. "W-what's five b-by five?" she
asked softly.</p>

<p>Faith grinned even bigger at that. "You know, everything okay here? I saw
that guy being an ass so I just wanted to make sure you were okay."</p>

<p>The girl's smile grew at Faith's concern and she nodded. "I'm just new here
a-and people are being a l-little mean so far."</p>

<p>"Then you need to find the fun," Faith stated. "What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Tara," the shy blonde said as she held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Faith," the slayer replied as she shook her hand. "Come on, we're having a
girl's night over at my girlfriend's house.  You can hang with us if you
want. It'll be fun," Faith offered with her best smile. It wasn't usually
her thing to be that nice, but it was obvious the girl needed a few friends.</p>

<p>"I…I shouldn't I-impose on y-you like that."</p>

<p>"Nah, come on blondie. I'll show you that everyone around here isn't mean."
Faith gave Tara a reassuring smile and the two started walking towards
Buffy's house.</p>

<p>"What if they g-get mad?"</p>

<p>"They won't, just relax." Tara nodded, and did as Faith said. She could tell
the girl wasn't lying and she figured since her first few days on campus
were so bad she had nothing to loose.</p>

<p>"So we're going to y-your girlfriend's house?" Tara asked, making sure she
had heard right.</p>

<p>"Yeah. You don't mind that sort of thing do you?" Faith asked and Tara just
smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Not at all," she said. Maybe she had found the right group of people to be
friends with finally.</p>

<hr>

<p>"So how come Cordelia's back all of the sudden?" Willow asked as she helped
Buffy carry a few groceries into the house.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Buffy sighed. "She said she just needed to get away from
Angel brooding all the time. I think it might have something to do with
Xander though. I wonder how she felt about seeing him with Anya this
morning," Buffy said.  Just as she set the groceries down the doorbell rang
and Willow went to get it while she put the stuff away.</p>

<p>"Hey Faith," Willow greeted her as she let Faith and the other girl in.</p>

<p>"Oh, Red this is Tara," Faith said pointing to the blonde.</p>

<p>"H-hi," the shy blonde said softly as she looked at Willow.</p>

<p>"Oh, where's B?" Faith asked and her face lit up at the thought of seeing
her girlfriend. Willow pointed to the kitchen and Faith took off, leaving
Willow and Tara alone.</p>

<p>"M-maybe I should go," Tara said, feeling a little uncomfortable with the
situation.</p>

<p>"No," Willow said quickly. "I mean, if you don't have anything else to do
you should stay here. It never hurts to make new friends right? We might be
a little weird but we're fun people and yeah," Willow stopped once she
realized she was starting to babble. Tara, like most anyone who met Willow
found the babble cute and she once again relaxed. "You should meet Buffy,"
Willow said and then she realized that Tara still didn't even know her name.
"And my name's Willow. Faith just likes to give people nicknames a lot."</p>

<p>Willow and Tara walked into the kitchen and saw Faith and Buffy sharing a
very intense kiss. Both girls blushed and finally Willow cleared her throat
to get their attention. "Buffy this is Tara."</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy said with a smile. She didn't get the chance to say anything
else though because Missy and Cordelia walked into the kitchen laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't you people knock?" Faith asked them.</p>

<p>"Why? It's not like we're vamp-" Cordelia stopped when she noticed the new
girl in the room. "We brought movies," she said, changing the subject.</p>

<hr>

<p>The six of them spent the next few hours watching the movies that Cordy and
Missy brought. Tara still seemed very shy around the group of friends but
eventually they all realized she's just a shy person all together. But then
Faith had an idea about how to get her, along with the rest of the gang a
little more loosened up. As the last credits on the movie played she shut
off the tv and smiled at the group. "Okay guys, it's game time," Faith said
with a wicked grin.</p>

<p>"Oh, can we play Pictionary?" Willow asked excitedly but Faith just laughed.</p>

<p>"That's not fun enough. We'll play truth or dare," Faith said. Willow looked
at her a little skeptically along with a few others but eventually they all
agreed. After they all got comfortable on the floor they began the game.
Buffy, Cordelia and Tara had their turns, and so far everyone had picked
truth.</p>

<p>Finally it was Faith's turn to ask and she eyed them all carefully and
finally settled on her look-alike. "Truth or dare Missy?"</p>

<p>Missy studied Faith's eyes for a minute and she could tell that she was up
to something. Of course Missy wasn't the type to back down from a challenge.
"Dare," she answered.</p>

<p>Faith's grin grew and she glanced at Willow. "I dare you to kiss Red."</p>

<p>Everyone in the room looked at Faith like she was crazy. "Just because you
and Buffy are gay doesn't mean we are," Missy told her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and Oz. He's my boyfriend and that would be cheating," Cordelia
nodded furiously when she said that remembering when Willow and Xander
cheated on her. "Cheating is bad. Wrong even," Willow added and Buffy put
her hand on the red head's back to calm her down.</p>

<p>"Fine, I'll change the dare," Faith said. "Missy, I dare you to kiss Queen
C," she laughed as she said that. Missy glared at her but she still wasn't
going to back down from Faith's bet.</p>

<p>"Sorry about this Cordy," Missy said quickly.</p>

<p>Before the girl could even respond to what Missy said she felt soft lips on
hers. Much to her surprise she felt herself responding to Missy's kiss.
Everyone watched the two of them with wide eyes until they finally broke
apart. Cordelia looked at them as if nothing had just happened and Missy
smirked. "Satisfied now?" she asked Faith.</p>

<p>"Not really," Faith replied but Missy knew she was from the look on her
face.</p>

<p>"Thanks for inviting me over but I have to get back to campus now," Tara
said after the group recovered from the two girls kissing.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you have to go?" Faith asked their new friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah. But thanks for inviting me over. It was nice meeting all of you," she
said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well I'll walk you back to campus," Willow offered and she stood as well.</p>

<p>"Oh, well you don't have to. I know my way, I think," Tara admitted shyly.</p>

<p>"Really, I'll go with you," Willow said a little forcefully. "It's not safe
to walk around here by yourself at night and I don't mind." Tara finally
agreed and after a chorus of 'be careful's' the two left to make their way
back to campus.</p>

<p>"So who's sleeping where tonight?" Cordelia finally asked.</p>

<p>"Well obviously me and Faith are sleeping in my room. You two can stay in
the guest room if you want, unless one of you really wants to sleep in my
mom's bed," Buffy joked. Missy and Cordy both crumpled their faces up and
shook their heads no. "So then we'll go up there and get the room ready for
you all and you two can do whatever," Buffy said making sure to say the
whatever in a suggestive manner.</p>

<p>Both girls knew Buffy and Faith were most likely going up there to make out
some more so they sat on the couch in an awkward silence. Finally Missy
snapped out of her thoughts and looked at Cordelia. "Why did you respond to
my kiss?"</p>

<p>Cordelia looked at her, not even phased by the question. "It happened by
instinct. Usually when someone kisses you, that's what you do," she said in
a 'duh' type of voice.</p>

<p>"But you're straight right?" Missy asked.</p>

<p>"Of course. Aren't you?" Cordy quipped.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I can't say that kiss wasn't enjoyable," Missy confessed.</p>

<p>"Wanna try it again?" Cordy asked, with a bit of a dare in her voice. Missy
shrugged, acting like she didn't really care but when she looked into
Cordelia's eyes she figured 'why not?' and smiled. Both girls met in the
middle and kissed again, this time however it was a very cautious kiss. It
didn't last long, and when they broke apart Missy smiled at her.</p>

<p>"How long are you in town for?" Missy asked, remaining close to her new
friend.</p>

<p>"Just the weekend," Cordelia replied.</p>

<p>"Wanna make the most of it?" Missy challenged, and Cordy nodded. Without
saying anything else to each other they kissed again, not as shy as before.
Little did they know Buffy and Faith were just outside of the living room
watching them.</p>

<p>"Looks like we're here," Tara said to Willow as they reached her dorm room.
"T-thanks for walking me back," she added softly.</p>

<p>"It was no problem," Willow told her. "It was nice getting to know you Tara.
You should come to the Bronze with us all tomorrow night."</p>

<p>"The Bronze?" Tara asked as she unlocked her door.</p>

<p>"Yeah it's just a club where we all get together most nights. I could come
by and get you tomorrow if you wanted to come. You could meet my boyfriend
Oz, and the rest of the gang."</p>

<p>"Sure," Tara said with a smile. "D-do you wanna maybe c-come in for a
while?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Willow smiled at her and walked into the dorm room. Willow looked
around the shy blondes room. It was built just like her own was, only
decorated different. The first thing she noticed was a rather large
bookshelf and she went to look at the books. When Willow noticed they were
mostly spell books her eyes went wide. "Your a Wicca too?" Willow asked
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I-I'm nothing special but I like to practice a lot." Tara smiled at
her as she walked over to where Willow was standing.</p>

<p>"Did you know there's a Wicca club on campus? I was thinking about going to
the next meeting. You should come too," Willow said happily.</p>

<p>"Maybe I will then. Do you wanna try some spells while you're here?" Tara
asked.</p>

<p>Willow nodded enthusiastically and Tara pulled a book from the shelf. "How
long have you been practicing?"</p>

<p>"For a while now," Willow told her. "But I've never really tried anything
other than minor spells. Well except for once but that's a long story,"
Willow smiled sheepishly at her.</p>

<p>"Well then we can start with some easy spells and work our way up as time
passes," Tara said. Willow smiled at her and the two sat down on the floor,
already feeling close to one another.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning back at the Summer's residence, Buffy was the first to
wake. She tried getting Faith to get up as well, but the brunette refused to
move from her spot in the bed. "C'mon baby, please?" Buffy pouted at the
half awake brunette.</p>

<p>"No," Faith grumbled as she pulled the pillow down over her face, knowing it
would only be a matter of seconds of seeing Buffy's pouty face before she
caved.</p>

<p>Buffy was on to her though and pulled the pillow out of Faith's grasp. "I
know you can't refuse my pouty face," Buffy teased as she bent down to kiss
Faith's forehead.</p>

<p>"It's eight in the morning B, anything's possible," Faith responded before
rolling on her side so she wasn't facing her girlfriend. "Go bug Cordy and
Missy," Faith told her.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes lit up at the idea and she climbed out of her old bed. "Fine, I
will. You can stay here and be Miss Grouchy Pants," Buffy stuck her tongue
out at her girlfriend even though Faith couldn't see her.</p>

<p>Faith just chuckled softly and buried her head in the pillows. "I will," she
said softly as Buffy walked out of the room, leaving her to get more sleep.</p>

<p>The first place Buffy went was to the guest room to see if her two friends
were still asleep. When she saw that the door was open, and the bed was made
she figured that they never even made it up there last night. Missy wasn't
one to make her bed first thing in the morning, and she doubted that Cordy
was either.</p>

<p>She let out a soft yawn, almost considering going back to sleep with Faith
but now she wanted to see what the other two were up to. When she walked
into the room she let out a soft laugh upon seeing the two of them. They
were both laying on the couch, and Cordy was literally on top of Missy and
both were still asleep.  Buffy shook her head ruefully and headed back
upstairs.</p>

<p>When she got back in her room she started going through her things so she
could find something to wear. She heard Faith shifting in the bed as she
opened and closed several dresser drawers. "B, you're supposed to let me
sleep," Faith said, trying to sound angry. It was hard though, considering
her girlfriend just started changing in front of her. "Actually, now that I
think of it, I've got a few better ideas than sleep."</p>

<p>Buffy finished pulling on her jeans and smiled at Faith. "You had your
chance, but you wanted to sleep. Now I've got to get back to campus for
class."</p>

<p>"You're so mean B," Faith complained as she watched Buffy.</p>

<p>"I know, but it's why you love me." Buffy bent down and gave her girlfriend
a quick kiss. "Cordy and Missy are downstairs sleeping, so don't wake them
up. I think they probably had a long night," Buffy's grin grew as she
thought about that. "Hey, why'd you make that dare anyways?"</p>

<p>Faith shrugged slightly as she sat up in the bed, already awake, though she
wished she were sleeping still. "I thought it was funny. I never knew her
and Queen C would hit it off like that," Faith replied.</p>

<p>"I know! You're living vicariously through Missy," Faith gave Buffy a
baffled look while trying not to laugh at the expression on her face. "I
mean, you're stuck with me, so since Missy looks like you if she's with
Cordy it's like you get to see yourself with Cordy but not. I'm not making
sense am I?" Buffy asked and Faith just shook her head.</p>

<p>"Try not to think so much this early B," Faith told her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah. I'm going now," Buffy gave Faith a quick kiss. "Be good and
I'll see you tonight at the Bronze." Buffy gave her one last smile and
walked out, and Faith layed back down, hoping to get some more sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>That night the whole gang gathered at the Bronze like usual, and with Cordy
there it almost felt like old times. Buffy and Faith were out on the dance
floor, dancing to whatever the DJ played until it was time for the band that
was playing to come on. Willow was talking to the newest member of the gang,
Tara, excitedly about more spells. Oz was listening to the conversation,
though no one could actually tell if he was interested in it or not. Xander
however was the only one who wasn't at ease. He couldn't help but notice the
looks his ex girlfriend kept giving Missy, and it was starting to bother
him.</p>

<p>"So what brings you back to town?" Xander asked Cordelia, trying to see if
he could figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>"Just visiting," she said carelessly, only taking her eyes from Missy for a
brief second to look at him.</p>

<p>"Xander's mine now," Anya told her rather forcefully. "I've heard about you,
but you can't have him anymore."</p>

<p>"It's okay, I've found someone else now," Cordy replied with a smile to
Anya.</p>

<p>"Who might that be?" Xander questioned.</p>

<p>"Duh, isn't it obvious? It's Missy," Cordy told him, and his eyes went wide.</p>

<p>"You and her?" Xander asked softly. "How? When? Why?" He shook his head as
if in disbelief. He suddenly started wondering what it was with his ex's
turning gay.</p>

<p>"It just happened last night. We got down and dirty on Buffy's couch and
decided we liked it," Missy said, and no one could tell if she was actually
joking or not. It got the rest of the gang's attention, and it even seemed
as if Buffy and Faith knew things were going to get interesting because they
returned to the table.</p>

<p>"What's with all the creepy faces?" Buffy asked as she sat down on Faith's
lap.</p>

<p>"Did you know about them?" Xander asked her, as he looked at  Cordelia
still. "Is everyone here gay now? First them, now you two." He looked at
Willow almost pleadingly. "You're still into Oz right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I love my Oz," Willow said happily.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the answer Xander turned to the girl he had just met. "What
about you?"</p>

<p>Tara seemed to have blushed, and she looked at the gang. "W-what about me?"
she asked trying to avoid the question.</p>

<p>"Do you like girls?" Xander cleared up for her.</p>

<p>"Y-yeah," she admitted shyly and for some reason she expected a bad reaction
from her new friends. Faith just looked at her proudly and Xander threw his
hands up in exasperation.</p>

<p>"I like boys," Anya stated as she clung to Xander's arm.</p>

<p>"Thank God," he muttered before giving her a kiss.</p>

<p>Just then a band took the stage and as quickly as the conversation started
it ended. When the first song began, Cordy grabbed her head in obvious pain
and everyone turned to look at her. Everyone except for Oz, who seemed to be
just as entranced by the singer as she was by him. Willow didn't even
noticed as she worried about her friend, who was seemingly having a vision.
Tara was the only one to notice Oz's distraction and she shook her head
before turning her attention to Cordy.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the ex cheerleader recovered and smiled sheepishly at
the gang. "Looks like I'm going back to LA tomorrow morning," Cordy told
Missy, who was looking at her confused. "I get visions, it kinda has to do
with that whole hellmouth thing," she tried to explain.</p>

<p>"But your not supposed to leave that early," Missy sounded upset as she
looked at Cordelia. She knew the girl was going to have to leave so any sort
of real relationship with her would be impossible for now, but it didn't
mean she wanted to be away from her yet.</p>

<p>"I know, and I don't want to go back either. Well correction, I want to go
back but I want you to come with me. But I know you can't because of school
and all," Cordelia let out a soft sigh. "However, you are coming with me,
school or not," Cordelia pointed to Tara, and everyone looked at her
wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"M-me?" Tara questioned, though she knew that she had to go as well. She
could feel it.</p>

<p>"Look, I saw you. You were there so you have to come back to LA with me. I
don't know exactly what it's all about, but these things are never wrong.
Obviously we need your help with something, so come back with me in the
morning," Cordy more demanded than stated.</p>

<p>Tara nodded slowly and the whole gang seemed confused. They looked at
Cordelia waiting for answers about what she saw and how it involved Tara.
While she explained what she could of it, Willow finally noticed that Oz
still hadn't taken his eyes off the singer of the band on stage. She
suddenly lost interest in what Cordelia was talking about, even though it
involved her new friend, as she felt her boyfriend slipping even farther
away from her.</p>

<p>That night after the gang left the Bronze there seemed to be a black cloud
looming over each of the scoobies, all but Faith and Buffy. Tara had gone
back to her dorm room, already wishing she didn't have to leave her new
friend. Oz had sensed Willow's uneasiness around Veruca, and he spent the
night trying to convince her that she had nothing to worry about, though he
wasn't so sure that it was entirely true. He knew he loved Willow, but there
was still some force larger than himself pulling him to Veruca. Anya even
spent the night trying to bring Xander out of his bad mood by trying to
convince him that not all of the gang was turning gay since she liked
interlocking with him too much for that.</p>

<p>Missy and Cordelia were the only two who made the most of the night by
trying not to feel any sort of sadness. Sure, neither were happy about
having to part right after finding each other, but to look at them no one
would ever know. Buffy and Faith offered to stay at Joyce's again, so the
two of them could have the dorm room to themselves. The night was spent
mostly with Missy watching reruns on the small tv in their room, while
Cordelia lie on her bed next to her, completely engrossed in the magazine
she was reading.  It would've seemed stupid to any other person, for the two
to spend their night hardly paying attention to each other, but it felt
right to both of them.</p>

<p>They weren't in love, and didn't know if they ever would be so there was no
need for over emotional goodbyes and promises that they weren't sure they
could keep. This is what seemed natural to them, almost as if they had sat
around just like this every previous night of their lives. They felt
comfortable around one another, and that was a rare thing for Cordelia.</p>

<p>"You know your face is going to get stuck like that don't you?" Cordelia
asked with a smirk as she looked up at Missy who was staring at the tv
wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Funny, my mom always told me that too. But it only seemed to affect Cliff
since I've still got the perfect face."</p>

<p>"Perfect?" Cordy questioned with a look of disbelief, but then smiled at
Missy to let her know she agreed with the statement.</p>

<p>"So what happens when you leave tomorrow?" Missy questioned as Cordelia put
her magazine on the nightstand next to the bed. Cordelia shrugged as she
moved into Missy's arms.</p>

<p>"I really like you and all, but maybe we should just be friends until we
know each other better. If we meet someone else, we can date them. If we
decide we really wanna be more than friends then we'll figure something
out."</p>

<p>Missy tensed a little bit at that, already jealous of whoever would get to
be with Cordelia besides her, but it was the most reasonable thing she could
think of. They didn't know each other well enough to try a long distance
relationship yet, but maybe one day. Cordelia could feel Missy tense at that
and she kissed her in reassurance. "You'll probably find someone else before
I do," she whispered, and Missy could hear a trace of sadness in her voice.</p>

<p>Missy didn't respond to that, already not liking the direction that the
conversation was going to. She turned off the tv and turned off the lamp
that was by her bed. They laid in each other's arms in the dark for the rest
of the night, both too afraid that if they slept the morning would come too
soon. Sometimes they'd talk and tell stories of their past, some funny, some
sad. They'd make sarcastic, sometimes snide remarks to each other and found
a common bond upon realizing that they could each take it as well as they
could dish it out. In a way it was their own way of showing affection for
each other. It wasn't the most conventional way to go about showing someone
you care for them but it worked for those two.</p>

<p>Sometimes they'd kiss and touch each other for a while before breaking back
off into their comfortable silence. They both wanted to claim the other's
body as their own that night, but both refrained knowing the timing wasn't
right and that it would only make things more complicated when Cordy had to
leave in the morning.</p>

<p>So instead they stayed as they were, ignoring the future, spending every
second enjoying the present. Only time would tell what would happen with
them, but they just met and there was still no need to rush anything. If it
were meant to be, they would end up together in the end after all.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning Oz woke up to find his girlfriend muttering in her sleep
and he smiled as he looked down at her. "Mmm, it's in the sandblaster. Uh,"
Willow said in her sleep.</p>

<p>"What's in the sandblaster Will? It's a dream. Come back to me," Oz said as
he tried to wake her up.</p>

<p>"Willow's smile grew a little.  "Mmm hmmm… All Gemini's to the raspberry
hats," she said, still acting like she was asleep.</p>

<p>"Now you're faking," Oz smiled down at her.</p>

<p>"Am not. Just a little," Willow told him in a cute voice as she turned to
face him.</p>

<p>"Morning."</p>

<p>"Morning," the red head replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Bad dream?" Oz questioned, concerned for her.</p>

<p>"I guess, but the waking up part makes up for it." Willow gave him a kiss
and smiled at him.</p>

<p>"It's always so busy in there," he commented as he held his girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Not always. Some things shut it up completely," Willow told him as she
cuddled even closer to him.</p>

<p>"Anything I can help you with?"</p>

<p>"We gotta go say goodbye to Cordy and Tara now." Willow sighed as she
climbed out of her boyfriend's bed reluctantly. "Are you gonna come?" Oz
nodded silently, suddenly feeling untalkative.</p>

<hr>

<p>The whole gang was now gathered around Cordy's car waiting to see her off.
Everyone was giving their hugs and well wishes, and even Xander hugged her,
however awkwardly. Tara was standing around the group watching them all,
hoping that she wouldn't be gone in LA very long so she could get to know
them together. After a while Xander, Anya and Oz excused themselves. Oz was
the only one with a feasible excuse to leave. He had practice with the
Dingoes early, since when night come he'd be getting a little too hairy.</p>

<p>"Don't let Queen C intimidate you too much," Faith advised Tara while Buffy
said bye to Cordelia. "She likes to pretend she's a bitch but she's nice.
And she's all bark and no bite anyways, unless you ask," Faith said with a
wink.</p>

<p>Tara turned about ten shades redder and opened her mouth, trying to form
words but found it impossible. Willow noticed and walked over to the two,
shooing Faith away with a gentle push. Willow could have sworn she heard
Faith growl playfully at her but she turned her attention to Tara.</p>

<p>"So you're leaving huh?" Willow asked sadly. Tara nodded, feeling the
saddest to leave Willow behind. Not only did she want to stay around and
practice spells with the red head more, but after seeing the way her
boyfriend was eying the singer of Shy, she didn't want to leave her. "You're
coming back aren't you?" Willow questioned sadly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll be back as soon as this whole thing is done. Keep practicing
those spells I told you about too," Tara said with a smile.</p>

<p>Willow nodded, and gave the blonde a hug. "As weird as it is for me to say
this, take Faith's advice and don't let Cordy get to you. She can be mean,
and trust me I know, but under all the layers she's a sweet person."</p>

<p>Just then the two of them noticed Cordelia and Missy walking away from the
group to say their goodbyes. Buffy and Faith took their leave saying they
had to go get the house cleaned up before Joyce got home, and Willow and
Tara kept talking so as to allow the other two their privacy.</p>

<p>"I'm really not the type for emotional goodbye's," Cordelia started as she
took on of Missy's hands in her own. "But I'll miss you."</p>

<p>"I'll miss you too." Missy smiled at her. "So do I get a goodbye kiss or
what?"</p>

<p>Cordelia's eyes went wide and she looked around her. "In public?" she asked
softly.</p>

<p>"It's not like you live here anymore," Missy laughed.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you do," Cordelia replied, but Missy knew Cordy didn't really
care about that. She just liked to be a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>"I do, and I don't care. I want a kiss," Missy said stubbornly causing
Cordelia to laugh. Before Cordelia could say anything else though she felt
Missy's lips pressed softly against hers and she wrapped her arms around
Missy's waist pulling her closer. When the kiss broke they continued the
embrace for a few minutes before Cordy pulled away.</p>

<p>"I've gotta get going now," she informed Missy.</p>

<p>Missy nodded, and gave Cordelia a quick peck on the lips. "Call me when you
get there so I know you got back okay. And be nice to Tara, she's the
sensitive type you know."</p>

<p>"I promise to call, and I'll be as nice as I can be to her. She could use a
little toughening up anyways."</p>

<p>The two walked back towards Cordelia's car and hugged one last time before
Cordy got in. Willow and Tara also exchanged one last hug, and as soon as
Tara was in the car Cordelia drove off, leaving two sad girls behind. "Well
this sucks," Missy said to Willow. The red head only nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Just as they turned around to walk back to campus, Missy spotted an all too
familiar face. "What the hell was that?" the blonde girl yelled at Missy
with wide eyes.</p>

<p>Missy's smile came back, and she grinned from ear to ear. She took hold of
Willow's hand and led her over to the girl. "Long time no see Torr."</p>
