<p>"Again, what the hell was that?" Torrance asked as Missy walked up to her.</p>

<p>"That was my girl going back to LA," Missy said, giving Torrance a 'duh'
look. Missy shook her head; already knowing that was something she picked up
from Cordelia. "Well she's not really my girl yet but maybe one day if we
decide that's what we want."</p>

<p>"What the hell has happened to you since you've come here?" Torrance asked
as the two hugged.</p>

<p>"A lot of stuff you probably wouldn’t believe. This is Willow by the way,"
Missy said as she pointed to the red head that was silently standing by. The
two shook hands and Willow noticed that Missy kept looking around them.</p>

<p>"Where's Cliff?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he stayed back at your parents. I only came up here for the day to see
you," Torrance replied.</p>

<p>"Well don't I feel special then?" Missy asked with a smile as she linked
arms with Torrance.</p>

<p>"You should. It's not everyday that someone has a best friend as perfect as
me." Missy shook her head and Willow laughed at that.</p>

<p>"Hey Willow, what are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"I figured I'd go watch the guys practice. There's nothing else to do around
here," she smiled at them.</p>

<p>"Cool. Mind if we tag along? It'd be the only cool thing in this town I
could actually show Torr."</p>

<p>"You're going to explain that kissing thing to me on the way right? Because
last time I checked-"</p>

<p>"Les was the only gay one. Yeah, I know." Missy paused to laugh. "This is a
strange town Torr. Anything's possible when you're here." With that Willow
let herself get amused as she led the two to the Dingoes practice.</p>

<hr>

<p>While Codelia drove back to LA Tara spent most of the trip lost in thought
about Willow and Oz. She had taken an immediate liking to the red head but
she knew that she was also deeply in love with Oz. "Cordelia?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" she responded in a slightly annoyed voice, unhappy to be brought out
of her thoughts of Missy.</p>

<p>"D-do you know Oz really well?" the shy blonde asked.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Cordy replied as she turned her radio down some. "I guess, I've known
him since high school but we aren't really the closest people in the world.
Why?"</p>

<p>"H-he loves Willow a lot right?" Tara questioned, remembering the way he had
been entranced by Veruca that night at the Bronze.</p>

<p>Cordelia gave Tara a funny look, and then finally smiled at her. "You've got
a crush on Willow don't you?" Tara blushed furiously and nodded slightly not
bothering to lie to Cordelia. "Yeah, he loves her a lot. Even after she
cheated on him he still loved her," Cordelia said sadly remembering when
Willow and Xander had cheated on both of them.</p>

<p>"She cheated on him?" Tara asked, surprised that Willow would ever do
something like that.</p>

<p>"Yeah, with my boyfriend at the time. It wasn't a nice situation. But Oz is
really dedicated to her. But you never know. In a town like Sunnydale,
anything’s capable of happening," Cordelia said with a reassuring smile.
"But first we need to work on this shyness thing of yours."</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy and Faith sat on the blonde's old bed back at her mom's house trying
to throw jelly beans in each other's mouths. "What flavor was that?" Faith
asked excitedly as she managed to get one into Buffy's mouth.</p>

<p>"Why don't you find out?" Buffy asked as she moved closer to Faith. Faith
just grinned at her girlfriend before kissing her deeply. As she slid her
tongue into Buffy's mouth she could taste the popcorn flavored jelly bean.
Faith broke the kiss immediately and wrinkled her nose in distaste. "Those
are the gross ones," she informed Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy let out a small laugh and shook her head at Faith. "Well it's better
than cleaning the place up," she said.</p>

<p>"I suppose, but there's still some things better than this," Faith told
Buffy as she gave the blonde a small kiss. "We haven't had enough alone time
since we got together you know," she smiled seductively at Buffy.</p>

<p>"And just what do you suggest?" Buffy asked as she started placing kisses on
Faith's neck.</p>

<p>"Well I was thinking about a shower first of all," Faith replied as she slid
her fingers under Buffy's chin and lifted the blonde's face to hers. "Then
we could come back here and have some fun," Faith whispered before kissing
the blonde.</p>

<p>After the kiss broke Buffy pulled stood up and smiled at Faith. "Sounds like
a plan," Faith's eyes lit up at her girlfriend’s words and she quickly stood
up as well. "After we clean the place up," Buffy said with a grin.</p>

<p>Faith grumbled slightly in protest as she followed Buffy down the stairs.
"How do you think Missy's doing now that Queen C left?" Buffy let out a
small laugh after Faith said that. "What?" Faith asked defensively.</p>

<p>"Well Missy's the only one you haven't given a nickname to yet. It's just
cute. And now your all like caring and stuff." Buffy teased her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Isn't that how you want me to be?" Faith asked as she raised an eyebrow.
"Besides, she looks like me. So it's like she's kinda me but not or
something really weird like that that I haven't really figured out yet."</p>

<p>Buffy laughed even harder at that as she kissed her girlfriend. "Well I'm
sure Missy's going to be just fine. Cordy too. I always thought Cordy would
get with Angel actually. I really don't see her liking girls, but then I
never thought I would either until I found you." Buffy said giving Faith
another kiss. "Now lets get this cleaning done so we can have that shower."</p>

<hr>

<p>Willow, along with Missy and Torrance, walked into the Bronze finding it
unusually quiet since the Dingoes were supposed to be practicing their set
for their next show. Missy was busy explaining to Torrance that the Bronze
was the only place actually worthwhile to go to in Sunnydale. When the three
got closer to the stage they all noticed the guys were all sitting around,
except for one who was leaning against the wall talking to another girl.</p>

<p>Missy recognized the girl as the one who had been singing there before, and
she noticed that the girl seemed to be just a little too close to Oz for
even her liking. As she looked at Willow she noticed the red head was
thinking the same thing. She kept waiting for Willow to go approach her
boyfriend, but she just stood in her place, watching him instead. Finally
she decided to stop looking at the red head and turned back to Oz.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Torrance asked quietly, noticing the tense state her
friend just got in.</p>

<p>Before anyone could answer however they all saw Veruca as she stepped even
closer to Oz and pressed her lips to his. Willow let out a small gasp, and
when Missy turned her attention back to the red head she noticed that she
was already in tears. Missy cleared her throat rather loudly, getting Oz's
attention and he immediately pushed Veruca away from him.</p>

<p>As soon as he faced Willow the red head turned around and ran out of the
Bronze. He called out to her, and tried to go after her but Missy stopped
him. "Let her go," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to loose her," he said calmly.</p>

<p>"I think you already have," she replied. "Come on Torr, we gotta go find
her." Torrance nodded at her and followed the brunette out of the Bronze,
thinking she had obviously picked a really bad day to come visit her best
friend. Oz stood by helplessly as he watched the two of them leave, sadly
realizing that what Missy said was most likely true. It wasn’t because he
was just kissing someone else, they’d gotten through something like that
before but he knew fully well this was different. Veruca was different.</p>

<p>"I know the reason you brought me here," Tara said quietly as her and
Cordelia walked into the mansion. The ex cheerleaders eyes went wide as she
looked at Tara.</p>

<p>"How do you know? I haven't told you anything yet. Come to think of it, just
why did you come with me and not even ask an explanation?"</p>

<p>"B-because I could tell you needed my h-help. You got confused in Sunnydale,
and you t-think I can help you solve that confusion right?"</p>

<p>"But how do you know what I'm confused about?" Cordelia questioned. She knew
Tara was a more powerful wicca than Willow had told her about, but there's
no way the blonde could be a mind reader.</p>

<p>A small smile formed on Tara's lips that almost freaked Cordelia out. "I
just know that you're confused about two people. One you're in love with,
and one you could possibly be in love with. You want me to give you
answers," Tara replied.</p>

<p>"That's just really weird. How come you're not all shy when you go into
witch mode?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Who's a witch?" another voice asked and Cordelia practically jumped
backwards in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why do you always do that?" she asked in agitated tones. "Can't you just be
normal for a change?"</p>

<p>"I'm a vampire Cordelia. I'm not normal," Angel replied with a small smile.
"And do what?" he replied to her first question.</p>

<p>"You know what I'm talking about," Cordelia chided him. "That creepy popping
up out of nowhere thing all the time."</p>

<p>"You've only known me for how many years now?" he asked. "Shouldn't you be
used to it by now?"</p>

<p>Tara watched the exchange between the two friends and smiled softly to
herself. She knew she hadn't really been needed in LA for anything
important, and she even had an idea that Cordelia never really saw anything
that night at the Bronze. Cordelia had only become confused and Tara knew
that she had just needed someone impartial to help her figure things out. To
talk to about how she was feeling, towards Angel and Missy. It just hadn't
clicked completely in the blonde's mind until they had actually arrived in
LA since she had been so wrapped up with her thoughts on Willow.</p>

<p>Someone new to the group like Tara wouldn't hold their past against them,
and she wouldn't be able to yell at Cordelia for possibly leading Missy on.
Because Tara was new to the group, she would be able to realize that what
Cordelia felt for Missy was real, and did mean a lot to her. But when it
came down to it, any fool could see that she was helplessly in love with the
man standing in front of her.</p>

<p>But now Cordelia was scared. If she had been the same girl she was in high
school it wouldn't have bothered her, but she knew that if Tara could help
her to get with Angel, it meant she'd have to hurt Missy. And that was
almost as bad as sticking a knife in her own heart.</p>

<p>Cordelia finally let out a soft sigh of exasperation and tugged on Tara's
hand, pulling her up the stairs in the mansion leaving Angel behind. She
gave him one last look before he disappeared from her sight and smiled
sadly. Yes, it would hurt her if she hurt Missy, but it would kill her if
she never got a chance with Angel. Besides, Missy deserved someone who
actually lived closer to her and could be more devoted to her. 'Someone like
Willow,' Cordelia thought with a small smile just before her brain went into
overdrive, trying to think of ways Tara could help to get her with Angel.</p>

<hr>

<p>After a while, Torrance had realized that due to what happened to Willow,
she wouldn't be able to spend any time with Missy. She decided to just go
home after making Missy promise that the two would have a long talk after
all this was over. Missy felt horrible for not being able to spend time with
Torrance, but after what just happened to Willow she felt that she should be
more worried about her new friend.</p>

<p>Now the two were sitting in Missy's dorm room and Missy was nervously
waiting for Buffy and Faith to arrive. Missy looked over at Willow, who was
sobbing softly on Buffy's bed and she immediately rushed to Willow's side
and pulled the girl into her arms, trying to fight off her anger at Oz.
Willow curled into her arms and Missy stroked her hair soothingly and smiled
softly to herself remembering Torrance asking her just when she became such
a 'softy' as she had put it. She shook her head ruefully and pushed the
thought back for pondering at another time.</p>

<p>"Hey, it's gonna be okay Willow," Missy said softly as she took the red
head's hand into her own.</p>

<p>Willow shook her head forcefully in an adamant no, and pulled herself away
from Missy so she could look at the brunette. "He's punishing me," she said
sadly.</p>

<p>"For what?" Missy asked. "For being the sweetest girl to ever walk the
earth?"</p>

<p>If Willow weren't so upset about the whole Oz thing, she would've smiled at
Missy's words. "In high school Xander and I kinda, cheated with each other.
He was with Cordy then and Oz and I were together and we cheated because
we're bad evil cheaters and Oz is trying to get back at me for being bad and
evil," Willow said as she started sobbing again.</p>

<p>Missy sighed inwardly and pulled Willow back into her arms. "You're not evil
Willow. If anything, all you are is sweet, fun and loveable okay?" Missy
asked as she kissed the top of Willow's forehead. Missy was about to
continue talking but Buffy and Faith came into the room with wide grins on
their faces, which quickly disappeared when they saw the two girls.</p>

<p>Buffy was immediately at her best friends side upon seeing her sad eyes,
hugging her fiercely while Faith looked at Missy confused. "What happened
Will?" Buffy asked softly as she broke the hug with her best friend and
wiped the tears from her face.</p>

<p>"Oz," Willow sniffled. "He k-kissed that girl and I saw him," she told Buffy
as she tried to hold back the new tears that were forming in her eyes.</p>

<p>"He what?" Faith almost yelled, her hands already forming fists and she
started pacing around the room. "He kissed another girl Red?" Willow only
answered with a nod and Faith's anger rose even more. Buffy pulled Willow
closer to her and started whispering reassurances at her while Missy rose
from the blonde's bed to calm Faith down.</p>

<p>When Missy got closer to Faith and looked into her eyes it reminded her of
looking into a hurricane or something, and all you can do it just wait for
the storm because you know there's going to be trouble. "Faith, you need to
calm down," Missy said softly even though she retained a certain edge to her
voice.</p>

<p>"Calm down? Red's my friend now and look what he's done to her. Full moon or
not, I'm going to find his sorry little wolf ass and kick it back to," Faith
paused for a brief second and turned back to Missy. "To wherever his sorry
little wolf ass came from. No one fucks with the people I care about now."</p>

<p>"I feel the same damn way okay? But Willow still loves him, and that would
only hurt her further Faith. It's not like they haven't gotten through
something like this before. I'm sure they can again. And you have to calm
down before I have to kick your ass," Missy said with a smile. Faith laughed
at that and her anger seemed to have dissipated some.</p>

<p>"Can you take care of her?" Faith asked abruptly as she looked at Willow who
was crying once again in Buffy's arms.</p>

<p>"Of course," Missy replied, not even having to think about the answer as she
raised an eyebrow at Faith curiously. "Why?"</p>

<p>"You never said I couldn't scare the shit out of him, assuming I find him
before he goes all hairy on us. And you know that B won't let me go by
myself so I need to be sure you can take care of Red."</p>

<p>Missy's smile grew as she looked at Faith and went to pat her look alike on
the shoulder. "Why, I think I got that softy side of me from you. 'Cuz I
think you're just about the biggest softy I've ever seen."</p>

<p>Faith looked appalled at the notion of being a softy and scoffed at Missy.
"You try saying that again and you'll see just how soft my fist is," Faith
said teasingly.</p>

<p>"Uh huh," Missy mumbled. "Now go on and get out of here," she whispered.</p>

<p>Faith's grin grew at that as she looked at Missy. "Why, I'd almost think you
wanted some privacy with Red. Over Queen C already?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not over Cordy, but realistically we both know it won't work out
anyways so it's not like I’m holding my breath. She's the only one I want to
be my girl though. But that has nothing to do with this. I never said I
disagreed with your idea about scaring the shit outta Oz for what he did."</p>

<p>Faith just put on her shit-eating grin and walked over to Buffy and Willow.
"Where's he at Red?" Willow just looked up at her blankly as if she didn't
understand the question. "Fuck it, I'll find him." Faith said and she bent
down to give Buffy a quick kiss before turning around to walk out the door.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed and stood up from the bed. She gave Willow's hand a soft
squeeze before walking to the door. "Guess that's my que to make sure she
doesn't go doing anything irrational isn't it?" Buffy asked with a small
smile. Both girls smiled at her in return and she slipped out of her dorm to
find her girlfriend.</p>

<p>Missy sat back down next to Willow, who seemed to finally be calming down.
Taking Willow's hand into her own, she went about trying to think of ways to
get the red head's mind off of her lousy boyfriend.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Well?" Cordelia asked in slightly agitated tones.</p>

<p>"Well what?" Tara replied as she gave Cordy a confused look. Cordelia just
sighed loudly and Tara shook her head in understanding. "I can't just put a
spell on him and b-bam instant love. You just have to tell him how you
f-feel about him," Tara said softly.</p>

<p>Cordelia sat down at her desk and pulled out a nail file. "It's not like I
can just say 'Hey Angel, I'm in love with you but you're just a big oaf who
never notices these things' to him. You're supposed to be here to help me
get him. Not make me get him on my own."</p>

<p>"You have to do this on you're own. Just tell him how you feel, and it'll be
okay," Tara reassured her.</p>

<p>"But I can't tell him I love him," Cordelia whined.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Angel asked as he walked up to the two girls.  He had figured she
had some new boyfriend and he didn't see why she suddenly became shy about
her feelings.</p>

<p>"You have to stop doing that!" Cordelia yelled at Angel as she stood up and
walked out of the room. His eyes went wide as he watched Cordelia walk out.
Angel turned to Tara who just offered him a weak smile.</p>

<p>"Please tell me you know what that was about?"</p>

<p>Tara thought about the question for a second before locking eyes with Angel.
"She was talking about you," she told him softly, deciding that she might as
well help Cordelia out. After all, the sooner the two got together, the
sooner she could go back to Sunnydale.</p>

<p>"What was she saying about me?" Angel asked curiously.</p>

<p>Tara let out a small laugh and finally realized why Cordelia had needed her
help. He was as dense as a rock. "She l-loves you," she informed him.</p>

<p>Finally a look of understanding spread across Angel's face and he smiled at
Tara. "She does?" Tara only nodded in response, and Angel's smile grew.
After another second he quietly excused himself from the room and went to
find Cordelia.</p>

<p>It didn't take him very long to find her, and when he did she tried her best
to ignore him. Finally he decided to just get to the point knowing that it
was the only way she would listen to him. "So what's this I hear about you
loving me?" he asked her softly as he turned her around to face him.</p>

<p>"She told you?" Cordelia asked in surprise. She wasn't sure if she should be
thankful or angry with Tara. Most likely she should be thankful though since
it was the whole reason she had brought the wiccan to LA. Angel brushed a
stray lock of hair behind her ear, and if he had actually had a heartbeat he
was certain it would have been racing at this point. "It's true," Cordelia
whispered softly.</p>

<p>"I think I love you too," Angel replied as he bent down to kiss Cordelia
softly. It was a quick, experimental kiss and when the two broke apart
Codelia smiled at him.</p>

<p>"You think?" she asked as she playfully swatted his arm. She leaned up to
give him another kiss, this time making sure to make it last a little
longer. This time when they broke apart Cordelia turned to walk away from
Angel, but stopped just before she was out of his sight. "What do you think
now?" she asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"I love you," he replied with a smile of his own.</p>

<p>"Good," she stated. "But I've gotta call a friend back in Sunnydale now."
Cordelia told him just before she turned around the corner, out of Angel's
sight. The souled vampire just shook his head, wondering if he'd ever figure
women out.</p>

<hr>

<p>Back in Sunnydale, Buffy finally found Faith roaming the streets of
Sunnydale looking for Oz. She was almost tempted to let her girlfriend go
after Oz, and do as she wanted to him but since it was dark now, it was just
to dangerous. After all, they were vampire slayers, not wolf slayers. Though
the blonde had to admit, they've probably fought worse before.</p>

<p>"Faith," Buffy said softly, getting her girlfriends attention.</p>

<p>"Don't try to stop me B. The guy deserves what I'm going to do to him and
more. You know it as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do know it Faith," Buffy said as she took her girlfriend's hand into
her own. "Will's my best friend and I hate anyone that hurts her. But we
have to let her deal with this. All we can do is make the situation worse."</p>

<p>"But the jerk kissed someone else," Faith practically yelled.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. And it's up to Willow to decide what happens to him, not us,"
Buffy said softly. Buffy wrapped her arms around Faith's neck and pulled her
girlfriend down for a soft kiss. "Come on Faith, let's just go back to the
room?" Buffy questioned with pleading tones in her voice.</p>

<p>Faith relented, pushing her anger aside and kissed Buffy once again. "Only
because I love you," she replied with a smile. Wrapping her arm around
Buffy's waist she let her love lead her back to campus.</p>

<p>Once they got back to the dorm room the first thing they saw was Willow and
Missy cuddled together on the brunette's bed, sleeping soundly. Buffy and
Faith smiled at each other and Buffy went to turn off the small lamp that
was right beside Missy's bed so they wouldn't have the light shining right
in their faces. When she got closer to them, the blonde noticed that Willow
wasn't the only one with tear streaks on her cheeks and she gave Faith a
questioning look.</p>

<p>Faith shrugged, figuring that whatever Willow told her must've just upset
Missy too or something. At least until Buffy checked the messages on the
answering machine, making sure to play them back quietly. That's when they
both heard the message from Cordy, not only telling them that she'd bring
Tara back soon, but that she was now with Angel, that quickly after leaving
Missy behind.</p>

<p>Both slayers wanted to be angry with Cordelia for that, but looking at their
two friends holding each other in the bed next to them, they couldn't help
but think about how cute they looked together. "What do you think will
become of those two?" Buffy asked softly as she felt herself being pulled
down into her bed by Faith.</p>

<p>"I dunno," Faith replied as she kissed Buffy's neck. "But hey, we found our
way to each other. Maybe one day they might too."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy sighed wistfully as she got more comfortable in Faith's arms.
"Besides, nothing brings people better together than pain. I think we've
learned that one for ourselves," Buffy said as she kissed Faith.</p>

<p>"So what now B?"</p>

<p>Buffy's smile grew as she moved out of her girlfriend's embrace. "I take a
shower of course. It's been a long day."</p>

<p>Faith's smile matched her girlfriends as she pulled Buffy back to her. "Can
I come?" she purred into Buffy's ear quietly.</p>

<p>Buffy kissed Faith passionately, and move her mouth closer to Faith's ear
and nibbled on her earlobe softly. "Only if I'm the one making you come,"
she teased right before standing up to gather her shower supplies.</p>

<p>Faith let out a small laugh and smiled to herself. Even though her friend's
lives were an utter mess, for once she was glad she wasn't the one with the
problems. For once, she got to help friends, instead of hurt them. As she
followed Buffy into the shower she knew, it was all because the blonde
standing in front of her loved her that she was doing so well. And now, she
had every intention on thanking the blonde slayer in the best way she knew
how.</p>

<p>The next few weeks went by at a snails pace for the entire Scooby gang.
Faith was still upset that she never got her chance to beat Oz up for what
he did to Willow, but every time she tried Buffy would distract her with
promises of other, much more enjoyable things. Buffy had been spending most
of her time comforting Willow, especially since Oz decided to leave after
what happened. That left Faith to hang out with Missy more, even though it
seemed like Missy was trying to detach herself from the group of friends.</p>

<p>"Why so glum chum?" Faith asked as she walked into the dorm room, which she
now practically lived in. She noticed that Missy was lying on her bed
surrounded by thick textbooks and rolled her eyes. "You've really got to get
over this," she said with an emphatic sigh.</p>

<p>Missy didn't even look up from her books, and continued working as she
replied to Faith. "My parents don't pay for me to come here and fail Faith,"
she said flatly, not caring anymore that her and Faith had similar
conversations everyday lately.</p>

<p>Faith collapsed onto her and Buffy's small bed and stared up at the ceiling
as she spoke. "You know what I mean. All you do is eat, sleep and school
work these days. Hell you hardly eat. Don't make me have to beat some sense
into you."</p>

<p>"Blame Cordy," Missy replied as she set her book down. She knew she hadn't
really been depressed over Cordy, but it was the easiest excuse she could
come up with for being so glum lately. "And like you could," she smiled as
she stared Faith down.</p>

<p>Faith laughed, glad to see the familiar spark back in Missy's eyes. She
smiled in spite of herself, amazed that she was actually being helpful to
someone. It was new to her, not only having friends but wanting to do things
to make them happy, to be there for them. "You know I could. Don't make me
have to prove my point," Faith said with a wicked grin.</p>

<p>Missy walked over to Faith and Buffy's bed and smirked at Faith. "Don't make
me have to prove mine," she said as a challenge, feeling good for the first
time since she had gotten Cordelia's call about her and Angel getting
together. Faith, never being one to back down from anything rose from the
bed and looked Missy in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Just remember, you asked for this," she teased. The two stared at each
other for several seconds, and if any stranger were to see them they'd think
that the two girls were about ready to rip each other's heads off. Suddenly
Faith broke into a wide grin, and tugged on Missy, so she had the girl
trapped in her arms and started tickling her unmercifully. Missy collapsed
to the floor, bringing Faith down with her, as she struggled to breathe
while laughing so hard.</p>

<p>Just as Faith was about to let up, she heard the door opening and smiled as
she saw Buffy walk in. "Hey B, come give me a hand," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes narrowed as she wondered what the two had been doing though she
smiled at the two of them. "You know it's a good thing that I trust the two
of you or I might be wondering what's going on here," she said playfully.</p>

<p>Faith stood up, and offered her hand to Missy to help the other girl up as
well. "I was just cheering her up. 'Bout time don't you think?" Faith asked,
and Buffy didn't fail to notice the proud look in her girlfriend's eyes. She
knew it meant a lot for Faith to help out as a way of making up for all that
she had done in the past.</p>

<p>"So no more black cloud looming over the dorm?" Buffy asked as she walked
over to Faith and allowed herself to be pulled into the brunette's strong
arms.</p>

<p>Missy happily sat down on her bed and shook her head no as she admired the
way Buffy and Faith seemed to fit together, as if they were made for each
other. She sighed to herself, remembering the time when she got to hold
Cordelia like that. As brief as their time together was, it had meant a
great deal to her. But there were other things now. Feelings for another
someone, that she felt she shouldn't be having. That she felt guilty for
having. But Faith was right; it was time to get over it. After all, this was
college and one's supposed to have fun in college.</p>

<p>Buffy turned in Faith's arms and reached up to give her a quick kiss before
smiling sweetly at her. "Since you're so good with the cheering up thing,
why don't you go fix Willow?" Buffy frowned. "I think Oz broke her."</p>

<p>"Sorry B, but you know Red and I aren't that close." Faith paused and kissed
her girlfriend's forehead before turning to look at Missy. "But who could
cheer her up better than someone who knows her pain?"</p>

<p>"And they did look awfully cute cuddled together that one night," Buffy
supplied, unsure of why she actually did it.</p>

<p>Missy's eyes widened as if to give a look that said, 'Who? Me?' to the two
slayers. "Neither of us can do any good so why can't you at least try?"</p>

<p>"I'll pout," Buffy added with a smile as she looked from Missy to Faith.</p>

<p>Faith's grin grew as she looked down at her girlfriend. "Don't make her
pout," Faith warned Missy. "It's impossible to refuse her when she pouts."
Faith gave Buffy a smile before turning her attention to Missy. "Then again,
she looks adorable when she pouts. And since it won't be me she's pouting
at, go ahead and make her pout."</p>

<p>Missy just rolled her eyes at the two as she stood back up. "I'll go, but
don't expect much." Both slayers eyes lit up as they watched Missy walk out
the door. For one, they were glad that she was actually acting human again
and they were both hopeful that she'd be able to cheer Willow up some.</p>

<p>"Think she'll be able to do it?" Buffy asked as she pulled Faith closer to
her. The blonde buried her face in her girlfriend's neck.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I've got other things on my mind now," Faith said
huskily, finally glad to have the blonde alone in their room.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell me about them?" Buffy questioned as she sat down on her
bed, pulling Faith into her lap.</p>

<p>"Never thought you liked the dirty talk B," Faith whispered as she brought
her lips just so they were inches from Buffy's.</p>

<p>"Why don't you find out?" Buffy asked breathlessly just seconds before
kissing her girlfriend passionately.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Willow," Missy smiled at the red head as she opened the door to her
dorm room. "Could we talk for a minute?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, come on in," Willow responded as she moved to the side, allowing
Missy entrance to her room. When Missy walked in she noticed that Tara was
there, along with another girl she didn't recognize. "Oh, that's Amy,"
Willow stated as she noticed the brunette's confusion.</p>

<p>"I was the pet rat," Amy said as she held out her hand to Missy.</p>

<p>Missy accepted it, and shook the girls hand, trying to figure out what was
really going on. "You k-know Willow's a lot more p-powerful when she's
upset," Tara stated softly as she stood from the floor. "We should probably
get you home," Tara said softly, looking at Amy.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that'd probably be a good idea," Amy agreed with the blonde Wicca.
The two said their goodbyes, both giving Willow tight hugs before they left,</p>

<p>"So they sent you over huh?" Willow asked softly as she sat down on her bed,
patting the spot next to her. Missy took the invitation and sat down Indian
style next to Willow.</p>

<p>"Yeah, they figured since we've both been out of it maybe we'd be able to
cheer each other up. I think they just wanted to, you know," Missy said as
she made little motions with her hands, indicating what she was thinking of.
Willow got the picture and turned a few different shades of red. "So you've
been working on the magic thing lately huh?" Missy asked, and Willow was
grateful for the change of subject.</p>

<p>"It gives me something to concentrate on. And when I'm concentrating I can't
think about all the not so good stuff. It helps," Willow supplied.</p>

<p>"I think Tara's got a crush on you," Missy said with a smile as she nudged
Willow. "Have you seen the way she looks at you?"</p>

<p>Willow looked thoughtful for a moment before smiling at Missy. "I think she
looks at everyone like that. I know I saw her looking at Amy like that. But
even if she did like me I wouldn't… Not that there's anything wrong with it
or anything because Buffy and Faith and the you and Cordy thing and that was
all fine and dandy you know? I don't mind that people are or anything and
I'm all for it it's just that if I were…" Willow trailed off, obviously at a
fault for words.  She looked up at Missy hesitantly, hoping the brunette
would get what she was trying to convey without her having to actually speak
the words.</p>

<p>When she felt Missy's lips softly pressing against hers, she tensed for a
second, before relaxing and kissing the brunette back. It was barely more
than just a peck, but that's all they needed now. "I know why you've been
hiding Willow. It's the same reason I have been. I feel guilty about it,
especially since you've been hurting and I'm still hurting a little over
Cordy, but I think about you. About holding you like I did that one night. I
tried avoiding you, wishing it to go away, but it didn't. And I can't really
avoid you forever."</p>

<p>"Its just Oz. Oz was such a big part of everything, of me for so long. And
now he's gone. And I feel like I'm supposed to stay sad longer. But
sometimes I think about you and I can't help it."</p>

<p>"Then maybe we could just go slow?" Missy asked as she took Willow's hand
into her own. Willow nodded in agreement just before Missy captured her lips
for the second time. This kiss was a little longer than the first, but still
short. "Hey, lets go bug Buffy and Faith," Missy said with a wicked smile.</p>

<p>"But I thought they were," Willow paused to make the same motions with her
hands that Missy did earlier while blushing again.</p>

<p>"Exactly my point," Missy replied as she stood up, bringing Willow with her.
The red head just sighed, but followed Missy none the less. At least things
would never get boring for her she thought to herself.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Missy and Willow reached the brunette's dorm room Missy stopped to
knock on the door. As fun as it might be for her to catch Faith and Buffy in
the act just to piss them off, she knew if Willow saw them the girl would
probably loose all cohearant thought for the next few days. When she heard
Faith's angry reply to her knocking she smiled to herself. "It's important
guys. I'm giving you two minutes and then we're coming in." Missy yelled
into the door. When she heard the two slayers grumbling on the other side of
the door she smiled proudly to Willow.</p>

<p>Finally the time was up, and Missy walked into her room holding Willow's
hand in hers. "I think I unbroke her," Missy said playfully as she let go of
Willow's hand and sat down on her bed. Both slayers noticed the red head's
sudden shyness as she sat down next to Missy, and for a moment Buffy thought
she saw a glimpse of the Willow she first met back in 10th grade.</p>

<p>"Okay you two, what's going on?" Faith asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>Much to Willow's relief, the phone rang just then and Buffy answered it
before Missy got to answer the question. It's not that she didn't want her
friends to know what just happened, but didn't slow mean keeping it to
yourself for just a little bit? But then as soon as she felt Missy's hand
slide into her own her fear of her friends reactions dissipated. It wasn't
that she was afraid of telling them she had developed feelings for Missy, it
was just that she thought they might look down on her for trying to move on
from Oz after only a few weeks.</p>

<p>"It's for you," Buffy said as she handed Missy the phone. Missy looked
confused, wondering who would be calling her, and from the look on Buffy's
face she had a good idea of who it might be. She took the phone after
hesitating for a few seconds and took a deep breath before speaking.</p>

<p>"Hello?" she asked, and she wasn't surprised when she heard Cordelia's voice
on the other end of the reciever. "Hey Cordy. What's going on?" Missy asked
softly. She looked over at Willow, who seemed to be a little nervous and she
tightened her hold on the red heads hand just a little, and began to softly
rub her thumb in small circles on the back of her hand in reassurance.</p>

<p>"I figured I'd try to call you. We haven't talked since that message I left
you when I got home. I've left you a lot and you never called back,"
Cordelia said sadly. "I'm sorry," she added almost silently.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry too," Missy said, feeling very awkward about having this
conversation with three people in the room. Especially one she thought to be
her new girlfriend, or something close to. "There's been a lot of stuff to
think about you know? It hurt but I've dealt." She paused and looked from
Willow to the two slayers on the other bed. "I've found someone myself," she
said with a smile.</p>

<p>Willow blushed slightly as Missy said that, feeling almost proud that Missy
told Cordelia about that when she knew the brunette still had some feelings
for the ex cheerleader. She didn't even know if she'd be able to tell Oz
something like that so soon, assuming she ever talked to him.</p>

<p>"It's Willow isn't it?" Cordelia asked, and a little of her guilt floated
away.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's her. She's kinda here now though so I can't really talk long.
But let me say one thing first okay?" She stopped for a minute, and could
almost see Cordelia nodding her head even though she wasn't speaking. "If he
ever hurts you, big scary vampire or not, I'll beat the shit out of him."</p>

<p>All three girls in the room with her laughed, along with Cordelia who was on
the other end of the line. "Fine, if he does that I promise not to stop you
from staking him okay?" Cordelia asked happily.</p>

<p>"Hey I heard that," Missy heard what she assumed to be Angel chuckling in
the background and it caused her to laugh too.</p>

<p>"So we can still be friends?" Cordelia asked quietly, still feeling
uncomfortable about showing she actually cared.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to pull a you here and say 'Duh'?" Missy asked jokingly. "Of
course we can be friends." Missy smiled, glad to be having this conversation
so she could put her weekend with Cordy behind her and truely focus on what
she was feeling for Willow.</p>

<p>"Okay, good," Cordelia said, and Missy could tell she was satisfied with the
answer. "I'm gonna go pout at Angel to take me shopping now," Cordelia said.
"Tell Willow to take care of you okay?"</p>

<p>"Will do. Take care," Missy said. The two finished their goodbyes, and as
soon as Missy hung the phone up she noticed two sets of slayer eyes watching
her intently. "What?" she asked innocently.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Faith smirked as she looked at Missy. "What's up with
you two."</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Missy replied, matching Faith's smirks with one of her
own. "I know your not the brightest crayon in the box, but it doesn't take a
brain surgeon." Willow blushed again at that, and Buffy studied her best
friend. It didn't take the blonde long to figure out that whatever Willow
was feeling for Missy, it was growing fast, which was clearly shown by the
ammount of her blushing.</p>

<p>"Hey, you remember what  I did to you ealier?" Faith asked, trying to
actually sound threatening. "Don't make me have to embarass you in front of
Red like that."</p>

<p>Missy rolled her eyes as she stood up, and offered her hand to Willow. "You
don't scare me," she said playfully. She then turned her attention back to
Willow and gave her a sheepish smile. "You wanna maybe go out or something?"
she asked softly, slightly embarassed to be doing this in front of her two
roomates.</p>

<p>"Like a date?" Willow asked, just as shyly. Missy nodded, wondering when it
was that she became shy as she smiled at Willow. "Sure," Willow said as she
stood up from Missy's bed.</p>

<p>"Well aren't you two cute," Faith teased. Buffy swatted her in the arm and
looked at her two friends.</p>

<p>"Ignore her. She's just uhh.. What are you?" Buffy asked as she looked at
her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"I Faith. You Buffy," the brunette replied jokingly. All four of them burst
into laughter at that and when they finally calmed down Missy and Willow
excused themselves and set off for their first date.</p>

<p>Faith laid back in the bed, and Buffy wasted no time in making heself
comfortable in her girlfriend's arms. "Whatcha thinking about?" Faith asked
as she noticed the far away look on the blondes face.</p>

<p>"Just trying to figure Missy out," Buffy replied as she let her fingers
trace patters on Faith's stomach.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Faith asked as she watched Buffy's fingers on her
stomach intently.</p>

<p>"Just look at all she's done for the gang. And without even knowing it,"
Buffy paused, trying to find a way to put her thoughts into words. "She
showed up, and I thought she was you. I probably would have never talked to
you again if it weren't for her. And now look at what we have. This great
incredible thing that would have probably happened if it weren't for her.
And then she gets Willow to forgive you. I think even in that brief thing
she had with Cordelia, she did some good for her. It's like she just comes
into peoples lives and makes them better without even knowing it."</p>

<p>Faith smiled, knowing that there was a lot of truth to Buffy's words. Missy
had came into all of their lives, turned things upside down and made them
better. "Yeah, you're right," Faith said as she kissed the top of Buffy's
head. "But I'd like to believe we would have found each other on our own
eventually anyways."</p>

<p>"Me too," Buffy replied softly. "How do you think her and Willow will do?"</p>

<p>"I think they'll be fine," Faith told her girlfriend. "I think for both of
them, when they go into something they give it their all. I think everything
will be just fine from now on," Faith whispered, almost as if she were
trying to convince herself of that.</p>

<p>"You know I love you right?" Buffy questioned as she propped herself up to
look at Faith.</p>

<p>Faith nodded, and gave the blonde a soft kiss. "I love you too. And remind
me to thank Missy some time for all she's done."</p>

<p>"Okay. But first, I'd rather thank you," Buffy said seductively.</p>

<p>"For what?" Faith asked, hardly able to think as she felt Buffy's hands
start to roam over her body.</p>

<p>"For loving me," Buffy replied as she dipped down to give Faith a tender
kiss. When she pulled away she smiled at the dazed look Faith had on her
face. "Now what do you say we make up for that interruption before?" Buffy
didn't even wait for Faith's response and began trailing kisses along
Faith's jawline.</p>

<p>"Sounds like the perfect ending to the night," Faith finally managed to get
out.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped her minstrations and looked into Faith's eyes. "The perfect
ending. I like the sound of that," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Me too B. And I think we may just get one." Faith reached over and shut of
the lamp beside the bed just before pulling Buffy back into her arms with
every intention of showing the blonde just how perfect all of this really
was.</p>
