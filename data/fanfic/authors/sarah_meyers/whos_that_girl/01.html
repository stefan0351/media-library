<p>They day started out normal enough as two best friends casually walked
around the campus of their new school avoiding meeting their new roomates
for as long as possible. "I really can't believe we don't get to share a
dorm room Will. That's so unfair." Buffy sighed as she carelessly tossed the
key to her new dorm room in the air over and over again.</p>

<p>"It can't be that bad, can it? Or what if my roomate doesn't like me? Or
what if she snores really loud and keeps me up at night?" Willow asked in a
panicy voice and Buffy grabbed her hand to stop her.</p>

<p>"Your right, it won't be bad Wills. I just always thought it would be neat
to kind of live with you," Buffy said with a smile. "I guess we should go
check out our rooms huh?" Willow nodded and Buffy linked arms with her
friend and led the way.</p>

<p>After a few minutes they arrived at the hall where the dorms were and Buffy
walked Willow to her room before heading off to find her own. When she saw
that her room was only a few rooms down the hall from Willow's she smiled to
herself.  She slowly entered the room and was relieved when she found that
her roomate hadn't arrived yet. After tossing her small duffel bag on the
floor between the two small beds Buffy took a moment to walk around the room
and give it furter inspection. "Well this is boring," Buffy spoke to herself
as she layed on one of the beds to wait for her roomate to arrive.</p>

<hr>

<p>"So tell me again just why you chose to come to this school when you could
have gotten into way better schools and continued cheerleading?" Les asked
as he pulled another of his friends suitcases from the back of his car.</p>

<p>"I wanted to get away from the city and just be somewhere relaxing. This is
a cute little town. Besides, I'm not a real cheerleader anyways. I was just
helping out last year to save your butts," Missy said with a smile as she
picked up her bags.</p>

<p>"Let me help you with that stuff. I'll walk you to your room," Les offered
but as he went to reach for one of her bags Missy swatted his hand away.</p>

<p>"You've got to get going though. Your flight leaves tonight and you've
still got to get home and get your stuff together. I'll be fine Les," Missy
gave him a hug and shooed him back into his car. "Besides, I can get one of
those cute guys over there to help me out if I need it," Missy smirked at
her friend who turned his attention to the group of guys she had been
looking at. When she saw the smile grow on Les' face she reached in the car
and covered his eyes. "These are my cute guys, you go find your own
somewhere else."</p>

<p>Les let out a small laugh and gave her hand a soft squeeze. "I'll give you
a call when I get settled in at school," he said. "So since you've got
everything you need I guess I'll get out of here now. Take care of
yourself."</p>

<p>Missy leaned down into the car and gave him a kiss on the cheek. "Sure
thing," she said softly as she closed his car door.  She walked back to
where her bags were and gathered them up in her arms clumsily as she watched
her friend drive off. Once she spotted where the dorm rooms were she made
her way to the room quickly and set her stuff down when she stood outside of
her room. Her arms felt weak from carrying all her bags by herself and after
fumbling around in her pockets for a minute she found the key to her room
and walked in dragging her belongings behind her.</p>

<p>The first thing she noticed was a blonde girl sleeping on one of the beds
and smiled. At least her roomate looked normal enough. Making sure not to
wake the girl yet she quietly put her things on the other side of the room
and sat down on the other bed debating if she should wake the girl up or
not.</p>

<p>Finally she decided she would wake her up since she was starting to get
bored of just watching her sleep. She got up to walk over the the bed and
gently tapped the girl on the shoulder. "Wake up roomie," she said as she
kept nudging the girl. Finally the girl opened her eyes sleepily and Missy
noticed her face pale. "Faith?" The girl asked and Missy just looked at her
curiously.</p>

<p>Before she even knew what was happening Missy found herself pinned
underneath a very pissed off blonde. "What the hell are you doing?" she
yelled at her roomate.</p>

<p>"Me? What the hell do you want Faith?" Buffy asked, now fully awake.</p>

<p>"Who the hell is Faith? I'm Missy, your roomate." Buffy continued to stare
down at her for a minute not believing her but finally she relented and got
up off the bed.</p>

<p>"Your Missy, not Faith?" Buffy questioned, suddenly very confused.</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Oh God," Buffy whispered softly as she started to wonder how this girl
could look exactly like her once friend. "Can we maybe try this again? I'm
Buffy by the way," she said as she held out her hand to her new roomate.
Missy shook her hand and gave her a confused look.</p>

<p>"Nice to meet you Buffy. Now do you mind telling me what the hell that was
all about?" Missy asked. Buffy nodded and sat back down on the bed next to
the girl. 'This is going to be a long year,' she silently thought to
herself.</p>

<p>"I know you'll probably think I'm really weird when I finish telling you
about this, at least if you don't already think I am, but please be patient
with me here okay?" Buffy asked as she moved to sit on the other bed in the
small dorm room.</p>

<p>"Okay," Missy replied as she looked at Buffy curiously. She was starting to
wish Les had walked her to her room so when she told him about her wacky
roomie he would believe her.</p>

<p>"Since we're going to be sharing a room for the next year, there are a few
things I need to explain to you. Normally I don't just go telling people
about this stuff but everyone in Sunnydale pretty much already knows anyways
even though they like to pretend they don't. I'm just too tired of trying to
hide it from people and since you'll come to just think I'm really weird
anyways I might as well tell you everything since I have to explain about
Faith."</p>

<p>Missy nodded her head at Buffy and realized how much she missed her nice,
normal friends back at RCH. 'Even Courtney and Whitney who I could hardly
stand when they weren't cheering seem like more fun to be around than this
Buffy girl,' she thought As soon as she heard Buffy talking again she
snapped out of her thoughts and listened to her.</p>

<p>"You know what? You're not going to believe what I say anyways so how about
I just give you the really short version and show you tonight?" Buffy asked,
and sighed when she saw the way Missy was looking at her.</p>

<p>"Just tell me who this Faith person is so I can know why you looked like
you were ready to kill me," Missy said softly, trying to hide the annoyance
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Only if you agree to go out with me and my friends tonight so I can
explain the rest later," Buffy stated.</p>

<p>"Sure, whatever. Just tell me already," Missy replied already getting
frustrated with this conversation and her new roommate.</p>

<p>Buffy gave her a small smile and went on to tell her about Faith, leaving
all vampire and demon parts of the story out. "She was basically a girl I
knew in high school last year. I thought we were becoming pretty good
friends but then she decided she wanted to make my life hell and she ended
up in a coma right before I graduated," Buffy said quietly as she allowed
herself to think about Faith for the first time in a very long time. "You
look just like her and when I woke up and saw you I thought it was her. I'm
really sorry about that Missy."</p>

<p>"It's okay I guess. I don't see how I can look so much like her though. I
mean it's not like we're twins or anything." Missy got up from the bed and
walked over to where her bags were laying on the floor. "So what side of the
room do you want?" Missy asked, hoping to leave that weird conversation
behind.</p>

<p>"I was hoping I could have the left," Buffy said as she rumaged through the
small duffel bag she had with her. She still had all of her things at her
mother's house and only brought enough things to last her the night and a
few small photo's of her friends and other knick nacks so she could at least
make the room start to feel like home.</p>

<p>Making sure to leave Mr. Pointy in the bag she dumped it's contents out
onto her bed and sat down next to the items to sort them out. As she started
placing the pictures of her and her friends on the small night stand beside
her bed she came across the small framed picture of Faith that she had
brought with her. After graduation she went back to the appartment and
stumbled upon it, and decided to keep it.</p>

<p>While she knew Faith had hurt her very much, she also knew it was Faith
that saved them at graduation in the dream the two shared so it was hard to
hold a grudge on her. She was still angry and hurt by it all but she also
still felt guilty for being the one to put Faith in a coma, and missed the
friend that she once had in Faith. "Hey Missy," Buffy called out as she
turned to look at her roommate who was unpacking. Missy stopped and turned
her attention to Buffy and noticed the girl was holding something in her
hands.</p>

<p>Buffy handed the picture to Missy and smiled softly when Missy went wide
eyed. "That's Faith," Buffy stated. "Now you can see why I thought you were
her right? Minus the dark make up and the leather, you two are practically
carbon copies of each other."</p>

<p>Missy just nodded as she continued to look at the picture for another
minute wondering how they could look so alike and not even be related.  She
finally gave the picture back to Buffy who neatly placed it on the night
stand next to her other pictures. "So do I really have to go out with you
and your friends tonight? Not to sound like a major bitch but it's been a
long day for me and I really don't feel like it," Missy said.</p>

<p>"It would be kinda better for you if you came tonight. Now that you know
how much you look like Faith, it would be really bad if my friends saw you
thinking you were her. I don't think you'd be able to convince them as
easily as me that your not her and they'll have pretty much the same
reaction to you that I did."</p>

<p>"Great, so your taking me out to get beat up on my first night in this
town. What a wacky place," Missy mumbled quietly not knowing that since
Buffy was a slayer she could hear what was just said. "So how come you
believed me so easily when I said I wasn't her?"</p>

<p>Buffy watched Missy for a few seconds as she unpacked trying to come up
with the answer to her question, wondering how much she should really tell
her new roommate. "For one, Faith would never be caught dead in those
clothes," Buffy said finally, not failing to notice the glare Missy shot at
her. "Not that there's anything wrong with your clothes. It's just that
Faith has this weird thing for leather. Besides, she's still in a coma and I
don't see how if she woke up she could suddenly be in my dorm room." Buffy
hoped that would be enough to satisfy the girl since she really didn't want
to list all the reasons she knew it wasn't Faith.</p>

<p>The most predominant of those reasons being that Buffy could always feel
when Faith was around because of their slayer connection. It was like the
same feeling she got around vampires, only more warm and fuzzy. Then there
were the less important ones like the fact that if it were Faith, she could
have easily gotten Buffy off of her. Not to mention that Buffy could tell
the difference in their eyes. Even though they were the same color, Faith
always looked at Buffy like she could see right into her very soul and Missy
hadn't looked at her like that.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed softly and Missy sat down on her new bed and looked at her.
"You miss Faith don't you?" she asked noticing the pained expression on
Buffy's face.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Buffy answered with a soft tone. "She really messed up my
life in so many ways. She hurt so many people I care about but before all
that we were starting to get really close. She was like a sister to me
almost, and it's hard to stay mad at her even though I feel like I should."</p>

<p>Missy watched Buffy's face and saw the pain and hurt in her eyes and knew
there was a lot more to this girl than met the eye. Knowing that the subject
of Faith was obviously hard on her new roomie Missy changed the subject.
"I'm going to give my idiot brother a call and let him know I finally got
here and then we can go out like you wanted," Missy said lightly.</p>

<p>"Okay," Buffy replied as she pushed away her thoughts for the moment. She
knew tonight would be a very long night and she wanted to enjoy the quiet
while she could. "I'm going to go for a walk to clear my head a little so
you can have some privacy on the phone. I'll be back in a little bit." Buffy
moved off her bed and gave Missy a smile as she walked out of the room.</p>

<p>At first she thought about going to Willow's dorm room and telling her
about Missy so she would be prepared for it but then she decided it would be
easier to tell everyone at once so she wouldn't have to explain things a
million times. As she walked past Willow's room she wondered just how she
would go about telling the gang that just because Missy looked like Faith,
it wasn't really Faith. Sure the coma thing would be able to sort the issue
out pretty quick had Faith not been a slayer, and also if any of them had
actually bothered to keep tabs on the rogue slayer. Truth was, no one really
stopped to think about Faith after graduation which was almost sad. Suddenly
Buffy realized just how much she did miss her friend Faith, and how much she
hoped that the brunette would wake up so they could make amends.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey perv, it's me," Missy said into the telephone. "I guess you and Torr
are out somewhere but I just wanted to let you know I got to school and
everything. Have a good trip to Kentucky tommorow and tell Torr I said hi
and that I hope she manages to find a real boyfriend someday," Missy said
jokingly to her brothers answering machine. "I would tell you to give me a
call back but I'm going out with my new roommate tonight. At first I thought
she was about as annoying and stupid as those football jocks from school
were but she's turning out to be quite a mystery and I'm looking forward to
figuring it out. Talk to you later," Missy said just before hanging up the
phone.</p>

<p>Missy began to look through her clothes so she could pick out what to wear
later. At the same time she was wondering why she was suddenly so curious
about her new roommates past, and what she was all about. The only thing she
knew for sure was that when they talked about Faith, Buffy had the same
sadness that she had seen when Cliff found out that Torrance had a boyfriend
after regionals. She knew it could only mean one thing, and even though she
didn't know Buffy at all yet, she wanted more than anything to find a way to
make that sadness go away even if she was the only one who knew the real
reason it was there.</p>

<p>"What?" Missy asked as she noticed the way her roommate was looking at her.
Even though she didn't know the whole story about Faith, or really anything
about Buffy at all she had already determined that she'd help the blonde
realize why Faith's betrayal had hurt her so much.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," Buffy said as she blushed a little. "It's just that you
look so much like her. It'll take some time to get used to is all." Buffy
noticed Missy's thoughtful expression and looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Tell me again why I have to wear this?" Missy asked as she grabbed onto
the cross that Buffy told her to wear before they left their dorm room. She
decided that since her and Buffy had just met, prying about Faith wasn't
something she should do yet.</p>

<p>"Just humor me for a few hours," Buffy said as she walked into the Bronze
with her new roommate. "You'll see why later," she then added. "Now
remember, my friends are going to freak out when they see you so just be
patient while I explain to them okay?"</p>

<p>"Okay," Missy responded as she looked around the Bronze, wondering if this
was the only place to hang out at in this small town. Its crowd was a
mixture of mostly older high school and younger college students. Before
Missy had a chance to finish her thoughts she felt Buffy tugging on her arm,
leading her to one of the tables on the opposite side of the Bronze.</p>

<p>The two approached the table where Willow, Oz, and Xander were sitting.
Xander was talking with an excited look on his face, most likely about the
cross country trip he had just returned from, and Oz was looking at him with
his expression of indifference on his face though he seemed to be into what
Xander was saying since none of them noticed the arrival of Buffy and her
new roommate.</p>

<p>"Hey guys," Buffy said getting her friends attention as she grabbed Missy's
hand and stood in front of the slightly taller girl.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffster, how've you…" Xander's words fell silent as he got up to hug
Buffy and noticed the girl that was standing behind her. Oz and Willow
turned their attention to the brunette standing behind Buffy as well, and
Willow paled upon seeing her.</p>

<p>"This is interesting," Oz said nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Guys, I want you to meet someone," Buffy started.</p>

<p>"I think we've already met her, and last time I checked it wasn't a very
enjoyable experience," Willow said softly, squeezing Oz's hand a little
tighter.</p>

<p>"Listen for a minute, this isn't Faith. Her name is Missy, and she's my new
roommate."</p>

<p>Everyone stared intently at Missy, who was just smiling weakly at them
still wondering just how this town got to be so damn weird. "Okay, and just
what did you hit your head on while I was gone Buffy? Hello, psycho girl is
standing behind you and your telling me her name is Missy?" Xander asked.
Willow kept staring at Missy, afraid she would try to attack at any moment
while Oz just sat by quietly waiting for his chance to speak up. He would
have mentioned that Missy had a different smell than Faith, but she wasn't
sure how the new girl would react for finding out about the other half of
him.</p>

<p>Missy sighed and decided on the quickest way to end this so she reached for
her wallet. "Look, it says Missy Pantone, not Faith whatever," she said as
she pointed to her driver's license.</p>

<p>"People can have those made for them," Willow said still not believing that
this wasn't actually Faith.</p>

<p>"Well look at her clothes," Buffy said as she received another glare from
Missy. "We all know Faith wouldn't ever show her face in public with
something like this on."</p>

<p>"Normally no, but after you put her in a coma she'd probably do anything to
get back at us," Xander stated.</p>

<p>"She smells different than Faith. It's not her," Oz said finally as he
noticed how frustrated Missy was looking.</p>

<p>"Wait, back up a second," Missy said as she turned to Buffy. "You’re the
one who put Faith in a coma?" Missy looked at Buffy, and suddenly everything
she thought she started figure out about the girl made no sense again. "And
what the hell is this about you sniffing me?"</p>

<p>"He's part werewolf," Willow stated, unsure of why she was actually talking
to what she believed was Faith.</p>

<p>Missy raised an eyebrow in question after Willow spoke. "Look, you all are
just way too wacky." She reached for the cross Buffy gave her and took the
necklace off her neck. "I tried humoring you Buffy, but this is just
unbelievable. From what you told me earlier, I'm sure you had your reasons
for putting Faith into a coma, but this werewolf stuff is just kind of nuts.
I'm outta here."</p>

<p>The Scooby gang watched in silence as Missy walked out of the Bronze.
"Listen guys, it's not Faith. You have to trust me here. Even Oz said it
wasn't her."</p>

<p>"How do you know for sure Buff? Oz could be wrong," Xander said. "No
offense or anything man," he added as he looked at Oz.</p>

<p>"None taken," Oz replied, sounding like he could care less about the whole
thing.</p>

<p>"I just know. It's kind of a slayer thing," Buffy told them. She winced
when she remembered the last time she spoke those words to her two best
friends. "I gotta go, I'll see you all later."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Where do you think? Missy's out there and some vamp's going to think it's
Faith and kill her! I can't let that happen."</p>

<p>"You're that sure that it's not Faith?" Willow questioned as she finally
started to believe what Buffy was telling her. Buffy nodded and Willow
noticed the sadness and urgency in Buffy's eyes. It was almost as if even
though Missy wasn't Faith, Buffy wanted to save her like she couldn't save
Faith. Since Missy looked just like Faith if Buffy was able to help her
maybe it would help Buffy feel a little less guilty about not being able to
save the other slayer in the past. "Good luck finding her," Willow said
softly.</p>

<p>The blonde gave her a weak smile before sprinting out of the Bronze. She
started running in the direction of the campus, hoping that it was the way
Missy had gone after leaving the group behind. All she could do was hope
that she found Missy before anything happened to her.</p>

<hr>

<p>'Just great,' Missy thought to herself. 'This is your first day in town and
you've gotten yourself a room with a wacko who tried to kill the girl she
doesn't even realize she's in love with. Now if only I knew what was up with
this werewolf crap they're talking about. They are some nutty people.'</p>

<p>Missy stopped as she reached the next block and realized she had forgotten
her way back to campus. She saw two guys walking down the street and
approached them so she could ask which way the campus was. "Well look what
we have here, a lost slayer."</p>

<p>"Slayer?" Missy asked the guy, who looked like he was probably a few years
older than her.</p>

<p>"And all this time we thought you were living it up as a vegetable,"
another male said, ignoring her obvious question. "Guess that your dear
friend Buffy didn't stick that knife in far enough."</p>

<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Missy asked getting very freaked out
by this new town she had come too. She started to wish she had chose to go
to the same college as Les. Missy tried to walk away from the two, but one
of the men grabbed her arm and as she turned around she noticed that his
face changed.</p>

<p>"I've always wanted to taste the slayer's blood." The vampire pushed Missy
onto the ground and brushed her hair away from her neck. When Missy saw the
vampire's sharp fangs she realized why Buffy had insisted on her wearing the
cross necklace. She began to berate herself silently as she lay helpless
underneath the strong grasp of the vampire. She didn't know why, but she had
the feeling that Buffy would be the only one who was able to help her now.</p>

<p>"You know, since your so gung ho about tasting a slayers blood, you might
want to try finding a real slayer," Buffy said as she walked up to the
vampire that was pinning Missy down. The other vampire that was with him
quickly ran away upon seeing Buffy knowing full well that two slayers would
be too much for him and his friend to handle. The vampire that remained
growled at her but paid no more attention to her. Just as the vamp began to
lower his mouth to Missy, Buffy kicked him in the ribs, which sent him
flying a few feet back. Buffy glanced at Missy quickly to make sure she was
okay and threw that necklace to her. "Put it on," she instructed. "And don't
take it off this time."</p>

<p>While she was talking to Missy the vampire managed to sneak up behind her
and throw her on the ground. Buffy quickly swept his feet out from under him
and before she was even all the way back on her feet Mr. Pointy was firmly
placed into the vamp's heart. "Poof he goes," Buffy said with a small smile.
  She walked over to Missy and helped her stand. "You okay?" Buffy asked as
she looked over Missy for any wounds.</p>

<p>Missy was still trying to register what she had just seen.  Her body was
shaking slightly from either the cool night air, or just becoming that close
to being vampire chow and Buffy noticed. The blonde pulled her roommate into
a hug in an attempt to help her calm down a little bit. "You're going to
explain this to me right?" Missy asked softly as she let Buffy embrace her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I will." Buffy let go of Missy and felt a pain rising in the pit of
her stomach as she looked the girl over. She knew Missy wasn't Faith but
just because they looked so much alike she couldn't help but feel more
attached to Missy than she probably should. "You know what that was right?"
Buffy asked as she started leading the way back to school. Missy nodded, and
as they passed a few more people walking down the street she moved closer to
Buffy afraid that any of these people could be vampires. Buffy noticed this,
and took the taller girl's hand into her own to offer support.</p>

<p>"Well there are a lot of vampires and other such demons in Sunnydale. I once
thought that they were make believe too, but unfortunately they are real.
I'm what's called the 'slayer' and my job is to kill them and stop all their
end of the world type plans."</p>

<p>"Faith was a slayer too right?" Missy asked when she remembered what the
vampires said to her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she was called after…" Buffy's voice trailed off and she turned her
attention away from Missy. After a few moments of silence she began to speak
again. "There can only be one slayer at a time, or at least that's how it's
supposed to work. The new one is called after the previous one dies. I died
for a few minutes, and then Xander revived me. Kendra was still called
however, but then she died and Faith was called. A little much huh?"</p>

<p>"I guess. Of course, if your telling me demons and vampires exist, that
means Torr might have been right about her spirit stick curse," Missy said
with a laugh. Now that she had calmed down a bit from her scare with the
vampire Missy finally realized Buffy was holding her hand still, but didn't
say anything about it.</p>

<p>"Spirit stick curse?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Last year I transferred to a new school because my family moved. I was a
gymnast but the school I had to go to didn't have a team so I became a
cheerleader. Torrance, my best friend became captain that year and
everything went wrong and she said it was all because of the spirit stick
curse."</p>

<p>"Oh," Buffy said, sounding a little confused.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy, how come you put Faith in a coma?" Missy asked out of the blue
and Buffy looked at her with uncertainty. "I know we just met a few hours
ago, and I'm not trying to pry into your life or anything I was just kind of
curious."</p>

<p>Buffy let go of Missy's hand and started walking up the stairs to their dorm
room with the brunette following behind her. She didn't say anything to
Missy, but instead got lost in thought for the next few minutes. She wasn't
sure why, but she really wanted to tell Missy everything about what
happened. Maybe it was partly because she looked so much like Faith, but
mostly just because she knew even though she wanted to she couldn't talk to
the Scooby gang about this. They still hated Faith too much, despite the
fact that it was Faith who saved them all at graduation by telling Buffy
about the mayor still having his human weakness. It would be nice to have
someone neutral to talk to, to confide in and just to be friends with.</p>

<p>As the two walked into their dorm room Buffy sat down on her bed and picked
the small picture of Faith up off her night stand. "You really want to know
the whole story?" she asked Missy.</p>

<p>Missy nodded as she sat down on her bed and started pulling off her shoes.
"You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want. It's not like we've
really known each other that long or anything."</p>

<p>"I kind of want to tell you," Buffy said. "I haven't been able to talk to
anyone about any of this and it'd be kind of nice to be able to say what I
really think without being afraid of my friends getting mad at me."</p>

<p>"Why would they be mad?" Missy asked as she lay on her bed.</p>

<p>"Because they hate Faith still, but I can't seem to stay mad at her for the
stuff she did. I always felt so free around her. It was like she was a
sister or something to me. But then one night when we were out slaying, she
accidentally killed a human." Buffy continued her story, telling Missy about
Faith joining the mayor, trying to kill angel and the only cure to the
poison she shot in him being a slayers blood. Then she explained about her
and Faith's shared dream from when the two were both in the hospital and how
she stopped the mayor at graduation.</p>

<p>When she finished her story she noticed Missy was just looking at her wide
eyed, obviously having a little bit of trouble believing the whole story. "I
umm… Geez, what do I even say to that?" Missy asked.</p>

<p>"You could tell me you believe me and don't think I'm freak of the month?"
Buffy offered with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well yeah, I believe you. I'd be kind of silly not to considering what
happened to me tonight. Torr is going to flip when I tell her there actually
is something in the world more evil than Big Red."</p>

<p>"Big Red?" Buffy asked as she lay down on her bed.</p>

<p>"She was the captain of the cheerleading team before Torrance. When I
transferred to that school Torr was already captain, but Big Red had stolen
another school's cheers and it just caused a lot of trouble for all of us.
She liked to make people's lives hell from what I hear. Hey! Since you fight
evil why don't you go kill her?" Missy asked jokingly.</p>

<p>Buffy laughed at that, before she realized something. "Did she have red
hair?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" was Missy's only response.</p>

<p>"This Big Red person, did she get that nickname because she had red hair?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess. Why?" Missy questioned as she tried to not get confused over
this.</p>

<p>"Well Faith used to call Willow 'Red' because of her hair color. Just made
me think of her I guess." Buffy said quietly.</p>

<p>"You should go see her," Missy said as she pulled some of her night clothes
from her dresser. "I think it would help you to go talk to her, even if she
can't respond. It'd be a way for you to get everything off your chest
without worrying what she'll say or do. Then when she wakes up from her
coma, maybe you two would be able to work things out and be friends again."</p>

<p>"I don't think we could. She'll probably just push me away again. There's so
much between us that I don't think we could ever mend our friendship."</p>

<p>"Don't give me that crap. I'll give you the same advice I once gave my
brother, be aggressive. If she tries to push you away, don't let her. Got
him the girl, it'll get you yours too. Guaranteed." Buffy gave Missy a
curious look after she said that, wondering what she meant about getting the
girl but Missy only shrugged and climbed under the covers of her bed.</p>

<p>Buffy threw on her night clothes and climbed into her bed, wondering why
Missy was so intent on getting her to talk to Faith. She shut of the small
lamp in between the two beds and lay in the dark hoping that Missy would be
right. Hoping that just maybe, it wasn't too late for her and Faith to try
and start their friendship over again.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Missy," Buffy said as she got out of bed.</p>

<p>"Who the hell is Missy?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her roommate intently, wondering what was going on. "Faith?"
Buffy asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>"The one and only," Faith said sitting down at the end of Buffy's bed. "Miss
me?"</p>

<p>"How?" Buffy questioned, unable to find any other words.</p>

<p>"Dunno B. It's your head we're in, not mine."</p>

<p>"So then it's a dream?" Buffy asked and Faith nodded.</p>

<p>"I'm still in coma land, so it's gotta be a dream." Faith sprawled out on
Buffy's bed and smiled at her. "Is this like one of those slayer dreams or
something? Because normally when I dream about you, you're kicking my ass."</p>

<p>"You dream about me?" Buffy asked softly.</p>

<p>"Well I'd call them more like nightmares but yeah," Faith replied as she
shrugged. "Wish the damn hospital would just let me die already. I'm sick of
reliving my past all the time in my head. I'm pretty fucked up you know?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about coming to see you tomorrow." Buffy decided to ignore
Faith's comment about being fucked up because it would only lead them to
fighting. She would tell Faith she wasn't, Faith would insist that she was
and it would end up going on forever.</p>

<p>"Why? So you can come and laugh at me, or admire what you've done to me? Or
maybe just to ease your guilt? Thanks, but no thanks B. You’re the one who
put me there and I'd appreciate it if you just left me to die."</p>

<p>"No Faith, I don't want to do that. I just want us to be friends again. It's
not too late for us to start again. I know we hurt each other pretty bad but
you still came through for us in the end. I'm sorry Faith."</p>

<p>"Don't sweat it B," Faith said trying to sound like she didn't really care.
"We're enemies now B. Things can never be the same. It's better this way
anyways. I don't fit in with you and your friends."</p>

<p>"No it's not better Faith. Nothing's better than us being friends again,"
Buffy told her as Missy's earlier words about being aggressive stuck in her
mind. "I learn from my mistakes Faith, and this time I'm not giving up on
you no matter what."</p>

<p>"So you're forgiving me, just like that?" Faith questioned, unsure of why
this was happening.</p>

<p>"If you forgive me for what I did, then yeah, I forgive you," Buffy said
with a smile. Faith turned her gaze to the floor and Buffy could tell that
the younger slayer was giving it thought. Finally after a few minutes, Faith
nodded her head and smiled at Buffy.</p>

<p>"If you think we can do it B. I can't make any promises that I won't fuck up
again though. So why with the sudden forgiveness bit anyways?" Faith
questioned as she felt Buffy's hand move on top of her own. Buffy opened her
mouth as if to speak, but she closed it again as she noticed the things in
the room begin to fade. "Hey, are you serious about coming to see me
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think I'll stop by after class. How come?"</p>

<p>"Well you think you could tell me why you're forgiving me then?" Buffy
looked at her confused after she said that and she smiled for the first time
in the dream. "I'm kind of like celery B. You know how they say plants can
actually feel things? Well I don't know if it's true or not 'cuz I'm no
scholar but if it is, then I'm celery. Well is celery even a plant?
Anyways," Faith stopped and laughed which caused Buffy to smile in return.
"I can hear and feel things, but I just can't respond to them in any sort of
way yet. So like if you go there and talk to me I can hear everything you
say."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded and gave Faith a quick hug. "I'll see you tomorrow Faith."</p>

<p>"Yeah, B. Thanks for the second chance and all," she said just before Buffy
and the dream disappeared from her.</p>

<p>When Buffy woke up the next morning the first thing she noticed was that
Missy was already gone. She was slightly disappointed because she wanted to
tell her new friend about her dream with Faith. As she looked at the clock
beside her bed though, she realized why Missy was no where in sight. She
cursed out loud as she realized she had been late for her first class not
only of the day, but of her college life all together. "Great," Buffy
muttered to herself as she pulled on some clothes.</p>

<p>By the time she got dressed and actually found where her class was supposed
to be it was already over. She thought about going and introducing herself
to her new teacher but a familiar voice stopped her from going into the
class. "Wills!" Buffy exclaimed as she saw her best friend walking down the
hall.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy. How did everything go last night?" Willow asked casually as the
two walked side by side down the hall.</p>

<p>"I found her just in time actually. She was pretty cool about finding out
there's vampires and stuff. I know you still have reservations about Missy
because of her looking like Faith, but she's a really sweet girl. I'd really
like it if you all could give her a chance."</p>

<p>"I don't know Buffy. It's so hard just to see that face again. I can try to
get over it, as long as it's not really Faith. I swear if I ever see Faith
again I'll…" Willow stopped and looked like she was trying to figure out
just what she would do to Faith. "Well I'd do something really mean," she
finally said.</p>

<p>After hearing Willow say that, she knew now wasn't the time to tell her
about her dream with Faith, or the fact that she was going to go see her in
the hospital soon. Then she also remembered what happened last time she kept
secrets from her friends. She was torn between what to do, but then she
finally decided she would wait to tell the gang about her dream, and her
going to see Faith until she knew for sure what was going on herself. "Hey,
when's you next class Wills?"</p>

<p>"Right now actually," Willow replied. "What about you?"</p>

<p>"I don't have another class until this afternoon. I was hoping we could go
hit the espresso pump or something." Buffy told her, sounding a little
disappointed.</p>

<p>"How about tonight then?" Willow asked. Buffy agreed, and Willow stopped
walking as she reached her next class. "I'll call you later," Willow told
her. The two friends said their goodbyes and Buffy headed off to her final
stop before going to see Faith at the hospital.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Buffy, what are you doing here?" Giles asked as he let his slayer into his
house.</p>

<p>"Are you really that unhappy to see me Giles?" the blonde asked as she sat
down on her watcher's couch.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," the man said as he too sat down. "I just expected you
to have classes is all. Could I offer you anything do drink?" he asked. As
he looked at Buffy he could tell she was obviously very nervous about
something.</p>

<p>"No thanks Giles," she replied as she started fidgeting.</p>

<p>"So then what brings you here this morning Buffy?"</p>

<p>"I kind of needed to talk to you about something. I had this dream last
night," Buffy started and watched as Giles took his glasses off and started
polishing them with his shirt.</p>

<p>"A prophecy?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No, nothing bad. It was a slayer dream, between Faith and I. I think. I'm
not really sure if it was real or not. So I was wondering if it were
possible for us to have shared dreams even though she's in a coma."</p>

<p>"What did Faith want?" he asked as he stood up to go find some of his books.</p>

<p>"We made up, sort of. I told her that when she wakes up from her coma that I
want us to try to be friends again," Buffy said, hoping that Giles wouldn't
be angry at her for that.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's wise Buffy? Do you really think you can trust her after
what she did to everyone?" Giles questioned as he sat back down and started
going through some books.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I don't know. I just feel like I have to at least try." Buffy
told him honestly.</p>

<p>"Well you are an adult now Buffy and I think you can make your own
decisions. Just be careful if you're going to get involved with her again."
Buffy nodded at Giles' words and waited to see what he was looking at in his
books. "Since before now there were never two slayers at once, there isn't
really any documentation on the connection between slayers. However, I do
believe that it is possible for the two of you to share dreams even if she
is in a coma. Faith has always been a very strong willed girl, and I believe
she can make it happen even if she can't respond to the outside world."</p>

<p>"So you're saying that it was a slayer dream and not just something I made
up in my head?"</p>

<p>"I'm not really sure. All I'm saying is that it would be possible for that
to happen, or at least I think it would. I even think that in time if the
two of you tried you would be able to meet in your dreams by your own will
whenever you desired to do so."</p>

<p>"Thanks Giles," Buffy stood up and smiled at him. "I'm gonna go see her at
the hospital now. She wanted me to tell her about my new roommate. She looks
just like Faith. It's pretty weird." Buffy started walking towards the door
but before she left she turned around to face her watcher again. "Could you
maybe not tell the others about this until I know what's going on a little
better?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing Buffy. Just remember to be careful, and I want you to let me
know everything that happens with this. Even if it's just you going to see
her I want you to keep me informed on it all. Understood?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah. Later," she said just seconds before slipping out of his door.
She took a steadying breath and began walking towards the hospital to see
Faith for the first time in too long.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Think you could use a lab partner?" an all too familiar voice asked Willow.
The red head practically jumped out of her chair when she heard it.
'Goddess, does she have to sound like Faith too?' Willow thought to herself.
"I'm not her you know. I don't bite Willow. I'm just trying to make a few
friends in this damn town," Missy told Willow as she sat next to her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry but it's just too weird. You're like a constant reminder of what
she did and it's just too creepy." Willow told the brunette without even
making eye contact with her.</p>

<p>"Maybe it'll be good if we work together then. It'll help you to get over
what happened and then maybe one day you'd be able to forgive her for what
she did." Missy said as she tapped her pencil against the desk. "We're
already in the same class so you'll have to get used to seeing me anyways.
Why not just work together?"</p>

<p>"Because you look like Faith. I know it's wrong of me to judge you for it,
or hold it against you. I'm sure you're a very nice person and all but I
can't deal with it. I can't deal with Faith."</p>

<p>"Hello, newsflash. I'm not Faith. You people are unbelievable. One day
you're going to have to deal with Faith because she's not going to stay in a
coma forever. Buffy told me what she did, and I can see why you'd hate her
and I have no right to tell you that you should forgive her. Hell, it's only
my second day in this town and I realize things around here aren't normal
but one thing I can tell you for sure is that if you continue to hate and be
afraid of Faith for the rest of your life, the only person you are hurting
is you. If she really is the monster you think she is, then by hating her
you're only giving her what she wants. Maybe it's not too late for you to
try and help her. Think about it," Missy said as she walked away from
Willow. 'Sweet girl my ass,' Willow thought to herself.</p>

<p>Missy wasn't actually sure where all of that had come from but ever since
she realized how Buffy really felt for Faith she knew beyond anything she
wanted to help her in any way possible. It might mean that Buffy's friends
hated her for it, but it was a sacrifice she would make for Buffy. After
all, she did owe Buffy her life now. In some sort of way, she even felt
connected to Faith simply because the two looked alike. She glanced back at
Willow who looked more angry than anything but she could also tell that the
red head was deep in thought. Missy just hoped that her words would stick in
Willow's mind, and maybe that she'd be able to get through to her in time,
if the red head would give her a chance as a friend.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Buffy said softly as she approached one of the nurses in the
hospital. "Could you please tell me where Faith Spencer's room is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's the girl that's been in a coma all summer isn't she? Are you
family?" The nurse asked as she started to lead Buffy down the hall.</p>

<p>"Just a friend," Buffy replied.</p>

<p>"Her room is right here," the nurse stopped and pointed inside the room.
"You know, you're the first visitor she's had in months." The nurse walked
away after that leaving Buffy standing outside of Faith's room. Buffy felt
an incredible sadness in her heart upon hearing the nurse say that no one
had come to see Faith in months. It made her realize how alone Faith really
is, and it gave her even more determination to become a bigger part of
Faith's life. To make sure that the brunette was never alone again.</p>

<p>As Buffy walked into Faith's room she pulled a chair up beside the bed and
sat down. "Hey sleepy head," Buffy said softly as she took Faith's hand into
her own. "I'm here as promised. Though I really wish you would wake up soon.
Hospitals definitely aren't my favorite place in the world to be and I'm
sure you don't like being here much either huh?"</p>

<p>"I had this dream last night about you," she said to Faith as she brushed a
few strands of the brunette's hair from her face. "I haven't exactly figured
out if it was a real slayer dream or just something I came up with in my
head but either way, I'm here now. If it wasn't a real slayer dream, I want
you to know I forgive you and that I want us to be friends again.</p>

<p>"I just started college, and my new roommate Missy is a rather big reason I
decided on this. I only met her yesterday, but she looks exactly like you.
It kind of gave me the wiggins at first but seeing her made me start to
think about you. I just want things to be right again for us.</p>

<p>"I stopped by Giles' house before I came here. I told him about my dream and
that I want you and I to make amends with each other. I asked him about my
dream, to see if he thought it was a real slayer dream or not but he said it
wasn't sure even though it's possible that it could have been. He even told
me that he thinks it's possible for us to control them, and make them happen
whenever we want. Pretty cool huh?"</p>

<p>Buffy stopped talking and glanced at her watch. "I know this was kind of
short, but I really have to get back to school. I already missed my first
class today and mom will kill me if she finds out I missed both of my
classes. So far college doesn't feel any different than high school. Only
difference is that it's bigger and I don't live at home. I'll come back
soon, I promise."</p>

<p>The blonde stood from her chair and looked Faith over. She gently traced her
fingers over the outline of Faith's face and bent down to give the younger
slayer a kiss on the forehead. Just as she was about to turn and walk away,
she felt Faith's hand that she was still holding softly squeeze hers.</p>

<p>Buffy felt her heart swell for some reason as she stared down at the
brunette. "Faith?" she questioned. When she didn't receive any response from
the brunette she thought that maybe she had only imagined it happening.
After watching the girl for another few minutes Buffy reluctantly left to
get to her next class. Unfortunately it was just a minute too early, and she
failed to notice Faith open her eyes just after she walked out of the room.</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 5</td></tr>
</table>

<p>When Faith opened her eyes the first thing she did was look around the empty
hospital room, wondering if Buffy had really been there to see her or if it
were all a dream. Could Buffy really have forgiven her and said that she
wanted to be friends again? 'Only one way to find out,' Faith thought to
herself.</p>

<p>After a few minutes she decided it was time to get out of the hospital and
even though her body was still a little shaky after being out of commission
for so long she managed to get out of bed. It didn't take long for her to
find the clothes that she was brought to the hospital in and she changed
back into them even though they were covered in blood stains.</p>

<p>After getting dressed, she noticed she really didn't have that much energy
at all. She placed a hand on the wall to steady herself as she peeked out of
the door to make sure there were no doctors or nurses around to notice her.
When she was sure she could get away with no one spotting her she made her
way out of the hospital as fast as she could.</p>

<p>The second she stepped outside she had to shut her eyes from the sun. After
being in a dark hospital room all comatose for a few months the sun was
blinding to her. She lifted her hand to block the light from her eyes as she
started walking towards the only place she could think of to go for answers.</p>

<hr>

<p>As Buffy sat in class she couldn't seem to stop thinking about Faith.  She
wished she could go back to the days in high school when she would skip
class just to be with Faith. As the life of a slayer goes, college didn't
seem like a necessity to her considering she could die any day and she
didn't really think she would even live long enough to finish school. But
she was doing this for her mother, her watcher, and her friends.</p>

<p>Faith was the only one who could understand the importance of living each
day how you want. Faith was the one who taught her the importance of it as
well. When the two were together, everyone thought Buffy was becoming like
Faith, careless and wild. Only the two slayers knew that Buffy was doing
exactly what she wanted, living for herself and not others for a change.</p>

<p>After Faith killed Finch and turned against her, Buffy had to go back to
being the responsible person everyone wanted her to be. She began to live
her life how everyone else wanted her to, instead of how she wanted to and
she hated Faith for it. Faith was the one who taught her how to 'find the
fun' and then she just abandoned her as soon as something didn't go her way.</p>

<p>She didn't want to hurt Faith, or fight the person she came to regard as
just as much of a best friend as Willow and Xander but she knew she had no
choice. After all, she couldn't just let the world come to an end because
she didn't want to kill Faith. When her and Faith shared the dream and Faith
told her how to defeat the mayor Buffy knew she couldn't hate the brunette
any longer. She knew that deep down Faith was just scared, and alone and
after that she vowed that one day she would make things right again with
Faith.</p>

<p>After what seemed like an eternity to Buffy the bell finally rang but as she
got up to leave the class she heard her teacher calling out to her. "Miss
Summers, if you aren't going to pay attention in my class you might as well
not bother to come anymore." Buffy just nodded at her and rolled her eyes as
she turned around to walk out of the class.</p>

<p>When she got back to her dorm room she crashed onto her bed wondering if
Willow was in a class or not. She moved to lay on her side and she noticed
that the light on their answering machine was blinking. She pressed the
button and listened to the message on it. "Hey Missy, Jan here. Les gave me
your number and I just wanted to tell you that you're insane for not coming
to school with us. There's so many hot girls here, not that you'd care about
that though. Les seems to think there's a lot of cute guys too so you would
have been happy here. Well he's actually making me go to class so I'll talk
to you later. Give us a call sometime. We miss you."</p>

<p>The machine beeped and the next message began. "Missy, you have to call me
as soon as you get this. I'm having a major crisis here. Tryouts just
started and there's this bitch that's even worse than Big Red that's going
after captain. Cliff leave me alone." The message went quiet for a few
seconds then a guy's voice came on. "Hey sis, you better call Torr soon
because she's driving me nuts." It went quiet for a few more seconds and the
girl Buffy now knew was Torrance came back on the phone. "Your brother just
doesn't understand is all. Give me a call soon. Miss ya," the girl said just
before hanging up the phone.</p>

<p>Buffy laughed as she listened to Missy's friends and she began to think
about how homesick Missy must be. Moving away from your home and friends to
come to a place like Sunnydale wasn't easy, and Buffy knew that since she
once had to do it. In the short time that they had known each other Missy
had helped her out a lot, and now Buffy wanted to help Missy become happy in
Sunnydale.</p>

<p>She remembered that she made plans to go out with Willow later but since she
was getting restless from just sitting around she was going to find Willow
now and drag her out. She jotted a quick note to leave for Missy telling her
that she had new messages on the machine even though the light wasn't
flashing on it. As an after thought she told her that her and Willow were
going to the Espresso Pump and if she got bored she should meet them up
there. Buffy placed the note on Missy's pillow hoping the girl would notice
it when she got in and headed out of her room to find her best friend.</p>

<hr>

<p>Faith stood on the porch at Giles house trying to get up the nerve to
actually knock. She knew the watcher would be home, but she was afraid that
Buffy hadn't really been in the hospital to see her. She knew she had
dreamed about Buffy, and she was almost positive that it was a slayer dream
but something in the back of her mind kept telling her that she was crazy
for thinking Buffy would ever want to be friends with her again.</p>

<p>Finally she decided to just go for it, and knocked softly on Giles front
door. When the watcher opened his front door Faith just stood there smiling
at him awkwardly, suddenly unable to speak. "Faith," he said in disbelief.
"You're... awake."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well I finally had a reason to come out of coma land," she told him
shyly. "I know I don't have any right to ask, but do you mind if I come in?
I'm wicked exhausted and I was hoping maybe you could help me find B."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," Giles said as he stepped aside to allow Faith entrance into
his house. "Buffy was by earlier saying she was going to see you. Does she
know that you're awake yet?"</p>

<p>Faith smiled as Giles said that, relieved that it wasn't just a dream. "Nah,
she left before I woke up. I heard her though, when she was there talking to
me and I wanted to wake up for her you know? But she already left when I
woke up."</p>

<p>"Well then I suggest that you stay here until we can find her. You're in no
condition to be roaming about after being in the hospital for the last few
months." Giles said as he sat down.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the concern but I'm five by five Giles. I really want to find B.
I appreciate you being nice to me and everything though, and I'm sorry for
before. I know it's just words, but I really want to try and make everything
up to all of you," Faith said as Giles held out a shirt for her.</p>

<p>"You really should at least change out of that shirt Faith," he told her.
Faith took the shirt and Giles showed her where the bathroom was so she
could change.</p>

<p>When she came back out Giles just smiled at her as he scribbled something
down on a scrap piece of paper. "Earlier I told Buffy that you were a very
strong willed girl, and you've certainly proved that by waking up just for
Buffy so I know you won't take my advice and rest until you've found her."
He stopped and handed her the paper. "Here's the address to her dorm room.
If she's not there I don't know where you'll be able to find her. Just
promise me one thing," Giles said, already concerned about the brunette.
"Don't push yourself too hard. It would do no good for you to be out of your
coma only to push yourself too much and end up back in the hospital."</p>

<p>"I'll try my best G-man. Thanks for trusting me enough to let me come in
and stuff. I promise I'll make it up to you," Faith said with a smile as she
stood up and headed out of the door to find Buffy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy stood outside of Willow's dorm room and knocked on the door hoping
that her best friend would be there. When Willow answered the door she was
relieved and walked into the room that looked exactly like hers and Missy's.
"How come your here so early? I thought you were going to wait for me to
call you," Willow said as she walked past her friend and sat down on her
bed.</p>

<p>"I know but I got bored. I figured we could go grab Oz and just head to the
Espresso Pump now." Buffy looked at the Dingos Ate My Baby poster that
Willow had taped to the wall and smiled at her friend. "You up for it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, just give me a minute to get some different clothes on." Willow
rummaged through her things and changed while Buffy inspected her room. Upon
seeing all the unpacked boxes in the room it reminded her that she needed to
get the rest of her things from home.</p>

<p>"Hey, can we stop by my mom's later so I can pick up some more of my stuff
too?" Buffy asked right after Willow announced that she was ready to leave.
The red head just nodded at her as the two walked out of the dorm room.</p>

<p>The two walked to Oz's in a comfortable silence until Willow noticed that
Buffy seemed unusually happy. "What's with you?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" Buffy asked sounding confused as her thoughts of Faith were
temporarily forgotten once again.</p>

<p>"You just seem extra peppy today. Have a good first day at school or
something?"</p>

<p>Buffy's smile grew after her friends question, and she wished that she could
tell her friend about why she was in such a good mood. She wanted to tell
them more than anything, but she wanted to be sure she was able to trust
Faith before she put her friends through that. Since she believed Faith was
still in a coma she didn't think there was any rush to tell them. "It was
pretty good I guess. How about yours?"</p>

<p>"It was fine until I got to my second class. Your roommate Missy is in there
with me." Willow said, sounding a little annoyed as she remembered that
Missy told her she should get over what Faith did.</p>

<p>"That's a bad thing?" Buffy asked seemingly dissapointed.</p>

<p>"Well it would have been fine if she didn't butt into my life and tell me
that I should forgive Faith." Just as Willow said that the two arrived at
Oz's and Willow rang the doorbell. "I mean, who could actually forgive
Faith?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I can," Buffy said softly, but her response went unnoticed by her best
friend since Oz chose to answer the door at the same time she spoke and
Willow wasn't even paying attention to her. She let out a soft sigh as it
finally sunk into her head that bringing Faith back into her life was going
to be a lot harder than she had expected it to be.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Faith reached the campus of UC Sunnydale a huge grin spread across her
face. It didn't take her too long to find the hall where Buffy's room was
and she noticed her energy reserves were severly running low as she climbed
the stairs to Buffy's dorm room. Her stomach growled loudly to remind her
that hospitals don't feed their patients well at all. She glanced back down
at the paper Giles gave to her and then up at the number on the door in
front of her.</p>

<p>'Finally,' she thought to herself as she saw that the two numbers were the
same. Faith quickly knocked on the door before she lost her nerve to even do
so and waited for what she hoped to be a friendly reunion. What she didn't
expect however was for the door to open and her double to be standing there
staring right back at her.</p>

<p>The two girls continued to look at each other for the next several
minutes.Missy was the first to recover since she had already seen a picture
of Faith and knew how alike the two looked. "You must be Faith," she said as
a small smile formed on her lips. "I kind of thought you were..."</p>

<p>"Living it up as a veggie in coma land?" Faith finished for her. "I sort of
woke up like an hour or so ago." Faith too smiled a smile that matched
Missy's exactly. "B told me that her roommate looked like me but damn."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's pretty weird. So does she know your awake?" Missy asked as she
motioned for Faith to enter the room. Faith gladly complied and walked into
the dorm wondering just how things could be going so smoothly for her.</p>

<p>"Nah, I was still out of it when she came to see me, but I heard her talking
to me and I just kind of woke up. I guess it's because I'm a..." Faith
stopped herself before she said 'slayer' unsure of if the girl actually knew
about her and Buffy.</p>

<p>"A what? You mean slayer?" Missy asked Faith who just nodded at her. "I'm
Missy by the way," she said as she held out her hand to Faith. The two girls
shook hands and Missy went to sit down on her bed. "Buffy's not here now.
She left me a note saying that her and that girl Willow are going to some
place called the Espresso Pump or something. You're welcome to stay until
she gets back though," Missy offered.</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I think I'll go find her there. I'm a little eager to see her
and tell her I'm sorry and stuff," Faith said as she stood by the door
awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I don't know if that's a good idea. That girl Willow doesn't seem very fond
of you from what I can tell from her reaction to me just looking like you."</p>

<p>"So how come your being so nice to me?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Because I can tell that Buffy really cares about you and I have no reason
to be anything but nice to you," Missy told her. "You know, Buffy did invite
me to meet them there. You could always go there and just say that you're
me, and then pull Buffy aside and tell her that it's you." Missy said with a
wicked smile. "Unless you really want to deal with Willow."</p>

<p>Faith laughed at what Missy told her and sat down on Buffy's bed, already
feeling more comfortable around the new girl. "You know, I like the way you
think."</p>

<p>"Of course, they've pointed out several times that we dress differently, so
if you show up in those leather pants they'll know it's not me."</p>

<p>"Well I don't really have anything else but leather pants to wear," Faith
said and Missy's smile just grew larger. "Wait, are you suggesting I wear
your clothes?" Missy nodded as she got up from her bed and reached into her
dresser to pull out a pair of her jeans for Faith. "Oh hell no! Those are so
not me. I'm not that eager to see Buffy," Faith told her as she crossed her
arms like a stubborn child.</p>

<p>"Yeah you are, so put them on already." Missy tossed the pair of tight jeans
to Faith and turned her back to her.</p>

<p>She heard Faith grumbling but Faith still put on the jeans though she didn't
really want to. "What makes you so sure I want to see B that bad?" she asked
as she finished pulling the jeans on.</p>

<p>"Your changing aren't you?" Missy pointed out. She heard Faith laughing from
behind her and in that moment she decided she really liked the girl, even if
she was an ex psycho.</p>

<p>"So, how do I look?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Perfect. Now go find her," Missy commanded. Faith threw her pants onto
Buffy's bed and Missy told her to just leave them there since she'd look
silly walking around with pants in her hands.</p>

<p>"Thanks for being nice to me I guess," Faith mumbled.</p>

<p>"Like I said, I haven't got any reason to be anything but nice and help you
out. If you ever need anything, you know where to find me."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'll bring the pants back soon." Faith gave Missy one last
smile before heading out the door, hoping that this time she'd actually be
able to find Buffy.</p>

<p>When Missy closed the door behind Faith she immediately got on the phone and
dialed Les' number. "Please be there," she said to herself.</p>

<p>"Hello?"</p>

<p>"Les! You're actually there," Missy said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Missy! You're actually calling me," he said mockingly.</p>

<p>"Funny. I need your help with something," she told him seriously.</p>

<p>"If you want me to do your homework for you, I can't," he relpied as he
started laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm being serious Les. I need to know how to make two people realize
they're in love with each other."</p>

<p>"Huh?" he asked confused as to why Missy would need to know something like
that already.</p>

<p>"Okay, I guess I should start from the begining here. But listen to me
because this is really important," Missy said as she began to tell him of
Buffy and Faith leaving out the vamire and demon parts knowing that he
wouldn't believe her unless he actually saw it for himself.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Well at least we all have psychology together tommorow," Buffy said, trying
to get Willow off the subject of Missy being in her science class.</p>

<p>"What do think our teacher will be like?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Buffy shrugged. The little bell on the door at the Espresso
Pump went off and Buffy looked behind Willow and Oz and noticed her roommate
walking in. Her eyes went wide as she remembered inviting Missy to meet them
up there. She hadn't expected Willow to loathe her so much. "Uhh guys,
Missy's here," Buffy said sheepishly.</p>

<p>Willow turned to look behind her and saw the girl walking towards them with
a smile on her face. She rolled her eyes as she turned back around to face
Buffy. "Come on Wills, just give her a chance for me?" Buffy asked with
puppy dog eyes.</p>

<p>"Fine, I'll be nice and try to make friends with her," Willow said.</p>

<p>As Faith walked closer to the group she saw Buffy smiling at her and she
felt as if her heart would burst. Of course she knew Buffy thought it was
Missy she was smiling at, but it's more than she ever expected in the first
place. "Hey B...uffy," Faith said, catching her mistake in calling her 'B'
before anyone noticed. Or at least she hoped.</p>

<p>Buffy patted the seat next to her and Faith sat down smiling. Buffy finally
realized that her slayer senses were going off like crazy, giving her that
warm, fuzzy feeling she always got when Faith was around but she figured
they must be off since Faith was in a coma still.</p>

<p>Oz however trusted his instincts and knew it was Faith the moment she sat
down in front of them. He knew his sense of smell had never let him down
before, and he trusted that it was right now. He didn't say anything knowing
how his girlfriend would react to it so he kept quiet while he waited for
Buffy to figure it out.</p>

<p>"Damn, I forgot my money," Faith said trying to think of a way to get Buffy
away from Willow and Oz.</p>

<p>Buffy laughed at her and stood up. "Come on up to the counter with me and
I'll buy you something," she offered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Faith asked, almost enjoying pretending to be Missy. She
could only hope that Buffy would still be this nice when she realized who it
really was. The blonde nodded in response and Faith stood up and walked off
with Buffy to go get her drink.</p>

<p>After ordering her drink and some sort of pastry, Faith leaned against the
counter and smiled at Buffy. When Buffy noticed she looked at her curiously.
"Why are you looking at me like that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I...I..." Faith stuttered, trying to find the right words to say to Buffy.
"Damn B," she said unable to come up with anything else.</p>

<p>"Faith?" Buffy asked as she went wide eyed.</p>

<p>Faith only nodded at her, still afraid of what her reaction might be. "Sorry
I pretended to be Missy. It was kind of her idea." Faith said in a small
voice. Buffy only shook her head at the taller girl, not caring about the
'how' or 'why' of it and she did the only thing she could think of. She
threw herself into Faith's arms and pulled her into the tightest hug she'd
ever given anyone in her life.</p>

<p>Faith stood in Buffy's arms with the goofiest smile on her face that she
could ever recall having. Finally she looked around the shop and noticed
Willow and Oz looking at them curiously. "As happy as I am about you not
kicking my ass and stuff, you might wanna let go B. Red's about to have a
conniption fit."</p>

<p>Buffy pulled away from Faith and blushed slightly. "Yeah, I would guess so.
She's not very fond of Missy so far. Now we're going to have to have a
reason for hugging since she thinks your Missy," Buffy said as her brain
started coming up with so many questions that she wanted to ask Faith and
she was sure Faith had just as many for her. "We need a reason to get out of
here so we can talk."</p>

<p>"Whatever you want B," Faith said casually as she got her drink from the
lady behind the counter.</p>

<p>"I know! Your boyfriend just broke up with you and you need someone to talk
to. That would explain the hug thing too right?"</p>

<p>"I don't know B. Me and boyfriend aren't really two things that go
together," Faith said. "You know me, just use 'em and discard 'em."</p>

<p>"Yeah but you're not you, you're Missy. God, this is all way too confusing.
How did you even find me here?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Later B. First we gotta get out of here."</p>

<p>"Right," Buffy replied as she watched Faith eat her pastry quickly. "Hungry
much?"</p>

<p>"Hey, I just got out of a coma. It's not like I've gotten to really eat in
the last few months. Come on, let's get back over there."</p>

<p>Faith started walking back towards where Willow and Oz were seated and Buffy
quickly caught up to her. "Try to look sad," Buffy instructed. Faith just
rolled her eyes and Buffy swatted her arm playfully, glad to have her friend
back even if there were still a lot of unresolved issues between the two of
them.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" Willow asked as soon as the two sat back down.</p>

<p>"Missy's having boyfriend troubles. She's pretty bummed about it aren't
you?" Buffy asked as she looked at Faith who seemed to be in a staring match
with Oz. After a few seconds of not responding Buffy nudged Faith in the
ribs with her elbow. "Aren't you Missy?" Buffy asked again.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah. It sucks," Faith said never breaking eye contact with Oz. "I
think I'm going to get out of here. I'm not really in a people kind of mood
now," Faith said, finally taking her eyes from Oz's.</p>

<p>"I'll come with you," Buffy said. "Maybe we could talk about it or
something," Buffy offered as she stood up with Faith.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's fiv...fine by me," Faith said as she shook her head. "See ya
around Willow," she called behind her shoulder as she walked out of the
shop.</p>

<p>"I'll see you tomorrow in class," Buffy said with an apologetic tone as she
went to follow Faith. When she got outside she saw Faith leaning against the
wall with a huge grin on her face. "What are you so happy about?" Buffy
teased as she linked arms with Faith as if nothing had ever gone wrong
between the two. "You almost blew your cover back there."</p>

<p>"Did not," Faith said defensively. "Besides, wolf boy already knows I'm not
Missy. I'm sure he'll tell Red all about it later."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Buffy asked, seeming like she wasn't really interested.</p>

<p>"So where are we going B?"</p>

<p>"Well I gotta go back to my mom's and grab some clothes, and then we can
head back to the dorms and talk." Buffy said.</p>

<p>"I don't know if that's the greatest idea B. I'm all up for telling your mom
I'm sorry for before and stuff but I just got out of a coma and I really
don't have the energy to defend myself tonight. Maybe we could just meet up
tomorrow or something?" Faith asked, wanting nothing more than to lie down
and sleep for a while. Even though she was a slayer, her body still needed
some time to get over being in a coma for the last few months.</p>

<p>"Nope, not happening. You're staying with me tonight. Besides, you've got me
on your side and mom's a forgiving person. Heck, she might not even be home
yet," Buffy told her.</p>

<p>"What, you don't trust me enough to be by myself for a while?" Faith asked.
She had meant it to seem like she was only teasing Buffy, but after she said
it she realized how serious of a question it was.</p>

<p>"I never said that Faith," Buffy replied. She too realized the importance of
the question and trust was one thing that had always been a problem between
the two. She knew that she didn't really trust Faith yet even though she
wanted to, and she didn't want to lie to the brunette so she answered the
question with one of her own. "Do I have any reason not to?"</p>

<p>Faith stopped walking and looked Buffy in the eyes. "Not anymore B," Faith
told her and the blonde could see the sincerity in her eyes. Buffy's smile
just grew as she tugged on Faith's hand and led the taller girl to her old
house. Faith sighed inwardly, upset that Buffy couldn't answer her question,
but more upset that she had actually expected Buffy to trust her already.</p>

<p>She snuck a glance at Buffy, who was still holding her hand and smiled when
she saw the smile on Buffy's face. For the first time that night she
realized just how happy Buffy was that she was back. Then and there she
vowed that she'd make up for her past mistakes knowing that whatever
troubles she'd face in the process would be worth it just see the blonde
smile the same smile she was at that moment.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Willow and Oz went their seperate ways, the red head decided to stop
by Buffy's dorm room on the way back to hers to check on the blonde and her
new roommate and maybe see why the two were acting so weird earlier. She
felt a little guilty for being a bit mean to the new girl, especially now
that she was going through some hard times with her boyfriend. When she
knocked on Buffy's door and she saw Missy open it with a small smile on her
lips she decided that maybe it was finally time to give the girl a chance.</p>

<p>"Hey Missy, is Buffy around?" Willow asked, unsure of what else to say.</p>

<p>"Uhh, not last time I checked," Missy replied. She wasn't sure if Faith had
ever found them or not so she didn't know exactly what to say to the red
head. The whole situation became too confusing for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought she'd still be here with you. I'm sorry to hear about your
boyfriend by the way. I hope everything works out for the two of you,"
Willow said sincerely.</p>

<p>Missy raised an eyebrow after Willow said that, wondering just what had
happened earlier that night. She realized Faith must have found the group
and that she was probably the one behind the whole boyfriend thing.
"Thanks," Missy simply said, playing along with whatever Faith started as
best as she could.</p>

<p>"I know I haven't been the nicest person to you so far, but if you ever need
to talk I'll be glad to listen," Willow said as she gave Missy a smile
before turning to walk away.</p>

<p>"Willow," Missy called after the girl. Willow stopped in the middle of the
hall and looked back at her. "I'll tell Buffy you stopped by for her," Missy
said with a goofy smile of her own. Willow didn't say anything else and went
on her way and Missy realized that the red head had definitely piqued her
curiousity.</p>

<hr>

<p>"See, now that wasn't bad was it?" Buffy asked Faith as they aproached the
UC Sunnydale campus. Buffy was carrying another duffle bag of clothes in one
hand while her other was holding Faith's.</p>

<p>"Only 'cuz your mom wasn't home yet," Faith smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she's going to flip when she gets back and notices someone ate her
out of house and home," Buffy teased.</p>

<p>"So what's with all the friendly vibes B? Last time I checked I tried to
kill your boyfriend and assist the mayor in ending the world and now I wake
up and your holding my hand. I don't get it." After Faith said that Buffy
tried to pull her hand from Faith's assuming the taller girl was
uncomfortable with it, but Faith just gripped her hand tighter so she
couldn't let go and smiled at her reassuringly.</p>

<p>"I thought we'd forgiven each other?" Buffy asked, not knowing what else to
say. She knew the two had a lot to talk about but she was so glad that Faith
was back and not trying to kill her she didn't really want to face the past.
"You're not the only one to blame for everything that happened Faith," Buffy
said before the brunette could respond to her question. "What you did still
hurts, and it probably will for a while. Hating you for it's not going to
get us anywhere, and before it all happened we were on our way to a really
great friendship. You're the only one who really understood me and you
taught me a lot. I just want to have another chance at that friendship if
it's not too late," Buffy confessed.</p>

<p>"Isn't that kinda supposed to be my speech?" Faith asked lightly. "I really
am sorry for everything that I did B. It just seemed to much easier to join
the other side, and then I started missing you and even the scoobies, but I
thought it was too late to come back so I just kept hurting you all even
though it hurt me too. After our fight, when I ended up in a coma, I figured
I was pretty much dead so I wanted to help you out."</p>

<p>"That's why you helped me in the dream?" Buffy asked as they reached her
dorm room.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I kinda was hoping that maybe you'd listen to me. I knew you'd find a
way to kill the mayor, but I thought that maybe if I tried to help, you'd be
able to forgive me if I ever woke up."</p>

<p>"Well then it's established. We're both sorry right?" Faith nodded at
Buffy's question. "Then it's all settled. Let's start over okay? Except this
time we try harder and don't keep secrets from each other."</p>

<p>"I think I can manage that. I don't promise anything though B. I'm pretty
fucked up sometimes, and I won't make a promise I don't know I can keep, but
I promise to try my best." Faith let go of Buffy's hand and leaned against
the wall, in no rush to go into the room since she kind of wanted to keep
Buffy to herself for a while longer.</p>

<p>"Good enough. Besides, it was kind of hard to find the fun without you,"
Buffy winked as she fumbled around for her key to the room.</p>

<p>"Aww, what's the matter B? Ain't getting enough uhhhh?" Faith asked with a
grunt.</p>

<p>"Not that it's any of your business, but no I haven't gotten any uh, uhhh
lately." Buffy shook her head as she opened the door to her room and walked
in with Faith trailing right behind her. When the two walked in Faith
immediately went to retrieve her pants that were sitting on the top of
Buffy's bed while Buffy noted Missy's happy expression as she greeted the
two. "What's with you?" Buffy inquired as she looked at Missy. She noticed
that Missy got distraced and was looking at Faith so she turned her
attention to the other brunette. "And what's with you?" Buffy asked as she
noticed Faith clinging to her pants as if they'd run away if she let go of
them.</p>

<p>"What?" Faith asked innocently. "Is it my fault if I missed my pants? You
know blue jeans aren't my thing." The two other girls just laughed and Buffy
collapsed onto her bed, exhausted from the days events.</p>

<p>"Hey, you never told me how you found me," Buffy reminded Faith.</p>

<p>"After I woke up I payed a visit to G-man 'cuz I remembered you saying
something about talking about me to him. So he told me that you were staying
here, and then I found Missy and she told me that you were out," Faith
explained as she layed down on Buffy's bed next to the blonde.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks for telling Willow I was having boyfriend troubles," Missy
interjected as she climbed under the covers into her bed since she was
already in her pj's.</p>

<p>"Sorry about that," Buffy replied as she sat up to unpack the clothes she
brought over in her duffle bag.</p>

<p>"Really, it's cool. Willow actually came by looking for you and we ended up
kinda being friends, I think," Missy told her.</p>

<p>"That's good," Buffy replied absently as she tossed some clothes to Faith.
"Go change into that so we can sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes m'am," Faith laughed out as she saluted Buffy before walking off to the
bathroom.</p>

<p>Buffy just shook her head and changed into her own pj's after Faith
dissapeared into the bathroom, not really caring about her modesty in front
of Missy. "I'm glad things are getting better between you two," Missy said
sleepily as she rolled onto her side to look at Buffy.</p>

<p>"Me too," Buffy replied with a smile. "I owe it to you too, because I would
have never gone to see her had it not been for you." Just after she said
that Faith came back into the room and the two girls decided it was best to
drop their conversation.</p>

<p>"So where am I sleeping B?" Faith asked as she stood by the wall awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Well I know my bed's kinda small but I was thinking you could sleep in
there with me. We don't really have the extra blankets and stuff to make you
a spot on the floor. Besides, you'd probably be more comfy in my bed than on
the floor even if we are kinda smushed together."</p>

<p>"Yeah sure B. Just don't wake me up when you go to class in the morning,"
Faith said with a smile. "I need my beauty sleep and all," Faith joked.</p>

<p>"Whatever," Buffy teased back as she pushed Faith into her bed, climbing
into it right after the taller girl. Missy watched the playful banter
between the two and noticed how it seemed they didn't even realize she even
existed while they were together. She wished there were something she could
to do make the two realize what any fool could see.</p>

<p>Her earlier conversation with Les came to mind as she remembered him saying
that love was something no one could control, and if they really did love
each other it would come to surface in it's own time when both were ready to
face it. She mumbled a soft 'goodnight' and turned off the lamp leaving the
room in darkness. She turned so her back was to the slayers so they could
have as much privacy as the small dorm room would allow.</p>

<p>Both slayers layed in Buffy's bed lost in similar thoughts. Neither
understood why becoming friends and forgiving each other was so easy but all
they knew was that it was right, and as a slayer you learn to trust your
instincts. There were still a lot of old wounds that needed healing but for
now they were content to just be laying side by side, taking comfort in the
others presence.</p>

<p>Buffy finally noticed that Faith was looking at her through the dark and
found the dark haired girl's hand under the covers and placed hers softly on
top of it. She had once realized that Faith was a very insecure person and
that's why she hid behind so many walls and the tuff girl image she had. It
took a lot of courage on Faith's part to try and turn her life around, and
Buffy realized this so she wanted to do her best to support Faith in any way
she could. The blonde moved so she was laying on her side facing Faith and
locked eyes with the younger girl. "Goodnight," she whispered as she
entwined her fingers with Faith's. Their eyes never left each others until
both fell into a peaceful sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning Buffy woke up late again, but only late enough so that she
had to rush to get to her class on time. Since Missy had already left for
her class, and Faith was still soundly sleeping she changed quickly in the
middle of the dorm room. As much as she knew Faith would be mad at her for
what she was about to do, she sat back down on her bed and nudged the
younger girl awake. "Morning Sunshine," Buffy teased.</p>

<p>"Sunshine my ass," Faith mumbled into her pillow.</p>

<p>"I know you didn't want me to wake you up, but I gotta go to class. I was
wondering if you'd meet me in the dining hall for lunch?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Won't Red be there too?" Faith looked up at Buffy, then closed her eyes
deciding she didn't like the light that early in the morning.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah she will be," Buffy replied sounding a little dissapointed.</p>

<p>"Of course, I could meet you there and we could just get this whole thing
out in the open already. If Red hears about this from Oz before you she'll
be pissed. Plus, if we tell her in a crowded place like the dining hall,
odds are she won't be as inclined to kill me."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I'm ready for that yet," Buffy told her as she noticed the
time on the clock. "Crap, I gotta go," Buffy called out as she grabbed her
bag and headed for the door.</p>

<p>"See ya at lunch," Faith yelled out at she pulled the covers up over her
head. Just a few seconds later she was happily asleep again.</p>

<p>Buffy ran down through the campus, bumping into a few people occasionally as
she rushed to class. She made it to class just before the bell and found a
seat in the back next to Willow and Oz. She didn't even have time to talk to
them since professor Walsh wasted no time in getting the class started.</p>

<p>Once the class began, Buffy remembered Faith saying she'd see her at lunch
and the blonde could only hope Faith was joking. It was probably selfish of
her to want to keep Faith a secret for longer and after trying it with Angel
in the past she knew it was wrong but it was a difficult situation for her.
Faith didn't have as much to loose since they weren't her friends where as
Buffy had to face them being angry at her for forgiving the brunette.</p>

<p>She sat through the rest of class spaced out, hoping that Faith would sleep
too late and miss lunch, but she knew that once the younger girl set her
mind to something there was no stopping her. Her college life hadn't started
off on the best note with her missing a class and not paying attention in
the others but she was too absorbed in her personal life to even care.</p>

<p>"Hey, earth to Buffy," Willow teased as she waved a hand in front of Buffy's
face. "You ready to go get some munchies?"</p>

<p>Buffy snapped out of her thoughts and noticed that class was over. She gave
her friend a sheepish smile and stood up. "Yeah, lets go get our munch on,"
Buffy replied, realizing the lameness of her own words.</p>

<p>The three walked to the dining hall in a comfortable silence, and when they
reached their destination Willow and Oz headed off to find a table while
Buffy grabbed a tray and got in line for food. Her eyes kept darting around
the room and she finally noticed that Oz and Willow were sitting with not
only Xander, but Missy as well. She knew it wasn't Faith from the way the
girl was dressed, and she was relieved that there was at least that
difference in the two girls.</p>

<p>Just seconds later Buffy felt a familiar tingling, fuzzy feeling wash over
her and she watched as Faith walked into the dining hall. She did her best
to hide behind her tray, not sure of what exactly she was supposed to do in
this situation and the guy behind her got her attention. "Ex boyfriend, or
loan shark?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Excuse me?" Buffy asked as she looked at him quickly, then her eyes trailed
back to Faith who was making her way to the table where the rest of the gang
was sitting and she could only groan knowing that this wasn't going to be a
peaceful lunch at all.</p>

<p>"The person you're hiding from," the male said again, trying to reclaim
Buffy's attention.</p>

<p>"Oh... Both, ugly break-up," Buffy said absently. She watched as the gang
noticed Faith's presence and she sighed to herself. She started to walk off
to go difuse the situation as best as she could but the guy called out to
her again.</p>

<p>"Parker Abrams," he stopped and held out his hand to Buffy while smiling at
her. For the first time Buffy noticed how cute the guy was and she gladly
shook his hand. "I'm at Kresge Hall."</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers, Stevenson," she told him while smiling at him before
realizing that she hadn't the time to be making new friends. "I gotta go,"
she said apologeticly.</p>

<p>"Ok, well, I'll see ya around Buffy Summers of Stevenson."</p>

<p>"See ya, Parker Abrams," Buffy gave him one last smile and walked over to
the gang, hoping that she would make it through this situation in one piece
so she could actually see the new guy around sometime.</p>
