</table>

<p>You know I'd give anything for a damn radio right about now.
Not to say that this place is all that bad. After all, I came here by
choice. It was my choice to turn myself in so I could make things
right. It's not as bad as I'd imagined prison would be, but the
silence is what kills me. Being left alone with nothing to do but
think all the time is driving me insane. </p>

<p>Okay so maybe I already am insane but what the fuck do I
care? That's the whole point of being here. At least that's what I
keep telling myself. Then I get lost in thought, and I can think of
only one thing, and that's why I'm here. Not because I think coming
here was the right thing to do, but she thought it was right.</p>

<p>She's the reason I hate thinking, because it always leads to
her. I fucking hate her for it. Or maybe I'm just trying to fool
myself into thinking I hate her so things will be easier. Not to say
I'm not sorry for the things I did because I am sorry for most of
them though I don't think I'll ever admit that to anyone. It's hard
enough just letting myself think it.</p>

<p>I don't feel bad that I killed that man at all. It goes along
with the job. Save a few thousand people and your allowed to screw up
along the way, so what's the big deal? They all act like I did it on
purpose. No, it wasn't my choice to stake him, but it happened so why
couldn't they just move on like me? </p>

<p>Instead they make me out to be the bad guy. I'm sorry I ever
came to this damn town and fucked up all their happy little lives. I
know I shouldn't have tried to blame B for it or choked Xander and
all the other shit that I pulled but I couldn't take them all looking
down on me like I was shit. Looking at me the same way my parents did.</p>

<p>Thinking back on it now, I realize all they wanted to do was
help me but I got scared. Why couldn't they just give me time to deal
my own way? They just had to go and force themselves into the
situation acting like they know how it feels. Like everything was
going be fucking peachy. Well none of them have a damn clue about how
it feels to kill someone. Sure they wanted to help, but they looked
at me like I was such a fuck up. </p>

<p>Then that night on the docks when Buffy hit me I snapped. I
know it was my fault because I couldn't keep my damn mouth shut about
soul boy but I was hurt. Just a few days ago things were perfect. Me
and B, the chosen two kicking ass like we were supposed to. I had
everything I'd ever wanted and when I killed him it was snatched away
from me. But the fucking idiot shouldn't have been roaming the alleys
in the first place! </p>

<p>I could take anything, anything in this world, but the way B
looked at me when she hit me. There was nothing but hatred and
disgust in her eyes. I know she saved me from those boxes crashing
down on me but it was too late. I wish it hadn't have been, that I
hadn't been so fucked up. But if they wanted to look at me like I was
shit, I figured I'd give them what they wanted so later that night I
went and joined the mayor.</p>

<p>It would have been best for me to just run as fucking far
from Sunnydale as possible but deep inside me I knew that I couldn't
have lived without seeing B. You know how they say 'keep your friends
close and your enemies closer'? Well I thought if I was her enemy I'd
still get to be around her kicking ass like before. I suppose it was
stupid of me to not realize it would lead to us kicking each others
asses, or her stabbing me but I'm over that now. I would have laid
down my life to protect her, yet it turns out I'm the one who hurt
her the most. Some idiot I am huh?</p>

<p>So then I end up here, in a small attempt to make things
right. I know being behind bars won't make her forgive me but maybe
now she'll realize I'll do anything for her. My only regret is that I
didn't realize that earlier. If I hadn't gotten so scared and just
turned myself in to begin with I wouldn't have lost the greatest
thing I ever had. Even if I don't regret killing him, I should have
done this for her in the first place.</p>

<p>I want to put the blame on them, or at least part of it but
it was never their fault. I didn't know how to deal and I fucked up.
Yeah, I admit it. I fucked up and now I'm sitting here driving myself
crazy because of it. I get out of here soon and I'll do whatever it
takes to get her back, because if I don't... Well I don't think I'll
survive. What's the point when you have nothing to live for? </p>

<p>It's kind of funny, how I can hate her so much even knowing
that I can't survive without her. Maybe the only reason we got along
was because of the slayer connection, but it's still the first time
I've ever felt that alive. Being with her was amazing and I want that
back somehow. As much as I hate her, since being here I've realized
the real reason this all happened. I love her just as much as I hate
her. And I'll be damned if I won't die trying to make things right. I
want the hate and the hurt to go away, so the only thing that remains
is my unconditional love for her.</p>

<p>Six days and I'll be out of here. Six fucking days and I'll
be able to see her again. Of course, as happy as I am about it, I'm
scared as hell. I know I could have broken out of here long ago if I
wanted, but then B would never forgive me. As much as I hate this
place, and those girls trying to make me their 'bitch' and the
beatings from the guards every time I loose my temper, I had to stick
around for her. </p>

<p>"You've got a visitor," a guard calls out as she unlocks my
cell. I feel a small smile forming on my lips knowing its most likely
Angel. He's offered to hook me up with a place to stay when I get out
of here. He's going to flip when he finds out I'm going back to
SunnyD to make things up to B. I still can't get over how much he's
willing to help me though. I tried killing him a few times and taking
his soul, yet he's still forgiven me. I know he only forgave because
he knows how it feels to be in my situation, but it gives me hope
that if he can, maybe B will be able to forgive too.</p>

<p>Before I leave I grab the journal he gave me so I can share
some stuff with him. When he gave it to me I just laughed at him for
thinking I'd actually write in the damn thing but it's turned out to
be a big help. It's scary enough thinking some of the things I do,
but reading my thoughts is worse. It's good for me though, to have a
way to organize my thoughts and deal with my frustrations. Writing
them out always seems to help.</p>

<p>I let the guard cuff me and I follow her to the visiting
room. I'm a little surprised when she leads me to an empty room.
Normally we don't get to be alone with our visitors. We just have to
do the whole over the phone thing, but I suppose they figure since
I'm getting out it'll be okay. She uncuffs me then leaves the room
and I'm starting to wonder where the hell soul boy is.</p>

<p>Finally the door opens behind me and I turn around to see, no
not soul boy, but Buffy. My smile quickly fades but I try not to take
the defensive. I'm sure she didn't come to prison to kick my ass, and
if I fight I'll get one hell of a beating not only from her, but from
the guards. "Miss me?" I let a cocky smile spread across my lips and
she just walks past me to sit down at the other end of the table.</p>

<p>"Angel told me your getting out in a few days." From the look
in her eyes I can tell she's still really pissed at me. I want to
make some smart-ass comment but I know it's the wrong thing to do. I
can't play with her like I used to. I shrug and she gets straight to
the point. "Don't you even think about coming to finish what you
started. If you show your face in Sunnydale again I'll finish what I
started." She lowered her gaze to my stomach and I knew exactly what
she was talking about.</p>

<p>I wince and turn my eyes away from hers knowing there's no
way I could hide the hurt in them. "I really hope you don't mean
that," I say softly, not trusting my own voice. "I'm going to come
back, because I have to make things right with you somehow."</p>

<p>"It's too late for that Faith. I tried so many times to help
you but you pushed me away every time. Do you know how bad that hurt
me? To know one of my friends would push me away like that."</p>

<p>I realize talking with her now won't get us anywhere. We
don't have nearly enough time, and I know her anger won't go away
before she has to leave.  "I thought you were Angel, since he's the
only one who ever comes to visit me. Well Cordy came once insisting
that I let her give me a haircut but that didn't really count." I
stop and pick up my journal. She's looking at me puzzled, wondering
where the hell I'm going with this. "There's some stuff in here I was
going to share with him but I want you to have it. I really want to
make things right with you. If you read this you might believe me. No
more secrets B. Everything I am is in there. If you take it and read
it and still want to kick my ass out of Sunnydale when I get out,
feel free."</p>

<p>"Why should I believe anything in here is true?"</p>

<p>I'm trying my best not to loose my temper with her, but I
really want to yell at her. I know redemption isn't easy but I was
supposed to have time to prepare for seeing her again. Now I've gotta
shoot from the hip. "I didn't know you'd be coming here B. It's not
like I thought 'Oh, well she's coming so let me make up a lot of
bullshit and hope she buys it'. If you read that, you'll know
everything. You'll know why I did the things I did, you'll know how I
was before I came here, and you'll know how sorry I am." I stop and
bow my head. "And you'll know how I really feel about you."</p>

<p>I'm not looking at her, but I know she's wondering what the
hell that's supposed to mean. "How do you feel about me Faith?" Her
voice is finally soft, and for the first time she's let her wall down
in the few minutes she's been her. I lift my gaze so our eyes lock
and the anger isn't in there right now. For the first time in a long
time she's not looking at me like I'm shit so I take a deep breath
trying to get the nerve to tell her.</p>

<p>"B..." She gives me a small smile to encourage me to go on
and my heart starts being a million times faster. "I don't know how
to say it," I whisper.</p>

<p>"I thought you just said no more secrets Faith." She sounds a
little annoyed and I can tell she's putting her walls back up so I
quickly get the nerve to do what I've only dreamed about. I stand up
and walk to her and kneel down beside her. I brush a stray lock of
hair behind her ear and caress her cheek with my hand. "Faith?" she
questions what I'm doing almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>I smile at her, and as my mouth opens to speak the words I've
been longing to say to her the door to the room opens again and I
scurry away from her. I want to pounce on the guard and beat the shit
out of her for interrupting my moment, and as I look at B she's
obviously thinking the same thing. The lady walks over and cuffs me
again announcing that visiting hours are over. I'm sure B knows what
I was going to say to her anyways. We've always been able to read
each other like a book, maybe because of the slayer connection. I
tried my best to hide from her before but it obviously did no good so
this time I'll let her read as much as she wants.</p>

<p>As I turn around to walk out I feel her hand on my shoulder
stopping me. I turn around slowly expecting her to hit me, but
instead she pulls me into a soft hug. "Your still not forgiven you
know," she whispers. I wish I could have hugged her back, but since
my hands were cuffed there wasn't much I could do. </p>

<p>I give her a small smile when she lets go of me and walks
out. All the hell I just went through in prison, that one hug from
her made it all worthwhile. I know she's still pissed at me, but that
hug was a promise. A promise that I'll have my second chance. </p>

<p>I lay in my bed now, finding sleep impossible, not that it's
anything new. I've never had an easy time sleeping in this place and
not just because of all the noise the other inmates make. I do think
they really like to piss me off, but I can't say I haven't enjoyed
pissing them off at times. But after my last fight I learned to keep
to myself. It's hell knowing that I could take every single person in
this place, but I have to let them beat on me if I want to get out of
here. </p>

<p>Normally when I try to sleep I just have nightmares about the
things I've done. Mostly the things I did to B. I suppose I deserve
the nightmares, and the pain that comes from them but it would be
nice to just get one night of peaceful sleep. The reason I can't
sleep tonight is still her, as it always has been, but not because of
my nightmares. But B has my journal and now she'll read all about how
fucked up I am. What was I thinking when I gave that to her?</p>

<p>I just wanted her to know how much I love her. She'll know
I'm sorry for what I did, but what's she going to think when she
reads I did everything out of love? I'm sure she'll just be ecstatic
to know I tried to kill her boyfriend and torture her friends because
I loved her. Some great way of showing your love huh? But how could
she not get it in the first place? </p>

<p>I know I need to get these thoughts out of my head. I just
gotta remember the hug. Great, now I've got that goofy smile on my
face again all because B hugged me. Some bad ass I am. Turn into a
giggling five year old all because of some stupid hug. </p>

<p>Maybe if I just close my eyes for long enough I'll fall
asleep. I've only got a few days left in here and then the real test
begins. Yes, sleep is good.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>"Faith?" </p>

<p>All the sudden my eyes shoot open but something's
different. "B...?" I look around me but I'm not in prison anymore.
Oh, I get it, slayer dreams. Duh. Finally I see her and she's sitting
on this couch in what I'm guessing to be her hotel room. "You know we
haven't shared a dream in a long time B. Another end of the world
crisis?" I ask with a smile. I know this is one of our slayer dreams
because it's too real to be another of my nightmares. Being a slayer
definitely has its perks.</p>

<p>"No, not this time Faith. I'm not exactly sure why we're
here. I guess we were both thinking about each other before we fell
asleep." She starts walking towards me and my body tenses. She
doesn't look angry but I've learned to always expect the worst. Then
you'll never be disappointed. </p>

<p>"I see you've been doing some reading," I say to her as I
point to my open journal on the table. "Now you know how fucked up I
am, if you didn't figure it out before." I spot the radio that's on a
small table beside her bed and I walk over to it and flick it
on. "I've been dying to hear some damn music you know? I hate how
it's so quiet in there sometimes."</p>

<p>I'm not looking at her but I know she's walking up behind me
and I just start singing. "Loaded, I've loaded up this gun. There's a
killer in me." </p>

<p>"Hoping, hope that you're the one. But you always run away
when I come around." She finishes the singing the song and puts her
hand softly on my back. I shut up wondering what the hell this dream
is supposed to mean. "I'll be here when you get out Faith. Come home
to Sunnydale with me?"</p>

<p>"Why? We hate each other B. Haven't I caused you enough pain
already?" Her small arms wrap around my waist as if in answer to my
question.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say you meant everything in that journal?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I did." I want to turn around and return her embrace
but I'm too scared. Maybe this isn't a slayer dream after all.
There's no way B would want me to come with her.</p>

<p>"Then don't you love me? If you want to make it up to me,
come home with me and make things right. You don't hate me Faith, and
I don't hate you. As much as I wish I could at times, I've never been
able to. You got lost somewhere along the way, we both did and you
know as well as I do we need each other."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurt you anymore B. I never wanted to. I'm
sorry." She walks in front of me and I notice the unshed tears in her
eyes. I laugh quietly at the thought of her crying over me, the one
person who's caused her more pain than anyone else. She lifts her
hand and wipes away the few stray tears that I've let slip past my
eyes and for the first time I let myself embrace her. "I know you
haven't forgiven me yet but I want to make it up to you. I'll do
anything you want, and I..." I stop and take a deep breath. She's
looking in my eyes now, and hers are almost pleading me to say it.
The words I've never spoken to anyone in my life. "I love you."</p>

<p>"I love you too Faith. That's why I came to see you earlier
and why I couldn't keep up that pissy attitude when you came close to
me. I never realized it, until that moment in prison when you were so
close to me. Then it all made sense. There's still a lot that we'll
have to work out when you get out and I want to discuss some of the
things in this journal. But I'll be waiting for you. I always have
been."

	"No more hate and fighting?" I question. I know it's silly to
ask her since I've been the one to start the fighting most of the
times but I just need to be sure that she really wants to go through
this. We've hurt each other so much I'm not sure how to make all of
it go away but maybe this love stuff will work.</p>

<p>The things in the room around us start to fade and I know it
means one of us is waking up. I swear if it's me I'm going to beat
the shit out of myself for ruining my moment with B. "No more hate
Faith," she whispers as she gives me a soft kiss on the cheek. "See
you in a few days," she says as everything fades away.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>My eyes open slowly and I look around to find I'm back in my
cell. I want to curse at myself like I usually do for ruining things
but something stops me. I stand to look out at the night sky through
the small window in my cell. The sun is just beginning to rise and I
feel like with the new day I'm being given a chance to start my life
again. To start the right way with B at my side.</p>

<p>I can still feel her in my embrace, and her soft lips on my
cheek. Even though I'll always have to live with the regret of the
things I've done, it's nice to know that at least I can make some
things right and that B's willing to help me. What I've done to
deserve any of it, I'm still not sure of but one thing I have learned
in my life is to never question fate. And that's exactly what brought
B and I together. We were made for each other and it's not too late
for me to show her just how much I love her.</p>

<p>In just a few hours I'll be out of this hellhole. I haven't
seen Angel in a long time and I'm starting to wonder what will happen
when I get out. He was supposed to come by to talk to me about living
arrangements, but ever since that dream I had with B I'm not sure
what the hell is going on. I haven't seen her either, so I'm starting
to think that maybe that wasn't really a slayer dream. I should have
known better in the first place. After all, why would she want me to
go back with her? </p>

<p>Of course, it may have been a slayer dream. She knows I love
her now and she could be using that to get back at me. Give me the
false hope of a second chance and then snatch it away from me just
like I tried to take the things that meant the most to her away. But
is B really the type to do that sort of thing? I know she has every
right to hate me after what I did to her, but she'd be sinking to my
level to do something like that and she's nothing like me. </p>

<p>No, she's everything I'm not. Everything I wish I could be
and the only thing I've ever really wanted in life. She's the reason
I can't give up, no matter what. Even if the dream wasn't real, if
she does still hate me I'll spend the rest of my life fighting for
her. I have to have some reason to live after all, and saving the
world that fucked me is hardly it. </p>

<p>The last few days have been pure hell on me. I thought I'd be
glad to get out of here, but in truth I'm scared as hell. It's so
much easier sitting here and being sorry, than actually having to
face the people who's lives I tried to hurt. The only thing that's
keeping me even half together is that in my dream B said she loved
me. Maybe it was a lie, and I suppose I'll soon find out if it was or
not but it sure was nice. I wish I could sleep, or maybe even write
but there's nothing for me to do other than stare at the wall for the
next few hours and hope beyond all hope that B's around still when I
get out. </p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>The sound of keys clanging breaks me from my trance and I
finally manage to break my gaze from the wall that I've been staring
at. The guard stops at my cell and starts unlocking it, a look of
disgust on her face that I can't help but smile at. I give her a
cocky smile and a look that lets her know I hate her just as much as
she hates me. </p>

<p>I expect her to cuff me like she always does but as soon as
my cell is unlocked she starts walking away so I grab the few things
I have and follow her. All the other inmates are looking at me too,
and as I walk out I can feel the heat of their stares on my back. I
pause and then turn around to blow them a kiss and give them the same
look of hate that I gave the guard just a few moments ago. A few of
them shout obscenities at me and I just walk off, finally on my way
to freedom, and more importantly, on my way to B.</p>

<p>I'm stopped to fill out some paper work, and it seems like I
can't sign my name fast enough. I just want to get the hell out of
here. Even though it only takes a few minutes to fill the papers out
it seems like a lifetime. "I don't want to see you back in here
again," the man behind the desk tell me. Maybe he thinks his words
are what's going to keep my in line when I get out. I just give him a
half smile and turn around and stare at the door. This is it. </p>

<p>Here and now, my second chance begins. This is my chance to
live life like I should have in the first place. I feel the smile
spread across my lips as I step outside. Soon I make my way out of
the gates to the parking lot and look around as if I've never been
outdoors before, taking everything around me in. Then finally it all
sinks in. Where do I go from here? </p>

<p>I start walking towards the street with no destination in
mind just yet but then a voice stops me dead in my tracks. "Trying to
run away from me already?" I can't help but laugh, and it seems that
it's the only thing I can do since my body seems to be glued in
place. I guess she wasn't lying in the dream.</p>

<p>"B, you know your nuts right?" I say as I turn around to face
her. It's a good thing I spoke before I looked at her, because I'm
sure that I wouldn't have been able to speak after looking at her.
Just when you think a person can't be any more beautiful than they
already are, they gotta go and prove you wrong.</p>

<p>"I know you probably want some exorcise after being stuck in
that small cell, but I'd rather have you drive back to Sunnydale with
me than have you walk." She gives me that little laugh and smile of
hers and before I know what I'm doing I have her pulled into my arms.</p>

<p>"That dream was real wasn't it?" I ask as I bury my face in
her hair trying to hide the tears that are threatening to spill from
my eyes. "Can you really give me another chance B? I'm so sorry for
all I did but if you can't forgive me I understand."</p>

<p>"I forgive you Faith. When I came here to see you, I had no
intentions of ever saying this, but I forgive you. I won't forget any
of it, but I can forgive." She pulled herself out of my arms and look
at me.  She brought her hand up to wipe away the few stray tears that
slipped from my eyes and smiles softly at me, assuring me that what
she says is true. "You have to promise me one thing though."</p>

<p>"Anything B." Hesitantly I take her hand in my own, and watch
her eyes to gauge her reaction. She gives my hand a soft squeeze as
our fingers entwine to let me know it's okay.</p>

<p>"Promise me you'll never leave me alone again."</p>

<p>I look a little confused for a moment at that. It's not like
B's ever been alone with the scoobs and her family around. But then I
remember the dream, and her saying she loved me too and the
realization sets in. "I promise B. I'll always be with you." She's
searching my eyes and I smile at her to let her know I won't hide
anything though there's something I'm dying to say and I assume she
can tell.</p>

<p>"You can say it you know." Yup, she knows.</p>

<p>I nod slowly and look her in the eyes. I reach my hand up and
brush a few strands of her hair behind her ear and let my palm gently
rest on her cheek. "I love you B." Before I have a chance to be
afraid of what I just said I feel her arms around my neck, slowly
pulling me towards her. Just as my eyes close I feel her lips softly
brush against mine and I start to wonder if this is another dream of
mine. The kiss slowly deepens and I realize something. </p>

<p>I've never felt like I belong anywhere before. I've never
been loved, or needed but now I finally realize that I belong with
her. Our bond as slayers brought us together. A bond that no one will
ever be able to touch, and somehow through all the hurt we've come to
love each other.</p>

<p>She wraps her arms around my waist and ends the kiss much too
soon. "I love you Faith." I feel her lips press softly against my
neck and she takes hold of my hand and starts leading me towards her
car. "Lets go home," she says softly. I still don't know where I'm
going to stay, or what will happen once I get back in good 'ol
Sunnydale but one things for sure. B is my home; my safe place and
where she goes, I'll gladly follow.</p>

<p>The drive back to Sunnydale was rather uneventful. Neither of
us talked, but it was a comfortable silence between us. About halfway
through the trip B took my hand into her own and gave me this smile
that made me loathe myself. All the sudden it sank in that I caused
her years of hurt, and here she is saying she loves me. I took my
free hand and delicately began to trace patterns on the top of her
hand that was holding mine. I can feel the tears forming in my eyes
and I know that there's nothing I could ever do to make this up to
her, or anyway that I could ever forgive myself. </p>

<p>I look at B and the tears are falling freely down my face,
and she still doesn't say anything. She only squeezes my hand softly
knowing that nothing she says right now could make me feel any
better. I'm craving more contact with her and if she weren't driving
right now I'd pull her into my arms and never let her go. It's almost
a scary feeling I have, like I just want to melt into her, to
completely become connected to her beyond just the slayer part. I've
always needed B, but only now will I let myself admit that. I used to
think that needing someone made me weak, almost like being second
best. I know B doesn't think I'm weak though, or second best to her.
She's always seen us as equals, and I was just too far gone to
believe her.  </p>

<p>It's almost funny to think that prison is what made me sane,
if you can call it sanity that I have. I guess we'll find out if I
can really be good and stop hurting people that I care about. Finally
my tears stop and I raise her hand and kiss it softly and she smiles
at me again. "I love you Buffy. I know I screw things up a lot, but
if you help me I can be good for you." I feel incredibly lame, asking
for help but I know I can't do this without her help. She is the only
reason I still live, and there's no point in denying that I need her
any longer. No more games, no more walls between us from now on. </p>

<p>She pulls off the highway and we pass a big sign that's off
to the side of the road. In big letters, instead of saying `Welcome
To Sunnydale' some kid must've stuck a piece of cardboard that he
wrote on in front of the `dale' part so it now reads `Welcome To
Sunnyhell'. If only the people that lived here knew how true that
was. I take a deep breath as we drive further into town, knowing now
my chance to prove I'm different really starts. Here is my second
chance on a silver platter and I've never been so scared in my life. </p>

<p>When B stopped outside of her house I was most surprised. I
knew she said we were going home, but I thought she just meant
Sunnydale. I had no idea she meant her home. "B, I don't think your
family's going to be particularly happy with me coming here." I say,
suddenly regretting the things I did to them in the past. </p>

<p>"Well Dawn's always liked you so I don't think she'll mind
that much if you stay here. There's no way I want you going back to
that cheap motel. And I'm sure there's the apartment from the mayor
but I kind of wanted you to stay with me."  When she shuts the
ignition off the silence consumes us, neither knowing where exactly
to go from here. As odd as it might seem, us making up was the easy
part.</p>

<p>"What about Miss S? She won't want me in her house after what
I did to her." She looks at me confused, and I see the hurt in her
eyes at the mention of her mother's name. I know the hurt in those
beautiful eyes can mean only one thing. "No, that can't be," I
whisper more to myself than anyone else. Miss S was always cool to
me, even after all I did. She was almost the mother I never had, but
of course I had to screw that up along with everything else that I
had going for me in this town. </p>

<p>"It wasn't vampires or anything. There was this tumor and we
couldn't do anything. I thought Angel would have told you." Buffy
wrapped her arms around herself and I suddenly realized just how much
I really do love her. I never wanted to let anything hurt her like
that again.  I wanted to say something reassuring, to take her into
my arms and tell her how sorry I was, but it seemed as if my own body
was numb. In fact, we both probably would have stayed there being the
doom and gloom twins for the rest of the day had it not been for Dawn
who chose then to come and greet us. </p>

<p>Now while Angel didn't tell me about Miss S, he did tell me
that Dawn isn't really B's sister. All my memories of her are just
made up or some bullshit. She's some key or something and B died to
save her, but like last time she died, it didn't last for long.
That's B for you, the unstoppable one. I never found out how she came
back to life, but death isn't the topic I wish to stay on at the
moment so I'll save it for later. Instead B and I hop out of the car
and Dawn practically jumps on me and gives me the biggest hug I've
ever gotten in my life. I guess no one bothered to tell her just how
much of a psycho I was and the things I did to her mom. </p>

<p>"Miss me much D?" I ask as she pulls me into the house. She
smiles when I call her D and I can't help but remember the first time
I called her that. She used to get so jealous of how I called B, well
B. So I called her D once, just to try it out and she practically
beamed. If I didn't know better I'd say the kid had a crush on me. </p>

<p>"Are you going to stay with us?" Dawn looked from me to B;
and I just shrugged. I really had no clue what was going on, or where
I go from here. I guess B and I are together now, so SunnyD is my
home again but I still feel like I don't fit in around here. </p>

<p>"I was hoping you would stay with us Faith. I'd really like
it if you did." B says in that soft shy voice of hers and there's no
way I could ever refuse her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I mean, if you're sure you want me here. I'd be glad
to stay. On one condition that is," a smile forms across my lips as I
see the nervous looks they give me. It's nice to know I can still
make them sweat a bit. "As soon as that sun's finished setting we go
kick some ass. I've been aching for a good slay."</p>

<p>B laughs and nods, and I can tell she's semi relieved that it
wasn't something else. Dawn just looks at me like I'm crazy for
actually enjoying slaying. But that's what I was born for. I was born
a killer and it would do me no good to hate what I do. Just then my
stomach speaks up letting out a loud growl and I almost find myself
blushing as the two sisters stare at me. "What?
It's not like they feed us well in prison."</p>

<p>"Well since this is your home now, feel free to help yourself
to anything you want." </p>

<p>Did she just say home? Damn, I have a home. If I were the
sentimental type, which I'm not, I would have pulled the two of them
into a hug and thanked them for helping me get my life back in order.
Instead I just smile at them and go to raid the kitchen. There isn't
much in there, and I know I'll be hungry as hell after slaying so I
settle for a bowl of Dawn's cereal and when I go back into the living
room I notice the two of them took off to do their own thing. I
collapse onto the couch, where I assume I'll be sleeping from now on
and turn on some cartoons. </p>

<p>"Glad to see you've made yourself at home," B's standing
behind the couch and I wonder how long she's been watching me. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't…" I start but a pair of soft fingers on
my lips silences me.</p>

<p>"No apologies Faith. Like I said, this is your home. I like
it like this. It's kind of like I'm seeing the real Faith for the
first time. And I'm falling more in love with you than I ever thought
possible." Before I could say anything in response B's fingers were
soon replaced with her soft lips gently pressed against mine. I wrap
my arms around her waist to deepen the kiss with her but before we
can go on any longer I here Dawn clearing her throat and I quickly
pull away from B.</p>

<p>"I…I…" Oh God, I've turned into an idiot. Can't think. Are my
cheeks burning? They are. I'm blushing. What the hell is this? I look
up to find the two of them laughing at my embarrassment.</p>

<p>"You what Faith?" Dawn's got an evil glint in her eyes and I
know she's just waiting to tease the hell out of me. Good thing I'm
just one step ahead of her. And thanks to my great slayer speed,
before she even knows what's happening I've got her pinned to the
ground and I'm tickling her. I don't really know why I'm doing it,
because I've never been one to play around like this before but it
just seems like the thing to do. The only kind of playing I did was
with guys, and I'd rather not revisit those days. </p>

<p>"Buffy, help!" Dawn actually yelps as I continue to tickle
her. I move so I'm straddling her hips making sure that there's no
chance of her escaping. After a few more seconds of the tickle
torture I stop to look up at B who's laughing so hard she's crying,
and then look at Dawn whose face is a deep shade of red. It's not
even been a full day since I've been out of prison and I've already
got a home, a girlfriend, and Dawn who is like my own kid sister. I
pull myself off Dawn and go to sit back on the couch. </p>

<p>"Faith?" I know they're both looking at me but I can't face
them now. I can't do this. I'm Faith, the fuck up. I don't deserve
this because I know I'll only let them down in the end.</p>

<p>"You ready to go kick some vamp ass?" I ask before I turn
around. B knows better than to ask questions in front of Dawn, but
she knows something's wrong too. Guess I'll have to talk about it
while we're out. After all, I did promise no secrets this time.</p>

<p>"Faith?" I finally look at Dawn and can tell she's worried
about me. She's a cool kid, and if I stick around this place, which
I'm sure B will make me, taking care of her becomes my first priority.</p>

<p>"I'm five by five D," I smile at her reassuringly as I walk
to the door. B goes into mother mode and tells Dawn she better not go
anywhere while we're gone and that she shouldn't stay up too late.
Dawn's just rolling her eyes at B and eventually I grab her arm and
pull her out the door. "We'll be back later," I call out as I shut
the door behind me. B shoots me a look that tells me she's not
exactly thrilled that I didn't let her finish being motherly, so I
mimic D and roll my eyes at her.</p>

<p>She swats at my arm playfully and as I smile at her I see the
serious look spread across her features. Cautiously, she reaches out
and takes my hand in hers and as our fingers entwine I realize how
scared I really am. "I don't deserve any of this B. You shouldn't
love me after what I did. You shouldn't give me a home or trust me
with your little sister. I'll fuck everything up like I always do," I
say to her before she even gets to ask her question.</p>

<p>"You know I'm going to disagree with you, don't you? Yes,
you've done a lot of things that weren't the greatest, but I've
messed up too. My mom has, Giles has. I know you're not a bad person
Faith and I love you. Dawn adores you and thinks you're the coolest
person to ever walk the earth practically. I read your journal, and
in it you said you'd rather die than ever hurt me again."</p>

<p>"I would B. That's why you have to let me leave, before I
hurt you. I couldn't live with myself if I ever did that again. How
can you just forgive me so easily when I can't even forgive myself?"</p>

<p>"The only way you'll hurt me is if you leave me alone again
Faith. It would kill me, and Dawn. Don't do that to us," her voice
cracks and it almost sounds like she's pleading with me. There's a
look of such desperation in her eyes that it breaks my heart, but
knowing she's that serious about me being with her finally makes me
realize she loves me as much as I love her. I can't let my fears of
hurting her control me because then I'll never be able to be truly
happy. Not that I think I deserve any sort of happiness, but B wants
me happy. </p>

<p>Knowing that any words I say wouldn't be enough to show her
just how much I love her I pull her into my arms and hold her to me
tightly. I lift her chin with two fingers and kiss her as tenderly as
possible. I feel as if I could drown in her touch, and loose myself
in her when we kiss. It's the most incredible thing I've ever felt.
Believe me, I've felt a lot of things but none of them compare to
this love stuff. </p>

<p>"Come on, it's been a long day. Lets go kick some ass so I
can get you in bed." </p>

<p>I raise an eyebrow at that statement and I get one of those
goofy grins that only B is capable of giving me. "You want me that
bad huh?" Now it's her turn to roll her eyes as she drags me along
behind her. </p>

<p>"I just want to cuddle with you," she says in a voice so
innocent I hardly recognize it as hers. I'm not exactly sure what
this cuddling stuff is, considering I've never done it before but as
long as it involves B I'm sure it's good. She kisses me again and for
a moment I forget we're even standing in the middle of a graveyard.
Funny how she can make even this place seem romantic. At least until
you see a slimy demon about to hit your girlfriend in the head with
some rather large blunt object.</p>

<p>I push her out of the way just in time to be on the receiving
end of the wooden hammer that was just about to hit B. "Oh fuck," is
all I can say as darkness engulfs me. Next time I'll know better than
to let my guard down in a graveyard. I just hope B can kick this
things ass.</p>

<p>When I came back to consciousness, before I even managed to open my
eyes I realized I was in the place I hated most in all the world. Sunnydale
hospital, where I spent eight months as a vegetable thanks to B. Not that I
can blame her for putting me here in the first place. I was wicked psycho
back then and tried to kill Angel. Knowing that she chose him over me still
makes me sick, even if I am with her now. But then I have to realize that
it’s not like I ever really told her how I felt. At least not in a way she
would understand. She was too naïve to get the meaning behind all those
sexual innuendos of mine.</p>

<p>Before my thoughts get the best of me I hear arguing coming from outside of
my room and I force my eyes open. It’s bright as hell in my room, but I
figure my eyes just need some time to adjust. “B?” I whisper, hoping she’s
in the room with me. I feel two soft hands cover one of my own, but know
they’re too big to be B’s.</p>

<p>“She’s out in the hall with Willow,” the person, who’s voice I recognize as
Dawn’s tells me. I blink my eyes rapidly a few times trying to get them to
focus, and finally I see her smiling down at me.</p>

<p>“How long was I out of it this time?” In response she just laughs at me,
which I’m hoping is a good sign.</p>

<p>“It was only for a few hours Faith, but you had us worried. Especially me.”
My sight is getting clearer thanks to my slayer healing I assume and I
notice her eyes are red from crying.</p>

<p>“You know me, I’m five by five. You don’t think I’d be leaving my new
family already do you? I gotta keep kickin’ so I can take care of you and
B.” I was almost stunned that I called them my family, and from the look on
Dawn’s face she was too. I never had a family before, or at least not one
that cared about me. It’s weird to think I’ve finally gotten one so late
into my life, but the word flowed so easily from my mouth. “B’s okay right?”
I ask suddenly remembering the demon that put me here in the first place.</p>

<p>“Yeah, she’s okay. She was in here but,” Dawn trailed off, and she looked
almost afraid to continue. I guess I can’t expect them to always remember
I’m not the same monster I was before, and that I couldn’t ever be mad at
her. I have a pounding headache and talking only makes it worse so I only
squeeze her hand in reassurance. “I know everyone around here kind of holds
a grudge against you other than Buffy and me, and that you probably don’t
want to deal with them yet since you’ve only been back for a day but I told
Willow you were here. Buffy called me and told me what happened and I was so
scared. I just wanted to come here and make sure you were okay and that I
didn’t loose another person I care about like I did mother so I called
Willow and asked her to bring me here. They’re kind of out there fighting
about things now.”</p>

<p>“Red’s not to happy that I’m back huh?” I ask with a chuckle as Dawn shakes
her head. If I weren’t stuck here, I would have loved to see the look on
Red’s face when Dawn told her I was back. Of course I am back to make
amends, but some things will never change. Like the thrill I get from
spooking out the scoobs. “You think you could tell B I’m ready to get the
hell out of here?”</p>

<p>A few seconds after she leaves my room they B comes in with a very
skeptical red head behind her. If Dawn weren’t in the room I would have said
something just to piss Red off. I know B would forgive me, but I don’t want
the kid to see how fucked up I can be. Of course, if I can’t be nasty I can
always get to her in other ways. B notices the smile spread across my face
and her eyes narrow as she walks closer to me. She knows I’m up to
something, and she’ll probably kick my ass for this when I’m better but
it’ll be worth it. As soon as she’s close enough I pull her down into a deep
kiss.</p>

<p>She doesn’t respond at first, probably because Red’s in the room but
eventually she relents and kisses me back. I can hear Dawn giggling in the
background and B quickly pulls herself away from me, her face fully flushed.
Red looks like a deer caught in headlights so I start giggling along with
Dawn. Yes, I was actually giggling. It is the new me after all, and when I’m
around Dawn I seem to devolve a few years and my brain functions as if I
were Dawns age. B glares at us, letting us know we’re both in trouble when
we get home which just leads us to laughing harder, of course until the
throbbing in my head resumed.</p>

<p>“Oh Goddess, I gotta,” and Red was out the door before she could even
finish her sentence.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you two,” Buffy said almost angrily. “Willow’s my best
friend and you can’t just go scaring her off like that.” I feel almost
ashamed for what I did, but seeing the look on Red’s face was still worth it
to me.</p>

<p>“It’s not her fault Buffy. We were talking before I got you and I dared her
to do it.” I spin my head so fast to look at Dawn I think I could’ve given
myself whiplash. Dawn was actually trying to take the wrap for me? Out of
everything that’s ever happened in my life, nothing has ever compared to the
amount of happiness that gave me, not even B saying she loved me. B is
everything to me, but no one’s ever been willing to take the blame for me
before. She even looked so proud about it, I just sat there stunned, unable
to tell B she was lying.</p>

<p>“I’m going to go fill out the paper work so we can get out of here. You two
be good, or else I’ll send you to your rooms when we get home,” B says in
that motherly voice of hers that leaves me and Dawn no choice but to mumble
‘yes mommy dearest.’</p>

<p>When B’s gone I have Dawn help me change back into my street clothes and
somehow I decide I should talk to her about the things I did before. “Hey D,
you know you’re like a kid sister to me right?” I ask and she looks at me
and nods. “Do you know about the things I did before I went to prison, and
why everyone around here hates me?”</p>

<p>“Kind of,” she answers honestly. “I know of what you did, but not in detail
or anything. Everyone figured I was too young I guess, but I know it was
pretty bad stuff if they wouldn’t tell me about it.” She hands me my shoes
without even looking at me. I can tell that even though she didn’t know
everything, the memories of what happened still hurt her. It was hard for me
to talk about this stuff again, and while a part of me thought I should be
discussing this stuff with B first, it seemed so much easier with Dawn.</p>

<p>“I hurt your mom D. Willow, Xander, Wesley, everyone I touched I hurt. I
was in love with B and I tried to kill Angel and I was so hurt and messed
up. I wanted B but I couldn’t have her, and so in my fucked up head I
somehow reasoned with myself that if I couldn’t be happy, B didn’t deserve
happiness either. I… I’m not like that anymore Dawn.” She looks up at me
when I use her full name, knowing like B does that I only use full names
when I’m dead serious. “I love you and B, and I’d die to protect the two of
you. I’ve never had much in my life. I was the type to scrounge up just
enough to get by, but it never bothered me until now. Now that I have you
two, I’ve got the one thing I’ve always wanted most. I have a family and I
swear I’ll take care of the two of you.” I look in her eyes and find so many
questions that she can’t even find the words to ask. I think I covered the
‘why’ in there somewhere, at least the one about why I did all that horrible
stuff. But there’s one question she’s dying to ask, and I know what it is so
I answer before she gets the chance to ask.</p>

<p>“I just wanted to tell you all that, because I know you really look up to
me, and I don’t want you to ever think I’m someone I’m not or that I’m
better than I really am. When I was a kid, I never had family. I had a drunk
mom and an abusive dad, but that’s not family. Me, you and B, that’s family.
Since I was pretty much treated like shit as a kid, I didn’t know how to
handle people when I got older. I still don’t really, which you saw by me
kissing B in front of Red just because I thought it’d be fun to piss Red
off. I won’t be perfect, but I promise I’ll take care of you and B if you
can forgive me for the things I’ve done.” My eyes sting from the tears that
I refuse to let fall. The memories of the things I did are so vivid even now
that it’s painful to think about it, even though I’m glad for it. I know I
deserve to be pained by them for the rest of my life, however long that may
be. I suppose it’s funny knowing that I can open up to Dawn better than B,
but I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that she’s just a kid.</p>

<p>I start to wonder where B is and when I look over at the door I notice
she’s just standing there with tears streaming down her cheeks. A large lump
forms in my throat knowing that B probably just heard everything I said. I
know she’s already read all this stuff in my journal, but something about
her actually hearing me say it makes it difficult, even though I’m not about
to let on to that. Nope, instead I smile weakly and let out a small laugh.
“Guess that saves me from having to go all emotional again huh?” B nods at
me, knowing better than to say anything about it. It’s one of the things I
love most about her. She might not understand everything about me, but she
knows when to drop stuff and finally learned not to push me.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s get you two hell raisers home.” B says as she wraps an arm
around my waist lending me support as we walk out of the room. My head is
still pounding, but I know thanks to my special healing abilities I'll be
five by five in the morning which is always nice. Besides, the headache I
have now isn't even half as bad as the ones I've gotten from some hangovers.
You'd figure as a slayer we wouldn't have to deal with shit like that but we
do and it sucks. Of course now that I have my new family I won't be doing
any more drinking. There's no way I'd want to put them through what my
mother put me through.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>"Geez B, you got us back to your house quick," I mumble as she wakes me up
in the car. I suppose I dozed off sometime during the trip back.</p>

<p>"Our house you mean," she says with a smile.</p>

<p>When we get inside I make my way over to the couch and lay down, already
falling asleep. Taking hits in the head like I did isn't easy, even if you
are a slayer. Dawn comes in and tells me goodnight and gives me a brief hug
before dissapearing up the stairs.</p>

<p>"You ready to go up to bed?" B asks me softly as she sits on the arm of the
sofa. I guess she noticed my look of confusion because she just shook her
head at me again. "You didn't really think I was going to make you sleep on
the couch did you?" Too tired to speak, the blank look I give her says it
all. "Well your sleeping in my room with me. That is if you wanted," she
blushes a little and I sit up to kiss her softly.</p>

<p>"I'd like that B. Just lead the way," I say standing up. The walk up the
stairs seems to drain all my energy but when we get in her room I manage to
rid myself of my clothes. When B notices her face turns redder than Red's
hair and I can't help but laugh, that is until I notice I'm actually
blushing again. "Sorry B, I guess I'm not used to sleeping with other
people." Yeah, that sounded smooth. Some doof I am huh?</p>

<p>"It's okay," she whispers as she blushes even more. I'm too out of it to
really care, because if there's anything that Sunnydale hospital can do,
it's drug people up. She changes into some cute pj's and crawls into her
bed, motioning for me to lay down. "Come on, I still wanna cuddle with you."</p>

<p>"Your going to show me how to do this cuddling stuff right? Because I've
never done it before," I say as I crawl in next to her under the blankets.
As soon as I'm laying down she pulls me into her arms and kisses my
forehead. "Is this cuddling?" I ask meekly, almost embarassed that I've
never had anyone hold me before.</p>

<p>"Yeah. It's nice huh?" I kiss her neck in response and drape one of my arms
loosely around her stomach.</p>

<p>"I like listening to your heartbeat B," I whisper just seconds before I
fall into the first contented sleep of my life.</p>

<p>Man, I have really missed Sunday morning cartoons. Even better,
there's an X-men marathon on this morning. When B woke up I had to explain
why they're so great. I can't believe she didn't get it. At least she went
to go make breakfast. I could definitely get used to this family stuff.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little bit too old to be watching cartoons?"</p>

<p>Guess I'll have to explain the wonders of X-men to Dawn too. "Come on
Dawnie, it's X-men," I say as I pat the spot on the couch next to me. She
sits and I start explaining all the characters to her. I can't believe
they've never watched this before.</p>

<p>B comes in laughing, and sits down on my lap. "Did you brush your teeth
Dawn?" she asks interrupting me. "You'll be here all day if you let her go
on. I only got out of it because I promised food." She kisses me before
heading back into the kitchen and I stick my tongue out at her.</p>

<p>"So anyways, I learned all I need to know in life from cartoons." I smile
proudly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and it got you far too huh?" I'm not sure what she really meant by
that. Whether she meant my new family and all I have now, or my time in
jail. But being me, I took it to mean the later, and I guess she realized
it. "I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry Faith."</p>

<p>"It's fine," I say, and I can see in her eyes that she didn't really mean
it. That's just how teenagers are. They speak without actually thinking
first. Hell, I still do that most of the time.</p>

<p>I walk into the kitchen to find the most adorable thing I've ever
seen. B's got some music on and she's singing into a big wooden spoon thats
dripping pancake batter.  I walk up behind her and start singing along as I
wrap my arms around her waist.</p>

<p>"Commercial break or something?" she asks as she turns around to kiss me
once more.</p>

<p>"Nah. I'm gonna go out for a walk or something. I need to clear my head." I
sit up on the counter and she looks at me like Miss S used to so I quickly
get down.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" I don't know why, but for some reason what Dawn said to me
really bothered me, and I just need to think. Guess I should tell her that,
but for some reason I don't. Maybe it was to protect Dawn because I'm sure B
wouldn't be happy with her saying that either.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I just wanna go for a walk okay?" She looks a little hurt and I
feel bad in an instant. I'm still not used to that whole care and share
thing. "I'll be back in a while. I love you," I say kissing her quickly.</p>

<p>"I love you too," she smiles at me as I walk out the door.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Somehow I end up at the park. I almost wanted to hit the nearest store and
buy some JD, but I know drinking won't do anything. For a few minutes my
reasoning skills went back to the way they were before jail. Dawn looks at
me like I'm shit, so I show her what shit I can be. But as I learned in
jail, that kind of thinking doesn't get me anywhere. Besides, if anyone
really loves me, it's Dawn and I know she didn't really mean it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how long I've been out and I feel bad because I'm sure B's
worried about me but I don't feel like going back yet. As I turn the corner
into the park, who do I run into other than Red and Blondie. Some luck I
have this morning. Guess there's no time like the present to try and make
amends huh?</p>

<p>"Hey Red, Blondie," I say nodding to the two of them.</p>

<p>"Her name's Tara, and mine's Willow. Or are two syllable words too big for
you?"</p>

<p>"That hurts," I say as I sit down on a bench next to them.</p>

<p>"Yeah well you deserve a lot more than just that." Okay, obviously this is
going to be harder than I thought.</p>

<p>"Look Willow, I'm not here to make trouble. Buffy's the one who wanted me
to come back. For what it's worth, I'm sorry for all the stuff I did."</p>

<p>"It certainly isn't worth much to me." She gets up and holds her hand out
to Tara. You know, the girl is as sweet as can be when she's your friend,
but she's one hell of a bitch when she doesn't like you.</p>

<p>"Personally, I don't give a rat's ass if you like me or not Willow. I just
want us to play nice for B's sake."</p>

<p>"Y-yes you do," finally Tara speaks up. "I can tell you want us to be
friends. It's in your eyes." And all this time I thought B was the only one
who could do that whole knowing what I'm thinking by looking at my eyes
thing. Guess maybe it's a witchy thing too or something.</p>

<p>"Your wrong Tara. Faith has no feelings," Willow takes her girlfriends hand
and tries to get her to stand up but she doesn't.</p>

<p>"I know I didn't go through what everyone else did, but I forgive you."
Tara smiled at me and Willow looked like she was about to explode. Somehow I
manage not to laugh, knowing that wouldn't really help my cause any.</p>

<p>"Thanks Tara. I really do mean it Willow. I'm sorry. Just think about it at
least okay? Now if you don't mind, I gotta make sure B didn't burn the house
down. I hear she isn't much of a cook." I wink at the two of them and walk
off.</p>

<p>Suddenly what Dawn said to me earlier doesn't seem bad. I think the only
reason her remark bothered me was because it was true. But hey, maybe if I
hadn't fucked up so bad I would never have what I do today. Point is,
there's not point in dwelling on the past. I've got a future now and that's
all I need to worry about.</p>

<p>On the way back to B's I pass some little flower shop and decide that a
peace offering is in order. After all, I did skip out on mine and B's first
breakfast together and I hear girls like flowers. I get a dozen red rozes
for B, and notice they've got some orange roses too. I'm not really sure if
they mean anything like red means love, but they're cool so I grab a half
dozen of them for the kid. I guess I ought to get used to spoiling them now,
because even if I end up broke I love seeing them smile.</p>

<p>When I get back home I realize the front door is locked and I'm still
without a key. I've got my hands full, but somehow I manage to ring the
doorbell and Dawn's quickly at the door smiling at me. "Miss me?"</p>

<p>"Are you still mad at me?" she asks and her smile fades. I walk in the
house and just shake my head at her.</p>

<p>"Actually, I was hoping you'd forgive me for taking it the wrong way." I
pull out her flowers from behind my back and I swear I've never seen her
smile so big before. She practically jumps on me and gives me a big bear
hug. "Where's B at?"</p>

<p>"She's in the kitchen cleaning up the breakfast you didn't eat," she pokes
me in the ribs and I notice the evil gleam in her eye.</p>

<p>"I'm in trouble for leaving huh?"</p>

<p>"Yup," she smiles at me then takes off to her room. Let's just hope the
flowers go over as smoothly with B as they did Dawn.</p>

<p>"Uhh... Honey I'm home," I say softly peaking my head into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Hey," she says flatly before turning her attention back to the dishes.</p>

<p>"I brought you something," I walk up behind her and wrap my arms around her
waist holding the roses in front of her. "I'm sorry for taking off this
morning. I just needed to think about something."</p>

<p>"You really want to make it up to me?" She turns around in my arms and I
notice she's got that same evil gleam in her eyes that Dawn did just a few
moments before. They're definitely up to something.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" I half state, half ask unsure of what I'm about to get myself into.</p>

<p>"Well you can start by taking me and Dawn to the mall." She stops and gives
me a quick kiss before she takes off to search the cabinets for a vase.
"Then tonight you can tell my why you took off this morning and we can
finally talk about all that stuff in your journal."</p>

<p>"Guess I don't have much say in the matter do I?" I ask meekly.</p>

<p>"Nope," she smiles at me again and Dawn chooses that moment to walk into
the kitchen. "You ready yet?"</p>

<p>Dawn nods and I just sigh. It's going to be a long day. I can handle the
whole dealing with the past thing tonight, but taking both the Summers girls
to the mall is like murder. What can I say, I'm just not the shopping type.</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 7</td></tr>
</table>

<p>"Come on B, my arms are tired." Yes, I'm actually whining. Wouldn't
you be after spending six hours in the mall with B and Dawn? And not only
have I been drug around all day, I get to hold all the bags. Joy.</p>

<p>"Just because you're done shopping doesn't mean we are," Dawn smiles
sweetly at me as she speaks.  Now I know I really love them, because there's
no way in hell I would do this for anyone else.</p>

<p>Next thing I know I'm being pulled into another store. This one's called
American Eagle or something of the sort and there's nothing but preppy
people in it. Obviously they have no manners because they're all staring at
me like they've never seen a girl in leather pants before. Of course, in
this backwards town it wouldn't surprise me if they hadn't.</p>

<p>"What do you think Dawn?" Buffy looks over at Dawn and holds up some light
blue tank top with the numbers 27 on it. Sure it would bring out her eyes,
and might actually look hot on her if it were tight enough, but I'm not
about to say that.</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm just gonna go wait outside. If looks could kill, these people
would have had me dead the second I walked in here." I go to kiss B, but
then realize we're out in public so I settle for a goofy smile instead. I'm
not one to care what people think about mine and B's relationship, but I
don't think she's comfortable enough with it yet to be showing public
displays of affection.</p>

<p>As I'm walking out of the store I've still got my head turned, refusing to
break the eye contact between B and I. Just my luck, I bump into some blonde
bimbo."Hey," I offer my hand to help her up and she gladly accepts it.
"Sorry about that. Guess I should pay more attention huh?" She just kind of
snorts at me before storming off.</p>

<p>"Anya wait!" I hear Xander yelling from the other end of the mall. I'm
guessing that bimbo is his girl or something. He goes running by me and just
as I start to think I got off the hook, he back tracks and stops right in
front of me.</p>

<p>"You," he says harshly.</p>

<p>"No welcome home hugs?" I ask sarcastically.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you doing here?" Guess these people don't believe in
phones. I figured B would have told the whole gang I was back by now.</p>

<p>"Shopping," I smile and hold up the bags. His eyes narrow to suggest that
he wants more from me than that. "B came and got me cuz I got out of prison.
We made up and stuff ya know? I'm not out to cause more damage if that's
what you're thinking. And I'm sorry for before and all okay?"</p>

<p>"Promise?" He asks as his eyes glance over to where his girl just ran off.</p>

<p>"Sure," I respond trying not to laugh at the situation. He's so nervous he
looks like a five year old that just got caught with their hand in the
cookie jar.</p>

<p>"Good enough for now. I gotta go," he stops and points at where the blonde
he called Anya just ran off to. He quickly sprinted off calling out her name
again. Finally I allow myself to laugh. Poor guy's never had any luck with
women.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" B asks me as her and Dawn step out of the store.</p>

<p>"Looks like the X-man's having some girl problems. As mean as it might
sound I'm kinda glad. Kept him off my back for a while longer. Oh, I forgot
to tell you. I ran into Red and Tara while I was out this morning. This town
is really much too small."</p>

<p>"Yeah it is. So what happened with Willow and Tara?" We start walking again
and she takes some of the bags from me. I might be strong, but I was
struggling with those bags.</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Red still hates me but I apologized and Tara forgave me." I
shrug and finally notice B is leading us out of the mall.</p>

<p>"What about Xander?" Dawn asks.</p>

<p>"I think he was too busy worring about his girl to care much. He made me
promise I was sorry and ran off."</p>

<p>"That's good...I think," B shakes her head. "Come on, lets get home. We've
got a lot of talking to do tonight."</p>

<p>"Sure thing B. Anything to get me out of this damn mall." They both stare
at me and I have a feeling they're going to make me come back to this place
one day. But like I said before, I ain't the shopping type.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>When we got home I was so glad to just sit down. Dawn and B immediatly
start pulling all their crap out and they're making plans to share the
clothes already. Sometimes I wonder if I was really meant to be a girl,
because I really don't understand this stuff.</p>

<p>"What'd you get Faith?" Dawn finally looks up from the pile of clothes
she's sitting under.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Buffy askes her. "Leather pants and tight shirts of
course," she answers for me while rolling her eyes.</p>

<p>"Got 'em just for you B. I know you think I'm sexy in them," I wink at her.
"I'm going to take a shower while you two uhh... Do whatever it is you girls
do." I shake my head as I'm getting up and B just pulls me back down for a
kiss.</p>

<p>"I've wanted to do that all day," she whispers.</p>

<p>I smile at the two of them before heading up the stairs. When I reach the
top I can hear them giggling about something so I sit down on the top step
to listen to them. Gotta love slayer hearing. It's nothing other than just
adorable and I almost wish I had a video camera.</p>

<p>Caring about someone other than myself is still really weird to me. I
always loved B, but I've never really felt like I had to take care of her
before. Now not only do I have to worry about her, I have to worry about
Dawn too. It's awkward when you've always put yourself first, then suddenly
one day you've got two people that mean more than life to you to take care
of.</p>

<p>It's almost like I'm not me anymore. I'm definitely not the same girl I was
before prison. It's a good thing, don't get me wrong but in a way I miss who
I was. This is fun, but there's definitely something to be said for being as
carefree as I used to be. I guess that's what growing up is though.</p>

<p>"Hey, I thought you were going to take a shower?" B questions and I'm
brought out of my thoughts.</p>

<p>"I was, but I guess I kinda got lost in thought," I smile sheepishly at
her.</p>

<p>"I get dibs on the shower then!" Dawn runs up the stairs and blows by me
into the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Geez, I've never seen a kid so glad to shower before."</p>

<p>"Well the sooner she showers, the sooner she gets to put on her new
pyjamas." Buffy says as she sits down beside me on the stairs.</p>

<p>"Is that one of those girl things I don't understand?"</p>

<p>"Could be," she laughs. "So, you up for that little chat now?" I nod at her
and she takes my hand in hers and pulls me up. We walk into her, or our, or
whose ever room it is now and I sprawl out on the bed as she shuts the door
behind us.</p>

<p>"So what's the what B? I thought everything in there was kind of self
explanatory."</p>

<p>"Most of it was, and there's only one thing I really care about." She sits
down straddling my waist and suddenly I'm not so concerned with thoughts of
my journal anymore.</p>

<p>"What do you care about then B?" I sit up and wrap my arms around her,
holding her in place on my lap.</p>

<p>"For one, I care about you," she smiles and gives me a quick kiss. "I'm
past all that happened between us. What I want to talk about is what
happened before we ever knew each other."</p>

<p>I know exactly where this is going and I let my arms fall to my sides as I
lay back down on the bed. "B, I can explain the things I did to you and the
scoobs until I'm blue in the face, but please don't make me talk about my
childhood."</p>

<p>"Your childhood is exactly why you did what you did Faith. That's why you
love Dawn so much isn't it?" she asks softly as her palm caresses my cheek.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I just want to make sure she never has to deal with anything like I
did. No kid deserves that." I look away from her so she doesn't notice the
tears that are threatening my eyes.</p>

<p>"You know you didn't deserve any of that either right?" She makes me look
at her and she wipes the tears from my eyes.</p>

<p>"I do now. I'm just glad I'm a slayer because if I weren't I probably would
have died. Though death was more than welcome back then. After what
happened, after the beatings and my step father raping me, I didn't think
anyone could ever really love me. You proved me wrong B, and I couldn't even
tell you how glad I am you did. I'm still kind of fucked from it. When I get
hurt I still get the urge to go drink like my mom did. Hell, I thought about
it this morning. I'm scared I'll screw up again B. How many chances can you
keep giving me?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that you won't Faith. But you know I could screw up too.
But if it happens, I know how much you love me. I also know you love Dawn.
So if it happens, I'll give you another chance. Whether it takes three,
four, or five chances, I'll never give up on you Faith. I promise. You have
to promise me one thing though."</p>

<p>"Anything B." I whisper sincerely.</p>

<p>"If you ever feel yourself slipping, or if you're hurting you come talk to
me about it. Even if it's just something small like what Dawn said to you
this morning."</p>

<p>"She told you about that huh?" I sit back up and pull B back into my arms
suddenly wanting her as close to me as possible.</p>

<p>"Yeah. After you left she was really scared that you were mad at her so she
told me." B starts running her fingers through my hair and it feels so
relaxing I can't help but yawn.</p>

<p>"I hope she knows I'd never be mad at her. And yeah, I promise B. I won't
just walk off like I did this morning. It's still kind of hard on me though.
I've never trusted anyone before you."</p>

<p>"I know," she whispers as she kisses my forehead. "It's something we'll
work on together. You should probably get some sleep now though. You're
going to have a big day tommorow."</p>

<p>I can't help but smile at that. "You're not making me go back to the mall
are you?" I ask as my eyes narrow just before I start to tickle her.</p>

<p>"No, I'll only make you go once a month. Tommorow we're going to have a
talk with the whole gang and get this all worked out. So rest up." She pulls
herself out of my reach and starts changing into her new pyjamas. I take
that as my cue to strip down, and crawl under the covers.</p>

<p>"Do we get to try that cuddling thing again? I kinda liked that," I pat the
spot on the bed next to me and she eagerly crawls in and lays in my arms.</p>

<p>"Anything for you," she winks at me just before turning off her lamp that's
beside the bed.</p>

<p>"You know I'm going to hold you to that right?" I bend my head forward and
catch her mouth in a tender kiss.</p>

<p>"I look forward to it," she says as we break apart.</p>

<p>"Hey wait, aren't we like supposed to say goodnight to Dawn or something?"
B starts laughing softly, so I'm taking that as a no. "Be nice." I poke her
in the ribs just for good measure. "I'm new to this mommie stuff too."</p>

<p>"And you're doing a great job at it so far. Now go to sleep before I kick
you out and make you sleep on the couch." She pokes me back to let me know
she's just teasing. I don't say anything back and instead my fingers lazily
trace patterns on her back. I watch her as she falls to sleep, and just when
I think I've seen her at her best I realize how wrong I really am. I don't
think she'll ever cease to amaze me.</p>
