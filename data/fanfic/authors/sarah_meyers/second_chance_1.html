<!-- Second Chance \ Story -->

<p align=center>What do you do, when love comes along<br>
And offers your heart a chance to move on<br>
With no guarantees, no safety net<br>
You trust what you feel, you take that first step</p>

<p align=center>Just close your eyes<br>
Reach for the moment,<br>
Before it slips by<br>
Here is your second chance,<br>
Take it, and fly.</p>
