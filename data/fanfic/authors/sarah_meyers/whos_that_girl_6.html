<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 5 -->

<p>When Faith opened her eyes the first thing she did was look around the empty
hospital room, wondering if Buffy had really been there to see her or if it
were all a dream. Could Buffy really have forgiven her and said that she
wanted to be friends again? 'Only one way to find out,' Faith thought to
herself.</p>

<p>After a few minutes she decided it was time to get out of the hospital and
even though her body was still a little shaky after being out of commission
for so long she managed to get out of bed. It didn't take long for her to
find the clothes that she was brought to the hospital in and she changed
back into them even though they were covered in blood stains.</p>

<p>After getting dressed, she noticed she really didn't have that much energy
at all. She placed a hand on the wall to steady herself as she peeked out of
the door to make sure there were no doctors or nurses around to notice her.
When she was sure she could get away with no one spotting her she made her
way out of the hospital as fast as she could.</p>

<p>The second she stepped outside she had to shut her eyes from the sun. After
being in a dark hospital room all comatose for a few months the sun was
blinding to her. She lifted her hand to block the light from her eyes as she
started walking towards the only place she could think of to go for answers.</p>

<hr>

<p>As Buffy sat in class she couldn't seem to stop thinking about Faith.  She
wished she could go back to the days in high school when she would skip
class just to be with Faith. As the life of a slayer goes, college didn't
seem like a necessity to her considering she could die any day and she
didn't really think she would even live long enough to finish school. But
she was doing this for her mother, her watcher, and her friends.</p>

<p>Faith was the only one who could understand the importance of living each
day how you want. Faith was the one who taught her the importance of it as
well. When the two were together, everyone thought Buffy was becoming like
Faith, careless and wild. Only the two slayers knew that Buffy was doing
exactly what she wanted, living for herself and not others for a change.</p>

<p>After Faith killed Finch and turned against her, Buffy had to go back to
being the responsible person everyone wanted her to be. She began to live
her life how everyone else wanted her to, instead of how she wanted to and
she hated Faith for it. Faith was the one who taught her how to 'find the
fun' and then she just abandoned her as soon as something didn't go her way.</p>

<p>She didn't want to hurt Faith, or fight the person she came to regard as
just as much of a best friend as Willow and Xander but she knew she had no
choice. After all, she couldn't just let the world come to an end because
she didn't want to kill Faith. When her and Faith shared the dream and Faith
told her how to defeat the mayor Buffy knew she couldn't hate the brunette
any longer. She knew that deep down Faith was just scared, and alone and
after that she vowed that one day she would make things right again with
Faith.</p>

<p>After what seemed like an eternity to Buffy the bell finally rang but as she
got up to leave the class she heard her teacher calling out to her. "Miss
Summers, if you aren't going to pay attention in my class you might as well
not bother to come anymore." Buffy just nodded at her and rolled her eyes as
she turned around to walk out of the class.</p>

<p>When she got back to her dorm room she crashed onto her bed wondering if
Willow was in a class or not. She moved to lay on her side and she noticed
that the light on their answering machine was blinking. She pressed the
button and listened to the message on it. "Hey Missy, Jan here. Les gave me
your number and I just wanted to tell you that you're insane for not coming
to school with us. There's so many hot girls here, not that you'd care about
that though. Les seems to think there's a lot of cute guys too so you would
have been happy here. Well he's actually making me go to class so I'll talk
to you later. Give us a call sometime. We miss you."</p>

<p>The machine beeped and the next message began. "Missy, you have to call me
as soon as you get this. I'm having a major crisis here. Tryouts just
started and there's this bitch that's even worse than Big Red that's going
after captain. Cliff leave me alone." The message went quiet for a few
seconds then a guy's voice came on. "Hey sis, you better call Torr soon
because she's driving me nuts." It went quiet for a few more seconds and the
girl Buffy now knew was Torrance came back on the phone. "Your brother just
doesn't understand is all. Give me a call soon. Miss ya," the girl said just
before hanging up the phone.</p>

<p>Buffy laughed as she listened to Missy's friends and she began to think
about how homesick Missy must be. Moving away from your home and friends to
come to a place like Sunnydale wasn't easy, and Buffy knew that since she
once had to do it. In the short time that they had known each other Missy
had helped her out a lot, and now Buffy wanted to help Missy become happy in
Sunnydale.</p>

<p>She remembered that she made plans to go out with Willow later but since she
was getting restless from just sitting around she was going to find Willow
now and drag her out. She jotted a quick note to leave for Missy telling her
that she had new messages on the machine even though the light wasn't
flashing on it. As an after thought she told her that her and Willow were
going to the Espresso Pump and if she got bored she should meet them up
there. Buffy placed the note on Missy's pillow hoping the girl would notice
it when she got in and headed out of her room to find her best friend.</p>

<hr>

<p>Faith stood on the porch at Giles house trying to get up the nerve to
actually knock. She knew the watcher would be home, but she was afraid that
Buffy hadn't really been in the hospital to see her. She knew she had
dreamed about Buffy, and she was almost positive that it was a slayer dream
but something in the back of her mind kept telling her that she was crazy
for thinking Buffy would ever want to be friends with her again.</p>

<p>Finally she decided to just go for it, and knocked softly on Giles front
door. When the watcher opened his front door Faith just stood there smiling
at him awkwardly, suddenly unable to speak. "Faith," he said in disbelief.
"You're... awake."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well I finally had a reason to come out of coma land," she told him
shyly. "I know I don't have any right to ask, but do you mind if I come in?
I'm wicked exhausted and I was hoping maybe you could help me find B."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," Giles said as he stepped aside to allow Faith entrance into
his house. "Buffy was by earlier saying she was going to see you. Does she
know that you're awake yet?"</p>

<p>Faith smiled as Giles said that, relieved that it wasn't just a dream. "Nah,
she left before I woke up. I heard her though, when she was there talking to
me and I wanted to wake up for her you know? But she already left when I
woke up."</p>

<p>"Well then I suggest that you stay here until we can find her. You're in no
condition to be roaming about after being in the hospital for the last few
months." Giles said as he sat down.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the concern but I'm five by five Giles. I really want to find B.
I appreciate you being nice to me and everything though, and I'm sorry for
before. I know it's just words, but I really want to try and make everything
up to all of you," Faith said as Giles held out a shirt for her.</p>

<p>"You really should at least change out of that shirt Faith," he told her.
Faith took the shirt and Giles showed her where the bathroom was so she
could change.</p>

<p>When she came back out Giles just smiled at her as he scribbled something
down on a scrap piece of paper. "Earlier I told Buffy that you were a very
strong willed girl, and you've certainly proved that by waking up just for
Buffy so I know you won't take my advice and rest until you've found her."
He stopped and handed her the paper. "Here's the address to her dorm room.
If she's not there I don't know where you'll be able to find her. Just
promise me one thing," Giles said, already concerned about the brunette.
"Don't push yourself too hard. It would do no good for you to be out of your
coma only to push yourself too much and end up back in the hospital."</p>

<p>"I'll try my best G-man. Thanks for trusting me enough to let me come in
and stuff. I promise I'll make it up to you," Faith said with a smile as she
stood up and headed out of the door to find Buffy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy stood outside of Willow's dorm room and knocked on the door hoping
that her best friend would be there. When Willow answered the door she was
relieved and walked into the room that looked exactly like hers and Missy's.
"How come your here so early? I thought you were going to wait for me to
call you," Willow said as she walked past her friend and sat down on her
bed.</p>

<p>"I know but I got bored. I figured we could go grab Oz and just head to the
Espresso Pump now." Buffy looked at the Dingos Ate My Baby poster that
Willow had taped to the wall and smiled at her friend. "You up for it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, just give me a minute to get some different clothes on." Willow
rummaged through her things and changed while Buffy inspected her room. Upon
seeing all the unpacked boxes in the room it reminded her that she needed to
get the rest of her things from home.</p>

<p>"Hey, can we stop by my mom's later so I can pick up some more of my stuff
too?" Buffy asked right after Willow announced that she was ready to leave.
The red head just nodded at her as the two walked out of the dorm room.</p>

<p>The two walked to Oz's in a comfortable silence until Willow noticed that
Buffy seemed unusually happy. "What's with you?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" Buffy asked sounding confused as her thoughts of Faith were
temporarily forgotten once again.</p>

<p>"You just seem extra peppy today. Have a good first day at school or
something?"</p>

<p>Buffy's smile grew after her friends question, and she wished that she could
tell her friend about why she was in such a good mood. She wanted to tell
them more than anything, but she wanted to be sure she was able to trust
Faith before she put her friends through that. Since she believed Faith was
still in a coma she didn't think there was any rush to tell them. "It was
pretty good I guess. How about yours?"</p>

<p>"It was fine until I got to my second class. Your roommate Missy is in there
with me." Willow said, sounding a little annoyed as she remembered that
Missy told her she should get over what Faith did.</p>

<p>"That's a bad thing?" Buffy asked seemingly dissapointed.</p>

<p>"Well it would have been fine if she didn't butt into my life and tell me
that I should forgive Faith." Just as Willow said that the two arrived at
Oz's and Willow rang the doorbell. "I mean, who could actually forgive
Faith?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I can," Buffy said softly, but her response went unnoticed by her best
friend since Oz chose to answer the door at the same time she spoke and
Willow wasn't even paying attention to her. She let out a soft sigh as it
finally sunk into her head that bringing Faith back into her life was going
to be a lot harder than she had expected it to be.</p>

<hr>

<p>When Faith reached the campus of UC Sunnydale a huge grin spread across her
face. It didn't take her too long to find the hall where Buffy's room was
and she noticed her energy reserves were severly running low as she climbed
the stairs to Buffy's dorm room. Her stomach growled loudly to remind her
that hospitals don't feed their patients well at all. She glanced back down
at the paper Giles gave to her and then up at the number on the door in
front of her.</p>

<p>'Finally,' she thought to herself as she saw that the two numbers were the
same. Faith quickly knocked on the door before she lost her nerve to even do
so and waited for what she hoped to be a friendly reunion. What she didn't
expect however was for the door to open and her double to be standing there
staring right back at her.</p>

<p>The two girls continued to look at each other for the next several
minutes.Missy was the first to recover since she had already seen a picture
of Faith and knew how alike the two looked. "You must be Faith," she said as
a small smile formed on her lips. "I kind of thought you were..."</p>

<p>"Living it up as a veggie in coma land?" Faith finished for her. "I sort of
woke up like an hour or so ago." Faith too smiled a smile that matched
Missy's exactly. "B told me that her roommate looked like me but damn."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's pretty weird. So does she know your awake?" Missy asked as she
motioned for Faith to enter the room. Faith gladly complied and walked into
the dorm wondering just how things could be going so smoothly for her.</p>

<p>"Nah, I was still out of it when she came to see me, but I heard her talking
to me and I just kind of woke up. I guess it's because I'm a..." Faith
stopped herself before she said 'slayer' unsure of if the girl actually knew
about her and Buffy.</p>

<p>"A what? You mean slayer?" Missy asked Faith who just nodded at her. "I'm
Missy by the way," she said as she held out her hand to Faith. The two girls
shook hands and Missy went to sit down on her bed. "Buffy's not here now.
She left me a note saying that her and that girl Willow are going to some
place called the Espresso Pump or something. You're welcome to stay until
she gets back though," Missy offered.</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I think I'll go find her there. I'm a little eager to see her
and tell her I'm sorry and stuff," Faith said as she stood by the door
awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I don't know if that's a good idea. That girl Willow doesn't seem very fond
of you from what I can tell from her reaction to me just looking like you."</p>

<p>"So how come your being so nice to me?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Because I can tell that Buffy really cares about you and I have no reason
to be anything but nice to you," Missy told her. "You know, Buffy did invite
me to meet them there. You could always go there and just say that you're
me, and then pull Buffy aside and tell her that it's you." Missy said with a
wicked smile. "Unless you really want to deal with Willow."</p>

<p>Faith laughed at what Missy told her and sat down on Buffy's bed, already
feeling more comfortable around the new girl. "You know, I like the way you
think."</p>

<p>"Of course, they've pointed out several times that we dress differently, so
if you show up in those leather pants they'll know it's not me."</p>

<p>"Well I don't really have anything else but leather pants to wear," Faith
said and Missy's smile just grew larger. "Wait, are you suggesting I wear
your clothes?" Missy nodded as she got up from her bed and reached into her
dresser to pull out a pair of her jeans for Faith. "Oh hell no! Those are so
not me. I'm not that eager to see Buffy," Faith told her as she crossed her
arms like a stubborn child.</p>

<p>"Yeah you are, so put them on already." Missy tossed the pair of tight jeans
to Faith and turned her back to her.</p>

<p>She heard Faith grumbling but Faith still put on the jeans though she didn't
really want to. "What makes you so sure I want to see B that bad?" she asked
as she finished pulling the jeans on.</p>

<p>"Your changing aren't you?" Missy pointed out. She heard Faith laughing from
behind her and in that moment she decided she really liked the girl, even if
she was an ex psycho.</p>

<p>"So, how do I look?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Perfect. Now go find her," Missy commanded. Faith threw her pants onto
Buffy's bed and Missy told her to just leave them there since she'd look
silly walking around with pants in her hands.</p>

<p>"Thanks for being nice to me I guess," Faith mumbled.</p>

<p>"Like I said, I haven't got any reason to be anything but nice and help you
out. If you ever need anything, you know where to find me."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I'll bring the pants back soon." Faith gave Missy one last
smile before heading out the door, hoping that this time she'd actually be
able to find Buffy.</p>

<p>When Missy closed the door behind Faith she immediately got on the phone and
dialed Les' number. "Please be there," she said to herself.</p>

<p>"Hello?"</p>

<p>"Les! You're actually there," Missy said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Missy! You're actually calling me," he said mockingly.</p>

<p>"Funny. I need your help with something," she told him seriously.</p>

<p>"If you want me to do your homework for you, I can't," he relpied as he
started laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm being serious Les. I need to know how to make two people realize
they're in love with each other."</p>

<p>"Huh?" he asked confused as to why Missy would need to know something like
that already.</p>

<p>"Okay, I guess I should start from the begining here. But listen to me
because this is really important," Missy said as she began to tell him of
Buffy and Faith leaving out the vamire and demon parts knowing that he
wouldn't believe her unless he actually saw it for himself.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Well at least we all have psychology together tommorow," Buffy said, trying
to get Willow off the subject of Missy being in her science class.</p>

<p>"What do think our teacher will be like?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Buffy shrugged. The little bell on the door at the Espresso
Pump went off and Buffy looked behind Willow and Oz and noticed her roommate
walking in. Her eyes went wide as she remembered inviting Missy to meet them
up there. She hadn't expected Willow to loathe her so much. "Uhh guys,
Missy's here," Buffy said sheepishly.</p>

<p>Willow turned to look behind her and saw the girl walking towards them with
a smile on her face. She rolled her eyes as she turned back around to face
Buffy. "Come on Wills, just give her a chance for me?" Buffy asked with
puppy dog eyes.</p>

<p>"Fine, I'll be nice and try to make friends with her," Willow said.</p>

<p>As Faith walked closer to the group she saw Buffy smiling at her and she
felt as if her heart would burst. Of course she knew Buffy thought it was
Missy she was smiling at, but it's more than she ever expected in the first
place. "Hey B...uffy," Faith said, catching her mistake in calling her 'B'
before anyone noticed. Or at least she hoped.</p>

<p>Buffy patted the seat next to her and Faith sat down smiling. Buffy finally
realized that her slayer senses were going off like crazy, giving her that
warm, fuzzy feeling she always got when Faith was around but she figured
they must be off since Faith was in a coma still.</p>

<p>Oz however trusted his instincts and knew it was Faith the moment she sat
down in front of them. He knew his sense of smell had never let him down
before, and he trusted that it was right now. He didn't say anything knowing
how his girlfriend would react to it so he kept quiet while he waited for
Buffy to figure it out.</p>

<p>"Damn, I forgot my money," Faith said trying to think of a way to get Buffy
away from Willow and Oz.</p>

<p>Buffy laughed at her and stood up. "Come on up to the counter with me and
I'll buy you something," she offered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Faith asked, almost enjoying pretending to be Missy. She
could only hope that Buffy would still be this nice when she realized who it
really was. The blonde nodded in response and Faith stood up and walked off
with Buffy to go get her drink.</p>

<p>After ordering her drink and some sort of pastry, Faith leaned against the
counter and smiled at Buffy. When Buffy noticed she looked at her curiously.
"Why are you looking at me like that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I...I..." Faith stuttered, trying to find the right words to say to Buffy.
"Damn B," she said unable to come up with anything else.</p>

<p>"Faith?" Buffy asked as she went wide eyed.</p>

<p>Faith only nodded at her, still afraid of what her reaction might be. "Sorry
I pretended to be Missy. It was kind of her idea." Faith said in a small
voice. Buffy only shook her head at the taller girl, not caring about the
'how' or 'why' of it and she did the only thing she could think of. She
threw herself into Faith's arms and pulled her into the tightest hug she'd
ever given anyone in her life.</p>
