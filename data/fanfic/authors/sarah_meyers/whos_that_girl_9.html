<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 8 -->

<p>Missy finally left Willow's room after a very long discussion with the red
head. It had never occurred to her that Willow would feel threatened by
Faith not because she thought that she might be physically harmed, but
because she thought that Faith would take her best friend from her. When she
entered her room to find Buffy sitting on her bed a plan formed in her mind.
"Get up," Missy said as she walked up to the blonde slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy hardly registered her roommate's words as she once again found herself
lost in thought. "Buffy, get up," she repeated. "You gotta go see Willow."</p>

<p>"I will later. I'm not in the mood to grovel right now."</p>

<p>"Aww, poor Buffy feels sorry for herself. What's with this whole damn town
feeling sorry for themselves?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we all just have a lot on our minds," Buffy snapped.</p>

<p>"Tear. I'm heartbroken. Now go."</p>

<p>"Why?" Buffy asked, not really liking the way her friend was speaking to
her.</p>

<p>"Because I just spent a lot of time talking Willow into forgiving you, and
giving Faith another chance and if you don't go talk to her soon then all my
effort will be put to waste."</p>

<p>"Huh? How did you…?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. Just go talk to her."</p>

<p>Buffy stood from her bed with a smile on her face. She didn't know how the
girl did it, but she must be one hell of a talker if she can get Willow to
cave that easily. "Thanks," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Don’t sweat it. Just tell me where I can find Faith." Missy replied, hoping
that things would go as smoothly as she hoped they would.</p>

<p>"Well it's kinda dark now so I'd say she's probably hanging around some
graveyard. And I highly suggest you don't go out there trying to find her,"
Buffy said worried about her friends safety.</p>

<p>"I'll be fine. Just meet us at the Bronze in like…an hour or so okay?"</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes narrowed as she saw Missy's smile. "What are you up to?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Now get out of here before Willow goes somewhere and you can't
find her. Remember, Bronze- one hour." Missy decided to leave Buffy with
that and she set off to find Faith.</p>

<hr>

<p>Xander stood from his bed and began to put his clothes back on as he watched
Anya do the same. "I think I'm over you now," she said as she pulled her
shirt over her head.</p>

<p>"Um, okay," Xander replied.</p>

<p>"Okay!?" Anya asked, obviously upset that he was okay with it.</p>

<p>"Not okay?" He said, hoping to calm the girl down. He really had no idea of
what she wanted, and started to think that maybe all women were that
confusing. He was at least grateful for the distraction from Faith.</p>

<p>"Good, because we have parts that interlock so well together, I think we
should do that again," she told him with a hungry smile.</p>

<p>"Later Anya. I'm a man, not a God. I need at least a small recovery period.
I'm going to the Bronze for a while. You coming?"</p>

<p>"Can we interlock bodies there?"</p>

<p>"No, we can only do that when no one is around. We dance, and drink there.
Remember? Have other kinds of fun."</p>

<p>"Can we interlock after going to the Bronze?"</p>

<p>"Sure, let's just go," he answered her as he tugged on her hand and pulled
her out of his room. He stopped in front of a mirror to check his clothing
one last time before leaving his house.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Will," Buffy said softly as her best friend let her into her dorm room.
"I thought maybe we could talk for a while, then maybe go Bronzing in a
while if you're up to it?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you have a seat Buffy," Willow said as she went to sit down
herself. Buffy nodded and sat down on Willow's bed facing her best friend.</p>

<p>"Missy said that you two talked, but she didn't tell me what about. I'm
sorry if I hurt you Wills. I just can't give up on Faith."</p>

<p>Willow held up her hand and shook her head so Buffy stopped talking. "Let me
go first okay?" Buffy nodded and placed her hand over Willow's. "When Missy
came by here, we had a really long talk about everything. She made a really
good argument, and I'm starting to wonder if she should become a lawyer or
something." Willow let out a small laugh at that which caused Buffy to relax
since she realized that her and Willow wouldn't have to fight about this.</p>

<p>"She told me that if you were really my best friend, I'd trust you and your
decision on letting Faith back into all of our lives. When I tried to remind
her of how dangerous Faith was in the past she made me realize that you'd
never let her hurt us again."</p>

<p>"It's true Willow. I've messed up in the past and gotten all of you hurt, by
Faith and Angelus but you know I'd rather die than let anyone hurt my
friends. I'd do anything to protect you, even if it were Faith that was
trying to hurt you. I'd never let her do it again. But I can assure you that
she wouldn't even think about something like that now."</p>

<p>"Well I don't really believe that yet, but I'm willing to give her a chance
to prove it. It just hurt Buffy, because it's always like you choose her
over me. Like I'm not as important."</p>

<p>"That's not how it is Willow. You're one of the most important people in my
life. You've been my best friend for a few years now, and you'll always be
important to me. It's just different with Faith. Maybe because we're both
slayers, but it's like she's a part of me and I just can't give up on her.
No one could ever replace my Wills though," Buffy said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Now give me a hug," Buffy told her, and the two proceeded to
embrace each other. "So everything's okay with us and Faith being back?"
Buffy asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yeah, for now. But if she screws up-"</p>

<p>"You can do some scary magic stuff to her. Promise I won't stop ya." The two
best friends stood up and smiled at each other, glad to be on even ground
again. "So you up for some fun at the Bronze?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but only if we can go get my Oz first." Buffy nodded and the two best
friends walked out of the room, arm in arm with matching smiles on their
faces.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Okay, this is starting to border along the lines of creepy," Missy said
aloud even though she was by herself. She walked through Restfield Cemetery
with wide eyes, hoping she could find the brunette slayer before another
vampire found her. She heard a twig snap behind her and she spun around to
face the direction where the sound came from. The cross necklace Buffy gave
to her was being held in a death grip in front of her to scare off a
vampire, or at least slow him down if it had been one.</p>

<p>"It's wicked dangerous to be out here at night you know, unless you have a
death wish or something," Faith said, startling Missy.</p>

<p>"I had to find you. We've got to get to the Bronze."</p>

<p>"Is something wrong?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. You're a dumbass and you're going to tell Buffy how you feel
tonight."</p>

<p>Faith let out a hearty laugh at that and just stared at Missy. She couldn't
believe someone actually had the nerve to call her a dumbass, but it felt
good to know that there was actually someone who wasn't afraid of her.  "I
may be a dumbass, but I'm one with good intentions. Ruining B's life isn't
one of them."</p>

<p>"Well then I suggest you tell her how you feel then, or you will. I put
forth a lot of effort today and you are coming with me whether you like it
or not."  Missy grabbed Faith's hand and tried to pull her along but she
quickly noticed that she couldn't even make Faith budge.</p>

<p>"Slayer strength. Can't get enough of it ya know?" Faith teased.</p>

<p>"Fine, I can't make you go if you don't want. You're only hurting yourself
and Buffy. I talked Willow into giving you another chance you know. I've got
her and Buffy meeting us at the Bronze, and I suggest you come."</p>

<p>"I'll go, but it doesn't mean that I'm telling B how I feel about her."
Faith began walking towards the Bronze and Missy walked by her side.</p>

<p>"At least tell her that you're leaving. If she lets you go, then I won't
ever bother you about this again."</p>

<p>"My leaving or not isn't B's choice to make. I've gotta go whether she wants
me to or not."</p>

<p>"Right, oh already completely whipped one," Missy responded with a laugh.
Faith glared at her, but Missy just made a face at her and laughed harder.</p>

<hr>

<p>"See Anya, people can have fun without interlocking," Xander said as he
pointed out all the couples on the dance floor.</p>

<p>"Yeah but interlocking is so much more fun. Can't we go back to your place
now?" Anya whined.</p>

<p>"Not yet, it's still too early. Hey, look it's my favorite slayer, wolf and
hacker," Xander pointed to the trio as they made their way into the Bronze.
It didn't take long for Buffy and Willow to reach their usual table up by
the stage and join Xander and Anya. "So I take it you two made up?" Xander
questioned due to the fact that last time he saw Willow she seemed to be
furious with her best friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah, we're still bestest buds," Willow said proudly. Xander nodded his
approval, glad to see that everything worked out for them.</p>

<p>"What about you Xander? Are you okay with the Faith thing?" Buffy asked, a
pleading look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Who's Faith? She's not Xander's orgasm friend is she?" Anya questioned as
she looked at the gang.</p>

<p>Xander's eyes went wide in shock again, and he stood up. "I think I'm going
to go get something to drink," he announced before taking off. Anya wasn't
even two seconds behind him, calling out his name while she followed him.</p>

<p>"I thought she was gone?" Oz wondered out loud.</p>

<p>"Buffy?"</p>

<p>The blonde turned to where the now familiar voice was coming from and
smiled. "Hey Parker," she replied.</p>

<p>"I was wondering if you'd maybe dance with me?" He asked almost shyly.</p>

<p>Buffy looked hesitant, knowing that Faith and Missy would probably show up
at any time. "Go for it Buffy," Willow said encouraging her. "If they show
up we'll entertain them."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you're okay with that?" Willow and Oz both said they were so
Buffy took Parker's preoffered hand and let him lead her to the dance floor.
She found it strange that as she looked at Parker now the only thing she
could think of was Faith's earlier statement about starting a relationship
with 'someone old'.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I can't do this," Faith said as she tried to turn around and walk out of
the Bronze.</p>

<p>"Yes you can, and you will," Missy told Faith as she stopped the slayer from
leaving.</p>

<p>"But she's dancing with that guy. And everyone's here. They all hate me."</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe not. But you don't want them to hate you do you?" Faith shook
her 'no' and Missy gave her a knowing smile. "The only way they'll like you
more is if you talk to them. Apologize and try to be nice. The hardest part
is already over."</p>

<p>"What about B? She's having fun with that jerk over there." Missy started
walking towards the gang and Faith hesitantly followed behind her.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about her, I've got it covered. Just remember you owe me big
time when you get your girl."</p>

<p>Faith didn't even get a chance to respond to what Missy told her because she
notice that Willow and Oz had spotted her. She remembered the red head's
warning about not coming around so she held her hands up in the air, as if
she were about to be arrested. "I come in peace?" she offered, hoping that
Willow would let her hang around.</p>

<p>"You don't have to worry about us," Willow said as Faith and Missy sat down.
"I think it's safe to say that we can all get along now, I think."</p>

<p>"What about X-man? He gonna try to skin me alive when he comes back over
here?" Faith questioned, almost seriously.</p>

<p>"You're safe, really." Missy said. "I'm going to get Buffy. Faith's got
something she wants to tell everyone."</p>

<p>Faith's jaw dropped as she looked at Missy. "Everyone my ass! I agreed to
tell Buffy, not all of them."</p>

<p>"Oops, so sorry." Missy gave Faith a wicked smile and walked to the dance
floor to retrieve the blonde. "Mind if I cut in here?" Missy shouted out
loud enough to be heard over the loud music and get Buffy's attention. Buffy
stopped dancing and looked at her, while Parker's smile grew and he stepped
closer to Missy. "It's her I want buddy, not you." She put her hand on his
chest to stop him and turned around to start dancing with the blonde.</p>

<p>"Never knew you wanted me," Buffy teased as she started dancing with Missy,
leaving a rejected Parker to watch them.</p>

<p>"I don't, but Faith does. She's got this idea about leaving, and I just
wanted to tell you before hand that if you let her go you'll be the biggest
idiot in the world."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped dead in her tracks and looked at Missy slack jawed. Missy took
that as her que and grabbed Buffy's hand to lead her back to the table.
Buffy didn't offer any protest and let herself be led back to the gang.</p>

<p>"Hey," Faith said softly to Buffy when she got close enough.</p>

<p>Buffy just smiled at her and sat down next the brunette. Almost out of
instinct she reached for Faith's hand under the table and felt her self
relax a little as their fingers entwined. Faith swallowed hard, realizing
how hard it really would be to leave Buffy right after they just made up.</p>

<p>"So Faith," Missy prompted, trying to get Faith to tell the gang about her
wanting to leave.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we wait for Xander to get back?" Faith asked, trying her best to
stall.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Willow asked as she looked from Missy to Faith.</p>

<p>"Tell 'em Faith."</p>

<p>"I...I'm leaving tomorrow." After that Faith felt Buffy squeezing her hand
tighter, but she didn't dare look at the blonde. "The only way I can make up
for the things I did is if I turn myself into jail for killing the people I
did. I don't want to go, but it's the only way to redeem myself." Even
though she couldn't bring herself to look at the blonde she let her thumb
softly stroke the back of Buffy's hand in as much comfort as she could
offer.</p>

<p>Oz nodded, and looked like he was about to say something but Willow spoke
before he got the chance. "Are you sure? I mean, I know I'm not your biggest
fan or anything but you'd be able to redeem yourself a lot better by
like...fighting vampires and saving lives than behind bars."</p>

<p>"It's for the best Red. For all of you if you don't have to see me again. I
gotta go, I've got some plans to make." Faith stood from the table still
holding Buffy's hand in hers and nodded to the group. She knew if she looked
at Buffy she wouldn't be able to leave so she let go of her hand and walked
out of the Bronze without stopping to look back.</p>

<p>"You are an idiot," Missy told Buffy coldly.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I can feel that way about her though," was Buffy's sad
reply. "There wasn't enough time to figure it out."</p>

<p>"You love her. Do you need me to spell it out for you? All this time I
thought it was just a joke about blondes being dense, but you just proved
it's true. I hope you enjoy living your life wondering what could have been
if you would have stopped her from going." Missy got up and walked away from
the table noticing that Buffy looked like she were about to cry. Willow was
looking at her with an expression of shock. She knew it was not only from
the fact that she just said Buffy was in love with Faith, but that she would
even talk that way to Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at Willow, her eyes begging for her best friend to tell her
what she should do. "You love her?" the red head asked even though she could
see the answer in Buffy's sad eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think I might."</p>

<p>"Then go," Willow said, not even having to think about it.</p>

<p>"How do you feel about it?" Buffy questioned, seeking the approval of her
friend.</p>

<p>"What I feel doesn't matter now. Even if I don't understand it, I'm not the
one who's going to hurt over it. Plus, it's not like I could judge you for
it since there was that whole kinda gay evil me thing before."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and smiled at her friends. "I'll see you guys tomorrow. Tell
Xander I said bye." Buffy searched around the Bronze and saw Missy, who was
watching her from across the room. She flashed her a smile before making her
exit, hoping that she would be able to find Faith.</p>

<p>Missy let herself smile proudly as she watched Buffy leave. Things hadn't
gone as smooth as she planned, but they went and now she could move on to
better things. Like finding someone for herself for example.</p>

<p>"Where did Buffy go?" Parker asked as he walked up to Missy.</p>

<p>The brunette just rolled her eyes at him. "What, do I look like her mother
or something?" And with that she walked back to the table where her new
friends were, leaving Parker out to dry once again.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Stupid, stupid, stupid," Faith muttered over and over again to herself as
she threw some clothes in an old book bag. She had gone back to the old
apartment the mayor got her in hopes that she'd be able to find some of her
old things to take with her to LA. She vaguely noticed that the place had
been fixed up again  and that there were a few things laying around that
weren't there before but she didn't bother to look around. All she wanted
was to get what she needed and leave.</p>

<p>"Going somewhere?"</p>

<p>'Fuck, why is she doing this,' was the first thing Faith thought when she
heard Buffy's voice behind her. She hadn't expected the blonde to come after
her at all. "You know I am. How'd you find me?" Faith asked as she walked
into her closet to grab a few shirts.</p>

<p>"Well I didn't want to waste time searching the whole town so I called the
psychic friends network and asked them." Buffy joked and tried to get closer
to Faith, but the brunette just walked past her as if she weren't even
there. "Just stop and look at me Faith."</p>

<p>"I can't B. I gotta leave and I can't do that if I look at you."</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed Faith's arm and used her free hand to lift Faith's chin up.
"Open your eyes," she commanded. When Faith didn't do anything Buffy shook
her head. "Please Faith, I need you to look at me."</p>

<p>Cautiously, Faith opened her eyes and saw Buffy's looking right back at her.
"Why are you doing this B?"</p>

<p>"What do you see Faith?" Buffy questioned as she let her hand go from
holding Faith's arm down to holding her hand.</p>

<p>"I see you B," Faith replied, sounding confused. Buffy let out a small laugh
at Faith's perplexed expression.</p>

<p>"Look harder," Buffy whispered as she moved a little closer to Faith.</p>

<p>"Your eyes?" Faith tried again.</p>

<p>"What's in them?" Buffy questioned almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I...I don't know B."</p>

<p>"It's sadness Faith," Buffy told her. "I can't let you leave. Stay, or else
it'll never go away." Buffy reached her hand up to push a few strands of
hair behind Faith's ear.</p>

<p>"What about the cops? They'll be after me now that I'm out of a coma." Faith
now found that her and Buffy were even closer together and her heart started
beating faster as she found it harder and harder to talk.</p>

<p>"We'll find a way. Just stay. I need you to stay." Faith could only nod, all
her resolve melting into nothing as she felt Buffy wrap her arms around her
waist. When she felt Buffy resting her head on her shoulder Faith let
herself embrace the blonde. "Don't ever leave Faith. Let Sunnydale be your
home," Buffy said softly.</p>

<p>Faith only smiled as she let herself stroke the blonde's hair. "Sunnydale
can never be my home B."</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at her, hoping that she wasn't still going to leave. "Why
Faith?"</p>

<p>Faith pulled away from Buffy and sat down on her old bed and held Buffy's
hands in her own as she smiled up at her. "Sunnydale is just a place to rest
my head. It's a place to spend my days and nights but it'll never be home.
I've never had a home before, just a place to 'hang my hat' as they say. But
that changed the day I met you. You're my home B. No, you're not a place
where I live but if home is where the heart is, then you're it."</p>

<p>"Faith," Buffy managed to choke out even though there was an incredible lump
in her throat after hearing what Faith just said to her. "If I wasn't
positive before, I know for sure now. I love you."</p>

<p>Faith felt as if her heart could beat out of her chest when Buffy said that
and she stood back up and placed her palm on Buffy's cheek. "I love you too
B." Faith let her thumb lightly brush over Buffy's bottom lip and quickly
replaced it with her lips in a whisper of a kiss still afraid that Buffy
might not want the same thing she did. When she felt Buffy's hand around her
neck pulling her closer she knew it was okay and deepened the kiss with the
blonde.</p>

<p>When the two pulled apart Faith just held Buffy in her arms, fighting back
the tears of happiness that she wanted to cry. She didn't believe she ever
did anything in her life to deserve this, but she knew she'd spend what was
left of it making Buffy happy. "Let's go," Faith said softly. She didn't
really want to spend her first night with Buffy back at the dorm where Missy
would be, but the apartment still carried too many bad memories for both of
them.</p>

<p>"Let's go to my mom's," Buffy told her. "I know we'll have to deal with her
and all, but at least we'll be able to be alone there once we get past her."</p>

<p>"The fun never stops with you," Faith joked.</p>

<p>"Damn straight," Buffy retorted as she gave Faith a quick kiss.</p>

<p>"Actually, neither of us are really straight now," Faith said with a smile.</p>

<p>Buffy just shook her head as Faith grabbed the book bag from her old bed. "A
smartass is what you are," Buffy told her with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Funny you should say that since Missy told me I was a dumbass earlier. You
people need to get your stories straight."</p>

<p>"But I thought we weren't straight," Buffy teased, glad to continue the
banter as the two left the apartment. They could deal with the memories from
that place at another time, but now wasn't it.</p>

<p>"You like trying to confuse me don't you?" Faith smiled as Buffy slipped her
hand into hers and they walked down the street, perfectly content and happy.
At least for the next few minutes until Faith had to face Buffy's mom.</p>
