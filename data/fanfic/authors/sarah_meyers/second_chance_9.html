<!-- Second Chance \ Part 7 -->

<p>"Come on B, my arms are tired." Yes, I'm actually whining. Wouldn't
you be after spending six hours in the mall with B and Dawn? And not only
have I been drug around all day, I get to hold all the bags. Joy.</p>

<p>"Just because you're done shopping doesn't mean we are," Dawn smiles
sweetly at me as she speaks.  Now I know I really love them, because there's
no way in hell I would do this for anyone else.</p>

<p>Next thing I know I'm being pulled into another store. This one's called
American Eagle or something of the sort and there's nothing but preppy
people in it. Obviously they have no manners because they're all staring at
me like they've never seen a girl in leather pants before. Of course, in
this backwards town it wouldn't surprise me if they hadn't.</p>

<p>"What do you think Dawn?" Buffy looks over at Dawn and holds up some light
blue tank top with the numbers 27 on it. Sure it would bring out her eyes,
and might actually look hot on her if it were tight enough, but I'm not
about to say that.</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm just gonna go wait outside. If looks could kill, these people
would have had me dead the second I walked in here." I go to kiss B, but
then realize we're out in public so I settle for a goofy smile instead. I'm
not one to care what people think about mine and B's relationship, but I
don't think she's comfortable enough with it yet to be showing public
displays of affection.</p>

<p>As I'm walking out of the store I've still got my head turned, refusing to
break the eye contact between B and I. Just my luck, I bump into some blonde
bimbo."Hey," I offer my hand to help her up and she gladly accepts it.
"Sorry about that. Guess I should pay more attention huh?" She just kind of
snorts at me before storming off.</p>

<p>"Anya wait!" I hear Xander yelling from the other end of the mall. I'm
guessing that bimbo is his girl or something. He goes running by me and just
as I start to think I got off the hook, he back tracks and stops right in
front of me.</p>

<p>"You," he says harshly.</p>

<p>"No welcome home hugs?" I ask sarcastically.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you doing here?" Guess these people don't believe in
phones. I figured B would have told the whole gang I was back by now.</p>

<p>"Shopping," I smile and hold up the bags. His eyes narrow to suggest that
he wants more from me than that. "B came and got me cuz I got out of prison.
We made up and stuff ya know? I'm not out to cause more damage if that's
what you're thinking. And I'm sorry for before and all okay?"</p>

<p>"Promise?" He asks as his eyes glance over to where his girl just ran off.</p>

<p>"Sure," I respond trying not to laugh at the situation. He's so nervous he
looks like a five year old that just got caught with their hand in the
cookie jar.</p>

<p>"Good enough for now. I gotta go," he stops and points at where the blonde
he called Anya just ran off to. He quickly sprinted off calling out her name
again. Finally I allow myself to laugh. Poor guy's never had any luck with
women.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" B asks me as her and Dawn step out of the store.</p>

<p>"Looks like the X-man's having some girl problems. As mean as it might
sound I'm kinda glad. Kept him off my back for a while longer. Oh, I forgot
to tell you. I ran into Red and Tara while I was out this morning. This town
is really much too small."</p>

<p>"Yeah it is. So what happened with Willow and Tara?" We start walking again
and she takes some of the bags from me. I might be strong, but I was
struggling with those bags.</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Red still hates me but I apologized and Tara forgave me." I
shrug and finally notice B is leading us out of the mall.</p>

<p>"What about Xander?" Dawn asks.</p>

<p>"I think he was too busy worring about his girl to care much. He made me
promise I was sorry and ran off."</p>

<p>"That's good...I think," B shakes her head. "Come on, lets get home. We've
got a lot of talking to do tonight."</p>

<p>"Sure thing B. Anything to get me out of this damn mall." They both stare
at me and I have a feeling they're going to make me come back to this place
one day. But like I said before, I ain't the shopping type.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>When we got home I was so glad to just sit down. Dawn and B immediatly
start pulling all their crap out and they're making plans to share the
clothes already. Sometimes I wonder if I was really meant to be a girl,
because I really don't understand this stuff.</p>

<p>"What'd you get Faith?" Dawn finally looks up from the pile of clothes
she's sitting under.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" Buffy askes her. "Leather pants and tight shirts of
course," she answers for me while rolling her eyes.</p>

<p>"Got 'em just for you B. I know you think I'm sexy in them," I wink at her.
"I'm going to take a shower while you two uhh... Do whatever it is you girls
do." I shake my head as I'm getting up and B just pulls me back down for a
kiss.</p>

<p>"I've wanted to do that all day," she whispers.</p>

<p>I smile at the two of them before heading up the stairs. When I reach the
top I can hear them giggling about something so I sit down on the top step
to listen to them. Gotta love slayer hearing. It's nothing other than just
adorable and I almost wish I had a video camera.</p>

<p>Caring about someone other than myself is still really weird to me. I
always loved B, but I've never really felt like I had to take care of her
before. Now not only do I have to worry about her, I have to worry about
Dawn too. It's awkward when you've always put yourself first, then suddenly
one day you've got two people that mean more than life to you to take care
of.</p>

<p>It's almost like I'm not me anymore. I'm definitely not the same girl I was
before prison. It's a good thing, don't get me wrong but in a way I miss who
I was. This is fun, but there's definitely something to be said for being as
carefree as I used to be. I guess that's what growing up is though.</p>

<p>"Hey, I thought you were going to take a shower?" B questions and I'm
brought out of my thoughts.</p>

<p>"I was, but I guess I kinda got lost in thought," I smile sheepishly at
her.</p>

<p>"I get dibs on the shower then!" Dawn runs up the stairs and blows by me
into the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Geez, I've never seen a kid so glad to shower before."</p>

<p>"Well the sooner she showers, the sooner she gets to put on her new
pyjamas." Buffy says as she sits down beside me on the stairs.</p>

<p>"Is that one of those girl things I don't understand?"</p>

<p>"Could be," she laughs. "So, you up for that little chat now?" I nod at her
and she takes my hand in hers and pulls me up. We walk into her, or our, or
whose ever room it is now and I sprawl out on the bed as she shuts the door
behind us.</p>

<p>"So what's the what B? I thought everything in there was kind of self
explanatory."</p>

<p>"Most of it was, and there's only one thing I really care about." She sits
down straddling my waist and suddenly I'm not so concerned with thoughts of
my journal anymore.</p>

<p>"What do you care about then B?" I sit up and wrap my arms around her,
holding her in place on my lap.</p>

<p>"For one, I care about you," she smiles and gives me a quick kiss. "I'm
past all that happened between us. What I want to talk about is what
happened before we ever knew each other."</p>

<p>I know exactly where this is going and I let my arms fall to my sides as I
lay back down on the bed. "B, I can explain the things I did to you and the
scoobs until I'm blue in the face, but please don't make me talk about my
childhood."</p>

<p>"Your childhood is exactly why you did what you did Faith. That's why you
love Dawn so much isn't it?" she asks softly as her palm caresses my cheek.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I just want to make sure she never has to deal with anything like I
did. No kid deserves that." I look away from her so she doesn't notice the
tears that are threatening my eyes.</p>

<p>"You know you didn't deserve any of that either right?" She makes me look
at her and she wipes the tears from my eyes.</p>

<p>"I do now. I'm just glad I'm a slayer because if I weren't I probably would
have died. Though death was more than welcome back then. After what
happened, after the beatings and my step father raping me, I didn't think
anyone could ever really love me. You proved me wrong B, and I couldn't even
tell you how glad I am you did. I'm still kind of fucked from it. When I get
hurt I still get the urge to go drink like my mom did. Hell, I thought about
it this morning. I'm scared I'll screw up again B. How many chances can you
keep giving me?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that you won't Faith. But you know I could screw up too.
But if it happens, I know how much you love me. I also know you love Dawn.
So if it happens, I'll give you another chance. Whether it takes three,
four, or five chances, I'll never give up on you Faith. I promise. You have
to promise me one thing though."</p>

<p>"Anything B." I whisper sincerely.</p>

<p>"If you ever feel yourself slipping, or if you're hurting you come talk to
me about it. Even if it's just something small like what Dawn said to you
this morning."</p>

<p>"She told you about that huh?" I sit back up and pull B back into my arms
suddenly wanting her as close to me as possible.</p>

<p>"Yeah. After you left she was really scared that you were mad at her so she
told me." B starts running her fingers through my hair and it feels so
relaxing I can't help but yawn.</p>

<p>"I hope she knows I'd never be mad at her. And yeah, I promise B. I won't
just walk off like I did this morning. It's still kind of hard on me though.
I've never trusted anyone before you."</p>

<p>"I know," she whispers as she kisses my forehead. "It's something we'll
work on together. You should probably get some sleep now though. You're
going to have a big day tommorow."</p>

<p>I can't help but smile at that. "You're not making me go back to the mall
are you?" I ask as my eyes narrow just before I start to tickle her.</p>

<p>"No, I'll only make you go once a month. Tommorow we're going to have a
talk with the whole gang and get this all worked out. So rest up." She pulls
herself out of my reach and starts changing into her new pyjamas. I take
that as my cue to strip down, and crawl under the covers.</p>

<p>"Do we get to try that cuddling thing again? I kinda liked that," I pat the
spot on the bed next to me and she eagerly crawls in and lays in my arms.</p>

<p>"Anything for you," she winks at me just before turning off her lamp that's
beside the bed.</p>

<p>"You know I'm going to hold you to that right?" I bend my head forward and
catch her mouth in a tender kiss.</p>

<p>"I look forward to it," she says as we break apart.</p>

<p>"Hey wait, aren't we like supposed to say goodnight to Dawn or something?"
B starts laughing softly, so I'm taking that as a no. "Be nice." I poke her
in the ribs just for good measure. "I'm new to this mommie stuff too."</p>

<p>"And you're doing a great job at it so far. Now go to sleep before I kick
you out and make you sleep on the couch." She pokes me back to let me know
she's just teasing. I don't say anything back and instead my fingers lazily
trace patterns on her back. I watch her as she falls to sleep, and just when
I think I've seen her at her best I realize how wrong I really am. I don't
think she'll ever cease to amaze me.</p>
