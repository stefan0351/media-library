<!-- Second Chance \ Part 4 -->

<p>The drive back to Sunnydale was rather uneventful. Neither of
us talked, but it was a comfortable silence between us. About halfway
through the trip B took my hand into her own and gave me this smile
that made me loathe myself. All the sudden it sank in that I caused
her years of hurt, and here she is saying she loves me. I took my
free hand and delicately began to trace patterns on the top of her
hand that was holding mine. I can feel the tears forming in my eyes
and I know that there's nothing I could ever do to make this up to
her, or anyway that I could ever forgive myself. </p>

<p>I look at B and the tears are falling freely down my face,
and she still doesn't say anything. She only squeezes my hand softly
knowing that nothing she says right now could make me feel any
better. I'm craving more contact with her and if she weren't driving
right now I'd pull her into my arms and never let her go. It's almost
a scary feeling I have, like I just want to melt into her, to
completely become connected to her beyond just the slayer part. I've
always needed B, but only now will I let myself admit that. I used to
think that needing someone made me weak, almost like being second
best. I know B doesn't think I'm weak though, or second best to her.
She's always seen us as equals, and I was just too far gone to
believe her.  </p>

<p>It's almost funny to think that prison is what made me sane,
if you can call it sanity that I have. I guess we'll find out if I
can really be good and stop hurting people that I care about. Finally
my tears stop and I raise her hand and kiss it softly and she smiles
at me again. "I love you Buffy. I know I screw things up a lot, but
if you help me I can be good for you." I feel incredibly lame, asking
for help but I know I can't do this without her help. She is the only
reason I still live, and there's no point in denying that I need her
any longer. No more games, no more walls between us from now on. </p>

<p>She pulls off the highway and we pass a big sign that's off
to the side of the road. In big letters, instead of saying `Welcome
To Sunnydale' some kid must've stuck a piece of cardboard that he
wrote on in front of the `dale' part so it now reads `Welcome To
Sunnyhell'. If only the people that lived here knew how true that
was. I take a deep breath as we drive further into town, knowing now
my chance to prove I'm different really starts. Here is my second
chance on a silver platter and I've never been so scared in my life. </p>

<p>When B stopped outside of her house I was most surprised. I
knew she said we were going home, but I thought she just meant
Sunnydale. I had no idea she meant her home. "B, I don't think your
family's going to be particularly happy with me coming here." I say,
suddenly regretting the things I did to them in the past. </p>

<p>"Well Dawn's always liked you so I don't think she'll mind
that much if you stay here. There's no way I want you going back to
that cheap motel. And I'm sure there's the apartment from the mayor
but I kind of wanted you to stay with me."  When she shuts the
ignition off the silence consumes us, neither knowing where exactly
to go from here. As odd as it might seem, us making up was the easy
part.</p>

<p>"What about Miss S? She won't want me in her house after what
I did to her." She looks at me confused, and I see the hurt in her
eyes at the mention of her mother's name. I know the hurt in those
beautiful eyes can mean only one thing. "No, that can't be," I
whisper more to myself than anyone else. Miss S was always cool to
me, even after all I did. She was almost the mother I never had, but
of course I had to screw that up along with everything else that I
had going for me in this town. </p>

<p>"It wasn't vampires or anything. There was this tumor and we
couldn't do anything. I thought Angel would have told you." Buffy
wrapped her arms around herself and I suddenly realized just how much
I really do love her. I never wanted to let anything hurt her like
that again.  I wanted to say something reassuring, to take her into
my arms and tell her how sorry I was, but it seemed as if my own body
was numb. In fact, we both probably would have stayed there being the
doom and gloom twins for the rest of the day had it not been for Dawn
who chose then to come and greet us. </p>

<p>Now while Angel didn't tell me about Miss S, he did tell me
that Dawn isn't really B's sister. All my memories of her are just
made up or some bullshit. She's some key or something and B died to
save her, but like last time she died, it didn't last for long.
That's B for you, the unstoppable one. I never found out how she came
back to life, but death isn't the topic I wish to stay on at the
moment so I'll save it for later. Instead B and I hop out of the car
and Dawn practically jumps on me and gives me the biggest hug I've
ever gotten in my life. I guess no one bothered to tell her just how
much of a psycho I was and the things I did to her mom. </p>

<p>"Miss me much D?" I ask as she pulls me into the house. She
smiles when I call her D and I can't help but remember the first time
I called her that. She used to get so jealous of how I called B, well
B. So I called her D once, just to try it out and she practically
beamed. If I didn't know better I'd say the kid had a crush on me. </p>

<p>"Are you going to stay with us?" Dawn looked from me to B;
and I just shrugged. I really had no clue what was going on, or where
I go from here. I guess B and I are together now, so SunnyD is my
home again but I still feel like I don't fit in around here. </p>

<p>"I was hoping you would stay with us Faith. I'd really like
it if you did." B says in that soft shy voice of hers and there's no
way I could ever refuse her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I mean, if you're sure you want me here. I'd be glad
to stay. On one condition that is," a smile forms across my lips as I
see the nervous looks they give me. It's nice to know I can still
make them sweat a bit. "As soon as that sun's finished setting we go
kick some ass. I've been aching for a good slay."</p>

<p>B laughs and nods, and I can tell she's semi relieved that it
wasn't something else. Dawn just looks at me like I'm crazy for
actually enjoying slaying. But that's what I was born for. I was born
a killer and it would do me no good to hate what I do. Just then my
stomach speaks up letting out a loud growl and I almost find myself
blushing as the two sisters stare at me. "What?
It's not like they feed us well in prison."</p>

<p>"Well since this is your home now, feel free to help yourself
to anything you want." </p>

<p>Did she just say home? Damn, I have a home. If I were the
sentimental type, which I'm not, I would have pulled the two of them
into a hug and thanked them for helping me get my life back in order.
Instead I just smile at them and go to raid the kitchen. There isn't
much in there, and I know I'll be hungry as hell after slaying so I
settle for a bowl of Dawn's cereal and when I go back into the living
room I notice the two of them took off to do their own thing. I
collapse onto the couch, where I assume I'll be sleeping from now on
and turn on some cartoons. </p>

<p>"Glad to see you've made yourself at home," B's standing
behind the couch and I wonder how long she's been watching me. </p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't…" I start but a pair of soft fingers on
my lips silences me.</p>

<p>"No apologies Faith. Like I said, this is your home. I like
it like this. It's kind of like I'm seeing the real Faith for the
first time. And I'm falling more in love with you than I ever thought
possible." Before I could say anything in response B's fingers were
soon replaced with her soft lips gently pressed against mine. I wrap
my arms around her waist to deepen the kiss with her but before we
can go on any longer I here Dawn clearing her throat and I quickly
pull away from B.</p>

<p>"I…I…" Oh God, I've turned into an idiot. Can't think. Are my
cheeks burning? They are. I'm blushing. What the hell is this? I look
up to find the two of them laughing at my embarrassment.</p>

<p>"You what Faith?" Dawn's got an evil glint in her eyes and I
know she's just waiting to tease the hell out of me. Good thing I'm
just one step ahead of her. And thanks to my great slayer speed,
before she even knows what's happening I've got her pinned to the
ground and I'm tickling her. I don't really know why I'm doing it,
because I've never been one to play around like this before but it
just seems like the thing to do. The only kind of playing I did was
with guys, and I'd rather not revisit those days. </p>

<p>"Buffy, help!" Dawn actually yelps as I continue to tickle
her. I move so I'm straddling her hips making sure that there's no
chance of her escaping. After a few more seconds of the tickle
torture I stop to look up at B who's laughing so hard she's crying,
and then look at Dawn whose face is a deep shade of red. It's not
even been a full day since I've been out of prison and I've already
got a home, a girlfriend, and Dawn who is like my own kid sister. I
pull myself off Dawn and go to sit back on the couch. </p>

<p>"Faith?" I know they're both looking at me but I can't face
them now. I can't do this. I'm Faith, the fuck up. I don't deserve
this because I know I'll only let them down in the end.</p>

<p>"You ready to go kick some vamp ass?" I ask before I turn
around. B knows better than to ask questions in front of Dawn, but
she knows something's wrong too. Guess I'll have to talk about it
while we're out. After all, I did promise no secrets this time.</p>

<p>"Faith?" I finally look at Dawn and can tell she's worried
about me. She's a cool kid, and if I stick around this place, which
I'm sure B will make me, taking care of her becomes my first priority.</p>

<p>"I'm five by five D," I smile at her reassuringly as I walk
to the door. B goes into mother mode and tells Dawn she better not go
anywhere while we're gone and that she shouldn't stay up too late.
Dawn's just rolling her eyes at B and eventually I grab her arm and
pull her out the door. "We'll be back later," I call out as I shut
the door behind me. B shoots me a look that tells me she's not
exactly thrilled that I didn't let her finish being motherly, so I
mimic D and roll my eyes at her.</p>

<p>She swats at my arm playfully and as I smile at her I see the
serious look spread across her features. Cautiously, she reaches out
and takes my hand in hers and as our fingers entwine I realize how
scared I really am. "I don't deserve any of this B. You shouldn't
love me after what I did. You shouldn't give me a home or trust me
with your little sister. I'll fuck everything up like I always do," I
say to her before she even gets to ask her question.</p>

<p>"You know I'm going to disagree with you, don't you? Yes,
you've done a lot of things that weren't the greatest, but I've
messed up too. My mom has, Giles has. I know you're not a bad person
Faith and I love you. Dawn adores you and thinks you're the coolest
person to ever walk the earth practically. I read your journal, and
in it you said you'd rather die than ever hurt me again."</p>

<p>"I would B. That's why you have to let me leave, before I
hurt you. I couldn't live with myself if I ever did that again. How
can you just forgive me so easily when I can't even forgive myself?"</p>

<p>"The only way you'll hurt me is if you leave me alone again
Faith. It would kill me, and Dawn. Don't do that to us," her voice
cracks and it almost sounds like she's pleading with me. There's a
look of such desperation in her eyes that it breaks my heart, but
knowing she's that serious about me being with her finally makes me
realize she loves me as much as I love her. I can't let my fears of
hurting her control me because then I'll never be able to be truly
happy. Not that I think I deserve any sort of happiness, but B wants
me happy. </p>

<p>Knowing that any words I say wouldn't be enough to show her
just how much I love her I pull her into my arms and hold her to me
tightly. I lift her chin with two fingers and kiss her as tenderly as
possible. I feel as if I could drown in her touch, and loose myself
in her when we kiss. It's the most incredible thing I've ever felt.
Believe me, I've felt a lot of things but none of them compare to
this love stuff. </p>

<p>"Come on, it's been a long day. Lets go kick some ass so I
can get you in bed." </p>

<p>I raise an eyebrow at that statement and I get one of those
goofy grins that only B is capable of giving me. "You want me that
bad huh?" Now it's her turn to roll her eyes as she drags me along
behind her. </p>

<p>"I just want to cuddle with you," she says in a voice so
innocent I hardly recognize it as hers. I'm not exactly sure what
this cuddling stuff is, considering I've never done it before but as
long as it involves B I'm sure it's good. She kisses me again and for
a moment I forget we're even standing in the middle of a graveyard.
Funny how she can make even this place seem romantic. At least until
you see a slimy demon about to hit your girlfriend in the head with
some rather large blunt object.</p>

<p>I push her out of the way just in time to be on the receiving
end of the wooden hammer that was just about to hit B. "Oh fuck," is
all I can say as darkness engulfs me. Next time I'll know better than
to let my guard down in a graveyard. I just hope B can kick this
things ass.</p>
