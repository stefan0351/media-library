<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 4 -->

<p>When Buffy woke up the next morning the first thing she noticed was that
Missy was already gone. She was slightly disappointed because she wanted to
tell her new friend about her dream with Faith. As she looked at the clock
beside her bed though, she realized why Missy was no where in sight. She
cursed out loud as she realized she had been late for her first class not
only of the day, but of her college life all together. "Great," Buffy
muttered to herself as she pulled on some clothes.</p>

<p>By the time she got dressed and actually found where her class was supposed
to be it was already over. She thought about going and introducing herself
to her new teacher but a familiar voice stopped her from going into the
class. "Wills!" Buffy exclaimed as she saw her best friend walking down the
hall.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy. How did everything go last night?" Willow asked casually as the
two walked side by side down the hall.</p>

<p>"I found her just in time actually. She was pretty cool about finding out
there's vampires and stuff. I know you still have reservations about Missy
because of her looking like Faith, but she's a really sweet girl. I'd really
like it if you all could give her a chance."</p>

<p>"I don't know Buffy. It's so hard just to see that face again. I can try to
get over it, as long as it's not really Faith. I swear if I ever see Faith
again I'll…" Willow stopped and looked like she was trying to figure out
just what she would do to Faith. "Well I'd do something really mean," she
finally said.</p>

<p>After hearing Willow say that, she knew now wasn't the time to tell her
about her dream with Faith, or the fact that she was going to go see her in
the hospital soon. Then she also remembered what happened last time she kept
secrets from her friends. She was torn between what to do, but then she
finally decided she would wait to tell the gang about her dream, and her
going to see Faith until she knew for sure what was going on herself. "Hey,
when's you next class Wills?"</p>

<p>"Right now actually," Willow replied. "What about you?"</p>

<p>"I don't have another class until this afternoon. I was hoping we could go
hit the espresso pump or something." Buffy told her, sounding a little
disappointed.</p>

<p>"How about tonight then?" Willow asked. Buffy agreed, and Willow stopped
walking as she reached her next class. "I'll call you later," Willow told
her. The two friends said their goodbyes and Buffy headed off to her final
stop before going to see Faith at the hospital.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Buffy, what are you doing here?" Giles asked as he let his slayer into his
house.</p>

<p>"Are you really that unhappy to see me Giles?" the blonde asked as she sat
down on her watcher's couch.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," the man said as he too sat down. "I just expected you
to have classes is all. Could I offer you anything do drink?" he asked. As
he looked at Buffy he could tell she was obviously very nervous about
something.</p>

<p>"No thanks Giles," she replied as she started fidgeting.</p>

<p>"So then what brings you here this morning Buffy?"</p>

<p>"I kind of needed to talk to you about something. I had this dream last
night," Buffy started and watched as Giles took his glasses off and started
polishing them with his shirt.</p>

<p>"A prophecy?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No, nothing bad. It was a slayer dream, between Faith and I. I think. I'm
not really sure if it was real or not. So I was wondering if it were
possible for us to have shared dreams even though she's in a coma."</p>

<p>"What did Faith want?" he asked as he stood up to go find some of his books.</p>

<p>"We made up, sort of. I told her that when she wakes up from her coma that I
want us to try to be friends again," Buffy said, hoping that Giles wouldn't
be angry at her for that.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's wise Buffy? Do you really think you can trust her after
what she did to everyone?" Giles questioned as he sat back down and started
going through some books.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I don't know. I just feel like I have to at least try." Buffy
told him honestly.</p>

<p>"Well you are an adult now Buffy and I think you can make your own
decisions. Just be careful if you're going to get involved with her again."
Buffy nodded at Giles' words and waited to see what he was looking at in his
books. "Since before now there were never two slayers at once, there isn't
really any documentation on the connection between slayers. However, I do
believe that it is possible for the two of you to share dreams even if she
is in a coma. Faith has always been a very strong willed girl, and I believe
she can make it happen even if she can't respond to the outside world."</p>

<p>"So you're saying that it was a slayer dream and not just something I made
up in my head?"</p>

<p>"I'm not really sure. All I'm saying is that it would be possible for that
to happen, or at least I think it would. I even think that in time if the
two of you tried you would be able to meet in your dreams by your own will
whenever you desired to do so."</p>

<p>"Thanks Giles," Buffy stood up and smiled at him. "I'm gonna go see her at
the hospital now. She wanted me to tell her about my new roommate. She looks
just like Faith. It's pretty weird." Buffy started walking towards the door
but before she left she turned around to face her watcher again. "Could you
maybe not tell the others about this until I know what's going on a little
better?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing Buffy. Just remember to be careful, and I want you to let me
know everything that happens with this. Even if it's just you going to see
her I want you to keep me informed on it all. Understood?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah. Later," she said just seconds before slipping out of his door.
She took a steadying breath and began walking towards the hospital to see
Faith for the first time in too long.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Think you could use a lab partner?" an all too familiar voice asked Willow.
The red head practically jumped out of her chair when she heard it.
'Goddess, does she have to sound like Faith too?' Willow thought to herself.
"I'm not her you know. I don't bite Willow. I'm just trying to make a few
friends in this damn town," Missy told Willow as she sat next to her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry but it's just too weird. You're like a constant reminder of what
she did and it's just too creepy." Willow told the brunette without even
making eye contact with her.</p>

<p>"Maybe it'll be good if we work together then. It'll help you to get over
what happened and then maybe one day you'd be able to forgive her for what
she did." Missy said as she tapped her pencil against the desk. "We're
already in the same class so you'll have to get used to seeing me anyways.
Why not just work together?"</p>

<p>"Because you look like Faith. I know it's wrong of me to judge you for it,
or hold it against you. I'm sure you're a very nice person and all but I
can't deal with it. I can't deal with Faith."</p>

<p>"Hello, newsflash. I'm not Faith. You people are unbelievable. One day
you're going to have to deal with Faith because she's not going to stay in a
coma forever. Buffy told me what she did, and I can see why you'd hate her
and I have no right to tell you that you should forgive her. Hell, it's only
my second day in this town and I realize things around here aren't normal
but one thing I can tell you for sure is that if you continue to hate and be
afraid of Faith for the rest of your life, the only person you are hurting
is you. If she really is the monster you think she is, then by hating her
you're only giving her what she wants. Maybe it's not too late for you to
try and help her. Think about it," Missy said as she walked away from
Willow. 'Sweet girl my ass,' Willow thought to herself.</p>

<p>Missy wasn't actually sure where all of that had come from but ever since
she realized how Buffy really felt for Faith she knew beyond anything she
wanted to help her in any way possible. It might mean that Buffy's friends
hated her for it, but it was a sacrifice she would make for Buffy. After
all, she did owe Buffy her life now. In some sort of way, she even felt
connected to Faith simply because the two looked alike. She glanced back at
Willow who looked more angry than anything but she could also tell that the
red head was deep in thought. Missy just hoped that her words would stick in
Willow's mind, and maybe that she'd be able to get through to her in time,
if the red head would give her a chance as a friend.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Buffy said softly as she approached one of the nurses in the
hospital. "Could you please tell me where Faith Spencer's room is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's the girl that's been in a coma all summer isn't she? Are you
family?" The nurse asked as she started to lead Buffy down the hall.</p>

<p>"Just a friend," Buffy replied.</p>

<p>"Her room is right here," the nurse stopped and pointed inside the room.
"You know, you're the first visitor she's had in months." The nurse walked
away after that leaving Buffy standing outside of Faith's room. Buffy felt
an incredible sadness in her heart upon hearing the nurse say that no one
had come to see Faith in months. It made her realize how alone Faith really
is, and it gave her even more determination to become a bigger part of
Faith's life. To make sure that the brunette was never alone again.</p>

<p>As Buffy walked into Faith's room she pulled a chair up beside the bed and
sat down. "Hey sleepy head," Buffy said softly as she took Faith's hand into
her own. "I'm here as promised. Though I really wish you would wake up soon.
Hospitals definitely aren't my favorite place in the world to be and I'm
sure you don't like being here much either huh?"</p>

<p>"I had this dream last night about you," she said to Faith as she brushed a
few strands of the brunette's hair from her face. "I haven't exactly figured
out if it was a real slayer dream or just something I came up with in my
head but either way, I'm here now. If it wasn't a real slayer dream, I want
you to know I forgive you and that I want us to be friends again.</p>

<p>"I just started college, and my new roommate Missy is a rather big reason I
decided on this. I only met her yesterday, but she looks exactly like you.
It kind of gave me the wiggins at first but seeing her made me start to
think about you. I just want things to be right again for us.</p>

<p>"I stopped by Giles' house before I came here. I told him about my dream and
that I want you and I to make amends with each other. I asked him about my
dream, to see if he thought it was a real slayer dream or not but he said it
wasn't sure even though it's possible that it could have been. He even told
me that he thinks it's possible for us to control them, and make them happen
whenever we want. Pretty cool huh?"</p>

<p>Buffy stopped talking and glanced at her watch. "I know this was kind of
short, but I really have to get back to school. I already missed my first
class today and mom will kill me if she finds out I missed both of my
classes. So far college doesn't feel any different than high school. Only
difference is that it's bigger and I don't live at home. I'll come back
soon, I promise."</p>

<p>The blonde stood from her chair and looked Faith over. She gently traced her
fingers over the outline of Faith's face and bent down to give the younger
slayer a kiss on the forehead. Just as she was about to turn and walk away,
she felt Faith's hand that she was still holding softly squeeze hers.</p>

<p>Buffy felt her heart swell for some reason as she stared down at the
brunette. "Faith?" she questioned. When she didn't receive any response from
the brunette she thought that maybe she had only imagined it happening.
After watching the girl for another few minutes Buffy reluctantly left to
get to her next class. Unfortunately it was just a minute too early, and she
failed to notice Faith open her eyes just after she walked out of the room.</p>
