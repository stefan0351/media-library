<!-- Who's That Girl \ Part 7 -->

<p>When Buffy walked over to her group of friends the first thing she noticed
was the eerie quiet as everyone stared at Faith and Missy. The blonde took
the opportunity to sit down at the table while hoping that she'd magically
be sucked into the floor or better yet, spontaneously combust. 'Where's a
vampire when you need one?' Buffy thought to herself.</p>

<p>Since no one was speaking Faith just smiled and sat on Buffy's lap. "You
mind? There's no other chairs around," she informed her with her usual
carefree attitude.</p>

<p>"Please tell me that's your twin and not who I think it is," Willow said to
Missy as calmly as she could in her situation.</p>

<p>"Sorry to disappoint Red, but it's me," Faith said with a smile that caused
the red head to shudder.</p>

<p>Too shocked to do anything else, the whole group just stared at Buffy
waiting to see her reaction to this. Luckily for her the group was too busy
studying her facial expressions to notice her arms that were now
protectively wrapped around Faith's waist. "Umm guys, Faith's back," she
said softly.</p>

<p>"So we noticed Buff, but my question to you is why aren't you kicking her
skanky ass out of Sunnydale?" Xander asked, the seriousness of his question
evident in his voice.</p>

<p>"Because we kinda made up?" Buffy offered as she hid behind Faith not
noticing that the smirk never left Faith's face. As much as she shouldn't be
since Buffy's friends were obviously unhappy with her, the brunette was
enjoying this.</p>

<p>Missy quickly decided that this was between the gang, and stood up to make
her exit but Willow glared at her. "Sit," the red head commanded and Missy
sat back down, wondering why she was even listening to Willow. "How long?"
she questioned harshly.</p>

<p>"How long what?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Have you been chummy with our worst enemy," Xander answered for his
lifelong friend.</p>

<p>"It all just happened last night. I wasn't trying to keep this from you all
or anything," Buffy said. "It all just happened kinda fast. I'm still trying
to get used to it, but Faith's good now," Buffy told them. Faith could feel
Buffy's uneasiness and placed her hand on top of the blonde slayers in
comfort. She wanted to plead her case with the scoobies but she already knew
they wouldn't even listen to her so she held her tongue.</p>

<p>Willow's expression changed as if something just clicked in her mind. "That
was you last night at the Espresso Pump wasn't it?" Willow asked as she
looked at Faith and the brunette only nodded. "I can't believe you Buffy.
You lied to me, again!" Willow said as calmly as she could, not wanting to
make a scene in front of the entire dining hall. "And you," she stopped and
turned her attention to Missy. "You knew about this too?" Missy nodded her
confirmation and Willow shook her head sadly. "Just when I thought we could
actually be friends."</p>

<p>The red head stood up from her chair, trying her best to keep calm. "This is
bullshit Buffy. I don't know what she's done to fool you, but she'll only
hurt you, and us again if she gets the chance. You might be okay with
risking our lives again, but I'm not so I won't stick around for it," she
paused to look at Faith. "And don't you ever let me see you again or you
will regret it. I'm not the same girl I was in high school, and you don't
scare me anymore. Understood?"</p>

<p>Faith's eyes widened in surprise at the girls statement and she nodded her
head. It was clear to her that Willow was different than she was in high
school. Even though she was still the babbling, cute hacker she remembered
her self confidence seemed to have grown a lot. Willow gave Faith one last
disgusted look before making her way out of the dining hall.</p>

<p>Oz stood up and nodded at Buffy before going to find his girlfriend. He was
grateful that he wasn't the one who had to break the news to Willow, and he
knew that given time Willow would be able to forgive Buffy for this. He
stopped for a few seconds and turned around to wait for Xander, whom he knew
would be making his exit as well. "Nice one Buff," Xander said coldly as he
caught up with Oz and the two left the dining hall.</p>

<p>"That was-"</p>

<p>"Entertaining?" Faith supplied for Buffy as she made her way out of the
blonde's lap.</p>

<p>"To say the least," Missy answered. "I'm outta here."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said absently as she met her roommate's gaze. "I'm sorry that
Willow's mad at you because of me. I don't mean to make your college life
such hell."</p>

<p>"Don't sweat it Buffy. She'll get over it, and it's not your fault." Missy
smiled at them weakly before making her exit. She didn't doubt that Willow
would forgive Buffy, and she hoped that the red head would be able to
forgive her for whatever it was that she did wrong.  All she could do was
hope that her earlier words about getting over her grudge on Faith were
still roaming around Willow's head somewhere.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I screwed things up for you again B," Faith said as she watched
Buffy softly beat her head against the table.</p>

<p>"It's not your fault Faith. It was wrong of me to want to keep you a secret
from them for longer anyways. It had to happen, and it's best it's already
over with." Buffy continued to beat her head into the table until she felt
Faith's hand on her forehead stopping her.</p>

<p>"So who was that hottie I saw you talking to in line?" Faith asked, hoping
that the change of subject might help lighten the mood a little. Buffy
groaned in response.</p>

<p>"I think I just realized I don't need to start a relationship with anyone
new right now," Buffy replied as she looked sadly at Faith.</p>

<p>"What about with someone old then?" Faith asked softly.</p>

<p>"Faith?" Buffy questioned, trying to figure out if the brunette were serious
or not.</p>

<p>"Sorry B," Faith said as she shook her head. "You know me, speak without
thinking first. But he's a looker, you should go after him. Maybe a little
uhhhh would make you feel better," Faith laughed, hoping that Buffy would
think she was only joking about her previous comment. Actually, she was
trying to convince herself that she was only joking about it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Willow sat out in Oz's van clenching and unclenching her fists in
frustration and anger. "How could… It's Faith! Is she stupid or something?"
Willow wondered aloud. "And Missy. Just when I thought maybe she wasn't so
bad you know? Even if it was only for a night, they lied to me! I can't
believe Buffy lied to me again," Willow said sadly.</p>

<p>"So what are you more upset about here?" Oz asked as he took his
girlfriend's hand into his own. "Is it because Buffy didn't tell you last
night that it was Faith in the Espresso Pump, or that she forgave her?"</p>

<p>"It's everything. Faith is evil. Buffy's supposed to kill evil yet she seems
to make friends with it all the time. It'll just end in disaster."</p>

<p>"Can't say I disagree with you on that one," Oz stated. "Now why are you
angry with Missy?"</p>

<p>"Because when I went there last night, to their dorm and we kinda made
friends with each other. She probably doesn't even have a boyfriend. She
lied to me, to protect Faith and it's wrong and it hurts. Is there something
wrong with me?" Willow questioned as she turned to look at her boyfriend.
"Why does she always choose Faith over me, her best friend?"</p>

<p>Oz bent over from the drivers seat in his van and kissed her softly.
"There's nothing wrong with you. Buffy loves you, she just makes the wrong
decisions sometimes."</p>

<hr>

<p>A few hours later Faith was making her way back to Buffy's dorm room hoping
that Missy would be there so she could get in. Earlier the blonde had told
her she could crash there for a while since Faith wasn't exactly looking
forward to going back to the old apartment the mayor gave her. Neither of
the slayers were ready to see that place again after the fight they had
there.</p>

<p>Faith was relieved when Missy opened the door to let her in and she made her
way to Buffy's unmade bed and layed upon it. "Sorry about earlier," she said
softly as she looked at Missy. "You seemed happy last night, about being
friends with Red and I kinda screwed it up for you."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it," Missy replied. "She'll come around eventually."</p>

<p>"Is it okay with you if I crash here for a little while? I don't really have
anywhere else to go, or at least any place pleasant and B said I could stay
here and I wanted to make sure that it's cool with you too."</p>

<p>Missy smiled and told her that she didn't mind one bit and Faith got more
comfortable on Buffy's bed. "I see the way you look at B and I," Faith said
out of the blue as she rolled onto her side to look at Missy who was sitting
at her desk. "It's like you know something we don't."</p>

<p>"Maybe I do," Missy coaxed, hoping the conversation would go where she
wanted it to. Faith smiled sadly at her, realizing just why Missy always
looked at the two like she did.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving soon anyways, so don't get any ideas about playing matchmaker.
This is the way it has to be. I think I realized that a long time ago,"
Faith told her as she got up to leave. Missy just watched as her look alike
walked out of the room in stunned silence. She could only hope that Faith
was only joking about leaving.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy walked quietly through one of Sunnydale's many graveyards. It was
still sunny out so she knew that there wouldn't be any vampire disturbances
and it was the only place she could think of where she wouldn't be
disturbed. After everything that happened earlier, she needed some alone
time and she was thankful that when she asked Faith to be alone the brunette
had agreed without asking questions.</p>

<p>She knew her friend's reaction to Faith wouldn't be good, but now she had no
idea of how to get them to forgive her, or the younger slayer. She knew she
couldn't, and wouldn't apologize for making up with Faith even if it was
what her friends had wanted to hear. She knew she somehow had to get them to
give Faith another chance but she didn't know how to go about it.</p>

<p>Then there was the matter of what Faith had said to her after all her
friends stormed off. First the brunette had been telling her to go after
Parker, and then she mentioned someone old, and from the look in her eyes
when she said she had only been joking Buffy knew it had been a serious
question.</p>

<p>She knew before everything happened Faith flirted with her all the time but
she figured it was because the rogue slayer liked making her uncomfortable.
It had never crossed her mind that she might actually like her. When it came
down to it, Buffy realized she hardly knew the real Faith at all. Knowing
that, and that she's willing to face the wrath of all the people she cares
about to defend the brunette confused her even more. After realizing that
she wasn't getting anywhere with her thoughts Buffy headed back to campus in
hopes of finding her best friend.</p>

<hr>

<p>Xander was busying himself at Giles appartment shelving some books hoping to
get his mind off of Faith being back. As if the fact that Buffy's roommate
looked exactly like her wasn't enough, seeing the girl that used him and
tried to kill him put a huge damper in his day. He wanted to believe Buffy's
judgment of her, but Faith had a way of fooling people, which he had seen
first hand. He wasn't angry with Buffy like Willow for forgiving Faith, but
it didn't mean that he had any plans of being anything but tolerant to her
in the future, and that would only be for Buffy's sake.</p>

<p>As him and Giles bickered about the alphabet he noticed someone walking into
the appartment. "You should lock your door," Anya said as she made her
entrance.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I'm kicking myself," was Giles' reply.</p>

<p>Xander looked over at Anya a bit surprised, the last time he had seen her
she was fleeing town in terror, which he didn't fail to mention to her. She
pulled him outside and Xander shut the door behind him. "Your mother said
you were working here," she said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I need some money," he replied, wondering what she was doing back.</p>

<p>"Where is our relationship going?" She asked abruptly, and Xander thought
his eyes might bug out of his face. This was definitely the last thing he
needed at the moment. But then, maybe the distraction from Faith would be
good.</p>

<hr>

<p>'Fuck this,' Missy thought as she slammed her text book shut. Maybe she
didn't know this whole group of friends well yet, but the situation was
really starting to piss her off. She remembered Buffy pointing out which
dorm room was Willow's. Maybe it wasn't her place to intervene, but she was
going to anyways. But then, since Willow was mad at her, she had every right
to get involved in the situation.</p>

<p>Pulling on some shoes, she left for Willow's room and knocked on the door
loudly. When the red head answered the door and gave her an icy glare Missy
just shoved past her into the room. "What the hell are you pissed at me
for?" she asked before Willow even got a chance to speak.</p>

<p>"Missy?" Willow asked, just to be sure. When the brunette nodded at her,
Willow went and sat down on her bed. "Let's see, could it be because you
lied to me last night?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I did it for Buffy, and you can't tell me that under any other circumstance
you wouldn't have done the same damn thing. Ever since I got here you've
been treating me like I was Faith and I thought you finally got over that
last night."</p>

<p>"I did get over the part about you looking like Faith, but I don't need
friends that lie to me," Willow said coldly.</p>

<p>"So does that mean that your not friends with Buffy anymore, because she
lied to you?" Missy questioned.</p>

<p>"No, that doesn't mean she's not my friend. She always will be, even if she
lied. It just hurts."</p>

<p>"Then why am I any different? I try to help her out and you get pissed at me
for it. And if Buffy really were your best friend I'd think you'd trust her
enough to know what she's doing and believe her about Faith. I know Faith
hurt all of you, and I'm sorry for that but she hurt Buffy too didn't she?
From what I hear, she tried killing her boyfriend and if Buffy can forgive
that and see that Faith's a different person how can you not? Maybe you
should stop being so selfish and see that you're only hurting everyone else
by this, and yourself."</p>

<p>Missy stopped talking and walked to the door. "All I wanted was to be your
friend Willow, but I don't need friends who are so self absorbed that they
feel sorry for themselves about things like this. Too bad you couldn't get
over it and see that I'm a good person just like Buffy, and even Faith now."
Missy opened Willow's door to walk out but before she got very far she felt
a hand on her shoulder stopping her.</p>

<p>"Stay?" Willow asked softly and Missy turned around. "I'm not mad at you.
I'm just hurt. Let me at least explain my side?"</p>

<hr>

<p>When Buffy made her way back to campus she decided to head straight for
Willow's to make amends but on the way there she ran into the same guy she
had seen earlier in the dining hall. "Buffy of Stevenson wasn't it?" he
asked casually.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Parker of Kresge," she said with a smile.</p>

<p>"You going somewhere?"</p>

<p>"I've gotta go do damage control with a friend," was her reply. She knew she
had to find Willow as soon as possible, but she still let herself get
engrossed in conversation with the upperclassman.</p>

<p>Faith, who had been searching for the blonde finally spotted her as she was
making friends with the 'hottie' from before. She smiled sadly as she
noticed that Buffy seemed to be enjoying herself. She knew she couldn't deny
to herself that she had feelings for Buffy any longer, but that didn't mean
she had to share that with the older girl.</p>

<p>Besides, she couldn't stay in Sunnydale any longer. Tomorrow she'd be
leaving, she was going to do the dutiful thing and turn herself in for
murder and leave the town that she was supposed to make her home when she
first arrived there. Maybe if she hadn't have screwed up, she would still be
welcome in Sunnydale. Maybe she'd have friends and a chance with Buffy if
she hadn't, but there was no room for maybe's any longer. Leaving was the
best thing to do, if not for her than for Buffy. She didn't need to be a
burden to the blonde any longer.</p>

<p>'But that's tomorrow,' she thought to herself. 'At least for today you can
still pretend that things are fine.' After all, all she wanted was one more
night with the only person she ever cared about.</p>
