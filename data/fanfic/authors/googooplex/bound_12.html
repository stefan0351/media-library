<!-- Bound \ Chapter 12 - Saving Lieutenant Torres -->

<P>Tom and Harry sat in the mess hall, eating, both occupied by their thoughts. It had been over two weeks now and there had been no change in B'Elanna's condition. </P>
<P>"So, have you seen Seven recently?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>"Only when I visited sickbay. The doc had to force her out last week and give her strict visiting times because she wasn't eating, sleeping, nothing. It's was only when poor Icheb promised to keep watch over B'Elanna that kind of brought Seven back."</P>
<P>"The Captain's put her in charge of engineering," Tom went on, pushing his meal away. "It gives her something to focus on and besides she's good at it."</P>
<P>"Right." Harry nodded. " That's good.  Does the doc say anything new?"</P>
<P>"Just monitoring the tumour. Wait and see."</P>
<P>"The waiting's driving me mad." Harry burst out</P>
<P>"You and me both, buddy."</P>

<hr>

<P>"Doctor to the bridge."</P>
<P>"Go ahead, Doctor</P>

<P>"I need you to come to come to sickbay immediately," the Doctor sounded urgent.</P>
<P>"Has something gone wrong with the surgery?" Janeway jumped out of her chair, already on her way.</P>
<P>"Not exactly, but there has been a development. Hurry, I haven't much time."</P>
<P>"On my way."</P>
<P>As she approached sickbay, Seven was running from the opposite direction. She had been ordered away from sickbay until after the operation.</P>
<P>"What is it? What has happened?" she asked desperately.</P>
<P>Janeway shook her head, indicating her ignorance. Seven looked ill. Over the past 3 weeks she had barely eaten or rested. Only the threat of sedation had forced her to regenerate every so often. Janeway had found out that Seven could no longer sleep, knowing that B'Elanna was in mortal danger. The work that she did, keeping the engines running smoothly, had saved her sanity. It allowed her to be close to B'Elanna.</P>
<P>The doctor was in his surgical scrubs, in his office and the biobed with B'Elanna had been screened off.</P>
<P>"I need you both to sit down," he invited grimly.</P>
<P>"I prefer to stand." The reply was simultaneous from both women.</P>
<P>"Is she dead?" Seven was composed but her voice sounded strangled.</P>
<P>"No, I've started the procedure and I am certain that she will make a full recovery. However, there are some complications, which is why I've asked both of you here."</P>
<P>He took a deep breath and paced the small office.</P>
<P>"As I indicated the toxins migrated to B'Elanna's brain stem and form a large transfused myanoma. I have already successfully extracted that tumour. What I didn't detect was a secondary, smaller tumour lodged in her neural cortex ..."</P>
<P>"Can you get it out?" the Captain was anxious.</P>
<P>"Yes, but ..."</P>
<P>"But, what ?" she interrupted impatiently.</P>
<P>"In Klingons, the neural cortex controls memory function." Seven recited the facts calmly, but she had gone pale. She knew what the doctor was about to say.</P>
<P>The doctor nodded sadly." She will loose anything from 6 months to 2 years of her memory. There is nothing I can do to prevent it or to preserve those memories ..."</P>
<P>"Will she recover?" Seven asked the words softly.</P>
<P>"Yes, but ..."</P>
<P>"There are no buts, you must do everything to save B'Elanna's life. Other considerations are irrelevant."</P>
<P>The doctor nodded gravely and returned to his patient.</P>
<P>Janeway was in shock. She looked at the stony-faced borg and wondered what she was thinking.</P>
<P>"Seven, I'm no psychiatrist, but you do understand ..."</P>
<P>"That unless she remembers unaided, I will never be able to tell B'Elanna of our feelings for each other." Seven realised that her voice sounded strange and there was a rushing in her ears.</P>
<P>Her world was falling apart. The pain and fear of assimilation was nothing to the thought of B'Elanna being alive in the world and not loving her.</P>
<P>"But she will live," she said the words out loud to comfort herself. "She will live."</P>
<P>" She may even think that she's still married to Tom. Seven, what will you do? How will you cope?"</P>
<P> Seven drew an invisible mantle of protection around her and drew herself up straight. It was the cloak she wore in the days before friendship and love opened up her heart and made her whole.</P>
<P>"I will adapt."</P>
