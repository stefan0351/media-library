<!-- Bound \ Chapter 16 - Somnambulist -->

<P>Seven walked along the quiet corridors towards her quarters, thinking hard about the advice given to her by Janeway. The thought off actively pursuing B'Elanna afresh hadn't really occurred to her. </P>
<P>How could I possibly make B'Elanna love me?  </P>
<P>The fact that B'Elanna needed no encouragement the first time round didn't occur to her. She have to prepare some line of action, factor in all the different variables ...</P>
<P>Seven was deep in thought when the object of her affection appeared round the corner, walking in her direction.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, is something troubling you?" Seven was disturbed.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was wearing a short silky black nightgown and was barefoot and had a blank, vacant expression on her face.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>The engineer walked straight past her without acknowledgement.</P>
<P>For a heart-stopping moment, Seven thought that B'Elanna had somehow been assimilated, she was displaying all of the characteristics of a drone. But common sense kicked in, the Klingon was somnambulating, strange as it sounded.</P>
<P>Seven felt a surge of protectiveness well up as the smaller woman walked towards to turbolift, she wasn't sure what to do, so she followed, tapping her combadge as she entered the turbolift with B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Deck 10."</P>
<P>Her voice sounded normal, Seven thought. And she wants to go to engineering.</P>
<P>"Doctor, I need your advice," she was still watching B'Elanna closely.</P>
<P>"Seven, what is it?" the doctor asked.</P>
<P>"I have just found B'Elanna walking in the corridors on her way to engineering, she appears to be sleepwalking. Should I wake her?"</P>
<P>"NO. Under no circumstances should you wake her. Get a security detail to follow her to make sure she doesn't hurt herself or anyone else. Do you understand?"</P>
<P>"I will escort B'Elanna myself, doctor. Do you have any other instructions?"</P>
<P>"Her subconscious obviously wants her to complete some task or other in engineering, typical compulsive workaholic behaviour," the doctor tutted.</P>
<P>"Once she's done whatever she feels she needs to do, try and direct her back to her quarters. You can talk to her quietly and gently steer her in the right direction, but she must wake naturally, don't try to force her."</P>
<P>"I understand, doctor. I will contact you if I require further assistance. Thank you. Seven out."</P>
<P>Seven watched B'Elanna carefully, but there was no expression on the beautiful engineer's face, no warmth, no laughter, no friendship and no love. The ex-drone was used to seeing all of those emotions on the Klingon's face and this cold, empty stare was somehow frightening.</P>
<P>Seven couldn't help herself. She moved closer to B'Elanna in the turbo lift and gently ran her hand down the Klingon's bare arm. She was surprised when B'Elanna turned towards her at the touch.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>There was still no response but B'Elanna did look up at the sound of Seven's voice and a fleeting look of recognition crossed her face. It didn't wake her but it did allay Seven's fears a little.</P>
<P>They entered to engineering, B'Elanna walking slowly but purposefully, she knew where she was going.</P>
<P>The engineer stopped at the warp core and stared at it for a minute and then walked to a workstation, punching in some calculations. Seven stood close and watched over the shorter woman's shoulder, making sure that B'Elanna didn't eject the warp core or something.</P>
<P>The perfectionist in Seven couldn't help but smile. B'Elanna's subconscious had brought her to engineering to correct a 0.032 variance in the warp nacelles. The engineer was a woman after Seven's own heart. B'Elanna always said that she could work Voyagers engines in her sleep. It appeared that she wasn't joking.</P>
<P>Once the corrections had been made, B'Elanna heaved a sigh and turned round and walked out of main engineering, Seven closely following.</P>
<P>The Borg trailed B'Elanna back to her quarters and decided to follow her in to make sure she went back to bed. The Klingon crawled into her bed and snuggled under the covers, Seven hovering by the bed.</P>
<P>She was shocked when B'Elanna held her hand out and spoke.</P>
<P>"Please stay."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna? Are you awake?" Seven kept her voice low, not wanting to startle her.</P>
<P>"Why won't you stay? Please stay with me." B'Elanna pleaded.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven was puzzled, B'Elanna was still asleep, her eyes open but unfocused.</P>
<P>"I need you to stay, please." B'Elanna was becoming distressed and Seven quickly sat down on the bed beside her, stroking the dark chestnut hair.</P>
<P>"I will stay with you, B'Elanna. I will not leave you."</P>
<P>Her words had the desired effect. B'Elanna sighed happily and lay down on her side, facing the Borg. She fumbled for a moment and managed to grasp Seven's hand, bringing it to her mouth and dropping a small kiss on the open palm. </P>
<P>Seven felt herself tremble at the tender touch, but didn't dare move for fear of breaking the magical spell.</P>
<P>She strained her ears to catch the mumbled words coming from the drowsy Klingon.</P>
<P>"Say you love me. I'm in love with you, Seven, please say you love me too." The words were faint but Seven knew that they were heartfelt. Somewhere, in the chasm of her subconscious, B'Elanna was still deeply in love with Seven.</P>
<P>Seven stretched out beside B'Elanna, gently cupping her cheek and whispered words of love and longing to the woman who possessed her heart and soul.</P>

<P>The next morning there was a good deal of teasing and joking about B'Elanna's little trip to engineering in the dead of night to correct a tiny variance.</P>
<P>B'Elanna only got to hear about it when she reported to sickbay. She had been deep in thought. Somehow remembering fragments of the assault didn't bother her as much this morning as they had the previous night. She was still filled with a bitter rage at what she and Seven had endured, but somehow the night had made things a little better.</P>
<P>B'Elanna blushed as she thought about last night, she quickly looked round to make sure no one noticed her flushed cheeks as she made her way to sickbay.</P>
<P>For some reason, she had been dreaming about Seven, the memory of the dreams was hazy as they often are once, but B'Elanna knew that she felt warm, safe and happy. </P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped dead in her tracks. In her dream, she had felt loved and completely cherished ....by Seven. </P>
<I><P>Of all people</I>. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was perplexed, to say the least. What the sam hill had triggered such a dream? She was beginning to get on quite well with the ex-drone, enjoying her company and dry sense of humour. But this? This was something else. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>As she entered sickbay, Seven was talking to the Doctor and B'Elanna felt herself flushing again at the sight of the tall beautiful woman. Unable to meet her eyes, B'Elanna dropped her gaze to the floor and mumble a greeting at the Borg as she past.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, I trust that you are functioning adequately?" Seven's voice was coolly formal, but B'Elanna still couldn't bring herself to look up and simply nodded.</P>
<P>She thought she detected a hint of a smile in the question, but there was no way she was going to find out staring at the floor. But before she could screw up enough courage, the doors swished closed behind a departing Borg.</P>
<P>"Well, B'Elanna, I trust that you are no worse for wear after your little midnight date." The doctor smirked at the Klingon</P>
<P>"What?" Oh Kahless help, B'Elanna thought, not knowing what to think, surely the EMH couldn't possibly know what she dreamt last night, could he?</P>
<P>"Your date with the warp core nacelles. You were sleepwalking last night, Lieutenant. Fortunately, Seven was on hand to make sure that you didn't get into any mischief."</P>
<P>B'Elanna was stunned. Sleepwalking?</P>
<P>"What did I do?"</P>
<P>"You decided to correct some minor malfunction in engineering. There is hardly any point in my taking you off duty if you continue to work in your sleep, Lieutenant," the Doctor grumbled.</P>
<P>B'Elanna just grinned, she thought it was hilarious. A thought occurred to her.</P>
<P>"You said Seven found me? What did she do?"</P>
<P>"I instructed her not to wake and see what you did. She reported back to me that she saw you safely back in your quarters after you finished tinkering with your engines."</P>
<P>"Oh." A vague idea was forming in her head and she wasn't quite sure what to do with it.</P>
<P>"What do I do to prevent this from happening again?" B'Elanna had no desire to go wandering about the ship in her nightwear again, even if it was to work on the engines.</P>
<P>"Under normal circumstances, I would prescribe a cortical inhibitor to prevent you going from REM sleep to the sleepwalking phase which is slightly different, but that may have an adverse effect on the memories that are gradually returning. The only thing that I can suggest is that you are locked into your room at night to keep you in."</P>
<P>"You are not having me locked in my room." B'Elanna wasn't having any of it.</P>
<P>"Best option for you. I'll discuss it with the Captain."</P>
<P>The rest of her two shifts were taken up with good-natured ribbing about running through the corridors of Voyager in her dressing gown. Though at first Janeway was concerned about the incident, the doctor assured her that though it was undoubtedly linked to the memory that had come to the surface the previous day, B'Elanna would not be hurt by the experience. </P>
<P>Janeway wondered again if she had done the right thing by advising Seven to show her love for B'Elanna. She knew that the ex-drone would have eventually found her own method of dealing with the problem, but maybe a more aggressive approach was the answer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna had a niggling question about last night that she needed answered, and once she got over her blushing fit, she sought Seven out in Astrometrics.</P>
