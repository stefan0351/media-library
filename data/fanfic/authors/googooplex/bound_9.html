<!-- Bound \ Chapter 9 - First Contact -->

<P>Janeway was in her ready room, reading over reports. She was hoping that this expedition went well. They really needed to stock up on resources and it would be nice if the crew could get some shoreleave into the bargain. Everyone had been working double shifts for months now, to keep the ship running. Despite her orders to the contrary, she knew that B'Elanna in particular had had almost quadrupled the amount of time she spent on duty. The only other person who had put in anything like that level of work had been Seven. It appeared that she now spent a good portion of her time working in Engineering as well as Astrometrics. She was becoming an excellent engineer under B'Elanna's tutelage.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled as she recalled the last time she paid a visit to engineering. It was well into the gamma shift and most of deck 10 was deserted.</P>
<P>She found Seven and B'Elanna in a heated debate over a particularly convoluted aspect of the warp core. She stood, unseen, for a brief moment and observed how the two women interacted with each other.</P>
<P>If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, Janeway would never have believed how patient B'Elanna could be. The Klingon painstaking explained the workings and results of the problem they were dealing. It was as if she was teaching Seven her life's craft, passing on all the secrets of her profession.</P>
<P>She spent some time with them, chatting. Janeway chuckled out loud as she recalled making an innocent comment about Seven being almost as good an engineer as Torres. The Klingon had been mock indignant, stating that if the engines heard Janeway, they would sulk for weeks at the thought of anyone else caring for them. </P>
<P>Despite the professionalism that both women displayed, even when there was no one watching, Janeway couldn't help but notice the ever so subtle body language that the two now shared. Sometimes it seemed as if they could also sense each other thoughts and actions.</P>
<P>Even though she had absolutely nothing to do with their joining, Janeway was inordinately proud of the pair. She hoped that they had a very long and rewarding relationship. She knew that neither of them were angels, B'Elanna with her volatile temper and Seven's ice-cold condescension would undoubtedly lead to sparks at some stage, but now they both displayed the maturity and love for each other to weather any storm.</P>
<P>Chakotay requesting her presence on the bridge jogged Janeway out of her musings.</P>
<P>"Now what?" she muttered to herself as she made her way to the bridge. They weren't due to arrive at the planet's co-ordinates for another 2 hours.</P>
<P>"Report?" she took her seat as her first officer made room for her(on his lap)</P>
<P>"We have discovered some unusual reading from the planet," Tuvok intoned gravely. "Seven has confirmed them via sensor readings."</P>
<P>"The planet is encased within a strange phenomena," Chakotay took up the story. "The closest we've got to analysing the phenomena is that it's some form of electromagnetic pulse in the outer stratoshere."</P>
<P>Janeway frown slightly, that didn't sound too serious. " On screen."</P>
<P>The red-brown planet flashed up on the view screen.</P>
<P>Janeway looked round. "Looks fine to me."</P>
<P>"Ma'am, Seven made some modifications to the standard sensors scans and using them, we get this." Harry fiddled with his console and a new image appeared in the screen, this time there clearly could be seen a swirling mist of static charges and pules surrounding the planet.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna doesn't think that a warp field can be sustained within this phenomena," Chakotay said, handing a data padd to the Captain.</P>
<P>"Would this explain why we couldn't detect any ion trails?" Janeway asked as she scrolled through the information.</P>
<P>"I guess it's possible." Harry didn't sound too sure.</P>
<P>Tom, who had been pretty much silent up until now turned from the helm to face the Captain and Chakotay.</P>
<P>"Surely a race that's supposedly quite advanced should have found a way to combat the effects of that, that ... whatever it is," he gestured to the viewscreen.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Paris has made a valid point, Captain." Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Don't sound so surprised, Tuvok. I can come up with a gem every so often," Tom grinned as he swung back to his console.</P>
<P>"Indeed." Tuvok merely raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Fact is we don't know whether they've broken the warp barrier or not. For all we know, they could be a race that just simply like to stay home," Chakotay shrugged.</P>
<P>"I don't think so, not with all that technology we detected," Harry objected.</P>
<P>"We're not going to get any where by speculating," Janeway called a halt to the discussion.  </P>
<P>"First things first, we need to find whether we can even get near the planet. Chakotay, get B'Elanna to work on a way to cut through that stuff. Harry, you give her a hand. And while you're at it, see what effect this thing will have on our transporters," Janeway got up a walked to the turbolift, still firing instruction to her first officer </P>
<P>"Have the doctor find out whether it will have any effect on the crew. I'm going to Astrometrics to find out more about this latest challenge." She was grinning as the doors swished closed.</P>
<P>Chakotay grinned, the Captain did so like a challenge.</P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna sat on the sofa in her quarters in her tank top and trousers, her jacket and boots dumped on the floor by the door. She was tired. No, she was bone weary. It had taken over a week of working round the clock to protect the warp core and the engines so that Voyager could get within a light year of the planet, let alone enter their atmosphere. She and Harry had finally managed to find a way of transporting through the magnomemetic field as the Kalahari called it.</P>
<P>Janeway had initiated contact via communications and negotiations seemed to be going well. After an initial bout of natural wariness they were willing to open up a limited trade agreement with Voyager. A delegation of Kalahari ministers was due to beam to Voyager in a few days time and if all went well the Captain would visit the planet soon after. </P>
<P>B'Elanna tried to review her list of things to finish up but she was too tired. She wasn't even sure what day it was. She was hungry and irritable, she couldn't remember when last she got to talk to Seven, let alone spend time with her. And that pissed the Klingon off. They had got into the routine of leaving messages for each other in B'Elanna's quarters and though it was kind of fun to read Seven's love notes, she wanted the real thing. The only consolation had been that instead of regenerating, Seven often slept in B'Elanna's bed and even though their brutal work schedule meant that they hadn't managed to share a night together, B'Elanna's sheets always retained a faint hint of Seven's unique fragrance and that helped B'Elanna to sleep.</P>
<P>B'Elanna needed to wind down a little before hitting the shower and bed, she was over-tired and jumpy.</P>
<P>"Computer, play classical file alpha 1, maximum volume." she instructed. As soon as the strains of the violin washed over her, B'Elanna felt her heart rate slow and her body relax. This was one of her favourite pieces of classical earth music. It always brought her calm.</P>
<P>She leaned back and closed her eyes, a small smile playing on her lips. Sensing something, she snapped her eyes open and her jaw dropped as a very sleepy, scantily clothed drone padded out of her bedroom.</P>
<P>"Computer, stop playback." She opened her arms as Seven sat down beside her on the sofa and snuggled up, sighing happily as she wrapped her arms around B'Elanna. It was evident she was still half-asleep. Her hair fell down to her shoulders and she was wearing a shirt that B'Elanna often wore to bed. It was huge on the tiny Klingon, but on Seven it barely skimmed her shapely hips.</P>
<P>Seven, I'm sorry, honey, I didn't check." B'Elanna gently stroked the long blond tresses and placed a kiss on her forehead.</P>
<P>"Mmmmm."</P>
<P>"You ok?" B'Elanna was amused at the sleepy drone.</P>
<P>"Mmmmm. Play the music again, I found it pleasing."</P>
<P>As the music began to play, B'Elanna realised that she couldn't think of a time when she'd been happier. The feeling that the music gave her coupled with having Seven practically curled up on her lap made her heart soar. The tiredness and irritations of the day melted away.</P>
<P>"I am that bird, d'you know that?" B'Elanna whispered softly into Seven's hair. She thought that Seven had fallen asleep in her arms and couldn't hear her. "I am soaring, higher and higher above the clouds and the sea." </P>
<P>She kissed her beloved's forehead again. "You do that to me, do you know that? You make me as free as a bird. "</P>

<P>By the time B'Elanna woke the next morning, Seven had already left. They had spent the night on the sofa, wrapped in each other's arms. But despite that, B'Elanna felt relaxed and properly rested.</P>
<P>She stood, stretched and yawned expansively as she made her way to the bathroom, when a flat parcel caught her eye.</P>
<P>She strolled over to it curiously, it had been wrapped by what could only be borg precision, but when she finally opened it her heart stopped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was entitled <B>Lark Ascending</B> and it depicted two larks floating in clear blue skies.</P>
<P>There was a small inscription on the back of the painting. </P>
<I><P>Only when I am with you, am I truly free. </P>
</I><P> </P>
<hr>

<P>"I'm telling you, Tom, I just don't trust them. There's something that just doesn't feel right."</P>
<P>B'Elanna and Tom were eating in the mess hall. They had both come back from the Kalahari planet where they had both been involved in various cultural exchanges. </P>
<P>The Captain and the Kalahari First Minister had agreed a trade package where Voyager could get all the supplies and resources that they needed and the crew would offer in exchange their cultural diversity and technical expertise. Despite appearing to be a technologically advanced race, the Kalahari were a race that borrowed and bought technology rather than creating their own advances. </P>
<P>"How do you mean?"</P>
<P>"I can't really explain it, but I can't seem to trust a race of people that don't develop their own technology and simply use someone else's. It doesn't seem right."</P>
<P>"Yeah well they all sure look good," Tom grinned.</P>
<P>"Sure if you like tall, gangly, violet eyed albinos. How the hell is it that they all look almost identical? And what's with all those other species that seem to visit and never leave?"</P>
<P>"You're just paranoid," Tom said lazily. He looked up as Seven approached their table.</P>
<P>"May I join you," she asked politely.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked up at Seven through her lashes, smiling lightly. Though they had not hidden their relationship from anyone, Seven was always strictly professional with B'Elanna while they were on duty. </P>
<P>"Sure, Seven, take a seat." Tom invited, grinning wickedly.</P>
<P>Seven slid in the seat beside Tom, so that she could be opposite B'Elanna who immediately pushed her tray away and leaned forward, picking up Seven's hands.</P>
<P>"Been back to the planet?" B'Elanna asked idly as she stroked the back of the borgs hands with her thumbs. She knew that Seven's hands were incredibly sensitive and this gentle caress always distracted her. B'Elanna's smile widened as she saw Seven's pupils dilate.</P>
<P>"Seven? The planet?" B'Elanna teased.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed hard and tried to concentrate.</P>
<P>"I have completed my duties updating the Kalahari sensor arrays and the Captain has assigned me to work with you to complete the matrix conversion. Lieutenant, I need my hands to consume my meal." </P>
<P>She licked her lips, her mouth having gone dry at the sensations the simple caresses were having on her. Her legs felt weak.</P>
<P>"You only need one hand to eat," B'Elanna relented, freeing one hand. Her eyes narrowed at the sight of Seven's pink tongue and she growled very softly, knowing that only Seven would be able to pick up the faint sound.</P>
<P>Seven dropped her fork.</P>
<P>"Would the pair of you knock it off, I'm trying to eat here," Tom complained.</P>
<P>"Tom, get lost." B'Elanna didn't take her eyes off Seven, who was having trouble breathing.</P>
<P>"You've been together months now, surely. Yet you're both acting like ...." He paused and looked from B'Elanna to Seven.</P>
<P>"Shut up, Tom." He was one of the few people who could actually make her blush.</P>
<P>"You haven't done it yet, have you?" he was laughing openly.</P>
<P>"What is it that we have not yet done?" Seven asked (innocently)</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned to look at her, her eyes narrowed, was Seven giving her a little payback?</P>
<P>"You know, the nasty" Tom elaborated.</P>
<P>"I am sure what B'Elanna and I have planned will be anything but nasty." She gave her stunned love a slow wink and continued with her meal.</P>
<P>"I know this is new to you both and all, but what's the hold up. D'you want me to draw you a diagram?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna finally look her eyes off Seven and turned to Tom.</P>
<P>"If you don't leave now, I'm going to break your neck. Understood?" She smiled sweetly as she uttered the threat.</P>
<P>Tom picked up his tray, still laughing.</P>
<P>"Enjoy. And I don't mean just the meal."</P>
<P>"Now, where was I?" B'Elanna turned her intent and hungry stare back at the ex-drone.</P>
<P>"Feed me." </P>
<P>Seven was startled at the request. She looked at B'Elanna to see if she was serious and her blue gaze met head on with hot burning coals of desire.</P>
<P> She had no real vanity, but the fact that the inordinately beautiful and intelligent engineer desired her, filled Seven with a warm, sweet pleasure.</P>
<P>"Feed me," B'Elanna repeated the request, this time with a throaty growl.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seven picked a piece of meat from her plate with her fingers and dipped it in the spicy sauce. She leaned over the table and carefully carried the morsel to B'Elanna's lips, and popped the piece in, making sure to brush those full lips as she did. She didn't take her eyes off the Klingon as she repeated the action, this time her fingers straying for a second inside the warm, moist cavern of B'Elanna's mouth.</P>
<P>"More?" she asked the question coolly, but inside she was on fire</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded, mutely enjoying every minute of the seduction. They were both completely oblivious to their surroundings. Nothing else existed for them except each other.</P>
<P>This time, Seven allowed her fingers to stay a little longer and was rewarded when B'Elanna sucked and nibbled before releasing them. A drop of sauce had strayed to the corner of B'Elanna's mouth and though Seven was dying to lick it off, she contented herself by brushing her thumb over the drop and B'Elanna's lower lip and slowly sucking her digit clean.</P>
<P>"Janeway to Torres."</P>
<P>The Captain's voice bought them both crashing to earth. Blinking, B'Elanna responded.</P>
<P>"Torres here, Captain." Her voice was very throaty.</P>
<P>"Are you alright, Lieutenant?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna cleared her throat hurriedly," Fine, Captain. What can I do for you?"</P>
<P>"I'd like you to come to my ready room to work out a schedule of completion of the Kalahari request."</P>
<P>"I'll be there, right away, Captain."</P>
<P>"Acknowledged. Janeway out."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled ruefully at Seven. </P>
<P>"The Captains interruption, though frustrating, was undoubtedly fortuitous." Seven observed calmly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna could read Seven's emotions like a book and knew that her darling was anything but calm, regardless of appearances.</P>
<P>"How so? I, for one would have been quite happy to continue." She protested.</P>
<P>"Had we continued, I have no doubt that we would have resulted in making love, right here in the mess hall." The was a wealth of amusement and something deeper in her comment.</P>
<P>B'Elanna grinned slightly at that and stood, preparing to leave. She rested her hand on Seven's nape and stroked it gently, she knew that Seven loved it.</P>
<P>"As soon as I've finished with the Captain, I need to return to the planet. Come with me?"</P>
<P>"Of course."</P>
<P>"Good. I..., I'll see you later."</P>
<P>An emotion, something that Seven couldn't quite identify flickered in B'Elanna's eyes and then she was gone.</P>
<I>
<P>You are such a coward. Why can't you just tell her? They're just 3 little words. You are such a spineless little wimp.</P>
</I><P>B'Elanna continued to berate herself all the way the Captain's ready room.</P>
<I>
<P>What's the worse that could happen? She says she's not in love with you. So what? Life goes on and besides, you KNOW Seven's in love with you. It's written all over her face every time she sees you. She probably expects you to take a lead. Have a little faith in her. Trust her.</P>
</I>
<P>She arrived at the Captain's ready room, feeling much better. Janeway was munching on a snack when the engineer announced herself.</P>
<P>"Ah, B'Elanna, would you like to join me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna couldn't help the smirk that sprang to her face. "Thank you, Captain. I've just eaten."</P>
<P>How's the work going with the Kalahari? Tuvok, Neelix and I have completed enough cultural exchanges to last me a lifetime. We've visited the Arts Sectors, the Spiritual Centre and the Literature Division. We've seen their farming techniques but very little in the way of science and technology. Do you have any insight on this?"</P>
<P>"It was my intention to provide you with a full report once this mission is over ..."</P>
<P>"I know you've got your hands full replenishing our supplies, working on the engines and working with the Kalahari. I just wanted a little background information. The First Minister and his delegation are always very evasive whenever I broach the subject and since we are getting more than we ever thought possible in terms of resources, I didn't want to push it," Janeway explained.</P>
<P>B'Elanna folded her arms and considered the Captain, she knew the information  would piss the Captain off, big time.</P>
<P>"The Kalahari have no real technology of their own. From what Harry and I gather, over the last couple of millennia, they've borrowed or bought most of their so-called technological advances. Even the magnomemetic field comes from another species, it's not a natural phenomena and one of its functions is to preserve the climate of the planet." B'Elanna continued, getting more irate as she listed a catalogue of inadequacies.</P>
<P>"They couldn't be bothered to try and find a way of beating it, they just shrugged their shoulders and that was it. The only reason they don't have warp drive technology is because they are too lazy to try and work around that field of theirs."</P>
<P>Janeway's eyebrows nearly disappeared into her hairline. To say she was surprised was putting it mildly.</P>
<P>"I know how badly we need their resources, which is why I haven't said anything, but the only thing my team and I have been doing these last 3 weeks is repairing or updating or maintenance of all their mechanical infrastructure and technology."</P>
<P>"How is it even possible to live that way?"</P>
<P>"They do have some so-called engineers who see to the day to day running of things and they seem to have a fair number of alien species who've apparently mated with a Kalahari and become some sort of technical assistant."</P>
<P>"I'm astounded, they have clearly developed incredible artist and musicians and writers and, and great thinkers. How in the world could they have neglected the sciences?"</P>
<P>"I don't even know where to start on that one, Captain."</P>
<P>B'Elanna wondered if she should mention Nordik, the technician who'd been assigned to work with her, but decided against it. The huge lurking male would get over his crush on her soon enough and besides, they were due to leave the planet in another few days. Nothing much could happen in a few days.</P>
