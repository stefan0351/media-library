<!-- Bound \ Chapter 18 - Somnambulist II. NC17 -->

<P>(just suspend disbelief, alright)</P>
<P>B'Elanna lay on her bed and tried to make sense of the events of the day. She was confused and unsettled. She couldn't get neither rest nor comfort in this condition, she had been tossing and turning for hours, her mind replaying the incident with Seven in Astrometrics earlier.</P>
<P>It was as if Seven had been pouring out her heart to her in Astrometrics, almost talking about a love that the Borg had for her, a long-standing and committed love.</P>
<I><P>How could Seven possibly be in love with me. I'm just imagining things.</P>
</I>
<P>But the thought of the intense drone having feelings for her, loving her was ... exciting. It made her tremble, it made B'Elanna want to explore these feelings. It made her remember the feeling of being cherished by Seven, even if it was only a dream. It made her examine her own feelings for the Borg. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was always honest with herself and she realised that piece by piece, her guarded, prickly and difficult heart was quickly becoming irretrievably lost to a certain beautiful, coolly sarcastic ex-drone. </P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly drifted into a light sleep, thinking only of Seven.</P>

<P>Seven's eyes snapped open at the sound, she sat up in her bed, quickly, trying to pinpoint the source of the noise that woke her from her sleep. It was the outer door leading into her quarters. Someone had by-passed the locks to get in.</P>
<P>As she was about to call for the lights, her midnight intruder walked slowly into her bedroom and came up to the bed.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven called out softly, not wanting to startle the engineer. Her eyes were open but unfocused, as they had been the night before. But even in the darkness, Seven could tell that there was something different about B'Elanna's expression. Gone was the vacant empty stare, it was replaced by something determined almost ferocious.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna try to wake up." Seven wasn't really surprised that the Klingon had managed to work her way around two sets of locked doors. She recalled the conversation she had with the Doctor early that morning,</P>

<hr>

<P>"B'Elanna is intelligent and highly resourceful, Doctor. Merely locking her in her quarters is a futile exercise. She will undoubtedly find a way out if that is her intention."</P>
<P>"Yes, I'm sure, but I intend to use a randomly rotating frequency on her quarters, I'm sure that will keep her in."</P>
<P>Seven didn't like the idea one little bit.</P>
<P>"What if there's an emergency, how will she escape?"</P>
<P>"Ah, I've thought of that. The computer will be instructed to beam the Lieutenant directly to sickbay in the event of any problems." The EMH beamed at his own ingenuity. "So, you see, Seven, there's nothing to worry about."</P>
<P>"We shall see." Seven was less than impressed.</P>
<P>"There is one other matter I need to discuss with you, Doctor." Seven stared steadily at the hologram even though she could feel the flush rising.</P>
<P>"Oh?"</P>
<P>"Last night, B'Elanna asked me to stay with her."</P>
<P>"And did you?"</P>
<P>"I did."</P>
<P>The doctor looked at her questioningly, " Well, what seems to be the problem? You merely gave comfort to a friend in need."</P>
<P>"What if she wants more than comfort next time?" Seven forced herself to stand still, despite the blush rampaging across her elegant features.</P>
<P>"More than comfort? Like what?" </P>
<P>Seven directed an arch look at the doctor without speaking.</P>
<P>Comprehension dawned.</P>
<P>"Oh."</P>
<P>"Oh, I see. Quite a moral dilemma. Would you be taking advantage of her, even though it's something that she obviously wants? Or at least her subconscious does. Well, try not to worry about that eventuality. I doubt it will come to that, what with my brilliant plan to keep Lieutenant Torres out of mischief."</P>
<P>"I do not share you optimism, Doctor."</P>

<hr>

<P>She was right not to trust the doctor's plan.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, wake up."</P>
<P>B'Elanna didn't respond, she seemed intent on something else. She got on the bed and crawled towards Seven.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, you must wake up." Seven's voice was a little louder, this was getting out of hand.</P>
<P>"Seven." B'Elanna's voice was low. She was still asleep but turned slightly towards Seven as she heard her voice.</P>
<P>B'Elanna crawled right on to top Seven forcing her to lie down. She framed the Borg's head in her hands and leaned in to place a gentle kiss on her lips. A small sigh escaped Seven's lips at the contact and the still sleeping Klingon picked up on the sound, growling in her throat in pleasure. She begun to kiss Seven with determination, her tongue exploring, plundering Seven's mouth. She demanded a response and Seven was powerless to deny her, responding to the kisses, her own tongue thrusting deep into B'Elanna's mouth.</P>
<P>The need for oxygen didn't stop the determined Klingon, she just turned her attention to something else. Her mouth traced the curve of Seven's jaw and worked its way slowly to her throat, placing gentle kisses and little nibbling bites along the way. </P>
<P>Seven made another attempt to halt proceedings, she put her hands on B'Elanna's shoulders to stop her. It didn't have the desired effect, or maybe it did.</P>
<P>B'Elanna grasped Seven's wrists and held them together in her hand, above Seven's head. It gave the Klingon unfettered access to Seven's body and her free hand quickly took advantage, trailing a path of caresses up and down the drone's body, causing her to squirm with pleasure. </P>
<P>B'Elanna lips moved along Seven's collarbone and stopped when she felt the fluttering pulse at the base of her throat. Her tongue flicked out and lapped at the perspiration that had collected there.</P>
<P>"Oh God, B'Elanna."  </P>
<P>She released one of Seven's wrists and brought it up to her mouth, kissing the inner wrist, nuzzling at the delicate bones. She gently sank her teeth into the soft skin, not breaking it, but leaving her mark.</P>
<P>"Oh my God, B'Elanna." There was a slight but delicious pain at the nip, tremors of pleasure coursing through Seven's body.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sat up and straddled Seven, tossing the bedclothes away, her hands ruthlessly ridding Seven of the night-shirt she wore to bed. Her hands seemed to know exactly what they wanted as they went straight to the alabaster mounds, her fingers teasing, stroking the undersides of Seven's breast, slowly circling the darkened nipples, barely grazing them.</P>
<P> By this time Seven was long past coherent thought. She couldn't get enough oxygen into her lungs and was panting, wanting so much more.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, please," Seven pleaded, brokenly. She wasn't even sure what she was begging for, only that she needed it now, her body was on fire, and every nerve was on alert, attuned to B'Elanna's touch.</P>
<P>B'Elanna leaned over and took a stiff nipple in her mouth, sucking gently on the erect deep pink tip. The jagged groan that came from deep within Seven, prompted her to suck even harder. Her hand was busy, ensuring that the other beautiful breast was not neglected, massaging the soft flesh, her fingers plucking at the nipple, playing with it. She switched sides suddenly, her mouth fastening on to the second nipple, this time flicking the turgid tip with her tongue, which brought another strangled moan from Seven. </P>
<P>B'Elanna leaned back a fraction and blew softly on the glistening tip, she seemed to enjoy the way it tightened even further at the stimulus. But Seven wanted, needed the contact and thrusting a hand into the cloud of brown hair, she gently propelled her lover's head back to its task. </P>
<P>Seven arched up and released a shuddering moan as she felt the sharp teeth grazing the nipple, nipping it ever so gently. She couldn't take much more of this, her body covered in a fine sheen of sweat, every muscle straining, she felt completely weak, but she wanted more.</P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly moved down to Seven's ribcage, taking her time, giving every inch of skin her equal attention, kissing and gently biting her way down to Seven's navel. She seemed to have a special interest in the sexy indentation and spent long sensual minutes lapping at it and swirling her tongue in it. </P>
<P>She gently spread Seven's legs apart and began to drop open-mouthed kisses along the milky white inner thighs. But she did so agonisingly slowly. A kiss here, a soft bite there, her tongue trailing a path of white hot fire closer and closer to Seven's centre, but then backing up a little, to pay some more attention to a millimetre of missed skin. Closer and closer and then back again.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna don't do this to me. I need you now." Seven whispered, her soul on fire.</P>
<P>B'Elanna instantly complied, her mouth zeroing on the soft petals of flesh, her tongue making its presence felt.</P>
<P>She probed Seven's centre with her tongue, pushing further and further and then withdrawing completely, the tip circling the entrance and then probing yet again. Seven's hips were bucking wildly, she was almost out of her head with passion.</P>
<P>B'Elanna moved her attention to the bundle of nerves that were begging for attention. This time she wasn't playing, she took the nub between her teeth and bit gently, immediately stroking it with her tongue. </P>
<P>Seven felt herself rise off the bed as a throaty scream left her lips. She knew that if that didn't wake B'Elanna nothing would.</P>
<P>But nothing could deter B'Elanna from her mission. She began to suck in earnest on Seven, giving her more pleasure than the Borg though was possible. Both her hands were buried deep within B'Elanna's hair urging her closer and closer. </P>
<P>Seven felt herself get closer ... and ooooh closer to the edge of the universe, wanting B'Elanna with her when she spiralled off, but she couldn't keep the thought, any thought in her head. B'Elanna had driven her completely out of her mind but as she came, violently and explosively, there was only one word on her lips.</P>
<P>B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna.......</P>
<P>She collapsed back on the bed, her body, every muscle trembling. She felt completely boneless, and there were pinpricks of light behind her eyes, as the sensations continued to shudder through her body, still strong. She could barely keep her eyes open, B'Elanna's lovemaking had completely worn her out. B'Elanna had crawled back up, draped herself over Seven's body and lay her head on the soft bosom.</P>
<P>"Love you, Seven." B'Elanna's words were mumbled as she sank into a deeper sleep.</P>
<P>"I love you too, B'Elanna."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, can you hear me?" Seven whispered. It broke her heart that there was no response. In the morning, B'Elanna would have no idea of the love that they had just shared, of the incredible gift that she had given Seven.</P>
<P>"I love you so much, B'Elanna. I will live all of my days, content, simply to love you."</P>
<P>Seven felt herself drifting off to sleep but wanted to say the words out loud. "Even if you never remember our love, I will never forget."</P>
