<!-- Bound \ Chapter 3 - New Emotions -->

<P>It was a few days after her chat with Tom about taking Seven as a partner and B'Elanna had finally stopped blushing. She was off-duty in her quarters relaxing. Apart from work and the occasional staff meeting, she hadn't had to opportunity to speak to Seven at all. To tell the truth, she'd been avoiding her. Each time B'Elanna thought about visiting the ex-drone or inviting her to her quarters to share a meal or just to talk, unbidden images sprang to mind. Images that made her hearts pound painfully and made her body ache.</P>
<I><P>Get a grip and get over yourself. What makes you think that Seven would even be interested in you anyway?</I>  B'Elanna looked around the quarters they were fit for company, and anyway she didn't need to stand on ceremony with Seven.</P>
<P>She tapped her combadge.</P>
<P>"Torres to Seven of Nine"</P>
<P>"Go ahead, Lieutenant," came the crisp response.</P>
<P>"I've not seen you in days, why don't you come over when your shift ends, I could replicate something and we could chill out for a while," B'Elanna invited. Strangely, she felt a little nervous even though Seven had spent lots of time in her quarters.</P>
<P>"I am no longer on duty and your invitation is acceptable, I will join you shortly. Seven out."</P>
<I><P>That wasn't so hard now, was it?</I> B'Elanna was still nervous and she knew the reason why.</P>
<P>She was setting the table and her hands were full when the doorbell went (you know what I mean). </P>
<P>"Seven, you know the code," B'Elanna called out. She had given Seven the code months back so that she could have a place to relax when she wasn't on duty.</P>
<P>The door opened and Seven walked in, she hovered in the doorway for a split second and then came all the way in.</P>
<P>"Hi" B'Elanna looked over at her friend who smiled slightly and started to help with the dishes.</P>
<P>Seven was quiet as she placed the crockery in precisely the right places. <I>B'Elanna is relaxed and casual, the way that she usually is with me but she is nervous. Her heart rate and temperature are elevated</I>. She took a quick look as the Klingon unloaded the replicator. She was out of uniform wearing her favourite denim trousers. They were very old and faded and had shrunk because B'Elanna had insisted in washing them in the most inefficient manner possible. By hand and in water. The side effect was that the denim clung to every curve of the Lieutenant's shapely body. As usual, when she was relaxing, B'Elanna was barefoot and had neglected to fasten the top button of her jeans. She wore a short white sleeveless top and each time she stretched, her toned, coffee - coloured abdomen was exposed. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seven's throat was dry. The emotions she experienced when she pissed B'Elanna off were washing over her in gentle waves. They were most distracting.</P>
<P>B'Elanna tapped her gently on the shoulder.</P>
<P>"Hey, why so quiet, food's ready."</P>
<P>Seven forced herself to concentrate and looked over the meal that her friend had prepared. It was a West African dish of jollof rice and fried plantain, chicken and steamed vegetables. </P>
<P>She looked up, surprised.</P>
<P>"This is one of my favourite meals, thank you."</P>
<P>"Well you've not been over for a while..."</P>
<P>"12 days exactly," Seven interjected.</P>
<P>"Exactly, so why not?"</P>
<P>The two women ate and B'Elanna talked about her day, but her mind was on something else. She knew that she was in a heightened state of arousal but didn't know what to do about it. Her acute Klingon senses had picked up the clean, fresh and sweet smell of Seven's skin the minute she walked in, but B'Elanna was used to that. What she wasn't used to was the desire she now had to taste that skin. A desire that was getting stronger by the minute.</P>
<P>Seven had already noted that B'Elanna's eyes were now completely black and that her pupils had dilated.</P>
<P>She put down her cutlery, "B'Elanna I need to ask you something," she stated.</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked a few times to clear the image of her sucking on Seven's lucious skin, that place where her shoulder meets her neck and paid attention.</P>
<P>"Shoot"</P>
<P>"Why have you been avoiding me? Have I done something to offend you?"</P>
<P>"Shit." B'Elanna closed her eyes for a beat, "Sorry, didn't mean to swear."</P>
<P>The thought of lying didn't even cross her mind. "Seven you've done nothing to offend me, I've had something on my mind and it's been distracting that's all." </P>
<P>Idly, B'Elanna wondered if her reply would satisfy Seven. Her filthy mind then suggested several other ways of satisfying Seven.</P>
<P>"If you had a problem, perhaps it would help to share it with me. I may be able to help ease your discomfort." Seven said the words in all sincerity and, it should be noted, all innocence.</P>
<P>B'Elanna gulped. <I>Does she know what she's doing to me? </I>The thought of Seven easing her discomfort made her tremble.</P>
<P> She put her fork down before she dropped it and used her napkin to dab her brow. She wasn't surprised to find that she was sweating.</P>
<I><P>Get a grip and stop acting like a randy teenager.</I> She said to herself sternly.</P>
<P>"Seven, it's nothing serious, honestly," she bluffed. Any minute now she was going to start blushing and that would open a whole new can of worms.</P>
<P>"Does it have anything to do with the conversation you had with Tom Paris 3 days ago?"</P>
<P>"Shit. Shit."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her curiously, "I have often noted that you normally resort to profanity when you have been caught out in a deception of some sort. Is that the case now?"  She raised her ocular implant imperiously.</P>
<P>"Have you been deceiving me in some way B'Elanna Torres?"</P>
<P>"Fucking hell, Seven." She said the words calmly enough but she knew that she had to give a pretty thorough explanation in order that she didn't loose Seven's trust. She also knew that she was blushing like there was no tomorrow.</P>
<P>"You are blushing, your pupils are dilated, your heart rate is highly elevated and your breathing is rapid." Seven noted dispassionately.</P>
<P>"Oh Kahless," B'Elanna moaned out loud.</P>
<P>"Do you wish to..." Seven started</P>
<P>"Don't say it Seven," B'Elanna interrupted her before things got completely out of hand. She took a deep breath and started.</P>
<P>"This is the thing," she looked over at the ever-loveable Borg and got lost in her gorgeous blue (I swear they're grey) eyes.</P>
<P>"The thing is? " Seven prompted.</P>
<P>"Yeah, right, the thing is that Tom, that motherfucker Tom Paris, made some suggestions to me erm, er, about you, that kinda made me a little jittery that's all. Honest." <I>Please Kahless, please don't let her ask what kind of suggestions</I>.</P>
<P>"What kind of suggestions?"</P>
<I><P>Thanks for nothing.</I> B'Elanna swallowed hard, time to bite the bullet. <I>What's the worse that could happen? Seven will be amused or she'll break Tom's neck. Either way she doesn't get to know about me lusting after her and I get let off the hook. It's a win - win situation.</P>
</I>
<P>"OK, I don't want you to be upset. But it was about us become lovers as well as friends."</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked over at her friend carefully; Seven was watching her like a hawk but had made no comment.</P>
<P>"Seven," B'Elanna croaked fearfully.</P>
<P>"Acceptable."</P>
<P>"What!" B'Elanna couldn't help it; she jumped out of her seat, sending the chair crashing over.</P>
<P>"Wha.., what do you mean, <I>Acceptable</I>. Are you nuts?" Her voice raised to a near shout and she was hopping from one foot to the other, unable to keep still. </P>
<P>"Do you know what you're saying? Did you hear what I said?"</P>
<P>The conversation was going wrong on so many levels. B'Elanna's heart were pounding so hard, she felt sure they were going to burst out of her chest. She was thrilled and terrified at the same time and to make matters worse, Seven had got out of her seat and was following her about the room, almost stalking her.</P>
<P>"I find the suggestion of us being mates acceptable. As you have pointed out we have become good friends, we share many common interests and we are both sexually attracted to one another. We are a natural choice."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about, we are not a natural choice, we're both women," B'Elanna almost shouted at the blond.</P>
<P>Seven merely raised her ocular implant.</P>
<P>"And, and what do you mean, we are both sexually attracted to each other?" The minute the question was out, B'Elanna  knew she should have left that one well alone.</P>
<P>"I had noted that often, during your abortive marriage to Tom Paris you were frequently sexually frustrated. You relived these frustrations by fighting with me. All the symptoms that you have been experiencing since I entered the room are evident each time we meet or argue. I know that you desire me.</P>
<P>I also know that my body aches for you and your touch. My stomach drops as soon as I hear your voice , it hurts when you are not there but I can not concentrate when you are near me, like now."</P>
<P>B'Elanna was mesmerised and didn't notice how close Seven had got.</P>
<P>Seven lifted a strand of B'Elanna's hair and let it run through her fingers. "The scent of your skin is intoxicating I want to taste it, I want to touch you, all of you." B'Elanna had stopped breathing and couldn't even begin to start thinking, so she looked up into Seven's eyes. Big mistake. The pupils had taken up most of the blue iris; her eyes were almost black with desire.</P>
<P>Seven took up B'Elanna's hand and placed on her chest, just above her bosom. </P>
<P>"Can you feel my heart, can you feel it Lanna?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded dumbly, it felt like a drum pounding, faster and faster. Seven lowered her head, her mouth mere fractions away from the uncharacteristically silent half-Klingon.</P>
<P>"My heart is beating for you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her lips and inadvertently flicked at Seven's upper lip with the tip of her tongue. She wasn't prepared for the jolt of desire that crashed though her at the tiniest of contact. She was even more shocked at the moan that came from Seven. She nearly came at the sound, but it brought her to her senses.</P>
<P>She took a step back from Seven and broke the contact. She gestured to the sofa.</P>
<P>"Seven, please sit, we need to talk."</P>
<P>Seven wanted to argue, she wanted to continue her closeness with the Lieutenant, but she bided her time. For now.</P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her ridges and closed her eyes. <I>How in the name of all that is holy, did I get myself into this mess?</P>
</I>
<P>"Seven, I won't try to deny it. I am attracted to you, on lots of different levels. I mean your brain is remarkable, you're loyal, and you want the best for Voyager. You're beautiful...." she looked at the ex-drone and got lost again, "God, you are so beautiful." She shook her head to bring her back to the present. She sat down beside Seven and picked up her Borg-enhanced hand. B'Elanna traced the implants along the slender, pale hand, not trusting herself to look into those eyes again.</P>
<P>"You are still very much a child when it comes to emotions and sexuality. I have never, ever considered being with a woman, despite my feelings for you and I'm not honestly sure that I could. It's wouldn't be right for me to take you, take your body without considering what it might mean for both of us. I'd be taking advantage of you," she risked a look at the silent woman. "Do you understand me, can you understand me?" B'Elanna knew that she was almost pleading.</P>
<P>Seven snatched her hand away and got to her feet.</P>
<P>"You are rejecting me." she stated baldly. </P>
<P>B'Elanna jumped up after her and gripped Seven by her hands.</P>
<P>"No. no, Seven. Please don't think that. Please don't think that I could ever do that to you. It's just that, it's, I'm ..." She dropped Seven's hands and rubbed her ridges in confusion.</P>
<P>"Seven, I don't know what to do. This is too new for both of us. We can't rush. I can not rush you. It wouldn't be fair. Please sit."</P>
<I><P>She has not rejected me. She has not rejected me.</I> Those were the only thoughts in Seven's head.</P>
<P>She turned her crystal blue gaze on B'Elanna. "What do you propose?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna slumped back down on the sofa and watched while Seven sat beside her.</P>
<P>"I don't know what I want," B'Elanna felt close to tears.</P>
<P>"You want me." Simple statement of fact from the former Borg.</P>
<P>"It's not as simply as that Seven. The truth is that I do want you, I want you so badly, I can't rest, I can't work, I can't think. But I don't know if I can take that step. I don't know if I want to." She covered her face in her hands.</P>
<I><P>B'Elanna is hurting. You must help her, ease her pain.</I> Seven moved over and clasped the diminutive woman in her arms and rocked her gently. She was shocked to find that B'Elanna was trembling.</P>
<P>"If you require time to consider whether you want to be with me, I am willing to wait."  She placed a gentle kiss in the cloud of dark hair and whispered softly, "I am willing to wait forever."</P>
