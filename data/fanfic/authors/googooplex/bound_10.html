<!-- Bound \ Chapter 10 - The Language of Love -->

<P>B'Elanna looked up as Nordik brush past her again. She had already explained to him that she didn't like it and that humans liked to maintain a personal space, but the message wasn't getting through. She sighed and took another deep breath. The last time he had done it, a few days ago, she had bitten his head off and he acted like a whipped puppy and made so many mistakes with his calibrations that it had set them back another 12 hours. This was, Kahless willing, their last full day and B'Elanna had given her team some much-needed time off. She and Seven, with the dubious help of Nordik, should be done by nightfall.</P>
<P>Nordik had been a bit twitchy today, but she guess it was because she was leaving. To be honest, she couldn't wait to get out of his sight. Regardless of her feeling for Seven, she didn't have any aversion to men, but Nordik made her skin crawl. </P>
<P>Tom had told her that with her dark hair, eyes and skin, she was probably every Kalahari male's wet dream as the planet was populated by tall, albino-like humanoids with violet eyes.</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled as she recalled smacking him upside the head for his impudence.</P>
<P>Seven, over at the other end of the designated science area, was becoming severely irritated by the readings, no matter have many times she checked the input or changed the variables, or ran the programme, the results from the matrix converter continued to remained the exactly the same even though she knew that it was impossible. It had taken hours to set up the parameters for the test but if she couldn't complete her task on time, it would set the whole project back. </P>
<P>And that would interfere with the time she could spend with B'Elanna. </P>
<P>Which was unacceptable.</P>
<P>She ran a diagnostic check.  Everything was working within specified parameters. Good.</P>
<P>She checked her instrument panel for misalignments. There were none. </P>
<P>She used her tricorder to run a self-diagnostic. She was working perfectly. Good.</P>
<P>Seven carried out the matrix converter programme again, and checked the readings. </P>
<P>They hadn't changed.</P>
<B><I><U><P>FUCK IT ALL TO ABSOLUTE HELL!!!</P>
</B></I></U><P>A small gasped escaped Seven's lips. She hadn't uttered the obscenities out loud, but she was shocked that she had even thought them. Her hands shot up to cover her mouth as if to prevent to words actually coming to life.</P>
<P>B'Elanna, working at the other end of the chamber, heard Seven yelp and strolled over to check if she was alright.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she questioned curiously. Seven still had her hands over her mouth and her gorgeous blue eyes were wide with amazement.</P>
<P>"What is it?"</P>
<P>Seven flushed a delicious shade of pink as she let her hands drop.</P>
<P>"I ... I thought a profanity." She was mortified.</P>
<P>"You did what?" the Klingon grinned.</P>
<P>"It came to my mind suddenly, I had no control over the words."</P>
<P>B'Elanna started to giggle, " Come on, Seven, give. What words did you think?"</P>
<P>Seven was scandalised,  " I would be inappropriate for me to repeat them," she looked around nervously. "The Kalahari might overhear me."</P>
<P>B'Elanna began to laugh so hard that she needed support.  " Tell me!"</P>
<P>Checking make sure that their hosts were out of earshot, Seven muttered, unhappily, " Fuck it all to absolute hell." </P>
<P>She blushed an even darker shade of pink and her hands were fluttering distractedly at her sides.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped laughing long enough to see Seven's discomfort.</P>
<I><P>She is an absolute angel</I>, B'Elanna thought as she caught up Seven's still fluttering hands.</P>
<P>"You are utterly adorable, do you know that?" </P>
<P>Protocol be damned she thought as she kissed Seven's fingers, still grinning. </P>
<P>"I love you so much."</P>
<P>Neither of them were prepared for that.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes widened with joy at the declaration and B'Elanna went very still.</P>
<P>She gently kissed Seven's inner wrist and took a moment to compose herself. A warm blanket of peace settled over her.</P>
<P>"Do you have any idea how good it feels to say those words to you, Seven? I love you so very much. I never want to be apart from you." B'Elanna swallowed hard, she wanted to cry. She couldn't understand why it had taken her so long to admit these feelings out loud, but now that she had, it felt so good.</P>
<P>Seven draped her hands over B'Elanna's shoulders and clasped them loosely and leaned her forehead against B'Elanna ridges.</P>
<P>"And I love you, my dearest friend."</P>
