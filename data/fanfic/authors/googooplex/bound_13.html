<!-- Bound \ Chapter 13 - Lost -->

<P>"Captain, please report to sickbay."</P>
<P>It had been a few days since the brain surgery and even though the doctor declared it a success, B'Elanna had yet to regain consciousness. The EMH attributed this to the swelling around the brain, he predicted that once the swelling went down, she would come out of her coma.</P>
<P>He also had appraised them of what to expect. B'Elanna's memory would undoubtedly be affected, most likely her most recent memories. It would take at least a couple of day's evaluation and observation to decide whether she had lost entire blocks of memory or merely gaps. It would also take time to determine whether any or all of the memory would return. The doctor thought that it was too dangerous to try and stimulate her memories to return. He wanted her to heal properly before considering it an option.</P>
<P>When the Captain got to Sickbay she found Seven at B'Elanna's side as she had been for most of the preceding month. Janeway went into the doctor's office to allow her some privacy.</P>
<P>"Doctor?"</P>
<P>"I called Seven to tell her that B'Elanna was near consciousness and that she could be here when she wakes up, just out of sight or something."</P>
<P>"That's very compassionate of you, Doctor." Janeway smiled at the hologram.</P>
<P>"I'll give her another few minutes."</P>
<P>Seven was stroking B'Elanna's hair and whispering to her softly.</P>
<P>"I do not know what will happen to us, it is possibly that you will never regain your memories. But I will not give up on you, B'Elanna. I will not give up on us. You loved me once, I know that you will love me again." She leant closer and placed a soft gentle kiss on the warm lips of the slumbering Klingon.  </P>
<P>She straightened and decided that it would be better if she left sickbay altogether, at this moment, she didn't trust herself not to break down completely, the minute she heard B'Elanna's voice. There would be time enough later.</P>
<P>With one final lingering glance, Seven strode out of sickbay.</P>
<P>Janeway and the Doctor exchanged a look but made no comment, secretly the doctor was relieved, there were too many variables as it was, he really didn't need the complication of an hysterical Borg on his hands as well.</P>
<P>He used a mild stimulant to bring B'Elanna to full consciousness.</P>
<P>They both watched anxiously as B'Elanna slowly opened her eyes and blinked groggily for a few minutes. As soon as she focused on where she was, B'Elanna immediately tried to sit up and speak.</P>
<P>"Whoa, slow down, take it easy, B'Elanna."</P>
<P>"Captain? What am I doing here? What's happened?"</P>
<P>"You were seriously injured on an away mission. How are you feeling?"</P>
<P>"My head hurts like hell and I ache all over. What happened to me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna's voice was weak and even speaking for a few moments had clearly exhausted her.</P>
<P>The Doctor intervened.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, what's the last thing you remember?" He was busily monitoring all her vitals.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sank back on the bed and closed her eyes.</P>
<P>"I was .... I was monitoring the warp core. The Xenons were attacking us for crossing their space." She shot upright as a thought occurred to her, but cried out in agony, clutching her head in both hands.</P>
<P>"The warp core ... I didn't lose it did I?" she groaned out.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna you've got to take it easy. The warp core is fine," Janeway smiled grimly. The attack by the Xenons had taken place over 10 months ago.</P>
<P>"But there was no away mission. How could I have been hurt on an away mission. When did this happen, who was I with?" she forced herself upright again.</P>
<P>"Why can't I remember?"</P>
<P>"I'll say this for her, she catches on fast," the Doctor whispered to Janeway.</P>
<P>The doctor had briefed her on this eventuality, keep it short and simple.</P>
<P>"That attack was some months ago, B'Elanna. You and Seven were working with a race called the Kalahari when you were attacked. The Doctor had to perform brain surgery. That's why you can't remember."</P>
<P>B'Elanna lay back down and eyed the Captain closely.</P>
<P>"How's Seven? Was she injured as well?"</P>
<P>"A little, but she's fine."</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes, trying to take in all the information. They snapped open as another thought occurred to her.</P>
<P>"Exactly how long have I been here?"</P>
<P>"A month." The doctor stated blithely.</P>
<P>"A MONTH!" B'Elanna shrieked and then winced at the pain.</P>
<P>"Who's been taking care on my engines?" She glared at the Captain as she asked the question.</P>
<P>"Please don't tell me you let Seven run loose in engineering?" she asked without waiting for an answer.</P>
<P>At Janeway's cautious nod, B'Elanna moaned out loud.</P>
<P>"Aww, Captain. You know she drives me nuts. I'll never find anything once I get back."</P>
<P>"Well, Lieutenant, I wouldn't worry about that for a while. You'll be in sick bay for quite a while yet. We'll have time to get reacquainted." </P>
<P>B'Elanna looked less than pleased at the prospect.</P>
<P>"Captain ...?"</P>
<P>"As long as the Doctor says, B'Elanna. And that's an order." She squeezed one of her engineer's hands. "We nearly lost you this time, I'm glad to have you back."</P>

<hr>

<P>Seven was busy supervising the maintenance sweep and taking more than a fair portion of the workload herself when the workstation she was on flashed, indicating an incoming message. She raised her ocular implant. Why didn't the individual simply hail her using their combadge?</P>
<P>"Hey, Seven. Guess who?"</P>
<P>Her throat went dry at the sight of B'Elanna on the tiny monitor. It had been a few days since B'Elanna had regained consciousness and although Seven had visited B'Elanna while she was asleep and with the other crew, this was the first time that they had spoken</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, how may I be of assistance?"</P>
<P>"Listen, Seven you've got to help me. I'm going out of my mind here in sickbay." B'Elanna looked carefully at Seven as she said the last bit.</P>
<P>"I don't mean literally, ok?"</P>
<P>Seven allowed herself a small smile, it hurt so much to see B'Elanna and not be able to tell her how much she loved her. But she was overjoyed that the strong-willed Klingon was regaining her strength.</P>
<P>"I take it that your lack of occupation in sickbay is making you .....discontent." Seven searched for the least contentious word.</P>
<P>"No, Seven, I'm bored out of my frigging mind." B'Elanna corrected succinctly.</P>
<P>"Look, Harry let it slip that you guys in engineering are conducting a maintenance sweep and I'm not going to have a go at you for running it 6 weeks early, but I would like to be involved."</P>
<P>"How?"</P>
<P>"We ...ll, I was kind of hoping that you could swing by after your shift with some of the updates."</P>
<P>Seven looked closely at B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, where is the Doctor?"</P>
<P>"I took him off-line for a few minutes. C'mon, Seven. Help me out here. If the doctor catches me out of bed, I'll never hear the end of it."</P>
<P>"The doctor has clearly determined that you are not yet fit to leave sickbay, let alone work." Seven had no intention of jeopardising B'Elanna's full return to fitness.</P>
<P>"Oh, Seven, please. I promise that all I'll do is look. You can stay with me to make sure that I don't make too many recommendations. I really need this."</P>
<P>The minute that B'Elanna pleaded, Seven felt herself weaken. She knew that she could deny B'Elanna nothing.</P>
<P>"Look at it this way," B'Elanna negotiated, not realising that she had Seven wrapped around her little finger." If you show me the updates and the schedules, I'll be able to steer you in the right direction and stuff. It'll save me ripping your head off when I get back and find that you did it all wrong." She waggled her eyebrows comically. "I'll be your best friend," B'Elanna wheedled like a small child after a favourite toy.</P>
<P>"I will comply."</P>
<P>"Thanks, Seven. I owe you one. See you later." The console winked off, ending the transmission.</P>
<P>Seven stood and stared at the black screen. She trailed her fingertips across the place that her loves' face had been.</P>
<P>"You are my best friend," she whispered softly. "You always will be."</P>

<hr>

<P>"Seven, the bottom line is that I want you to leave."</P>
<P>"I will not comply."</P>
<P>"Haven't you work in Astrometrics?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>There was a stand-off of sorts. At least B'Elanna thought it was a stand-off, she wanted the Borg out of her precious engineering. And the Borg wasn't budging.</P>
<I><P>B'Elanna why don't you just grow up a little</I>, she thought to herself as she considered the silent drone.</P>
<I>
<P>You know damn well, she's only trying to help. You're not strong enough to carry the load on your own, at least not yet. And you have to admit, she's done a great job of managing without you over the last month.</P>
</I>
<P>B'Elanna knew that that she was feeling a little insecure that was all. But she had been taking it out on Seven all shift long. She had finally been given the all clear to return to work and she had been excited and happy to get back to her precious engines, but when she got here, Seven wouldn't let her do anything. The ex-drone had been dogging her footsteps everywhere and would allow the Klingon the chance to get her hands dirty.</P>
<P>She tried for a compromise.</P>
<P>"Look, Seven. I remember that I said that I wanted to be a better friend and colleague to you, but to be honest, I don't remember how that worked out. So I have to start all over again with you. OK?"</P>
<P>Seven had no idea where this was headed but nodded anyway.</P>
<P>"I promise not to antagonise you and you promise not to piss me off either. Deal?"</P>
<P>"Deal." Seven raised her ocular implant at the bargain. "It was not my intention to ...piss you off, Lieutenant. I only wanted to help. I will leave as you requested."</P>
<P>B'Elanna felt like the biggest bitch alive, she had clearly heard the hurt in Seven's voice. She jogged up to the departing drone and grabbed her by the arm.</P>
<P>"Seven, wait up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You've been a great help. You've been wonderful. You helped me keep my sanity by sneaking those reports, all the time I was in sick bay, you kept me company. You even put up with me when I was in pain and cranky. And the first chance it get, I revert to being a Klingon ass."</P>
<P>She looked deep into those blue eyes.</P>
<P>"I do appreciate what you've done for me. I know I don't deserve it, but ..thank you."</P>
<P>Seven put her hand over the smaller brown one still holding on to her arm.</P>
<P>"May I still continue to offer my help or assistance, anything that you require?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna was slightly distracted by the warmth of Seven's hand over hers. It felt ... nice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Of course, Seven. Thank you."</P>

<P>Over the course of the next week or so, B'Elanna got fully back into the swing of things and there was no real need for Seven to spend anytime in engineering.</P>
<P>She took in badly, not knowing how to break the impasse that she appeared to be at. She needed to be close to B'Elanna but until a joint project came their way she had to settle for chance meetings in the mess hall or during the staff meetings. She tried to engage B'Elanna in conversation, but so far it had got her nowhere.</P>
