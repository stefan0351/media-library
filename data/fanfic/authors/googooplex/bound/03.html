<P>(just suspend disbelief, alright)</P>
<P>B'Elanna lay on her bed and tried to make sense of the events of the day. She was confused and unsettled. She couldn't get neither rest nor comfort in this condition, she had been tossing and turning for hours, her mind replaying the incident with Seven in Astrometrics earlier.</P>
<P>It was as if Seven had been pouring out her heart to her in Astrometrics, almost talking about a love that the Borg had for her, a long-standing and committed love.</P>
<I><P>How could Seven possibly be in love with me. I'm just imagining things.</P>
</I>
<P>But the thought of the intense drone having feelings for her, loving her was ... exciting. It made her tremble, it made B'Elanna want to explore these feelings. It made her remember the feeling of being cherished by Seven, even if it was only a dream. It made her examine her own feelings for the Borg. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was always honest with herself and she realised that piece by piece, her guarded, prickly and difficult heart was quickly becoming irretrievably lost to a certain beautiful, coolly sarcastic ex-drone. </P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly drifted into a light sleep, thinking only of Seven.</P>

<P>Seven's eyes snapped open at the sound, she sat up in her bed, quickly, trying to pinpoint the source of the noise that woke her from her sleep. It was the outer door leading into her quarters. Someone had by-passed the locks to get in.</P>
<P>As she was about to call for the lights, her midnight intruder walked slowly into her bedroom and came up to the bed.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven called out softly, not wanting to startle the engineer. Her eyes were open but unfocused, as they had been the night before. But even in the darkness, Seven could tell that there was something different about B'Elanna's expression. Gone was the vacant empty stare, it was replaced by something determined almost ferocious.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna try to wake up." Seven wasn't really surprised that the Klingon had managed to work her way around two sets of locked doors. She recalled the conversation she had with the Doctor early that morning,</P>

<hr>

<P>"B'Elanna is intelligent and highly resourceful, Doctor. Merely locking her in her quarters is a futile exercise. She will undoubtedly find a way out if that is her intention."</P>
<P>"Yes, I'm sure, but I intend to use a randomly rotating frequency on her quarters, I'm sure that will keep her in."</P>
<P>Seven didn't like the idea one little bit.</P>
<P>"What if there's an emergency, how will she escape?"</P>
<P>"Ah, I've thought of that. The computer will be instructed to beam the Lieutenant directly to sickbay in the event of any problems." The EMH beamed at his own ingenuity. "So, you see, Seven, there's nothing to worry about."</P>
<P>"We shall see." Seven was less than impressed.</P>
<P>"There is one other matter I need to discuss with you, Doctor." Seven stared steadily at the hologram even though she could feel the flush rising.</P>
<P>"Oh?"</P>
<P>"Last night, B'Elanna asked me to stay with her."</P>
<P>"And did you?"</P>
<P>"I did."</P>
<P>The doctor looked at her questioningly, " Well, what seems to be the problem? You merely gave comfort to a friend in need."</P>
<P>"What if she wants more than comfort next time?" Seven forced herself to stand still, despite the blush rampaging across her elegant features.</P>
<P>"More than comfort? Like what?" </P>
<P>Seven directed an arch look at the doctor without speaking.</P>
<P>Comprehension dawned.</P>
<P>"Oh."</P>
<P>"Oh, I see. Quite a moral dilemma. Would you be taking advantage of her, even though it's something that she obviously wants? Or at least her subconscious does. Well, try not to worry about that eventuality. I doubt it will come to that, what with my brilliant plan to keep Lieutenant Torres out of mischief."</P>
<P>"I do not share you optimism, Doctor."</P>

<hr>

<P>She was right not to trust the doctor's plan.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, wake up."</P>
<P>B'Elanna didn't respond, she seemed intent on something else. She got on the bed and crawled towards Seven.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, you must wake up." Seven's voice was a little louder, this was getting out of hand.</P>
<P>"Seven." B'Elanna's voice was low. She was still asleep but turned slightly towards Seven as she heard her voice.</P>
<P>B'Elanna crawled right on to top Seven forcing her to lie down. She framed the Borg's head in her hands and leaned in to place a gentle kiss on her lips. A small sigh escaped Seven's lips at the contact and the still sleeping Klingon picked up on the sound, growling in her throat in pleasure. She begun to kiss Seven with determination, her tongue exploring, plundering Seven's mouth. She demanded a response and Seven was powerless to deny her, responding to the kisses, her own tongue thrusting deep into B'Elanna's mouth.</P>
<P>The need for oxygen didn't stop the determined Klingon, she just turned her attention to something else. Her mouth traced the curve of Seven's jaw and worked its way slowly to her throat, placing gentle kisses and little nibbling bites along the way. </P>
<P>Seven made another attempt to halt proceedings, she put her hands on B'Elanna's shoulders to stop her. It didn't have the desired effect, or maybe it did.</P>
<P>B'Elanna grasped Seven's wrists and held them together in her hand, above Seven's head. It gave the Klingon unfettered access to Seven's body and her free hand quickly took advantage, trailing a path of caresses up and down the drone's body, causing her to squirm with pleasure. </P>
<P>B'Elanna lips moved along Seven's collarbone and stopped when she felt the fluttering pulse at the base of her throat. Her tongue flicked out and lapped at the perspiration that had collected there.</P>
<P>"Oh God, B'Elanna."  </P>
<P>She released one of Seven's wrists and brought it up to her mouth, kissing the inner wrist, nuzzling at the delicate bones. She gently sank her teeth into the soft skin, not breaking it, but leaving her mark.</P>
<P>"Oh my God, B'Elanna." There was a slight but delicious pain at the nip, tremors of pleasure coursing through Seven's body.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sat up and straddled Seven, tossing the bedclothes away, her hands ruthlessly ridding Seven of the night-shirt she wore to bed. Her hands seemed to know exactly what they wanted as they went straight to the alabaster mounds, her fingers teasing, stroking the undersides of Seven's breast, slowly circling the darkened nipples, barely grazing them.</P>
<P> By this time Seven was long past coherent thought. She couldn't get enough oxygen into her lungs and was panting, wanting so much more.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, please," Seven pleaded, brokenly. She wasn't even sure what she was begging for, only that she needed it now, her body was on fire, and every nerve was on alert, attuned to B'Elanna's touch.</P>
<P>B'Elanna leaned over and took a stiff nipple in her mouth, sucking gently on the erect deep pink tip. The jagged groan that came from deep within Seven, prompted her to suck even harder. Her hand was busy, ensuring that the other beautiful breast was not neglected, massaging the soft flesh, her fingers plucking at the nipple, playing with it. She switched sides suddenly, her mouth fastening on to the second nipple, this time flicking the turgid tip with her tongue, which brought another strangled moan from Seven. </P>
<P>B'Elanna leaned back a fraction and blew softly on the glistening tip, she seemed to enjoy the way it tightened even further at the stimulus. But Seven wanted, needed the contact and thrusting a hand into the cloud of brown hair, she gently propelled her lover's head back to its task. </P>
<P>Seven arched up and released a shuddering moan as she felt the sharp teeth grazing the nipple, nipping it ever so gently. She couldn't take much more of this, her body covered in a fine sheen of sweat, every muscle straining, she felt completely weak, but she wanted more.</P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly moved down to Seven's ribcage, taking her time, giving every inch of skin her equal attention, kissing and gently biting her way down to Seven's navel. She seemed to have a special interest in the sexy indentation and spent long sensual minutes lapping at it and swirling her tongue in it. </P>
<P>She gently spread Seven's legs apart and began to drop open-mouthed kisses along the milky white inner thighs. But she did so agonisingly slowly. A kiss here, a soft bite there, her tongue trailing a path of white hot fire closer and closer to Seven's centre, but then backing up a little, to pay some more attention to a millimetre of missed skin. Closer and closer and then back again.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna don't do this to me. I need you now." Seven whispered, her soul on fire.</P>
<P>B'Elanna instantly complied, her mouth zeroing on the soft petals of flesh, her tongue making its presence felt.</P>
<P>She probed Seven's centre with her tongue, pushing further and further and then withdrawing completely, the tip circling the entrance and then probing yet again. Seven's hips were bucking wildly, she was almost out of her head with passion.</P>
<P>B'Elanna moved her attention to the bundle of nerves that were begging for attention. This time she wasn't playing, she took the nub between her teeth and bit gently, immediately stroking it with her tongue. </P>
<P>Seven felt herself rise off the bed as a throaty scream left her lips. She knew that if that didn't wake B'Elanna nothing would.</P>
<P>But nothing could deter B'Elanna from her mission. She began to suck in earnest on Seven, giving her more pleasure than the Borg though was possible. Both her hands were buried deep within B'Elanna's hair urging her closer and closer. </P>
<P>Seven felt herself get closer ... and ooooh closer to the edge of the universe, wanting B'Elanna with her when she spiralled off, but she couldn't keep the thought, any thought in her head. B'Elanna had driven her completely out of her mind but as she came, violently and explosively, there was only one word on her lips.</P>
<P>B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna. B'Elanna.......</P>
<P>She collapsed back on the bed, her body, every muscle trembling. She felt completely boneless, and there were pinpricks of light behind her eyes, as the sensations continued to shudder through her body, still strong. She could barely keep her eyes open, B'Elanna's lovemaking had completely worn her out. B'Elanna had crawled back up, draped herself over Seven's body and lay her head on the soft bosom.</P>
<P>"Love you, Seven." B'Elanna's words were mumbled as she sank into a deeper sleep.</P>
<P>"I love you too, B'Elanna."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, can you hear me?" Seven whispered. It broke her heart that there was no response. In the morning, B'Elanna would have no idea of the love that they had just shared, of the incredible gift that she had given Seven.</P>
<P>"I love you so much, B'Elanna. I will live all of my days, content, simply to love you."</P>
<P>Seven felt herself drifting off to sleep but wanted to say the words out loud. "Even if you never remember our love, I will never forget."</P>

<P>B'Elanna heaved a deep sigh and opened her eyes, stretching luxuriously, She had slept like a baby and felt absolutely wonderful. She knew that her internal clock had woken her at 0600hrs, her normal rising time, but thanks to the doctors meddling, she wasn't on duty for another 4 hours. She decided to rise and have breakfast with her friends. </P>
<P>She also wanted to see Seven. She had come to terms with the fact that she was falling for the enigmatic Borg. Even though she had never considered a relationship with a woman before, somehow the idea of her and Seven together seemed right. Always supposing the Borg was actually interested ....B'Elanna sat up in bed and frowned. Fragments of dreams were coming back as she thought of Seven. She had been dreaming of Seven again.</P>
<P>She got out of bed grinning slightly. Jeez, I've got it bad. These dreams had been intensely erotic and B'Elanna felt her body tingle all over as she took a shower. She closed her eyes and tried to recall the details of the dream, but it all she came up with were tiny shreds of memory, sensations and flavours, all of them making her heart race.</P>
<P>She and Seven could be compatible, B'Elanna thought as she changed into her uniform, they had become pretty good friends, they shared many interests outside work and they were a brilliant team. Sure, they still had their arguments, but not the viscous hurtful fights of the past.</P>
<P>They really could make it work.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at her reflection as she prepared to leave for the mess hall. She rubbed her ridges, the way she always did when she was unsure of herself or agitated.</P>
<P>"What's the worse that could happen?" she asked the woman staring back at her from the mirror.</P>
<P>The worse that could happen would be Seven saying that she didn't want or need B'Elanna. She closed her eyes for a second, she had actually felt a physical pain at the thought of Seven not returning her affection.</P>
<P>Maybe if I take it real slow with her, not rush her into anything, she could get used to the idea. B'Elanna felt better now that she had a plan of sorts.</P>
<P>The more that she thought about Seven, the more she wanted to see her, to be close to her.</P>
<P>B'Elanna entered the mess hall and quickly found Tom and Harry.</P>
<P>"Hi guys," B'Elanna took a sat beside Harry and began to eat.</P>
<P>"Hey, B'Elanna," Tom greeted her. He looked at her plate and frowned, "What the hell are you eating?"</P>
<P>"Baked Kiwi-fruit pie," she mumbled her mouth full. B'Elanna closed her eyes and savoured the sweet, slightly tart taste of the kiwi fruit, it melted on her tongue and reminded her of something she couldn't quite place her finger on. She leaned back in her chair and growled in pleasure, her toes curling with the sheer enjoyment of the fruit.</P>
<P>"For breakfast??" Harry was a bit surprised. </P>
<P>B'Elanna opened her eyes and looked at the two men staring at her.</P>
<P>"Are you feeling alright, B'Elanna?" Tom was concerned.</P>
<P>"I'm fine. I just had this incredible craving for kiwis this morning. It tastes soo good."</P>
<P>"I'm sure. But for breakfast?" Harry was still sceptical.</P>
<P>"Anyway, what brought this craving on," Tom asked curious.</P>
<P>B'Elanna ignored them for a few minutes as she ate her dessert breakfast. She sighed in pleasure as another morsel slid down her throat and shuddered deliciously.</P>
<P>"I don't know, I was thinking of ..." She stopped as she realised that she had been thinking of Seven and those supercharged dreams of her ravishing Seven's long-limb body.</P>
<P>"I don't know what brought the craving on ..." Even as she spoke, Seven walked into the mess hall and made a beeline for their table.</P>
<P>B'Elanna dropped her fork as one or two fragments came together. She suddenly realised why she wanted the kiwi fruit so much. In her dream, she explored every intimate secret and had tasted every last inch of Seven's body. That tall, supple and incredibly beautiful body had tasted like sweet, ripe kiwi fruit.</P>
<P>She dropped her eyes, blushing violently as the Borg approached the table. If Seven could read my mind, she would run a mile. B'Elanna thought. I need to keep my lust under control. I don't want to scare her.</P>
<P>As Seven moved closer to the trio, her Borg-enhanced sense of smell detected B'Elanna's immediate arousal at her presence and she hid a small smile. Her own body responded instantly. She still ached and trembled from the loving that she had received the night before.</P>
<P>She had been shocked to find that she hadn't woken up when B'Elanna left, her body and senses completely sated by the thoroughness of B'Elanna's lovemaking. Somehow the engineer's extraordinary brain had managed to return her to her quarters unaided. </P>
<P>Seven glanced at the bruise on her inner wrist, discreetly hidden by her biosuit. She rubbed the mark with her thumb, a faint smile playing on her lips as she recalled again the manner in which B'Elanna had claimed her.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Seven greeted them all politely, but her eyes were fixed on the engineer. The guys tactfully made their excuses and quickly left, helping Seven in any way they could to bring her and B'Elanna back together again.</P>
<P>The minute B'Elanna looked up into Seven's eyes, her courage left her. The pain she had felt at the thought of Seven not returning her feeling came back, tenfold and made her feel empty and sick.</P>
<I>
<P>You need to do something. You can't just wallow in ignorance, you have to try.</I> B'Elanna said all these things to herself trying to work up the courage to tell Seven of her feelings.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, how are you feeling this morning?" Seven asked gently. She had spoken to the doctor of her intentions, and though he wasn't exactly pleased, he had assured her that B'Elanna was now pretty much emotionally strong enough to handle it.</P>
<P>"I'm fine, thanks." The Klingon forced herself to look into Seven's crystal blue eyes and clearly read the tenderness and concern in them.</P>
<P>"I spoke to the doctor, to request more information on the act of sleepwalking."</P>
<P>"Oh?" B'Elanna was a little distracted. She wanted to put her mouth on Seven's skin to see if it tasted like kiwi fruit.</P>
<P>"He tells me that sleepwalking is the sole manifestation of the subconscious carrying out actions that the conscious mind has inhibited the body from completing for some reason." Seven explained carefully, the doctor had told her that B'Elanna's memory of the night before might actually come back with very gentle prodding, unlike the memories affected by her brain surgery.</P>
<P>"How do you mean?" B'Elanna frowned not completely following. She absently noted that Seven kept rubbing her inner wrist. The action brought a vague memory to B'Elanna, something ...</P>
<P>"The night that you corrected the warp nacelles, you would have performed this duty normally if the corrections were required while you were at engineering, however, the malfunction occurred while you were asleep and your subconscious mind knew that it was important to you. Hence the trip to engineering in you night attire. Behaviour patterns displayed during sleepwalking episodes are actions that the mind is desperate to complete while awake."</P>
<P>"Seven, what are you trying to tell me," B'Elanna was trying to read between the lines.</P>
<P>"What else did I do while sleepwalking that night."</P>
<P>"You did nothing."</P>
<P>"Then why are you telling me this, I've been sleepwalking again, haven't I?"</P>
<P>Seven hesitated, B'Elanna was becoming agitated, but the engineer caught the pause.</P>
<P>"Seven, tell me. What have I done? Have I hurt someone," She grabbed at Seven's wrist trying to see </P>
<P>"Have I hurt you, Seven? Please tell me."</P>
<P>"You did not hurt me, B'Elanna." Seven responded quietly.</P>
<P>As B'Elanna stared at the bruise, she could clearly detect the bite marks. She dropped the hand as if burnt and turned grey. The memory of last night came flooding back.  It hadn't been a dream.</P>
<P>"Oh God, Seven. What have I done." She whispered brokenly. She was close to tears at the thought that she may have assaulted ... raped Seven.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, look at me," Seven instructed firmly, it was imperative that the Klingon understood that her lovemaking had not been unwelcome. Hell, it had been gratefully received.  </P>
<P>B'Elanna, her eyes filled with tears, attempted to leave the table, sickened at her actions but Seven grasped her hands and pulled her back down. She held on firmly, her piercing blue gaze forcing B'Elanna to keep eye contact.</P>
<P>"You did not hurt me, B'Elanna. You could never hurt me." Seven began caress the smaller brown hands within her larger pale ones.</P>
<P>"Your subconscious simply led you to me because it was necessary for your continued well being."</P>
<P>"I didn't hurt you?" B'Elanna could barely take it all in. The only thing that mattered was that she hadn't hurt the beautiful precious woman sitting in front on her, holding her hands tenderly.</P>
<P>"No, you did not hurt me. My only regret is that you were not fully awake to share the experience with me. I could not reciprocate my love to you while you were still unconscious. Do you understand me B'Elanna? Last night you gave me more joy than I thought possible for one person to withstand. You made me complete. You made me a woman."</P>
<P>They stared at each other, both filled with turbulent emotions, unable to speak.</P>

<P>"Janeway to Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>Seven groaned out loud at the interruption.</P>
<P>"Seven here, Captain."</P>
<P>"We're approaching the co-ordinates of the outer region of the temporal currents, Seven. We should be there in another hour, however, Tuvok tells me it would be inadvisable to take Voyager any closer, but a modified shuttle would be in no danger. How about it?"</P>
<P>"A wise precaution, Tuvok is correct. I will work with Lieutenant Torres to make the necessary modifications."</P>
<P>"Good idea. Let me know when you are ready to launch. You can choose your away team. Janeway out."</P>
<P>Seven looked at B'Elanna carefully, she appeared a little shell-shocked, but the haunted, sickened expression had left her eyes. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna there is nothing to worry about. You don't have to say anything. I told you, I am willing to wait forever." She stood and looked down at the engineer, smiling gently.</P>
<P>"I will meet you in the shuttle bay to conduct the modifications." B'Elanna looked up at her without responding.</P>
<P>"Is that acceptable, B'Elanna?" Seven's smile widened at B'Elanna's uncharacteristic silence.</P>
<P>The engineer nodded, still unable to speak. Seven nodded and turned and walked away.</P>
<P>B'Elanna slumped in her chair, her mind couldn't process all the information she had just received. </P>
<P>Just calm down, she told herself. Try and get through the day and speak to Seven when she gets back from the away mission. She'll be gone for a couple of hours and you can compose yourself and behave like an adult and tell her how much she means to you. And this time you can try doing it while you're awake, you pa'taq. She shook her head slightly, bemused at the thought that she had ravished Seven's body in her sleep. She shrugged philosophically; at least she knew what was important in life, Seven and Voyager's engines.</P>

<P>B'Elanna entered the shuttle and glared at Seven's back as she threw herself into the co-pilot's seat.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, you are late." Seven commented as she completed her pre-flight preparations. She knew that the Klingon was annoyed with her and she struggled not to show her amusement.</P>
<P>"You should have left without me, then." B'Elanna knew she was acting like a child, but she didn't really care. She was still pissed off at Seven.</P>
<P>"You presence here is necessary for this mission."</P>
<P>"No it's not." B'Elanna burst out. "The doctor hardly lets me spend any time in engineering as it is, without you getting me assigned to your survey."</P>
<P>B'Elanna had been shocked when the Captain had insisted that she accompany Seven on her mission to observe the temporal planet phasing into existence. She had tried to argue that she was needed in engineering, but the Captain had overruled her, stating that Seven has asked for her to be on this mission. The truth was that she was still nervous about telling Seven her feelings even though she was now sure that they were reciprocated. She had been banking on a little time to sort herself out. But it wasn't to be.</P>

<P>Seven cast her eyes over the sulky engineer and smiled gently.</P>
<P>"Your presence here is necessary to me."</P>
<P>Their gazes locked and B'Elanna dropped hers first. She hardly knew what to do, she certainly didn't know how to respond, so she tinkered with the flight schedule. They were both quiet as the shuttle left Voyager and made its way to the co-ordinates that Seven had programmed.</P>
<P>Seven knew after the incident in the mess hall, the time was right for her to tell B'Elanna how much she loved her, but she found herself strangely shy and decided that if they spent some time together she would find it easier. She hadn't considered that the Klingon would spend the flight sulking. She decided to give her something to do.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, the plasma manifolds are functioning at less than optimum efficiency. Perhaps you could see if any repairs are necessary."</P>
<P>B'Elanna leaned over her console for a minute, punched in a correction and leaned back, with a huff.</P>
<P>"The manifold's fine. I've got nothing to do here."</P>
<P>"Then perhaps you could pretend that you are an explorer and show some interest in the temporal planet." Seven's voice was clearly amused.</P>
<P>"You're being a bully," B'Elanna pouted, not yet ready to forgive Seven for press-ganging her into this mission.</P>
<P>"And you are being a baby," Seven responded as she leaned over the Klingon and gently rubbed B'Elanna's lower lip. "But you are still beautiful." She flashed a rare and beautiful full smile at the stunned Klingon and returned to the helm.</P>
<P>B'Elanna honestly thought that her hearts stopped, both of them, when Seven smiled at her like that.</P>
<P>"Are you coming on to me, Seven?" There was a faint smile playing on B'Elanna lips.</P>
<P>Seven turned to her and raised her ocular implant, imperiously.</P>
<P>"I would have thought that it was clearly evident." The reply was cool, but B'Elanna could see the amusement in those dearly beloved blue eyes.</P>
<P>She rolled hers in exasperation.</P>
<P>"You are so sarcastic, what am I going to do with you?"</P>
<P>"You are going to love me, the way that I love you." Seven stated calmly. She didn't wait for a reply, but turned back to manning the helm.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stared at the profile of the woman she had come to love. There was a lump in her throat and she couldn't speak. Seven's words seemed to expand in the small space and embrace her in a warm blanket of comfort and love. They seemed familiar, constant, as if she had heard them many times before. Seven sounded confident saying them, as if she had said those precious words time and time again. </P>
<P>Even as she screwed up her courage to tell Seven of her feelings, the Borg brought the shuttle to a full stop.</P>
<P>"Seven to Voyager, we have reached to co-ordinates," Seven informed the ship.</P>
<P>"You're sure that you are at a safe distance to collect the readings?" Chakotay's voice came through on the comm.</P>
<P>"Of course, Commander. Stand by for the telemetry readings."</P>
<P>Seven tapped some commands into her console and then reached out her arms for B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Come."</P>
<P>Without hesitation, B'Elanna moved over to the seated Borg and curled up in her lap.</P>
<P>"I wanted you to see this," Seven whispered into B'Elanna's ear as she folded her arms around the Klingon.</P>
<P>Outside the shuttle, the pitch-blackness of the endless night began to shimmer with gossamer threads of incredible rich colour, shattering the darkness and filling it with light and colour. The void seemed to swell and expand, the lights moving faster and faster around the expanding void. Slowly a form began to appear within the void, gradually taking shape, crystal colours, hues of blue, green, purple and white, swirling together to create a wondrous image as the planet formed and became solid and real. </P>
<P>B'Elanna had held her breath throughout the spectacular performance.</P>
<P>"That was so beautiful, Seven. Thank you for bringing me." She tilted her head to stare into the blue eyes.</P>
<P>"It was my pleasure, B'Elanna. I am happy to devote my time to whatever it takes to make you happy."</P>
<P>"I love you, Seven." B'Elanna said the words, her hearts pounding, but saying them felt so right, so sure.</P>
<P>"You take my breath away. Do you know that, Seven?" B'Elanna shifted slightly to stare intently into Seven's face "My love for you grows deeper every day and sometimes I'm so scared that you won't return my love. But I know that you do. I almost feel that I've loved you forever." As she said the words, B'Elanna saw the expression on Seven's face. It was a mixture of joy and sorrow.</P>
<P>"I've loved you before, haven't I?" she asked. "Were we together before I lost my memory? Did we love each other?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded, stroking B'Elanna's ridges tenderly. She was no longer concerned with the past.</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes for a moment, she could feel the pain that Seven must have gone through over the last few months, since her surgery. She leaned up and placed a kiss on Seven's soft lips, her mouth gently exploring, her tongue probing, sucking on the luscious full lower lip. Seven's arms tightened around her and she leaned closer to B'Elanna, trying to fuse their bodies together.</P>
<P>"I can't remember the past, what we felt for each other, all I can feel is right now. My love for you is true and I will spend all of my days trying to make it up to you." </P>

<P>She took Seven's hand and placed it on her chest, the twin hearts pounded out a rhythm. </P>
<P>"Do you feel that, Seven? My hearts are beating for you."</P>
