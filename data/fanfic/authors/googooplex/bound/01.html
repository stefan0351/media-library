<P>"Lieutenant, you are in error. Your research is flawed. You have been distracted by your failed relationship with Lieutenant Paris and as usual, you have failed to give the problem proper consideration. The recalibration of the sensor relay can be accomplished more effectively if you ..."</P>
<P>The two junior engineers working alongside the Head of Astrometrics and their boss looked at each other and by mutual, if unspoken, consent, immediately found somewhere else to be. The clashes between the ex-drone and the half-Klingon were legendary and this was shaping up to be a beauty. They had been bickering for over an hour and it looked like Seven of Nine had finally crossed the line and was about to get her pretty little head knocked off.</P>
<P>B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer of the Federation Starship Voyager, half-Klingon, very pissed off, closed her eyes, ground her teeth, took a deep breath and began counting to ten, very slowly.</P>
<P>Seven of Nine took a small step back from the console she had been working on and turned to observe to smaller woman beside her. She clasped her hands behind her and cocked her head slightly.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, the probability of you understanding my research will increase by 100% if you opened your eyes and looked at the console," her voice was coolly sarcastic.</P>
<P><I>Kahless, God, anyone who's listening, please help me</I>, B'Elanna thought as she gripped the console with grim determination. If she let go she would wrap her fingers around the ex-drone's slender throat and throttle the life out of her.</P>

<P>"Lieutenant Torres, I shall take your lack of response as an acceptance of my superior knowledge in this matter."  Seven started to move away. In her ever so logical mind, Seven knew that her comment would only infuriate the half-Klingon even more, but somehow she couldn't help herself. </P>
<P>"Hold it right there, Seven", B'Elanna finally managed to get her voice to work. She took another very deep breath and held it for a second before releasing it. The engineer considered the beautiful ex-drone before her and made a decision</P>
<P>"We need to talk and we need to do it now".</P>
<P>"Talking is ...," Seven started with her stock reply.</P>
<P>"It is not irrelevant," Torres snapped at her.</P>
<P>"Talking to <I>you</I> is irrelevant", Seven argued back. "Hardly anything is accomplished when we <I>talk</I> because you never listen". There was bitter emphasis from Seven.</P>
<P>That shut B'Elanna up for a second, the remark had hurt. It was also true. The anger and frustration she had with the Borg drained away.</P>
<P>"OK, listen very carefully, Seven. We are going to my office and you are going to listen to me for 10 minutes. Do you understand me?"</P>
<P>"I fail to see the reasons why..." Seven started.</P>
<P>"No, Seven," B'Elanna raised her hand to stop the ex-drone. She kept her voice low and calm. For once she actually felt calm, she felt focused. After months of turbulence in her life, B'Elanna was beginning to get things straightened out and this talk with Seven was a long time coming.</P>
<P>"I'm not debating this with you. I think that it's important that you listen to me right now. If you feel that you can't do that, then, you have no place working in Engineering. Do you understand? This is not negotiable, you come with me now or you leave Engineering for good. The Captain will back me up on this one, Seven," she added confidently. In truth, if Seven did call her bluff and walk away, she wasn't quite sure what would happen.</P>
<P>Though it didn't show on her face, Seven was nonplussed. The Chief Engineer has never been so commanding to her before. She was a good leader and an excellent engineer, there was no doubt about that, but this, this was something altogether different. Seven didn't want to admit it, but she was intrigued. What did the diminutive little woman want?</P>
<P>"While you're thinking about it, I'll get those two goons back", B'Elanna said quietly.</P>
<P>"I will comply", Seven stated calmly when Torres returned with two engineers.</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded and lead the way to her office. Secretly she was relived, but she knew the conversation ahead would be even more difficult.</P>
<P>When they got there, B'Elanna sat behind her desk and Seven stood in her customary pose. </P>
<P>"I'd like you to sit, Seven", she invited.</P>
<P>Seven opened her mouth to say that she preferred to stand, but the half-Klingon was a step ahead.</P>
<P>"Just do it, Seven," a warning note creeping into the still calm voice.</P>
<P>Seven raised her ocular implant slightly, but sat, her hands resting gently on her knees. She looked at the Chief Engineer expectantly.</P>
<P> </P>
<I><P>Think, B'Elanna, think. She may not understand, but you've got to try</I>. B'Elanna gathered her thoughts.</P>
<P>"Seven, what you said out there, about Tom and me, that was completely out of line. You have not right to comment on my personal life, least of all in front of my staff. You need to recognise..." She saw that the Borg was about to speak and forestalled her before she started.</P>
<P>"Uh unh. When I've finished you can respond, but not until then OK?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded, content to wait.</P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her hands together, nervously. She wasn't surprised to find them sweating slightly.</P>
<P>"You need to recognise what is appropriate and what isn't. You question and challenge me and my work all the time." The half-Klingon got up and started pacing the small room. "That's fine when it's just us or during a senior staff meeting, but you do it in front of my staff and that undermines my authority." She took a quick look at Seven and saw the ocular implant rise a notch, and smiled slightly.</P>
<P>"Yes, Seven. I know you think that authority is irrelevant, but I don't think it is and neither does the Captain."  B'Elanna perched on the edge of her desk facing Seven and looked at her. "You are one of the most intelligent people on this ship, you've helped Voyager in so many ways. But you've also made my life a misery more times than I can count and things have got to change. I can't continue to work with you if you don't respect me", she raised her hand again as Seven tried to speak.</P>
<I>
<P>Why would she think that I do not respect her?</P>
</I><P>"I know your antagonism towards me is mostly my fault, I've been a bitch to you for most of the time and I'm sorry." B'Elanna ran her hands through her hair, playing for time. <I>Come on, you wimp, finish it, you've got this far. </I>"Seven, I am truly, truly sorry for the way I've behaved towards you. It was unjustified and unfair and you didn't deserve it." She sighed, forcing herself to keep her gaze as direct as the unreadable blue one aimed at her. B'Elanna wasn't really a tactile person, but she needed to express her sincerity as best as she could. She crouched down beside the seated ex-drone and placed her hands on one of Seven's forearms. </P>
<P>Almost imperceptibly, Seven flinched; she was surprised at the contact, it was what she often expected from the Captain, but not the aggressive Klingon. However, B'Elanna felt the movement and backed away, giving the Borg her personal space.</P>
<I><P>OK, bad idea.</I> B'Elanna thought. "Seven, you are often right about lots of things, like my relationship with Tom, I have been distracted by it. I'm tired of fighting with everyone including you, and I want to try to do better. Would you please let me be a better, more supportive colleague and friend to you?</P>
<P>The pint-sized Klingon swallowed hard and waited. Seven's usually serene brow crinkled slightly.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, you are clearly unwell, should I summon the Doctor?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes in disbelief. <I>You have got to be kidding. She doesn't believe me, she thinks I'm sick.</P>
</I><P>She opened her eyes and looked carefully at the ex-drone. Very fleetingly, she almost missed it; B'Elanna saw the amusement on the face of the woman sitting in front of her.</P>
<P>"Very funny, Seven," she growled, both her hearts were pounding.</P>
<P>"I thought so," said the ever-so-cool Seven.</P>
<P>"Well?" B'Elanna waited for an answer to her apology.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, I am curious, why apologise now?"</P>
<I><P>Great, she's still going to fling my apology back in my face.</I> B'Elanna got up and walked back to her seat, thinking hard. <I>Tell the truth. Tell the truth</I>. She leaned across the desk but realised that her hands were trembling and quickly hid them in her lap. She chewed on her lip for a moment trying to formulate a coherent answer. She was so caught up in her own thoughts that she missed the look of pure bewilderment on the face of Seven.</P>
<I><P>The Lieutenant is clearly unwell despite my attempts at a joke. I have never seen her looking so, so vulnerable.</I> <I>Lieutenant Torres... vulnerable! Yikes.</I> Seven then frowned and made a mental note to stop picking up juvenile and imprecise phrases from Naomi Wildman.</P>
<P>"When my relationship with Tom went so completely wrong, I decided to re-evaluate my relationships with the people that mean a lot to me", B'Elanna started, unaware of the thoughts of her companion.</P>
<P>"I realised that my relationship with the Captain changed when you came aboard and that caused me to react negatively towards you. You see, you replaced me in the Captain's affections. Or at least that's what I felt. Captain Janeway has been my friend, my best friend, and my mentor, in my heart she's been my mother. I love her dearly and it seemed as if you took her love away from me. So I hated you for it. Not for anything else, just because I was jealous".</P>
<P>"And are you still jealous?" She hid it well, but Seven was stunned.</P>
<P>"No, I've come to understand that the Captain loves all of us and that I could have helped her when you came by being your friend and helping you find your humanity. Instead, I sulked and made matters worse. I know that beneath that perfect, ice-cold exterior, you have a heart that beats and that my being the biggest ass this side of the galaxy has made you put up your barriers even higher than before".</P>
<P>Seven had nothing to say to that and stayed silent.</P>
<P>"I have a temper, I know and I tend to be a little aggressive sometimes", she saw the pointed look that came her way at the last comment, but ignored it. "I'm not saying that we'll never fight or have differences of opinion, but I want us to work without the hostility. Can we do that?"</P>
<P>Seven recognised the conciliatory gesture and in her logical mind knew that it must have taken a lot for the proud half-Klingon to open up in such a way, but she did not know how to respond.</P>
<P>"Your proposal is acceptable, but I am uncertain how to proceed. I..., I do not know how?"</P>
<P>"I don't know how to be a good friend to you Seven, but it's because I never took the time to try. She sighed and looked steadily at the bewildered ex-drone. "That's all we have to do, try."</P>

<P>It was the change-over for the alpha and beta shifts and the mess hall was bustling with crewmembers. Tom and B'Elanna sat at a table, talking and joking as they ate their meal. Seven walked into the mess hall and looked round, she knew that Torres was there and wanted to spend some time with her. It had been several months since they had decided to bury the hatchet and they had genuinely become friends. Seven had come to enjoy the times that they spent working together on various projects and she had come to respect and admire the half-Klingon even more than she thought possible. She had a new perspective on how the engineer thought and worked and was constantly amazed at how much effort B'Elanna put in to get the engines running smoothly. Seven had not had the opportunity to see B'Elanna over the past few days, due to work and other commitments and she found that she missed her company. To her shame Seven found that she also missed her fights with the chief engineer. She was at a loss to understand why, but she enjoyed the sensations of watching the Klingon temper bubble over as it frequently did in their past dealings. There was something about the way B'Elanna's eyes darkened to black and how her respiration increased by 6% and her body temperature by 18.75% that fascinated Seven. Or perhaps it was the sound of her twin hearts pounding, then of course there was that ever so subtle, but to Seven, with her acute sense of smell, distinctive and exquisite scent that B'Elanna gave off anytime she lost her rag that made Seven feel, feel exhilarated, alive, something. And she wanted to feel it again but not at the expense of her new relationship with the engineer. She looked round and immediately saw the object of her (desire) thoughts eating with her ex-husband.</P>
<I><P>They looked comfortable together and they made a very handsome couple. Could they be planning reconciliation? B'Elanna should know that Lieutenant Paris is not a fit mate for her. Why would she consider returning to him?</P>
</I><P>The thoughts tumbled through Seven's brain for a second before logic kicked in. Tom and B'Elanna acknowledged their mistakes and returned to their easy friendship of old. Sharing a meal did not constitute a romantic reconciliation. <I>Even if it did, why should that bother you?</I> Seven decided to ignore the question that popped into her head and retrieve a tray of nutritional supplements.</P>
<P>Just as she was about to make her way over to her friends the Captain strolled in and beckoned to Seven to join her.</P>
<I><P>Rats</I>. Seven thought as she changed direction and joined Janeway. She then frowned and made a mental note to stop picking up juvenile terms from Tom Paris.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"So, how's your new best friend working out? Fucked her yet?" Tom asked the question casually as her chewed on his meal. He grinned at the extremely evil glare that his ex-wife aimed at him and patted her back politely as she got over her choking fit.</P>
<P>"You are a crude and nasty bastard, Tom," B'Elanna croaked out. "Why the sam hill would you ask such a question?"</P>
<P>"Oh, come on Lanna, we both know what your libido's like and Seven's probably one of the few people on the ship that could actually handle you when you get that old bloodlust thing." Tom leaned back in his seat and smiled knowingly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked down at her plate pensively. "I wasn't always like that, I was gentle as well."</P>
<P>Tom quickly leaned forward and stoked her hand. "Hey, come on, I'm only kidding, you were always gentle with me," he smiled self-deprecatingly, " I guess that why you fought so much with Seven, you had to get rid of some of that energy somehow."</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked. That actually made some sense.</P>
<P>"So since you guys aren't fighting anymore, I figured that you must be fingering each other."</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes at Tom's crudity. Then snapped them open again and pinned him with her stare.</P>
<P>"Are you having me on?" she was perplexed at the conversation. </P>
<P>"Well, not really," he replied, his mouth full. "Why? it's not against regulations or anything."</P>
<P>B'Elanna could feel herself starting to blush and kept her eyes fixed on her plate.</P>
<P>"But she's a girl."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Darling, I noticed."</P>
<P>"I've never been with a woman before, I've never even considered it an option."</P>
<P>"Well, it's a thought. You know what you're like, you won't use the holodeck, you won't have casual sex, you need a long-term partner. It's either that or learning Vulcan meditation. I know which option I'd choose."</P>
<P>"Yeah, fine but why Seven, why a girl?"</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, when you decided to end the feud with Seven, there was a massive sweepstakes to see how long it would last. You are the most impatient, impulsive, quick-tempered, mercurial person I know. Not one single person thought that you would be able to tolerate Seven, who we know to be an arrogant, condescending, difficult and perfect little drone. But you did it, six, seven months later you guys are still good friends, to everyone's surprise. You sing her praises, you support her, you help her out and she does the same for you. If you can be such a good friend, why not lover?"</P>
<P>"She isn't any of those things, not really, you've just got to get to know her, that's all," B'Elanna muttered. She was still blushing and staring at the table.</P>
<P>"Well, you've obviously got to know her, you care about her. The emotions are already there."</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked up to make sure that no one could overhear their conversation, as she did, she saw Seven talking to the Captain. Strangely, at that very moment Seven turned to look right back at her. Neither smiled, a mere nod of the head from Seven, B'Elanna dropped her eyes and blushed like it was going out of fashion.</P>
<P>"I hate you, Tom, how am I going to be able to look her in the eye after this?" she wailed. A thought occurred to her. " Would you ever consider, you know, doing it with another man?"</P>
<P>Tom dropped his fork and paled slightly at the question. "No way."</P>
<P>"Why is it ok for me to be with another woman, but you wouldn't consider a man? What's wrong with Harry?"</P>
<P>Tom paled some more. "Please don't put that image in my head, Harry's a friend." He recovered somewhat. "Anyway, I've got all the pussy I can handle right here," he grinned and gestured to the busy mess hall.</P>
<P>B'Elanna frowned. "I wish you wouldn't be so crude."</P>
<P>Tom leaned forward and picked up her hand, "B'Elanna, I'm not as discriminating as you, you don't do things in half measures, you need someone who's in it for the long haul, I wasn't. Seriously, Seven might be the one for you. And when you do finally get it on, please let me watch."</P>
<P>Several heads turned as Tom yelped in pain at the extremely hard knock he received in the chest courtesy of the chief engineer.</P>
<P>The Captain smiled indulgently at the antics of B'Elanna and Tom. "I'm glad that those two sorted out their differences," she commented as she chewed on her chicken salad.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven was thinking, why had B'Elanna blushed when their eyes met a few moments ago?</P>
<P>"Talking of settling differences, I must commend you for the way in which both you and B'Elanna have worked things out. I would have given you both commendations but Tuvok overruled me on that one." Kathryn grinned.</P>
<P>"To be honest, Captain, your praise should go to B'Elanna. It was she who made all the attempts to cease hostilities between us. She apologised for her previous behaviour and explained her reasons for it. I would not have known how to resolve our difficulties if she had not done so herself." Seven had been sworn to secrecy over the talk they had all those months ago, but she was pleased to be able to let the Captain know how much B'Elanna had changed.</P>
<P>"Well, whoever, was responsible, you both have displayed great maturity and courage and I'm proud of you both."</P>
<P>Seven looked earnestly at the Captain, " It would mean a lot to B'Elanna if you told her that. Your approval means everything to her, you are..." recalling the only half-jesting threat of broken legs and grievous bodily damage, Seven reigned herself in.</P>
<P>"I believe it would be beneficial to her well-being," she continued, more formally.</P>
<P>Kathryn eyed the beautiful young woman in front of her and wondered what she had been about to say. She had never really acknowledged it to herself, but Seven and the prickly, hostile little engineer were like the daughters she never had. It had hurt her that they never seemed to bury their differences except in times of trouble and crises and now that they had actually become friends, it made her heart overflow. But as Captain she couldn't really show those kinds of emotions.</P>
<P>"I'll keep that in mind," she smiled.</P>

</table>

<P>It was a few days after her chat with Tom about taking Seven as a partner and B'Elanna had finally stopped blushing. She was off-duty in her quarters relaxing. Apart from work and the occasional staff meeting, she hadn't had to opportunity to speak to Seven at all. To tell the truth, she'd been avoiding her. Each time B'Elanna thought about visiting the ex-drone or inviting her to her quarters to share a meal or just to talk, unbidden images sprang to mind. Images that made her hearts pound painfully and made her body ache.</P>
<I><P>Get a grip and get over yourself. What makes you think that Seven would even be interested in you anyway?</I>  B'Elanna looked around the quarters they were fit for company, and anyway she didn't need to stand on ceremony with Seven.</P>
<P>She tapped her combadge.</P>
<P>"Torres to Seven of Nine"</P>
<P>"Go ahead, Lieutenant," came the crisp response.</P>
<P>"I've not seen you in days, why don't you come over when your shift ends, I could replicate something and we could chill out for a while," B'Elanna invited. Strangely, she felt a little nervous even though Seven had spent lots of time in her quarters.</P>
<P>"I am no longer on duty and your invitation is acceptable, I will join you shortly. Seven out."</P>
<I><P>That wasn't so hard now, was it?</I> B'Elanna was still nervous and she knew the reason why.</P>
<P>She was setting the table and her hands were full when the doorbell went (you know what I mean). </P>
<P>"Seven, you know the code," B'Elanna called out. She had given Seven the code months back so that she could have a place to relax when she wasn't on duty.</P>
<P>The door opened and Seven walked in, she hovered in the doorway for a split second and then came all the way in.</P>
<P>"Hi" B'Elanna looked over at her friend who smiled slightly and started to help with the dishes.</P>
<P>Seven was quiet as she placed the crockery in precisely the right places. <I>B'Elanna is relaxed and casual, the way that she usually is with me but she is nervous. Her heart rate and temperature are elevated</I>. She took a quick look as the Klingon unloaded the replicator. She was out of uniform wearing her favourite denim trousers. They were very old and faded and had shrunk because B'Elanna had insisted in washing them in the most inefficient manner possible. By hand and in water. The side effect was that the denim clung to every curve of the Lieutenant's shapely body. As usual, when she was relaxing, B'Elanna was barefoot and had neglected to fasten the top button of her jeans. She wore a short white sleeveless top and each time she stretched, her toned, coffee - coloured abdomen was exposed. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seven's throat was dry. The emotions she experienced when she pissed B'Elanna off were washing over her in gentle waves. They were most distracting.</P>
<P>B'Elanna tapped her gently on the shoulder.</P>
<P>"Hey, why so quiet, food's ready."</P>
<P>Seven forced herself to concentrate and looked over the meal that her friend had prepared. It was a West African dish of jollof rice and fried plantain, chicken and steamed vegetables. </P>
<P>She looked up, surprised.</P>
<P>"This is one of my favourite meals, thank you."</P>
<P>"Well you've not been over for a while..."</P>
<P>"12 days exactly," Seven interjected.</P>
<P>"Exactly, so why not?"</P>
<P>The two women ate and B'Elanna talked about her day, but her mind was on something else. She knew that she was in a heightened state of arousal but didn't know what to do about it. Her acute Klingon senses had picked up the clean, fresh and sweet smell of Seven's skin the minute she walked in, but B'Elanna was used to that. What she wasn't used to was the desire she now had to taste that skin. A desire that was getting stronger by the minute.</P>
<P>Seven had already noted that B'Elanna's eyes were now completely black and that her pupils had dilated.</P>
<P>She put down her cutlery, "B'Elanna I need to ask you something," she stated.</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked a few times to clear the image of her sucking on Seven's lucious skin, that place where her shoulder meets her neck and paid attention.</P>
<P>"Shoot"</P>
<P>"Why have you been avoiding me? Have I done something to offend you?"</P>
<P>"Shit." B'Elanna closed her eyes for a beat, "Sorry, didn't mean to swear."</P>
<P>The thought of lying didn't even cross her mind. "Seven you've done nothing to offend me, I've had something on my mind and it's been distracting that's all." </P>
<P>Idly, B'Elanna wondered if her reply would satisfy Seven. Her filthy mind then suggested several other ways of satisfying Seven.</P>
<P>"If you had a problem, perhaps it would help to share it with me. I may be able to help ease your discomfort." Seven said the words in all sincerity and, it should be noted, all innocence.</P>
<P>B'Elanna gulped. <I>Does she know what she's doing to me? </I>The thought of Seven easing her discomfort made her tremble.</P>
<P> She put her fork down before she dropped it and used her napkin to dab her brow. She wasn't surprised to find that she was sweating.</P>
<I><P>Get a grip and stop acting like a randy teenager.</I> She said to herself sternly.</P>
<P>"Seven, it's nothing serious, honestly," she bluffed. Any minute now she was going to start blushing and that would open a whole new can of worms.</P>
<P>"Does it have anything to do with the conversation you had with Tom Paris 3 days ago?"</P>
<P>"Shit. Shit."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her curiously, "I have often noted that you normally resort to profanity when you have been caught out in a deception of some sort. Is that the case now?"  She raised her ocular implant imperiously.</P>
<P>"Have you been deceiving me in some way B'Elanna Torres?"</P>
<P>"Fucking hell, Seven." She said the words calmly enough but she knew that she had to give a pretty thorough explanation in order that she didn't loose Seven's trust. She also knew that she was blushing like there was no tomorrow.</P>
<P>"You are blushing, your pupils are dilated, your heart rate is highly elevated and your breathing is rapid." Seven noted dispassionately.</P>
<P>"Oh Kahless," B'Elanna moaned out loud.</P>
<P>"Do you wish to..." Seven started</P>
<P>"Don't say it Seven," B'Elanna interrupted her before things got completely out of hand. She took a deep breath and started.</P>
<P>"This is the thing," she looked over at the ever-loveable Borg and got lost in her gorgeous blue (I swear they're grey) eyes.</P>
<P>"The thing is? " Seven prompted.</P>
<P>"Yeah, right, the thing is that Tom, that motherfucker Tom Paris, made some suggestions to me erm, er, about you, that kinda made me a little jittery that's all. Honest." <I>Please Kahless, please don't let her ask what kind of suggestions</I>.</P>
<P>"What kind of suggestions?"</P>
<I><P>Thanks for nothing.</I> B'Elanna swallowed hard, time to bite the bullet. <I>What's the worse that could happen? Seven will be amused or she'll break Tom's neck. Either way she doesn't get to know about me lusting after her and I get let off the hook. It's a win - win situation.</P>
</I>
<P>"OK, I don't want you to be upset. But it was about us become lovers as well as friends."</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked over at her friend carefully; Seven was watching her like a hawk but had made no comment.</P>
<P>"Seven," B'Elanna croaked fearfully.</P>
<P>"Acceptable."</P>
<P>"What!" B'Elanna couldn't help it; she jumped out of her seat, sending the chair crashing over.</P>
<P>"Wha.., what do you mean, <I>Acceptable</I>. Are you nuts?" Her voice raised to a near shout and she was hopping from one foot to the other, unable to keep still. </P>
<P>"Do you know what you're saying? Did you hear what I said?"</P>
<P>The conversation was going wrong on so many levels. B'Elanna's heart were pounding so hard, she felt sure they were going to burst out of her chest. She was thrilled and terrified at the same time and to make matters worse, Seven had got out of her seat and was following her about the room, almost stalking her.</P>
<P>"I find the suggestion of us being mates acceptable. As you have pointed out we have become good friends, we share many common interests and we are both sexually attracted to one another. We are a natural choice."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about, we are not a natural choice, we're both women," B'Elanna almost shouted at the blond.</P>
<P>Seven merely raised her ocular implant.</P>
<P>"And, and what do you mean, we are both sexually attracted to each other?" The minute the question was out, B'Elanna  knew she should have left that one well alone.</P>
<P>"I had noted that often, during your abortive marriage to Tom Paris you were frequently sexually frustrated. You relived these frustrations by fighting with me. All the symptoms that you have been experiencing since I entered the room are evident each time we meet or argue. I know that you desire me.</P>
<P>I also know that my body aches for you and your touch. My stomach drops as soon as I hear your voice , it hurts when you are not there but I can not concentrate when you are near me, like now."</P>
<P>B'Elanna was mesmerised and didn't notice how close Seven had got.</P>
<P>Seven lifted a strand of B'Elanna's hair and let it run through her fingers. "The scent of your skin is intoxicating I want to taste it, I want to touch you, all of you." B'Elanna had stopped breathing and couldn't even begin to start thinking, so she looked up into Seven's eyes. Big mistake. The pupils had taken up most of the blue iris; her eyes were almost black with desire.</P>
<P>Seven took up B'Elanna's hand and placed on her chest, just above her bosom. </P>
<P>"Can you feel my heart, can you feel it Lanna?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded dumbly, it felt like a drum pounding, faster and faster. Seven lowered her head, her mouth mere fractions away from the uncharacteristically silent half-Klingon.</P>
<P>"My heart is beating for you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her lips and inadvertently flicked at Seven's upper lip with the tip of her tongue. She wasn't prepared for the jolt of desire that crashed though her at the tiniest of contact. She was even more shocked at the moan that came from Seven. She nearly came at the sound, but it brought her to her senses.</P>
<P>She took a step back from Seven and broke the contact. She gestured to the sofa.</P>
<P>"Seven, please sit, we need to talk."</P>
<P>Seven wanted to argue, she wanted to continue her closeness with the Lieutenant, but she bided her time. For now.</P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her ridges and closed her eyes. <I>How in the name of all that is holy, did I get myself into this mess?</P>
</I>
<P>"Seven, I won't try to deny it. I am attracted to you, on lots of different levels. I mean your brain is remarkable, you're loyal, and you want the best for Voyager. You're beautiful...." she looked at the ex-drone and got lost again, "God, you are so beautiful." She shook her head to bring her back to the present. She sat down beside Seven and picked up her Borg-enhanced hand. B'Elanna traced the implants along the slender, pale hand, not trusting herself to look into those eyes again.</P>
<P>"You are still very much a child when it comes to emotions and sexuality. I have never, ever considered being with a woman, despite my feelings for you and I'm not honestly sure that I could. It's wouldn't be right for me to take you, take your body without considering what it might mean for both of us. I'd be taking advantage of you," she risked a look at the silent woman. "Do you understand me, can you understand me?" B'Elanna knew that she was almost pleading.</P>
<P>Seven snatched her hand away and got to her feet.</P>
<P>"You are rejecting me." she stated baldly. </P>
<P>B'Elanna jumped up after her and gripped Seven by her hands.</P>
<P>"No. no, Seven. Please don't think that. Please don't think that I could ever do that to you. It's just that, it's, I'm ..." She dropped Seven's hands and rubbed her ridges in confusion.</P>
<P>"Seven, I don't know what to do. This is too new for both of us. We can't rush. I can not rush you. It wouldn't be fair. Please sit."</P>
<I><P>She has not rejected me. She has not rejected me.</I> Those were the only thoughts in Seven's head.</P>
<P>She turned her crystal blue gaze on B'Elanna. "What do you propose?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna slumped back down on the sofa and watched while Seven sat beside her.</P>
<P>"I don't know what I want," B'Elanna felt close to tears.</P>
<P>"You want me." Simple statement of fact from the former Borg.</P>
<P>"It's not as simply as that Seven. The truth is that I do want you, I want you so badly, I can't rest, I can't work, I can't think. But I don't know if I can take that step. I don't know if I want to." She covered her face in her hands.</P>
<I><P>B'Elanna is hurting. You must help her, ease her pain.</I> Seven moved over and clasped the diminutive woman in her arms and rocked her gently. She was shocked to find that B'Elanna was trembling.</P>
<P>"If you require time to consider whether you want to be with me, I am willing to wait."  She placed a gentle kiss in the cloud of dark hair and whispered softly, "I am willing to wait forever."</P>

<P>Janeway was in her ready room with Chakotay going over the duty roster and other ship's business.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna's made a request that Icheb be given more responsibility in engineering, she wants him to have a higher access level."</P>
<P>"As long as he's properly supervised, he's too young to be given major projects," she took a sip of her coffee. "Ouch, hot. And make sure Seven's OK about it, I don't want to find that B'Elanna's press-ganged him into it. Given the chance, she'll recruit everyone to Engineering," </P>
<P>"Except, Neelix," Chakotay added. They both grinned at the thought of the sometimes sullen almost always angry engineer having to deal with the perpetually happy morale officer. </P>
<P>"Anyway, I'm pretty certain B'Elanna's cleared it with Seven already. You must have noticed how well they're getting along these days."</P>
<P>"I just hope it lasts," the Captain was thoughtful. </P>
<P>"It will, I'm sure of it, Seven is a lot more committed than Tom," </P>
<P>Janeway looked up from the data padd she was reading from, "Tom? What has Tom got to do with ..." Realisation dawned. "B'Elanna and Seven? Are you sure?"</P>
<P>At this point Chakotay clued into the fact that the Captain hadn't picked up on the vibes coming from the two women.</P>
<P>"To be honest, Kathryn, I think they are just beginning to realise the attraction they have for each other. Please don't say anything."</P>
<P>Kathryn looked up at him. "You know I wouldn't."</P>
<P>"I know you've always had a soft spot for Seven, you might want to encourage her or warn her about broken hearts or something."</P>
<P>She quirked her mouth in acknowledgement, he was right.</P>
<P>"Darn it, how am I going to be able to just sit and watch?"</P>
<P>"Well this may take your mind off those two," he handed her a stack of padds.</P>
<P>"What's all this?"</P>
<P>"These requisition orders from almost every department. We still haven't fully recovered from our skirmish with the Xenons and in case you haven't noticed the ship is falling apart."</P>
<P>Kathryn gave him a mock-filthy glare, along with Tuvok, he was one of the few people on Voyager who could take liberties.</P>
<P>"I know, what we need is a nice M - class planet, with a technologically advanced and friendly race willing to trade and a nice relaxing climate for the crew to get some RNR."</P>
<P>"Funny you should mention that," he grinned as he handed her yet another padd</P>
<P>"Seven's located a nice M-class planet on long-range sensors. It's about 30 light years away and it's in the wrong direction ..."</P>
<P>"But considering the state of play with the ship a detour may be advisable," she finished his sentence. "Have Tom slow to impulse and get Seven and Harry to see what they can find out about this planet."</P>
<P>"Aye, Captain."</P>

<hr>

<P>"Another conduit relay has just blown out, Lieutenant," Vorik calmly informed the chief engineer. He watched her close her eyes and grip the console she was working on. He wondered if she would explode or whether she would allow the Vulcan mantra he knew she'd been working on to calm her down. He soon had his answer.</P>
<P>"Fuck this all to grethor and back," she slammed her fist down on the console causing it to spark, blink and then go out. Vorik blinked, he hadn't heard that one before. He stood back, hands clasped behind him, impassive as another stream of obscenities poured forth. </P>
<P>B'Elanna ran out of breath and looked over at the quiet Vulcan. "I'm sorry about that, Vorik."</P>
<P>"Your apology is accepted, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>She sighed and rubbed her ridges, it had been a long day, she had been working for 10 hours straight and things were going from bad to worse. She grabbed a toolkit.</P>
<P>"You  know, Vorik, if we don't get some dilithium and soon, the warp core is going conk out and we'll have to get out and push."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Lieutenant." Vorik knew from old that pointing out the lack of logic in her statements rarely went down well.</P>
<P>"You and Carey take the three blown relays on this deck, I'll take the one on deck 8. Once you've sorted them out, both of you go off duty. You've been working for too long."</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, may I point out that you have been on duty for approximately 4.5 hours longer than any of us. It would be logical for you also to rest."</P>
<P>She patted his arm as she walked away, " Didn't you know, Vorik? No rest for the wicked."</P>
<P>She crawled in the Jeffries Tube and located the defective relay. Not only had it blown out, it had also fused with several other components. It was going to take the better part of an hour to sort out the mess. She was meant to meet Seven when she got off duty. That was about 4 hours ago. She didn't want to cancel their date? (is that what is was?) so she kept on postponing, but this was ridiculous. She tapped her combadge.</P>
<P>"Torres to Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>"Seven, here." </P>
<P>"Seven, I can't make it tonight. I'm stuck in a Jeffries Tube and I'm going to be here for ages. I know you're already late for your regeneration cycle, I don't want to keep you waiting anymore. Go to bed. I'll see you tomorrow."</P>
<P>"I am disappointed that we will not meet, but please remember what I told you. I am prepared to wait." Seven was alluding to the conversation they'd had a week ago. They had not come to any resolution other than to acknowledge the burgeoning feelings they had for each other.</P>
<P>"I promise I'll see you soon, OK?"</P>
<P>"Acceptable."</P>
<P>"Goodnight, Seven."</P>
<P>"Goodnight, B'Elanna."</P>
<P>Seven looked at the sensor data she had been analysing. Suddenly it didn't seem very interesting any more. She knew that the emotion she was feeling was disappointment, but wasn't sure what to do with it. She knew that she was too restless to regenerate now, and since she was due for a medical check up, she decided to see the doctor.</P>
<P>"Seven, to what do I owe the pleasure?"</P>
<P>The doctor was inappropriately cheerful, Seven thought, especially in light of her recent disappointment.</P>
<P>"You requested that I attend my medical check up, Doctor."</P>
<P>"That was 6 days ago, Seven, but better late than never. Hop up on that biobed and we'll get started."</P>
<P>"I would prefer to stand." Seven looked at the Doctor as he began bustling about.</P>
<P>"Whatever."</P>
<P>30 minutes later...</P>
<P>Seven was exasperated with the doctor. He had spent an inordinate amount of time prodding, poking and testing and she was at the end of her tether.</P>
<P>"Doctor, these tests are an inefficient use of our time, we should ..."</P>
<P>"I beg to differ, Seven. These test have given me invaluable updates on how your system is functioning. And I've some very good news for you. These result show that your dependency on the alcove is gradually becoming less. If we increase your nutritional supplements and start you on sleeping regimen, we can wean you off it for good. Isn't that wonderful news?" the Doctor beamed expansively at Seven.</P>
<P>Seven is less than happy. "I find that eating is an inefficient use of my time and resources. In addition, I do not know how to sleep. I prefer to continue the use of my alcove."</P>
<P>The Doctor frowned at her. "You don't need your alcove anymore, not really. You don't need to be chained to it, don't you see?"</P>
<P>Seven blinked in uncharacteristic uncertainty. Understanding dawned on the Doctor. He put a familiar arm around the ex-drone and waved his other arm about.</P>
<P>"You're just a little frightened that's all, Seven." </P>
<P>"The Borg do not get frightened," she retorted.</P>
<P>"Ah, but that's just it, You are no longer Borg. Not really. You're more human than Borg and you need to adapt. This is just another stage in your continuing development, Seven."</P>
<P>She tilted her head slightly, " Explain."</P>
<P>"Well, most people are afraid of change, or at least wary of it. You know, the fear of the unknown. People prefer and understand what they are used to. Change brings uncertainty, people don't usually change things about themselves simply for the sake of it. It's quite natural to cling to the old and the familiar. And you know that old chestnut ' Better the devil you know ...' Having said that, change is a necessary part of every-ones development."</P>
<P>"Your monologue would indicate that change is a good thing?" Seven's brain was racing. She knew that the topic that the doctor was prattling on about had direct relevance to her and B'Elanna, could it be that the half-Klingon was simply scared of the unknown?"</P>
<P>The Doctor rolled his eyes but answered</P>
<P>"Yes, usually, change is a good thing."</P>
<P>"How can, what you term, the fear of the unknown, be eliminated?"</P>
<P>"Well in your case, Seven, I will recommend to the Captain that you get your own quarters and I'll set up a rota of how long you should regenerate interspersed with periods of sleep and good healthy eating."</P>
<P>"No, I meant..." Seven stopped for moment, unused to prevarication. "I mean in other circumstances."</P>
<P>"Well I suppose one way to embrace change is to try new experiences, see how much you like them. That could bring about change. Now about your meals..."</P>
<P>Seven had switched off, she was thinking hard. <I>I need to introduce new experiences to B'Elanna. She needs to see that taking me as a mate would be good for her personal development.</I></P>

<P>It had taken nearly two hours to repair the damage in the Jeffries Tube and B'Elanna was deadly tired. She needed a shower, food and bed and she was seriously considering skipping the first two and going straight to bed. She was really pissed off about missing her evening with Seven and was toying with idea of paying a quick visit to Cargobay Two. If Seven was regenerating, then she could leave her a poem or a dirty limerick or something. The thought of seeing Seven, even if only for a few minutes washed away the tiredness and she quickly started to make her way the cargobay. Halfway there, she bumped into Tom and Harry coming out the holodeck. They were dressed in 20<SUP>th</SUP> century gangster suits, they clearly been having a good time.</P>
<P>"Hey, B'Elanna, my sweet, my favourite ex-wife, how are you?" Tom called out a little too loudly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna leaned against the wall and folded her arms, "Tom, you idiot, you're drunk." </P>
<P>She looked over at a sheepish looking Harry Kim, " You let him drink, Harry?"</P>
<P>Harry grinned and shrugged his shoulders, "We're on our way to sickbay now and he's not on duty for another 6 hours. Everything's under control."</P>
<P>Just as he said that Tom stumbled and nearly fell, B'Elanna caught him just in time and tried to prop him up against the wall.</P>
<P>Tom had other ideas and draped his arms around her shoulders and planted a huge sloppy kiss on the surprised mouth of his ex-wife.</P>
<P>"You know, Lanna, we don't dance anymore, whyish that?" he slurred. </P>
<P>B'Elanna giggled. " Tom you are an absolute dolt, we never danced. Now get off me, you big lug."</P>
<P>In the ensuing struggle to get Tom fully upright and walking in the right direction, none of the three noticed Seven observing the scene. She had arrived when Tom had his arms around B'Elanna and watched in fury as he kissed her. She turned on her heel and stormed away, not fully understanding what she had just seen other than that B'Elanna had been in the arms of her ex-lover. </P>
<P>By the time she and Harry had got Tom to the Doctor, B'Elanna could barely see straight she was that tired. She went to bed promising herself that she would see Seven the following day even if it killed her.</P>
<P>The next day just after her shift ended B'Elanna was reading some reports in her quarters. She planned to surprise Seven with a long walk on the holodeck in a few hours.</P>
<P>She looked up in surprise as Seven strode into her quarters. Something was clearly upsetting the woman.</P>
<P>"Seven, what's wrong? Has anything happened?" Her concern was evident, but Seven was so caught up in her fury that she didn't notice.</P>
<P>"You are prepared to spend time with Paris, laughing and joking with him," Seven bit out. Her implacable blue gaze was ice-cold. "You touched him, you... you kissed him." The ex-drone was furious and showing it. B'Elanna couldn't get a word in edgewise.</P>
<P>"Seven, he was ..."</P>
<P>"Do not attempt to deny it, B'Elanna Torres, you are still in love with him." Seven accused. She actually felt as if her cardiac muscle was going to cease to function. She was hurting, badly.</P>
<P>"Seven, calm down and listen to me. You are just feeling a little insecure, that's all." </P>
<P>B'Elanna put down the reports that she had been reading and walked over to the statuesque woman. </P>
<P>"I never would have expected it, but I guess you're just a little jealous that's all." She ran her thumb over Seven's full lower lip.</P>
<P>Seven, however, was having none of it. She shoved the smaller woman away from her.</P>
<P>"Do not attempt to distract me. Do you still love Lieutenant Paris?"</P>
<P>"Seven, of course I do, I was married to him, he's been a friend for over six years ..."</P>
<P>She didn't get a chance to explain that she loved him but was no longer <B>in love</B> with him.</P>
<P>"You have been deceiving me all these months ..."</P>
<P>"Seven, stop..."</P>
<P>"You do not care for me, was this some form of punishment?"</P>
<P>"Seven. Stop it. Right now." B'Elanna was beginning to get annoyed herself.</P>
<P>"Why? Why should I trust you or believe you? You have given me no promises, no assurances. You are willing to kiss that, that insignificant little man in full view of every one but you resist even holding my hand in public."</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes, it was true.</P>
<P>"Despite my promise that I would wait, you have made no attempt to resolve your aversion to me."</P>
<P>"Seven, will you stop and listen for one goddamned minute," The Klingon temper could only be held at bay for so long.</P>
<P>"It has only been a few weeks since we discovered what we felt for each other. We agreed to wait for your sake as well as mine." B'Elanna stalked around her quarters, she was good and angry herself now.</P>
<P>"Look at you, you're still a virgin for christsakes. You have absolutely no experience of sex or sexuality or anything. You don't know what you want right now."</P>
<P>Seven grabbed B'Elanna by the shoulders roughly and pulled her up close.</P>
<P>"I know that I want you and you are denying me. You are denying both of us. I never thought that you could be such a coward."</P>
<P>That really stung. B'Elanna pulled herself away.</P>
<P>"Is that what this is about, Seven?  You have an itch that needs scratching? You wanna fuck right now then? B'Elanna was so angry that she couldn't help herself. </P>
<P>Neither could Seven. Her Borg enhanced hand shot out and back-handed B'Elanna across the face. The force lifted the engineer clear across the room. There was a stunned silence from both of them.</P>
<P>Seven had a look of pure horror on her face at what she had done, but she was rooted to floor at the look of unbridled fury on the face of B'Elanna as she stumbled to her feet.</P>
<P>"I'm ... I'm so sorry. I..." Seven couldn't get the words out right. They sounded lame and stupid. In the recesses of her mind, she noted that the fury seemed to drain away from B'Elanna, but that fact didn't help any.</P>
<P>"Seven, I think you should leave." The words sounded muffled, but they were quite calm. Too calm.</P>
<P>Tears rushed to her eyes and Seven made no attempt to hide them. "Please let me help you."</P>
<P>"No, Seven, I want you to leave now." B'Elanna looked up at the stricken ex-drone, her blue eyes brimming with unshed tears and just wanted to go into her arms, but she didn't.</P>
<P>"We'll talk tomorrow, but for now, I just want you to go."</P>
<P>Seven nodded miserably and left, her head bowed.</P>
<P>As the doors closed, B'Elanna crumpled to the floor. She was too upset to cry. Of all the fights that she'd had with Seven, or anyone else for that matter, this was by far the worse. She wondered if that crashing noise was the sound of her twin hearts shattering.</P>

<P>Seven returned to her alcove and sat on the floor in a corner and began to cry. She cried her heart out. She had her knees up against her chest and rocked herself as she sobbed.</P>
<P>She didn't hear the cargobay doors open or notice that she was no longer alone until she felt a hand shaking her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Seven, are you alright?" Naomi had never seen the resident borg so distressed before and it frightened her. </P>
<P>"Should I call the doctor, or... or the Captain? Maybe my mum could help?"</P>
<P>Seven could not stop the tears streaming down her face as she looked at the child.</P>
<P>"Naomi Wildman, I do not require assistance at this time. Please leave." The crying fit was over but she was exhausted and rested her forehead on her knees.</P>
<P>Naomi thought for a second and then came to a decision. She sat down, next to her friend and gently rubbed her should in sympathy.</P>
<P>Seven didn't lift her head but felt the intended comfort from the child. </P>
<P>"Naomi Wildman, state your intention." Her voice was muffled and the sound of her tears could clearly be heard.</P>
<P>"Well it always helps me to talk to someone when I'm upset or angry. So maybe, you could talk to me." Naomi looked at her bowed head curiously, "Why are you so sad?"</P>
<P>"I did something horrible to someone I call a friend," she confessed</P>
<P>"When I make my Mum angry or upset, it usually helps to say how sorry I am for being naughty. You could tell your friend that you are sorry." </P>
<P>"Mere words are not enough. There are no words..." Seven trailed off, overwhelmed at the emotional rollercoaster she was going through.</P>
<P>"Well you could make a present, or write a poem or draw a picture or replicate their favourite meal or do something really nice for them. That helps as well," Naomi nodded knowledgeably. </P>
<P>Seven looked up, "Completing any or all of these tasks will demonstrate my regret?"</P>
<P>"Sure, but make sure you say sorry real soon. Like today or tomorrow."</P>
<P>"Explain"</P>
<P>Naomi crinkled her ridge forehead, "I don't quite know but both Neelix and my mum seem to think that it's real important."</P>
<P>Seven sat up straight and wiped the moisture from her eyes. She had a plan of action to try and make things right.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Naomi Wildman, your advice has been most informative." It was a day for doing things out of character. Seven leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on the forehead of the child. "Thank you, Naomi," she whispered softly.</P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna was working in engineer a few hours later, she had been to the doctor and had her broken jaw reset and come up with a suitable lie to get him off her back. She couldn't sleep or eat so she decided to work. At least working could cure all her ills.</P>
<P>She was aware the minute Seven walked into engineer, her senses could pick up the woman's scent at 50 paces. B'Elanna didn't look up from her console as Seven approached and only acknowledged her when she spoke softly.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, may I have a moment of your time?"</P>
<P>"Of course, Seven, what can I do for you?" She was calm and very polite. But Seven's heart sank as she looked into those deep-brown velvet eyes. Gone was the usual warmth and laughter and friendship that she was used to, now they looked completely unreadable. Seven had no idea what B'Elanna was thinking or feeling.</P>
<P>She clasped her hands behind her back to stop them from shaking.</P>
<P>"I know that you said that we would talk tomorrow, but I would be grateful if we could talk today."</P>
<P>B'Elanna crossed her arms and raised her eyebrows, she should have known that Seven wouldn't wait.</P>
<P>"When do you suggest?"</P>
<P>"Now, but somewhere private," Seven sounded calm but inside she was shaking like jelly.</P>
<P>"OK, I'll been done here soon, Why don't you go to my quarters, I'll be there in say 20 minutes?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded in relief and walked quickly away before B'Elanna could change her mind.</P>
<P>She waited nervously in B'Elanna's quarters and for the hundredth time wondered if the gifts she had made were inadequate. She knew that B'Elanna would never tolerate anyone touching her engines without her permission, so she decided against completing a one-woman overhaul. She also knew that the half-Klingon had a sturdy constitution and would eat almost anything put in front of her, so Seven decided to be creative. She had made a miniature replica of Voyagers engines made out of rare Zambesi gold, she had to trade 4 months of holodeck privileges with a junior crewman to obtain the gold. She had also hand-carved a tritanium Met'leth to add to B'Elanna's small collection of Klingon weapons. Finally she had unearthed an old earth song that seemed appropriate. </P>
<P>B'Elanna walked into the lounge and unzipped her jacket. She looked at seven without say a word and went over to the replicator.</P>
<P>"Do you want anything to eat or drink, Seven?" she asked politely.</P>
<P>Seven shook her head, her tongue had glued itself to the roof of her mouth. The words of apology and regret that she had carefully prepared dried up in her throat.</P>
<P>B'Elanna ordered a tall glass of lemonade and turned to look at the trembling blond.</P>
<P>"Sit down, Seven." It wasn't an invitation and Seven complied immediately.</P>
<P>"You broke my jaw, this afternoon, did you know that?" B'Elanna asked conversationally as she took a sip of her drink. "I had to tell the doctor that we working on a fitness regime and I forgot to duck." She watched as tears filled the Borg's eyes. She sighed, put her glass down and sat beside the contrite drone.</P>
<P>"I am so sorry, I'm so sorry, you must know how sorry I am," Seven clasped B'Elanna's hands in her own, not even realising that for the second time that day she had used a contraction in her speech. The tears were running down her face unheeded.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked into Seven's eyes and the pain that she hid in engineering was clear.</P>
<P>"Seven I know you're sorry and I accept your apology, but you have to understand something." She raised her hand to wipe away the tears.</P>
<P>"You are stronger than me, you always will be, and even though I know and I understand that these emotions are new to you, you will need to handle them better. I promise I'll help you with that." She put her hands on either side of Seven's face and brought it close to hers. </P>
<P>"If you ever hit me again, I will never, ever forgive you." She stared deep into Seven's eyes to make sure that she understood. "Do you understand what I'm saying, Seven?"</P>
<P>Seven swallowed hard and nodded, the utter contempt and shame that bound her chest like a vice loosened, ever so slightly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna finally smiled gently, sadly and pulled Seven close and rocked her gently as she sobbed into the Klingon's shoulder.</P>
<P>Exhausted Seven fell into a fitfully sleep her head resting comfortably on B'Elanna's lap. </P>
<I>
<P>Where do we go from here? Can I really allow myself to love her? Will she be able to</I> <I>handle it?</I> There was a jumble of thoughts running through B'Elanna's head as she stroked the blond hair splayed out on her lap. She smiled slightly as she glanced at the gifts her lover had brought her. She picked up the data padd and read the words.</P>
<P><I>There's no words to say<BR>
No words to convey<BR>
This feeling inside I have for you<BR>
Deep in my heart<BR>
Safe from the guards <BR>
Of intellect and reason<BR>
Leaving me at a loss<BR>
For words to express my feelings<BR>
Deep in my heart<BR>
Look at me losing control<BR>
Thinking I had a hold<BR>
But with feelings this strong<BR>
I'm no longer the master <BR>
Of my emotions.</I></P>
<P>B'Elanna put the data padd down and allowed her own tears to fall.</P>

<P>"Hey, Harry, Harry, wait up," Tom jogged down the corridor to meet his friend as hey made their way to the bridge.</P>
<P>"Did you hear what the doctor's been saying?"</P>
<P>"No, what new gossip have you got?"</P>
<P>"He said that Seven broke B'Elanna's jaw this morning. Can you believe that?"</P>
<P>"What, no way."</P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna looked at the sleeping woman and checked the time. She knew that Seven wouldn't be on duty for another 8 hours and she herself didn't need to be back for a while.</P>
<P>Very carefully, she lifted Seven and took her to the darkened bedroom. She hadn't realised that Seven could sleep so soundly. She placed her tenderly on the bed and looked at her, B'Elanna's heart hurt so much just to look at her. She knew without any doubt that she was falling headlong in love with Seven and couldn't do a damn thing about it.</P>
<P>She knelt down beside the bed and took off Seven's boots, she didn't want to wake her. B'Elanna sat on the bed with Seven's feet on her lap, she had been staring at them for the last 10 minutes, they were pale and slender and she had the cutest little implant on her ankle.</P>
<I><P>B'Elanna can you hear yourself? Your calling a Borg implant cute. Are you nuts? Boy you've got it bad.</P>
</I>
<P>She stood up and debated whether she should help Seven out of her of biosuit. On the one hand, Seven would sleep more comfortable without the tight restraining clothing, but on the other, B'Elanna had heard the rumours, seven was supposed to be stark naked underneath. That made her mind up for her. </P>
<P>"There's no way I can take the sensory overload of dealing with a big, naked Borg in my bed." She muttered to herself as she took off her uniform jacket and lay beside Seven.</P>
<P>Sometime during the night she heard Seven whimpering in her sleep and rolled over to cradle the sleeping Borg.</P>
<P>"Please forgive me, please forgive. I'm sorry ..." Seven mumbled in her sleep. She was tossing about on the bed, clearly in the grip of a nightmare. B'Elanna held her close and whispered gently in the cloud of blond hair.</P>
<P>"Hush, hush, darling, don't speak It's ok. It's over now. It's all over now." </P>
<P>B'Elanna continued to rock Seven, gently reassuring her, until the nightmare ended.</P>

<P>Several hours later, Seven woke up alone in B'Elanna's bed. She was still in her blue biosuit and had a blanket wrapped carefully around her.</P>
<P>She sat up and immediately groaned. Her head hurt, there was a dull throbbing and realised that she had a splitting headache. She walked to the bathroom checking the time. She had slept for over 5 hours, it was a strange sensation, sleeping. All Seven could recall was her unconscious mind being filled with images of her hurting B'Elanna over and over again, of being unable to stop hurting the woman she knew she loved. The nightmare had only stopped when she felt herself being cradled and loved the arms of the one she loved.</P>
<P>"Is this love?" Seven knew it was illogical, but she asked her reflection the question anyway.</P>
<P>Her reflection looked like shit and couldn't be bothered to respond. Seven's eyes were red and puffy and she had dark smudges under her eyes. Her chest felt tight and heavy. Seven knew that the guilt and self-loathing that she felt at her actions were like physical injuries that she didn't know how to heal.</P>
<P> Once she completed her toilette she walked through to the lounge with the intention of going back on duty, even though she wasn't due for a few hours yet.</P>
<P>On the table were several covered dishes and a data padd with a recorded message from B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven, I'll be back by 0600 hours. I want you to wait for me. We need to talk. (What, again? Just get on with it already. Author)</P>
<P> I know you need to eat so I've replicated a light meal for you. You should also drink the mug of papaya and kelp juice. I know it tastes foul, but it will soothe your headache. I ... I'll see you soon."</P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed to be on the verge of saying something else but signed off instead.</P>
<I><P>She still cares for my well being. Could she have really forgiven me?</I> Seven wondered as she tried to eat the meal that B'Elanna had prepared. The food tasted like ashes in her mouth, but her headache did ease as soon as she drank the strange concoction. Irrationally, Seven wished that she still had the pounding head. She deserved to suffer.</P>

<P>Her fork clattered onto her plate as the doors slid open and B'Elanna walked in. Seven met her gaze for the shortest of seconds and dropped her eyes to the floor. She couldn't bear to look at her.</P>
<P>B'Elanna strode over to her and gently grasped Seven by the chin, forcing her to look up and meet her eyes.</P>
<P>"Seven, look at me, I'm not angry at you any more. I know that you'll never do it again and I don't want us to keep going on about it. It's over. Let's move on."</P>
<P>The tears trembled on Seven's long black eyelashes.</P>
<P>"How can we go on. Where do we start?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna sank down to her knees between Seven's legs and leaned close.</P>
<P>"We start at the beginning and we take it slow. I'll teach you about love and emotions," the Klingon said softly as she gently traced the curve of Seven's shell-like ear. "And you can teach me about love and emotions," she continued, brushing her thumb along the shadows under Seven's eyes. "We both have a lot to learn about this relationship, but I promise you, we're going to make it work."</P>
<P>She leaned closer, her breath warm and sweet on Seven's face, her hands holding the blonde's face tenderly. "Do you believe me, Seven?" </P>
<P>Seven barely nodded, she was mesmerised by B'Elanna mouth.</P>
<P>"Good, I don't want you shedding any more tears," she whispered as the tip of her tongue gently lifted the teardrops from Seven's lashes. "Is that understood?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded again, her heart pounding, she ached at their closeness, desperately wanting more.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's mouth travelled gently and oh, so slowly to the corner of Seven's mouth and placed a gentle, chaste kiss there, moved to the cleft in her chin and flicked her tongue at it. Seven couldn't help it, she moaned, sliding off the chair to be even closer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna needed Seven's closeness just as much, despite saying that they would take it slow, she wanted this, needed this. </P>
<P>Gently she took Seven's lower lip and sucked it softly, enjoying the softness, going out of her mind by the tiny whimpers coming from Seven. B'Elanna moved to the upper lip savouring every sensation.</P>
<P>Seven was gripping her by her shoulders, wanting more.</P>
<P>"Do you like that, baby?" B'Elanna teased softly, her tongue delving into the waiting mouth, caressing the soft, sweet tasting ...</P>

<P>Gently she took Seven's lower lip and sucked it softly, enjoying the softness, going out of her mind by the tiny whimpers coming from Seven. B'Elanna moved to the upper lip savouring every sensation.</P>
<P>Seven was gripping her by her shoulders, wanting more.</P>
<P>"Do you like that, baby?" B'Elanna teased softly, her tongue delving into the waiting mouth, caressing the soft, sweet tasting lips. She teased some more, her sharp white teeth gently nipping at Seven's full and pouty lower lip.</P>
<P>"Do you like it, honey?" B'Elanna breathed.</P>
<P>"Mmmm,"</P>
<P>Seven was a quick learner and she soon became the aggressor, wanting more from B'Elanna. Her mouth opened wider and she thrust her tongue deeper in to B'Elanna's mouth, their tongues duelling. Eventually they had to come up for air and even though B'Elanna's head was spinning, still she wanted more.</P>
<P>She began to drop tiny open-mouthed kisses along Seven's jaw and her neck. She trailed kisses along the beautiful slender throat until she found a spot that fascinated her. She could feel the blood rushing through Seven's veins at the pulse point and the knowledge that she caused this reaction was intoxicating.</P>
<P>All along B'Elanna had kept her hands to herself, but she decided to remedy that mistake straight away by slowly trailing her fingertips along Seven's ribcage. She stopped at her waist and slowly stroked them back, skimming the sides of the ex-drones breast. B'Elanna smiled as she heard the jagged breathing stop for a full minute.</P>
<P>Her mouth was still occupied by Seven's throat but she halted her ministrations for a second.</P>
<P>"Breathe, sweetheart, just breathe." </P>
<P>Seven was rapidly becoming unravelled, the very core of her being was molten hot and she didn't know long she could stand it. </P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at Seven, her eyes were heavy lidded and their colour was almost black, her soft lips were red and swollen and she was panting softly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's brain told her to stop while she still could but she wanted more, just a little more. Seven's nipples were clearly erect through her biosuit and begging for attention. B'Elanna happily obliged. She cupped one breast in her hand, massaging it softly and closed her hot mouth round the turgid nipple of the other.</P>
<P>Seven thought she'd died and gone to Stovokor. She thrust her hand into B'Elanna rich dark hair, holding her closer and panted out,</P>
<P>"I want your mouth on my skin. Now. You must comply."</P>
<P>B'Elanna sucked harder on the nipple, she could feel Seven trembling and knew that she was close. She also knew that Seven deserved much better than this. Rolling around on the floor wasn't good enough, she deserved a beautiful moonlit night, candles and silken sheets. Slowly she gentled her lover, and brought them both back down from the incredible heights they had just reached.</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, her hearts were pounding so loudly she could barely hear herself think. <I>If we are this good together fully clothed</I>, she shied away from the thought of the delights that truly making love to Seven would bring. <I>If I start thinking about that, I will never be able to sleep again. </I>B'Elanna pushed her hair out of her face with shaking hands. Seven was leaning back against the sofa, her eyes still heavy-lidded and sexy. She was also pouting.</P>
<P>"I do not wish to cease this activity."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled and leaned forward to place a gentle kiss on Seven's lips, but within seconds they were both burning again.</P>
<P>"We have got to stop," she dragged herself away and pulled Seven to her feet.</P>
<P>"Why?" Seven was less than amused.</P>
<P>"Because we need to take it slow. I've exposed you to a host of new emotions and you need time to be able to process them and live with them," </P>
<P>B'Elanna couldn't take her hands off Seven quite just yet, so she satisfied herself by holding, stroking Seven's borg-enhanced hand. She played with the palm, lightly tracing patterns on the soft, supple flesh until she realised that even that was turning them both on.</P>
<P>"This is going to be a nightmare," she muttered to herself.</P>
<P>Seven moved in close and rubbed herself up against the Klingon, "It does not have to be this way."</P>
<P>B'Elanna gulped and firmly moved the 6-foot amorous woman aside.</P>
<P>"Don't tell me you know how to be seductive as well as cute and vulnerable?" she saw the expression in Seven's eyes and quickly added.</P>
<P>"Don't even answer that." She looked around her quarters, there was no way that they could stay there without getting into a whole world of trouble so B'Elanna made a sensible, but boring decision.</P>
<P>"Go fix your hair and we can have breakfast together in the mess hall."</P>
<P>Seven pouted, she intuitively knew the effect it had on B'Elanna's heart rate.</P>
<P>"It would be more conducive to my wellbeing if we stayed here," she tried it on.</P>
<P>"Oh I'm sure," the Klingon smirked. She took Seven by the shoulders and turned her into the direction of the bedroom, swatting her lightly on the butt to help her along. </P>

<P>Maybe things were going to be all right.</P>

<P>The senior staff was seated around the conference table, listening to Seven's analysis of the M -class planet they had spent 3 weeks travelling to. Voyager was just outside it's solar system and had used both long-range scanners and passive scans to determine if the planet could supply any of the resources that the ship desperately needed and it's level of technological advancement.</P>
<P>"According to our sensor readings, Ensign Kim and I have determined that this planet has 12 major continents and 4 ocean masses. It's is considerably larger than Earth but has a similar oxygenated environment. The average temperature is 70 degrees on the western most landmass and the average rainfall is approximately 1200 microns per annum." Seven was nothing if not thorough.</P>
<P>"This is one of the more technologically advanced races that we have encountered, I  believe that we may be in a position to share our technology and learn from their own without the usual debate about the Prime Directive."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Seven," Janeway turned to the team. I think that our next action will be either to initiate first contact or to send observers to the planet surface. It would appear that they've got plenty of what we need."</P>
<P>"That's right," Harry added enthusiastically, "Some of the advancements they appear to have made in deflector technology appear to be astounding. I can't wait to get there."</P>
<P>"Don't pack your swimsuit just yet, Harry, we still need to be invited. We don't how this race will react to us. They are warp capable without any doubt, but we haven't detected any ion trails." Chakotay looked at Tuvok for confirmation.</P>
<P>"That is correct, Commander, it is evident that we will need to ...</P>

<P>B'Elanna tuned out, kind of. She was paying attention after all. But all of her attention was focused on Seven.</P>
<I><P>Damn, but she soooo cute when she's serious.</I> She frowned to herself, Since when do I use the word cute? </P>
<P>Seven returned to her seat beside B'Elanna and gave her a sidelong stare as she sat down.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres," she whispered, "you are not paying sufficient attention, what are you doing?"</P>
<P>" I'm just sitting here, daydreaming about you," B'Elanna whispered back. </P>
<P>"... Don't you think, Lieutenant?" the Captain asked the startled engineer.</P>
<P>"I think that's a valid point, Captain," B'Elanna replied without missing a beat. </P>
<P>Janeway nodded apparently satisfied with the response and turned back to Chakotay. Only Tukok noticed the twinkle in her eye.</P>
<P>" I prefer the more direct approach, we'll present ourselves on their doorstep and defy them to send us away," Janeway joked.</P>
<P>"Have Neelix break into full ambassador mode, also make sure that his recipe database is fully up to date. We have no idea what passes for currency on this homeworld."</P>
<P>"Captain, I very much doubt that we're going to get a tonne of dilithium in exchange for Neelix's chilli con carne recipe," Tom was sceptical.</P>
<P>"Whatever they want, within reason, I'm willing to barter," Janeway instructed. "B'Elanna, have Voyagers schematics updated to include the borg-related adjustments."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma'am." B'Elanna wasn't going to be caught twice.</P>
<P>"Seven, all of our star charts, have them ready." </P>
<P>Seven inclined her head in acknowledgement. </P>
<P>"Tom, lay in a course." The Captain stood indicating the end of the meeting.</P>
<P>"Dismissed."</P>

<P>Janeway was in her ready room, reading over reports. She was hoping that this expedition went well. They really needed to stock up on resources and it would be nice if the crew could get some shoreleave into the bargain. Everyone had been working double shifts for months now, to keep the ship running. Despite her orders to the contrary, she knew that B'Elanna in particular had had almost quadrupled the amount of time she spent on duty. The only other person who had put in anything like that level of work had been Seven. It appeared that she now spent a good portion of her time working in Engineering as well as Astrometrics. She was becoming an excellent engineer under B'Elanna's tutelage.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled as she recalled the last time she paid a visit to engineering. It was well into the gamma shift and most of deck 10 was deserted.</P>
<P>She found Seven and B'Elanna in a heated debate over a particularly convoluted aspect of the warp core. She stood, unseen, for a brief moment and observed how the two women interacted with each other.</P>
<P>If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, Janeway would never have believed how patient B'Elanna could be. The Klingon painstaking explained the workings and results of the problem they were dealing. It was as if she was teaching Seven her life's craft, passing on all the secrets of her profession.</P>
<P>She spent some time with them, chatting. Janeway chuckled out loud as she recalled making an innocent comment about Seven being almost as good an engineer as Torres. The Klingon had been mock indignant, stating that if the engines heard Janeway, they would sulk for weeks at the thought of anyone else caring for them. </P>
<P>Despite the professionalism that both women displayed, even when there was no one watching, Janeway couldn't help but notice the ever so subtle body language that the two now shared. Sometimes it seemed as if they could also sense each other thoughts and actions.</P>
<P>Even though she had absolutely nothing to do with their joining, Janeway was inordinately proud of the pair. She hoped that they had a very long and rewarding relationship. She knew that neither of them were angels, B'Elanna with her volatile temper and Seven's ice-cold condescension would undoubtedly lead to sparks at some stage, but now they both displayed the maturity and love for each other to weather any storm.</P>
<P>Chakotay requesting her presence on the bridge jogged Janeway out of her musings.</P>
<P>"Now what?" she muttered to herself as she made her way to the bridge. They weren't due to arrive at the planet's co-ordinates for another 2 hours.</P>
<P>"Report?" she took her seat as her first officer made room for her(on his lap)</P>
<P>"We have discovered some unusual reading from the planet," Tuvok intoned gravely. "Seven has confirmed them via sensor readings."</P>
<P>"The planet is encased within a strange phenomena," Chakotay took up the story. "The closest we've got to analysing the phenomena is that it's some form of electromagnetic pulse in the outer stratoshere."</P>
<P>Janeway frown slightly, that didn't sound too serious. " On screen."</P>
<P>The red-brown planet flashed up on the view screen.</P>
<P>Janeway looked round. "Looks fine to me."</P>
<P>"Ma'am, Seven made some modifications to the standard sensors scans and using them, we get this." Harry fiddled with his console and a new image appeared in the screen, this time there clearly could be seen a swirling mist of static charges and pules surrounding the planet.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna doesn't think that a warp field can be sustained within this phenomena," Chakotay said, handing a data padd to the Captain.</P>
<P>"Would this explain why we couldn't detect any ion trails?" Janeway asked as she scrolled through the information.</P>
<P>"I guess it's possible." Harry didn't sound too sure.</P>
<P>Tom, who had been pretty much silent up until now turned from the helm to face the Captain and Chakotay.</P>
<P>"Surely a race that's supposedly quite advanced should have found a way to combat the effects of that, that ... whatever it is," he gestured to the viewscreen.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Paris has made a valid point, Captain." Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Don't sound so surprised, Tuvok. I can come up with a gem every so often," Tom grinned as he swung back to his console.</P>
<P>"Indeed." Tuvok merely raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Fact is we don't know whether they've broken the warp barrier or not. For all we know, they could be a race that just simply like to stay home," Chakotay shrugged.</P>
<P>"I don't think so, not with all that technology we detected," Harry objected.</P>
<P>"We're not going to get any where by speculating," Janeway called a halt to the discussion.  </P>
<P>"First things first, we need to find whether we can even get near the planet. Chakotay, get B'Elanna to work on a way to cut through that stuff. Harry, you give her a hand. And while you're at it, see what effect this thing will have on our transporters," Janeway got up a walked to the turbolift, still firing instruction to her first officer </P>
<P>"Have the doctor find out whether it will have any effect on the crew. I'm going to Astrometrics to find out more about this latest challenge." She was grinning as the doors swished closed.</P>
<P>Chakotay grinned, the Captain did so like a challenge.</P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna sat on the sofa in her quarters in her tank top and trousers, her jacket and boots dumped on the floor by the door. She was tired. No, she was bone weary. It had taken over a week of working round the clock to protect the warp core and the engines so that Voyager could get within a light year of the planet, let alone enter their atmosphere. She and Harry had finally managed to find a way of transporting through the magnomemetic field as the Kalahari called it.</P>
<P>Janeway had initiated contact via communications and negotiations seemed to be going well. After an initial bout of natural wariness they were willing to open up a limited trade agreement with Voyager. A delegation of Kalahari ministers was due to beam to Voyager in a few days time and if all went well the Captain would visit the planet soon after. </P>
<P>B'Elanna tried to review her list of things to finish up but she was too tired. She wasn't even sure what day it was. She was hungry and irritable, she couldn't remember when last she got to talk to Seven, let alone spend time with her. And that pissed the Klingon off. They had got into the routine of leaving messages for each other in B'Elanna's quarters and though it was kind of fun to read Seven's love notes, she wanted the real thing. The only consolation had been that instead of regenerating, Seven often slept in B'Elanna's bed and even though their brutal work schedule meant that they hadn't managed to share a night together, B'Elanna's sheets always retained a faint hint of Seven's unique fragrance and that helped B'Elanna to sleep.</P>
<P>B'Elanna needed to wind down a little before hitting the shower and bed, she was over-tired and jumpy.</P>
<P>"Computer, play classical file alpha 1, maximum volume." she instructed. As soon as the strains of the violin washed over her, B'Elanna felt her heart rate slow and her body relax. This was one of her favourite pieces of classical earth music. It always brought her calm.</P>
<P>She leaned back and closed her eyes, a small smile playing on her lips. Sensing something, she snapped her eyes open and her jaw dropped as a very sleepy, scantily clothed drone padded out of her bedroom.</P>
<P>"Computer, stop playback." She opened her arms as Seven sat down beside her on the sofa and snuggled up, sighing happily as she wrapped her arms around B'Elanna. It was evident she was still half-asleep. Her hair fell down to her shoulders and she was wearing a shirt that B'Elanna often wore to bed. It was huge on the tiny Klingon, but on Seven it barely skimmed her shapely hips.</P>
<P>Seven, I'm sorry, honey, I didn't check." B'Elanna gently stroked the long blond tresses and placed a kiss on her forehead.</P>
<P>"Mmmmm."</P>
<P>"You ok?" B'Elanna was amused at the sleepy drone.</P>
<P>"Mmmmm. Play the music again, I found it pleasing."</P>
<P>As the music began to play, B'Elanna realised that she couldn't think of a time when she'd been happier. The feeling that the music gave her coupled with having Seven practically curled up on her lap made her heart soar. The tiredness and irritations of the day melted away.</P>
<P>"I am that bird, d'you know that?" B'Elanna whispered softly into Seven's hair. She thought that Seven had fallen asleep in her arms and couldn't hear her. "I am soaring, higher and higher above the clouds and the sea." </P>
<P>She kissed her beloved's forehead again. "You do that to me, do you know that? You make me as free as a bird. "</P>

<P>By the time B'Elanna woke the next morning, Seven had already left. They had spent the night on the sofa, wrapped in each other's arms. But despite that, B'Elanna felt relaxed and properly rested.</P>
<P>She stood, stretched and yawned expansively as she made her way to the bathroom, when a flat parcel caught her eye.</P>
<P>She strolled over to it curiously, it had been wrapped by what could only be borg precision, but when she finally opened it her heart stopped.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>It was entitled <B>Lark Ascending</B> and it depicted two larks floating in clear blue skies.</P>
<P>There was a small inscription on the back of the painting. </P>
<I><P>Only when I am with you, am I truly free. </P>
</I><P> </P>
<hr>

<P>"I'm telling you, Tom, I just don't trust them. There's something that just doesn't feel right."</P>
<P>B'Elanna and Tom were eating in the mess hall. They had both come back from the Kalahari planet where they had both been involved in various cultural exchanges. </P>
<P>The Captain and the Kalahari First Minister had agreed a trade package where Voyager could get all the supplies and resources that they needed and the crew would offer in exchange their cultural diversity and technical expertise. Despite appearing to be a technologically advanced race, the Kalahari were a race that borrowed and bought technology rather than creating their own advances. </P>
<P>"How do you mean?"</P>
<P>"I can't really explain it, but I can't seem to trust a race of people that don't develop their own technology and simply use someone else's. It doesn't seem right."</P>
<P>"Yeah well they all sure look good," Tom grinned.</P>
<P>"Sure if you like tall, gangly, violet eyed albinos. How the hell is it that they all look almost identical? And what's with all those other species that seem to visit and never leave?"</P>
<P>"You're just paranoid," Tom said lazily. He looked up as Seven approached their table.</P>
<P>"May I join you," she asked politely.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked up at Seven through her lashes, smiling lightly. Though they had not hidden their relationship from anyone, Seven was always strictly professional with B'Elanna while they were on duty. </P>
<P>"Sure, Seven, take a seat." Tom invited, grinning wickedly.</P>
<P>Seven slid in the seat beside Tom, so that she could be opposite B'Elanna who immediately pushed her tray away and leaned forward, picking up Seven's hands.</P>
<P>"Been back to the planet?" B'Elanna asked idly as she stroked the back of the borgs hands with her thumbs. She knew that Seven's hands were incredibly sensitive and this gentle caress always distracted her. B'Elanna's smile widened as she saw Seven's pupils dilate.</P>
<P>"Seven? The planet?" B'Elanna teased.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed hard and tried to concentrate.</P>
<P>"I have completed my duties updating the Kalahari sensor arrays and the Captain has assigned me to work with you to complete the matrix conversion. Lieutenant, I need my hands to consume my meal." </P>
<P>She licked her lips, her mouth having gone dry at the sensations the simple caresses were having on her. Her legs felt weak.</P>
<P>"You only need one hand to eat," B'Elanna relented, freeing one hand. Her eyes narrowed at the sight of Seven's pink tongue and she growled very softly, knowing that only Seven would be able to pick up the faint sound.</P>
<P>Seven dropped her fork.</P>
<P>"Would the pair of you knock it off, I'm trying to eat here," Tom complained.</P>
<P>"Tom, get lost." B'Elanna didn't take her eyes off Seven, who was having trouble breathing.</P>
<P>"You've been together months now, surely. Yet you're both acting like ...." He paused and looked from B'Elanna to Seven.</P>
<P>"Shut up, Tom." He was one of the few people who could actually make her blush.</P>
<P>"You haven't done it yet, have you?" he was laughing openly.</P>
<P>"What is it that we have not yet done?" Seven asked (innocently)</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned to look at her, her eyes narrowed, was Seven giving her a little payback?</P>
<P>"You know, the nasty" Tom elaborated.</P>
<P>"I am sure what B'Elanna and I have planned will be anything but nasty." She gave her stunned love a slow wink and continued with her meal.</P>
<P>"I know this is new to you both and all, but what's the hold up. D'you want me to draw you a diagram?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna finally look her eyes off Seven and turned to Tom.</P>
<P>"If you don't leave now, I'm going to break your neck. Understood?" She smiled sweetly as she uttered the threat.</P>
<P>Tom picked up his tray, still laughing.</P>
<P>"Enjoy. And I don't mean just the meal."</P>
<P>"Now, where was I?" B'Elanna turned her intent and hungry stare back at the ex-drone.</P>
<P>"Feed me." </P>
<P>Seven was startled at the request. She looked at B'Elanna to see if she was serious and her blue gaze met head on with hot burning coals of desire.</P>
<P> She had no real vanity, but the fact that the inordinately beautiful and intelligent engineer desired her, filled Seven with a warm, sweet pleasure.</P>
<P>"Feed me," B'Elanna repeated the request, this time with a throaty growl.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seven picked a piece of meat from her plate with her fingers and dipped it in the spicy sauce. She leaned over the table and carefully carried the morsel to B'Elanna's lips, and popped the piece in, making sure to brush those full lips as she did. She didn't take her eyes off the Klingon as she repeated the action, this time her fingers straying for a second inside the warm, moist cavern of B'Elanna's mouth.</P>
<P>"More?" she asked the question coolly, but inside she was on fire</P>
<P>B'Elanna nodded, mutely enjoying every minute of the seduction. They were both completely oblivious to their surroundings. Nothing else existed for them except each other.</P>
<P>This time, Seven allowed her fingers to stay a little longer and was rewarded when B'Elanna sucked and nibbled before releasing them. A drop of sauce had strayed to the corner of B'Elanna's mouth and though Seven was dying to lick it off, she contented herself by brushing her thumb over the drop and B'Elanna's lower lip and slowly sucking her digit clean.</P>
<P>"Janeway to Torres."</P>
<P>The Captain's voice bought them both crashing to earth. Blinking, B'Elanna responded.</P>
<P>"Torres here, Captain." Her voice was very throaty.</P>
<P>"Are you alright, Lieutenant?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna cleared her throat hurriedly," Fine, Captain. What can I do for you?"</P>
<P>"I'd like you to come to my ready room to work out a schedule of completion of the Kalahari request."</P>
<P>"I'll be there, right away, Captain."</P>
<P>"Acknowledged. Janeway out."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled ruefully at Seven. </P>
<P>"The Captains interruption, though frustrating, was undoubtedly fortuitous." Seven observed calmly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna could read Seven's emotions like a book and knew that her darling was anything but calm, regardless of appearances.</P>
<P>"How so? I, for one would have been quite happy to continue." She protested.</P>
<P>"Had we continued, I have no doubt that we would have resulted in making love, right here in the mess hall." The was a wealth of amusement and something deeper in her comment.</P>
<P>B'Elanna grinned slightly at that and stood, preparing to leave. She rested her hand on Seven's nape and stroked it gently, she knew that Seven loved it.</P>
<P>"As soon as I've finished with the Captain, I need to return to the planet. Come with me?"</P>
<P>"Of course."</P>
<P>"Good. I..., I'll see you later."</P>
<P>An emotion, something that Seven couldn't quite identify flickered in B'Elanna's eyes and then she was gone.</P>
<I>
<P>You are such a coward. Why can't you just tell her? They're just 3 little words. You are such a spineless little wimp.</P>
</I><P>B'Elanna continued to berate herself all the way the Captain's ready room.</P>
<I>
<P>What's the worse that could happen? She says she's not in love with you. So what? Life goes on and besides, you KNOW Seven's in love with you. It's written all over her face every time she sees you. She probably expects you to take a lead. Have a little faith in her. Trust her.</P>
</I>
<P>She arrived at the Captain's ready room, feeling much better. Janeway was munching on a snack when the engineer announced herself.</P>
<P>"Ah, B'Elanna, would you like to join me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna couldn't help the smirk that sprang to her face. "Thank you, Captain. I've just eaten."</P>
<P>How's the work going with the Kalahari? Tuvok, Neelix and I have completed enough cultural exchanges to last me a lifetime. We've visited the Arts Sectors, the Spiritual Centre and the Literature Division. We've seen their farming techniques but very little in the way of science and technology. Do you have any insight on this?"</P>
<P>"It was my intention to provide you with a full report once this mission is over ..."</P>
<P>"I know you've got your hands full replenishing our supplies, working on the engines and working with the Kalahari. I just wanted a little background information. The First Minister and his delegation are always very evasive whenever I broach the subject and since we are getting more than we ever thought possible in terms of resources, I didn't want to push it," Janeway explained.</P>
<P>B'Elanna folded her arms and considered the Captain, she knew the information  would piss the Captain off, big time.</P>
<P>"The Kalahari have no real technology of their own. From what Harry and I gather, over the last couple of millennia, they've borrowed or bought most of their so-called technological advances. Even the magnomemetic field comes from another species, it's not a natural phenomena and one of its functions is to preserve the climate of the planet." B'Elanna continued, getting more irate as she listed a catalogue of inadequacies.</P>
<P>"They couldn't be bothered to try and find a way of beating it, they just shrugged their shoulders and that was it. The only reason they don't have warp drive technology is because they are too lazy to try and work around that field of theirs."</P>
<P>Janeway's eyebrows nearly disappeared into her hairline. To say she was surprised was putting it mildly.</P>
<P>"I know how badly we need their resources, which is why I haven't said anything, but the only thing my team and I have been doing these last 3 weeks is repairing or updating or maintenance of all their mechanical infrastructure and technology."</P>
<P>"How is it even possible to live that way?"</P>
<P>"They do have some so-called engineers who see to the day to day running of things and they seem to have a fair number of alien species who've apparently mated with a Kalahari and become some sort of technical assistant."</P>
<P>"I'm astounded, they have clearly developed incredible artist and musicians and writers and, and great thinkers. How in the world could they have neglected the sciences?"</P>
<P>"I don't even know where to start on that one, Captain."</P>
<P>B'Elanna wondered if she should mention Nordik, the technician who'd been assigned to work with her, but decided against it. The huge lurking male would get over his crush on her soon enough and besides, they were due to leave the planet in another few days. Nothing much could happen in a few days.</P>
