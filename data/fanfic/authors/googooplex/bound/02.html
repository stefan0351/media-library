<P>B'Elanna looked up as Nordik brush past her again. She had already explained to him that she didn't like it and that humans liked to maintain a personal space, but the message wasn't getting through. She sighed and took another deep breath. The last time he had done it, a few days ago, she had bitten his head off and he acted like a whipped puppy and made so many mistakes with his calibrations that it had set them back another 12 hours. This was, Kahless willing, their last full day and B'Elanna had given her team some much-needed time off. She and Seven, with the dubious help of Nordik, should be done by nightfall.</P>
<P>Nordik had been a bit twitchy today, but she guess it was because she was leaving. To be honest, she couldn't wait to get out of his sight. Regardless of her feeling for Seven, she didn't have any aversion to men, but Nordik made her skin crawl. </P>
<P>Tom had told her that with her dark hair, eyes and skin, she was probably every Kalahari male's wet dream as the planet was populated by tall, albino-like humanoids with violet eyes.</P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled as she recalled smacking him upside the head for his impudence.</P>
<P>Seven, over at the other end of the designated science area, was becoming severely irritated by the readings, no matter have many times she checked the input or changed the variables, or ran the programme, the results from the matrix converter continued to remained the exactly the same even though she knew that it was impossible. It had taken hours to set up the parameters for the test but if she couldn't complete her task on time, it would set the whole project back. </P>
<P>And that would interfere with the time she could spend with B'Elanna. </P>
<P>Which was unacceptable.</P>
<P>She ran a diagnostic check.  Everything was working within specified parameters. Good.</P>
<P>She checked her instrument panel for misalignments. There were none. </P>
<P>She used her tricorder to run a self-diagnostic. She was working perfectly. Good.</P>
<P>Seven carried out the matrix converter programme again, and checked the readings. </P>
<P>They hadn't changed.</P>
<B><I><U><P>FUCK IT ALL TO ABSOLUTE HELL!!!</P>
</B></I></U><P>A small gasped escaped Seven's lips. She hadn't uttered the obscenities out loud, but she was shocked that she had even thought them. Her hands shot up to cover her mouth as if to prevent to words actually coming to life.</P>
<P>B'Elanna, working at the other end of the chamber, heard Seven yelp and strolled over to check if she was alright.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she questioned curiously. Seven still had her hands over her mouth and her gorgeous blue eyes were wide with amazement.</P>
<P>"What is it?"</P>
<P>Seven flushed a delicious shade of pink as she let her hands drop.</P>
<P>"I ... I thought a profanity." She was mortified.</P>
<P>"You did what?" the Klingon grinned.</P>
<P>"It came to my mind suddenly, I had no control over the words."</P>
<P>B'Elanna started to giggle, " Come on, Seven, give. What words did you think?"</P>
<P>Seven was scandalised,  " I would be inappropriate for me to repeat them," she looked around nervously. "The Kalahari might overhear me."</P>
<P>B'Elanna began to laugh so hard that she needed support.  " Tell me!"</P>
<P>Checking make sure that their hosts were out of earshot, Seven muttered, unhappily, " Fuck it all to absolute hell." </P>
<P>She blushed an even darker shade of pink and her hands were fluttering distractedly at her sides.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped laughing long enough to see Seven's discomfort.</P>
<I><P>She is an absolute angel</I>, B'Elanna thought as she caught up Seven's still fluttering hands.</P>
<P>"You are utterly adorable, do you know that?" </P>
<P>Protocol be damned she thought as she kissed Seven's fingers, still grinning. </P>
<P>"I love you so much."</P>
<P>Neither of them were prepared for that.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes widened with joy at the declaration and B'Elanna went very still.</P>
<P>She gently kissed Seven's inner wrist and took a moment to compose herself. A warm blanket of peace settled over her.</P>
<P>"Do you have any idea how good it feels to say those words to you, Seven? I love you so very much. I never want to be apart from you." B'Elanna swallowed hard, she wanted to cry. She couldn't understand why it had taken her so long to admit these feelings out loud, but now that she had, it felt so good.</P>
<P>Seven draped her hands over B'Elanna's shoulders and clasped them loosely and leaned her forehead against B'Elanna ridges.</P>
<P>"And I love you, my dearest friend."</P>

<P>B'Elanna couldn't stop smiling, her heart was literally overflowing with happiness. She stole a quick look at Seven, working at the other end of the matrix conversion chamber and giggled out loud.</P>
<P>Not even the lumbering Nordik could break her out of her good mood. They had nearly completed their assignment and should be able to return to Voyager in another 6 or 7 hours. She couldn't wait. She had plans for Seven. Big plans. She swallowed hard as she thought of what she and Seven would with all their free time on Voyager. They were both due for some time off and B'Elanna intended to use it wisely. They would spend it in bed. All of it.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was shaken out of her extremely enjoyable daydream by Nordik coming up to her. Once again he stood far too close.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, in honour of working and trade, please honour me by having this," Despite his immense size, the Kalahari male had a soft and child-like voice. He was offering B'Elanna some form of gift. It was a small, carved wooden box, no more than 6 inches in length. </P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked, not sure how to respond. She wasn't sure she wanted to accept the gesture. One the one hand, she didn't like Nordik, he was a pain in the ass, he kept rubbing up against her and, sin of all sins, he was a lousy engineer. But on the other, this was a diplomatic mission, she didn't want to offend the Kalahari race and, which was the clincher, Seven loved her.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Nordik." She realised that he probably expected her to reciprocate and quickly grabbed up an extra toolkit and presented it to him.</P>
<P>"This is for you on behalf of the engineering team." Nordik smiled in childlike wonder and accepted the gift.</P>
<P>"You have not opened the gift," he urged her.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna suddenly noticed that the carved wooded box in her hands actually had hinges and opened up length-wise. She opened it, curiously.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stared at the contents in silence for a beat.</P>
<P>"You have got to be kidding me!" She snapped the box shut and looked up at the git.</P>
<P>"Is this ...?"</P>
<P>"It is a lock of my hair," he confirmed simply.</P>
<I><P>Yuck</I>. B'Elanna hoped she hadn't said the word out loud. She thrust the box back at Nordik.</P>
<P>"There is no way that I can accept this, Nordik. It is completely inappropriate."</P>
<P>He just looked at her.</P>
<P>"You have already accepted."</P>
<P>She flashed him a grim smile, "My mistake, here, I don't want it."</P>
<P>"You have accepted."</P>
<P>She took a deep breath and tried to explain. "Listen, Nordik, in my culture, certain gifts carry particular significance." She eyed him to see if she was getting through. </P>
<P>"Certain gifts mean friendship, loyalty, love, whatever. This lock of hair is an incredibly personal thing, at least for us humans. I wouldn't feel right accepting it from you. Do you understand?"</P>
<P>Nordik blinked, considering her words carefully.</P>
<P>"It is meant to be personal. You have accepted."</P>

<hr>

<P>Seven was working in an adjoining antechamber and her thoughts were consumed with just one thing.</P>
<I><P>She will not deny us this time.</I> Seven thought. <I>Once the assignment is complete, we will return to Voyager, attend the debriefing meeting and then we shall retire to B'Elanna's quarters. I shall not be satisfied until I have pleasured every inch of her body. I will love her mercilessly until she is weak and begging for release. I will ...</P>
</I>
<P>Seven was distracted from her determined plans for B'Elanna's body by Fretax entering the chamber beside her. </P>
<P>Fretax was Nordik's assistant and had been assigned to help Seven complete her work in the matrix converter. She was one of the ubiquitous aliens that appeared to have decided to live on Kalahari. She was a very competent engineer, much better at her job than Nordik, but very rarely spoke except to Nordik. Seven had deduced that Fretax had some form of emotional attachment to Nordik. Perhaps they were mates.</P>
<P>She looked at the silent little alien.</P>
<P>"Fretax, how may I be of assistance?" she asked politely.</P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna was getting pissed off with the whole affair. She just wanted to finish her assignment and take Seven back home."</P>
<P>"Am I not making myself clear? I do not want your gift. And what the hell do you mean, it's meant to be personal."</P>
<P>"You have consented to be bound to me. That would make it personal." </P>
<P>"Wha...?" B'Elanna couldn't comprehend what was going on. She read the cultural database, as all away teams were required when conducting diplomatic missions and she knew that there was no mention of being bound to anyone for accepting a gift.</P>
<P>"Nordik, I don't know what you think is going to happen here, but I'm not about to be bound or anything else to you. This conversation is over. In fact, this mission is over, you are just going to have to finish up on your own. Seven and I are leaving right now." She turned away, not really believing what had just happened.</P>

<hr>

<P>Fretax stood silently and considered the taller borg.</P>
<P>"I have been instructed to provide you with this instrument." She held out a standard hypospanner to Seven."</P>
<P>Seven looked at it, without taking it from the woman.</P>
<P>"I do not require this hypospanner, you may place it in the toolkit." </P>
<P>"No." Fretax calmly placed the tool on the console beside Seven and walked away.</P>
<P>Seven frowned and considered the departing back of Fretax and the item she left behind. She was at a loss to understand the alien's behaviour. She decided that the reasons for the woman's actions were irrelevant and decided to replace the tool herself.</P>
<P>Within seconds of touching the tool, Seven knew that there was something wrong. Her bionetic implants were malfunctioning. Her respiration and heartbeat suddenly went off the scale and eyes began to loose focus.</P>
<P>Though Seven instantly knew that she had been poisoned, recalling that Fretax had been wearing latex gloves, but, her first thought was for B'Elanna's safety. As she tried to tap on her combadge, her legs gave way and she collapsed on the floor. She was still conscious despite the crushing pain in her chest and could see out of the antechamber.</P>
<P>At the far end, through her fading vision, she could see B'Elanna with Nordik. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna," she called out, but her voice was weak. Whatever substance had been introduced to her, it was taking effect very quickly. She couldn't feel her legs and her body was rapidly growing cold. </P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna had her back to Nordik as she decided to get Seven and leave, but her instincts made her turn back. His blow met her square in the jaw.</P>
<P>"You will be a better mate than Fretax, you have more talent with engineering. You will bring me much honour."</P>
<P>She didn't stop to think why this was happening, the Klingon in her simply responded to the attack. She highkicked Nordik, catching him unawares, her foot connecting just under his chin.</P>
<P>He didn't even pause, swinging his club-like fist, raining blows down from his great height. </P>
<P>B'Elanna gave every bit as good as she got, but Nordik was too big and too strong, she knew that he would soon be able to wear her down. She couldn't even get her hand to her combadge to get an emergency beam out.</P>
<P>Not taking her eyes off her attacker, she screamed out, </P>
<P>"Seven, I need you."</P>
<P>There was no response and B'Elanna knew that Seven must be hurt. Looking towards the antechamber the borg had been working on she could just about see her Seven's blond hair splayed out on the floor.</P>
<P>A red rush of pure unadulterated rage coursed through Torres and she charged Nordik and grappled with him. She knew that she needed to get him on the floor, she, they had a better chance of survival if she managed it.</P>
<P>Even as she tried to wrestle him, she felt the sting of an injection on the back of her neck. She felt her legs give way and a weakness come over her. As she fell to the floor, she wondered if this would be the day that she died. </P>
<P>"You will make an excellent mate, but you will never resist my will again. We will be bound." Nordik still spoke in the same child-like tone, never taking his vivid violet eyes off her.</P>
<P>Even as he spoke, Nordik continued to kick the prone woman, she tried to curl into a ball to protect herself but she could hear her bones break.</P>
<P>He knelt down beside her and circled her throat with his huge hands.</P>
<P>"I will not kill you. We will be bound. Fretax prepared the dose. I will be happy soon."</P>
<P>"I'd rather die," she forced the words out of her mangled face.</P>
<P>Unexpectedly, Nordik collapsed over her, blood rushing from his head.</P>
<P>Seven had crawled from the antechamber and used the toolkit that B'Elanna had given him to bash Nordik over the head. </P>
<P>She pushed the prone body aside and gathered B'Elanna up in her arms.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna please speak to me," But the Klingon had lapsed into unconsciousness.</P>
<P>"Seven, to Voyager, emergency beam out. Officers injured."</P>


<P>They were beamed directly to sickbay, anxious hands assisting Seven to her feet. The doctor looked over at her, and seeing that she was stable immediately rushed over to the unconscious Klingon.</P>
<P>"What in God's name happened, " the Doctor was appalled at B'Elanna's injuries as he began to assess her. "Seven, what happened?"</P>
<P>The tears were streaming down Seven's face as she struggled to get the words out. </P>
<P>"He kept kicking her when she rejected him," she said brokenly. "She was injected with something. Please don't let her die. B'Elanna must live. She must live." The effects of the drug administered to Seven previously took their toll and she felt herself lapsing into unconsciousness.</P>
<I><P>You must remain awake for B'Elanna,</I> she told herself, instilling steel into her backbone. <I>You must stay be by her side. She needs you.</P>
</I>
<P>"Mr Paris, please tend to Seven."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna needs me, doctor." Tom felt ill as he looked at his friend and ex-wife.</P>
<P>"Tom, you're too close to this, do as they doctor says," the medic insisted.</P>
<P>The doctor looked at the broken Klingon on the biobed and quickly checked her vitals. Her hearts rates were slow, way too slow. Pulse weak and thready. Respiration... none.</P>
<P>"We need to intubate her now, "</P>
<P>He worked quickly with the medic to place the breathing apparatus down B'Elanna's  throat to help her breathe. It was a race against the clock, if oxygen didn't get to her brain and soon, the brain cells would begin to necrotize. </P>
<P>Once they had her breathing stabilised, the Doctor scanned his patient to assess the extent of her injuries.</P>
<P>Massive physical trauma. Broken pelvis, shattered clavicle, almost all of her ribs were broken, puncturing the lungs and there were several skull fractures.</P>
<P> How in the world is that even possible? The Klingons have the hardest skulls in the known galaxy. The doctor moved round the biobed quickly, administering stimulants to keep her hearts beating. Her found out how it was possible to fracture a Klingon skull as he gently turned B'Elanna's head to check the reaction of her pupils. The clear imprint of the hobnailed boot used by Nordik was stamped across B'Elanna's face, crushing her eye socket and shattering the cheekbone.</P>
<P>Just then Janeway rushed in and saw the damage to her engineer. She went a sickly grey colour as approached the bed, but said nothing, at first.</P>
<P>"What the hell happened to my crew?" Her tone was deadly.</P>
<P>"Seven may be able to shed more light on events when she is able. Suffice it to say, B'Elanna is in grave danger." He and a medic were rushing round the biobed try to repair the damage. </P>
<P>The monitors began emitting a high pitch tone.</P>
<P>"Now, what?" the Doctor quickly checked the readings, Janeway reading over his shoulder.</P>
<P>"Her neural patterns are destabilising, Seven said that she was injected with something, but I can't isolate anything in her blood chemistry or her neural pathways."</P>
<P>"You must save her." Seven was inconsolable.</P>
<P>"10mm of cortrozene," the Doctor snapped. "Seven, what did they inject her with? Do you know?"</P>
<P>"The Kalahari called Nordik said that it was so that B'Elanna would be bound to him..."</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"But his mate was jealous, She must have poisoned the drug." Sven's throat was raw from crying but she edged closer to the bed steeling herself to the sight, determined to be of use.</P>
<P>"When B'Elanna rejected him, he... he lost all reason and began a frenzied attack on her. I couldn't help her. I could not stop him. I ... I... " Seven could continue no further.</P>
<P>"I found traces of a paralysing agent in her blood," Tom informed the Captain quietly. " It should have killed her."</P>
<P>Janeway nodded grimly, her eyes fastened on B'Elanna, willing her to fight. </P>
<P>"I need to prepare her for surgery, right now, but I still can't isolate the poison. She may not survive the operation with this pathogen in her system. Captain you need to find out what they used on her."</P>
<P>Janeway nodded curtly and walked over to her unconscious engineer, she leaned close to her ear and whispered.</P>
<P>"Today is not a good day to die. You <B>will</B> survive this. That's an order, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>She strode out of sickbay, pausing only to offer what comfort she could to the stricken Seven.</P>
<P>There was an unnatural quiet of the bridge when she arrived. Chakotay stood and looked at her, worry etched on his face.</P>
<P>"How are they?"</P>
<P>"Not good. B'Elanna's in grave danger. Harry get me the Kalahari First Minister. Open a channel."</P>
<P>The First Minister appeared on the viewscreen. His hair was not as platinum white as his junior minister but his eyes had the same vivid shade of violet.</P>
<P>"Captain, how may I be of service?"</P>
<P>"Two of my crew were viciously assaulted whist working in your technology division. My Chief engineer was battered to a pulp and injected with an unknown poison. I want the perpetrators and I want to know what they've done to my crew."</P>
<P>"This is all very alarming, Captain. Are you sure that you're facts are correct?"</P>
<P>"Let me be properly understood, First Minister," Janeway was cold, hard and implacable. "A member of my crew is dying because of the actions of your people. The male called Nordik is responsible. You better get me the antidote." She almost spat the words out.</P>
<P>"Allow me to investigate the matter," he offered, chastened.</P>
<P>"You have 5 minutes. Close the channel."</P>
<I><P>What if there is no antidote?</P>
</I>
<P>Janeway felt sick at the thought, but she quelled it. Be positive, be positive.</P>
<P>Exactly 3 minutes and 54 seconds later, the first Minister reappeared.</P>
<P>He shrugged his shoulders in a manner Janeway found insultingly casual, considering the circumstances.</P>
<P>"Captain, what can I say. Affairs of the heart and recruitment were never meant to go hand in hand."</P>
<P>"What the hell are you talking about? Whose recruitment?" Janeway was baffled, then she understood.</P>
<P>"You were trying to forcibly enslave my staff. That's how you maintain all your borrowed technology. That explains why so many aliens mate with your people. You capture and enslave foreign species."</P>
<P>"Our recruitment policies are an internal affair, Captain Janeway," he replied pompously.</P>
<P>"Tell me how to save her," she ground out.</P>
<P>"Primary Technician Nordik, selected your engineer to be bound to him. She accepted, but then reneged at the time of the ceremony. Nordik was within his rights to express his displeasure."</P>
<P>"What have you done to my officer?" she roared, at the end of her tether.</P>
<P>"You must to return her to the homeworld. There is no antidote. Her body chemistry is being resequenced to match the biorhythms of her bound partner, Nordik. She must be with him or she will die with the week.</P>
<P>"You expect me to give her to you?" Janeway was incredulous.</P>
<P>"The decision is yours, Captain. If you choose to keep her, she will die." The First Minister yawned. "Let me know when you have prepared her for transport. Oh and Captain, you will find that your transporters will no longer work. Our magnomemetic field has been updated with your ship configurations. You will not be able to penetrate it."</P>
<P>Janeway gestured to Harry to close the channel. She felt ill. "Try and locate this Nordik person, see if you hail him or beam to the brig, anything."</P>
<P>"Aye, Ma'am." Harry work feverishly.</P>
<P>"Captain, it would appear that the First Minister is telling the truth. Our sensors can no longer penetrate the magnomemetic field. Rather than being a structure left by an alien technology, as they told us, it would appear to be a device that the Kalahari are able to manipulate." Tuvok was dispassionate as he reported his findings.</P>
<P>Janeway pinched the bridge of her nose, this was getting from bad to worse.</P>
<P>"There is no way that I'm giving her to them," she stated the obvious.</P>
<P>"Captain, there no response, not from anywhere. It's as if the planet doesn't even exist." Harry was regretful. He was also worried sick about his friend in sickbay.</P>
<P>Before she could respond, the doctor hailed the bridge.</P>
<P>"Go ahead, doctor," her heart sank.</P>
<P>"You'd better come to sickbay, Captain."</P>
<P>"I'm on my way."</P>
<P>When Janeway reached sickbay, she found Seven standing beside the biobed, leaning over the unconscious Klingon, stroking her hair and whispering softly to her.</P>
<P>Tom was monitoring the medical console and the doctor was in his office.</P>
<P>"What's the news doctor?"</P>
<P>"She came through the surgery, but the poison in her bloodstream has made matters worse." He showed the Captain a data padd with his findings.</P>
<P>"I take it you got no joy from the Kalahari?"</P>
<P>She shook her head.</P>
<P>"It seems that the poison, rather than affecting the tissue cells, it is migrating to her brain stem and forming a mass of some type."</P>
<P>"Doctor, I don't understand."</P>
<P>"It's causing a tumour to form in B'Elanna's brain. That's the only effect that it's having on her, for now. She has lapsed into a coma because of the pressure on her brain, but, and here's the good news, I may be able to save her."</P>
<P>Janeway looked up sharply at that.</P>
<P>"I am monitoring the rate of growth of the tumour, if it doesn't exceed 12.79mm by 14.39mm, I'll be able to operate to remove it. But there are many variables," he added before the Captain got too excited.</P>
<P>"After all that her body's been through, there's no telling whether she will be strong enough to withstand the brain surgery. It will be a delicate and painstaking procedure. No to mention, lengthy."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna's strong and courageous, she'll fight all the way." Janeway affirmed</P>
<P>"And then there's the added bonus of the somewhat erratic nature of the Klingon physiology," the doctor continued without missing a beat. "It may decide to simply shut down and deal with the problem in it's own way. If that happens, all I can do is make her comfortable and hope for the best. If I try to countermand her body's own instructions, I may do incalculable damage."</P>
<P>The Captain nodded and looked out of the doctor's office at Seven, her position had not changed, but she was a deathly pale and still covered in B'Elanna's blood.</P>
<P>"How's Seven doing?"</P>
<P>"A little better, now that she's got something to focus on. Her nanoprobes managed to remove the paralysing agents from her bloodstream and they've done no permanent damage to her systems. But she is in shock and needs to sleep. Perhaps you could help with that, Captain?"</P>
<P>Janeway shook her head decisively, "Do what you can for Seven here, Doctor. She needs to be with B'Elanna. At least for now."</P>
<P>He nodded. " I had no idea that they had got so close."</P>
<P>"They mean the world to each other," she said sadly. Her heart ached for the pain that she knew Seven must be going through.</P>
<P>"Keep me informed." She instructed as she left the Doctor.</P>
<P>Janeway walked over to the biobed and stood at the foot, not wanting to intrude.</P>
<P>Seven looked up at her, her face pale and streaked with fresh tears.</P>
<P>"Has the Doctor informed you?"</P>
<P>Janeway nodded.</P>
<P>"Has the Kalahari animal that did this been detained yet?" There was venom in her tone, even though her voice was low.</P>
<P>"We're working on it, Seven. You just focus on B'Elanna now. She needs you."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and turned back to the face of her love.</P>
<P>Janeway realised that Seven was humming very softly to B'Elanna. </P>

<I><P>Don't give up B'Elanna, please don't give up.</I> Janeway blinked the tears from her eyes as she walked away.</P>

<hr>

<P>It had been eight days since the incident on the Kalahari homeworld.</P>
<P>B'Elanna remained in coma and Seven remained by her side.</P>
<P> Janeway had tried every method she knew how including armed confrontation with the Kalahari, but it had all been to no avail. Voyager no longer had the ability to communicate with or transport to the planet.</P>
<P>A heated and unpleasant debate had taken place in the conference room over the best line of action. </P>
<P>Tuvok had advocated a retreat, as they were accomplishing nothing by remaining in orbit round the planet. They were expending vital resources in trying to come up with a means of making the Kalahari pay for their actions. </P>
<P>"So you suggest we just tuck our tail between our legs and run for cover, is that it Tuvok?" Tom was bitter.</P>
<P>"Fighting with an opponent who does not respond is emotional and counter productive, Mr Paris. Lieutenant Torres would be better served if we concentrated our efforts in finding a cure for her condition." </P>
<P>"Her condition! She's in that condition because of those bastards, are you so caught up in logic that you don't see that?" Tom burst out.</P>
<P>"As you were, Lieutenant." Janeway snapped. She sympathised with the helmsman, but dissent in the ranks was the last thing she needed right now.</P>
<P>"I have to agree with Tuvok," Chakotay spoke quietly. </P>
<P>He had known B'Elanna the longest and for the first time he was scared that she might not come back. He had prayed to his ancestors, that they guide her back the warm embrace of those that loved her. He didn't care that it was selfish and that the spirit world had the right to claim her. He knew, perhaps better than most, that B'Elanna was the life force of the ship. She helped to keep it going in more ways than one. If she died ...</P>
<P>"We are sitting ducks out here. We have no way of telling if the Kalahari have powerful friends on their way to vapourise us. We need to be working with the Doctor."</P>
<P>Janeway sighed deeply, in her heart she wanted to take B'Elanna's Bat'leth, beam down to the planet and hack this Nordik creature into a thousand twitching and bloody lumps. She wanted to hear him scream and beg in mortal agony</P>
<P>But she needed to be ruled by her head. She had a responsibility to her entire crew. They had to leave, whether she liked it or not.</P>
<P>Tom was furious at Chakotay. "I expected more from you, she gave up everything for you ..."</P>
<P>"Don't let me tell you again, Tom." Her voice was lethal.</P>
<P>Tom sank back in his seat, dejected. He was clearly hurting.</P>
<P>"This is hard on all of us, but we're Starfleet Officers, we have to be objective. Or at least I do," her voice gentled.</P>
<P>She sighed and made her decision. </P>
<P>"There is nothing more to be gained by staying. We've explored every available option of trying to detain the animal responsible or to persuade the Kalahari to help us with a cure. We've failed. It's time to leave. </P>
<P>The words left a bitter taste in her mouth.</P>

<P>Tom and Harry sat in the mess hall, eating, both occupied by their thoughts. It had been over two weeks now and there had been no change in B'Elanna's condition. </P>
<P>"So, have you seen Seven recently?" Harry asked.</P>
<P>"Only when I visited sickbay. The doc had to force her out last week and give her strict visiting times because she wasn't eating, sleeping, nothing. It's was only when poor Icheb promised to keep watch over B'Elanna that kind of brought Seven back."</P>
<P>"The Captain's put her in charge of engineering," Tom went on, pushing his meal away. "It gives her something to focus on and besides she's good at it."</P>
<P>"Right." Harry nodded. " That's good.  Does the doc say anything new?"</P>
<P>"Just monitoring the tumour. Wait and see."</P>
<P>"The waiting's driving me mad." Harry burst out</P>
<P>"You and me both, buddy."</P>

<hr>

<P>"Doctor to the bridge."</P>
<P>"Go ahead, Doctor</P>

<P>"I need you to come to come to sickbay immediately," the Doctor sounded urgent.</P>
<P>"Has something gone wrong with the surgery?" Janeway jumped out of her chair, already on her way.</P>
<P>"Not exactly, but there has been a development. Hurry, I haven't much time."</P>
<P>"On my way."</P>
<P>As she approached sickbay, Seven was running from the opposite direction. She had been ordered away from sickbay until after the operation.</P>
<P>"What is it? What has happened?" she asked desperately.</P>
<P>Janeway shook her head, indicating her ignorance. Seven looked ill. Over the past 3 weeks she had barely eaten or rested. Only the threat of sedation had forced her to regenerate every so often. Janeway had found out that Seven could no longer sleep, knowing that B'Elanna was in mortal danger. The work that she did, keeping the engines running smoothly, had saved her sanity. It allowed her to be close to B'Elanna.</P>
<P>The doctor was in his surgical scrubs, in his office and the biobed with B'Elanna had been screened off.</P>
<P>"I need you both to sit down," he invited grimly.</P>
<P>"I prefer to stand." The reply was simultaneous from both women.</P>
<P>"Is she dead?" Seven was composed but her voice sounded strangled.</P>
<P>"No, I've started the procedure and I am certain that she will make a full recovery. However, there are some complications, which is why I've asked both of you here."</P>
<P>He took a deep breath and paced the small office.</P>
<P>"As I indicated the toxins migrated to B'Elanna's brain stem and form a large transfused myanoma. I have already successfully extracted that tumour. What I didn't detect was a secondary, smaller tumour lodged in her neural cortex ..."</P>
<P>"Can you get it out?" the Captain was anxious.</P>
<P>"Yes, but ..."</P>
<P>"But, what ?" she interrupted impatiently.</P>
<P>"In Klingons, the neural cortex controls memory function." Seven recited the facts calmly, but she had gone pale. She knew what the doctor was about to say.</P>
<P>The doctor nodded sadly." She will loose anything from 6 months to 2 years of her memory. There is nothing I can do to prevent it or to preserve those memories ..."</P>
<P>"Will she recover?" Seven asked the words softly.</P>
<P>"Yes, but ..."</P>
<P>"There are no buts, you must do everything to save B'Elanna's life. Other considerations are irrelevant."</P>
<P>The doctor nodded gravely and returned to his patient.</P>
<P>Janeway was in shock. She looked at the stony-faced borg and wondered what she was thinking.</P>
<P>"Seven, I'm no psychiatrist, but you do understand ..."</P>
<P>"That unless she remembers unaided, I will never be able to tell B'Elanna of our feelings for each other." Seven realised that her voice sounded strange and there was a rushing in her ears.</P>
<P>Her world was falling apart. The pain and fear of assimilation was nothing to the thought of B'Elanna being alive in the world and not loving her.</P>
<P>"But she will live," she said the words out loud to comfort herself. "She will live."</P>
<P>" She may even think that she's still married to Tom. Seven, what will you do? How will you cope?"</P>
<P> Seven drew an invisible mantle of protection around her and drew herself up straight. It was the cloak she wore in the days before friendship and love opened up her heart and made her whole.</P>
<P>"I will adapt."</P>

<P>"Captain, please report to sickbay."</P>
<P>It had been a few days since the brain surgery and even though the doctor declared it a success, B'Elanna had yet to regain consciousness. The EMH attributed this to the swelling around the brain, he predicted that once the swelling went down, she would come out of her coma.</P>
<P>He also had appraised them of what to expect. B'Elanna's memory would undoubtedly be affected, most likely her most recent memories. It would take at least a couple of day's evaluation and observation to decide whether she had lost entire blocks of memory or merely gaps. It would also take time to determine whether any or all of the memory would return. The doctor thought that it was too dangerous to try and stimulate her memories to return. He wanted her to heal properly before considering it an option.</P>
<P>When the Captain got to Sickbay she found Seven at B'Elanna's side as she had been for most of the preceding month. Janeway went into the doctor's office to allow her some privacy.</P>
<P>"Doctor?"</P>
<P>"I called Seven to tell her that B'Elanna was near consciousness and that she could be here when she wakes up, just out of sight or something."</P>
<P>"That's very compassionate of you, Doctor." Janeway smiled at the hologram.</P>
<P>"I'll give her another few minutes."</P>
<P>Seven was stroking B'Elanna's hair and whispering to her softly.</P>
<P>"I do not know what will happen to us, it is possibly that you will never regain your memories. But I will not give up on you, B'Elanna. I will not give up on us. You loved me once, I know that you will love me again." She leant closer and placed a soft gentle kiss on the warm lips of the slumbering Klingon.  </P>
<P>She straightened and decided that it would be better if she left sickbay altogether, at this moment, she didn't trust herself not to break down completely, the minute she heard B'Elanna's voice. There would be time enough later.</P>
<P>With one final lingering glance, Seven strode out of sickbay.</P>
<P>Janeway and the Doctor exchanged a look but made no comment, secretly the doctor was relieved, there were too many variables as it was, he really didn't need the complication of an hysterical Borg on his hands as well.</P>
<P>He used a mild stimulant to bring B'Elanna to full consciousness.</P>
<P>They both watched anxiously as B'Elanna slowly opened her eyes and blinked groggily for a few minutes. As soon as she focused on where she was, B'Elanna immediately tried to sit up and speak.</P>
<P>"Whoa, slow down, take it easy, B'Elanna."</P>
<P>"Captain? What am I doing here? What's happened?"</P>
<P>"You were seriously injured on an away mission. How are you feeling?"</P>
<P>"My head hurts like hell and I ache all over. What happened to me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna's voice was weak and even speaking for a few moments had clearly exhausted her.</P>
<P>The Doctor intervened.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, what's the last thing you remember?" He was busily monitoring all her vitals.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sank back on the bed and closed her eyes.</P>
<P>"I was .... I was monitoring the warp core. The Xenons were attacking us for crossing their space." She shot upright as a thought occurred to her, but cried out in agony, clutching her head in both hands.</P>
<P>"The warp core ... I didn't lose it did I?" she groaned out.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna you've got to take it easy. The warp core is fine," Janeway smiled grimly. The attack by the Xenons had taken place over 10 months ago.</P>
<P>"But there was no away mission. How could I have been hurt on an away mission. When did this happen, who was I with?" she forced herself upright again.</P>
<P>"Why can't I remember?"</P>
<P>"I'll say this for her, she catches on fast," the Doctor whispered to Janeway.</P>
<P>The doctor had briefed her on this eventuality, keep it short and simple.</P>
<P>"That attack was some months ago, B'Elanna. You and Seven were working with a race called the Kalahari when you were attacked. The Doctor had to perform brain surgery. That's why you can't remember."</P>
<P>B'Elanna lay back down and eyed the Captain closely.</P>
<P>"How's Seven? Was she injured as well?"</P>
<P>"A little, but she's fine."</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes, trying to take in all the information. They snapped open as another thought occurred to her.</P>
<P>"Exactly how long have I been here?"</P>
<P>"A month." The doctor stated blithely.</P>
<P>"A MONTH!" B'Elanna shrieked and then winced at the pain.</P>
<P>"Who's been taking care on my engines?" She glared at the Captain as she asked the question.</P>
<P>"Please don't tell me you let Seven run loose in engineering?" she asked without waiting for an answer.</P>
<P>At Janeway's cautious nod, B'Elanna moaned out loud.</P>
<P>"Aww, Captain. You know she drives me nuts. I'll never find anything once I get back."</P>
<P>"Well, Lieutenant, I wouldn't worry about that for a while. You'll be in sick bay for quite a while yet. We'll have time to get reacquainted." </P>
<P>B'Elanna looked less than pleased at the prospect.</P>
<P>"Captain ...?"</P>
<P>"As long as the Doctor says, B'Elanna. And that's an order." She squeezed one of her engineer's hands. "We nearly lost you this time, I'm glad to have you back."</P>

<hr>

<P>Seven was busy supervising the maintenance sweep and taking more than a fair portion of the workload herself when the workstation she was on flashed, indicating an incoming message. She raised her ocular implant. Why didn't the individual simply hail her using their combadge?</P>
<P>"Hey, Seven. Guess who?"</P>
<P>Her throat went dry at the sight of B'Elanna on the tiny monitor. It had been a few days since B'Elanna had regained consciousness and although Seven had visited B'Elanna while she was asleep and with the other crew, this was the first time that they had spoken</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, how may I be of assistance?"</P>
<P>"Listen, Seven you've got to help me. I'm going out of my mind here in sickbay." B'Elanna looked carefully at Seven as she said the last bit.</P>
<P>"I don't mean literally, ok?"</P>
<P>Seven allowed herself a small smile, it hurt so much to see B'Elanna and not be able to tell her how much she loved her. But she was overjoyed that the strong-willed Klingon was regaining her strength.</P>
<P>"I take it that your lack of occupation in sickbay is making you .....discontent." Seven searched for the least contentious word.</P>
<P>"No, Seven, I'm bored out of my frigging mind." B'Elanna corrected succinctly.</P>
<P>"Look, Harry let it slip that you guys in engineering are conducting a maintenance sweep and I'm not going to have a go at you for running it 6 weeks early, but I would like to be involved."</P>
<P>"How?"</P>
<P>"We ...ll, I was kind of hoping that you could swing by after your shift with some of the updates."</P>
<P>Seven looked closely at B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, where is the Doctor?"</P>
<P>"I took him off-line for a few minutes. C'mon, Seven. Help me out here. If the doctor catches me out of bed, I'll never hear the end of it."</P>
<P>"The doctor has clearly determined that you are not yet fit to leave sickbay, let alone work." Seven had no intention of jeopardising B'Elanna's full return to fitness.</P>
<P>"Oh, Seven, please. I promise that all I'll do is look. You can stay with me to make sure that I don't make too many recommendations. I really need this."</P>
<P>The minute that B'Elanna pleaded, Seven felt herself weaken. She knew that she could deny B'Elanna nothing.</P>
<P>"Look at it this way," B'Elanna negotiated, not realising that she had Seven wrapped around her little finger." If you show me the updates and the schedules, I'll be able to steer you in the right direction and stuff. It'll save me ripping your head off when I get back and find that you did it all wrong." She waggled her eyebrows comically. "I'll be your best friend," B'Elanna wheedled like a small child after a favourite toy.</P>
<P>"I will comply."</P>
<P>"Thanks, Seven. I owe you one. See you later." The console winked off, ending the transmission.</P>
<P>Seven stood and stared at the black screen. She trailed her fingertips across the place that her loves' face had been.</P>
<P>"You are my best friend," she whispered softly. "You always will be."</P>

<hr>

<P>"Seven, the bottom line is that I want you to leave."</P>
<P>"I will not comply."</P>
<P>"Haven't you work in Astrometrics?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>There was a stand-off of sorts. At least B'Elanna thought it was a stand-off, she wanted the Borg out of her precious engineering. And the Borg wasn't budging.</P>
<I><P>B'Elanna why don't you just grow up a little</I>, she thought to herself as she considered the silent drone.</P>
<I>
<P>You know damn well, she's only trying to help. You're not strong enough to carry the load on your own, at least not yet. And you have to admit, she's done a great job of managing without you over the last month.</P>
</I>
<P>B'Elanna knew that that she was feeling a little insecure that was all. But she had been taking it out on Seven all shift long. She had finally been given the all clear to return to work and she had been excited and happy to get back to her precious engines, but when she got here, Seven wouldn't let her do anything. The ex-drone had been dogging her footsteps everywhere and would allow the Klingon the chance to get her hands dirty.</P>
<P>She tried for a compromise.</P>
<P>"Look, Seven. I remember that I said that I wanted to be a better friend and colleague to you, but to be honest, I don't remember how that worked out. So I have to start all over again with you. OK?"</P>
<P>Seven had no idea where this was headed but nodded anyway.</P>
<P>"I promise not to antagonise you and you promise not to piss me off either. Deal?"</P>
<P>"Deal." Seven raised her ocular implant at the bargain. "It was not my intention to ...piss you off, Lieutenant. I only wanted to help. I will leave as you requested."</P>
<P>B'Elanna felt like the biggest bitch alive, she had clearly heard the hurt in Seven's voice. She jogged up to the departing drone and grabbed her by the arm.</P>
<P>"Seven, wait up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You've been a great help. You've been wonderful. You helped me keep my sanity by sneaking those reports, all the time I was in sick bay, you kept me company. You even put up with me when I was in pain and cranky. And the first chance it get, I revert to being a Klingon ass."</P>
<P>She looked deep into those blue eyes.</P>
<P>"I do appreciate what you've done for me. I know I don't deserve it, but ..thank you."</P>
<P>Seven put her hand over the smaller brown one still holding on to her arm.</P>
<P>"May I still continue to offer my help or assistance, anything that you require?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna was slightly distracted by the warmth of Seven's hand over hers. It felt ... nice.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Of course, Seven. Thank you."</P>

<P>Over the course of the next week or so, B'Elanna got fully back into the swing of things and there was no real need for Seven to spend anytime in engineering.</P>
<P>She took in badly, not knowing how to break the impasse that she appeared to be at. She needed to be close to B'Elanna but until a joint project came their way she had to settle for chance meetings in the mess hall or during the staff meetings. She tried to engage B'Elanna in conversation, but so far it had got her nowhere.</P>

<P>The senior crew filed out of the conference room, but B'Elanna remained in her seat.</P>
<P>"Is there something I can help you with, B'Elanna?" Janeway smiled at the Klingon as she entered the Captain's ready room.</P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her hands together. She was a little nervous.</P>
<P>"Are you well? Settled back into the swing of things?" Janeway was proud at the speed with which B'Elanna recovered and returned to work.</P>
<P>"It's about Seven, actually." B'Elanna started, not exactly sure what she wanted to say.</P>
<P>Janeway got up and went to the replicator to hide her expression.</P>
<I><P>Please don't tell me someone has told her.</I> Janeway shrank from the thought, knowing the damage it could do to both of the women.</P>
<P>"Oh?" she invited her to sit.</P>
<P>"Is Seven, ill or something?" B'Elanna jumped up almost as soon as she sat down, clearly agitated.</P>
<P>"She's pale all the time, she lost so much weight, I never see her eating. What's wrong with her?"</P>
<P>"The doctor hasn't reported anything to me," Janeway was playing for time. As much as she wanted to tell B'Elanna that Seven was suffering from a broken heart, she knew that she couldn't.</P>
<P>"I mean, you must have noticed something, Captain. And she's polite to me, even helpful. Which is really weird." B'Elanna shook her head in bemusement.</P>
<P>Janeway smiled at that.</P>
<P>"To be honest, Captain, I'm a little worried about her." B'Elanna stopped pacing the office and faced Janeway, admitting her fears.</P>
<P>"There's is nothing physically wrong with Seven." The Captain affirmed. "Maybe you should talk to her." </P>
<P>B'Elanna was thinking hard and didn't hear the Captain.</P>
<P>"You know, I was thinking, perhaps she's a little lonely, finding it difficult to adjust to having private quarters instead of the alcove. Maybe, I'll go talk to her."</P>
<P>"I think that's a good idea, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>As the Klingon left the ready room, she missed the compassionate smile on the face of her Captain.</P>
<P>Perhaps things would work out after all.</P>

<P>As B'Elanna made her way to Astrometrics, where she knew Seven to be, she wondered if Borgs suffered from depression. She had wanted to take the ex-drone a gift but couldn't think of anything suitable, so she decided to invite Seven to her own quarters for dinner that evening.</P>
<P>When she entered Astrometrics, at first she didn't see Seven and then spied her sitting on the steps to the platform, her knees drawn up to her chest and her arms wrapped around them. He face was resting on her knees and B'Elanna could hear her crying softly.</P>
<P>She ran to her in shock.</P>
<P>"Oh my God, Seven are you alright? Are you hurt?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna dropped to her knees beside the drone and put her hand on Seven's shoulder.</P>
<P>There was no reply. She shook the shoulder, now genuinely frightened.</P>
<P>"Seven, talk to me. Tell me what's wrong."</P>
<P>"I do not require your assistance at this time, Lieutenant Torres," Her voice was muffled.</P>
<P>"The hell you don't," B'Elanna growled. "I'm not leaving you like this, so you might as well tell me. What is it?"</P>
<P>But her insistence only made Seven sob all the more. B'Elanna felt helpless just kneeling there, so she offered what comfort she could by taking Seven up in her arms and rocking her gently.</P>
<P>Seven turned her face into B'Elanna's neck and allowed the tears to fall. She knew that she should try and regain some control over her emotions, but things had just got a little too much for her today. And having B'Elanna being so concerned and compassionate made her weep all the more. She held on tightly to B'Elanna, grateful for the nearness.</P>
<P>B'Elanna couldn't begin to think of what had caused Seven to break down so, but it broke her heart and she held her tightly. </P>
<P>"Hey, come on now. Hush, hush. It's ok, Seven, it's ok," she crooned. Instinctively she stroked the back of Seven's neck, somehow knowing that it would soothe the distressed woman.</P>
<P>A distracted thought came to her <I>How in the world do I know that?</I> but was gone in a second. </P>
<P>Seven took a few shuddering breaths as her tears gradually dried up. She hiccuped a little and quietened but made no move to move from B'Elanna's arms.</P>
<I>
<P>I know that this is not real. I know that she is only offering me comfort.</I> </P>
<P>After a long time, B'Elanna gradually eased Seven away from her and looked deeply into her tearwashed blue eyes.</P>
<P>"Seven, can you tell me what's wrong?" She asked the question gently, her hands on either side of Seven's face. Her thumbs brushed away the tears that still lingered on Seven's cheeks.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seven swallowed hard at the gesture, forcing the tears down and mutely shook her head.</P>
<P>"Would you like me to get the Captain for you? Or maybe the doctor? Tell me what you need."</P>
<P>Seven dropped her eyes to hide her expression; all that she ever needed or wanted was right here.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Lieutenant, for your kindness and ..." Seven started to tear up again.</P>
<P>"Hey, hey enough with the tears already."  B'Elanna was still gently stroking Seven's face, completely unaware of her actions.</P>
<P>"I came here to invite you to dinner. I know that it might be lonely in your quarters with only Icheb for company, so I thought that you might like to spend the evening with me. Icheb is learning some bad habits off Tom and Harry tonight so you don't need to worry about him."</P>
<P>B'Elanna knew how proud the borg could be and was prepared to argue the case, she wasn't leaving Seven alone in this condition.</P>
<P>Seven looked up at B'Elanna and nodded. She was grateful to spend anytime with B'Elanna under any circumstances, just to be close to her, to hear the sound of her voice.</P>
<P>When they got to B'Elanna's quarters, she took off her jacket and boots and flung them through the open doorway to her bedroom.</P>
<P>"So, Seven, what would you like to eat?"</P>
<P>"I am happy to allow you to decide our meal." Seven tried not to stare but she could not help herself. Her eyes hungrily followed the Klingon around the room, familiarising herself with every sinew and toned muscle in the woman's arms.   </P>
<P>"You know what? I fancy something nice and spicy. How about an Indian meal?"</P>
<P>"That would be acceptable." Seven instinctively began setting the table as she had done so many times before.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was surprised at the ex-drones actions, but put it down to Borg efficiency.</P>
<P>During the meal, B'Elanna was determined to cheer Seven up and tried to amuse her by telling silly stories about the Doctor.</P>
<P>When they finished eating B'Elanna got up and threw herself onto the couch, sighing happily.</P>
<P>"Come on, sit over here for a while." She invited.</P>
<P>Seven was more concerned with the dishes.</P>
<P>"It will take approximately 8 minutes and 24 seconds to clear the dining area. Once that task is complete, I will join you."</P>
<P>"You always insist on doing the dishes straight away. Why is that? You got some phobia ...." B'Elanna's teasing stopped abruptly.</P>
<P>Seven realised what B'Elanna had said and looked silently at the bemused engineer.</P>
<P>"I said always. I said you ALWAYS insist on doing the dishes." She ran her hands through her hair, frowning hard.</P>
<P>Seven held her breath. She didn't know what to do or say. </P>
<P>"I remember that, just that. Nothing else." She looked up at the silent Seven.</P>
<P>"How do I know that?  I mean, the thought just popped into my head. I've been going nuts, trying to remember the simplest of things missing from the last 10 months of my memory and nothing." She got up and paced the room. "And now, out of the blue, you and doing the dishes." She flashed a huge grin at Seven. "You must be my lucky charm."</P>
<P>Seven sighed in relief. That had gone well. "If you say so, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>They tidied up in silence for a few moments and B'Elanna asked casually,</P>
<P>"So how many times have I had you over for dinner?"</P>
<P>"Lieutenant ?"</P>
<P>"You know you can call me B'Elanna. How many times have you been over? I mean, if I remember that you always insist on tidying up, then it stands to reason that you must have been here quiet a few times. I should have realised that when you started laying the table."</P>
<P>Seven was stuck. The doctor had insisted that B'Elanna memories should be allowed to return unaided. He felt that she was too fragile, psychologically, at this point, to handle the overwhelming emotions that would accompany learning of her deep friendship and eventual love for someone she had previously clearly despised. Neither Seven, nor the Captain completely agreed with him, but they all agreed that the mind was a delicate organ and shouldn't be overtaxed.</P>
<P>She had visited B'Elanna's quartered almost every week in the preceding 10 months. She would not tell the truth.</P>
<P>"You have invited me to an evening meal on several occasions, Lieutenant," she compromised, not telling a complete lie.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sat down again and considered the tall, blond woman. </P>
<P>"You know, Seven, a couple of things have occurred to me. While we sat here eating and chatting, I knew that you were enjoying yourself, I knew that you found my stories about the doctor amusing, I knew that you found the starter dish too spicy, even though you said that it was fine." She got up from her seat and walked round to where Seven was standing and pulled her to the couch where they both sat down</P>
<P>"I don't know how, but, I can read your expressions, your emotions, it's almost as if I know what you're feeling, but I know that's dumb." She looked at Seven very closely.</P>
<P>"During the months that are missing, I got to know you better, didn't I? That's the only way I can explain why I know these things about you. Did we become friends, Seven?"</P>
<P>"We became friends, B'Elanna," Seven held her breath, wanting, hoping that the rest would come.</P>
<P>"But why didn't you tell me?" </P>
<P>Seven detected the very slight tone of hurt in the question and her heart burned. She haltingly explained the doctor's theory and B'Elanna laughed.</P>
<P>"I guess he's right about that one. I might have gone into cardiac arrest if someone told me that we were pals." She leaned over and squeezed one of Seven's hands for a moment.</P>
<P>"I'm glad that we are friends," she said shyly.</P>
<P>"So am I, B'Elanna."</P>
<P>The evening ended on a high as far as Seven was concerned. She had spent a further hour with B'Elanna chatting about less contentious issues than B'Elanna's memory. Back in her quarters, she checked on Icheb and then retired to her own room. She looked at the painting of the two larks ascending and smiled.</P>

<P>B'Elanna eyed the Doctor impatiently. She hated being in sickbay when all she had to do was work on the EMH's holo-emitters. She liked it even less as a patient.</P>
<P>"You are clearly not taking your rehabilitation seriously, Lieutenant," the doctor commented as he scanned her.</P>
<P>"I distinctly recall instructing you to work for no more than 6 hours at any one stretch and to have at least 10 hours sleep every night."</P>
<P>"Doctor, be serious, even Naomi doesn't get that much sleep." B'Elanna folded her arms obstinately.</P>
<P>"And Naomi Wildman isn't recovering from major brain surgery," the doctor shot back. He made a few notations on his padd and tut tutted a few times. "I can also tell that you've been skipping meals as well."</P>
<P>"Quit fussing, I'm fine." B'Elanna burst out.</P>
<P>"Here, take this." The Doctor handed her a data padd.</P>
<P>"What's this?" B'Elanna looked at it curiously.</P>
<P>"It's a detailed regiment that I expect you to follow over the next two weeks. There is a breakdown of suggested exercises and activities that aren't too strenuous and some tasks that I'd like you to avoid. We'll review it ...."</P>
<P>"You've got to be kidding, there's no way I'm going to spend the next two weeks doing this stuff."</P>
<P>"Fine. If you're not willing to take my recommendations then I'll simply have you confined to sickbay for the next two weeks instead. How's that sound?"</P>
<P>The bristling engineer glared at him.</P>
<P>"Hmm, I thought not. This is for your own good and if you follow it to the letter, it'll only be for a short while."</P>
<P>She gave him a sour smile as she took a closer look at his instructions. </P>
<P>"Are we done now?"</P>
<P>"Not quite. Just a few more test." He shone a light into her pupils judging their reaction.</P>
<P>"Any nausea?"</P>
<P>"None."</P>
<P>"Headaches?"</P>
<P>"Apart from you?" she rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>The hologram straightened, waiting for an answer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sighed, "No headaches."</P>
<P>"Dizziness, disorientation?"</P>
<P>"No, doctor, none of those things." </P>
<P>"Excellent," the Doctor beamed. "I have to admit, despite your flagrant disregard of my instructions, you are well on the road to full recovery."</P>
<P>He began to tidy up. "There have been no bouts of Aphasia, no sleepwalking, no violent moods swings. Not that anyone would really know the difference with you, Lieutenant." He blithely ignored the glare that she aimed at him as he finished his check up.</P>
<P>"When am I going to get my memories back?"</P>
<P>"When they're ready, don't push it. It's possible they'll come back piecemeal. And stay away from Tuvok. This is no time to be dabbling in Vulcan healing techniques."</P>
<P>"Can I go now?" She was severely irritated.</P>
<P>The Doctor ALWAYS pushed her to the limit.</P>
<P>"I'll see you bright and early this time next week, Lieutenant. And don't forget, we'll spend lots of time together if you don't stick to that regimen."</P>
<P>B'Elanna swore quietly under her breath as she walked away.</P>
<P>"Oh, Lieutenant Torres," the doc called her back.</P>
<P> She turned and raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"It's 1600hrs. You're officially off duty until 1000 tomorrow. Have a nice evening."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's shoulders slumped as she left sickbay. What the hell was she supposed to do with her time?</P>
<P>She bumped into Naomi Wildman and smiled at the child who was skipping happily along the corridors.</P>
<P>"Hi, Lieutenant," the child chirped happily</P>
<P>"Hey Naomi, where are you off to?"</P>
<P>"Seven's promised to play kadiskot with me once she gets off duty. She said I could wait for her at her quarters. D'you want to play? Seven's really good."</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at the schedule the doctored had given her. He recommended an hour of painting watercolours followed by a nap. He had to be kidding.</P>
<P>"Sure why not?" She took the child's hand and walked towards Seven's quarters.</P>

<hr>

<P>The senior crew was sat around the conference table as usual discussing ship's affairs. For the first time in ages, it seemed, the picture was rosy. Or as rosy as it could be stuck 60 million light years away from home, in a distant part of the galaxy, with no friends ....(bring out the violins!)</P>
<P>Janeway and Chakotay were waxing lyrically over some new spatial phenomena that was worth investigating. For once, it was very close to their position and Voyager wouldn't lose any precious resources chasing this spatial rift.</P>
<P>Janeway was going through the department heads to make sure the ship and it's crew would be able to withstand the temporal eddies that might exist closer to the phenomena.</P>
<P>"According to Starfleet records a similar phenomena was discovered in the Gamma Quadrant by the crew of the USS Defiant," Seven reported.</P>
<P>"The Defiant?" Janeway turned to face the Borg. "That was Benjamin Sisko's command."</P>
<P>"Did you know him, Captain?" Chakotay asked curiously.</P>
<P>"Only by reputation. Good Captain, with a difficult job. Carry on, Seven."</P>
<P>"The Defiant found that these anomalies disguised a planet that existed out of phase with normal time. The planet, known as Meridian returned to our normal space and time only once every 60 years. There is a 79.8% probability that the spatial eddies that we have observed mask a similar planet."</P>
<P>"You know Captain, I'm getting to be a little wary of planets that are masked by one type of natural cloud or something," B'Elanna commented idly.</P>
<P>Janeway and Seven looked at her sharply, but she didn't notice.</P>
<P>"I mean the last time the ship needed a overhaul we wound up with the Kalahari and that bastard Nordik ..."</P>
<P>The room went very quiet.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sat very still and looked at her hands as they rested on the polished wood of the conference table, they trembled, badly.</P>
<P>She knew that something had happened, something she had just said, but she couldn't put her finger on it, she tried to concentrate, but the noise in her head was too loud. It was too loud.</P>
<P>Her surroundings, her friends, her captain, they seemed to fade away in the intense burning light. It hurt her eyes.</P>
<P>She closed her eyes, but her mind filled with images, flashes of light and sound and vivid, violent and child-like eyes. Her mind filled with the image of those eyes, those eyes and then, pain. So much pain.</P>
<P>Another sound, a noise, it sounded like the Howl of Death, it was filled with pain and anger.</P>
<P>It was coming from her.</P>
<P>Tom, who was closest, clasped her shoulder, trying to comfort, but she flung him away, her eyes unseeing, a trickle of deep red blood running from her nose.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna!" Janeway called to her, trying to bring her engineer back from the brink of agony.</P>
<P>But B'Elanna didn't, couldn't respond. She was caught up in the jaws of memory, re-living every minute of her horrific assault. She crouched in a corner, her arms trying to protect her head from the blows, still howling in pain and anger.</P>
<P>Seven leapt over the table and feel to her knees beside B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, do not be afraid. You are strong. You will overcome this." She said the words quietly, but with a strange kind of confidence. She knew that B'Elanna could withstand almost anything.</P>
<P>B'Elanna focused on the voice and looked at Seven.</P>
<P>"He hurt me. They hurt us. Why?" B'Elanna whispered brokenly. Her eyes rolled back in her head and she collapsed, unconscious.</P>

<hr>

<P>"I've decided to release her back to her quarters, Captain," the Doctor informed.</P>
<P>"Is that wise? She was in a really bad way, practically reliving some of her memories." Janeway felt shivers as she recalled the spine-chilling screams of B'Elanna's agony.</P>
<P>"Well, she regained consciousness after a few moments and seemed aware of her surroundings and what had happened. It appears that only another small fragment of her memory returned, apparently the most traumatic episode."</P>
<P>"And?" Janeway was impatient.</P>
<P>"And, nothing. She's comfortable, I've prescribed a mild sedative to help her sleep. And I've ordered her to visit me when she wakes. She may want to discuss the memory of her brutal beating and the emotions they aroused." He raised his eyebrows meaningfully.</P>
<P>"However, knowing Lieutenant Torres, she may not. We'll just have to wait and see."</P>
<P>"Shouldn't someone be with her? Is she alright on her own?"</P>
<P>"Tom took B'Elanna back to her quarters with instructions to tuck her in. She'll be fine."</P>
<P>Janeway nodded, satisfied.</P>
<P>She knew that all of this must have been pretty hard on Seven and decided to check up on her. She wasn't really surprised to find that the ex-drone working in Astrometrics. Ever since the assault, Seven had buried herself in her work, not being able to take the initiative with B'Elanna. Not able to rekindle the love that they previously shared.</P>
<P>"Captain." Seven acknowledged Janeway as she entered the room.</P>
<P>"I came to find out how you were, Seven," the Captain explained gently.</P>
<P>"I am functioning adequately, Captain," Seven responded calmly.</P>
<P>Janeway made no comment and simply stared at the ex-drone.</P>
<P>"I find myself in a dilemma, I wished to experience the emotions that seemed to come so easily to humans. But now that I have these feelings, I fear that they will overwhelm me. My heart hurts even though I know that my cardiac muscle is undamaged. I have shed more tears than I thought possible and yet, I could still cry each and every time that I look at B'Elanna and know that she sees me as nothing other than a colleague."</P>
<P>"Would you give up that short time you had together, when you experienced all those emotions that you longed for?"</P>
<P>Seven shook her head. She remembered the larks. " No, never. Only with B'Elanna was I ever truly free."</P>
<P>"Then don't regret what you felt for her. Instead try to rekindle it. You don't need to tell her how much you love her, but you could gradually begin to show her, the same way you showed your love to her before."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her Captain and smiled.</P>
<P>"Thank you."</P>

</table>

<P>Seven walked along the quiet corridors towards her quarters, thinking hard about the advice given to her by Janeway. The thought off actively pursuing B'Elanna afresh hadn't really occurred to her. </P>
<P>How could I possibly make B'Elanna love me?  </P>
<P>The fact that B'Elanna needed no encouragement the first time round didn't occur to her. She have to prepare some line of action, factor in all the different variables ...</P>
<P>Seven was deep in thought when the object of her affection appeared round the corner, walking in her direction.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, is something troubling you?" Seven was disturbed.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was wearing a short silky black nightgown and was barefoot and had a blank, vacant expression on her face.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>The engineer walked straight past her without acknowledgement.</P>
<P>For a heart-stopping moment, Seven thought that B'Elanna had somehow been assimilated, she was displaying all of the characteristics of a drone. But common sense kicked in, the Klingon was somnambulating, strange as it sounded.</P>
<P>Seven felt a surge of protectiveness well up as the smaller woman walked towards to turbolift, she wasn't sure what to do, so she followed, tapping her combadge as she entered the turbolift with B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Deck 10."</P>
<P>Her voice sounded normal, Seven thought. And she wants to go to engineering.</P>
<P>"Doctor, I need your advice," she was still watching B'Elanna closely.</P>
<P>"Seven, what is it?" the doctor asked.</P>
<P>"I have just found B'Elanna walking in the corridors on her way to engineering, she appears to be sleepwalking. Should I wake her?"</P>
<P>"NO. Under no circumstances should you wake her. Get a security detail to follow her to make sure she doesn't hurt herself or anyone else. Do you understand?"</P>
<P>"I will escort B'Elanna myself, doctor. Do you have any other instructions?"</P>
<P>"Her subconscious obviously wants her to complete some task or other in engineering, typical compulsive workaholic behaviour," the doctor tutted.</P>
<P>"Once she's done whatever she feels she needs to do, try and direct her back to her quarters. You can talk to her quietly and gently steer her in the right direction, but she must wake naturally, don't try to force her."</P>
<P>"I understand, doctor. I will contact you if I require further assistance. Thank you. Seven out."</P>
<P>Seven watched B'Elanna carefully, but there was no expression on the beautiful engineer's face, no warmth, no laughter, no friendship and no love. The ex-drone was used to seeing all of those emotions on the Klingon's face and this cold, empty stare was somehow frightening.</P>
<P>Seven couldn't help herself. She moved closer to B'Elanna in the turbo lift and gently ran her hand down the Klingon's bare arm. She was surprised when B'Elanna turned towards her at the touch.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>There was still no response but B'Elanna did look up at the sound of Seven's voice and a fleeting look of recognition crossed her face. It didn't wake her but it did allay Seven's fears a little.</P>
<P>They entered to engineering, B'Elanna walking slowly but purposefully, she knew where she was going.</P>
<P>The engineer stopped at the warp core and stared at it for a minute and then walked to a workstation, punching in some calculations. Seven stood close and watched over the shorter woman's shoulder, making sure that B'Elanna didn't eject the warp core or something.</P>
<P>The perfectionist in Seven couldn't help but smile. B'Elanna's subconscious had brought her to engineering to correct a 0.032 variance in the warp nacelles. The engineer was a woman after Seven's own heart. B'Elanna always said that she could work Voyagers engines in her sleep. It appeared that she wasn't joking.</P>
<P>Once the corrections had been made, B'Elanna heaved a sigh and turned round and walked out of main engineering, Seven closely following.</P>
<P>The Borg trailed B'Elanna back to her quarters and decided to follow her in to make sure she went back to bed. The Klingon crawled into her bed and snuggled under the covers, Seven hovering by the bed.</P>
<P>She was shocked when B'Elanna held her hand out and spoke.</P>
<P>"Please stay."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna? Are you awake?" Seven kept her voice low, not wanting to startle her.</P>
<P>"Why won't you stay? Please stay with me." B'Elanna pleaded.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven was puzzled, B'Elanna was still asleep, her eyes open but unfocused.</P>
<P>"I need you to stay, please." B'Elanna was becoming distressed and Seven quickly sat down on the bed beside her, stroking the dark chestnut hair.</P>
<P>"I will stay with you, B'Elanna. I will not leave you."</P>
<P>Her words had the desired effect. B'Elanna sighed happily and lay down on her side, facing the Borg. She fumbled for a moment and managed to grasp Seven's hand, bringing it to her mouth and dropping a small kiss on the open palm. </P>
<P>Seven felt herself tremble at the tender touch, but didn't dare move for fear of breaking the magical spell.</P>
<P>She strained her ears to catch the mumbled words coming from the drowsy Klingon.</P>
<P>"Say you love me. I'm in love with you, Seven, please say you love me too." The words were faint but Seven knew that they were heartfelt. Somewhere, in the chasm of her subconscious, B'Elanna was still deeply in love with Seven.</P>
<P>Seven stretched out beside B'Elanna, gently cupping her cheek and whispered words of love and longing to the woman who possessed her heart and soul.</P>

<P>The next morning there was a good deal of teasing and joking about B'Elanna's little trip to engineering in the dead of night to correct a tiny variance.</P>
<P>B'Elanna only got to hear about it when she reported to sickbay. She had been deep in thought. Somehow remembering fragments of the assault didn't bother her as much this morning as they had the previous night. She was still filled with a bitter rage at what she and Seven had endured, but somehow the night had made things a little better.</P>
<P>B'Elanna blushed as she thought about last night, she quickly looked round to make sure no one noticed her flushed cheeks as she made her way to sickbay.</P>
<P>For some reason, she had been dreaming about Seven, the memory of the dreams was hazy as they often are once, but B'Elanna knew that she felt warm, safe and happy. </P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped dead in her tracks. In her dream, she had felt loved and completely cherished ....by Seven. </P>
<I><P>Of all people</I>. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was perplexed, to say the least. What the sam hill had triggered such a dream? She was beginning to get on quite well with the ex-drone, enjoying her company and dry sense of humour. But this? This was something else. </P>
<P> </P>
<P>As she entered sickbay, Seven was talking to the Doctor and B'Elanna felt herself flushing again at the sight of the tall beautiful woman. Unable to meet her eyes, B'Elanna dropped her gaze to the floor and mumble a greeting at the Borg as she past.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, I trust that you are functioning adequately?" Seven's voice was coolly formal, but B'Elanna still couldn't bring herself to look up and simply nodded.</P>
<P>She thought she detected a hint of a smile in the question, but there was no way she was going to find out staring at the floor. But before she could screw up enough courage, the doors swished closed behind a departing Borg.</P>
<P>"Well, B'Elanna, I trust that you are no worse for wear after your little midnight date." The doctor smirked at the Klingon</P>
<P>"What?" Oh Kahless help, B'Elanna thought, not knowing what to think, surely the EMH couldn't possibly know what she dreamt last night, could he?</P>
<P>"Your date with the warp core nacelles. You were sleepwalking last night, Lieutenant. Fortunately, Seven was on hand to make sure that you didn't get into any mischief."</P>
<P>B'Elanna was stunned. Sleepwalking?</P>
<P>"What did I do?"</P>
<P>"You decided to correct some minor malfunction in engineering. There is hardly any point in my taking you off duty if you continue to work in your sleep, Lieutenant," the Doctor grumbled.</P>
<P>B'Elanna just grinned, she thought it was hilarious. A thought occurred to her.</P>
<P>"You said Seven found me? What did she do?"</P>
<P>"I instructed her not to wake and see what you did. She reported back to me that she saw you safely back in your quarters after you finished tinkering with your engines."</P>
<P>"Oh." A vague idea was forming in her head and she wasn't quite sure what to do with it.</P>
<P>"What do I do to prevent this from happening again?" B'Elanna had no desire to go wandering about the ship in her nightwear again, even if it was to work on the engines.</P>
<P>"Under normal circumstances, I would prescribe a cortical inhibitor to prevent you going from REM sleep to the sleepwalking phase which is slightly different, but that may have an adverse effect on the memories that are gradually returning. The only thing that I can suggest is that you are locked into your room at night to keep you in."</P>
<P>"You are not having me locked in my room." B'Elanna wasn't having any of it.</P>
<P>"Best option for you. I'll discuss it with the Captain."</P>
<P>The rest of her two shifts were taken up with good-natured ribbing about running through the corridors of Voyager in her dressing gown. Though at first Janeway was concerned about the incident, the doctor assured her that though it was undoubtedly linked to the memory that had come to the surface the previous day, B'Elanna would not be hurt by the experience. </P>
<P>Janeway wondered again if she had done the right thing by advising Seven to show her love for B'Elanna. She knew that the ex-drone would have eventually found her own method of dealing with the problem, but maybe a more aggressive approach was the answer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna had a niggling question about last night that she needed answered, and once she got over her blushing fit, she sought Seven out in Astrometrics.</P>

</table>

<P>B'Elanna entered Astrometrics and stared at the shapely behind of the ex-Borg. </P>
<P>Seven had her back to her and was staring at the massive view screen, working on the Meridian - like planet that they were due to investigate in a few days time.</P>
<I>
<P>Seven really has the most stunning figure.</I> </P>
<P>The distracted thought came into B'Elanna's head as she opened her mouth to speak.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, how may I be of assistance? Is there anything I can do to help? Seven still had her back to the Klingon but turned to face her.</P>
<P>"How in Kahless name do you do that? How'd you know it was me?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled at the question.</P>
<P>"You have a unique personal scent, B'Elanna. I would know it anywhere," came the calm reply.</P>
<P>It had the effect of stopping B'Elanna in her tracks. It was an intensely personal thing to say, but she wasn't offended by it, actually, it kind of made her feel warm and tingly. Which brought her back to why she was here in the first place.</P>
<P>"Uh, Seven, I wanted to thank you for helping me out last night. You know, the whole sleepwalking thing." B'Elanna couldn't seem to keep still. She was beginning to feel nervous or agitated or something every time she was this close to Seven, and she wasn't sure how to deal with it. Her agitation didn't improve with Seven coming up and standing so close to her. </P>
<P>B'Elanna began to perspire.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"It was my pleasure, B'Elanna." Who had no idea how much of a pleasure it had been for Seven.</P>
<P>"There was something else, but I can see that you are busy. I'll just leave you to work."</P>
<P>B'Elanna knew that somehow, she was beginning to feel aroused by Seven and all she wanted to do was beat a hasty retreat and try and think things through. She started to turn away, but unexpectedly a warm hand descended on her shoulder, keeping her from leaving.</P>
<P>"I am quite happy to devote my time to you, B'Elanna. What did you want to ask me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked at the words, but that warm hand on her shoulder distracted her. Seven was applying a little pressure and ever so gently was squeezing and massaging her flesh through the thin uniform. B'Elanna felt that she should push the hand away, but it felt so good. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna? You wished to ask me something?" Seven prompted. She knew exactly the effect her gentle caresses were having on the engineer and had no intention of stopping.</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, her throat had gone dry. The tips of Seven's fingers were brushing along the edge of her tee-shirt, barely grazing the skin of her neck. It was driving B'Elanna out of her mind.</P>
<P>"I... um. I er...." She licked her lips, trying to compose herself and noticed that Seven's eyes had zeroed in on her mouth.</P>
<P>B'Elanna knew that she was falling under some sort of spell and shook herself out of it taking a few steps away from Seven. Immediately the contact broke, B'Elanna wanted to feel the warmth of Seven's hand again. But Seven had clasped her hands behind her back in her customary pose, raising her ocular implant.</P>
<P>"I just wanted to know what happened when you took me to bed last night." </P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes at the obvious Freudian slip. </P>
<P>"I...I mean what happened when you returned me to my quarters." B'Elanna desperately corrected herself, hoping that Seven didn't catch the slip.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seven raised her implant a little higher but responded to the question.</P>
<P>"I returned with you to your quarters and made sure that you did not suffer from another bout of sleepwalking."</P>
<P>"Yes, but the computer said that you were in my quarters for nearly 3 hours. Surely it didn't take that long to make sure I went back to sleep?"</P>
<P>"The Borg are nothing if not thorough." Seven was watching B'Elanna closely.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>For her, last night was almost like a dream come true. She had spent 2 hours and 49 minutes just watching B'Elanna sleep.  She had been content to lie there, occasionally brushing the deep chestnut hair away from the precious face and listening to the sounds that B'Elanna made in her sleep.</P>
<P>"Oh, OK." B'Elanna wanted to leave, but she also needed to stay, to be close to Seven.</P>
<P>"So what did you do all night?"</P>
<P>"I watched you sleep," Seven started to move closer to B'Elanna, who was mesmerised by the intensity of those blue eyes.</P>
<P>"You are very beautiful when you sleep, are you aware of that, B'Elanna?" Seven's breath was warm and sweet on B'Elanna's face, she was that close.</P>
<P>B'Elanna shook her head mutely, she could barely breathe.</P>
<P>"You make small sounds as you breathe and sometimes you reached out for something in the night. What were you reaching for, B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>"I don't know." B'Elanna voice was barely above a whisper.</P>
<P>"Yes you do. You know what you want." Seven lowered her head slightly, her eyes fastened on the dark brown ones of her lover, not breaking contact.</P>
<I><P>She's about to kiss me</I>. The thought echoed in her head, breaking the spell. She wasn't ready for this.</P>
<P>B'Elanna pushed Seven away, but not roughly. She was scared. What is happening to me? Why do I feel this way about Seven. We've only just become friends for Kahless sake. In her hearts, B'Elanna knew that they were much more than just friends.</P>
<P>"Seven, what is happening to me? What are you doing?" The Klingon ran her hands through her hair, she couldn't think straight.</P>
<P>Seven's heart was pounding. Perhaps she had been in error to try for too much too soon. She knew that the emotions and feelings were still there. She would just have to bide her time with B'Elanna.</P>
<P>She walked up to the pacing and clearly upset engineer and placed her hands on the shorter woman's shoulders, stilling her. This time, there was nothing sexual about the touch, only comfort.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, look at me. I want you to understand something." B'Elanna stood still, but would not meet Seven's gaze. The Borg placed her hand under B'Elanna's chin and gently tilted her head until their eyes met and locked.</P>
<P>" I have told you that I am willing to give you anything. B'Elanna, you have been my best, my only friend. There's nothing like the joy that you bring. I wonder what would happen, if you would trust in me. I'll make you believe, I'll make you see, there's no need to run from me."</P>
<P>There were tears in Seven's eyes as she tried to show how much B'Elanna meant to her.</P>
<P>I know that you've been hurt before, let me heal your pain. I won't ever let you hurt anymore. Whatever it takes to make you happy, whatever it takes to make you smile, whatever it takes to make you feel good, B'Elanna, I will be there for you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked her tears away and shook her head slightly.</P>
<P>"Seven, I can't deal with this right now. I need ...." She trailed off not really knowing what she needed.</P>
<P>"I..., I have to go." </P>
<P>The confused woman stumbled away, her mind trying to grasp all that had just taken place.</P>
<P>Seven stood alone in Astrometrics, wondering again if she had given B'Elanna more than she could handle. She thought again of the conversation that had taken place with the Captain and the promise she had made to B'Elanna while she was still unconscious in sickbay. She said the words out loud to remind herself.</P>
<P>"I will not give up on you B'Elanna. I will not give up on us."</P>
<P>Seven took courage from those words.</P>
