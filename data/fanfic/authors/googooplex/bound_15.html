<!-- Bound \ Chapter 15 - When Darkness Falls -->

<P>B'Elanna eyed the Doctor impatiently. She hated being in sickbay when all she had to do was work on the EMH's holo-emitters. She liked it even less as a patient.</P>
<P>"You are clearly not taking your rehabilitation seriously, Lieutenant," the doctor commented as he scanned her.</P>
<P>"I distinctly recall instructing you to work for no more than 6 hours at any one stretch and to have at least 10 hours sleep every night."</P>
<P>"Doctor, be serious, even Naomi doesn't get that much sleep." B'Elanna folded her arms obstinately.</P>
<P>"And Naomi Wildman isn't recovering from major brain surgery," the doctor shot back. He made a few notations on his padd and tut tutted a few times. "I can also tell that you've been skipping meals as well."</P>
<P>"Quit fussing, I'm fine." B'Elanna burst out.</P>
<P>"Here, take this." The Doctor handed her a data padd.</P>
<P>"What's this?" B'Elanna looked at it curiously.</P>
<P>"It's a detailed regiment that I expect you to follow over the next two weeks. There is a breakdown of suggested exercises and activities that aren't too strenuous and some tasks that I'd like you to avoid. We'll review it ...."</P>
<P>"You've got to be kidding, there's no way I'm going to spend the next two weeks doing this stuff."</P>
<P>"Fine. If you're not willing to take my recommendations then I'll simply have you confined to sickbay for the next two weeks instead. How's that sound?"</P>
<P>The bristling engineer glared at him.</P>
<P>"Hmm, I thought not. This is for your own good and if you follow it to the letter, it'll only be for a short while."</P>
<P>She gave him a sour smile as she took a closer look at his instructions. </P>
<P>"Are we done now?"</P>
<P>"Not quite. Just a few more test." He shone a light into her pupils judging their reaction.</P>
<P>"Any nausea?"</P>
<P>"None."</P>
<P>"Headaches?"</P>
<P>"Apart from you?" she rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>The hologram straightened, waiting for an answer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sighed, "No headaches."</P>
<P>"Dizziness, disorientation?"</P>
<P>"No, doctor, none of those things." </P>
<P>"Excellent," the Doctor beamed. "I have to admit, despite your flagrant disregard of my instructions, you are well on the road to full recovery."</P>
<P>He began to tidy up. "There have been no bouts of Aphasia, no sleepwalking, no violent moods swings. Not that anyone would really know the difference with you, Lieutenant." He blithely ignored the glare that she aimed at him as he finished his check up.</P>
<P>"When am I going to get my memories back?"</P>
<P>"When they're ready, don't push it. It's possible they'll come back piecemeal. And stay away from Tuvok. This is no time to be dabbling in Vulcan healing techniques."</P>
<P>"Can I go now?" She was severely irritated.</P>
<P>The Doctor ALWAYS pushed her to the limit.</P>
<P>"I'll see you bright and early this time next week, Lieutenant. And don't forget, we'll spend lots of time together if you don't stick to that regimen."</P>
<P>B'Elanna swore quietly under her breath as she walked away.</P>
<P>"Oh, Lieutenant Torres," the doc called her back.</P>
<P> She turned and raised an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"It's 1600hrs. You're officially off duty until 1000 tomorrow. Have a nice evening."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's shoulders slumped as she left sickbay. What the hell was she supposed to do with her time?</P>
<P>She bumped into Naomi Wildman and smiled at the child who was skipping happily along the corridors.</P>
<P>"Hi, Lieutenant," the child chirped happily</P>
<P>"Hey Naomi, where are you off to?"</P>
<P>"Seven's promised to play kadiskot with me once she gets off duty. She said I could wait for her at her quarters. D'you want to play? Seven's really good."</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at the schedule the doctored had given her. He recommended an hour of painting watercolours followed by a nap. He had to be kidding.</P>
<P>"Sure why not?" She took the child's hand and walked towards Seven's quarters.</P>

<hr>

<P>The senior crew was sat around the conference table as usual discussing ship's affairs. For the first time in ages, it seemed, the picture was rosy. Or as rosy as it could be stuck 60 million light years away from home, in a distant part of the galaxy, with no friends ....(bring out the violins!)</P>
<P>Janeway and Chakotay were waxing lyrically over some new spatial phenomena that was worth investigating. For once, it was very close to their position and Voyager wouldn't lose any precious resources chasing this spatial rift.</P>
<P>Janeway was going through the department heads to make sure the ship and it's crew would be able to withstand the temporal eddies that might exist closer to the phenomena.</P>
<P>"According to Starfleet records a similar phenomena was discovered in the Gamma Quadrant by the crew of the USS Defiant," Seven reported.</P>
<P>"The Defiant?" Janeway turned to face the Borg. "That was Benjamin Sisko's command."</P>
<P>"Did you know him, Captain?" Chakotay asked curiously.</P>
<P>"Only by reputation. Good Captain, with a difficult job. Carry on, Seven."</P>
<P>"The Defiant found that these anomalies disguised a planet that existed out of phase with normal time. The planet, known as Meridian returned to our normal space and time only once every 60 years. There is a 79.8% probability that the spatial eddies that we have observed mask a similar planet."</P>
<P>"You know Captain, I'm getting to be a little wary of planets that are masked by one type of natural cloud or something," B'Elanna commented idly.</P>
<P>Janeway and Seven looked at her sharply, but she didn't notice.</P>
<P>"I mean the last time the ship needed a overhaul we wound up with the Kalahari and that bastard Nordik ..."</P>
<P>The room went very quiet.</P>
<P>B'Elanna sat very still and looked at her hands as they rested on the polished wood of the conference table, they trembled, badly.</P>
<P>She knew that something had happened, something she had just said, but she couldn't put her finger on it, she tried to concentrate, but the noise in her head was too loud. It was too loud.</P>
<P>Her surroundings, her friends, her captain, they seemed to fade away in the intense burning light. It hurt her eyes.</P>
<P>She closed her eyes, but her mind filled with images, flashes of light and sound and vivid, violent and child-like eyes. Her mind filled with the image of those eyes, those eyes and then, pain. So much pain.</P>
<P>Another sound, a noise, it sounded like the Howl of Death, it was filled with pain and anger.</P>
<P>It was coming from her.</P>
<P>Tom, who was closest, clasped her shoulder, trying to comfort, but she flung him away, her eyes unseeing, a trickle of deep red blood running from her nose.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna!" Janeway called to her, trying to bring her engineer back from the brink of agony.</P>
<P>But B'Elanna didn't, couldn't respond. She was caught up in the jaws of memory, re-living every minute of her horrific assault. She crouched in a corner, her arms trying to protect her head from the blows, still howling in pain and anger.</P>
<P>Seven leapt over the table and feel to her knees beside B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, do not be afraid. You are strong. You will overcome this." She said the words quietly, but with a strange kind of confidence. She knew that B'Elanna could withstand almost anything.</P>
<P>B'Elanna focused on the voice and looked at Seven.</P>
<P>"He hurt me. They hurt us. Why?" B'Elanna whispered brokenly. Her eyes rolled back in her head and she collapsed, unconscious.</P>

<hr>

<P>"I've decided to release her back to her quarters, Captain," the Doctor informed.</P>
<P>"Is that wise? She was in a really bad way, practically reliving some of her memories." Janeway felt shivers as she recalled the spine-chilling screams of B'Elanna's agony.</P>
<P>"Well, she regained consciousness after a few moments and seemed aware of her surroundings and what had happened. It appears that only another small fragment of her memory returned, apparently the most traumatic episode."</P>
<P>"And?" Janeway was impatient.</P>
<P>"And, nothing. She's comfortable, I've prescribed a mild sedative to help her sleep. And I've ordered her to visit me when she wakes. She may want to discuss the memory of her brutal beating and the emotions they aroused." He raised his eyebrows meaningfully.</P>
<P>"However, knowing Lieutenant Torres, she may not. We'll just have to wait and see."</P>
<P>"Shouldn't someone be with her? Is she alright on her own?"</P>
<P>"Tom took B'Elanna back to her quarters with instructions to tuck her in. She'll be fine."</P>
<P>Janeway nodded, satisfied.</P>
<P>She knew that all of this must have been pretty hard on Seven and decided to check up on her. She wasn't really surprised to find that the ex-drone working in Astrometrics. Ever since the assault, Seven had buried herself in her work, not being able to take the initiative with B'Elanna. Not able to rekindle the love that they previously shared.</P>
<P>"Captain." Seven acknowledged Janeway as she entered the room.</P>
<P>"I came to find out how you were, Seven," the Captain explained gently.</P>
<P>"I am functioning adequately, Captain," Seven responded calmly.</P>
<P>Janeway made no comment and simply stared at the ex-drone.</P>
<P>"I find myself in a dilemma, I wished to experience the emotions that seemed to come so easily to humans. But now that I have these feelings, I fear that they will overwhelm me. My heart hurts even though I know that my cardiac muscle is undamaged. I have shed more tears than I thought possible and yet, I could still cry each and every time that I look at B'Elanna and know that she sees me as nothing other than a colleague."</P>
<P>"Would you give up that short time you had together, when you experienced all those emotions that you longed for?"</P>
<P>Seven shook her head. She remembered the larks. " No, never. Only with B'Elanna was I ever truly free."</P>
<P>"Then don't regret what you felt for her. Instead try to rekindle it. You don't need to tell her how much you love her, but you could gradually begin to show her, the same way you showed your love to her before."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her Captain and smiled.</P>
<P>"Thank you."</P>
