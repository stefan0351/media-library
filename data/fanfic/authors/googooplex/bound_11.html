<!-- Bound \ Chapter 11 - Bound ('til parted by death) -->

<P>B'Elanna couldn't stop smiling, her heart was literally overflowing with happiness. She stole a quick look at Seven, working at the other end of the matrix conversion chamber and giggled out loud.</P>
<P>Not even the lumbering Nordik could break her out of her good mood. They had nearly completed their assignment and should be able to return to Voyager in another 6 or 7 hours. She couldn't wait. She had plans for Seven. Big plans. She swallowed hard as she thought of what she and Seven would with all their free time on Voyager. They were both due for some time off and B'Elanna intended to use it wisely. They would spend it in bed. All of it.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was shaken out of her extremely enjoyable daydream by Nordik coming up to her. Once again he stood far too close.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, in honour of working and trade, please honour me by having this," Despite his immense size, the Kalahari male had a soft and child-like voice. He was offering B'Elanna some form of gift. It was a small, carved wooden box, no more than 6 inches in length. </P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked, not sure how to respond. She wasn't sure she wanted to accept the gesture. One the one hand, she didn't like Nordik, he was a pain in the ass, he kept rubbing up against her and, sin of all sins, he was a lousy engineer. But on the other, this was a diplomatic mission, she didn't want to offend the Kalahari race and, which was the clincher, Seven loved her.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Nordik." She realised that he probably expected her to reciprocate and quickly grabbed up an extra toolkit and presented it to him.</P>
<P>"This is for you on behalf of the engineering team." Nordik smiled in childlike wonder and accepted the gift.</P>
<P>"You have not opened the gift," he urged her.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna suddenly noticed that the carved wooded box in her hands actually had hinges and opened up length-wise. She opened it, curiously.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stared at the contents in silence for a beat.</P>
<P>"You have got to be kidding me!" She snapped the box shut and looked up at the git.</P>
<P>"Is this ...?"</P>
<P>"It is a lock of my hair," he confirmed simply.</P>
<I><P>Yuck</I>. B'Elanna hoped she hadn't said the word out loud. She thrust the box back at Nordik.</P>
<P>"There is no way that I can accept this, Nordik. It is completely inappropriate."</P>
<P>He just looked at her.</P>
<P>"You have already accepted."</P>
<P>She flashed him a grim smile, "My mistake, here, I don't want it."</P>
<P>"You have accepted."</P>
<P>She took a deep breath and tried to explain. "Listen, Nordik, in my culture, certain gifts carry particular significance." She eyed him to see if she was getting through. </P>
<P>"Certain gifts mean friendship, loyalty, love, whatever. This lock of hair is an incredibly personal thing, at least for us humans. I wouldn't feel right accepting it from you. Do you understand?"</P>
<P>Nordik blinked, considering her words carefully.</P>
<P>"It is meant to be personal. You have accepted."</P>

<hr>

<P>Seven was working in an adjoining antechamber and her thoughts were consumed with just one thing.</P>
<I><P>She will not deny us this time.</I> Seven thought. <I>Once the assignment is complete, we will return to Voyager, attend the debriefing meeting and then we shall retire to B'Elanna's quarters. I shall not be satisfied until I have pleasured every inch of her body. I will love her mercilessly until she is weak and begging for release. I will ...</P>
</I>
<P>Seven was distracted from her determined plans for B'Elanna's body by Fretax entering the chamber beside her. </P>
<P>Fretax was Nordik's assistant and had been assigned to help Seven complete her work in the matrix converter. She was one of the ubiquitous aliens that appeared to have decided to live on Kalahari. She was a very competent engineer, much better at her job than Nordik, but very rarely spoke except to Nordik. Seven had deduced that Fretax had some form of emotional attachment to Nordik. Perhaps they were mates.</P>
<P>She looked at the silent little alien.</P>
<P>"Fretax, how may I be of assistance?" she asked politely.</P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna was getting pissed off with the whole affair. She just wanted to finish her assignment and take Seven back home."</P>
<P>"Am I not making myself clear? I do not want your gift. And what the hell do you mean, it's meant to be personal."</P>
<P>"You have consented to be bound to me. That would make it personal." </P>
<P>"Wha...?" B'Elanna couldn't comprehend what was going on. She read the cultural database, as all away teams were required when conducting diplomatic missions and she knew that there was no mention of being bound to anyone for accepting a gift.</P>
<P>"Nordik, I don't know what you think is going to happen here, but I'm not about to be bound or anything else to you. This conversation is over. In fact, this mission is over, you are just going to have to finish up on your own. Seven and I are leaving right now." She turned away, not really believing what had just happened.</P>

<hr>

<P>Fretax stood silently and considered the taller borg.</P>
<P>"I have been instructed to provide you with this instrument." She held out a standard hypospanner to Seven."</P>
<P>Seven looked at it, without taking it from the woman.</P>
<P>"I do not require this hypospanner, you may place it in the toolkit." </P>
<P>"No." Fretax calmly placed the tool on the console beside Seven and walked away.</P>
<P>Seven frowned and considered the departing back of Fretax and the item she left behind. She was at a loss to understand the alien's behaviour. She decided that the reasons for the woman's actions were irrelevant and decided to replace the tool herself.</P>
<P>Within seconds of touching the tool, Seven knew that there was something wrong. Her bionetic implants were malfunctioning. Her respiration and heartbeat suddenly went off the scale and eyes began to loose focus.</P>
<P>Though Seven instantly knew that she had been poisoned, recalling that Fretax had been wearing latex gloves, but, her first thought was for B'Elanna's safety. As she tried to tap on her combadge, her legs gave way and she collapsed on the floor. She was still conscious despite the crushing pain in her chest and could see out of the antechamber.</P>
<P>At the far end, through her fading vision, she could see B'Elanna with Nordik. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna," she called out, but her voice was weak. Whatever substance had been introduced to her, it was taking effect very quickly. She couldn't feel her legs and her body was rapidly growing cold. </P>

<hr>

<P>B'Elanna had her back to Nordik as she decided to get Seven and leave, but her instincts made her turn back. His blow met her square in the jaw.</P>
<P>"You will be a better mate than Fretax, you have more talent with engineering. You will bring me much honour."</P>
<P>She didn't stop to think why this was happening, the Klingon in her simply responded to the attack. She highkicked Nordik, catching him unawares, her foot connecting just under his chin.</P>
<P>He didn't even pause, swinging his club-like fist, raining blows down from his great height. </P>
<P>B'Elanna gave every bit as good as she got, but Nordik was too big and too strong, she knew that he would soon be able to wear her down. She couldn't even get her hand to her combadge to get an emergency beam out.</P>
<P>Not taking her eyes off her attacker, she screamed out, </P>
<P>"Seven, I need you."</P>
<P>There was no response and B'Elanna knew that Seven must be hurt. Looking towards the antechamber the borg had been working on she could just about see her Seven's blond hair splayed out on the floor.</P>
<P>A red rush of pure unadulterated rage coursed through Torres and she charged Nordik and grappled with him. She knew that she needed to get him on the floor, she, they had a better chance of survival if she managed it.</P>
<P>Even as she tried to wrestle him, she felt the sting of an injection on the back of her neck. She felt her legs give way and a weakness come over her. As she fell to the floor, she wondered if this would be the day that she died. </P>
<P>"You will make an excellent mate, but you will never resist my will again. We will be bound." Nordik still spoke in the same child-like tone, never taking his vivid violet eyes off her.</P>
<P>Even as he spoke, Nordik continued to kick the prone woman, she tried to curl into a ball to protect herself but she could hear her bones break.</P>
<P>He knelt down beside her and circled her throat with his huge hands.</P>
<P>"I will not kill you. We will be bound. Fretax prepared the dose. I will be happy soon."</P>
<P>"I'd rather die," she forced the words out of her mangled face.</P>
<P>Unexpectedly, Nordik collapsed over her, blood rushing from his head.</P>
<P>Seven had crawled from the antechamber and used the toolkit that B'Elanna had given him to bash Nordik over the head. </P>
<P>She pushed the prone body aside and gathered B'Elanna up in her arms.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna please speak to me," But the Klingon had lapsed into unconsciousness.</P>
<P>"Seven, to Voyager, emergency beam out. Officers injured."</P>


<P>They were beamed directly to sickbay, anxious hands assisting Seven to her feet. The doctor looked over at her, and seeing that she was stable immediately rushed over to the unconscious Klingon.</P>
<P>"What in God's name happened, " the Doctor was appalled at B'Elanna's injuries as he began to assess her. "Seven, what happened?"</P>
<P>The tears were streaming down Seven's face as she struggled to get the words out. </P>
<P>"He kept kicking her when she rejected him," she said brokenly. "She was injected with something. Please don't let her die. B'Elanna must live. She must live." The effects of the drug administered to Seven previously took their toll and she felt herself lapsing into unconsciousness.</P>
<I><P>You must remain awake for B'Elanna,</I> she told herself, instilling steel into her backbone. <I>You must stay be by her side. She needs you.</P>
</I>
<P>"Mr Paris, please tend to Seven."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna needs me, doctor." Tom felt ill as he looked at his friend and ex-wife.</P>
<P>"Tom, you're too close to this, do as they doctor says," the medic insisted.</P>
<P>The doctor looked at the broken Klingon on the biobed and quickly checked her vitals. Her hearts rates were slow, way too slow. Pulse weak and thready. Respiration... none.</P>
<P>"We need to intubate her now, "</P>
<P>He worked quickly with the medic to place the breathing apparatus down B'Elanna's  throat to help her breathe. It was a race against the clock, if oxygen didn't get to her brain and soon, the brain cells would begin to necrotize. </P>
<P>Once they had her breathing stabilised, the Doctor scanned his patient to assess the extent of her injuries.</P>
<P>Massive physical trauma. Broken pelvis, shattered clavicle, almost all of her ribs were broken, puncturing the lungs and there were several skull fractures.</P>
<P> How in the world is that even possible? The Klingons have the hardest skulls in the known galaxy. The doctor moved round the biobed quickly, administering stimulants to keep her hearts beating. Her found out how it was possible to fracture a Klingon skull as he gently turned B'Elanna's head to check the reaction of her pupils. The clear imprint of the hobnailed boot used by Nordik was stamped across B'Elanna's face, crushing her eye socket and shattering the cheekbone.</P>
<P>Just then Janeway rushed in and saw the damage to her engineer. She went a sickly grey colour as approached the bed, but said nothing, at first.</P>
<P>"What the hell happened to my crew?" Her tone was deadly.</P>
<P>"Seven may be able to shed more light on events when she is able. Suffice it to say, B'Elanna is in grave danger." He and a medic were rushing round the biobed try to repair the damage. </P>
<P>The monitors began emitting a high pitch tone.</P>
<P>"Now, what?" the Doctor quickly checked the readings, Janeway reading over his shoulder.</P>
<P>"Her neural patterns are destabilising, Seven said that she was injected with something, but I can't isolate anything in her blood chemistry or her neural pathways."</P>
<P>"You must save her." Seven was inconsolable.</P>
<P>"10mm of cortrozene," the Doctor snapped. "Seven, what did they inject her with? Do you know?"</P>
<P>"The Kalahari called Nordik said that it was so that B'Elanna would be bound to him..."</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"But his mate was jealous, She must have poisoned the drug." Sven's throat was raw from crying but she edged closer to the bed steeling herself to the sight, determined to be of use.</P>
<P>"When B'Elanna rejected him, he... he lost all reason and began a frenzied attack on her. I couldn't help her. I could not stop him. I ... I... " Seven could continue no further.</P>
<P>"I found traces of a paralysing agent in her blood," Tom informed the Captain quietly. " It should have killed her."</P>
<P>Janeway nodded grimly, her eyes fastened on B'Elanna, willing her to fight. </P>
<P>"I need to prepare her for surgery, right now, but I still can't isolate the poison. She may not survive the operation with this pathogen in her system. Captain you need to find out what they used on her."</P>
<P>Janeway nodded curtly and walked over to her unconscious engineer, she leaned close to her ear and whispered.</P>
<P>"Today is not a good day to die. You <B>will</B> survive this. That's an order, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>She strode out of sickbay, pausing only to offer what comfort she could to the stricken Seven.</P>
<P>There was an unnatural quiet of the bridge when she arrived. Chakotay stood and looked at her, worry etched on his face.</P>
<P>"How are they?"</P>
<P>"Not good. B'Elanna's in grave danger. Harry get me the Kalahari First Minister. Open a channel."</P>
<P>The First Minister appeared on the viewscreen. His hair was not as platinum white as his junior minister but his eyes had the same vivid shade of violet.</P>
<P>"Captain, how may I be of service?"</P>
<P>"Two of my crew were viciously assaulted whist working in your technology division. My Chief engineer was battered to a pulp and injected with an unknown poison. I want the perpetrators and I want to know what they've done to my crew."</P>
<P>"This is all very alarming, Captain. Are you sure that you're facts are correct?"</P>
<P>"Let me be properly understood, First Minister," Janeway was cold, hard and implacable. "A member of my crew is dying because of the actions of your people. The male called Nordik is responsible. You better get me the antidote." She almost spat the words out.</P>
<P>"Allow me to investigate the matter," he offered, chastened.</P>
<P>"You have 5 minutes. Close the channel."</P>
<I><P>What if there is no antidote?</P>
</I>
<P>Janeway felt sick at the thought, but she quelled it. Be positive, be positive.</P>
<P>Exactly 3 minutes and 54 seconds later, the first Minister reappeared.</P>
<P>He shrugged his shoulders in a manner Janeway found insultingly casual, considering the circumstances.</P>
<P>"Captain, what can I say. Affairs of the heart and recruitment were never meant to go hand in hand."</P>
<P>"What the hell are you talking about? Whose recruitment?" Janeway was baffled, then she understood.</P>
<P>"You were trying to forcibly enslave my staff. That's how you maintain all your borrowed technology. That explains why so many aliens mate with your people. You capture and enslave foreign species."</P>
<P>"Our recruitment policies are an internal affair, Captain Janeway," he replied pompously.</P>
<P>"Tell me how to save her," she ground out.</P>
<P>"Primary Technician Nordik, selected your engineer to be bound to him. She accepted, but then reneged at the time of the ceremony. Nordik was within his rights to express his displeasure."</P>
<P>"What have you done to my officer?" she roared, at the end of her tether.</P>
<P>"You must to return her to the homeworld. There is no antidote. Her body chemistry is being resequenced to match the biorhythms of her bound partner, Nordik. She must be with him or she will die with the week.</P>
<P>"You expect me to give her to you?" Janeway was incredulous.</P>
<P>"The decision is yours, Captain. If you choose to keep her, she will die." The First Minister yawned. "Let me know when you have prepared her for transport. Oh and Captain, you will find that your transporters will no longer work. Our magnomemetic field has been updated with your ship configurations. You will not be able to penetrate it."</P>
<P>Janeway gestured to Harry to close the channel. She felt ill. "Try and locate this Nordik person, see if you hail him or beam to the brig, anything."</P>
<P>"Aye, Ma'am." Harry work feverishly.</P>
<P>"Captain, it would appear that the First Minister is telling the truth. Our sensors can no longer penetrate the magnomemetic field. Rather than being a structure left by an alien technology, as they told us, it would appear to be a device that the Kalahari are able to manipulate." Tuvok was dispassionate as he reported his findings.</P>
<P>Janeway pinched the bridge of her nose, this was getting from bad to worse.</P>
<P>"There is no way that I'm giving her to them," she stated the obvious.</P>
<P>"Captain, there no response, not from anywhere. It's as if the planet doesn't even exist." Harry was regretful. He was also worried sick about his friend in sickbay.</P>
<P>Before she could respond, the doctor hailed the bridge.</P>
<P>"Go ahead, doctor," her heart sank.</P>
<P>"You'd better come to sickbay, Captain."</P>
<P>"I'm on my way."</P>
<P>When Janeway reached sickbay, she found Seven standing beside the biobed, leaning over the unconscious Klingon, stroking her hair and whispering softly to her.</P>
<P>Tom was monitoring the medical console and the doctor was in his office.</P>
<P>"What's the news doctor?"</P>
<P>"She came through the surgery, but the poison in her bloodstream has made matters worse." He showed the Captain a data padd with his findings.</P>
<P>"I take it you got no joy from the Kalahari?"</P>
<P>She shook her head.</P>
<P>"It seems that the poison, rather than affecting the tissue cells, it is migrating to her brain stem and forming a mass of some type."</P>
<P>"Doctor, I don't understand."</P>
<P>"It's causing a tumour to form in B'Elanna's brain. That's the only effect that it's having on her, for now. She has lapsed into a coma because of the pressure on her brain, but, and here's the good news, I may be able to save her."</P>
<P>Janeway looked up sharply at that.</P>
<P>"I am monitoring the rate of growth of the tumour, if it doesn't exceed 12.79mm by 14.39mm, I'll be able to operate to remove it. But there are many variables," he added before the Captain got too excited.</P>
<P>"After all that her body's been through, there's no telling whether she will be strong enough to withstand the brain surgery. It will be a delicate and painstaking procedure. No to mention, lengthy."</P>
<P>"B'Elanna's strong and courageous, she'll fight all the way." Janeway affirmed</P>
<P>"And then there's the added bonus of the somewhat erratic nature of the Klingon physiology," the doctor continued without missing a beat. "It may decide to simply shut down and deal with the problem in it's own way. If that happens, all I can do is make her comfortable and hope for the best. If I try to countermand her body's own instructions, I may do incalculable damage."</P>
<P>The Captain nodded and looked out of the doctor's office at Seven, her position had not changed, but she was a deathly pale and still covered in B'Elanna's blood.</P>
<P>"How's Seven doing?"</P>
<P>"A little better, now that she's got something to focus on. Her nanoprobes managed to remove the paralysing agents from her bloodstream and they've done no permanent damage to her systems. But she is in shock and needs to sleep. Perhaps you could help with that, Captain?"</P>
<P>Janeway shook her head decisively, "Do what you can for Seven here, Doctor. She needs to be with B'Elanna. At least for now."</P>
<P>He nodded. " I had no idea that they had got so close."</P>
<P>"They mean the world to each other," she said sadly. Her heart ached for the pain that she knew Seven must be going through.</P>
<P>"Keep me informed." She instructed as she left the Doctor.</P>
<P>Janeway walked over to the biobed and stood at the foot, not wanting to intrude.</P>
<P>Seven looked up at her, her face pale and streaked with fresh tears.</P>
<P>"Has the Doctor informed you?"</P>
<P>Janeway nodded.</P>
<P>"Has the Kalahari animal that did this been detained yet?" There was venom in her tone, even though her voice was low.</P>
<P>"We're working on it, Seven. You just focus on B'Elanna now. She needs you."</P>
<P>Seven nodded and turned back to the face of her love.</P>
<P>Janeway realised that Seven was humming very softly to B'Elanna. </P>

<I><P>Don't give up B'Elanna, please don't give up.</I> Janeway blinked the tears from her eyes as she walked away.</P>

<hr>

<P>It had been eight days since the incident on the Kalahari homeworld.</P>
<P>B'Elanna remained in coma and Seven remained by her side.</P>
<P> Janeway had tried every method she knew how including armed confrontation with the Kalahari, but it had all been to no avail. Voyager no longer had the ability to communicate with or transport to the planet.</P>
<P>A heated and unpleasant debate had taken place in the conference room over the best line of action. </P>
<P>Tuvok had advocated a retreat, as they were accomplishing nothing by remaining in orbit round the planet. They were expending vital resources in trying to come up with a means of making the Kalahari pay for their actions. </P>
<P>"So you suggest we just tuck our tail between our legs and run for cover, is that it Tuvok?" Tom was bitter.</P>
<P>"Fighting with an opponent who does not respond is emotional and counter productive, Mr Paris. Lieutenant Torres would be better served if we concentrated our efforts in finding a cure for her condition." </P>
<P>"Her condition! She's in that condition because of those bastards, are you so caught up in logic that you don't see that?" Tom burst out.</P>
<P>"As you were, Lieutenant." Janeway snapped. She sympathised with the helmsman, but dissent in the ranks was the last thing she needed right now.</P>
<P>"I have to agree with Tuvok," Chakotay spoke quietly. </P>
<P>He had known B'Elanna the longest and for the first time he was scared that she might not come back. He had prayed to his ancestors, that they guide her back the warm embrace of those that loved her. He didn't care that it was selfish and that the spirit world had the right to claim her. He knew, perhaps better than most, that B'Elanna was the life force of the ship. She helped to keep it going in more ways than one. If she died ...</P>
<P>"We are sitting ducks out here. We have no way of telling if the Kalahari have powerful friends on their way to vapourise us. We need to be working with the Doctor."</P>
<P>Janeway sighed deeply, in her heart she wanted to take B'Elanna's Bat'leth, beam down to the planet and hack this Nordik creature into a thousand twitching and bloody lumps. She wanted to hear him scream and beg in mortal agony</P>
<P>But she needed to be ruled by her head. She had a responsibility to her entire crew. They had to leave, whether she liked it or not.</P>
<P>Tom was furious at Chakotay. "I expected more from you, she gave up everything for you ..."</P>
<P>"Don't let me tell you again, Tom." Her voice was lethal.</P>
<P>Tom sank back in his seat, dejected. He was clearly hurting.</P>
<P>"This is hard on all of us, but we're Starfleet Officers, we have to be objective. Or at least I do," her voice gentled.</P>
<P>She sighed and made her decision. </P>
<P>"There is nothing more to be gained by staying. We've explored every available option of trying to detain the animal responsible or to persuade the Kalahari to help us with a cure. We've failed. It's time to leave. </P>
<P>The words left a bitter taste in her mouth.</P>
