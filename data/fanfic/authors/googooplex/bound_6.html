<!-- Bound \ Chapter 6 - For You -->

<P>Seven returned to her alcove and sat on the floor in a corner and began to cry. She cried her heart out. She had her knees up against her chest and rocked herself as she sobbed.</P>
<P>She didn't hear the cargobay doors open or notice that she was no longer alone until she felt a hand shaking her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Seven, are you alright?" Naomi had never seen the resident borg so distressed before and it frightened her. </P>
<P>"Should I call the doctor, or... or the Captain? Maybe my mum could help?"</P>
<P>Seven could not stop the tears streaming down her face as she looked at the child.</P>
<P>"Naomi Wildman, I do not require assistance at this time. Please leave." The crying fit was over but she was exhausted and rested her forehead on her knees.</P>
<P>Naomi thought for a second and then came to a decision. She sat down, next to her friend and gently rubbed her should in sympathy.</P>
<P>Seven didn't lift her head but felt the intended comfort from the child. </P>
<P>"Naomi Wildman, state your intention." Her voice was muffled and the sound of her tears could clearly be heard.</P>
<P>"Well it always helps me to talk to someone when I'm upset or angry. So maybe, you could talk to me." Naomi looked at her bowed head curiously, "Why are you so sad?"</P>
<P>"I did something horrible to someone I call a friend," she confessed</P>
<P>"When I make my Mum angry or upset, it usually helps to say how sorry I am for being naughty. You could tell your friend that you are sorry." </P>
<P>"Mere words are not enough. There are no words..." Seven trailed off, overwhelmed at the emotional rollercoaster she was going through.</P>
<P>"Well you could make a present, or write a poem or draw a picture or replicate their favourite meal or do something really nice for them. That helps as well," Naomi nodded knowledgeably. </P>
<P>Seven looked up, "Completing any or all of these tasks will demonstrate my regret?"</P>
<P>"Sure, but make sure you say sorry real soon. Like today or tomorrow."</P>
<P>"Explain"</P>
<P>Naomi crinkled her ridge forehead, "I don't quite know but both Neelix and my mum seem to think that it's real important."</P>
<P>Seven sat up straight and wiped the moisture from her eyes. She had a plan of action to try and make things right.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Naomi Wildman, your advice has been most informative." It was a day for doing things out of character. Seven leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on the forehead of the child. "Thank you, Naomi," she whispered softly.</P>

<P>B'Elanna was working in engineer a few hours later, she had been to the doctor and had her broken jaw reset and come up with a suitable lie to get him off her back. She couldn't sleep or eat so she decided to work. At least working could cure all her ills.</P>
<P>She was aware the minute Seven walked into engineer, her senses could pick up the woman's scent at 50 paces. B'Elanna didn't look up from her console as Seven approached and only acknowledged her when she spoke softly.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, may I have a moment of your time?"</P>
<P>"Of course, Seven, what can I do for you?" She was calm and very polite. But Seven's heart sank as she looked into those deep-brown velvet eyes. Gone was the usual warmth and laughter and friendship that she was used to, now they looked completely unreadable. Seven had no idea what B'Elanna was thinking or feeling.</P>
<P>She clasped her hands behind her back to stop them from shaking.</P>
<P>"I know that you said that we would talk tomorrow, but I would be grateful if we could talk today."</P>
<P>B'Elanna crossed her arms and raised her eyebrows, she should have known that Seven wouldn't wait.</P>
<P>"When do you suggest?"</P>
<P>"Now, but somewhere private," Seven sounded calm but inside she was shaking like jelly.</P>
<P>"OK, I'll been done here soon, Why don't you go to my quarters, I'll be there in say 20 minutes?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded in relief and walked quickly away before B'Elanna could change her mind.</P>
<P>She waited nervously in B'Elanna's quarters and for the hundredth time wondered if the gifts she had made were inadequate. She knew that B'Elanna would never tolerate anyone touching her engines without her permission, so she decided against completing a one-woman overhaul. She also knew that the half-Klingon had a sturdy constitution and would eat almost anything put in front of her, so Seven decided to be creative. She had made a miniature replica of Voyagers engines made out of rare Zambesi gold, she had to trade 4 months of holodeck privileges with a junior crewman to obtain the gold. She had also hand-carved a tritanium Met'leth to add to B'Elanna's small collection of Klingon weapons. Finally she had unearthed an old earth song that seemed appropriate. </P>
<P>B'Elanna walked into the lounge and unzipped her jacket. She looked at seven without say a word and went over to the replicator.</P>
<P>"Do you want anything to eat or drink, Seven?" she asked politely.</P>
<P>Seven shook her head, her tongue had glued itself to the roof of her mouth. The words of apology and regret that she had carefully prepared dried up in her throat.</P>
<P>B'Elanna ordered a tall glass of lemonade and turned to look at the trembling blond.</P>
<P>"Sit down, Seven." It wasn't an invitation and Seven complied immediately.</P>
<P>"You broke my jaw, this afternoon, did you know that?" B'Elanna asked conversationally as she took a sip of her drink. "I had to tell the doctor that we working on a fitness regime and I forgot to duck." She watched as tears filled the Borg's eyes. She sighed, put her glass down and sat beside the contrite drone.</P>
<P>"I am so sorry, I'm so sorry, you must know how sorry I am," Seven clasped B'Elanna's hands in her own, not even realising that for the second time that day she had used a contraction in her speech. The tears were running down her face unheeded.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked into Seven's eyes and the pain that she hid in engineering was clear.</P>
<P>"Seven I know you're sorry and I accept your apology, but you have to understand something." She raised her hand to wipe away the tears.</P>
<P>"You are stronger than me, you always will be, and even though I know and I understand that these emotions are new to you, you will need to handle them better. I promise I'll help you with that." She put her hands on either side of Seven's face and brought it close to hers. </P>
<P>"If you ever hit me again, I will never, ever forgive you." She stared deep into Seven's eyes to make sure that she understood. "Do you understand what I'm saying, Seven?"</P>
<P>Seven swallowed hard and nodded, the utter contempt and shame that bound her chest like a vice loosened, ever so slightly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna finally smiled gently, sadly and pulled Seven close and rocked her gently as she sobbed into the Klingon's shoulder.</P>
<P>Exhausted Seven fell into a fitfully sleep her head resting comfortably on B'Elanna's lap. </P>
<I>
<P>Where do we go from here? Can I really allow myself to love her? Will she be able to</I> <I>handle it?</I> There was a jumble of thoughts running through B'Elanna's head as she stroked the blond hair splayed out on her lap. She smiled slightly as she glanced at the gifts her lover had brought her. She picked up the data padd and read the words.</P>
<P><I>There's no words to say<BR>
No words to convey<BR>
This feeling inside I have for you<BR>
Deep in my heart<BR>
Safe from the guards <BR>
Of intellect and reason<BR>
Leaving me at a loss<BR>
For words to express my feelings<BR>
Deep in my heart<BR>
Look at me losing control<BR>
Thinking I had a hold<BR>
But with feelings this strong<BR>
I'm no longer the master <BR>
Of my emotions.</I></P>
<P>B'Elanna put the data padd down and allowed her own tears to fall.</P>
