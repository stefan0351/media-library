<!-- Bound \ Chapter 19 - Baked Kiwi Fruit Pie for Breakfast. -->

<P>B'Elanna heaved a deep sigh and opened her eyes, stretching luxuriously, She had slept like a baby and felt absolutely wonderful. She knew that her internal clock had woken her at 0600hrs, her normal rising time, but thanks to the doctors meddling, she wasn't on duty for another 4 hours. She decided to rise and have breakfast with her friends. </P>
<P>She also wanted to see Seven. She had come to terms with the fact that she was falling for the enigmatic Borg. Even though she had never considered a relationship with a woman before, somehow the idea of her and Seven together seemed right. Always supposing the Borg was actually interested ....B'Elanna sat up in bed and frowned. Fragments of dreams were coming back as she thought of Seven. She had been dreaming of Seven again.</P>
<P>She got out of bed grinning slightly. Jeez, I've got it bad. These dreams had been intensely erotic and B'Elanna felt her body tingle all over as she took a shower. She closed her eyes and tried to recall the details of the dream, but it all she came up with were tiny shreds of memory, sensations and flavours, all of them making her heart race.</P>
<P>She and Seven could be compatible, B'Elanna thought as she changed into her uniform, they had become pretty good friends, they shared many interests outside work and they were a brilliant team. Sure, they still had their arguments, but not the viscous hurtful fights of the past.</P>
<P>They really could make it work.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at her reflection as she prepared to leave for the mess hall. She rubbed her ridges, the way she always did when she was unsure of herself or agitated.</P>
<P>"What's the worse that could happen?" she asked the woman staring back at her from the mirror.</P>
<P>The worse that could happen would be Seven saying that she didn't want or need B'Elanna. She closed her eyes for a second, she had actually felt a physical pain at the thought of Seven not returning her affection.</P>
<P>Maybe if I take it real slow with her, not rush her into anything, she could get used to the idea. B'Elanna felt better now that she had a plan of sorts.</P>
<P>The more that she thought about Seven, the more she wanted to see her, to be close to her.</P>
<P>B'Elanna entered the mess hall and quickly found Tom and Harry.</P>
<P>"Hi guys," B'Elanna took a sat beside Harry and began to eat.</P>
<P>"Hey, B'Elanna," Tom greeted her. He looked at her plate and frowned, "What the hell are you eating?"</P>
<P>"Baked Kiwi-fruit pie," she mumbled her mouth full. B'Elanna closed her eyes and savoured the sweet, slightly tart taste of the kiwi fruit, it melted on her tongue and reminded her of something she couldn't quite place her finger on. She leaned back in her chair and growled in pleasure, her toes curling with the sheer enjoyment of the fruit.</P>
<P>"For breakfast??" Harry was a bit surprised. </P>
<P>B'Elanna opened her eyes and looked at the two men staring at her.</P>
<P>"Are you feeling alright, B'Elanna?" Tom was concerned.</P>
<P>"I'm fine. I just had this incredible craving for kiwis this morning. It tastes soo good."</P>
<P>"I'm sure. But for breakfast?" Harry was still sceptical.</P>
<P>"Anyway, what brought this craving on," Tom asked curious.</P>
<P>B'Elanna ignored them for a few minutes as she ate her dessert breakfast. She sighed in pleasure as another morsel slid down her throat and shuddered deliciously.</P>
<P>"I don't know, I was thinking of ..." She stopped as she realised that she had been thinking of Seven and those supercharged dreams of her ravishing Seven's long-limb body.</P>
<P>"I don't know what brought the craving on ..." Even as she spoke, Seven walked into the mess hall and made a beeline for their table.</P>
<P>B'Elanna dropped her fork as one or two fragments came together. She suddenly realised why she wanted the kiwi fruit so much. In her dream, she explored every intimate secret and had tasted every last inch of Seven's body. That tall, supple and incredibly beautiful body had tasted like sweet, ripe kiwi fruit.</P>
<P>She dropped her eyes, blushing violently as the Borg approached the table. If Seven could read my mind, she would run a mile. B'Elanna thought. I need to keep my lust under control. I don't want to scare her.</P>
<P>As Seven moved closer to the trio, her Borg-enhanced sense of smell detected B'Elanna's immediate arousal at her presence and she hid a small smile. Her own body responded instantly. She still ached and trembled from the loving that she had received the night before.</P>
<P>She had been shocked to find that she hadn't woken up when B'Elanna left, her body and senses completely sated by the thoroughness of B'Elanna's lovemaking. Somehow the engineer's extraordinary brain had managed to return her to her quarters unaided. </P>
<P>Seven glanced at the bruise on her inner wrist, discreetly hidden by her biosuit. She rubbed the mark with her thumb, a faint smile playing on her lips as she recalled again the manner in which B'Elanna had claimed her.</P>
<P>"Good morning," Seven greeted them all politely, but her eyes were fixed on the engineer. The guys tactfully made their excuses and quickly left, helping Seven in any way they could to bring her and B'Elanna back together again.</P>
<P>The minute B'Elanna looked up into Seven's eyes, her courage left her. The pain she had felt at the thought of Seven not returning her feeling came back, tenfold and made her feel empty and sick.</P>
<I>
<P>You need to do something. You can't just wallow in ignorance, you have to try.</I> B'Elanna said all these things to herself trying to work up the courage to tell Seven of her feelings.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, how are you feeling this morning?" Seven asked gently. She had spoken to the doctor of her intentions, and though he wasn't exactly pleased, he had assured her that B'Elanna was now pretty much emotionally strong enough to handle it.</P>
<P>"I'm fine, thanks." The Klingon forced herself to look into Seven's crystal blue eyes and clearly read the tenderness and concern in them.</P>
<P>"I spoke to the doctor, to request more information on the act of sleepwalking."</P>
<P>"Oh?" B'Elanna was a little distracted. She wanted to put her mouth on Seven's skin to see if it tasted like kiwi fruit.</P>
<P>"He tells me that sleepwalking is the sole manifestation of the subconscious carrying out actions that the conscious mind has inhibited the body from completing for some reason." Seven explained carefully, the doctor had told her that B'Elanna's memory of the night before might actually come back with very gentle prodding, unlike the memories affected by her brain surgery.</P>
<P>"How do you mean?" B'Elanna frowned not completely following. She absently noted that Seven kept rubbing her inner wrist. The action brought a vague memory to B'Elanna, something ...</P>
<P>"The night that you corrected the warp nacelles, you would have performed this duty normally if the corrections were required while you were at engineering, however, the malfunction occurred while you were asleep and your subconscious mind knew that it was important to you. Hence the trip to engineering in you night attire. Behaviour patterns displayed during sleepwalking episodes are actions that the mind is desperate to complete while awake."</P>
<P>"Seven, what are you trying to tell me," B'Elanna was trying to read between the lines.</P>
<P>"What else did I do while sleepwalking that night."</P>
<P>"You did nothing."</P>
<P>"Then why are you telling me this, I've been sleepwalking again, haven't I?"</P>
<P>Seven hesitated, B'Elanna was becoming agitated, but the engineer caught the pause.</P>
<P>"Seven, tell me. What have I done? Have I hurt someone," She grabbed at Seven's wrist trying to see </P>
<P>"Have I hurt you, Seven? Please tell me."</P>
<P>"You did not hurt me, B'Elanna." Seven responded quietly.</P>
<P>As B'Elanna stared at the bruise, she could clearly detect the bite marks. She dropped the hand as if burnt and turned grey. The memory of last night came flooding back.  It hadn't been a dream.</P>
<P>"Oh God, Seven. What have I done." She whispered brokenly. She was close to tears at the thought that she may have assaulted ... raped Seven.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, look at me," Seven instructed firmly, it was imperative that the Klingon understood that her lovemaking had not been unwelcome. Hell, it had been gratefully received.  </P>
<P>B'Elanna, her eyes filled with tears, attempted to leave the table, sickened at her actions but Seven grasped her hands and pulled her back down. She held on firmly, her piercing blue gaze forcing B'Elanna to keep eye contact.</P>
<P>"You did not hurt me, B'Elanna. You could never hurt me." Seven began caress the smaller brown hands within her larger pale ones.</P>
<P>"Your subconscious simply led you to me because it was necessary for your continued well being."</P>
<P>"I didn't hurt you?" B'Elanna could barely take it all in. The only thing that mattered was that she hadn't hurt the beautiful precious woman sitting in front on her, holding her hands tenderly.</P>
<P>"No, you did not hurt me. My only regret is that you were not fully awake to share the experience with me. I could not reciprocate my love to you while you were still unconscious. Do you understand me B'Elanna? Last night you gave me more joy than I thought possible for one person to withstand. You made me complete. You made me a woman."</P>
<P>They stared at each other, both filled with turbulent emotions, unable to speak.</P>

<P>"Janeway to Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>Seven groaned out loud at the interruption.</P>
<P>"Seven here, Captain."</P>
<P>"We're approaching the co-ordinates of the outer region of the temporal currents, Seven. We should be there in another hour, however, Tuvok tells me it would be inadvisable to take Voyager any closer, but a modified shuttle would be in no danger. How about it?"</P>
<P>"A wise precaution, Tuvok is correct. I will work with Lieutenant Torres to make the necessary modifications."</P>
<P>"Good idea. Let me know when you are ready to launch. You can choose your away team. Janeway out."</P>
<P>Seven looked at B'Elanna carefully, she appeared a little shell-shocked, but the haunted, sickened expression had left her eyes. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna there is nothing to worry about. You don't have to say anything. I told you, I am willing to wait forever." She stood and looked down at the engineer, smiling gently.</P>
<P>"I will meet you in the shuttle bay to conduct the modifications." B'Elanna looked up at her without responding.</P>
<P>"Is that acceptable, B'Elanna?" Seven's smile widened at B'Elanna's uncharacteristic silence.</P>
<P>The engineer nodded, still unable to speak. Seven nodded and turned and walked away.</P>
<P>B'Elanna slumped in her chair, her mind couldn't process all the information she had just received. </P>
<P>Just calm down, she told herself. Try and get through the day and speak to Seven when she gets back from the away mission. She'll be gone for a couple of hours and you can compose yourself and behave like an adult and tell her how much she means to you. And this time you can try doing it while you're awake, you pa'taq. She shook her head slightly, bemused at the thought that she had ravished Seven's body in her sleep. She shrugged philosophically; at least she knew what was important in life, Seven and Voyager's engines.</P>
