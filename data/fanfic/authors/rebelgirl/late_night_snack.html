<p>&quot;There must be <i>something</i> here you like,&quot; came a muffled voice from
inside the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Seven looked on, bemused by B'Elanna's actions. She had been quite content
to remain in the Chief Engineer's quarters and continue her mapping of
the darker woman's body, but B'Elanna had interrupted her exploration after
declaring that she was hungry.</p>
<p>&quot;What exactly are you looking for, B'Elanna?&quot; Seven enquired, mindful
of the lateness of the hour and their current state of dress, or more accurately,
undress. B'Elanna had flown out of her quarters with just a bathrobe tied
round her. Due to the speed of her departure, Seven had grabbed the closest
article of clothing to hand. It turned out to be one of B'Elanna's t-shirts
and just about covered her hips. The appropriateness of their attire might
come into question if they were discovered by a security patrol.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I've got what I want,&quot; B'Elanna said cryptically. &quot;Now, tell me
what do you like to eat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You,&quot; answered the drone in a blatant come-on.</p>
<p>B'Elanna hit her head on the roof of the fridge as she pulled out. &quot;I
know that,&quot; she replied with an evil grin. &quot;You must have a favourite flavour
though,&quot; she reasoned, determined to get Seven in on her idea.</p>
<p>&quot;You,&quot; Seven repeated seductively, draping her arms over the smaller
woman and claiming her lips in a bruising kiss.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't help but respond. As Seven lifted her arms to encircle
the engineer, her t-shirt had lifted, revealing intimate areas of flesh
that B'Elanna never tired of exploring. Summoning every micron of willpower,
the Klingon pulled her lips away from Seven, stroking her face tenderly
as she spoke. &quot;Your favourite food?&quot; she prompted.</p>
<p>&quot;I had strawberries a few days ago. Though sweet, there was a pleasant
tartness to them. They have an acceptable flavour,&quot; Seven responded, the
sentence punctuated by fleeting kisses on B'Elanna's brow ridges before
Seven finally secured her lips back where they wanted to be; on the shorter
woman's full mouth.</p>
<p>B'Elanna melted into the caress, feeling her hearts pound in her ears
and at a lower juncture as her desire escalated. She broke off the encounter
with a slight shove and rummaged through the kitchen refrigerator again,
triumphantly exclaiming when she targeted in on her booty.</p>
<p>Grabbing Seven's hand, she kicked the fridge door shut and headed back
to her quarters, the contraband held firmly in her other hand.</p>

<p align=center><br>* * *</p>

<p><br>Without waiting for the doors to close shut behind them, Seven pulled
B'Elanna into her arms again. She wanted this fiery engineer, and she wanted
her now.</p>
<p>Enveloping her into her arms, Seven crushed her lips down onto the smaller
woman's mouth and used her tongue to demand entrance. B'Elanna happily
obliged, draping her arms over the shoulders of the blonde amazon, careful
though to keep hold of her smuggled goods. Within seconds, B'Elanna had
forgotten about what she was holding, consumed by Seven's ardour as the
younger woman continued to ravish her mouth and body, hands raking over
her back before roaming round the front and into the opening of her bath
robe.</p>
<p>Seven moaned as her hands brushed against B'Elanna's breasts and instinctively
she massaged them, circling the dark nipples roughly, teasing the pebbles
into painful tautness.</p>
<p>Moving her head down, she kissed each of the nipples almost reverently
before locking onto one and sucking harder, grazing it with her teeth and
nipping it, stimulating B'Elanna and herself with the contact. She grinned
as she heard her lover groan and wrapped her arms round the engineer's
waist, knowing that B'Elanna's legs would give way any second.</p>
<p>The movement was enough to spur B'Elanna into action and she pulled
away from Seven's intimate caresses. &quot;Bed,&quot; she ordered, the impish grin
returning as she drew Seven's attention to the foodstuffs in her hands.</p>
<p>Confused but obliging as ever, Seven allowed herself to be led into
the bedroom, the crumpled sheets evidence of their earlier activities.</p>
<p>Slowly, B'Elanna eased Seven into the middle of the mattress and then
straddled her, shrugging off the bathrobe as she did so. Seven's hands
rose automatically to claim the klingon's breasts once more and B'Elanna
arched at the contact. Seven could feel B'Elanna's wetness on her stomach
and her own readiness increased as she became more excited. She wriggled
underneath the woman, wanting her touches to become more intimate and more
stimulating.</p>
<p>B'Elanna grinned and brought her head down to kiss the ex-drone passionately,
spurred on as Seven's hands clenched at her breasts convulsively. Slowly,
she slid down her lover, extricating the t-shirt over Seven's head to reveal
her voluptuous breasts. She traced intricate patterns in the flesh, and
danced her fingertips over the rosy aureoles, making them stiff with ardour
before sliding her sex down the alabaster skin of Seven's abdomen and then
further down her right thigh, leaving Seven gasping in ragged breaths.
When her head was parallel with her intended destination, she lowered herself
down slowly and gently blew at the downy fuzz covering Seven's mons. Seven's
hips rose up, wanting physical contact with B'Elanna but settled back down
as B'Elanna pushed them gently, opening her legs further as she did.</p>
<p>Seven laid back, feeling the cooler air on the molten folds, knowing
that B'Elanna's lips were about to consume her totally when suddenly, a
substance neither solid nor liquid, yet extremely cold landed on her most
intimate flesh. She let out a startled squeal and started to sit up when
B'Elanna attacked her flesh, licking the cold substance voraciously from
where it had spread. The heat of B'Elanna's mouth contrasted starkly with
the substance that was now starting to trickle deep into her and Seven
found herself totally aroused by the attention.</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't let up, the mixture of the banana ice-cream and Seven's
unique taste spurring her into obtaining every droplet of moisture as she
licked deep into Seven's folds and below, cleaning her thoroughly. She
could hear Seven moaning softly, regularly, as she made contact with her
flesh and lapped up more of Seven's juices as they escaped her. Continuing
her efforts, she waited until Seven was teetering on the edge before dropping
another splodge of banana ice cream onto her, once again attacking the
area, eating into the mixture of ice cream and Seven, feeling her own pulse
racing as her lover reacted to her caress, and smothering a smirk as she
heard Seven's shriek of surprise as the coldness hit her again.</p>
<p>Seven was close, so close that she thought she might stop breathing
altogether. Her hips had a life of their own as they gyrated with the rhythm
of B'Elanna's tongue. She was expecting another blast of coldness as she
teetered on the brink again. Then she yelled, B'Elanna's name torn from
her throat as her lover took her over the edge and brought her to a crashing
orgasm.</p>
<p>B'Elanna crawled up to face her partner, watching in awed amazement
as Seven panted, a fine sheen of perspiration covering the porcelain skin
and darkening her golden hair. The ex-borg's beauty never failed to astound
B'Elanna; she could study her for an eternity and still be astonished by
it.</p>
<p>After a moment of satiated silence, Seven turned her head to gaze deeply
into the smouldering brown eyes of her mate. &quot;That was incredible. Now
I know why you were so eager to get something to eat.&quot; Her voice was breathy,
indication that she was still coming down from the heights B'Elanna had
sent her to.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled lovingly at Seven. &quot;Well you certainly fed my appetite,&quot;
she quipped, trailing a finger over the optical implant adorning Seven's
face, knowing how sensitive that part of the ex-drone was.</p>
<p>Seven smiled back before leaning into B'Elanna and pushing her onto
her back. She kissed her chastely before rising onto her elbows to look
down at the smaller woman. &quot;Well I'm hungry now,&quot; Seven told her, lowering
her lips back down to nuzzle B'Elanna's neck, driving her crazy at the
contact.</p>
<p>Seven took her time with B'Elanna's body, kissing her neck thoroughly,
and marking the klingon once again in a spot that would not be seen when
the engineer was back in uniform. B'Elanna growled at the contact, her
pulse thundering through her ears, her body hypersensitive to Seven's ministrations.</p>
<p>Slowly, Seven worked her way down and onto B'Elanna's breasts. She could
feel her own excitement build again and this spurred her on further. She
marvelled at the soft flesh and attended the breasts lovingly. They grew
dark as her lips coaxed more blood towards the surface of B'Elanna's skin
and Seven lavished her tongue over the tight pebbles, swirling round them
before teasing each one with her teeth.</p>
<p>She moved further down and caressed B'Elanna's tight abdomen, feeling
the sinewy musculature underneath the soft tissue. She rolled her tongue
round B'Elanna's navel, knowing how crazy it sent her, giggling softly
as she heard a frustrated growl emanate from the engineer's lips.</p>
<p>As she descended further, she draped one hand over the side of the bed
and located the strawberries. She took a large ripe fruit, removed the
stem and then pushed it slowly into B'Elanna's opening. Once embedded,
Seven lowered her head and proceeded to suck at the area, occasionally
licking around the folds as B'Elanna's juices overflowed at the attention.
Forcefully, Seven worked the fruit out and managed to get her tongue around
it, at first, pushing it back in before deftly ensnaring the strawberry
and freeing it from B'Elanna and savouring it's tart flavour before imbedding
another strawberry and repeating the process.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was howling at the attention. Seven's tongue and the strawberries
were driving her wild with excitement. She could feel her juices coating
her thighs only to be lapped up by Seven before more fruit was pushed into
her, only to be released by Seven's tongue, teeth and now her fingers as
she probed deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Seven decided that strawberries truly were her favourite food, after
B'Elanna. The more adept and confident she got at extricating the fruit,
the further in she would push the next one, relishing every bucking movement
B'Elanna made, knowing that she was beyond control. Hearing her lover's
breathing becoming more and more stilted, Seven finally took her over into
release and lavished attention purely on B'Elanna's folds with her tongue,
adding a finger to stimulate the klingon's swollen nerve bud.</p>
<p>B'Elanna yelled as she came, bucking uncontrollably as Seven probed
her again and again with her deft tongue and fingers. She came again quickly
a second time and marvelled at the skill of her lover, even as her body
ached for a third orgasm.</p>
<p>Seven obliged, knowing B'Elanna's reactions as well as she knew her
own. She brought the dark-haired woman back down gently, stroking her thighs
and abdomen softly before sliding back up the bed to nestle into B'Elanna's
waiting arms.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stroked one of Seven's arms lightly, still trying to get her
breathing back into a more regular pattern. Eventually she found her voice.
&quot;Now I really AM hungry.&quot;</p>
