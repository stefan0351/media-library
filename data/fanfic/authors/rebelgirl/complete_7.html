<!-- Complete \ Part 7 -->

<p>As the two women materialised in Sick Bay, the Doctor sprang from his office. "Is this a medical emergency or a clothing emergency?" he asked acerbically, noting their nudity.</p>
<p>"Doctor," warned Seven, the anger blazing in her eyes.</p>
<P>Moving to one side to allow the Doctor to approach, he forgot any further comments as he saw that the dark Klingon was still convulsing.</p>
<p>"That’s impossible," he protested, his hands dancing rapidly over a console. "Her cortical monitor is reading normal."</p>
<p>"Treat the patient not the monitor," reminded Seven sharply. Her voice was now rough with emotion as she tried to keep herself together. She was angry for being unable to help her lover herself there was only the Doctor to direct her feelings at.. She concentrated on the task at hand and somehow managed to get the jerking woman into her arms and lift her onto a nearby bio-bed.</p>
<p>Switching to strict professional mode, the EMH prepared a hypospray and began treatment. "Seven, there’s a locker over there. You might want to put a robe on," he suggested absently as he watched the convulsing engineer. Making adjustments on the wedge top of the hypospray, he administered a second dose into the woman’s neck before looking anxiously at his medical tricorder. </p>
<p>Seven ignored his comment. There was no way she was going to leave B’Elanna’s side now, not even for an instant. She felt the hot sting of tears burn her eyes and allowed them to collect on her lashes, the drops building before gravity claimed them and they began to run freely down her burning cheeks. Her stomach contracted and her throat felt raw. Why wasn’t B’Elanna responding?</p>
<p>The Doctor, sensing that he would have to sedate Seven before removing her from Sick Bay, decided to leave her where she stood and worked around her. Frantically, he collated data from the scans he performed, trying to determine the source of the problem, looking up worriedly at the fitting Klingon periodically. He stopped for a fraction, trying to make up his mind over the next course of action. Resolution reconciled itself across his craggy features and he administered a third dose from the hypospray. Finally, the engineer stopped thrashing and lay still on the bio-bed. </p>
<p>Seven let out pent-up breath and roughly wiped her face clear of tears, sniffing repeatedly.</p>
<p>The Doctor, feeling safer with B’Elanna’s paroxysm under control, was confident enough to resume his normal demeanour. "If you had a robe on, you could<BR>use the cuff to wipe your nose."</P>
<P>This time, Seven took the hint, belatedly realising that despite the EMH was quite used to seeing anatomical bodies, it was somewhat unnerving for him to see both B’Elanna and herself in a state of undress. She grabbed a blue silk robe from the locker and another for B’Elanna.</p>
<p>The Doctor looked up, viewing her blotchy tear-stained face with compassion. "Seven, before you ask, I don’t know what’s wrong yet. I’ve rendered her unconscious to minimalise oxygen deprivation. I can now perform some tests safely. Once I’ve got those results, I’ll need to wake her and perform more tests." He stopped as he watched the tall blonde nod glumly, a look of guilt written plainly over her face as she covered the unconscious Klingon.</p>
<p>"Don’t blame yourself Seven," the Doctor advised gently. "It won’t help B’Elanna." </p>
<p>His words provoked Seven to look at him quickly. "She did not suffer seizures before performing the cortical suppressor modifications Doctor," she reminded him, her voice dull. "I am fully aware of who is culpable for her current state." She sniffed again suddenly and then rubbed her sleeve along the bottom of her nose.</p>
<p>The Doctor sighed. He was decidedly uncomfortable at Seven’s state. Hours before, she had the luxury of never having to deal with such deep emotions. It was all very well wanting to feel love and wanting to be in love, but the emotions involved with that state were not always happy. For every extreme of bliss, there could be equal measures of guilt, jealousy and insecurity. Seven was having to deal with these extremes without the one person the Doctor now believed might guide her. He regarded both Seven and B’Elanna as personal friends and had seen their friendship deepen significantly over the last two weeks. He wanted them to be happy. The EMH turned his thoughts back to the task at hand and began to sift through the data.</p>
<p>Seven tried to still her emotions but found herself firmly in their clutches. The time she had spent in B’Elanna’s quarters untethered her feelings for the Klingon hybrid. She had declared her love for the raven-haired woman and had heard the words returned to her. The paradox of the situation made the ex-drone’s heart ache. She had never felt such depth of emotion until B’Elanna had stymied the cortical inhibitor. The close work finding a solution to the problem had allowed them both to recognise and accept the feelings they shared. Now, the process could permanently affect B’Elanna. </p>
<p>The tall Astrometrics Officer's mind was in turmoil. She felt foolish for not considering how *all* her emotions might amplify once the inhibitor had been<BR>removed, guilt included. It was a decidedly unpleasant side-effect of the depth of feeling she had for B'Elanna. It was something she would have to deal with later though because dwelling on these sensations now, would not help the Chief Engineer.</p>
<p>Taking several shuddering breaths, she found a new focus and gently removed the cortical monitor from behind the unconscious woman’s ear, placing it on a workstation. The Doctor had said that it had shown normal readings. Recalling earlier events, Tom Paris had stated that his tricorder displayed normal parameters the first time B’Elanna reacted. </p>
<P>Was there a connection or was it purely coincidence?</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye, the doctor saw Seven move to a console and begin work. He nodded in satisfaction.</P>
<P>The doors to Sick Bay hissed open and Captain Janeway strode in. She had heard the emergency transmission and came down to check on her Engineering Chief. </p>
<p>"Doctor, what’s wrong with her?" she asked without preamble, even as her eyebrows raised slightly at seeing Seven standing at a console wearing a short robe instead of her normal bio-suit.</p>
<p>"That’s what I’m trying to determine," the EMH replied testily. There was a perfectly good communications system in place. Why did the Captain insist on checking in person?</p>
<p>"Perhaps I should re-phrase that," Janeway remarked. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"B’Elanna suffered another seizure," answered Seven from her console. "I was with her so transported straight here." For a reason that escaped her for the time being, Seven felt reluctant to go into details about her relationship with B’Elanna.<br>Not until she was well enough to share the telling perhaps.</p>
<p>Janeway looked at Seven through narrowed thoughtful eyes. There was more behind this episode, but now was not the time or place to delve deeper. "Perhaps we should leave the Doctor to his tests?" she suggested.</p>
<p>"I am not leaving Sick Bay yet. I have tests of my own to run." Seven didn’t look up as she spoke, running a correlative set of analyses.</P>
<p>The Captain tried again. "Seven, you’re still tired after the procedure. You shouldn’t be working."</p>
<p>Seven’s eyes came up to meet the Captain’s with a blaze of fury. Remarkably, she held control of her voice and her tone remained cool as she replied. "Captain, I am well aware of my own condition. However it is not I who lies sedated on a bio-bed. I need to do this."</p>
<p>The Captain blanched at the vitriol lacing Seven’s words. However, it had taken years of training to become a Starfleet captain and she was well used to the arguments of her crew now. "Seven, if you overwork yourself now, what use will you be to B’Elanna when she wakes? You need time to recover," she reminded the ex-drone.</p>
<p>"If I am overwhelmed by my exertions then I am in the right location for treatment," Seven rebutted logically.</p>
<p>"And you’ll succeed in diverting the Doctor from treating B’Elanna," riposted Janeway.</p>
<p>"Then assign Mr Paris to Sick Bay," snapped Seven, tired of the manipulation the Captain was attempting. "I am staying here," she stated with finality.</p>
<p>Realising she’d get no further with Seven, Janeway turned to the Doctor. "Are you happy for Seven to remain here?" she asked.</P>
<p>"I agree that she needs to regenerate Captain," the Doctor answered. "But I suspect that she has higher priorities at this time and I have no objection to her working on them," he continued cryptically.</p>
<p>Seven looked up gratefully and gave a tiny nod towards the physician, indicating her thanks for his understanding. Janeway noticed the gesture and finally comprehended the dynamic between the ex-drone and her Chief Engineer. Disgusted with the burning jealousy she felt toward the unconscious Klingon, the Captain decided that it was time to retreat.</p>
<p>"Keep me informed Doctor," she advised before leaving, barely sparing a glance for Seven.</p>
<p>The EMH and Seven worked on their own tasks in silence but Sick Bay gave out reassuring beeps from the devices monitoring B’Elanna and Seven found herself registering every sound as she continued to plough through the data, looking for anything that might help her stricken lover.</p>
<p>"Seven, I’m going to wake B’Elanna now," the Doctor advised, startling her out of her study. She nodded and approached the bio-bed, grasping B’Elanna’s hand in both of hers.</p>
<p>The EMH placed the hypospray at B’Elanna’s neck and injected its contents. For a second, nothing happened. Then the dark lashes fluttered and B’Elanna opened her eyes hesitantly. She turned her head slightly to focus on the woman squeezing her hand tightly.</p>
<p>"Hi," she began softly, smiling weakly. </p>
<p>The single word brought tears to Seven’s eyes but she blinked them back rapidly as she returned the greeting, her voice hoarse with emotion. "I’m sorry B’Elanna."</p>
<p>A look of confusion stole across the dark engineer’s face. "What happened?" she asked, glancing back towards the Doctor.</p>
<p>"You suffered another seizure B’Elanna," the EMH supplied. "I don’t know why yet. I ran a set of tests while you were sedated but I need to do some comparative analyses while you’re conscious. Hopefully, with those results we can work out what’s going on and do something about it," he continued softly.</p>
<p>"So I’m stuck in Sick Bay then?" she asked resignedly.</p>
<p>"For the time being, yes," he replied.</P>
<p>B’Elanna turned back to Seven as she felt the pressure on her hand increasing. "Why are you sorry?" she asked the tall blonde, placing her other hand over Seven’s.</p>
<p>"If I had not proceeded with this project, you would not be in this predicament," Seven replied brokenly, overwrought.</p>
<p>"Shhhh sweetheart, don’t blame yourself," soothed the recumbent engineer. "I told you from the start that I was prepared to do this for you."</p>
<p>"You are injured, B’Elanna," Seven protested. "Perhaps permanently."</p>
<p>"Well let’s wait and see on that one. Don’t you realise that I would have done this regardless of the risk? I’ve loved you far longer than since this project began." B’Elanna only realised as the words came out how true they really were. She smiled warmly at Seven.</p>
<p>"I cannot say the same simply because of the inhibitor B’Elanna," replied Seven apologetically. "But if it’s any consolation, I can find no adverb to describe the<BR>depth of love I feel for you now. I just hope that we can continue to share and explore those depths," she finished poetically, drawing a tear from B’Elanna’s eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh we will, honey, we will," the raven-haired engineer reassured her.</p>
<p>"Touching though this scene is," the Doctor interrupted, "I still have work to do," he explained as two pairs of irritated eyes scorched him.</p>
<p>Seven nodded in understanding. "I need to finish my analysis too," she stated. She squeezed her lover’s hands tightly. "I’ll only be at the other console," she reassured. </p>
<p>B’Elanna smiled and then frowned as she thought on what had been said. "Is there anything I can do to help?"</p>
<p>"No!" Seven and the Doctor replied in unison. B’Elanna pulled a face and was about to protest when she realised that she was outnumbered. She realised that she felt exhausted so settled back and allowed her eyes to close while she listened to the other occupants of Sick Bay bustling around. The Doctor prodded her unceremoniously and she opened one eye irritably.</p>
<p>"What?" </p>
<p>"I wanted you awake for these tests," the EMH reminded her shortly. Grumbling, B’Elanna adjusted position slightly, knowing that if she stayed in a more uncomfortable position she was less likely to drop off. It also gave her the opportunity to gaze at Seven and for that, she was thankful. Her heart quickened as she watched the tall blonde’s graceful movements, the barest trace of a frown furrowing her forehead.</p>
<p>"Not that my opinion ever counted for much, but I think you suit each other perfectly," the Doctor whispered in her ear discretely, making B’Elanna flush to her hairline.</p>
<p>"Thanks Doc, I appreciate it," she smiled back at him.</p>
<p>"As do I," agreed Seven and then quirked her eybrow toward the Doctor, earning a snort of laughter from B’Elanna and an aggrieved grunt from the EMH as he continued with the tests.</p>
<p>"I still can’t work out why your monitor failed to warn me that anything was wrong," the Doctor commented conversationally as he worked his console.</p>
<p>"I am trying to ascertain if there is a link between that and Mr Paris’ tricorder readings," Seven told him from where she stood.</p>
<p>"Do you think it might have something to do with it getting wet?" asked B’Elanna sheepishly.</p>
<p>"What?" exploded the Doctor in disbelief. </p>
<p>"I took a shower and I didn’t want to take the monitor off," explained B’Elanna hurriedly, cringing at the EMH’s reaction.</p>
<p>"Well that’s got to go down in the Ship’s Log," retorted the Doctor sarcastically. "Since when did delicate scientific monitoring equipment like getting wet?"</p>
<p>"Oh come on Doc," protested B’Elanna. "That stuff ought to be impervious to all sorts of nastiness."</p>
<p>"Do not worry B’Elanna, the monitor is functioning correctly," interjected Seven. She looked up sadly at both of her companions. "I’m afraid I have an answer to your predicament," she stated in a dull voice.</p>
<p>The Doctor left B’Elanna and joined Seven at her console, looking at her data quickly. B’Elanna, frightened by Seven’s tone did not want to go over there and remained paralysed on the bio-bed. She watched carefully as she saw the EMH look up to glance at her before returning his eyes to the screen. She noted how still Seven stood, waiting for a reaction from the Doctor, her azure eyes darting between him and B’Elanna rapidly.</p>
<p>The Doctor rubbed his face with his hands as he thought about what he’d just read. He then walked back to B’Elanna’s bed and looked at her carefully. "It seems that our Borg nanoprobes have a sense of irony," he began.</p>
<p>"Just tell me Doc," instructed B’Elanna, sitting up and pulling her robe tightly round her.</p>
<p>"During your link-up, it would appear the nanoprobes analysed your own neural readings and have somehow tampered with the synaptic pathways. The alterations<BR>trigger a cascade failure of the junctions whenever there is a build up of certain chemicals in your body."</p>
<p>"Which chemicals?" B’Elanna asked, a sense of dread creeping over her.</p>
<p>The Doctor sighed. "I can’t be certain without further testing, but adrenaline and noradrenaline seem to be favourites at the moment," the EMH replied. "There may be others," he added.</p>
<p>B’Elanna laughed mirthlessly. "Talk about cripple a Klingon," she remarked. "So what’s the prognosis?" she pursued, her pragmatism taking control.</p>
<p>"Again, difficult to tell at this early stage," the Doctor hedged.</p>
<p>B’Elanna flicked her eyes over to where Seven stood, watching the exchange nervously. She smiled at her shyly. "I could use a hug," she suggested softly. </p>
<p>Seven sprang to the dark woman’s side and pulled her into a fierce hold.</p>
<p>"Don’t stay away from me now Seven," B’Elanna whispered into the distraught woman’s hair. "I need your help."</p>
<p>Seven squeezed her tighter, signifying her understanding. "I love you," she whispered back.</p>
