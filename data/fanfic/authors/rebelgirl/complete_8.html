<!-- Complete \ Part 8 -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway pinched the bridge of her nose with her right hand and squeezed her eyes tight as she allowed herself a few moments to process the report the Doctor had delivered. Finally, she looked up at the EMH who sat opposite her in the Briefing Room, absently rotating his data padd on the table. She wondered when the hologram had decided to include fidgeting as part of his programming.</P>
<P>"Let me get this right Doctor," she began, leaning forward onto her elbows. "B’Elanna’s neural pathways have been booby-trapped by the nanoprobes so that when she generates excessive neuro-chemicals, the pathways break down and she suffers a seizure, correct?"</P>
<P>The EMH nodded in affirmation, his hands stilling.</P>
<P>"And the chemicals that the nanoprobes have used for a trigger are generated when she’s under extreme stress or emotion?" Janeway continued.</P>
<P>"Correct, Captain. Anything from an emergency in Engineering to the throes of passion." The Doctor couldn’t resist referring to Seven and B’Elanna’s relationship, knowing how much it needled Janeway.</P>
<P>The captain chose to ignore the comment and considered all the aspects of the problem. "Why did the monitor and tricorder show normal readings during these episodes?" she asked, speculating if this could perhaps generate a solution.</P>
<P>"The synapse breakdown is hidden by the forced generation of another chemical. Because of the way we scan for medical information, everything that we expect to see is there, so the problem goes undetected. It’s quite alarming to discover that an age old method of examination is intrinsically faulty," the EMH explained. "Seven has gone through all the medical instrumentation and made adjustments so that this sort of thing won’t recur."</p>
<P>Janeway tapped her lips with her index finger, an indication of the tension she felt. "So how do we resolve this?" she asked. Her eyes snapped up when the EMH failed to respond. "Doctor?"</p>
<P>"The simple answer is that I don’t know yet. The information I have is too patchy to provide exact figures or potential solutions." He fidgeted nervously in his seat, unwilling to continue.</P>
<P>"Go on," Janeway prompted, lowering her voice commandingly.</P>
<P>"Now that we can monitor B’Elanna’s condition more effectively, I may have to induce another seizure in order to obtain the data I need to provide a solution," the dark craggy hologram finished, clearly uncomfortable with the idea.</P>
<P>"Isn’t that dangerous?" Janeway sat back, the suggestion making her feel decidedly uncomfortable.</P>
<P>"Of course it’s dangerous. Every time she has a seizure, the oxygen supply to her brain is reduced, potentially risking hypoxic damage, not to mention the breakdown of her neural pathways," he retorted angrily. "Captain, I am working on ways to solve this, but you need to know that as of this moment, I’m not sure that her condition is curable."</p>
<P>Janeway stared at the EMH for a few moments, considering her options.</P>
<P>"In view of the circumstances, I’ve decided to relieve her of duty as Chief Engineer," the Captain informed him. "Knowing B’Elanna, that will be all the stimulus she needs to trigger an emotional outburst," she continued grimly.</P>
<P>"I’m not so sure, Captain. From the sketchy information I received from Seven regarding the events leading to this last episode, the term ‘extreme’ is quite accurate. I suspect that B’Elanna’s already considered the possibility of restricted duty. It might not be enough of a trigger," the Doctor disputed.</P>
<P>Janeway hid her emotions well, leaving her face a mask of neutrality as her mind considered exactly what it was that Seven and B’Elanna were doing to prompt a seizure. "What would you suggest then, an artificial increase in adrenaline?"</P>
<P>"Exactly, Captain," the EMH confirmed, impressed with the Captain’s grasp of the problem.</P>
<P>"Is she still in Sick Bay?" queried Janeway.</P>
<P>"Yes. Despite Seven’s scanning modifications, I’m not willing to take the risk and allow her to leave, not yet anyway. Besides, other than getting ‘stir-crazy’, there’s little chance of her suffering another convulsion while she remains there. I just hope Sick Bay and I can survive her prolonged stay," the Doctor finished sardonically.</P>
<P>"I ought to pay her a visit," Janeway resigned herself.</P>

<P>"It’s up to you when you want to visit Captain," the EMH replied, "but at the moment, B’Elanna is exhausted with the after-effects of her seizure and the sedative I administered. When I left to come here, she was sleeping naturally. It might not hurt to wait till morning," he suggested.</P>
<P>Janeway considered his proposal before her mind switched focus slightly. "Where’s Seven?"</P>
<P>The Doctor grimaced slightly. "After a lot of persuasion from both B’Elanna and myself, Seven has returned to her alcove to regenerate. I have no idea how long she’ll stay there but she needs at least sixteen hours," he explained. "The one consolation out of this situation is that she has no complications post-surgery. Although it is a little early to be certain, I speculate that she will recover completely and live a normal *emotional* life."</P>
<P>The Captain nodded at that. It was the least that Seven deserved and she told the EMH her sentiment.</P>
<P>"I concur, but things are more problematic now that B’Elanna has difficulties," the bald man demurred.</p>
<P>"B’Elanna isn’t the only friend Seven has on Voyager," Janeway protested. "There are a number of people she can turn to for assistance adjusting to her new emotions."</P>
<P>"Quite so, but I believe that B’Elanna is the only one she truly trusts her emotions with." The Doctor hurried on as he saw the Captain begin to object. "Seven thinks that she has already harmed B’Elanna and won’t want to put her in any further danger by bombarding her with her own emotions." The EMH sat back once he finished.</P>
<P>"All the more reason for her to approach one of her other friends then," Janeway reasoned.</P>
<P>The Doctor resisted sighing but wondered if the Captain was being deliberately obtuse about the subject.</P>
<P>"It looks like I need to pay a number of visits," Janeway continued. She glanced at the chronometer and was startled by the lateness of the hour. "Thank you Doctor," she dismissed the hologram gently. "I’ll leave B’Elanna to sleep and Seven to regenerate. I’ll visit Sick Bay in the morning. If there is any change though…"</P>
<P>"I’ll keep you apprised Captain," the EMH finished as he rose.</p>
<P>Janeway reached for her coffee cup and drained the contents, shuddering as she realised how cold the contents had become. She spun her chair round and returned the black and silver cup to the replicator and then left the Briefing Room purposefully and strode towards the turbolift.</P>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<P>Captain Janeway stood and stared at the empty alcoves for a full minute. The children were at Sam Wildman's quarters for the evening, spending time with her, Neelix and Naomi. Seven was noticeable by her absence.</P>
<P>"Computer, locate Seven of Nine," the Captain ordered.</p>
<P>"Seven of Nine is in Lieutenant B’Elanna Torres’ quarters," the disembodied voice replied unemotionally.</P>
<P>Janeway frowned and punched out another question, her heart lurching in anticipation of the answer. "Locate B’Elanna Torres."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres is in Sick Bay," the computer replied in a monotone. Janeway allowed herself to breathe again, even as her mind whirled over her next actions and their possible consequences. Resolved, she marched quickly out of Cargo Bay Two and back down the corridor towards the turbolift.</P>
<P>She pressed the door chime and waited a few seconds, astonished at how nervous she felt. When there was no answer, Janeway scanned the corridor quickly, checking for any onlookers, before bending over slightly to punch in an override code. Smartly, she stepped through the doors as they hissed open. A quick glance around the Chief Engineer’s quarters revealed little to the Captain. Everything in the living area was tidy. Once the door shut behind her, Janeway called out. "Seven?" Stepping more centrally into the room, she called the Astrometrics Officer’s name again.</P>
<P>Seven heard her name called and groaned as she forced her eyes open. Realising where she was and the owner of the voice, she decided that it would not be prudent to walk out of B’Elanna’s bedroom without clothing so she grabbed the robe that B’Elanna had discarded by the bed during their love-making and shrugged it over her shoulders. As the lithe blonde tied the black robe carefully round her waist, she caught the smell of the engineer and she paused to savour it. Closing her eyes momentarily, she pressed the material into her face, inhaling deeply.</p>
<P>Tugging the robe round her more tightly, as if it could offer protection in the same way B’Elanna could, Seven padded softly from the engineer’s bedroom to greet Janeway.</P>
<P>"Captain," she acknowledged, her tone indicating her surprise at Janeway’s presence.</P>
<P>"Sorry to disturb you Seven," Janeway began, her throat dry as she drank in the vision that stood before her. The black robe contrasted starkly with the tall woman's alabaster skin, particularly the V shaped area where the robe crossed over her breasts. It was tied in tight, highlighting the narrow waist and curvaceous hips and the shortness of the garment served to accentuate the length of Seven's legs. The younger woman's golden hair was free from its usual bindings and looked tousled and soft, and her cobalt blue eyes were puffy from sleep, yet undeniably alluring.</p>
<P>"Captain, is something wrong? Has something happened to B’Elanna?" Seven's voice increased in both volume and pitch as she asked the questions.</P>
<P>Janeway put a hand out to still the questions and responded quickly. "No, no, B’Elanna's fine. I just wanted to come and speak with you," she explained. "I think I’ll come back another time and let you get back to sleep." Janeway allowed herself a bolt-hole for escape, chastising herself for even coming here.</p>
<P>Before she moved to leave, the older woman decided to appease her curiosity, though an inner voice told her that the answer would be painful to hear. "The Doctor told me you were regenerating. Why are you sleeping in B’Elanna's quarters?"</P>
<P>Seven surprised Janeway by moving to the couch and sitting down, curling her long legs up underneath her and adjusting the short dark robe to cover herself.</p>
<P>"I returned to the Cargo Bay and spent some time with the children before regeneration. Once they were in the care of Ensign Wildman, my emotions ‘got the better of me’ and I felt the need to be close to B’Elanna." Seven swallowed before continuing, trying to reign in her emotions once again. "I came here as I did not want to disturb B’Elanna in Sick Bay. I found comfort from lying in B’Elanna’s bed so I decided to sleep here. It is a less efficient means of regeneration compared to the alcove but I found it preferable." Even as she spoke, Seven realised that it was the second night in a row that she had slept, wondering if it held any significance.</P>
<P>Janeway moved over to the couch and sat at the other end. "I’ve just had a meeting with the Doctor," she told the ex-drone carefully, keeping an expression of compassion on her face. "B’Elanna’s ‘condition’ may be incurable," she continued, watching the blonde woman’s visage intently for any expression of emotion. She was not disappointed.</p>
<P>Seven closed her eyes briefly at the statement as a pained look washed over her. "The Doctor advised me that there may be a problem, but he neglected to mention its severity," she replied, her voice barely louder than a whisper.</P>
<P>Janeway placed her hand on the Borg’s leg in a gesture of sympathy. "Seven, the next few days are going to be extremely hard on you. You’ve just been given access to all your emotions and they are going to make themselves felt, believe me." Janeway squeezed Seven’s leg gently as she continued. "Now that B’Elanna is in danger when she is dealing with extreme emotion, you need to search your own feelings about your relationship with her. Is your ‘interaction’ likely to cause more harm than good whilst she’s in this state?" She looked enquiringly at the young drone.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, B’Elanna needs me," protested Seven.</P>
<P>"Are you sure she needs all that intense emotion Seven?" Janeway asked gently. "Can you deal with the idea that your presence might put her in danger?"</P>
<P>Seven looked unblinking at her superior officer as she considered her words.</P>
<P>The Captain continued softly. "I’m here if you need support or you need to talk about anything," she offered.</P>
<P>Seven stared back dolefully. "I feel so helpless Kathryn," she whispered, allowing her eyes to fill with tears.</p>
<P>Instantly, Janeway swept the woman into her arms and hugged her tightly. "Let it go Seven," she advised as she rocked her gently. "Let it go." She felt Seven’s shoulders shudder slightly and then heave as the tears came and flooded through the distraught woman.</P>
<P>Seven felt confused and hurt. She was angry with herself for putting B’Elanna in peril but she had no one else who understood her so totally and selflessly. Her self-loathing spiralled downward. She longed to be held by B’Elanna and then berated herself for her selfishness and disregard for the well-being of the woman she loved. These emotions were raw and painful for her and tears wracked through her body. In turmoil, she hung onto the one anchor she had, Kathryn Janeway.</p>
<P>The Captain continued to hug her and stroke her back gently, uttering nonsense words to soothe and reassure the distressed woman. Softly, she stroked the long golden tresses and waited.</P>
<P>Eventually, the tears subsided but Janeway continued to hold her companion, projecting her own strength and love toward the young woman.</P>
<P>To Kathryn, it was only a natural progression to tilt the Borg’s chin up slightly so that she could look at her tear-ravaged face. As soon as she set eyes on her visage, Janeway knew that she was no longer in control of her actions and she brushed her lips across the full quivering mouth of Seven of Nine.</P>
