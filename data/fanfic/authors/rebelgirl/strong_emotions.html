<P>Lt Torres strode into Astrometrics and placed her tool kit on the floor. She
opened it and selected the instrument she required, setting to work on an access
panel. The power variance Astrometrics was using had exceeded tolerances and
after having no luck contacting Seven to investigate, the Chief Engineer decided
to look into the problem herself.</P>
<P>Quickly, she manipulated her tricorder and frowned into it whilst it scanned
for results. A stifled sob made her jump and she turned her head instantly to
identify the source of the noise. To her amazement, she saw Seven of Nine sat in
the far corner of Astrometrics, her arms hugging her knees in tight, her
tear-ravaged face distorted by crying.</P>
<P>Alarmed and distraught by the sight, the half Klingon leapt up and ran over
to where the ex drone was bundled.</P>
<P>"Seven, what’s wrong?" she asked. Seven did not respond but continued to cry,
hugging herself in even more tightly if that were at all possible.</P>
<P>Torres tried again but could not provoke a response from Seven. She wondered
about contacting the Captain or the EMH but then opted to sit next to the blonde
woman and just rubbed her hand up and down Seven’s arm in an effort to try and
soothe her and maybe calm her down.</P>
<P>Eventually the tears subsided but Seven’s distress did not appear to have
eased. She grabbed onto Torres hand and leant into the Lieutenant. Torres
reacted by wrapping her other arm round Seven and hugging her, trying to project
reassurance and protection, though from what, Torres had no idea.</P>
<P>"I am sorry, Lieutenant", Seven struggled to keep her voice under control as
her breathing was still coming in great gulps as a result to her crying. </P>
<P>"What are you sorry for, Seven?" Torres asked gently, still holding the woman
in her arms. "What’s upset you so badly and why couldn’t you tell anyone about
it?"</P>
<P>"I have made a discovery about myself, Lieutenant", Seven began but closed
her eyes, not wanting to continue. B’Elanna waited patiently, once again rubbing
Seven’s arm reassuringly and after a while Seven spoke again.</P>
<P>"The borg technology that remains inside of me prevents me from feeling
extreme emotion. I can never love nor hate anyone. I am also unable to bear
children. It seems I am destined for a life alone."</P>
<P>Torres sat back in shock. "Are you sure? No, don’t answer that. Of course
you’re sure." She looked at Seven earnestly and waited till she had her full
attention before starting again.</P>
<P>"I think you’re going to have to do some more research, Seven." Seven quirked
an eyebrow, confused.</P>
<P>"Well that was one of the most emotional displays I’ve ever been witness to.
You might not think you can experience strong emotions but I’ve just seen that
you can."</P>
<P>"That was just a selfish outburst of pity, Lieutenant", she stated, pulling
away from Torres’ embrace. "I would not consider that to be an emotion worthy of
having. Knowing that I cannot love is different altogether."</P>
<P>With that, Seven stood and composed herself. "I would be grateful if you
could keep this incident to yourself Lieutenant. I do not wish the crew to
discover that their thoughts about me are actually fact."</P>
<P>"What?" asked Torres, confused. She scrambled to get upright. "What do you
mean by that?"</P>
<P>"When I first came aboard this ship, the crew believed me to be emotionless
and sterile. Through my interactions, some have altered their opinions and
therefore their manner with me. I do not wish to return to the isolation I first
felt when leaving the Collective. I would rather that the illusion
remained."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Seven did not wait for Torres to answer but strode straight for the door and
headed to the solace of cargo bay two and regeneration.</P>
<P>Torres stared at the doors, long after they had hissed shut, pondering on
what Seven had told her. There was something intrinsically wrong with what she
had said. Focussing on what Seven had told her about her borg circuitry, the
raven-haired woman headed for Engineering to conduct a few experiments of her
own.</P>
<P>Several hours later, Torres paused outside Cargo Bay Two. Despite seeing the
results from her experiments concurring with Seven’s results, she was still far
from defeated over this.</P>
<P>Resolved, she strode through the doors and approached the tall, blonde haired
ex borg.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres", acknowledged Seven neutrally. "Seven, I’ve viewed the
data and conducted a few experiments of my own", Torres began without preamble.
"I can see why you’ve come up with your conclusions but I think you’re wrong.
You are capable of feelings and I’d like to help you realise that."</P>
<P>"There is no need, Lieutenant", Seven responded, "I am resigned to the facts
now." </P>
<P>"No," contradicted Torres angrily. "You can’t just give in to this. Examine
your time on Voyager carefully. Really think about all that you have gone
through."</P>
<P>Seven looked at Torres neutrally. "I am unwilling to, Lieutenant". She
stated. "Why, frightened that you might see that the precious Borg were wrong?"
goaded Torres, angry at Seven’s defeated acceptance to her situation.</P>
<P>"No, I am frightened that it will just confirm what I have already
extrapolated." Seven whispered.</P>
<P>"Right, then. We’ll do this together. I think you’re going to need a friend
to get you through this." Offered Torres decisively.</P>
<P>"You are not my friend, Lieutenant Torres."</P>
<P>"I am now." Torres retorted. "Right, where do you want to start?"</P>
<P>It began with the two women analysing countless log hours from the time when
Seven boarded. Every time Seven came across an entry where strong emotions might
have been used, they picked all the data through minutely, discussing every
nuance of what happened. Seven related to Torres her feelings when she had
flashbacks to The Raven, how she felt when she thought she’d been violated by a
trader and even recalled her own emotions mixed up with all her other
countenances when the vinculum had come so close to destroying her mind.</P>
<P>It took several weeks. At first, B’Elanna designated a specific time, usually
after her duty shift, to assist Seven. After a while, she dropped by to chat to
Seven at any time and they talked about other things; engineering or astrometric
projects, the interactions of other members of the crew and of her own feelings
regarding the end of her relationship with Tom Paris and the strong emotions
that she had endured.</P>
<P>For her part, Seven was enjoying Torres’ company even if the reason for her
presence was so painful. Some of her experiences she felt warranted emotion but
nothing so far had really been strong passionate wholehearted emotion. She
wasn’t sure she would ever find that but she had at least gained a true friend
in B’Elanna. She welcomed her company and missed her when she left. She
monitored her friend’s whereabouts and movements, worried if she was late for a
rendezvous and revelled in the woman’s own revelations concerning
emotions.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Torres projected herself from the turbolift and hurried to cargo bay two. She
was almost an hour late for her session with Seven because of a fractured relay
link in Jeffries tube 12. As she entered the bay she saw Seven sitting in a
corner, crying. She had a sudden flashback to the time she saw her in
Astrometrics several weeks ago and sped to her side. "Seven, what’s wrong?" </P>
<P>Seven looked up, a miserable angry look on her face. "You are late. I thought
you were not coming."</P>
<P>"Why on earth would you think that? I just got caught up in engineering.."
Any further explanation was halted as Seven reached out and grabbed B’Elanna.
She pulled her close and kissed her fiercely. B’Elanna, initially stunned by the
action, found her body reacting and her lips opened, allowing Seven to push her
tongue into her mouth and explore hungrily.</P>
<P>Torres broke off suddenly. "Whoa, whoa. Seven, what’s going on here?" she
asked breathlessly.</P>
<P>Seven, eyes full of emotion stared back at the engineer and hesitated
slightly before answering. "B’Elanna, I love you. I hate it when you aren’t
here, I count the seconds until you’re arrival and I relish every instant I am
in your company."</P>
<P>B’Elanna sat back and stared at the beautiful woman, realising that she had
just heard her own feelings put into words. She grinned ferally. "Then let’s put
your theories about extreme emotion to the test then" and with that kissed Seven
hard, forcing her tongue into the warm hollow of her mouth and tasting her
ravenously.</P>
<P>Seven responded instantly and put her arms around B’Elanna, pulling the half
Klingon as close to her as possible, wanting to touch and feel every part of the
extraordinary engineer. Having secured a firm grip, she twisted and manoeuvred
B’Elanna onto the floor, lying on top of her and still kissing deeply.</P>
<P>Torres snaked her arms up around her lover’s head and pulled at the pins
securing her hair. As the blonde tresses cascaded down, she ran both hands
through it, enjoying the soft touch and feathery tickling as it fell over her
own face.</P>
<P>Seven moved her hands gently and traced B’Elanna’s face and neck whilst still
nibbling and sucking at her lips and tongue. Reluctant to break contact, even
for a second, her lips followed the path of her hands as she caressed Torres’
face and neck, savouring her taste and scent. She buried her face into the
hollow of her neck and without thinking, bit down hard, drawing blood and an
impassioned yell from B’Elanna who arched into the pain. Using her tongue to
take the sting away from the bite, she licked the spot for some time, feeling
the smaller woman wriggle in ecstasy underneath her. Seven moved her hands lower
and encompassed B’Elanna’s breasts, squeezing them and kneading them through the
fabric of her uniform. Frustrated, and wanting to feel her skin, she moved her
hands to the zipper of the jacket and opened it. When her hands reached the
bottom of the jacket, they journeyed back up again under the t-shirt of the
engineer, feeling her hot skin react to her cooler hands until she found her
breasts again, still encased in B’Elanna’s Starfleet issue bra. Deftly, she
moved one hand behind B’Elanna and sprang the clasp, releasing the beautiful
mounds and she returned her hands to massaging them, teasing her dark nipples
into painful erection. She pulled B’Eanna’s top up, exposing her skin to her
view for the first time and she gasped at the woman’s beauty. Without volition,
her lips moved to take in one of the buds and she licked and circled the taut
tip, smiling as she heard B’Elanna growling in ecstasy. She could feel
B’Elanna’s small strong hands on her back and neck, tracing her implants,
sending surge after surge of desire through her. She moved to the other nipple,
letting her hand continue the massage of the one she had left and continued her
efforts. She could feel the power she had over B’Elanna as she carried on with
this activity. It made her heady with excitement and she wanted nothing more
than to pleasure B’Elanna as wholly as she could. B’Elanna released her grip on
Seven for just long enough to rid herself completely of her top and bra. Her
pulse was pounding between her legs and she wanted to return as much pleasure as
she could to Seven but she could hardly think as she reacted to Seven’s
ministrations. She felt Seven leave her breasts and continue kissing her abdomen
and navel, obviously intent on kissing as much of her body as possible and her
one dim thought was to reciprocate the passion she was feeling.</P>
<P>Seven continued down and slipped her fingers under the waistband of
B’Elanna’s trousers. She popped the button and B’Elanna raised her hips slightly
as she tugged the trousers and panties off together, sliding them down her legs
where she pulled of her boots as well. The whole lot came off as one package and
was tossed aside as Seven adorned B’Elanna’s legs with kisses, working her way
up slowly, alternating legs continuously. Unbidden, B’Elanna’s legs parted and
Seven could smell her arousal, a sweet musky aroma and she looked up to see
B’Elanna’s lips and thighs glistening with moisture. She continued her kissing
and as she got closer, began to taste B’Elanna’s readiness on both inner thighs.
She carefully licked each thigh clean before finally running her lips across
B’Elanna’s mound. B’Elanna groaned and bucked at the touch and Seven grinned
happily. She could feel her own arousal as her nipples tried to burst their way
through her bio-suit and her crotch was dark as her wetness spread. She wiped
her tongue across the outside of B’Elanna’s sex again and then allowed it to
probe deeper. She lapped the fluid seeping from her lover and searched the folds
with her tongue, seeking out the swollen nerve bud. She took B’Elanna’s engorged
clit into her teeth and rolled the tip of her tongue on it. B’Elanna screamed
and placed her hands firmly away from Seven, not wanting to inflict any damage
from the fingers she knew she’d use to claw with.</P>
<P>Seven adjusted her position slightly and placed one finger into B’Elanna’s
opening whilst still massaging her bud. She felt the vaginal muscles clamp down
on her but pushed another finger through and began rubbing gently into her,
building up rhythm slowly. B’Elanna was mewling at this and rocking her body in
time to the pressure. Seven took her fingers out completely to B’Elanna’s shock
but replaced them with two and then three fingers of her borg enhanced hand.
B’Elanna’s body bucked again, acting totally of its own will and Seven continued
the massage until, a short while later, B’Elanna erupted with a roar. Seven
hungrily lapped up the fluid gushing from B’Elanna and continued with the
onslaught, bringing her lover to orgasm again quickly and then extracted a third
orgasm out of her before B’Elanna laid a hand on her, indicating that she could
take no more.</P>
<P>Bringing her down gently, Seven finally moved away from B’Elanna’s mound and
moved her body up to lay face to face.</P>
<P>"Oh Kahless, that was incredible", gasped B’Elanna, smiling into Seven’s
eyes. Seven drew little circles on the darker woman’s skin, now slick with
sweat. "Kahless had nothing to do with it" she grinned.</P>
<P>B’Elanna face changed subtly and she drew her hands up to examine Seven’s
face. "So beautiful, my love", she whispered, almost to herself but with
complete sincerity, bringing a prick of tears to Seven’s eyes and a blush to her
cheeks. B’Elanna sat up slightly. "You don’t believe me?" she asked
incredulously. "No it’s not that, B’Elanna. No-one’s ever said that to me
before."</P>
<P>"Well they’ve missed their chance now", decided B’Elanna. She settled on the
floor again, barely noticing its cold hardness as she began tracing patterns on
Seven’s body through her bio suit. She could see Seven’s aching desire from her
erect nipples and her klingon sense of smell had picked up her arousal easily.
Seven stayed where she was, frightened to break even this gentle contact when
B’Elanna moved toward her slightly and kissed her lips gently. "I think we have
some unfinished business, my love," she murmured into her lips. Seven pulled
B’Elanna on top of her and relished her weight on her. B’Elanna raised herself
slightly and ran her fingers round the neck of Seven’s bio-suit. "Get this off",
she growled as she grabbed a handful of Seven’s hair and crushed her lips with a
barely contained desire.</P>
<P>Seven returned the kiss with fervour whilst reaching back and unfastening the
clasp from the back of her neck.</P>
<P>Seeing an opening at last, B’Elanna growled more deeply and ripped the body
suit open, revealing the younger woman’s upper torso and freeing her ample
mounds. B’Elanna fell hungrily on Seven’s left breast whilst using a hand to
massage her right one ferociously. She sucked and nipped at Seven’s alabaster
skin, reddening it with her attention. Seven gasped at the sensation and
allowing herself to get completely drawn into B’Elanna’s love making.</P>
<P>B’Elanna busied herself on both breasts, in no hurry to go anywhere else
until she could see Seven’s skin tingling with excitement. She traced the
lateral borg implant lazily with her fingertips and then her tongue, glorying in
Seven’s reaction to her. This woman was the most perfect vision she had ever
seen and she wanted her totally.</P>
<P>She jammed her knee into Seven’s groin feeling her wetness through the bio
suit. Continuing to explore Seven’s body, she ground her knee into Seven’s
pubis; delighting in feeling Seven squirm with tension, wanting release. Gently
rubbing her knee up and down, B’Elanna returned to seven’s breasts, determined
to prolong the experience for as long as she could endure.</P>
<P>Sensing that Seven was close to the edge, she withdrew her knee, hearing a
disappointed moan escape from Seven’s lips. "Patience, my love" she whispered
reassuringly as she slowly moved down. Seven’s body suit was peeled away totally
and thrown next to B’Elanna’s discarded clothing. Emulating Seven’s earlier
actions, B’Elanna slowly worked her way up, kissing and touching each firm,
toned leg, running fingertips all over her legs. Seven moaned again and opened
her legs wide, feeling an overwhelming longing for B’Elanna to enter her.
B’Elanna could see and smell her and wanted nothing more than to bury her face
into Seven’s mound, but she controlled herself and continued the slow path up.
She passed her fingers over Seven’s mound, running her fingers through the damp
curly hair and then over her folds, before going further and caressing Seven’s
crease before gently running a fingertip round her puckered anus, slick with
moisture that had run from Seven’s vagina. Torres continued to move her fingers
around the area until they were saturated with Seven’s fluid. Gently, she teased
the opening of her anus open again, easing a finger in gently. As she entered
her from behind, B’Elanna slipped two and then three fingers into her vagina,
causing Seven to almost overload with the sensation. Her body didn’t know where
to buck first, and she could feel the pressure within her build and build as
B’Elanna continued her ministrations, gently pumping both openings and getting
deeper and deeper. Just when she thought her senses could not be further
assaulted, B’Elanna bent down and ran her tongue over Seven’s clitoris,
massaging it mercilessly. Seven could no longer keep coherent thought as her
body reacted in a very physical way to B’Elanna’s touch. Suddenly, she blew,
screaming B’Elanna’s name and brought her knee up in a convulsive reflex action,
catching the klingon hybrid in the side of her head and throwing her some
distance from her.</P>
<P>She lay panting, relishing her body’s sensations as she still tingled,
committing every second of it to her eidetic memory even as she struggled to
come to her senses. A small groan from B’Elanna made her sit up suddenly and she
saw the smaller woman wipe blood away from her mouth.</P>
<P>"Oh my God, B’Elanna. What have I done?" she asked, full of remorse after
remembering how she had lashed out after coming to orgasm.</P>
<P>B’Elanna grinned, allowing more blood to trickle from her split lip.</P>
<P>"That’s the second time you’ve drawn my blood, Seven" she stated happily.
"You’ll have to marry me now".</P>
<P>Seven smiled back beatifically.</P>
