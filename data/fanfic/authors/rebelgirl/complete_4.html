<!-- Complete \ Part 4 -->

<P>Sickbay was bustling with activity and the tension was palpable. All the  occupants were aware that this was a dangerous procedure, despite the work that  had transpired to make it as safe as possible. However, there was always the  risk of unknown variables giving rise to complications.</P>
<P>Tom was there, making final preparations for the monitoring the Doctor wanted  done while he was off-line. He fussed over Seven as she tried to settle on a  bio-bed, masking his concern for her with an over-compensation of affection.  Seven, unsure of how to react to his overtures, became nervous and agitated,  unwilling to even lie on the bio-bed and allow the EMH to sedate her.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stepped in and placed a reassuring hand on her upper arm and applied  pressure gently. "Trust me," she asked of her simply, looking deeply into  Seven’s azure eyes. The younger woman returned the gaze steadily for a moment  before lying down dutifully. B’Elanna made herself comfortable at a workstation  near the bio-bed and checked her control console carefully, unaware of the looks  she received from both Tom and the Captain, who felt that it would be expedient  if she were present during the procedure. The young Chief Engineer sensed the  raw reaction to the nerves she felt churn in her stomach and wanted nothing more  than to tell everyone to disappear. Desperately clinging onto one of Tuvok’s  meditation techniques, she managed to focus purely on the task, succeeding in  stilling her shaking hands as she made her final preparations.</P>
<P>The Doctor, sensing the tension in the room, approached Seven carefully and  explained all his actions softly before sedating her. He placed all the neural  and critical monitoring electrodes carefully and then watched as the blonde  ex-drone’s eyelids flittered momentarily, battling against the anaesthetic,  before she finally succumbed to oblivious unconsciousness. He ran a few  diagnostics over her still form then, satisfied that Seven was in a deep enough  state, turned his attention to the Chief Engineer.</p>
<P>"B’Elanna", he began in the same style he had used with Seven, "I need you to  be monitored too. I’ve instructed Tom on all the danger signs and he will break  the connection between you and the circuitry if you’re put in danger." B’Elanna  nodded mutely as he placed electrodes on her, concentrating on every movement  the Doctor made. He then placed the neural link on her left temple and made a  few minor adjustments to the tiny controls on its side. The shell-like silver  pad lit up briefly with a multiple flash of red and green before one tiny  indicator began to blink regularly, indicating its readiness.</P>
<P>The EMH moved to another console and keyed in a series of commands. He looked  up when he finished, satisfied that everything had been prepared. "My matrix is  ready, B’Elanna. I’ve got the neural link ready for you. The instant you see me  go off-line, the neural link will activate. After that, it’s down to you", he  told her carefully.</p>
<P>As he spoke, Tom took his position at the monitoring station. He smiled at  his ex-girlfriend to reassure her before gazing at the prone form of Seven lying  on the bio-bed, her chest rising evenly, under the influence of the  sedative.</P>
<P>B’Elanna exhaled a deep breath through puffed out cheeks before indicating  that she was ready. "OK Doc. Let’s begin", she stated.</P>
<P>The EMH reacted by beginning his part of the procedure. Carefully, he  performed the biological part of the operation, delicately removing the tissues  surrounding the cortical inhibitor. Sickbay was eerily silent except for the  regular signals beeping from the monitoring circuitry, their monotones  indicating to the other occupants of the room that things were progressing  correctly. B’Elanna scrutinised the procedure at her workstation as it displayed  the Doctor’s work. It took the Doctor some time getting the area surrounding  Seven’s inhibitor ready to introduce the bio-neural circuitry but eventually he  straightened and stretched his back, despite not having a physical musculature  to ache.</P>
<P>He looked at B’Elanna almost wearily and the tension mounted. "I’ve primed  the linkages on the circuitry. Now it’s your turn." He smiled affectionately at  one of the few people he counted as a true friend. "Good luck B’Elanna", he  offered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna returned his smile. "I’ll see you in a bit, Doc", she said softly.  The EMH nodded and then shimmered out of existence.</P>
<P>Almost before the Doctor’s image dissipated, B’Elanna felt a buzzing surge  through her head, as if her brain was suffering with pins and needles. The Chief  Engineer was taken aback as the sensation had not occurred during any of the  simulations but as her brain adjusted to the extra input, she recognised the  control she now had over all the circuitry.</P>
<P>Her vision had been slightly affected too, tainting her sight with a red and  yellow haze, softening the edges of the images she saw, yet perversely  sharpening the content they enveloped at the same time. She adjusted quickly to  the concept, scanning her workstation that was displaying the inhibitor for her  to work on.</P>
<P>Immediately, she put into practice the rehearsed sequence of attachment and  was gratified to see how instantaneously everything reacted to her thought. On  another level, she realised that she was sweating profusely and that her heart  rate had increased as her parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems  reacted to the new stimuli.</P>
<P>Tom monitored both women carefully, noting how Seven’s vital signs were  remaining encouragingly stable. B’Elanna’s monitoring was far more eclectic and  Tom hovered nervously near the safety cut-off in case the half-klingon started  exhibiting signs of life-threatening stress.</P>
<P>Janeway, with nothing to do except be a witness to the process, stayed close  to Seven’s bed, her right hand placed gently on the beautiful borg’s shoulder,  reasoning that she could perhaps project reassurance to her through the touch.  Despite his work, Tom noticed the action and narrowed his eyes slightly but said  nothing. He took a medical tricorder and scanned both B’Elanna and Seven, duly  recording the results in the medical log.</p>
<P>B’Elanna now had no concept of the outside world. Her entire brain was  focused on the bio-neural circuitry and the inhibitor as she worked rapidly. She  knew that any time now, the nanoprobes would recognise her intrusion and react  in a similar way to white blood cells detecting a foreign body in the  bloodstream. She was totally oblivious to the sweat secreted from her every  pore, moisture running over her brow ridges and down her face to fall in heavy  droplets onto her tunic and the console as well as soak her back as she  concentrated on the task at hand.</p>
<P>Suddenly she was aware of the first onslaught of nanoprobes, reacting as  predicted by attacking the physical circuitry. She had studied this in great  detail and controlled the bio-neural circuitry quickly and effectively,  surrounding and cutting off each nanoprobe attack as she integrated more  circuits. This cat-and-mouse continued and the attacks became more consolidated.  She recognised vaguely that she had only been working for a short while yet her  body felt totally exhausted through the sheer mental exertion. She was starting  to really feel under pressure now but forced herself to stay calm and combat the  nanoprobes methodically. She knew she was getting close when the nanoprobes  started swamping the area and so she decided to concentrate on the integration,  believing that once the circuitry was in place, the nanoprobes would cease their  rejection.</P>
<P>She progressed to the final part of the procedure – the cortical inhibitor  removal. Each cortical link had to be severed and then replaced with the  components from the bio-neural installation. Steeling herself, she started on  the last phase. Her exhaustion was beginning to get oppressive but she refused  to succumb to it. She had to backtrack many times, repairing work undone by the  nanoprobes but every successfully completed integration was left alone,  unrecognised by the nanoprobes as alien technology.</p>
<P>Eventually, the drained engineer ran a number of diagnostics to confirm that  she really had isolated the inhibitor. She could now safely remove the borg  technology without affecting Seven’s other systems.</P>
<P>Satisfied that she had accomplished her task, she allowed herself a moment of  triumph as she physically removed the inhibitor, but it was short-lived as her  mind recognised that the nanoprobes had switched attack and had flooded the  holographic matrix in an effort to combat the source of Seven’s "infection". Now  she had a real battle on her hands.</P>
<P>Her mind worked furiously, mentally fighting her way out of the corner she  had been backed into. Her primeval klingon survival instincts were dredged up to  work alongside her engineering brilliance as she slowly overcame onslaught after  onslaught. She refused to recognise how fatigued her mind and body were as she  slowly purged the holographic matrix of the nanoprobes, hoping that the Doctor  would be able to assist her as soon as the matrix was available for him to  use.</P>
<P>The moment the inhibitor was removed, Tom sprang into action, running  multiple diagnostics on Seven to see how her other systems were reacting to its  absence. After an initial anomaly in her readings, he realised that all systems  were functioning within desired parameters. Her body had even stopped generating  nanoprobes. Tom found that to be the most reassuring sign; her body had accepted  and adapted to the bio-neural circuitry. He didn’t consider that the nanoprobes  were still waging a war elsewhere. Gently he pressed a hypospray into Seven’s  slender neck, the implement hissing slightly as it yielded its contents into  her.</P>
<P>Seven sensed her surroundings before her body could physically react. It  seemed to take a great effort to get her eyelids open and her mouth would not  project the words she wanted to say. Her auditory nerves registered the  unintelligible mumblings she heard as her own voice as she tried to speak and  reassure everyone that she was still alive. She focused on that thought for a  long moment. She had accomplished the first part of the project. As soon as she  could get her body to react physically to her instructions, she would be able to  analyse whether the procedure had been a success.</P>
<P>Captain Janeway squeezed her young protégé’s shoulder and spoke quietly to  her. "You’re going to be fine, Seven", she told her softly. "Don’t fight the  sedation, just let it wear off", she coaxed, hoping that the slowly recovering  ex-drone could hear her.</p>
<P>Slowly, Seven’s cerulean blue eyes were revealed as her lids finally opened.  She saw the faces of Captain Janeway and Tom Paris gaze at her, both smiling  sweetly. Now that she was fully conscious she tried to sit up but was prevented  by hands gently pushing her back.</P>
<P>"Stay still a while yet, please honey," Tom said softly. "We need to run a  few more diagnostics to make sure everything is fine, and you need to rest.  You’ve been through a traumatic operation." He stroked her other shoulder,  unwilling to leave her side.</P>
<P>"How do you feel?" Janeway asked, wondering what the removal of the inhibitor  would reveal.</P>
<P>Seven lay still and considered her answer, her eyes flicking nervously around  the room as she tried to analyse her feelings.</P>
<P>"I do not know Captain. At this time, other than feeling the after-effects of  the process, I do not feel any different", she replied eventually, unable to  keep the disappointment from her voice.</P>
<P>"It will probably take a while to adjust. It may also take a trigger for you  to realise that your emotions are no longer inhibited", Janeway reasoned. "We’ll  get the Doctor back on line to examine you and take it from there."</P>
<P>Seven nodded at the Captain’s logic. Her throat felt tight and her eyes stung  as her disappointment continued to wash over her. She rolled her eyes to prevent  the tears shedding before swallowing and asking her audience, "Shouldn’t the  Doctor be back on-line by now?"</P>
<P>Tom frowned at the question and then approached the nearest console. He  looked up, confusion splayed across his face. "Captain, I can’t get the EMH  running. The computer keeps denying him access to the matrix", he explained.</P>
<P>The Captain rushed to his side and ran another series of diagnostics. With  mounting concern, their hands flew over the workstations, trying to track down  the source of the problem.</P>
<P>"The matrix won’t operate because it still has nanoprobes in it," exclaimed  Janeway suddenly, as the results of her work were displayed. Her frown furrowed  deeply as she tried to purge the buffer repeatedly.</P>
<P>"Disengage the neural link", ordered Janeway quickly as she spun around and  saw her Chief Engineer for the first time since she had started the procedure.  B’Elanna’s complexion had turned to a deathly white, her sweat- soaked hair  plastered to her head. Janeway stared in horror as she watched B’Elanna’s whole  body trembling, her mouth open in a silent scream, and could only wonder at what  sort of torment the half-klingon must be suffering.</P>
<P>As Tom sprang into action, B’Elanna arched her back, her face a rictus of  agony for an instant, before she slumped to the floor in a lifeless heap.</P>
<P>A heart-rending scream emanated from the bio-bed as Seven launched herself  from it. "B’Elanna!"</P>
