<P>When the all- consuming blackness altered, she heard voices. They were  muffled though, with only the deeper vocal resonances audible, as if they were  being listened to underwater. Whoever they were, there was a frantic sense of  urgency to them. Unable to identify the voices, she tried to open her eyes and  see her companions but the blackness stayed. The feeling was bizarre; she felt  her eyes were open, yet could only see an unending blackness. She realised that  the tenuous perception she had on reality was slipping, the slightest stimuli  fading away as oblivion washed over her.</P>
<P>When she heard the voices a second time, despite still only being able to  hear the lower register, she detected a less panicked tone. There was less  shouting and she realised that she could now differentiate the voices into  separate distinct people. There were two deeper masculine voices and one  slightly more feminine one. Once again, her eyes would not comply and open for  her and she felt a wave of frustration flood through her as the isolation  continued. All too soon, the inky black well of darkness robbed her of a chance  to attract the voices’ attention.</P>
<P>The voices came again. This time there was clarity to them and she could  identify their owners. With a concerted effort, she forced her eyes open. They  battled against her but somehow she prised them open, feeling her pupils  contract quickly to regulate the amount of light shining onto her retinas. She  wondered if she would have the same trouble getting her voice to work as her  vision sharpened and focused on the concerned faces of the Captain, Doctor and  Tom Paris staring down at her. Her peripheral vision gave her enough information  to recognise where she was and she assumed by her position that she was lying on  a bio-bed in Sickbay.</P>
<P>Belatedly, she realised that they were speaking to her. Rolling her tongue  around inside her mouth and swallowing repeatedly in order to lubricate her  throat, she tried to answer but was alarmed at how weak her voice sounded, as  all she managed was a parched croak.</P>
<P>"Just lie still and rest. You’ve been through one hell of an ordeal", the  Captain spoke softly, laying a hand on her shoulder and squeezing it  reassuringly.</P>
<P>She did not want to lie still though. There was a burning desire for  information that she wanted to quench. She coughed, hoping that the action would  strengthen her pathetic voice. "Captain, how’s B’Elanna?"</P>
<P>The three faces looking down at her locked eyes instantaneously. The action  alarmed Seven and she raised herself onto her elbows, as much as the restraining  hands would allow, ignoring the protests from her colleagues as she scanned the  room for the young Klingon.</P>
<P>On an adjacent bio-bed, Seven saw the hybrid engineer, seemingly asleep on  her back, arms lying down her sides. The advanced medical monitoring equipment  arched over her torso, the panel at one side sporadically lighting up as new  input was received.</p>
<P>The statuesque blonde attempted to sit up further and swing her legs round to  get off her bed but the Doctor interjected before she completed the manoeuvre.  "Please Seven, stay where you are for the moment. Do you have any memory of what  happened at all?" he asked as he moved the tiny cylindrical portion of the  medical tricorder around her head to take readings.</P>
<P>At first, Seven felt a mystified confusion at the Doctor’s words but his  question acted as a catalyst and her confusion dissipated. The floodgate to her  memories opened. With a burning intensity, her last conscious moments deluged  her….</p>
<P>She remembered lunging forward, B’Elanna’s name being ripped from her throat  as an anguish she had never experienced before tore through her, almost  paralysing her with fear.</P>
<P>She was at the engineer’s side instantly; frenziedly feeling for a pulse at  the half klingon’s neck as her eyes scanned the woman thoroughly, looking for  any indication that B’Elanna was still alive. Torment turned to relief as she  saw B’Elanna’s chest rise but the movement was abnormal, her respirations rapid  and irregular. Her pulse too was barely palpable and Seven’s relief vanished as  quickly as it had appeared. The rapid swing of emotions was taking its toll on  the recovering drone and a small part of her distantly realised that she was  starting to panic. This revelation ironically served to agitate her alarm and  Seven spiralled rapidly down the path to hysteria.</P>
<P>Feeling helpless, she swung round and lashed out at Tom. "Do something!" She  demanded, grabbing the collar of his jacket and propelling him closer to the  unconscious woman with a vicious twist of the material.</P>
<P>Tom, who had run a series of diagnostics on B’Elanna from behind Seven,  adjusted his neck, moving the material of his tunic sufficiently to restore  circulation and become more comfortable in the hold of the panicked ex-borg. "I  don’t understand this, Seven. All her readings are displaying normal parameters.  According to my tricorder, there’s nothing wrong with her".</P>
<P>Seven tightened her grip furiously. "Does she look <I>normal, </I>Lieutenant  Paris?" she hissed, venom lacing her words.</P>
<P>Tom had to admit the blonde woman had a point but he was baffled. He called  back to Janeway desperately, unable to turn to her due to the vice- like grip  the ex-drone had on his tunic. "Any success getting the Doc back on-line?"</P>
<P>The Captain barely registered the exchange between the helmsman and  Astrometrics officer as she battled to eradicate the nanoprobes from the  holo-matrix buffer, her face set determinedly. She’d beaten the Borg Queen; a  few of their nanoprobes weren’t going to defeat her. Her hands attacked the  console, running a complicated sequence of procedures that Janeway hoped would  purge the buffer.</P>
<P>With a snarl of satisfaction, she turned to watch as the Doctor materialised  next to her.</P>
<P>"Please state the.." the EMH began automatically.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna’s hurt", interjected Seven desperately, her voice tight with  concern.</P>
<P>The Doctor took in the scene instantly and grabbed the tricorder from Paris’  left hand.</P>
<P>"I suggest you let go of Mr Paris before we have another casualty", he  replied laconically.</P>
<P>He frowned into the tricorder before making adjustments on the instrument  "These readings don’t make sense", he mused, almost to himself.</P>
<P>"That’s what I said", agreed Tom, shooting Seven a look of aggrieved  justification.</P>
<P>"Will you stop prevaricating and help her", insisted Seven, her voice rising  as her hysteria continued to mount.</P>
<P>"Calm down, Seven", the Doctor advised as he bent forward and took the  unconscious engineer into his arms.</P>
<P>He stood up effortlessly and placed the dark woman onto a nearby bio-bed.  Seven relinquished her hold on Tom to follow the Doctor and, no longer having a  death grip to pull against, the pilot fell back with an undignified grunt before  picking himself up and joining the others at B’Elanna’s side.</P>
<P>The Doctor looked at all the monitoring data accumulated during the procedure  and made a series of adjustments on the panel. "You need to treat the patient  not the instruments, Mr Paris. One of the first rules of medicine", he reminded  his assistant.</P>
<P>Paris looked suitably chagrined and observed the EMH closely, hoping to  redeem himself in some way.</P>
<P>Suddenly the prone engineer’s body began to spasm, her back flexing and  extending as her limbs thrashed convulsively. Seven’s hysteria returned as the  Doctor and Paris flew into action.</P>
<P>"20mg cintromazapine", barked the EMH as he rapidly digested the data. "Damn,  her acetycholine levels are off the scale", he murmured.</p>
<P>"What’s happening?" demanded the young Borg. Janeway put her arm round the  willowy blonde in an effort to comfort her, but Seven shrugged it off angrily,  not wanting succour. "Doctor?" she prompted, her eyes fixed on the convulsing  engineer.</P>
<P>The EMH ignored her and continued to process the information from the console  as Tom administered the hypospray.</P>
<P>"No effect", stated Paris, as he grabbed further hyposprays.</P>
<P>"I can see that", replied the Doctor curtly. "Increase dose to 40mg".</P>
<P>Suddenly, an alarm wailed on the monitoring panel as B’Elanna’s body stopped  moving.</P>
<P>"She’s arrested!" exclaimed Janeway from her place next to Seven.</P>
<P>"Everyone’s a doctor", remarked the EMH sarcastically as he began the  resuscitation protocol.</P>
<P>It was too much for Seven. She had approached B’Elanna to help her overcome  the cortical inhibitor problem and now B’Elanna was dying, if not dead, she  thought histrionically. Her emotions now free to run rampant, Seven had no  experience in controlling them. The escalating hysteria running through her was  overwhelming. …..</P>
<P>From her semi-recumbent position on the bio-bed, Seven stared accusingly at  the Captain. "You sedated me", she asserted angrily.</P>
<P>"I had to, Seven", the Captain replied in a soft tone. "Your", she hesitated  slightly, "concern for B’Elanna interfered with the Doctor’s work", she  explained, fervently hoping that Seven would not over-react again.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, Seven looked thoughtful for a moment. "Then why was it so  difficult for me to regain consciousness?" she asked, recalling her recent  battle.</P>
<P>The Captain looked uncomfortable and adjusted her position slightly,  unwilling to answer.</p>
<P>"She over-cooked the quantity. You had enough tranquilliser to knock out an  elephant", the Doctor interjected on Janeway’s behalf.</P>
<P>It took a moment for Seven to recall what an elephant was but decided not to  pursue the issue.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" she prompted again.</P>
<P>"She’s alive", reassured the Doctor. "But we’re unsure how badly affected her  mind is. I’ve kept her sedated to give her an opportunity to recover from the  stress she’s been through. I’ll wake her in the morning."</P>
<P>"What happened to her?" Seven asked, hungry for more information.</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes launched an attack on B’Elanna through the holo-matrix  buffer. They tried to overload her synapses and break down her own neural  control. Fortunately she managed to put up a defensive barrier. However the  sustained onslaught caused some areas of her brain to suffer chemical  breakdown."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened in alarm so the Doctor continued hurriedly. "My medical  expertise allowed me to repair a lot of the damage, but until she is awake, I  can’t know for sure if there are any permanent after-effects from her prolonged  contact with the bio-neural link." He sighed apologetically, wanting to be able  to give total reassurance but morally unable to do so. "Try not to worry too  much. We’ll just have to take each stage as it comes".</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes briefly, allowing her emotions to course through her.  The conflict of relief that B’Elanna was still alive and anguish that she was  still in danger was confusing to deal with. She felt a hand take hers and she  looked at Tom.</P>
<P>"The good news is that you’re fine Seven. The bio-neural circuitry has been  integrated perfectly. Looks like you’ve got your emotions." He told her quietly,  surprised to see a single tear roll down her alabaster cheek. He wiped it away  with his thumb as the Doctor ran his tricorder over her. "I cannot seek comfort  in that until I know B’Elanna is functioning normally", she replied  miserably.</P>
<P>"I can release you from sickbay, Seven. However I think it would be wise not  to be on your own for the next twenty four hours", the Doctor told her.</p>
<P>Janeway opened her mouth to speak but was prohibited by Tom as he smiled at  Seven. "Don’t worry Doc, I’ll look after her." Accepting that Tom was the more  logical choice to be with Seven, the Captain shut her mouth and decided to say  nothing. Her time would come, she decided darkly.</p>
<P>"Will you let me know if there’s any change in B’Elanna’s condition?" Seven  asked as stood up from the bio-bed. The Doctor nodded his agreement and the tall  Astrometrics officer allowed Tom to lead her out of Sickbay. She stole a final  glance at the unconscious form of B’Elanna Torres before the doors hissed shut,  feeling her heart somersault with worry for the half klingon.</P>
<P>She turned to Tom who was waiting patiently next to her. "I want to see the  children," she told him flatly.</P>
<P>"Um, I’m not sure that’s such a good idea, Seven", Tom hedged, concerned that  Seven might not be able to cope with another emotionally charged encounter.</P>
<P>Seven looked at him and raised her enhanced eyebrow in defiance. "I am going  to see the children Tom. It will make no difference to me whether you accompany  me or not."</P>
<P>Tom flinched inwardly, uncomfortable that the ex-drone did not care about his  attendance. He nodded his agreement, and the two officers made their way to  Cargo Bay Two.</P>
<P>Once there, Seven hurried over to the children with a mixture of dread and  excitement, wondering how she would react to her "family". As she pulled Mizoti  into a warm embrace, she smiled widely, her worry evaporating as the joy of  their closeness enveloped her. They asked her questions about the procedure,  probing deeply into the technical aspects as well as how the results might  propagate. Seven found she was not embarrassed by their questioning and was  happy to share the experience with them.</P>
<P>"Does this mean that we have to go through the same procedure?" asked Rebi,  nervously tugging at his shirt hem.</P>
<P>Seven shook her head as she answered, resting her hand on his arm to still  his fidgeting. "No. None of you have an inhibitor. It may be that they are only  given to particular drones or that they get introduced at a later stage of  development. I do not know why, but only I was affected by this." She saw  unmasked relief flit across the children’s faces as she told them. She too was  gladdened by this quirk, as she couldn’t ask B’Elanna to go through the  procedure again and doubted that the Captain would give permission.</P>
<P>With their desire for information sated, Seven ensured that the children were  properly entertained for the evening, asking Neelix to visit and relate another  ghost story for them. She organised their nutritional requirements for the  evening and generally fussed around them until Icheb approached her.</P>
<P>"Go and rest Seven. We’re fine now we know that you’re functioning normally.  You must need to regenerate by now", he reasoned.</p>
<P>Tom pursued the matter further. "Come on Seven, Neelix will call if there’s a  problem. You’ve trusted him before. Come back to my quarters. I’ll stay nearby  while you sleep just in case there are any problems." He tugged at her sleeve as  she continued to hesitate. Icheb nodded at her encouragingly as the other  children busied themselves with games of kadis-kot.</P>
<P>Seven sighed. "Tom, I would prefer to regenerate. It would be more beneficial  for me than normal sleep", she explained.</P>
<P>"Would you at least have dinner with me then?" he asked hopefully.</P>
<P>Seven nodded her acquiescence, realising that she needed to talk to Tom  privately. At least she could take the opportunity to do that in the seclusion  of his quarters.</P>
<P>They shared an uncomplicated meal that Seven ate mechanically, wondering over  her feelings for both Tom and B’Elanna. The young ex-drone now realised that she  didn’t love Tom and was equally certain that she could not grow to love him  while the fiery Chief Engineer consumed all her thoughts. The more she analysed  her feelings, the more convinced she became that she was in love with B’Elanna.  These last few weeks had served to bring out her emotions. Her anxiety for  B’Elanna whilst she remained in sickbay highlighted those emotions. Seven almost  laughed at the irony. Her newly unleashed emotions had almost cost her the one  person she wanted to share them with. What she found most difficult to do was  articulate her feelings to Tom however, without hurting him.</P>
<P>Tom, uncomfortable in the silence, stole frequent glances at Seven, trying to  read her usually impassive face. He was surprised to see a whole gamut of  emotions splayed across her visage as she contemplated something of great  significance.</P>
<P>He jumped as she sighed suddenly and peered at her closely. "Are you all  right Seven?" he asked, worried that the procedure was taking its toll on the  young Borg.</p>
<P>"Tom, I have to say something to you," Seven began and then hesitated as the  words she wanted to speak failed to form into intelligible sentences.</P>
<P>Tom sat back, knowing what was about to happen. He had gone through too many  break-ups not to recognise the signs. They never got any easier though, he  decided as his stomach lurched at the expectation of the following words.</P>
<P>"Tom, I cannot continue this relationship. I do not love you…"</P>
<P>"But you’ve just had the inhibitor removed. At least give yourself a chance  with me to see what happens", Tom interrupted quickly.</P>
<P>"My relationship with you, or lack of it, has nothing to do with the  inhibitor", Seven continued carefully.</p>
<P>Tom looked at her shrewdly. "Are you in love with someone else then?" he  probed.</P>
<P>Seven fidgeted, uncomfortable at the sudden scrutiny and surprised by the  helmsman’s insight. "I do not know," she replied hesitantly but continued on  before Paris could interject again. "I need to investigate my feelings further  on this. It would be unfair of me to do this whilst still involved with you".  She hoped that her words had not been too harsh but realised that there would be  no easy way of telling him.</P>
<P>Paris slumped in his chair dejectedly and sighed dramatically. "Well I’ve  been dumped in worse ways", he told her with a watery smile.</P>
<P>Seven returned the smile just as weakly, recognising that he had accepted his  fate graciously.</P>
<P>"I think it would be prudent if I returned to my alcove to regenerate Tom",  She told him, not wishing to prolong his agony. She stood up but swayed as her  legs straightened. Instantly, Tom was on his feet and by her side.</P>
<P>"Hey, what’s up?" he asked, steadying her with strong hands on her  shoulders.</P>
<P>"I am fatigued. I must regenerate", she explained, her face a pasty white as  the colour drained from it, as if to highlight her condition.</P>
<P>"Look, I can escort you back, but you can just as easily crash in my bed",  Tom offered. "I’ll sleep on the couch out here. That way, I’m close by if you  need anything", he reasoned. Seven was surprised by his generosity after her  rejection. She felt her body sway again as exhaustion took hold of her. Not  wanting the long trip back to Cargo Bay Two, Seven nodded and stumbled into  Tom’s room, falling heavily onto the bed and barely registering Tom covering her  as sleep overcame her. A tiny smile tugged at her lips as her last waking  thought was how easy she found it to fall asleep.</P>
<P>Tom looked at the slumbering woman for a moment before leaving the room,  extinguishing the lighting as he exited. He grabbed a spare blanket from a  storage compartment and threw it at the couch in preparation for later. He sat  down and stretched his legs out onto the nearby coffee table. He was too  emotionally wrung out to sleep yet. Tom took his time winding down, allowing his  mind to digest all the interaction that had taken place, wondering who it was  that had stolen Seven from him.</P>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<P>The Doctor re-checked the instrumentation panel before preparing the  hypospray that would revive Lieutenant Torres. He might only be a hologram but  he realised that he was nervous about waking the half-klingon, concerned over  what he might find once he could examine her fully.</P>
<P>Steeling himself to expect the worst, yet fervently hoping that she was  recovered, he pressed the cylindrical instrument to her neck.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes snapped open and a hand batted away the hypospray as she  bolted upright, a look of bewildered alarm on her face.</P>
<P>"At ease, Lieutenant." The gravelly voice of the Captain broke through the  defensive barrier B’Elanna had automatically erected and she scanned the room to  see both Janeway and the EMH standing next to her bed. She pulled her knees up  and hugged them, trying to relax her tense body and she looked at the Doctor,  her face clouded with confusion.</P>
<P>"What happened?" she asked simply, absently wondering when she had consumed  all the blood wine that must surely be responsible for the pounding headache she  was now suffering.</P>
<P>"The procedure was a success for Seven, but at your expense", the EMH replied  cryptically, prompting B’Elanna to narrow her eyes at him, tacitly asking him to  explain further.</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes mounted an attack on you, trying to force your brain into  chemical breakdown. Fortunately, you fended off the attack, but the prolonged  exposure with the bio-neural link took its toll on you and you nearly died.  Providentially, my medical proficiency kept you alive once again. However, up  until you regained consciousness, I wasn’t sure if there was any permanent  damage". The Doctor tried to keep the explanation as short and as simple as  possible, certain that the dark engineer would be unreceptive to a more  voluminous description of the events.</P>
<P>His explanation brought back the memories of the process. B’Elanna squeezed  her eyes shut briefly at the recollection of the pain and fear she had felt  whilst trying to save herself from the nanoprobes. Interlaced with the anxiety  induced by the link was a feeling of awe that she had effectively controlled the  bio-neural circuitry. It had been an incredible achievement to actually command  materials mentally. Her analytical mind wondered briefly if that control could  be utilised again if the situation so demanded it and the engineer vowed to look  into the topic.</P>
<P>One of the strangest sensations was that she felt like she had been a witness  to the events, watching from a corner of the room as her body at first stayed  stock-still, in a rigid pose of pain, before slumping to the floor, the physical  body giving way before the cerebral body was finished. She even had a vague  image of Seven and Tom standing over her before the memories receded to  nothingness. The exhaustion and pain her mind and body had experienced was  emulated again as she sat there but she doggedly shrugged the sensations off,  convinced that they were psychosomatic side effects of the torment she  suffered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna rested her head in her hands, massaging her temples gently. "So  Seven’s okay then?" she asked, disregarding the agony pounding behind her eyes  and ignoring the dialogue that centred on her own fate.</P>
<P>"She will be. The circuitry has been integrated perfectly. She just needs  some time to recover", the Captain answered. "Congratulations, B’Elanna. You did  a fine job. I’m just glad you’re here in one piece to realise it." B’Elanna  nodded at the Captain’s praise but felt disappointed that Seven wasn’t here too.  She was probably regenerating still, she reasoned logically but the thought  didn’t really appease the klingon.</P>
<P>The Doctor selected another hypospray and placed it at the dark woman’s neck.  Immediately, the intensity of her headache diminished and B’Elanna smiled at him  gratefully.</p>
<P>"So when can I get out of here?" she asked.</p>
<P>The Doctor grinned at her. "I still find it surprising how much you dislike  being in sickbay considering you’re in here more than any other member of this  crew."</P>
<P>"It must be the Chief Medical Officer’s winning personality", she retorted  glibly.</P>
<P>"I’ll bear that in mind for next time", the Doctor shot back as he ran his  tricorder over her head. " I’m relieved to say that your readings are normal.  I’ll release you from sickbay on the condition that you rest. I need to keep a  close eye on you though, so you must report back here in eight hours for a  check-up. You’ve been relieved from duty till I pass you fit so it’s probably  wise to take my advice." He continued as the shorter woman swung her legs over  the bio-bed to alight from it. "However, if you feel anything abnormal or have  any concerns whatsoever, come back immediately. Neurological problems can be  notoriously difficult to detect." As he spoke, he placed a small, silver,  shell-like object just behind her ear. "This is a cortical monitor. It will  reassure me that you really are all right and alert me if your brain activity  becomes aberrant and you’re unable to contact me yourself."</p>
<P>B’Elanna recognised the concern the EMH was displaying and appreciated his  attempt to minimise her stay in sickbay. However, she couldn’t shake a sensation  of general irritation at all the attention she was receiving. "Doc, I’d just  like to get out of here", B’Elanna reminded him, trying to cut short his  diatribe.</p>
<P>Janeway smiled at her and squeezed the younger woman’s arm, offering her  support, as always, with a tactile gesture. "Take all the time you need,  B’Elanna. It will only be on the Doctor’s behest that I allow you to come back  on duty".</p>
<P>The Klingon nodded mutely and pushed herself off the bio-bed. As the small,  dark-haired woman disappeared behind the closing sickbay doors, the Captain  turned to the EMH. "Will she make a full recovery then, Doctor?"</P>
<P>The Doctor paused momentarily. "It’s difficult to say, Captain. Physically,  the prognosis is good, as long as I can keep a close monitor on her condition in  case of any anomalies", he qualified carefully.</P>
<P>"I sense a <I>but</I> to this conversation", remarked Janeway dryly.</P>
<P>"There’s a massive ‘but’, Captain", the Doctor cautioned, his tone deadly  serious. "I have no idea how this is going to affect her psychologically. The  neurological stress she underwent has never been analysed before. More to the  point, my deficiencies as a psychologist are well documented." He displayed a  delicate moue of disgust at the memory of his abortive attempts to help Seven  cope with an alleged assault many months ago.</P>
<P>"Doctor, all I can ask is that you do your best." Janeway replied. "I’ll make  sure its duly noted amongst the senior staff so that they can report any worries  to you, if they so wish." Janeway stared at the sickbay doors, her eyes slightly  unfocused as she imagined her Chief Engineer returning to her quarters. "Let’s  just hope that we’re worrying over nothing".</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Loping easily through the corridor towards her quarters, B’Elanna mused on  what had happened. She wanted nothing more than to discuss the procedure with  Seven but was disinclined to disturb her from her regeneration cycle. Suddenly  the diminutive klingon skidded to a halt, a dread feeling surging through her.  What if Seven had decided to explore her new feelings with Paris? B’Elanna  closed her eyes in a futile attempt to block that image but her curiosity  remained unchecked and she found herself asking the computer for Seven’s  location.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is in Lieutenant Paris’ quarters", the computer stated  crisply. B’Elanna convulsively clenched her fists for an instant before resuming  her journey to her own quarters, wondering if it was now too late to ever tell  Seven of the feelings she had for her.</P>
<P>Once inside, B’Elanna decided to treat herself to a shower with real water,  splurging some of her stockpiled replicator rations. Setting the water  temperature as high as she could tolerate, the engineer stood underneath the  jets of water for some time, relishing the tingling as the water practically  scalded her caramel skin. Thoroughly soaked, she concentrated on washing her  hair first, working up a lather as she massaged her scalp before rinsing the  bubbles away, feeling them creep slowly down her back before waves of water  hurtled them down more rapidly. As her fingers brushed past the cortical  monitor, she belatedly questioned the device’s water resistance and contemplated  removing it until she finished. There was something reassuring about its  presence though, so she decided to leave it in place in the hope that Starfleet  had considered the possibility of the thing getting wet.</p>
<P>She selected some soapstone to attend her skin with, its abrasive quality  scraping away the top layer as she worked it over her body with her hands,  rubbing the soap in with small circular motions. She speculated whether her  actions could be analysed for some hidden psychological meaning of ritual  cleansing but pushed the thoughts away, not wanting an answer. As she finished  rinsing, she heard the chime of her door. She considered ignoring the entry  request but curiosity got the better of her. Grabbing the thick, black bathrobe  that hung on the bathroom door, she shrugged it on; wrapping the material around  her wet skin and hurriedly tying the belt tightly round her as she approached  the door, choosing to open it in person.</P>
<P>"Seven", she exclaimed, as the doors revealed the identity of her visitor.  "Come in", she stammered, standing to one side to allow the tall blonde woman  admission.</P>
<P>Seven looked at B’Elanna briefly before entering, feeling her heart hammer in  her chest as she took in the beauty of the woman, admiring the strong legs and  the brief glimpse of her chest as the engineer’s robe shifted slightly in her  move to allow Seven entrance to her quarters.</P>
<P>On her way to the Chief Engineer’s quarters, Seven had decided determinedly  to tell B’Elanna of her feelings. Now she stood in the middle of her living  area, watching as B’Elanna wedged herself into the corner of a sofa, hugging her  knees and her resolution seemed to disintegrate, leaving her with a dread  feeling of self-doubt and anxiety.</P>
<P>"You can sit if you want to", invited B’Elanna, breaking into the sudden  turmoil of thoughts that raced through the Seven’s mind. Automatically, she sat  down, her back rigidly straight as she looked at the dark engineer.</P>
<P>"I came to see that you were recovered from your ordeal", Seven began,  licking her lips nervously before continuing. "And to apologise for not  attending sickbay. I was still asleep".</P>
<P>B’Elanna flinched inwardly, knowing where Seven had been asleep, but she  recognised the ex-drone’s concern. "Seven, there’s no need to apologise. You’ve  been through a massive ordeal yourself." She ran a hand absently through her wet  hair, trying to keep the thick tresses under some sort of control as it dried  naturally and was surprised to see Seven lean forward and scrutinise her  closely.</p>
<P>"You’re wearing a cortical monitor", the borg stated, alarm coursing through  her body.</P>
<P>"It’s so the Doc could release me from sickbay. He knows how much I hate it  in there." B’Elanna tried to play down its significance but felt a small thrill  at Seven’s concern.</P>
<P>"I am sorry B’Elanna", the young blonde woman said again, her body slouching  back into the chair. "I should never have asked you to do this for me."</P>
<P>"Don’t start down the road of guilt", B’Elanna warned quickly. "I wanted to  do this. I wanted to do it for a friend." Seven’s head snapped up to look at  B’Elanna again. The klingon swallowed briefly before continuing. "You haven’t  told me yet if it was a success."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her in confusion. "The bio-neural circuitry has been  integrated effectively."</P>
<P>"That’s not what I meant". The dark engineer sighed, not wanting to hear the  next answer but paradoxically needing to know if her efforts had been worth the  trouble. "Have your emotions become un-restricted?"</P>
<P>Seven sat and stared at her companion for a long moment as she tried to  formulate her answer.</P>
<P>"I do not know", she eventually answered.</P>
<P>"Oh, come on Seven. You were in Tom’s quarters all night", blurted B’Elanna  unthinkingly.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes narrowed slightly and she felt a secret thrill that B’Elanna had  bothered to find out her whereabouts.</P>
<P>"I was in Tom’s quarters all night asleep", Seven amended quietly. "I was  exhausted after the procedure and fell asleep on his bed." She looked for any  reaction on the klingon’s face as she finished. "He slept on the couch outside",  and felt certain that she saw a glimmer of relief drift across the expressive  engineer’s visage.</P>
<P>B’Elanna hugged her knees in tight, her desires warring with her honour. It  wasn’t fair to tell Seven of her feelings when her own emotions had just been  unleashed, particularly when she was involved with someone else but she longed  to share those new emotions with her and experience them together.</P>
<P>Seven noticed the shift in mood and decided that now was the time to own up  to B’Elanna about her feelings. She couldn’t shake the dread feeling that she  might be rejected but she wanted to share her newly unleashed emotions with  B’Elanna. She wanted B’Elanna to be the one to free her innermost desires and to  experience complete depth of emotion with the passionate klingon.</P>
<P>"Seven, I have to tell you something", B’Elanna began determinedly but found  herself hesitating. She cursed herself inwardly for the frightened Tikka cat  that she was.</P>
<P>Seven stood up abruptly and used the hesitation to her advantage. "B’Elanna,  I need to talk to you to, but it is difficult for me to find the right  words."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s mind reeled at the endless roads that Seven could be going  down.</P>
<P>"Let me go first, it’s important", she pleaded, staring beseechingly at the  pacing ex-drone.</P>
<P>Seven was suddenly alarmed at B’Elanna’s speach. She feared that the  raven-haired klingon had guessed her intentions and was going to thwart her  admission. "No, this is something that I must tell you", she retorted, clasping  her hands behind her back and turning away from B’Elanna, irrationally  frightened by what she was about to say.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stood up in frustration. It was difficult enough to broach the  subject without having to play verbal ping-pong beforehand.</P>
<P>"Seven", she began again, taking a pace toward the blonde Astrometrics  officer.</P>
<P>Seven spun round, determined to voice her thoughts first, so they both saw  shock mirrored in their faces as they simultaneously told each other;</P>
<P>"I love you."</P>

<P>The words appeared to echo around the room as the silence extended. Both  women continued to stare at each other, trying to read the emotions splayed  openly across their faces. Almost involuntarily, B’Elanna took a small step  forward. Seven, her senses heightened by the situation, knew that B’Elanna was  going to move and stepped forward to meet her. The two women now stood well  within their intimate space boundaries but neither cared as their heads tilted  slightly to look into each other’s eyes, conscious that they were breathing the  same shared air.</P>
<P>In slow motion, B’Elanna raised a hand and drew her fingertips across the  ex-drone’s right cheek, brushing the splayed star implant gently before tracing  the outline of Seven’s finely chiselled cheekbone. Seven closed her eyes at the  touch and her breathing became ragged as B’Elanna’s fingers continued their  exploration of her face.</p>
<P>Sensing her reaction, B’Elanna allowed her right hand to rise and trace the  left side of Seven’s face, skimming her fingertips over the optical implant  above Seven’s closed eye, noting how pleasantly warm it felt, almost as if the  metal were alive. Her hands mirrored each other as she brought them across  Seven’s porcelain cheeks before drawing both hands lower to trace the full  cherry lips. Seven’s mouth parted slightly but B’Elanna resisted the urge to be  drawn in, completing her investigation of Seven’s features, touching every  millimetre of the trembling lips and continuing down to the strong jaw-line,  eventually letting her fingers rest at the Borg’s dimpled chin. Softly, she  brushed her thumbs across Seven’s lips again and then extended her neck to allow  their lips to meet. She ran her darker lips lightly over Seven’s with just the  hint of pressure as she kissed first the top and then the lower lip.</p>
<P>Seven’s mouth opened, and again B’Elanna resisted, drawing her lips across  her lover’s lower lip twice more, slightly increasing the pressure each time  before she felt Seven’s hand grip the back of her head and steady her. It was  only then that they finally crushed their lips into each other and pulled  themselves closer, arms snaking round one another, squeezing out the air that  separated them, moulding themselves into each other.</P>
<P>Seven drank the very essence of B’Elanna, her tongue tasting the honeyed lips  as it requested entrance. B’Elanna opened to her and she plundered the Klingon’s  mouth, exploring every crevice and folding her tongue round B’Elanna’s, noticing  absently how much rougher it felt than her own, revelling in the sensations her  lover was giving her. She sucked gently at the engineer’s tongue before  withdrawing slightly and nipping and sucking B’Elanna’s lips, pulling her ever  closer with one hand firmly behind the shorter woman’s head, her other wrapped  around her waist. She could feel the heat radiating off B’Elanna’s body and knew  that her own was just as hot and together, their heat was rising  exponentially.</P>
<P>Eventually, the instinct for oxygen became too strong for the lovers and they  pulled apart, gasping. Seven combed her fingers gently through B’Elanna’s still  damp hair as she gazed deeply into eyes hooded with desire. "I love you B’Elanna  Torres", she repeated softly, watching in delight as a smile lit up her  face.</P>
<P>"I love you too, Seven of Nine, Tertiary adjunct of Unimatrix Zero One", the  Klingon replied flirtatiously, earning a look of enchanted surprise from the  blonde ex-drone. She grinned mischievously. "What? Didn’t you think I’d pay  attention to your full title?" she asked in mock surprise.</P>
<P>"I am honoured that you remember my designation", replied Seven with genuine  reverence. She brought her head down and recaptured the smaller woman’s lips in  a kiss of searing passion. B’Elanna was consumed by the intensity of Seven’s  ardour. She returned the kiss with abandon, feeling her legs give way as it  continued and realising vaguely that she had been spun round and pushed against  a wall, one of Seven’s legs wrapped round hers tightly to keep her upright. She  hung onto her anchor and drank in every sensation, returning the passion  vigorously as her arousal escalated.</p>
<P>Seven could no longer hold back, desperate to touch B’Elanna’s soft caramel  skin and she ran her fully human hand gently down the silky neck, exploring all  the hollows and contours fully before easing her fingers under the fabric of  B’Elanna’s robe. She heard B’Elanna gasp and felt her increase the pressure of  their kiss. Sensing this as silent permission, she allowed her fingers to  continue the exploration, lightly dancing across the top of the engineer’s  chest, noting the start of the swell of her breasts and the valley between them.  She could feel B’Elanna’s skin, slick with ardour, react to her touch and her  hand continued, parting the robe further before she cupped the full weight of  B’Elanna’s left breast in her hand, running her thumb lightly round the dark  areola but careful not to touch the already hardened nub just yet. This touch  elicited a deep groan from B’Elanna and she arched into the contact, breaking  her lips away from Seven. She ached to be explored by this remarkable woman, her  desire pounding furiously at a lower junction.</p>
<P>Heady with the power she was exerting over B’Elanna, Seven teased a bit more,  tracing circles round the erect nipple before gently lowering her mouth, running  her tongue lazily over the pebble and then rolling it gently between her teeth.  She withdrew and continued her exploration with her mouth, sucking the full  breast and nipping at the soft tissue, her ministrations giving the golden skin  a rosy hue. At the same time, she used her Borg-enhanced left hand to tease  B’Elanna’s neglected right breast, squeezing the nipple slightly before kneading  the whole swell.</P>
<P>She heard a deepening growl from the Klingon and smiled into her task,  feeling her own excitement intensify, saturating the crotch of her bio-suit.  Suddenly, she felt B’Elanna move and she was spun around and pinned up against  the wall by a very breathless engineer. She grabbed Seven’s face and kissed her  fiercely, taking control of their interaction in one easy move as the ex-drone  found herself entranced by the display of power B’Elanna had just given. She  could think of no other person who could flaunt such power as gracefully and  deceptively as B’Elanna and her arousal responded to it instantly, her hands  running up and down B’Elanna’s back, pulling her into the embrace as the kiss  continued.</P>
<P>Breathlessly, B’Elanna pulled away from the ravaged lips, using her  fingertips once more to trace their outline. "Seven…my…love… are you sure?"  Unable to articulate the question any more clearly without introducing a sense  of doubt to the Borg, B’Elanna left the question deliberately vague.</P>
<P>Seven understood perfectly though and smiled as she traced the smaller  woman’s brow ridges, fascinated by their beauty. "I have never been so sure of  anything", she whispered softly, piercing B’Elanna with the intensity of her  stare.</P>
<P>The Klingon nodded slightly and then stepped away slightly from the  statuesque blonde, running her hands down Seven’s arms until she reached her  hands. She took them into her own, squeezed them reassuringly and then pulled  Seven towards her as she moved backwards towards her bedroom, unwilling to break  eye contact for even a second.</P>
<P>Seven followed, her breathing shallow, understanding the escalation of their  contact.</p>
<P>Instinctively, B’Elanna felt her way to the bed, turning her lover round so  that the back of Seven’s legs brushed up against it. She moved in closer but  tugged Seven close to keep her upright for a bit longer and brushed her lips  past Seven’s left ear, raking her tongue across the lower lobe before sucking it  into her mouth gently and nibbling for a moment. Her hot breath on Seven’s neck  made the Borg’s hair stand on end as B’Elanna whispered into her ear.</p>
<P>"…you’re over-dressed."</P>
<P>Reflexively, Seven shot her hand up to the back of her neck to release the  hidden clasp. B’Elanna grabbed the hand and led it back down to the drone’s side  before continuing to undress the Borg herself.</P>
<P>She worked her fingers under the fabric and pulled at the bio-suit gently,  parting the material slowly, pulling it inch by inch over the contours of the  ex-drone, and exposing alabaster shoulders to her vision for the first time.  Desperately holding onto her Klingon lust she continued to slowly peel back the  suit, releasing Seven’s voluptuous breasts before removing the sleeves from her  arms. The Chief Engineer paused briefly, drinking in the sight of Seven’s  perfect globes, brushing the back of her hands across them daintily before  sweeping her fingertips across the flat midriff, returning her hands to the  fabric. She had to lower herself down to strip the bio-suit fully from Seven and  she heard a gasp as she bent her knees to continue, keeping her face as close to  Seven as possible, inhaling her intoxicating odour. She marvelled as Seven’s  flesh responded to her hot breath.</p>
<P>Kneeling, she was now even with Seven’s hips and she steadied herself. Slowly  she revealed the creamy hips and golden triangle of curly hair, matted slightly  with Seven’s moisture. As the clothing passed her mound, B’Elanna’s nostrils  were assaulted by unleashed arousal and she paused once again, breathing deeply.  Closing her eyes, she savoured the sweet aroma that had been released.  Provocatively, B’Elanna continued her task, sometimes brushing her fingers over  the skin she uncovered, wondering at the silky smoothness of the curvaceous legs  that hid a powerful musculature.</p>
<P>She reached Seven’s boots and for the first time in what seemed an eternity,  she focused on her own hands, fumbling slightly as she removed the boots,  massaging Seven’s feet and ankles before moving her head back slightly, allowing  her eyes to examine the body she had exposed. She absorbed every feature, every  curve and every trace of Borg circuitry as her eyes steadily rose, eventually  making and holding contact with deep azure eyes that stared intimately back at  her.</P>
<P>Slowly B’Elanna stood up, extending her legs as she continued to fix Seven’s  gaze, delicately running her fingers over the milky white skin as she  straightened. Once upright, she slid her arms around Seven’s waist, raising her  hands behind her to caress her shoulder blades gently. Seven instinctively  wrapped her arms around the engineer as she bent down to join lips again. Their  contact was tender and slow, both women wanting their desire to now build slowly  together.</p>
<P>Imperceptibly, B’Elanna nudged Seven, easing her into a seated position on  the bed before pulling her up towards the head of the bed. Seven raised one leg  and dug a heel in to lever herself towards the centre of mattress, never once  breaking contact with B’Elanna’s lips and tongue, her head swimming with  want.</P>
<P>B’Elanna slowly straddled her lover, her black robe opening, as she placed a  leg either side of Seven’s hips. She broke off the kiss and sat back slightly,  running her hands over the curves of Seven’s breasts before kneading them with  more pressure, raking her fingernails across the painfully erect nipples. Seven  arched into the caress, her belly touching B’Elanna’s wetness and the ex-drone  groaned, appreciating how aroused they both were.</P>
<P>At this contact of her intimate flesh, B’Elanna growled deep in her throat,  convulsively clenching Seven’s ample breasts before making a conscious effort to  lighten her ministrations. She was not going to let her primeval Klingon  instincts take over. She smiled lovingly at Seven and adjusted her position  slightly, sliding down the beautiful Borg’s body, before lowering her lips once  again onto one of Seven’s breasts.</p>
<P>Soft, sensuous lips kissed and nibbled at the alabaster skin, turning it a  dusky rose as the area became aroused by the attention. Seven was truly in the  most exquisite torment, torn between the desire for her lover to continue her  ministrations and the paradox that somewhere far more intimate was pounding with  tension, demanding release.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was in no hurry to leave this paradise of flesh and she divided her  attention evenly between Seven’s firm globes, massaging one with a strong hand  as she lavished attention on the other with her lips, tongue and teeth, grazing  and nipping the flesh. She ran her tongue down the valley between Seven’s  breasts, lapping away the sweat that had pooled there as the Borg became  fevered.</P>
<P>Eventually, she trailed her mouth down, kissing and exploring every inch of  Seven’s tight abdomen, flicking her tongue into the hollow of the navel,  relishing the reaction as she continued her journey. The Klingon’s fingers  remained occupied too. Her right hand paid thorough interest in Seven’s lateral  implant, whilst her left drew lazy circles just underneath her breasts. Both  hands were eventually dragged lower as B’Elanna moved down, running her lips  over Seven’s curly blonde triangle, so close now to actually tasting her. Seven  curved up into B’Elanna’s lips at the touch and she ran her fingers through the  thick raven locks of her lover’s hair, desperate for release but not wanting to  rush her.</P>

<P>As her head paused over Seven’s sex, B’Elanna looked up with lidded eyes,  smouldering with desire. Her hands feeling the adjustment in posture, Seven bent  her head down to lock eyes with B’Elanna, her gaze totally trusting.</P>
<P>B’Elanna ran her hands down Seven’s body slowly before taking the ex-drone’s  and interlacing their fingers. She gave a reassuring squeeze as she rested their  locked hands on Seven’s abdomen and then used her elbows to spread her legs  further apart. She rested her forearms on the soft thighs as she gently lowered  her face into Seven, breathing the scent in deeply once more before placing her  lips onto the swollen folds of Seven’s mons. Delicately kissing them before  opening her mouth and running her tongue through the saturated tissues, she felt  her own moisture start to run down her thighs as she tasted Seven’s sweet honey.  Her tongue continued to lap the moisture as she cleaned the area around Seven’s  sex thoroughly, delving deep into the folds, and lower onto the baby-soft inner  thighs that glistened with evidence of Seven’s arousal.</p>
<P>Softly, she licked the lily-white skin, working back to Seven’s crevice,  feeling her blonde lover squeeze her hands in passionate encouragement. Slowly,  she ran her tongue from the back of Seven’s opening, right through the folds  using the flat of her tongue before the tip of it lightly caressed Seven’s  exposed clitoris, swollen with desire.</p>
<P>Seven bucked at the contact and B’Elanna squeezed their hands reassuringly as  she repeated the process over and over, delighting in the woman’s unrestrained  reactions. As she dragged the tip of her tongue over Seven’s bud, she swirled  round it and gave it more attention, taking it gently into her mouth and  suckling at it daintily, rolling it between her teeth before licking it again.  Feeling yet more moisture lubricate Seven’s folds, she refocused her attention  there before rolling her tongue to probe Seven’s entrance. She pushed in more  firmly and could feel the muscular walls clamp down on her tongue as she  explored Seven’s most secret place.</p>
<P>By now, Seven had clenched B’Elanna’s hands in a vice-like grip of passion.  B’Elanna knew that she could not easily release herself without breaking the  spell so she continued with just her tongue, exploring hungrily, applying firm  pressure with her arms to keep Seven’s hips under control as the Borg bucked  under her ministrations. She returned her tongue to Seven’s pearl, massaging it  with steadily increasing pressure while sensing that she was close to  release.</P>
<P>Seven could no longer control any of her thoughts and knew only on the  sensations B’Elanna was plying her with. There was a pressure building up inside  her that only the Klingon could liberate and every minute movement B’Elanna made  was assisting her. Her breathing came in ragged, forced gasps, almost as an  afterthought. The only thing she could focus on was the woman who was tearing  these sensations from her body and in celebration of her lover; she screamed  B’Elanna’s name in joyous rapture as her orgasm washed over her.</P>
<P>B’Elanna reacted by continuing her work. Drawing a second orgasm quickly out  of the trembling Borg and then a more protracted third, she let her down slowly,  wondering in the reaction she was extracting from Seven.</p>
<P>The lithe blonde shuddered slightly, trying desperately to get a hold on her  thoughts, as B’Elanna moved up to lie next to her, their hands still clasped  tightly together. She opened her eyes and turned her face to look at B’Elanna  tenderly before bringing their hands up and kissing them softly. B’Elanna smiled  at the gesture before putting her mouth to Seven’s and placing a chaste kiss  onto luscious red lips. Seven, tasting her own essence on B’Elanna’s lips,  responded quickly. She turned the innocent caress into a far more sensual  encounter, at last releasing the engineer’s hands in order to wrap her arms  round the coffee-skinned woman and roll on top of her, entwining their legs as  her hands fought to pull off the robe that still hung round B’Elanna’s  shoulders.</P>
<P>B’Elanna helped by rising up slightly and Seven yanked the garment off, at  last exposing the caramel body for her to delight in. She hesitated slightly,  scanning B’Elanna’s body, committing every curve and dip to her eidetic memory  before lowering her head to kiss the engineer voraciously once again, wanting to  return all the sensations she had just experienced to the dynamic Klingon.</p>
<P>Despite the unspent passion in her compact body, B’Elanna used her hands to  gently ease the ex-drone back and look at her wondrously. "Take your time," she  whispered. "We’ve got as long as you want."</P>
<P>Seven grinned as she realised that she had been rushing and instead turned  her thoughts to examining the dark woman’s face, running her fingers all over  her visage; mirroring B’Elanna’s initial actions. Gently, she hooked raven  tresses back behind the Klingon’s ears, pausing when she brushed over the  cortical monitor. She lowered her head closer to the silver shell-like  instrument and then placed her lips next to B’Elanna’s ear. "We’ve almost got  matching accessories," she whispered seductively, earning a loud peal of  delighted laughter from the engineer. It was infectious and Seven found herself  laughing with B’Elanna, burying her face into the Klingon’s neck to smother her  giggles. This made B’Elanna laugh all the more.</P>
<P>Eventually, the moment expired, and the blonde woman raised herself up onto  her elbows. "B’Elanna, I…" she began but stopped as she realised that she didn’t  know how to continue. The lithe engineer placed a gentle hand over the Borg’s  lips. "Shhhh. I know," she responded softly. Delicately, Seven kissed the hand  before reducing the distance between them and kissing the dusky rose lips. This  time, she let the passion build slowly, reacting as B’Elanna reacted, deepening  the kiss as B’Elanna sought more. She could feel the strong engineer wriggle  ecstatically underneath her and without breaking off, she rolled to the  diminutive woman’s left, running her borg-enhanced hand over the now exposed  breasts.</P>
<P>B’Elanna gasped and broke off the kiss as an almost electric sensation surged  through her. Seven grinned as she explained. "My enhancement can be used to  deliver some form of sensation as well as absorb it."</P>
<P>"Lucky you," B’Elanna grinned back at her lover easily. ""What sort of  sensation are you feeding me?"</P>
<P>Seven once again lowered her head to whisper into B’Elanna’s ear. "My  arousal."</P>
<P>B’Elanna groaned in delight and turned her face to capture the blonde woman’s  lips in a searing kiss. Slowly, inexorably, Seven’s hand travelled over the  small round breasts, running the back of her hand over the taut nipples again  and again, revelling in B’Elanna’s reaction and getting a heady sensation from  the feedback she was receiving through the borg-enhanced monitoring.  Reluctantly, her hand left the caramel globes and drifted across B’Elanna’s  midriff, marvelling at the rippling abdominal muscles she could feel under the  coffee skin.</P>
<P>Her hand journeyed further down, making small circles in B’Elanna’s belly  button before touching lower, brushing over the dark damp curls that covered  B’Elanna’s dripping sex.</P>
<P>Looking at B’Elanna lovingly, she trailed her fingers into the nether-lips,  relishing the moisture she found there and gently rubbing her fingers up and  down the Klingon’s valley until Seven found her entrance. She waited, cocking an  enhanced eyebrow for permission. B’Elanna bucked in response so she slowly  pressed two fingers in, pushing as far as she could in one fluid movement.</P>
<P>B’Elanna threw her head back and whipped her body up as she drove herself  into the touch. Encouraged, Seven gently began rhythmically pushing and  retracting her fingers. She could feel the pent up ardour through her sensors  and fed her own desires back into the sensitive area. B’Elanna arched even more  and Seven began to twist her fingers as well, adding a thumb to brush against  the hard swollen clitoris that had pushed out of its protective hood.</P>
<P>Relishing the sensation, Seven moved her head slightly and returned to  B’Elanna’s breasts, sucking and nipping ever harder as she felt the engineer  come closer to the edge. She somehow added a third finger and varied her  motions, twisting and pressing deep into B’Elanna’s core. She felt B’Elanna arch  again and was about to up the tempo once more, to take her to release, when she  realised something was wrong.</p>
<P>She was no longer getting feedback from her enhanced hand.</P>
<P>Raising her head quickly, she watched in horror as the engineer continued to  arch back, her face contorted in spasm, eyes open and unseeing before her whole  body wracked with paroxysm. Seven sat back in alarm and watched petrified, as  B’Elanna continued the seizure. Somehow, she managed to regain her senses and  leapt off the bed, scrabbling for her bio-suit.</p>
<P>Her hands wouldn’t work quickly enough as she searched the clothing for the  hard metal communicator pin. After an eternity, she located it and leapt to the  side of the convulsing woman.</P>
<P>"Medical emergency. Two to transport to Sick Bay immediately."</P>

<p>As the two women materialised in Sick Bay, the Doctor sprang from his office. "Is this a medical emergency or a clothing emergency?" he asked acerbically, noting their nudity.</p>
<p>"Doctor," warned Seven, the anger blazing in her eyes.</p>
<P>Moving to one side to allow the Doctor to approach, he forgot any further comments as he saw that the dark Klingon was still convulsing.</p>
<p>"That’s impossible," he protested, his hands dancing rapidly over a console. "Her cortical monitor is reading normal."</p>
<p>"Treat the patient not the monitor," reminded Seven sharply. Her voice was now rough with emotion as she tried to keep herself together. She was angry for being unable to help her lover herself there was only the Doctor to direct her feelings at.. She concentrated on the task at hand and somehow managed to get the jerking woman into her arms and lift her onto a nearby bio-bed.</p>
<p>Switching to strict professional mode, the EMH prepared a hypospray and began treatment. "Seven, there’s a locker over there. You might want to put a robe on," he suggested absently as he watched the convulsing engineer. Making adjustments on the wedge top of the hypospray, he administered a second dose into the woman’s neck before looking anxiously at his medical tricorder. </p>
<p>Seven ignored his comment. There was no way she was going to leave B’Elanna’s side now, not even for an instant. She felt the hot sting of tears burn her eyes and allowed them to collect on her lashes, the drops building before gravity claimed them and they began to run freely down her burning cheeks. Her stomach contracted and her throat felt raw. Why wasn’t B’Elanna responding?</p>
<p>The Doctor, sensing that he would have to sedate Seven before removing her from Sick Bay, decided to leave her where she stood and worked around her. Frantically, he collated data from the scans he performed, trying to determine the source of the problem, looking up worriedly at the fitting Klingon periodically. He stopped for a fraction, trying to make up his mind over the next course of action. Resolution reconciled itself across his craggy features and he administered a third dose from the hypospray. Finally, the engineer stopped thrashing and lay still on the bio-bed. </p>
<p>Seven let out pent-up breath and roughly wiped her face clear of tears, sniffing repeatedly.</p>
<p>The Doctor, feeling safer with B’Elanna’s paroxysm under control, was confident enough to resume his normal demeanour. "If you had a robe on, you could<BR>use the cuff to wipe your nose."</P>
<P>This time, Seven took the hint, belatedly realising that despite the EMH was quite used to seeing anatomical bodies, it was somewhat unnerving for him to see both B’Elanna and herself in a state of undress. She grabbed a blue silk robe from the locker and another for B’Elanna.</p>
<p>The Doctor looked up, viewing her blotchy tear-stained face with compassion. "Seven, before you ask, I don’t know what’s wrong yet. I’ve rendered her unconscious to minimalise oxygen deprivation. I can now perform some tests safely. Once I’ve got those results, I’ll need to wake her and perform more tests." He stopped as he watched the tall blonde nod glumly, a look of guilt written plainly over her face as she covered the unconscious Klingon.</p>
<p>"Don’t blame yourself Seven," the Doctor advised gently. "It won’t help B’Elanna." </p>
<p>His words provoked Seven to look at him quickly. "She did not suffer seizures before performing the cortical suppressor modifications Doctor," she reminded him, her voice dull. "I am fully aware of who is culpable for her current state." She sniffed again suddenly and then rubbed her sleeve along the bottom of her nose.</p>
<p>The Doctor sighed. He was decidedly uncomfortable at Seven’s state. Hours before, she had the luxury of never having to deal with such deep emotions. It was all very well wanting to feel love and wanting to be in love, but the emotions involved with that state were not always happy. For every extreme of bliss, there could be equal measures of guilt, jealousy and insecurity. Seven was having to deal with these extremes without the one person the Doctor now believed might guide her. He regarded both Seven and B’Elanna as personal friends and had seen their friendship deepen significantly over the last two weeks. He wanted them to be happy. The EMH turned his thoughts back to the task at hand and began to sift through the data.</p>
<p>Seven tried to still her emotions but found herself firmly in their clutches. The time she had spent in B’Elanna’s quarters untethered her feelings for the Klingon hybrid. She had declared her love for the raven-haired woman and had heard the words returned to her. The paradox of the situation made the ex-drone’s heart ache. She had never felt such depth of emotion until B’Elanna had stymied the cortical inhibitor. The close work finding a solution to the problem had allowed them both to recognise and accept the feelings they shared. Now, the process could permanently affect B’Elanna. </p>
<p>The tall Astrometrics Officer's mind was in turmoil. She felt foolish for not considering how *all* her emotions might amplify once the inhibitor had been<BR>removed, guilt included. It was a decidedly unpleasant side-effect of the depth of feeling she had for B'Elanna. It was something she would have to deal with later though because dwelling on these sensations now, would not help the Chief Engineer.</p>
<p>Taking several shuddering breaths, she found a new focus and gently removed the cortical monitor from behind the unconscious woman’s ear, placing it on a workstation. The Doctor had said that it had shown normal readings. Recalling earlier events, Tom Paris had stated that his tricorder displayed normal parameters the first time B’Elanna reacted. </p>
<P>Was there a connection or was it purely coincidence?</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye, the doctor saw Seven move to a console and begin work. He nodded in satisfaction.</P>
<P>The doors to Sick Bay hissed open and Captain Janeway strode in. She had heard the emergency transmission and came down to check on her Engineering Chief. </p>
<p>"Doctor, what’s wrong with her?" she asked without preamble, even as her eyebrows raised slightly at seeing Seven standing at a console wearing a short robe instead of her normal bio-suit.</p>
<p>"That’s what I’m trying to determine," the EMH replied testily. There was a perfectly good communications system in place. Why did the Captain insist on checking in person?</p>
<p>"Perhaps I should re-phrase that," Janeway remarked. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"B’Elanna suffered another seizure," answered Seven from her console. "I was with her so transported straight here." For a reason that escaped her for the time being, Seven felt reluctant to go into details about her relationship with B’Elanna.<br>Not until she was well enough to share the telling perhaps.</p>
<p>Janeway looked at Seven through narrowed thoughtful eyes. There was more behind this episode, but now was not the time or place to delve deeper. "Perhaps we should leave the Doctor to his tests?" she suggested.</p>
<p>"I am not leaving Sick Bay yet. I have tests of my own to run." Seven didn’t look up as she spoke, running a correlative set of analyses.</P>
<p>The Captain tried again. "Seven, you’re still tired after the procedure. You shouldn’t be working."</p>
<p>Seven’s eyes came up to meet the Captain’s with a blaze of fury. Remarkably, she held control of her voice and her tone remained cool as she replied. "Captain, I am well aware of my own condition. However it is not I who lies sedated on a bio-bed. I need to do this."</p>
<p>The Captain blanched at the vitriol lacing Seven’s words. However, it had taken years of training to become a Starfleet captain and she was well used to the arguments of her crew now. "Seven, if you overwork yourself now, what use will you be to B’Elanna when she wakes? You need time to recover," she reminded the ex-drone.</p>
<p>"If I am overwhelmed by my exertions then I am in the right location for treatment," Seven rebutted logically.</p>
<p>"And you’ll succeed in diverting the Doctor from treating B’Elanna," riposted Janeway.</p>
<p>"Then assign Mr Paris to Sick Bay," snapped Seven, tired of the manipulation the Captain was attempting. "I am staying here," she stated with finality.</p>
<p>Realising she’d get no further with Seven, Janeway turned to the Doctor. "Are you happy for Seven to remain here?" she asked.</P>
<p>"I agree that she needs to regenerate Captain," the Doctor answered. "But I suspect that she has higher priorities at this time and I have no objection to her working on them," he continued cryptically.</p>
<p>Seven looked up gratefully and gave a tiny nod towards the physician, indicating her thanks for his understanding. Janeway noticed the gesture and finally comprehended the dynamic between the ex-drone and her Chief Engineer. Disgusted with the burning jealousy she felt toward the unconscious Klingon, the Captain decided that it was time to retreat.</p>
<p>"Keep me informed Doctor," she advised before leaving, barely sparing a glance for Seven.</p>
<p>The EMH and Seven worked on their own tasks in silence but Sick Bay gave out reassuring beeps from the devices monitoring B’Elanna and Seven found herself registering every sound as she continued to plough through the data, looking for anything that might help her stricken lover.</p>
<p>"Seven, I’m going to wake B’Elanna now," the Doctor advised, startling her out of her study. She nodded and approached the bio-bed, grasping B’Elanna’s hand in both of hers.</p>
<p>The EMH placed the hypospray at B’Elanna’s neck and injected its contents. For a second, nothing happened. Then the dark lashes fluttered and B’Elanna opened her eyes hesitantly. She turned her head slightly to focus on the woman squeezing her hand tightly.</p>
<p>"Hi," she began softly, smiling weakly. </p>
<p>The single word brought tears to Seven’s eyes but she blinked them back rapidly as she returned the greeting, her voice hoarse with emotion. "I’m sorry B’Elanna."</p>
<p>A look of confusion stole across the dark engineer’s face. "What happened?" she asked, glancing back towards the Doctor.</p>
<p>"You suffered another seizure B’Elanna," the EMH supplied. "I don’t know why yet. I ran a set of tests while you were sedated but I need to do some comparative analyses while you’re conscious. Hopefully, with those results we can work out what’s going on and do something about it," he continued softly.</p>
<p>"So I’m stuck in Sick Bay then?" she asked resignedly.</p>
<p>"For the time being, yes," he replied.</P>
<p>B’Elanna turned back to Seven as she felt the pressure on her hand increasing. "Why are you sorry?" she asked the tall blonde, placing her other hand over Seven’s.</p>
<p>"If I had not proceeded with this project, you would not be in this predicament," Seven replied brokenly, overwrought.</p>
<p>"Shhhh sweetheart, don’t blame yourself," soothed the recumbent engineer. "I told you from the start that I was prepared to do this for you."</p>
<p>"You are injured, B’Elanna," Seven protested. "Perhaps permanently."</p>
<p>"Well let’s wait and see on that one. Don’t you realise that I would have done this regardless of the risk? I’ve loved you far longer than since this project began." B’Elanna only realised as the words came out how true they really were. She smiled warmly at Seven.</p>
<p>"I cannot say the same simply because of the inhibitor B’Elanna," replied Seven apologetically. "But if it’s any consolation, I can find no adverb to describe the<BR>depth of love I feel for you now. I just hope that we can continue to share and explore those depths," she finished poetically, drawing a tear from B’Elanna’s eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh we will, honey, we will," the raven-haired engineer reassured her.</p>
<p>"Touching though this scene is," the Doctor interrupted, "I still have work to do," he explained as two pairs of irritated eyes scorched him.</p>
<p>Seven nodded in understanding. "I need to finish my analysis too," she stated. She squeezed her lover’s hands tightly. "I’ll only be at the other console," she reassured. </p>
<p>B’Elanna smiled and then frowned as she thought on what had been said. "Is there anything I can do to help?"</p>
<p>"No!" Seven and the Doctor replied in unison. B’Elanna pulled a face and was about to protest when she realised that she was outnumbered. She realised that she felt exhausted so settled back and allowed her eyes to close while she listened to the other occupants of Sick Bay bustling around. The Doctor prodded her unceremoniously and she opened one eye irritably.</p>
<p>"What?" </p>
<p>"I wanted you awake for these tests," the EMH reminded her shortly. Grumbling, B’Elanna adjusted position slightly, knowing that if she stayed in a more uncomfortable position she was less likely to drop off. It also gave her the opportunity to gaze at Seven and for that, she was thankful. Her heart quickened as she watched the tall blonde’s graceful movements, the barest trace of a frown furrowing her forehead.</p>
<p>"Not that my opinion ever counted for much, but I think you suit each other perfectly," the Doctor whispered in her ear discretely, making B’Elanna flush to her hairline.</p>
<p>"Thanks Doc, I appreciate it," she smiled back at him.</p>
<p>"As do I," agreed Seven and then quirked her eybrow toward the Doctor, earning a snort of laughter from B’Elanna and an aggrieved grunt from the EMH as he continued with the tests.</p>
<p>"I still can’t work out why your monitor failed to warn me that anything was wrong," the Doctor commented conversationally as he worked his console.</p>
<p>"I am trying to ascertain if there is a link between that and Mr Paris’ tricorder readings," Seven told him from where she stood.</p>
<p>"Do you think it might have something to do with it getting wet?" asked B’Elanna sheepishly.</p>
<p>"What?" exploded the Doctor in disbelief. </p>
<p>"I took a shower and I didn’t want to take the monitor off," explained B’Elanna hurriedly, cringing at the EMH’s reaction.</p>
<p>"Well that’s got to go down in the Ship’s Log," retorted the Doctor sarcastically. "Since when did delicate scientific monitoring equipment like getting wet?"</p>
<p>"Oh come on Doc," protested B’Elanna. "That stuff ought to be impervious to all sorts of nastiness."</p>
<p>"Do not worry B’Elanna, the monitor is functioning correctly," interjected Seven. She looked up sadly at both of her companions. "I’m afraid I have an answer to your predicament," she stated in a dull voice.</p>
<p>The Doctor left B’Elanna and joined Seven at her console, looking at her data quickly. B’Elanna, frightened by Seven’s tone did not want to go over there and remained paralysed on the bio-bed. She watched carefully as she saw the EMH look up to glance at her before returning his eyes to the screen. She noted how still Seven stood, waiting for a reaction from the Doctor, her azure eyes darting between him and B’Elanna rapidly.</p>
<p>The Doctor rubbed his face with his hands as he thought about what he’d just read. He then walked back to B’Elanna’s bed and looked at her carefully. "It seems that our Borg nanoprobes have a sense of irony," he began.</p>
<p>"Just tell me Doc," instructed B’Elanna, sitting up and pulling her robe tightly round her.</p>
<p>"During your link-up, it would appear the nanoprobes analysed your own neural readings and have somehow tampered with the synaptic pathways. The alterations<BR>trigger a cascade failure of the junctions whenever there is a build up of certain chemicals in your body."</p>
<p>"Which chemicals?" B’Elanna asked, a sense of dread creeping over her.</p>
<p>The Doctor sighed. "I can’t be certain without further testing, but adrenaline and noradrenaline seem to be favourites at the moment," the EMH replied. "There may be others," he added.</p>
<p>B’Elanna laughed mirthlessly. "Talk about cripple a Klingon," she remarked. "So what’s the prognosis?" she pursued, her pragmatism taking control.</p>
<p>"Again, difficult to tell at this early stage," the Doctor hedged.</p>
<p>B’Elanna flicked her eyes over to where Seven stood, watching the exchange nervously. She smiled at her shyly. "I could use a hug," she suggested softly. </p>
<p>Seven sprang to the dark woman’s side and pulled her into a fierce hold.</p>
<p>"Don’t stay away from me now Seven," B’Elanna whispered into the distraught woman’s hair. "I need your help."</p>
<p>Seven squeezed her tighter, signifying her understanding. "I love you," she whispered back.</p>

<P>Kathryn Janeway pinched the bridge of her nose with her right hand and squeezed her eyes tight as she allowed herself a few moments to process the report the Doctor had delivered. Finally, she looked up at the EMH who sat opposite her in the Briefing Room, absently rotating his data padd on the table. She wondered when the hologram had decided to include fidgeting as part of his programming.</P>
<P>"Let me get this right Doctor," she began, leaning forward onto her elbows. "B’Elanna’s neural pathways have been booby-trapped by the nanoprobes so that when she generates excessive neuro-chemicals, the pathways break down and she suffers a seizure, correct?"</P>
<P>The EMH nodded in affirmation, his hands stilling.</P>
<P>"And the chemicals that the nanoprobes have used for a trigger are generated when she’s under extreme stress or emotion?" Janeway continued.</P>
<P>"Correct, Captain. Anything from an emergency in Engineering to the throes of passion." The Doctor couldn’t resist referring to Seven and B’Elanna’s relationship, knowing how much it needled Janeway.</P>
<P>The captain chose to ignore the comment and considered all the aspects of the problem. "Why did the monitor and tricorder show normal readings during these episodes?" she asked, speculating if this could perhaps generate a solution.</P>
<P>"The synapse breakdown is hidden by the forced generation of another chemical. Because of the way we scan for medical information, everything that we expect to see is there, so the problem goes undetected. It’s quite alarming to discover that an age old method of examination is intrinsically faulty," the EMH explained. "Seven has gone through all the medical instrumentation and made adjustments so that this sort of thing won’t recur."</p>
<P>Janeway tapped her lips with her index finger, an indication of the tension she felt. "So how do we resolve this?" she asked. Her eyes snapped up when the EMH failed to respond. "Doctor?"</p>
<P>"The simple answer is that I don’t know yet. The information I have is too patchy to provide exact figures or potential solutions." He fidgeted nervously in his seat, unwilling to continue.</P>
<P>"Go on," Janeway prompted, lowering her voice commandingly.</P>
<P>"Now that we can monitor B’Elanna’s condition more effectively, I may have to induce another seizure in order to obtain the data I need to provide a solution," the dark craggy hologram finished, clearly uncomfortable with the idea.</P>
<P>"Isn’t that dangerous?" Janeway sat back, the suggestion making her feel decidedly uncomfortable.</P>
<P>"Of course it’s dangerous. Every time she has a seizure, the oxygen supply to her brain is reduced, potentially risking hypoxic damage, not to mention the breakdown of her neural pathways," he retorted angrily. "Captain, I am working on ways to solve this, but you need to know that as of this moment, I’m not sure that her condition is curable."</p>
<P>Janeway stared at the EMH for a few moments, considering her options.</P>
<P>"In view of the circumstances, I’ve decided to relieve her of duty as Chief Engineer," the Captain informed him. "Knowing B’Elanna, that will be all the stimulus she needs to trigger an emotional outburst," she continued grimly.</P>
<P>"I’m not so sure, Captain. From the sketchy information I received from Seven regarding the events leading to this last episode, the term ‘extreme’ is quite accurate. I suspect that B’Elanna’s already considered the possibility of restricted duty. It might not be enough of a trigger," the Doctor disputed.</P>
<P>Janeway hid her emotions well, leaving her face a mask of neutrality as her mind considered exactly what it was that Seven and B’Elanna were doing to prompt a seizure. "What would you suggest then, an artificial increase in adrenaline?"</P>
<P>"Exactly, Captain," the EMH confirmed, impressed with the Captain’s grasp of the problem.</P>
<P>"Is she still in Sick Bay?" queried Janeway.</P>
<P>"Yes. Despite Seven’s scanning modifications, I’m not willing to take the risk and allow her to leave, not yet anyway. Besides, other than getting ‘stir-crazy’, there’s little chance of her suffering another convulsion while she remains there. I just hope Sick Bay and I can survive her prolonged stay," the Doctor finished sardonically.</P>
<P>"I ought to pay her a visit," Janeway resigned herself.</P>

<P>"It’s up to you when you want to visit Captain," the EMH replied, "but at the moment, B’Elanna is exhausted with the after-effects of her seizure and the sedative I administered. When I left to come here, she was sleeping naturally. It might not hurt to wait till morning," he suggested.</P>
<P>Janeway considered his proposal before her mind switched focus slightly. "Where’s Seven?"</P>
<P>The Doctor grimaced slightly. "After a lot of persuasion from both B’Elanna and myself, Seven has returned to her alcove to regenerate. I have no idea how long she’ll stay there but she needs at least sixteen hours," he explained. "The one consolation out of this situation is that she has no complications post-surgery. Although it is a little early to be certain, I speculate that she will recover completely and live a normal *emotional* life."</P>
<P>The Captain nodded at that. It was the least that Seven deserved and she told the EMH her sentiment.</P>
<P>"I concur, but things are more problematic now that B’Elanna has difficulties," the bald man demurred.</p>
<P>"B’Elanna isn’t the only friend Seven has on Voyager," Janeway protested. "There are a number of people she can turn to for assistance adjusting to her new emotions."</P>
<P>"Quite so, but I believe that B’Elanna is the only one she truly trusts her emotions with." The Doctor hurried on as he saw the Captain begin to object. "Seven thinks that she has already harmed B’Elanna and won’t want to put her in any further danger by bombarding her with her own emotions." The EMH sat back once he finished.</P>
<P>"All the more reason for her to approach one of her other friends then," Janeway reasoned.</P>
<P>The Doctor resisted sighing but wondered if the Captain was being deliberately obtuse about the subject.</P>
<P>"It looks like I need to pay a number of visits," Janeway continued. She glanced at the chronometer and was startled by the lateness of the hour. "Thank you Doctor," she dismissed the hologram gently. "I’ll leave B’Elanna to sleep and Seven to regenerate. I’ll visit Sick Bay in the morning. If there is any change though…"</P>
<P>"I’ll keep you apprised Captain," the EMH finished as he rose.</p>
<P>Janeway reached for her coffee cup and drained the contents, shuddering as she realised how cold the contents had become. She spun her chair round and returned the black and silver cup to the replicator and then left the Briefing Room purposefully and strode towards the turbolift.</P>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<P>Captain Janeway stood and stared at the empty alcoves for a full minute. The children were at Sam Wildman's quarters for the evening, spending time with her, Neelix and Naomi. Seven was noticeable by her absence.</P>
<P>"Computer, locate Seven of Nine," the Captain ordered.</p>
<P>"Seven of Nine is in Lieutenant B’Elanna Torres’ quarters," the disembodied voice replied unemotionally.</P>
<P>Janeway frowned and punched out another question, her heart lurching in anticipation of the answer. "Locate B’Elanna Torres."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres is in Sick Bay," the computer replied in a monotone. Janeway allowed herself to breathe again, even as her mind whirled over her next actions and their possible consequences. Resolved, she marched quickly out of Cargo Bay Two and back down the corridor towards the turbolift.</P>
<P>She pressed the door chime and waited a few seconds, astonished at how nervous she felt. When there was no answer, Janeway scanned the corridor quickly, checking for any onlookers, before bending over slightly to punch in an override code. Smartly, she stepped through the doors as they hissed open. A quick glance around the Chief Engineer’s quarters revealed little to the Captain. Everything in the living area was tidy. Once the door shut behind her, Janeway called out. "Seven?" Stepping more centrally into the room, she called the Astrometrics Officer’s name again.</P>
<P>Seven heard her name called and groaned as she forced her eyes open. Realising where she was and the owner of the voice, she decided that it would not be prudent to walk out of B’Elanna’s bedroom without clothing so she grabbed the robe that B’Elanna had discarded by the bed during their love-making and shrugged it over her shoulders. As the lithe blonde tied the black robe carefully round her waist, she caught the smell of the engineer and she paused to savour it. Closing her eyes momentarily, she pressed the material into her face, inhaling deeply.</p>
<P>Tugging the robe round her more tightly, as if it could offer protection in the same way B’Elanna could, Seven padded softly from the engineer’s bedroom to greet Janeway.</P>
<P>"Captain," she acknowledged, her tone indicating her surprise at Janeway’s presence.</P>
<P>"Sorry to disturb you Seven," Janeway began, her throat dry as she drank in the vision that stood before her. The black robe contrasted starkly with the tall woman's alabaster skin, particularly the V shaped area where the robe crossed over her breasts. It was tied in tight, highlighting the narrow waist and curvaceous hips and the shortness of the garment served to accentuate the length of Seven's legs. The younger woman's golden hair was free from its usual bindings and looked tousled and soft, and her cobalt blue eyes were puffy from sleep, yet undeniably alluring.</p>
<P>"Captain, is something wrong? Has something happened to B’Elanna?" Seven's voice increased in both volume and pitch as she asked the questions.</P>
<P>Janeway put a hand out to still the questions and responded quickly. "No, no, B’Elanna's fine. I just wanted to come and speak with you," she explained. "I think I’ll come back another time and let you get back to sleep." Janeway allowed herself a bolt-hole for escape, chastising herself for even coming here.</p>
<P>Before she moved to leave, the older woman decided to appease her curiosity, though an inner voice told her that the answer would be painful to hear. "The Doctor told me you were regenerating. Why are you sleeping in B’Elanna's quarters?"</P>
<P>Seven surprised Janeway by moving to the couch and sitting down, curling her long legs up underneath her and adjusting the short dark robe to cover herself.</p>
<P>"I returned to the Cargo Bay and spent some time with the children before regeneration. Once they were in the care of Ensign Wildman, my emotions ‘got the better of me’ and I felt the need to be close to B’Elanna." Seven swallowed before continuing, trying to reign in her emotions once again. "I came here as I did not want to disturb B’Elanna in Sick Bay. I found comfort from lying in B’Elanna’s bed so I decided to sleep here. It is a less efficient means of regeneration compared to the alcove but I found it preferable." Even as she spoke, Seven realised that it was the second night in a row that she had slept, wondering if it held any significance.</P>
<P>Janeway moved over to the couch and sat at the other end. "I’ve just had a meeting with the Doctor," she told the ex-drone carefully, keeping an expression of compassion on her face. "B’Elanna’s ‘condition’ may be incurable," she continued, watching the blonde woman’s visage intently for any expression of emotion. She was not disappointed.</p>
<P>Seven closed her eyes briefly at the statement as a pained look washed over her. "The Doctor advised me that there may be a problem, but he neglected to mention its severity," she replied, her voice barely louder than a whisper.</P>
<P>Janeway placed her hand on the Borg’s leg in a gesture of sympathy. "Seven, the next few days are going to be extremely hard on you. You’ve just been given access to all your emotions and they are going to make themselves felt, believe me." Janeway squeezed Seven’s leg gently as she continued. "Now that B’Elanna is in danger when she is dealing with extreme emotion, you need to search your own feelings about your relationship with her. Is your ‘interaction’ likely to cause more harm than good whilst she’s in this state?" She looked enquiringly at the young drone.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, B’Elanna needs me," protested Seven.</P>
<P>"Are you sure she needs all that intense emotion Seven?" Janeway asked gently. "Can you deal with the idea that your presence might put her in danger?"</P>
<P>Seven looked unblinking at her superior officer as she considered her words.</P>
<P>The Captain continued softly. "I’m here if you need support or you need to talk about anything," she offered.</P>
<P>Seven stared back dolefully. "I feel so helpless Kathryn," she whispered, allowing her eyes to fill with tears.</p>
<P>Instantly, Janeway swept the woman into her arms and hugged her tightly. "Let it go Seven," she advised as she rocked her gently. "Let it go." She felt Seven’s shoulders shudder slightly and then heave as the tears came and flooded through the distraught woman.</P>
<P>Seven felt confused and hurt. She was angry with herself for putting B’Elanna in peril but she had no one else who understood her so totally and selflessly. Her self-loathing spiralled downward. She longed to be held by B’Elanna and then berated herself for her selfishness and disregard for the well-being of the woman she loved. These emotions were raw and painful for her and tears wracked through her body. In turmoil, she hung onto the one anchor she had, Kathryn Janeway.</p>
<P>The Captain continued to hug her and stroke her back gently, uttering nonsense words to soothe and reassure the distressed woman. Softly, she stroked the long golden tresses and waited.</P>
<P>Eventually, the tears subsided but Janeway continued to hold her companion, projecting her own strength and love toward the young woman.</P>
<P>To Kathryn, it was only a natural progression to tilt the Borg’s chin up slightly so that she could look at her tear-ravaged face. As soon as she set eyes on her visage, Janeway knew that she was no longer in control of her actions and she brushed her lips across the full quivering mouth of Seven of Nine.</P>
