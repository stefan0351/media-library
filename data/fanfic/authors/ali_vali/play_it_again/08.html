  The seashell in her hand was looked over thoroughly by Poppy before it joined
  the other ones in the bucket. Julia sat watching them from the porch of their
  bungalow with Ginger, Matlin and Elizabeth. It was their third summer on the
  island, and the first where Tallulah was old enough to truly enjoy it. </P>
<P>&quot;That&#146;s prettier than the last one Tully,&quot;
  said Poppy. The tall woman sat on her heels and praised her daughter for her
  latest find. The older the child got, the more she looked like Julia. Poppy
  wasn&#146;t sure what Tallulah&#146;s biological father looked like, but it
  was clear from the long blonde curly hair and big green eyes that she had gotten
  all her physical attributes, as well as her personality, from her mother. &quot;But
  the prettiest shell out here is you, my little beach bum.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I love you Poppy,&quot; said Tallulah. She laughed
  when Poppy hoisted her in the air and propped her on her shoulders. &quot;I
  love you too buttercup. Let&#146;s you and me get cleaned up so we can go sing.&quot;
  Tallulah clapped her hands before grabbing two fists full of hair for the ride
  to the porch.</P>
<P>Julia watched them walk up from the beach together. She
  was sure if the little girl riding high had asked Poppy to drop to her knees
  and eat sand, her big softie would have done it. It didn&#146;t matter what
  her daughter was doing, when she heard Poppy&#146;s deep voice it became the
  center of her world. In turn, Poppy was wild about her daughter, and legally
  that was who Tallulah was. She walked to the railing to wait for her two of
  her favorite people, and melted a little when the blue eyes fixed on her. In
  the garden under her were now yellow rose bushes mingled in with the wildflowers
  growing there. &quot;What&#146;s your name little girl?&quot; she asked Tallulah
  who was almost at eye level with her considering where she was perched.</P>
<P>&quot;Tallulah Carly Valente, mama you know that.&quot;
  Julia smiled up at her as she watched the blonde curls being blown around in
  the breeze. Tallulah would be petite like her, and Julia thought that like her,
  Tallulah had also lost her heart to Poppy.</P>
<P>&quot;That&#146;s true, I knew that. Now go wash some
  of that sand off you before you go in the house.&quot; Ginger got up and walked
  the little girl to the outside shower to help her clean off. &quot;What about
  you big girl, who do you belong to?&quot; Julia asked Poppy.</P>
<P>&quot;You and nobody else but you,&quot; sang Poppy.
  Elizabeth and Matlin continued talking as the couple exchanged a sweet kiss.
  It was no fun for them to make fun of the much in love couple. Matlin had often
  told them they could give someone diabetes if in their company long enough.</P>
<P>&quot;I missed you baby, even though I could see you
  the whole time. I think your son did too,&quot; said Julia pointing at the baby
  lying on the blanket by her feet. Raphael Rayford Valente was six months old,
  and true perfection to his two mothers. Compared to his sister, Rafe was a bruiser.
  Born with a full head of curly black hair, Rafe was big for his age. The only
  thing that linked him to Julia and Tallulah was the green eyes. It had taken
  months but they had finally found an anonymous donor with all of Poppy&#146;s
  characteristics. They had both wanted other children, but Julia wanted them
  to favor her spouse as well. Julia wanted to keep trying, to see if she could
  match the Valente eye color eventually.</P>
<P>&quot;I promise to make it up to you later baby. A command
  performance for an audience of one,&quot; said Poppy, as she stretched up a
  bit to reach Julia&#146;s lips. </P>
<P>&quot;I&#146;ll hold you to that Valente.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;Hi my name is Poppy, and I&#146;d like to welcome
  you to Poppy&#146;s. Now you know where the name came from,&quot; said Poppy
  into the microphone in front of her. Poppy looked out on a number of friendly
  faces out in the audience, and enjoyed the fact she was back on one of her favorite
  stages. The bar on the resort that carried her name was the only place that
  didn&#146;t follow the understated class the rest of the buildings had. Poppy&#146;s
  looked and felt like one of the joints she had played in college. You came here
  to sit drink beer, and sing along with whoever was up and playing. For a month
  every summer since they had opened, that&#146;s where you could find Poppy every
  afternoon. The three women there that night that had known her the longest,
  were glad to see Poppy hadn&#146;t lost that old spark. Matlin, Ginger and Elizabeth
  sat back with a cold beer and prepared to enjoy their friend&#146;s first set.</P>
<P>&quot;I want to start out tonight with a song that I
  recently ran across and it reminded me of someone I loved once, and lost to
  cancer. This week is the anniversary of her death and I want her to know that
  wherever she might be I still think of her every now and then.&quot;</P>
<I>
<P>I walked down to the park last night</P>
<P>Warm breeze stirring up a soft moonlight</P>
<P>And my mind started drifting to way back when</P>
<P>Yes I do think about you every now and then</P>
<P>The other day I saw a car like you used to drive </P>
<P>I got a funny feeling down deep inside </P>
<P>And for the briefest moment I felt a smile begin</P>
<P>Yes I do think about you ever now and then</P>
<P>I love my life and I&#146;d never trade</P>
<P>Between what you and me had and the life I&#146;ve made</P>
<P>She&#146;s here and she&#146;s real, but you were too</P>
<P>And every once in a while I think about you</P>
<P>I heard a song on the radio just yesterday</P>
<P>The same one you always asked me to play</P>
<P>And when the song was over </P>
<P>I wished they&#146;d played it again</P>
<P>Yes I do think about you every now an then</P>
<P>I love my life and I&#146;d never trade</P>
<P>Between what you and me had and the life I&#146;ve made</P>
<P>She&#146;s here and she&#146;s real, but you were too</P>
<P>And every once in a while I think about you</P>
<P>I&#146;ve been layin&#146; here all night listenin&#146;
  to the rain</P>
<P>Talkin&#146; to my heart and trying to explain</P>
<P>Why sometimes I catch myself</P>
<P>Wondering what might have been</P>
<P>Yes I do think about you every now and then</P>
<P>Every now and then</P>
<P>Every now and then</P>
</I>
<P>When the last chords of the song had left her guitar,
  Poppy felt the weight on her shoulders and recognized it as the arms of her
  wife. Julia just kissed her neck, and smiled at Elizabeth in the audience over
  Poppy&#146;s shoulder. Carly&#146;s daughter had needed to hear the song, just
  as much as Poppy had needed to sing it. Julia knew that, like the line in the
  song Poppy had just finished, there was the briefest of moments every year when
  she needed to share the woman she loved with the one that had come before her.
  She only hoped that they could raise their children with as much integrity as
  their other mother had. </P>
<P>Later that night after they had put Tallulah and Rafe
  to bed, Poppy and Julia walked along the shoreline looking out into the clear
  night. In the distant sky a brilliant shooting star lit up the darkness for
  a brief moment giving the two lovers a celestial fireworks display. They didn&#146;t
  need to wish for anything more.</P>
<P>When they went to bed, Poppy sang Julia her own love
  song. A love song that had no words except for those that Poppy whispered in
  her ear, and showed the small blonde that her tall hero had eyes only for her.</P>
