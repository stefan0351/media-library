<P>Miguel was waiting for the shuttles the next afternoon with Rayford by his
  side. Poppy had commissioned four vessels, each a little different so that they
  would accommodate different guests&#146; tastes. You could travel the two hours
  to the island either in air-conditioned comfort, or you could get there a little
  faster in one of the open-air boats that fit less passengers. Ginger and Matlin
  where the only two on board the fastest boat. By the load of luggage they carried,
  Miguel figured they were there for only a short stay. He had reserved one of
  the bungalows with a nice stretch of beach behind it for the two friends. <I>It&#146;s
  a wonder they aren&#146;t wearing white gloves</I>, thought Miguel as he waved
  to them as the boat neared. He had been at openings when the two had attended,
  hopefully his prayers from the night before would be answered, and they would
  stay calm.</P>
<P>"Hi Miguel, it&#146;s nice to see you again," said Ginger as she accepted his
  help off the boat. "And you Miss Ginger, it is nice to see the two of you again,"
  answered Miguel. </P>
<P>The ladies gave both Miguel and Rayford hugs once they were onshore, and accepted
  the men&#146;s invitation for an escort to their bungalow. The rest of the guests
  would be arriving within the hour, and they still had much to plan, but a bad
  word from these two women would go straight to Poppy&#146;s ear.</P>
<P>Matlin walked slowly behind the group, taking the time to look around. There
  were so many memories here on this island that she personally hadn&#146;t experienced,
  but had heard about from Carly. The saddest part of the coming week was that
  Carly wouldn&#146;t be there to celebrate with them. The three of them had done
  the finishing touches to the d&eacute;cor of the bungalows; it was one of the
  last things Carly did before she had died. They had laughed together that month
  like they had when they were children. <I>May we all go into that good night
  with as much class and courage as you my friend. I miss you Carly</I>, thought
  Matlin. </P>
<P>By six that evening the pool area was full, and the staff was doing an admirable
  job of keeping up with requests. Rayford was busy at the front desk, but had
  taken the time to escort Julia and Tallulah to one of the tables to meet Ginger
  and Matlin. The two older women had asked about her as soon as they had seen
  Rayford, and insisted Julia join them for drinks. It was Julia that first noticed
  the empty barstool by the pool, and the tall woman with a guitar heading for
  it. When the old friends looked to see what the young woman was staring at,
  both their eyes misted it up. </P>
<P>"Good afternoon ladies and gentleman, and welcome to Carly&#146;s Sound. The
  staff and I hope that you enjoy your stay," said Poppy. She sat down in the
  stool Miguel had sat out for her and took a moment to get comfortable. There
  were butterflies in her stomach, so she thought the best course of action was
  to just get started.</P>
<I>
<P>This old guitar taught me to sing a love song</P>
<P>It showed me how to laugh and how to cry</P>
<P>It introduced me to some friends of mine</P>
</I>
<P>Poppy looked toward Ginger and Matlin&#146;s table and smiled. It was nice
  to see them again and to see that they had taken the time to invite Julia. As
  Poppy headed into the next verse she felt a weight settle onto her back, and
  her smile grew bigger. Carly was back and had taken the place she had so many
  times before when Poppy was singing her a love song. </P>
<I>
<P>And brightened up some days</P>
<P>It helped me through some lonely nights</P>
<P>Oh what a friend to have on a cold and lonely night</P>
<P>This old guitar gave me my lovely lady</P>
<P>It opened her eyes and ears to me</P>
<P>It brought us close together </P>
<P>And I guess it broke her heart </P>
<P>It opened up the space for us to be</P>
<P>What a lovely place and lovely space to be</P>
<P>This old guitar gave me my life my living</P>
<P>All the things you know I love to do</P>
<P>To serenade the stars that shine from a sunny mountainside</P>
<P>Most of all to sing my songs for you</P>
<P>I love to sing my songs for you</P>
<P>Yes I do, you know</P>
<P>I love to sing my songs for you</P>
</I>
<P>She finished the song to strong applause then launched into some livelier rock
  and roll songs. Two hours later, Poppy&#146;s voice was a little raspier, and
  the people around the pool were a little drunker. Some of them knew who had
  been entertaining them and slapped Poppy on the back as she made her way to
  Ginger and Matlin&#146;s table. </P>
<P>The adoring look on Julia&#146;s face as Poppy got closer, was not missed by
  Matlin. "She&#146;s hotter than a Rolex in a pawn shop, ain&#146;t she?" Matlin
  leaned over and whispered in the young woman&#146;s ear. The blush on Julia&#146;s
  face confirmed Matlin&#146;s suspicions. Poppy stopped behind the empty chair
  at their table and bowed deeply at the waist. It had bee several months since
  she had seen Carly&#146;s old friends. After finishing with the New Orleans
  Ritz, they had taken a deserved vacation through Europe. </P>
<P>"Poppy you must have done something wonderful in your last life girl to get
  all this wonderful karma. No one is this good looking, talented and charming
  without being burned at the stake or some other nonsense people used to do to
  each other. Come over here and give us both a hug," demanded Ginger. </P>
<P>"Hmmm I see being dead has changed a few things," commented Carly. She watched
  as Ginger then Matlin greeted Poppy with a hug then a kiss on the lips.</P>
<P>"Ladies it&#146;s nice seeing you two again. You have to tell me later how
  Europe was, but I have a conference call with Lizzy in twenty minutes. Something
  to do with the Fort Lauderdale location, so I have to run," said Poppy. She
  cut off any complaints before they began. As she kissed the women again, Rayford
  walked up and put his hands on Julia&#146;s shoulders possessively. </P>
<P>"How are all my girls doing?" he asked. He directed his comment to all the
  women seated at the table. The assistant manager seemed almost displeased that
  the singer was standing at the table talking. "Don&#146;t you have work to do?"
  Rayford asked Poppy. He wanted Matlin to see how well he handled the employees,
  before asking for a transfer back to the states.</P>
<P>"Sorry Mr. Johnson, how careless of me to be goofing off on the company clock,"
  said Poppy. With a small nod of her head, Poppy made her way around the table
  and headed in the direction of the employees&#146; quarters.</P>
<P>"Ray that mouth of yours will get you in so much trouble one day. Will you
  all excuse me?" asked Julia. Taking hold of Tallulah&#146;s stroller, Julia
  followed the path that Poppy had taken. When she got to the last bungalow there
  was no sign of Poppy anywhere outside, but Julia did notice that the back door
  was open. She entered holding the baby when her soft knock went unanswered,
  and found Poppy sitting back in her office chair with her eyes closed and her
  feet propped up on the desk. </P>
<P>"Hold it Lizzy," said Poppy. Hearing someone come in, Poppy put her hand over
  the receiver and looked over at her two visitors. "What can I do for you ladies?"
  Poppy asked without much humor. The hurt look on Julia&#146;s face stopped Poppy
  from making any more hurtful comments. There was something in the way that Rayford
  had handled Julia that she didn&#146;t like, but that was no reason to take
  it out on the small woman. "Why don&#146;t you go and rock the half pint, and
  I&#146;ll be out in a minute. I got labor problems in Florida, and I want to
  see if I can solve them over the phone." Julia slowly nodded her head and headed
  outside. </P>
<P>Julia rocked Tallulah until the little girl went to sleep. She went in and
  put her down on the blanket that was still on the floor from the previous day.
  The day had been torturous until she had seen Poppy walk out to the pool deck.
  The blonde had tried that morning to come and see the object of so many of her
  thoughts, but the bungalow had been empty since the early morning. It was getting
  harder for Julia to stay away, and there was some part of her that craved being
  in the presence of the tall woman. It had nothing to do with their talks or
  Poppy&#146;s history, but it had to do with the intimacy that they seemed to
  share without words or touch. The woman that had delivered the fish that night
  told her to follow her heart, and not fight what was meant to be. </P>
<P>She heard the screen door starting to open and got up from the rocker. Listening
  to the advice of someone she had never seen again, Julia walked up to Poppy
  and fell into her. Julia wanted to be held by this woman, to feel her body pulled
  into the strong one standing in the doorway. It was as if Poppy understood what
  she wanted when Julia felt the arms tighten around her. The feeling was so right
  that Julia didn&#146;t understand the tears streaming down her face. Before
  she could control it, she was crying hysterically as she clung to Poppy feeling
  as if she would die if the tall woman would let her go, or sent her away. </P>
<P>If Poppy was surprised by Julia&#146;s actions she didn&#146;t show it, she
  just gathered the crying woman into her arms and provided the only comfort she
  could. For the first time in two years, Poppy didn&#146;t think about Carly
  or anything else. She just held the woman who had two fists full of her shirt
  and rubbed her back in a soothing motion.</P>
<P>When the crying started to calm, Julia&#146;s hands moved from Poppy&#146;s
  shirt and came to rest behind her neck. Julia pulled down gently trying to get
  Poppy to bend down a little so that she could reach her lips. Poppy stiffened
  at the action, and it was like trying to bend a telephone pole. She only relented
  when the teary green eyes looked up at her and asked, "Please?"</P>
<P>There are times in your life when the universe opens up a small window and
  shows you the possibilities that are out there for you. What you can do with
  your life if you choose the right path, or what you can achieve with the right
  motivation. Poppy had only stood on that precipice three times in her life.
  The first was on a warm night under an oak tree in New Orleans, the first time
  she had kissed Carly. The second was the day she signed a contract to buy an
  old resort in Mexico from an elderly woman. And the third was happening to her
  right now. </P>
<P>Julia&#146;s lips were soft and yielding, her hands felt so right behind her
  neck and her body felt at home in her arms. What made it so wrong, was the fact
  that it felt so right. That&#146;s what made Poppy pull back. Julia was married.
  Married to someone else, and that made her off limits. That closed the window
  on the endless possibilities with this woman, and Poppy felt almost cheated
  at having been shown the glimpse to begin with. <I>You can live your whole life
  happier not knowing some things. Ignorance is truly bliss</I>, thought Poppy
  as she leaned her forehead against Julia&#146;s. </P>
<P>"What&#146;s wrong Poppy? Didn&#146;t you like that?" asked Julia. The neck
  under her hands felt tight with tension, but at least Poppy wasn&#146;t moving
  away from her.</P>
<P>"Yes I liked that very much, and I like you very much, but we can&#146;t do
  this. You belong to someone else Julia, and I won&#146;t go through that again,"
  said Poppy with finality. </P>
<P>"But..," started Julia. She didn&#146;t get to finish her comment because someone
  behind them called Poppy&#146;s name.</P>
<P>"Poppy I hope that you don&#146;t mind, but I asked Miguel where I could find
  you. I&#146;m so glad I finally caught up to you," said the redheaded woman
  standing at the end of the trail.</P>
<P>Julia looked at the woman like she had suddenly emerged from a large shell
  like the birth of Aphrodite. The short skirt and matching bra top hid nothing
  of the flawlessly tanned body. Her red auburn hair was a little past her shoulders,
  and framed a face that had to be one of the most beautiful that Julia had ever
  seen.</P>
<P>"Jillian is that you?" asked Poppy. All that good karma Ginger had talked about
  was suddenly taking the final shuttle off the island. Poppy dropped her hands
  from Julia&#146;s body but took hold of one of the small hands. </P>
<P>"Yes it&#146;s me. It&#146;s been a long time, but I would think that you could
  still come down here and kiss me hello," said Jillian. To press her advantage
  the redhead dropped her final tidbit meant to get the tall woman moving in her
  direction. Poppy couldn&#146;t have changed that much in twelve years where
  her convictions were involved, figured Jillian. "Rayford told me where I could
  find you and his wife, Julia is it?" </P>
<P>"But..," started Julia again, but Poppy had already moved away from her. Whoever
  this woman was, she was now sucking on Poppy&#146;s mouth like it contained
  some life sustaining meal. The only thing that made Julia feel better was that
  both of Poppy&#146;s hands were up in the air like she were getting ready to
  start flapping them. Julia could see that the woman was not about to relinquish
  her hold of Poppy, so she went in to get Tallulah and headed back toward her
  bungalow. She wondered if Poppy would even notice that she had left?</P>
<P>Poppy watched, as Julia and the baby moved further away, not missing the hurt
  look on Julia&#146;s face as she walked away. They needed to talk about what
  had happened between them, before their interruption, but she first had to get
  rid of Jillian. </P>
<P>"You haven&#146;t forgotten how to show a girl a good time I see," said Jillian
  as soon as they ended their kiss. The small redhead was still in Poppy&#146;s
  personal space, running her hands up and down the tall woman&#146;s arms. </P>
<P>"This is the famous Jillian I take it?" asked Carly. She circled the couple
  with a finger pressed against her lips. Jillian was the one woman that Carly
  had given thanks to everyday when she was alive. The short redhead was Poppy&#146;s
  first love, but had taken the easy way out by getting married instead of following
  her heart and staying with the one person that could have brought her happiness.
  So Miss Jillian had ended up in the suburbs with a husband that liked to fish
  more than he liked to make love, and three sons that inherited their father&#146;s
  love of slimy things. Carly loved Jillian for one simple fact, and that was
  that the girl had cut Poppy loose opening her heart to the possibility of loving
  someone else. That someone else, thought Carly happily, had ended up on a tropical
  island with a spouse that couldn&#146;t keep her hands off of her, and a fairly
  tale life. </P>
<P>"I give her extra points for waiting this long to track you down, and where
  does this girl shop?" asked Carly. She stood behind Jillian facing Poppy. They
  both laughed at the situation. </P>
<P>"Yes baby, I&#146;m happy to see you too. I knew that you would be thrilled
  to see me," said an oblivious Jillian.</P>
<P>"Why don&#146;t you have a seat Jillian and I&#146;ll get us something to drink,"
  offered Poppy. She pried the woman off the front of her body and headed back
  toward her porch. Jillian followed and sat in the chaise lounge to one side.
  "What would you like?" asked Poppy. "Whatever you&#146;re having Poppy."</P>
<P>"This is too much. She&#146;s here to comfort the poor lonely widow that&#146;s
  worth more than her whole family combined, going back to caveman days. You are
  not seriously considering entertaining this woman&#146;s delusions are you?"
  asked Carly. Poppy was ignoring Carly for the moment, as the dead woman ranted
  in the middle of the kitchen as Poppy pulled two beers out of the refrigerator.
  "Poppy she is here because you have money, not because she is trying to rekindle
  the flame, that might I point out she put out, you once shared."</P>
<P>"Calm down Carly, I know what I&#146;m doing. I&#146;m young but not totally
  brain dead," Poppy told her. It was one of their oldest arguments. Poppy had
  savvy, but Carly always had her beat on life&#146;s experience.</P>
<P>"Calm? There is a viper sitting out there on your porch looking like an open
  buffet, and you expect me to stay calm?" asked Carly.</P>
<P>Poppy thought that Carly had gone back into the great beyond when she walked
  back outside alone. Alone with Jillian, until Carly just walked through the
  wall behind the reclining woman and sat on the railing next to her.</P>
<P>"Still boring when it comes to picking out drinks I see Poppy," commented Jillian,
  as she reached up for the green bottle. She had had enough beer to last a lifetime
  after marrying Philip. </P>
<P>"What did you expect, champagne cocktails?" asked an amused Poppy. She plopped
  down on the rocker and waited for an answer. The brow over her left eye arched
  in question, not for the breathing woman but for the transparent one seated
  on the railing.</P>
<P>"I loved that you never changed much of your true self once you made it honey.
  It was one of the things I always found most attractive about you. The memories
  of you that I will treasure most is that you never seemed embarrassed by showing
  your pleasure in something. It didn&#146;t matter if it was seeing something
  for the first time, or trying something new. I never had that growing up, everyone
  always tried to act so cool about everything it stifled my own enthusiasm for
  things. You gave that back to me," said Carly. Carly looked at Poppy and smiled.
  Only when the responding smile came back at her did she realize her mistake.
  The bitch in heat on the chaise thought that the smile, and the eyes filled
  with love were for her.</P>
<P>Ginger and Matlin saw Julia in a rush to get back to her bungalow. The young
  woman was coming from the direction of Poppy&#146;s bungalow, and that caused
  them some concern. Looking at each other they veered off of their original destination,
  which was to see Poppy, and headed toward the young woman&#146;s home.</P>
<P>"What do you suppose Poppy did to her?" asked Ginger. "Don&#146;t go jumping
  to conclusions there Madame Butterfly, this could just be a case of hormones,"
  commented Matlin, even though she had a feeling she knew what this was about.
  <I>You big lug, if you hurt that sweet girl&#146;s feelings, I will personally
  knock some sense into you</I>, thought Matlin. She was one of the only people
  who knew why Julian was on the island, and promised both Rayford and Julia that
  she would keep quiet about it.</P>
<P>Julia came to the door when she heard Matlin calling out to her. At the sight
  of Matlin&#146;s concerned face, Julia started crying again. Between sobs she
  told the two older women what had happened, and about the arrival of Jillian.
  "I&#146;m afraid that I&#146;ve messed things up now, and I&#146;m going to
  have to leave. She didn&#146;t seemed to thrilled with the fact that both of
  us kissed her," said Julia. She wiped away her tears again and looked at the
  two sympathetic faces looking back at her. </P>
<P>"First off, no one is going anywhere, so put that thought right out of your
  head young lady. Matlin and I are going to do our best to tell you a story,
  and you and Tallulah are going to do your best and sit there and listen to what
  we have to say. Julia, when two people meet and fall in love, that usually changes
  their lives for the better. In this story that holds true, but it also changed
  so many other lives, that it didn&#146;t make for the smoothest of rides. Not
  to say that that wouldn&#146;t have happened anyway, but by a chance meeting,
  it sped things along. This is the story of Poppy and Carly, the way we saw it
  and lived it," explained Ginger. She began her story in that bar they had found
  Poppy in and went on from there. They took turns telling Julia about the two
  women that had shaped this island, and their lives around one another. They
  were about halfway finished when they stopped and ordered dinner.</P>
<P>"She lost so much when she lost Carly, didn&#146;t she?" asked Julia. She bit
  into the egg roll in her hand and closed her eyes in ecstasy. The strange woman
  she had met when she had delivered their cleaned fish had personally delivered
  a meal that they had not ordered. Picking from the menus of the different restaurants
  they had ordered a variety of items, but Julia had had a craving for Chinese
  food. Unfortunately for her it had not been one of the choices to pick from.
  Marta had laughed at Julia&#146;s expression when she lifted the lids on the
  dishes and saw all her favorites sitting there. Julia found the laugh, as well
  as the food, a great comfort. This woman dressed in white had a way of making
  her feel like everything would be all right, if you had enough faith. <I>For
  an old Spanish woman with a heavy accent she sure can make a mean egg roll</I>,
  thought Julia.</P>
<P>"She did, and she didn&#146;t," said Matlin. She scooped some more fried rice
  into her plate and thought of the best way to explain her comment. "Poppy learned
  things from Carly, things that will make her next mate very happy." The laughter
  from the other two women stopped Matlin from saying anything else. "Not that,
  you two heathens. What I mean is, that Poppy has been properly trained in how
  to conduct and participate in a healthy relationship. Carly always joked that
  when she was done training Poppy, making her perfect, some young thing to come
  in and swoop her away from her. Before she died, she made Ginger and I promise
  that we would do our level best that that would happen. She wanted Poppy to
  go out and find someone new and exciting to share her life. People look at Poppy
  to solve all these problems with the company she founded, but I bet they forget
  that she is just on the other side of thirty. She still got a lot of living
  to do before she dies, and Carly wanted her to take advantage of that."</P>
<P>"Yeah, she told us they would work out the logistics of time sharing once they
  all got to the afterlife. What we are trying to tell you Julia is that we don&#146;t
  think Poppy rejected you because of the fact she isn&#146;t attracted to you,
  she did it because she is scared. Get some more of that Imperial Chicken and
  I&#146;ll explain," said Ginger. "Poppy got all of Carly. She got her love,
  her family and the problems that came along with that. When it was all said
  and done, they went on to be happy, but Thomas did not go away quietly. If Poppy
  thinks that you are married there is no way in hell she&#146;s going to come
  anywhere near you, even if she thinks you might be the holy grail. I remember
  this one Mardi Gras season when they had just come back from Mexico, and were
  invited to one of the more exclusive balls."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The room was crowed with the power brokers of New Orleans. To be there meant
  that you had made it into the enter sanctum of New Orleans society. This was
  not one of the large balls that you could buy tickets to, this was by invitation
  only. An invitation that was delivered to your door by a butler carrying a silver
  tray, on which rested a linen paper handwritten addressed envelope and a blood
  red rose. If you accepted then you agreed to mask until midnight, there were
  no exceptions. That was the only costume required, besides ball gowns for the
  ladies, and tails for their escorts.</P>
<P>What surprised Poppy the most, beside the fact there had been an older distinguished
  looking gentleman on their door with a tray in his hand, was that the invitation
  had come addressed to her and not Carly. Carly was there with her that evening,
  not the other way around. Her wife had explained on the way over to the large
  uptown mansion that Poppy was considered to be the head of their family. Carly&#146;s
  name change had signaled the hostess as to who should get the invitation. </P>
<P>Poppy watched as the slim figure, which had been poured into the black sheath
  gown she was wearing, walked across the empty dance floor toward her. A quick
  scan of the room told her that she wasn&#146;t the only one watching. The woman
  stopped two feet from her, and made a slow perusal of the body in front of her.
  Poppy could see the green eyes behind the black plumed mask, which matched her
  own, rake up and down her body. Some of the conversations around them had come
  to a conspicuous halt as the spectators looked on to see how this tableau was
  going to play out. This couple was new and they had speculated as to who they
  might be. The woman in the devastating sexy black dress had come in on the arm
  of the person in front of her. The only features they could make out of him,
  or her, was the short ponytail tied with black silk ribbon, and the blue eyes
  behind the mask. Carly had picked Poppy&#146;s tuxedo with tails as was expected,
  but had outfitted it with an old fashioned shirt. The kind that had a high collar
  with a tie that was wider and softer than the customary black worn by everyone
  else. The look made Poppy seem taller, and more distinguished than everyone
  else in the room.</P>
<P>"Would it be rude to ask you to dance?" asked Poppy. They had been there an
  hour and no one had made a move toward the dance floor yet. By the change in
  her eyes, Poppy could tell that Carly was smiling.</P>
<P>"I just spoke to Emily and she asked if we would get the ball rolling, so to
  speak. How about we try out some of those dance lessons we took?" asked Carly.
  With a short nod, Poppy moved away from her and headed toward the bandstand
  to speak with the conductor. Carly watched as the long fingers reached into
  the front pant pocket, and removed the money clip that she had given the young
  woman as a Christmas present. The clip had a poppy flower engraved on the front,
  and Love C engraved on the back. Poppy shook the man&#146;s hand giving him
  the money in her hand, and moved back toward Carly.</P>
<P>When she heard the passionate guitar opening, Carly threw her head back and
  laughed at Poppy&#146;s choice. Emily would probably remove them from the guest
  list after this, but it didn&#146;t matter to Carly now. Now she concentrated
  on the strong tall body behind her and looked for Thomas in the crowd. <I>This
  should blow his little mind right out of the ballpark</I>, thought Carly.</P>
<P>The hands around her waist tightened and Poppy turned her abruptly around when
  the rest of the band joined the lone guitar in the playing of the Tango. The
  world fell away as Carly molded her body to Poppy&#146;s and moved with her
  around the dance floor to the sensuous dance. The Spanish were passionate people,
  and it showed in the dances they had learned together, but this one was like
  making love on the dance floor. Poppy guided her through the steps, as all the
  while, she whispered in Carly&#146;s ear. On the last note, Carly&#146;s chest
  was heaving, not from the dancing, but from the soft love words Poppy had told
  her as they danced. </P>
<P>Emily St. Claire stepped onto the dance floor and moved toward the couple with
  slow deliberate steps. Emily was in her early sixties, and married to Myron
  St. Claire, the president and CEO of New Orleans&#146; oldest and biggest banking
  chains. This party had become a bit of a chore instead of fun in the past few
  years. It took a tremendous amount of effort and work to ready the third floor
  ballroom of their large home to host this event every year, but Myron loved
  it and Emily capitulated. Carly and Poppy managed to put some sparkle back into
  the evening with a short three-minute dance. As Emily neared them, she took
  in the tall figure of Poppy Valente, and her hands, one of which was intertwined
  with Carly&#146;s. <I>Carly sugar, I hope this one doesn&#146;t kill you one
  night from pure pleasure,</I> thought Emily when she stopped. In an instant,
  Myron was standing next to his wife as she readied herself to pass judgement.</P>
<P>"Carly would you do an old woman and an old friend a favor?" asked Emily. Carly
  nodded her head and smiled behind all the plumes covering her face. The tone
  of Emily&#146;s voice told Carly, she would like whatever was about to be asked
  by the hostess.</P>
<P>"Lend me your spouse here for the next dance. I promise to return her in the
  same condition in which I found her," said Emily to Carly. Addressing Poppy
  she continued, "Only, would you consider a waltz? I don&#146;t think I could
  contort my body like Carly can. And if I hadn&#146;t had the opportunity, let
  me give you our congratulations now. Myron and I are thrilled for you both,"
  said Emily softly. She wanted to be heard by only the couple in front of them
  and no one else. Her peripheral vision told her that most of the other guests
  were about to fall over onto the dance floor trying to hear their conversation.</P>
<P>"Thank you Emily. Poppy and I got your lovely card and bottle of champagne
  on our honeymoon. I&#146;ll lend you Poppy, if I can have the next dance with
  Myron?" offered Carly.</P>
<P>"Please dear be my guest, only watch those big feet of his. They can be lethal."</P>
<P>Millicent Voncleef, the social reporter for the paper, sat in the back of the
  room and took notes. When the masks came off she would have her lead story for
  the Sunday edition. Whoever the young buck was twirling Emily around the dance
  floor, would be Millicent&#146;s quest for the evening. She vowed to get the
  whole story before the night was through. </P>
<P>When the music started again everyone joined into the merriment, and hit the
  dance floor. Poppy and Carly enjoyed themselves into the evening, and were on
  the dance floor as the clock reached the witching hour. Poppy was singing softly
  along with the band as she held Carly, when the time came to remove their masks.
  The lights were dimmed and with one quick tug from Carly, Poppy&#146;s mask
  fell away. Carly had missed looking at Poppy&#146;s face all evening and was
  grateful when Poppy returned the favor and relieved her of her own mask. Their
  moment was shattered when Thomas barged up and grabbed Carly by the arm intending
  to tell her what an embarrassment she was. He didn&#146;t get his chance when
  a large hand closed around his throat with a vice grip and lifted. </P>
<P>The crowd parted as Poppy walked past them with Thomas attached to the end
  of her arm, walking on his toes and pawing futilely at her grip. There was a
  fleeting moment of worry in Carly&#146;s mind for Thomas, as she followed them
  out to one of the balconies. The calm, low voice that Poppy was using told Carly
  just how mad she was. Her lover had a way of becoming more controlled in her
  actions, the more out of control her emotions got.</P>
<P>"Listen to me you asshole. You see that woman there?" asked Poppy. She swung
  him around to look a Carly. "Do you?" she asked again. There was a slight nod
  from Thomas as his face got a darker shade of red. "You are never to lay a hand
  on her again unless she invites you to do so. If you insist on manhandling her,
  then I will beat you until your mother won&#146;t recognize you. You might not
  have respected her when <B>you</B> were married, but you will respect her now
  that she is married to <B>me</B>. Understand?" asked Poppy. She let him go and
  turned to Carly to see if the woman was all right. </P>
<P>"Hold me?" asked Carly. </P>
<P>"Always."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"He never messed with them much after that, not to their faces anyway. Thomas
  is still trying, I think, to ruin their standing in the community but it was
  all for nothing. I mean catch a clue, Carly died, but he is still bitter. The
  next day had it been any other hostess but Emily St. Claire, they might have
  been mighty pissed with Millicent&#146;s article. It was a lengthy article about
  Poppy and Carly, and the love they shared. The only picture included with the
  story, was the one of Poppy holding Carly on the balcony. Emily had it framed
  and gave it to them as a belated wedding present. Thomas and Rita never found
  the St. Claire butler darkening their door again, and were dropped from a number
  of other social events as well. Thomas was downright spiteful after that," explained
  Ginger.</P>
<P>"That was just one of the things he pulled during that time Julia. During the
  divorce it was just horrible, so you see Poppy&#146;s reluctance to go through
  that again," continued Matlin. </P>
<P>"But I&#146;m not married Matlin, and you know how Tallulah came along, so
  I don&#146;t see a problem. My life and how I live it, is only a problem for
  my parents. I&#146;m perfectly content with who I am, as are the people that
  are the most important to me. Rayford and Granny have been great through all
  of this," explained Julia. For once in her life, she felt connected to someone
  even after a couple of days in their presence. She couldn&#146;t explain it
  but she wanted to be with Poppy, and get closer to her. The time that they had
  together already, had been perfect, and not strained like most first dates were.</P>
<P>"We realize that honey, we just have to get the hardhead next door to realize
  that as well. It would make me and Ginger happy to see you happy, as well as
  fulfill a promise to a dear friend," said Matlin. She looked at the exhausted
  young woman and decided that it was time to intervene. Julia, like Poppy, had
  had a rough life up to now, and maybe they could change that for the better
  for each other. </P>
<P>"Would you like to go out to dinner?" asked Jillian. Poppy had sat across from
  her all evening, and answered all her questions in a formal manner. No amount
  of seductive poses on Jillian&#146;s part was getting the singer to move from
  the rocker. She had told Poppy about her divorce, hoping that it would prompt
  Poppy into action but it hadn&#146;t so far.</P>
<P>"No thank you Jillian. If you don&#146;t mind I&#146;m going to call it a night,
  it&#146;s been a hectic day. Thanks for stopping by, and I&#146;m sure there
  will be time for us to get together before it&#146;s time for you to leave.
  Would you like for me to call for a cart to escort you back to your bungalow?"
  asked Poppy. Three and a half hours of listening to her old girlfriend&#146;s
  complaints about her life was her limit. For the most part she carried on a
  private conversation in her head with Carly, only grunting and nodding her head
  in the appropriate places with cues from Carly.</P>
<P>"No that&#146;s ok, I can find my way back. I was just hoping that we could
  spend some quality time together while I was here, and I can stay as long as
  you want me to. With Philip getting custody of the children, I don&#146;t have
  anyone waiting at home for me." Jillian got up and stretched, putting her body
  on display for Poppy.</P>
<P>"But if you want me to, I&#146;ll strip right here, right now, and give you
  a lap dance," chimed Carly from the banister she was seated on. Poppy laughed
  at the sarcastic remark as she walked Jillian down the steps. She moved quickly
  back to the porch to avoid any more amorous advances from the new divorcee.
</P>
<P>The next morning Julia left the just fed Tallulah in Rayford&#146;s care, and
  set out toward Poppy&#146;s bungalow. They needed to talk about what had happened
  between them the day before, and about any future they might have. It was time
  to set the record straight with the tall woman and there was no time like the
  present. When she made her way to the back hoping to find Poppy having her first
  cup of coffee in the rocker, Julia was surprised to find Jillian instead. Wrapped
  in what she assumed to be only a robe, the woman looked like she had just gotten
  up from spending the night with Poppy. The thought of this woman sharing Poppy&#146;s
  bed, made her feel sick. Julia turned around and made her way back to her baby.
  Her only thoughts were to get off the island, and as soon as possible.</P>
<P>"Thank you Miguel, you&#146;re a life saver. I&#146;ll be at the helipad in
  an hour. No whatever flight you can get me this afternoon is fine. It&#146;ll
  be me and the baby," said Julia. She didn&#146;t turn around when she heard
  the door open and close not caring who it was. </P>
<P>"Where are you going Jules?" asked Rayford. He could tell that she had been
  crying and couldn&#146;t understand why.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m going home Ray. Even if it is going to be hell, I&#146;m going back,
  because I can&#146;t stay here any longer," said Julia as she fell against his
  chest crying again. It hurt so much that Poppy had picked that woman over her.
</P>
<P>"What happened Jules? I thought you were going to stick out with me for a while
  until you decided what you wanted to do?" asked Ray.</P>
<P>"Well there is some stuff that I didn&#146;t plan on Ray, and because of that,
  I have got to get out of here. Will you help me pack up and get the baby ready?"</P>
<P>It seemed like she had just asked him the question when Rayford found himself
  standing next to the helipad waving Julia goodbye. He had gotten part of the
  story out of her while he helped her put her belongings back into the luggage
  that had brought them there, and now that she was airborne he went in search
  of the object of Julia&#146;s hurt.</P>
<P>"Miguel who is landing today?" asked Poppy over a cup of coffee. She and the
  manager had been going over the problems encountered by the staff after their
  first day with real guests.</P>
<P>"No one is landing Poppy, someone is leaving. Or should I say, two people are
  leaving," said Miguel in a miffed voice. He knew something had happened between
  his boss and Julia to make the sweet woman want to leave. The shocked look on
  her face confused him, and Miguel waited to see what she would say.</P>
<P>"YOU! What did you do to Julia, you big ape?" screamed Rayford. He didn&#146;t
  care that there were guests milling around them, he wanted answers. </P>
<P>"I didn&#146;t do.." Poppy started but didn&#146;t finish due to the fist connecting
  with her nose. It happened so fast that she didn&#146;t have time to defend
  herself from Rayford&#146;s attack. The force of his blow threw her back and
  into the pool filling the water around her with blood. When she resurfaced,
  Rayford looked suddenly unsure of his actions when he saw the rage in Poppy&#146;s
  eyes. No sooner than her hands had hit the pool deck, Poppy was on him like
  fury. She grabbed his collar and cocked her fist back to retaliate, but hesitated
  before hitting him. There was something about the guy that she found familiar.</P>
<P>"I didn&#146;t do anything to her, asshole. If you were home more often instead
  of flirting with the front desk workers, maybe your wife wouldn&#146;t have
  flown out today," said Poppy. Her fist was about to return the favor of a broken
  nose, when Poppy heard Rayford, Ginger and Matlin all break out into laughter.
</P>
<P>"What&#146;s so damn funny?" demanded Poppy.</P>
<P>"She&#146;s not his wife, you idiot, she&#146;s his twin sister," said Matlin.
  It was his eyes that she found so familiar, decided Poppy as she let Rayford
  go. </P>
<P>"She&#146;s your sister? But she had a wedding ring on," said Poppy. When she
  dropped back into her chair was when she noticed the blood streaming down her
  face. But the pain of her nose was no competition for the pain in her heart.
  Julia had left without saying goodbye, which only meant that she didn&#146;t
  want a future with her.</P>
<P>"The rings belong to our grandmother. She didn&#146;t want people looking down
  on Julia because she wasn&#146;t married," said Rayford. The people sitting
  next to them were straining to hear what the altercation was about.</P>
<P>"It&#146;s going to need surgery to set it properly Ms. Valente," said the
  nurse on the island&#146;s infirmary. She had put two stitches in the cut over
  the bridge, but didn&#146;t want to attempt straightening Poppy&#146;s nose,
  less she do more damage. The bruise was starting to set in and Poppy&#146;s
  nodding head made her resemble an agreeable raccoon.</P>
<P>"You are going after her aren&#146;t you?" asked Matlin from the chair in the
  corner of the room. Her concern over Poppy&#146;s dazed look was starting to
  grow. Ever since Rayford had slugged her, Poppy had been acting strangely. </P>
<P>"Considering that she left the island Matlin, should tell you that she doesn&#146;t
  want anything to do with me," said Poppy. In that instant, it was like she woke
  up from a three-day stupor and figured out Julia was really gone. Poppy jumped
  off the table with the intention of going home, when the blackness set in. When
  her feet hit the ground they were followed by the rest of her as she fell forward.</P>
<P>"Nurse, get back in here," yelled Matlin. </P>
<P>The feeling of someone running their fingers through her hair woke Poppy up.
  Focusing on her surroundings she could see that she was in a hospital room in
  Venezuela. Both Matlin and Ginger were asleep on the small sofa across from
  the bed snoring softly against each other. Carly was the only one awake and
  keeping vigil over Poppy, and the sight of her sitting on the bed made Poppy
  smile.</P>
<P>"Look at you my love. You are quite the sight," Carly said softly. The bruise
  from the broken nose had only darkened with time, leaving Poppy with two perfect
  black eyes, and the fall had left her with a broken right wrist. </P>
<P>"Tell me that I didn&#146;t have surgery on my nose here?" whispered Poppy.
</P>
<P>"No, you&#146;ll have that when we get you home honey, so stop worrying. Would
  I let anything happen to this face?" asked Carly. She squeezed Poppy&#146;s
  cheeks together for emphasis and laughed at the picture Poppy made. </P>
<P>"Since we have time, let&#146;s plan your next step honey. Cause let me tell
  you, you haven&#146;t done so well on your own this time around. That girl loves
  you, and you let her get away. You know you are suppose to get better with age,
  not the other way around," chided Carly.</P>
<P>"Please baby, I would rather not discuss my love life with my dead wife, if
  it&#146;s all the same to you. I just don&#146;t understand why she left?" Poppy
  mused out loud.</P>
<P>"She left, rock head, because of that barracuda ex-girlfriend of yours. Julia
  is important to your future honey, so don&#146;t screw this up. Now let&#146;s
  get a move on."</P>
<P>Poppy looked for the clothes she had been wearing when she left the island
  but couldn&#146;t locate them anywhere in the room. Moving slowly around the
  two sleeping women on the sofa, she found one of their cell phones and started
  making calls.</P>
<P>"Bob this is your commander speaking," Poppy whispered into the phone. She
  waited for the question he was going to ask, and hoped that her foggy mind could
  remember the codeword. </P>
<P>"This is eagle one sir, what&#146;s the mission codeword and what&#146;s your
  position?" asked the pilot.</P>
<P>"The codeword is gypsy lady, and my position is Venezuela. Now get your ass
  over here and pick me up. I&#146;m being held captive at the hospital, so make
  it snappy. While you are en route, call in a flight plan for the states. Our
  destination is Houston, Texas. Got all that soldier?" asked Poppy. She was crammed
  into the small closet so that she wouldn&#146;t wake Ginger and Matlin.</P>
<P>"Aye aye sir, I&#146;ll be there in twenty minutes. Should I come armed, sir?"
  asked Bob.</P>
<P>"No! I&#146;ll be out front in the bushes waiting for you. Don&#146;t shoot
  anyone, do you copy?" asked Poppy.</P>
<P>"Yes sir," yelled Bob before hanging up. He started a fast jog toward Poppy&#146;s
  plane that had been parked at the Aruba airport since her arrival. Bob had been
  enjoying some R&amp;R while his boss was on her secret mission on one of the
  islands.</P>
<P>"Crazy son of a bitch," Poppy muttered into the phone as she waited for her
  next call to go through. "Miguel where is she? I know you know, and I know that
  you are going to tell me."</P>
<P>"I can&#146;t tell you that Poppy, she made me promise. Miss Julia is a sweet
  girl and she was very hurt when she left," said Miguel. </P>
<P>"Miguel I have a broken nose because of that Neanderthal brother of hers, and
  my wrist is now broken. Do you for one minute think that I am in a good mood?
  Because let me tell you, my little Mexican friend, I&#146;m dying to hit someone
  with my good hand and I would hate for it to be you," Poppy whispered menacingly
  from the closet. </P>
<P>"I&#146;m not afraid of you Poppy Valente, so stop threatening me, and I&#146;m
  not going to tell you where she is so there," said Miguel with more bravado
  then he felt. The dial tone on the end the line worried him more than the threat
  of a beating. He had no doubt that she could do it, but Poppy was all bluster
  and no action when it came to her friends. A hang up though, meant that she
  was mad with the outcome of the conversation, and that took a little more doing
  to get over. </P>
<P>The security guard at the front desk of the hospital rubbed his eyes when he
  saw a tall woman running across the front lawn toward a waiting jeep wearing
  a hospital gown. It was open in the back showing off a lovely backside so he
  figured he must have been hallucinating. An airport worker had the same hallucination
  when he saw the same tall figure getting into a private plane parked on the
  tarmac. </P>
<P>"Lizzy get all the information on a Julia Johnson you can find. And before
  you ask, don&#146;t. Just get it and call me on the plane. I&#146;m on my way
  back to the states."</P>
<P>"Ok, can I ask why you sound so funny?" asked Elizabeth. From her office in
  New Orleans, Elizabeth pulled a white pad out of her desk drawer and readied
  herself to take notes.</P>
<P>"Rayford Johnson punched me in the face and broke my nose," answered Poppy.
  Her explanation sounded so nonchalant that Elizabeth almost missed what had
  happened.</P>
<P>"Why that little. Wait till I get a hold of Matlin for hiring the little creep.
  You fired him didn&#146;t you? And please tell me that he is at least hospitalized
  after you got through with him?" asked Elizabeth. The answer Poppy had given
  her had made Elizabeth jump out of her chair in anger.</P>
<P>"Nope, he&#146;s fine and still at work. It&#146;s a long story Lizzy that
  I&#146;ll tell you when I see you. For now start working on that information
  and I&#146;ll call you when we touch down," said Poppy from the sofa of the
  plane. She was lying down trying to get the throbbing in her head and arm to
  go away.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Julia honey, you really should eat something. It&#146;s not good for the baby,
  or for you," said Julia&#146;s grandmother Tallulah. The kind old woman had
  a sandwich and a glass of milk on the tray she carried into Julia&#146;s old
  room. Granny, as the two Johnson children so fondly called her, had taken care
  of the twins from the time of their birth. Her son, Fredrick, and daughter in
  law, Janice, had traveled so much and had lived out of the country so much with
  Fred&#146;s job, that his mother had volunteered to keep them. They had brought
  Tallulah so much pleasure over the years, that she had come to think of them
  as her own.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m just not hungry granny," said Julia. She was sitting in the box seat
  under the window looking out into the night. During the day, the window looked
  out on the green pastures that surrounded her grandmother&#146;s home. In Texas
  you were either in the oil &#145;bidness&#146; or the cattle &#145;bidness&#146;,
  and her grandfather Fred had been a cattle rancher. </P>
<P>"Well, why don&#146;t you try and take a few bites, and when your mouth&#146;s
  not full you can tell me what&#146;s bothering you, and what&#146;s brought
  you back here. Not that I mind having you and that beautiful little girl here
  with me. It&#146;s been quite lonely here since you and that grandson of mine
  went off to college," said Tallulah. She set the tray down by Julia&#146;s legs
  and took a seat across from her on the bed. With her hands folded on her lap,
  Tallulah waited for an answer.</P>
<P>Julia ate half the sandwich as a delay tactic in beginning her talk with her
  grandmother. She looked out the window so that she wouldn&#146;t have to make
  eye contact with the one person whose opinion meant the most to her. "I met
  someone granny," started Julia.</P>
<P>"Oh Julia, that&#146;s wonderful. I&#146;ve always dreamed of you finding your
  Prince Fredrick out there. I want you to have the same love in your life that
  your grandfather and I had. You never got to know him, but your grandfather
  was such a romantic fella. There were always flowers or something that he would
  think to get me so that I wouldn&#146;t forget who his favorite girl was," reminisced
  Tallulah.</P>
<P>"Trust me granny, I&#146;ve been wined and dined plenty in the past two months.
  Not to mention sailed, and serenaded as well." Julia thought back to the bug
  song Poppy was always singing to the baby, and a smile broke out across her
  face. Just as quickly she thought of Poppy in bed with Jillian, and the pain
  in her heart was evident even to her grandmother. </P>
<P>"What&#146;s his name honey?" asked Tallulah. She was beginning to see what
  the problem was, and hoped whoever this idiot was, hadn&#146;t used the young
  woman as a quick fling on his vacation.</P>
<P>"Poppy."</P>
<P>"That&#146;s an odd name. Sounds like some kind of cartoon character. If this
  guy is so wonderful and you love him sweetheart, then why are you not with him?"</P>
<P>"She&#146;s real all right, granny, and I&#146;m not with her because I saw
  something that makes me think she doesn&#146;t feel the same way about me,"
  said Julia. The blonde head bowed and waited for the outburst that would certainly
  come from the bed. Her grandmother had never judged her, but Julia had never
  told her that she was gay.</P>
<P>"I see. What did Poppy do that makes you think she doesn&#146;t feel the same
  way about you?" asked Tallulah in a calm, sincere voice. The old woman laughed
  when the blonde head whipped up and green eyes focused on her because of her
  question. Julia&#146;s eyes had misted over at her grandmother&#146;s approval.</P>
<P>For the next hour Julia told the story of her and Poppy. From their first meeting
  in the coffee shop in New Orleans, to the singer&#146;s sleeping with Jillian.
  When she was done, Julia fell into the arms that had soothed away her childhood
  fears, and cried over the pain in her heart.</P>
<P>"Did you talk to her about this sweetheart? Maybe you are jumping to some big
  conclusions here, and she does think that you are married to that ornery brother
  of yours. Though, God help the woman that finally gets that job," teased Tallulah.
  Julia laughed along with her grandmother as she thought of her brother&#146;s
  romantic history.</P>
<P>"No, I just left before she would feel like I was in the way. Poppy doesn&#146;t
  even know I&#146;m gone," said Julia. She hugged her grandmother one more time
  before sitting up and reaching for her daughter. "Let me get the little princess
  changed and ready for bed. Mother invited me for lunch at the club tomorrow
  when she called earlier. I&#146;m not looking forward to another lecture about
  how I&#146;ve screwed up my life by having a child out of wedlock, but I might
  as well try to mend fences since I&#146;m home for now. That is if you don&#146;t
  mind me and Tallulah Jr. here staying with you granny." </P>
<P>"You and your little one can stay as long as you like. Maybe together we can
  come up with a solution to your Poppy problem. She must be pretty thick headed
  if she passes up the opportunity to get you two beauties tied up in one neat
  package." Tallulah kissed both of them on the cheek then headed downstairs to
  turn in for the night.</P>
<P>"Thanks granny."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Good evening Ms. Valente. Do you have any luggage on board that I can help
  you with?" asked the clerk from the rent a car agency. There was a familiar
  looking bag sitting at his feet, and Poppy knew that Elizabeth was responsible.
  The closet in the plane had some of her clothing, but not a lot. The hospital
  gown had been replaced with jeans and a t-shirt since they were the easiest
  things to put on with her hand being incapacitated. </P>
<P>"Just the briefcase and laptop case if you would. Thanks for meeting me, and
  I presume that the bag you have there belongs to me?" asked Poppy. She descended
  the steps of the plane and walked to the sports utility vehicle that stood waiting
  for her.</P>
<P>"Yes ma&#146;am, I&#146;ll put them all in the back, and the keys are in the
  ignition. Ms. Stevens wanted me to let you know you and Bob each have rooms
  waiting at the Hyatt under your name, and the information you wanted is waiting
  at the front desk.</P>
<P>"Thanks, do you have another car for Bob?" asked Poppy.</P>
<P>"All taken care of Ms. Valente," said the clerk as he disappeared through the
  door of the plane to get the rest of her stuff.</P>
<P>"Bob I&#146;ll give you a call when I&#146;m ready to go. Until then, have
  a good time, and call me if you need anything." Poppy jumped into the Ford Expedition
  and drove off to the hotel. She had figured out on the trip there where Julia
  probably ended up after her return to the states. Now, Poppy just had to find
  where the elder Tallulah lived, then see if she could straighten things out
  with her granddaughter.</P>
<P>The next morning, Poppy headed out of town following the map the front desk
  clerk had made for her. The vast empty spaces that she was traveling through
  were new terrain for her. It gave the place a lonely feel to it. As she listened
  to the Charlie Daniels Band telling the story of the devil fiddling in Georgia
  on the radio, Poppy wondered what it would have been like to grow up here.</P>
<P>After an hour and forty minutes, a large gate on the right broke the monotonous
  scenery she had been driving through. The iron structure had a large E on the
  top that was pierced by long cattle horns. On a smaller plaque at eye level
  from the car was the name Esperanza Ranch. "Let&#146;s wish that the name bodes
  well for my visit. Everyone needs a little hope," said Poppy to a cow that was
  grazing near the front fence.</P>
<P>The house didn&#146;t come into view until three miles down the dirt drive.
  Its white wood and black shutters reminded Poppy of the house on the show Dallas.
  While not as big as that one, it was still a decent size porch running along
  the length of the front. Someone had taken their time with the gardens in front,
  since they were brimming with flowers and healthy looking trees even in the
  unbearable heat. Before Poppy&#146;s first foot hit the ground out of the car,
  a slight looking woman came out of the front door. She shielded her eyes from
  the glare as she looked toward her visitor.</P>
<P>"Excuse me, I&#146;m looking for Julia Johnson," said Poppy. She closed the
  car door with her good hand and stepped forward to introduce herself.</P>
<P>"Come on up here Poppy, and have a seat," ordered the old lady as she went
  back into the house. A few minutes later she walked back out with two cups of
  coffee and a coffee cake she had baked that morning. She looked at the woman
  still standing in her front yard and laughed at the shocked expression on her
  face. "Well come on, I don&#146;t bite."</P>
<P>"How did you know my name?" asked Poppy as she stepped forward.</P>
<P>"My granddaughter did a fairly good job at describing you. I bet if you took
  off those fancy sunglasses, there would be some pretty blue eyes waiting there
  for me. Now come talk to an old woman and tell me what you want."</P>
<P>"I came to see Julia and Tallulah. They left without saying good-bye, and I
  have a feeling I know why. I&#146;m here because, I want her to understand how
  I feel."</P>
<P>"How do you feel Poppy? I want you to be sure of your intentions. Julia is
  important to me, and I love her more than life itself. I don&#146;t want her
  hurt," said Tallulah. She leaned forward and patted Poppy&#146;s knee.</P>
<P>"I want to spend time with Julia and her daughter. The past two months of my
  life have brought me more joy, than the last two years. Julia is important to
  me too ma&#146;am, and I want the opportunity to build on that. I&#146;m not
  out to hurt her," said Poppy. She took the hand on her knee and squeezed it.
  "Can I see her?" </P>
<P>"She&#146;s not here Poppy," said Tallulah. The slump in the broad shoulders
  told her that Poppy was disappointed. Julia&#146;s grandmother was about to
  explain, when a familiar cry broke the quite around them. When Poppy looked
  at her suspiciously, Tallulah defended herself. "I didn&#146;t say the little
  one wasn&#146;t here, I just said her mother&#146;s not here. She went in to
  town to have lunch with her mother."</P>
<P>"May I?" asked Poppy. She was up and moving into the house as soon as Tallulah
  nodded her head. It wasn&#146;t time for the little girl to eat again, so her
  grandmother figured she was just crying for attention, or her stomach hurt.
  She was interested in how this tall imposing figure handled Julia&#146;s daughter.
</P>
<P>The screen door creaked again as Poppy stepped out with a now quite baby. She
  sat on the porch swing and started singing to the little girl. The baby&#146;s
  great grandmother had never heard the gentle song and didn&#146;t understand
  all the words since Poppy was singing in Spanish, but she saw the face of the
  singer soften when she looked down at her charge. It was a touching sight when
  the baby reached up and put her little hand on Poppy&#146;s cheek like it was
  something she did everyday. <I>She loves one without even knowing it, let&#146;s
  see if we can get her to see that about the mother too,</I> thought Tallulah
  as she watched. </P>
<P>Poppy held Tallulah close to her and inhaled the sweet innocent smell that
  always clung to the baby. It had only been a day, but she had missed seeing
  the little person that had become a part of her life. When she looked up, Poppy
  could see the elder Tallulah staring at her. </P>
<P>"You are dressed appropriately, so why don&#146;t you go and collect her mother.
  This is just a hunch on my part, but I&#146;ll bet she&#146;ll be happy to see
  you," said Tallulah. When Poppy smiled the old woman could see what her granddaughter
  had fallen for. There was nothing you could call feminine about Poppy, but it
  wasn&#146;t unattractive. It was in Tallulah&#146;s opinion what was attractive
  about her. Poppy reminded her of her late husband Fred. Not a man of many words
  but had a look about him that made you want to follow him into hell if necessary.
  "You wouldn&#146;t happen to have a jacket in that vehicle would you?"</P>
<P>"Yes ma&#146;am I do. If you would be so kind as to direct me in the right
  direction," said Poppy. She stood up and handed Tallulah her sleeping namesake,
  and waited for an answer.</P>
<P>As the SUV drove away, Tallulah whispered after it, "Go and get what&#146;s
  yours Poppy."</P>
<P>The grounds and buildings of the country club she drove up to told Poppy a
  lot about the people who belonged. They all had money and plenty of it, and
  they wanted people to know that they money and plenty of it. Poppy was willing
  to bet that if she took a quick tour of the place she would find no African
  American, Mexicans or other assorted minorities on the grounds unless they worked
  there. It all had a formal uptight feel about it, which made her laugh. <I>I
  thought you came to places like this to relax and exercise, not get your underwear
  all in a twist.</i></P>
<P>She followed Tallulah&#146;s directions until she was at the main clubhouse
  that housed the club&#146;s restaurant. Poppy took the light linen tan jacket
  off the hanger in the backseat and slipped it on. The light jacket matched the
  pants she had on, and together with the trademark white cotton shirt, made Poppy
  blend in with everyone else around her. She opted to take the sidewalk that
  lead to the back of the building betting that she would find a large pool. <I>These
  places are all laid out the same</I>, thought Poppy. </P>
<P>Julia was half listening to her mother drone on about everything she needed
  to do to get her life back in order as she looked out toward the pool. "The
  first thing Julia, is a trip to the boutiques to get you some new clothes. The
  fall season will be upon us before you know it and you have to look decent for
  the circuit parties. I&#146;m sure that you looked fine for life on some island,
  but you are back in civilization now," said Janice. For the first time in ten
  minutes the prim woman noticed that she was facing the back of her daughter&#146;s
  head instead of her face. "Julia, are you listening to me?"</P>
<P>The blonde head shook as she watched the scene unfold outside. When the first
  woman sat up a little in the chaise lounge she was sitting in, Julia didn&#146;t
  pay it any attention, but when heads were popping up like fishing corks she
  looked to see what they found so interesting. A row of faces were lowering their
  sunglasses discreetly to watch the tall woman pass by. Julia had seen the look
  before in the coffee shop in New Orleans, when the young clerk had gotten an
  eyeful of Poppy. Janice watched as a slow smile curled her daughter&#146;s mouth
  at the sight of the casually strolling stranger out by the pool. The two black
  eyes and the cast on her arm didn&#146;t take away from the looks this woman
  possessed, the elder Johnson woman noted. </P>
<P>Poppy walked down the pool deck looking for the back way into the restaurant.
  As she had predicted, the building had a wall of glass that looked out to where
  she was walking, and from behind the sunglasses, Poppy looked for her prey.
  The cold air felt good when she opened the door into the building and walked
  to the entrance of the restaurant called The Garden Room. Julia watched as the
  golden money clip made an appearance with one of the waiters blocking Poppy&#146;s
  path. Just as quickly the man stepped aside pointing toward their table. </P>
<P>"May I join you for lunch?" asked Poppy. She would have arched her brow, but
  the pain in her face prevented too much movement. Her mouth though, worked fine,
  and she smiled for the woman she had come to see. It was a relief when Poppy
  saw Julia smile back. </P>
<P>"Mother would you excuse us for a moment," requested Julia as she stood up.
  The tall body bowed a little bit and let her walk past as Poppy smiled at Julia&#146;s
  mother.</P>
<P>"Armando who is that thug?" asked Janice. The waiter placed the shrimp cocktails
  the women had ordered on the table and looked in the direction Julia had headed
  in. "I don&#146;t know ma&#146;am, but I&#146;ll try and find out for you."</P>
<P>Julia led them to one of the empty ballrooms on the other side of the building.
  They walked the whole way in silence, waiting for more privacy before starting
  their much-delayed talk. When the solid wood door closed behind them, Julia
  turned to Poppy and fought the urge to fall into her arms like she had the day
  before. <I>Has it been only a day since that happened?</i></P>
<P>"What happened to your face?" Julia asked softly. The bruises looked angry
  and painful, but strangely enough, they somehow brought out the blue of Poppy&#146;s
  eyes.</P>
<P>"Your brother punched me in the face for hurting your feelings," answered Poppy.
  She took a step closer, then stopped to gauge Julia&#146;s reaction.</P>
<P>"Tell me that the broken hand doesn&#146;t mean that poor Rayford is hospitalized
  somewhere in the Caribbean?" asked Julia. She was starting to feel the body
  heat emanating off Poppy&#146;s body as she moved closer to her. </P>
<P>"No, poor Rayford is just like you left him. I don&#146;t even think anyone
  has told him yet exactly who he knocked into the pool in his frenzy to protect
  you."</P>
<P>They stood there looking at each other without saying another word. Poppy knew
  that she wasn&#146;t married, and with the resort owner&#146;s being here, it
  told Julia that maybe her grandmother had had a point. Going with her gut like
  she had so many years before, Poppy took the plunge. With her good hand she
  reached out for Julia and bent down to reach the lips she had been thinking
  about since her first taste of them. Julia needed no further encouragement,
  and fell into the body she visited in her dreams since they had met.</P>
<P>It was slow and soft. The kind of kiss you tell your grandchildren about when
  you spin tales of how you fell in love with the person sitting next to you fifty
  years down the line. Julia would remember it that way. The plastered hand that
  was holding her close and the fingers in her hair belonged to the person she
  wanted that future with. This was the person that had slowly swept her off her
  feet, with her gentle manner and sweet soul. </P>
<P>Poppy pulled back just a little not releasing the woman in her arms and said,
  "Don&#146;t ever leave me again without talking to me first. That&#146;s all
  I ask of you."</P>
<P>"I just saw Jillian on your porch that morning, and thought I was not wanted
  or needed."</P>
<P>"Julia never be afraid to ask me what I want or need. I can promise that the
  answers will always be honest and they will never be Jillian."</P>
<P>"Not that I&#146;m complaining, but how did you find me?" asked Julia. </P>
<P>"Tallulah told me where to find you," said Poppy. She kissed Julia again just
  because she was so close.</P>
<P>"Smart girl, that daughter of mine. Now tell me why you are here?"</P>
<P>"I wanted to see you and that daughter of yours first off. Secondly I want
  to take you out on a date. That is if you want to go out with me?" asked Poppy.</P>
<P>"Let&#146;s start with introducing you to my mother, it might change your mind
  on wanting to take me out on a date," said Julia. She reached for the unplastered
  hand and walked Poppy back to the table she had been sharing with her mother.
  "Armando, would you please set up the table to include my friend and bring her
  a menu?" "Of course Miss Julia, it would be my pleasure."</P>
<P>Poppy pulled out Julia&#146;s chair before turning to face the woman burning
  holes in her back with hazel eyes. "Mother I would like to introduce you to
  Poppy Valente. She is Rayford&#146;s boss, and my friend," said Julia. She waved
  a hand in Poppy&#146;s direction hoping that her mother wouldn&#146;t embarrass
  her. </P>
<P>"Julia I don&#146;t know what kind of prank you are trying to pull, but this
  person is not welcome at our table. Just look at her. What will people think?"
  asked Janice. She had placed her hand at the center of her chest and looked
  like she might pass out at any moment.</P>
<P>"Mother please, Poppy is my guest," said Julia through clenched teeth. </P>
<P>"Julia let me handle this. Now Poppy is it? My daughter and I are not interested
  in having lunch with you. I mean just look at you. Are you some drug lord or
  something?" asked Janice. Poppy watched as Julia&#146;s mouth hung lower as
  every word came out of her mother&#146;s mouth.</P>
<P>Looking at Julia, Poppy laughed. "What is it with your family and my name?
  The only one that doesn&#146;t have a problem with it is your grandmother. Ladies,
  I am sorry to bother you. I&#146;ll leave you to enjoy your meal. Julia take
  care of yourself." Heads turned as Poppy made her way to the front door. In
  one moment the heat had swallowed her and she was gone. </P>
<P>Julia watched the door close and it sent a pain right through her heart. They
  had just been kissing, and now Poppy had given up so easily. Why wasn&#146;t
  she as willing to fight for her like she had for Carly?</P>
<P>"Julia where are you going? Sit down this instant, or I will be forced to tell
  your father about this outlandish behavior," hissed Janice. The coifed woman&#146;s
  admonishments fell on deaf ears as her daughter followed the same trail out
  of the restaurant that Poppy had just taken.</P>
<P>"You know the problem with families is? You can&#146;t pick them, they are
  preordained," said Poppy. She was sitting on a bench outside the building waiting
  for Julia to come out of the doors. Julia stopped in her tracks and turned around
  slowly. The jacket had come off and was thrown over the back of the bench, and
  the long legs were crossed making Poppy look like she was just out there waiting
  for a bus.</P>
<P>"I thought you had left," said Julia. She stood her ground and waited to see
  what Poppy would do next. The relationship, if they were to have one, would
  have to be a partnership of equal emotions as well as responsibility.</P>
<P>"No honey. The first rule of business is that you never walk away until you
  get what you came for." Poppy stood up and started toward the woman that had
  brought her more than a thousand miles from where she had started.</P>
<P>"Is that what I am to you? Business?"</P>
<P>"No you are something much more than that. You are someone special to me Julia."
  She walked until they were barely touching and then held out her hand. Without
  hesitation Julia took it and was once again pulled into a heated kiss. Julia
  could hear the slowing down of some golf cleats, and knew it would be minutes
  before her mother would find out about the show she was putting on outside.
  The problem was she didn&#146;t care.</P>
