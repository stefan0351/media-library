<P>&quot;Sus, do you remember Charlie&#146;s wedding?&quot;
  asked Poppy the next morning from her New Orleans office. In between the grand
  opening of Carly&#146;s Sound two weeks away, and the finishing touches ready
  on the next property they were trying to acquire, she was trying to give Julia
  the wedding day she wanted. The more Poppy thought about it, the more fun she
  thought it would be to go over the top of what she figured Julia had in mind.
  The woman in front of her looked at her like she had grown horns at the question.</P>
<P>&quot;You&#146;re kidding right? That is not one wedding
  I will be likely to forget anytime soon. When Emily St. Claire puts her mind
  to it, the old girl can put on quite the show. I&#146;m just glad Charlotte&#146;s
  marriage held up after the money they must have poured into that one. Why do
  you want to know that?&quot; asked Susanna. It had been a surprise when Poppy
  had come in whistling that morning and stepped into her office. Elizabeth must
  have known the boss was coming in since she had moved down the hall to her own
  office for the time being. </P>
<P>&quot;We are going to recreate that particular affair,
  and you have three months and two days to pull it off. Why don&#146;t we start
  with inviting Mrs. Emily St. Claire to lunch so we can pick her brain. Stop
  looking at me like that, I&#146;m going to help you.&quot; Poppy smiled up at
  her assistant, mostly from the fact the woman in front of her looked faint,
  and the memory of picking a date with Julia the night before.</P>
<P>&quot;Who are we doing this for?&quot; asked a stunned
  Susanna. She slumped against Poppy&#146;s big desk, and wondered whom Poppy
  had promised to plan their wedding for them.</P>
<P>&quot;Me,&quot; said Poppy pointing her thumb to her
  chest.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah right. And who, may I ask, are you marrying?&quot;
  </P>
<P>&quot;Miss Julia Emily Johnson of Houston Texas,&quot;
  said Poppy. The Rolodex on her desk was turned to the right page and Poppy picked
  up the phone to call the socialite she had met years before, stopping when Susanna
  stopped talking. Poppy was shocked to find her assistant crying in front of
  her desk looking slightly green.</P>
<P>&quot;But&#133;You are getting married?&quot; asked Susanna
  again. She had noticed a change in Poppy when she walked in that morning but
  would never guess that it was because she had fallen in love again. </P>
<P>&quot;That she is Susanna, so start getting used to the
  idea that Poppy might actually be happy again. You remember that don&#146;t
  you? The person that would break out into song for no apparent reason, the same
  one that would dance with you in the copy room. Remember her?&quot; asked Elizabeth.
  Poppy had indeed called her that morning to tell her the latest developments.
  Elizabeth could hear the baby in the background as Julia gave her a bath. They
  had shared breakfast at the hotel to review the contracts Elizabeth had been
  working on, and she had seen it. The easy manner was back, as was the sharp
  humor that set Poppy apart from the person she had become after her mother&#146;s
  death. Her only hope was that Julia deserved Poppy. Some of the attorney&#146;s
  fears had been put to rest when Poppy gathered her into her arms and told her
  their relationship would never change, and she wanted Elizabeth&#146;s blessing
  as to what she was doing.</P>
<P>The lunch with Emily in one of the uptown restaurants,
  was enough to get them started. Knowing the woman&#146;s panache for entertaining,
  Poppy was not surprised when she showed up with a neat folder with all the information
  she would need. The St. Claire butler still showed up every year on her doorstep
  with the invitation to the Mardi Gras ball Emily hosted, but it had been at
  least three years since Poppy had attended. At Carly&#146;s death, Poppy had
  figured Emily would stop sending the invitations, but Emily had been a true
  friend through the whole ordeal. </P>
<P>&quot;Maybe you will start responding in the affirmative
  from now on to my invitations Poppy. It hurts my feelings when you are not there
  to waltz with me. This year I want no excuses since I would like to meet this
  woman that has stolen your heart. I have a feeling that you are as lucky as
  I know she is with this latest development. If you would allow me, I would like
  to offer my assistance so that your wedding day goes off without a problem,&quot;
  said Emily as she sat with Poppy and Susanna at lunch. </P>
<P>&quot;I would be honored if you would Emily. Your friendship
  meant the world to Carly, as it has to me. That night that you danced with me
  will be one of my most treasured memories. You gave me something that night
  that I will always be grateful for. You gave me, and Carly legitimacy in New
  Orleans. Not that I needed other people&#146;s approval, but I think it made
  Carly feel better to know that she didn&#146;t have to give up all of her old
  life to be with me.&quot; Poppy reached across the table and took Emily&#146;s
  hand into hers. She liked the woman simply because she marched to her own drummer
  and made her own rules as she went along. If you didn&#146;t like it, you didn&#146;t
  have to stay in her inner circle of friends.</P>
<P>&quot;I&#146;ll tell you something Poppy. I didn&#146;t
  need to give you anything that you didn&#146;t already have. Your Carly would
  have followed you into the gates of hell if you had but asked her. She loved
  you fiercely and it made so many people jealous to see you two so happy. If
  I know Carly, she is looking down on you now and smiling on your newfound happiness.
  Now if you don&#146;t mind, I&#146;ll be taking this lovely young lady with
  me and we&#146;ll get busy planning a special day for you.&quot; People nodded
  their heads as the queen of New Orleans society made her way to the door with
  Susanna at her side. Poppy was heading back to the office to make more phone
  calls before heading back to her two girls. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The week flew by as they finished their business in the
  city. The staff of Carly&#146;s Sound had been put to the test in the last week
  and had pasted with flying colors according to Miguel. Starting the next Saturday
  they would be opened for business. The reservations log showed that for the
  next sixteen months they were booked solid. Poppy had guessed right, in that
  there were people who were interested in relaxing for a week or longer at a
  time with nothing else to do but sun and enjoy good food. </P>
<P>Per her instructions, the bungalow was ready for their
  arrival that Friday, and had undergone some redecorating curiosity of Ginger
  and Matlin. The guestroom had been transformed into a baby&#146;s room, and
  the bed in the master suite had been switched out with another one Poppy had
  restored that had been in storage in New Orleans. The piano had been swept clean
  of most of its photos so that Julia would feel comfortable during her stays
  there, but there were still some of Carly and Elizabeth up. The two friends
  figured Poppy would want to remember some of the good times they had shared
  here.</P>
<P>Miguel and the helicopter were waiting for them when
  the plane landed that evening. The hotel manager grimaced when he saw the bruises
  around Poppy&#146;s eyes and the cast on her hand. He hadn&#146;t had the heart
  to tell Rayford exactly whom he had punched out the day his sister had left,
  and unless Julia had called and told him the young man was still in the dark.</P>
<P>&quot;How are you Poppy?&quot; asked Miguel. Poppy glared
  at him through pain filled eyes. She had undergone the surgery to fix her nose
  two days before they had left, and the pressure of the cabin had made swollen
  sinuses more miserable on the flight over. Julia&#146;s only salvation had come
  from the pain medication the doctor had prescribed before they had left. It
  would be nice to spend some recuperating time in their bungalow while they were
  back on the island.</P>
<P>&quot;I&#146;ve had better days Mickey. Let&#146;s just
  go before my head explodes and you both have to clean me up off this tarmac.&quot;</P>
<P>Julia carried Tallulah toward the vehicle she had first
  flown to Carly&#146;s Sound exchanging greetings with Miguel. She was looking
  forward to seeing her brother again and spending time alone with Poppy. Their
  relationship was new but when they had been in New Orleans, Julia had had to
  share Poppy with too many people for her own comfort. The blonde figured there
  was still so much that they didn&#146;t know about each other, and this would
  be the perfect time to learn. Susanna had told her that it was Poppy&#146;s
  custom to spend up to a year at each new place to make sure the service and
  facilities were all in proper working order. It had been Poppy&#146;s hope to
  just spend some time in the bar at night singing a while, but in her current
  condition there would be no music.</P>
<P>By the time the sun went down, they were resting comfortably
  together in the hammock on the porch. Poppy slept behind Julia leaving the small
  woman to think about the time they had already spent here and what life with
  Poppy would be like. </P>
<P>&quot;What are you pondering there my little sweetpea?&quot;
  asked the burly voice behind her. Julia looked up to the bruised face and grimaced
  in sympathy. Poppy had been grumpy for the whole day, but Julia couldn&#146;t
  blame her. Poppy looked like her face should hurt. </P>
<P>&quot;How much I love it here, and how much I love being
  here with you. I know we can&#146;t live here, but I would like to come back
  as often as we can. Tallulah should know where her parents fell in love don&#146;t
  you think?&quot; asked Julia. Julia felt the arms that were holding her tighten
  around her waist, and Poppy&#146;s soft breath ruffle her hair. The curly head
  lifted a little and looked at the sleeping baby on the blanket close to them.
  </P>
<P>&quot;I think we can show the princess the fact that
  we are in love on a daily basis baby. On a different subject, Lizzy and Susanna
  are flying out in a couple of days. They are stopping and picking up your grandmother
  and her friend on their way. Seems Tallulah needed to get her &#145;cabana wear&#146;
  together, whatever that means. If I&#146;m feeling better by then, want to go
  into Aruba with me and pick up the Pied Piper?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think that can be arranged love, but only if
  you&#146;re feeling better. I want you all nice and healthy as soon as possible,&quot;
  said Julia as she arched against Poppy enjoying the backrub the woman was giving
  her. </P>
<P>&quot;Well if it hadn&#146;t for your brother, speaking
  of which, where is the little shit?&quot; asked Poppy.</P>
<P>&quot;I really don&#146;t know, I haven&#146;t seen him
  since we got back. Poppy please tell me that you aren&#146;t going to kill him.
  Dr. Landry said you&#146;ll be good as new once the swelling goes down, and
  Ray is the only brother I have. I am almost sure that if he had known who you
  were, he wouldn&#146;t have hit you,&quot; explained Julia. Julia was rubbing
  Poppy&#146;s stomach like she had seen the tall woman do to Tallulah countless
  times hoping to calm her down. For someone that had enjoyed singing all her
  life, Poppy sounded like a cross between a chipmunk and a parrot with a sore
  throat. </P>
<P>&quot;Yeah well he deserves a pop if you ask me,&quot;
  said Poppy. She was enjoying the attention Julia was lavishing on her so much
  that she didn&#146;t hear the heavy footsteps coming up the path. </P>
<P>&quot;You want me to kiss it and make it better?&quot;
  asked Julia. When she got a slow nod the blonde moved up and initiated a slow
  kiss that had Poppy forgetting about her nose and her arm. </P>
<P>It was the man screaming, &quot;What in the hell do you
  think you are doing with my sister?&quot; that broke them apart. Actually it
  scared Julia so much that she rolled off the hammock, which threw Poppy off
  balance causing her to crash over the other side. When she landed on her back,
  the force of the fall caused Poppy&#146;s nose to start bleeding. The last thing
  Rayford remembered, until he came to, was the look on Poppy&#146;s bloody face
  as she got up and stalked over to him to deliver her own punch. </P>
<P>&quot;Maybe Dr. Landry gives family discount rates,&quot;
  said Julia when she looked down on her brother. She knew by looking at him that
  he would have one hell of a shiner by the morning, but at least Poppy seemed
  to feel better and was oblivious to the fact a pint of blood had just drained
  out of her nose.</P>
<P>The next morning Rayford sat in his kitchen with an icepack
  on his eye while Julia sat across from him and explained just who Poppy was.
  The eye that wasn&#146;t swollen shut was blinking at her furiously, as Julia
  could see the &#145;oh shits&#146; flying through his brain. </P>
<P>&quot;Oh my God! I punched the owner of Valente Resorts,
  and broke her nose? Why in the hell didn&#146;t anyone tell me?&quot; asked
  Rayford. He got up from the table and started looking for the folder that they
  had given him in training. </P>
<P>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Julia. The color
  draining from his face when she told him what Poppy&#146;s position was had
  concerned her for a moment, until he made a mad dash for the pile of papers
  on the small desk in the living room.</P>
<P>&quot;I&#146;m looking to see where she owns all her
  properties, because believe me if there is one next to hell that&#146;s where
  I&#146;m going to be transferred to.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ray calm down. Poppy is in the vacation business,
  so I&#146;m sure all the properties are in decent locations where people are
  interested in going. Besides nothing is going to happen to you so chill,&quot;
  said Julia smiling at him.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, how do you know?&quot; asked Rayford. Julia&#146;s
  smile got wider and she waved her left hand in his direction. He tried to focus
  with his one good eye but even from this distance Rayford could see the diamond
  on his sister&#146;s finger.</P>
<P>&quot;She gave me this and asked me to marry her, so
  I&#146;ll protect you from the fury of Poppy Valente. Which brings me to the
  other reason that I&#146;m here. I introduced her to mother and she wigged out,
  which probably means she went home and told dad. Translation to that conversation
  is that he is now wigging out too, so I have no one to walk me down the isle.
  Interested?&quot; asked Julia. Rayford wasn&#146;t convinced by the light banter
  coming from Julia. He could see that it was hurting her that their parent&#146;s
  couldn&#146;t be more supportive now that she had found love and the person
  she had waited for. </P>
<P>It had come as a big shock to Rayford when Julia had
  told him she was pregnant. He had always known that his sister wasn&#146;t that
  interested in men, and was fanatical about commitment. Ray was never disappointed
  in her, and knew that alone or with the help of someone, Julia would be a terrific
  mother. </P>
<P>&quot;So you love her huh?&quot; he asked. Rayford moved
  back to the table and took the seat next to Julia&#146;s. Their relationship
  had always been close, and they had always been each other&#146;s best friend
  so he was happy for her. </P>
<P>&quot;Yes I do. Poppy is the one person in this world,
  besides you Ray, which loves me no matter what my faults. In those two short
  months I spent here, I fell so hard for her it scared me that she wouldn&#146;t
  feel the same,&quot; said Julia. She explained to him Poppy&#146;s history and
  her relationship with Carly.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you sure about this Julia?&quot; asked her
  brother. </P>
<P>&quot;As sure as I am that Tallulah is my daughter.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well then I need to do the manly thing and have
  a talk with Poppy and make sure she&#146;s clear on her responsibility to the
  two of you,&quot; said Ray. He bit his lower lip hoping that the woman wouldn&#146;t
  finish the job she had started on his eye when he did talk to her.</P>
<P>Rayford worked up the courage to confront Poppy two days
  later. He found her in the small office toward the front of her bungalow sitting
  with Elizabeth. The two looked up from the slew of contracts in front of them
  to see Rayford dressed in his uniform shifting from foot to foot. </P>
<P>Poppy wasn&#146;t going to make it easy on him as she
  leaned back in her chair and pinned him with an icy stare. The effect was more
  menacing with the two black eyes causing Ray&#146;s shifting to become more
  pronounced.</P>
<P>&quot;Cut him some slack Poppy before he wets his pants,&quot;
  whispered Elizabeth into her ear.</P>
<P>&quot;Hi I&#146;m Elizabeth Stevens. I&#146;m Poppy&#146;s
  stepdaughter and her attorney,&quot; said Elizabeth holding out her hand. Rayford
  stared at her for a moment trying to figure out her introduction before shaking
  her hand. The blonde was about Julia&#146;s height and had the prettiest blue
  eyes he had ever seen.</P>
<P>&quot;Rayford Johnson, I&#146;m Julia&#146;s brother.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know. I&#146;ll leave you two to your talk. Poppy,
  I&#146;ll wait for you outside,&quot; said Elizabeth. She leaned down and gave
  Poppy a kiss on the cheek before stepping out of the room to head out to the
  porch. When she stepped outside, Elizabeth found an equally nervous Julia pacing
  with Tallulah. &quot;She won&#146;t kill him I promise. Not this close to the
  wedding anyway.&quot;</P>
<P>For thirty minutes Rayford apologized profusely for breaking
  her nose then moved on to praising Poppy for her accomplishments. A solid ten
  minutes was devoted to telling her how much he loved his job and his interest
  in continuing it. The now sweating man stopped talking when Poppy reached into
  her pocket and pulled out a small round container and threw it to him.</P>
<P>&quot;What&#146;s this for?&quot; asked Rayford looking
  at the small Carmex container in his hand. </P>
<P>&quot;After all that ass kissing you just did, I figured
  you might need some lip balm Rayford. Now how about we cut the shit and you
  tell me why you are really here?&quot; asked Poppy. That finally got Rayford
  to calm down enough to see that Poppy didn&#146;t hate him. He laughed as he
  pocketed the lip balm and stood up and held his hand out.</P>
<P>&quot;Hi, I&#146;m Rayford Johnson, and Julia is my twin
  sister.&quot; Poppy stood up and took his hand in a firm handshake and gave
  him a friendly smile.</P>
<P>&quot;Rayford Johnson, I&#146;m Raquel Poppy Valente,
  and I am in love with your sister Julia. As her other family representative
  I would like to ask you for her hand in marriage. I should tell you that I already
  spoke to Tallulah and she gave me her blessing, but it would be nice to have
  you on our side too,&quot; said Poppy.</P>
<P>&quot;If you promise me that you will do right by her,
  and my niece, you will always have my blessing. Julia is a special woman and
  she deserves someone that will love her, and be at her side for the rest of
  her life,&quot; Rayford said seriously. He put his palms on the end of her desk
  and waited for an answer. </P>
<P>&quot;Rayford, your sister will always be loved, and
  she will never want for anything including my love and attention. And your niece
  will be raised like she were my own. That&#146;s all I can promise you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That&#146;s all I can ask for. Be good to her Poppy,
  and I am sorry about your nose,&quot; said Rayford as he stood and shook her
  hand again. They walked out together and Poppy watched as Julia&#146;s brother
  wrapped her in a bear hug and whispered something into her ear. It couldn&#146;t
  have been bad because Julia looked at her over his shoulder and smiled. </P>
<P>&quot;Thanks Ray, I will, I promise.&quot; Julia waved
  to him as he walked back toward the resort area to get back to work. When soft
  lips pressed up against her neck, Julia turned around and pulled Poppy&#146;s
  head down toward her. With only a little encouragement the mouth that was on
  her neck opened and accepted her tongue and let it explore to its heart&#146;s
  delight. It was the feeling that Julia hoped would never die, the feeling she
  got from being held like this while possessing Poppy&#146;s mouth. &quot;He&#146;s
  right I should take care of you. You&#146;re a keeper.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you sure you don&#146;t want me to come with
  you?&quot; asked Julia for the fourth time. &quot;What if you start not to feel
  well?&quot; asked Julia. Out of an old cedar box on the mantle, Poppy had pulled
  an old tin container in the shape of the cartoon character Betty Boop. Poppy
  had put it in a waterproof bag and was heading out to the Piper with a persistent
  blonde on her heels. </P>
<P>&quot;Baby come and sit with me for a minute,&quot; requested
  Poppy. She sat in the old whicker rocker and pulled Julia onto her lap, putting
  the bag on the floor next to them. In her lap sat her future, which she kissed
  and held until Julia relaxed against her. On the floor sat her past, which was
  waiting to be set free of its confines. Elizabeth was waiting on the Piper,
  so that she wouldn&#146;t have to do it alone, and Poppy wanted to reassure
  Julia before she left.</P>
<P>&quot;Baby, there is one more thing that I have to do
  for Carly, and it&#146;s something she asked me to do before she died. While
  I&#146;m sure that she has loved living in this charming container she found
  at some flea market, it&#146;s time to let her go. I put it off thinking that
  this was my last link to her,&quot; said Poppy pointing at the funny tin bombshell.
  Carly did have a sense of humor, even about the most bizarre things, like where
  her ashes were to be kept until Poppy released them. &quot;But it turns out
  she&#146;s in here,&quot; she said pointing to her heart. &quot;I will always
  have love for Carly, and I will always have Lizzy in my life, but it is time
  to lay her mother to rest. She wanted to be here, where she found much of her
  happiness. It doesn&#146;t matter that I am the one who found this place, she
  loved it here and here she will remain. Though, knowing Carly, she will find
  new places to haunt and discover as she enjoys whatever paradise she was sent
  to. Our adventure, though, has just begun my little butterbean, so I don&#146;t
  want any old baggage getting in the way. I love you and I promise I won&#146;t
  take long.&quot;</P>
<P>Julia leaned in and kissed her again. She loved the fact
  that Poppy was always honest with her feelings and that she was not going to
  so readily forget the woman that had shared most of her adult life. As much
  as Julia wanted to go with her, not out of jealousy but out of concern for Poppy,
  she knew it was something Poppy and Elizabeth needed to do alone.</P>
<P>&quot;Promise you&#146;ll be careful?&quot; asked Julia
  when their lips parted. </P>
<P>&quot;I promise baby.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When she lifted anchor the sun was low in the sky, Carly&#146;s
  favorite time of day. They had often sat out on the porch or on the beach and
  watched the big orange ball make its final decent into the water. As she pointed
  the sailboat away from the island into open water, Poppy remembered all the
  dreams they had voiced during those sunsets. For once, the thoughts didn&#146;t
  make her want to cry out of pain, but out of the happiness for the opportunity
  to have done them with the woman she had loved. There had been so many firsts
  with Carly, but Poppy was starting to get comfortable with the idea that there
  would be so many more in her lifetime. </P>
<P>&quot;You once told me, that you get only one chance
  at the big game. To do it justice you must live every day to its fullest. The
  one thing that pisses God off more than anything is to die without having enjoyed
  your life. Do you remember that Poppy?&quot; asked Carly. For once Poppy didn&#146;t
  care if it was a figment of her imagination. It would be easier to say good-bye
  this way. Poppy looked at the woman standing by her side and smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes I do my love. You did an admirable job of it,
  even if you did get off to a late start. I like to think that you made up for
  lost time once you cut loose.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks to you. Poppy you know that I loved you,
  but I wanted to make sure that you knew how grateful I was to you. You always
  called me the wise one, but it was you that taught me some of my most valuable
  lessons, and I wanted to thank you again. I want you to be happy, and I want
  you to be a good parent to your children. Not that you need my approval, but
  you made a good choice in Julia. In her, you found the other half of your soul
  and your one true love,&quot; said Carly. She smiled up at the charmer that
  had stolen her heart. There was closure now and Carly felt ready to move on.</P>
<P>&quot;I appreciate that Carly, she is really special
  to me. I love her, and I promise to be good to Tallulah. Though it would be
  nice if the kid had a nickname,&quot; laughed Poppy.</P>
<P>&quot;Ask her mother what her middle name is. I&#146;m
  surprised she hasn&#146;t told you already, but maybe she&#146;s been scared
  to, knowing what she knows about you. Remember that I love you, and I will always
  be looking out for you my love. We&#146;re here baby,&quot; said Carly as she
  disappeared. </P>
<P>Elizabeth and Poppy stood side by side as Poppy let the
  boat sail where it wanted to for a while. Popping the top of the container off,
  they watched as Carly&#146;s ashes took to the wind, scattering it seemed in
  all directions at once. &quot;Goodbye my love, safe journey,&quot; said Poppy.
  Poppy slipped the rings Carly had worn from the time of their ceremony into
  Elizabeth&#146;s hand, and then held the crying woman in her arms. They had
  come full circle and Poppy was ready to get back to the life that awaited her.</P>
<P>That night as Poppy held Julia close to her, she remembered
  something Carly had said before she had left. &quot;Baby can I ask you something?&quot;
  said Poppy. Julia moved up to lie on top of Poppy to hear the question. </P>
<P>&quot;Sure you can sweetheart. What is it?&quot; asked
  Julia, kissing Poppy&#146;s bottom lip.</P>
<P>&quot;What&#146;s Tallulah&#146;s middle name?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You wouldn&#146;t believe me if I told you,&quot;
  said Julia. She wondered why this would come up now.</P>
<P>&quot;Try me,&quot; said Poppy. She could feel the body
  draped over hers shiver a little so she ran her hands along Julia&#146;s back
  for comfort.</P>
<P>&quot;Her full name is Tallulah Carly Johnson. I just
  liked the name Carly, but I wanted to honor the woman that had raised me so
  Tallulah came first. Once I got to know you, I didn&#146;t know how you would
  react to it so I thought about changing it if it made you uncomfortable,&quot;
  said Julia. Julia remembered the first time she had held her daughter and thought
  about what to name her. It was as if someone had whispered the name into her
  ear and it seemed to fit. The laughter coming from Poppy broke her train of
  thought and Julia laughed along with her.</P>
<P>&quot;You always were dense when it came to what women
  want Poppy, so I thought I would point you in the right direction,&quot; said
  Carly. Poppy couldn&#146;t see her, but she could hear the distinctive voice
  in her ear. </P>
<P>&quot;No baby it doesn&#146;t make me uncomfortable.
  She&#146;ll probably grow up to think we named the island after her, and that&#146;s
  ok with me.&quot;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&quot;Ray would you stop pulling on that collar, you&#146;re
  going to mess up you shirt,&quot; chided Julia. They were standing at the back
  of an old church outside of Nice, in the French Rivera. Inside were three hundred
  of their closest friends waiting to watch Julia walk up the isle and marry the
  person she loved most in the world. When Poppy had promised different and special,
  she had definitely delivered. </P>
<P>At the front of the isle stood Poppy, in a suit that
  matched Ray&#146;s, waiting for her. The newest resort in the Valente chain
  was housing all their guests back in Nice, and Bob had flown a larger jet with
  their families on board. Everyone else was treated to chartered flights that
  had flown them in three days ago. When Poppy had driven Julia out to where the
  wedding would take place, Emily St. Claire had tagged along with them to tell
  Julia the history of the place. The ancient castle, which sat on the mountainside
  situated between the ocean and the French countryside, had been in the St. Claire
  family for generations. The church they were in today was part of the castle&#146;s
  holdings, as was the great banquet room where the first reception would take
  place. Once everyone got back to the resort there would be another party waiting
  to continue the festivities. Julia had wanted a fairy tale, and Poppy had done
  her best to make her wishes come true. </P>
<P>&quot;Did it have to have this many ruffles?&quot; asked
  Rayford, running his hands along the front of the shirt. </P>
<P>&quot;Yes it does. It&#146;s what all the French autocracy
  is wearing,&quot; said Emily, causing Julia to laugh. She had taken an instant
  liking to Poppy&#146;s friend, who reminded her of her grandmother in so many
  ways. Not caring if it wrinkled the dress she had picked out, Julia leaned over
  and hugged Emily to thank her for her hard work.</P>
<P>&quot;She is waiting for you lovely girl, but I came
  to ask you a favor,&quot; said Emily as she held Julia lightly by the shoulders.</P>
<P>&quot;Sure if I can,&quot; said Julia.</P>
<P>&quot;Be good to her Julia, and love her beyond the limits
  you think you can. And promise me you will have her in New Orleans, next month,
  for my ball,&quot; requested Emily. </P>
<P>&quot;I promise to both things.&quot;</P>
<P>Poppy saw that the doors at the back of the church opened
  and the music started. Taking a deep breath she waited for Julia to walk out
  on the arm of her brother. Had anyone bothered to look to the front of the church
  they would have seen the brightest smile Poppy had ever shown in public lighting
  her face. The blue eyes took in the simple white long dress that Julia had on,
  the crown of flowers in her hair and the small bouquet of Texas yellow roses
  she carried, and thought she was the most beautiful bride in the history of
  weddings. Poppy didn&#146;t take her eyes off of Julia as Rayford shook her
  hand after kissing Julia, then taking his seat. </P>
<P>Isabelle and Raphael&#146;s parish priest stood at the
  alter awaiting them. Their union wouldn&#146;t be sanctified in the eyes of
  the church, but the older priest thought differently. The God he believed in
  would never truly condemn true love. </P>
<P>After the preliminaries were out of the way, Poppy faced
  Julia and took her hands in her own. &quot;My love, I found you in the strangest
  of places, at what seemed to be the bleakest moment of my life. Ever since then,
  you and your little girl have opened the doors of my heart and let the sun back
  in. I&#146;ve been told that for every person there is perfect match. The person
  that will always welcome you home and love you. Some are unfortunate in that
  they never find them, but we are fortunate, us two. I promise to always love
  you, cherish you and give you comfort. I promise to take care of you, share
  my life with you and love you above all others. Today I give you my heart and
  my solemn vow that you and Tallulah will never want for anything that is within
  my power to give you.&quot; Poppy finished her vows and kissed both of Julia&#146;s
  hands. Poppy wiped away the few stray tears that had leaked down Julia&#146;s
  face with her thumb, wanting to just skip to the part where she got to kiss
  the girl.</P>
<P>The bruises had long since faded from Poppy&#146;s face,
  and the cast was gone from her right hand. Once her nose had healed her voice
  had come back to its original state, to which she was grateful so that she could
  sing for her bride. Without the need of instruments, Poppy took a deep breath
  and started. </P>
<I>
<P>She&#146;s got a way about her</P>
<P>I don&#146;t know what it is</P>
<P>But I know that I can&#146;t live without her</P>
<P>She&#146;s got a way of pleasin&#146;</P>
<P>I don&#146;t know what it is </P>
<P>But there doesn&#146;t have to be a reason anyway</P>
<P>She&#146;s got a smile that heals me</P>
<P>I don&#146;t know why it is</P>
<P>But I have to laugh when she reveals me</P>
<P>She&#146;s got a way of talkin&#146; </P>
<P>I don&#146;t know why it is</P>
<P>But it lifts me up when we are walkin&#146; anywhere</P>
<P>She comes to me when I&#146;m feelin&#146; down</P>
<P>Inspires me without a sound</P>
<P>She touches me and I get turned around</P>
<P>She&#146;s got a way of showin&#146; </P>
<P>How I make her feel</P>
<P>And I find the strength to keep on goin&#146;</P>
<P>She&#146;s got a light around her</P>
<P>And everywhere she goes</P>
<P>A million dreams of love surround her everywhere</P>
<P>She comes to me when I&#146;m feelin&#146; down</P>
<P>Inspires me without a sound</P>
<P>She touches me and I get turned around</P>
<P>She&#146;s got a smile that heals me</P>
<P>Oh I don&#146;t know why it is</P>
<P>But I have to laugh when she revels me</P>
<P>She&#146;s got a way about her</P>
<P>I don&#146;t know what it is</P>
<P>But I know that I can&#146;t live without her anyway</P>
</I>
<P>&quot;I love you Julia.&quot;</P>
<P>In the first pew, the baby Tallulah looked up at her
  big teddy bear, and waved her arms at her to get her attention. At almost eight
  months, Tallulah recognized that voice anywhere. Both the baby and Poppy enjoyed
  their early mornings together as Poppy fed Tallulah a bottle. Julia was thrilled
  as the bond between the little girl, and Poppy grew. Their daughter would never
  want for love or attention from her mate.</P>
<P>On the alter, Julia had to take a minute before her voice
  would work again. The big warm hand that held hers was the only thing that she
  was focused on now, that and the big blue eyes that held only love for her.</P>
<P>&quot;I&#146;m so happy that you belong to me. If I were
  sitting out there looking up here, I would be thinking that the woman by your
  side must feel like the luckiest woman alive. I&#146;m standing up here, and
  let me tell you, that&#146;s how I feel. A year ago life seemed so scary for
  me. I think that Tallulah and I would have made it on our own, but I&#146;m
  glad that we have found our champion. On the day you found us, you sang just
  like you did today, only then it was to put our baby girl to sleep. I know you
  remember those green eyes looking up at you with adoration, like she had a sixth
  sense that you would be there for her always. If you had looked across the table
  at her mother, you would have found the same look on her face and in her eyes.
  I know that you are the other half of my soul Poppy, just like I know that for
  me, there will never be another who will own my heart. My promise to you is
  that I will always love you, honor you, comfort you and hold you above all others
  in my heart. My vow to you is that in my arms you will always find a home, and
  your family. I love you Poppy and I want you to always know that.&quot; When
  Julia was finished it was her turn to wipe tears from Poppy&#146;s face. It
  took them both a moment to realize that the priest was talking to them.</P>
<P>&quot;Raquel and Julia you have made your promises and
  vows before God, your family and friends. Raquel do you have a ring for Julia?&quot;
  asked Father Justin. Elizabeth who was standing behind both of them handed Poppy
  a ring.</P>
<P>&quot;Julia take this ring as a sign of my love and commitment,&quot;
  said Poppy as she slipped the wedding band on the slim finger, then put the
  engagement ring back on. </P>
<P>When Elizabeth handed Julia the new gold band, she held
  it up to Poppy&#146;s finger. Gone was the tan line from the one Poppy had worn
  for so long. Julia looked at it as her opportunity to make her own mark on Poppy.
  Inside was inscribed the words that had come to Julia when she picked the ring
  out for Poppy. In her short time with Poppy, it had shown Julia why Carly had
  engraved what she did in the ring Poppy had worn for so long. Poppy had given
  that ring to Elizabeth along with those of her mother&#146;s. It was what had
  inspired Julia&#146;s own version of words. <I>You are my living love song &#151;
  Love J.</i></P>
<P>&quot;Poppy take this ring as a sign of my love and commitment,&quot;
  said Julia as she slipped it past Poppy&#146;s knuckle. </P>
<P>&quot;Go on Poppy, and do what you&#146;ve been waiting
  for,&quot; said Father Justin with a wave of his hand. &quot;Kiss your girl.&quot;</P>
<P>Julia reached over and grabbed Poppy by the lapels pulling
  her forward. When she felt the big hands settle on her hips, Julia ran her fingers
  through the short curly hair and welcomed the lips she was now familiar with.
  Julia tightened her hold when she felt her feet leave the ground. Now that she
  was Julia Valente, she did feel like floating. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The party went on without them as the newly weds retired
  to their room. They had been up in the large suite, that overlooked the Mediterranean,
  for over two hours and Julia felt like she couldn&#146;t possibly reach another
  pinnacle, but the large hand sandwiched between her sex and the bed was proving
  her wrong. </P>
<P>&quot;Slow baby. Take it slow,&quot; she requested. Poppy
  had her facing the bed and was lying on Julia&#146;s back. Poppy could feel
  Julia&#146;s point of need grow hard again against her middle finger. All Poppy
  had to do was hold it steady while she moved them up and down with her hips.
  On every downward thrust, the tip of her fingers slipped between drenched folds
  sending Julia on another exotic trip.</P>
<P>When Poppy felt the walls of Julia&#146;s sex start to
  contract on her finger the small woman beneath her screamed, &quot;Oh&#133;..
  fuck me hard.&quot; It was a little out of character for Julia, but Poppy seemed
  to find amusement in the fact that in the throes of passion, her partner seemed
  to relax her usual language just a bit.</P>
<P>&quot;I&#146;m trying to baby,&quot; Poppy said into
  her ear.</P>
<P>&quot;Poppy unless you want me to hurt you real bad,
  you will not joke at a time like this,&quot; ordered Julia. She moved faster
  against the point of pleasure Poppy was providing, feeling the orgasm start.</P>
<P>&quot;Time like what baby?&quot; asked Poppy to keep
  her talking.</P>
<P>&quot;Holy shit, I&#146;m coming,&quot; was the last
  thing Julia could get out before all her concentration shot to one area of her
  body. </P>
<P>Poppy rolled off of Julia and went to open the doors
  to the balcony so the breeze off the water could come in. When she got back
  in bed she snuggled Julia to her chest once the spasms had stopped. When her
  breathing returned to normal, Julia reached up and kissed her. She could taste
  herself on Poppy&#146;s mouth and the desire flared again. </P>
<P>&quot;Honey did you ever see the movie &#145;Casa Blanca&#146;?&quot;
  asked Julia. She ran her finger along Poppy&#146;s ear feeling the woman shiver.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes I have, why do you ask?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Give me a few minutes to recover from that last
  one, then you can play it again Sam.&quot;</P>
<P>Tallulah held her great granddaughter as she slept, and
  talked with some of the guests. She paused in her conversation when she heard
  the rich laugh coming from the open doors above them. &quot;Your mothers are
  off to a good start little princess. There is nothing but blue skies in your
  future kid and I couldn&#146;t be happier for you.&quot;</P>
