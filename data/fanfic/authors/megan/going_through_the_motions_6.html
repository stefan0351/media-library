<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 6 -->

<p>I wake up with a fierce headache. I wake up because of the fierce
headache. I wake up and the first thing I see is Sam staring intently
at me. I'm lying in my bed on my left side, and she's sitting
in my chair right in front of me. She sees the exact moment I wake
up, the exact moment I open my eyes. And she smiles. I don't
smile back. She doesn't expect me to.</p>

<p>Instead I try to remember what it was that put me in here. A big
mistake. The memory shoots through my mind in such a massive pain
wave that I wince in agony.</p>

<p>"Oh hey, do I look that bad?", Sam tries to kid her way onto
my good side again. And fails again. I'm not that big on jokes.</p>

<p>I roll onto my back and press my right hand on my forehead, "I
have a killer headache."</p>

<p>"Figured that much. You also have a killer bump a little to the
left", Sam says, and I move my hand and feel it out. It isn't
that big, there's a sore spot but I'd hardly call it a bump,
"There's some pills and water on the night table."</p>

<p>Thank you Sam. I sit up with a groan and pick up the three pills on
the table, "Didn't dare to leave the whole jar in case
I'd gulp them all?", I say and drown the pills with some
water.</p>

<p>"You need more?", she says not the least bit hurt. Why is she
so calm?</p>

<p>I shake my head and turn to look at her again. She's still
staring straight at me. Straight into me. And the thought I tried to
bury, the thought my aunt planted, surfaces again. The thought of Sam
loving me.. why is it so hard to believe it?</p>

<p>"What happened?", Sam asks all of a sudden.</p>

<p>I shrug and turn away, "I fainted. It was really hot today. And I
guess I laid in the sun too long", good lie Brookie. She'll
fall for that one for sure.</p>

<p>"Riiiight.. funny thing that sun. Never know when you've had
enough", she says, and I nod.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because of our history. How can I believe her when
she's spent the last six months hating me, fighting with me? But
then there's that old saying, it's a thin line between love
and hate. Of course that is always used in reference to...
romantic... love...</p>

<p>Slowly I turn back and still she's drilling a hole into my head
with those brown eyes. It can't be so. I must've really hit my
head hard. It can't be so, "Saaam...?", I drag the name
too long.</p>

<p>"What?", she asks. And for the first time since I woke up she
looses her cool. For the first time she can't see what I'm
aiming at. I stare at her my mouth open. It can't be so, "What
Brooke?", she's getting impatient. Even worried, "Are you
all right? Does it hurt somewhere else?", she says and stands up.</p>

<p>I still don't get a word out. All these moments from the past,
our past, are parading around in my head. And I look for a hidden
meaning behind every word Sam has ever said to me, behind her every
action. There were those millions of times I caught her staring at
me. I always figured it was just... just what? Her looks were never
hateful, well sometimes they were, but not every time. Sometimes they
were just curious. And intense. Always intense.</p>

<p>Sam's hand lands on my face and distracts my thoughts. She's
feeling out the bump, "Brooke? Say something. Are you all
right?"</p>

<p>I jerk back my head and Sam immediately does the same to her
hand, "Yeah. Never better", I say returning my eyes to her.
Sam's feeling uncomfortable, squirming about, and finally she
takes a couple of steps backwards. Oh god, what if it is so?</p>

<p>"Are you sure?", the tension keeps on rising.</p>

<p>I nod, "How long was I out anyway?", maybe if we do the inane
conversation thing, thing's will easy up.</p>

<p>"About three hours", Sam says, "Maybe we should go see a
doctor, you know just in case?"</p>

<p>We?, "We?", okay what's that about?</p>

<p>Sam frowns, "Yeah. We, as in you and me", she says,
"It's a pronoun."</p>

<p>"So it is", I force a smirk on my face, it is after all
expected, "Well, we is fine. Just a little sleepy still."</p>

<p>Sam hovers there for a moment longer and then sighs and turns to
leave, "Okay, holler if you need anything."</p>

<p>After Sam's gone I lie back down. More confused than ever.
Strangely enough I feel a little better. As long as I can just keep
my mother out of my head, everything'll be all right. This Sam
stuff is way effective in that respect. But it won't hold for
long now that she herself is gone. And for the first time since the
accident I find myself wishing I wasn't alone. Because, already I
can feel mom edging her way in. She's waiting behind the wall. And
maybe I should let her in. Maybe she can explain. She's good with
explanations.</p>

<p>Sam's pills are making me woozy. I think I will sleep for a
little while longer. Dream the good dream.</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>The funny thing about Sam's room is, that it's so much cozier
than mine. Mine is cold, feels like no one lives there. But Sam's
room is cute and comfortable. And I don't know why that is.
It's nothing material, I know that much. If you just compare the
stuff in her room, and in my room, there's not much of a
difference. So it must be something that doesn't reveal itself to
the naked eye. It must be something out of this world. Maybe it's
Sam herself. Maybe she makes people feel welcome around her. And
maybe that reflects itself into the room. The same way I seem to
repel people, so my room naturally does too. Whatever it is, it is.
And it can't be helped.</p>

<p>Besides, that's just stuff. This is real. I'm standing in her
room in the middle of the night. All fussed up. I have my make up on
and I even washed my hair. It smells appleish. And I'm dressed in
one of my silky nightgowns. The goldish one I tried to seduce Josh
with. What a waste of time that was. This won't be. This
can't be.</p>

<p>Sam is still sleeping. She'll wake up soon though, she has to.
And I can wait. I have to wait. Because I have to know. I have to
feel it. I have to feel her love. I'll take it in any shape, in
any form she's willing to offer it. I'm desperate for it.</p>

<p>When I woke up an hour ago, I realized why I've been sleeping my
nights so well. It's because at night, in the dark, the
loneliness pushes on stronger than ever. It consumes everything, and
sleep is the only escape. But tonight it didn't work. I
couldn't sleep. And when I couldn't sleep I started to make
up all this stuff in my head. Stuff about my mother, stuff that
hurts, stuff that I need to get rid off. And the only way to do that
is through Sam... please open your eyes Sam! Pretty please...</p>

<p>And she does, "Brooke..?", she says with a sleepy voice and
sits up.</p>

<p>"Shhh..", I hush her and close the distance between us.
Quickly so she doesn't have time to think.</p>

<p>"But wha..", is the only thing she gets out before I cover
her mouth with mine. I try to make the kiss passionate, but it feels
only desperate. It takes Sam so completely by surprise though, that
she doesn't notice the difference. She just goes with it. She goes
with it when I push my tongue into her mouth, she goes with it when I
slowly press her back down onto the bed, "Brooke. Wait", she
manages to pant out when our kiss ends.</p>

<p>"No talk", I answer very sure of myself. I can't give her
one second to think. She'll end this for sure. That is why I lie
down on top of her and press our lips together again. One of my hands
is buried in her hair, and the other one slides carefully under her
pajama top. Every move I make is planned ahead. An hour is a long
time, and while my body was making itself presentable, my mind was
plotting on the best approach. Cause this has to be done just right.
Sam's not stupid, she'll notice the smallest mistake I make.
When my hand reaches her left breast and starts to caress it, I
slowly release her mouth and move down. She makes a soft moan when I
start kissing her neck. I remove my right hand from her hair and
place it on her mouth. She immediately starts kissing it and licking
it and nibbling on it.</p>

<p>It goes on for a time and I can feel Sam's lust growing. Her
actions become more and more aggressive, her hands are roaming around
my body and her mouth starts to look for mine again. I am not exactly
sure at which point it happens, but somewhere along the line our
roles change. Sam becomes the aggressor and I let her do whatever she
wants. Just like I planned. I let her roll us over so she's on
top. I let her lift my nightgown up, I let her hands go where-ever
they please. I let her make love to me. Just like I planned...</p>

<p>Only not. I don't feel the pleasure I thought I would. I only
feel the desperation. I only feel the need. I push myself harder
against Sam in hopes of achieving something pure out of this. But it
doesn't work. When I finally reach the climax, I don't cry
out from pleasure like I thought I would. I only moan a sigh of
relief into her shoulder. I don't feel loved like I thought I
would. I only feel like shit for using Sam. Using her true feelings
for my own selfish goals.</p>

<p>Sam rolls off of me and starts stroking my hair. I can't look at
her. Oh my god, what have I done? What have I DONE?,
"Brooke?", she says when I just lie there still as a corpse.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry", I mumble under my breathe and try to stand
up.</p>

<p>Sam doesn't let me. She grabs my hand and holds onto it,
"What?", she is totally confused. I've hurt her worse
than I could've ever even dreamed of. She just doesn't know
it yet, "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Please Sam. Let's..", let's what? Let's pretend
like it never happened? I take a quick glance at her. The expression
on her face is filled with hope. She looks so precious. I can't
shatter it, not now, "We'll talk in the morning, okay?",
I flash her a smile. It's a sad smile I know, but she doesn't
see it. She sees everything in roses.</p>

<p>"Okay", she nods and smiles back. And at that moment I could
swear I feel loved. And I could swear I love her. But it's only a
brief moment in time and it passes by so fast.</p>
