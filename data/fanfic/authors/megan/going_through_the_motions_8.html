<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 8 -->

<p>She has changed. She's not an angel anymore. Her hair is slightly
darker and shorter and on ponytail, and her face is slightly thinner.
It's too thin. She looks tired, she looks sick. Her whole
appearance is worn out. And she's wearing an old blue dress with
lots of different flowers in it. I remember that dress from my
childhood. But I don't remember this woman.</p>

<p>She stands up quickly when I step into the room. And boy was Sam
right, she is so much more nervous than me. It's almost like her
whole body is shaking. And there's a smile on her face, only it
looks more like she's crying. She opens her mouth to talk, but it
takes a long time before she says anything, "H.. hi Brooke",
the words barely manage to carry over the room. She waves her hand as
she talks. And it trembles worse than anything I've ever seen.</p>

<p>Sam has stopped, and so have I. We're standing fifteen feet
apart. It's my turn. My move. I can either ease her suffering a
little, or I can make it worse. And even though this sadistic part of
me wants to make her feel like shit, I won't do it. I won't,
"You came", I say and watch as she tries to nod. It seems
though, that she has even more trouble controlling her body than I
have mine, "Why?"</p>

<p>She takes a deep breath and seems to calm down a bit, "Be.. cause
you asked."</p>

<p>"No I didn't", I say before I can stop myself. Don't
make it harder for her!</p>

<p>The crying-smile disappears and it's replaced by a blank
expression. A one she has practiced a lot, I can tell. It shows
nothing. No emotion. And it hides her natural beauty so well, no one
would ever give this woman a second glance. With a twinge of panic I
realize it's the same face I've been wearing for the past two
weeks. She keeps it on for some seconds, before trading it in for a
normal one. As normal as she can muster I guess, "That's
right... you didn't", she tries to smile again, and fails,
"And I'll leave if you want me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, how noble of you."</p>

<p>This time she takes the hit better. Only lowers her gaze for a
second. When she raises it again her eyes meet mine. And now I
recognize her. Because of the sadness in them, "I'm sorry
about your father Brooke", she says, and then adds quickly,
"A..and... Jane...", her look darts between me and Sam a
couple of times.</p>

<p>Like anyone cares for your condolences! I almost shout it out loud.
Almost. There's a lot of anger still in me. I thought I had let
go of it a long time ago. I mean she's here. And I wanted her
here.</p>

<p>"You want to sit down Brooke?", Jessica says when the silence
becomes a burden.</p>

<p>I just shrug and take a seat at the couch. Sam sits beside me, and
across the table my mother sits down on the armchair.</p>

<p>"I would..ve come before, but.. but I only heard from it...",
mom starts again.</p>

<p>But I don't let her finish, "That doesn't matter. What
matters is that it takes something like this for you to come see your
own daughter!", she looks away. She looks away and I see tears in
her eyes. Nearly a minute goes by and she doesn't answer,
"God! What is wrong with you?", I cry out in frustration.</p>

<p>She's still looking away, looking out of the window into our
backyard, "You've taken down the swing", what? Oh, the
swing. I loved the swing when I was a child. But I outgrew it, and
there was just no use for it anymore. There are times when I'd
still like to sit in it though, swing real fast, up and down, and
feel the wind. It's almost like flying, "You loved the swing.
You used to sit hours in it. Remember?"</p>

<p>Her head turns back and she's smiling again, "Don't",
I say to her shaking my head, "Don't go there", my
childhood is my own. She has no right to it. Not anymore.</p>

<p>"I live there Brooke."</p>

<p>What is she on? This woman is insane, "You live where?", I
say frowning.</p>

<p>"In the memories", she says still smiling. The shakes have
left her. She's not nervous anymore. How did that happen? When
did that happen?, "I live in your childhood. They are the only
happy memories I have."</p>

<p>Yeah. It was a blast, "Oh, sure. If you had such super fun time,
why'd you bail on us?", and why the hell am I listening to
you?</p>

<p>She glances to my left, where her sister is sitting. I wonder how
much she knows about it all. I wonder why I never had the nerve to
ask her anything. And I wonder why I'm praying that my mother can
answer my question.</p>

<p>"There is no reason that could ever justify it, I know that",
she says. At least she has the decency to look at me when she says
it, "All I have is a bunch of excuses. And I don't think you
want to hear them."</p>

<p>"And I don't know how you dare to make that assumption. You
don't know the first thing about me", I'm still talking
like I don't care, like she means nothing to me. But my mind
isn't buying it anymore. I guess deep down it's been waiting
for this all my life. Even if I could never forgive her, I still need
to be given that chance. It's my choice to make, and I have a
right to it.</p>

<p>Mom just stares at me. And I stare at her. It's almost a contest.
When she realizes that she backs down., "Well.. do you
want..", she looks at Sam and swallows, "Sam to hear it?"</p>

<p>The girl next to me shifts nervously. I can feel her hand brush
against mine. She's sitting real close to me. Do I want Sam to
hear it? No, I don't. Do I tell her that? She was real sweet in
the hallway, maybe she wouldn't mind waiting outside. I turn to
look at her. And she has turned to look at me. She would mind. Her
eyes are not as calm anymore. This time she's pleading for me.
This time I could do something for her. But why is she so keen on
staying?</p>

<p>"Brooke", Sam talks for the first time since we stepped into
the room, "Please tell your mother we have no secrets."</p>

<p>But we do have secrets. So many secrets. I press my head down,
"Maybe you could wait outside Sam?"</p>

<p>At first there's no reply. Then I feel her standing up, "Oh,
sure Brooke", her voice is so bitter I almost don't recognize
it, "Whatever you want Brooke. I'll just go stand by the
stairs till you need me again. Is that okay.. Brooke?"</p>

<p>I don't answer, I don't look up. I don't move a muscle. I
just wait for her to leave, "Sam, wait", my aunt finally
intercepts and rushes after her. I steal a quick glance over my
shoulder and see Sam just exiting the room. She's not stopping.
Jessica follows her a few steps behind leaving me alone. Alone with
my mother. I turn back and find her smiling at me. She smiles quite a
lot.</p>

<p>"This better be good then. I just hurt her pretty deep", I
say with a cold voice. How can she smile so much? I thought her life
was supposed to be shit.</p>

<p>"Go after her if you want to", she answers. And still smiles,
"I can wait."</p>

<p>"Just talk", Sam will be okay, nothing can keep her down. She
is the strongest person on this earth. Yeah.. she'll be okay.</p>

<p>She opens her mouth and is about to say something. A few seconds go
by and it seems she changes her mind and says something else,
"How much do you want to know?", the smile is finally gone.
Replaced by the initial apprehension. Somehow it makes me feel better.</p>

<p>"How about everything."</p>

<p>"Fine. Just remember I'm not trying to defend myself. You
wanted to hear it", she takes a deep breath and starts talking.
And it's like the words just fly out of her. Like they've been
trapped inside for too long, "You're not my first child
Brooke", oh good start mom! Exactly what I wanted to hear!,
"I had a baby boy at fifteen. Johnny. I raised him all alone for
two years. Until one day he got sick. And he got sicker. And then he
died. And even though the doctors said he was born with a bad heart,
that I couldn't have done anything, I knew it was my fault",
she talks with a surprisingly steady voice. I guess she has made her
peace with that stuff already. But I'm starting regret I asked
her. Should've known there was a sob story behind it. Isn't
there always?, "For the following year I shut myself down.
Nothing got in, nothing got out. I didn't even grieve for him, I
just shut out all feelings and went on living like a robot. And then
when I was eighteen I met your father. I met him at a time when I was
completely isolated from the world, completely alone. Desperate for
any kind of human contact, for anyone to love me", she goes on
and on. And I stare at her my mouth open. The words hit me with such
force I almost choke. How can she use those very words? How can she
know? How can we be so alike? But she's not looking at me and so
she doesn't see me gasping for air, "And it's not like I
didn't feel anything for him. I did love him in my own way I
think. But not enough. It wouldn't have lasted a year if I
hadn't gotten pregnant", she turns quickly to look at me and
sees my anguish. But she mistakes the reason for it, "Oh, I
didn't mean it like that Brooke! I was so happy the day you were
born!"</p>

<p>I close my eyes and shake off the gnarly feeling inside. Get a hold
of yourself Brookie! She's your mother, it's only natural you
deal the same way with the same stuff. Still.. it puts a new spin on
some things. But that's for later, "Yeah, don't
worry", I say when I open my eyes, "It's not like I
hadn't guessed already, that I was an unwanted bundle of joy."</p>

<p>"That's not true!", she says it loud. Too loud. Who gave
her the right to yell?, "I loved you from day one. And so did
Mike."</p>

<p>I settle for a glare. No point in arguing about something so
stupid, "Move. On."</p>

<p>She doesn't want to. She wants to argue. But she can't, cause
I get to call all the shots around here. So she gives up and
continues, "The few years after your birth were the happiest of
my life. I devoted them to you. And I got along with Mike quite well,
even though I hadn't loved him for a long time anymore", no
matter how much I'd like to think she's lying, I know she
isn't. My earliest memories are of my mother. I know she was
always there when I was a baby. But that's no comfort. It only
makes her betrayal hurt even more, "But you grew up. And needed
me less and less.."</p>

<p>"Grew up!", what the hell?!, "I was nine when you
left!"</p>

<p>I manage to scare her good. She almost jumps up from her seat,
"Like I said Brooke. They are only excuses", this time she
doesn't raise her voice. And she did say that, so just calm down,
"You were nine. And you had started your school a couple of years
back. I had all that time during the day and nothing to do with it.
So I started exploring the outside world. It was a place I had never
seen before, a whole different land with lots of pretty things, and
lots of different people. I started realizing all that I had missed.
I never got to just be me, free in the world , with no worries and no
responsibilities. I missed my whole youth and I wanted it back."</p>

<p>"And to hell with everything else, ha... mom?", I pour all my
self-pity into those words. I never liked the stuff anyways. It's
useless, and it's unattractive.</p>

<p>She looks happy when I call her mom. Even though I meant it as an
insult, "That was pretty much the gist of it. When I met Ray it
was all over. He had all these wild ideas about life, and how to live
it. And I so much wanted to be a part of it. Then when I ran away
with him, I just ran. I didn't think about anything, I just ran.
We got into a buss to New York. And you wouldn't believe the
feeling of freedom. It was such a rush to be sitting in that buss
knowing that I could go anywhere", she talks and I hear the
excitement in her voice, I see it in her face. And then she turns to
look at me and the glimmer in her eyes disappears, "Of course the
feeling subsided as soon as I came down from the clouds. It was
probably a month later when I called the first time, and hung up.
Then it was almost a  daily routine for about  two weeks, I dialed
the number and hung up after a couple of rings. Once or twice Mike
answered but I never got a word out. And every time it was harder to
pick up the receiver, until finally I gave up. Stopped trying."</p>

<p>I'm fine right until the last few sentences. But then slowly this
bad thing inside of me starts to grow. It's an overwhelming
feeling of pain. I don't want to cry in front of her. So I do the
only thing I can, I flee. I get up and I half walk, half run to the
door, "Brooke?", she calls after me. I barely hear it. I
thought I could take it, I thought that whatever she said it
couldn't be that bad. After all, I've gone through every
possible reason in my head. And hers was a pretty good one. I can
understand it, despite my biting comments and my mock hurt, I can
understand it. I can understand her leaving. It's not the reason
that pains me, it's not even the fact that she left.</p>

<p>It's that she wanted to come back. It's that she was SO close
to coming back, and then nothing. She just gives up. And as a result
we lost eight years. I lost eight years I was entitled to. Eight
years because she was too much of a coward to admit her mistake!
It's such a waste!</p>

<p>In the doorway I run straight into my aunt. She's coming in and
catches me by the shoulders when we collide, "Brooke? What's
wrong?", Jessica asks with a worried look about her. I try to
answer but it's not working, my mouth is not working. Instead I
look at her with my watery eyes. She looks back for a moment, and
then past me, at her sister. And her face hardens, "What did you
do?", she demands to know.</p>

<p>I don't hear the answer. If there even was one. I pull free from
Jessica's grasp and escape. Out the front door and away.</p>
