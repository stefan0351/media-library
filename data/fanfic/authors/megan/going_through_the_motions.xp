<chapter title="Part 1">
<p>It's funny how quickly things happen when a change is overdue.
Maybe funny is the wrong word in this case. Let's say...
interesting. Funny, interesting, whatever. They're just words,
words that mean nothing to me now. I can't see myself ever
feeling joy, ever being interested in anything again. All that
is in the past. My new life is much more simpler: eat, sleep,
study. Well at least sleep and study. I don't eat that much
anymore. Just like I don't feel that much either.</p>

<p>Sam is much stronger than me. She lost just as much, and yet
she's coping. I see the way she fights to get her life back
together, the way she tries to make sense of things. And I
try to reach inside of myself and find that same strength. I
used to have it. I was never one to give up. But now... I
don't see the point. My aunt keeps saying that the pain will
let up, time will heal, and I look at her. She doesn't
understand, and I don't explain. I don't tell her that the
pain has already gone. I don't tell her that I actually miss
the pain, at least it was a feeling. It's this emptiness
that is killing me. This total lack of emotions. She has
guessed something though. She knows, and Sam knows, that
there is something wrong with me.</p>

<p>They are talking about me right now. I can hear them in the
living room while I sit on the stairs and eavesdrop, "It's
been two weeks already", I hear Sam's clear voice. She
sounds worried. Worried about me. Weird.</p>

<p>"There are no time limits on grieving Sam", my aunt Jessica
says. She's the one who pulled the short straw I guess. When
they were deciding who should take care of us, "Brooke takes
things to herself. She feels things much deeper than most
people", I would smile at the irony of the statement, if I
could. But I don't know how to move my mouth into that
position anymore.</p>

<p>There's a silence and I stand up ready to leave, but then
Sam speaks again, "But it doesn't look like she's
grieving. She's like a zombie or something", Sam really is
very perceptive. Even through her own sorrow she has seen
what really is going on with me. Zombie... that's actually
very close to the truth, "When's the last time she
initiated a conversation?"</p>

<p>I ponder on Sam's question for a while. It's been a time.
Sure there were a couple of times after the accident. But
not a single one during the last week comes to mind, "It'll
pass Sam. You concentrate on yourself", Jessica finally
replies.</p>

<p>I take that as my que, and ascend the stairs quietly. The
biggest problem with my new life is time. There's just SO
much of it, and nothing to do with it. You can only sleep so
much. So I study. Not because I care one bit about school,
but because it passes the time. It's a shame nothing seems
to stick in my head, otherwise I might solve the mysteries
of the universe. Or at least A mystery. But no matter how
many times I read something it always escapes my mind. Maybe
it's like a defense mechanism, so I don't run out of books to
read. Then what would I do?</p>

<p>I barely manage to get into my room, close the door and sit
down at my table, when already someone's out to bug me,
"Brooke...", Sam's voice comes through the closed door,
"Are you in there Brooke?", so much for concentrating on
yourself, ha Sam? I don't especially enjoy the idea of Sam
giving me the third degree so I just keep my mouth shut and
hope she'll go away. No such luck, first I hear the handle
being pulled down and then the oh, so familiar screeching
sound the door makes when opened. I turn my head slightly
and use the mirror to spy on Sam. She takes two steps inside
my room and catches my gaze from the mirror, "What'ya
doin'?", I settle for a shrug, "I called from the
hallway. Maybe you didn't hear..."</p>

<p>"I heard", I say and finally turn around to face her,
"What do you want?"</p>

<p>She was expecting the hostile treatment. Doesn't flinch a
bit, "I thought maybe we could study together. That math is
like... hard."</p>

<p>Sam's vocabulary fails her so rarely that even in my
zombified state it amazes me. Before I even know it memories
flood over me. They come so quietly, so fast, there is no
fighting against them.</p>

<p>Sam and me in the kitchen. Sam and me bickering over whichever
stupid little thing. The reason is trivial, the fight is
everything. This time I say something that makes Sam gasp. And
then her mother walks in. She walks in just as Sam
screams, `Bitch!' `Sam!', she is shocked. Jane
isn't used to
our fights yet. They haven't lived with us that long. `But
mom... Brooke is like... she said...', Sam starts to stutter,
searching for the right words. And it is the cutest thing ever.
So I smile.</p>

<p>"What?", Sam asks and pulls me back to reality. Oh crap. I
liked it in the memory land.</p>

<p>I notice the confused expression on Sam's face. She doesn't
know whether to grin or frown, "What what?"</p>

<p>"You were smiling", she says, "You haven't done that
since... in a while", an embarrassed smile twists it way on
to her mouth.</p>

<p>I shrug again. It's such a great reply. Doesn't require any
thought whatsoever. And good for any situation. This time
though, I feel the need to elaborate myself a little, "Just
some happy memories."</p>

<p>Sam nods once, twice, "Yeah, I have a couple of those too",
why on earth she said that, I don't know. And apparently so
doesn't she. There's a pause, which I guess would've been
an awkward one in our post-accident life. Nothing's
awkward anymore though, "So, how about that study session?"</p>

<p>Oh yeah that. I had completely forgotten it already, "I don't
know Sam...", I try to think of a good excuse, "I'm
really tired... maybe tomorrow?", why do today what you can
put off till tomorrow.</p>

<p>Sam doesn't accept this. She sits down on my bed, an act which
earns her a frown from me, "Could we like, just talk then?"</p>

<p>Oh my God! I'm never getting rid of her. What could we
possibly talk about?, "Let me guess. You want me to tell you
how I feel about the accident. Cause it just isn't healthy to
keep these things inside?", I try to sound sarcastic. I'm a
bit rusty though.</p>

<p>Sam looks straight at me, "Not what I was gona say", yeah
right, "We can talk about anything. Or do anything. You can't
just block out the whole world Brooke."</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, seems I not only can do it, but I've actually
already done it."</p>

<p>"Well then undo it", Sam says sounding a little irritated.</p>

<p>"Why?", my tone stays the same. It hasn't changed in two
weeks, why should it now.</p>

<p>"Because if you don't, you'll never get over it."</p>

<p>Why do people always think they should get over the death of
a loved one? Or ones in this case, since I did love Jane too.
Not as a mother, but still I loved her. I don't want to get
over it. That's one step away from forgetting them. But I
don't tell this to Sam. I just keep staring at her. Until
she's had enough.</p>

<p>"God Brooke! What the hell is it? I lost them too you know",
Sam is loosing it. She is getting angrier and angrier by
each passing second.</p>

<p>I have to do something, to say something to defuse her,
otherwise there's no telling where this'll end,
"Sam...", I start bowing my head, "Just because I
don't talk about it, doesn't mean I'm not dealing with
it. Cause I am, you know. I do think about it a lot, and
I am making progress", lying is so much easier now. It's
like I only have to open my mouth and these things come
out. I don't even have to plan the lies in advance, I
just... open my mouth. I raise my head back up.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you", Sam answers. Just like that, she
sees through me and my lies. But her anger is slightly
subdued, "I don't believe you think about the accident at
all. And you're certainly not dealing with the effects it
had on you."</p>

<p>The old me would've bitten her head off for that response.
Not the new me though. The new me sighs and crosses her
hands, "Right... look I've tried to be patient here, but
the truth is, I can't stand your company Sam. Couldn't you
just... care less about me?"</p>

<p>Even that isn't enough to drive her away. It doesn't even
bring that anger thing back, "Good", she says, totally
surprising me. Momentarily. Then I realize she's glad her
words got an actual reaction out of me. Not just that
usual so what, "And no, I couldn't care less about...
you... wait. That sounded all wrong... I meant..."</p>

<p>"Whatever. Just leave, please", how dare she come in here
and start tearing down my safety walls. I spent an eternity
last week building them. She still doesn't move,
"Please", I beg again.</p>

<p>"Brooke..."</p>

<p>I cut her off quickly, "No Sam! No more talk! I want to be
alone", I jump on my feet ready to throw her out if need be.
I'm freaking out here. I need time to myself. Time to make
some repairs.</p>

<p>And finally she stands up, then hesitates for a second before
rushing out. I close the door behind her, lock it, and fall
on my bed. Burying my face into a pillow. I fight back the
tears that almost make it out. They are close, glistening my
eyes. But I can't let out a single one, cause if I do, then
they all want to come. And there's a LOT of them. So I fight.
It's not that hard when you know how. And I know. I take it
one second at a time. And I only concentrate on that second.
I don't think about anything but that precise second. And
then I move on to the next. And the next. They crawl by at
first but after a while they start to pick up some speed.
And pretty soon time is just flying by and I'm not crying.
I'm okay. And I don't even notice the drowsiness sneaking
up on me...</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 2">
<p>"Brooke!", a scream penetrates through the barrier that
separates the waking world and the dream world. I ignore it.
My dream isn't over yet, it has barely begun. Dreams are my
one comfort. In them I can still feel. In them I am happy
sometimes, sad at others. In them dad and Jane are still
alive. And we do stuff, we are a family, "Brooke!", it
comes again, this time accompanied by loud banging noises.
I still try to ignore the voices, but they've got a hold on
me now. They are pulling me away from my beautiful dreams,
"Brooke! Open the door!"</p>

<p>My eyes shoot open. This is the real world. The one where all
the insufferable voices are emitting from, "Brooke!", this
time I recognize the voice as Sam's. Figures. Last night
comes back in very vivid flashes. I guess I was wrong in
thinking my zombie state was permanent. It's not. Sam's gona
reverse it, I know she is. And I can't stop her. Nothing
short of killing her is going to stop Sam when she gets
something in her head, "BROOKE!", she yells even louder if
possible.</p>

<p>I get up and slouch to the door before she wakes up the whole
neighborhood. It takes a while for me to fumble first the
lock open and then the door itself, but Sam isn't screaming
anymore, so there's no rush. She's probably heard me through
the door.</p>

<p>I put on my most vehement face and pull open the door, "What.
Are. You. Doing?"</p>

<p>Sam gapes at me her mouth open. There's a single tear rolling
down her cheek. And she's fidgeting around like crazy, "You
didn't answer...", her voice trembles badly, "And I
thought... maybe something had happened... and..."</p>

<p>Oh, I see. I'm on suicide watch now, "You thought maybe I had
swallowed a couple of hundred sleeping pills?"</p>

<p>Sam is way upset. More tears start to dribble down her face and
if I had any compassion left in me I'd give her a break, "I
was just worried about you", she whispers through her sobbing.</p>

<p>Somewhere deep within me this feeling emerges. It surges through
the wall and I recognize it. Pity. I feel sorry for Sam. First
time for everything I guess. A moment goes by while I struggle
over what to do. A part of me wants to slam the door to her face
and bury this feeling-crap so deep it'll take a hundred years to
dig it back up. But the feeling-crap isn't cooperating. It wants
more control. It wants me to hug Sam. Say I'm sorry.</p>

<p>I settle for the middle ground. I don't apologize, but I
don't slam the door shut either, "Look Sam, you should take
my aunt's advice. Just concentrate on yourself. I'll live
through this, don't worry."</p>

<p>"How...?", Sam says and tries to dry off her eyes, "Have
you been listening in on us?", oh yeah, I wasn't supposed
to know that. Too bad. I shrug it off, "Could you...",
Sam's voice falters. She clears her throat and starts
again, "Could you stop with the shoulder shrugs? That's
like the most stupid answer ever."</p>

<p>"So I overheard you and Jessica. It was good advice, you should
take it", I refuse to acknowledge her remark on my new very
bestest response.</p>

<p>"I like your aunt Brooke, but to be perfectly honest, what the
hell does she know about any of this? When's the last time you
had any contact with her before the accident", Sam picks
herself up and brushes off the momentary lapse in self
control.</p>

<p>Okay, so my aunt really hasn't kept in touch lately. She sends
Christmas cards and maybe even an occasional present but the
last time I saw her, was some three years ago. She used to
come by often when I was little, when mom was still around.
But after that bitch split, Jessica kinda felt guilty for her
sister I guess. I never said anything to indicate that, and I
don't think dad did either, still mom was her little sister so
she felt at least partly responsible for her actions.</p>

<p>"Please don't badmouth my aunt", I say quietly.</p>

<p>"Didn't mean it like that. But she is wrong", Sam says
and turns around. I notice she's carrying her bag and
she's heading for the stairs. A quick glance at my watch
tells me I've overslept. Again. Once Sam reaches the
stairs she turns around again, "Oh, I came to tell you
school starts in half an hour. You planning on coming?",
I stare at her for a second and then nod. Sure. Why not?
School's just as good as any place. Sam opens her mouth
to say something more but decides against it then. She
leaves me standing alone in my doorway. That mom stuff
is still dancing around in my head, leaving me all
confused.</p>

<p>I'm gona be so late for school. There's no way I'm
leaving before a long shower. I feel all filthy and
sweaty and stuff. That's what you get for sleeping ten
hours in jeans and a sweater. Otherwise my morning
routines take much less time than they used to. I
usually just take a quick shower and brush my hair so
it won't hang on my face. All my make-up just sits on
the table. I won't touch that stuff anymore. A couple
of times I've thought of throwing them all away, but
something always stops me. After all the time I've
spent in front of the mirror enhancing myself it seems
wrong to just ditch all that stuff.</p>

<p>This morning rushes by with speed I thought impossible. Before
I know it the time is closing in on ten. That's two hours
I'm late already. Where the hell did those hours go? I
couldn't have spent them in the shower, could I? Maybe I
could've, who knows. Time is such a tricky thing. Sometimes
it won't move no matter how much you pray, and other times
it just flies by. Like today. Jessica is n the kitchen when
I make my appearance. She's a free woman these days. Dad
left a big allowance for our caretaker. I don't know if she
ever plans on going back to work. And I don't care.</p>

<p>When I enter the room Jessica lifts her nose from the paper
and smiles. When she smiles she looks just like my mother.
Only older, "Good morning Brooke. Sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Like the dead", let's try a little of that morbid humor.
Too bad Sam isn't here. She'd really appreciate it after
all that suicide talk.</p>

<p>My aunt doesn't know how to take it. The smile disappears and
she looks confused. Then she shakes her head, "There's
coffee. And I could make you some breakfast."</p>

<p>"Coffee's plenty."</p>

<p>"No, you gotta eat something Brooke", Jessica says and stands up.</p>

<p>I stare directly into her eyes, "Coffee's plenty."</p>

<p>Cool, there's power in my ice cold voice. And in my ice cold
stare. She sits down so fast that her own coffee spills, "Oh
damn!", she cries and uses the newspaper to clean up.</p>

<p>"Listen Jessica", the words jump out when I make my way to
the counter, "There's something I want to ask you."</p>

<p>I don't see her but judging from the silence she's stunned.
Of course she is. Even I'm stunned, "Sure Brooke. Ask away."</p>

<p>Little by little my hand starts to tremble while I pour the
coffee. It gets worse and worse until I have to set the pot
back down. I look at my hand and don't recognize it. It's got
a mind of it's own. It doesn't obey my commands, just shakes
there. No, that's not right. My mind is making it shake. It's
telling me to keep my mouth shut. Don't ask it. There's
nothing to be gained by the question. But I want to ask it.</p>

<p>Slowly I open my mouth and force the words out one by one.
Funny, the first one's came out all on their own, I couldn't
have kept them in even if I tried. And now these one's fight
back with all their might, "Why... didn't my... your...
she...", way to make a coherent sentence Brookie.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Huh?", I spin around. She couldn't have understood
anything from my ramblings.</p>

<p>"I don't know why your mother didn't come. I haven't
spoken to her in quite some time", so she did understand.
Had probably expected the question even. I have never
asked about my mother from her. I don't... didn't want
anyone toknow I still cared about what she did, where she
was. If she was all right. But during the couple of
visits Jessica made when dad was still alive, I always
listened around a corner when the two would talk. Hoping
and praying that dad would ask the question I didn't have
the guts to ask. And sometimes he did. And Jessica's
reply was always the same, `Last I heard she was in New
York', or Boston, or Philadelphia. Where-ever, but always
in the east, `She calls sometimes, asks for money,
asks how Brooke is doing', and dad would get all angry and
why doesn't she call here and ask for herself. But I don't
care. It's enough that she still asks about me. Means she
still loves me on some level.</p>

<p>But now, with dad dying and she doesn't even bother to
call... that's something evil, "She probably doesn't even
know about it", it's like Jessica's reading my mind. She
says just the things I want to here. And makes me feel all
good. Too good. Gotta watch it with these conversations. An
occasional feeling isn't that dangerous but if I'm not
careful, they can all slip out. And then I'm in trouble. No
way I'm capable of handling that kind of baggage.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's all the same anyway. I was just curious", and she
nods. Doesn't say anything just nods. There's just something
too weird about my aunt. She is like overly calm. Total
control. At peace, that's the one. At peace with herself.</p>

<p>I drink my coffee, politely shake my head when Jessica offers
a lift to school, and finally leave the house ten minutes
later. It's a beautiful day. Maybe I'll skip school. Go for a
little drive. Yeah... that sounds good.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 3">
<p>Staring at the sun, self inflicted pain. I think I heard it in a song
once. It's all wrong though. It doesn't hurt. Sure it brings
tears to my eyes, but there's no pain. Maybe if I could keep my
eyes on it for just a little bit longer... But I can't. It's
too beautiful, too bright. I have to look away. Have to gather my
strength and then look again. I can see it clearly only for a second,
then the picture starts to blur. There are lights everywhere, and
nothing makes sense anymore. My eyes are watering, and even though
they are not real tears, they feel almost as good. And are much more
safer. I can stop them whenever I want to.</p>

<p>It's a vicious cycle, one which I repeat countless of times. And
would repeat still as many a times if some idiot would only mind his
own business, "Hey? You okay?", the idiot says walking in
front of me. Blocking the sun.</p>

<p>I blink away the last tears and take a better look at him. Just the
type of guy you'd expect to meet at a beach, on a school day.
Some muscles on the upper body, not much but some. Decent looking
face, except for the god awful grin on his mouth. And of course a tan
to kill for.</p>

<p>My silence is throwing off his act. The grin fades away and he moves
his weight from one foot to the other. And back again, "Like we
just thought...", I look the direction his hand swings, slightly
to my left, and see two more guys standing some twenty feet away.</p>

<p>The guy never finishes his sentence, "Maybe you
shouldn't", I say and stand up.</p>

<p>He takes a couple of steps backwards and chuckles, "Shouldn't
what?"</p>

<p>I look at him again and frown, "Think", I say shaking my head
a little. Maybe I shouldn't be so bitchy. But I can't help it,
the guy ruined my afternoon. Slowly I turn around and start walking
towards the parking lot. He follows me. I can hear the soft steps
behind me. No I can't. I can feel them. I can feel his presence
invading my space.</p>

<p>"You're Brooke McQueen, right?", he asks a little too
loud. I turn and take a quick glance at him, all the while still
moving towards my car. I don't know the guy so I frown again,
"Yeah, I thought I recognized you. I go to Kennedy High too."</p>

<p>There's much more confidence in his voice now. So he knows me, so
what? Almost everyone at Kennedy knows my name. And I used to like it
that way. It was such fun when people knew me, and I hadn't a
clue who they were, "Good for you", I say and quicken my step
a little. The car is still fifty yards away.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you in school lately", maybe because
you're hanging around on the beach all day?, "You know, ever
since you were shun by the royalty. Whatever happened there?"</p>

<p>Oh, okay, it's just some loser on a power trip. Paying back for
all the times I've completely ignored him in the hallway. He might
stand a chance of hurting me, if I wasn't actually glad that I
don't have to deal with Nicole and Josh and the rest, "Stuff
happened."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure", god what an annoying asshole. He jogs up and
starts walking beside me, "But what stuff? Like was it about your
father and that whore he was driving around with? When he died?"</p>

<p>I grin and shake my head, "Sure, why not?"</p>

<p>He doesn't appreciate my stoic attitude, "You're one
cold-hearted bitch, you know that?", he says and stops in his
tracks. Of course I know, everyone knows that.</p>

<p>I keep power walking to my car, leaving him glaring at my back. The
best way to win an argument is to agree on everything the other one
is saying. And then just act like you don't give a fuck about the
whole thing. It always ticks them off. Okay, maybe you don't
actually win the argument, but you sure leave the fight the less
pissed off person.</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>I always take the Greenway Drive these days. Even when I'm
heading for the opposite direction. And every time these silly
thoughts rush into my head. What were they thinking? What were they
doing? Were they talking, fighting, laughing, moping? Were they
talking about their dinner plans? Me and Sam? Planning their wedding?
Was the radio on? What was playing on it? All these stupid questions.
Questions that will never be answered. And when the corner of
Greenway and Park Avenue comes to sight they get more intense. Was
the light green, or did they have to wait for it? Did dad, or Jane,
notice the other car before it hit? Did one of them have time to
shout a warning? Did dad try to swerve out of harms way? Did they die
instantly? Did they know they were gona die? Or did one of them die
in the crash and leave the other one alone wondering what the hell
happened. I try to imagine it. It's hard during daytime, but at
night it's easy. I just wait in the crossing for another car to
come from the left. And then press the gas. I pass the car from good
distance, there's never any danger of a collision, but the lights
of the other car are very helpful for my imagination. I can see it. I
can conjure them back. The horror he must've felt. He had to see
the lights. He had to know what was going to happen. Or maybe the
other car didn't have it's lights on. Then it could be he
never saw it coming. Or Jane. It's hard, so many different
scenarios. All of them possible. And I don't know which one to
pick. Just when I think I have the right one, something else pops up.
Something that doesn't fit that picture. Luckily I have a
lifetime to figure it out.</p>

<p>After I've passed the intersection, the ghosts slowly fade away.
Not all at once, little by little. I see them as they would've
been without the crash. Quietly chattering about whatever is on their
minds at the moment. I can't make out the words, but I can see
Jane's smile. And hear her laughter. It's always the last
thing to go. I can hear it long after her ghost has already
disappeared. I can still hear it when I pull into the driveway. And
then it's gone. Afraid to come home with me. Afraid because the
house is so cold now. It is empty, devoid of love.</p>

<p>Sam has invited some of her friends in today. To fill the emptiness.
She tries to get around the rules. She tries to counter the
loneliness by being in a crowd. It never works. You can be totally
alone even when surrounded by tons of people. I should know. Maybe it
works for Sam though. Her friends seem to care for her. Maybe around
such friends you don't feel lonely.</p>

<p>"Hey Brooke", Carmen chirps when I enter the living room.
She's sitting on the armchair facing the door and is the first
one to notice me.</p>

<p>Sam and Lily are on the couch and turn their heads when Carmen greets
me. There's a nervous smile on Sam's face, "Brooke, why
don't you come sit with us for a while?"</p>

<p>I frown. No thanks, "I don't..."</p>

<p>"Come on. We hardly ever see you anymore", Lily says.</p>

<p>Uh oh... something seems out of place here. It almost seems like they
are planning some sort of an intervention. God I hope I'm wrong,
"So? When did we actually see each other?", it's a sad
day when people with whom I barely exchange hellos have to come to my
rescue.</p>

<p>Sam has gotten up and is walking towards me. I take an unconscious
step backwards, like I'm afraid she might force me to stay. Maybe
I am afraid of that, "Just stay for a second. We can... do that
math thing. You promised to study with me today", she says
stopping some five feet away from me.</p>

<p>"When did I do that?", I answer trying to come up with a yet
another good excuse. Maybe that tired thing again? How's she gona
prove I'm not tired?</p>

<p>"Last night?", Sam is amazingly patient with me these days.
She plays along with all my stupid avoidance games.</p>

<p>I'm almost about to play the sleepy card when something comes to
mind. Something I thought of on the beach, "Oh! I can't right
now!", I'm so exited about having a real reason not to stay I
almost shout the words. And scare Sam in the process, "I mean I
have to talk to Jessica. Do you know where she is?"</p>

<p>She tilts her head slightly to the left and doesn't believe me
for a second, "Sure. She's in the kitchen", Sam says with
a smug face, "Mind if I tag along?"</p>

<p>I tilt my head and mirror her expression, "Not at all, Sam."</p>

<p>The smugness is gone and I'm satisfied. If she insists on
pestering me all the time, I can make it a little harder for her.
It's the least I can do. She follows me into the kitchen where my
dear aunt is making dinner. In the microwave oven. I kinda have to
admire her lack of ambition. She has nothing to do all day and still
doesn't bother to cook a homemade meal for us. Or maybe she
can't.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're home too Brooke", she says when I walk in
with Sam in tow, "How was school?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Brooke. How WAS school?", Sam just can't keep
quiet. She's trying to goat me into a fight. Trying to lure me
out of my hiding place. But I'm way too clever a girl to fall for
that one.</p>

<p>"How should I know? I wasn't there", leaving the question
alone I move onto the topic of today. Mom, "Listen Jessica",
I start with the very same words as this morning, "Is there a way
you could get in touch with her?"</p>

<p>She just looks at me. Concerned, "With who?", Sam asks
surprised. It's still kind of cool when I can do that to her. One
of those little things that make life worth living.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's what you want?", Jessica ignores Sam
completely.</p>

<p>"No", I answer without missing a beat, "Can you do
it?"</p>

<p>She shrugs and bows her head, "I have a number of... an
acquaintance of hers. I can leave a message for him", I can tell
she's not happy about my plan, "Your mom calls if she
calls."</p>

<p>"Your MOM?!", Sam yells loud enough to draw Jessica's
attention. And mine. And probably even Carmen and Lily's,
"The one who abandoned you when you were nine?!"</p>

<p>"I have to agree with Sam here, Brooke", Jessica says, "I
don't think it's a good idea."</p>

<p>"Too bad. My mother, my choice", so just shut up and do it,
"Make the call."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 4">
<p>I have this birthday card with a picture of Dorothy and Toto. Oz is
my favorite movie. I got the card, along with the video, for my ninth
birthday. I got them from her. Sure they both gave me a bunch of
other stuff together, but this present was only from my mom. I threw
the video away a long, long time ago in one of my anger bursts, but
the card still sits in the back of my drawer together with a picture
of my mom. On the back of the card it reads simply `Mommy loves
Pookie.' That's what I called myself when I was way little.
`Pookie wants a cookie. Pookie is a pig girl.' And that's
what my mother called me when we were alone. No one else in the whole
world knows that.</p>

<p>She gave me the present late at night, after dad was already asleep.
She slept in my bed that night, and I was the happiest little girl in
the world. A week later she was gone.</p>

<p>The card is like this magical doorway to my childhood. Whenever I
study it, all kinds of things from the past come to life. There's
my dad a few years younger, my childhood friends most of whom I've
lost contact to. How did that happen? How come I didn't make ONE
lasting friendship as a child? Harrison is the only one of them I
even see anymore. And that's just because he lives next-door.</p>

<p>But most vividly it brings back my mother. In all her beauty. Through
my nine-year old eyes she looked like an angel, with golden hair and
a caring smile. Now with my extensive life experience I can see past
that beauty, I can see past the smile she always wore, I can see
straight into the sadness that always hid beneath the surface.
It's there in her eyes. It's in the picture I have in my
drawer. It's in every picture I've ever seen of her. And
it's in my memories. It was there when I was making those
memories, I just didn't know what to look for.</p>

<p>"What'ya got there?", Sam's voice comes only a few
feet behind me and scares me half to death. No wait, I was already
there to begin with.</p>

<p>Still, the surprise is enough to make my arm swing in a wide arc and
knock down a glass of water on my table. Quickly I recover the card
from the table and raise it up to safety, only to have it snatched
out of my hand by Sam, "Hey!", I protest and jump up to face
her.</p>

<p>Sam backs away towards the door and is pointing at my table, "You
better dry that up before the water ruins the table."</p>

<p>"Fuck the table. Give me my card", I'm in no joking mood.
Haven't been in a while.</p>

<p>Sam on the other hand is, "Come on Brooke, you gotta learn to
share", she stops in the doorway. I take a hesitant step in her
direction. She grins and takes a step backwards.</p>

<p>"Sam please", I whine with my most pathetic voice trying to
collect some pity points. She raises the card to take a better look
at it, "I'll do anything!", I suddenly scream making her
head jolt back up, "I'll do anything you want if you give me
the card back", I repeat with a normal tone.</p>

<p>Sam stares at me for a long time, "Will you let me take a look at
it?"</p>

<p>So like Sam, always bending the rules. She doesn't want to
alienate me any more by looking at it against my will, so she tries
to find a loophole, "No. It's private."</p>

<p>She was expecting the negative response, "Will you tell me why
it's so important then?"</p>

<p>"It's not", oh god, what have I done? Like she's gona
believe that one.</p>

<p>At first there's no change in her expression, then slowly she
starts to laugh. Yeah, it's very funny. She knows she's got
the upper hand now. The laughter stops pretty soon when she realizes
the situation isn't funny after all, "Yeah right. For days you
haven't shown any interest in anything, and now all of a sudden
you go ballistic over a postcard? And there's nothing special
about it?", I have no reply.</p>

<p>My eyes become irritated and I blink them a couple of times. Slowly I
remove them from Sam and let my gaze slide to her left. That's
better, my night table is a much more comfortable sight,
"It's a birthday card", I whisper. Too quietly for Sam to
hear.</p>

<p>She heard me mumbling though. Or saw my mouth moving,
"What?", she gives me plenty of time to answer. I don't,
"Look... okay, take the card. I'm sorry I teased you
Brooke", I hear her steps as she walks closer, but I keep my eyes
fixed on the table. Just in case Sam's playing some sort of a
trick, "Here. Take it."</p>

<p>Quickly I turn my head back to her. She's standing at an
arm's reach holding out the card. I'm still skeptic. She has
the advantage, why doesn't she use it? Why doesn't she break
my armor? Warily I reach for the card and take a hold of it,
"Di... did you...", why is my throat so dry all of a sudden?
It makes talking harder, "Look at it?"</p>

<p>She shrugs her shoulders, "No. I mean I saw the picture. Dorothy
and that dog from the movie", that's not so bad. As long as
she didn't look at the back, "It's pretty", I look at
the card. It is pretty, but that's got nothing to do with why I
love it. I usually don't even see the picture, just the memories,
"It's from your mother, right?"</p>

<p>It takes a few seconds for the words to sink in. She lied. She did
look at it  No, why would she lie and then confess to it right
after? "How'd you know?", I ask not looking up.</p>

<p>"I've got a brain, Brooke. There are precisely two things
that have gotten a reaction out of you. Your mother and that
card", I nod, "So I just put two and two together."</p>

<p>There's something different about Sam when I look at her again.
Usually her stare feels like it's penetrating right through my
skull, but not now. Now it's softer, kinder. And it's not
just the stare, it's everything about her. She's giving me
time and not pressing for the answers like usually. Like last night.
And it's working better too. I wanna tell her things. And I would
if not for this tiny voice in my head still screaming, `It's a
trap! She's got some hidden motive, she doesn't care about
you.' And even when my twisted little mind realizes how stupid
that sounds, a part of me believes it.</p>

<p>Finally I open my mouth, not fully knowing what's gona come out,
"I thought you were having trouble with math", uh oh... that
sounded like a joke.</p>

<p>Sam's face lights up like a candle. She sees this as some major
breakthrough. I've gotten her hopes up, and then when nothing
actually changes she'll be crushed. Again. In a way this
`Save the Brooke' project of hers is more important to her
than to me. By helping me she's helping herself deal with the
pain.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I am", she says after a while, "Could you help me
with it?"</p>

<p>"Sam", I say and sit down so I don't have to look at her
when I shatter her hopes, "I know you've kinda taken it upon
yourself to... I don't know... rescue me or something. But honest
to god, there's nothing you can do."</p>

<p>She's silent. And I don't dare to look up. Almost a minute
goes by without a word spoken. I know cause I watch the seconds tick
away in my clock on the table. Which is still wet by the way. I
don't know why Sam was so worried, it doesn't seem to absorb
any water. I grab a couple of tissues from the open drawer and start
to dry up the table. Sam's still not talking. Should I get
worried? A quick glance over my shoulder proves that she's still
standing there. There's nothing soft in her eyes anymore though.</p>

<p>She speaks when I turn my attention back to the table, "Lying in
god's name, Brooke? That's not good", she falters
slightly when she talks. I managed to really hurt her, "Not good.
I suppose you think your mother can help you?", her voice drips
of poison.</p>

<p>Done with my cleaning, I turn around again and look at Sam. Her eyes
have narrowed into tiny slits, and her mouth is a straight line,
"I don't expect you to understand it Sam."</p>

<p>"Try me", she says immediately. And I should try,
shouldn't I? Cause she deserves to know. And I feel bad everytime
I hurt her by not letting her help me.</p>

<p>I sigh and start to think of a way to explain it. It's hard cause
I don't know if I understand it myself even, "Do you remember
the first day we went back to school?", she nods. And I see the
hope float back into her, when she realizes I'm gona share some
of my secrets. Talk about mood swings. She's gona be a wreck when
the day's over. The day is over, it's almost eleven already,
"I saw the way your friends were consoling you. They were there
the minute you stepped into the school, and they cared. Your friends
love you Sam", she isn't following my train of thought.
Now's the time to stop, if I don't want her to know. But
I'm not gona stop, she wants hear it. Who knows, maybe it does
some good for her, "And I realized that with my dad gone, there
isn't a single soul in this world who truly loves me. And
everybody needs love, Sam. Because being without it hurts like hell.
For a while, and then when the hurt is gone, there isn't anything
left."</p>

<p>At first she just looks at me. Looks real hard, "Brooke
that's just...", she flings her hands in the air, spins
around and takes a couple of steps towards my bed, stops and turns
around to face me again, "And you look to your MOTHER for love?
She abandoned you!", yeah, thanks for pointing THAT out. Like I
wasn't painfully aware of it already, "Besides", she goes
on and takes a step forward, "You have people who love you.
There's Josh and..."</p>

<p>"If you say Nicole, I'm gona slap you silly", I cut her
in mid-sentence. Slowly she closes her mouth, "First of all, you
said you had a brain. So you should be able to separate Josh's
puppy-crush from the real thing. And secondly, I'd appreciate it
if you would just shut up about my mother. I know what she's
done."</p>

<p>She opens her mouth and I just know she's gona bash my mother
some more. But nothing comes out. At first. There's like ten
seconds before she speaks, "But you and Josh were together like
so long. Sure he had feelings for you?"</p>

<p>"Look, enough with Josh. The guy makes me sick", I say and
mean it. I've had enough of him for a lifetime. That's what I
told him in the cafeteria that first day we went back. Maybe not in
those very words.</p>

<p>It's like, all morning he just keeps pestering me, `Are you
okay Brooke? Do you nead anything? How do you feel?' And I tell
him over and over again that I'm fine. Just give me some room to
breathe. But no, he just doesn't get it. Finally at lunch
I've had enough.</p>

<p>`Do you want some more milk, Brooke?',<br/>
`No.'<br/>
`How about water?'<br/>
`No.'<br/>
`Any..'</p>

<p>That's when I jump up and yell, `Jesus Christ! Can't you
just leave me the fuck alone?', and storm out. He tries to patch
up things the next day, but I won't listen.</p>

<p>
"You know I wasn't gona say Nicole", once again Sam pulls
me back to reality. It's like the manyeth time during these past
days. It takes me a while to replay our previous conversation in my
head, and to pick the right spot, "You know, when I said you have
people who love you", she helps me when she sees I'm having
trouble grasping her meaning.</p>

<p>"Oh... okay", so what?</p>

<p>"I was gona say me", oh that's what. Sam's voice is a
little tense. Like she is forcing herself to say the things, "I
care about you Brooke."</p>

<p>"Yes, well", I answer her, "There's a difference
between care and love. Lots of people care about me. Like aunt
Jessica."</p>

<p>"Fine. I love you then", she blurts out just like that. Not
very convincing. And there's still that tension in the voice.
She's just telling me what she thinks I want to hear.</p>

<p>"Really sweet of you, Sam. But you can't just say it and make
it so."</p>

<p>"I really, really do love you Brooke. You have to know that",
I look at her skeptically and she notices it, "You think I enjoy
the time I spend here trying to get you to live again?", amazing
how easily we revert back to our old habits. This banter is just like
the one's we used to have before the accident, "Well, I
don't. I do it because I love you."</p>

<p>The conversation has probably gone on longer than all my other
one's from the past two days put together. And I'm growing
tired. And Sam won't end it. Cause she's making such
progress. So it's up to me, "Okay. Could you do it another
time maybe? I'd like to get some sleep."</p>

<p>"Just say you believe me. And I'll go."</p>

<p>But I don't believe you. You have this weird look in your eyes
everytime you say it. You are just lying to get your way, "I
believe you", just like I'm lying to get mine.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 5">
<p>Sam wants me to go to school with her. She says it's for my own
good. But I can't. Not today. What if she calls and I'm not
here?</p>

<p>"What if she calls and you are here?", Sam says. I shrug,
"Besides, do you really think she won't call again if no one
answers?"</p>

<p>How should I know?, "Sam, I won't leave the house. You are
wasting your time."</p>

<p>Sam's not happy. I'm not happy. No one is happy. But
that's just the way it is. I would like to make her happy.
Because, if I realized one thing last night, it's that Sam is
just about the best human being I've ever known. She deserves
better than what I'm giving. She deserves better than what the
world is giving her. But life isn't fair, you just take
what's in your reach and make it matter. Or you lie down and wait
for it all to end.</p>

<p>Finally Sam gives up and leaves. She's frustrated that after last
night I've reverted back to the zombie-state. Well, I'm not
that bad anymore. I actually answered some of her questions. I ate
breakfast. And I almost jumped through the roof when the phone rang.
But I'm sure Sam was hoping for a full recovery after last night.
She's not the patient type. Sure she'll keep at it until she
gets what she wants, but she's always pressing for quick results.</p>

<p>I spend the day watching tv, lying by the pool and reading. Three of
my favorite waste of times. The phone rings three times, none of them
are her. One of the calls is for me though. It's from school,
they want to know if I'm okay. Isn't that sweet. I'm fine,
just a little feverish. I'll be in school tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Saturday? I'll be in Monday then. Bye. Thanks for
caring.</p>

<p>Jessica comes home around two. I have no idea where she's been. I
didn't even know she ever left the house, "Has she called
then?", I shake my head. She nods, "Mark said it could be a
few days before he hears from her."</p>

<p>Mark?, "Who is this Mark anyway?"</p>

<p>"Look, I know about as much as you do, Brooke. She just gave me
his number onetime and said that if I ever needed to reach her Mark
could help. She said that she calls him at least once a week", oh
great, "I've never even met him."</p>

<p>Okay.. this is so weird, "Why the hell is she so.. so..
why..", I have no words. I don't know how to say it. Why oh,
why has she never gotten in touch with me during these years? What
possible reason could there be?</p>

<p>Jessica sees me hurting and moves closer. She tries to enwrap me into
a hug, but I pull away, "Brooke..", she starts.</p>

<p>"Call him again", I say hiding behind the wall. I can't
show the hurt. It's private. Jessica opens her mouth to protest,
but I'm having none of that, "Call. Him. Again", I use my
ice cold stare to strengthen the words.</p>

<p>And it works again. She takes the phone from the table and dials. I
don't remove my eyes from her for a second. I don't even
blink, "I don't know what you hope to gain by this
Brooke", she says after a few seconds. I don't answer. I
don't have an answer.</p>

<p>Another ten seconds goes by before finally someone picks up,
"Yeah hi", Jessica says, "It's Jessica, Sarah's
sister. Yes, I called yesterday, but... what?", she glances at me
and then turns away, "I don't think... no. Yes, I'm sure.
Look could you just give me a number where I can reach her?",
Jessica raises her hand and brushes it through her hair once,
"Fine. I said fine. Bye."</p>

<p>She knows. She called him and now she knows. She knows and she just
doesn't care, "She had called him already, right?",
Jessica turns to look at me and hesitates. She's trying to decide
whether to lie or not, "Oh my god! She called."</p>

<p>"Brooke, don't read too much into this", Jessica says. I
hardly even hear her. Things are jumping around in my head,
"Maybe she's just gathering up her nerve. It's not easy
to make such a call after all this time."</p>

<p>Yeah right. And if I know my mother at all she's gona take the
easy way out and not call, "She's not gona call", I say.
But it feels like someone else is talking and I'm just listening
to her, "She knows dad is dead. She knows I'm all alone and
she's not even gona call."</p>

<p>"You don't know that Brooke", Jessica tries to delay the
inevitable. She has to know her sister well enough to know that she
won't call, "And even if she doesn't, you're not
alone. You have me Brooke. And you have Sam", and there comes the
preparation for the inevitable. So it won't hit so hard when it
finally strikes.</p>

<p>She advances towards me again ready to give me a comforting hug.
Again. And again I step away, "Please save your `I love you
Brooke' speech. I already got it from Sam last night", I spit
out in a bitter voice. I don't mean to, but I'm hurting,
"It's funny how you only tell me it as a last resort. Somehow
that eats away all it's credibility."</p>

<p>She shuts up. Half a minute goes by and I turn to leave. I have to
lie down or I'll faint. When I'm almost out of the room my
aunts voice reaches me once more, "Even if you don't believe
me, you should believe Sam. Why would she have stuck around here if
she didn't love you? There's nothing else in here for
her."</p>

<p>I push the words out of my mind. Don't need them messing around
in there, the place is in ruins as it is. They leave without putting
up much of a fight. But they are clever words, they leave behind this
trace. This thought. And the thought is much more effective than the
words could've ever been. The thought grows slowly. And
there's no way to get rid of it. It's like a parasite, it
feeds on my mind. So I do the only thing I can. I bury it under an
even bigger thought.</p>

<p>My mother. My EVIL mother. How could she do it? How could she leave
me? How could she go on for eight years without so much as a card?
And now the biggest insult of all, how can she NOT even call after I
lost my father? It just hurts so much. It hurts even more than losing
dad. And that's a lot. That's more than my little heart can
take. It's beating on overdrive, and if I don't calm down soon
it's gona break. I'm gona die of a heart attack at the age of
seventeen! I know I am. Everything goes black, and I know I'm
gona die. My feet give out from under me, and I know I'm gona
die. I hit my head into something hard. And I know I'm gona die.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 6">
<p>I wake up with a fierce headache. I wake up because of the fierce
headache. I wake up and the first thing I see is Sam staring intently
at me. I'm lying in my bed on my left side, and she's sitting
in my chair right in front of me. She sees the exact moment I wake
up, the exact moment I open my eyes. And she smiles. I don't
smile back. She doesn't expect me to.</p>

<p>Instead I try to remember what it was that put me in here. A big
mistake. The memory shoots through my mind in such a massive pain
wave that I wince in agony.</p>

<p>"Oh hey, do I look that bad?", Sam tries to kid her way onto
my good side again. And fails again. I'm not that big on jokes.</p>

<p>I roll onto my back and press my right hand on my forehead, "I
have a killer headache."</p>

<p>"Figured that much. You also have a killer bump a little to the
left", Sam says, and I move my hand and feel it out. It isn't
that big, there's a sore spot but I'd hardly call it a bump,
"There's some pills and water on the night table."</p>

<p>Thank you Sam. I sit up with a groan and pick up the three pills on
the table, "Didn't dare to leave the whole jar in case
I'd gulp them all?", I say and drown the pills with some
water.</p>

<p>"You need more?", she says not the least bit hurt. Why is she
so calm?</p>

<p>I shake my head and turn to look at her again. She's still
staring straight at me. Straight into me. And the thought I tried to
bury, the thought my aunt planted, surfaces again. The thought of Sam
loving me.. why is it so hard to believe it?</p>

<p>"What happened?", Sam asks all of a sudden.</p>

<p>I shrug and turn away, "I fainted. It was really hot today. And I
guess I laid in the sun too long", good lie Brookie. She'll
fall for that one for sure.</p>

<p>"Riiiight.. funny thing that sun. Never know when you've had
enough", she says, and I nod.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because of our history. How can I believe her when
she's spent the last six months hating me, fighting with me? But
then there's that old saying, it's a thin line between love
and hate. Of course that is always used in reference to...
romantic... love...</p>

<p>Slowly I turn back and still she's drilling a hole into my head
with those brown eyes. It can't be so. I must've really hit my
head hard. It can't be so, "Saaam...?", I drag the name
too long.</p>

<p>"What?", she asks. And for the first time since I woke up she
looses her cool. For the first time she can't see what I'm
aiming at. I stare at her my mouth open. It can't be so, "What
Brooke?", she's getting impatient. Even worried, "Are you
all right? Does it hurt somewhere else?", she says and stands up.</p>

<p>I still don't get a word out. All these moments from the past,
our past, are parading around in my head. And I look for a hidden
meaning behind every word Sam has ever said to me, behind her every
action. There were those millions of times I caught her staring at
me. I always figured it was just... just what? Her looks were never
hateful, well sometimes they were, but not every time. Sometimes they
were just curious. And intense. Always intense.</p>

<p>Sam's hand lands on my face and distracts my thoughts. She's
feeling out the bump, "Brooke? Say something. Are you all
right?"</p>

<p>I jerk back my head and Sam immediately does the same to her
hand, "Yeah. Never better", I say returning my eyes to her.
Sam's feeling uncomfortable, squirming about, and finally she
takes a couple of steps backwards. Oh god, what if it is so?</p>

<p>"Are you sure?", the tension keeps on rising.</p>

<p>I nod, "How long was I out anyway?", maybe if we do the inane
conversation thing, thing's will easy up.</p>

<p>"About three hours", Sam says, "Maybe we should go see a
doctor, you know just in case?"</p>

<p>We?, "We?", okay what's that about?</p>

<p>Sam frowns, "Yeah. We, as in you and me", she says,
"It's a pronoun."</p>

<p>"So it is", I force a smirk on my face, it is after all
expected, "Well, we is fine. Just a little sleepy still."</p>

<p>Sam hovers there for a moment longer and then sighs and turns to
leave, "Okay, holler if you need anything."</p>

<p>After Sam's gone I lie back down. More confused than ever.
Strangely enough I feel a little better. As long as I can just keep
my mother out of my head, everything'll be all right. This Sam
stuff is way effective in that respect. But it won't hold for
long now that she herself is gone. And for the first time since the
accident I find myself wishing I wasn't alone. Because, already I
can feel mom edging her way in. She's waiting behind the wall. And
maybe I should let her in. Maybe she can explain. She's good with
explanations.</p>

<p>Sam's pills are making me woozy. I think I will sleep for a
little while longer. Dream the good dream.</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>The funny thing about Sam's room is, that it's so much cozier
than mine. Mine is cold, feels like no one lives there. But Sam's
room is cute and comfortable. And I don't know why that is.
It's nothing material, I know that much. If you just compare the
stuff in her room, and in my room, there's not much of a
difference. So it must be something that doesn't reveal itself to
the naked eye. It must be something out of this world. Maybe it's
Sam herself. Maybe she makes people feel welcome around her. And
maybe that reflects itself into the room. The same way I seem to
repel people, so my room naturally does too. Whatever it is, it is.
And it can't be helped.</p>

<p>Besides, that's just stuff. This is real. I'm standing in her
room in the middle of the night. All fussed up. I have my make up on
and I even washed my hair. It smells appleish. And I'm dressed in
one of my silky nightgowns. The goldish one I tried to seduce Josh
with. What a waste of time that was. This won't be. This
can't be.</p>

<p>Sam is still sleeping. She'll wake up soon though, she has to.
And I can wait. I have to wait. Because I have to know. I have to
feel it. I have to feel her love. I'll take it in any shape, in
any form she's willing to offer it. I'm desperate for it.</p>

<p>When I woke up an hour ago, I realized why I've been sleeping my
nights so well. It's because at night, in the dark, the
loneliness pushes on stronger than ever. It consumes everything, and
sleep is the only escape. But tonight it didn't work. I
couldn't sleep. And when I couldn't sleep I started to make
up all this stuff in my head. Stuff about my mother, stuff that
hurts, stuff that I need to get rid off. And the only way to do that
is through Sam... please open your eyes Sam! Pretty please...</p>

<p>And she does, "Brooke..?", she says with a sleepy voice and
sits up.</p>

<p>"Shhh..", I hush her and close the distance between us.
Quickly so she doesn't have time to think.</p>

<p>"But wha..", is the only thing she gets out before I cover
her mouth with mine. I try to make the kiss passionate, but it feels
only desperate. It takes Sam so completely by surprise though, that
she doesn't notice the difference. She just goes with it. She goes
with it when I push my tongue into her mouth, she goes with it when I
slowly press her back down onto the bed, "Brooke. Wait", she
manages to pant out when our kiss ends.</p>

<p>"No talk", I answer very sure of myself. I can't give her
one second to think. She'll end this for sure. That is why I lie
down on top of her and press our lips together again. One of my hands
is buried in her hair, and the other one slides carefully under her
pajama top. Every move I make is planned ahead. An hour is a long
time, and while my body was making itself presentable, my mind was
plotting on the best approach. Cause this has to be done just right.
Sam's not stupid, she'll notice the smallest mistake I make.
When my hand reaches her left breast and starts to caress it, I
slowly release her mouth and move down. She makes a soft moan when I
start kissing her neck. I remove my right hand from her hair and
place it on her mouth. She immediately starts kissing it and licking
it and nibbling on it.</p>

<p>It goes on for a time and I can feel Sam's lust growing. Her
actions become more and more aggressive, her hands are roaming around
my body and her mouth starts to look for mine again. I am not exactly
sure at which point it happens, but somewhere along the line our
roles change. Sam becomes the aggressor and I let her do whatever she
wants. Just like I planned. I let her roll us over so she's on
top. I let her lift my nightgown up, I let her hands go where-ever
they please. I let her make love to me. Just like I planned...</p>

<p>Only not. I don't feel the pleasure I thought I would. I only
feel the desperation. I only feel the need. I push myself harder
against Sam in hopes of achieving something pure out of this. But it
doesn't work. When I finally reach the climax, I don't cry
out from pleasure like I thought I would. I only moan a sigh of
relief into her shoulder. I don't feel loved like I thought I
would. I only feel like shit for using Sam. Using her true feelings
for my own selfish goals.</p>

<p>Sam rolls off of me and starts stroking my hair. I can't look at
her. Oh my god, what have I done? What have I DONE?,
"Brooke?", she says when I just lie there still as a corpse.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry", I mumble under my breathe and try to stand
up.</p>

<p>Sam doesn't let me. She grabs my hand and holds onto it,
"What?", she is totally confused. I've hurt her worse
than I could've ever even dreamed of. She just doesn't know
it yet, "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Please Sam. Let's..", let's what? Let's pretend
like it never happened? I take a quick glance at her. The expression
on her face is filled with hope. She looks so precious. I can't
shatter it, not now, "We'll talk in the morning, okay?",
I flash her a smile. It's a sad smile I know, but she doesn't
see it. She sees everything in roses.</p>

<p>"Okay", she nods and smiles back. And at that moment I could
swear I feel loved. And I could swear I love her. But it's only a
brief moment in time and it passes by so fast.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 7">
<p>Saturday. The weekend. Days just don't have the same meaning
anymore. Saturday feels the same as any weekday. Of course a lot of
that has to do with the fact, that I haven't been in school for
two days. I kinda would've liked to go today though. Could've
avoided that whole scene that's bound to play out when Sam
catches up with me. Well, hanging out at the mall isn't that bad
either. Get to see what's new in designer fashion.</p>

<p>What if I just say that it was a mistake? She'll understand that.
Of course she'll be a little hurt, but she'll get over it. Or
I could say I'm not ready for a serious... yeah right. I was high
on the drugs she gave me, couldn't think straight? I don't
even remember it? I did WHAT?! God.. maybe I could get myself
committed to a mental institution.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well", a frighteningly familiar voice surprises
me when I'm pretending to check out a used record stand,
"Brooke McQueen. Fancy meeting you here. I was sure you
would've slit your wrists by now."</p>

<p>I turn and find myself face to face with Nicole. Should've known
better than to try and hide in a mall, "Not yet", I answer
and turn back to the stand, "I'll be sure to let you know
when I do though."</p>

<p>She chuckles and steps beside me, "Haven't seen you in school
lately. What's up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know. Couldn't decide what to wear."</p>

<p>She's silent for a second and I pick up a cd at random, "So
you went with jeans and a tee-shirt?"</p>

<p>What on earth does she want? If it's just to gloat over my
misery, why does she bother with the idle comments, "Can't go
wrong with jeans, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes you can", I almost grin, have to really fight to keep my
face straight. There's a reason I always overlooked Nicole's
evil tendencies. And the reason is she could always make me laugh
with her straight forward attitude, "And you already have that cd
so you can stop pretending you're interested in it."</p>

<p>I take a better look at the cover. Suzanne Vega. Hmph, what are the
odds. I own maybe twenty cds and of course I pick out a one that I
already have, "What do you want Nicole?"</p>

<p>"I wanna know what I did", she says immediately.</p>

<p>I turn and frown, "What you did? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"What I did that made you decide I'm not worthy of your
friendship anymore."</p>

<p>"I don't remember deciding anything like that", I answer
and take a step back.</p>

<p>"Then how come you haven't talked to me in a week?", is
that hurt I here in Nicole's voice? Can't be.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you make much of an effort to talk to me
either", I answer after a moments thought. I still don't get
what she's going at.</p>

<p>"It's not my style. You know that", she says,
"Besides, Josh made an effort, and look where it got him", I
don't answer. My mind is starting to spin again. I get all
confused, "Admit it Brooke, no matter what we did, you had
already made your choice."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. How insensitive of me not to think how MY
dad's death might affect the lives of my friends", why am I
arguing with her? I don't argue anymore. Ever. But something
about Nicole is unsettling. She's different from everything else.
She is like...</p>

<p>I take a few more steps away from her, "Where are you
going?", she asks confused herself.</p>

<p>"I... I'm just...", I turn a full circle and look for
something, anything familiar. And the only thing I find is Nicole.
She's the same as before the accident. She's the only thing
that is the same. Everything else has changed. She's the same, but
I've just found new qualities in her. I've just found out she
really wanted me as a friend. So in a way even she has changed. I
wish she hadn't. I wish she was the same. I wish something was
the same.</p>

<p>"Brooke?", Nicole asks again.</p>

<p>I take another step away, "Hey!", a male voice shouts behind
Nicole. It's a twenty something guy behind a counter, "You
planning on paying for that?", he is pointing at me.</p>

<p>And I frown. What the hell is he talking about? I shake my head a
little, "No", I say for some reason. Don't know why. And
then I turn around for the last time and walk away.</p>

<p>"Hey you!", comes the male voice again, and after that
Nicole's voice. I can't make out what she's saying, the
words are not loud enough.</p>

<p>I make it to the escalator that leads down to the exit when a hand
grabs my shoulder and spins me around. It's Nicole again.
She's not giving up. In some ways she's very much like Sam.
And then in other ways she's so nothing like Sam.</p>

<p>"What are you doing McQueen?"</p>

<p>"I'm...", what am I doing?, "Going home."</p>

<p>She grabs my left wrist and lifts my hand in front of my face.
It's still holding that Suzanne Vega cd, "These things are
not free Brooke. I just saved you a trip to the security guard's
office."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah", thanks a bunch, "I should probably return
it."</p>

<p>"Keep it, I already paid for it", she says and I keep staring
at the cd. Finally she releases her grip, "You know there's
something definitely wrong with you Brooke."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know", I answer glancing at her, "I've
become an awful person Nic. And I can't change."</p>

<p>"What do you mean awful?"</p>

<p>I open my mouth to tell her. And then I close it so as not to tell
her. And then I shake my head, "Nothing. I gotta go. Sam's
waiting me in the car", okay, who said that? I can't believe
the things that come out of my mouth.</p>

<p>"You and Sam getting along?", Nicole sounds skeptic. No, she
sounds worried.</p>

<p>Why am I hurting her intentionally?, "Oh yeah, we're best
friends now", and why am I lying?!</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>I arrive home, and it's only midday.  The avoidance game is not
working that well. It's all the same. I've gotta face her
sooner or later. It was stupid of me to sneak out in the morning in
the first place. But somehow taking the easy way out comes so
naturally now. It's in my genes. Like mother, like daughter.</p>

<p>Just hope Sam's not too angry... whose suitcase is that? It's
lying in the hallway, and I'm sure it wasn't there in the
morning. It can't be Sam's? Could she be that upset? A flash
of pain rushes through me. What if she's leaving? It would serve
me right, but I can't believe how much even the thought of that
hurts.</p>

<p>"Sam?!", I yell and start to ascend the stairs. No answer. I
take a few steps and shout again, "Sam!"</p>

<p>"What is it Brooke?", her voice surprises me from behind. I
spin around and find her standing in the living room doorway.</p>

<p>Thank God she isn't gone yet, "Sam, I'm sorry I
wasn't here in the morning..."</p>

<p>"Brooke...", she cuts me short.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I..."</p>

<p>"Your mother is here Brooke."</p>

<p>Stop interrupting me! I've gotta say... "I... huh... you...
What?", I finally stutter out and almost fall down the stairs,
"I mean... what?", she didn't just say what I heard. She
did not say it.</p>

<p>"She came an hour ago", she said it.</p>

<p>I stare at her dumbfounded. I just stare at her for ten seconds while
my mind is catching up with the rest of the world. No awkward
conversation with Sam today. That's been delayed. Instead
I'll be getting my heart ripped out once more by my mother.
Because inside me this feeling of such great hope is surging it's
way up. I'm setting myself up for another big disappointment. And
I can't help it. Cause she's my mother. And I hate my mother.
And I love her. Cause she's my mother.</p>

<p>"And she's here? As in this house?", Sam nods. How can
she be so calm? Didn't I just turn her world upside down last
night? And now this?, "And that's her suitcase..", she
nods again, "Full of stuff that belongs to her."</p>

<p>"She's in the living room right now."</p>

<p>"But... I can't...", what do I say to her?, "I
mean... this is too much...", should I drive her out of the
house? Scream at her, ask for explanations, hug her, slap her, "I
don't know what to say to her."</p>

<p>I'm totally scared. And I'm pleading for Sam to help me.
I'm  pleading for her to make things right. I'm pleading for
her with my eyes. And she does her best. Like always, "Brooke,
just relax", she gives me an encouraging smile, "You don't
have to say anything, or do anything. Just come see her", she
nods a little and keeps smiling, "And I guarantee she's more
nervous than you."</p>

<p>Slowly I walk down the few steps and take a hold of Sam's hand
when she offers it. It feels so warm, so good against my cold one.
The doorway is only a few feet away from us. And then I remember my
spying session from a couple of days back. I sat on the steps and
heard everything Sam and my aunt said in the living room. So that
means she probably heard everything we just said. It doesn't
matter. Just go in already! Move you stupid feet! I look down at
them. Why doesn't anything in my body work properly?</p>

<p>Sam takes the first step and pulls me into motion along with her. I
take one step and my aunt comes to view. She's looking in my
direction and smiles. I take another step and the rest of the room
opens up. And I see her. For the first time in eight years I see her.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 8">
<p>She has changed. She's not an angel anymore. Her hair is slightly
darker and shorter and on ponytail, and her face is slightly thinner.
It's too thin. She looks tired, she looks sick. Her whole
appearance is worn out. And she's wearing an old blue dress with
lots of different flowers in it. I remember that dress from my
childhood. But I don't remember this woman.</p>

<p>She stands up quickly when I step into the room. And boy was Sam
right, she is so much more nervous than me. It's almost like her
whole body is shaking. And there's a smile on her face, only it
looks more like she's crying. She opens her mouth to talk, but it
takes a long time before she says anything, "H.. hi Brooke",
the words barely manage to carry over the room. She waves her hand as
she talks. And it trembles worse than anything I've ever seen.</p>

<p>Sam has stopped, and so have I. We're standing fifteen feet
apart. It's my turn. My move. I can either ease her suffering a
little, or I can make it worse. And even though this sadistic part of
me wants to make her feel like shit, I won't do it. I won't,
"You came", I say and watch as she tries to nod. It seems
though, that she has even more trouble controlling her body than I
have mine, "Why?"</p>

<p>She takes a deep breath and seems to calm down a bit, "Be.. cause
you asked."</p>

<p>"No I didn't", I say before I can stop myself. Don't
make it harder for her!</p>

<p>The crying-smile disappears and it's replaced by a blank
expression. A one she has practiced a lot, I can tell. It shows
nothing. No emotion. And it hides her natural beauty so well, no one
would ever give this woman a second glance. With a twinge of panic I
realize it's the same face I've been wearing for the past two
weeks. She keeps it on for some seconds, before trading it in for a
normal one. As normal as she can muster I guess, "That's
right... you didn't", she tries to smile again, and fails,
"And I'll leave if you want me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, how noble of you."</p>

<p>This time she takes the hit better. Only lowers her gaze for a
second. When she raises it again her eyes meet mine. And now I
recognize her. Because of the sadness in them, "I'm sorry
about your father Brooke", she says, and then adds quickly,
"A..and... Jane...", her look darts between me and Sam a
couple of times.</p>

<p>Like anyone cares for your condolences! I almost shout it out loud.
Almost. There's a lot of anger still in me. I thought I had let
go of it a long time ago. I mean she's here. And I wanted her
here.</p>

<p>"You want to sit down Brooke?", Jessica says when the silence
becomes a burden.</p>

<p>I just shrug and take a seat at the couch. Sam sits beside me, and
across the table my mother sits down on the armchair.</p>

<p>"I would..ve come before, but.. but I only heard from it...",
mom starts again.</p>

<p>But I don't let her finish, "That doesn't matter. What
matters is that it takes something like this for you to come see your
own daughter!", she looks away. She looks away and I see tears in
her eyes. Nearly a minute goes by and she doesn't answer,
"God! What is wrong with you?", I cry out in frustration.</p>

<p>She's still looking away, looking out of the window into our
backyard, "You've taken down the swing", what? Oh, the
swing. I loved the swing when I was a child. But I outgrew it, and
there was just no use for it anymore. There are times when I'd
still like to sit in it though, swing real fast, up and down, and
feel the wind. It's almost like flying, "You loved the swing.
You used to sit hours in it. Remember?"</p>

<p>Her head turns back and she's smiling again, "Don't",
I say to her shaking my head, "Don't go there", my
childhood is my own. She has no right to it. Not anymore.</p>

<p>"I live there Brooke."</p>

<p>What is she on? This woman is insane, "You live where?", I
say frowning.</p>

<p>"In the memories", she says still smiling. The shakes have
left her. She's not nervous anymore. How did that happen? When
did that happen?, "I live in your childhood. They are the only
happy memories I have."</p>

<p>Yeah. It was a blast, "Oh, sure. If you had such super fun time,
why'd you bail on us?", and why the hell am I listening to
you?</p>

<p>She glances to my left, where her sister is sitting. I wonder how
much she knows about it all. I wonder why I never had the nerve to
ask her anything. And I wonder why I'm praying that my mother can
answer my question.</p>

<p>"There is no reason that could ever justify it, I know that",
she says. At least she has the decency to look at me when she says
it, "All I have is a bunch of excuses. And I don't think you
want to hear them."</p>

<p>"And I don't know how you dare to make that assumption. You
don't know the first thing about me", I'm still talking
like I don't care, like she means nothing to me. But my mind
isn't buying it anymore. I guess deep down it's been waiting
for this all my life. Even if I could never forgive her, I still need
to be given that chance. It's my choice to make, and I have a
right to it.</p>

<p>Mom just stares at me. And I stare at her. It's almost a contest.
When she realizes that she backs down., "Well.. do you
want..", she looks at Sam and swallows, "Sam to hear it?"</p>

<p>The girl next to me shifts nervously. I can feel her hand brush
against mine. She's sitting real close to me. Do I want Sam to
hear it? No, I don't. Do I tell her that? She was real sweet in
the hallway, maybe she wouldn't mind waiting outside. I turn to
look at her. And she has turned to look at me. She would mind. Her
eyes are not as calm anymore. This time she's pleading for me.
This time I could do something for her. But why is she so keen on
staying?</p>

<p>"Brooke", Sam talks for the first time since we stepped into
the room, "Please tell your mother we have no secrets."</p>

<p>But we do have secrets. So many secrets. I press my head down,
"Maybe you could wait outside Sam?"</p>

<p>At first there's no reply. Then I feel her standing up, "Oh,
sure Brooke", her voice is so bitter I almost don't recognize
it, "Whatever you want Brooke. I'll just go stand by the
stairs till you need me again. Is that okay.. Brooke?"</p>

<p>I don't answer, I don't look up. I don't move a muscle. I
just wait for her to leave, "Sam, wait", my aunt finally
intercepts and rushes after her. I steal a quick glance over my
shoulder and see Sam just exiting the room. She's not stopping.
Jessica follows her a few steps behind leaving me alone. Alone with
my mother. I turn back and find her smiling at me. She smiles quite a
lot.</p>

<p>"This better be good then. I just hurt her pretty deep", I
say with a cold voice. How can she smile so much? I thought her life
was supposed to be shit.</p>

<p>"Go after her if you want to", she answers. And still smiles,
"I can wait."</p>

<p>"Just talk", Sam will be okay, nothing can keep her down. She
is the strongest person on this earth. Yeah.. she'll be okay.</p>

<p>She opens her mouth and is about to say something. A few seconds go
by and it seems she changes her mind and says something else,
"How much do you want to know?", the smile is finally gone.
Replaced by the initial apprehension. Somehow it makes me feel better.</p>

<p>"How about everything."</p>

<p>"Fine. Just remember I'm not trying to defend myself. You
wanted to hear it", she takes a deep breath and starts talking.
And it's like the words just fly out of her. Like they've been
trapped inside for too long, "You're not my first child
Brooke", oh good start mom! Exactly what I wanted to hear!,
"I had a baby boy at fifteen. Johnny. I raised him all alone for
two years. Until one day he got sick. And he got sicker. And then he
died. And even though the doctors said he was born with a bad heart,
that I couldn't have done anything, I knew it was my fault",
she talks with a surprisingly steady voice. I guess she has made her
peace with that stuff already. But I'm starting regret I asked
her. Should've known there was a sob story behind it. Isn't
there always?, "For the following year I shut myself down.
Nothing got in, nothing got out. I didn't even grieve for him, I
just shut out all feelings and went on living like a robot. And then
when I was eighteen I met your father. I met him at a time when I was
completely isolated from the world, completely alone. Desperate for
any kind of human contact, for anyone to love me", she goes on
and on. And I stare at her my mouth open. The words hit me with such
force I almost choke. How can she use those very words? How can she
know? How can we be so alike? But she's not looking at me and so
she doesn't see me gasping for air, "And it's not like I
didn't feel anything for him. I did love him in my own way I
think. But not enough. It wouldn't have lasted a year if I
hadn't gotten pregnant", she turns quickly to look at me and
sees my anguish. But she mistakes the reason for it, "Oh, I
didn't mean it like that Brooke! I was so happy the day you were
born!"</p>

<p>I close my eyes and shake off the gnarly feeling inside. Get a hold
of yourself Brookie! She's your mother, it's only natural you
deal the same way with the same stuff. Still.. it puts a new spin on
some things. But that's for later, "Yeah, don't
worry", I say when I open my eyes, "It's not like I
hadn't guessed already, that I was an unwanted bundle of joy."</p>

<p>"That's not true!", she says it loud. Too loud. Who gave
her the right to yell?, "I loved you from day one. And so did
Mike."</p>

<p>I settle for a glare. No point in arguing about something so
stupid, "Move. On."</p>

<p>She doesn't want to. She wants to argue. But she can't, cause
I get to call all the shots around here. So she gives up and
continues, "The few years after your birth were the happiest of
my life. I devoted them to you. And I got along with Mike quite well,
even though I hadn't loved him for a long time anymore", no
matter how much I'd like to think she's lying, I know she
isn't. My earliest memories are of my mother. I know she was
always there when I was a baby. But that's no comfort. It only
makes her betrayal hurt even more, "But you grew up. And needed
me less and less.."</p>

<p>"Grew up!", what the hell?!, "I was nine when you
left!"</p>

<p>I manage to scare her good. She almost jumps up from her seat,
"Like I said Brooke. They are only excuses", this time she
doesn't raise her voice. And she did say that, so just calm down,
"You were nine. And you had started your school a couple of years
back. I had all that time during the day and nothing to do with it.
So I started exploring the outside world. It was a place I had never
seen before, a whole different land with lots of pretty things, and
lots of different people. I started realizing all that I had missed.
I never got to just be me, free in the world , with no worries and no
responsibilities. I missed my whole youth and I wanted it back."</p>

<p>"And to hell with everything else, ha... mom?", I pour all my
self-pity into those words. I never liked the stuff anyways. It's
useless, and it's unattractive.</p>

<p>She looks happy when I call her mom. Even though I meant it as an
insult, "That was pretty much the gist of it. When I met Ray it
was all over. He had all these wild ideas about life, and how to live
it. And I so much wanted to be a part of it. Then when I ran away
with him, I just ran. I didn't think about anything, I just ran.
We got into a buss to New York. And you wouldn't believe the
feeling of freedom. It was such a rush to be sitting in that buss
knowing that I could go anywhere", she talks and I hear the
excitement in her voice, I see it in her face. And then she turns to
look at me and the glimmer in her eyes disappears, "Of course the
feeling subsided as soon as I came down from the clouds. It was
probably a month later when I called the first time, and hung up.
Then it was almost a  daily routine for about  two weeks, I dialed
the number and hung up after a couple of rings. Once or twice Mike
answered but I never got a word out. And every time it was harder to
pick up the receiver, until finally I gave up. Stopped trying."</p>

<p>I'm fine right until the last few sentences. But then slowly this
bad thing inside of me starts to grow. It's an overwhelming
feeling of pain. I don't want to cry in front of her. So I do the
only thing I can, I flee. I get up and I half walk, half run to the
door, "Brooke?", she calls after me. I barely hear it. I
thought I could take it, I thought that whatever she said it
couldn't be that bad. After all, I've gone through every
possible reason in my head. And hers was a pretty good one. I can
understand it, despite my biting comments and my mock hurt, I can
understand it. I can understand her leaving. It's not the reason
that pains me, it's not even the fact that she left.</p>

<p>It's that she wanted to come back. It's that she was SO close
to coming back, and then nothing. She just gives up. And as a result
we lost eight years. I lost eight years I was entitled to. Eight
years because she was too much of a coward to admit her mistake!
It's such a waste!</p>

<p>In the doorway I run straight into my aunt. She's coming in and
catches me by the shoulders when we collide, "Brooke? What's
wrong?", Jessica asks with a worried look about her. I try to
answer but it's not working, my mouth is not working. Instead I
look at her with my watery eyes. She looks back for a moment, and
then past me, at her sister. And her face hardens, "What did you
do?", she demands to know.</p>

<p>I don't hear the answer. If there even was one. I pull free from
Jessica's grasp and escape. Out the front door and away.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 9">
<p>The corner of  Greenway Drive and Park Avenue is so very close. A
walking distance from the house. The weird thing is, that it's so
scarcely trafficked. Especially late at night. I can't believe
the accident happened here. Dad and Jane had to be hit by the only
other car in a mile's distance. Of all the bad luck.</p>

<p>At three p.m. there's still some traffic here. I sit on a bench
at a bus stop and watch all the cars drive through the intersection.
I watch them wait at the lights, and then speed through. All of them.
There are no close calls. Not even a single one. I wonder if someone
has done a research on how many accidents happen here. And I wonder
where I could get my hands on such a research. I could go to the
library and scan through all the local papers, do my own study. That
sounds just so much fun. Too much.</p>

<p>A gray ford pulls into the stop. A loud base is pumping through the
open windows and a brunette girl of maybe thirteen steps out of the
front passenger door. She leans down and says something to the
driver. Then the car speeds of and I follow as it drives straight
through the green lights and takes a right turn on Greenway. Away
from the house. To the direction dad and Jane were coming from. I
keep turning my head around further and further, trying to follow
it's route until finally the car disappears behind a building.
Another one got through. What was it that made dad and Jane so
special? Why were they picked?</p>

<p>"That was my brother. Cool car, ha?", the thirteenish girl
surprises me. I fling my head back just as she sits next to me on the
bench. She's way upbeat, has an adorable smile on her face. I
smile back and nod my head once, "So where you headed?"</p>

<p>"To the city", I answer without thinking. My auto pilot seems
to be on lie-mode today. Well, the girl deserves it, who goes around
initiating conversations with strangers?</p>

<p>"Hey, me too!", she chirps and grins, "Don't you just
love LA?", I shrug, "Yeah I know, you've probably gotten
tired of it already, hey? Not me though", she goes on and takes a
quick glance down Park Avenue. Scouting for the bus, "I could
spend hours just walking the streets. And I can't wait till
I'm old enough to get into clubs and stuff", it's kinda
fun listening her talk. So carefree, "Hey, you wanna borrow a
tissue or something? Cause your eyes are", she says grimacing and
waving a finger at her own eyes, "kind of a mess, you know?"</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, I wept the whole way down here, "You carry around
tissues?", I ask eyeing her from head to toe. She's dressed
in blue jeans and a black sweater. I'm almost scared to think
where she might have hidden the tissues. Or in what condition they
are.</p>

<p>Again she grins, "Well, no. I just thought it was polite to
offer", I laugh out loud. She's great!, "But seriously,
you gotta do something to your eyes. They are all puffy and smudged
and wet and whatnot."</p>

<p>"Yeah", I say when I stop laughing. I still keep smiling
though, "I'm gona head for that gas station soon as I've
rested enough", I say and nod towards the building across the
street.</p>

<p>"But you'll miss the bus", she says a little confused.</p>

<p>I'll miss the bus. Damn! Suddenly getting on that bus seems so
appealing. Just get on that bus and go where-ever I want. You
wouldn't believe the feeling of freedom Brooke. Who said that? My
mother. Only some two hours ago. Seems much longer. Or shorter.
Depends on how long an hour usually feels. I don't remember
anymore.</p>

<p>"Here it comes already!", she says and jumps up. I look down
the road and sure enough there it is, "Come on, you can clean up
in LA, there are rest rooms there too. I don't wanna sit all by
myself in the bus."</p>

<p>I get up and walk to the curb behind her. I could just get in, and
leave. There's nothing for me here, nothing for me at home. I
turn and look across the intersection, towards the house. Of course I
can't see it, it's maybe a mile away. But I can picture it.
In all it's emptiness, and it's former queen who has returned
from exile. Nothing there. Nothing but... Sam, walking down the hill.
Towards me. Her head is spinning around until her eyes meet mine.
She's almost fifty yards away, but I can see her smile when she
recognizes me. What IS she made of? How can she forgive me everything
before I even get a chance to apologize?</p>

<p>I see her only for a second. Then the view is blocked by the
monstrous bus. I think I hear a faint voice calling me over the
rumbling sound of the engine. It's too distant to take into
notice though.</p>

<p>"Come", the girl is motioning for me to follow her inside.
She's grinning. I like her. A lot.</p>

<p>But not enough. I shake my head slightly, "Nah, I'll catch a
later bus."</p>

<p>"You sure?", she asks and I nod, "Okay, see ya", she
shrugs and flashes that adorable grin one more time, "I'm
Dana by the way."</p>

<p>"Brooke", I answer and smile. I really like her. I like her
cause she's got nothing to do with my life. I like her cause
she's the first thing that made me laugh, made me forget. Even if
it was only for a minute. I like her even though I know nothing about
her.</p>

<p>She disappears deeper into the depths of the metal thingy. I look
after her for a moment and then take a few steps back when the bus
leaves. So as to avoid the enormous fume clouds emitting from it. It
moves maybe two bus lengths before coming to an abrupt halt again.</p>

<p>"Wait!", I hear Sam's voice. She comes around from the
front of the bus and stops at the front door. She doesn't see me.
She must've run like crazy across the road to cut off the bus. The
driver opens the door and throws some curses at Sam. She isn't
impressed. Instead she hops inside.</p>

<p>Great. Now she's in the bus and I'm not. Why didn't I
just shout to her? God, why can't I do anything like a normal
person?! Slowly I start to make my way to the front door, all the
while trying to catch a glimpse from the inside. Ten seconds go by.
Fifteen. And nothing happens.</p>

<p>When I'm almost at door I hear her voice, "... the blonde
that got in from this stop?", she sounds annoyed.</p>

<p>"The blonde didn't get in", the driver is even more
annoyed. I see them now, through the open door. I see Sam's back,
and the side of her face when she's trying to look for me inside
the bus.</p>

<p>"No, but I saw her. She was standing.."</p>

<p>"The blonde did! not! get! in!", the middle-aged man shouts
from the top of his lungs. Sam almost falls out of the bus, onto her
back. The facts are just not registering into her head. She turns to
stare at the driver.</p>

<p>"Sam?", I ask timidly, before the guy pulls out a gun and
shoots her.</p>

<p>She turns around still in a state of daze, "Brooke? You
didn't get in?", she frowns.</p>

<p>I shake my head a little, "All good?", the driver is
glowering behind her, "Good. Now get out!", he answers his
own question.</p>

<p>Sam takes a quick glance over her shoulder and then steps back out.
The door closes right behind her and the bus leaves again. She's
standing only a few steps away from me. I can see the relief in her
features, "Why are you here Brooke?", she asks taking a step
closer. But still afraid to come too close. She must think I'm
some kind of a wild animal, that'll run if provoked.</p>

<p>"Why are you?", I ask back.</p>

<p>She smiles and shrugs, "Jessica said you ran out. I had to come
look for you."</p>

<p>"But why?", I ask again and bow my head. A few stray hairs
fall from their place and hang annoyingly on my face, "I'll
only hurt you more and more."</p>

<p>It takes a moment for her to answer, "You still don't
know?", her hand comes from out of nowhere and brushes away the
few rebel hairs. It puts them back in their place, and then rests on
my cheek for a while before pulling away, "How much I love
you?"</p>

<p>Maybe I do know. Maybe it's bad that I know. Cause I'll only
abuse that love, use it and then discard it. Use you, and then dump
you, "How can you love me so much, when I'm such utter
garbage? I don't deserve you, and I definitely don't deserve
your love."</p>

<p>"You're not garbage. You are just a girl trying to survive a
bad situation."</p>

<p>She takes another step closer. But I push her away, "Don't
Sam. I'll only hurt you again and again", I say and look at
her.</p>

<p>"And I'll still love you", she's pretending to have
all the answers again. She's so sure of herself, I really have no
way of competing with her. Might as well give up now, and see how
much she means what she says.</p>

<p>I'll give it one more shot. Give her one more chance to back
away, "Don't you even care if I love you back or not?",
that shuts her up. She wasn't expecting it. I can hurt her again
if I want to. And after this strike she won't be coming back for
more, "See Sam? See how easy it is for me? I have no little voice
inside that's telling me to stop."</p>

<p>We stare at each other for a good half a minute. I wait for her to
break down. She doesn't, she's too strong. But she does hurt,
she can't hide that. She gets angry when she hurts. And when she
gets angry she loses control, and that's when I can see it.
That's when I see the pain and the suffering she keeps inside.
She hides them as well as I hide mine, but when she's angry I can
see it.</p>

<p>"Good for you Brooke. Maybe you're right then", she says
and starts to walk away, "Enjoy the rest of your life. At least
you have you're mother now to share it with."</p>

<p>I can't let her have the last word. That's the way we always
end things, and she always comes back. So I start after her,
"Yeah, me and my mother. We are so much alike, it's
scary."</p>

<p>We cross the road. Sam's heading for the house. She's walking
so fast I have to scurry to keep up, "You really aren't
Brooke", she says shaking her head slightly, "At least your
mother has a heart. At least she doesn't intentionally go around
hurting people just to prove what a bitch she is."</p>

<p>"What?", why did she say that? How could she say that? She
hates my mother, she knows what my mother has done. I stop
walking, "You didn't mean that."</p>

<p>Sam stops too. She has an evil grin on her face, "Oh, I
didn't hurt your feelings, did I, Brookie?"</p>

<p>"You hate my mother. You have to hate her."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because", I say and try to think of a reason, "Because
she's my mother. She's the reason everything sucks. The
reason I am this way."</p>

<p>Sam's face softens a touch, "That's just stupid Brooke.
You can't blame everything on her."</p>

<p>"No, I can! You didn't hear what she said", this is going
well Brooke. Only two minutes has passed and already you're
begging for Sam's help, "You didn't hear", I repeat
more quietly, "We are exactly alike. Every decision she's
made, I've made. Everything she's done, I've done", I
set out to drive her away, and instead I'm pulling her back.
Cause I can't live without her. I just can't.</p>

<p>She looks at me for the longest time. And again she forgives me. Even
when I don't ask for it. This isn't healthy. This is not the
way it's supposed to work, "Come on. You're overreacting.
Your life is your own, you make the decisions. Not her."</p>

<p>I want to cry again. But not out here, "But the things she
said", I plead with a pitiful voice, "The words she
used", it's no more than a whisper. I tap my head a couple of
times and nod, "They're from here. They are my thoughts, my
feelings."</p>

<p>Sam hesitates only for a second. When the first tear rolls out of my
eye she envelopes me into a powerful hug. I cry, I bury my face into
her hair and I cry. I don't wanna cry out here, but it's
okay. Cause Sam's here too. And she'll protect me,
"I'm sorry Sam", I whisper into her ear. At least I think
I do. Can't be sure if the words ever leave my mouth, "I do
love you", how could I not love her? How could anyone not love
her?</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 10">
<p>I let her stay. I mean she's my mother, and I love her, and I
want her here. She looks happy when I tell her she can stay. But the
sadness still stays with her. I don't think it ever leaves, I
think it's something she's accepted as a part of herself. I
hope I never have to do that. But sometimes it feels like I already
have.</p>

<p>The evening is uncomfortable, and it drags on slower than anything.
Sam asks her little things about her life. What do you do for money?
You're a waitress? That's hard work, isn't it? Where do
you live? Oh, Boston! Lot's of colleges. What? You take courses
in Boston University? That's great, I mean.. it is.. really great.
Don't you think so, Brooke?</p>

<p>And I smile, and I nod, in all the right places. But I say very
little. Mostly I just look at her, and I look at Sam, and it's a
weird conversation. Mom is trying real hard not to say anything
wrong, anything upsetting. And Sam.. I don't know what she's
trying to do. At first it looks like she's interrogating her but
gradually it starts to seem as if she is truly interested in what the
woman is saying. And I almost get the feeling like she's
interviewing her for an article.</p>

<p>Her story, fascinating as it may be, doesn't sit well with my
current state of mind. I try to follow it, but somehow I can't
stay focused. Things start to slip by me and I decide it's time to
excuse myself, "I think I'm gona take a shower and then go to
sleep", I say when an appropriate pause presents itself.</p>

<p>"Wait Brooke. I'll come with you", Sam says when I stand
up.</p>

<p>I look at her and frown a little, "You don't have to Sam."</p>

<p>"No, but I want to", she answers also standing up.</p>

<p>"You want to come to the shower with me?", I ask, shaking my
head a little. A quick glance at my mother tells me that she's
following our exchange with mild curiosity and confusion. I wonder
how she'd deal with me and Sam.. let's not even go there.
It's not like she has any say in anything.</p>

<p>"Well, no", Sam blushes, "But I wanted to talk to you
about something."</p>

<p>I bet. But I'm not sure I'm ready for that conversation,
"Can't it wait?"</p>

<p>"No, Brooke, it can't", she states and her voice is hard.
And that's that. I promised her I wouldn't hurt her anymore,
I wouldn't shut her out. She didn't ask for the promise, but I
made it. And now I wanna break it only four hours later. I was so
right about me. I can't do it. I can't deal with all this
stuff.</p>

<p>"Fine, can I shower first?", I sound irritated.</p>

<p>And Sam notices it, and she's not happy. But she let's it go,
"Of course", she says and sits back down.</p>

<p>"Good night Brooke", mom pipes up before I can make my exit.</p>

<p>I stop at the door for a second, "Night mom", it just leaves
my mouth so naturally. I don't plan to say it, it just comes out.
She is my mother. Might as well call her that.</p>

<p>I walk up to my room and start to undress. I try for some seconds to
pull off my shirt, but all strength seems to have left my body. I
give up and sit down on the bed and start to think about stuff.</p>

<p>I do love Sam. Like I told her. But all this other stuff, this life,
everything that it brings with it seems so hard. I don't know if
I can live up to Sam's expectations. I can't believe she loves
me so much. I can't believe how much she's given up,
sacrificed just for me. Just to be near me. And I can't believe I
wish she hadn't done all that. Our relationship is too
unbalanced. I have too much power over her. If only Sam had all the
power. If only Sam could make all the decisions for me. She's so
good at that. She always does the right thing, says the right words.</p>

<p>She comes into my room fifteen minutes later. I'm still sitting
on the bed in my jeans and my white tee-shirt, "What? No
shower?", she asks and takes the chair.</p>

<p>I shake my head, "No shower."</p>

<p>She shrugs. Doesn't seem too upset anymore, "What are you
gona do about your mother, Brooke?"</p>

<p>What? My mother? Who cares?, "What do you mean? I told her she
could stay."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but are you just gona keep ignoring her like just now,
downstairs?"</p>

<p>I glower at her. Why is she so obsessed with my mother all of a
sudden?, "Give me a fucking break!", I say too loud, and too
angrily. She didn't deserve it, "I saw her for the first time
in eight years today."</p>

<p>Sam backs down a bit. I get the feeling there's something else
behind it all, "Okay, fair enough", she says and leans back,
"Just.. try to see her as she is. Not as she was", is she
actually defending my mother?</p>

<p>"Is that what you wanted to talk about?", I ask putting an
end to the mother business. Who needs it?</p>

<p>She takes a deep breath, "No."</p>

<p>I wait for her to go on. Nothing, "Yeah and..?"</p>

<p>"Why are you so hostile?", Sam finally asks looking straight
at me.</p>

<p>My turn to sigh, "Sam, I'm really tired. If you don't
have anything earth-shattering to say, could it please wait?",
Sam looks sad. Real sad. And tired herself. It's been a long day.
It was a long last night. She probably didn't sleep at all after
my.. attack, "You look like you could use some rest yourself
Sam", I try with a more settling tone.</p>

<p>"I just.. need to know", she whispers. I barely hear it,
"Where you think this'll all lead?"</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen Sam more vulnerable. I hardly
even recognize her with the trembling hands and the faltering voice,
"I have no idea", I say. Why is she asking me? She's the
one with the answers, and the plans, "Honestly Sam. It's just
so much."</p>

<p>"But you'll try, right? Like you promised?", she keeps on
going. I really didn't want this now. I'm too tired, I'll
hurt her just to get rid of her. I know I will, "Like when you
said you loved me, you meant it? It wasn't just to ease the
pain?"</p>

<p>I sigh again. Deep, and bow my head. I try, real hard, and manage to
suppress the initial reaction. Manage to swallow the automated
response, "Yeah. I meant it", she starts breathing again. I
can hear her across the room, "But the thing is Sam, it might not
be enough."</p>

<p>"It's enough", she waits until I raise my head to look at
her again, and then stands up, "It's a start."</p>

<p>No, but wait Sam! I mean to say it out loud. But I don't. Instead
I watch her walk up to me, I watch her slightly brush my forehead
with her fingers. And I watch her smile, before leaving the room.
There's this thing I didn't tell you Sam. This thing that
keeps on gnawing and gnawing at my brain. This thing my mother
said, `I was eighteen when I met your father. I met him at a time
when I was completely isolated from the world, completely alone.
Desperate for any kind of human contact, for anyone to love me'.
How much do I identify with that. And how badly did that end. It's
almost like I'm reliving her life over.</p>

<p>That's stupid Brooke, you make your own choices. Sam said that.
Sam knows more than my mother. Besides, I've known Sam longer. I
knew her when everything was fine. And I think I loved her even then.
I just need to sleep away these bad feelings. Everything'll be
better in the morning.</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>
With Sunday morning comes rain. Rain is good, it washes away all the
dirt. I wake up from the steady sound of rain drops beating against
my window. I wake up feeling better than ever. It's only six in
the morning but I'm all slept out. Still, lying in the bed and
listening to the rain is one of the few small things I love doing. No
matter what mood I'm in. So I stay in bed and think back on last
night. It's a little hazy at first. I can't remember why I
was so cranky. Why I was so worried about all that stuff. It's
all so meaningless. If I love Sam and she loves me, then that's
that. Nothing else matters.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll go wake Sam up and tell her that. She'd be so
surprised, she'd be so happy. The thought of making Sam happy
fills my heart with all kinds of warm feelings. Maybe I'll go
make her some breakfast. Then she'd be even happier. And she
would see that I really love her, and then she wouldn't have to
ask anymore. Cause she would know.</p>

<p>I smile at my own ingenuousness, throw on a bathrobe and sneak
downstairs. Seems someone else has stolen my big idea. More
particularly my mother. She's hogged the kitchen before me.</p>

<p>I stop in the doorway so that she doesn't see me, and observe as
she slices a tomato. I only see her from the side but something about
her expression, her whole posture, takes my breath away. She looks so
concentrated on the task. On this mundane task. And she is herself,
she's not trying to explain things to me, she's not
apologizing, she's just a woman making breakfast. She stands
there and cuts the tomato, again and again, like any other person.
And at that moment I see inside of her. I see beyond what she is to
me, I see her as a whole. And I stop feeling angry at her, I stop
feeling sorry for her, and I just see her, as she is in the world.
Trying to live her life like anyone else. And even if I can't
forgive her today, or tomorrow, or this week, or this month, I know
that someday I can. Someday I'll be able to look her in the eyes
and smile, and I can say: I'm happy you're my mom, I
wouldn't trade you for anyone.</p>

<p>She raises her head a little and catches a glimpse of my reflection
from the window. Her knife hand twitches back a little and she
manages to cut her left thumb, "Aww.. shit!", she cries and
drops the knife, "Oh damn!"</p>

<p>I grab a paper towel and move closer, "Here let me help", she
turns and gawks at me like I had two heads. She's hiding the
injured finger inside her right palm, "Come on, mom. How bad is
it?", I go on when she just stands there.</p>

<p>Finally she startles out of it, "It's.. it's nothing
Brooke. Just a little cut", she answers and reveals the injured
finger.</p>

<p>The wound is not big, but it's bleeding pretty much,
"Okay", I say and take a hold of her hand. It's warm and
so soft, just like I remembered it, "I'll just..", I wrap
the towel around the thumb, and press it lightly.</p>

<p>"Brooke", she whispers and lifts her free hand to brush my
hair. It never reaches it's target though, just hovers above my
head.</p>

<p>I meet her gaze and she's crying. Silently, but the tears are
visible. I smile at her, "Still can't sleep when it
rains?"</p>

<p>She shakes her head and laughs through the tears. And slowly lowers
her hand back down. It's another secret thing we shared when I
was a child. Whenever it rained in the night she would come to my
room and we would sit on my bed and look out the window. It
didn't happen often, we live in California after all. How weird
is it then that it rains the first night she comes back.</p>

<p>She dries off her eyes, "So you want some breakfast? I managed to
make two sandwiches before cutting off my finger", she says and
pulls away her hand when I release it.</p>

<p>"Sure. Let me just get a band-aid for that", I answer.</p>

<p>We sit at the table and eat. Quietly, no talk. And it's the
closest I've felt to her since her return. Jessica comes down a
few minutes later and ruins the moment. When the chatter starts
mom's walls rise back up. She thinks carefully about everything
she says, and I always get the feeling she's not telling the whole
truth. And I don't like it. I leave quickly, before the
resentment has time to return. "I'll go wake Sam up", I
say remembering my original mission.</p>

<p>The two sisters both look at me for a moment and then nod. Something
in my aunts eyes tells me she knows more than she should. She knows a
lot. Maybe everything. Depends on how well Sam's been hiding her
feelings. But it doesn't matter. Jessica is great that way. She
doesn't judge, sometimes it seems she doesn't even care, but
that's not right. She cares, she just doesn't interfere
unless asked. Maybe she wouldn't make a good parent, but she sure
is a great aunt.</p>

<p>Sam is already awake. Her door is open and she's brushing her
hair in front of the mirror, "Hey", she says when I enter the
room.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself", I answer her and stop in the middle of the
room.</p>

<p>Sam turns around in her chair and smiles, "You look better."</p>

<p>"I am", I nod a couple of times, "I wanted to tell you
something."</p>

<p>"What?", Sam asks.</p>

<p>I bow my head and start rubbing my hands together nervously. I have
no idea what's gona come out of my mouth. Maybe I should start
planning things a little better, "I'm pretty sure I love you
more than I'll ever love anything", I start and decide to say
everything that comes to my mind. I don't sensor, I just talk,
"And if you love me as much, and can forgive me every bad thing
I've done to you", I swallow hard, "And the ones that
I'll do in the future..", I raise my head up and startle a
little when I find Sam standing right in front of me. But the things
need to be said, "Cause I will hurt you again Sam. I know myself
too well", she opens her mouth to say something, but I'm
quicker, "And I know this good feeling that's inside me now,
will eventually pass, and that's when I'll hurt you. Cause
that's when I don't care about anything", she doesn't
believe me. But she'll learn, sooner or later. I can be one evil
chick when I'm in the mood, "So, if you can forgive me, then
I think I want to be with you. Always."</p>

<p>Sam only looks at me first and then grins, "Could you be a little
more dramatic Brooke?"</p>

<p>"It's not funny Sam. It's the way it is."</p>

<p>She keeps on grinning and then shrugs, "All right. You believe it
if you need to. And I promise to forgive you. Every time",
she's acting like nothing, "I guess we just have to make sure
you feel all good, all the time", it's a joke to her. Sam is
so strong, she's not afraid of anything. When she leans in and
hugs me, I hug her back, "You won't hurt me Brooke. As long
as you love me, nothing can hurt me", and maybe Sam is right, she
often is.</p>

<p>I look into the mirror and see Sam's back, and her brown hair
flowing free. I see my face, leaning on her shoulder. I see my blonde
hair mix with her brown. And it makes me feel good. It makes me feel
like I'm home. Where I belong.</p>
