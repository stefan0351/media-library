<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 7 -->

<p>Saturday. The weekend. Days just don't have the same meaning
anymore. Saturday feels the same as any weekday. Of course a lot of
that has to do with the fact, that I haven't been in school for
two days. I kinda would've liked to go today though. Could've
avoided that whole scene that's bound to play out when Sam
catches up with me. Well, hanging out at the mall isn't that bad
either. Get to see what's new in designer fashion.</p>

<p>What if I just say that it was a mistake? She'll understand that.
Of course she'll be a little hurt, but she'll get over it. Or
I could say I'm not ready for a serious... yeah right. I was high
on the drugs she gave me, couldn't think straight? I don't
even remember it? I did WHAT?! God.. maybe I could get myself
committed to a mental institution.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well", a frighteningly familiar voice surprises
me when I'm pretending to check out a used record stand,
"Brooke McQueen. Fancy meeting you here. I was sure you
would've slit your wrists by now."</p>

<p>I turn and find myself face to face with Nicole. Should've known
better than to try and hide in a mall, "Not yet", I answer
and turn back to the stand, "I'll be sure to let you know
when I do though."</p>

<p>She chuckles and steps beside me, "Haven't seen you in school
lately. What's up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know. Couldn't decide what to wear."</p>

<p>She's silent for a second and I pick up a cd at random, "So
you went with jeans and a tee-shirt?"</p>

<p>What on earth does she want? If it's just to gloat over my
misery, why does she bother with the idle comments, "Can't go
wrong with jeans, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes you can", I almost grin, have to really fight to keep my
face straight. There's a reason I always overlooked Nicole's
evil tendencies. And the reason is she could always make me laugh
with her straight forward attitude, "And you already have that cd
so you can stop pretending you're interested in it."</p>

<p>I take a better look at the cover. Suzanne Vega. Hmph, what are the
odds. I own maybe twenty cds and of course I pick out a one that I
already have, "What do you want Nicole?"</p>

<p>"I wanna know what I did", she says immediately.</p>

<p>I turn and frown, "What you did? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"What I did that made you decide I'm not worthy of your
friendship anymore."</p>

<p>"I don't remember deciding anything like that", I answer
and take a step back.</p>

<p>"Then how come you haven't talked to me in a week?", is
that hurt I here in Nicole's voice? Can't be.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you make much of an effort to talk to me
either", I answer after a moments thought. I still don't get
what she's going at.</p>

<p>"It's not my style. You know that", she says,
"Besides, Josh made an effort, and look where it got him", I
don't answer. My mind is starting to spin again. I get all
confused, "Admit it Brooke, no matter what we did, you had
already made your choice."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. How insensitive of me not to think how MY
dad's death might affect the lives of my friends", why am I
arguing with her? I don't argue anymore. Ever. But something
about Nicole is unsettling. She's different from everything else.
She is like...</p>

<p>I take a few more steps away from her, "Where are you
going?", she asks confused herself.</p>

<p>"I... I'm just...", I turn a full circle and look for
something, anything familiar. And the only thing I find is Nicole.
She's the same as before the accident. She's the only thing
that is the same. Everything else has changed. She's the same, but
I've just found new qualities in her. I've just found out she
really wanted me as a friend. So in a way even she has changed. I
wish she hadn't. I wish she was the same. I wish something was
the same.</p>

<p>"Brooke?", Nicole asks again.</p>

<p>I take another step away, "Hey!", a male voice shouts behind
Nicole. It's a twenty something guy behind a counter, "You
planning on paying for that?", he is pointing at me.</p>

<p>And I frown. What the hell is he talking about? I shake my head a
little, "No", I say for some reason. Don't know why. And
then I turn around for the last time and walk away.</p>

<p>"Hey you!", comes the male voice again, and after that
Nicole's voice. I can't make out what she's saying, the
words are not loud enough.</p>

<p>I make it to the escalator that leads down to the exit when a hand
grabs my shoulder and spins me around. It's Nicole again.
She's not giving up. In some ways she's very much like Sam.
And then in other ways she's so nothing like Sam.</p>

<p>"What are you doing McQueen?"</p>

<p>"I'm...", what am I doing?, "Going home."</p>

<p>She grabs my left wrist and lifts my hand in front of my face.
It's still holding that Suzanne Vega cd, "These things are
not free Brooke. I just saved you a trip to the security guard's
office."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah", thanks a bunch, "I should probably return
it."</p>

<p>"Keep it, I already paid for it", she says and I keep staring
at the cd. Finally she releases her grip, "You know there's
something definitely wrong with you Brooke."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know", I answer glancing at her, "I've
become an awful person Nic. And I can't change."</p>

<p>"What do you mean awful?"</p>

<p>I open my mouth to tell her. And then I close it so as not to tell
her. And then I shake my head, "Nothing. I gotta go. Sam's
waiting me in the car", okay, who said that? I can't believe
the things that come out of my mouth.</p>

<p>"You and Sam getting along?", Nicole sounds skeptic. No, she
sounds worried.</p>

<p>Why am I hurting her intentionally?, "Oh yeah, we're best
friends now", and why am I lying?!</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>I arrive home, and it's only midday.  The avoidance game is not
working that well. It's all the same. I've gotta face her
sooner or later. It was stupid of me to sneak out in the morning in
the first place. But somehow taking the easy way out comes so
naturally now. It's in my genes. Like mother, like daughter.</p>

<p>Just hope Sam's not too angry... whose suitcase is that? It's
lying in the hallway, and I'm sure it wasn't there in the
morning. It can't be Sam's? Could she be that upset? A flash
of pain rushes through me. What if she's leaving? It would serve
me right, but I can't believe how much even the thought of that
hurts.</p>

<p>"Sam?!", I yell and start to ascend the stairs. No answer. I
take a few steps and shout again, "Sam!"</p>

<p>"What is it Brooke?", her voice surprises me from behind. I
spin around and find her standing in the living room doorway.</p>

<p>Thank God she isn't gone yet, "Sam, I'm sorry I
wasn't here in the morning..."</p>

<p>"Brooke...", she cuts me short.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I..."</p>

<p>"Your mother is here Brooke."</p>

<p>Stop interrupting me! I've gotta say... "I... huh... you...
What?", I finally stutter out and almost fall down the stairs,
"I mean... what?", she didn't just say what I heard. She
did not say it.</p>

<p>"She came an hour ago", she said it.</p>

<p>I stare at her dumbfounded. I just stare at her for ten seconds while
my mind is catching up with the rest of the world. No awkward
conversation with Sam today. That's been delayed. Instead
I'll be getting my heart ripped out once more by my mother.
Because inside me this feeling of such great hope is surging it's
way up. I'm setting myself up for another big disappointment. And
I can't help it. Cause she's my mother. And I hate my mother.
And I love her. Cause she's my mother.</p>

<p>"And she's here? As in this house?", Sam nods. How can
she be so calm? Didn't I just turn her world upside down last
night? And now this?, "And that's her suitcase..", she
nods again, "Full of stuff that belongs to her."</p>

<p>"She's in the living room right now."</p>

<p>"But... I can't...", what do I say to her?, "I
mean... this is too much...", should I drive her out of the
house? Scream at her, ask for explanations, hug her, slap her, "I
don't know what to say to her."</p>

<p>I'm totally scared. And I'm pleading for Sam to help me.
I'm  pleading for her to make things right. I'm pleading for
her with my eyes. And she does her best. Like always, "Brooke,
just relax", she gives me an encouraging smile, "You don't
have to say anything, or do anything. Just come see her", she
nods a little and keeps smiling, "And I guarantee she's more
nervous than you."</p>

<p>Slowly I walk down the few steps and take a hold of Sam's hand
when she offers it. It feels so warm, so good against my cold one.
The doorway is only a few feet away from us. And then I remember my
spying session from a couple of days back. I sat on the steps and
heard everything Sam and my aunt said in the living room. So that
means she probably heard everything we just said. It doesn't
matter. Just go in already! Move you stupid feet! I look down at
them. Why doesn't anything in my body work properly?</p>

<p>Sam takes the first step and pulls me into motion along with her. I
take one step and my aunt comes to view. She's looking in my
direction and smiles. I take another step and the rest of the room
opens up. And I see her. For the first time in eight years I see her.</p>
