<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 3 -->

<p>Staring at the sun, self inflicted pain. I think I heard it in a song
once. It's all wrong though. It doesn't hurt. Sure it brings
tears to my eyes, but there's no pain. Maybe if I could keep my
eyes on it for just a little bit longer... But I can't. It's
too beautiful, too bright. I have to look away. Have to gather my
strength and then look again. I can see it clearly only for a second,
then the picture starts to blur. There are lights everywhere, and
nothing makes sense anymore. My eyes are watering, and even though
they are not real tears, they feel almost as good. And are much more
safer. I can stop them whenever I want to.</p>

<p>It's a vicious cycle, one which I repeat countless of times. And
would repeat still as many a times if some idiot would only mind his
own business, "Hey? You okay?", the idiot says walking in
front of me. Blocking the sun.</p>

<p>I blink away the last tears and take a better look at him. Just the
type of guy you'd expect to meet at a beach, on a school day.
Some muscles on the upper body, not much but some. Decent looking
face, except for the god awful grin on his mouth. And of course a tan
to kill for.</p>

<p>My silence is throwing off his act. The grin fades away and he moves
his weight from one foot to the other. And back again, "Like we
just thought...", I look the direction his hand swings, slightly
to my left, and see two more guys standing some twenty feet away.</p>

<p>The guy never finishes his sentence, "Maybe you
shouldn't", I say and stand up.</p>

<p>He takes a couple of steps backwards and chuckles, "Shouldn't
what?"</p>

<p>I look at him again and frown, "Think", I say shaking my head
a little. Maybe I shouldn't be so bitchy. But I can't help it,
the guy ruined my afternoon. Slowly I turn around and start walking
towards the parking lot. He follows me. I can hear the soft steps
behind me. No I can't. I can feel them. I can feel his presence
invading my space.</p>

<p>"You're Brooke McQueen, right?", he asks a little too
loud. I turn and take a quick glance at him, all the while still
moving towards my car. I don't know the guy so I frown again,
"Yeah, I thought I recognized you. I go to Kennedy High too."</p>

<p>There's much more confidence in his voice now. So he knows me, so
what? Almost everyone at Kennedy knows my name. And I used to like it
that way. It was such fun when people knew me, and I hadn't a
clue who they were, "Good for you", I say and quicken my step
a little. The car is still fifty yards away.</p>

<p>"Haven't seen you in school lately", maybe because
you're hanging around on the beach all day?, "You know, ever
since you were shun by the royalty. Whatever happened there?"</p>

<p>Oh, okay, it's just some loser on a power trip. Paying back for
all the times I've completely ignored him in the hallway. He might
stand a chance of hurting me, if I wasn't actually glad that I
don't have to deal with Nicole and Josh and the rest, "Stuff
happened."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure", god what an annoying asshole. He jogs up and
starts walking beside me, "But what stuff? Like was it about your
father and that whore he was driving around with? When he died?"</p>

<p>I grin and shake my head, "Sure, why not?"</p>

<p>He doesn't appreciate my stoic attitude, "You're one
cold-hearted bitch, you know that?", he says and stops in his
tracks. Of course I know, everyone knows that.</p>

<p>I keep power walking to my car, leaving him glaring at my back. The
best way to win an argument is to agree on everything the other one
is saying. And then just act like you don't give a fuck about the
whole thing. It always ticks them off. Okay, maybe you don't
actually win the argument, but you sure leave the fight the less
pissed off person.</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>I always take the Greenway Drive these days. Even when I'm
heading for the opposite direction. And every time these silly
thoughts rush into my head. What were they thinking? What were they
doing? Were they talking, fighting, laughing, moping? Were they
talking about their dinner plans? Me and Sam? Planning their wedding?
Was the radio on? What was playing on it? All these stupid questions.
Questions that will never be answered. And when the corner of
Greenway and Park Avenue comes to sight they get more intense. Was
the light green, or did they have to wait for it? Did dad, or Jane,
notice the other car before it hit? Did one of them have time to
shout a warning? Did dad try to swerve out of harms way? Did they die
instantly? Did they know they were gona die? Or did one of them die
in the crash and leave the other one alone wondering what the hell
happened. I try to imagine it. It's hard during daytime, but at
night it's easy. I just wait in the crossing for another car to
come from the left. And then press the gas. I pass the car from good
distance, there's never any danger of a collision, but the lights
of the other car are very helpful for my imagination. I can see it. I
can conjure them back. The horror he must've felt. He had to see
the lights. He had to know what was going to happen. Or maybe the
other car didn't have it's lights on. Then it could be he
never saw it coming. Or Jane. It's hard, so many different
scenarios. All of them possible. And I don't know which one to
pick. Just when I think I have the right one, something else pops up.
Something that doesn't fit that picture. Luckily I have a
lifetime to figure it out.</p>

<p>After I've passed the intersection, the ghosts slowly fade away.
Not all at once, little by little. I see them as they would've
been without the crash. Quietly chattering about whatever is on their
minds at the moment. I can't make out the words, but I can see
Jane's smile. And hear her laughter. It's always the last
thing to go. I can hear it long after her ghost has already
disappeared. I can still hear it when I pull into the driveway. And
then it's gone. Afraid to come home with me. Afraid because the
house is so cold now. It is empty, devoid of love.</p>

<p>Sam has invited some of her friends in today. To fill the emptiness.
She tries to get around the rules. She tries to counter the
loneliness by being in a crowd. It never works. You can be totally
alone even when surrounded by tons of people. I should know. Maybe it
works for Sam though. Her friends seem to care for her. Maybe around
such friends you don't feel lonely.</p>

<p>"Hey Brooke", Carmen chirps when I enter the living room.
She's sitting on the armchair facing the door and is the first
one to notice me.</p>

<p>Sam and Lily are on the couch and turn their heads when Carmen greets
me. There's a nervous smile on Sam's face, "Brooke, why
don't you come sit with us for a while?"</p>

<p>I frown. No thanks, "I don't..."</p>

<p>"Come on. We hardly ever see you anymore", Lily says.</p>

<p>Uh oh... something seems out of place here. It almost seems like they
are planning some sort of an intervention. God I hope I'm wrong,
"So? When did we actually see each other?", it's a sad
day when people with whom I barely exchange hellos have to come to my
rescue.</p>

<p>Sam has gotten up and is walking towards me. I take an unconscious
step backwards, like I'm afraid she might force me to stay. Maybe
I am afraid of that, "Just stay for a second. We can... do that
math thing. You promised to study with me today", she says
stopping some five feet away from me.</p>

<p>"When did I do that?", I answer trying to come up with a yet
another good excuse. Maybe that tired thing again? How's she gona
prove I'm not tired?</p>

<p>"Last night?", Sam is amazingly patient with me these days.
She plays along with all my stupid avoidance games.</p>

<p>I'm almost about to play the sleepy card when something comes to
mind. Something I thought of on the beach, "Oh! I can't right
now!", I'm so exited about having a real reason not to stay I
almost shout the words. And scare Sam in the process, "I mean I
have to talk to Jessica. Do you know where she is?"</p>

<p>She tilts her head slightly to the left and doesn't believe me
for a second, "Sure. She's in the kitchen", Sam says with
a smug face, "Mind if I tag along?"</p>

<p>I tilt my head and mirror her expression, "Not at all, Sam."</p>

<p>The smugness is gone and I'm satisfied. If she insists on
pestering me all the time, I can make it a little harder for her.
It's the least I can do. She follows me into the kitchen where my
dear aunt is making dinner. In the microwave oven. I kinda have to
admire her lack of ambition. She has nothing to do all day and still
doesn't bother to cook a homemade meal for us. Or maybe she
can't.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're home too Brooke", she says when I walk in
with Sam in tow, "How was school?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Brooke. How WAS school?", Sam just can't keep
quiet. She's trying to goat me into a fight. Trying to lure me
out of my hiding place. But I'm way too clever a girl to fall for
that one.</p>

<p>"How should I know? I wasn't there", leaving the question
alone I move onto the topic of today. Mom, "Listen Jessica",
I start with the very same words as this morning, "Is there a way
you could get in touch with her?"</p>

<p>She just looks at me. Concerned, "With who?", Sam asks
surprised. It's still kind of cool when I can do that to her. One
of those little things that make life worth living.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's what you want?", Jessica ignores Sam
completely.</p>

<p>"No", I answer without missing a beat, "Can you do
it?"</p>

<p>She shrugs and bows her head, "I have a number of... an
acquaintance of hers. I can leave a message for him", I can tell
she's not happy about my plan, "Your mom calls if she
calls."</p>

<p>"Your MOM?!", Sam yells loud enough to draw Jessica's
attention. And mine. And probably even Carmen and Lily's,
"The one who abandoned you when you were nine?!"</p>

<p>"I have to agree with Sam here, Brooke", Jessica says, "I
don't think it's a good idea."</p>

<p>"Too bad. My mother, my choice", so just shut up and do it,
"Make the call."</p>
