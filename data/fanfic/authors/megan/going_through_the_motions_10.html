<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 10 -->

<p>I let her stay. I mean she's my mother, and I love her, and I
want her here. She looks happy when I tell her she can stay. But the
sadness still stays with her. I don't think it ever leaves, I
think it's something she's accepted as a part of herself. I
hope I never have to do that. But sometimes it feels like I already
have.</p>

<p>The evening is uncomfortable, and it drags on slower than anything.
Sam asks her little things about her life. What do you do for money?
You're a waitress? That's hard work, isn't it? Where do
you live? Oh, Boston! Lot's of colleges. What? You take courses
in Boston University? That's great, I mean.. it is.. really great.
Don't you think so, Brooke?</p>

<p>And I smile, and I nod, in all the right places. But I say very
little. Mostly I just look at her, and I look at Sam, and it's a
weird conversation. Mom is trying real hard not to say anything
wrong, anything upsetting. And Sam.. I don't know what she's
trying to do. At first it looks like she's interrogating her but
gradually it starts to seem as if she is truly interested in what the
woman is saying. And I almost get the feeling like she's
interviewing her for an article.</p>

<p>Her story, fascinating as it may be, doesn't sit well with my
current state of mind. I try to follow it, but somehow I can't
stay focused. Things start to slip by me and I decide it's time to
excuse myself, "I think I'm gona take a shower and then go to
sleep", I say when an appropriate pause presents itself.</p>

<p>"Wait Brooke. I'll come with you", Sam says when I stand
up.</p>

<p>I look at her and frown a little, "You don't have to Sam."</p>

<p>"No, but I want to", she answers also standing up.</p>

<p>"You want to come to the shower with me?", I ask, shaking my
head a little. A quick glance at my mother tells me that she's
following our exchange with mild curiosity and confusion. I wonder
how she'd deal with me and Sam.. let's not even go there.
It's not like she has any say in anything.</p>

<p>"Well, no", Sam blushes, "But I wanted to talk to you
about something."</p>

<p>I bet. But I'm not sure I'm ready for that conversation,
"Can't it wait?"</p>

<p>"No, Brooke, it can't", she states and her voice is hard.
And that's that. I promised her I wouldn't hurt her anymore,
I wouldn't shut her out. She didn't ask for the promise, but I
made it. And now I wanna break it only four hours later. I was so
right about me. I can't do it. I can't deal with all this
stuff.</p>

<p>"Fine, can I shower first?", I sound irritated.</p>

<p>And Sam notices it, and she's not happy. But she let's it go,
"Of course", she says and sits back down.</p>

<p>"Good night Brooke", mom pipes up before I can make my exit.</p>

<p>I stop at the door for a second, "Night mom", it just leaves
my mouth so naturally. I don't plan to say it, it just comes out.
She is my mother. Might as well call her that.</p>

<p>I walk up to my room and start to undress. I try for some seconds to
pull off my shirt, but all strength seems to have left my body. I
give up and sit down on the bed and start to think about stuff.</p>

<p>I do love Sam. Like I told her. But all this other stuff, this life,
everything that it brings with it seems so hard. I don't know if
I can live up to Sam's expectations. I can't believe she loves
me so much. I can't believe how much she's given up,
sacrificed just for me. Just to be near me. And I can't believe I
wish she hadn't done all that. Our relationship is too
unbalanced. I have too much power over her. If only Sam had all the
power. If only Sam could make all the decisions for me. She's so
good at that. She always does the right thing, says the right words.</p>

<p>She comes into my room fifteen minutes later. I'm still sitting
on the bed in my jeans and my white tee-shirt, "What? No
shower?", she asks and takes the chair.</p>

<p>I shake my head, "No shower."</p>

<p>She shrugs. Doesn't seem too upset anymore, "What are you
gona do about your mother, Brooke?"</p>

<p>What? My mother? Who cares?, "What do you mean? I told her she
could stay."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but are you just gona keep ignoring her like just now,
downstairs?"</p>

<p>I glower at her. Why is she so obsessed with my mother all of a
sudden?, "Give me a fucking break!", I say too loud, and too
angrily. She didn't deserve it, "I saw her for the first time
in eight years today."</p>

<p>Sam backs down a bit. I get the feeling there's something else
behind it all, "Okay, fair enough", she says and leans back,
"Just.. try to see her as she is. Not as she was", is she
actually defending my mother?</p>

<p>"Is that what you wanted to talk about?", I ask putting an
end to the mother business. Who needs it?</p>

<p>She takes a deep breath, "No."</p>

<p>I wait for her to go on. Nothing, "Yeah and..?"</p>

<p>"Why are you so hostile?", Sam finally asks looking straight
at me.</p>

<p>My turn to sigh, "Sam, I'm really tired. If you don't
have anything earth-shattering to say, could it please wait?",
Sam looks sad. Real sad. And tired herself. It's been a long day.
It was a long last night. She probably didn't sleep at all after
my.. attack, "You look like you could use some rest yourself
Sam", I try with a more settling tone.</p>

<p>"I just.. need to know", she whispers. I barely hear it,
"Where you think this'll all lead?"</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen Sam more vulnerable. I hardly
even recognize her with the trembling hands and the faltering voice,
"I have no idea", I say. Why is she asking me? She's the
one with the answers, and the plans, "Honestly Sam. It's just
so much."</p>

<p>"But you'll try, right? Like you promised?", she keeps on
going. I really didn't want this now. I'm too tired, I'll
hurt her just to get rid of her. I know I will, "Like when you
said you loved me, you meant it? It wasn't just to ease the
pain?"</p>

<p>I sigh again. Deep, and bow my head. I try, real hard, and manage to
suppress the initial reaction. Manage to swallow the automated
response, "Yeah. I meant it", she starts breathing again. I
can hear her across the room, "But the thing is Sam, it might not
be enough."</p>

<p>"It's enough", she waits until I raise my head to look at
her again, and then stands up, "It's a start."</p>

<p>No, but wait Sam! I mean to say it out loud. But I don't. Instead
I watch her walk up to me, I watch her slightly brush my forehead
with her fingers. And I watch her smile, before leaving the room.
There's this thing I didn't tell you Sam. This thing that
keeps on gnawing and gnawing at my brain. This thing my mother
said, `I was eighteen when I met your father. I met him at a time
when I was completely isolated from the world, completely alone.
Desperate for any kind of human contact, for anyone to love me'.
How much do I identify with that. And how badly did that end. It's
almost like I'm reliving her life over.</p>

<p>That's stupid Brooke, you make your own choices. Sam said that.
Sam knows more than my mother. Besides, I've known Sam longer. I
knew her when everything was fine. And I think I loved her even then.
I just need to sleep away these bad feelings. Everything'll be
better in the morning.</p>

<p align="center">***</p>

<p>
With Sunday morning comes rain. Rain is good, it washes away all the
dirt. I wake up from the steady sound of rain drops beating against
my window. I wake up feeling better than ever. It's only six in
the morning but I'm all slept out. Still, lying in the bed and
listening to the rain is one of the few small things I love doing. No
matter what mood I'm in. So I stay in bed and think back on last
night. It's a little hazy at first. I can't remember why I
was so cranky. Why I was so worried about all that stuff. It's
all so meaningless. If I love Sam and she loves me, then that's
that. Nothing else matters.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll go wake Sam up and tell her that. She'd be so
surprised, she'd be so happy. The thought of making Sam happy
fills my heart with all kinds of warm feelings. Maybe I'll go
make her some breakfast. Then she'd be even happier. And she
would see that I really love her, and then she wouldn't have to
ask anymore. Cause she would know.</p>

<p>I smile at my own ingenuousness, throw on a bathrobe and sneak
downstairs. Seems someone else has stolen my big idea. More
particularly my mother. She's hogged the kitchen before me.</p>

<p>I stop in the doorway so that she doesn't see me, and observe as
she slices a tomato. I only see her from the side but something about
her expression, her whole posture, takes my breath away. She looks so
concentrated on the task. On this mundane task. And she is herself,
she's not trying to explain things to me, she's not
apologizing, she's just a woman making breakfast. She stands
there and cuts the tomato, again and again, like any other person.
And at that moment I see inside of her. I see beyond what she is to
me, I see her as a whole. And I stop feeling angry at her, I stop
feeling sorry for her, and I just see her, as she is in the world.
Trying to live her life like anyone else. And even if I can't
forgive her today, or tomorrow, or this week, or this month, I know
that someday I can. Someday I'll be able to look her in the eyes
and smile, and I can say: I'm happy you're my mom, I
wouldn't trade you for anyone.</p>

<p>She raises her head a little and catches a glimpse of my reflection
from the window. Her knife hand twitches back a little and she
manages to cut her left thumb, "Aww.. shit!", she cries and
drops the knife, "Oh damn!"</p>

<p>I grab a paper towel and move closer, "Here let me help", she
turns and gawks at me like I had two heads. She's hiding the
injured finger inside her right palm, "Come on, mom. How bad is
it?", I go on when she just stands there.</p>

<p>Finally she startles out of it, "It's.. it's nothing
Brooke. Just a little cut", she answers and reveals the injured
finger.</p>

<p>The wound is not big, but it's bleeding pretty much,
"Okay", I say and take a hold of her hand. It's warm and
so soft, just like I remembered it, "I'll just..", I wrap
the towel around the thumb, and press it lightly.</p>

<p>"Brooke", she whispers and lifts her free hand to brush my
hair. It never reaches it's target though, just hovers above my
head.</p>

<p>I meet her gaze and she's crying. Silently, but the tears are
visible. I smile at her, "Still can't sleep when it
rains?"</p>

<p>She shakes her head and laughs through the tears. And slowly lowers
her hand back down. It's another secret thing we shared when I
was a child. Whenever it rained in the night she would come to my
room and we would sit on my bed and look out the window. It
didn't happen often, we live in California after all. How weird
is it then that it rains the first night she comes back.</p>

<p>She dries off her eyes, "So you want some breakfast? I managed to
make two sandwiches before cutting off my finger", she says and
pulls away her hand when I release it.</p>

<p>"Sure. Let me just get a band-aid for that", I answer.</p>

<p>We sit at the table and eat. Quietly, no talk. And it's the
closest I've felt to her since her return. Jessica comes down a
few minutes later and ruins the moment. When the chatter starts
mom's walls rise back up. She thinks carefully about everything
she says, and I always get the feeling she's not telling the whole
truth. And I don't like it. I leave quickly, before the
resentment has time to return. "I'll go wake Sam up", I
say remembering my original mission.</p>

<p>The two sisters both look at me for a moment and then nod. Something
in my aunts eyes tells me she knows more than she should. She knows a
lot. Maybe everything. Depends on how well Sam's been hiding her
feelings. But it doesn't matter. Jessica is great that way. She
doesn't judge, sometimes it seems she doesn't even care, but
that's not right. She cares, she just doesn't interfere
unless asked. Maybe she wouldn't make a good parent, but she sure
is a great aunt.</p>

<p>Sam is already awake. Her door is open and she's brushing her
hair in front of the mirror, "Hey", she says when I enter the
room.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself", I answer her and stop in the middle of the
room.</p>

<p>Sam turns around in her chair and smiles, "You look better."</p>

<p>"I am", I nod a couple of times, "I wanted to tell you
something."</p>

<p>"What?", Sam asks.</p>

<p>I bow my head and start rubbing my hands together nervously. I have
no idea what's gona come out of my mouth. Maybe I should start
planning things a little better, "I'm pretty sure I love you
more than I'll ever love anything", I start and decide to say
everything that comes to my mind. I don't sensor, I just talk,
"And if you love me as much, and can forgive me every bad thing
I've done to you", I swallow hard, "And the ones that
I'll do in the future..", I raise my head up and startle a
little when I find Sam standing right in front of me. But the things
need to be said, "Cause I will hurt you again Sam. I know myself
too well", she opens her mouth to say something, but I'm
quicker, "And I know this good feeling that's inside me now,
will eventually pass, and that's when I'll hurt you. Cause
that's when I don't care about anything", she doesn't
believe me. But she'll learn, sooner or later. I can be one evil
chick when I'm in the mood, "So, if you can forgive me, then
I think I want to be with you. Always."</p>

<p>Sam only looks at me first and then grins, "Could you be a little
more dramatic Brooke?"</p>

<p>"It's not funny Sam. It's the way it is."</p>

<p>She keeps on grinning and then shrugs, "All right. You believe it
if you need to. And I promise to forgive you. Every time",
she's acting like nothing, "I guess we just have to make sure
you feel all good, all the time", it's a joke to her. Sam is
so strong, she's not afraid of anything. When she leans in and
hugs me, I hug her back, "You won't hurt me Brooke. As long
as you love me, nothing can hurt me", and maybe Sam is right, she
often is.</p>

<p>I look into the mirror and see Sam's back, and her brown hair
flowing free. I see my face, leaning on her shoulder. I see my blonde
hair mix with her brown. And it makes me feel good. It makes me feel
like I'm home. Where I belong.</p>
