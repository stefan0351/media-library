<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 2 -->

<p>"Brooke!", a scream penetrates through the barrier that
separates the waking world and the dream world. I ignore it.
My dream isn't over yet, it has barely begun. Dreams are my
one comfort. In them I can still feel. In them I am happy
sometimes, sad at others. In them dad and Jane are still
alive. And we do stuff, we are a family, "Brooke!", it
comes again, this time accompanied by loud banging noises.
I still try to ignore the voices, but they've got a hold on
me now. They are pulling me away from my beautiful dreams,
"Brooke! Open the door!"</p>

<p>My eyes shoot open. This is the real world. The one where all
the insufferable voices are emitting from, "Brooke!", this
time I recognize the voice as Sam's. Figures. Last night
comes back in very vivid flashes. I guess I was wrong in
thinking my zombie state was permanent. It's not. Sam's gona
reverse it, I know she is. And I can't stop her. Nothing
short of killing her is going to stop Sam when she gets
something in her head, "BROOKE!", she yells even louder if
possible.</p>

<p>I get up and slouch to the door before she wakes up the whole
neighborhood. It takes a while for me to fumble first the
lock open and then the door itself, but Sam isn't screaming
anymore, so there's no rush. She's probably heard me through
the door.</p>

<p>I put on my most vehement face and pull open the door, "What.
Are. You. Doing?"</p>

<p>Sam gapes at me her mouth open. There's a single tear rolling
down her cheek. And she's fidgeting around like crazy, "You
didn't answer...", her voice trembles badly, "And I
thought... maybe something had happened... and..."</p>

<p>Oh, I see. I'm on suicide watch now, "You thought maybe I had
swallowed a couple of hundred sleeping pills?"</p>

<p>Sam is way upset. More tears start to dribble down her face and
if I had any compassion left in me I'd give her a break, "I
was just worried about you", she whispers through her sobbing.</p>

<p>Somewhere deep within me this feeling emerges. It surges through
the wall and I recognize it. Pity. I feel sorry for Sam. First
time for everything I guess. A moment goes by while I struggle
over what to do. A part of me wants to slam the door to her face
and bury this feeling-crap so deep it'll take a hundred years to
dig it back up. But the feeling-crap isn't cooperating. It wants
more control. It wants me to hug Sam. Say I'm sorry.</p>

<p>I settle for the middle ground. I don't apologize, but I
don't slam the door shut either, "Look Sam, you should take
my aunt's advice. Just concentrate on yourself. I'll live
through this, don't worry."</p>

<p>"How...?", Sam says and tries to dry off her eyes, "Have
you been listening in on us?", oh yeah, I wasn't supposed
to know that. Too bad. I shrug it off, "Could you...",
Sam's voice falters. She clears her throat and starts
again, "Could you stop with the shoulder shrugs? That's
like the most stupid answer ever."</p>

<p>"So I overheard you and Jessica. It was good advice, you should
take it", I refuse to acknowledge her remark on my new very
bestest response.</p>

<p>"I like your aunt Brooke, but to be perfectly honest, what the
hell does she know about any of this? When's the last time you
had any contact with her before the accident", Sam picks
herself up and brushes off the momentary lapse in self
control.</p>

<p>Okay, so my aunt really hasn't kept in touch lately. She sends
Christmas cards and maybe even an occasional present but the
last time I saw her, was some three years ago. She used to
come by often when I was little, when mom was still around.
But after that bitch split, Jessica kinda felt guilty for her
sister I guess. I never said anything to indicate that, and I
don't think dad did either, still mom was her little sister so
she felt at least partly responsible for her actions.</p>

<p>"Please don't badmouth my aunt", I say quietly.</p>

<p>"Didn't mean it like that. But she is wrong", Sam says
and turns around. I notice she's carrying her bag and
she's heading for the stairs. A quick glance at my watch
tells me I've overslept. Again. Once Sam reaches the
stairs she turns around again, "Oh, I came to tell you
school starts in half an hour. You planning on coming?",
I stare at her for a second and then nod. Sure. Why not?
School's just as good as any place. Sam opens her mouth
to say something more but decides against it then. She
leaves me standing alone in my doorway. That mom stuff
is still dancing around in my head, leaving me all
confused.</p>

<p>I'm gona be so late for school. There's no way I'm
leaving before a long shower. I feel all filthy and
sweaty and stuff. That's what you get for sleeping ten
hours in jeans and a sweater. Otherwise my morning
routines take much less time than they used to. I
usually just take a quick shower and brush my hair so
it won't hang on my face. All my make-up just sits on
the table. I won't touch that stuff anymore. A couple
of times I've thought of throwing them all away, but
something always stops me. After all the time I've
spent in front of the mirror enhancing myself it seems
wrong to just ditch all that stuff.</p>

<p>This morning rushes by with speed I thought impossible. Before
I know it the time is closing in on ten. That's two hours
I'm late already. Where the hell did those hours go? I
couldn't have spent them in the shower, could I? Maybe I
could've, who knows. Time is such a tricky thing. Sometimes
it won't move no matter how much you pray, and other times
it just flies by. Like today. Jessica is n the kitchen when
I make my appearance. She's a free woman these days. Dad
left a big allowance for our caretaker. I don't know if she
ever plans on going back to work. And I don't care.</p>

<p>When I enter the room Jessica lifts her nose from the paper
and smiles. When she smiles she looks just like my mother.
Only older, "Good morning Brooke. Sleep well?"</p>

<p>"Like the dead", let's try a little of that morbid humor.
Too bad Sam isn't here. She'd really appreciate it after
all that suicide talk.</p>

<p>My aunt doesn't know how to take it. The smile disappears and
she looks confused. Then she shakes her head, "There's
coffee. And I could make you some breakfast."</p>

<p>"Coffee's plenty."</p>

<p>"No, you gotta eat something Brooke", Jessica says and stands up.</p>

<p>I stare directly into her eyes, "Coffee's plenty."</p>

<p>Cool, there's power in my ice cold voice. And in my ice cold
stare. She sits down so fast that her own coffee spills, "Oh
damn!", she cries and uses the newspaper to clean up.</p>

<p>"Listen Jessica", the words jump out when I make my way to
the counter, "There's something I want to ask you."</p>

<p>I don't see her but judging from the silence she's stunned.
Of course she is. Even I'm stunned, "Sure Brooke. Ask away."</p>

<p>Little by little my hand starts to tremble while I pour the
coffee. It gets worse and worse until I have to set the pot
back down. I look at my hand and don't recognize it. It's got
a mind of it's own. It doesn't obey my commands, just shakes
there. No, that's not right. My mind is making it shake. It's
telling me to keep my mouth shut. Don't ask it. There's
nothing to be gained by the question. But I want to ask it.</p>

<p>Slowly I open my mouth and force the words out one by one.
Funny, the first one's came out all on their own, I couldn't
have kept them in even if I tried. And now these one's fight
back with all their might, "Why... didn't my... your...
she...", way to make a coherent sentence Brookie.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Huh?", I spin around. She couldn't have understood
anything from my ramblings.</p>

<p>"I don't know why your mother didn't come. I haven't
spoken to her in quite some time", so she did understand.
Had probably expected the question even. I have never
asked about my mother from her. I don't... didn't want
anyone toknow I still cared about what she did, where she
was. If she was all right. But during the couple of
visits Jessica made when dad was still alive, I always
listened around a corner when the two would talk. Hoping
and praying that dad would ask the question I didn't have
the guts to ask. And sometimes he did. And Jessica's
reply was always the same, `Last I heard she was in New
York', or Boston, or Philadelphia. Where-ever, but always
in the east, `She calls sometimes, asks for money,
asks how Brooke is doing', and dad would get all angry and
why doesn't she call here and ask for herself. But I don't
care. It's enough that she still asks about me. Means she
still loves me on some level.</p>

<p>But now, with dad dying and she doesn't even bother to
call... that's something evil, "She probably doesn't even
know about it", it's like Jessica's reading my mind. She
says just the things I want to here. And makes me feel all
good. Too good. Gotta watch it with these conversations. An
occasional feeling isn't that dangerous but if I'm not
careful, they can all slip out. And then I'm in trouble. No
way I'm capable of handling that kind of baggage.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's all the same anyway. I was just curious", and she
nods. Doesn't say anything just nods. There's just something
too weird about my aunt. She is like overly calm. Total
control. At peace, that's the one. At peace with herself.</p>

<p>I drink my coffee, politely shake my head when Jessica offers
a lift to school, and finally leave the house ten minutes
later. It's a beautiful day. Maybe I'll skip school. Go for a
little drive. Yeah... that sounds good.</p>
