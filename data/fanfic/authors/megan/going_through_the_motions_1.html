<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 1 -->

<p>It's funny how quickly things happen when a change is overdue.
Maybe funny is the wrong word in this case. Let's say...
interesting. Funny, interesting, whatever. They're just words,
words that mean nothing to me now. I can't see myself ever
feeling joy, ever being interested in anything again. All that
is in the past. My new life is much more simpler: eat, sleep,
study. Well at least sleep and study. I don't eat that much
anymore. Just like I don't feel that much either.</p>

<p>Sam is much stronger than me. She lost just as much, and yet
she's coping. I see the way she fights to get her life back
together, the way she tries to make sense of things. And I
try to reach inside of myself and find that same strength. I
used to have it. I was never one to give up. But now... I
don't see the point. My aunt keeps saying that the pain will
let up, time will heal, and I look at her. She doesn't
understand, and I don't explain. I don't tell her that the
pain has already gone. I don't tell her that I actually miss
the pain, at least it was a feeling. It's this emptiness
that is killing me. This total lack of emotions. She has
guessed something though. She knows, and Sam knows, that
there is something wrong with me.</p>

<p>They are talking about me right now. I can hear them in the
living room while I sit on the stairs and eavesdrop, "It's
been two weeks already", I hear Sam's clear voice. She
sounds worried. Worried about me. Weird.</p>

<p>"There are no time limits on grieving Sam", my aunt Jessica
says. She's the one who pulled the short straw I guess. When
they were deciding who should take care of us, "Brooke takes
things to herself. She feels things much deeper than most
people", I would smile at the irony of the statement, if I
could. But I don't know how to move my mouth into that
position anymore.</p>

<p>There's a silence and I stand up ready to leave, but then
Sam speaks again, "But it doesn't look like she's
grieving. She's like a zombie or something", Sam really is
very perceptive. Even through her own sorrow she has seen
what really is going on with me. Zombie... that's actually
very close to the truth, "When's the last time she
initiated a conversation?"</p>

<p>I ponder on Sam's question for a while. It's been a time.
Sure there were a couple of times after the accident. But
not a single one during the last week comes to mind, "It'll
pass Sam. You concentrate on yourself", Jessica finally
replies.</p>

<p>I take that as my que, and ascend the stairs quietly. The
biggest problem with my new life is time. There's just SO
much of it, and nothing to do with it. You can only sleep so
much. So I study. Not because I care one bit about school,
but because it passes the time. It's a shame nothing seems
to stick in my head, otherwise I might solve the mysteries
of the universe. Or at least A mystery. But no matter how
many times I read something it always escapes my mind. Maybe
it's like a defense mechanism, so I don't run out of books to
read. Then what would I do?</p>

<p>I barely manage to get into my room, close the door and sit
down at my table, when already someone's out to bug me,
"Brooke...", Sam's voice comes through the closed door,
"Are you in there Brooke?", so much for concentrating on
yourself, ha Sam? I don't especially enjoy the idea of Sam
giving me the third degree so I just keep my mouth shut and
hope she'll go away. No such luck, first I hear the handle
being pulled down and then the oh, so familiar screeching
sound the door makes when opened. I turn my head slightly
and use the mirror to spy on Sam. She takes two steps inside
my room and catches my gaze from the mirror, "What'ya
doin'?", I settle for a shrug, "I called from the
hallway. Maybe you didn't hear..."</p>

<p>"I heard", I say and finally turn around to face her,
"What do you want?"</p>

<p>She was expecting the hostile treatment. Doesn't flinch a
bit, "I thought maybe we could study together. That math is
like... hard."</p>

<p>Sam's vocabulary fails her so rarely that even in my
zombified state it amazes me. Before I even know it memories
flood over me. They come so quietly, so fast, there is no
fighting against them.</p>

<p>Sam and me in the kitchen. Sam and me bickering over whichever
stupid little thing. The reason is trivial, the fight is
everything. This time I say something that makes Sam gasp. And
then her mother walks in. She walks in just as Sam
screams, `Bitch!' `Sam!', she is shocked. Jane
isn't used to
our fights yet. They haven't lived with us that long. `But
mom... Brooke is like... she said...', Sam starts to stutter,
searching for the right words. And it is the cutest thing ever.
So I smile.</p>

<p>"What?", Sam asks and pulls me back to reality. Oh crap. I
liked it in the memory land.</p>

<p>I notice the confused expression on Sam's face. She doesn't
know whether to grin or frown, "What what?"</p>

<p>"You were smiling", she says, "You haven't done that
since... in a while", an embarrassed smile twists it way on
to her mouth.</p>

<p>I shrug again. It's such a great reply. Doesn't require any
thought whatsoever. And good for any situation. This time
though, I feel the need to elaborate myself a little, "Just
some happy memories."</p>

<p>Sam nods once, twice, "Yeah, I have a couple of those too",
why on earth she said that, I don't know. And apparently so
doesn't she. There's a pause, which I guess would've been
an awkward one in our post-accident life. Nothing's
awkward anymore though, "So, how about that study session?"</p>

<p>Oh yeah that. I had completely forgotten it already, "I don't
know Sam...", I try to think of a good excuse, "I'm
really tired... maybe tomorrow?", why do today what you can
put off till tomorrow.</p>

<p>Sam doesn't accept this. She sits down on my bed, an act which
earns her a frown from me, "Could we like, just talk then?"</p>

<p>Oh my God! I'm never getting rid of her. What could we
possibly talk about?, "Let me guess. You want me to tell you
how I feel about the accident. Cause it just isn't healthy to
keep these things inside?", I try to sound sarcastic. I'm a
bit rusty though.</p>

<p>Sam looks straight at me, "Not what I was gona say", yeah
right, "We can talk about anything. Or do anything. You can't
just block out the whole world Brooke."</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, seems I not only can do it, but I've actually
already done it."</p>

<p>"Well then undo it", Sam says sounding a little irritated.</p>

<p>"Why?", my tone stays the same. It hasn't changed in two
weeks, why should it now.</p>

<p>"Because if you don't, you'll never get over it."</p>

<p>Why do people always think they should get over the death of
a loved one? Or ones in this case, since I did love Jane too.
Not as a mother, but still I loved her. I don't want to get
over it. That's one step away from forgetting them. But I
don't tell this to Sam. I just keep staring at her. Until
she's had enough.</p>

<p>"God Brooke! What the hell is it? I lost them too you know",
Sam is loosing it. She is getting angrier and angrier by
each passing second.</p>

<p>I have to do something, to say something to defuse her,
otherwise there's no telling where this'll end,
"Sam...", I start bowing my head, "Just because I
don't talk about it, doesn't mean I'm not dealing with
it. Cause I am, you know. I do think about it a lot, and
I am making progress", lying is so much easier now. It's
like I only have to open my mouth and these things come
out. I don't even have to plan the lies in advance, I
just... open my mouth. I raise my head back up.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you", Sam answers. Just like that, she
sees through me and my lies. But her anger is slightly
subdued, "I don't believe you think about the accident at
all. And you're certainly not dealing with the effects it
had on you."</p>

<p>The old me would've bitten her head off for that response.
Not the new me though. The new me sighs and crosses her
hands, "Right... look I've tried to be patient here, but
the truth is, I can't stand your company Sam. Couldn't you
just... care less about me?"</p>

<p>Even that isn't enough to drive her away. It doesn't even
bring that anger thing back, "Good", she says, totally
surprising me. Momentarily. Then I realize she's glad her
words got an actual reaction out of me. Not just that
usual so what, "And no, I couldn't care less about...
you... wait. That sounded all wrong... I meant..."</p>

<p>"Whatever. Just leave, please", how dare she come in here
and start tearing down my safety walls. I spent an eternity
last week building them. She still doesn't move,
"Please", I beg again.</p>

<p>"Brooke..."</p>

<p>I cut her off quickly, "No Sam! No more talk! I want to be
alone", I jump on my feet ready to throw her out if need be.
I'm freaking out here. I need time to myself. Time to make
some repairs.</p>

<p>And finally she stands up, then hesitates for a second before
rushing out. I close the door behind her, lock it, and fall
on my bed. Burying my face into a pillow. I fight back the
tears that almost make it out. They are close, glistening my
eyes. But I can't let out a single one, cause if I do, then
they all want to come. And there's a LOT of them. So I fight.
It's not that hard when you know how. And I know. I take it
one second at a time. And I only concentrate on that second.
I don't think about anything but that precise second. And
then I move on to the next. And the next. They crawl by at
first but after a while they start to pick up some speed.
And pretty soon time is just flying by and I'm not crying.
I'm okay. And I don't even notice the drowsiness sneaking
up on me...</p>
