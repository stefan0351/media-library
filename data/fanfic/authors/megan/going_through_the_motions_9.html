<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 9 -->

<p>The corner of  Greenway Drive and Park Avenue is so very close. A
walking distance from the house. The weird thing is, that it's so
scarcely trafficked. Especially late at night. I can't believe
the accident happened here. Dad and Jane had to be hit by the only
other car in a mile's distance. Of all the bad luck.</p>

<p>At three p.m. there's still some traffic here. I sit on a bench
at a bus stop and watch all the cars drive through the intersection.
I watch them wait at the lights, and then speed through. All of them.
There are no close calls. Not even a single one. I wonder if someone
has done a research on how many accidents happen here. And I wonder
where I could get my hands on such a research. I could go to the
library and scan through all the local papers, do my own study. That
sounds just so much fun. Too much.</p>

<p>A gray ford pulls into the stop. A loud base is pumping through the
open windows and a brunette girl of maybe thirteen steps out of the
front passenger door. She leans down and says something to the
driver. Then the car speeds of and I follow as it drives straight
through the green lights and takes a right turn on Greenway. Away
from the house. To the direction dad and Jane were coming from. I
keep turning my head around further and further, trying to follow
it's route until finally the car disappears behind a building.
Another one got through. What was it that made dad and Jane so
special? Why were they picked?</p>

<p>"That was my brother. Cool car, ha?", the thirteenish girl
surprises me. I fling my head back just as she sits next to me on the
bench. She's way upbeat, has an adorable smile on her face. I
smile back and nod my head once, "So where you headed?"</p>

<p>"To the city", I answer without thinking. My auto pilot seems
to be on lie-mode today. Well, the girl deserves it, who goes around
initiating conversations with strangers?</p>

<p>"Hey, me too!", she chirps and grins, "Don't you just
love LA?", I shrug, "Yeah I know, you've probably gotten
tired of it already, hey? Not me though", she goes on and takes a
quick glance down Park Avenue. Scouting for the bus, "I could
spend hours just walking the streets. And I can't wait till
I'm old enough to get into clubs and stuff", it's kinda
fun listening her talk. So carefree, "Hey, you wanna borrow a
tissue or something? Cause your eyes are", she says grimacing and
waving a finger at her own eyes, "kind of a mess, you know?"</p>

<p>Yeah, I know, I wept the whole way down here, "You carry around
tissues?", I ask eyeing her from head to toe. She's dressed
in blue jeans and a black sweater. I'm almost scared to think
where she might have hidden the tissues. Or in what condition they
are.</p>

<p>Again she grins, "Well, no. I just thought it was polite to
offer", I laugh out loud. She's great!, "But seriously,
you gotta do something to your eyes. They are all puffy and smudged
and wet and whatnot."</p>

<p>"Yeah", I say when I stop laughing. I still keep smiling
though, "I'm gona head for that gas station soon as I've
rested enough", I say and nod towards the building across the
street.</p>

<p>"But you'll miss the bus", she says a little confused.</p>

<p>I'll miss the bus. Damn! Suddenly getting on that bus seems so
appealing. Just get on that bus and go where-ever I want. You
wouldn't believe the feeling of freedom Brooke. Who said that? My
mother. Only some two hours ago. Seems much longer. Or shorter.
Depends on how long an hour usually feels. I don't remember
anymore.</p>

<p>"Here it comes already!", she says and jumps up. I look down
the road and sure enough there it is, "Come on, you can clean up
in LA, there are rest rooms there too. I don't wanna sit all by
myself in the bus."</p>

<p>I get up and walk to the curb behind her. I could just get in, and
leave. There's nothing for me here, nothing for me at home. I
turn and look across the intersection, towards the house. Of course I
can't see it, it's maybe a mile away. But I can picture it.
In all it's emptiness, and it's former queen who has returned
from exile. Nothing there. Nothing but... Sam, walking down the hill.
Towards me. Her head is spinning around until her eyes meet mine.
She's almost fifty yards away, but I can see her smile when she
recognizes me. What IS she made of? How can she forgive me everything
before I even get a chance to apologize?</p>

<p>I see her only for a second. Then the view is blocked by the
monstrous bus. I think I hear a faint voice calling me over the
rumbling sound of the engine. It's too distant to take into
notice though.</p>

<p>"Come", the girl is motioning for me to follow her inside.
She's grinning. I like her. A lot.</p>

<p>But not enough. I shake my head slightly, "Nah, I'll catch a
later bus."</p>

<p>"You sure?", she asks and I nod, "Okay, see ya", she
shrugs and flashes that adorable grin one more time, "I'm
Dana by the way."</p>

<p>"Brooke", I answer and smile. I really like her. I like her
cause she's got nothing to do with my life. I like her cause
she's the first thing that made me laugh, made me forget. Even if
it was only for a minute. I like her even though I know nothing about
her.</p>

<p>She disappears deeper into the depths of the metal thingy. I look
after her for a moment and then take a few steps back when the bus
leaves. So as to avoid the enormous fume clouds emitting from it. It
moves maybe two bus lengths before coming to an abrupt halt again.</p>

<p>"Wait!", I hear Sam's voice. She comes around from the
front of the bus and stops at the front door. She doesn't see me.
She must've run like crazy across the road to cut off the bus. The
driver opens the door and throws some curses at Sam. She isn't
impressed. Instead she hops inside.</p>

<p>Great. Now she's in the bus and I'm not. Why didn't I
just shout to her? God, why can't I do anything like a normal
person?! Slowly I start to make my way to the front door, all the
while trying to catch a glimpse from the inside. Ten seconds go by.
Fifteen. And nothing happens.</p>

<p>When I'm almost at door I hear her voice, "... the blonde
that got in from this stop?", she sounds annoyed.</p>

<p>"The blonde didn't get in", the driver is even more
annoyed. I see them now, through the open door. I see Sam's back,
and the side of her face when she's trying to look for me inside
the bus.</p>

<p>"No, but I saw her. She was standing.."</p>

<p>"The blonde did! not! get! in!", the middle-aged man shouts
from the top of his lungs. Sam almost falls out of the bus, onto her
back. The facts are just not registering into her head. She turns to
stare at the driver.</p>

<p>"Sam?", I ask timidly, before the guy pulls out a gun and
shoots her.</p>

<p>She turns around still in a state of daze, "Brooke? You
didn't get in?", she frowns.</p>

<p>I shake my head a little, "All good?", the driver is
glowering behind her, "Good. Now get out!", he answers his
own question.</p>

<p>Sam takes a quick glance over her shoulder and then steps back out.
The door closes right behind her and the bus leaves again. She's
standing only a few steps away from me. I can see the relief in her
features, "Why are you here Brooke?", she asks taking a step
closer. But still afraid to come too close. She must think I'm
some kind of a wild animal, that'll run if provoked.</p>

<p>"Why are you?", I ask back.</p>

<p>She smiles and shrugs, "Jessica said you ran out. I had to come
look for you."</p>

<p>"But why?", I ask again and bow my head. A few stray hairs
fall from their place and hang annoyingly on my face, "I'll
only hurt you more and more."</p>

<p>It takes a moment for her to answer, "You still don't
know?", her hand comes from out of nowhere and brushes away the
few rebel hairs. It puts them back in their place, and then rests on
my cheek for a while before pulling away, "How much I love
you?"</p>

<p>Maybe I do know. Maybe it's bad that I know. Cause I'll only
abuse that love, use it and then discard it. Use you, and then dump
you, "How can you love me so much, when I'm such utter
garbage? I don't deserve you, and I definitely don't deserve
your love."</p>

<p>"You're not garbage. You are just a girl trying to survive a
bad situation."</p>

<p>She takes another step closer. But I push her away, "Don't
Sam. I'll only hurt you again and again", I say and look at
her.</p>

<p>"And I'll still love you", she's pretending to have
all the answers again. She's so sure of herself, I really have no
way of competing with her. Might as well give up now, and see how
much she means what she says.</p>

<p>I'll give it one more shot. Give her one more chance to back
away, "Don't you even care if I love you back or not?",
that shuts her up. She wasn't expecting it. I can hurt her again
if I want to. And after this strike she won't be coming back for
more, "See Sam? See how easy it is for me? I have no little voice
inside that's telling me to stop."</p>

<p>We stare at each other for a good half a minute. I wait for her to
break down. She doesn't, she's too strong. But she does hurt,
she can't hide that. She gets angry when she hurts. And when she
gets angry she loses control, and that's when I can see it.
That's when I see the pain and the suffering she keeps inside.
She hides them as well as I hide mine, but when she's angry I can
see it.</p>

<p>"Good for you Brooke. Maybe you're right then", she says
and starts to walk away, "Enjoy the rest of your life. At least
you have you're mother now to share it with."</p>

<p>I can't let her have the last word. That's the way we always
end things, and she always comes back. So I start after her,
"Yeah, me and my mother. We are so much alike, it's
scary."</p>

<p>We cross the road. Sam's heading for the house. She's walking
so fast I have to scurry to keep up, "You really aren't
Brooke", she says shaking her head slightly, "At least your
mother has a heart. At least she doesn't intentionally go around
hurting people just to prove what a bitch she is."</p>

<p>"What?", why did she say that? How could she say that? She
hates my mother, she knows what my mother has done. I stop
walking, "You didn't mean that."</p>

<p>Sam stops too. She has an evil grin on her face, "Oh, I
didn't hurt your feelings, did I, Brookie?"</p>

<p>"You hate my mother. You have to hate her."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because", I say and try to think of a reason, "Because
she's my mother. She's the reason everything sucks. The
reason I am this way."</p>

<p>Sam's face softens a touch, "That's just stupid Brooke.
You can't blame everything on her."</p>

<p>"No, I can! You didn't hear what she said", this is going
well Brooke. Only two minutes has passed and already you're
begging for Sam's help, "You didn't hear", I repeat
more quietly, "We are exactly alike. Every decision she's
made, I've made. Everything she's done, I've done", I
set out to drive her away, and instead I'm pulling her back.
Cause I can't live without her. I just can't.</p>

<p>She looks at me for the longest time. And again she forgives me. Even
when I don't ask for it. This isn't healthy. This is not the
way it's supposed to work, "Come on. You're overreacting.
Your life is your own, you make the decisions. Not her."</p>

<p>I want to cry again. But not out here, "But the things she
said", I plead with a pitiful voice, "The words she
used", it's no more than a whisper. I tap my head a couple of
times and nod, "They're from here. They are my thoughts, my
feelings."</p>

<p>Sam hesitates only for a second. When the first tear rolls out of my
eye she envelopes me into a powerful hug. I cry, I bury my face into
her hair and I cry. I don't wanna cry out here, but it's
okay. Cause Sam's here too. And she'll protect me,
"I'm sorry Sam", I whisper into her ear. At least I think
I do. Can't be sure if the words ever leave my mouth, "I do
love you", how could I not love her? How could anyone not love
her?</p>
