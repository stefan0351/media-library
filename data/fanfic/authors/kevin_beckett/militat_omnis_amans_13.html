<p>Sleeping peacefully, breathing evenly, little fists clenched in
dreams.  Two little girls lay entwined together under down
comforters that were embroidered with pictures of kittens and
bunnies.  Watching over them from the foot of the crib was a grey and
black cat, pleased with her human's kittens.</p>

<p>"Purr," said Shadow-Cat thinking, "my human has done well.  Her
kittens are safe with me."</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>"Pay attention, damn it," yelled Willow, as she swept Buffy's
legs out from underneath her for the third time that morning,
"get your mind back here."</p>

<p>Buffy collapsed to the ground before rolling into a ball and
springing back up to her feet.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I just finding that it's hard."</p>

<p>"I know it's hard," replied her spouse, "but they've been fed,
they're sleeping, Bridie and Aiofe are in the room with them and Shadow-Cat
is watching them and I can see them through her eyes."</p>

<p>"Ok," said Buffy, "I'll stay sharp.  Let's get back to it."</p>

<p>It was just after dawn and Buffy and Willow were in the training area,
with Daithi and some of the new slayers, trying to work off their baby
flab and to get back into fighting form.</p>

<p>Buffy moved into an Aikido stance, matched by Willow.  They
slowly circled each other for a few moments before Buffy moved
forward quickly, directing a punch towards Willow's chest.
Willow timed her response perfectly and moved around Buffy's
punch, before grabbing her outstretched arm and then pivoting
around it.  She planted her feet, swung Buffy towards her, and
rolled the slayer over her back and onto the dirt floor.</p>

<p>"Ooof," said Buffy as she fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"You still aren't here, lover," said Willow, as she returned to a ready
stance, "let's get back at it."</p>

<p>Buffy regained her place, and the two young women continued
sparing.  After a few minutes in which neither woman made any
attacks, Willow leaped and directed an attack down towards
Buffy's head.  Buffy reached forward, grabbed Willow's descending arm
and pulled it down and away from her body.  Buffy then used
the momentum generated to roll Willow over and onto her back.</p>

<p>Willow continued the roll, jumped to her feet, and said, "better, now
you are into it."</p>

<p>They continued to spar for another hour, both women now fully
focused.  Finally, Willow turned to her lover and said, "Buffy,
time to finish.  I'm bushed."</p>

<p>"Okay with me.  Let's cool down and head for the baths."</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy began their end of workout stretching routine.  When
they were about halfway through the routine, Willow said,
"so what do we want to do tonight?"</p>

<p>It was the third day after the solstice, Christmas Eve back home.  The
entire community had been celebrating, feasting, gift giving and relaxing
since the solstice, and would continue to do so for another nine days,
but Buffy and Willow wanted to make this
evening special.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Buffy, "we could get a tree and stuff I
suppose."</p>

<p>"And eggnog, carols and stuff.  We could make decorations and
stuff too."</p>

<p>"Will, girl, you are way into this for a good Jewish Wiccan,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Hey," said Willow, "growing up in Southern Cal. What do you
expect?"</p>

<p>They finished their cool down and headed for the baths.  Just as they
were reaching the bath complex Willow said, "hey, let's get Aiofe and
Bridie in on this.  It'll be a blast."</p>

<p>They met with several of the inn's inhabitants in the baths, all of them
trying to sweat off the excesses of the last few days.
Buffy looked around and said, "lets finish up quickly and head
back to our room.  So we can relax."</p>

<p>"Relax you call it," said Aiofe, as she entered the change room
behind Willow and Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yep," said Buffy, "relax."</p>

<p>"What's up," said Willow, as she began to strip off her sweat
stained clothing.</p>

<p>"Not too much," said Aiofe, "Bridie and the girls are still
sleeping, so I decided to grab a quick bath, and something to
eat."</p>

<p>The three women headed for the warm bath, to rinse off the dirt
from their bodies before they washed their bodies and hair.  Once they
had finished bathing, they retired to their change room.</p>

<p>"Oh, before I forget," said Aiofe, "I ran into Amana on the way
over here."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Willow, pulling a thick wool shift over her head,
"what did she want, and can it wait until this morning's
briefing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  What's come up since she saw us this morning when we were feeding
the bottomless pits," added Buffy.  She had finished
dressing with a heavy linen and wool dress over her shift and was sitting
down, pulling up long wool stockings.</p>

<p>"She just wanted to sit with the two of you to go over your plan, Willow,"
said Aiofe, "she has a few more questions."</p>

<p>"Relaxation waits," said Willow, -sorry lover.-</p>

<p>-It's ok.  I'll get you later.-</p>

<p>The three young women headed back to the inn, and reconvened with Amana
and Grael in Willow's workroom.  The workroom had undergone some additional
renovations, and now more fully reflected
Willow's character.  It had been painted in bright cheery
colours, and had had several linen prints plastered onto the
walls, creating the effect of large textured paintings or murals.  One
corner of the room had been converted into a nursery for the two babies,
and that section had bright cartoon animals painted
onto the walls, near to the floor.  They arranged for breakfast
to be brought for them, and began the daily briefing session once it
had arrived.  Willow had opted to start the briefing with only the five
of them, and would continue later with the full group.</p>

<p>"Ok," said Willow, "I understand that you want to go over things a bit
more."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Amana, "I have a few questions."</p>

<p>"No problem," said the arch-mage, as she spread jam onto a
buttered scone, "I'd rather we have all the angles covered rather than
forget something important later."</p>

<p>"Why don't we go over everything," said Buffy, "just to make sure everyone
is comfortable."</p>

<p>"Yes, why don't we," said Bridie, as she entered the room
carrying two little girls, who were awake and looking for their
parents.</p>

<p>"What's up sweetie," said Buffy, taking Faith from Bridie's arms, "are
you still hungry?"</p>

<p>Faith looked up at her mother and smiled, her cobalt-blue eyes
dancing with reflected light, and curiosity.</p>

<p>"Don't think they're hungry," said Bridie, sitting down at the
table and pouring herself a glass of milk, after passing Kendra
to her mother, "I think that they are just awake and want to be
where the action is."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good," said Willow, cuddling her daughter and
walking over to the nursery area, "why don't we put you two in
your crib here and you can watch your mommies, while they eat."</p>

<p>Minutes later everyone reconvened around the table.  Willow
waited until they were all settled, with food and drink before
them, and then said, "ok, to continue.  After the solstice I
finally put together all the bits and pieces that have been
running through my mind for the last six months or so, and I
think that I have a permanent solution to the hell-mouth problem, at
least on this world."</p>

<p>"So much you have already told us," said Grael, "however, you
have been a little sparse on the details."</p>

<p>"Except for the part about sending out the new slayers on a
search mission," added Amana.</p>

<p>"I need them to find as many mages as possible," said Willow,
"preferably second or third degree, but I'll make due with anyone who
has power, and some training."</p>

<p>"Why's that," asked Aiofe.</p>

<p>"I got the idea, and the need for the additional mages," said
Willow, "based on what we have found out about the hell-mouths.  First,
they are used both as a transportation network, and as a
method for transmitting energy.  Second, they have been created, or are
being exploited, by demons many realities removed from
this one.  Third, the demons have to maintain this network.  And, fourth,
the demons are directly affected when one of them are
closed."</p>

<p>"Ok," said Buffy, "I'll bite.  What is this leading to?"</p>

<p>"I think that I've figured out a way to short circuit the hell-
mouths," said Willow.</p>

<p>Her statement was met with incredulous looks from around the
table.</p>

<p>"How," whispered Amana, "and what do you mean by short-
circuiting?"</p>

<p>"Well," began Willow, "it has to do with overloading the
circuit."  Seeing questioning looks from everyone except Buffy,
Willow then said, "energy as it flows from one point to another, using
a transportation medium, can be described as a circuit.
Each circuit has a limit to how much it can carry, and to what
type of energy it can carry.  What I'm going to attempt to do is to is
overload one section of the circuit, thereby, I hope,
causing a feedback loop which should overload all of it."</p>

<p>"Come again," asked Aiofe, still not too clear on the details.</p>

<p>"The way I figure it, the actual hell-mouths are massive energy
collectors in the magical realm, and to a lesser extent here in
the physical world.  Because of this, they will have been heavily shielded
by the demon's who created them, and therefore very
difficult to overload, as demonstrated when I closed the hell-
mouth last spring.  However, because they are used as part of a
transportation network, they must be linked to each other, using some
form of energy conduit.  The effort to shield those links
would be prohibitive, both in effort and in energy, so what I'm
going to do is hack into the network in the middle of one of
these links, then funnel a huge amount of energy through the
break.  This should result in the whole network overloading as
the power surge attacks each hell-mouth from within."</p>

<p>"Cool," said Buffy, who was aware of Willow's prodigious
abilities with hacking into computer networks, "sort of like a
computer virus."</p>

<p>"How?  What," asked Grael.</p>

<p>"That is where the additional mages come in," replied the arch-
mage, choosing to respond to Grael's first question, "I am going to need
them to help collect the energy, store it and then funnel it to me once
I've breached the network.  Some of them will also act as my anchors,
and others I will use to maintain protections around what I will be doing,
so that I don't end up wiping out
half the mountains when I start playing with that much energy, or for
that matter wipe myself out in a feedback loop."</p>

<p>"Hence your need for Sonya and the rest to find as many mages as possible,"
said Bridie.</p>

<p>"Yep," replied Willow, "The way I figure it, I'm going to need a full
triple circle, with at least half of the members initiated
mages."</p>

<p>Just as Willow was finishing the remaining members of her command group
came into the workroom to begin the morning briefing.
After everyone had grabbed drinks and places around the table
Willow began the meeting by saying, "Morning all.  For those of
you just joining, what you've missed is some additional
explanations on why I'm sending out Sonya to find mages.  If you want
the details, I'll be glad to fill you in later."</p>

<p>Willow proceeded with the rest of the morning's agenda.
Finishing the meeting an hour later, she said, "ok, that's it
then.  Daithi, would you insure that Sonya and the rest are
properly outfitted and provisioned.  I would like to see them on their
way by lunch time."</p>

<p>"No problem," said Daithi, rising from the table and heading out of the
room.</p>

<p>"One other thing."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, turning back from the door.</p>

<p>"Could you ask Sonya to come by in an hour or so.  I'm going to
feed Kendra and then I'd like to brief Sonya on a few last minute things
before they leave."</p>

<p>"Ok," said Daithi as he left the room.</p>

<p>The remaining members of the command group also left to begin
their day.  Aiofe and Grael to help get the search group
organized, Frankel to continue his work writing an essay on
slayers and slaying.  Aiofe and Bridie remained seated at the
table; their main job continued to be insuring that neither Buffy nor
Willow over exerted themselves.</p>

<p>Buffy remained sitting at the table, across from her friend and
lover, and said, "this going to work?"</p>

<p>"Have faith."</p>

<p>"Had Faith," replied Buffy with a smile.</p>

<p>"Buffy," said Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Would you mind answering a question for me?"</p>

<p>"Ask, and I'll tell you if I mind."</p>

<p>"It's just that we," said Aiofe indicating herself and her lover, "were
wondering how you decided on the names for your daughters."</p>

<p>Buffy looked across the table at Willow and asked, -do you want
to handle this?-</p>

<p>-Nope, you can field this one.-</p>

<p>Buffy stood up from the table and walked over to the crib where
her daughters were lying, staring through the bars.  She picked
up the children, and holding one in each arm retuned to the table and
sat down.  She paused, collected her thoughts and then said, "it's a
long story."</p>

<p>Buffy then went on to explain how she and Willow had decided on
naming their daughters Kendra and Faith.  She began by describing the
people that the girls had been named for.  Buffy started by
telling how Kendra had been called to Sunnydale as a slayer, when it
had appeared that she had died.  How for a while there were
two slayers, and then how Kendra had been killed.  Buffy then
explained what had happened with Faith.  How she had come to
Sunnydale as a slayer, and how she had turned from helping Buffy into
being an enemy.  How she had fallen into a coma, and what
had happened just prior to Willow's acceptance to come and help
this world.</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>Having described the people that their daughters were named for, Buffy
then went on to explain why they had chosen them as name
sources for their daughters.  She indicated that both Faith and
Kendra, the slayers, had had terrible lives.  They had never had the
opportunities for a real life, either by being forced from an early life
into slayer training, or by growing up in an abusive
family.  Buffy explained that the pain that the two women had
grown up in had distressed both her and Willow.  They had
therefore decided to name their daughters after them, to try to
'rehabilitate' the names, by giving their daughters the love,
support and care that neither Faith nor Kendra had had.</p>

<p>"Rehabilitate," asked Aiofe, curiosity evident in her voice, "why do
names need to be rehabilitated?"</p>

<p>"It's just that some of the people we know back home have a
problem with the name Faith," said Willow, "especially after what she
did to us, and Buffy wanted to try to bring back some respect and honour
to the name."</p>

<p>"And Kendra never had a chance back home," added Buffy, "she
missed everything in her childhood, and when she was a teenager, things
that I got to experience.  So this is our attempt to bring back the
balance."</p>

<p>Both Kendra and Faith chose that moment to decide that they
needed changing, attention and a meal, and began to fuss and
wail.</p>

<p>"Mommy time," said Willow, reaching across the table to pick up
her fussy daughter, "Aiofe," she said, "would you be a dear and
bring over some diapers?"</p>

<p>Both young mothers then set about their now routine task of
cleaning their daughters and settling them down to the breast.
Willow had just finished Kendra on one side and was in the
process of burping her, before offering the other breast, when
there was a discreet knock on the door to the workroom.</p>

<p>Willow looked up at Bridie with a 'can you get that,' in her
eyes.  Bridie opened the door to admit Sonya.</p>

<p>"Is now a good time, Willow," asked Sonya.  Buffy's twin had
filled out over the past four months.  Her muscles showed the
effort of the constant exercise, training and good nutrition that she
had experienced.  While she was still a far cry from Buffy in her prime,
especially with the enhancements precipitated by Buffy being initiated
as the Goddess's Avatar, she was a formidable
young woman.</p>

<p>"No problem, Sonya," said Willow, "why don't you grab a drink
from the sideboard over there and sit.  We can talk while I
finish up with Kendra here."</p>

<p>Once Sonya had settled, Willow then said, "I just wanted to take some
time to chat before you left, to make sure you were
comfortable with everything."</p>

<p>"I think we're ready, we have the supplies we need, and have been fully
outfitted with arms and armour," replied Sonya, "I do have a question
or two though."</p>

<p>"Ask away."</p>

<p>"I know what and why we are going out looking for other mages, at least
in the context of our mission.  However, I'm not too clear on the why
now, in the middle of winter."</p>

<p>Willow spent a moment collecting her thoughts, saying to Buffy,
-perceptive isn't she?-  She covered the pause by settling her
daughter back on the breast and then replied, "you are the first to ask.
I haven't discussed this yet with any of the others."</p>

<p>Buffy, Bridie and Aiofe perked up at Willow's words, and drew
their chairs closer to the table, as if to be as close to the
arch-mage's words as possible.</p>

<p>"And," said Sonya.</p>

<p>"I think we are running out of time," said Willow.</p>

<p>"How's that," asked Aiofe.</p>

<p>"In my meditations, and spirit travel, I've noticed a massive
increase in demon activities lately, not more than two or three
weeks or so from here.  I think that Amana and Grael's humanity
in letting Hugh go free has given too many clues as to our
whereabouts to the demon leadership."</p>

<p>"Are we in immediate danger," asked Bridie, the concern in her
voice mirrored in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Not just yet, I don't think," replied Willow, "but I foresee
that we will be visited by the demons before the end of winter."</p>

<p>"Major bummer," said Buffy.</p>

<p>"That is why I need you to move as quick as you can, Sonya,"
continued Willow, "and to get back here before the end of January at
the latest."</p>

<p>"Five weeks or so," said Sonya, contemplating this new
information, and answering the question she had on the amount of supplies
she had been given; also thinking about how the time
pressure would affect her search for mages.  "Do you have any
suggestions on how I should proceed?"</p>

<p>"I think that you should get down the mountain as fast as you
can," said Willow, "and get as close to the capital as possible, without
attracting any attention from the demons who have laid
siege to it.  Once you are there, establish a base in one of the surrounding
towns and then seek out as many of the mages as you
can, and get back here.  You know that I can use all the
experienced people you can find, but at a minimum, I need you to find
eighteen.  Amana and Grael have arranged for you to carry
extra food, clothing and other items, to be used as you see fit
as trade goods, either for the mages I need, or for bribes."</p>

<p>"I won't fail you, Lady," said Sonya, getting up from the table
and heading to the door, "you have my word on that."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Willow gently, "finish getting ready.  I'll see you
all just before you head out."</p>

<p>Once Sonya had left the room, closing the door behind her, Willow sighed
and said rhetorically, "we are the same age, but why do I feel so much
older?"</p>

<p>"Motherhood, and responsibility," said Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow sighed again and said, "I know, it just gets to me
sometimes.  But, can't change the past."</p>

<p>Willow stood up from the table, cuddling her nearly asleep
daughter, and said, "it's nearly time to see them off.  What do
we do with our cuddle monsters, take them upstairs, or leave them here?"</p>

<p>"Leave them here," said Buffy, heading over to the crib, "we are going
to want to come back after and plan our Christmas Eve,
remember?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't forget that," said Willow, joining her spouse in
settling their daughters.</p>

<p>"Christmas," asked Aiofe.</p>

<p>"We'll fill you in over lunch, promise," said Buffy as they left the
workroom to bid farewell to the slayers.</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>Down the mountains, in the demon master's command centre there
was a noticeable increase in the work being performed.  More work than
could be explained by the continued offensive against the
human inhabitants of this world.  Numerous demons were busy
examining and updating operational charts for various aspects of the
war, in addition to receiving and relaying movement orders to the different
demon armies under the control of this lord.  If
the charts were examined closely, it would be obvious that a
significant amount of his resources were being expended in the
mountains to the north, far from any significant concentration of human
forces.</p>

<p>The atmosphere in the room chilled perceptibly when the demon
master entered.</p>

<p>"Report," he barked to one of his senior lieutenants.</p>

<p>"Nothing so far my lord," said a yellow skinned demon, who was
standing in front of the main operations map.</p>

<p>"That is not good enough," said the commander, as he strode
towards the map, "what can you tell me?'</p>

<p>"Using the point where we found Hugh as a starting point, and
estimating that he had travelled for two weeks before we found
him, we have laid out a search grid."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"Also assuming that the human scum misdirected him by moving him north
before dropping him off, we have started our searching in
the area to the south of where he was found."</p>

<p>"Good assumption, but you are saying that you have found nothing yet."</p>

<p>"That is correct, lord.  But it is still early days.  We are
continuing our sweep northward, and we will find them."</p>

<p>"How long," asked the demon walking to his throne and sitting
down, "before we are done?"</p>

<p>"We should reach the northern most point, here, in about six
weeks," replied the lieutenant, placing his hand directly on the valley
where the village of Morning Breeze was located.</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>Later that afternoon, after they had bid farewell to Sonya and
the rest of the young women travelling with her, Willow and Buffy were
back in the arch-mage's workroom, in the middle of an
animated conversation.</p>

<p>"Eggnog," said Buffy, "surely we can find someone who can make
eggnog."</p>

<p>"Eggnog," asked Aiofe, "what is eggnog?"</p>

<p>"Sugar, spices, milk and egg yolks," said Buffy, "beaten together and
then served with whipped cream and booze."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," said Willow, "what else.  I know... we can get
Daithi and the boys to get a tree."</p>

<p>"Pudding, turkey, and yams," continued Buffy, rattling off her
Christmas dinner wish list, "I'm off to the kitchens.  Care to
join me, Bridie?"</p>

<p>Bridie stood up and followed the slayer out of the workroom with a wordless
glance of confusion back to her lover.</p>

<p>"I know," said Aiofe, "but it sounds like it will be a fun party, anyways."</p>

<p>"That is will be," said Willow.  "Now, we need to think of
decorations.  We can use pine boughs, and cranberries on string
to decorate the common room."</p>

<p>"Why all the fuss," asked Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Back on our world, the general population condenses the
traditional twelve nights into a single night and day."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, it basically has to do with religion.  The dominant
religion where we come from usurped many of the traditions of the Goddess,
to help bring the population in line, once they had
taken over the leadership of a country.  It gave the people a
sense of continuity with their old practices and beliefs."</p>

<p>"Who were these people?"</p>

<p>"They existed here too at one time," replied Willow, "the
Christians."</p>

<p>"But they fell out of favour centuries ago," said Aiofe, "and
they were never that big to begin with."</p>

<p>"How did that happen," asked Willow, her curiosity about the
differences between this world and her own now fully engaged,
"Frankel indicated that your world went through the same basic
history as mine did, up until a hundred years or so ago."</p>

<p>"Basic yes," replied Aiofe, "however, there were some major
differences in the social / political history between our
worlds."</p>

<p>"But wouldn't that have affected the general history?"</p>

<p>"I think that, the more we look at this multiple world business, the
more we will find that the major trends remain the same,
driven by economic and societal pressures.  However, I think that there
are differences in the 'seasonings', or specific political and perhaps
religious factors on each world."</p>

<p>"So on this world, the Christians never gained the political and religious
stranglehold that they did on mine then?"</p>

<p>"The followers of Jesus did make their influence felt, for about four
hundred years after his death.  But once they tried to
aggressively expand into the Celtic countries they ran into
serious resistance, and were beaten back by followers of the
Goddess, who rose up under inspired and some say Devine,
leadership.  The various leaders of the Celtic nations then
banded together and decided to sweep Europe free of Christians
once and for all, feeling that they were an intolerant sect and
would only cause future trouble."</p>

<p>"What about the reformation and the age of enlightenment then?"</p>

<p>"Once the Celts had swept Europe clean of Christians, their
nations fell into darkness and superstition, based on old tribal infighting
and mistrust of non-northern peoples.  The progress
that had been made to that point fell apart, and disease and war swept
repeatedly through Europe.  Mohamed rose in the desert, and formed the
faith of Allah, and they, the Jewish nations and the
great tribal nations of Asia clashed repeatedly with the Celts,
and each other, for hundreds of years.  It was only with the rise of
the great Celtic nations in France, Spain, England and Germany at the
end of the fifteenth century that true exploration and
scientific progress began."</p>

<p>"Close to our history, but with a couple of significant
differences."</p>

<p>"I understand that once the recent ice-age hit, most of Europe,
Asia Minor and the Arab nations were over-run with famines and
the old, bitter, feuds rose up again.  They were also inundated
with refugees fleeing the ice, causing renewed fighting between
the Celts and the Arabs.  The entire area is a wasteland of war
and pestilence now.  The demons would have had no problems taking over
there, it was practically a nightmare on earth before this
current war started."</p>

<p>"What happened with exploration on this continent then," asked
Willow, fascinated by this impromptu, and brief, history lesson.</p>

<p>"Well," said Aiofe, "the English and the Spanish led most of the great
waves of exploration, in this, the new world.  However,
once they had restarted their wars in Europe they essentially cut off
the colonies here, and we were left to fend for ourselves."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"Well, the colonies gradually spread west and south, settling as they
went, until they finally reached the west coast around the
end of the nineteenth century."</p>

<p>"What of the native inhabitants.  I noticed that I haven't seen
many overtly native people around."</p>

<p>"For the most part they were gradually absorbed into the European
communities,
and their racial uniqueness melted into the whole."</p>

<p>"So you never had the Indian wars, and the near genocide of the
native people then."</p>

<p>"Goddess, no.  Our way is, and has always been, accommodation.
Frankly, without the natives, the small colonies that had been
established would have perished, once trade with Europe had been cut
off and once the ice-age had really settled in."</p>

<p>"One more difference between us, making our world and its history look
bad in comparison," said Willow, "however, fascinating as
this has been, it isn't getting us any closer to our celebration tonight."</p>

<p>"What can we do to get ready?"</p>

<p>"Well, with Buff taking over the kitchen duties, I guess we are
on decoration patrol.  Let's go find Grael and Daithi and see if we can
get a tree and some boughs."</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent in frenzied activity, as
everyone in the inn got involved in the impromptu Christmas
celebration.  If anyone had questions as to why two followers of the
Goddess were so concerned about celebrating an old Christian holiday,
they kept them to themselves.  Everyone knew that new
mothers often had weird, unexplainable, mood shifts and cravings.  It
was best to accommodate their desires, rather than risk any
unpleasant consequences from the mothers falling into the baby
blues.</p>

<p>By supper time the common room of the inn had been transformed
into a festive party room, with the addition of a large blue
spruce tree, which had been decorated with garlands of
cranberries, ornaments of silver paper and several small wooden
carvings.  The walls, and mantles had been festooned with pine
boughs, adding their distinctive scent to the room.  The floors
had been swept, and washed, before being rinsed with water
infused with several essential oils.  The fires had all been
built up, and were crackling, adding their cheery light to the
room.  The three large chandlers had had their oil refilled and
were all burning merrily.</p>

<p>The weather outside could have been more hospitable however.
Just as everyone was sitting down to their dinner of turkey,
goose, stuffing and various vegetables a bitter north wind sprung up,
bringing with it the start of a massive snowfall that would
last for the next two and a half weeks.</p>

<p>Willow looked around at everyone, warm and comfortable, and
enjoying their dinner and had a moment of regret.  Turning to
Amana she said, "I feel guilty.  Here we are, having a nice
dinner, safe and warm."</p>

<p>"Why does that cause you concern?"</p>

<p>"Well... Sonya and the others.  I sent them out into this storm."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Willow.  You know that they were planning to stay
at one of the farms down the mountain.  They will be safe there, and
they all have enough sense to ride out the worst of the storm before
continuing their mission."</p>

<p>"But...."</p>

<p>"No buts, dear.  Besides, this celebration is for you and Buffy.  Sonya
and the others did not know about it before they left, and would not
be expecting it.  It is totally removed from their
experience.  They will spend tonight in the traditional manner."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Amana."</p>

<p>"I am, now enjoy your party."</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>Later that evening, well after the party had finally wound down, Buffy
and Willow had just finishing feeding, and settling, their daughters,
and were getting ready to go to bed themselves.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas, sweetie," said Buffy, coming up from behind and embracing
her spouse.</p>

<p>"You too," said Willow, leaning back and melting into Buffy's
chest.</p>

<p>"Goddess, you are tense, aren't you."</p>

<p>"Lots on my mind."</p>

<p>"I've got a way to help you unwind."</p>

<p>"Do you now," said Willow as she turned in her lover's arms, -and what
would that be?-</p>

<p>-You know me better than that.-</p>

<p>-I do, but... just what did you have in that dirty mind of ours?-</p>

<p>-I thought that you'd like a massage.  I've got some nice oil to work
into your skin.-</p>

<p>-That is so tempting.-</p>

<p>-Then give in.-</p>

<p>-I think I will,- replied the arch-mage, as she began to trail
her finger-tips along her lover's neck, -after all, who know
where a massage might lead.-</p>

<p>"And you claim that I have a perverted mind.  Now lets get naked, and
into bed."</p>

<p>"Goodie."</p>

<p>Within minutes Buffy was gently massaging her lover's back and
shoulders.</p>

<p>"These muscles are all knotted up," she said.</p>

<p>Buffy poured a little oil into her hands, and then rubbed them
together to warm up the oil.  She then began to work the oil into Willow's
muscles.</p>

<p>"That is so nice," said Willow, as she began to relax under the
skilled hands of her spouse.</p>

<p>The knots and tension in Willow's back muscles began to dissolve as Buffy
continued with her massage.  Once she had finished
working on the shoulders Buffy then began to work her way down
her lover's back, taking her time, and making sure to work each
muscle group on the way.  Willow continued her contented sighing at the
attention she was receiving and whimpered in objection
when Buffy stopped for a moment.</p>

<p>"Turn over love."</p>

<p>"Mmmm.  Do I have to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sloth girl, you do."</p>

<p>Willow, reluctantly, turned over on the bed, and looked up at the deep
jade-green pools, which were her lover's eyes.  Eyes that
were currently boring holes into her skull.</p>

<p>"Know what you want, I do."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>With that, Willow reached up and pulled Buffy down into a deep
embrace, crushing Buffy against her body.  She continued the
kiss, as she began to move her hands along Buffy's back and
sides.    Reaching her lover's behind, she grasped each check,
squeezed, and pushed upwards then pulled down, resulting in their pelvises
grinding into each other.</p>

<p>-Oh, yes,- exclaimed Buffy, as the sexual tension of the moment
began to quicken her breath, and her heart rate.</p>

<p>-You like?-</p>

<p>-Just let me show you how much,- Buffy proceeded to snake one of her
hands down between their bodies, on a direct course for
Willow's clit.  Reaching her target, she grasped Willow's button between
her thumb and index finger and began to gently twist;
while her forefinger flicked across the top of her lover's clit.</p>

<p>Willow, who had already been in a state of heightened excitement due
to the massage, began to buck and squirm, which had the
result of grinding her leg even harder into Buffy's pelvis.  This
simultaneous
grinding and manipulating had the desired result as both young women
exploded in orgasm.   Pausing for a moment to
admire her sweat covered spouse, Buffy then began to lick her way down
Willow's body, making sure to remove all beads of
perspiration.  She paid particular attention to Willow's engorged breasts,
first licking them clean, then gently sucking on each
nipple, being rewarded with a taste of warm milk.</p>

<p>"That tastes so good," Buffy commented, before continuing her
slow, slow, oral journey towards her obvious goal.</p>

<p>She traced long trails along Willow's stomach with her tongue,
she teased Willow's bellybutton and she gently kissed each of the pale
stretch marks along her lover's abdomen, before gently
prying Willow's legs apart.</p>

<p>Moving between those legs, Buffy paused for a moment and said, "I see
that I have a lot of work to do here."</p>

<p>Buffy alternately, and slowly, licked along the insides of each
of Willow's legs, moving ever closer to her lover's cleft.  As
she approached her goal, she began to gently nip at soft flesh at the
top of Willow's thighs, causing her spouse to gasp in
pleasure with each bite.  Finally, Buffy began her assault on the centre
of Willow's pleasure.  She began with long licks, from the top of her
lover's slit, paying close attention to the little
button, to the bottom, spending some time to run her tongue
around the edge of Willow's vaginal opening.  Buffy then
alternated licks, with gentle bites, up and down Willow's sex,
creating waves of pleasure and pain to course through her body.  The
arch-mage began to buck in pleasure, trying to move her
clitoris into Buffy's mouth, for direct stimulation from her
lover's tongue and teeth.</p>

<p>-Please, please, please,- Willow whimpered in their mind, -this
is so good.  Don't stop.-</p>

<p>-Not planning to,- replied Buffy, as she grabbed one of Willow's inner
labia with her teeth, and bit gently on it, -now does that feel nice?-</p>

<p>Receiving only an incoherent whimper in reply, Buffy continued
her lovemaking by running her tongue along the edge of the labia she
had between her teeth.  She then used one hand to open the
folds of her lover's cleft, before she plunged her tongue deep
into Willow's vagina.  As she orally assaulted Willow's love
canal, Buffy began to rub Willow's clitoris in a circular
pattern.  Willow, already near the edge, was not able to hold out for
very long; within minutes she began to tremble, then her
entire body stiffened as she climaxed.  Buffy rode out her
lover's climax, not stopping her oral, and physical lovemaking.  Willow,
never dropped out of her peak, just as she began to relax from her orgasm,
Buffy's ministrations caused her to peak again.  This continued for nearly
half an hour, as Buffy caused numerous waves of orgasmic pleasure to
course through Willow.</p>

<p>Later, after heartbeat had returned to near normal, Willow
reached down and pulled her lover up from between her legs into
an embrace.</p>

<p>Kissing her gently, and tasting herself on Buffy's lips and
tongue, Willow said, &lt;thank you.  I would be lost without you.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy, snuggled deep in her spouse's arms, suddenly noticed that Willow
was weeping.  Brushing away the tears, she said, "what's
wrong.  It wasn't that bad, was it?"</p>

<p>"It isn't you."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?  You know that I'm always here for you."</p>

<p>"I miss them."</p>

<p>Understanding then came to the slayer.  Willow was homesick.
Stroking Willow's long red hair Buffy said softly, "I miss them
too."</p>

<p>"It's just that it's been nearly a year now.  Mom and Dad must be frantic
with worry, no matter what Giles and the others told
them."</p>

<p>"It'll be ok, love.  We will be home soon, and then we can
explain everything.  There will be a lot to explain, however."</p>

<p>"Your Mom will also be going nuts.  Doesn't that worry you?"</p>

<p>"It does.  But, I have put that, and everything else to do with
my worries about getting home, into that little spot in my mind
where I put the unthinkable.  So it won't distract me."</p>

<p>"That's fine for you, lover, but what about me.  I don't know if we will
even survive the winter, let alone ever get home again."</p>

<p>"We will survive; and we will get home.  I have total faith in
you and your abilities."</p>

<p>"That makes one of us then."</p>

<p>"Chill, Will.  Don't get down on yourself.  You will worry this
to death, and that will only upset you more.  Fate has put us in this
position, and you will get us out.  Just remember what you
have done already."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I got you, me and the cat stranded on a different world."</p>

<p>"You have also saved my life, come into your power, married me,
impregnated two women, and produced a beautiful baby."</p>

<p>Willow sniffed back her tears, and said, "I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I know so.  Now, lets dry your face, and get some sleep.  If the twins
are up to their usual tricks, they will be looking for food in a couple
of hours or so."</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>The next three weeks flew by, as Willow and the rest of her team prepared
for the anticipated return of Sonya, the slayers and any  mages that
they had been able to find.  They had not heard from
the group since they had left; however, Willow was not worried.  She
knew that the harsh January weather, combined with a war,
would reduce the ability of Sonya to send anyone back with word
on her progress.  Nevertheless, everyone else did not share
Willow's equanimity about the situation.</p>

<p>Willow, Buffy, Aiofe, Bridie and the babies were sitting before
one of the fireplaces in the common room, enjoying a post-dinner drink.
Buffy, who had been agitating about the lack of news from Sonya all day,
continued her harangue by saying, "Damn it, Will, we have to know what
is happing.  We don't have that much time
until the date you told them to return by, and we've heard
nothing from them."</p>

<p>"No news, could be good news," said Aiofe.</p>

<p>"No news could be they're dead news," retorted Buffy, leaping up from
the sofa where she had been sitting with Willow, and
beginning to pace back and forth in front of the fire.</p>

<p>"Chill, Buff," said Willow, "I know you are woman of action, but, what
can I do.  They are either on their way back, or not.  Not
much I can do to influence things one way or the other."</p>

<p>"But," said Buffy, as she ceased her pacing and returned to her
seat, "oh, I don't know, it's just this feeling I've had all day, that
they are in trouble."</p>

<p>"Now that, love, is something we can deal with," said Willow,
realizing as she got up from the sofa and began to walk towards
her workroom that her lover may have been experiencing more than lack
of action jitters, "follow me ladies, and lets see if my
spouse has 'seen' or is just being a nervous Nelly."</p>

<p>Shortly they had all convened in the workroom, everyone else
sitting at the worktable while Willow busied herself by pulling
various items out of cabinets and off of shelves.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "I need you Buffy to give me a hand, and lets
just try to figure out what's been bothering you all day, and if it has
its basis in reality, or in your imagination."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and joined Willow at the far end of the worktable, where
she had laid out a bowl full of spring water, a brazier, a sharp knife,
some incense and a crystal.  Willow lit the brazier, and dropped a cone
of incense into it, resulting in the scent of jasmine and lavender
permeating
throughout the room.</p>

<p>Willow turned to Buffy and said, "now love, I'm going to take a
small amount of blood from you, and use it and the crystal to try to
see what you may have been foretelling in your subconscious,
thus causing the agitation that you have been so pleasantly
expressing all day."</p>

<p>Willow began by placing the crystal at the bottom of the bowl;
she then said a few words, resulting in the water becoming
cloudy, with a counter clockwise current swirling in the bowl.
She then grasped Buffy's hand, and sliced along the palm.  She
then dribbled the blood that sprung up from the cut into the
water; as each drop hit the water it swirled along with the
current, and gradually cleared the water.  Once the water had
cleared completely, Willow stopped the blood flow from Buffy's
hand.</p>

<p>"Now," said Willow, "lets see what we see."</p>

<p>Willow, closed her eyes, spread her hands over the bowl and began to
meditate.  Aiofe and Bridie stood up and joined Buffy as the
three of them watched the water carefully for any indication of
success on Willow's part.</p>

<p>Within minutes, the water became opaque again, and began to swirl violently
in the bowl.  Suddenly Willow clapped her hands and
shouted, "ashlaghey ry-heet firriney!"</p>

<p>The result was instantaneous; the cloudy water immediately began to show
a picture.  It was of a valley not far down the mountain, where it appeared
that a large force of demons, nearly a hundred, were attacking a small
group of humans.  Willow stared at the
vision, and caused it to focus in on the humans.</p>

<p>"Goddess," whispered Aiofe, when the faces of the humans became
visible, "its Sonya and the others."</p>

<p>"I think you and Daithi are going for a trip, Buffy," said
Willow, as she dismissed the vision in the bowl, "and I think you are
leaving in the morning."</p>

<p>"I think you're right," said the slayer, "I just hope I'll be in time."</p>

<p>"You will," replied Willow, "this is a vision of what is to come, not
what is or has happened.  However, you don't have a lot of
time."</p>

<p>"Come," said Bridie, "lets all to bed.  We've an early start in
the morning."</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>The next morning, well before dawn, Willow, Bridie, Aiofe and the twins
had assembled in the common room to bid farewell to Buffy
and Daithi.</p>

<p>"You all set," asked Willow, looking over her spouse and the
Guards captain.  Both were dressed in heavy winter clothing.</p>

<p>"I feel like an Inuit," said Buffy, referring to her clothing.</p>

<p>After eating a hasty breakfast, followed by an equally quick
bath, Buffy had fed Faith before getting dressed for her
expedition.  Thin cotton underwear, covering her from neck to
toes, was in turn covered by a set of wool clothing that also ran from
neck to ankles.  A second layer of cotton clothing in turn, covered this
layer.  Finally, Buffy had dressed in a thick hooded fur coat and pants,
both of which had the fur layer turned
inwards; the furs had been bleached a camouflaging white.  Over a second
pair of cotton socks Buffy wore a thick pair of waterproof leather boots,
which were laced up to mid calf.  She had put on a wool balaclava, and
was carrying a second hat, which she would
put on just before leaving.  Her hands were already in her thin
cotton gloves, she would wait until she left before putting on
the thick fur mittens.</p>

<p>"Let's cut this short," said Daithi, "Buffy and I are already
getting overheated, we don't want to sweat too much before going out
into the cold."</p>

<p>"I agree," said the slayer, "now where is my darling, so I can
give her a kiss goodbye?"</p>

<p>"Right here," said Bridie, holding up Faith, for a hug and kiss
from her mother, "don't worry, she'll be fine."</p>

<p>"I know," said Buffy, holding back a tear.  Looking down at the
little girl in her arms she said," I will miss you sweetie.  Be a good
girl, and I'll be back in four days or so."</p>

<p>As Buffy returned her daughter to Bridie, she said, "take care of her,
please."</p>

<p>"I will," replied Bridie.</p>

<p>Buffy then turned and embraced Willow in a bear hug.  After a few minutes
she said, -take care love.-</p>

<p>-I will.  Don't worry about me, just find Sonya and the others as fast
as you can.-</p>

<p>-That I will do.  Do you realize that this is the first time
we've been apart since last Christmas?-</p>

<p>-I do, and that doesn't make it any easier.  Now, be careful, and don't
get into any needless fights now, please.-</p>

<p>-I won't.-</p>

<p>Buffy kissed her spouse, tousled her long red hair, and said, "be good.
I'll be back in five days, tops."</p>

<p>"I will.  You two take care.  No heroics, and get back as fast as you
can.  We cannot afford to lose either of you.  This morning's forecast,
if we can trust Frankel, said that we're going to have awful weather
for the next week, no snow but bitter cold."</p>

<p>"Lets hope that it'll slow the demons more than us, Willow," said Daithi,
as he gathered up his backpack and settled it onto his
shoulders, "now, lets be off, we have a long walk before we can
get to any shelter for tonight."</p>

<p>"You're right," said Buffy, also grabbing her pack and making her final
preparations, "lets go."</p>

<p>Buffy and Daithi then left the inn, opening the door to the
remnants of the winter storm, which had struck overnight.
Wearing their white clothing, it wasn't long before the snow
whirling around the pre-dawn sky swallowed them.</p>

<p>Willow, Bridie and Aiofe watched from the door, braving the cold, until
they could no longer see either Buffy or Daithi.  One by
one they turned from the door, Willow being the last, and
returned to the chairs before one of the fireplaces.</p>

<p>"That's that then," said Willow, she sipped from her mug of
mulled cider and after a moment's pause continued, "I hate this."</p>

<p>"What, love," asked Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Sending people into danger."</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>In the demon lord's war room, things were getting tense for the
various members of his command staff.  It had been over three
weeks, and the various groups of demon scouts had not yet found
any sign of the slayer and her companions.  The army that was
waiting to strike was getting restless after weeks of inaction;
things were beginning to come to the boil.</p>

<p>The master was sitting on his throne, surveying the work being
performed by his subordinates and reading various dispatches,
when one of his lieutenants approached him and bowed deeply.  He looked
up from the dispatch he was reading and said, "yes?  What is it?"</p>

<p>"We have just received new intelligence, Lord."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"One of our outlying tracking forces has picked up the trail of a large
group of humans, heading north from the capital towards the area where
the demon Hugh was found."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"More than thirty, lord.  They are moving slowly and our forces
should be in a position to intercept by tomorrow at the latest."</p>

<p>"Good," said the demon master, "that many humans moving towards a sparsely
inhabited region can only be the work of the slayer.
Make sure that we capture at least half of them, so that we can
find out where they were going."</p>

<p>"As you will, lord."</p>

<p>"One other thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Get the army moving north.  I have a feeling that we will be
finding our answers, soon."</p>

<p>"It will be done."</p>

<p>The lieutenant bowed, and turned away from the demon lord.</p>

<p>The demon master put down the reports that he had been reading
and thought, "soon, soon I will have her eliminated; and the
threat she poses to me will be gone."</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>For Sonya, and the other slayers, the last three weeks had been
successful, if not enjoyable.  They had trekked for nine days
through a winter storm before they had reached one of the small
outlining towns that were around the capital.  The town had been blasted,
by the demon army that overran it, and was now a
collection of burnt-out shells.  The pitiful remnants of the
human population lived like rats in the runes, scurrying out of
sight at the slightest sound, for fear of the demons returning to enslave
them, like they had enslaved the rest of the town's
survivors.  Sonya had noticed, peripherally, the scurrying as she and
the others approached the ruins.  She decided that time was
no longer on her side and was definitely not available to her for a long
search through the town; She therefore took up residence
in one of the least destroyed buildings, and waited for the
inhabitants to come to her, as she knew they eventually would.</p>

<p>They settled into their temporary camp by setting up a campfire, sleeping
and storage areas, and by posting sentries at all of the openings to
the structure; an hour later Sonya was rewarded when she was told that
there was someone approaching the building.
Sonya went to a gaping hole in one of the blackened walls, and
carefully looked out, to see the emissary from the survivors of
the town.  She saw a small girl, no more than ten, carefully
picking her way through the rubble towards the newcomers.</p>

<p>Inwardly seething at the callousness of other humans, for using a little
girl as a stalking horse, she waited until the girl was no more than
ten meters away from the blasted door of the house
before saying softly, "It's ok.  We won't hurt you.  We've come
for information, and some help."</p>

<p>The girl slowly moved closer to the building her eyes constantly darting
from side to side, as if she could see through stone,
saying nothing.  She stopped about three meters from the door.
Sonya, moved away from the side of the opening so that she could be seen,
then said, "It's alright.  We won't hurt you.  What is
your name?"</p>

<p>The girl, looked up and focused all of her attention on Sonya.
Her face was streaked with dirt and her clothing totally
inadequate for the winter, and then whispered, "Sam."</p>

<p>"That's a nice name, Sam," said Sonya as she carefully exited the building,
all the while keeping eye contact with the little girl.  She moved closer
to the waif and then said, "would you like to
come inside and get warm?  We have some food also.  Then we can
tell you our story, so you can tell the others."</p>

<p>That had been all that was required.  The girl was intelligent;
she had to be to have survived that long, and she knew that she
had been sent because the others in the destroyed town thought
that she was expendable.  She thought the offer over, and decided that
the chance to get warm, and for hot food was worth the risk.  She followed
Sonya back into the building, and became the liaison between the slayers
and the town's survivors.</p>

<p>Over the next week, Sonya, by using the extra clothing and food
that they had brought as currency, was able to get the other
survivors to scout the other towns surrounding the besieged
capital and find the mages she needed.  By the end of the week
twenty-two mages, of various ranks, had made their way to Sonya's camp.
Sonya knew then that it was time to go.  They were now a
significant presence in the area, and that would be sure to draw demon
attention before long.</p>

<p>They had left the following day, the thirteen slayers escorting
the mages, and Sam.  Sonya had decided to bring the little girl
back with her since both of her parents were dead.  Since she had no
living relatives, she would have continued to be at the mercy of the
other survivors in the town.</p>

<p>They had made good time back to the village, given that, for once the
weather appeared to be cooperating with them.  This had
resulted in their making excellent progress each day, even given the
reality that several of the mages had to move slowly due to
lack of nutrition and injuries.  Sonya had not seen any signs of demon
presence and hoped that their luck would hold just a little longer, since
she figured that they were only about a day or two from the village.
However, as they entered a small valley one
morning, shortly before noon, disaster struck.  Sonya could see
that a force of demons already occupied it, a force over fifty
strong.</p>

<p>"Goddess help us now," she said, "we were so close."</p>

<p>Sonya immediately arranged her slayers so that they formed a
protective half circle around the mages, who, given their
relative lack of experience, and condition, would not be in a
position to offer any assistance.  She then calmly waited for the demons,
who had already spotted her and were charging down the
valley, to get close enough before she had her forces attack with their
bows.</p>

<p>"It's in the hands of the Goddess now," she said to herself
before she focused herself for the upcoming battle and called out to
the others, "Fire!"</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>Buffy and Daithi had pushed themselves as hard as they could.
However, the storm that had passed just before they had departed the
inn had deposited several feet of snow in the passes.  This
had caused a significant delay in their progress towards the
valley that Buffy had seen in the vision, and Daithi had
recognized from Willow's description.</p>

<p>They had spent the previous night in an abandoned cottage, about a half-days
travel from the valley that Buffy had seen.  As soon as they had awoke,
the two of them had immediately gathered their packs and headed out,
Buffy fearing that they would be too late.</p>

<p>As they entered the head of the valley, it looked like Buffy's
fears were proving correct.  For ahead of them was a massive
force of demons charging towards a small group of humans.</p>

<p>"You were right," said Daithi, "we're too late."</p>

<p>"Maybe not.  If Sonya and the others can hold them off for a
couple of minutes, we should be able to hit them from behind."</p>

<p>Daithi looked over at the slayer, as if she was possessed, with a
disbelieving
look on his face.  Buffy glanced over at him and
said, reassuringly, "it's ok.  I'm not that crazy.  Besides, it's what
I do."</p>

<p>Just after Buffy finished saying a prayer to the Goddess, and as she
reached down to her chest to grasp her sword, which had
migrated through the layers of clothing without burning them,
they saw the front ranks of the demons fall to the onslaught of
the slayers arrows.</p>

<p>"That's it," said Buffy, "now's our chance while they are
distracted by Sonya and their wounded."</p>

<p>The two warriors made their way swiftly, but quietly, along the
trail made by the demons in their rushing attack on Sonya and the others.
Within ten minutes, they were within striking distance
of the demon rearguard.  Buffy motioned for Daithi to head to the right,
while she would move to her left.  This, would she hoped
create additional confusion within the demon ranks once they
began their attack.</p>

<p>Buffy quickly found a position from which to launch her attack.  Thinking
over her plan of attack, she mentally cursed herself for not having arranged
for a signal to Daithi when she was ready.
Thinking, "oh well, I'll just leap in and start slashing.
Hopefully Daithi will see the effect I have and launch his own
attack."</p>

<p>Buffy gave one more quick prayer to the Goddess then raised her
sword overhead, causing it to burst into flame.  Moving quickly
to strike before any of the demons thought to look behind, she
crossed the short distance between herself and three mottled,
troll like demons, who were armed with heavy wooden clubs.  She
raised her sword and then swiftly struck a downward slashing
blow, which sliced deep into the shoulder and chest of the first of her
opponents.</p>

<p>Screaming, "time to die, scum bags," Buffy immediately pulled
back her sword and then thrust it deep into her victim's back,
killing it instantly by piercing his heart.</p>

<p>Pulling out her sword from the falling body, Buffy then leaped to the
right, to the side of her second target, avoiding the
crushing blow from his club, which went whistling through the
space that she had just vacated.  Buffy pirouetted, ducked under the
return swing from the demon, and simultaneously slashed at
his legs, slicing through one leg, and deeply into the other.
The demon roared in pain, alerting several of his companions who turned
to see what had caused the trouble, and immediately
dropped to the ground, to bleed out and die without causing any
further trouble to Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy paused for a second, to catch her breath, and saw that
Daithi had indeed used her attack as the signal for him to spring into
action.  She then noticed that her attack had drawn the
attention of several other, at least ten, demons.  Thinking,
"time to be defensive for a minute or so," she moved back from
her second victim and assumed a defensive pose, her sword moving back
and forth in front of her.</p>

<p>The demons facing her decided that their best option would be to rush
this foolish human.  Moving slightly apart, to try and flank Buffy, they
then rushed at her with a roar.  Buffy didn't wait.  Seeing the start
of their rush, she jumped to the left, to the
extreme edge of the group of demons, and thrust into the belly of her
closest opponent.  Using his scream of pain as a distraction Buffy then
leaped forward and rolled over her sword in midair; as she exited her
manoeuvre she slashed out, hitting the second
demon in the skirmish line, who had just begun to turn to follow her,
in the side cutting into his lungs, and putting him out of
action for the rest of the battle.</p>

<p>Knowing that she was finished if she remained in a stand up fight Buffy
continued to move quickly, slashing at various opponents,
then using her superior strength and speed to move on.  She
worked her way across the rear of the demon force until she met
up with Daithi.  He had followed a similar strategy, moving
gradually toward Buffy.  Once they had met, Buffy took another
quick breather, to allow Daithi and herself to regain some
energy.  They then resumed their attack, moving back and forth
across the demons who were now confronted with attacks on both
sides.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sonya attacked in strength.  She had immediately
noticed when the demons eased off their attack on her group.
Surmising that she had somehow received assistance, from where
she wasn't too concerned about, she paused for a few moments,
allowing her group of slayers to regain their breath.  Once they were
ready she led a charge into the now very demoralized demons.  That was
enough to turn the tide; the demons were routed, and
began to flee the valley leaving their wounded, and most of their weapons
behind.</p>

<p>Buffy and Daithi then busied themselves, dispatching the demon
wounded, while Sonya and the other slayers patched up their
wounded.  Once the grisly job of finishing off the demons was
completed, Buffy came over to where Sonya had set up her
impromptu first-aid station.</p>

<p>"Hi Buffy," said Sonya, looking up as she approached, "excellent timing."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Buffy, sitting down on a dead log, "need any
help?"</p>

<p>"Your healing skills would be appreciated," said Sonya, "for a
couple of the more critically wounded, that I could do nothing
for."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do."</p>

<p>Buffy and Sonya went to the area, which had been set aside for
the more seriously wounded.  Buffy saw that she was too late for three
of the group.  Two of the mages, and one on Sonya's
companions had been killed; they were now in the hands of the
Goddess.  However, Sonya did indicate that there were a number of serious
injuries amongst the slayers, serious enough that if
Buffy did not act quickly the number of the dead would grow.</p>

<p>Buffy approached the young woman who Sonya indicated was the most seriously
injured.  She looked down at the girl, and recognized
her as Alya.  She was one of the youngest of the new slayers, no more
than fifteen.  She was crying softly, in obvious agony from the five
parallel gashes that had cut deep into her side and
across her belly.</p>

<p>Buffy bent down and picked up one of the woman's hands, and said softly,
"Alya.  I'm going to do my best, but you know that I've
not got much experience at this?"</p>

<p>"I know," choked out Alya, "but you are the only hope I have."</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to use my gift to heal you," asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"I will," replied Alya, completing the ritual that would allow
Buffy to use her magic on a human.</p>

<p>Buffy took a closer look at the wound, as she carefully unwrapped the
blood-soaked cloth that had been pressed against it, in a
futile attempt to staunch the bleeding.  She saw that the flesh
had been mangled, as if by a series of serrated knives, and a
yellow-green pus was oozing from the slashes.</p>

<p>"I hope you got the slime that did this," said Buffy, as she
gently began to wash away the worst of the pus with a warm cloth.</p>

<p>"He died just as he was hitting me," said Alya, wincing as Buffy cleaned
the wounds, "I just didn't leap back fast enough."</p>

<p>"You will next time," reassured Buffy, as she tossed aside the
cloth she had been using to clean the wound.  Buffy then paused, focused
her attention entirely on the young woman on the ground
in front of her.  She translated her sight into the magical
realm, and looked for the energy ties that bound Alya to the
material world.  As expected, Buffy saw that the ties were
dimming, as the life force drained away from the wounded woman.</p>

<p>Buffy thought to herself, "got to give her the energy to stand up to
the healing," and began to use her feedback tools to pump
energy back into Alya.  She then called up the new skills that
she had been training with, and laid her hands directly on the
young woman's wounds.  She concentrated, and focused her
attention on the damaged tissue, convincing it to accelerate the bodies
natural repair process.  She maintained her focus on her
task, her knees rapidly stiffening beneath her until she could
see the wounds close under her hands.  As Buffy finished her
healing accomplishment, Alya collapsed in exhaustion, and due to her
relief from the pain.</p>

<p>Letting out her breath in a soft wheeze Buffy stood up, stretched out
her legs, turned to Sonya, and said, "she'll be ok now.  She will sleep
for the next few hours and wake up hungry as a bear.  Now who's next?"</p>

<p>Buffy spent the remainder of the afternoon going from patient to patient,
healing each as best she could.  Meanwhile, Daithi and
Sonya got busy preparing and fortifying a campsite, since it was obvious
that they would not be able to proceed any further that
day.</p>

<p>As dusk fell, Buffy sat on a log before the campfire, exhausted
beyond belief from her healing efforts.  Barely recognizing the
dish that was put into her hands as food, she began to
mechanically eat the meal that had been prepared.  Before she was finished
her plate, she collapsed in exhaustion and had to be
carried to her tent by Daithi.</p>

<p>Buffy awoke, just as the blankets were being tucked around her to whisper,
"Thanks."</p>

<p>"Sleep well.  You deserve it."</p>

<p>Buffy had one more thought just before dropping into the arms of Morpheus
for the night and sent out a, -found them love.  We'll
be back in two days.-</p>

<p>She was reassured to hear Willow's, -love you, miss you, will see you
soon,- in reply.</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>The demon master was pacing in his command centre, impatiently
waiting for news about the attack on the group of humans heading into
the mountains.  Suddenly, as his back was to the door, he
stiffened then tuned and made obeisance.</p>

<p>"Lord," he said to the demon who was his commander and his master, "how
may I serve?"</p>

<p>"Talaker," said the huge, over three meters, demon.  "You've been keeping
secrets again."</p>

<p>"Yes, master," said the demon Talaker, knowing it was pointless to try
to lie to his master.</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"We don't know, yet, my lord," replied Talaker, beginning to
wonder if these were his last moments alive.</p>

<p>Just then, a demon lieutenant approached the two demon lords. He bowed
and waited for permission to speak.  Finally, the demon
overlord gave him leave to speak.</p>

<p>"Masters," he began, "we've received word."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the overlord, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Good news, my lord, the force that was tracking a group of humans into
the mountains, who we thought would have knowledge of the
slayer," he added in clarification, "has been nearly destroyed."</p>

<p>"And why exactly is this good news," asked the overlord, wondering if
everyone on Talaker's staff was brain damaged.</p>

<p>"They were destroyed by the slayer," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"That is good news, and it would be even better, if they found out where
she went."</p>

<p>"They did, lord," replied the lieutenant moving towards the main battle
map.  "They are here," he said, pointing to the town of
Morning Breeze.</p>

<p>"I trust, Talaker, that you have a plan?"</p>

<p>"I do lord."</p>

<p>"Please explain."</p>

<p>"In anticipation of news about the slayer from this group of
humans I had already moved an army north, towards that very town."</p>

<p>"That is good news, how large?"</p>

<p>"Nearly seven hundred, lord."</p>

<p>"Excellent.  Now, I think that you had better get to them, and
lead by example.  I needn't tell you that failure is not an
option, now do I?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord.  I'll leave immediately."</p>

<hr size=1 width=50%>

<p>Two days after Buffy and Daithi had linked up with Sonya, they
made it back to the village, and immediately plunged into a
frantic series of preparations for Willow's attack on the hell-
mouths.  Willow concluded that the demons who had survived
Buffy's rescue mission would immediately alert their lord as to
the location of the humans, and that the demon leadership would
then be in a position to rapidly deduce Willow's location and
launch an attack.</p>

<p>Willow knew, however, that she could not rush things.  She
therefore spent a precious week with the new mages, and the
townspeople who would round out the circles, practicing the
rituals that she would use to attack the demon's energy
transportation network.  Grael, Frankel and Amana spent the time preparing
an area in one of the barns, which would be big enough for Willow's
purposes,
by cleaning and arranging for a suitable
source of heat.  Buffy and Daithi worked on the defences of the
town, and prepared for an attack all hoped wouldn't come, but
knew that would arrive all the same.</p>

<p>Finally, just as the month was ending, Willow announced at
breakfast that everything and everyone was ready, and that she
would perform the ritual that night, after everyone who was
involved had had a chance to prepare.</p>

<p>Turning to Buffy at the breakfast table Willow then said, "that's it
then, we're committed to this course of action."</p>

<p>Just as Buffy was about to reply the door to the inn burst in,
followed by an exhausted Padrick, gasping for breath, who called out,
"My Lady, demons!  Demons are about to attack the village in strength!"</p>
