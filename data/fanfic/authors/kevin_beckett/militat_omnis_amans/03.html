<p>So far, the day was going into the crapper, thought the one-meter
high
green-scaled demon that had the rather un-descriptive name of Kratel.
First, there was the rushed forced march by the six of them through
the
night to get to the city.  Then trying to figure out how to get into
the
damned castle without anyone noticing.  They had then stumbled
around
through the various buildings and rooms of the castle complex trying to
find
a group of people that they could one, overpower and two, kidnap without
too
much trouble. Finally stopping at one of an endless number of doors on
what
he figured was the second or third floor of the complex, he had heard
a
number of voices and thought, "this is it, it only sounds like three or
four
people are in this room."  Gesturing to his companions to take up
positions
on either side of the door, Kratel kicked the door open and leapt into
the
room screaming, "Ok - scum, now we are going to get some answers!"</p>

<p>However, instead of the three or four people he was expecting to see in
the
room there was at least twenty, and they were in no way intimidated by
his
entrance.</p>

<p>"Oh-Oh," he thought as battle was joined, "this might have been a
mistake."</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow had been forewarned by Buffy's slayer senses that
someone
or something bad was about to happen so when the six demons burst
through
the door they were already moving into defensive postures.  Buffy,
being
without a weapon, had turned to the table and had grabbed a candlestick
to
use in her defence while Willow had begun to think about any spells
she
could use.</p>

<p>"Willow, get behind the table!" Buffy yelled as she turned towards
the
leader of the demons that had burst into the meeting room.</p>

<p>"No problem," replied the redhead as she leaped onto the table and
then
jumped on the other side.  "Hey, Amana, Grael and the rest of you, get
back
here.  We have to give Buffy room to work," she continued gesturing to
the
other mages to join her on the far side of the table, away from the
direct
action.</p>

<p>Buffy rapidly thought to herself, "six on one, with some magic help
from
Will and the others - if they get their act together, not bad odds."
She
launched into a flying leap, which resulted in shortening the
distance
between her and the green demon that was in the lead.</p>

<p>"Prepare for pain, greeny," she yelled as she did a sweep kick on the
demon
and sent him flying backwards into one of his mates who was dyed a
nauseating shade of purple.</p>

<p>"Oooof" went Kratel as he thought, "gods, this one is fast."</p>

<p>"Two out temporarily," thought the slayer as she twirled towards a
third
demon, this a blue-green humanoid roughly two meters in height, and
proceeded to give him a quick series of left-handed punches to his
chest
which left him gasping for air, she then knocked the demon tumbling to
the
floor with a swift bash over his head, using the candlestick that she
was
still holding in her right hand.</p>

<p>"Three down, three to go," Buffy thought to herself, time to get some
help.
"Will, I need a distraction or two!"  Buffy yelled out as she
roundhouse
kicked a fourth, red skinned, demon back through the door, in the
process
knocking down a charging Daithi, who had been coming to investigate
the
cause of the turmoil.</p>

<p>"What the heck?" Thought Daithi as he was knocked to the ground with a
big,
red, unconscious, demon on top of him.</p>

<p>"Distraction coming up," thought Willow as she proceeded to levitate a
chair
and send it towards a blue skinned demon that had until that point
been
sneaking up behind Buffy.</p>

<p>"Buffy behind you," Willow yelled, as the chair broke apart over the
demons
back.</p>

<p>Buffy turned around saying, "thanks love," and proceeded to grab one of
the
distracted demon's arms and swung him around to pile into the
remaining
yellow skinned demon, who was in the process of trying to get out of
the
door, having quickly decided that things were not going their way.</p>

<p>"Driaghtit chent!" Exclaimed Amana as a bolt of light left her hands
and
impacted on the green demon that had been the first target of Buffy's
attack.  Kratel, who had been just getting up from the floor, was hit
with
enough force from the spell to knock him clear across the room to
impact
heavily against the wall.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" He yelled, thinking, "this is crazy, I'm in over my head, we have
go
get out of here."  He looked around the room and saw that there was a
window
on the same wall as he had been thrown into.  "That's it," he thought,
"out
the window we go."</p>

<p>"Men - to me," Kratel yelled out, "we are over matched with magic, we
have
to get out and back to our master." He continued as he made his way over
to
the window.</p>

<p>"Not so fast blue boy," called out Buffy as she the grabbed a blue
skinned
demon, which she had previous used as a battering toy, who was getting
up
and trying to reach his leader and hurled him to the floor again.</p>

<p>"I think that we are going to want to ask you guys a few questions,"
she
continued, as she sat on the demon's back and carefully bashed the
demon's
head into the stone floor a few times just to make sure that this time
it
stayed down.</p>

<p>At this point the dyed purple demon, who had just gotten up from the
floor,
kicked Buffy in the side, which had the two fold effect of one, knocking
her
off the demon she was in the process of pummelling and two, making her
very
annoyed.</p>

<p>"That's it, you revolting excuse of a fashion statement," Buffy
yelled
rolling on the floor and springing up onto her feet.  "Now I'm really
mad,
and you are going to pay."</p>

<p>She proceeded to attack the purple demon with a combination of kicks
and
punches, and was quickly able to grab one of his arms and twist it
behind
him.</p>

<p>"You going to act nicely now, scum-bag?" She asked with mock
sweetness,
applying just enough force to make the demon feel genuine pain.</p>

<p>"Not on your life little girl," the demon replied grimacing in pain, "when
I
get free, I'm going to tear your arms off and eat them," he added.</p>

<p>"Now that's not very nice," Buffy replied, "since I have you like this,
but
just to make sure, if you get free that is, I'll take care of any
impending
problems now."  With that, Buffy proceeded to coolly fracture both of
the
demon's arms before hurling him with enough force into the yellow demon
to
propel both of them into the wall.</p>

<p>Kratel seeing that he was the only one of his group still standing
thought,
"screw this, I'm for the window," and proceeded to make a break for
the
window.</p>

<p>"Gleiy teaddey!" Yelled Grael, having seen the demon breaking for the
window, and from his hands sprung a long rope like object.
Unfortunately,
the demon had also seen the spell and was able to duck the rope
heading
towards him.  Before anyone else was able to act, he leaped through
the
window, breaking it in the process, and escaped to freedom.</p>

<p>"Damn," he thought, "the boss is going to be really pissed about
this."  He
then proceeded to leave the castle neighbourhood and make his way out of
the
city.</p>

<p>"Well," deadpanned an irritated slayer, "that was certainly a good way
to
work off breakfast."</p>

<p>The entire encounter had taken less than five minutes from the time the
door
had been burst open to the time the green demon leapt out of the window.
The
remaining demons in the study were quickly pined down and tied up.
They
were to be held for questioning by Daithi and his guardsmen later in
the
day.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>About an hour later Buffy, Willow, Daithi and some of the mages
re-convened
in the study.  It had been tidied in the interim and the window had
been
replaced.</p>

<p>Willow turned to the others and said; "I guess we should finish off
the
schedules for Buffy and me now."</p>

<p>"I agree," replied Amana, "however, in setting those schedules we must
take
into consideration this mornings activities.  The attack on the castle
today
can only mean the opposition is stepping up their efforts, just as
Daithi
indicated last night."</p>

<p>"I only think that this was a feint," replied Daithi, "they were too few
in
number to be a real attack. I'll know for certain once we finish
questioning
them, but my gut feeling is that they were only looking for information,
and
just happened to stumble into the wrong room. I'll continue to
investigate,
but I believe that we still have some time before the demons gather for
a
major strike at us."</p>

<p>"I'm much more confident about our chances, however," replied
Frankel.  "I'm
still stunned by the speed and strength of Buffy."</p>

<p>"I'm the slayer," Buffy replied, "It's what I've been born to do."</p>

<p>"I know," replied the sage, "you told us, but seeing you in action put
it
into a whole different framework."</p>

<p>"I just wish that I had been able to see more," said Daithi, "however,
it
was kind of hard, what with an unconscious demon on top of me."</p>

<p>"Sorry about that," replied Buffy, "but I didn't really have time to
place
where I was throwing them."</p>

<p>"It's ok," the commander answered, "however, I think that I'll be
seeing
lots of you in action before this is all finished."</p>

<p>"All right then," Grael said taking up the conversation.  "Before we
were so
rudely interrupted, we were just setting down the schedule for the next
few
days.  I think that we should continue those discussions."</p>

<p>"The morning is mostly gone," Amana, continued, "however, I think that
we
have time left to assess both of your magical potentials before
lunch."</p>

<p>"Then after lunch, we will have the two of you down in the training
halls
for some physical assessments," said Daithi finishing the opening remarks
of
the group.</p>

<p>"Sounds peachy to me," Willow replied, "what's involved in assessing
our
magic potential?"
"What potential?" Asked Buffy semi-seriously, "I probably have the
magic
power of a gnat."
"Don't sell yourself short," replied Amana, "we believe that you have
some
significant talent, and when it will be combined with Willow's it will
be
awesome," she continued.</p>

<p>Buffy looked slightly sceptical, but was willing to be convinced
otherwise.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Grael, "we will adjourn to one of our work areas, and
begin
the testing."</p>

<p>With that Buffy, Willow, Grael and Amana left the study and headed to
Amana's workroom, which was located two floors above.</p>

<p>The room was about twice the size of the study below.  It had several
large
worktables in the middle of the room, floor to ceiling bookshelves were
on
three walls and large windows were on the fourth.  Two large desks
were
located under the windows.  The tables were covered in flasks, beakers
and
other paraphernalia.  In addition to countless books, the bookshelves
also
held numerous objects such as skulls, candles, stuffed animals and
other
curiosities.  The desks were covered in parchments, note-pads and
other
items.  Two fireplaces and several large lanterns provided
illumination for
the room.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are," said Amana, "this is my workroom, and we will begin
the
process of accessing both your potential, and your existing level of
training here."</p>

<p>"Take a seat," she continued, pointing to several chairs that had
been
pulled up in front of one of the fireplaces.</p>

<p>"We will begin with an overview of magic and how people who are
properly
trained are able to use it," continued Grael as he handed the two
women
glasses filled with a red drink.</p>

<p>Both Willow and Buffy looked at the drinks suspiciously, "what in
this?"
Asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Just something to help you relax and allow us to begin the process
of
assessing your magical abilities," replied Grael.</p>

<p>With that reassurance, both women drank the cool, sweet and slightly
alcoholic beverage.  Almost immediately, they both began to feel
their
muscles relax.</p>

<p>"Great stuff," Willow said, "we should bottle this and take it back -
it
would be a great hit in the dorms."</p>

<p>"Willow," Grael said after a few minutes, "we know that you have been
somewhat successful in using magic, both in your own reality and, as
you
demonstrated this morning, here.  However, how much do you know about
what
you do? How you do it? And why things you try sometimes both work and
don't
work?"
"Well, I've been using a combination of books that I've been able to
find,
and I've also been able to receive assistance from other witches that
I've
run into."  Willow said, beginning to wonder where the conversation
was
going.  "Go on," prompted Amana.</p>

<p>"And, I don't really know much else," continued Willow.  "I mean
sometimes I
need circles and rituals and other items to do some of the simplest
things,
and other times major things happen just because I want them to," she
added
shaking her head.  "It just confuses me, most of the time," she
concluded
looking hopefully at the two mages.</p>

<p>"About what we thought Amana," said Grael who then turned towards the
slayer.  "Buffy, why do you think that you have the abilities and
powers
that you do?"</p>

<p>"Never really thought about it," answered the slayer, "I've just always
been
told that I was born to it, and somehow it was in me."</p>

<p>"Do either of your parents show any sign of the abilities that you
do?"
asked Amana.</p>

<p>"No, not really," answered Buffy, "I mean, my dad is a klutz, and my mom
is
not much better."</p>

<p>"Then why do you think that your powers come from genetics?"  Asked
Amana.
When both Buffy and Willow looked confused at this questioning of one of
the
basic doctrines of slaying, she continued, "trick question, it is
genetic,
but not in the manner you are thinking of."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, my parents are not my parents?  That I was adopted
or
something?"</p>

<p>"No, they are your parents, however, it would appear that 'help' was
provided in the construction your genetic makeup.  Most likely while
you
were still in your mother's womb."  Grael said.</p>

<p>"How?" Asked a stunned Buffy and Willow simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Glad you asked that question," replied Grael with a twinkle in his
eye,
"for it goes to the core of what magic is, and how it can be manipulated
and
or controlled."</p>

<p>"Okay, I'll bite," answered Willow, "what is magic?"</p>

<p>"Magic, to put it simply is everything," answered Amana.  "It is the
energy
that joins all of life together, it is the building block of our
existence."</p>

<p>"Luke, use the force," Buffy whispered to Willow."</p>

<p>"What's the force?" Asked Amana.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied a smiling Willow, "just a line from a movie."</p>

<p>"So at its essence, magic is the energy that joins molecules together
then?"
Willow continued.</p>

<p>"And it explains, in part the slayer question," continued Amana.</p>

<p>"What slayer question?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Simply how you are able to do what you do," answered Grael.  "Tell
me, does
this 'watcher' you told us about use magic?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Willow.</p>

<p>"Well then," continued Grael, "I think that he, or someone working with
him,
manipulated Buffy's genetic make-up while she was in the womb."</p>

<p>"I'm a lab experiment?" Shrieked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Well, not an experiment, since they appear to have been doing this
for
centuries," answered an equally outraged Willow.</p>

<p>"Definitely unethical," said Amana.</p>

<p>"How's that?" Willow asked, still stunned by the idea that watchers, and
the
watcher council, could be so manipulative.</p>

<p>"Using your powers and abilities on another human," said Grael,
"without
their permission, is evil and may never be forgiven."</p>

<p>"We have a word for this type of person," continued Amana.</p>

<p>"Yes," asked the slayer.</p>

<p>"Warlock," answered Amana.</p>

<p>"But we will have time later to fully discus magic and the ethics
surrounding its use," Amana said as she stood up and added more wood to
the
fire.  " Willow you had asked if magical energy was akin to the energy
which
holds molecules together."</p>

<p>"And yes, to a certain extent it is," continued Grael, "however, what
turns
a normal into a mage is the ability to shape and use this energy."</p>

<p>"Normal?" Asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"The vast majority of the population who do not have the innate talent
to
perform magic," answered Grael.</p>

<p>"Only one in a ten million people has more than rudimentary talent to
use
magic," Amana continued, "fewer than one in fifty million have the
talent
that Grael and I have, you appear to be at this level Buffy."</p>

<p>"And fewer than one in a billion have your apparent talent Willow,"
concluded Grael.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied a suddenly very quiet Willow, "how can you tell?"</p>

<p>"First of all, both Grael and I have taught for more than twenty
years,"
Amana answered, "and second, since we sat down to talk we have been
measuring the two of you."</p>

<p>"The drink I gave you has the relaxation properties that I
mentioned,"
continued Grael, "it also has one other property."</p>

<p>"What's that?  Asked the slayer.</p>

<p>"It allows someone, who has been trained, to measure the amount of
energy
that is attracted to person who drank the mixture," Amana concluded.</p>

<p>"Great," said Willow, "I'm a big magnet."</p>

<p>"Willow," asked Grael, "when you performed your spells, and rituals,
didn't
you feel energy being attracted to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I thought..." said Willow quietly, "well, I didn't really
know
what to think," concluded Willow.</p>

<p>"Well I do," Amana replied, "and it was your ability to use magics that
was
attracting the energy although you didn't know that at the time.</p>

<p>"What gives then with spells, and tools?" Asked Willow.</p>

<p>"They are used as focuses," replied Amana. "In the working of some magic
it
is useful to use a device or object or 'spell' to help you focus the
magical
energy and then to release it as you wished it to be used."</p>

<p>"Some specific items," she continued, "such as those based on iron, can
be
either useful or disruptive."</p>

<p>"Iron, in particular works in this way," continued the older woman.</p>

<p>"When
it is used in a sword a mage can focus the energy raised into it and
then
use very effectively.  However, it is also a magic attractor, so it
may also
disrupt the mage when they are trying to use magic."</p>

<p>"There is a price for each benefit," added Grael.</p>

<p>"Okay," replied Willow, "what about rituals and circles then."</p>

<p>"They are used for a slightly different purpose," replied Grael.  "We
use
them to focus, and transfer the energy from a number of people, not all
have
to be mages, and send it to a mage for use in great magics."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," Willow said, "however, it's never been
clearly
explained to me before."</p>

<p>"Now, we will spend some time working with the two of you to measure
more
accurately your abilities, and to judge the level of your training,"
injected Amana.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm easy," said Buffy, "I've got no training."</p>

<p>"That's true," replied Grael, "however, we will have to determine which
area
or areas your abilities are focused in."</p>

<p>"What do you mean areas?"  Asked Willow.</p>

<p>"You are aware that we divide the essence into five areas?"  Replied
Amana.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the redhead, "Earth, Fire, Water, Air and Self."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Grael, "and it turns out that each mage is best suited
to
one, sometimes two of these areas."</p>

<p>"They then concentrate on the manipulation of that type of essence,
and
develop their capabilities there," continued Amana.</p>

<p>"So what she and I are going to do is test you in these areas and figure
out
where your 'inclinations' lay so that we will then be able to
concentrate
your training there," concluded Grael.</p>

<p>For the next two hours the women were tested using a variety of
techniques.
Some like levitation were familiar to them; others such as matter
manipulation were not.  Finally, Grael brought the testing to a
conclusion
and had everyone sit down once again by the fire.</p>

<p>"That was certainly interesting," said a very excited Willow.  For in
the
last two hours she had been exposed to more magic than she had in her
life
to that point.</p>

<p>"Different," was the only response from the exhausted slayer.  She was
as
tired as if she had battled dozens of vampires and demons.</p>

<p>"Well, ladies," said Amana, "this has been one of the most exciting days
in
my life."</p>

<p>"I have to agree," said Grael, "the two of you have certainly met,
and
exceeded our hopes."</p>

<p>"Why am I exhausted and witch girl here is bouncing off the ceiling?"
Asked
Buffy.</p>

<p>"Mainly because she has so much more ability," answered Grael, "and
because
we put the two of you through an exhausting mental workout which you are
not
used to.  This type of activity is very strenuous and
exhausting."</p>

<p>"The two of you are probably very hungry," continued Amana.</p>

<p>"Details, need to know details, food can wait, what can I, no we,
do?"
Bubbled Willow.</p>

<p>"Let's start with Buffy first," replied Amana, "As expected she has
significant potential, but is totally un-trained."</p>

<p>"No surprises there," replied the slayer.</p>

<p>"None at all," said Grael, "however, we were able to determine that
your
particular areas of strength lie in the manipulation of self and
air."</p>

<p>"Which means?" Continued Buffy.
"Principally that you will be able to control your body and the essences
of
air," answered Amana, "In fact, we now believe that your 'superior'
healing
and some of your reflexes and speed are merely an offshoot of your
magic.
In other words, you heal faster and react faster, because you are able
to
magically repair and boost the energy output of your muscles and
tendons."</p>

<p>"Say what?" Asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"It's just that you have been doing this unconsciously until now,"
replied
Grael.  "We will endeavour to train you so that you can do it
consciously,
which should significantly improve your abilities and extend the range
of
what you will be able to do."</p>

<p>"Such as?" Asked Buffy's lover and friend.</p>

<p>"Such as repairing bone, replacing blood loss, curing viral and other
illnesses and the ability to regenerate lost organs and limbs," he
replied
to a stunned Willow.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Buffy in the sudden silence.  "What does the manipulation
of air
allow me to do, fly?"</p>

<p>"In the short term we will be able to train you to build shield and
other
things like vacuums where you wish, in addition to skills such as
levitation," answered Amana, secretly pleased that the two young women
were
still able to keep their sense of humour though all that had
happened.</p>

<p>"And in the long term?" Asked an excited Willow; she was beginning to
see
incredible potential options in fighting what until then had seemed
an
endless, and ultimately hopeless, fight against the forces of evil, not
only
on this world but also back home.
"Massive wind movements - tornadoes, hurricanes and other wind
storms,"
replied Amana.</p>

<p>"But it will take time to train you to use your abilities at this
level,"
continued Grael, "and I don't know how much time we will have to do
this
training."</p>

<p>"Okay, you have gutted and filleted me," said the slayer, "now what about
my
lover?"</p>

<p>"Willow," answered Grael, "Willow is a once in several lifetimes
find."</p>

<p>"Eh?" Replied the redhead.</p>

<p>"Your abilities are overwhelming," he continued, "and with training you
will
most likely be the most powerful person on either world."</p>

<p>"Not only that," said Amana, "but with this training you will be able
to
control the essence in all five areas."</p>

<p>"Right now, your have self trained yourself in the disciplines of Earth,
Air
and Self magic, however, neither Grael or myself were able to detect
any
weak points in your ability to manipulate either Water or Fire
magic."</p>

<p>"You are," said Grael, "what has been until now a legend."</p>

<p>"Say what?" Asked the confused witch.</p>

<p>"An arch-mage," replied Grael, "someone who is able to manipulate any
form
of energy and essence."</p>

<p>"That's enough for now," said Amana, "why don't the two of you go down
to
lunch, after all you are expected in the training halls as soon as
you
finish eating.  We will continue our talk tonight after dinner in
our
study," she concluded as she led the two contemplative women out to the
hall
where they were met by Aiofe, Bridie and a cat.</p>

<p>"Meeow," said Shadow-Cat who continued plaintively, "Meeoooow!"</p>

<p>"She's been in such a state madam," said Aiofe, "trying to get in to
see
you, and I think looking for lunch."</p>

<p>"Okay, then" said the arch-mage smiling even with the importance of
the
morning's revelations still fresh in her mind, "food it is."  The
four
humans and one feline then headed down to the dining hall for lunch.
Amana
turned back into her workroom and retuned to sit by the fire with
Grael
after stopping by a bookshelf to collect a bottle and two glasses.</p>

<p>"Will you tell them?" Asked Grael as his long time friend and lover sat
down
and poured each of them large glasses of mead.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she replied thoughtfully as she watched the mead in her
glass
reflect the firelight, "I think that we can wait a few days for the two
of
them to get comfortable with their abilities and the new
surroundings."</p>

<p>"We have been very daring in setting out on this course of action,"
she
continued, "and it's going to take time for the two of them to get up
to
speed and to trust us fully."</p>

<p>"True enough," he said sipping his drink and stretching out his long
tired
legs before the fire, "for all of their casualness, I think that they
are
still in a bit of shock."</p>

<p>"I agree, and if we let them know what the potential of the two of
them
working together is, we might lose them altogether," she said as she
too
stretched out before the fire.  "Besides, knowing those two, even as
little
as we do, they just might figure it out for themselves."</p>

<p>"That would make everything much easier," Grael replied as the two of
them
fell silent in companionship and contemplation.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Later in the day, two sweaty women, one in much worse shape than the
other,
were heading back to their chambers after participating in an
extremely
intense three-hour workout.  They were trailed by a cat and preceded
by
their two servants.</p>

<p>"Not much further love," the blond said as she partially held up the
other
woman, "we'll get you into the bath soon."  Buffy was both amused
and
pleased. She had just finished a great workout where she had sparred
with
Daithi and several of his guardsmen, often two or three at a time.
After
some initial doubts by the guardsmen about her talents, Daithi had
decided
not to reveal to them any details about Buffy or about the morning's
activities, they quickly realised that she was more than capable of
holding
her own against fully trained troops.  She was amused by her
lover's
experience; Willow had not fared as well as Buffy since she was unused
to
the strenuous exercises she had been put through.  Buffy was convinced
that
every muscle in Willow's body was screaming.</p>

<p>"It'll be ok," she said to her friend, "Daithi has given me some
ointment,
and after your bath I'll massage your sore muscles," she continued
smiling
at her.</p>

<p>"You laugh at me," Willow said grimacing in pain, "and as soon as I can
lift
my arms I'll turn you into a frog."</p>

<p>"No laughing, promise" said Buffy, "besides, if you turn me into a frog,
who
will you have to massage sore body parts?"
When they entered the room Buffy turned to Aiofe and Bridie and said,
"that's enough for know, come back just before dinner."</p>

<p>As soon as the two other women had left Buffy turned towards Willow
and
said, "okay now, lets see about getting you into the bath."</p>

<p>"Hurt, pain, much soreness," complained a tired Willow as Buffy went
over
and directed her towards the bathroom.</p>

<p>"I hurt in places I never even new existed," she continued as her
lover
slowly began to peel the stiff armour that they both had been issued off
of
her.</p>

<p>"Shush, now, love, let me get these clothes off of you."  Buffy said
as she
continued to slowly undress Willow, noticing that she was swollen in
several
places and that bruises were beginning to develop all over her body.
Willow
was a mess, and Buffy quickly figured out that she was going to need
her
help to even get into the bath.</p>

<p>"Will, love, sit down on the edge of the bath for a second while I get
out
of these clothes," Buffy said as she rapidly stripped off her own
clothing.
Willow was too tired to move, and instead of sitting on the edge of
the
bath, had simply collapsed onto the floor.  Buffy went over to Willow,
and
picking her up in her arms, carried her into the bathtub.</p>

<p>"Now love," she said softly, "lets let the hot water sooth those
aching
muscles of yours."  Buffy carefully placed Willow on one of the
benches
inside of the bathtub, and picking up soap and a washcloth, began to
softly
wash the other woman.</p>

<p>"Nice, very nice, don't stop," Willow said gently as her muscles began
to
relax and she began to feel almost human.  "If you keep this up, I
just
might be normal in two or three days."</p>

<p>"Normal is good," replied Buffy, "however, I'm looking to get you back
in
shape sooner than that.  After all, I need my snuggle monster for
tonight."</p>

<p>"Nuzzle good, cuddle better," said the redhead, "but I can think of
other
things to do."
"Here I thought you were dysfunctional," retorted Buffy.
"Sore yes, dysfunctional no," replied Willow as she turned towards her
soul
mate and drew her lips towards her own for a long, lingering kiss.</p>

<p>"That was very nice," said the slayer a few minutes later, "however,
I've
got even a better idea."</p>

<p>"What's that," asked Willow as she tried to nuzzle her lover, without
getting a mouthful of water in the process.</p>

<p>"Why don't we finish getting clean, then I'll massage your sore
parts,"
replied the blond woman, "then we can see about getting sticky and
dirty
before dinner."</p>

<p>"Goody, I'm up for sticky stuff," replied Willow, "that's a great plan."</p>

<p>They quickly finished their bath and after towelling off, proceeded
naked
into the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Quick girl up on the bed," ordered Buffy, "and present me back," she
continued with mock gravity.</p>

<p>"Yes boss," replied Willow, "but don't you want to massage me first?"</p>

<p>"Enough lip," retorted the other, "I am going to start with massaging
you."</p>

<p>Buffy got up on top of the other woman and began to work the ointment
she
had been given into the stiff and sore muscles of her lover.  It
started to
have an immediate effect on her as Buffy could visibly see some of
the
bruising and swelling leave Willow's back.</p>

<p>"Damn, this is good stuff," thought the slayer, "these people has
some
impressive medical knowledge."</p>

<p>Buffy turned around on Willow's back and began to rub and massage the
ointment into her legs, taking care to ensure that she worked all of
the
soreness out of the muscles, she knew from experience that if she didn't
it
would be difficult the following day for the other woman to get up and
walk.</p>

<p>"Feels, nice" murmured Willow, "don't stop."</p>

<p>Buffy had no intention of stopping, given that she was becoming very
stimulated by what she was doing.  Here she was, buck naked sitting on
top
of her equally naked lover's back massaging her legs. In fact, Buffy
began
to feel a familiar wetness between her legs.</p>

<p>The massage was having a similar effect on Willow.  She was feeling
safe,
and secure, knowing that there was nothing to fear from the woman who was
on
top of her. "Humm," she thought, "I was just thinking."</p>

<p>"Dangerous habit," replied Buffy, "could lead to unknown situations."</p>

<p>"No, its just that it's been one hell of a day," said Willow.</p>

<p>"How's that."</p>

<p>"Its just that its been less than a day since you left on patrol and I
began
to get ready for the Imbolg ritual."</p>

<p>"You're right," the slayer continued as she gently, but firmly, turned
her
lover over so that she could continue working on her muscles.  "So
much has
happened it feels like weeks."</p>

<p>Willow was presented with a vision from her dreams; sitting on top of
her
belly was her lover.  Willow could see the strong muscles in Buffy's
back
and shoulder ripple as Buffy continued to work on her legs.  It was
a
stimulating experience, and Willow could feel, and see her nipples
harden.
It was time for some direct action.  She slowly began to trace her
fingers
over the slayer's muscles, and was pleased to see the small hairs on
her
lover's back stiffen.
Carefully sitting up, she began to nuzzle Buffy's neck and continued
with
soft kisses and gentle licks to her neck and ears.</p>

<p>"Mumm, you taste and smell wonderful," she said as she slowly moved
her
hands around the other woman's side to cup her breasts.</p>

<p>"Someone is excited," she commented softly.</p>

<p>"You should talk," Buffy replied, "since I can feel your nipples
pressing
into my back."</p>

<p>Buffy bent forward and began to kiss Willow's feet and ankles. Willow
continued moving her hands forward and down towards the cleft between
her
lover's legs.  The slayer cooperated by moving her kisses up Willow's
legs,
which had the simultaneous result of moving her sex towards Willow's
willing
lips.  Willow was shortly presented with the object of her desire, and
was
pleased to notice that her soul-mates clitoris and labia were swollen
with
desire.</p>

<p>"Yummy," the arch-mage thought as she proceeded to gently kiss and lick
her
lover's sex, eliciting a sharp intake of breath form the slayer.</p>

<p>"Damn it girl," she said, "you know I love it when you do that."</p>

<p>"I know," Willow replied, taking a quick break from her activities,</p>

<p>"I
notice that you are practically dripping, was that my doing?"</p>

<p>"Less talk, more action," Buffy replied as she bent down between
Willow's
legs and gently blew on her swollen clitoris, Willow moaned deep into
Buffy
groin, since she had been licking and kissing Buffy's labia and clitoris
at
the time.</p>

<p>The two women fell into mutual pleasure, mostly out of their love for
each
other but also, in no small measure, as a release from the tensions
that
they had been under for the last day.  As their lovemaking continued
into
the afternoon, the two women became covered in sweat and other bodily
fluids, just as had been promised by Buffy.</p>

<p>"I just love it when your plans work," murmured Willow to a sleeping
slayer,
just before she too fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>Later that evening there was a discrete knock of the suits door.
Hearing no
response from within the rooms Aiofe softly opened the door calling
out,
"Buffy, Willow, time to get ready for dinner."</p>

<p>Aiofe and Bridie entered the rooms and went over to the bedroom where
they
saw the two travellers entangled together on the rumpled bedclothes.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Bridie called again, "time to get up for dinner."</p>

<p>"Shush," said Aiofe, "let them sleep.  We will go and tell Amana that
they
are deep in sleep, and that we will bring up some food later for
them."</p>

<p>With that, the two young women left the room and carefully closed the
door
behind them.
"Today was hard enough on them," commented Bridie, "and the next few are
not
going to get any better.  They will need all of the rest they can
get."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Far away, in the demon's stronghold, a pensive master demon sat in
his
office.  Scattered at his feet were the remains of a green imp like
demon,
and the remains of Kratel's boss.</p>

<p>"Told them to get answers," the demon thought, "what do they bring back,
but
fantastic stories of a girl with super speed and strength,
incompetents,
they deserved my wrath."</p>

<p>"But," he continued, "what if they were right?"</p>

<p>"Answers," he continued aloud,  "I need answers, all of the plans we
have
worked on for millennia are focused at this point in time, I can't
have
unknown variables in play now."</p>

<p>He stood up and began to pace, "Humm, got to get this mess cleaned
up."
Stopping suddenly the demon thought, "bold action was not the answer,
I've
still got a little time.  I will just have to wait to see what my
humanoid
servants come up with."</p>

<p>With that, the demon strode out of his office screaming for his servants
to
attend him.</p>
