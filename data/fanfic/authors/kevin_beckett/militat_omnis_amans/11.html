<p align=center>When you feel all alone<br>
And the world has turned its back on you<br>
Give me a moment please to tame your wild wild heart<br>
I know you feel like the walls are closing in on you<br>
It's hard to find relief and people can be so cold<br>
When darkness is upon your door and you feel like<br>
you can't take anymore</p>

<p align=center>Let me be the one you call<br>
If you jump I'll break your fall<br>
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night<br>
If you need to fall apart<br>
I can mend a broken heart<br>
If you need to crash then crash and burn<br>
You're not alone</p>

<p>Buffy sighed deeply.  The afternoon sun was, for once this summer, very warm and she had taken advantage of the good weather by lying on a blanket, stark naked, eyes closed, soaking up the rays.  "Got to get working on my tan," she thought to herself, "I'm beginning to look like an alabaster sculpture."</p>

<p>"A pregnant sculpture at that," added Willow, as she came out of the cottage carrying a tray with a pitcher of ice-tea along with two glasses.</p>

<p>&lt;Reading my mind again?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Yep, forgive me?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Always.&gt;</p>

<p>Willow suddenly had an impish thought.  Leaning over her lover, she began to dribble the ice-tea over Buffy's expanding abdomen. Buffy squealed in surprise as the cold liquid touched her heated skin.</p>

<p>"Red, you're a witch!"</p>

<p>"Guilty as charged," replied Willow, as she placed the tray on the ground before joining Buffy on the blanket, "I'm so happy I just couldn't resist."</p>

<p>"If you are so happy then pour me a drink," said Buffy as she sat up, slowly, "Umph, this is getting to be a bit more difficult."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Willow, as she poured each of them a glass of tea, before lying back, resting her glass on her belly and saying, "I look like a beached whale."</p>

<p>Buffy leaned over and lightly kissed Willow's tummy before replying, "a beautiful beached whale."</p>

<p>Both women were now into their twenty-fourth week of pregnancy, and thanks to a combination of good diet and a daily exercise routine were feeling very comfortable at this stage of their gravidity.  Amana had told them, that once they hit the third trimester, in two or three weeks, they would begin to feel more uncomfortable as their babies grew and began to run out of room.</p>

<p>"I'm not beautiful," replied the arch-mage, "I'm bloated."</p>

<p>"Not true.  I happen to think that you are the most beautiful preggo, this side of the mountain."</p>

<p>"Aside from you," retorted Willow, "I'm the only preggo this side of the mountain, so that's not saying much, now is it."</p>

<p>"Well, I happen to think you're beautiful.  Besides, you're forgetting Aiofe and Bridie."</p>

<p>"Then I thank-you for your astute observational sense," replied Willow, as she drew down her lover for another kiss, "I happen to think that you are quite radiant yourself.  And they don't really count yet since they are not even a month along."</p>

<p>"Its unanimous then," replied the slayer, "we're both beautiful, since we both think that way, and, after all, our opinions are the only ones that counts."</p>

<p>Both women returned to their sunbathing, enjoying their rest in the relaxing sunshine.  The sun, along with the fact that there was absolutely nothing that they had to do before getting their dinner ready, put the two of them into a peaceful frame of mind.</p>

<p>"I'm going to miss this," said Buffy.</p>

<p>"So am I," replied her lover, "one more week, then back to the millstone."</p>

<p>They were thoroughly enjoying their honeymoon.  They had had the opportunity to sleep, relax and enjoy each other's company, without any pressures on their time.  This had resulted in their being totally comfortable and relaxed for the first time since they had arrived on this world, perhaps since even earlier.</p>

<p>"The twins are certainly happy with the sun," commented Buffy, as she felt her baby moving once again, "or maybe its just because we are so relaxed."</p>

<p>"Whatever," replied Willow, "I'm just glad we finally recognized the movement for what it was, I was beginning to worry a little bit."</p>

<p>Both women had begun to feel their babies' movement shortly after starting their honeymoon.  They had gone through a period of alerting each other as soon as they felt the movement, only to notice that both babies seemed to be moving at the same time.  They attributed this particular oddity to just one more strange thing about their pregnancies.</p>

<p>"This 'gift' of Amana's was perfect," commented Buffy, as she watched puffy white clouds drift lazily across the sky.</p>

<p>"No kidding," replied Willow, "I've not felt this relaxed in a long time. Besides our little hideaway is just perfect."</p>

<p>The cottage that Amana had arranged for them was a sheepherder's summer cottage, temporarily vacated for the occasion, which had been built more than eighty years earlier.  It was located to the north of the village, and was near the high summer pastures that the villagers used for their sheep.  A small stream ran on the far side of the dooryard, about thirty meters away, providing a source of fresh, cold, clean water.  It had a large vegetable garden, which provided fresh herbs and produce, along with several ornamental gardens, providing homes for the countless butterflies and songbirds.  The house itself had three-foot thick masonry walls, covered in climbing ivy, and a slate roof; these were more than capable of keeping out the rain, sleet and the cold. This was fortunate, since the weather had been miserable for the last two weeks, with rain and sleet heralding the imminent end of the short summer season in the high mountains.  Not that the newlyweds had really noticed the weather, having spent a good portion of their time in the cottage, in bed.</p>

<p>The cottage only had three rooms; a very large and comfortable bedroom, an equally large bathroom and an enormous common room that functioned as kitchen, dining room, living room and study.  Each room had several large windows, providing the primary source of light.  In addition, there was a fireplace in each room, which provided heat and a secondary source of illumination. Their honeymoon home was also fully furnished; with furnishings that were both comfortable and practical.</p>

<p>In order to keep them in provisions, every couple of days Aiofe and Bridie had visited to deliver fresh food, in addition to keeping them apprised of any pressing news back in the village.  Luckily, so far, there had been no problems that would require the attention of either the slayer or the arch-mage.</p>

<p>"Now doesn't that look too good for words," said Aiofe, as she and Bridie approached the two drowsy women on the ground, both of them carrying two bundles in addition to a backpack.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that if there were words," replied Willow dryly, "that you would be the one to find them."</p>

<p>"Now is that any way to speak to the people bringing your dinner," asked Bridie as the two new arrivals placed their bundles on the ground.</p>

<p>"What's all that," asked Buffy, noticing that there were six very large bundles on the ground, "I don't think that we could eat all of that in two days, pregnant or not."</p>

<p>"Its for the week," replied Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Come again," asked Willow, just a little confused and beginning to get a little worried.</p>

<p>"Not only that," added Bridie, "its also for the four of us."</p>

<p>"What happened to aloneness," asked Buffy, also becoming a bit worried about this sudden change in plans.</p>

<p>"Its like this," replied Bridie, "Daithi received some troubling news yesterday, and Grael and Amana decided that it would be prudent if Aiofe and I resumed our bodyguard duties."</p>

<p>"Not that I mind the way that you two guard our bodies, but, spill the details," ordered Willow, changing from relaxed young woman to war leader in a heartbeat, "just what was the news?"</p>

<p>Aiofe and Bridie then related the news that had come into the village on the previous day.  A small band of travellers had arrived with tales of a demon army that was working its way through the area, burning out the villages, and torturing, interrogating and massacring the inhabitants.  The refugees had indicated that they were from a village no more than thirty kilometres away, and that the demons appeared to be looking for a small group of mages and warriors. Grael and Amana had immediately come to the conclusion that Willow's strike force was the group that the demons were looking for; it appeared that the army they had eluded months earlier had finally come closer to finding them.</p>

<p>"No more running," Willow said, the steel in her voice able to cut the tension that had sprung up, and, agreeing with Amana and Grael's assessment of the intentions of the demon army, continued, "whatever happens, we will not be driven out of this valley alive."</p>

<p>"I agree," added the slayer, "we've made a home here, besides we won't have time to find somewhere else before winter."</p>

<p>"Well then," said Bridie, "you'll be happy to know that everyone else agrees with you."</p>

<p>"Now," added Buffy, "just why are the two of you here, and why are we not all heading back to town?"</p>

<p>"Daithi and Grael have asked Aiofe and I to take a look around this area," replied Bridie, "and since there has been no real confirmation of the demon threat, Amana indicated that you two should stay here and continue to enjoy your honeymoon."</p>

<p>"We brought our camping stuff," added Aiofe, "so we will not be a bother to you. We'll just camp out here."</p>

<p>"Not on your life," retorted Willow, "you two will stay in the cottage with us. Furthermore, there is no way that you are going to stop me, let alone Buffy, from going along to help you look for these demons."</p>

<p>"But..." said Aiofe, "you are supposed to be on your vacation."</p>

<p>"No buts," replied Willow, the steel in her voice now reflected in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Buffy, after a moments pause, "now that that is settled, lets see about getting you two settled in."</p>

<p>The four women proceeded to collect the various packages that were on the ground and went into the cottage to unpack.  Once Aiofe and Bridie had unpacked, Willow noticed that the weather had turned for the worse.  Thick black clouds had rolled in over the mountains, with a major summer storm threatening to break at any moment.</p>

<p>"Well there goes the nice weather," lamented Willow, looking out of the large windows in the common room, "summer was nice while it lasted."</p>

<p>"This sucks," agreed Buffy, "we get one nice day, and the sun only stays around for a couple of hours."</p>

<p>Suddenly the sky blackened even further as a tremendous electrical storm struck the valley.  Massive chains of lightning lit the sky, followed by the rumble of thunder, shaking the mountains and the foundations of the cottage.  The temperature plummeted with the arrival of the storm, where it had been in the high twenties it was now in the low teens and falling fast.</p>

<p>"This is nuts," commented Buffy, "I was nice and comfy, broiling in the sun, now I'm freezing."   She left the common room, where they had been all watching the storm, and went to the bedroom to get dressed in warm clothing.  Returning a few minutes later she saw that Willow was still standing at the window with the others, naked, transfixed by the storm.</p>

<p>"This is great," gushed Willow, "I just love these storms.  Mother Nature at her most elemental."</p>

<p>"Well lover," responded Buffy, noticing that her lover was beginning to turn blue with cold, "if we don't get some warm clothes on you soon you are going to catch your death of cold."</p>

<p>"Party pooper," complained Willow, as Buffy picked her up and carried her back into the bedroom to get dressed.  Meanwhile, Aiofe and Bridie took that as a sign and busied themselves by building up the fires, to bring the ambient temperature in the cottage back to something approaching normal.</p>

<p>After making the cottage a bit more comfortable, and doing what little tidying needed to be done, the four young women then set to making themselves a hearty stew for dinner.  Since the weather precluded any further activities outdoors, after dinner they sat before the fire discussing life, and their plans for the next few days.</p>

<p>"So," asked Buffy, "what 'suggestions', did Daithi offer?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Bridie, "both he and Grael suggested that we look to the north. Apparently there are some passes with small rivers in them which could allow an army an easy route to our little valley."</p>

<p>"They also indicated that there was another large valley to the north, that has a small hamlet in it," added Aiofe, "which could be used as a staging site for an army."</p>

<p>"How far away is this valley," asked Willow.</p>

<p>"About two days," replied Aiofe.</p>

<p>"I still don't like the idea of the two of you coming along," said Bridie, "its supposed to be your honeymoon, not work time."</p>

<p>"That's been settled," said the arch-mage, "we're going.  Besides there is no confirmed threat, so it won't really be work, it's more like a road trip. Only on foot."</p>

<p>"What's more," added Buffy, "with the pregnancies and winter and all, its probably the last chance we'll get to see some of the surrounding area."</p>

<p>"Ok then, that's settled," said Willow. "I suggest that we head out tomorrow morning, check out the passes and then double back checking the other valley on the way."</p>

<p>"Take what," asked Buffy, "three, maybe four days."</p>

<p>"Way I figure it," agreed the arch-mage, "that way we could still have a couple days here to relax before heading back to the village, the inn and our real work of finding a permanent solution to this demon problem."</p>

<p>The four young women spent the evening in conversation, with the topics ranging from serious discussions on magic, slaying and the demon war to less weighty concerns about baby names and favourite foods.</p>

<p>"Chocolate, I'm dying for some chocolate," said Willow at one point, "I can't believe that no one on this world was able to figure out what to do with the cocoa plant and invent chocolate.  Now it's too late, what with the crappy weather and this little demon problem we're having."</p>

<p>As if to highlight the weather problems, just then there was a massive flash of light right outside of the cottage, followed immediately by the crack of thunder.</p>

<p>"That was close," commented Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Too close," agreed Bridie, "I think that it was right outside of the door."</p>

<p>Willow's eyes glazed over for a moment after which she said, "Shadow-cat is very not-happy.  She's right outside and wants to get in."</p>

<p>"I'll get it," said Buffy, as she stood up to go to the door.  Once she had opened it, a black and grey streak shot into the room, heading for Willow and the fire.  She stopped in front of the fireplace and began to shake the water out of her fur, in the process splattering everyone.</p>

<p>"Shadow-Cat," scolded Willow gently, "stop that."</p>

<p>"Merrow," replied the cat indignantly, after which she proceeded to curl up before the fire, grooming the remainder of the water out of her fur.</p>

<p>"That is one unhappy puddy tat," commented Buffy, "what's she thinking about?"</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Willow, with a little smile, "she is happier now, but I think that she's going to be sticking closer to home for the next little while.  No more roaming the heath for her."</p>

<p>"What about when we head out to search the surrounding area," asked Aiofe, "what will you do about her?"</p>

<p>"She'll be fine here," answered Willow, "We'll leave a window open so she can get out and hunt.  There is plenty of fresh water nearby.  If we need to, she'll know where I am, so she can find us."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," said Buffy, "why don't we all head off to bed, so we can get an early start tomorrow."</p>

<p>The four young women headed off to the bedroom, leaving Willow's familiar alone before the fire.  She continued to groom, eventually ridding herself of the water on, and in, her fir.  Arching her back in a graceful stretch she thought, "stay here, or go to my human."  Shadow-cat looked at the inviting fire, with the soft chair pulled up before it, and made her decision by leaping up onto the chair and preceded to curl up, purring, in the centre of the cushion thinking, "human mating is so messy.  I'll wait till they fall asleep, then take my rightful place on the bed."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the cottage, the four young women were indeed demonstrating that human mating could be messy.  Willow and Buffy had fallen upon the other two, like lions on a pair of wounded lambs, and had begun to thoroughly ravish their friends.</p>

<p>"Mmmmm," purred Buffy, as she slowly licked, and kissed, her way down Aiofe's back, "fresh flesh, gota love fresh flesh."</p>

<p>"I'd have to agree," commented Willow, as she proceeded to lightly trail her fingers up the inside of Bridie's leg, "its been two weeks since we've had a chance to sample these particular delicacies."</p>

<p>"Too long," agreed Buffy, who proceeded to gently pry Aiofe's legs apart, so that she could continue her trail of kisses, which were leading, inexorably, towards her centre.</p>

<p>"Damn, you are so good at this," whispered Aiofe huskily, as she tried to retain some composure.</p>

<p>"I know," replied the slayer, "practice does make one perfect you know."</p>

<p>&lt;And just who have you been practicing on now?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Just you my love.  Well, I guess also Aiofe and Bridie here.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy reached between the other woman's legs, searching for, and finding her pleasure button.  Twirling Aiofe's clitoris between her thumb and forefinger Buffy asked softly, "you want me to stop?"</p>

<p>"Goddess no," panted Aiofe, "don't you dare stop now."</p>

<p>Willow, who was performing similar actions on Bridie, had a thought, &lt;lover.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Yes.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Lets try to get them to come simultaneously.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Great idea! But lets prolong it as long as possible.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow then proceeded to work in concert on the other women. Using their fingers, tongues and magic they began to stimulate and pleasure their friends.  They timed every move, they brought each woman to a peak, then paused allowing the anticipated climax to fade.  They worked as a team for nearly an hour, in perfect synchronization.  It almost became a game, as Aiofe and Bridie tried everything to achieve their orgasms, while Buffy and Willow did everything they could to delay them.  The work that Buffy and Willow were doing was beginning to have an expected effect on them as well.  Their pulses began to race, their skin became flush, and the sweat began to run off their bodies as the clefts between their legs began to run with the juice of their excitement. Finally, neither Buffy nor Willow could maintain the delicate balance, between anticipation and release, any longer and the four women exploded in a mutual orgasm, that peaked, then peaked again.</p>

<p>They lay on the bed, exhausted as Buffy and Willow's foetuses did a routine of isometric uterine exercises, as a counterpoint of harmonic aftershocks to the just concluded exertions.</p>

<p>"This is intense," commented Willow, noticing the vigorous exercise of her baby.</p>

<p>"I'd have to agree," added Buffy, "they do seem to have enjoyed our little pleasure trip."</p>

<p>"Not as much as these two though," replied the arch-mach, motioning to the nearly comatose bodies of Aiofe and Bridie, "I didn't think that we would be able to keep it up as long as we did; but, I'm so glad we did."</p>

<p>"So are we," agreed Aiofe, as she tried, and failed, to sit up on the bed, "if it's alright by you, I think that we are going to sleep now."</p>

<p>"Fine by me," answered Buffy, as she and Willow snuggled together and also fell into a deep, peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>Moments later the door to the bedroom was nosed open, followed by the entrance of Shadow-Cat, who, as she jumped up to her usual place on the bed, thought, "now I can get some proper sleep."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The next morning, back in the village of Morning Breeze, life was progress as best it could, given the circumstances of war.  Amana, Grael, Frankel and Daithi were in the common room of the inn, enjoying a leisurely breakfast while they attended to the few administrative chores that they were responsible for in Willow's absence.</p>

<p>"Is that it then," asked Amana, looking around the table at the others, "are we done for the day?"</p>

<p>"Lets just go over the list to make sure," said Grael.</p>

<p>"Ok," replied Daithi, "Sonya and the rest of the recent arrivals will be continuing their training this morning.  After lunch, they will continue to work on the renovations needed on the third floor."  Daithi paused for a moment then added, "I think that you should come and take a look at their progress this morning, it's been remarkable."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," answered Grael, "we'll do that.  Meanwhile, Amana and I are going to continue to work on the inventories and determining what additional supplies we are going to need for the winter."</p>

<p>"Padrick and I will be checking out the southern pass this afternoon," continued Daithi, "to see if there has been any sign of demons."</p>

<p>"And I will continue interviewing the villagers, to see if they have heard of any additional demon sightings from any of their relatives in any of the neighbouring villages," said Frankel.</p>

<p>"Looks like we covered everything," said Amana, "let's get to it then."</p>

<p>Everyone stood up from the table, to head off to their various tasks.  As she pushed in her chair, Amana turned to Daithi and said, "if its ok with you, I think that we should take a look at Sonya and the rest now."</p>

<p>"Ok with me," replied the guards captain, "they should be just finishing up their warm-up exercises about now."</p>

<p>They left the inn, heading to a barn at the end of the complex, which had been converted to a training centre for the guards.  As they approached the building, they could hear the sounds of steel striking steel.</p>

<p>"Looks like they have started on the drills already," said Daithi as he held open the door for Amana and Grael, "I think that you will find this very interesting."</p>

<p>"Is it what you wanted to show us," asked Grael.</p>

<p>"In part," replied the other man, as he led them to the edge of the practice arena that had been erected in the centre of the old post and beam structure.</p>

<p>They watched the sparing, Amana and Grael in awe.  In the middle of the arena was one of the newcomers; Amana remembered that her name was Elizabeth.  She was currently facing two of Daithi's guardsmen and more than holding her own. Elizabeth was parrying every attack, and even managing to make an occasional attack of her own.</p>

<p>"This is remarkable," commented Grael, "were they all this accomplished before arriving here?"</p>

<p>"She's picked this up in the last two weeks," replied Daithi, "they all have."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said Amana, stunned by the implications, "this level of skill takes months of constant practice to achieve."</p>

<p>"Believe, me I know that," replied Daithi, "but two weeks ago none of them even knew how to hold a sword properly."</p>

<p>"I wish I understood this development," said Grael softly, "but I don't."</p>

<p>"Do you think we should we send for Willow or Buffy," asked Amana, concerned by her lover's uncertainty, "is it something that needs their immediate attention?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Grael, "I don't think so.  We still need them to check out the northern passes, besides, there isn't anything overtly dangerous about Sonya and the rest of them developing military skills quickly now is there?"  Grael had known that once Willow had found out about the mission that had been given to Aiofe and Bridie that she would insist on going along, taking Buffy with her.</p>

<p>"No.  Not overtly," replied Daithi carefully, "but I can't help but think that if they continue to develop their skills at this rate that they all will soon be as capable as Buffy is.  Without her magic and enhanced genetics though."</p>

<p>"Now that is something we will can discuss tonight with Frankel," said Amana, "he is certain to have some incite on this matter.  Now, however, Grael and I have some inventories with our names on them, and you, I think, have some advanced training sessions to plan for these remarkable students."</p>

<p>Later that evening, after everyone else had finished their dinner and had retired for the evening, Amana, Grael, Daithi and Frankel met in what had now been named Willow's dining room in order to discuss the remarkable capability with weapons that Sonya and the other newcomers had demonstrated to Amana and Grael earlier in the day.  Sonya had been asked to remain behind in the common room in case there was a need to question her.</p>

<p>"This is remarkable," said Frankel, for the tenth time since he had been informed of the fighting abilities of Sonya and her travelling companions.</p>

<p>"So you have said," replied Grael, "but that still does not answer the questions of how and why."</p>

<p>"But that is obvious," answered Frankel, "I was certain you had already determined the answers to those questions this morning."</p>

<p>"What's obvious," said Amana, the irritation in her voice leaking through, "and would you be so kind as to share it with us?"</p>

<p>"But," said Frankel, "its obvious that Sonya and her companions are our world's slayers."</p>

<p>"What," asked Daithi, who was very confused, "what do you mean slayers."</p>

<p>"Like Buffy," replied Frankel, "these young women are our worlds slayers, or our primary defence against the demons."</p>

<p>"But," interjected Grael, "it was my understanding that there was a 'Watcher's Council' or something to train the slayer, and that there was only one slayer at a time."</p>

<p>"That was my understanding as well," agreed the sage, "but if you stop to think about it, it doesn't make all that much sense."</p>

<p>"Say again," said Amana, who was also beginning to become a little confused.</p>

<p>"Lets look at what Buffy has told us," continued Frankel, launching into instructor mode, "first, there is this counsel, made up of a large number of people, who are responsible for training and watching the slayer, yes."</p>

<p>"That is my understanding," said Grael.</p>

<p>"Ok, then," said Frankel, "then why do they have such a large number of watchers, if there is only one slayer?  Second, what are the rest of the counsel members doing, if they are not required to train slayers?  I know Buffy told us about the maintenance of libraries and researching prophecies, but how many people do you think that could take?  Third, do you really think that only one slayer would be sufficient to handle the demon problem on any world, even one such as Buffy's with its limited infestation?"</p>

<p>"Good questions, all of them," said Daithi, "do you have any theories, or answers?"</p>

<p>"Nothing concrete," replied the sage, "but I have a couple of ideas.  First, I think that there are a number of slayers on every world, however, for some reason, on Buffy's world, each is told that they are the only one.  Second, we have circumstantial evidence that Buffy's genetic makeup was altered before she was born, leading me to think that this counsel is involved in some greater game."</p>

<p>"So what do we do," asked Amana, "after all, they are on another world, and we are here."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the older man, "I will want to discuss this some more with both Buffy and Willow once they return.  I'm convinced it is important, but maybe only when they return to their home world.  Maybe my insights will help them deal with whatever problems they will have once they return."</p>

<p>"That will have to wait until they return," replied Amana, "and until we have solved our own little problems with demons."</p>

<p>"Now, lets get back to our current situation," said Grael, "and lets get Sonya in here for a few questions before we wrap things up for the night."</p>

<p>Daithi left the small room and returned a moment latter with Sonya.  Sonya was visibly nervous to have been called before so many of her elders, but tried her best to hide her fear.</p>

<p>"Yes lady, and lords," she said, after she had been gestured to sit in a free chair before the fireplace, "what may I do to assist you?"</p>

<p>"Its ok child," said Frankel reassuringly, "you've done nothing wrong.  We only need you to answer a few questions."</p>

<p>"Ok," replied the young woman carefully.</p>

<p>"We would like to talk about the remarkable skill that you, and your travelling companions, have shown with weapons," said Amana, initiating the conversation, "you have told Daithi that before you arrived here you had never used a sword before in your life, is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Yes lady," replied Sonya softly.</p>

<p>"You may call me Amana dear," replied the other woman, "now do you have any idea why you have gained your skills so rapidly?"</p>

<p>"Well, Amana," replied Sonya, "me and the other girls have discussed this, at least a little bit."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"Well, its like everything we are doing is natural.  Daithi or the other guardsmen only have to explain something once, and it's as if we have always known about it.  Our bodies just seem to move in the right way, after we are shown a skill, then it's as if we always knew how."</p>

<p>"Can you think of any reason why this is so," asked Grael.</p>

<p>"No lord," replied the younger woman, "as best I can figure, all of us are from farming or crafter families.  None of my brothers, or my father, was ever in the military."</p>

<p>"We know that you knew none of the other girls before you met them down the mountain," said Amana, "is that true for the others?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Amana," answered the younger woman, "and as you know, we've come from all parts of the country."</p>

<p>"Interesting," said the sage, as he stroked his long beard, "almost as if there continues to be some sort of Devine assistance going on here."</p>

<p>"That speculation can wait a week or so until Buffy and Willow return," said Grael, "this is a development that Willow will have to address, so I think that we should table this discussion till they return.  Now, lets us all head off for the baths and bed."</p>

<p>There was a consensus that Grael's idea was excellent, and the group all headed off for passage leading from the inn to the bath complex.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Elsewhere in the mountains, far to the north of the village, the leaders of the demon force hunting for Willow were sitting around their campfire, discussing their plans for the next few days.</p>

<p>"Well the last two weeks haven't accomplished much," complained Hugh, as he stirred the fire with a long branch, trying to coax a little more heat from it, "none of the villagers we've tortured knew anything about that damned witch or the slayer."</p>

<p>"At least it made the troops happy," said Junulak, "that does account for something."</p>

<p>"But it still hasn't brought us any closer to our goal," replied Talor, "and if anything our activities may have alerted our prey to our existence."</p>

<p>"Need I remind you two that attacking the villages was your idea," said Junulak, his voice ringing with steel, "I agreed with you, yes, but it was your idea, so no more complaints about lack of progress.  Now, lets take a look at the map and I show you my ideas for what we are going to do next."</p>

<p>Junulak unrolled a large parchment, which was a detailed map of the territory they were in.  The three demons spent some time looking over the map and familiarizing themselves with the various villages and natural features detailed on it.</p>

<p>"They way I see it," said Junulak, pointing out a hamlet and a mountain pass, "we have to check out both this hamlet, and the farmsteads along this pass here. Then, the way will be clear to focus on this village at the end of this valley." Junulak concluded his mini-briefing by pointing out the village of Morning Breeze.</p>

<p>"Going to take some time," commented Hugh, "if we check out the hamlet, then the pass it's going to take at least two weeks, maybe more."</p>

<p>"Not my plan," replied Junulak, "I want to speed this up, before our master takes an interest in us, so I'm going to split our forces.  Hugh, you are going to take half the troops and check out the pass, while Talor and I will take the remainder and takeout the hamlet.  We will meet at the north end of this valley in one weeks time."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," said Hugh, "I'll leave at first light.</p>

<p>"I think that this is our last chance," commented Junulak, "if we don't get some information, soon, our master will be certain to take an unpleasant interest in us."</p>

<p>"That is something we want to avoid," said Talor, shivering at the thought, "let's prey that we find some answers in our efforts."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Not that far from where the demon leadership was having their strategy session, four young women were in the process of setting up their campsite for the evening.  They were at the southern end of a long mountain pass, which had a fast flowing stream running down its centre, with steep forested cliffs running parallel to the stream.  The stream had cut a wide plane through the mountains; there was approximately twenty meters of open mountain meadows on either side of the stream, testimony to the extent of the spring flooding, before reaching the edge of the cliff faces.  The stream was the same one that wandered by the cottage; the foursome had followed it as a starting point for their investigations into demon activity in the area.  It was cold, the temperature hovering at the freezing point, and there was a light dusting of fresh snow decorating the mountain pines and the meadow in which they had chosen to camp.</p>

<p>"This sucks," commented Willow, echoing her life-mates comment of the previous day.</p>

<p>"No kidding," agreed Buffy, trying for the fifth time to erect the tent that the four of them would be using. "This demented excuse for a tent is possessed. It refuses to stay together."</p>

<p>"Now, you know its not possessed," replied Willow with a laugh, while arranging a circle of stones for their fire, "its just that you are mechanically challenged."</p>

<p>"I am so not mechanically challenged," retorted the slayer, "I'd get this blasted thing to stay together if my fingers weren't freezing off my hand."</p>

<p>"What, the tent not up yet," commented Aiofe, as she and Bridie entered the campsite, each carrying a load of firewood.</p>

<p>"No," replied Buffy frostily, "its not up yet."</p>

<p>"Here let me help you," said Bridie, as she deposited her load of wood beside Willow's fire pit before going over to Buffy, starting her assistance by rubbing some warmth into the slayer's hands.  "I told you that you should be wearing your gloves, now where are they?"</p>

<p>"In my backpack," replied Buffy, "its just that I'm not ready to wear gloves in July."</p>

<p>"But you are ready to have them freeze," responded Bridie, pulling the leather and fur gloves onto Buffy's hands, "that doesn't make any sense now does it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right," grumbled Buffy, flexing her fingers to try to get the circulation going.</p>

<p>Within minutes everything was in order.  Willow had finished making the fireplace, and had built up a large cheery fire in it.  She had also dragged a large fallen tree next to the fire pit, to be used for seating.  Bridie and Buffy had finally managed to set up the tent, while Aiofe put together a simple dinner of soup and bread.  They were all sitting close together, and close to the fire, to ward off the chill temperatures.</p>

<p>"We are going to freeze tonight," commented Buffy, "once we leave this fire we are going to turn into popsicles."</p>

<p>"Nope," replied Aiofe, "we will be nice and warm."</p>

<p>"How," asked Willow, "what are we going to do for heat?"</p>

<p>"Simple," answered Bridie, "our sleeping bag is down-filled, and it has a series of pockets running along the outside edge of it."</p>

<p>"So," queried Buffy.</p>

<p>"So," continued Bridie, "we will take the hot stones from around the fire, and put them in the pockets.  They, combined with our joint body heat, and a few layers of clothing, will keep us warm."</p>

<p>"Cool," said Willow, "that is one nifty idea."</p>

<p>The four women sat in silence, watching the figures dancing in the flames, and the sparks, thrown up by the cracking of the logs, as they leaped up into the air to join the billions of stars in the crystal clear moon-dark sky.  The four of them had become more than comfortable with each other, and worded communication was often no longer necessary.  They could therefore sit in silence, not needing to fill the breathtaking surroundings with needless words, each of them contemplating their own thoughts.</p>

<p>Willow, allowed her mind to wander, secure in the knowledge that she was among friends and safe.  She thought about the tremendous events that had happened to her over the last six months and how her life would never be the same, even if she and Buffy managed to make it back 'home' somehow.  She realized that even though she missed her earth tremendously, sometimes, deep in the night when she was the only one awake, to the point of tears, that as long as she had Buffy, she was in fact 'home'.  As she continued her musings she began to understand that for her, 'home' now also included Aiofe and Bridie, in addition to her life-mate.  Willow was now having, consciously, the same thoughts that she had previously only expressed subconsciously, in particular during the dream that Buffy had witnessed over four months earlier, just before they had been driven into the mountains.  Willow was curious to see if the others shared her feelings.  "I've been thinking," she said, breaking the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>"Dangerous," replied the other three women simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Buffy and I are bound to each other forever," continued Willow, ignoring the sarcasm by the others, "and that will never change, but, I've been wondering how all of you feel about the relationship between the four of us."</p>

<p>"What do you mean sweetheart," asked Buffy, realizing where the conversation was leading, but wanting to give her lover an out, if she needed it.</p>

<p>"Well," started Willow carefully, "I think that I've come to the realization that Aiofe and Bridie are more than good friends, and more than 'family', and I was wondering how everyone else saw things."</p>

<p>"Deep thinking," replied Buffy, "I know how I feel, and like most things your soul and mine share the same thoughts.  To be honest, I've been having ideas similar to this for the last few months. Its just that I think that I was afraid to mention them aloud."</p>

<p>Both Buffy and Willow turned expectantly to the other young women, who let out a deep, joint, sigh.</p>

<p>"Buffy," began Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Willow," said Bridie simultaneously.</p>

<p>After a moment, Bridie continued, "ladies, you have touched upon something that Aiofe and I have discussed many times.  We both love you two more than anyone else, and share your insight on the strength and depth of our joined relationships.  We also think of you as more than friends, and more than family, and have grown to love and trust you both very deeply.  That love and trust led us, more than anything else, to asking for your help in making us mothers to be."</p>

<p>"We were hesitant to mention anything directly," added Aiofe, "for fear that you didn't feel the same way, and that you would not want us as a permanent feature in your lives."</p>

<p>"Not that we have really thought that far ahead," added Bridie, "given that recently we haven't had much opportunity to plan beyond the next week or so at any given time."</p>

<p>"Well," said Willow, knowing that she could speak for both herself and for Buffy, "I would be honoured if the two of you could become, as you so nicely put it, 'permanent features' in our lives."</p>

<p>"I do see a problem," said Buffy, "when it comes time for us to leave.  What do we do then, and how do we remain so close?"</p>

<p>"We will find an answer," replied Willow reassuringly.  "Now, group hug time, and maybe some hot cider to celebrate."</p>

<p>The women all embraced and kissed each other softly, each now reassured by the knowledge that their feelings for the other women were reciprocated.  There would be problems and difficulties ahead, particularly when it came time for</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow to leave, but somehow they knew that between them they would find the answers and solve all of their problems.</p>

<p>As Willow was pouring each of them a mug of hot cider, Buffy's slayer sense went off.</p>

<p>"Heads up gals," she said in a whisper, "we've got trouble nearby."</p>

<p>"What's up," asked Willow, the concern obvious in her voice.</p>

<p>"A vamp," replied the slayer, her attention now totally focused on the hunt, and the slay, "not to far away, maybe a hundred meters or so."</p>

<p>"It won't get by our protections," said Willow, referring to the protection ring that she had cast in a ten-meter circle around their campsite, "you could stay, and not worry about it tonight."</p>

<p>"You know that I can't," replied Buffy softly, as she got up from the fire, looking for her weapons, "want to come along?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't miss it," answered Bridie for the other women, "we are here to guard your body after all."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a bellow of rage, which emanated from the far side of the camp, it sounded like a creature in abject pain.</p>

<p>"Sounds like our visitor has found the ring," said Willow, "it looks like he, or she, is not too happy about it either."</p>

<p>"Shall we go and see," asked Buffy, "I must admit, that the hunt is a lot easier when they come to you."</p>

<p>"Better than checking out the graveyards every night," agreed Willow, as she and the other young women formed up behind the slayer to check out who, or what, had yelled in pain.</p>

<p>They quickly crossed the campsite, to an area well behind the tent.  They could see an indistinct figure standing just beyond edge of Willow's protection ring.</p>

<p>"We could do with better light," commented Buffy, "I can't really see what we are dealing with."</p>

<p>"No problemo," replied Willow, who concentrated for a moment then with a softly whispered, "leayrtrys," created a ball of light and set it floating in the air above Buffy's head.  "There we go.  That better," she asked.</p>

<p>"Much, thank you love."</p>

<p>Revealed by Willow's light, was a fully morphed vampire, his face twisted in rage, pacing back and forth, just outside the edge of the protection circle.</p>

<p>"What have you done, you bitches," he yelled, "why can't I get in at you?"</p>

<p>"One track minds," said Buffy, totally ignoring the agitated vampire, "you think that after all of this time I would learn, but I still expect something different."</p>

<p>"What," asked Willow, also ignoring the vampire, "witty conversation, dry humour, discussions on literature or fine art?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, something," replied Buffy, finally turning her attention to the vampire, "oh well, maybe next time.  Now what do we have here?"</p>

<p>Both Aiofe and Bridie were more than a little confused by the banter between Buffy and Willow.  They were faced with what was a major source of fear on their world, and Buffy wasn't showing any signs of concern.  Granted, they knew she was the slayer, and they had seen her in action before, but it was still an eye opening experience to witness the self-confidence of the slayer when she was engaged in her mission.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Willow, "it looks like one really pissed-off vampire, who is nonetheless really stupid to stick around when faced with something totally unknown.  Do you want to simply dust it, or do you think that we should get some info first?"</p>

<p>"It seems such a shame to simply dust him," said Buffy, "after all he did come all this way.  Why don't we ask a few questions first."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," said the arch-mage, "do you want to beat him up first, or simply hold him?"</p>

<p>"Hold him, I think.  After all it is late, I'm cold, and I don't really feel</p>

<p>like spending a lot of time chasing him through the woods and up and down the mountains."</p>

<p>Buffy then cast the same binding spell that she had used before, and once the vampire was totally immobilized, she and the others went up to the now slightly confused, and terrified demon.</p>

<p>"This one is older," commented Willow, walking around the bound demon, "looks to have been around for a while."</p>

<p>"Yep," added Buffy succinctly, also spending a few minutes investigating her prey, "definitely been doing this a while."  She stopped her pacing, stood directly in front of the vampire and addressed him, "hey, fangy.  Before you die, I've a few questions you are going to answer."</p>

<p>"Go to hell, bitch," he replied.  He was an old vampire, having been turned over two hundred years previously, however, he was terrified by this totally unknown experience.  He reacted with bravado, trying to mask his fear.</p>

<p>"No, that particular spot is reserved for your kind," replied the slayer as she swiftly dropkicked the vampire, doubling him over in pain.  "I don't have much time, and we can do this one of two ways; one, you answer my questions, nicely, and then I dust you; or two, you try to resist and I cause you severe pain by slowly ripping off your limbs, then you answer my questions, then I dust you. Now which is it?"</p>

<p>"Shut up, and let me go," replied the vampire, trying to use all of his powers of compulsion, "I need to feed, and you are going to be my meal."</p>

<p>"I rather doubt it," replied Willow, as she watched Buffy calmly walk up to the demon and rip his right arm out of the socket.</p>

<p>The vampire screamed in agony as his arm was removed, "you total bitch," he screamed, "I'm going to get you for that."</p>

<p>"They never learn, do they," asked Buffy turning towards her lover. Retuning her attention to the vampire she proceeded to beat him over his head, with his arm, while saying, "now, are you going to answer my questions, or am I going to continue to remove your limbs?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"There, wasn't that easy," replied the slayer, tossing his arm over her shoulder, "first, are you alone, or are you with the group of demons causing havoc in these mountains?"</p>

<p>"Alone."</p>

<p>"When was the last time you fed on a human?"</p>

<p>"Last week, a farmer and his wife."</p>

<p>"Did you turn them," continued Buffy, pacing back and forth, trying to stay warm, "or just feed?"</p>

<p>"I just fed."</p>

<p>"When was the last time you turned someone," asked Willow, "and where?"</p>

<p>"Months ago," replied the vampire, "some village idiot down the mountain."</p>

<p>"Looks like we found our sire," commented Buffy, "any other question love?"</p>

<p>"Just one," replied Willow, turning to address the demon, "now, do you know anything about the demons in these mountains?"</p>

<p>"Some."</p>

<p>"What," asked Buffy, the annoyance evident in her voice, reaching for his other arm.</p>

<p>"They are about a day or so north of here," added the vampire quickly.</p>

<p>"That does me fine," said the arch-mage, turning to Aiofe and Bridie, Willow asked, "ladies, can you think of anything else?"</p>

<p>Buffy, seeing answering head shakes from Bridie and Aiofe pulled Mr. Pointy from her jacket pocket and swiftly flung it at the vampire.  He was too startled to react as the stake entered his chest, resulting in a small pile of dust on the meadow floor.</p>

<p>"No miss this time," commented Willow, "nice throw lover."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Buffy, "now, lets get back to the fire, before we all freeze to death."</p>

<p>The four women returned to their fire and refreshed their mugs of cider before making preparations to head off to bed for the night.  Soon, all four women were dressed in multiple layers, and snuggled closely together, to stave off the cold, deep in their shared sleeping bag.</p>

<p>&lt;Red, you ok?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Yep, you?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Fine.  We really do care for them don't we?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;That we do.  Its like they've become an extension of us.  Its like the more you and I become one, the more we need them, almost as if we need them to express our individuality.  Maybe, I'm just babbling.  Maybe I'm way too tired to think strait.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;We are having one strange year, that's for sure,&gt; added Buffy just as the two of them drifted off to sleep.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Two days later Willow's group were still working their way through the river pass.  The going had been much harder than they had expected, with the weather worsening each day.  There was now nearly ten centimetres of fresh snow on the ground, and the overhanging steel grey skies were promising more over the next few hours.  They had to move slowly, due in no small part to the unstable footing on the slick, and partially frozen ground.  The good news, if there could be any, was that they had not seen any signs of the demons that were supposed to be in the area.</p>

<p>"If this gets any worse," said Aiofe, who was leading the band, "we are going to have to turn back."</p>

<p>"Can't risk being trapped up here," agreed Bridie, "we don't have enough supplies, or shelter."</p>

<p>"One more day," said Willow, who was bringing up the rear, "if we see no sign of them, we head back to the cottage and then the inn."</p>

<p>"Excellent idea lover," commented Buffy, who was still trying to get warm, despite several layers of clothing and a thick down coat.</p>

<p>One of the other reasons that they had been delayed was their stopping at a number of farmsteads, which dotted the river pass.  They had warned the people they had met about the demon threat, and had suggested to them that they pack up and head for the village, where they would be better protected, should any demons show up.</p>

<p>"I didn't thing that last family would leave," said Buffy, reflecting on the farmers they had talked to earlier in the day, "it was like he didn't believe us."</p>

<p>"Couldn't," offered Aiofe, "the idea is totally outside of these peoples experiences.  They just can't believe that they could be in danger."</p>

<p>"They'll learn," said Willow, "especially if I can't figure out a way of closing the hell-mouths."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bridie, trying to keep everyone focused on the task at hand, "that is a problem for when we return home.  At least these people were warned, and will take action.  There is one more farmhouse, just over this rise, which we can reach today.  Maybe after we pass along our news, they will let us stay indoors tonight, out of the snow."</p>

<p>"Now that is something to look forward to," agreed Willow, "just thing Buff, a night in a warm bed."</p>

<p>"Bliss.  Joy, and much happiness," replied the miserable slayer.</p>

<p>The prevailing wind, which had been coming up from behind them all day, suddenly changed so that they were walking into it.  The bitter wind began to bite into their faces, causing them to stop for a moment to wrap thick scarves around their heads, leaving only a small gap so they could see.  Buffy, with her enhanced senses, also noticed something else carried on the wind.</p>

<p>"More trouble ahead," she said, noticing the pungent stench of burnt buildings and flesh, "and we won't have a place to stay tonight."</p>

<p>"Demons," said Willow, "I guess we've found them."</p>

<p>"Yep," replied the slayer, training all of her senses ahead of them, trying to gain any additional information that she could.</p>

<p>"What do we do," asked Aiofe.</p>

<p>"We investigate," replied the arch-mage, "carefully."</p>

<p>Willow had the four of them continue to move in single file, however, instead of moving beside the stream, they moved over so that they were hugging the sides of the pass.  She moved Buffy to the lead, and had Aiofe bring up the rear. This way she knew that her best offensive weapon was in the optimum position to evaluate and to take action.  They moved slowly, with the stench of the burnt farm becoming stronger with each step.  Finally, they crested the hill, to look down on a scene that even Dante would have had difficulty to write about.</p>

<p>The farmstead had been a large operation, with several houses, barns and ancillary outbuildings.  Now it was all-ablaze, and there was a black, oily, smoke rising from the buildings.  The former occupants of the farm had all been rounded up, and forced into one of the sheep pens.  They had then been lead one by one to an area near one of the barns so that they could be systematically tortured and butchered.  There had been at least thirty such deaths so far; men, women and children had all received the same fate.  The young women noticed that there were four or five people still left alive, awaiting the same destiny as the others, locked in a sheep pen watched over by six demons.  The remaining force of forty or so demons was busily involved in what appeared to be the consumption of the former farmers.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be truly sick," said Aiofe, barely able to speak even in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Sick later," commented Buffy, with ice in her voice, "many demon deaths now."</p>

<p>"They're kinda overconfident aren't they," asked Willow, as she surveyed the area, noticing that the demons had not even bothered to have sentries posted.</p>

<p>"Dumb as posts," agreed the slayer, already thinking of the best way of approaching this particular problem.</p>

<p>"Suggestions," asked Willow, "whatever it is we want to work fast, before the slime can get to those other people locked up in that pen."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," offered Buffy.  She pointed out the group of demons who were consuming the former farmers and said, "that group over there, are they far enough from the remaining humans for you to use your magic?"</p>

<p>Willow thought for a moment and looked over the situation before replying, "yes, they're far enough away.  What do you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"Incinerate them.  That would be poetic justice, and will distract the others long enough for me to get down there.  Meanwhile, Aiofe and Bridie can follow behind me, and free the remaining prisoners, while you stay back and remain in reserve, just in case we need some major firepower."</p>

<p>"I like it," said Willow, "one thing though."</p>

<p>"Yes," asked the slayer.</p>

<p>"If you see a leader type," answered Willow, "save its ass.  I think we will want to bring it home, so that Grael and Amana can get some serious answers from it."</p>

<p>"Okey, dokey," said Buffy, as she and the other two young women moved slightly ahead of Willow.</p>

<p>Willow then began to concentrate on drawing up what energy she could before turning to her lover and saying, "ok loves, get running.  I will unleash my firestorm just as you reach the edge of the barnyard.  That should give you the distraction you need to get in close, before any of them can notice you and react."</p>

<p>Over the last few months, Willow had continued her magical training and had polished her skills to an ability that she would have never previously thought possible.  She was going to attempt to do something that months earlier would have been impossible for her, or if she believed Grael, for anyone.  She drew up the magical energy from around her, and instead of having to use it immediately, she stored it, waiting for Buffy and the others to reach the farm.  This would allow her to react the instant that Buffy entered the farmyard, and into danger. She watched as they approached the yard, and just as they entered it, she focused the energy she had collected and then yelled out, "lhome-loshtee jouyil."  As the energy left her, centred on the targets that she had selected, Willow collapsed, exhausted from her efforts.  As she sat on the cold ground, she thought to herself, "that should do the trick; but damn, that took more out of me than I thought it would."</p>

<p>The results were instantaneous, and explosive.  Each of the demons that Willow had targeted was immediately set ablaze, each of them turning into a pillar of flame.  The immolated demons began to run amok, screaming in agony, providing the distraction that Buffy needed so that she could close the distance to the demons that were guarding the remaining farmers.  As she crossed the farmyard, she briefly asked the Goddess for her help; as she did so, her sword began to pulsate on her chest, ready for action.  Buffy reached down, grasped the hilt of her sword and sighed softly as it detached from her body.  Raising the sword above her head, Buffy felt a surge, almost sexual, go through her body as it ignited.  Turning to Aiofe and Bridie she screamed, "lets kick some demon but."</p>

<p>The slayer then turned towards the pen, which was holding the farmers, and screamed, "die, demon scum," at the demons standing directly in front of the locked gate.  Running directly at the six demons, Buffy raised her sword overhead, and just as she came within reach of the first of the stunned into motionless demons, a three horned humanoid standing nearly two meters tall, she slashed violently downwards, slicing deep into its neck and torso, causing it to fall to the ground, body twitching as it died.</p>

<p>The remaining demons that had been guarding the humans bolted.  They had already been spooked by the simultaneous, spontaneous immolation of their companions. Now they were faced with a human waving a huge flaming sword, who apparently was looking for their blood.  Seeing that the remaining demons had fled, Buffy yelled over her shoulder, "Aiofe, Bridie, get these people out of here, and back to Willow."  She had known the instant that Willow had collapsed and wanted the others to get back as quick as they could, to provide protection to her soul mate.</p>

<p>"Will do," replied Aiofe, as she and Bridie headed over to where the farmers had been penned and began to work on the gate's lock.  Within minutes, they had the door open and had collected the remaining prisoners.  They immediately left the farm, heading back to the arch-mage.</p>

<p>Buffy looked around, there were two demons heading away from her, towards the river and therefore totally out of immediate concern, and three heading towards the area in front of the barns where the farmers had been tortured and killed. Buffy could see that where they were heading was another farmer, bound to a post, and a human like demon who had been busy torturing him.  Thinking to herself, "looks like they're running to the boss," she took up the chase.</p>

<p>Hugh had been spending his time, very unproductively he thought, trying to extract information from peasants who had none to give.  He had continued with the torture and executions primarily to keep his troops happy, and to satisfy his own desire to lash out at something, or someone, for all the inconvenience and trouble he had been through in the last five months.  He had almost completed his questioning of one of the last farmers when all hell broke loose. Hearing the screams of his troops, he turned away from his victim, to see over forty pillars of flame, pillars that used to be his troops.</p>

<p>"Gods above," he whispered aloud, "what is going on here?"  At that point he saw three more of his men, men who were supposed to be guarding the remaining prisoners, running towards him.</p>

<p>"Master," the one in the lead screamed, "we have been set upon by humans." "What are you yelling about," Hugh yelled at the trooper, just as he saw the object of their fear, "never mind, I see her," he continued as he watched the slayer walk purposefully towards them, her flaming sword carried at an easy rest beside her.</p>

<p>"Attack her you fools," he yelled at the three terrified demons, "get her before she can get here, and get at me."</p>

<p>The demons reluctantly followed their orders, they were bound and had no choice in the matter.  They cautiously moved towards the slayer, trying to surround her on three sides.  Buffy was far too experienced to be fooled by any manoeuvre that these demons would try.  Seeing the attempt to flank her, she suddenly leaped towards her right, and kicked her opponent to the ground.  She then slashed at the downed demon, decapitating him.  She then ran back, towards the demon who had been trying to flank her on the left, and slashed across her waist, disembowelling the startled demon, who had not even had a chance to react to the death of his companion.  The third demon, a green-blue scaled beast, took the opportunity to slash Buffy across her back, ripping through her armour and opening up a twenty-centimetre gash over her shoulder.  Buffy internalised the pain, starting her enhanced healing process, as she turned around saying, "you're going to die for that.  Real slow." She attacked, her sword weightless, and she used it to whittle away at the demon.  He was unable to block her attacks, or counterattack in any way, and soon was bleeding from numerous cuts.  With each successive cut, he became weaker, until he collapsed to the ground, barely able to breath.  Buffy leaned over the demon, spat on him and said, "that is better than you deserve for attacking innocents."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped for a moment to collect her breath.  Her attack on the three demons had taken less than five minutes, and it had been less than ten since Willow's spell, but Buffy was nearly spent.  The stress of the battle, coupled with the blood loss from the demon's attack was beginning to have its effect on the slayer.  Her healing ability had partially closed the wound in her back, and had slowed the bleeding, but the wound was still having a debilitating effect on her.  She needed to finish this, and soon, so that she could rest and regain some energy.</p>

<p>"One more," she thought to herself, "but this one we want alive."</p>

<p>Hugh had had enough, all of his troops were dead, the majority smoking blackened corpses; he backed away and then turned and ran.  He didn't get far.  Buffy had noticed his attempt to escape and yelled out, "greimmey jouyil," resulting in Hugh coming to a complete stop as if his feet were bound to the ground.</p>

<p>Buffy slowly walked over to the post where the farmer was bound and carefully untied him saying, "its ok, you're safe now."  She continued to reassure the</p>

<p>weeping man, holding him in her arms, until Willow, Aiofe, Bridie and the remaining farmers approached.</p>

<p>"Now what," asked Buffy, drained, but not surprised to see Willow and the others.</p>

<p>"Now we bandage that cut on your shoulder," replied her lover, who had immediately left for the battle the instant she had felt Buffy's injury, "and get moving back to the cottage." "What about statue boy over here," asked Aiofe, "what do we do with him?"</p>

<p>Willow walked over to the frozen leader and commented quietly, "I've seen this one before.  I can't remember where, but somewhere."  Turning to Aiofe and Bridie she said, "tie a rope to him and drag him behind us.  I don't really care if he gets a bit bruised.  Maybe if he is a bit battered it will be easier for Aiofe and Grael to get some information out of him."</p>

<p>Hugh paled at that information.  He knew that it was unlikely for the witch or the slayer to recognize him, however, once Grael saw him, his goose was truly cooked.  He began to think of ways to escape, maybe by sweet talking one of the farmers.  That hope was dashed when Willow turned to Bridie and said, "gag him. We don't know if he's a mage or not.  Beside we don't want him talking to anyone before we get back to the village."</p>

<p>Everyone then made immediate preparations to leave.  First they gathered what human remains they could, and after saying the appropriate prayers to the Goddess, placed them on a hastily built funeral pyre, and lit it; commending the bodies to the elements, while the souls went on to the next life, in anticipation of rebirth.</p>

<p>They then left the battlefield, knowing that the greater the distance they got from the farm, the less likely they would be followed.  However, Willow did one more thing before leaving.  Summoning up what little reserves she had, she reduced the demon corpses to their component dust, and watched with satisfaction as the dust scattered in the breeze.</p>

<p>Three days later Junulak and Talor, along with their force of fifty demons cautiously approached the burnt out farmstead.  The two demons that had escaped Willow and Buffy's attack had travelled non-stop to find the other leaders and apprise them of what had happened.   Junulak had immediately broken off the impending attack on the village he was surrounding and had set out on a forced march to where Hugh had been attacked.  Both of the leaders looked out over the still smoking runes.  They could see where Hugh had conducted his interrogations, and where the funeral pyre was.  However, they could find no signs of Hugh, his army, or their corpses.  It was if they had vanished into the mist.</p>

<p>"This bothers me," said Talor, "where are the bodies.  Where are the humans?"</p>

<p>"Gone," replied Junulak succinctly, "that witch must have done something with them."</p>

<p>"But what," asked the imp.</p>

<p>"Don't know.  But whatever it is, I have no desire to find out about it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That's it," replied Junulak, "I'm for the hills, our master be dammed.  I'm not going after that witch, and the slayer, with only fifty men.  Its obvious that they are too powerful, and that the slayer has built her support group.  He can try to dig me out of these mountains, or go after her himself, but I know what my fate will be if I bring back any news of failure."</p>

<p>All of the remaining demons shared the convictions of their leader, and they swiftly departed, breaking into small groups of two or three to find secluded homes deep in the mountains.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>That same morning Willow and the others made their way into the village. They had made excellent time back to the cottage, due to an improvement in the weather, and a desire to move as quickly as possible.  They had not wasted much time at the cottage.  They had packed up their possessions, including Willow's familiar, which had been left in the cottage.  Everyone had taken the opportunity for a bath and a hot meal before immediately heading back to the inn.</p>

<p>They made an immediate impression as they entered the common room of the inn. Although they were clean, they were haggard, the former farmers even more so, from the three days of forced travel.  They dropped their bags just inside the door as Willow called out, "hey all, we're back."</p>

<p>Grael, Amana and the others came out to greet their companions.  They stopped short as they watched Buffy pickup from the floor, and stand up a humanoid captive, who apparently was immobile as well as gagged.</p>

<p>Grael immediately recognized the prisoner.  Moving rapidly through the crowd, he stood in front of the demon and said, venom dripping from every word, "Hugh d'Troville, if that is even your real name.  How nice to see you again.  I just bet you would rather be anywhere but here."</p>
