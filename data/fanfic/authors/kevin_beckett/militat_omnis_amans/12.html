<p>Blackness.  He was in a realm of utter darkness, and completely
devoid and deprived of most forms of input to his senses.  The
demon Hugh d'Troville had been imprisoned, in an isolation cell.
The early winter wind added to the plunging temperatures outside,
but he felt no temperature change.  The fires and lanterns in the
inn were all lit to ward of the cold and the dark, but he saw no
light.  The inn was filled with the sounds of its inhabitants
getting ready to celebrate the impending birth of two children,
and the upcoming solstice, but he heard no sounds.  The various
members of Willow's strike force had settled into a steady and
dependable routine of activities, but he was totally incapable of
calculating the passage of time.  He was being subjected to this
deprivation in an attempt to make him totally dependant on one
other person, that person being the mage Grael.  The situation
was beginning to drive him to the breaking point, and he knew
that he wouldn't be able to hold out too much longer.  </p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Grael had explained his interrogation technique to Willow four
months earlier when she and Buffy had brought in Hugh as a
prisoner.  He had indicated that by depriving the demon of any
base of reference that he would soon become totally dependant on
the information given to him by others.  That would then result
in his trusting that person, and therefore providing to that
person anything, or any information, in order to avert being
returned to a situation of total seclusion.  To create this
situation the demon had been imprisoned in a cellar, deep
underneath the inn, and Grael had added extra shielding and
insulation around the room to create the total isolation cell.</p>

<p>Hugh was now nearly at the breaking point.  Grael had indicated
at the morning briefing that the demon was now almost totally
unaware of his surroundings, and that what internal resolve he
had left would almost certainly be gone in the next day or so.
He had begun to trust only Grael, and had become dependant on him
for all food and conversation.</p>

<p>"Finally," said Buffy, playing with her breakfast, "when you told
us about this technique, lo those many months ago, I never
thought it would take this long."</p>

<p>"Frankly," said Grael, "neither did I.  However, it looks like we
will soon be able to start asking some questions, and finally get
some answers."</p>

<p>"You'll keep us informed," said Willow, finishing her mug of
cider, using it to wash down Amana's collection of herbs that she
was taking as part of her pregnancy routine, "and, please make
sure that at least one of us is there."</p>

<p>Grael nodded his head, in understanding and acceptance.</p>

<p>"Why is this taking so long," asked Aiofe, "how has he been able
to hold out?"</p>

<p>"Some beings are just more resistant," answered Grael, "he's
strong, but nobody can hold out forever."</p>

<p>"Well," added Amana, "it's better than beating the information
out of him.  This way we're almost certain that everything he
tells us will be the truth."</p>

<p>"Not that I'd have minded beating him," said Buffy, "for what he
tried to do."  </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow had learned the true identity of their prisoner
when Grael had greeted him.  It had taken all of Willow's
strength and persuasive abilities to hold Buffy back from killing
Hugh, once she had realized that he was the one who was
responsible for the attack that nearly killed her lover.  Even
now, months later, Buffy was often incensed over the attack that
nearly killed her lover, and had to be restrained from going
downstairs and taking out her anger on the captured demon.</p>

<p>But that was mostly water under the bridge.  Buffy had more
important matters to worry about just then, the least of which
was Sonya and the other slayers and how to continue their
training in the depths of winter.  Buffy and Willow had been
notified of the remarkable performance of the new arrivals, and
of Frankel's theory, shortly after their return from their
honeymoon.  This had resulted in several busy days as the slayer
and the arch-mage struggled to make sense of this new
development, and to try to determine how thirteen new slayers
could help Willow in her quest to close the hell-mouths. </p>

<p>Over the last four months, the new slayers had made steady
progress until now their skill would rival an un-pregnant Buffy.
However, over the last week or so, they had not demonstrated any
significant progress in their abilities. It was becoming apparent
that they would have to find something for Sonya and the rest of
the new slayers to do, or they would begin to lose their newfound
skills and talents.</p>

<p>"Training alone isn't going to do it for much longer," said Buffy
as the morning briefing turned to other topics, "they are going
to have to get out and face demons, if only to prove to
themselves that they can do it."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Willow, "and we've been over this before.  Its
not as if we can put up a sign saying, 'yoo-hoo!  Demons! Come
here and be practice targets,' now is it?"</p>

<p>"No, but," replied Buffy, standing up from the table and
stretching out her back, trying to get some relief from the
pressure her soon to be bourn daughter was placing on it, "oh, I
don't know.  It's just that if I were in their shoes, I'd be
consumed with self-doubt.  I never had to worry about waiting for
vampires, my first watcher essentially threw me into the deep end
to see if I could swim."</p>

<p>"Fundamentally because you refused to believe a word he was
saying," said Willow, "if what you told me was correct, -and I
know it was now don't I,- you were a typical valley-girl, only
worried about your hair and other 'light' topics."</p>

<p>"Yah, but."</p>

<p>"Yah, but nothing," said Willow, smiling at the sometimes single-
mindedness of her spouse, "I think that as long as we get them
something to do in the next month or so, we'll be fine, don't
worry sweetie.  Meanwhile, they can continue to help Daithi with
the patrols, it's just that we will have them take the lead in
any encounters.  This will give them some confidence, knowing
that they will have experienced backup.  It's not as if these
women are totally ignorant of demons and the threat that they
place on humanity, now is it?</p>

<p>"Now what's next on the agenda?"</p>

<p>Over the previous months, Willow had developed into a true
leader.  She now had poise and self-confidence, and was
comfortable making decisions.  She met daily with her closest
advisors, what the rest of the inn's inhabitants and the
townspeople had taken to calling her command group: Buffy, Aiofe,
Bridie, Amana, Grael, Daithi and Frankel, to plan out the daily
minutia of caring and providing for the twenty-seven residents of
the inn.  Not to mention the additional work required in her
expanded role of providing employment and protection for the
other inhabitants of Morning Breeze.  She had, in fact if not in
name, replaced the town's mayor as the leader of the entire
community.</p>

<p>"Well boss," said Aiofe, "we have to go over the winter supply
situation for the inn and the town, and the improvements required
to the fortifications on the north side of town."</p>

<p>"Goddess," said the arch-mage, "this administrative stuff is
taking huge chunks of time.  How am I ever going to figure out
closing the portals, if all I'm doing is solving the next food
crisis."</p>

<p>"Not to mention that sometime in the next few days, you'll also
be busy feeding and caring for your baby," said Bridie, somewhat
unhelpfully.</p>

<p>"Don't remind us," said Buffy and Willow simultaneously, as their
babies began to do a three-step fandango.  </p>

<p>"Besides," said Willow, "I have been delegating my jobs, so that
once these parasites arrive, I will have less to do."</p>

<p>"They can't come too soon," said Buffy, continuing her pacing
behind the table.</p>

<p>"Well," said Amana, "it's often said that pregnancy is one month
too long.  And that that month always seems to be three times
longer than all the others, it's also true that at this stage
they are taking everything from your bodies that you can give."</p>

<p>"I'll agree with that; but the anticipation is beginning to drive
me nuts," said Willow as she got up from the table, she and Buffy
had been on constant pins and needles for the past week or so,
thinking that every little twinge was the start of labour,
"Amana, you and Grael handle the rest of the agenda, I've got
another appointment with the bathroom."</p>

<p>"I'm with you," added Buffy, also feeling the call from her
flattened bladder, "once this is over, I'm going to bronze the
seat.  It's seen more of me than you have recently."</p>

<p>"But it doesn't love you like I do," said Willow as she walked
out of the common room, hand in hand with her lover.  </p>

<p>Ever since the babies had dropped two weeks earlier and engaged
in their pelvic cradles, both women had beaten a constant path to
the bathroom; it seemed like every time they drank something,
they were sitting, peeing, ten minutes later.  </p>

<p>Once the two young women had left the room Grael turned to his
long-time friend and lover and asked, concern and worry evident
in his voice, "how are they doing?"</p>

<p>"They're fine," said Amana with a little laugh, "all first time
mothers go through this.  The babies are fine, they are fine,
they've done all the proper exercises and they've practiced as
best they can for the birth."</p>

<p>"Aiofe and I will be their coaches," said Bridie, "and we've been
dutifully practicing all of our breathing techniques."</p>

<p>"And Willow has done an excellent job of starting the delegation
of her duties," said Amana, "knowing that once the babies are
here she is going to have to re-prioritise her life."</p>

<p>"I'm just worried," said Grael, "our future depends on them."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, love," said Amana gently, "you were the same with
me for each of ours, and everything worked out now didn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but."</p>

<p>"In the words of our leader," said Amana, "yes, but nothing.
They will be fine.  They have enough on their minds without
having you hovering and worrying non-stop.  Now lets finish our
work here so that we can get the rest of the day underway.  After
all, we are hoping for a breakthrough with Hugh."</p>

<p>The six remaining members of the command group then turned their
attention to the rest of the daily briefing, before starting the
rest of their day.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>After completing their business in the bathroom, Buffy and Willow
had decided to sneak out, play hooky and have a relaxing bath.
It was just one of those days where they needed the soothing, and
buoyant, pleasure of a long soak.  It seemed like neither woman
could keep her mind focused on anything, and they both thought
that a bath would help.</p>

<p>The renovations to the bath complex had continued over the fall
and were now complete.  There were several rooms for changing and
relaxing after bathing, complete with fireplaces, and comfortable
furniture.  The three baths had all had their tile linings
repaired and the plumbing, which went from the deep wells and the
boiler, had all been refurbished so that there was now constantly
circulating water for all of the pools.  The fireplaces and brick
wall lanterns had all been cleaned and re-pointed, and the
windows and skylights had had their glass replaced.  The walls
had been freshly painted; mythical creatures now sported on new
frescos decorating those walls in addition to the ceilings.  The
complex was back to its original splendour, and as a result was
almost constantly occupied by either the inhabitants of the inn
or by people from the town.</p>

<p>Buffy noticed that she and Willow had lucked in, the baths, for
some reason, were deserted, allowing the two of them some much
needed, and missed, privacy.  As she slipped into the warm water
Buffy let out a soft sigh that dissolved days of tension away
from her, "this is exactly what I need."  Buffy then lay with her
head on the edge of the sunken bath, pillowed on a rolled up
towel, and her body floating out over the water.</p>

<p>"Is that all you need," asked Willow, as she stood, naked, over
her lover at the edge of the bath.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up to see her lover's muscular legs straddling her
head.  She continued her upward gaze to see Willow's legs join at
her dark and inviting cleft, before her body flared out at her
hips into the swell of her pregnancy.  Buffy noted the pale pink
lines, indicating Willow's stretch marks, running along side of
her belly, and the thick black line running from the patch of
light red hair before disappearing over the swollen abdomen.  In
the distance, Buffy could see the rounded swell of her spouse's
breasts, now ready to provide the needed nourishment to her soon
to be borne child, and Willow's face, framed in a mass of long
red hair.  Willow had taken her hair down, and had taken it out
of the braids that usually imprisoned it.</p>

<p>Buffy's breath caught in her throat as she whispered, "lovely.
You are a vision that I will never tire of."</p>

<p>"I just bet you say that to all the girls," said Willow.  She
looked down at her lover, her long blond hair escaping the casual
braid in which it had been placed that morning to float out over
the water and sparkling with reflected sunlight.  She saw the
swell of her breasts, which rounded to peaks of dark-brown,
tipped with thick red nipples.  She admired the swell of Buffy's
pregnancy, and sighed softly when she saw the proof of the
Goddess's favour in the tattoo of the flaming red sword, which
started between the slayer's breasts, continuing over her abdomen
with the point of the sword out of view, hidden by the pregnancy.</p>

<p>She moved beside Buffy before also slipping into the water,
exhaling softly as her body entered the warm water, "you were
right, love, this is exactly what we needed."</p>

<p>"Soon," said Buffy, "soon it will be over."</p>

<p>"Not over, just a new beginning."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're right, a massive new beginning."</p>

<p>The two young women then lay in silence, enjoying the soporific
effect of the warm water.  Before long, they were in a semi-sleep
state, relaxed and not worrying about anything at all.</p>

<p>-Lover,- said Buffy.</p>

<p>-Yes?-</p>

<p>-What do you really think it's going to be like?-</p>

<p>Willow slowly swung her legs down from where they had been
floating and sat on one of the benches that had been installed
along the inside of the bath.
"Don't know," she said after reflecting for a few moments, "its
not something that mom and I ever really talked about."</p>

<p>"All mom ever told me was that it was painful," said Buffy, as
she too sat up in the water, turning on the bench to face her
lover, "I'm scared."</p>

<p>"We'll have Amana, Bridie and Aiofe, not to mention our skills at
self healing," said Willow, "we'll be ok."</p>

<p>"But, we probably won't have each other," said Buffy, embracing
Willow in a bear hug.  Buffy was giving voice to the prevailing,
unsaid, belief that, given the way their pregnancies had gone so
far, they would go into labour at the same time, and most likely
deliver within seconds of each other.</p>

<p>"We will be together," said Willow, "I promise."  She then began
to lightly kiss her lover, starting at the curve of her neck and
working her way along Buffy's breastbone.  She then moved lower
and planted several soft kisses along the underside of each
breast before she moved upwards and gently sucked in an engorged
nipple, tickling it with her tongue.  </p>

<p>"I just love your new shape," said Willow pausing for a moment
from her suckling, "so much more to enjoy."</p>

<p>"Be gentle, they are very sore today."</p>

<p>"Don't I know it," said Willow, as she once again bent down to
blow softly on each of Buffy's erect nipples.</p>

<p>"That feels so nice," said the slayer, closing her eyes, "don't
stop, it has been so long."</p>

<p>For the last month or so Buffy and Willow had not been able to do
much to relieve each other's sexual needs.  They were unable to
find a position that was comfortable for both of them, due to the
pregnancy-induced changes in their bodies.  They had therefore
resorted to brief snatches of pleasure; they had also made due
with their various magical skills, but it wasn't the same as the
actual touch of their lover's fingers and tongue.  They hadn't
had a good night's sleep in weeks, and even falling asleep in
each other's arms was no longer possible.   This situation had
led to very frustrated, and horny, women.</p>

<p>Buffy moaned as the efforts of her lover began to have an effect
on her body.  She noticed that her breath was becoming shallow,
and that the fine hairs on her body were all erect, "damn," she
thought, "she's only paying attention to my breasts.  What's
going to happen if she moves her attention somewhere else?"</p>

<p>-You'll pop like a firecracker,- said Willow, smiling as she did
so, -that is my intention.-</p>

<p>-Please,- whimpered Buffy, as sweat began to bubble from her
skin, -please don't make me beg.-</p>

<p>-I'm not that cruel,- said Willow as she began to roll each of
Buffy's nipples with her fingers while she licked and kissed her
way down her lover's body, -at least not today, I'm not.-  Willow
proceed to flick Buffy's bellybutton, which had become an outie,
with her tongue before beginning to kiss the dark line on the
slayer's abdomen.   </p>

<p>"Float your legs again," said Willow, "that'll allow me to access
you properly."</p>

<p>As Buffy complied with her lover's request, Willow moved out
deeper into the pool, and then between Buffy's floating legs.
"That's better," said Willow, "now our bloated bellies won't be
in the way."</p>

<p>Willow reached underneath and raised Buffy's thighs and crotch up
out of the water, supporting them with her hands and with the
water; she then moved forward towards her goal, like a shark
moving towards a wounded fish.  She began to alternately kiss and
nibble each thigh, moving ever so slowly towards the centre of
her lover's pleasure.  Soon she was licking at Buffy's labia,
leaving long wet trails that she then blew dry, in order to
prolong the pleasure, and the anticipation.  Buffy was now
squirming, whimpering and trying to find release and Willow was
having a difficult time keeping the object of her desire above
the water.  Just as Buffy thought she would die from the
anticipation Willow licked, then sucked, on her clitoris.  Buffy
climaxed, then as Willow continued her ministrations, climaxed
again.  Willow released her hold on Buffy and allowed her to
relax, sitting once again at the edge of the bath.</p>

<p>"That was wonderful," said Buffy, embracing her lover in a hug,
"the perfect way to end a relaxing bath."  </p>

<p>Buffy kissed her spouse, and lightly nibbled on her lips.  Willow
responded by using her tongue to paint Buffy's teeth before
engaging in a tongue battle.  They continued in this manner,
making love to each other's mouth for several, long, moments
before breaking the kiss and moving slightly apart.</p>

<p>Buffy reached out and softly stroked Willow's long red hair
saying, "you know that I love you more than anything."</p>

<p>"Ditto.  Now it's your turn to give me release."</p>

<p>Buffy agreed, and by duplicating Willow's efforts in the pool,
stimulated her lover to a series of orgasms.  Just as Willow was
coming off her last climax she said, "Goddess, there you go
again, tripping my breakers."</p>

<p>"Only because I love you."</p>

<p>The idea of breakers chased around in Willow's mind for a while
as she thought, "damn, this means something, but I can't figure
it out."</p>

<p>-Oh, you will.  Give it time.-</p>

<p>-Snoop.-</p>

<p>-You still love me though.-</p>

<p>-Always.-</p>

<p>Sated for the moment, the two women then continued their lazy
lounging in the bath, trying to get their tired, sore, muscles to
relax.  Just as they were beginning to drift of to sleep their
solitude was interrupted by the arrival of Bridie and Aiofe.</p>

<p>"There you are," said Bridie, as she came into the bath carrying
several large towels.  Turning to look over her shoulder she
continued, "found them."</p>

<p>"Skipping out on us again were they," asked Aiofe also entering
the room.</p>

<p>"Just you wait," said Buffy, getting out of the bath before
turning to help Willow, "you'll find out for yourselves, oh in
about four months or so, what it's like."</p>

<p>Aiofe and Bridie were now about four and a half months along, and
were beginning to show signs of their own pregnancies. </p>

<p>"What is it," asked Willow, with a little bit of pique in her
voice as she began to dry off with one of the towels, "what major
emergency needs my attention now?  The cook spill a bowl of soup,
or is it something else?"</p>

<p>"Grael thinks that he has a breakthrough with the demon," said
Bridie, "Amana sent us to find you."</p>

<p>"Major cool," said Willow, all annoyance gone from her voice,
"let's go."  Willow began to pace rapidly out of the room heading
for the connecting passage.</p>

<p>"Oh love," said Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You might want to get dressed first."</p>

<p>"Oh!  Yes."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Later that morning Willow, along with Buffy and Amana, met Grael
at the entrance to the isolation cell.  It was not the door to
the room in which the demon Hugh had been imprisoned; rather it
was the door to a small antechamber just before the cell itself.
Grael had explained this set-up as a requirement to keep Hugh
from obtaining any clue about his surroundings.  The small annex
allowed Grael to approach Hugh, without giving any hints about
the time of day, and also to clandestinely observe the demon.
Grael never actual entered Hugh's cell, he simply conversed
through a portal in Hugh's cell door.</p>

<p>"I think it's time," said Grael as the three women came down the
stairs into the cellar, "he's very compliant and cooperative."</p>

<p>"Excellent," said Buffy, "what do we do now?"</p>

<p>"Well the four of us will go into the outer-room, it'll be a
tight fit but we should all manage, then I will begin to ask a
few questions."  Willow's command group had prepared a list of
questions, which Grael had memorized.  </p>

<p>"What if we need clarification on a question," asked Willow, "how
do we do that?"</p>

<p>"This is not going to be a quick process," said Grael, "it will
take a few days to get all of our answers.  So, if you think of
anything just let me know at the briefing and I'll add it to the
next session's question list." </p>

<p>The four humans then entered the annex and after they had shut
the outer door, Grael opened the small portal and called out,
"Hugh, I'm back."</p>

<p>"Where were you?"</p>

<p>"Just away for a few minutes.  Now, tell me who is your friend?"</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"And you'd do anything for your friend, now wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I want to."</p>

<p>"Good.  Now I have a couple of questions.  Would you like to
answer them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, if you do, I might be able to help you.  Would you like
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I would."</p>

<p>"Ok, lets begin," said Grael, who paused for a moment, took a
deep breath, and then continued, "now Hugh, you are a demon
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but you knew that."</p>

<p>"And you have been bound to a master?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dreaded lord."</p>

<p>"Where is your lord?"</p>

<p>"At his castle."</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"South, I do not know how far."</p>

<p>Grael had begun with a number of simple questions, designed to
make Hugh comfortable with the situation, and allow him to open
up to Grael.  After another series of these simple questions and
answers Grael was ready to proceed to a set of more pertinent
questions.  He said, "now Hugh, you've been very cooperative so
far.  I'm very happy and pleased with you."</p>

<p>"Thank you.  I want to help you."</p>

<p>"That's good.  Now what were you doing in the mountains?"</p>

<p>"Looking for the slayer."</p>

<p>"Why were you looking for the slayer?"</p>

<p>"To kill her."</p>

<p>"I understand that Hugh.  But why did you want to kill her?"

"My commander, and our master ordered it?"</p>

<p>"Who is your commander?"</p>

<p>"The demon Junulak."</p>

<p>"Where is this Junulak?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, he and Talor went one way to look for the slayer and
her companions, and I went the other."</p>

<p>"That's good Hugh.  I'm finished for now, but I'll be back soon.
Will you continue to help me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Hugh.  I'll talk to you soon.  Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night," said the demon.  Hugh was unaware that it was
nearly noon, and was going only on the clues that Grael was
deliberately planting.  When Grael returned later that day after
lunch, he would continue that pattern of deception by implying
that it was morning, even though only an hour or so had in
reality passed.</p>

<p>Grael closed the portal in the cell door before opening the door
to the annex.</p>

<p>"Excellent first session," said Amana, "it appears to be going
well."</p>

<p>"Nothing really new," said Willow.</p>

<p>"But he is cooperating," said Grael, "and he did confirm a few
things that we had suspected.  We will get more direct
information after lunch and over the next few days or so."</p>

<p>"He also gave the impression that they were primarily looking for
you, Buffy," said Amana.</p>

<p>"What comfort."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>At lunch neither Buffy nor Willow were particularly hungry.  They
simply picked at, and played with, their food since both of their
stomachs were very upset.  The talk at the table centred on the
breakthrough with Hugh, and suggestions were made on how to
continue the questioning; however, neither the slayer nor the
arch-mage contributed much to the conversation, preferring to
sit, starring into space.  This lack of attention by the two
young women on the proceedings at the table was not lost on
Amana.</p>

<p>"You two ok," she asked, "you haven't eaten a thing."</p>

<p>"Not that hungry," said Willow, petting and stroking Shadow-Cat
who had shown up demanding to have attention paid to her, "tummy
is a bit tender."</p>

<p>"Same here," added Buffy, "actually the sight of food is kind of
sickening."</p>

<p>"Grael," said Amana.</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"You are going to have to proceed alone this afternoon," said
Amana, getting up from the table and motioning for Bridie and
Aiofe to join her, "Buffy and Willow appear to be in early
labour, so I'm going to check on them.  If so, I'm going to be a
bit busy for the rest of the day."</p>

<p>As if that was a signal, suddenly both young women felt a
powerful contraction.  Earlier in their pregnancy they had felt
Braxton-Hicks contractions numerous times, but those were nothing
compared to the first experience of the real thing; both Buffy
and Willow stood from the table, holding their stomachs, and
said, "oh boy.  It's time."</p>

<p>"Meow," agreed Shadow-Cat, pleased that her human was about to
have her kitten.</p>

<p>"Just think," said Aiofe helpfully, as she was getting up from
the table, to move over to support Buffy, "they're going to get
worse."</p>

<p>"Joy!  Bliss!  Happiness!"  Said Buffy, as she and Aiofe began to
walk towards the baths, "just wait, you're going to have the same
thing to look forward to, and I'll be there to laugh."</p>

<p>Amana led Buffy and Willow, along with their birthing partners,
back to the baths.  Both women had decided, after much
consultation with Amana, to have water births.  The deciding
factor was when Amana had indicated that one of the advantages to
this birthing method was that it was less stressful on both the
mothers and the babies.  They had taken one of the extra rooms in
the bath complex and converted it into a relaxing birthing room;
complete with a number of comfortable chairs and a bed so that
Amana could examine the expectant mothers.  The warm bath, in
which Willow and Buffy had recently relaxed, had had an apparatus
built into it, to support Buffy and Willow, and so that all
members of the birthing team would have something to hold onto
while the babies were delivered.</p>

<p>As they entered the birthing room, both women experienced another
powerful contraction.  Once it had passed, Amana turned to Aiofe
and asked, "what do you think; five minutes or so, and about
forty seconds in duration?"</p>

<p>"Sounds about right, but what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"About another four or five hours, at a minimum."</p>

<p>"What," squealed both Buffy and Willow, "four more hours?"</p>

<p>"At least," said Amana, "now lets get you, one at a time, up on
the bed so I can see just how far along you are."</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow were helped by their coaches out of their
restrictive clothing and into soft, warm, linen shifts.  They
would have been cold, except for the fireplace billowing out
heat, and the in-floor pipes that carried hot water from the
boiler to the baths, which radiated heat into the room.  </p>

<p>Amana examined both women and when she was finished turned to
them and said, "ok, up on your feet and get walking.  The more
you walk, using gravity to help, the faster you will progress.
You are both at three centimetres and about twenty percent
effaced, so things are moving along nicely."   Amana then turned
to Aiofe and Bridie and continued with, "you two walk with them,
and support them when they have a contraction.  If they lose
their plugs, or if their water breaks, get them back here.  Now,
I'm going to go and arrange for food and drink to be delivered by
Lynda and the other cooks on a fairly regular basis."</p>

<p>"But," said Buffy, "where do we walk?"</p>

<p>"Here, in the corridors, in the inn.  It doesn't matter as long
as you stay warm, and keep walking.  I'll examine you again in
about an hour or so, and see how things are going."</p>

<p>The foursome began to make numerous circuits around the inn,
accompanied by Shadow-Cat who kept pace with their every step.
They were required to stop ever every four or five minutes to
endure another contraction; Buffy and Willow held each other
during the contractions, each trying to be strong for the other.
After an hour or so, they returned to the birthing room so that
Amana could examine them.  They were informed that they had
dilated to four centimetres and that they were progressing very
rapidly.  They were ordered back on their walking circuit since
it appeared to be helping the process along nicely.</p>

<p>The rest of the inn's inhabitants, with the exception of the
cooks and Grael, slowly started to stop their activities and
began to gather in the common room, to wait for news on Buffy and
Willow's progress.   They passed the time in the usual manner, by
eating, drinking and making bet on the time of birth and the size
of the babies, since all were aware that Willow and Buffy would
be having girls.</p>

<p>Six hours later, the repetitive walking tour of the inn was
interrupted by both Buffy and Willow's water breaking, along with
losing their mucus plugs.  They brought the cheerful news to
Amana, since it might mean a respite, or even an end to the
continuous walking.  They were all ecstatic to learn that the
expectant mothers were one hundred percent effaced and had
dilated to eight or so centimetres.  Amana informed them all that
it was time to get naked and into the water, to get ready for,
and to deliver, their babies.</p>

<p>"Finally," said Willow, with no small amount of exhaustion
evident in her voice, "it was getting hard to walk with the
contractions coming every three minutes."</p>

<p>"No kidding," agreed Buffy, "the end is in site... maybe."</p>

<p>Shortly the five women were in the pool, with a very concerned
Shadow-Cat watching from the edge of the bath and pacing back and
forth.  Buffy and Willow were side by side, supported by the
special bench which had been built into the pool for this
purpose.  Aiofe and Bridie began to actively coach the expectant
mothers through their contractions, encouraging them to breath
properly both through and with the contractions.  Both Buffy and
Willow began to use their bio-feedback skills to control the
pain, while maintaining control and awareness of their bodies and
what was happening.  The warm, nearly hot, water was having its
beneficial effect.  It had softened and had helped to relax all
of the tissues and muscles around the cervix and vaginal passage
of both young women, thereby nearly eliminating the chances of
tears.   After nearly forty minutes in the bath the contractions
were longer and much closer together, almost without respite,
both young women had fully entered transition.  Amana examined
both of them and said that they were nearly fully dilated.  </p>

<p>"Ok ladies," she said, "I know this is going to be hard, but
don't push until I tell you."</p>

<p>"How much longer," asked Willow, panting through another
contraction, "I have this overwhelming need to push."</p>

<p>"Two or three more contractions should do it."</p>

<p>-How are you doing sweetie,- asked Willow.</p>

<p>-About the same as you.-</p>

<p>-Over soon.-</p>

<p>-Let's hope,- said Buffy reaching over to grasp her lover's hand.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, after Amana had finished one more
examination, she looked up and said, "ok, this is how we are
doing it.  Both of your babies are crowning, so on the next
contraction I want the two of you to take a deep breath, hold it
and push evenly."</p>

<p>"Here comes the contraction," she said, "now remember, push
evenly.  Aiofe, get over here to help with Buffy's baby."</p>

<p>With concentrated effort, Buffy and Willow were able to push
evenly and they were rewarded with the news that both babies'
heads were now out.</p>

<p>"Now hold on for a moment and don't push," said Amana, "I know
that is going to be hard, but I've got to help with the
shoulders."  A few minutes later, she said, "ok, now push and
let's get these babies delivered."</p>

<p>With that, both Willow and Buffy gave one last push and delivered
their babies into the waiting hands of Aiofe and Amana.  Both
women passed up the newborns to lie on their mothers' chests
before they rubbed the babies backs to start their breathing.</p>

<p>Both girls let out hearty howls, as they took their first breaths
of life.  A hearty meow from a relieved familiar joined the
babies' cry.</p>

<p>-Happy,- asked Willow.</p>

<p>-Ecstatic.-</p>

<p>-So is Shadow-Cat,- said Willow, -I'm getting nothing but waves
of happy vibes from her.-</p>

<p>"Time," said Amana.</p>

<p>"Nine seventeen," replied Bridie.</p>

<p>Aiofe and Bridie then quickly grabbed warm towels and wrapped the
babies, as Amana tied and cut the umbilical cords.  </p>

<p>Both Willow and Buffy looked down at the life that they had
produced.  They saw perfect, beautiful babies.  From the full
head of flaming red hair, to the tips of their little pink toes,
both girls were flawlessly formed.  The babies, after their
initial howls of protest over the indignity of being born, had
settled in and were staring up at their mothers.</p>

<p>"Hello Kendra," said Willow softly, staring into her daughters
deep blue eyes, while she lightly stroked her daughter's damp
hair, "welcome to the world."</p>

<p>"Hello Faith," said Buffy, running her fingers along her
daughter's arm, and having her finger grabbed in a tiny fist,
"I'm your mommy."</p>

<p>After a few minutes, both babies were taken by Aiofe and Bridie
to be cleaned up and wrapped in thick blankets, before being
placed into a basinet.  While that was going on Willow and Buffy
were helped out of the pool by Amana, to sit on the side of it on
thick towels, in order to deliver their placentas.  </p>

<p>Once that final task of the birthing process was completed, Buffy
and Willow were carefully bathed and redressed in thick warm
clothing, before being led back to the common room of the inn, on
the way to their own room to get some much needed rest.  As they
entered the inn they received the hearty congratulations of
everyone in the room.  They took a few moments to present their
daughters to the assembled members of Willow's strike force, and
the townspeople who happened to be in the inn.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Later that evening, after she had settled the new mothers and
their newborns, Amana made her way done to the kitchen, to
scrounge herself a late supper.  She wasn't all that surprised to
see Grael sitting in the common room, with a mug of warm cider
waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Well they're healthy," she said as she sat down across from
Grael, "and they are sleeping, all four of them."</p>

<p>"What about Aiofe and Bridie?"</p>

<p>"They've pulled a cot into the room so that they won't disturb
Buffy and Willow.  They are asleep also.  Along with one very
self satisfied cat."</p>

<p>"Any problems."</p>

<p>"None at all, worry wart.  It was a flawless delivery, both
babies are healthy, and a good size, nearly four kilos."</p>

<p>"That's good news," said Grael, getting up from the table and
heading over to the bar in order to refill their mugs, "now
what?"</p>

<p>"Now I eat, and grab a nap before heading back up in a couple of
hours.  The babies will be awake, and hungry."</p>

<p>"It's going to be a busy few days," said Grael, sitting back down
at the table and passing over Amana's mug.</p>

<p>"You're not kidding.  By the way, how did the afternoon session
with Hugh go?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good actually.  He started to open up a little bit."</p>

<p>"But," asked Amana.</p>

<p>"I'm just thinking.  What do we do once we have what we need?"</p>

<p>"We escort him, blindfolded, to the southern pass and release
him."</p>

<p>"Is that just?  I mean, he is a demon, he was spying on us, and
he did arrange for the attack on Buffy and Willow."</p>

<p>Amana got up from the table and began to pace before one of the
fireplaces.  She stared into the fire and said, "we can't just
kill him.  I'd have cheerfully slit his throat back in the
Capital, or if we were in combat, but if we just cold-bloodily
kill him now we are no better than he is."</p>

<p>"Might be difficult," said Grael, "Buffy is still out for blood."</p>

<p>"We will make her see reason.  Now I'm for a quick nap, care to
join me?"</p>

<p>The two senior mages turned down the lamps in the common room and
made their way up the stairs to their room.  Fortunately it was
not that far from Buffy and Willow's room, so that Amana would be
able to reach the new mothers quickly if the need arose.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Early the next morning, five or more hours before dawn, both new
mothers were awakened by the pleas of hunger from their
daughters.  Rubbing the sleep from their eyes, Buffy and Willow
slowly got out of bed, before turning back to pick up their
babies, who had been sleeping between them.</p>

<p>"There, there, love," said Willow, "everything is ok."</p>

<p>"It's ok Faith," said Buffy, "mommy is here.  What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"They are hungry, and need to be changed," said Amana as she
entered the room, with fresh linen, "now lets get them changed
and then on the breast."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, there were two clean babies, one of whom
was contentedly feeding while the other was still fussing and
crying.</p>

<p>"I'm a total doofus," said Willow, "why can't I get her to take
the breast?"</p>

<p>"You will," reassured Amana, "it just sometimes takes a little
time, that's all."</p>

<p>"Then why was wonder mother over there able to figure it out so
soon," said Willow, petulance, and exhaustion, in her voice,
"I'll never get this to work."</p>

<p>-Relax love,- said Buffy, -you are so tense, is it any wonder you
are having problems.-</p>

<p>-I know.  But it's so frustrating.  This is something that is
totally natural, so why can't I do it?-</p>

<p>-With Amana's help, you will work it out.  But meantime, I have a
suggestion.-</p>

<p>-Yes?-

-Let me feed Kendra, at least a little bit.  She will calm down
with some food, and then you can relax and try again.-</p>

<p>Willow thought the idea over for a few moments, with Buffy fully
aware of her internal debate.  Finally, common sense, and her
desire to do what was best for her baby won out and she agreed,
-ok.  It makes sense.-</p>

<p>Willow then turned to Amana, who with the lack of sleep was
beginning to nod off, and said, "Amana, Buffy asked, and I
agreed, to feed Kendra."</p>

<p>Amana thanked the Goddess.  If Willow's inability to breastfeed
had gone on much longer, she would have been forced to suggest
this action.  Amana had resisted to that point, fearing Willow's
reaction.  "That is an excellent suggestion," she said, "and I
have another."</p>

<p>"Anything," said Willow, "I'll try anything."</p>

<p>"While Buffy feeds Kendra, and you hold Faith, I'm going to run
downstairs and grab you a glass of brandy.  The alcohol will help
relax you."</p>

<p>An hour later things had settled down.  Willow was sitting in a
large armchair before the fire, having finally been able to get
Kendra to latch on, no longer feeling like a failure, happily
watching her daughter eat.  Buffy and Faith had fallen back
asleep and Amana was nodding off in another chair beside Willow.
Meanwhile Aiofe and Bridie arranged an early breakfast for
everyone on one of the dressers.</p>

<p>"There, that should keep until later, when we get up," said Aiofe
as she covered up a dish of sliced fruit.</p>

<p>"Aiofe love," said Willow, "would you be a dear and bring me
something.  I have a bottomless pit for a stomach."</p>

<p>"How are you doing," asked Aiofe, bringing over a plate of fruit
and cheese.</p>

<p>"Wonderful.  I've never been happier."</p>

<p>"What do you mean," asked Bridie, as she curled up at the foot of
Willow's chair, leaning back on the arch-mage's legs.</p>

<p>"It's just now that I feel my life is complete.  With Buffy and
now with our children, everything seems to be finally falling
into place."  That statement led Willow to once again think,
"that means something, somehow it's important, but I just don't
know how or what yet."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll find out soon enough I guess," said Bridie, "the
wait is tough though."</p>

<p>Faith finished feeding, detached from the breast and looked up at
her mother with a little 'plop' as the suction broke.  Willow
stared down, and said softly, "Hi.  I'm your mommy, and I am
going to always be here for you.  I'll keep you from harm, safe
from the monsters under the bed and the demons in the dark."
Willow was speaking not only of the metaphorical monsters of
childhood, but also of the monsters she knew were real.  Her
daughter rewarded her mother's devotion with a burp, and a small
amount of drool.</p>

<p>"How cute," said Aiofe, stifling a giggle.</p>

<p>"Talk about no respect," said Willow, cleaning her daughter
before placing her over her shoulder for a proper burp, "here I
am, professing my unending commitment, and all I get is drool for
my efforts."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bridie, getting up from the floor, "Kendra has
continued her respect for her mother by falling asleep, so I
think that it is time for the two of you to get back to bed."</p>

<p>"But, it's nearly morning," said Willow, smothering a yawn, "I've
got to get the day going."</p>

<p>"No you don't love," replied Aiofe, relieving Willow of her
daughter, "what you have to do is get some sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes boss," said Willow climbing into bed.  "Are you going to
tuck me in too?"</p>

<p>"Only if you promise to be good," said Aiofe, placing Kendra
between her parents.</p>

<p>"I promise," answered the arch-mage as she drifted off to sleep,
joining her lover and their children.</p>

<p>"That's that," said Bridie, "now why don't you and I see about
getting ourselves cleaned up, and fed?"</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The next few days followed a predictable pattern.  Buffy and
Willow were allowed, almost ordered, to keep their activities to
a minimum, spending their time learning to care for their
daughters, resting and bathing.  Aiofe and Bridie spent their
time helping the new mothers, and keeping them from trying to do
too much, too soon.  Within the week, both Buffy and Willow had
managed to regain most of their energy, and their daughters were
sleeping for nearly four hours between feedings.</p>

<p>Willow was still having occasional problems with getting Kendra
to take the breast, therefore Buffy continued to provide her
assistance.  However, by the end of the week, both Willow and her
daughter had become sufficiently adept at the feeding ritual that
they were having very few problems.</p>

<p>"I think that I'm finally beginning to catch up on my sleep,"
said Buffy stretching her arms above her head as she sat up in
bed.</p>

<p>"You never needed much sleep," commented Willow, as she burrowed
deeper under the comforters snuggling up to two warm bundles, "I,
on the other hand, need my sleep."</p>

<p>"No you don't sleepyhead.  It's time to get up and face the
living.  Time to get back to work."</p>

<p>"Don't want to."</p>

<p>"Yes you do," said Buffy, as she began the process of stripping
the bed, having first transferred her daughters to their crib,
"besides, both Amana and Grael said that they would fill us in on
Grael's interrogation of Hugh."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Willow, reluctantly getting out of bed, "how
about I race you to the baths?"</p>

<p>Both women headed for the baths, passing Aiofe on the way.
Willow turned to the other woman and said, "Aiofe, my lover and I
are off to the baths.  Could you keep an eye on our two sleeping
beauties until we get back?"</p>

<p>"No problemo."</p>

<p>An hour or so later, Buffy and Willow, along with their daughters
who were asleep in carry slings, were back downstairs having
breakfast, for the first time in a week, in the inn's common
room.  They spent a good portion of their time catching up on
things, while showing off their children like the proud parents
they were.  Everyone, once they had had a chance to meet with the
new mothers, and to provide their congratulations, gradually left
the room, heading off to get their various activities for the day
underway.</p>

<p>As if it had been planned, Amana and Grael ended up at the table
just as the last of the well-wishers left.
"Hi Grael," said Buffy, "what's up?"</p>

<p>"This and that," replied the mage as he took a seat at the table,
"you two are looking better today."  Grael had, as a matter of
courtesy, been by to see both young women and their children
several times since the birth.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Willow, "we are.  Now Amana said that you have
finished with Hugh."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"And," asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Where to begin," said Grael.</p>

<p>"Well, as my mother is fond of saying," said Willow, "at the
beginning, and finish at the end."</p>

<p>"Okay then," said Grael, "I've continued my discussions with Hugh
over the last week and I think that I've been able to wring him
dry.  I was able to learn a few things of interest, particularly
on slayers and on the transport between worlds."</p>

<p>"Such as," asked Willow, her interest immediately peaked.</p>

<p>Grael then began to debrief Willow and Buffy.  He indicated that
once he had begun to talk Hugh had been very informative and
forthcoming.  He had indicated that he was over two hundred years
old, and had originated on a world far removed from this one.  He
had been summoned to this world, ten years ago, once the demon
leadership here had put the final touches on their plan for world
domination.  He had gone on to reveal that while to outsiders
demons appeared unorganised and antagonistic towards each other,
in reality they were all part of a network of clans who worked
together at a high level to subjugate new worlds.  When asked why
this was so, Hugh had indicated that the original worlds from
which the various demons originated were desolated shells, devoid
of all forms of energy, yet still home to millions of
inhabitants.  They used the hell-mouths as portals from one world
to the next, and as a means of draining the energy from a target
world, to support the demon's home worlds.</p>

<p>Willow had sat pensively during the debrief, mulling over what
Grael was sayings, and trying to draw conclusions in her mind
between everything.  She was attempting to make correlations
between what she had already discovered, or deduced, and this new
information.  After a few minutes she turned to Buffy and asked,
"thoughts love?"</p>

<p>"Only one; and that is why they were so determined to find me."</p>

<p>"Grael," asked Willow.</p>

<p>The mage then continued recounting the information that had been
given to him by the demon.  He said that Hugh was not that
knowledgeable about slayers, and why precisely they had been
hunting for her, but that the demon leaders had given specific
instructions to find the slayer, and kill her.  He was also aware
that the demons considered slayers to be the primary threat to
their existence, and that they took steps to eradicate them as
soon as they could on any new world, even though that could take
several generations and thousands of lives to accomplish.  He
also knew that they started the process of slayer removal on a
world centuries before the leadership had plans to attack it.</p>

<p>"That means whatever they are doing, they are doing already back
home," said Buffy.</p>

<p>"If only we knew what it was they did," said Willow, "once we
return we could figure out a way to stop it."</p>

<p>"That will be a problem for later," said Buffy, turning back to
Grael, "did the scumbag have anything else to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of any real substance."</p>

<p>"Good," said Buffy getting up from the table, "demon disposal
time."</p>

<p>"That won't be possible," said Amana softy.</p>

<p>"What do you mean," asked Willow.</p>

<p>"We let him go," replied Grael, "we blindfolded him, and two days
ago Sonya and Daithi led him through the southern passes."</p>

<p>"Why," said Buffy the anger dripping from her voice, and her body
tensing with suppressed rage, "after all that he was responsible
for."</p>

<p>"To do otherwise," said Amana, "would be to bring us down to his
level.  This way, he's on his own, without resources, to cope as
best he can."</p>

<p>Neither Buffy or Willow were fully convinced by the older mages
arguments, however, they didn't want to push the issue just then.</p>

<p>"However," said Amana, breaking into the tension that had arisen
between herself and Buffy, "on a brighter note, we do have one
thing to plan."</p>

<p>"And that would be," said Buffy, standing up from the table and
beginning to pace in front of the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Your daughters' naming."</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy had in fact thought this one over and had
already come to a conclusion on this matter.  Willow said, "we've
thought this over, and we'll do it at the solstice in two weeks."</p>

<p>"Excellent idea," said Grael, "have you finished working out the
details, since I'm assuming you will lead?"</p>

<p>"Nearly.  Just a few things left to work out."</p>

<p>The next two weeks flew by for the new mothers.  It was as if the
hours in a day evaporated before their eyes.  Some days they had
so much to do with their daughters, it was all they could do to
make time to have a bath, let alone get anything else
accomplished.  Buffy was still not happy with Amana and Grael's
decision to let the demon Hugh go free, her body language
screamed its rage every time she talked about it to the senior
mages.  However, she realized that there was nothing she could do
about it, and resolved to live with the situation, since she was
far to wrapped up in helping to care for a couple of very
demanding little girls.</p>

<p>At one point Buffy turned to her spouse and said, "how do single
moms do it?  I mean we have each other, Aiofe, Bridie and Amana
and there still isn't enough hours in the day."</p>

<p>"I know," said Willow, "Amana keeps saying that it's going to get
better, once the two of them start to sleep longer; but right now
I'm having difficulty believing her."</p>

<p>Soon it was solstice day, the day with the shortest amount of
light, the time to celebrate light, and the steady return of
longer hours of sunshine until the earth brought forth her bounty
in the spring.  In keeping with the day it dawned bright, wind
free, cloudless and bitterly cold.  </p>

<p>It would be a long day, and even longer night, for the solstice
ritual would last from sunset to sunrise.  It would be followed
by twelve days of gift giving and celebrations as the community
once again welcomed the birth of the infant sun, the eventual
triumph of spring over summer and as an excuse to have fun in the
bleakest time of the year.  </p>

<p>Willow and the others all took it easy during the day, with
everyone getting at least a few hours of sleep in the afternoon.
With a half hour to go before sunset, everyone in the village
assembled in the common room of the inn.  </p>

<p>Willow waited until they had all settled before beginning the
evenings work with the traditional, "Blessed be."</p>

<p>After she had obtained everyone's attention she continued, "This
is the Yule.  This is the longest night of the year, the night
before the sun's rebirth.  This is the night in which we face the
darkness, and rejoice in its defeat.  The night which begins the
our celebration of life, and the anticipation of the earth's
rebirth in the spring."</p>

<p>Willow went on to explain the ritual for the night, and how she
and the others in the circle would be sitting vigil for the sun
all night.  She said that everyone who wished was welcome to
stay, but she understood if they nodded off at some point.  She
explained that the altar was bare, except for the unlit Yule log,
a bowl of spring water and a vial of oil, and that the watchtower
candles would remain dark.  She indicated that the guardians
would not be called until the rebirth of the sun at dawn.  She
finished her discourse by saying that as soon as the prayers for
the new sun were finished that they would be having the naming
ceremony for Kendra and Faith.</p>

<p>By this time it was nearly time, so everyone in the circle took
their places, waiting for Willow, Buffy and Grael to begin.
Buffy was acting as Willow's ritual partner, while Grael would be
taking the role of High Priest.  Aiofe and Bridie were tasked
with holding the babies until they could be returned to their
mothers for the vigil.</p>

<p>The circle, complete with its chalk runes, had already been drawn
on the floor, and all of the other elements for the ritual were
in place.  Willow stood with Buffy and Grael and just as the sun
dipped under the western horizon began the night's work with,
"Blessed be."</p>

<p>Everyone replied, "blessed be."</p>

<p>Willow then continued with, "we are gathered in this time and
this place to celebrate the continued dance of the celestial
clock.  It is the longest night, let us stand vigil, face our
fears, and prey for the rebirth of the sun."</p>

<p>Willow then began the ritual breathing chants, to centre the
circle and to prepare everyone for the raising of energy.  Once
everyone had settled, Willow and Grael cast the circle and then
began to pour the risen energy into it.</p>

<p>They then cast the opening prayers, inviting the God and Goddess
into their work, and asking for their blessing and assistance for
the work ahead.  Once they had completed the opening. Willow then
led the invocation for the death of the old sun, which began the
vigil.  Members of the circle then sat down, to prepare
themselves for the long night ahead.  They prayed, and examined
their own soul to find balance in their life.</p>

<p>While this was happening, throughout the inn and the village, the
lamps were extinguished, and the fires banked.</p>

<p>Buffy sat quietly on a cushion late in the night, well after
midnight but with hours yet to go before the dawn, gently rocking
her daughter back to sleep after having fed and changed her.  She
was thinking about life and the changes that had happened over
the last ten months.  She thought about the burdens that she had
been placed under, and the joy in the fulfilment of her life with
Willow, their daughters and with Aiofe and Bridie.  She slowly
came to the realization that Amana and Grael had been right to
release Hugh.  That if she had sunk to his level and killed him
that she would have been discarding every oath that she had taken
on behalf of the Goddess.  With that realization, Buffy achieved
an inner peace, which was reflected in the total relaxation of
her body.  Everyone in the circle had been aware of Buffy's
torment over the Hugh situation, and everyone noticed when she
relaxed, indicating that the slayer had found an internal
solution.</p>

<p>Finally, Willow indicated that they should all stand, to finish
the ritual and welcome the birth of the sun.  After allowing
everyone a few minutes to stretch out the kinks in their muscles,
she began the closing of the ritual with, "Blessed be, it is
time."</p>

<p>She then continued with the invocation to the new sun, as she
said, "Queen of the sun.</p>

<p>"Queen of the moon.</p>

<p>"Queen of the horns.</p>

<p>"Queen of fire.</p>

<p>"Bring to us your child, the child of light, the child of
promise.</p>

<p>"You are the great Mother</p>

<p>"You give life to him.</p>

<p>"He is the Lord, the Lord of Light.</p>

<p>"He has died, and is born again this day.</p>

<p>"Darkness, fear, tears and anguish are set aside, once your son
is born again.</p>

<p>"Golden Sun.</p>

<p>"You light the hills, and the fields.  You light the earth and
the water.</p>

<p>"You light the sky and are the source of all fire."</p>

<p>As Willow finished the prayer, Grael went to stand before the
altar, he then said a quiet prayer before lighting the Yule log,
which had been resting on it.  Then he took a taper, used the
fire from the recently lit log, and went around the circle, to
light the watchtower candles.  </p>

<p>Once that task had been completed, Willow invoked the guardians
and asked for their assistance for the naming of the two new
children in their community.</p>

<p>Grael moved to the edge of the circle, since the remainder of the
work would be conducted by Buffy and Willow.   Aiofe and Bridie
came to the centre and held the babies while Buffy and Willow
performed the naming ritual.</p>

<p>Willow centred herself, and gathered back the energy in the
circle and said, "Goddess, in all of your majesty and wonder, we
ask that you cast your blessing on our children, and become a
friend to them."</p>

<p>Buffy then continued, "Guardian of the East.  Giver of air, and
herald of spring, I ask that you cast your blessing on our
children and become a friend to them."</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy continued to ask the guardians to bless their
children and then Willow finished the invocation of blessings by
saying, "Goddess, until they are old enough to chose their own
path, we ask that you watch over them and keep them safe from
harm."</p>

<p>Willow indicated to Aiofe and Bridie to unwrap the babies, so
that they could begin the anointing of the children. Buffy and
Willow then took the spring water and oil from the altar, stood
before their children, and said, "Water on your brows, for your
spirit.</p>

<p>"Oil on your lips, for your voices.</p>

<p>"Water on your necks, to keep your words truthful.</p>

<p>"Oil on your chests, to keep you healthy.</p>

<p>"Water on stomachs, to keep your appetite.</p>

<p>"Oil on you sex, to keep your vigour, and for your children to
come.</p>

<p>"Water on your thighs, to keep you strong.</p>

<p>"Oil on your knees, to keep you sturdy.</p>

<p>"And, water on your feet, to guide you on your journeys."</p>

<p>Aiofe and Bridie then re-wrapped the girls in thick linen
blankets.</p>

<p>Finally, the two new parents performed the five-fold kiss, and
said, "Blessed be your eyes, so that you may see clearly.</p>

<p>"Blessed be your ears, so that they may hear the truth of the
Goddess's will.</p>

<p>"Blessed be your lips, so that you may speak the truth.</p>

<p>"Blessed be your hands, so that you may help others.</p>

<p>"And, blessed be your feet, so that you may walk in the path of
the Goddess, for all of your days."</p>

<p>Everyone in the room then said, "Blessed be, these children.  We
bring them into our hearts and into our community."</p>

<p>Willow dismissed the Guardians, and the circle.  Once this had
been accomplished, the Yule fire was brought to a secure place
where it would burn continuously for the next twelve days.
Members of the community lit their lanterns from this fire, to
take home with them so that they could light the lamps and fires
in their homes.</p>

<p>Willow walked slowly towards the stairs leading up their room, as
she did so she sighed, turned to her spouse and said, "Goddess, I
am tired.  I don't think I have an erg of energy left in me."</p>

<p>Buffy embraced her lover, and said, "I'm with you on that.  Let's
grab some food, and recharge our batteries before bed.  Once I
hit the pillow I think that I'm going to switch off like a
light."</p>

<p>"Energy.  Switches.  Batteries.  Recharging.  Falling into place.
Breakers," exclaimed Willow, "I've finally figured out all those
bits and pieces that have been running around in the excuse I
have for a mind."</p>

<p>"Yes," asked her slightly confused and exhausted spouse, "just
what is it you have figured out?"</p>

<p>"A way to close those cursed portals... forever."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Far away to the south, a demon master was facing a problem that
he had thought had been solved months earlier.  Facing him,
abased on the ground, was the demon Hugh, trembling in fear.</p>

<p>"So Hugh," said the demon lord, "I'm to believe that you were
captured by the slayer and her partner the witch, and imprisoned
for the last five months?"</p>

<p>"Yes master."</p>

<p>"And that they just let you go, without you having told them
anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes master," replied the demon, sweat running down his body,
even though the temperature was barely above freezing.</p>

<p>"And that you have no idea where Junulak or Talor are.  Or for
that matter the rest of the army you were entrusted with?"</p>

<p>"Yes master."</p>

<p>"Why isn't it that I believe you?"  Turning to four of his guards
he said, "take him away and let's see if pain will release the
truth from his tongue.  Make sure you dispose of the body once
you are sure you have all the answers I require."  </p>

<p>Hugh was hauled roughly to his feet and dragged out of the room,
watched impassively by the demon lord who was trying as hard as
he could to keep the fear in his bowels from showing to his
subordinates.  He knew that unless he was able to resolve this
problem quickly that he would soon be sharing the same fate as
his former lieutenant.</p>
