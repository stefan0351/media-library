<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 4 -->

<p>Willow continued to fidget and muss with her suit jacket. Next
to her in the elevator Xander Harris was standing ramrod straight and
looking directly ahead. With out turning he spoke to her. "Something
wrong mam?" The meaning of his words was clear and she stood still.
Because while they had been costumed by the aspiring actress Cordelia
they were now in the offices of Wolfram and Heart and had to stay in
character. In her case that was a technician for a non-existent
computer company that had a business plan on record, but no offices.
Xander had the more difficult role because he was posing as an actual
Wolfram and Heart security guard which meant if they were questioned
the questions would be directed at him. All the same she reviewed
their story. That she had been called in to repair the computer
system.</p>

<p>Of course there was always something wrong with the computer
system so the figured that no one would question a consultant being
called. Of course they had no real paper work to back up their story
so if worse came to worse they would end up relying on the 9mm pistol
Xander had strapped to his hip. As he pushed a floor number at random
she was praying to every deity she could think of to keep them
concealed. Of course they would try to find a nice out of the way
terminal since any office this size would be connected in a network.
Once there she had three objectives, first to get all the information
they could on the bock of obsidian in the basement. Second she would
try to get all the information possible on their security measures,
and finally she would try to put her own password into the system so
that she could an easier time hacking them again if she had to.</p>

<p>The reason Xander was there was just to make sure she was able
to do it and live to tell the tale. Angel, Wesley and Cordelia had all
seemed skeptical about their decision until they saw Xander break into
his luggage and break out an assortment of military hardware any SWAT
officer would be proud to call their own. The doors finally opened and
they stepped out to see the floor's receptionist, and it was with a
shock Willow realized they were on a high traffic floor. What startled
her even further was the way Xander nonchalantly walked right up to
her. "I'm escorting the computer consultant and we need an empty
office." The receptionist first looked at Xander, and then at Willow
and the hacked tried to give her a smile. "Where is her visitor id?"
Xander's face had been rather cool, but he allowed his expression to
look a little embarrassed. "Being printed, security took 45 minutes
just to confirm my id since I am a new hire." The receptionist nodded
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Ever since that Angel guy managed to break in things have
went from paranoid to insane." Xander's eyes seemed to get harsh and
he threw a meaningful look at her and then at Willow and the
receptionist clamed up. "Right, Lindsey is on some big project so you
can use his office." Xander flashed her a smile. "Thanks, we'll be out
of there in no time." Willow wanted to run into the doorway that the
receptionist pointed out, but she let her pace be dictated by Xander.
All the while she was inwardly amazed at his composure because they
both knew if they were caught being arrested was the least of their
concerns, but he had what she called his "soldier face" on. She had
first seen it when they had become their costumes on Halloween, and it
had shown up every other time Xander was required to use the military
skills imparted to him by Ethan Rane's spell. While most of the time
it kinda creeped her out it was comforting in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>With out either of them speaking a word Xander motioned her to
Lindsey's desk and she slid into his chair. Of course they both had
been told who he was before they had ever set foot into Wolfram and
Heart, and Willow was already taking advantage. She hooked her own
laptop into Lindsey's terminal so she would have something to work on
while she cracked his password. While she worked she was already
starting to sweat, W&H had top-notch computer security, and while she
might have greater system access with Lindsey's computer she had to
get into it first. Which she was able to do, but it left her worried
enough that she first focused on the security and shut down the
security cameras. Wolfram and Heart may be irredeemably evil, but she
knew they were also lawyers and would have the law after them in no
time if they had enough evidence. When she saw the camera lights
flicker and go out she smiled and her typing increased. </p>

<p>Multi-tasking she knew the computer recognized a system
failure and used it to gather information on the security system.
Telling the machine to check over its system she backed up a copy of
its actions to her computer, making Wolfram and Heart's security
detail it's own defenses to her. While their computer and her computer
talked she started looking for information on the Sentinel. Since she
figured it would have been here for awhile she checked the oldest
files using parameters provided by Angel, Anya, and their research.
She was so focused on her task she barely registered Xander picking
something up on the radio he was carrying. They had spent some of
Angel's money to get a radio scanner that they had used for several
hours until they had the radio frequencies that security used.
Frequencies that had been programmed into a police walkie-talkie that
a sullen faced Angel had managed to acquire. That radio was now
reporting some difficulties with the security cameras.</p>

<p>His eyes first darted to the now dead cameras and then to
Willow. She silently apologized to the accusation in his eyes and
redoubled her efforts. Finally locating files, not in the past, but in
the present about the time of Angel's break in with a concern by
security about how close he had gotten to the Sentinel. That reference
led her to other files that she started downloading as fast as she
could as the door to Lindsey's office opened and two security guards
entered. Willow tried not to look scared as they turned to Xander and
started questioning him. "I've never seen you here before." Xander
nodded. "Yeah, I was hired after the break in." The guy's eyes
narrowed. "They make sure they introduce all new hires to the rest of
security. So why don't I know you?" They both saw that both guards'
hands had dropped to the guns at their waists. Xander shook his head.
"I don't know. Have you taken time off or something?" He shook his
head. "I got out of the hospital not three days after that fucker put
me in there and I haven't missed a day since.</p>

<p>Xander nodded. "That explains it. I was literally hired the
next day. With you guys already in the hospital they didn't want
themselves left vulnerable." The senior guard looked suspicious while
the junior one turned to look at Willow. "Hey, you stop whatever you
are doing." Xander immediately stepped in. "She's trying to get the
cameras back online." The senior guard spoke up again. "They hadn't
gone down until you two got here." Willow was the one to speak up this
time. "Yeah, but they still weren't working. They were showing footage
from several days ago, but with the office not being used nobody had
noticed until today." Both still seemed suspicious, but also looked a
little more relaxed. The senior officer spoke. "Be that as it may mam
you are tampering with our security, and I can't allow that until I
know for sure that you are supposed to be here." The hand that he had
resting on the butt of his pistol allowed no room for argument as he
took the other hand and reached for his radio. </p>

<p>The look on Xander's face begged Willow for a distraction and
she gave an almost invisible nod. "Ok, just let me save my work." She
then reached up and hit several keys. Suddenly the lights went out and
all Willow heard was the sounds of a scuffle and something that
sounded like an aerosol can, that was followed by some pained shouts.
When the emergency lights came on Xander was standing over the
unconscious forms of both the security guards with the can of mace
from his belt now in his hand. He turned to Willow. "All right Wills,
time to go." She nodded. "Just five more seconds." Then she
immediately began entering her own alphanumeric password into the
system. Xander had first stooped down and relieved the guards of their
pistols. "I don't think we have five seconds." He then peeked out the
door and quickly ducked back in. He tucked one guard's pistol into the
front of his pants while he took the other one in hand. "You have
three left tops."</p>

<p>She unplugged her cord from Lindsey's computer. "Don't need
them. I'm done. Now let's get out of here." He nodded and she slid up
to stand behind him. "Easier said then done. They have their weapons
drawn. So when we get out of here stay down and keep right behind me.
We're heading for the stairs because the elevators are not an option."
She nodded. "And out of order. I locked them down, and I shut off all
the lights in the building." He smiled. "Good work. Now let's go."
With out another word he flung the door wide and fired a shot into the
emergency light box. That threw them into deep shadow while it put the
approaching security into sharp focus. Almost looking like cardboard
cut outs at the National Guard firing range Xander treated them as
such as he raised the pistol and fired once at the dark blob above the
forms shoulders. Though the cardboard cut outs didn't scream and fall
to the ground as the guard did. Xander ignored that fact as he saw the
other two duck for cover and he grabbed Willow's hand to pull her
towards the stairwell. </p>

<p>The guards had not managed to return fire until they had
gotten to the stairs and even then they just hit the stairwell
doorway. Willow had pulled a freestanding ashtray from where they
passed a smoking area and used it to wedge the door closed. She had a
horrified look on her face when she turned to him. "You, you killed
him!" Her grabbed her by the shoulders. "Willow! Did you see those
stake things on their belts? They know what Wolfram and Heart do, and
they don't care. Vampires don't have a soul, but these guys do and
they are selling out the rest of humanity. So yeah I'll kill them.
I'll do what I have to in order to get this done and get back to
Anya." His voice then softened. "Willow, he had his gun out too, and
he could have kept you from ever getting back to Tara. I didn't like
killing him, but I know I'll like dying even less. Now we need to
run." She nodded and they started flying down the stairs. "I'm sorry
Xander." He shook his head. "No need to be. I'm probably going to
throw up once this is all over, but not before we're safe."</p>

<p>As they ran Xander unclipped his radio and changed the
frequency. "Bring the car around." That was the signal to Charles Gunn
to move his pick up into position to pick them up. Neither of them had
ever worked with Charles Gunn before, but their friends seemed to
trust him, and they just had to hope that was enough. When Xander
switched the radio back they heard security say that they had managed
to open the door they had wedged shut, and security beneath them had
started up the stairs. With out a second thought Xander kicked open
the door at the next stairwell they reached and marched out with
Willow one step behind. At first all they saw were the law office
workers cowering in fear of the unknown gunman, but those people were
then ignored as they ran for another doorway to another set of stairs.
Xander kicked that door down too, but as he did several pullets tore
through and struck him squarely in the chest and knocked him on his
back. While on some level Willow knew that he was wearing a
bulletproof vest the sight still made her scream in fear. </p>

<p>Xander however was already reacting as he pulled the other
guard's pistol from his belt and emptied both into the doorway. He
cast both pistols aside and grimaced as he stood up, drawing his own
pistol at the same time. His eyes frantically darted around until
Willow suddenly pointed to the fire exit. He nodded once as they both
ran towards it. Willow spoke as they ran. "Doesn't that hurt?" Xander
replied as they reached the door. "It will when the adrenaline wears
off." He raised his pistol and fired three shots into the fire door at
the halfway point. With no response he pushed that door open and added
the sound of the fire alarm to the chaos. Of course it didn't seem
that much in the steady ringing that had started after the exchange of
gunfire between Xander and the team behind the door. As the hit the
fire exit they ran at dangerous speeds down the stairs until Xander
pulled her to a stop where they saw the fire door beneath them
opening. </p>

<p>As a foot clad in regulation footwear stepped through Xander
pulled a egg shaped object from his pocket and pulled a pin, which let
the spool drop away. She was shock when he actually held it another
two seconds, but he then dropped it over the edge. Knowing what was
going to happen Willow clasped her hands over her hears, bit they
still started ringing when the explosion went off in the confined
space of the fire escape. With out looking behind him Xander grabbed
her hand with his free one and pulled her along behind him. Willow
closed her eyes as they passed the blast site and she allowed Xander
to guide her past. It actually was after they had passed Willow
slipped and fell hard on one knee. She saw the footprint she left when
she had slipped and realized it was because she had blood on her shoe.
She was about to throw up when Xander looked back at her. His "soldier
face" slipped for a second and he looked concerned. "Are you ok
Willow?" She took a breath and brought up Tara's face inside her mind.
The image of her lover seemed to bring a calm over her and she nodded
as she got up. Xander's face had slipped back into its solider
expression but it actually seemed calmer as he gave her a hand up.</p>

<p>"Can I have the mace?" He nodded again, and she thought that
if they weren't in combat he would have smiled. As he handed her the
can of mace they sped up, knowing they were almost to the ground
floor. However when they got out the door they found Gunn, and half a
dozen security guards. Of course four of the six were laid out in
front of, or underneath the grill of Gunn's pickup. The fifth was laid
out by the driver's side door. The problem was the sixth had his gun
out and pointed that the black man's shaven scalp. Xander slid one way
while Willow slid the other. Harris had his gun out and pointed at the
guard while they both stared each other down. "Put down your weapon or
I'll shoot him!" While the guard seemed almost panicked Xander was far
more calm. "You do and you die once second after." "Put down your
weapon and surrender!" Xander shook his head. "Not happening. You know
as well as I that we'll never see a jail cell." The guard looked even
more panicked as Xander continued to look calm, nothing in his
expression betraying that he could see his friend sliding closer to
the guards position. </p>

<p>He also knew that Willow was getting close and he had to make
sure that the guard was distracted. "Drop the weapon and you'll live
to collect your pension!" When Xander started yelling the guard
tightened his grip, but as he started to draw in the breath to speak
Willow sprang up and sprayed the can of mace into the guard's face.
Gunn might not have realized what had been happening, but there was no
way to know it was he ducked underneath the guard's pistol and forced
it up with both hands. As he drove his knee into the guard's crotch he
took one hand from the guard's gun and hit him underneath the chin.
The combined hits knocked the guard unconscious and he fell back,
connecting with Gunn's pickup before he hit the ground. Before he had
hit the ground Gunn was running to the drivers side while Willow
climbed in the passenger seat. As they did that Xander leapt into the
bed of the pickup. </p>

<p>They had started peeling out, but when Willow let Gunn know
that the cameras weren't on and their pictures hadn't been taken he
slowed down so they wouldn't attract any attention. As they started
back towards the Hyperion Gunn turned to Willow. "Did I hear a bomb go
off?" Willow smiled nervously. "Ummm, Xander used a grenade." Gunn
shook his head. "Great, I'm working with Timothy McVeigh." Willow
looked back over her shoulder and laughed. While in another part of LA
the slayers were having problems of their own.</p>
