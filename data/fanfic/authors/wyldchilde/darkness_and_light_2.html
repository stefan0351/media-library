<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>Riley Finn massaged his forehead as he examined the petite
form of his girlfriend Buffy Summers. While most could see how
energetic in how they walked through Sunnydale they couldn't conceive
the power held in the blonde's tiny frame. "Well Angel is over two
hundred years old. He should know what he's doing." She stopped and
put her hands on her hips. "Don't tell me your siding with him now?"
He held up his hands. "I'm just saying that from the information
Willow got she was released into his custody. He'll take care of her."
An odd look crossed Buffy's face and Riley stepped close to her. "Your
not jealous are you?" She looked offended. "Jealous? What do I have to
be jealous about?" He looked at the ground. "Well you and Angel… I
mean it is another girl, a slayer no less."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped and pulled Riley's chin up. "Riley, I'm over
Angel. I'm with you. Do you know what I told him? I said that what we
have is not what he and I had. It's very new. You know what makes it
new? I trust you. I know you." He smiled at that, and she smiled back,
but her expression darkened. "It's Faith. I mean she's getting away
with murder." He seemed to chuckle. "Well so is Angel." When he saw
her expression darken he realized he had said the wrong thing. "I
thought we had went over this with Oz. Things happened that Angel had
no control over." Riley wondered where it was coming from, but he
found himself defending Faith. "Yeah, but at least Faith's human." She
started walking again, and he was forced to break into a trot to keep
up. "I'm just talking degrees of evil, neither one of them are
saints."</p>

<p>She stopped. "Yeah, but like you said Faith's human. I mean I
tried to reach her Riley, I really did, but she wouldn't open up to
me. Angel comes along and she's crying in his arms! What does he have
that I don't?" "I guess it takes a killer to understand a killer." She
turned and looked at him. "What? So I'm too good for her?" He grinned.
"Well, you are." She smiled and swatted him in the arm. "No, I guess I
just mean that Angel's been there. I mean she knew he wouldn't judge
her." Buffy's voice softened. "Like I did." He seemed ready to
contradict her, but she interrupted him. "I WAS there Riley. I had to
walk in her shoes." He looked down again. "I remember." She absently
rubbed his forearm with her palm as she continued to speak softly. "I
just reached the point I couldn't let her keep hurting me."</p>

<p>He nodded. "Sometimes people just don't want to be helped and
you have to give up on them. I mean you were just trying to protect
yourself." "That's all Faith was doing." The two jumped as a third
voice spoke up. Angel stepped into the light and both glared at the
vampire. Buffy was the first to speak. "Well that, and all the
killing." Angel looked her directly in the eyes. "Yeah, it's scary
what a person is capable of when they think they have no other
choice." Riley saw the effect the vampire's words had on his
girlfriend. "What? Like not only drinking the blood of someone they
SUPPOSEDLY loved, but drinking nearly enough to kill them?" While
Angel had a nearly preternatural calm that managed to get through to
him.</p>

<p>"That was between Buffy and me. It doesn't involve you soldier
boy." Riley seemed almost eager as he stepped forward with his fists
clenched, and even Angel had a dangerous glint in his eye as Buffy
stepped between them. "No Riley, he's right. What ever happened
between me and Angel is in the past." Buffy was facing towards Riley
and away from Angel so she didn't see the look of hurt that crossed
Angel's ageless face. She put her hands on the soldier's forearms.
"Riley, it's you I'm with. I love you, have faith in that." The tender
expression on the petite blonde's features hardened as she turned
around. "I got out of your city Angel, now what are you doing in
mine?" "She's coming, tomorrow." The already cool expression on
Buffy's face hardened as she stared down Angel.</p>

<p>"So not only do you let her loose, but you let her loose on
US?" Angel shook his head as he stepped closer. Riley Finn was about
to step to intercept him but Buffy laid a hand back on his with out
ever taking her eyes from Angel as he spoke. "She's not here to hurt
you Buffy. She's here to help you." He continued as Buffy scoffed.
"Not with slaying. She wants to apologize, and then she will go." Her
eyes seem to snap at him before her voice did. "What? To find another
batch of victims?" Instead of snapping back Angel's eyes met her with
determination. "Buffy, all the things I did and you never held it
against me. Even when I did them to you." </p>

<p>While her face remained locked a careful observer could notice
a softening in her eyes and he took the opportunity to continue.
"Buffy, Faith is not asking you to trust her, or like her. She's not
asking you to do anything at all. She's just going to apologize. You
don't have to accept it. You don't even have to listen if you don't
want to. SHE wanted to try. She was the one who suggested coming back
here." Buffy's voice was still firm, but it didn't seem as sharp. "Was
she the one who got you to come down here and try to pave the way for
her?" Angel shook his head. "She doesn't even know I'm here. I just
thought I'd offer to let her stay at the mansion as long as she is
here, but I wanted to make it ready first. Running into you was just a
coincidence."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded sternly. "I was in LA a day, but I'll give her
three, and she stays at the mansion so I can keep an eye on her."
Angel looked saddened and nodded, but as he turned away her spoke.
"That's a lot of hate inside you Buffy. Now just try to imagine a
lifetimes worth." As he walked from view Buffy's posture was still
tensed, but as close as he was standing to her he detected a slight
tremble, and while Angel was too far away to see it the hard
expression was now confused and hurting. "Buffy?" "I am NOT like her."
She almost seemed in shock as Riley gently turned her to face him. "Of
course your not." "I'm not." "Buffy, you are NOTHING like her. You are
a strong, confident woman surrounded by people who love you."</p>

<p>While his words were meant to comfort they only seemed to
confuse and he put his arm around her waist. "Come on, let's get you
back to your dorm. We can cut patrolling short tonight." As they
walked he ran his hand in comforting circles on her back. "Come on
Buffy. This is what Faith feeds on. If you are going to be ready for
her you can't play her game." She looked up rather sharply. "Angel
said she was just here to say she's sorry." Riley shook his head. "I
guess she's better at playing people then we thought." She shook her
head, but the movement seemed wooden. And Riley continued. "Come
Buffy. It's perfect. She knows there is not case against her so she
makes a confession. Then after everyone thinks she's really going to
go through with it she recants it and gets set free to "make amends".
It all fits."</p>

<p>She shook her head again and he continued to speak. "Ok, my
feelings about Angel aside… if you loved him then he must be one of
the good guys. Faith knows that, and she played on it. I mean you said
it yourself." A look of horror crossed her face as she looked at him,
and it left him looking confused. She then took up a walk that was
just short of a run. "I… I gotta go." Before he could reply Buffy had
made it to her dorm room and slammed the door. While it made him
flinch on the outside of the door. It made her roommate jump, though
not bad enough for her to loose her pace in the book she was reading.
"Buffy? Buffy, are you all right?" All she could do was shake her head
no as she sat down on the edge of her bed. "It's Faith."</p>

<p>At the mention of the dark slayer the redhead got up and
whirled around as if she expected Faith to come crashing through a
window or materialize out of thin air. "She's not here, not yet."
Concern warred with confusion as Willow sat down next to Buffy. "It's
ok Buffy, well call Xander and Giles and well be ready for what ever
she's planning." Buffy shook her head. "She's not planning anything."
Skeptical would be a polite description of Willow's expression upon
hearing that. "Says who?" "Angel." "Oh." They both sat silently for
several minutes until Willow broke the silence. "Then what is she
coming here for?" Buffy took a deep breath. "To say she's sorry." At
that point simply skeptical described Willow as she looked at Buffy,
and Buffy nodded. "I know, I know. I can't believe it either, but I
mean how can I say no?"</p>

<p>"Like this…" Willow took a breath to speak, but didn't when
Buffy rolled her eyes. "Will, if she want to turn her life around… how
can I deny that too her. I mean look at me, when I ran away you guys
took me back. I had to work to regain your trust, but I had the
chance." Even though it was an exclamation Willow spoke softly.
"Buffy! You didn't kill anybody!" Buffy looked mournful. "I killed
Angel." "You didn't kill him. He's here, he's alive." A stray tear ran
down Buffy's cheek. "Ok, I sent him to hell. Is this supposed to make
me feel better?" The familiar site of Willow's "resolve face" greeted
Buffy Summers. "Buffy, either Angel went to hell, or the world did,
and he still made it back." "Yeah, but he went to hell and got a
second chance, what kind of monster would I be to deny a second chance
to Faith."</p>

<p>Willow sighed. "You'd be a realistic one Buffy. She's a
talented liar, I mean at one point she had us convinced she was you."
Buffy grinned. "Well having my body had to help her." Willow grinned
as well. "To be fair that helped her story." The two smiled, Willow
Rosenberg again took on breaking the silence. "So do you know what you
want to do?" The light slayer took a deep breath. "I told Angel she
had three days, and that she had to stay at the mansion so that I
could keep an eye on her." Willow again had her "resolve face" on. "So
that we can keep an eye on her." Buffy couldn't help but smile at her
friend's unconditional support when Willow spoke again. "Do we know
when she's getting here?" Buffy's eyes were down cast. "Tomorrow."</p>

<p>"It's not a lot of time to get ready, but we'll do it." Buffy
didn't lift her head, but she did smile. Willow's eyes looked sad for
her friend. "If she is telling the truth, will your be able to forgive
her?" Buffy fell backwards onto the bed. "That's the question isn't
it? I mean I want to, but I'm scared." "Scared?" Buffy nodded.
"Scared, I mean I'm the slayer, things try to kill me all the time,
but Faith's different. I let her in. It's almost like when Angel
turned, but… in LA she pleaded with me she just wanted to know how to
make it better." Willow slid back on the bed so she was sitting near
Buffy's shoulders. "What did you say?" Buffy sighed. "I didn't say
anything, I didn't get a chance. A council guy picked that moment to
come in shooting." "So you believe her?"</p>

<p>Buffy closed her eyes tightly. "I don't know Will, I believed
her then, but I don't know about now. I want to. I'm at least going to
listen." Willow then nodded. "I will too." Buffy opened one eye and
smiled up at Willow. She then opened the other and sat up, pulling the
redheaded hacker into a hug. "Ok, lets call Xander and Giles and let
them know. We can also meet at Giles house in the morning to go over
details. Willow nodded and got up to use the phone.</p>
