<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 13 -->

<p>Buffy slowly blinked the sleep from her eyes, and while that
veil parted the caresses she had thought were part of it remained. Now
that her eyes were open she looked into soulful brown eyes that looked
like they had gotten caught doing something they shouldn't. Buffy
smiled into them. "Don't worry Faith. I like it when you touch me.
Just let me be able to enjoy it too." While the hands had stopped when
Buffy awoke, they slowly began to move again while Faith grinned at
her. Buffy smiled contentedly as she groaned in pleasure. "That's it."
Buffy's eyes had drift shut at the dark slayer's touch, so when she
felt soft, full lips kissing along her collarbone she whimpered. Her
hands moved under their own power to run her fingers through a soft,
brown mane. As a timid knock sounded on their door both groaned
angrily.</p>

<p>Faith stood up and stalked to the door as she put on her robe.
Slamming open the door a frightened looking Xander stood there. He
first looked at the mussed up Faith clad in only her robe, and then a
mussed up, naked Buffy sitting up in bed with a blanket tucked up
underneath her arms. A small grin had made its way back onto his face
as he turned back to face her glare. "Your going to strangle me again
aren't you?" First Faith seemed taken back, but then she realized the
grin on Xander's face and smiled as she shook her head while he
started to speak. "Umm, everyone is awake and waiting… we even got
bagels, if you're hungry that is." They both seemed to perk up at food
and Faith grinned. "I know I'm hungry. How about you B?" Buffy just
rolled her eyes at the both of them.</p>

<p>Buffy then sighed. "I guess we better get ready." She looked
about to move, but then she and Faith turned to look at an openly
staring Xander. Faith smirked and then shut the door in his face.  As
she turned back to the bed Buffy was looking archly at her. "What? I
really am hungry." Then she spoke under her breath. "Since I won't be
able to take care of the other one any time soon." Buffy dropped the
sheet and climbed out of the bed. "I don't know about that." Faith
smiled happily as Buffy continued to speak while getting her clothes.
"But if you want me to help you then you're going to have to wait."
The plain expression on Buffy's face had turned into a grin as Faith
chuckled and started looking through her own clothing. She looked over
at Buffy. "I'm not sure what would fit, but if you want to borrow some
of my clothes you can.  You might want to keep some of your clothes
here too. You know, in case you stay over again another night."</p>

<p>Faith had been attempting to sound casual, but Buffy simply
smiled and put her hands on Faith's firm, round hips. Pulling the
brunette close she stood up on tiptoe and kissed her. "Faith, I just
spent the night in bed with you, naked." Buffy then kissed Faith
again. "It's not the last time either." Her voice then got soft. "For
the first time in my life I love someone I want to plan a life with."
Faith didn't even try to fight the way that made her smile as Buffy
said. "I'm making those plans." Faith then grinned. "Hey! Don't I get
a say in them?" Buffy smiled sweetly into Faith's face. "No." Faith's
lips twisted into a pout. "I thought I was the butch one." The two had
been dressing as they spoke, and then Buffy walked to the bedroom
door. "That's what I let you think." </p>

<p>With a giggle the smaller slayer then ran through the door and
slammed it shut behind her. Faith laughed and ran up to it. She tried
the handle and found it immobile. The sound of Buffy's giggling on the
other side of the door told her why. She tugged and pulled, but the
older slayer seemed able to hold the door closed while her voice came
through the door. "Try huffing and puffing!" Faith smirked as she
spoke into the door. "I'd rather try eating you!" The voice on the
other side paused. "You'll have to catch me first!" Faith then tried
the door again and was able to open it this time. She yanked it open
to see the back of a rapidly retreating Buffy. She then took off in
pursuit. The giggling slayer led her on a chase to the main room, and
then just stopped suddenly. </p>

<p>Faith crashed into her deliberately as she wrapped her arms
around the smaller frame and lifted her off the ground. "Gotcha Now!"
She then realized they were not alone. Looking up she saw the rest of
the Scoobies smiling at them brightly. Even the uninterested Anya
seemed to make the effort to look pleasant. They all stood silently,
the Scoobies smiling brightly while the slayers fought not to blush.
Giles was the first to break the silence. "Nice of you two to join us.
Willow has already tracked down some of the equipment removed from the
Initiative complex. Considering his recent interest it seems our best
bet for finding him." Both of the slayers nodded, still not speaking.</p>

<p>Giles continued. "With Xander's military knowledge and
Willow's technical skills I believe they are essential. Unfortunately
we need to keep a presence here to keep the police occupied." Xander
then piped up. "That and there is no possible way we would all fit
inside your car." Giles rolled his eyes. "Yes, so Tara, Anya and
myself will stay here at the mansion and attempt the location spell to
find Riley." Faith smirked. "You think you'll be able to handle spell
stuff with the G-man Tara?" The shy blonde simply blushed as Willow
gave Faith a friendly glare. Giles started cleaning his glasses.
"Actually I am aware of the union she and Willow share, and it's
possible effects on her magic. I actually intend to assist her with
the research and then keep watch with Anya."</p>

<p>Faith smirked. "I was teasing Giles." He put his glasses on.
"Of course. We don't have much time before sun set. So I suggest you
get going." Buffy then spoke up. What about the photo line up thing?"
Giles then nodded. "Quite right. I will offer to go down to the
station and keep them busy." Xander was up and pulling the slayers
towards the door after he picked up the keys to the car. "All right,
sounds good. Say hi to Officer Don for us." Willow followed behind
after pausing, smiling and then giving Tara a kiss. Leaving the other
Wiccan sitting in the couch blushing deeply. Of course when she saw
Giles and Anya looking at her she simply blushed deeper.
 </p>
<p>Xander was sliding into the drivers seat as Willow took the
passenger seat and the slayers climbed in back. "All right ladies?
Where can I take you?" Buffy blinked. "Um, you know the location
Xander, not us." He paused. "Right." Then he started the engine. As
the old car engine labored to life Faith leaned forward in her seat.
"Way to make with the PDA Red." Willow smiled and blushed. "Well I
figured if you guys could do it then I could too." They both finally
did seem shy as Faith laid back in her seat and took Buffy's hand.
"Yeah." They all sat silently until they started to notice Xander's
frequent looks in the rearview mirror. Faith, Buffy and Willow smirked
in unison as Buffy spoke. "Xander? Is someone following us?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The boy behind the wheel started blushing furiously. "Nope,
just want to make sure." The girls simply arched their brows at each
other as Buffy spoke again. "Way to be vigilant Xander." Willow spoke
up next. "Here we are!" The armory stood before them, and Xander slid
forward in his seat as they approached the gate. When the guard didn't
get up from his seat inside the booth they got worried and then pulled
back and parked Giles car on the street. As they got out they went in
and saw the guard had died at his post of two puncture wounds, and
then had been sat back down as if he were still on duty. Quietly
Xander slipped off the man's web belt and put it on. Picking up the
guard's rifle he turned around into the slightly disturbed faces of
Buffy, Faith and Willow. "They won't do him much good, but they might
help us get him some pay back."</p>

<p>They all stared at him as Buffy spoke. "Bullets don't kill
vampires Xander, you know that." He shrugged. "Yeah, but I think
you'll have an easier time staking Spike if he has half a dozen rounds
in him." As they left Xander slid into the front and Buffy nudged him
aside. Faith the spoke up. "Ok, when did you go Rambo?" Xander
blinked. "It's a military base, and with the skills Ethan gave me it's
sort of my environment." Buffy looked at him several seconds. "Well
it's vampires we're dealing with and they are mine." "Sorry mam."
Buffy and Willow gawked while Faith grinned at Buffy's expression when
she spoke. "Mam? When did I become a mam?" Xander seemed to shake
himself. "Sorry, Buffy." She seemed to eye him a bit and then stepped
in front and led the group further into the complex, first entering a
garage area.</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith took the lead while Willow slid into the
middle and Xander took up guarding the back, holding the rifle to his
shoulder as he kept it sweeping the area. Willow then heard Xander
speak. "They have a National Guard unit here don't they?" Willow
nodded absently. "Yeah, but I thought you didn't want to join the
Army." "But it's not the Army. It's the National Guard. I would still
be in the area, and I would have better access to gear." He fell
silent as he seemed to consider the idea, at least until Buffy and
Faith both stopped abruptly. They paused and then Buffy whispered over
her shoulder. "Vamp, dead ahead. Try not to shoot us too Xander." He
looked offended, but replied by tightening his grip on the rifle. The
slayers left Willow by Xander and spread up from the position.</p>

<p>The concrete floor insisted on displaying their footsteps, but
the open area also caused enough echoes to mask their exact location.
As they slipped closer to the vampire they detected they could hear
that the vampire was pacing. When they got close enough to see him
they could see it was Spike. Before Faith realized it Buffy had raced
across the space between her and Spike and slammed him against the
nearest wall. The wall in question was made of steel and concrete, or
so Faith assumed as she heard Spike's head slammed against it. Buffy
didn't seem to notice as she had one forearm across Spike's windpipe
while the other hand held a stake poised right above his heart. You
could never tell as much from Spike's voice as he started talking.
"Slayer, so you found the trail I left did you?" Buffy rolled her
eyes, took her hand from his windpipe and grabbed him by the front of
the shirt. She then proceeded to pull him back and then slam him back
into the wall. </p>

<p>"Now, now. I'm sure you want to blame me for all this, but
your ex is the one who took the leash off." Buffy growled. "Then you
promptly turned around and bit him." Spike smirked. "I'm a vampire.
Biting is what I do." "Well now you're going to bite the dust." She
drew back the stake, but Faith then stepped forward while she heard
Xander and Willow approach.  "Buffy, think. Why isn't he fighting
back?" Buffy seemed to consider that and her grip loosened. Spike
shrugged free, but then made no other move. "Quite right. I turned
Nancy boy in order to make sure he would be willing to take out the
chip and he turns around, stabs me in the back, and turns it back on!"
Xander had dropped the rifle to hold it at his hip. "He's a vampire,
that's what they do."</p>

<p>Spike growled at Harris, but the man didn't even flinch. Faith
noticed Buffy was almost as pale as Spike was and she stepped close.
"B? You ok?" Buffy shook her head and spoke in a very small voice.
"He's one of them now." She stepped close and took Buffy in her arms,
resting the smaller slayer's head to her chest. "Don't worry. I'll
stake him for you. You won't have to do it." Spike stepped closer and
examined the couple with a smirk on his face. "Well what do you know,
Riley was right you WERE out to bag Buffy." They both turned to glare
at him and he lost his smirk. "Which I think is a beautiful thing, you
know? Gay pride and what not." Buffy slipped from Faith's arms and
stormed up to Spike. "You may be defenseless, but don't think I'm
going to forget that you made him into a monster.</p>

<p>Spike looked down into the raging eyes of Buffy Summers.
"Let's be honest here Slayer. He was already a monster. If he wasn't
then how would he have been able to let me loose to kill Faith?" He
then lit a cigarette. "Just because it has a pulse doesn't mean it's
human." He noticed Faith regarding him rather intently. "Don't worry
pet. When he put the leash back on I pretty much gave up the whole
idea of killing you for him." Faith smirked. "Thanks, what about the
other way around?" Spike nodded. "Unlike my own shit head sire I won't
let my bad seed run around for centuries." Then they heard another
voice. "Well, well, two slayers, every vampire's fantasy." Riley Finn
stepped into sight, full game face on and a swarm of demons behind him.</p>
