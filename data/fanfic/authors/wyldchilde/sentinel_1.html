<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>"Hey Giles? What's "The Sentinel" besides a failed show from
UPN?" The Watcher turned to face Willow Rosenberg as he answered her
question. "The what?" She pointed at the book she was in the process
of scanning, and started reading a passage. "The Sentinel, the light's
guardian at the mouth of Hell until the end of days." He straightened
his glasses and moved to read over her shoulder as she continued. "I
mean since we live on the mouth of Hell and all I figured it might be
something we should know about." "What should we know about?" Both
Willow and Giles looked up abruptly at the appearance of the slayers.
Giles then looked at Buffy. "I believe you should learn how to knock."
She just grinned at him as the pair tried to squeeze in and see what
they were looking at.</p>

<p>He then took a breath. "Well, according to this book The
Sentinel is "A champion of light sent to stand guard at the gates of
Hell until the end of the world." Faith then spoke. "Well he must be
asleep at the wheel when you think about how many times we've had to
keep the Hellmouth from opening."  Giles shook his head as he
continued to read. "No, it says that the darkness learned of his
mission and fielded an army to stop him, yet "No claw, nor fang, nor
blade, nor burn could fell him." In the end they had to chain him up
and seal him in stone." Buffy scrunched in closer. "He kinda sounds
like The Judge." Giles shrugged. "Well perhaps he was his counter
part, a being of similar age and power. Either way I believe this
deserves more research. To start I believe we should go through the
books we managed to recover from Dracula's lair." Willow smiled.
"After Faith suggested it." Faith smirked. "Well I like to think of it
as a kinder, gentler version of "want, take, have" I mean it's my job
to dust them anyways. So I see no reason not to take their stuff.
Bastard should have known better then to try for my girl. No one
nibbles on B's neck but me."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Faith. "Yeah, yeah. Well he wasn't able to get
into the mansion, and Spike was a great help in tracking him down, and
between us we finished him off nicely." Willow then quirked her brow.
"Speaking of Spike, where is he?" Faith smirked once more. "Well when
I last saw him he was in the chick pit with the Brides of Dracula."
Giles gave Faith a surprised expression. "Didn't you help him?" Faith
laughed at that. "I believe his exact words were. "Bugger off, or I
swear chip or no I'll kill you." Buffy smiled. "Well I'll trust that
Spike will do the right thing, eventually. I'm more worried about
Xander, even as Dracula's "man-bitch" he was still pretty dangerous
with a gun." Willow was entering commands into her laptop computer as
she spoke. "I think he's ok. I mean he and Anya are already out
apartment hunting, and he's signed up for the guard." Buffy nodded.
"Still, let's try him anyway, if he brings Anya that's another set of
eyes."</p>

<p>Faith seemed to think. "Should we get Spike too?" Buffy nodded
once more. "Yeah, I mean Spike was one of those reassembling The
Judge, so he might know something, and even if he doesn't he is
another set of eyes." Faith laughed. "It will be worth it just to see
Spike helping with research." Willow then looked up. "I'll call him."
The other three people in the room looked at her wide eyed and she
smiled. "I set Spike up with phone service." The all seemed startled
when Buffy then spoke. "All right, then will you call him?" Willow
smiled. "I'll call Tara, Xander, and Anya too." They nodded as a group
and as Willow moved to the phone Giles picked up several books and
stacked them as he moved to a fresh tabletop. "So B, you really trust
Spike to help us?" Buffy grinned. "TRUST is probably a little strong,
but you do, and I trust you."</p>

<p>Faith rolled her tongue inside her mouth. "Great, so my good
word is at stake." Buffy slid closer and gave Faith a hug. "Nah, you
just got me whipped." Faith pressed into the hug. "You saying you've
been a naughty slayer?" Buffy inched up and gave Faith a kiss. "I
thought you were the naughty slayer." Faith pressed harder into the
kiss. "I am, very, VERY naughty, but I picked up a case of
responsibility somewhere along the line. I guess I should have used
protection." Giles looked up and spoke dryly. "Don't worry. It seems
to be a mild case." The two girls stared at him for several beats as
Buffy spoke. "Right, research." Faith spoke right after her.
"Research."  The two girls sat down at the main table and cracked open
books. Buffy then whispered to Faith. "Still, if Whistler could go
good maybe Spike could to." Faith arched a brow. "Right."</p>

<p>Buffy grinned and then Faith did as well and the two fell
silent, the only sound in the room being the turning of pages and the
sounds of Willow on the phone. Once she had finished making the calls
a total silence took over until it was broken by the arrival of Xander
and his girlfriend Anya, who also did not knock. Something Giles felt
the need to comment on. "It seem that all the expense of putting in a
knocker was a waste." Buffy gave her Watcher a confused glance.
"Didn't it come with the house?" The Englishman stammered as he looked
back down at his book. Xander smirked at Giles and then looked at
Buffy. "So what's the what? All new baddie? Or a classic on their
comeback tour?" Buffy shook her head. "Neither, it's… well what is it
exactly?" Giles seemed ready to answer but in her excitement Willow
beat him to it. "Well, you know all those dark evil things trying to
open up the Hellmouth and let all the demons back in?"</p>

<p>Xander nodded. "I seem to remember half a dozen or so."
Willow had already been smiling. "Well this is something to counter
that." He looked confused. "So what? It will close the Hellmouth?"
This time Giles was the one to answer. "Not close it, but ward it, bar
evil from opening it." Xander clapped his hands together. "All righty,
let's find ourselves the deadbolt of the gods." Anya then spoke up.
"You mean The Sentinel?" They all looked up rather abruptly and Anya
seemed startled by the scrutiny as Giles spoke to her. "You've heard
of it?" She shrugged. "Well ya. That's what took out my predecessor if
you know what I mean." Giles seemed confused. "Why would a vengeance
demon challenge the guardian of the Hellmouth?" She then shook her
head. "Didn't challenge as much as was ordered to." I mean to hear it
there were forces getting together every demon they could find to take
down the big bad, or big good… thing."</p>

<p>Giles got up and led her to the couch as the rest of the
Scoobies that were present followed. As he sat her down and sat next
to her he spoke quietly, yet urgently. "Ok Anya, we need you to tell
us EVERYTHING you can remember about The Sentinel." She nodded slowly
as she started to speak. "Well, I mean it's not that much. But
basically there was talk of the gates of Hell finally being sealed. I
mean really sealed not just the normal barrier between dimensions kind
of stuff. Needless to say most of the bigger demons were mad, the
smaller ones, well they pretended to be mad but they were mostly
scared. So all the big ones got all the little ones together and they
all marched to meet this Sentinel who was going to stand over the
Hellmouth and guard it. I never did hear any exact numbers, but I
think that's because they didn't want anyone to know just how many
demons died in the fight. I just know that the world's population of
demons declined. Still they fought, they died, he didn't. So they
managed to chain him up and seal him in this big obsidian block."</p>

<p>Giles was the first to speak. "All right, you identified it as
him. Are you sure it was a male? Also, there was no mention it was
obsidian, are you sure that's what they sealed the Sentinel up in?"
Anya nodded as she spoke. "Yeah he was real clear on the obsidian
part, bragging really. As far as The Sentinel being male, it was
actually referred to as it. I guess I just pictured it as male."
Everyone seemed to be digesting that, except Faith who spoke. "I
dunno, I guess I was thinking a girl." Xander smirked. "That's not
suprising." Faith grinned and blew him a kiss, but then Buffy spoke as
well. "No, no, I thought of it as female too." Xander then shrugged.
"Again, I say not suprising. What's the point?" Giles let out his
breath slowly before he spoke. "It may be nothing, but we know the
first evil transcended physical form and simply took on what ever
shape that suited it. While I doubt this Sentinel would be on THAT
level it may be of similar power."</p>

<p>Willow spoke up then, her face scrunched up in thought. "So
instead of dealing with an ancient evil were dealing with an ancient
good?" Giles took off his glasses and began cleaning them. "I believe
so, and it's an ancient good that needs our help." Buffy held up her
hands. "Wait, wait. How do we know that it's just not something
worse?" Anya was the one to answer as she shook her head vigorously.
"Oh no, no. Demons considered this… guy just short of a demonic
apocalypse. I mean like a manifest divine wrath sort of thing." Faith
supported Anya as she spoke. "I believe it B. I mean Angel told me all
about these "Powers That Be" guys." Faith's words seem to jar the
entire group silent until Buffy spoke. "Angel?" Buffy then took
another breath before speaking. "You said he has a direct connection
to them." Faith grinned at her partner. "I wouldn't say "direct" I
mean it IS Cordelia, but yeah they do seem to have a direct interest
in the big guy."</p>

<p>Buffy then spoke. "Maybe we should call him." At that precise
moment the phone rang, and then gathered Scoobies fell silent. As it
continued to ring they looked at each other with wide eyes until Faith
walked over and picked up the receiver. "Hello? Wesley? Ok, that's
just wicked creepy. What? Well we were literally just about to call
you guys. Oh she did, and it said to call me, but nothing else? Ok…"
As Faith went into the details with her former Watcher they Scoobies
looked at each other, and Xander broke the silence. "Wow, these Powers
That Be don't play around." They all nodded and waited quietly while
Faith finished talking with Wesley. As she came back she sat down.
"Well, the big guy is on his way, and he'll be bringing Wesley, Queen
C, and some guy named Gunn." They all seemed surprised at this and
Faith continued. "With two N's." They then nodded.</p>

<p>Giles then took the lead. "Until they arrive I believe we
should get back to research. So we can have as much ready as possible
for when they do arrive." They all nodded and settled back to their
research, but instead of sitting back down by her girlfriend Faith,
Buffy slid over by her best friend Willow. "Hey Willow, don't worry.
Tara will be here." Willow gave her friend a grin. "Am I that obvious?
I'm just worried I mean after she got kidnapped…" Buffy noticed her
friends pause and laid a comforting hand on Willow's shoulder. "After
she got kidnapped by Riley. I mean it wasn't Riley, but it was."
Willow nodded. "I mean before if she was in danger at least I was
there to protect her… well except for when Oz wolfed out." Buffy then
smiled at her and twisted her head to meet Willow's eyes as they
looked at the floor. "But don't you see Willow? She handled all that
on her own. I mean it's like a Scooby right of passage, and now she's
an official one of us. Would you worry about Xander, or Giles? I mean
you might worry about them being hurt, but you know they can take care
of themselves, right?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded slowly as Buffy smiled. "And so can Tara."
Willow continued to nod. "It's just that I love her…" Buffy smiled and
looked over at the silently reading Faith. Willow followed her eyes.
"Yeah, but she a slayer." Buffy smiled sadly. "Yeah, but that means
that she'll be looking for danger." Willow smiled subtly at her. "Well
so do you." Buffy returned the smile. "Yeah, but I don't love me like
I love her." Willow's smile grew into a grin and Buffy continued.
"You're not understanding the whole irrational love thing." Willow
shook her head, and then nodded as she spoke. "Oh no, I understand."
"Would you like me and Faith to go looking for her?" Willow's response
came right away. "No, no, it's one thing for me to worry irrationally,
but I don't want her to think that I don't think she can take care of
herself." Buffy grinned. "So ten minutes then Faith and I go out
looking?" "If you wouldn't mind?" The two friends grinned at each
other as they started reading again.</p>

<p>The slayers stayed in because Tara arrived not more then five
minutes later, a polite knock that was greeted by Giles. "Finally, one
of us knows how to knock." Tara smiled shyly at that and slipped by
the Watcher. She stopped in front of her partner who had stood up
smiling. The two Wiccan's held hands and leaned in to share a light
kiss in a brief bush of lips. Tara's expression changed to a
questioning one. "You were worried." The fact it was not even a
question caused Willow to blush even deeper then she would have
normally. "Well a little." "I…I'm sorry I took so long. I just wanted
to check our library for anything on this Sentinel." Willow looked
surprised. "We had something on the Sentinel?" Tara shook her head.
"No, but I wanted to check." Willow smiled broadly and Tara's smile
was shy. Giles was the one who broke the moment, but he did it gently.</p>

<p>"Well, that's not suprising. It was only when we were looting
Dracula's castle that we found the books pertaining to the Sentinel."
Tara nodded. "So, a…are these it?" Giles nodded and Tara looked for a
place to sit. Buffy grinned at her and stood up. While Tara's
answering grin seemed a bit unsure it was there as Buffy moved over to
sit by Faith. "Well hello stranger." Buffy first answered Faith by
giving her a kiss. "Well hello yourself." "Doing the best friend
thing?" Buffy smiled. "Yeah. You know you need to get yourself a best
friend. I mean besides me of course." Faith chuckled, then paused. "I
do have a best friend… well I don't know about "best" but we hang when
you and I aren't." Buffy smiled widely. "Really? Anyone I know?" At
that Faith's attempts not to grin failed. "It's Spike." Buffy rolled
her eyes. "Yeah right Faith, you hanging out with Spike." When the
dark slayers expression didn't flinch the light slayer's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Come on, your kidding. Aren't you?" Faith shook her head.
"No, I mean he's in the know. You know so he knows the full pressures
of being a slayer." Buffy's jaw had been slightly open before she
spoke. "Yeah because he's killed two of them." Faith shrugged as her
expression darkened slightly. "Yeah, but with Spike I know what ever I
have done he's done a million times worse. It's strangely comforting."
With out a word she stood up, picked up the books they were looking at
and carried them to the couch. As Faith and everyone else in the room
looked on confusedly she walked back and took Faith's hands. Pulling
Faith to her feet she led her over to the couch. She then sat down and
pulled Faith to sit between her legs on the couch and rest her back to
Buffy's chest. While Buffy was entirely calm doing this Faith was
blushing like crazy, and when her partner handed her the book she
wasted no time burying her nose in it.</p>
