<p>They soon realized the weapons was actually a singular weapon,
but it seemed to be enough as it had driven them back to the door they
came in through and was pinning them down there. The firing stopped as
they slid several feet back into the tunnel, but everyone knew the
unseen gunman was just waiting for another target to show itself. They
all hugged the walls, but hunched over as if in a huddle. Buffy again
assumed the leadership role as she spoke. "Ok, we need to get to the
gunman." Xander then spoke up. "The area isn't that big. If someone
can distract the shooter I can nail him." Faith the spoke. "I'll do
it." Buffy immediately shook her head, but Faith reached out and
touched her bicep. "B, partners, remember, and it needs to be done."
Buffy seemed ready to argue. "Faith doesn't need to. I mean we already
have someone who's immune to gunfire."</p>

<p>Three sets of eyes latched on to the bleached blonde vampire.
"What? Oh no you don't! I'm not immune." Buffy was almost grinning at
Spike. "Close enough." Spike looked and saw three sets of eyes that
said he was running out there, or he was being pushed. He growled and
slid up closer to the entrance. "Make it quick. I have no desire to
increase my lead intake." Xander simply grinned. "Just try to take the
shots to the body so you'll still be able to walk." The vampire
growled over his shoulder as Xander readied his submachine gun and
slipped behind Spike. As they were counting down a rush of footfalls
was heard and demons rushed up to them. Xander looked torn, but
shouted. "He's trying to push us to the sniper." Buffy yelled back.
"Do it! Faith and I will hold them off." Of course the dark slayer was
already in the process of doing so as she slipped under the swing of a
hulkish green brute.</p>

<p>The creatures mammoth arms had ended up going high, but it
then attacked with insect like pincers, the set having one on each
side of his mouth. Faith managed to side step that, and was even able
to being her blade in an upward slash between the pincers. While the
wound was more messy then painful it distracted the creature long
enough for Buffy to step up and use her longer blade to remove the
creatures head.  Yet as the beast fell the girls realized that the
only reason he attacked alone was because the tunnel was so full his
massive size kept the others from moving forward. As the saw the
gathered throng Faith quickly handed Buffy one of the knives for her
otherwise free hand and took out two fresh ones for herself.</p>

<p>On the other end of the tunnel Spike had dashed out and
surprisingly managed to avoid the bullets seeking to cut him down.
Xander had already stood up and managed to locate the muzzle flashes
from their shooter. As the weapon fell silent Xander quickly strode
into the bay. With out a second thought he pulled a fragmentary
grenade from his web harness and hurled it at the sniper's position.
As the boom echoed Spike looked at him. "Isn't that a bit much?"
Xander was panting from exertion. "It worked didn't it?" "Xander?"
Buffy's voice echoed in the aftermath of the explosion. "Bay is
secure, fall back!" Spike seemed to be chuckling at him. "Careful, you
may have a soldier's mind, but you certainly don't have his body."
Xander looked offended at that, but didn't have time to reply as the
slayers ran into the bay. Again with out a second thought he tore
another grenade free, pulled the pin, and the let it sit a second to
avoid any nasty throwbacks and then hurled the grenade into the
tunnel. </p>

<p>The slayers already saw the grenade as he was preparing it and
got out of the way. They slipped back next to the other two and looked
into the hallway. Nothing stirred so they slipped forward and when
they looked into the hallway it looked like hell's own abattoir filled
with it's own monstrous inhabitants. From the elevator shaft they had
climbed down to mere feet from the entry was piled with bodies or
slick with blood. Now that the adrenaline from that fight had
seemingly wore off the humans seemed disgusted by the carnage, while
the vampire seemed amused. While most creatures were finished by bombs
or bullets or the skilled blades of the slayers there was an
occasional twitching which earned a quick mercy shot courtesy of
Xander's .45. Though it was more a matter of making sure they would
not return to haunt them then any sense of mercy towards the demons.</p>

<p>They returned to the bay and Buffy stepped in front of the
group. "Ok we need to find Giles and Tara, and we need to stop Riley."
While she saw the blonde vampire start to scoff she glared at him.
"You stole one life Spike, now you better try to make it up by saving
two."  He sneered at her, but his posture deflated and she knew she
had him. He then spoke. "Actually you might want to pair me off with
your sweet thing. She and I have no qualms about staking your ex, and
if you have Xander with he would be good if Riley tries to use any
soldier crap." Buffy looked suspicious, but seemed to think it was a
good plan as she nodded. Faith then lightly took her hand and pulled
Buffy into an embrace. The two shared a kiss that was soft, sweet and
promising, both promising to return and demanding that same promise.
Spike smirked. "Well now, isn't that just sweet, makes me wish I had a
Kodak camera."</p>

<p>Xander then spoke. "For once Spike I think we agree." Both
girls looked annoyed at they paired up with each of the guys and split
up. Spike and Faith going back into the one active hallway while
Xander and Buffy went down to the bay to explore the experimentation
chambers. As the light haired woman and the dark haired man entered
into the bay they both gawked at the area unlit by the lights that had
been restored to the rest of the uncovered complex. "Buffy?" "Yes
Xander?" "The lights are out right? I just haven't gone blind?" "There
out Xander." At that he turned on a small flashlight he had mounted
underneath his submachine gun. "Then why do I hear a generator?" "I
don't know Xander." With out another word the two began to walk
towards the steady mechanic hum.</p>

<p>"You know I can't blame you." Faith didn't even look over her
shoulder. "Not suprising, you're a demon, but I'm not. The things I
did were inexcusable." Spike laughed. "No, no, not your walk on the
dark side. I mean I can't blame you for going after Buffy. Trim,
athletic… flexible." Spike seemed to drift off. "Hey, bleach boy!
Focus!" Spike snapped back to attention. "Oh yeah, do you think blonde
is HER natural color?" Faith scowled at him as she continued to try to
focus her senses on the halls around them. "How would you know that?"
"Angel, or more Angelus really, wanker is such a blow hard he loved to
talk about how he shagged a slayer. Especially since it was what
allowed him to make his big come back." "Spike, your disgusting, and
considering that I'm the one to say that it means a lot." </p>

<p>Spikes voice then seemed to drift over her shoulder. "Yes, but
that means I'm not about to judge you, and if you think about it we
not that different you and I." She stopped at that and turned around
to face him. "You're a demon! I'm NOTHING like you!" He actually
seemed to get quiet at that, seemed to mental drift somewhere else.
"But you could have been, A few months ago if you had met up with
Angelus and he took a fancy to you. Don't get me wrong pet, I'm evil,
done things far worse then you ever have and enjoyed them, but I'm not
one of the world conquering dip shits and I don't want to drag the
world down into hell. It's far too interesting. I just know what I am
and revel in it." She looked at him. "So what the fuck are you
saying?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I had my black goddess, you found your white
one. Guess I just realize we have plenty in common." Faith looked
incredulous. "What? So you want to get together for a villain's night
out, or former villain's night out?" Spike shrugged. "Got something
better to do?" She actually grinned at that, somewhat astounded, but
she grinned. Before she was able to respond a third voice broke in.
"Sounds great, maybe we could start a bowling league." Both scattered
a far apart as the hallway allowed while Faith hurled her stake in the
direction of the voice. "Stake me once shame on you, stake me twice
shame on me." Riley Finn was in Initiative uniform complete with
assault rifle, but complimented by his vampiric ridges. Faith's hurled
stake was gripped tightly in his left hand while the rifle's grip was
held in his right. He pulped the stake in his grip, but the
distraction allowed Spike to dash across the distance and rip the
assault rifle from his grasp.</p>

<p>As Spike tore out the rifle's magazine and threw both as far
as he could away from Riley the younger vampire growled at him and he
smirked. "Now, now what kind of sire would I be if I let you play with
guns?" He drew his handgun and pointed it at Spike's head. "An
absentee one?" Before he was able to pull the trigger Faith drove her
palm to the ulna nerve, and even though dead it still made his drop
the gun. Spike grabbed him by the throat and slammed him back against
the wall. "Nope, none of that absentee sire, my own sire did enough of
that." Before Spike was able to complete the move Riley bought a knee
up and with his knee and his arms he was able to drive Spike backward.
Before he was able to get the other foot back to the ground Faith
grabbed it with one hand and used the other to sweep his foot out from
underneath him. Yet as he crashed to the floor his feet were able to
connect enough to drive Faith back. </p>

<p>He rolled away from the two of them and rolled to his feet.
"What? So we slaughter some Boy scouts on a sire/childe camping trip?"
Spike grinned. "I was thinking more of a "I brought you into this
underworld and I'll take you out." Riley growled and turned to run but
Spike knew where he had thrown the rifle and saw Riley was heading
towards it. So he scooped up the pistol and fired down that hallway to
drive Riley down one that he saw ran into a wall of concrete. As the
weapon clicked empty he and Faith began sprinting down the hallway.
The dark slayer never pausing, but drawing two stakes in midstride,
keeping one for herself and handing one to Spike. The two wiped around
the corner and the taller Spike was taken off his feet by a
clothesline from the well-muscled arm of Riley Finn.</p>

<p>Faith was able to duck under the swing and drove her stake
unerringly at the vampire's heart. Yet instead of feeling the sinking
into flesh followed by that resistance vanishing she felt the stake
hit something hard and the tip break off. The answering grin was
hideous. "Kevlar vest with titanium trauma plate. The thing is made to
shrug off bullets, bitch!" She reversed the stake and hit him hard
enough to rock him on his feet as she slipped past him. With a safe
distance between them she was able to pull one of her knives. Faith
had been trying to distract Riley from Spike and the tactic was
successful as the prone vampire drove one of his booted feet up and
into the undead soldier's groin. While the crunching sound said that
Riley had remembered to wear his cup it didn't stand up under the
crushing force his sire was able to apply.</p>

<p>Spike grinned from the floor, as Riley seemed to fold in on
himself. "Guess there not titanium are they?" While Spike got up
gloating, Faith didn't waste a second. She guessed that the armor
focused on protecting the front and back and would then have its
straps on the side. So that's where she struck. Stabbing her bade in
by his hip she jerked it up and encountered more resistance than flesh
could provide. That was sufficient encouragement to drag the blade up
with all the force she could muster. Then it got near the top and
Riley was able to twist free, though he still seemed to be favoring
his injured privates. Spike then dashed in behind him and yanked the
armor plate back. There was a ripping sound and Riley's chest seemed
to become misshapen. Faith saw Spike's discarded stake and dove for
it.</p>

<p>Riley brought his foot up to stop on her, but Spike saw it
coming as punched his childe across the jaw. Riley snapped back his
elbow and caught his sire square between the eyes, which rocked the
older vampire and sent his careening back dazed. It still provided
Faith the opening she needed as she rolled to one knee and used the
forward motion to drive the stake inward and upward. She instantly
recognized when the stake hit heart tissue, but even if she didn't the
blatant look of disbelief on Riley Finn's face would have. A look that
seemed to remain as his body crumbled to dust. As Spike regained his
senses he grinned. "We're not half bad as a team. What do ya say?
Looking for your own brooding vampiric beau?" His answer was another
hard blow between the eyes as Faith slugged him.</p>

<p>"You're lucky it's just me Spike. Buffy would have staked you,
chip or no chip." He got up grumbling. "What? So you're already
Buffy-whipped?" Faith smiled. "Mind, body and soul." Spike shrugged.
"So is she the tiger in the sack Angel said she was?" He ducked as he
saw her about to hit him again. "I wouldn't know." He looked shocked.
"What you've already pledged your body to her and you haven't even
given her a test run? I'm disappointed." Faith shrugged. "Guess we're
not as alike as you thought. Now lets look for Giles are Tara."</p>

<p>Xander's voice was awed. "Well now we know why Riley was so
attached to the place. Prime location, right next to the university,
on the bus lines, oh and it's own nuclear reactor." Faith and Spike
had managed to find the Watcher and the Wiccan down the hallway that
Riley was trying to run down, and they uncuffed them. Once Faith had
finished yelling at Spike over the bullet holes in the door that led
to where the two had been held they had went in search of Buffy and
Xander. After passing the bodies of several demons that suffered a
combination of cuts and bullet wounds they found the two staring open
mouthed at a nuclear reactor. </p>

<p>Faith slid close to Buffy and took her hand, which caused the
light slayer to grip Faith hand and smile at her. "So, we safe here
Xander?" That caused him to stop gaping and look over his shoulder at
Faith. "Oh yeah, there would be warnings posted if we had entered an
area with a radiation risk." Faith didn't sound convinced. "Are you
sure they didn't break something when digging this place out?" Buffy
was the one to answer that. "This area wasn't filled in." Everyone but
Xander turned to look at her as she continued. "It looks like there
was someone who wanted to keep the Initiative an option." Xander then
contributed. "Yeah, I mean they weren't destroying the equipment, they
were mothballing it." </p>

<p>Giles was the next one to speak. "I guess that would explain
why such valuable equipment was being stored at a National Guard
armory. I don't suppose your military skills involve nuclear
reactors?" Xander shook his head. "Nothing beyond "Stay the hell away
and leave it to the experts."  Tara had been quiet up until that
point. "Then what do we do with it?" Buffy looked over her shoulder at
Tara, but didn't speak. Spike then grumbled. "I suppose I could move
in." They all gaped at the bleach blond vampire as he spoke. "What? I
mean if I'm going to be saddled with the lot of you I might as well do
something helpful, and the idea of taking over the nancy boy's club
house sounds good to me." Giles then spoke. "I suppose the fact it's
far better then some dank crypt, not to mention far more secure
doesn't play into it either?" Spike shrugged. "That and the fact all
this electronic crap should get me some better TV reception."</p>

<p>They all stared at him a moment as Buffy then shrugged. "All
right Spike, you got it. You keep an eye on what's left of the
Initiative." He nodded. "You think you can get the red head down here
to help me hook it all up?" Tara's eyes got wide. "Willow! Is she ok?"
Buffy smiled. "She's worried sick, but otherwise she's fine. She and
Anya are back at the mansion. Now let's get out of here." While Tara
was normally pale hearing that seemed to help some color back into her
cheeks. They all seemed to slump as the tension started to ease and
the group started out of the room Faith then smirked at Spike. "Need
any help moving?" "As long as this place has a TV and a couch I'm set,
and if not I suppose I'll just have to steal some." Buffy then spoke.
"Sppiikkkke." "What? You expect me to get a day job or something?"</p>

<p>As they made their way to the exit Xander had a thoughtful
expression. "You don't still have a thing for Buffy do you?" Spike
looked aghast. "No!" Faith looked between them. "Wait, wait a minute.
Still?" Buffy seemed to be blushing and even Spike looked like he was
about to. "There was nothing between us!" Spike then sounded hurt.
"Well now, you just make it sound cheap." Buffy looked at him wide
eyed. She then saw the vampire was grinning ever so slightly. Shoving
him she sped up her pace to walk in front of the rest of the group.
Tara was the one to explain with a slight stammer in her voice.
"Willow cast a spell and it made Buffy and Spike fall in l…love."
Faith looked at Spike and then over at Buffy, and then back at Spike.
He held his hands up and shook his head. </p>

<p>She then ran forward and grabbed Buffy around the waist and
pulled her to a halt. "Come on B. He was just teasing." She seemed to
sulk at Faith's amused tone, but she did settle back into the embrace.
"Besides, I'd like to think you love me for more then my black
leather." Buffy grinned. "No, the black leather is just a bonus."
Faith laughed and twisted Buffy around and moved in to kiss her, but
before their lips touched they both paused. They let the moment
linger, a kiss simply meant to comfort and to show affection was
becoming something more. It conveyed tenderness, devotion, all with
out hinting at the passion underneath the two of them. It was a
physical kiss that was a caress of the soul. When they broke they
looked back. Giles didn't seem to be looking but he looked back the
only way his smile could be described was that of an approving father
      </p>
<p>Xander and Spike were looking and smirking, and while Xander
seemed to blush when caught Spike's grin just grew. Tara seemed to
have shrunk off to the side, but the expressions both girls gave her
caused her to smile and give a nervous half wave. Buffy then smiled.
"All right, let's go." By this point they were near the entrance and
when Spike stepped out with them they all gave him a look. "Just got
to go grab a few things from the crypt." He then strode off and the
rest shrugged and started walking towards the mansion. All placing
their weapons back into concealment. Giles then addressed Faith.
"Faith, I was hoping to speak to you about using the mansion for your
training sessions. While my flat can be made to accommodate them the
mansion has much more available space."</p>

<p>Faith nodded. "Sounds cool G, we can even set up some bigger
gear in the courtyard if we need it. When I told Angel about me
settling back down here he began some big deal to set me up with the
mansion full time." He smiled. "Excellent." Xander then spoke to
Buffy. "I suppose you two will be shackin up some time soon huh?"
Faith seemed to look a bit scared, but Buffy looked down, and then
looked shyly at Faith. "Sounds good to me."  When Faith started
smiling Buffy then looked over at Tara and reached out to link her arm
around the shy Wiccan's waist. "I suppose I better since I'm sure Tara
has plans for my roomie already." Tara's eyes got wide and she started
shaking her head. Buffy smiled and removed her arm from the Wiccan's
waist and patted her on the shoulder. "It's ok Tara, I think it's
great." Tara smiled, but seemed unwilling to make eye contact with
anyone.</p>

<p>"Well, we, we had talked about it, but…" Buffy smiled. "Willow
didn't know how to tell me." Tara nodded and Buffy continued to smile.
"Well it's no problem now." Tara smiled and her posture seemed to
straighten a bit. Xander then spoke up to Faith from off to the side.
"Now all you have to do is meet the parents." It seemed the slayers
were truly connected because they both had similar expressions of
terror. Xander looked confused. "I can understand Faith being scared,
but why are you worried Buffy?" Before the blonde slayer could answer
she saw a hurt expression cross Faith's face. "It's understandable. I
mean "Mom? Not only have I switched sides, but I chose to go lesbo
with the psycho." Buffy shook her head. "After Angelus I'm not worried
about that. I mean she did forgive you."</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. "That's before she learns I'm getting
naked with her baby." Xander's interest seemed peeked at that, but
with only a look both girls kept him silent. Buffy then stepped close
to her partner and took her hand. "I still say that after Angel she
will probably be happy as long as you are not evil right now. My worry
is the girl in bad girl." Faith arched her brow. "Hey, she accepted
the whole slayer thing. Why would she have a problem with you goin
gay?" Buffy shook her head. "You didn't see her initial response to
throw me out of the house when she learned about it." Faith held
Buffy's hand a little tighter and hugged it to her chest. "Well you
got a place to crash with me. So there's nothing to worry about."	</p>

<p>Buffy rested her head to Faith's shoulder. "I know, but she's
still my mom." Faith's voice was quiet as she put her arm over the
shorter girl's shoulder. "I know." That moment kept the group silent
until they made their way to the edge of the mansions property, Buffy
then spoke up. "Ok, we need to get back in with out the cops noticing
us. Xander was able to make it out so he can make it in on his own
while Faith and I keep an eye on you two." Giles was offended as she
straightened his jacket. "I'll have you know I can be quite stealthy."
Buffy took her Watcher's arm and pulled him behind her. "Then it will
be that much easier for me to keep an eye on you." The rest smirked as
Faith took Tara's arm and Xander followed behind.</p>

<p>They had made it back to a darkened house, and while that
usually seemed to mean trouble everyone seemed to relax when the
slayers did. Tara then spoke. "Where's Willow?" Xander was the one to
answer her. "She's in the same room you two guys slept in last night."
With out another word she hurried off at which Faith smirked slightly.
"They both have it bad don't they?" Giles then spoke. "I believe they
have the right idea. Since everything seems to be in order I will go
get some sleep as well." Faith laughed. "G, I don't think sleeping is
what's on the menu." Giles blushed at that. "Yes, very well. I believe
I shall retire." Xander smirked. "Retire? Already? We haven't even got
your gold watch ready." Giles scowled and moved off while the rest
grinned. Xander smiled. "Still, teasing aside I think I am going to go
break down and clean these weapons and then go climb into bed with
Anya."</p>

<p>Faith smirked. "Going to be any sleeping going on there?"
Xander grinned back. "Wouldn't you like to know?" Faith seemed to
shrug. "I wouldn't mind." Buffy's eyes got wide as Xander laughed and
left. "Faith!" The girl in question smirked at Buffy. "What? Did you
got juiced seeing Action Xander?" Buffy shook her head and took
Faith's hand to guide her towards the bedroom, Faith grinning all the
while. "So is that a yes or a no?" By this time Tara had made it back
to the room she and Willow had spent the night in. She found her hand
was trembling as she reached out and turned the door knob which then
opened with a click that seemed extraordinarily loud to her, but when
the door opened she could see the bed occupant had not stirred.</p>

<p>The click upon closing the door behind her seemed even louder,
but again the bed's occupant seemed to sleep soundly. It was only when
she got close to the bed she saw Willow had not been sleeping well at
all. There was a slight redness to her eyes that seemed to say Willow
had been crying and the expression on her face said that not even
sleep had stopped her worry. Tara's hand dipped down and caressed the
warm skin of Willow's cheek and the reddened eyes opened immediately.
They blinked several seconds, but then locked on Tara as Willow sat
upright. "Tara?" Before Tara could answer Willow wrapped her arms
around her and was hugging her tightly enough to almost bruise. She
hadn't noticed the blonde's squeak as the hug was first applied, but
she did notice that Tara seemed to be squirming in her arms.</p>

<p>Pulling back she still kept contact with Tara by resting her
hands on Tara's upper arms. "Are you ok? Did Riley hurt you?" The last
part was said with more then a little anger and while Tara was nodding
Willow seemed to notice the flash of concern. "I once told Riley if he
hurt Buffy I would beat him with a shovel, and now I have two
reasons." Tara shook her head. "Y…you don't have to worry about Riley
anymore." Willow seemed to pause. "Staked?" Tara nodded again.
"Staked." "Poor Buffy." Tara shook her head. "Faith did it, and Spike
helped her." Initially Willow's hands had moved over Tara's body to
look for injuries, but when they didn't find any they continued, but
far more slowly, almost absently as they talked. While Willow didn't
seem to be thinking about it, more and more Tara wasn't able to think
about anything else, but the feel of Willow's hands on her.</p>

<p>Willow seemed to notice this and smiled, then while the smile
left she slipped close and spoke in a whisper. "I was so worried."
Tara looked away. "It's ok. I like being a Scooby." Willow smiled and
kissed the cheek closest to her. "You do?" Tara nodded, but still
looked away as Willow spoke. "That's good, because I know they like
you. "Tara looked back and started to agree with her, but Willow took
the opportunity to press their lips together. She kept the kiss going
and when Tara took a breath she slipped her tongue into Tara's mouth.
At first Tara seemed surprised, but some instinctive side of her that
wanted Willow responded to the passion in the kiss as much as her
conscious side reveled in the touch of the woman she loved. Before she
knew it her tongue was pressing back against Willow's as they both
laid down on the bed.</p>

<p>Upon waking Faith was confused, not because she didn't know
where she was but because she knew exactly where she was, and that had
never happened before. The sensations were not new in and of
themselves, lying in a warm bed, waking up with another person in the
bed with her. Of course there were subtle differences. In stead of the
smell of old sweat and sex there was just the smell of Buffy. Faith
wasn't terribly surprised, while the idea of being with Buffy had been
in her head along time by the time they had gotten back from the ruins
of the Initiative they were so exhausted all they had the energy to do
was strip, shower, and get into bed. They actually probably didn't
even have the strength to shower, but they were both coated with the
smell of sweat, demon blood and gunpowder. While the first one was
nice, the second two had to go.</p>

<p>However the differences did not end with just the sweet smell
inherent to Buffy Summers. There was also the feeling of the body
pressed up against hers. Now it was not the first time Faith had woken
up with someone else, it was not even the first time she had awakened
with someone else on top of her like Buffy was, but it was usually the
result of one or both of them passing out after sex. Buffy was
different, she was cuddled on top of Faith, as it the dark haired
slayer were a favorite pillow, or a stuffed animal, and she drew
comfort from the contact, and Faith found she did as well. The last
difference was that she did know. Normally when she woke up, alone or
with someone else she had to find her bearings, unless of course it
was her slayer senses waking her up.</p>

<p>With Buffy however, she knew, right away she knew who she was,
where she was, and who was laying with her. Perhaps it WAS her slayer
senses detecting the presence of the other slayer, or maybe it was far
simpler. Something on some instinctive level knew the smell,
recognized the warmth put off by the tiny blonde frame, the silky
softness that was yet firm and strong, just KNEW all the things that
made up Buffy and recognized them faster then her conscious mind ever
could. Of course Faith usually didn't bother much with deep
introspection and simply allowed the wide smile to cross her face when
her conscious mind realized. "I'm holding Buffy Summers, because she
loves me and I love her." Of course the fact that Buffy had not been
able to return to her dorm room yet gave Faith the sensation of
Buffy's skin against hers with no interruption. </p>

<p>She idly wondered it she could get to the room before Buffy
and hide all her pajamas. "What are you smiling about?" The voice was
sleepy, but smiling as Faith looked down and realized that she was
indeed smiling. "You." She leaned down and tenderly kissed the blondes
lips repeatedly. Buffy smiled happily. "Me too." Faith smirked.
"Smiling about yourself, guess I should not be surprised." Buffy
huffed and rolled off of Faith. With out fail the other slayer rolled
as well and ended up on top of Buffy. Buffy smirked up at her. "Just
wanted to see if you'd follow." Faith's smile vanished to be replaced
by a look that was both solemn and tender. "Always." She leaned in and
kissed Buffy again, but longer, slower, and when it broke Buffy
reached up and cupped Faith's cheek. "I love you." Faith smiled. "I
love you too."</p>

<p>Buffy then pouted and paused that caused Faith to look
confused. "Something wrong B?" Buffy looked back into her eyes. "Just
waiting for the knock on the door." Faith shrugged and laid her head
back down against Buffy's stomach, and that's how they waited, and
waited, and waited. "B, I don't think there is going to be a knock."
"You think something's wrong?" Faith sighed into Buffy's abdomen.
"That, or they are just trying to give us some privacy. Well that or
maybe Xander drilled a hole in the wall and is watching us. Buffy's
stomach muscles shook with laughter under Faith's cheek as Faith
smiled. "Still, I guess they are guests and all. So I suppose we
better look in on them." Faith seemed regretful while Buffy seemed
relived, but she did notice Faith's expression. "Sorry, guess I'm just
making you earn it." Faith paused. "Making ME earn it? Who's the one
that knocked me down and mounted me?" Buffy blushed and looked down
while muttering. "I only did that once."</p>

<p>"Whose the one who suggested we sleep together naked?" Buffy
continued to look down and Faith smirked as she gave the blonde a
playful swat on the butt. "Buffy Summers, you are as bad as I am. I
hope you know that." Buffy looked like she was about to object, but
then reconsidered and stepped close to the now half clothed Faith.
"That's just because you corrupted me." Faith gave Buffy a blank look.
"Yeah, so?" Buffy grinned as she wrapped her arms around Faith's waist
and stretched up to steal a kiss. "I hadn't said thank you." Faith
grinned back at her as she gave another kiss. "You're welcome." The
two broke apart and finished dressing, holding hands as they walked to
the living room.</p>

<p>There they found everyone except Willow and Tara. While they
all looked refreshed from a goodnight's sleep they also seemed to be
suffering from being away from home, the men showed signs of stubble
and all of them looked rumpled. Buffy looked at Faith and then at the
group. "Well, the Initiative's been shut back down… Riley's been
destroyed." They all looked sad at that point and Faith gave Buffy's
hand a squeeze as Xander spoke. "Are we just going to let Spike get
away with turning him?" Buffy looked at the floor. "Riley tried to
play with an animal and it bit him." Faith slipped her arm around
Buffy's waist. "If someone puts their hand in the kennel of an attack
dog and they get bit do you blame them or the dog?" Xander seemed to
nod reluctantly as Giles spoke. "Are we sure Spike has been muzzled
again?"</p>

<p>Faith was the one to answer that question. "Yeah and he seems
to have accepted it. He's even willing to help us out." They all
seemed skeptical as Faith grinned. "No, Giles said it best. Spike
needs protection from all the demons he's pissed off, and as long as
he has the chip they are the only things he can beat on." Faith then
seemed to blush as she spoke. "That and he's lonely. I mean the other
demons won't have anything to do with him, so he needs somebody."
Buffy's eyebrows suddenly shot up and she looked at Faith. The dark
haired slayer grinned. "He offered and I turned him down." Buffy's
mouth had set into a determined line, but Faith simply grinned as she
leaned in and kissed her. "Come on B, can you blame him? You have to
realize your dating a hottie. I mean just think about what I'm going
to have to go through. Not only will the college GUYS be after you,
but I'm willing to bet the girls will be chasing that tail once they
find out you've started swinging from both sides of the plate."</p>

<p>As Buffy blushed deeply she saw that Giles was looking
entirely uncomfortable while Xander was looking entirely TOO
interested; Anya had fallen back asleep against Xander's shoulder.
Faith noticed that and smirked at Xander. "I guess that long night of
sleeping took more out of her then we thought." Xander grinned
slightly as he looked down at his sleeping girlfriend, but before he
was able to answer two bleary eyed Wiccan's shuffled into the living
room. Faith smirked at them as well. "Ladies! Have a pleasant night?"
The pair blushed and Faith's smirk grew, but before she was able to
continue Giles spoke up. "Well, as Buffy was about to say matter has
been wrapped up and we can finally get home." As the Watcher stood and
seemed ready to leave Willow perked up. "Oh, can you give us a ride
back to the dorms?" </p>

<p>He nodded. "Are you ready?" The girls seemed to look at each
other as Willow spoke. "Just a sec, we need to go grab a few things
from our room." Xander then gently shook Anya awake. "Could we get a
ride with you too?" Giles seemed reluctant but nodded Xander noticed
the look. "Giles, I hate to say it, but you REALLY need to get a new
car. With all the damage that one has suffered one of these days the
rest of us will be fighting a demon while you are sitting on the side
of the road." Giles nodded, "I fear you are correct." Xander motioned
Anya to follow him back, but before they left he spoke over his
shoulder to Faith. "CAN I keep the military gear here?" Faith sighed
and nodded. "Yeah, yeah, just be sure it's hidden and packed safely
away."</p>

<p>Xander nodded as he and Anya walked off. Giles looked at the
girls. "There is still the matter of the police." They all sighed.
"Sleepover?" Then they all nodded. Giles sighed again. "When we leave
I will just tell the police we are getting clothing for several days."
Faith gave the Watcher a playful smirk. "What? Getting sick of me
already?" At first he did not notice the smirk, but his expression
changed when he saw Buffy give her partner a playful nudge. "Yes, well
it is not your presence as much as it is the absence of my own bed and
my own flat." Faith smiled and nodded. "Yeah, there's no place like
home, but we'll have you back in no time… Dorothy." </p>

<p>Giles looked offended, but Buffy spoke before he was able to.
"I always thought of Giles more as Auntie Em." The Englishman looked
even more offended, but this time Faith was the one to cut him off.
"Oh great, now I am going to have a bunch fantasies with you as the
role of Dorothy." Buffy looked amused. "So who would that make you?
You bathe too often to be the wicked witch." Faith stepped close to
Buffy and gave her a kiss. "I was thinking more about being the
wizard, and dragging Dorothy behind the curtain." "What curtain?" They
all turned to see Willow and Tara rejoin them and Faith answered the
question. "Oh we were just seeing which Scooby is like which character
from the Wizard of Oz." The rest of the group seemed to tense up and
look at a confused Faith and an equally confused Willow. Then Willow
seemed to realize what they were worried about.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's ok. Oz is in my past. It's not like before when it
hurt to even say his name." They all relaxed as Willow continued.
"Well, you've got two witches, but neither of us is wicked." Faith
gave both the witches a leer. "Right." They both blushed at each
other. Xander and Anya returned. "Did I hear naughty talk?" They all
through a look at Xander and he shrugged as Giles spoke. "There's our
Cowardly Lion." Xander looked both confused and offended as Buffy
stepped up and put an arm over his shoulder. "AFTER he found his
courage." He smiled, and kept smiling as Buffy dropped her arm and
spoke to everyone. "Ok, Giles brought up the point of the cops. The
fact is they don't know that the problem is taken care of. So they
expect to keep protecting us. So what we are going to do is have a
several day sleep over, but Giles is going to drive everyone to get
their clothes and stuff."</p>

<p>Willow nodded and as she spoke Tara nodded with her. "I'll go
get our homework." Xander then spoke up. "I'll be in charge of the
normal nutritional … stuff." They all smirked at him as he grinned.
Giles spoke as well. "And I will make plans to bring over the training
equipment." As the rest of the Scoobies moved off to the car they were
discussing the logistics of fitting everyone inside. When they had
heard the car sputter away Faith spoke to herself. "It can't be that
easy." Buffy looked at her curiously. "What can't?" Faith looked at
Buffy. "Forgiveness, I mean I know the road to redemption is a long
one, but this was such a big step, and it just seems to easy." Buffy
slipped behind the brunette and hugged her waist. "I don't know how
easy it was. A lot of things happened." Faith seemed ready to speak,
but Buffy just squeezed her tighter.</p>

<p>"Faith, you are NOT responsible for Riley. He is the one who
put all his insecurities on you. The only other thing you have done
was kiss me, and I hope you don't regret that." Faith smiled shyly.
"As long as you don't." She then found herself turned around in the
smaller woman's arms. "I don't. In fact, I want to do it again." They
both grinned as Buffy arched up to capture her lips and her mouth
willingly surrendered. The kiss continued and started to deepen.
Faith felt Buffy's hands move to her waist. It started as a gentle
caress, but the touches grew more insistent the longer they kissed.
Soon Buffy was clawing at the waist of her jeans. While she thought
about heading to the bedroom the couch was much closer, and Faith
couldn't wait. She allowed the smaller slayer to push her back against
the couch, and as she rested there she felt her jeans coming
unfastened.</p>

<p>Upon awakening Buffy could feel fresh, cool air over her back,
and warm flesh under her chest. She didn't even bother opening her
eyes as she nuzzled closer to the abundant chest she was resting
against. As she did so she let out a contented purr. Then she started
kissing her was up from between Faith's beautiful breasts  and to her
collarbone. The taste of Faith's sweat and their combined passion made
her swoon, and as she stretched out her muscles felt comfortably used
made her smile. It was almost enough to distract her as she bit
Faith's neck and started to suck. Not feeding like their unliving
foes, not even breaking the skin but instead just bringing the blood
to just under the surface, leaving her mark on her mate. That woke
Faith  and her hands started to scratch over Buffy's skin, both of
them purring in unison. Buffy's lips then moved up to Faith's and they
shared another long kiss, lingering traces of their passion there as
well.</p>

<p>It was then Buffy realized that she didn't feel any bed
sheets, namely because they had made love right then and there in the
living room. The strange thing was that the experience was not
cheapened by the fact, but enhanced because it meant they were unable
to contain their passion a second longer. After that realization sunk
in she realized that while they were alone now it was not going to
last, and that caused her to sit up abruptly. "Faith! We have to get
dressed!" The brunette looked like she missed the contact of the
smaller blonde body and reached her hands up to Buffy's hips to
maintain it. "Why?" "They'll be back soon. They should be back
already!" Faith shrugged, but since she was on her back it was more a
roll of her shoulders. "So? Were all adults." She then grinned rather
wickedly. "Besides Willow and Tara had sex here." Buffy looked
aggravated. 'Yes, but not in the living room, and they didn't lay
there naked, waiting for someone to walk in on them."</p>

<p>Faith grinned. "No that sounds more the style of Xander and
Anya." Buffy reached down and grabbed Faith's shoulders and sat her
up. "We'll talk about it later. Now get dressed." Buffy hopped off of
her and started looking for her clothes, which was hindered by the
fact the girls had flung them off with out too much thought about
where they would land. Faith got up as well, but she sighed as she did
so, and she too began gathering her clothes. Though by the time Buffy
had gotten dressed Faith was still effectively stripped to the waist.
She then turned and put her hands on her hips. "So B. What the hell
did you do with my top?" They both looked and then Buffy looked by the
open door to the entryway and saw that it had landed just inside. She
ran up and took it in hand, and as she heard the front door open she
tossed it back into the living room.</p>

<p>A jovial Xander was the first to enter with one hand balancing
several pizza boxes. Right behind him his girlfriend Anya had two full
grocery bags, and behind her Giles was carrying several cases of pop.
"Wow, you guys went all out." Xander grinned. "Well, a good playing
construction job combined with living in your parents basement tends
to give you a decent disposable income." Anya then spoke from behind
the brown paper. "Something that is going to change soon. RIGHT?"
Xander nodded and smiled at Anya over the ridged top. "Right after I
Go Guard we will go apartment hunting." Faith joined them then. "So
you decided to join the army?" As Faith took one of the bags from Anya
and one of the cases from Giles Buffy was glad her girlfriend was
dressed, but couldn't keep herself from remembering what she looked
like otherwise. </p>

<p>In the very back Willow and Tara squeezed into the filling
entryway, both of them laden with book bags. As they all moved towards
the living room Xander answered Faith's question. "Well I had Giles
swing by the recruitment office on our way back, and from what I
picked up I'm thinking Yo Joe!" They all smiled while Faith led Giles
and Anya to the kitchen. "Yep, I already have the skills, but like
Spike had said I need the conditioning. The easy access to military
made mayhem will help too." Buffy seemed to take a long look at
Xander. "So you're finally finding direction in your life?" He held up
his hands. "I wouldn't go that far, but I'm realizing where I don't
want to be." Willow and Tara were setting their bags down in a
semi-organized pile as the red head spoke. "Does that place include
the parent's basement?" Xander smirked. "That place IS the parent's
basement. The rest is pretty good. I mean I have a GREAT girlfriend."</p>

<p>They all grinned at him as Buffy spoke. "She's not here to
hear that you know?" Xander smiled. "I know." The doors opened as the
missing three rejoined them and Faith walked up to Buffy and gave her
a kiss. "Not here to hear what?" Buffy smiled and kissed Faith back.
"Anya wasn't here to hear Xander compliment her." Anya was already
close to Xander and looked curiously at him. "You complimented me?" He
smiled a bit shyly. "Well yeah, I was just saying that besides the
basement dwelling I have a good life. I mean I have a great
girlfriend." He punctuated that statement by kissing said girlfriend.
"I also have great friends, and while my life might not have direction
it does have purpose." Giles looked at him then. "Yes, but won't you
miss the direction others have?" Xander smirked and gave pointed looks
to Buffy, Faith, Willow, and Tara. "Ok, who would have thought Willow
would have found love with another girl?" </p>

<p>Nobody raised their hands, and that got Tara a questioning
look from Willow. "I… I hoped you would, but I never really thought it
would happen." The two shared a smile as Xander continued. "Ok, who
thought Buffy would."  Willow seemed to look slightly offended at
that. "What? So I was more likely to go gay then Buffy?" She had said
it to herself, but everyone seemed to smile at her comment as Xander
finished. "Now, not only did Buffy switch sides…" Buffy spoke then. "I
did not switch sides. I just expanded my horizons." "Whatever, my
point is not only did you do it, but you did it with your mortal
enemy. Unless of course that was just a funny bruise Faith picked up."
Buffy blushed as Faith smirked as Xander's eyes pointed right at
Faith's hickey. "So all that, and none of it planned." They all
reluctantly nodded. "So I'm happy, healthy, and I have a purpose is
life. Direction just seems like what your doing until life decides
otherwise."</p>

<p>Faith threw her hair back, which showed her hickey for all to
see and Buffy smiled at her indulgently. "Ok, enough deep talk. I mean
I agree, and I don't. If I had planned ahead a bit more I probably
wouldn't have ended up like I did, but I also know my redemption plan
didn't include any of this." Giles took off his glasses and began
cleaning them. "Well put. Now I believe Willow had some files to show
me." Willow looked surprised and then nodded. "Right." She went to one
of the bags and pulled out her laptop as she walked toward a table
Buffy followed. "Giles and a computer. Now THAT'S unplanned." Giles
threw Buffy a slight glare, which made the blonde grin. </p>

<p>"Yes, she has some files on how the control chips were
supposed to work, and I have an extensive knowledge of demon biology."
Buffy looked taken back. "What? Are you going to make a demon army?"
Giles rolled his eyes. "Of course not, but the Initiative's research
was far more advanced then we had thought, and if recent events have
shown us anything it is that they could come back and haunt us. So I
wish to make sure we have SOME familiarity with their tools." </p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "Makes sense." Faith was nodding as well. "Makes
sense for them. They do the thinking, we do the breaking. Come on B,
they rented some movies, and we all earned a break." Willow seemed to
get a slightly down look and they all noticed, but Giles was the first
to comment. "You don't need to stay here Willow. If you can show me
what to do I start the research on the biology, and then you can
instruct me on the technology after the movie." Willow smiled much
broader and her fingers seemed to speed up. </p>

<p>The Scoobies were catching their breath as the credits started
to roll. As they did Faith looked over at Xander. "Excellent movies
choice. What made "Baby Blues" stand out?" He shrugged. "Well it has
Jefferson Blue for our martial artists, and well Kathleen Turner plays
a literal pistol packin momma." Willow then chimed in. "Then there is
her ubersexy voice." Tara nodded in agreement from where she snuggled
with Willow. Xander then sighed. "Well my excellent movie taste aside
how much longer do you think we're going to have to be here?" Giles
spoke up from his position in front of the computer and in the midst
of a sea of books. </p>

<p>"I spoke with the police and they said that the military had
become involved and that Riley Finn is listed as a deserter and so
military police were taking over the investigation." Buffy looked
confused. "So we'll be getting a military guard?" Giles gave her an
admonishing look before turning back to the screen. No, it means that
the military has managed to figure out what happened and are cleaning
up the mess, which includes getting rid of the local police
interference." Xander then looked over at Giles. "Ok, that still
doesn't tell us WHEN." Giles pinched the bridge of his nose. "The
officer had said that the chief of police had extended their overtime
for the next two days, but then he mentioned a call from the governor.
So I figure they will haggle over jurisdiction for awhile, and then
probably have them called back in by midday tomorrow, or the next day
at the most. Which reminds me Buffy, I had spoke to your mother about
the situation so she would be sure not to invite Riley in."</p>

<p>A look of panic crossed her face at the Watcher's statement
and he held up a hand. "I had only told her about that development,
but you may wish to call her. I'm sure with all of the publicized
violence she has grown worried." Buffy seemed reluctant, but support
from the idea came from an unexpected source, Faith. "He's right B.
She is your mom, and even if you keep her out of the active slaying
she's your mom." Buffy looked confused. "You WANT to come out to my
mom?" Buffy could feel a slight tremble as she rested back against
Faith's chest. "WANT to? No, but… trust me on this B, she needs to
feel a part of your life." She turned around in Faith's arms. "Wait,
have you two talked?" Faith shrugged a little bit. "Well, kinda, when
I was holding her hostage, just trust me B. Talk to her." </p>

<p>Buffy seemed to want to ask her more, but she refrained, and
nodded. "All right. I guess I'll go call her." Faith looked concerned.
"Don't tell her over the phone." Buffy looked offended. "I'm not. I'm
just going to invite her over. There's a little bit of daylight, and
if worse comes to worse there should be enough left if she wants to
leave right away." While Buffy had seemed casual when saying the last
part Faith still took her hand and gave it a squeeze. She let go of it
as Buffy pulled away towards the phone, and everyone remained silent
as Buffy dialed. "Hey mom…. Yeah everyone's fine… except Riley… He was
turned into a vampire… I know, thanks… but the rest of us are safe.
Were with Faith at the mansion. Yeah, she and I have worked things
out." The entire room seemed to grin at that. "I was wondering if you
could come here too. There's something I need to talk to you about,
but I have to do it in person. Ok, love you too mom."</p>

<p>Buffy seemed several shades paler as she set the phone down.
"She's on her way." Faith had already stood up and walked over to her.
As the receiver was hung back up she pulled Buffy back to their
position cuddling on the couch. The room was silent as Faith noticed
tears forming around Buffy's eyes. "Faith? Do you think I'm going to
loose my mom?" The entire room seemed to jolt with that question as
Faith squeezed Buffy tighter. "No B, your mom is always your mom. Not
much can change that." "Yeah, but I mean Giles is more like my dad
then my dad is." The watcher seemed to smile at that inspite of the
otherwise gloomy atmosphere. "What ever happens B, you are not alone."
Giles nodded silently and made sure Buffy saw his reassuring smile.</p>

<p>Xander then smiled. "Hey, I have two parents I don't really
need. They're yours if you want them." Everyone laughed at that, but
the room again fell silent as Xander replaced the tape in the VCR. "I
hope everyone is in the mood for a little Star Trek." Only Willow
seemed actually interested as Xander defended his choice. "It's from
Deep Space Nine, and I have a feeling you will like this episode" Ten
minutes after he was proven right as Faith exclaimed. "Those two
chicks with the identical body art are going to get it on, aren't
they?" Xander shook his head. "Nothing full body, but they do share a
terrific kiss in a little bit… or so I heard." They all looked at him.
"Hey, when I saw "Rejoined" on the shelf I thought it went well with
the mood of the evening." They all rolled their eyes, but they all
continued watching., except for Giles who was still pouring through
his research, pausing only for sips of tea.</p>

<p>A short time later the two slayers were wrestling for the
remote. "Give it here Faith!" "Ah come on B, You can't tell me you
don't want to watch that kiss one more time. It's almost as good as
one of yours." The two had tumbled to the floor but continued
wrestling as their friends watched the tape run forward and back.
Suddenly the doorbell sounded and everything seemed to stop, except
the tape, which began running again at normal speed. They sat up
nervously and Faith got up and ran to the door. Her normally confident
demeanor had vanished and she was chewing her bottom lip as she opened
the front door. "Hey Mrs. Summers." It was a chorus that was repeated
as they entered the main living room and Joyce smiled back at them.
Buffy had already stood up. "Hey mom." "Buffy, you sounded worried on
the phone." Buffy nodded and took her moms hand. "I gotta talk with
ya."</p>

<p>Joyce Summers sat down heavily and looked at the two girls,
one was her baby, her little girl with the big destiny. The other
shared that destiny, and her little girl. She could see the pain on
her daughter's face as she was torn between two of the most important
people in her life, and it hurt her to see it. It was when she was
looking closer she saw the mark on Faith's neck. First she had thought
it simply a bruise, and while she didn't like seeing anyone hurt it
was something she had forced herself to become used to with her
daughter, but now she saw it was not a bruise it was a hickey. With
what she had just been told she had a good idea of where she got it.</p>

<p>"Mom, say something." "What can I say? I mean you have already
made up your mind." Buffy looked hurt. "Mom, I didn't want to hide
this. I want your support. I'm mean this is confusing enough as it is.
I need Faith in my life, but I need you too." "Oh Buffy. I'm your mom,
and I am not going to make the same mistake that I made when I learned
about you being the slayer. It's just confusing for me too." Buffy
nodded nervously, and Joyce felt the need to continue. "However I know
Faith's a good girl, and I know you are too, and I guess two slayers
are better then one. I just hope you are ready." Buffy took Faith's
hand and smiled at her. "We are." Faith smiled shyly as Buffy, and
even more so at Joyce. Joyce was smiling as well, if a bit
reluctantly.</p>

<p>The three of them stood back up and walked into the living
room where everyone looked at them nervously. Joyce shook her head.
"There's no yelling, and no one is storming out. Let's just leave it
at that. I suppose I should go." Buffy let go of Faith's hand and took
hold of her mom by the elbow. "Do you have to? I mean I'm serious when
I say I mean I want to do the mother/daughter, daughter's girlfriend
bonding." She seemed surprised but she nodded at her daughter. "Ok,
what are we doing? "Xander was the one to answer. "Well we just
finished some Star Trek and we were deciding what to watch next."
Joyce Summers sat down rather primly and then noticed how close Willow
and Tara were sitting. "You too?" The girls blushed and looked at each
other. The action caused Joyce to sigh. "Couldn't you have just all
gotten tattoos?"</p>

<p>All four girls looked hurt and Joyce sighed yet again. "No, no
I'm sorry. I just need to digest all of this." Giles stood up from the
computer and walked over to the small group. "Joyce, I know it is a
lot. I will just say that after all Buffy has done for the world it
would be inexcusable to deny her some happiness, and Faith makes her
happy." At Giles words they all looked over at the slayers and the two
girls looked uncomfortable, which caused them to move closer together
in an unconscious needing, and giving of support. Joyce noticed that,
as did everyone, but it was a revelation to her and her expression had
softened. "All I have ever wanted was for Buffy to be happy, and if
that is with Faith then… I WANT to support that. I will support that."</p>

<p>With tears in her eyes Buffy hugged her mother tightly, and
her mother returned it. "I just worry, you went from my little baby to
the chosen one, and I guess I have had trouble catching up." Buffy
pulled back to look at up. "I haven't been much help there. I mean
first I hid the slaying, and even when you found out I never really
talked to you about it." Joyce did not nod, but Buffy could tell her
mother agreed, but before the guilt was able to settle in her mom
spoke. "We've both made mistakes, and we're both sorry." They both
nodded as the group gave them space. "Now it's a matter of where we go
from here." "You're right, and there is more. For Faith and me it is
not that we are both girls, but that we are both slayers." The
expression on her mothers face grew questioning as she took a breath
to speak and Giles stepped close.</p>

<p>"Now as you know there had only been one slayer." Joyce nodded
and her expression was pained. "Another had not been called until
Buffy died." Giles nodded empathetically. "Then another slayer was
called, Kendra." Suddenly Willow's voice interrupted. "Wait, why
didn't Buffy and Kendra… you know?" Giles cleaned his glasses. "Kendra
had received proper training, and part of that training included the
ability to control her impulses." Both the girls rolled their eyes at
the Watcher as he continued. "Still, if Kendra had been more open with
her emotions she and Buffy could have formed the connection " Joyce
held up her hands "Wait, so you are telling me that the slayers are
some how destined to fall in love?" Giles shook his head.</p>

<p>"We heave learned that there was one slayer, and her power was
passed down from generation to generation, and when each died that
power passed to the next slayer. We believe that when Buffy "died…"
Joyce flinched again at the mention of her daughter's death.  "When
that happened the slayer power started to pass on, but she was brought
back before that could completely happen and the slayer power was
fractured. Some went into Faith, while some had stayed with Buffy. Now
not only does the gift of the slayer include powers like superhuman
strength, agility, healing, but it also included instinctual behaviors
like being able to recognize the undead on sight. Now when the slayer
gift shattered it included the instinctive knowledge that it was
incomplete."</p>

<p>Joyce looked horrified. "So it's controlling them?" Again
Giles shook his head. "No more then our own instinctive behaviors,
because the fact is that the two slayers quite literally share a
spirit. Literally soul mates." She seemed a bit more comfortable.
"Still, what about their own choices? I mean they can not be
controlled simply by instinct." The watcher sat down. "And they're
not. Like I had said with Kendra not being suitable personally it took
someone that Buffy could be compatible with. To give an example, Buffy
fights vampires because she wants to protect humanity, but her slayer
instincts give her additional incentive. That is the same thing with
the relationship with Buffy and Faith. The instinctual pull simply
allows them to consider someone of the same gender romantically."</p>

<p>Buffy had noticed Faith squirmed at Giles words, and when she
looked at her, which was soon followed by the rest of them looking at
her. "Umm… I've never been too picky. I mean if I was attracted to
someone I was attracted. I never worried over something like gender."
While Joyce looked uncomfortable the rest seemed to shrug it off as
Giles began again. "That simply means that in Faith's case the pull
just led her to consider Buffy, and in Buffy's case it opened her mind
to the possibility of Faith. If they had truly not wanted to be
together then they would have been able to ignore the pull. While it
would have been uncomfortable to do so being the slayer gifts a
tremendous amount of willpower and they are both willful in the first
place."</p>

<p>The girls rolled their eyes at the Watcher's comments, but
calmed down when Joyce looked at them. "So what your saying is that
they are meant to be together?" The English accent carried the
response. "Not as much MEANT to be together as well suited to be
together. While they could find happiness elsewhere I truly feel it
would not compare to what they could find together." The two girls in
question were surprised at the praise and Joyce seemed to be so as
well. "Well, who am I to argue with destiny?" She then looked at
Willow and Tara. "What about the two of you?" They both blushed and
Willow answered her. "Just a good ol fashioned "Love that dare not
speak it's name" kind of thing." Joyce Summers seemed to smile sadly.
"Oddly that I have an easier time of accepting. I always have
supported gay rights. I guess that my convictions aren't as strong
when it's my own flesh and blood."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "No mom, you just never had to deal with
it up close before, but thank you for dealing with it." Joyce shook
her head, but she smiled. "I won't say I've dealt with it entirely,
but I will. I love you Buffy, and Faith, I am willing to trust my
daughter to you." Faith's eyes got wide as she nodded silently. "I
have a feeling there is more. Maybe we should just get it all out. I
mean we have been here over four years and I barely know anything."
They all started nodding and Giles made himself comfortable. Faith got
up. "I'll go grab us some more munchies." Buffy got up. "You not
worried about…" She gave her mother a glance and Faith smiled. "No,
Mrs. S knows about my past and any details Giles gives her will just
be things she deserves to know. She's forgiven me." Joyce gave her a
smile and Faith returned it. Buffy stayed on her feet. "I'll help you
out."</p>

<p>The two girls walked into the kitchen and Buffy stepped up to
the counter. She felt Faith step up behind her and put her arms around
Buffy and hold her now trembling hands. As Faith kissed her neck she
let out a long, shuddering breath. "I didn't think things would go so
well." She could feel Faith smile against her neck. "You shouldn't be
surprised, your mom is a together lady." Buffy snuggled back into
Faith's arms. "Yeah and I have pushed that to the limit with keeping
her in the dark." Faith shook her head and placed another kiss on her
neck. "Yeah and your mom stuck her head in the sand. Again, your mom's
not blaming you. So you shouldn't either." She turned around in
Faith's arms and put her cheek to Faith's chest. "I love you." "I love
you too." "…So, I'm not your first girl?"</p>

<p>She looked up and Faith was blushing. "Nah, but you're my one
and only. You know that don't you?" Buffy smiled. "I know. I just
didn't realize you were so adventurous." An eyebrow arched high on
Faith's head. "You didn't?" That caused Buffy to blush and burrow her
face in Faith's cleavage for a second. "I probably was just a little
bit in denial." Faith kissed the top of Buffy's head. "Didn't want to
think of ol Faith as kissable huh?" Buffy looked back up and grinned
at her. "Looks like it was a good idea, because now I can't think of
much else." They both laughed at that and shared a kiss, then Faith
sighed into Buffy's mouth. "We better get back out there or Xander
will come creeping in hoping for some eye candy." Buffy arched an
eyebrow back at her girlfriend. "You've never seemed shy before."</p>

<p>Faith smiled. "I'm not, but some kisses are fun, and free, and
I don't give a damn who seems them, but sometimes the kisses are just
for you and me." Buffy nodded and pressed herself into the hug. "Have
I told you I love you lately?" Faith smiled. "About 5 minutes ago."
Buffy kissed her. "How do you ever put up with me being so
neglectful." Faith smirked and placed her hands on Buffy's bottom and
gave it a squeeze. "That firm little behind. I'll just follow it
anywhere." Buffy giggled. "Now you better follow it out to the living
room." The two gathered up all the foods they had gotten and walked
back into the living room. Buffy smiled at her mom and spoke to the
group. "Ok, what are we talking about?" Xander smiled widely at Buffy.
"We were discussing how one would have safe sex with a vampire."
Buffy's eyes got wide and Faith grinned as she sat down and pulled
Buffy into her lap.</p>

<p>"Now B are you telling me you didn't use any protection? No
crosses or holy water, nothing?" Buffy gave her partner an aggravated
glance, which earned her a grin from Faith and even a slight smile
from her mother. "It's ok Buffy. I know you're sexually active." She
then gave a pointed look to the hickey on Faith's neck and both
slayers blushed. "I just didn't realize you had started as young as
you had. Of course now a days I guess that's not TOO young." Buffy
nodded. "So is that where we are? At Angel's curse being broken?" The
rest of the group nodded, and Buffy spoke sadly. "Then the safest sex
would have been abstinence, or at least reading the wording of Angel's
curse." In a similarly sad tone she related the details of Angel's
fall, and being sent to hell.</p>

<p>Wordlessly her mother stood up, walked over to her daughter
and embraced her as she related the details of the duel that sent the
soul of Angel to hell, for the first time in their entirety. "Oh
sweetheart. If I had only known. I know you were trying to protect me,
but please, PLEASE never try to carry something like that by yourself
again." Buffy nodded against her mother's shoulder. Slowly she
released her daughter and eased her back into the arms of her
daughter's girlfriend. As Buffy settled back in Faith's arms she
seemed to slump, her considerable endurance being taxed by the emotion
of the time. So far Faith had been detached from the events, but as
she heard them start to detail that first magical moment she met Buffy
she startled to slump back herself.</p>

<p>Buffy noticed this and took hold of Faith's hands and held
them in front of her. The gesture was not lost on her mother. That and
the way that the description of her acts seemed physically painful to
Faith seemed to keep Joyce from being too shocked. When it reached the
point where her daughter shoved Faith's own knife into her own stomach
she was shocked as she stared at both of the girls. Buffy cringed
under the look and Faith squeezed her tight while kissing her temple.
The entire room seemed amazed at their actions; the girls actually
seemed to be trying to soothe each other's guilt from the dark deeds
they had committed upon each other. By the time they reached Riley and
the Initiative both girls had gone numb, and just answered questions
asked of them.</p>

<p>When the tale had been told Buffy lifter her weary eyes to her
mother. "That's it, that's my life since Sunnydale." Her mother got up
from her chair and planted a kiss on her daughter's forehead. "I knew
what you did, but I never knew what it took. I'm very, VERY proud of
you." Both Summers women seemed on the verge of tears as they embraced
again. "I love you mom." I love you too Buffy." When they broke a red
eyed mother looked at Faith. "I think we could all use some rest. Do
you have room for one more?" They all smiled at that. "You know it
Mrs. S. Namely we just pick one of the many bedrooms, drag off the
dust covers and put on some linens. I'll show you where they are."
Giles stood up.</p>

<p>"No need. I'm sure you young people could use we grow ups out
of the way." The way that Giles delivered his speech with an entirely
straight face caused everyone to grin. That included Joyce Summers as
she followed her candy-induced fling back into the dark recesses of
the house. "Giles, do you really feel that way about the two of them?"
He looked at her. "Buffy and Faith? Yes. While I have wishes for the
both of them, underneath it all I want them both to be happy, and the
simple truth is that together they are, and happiness can be all too
fleeting for me to attempt to tamper with it." "So you don't think
they'll last?"</p>

<p>Giles smiled. "I didn't say that. All I mean is that the love
they share is hard to find, and I could not attempt to destroy it and
still claim to have their best interests at heart. What about you?"
Joyce sighed. "I'm getting to know my daughter all over again, and
this time I'm not going to judge anything." Giles smiled warmly at
her. "That's good, because now you are on the inside and there is no
going back." Joyce shook her head. "She's my daughter, and I have no
intention of going back." "That's good, because there is quite the
adventure ahead."</p>
