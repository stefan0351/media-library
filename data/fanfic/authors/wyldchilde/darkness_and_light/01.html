<p>"Don't give me that look Angel!" The dark slayer paced around
Angel's office as the soul-filled eyes of the vampire followed her
from where he was sitting. "Faith, I thought you were going to finally
take responsibility for your actions. To turn your life around." "I
want to! I am."  She paused and took a deep breath. "I just can't do
that from prison. I mean look at you Angel. You've killed how many
people? A hundred, a thousand, but your out here doing good, making a
difference… I need that." He stood up but remained silent and Faith
took that as the unspoken request it was. "I'm a slayer Angel, "One
from every generation chosen to battle the forces of darkness…"hell
I'm not even "one" but I AM a slayer. I CAN stand against the
darkness."</p>

<p>Angel put a hand on her shoulder, and to his surprise she
didn't shrug it off. "For how long? Faith, I exiled myself from human
contact for over a decade after I was first cursed. It wasn't until
Whistler brought me back that I started fighting evil again." Faith
simply gave the vampire a grin and he fought one from appearing on his
face. "Like I did for you…" She nodded slowly. "Angel, I was hiding
too. Hiding behind the tough girl image, and when I couldn't hide from
someone I pushed them away. Well there is no way to hide in a slate
gray cell." Angel closed his eyes and opened them. "That's when you
decided to recant your confession?" Faith nodded. "Between Wilkins and
the general cluelessness of the cops when dealing with the
supernatural there was not enough evidence to convict me."</p>

<p>"So you get away with murder?" Faith turned angrily. "How many
have you gotten away with? Maybe I should go waste a couple hundred
more people first huh? Or maybe just kill a gypsy?" Angel grit his
teeth. "I'm being punished in ways you can not even imagine." She
stepped right up to him. "Yeah, but you also have something I don't!
You have a shot at redemption! I'm not going to find it staring at the
world through a set of bars!" The vampire's undying stare didn't blink
as he looked at her. "Faith, I've been alive over two centuries and I
still have to fight not to give in to the darkness." She didn't step
back, but she allowed her posture to soften. "You're also immortal two
hundred years, or two thousand unless you end up on the wrong end of a
stake you'll be around. Slayers are anything but immortal Angel. The
only reason I'm here is because Buffy died!"</p>

<p>A naked looked of pain crossed the vampires features, but it
vanished immediately. "Angel, my slayer powers were able to keep me
safe in jail, but how long would that last? One inmate getting a lucky
shot and the next slayer is gets called. The same thing could happen
with a lucky demon, but at least I will be out there, doing what I was
made to do, and helping people as I do it." While it was unnecessary
Angel took a deep breath as he looked into Faith's eyes, and there he
saw a person very few people have seen. He saw who Faith could have
been if she had been raised better, he saw the woman Faith could have
been if someone had given her a chance. For Angel it was almost like
seeing Buffy, a dark reflection of Sunnydale's slayer, but a
reflection none the less.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" Faith's head dropped and she ran a hand
through her hair. "Well Buffy went to all the trouble to travel here.
I suppose I should return the favor." Angel's concern was blatant but
Faith seemed to realize that it was for her. "Is that wise." Faith
shrugged. "Kind of hard to repent for hurting people if you're not
willing to face them. I don't want to open any wounds for them, but I
want to let them know it's over. Give them that closure." The gaze of
the vampire never flickered and Faith let out a laugh that seemed just
short of a sob. "Thinking of others, has to be a good step huh?"
Angel's expression softened. "Yes, it is." "Thanks for picking me up
at the jail. I'll get out of your hair." Angel touched her elbow. "In
the morning."</p>

<p>She stared at his hand on her elbow, and then back up at his
face and nodded once. He took his hand away and led her further back
into the office. When they reached a couch Angel stopped. Wordlessly
she lay down on the couch, but before she was able to get comfortable
she felt Angel drape a blanket over her. "Sweet dreams." Faith got
comfortable. "For once I think that may actually happen." As he
silently closed the door behind him he returned to the front area of
the office. As he did he ran into Wesley, the former Watcher's eyes
looking back where he came. "How is she?" Wesley was already speaking
in hushed tones, and Angel did as well. "Sleeping, she's going back to
Sunnydale in the morning." Angel saw the concern on Wesley's face. </p>

<p>"She's going there to make amends." The concern never
faltered. "Still, do you think that safe? I doubt the other slayer's
feelings have changed. No matter how Faith's have." Angel shook his
head. "She's always been able to take care of herself physically, it's
her soul that needs taking care of, and that's why she needs to go.
I'm just going to get her some expense money. Have you seen the check
book?" "I believe Cordelia took it with her on vacation." Angel looked
at the Watcher aghast as the man grinned. They both chuckled as they
looked around the office. The former watcher sighed. "Do you believe
she will be successful?" Angel blinked. "I think she already has." At
the look of confusion Angel continued. "The fact she trying is what
counts."</p>

<p>Wesley nodded as Angel kept speaking. "Though it will be
easier if she can find the forgiveness she seeks." Both men seemed to
grow frustrated at their inability to find the checkbook as the door
leading father back into the office opened. They booth looked up as a
sleepy eyed Faith stepped through. "Hey Wes… how's the arm?" Wesley
smiled at her. "Fine, I don't even notice it any more." She returned a
faint smile. "So what are you guys looking for?" Both men looked
shamed as Angel spoke. "We can't find the checkbook." She looked at
both of the men for several seconds as she then walked over to the
chair Angel had dropped his jacket over. Even the vampire seemed to
blush as she handed it over. "What do you need it for anyway?"</p>

<p>Angel paused as if reluctant to speak. "I'm going to give you
some traveling expenses." She seemed ready to speak but he cut her
off. "Faith, you think I like taking money to help people? You can't
eat good intentions. Now if this money can help someone else it's
worth it. Let me help you." Angel's words up until that point didn't
seem to effect her, but when he asked her to let him help her she
dropped her shoulders and nodded. While he had allowed himself to be
shunted to the side Wesley spoke up again. "If you don't mind me
saying you look as if you could use several more hours of sleep, and
it is still awhile before morning." Faith nodded. "Thanks Wes… Angel."
Wesley stepped close to her. "When I was your watcher there were
numerous rules about keeping an emotional detachment, but I am no
longer a watcher, so I can say this. I believe in you Faith."</p>

<p>She started blinking rapidly, and they all knew it was to keep
the tears from spilling out. "Thanks… I'm going to head back to the
couch." Both men nodded and wished her goodnight as she disappeared
back into the office. Angel wrote out the check and tore it free. He
then tucked the checkbook into a desk drawer and picked up his coat.
"Will you be going with her?" Angel shook his head. "This is the kind
of thing she has to do herself. Though I am going to see if she will
stay at the mansion and I'll make sure she can call us if she needs
anything." Wesley again looked worried. "Do you think they will try to
hurt her." Angel shrugged. "It's possible, but I just want to make
sure she has someone to talk to." As Angel walked out the door he was
left alone and with out even thinking about it he turned back into the
office.</p>

<p>As quiet as he was able he opened the door into the room he
knew held the sleeping slayer. Though when he opened the door he saw
anything but the scourge of darkness. He saw a young girl, hurting,
frightened, but no longer alone, because while he could see the tear
tracks on her cheeks he also saw that she was sleeping soundly. He
thought it was almost a half-hour he stood there simply watching, but
the tough almost made him want to laugh. Watching, while he knew the
full extent of Faith's fate was not his fault he knew he bore part of
the blame because he was so content to merely watch. To follow the
rules and regulations of some antiquated council while he sent a young
girl out to kill or die. He closed his eyes tightly, thinking that he
too may cry, but instead he whispered. "I'm sorry too." Just as
silently he slipped from the office and did not hear another whisper
that was soft, but laden with fresh tears. "It's ok."</p>

<p>Riley Finn massaged his forehead as he examined the petite
form of his girlfriend Buffy Summers. While most could see how
energetic in how they walked through Sunnydale they couldn't conceive
the power held in the blonde's tiny frame. "Well Angel is over two
hundred years old. He should know what he's doing." She stopped and
put her hands on her hips. "Don't tell me your siding with him now?"
He held up his hands. "I'm just saying that from the information
Willow got she was released into his custody. He'll take care of her."
An odd look crossed Buffy's face and Riley stepped close to her. "Your
not jealous are you?" She looked offended. "Jealous? What do I have to
be jealous about?" He looked at the ground. "Well you and Angel… I
mean it is another girl, a slayer no less."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped and pulled Riley's chin up. "Riley, I'm over
Angel. I'm with you. Do you know what I told him? I said that what we
have is not what he and I had. It's very new. You know what makes it
new? I trust you. I know you." He smiled at that, and she smiled back,
but her expression darkened. "It's Faith. I mean she's getting away
with murder." He seemed to chuckle. "Well so is Angel." When he saw
her expression darken he realized he had said the wrong thing. "I
thought we had went over this with Oz. Things happened that Angel had
no control over." Riley wondered where it was coming from, but he
found himself defending Faith. "Yeah, but at least Faith's human." She
started walking again, and he was forced to break into a trot to keep
up. "I'm just talking degrees of evil, neither one of them are
saints."</p>

<p>She stopped. "Yeah, but like you said Faith's human. I mean I
tried to reach her Riley, I really did, but she wouldn't open up to
me. Angel comes along and she's crying in his arms! What does he have
that I don't?" "I guess it takes a killer to understand a killer." She
turned and looked at him. "What? So I'm too good for her?" He grinned.
"Well, you are." She smiled and swatted him in the arm. "No, I guess I
just mean that Angel's been there. I mean she knew he wouldn't judge
her." Buffy's voice softened. "Like I did." He seemed ready to
contradict her, but she interrupted him. "I WAS there Riley. I had to
walk in her shoes." He looked down again. "I remember." She absently
rubbed his forearm with her palm as she continued to speak softly. "I
just reached the point I couldn't let her keep hurting me."</p>

<p>He nodded. "Sometimes people just don't want to be helped and
you have to give up on them. I mean you were just trying to protect
yourself." "That's all Faith was doing." The two jumped as a third
voice spoke up. Angel stepped into the light and both glared at the
vampire. Buffy was the first to speak. "Well that, and all the
killing." Angel looked her directly in the eyes. "Yeah, it's scary
what a person is capable of when they think they have no other
choice." Riley saw the effect the vampire's words had on his
girlfriend. "What? Like not only drinking the blood of someone they
SUPPOSEDLY loved, but drinking nearly enough to kill them?" While
Angel had a nearly preternatural calm that managed to get through to
him.</p>

<p>"That was between Buffy and me. It doesn't involve you soldier
boy." Riley seemed almost eager as he stepped forward with his fists
clenched, and even Angel had a dangerous glint in his eye as Buffy
stepped between them. "No Riley, he's right. What ever happened
between me and Angel is in the past." Buffy was facing towards Riley
and away from Angel so she didn't see the look of hurt that crossed
Angel's ageless face. She put her hands on the soldier's forearms.
"Riley, it's you I'm with. I love you, have faith in that." The tender
expression on the petite blonde's features hardened as she turned
around. "I got out of your city Angel, now what are you doing in
mine?" "She's coming, tomorrow." The already cool expression on
Buffy's face hardened as she stared down Angel.</p>

<p>"So not only do you let her loose, but you let her loose on
US?" Angel shook his head as he stepped closer. Riley Finn was about
to step to intercept him but Buffy laid a hand back on his with out
ever taking her eyes from Angel as he spoke. "She's not here to hurt
you Buffy. She's here to help you." He continued as Buffy scoffed.
"Not with slaying. She wants to apologize, and then she will go." Her
eyes seem to snap at him before her voice did. "What? To find another
batch of victims?" Instead of snapping back Angel's eyes met her with
determination. "Buffy, all the things I did and you never held it
against me. Even when I did them to you." </p>

<p>While her face remained locked a careful observer could notice
a softening in her eyes and he took the opportunity to continue.
"Buffy, Faith is not asking you to trust her, or like her. She's not
asking you to do anything at all. She's just going to apologize. You
don't have to accept it. You don't even have to listen if you don't
want to. SHE wanted to try. She was the one who suggested coming back
here." Buffy's voice was still firm, but it didn't seem as sharp. "Was
she the one who got you to come down here and try to pave the way for
her?" Angel shook his head. "She doesn't even know I'm here. I just
thought I'd offer to let her stay at the mansion as long as she is
here, but I wanted to make it ready first. Running into you was just a
coincidence."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded sternly. "I was in LA a day, but I'll give her
three, and she stays at the mansion so I can keep an eye on her."
Angel looked saddened and nodded, but as he turned away her spoke.
"That's a lot of hate inside you Buffy. Now just try to imagine a
lifetimes worth." As he walked from view Buffy's posture was still
tensed, but as close as he was standing to her he detected a slight
tremble, and while Angel was too far away to see it the hard
expression was now confused and hurting. "Buffy?" "I am NOT like her."
She almost seemed in shock as Riley gently turned her to face him. "Of
course your not." "I'm not." "Buffy, you are NOTHING like her. You are
a strong, confident woman surrounded by people who love you."</p>

<p>While his words were meant to comfort they only seemed to
confuse and he put his arm around her waist. "Come on, let's get you
back to your dorm. We can cut patrolling short tonight." As they
walked he ran his hand in comforting circles on her back. "Come on
Buffy. This is what Faith feeds on. If you are going to be ready for
her you can't play her game." She looked up rather sharply. "Angel
said she was just here to say she's sorry." Riley shook his head. "I
guess she's better at playing people then we thought." She shook her
head, but the movement seemed wooden. And Riley continued. "Come
Buffy. It's perfect. She knows there is not case against her so she
makes a confession. Then after everyone thinks she's really going to
go through with it she recants it and gets set free to "make amends".
It all fits."</p>

<p>She shook her head again and he continued to speak. "Ok, my
feelings about Angel aside… if you loved him then he must be one of
the good guys. Faith knows that, and she played on it. I mean you said
it yourself." A look of horror crossed her face as she looked at him,
and it left him looking confused. She then took up a walk that was
just short of a run. "I… I gotta go." Before he could reply Buffy had
made it to her dorm room and slammed the door. While it made him
flinch on the outside of the door. It made her roommate jump, though
not bad enough for her to loose her pace in the book she was reading.
"Buffy? Buffy, are you all right?" All she could do was shake her head
no as she sat down on the edge of her bed. "It's Faith."</p>

<p>At the mention of the dark slayer the redhead got up and
whirled around as if she expected Faith to come crashing through a
window or materialize out of thin air. "She's not here, not yet."
Concern warred with confusion as Willow sat down next to Buffy. "It's
ok Buffy, well call Xander and Giles and well be ready for what ever
she's planning." Buffy shook her head. "She's not planning anything."
Skeptical would be a polite description of Willow's expression upon
hearing that. "Says who?" "Angel." "Oh." They both sat silently for
several minutes until Willow broke the silence. "Then what is she
coming here for?" Buffy took a deep breath. "To say she's sorry." At
that point simply skeptical described Willow as she looked at Buffy,
and Buffy nodded. "I know, I know. I can't believe it either, but I
mean how can I say no?"</p>

<p>"Like this…" Willow took a breath to speak, but didn't when
Buffy rolled her eyes. "Will, if she want to turn her life around… how
can I deny that too her. I mean look at me, when I ran away you guys
took me back. I had to work to regain your trust, but I had the
chance." Even though it was an exclamation Willow spoke softly.
"Buffy! You didn't kill anybody!" Buffy looked mournful. "I killed
Angel." "You didn't kill him. He's here, he's alive." A stray tear ran
down Buffy's cheek. "Ok, I sent him to hell. Is this supposed to make
me feel better?" The familiar site of Willow's "resolve face" greeted
Buffy Summers. "Buffy, either Angel went to hell, or the world did,
and he still made it back." "Yeah, but he went to hell and got a
second chance, what kind of monster would I be to deny a second chance
to Faith."</p>

<p>Willow sighed. "You'd be a realistic one Buffy. She's a
talented liar, I mean at one point she had us convinced she was you."
Buffy grinned. "Well having my body had to help her." Willow grinned
as well. "To be fair that helped her story." The two smiled, Willow
Rosenberg again took on breaking the silence. "So do you know what you
want to do?" The light slayer took a deep breath. "I told Angel she
had three days, and that she had to stay at the mansion so that I
could keep an eye on her." Willow again had her "resolve face" on. "So
that we can keep an eye on her." Buffy couldn't help but smile at her
friend's unconditional support when Willow spoke again. "Do we know
when she's getting here?" Buffy's eyes were down cast. "Tomorrow."</p>

<p>"It's not a lot of time to get ready, but we'll do it." Buffy
didn't lift her head, but she did smile. Willow's eyes looked sad for
her friend. "If she is telling the truth, will your be able to forgive
her?" Buffy fell backwards onto the bed. "That's the question isn't
it? I mean I want to, but I'm scared." "Scared?" Buffy nodded.
"Scared, I mean I'm the slayer, things try to kill me all the time,
but Faith's different. I let her in. It's almost like when Angel
turned, but… in LA she pleaded with me she just wanted to know how to
make it better." Willow slid back on the bed so she was sitting near
Buffy's shoulders. "What did you say?" Buffy sighed. "I didn't say
anything, I didn't get a chance. A council guy picked that moment to
come in shooting." "So you believe her?"</p>

<p>Buffy closed her eyes tightly. "I don't know Will, I believed
her then, but I don't know about now. I want to. I'm at least going to
listen." Willow then nodded. "I will too." Buffy opened one eye and
smiled up at Willow. She then opened the other and sat up, pulling the
redheaded hacker into a hug. "Ok, lets call Xander and Giles and let
them know. We can also meet at Giles house in the morning to go over
details. Willow nodded and got up to use the phone.</p>

<p>Faith had many reasons for staking vampires. It was her duty;
it was her nature, and the fact it was a rush to pit herself against
them in mortal combat. It was however the first time she wanted to
stake one for being so damn nice to her. While she had no intention of
actually staking Angel the fact that he drove to Sunnydale, prepared
the mansion, made a bank withdrawal, and even went shopping for her
just blew her away. Humans weren't this nice to her, yet here was a
blood drinking creature of the night doing everything he could think
of to give her a second chance at life. Faith realized this was one of
the first things she had to learn. That it's one thing to be self
reliant, and another thing to cut yourself off from others.</p>

<p>She found his kindness reaffirming some belief in the kindness
of others. She also was glad it was Angel she was dealing with. Of all
those she mad met since coming to Sunnydale he seemed the only one
with any taste in clothes, and it showed in the clothes he picked up
for her. Now she was standing there in the front area of Angel
Investigations as Angel and Wesley were fussing over her before she
left. Angel was his normally stoic self, with only the lightest touch
of warmth in his eyes, but for Faith it was obvious enough. Wesley on
the other hand was fussing over her like a father whose daughter was
leaving for college. While she wasn't headed for college, as least not
in the typical sense, she was restarting her life. The presence of the
two men seemed fitting some how.</p>

<p>She had a father figure, and a FAR older brother, and the fact
they were there to see her off made her smile, even as she tried to
hide it under her normally detached expression. Angel spoke. "Ready?"
Faith took a deep breath, paused, and then nodded. "Yeah, I'll just
head down to the bus station…" Both men's expressions looked like they
were about to disagree and Faith stopped. Wesley spoke next. "Since
the sun is out Angel will not be able to accompany you, but I would
like to drive you to Sunnydale if I may." She couldn't keep the smile
from her face, but she did keep it shy. "Are you sure Wes? I mean I
honestly don't mind taking the bus." Wesley simply smiled. "It's not
that long of a trip, and I think we would both enjoy the company."</p>

<p>The two stepped from Angel's office and into the rays of dawn.
She looked into the vampire's face as he stood in the shade of the
entryway. "Thanks Angel, Goodbye." He smiled back at her. "Good luck."
She smiled and turned to Wesley as they climbed into the car and he
started the engine. From that point on the engine was the only sound,
both of the people seeming caught up in their own thoughts. At least
until Faith expressed one of those thoughts. "Wesley, I woke up when
you looked in on me." The former watcher seemed to start stuttering
out an apology but fell silent when she smiled sadly. "It's ok. I just
want to let you know I hold nothing against you, not any more. If I
want to earn the forgiveness of others I have to be willing to forgive
them, and I know all about being raised one way and thinking that was
the only way things were done."</p>

<p>He nodded sadly as she continued. "So don't let it bother you
any more. Ok?" He gave her a glance. "I don't think it's that easy.
While I thank you for your forgiveness I don't think I can forgive
myself, but that's good in a way. It's what led me to agree with
Angel's decision to help you, and I hope the memory of how I failed
you will cause me to go the distance to help others." She blinked at
him several times. "Well know that I'm not holding anything against
you." He smiled and chuckled softly. "Noted." The two lapsed into
silence again, but it was a far more comfortable kind and it remained
until they saw the sign announcing they were entering Sunnydale.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" Faith laughed nervously as she seemed to
focus on remembering to breathe. "Not really, but I'll think of
something." Wesley smiled and laid a free hand on her shoulder.
"Remember Faith, I believe in you, Angel believes in you." She nodded
and swallowed as they entered town and Wesley directed the car to
Angel's mansion. As they pulled up Faith's heart skipped a beat,
though to her it felt like it stopped when she saw the all too
familiar form sitting outside waiting. Wesley's face seemed to harden
when he saw Buffy Summers, and if Faith didn't know better it looked
as if he were ready to fight the small blonde slayer for her. The
hostile expression and body language remained as he got out of the car
and was mirrored as Buffy stood up.</p>

<p>It actually left Faith feeling odd, being the calm one, but it
also let her know that she needed to do this. It was almost as if her
anger was some infectious disease that she passed on to anyone who
came near her. Buffy strode up to them. "I thought you were coming
alone Faith." Wesley was the one to answer. "I thought she had been
alone enough already and offered to drive her here." It was then Buffy
seemed to fully acknowledge the presence of the one time watcher.
Buffy tilted her head. "I thought you didn't get involved. Isn't that
against policy?" He took an angry breath to reply, but Faith seemed to
realize she had to head it off before either gained any steam. "Thanks
for driving me Wes. I'll just grab my stuff and you can get going."</p>

<p>Both Buffy and Wesley seemed stunned, but the spell broke and
he helped her while Buffy stood watch over the two of them. As they
settled her few bags into the main living area he smiled and stepped
close to her, ignoring the slayer watching them both. "You can do this
Faith. Take care of yourself and never be afraid to call on me for
help." Faith actually blushed and nodded, which caused then her former
watcher to smile fondly. He then turned and walked out. When Faith
turned to look at Buffy she could see confusion all over Buffy's face.
Faith's gaze seemed to break into Buffy's thoughts and she focused on
Faith once more, the hard expression slipping back like it had never
left. "Don't worry B. Three days and I'm gone." </p>

<p>Buffy's expression never wavered, but she seemed to need to
steel herself. "That's right. Three days and I want you gone." Faith
nodded. "You're the boss. I can try to make it two if you would want
me to just apologize to them all at once." Buffy glared back as she
responded. "Again with the attitude!" Faith's eyes flickered. "Yours
or mine?" As Buffy seemed about to snap back a reply Faith sighed.
"I'm sorry B. That's the whole problem, your attitude, mine, mostly
mine. You didn't have to let me come here at all. Thank you for that."
The look of anger on Buffy's face vanished and now she looked as if
she had been slapped. Her eyes wide and disbelieving and locked on
Faith. "All right, your welcome." Faith kept her eyes on the ground as
she spoke again. "I did mean that earlier. I can be out of your hair
faster if you just want to call a Scooby meeting. I figure I can
apologize there, swing by and tell your mom I'm sorry, and be out by
the next morning."</p>

<p>She nodded. "That's probably for the best. I don't know if
they would want to be alone with you." The words stung Faith, and to
her surprise Buffy felt a pang of regret at that. "We were already
going to meet at Giles house at noon, why don't you come by at one?"
Faith nodded and when she looked up she found the other slayer staring
at her. "What?" Buffy seemed startled. "Nothing." She then turned
around and walked out. Faith rolled shoulders that had become
uncomfortably tight and started unpacking. Though she didn't unpack
much as she expected she could be leaving in the morning. Part of her
wanted to lay down and take a nap, but instead she found herself
moving in front of the fireplace and making herself a cleared area.</p>

<p>Slowly she took up the few Tai Chi maneuvers Angel had taught
her before she had left that morning. He always said it helped him to
focus and right now that was exactly what she needed. As she carried
out the slow moving motions she found that the moving meditation was
also a fine work out. Not like her sparring sessions with B, but good.
Unknown to her another person was recalling those training sessions as
they watched her. Buffy probably knew the mansion as well as Angel did
and was easily able to find a spot that allowed her to watch Faith
unobserved. She told herself it was to see if she did anything
suspicious once she thought that she was alone, but all she did was
that slow motion martial art Angel liked to do.</p>

<p>Five minutes turned into ten, ten minutes turned into fifteen
and as Buffy watched she forgot why she was watching. Instead of
looking for something suspicious she was remembering a time before
they were ever suspicious of each other. She remembered patrolling
together, and training together. Still it was more then that, Faith
was not just another slayer, she was Buffy's age, and unlike Kendra
she really was Buffy's age instead of just being similar in years. Her
anger had faded and Buffy almost wanted to cry, this is what she had
hoped for. This was what she wanted when Faith came out of her coma.
Then so many things happened and Buffy got so angry, but she also got
to see the world through Faith's eyes. She forgave Faith when they
were in the hospital together, now she wondered if she could do it
again.</p>

<p>Her reverie was broken as Faith stopped but it wasn't until
Faith grabbed a towel and headed towards the shower that she was able
to think again. It was then that she realized that she had spent an
hour watching the other slayer. Shaking her head she realized she
would have to break into an all out run in order to get to Giles
house, and even then she was probably going to be late. Her head
jerked up as she heard the shower turn on and she took that as her cue
that she could start running with out being overheard. She forced her
mind from thinking about Faith to thinking about what the rest were
going to think about Faith.</p>

<p>"What? Did Angel at least set her up with one of those ankle
band things?" While some of the people in the room might have agreed
with Xander's exclamation they still rolled their eyes.  Buffy was one
of them as she spoke. "Sorry Xander, but Vampire Slayer was not on the
prison work release program." He was already pacing as most sat and he
stepped close to Buffy. "Then what is she doing out? I mean HOW many
people has she killed? How many times has she tried to kill us?"
Everyone was surprised as Willow spoke up. "But she didn't. I mean if
she's such a killer you would think she could have gotten one of us."
Xander looked shock. "So what? Were working on the idea her luck's not
going to improve?"</p>

<p>Tara seemed content to stay quiet, but the way Willow was
squeezing her hand made her want to speak. "What if she's telling the
truth?" Xander scoffed. "Mutually exclusive concepts." The cultured
tones of the former librarian Giles interrupted. "Then we will listen
to what she has to say." Buffy clasped her hands together. "Then she's
on the first bus out of town and out of our lives." Giles took a
breath as she turned to face Buffy. "You may want to reconsider that.
Our encounter with the first slayer seemed to say that your slayer
abilities might be developing further. That may apply to Faith as well
and I don't like the idea of her having to puzzle them out on her
own." Xander spoke up once more. "Well I don't like the idea of the
psycho slayer getting any more powerful at all!"</p>

<p>Giles looked dubious. "Well unless one of us is willing to
kill her I don't see any options." Everyone looked around until all
eyes were on Buffy, and the scrutiny caused the fair-haired slayer to
look guilty. "Ok, killing her is not an option… and if she really
wants to set things right I want to help her. If it does turn out that
this is all a set up it's probably better if I'm able to keep an eye
on her. I mean I doubt there is a jail that could hold her if she set
her mind to it." Willow seems to stare off into space as she spoke
again. "There's also the caged slayer thing." They all looked at her
and she blushed under the scrutiny. "Well, I mean not only can't she
hunt monsters but they could hunt her." Buffy looked shocked as if
that was a point she had not considered.</p>

<p>Xander looked around the room, except for a silent Riley Finn
and Anya he looked appalled. "So what? Just blood under the bridge?
Well you were a psycho killer before, but that's ok now?" They all
stared at him. "Fine, don't mind me. I'll just go barricade myself in
the basement." As he sank down on the couch Anya snuggled up to him.
"That sounds like a good idea. We will be able to have sex with out
any interruptions." The rest of the room stared at the couple as Buffy
spoke. "Not quite yet Xander. Faith should be here soon. It's like a
band aid, just five seconds of pain." Xander sank down further into
the couch. "Followed by five hours of agony." She wanted to be mad,
but even Xander didn't seem angry. It was just one of his tantrums and
Buffy responded like she usually did, with a roll of her eyes.</p>

<p>"So we listen to what she has to say, and then invite her to
stay in town?" Each seemed to register their vote with their eyes, but
left the decision in Buffy's hands. "Ok, ok we let her say her peace.
Then we tell her that we'd like her to stay." Her tone was firm and it
showed her mind was made up, but she still scanned the room. Willow
smiled at her, and while Tara seemed to be following Willow's lead she
was smiling as well. Giles smile was subtle, but his approval was
obvious to Buffy. Riley would barely meet her eyes while Anya didn't
seem to care. When she reached Xander he was unwilling to look her in
the eye, but the stubborn set to his jaw forced Buffy to suppress a
sigh.</p>

<p>The group seemed to stew for several minutes until a timid
knock was heard at the door. Buffy was the one to answer it, and was
actually able to muster a smile when she saw Faith there. While
Buffy's smile was unsure it caused a shy smile to appear on Faith's
face as Buffy gestured for Faith to enter. While her head stayed down
as she walked in it looked up resolutely as she took a breath to
speak. "I don't want to make this any more painful for you guys. So
I'll say what I came here to say, listen to what you want to say to
me, and then I'll go." While she swallowed nervously she was speaking
again before any would have a chance to reply. </p>

<p>"I know sorry doesn't cut it, and I can't take away the pain I
caused, but I can take responsibility for it, and I can say I don't
want you guys to have to carry it around anymore. You can feel free to
hate me, but you don't have to fear me." The remainder of her breath
left her in a rush and it seemed the groups signal to speak. Giles was
the first. "What will you do now?" Faith shrugged. "Slay, do what I
was born to do, but give back to the world instead of taking from it."
"You could do that here." Brown eyes opened wide and scanned the room
and except for the stony silence coming from Riley Finn and the
disinterest of the former demon Anya the only hostility she was from
Xander Harris. What shocked her was that not only did the faces not
seem hostile, but they actually seemed supportive, unsure, but
supportive. </p>

<p>Giles took a step closer. "While slayers traditionally work
alone, they have had the guidance of a watcher, and while I may no
longer be one officially I couldn't allow a slayer to face the world
alone." She seemed to step away. "It's cool. I've been able to take
care of myself." Giles nodded sadly. "Look where it's gotten you."
When he saw pain flash across her face he stopped. "Just please
consider my offer. You don't have to stay, but I have spoken with
Buffy and she has agreed to let you stay if you choose to." Faith
turned to face the face of Buffy Summers who was at that moment trying
to sink into the background. "Is that true B?"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded slowly. "You're a slayer. You could do good on
your own, but you could do even more good if Giles is there for you."
Faith slowly panned the room and her gaze next settled on the paired
Wiccans. "You ok with this Red?" Willow nodded, as Tara seemed to be
trying to fold herself up in the couch. "If Buffy is willing to trust
you then I will too." Faith then looked directly as Tara. "What about
you?" Tara seemed startled. "M…me?" Faith nodded silently. "I trust
Willow." The way that sentence had come out with out a stutter made
Faith smirk, but when it caused Willow to place a protective hand on
Tara's knee the smirk softened to a smile and Faith spoke. "I'm glad
you can. Trust is a rare commodity."</p>

<p>When she looked at Riley he gave a noncommittal shrug.
"Buffy's the slayer. I'm not." When Faith's eyes finally met the eyes
of Xander Anya spoke up. "I really don't care to be quite honest."
Faith shrugged and nodded. "I don't really think we tangled anyway."
Then all eyes fell on Alexander Harris as he spoke. "Sorry to spoil
the love in, but one thing slipped by. Why Faith? Why did you do it? I
understand the rest of us were just Buffy's weak spots to you, but why
have you been so focused on hurting her?" The room's eyes swung to
Faith, except for Buffy who was stepping into the way until Xander
intercepted her. "Come on Buffy, if she really wants to change then
she can answer the question. Come on Faith, was it because she had the
friends, the watcher, or just because she was prettier then you."</p>

<p>That caused even the stony expression of Riley's face to look
shocked as Buffy again tried to interfere. "That's enough Xander!"
"No, no it's not. Why Faith? Why did you help a guy turn into a demon?
Why did you try to poison Angel? Why did you steal Buffy's body? Why
do you hate her so much?" Xander was shouting as he finished but as he
stopped all eyes again fell to Faith, but she was only looking at
Buffy, tears silently sliding down her cheeks. "I don't hate her. I
never have. I love her. I loved her ever since that alley outside the
Bronze, but instead of letting that love lift me up I tried to use it
to drag her down." The dark slayer's words sucked the air out of the
room so that not even the regular sounds of people breathing were
there, only the sounds of Faith walking quickly to and out the door.</p>

<p>The sound of the door shutting broke the spell that the room
was under. Buffy immediately then made her way to the door. She was
stopped by Riley's hand on her shoulder. "Buffy?" Her eyes were dazed
even as she focused on her boyfriend. "I, I have to talk to her."
Xander stood up. "That's gotta be what she wants!" "She wants Buffy
all right." Everyone turned to look at Anya. She seemed a bit
surprised at the scrutiny. "I was a vengeance demon, I know all about
the woman scorned and Faith has all the signs." Buffy shook her head.
"I didn't know." Xander spoke. "That doesn't justify what she's done!"
Giles spoke quietly. "She never said it did." </p>

<p>Xander shook his head. "It must be something about the
Hellmouth." While he wasn't even looking at Willow or Tara the redhead
gasped and the blonde's expression was blatantly hurt. Willow stood up
and turned Xander to face her. "What's that supposed to mean?" Xander
tried to shy away. "Nothing Will. I mean I'm glad you're happy." She
was up in his face as she replied. "I am Xander! For the first time
since Oz left I am happy, but that's not the issue is it? Not my
happiness, or Buffy's. You attacked every guy from Angel to Riley."
Xander's eyes rolled. "The souled vampire and the storm trooper. I'm
just keeping an eye on her." Willow rolled her eyes. "What about Oz?
He was everyone's friend and just ran into a werewolf, but you acted
like he signed on!"</p>

<p>He stepped away. "Yeah and then when he learned you had
someone new in your life he wolfed out and attacked her." Willow threw
her hands up. "At least he had his curse as an excuse! He also finally
understood that Tara makes me happy." Off to the side Tara was
blushing furiously but smiling just as much as Willow continued. "Do
you know what's the sad thing Xander. It's not the fact that we are
both girls. The one things most people would have a problem with
doesn't seem that much of an issue! You have your girlfriend, and she
seems to be keeping your very, VERY happy." Off to the side Anya
smirked at that as Willow invaded Xander's personal space further. "I
LOVE her Xander." Off to the side Tara gasped and looked around the
room as Willow looked back over her shoulder and smiled. "I do." Tara
looked around the room, looked down, and then looked back at Willow.
"I l… love you too."</p>

<p>Xander sank down next to Anya. "I don't see what this has to
do with Faith?" Willow's steps followed him. "It means this, until
Faith does something to hurt someone anything between her and Buffy is
between her and Buffy." Willow turned and sat back down next to Tara,
an action that didn't relieve the tensions in the room, but it stole
their focus. Buffy turned to Riley. "Riley, we'll talk later, right
now I need to talk to Faith." He looked confused. "Why? I mean her
feelings for you are just that, her feelings. They don't have anything
to do with you." Buffy looked shocked. "How can you say that?" His
expression still seemed confused. "Well it's not like you return them.
Do you?" Her eyes widened. "That doesn't matter!" He took her by the
elbows. "Do you?"</p>

<p>She yanked her arms free and turned towards the door while
speaking. "I have to find Faith." He looked as if he was ready to grab
her again, but didn't as she sped out of the door; it slamming shut
behind her. The object of her search was at another house, literally at
Buffy's doorstep. "Faith?" "Mrs. S" Faith could see the elder Summer's
apprehension and shook her head. "It's ok Mrs. S. I'm not here to hurt
anyone. I'm just here to apologize for what I've done then I'll be out
of your lives forever." Joyce's expression softened. "Won't you come
in?" Faith nodded slowly and followed Joyce into the house. "You know
then invitation thing only works on vampires?" The slayer's slightly
jesting tone made Joyce smile as she turned to face her.</p>

<p>"Look Mrs. S. I know it's not like anything I would say would
be enough, but I still had to say it. You know?" Joyce nodded silently
as Faith continued. "You were right. I really am unhappy, but that
still didn't give me the right to spread it around." Joyce looked at
Faith for several seconds. "I'm a mom, and I knew that deep down you
really wanted to be a good kid. I forgive you Faith." To her surprise
Faith was blinking back tears. "Look at me. I decide to turn my life
around and I turn into a fucking fire hose." She realized her cursing
at the last second and looked ready to apologize but Joyce dismissed
it with a smile. "You are finally expressing all the things you
bottled up. Buffy's says that a good cry is an essential slayer
skill." She noticed that Faith flinched at the mention of her
daughter's name. "Have you spoken to Buffy yet?" Faith simply nodded.
"It will be ok. Summer's women are notoriously stubborn, but she has
too kind a heart not to forgive you. She'll come around"</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. "She already did, pretty much, but some
things came up." Joyce scrunched her face in confusion. "Like what?"
Faith shook her head again. "Nothing, thank you Mrs. S. Now is that
part where I disappear into the night." Joyce stepped closer. "Do you
have to?" Faith nodded. "I think it's for the best." Joyce didn't seem
to agree but she followed Faith to the door. "If the night ever brings
you by again please stop by." The young woman nodded as she stepped
from the Summer's porch and walked into the night.</p>

<p>Her path took her back to the mansion where she immediately
walked to her bags and began packing. She was so focused on the goal
that she didn't hear Buffy as she stepped out from her hiding spot. It
was not until Buffy began to speak that Faith realized she was not
alone. "Running again?" Faith seized up in shock and a single word
escaped her lips. "Buffy." The released breath sounded like a prayer,
or perhaps a plea, but it vanished as she looked back over her
shoulder. "For me to run I would have to have something to run from.
Just moving on." Buffy stepped closer. "What about Giles?" She shook
her head. "He's busy being your watcher, and I think Wesley deserves a
second chance." Her back was to Buffy so she didn't see the blonde
force herself to stop shaking.</p>

<p>"What about… what you said?" Again Faith shook her head. "I
didn't say anything before, and I shouldn't have said anything now."
She then turned around and saw that Buffy was on the verge of tears.
"Please Buffy, don't cry. You've got a life. The American dream.
You're getting the education, you've got the friends, the family, hell
your dating GI Joe." Buffy laughed slightly at that. "The last thing
you need is a repentant head case dragging you along her road out of
hell." Buffy's head shook as she stepped closer to Faith. Faith looked
as if she wanted to step back but the couch was already right behind
her and blocking her way. "I already sent someone to hell. Now I'd
like a chance to help someone back." Faith tried to make a scoffing
sound. "Before or after you beat me to death?"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "Don't Faith." With no fear the smaller
slayer took the others hands in her own. "I was angry Faith. All the
times I reached out to you and you turned to Angel." Faith looked like
she wanted to speak but Buffy silenced her by slipping one of her
hands free from Faith's and placing it on Faith's lips. "It's ok. The
important thing is that you're back. Not how you got here." Both of
them were on the verge of tears as Faith nodded and Buffy pulled her
into an embrace. Buffy's voice was barely a whisper. "You're back."
They rested the foreheads together. They stood silently in each other
arms, and when they finally broke the embrace the both looked pained.
Buffy looked into Faith's eyes. "Welcome Home." The smaller slayer
already had a tear running down her cheeks, and that seemed to start
the other crying as well.</p>

<p>The tears were silent tears of joy however as they both smiled
at each other, until Faith blushed. "Buffy, about the other thing…"
Buffy again put a finger over Faith's lips. "I don't know about the
other thing, but WE will deal with it." Faith nodded slowly, smiling.
While both girls had parted there would not have been room to fit a
third person between them. Buffy looked down. "I left the rest of them
pretty quickly. I probably should go check on them." Faith nodded. "Go
be with your friends." Buffy paused. "I can't speak for Xander or
Riley, and Anya. Well you got more of a response from Anya then most
of us do. So that has to be a good sign." They both smiled at that. "I
do know you have me, Giles, Willow and Tara, and I'm sure mom will
welcome you back."</p>

<p>She saw the slightly guilty look on Faith's face. "Faith?"
Faith kept looking at the floor. "I talked to your mom. She's cool
with me now." Buffy smiled, then just as quickly she frowned. "I
really should go check on them. I'll see you later." Faith nodded.
"See you around B." Buffy shook her head. "No, see you later." She
paused to think. "Like tonight at seven for dinner?" Faith's eyes got
wide and she nodded silently. "I'm willing to bet you haven't eaten
since LA." Faith spoke quietly. "Haven't really been that hungry."
"Well ya gotta eat. Any idea what your hungry for?" Faith shook her
head and Buffy again paused. "Ok, how bout I pick you up here at seven
and then we decide?" Faith nodded. Buffy smirked as she left. "I think
we need to get some food in you. You're making Tara look chatty." The
last sight Buffy saw as she left was the mock look of indignation on
Faith's face.</p>

<p>"You're going out on a DATE?" "Riley sit down! You too
Xander." Considering Buffy had her back turned while she was facing
Riley it was even more shaming as Xander sank back down. "It's not a
date." Riley had yet to sit down. "Not to you maybe, but what about
her?" Buffy had found them much as she left them except Riley Finn
seemed about as upset as Xander while Willow, Tara and Giles seemed as
bored as Anya normally was. On her way back she had made a stop by
home where her mother had voiced her support and it made what she was
saying all the easier. "Riley, I'm with you. You have to have faith in
that. I'm not even attracted to other women."</p>

<p>From the couch they heard Willow. "Well I wasn't either
until…" The entire room looked at her and she blushed. "Never mind."
Buffy simply blinked for several seconds and then turned back to a
triumphant looking Riley Finn. Buffy was about ready to speak when
Giles interrupted. "Even if that were the case it wouldn't matter.
Whether it would be another man or another woman a relationship is
strong enough or it isn't." Buffy looked at her watcher gratefully
while Riley's expression was far less kindly. "Riley, you trust me, or
you don't." He shook his head. "It's her I don't trust." Buffy shook
her head. "It's not about her Riley! Faith isn't out to kill me, and
she can't make me do anything I don't want to." While he still didn't
look convinced he seemed unable to come up with an argument to that.</p>

<p>It was perhaps predictable that Xander didn't seem to let that
stop him as he stood up. "Yeah, but what will happen when she gets you
alone?" Buffy openly rolled her eyes. "What? She's going to seduce
me?" Xander stood back up. "Yeah but she may go all sapphic slayer on
you and steal a kiss like she did in the mansion." "She didn't steal a
kiss! That was different." "How?" She paused. "Faith was… saying
goodbye." Xander scoffed. "What, doesn't a wave cut it for her?" Buffy
looked lost in the memory as she replied. "This wasn't just a
"Goodbye, See you tomorrow." kind of thing." Xander stepped close and
his voice softened. "No Buffy, it was Faith saying goodbye to the
woman she loves. It was at that point she went "Fatal Attraction" on
you." She looked him in the eyes as he continued in a calm voice.</p>

<p>"I know Buffy, you don't feel that way towards her. I also
know how seductive she can be, and even if you turn her down who's to
say that won't set her off again?" He didn't see that his girlfriend
had rose to her feet at the last part of his sentence. "WHAT?" His
eyes got wide, and everyone there would say they could see his life
flashing in them. He turned. "Anya, I…" She screamed "YOU!" and then
slapped him and then stormed out the door as he followed right behind
her. Riley's sad expression seemed touched with amusement at the
scene. "He's right Buffy, and you know it. Faith may be entirely
sincere, but another rejection might send her right back over the
edge."</p>

<p>"So what would you have me do Riley? She tells me she loves
me, do I just spit on her?" Unbidden that memory from when she was in
the other slayer's body came to mind. It was not something she had
really shared with the others because it was still able to rattle her
every time she thought about it. He shook his head. "Just be careful."
Her expression softened. "I will." Both of their postures relaxed and
he took her in his arms. She nuzzled to his broad chest and he seemed
to savor the feel of resting his cheek to her head. "So do you girls
need a chaperone?" While his tone was playful the relaxed posture of
Buffy Summers became slumped, and then hardened. "No Riley, that will
be ok." Agent Finn couldn't help but be rattled at the coolness of her
tone. The only times he had heard her use it was when talking to
demons, or his superior officers.</p>

<p>She pulled out of his arms and took a step back. "Listen
Riley, I am not one of your soldiers that you can give orders to, and
right now I'm not even sure if I want to be your girlfriend." The
injured expression that crossed his face caused her to pause. "We'll
talk later ok?" He took a step closer. "Do you see? She already has
you about to break up with me." The slayer's nostrils flared. "She"
has nothing to do with it, you do. Riley, I am not just your
girlfriend, I am not just Buffy Summers, I'm the slayer. That's what
this is about. I am not some defenseless maiden needing you to ride up
and save me." Again an outburst from Willow interrupted the
conversation. "Cowboy Guy!"</p>

<p>Everyone stared at Willow with their confusion apparent, but
Buffy quickly recovered. "I'm not looking for a protector Riley, I'm
looking for a partner." Buffy then took the path that Xander and Anya
had taken by storming out. Riley seemed to look plaintively to Giles.
"Doesn't she understand that I'm trying to work with her?" Giles began
cleaning his glasses while looking sorry for the young man. "She's
never had such problems with the rest of us. If anything we have had
to show her that she can rely on us." Riley nodded. "I'm going to as
well." He then took the same path but more determined then angry.
Giles sighed. "I suppose we should call… or "beep" Buffy." He looked
plaintively at Willow and it caused her to grin as she got up and
walked to the phone.</p>

<p>Tara followed her as Giles watched off to the side. The shy
blonde's voice was even quieter then it usually was as she whispered
to Willow. "Do you think Buffy feels like that for Faith?" Willow
actually looked shamed when as she entered the numeric message to
Buffy. "Do you remember when I said I liked having something that was
mine?" Tara blushed as she nodded which caused Willow to smile at her.
"That's what Buffy had with Faith. They were the "chosen two"… and I
was jealous of how much time they were spending together." Tara looked
upset, but Willow smiled. "Not that way, I just felt like I was
loosing my best friend and instead of seeing it was giving something
Buffy needed and I harped on Buffy about it. I was Xander."</p>

<p>Tara smiled and put her hand on Willow's. "You c…could never
be that bad. S…still Faith did do all those bad things." Willow
nodded. "Maybe it would have been different if Buffy had felt freer to
be there for her. There's nothing I can change, but I can try to do it
right this time." Tara smiled at her again and Willow smiled back. The
two started to get lost in looking into each other's eyes, but they
became painfully aware of Giles obviously NOT watching them. The pair
smiled shyly as they turned to face him and Willow spoke. "She's got
the message, and now we wait. Got any cards?" Tara was about to reach
into her purse but quickly dropped her hand. Willow smiled at her and
Tara looked down. "Just t…tarot." The other two grinned and Giles
spoke. "How oddly appropriate." Tara seemed surprised as Giles began
clearing a spot at the table while Willow took her by the arm and
guided her there. </p>

<p>Buffy had gotten the page and was in the process of looking
for a payphone. While she had felt justified in storming out it was
not until she had that she realized she had three hours before she was
supposed to meet Faith. Sure she had said pick up Faith, but it was
just dinner, not dancing or anything. Of course the thought took Buffy
back to when she DID dance with Faith and her heartbeat kicked up a
couple notches. She clamped it back down as she shook her head to
herself. Ok the dancing with Faith was fun, but that's all it was.
Buffy believed that back then, and now she was able to believe it for
all of five seconds. Of course back then she didn't think that much
about it. That was what she loved about Faith, for once in her life
she didn't have to wrestle with inner turmoil, she could just feel.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped walking and stood stunned in the middle of the
sidewalk. Love? What she loved about Faith? When she began walking
again it seemed to help her think. Was it her fault? Sure she had fun
with Faith, but did she lead the feisty brunette on? Buffy was aware
that Faith had not had much love in her life, and it sickened her with
guilt to think that Buffy's friendship could have led Faith to think
there could be more. The problem with that was that Faith never seemed
to expect that from Buffy. If Buffy HAD been leading her on Faith
wouldn't have hid her feelings so long. It was more that she loved
Buffy, but had accepted that Buffy could never love her "that way". Of
course Willow's slip seemed to bring that into question.</p>

<p>It hadn't been entirely easy when Willow… came out to her, but
Willow was her friend, and if Willow was in love then Buffy was happy
for her. Was that it? Did Willow's coming out hit too close to home?
Did it have anything to do with Willow at all? Buffy had to resist the
urge to scream. Still, Willow's decision didn't have anything to do
with her. So Buffy figured it wouldn't have anything to do with
Willow, but could she be considering it? Did she have feelings for
Faith? She had just argued with Riley that she didn't, but then there
was Riley. After you got over the whole "worked for a government
agency that thought they could deal with the Devil and not get
burned".</p>

<p>Still Riley came through in the end, but so did Faith, even
when in a coma. Faith came through in a dream no less, and Buffy knew
it was her. She didn't know how, but she knew it really was Faith. Not
like the dreams she had of Angel where she dreamt OF him. With Faith
she dreamt WITH her. It hurt to think it, but she had never dreamed of
Riley, at least not in that way. The only dream she could remember of
Riley was the one the first slayer gave her when Riley and a human
looking Adam plotted world domination… from their pillow fort. Of
course when she dreamt of Angel it was right before he lost his soul,
was that was it cost people to love her? Angel said he was in the
business of saving souls, had Faith lost hers for the same reason
Angel did? </p>

<p>It was with a sickening lurch she realized where her feet had
lead her. The mansion stood before her the shadow from the house
covering her both body and soul. A place filled with memories and none
of them good. The place where she sent Angel to hell and where she
chained him while his mind returned after he got back. It was also the
place Faith chained her, or at least thought she did as she prepared
to have Angel torture her. Yet it was also the place that she kissed
Buffy goodbye. The same impulse that led her there led her inside. As
she walked through halls, dark even in the dwindling light of day she
saw a light, but it was not from the fireplace, that had fallen into
cold, dead embers. The light was cast by Faith, and like a moth to
that flame it pulled her forward. The other slayer was training, but
with Angel's Spartan decorating that was probably all there was to do.</p>

<p>Faith was wearing a sports bra and sweat shorts to make it
easier to move. Strong, smooth motions of the other slayer were almost
hypnotic. The speed and grace that Buffy remembered were still there,
but Faith had also found focus. Before Buffy used to watch it to help
Faith find her weaknesses, now Buffy just liked watching it. She liked
seeing the rippling of muscle along Faith's frame, and the light sheen
of perspiration that had broken out seemed to give Faith a glow. The
entire effect was rather soothing to her, calming. Faith seemed at
peace, and Buffy felt at peace as well, and when she jumped as she
turned to face Buffy, Buffy jumped as well. "Buffy!" "Faith!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I lost track of time. I'll go get ready."
Buffy shook her head. "No, it's ok. I'm way early." Faith padded
barefoot to the couch and picked up a towel which she rubbed over her
neck and shoulders absently as she looked closely at Buffy. "Something
wrong B?" They both sat down on the couch as Faith lifted her chin and
rubbed the towel over her chest. Buffy had seemed in contemplation
before jerking her head up. "Really big fight." "Bout me?" Buffy shook
her head and Faith gave her a doubting grin. Buffy smiled rather
sadly. "No, not really. I mean that's what they SAID it was about, but
it was something more. Really it was just Xander and Riley. They were
both freaking out over us going to dinner." Faith looked down at her
feet and wriggled her toes. "Sounds like that's about me."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head and placed her hand on Faith's knee just
under the hem of her sweat shorts. "No Faith. It's not you. Xander…
Xander is Xander." While Buffy knew that was utterly vague Faith still
nodded in understanding. She pulled her hand away, but didn't notice
that Faith's eyes lingered a second when Buffy's hand had been.
"Riley… well you know how I've had to hide being a slayer from my
dates? Riley, Riley acts like he WANTS me to hide that I am the
slayer. I mean he thinks I'm reckless, but he doesn't realize that I
can lift him above my head." Both of them grinned at that as Faith
spoke. "Could it be the whole soldier thing? I mean they either give
orders or take them, and not from women?" Buffy's face scrunched up. </p>

<p>"He's not that bad. I think he just doesn't realize. I mean
his training was to protect people weaker then himself, and I don't
LOOK that much bigger." Faith smiled. "Yeah Buffy, but you ARE. Anyone
can see that the first five minutes." Buffy blushed at that as Faith
continued. "I mean after watching you slay, well even Xander knows you
can take care of yourself." Buffy rolled her eyes. "He just doesn't
like to admit it." Faith seemed unwilling to look Buffy in the eyes.
"What about the others?" Buffy smiled, but the way Faith was hanging
her head kept her from seeing it. "They trust my judgement. I mean
they are willing to tell me when I am making a mistake, but they agree
with me being here… and I'm glad I am." Faith looked up at that point,
and was unable to hide her smile.
 </p>
<p>"So what would you like to have?" Faith shrugged. "Well you
probably know the scene more then I do, but we don't have to go out."
Buffy perked up. "What? You want to order in?" Faith blushed. "That,
or I can cook." Buffy grinned. "You can cook?" Faith continued
blushing as she nodded while Buffy kept speaking. "Id like that. A
nice home cooked meal." Faith rolled her eyes as she stood up and
threw the towel over the back of the couch. "Do you want to eat right
away? Or do I have time to hit the shower?" Buffy grinned. "No, I want
to see your homemaking skills." Leading the way Faith led Buffy into
the mansions normally neglected kitchen. It seemed a little dusty, but
there were some fresh utensils and a small assortment in cupboards
left slightly open. Buffy slipped up to the counter. "I always
wondered why Angel kept a kitchen."</p>

<p>Faith shrugged. "Probably needed a place to store his blood
supply." The two paused and looked at each other for a beat, then
Faith spoke. "Let's see what's in the cupboards." They both grinned as
Buffy nodded. Faith started searching the cupboards, but Buffy noticed
that she had seemed to have slowed down with something else on her
mind. The way Faith's muscles tensed up caused the hairs on the back
of Buffy's neck to stand on end. While Faith sounded all too casual as
she spoke they seemed to be sharing the silent communication like they
did when they patrolled together. "I'm going to go see if Angel put
anything in the pantry. Buffy knew that even if Angel was willing to
keep a kitchen he would have never bothered with keep a room for food
he would never be able to eat.</p>

<p>What she did know was that the direction the dark slayer had
taken led to an outside door. She also knew that Faith excused herself
so she would not alert whoever or whatever had alerted her. That meant
that she had left Buffy to play the distraction, and while she didn't
like it she did her best. Shuffling around the kitchen, looking like
she was considering the items she found when in fact she was straining
every one of her enhanced senses to pick up what ever Faith had.
Heartbeats stretched into minutes until she heard it! The sound was
unmistakable. It was the grunt of pain that Faith allowed herself to
make when she couldn't keep a painful hit inside.</p>

<p>What she didn't hear was the dark slayer slipping silently out
a side door. She had feared that might giver her away, but Buffy's
night stalking ex had apparently made sure to keep the mansion well
maintained and the well oiled hinges didn't give her away. Faith's
senses had jumped into hyperactivity like Buffy's had, but instead of
straining they were searching, probing the inky blackness for a sign
of whatever tripped that sixth sense all slayers had. She immediately
knew it was not any type of demon because air was cool and clean with
impending night. In fact the scent seemed more human, she first
considered Xander, but she knew Xander's scent, and it was not his.
Then it clicked, it was a scent she knew, but one she smelled in
another body. Riley, Buffy's boyfriend and Faith's one night stand.
Part of her wanted to go in and just tell Buffy, but another part of
her recognized an intruder. </p>

<p>Faith was sincere in her desire to turn her life around, but
she had a promise to Angel and Wesley to take care of herself, and not
letting someone sneak around her house seemed like a good start. It
might not be actually hers, but Angel said she could use it as long as
she wanted, and that was enough. Her hands clenched into fists and
then spread into talons as she slunk down closer to the ground. While
Angel might have maintained the house the yard did not seem high on
the vampire's list of priorities and the grass felt rough under her
bare feet. Yet it also muffled what little sound her fest might have
otherwise made as she sniffed the wind and drew closer to Riley's
hiding place. Of course she guessed it would have been where he could
spy on the kitchen, but she was letting her senses prove what her mind
had deduced. </p>

<p>She was close enough to hear his breathing, and she had to
give the soldier credit. He knew how to stay concealed, how to keep
quiet. If he were facing someone other then a slayer he might have
actually remained hidden. Then again Buffy already said how he
underestimated her, and apparently Faith rated no higher in his mind.
"The doors on the other side." While Riley had been lying prone he
rolled to his feet instantly as Faith smirked at him. Trying not to
enjoy the look of shock on his face. "I said, the doors on the other
side. Has a buzzer and everything." He continued to glare at her. "I
won't let you hurt her." Faith's smirk vanished. "I have no intention
to." His eyes stayed cool focused, and while it didn't show he went up
several notches in Faith's estimation, her muscles tensed even
further. </p>

<p>"You may have fooled Buffy, but she's trusting, innocent, a
lot like Willow, and you managed to pull the wool over both their
eyes." Faith's breathing was deep and regular. "Look, I don't give a
damn what you think of me, but leave this place or I'm calling the
cops." He smiled a dark smile at that. "You're the felon. Who do you
think they'll believe?" She shook her head as her body shifted into a
defensive position. "Correction, suspected felon, and I can call the
house's owner to confirm I have the right to be here. Unless you want
to call your Uncle Sam you got nobody." He seemed ready to launch
another retort, but he instead launched an attack. The punch was
directed squarely at her head, but she was ready for it and ducked
below and outside, which put her in a perfect position to drive her
knee up into his kidney. Unfortunately her hair had grown longer
during her coma and it provided a perfect hand hold as Riley grabbed
and yanked hard enough to pull Faith off of her feet and land hard on
her back.</p>

<p>He was immediately ready to deliver a punch to her while she
was downed, but she managed to get her hands underneath her and kick
up to place both her feet into the center of the man's chest. She had
been tempted to deliver the blow to the man's throat, but she knew it
would have been instantly fatal. As it was it lifted Agent Finn into
the air and deposited him in a sitting position on the firm ground. He
quickly tried to regain his feet, but Faith did a kip up and sprang
back to a standing position. The two faced each other warily trying to
find an opening when they heard the outraged shout of Buffy Summers.
"Riley! What are you doing here?" He never took his eyes off Faith.
"Defending myself from her!" Faith looked shocked. "Liar! You attacked
me!" Riley didn't reply until Buffy blocked his line of sight by
stepping right in front of him.</p>

<p>"You still didn't answer me! What are you doing here?" He
hooked a hand around her shoulder to pull her away as he kept his eyes
on Faith. "I'm trying to protect you!" He found her immovable as she
set her feet. "From what? Faith's cooking? I'm sure it's not that
bad!" Faith looked as if she were trying to decide if she should be
offended. She then relaxed her posture. "Look, B. I'm not helping.
I'll go hit the shower and you two talk. Then just come tell me if I'm
cooking for one or two." Riley growled. "One." Buffy puffed up her
admittedly small frame. "I don't remember putting you in charge of my
dinner arrangements." The yelling seemed to fade for Faith as she made
her way back into the house, but it remained as loud as ever for the
two still outside.</p>

<p>"Riley, what is it you are not understanding? I am having
dinner with a friend. Ok, it's a friend with a past, but just a
friend! Your acting worse then you did with Angel." When he looked
away shamefully her eyes darkened. "That's it. Isn't it? Your consider
her competition. What is it because my best friend is bi? Maybe you
think Willow will infect me or something?" Riley looked offended. "No!
Of course not!" "Then what is it Riley? Do you thin Faith's going to
get me alone and sway me to the "Dyke Side of the Force?" The shamed
look returned to his face. "Hey, she is capable of anything. I mean
she stole your body." A light seemed to go on behind the slayer's
eyes. "That's what this is about isn't it? She seduced you and now you
think she's going to seduce me?" She laughed bitterly. "Go home
Riley." He looked like he wanted to say more. "Go home Riley, Go home!
Get away from me!" </p>

<p>She turned and stormed back into the house not even looking to
watch as Finn turned and walked away.  Buffy was still breathing
heavily as she walked back into the house. At least until she walked
back towards the shower. She felt the humid air, but didn't register
that she no longer heard the water. What she did register was Faith,
clean and slightly pink from the warm water. Buffy realized that Faith
was pink all over as the other slayer had nothing but a bath towel
clenched to her stomach, which did nothing to hide Buffy from seeing
Faith in all her glory. She took in the familiar things like Faith's
face and legs. Her eyes seemed to get a mind of their own as they
looked at firm round breasts with brown nipples that had stiffened in
the cooling air, and the dark patch of hairs at the juncture of
Faith's hips. </p>

<p>She stared for several seconds until Buffy spun around and
looked at the wall." Faith! Oh God I'm sorry!" The voice that answered
her seemed soft, and to Buffy it felt like it slid up and down her
spine. "It's ok Buffy." When the blonde didn't reply the voice seemed
to draw closer, as if it were responsible for making her ears burn. "I
don't mind if you see me, do you? Unless of course you liked what you
see?" Buffy's only answer was a futile attempt to swallow. She felt
Faith's strong hand gently grip her shoulder and turn her around, and
while she was looking directly into Faith's eyes the other woman's
naked body seemed to be radiating a heat directly into Buffy. "Did
you?" Buffy breathing had deepened, and as she felt Faith's breath
across her face she knew she was not the only one. </p>

<p>"All you have to do is say no. Say no and I'll stop." No words
seemed to make it to Buffy's lips before Faith found them. The feeling
of Faith's mouth against her own caused Buffy to gasp, and Faith took
it was invitation to slide her tongue inside Buffy's mouth. Yet it was
not an invasion, but a penetration, firm, but gentle first sliding up
and along the top of Buffy's mouth. Then sliding along her teeth and
pressing onto her tongue, and her tongue responded. Eagerly,
passionately, yet Faith's tongue seemed to try to control hers. It
calmed Buffy down, drew the kiss out. It had gone on several minutes
with only minimal breaks for air until Buffy's hands went weak and
dropped down, right onto Faith's naked derriere. </p>

<p>Buffy's hands immediately dropped away and the kiss broke
right after, even though Buffy's mouth moved with Faith as she pulled
back. All to steal another moment of contact. The women panted as they
gazed into each other's eyes until Buffy spoke. "I should go." Faith's
old mask of indifference slammed into place. "Yeah ok." Buffy's
expression seemed confused and afraid, but then her face steeled and
she grabbed Faith in her arms. Faith seemed completely stunned as she
found the smaller slayer wrapping herself around Faith's naked body.
"Let's train in the morning at Giles place. You can meet your watcher
all over again. Then we can come back here and you can fix me
breakfast." The last part was said rather shyly, but Buffy was smiling
and Faith did as well as she nodded.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" Buffy couldn't help but grin at her
roommate as Willow's initial exclamation degenerated into babbling.
"Well ok, mom tone aside. We beeped you awhile ago!"  Buffy sat down
at the desk. "Yeah, I got it, but I was already at the mansion."
Willow's eyes got wide. "Oh?" Buffy gave her friend a pointed gaze.
"You knew Riley was following me, didn't you?" Willow sat down on the
edge of the bed across from Buffy. "Well, not really "following you"
but that he was in a general "I'll do Buffy's thinking for her." Frame
of mind." As Buffy replied she couldn't keep from sighing. "That about
sums it up. He follows me to the mansion, and then gets into a fist
fight with Faith." Willow looked worried. "Did she?" Buffy shook her
head. "Riley was the one lurking in the bushes. Got into a big fight.
He seemed to think that since Faith managed to seduce him that I was
no match for her."</p>

<p>Willow scoffed. "That's ridiculous! You've been Faith's match
ever since she got here!" When Buffy gave Willow a questioning look
the redhead blushed. "I mean match in the able take anything she could
give. In mean in the fighting sense NOT in the smooching sense." When
Buffy seemed unable to look Willow in the face Willow's eyes narrowed.
"Or do I? Where there smoochies?" Buffy blushed. "One, one smoochie
one very long, very naked smoochie." "You were naked?" Buffy shook her
head, as she blushed further. "No, Faith was naked. I walked into the
shower with out thinking." Willow's smile grew sly. "So… how was it?"
Buffy's chest rose as she breathed in deep. "It was… unbelievable. I
mean I love Riley, but I haven't been kissed like that since Angel."</p>

<p>Willow grinned. "You sure do have a thing for the bad boys…
and girls." Buffy's eyes opened. "I do not! The girl thing is not an
issue. I mean it's… Faith. Ok, Faith is girl shaped, but that's not an
issue." Willow looked overly innocent. "So you didn't like what you
saw? Not one bit?" Buffy blushed, but didn't reply, and Willow
developed a rather devious grin. "Come on Buffy. Think about who
you're talking to." Buffy smiled slightly as she shook her head. "I
know, preaching to the converted, but you know me Willow I mean not
only have I gone for guys. I've gone for the brawny guys, Angel,
Riley, even Owen had that broad shoulder thing going." "Maybe you like
your girls for contrast, or maybe you were just overcompensating."
Buffy rolled her eyes. "What girls Will? Girl, one, singular."</p>

<p>Willow kept grinning. "A chosen one huh?" Buffy arched her
eyebrows dangerously, but it simply caused Willow's grin to grow. She
kept grinning as she stood up. "I should probably call Giles he was
the one who suggested we page you." She was interrupted however as
Buffy stood up with her. "I'll do it. I need to schedule some training
time for me and Faith in the morning anyway." Willow grinned and
nodded as she stepped away, only speaking while Buffy dialed. "So a
training date?" Buffy scowled at a still grinning Willow as she heard
the receiver pick up. "Hello?" With out even thinking about it Buffy
smiled at her watcher's voice. "Hey Giles, just calling to say I'm
home and everything's fine." The normally cool tones shoe with obvious
relief. "Buffy, good. Did Riley find you?" She nodded silently even
though she knew the gesture was wasted. </p>

<p>"Yeah, Faith caught him playing peeping tom." Giles reply
sounded slightly shocked. "What?" "Faith discovered someone was
watching us. When she went out to see who it was she found Riley.
Blah, blah, blah, big fight, Riley went home." His voice was now more
curious then concerned. "Now when you say big fight do you mean thrown
words? Or thrown fists?" Buffy squirmed; again knowing it had no
effect. "Both actually, he took a swing at Faith and I took a shout at
him. Speaking of which, I kinda told Faith we should meet at your
place in the morning for some training." The Englishman actually
seemed both surprised and pleased at that. "Yes, that would be lovely.
So Faith will be staying with us?" "Yeah, you'll have two slayers to
have to keep track of." He actually sounded pleased for his first
sentence. "I will expect you both bright and early. We will also want
to consider the reaction of Mr. Finn." </p>

<p>The tone had darkened for the last part and it had transmitted
right to Buffy. "I know. I'm going to have to talk to him. He's going
to have to see that Faith has a place here." "What if he refuses?"
Buffy's voice had a trace of its slayer steel. "He wont." Her voice
softened again. "I'll see you in the morning Giles." She hung up the
phone after his reply of "Goodnight Buffy." She didn't bother turning
to Willow. "You can wipe the smirk off your face." Willow was still
smirking but she was also trying unsuccessfully to look innocent.
"Jeez Will. You keep this up and people really will think you are
trying to convert me." Will scrunched her face back up. "It's not
that. Like you said, you haven't been this excited since Angel."
"Woah, woah, I never said that." Willow made a dismissive gesture.
"Still Buffy, this is someone who excites you, and I want to support
that this time."</p>

<p>Buffy sat down next to Willow. "What do you mean?" Willow hung
her head in shame. "When Faith first got here I was jealous of the
time you two spent together." First Buffy looked shocked. "Oh no
Buffy, not like THAT. I mean I thought I was loosing my best friend. I
didn't get it then. I didn't get it until I met Tara." Buffy remained
silent, but her face seemed to ask for more. "I didn't realize what it
feels like to have someone who just gets you. I mean sure you have the
friends and the family, and they try to understand, but like with me
and Tara. She just understands me. That's what you have with Faith,
were both witches, your both slayers. Tara and I are both shy; you're
both outgoing. I mean sure there are differences, but what would be
the point of being with them if you were identical?" </p>

<p>She nodded as they both wordlessly got ready for bed, but her
actions were done on autopilot as she thought about Willow's words.
Her and Faith were a lot alike. Approximately the same age, kind of
the same personalities, both slayers. Of course they were also both
girls. While Buffy considered herself a 21st century gal there was a
big difference between accepting your roommate is bi and accepting you
might be as well. Yet every time she tried to talk herself out of it
she flashed back to Faith, specifically Faith fresh from the shower.
There was no way for Buffy to deny it, she liked it, more then liked
it she loved it. The look, the smooth skin and soft, yet well defined
curves. She loved the scent, clean, healthy, and desiring Buffy as
much as Buffy was desiring her. </p>

<p>She didn't allow herself to linger on when she touched Faith's
naked flesh, let alone when she pressed herself to it, but found she
could think of little else as Willow shut off the light. Faith was
thinking similar thoughts as she laid down to sleep. Could it be that
all she had to do was be honest? She knew that when she kissed Buffy,
Buffy kissed back, and it had all the energy and life that had first
drawn her to Buffy. Could it be that honesty would have saved her all
the heartbreak, given her a chance at the life reality had denied her
so far? Faith wasn't sure, but the feel of being in Buffy's arms told
her she was on the right track.</p>

<p>Yet while the slayers started to dream Spike knew there was no
rest for the wicked. Of course William the Bloody had went from as
wicked as he wants to be to as wicked as he's allowed to be.  As
allowed as some damn peace of technology let him be. He took comfort
in the fact that it was a machine and would break down eventually, but
the fact was he had never been patient as a mortal, and had not
learned any patience after he became a member of the undead. He wanted
the damn thing out NOW. The futuristic Frankenstein Adam had promised
to remove it, but got caught up in getting his technological heart
ripped out by Buffy. "Teaches me right for making a deal with a demon,
even a puzzle piece one." While Spike was talking to himself he wasn't
worried about being overheard.</p>

<p>He knew that the slayer was tucked away in her dorm room with
her little Wiccan friend, because people may have called Spike
violent, brutal, and possibly thickheaded they never called him dumb.
His bastard of a sire Angelus had beaten any dumb out of him in
Spike's first half decade of undeath. Considering he had no real way
of defending himself from the Slayer he contented himself with keeping
an eye on her movements. Sure it wasn't precise, but in times like
this it allowed him a certain measure of freedom, because while the
slayer slept most of Sunnydale's demons still hid, just thinking she
would jump out and strike them down. It still amused him to think
about it. One tight arsed, tiny blonde and they acted like she was
some damn avenging angel.</p>

<p>Of course after storming the Initiative Spike thought they
might be right, but he had survived a tangle or two with the slayer,
and he wasn't afraid. Of course with the chip in the head he wasn't
her archnemesis, he was her damn lap dog. Worse off then Angel because
Angel had a soul that wanted to be her lap dog, Spike had just been
put on the leash. His musings were interrupted as he passed by the
mansion, the place where he spent months recovering from the Slayer
bringing down the roof right on his head. Of course it was also the
spot Buffy first brought him to heel by getting him to attack his
sire. While he actually enjoyed the hitting his sire part he didn't
like that it helped the slayer, but his sire was such an ass it
actually gave them something to agree on. </p>

<p>What worried him was the fact that the mansion seemed active
again. He could see the furniture's dust covers were gone, and some
window's were even open. Which was perfect in his mind because Angel
hadn't been living in centuries and wouldn't be safe from Spike even
in his current condition. The old hunting skills returned immediately
as Spike inched closer. He stopped on the edge of the property line
looking over the place. The memories of his sire, and Dru were pushed
back into his memory as he looked for traps, or alarms or snares. He
didn't know what Angel would plan, but the gaining of a soul hadn't
done anything to his sire's tactical ability. Of course then he
noticed there was no car and figured Angel was probably out covering
patrol for Buffy. So he decided to head on in and set a trap of his
own.</p>

<p>As he approached the window he stretched his hand out towards
the windowsill and ran smack into the invisible barrier that damned
all of his kind. He turned abruptly as she heard footsteps behind him.
He looked into the sneering face of Riley Finn. "You're getting rusty
Hostile Seventeen." Spike straightened out and threw his shoulders
back. "Kind of stupid to call me a name given by a place that no
longer exists." Riley shrugged. "Yeah but its legacy still lives on
inside your head." Spike snorted and took out a cigarette. He was half
way to lighting it as Riley spoke again. "How would you like it out?"
Spike paused a second, and then lit. "And how would that happen? When
I saw you in uniform it was not a white lab coat." Riley nodded.
"True, but you forget who assistant I was. I removed my own control
chip with a broken piece of glass, but I don't even need to do that. I
can shut it off with a signal."</p>

<p>Spike blew a puff of smoke. "Now why would you want to do
something like that?" Riley shrugged. "It was the whole point of the
Initiative. Use monsters to fight monsters, both foreign and
domestic." Spike laughed. "Ahh so I would have been some sort of super
assassin?" Again Riley shrugged. "Something like that. It was the
first design where would couldn't have killed a living being unless we
allowed you." Spike grinned. "Now what would your slayer sweetheart
say about that?" Riley shook his head. "She doesn't need to know, and
she never will. Now, do you want to be able to kill again or not?"
Spike held his cigarette between his first two fingers and shook them
at Riley. "Lemme guess, you figure you'll set ol Spike loose on
someone, and then kill me before I can hurt anyone you don't want me
to?"</p>

<p>Riley didn't respond and Spike grinned as he took a drag off
his cigarette. "You got it soldier boy. Who dies?" Riley didn't blink.
"Faith." Spike did blink. "Faith? The other slayer." Riley nodded once
as Spike spoke. "Ahh, afraid she'll kick your ass if you faced her
yourself didn't you?" When he saw Riley's angry flush at his words he
laughed. "She already did! Well you got it soldier boy. Shut off the
chip I'll drive on up to where ever she is and get a third slayer
under my belt." Riley shook his head. "She's in there. That's why you
can't get in. Angel has pretty much given her the place so it's a new
owner, new house, and a new invitation." "All right, all right, bit of
a challenge, but I like a challenge. Now… SHUT OFF THE DAMN CHIP!" </p>

<p>Riley held up his hands. "Spike, Spike you're going to wake
Faith up." Spike growled quietly. "Shut off the chip and I'll be as
quiet as a bloody Church mouse." Riley nodded. "The reason I picked
you is because despite your being a demon you do have some odd sense
of honor. You kept your word with Buffy. Will you give it to me?"
Spike rolled his eyes and held his fingers up in a Boy Scout salute.
"Vampire's honor. Now turn off the chip!" Riley seemed reluctant, but
he took a device out of his pocket and pressed a button. Spike
suddenly felt a pressure release inside his head and automatically
shifted into game face. Riley saw that and stepped back, which caused
Spike's visage to get all the more terrifying as it smiled. "Don't
worry Riley. I'll kill Faith for you. Then I'll turn her. Split you
and blondie between us." Riley's expression darkened and he reached
inside his jacket, but they were both interrupted as they heard the
voice of Faith. "Some of us are trying to get some sleep!"</p>
