<p>Faith stood across from the two men as Spike looked up and
down her body. "I guess I heard right, you really do like slaying in
the buff. Or are you here for the full gallop?" Faith's left hand was
spread wide as her right gripped a wooden stake. "Sorry Spike, but the
complexion problem is a big turn off." "Oh I'm hurt." He attempted to
hurt her as he lashed out with two rapid right hand punches. Faith
blocked both with her right arm and slashed the stake across Spike's
chest, but the vampire managed to pull back just enough so that she
missed him. Riley had the gun out and seemed to be trying to decide
which to shoot. Something both of his potential targets noticed. Spike
responded by jumping back from the line of fire. While Faith twisted
and hurled her stake into his shoulder as a shot went off and to the
side Faith jumped back and landed with the small of her back on the
windowsill. She grabbed it with both of her hands and flipped back
inside.</p>

<p>Riley was still standing, but he had dropped his gun. His one
hand hung uselessly while the other was trying to pull the wooden
stake free. He was still trying when Spike walked up to him, still
grinning in game face. "Don't worry. I'll still keep my part of the
bargain. I'll kill Faith, but I won't promise that you'll be alive to
see it." With that he yanked the stake from Riley's shoulder. Riley
gave a bitten down shout as she dropped to his knees. Spike smiled as
he considered the stake. He then licked Riley's blood from it and then
dropped it in front of him. He was laughing as he strode off into the
night. The next thing that penetrated was the sound of Faith's voice.
"He's over here!"</p>

<p>He tried to get up and run away, but two men were grabbing
him. He brought his one good elbow up and into one person's
midsection, but as he did the person on his injured side threw their
weight on him and the added pain on his shoulder sent him back to his
knees. He then felt a forearm clench across his windpipe. "Can't you
drug him or something?" He recognized Faith's voice posing the
question and it sent a fresh dose of adrenaline through his system. It
was actually enough to get him starting to pry Faith's arm from around
his neck, but as he did so he felt a hypodermic needle stick in one of
the veins on his neck, and then he didn't feel anything else.
Including dropping to the ground in a boneless heap.</p>

<p>What he felt next was waking up in a hospital bed with one
large bandage on one arm, and a handcuff on the other. His waking was
too late to hear Buffy's arrival to the hospital. "Faith? What
happened?" The dark slayer looked up from her seat in the waiting
room. When she saw they were alone she looked at the ground and spoke.
"I staked him." Behind Buffy's shoulders Xander spoke up. "See?" He
was universally ignored as Buffy sat down next to her. "Why?" She kept
looking down. "I didn't want to give him the chance to decide between
shooting me or Spike." Buffy blinked. "Spike? What was Spike doing
there?" Faith shifted uncomfortably in her seat. "He was talking with
Riley."</p>

<p>They all could see that Faith had more to say so Buffy asked
the question. "What would they be talking about?" Faith swallowed. "I
woke up and heard some yelling. So I grabbed my stake and moved to
investigate." Xander piped in. "Were you naked again?" Faith shrugged.
"I was thinking "grab weapon" not "grab pants". Anyway I went out to
investigate, and I saw Riley pushing some button, and then Spike was
in game face." Faith took another deep breath and deliberately didn't
look at Buffy. Then I heard Spike tell Riley "Don't worry Riley. I'll
kill Faith for you. Then I'll turn her. Split you and blondie between
us." They all fell silent, even Xander seemed torn between if he
wanted to call Faith a liar, or use what she said as proof of how bad
Riley was. Buffy nodded. "Are you sure that's what he said? That he
would kill you FOR Riley?" </p>

<p>Faith looked plaintively at Buffy. "Look B…" Buffy shook her
head and gave Faith a tired smile. "I believe you. I want to think
that you only heard part of the conversation, but I know you're not
lying to me." Faith smiled in relief and as the only one looking in
Buffy's eyes at the moment she was able to see a seconds softening.
Just as quickly it was gone. The expression on her face was what she
had when she met the Master after rising from the dead to destroy him.
"I have to talk to Riley." They all nodded or looked away as a
familiar, determined stride headed towards the room that held Riley
Finn. After they heard the door close Faith stood up. "Can I talk to
you Xander?" Xander looked to Giles, Willow, Anya, and even Tara, but
none of them seemed willing to help, Anya had forgiven him for his
past indiscretion with Faith, but seemed unwilling to help him avoid
another one.</p>

<p>She led him to a stairwell. "Ok Xander. I want to make things
right with everyone, including you. Now how can I do that?" "Xander
stared at her as coldly as he could. "What about Riley? How are you
going to make amends with him?" Faith shrugged. "I hid the gun he
pulled on me. I think that about sets things right. Now Xander… what
will it take to get you to trust me? Or if I can't get you to trust
me, what can I do to get you to tolerate me?" He started nodding.
"Stop making moves on Buffy." Her jaw dropped, then she took a breath.
"Xander, I'm not making moves on Buffy. I, I just… look I can't change
how I feel for her? I don't know if I would even if I could. I mean
Buffy's like coming into a warm house after the snow. Like wrapping
yourself up in a blanket that's all fresh and warm from the dryer.
It's not a matter of making moves on Buffy, it's a matter of not being
able to deny how she makes me feel."</p>

<p>Faith had focused on what she had been saying, and had not
seen how Xander had nodded at her description of her feelings. "Well,
corny poetics aside, I do understand that. I'll also forget the whole
criminal past thing. I was once possessed by a hyena spirit that
stripped away my morals." While Faith gave a slight scowl at Xander's
"corny poetics" comment she then looked curious. "What did you do?"
"I… I ate a pig." "A pig? Was he dead and called bacon?" Xander shook
his head. "No he was alive and called Herbert. Among other things." He
looked ashamed. "I tried to rape Buffy." Faith's expression seemed
amazed, but he saw no condemnation there. "I faked amnesia, but either
way Buffy managed to forgive me… I guess I should be willing to do the
same for you."</p>

<p>She looked curious. "Even?" He shook his head. "Friends…
loosely casual acquaintance friends, but friends." She smirked.
"Anya?" Xander nodded. "She may no longer have her powers, but a
millennia's worth of vengeance is not something you want to play
with." Faith nodded, and the both smiled slightly as they walked back
out to join the others. As the two got back they all looked at Anya,
the former demon just looked up and spoke. "Xander knows better."
While Xander looked slightly put out the rest grinned as they sat back
down. Unaware of what was happening behind Riley's door.</p>

<p>When she first stepped through the door he couldn't help but
smile, then he saw her expression and his smile vanished. He was not
dealing his girlfriend, or with the woman Buffy Summers, this was the
Slayer, and for the first time Riley was able to understand exactly
what that meant. While he wouldn't admit it to anyone, let alone
himself, when he looked into her eyes he felt fear. "If you want to
deny what I am about to say you can, but I will go to Spike for
clarification since it concerns him too." The fearful look that
crossed his face at that mention answered her question for her, and
while it may have caused her some sadness inside, no trace of it
showed. "Why?" He seemed to be trying to think of something to say but
she cut him off. "You haven't denied anything. So now it's just a
matter of why. Spike's probably out there killing someone, and not
only is that your fault but both slayer's are busy with you so they
are not out there trying to stop him. In one minute I am going out
that door to do my duty and put down that monster you unleashed. Is
there anything you have to say?"</p>

<p>Riley wouldn't meet her eyes. "I guess Faith was successful,
she broke us up." Instead of replying Buffy moved to stand right in
front of his bed. "I never told you the details of my dream sent to me
by the first slayer. Needless to say you were in it. You and a fully
human Adam were in some Initiative designed living room plotting world
domination. When I asked you why you told me it was what governments
do. The Riley Finn I fell in love in would never do that and he would
never unleash an animal like Spike. The Riley Finn from my dream, now
he would have no trouble doing it, and wouldn't care who happened to
die in the process as long as he got what he wanted." Riley looked up;
any pain he was feeling was ignored. "Buffy, I swear I was going to
kill him." She stepped up and rested her hands at the feet of his bed.
"What? After he killed Faith? You know it was wrong and that's why you
can't look at me."</p>

<p>The thing that seemed to be unnerving Riley Finn the most was
not the look on the slayer's face, or the way she didn't walk as much
as stalk, each movement laden with repressed power. What really shook
him was the fact Buffy's voice hadn't changed, and she hadn't yelled.
The fact was Riley had literally seen her read a menu with more
emotion. "When I was in LA I told Angel I knew you. I was wrong." With
that the slayer walked out of his room, and Riley knew it was for
good. The cuff had been removed because he learned that Faith had
refused to press charges, and even explained away his hitting of one
of the paramedics as a panic reaction after being stabbed. He tested
the shoulder and found the wound was not too deep, and so he started
to get dressed.</p>

<p>Out in the other room Buffy emerged still in slayer mentality,
and her eyes immediately locked with Faith's. "Spike's still out
there." Faith nodded and stood up, Buffy then nodded. "Are you ready?"
Faith looked down. "It's been awhile, but it's not the kind of thing
I'd forget." Then to the surprise of the rest of the room Buffy
smirked. "We'll start slow." Faith looked a bit shocked but smiled as
she accepted a stake as followed Buffy out of the hospital. Willow was
the first to speak. "Did Buffy seem a little…" Xander finished her
sentence. "You Jane, Me Jane as well?" Willow nodded, and then they
all did.</p>

<p>"You keeping up Faith?" "Look around little slayer, I'm ahead
of you." What had started out as a jog around Sunnydale's vampire hot
spots and turned into a footrace. Somehow they knew that Spike would
not remain still on his first night back in full control of his
actions, and neither were they. Yet Spike seemed to dwindle in their
minds as they allowed themselves to get lost in the night. Hearing
only their footsteps and their breathing, everything else was quiet
around them. It was as if the night new that predators were about, but
not the predators she was used to. These were the hunters of hunters,
the predators of predators. Yet the night also seemed to welcome them,
wrap around them, cloak them as she did all of her denizens. Night
being just an observer in the contest. </p>

<p>They felt buoyant, light, and yet utterly aware. The very
texture of night lifting them like a bird on the wing, a falcon on the
hunt. Faith turned her head to see her partner's response, but only
saw a blonde blur hurtling towards her, and driving her towards a
patch of grass. She landed on her back and attempted to roll, but
found she was pinned by knees at each of her hips and strong thighs
that pressed on her to keep her immobile. "I guess I win?" Buffy's
chest was heaving from the run, and something more. Her eyes were wide
and dark as she leaned over Faith. While Buffy's hair hung over her
face like a mane Faith's was spread out like a halo. Buffy leaned over
further, examining Faith's face, and she even seemed to be sniffing
her. Yet Faith was arching her shoulders to do the same.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Faith's voice was dry, breathless. "What's
happening?" Buffy shook her head. "I don't know, but I like it." At
that point Faith's head shot up to capture Buffy's lips and they were
taken. Both women kissing, pressing, and purring? They both wondered
what had come over them, but deep down they didn't care, the self
delusions, the illusions, the fronts they put on for others were
suddenly stripped away. Faith had risen to a sitting position and
taken Buffy with her when they both smelled it, blood, human, and a
lot of it. While they broke the embrace on some level they never lost
contact. Both of them slipping into the shadows and stealthily
approaching the source of the scent.</p>

<p>When they recognized the familiar landscape of the Sunnydale
university Buffy darkened. The choice of locales was deliberate; Spike
was hunting on her territory. She tried to think who would be easily
accessible in the early morning, and Buffy silently led Faith to the
janitorial closet. They didn't need to go to the closet because they
found the janitors cart, with its materials strewn about it and it's
owner lain out on top of it. Like some post modern altar its bloody
sacrifice's throat lay open, but both were familiar enough with
vampires to know that no sacrificial blade had made the wound. They
recognized it as a vampire "playing with their food". Some vampires
would not settle for their fangs puncture wounds and would instead
gnaw at the opening and tear it open wide, both to increase their
victims suffering and gorge on the jetting blood, or as Buffy had
called it "slamming a person".</p>

<p>As they both lean in to examine the corpse they saw its dead
hands gain new life as it grabbed each of them by the hair. They could
both see it's game face as Buffy brought her forearm across the
vampire's and it's hands jarred lose. She continued the action as she
grabbed onto its wrists and pulled them above its head. The vampire's
struggles were shaking more cleaning products free, and as Faith
staked it the struggles continued as it shook its own ashes free. The
near by janitors closet splintered as it burst from it's hinges and
four more newly sired undead stepped out. Buffy was the first to meet
the attack as she ran forward and drove her shoulder into the
midsection of the first vampire out the door. Balled fists attempted
to smash down on Buffy's back in a crude axe handle but she had
already drawn back enough to employ her stake and all that crashed
down on her was the soot that marked another passing of one of the
undead.</p>

<p>Faith had followed right behind Buffy, but she instead kicked
what little there was left of the door back closed, and when the third
vampire reached his midsection through the shattered area she grabbed
him by the shoulders and forced him down on a shard of wood that
impaled his heart and destroyed him. The second vampire managed to
connect with the back of her head, which stole her equilibrium. When
she heard Buffy move to fight she dropped prone and rolled out of the
way, but before she could spring back to her feet the fourth and final
vampire burst through the remains of the door and tried to attack
Buffy. The older slayer didn't even have time to recognize the threat
before Faith swept the creatures legs and laid the creature flat on
it's back.  She got back to her feet in the same motion that she drove
her stake into the second vampire's chest while Buffy simultaneously
drove her stake into the heart of the last vampire.</p>

<p>The two were looking at each other with disbelief. The fight
had provided some twisted sort of release and now they were both clear
headed and thinking. Even newly sired, five vampires should have left
them more winded then this. Faith looked at Buffy. "Like or not, I
think we need to figure out what's happening." Buffy nodded. "I don't
get it. When did Spike need a cleaning service?" Faith rolled her eyes
and then they both paused and spoke as one. "The only other thing
would be he needed shock troops to play a diversion." "Hellmouth?"
Buffy shook her head. "He doesn't want to end the world, just us." Her
eyes went wide and Faiths did as well. "Scoobies?… Hospital!"  The two
ran for the exit.</p>

<p>The night swallowed them once more, as they ran no longer a
race they ran through the Sunnydale streets. The night was no longer
holding sway as the earliest risers were starting to peek their heads
back into the outside world. Yet even as they did they chose to ignore
the two girls with the determined eyes and break neck pace. As they
turned the corner they saw the hospital, and the flashing red and blue
lights from both the hospital's own ambulances and from the squad cars
of the Sunnydale PD. The smell of newly spilled blood reached their
nostrils and in a magic trick worthy of the finest magician their
stakes appeared in hand. They immediately put them back into
concealment as they tried to slip around to another entrance. While
they managed to find another way in they still were unable to avoid
the police. "I'm sorry ladies, but this is a crime scene. The hospital
has converted the main entrance into an emergency room until we finish
our investigation."</p>

<p>Buffy was about to speak, but Faith beat her to the punch.
"But I know a guy in there. He got stabbed on my friends property."
The cop's expression seemed to grow sad. "Riley Finn?" With out
thinking both girls nodded. "Well, who ever stabbed him must have come
back to finish the job. He was dragged out of here not over an hour
ago." Buffy then spoke before Faith was able to. "By who?" Though she
already knew the answer. "Some pale blonde guy. Right now we are
thinking some radical race group because both fit the white Aryan male
image. The attacker was described as inhumanly strong, with a scarred
up face. We think he was hopped up on PCP or something similar. Are
you friends with a "Rupert Giles"?" The girls both nodded. "He's being
questioned in the make shift ER while he's being tended to." He saw
they both looked scared at that fact and shook his head. "Don't worry,
just some bumps and bruises when he and your friends tried to keep Mr.
Finn from getting taken."</p>

<p>The cop then pointed to a sign that had been set up to give
directions. "You'd girls best get home and lock your doors. If you
want a police escort just ask the officer present." They walked away,
both looking confused, Buffy being the first to speak. "Now that was
an almost pleasant conversation." Faith nodded. "With a cop." "Think
we've been going about it all wrong?" Faith shrugged. "Cops are people
to." Buffy looked at her sharply and Faith continued as they walked.
"Well most people are assholes, and so are cops, but most of the time
let them do their jobs and they'll leave you alone." They nodded and
walked quickly towards the temporary ER. "Buffy." Buffy pulled Faith
to a stop and smiled at her. "Faith, I was thinking about my feelings
for you before I ever… well, mounted you."</p>

<p>While they both blushed Faith looked uncomfortable. "Yeah, but
I was the one who came up with the whole hungry and horny thing."
Buffy stepped close to her and looked into her face silently until
Faith met her eyes. "Yes, but being a slayer is part of me, and now
I'm realizing that you are too." Faith blushed and tried to look away,
but Buffy managed to catch her with a warm, tender kiss on the lips.
As the kiss broke they resumed walking and Buffy resumed speaking.
"It's not that you don't get me… well horny, but it goes far deeper."
She reached out and took Faith's hand as Faith began to speak. "What
if at least part of it is because we are both slayers?" Buffy
shrugged. "I guess we'll just have to struggle on and carry that
burden." Buffy was grinning and it caused Faith to grin as well.
"Struggle or snuggle?" Buffy laughed. "Either way."</p>

<p>The make shift emergency room actually seemed quite calm, and
in a way that was disturbing because it said Spike had set his mind on
something other then carnage when he had stormed the hospital. They
were able to find Giles by finding the police officer standing over
him. They all looked up but it was the officer who spoke first. "Buffy
Summers?" Buffy nodded with out thinking. He then turned to Faith.
"Faith Pryce?" They all looked a little shocked as she nodded. "Miss.
Pryce, you were listed as the resident of the home where the first
incident took place. Correct?" Faith nodded as the officer continued.
"Do you know Mr. Finn or his attacker?" Faith kind of glanced at Buffy
out of the corner of her eye and knew that they needed to give a
version that approximated the truth. "Buffy and Riley used to be
dating, and I've seen the guy in some of the bad parts of town."</p>

<p>He gave her an arched look, and Faith looked down at her feet.
"I didn't always run with the right crowd." The officer then turned to
Buffy. "You and Mister Finn had been in a relationship? May I ask the
cause of the break up?" This time Buffy met Faith's gaze. "I met
someone new." The officer looked at her to continue, and Buffy just
nodded towards Faith." The officer's eyes narrowed and he nodded. "So
your former boyfriend and an unknown male were seen outside the home
of your current girlfriend?" They froze as Buffy spoke. "Yes, but how
do you know this guy did it?" The officer seemed to pause. "I can't
say much about an on going investigation, but prints pulled from the
weapon that was used on Riley Finn seem to match ones we picked up in
the Emergency Room. I'll want all of you to look at some mug shots."</p>

<p>Giles then stood up. "Of course officer, but could it wait? We
have all been up all night, and through a terrible shock. I had
already given you the information to contact us. So is it something we
could possibly put off?" He nodded slowly. "Sure, just stop by the
station first thing tomorrow. Would you like a officer to escort you
home?" They shook their heads, and he then turned to Faith and Buffy.
"This added element is making us think it could be a combination of
crime of passion/hate crime." They both nodded as Buffy spoke. "The
other guy said you thought it was some right wing Aryan group?" He
nodded. "They have been moving in steadily from the coast. Look, we
don't have anything for sure, but the fact is this guy drove a wooden
stake into your ex-boyfriends chest, and if he is willing to do that
to someone he was supposedly working with then I pale to think what he
would do to two young ladies."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "Paling would definitely be involved." "If you
would be willing to stay in the same place I will have a unit keep an
eye on you." They all looked at him, and saw the determined set to his
jaw; Buffy sighed and then nodded. The rest looked a bit shocked but
hid it well as Faith spoke. "The mansion?" They all nodded. The
policeman then smiled. "All right once the doctors check you out we
will get you all home and then set up shifts to keep an eye on you."
Giles then spoke. "Is this standard procedure?" The cop shook his
head. "Anyone who would grab someone right out of a hospital is not
the kind of guy you want to let your guard down around." Buffy spoke
as they began following the officer. "You have no idea."</p>

<p>Xander was pacing. "Well normally it would be I go to the
mansion and THEN the hospital, but I still see a pattern."  Buffy
looked out the window and then looked back. "Ok, the cops are doing
fine. Now we need to focus on Riley." She then looked directly at
Xander. "What? I'm focusing on Riley. Focused right on Riley Finn." As
he spoke he held his hand up and moved it in a straight line from
between his eyes. She then looked between Faith and Xander. "You two
come to an understanding?" They both nodded as Xander spoke. "You
two?" Buffy bit her lip but Faith grinned rather slyly at Buffy. "Well
if you count Buffy knocking me to the ground and sticking her tongue
down my throat coming to an understanding?" The petite blonde blushed
deeply, and then sighed. "Not the way I would have said it, but yes,
Faith and I have come to an understanding. She then spoke under her
voice to Faith. "And I was not the one with the lip and tongue
action."</p>

<p>Faith shrugged. "My tongue down your throat, yours down mine.
It was the only thing I could do with you pinning me on the ground
about to have your way with me." Buffy scowled at the dark slayer, but
she did not object as the rest of the group blinked in stunned
surprise. Buffy then squared her shoulders. "Questions? Comments?
Criticisms?" When the group remained silent Faith smiled and spoke.
"Me and B. Who would of thought it?" Except for an uninterested Anya
all hands raised, though Xander's was last, as he seemed to be
distracted. "Oh, sorry. I was thinking about it now." Everyone shared
a light laugh as Buffy quirked an eyebrow. "Everybody sure? I mean
it's ME, and FAITH, and the love that dare not speak its name." Giles
shrugged. "The first slayer told us that slayers are supposed to be
alone, and while we will always be there for you Faith will give you
the companionship that will make sure that never happens."</p>

<p>Buffy seemed to consider that when Willow stage whispered.
"The "slayer thing." Buffy then grinned at Willow and Tara. "You mean
like "spell stuff"?" The Wiccans simply blushed. Anya then spoke out.
"Considering the effect it is already having on Xander I think it's a
good thing." Xander blushed deeply. "Anya!" Buffy looked closely at
Xander. "You sure?" Xander nodded. "She's the first of your hunnies
that actually took the time to talk to me first." They both kind of
blushed and Xander looked closely. "What?" Buffy shook her head.
"There was one kiss." Willow grinned. "One NAKED kiss." Buffy looked
offended. "I wasn't naked!" Xander's eyes got wide, but not displeased
as he stared at Faith. Anya hit him in the shoulder and he stopped.
Giles cleared his throat. "Well suffice it to say the details are
insignificant. We are all happy for you. Now I believe we should focus
on Riley Finn."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "Ok. Why did Spike take Riley?" Faith was the
first to speak. "Well he took him with instead of killing him on the
spot, and only took him when he had the chance to nab the rest of the
Scoobies." Xander held a hand up now. "Ah, ah Faith. As Buffy's new
sapphic sweetheart you are officially one of the Scoobies again."
Faith made a playfully horrified face as Buffy grinned. "Faith's
right, Spike was there for something uniquely Riley Finn." Xander
huffed on his nails and polished them on his shirt. "Well I would say
he might have wanted Riley's military skills, but those aren't
uniquely his." Buffy shook her head. "Generally, but he was also part
of the Initiative." Willow spoke up. "Maybe he wants to make sure the
chip gets out."</p>

<p>Giles seemed to consider that. "It is possible that if it was
turned off Spike fears it being turned back on." Buffy sat down. "Yes,
but Riley probably would have done that already." Giles was distracted
as he nodded. "Yes, but perhaps it's easier to deactivate it then
reactivate it. Either way Spike probably would rather be safe then
sorry." Willow nodded. "I can check the files we managed to get."
"Good, good. We also need to consider that Spike may be using him to
get to Buffy." Buffy took a breath. "Then he made a mistake. I will
rescue Riley from his own mistake because it's my job, but he's just
another potential victim as far as I'm concerned." Everyone looked
worried at Buffy's words and the light slayer sighed. "Look, when
Ethan worked with Trick did you worry about him getting bit? Riley
worked WITH Spike to kill someone. The fact that it's Faith doesn't
matter."</p>

<p>Faith looked slightly offended and Buffy paused. "I don't mean
it doesn't matter, but I mean that he worked with Spike to kill
someone is the main thing." Faith stood up and wrapped her arms around
Buffy's shoulders, as the rest of the Scoobies seemed to find the rest
of the mansion fascinating. "B, you cared for the guy, ya loved him,
and I think we both know those kind of feelings don't turn on and off
even when the person goes bad." Buffy tried to look away but Faith
reached out and gently turned Buffy chin back to face her. "I'm not
saying you should work yourself into a panic or anything because
that's just not a slayer's style." The two grinned at each other as
Faith continued. "But don't try to hide your feelings with rage."
Buffy frowned and placed her hand on Faith's abdomen where she had
stabbed her.</p>

<p>Faith shook her head while placing a hand on top of Buffy's.
"Don't, the Mayor had to have known the cure for the poison and he
knew that I couldn't kill you on my own. So he wanted me to do it in
self-defense by forcing you to try to kill me. Buffy, I fired the
poisoned arrow." Buffy started to shake her head, but Faith leaned in
and kissed her on the forehead. "My point is that no matter what Riley
did, it doesn't mean it changed your feelings towards him." Buffy
smiled shyly. "Nope, you did that." Faith blushed. "That's good,
because I still will kick his ass if he tries to make a move on you,
but that's just a matter of protecting my territory." Buffy grinned up
at Faith. "Does this mean you're the butch one?" Faith arched her
eyebrows. "Was there any doubt?" Buffy puffed up her frame, and then
grinned and rested her head on Faith's chest. "Ok, you can look now."</p>

<p>The rest turned their heads back as Giles spoke. "Faith does
make a good point. Spike may have realized that there could be
lingering feelings that he may try to exploit." Willow seemed to be
encouraging Tara to speak, and slowly the shy blonde did. "He may also
t…turn Riley." Buffy stepped forward, her face a serene mask of
determination. "Ok Willow we need you to check those files. Tara, I
want you to see if there is a spell that would help us find Riley.
Xander and Anya, while we know that Spike can't get into the mansion
since Faith is now living here I still don't want to leave them
unprotected. So I need you to keep an eye on them, and on the cops."
Xander spoke as he, Willow, Tara, and even Anya nodded. "Think they
might check up on us?" Buffy shrugged. "If they do just tell them that
the rest of us went to bed. I am more worried about Spike turning them
into in appetizers and then turning you guys into a main course. As it
is he might turn them in order to get a vamp inside. So be careful of
ANYONE who comes to the door. Also, if we are not back by the time
classes would start have Willow and Tara call the college and take
personal days, tell them I am taking one as well."</p>

<p>She then turned to Giles. "I know you would normally been on
research detail, but you've never been shy about swinging a stake, and
Faith and I could use the back up. So we take your car and try to find
Spike." Giles and Faith nodded as the group split to carry out its
tasks. Buffy then turned to Faith as they walked out towards the car.
"How's that for butch?" Faith laughed.  As they climbed into the car
they both noticed Giles seemed the perfect chauffeur as he stared
straight ahead and pointedly was NOT looking at anything his
passengers did. Buffy smiled. "It's ok Giles. I'm sure Faith and I
will be able to keep our hands off each other." Faith's voice was then
heard. "At least until we find Spike. I make no promises about after
we dust him." "Faaaaiiiiittttttthhhhhh." The dark slayers only answer
was a throaty chuckle.</p>

<p>While there was no laughing back in the mansion there was
grinning. Both Willow and Tara were grinning at the pacing Alexander
Harris as he checked the window for the 4th time in a half-hour.
"Something wrong Xander?" While her voice seemed distracted she was
grinning. "What? No, just worried. I mean with the super soldier in
enemy hands I think we should all be worried." Willow nodded, but kept
smirking. "And we are." Then in a rare show Tara spoke up as well. "We
just know that Buffy and Faith will be able to take him." Since
Xander's pacing had his back to the two of them Willow allowed herself
to grin at Tara. "Oh, we should get food. You know how they are after
slaying." Xander wiped around to look at the girls as Anya spoke up
with out lifting her head from a magazine. "Girls, don't tease Xander.
That's my job."</p>

<p>He scowled. "Shouldn't you two be working?" They both nodded
as Tara spoke. "A…Angel has a good assortment of spell books, but it's
almost all protection or exorcism spells." Willow peeked up from her
computer screen. "I think I'm having better luck. Spike's chip is also
a tracer so the Initiative could track him. " Xander nodded and sat
down next to Willow. "Good, good, does it have an on switch?" Willow
nodded. "It does, but the files describe a set up they would need to
carry inside a van." Xander winced. "Ok, ok, what about the tracer?"
"That's a smaller unit that each team leader was supposed to carry."
Xander and Willow looked at each other for a long moment until Xander
got up. "I'll beep Buffy and we'll get them to go get it from Riley's
place." Anya looked up. "Have them get a pizza too."</p>

<p>For the first fifteen minutes the slayers had been keep busy
by a cutthroat game of footsie. That was followed by perhaps 20
minutes of tickling, but now the playfulness had worn off and the both
were bored. They started to stare rather sullenly ahead when they both
noticed the quizzical look Giles was giving them. Buffy closed her
eyes and then opened them. "Giles…" His head snapped back ahead. "Yes
Buffy?" She slid forward on her seat. "Ok, so you noticed Faith and I
are acting strangely." He shook his head. "Your young and in love, no
further explanation is needed." "I wish it were so." Giles looked more
interested at the worried look on Buffy's face and how Faith slid
forward so there legs were touching and she could put her arm around
Buffy's waist.</p>

<p>"With Faith and me, it feels like… we're in heat." Faith
arched a brow as Giles blushed. "No, not like that. I mean like
literally in heat. I mean I was sniffing Faith." Giles seemed very
uncomfortable and took a moment before he spoke. "So you two are
"mating"?" Buffy blushed. "Well we haven't yet, but kinda, ya." Giles
considered silently. "I have to believe it has something to do with
our calling upon the spirit of the first slayer, and by extension
Faith." Giles didn't notice it, but Faith looked away slightly, but
Buffy did notice and looked concerned. Faith seemed unresponsive so
she settled for resting Faith's head to her shoulder, which seemed to
help. "Faith's entirely unique status probably play a part as well."
At those words Faith's head rose as they both listened to Giles as he
continued.</p>

<p>"There has only been one slayer, until now. We had assumed
that Faith simply possessed the slayer's gifts, but now that we know
there was a single slayer that has been passing her power from
generation to generation and slayer to slayer. So when a second slayer
was activated it is possible Buffy's gifts were split." Faith looked
concerned but Buffy silenced her with a hand on the knee, as Giles
seemed to get on a roll. "The attraction that the two of you
experience may also be tied to that. The two of you may literally be
different sides of the same coin. Yin and Yang, alpha and omega, light
and dark." The two looked at each other and smiled shyly. Do you think
that's it?" They both blushed as Faith then spoke. "Best idea so far,
but what about the jungle fever part of it?" Giles seemed ready to
stammer. "Buffy channeled the spirit of the first slayer and it would
seem that had unlocked some of the more primal instincts of the
slayer."</p>

<p>Buffy looked wide-eyed. "What can we do? I mean I don't want
to be collared and led around on a leash." Faith exaggerated a leer at
Buffy. "You sure bout that B?" Buffy smiled and rolled her eyes as
Giles took a breath. "Yes, well. I will start researching the previous
slayers and put the both of you on a strict training regimen. Both for
your physical abilities as well as your mental discipline." The two
seemed to pout at that, but nodded reluctantly. Buffy suddenly jumped
a bit and the others looked at her. "Sorry, pager started vibrating."
Faith smirked and Buffy rolled her eyes again. "Can you go five
minutes with out thinking about sex?" Faith looked like she was
seriously considering the question. "I'll need a stop watch, and you
in the other room."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled and shook her head. "It's Xander, we're supposed
to call him at the mansion." Giles nodded and began looking around,
finding a payphone to pull up to a moment later. He was actually close
enough that Faith was able to lean out and do the dialing before she
handed the phone to Buffy. At Buffy's curious look she smiled. "You're
the leader type, I'm just your woman." Before it picked up however
Buffy quickly put the phone back in Faith's hand. "Hello?" Xander's
voice was distinct over the phone as Faith put it to her ear. "You
rang?" "Faith, all right. Willow managed to find out the chip in
Spike's head is also a tracer. Team leaders were supposed to have the
tracker units, and were thinking Riley probably used that to track
down Spike." Faith considered that for a second. "But he didn't seem
to have anything like that with him at the mansion." </p>

<p>"Yeah, it's about the size of two game boys glued together end
to end. So he probably used it to get Spike's location, and then came
to find him personally. Still, best bet's his dorm room." Faith nodded
as Buffy and Giles looked on. "Any word on finding Spike's on switch?"
"Nope, at least nothing we can use. The portable version of the on
switch fit inside a van." Faith chewed her lip. "Ok, we'll just have
to deal with Spike the old fashioned way. Thanks, we'll stop by
afterwards either way." Xander didn't reply for several seconds, and
then when he came back he was mumbling. "Yeah, and if you could grab a
pizza on your way back." Faith laughed, and then she looked directly
at Buffy. "Yeah I know how I can get after slaying. Thank the rest of
the guys too if ya would." Faith then hung up. "Ok, Spike's chip does
allow him to be tracked but it requires a thingy about two and a half
to three feet long. They think Riley has it in his dorm room."</p>

<p>Giles nodded. "It's our first lead." He then turned the car to
head back towards the college. Buffy snuggled close to Faith. "Was
there anything else?" Faith shook her head. "Nope, I think that about
covers it." "What about how you get after slaying?" Faith appraised
Buffy rather directly. "You already know how I get after slaying."
Buffy squirmed for several seconds and then Faith grinned. "Oh, and
we're supposed to pick up pizza." Buffy took a breath and then sat
back in her seat. "Oh, a pizza, ok." Faith smiled and leaned back with
her, resting Buffy's head to her shoulder. As any of it's residents
could tell you, Sunnydale is a small town, and by the time they were
to the point of cuddling in the back seat they could recognize the
sights that lead up to the college. </p>

<p>When they saw Riley's dorm they recognized the signs of a
vampire attack. It reminded Buffy of Spike's first appearance in
Sunnydale when he attacked the parent/teacher conferences. Except it
did not seem as wide spread, like there were fewer vampires who tried
to make up for the fact with greater carnage. Again the police had
arrived there before them, but this time it was well before and the
police had been there for the attack. The girls realized this as they
passed a police car with one officer who had went through the
windshield. It could have been a crash if it weren't for the fact that
all of the broken glass was on the inside of the car. The slayers had
stepped from the car with their Watcher right behind them. "Do you
sense anything?"</p>

<p>The slayers seemed to shake their heads in unison, as Buffy
was about to speak for them. The radio is the police cruiser beat her
to it however as the frantic voice of the dispatcher was heard over
the radio. "Unit 12! Unit 12 Do you read?" The slayers looked at each
other as the announcer continued. "Calling all units, calling all
units. Officers Down, 2 suspects both described as athletic white
males, one is wearing a black leather long coat and is a bleached
blonde.  The other has been identified as Riley Finn." They all looked
at each other, but Giles was the first to speak. "I believe anything
of use to us will have already been taken.  It would be best if we
went back to the mansion." The slayers looked reluctant to leave, but
they knew that they had arrived too late. Faith accurately stated
their feelings as they got back into the car. "I'm getting sick and
tired of playing catch up with Willie!"</p>

<p>When they entered Xander was ready to speak but Anya beat him
to it. "Didn't have time to stop for pizza huh?" They all stared for a
second as Buffy spoke. "No." Xander shook his head. "The cops tore out
of here with something about an officer down call. Said they would
send someone to watch over us as soon as they can, but until that
point we should lock all the doors and windows and not let anyone in,
and at this point I have to agree." Buffy nodded and then took a
calming pause. "That will include Riley." The group that had been
gathered in the living room gaped at her while Faith and Giles looked
downward. "We haven't seen him, but it looks like Spike has turned
him. So if he shows up get me or Faith and do NOT invite him in."
Xander looked closer. "The officer down call?" "Riley's dorm, at least
one cop and probably plenty more people. We got there too late. Still
it's late, were all tired. Since the cops didn't notice we were gone
lets get some sleep and start fresh."</p>

<p>Xander looked around. "Ok, sleeping arrangements?" Most
everyone either shuffled their feet, smirked, or both as Faith grinned
while she spoke. "Well, there are plenty of bedrooms to choose from.
So I think we'll let everyone pick and just meet back here once we
wake up?" They all nodded and shuffled off Xander with Anya, Willow
with Tara, and Giles seeming to see where they went and then heading
the opposite direction. Faith slipped next to Buffy, actually seeming
shy as she spoke. "Should we head to bed?" Buffy was shy as well.
"Okay." Faith took Buffy's hand and led her towards the master bedroom
that she had taken up residence in. As they both entered the room they
kicked off their shoes while looking around and seeing the covers were
still turned back from when Faith had went to investigate outside the
house. It seemed an eternity ago, but was a simple matter of hours.
They both stared at each other until Buffy spoke. "Well you may be
ready for bed, but I seem to have forgotten my pjs."</p>

<p>Faith tried to look shy, but seemed unable to hide a grin.
"That's a problem. Isn't it?" Buffy smiled back at her. "Not really."
Faith looked into her eyes, and arched a brow. "Really?" "Well, you
seemed to think I should take after you, sleepwear seems a good
start." The both smiled and Faith's hands moved to the waistband of
her jeans, and then dropped back down. Buffy smirked. "Faith? Are you
shy?" Faith seemed to take that as a challenge and dropped her hands
to the buttons of her jeans. She then looked Buffy right in the eyes
as she unfastened them. Looking Buffy in the eyes she could see the
other slayers eyes had darkened with desire.</p>

<p>So Faith decided to make a show of it. Unbuttoning her jeans,
and then unzipping them, pulling the dark fabric wide to show the
rather plain white panties underneath. She supposed she was just lucky
the big guy braved the women's department at all, and of course he
would have had no way of knowing that she would wind up stripping for
his ex-girlfriend. She looked up and saw Buffy was unable to look away
as Faith slid the jeans down over firm, rounded hips and further to
pool at her ankles. When she stepped free she leaned over to pick them
up, fold them and set them aside. Having stood up she reached to her
collar and grabbed her shirt and pulled it up. "You going to get ready
for bed? Or do you need my help?" </p>

<p>Buffy shivered at Faith's suggestion, but she started
unfastening her own pants. Faith quickly pulled her shirt over her
head so she would not miss watching Buffy get undressed and Buffy
seemed to realize it. While she seemed shy, Faith could see the flush
coming to Buffy's skin and knew the petite blonde was enjoying getting
undressed in front of her. Buffy actually seemed to stop breathing as
Faith unfastened her bra. That caused Faith to smile wickedly as she
pulled it away. "Come on now B. It's not like you haven't seen them
before." Buffy had stripped down to her undergarments as she stepped
up close to Faith, voice almost a whisper. "Yes, and they are just as
beautiful as before." Buffy asked the question with her eyes, and
Faith answered the same way as Buffy lifted her hand up and cupped one
of Faith's breasts.</p>

<p>A moan escaped both of them as Buffy took her fingertips to
the tightening nipple. Faith bit her lip as she watched Buffy's
fingers first gently pinched the tip, and then rolled it between her
fingers. Her arms wrapped around Buffy where her hands quickly removed
the rest of Buffy's clothes. The contact never broke as Buffy stepped
free of her panties, but when Faith pulled the brassier free Buffy's
hand left her chest and moved to her waist to remove Faith's panties
as well. Now standing naked in front of each other the two slipped
onto the bed, over the covers, and met in a kiss. As their lips
pressed together their bodies did as well and both seemed ready to
swoon. While they had pressed together it was so much more intense
when they were both naked.</p>

<p>Buffy looked deeply into Faith's eyes and her expression
saddened. "Buffy?" Buffy tried to look away from the worry on Faith's
face, but Faith caught her cheek and turned her back to look at her,
and seemed relieved when she leaned into the touch. "Buffy? What's
wrong? You know we don't have to." Buffy's quickly shook her head.
"No, it's not that. I want to. It's just when I looked at you I
suddenly saw you with vampire ridges." Her hand dropped from Buffy's
face and joined the hands together. Faith lifted the hands to her face
and guided them along her brow, and her cheeks and chin until they
came to rest on her neck where she placed one hand's fingers on the
rapidly pounding pulse point. The smaller slayer seemed on the verge
of tears and she leaned in and kissed that pulse point. "But for how
long Faith? First Angel, now Riley…"</p>

<p>Faith's fingers ran through blonde locks as she gently guided
Buffy's eyes to meet her own. "We don't know that Riley has been
turned, for all we know Spike just managed to hook back up with
Drucilla, and I don't understand what Angel would have to do with it.
I mean he was turned centuries before you were ever born." Buffy shook
her head slightly in Faith's hands. "Yes but a vampire stole his soul,
and has probably stolen Riley's, and it's my job to fight them, and
that makes them a part of my world. Which puts everyone I love in
danger." She kissed Buffy's lips with exquisite tenderness. "First of
all everyone who loves you realizes the danger and accepts it. Second
of all me, Riley and Angel all would have been in the vampire biz even
if we never met you. Thirdly, It's my job too. I'm just as much a
slayer as you are." </p>

<p>The smile on Faith's face found it's way on to Buffy's as
Faith continued. "I have no intention of being just a lover Buffy. I
still want to be your partner, now I just want it to be in life as
much as in slaying."  The eyes that had always managed to captivate
her looked right into her soul as she was blown away by two simple
words. "You are." Two words that meant as much to her as "I do" and as
she looked at Buffy she knew they meant as much to her as well. Faith
leaned in and kissed Buffy again and gently eased her to lie down.
"Let's get some sleep."  Buffy nodded as she snuggled up next to Faith
and rested her cheek to the brunette's chest and wrapped her arms
around Faith's waist while resting her hands as the small of the dark
slayer's back. "I do love you." Faith smiled softly as she wrapped her
arms around the smaller woman's shoulders. "I love you to."</p>

<p>Buffy slowly blinked the sleep from her eyes, and while that
veil parted the caresses she had thought were part of it remained. Now
that her eyes were open she looked into soulful brown eyes that looked
like they had gotten caught doing something they shouldn't. Buffy
smiled into them. "Don't worry Faith. I like it when you touch me.
Just let me be able to enjoy it too." While the hands had stopped when
Buffy awoke, they slowly began to move again while Faith grinned at
her. Buffy smiled contentedly as she groaned in pleasure. "That's it."
Buffy's eyes had drift shut at the dark slayer's touch, so when she
felt soft, full lips kissing along her collarbone she whimpered. Her
hands moved under their own power to run her fingers through a soft,
brown mane. As a timid knock sounded on their door both groaned
angrily.</p>

<p>Faith stood up and stalked to the door as she put on her robe.
Slamming open the door a frightened looking Xander stood there. He
first looked at the mussed up Faith clad in only her robe, and then a
mussed up, naked Buffy sitting up in bed with a blanket tucked up
underneath her arms. A small grin had made its way back onto his face
as he turned back to face her glare. "Your going to strangle me again
aren't you?" First Faith seemed taken back, but then she realized the
grin on Xander's face and smiled as she shook her head while he
started to speak. "Umm, everyone is awake and waiting… we even got
bagels, if you're hungry that is." They both seemed to perk up at food
and Faith grinned. "I know I'm hungry. How about you B?" Buffy just
rolled her eyes at the both of them.</p>

<p>Buffy then sighed. "I guess we better get ready." She looked
about to move, but then she and Faith turned to look at an openly
staring Xander. Faith smirked and then shut the door in his face.  As
she turned back to the bed Buffy was looking archly at her. "What? I
really am hungry." Then she spoke under her breath. "Since I won't be
able to take care of the other one any time soon." Buffy dropped the
sheet and climbed out of the bed. "I don't know about that." Faith
smiled happily as Buffy continued to speak while getting her clothes.
"But if you want me to help you then you're going to have to wait."
The plain expression on Buffy's face had turned into a grin as Faith
chuckled and started looking through her own clothing. She looked over
at Buffy. "I'm not sure what would fit, but if you want to borrow some
of my clothes you can.  You might want to keep some of your clothes
here too. You know, in case you stay over again another night."</p>

<p>Faith had been attempting to sound casual, but Buffy simply
smiled and put her hands on Faith's firm, round hips. Pulling the
brunette close she stood up on tiptoe and kissed her. "Faith, I just
spent the night in bed with you, naked." Buffy then kissed Faith
again. "It's not the last time either." Her voice then got soft. "For
the first time in my life I love someone I want to plan a life with."
Faith didn't even try to fight the way that made her smile as Buffy
said. "I'm making those plans." Faith then grinned. "Hey! Don't I get
a say in them?" Buffy smiled sweetly into Faith's face. "No." Faith's
lips twisted into a pout. "I thought I was the butch one." The two had
been dressing as they spoke, and then Buffy walked to the bedroom
door. "That's what I let you think." </p>

<p>With a giggle the smaller slayer then ran through the door and
slammed it shut behind her. Faith laughed and ran up to it. She tried
the handle and found it immobile. The sound of Buffy's giggling on the
other side of the door told her why. She tugged and pulled, but the
older slayer seemed able to hold the door closed while her voice came
through the door. "Try huffing and puffing!" Faith smirked as she
spoke into the door. "I'd rather try eating you!" The voice on the
other side paused. "You'll have to catch me first!" Faith then tried
the door again and was able to open it this time. She yanked it open
to see the back of a rapidly retreating Buffy. She then took off in
pursuit. The giggling slayer led her on a chase to the main room, and
then just stopped suddenly. </p>

<p>Faith crashed into her deliberately as she wrapped her arms
around the smaller frame and lifted her off the ground. "Gotcha Now!"
She then realized they were not alone. Looking up she saw the rest of
the Scoobies smiling at them brightly. Even the uninterested Anya
seemed to make the effort to look pleasant. They all stood silently,
the Scoobies smiling brightly while the slayers fought not to blush.
Giles was the first to break the silence. "Nice of you two to join us.
Willow has already tracked down some of the equipment removed from the
Initiative complex. Considering his recent interest it seems our best
bet for finding him." Both of the slayers nodded, still not speaking.</p>

<p>Giles continued. "With Xander's military knowledge and
Willow's technical skills I believe they are essential. Unfortunately
we need to keep a presence here to keep the police occupied." Xander
then piped up. "That and there is no possible way we would all fit
inside your car." Giles rolled his eyes. "Yes, so Tara, Anya and
myself will stay here at the mansion and attempt the location spell to
find Riley." Faith smirked. "You think you'll be able to handle spell
stuff with the G-man Tara?" The shy blonde simply blushed as Willow
gave Faith a friendly glare. Giles started cleaning his glasses.
"Actually I am aware of the union she and Willow share, and it's
possible effects on her magic. I actually intend to assist her with
the research and then keep watch with Anya."</p>

<p>Faith smirked. "I was teasing Giles." He put his glasses on.
"Of course. We don't have much time before sun set. So I suggest you
get going." Buffy then spoke up. What about the photo line up thing?"
Giles then nodded. "Quite right. I will offer to go down to the
station and keep them busy." Xander was up and pulling the slayers
towards the door after he picked up the keys to the car. "All right,
sounds good. Say hi to Officer Don for us." Willow followed behind
after pausing, smiling and then giving Tara a kiss. Leaving the other
Wiccan sitting in the couch blushing deeply. Of course when she saw
Giles and Anya looking at her she simply blushed deeper.
 </p>
<p>Xander was sliding into the drivers seat as Willow took the
passenger seat and the slayers climbed in back. "All right ladies?
Where can I take you?" Buffy blinked. "Um, you know the location
Xander, not us." He paused. "Right." Then he started the engine. As
the old car engine labored to life Faith leaned forward in her seat.
"Way to make with the PDA Red." Willow smiled and blushed. "Well I
figured if you guys could do it then I could too." They both finally
did seem shy as Faith laid back in her seat and took Buffy's hand.
"Yeah." They all sat silently until they started to notice Xander's
frequent looks in the rearview mirror. Faith, Buffy and Willow smirked
in unison as Buffy spoke. "Xander? Is someone following us?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>The boy behind the wheel started blushing furiously. "Nope,
just want to make sure." The girls simply arched their brows at each
other as Buffy spoke again. "Way to be vigilant Xander." Willow spoke
up next. "Here we are!" The armory stood before them, and Xander slid
forward in his seat as they approached the gate. When the guard didn't
get up from his seat inside the booth they got worried and then pulled
back and parked Giles car on the street. As they got out they went in
and saw the guard had died at his post of two puncture wounds, and
then had been sat back down as if he were still on duty. Quietly
Xander slipped off the man's web belt and put it on. Picking up the
guard's rifle he turned around into the slightly disturbed faces of
Buffy, Faith and Willow. "They won't do him much good, but they might
help us get him some pay back."</p>

<p>They all stared at him as Buffy spoke. "Bullets don't kill
vampires Xander, you know that." He shrugged. "Yeah, but I think
you'll have an easier time staking Spike if he has half a dozen rounds
in him." As they left Xander slid into the front and Buffy nudged him
aside. Faith the spoke up. "Ok, when did you go Rambo?" Xander
blinked. "It's a military base, and with the skills Ethan gave me it's
sort of my environment." Buffy looked at him several seconds. "Well
it's vampires we're dealing with and they are mine." "Sorry mam."
Buffy and Willow gawked while Faith grinned at Buffy's expression when
she spoke. "Mam? When did I become a mam?" Xander seemed to shake
himself. "Sorry, Buffy." She seemed to eye him a bit and then stepped
in front and led the group further into the complex, first entering a
garage area.</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith took the lead while Willow slid into the
middle and Xander took up guarding the back, holding the rifle to his
shoulder as he kept it sweeping the area. Willow then heard Xander
speak. "They have a National Guard unit here don't they?" Willow
nodded absently. "Yeah, but I thought you didn't want to join the
Army." "But it's not the Army. It's the National Guard. I would still
be in the area, and I would have better access to gear." He fell
silent as he seemed to consider the idea, at least until Buffy and
Faith both stopped abruptly. They paused and then Buffy whispered over
her shoulder. "Vamp, dead ahead. Try not to shoot us too Xander." He
looked offended, but replied by tightening his grip on the rifle. The
slayers left Willow by Xander and spread up from the position.</p>

<p>The concrete floor insisted on displaying their footsteps, but
the open area also caused enough echoes to mask their exact location.
As they slipped closer to the vampire they detected they could hear
that the vampire was pacing. When they got close enough to see him
they could see it was Spike. Before Faith realized it Buffy had raced
across the space between her and Spike and slammed him against the
nearest wall. The wall in question was made of steel and concrete, or
so Faith assumed as she heard Spike's head slammed against it. Buffy
didn't seem to notice as she had one forearm across Spike's windpipe
while the other hand held a stake poised right above his heart. You
could never tell as much from Spike's voice as he started talking.
"Slayer, so you found the trail I left did you?" Buffy rolled her
eyes, took her hand from his windpipe and grabbed him by the front of
the shirt. She then proceeded to pull him back and then slam him back
into the wall. </p>

<p>"Now, now. I'm sure you want to blame me for all this, but
your ex is the one who took the leash off." Buffy growled. "Then you
promptly turned around and bit him." Spike smirked. "I'm a vampire.
Biting is what I do." "Well now you're going to bite the dust." She
drew back the stake, but Faith then stepped forward while she heard
Xander and Willow approach.  "Buffy, think. Why isn't he fighting
back?" Buffy seemed to consider that and her grip loosened. Spike
shrugged free, but then made no other move. "Quite right. I turned
Nancy boy in order to make sure he would be willing to take out the
chip and he turns around, stabs me in the back, and turns it back on!"
Xander had dropped the rifle to hold it at his hip. "He's a vampire,
that's what they do."</p>

<p>Spike growled at Harris, but the man didn't even flinch. Faith
noticed Buffy was almost as pale as Spike was and she stepped close.
"B? You ok?" Buffy shook her head and spoke in a very small voice.
"He's one of them now." She stepped close and took Buffy in her arms,
resting the smaller slayer's head to her chest. "Don't worry. I'll
stake him for you. You won't have to do it." Spike stepped closer and
examined the couple with a smirk on his face. "Well what do you know,
Riley was right you WERE out to bag Buffy." They both turned to glare
at him and he lost his smirk. "Which I think is a beautiful thing, you
know? Gay pride and what not." Buffy slipped from Faith's arms and
stormed up to Spike. "You may be defenseless, but don't think I'm
going to forget that you made him into a monster.</p>

<p>Spike looked down into the raging eyes of Buffy Summers.
"Let's be honest here Slayer. He was already a monster. If he wasn't
then how would he have been able to let me loose to kill Faith?" He
then lit a cigarette. "Just because it has a pulse doesn't mean it's
human." He noticed Faith regarding him rather intently. "Don't worry
pet. When he put the leash back on I pretty much gave up the whole
idea of killing you for him." Faith smirked. "Thanks, what about the
other way around?" Spike nodded. "Unlike my own shit head sire I won't
let my bad seed run around for centuries." Then they heard another
voice. "Well, well, two slayers, every vampire's fantasy." Riley Finn
stepped into sight, full game face on and a swarm of demons behind him.</p>

<p>Xander was the one to answer Riley as the rifle at his
shoulder unleashed a tongue of fire in Riley's direction. The former
soldier's instincts still seemed to be intact as he dived out of the
way, but the hailstorm did manage to catch one of his creatures and
sent one of his creatures squealing to the floor in a pool of dark
green blood. Willow had ducked down beside a near by jeep and Buffy
and Faith took that as their signal to jump into action. Each jumping
away from their starting positions to engage one of their demonic
foes. Spike chose to charge straight up the middle as he ran towards
his wayward progeny. "Come give daddy a kiss!" Riley had rolled to his
feet. "Ahh, but dad, I already gave you the gift that keeps on
hurting." The two vampires stalked around each other, both swinging at
apparent openings.</p>

<p>Xander held his rifle on them a second, but couldn't find his
shot. It was not a matter of being afraid he might hurt Spike as much
as it was he needed the majority of rounds hitting Riley. Instead he
crouched down next to Willow and braced the rifle on the jeep's frame.
He switched the fire selector from fully automatic to semi-automatic
and began seeking out targets away from the battling slayers. Buffy
was currently tangling with a Minotaur-like demon with neon blue and
pink making up his fur and flesh. "Faith!" The dark slayer glanced
over and saw the demon's height was giving it an advantage over Buffy.
She then looked back at her own demon was far closer to her own height
and took several steps back.  "Wanna trade B?" She continued to battle
as Buffy spoke. "You got it." Faith finished her demon off and moved
to another one. </p>

<p>"I don't know, this one looks pretty easy." She could see that
Buffy was just getting annoyed with her foe and was yet to be in any
actual danger so she allowed herself the banter. The light slayer was
breathless, but grinning. "I'll throw in a back rub." Faith grinned.
"Deal!" She then dropped to her knee at the side of a reptilian demon
that had human arms, but moved around on a reptile's tail. Since the
creature had to raise itself up on it's tail in order to attack so it
was unable to follow Faith before Buffy was able to move in, and this
time her height was an advantage because the creature's blows were all
going too high. Buffy had been fighting with a small one handed axe
and by aiming for the gaps in the scales the blade had no difficulty
sinking in.</p>

<p>Down on one knee she braced her hands on the floor and swung
out her feet to connect with the back of Buffy's demon's knee. The
creature crumpled and fell onto its back. She finished the motion by
tucking her knees under her and rolling up. Her left hand jerked the
creatures muzzle up while her right drove the knife she was fighting
with into the creature's neck. The creature screamed a warbling death,
but the amount of blood pouring from the wound let Faith know he was
not getting back up. The next thing she felt was hand pulling her up
and holding her in a chokehold from behind, but it was only there
seconds and the hands turned to dust around her neck. She turned and
Buffy was there holding the axe and standing in a pile of ash, the
body of the reptilian demon behind her.</p>

<p>They both turned and saw Riley fighting Spike. Faith spared a
second to look at Buffy, but she did not see a grieving girlfriend,
but a slayer and when that slayer looked into her eyes the both nodded
and charged. Sure demons reached out in them but flashing blades left
few alive, and none whole. Riley saw all that happen from his battle
with Spike and saw how few of his followers had survived the combined
efforts of the slayers and their sniper. Even his sire might not have
been able to beat him yet, but Riley was feeling tired, while Spike
was grinning from ear to ear. Riley reached into his jacket and pushed
a button, instantly Spike dropped to his knees clutching his forehead.
Riley grinned down at his sire's still human face and brandished a
stake, but the stake, and the hand holding it were shattered by a one
of Xander's high velocity messengers.</p>

<p>A second bullet took out the device and Spike stopped
clutching his head. Instead he kneeled on the floor and looked up at
his childe and growled. As the device was destroyed what few beasts
were left behind suddenly had the fight go out of them, but Riley was
not there to care as he jumped out the window and screamed at the
contact of sunlight as he tore up a man hole cover and disappeared
inside. The slayers ran out and were ready to dive inside until a
closely following Xander grabbed both of their shoulders and yanked
them back. They were about to yell at him when he pointed out a bulge
by the manhole that Riley had jumped over. He dropped his hands.
"Riley has the training and equipment to set up some nasty booby
traps, and I don't want to think what he'll have waiting in the
sewers. </p>

<p>Spike spoke up from the shadows of the building. "The weenie
is right!" Xander just leveled the assault rifle at Spike as the
vampire jumped back and held up his hands. The slayers nodded and they
both smiled at Xander as they thanked him. "I want to take this chance
to grab some gear, but it's a shock nobody has noticed the dead guard
yet. So we better get out of here soon." As they stepped back in the
building Spike was lighting another cigarette. "Nothing to worry about
there. Riley wanted the place to himself." All three darkened as they
looked at Spike. "Don't look at me. He sent his little friends out to
do the dirt while he re-fixed me." Buffy stepped close. "So Riley can
control demons?" Spike shrugged. "Not all of them pet. Just the ones
with the shiny new chips, a handful of which survived the big blow out
with the Initiative, but he DID pull out A LOT of equipment."</p>

<p>Buffy exhaled. "So he has the equipment to make himself a
demon army? Why didn't the Initiative do that?" Spike shrugged once
more. "He said something about getting more insight into the demon
mind." They all seemed to consider this, but Xander was the first to
recover. "I'm going to grab that gear." Willow's eyes suddenly went
wide. "I could try to find a manifest!" The redheaded hacker quickly
found a computer console and set to work. Faith looked around
dubiously. "Should we really be pawing everything? I mean they got
Spike's prints from that stake?" Buffy smiled. "The government has to
have us on files already, and Spike, well that's his problem." Spike
grimaced at the shorter slayer. "Great, now I am going to have to
break into ANOTHER damn lab. With my luck the fingerprint guy will
probably summon demons as a hobby."</p>

<p>They ignored the vampires whining as Xander returned with
several heavy olive drab bags. Both slayer's eyes got wide and Xander
grinned and shrugged. "Waste not want not." Buffy put her hands on her
hips. "And where do you plan on keeping all that?" Xander paused. "I'm
sure Giles will let me stash it with the rest of the weapons." Buffy
and Faith both smirked and nodded dubiously as all four of them walked
over to where Willow was working. She looked up as they approached. "I
have the Initiative manifest, but we will have to guess what he took."
Spike took a deep drag off of his cigarette. "Probably all of it.
There was three trucks worth of stuff." Buffy nodded her expression
back to a steely mask. "All right, let's go." As they opened the door
Spike looked out at the last rays of day and then gave Buffy a pointed
look. Faith shrugged and pulled a tarp off of one of the vehicles.</p>

<p>Spike looked down at where it landed when Faith tossed it at
his feet. He grumbled while he threw his cigarette and stepped on it.
"Thanks." Faith grinned. "Welcome." Spike then picked up the tarp and
draped it over his head while he followed them all out to the car. He
originally reclined on the passenger seat but had to sit up when
Xander got in the car after storing the munitions in the vehicle's
trunk. The three girls elected to sit in the back while Xander took
the wheel. Faith was at one window and Buffy was at the other so both
slayers could keep their enhanced senses on the look out for police or
military forces investigating the base. Willow was sandwiched between
the two girls, but did not seem to notice because a silence had fallen
over the entire group and remained until they made their way back to
the mansion.</p>

<p>By the time night had fallen and they were all able to get out
of the car. Spike simply tossed the tarp onto the ground, but at the
questioning glances of the two slayers he picked it back up and was
about to stuff it back inside the car. Xander stopped him, as the
munitions were unloaded. Xander got Faith's attention while they were
doing so. "Faith? You think I could stash this stuff inside the
mansion?" The dark slayer looked a bit wary as she eyed the military
equipment, but she eventually did nod. "Just put it in an unused part
and make SURE it's packed safe." Xander looked offended, but he
nodded. He then took the tarp from Spike and laid it with the pile of
gear. </p>

<p>When they entered the mansion only Anya was there and she was
able to read the looks on their faces, especially Spike's. "Why do you
have Spike and not Riley? Did he manage to turn the chip back on?"
Spike scowled at the former demon as Buffy spoke. "Yeah, where's Giles
and Tara?" Anya shrugged. "They went to the police station to look for
photos of Spike." Spike laughed as he took a seat. "Well unless they
have records going back a couple centuries they're wasting their
time." Buffy crossed her arms over her chest. "They are dealing with
the police because YOU charged into a hospital." Spike shrugged. "Be
happy I didn't kill anyone." Buffy narrowed her eyes at him. "Except
Riley." Spike threw his head back and sighed. "Oh come on slayer! I
did you a favor. You think Mr. All American would let his wife have a
career of her own?"</p>

<p>She stomped to stand right in front of him. "He was working
with me while you were working with Adam." Spike lifted his head back
up and grinned at her. "What? You trying to lay a guilt trip on me?
For that to work I'd have to have a conscience, and come on, your much
happier with the wild cat." The wild cat in question stepped up next
to Buffy's side and took her hand. "Still, you didn't have to kill
him." Spike shrugged. "Fish swim, birds fly, vampires kill. He's the
one who took the cuffs off." Xander had carried the gear into an
unused room and laid the tarp over it before coming back to the living
room. "Perhaps we should return the favor?" Spike rolled his eyes at
him. "Come on. If I remember right you were saying he was evil before
anyone else."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but turning him made him all the worse." Anya then
picked the moment to wrap her arms around Xander's elbow and spoke to
him quietly. "Umm… did you manage to snag a military uniform?" She
pouted as he shook his head and Spike smirked at the exchange. "All
right, I admit turning him was a mistake. Now lets all just move on."
Before they could move on sirens blared and 4 police cars screamed up
to the mansion. Spike was already moving as Buffy spoke to him.
"Spike! Hide!" A second later there was pounding on the door. "Miss.
Pryce! Come to the door or we are coming in!" Faith had gotten as pale
as any bed sheet as she walked to the door and opened it. The police
officer had his sidearm drawn as he and several others charged into
the room. "Miss. Pryce, is he here?" They all blinked as Faith
stammered. "Who? Is who here?" </p>

<p>The officers were fanning out to each person, and the Scoobies
were getting nervous. "Riley Finn or the man who attacked him. "You're
safe now. If they are here just tell us." The officers had pulled the
Scoobies up and were getting them out of the house as Faith shouted.
"No! It's ok. We're the only ones here. I mean it." The officers
stopped herding everyone to the door as Faith took a calming breath.
"We just woke up and Anya told us the Giles and Tara had went to the
station." The officers had dropped the weapons to hang at their sides
as the first officer began speaking again. "They never made it to the
station. The squad car was found with the officers killed and your
friends missing. We were afraid they would come here next." They were
all coming down from the shock of the police storming the house as the
cops starting holstering their weapons. "Still, we could protect you
better at the station."</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. "No, no, we just want to stay here, ok."
The officer looked dubious, but his expression also said he knew that
he couldn't force the issue. "Ok, but I want to station two squad
cars. We are dealing with a cop killer who seems determined to get
you." Faith nodded. "That would be great, thank you." The two groups
just seemed to stare at each other, but more as a matter of lingering
adrenaline then any antagonism. Faith kept nodding as she followed
them to the door. "Thank you officer." He nodded as well. "We'll be
right outside your door." She continued to nod. "Thank you." He
slipped out and Faith shut, and locked the door behind him. She then
turned around and slumped against it as Buffy walked over and pulled
her into a hug. "I was so scared Buffy, I thought it was going to
happen all over again."</p>

<p>Buffy smoothed the brunette's wild hair, while Faith didn't
say it they all knew she feared being in trouble with the law again.
Vampires were one thing, but the police were every where, and couldn't
just be killed like the undead, because for every one killed a hundred
started looking for you. Xander sat back down. "I guess that now that
the mayor and the Initiative are gone police are finally getting a
clue." Faith looked up with confusion on her face. While Mayor Wilkins
had been evil the fact was that if he didn't tamper with evidence she
would be in prison. Of course most of her murders were committed at
his command, so maybe it was only fair. She shrugged off the dark
thoughts as she stood up, but she kept contact with Buffy by holding
the other slayer's hand.</p>

<p>That was the moment Spike stuck his head out. "Well this is
bloody perfect. Guess I have more days and night of being locked in
the crypt. The days I don't mind, obviously but the nights are not
going to be pleasant." Buffy looked at Spike. "Just want do you DO all
day?" Spike saw the little smirk tugging at the slayer's face. "Shut
up! Let's see you have to spend the entire day inside under the fear
of a blistering, burning death." Anya then spoke up. "You should get
cable." Spike rolled his eyes. "I doubt they'd be willing to send an
installer out." Willow then spoke up, though her pallor, and the way
she seemed to mumble, made everyone fear she was in shock. "What about
a satellite system?" Spike's eyebrows arched. "Heyyyyy that's not a
bad idea." Buffy stepped forward, but she pulled Faith with her as she
kept her grip on the dark slayer's hand. "Ok, I think we have more
important things to discuss right now then Spike's TV watching
habits."</p>

<p>Buffy Summers felt strong hands massaging her shoulders. "You
know, while I'm glad to be one of the Scoobies again. I am now glad
you were the first called." Buffy smirked at Faith over her shoulder.
"Why is that?" Faith smirked. "All I have to do is break things. No
weighty decisions or stuff like that. Well break things, and give our
beloved slayer back rubs. Which reminds me, aren't you supposed to the
be one giving me a back rub?" Buffy laughed. "I'll owe ya two. Faith?
Do you think Spike is right? Do you think Riley isn't going to turn
Giles and Tara?" Faith's face mirrored the sad look on Buffy's face as
she rested her hands on the blonde's neck. "I don't know. I want to
think that, and Spike did make sense. I mean Riley probably would have
sent them against us already if he did, and the fact that after Spike
turned him we would be expecting it. So they would be more valuable
alive as hostages."</p>

<p>Buffy turned around and nuzzled into Faith's arms, silently
seeking comfort that Faith willingly gave. While she didn't turn
around she did raise and turn her head as Xander and Anya came back in
the room. "How's Willow?" Xander shook his head. "Terrified, but
sleeping. Buffy we got to get them back." Buffy then turned around in
Faith's arms. "We will. Spike already volunteered to go scouting."
Xander's expression looked dubious. "You really think we can trust
him?" Buffy nodded. "He hates Riley about as much as Angel hates him."
Xander smirked. "A virtual tradition. Reminds me of my family. Except
with out the biting, snarling demon thing… well with out the demon
part." They all grinned slightly as Buffy closed and then reopened her
eyes while Faith massaged her scalp. "We'll need to fool the cops
though. Anya sighed. "I'll stay here and say you guys went to sleep if
anything happens."</p>

<p>Xander smiled and gave Anya a kiss, which left the girl
looking both happy and surprised while he started speaking. "Think we
will be able to sneak past them?" Anya then spoke again. "I'll make a
big issue about going to bed so their attention will be here." This
time she was surprised, but happy as they all smiled at her, Buffy
then speaking. "Thanks Anya. Ok, we will wait an hour for Spike to get
back. Then either way we sneak out. Let's get ready." Xander got up
and started walking towards the make shift armory he had set up. All
three girls looked skeptical and he noticed and grinned. "Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing." Something that didn't seem to comfort them at
all. If anything it had the opposite effect. </p>

<p>He emerged about ten minutes later while Buffy and Faith were
picking out various hand to hand weapons. He carried several bundles
to the coffee table, a ugly looking little machine gun with a dozen of
it's curved clips, a handgun with 8 clips, an assortment of mundane
things like a small flash light, a miniature first aid kit, and
similar items. It was when he took out a gleaming combat knife Faith's
eyes shot up. "Ohhhhhhhhh, shiny. Got any more?" Xander shook his
head. "Sorry, just grabbed one guys worth." Faith seemed to be pouting
as Buffy walked over to examine Xander's personal arsenal. "You mean
all that is just for one guy?" Xander nodded. "It may seem a lot, but
not everyone was blessed with superpowers. Hopefully this will help
even the playing field a bit."</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith both seemed dubious at his words and were
ready to speak, but he beat them to it. "I know, I know, just don't
shoot you guys." Both girls grinned at him, and then found themselves
slightly startled at the cool expression on his face as he started
taking the guns apart, cleaning them, oiling them, and putting them
back together. They had sat down to go through a far more antiquated
weapon assortment. By the time that the hour was up Spike had yet to
return and they were done with waiting. Faith had selected an
assortment of knives for her personal weapons and had secreted them on
her person. Buffy had selected a Roman short sword, she thought Giles
had called it a gladius, but all that mattered to her was that it was
both long enough to inflict sufficient damage, yet short enough to be
swung quickly and easily, and concealed under a light coat. Both girls
had also taken an assortment of wooden stakes, as had Xander. His
personal weaponry was far more diverse however, the collection held to
his chest with a black nylon rig.</p>

<p>Xander had also concealed his gear under a windbreaker, which
then left the trio looking like little more then three young people
out for a walk. Or at least they hoped as much when Xander kissed Anya
goodbye and moved to the side of the house farthest from where the
cops were currently positioned. As the sounds of Anya getting ready
for bed drifted down to them they all allowed a grin as Faith then
opened the window and slid out. Following right behind her Buffy
touched down on the grass, and then Xander, though with a thud
compared to the whispering movements of the slayers. Once he was on
the ground however he was able to keep quiet and the path that the two
slayers led him along was free of the various debris that could give
them away.</p>

<p>Once they had gotten a block away from the house they had
walked onto the street and except for keeping an eye out for patrol
cars they were able to move freely. Xander looked at the girls. "Ok,
were out. Now what?" Buffy looked between the two of them as Faith
also looked at Buffy for direction. "All right, all we have right now
is old haunts. We probably shouldn't swing by his dorm since it's a
crime scene. So lets find the access door Spike used to lead us into
the Initiative when we rescued Oz. The other two seemed to nod; though
Faith looked like she was simply willing to follow their lead. Which
Buffy proceeded to do as She stepped to the front and started walking.
When they had reached the wooded area they knew they had hit the
jackpot because they had seen several military trucks. Of course it
might not be the jackpot they had been looking for so they started
creeping forward to examine the trucks closer.</p>

<p>That was interrupted as hand grabbed Buffy and pulled her back
to the shadows. Hands that quickly fell away as Faith slid in the
space between the two figures and slammed her palm into the other
figure's chin hard enough to shatter teeth as the jaw slammed upward.
At least it would have if the person were mortal. Spike was glaring at
all of them as he held his hand to his jaw, but the three took the
hint and slipped into shadows. As they did Xander holstered the Colt
45 handgun he had drawn. Spike was testing his jaw and still glaring
at the dark slayer as he started to whisper. "Couldn't wait could ya?
Fine! He's in there, been using some of the bigger demons as
excavation gear. Apparently the Initiative had emptied the place out
and then filled it in with concrete."</p>

<p>Buffy chewed her bottom lip. "Ok, we don't need a replay of
last year. So we need to stop him now." They all nodded as they
continued. "Any indicator of how many in there?" Spike shook his head.
"I only see smaller demons coming out and loading concrete into one of
the trucks they emptied out." "Ok, so two of the trucks are still
filled with equipment?" Xander spoke up then. "I knew we would be
dealing with trucks. So I have charges that could destroy them if I
rig it between the fuel tank and cargo area." They all looked at him
as Faith spoke. "Why between?" Xander started at her. "I don't care
about the front of the truck, I want to make sure I blow up the
equipment in the back, putting the charge there will ignite the tank
while still concentrating on the cargo area."</p>

<p>They all nodded appreciatively at that as Buffy then spoke.
"Ok Xander, you go set the charges and Spike you cover him." The
vampire seemed ready to object but looked at the faces of those
assembled and nodded. "Xander, can you set them up to explode about
five minutes after we enter?" He nodded. "I'll set the timers for
eight minutes and Spike and I will meet you two after they are set."
Buffy nodded. "Ok we go in from there. If we see any stragglers we
kill them, then move in and find Riley." While in the planning stage
Buffy didn't seem to realize what they would do with Riley once they
found him, and while Xander and Spike didn't realize it Faith did, and
she made a note to herself to keep an eye on the smaller slayer.
Quietly Spike and Xander slipped from where they were hiding and moved
towards where the two trucks were parked. The third truck was missing,
but Spike had told them it was just off dumping concrete.</p>

<p>They were all unsure about trusting the vampire, but the
situation as it was left them needing his help. Faith still had a
stake with his name on it, but kept it tucked away. When the two had
gotten almost all the way to the trucks the two slayers slipped out
themselves and made their way above the entrance. It was somewhat set
into the ground so they were able to get an elevated spot above the
entryway. They hoped that the fact the truck was away would keep the
demons from discovering them early, but Buffy had drawn her short
sword and Faith had a knife in hand. When the men arrived from their
mission of destruction Spike looked almost nonchalant while Xander
seemed the exact opposite as he had a Heckler and Koch submachine gun
to his shoulder with the folding stock extended, but his finger
outside the guard. They both seemed to be looking around for the
slayers and as the two dropped down in front of them Spike jumped into
a defensive position while Xander slipped his finger inside the
trigger guard and on the trigger.</p>

<p>Both men quickly relaxed as they recognized the slayers and
then all four fell silent as Spike stepped forward and opened the
doorway. Buffy and Faith moved up to take the lead, but Xander stopped
them. They first looked at him quizzically but he silently took out
his handgun and handed it to spike with a questioning expression. The
vampire seemed to consider and then nodded as he took the weapon
handed him. Xander then motioned him to one side of the hallway while
he took the other. He then made hand gestures to the two slayers that
seemed to say he and Spike would shoot, then stop, then they would
charge forward. The girls and Spike nodded as they all waited. Three
minutes later the exploding trucks seemed to send out a rush of air
that made their ears pop even as they heard the muffled rumble.</p>

<p>The demons seemed to hear it too as they came down the
hallway. "Fire!" Xander opened up with short bursts that he moved from
left to right as he cut down demon after demon. Spike was on the right
and moved to the left with single shots that seemed to take down their
targets with alarming precision. As the two men stopped firing the
slayers ran forward and were able to easily finish the few demons that
had survived the lethal strafing. Spike twirled the gun in his hand
and handed it handle first to Xander. At the questioning look he
smirked. "I prefer my hands, but in the old west that just meant I got
shot a lot." Xander smiled and nodded as he reloaded both weapons and
put the pistol back in it's holster. The submachine gun was back to
his shoulder and tracking as they all began moving out again. Though
this time they all seemed more comfortable with Xander's being armed.</p>

<p>They stopped when they made it to the main bay where demons
were inspected, dissected and experimented on. While the majority of
the room was hidden behind a jagged wall of concrete the sheer mass of
progress Riley had made in just under a day had amazed all of them.
Xander was the first to put it to wards however. "At this rate he
could have this place unearthed in a week." It was then both the
slayers and the vampire heard a sound that they had heard only moments
ago a Xander had reloaded his submachine gun, the sound of a bolt
being slid back. Buffy was the one to shout it out. "Get down!" The
warning was nearly lost in the clatter of automatic weapons fire.</p>
