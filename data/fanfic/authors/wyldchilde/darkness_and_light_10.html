<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 10 -->

<p>"You keeping up Faith?" "Look around little slayer, I'm ahead
of you." What had started out as a jog around Sunnydale's vampire hot
spots and turned into a footrace. Somehow they knew that Spike would
not remain still on his first night back in full control of his
actions, and neither were they. Yet Spike seemed to dwindle in their
minds as they allowed themselves to get lost in the night. Hearing
only their footsteps and their breathing, everything else was quiet
around them. It was as if the night new that predators were about, but
not the predators she was used to. These were the hunters of hunters,
the predators of predators. Yet the night also seemed to welcome them,
wrap around them, cloak them as she did all of her denizens. Night
being just an observer in the contest. </p>

<p>They felt buoyant, light, and yet utterly aware. The very
texture of night lifting them like a bird on the wing, a falcon on the
hunt. Faith turned her head to see her partner's response, but only
saw a blonde blur hurtling towards her, and driving her towards a
patch of grass. She landed on her back and attempted to roll, but
found she was pinned by knees at each of her hips and strong thighs
that pressed on her to keep her immobile. "I guess I win?" Buffy's
chest was heaving from the run, and something more. Her eyes were wide
and dark as she leaned over Faith. While Buffy's hair hung over her
face like a mane Faith's was spread out like a halo. Buffy leaned over
further, examining Faith's face, and she even seemed to be sniffing
her. Yet Faith was arching her shoulders to do the same.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Faith's voice was dry, breathless. "What's
happening?" Buffy shook her head. "I don't know, but I like it." At
that point Faith's head shot up to capture Buffy's lips and they were
taken. Both women kissing, pressing, and purring? They both wondered
what had come over them, but deep down they didn't care, the self
delusions, the illusions, the fronts they put on for others were
suddenly stripped away. Faith had risen to a sitting position and
taken Buffy with her when they both smelled it, blood, human, and a
lot of it. While they broke the embrace on some level they never lost
contact. Both of them slipping into the shadows and stealthily
approaching the source of the scent.</p>

<p>When they recognized the familiar landscape of the Sunnydale
university Buffy darkened. The choice of locales was deliberate; Spike
was hunting on her territory. She tried to think who would be easily
accessible in the early morning, and Buffy silently led Faith to the
janitorial closet. They didn't need to go to the closet because they
found the janitors cart, with its materials strewn about it and it's
owner lain out on top of it. Like some post modern altar its bloody
sacrifice's throat lay open, but both were familiar enough with
vampires to know that no sacrificial blade had made the wound. They
recognized it as a vampire "playing with their food". Some vampires
would not settle for their fangs puncture wounds and would instead
gnaw at the opening and tear it open wide, both to increase their
victims suffering and gorge on the jetting blood, or as Buffy had
called it "slamming a person".</p>

<p>As they both lean in to examine the corpse they saw its dead
hands gain new life as it grabbed each of them by the hair. They could
both see it's game face as Buffy brought her forearm across the
vampire's and it's hands jarred lose. She continued the action as she
grabbed onto its wrists and pulled them above its head. The vampire's
struggles were shaking more cleaning products free, and as Faith
staked it the struggles continued as it shook its own ashes free. The
near by janitors closet splintered as it burst from it's hinges and
four more newly sired undead stepped out. Buffy was the first to meet
the attack as she ran forward and drove her shoulder into the
midsection of the first vampire out the door. Balled fists attempted
to smash down on Buffy's back in a crude axe handle but she had
already drawn back enough to employ her stake and all that crashed
down on her was the soot that marked another passing of one of the
undead.</p>

<p>Faith had followed right behind Buffy, but she instead kicked
what little there was left of the door back closed, and when the third
vampire reached his midsection through the shattered area she grabbed
him by the shoulders and forced him down on a shard of wood that
impaled his heart and destroyed him. The second vampire managed to
connect with the back of her head, which stole her equilibrium. When
she heard Buffy move to fight she dropped prone and rolled out of the
way, but before she could spring back to her feet the fourth and final
vampire burst through the remains of the door and tried to attack
Buffy. The older slayer didn't even have time to recognize the threat
before Faith swept the creatures legs and laid the creature flat on
it's back.  She got back to her feet in the same motion that she drove
her stake into the second vampire's chest while Buffy simultaneously
drove her stake into the heart of the last vampire.</p>

<p>The two were looking at each other with disbelief. The fight
had provided some twisted sort of release and now they were both clear
headed and thinking. Even newly sired, five vampires should have left
them more winded then this. Faith looked at Buffy. "Like or not, I
think we need to figure out what's happening." Buffy nodded. "I don't
get it. When did Spike need a cleaning service?" Faith rolled her eyes
and then they both paused and spoke as one. "The only other thing
would be he needed shock troops to play a diversion." "Hellmouth?"
Buffy shook her head. "He doesn't want to end the world, just us." Her
eyes went wide and Faiths did as well. "Scoobies?… Hospital!"  The two
ran for the exit.</p>

<p>The night swallowed them once more, as they ran no longer a
race they ran through the Sunnydale streets. The night was no longer
holding sway as the earliest risers were starting to peek their heads
back into the outside world. Yet even as they did they chose to ignore
the two girls with the determined eyes and break neck pace. As they
turned the corner they saw the hospital, and the flashing red and blue
lights from both the hospital's own ambulances and from the squad cars
of the Sunnydale PD. The smell of newly spilled blood reached their
nostrils and in a magic trick worthy of the finest magician their
stakes appeared in hand. They immediately put them back into
concealment as they tried to slip around to another entrance. While
they managed to find another way in they still were unable to avoid
the police. "I'm sorry ladies, but this is a crime scene. The hospital
has converted the main entrance into an emergency room until we finish
our investigation."</p>

<p>Buffy was about to speak, but Faith beat her to the punch.
"But I know a guy in there. He got stabbed on my friends property."
The cop's expression seemed to grow sad. "Riley Finn?" With out
thinking both girls nodded. "Well, who ever stabbed him must have come
back to finish the job. He was dragged out of here not over an hour
ago." Buffy then spoke before Faith was able to. "By who?" Though she
already knew the answer. "Some pale blonde guy. Right now we are
thinking some radical race group because both fit the white Aryan male
image. The attacker was described as inhumanly strong, with a scarred
up face. We think he was hopped up on PCP or something similar. Are
you friends with a "Rupert Giles"?" The girls both nodded. "He's being
questioned in the make shift ER while he's being tended to." He saw
they both looked scared at that fact and shook his head. "Don't worry,
just some bumps and bruises when he and your friends tried to keep Mr.
Finn from getting taken."</p>

<p>The cop then pointed to a sign that had been set up to give
directions. "You'd girls best get home and lock your doors. If you
want a police escort just ask the officer present." They walked away,
both looking confused, Buffy being the first to speak. "Now that was
an almost pleasant conversation." Faith nodded. "With a cop." "Think
we've been going about it all wrong?" Faith shrugged. "Cops are people
to." Buffy looked at her sharply and Faith continued as they walked.
"Well most people are assholes, and so are cops, but most of the time
let them do their jobs and they'll leave you alone." They nodded and
walked quickly towards the temporary ER. "Buffy." Buffy pulled Faith
to a stop and smiled at her. "Faith, I was thinking about my feelings
for you before I ever… well, mounted you."</p>

<p>While they both blushed Faith looked uncomfortable. "Yeah, but
I was the one who came up with the whole hungry and horny thing."
Buffy stepped close to her and looked into her face silently until
Faith met her eyes. "Yes, but being a slayer is part of me, and now
I'm realizing that you are too." Faith blushed and tried to look away,
but Buffy managed to catch her with a warm, tender kiss on the lips.
As the kiss broke they resumed walking and Buffy resumed speaking.
"It's not that you don't get me… well horny, but it goes far deeper."
She reached out and took Faith's hand as Faith began to speak. "What
if at least part of it is because we are both slayers?" Buffy
shrugged. "I guess we'll just have to struggle on and carry that
burden." Buffy was grinning and it caused Faith to grin as well.
"Struggle or snuggle?" Buffy laughed. "Either way."</p>
