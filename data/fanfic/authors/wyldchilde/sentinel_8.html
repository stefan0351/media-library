<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 8 -->

<p>"You sure you're ok?" Buffy's expression was tired, but it
carried a hint of a smile. "Yeah, I'm ok." They were both silent then,
and as the silence remained it grew more and more uncomfortable until
Buffy finally decided to break it. "So when were you going to tell
me?" Angel was obviously confused at that. "Tell you what?" Her
features were sad, but softened and her reply was almost a whisper.
"About the prophecy." His eyes got wide and he seemed to get even
paler, he seemed capable of speaking only one word. "How?" Buffy shook
her head. "The Host let it slip. He didn't realize that I didn't
know." Angel turned away at that, and even though she couldn't see his
face she could see that he seemed tired, his body sagging where it
stood. "Angel? Why didn't you tell me?" He turned around slowly.
"Because." She started to narrow her eyes, but she could see he was
trying to find the words to express himself.</p>

<p>"Because I didn't just loose you, I had to leave you. For both
our sakes, and if this turned out to be wrong… I couldn't go through
that again." Buffy took a ragged breath, and then another and another,
each one getting steadier and stronger. "It's not like that Angel, not
anymore. I'm with Faith." He met her eyes and saw how peaceful she was
as she said it. He knew there was no way he could conceal his pain so
he closed his eyes tightly. While he didn't realize it he had started
shaking, but Buffy had and she responded by wrapping her arms around
him. He didn't even struggle as he breathed in the scent of her and
finally let silent tears fall. For her part she stood there silently
and actually rocked the 200-year-old vampire gently. He was the one to
stop the motion and pull away. When their eyes met again Buffy
whispered. "I'm sorry Angel. I'm not sorry I love Faith, but I'm sorry
you're hurting."</p>

<p>He shook his head and whispered as well. "That has nothing to
do with you." She shook her head and seemed ready to contradict him,
but he interrupted. "I'm sure she's waiting for you." Buffy had
already taken a breath, which she let out and then paused. Taking
another breath she spoke again. "Please, try to be happy Angel. I am."
She turned and slowly walked out. After she had disappeared into the
elevator he slid down into his chair and spoke to the empty office.
"But I can't." Even with her slayer hearing Buffy could not hear him
from her position at the door to the honeymoon suite. Letting herself
into the darkened room she smiled as she saw Faith sleeping on the
bed. While Faith was now able to sleep soundly through the night she
seemed to be restless right now; the look on her face was like she was
concentrating. Buffy knew that it was because she was missing the
feeling of her fellow slayer lying there next to her. Of course Buffy
knew full well that she was a cuddler and so she usually ended up on
top of Faith was much as she did next to her.</p>

<p>The smile was still on her face as she reached out and
caressed Faith's cheek. The action seemed to soothe Faith and her
expression showed it. Buffy's smile grew and she leaned in to kiss
Faith on the forehead. That woke Faith up and as she pulled back Faith
was looking up at her and blinking. "Hey." Buffy brushed a lock of
Faith's hair back. "Hey." Faith smiled shyly at Buffy's gentle touch
and then her expression sobered. "So how'd it go?" Buffy frowned and
laid down, resting her head on Faith's shoulder and Faith put an arm
up and on Buffy's shoulders. "Not great. He's hurting so much Faith."
She felt Faith nuzzle her hair and kiss the top of her head. "Nothing
you can do about that B." Buffy sat up, but her head hung down. "Is
that supposed to help?" Faith put her hand on Buffy's knee. "Like I
said, nothing that can be done about that. He loves you, and there's
no way to change that." Buffy's guilt was obvious on her face and
Faith shook her knee. "Hey, that's not your fault. I mean wasn't it
SEEING you that got him fighting evil in the first place?"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded slowly as Faith continued. "So he had a choice B.
He had that point where he fell in love with you sure, but he had the
point where he had to act on it." Buffy smirked at Faith. "When did
you get so wise?" Faith grinned and laid back into the blankets. "Part
of the whole redemption thing. When I started to understand why I did
what I did I kinda got an idea why others do what they do." Buffy
nodded, but even as she did her eyes were lidded. Faith pulled back
the covers, exposing how she was sleeping in her normal style, and
patted the bed next to her. "Come on, you look wiped out." Buffy
continued to nod. "Probably because I am, but I'm going to go take a
quick shower." Faith spoke to Buffy's back as she was walking into the
bathroom. "Want some help?" Buffy just laughed as she started getting
undressed. While it was probably because her mother raised her that
way Buffy didn't think about it as she folded the clothes she was
taking off. Then she saw where Faith had tossed all her dirty clothes
into a separate pile and flipped her folded ones in there to join
them.</p>

<p>As the warm spray of water hit her face and soaked into her
hair she let out a groan. She accented the groan by stretching her
muscles, while her slayer healing had taken care of any bruising her
muscles had been tensed up with the fight, and then with the whole
deal with Angel. She had been able to start unwinding when she got
back to their room, and now under the nozzle of the shower she was
finally able to relax all those muscles she hadn't even realized were
tensed up. She grabbed the shampoo with one hand and uncapped it with
the same putting some in her other hand she started lathering up her
hair and really thought about what Faith said. Not just then either,
she remembered soon after Riley had been turned Faith had said
something similar, about how the people in Buffy's life had made their
own decisions and Buffy couldn't hold herself responsible for them. In
Riley's case he had enlisted in the Army and signed on with the
Initiative long before he ever met Buffy Anne Summers.</p>

<p>Of course he might not have been given any choice in joining
the Initiative, but the fact was he was dealing with demons long
before he ever met a certain slayer. The problem with that idea was
that he didn't get turned until after he had left the Initiative
entirely. Not until after he left and then decided to recruit a demon
to murder the one he thought was his competition for Buffy's
affections. Ironically it was his own actions that pushed Buffy closer
to Faith. Even with the dark topic Buffy couldn't hide her smile.
Thinking about Faith always did that to her, and when she thought
about Faith, about her dark reflection she realized that she and Faith
had already been close. All the Riley did was force them to rebuild
that bridge a little faster. Then there was Faith, slayer, lover,
natural disaster, she tore into Buffy's world like a hurricane and
Buffy ran for the nearest shelter she could find, but what if? What if
Buffy had just seen those dark clouds gathering, seeing that downward
spiral… actually she had, but her idea of dealing with it was treating
Faith like dirt. Probably like everyone in her life had treated her.</p>

<p>Buffy had been action on autopilot, lathering up and rinsing
off as she sighed. She knew that if Faith knew what she was thinking
about she would probably grab Buffy by the shoulders and give her a
good hard shake. That or pull Buffy in an embrace and cover her lips
with kisses that left Buffy with no doubt about Faith's feelings. She
had failed Faith, and Faith had failed her. Of course she never
thought about what Faith did because she was too busy hating herself
for… She suddenly realized there was nothing left for her to wash so
she settled for a quick rinsing to make sure all the soap was gone.
Then she turned off the water and grabbed the towel. She dried herself
in front of the mirror and looked closely at her reflection. Older,
wiser, a lot more mature, there was a certain hardness around the
eyes, but being the slayer will do that to you. Then she remembered
when it was Faith's reflection staring back at her. That was the point
Buffy didn't come down from her high horse, it was knocked out from
underneath her. It was one thing for Buffy to take the moral high
ground when she had the friends, the family, the life.</p>

<p>Yet again when faced with the screaming dose of reality named
Faith, Buffy again ran and hid. This time behind a wall of anger and
righteous indignation, all the while refusing to consider why her
fellow slayer was able to get under her skin in a way that it took
Angelus to do. If Angel hadn't helped Faith find herself Buffy
probably never would have gotten over herself and went to her grave
never knowing why she always felt empty. Angel had completed her for a
time, and even Angelus couldn't destroy that, but Angel could. He knew
that he had to earn the right to happiness and Buffy was more than he
deserved. As she started brushing out her hair she closed her eyes.
Angel had made that choice, Buffy would have done anything to be with
him, to keep him in her life. In a way sharing his curse with him, but
Angel would never allow that. It still didn't change that he made the
choice to leave. The thought gave Buffy a sense of resolution, and the
feeling a weight had been lifted. Once that weight lifted the more
familiar feeling of fatigue pulled down on her.</p>

<p>Now dry she padded back into the bedroom naked. Faith looked
up as Buffy walked in. While she pulled back the covers Buffy climbed
in and lay back against Faith's chest. As Buffy let out a contented
sigh Faith spoke. "You've been thinking again haven't you?" Buffy
looked up at Faith. "How could you tell?" Faith grinned and kissed
Buffy's forehead. "You have your drama scowl." Buffy arched both her
eyebrows. "My drama scowl?" Faith nodded. "Yes it's the expression you
get when you're having all those deep, moody thoughts." "Well one of
us has to be the thinker." Faith chuckled as she pulled the covers up
higher and eased them both down to rest on the pillows. "I'll leave
that to you then ok?" Buffy was already falling asleep as she replied.
"Kay." "Love you B." Buffy's eyes were already drifting closed as she
replied. "Love you too Faith."</p>

<p>When her eyes opened again she sat bolt upright and clutched
the blankets to her chest. "Spike! What are you doing here?" The
vampire had seemed dazed. "Are you naked under there?" Buffy then felt
the blankets rustle as Faith lifted the blanket enough to peek her
head underneath. She then looked up at Spike and nodded. Buffy glared
at Faith, and then at Spike. "Spike? Was there anything you had to say
before I staked you?" "Oh, right. Well, Gunn's back and he's found us
a place to start digging. So we're all getting ready." Her shoulders
slumped as she nodded. In the meanwhile Faith had already climbed out
of bed and was picking out her clothes. Buffy shouted at Spike. "Turn
around!" Faith smirked back at her partner. "Chill B. It's nothing he
hasn't seen before." Spike smirked back at the dark slayer but then he
turned around and Buffy slipped from the covers and grabbed clothes,
though she seemed more rushed then Faith did. </p>

<p>Finally they slayers were dressed and followed the vampire out
to the main hall. As they walked down the stairs Buffy whispered to
Faith. "Do I want to know?" Faith turned to her. "Don't worry B. I'd
never cheat on you." Buffy smiled. "I know that." Faith smiled back,
and then lost the smile. "It was back when Riley turned off his chip
outside the mansion." Buffy frowned slightly too, but instead of
pulling away from Faith she stepped a little closer. When they got to
the hall they saw Angel and Gunn, Giles, Willow and Tara. Angel was
the first to notice them. "Buffy, Gunn's found us a site we can use to
burrow into the offices." He then seemed to step back to allow Gunn to
speak, which he did. "All right, most of the property around Wolfram
and Heart is owned by Wolfram and Heart, but I found a burned out
warehouse that the cops thought was a torch job. They were blaming the
owner, but he was blaming someone else." Buffy finished for him.
"Wolfram and Heart." "Check it. Seems the warehouse was in this guy's
family for generations and he straight up refused to sell to the
lawyers. All of a sudden he takes out a big insurance claim and the
place goes up in smoke. But the problem is HE never took out the
claim."</p>

<p>Faith seemed confused at that. "Well why didn't they just
torch the place?" Angel answered the question. "Probably because they
want him in jail, or at least tied up in defending himself from a
arson charge. Otherwise he might try to rebuild. Or even just let the
burned out warehouse sit there." Faith then started nodding. "But if
he's in jail he won't have much chance of holding on to the land."
Gunn nodded. "Right. So when I told him we were out to the firm dirty
he said we could have the place to ourselves. Even offered to let us
use the equipment he brought in for demolishing the place." Giles was
smiling. "So their double dealings…" Gunn finished for the Englishman.
"Are coming round to bite em on the ass." Giles didn't seem entirely
comfortable with the choice of words, but nodded nonetheless. Buffy
then clapped her hands together once. "All right, lets get Xander,
Anya, Cordy and Wesley and let's get going." Faith nodded. "I'll got
get Xander and Anya." Angel then spoke. "I'll page Wes and Cordy and
tell them where to meet us."</p>

<p>Faith couldn't help but smirk as she strolled to Xander and
Anya's room. She reached for the handle then paused. Laughing quietly
to herself she knocked and then walked in. When she got in she could
see Xander and Anya were in the process of waking up, while she smiled
at them they blinked at her. Smiling brightly she continued. "Xander,
Anya." She allowed her smile to slip away. "Gunn found us a place to
start digging. Get dressed and lets get going." She then turned around
to leave but heard Anya speak to Xander. "Xander? Was she trying to
catch us having sex?" Faith couldn't see it but Xander was shaking his
head. "No, I'm sure she just wanted to let us know it was time to wake
up." Faith figured Anya could see the edges of her smirk because she
disagreed. "I think she was. I think she was trying to walk in on us
having sex!" Faith turned around, allowing her smirk to remain.
"That's not a problem is it?" Anya seemed to consider that and then
shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, it's all right. Xander is really good at sex… but I guess
you know that." Faith smiled. "Yeah." At which Xander blushed. "But
I'm a one woman, woman." Anya smiled and nodded. "So should Xander and
I walk in on you and Buffy having sex?" Faith's grin grew. "Well I
wouldn't mind, but B probably wouldn't like it." An even redder Xander
held up his hands. "Please, stop. Let's not go there… no matter how
pleasant the territory." Faith laughed. "All right. We're gathering in
the hall. So get your shit and lets get going." She then did turn and
leave. When she got back to the main hall Buffy saw her smirk and
arched a brow. "What did you do?" Faith's jaw dropped. "What? Why do
you assume I did something?" Instead of answering Buffy just kept
looking at her girlfriend from under her uplifted brow, but she did
have a small smile on her face and Faith got one as well. Faith just
settled for quietly walking up to Buffy and putting her arm around the
smaller slayer's waist. </p>

<p>Out in the main hall the group was gathered except for the
just woken Xander and Anya and Wesley and Cordelia who were going to
meet them there. Angel looked around and stepped forward and Buffy did
the same. The two seemed to give each other a nod as Angel started
speaking. As he did so he gestured everyone to a map unrolled on the
counter but even after they gathered he took a few minutes so that
Xander and Anya were able to make it from their room. Once the group
was assembled he started. "Ok, our starting point is an area five
blocks from the Wolfram and Heart offices." As he pointed most of the
group seemed to groan except Angel, Buffy and Gunn. While he continued
Angel shook his head. "But we'll only have to dig through two of them.
The city has been installing new drainage systems for rainwater, and
since Wolfram and Heart is in an upscale area they got some of them
first. Now from what Gunn was able to gather and what Willow pulled
from the security system they haven't gotten the clout together to
start messing with city property."</p>

<p>Xander shook his head. "Doesn't mean they haven't." Angel
nodded, but Willow was the one to provide the answer. "I still didn't
find anything down there… security wise." Angel then did continue.
"Still, that's where you and you come in Xander, even if they don't
have anything set up I wouldn't be surprised if they had a few things
down there. You'll be looking for booby traps while Willow looks for
security devices. The biggest problem will be the space. The drains
are big enough to walk if you crouch over a bit, but there will be no
natural light." Xander paused. "You and Spike. I'll work with Spike
and you can work with Willow and you'll use the vampire night vision
to try to pick out anything we might miss." Angel nodded and Spike
shrugged. Angel then continued to point out various features on the
map as he kept speaking. "That will get us to their wall, but then we
have to find a way to get in undetected. We'll be able to get through
the wall, but the second we step inside they'll see us."</p>

<p>Willow was the one to shake her head at that. "I have a map of
their electrical system. We'll just burrow in at a junction point and
I can use the password I put in to shut them down." Xander looked
skeptical. "That didn't work too well last time Will. You'd probably
be better off having the cameras display old footage." Willow blushed
slightly, but nodded. Tara then spoke. "Then I could start searching
for the Sentinel because you have to figure he's putting off some
heavy magic." Angel nodded. "I can get you pointed in the general
direction since I only caught a glimpse on the run." Buffy surveyed
the group. "Ok, then let's get going. Since we all know the address
we'll go there separately, but you should probably go there first Gunn
so you can make sure things are all set." Gunn nodded once and started
to leave, but Angel stopped him.  "I'll go with you in case they're
already onto us." Gunn nodded at him and the two men left. Buffy then
turned to Giles. "Giles, you, Spike, Willow and Tara will take your
car and Faith Xander, Anya and me will take Spikes." Xander objected
to that as he walked behind the counter. "Forget that old rust bucket.
"Let's take Angel's." Buffy looked dubious as she started at the keys
in Xander's hand, but she kept silent.</p>
