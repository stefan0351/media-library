<p>"Hey Giles? What's "The Sentinel" besides a failed show from
UPN?" The Watcher turned to face Willow Rosenberg as he answered her
question. "The what?" She pointed at the book she was in the process
of scanning, and started reading a passage. "The Sentinel, the light's
guardian at the mouth of Hell until the end of days." He straightened
his glasses and moved to read over her shoulder as she continued. "I
mean since we live on the mouth of Hell and all I figured it might be
something we should know about." "What should we know about?" Both
Willow and Giles looked up abruptly at the appearance of the slayers.
Giles then looked at Buffy. "I believe you should learn how to knock."
She just grinned at him as the pair tried to squeeze in and see what
they were looking at.</p>

<p>He then took a breath. "Well, according to this book The
Sentinel is "A champion of light sent to stand guard at the gates of
Hell until the end of the world." Faith then spoke. "Well he must be
asleep at the wheel when you think about how many times we've had to
keep the Hellmouth from opening."  Giles shook his head as he
continued to read. "No, it says that the darkness learned of his
mission and fielded an army to stop him, yet "No claw, nor fang, nor
blade, nor burn could fell him." In the end they had to chain him up
and seal him in stone." Buffy scrunched in closer. "He kinda sounds
like The Judge." Giles shrugged. "Well perhaps he was his counter
part, a being of similar age and power. Either way I believe this
deserves more research. To start I believe we should go through the
books we managed to recover from Dracula's lair." Willow smiled.
"After Faith suggested it." Faith smirked. "Well I like to think of it
as a kinder, gentler version of "want, take, have" I mean it's my job
to dust them anyways. So I see no reason not to take their stuff.
Bastard should have known better then to try for my girl. No one
nibbles on B's neck but me."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Faith. "Yeah, yeah. Well he wasn't able to get
into the mansion, and Spike was a great help in tracking him down, and
between us we finished him off nicely." Willow then quirked her brow.
"Speaking of Spike, where is he?" Faith smirked once more. "Well when
I last saw him he was in the chick pit with the Brides of Dracula."
Giles gave Faith a surprised expression. "Didn't you help him?" Faith
laughed at that. "I believe his exact words were. "Bugger off, or I
swear chip or no I'll kill you." Buffy smiled. "Well I'll trust that
Spike will do the right thing, eventually. I'm more worried about
Xander, even as Dracula's "man-bitch" he was still pretty dangerous
with a gun." Willow was entering commands into her laptop computer as
she spoke. "I think he's ok. I mean he and Anya are already out
apartment hunting, and he's signed up for the guard." Buffy nodded.
"Still, let's try him anyway, if he brings Anya that's another set of
eyes."</p>

<p>Faith seemed to think. "Should we get Spike too?" Buffy nodded
once more. "Yeah, I mean Spike was one of those reassembling The
Judge, so he might know something, and even if he doesn't he is
another set of eyes." Faith laughed. "It will be worth it just to see
Spike helping with research." Willow then looked up. "I'll call him."
The other three people in the room looked at her wide eyed and she
smiled. "I set Spike up with phone service." The all seemed startled
when Buffy then spoke. "All right, then will you call him?" Willow
smiled. "I'll call Tara, Xander, and Anya too." They nodded as a group
and as Willow moved to the phone Giles picked up several books and
stacked them as he moved to a fresh tabletop. "So B, you really trust
Spike to help us?" Buffy grinned. "TRUST is probably a little strong,
but you do, and I trust you."</p>

<p>Faith rolled her tongue inside her mouth. "Great, so my good
word is at stake." Buffy slid closer and gave Faith a hug. "Nah, you
just got me whipped." Faith pressed into the hug. "You saying you've
been a naughty slayer?" Buffy inched up and gave Faith a kiss. "I
thought you were the naughty slayer." Faith pressed harder into the
kiss. "I am, very, VERY naughty, but I picked up a case of
responsibility somewhere along the line. I guess I should have used
protection." Giles looked up and spoke dryly. "Don't worry. It seems
to be a mild case." The two girls stared at him for several beats as
Buffy spoke. "Right, research." Faith spoke right after her.
"Research."  The two girls sat down at the main table and cracked open
books. Buffy then whispered to Faith. "Still, if Whistler could go
good maybe Spike could to." Faith arched a brow. "Right."</p>

<p>Buffy grinned and then Faith did as well and the two fell
silent, the only sound in the room being the turning of pages and the
sounds of Willow on the phone. Once she had finished making the calls
a total silence took over until it was broken by the arrival of Xander
and his girlfriend Anya, who also did not knock. Something Giles felt
the need to comment on. "It seem that all the expense of putting in a
knocker was a waste." Buffy gave her Watcher a confused glance.
"Didn't it come with the house?" The Englishman stammered as he looked
back down at his book. Xander smirked at Giles and then looked at
Buffy. "So what's the what? All new baddie? Or a classic on their
comeback tour?" Buffy shook her head. "Neither, it's… well what is it
exactly?" Giles seemed ready to answer but in her excitement Willow
beat him to it. "Well, you know all those dark evil things trying to
open up the Hellmouth and let all the demons back in?"</p>

<p>Xander nodded. "I seem to remember half a dozen or so."
Willow had already been smiling. "Well this is something to counter
that." He looked confused. "So what? It will close the Hellmouth?"
This time Giles was the one to answer. "Not close it, but ward it, bar
evil from opening it." Xander clapped his hands together. "All righty,
let's find ourselves the deadbolt of the gods." Anya then spoke up.
"You mean The Sentinel?" They all looked up rather abruptly and Anya
seemed startled by the scrutiny as Giles spoke to her. "You've heard
of it?" She shrugged. "Well ya. That's what took out my predecessor if
you know what I mean." Giles seemed confused. "Why would a vengeance
demon challenge the guardian of the Hellmouth?" She then shook her
head. "Didn't challenge as much as was ordered to." I mean to hear it
there were forces getting together every demon they could find to take
down the big bad, or big good… thing."</p>

<p>Giles got up and led her to the couch as the rest of the
Scoobies that were present followed. As he sat her down and sat next
to her he spoke quietly, yet urgently. "Ok Anya, we need you to tell
us EVERYTHING you can remember about The Sentinel." She nodded slowly
as she started to speak. "Well, I mean it's not that much. But
basically there was talk of the gates of Hell finally being sealed. I
mean really sealed not just the normal barrier between dimensions kind
of stuff. Needless to say most of the bigger demons were mad, the
smaller ones, well they pretended to be mad but they were mostly
scared. So all the big ones got all the little ones together and they
all marched to meet this Sentinel who was going to stand over the
Hellmouth and guard it. I never did hear any exact numbers, but I
think that's because they didn't want anyone to know just how many
demons died in the fight. I just know that the world's population of
demons declined. Still they fought, they died, he didn't. So they
managed to chain him up and seal him in this big obsidian block."</p>

<p>Giles was the first to speak. "All right, you identified it as
him. Are you sure it was a male? Also, there was no mention it was
obsidian, are you sure that's what they sealed the Sentinel up in?"
Anya nodded as she spoke. "Yeah he was real clear on the obsidian
part, bragging really. As far as The Sentinel being male, it was
actually referred to as it. I guess I just pictured it as male."
Everyone seemed to be digesting that, except Faith who spoke. "I
dunno, I guess I was thinking a girl." Xander smirked. "That's not
suprising." Faith grinned and blew him a kiss, but then Buffy spoke as
well. "No, no, I thought of it as female too." Xander then shrugged.
"Again, I say not suprising. What's the point?" Giles let out his
breath slowly before he spoke. "It may be nothing, but we know the
first evil transcended physical form and simply took on what ever
shape that suited it. While I doubt this Sentinel would be on THAT
level it may be of similar power."</p>

<p>Willow spoke up then, her face scrunched up in thought. "So
instead of dealing with an ancient evil were dealing with an ancient
good?" Giles took off his glasses and began cleaning them. "I believe
so, and it's an ancient good that needs our help." Buffy held up her
hands. "Wait, wait. How do we know that it's just not something
worse?" Anya was the one to answer as she shook her head vigorously.
"Oh no, no. Demons considered this… guy just short of a demonic
apocalypse. I mean like a manifest divine wrath sort of thing." Faith
supported Anya as she spoke. "I believe it B. I mean Angel told me all
about these "Powers That Be" guys." Faith's words seem to jar the
entire group silent until Buffy spoke. "Angel?" Buffy then took
another breath before speaking. "You said he has a direct connection
to them." Faith grinned at her partner. "I wouldn't say "direct" I
mean it IS Cordelia, but yeah they do seem to have a direct interest
in the big guy."</p>

<p>Buffy then spoke. "Maybe we should call him." At that precise
moment the phone rang, and then gathered Scoobies fell silent. As it
continued to ring they looked at each other with wide eyes until Faith
walked over and picked up the receiver. "Hello? Wesley? Ok, that's
just wicked creepy. What? Well we were literally just about to call
you guys. Oh she did, and it said to call me, but nothing else? Ok…"
As Faith went into the details with her former Watcher they Scoobies
looked at each other, and Xander broke the silence. "Wow, these Powers
That Be don't play around." They all nodded and waited quietly while
Faith finished talking with Wesley. As she came back she sat down.
"Well, the big guy is on his way, and he'll be bringing Wesley, Queen
C, and some guy named Gunn." They all seemed surprised at this and
Faith continued. "With two N's." They then nodded.</p>

<p>Giles then took the lead. "Until they arrive I believe we
should get back to research. So we can have as much ready as possible
for when they do arrive." They all nodded and settled back to their
research, but instead of sitting back down by her girlfriend Faith,
Buffy slid over by her best friend Willow. "Hey Willow, don't worry.
Tara will be here." Willow gave her friend a grin. "Am I that obvious?
I'm just worried I mean after she got kidnapped…" Buffy noticed her
friends pause and laid a comforting hand on Willow's shoulder. "After
she got kidnapped by Riley. I mean it wasn't Riley, but it was."
Willow nodded. "I mean before if she was in danger at least I was
there to protect her… well except for when Oz wolfed out." Buffy then
smiled at her and twisted her head to meet Willow's eyes as they
looked at the floor. "But don't you see Willow? She handled all that
on her own. I mean it's like a Scooby right of passage, and now she's
an official one of us. Would you worry about Xander, or Giles? I mean
you might worry about them being hurt, but you know they can take care
of themselves, right?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded slowly as Buffy smiled. "And so can Tara."
Willow continued to nod. "It's just that I love her…" Buffy smiled and
looked over at the silently reading Faith. Willow followed her eyes.
"Yeah, but she a slayer." Buffy smiled sadly. "Yeah, but that means
that she'll be looking for danger." Willow smiled subtly at her. "Well
so do you." Buffy returned the smile. "Yeah, but I don't love me like
I love her." Willow's smile grew into a grin and Buffy continued.
"You're not understanding the whole irrational love thing." Willow
shook her head, and then nodded as she spoke. "Oh no, I understand."
"Would you like me and Faith to go looking for her?" Willow's response
came right away. "No, no, it's one thing for me to worry irrationally,
but I don't want her to think that I don't think she can take care of
herself." Buffy grinned. "So ten minutes then Faith and I go out
looking?" "If you wouldn't mind?" The two friends grinned at each
other as they started reading again.</p>

<p>The slayers stayed in because Tara arrived not more then five
minutes later, a polite knock that was greeted by Giles. "Finally, one
of us knows how to knock." Tara smiled shyly at that and slipped by
the Watcher. She stopped in front of her partner who had stood up
smiling. The two Wiccan's held hands and leaned in to share a light
kiss in a brief bush of lips. Tara's expression changed to a
questioning one. "You were worried." The fact it was not even a
question caused Willow to blush even deeper then she would have
normally. "Well a little." "I…I'm sorry I took so long. I just wanted
to check our library for anything on this Sentinel." Willow looked
surprised. "We had something on the Sentinel?" Tara shook her head.
"No, but I wanted to check." Willow smiled broadly and Tara's smile
was shy. Giles was the one who broke the moment, but he did it gently.</p>

<p>"Well, that's not suprising. It was only when we were looting
Dracula's castle that we found the books pertaining to the Sentinel."
Tara nodded. "So, a…are these it?" Giles nodded and Tara looked for a
place to sit. Buffy grinned at her and stood up. While Tara's
answering grin seemed a bit unsure it was there as Buffy moved over to
sit by Faith. "Well hello stranger." Buffy first answered Faith by
giving her a kiss. "Well hello yourself." "Doing the best friend
thing?" Buffy smiled. "Yeah. You know you need to get yourself a best
friend. I mean besides me of course." Faith chuckled, then paused. "I
do have a best friend… well I don't know about "best" but we hang when
you and I aren't." Buffy smiled widely. "Really? Anyone I know?" At
that Faith's attempts not to grin failed. "It's Spike." Buffy rolled
her eyes. "Yeah right Faith, you hanging out with Spike." When the
dark slayers expression didn't flinch the light slayer's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Come on, your kidding. Aren't you?" Faith shook her head.
"No, I mean he's in the know. You know so he knows the full pressures
of being a slayer." Buffy's jaw had been slightly open before she
spoke. "Yeah because he's killed two of them." Faith shrugged as her
expression darkened slightly. "Yeah, but with Spike I know what ever I
have done he's done a million times worse. It's strangely comforting."
With out a word she stood up, picked up the books they were looking at
and carried them to the couch. As Faith and everyone else in the room
looked on confusedly she walked back and took Faith's hands. Pulling
Faith to her feet she led her over to the couch. She then sat down and
pulled Faith to sit between her legs on the couch and rest her back to
Buffy's chest. While Buffy was entirely calm doing this Faith was
blushing like crazy, and when her partner handed her the book she
wasted no time burying her nose in it.</p>

<p>Not only did Spike not knock when he entered Giles apartment
but he swung the doors open wide. "My, my, my what a wonderful night
it is!" Xander smirked at the vampire from his chair. "Lemme guess,
made time with the Dracie babes?" He smiled widely back at Xander.
"Made time? I didn't even have to stake them. The poor things got so
hot and bothered they turned to ash on their own." Suddenly another
voice spoke from off side. "Some how I doubt that." Spike turned and
grimaced at his sire, a grimace that turned into a smirk. "Well now,
you wouldn't know would you? I'd suspect that falls into the memories
of Angelus." Angel growled and stepped forward. "You wouldn't know
anything about that!" Spike smirked. "Maybe not, but I know one thing.
You're not human." He punctuated the statement with a short jab to
Angel's face.</p>

<p>He didn't get to follow up because Faith caught the arm before
it retracted and pinned it behind his back. She kept it behind his
back as she swept his legs out from underneath him and slammed him
face first into the floor. Angel seemed ready to start kicking his
childe while he was down when Buffy wrapped her arms around his chest
and pushed him back. "What's a matter sire? A little wound up that you
ruined your slayer for all other men?" "HEY!" At his words Faith
tightened her grip on Spike's arm and the bleach blond vampire growled
in pain. "Sorry luv, just a slip of the tongue." Faith tightened her
grip slightly and it showed on Spike's face. "You want to keep that
tongue you better keep a better hold on it. Now you think you've
learned your lesson?" "Yeah, wait till Angel and I are alone!" She
tightened her grip even further and he had to bite down a yell. "ALL
RIGHT, All right. I'll leave the poof alone. Just let me up!" She
seemed to consider for a moment, and then climbed off of him.</p>

<p>Spike got up rubbing his shoulder and glaring at his sire,
something that caused a rare grin to appear on Angel's face. "I bet
that hurt. Of course I bet not being able to fight back probably hurt
even worse. I mean I might not kill like I used to, but at least I
have a soul as an excuse." Spike growled and seemed ready to lunge
again when Faith stormed in close to Angel. "Look big guy! I can't
even begin to tell you how much you have done for me, and I love you
for it, but if you can't play nice I WILL drop you on your ass too!"
Angel seemed shocked at Faith's outburst while Spike grinned
triumphantly. As they all simmered down Giles stepped forward. "Now
that we have that out of our system, perhaps we should get down to the
matter at hand?" His fellow rogue watcher Wesley stepped forward.
"Quite right. Now, from what Faith told me over the phone we are
trying to free an ancient force of light that has been imprisoned by
the forces of darkness?"</p>

<p>Spike scoffed. "Well then, what the hell am I here for?" Buffy
answered that question. "I suggested it. I figured that if you knew
about the Judge you might know something about the Sentinel." He shook
his head. "The big blue bastard was Dru's idea. You'd have better luck
asking Nancy Boy over there." Angel growled as his childe again. Spike
refused to flinch and lit a cigarette. Giles seemed ready to say
something, but Spike noticed and the look he gave Giles showed it was
pointless. So the Englishman simply sighed as Angel started to speak.
"It's old. Older then me, even older then Darla. I think I heard the
Master speak of it once, but that was only because he was grateful
that it wouldn't be there to stop him from opening the Hellmouth."
Buffy sighed and ran her fingers through her hair. With out even
thinking about it Faith lightly touched Buffy's arm and the two girls
smiled at each other. </p>

<p>When they looked up they saw Angel had looked away while Spike
was grinning viciously. Guilt seemed to stab through the two
simultaneously, but Angel spoke before they could. "Don't ever feel
guilty for being happy." They both nodded sadly, and perhaps true to
form Cordelia broke the tension. "Ok Angel's gone from angry to
angsting. Now that things are back to normal we might want to get on
to freeing this gatekeeper guy." They all nodded and started to find
chairs in the rapidly filling apartment. Faith slid closer to the
well-built African American that had arrived with the rest of Angel
Investigations. "So you Gunn?" He nodded once. "Yeah." She smiled at
him. "Nice to see they finally have someone with a sense of style on
the payroll." He was smiling back as Cordelia let out an outraged
shriek. "Hey, what about me? I have more style then those three guys
put together!"  She smirked at the former cheerleader. "No Cordy, you
have fashion. Fashion is wearing what's in. Style is wearing whatever
you want, but making it look good."</p>

<p>She let out an injured huff as Xander spoke. "Um excuse me,
but maybe we could continue the House of Style AFTER we unchain
Prometheus?" Giles appeared shocked. "Xander, that's a classical
literature reference." He seemed to shrink down a bit. "Actually I saw
it on Xena." Giles let out a sigh. "Here is what we have so far. The
forces of light decided to send down a guardian to stand guard at the
mouth of Hell until the end of the world. The forces of darkness
learned of this and tried to stop him, but they learned that they
could not destroy him. So instead they imprisoned the Sentinel in a
giant block of obsidian." "Obsidian?" Everyone looked at Angel when he
made his surprised exclamation, and Giles was the one to speak. "Yes
Angel, obsidian. Do you know something about it?" "I've seen it." All
eyes focused on him as he spoke. </p>

<p>"In the crypts underneath Wolfram and Heart." Faith was the
one to ask the Question the Scoobies all wanted to ask. "You mean the
guys who blew up your old offices?" All of Angel Investigations nodded
the affirmative. Xander asked another question. "So, what's the deal
with Wolfram and Heart?" Cordelia looked at her old boyfriend. "Well
Xander, you know all the jokes about evil lawyers? They aren't jokes
when it comes to Wolfram and Heart." Buffy moved closer to her
ex-boyfriend. "Do you think it's still there?" He nodded. "It should
be. I mean it was huge. Not the kind of thing you move very often, and
by the spells they had lain on it I don't think they would want to
move it at all." In a rare bit of assertiveness Tara then spoke up.
"Do you remember what kind of spells they were?" Angel shook his head.
"Not exactly, but they seemed protective, and they looked like they
were trying to keep something in, instead of something out."</p>

<p>Willow put her hand on her partner's knee and it caused Tara
to look at her. "You think it's trying to escape?" Tara nodded, though
it was more a gentle dipping of her head. "It might explain the powers
that be sending Cordelia's vision, and they might have even led
Dracula to Buffy." Both slayers seemed offended at the idea, but chose
to remain silent, Willow however did not. "So if we broke the spells..."
Tara finished her sentence. "It could break free on it's own." Both of
the Wiccan's smiled at each other until Gunn decided to add some
reality to the situation. "Well, this seems real important to all of
ya, and since Angel's footin the bill I'll help, but hasn't anyone
else noticed all the "ifs"?" The rest of them nodded slowly as Wesley
then spoke. "We need more information." Spike then stood up. "Well,
well, best of luck with the great escape, or big heist or whatever
else you end up doing."</p>

<p>Faith stood up right after him. "You? Nah uh Spike. We." Spike
held up his hands and shook his head. "Oh no. I was happy to help you
track down my own rogue brat, and Drac... well like I said he owed me
money, but there's no way I'm going to help you lock up the
Hellmouth." Before Faith could reply Buffy stood up and walked to
close to Spike. "But you helped me keep it shut before." He shook his
head. "I helped you waste my sire, and I'll help you again if that's
what you had in mind." Angel seemed ready to reply but Faith motioned
him to stay silent as Buffy continued. "We both know it was more then
that. You said you liked this world." "That was before it shoved a
damn microchip in my head to keep me from killing humans." Angel did
speak then, grinning evilly as he did so. "Well then you'll be coming
with us either way. Sitting up front, or riding in the trunk." </p>

<p>Spike growled as he spoke. "Fine, but we better stop along the
way, I need some fresh fags." Gunn seemed shocked and Faith bit her
lip to keep from laughing. "He's British." "Ohhhhhhh, and in England a
fag is a cig, I get ya." Spike lit up a fresh one as he glared at
Gunn. "Sorry junior, your not my type." Angel again went to stick a
barb in his childe's side. "No one's your type anymore now are they?"
Spike blew a cloud of smoke in his sire's direction. "Yeah, but not by
choice. Not just because I'm some sort of sissy." Before it could
escalate Buffy stepped in.  "Well I think if we want more information
on a LA law firm we need to go to LA. So who's up for a road trip?"
The Scoobies that had once known Wesley Wyndam Pryce seemed shocked at
the clear confident tone. "Buffy's right, from what we already know
about Wolfram and Heart anything they want imprisoned or destroyed is
probably a potent force for good, and we can't learn anything here in
Sunnydale." </p>

<p>They all agreed with that and started shuffling out of Giles
apartment. Angel was the one who spoke as the rest of his team climbed
into his convertible. He handed Buffy a card. "It has our new address
on there. We'll go and get things started." Buffy nodded, and then as
Angel turned to leave she spoke. "Angel, wait!" He seemed confused,
but he turned back around. She arched up and kissed his cheek,
whispering in his ear as she did so. "I really am happy." He smiled at
that. "I'm glad." The former lovers shared a look and then Angel went
down to the drivers seat and started the engine. As the car pulled
away Buffy felt a familiar set of arms wrap around her from behind. As
a soft set of lips kissed the top of her head Buffy sighed. "I know B,
I'm hurting for him too." The two slayers sighed in unison as Xander
cleared his throat. As the Scoobies looked him he spoke to Giles.
"See, you just have to do it right." Giles gave the young man a harsh
look as he started to speak. </p>

<p>"Well, while Giles has his flashy new wheels we still have
twice as many people as we should." They all seemed to consider that
until Faith spoke to Buffy. "Your mom?" "My mom?" Faith shrugged.
"Well, after your coming out you told her ALL about being a slayer. So
while she may not be in the thick of things I have to think that makes
her like the slayer reserve." Buffy shook her head. "No, her car, ok,
but they don't make liability insurance for moms. Giles, you, Xander,
Willow, and Anya get your stuff. Faith, Spike and I will get the car
from mom. Meet at the mansion in two hours." They all nodded as Giles
went inside to quickly pack books with Tara and Willow helping him
while Xander and Anya walked off to go to his parent's basement.</p>

<p>"Ok, I'll pack a few things and we will be on our way." Buffy
shook her head emphatically. "No, we need a car, not a driver." "I
don't know, I've seen you drive." Joyce Summers shared a smile with
her daughter's girlfriend who was already smiling. "But there'll be
danger, big, hairy, fanged, clawed danger." Joyce nodded. "All the
more reason for you to have a good driver to get you away from all
that danger. We'll even stay at your fathers. I will keep him off of
your back." Buffy shook her head, but gently. "No, we'll be staying at
Angel's he said his new place is big enough." Joyce started walking to
her bedroom. "That's great. I'd love to see it." Buffy let out a
muffled shriek and then glared at her girlfriend. "And would YOU stop
encouraging her?" Faith held up her hands and tried to look shocked.</p>

<p>Buffy managed to catch up with her mother as she was getting
out a suitcase. "What about Dawn?" With those words her mother stopped
short. "I didn't think of that. You might have to fight demons, but we
can't expose your sister to that." Dawn had heard them as they passed
where she was staring wide-eyed at Spike as the vampire was pointedly
ignoring her. "It's ok. I can spend a few days by myself." Her mother
and sister looked up with similar expressions, and actually spoke in
unison. "Oh no you can't." Faith laughed at that, and Dawn's sorrowful
face. "Sorry kid, but Xander's coming with us anyways." Dawn gave
Faith a pleading look that was missed by both of the elder Summers
women. Joyce seemed to miss it because she was coming to a decision,
and it caused her to sigh. "I can't come with, but I also can't be
with out the car." They both seemed caught up in that as Faith spoke
up. "There's always Spike's car."  He seemed to hear that from where
he was sitting in the living room. "Fine! But I'm driving!" </p>

<p>Buffy's shoulders slumped. "Spike's car it is. By the way... why
does Dawn let you call her kid? She HATES it when anyone else does."
Dawn answered as Faith exaggerated her grin. "That's because there was
obviously a slayer mix-up and Faith was supposed to be my sister while
you were just supposed to be her girlfriend." Buffy just shook her
head at her younger sister, and over her younger sister's puffed up
shoulders at her still smirking girlfriend. As they all walked to the
living room Buffy whispered to Faith. "Reformed or not, you are still
a trouble maker." "Not to worry B. I have you to keep me on the
straight and narrow... well on the narrow anyway." Buffy shook her head,
but playfully as she sped up her pace. Both slayers were still
smiling, and when they got to the living room they found Spike smiling
as well. "So ladies will I be your chauffeur?" </p>

<p>They both nodded and he got up and offered an arm to each
lady. Faith was the one to comment. "Your mood seems to have
improved." He smiled broadly at her as she took his arm. "I've just
been thinking of potential "accidents" that might happen to Angel. I
mean it IS a dangerous situation we will be getting into." Buffy
strode up and grabbed his other arm rather forcefully and his smile
grew. "Don't worry pet. I said I was just thinking of them." The
smaller slayer began pulling him out of the door as Faith spoke over
her shoulder. "Love ya ... mom, Dawn." Joyce smiled at that, and then
Buffy spoke. "Love you guys." First Joyce responded. "Love you too."
When Dawn didn't reply she nudged her youngest. "Yeah, try not to get
Faith hurt." As they got out of the door Spike spoke. "Ah, reminds me
of my family, and why I'm glad they are all long dead. Right. Meet you
two at the mansion?" The slayer's nodded as the vampire took off
towards his lair in the ruins of the Initiative.</p>

<p>"Why don't you just sit in her lap! I mean she's your
girlfriend any way, and it would give me so much more room." Willow
didn't quite glare at Anya, but she did glare at Xander who was
grinning at the three girls from his position in the front passenger's
seat of Giles convertible. Tara looked over at Willow. "W...well. I sup...
suppose it would be ok." Willow smiled at Tara, but before she could
answer Anya spoke up again. "That's it! Stop this car!" Giles didn't
even bother speaking as he eased the car over to the shoulder of the
road. As soon as it came to a complete stop she almost leapt from her
seat and stormed over to the front passenger side door. Yanking it
open she glared at her boyfriend. "Get out!" He looked up at her."
What?" She put her hands on her hips. "You heard me, get out. You
stole that shot gunning seat before the rest of us had a chance, and
now I am taking it back." </p>

<p>He seemed ready to speak, but her glare kept him silent as he
slunk to the back of the car. She had a smug little smile on her face
as she slid in beside Giles and put on her seat belt. "That's much
better." While that was happening Xander was attempting to get
comfortable in the back seat. As the jostling continued Tara looked
over at Willow. "You still could." Willow looked confused. "Could
what?" "Sit in my l...l...lap." Willow was smiling until she saw Xander
was as well and settled for giving the young man a shove. Giles sighed
as he pulled the car back onto the road. "Now settle down back there!"
Xander, Willow and even Tara suddenly grinned at him, Xander being the
first to speak. "Or what? You'll turn this car around?" The teasing
continued in a similar vein as they continued down the road to Los
Angeles. </p>

<p>Now ahead of them, Buffy had turned in her seat to see why
Giles car had stopped. "You think something's wrong?" Faith smiled and
shook her head. "Nah, look Anya is just yelling at Xander, business as
usual. We have more important things to worry about." As she finished
her sentence she leaned forward from the back seat to the front, and
the radio while Spike slapped her hands away. "My car, my radio."
Faith sat back in a sulk. "Can't we listen to something that's not
older then I am?" When Buffy turned back around from Spike saw the
concerned look in her eyes. "Don't worry slayer. They have the
address. Xander's just going to get pussy whipped a bit and then
they'll be right behind us." Faith arched her brow. "Oh, and you are
one to talk about being whipped?" Spike scowled into the rearview
mirror he was using to keep an eye on his passengers more then the
road. </p>

<p>Faith smirked back into the mirror. "Dru just has to do that
loony sing song voice and you'll be all over her." Spike grinned at
the dark haired slayer. "Don't be so shocked. I'd bet shed make you
melt with her baby doll voice too... that is if you didn't already have
your own baby doll." His words were said as Buffy turned around again
from looking out the back window. "Yeah, whatever girlfriend." He
jerked his head. "What?" She smirked at him. "Come on now Spike. You
and Faith hanging out, talking about stuff, you're her Willow." The
bleached blond was confused at that until Buffy grinned at him. "It's
a good thing... if you like being a girl's best girlfriend." Faith
rolled her eyes at her own girlfriend. "Take out the girl part and you
got it." Spike smiled at that and squared his shoulders. "Why thank
you Ducks." Faith smiled and nodded at him.</p>

<p>Buffy decided to continue. "Yeah, who would have thought a
vampire could become best friends with a vampire slayer?" Spike
smirked at her. "Probably the ones who thought a slayer would shag a
vampire." Buffy frowned at him as he continued. "Still, it's not like
I bother with most of that crap. I mean I wasted the annoying one, I
stopped the mouth of Hell from being opened... when I became a vampire I
got rid of rules. I didn't just trade one set for another." Buffy
arched her brows at him. "So you'll do whatever you damn well please
and to Hell with the consequences?" Spike smiled rather evilly. "Now
you're getting it pet." "I'm not your pet, but I do have a better
understanding of why you and Faith get along." As she spoke Spike got
out a cigarette and lit up as he replied. "And why is that?" She
smirked at him. "Because she's is a good girl with a bad side, and you
are a bad boy with a good side." </p>

<p>Spike blew out a puff of smoke. "That's a horrible thing to
say about a guy!" Faith seemed to be looking at the vampire closely.
"No Spike, she right, and that's your strength." He looked intrigued.
"How so?" "You feel, and I mean more then hate, rage, or lust like
most vamps. You feel things like love, tenderness. Things like that
are normally thought to be part of a soul, but somehow your demon
remembered them." Spike exhaled again, but this time he drew it out.
"Can't argue that." The car seemed to lapse into silence with Spike
watching the road, and Buffy resting her head to Faith's shoulder, and
Faith resting her cheek against the top of Buffy's head. It stayed
that way until they entered the Los Angeles City limits.</p>

<p>Most of the Scoobies were staring slack-jawed in the lobby of
the new offices of Angel Investigations, but Xander was already
talking as he walked up to Wesley. "I say Boy! Carry my bags up to my
room and there will be a nice tip in it for you." That seemed to break
the silence that had fallen over the Scoobies as Wesley replied. "I'll
give you the tip Xander. Carry your own bags." His fellow rogue
watcher stepped forward and in front of Xander. "He does make a good
point though. Perhaps we should settle into our rooms and then meet in
some central area to make plans?" Wesley nodded and turned to get
keys. As Angel exited his office Spike spoke far louder then was
necessary. "Nice place Angel, it suits you, big and useless." An elbow
powered by the slayer strength of Buffy Summers cut off anything else
William the Bloody would have said and turned it into a muffled grunt
of pain.</p>

<p>While everyone stepped forward to get keys Gunn stepped near
Faith and the dark haired slayer gave her partner a nod. While Buffy
went to get there key Gunn started speaking. "So you two getting the
honeymoon suite?" Faith smirked at that and arched a brow. "Probably,
any problem with that?" Gunn grinned. "Nah, I think it's a beautiful
thing." Faith laughed out loud. "We get that a lot, but I have a
feeling that you're not here to talk to me about my girlfriend... of
course I could be wrong." Gunn shook his head. "Nah, it's this Spike
guy. When Angel talks about him he is a bad ass or a pain in the ass.
I mean I'm already working with one vampire, but at least Angel has
that whole curse deal. What's keeping blondie in line?" "You mean
besides regular beatings from me and Buffy?" Faith took a considering
breath before she continued.</p>

<p>"There is a microchip imbedded in his brain that keeps him
from being able to hurt any human being." Gunn was shocked at that.
"For real? Why aren't there more vamps like that running around?"
Faith shook her head. "It was this big top secret government project,
and the whole point of the chip was keeping the vamps from attacking
them. The fact it keeps him from his typical maiming and killing ways
is just a bonus." "So what, Uncle Sam was recruiting bloodsuckers?"
Faith nodded. "Them and any other demon they could get their hands on.
They had this big idea that they could control the demons, but demons
got out, place got trashed, and now Spike's chip is just a relic of
our tax dollars at work." The conversation broke up as everyone
started picking up their bags and heading towards their rooms. As
Buffy and Faith climbed the stairs the petite blonde smiled at her
partner. "Make a new friend?" Faith grinned back at her. </p>

<p>When they had gotten to the room Faith chuckled and looked at
a blushing Buffy. "It was Cordelia's idea." Faith looked around the
honeymoon suite and laughed more openly. "I'll have to thank her."
Faith's voice then started to deepen. "Of course this IS our first
night in the honeymoon suite." Buffy's smile grew playful as Faith
stepped away from where they had set their luggage and advanced on
Buffy. The smaller slayer was backing away, but smiling all the while.
The two slayers stood eyeing each other, Faith seeming to look for an
opening to grab Buffy and Buffy looking for an opening to get away.
"Come on B, you going to let a honeymoon suite go to waste?" Buffy put
on a fake pout. "You didn't even carry me across the threshold." Faith
smirked. "Let's fix that." With those words she lunged and got her
hands on Buffy's hips. With no seeming effort she lifted her straight
up and held her. From that position Buffy wrapped her legs around
Faith, at first they were under Faith's arms, but she slid down the
dark slayers body until they caught at Faith's hips.</p>

<p>There she tightened her legs hold and leaned into press her
lips to Faith's. Buffy's arms wrapped around Faiths head to cradle it
while her fingers played with the wild curls of soft brown hair
flowing from Faith's head. Faith's arms wrapped around Buffy's waist
while her hands slid to support the smaller slayer's shapely behind.
They barely broke for air as their kisses continued, tongues meeting
in yet another passionate form of contest between the pair. A contest
that neither could gain an advantage in, it could have went far longer
if their slayer senses had not indicated the presence of a vampire.
Faith still held Buffy aloft as they broke the kiss and turned to look
at Spike. He looked back blankly and continued to do so as Buffy and
Faith let go of each other and Buffy slipped to stand on the ground
again. They continued to stare at him for a long beat until he seemed
to shake himself. "Sorry to interrupt but they're planning the big
powwow in the lobby."</p>

<p>The two girls nodded and sighed as they walked out past a
smirking Spike. Buffy walked ahead of them as Faith dropped back to
walk next to Spike. "Enjoy the show?" His grin grew. "How could I not?
Even with out the shapely bodies you two still have enough chemistry
between you to burn up any vamp." Faith nodded. "Yeah, it's suprising
it took as long as it did for me and B to hook up." Spike shook his
head. "You two didn't just "hook up" she hasn't had that look since
Angel, but it's missing that doomed expression." Faith made a sound
that seemed to both laugh and scoff. "That's probably why we didn't
fall in love before. I was so fucked up I would have hurt her more
then Angelus." Spike shrugged. "Big deal. The little thing obviously
adores you as much as you do her, and that's that." "Better not let
her hear you calling her the little thing, but yeah. I guess you're
right." </p>

<p>While they shared a smile his was larger. "I usually am."
"This coming from the guy that turned Harmony?" His expression quickly
soured. "I said usually." Faith laughed at him as they entered the
lobby. Cordelia looked up at the pair as they walked up to the main
seating area. "I'm glad you're happy." Faith slid in to share a larger
padded chair with Buffy. "Why, what's up?" Cordelia blew her bangs out
of her face. "It's a matter of what's down, but I'll let Xander
explain since it's his dumb idea." Alexander Harris frowned at his
ex-girlfriend as he started to explain. "Well we were going over
Wolfram and Heart security, and practices." When Faith seemed confused
he explained. "Practices is like their hours, if they get a lot of
deliveries and stuff like that." Faith nodded. "So security is tight?"
All of Angel Investigations nodded as Angel spoke. "That, and they are
geared to deal with the supernatural. So they have things like vampire
detectors." </p>

<p>Xander nodded. "So what we are doing is trying to find holes
in the system." Cordelia then piped in. "Actually we're making them.
Go ahead! Tell them!" Xander didn't seem phased and actually seemed
exasperated by the former cheerleader. "They are going to have every
point of access guarded so we are going to make one, and since we are
talking about subterranean chambers there's going to be some digging."
Anya was smiling proudly. "With all of Xander's construction work and
living underground he is perfectly suited for the job." He smiled as
his face got red from his girlfriend's praise. While Faith was
grinning along with most of the group she poised a question. "So?
Wouldn't they detect that too?" Angel was the one to answer. "Not in
LA." Buffy was snuggled so close that when she spoke Faith actually
felt it where her chest was against Buffy's back. "Of course." Faith
arched her neck around Buffy. "Well you ARE the brains, care to
explain to the looks?" Buffy scrunched up her face as she smiled. "LA
geology is kind of like Jell-O with all the quakes and stuff. So it
would be a waste of time and money for them."</p>

<p>Xander nodded again. "So except for some thick walls there's
not much they could do, and we've got the gal pals and the father and
son team to take care of that." Buffy, Faith, Angel, and Spike all
frowned at him as Willow spoke. "But that still leaves the cameras and
stuff. I have been trying to hack their system, but the stuff
connected to the net is no good." Buffy considered that. "So all the
important stuff is all inside." Willow nodded, and as she did Tara's
discomfort seemed to visibly increase. Silently she laid her hand on
Tara's leg and rubbed just above the knee. When Tara looked up she saw
Willow smiling at her and she relaxed, but the concern on her face
never faded. While all this was happening Gunn seemed rather stilled,
he was looking at Willow and Tara, then he looked at Buffy and Faith.
Faith winked at him. "Something in the water." He then looked at
Cordelia and she squealed. "Noooooo!" At which he simply shrugged. </p>

<p>Angel shook his head. "Ok, Willow needs to get into Wolfram
and Heart. Now they are going to know my face and the rest of Angel
Investigations." Faith suddenly looked downcast. "They'll know me
too." She then found her hands being taken by Buffy, and held by Buffy
in front of her in her lap. "They'd know both of us. We ARE the
slayers after all." Faith just nodded. Spike then grinned. "We'll
they'd be hard pressed NOT to know me. You have to figure that applies
to the world's luckiest Watcher as well." Giles straightened his
glasses at that. "I beg your pardon?" Spike smirked. "Oh come on. I
can just imagine what it would be like to watch Faith and Buffy... in
fact I think I will." Spike then closed his eyes and got a wicked grin
on his face.</p>

<p>Willow continued to fidget and muss with her suit jacket. Next
to her in the elevator Xander Harris was standing ramrod straight and
looking directly ahead. With out turning he spoke to her. "Something
wrong mam?" The meaning of his words was clear and she stood still.
Because while they had been costumed by the aspiring actress Cordelia
they were now in the offices of Wolfram and Heart and had to stay in
character. In her case that was a technician for a non-existent
computer company that had a business plan on record, but no offices.
Xander had the more difficult role because he was posing as an actual
Wolfram and Heart security guard which meant if they were questioned
the questions would be directed at him. All the same she reviewed
their story. That she had been called in to repair the computer
system.</p>

<p>Of course there was always something wrong with the computer
system so the figured that no one would question a consultant being
called. Of course they had no real paper work to back up their story
so if worse came to worse they would end up relying on the 9mm pistol
Xander had strapped to his hip. As he pushed a floor number at random
she was praying to every deity she could think of to keep them
concealed. Of course they would try to find a nice out of the way
terminal since any office this size would be connected in a network.
Once there she had three objectives, first to get all the information
they could on the bock of obsidian in the basement. Second she would
try to get all the information possible on their security measures,
and finally she would try to put her own password into the system so
that she could an easier time hacking them again if she had to.</p>

<p>The reason Xander was there was just to make sure she was able
to do it and live to tell the tale. Angel, Wesley and Cordelia had all
seemed skeptical about their decision until they saw Xander break into
his luggage and break out an assortment of military hardware any SWAT
officer would be proud to call their own. The doors finally opened and
they stepped out to see the floor's receptionist, and it was with a
shock Willow realized they were on a high traffic floor. What startled
her even further was the way Xander nonchalantly walked right up to
her. "I'm escorting the computer consultant and we need an empty
office." The receptionist first looked at Xander, and then at Willow
and the hacked tried to give her a smile. "Where is her visitor id?"
Xander's face had been rather cool, but he allowed his expression to
look a little embarrassed. "Being printed, security took 45 minutes
just to confirm my id since I am a new hire." The receptionist nodded
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Ever since that Angel guy managed to break in things have
went from paranoid to insane." Xander's eyes seemed to get harsh and
he threw a meaningful look at her and then at Willow and the
receptionist clamed up. "Right, Lindsey is on some big project so you
can use his office." Xander flashed her a smile. "Thanks, we'll be out
of there in no time." Willow wanted to run into the doorway that the
receptionist pointed out, but she let her pace be dictated by Xander.
All the while she was inwardly amazed at his composure because they
both knew if they were caught being arrested was the least of their
concerns, but he had what she called his "soldier face" on. She had
first seen it when they had become their costumes on Halloween, and it
had shown up every other time Xander was required to use the military
skills imparted to him by Ethan Rane's spell. While most of the time
it kinda creeped her out it was comforting in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>With out either of them speaking a word Xander motioned her to
Lindsey's desk and she slid into his chair. Of course they both had
been told who he was before they had ever set foot into Wolfram and
Heart, and Willow was already taking advantage. She hooked her own
laptop into Lindsey's terminal so she would have something to work on
while she cracked his password. While she worked she was already
starting to sweat, W&H had top-notch computer security, and while she
might have greater system access with Lindsey's computer she had to
get into it first. Which she was able to do, but it left her worried
enough that she first focused on the security and shut down the
security cameras. Wolfram and Heart may be irredeemably evil, but she
knew they were also lawyers and would have the law after them in no
time if they had enough evidence. When she saw the camera lights
flicker and go out she smiled and her typing increased. </p>

<p>Multi-tasking she knew the computer recognized a system
failure and used it to gather information on the security system.
Telling the machine to check over its system she backed up a copy of
its actions to her computer, making Wolfram and Heart's security
detail it's own defenses to her. While their computer and her computer
talked she started looking for information on the Sentinel. Since she
figured it would have been here for awhile she checked the oldest
files using parameters provided by Angel, Anya, and their research.
She was so focused on her task she barely registered Xander picking
something up on the radio he was carrying. They had spent some of
Angel's money to get a radio scanner that they had used for several
hours until they had the radio frequencies that security used.
Frequencies that had been programmed into a police walkie-talkie that
a sullen faced Angel had managed to acquire. That radio was now
reporting some difficulties with the security cameras.</p>

<p>His eyes first darted to the now dead cameras and then to
Willow. She silently apologized to the accusation in his eyes and
redoubled her efforts. Finally locating files, not in the past, but in
the present about the time of Angel's break in with a concern by
security about how close he had gotten to the Sentinel. That reference
led her to other files that she started downloading as fast as she
could as the door to Lindsey's office opened and two security guards
entered. Willow tried not to look scared as they turned to Xander and
started questioning him. "I've never seen you here before." Xander
nodded. "Yeah, I was hired after the break in." The guy's eyes
narrowed. "They make sure they introduce all new hires to the rest of
security. So why don't I know you?" They both saw that both guards'
hands had dropped to the guns at their waists. Xander shook his head.
"I don't know. Have you taken time off or something?" He shook his
head. "I got out of the hospital not three days after that fucker put
me in there and I haven't missed a day since.</p>

<p>Xander nodded. "That explains it. I was literally hired the
next day. With you guys already in the hospital they didn't want
themselves left vulnerable." The senior guard looked suspicious while
the junior one turned to look at Willow. "Hey, you stop whatever you
are doing." Xander immediately stepped in. "She's trying to get the
cameras back online." The senior guard spoke up again. "They hadn't
gone down until you two got here." Willow was the one to speak up this
time. "Yeah, but they still weren't working. They were showing footage
from several days ago, but with the office not being used nobody had
noticed until today." Both still seemed suspicious, but also looked a
little more relaxed. The senior officer spoke. "Be that as it may mam
you are tampering with our security, and I can't allow that until I
know for sure that you are supposed to be here." The hand that he had
resting on the butt of his pistol allowed no room for argument as he
took the other hand and reached for his radio. </p>

<p>The look on Xander's face begged Willow for a distraction and
she gave an almost invisible nod. "Ok, just let me save my work." She
then reached up and hit several keys. Suddenly the lights went out and
all Willow heard was the sounds of a scuffle and something that
sounded like an aerosol can, that was followed by some pained shouts.
When the emergency lights came on Xander was standing over the
unconscious forms of both the security guards with the can of mace
from his belt now in his hand. He turned to Willow. "All right Wills,
time to go." She nodded. "Just five more seconds." Then she
immediately began entering her own alphanumeric password into the
system. Xander had first stooped down and relieved the guards of their
pistols. "I don't think we have five seconds." He then peeked out the
door and quickly ducked back in. He tucked one guard's pistol into the
front of his pants while he took the other one in hand. "You have
three left tops."</p>

<p>She unplugged her cord from Lindsey's computer. "Don't need
them. I'm done. Now let's get out of here." He nodded and she slid up
to stand behind him. "Easier said then done. They have their weapons
drawn. So when we get out of here stay down and keep right behind me.
We're heading for the stairs because the elevators are not an option."
She nodded. "And out of order. I locked them down, and I shut off all
the lights in the building." He smiled. "Good work. Now let's go."
With out another word he flung the door wide and fired a shot into the
emergency light box. That threw them into deep shadow while it put the
approaching security into sharp focus. Almost looking like cardboard
cut outs at the National Guard firing range Xander treated them as
such as he raised the pistol and fired once at the dark blob above the
forms shoulders. Though the cardboard cut outs didn't scream and fall
to the ground as the guard did. Xander ignored that fact as he saw the
other two duck for cover and he grabbed Willow's hand to pull her
towards the stairwell. </p>

<p>The guards had not managed to return fire until they had
gotten to the stairs and even then they just hit the stairwell
doorway. Willow had pulled a freestanding ashtray from where they
passed a smoking area and used it to wedge the door closed. She had a
horrified look on her face when she turned to him. "You, you killed
him!" Her grabbed her by the shoulders. "Willow! Did you see those
stake things on their belts? They know what Wolfram and Heart do, and
they don't care. Vampires don't have a soul, but these guys do and
they are selling out the rest of humanity. So yeah I'll kill them.
I'll do what I have to in order to get this done and get back to
Anya." His voice then softened. "Willow, he had his gun out too, and
he could have kept you from ever getting back to Tara. I didn't like
killing him, but I know I'll like dying even less. Now we need to
run." She nodded and they started flying down the stairs. "I'm sorry
Xander." He shook his head. "No need to be. I'm probably going to
throw up once this is all over, but not before we're safe."</p>

<p>As they ran Xander unclipped his radio and changed the
frequency. "Bring the car around." That was the signal to Charles Gunn
to move his pick up into position to pick them up. Neither of them had
ever worked with Charles Gunn before, but their friends seemed to
trust him, and they just had to hope that was enough. When Xander
switched the radio back they heard security say that they had managed
to open the door they had wedged shut, and security beneath them had
started up the stairs. With out a second thought Xander kicked open
the door at the next stairwell they reached and marched out with
Willow one step behind. At first all they saw were the law office
workers cowering in fear of the unknown gunman, but those people were
then ignored as they ran for another doorway to another set of stairs.
Xander kicked that door down too, but as he did several pullets tore
through and struck him squarely in the chest and knocked him on his
back. While on some level Willow knew that he was wearing a
bulletproof vest the sight still made her scream in fear. </p>

<p>Xander however was already reacting as he pulled the other
guard's pistol from his belt and emptied both into the doorway. He
cast both pistols aside and grimaced as he stood up, drawing his own
pistol at the same time. His eyes frantically darted around until
Willow suddenly pointed to the fire exit. He nodded once as they both
ran towards it. Willow spoke as they ran. "Doesn't that hurt?" Xander
replied as they reached the door. "It will when the adrenaline wears
off." He raised his pistol and fired three shots into the fire door at
the halfway point. With no response he pushed that door open and added
the sound of the fire alarm to the chaos. Of course it didn't seem
that much in the steady ringing that had started after the exchange of
gunfire between Xander and the team behind the door. As the hit the
fire exit they ran at dangerous speeds down the stairs until Xander
pulled her to a stop where they saw the fire door beneath them
opening. </p>

<p>As a foot clad in regulation footwear stepped through Xander
pulled a egg shaped object from his pocket and pulled a pin, which let
the spool drop away. She was shock when he actually held it another
two seconds, but he then dropped it over the edge. Knowing what was
going to happen Willow clasped her hands over her hears, bit they
still started ringing when the explosion went off in the confined
space of the fire escape. With out looking behind him Xander grabbed
her hand with his free one and pulled her along behind him. Willow
closed her eyes as they passed the blast site and she allowed Xander
to guide her past. It actually was after they had passed Willow
slipped and fell hard on one knee. She saw the footprint she left when
she had slipped and realized it was because she had blood on her shoe.
She was about to throw up when Xander looked back at her. His "soldier
face" slipped for a second and he looked concerned. "Are you ok
Willow?" She took a breath and brought up Tara's face inside her mind.
The image of her lover seemed to bring a calm over her and she nodded
as she got up. Xander's face had slipped back into its solider
expression but it actually seemed calmer as he gave her a hand up.</p>

<p>"Can I have the mace?" He nodded again, and she thought that
if they weren't in combat he would have smiled. As he handed her the
can of mace they sped up, knowing they were almost to the ground
floor. However when they got out the door they found Gunn, and half a
dozen security guards. Of course four of the six were laid out in
front of, or underneath the grill of Gunn's pickup. The fifth was laid
out by the driver's side door. The problem was the sixth had his gun
out and pointed that the black man's shaven scalp. Xander slid one way
while Willow slid the other. Harris had his gun out and pointed at the
guard while they both stared each other down. "Put down your weapon or
I'll shoot him!" While the guard seemed almost panicked Xander was far
more calm. "You do and you die once second after." "Put down your
weapon and surrender!" Xander shook his head. "Not happening. You know
as well as I that we'll never see a jail cell." The guard looked even
more panicked as Xander continued to look calm, nothing in his
expression betraying that he could see his friend sliding closer to
the guards position. </p>

<p>He also knew that Willow was getting close and he had to make
sure that the guard was distracted. "Drop the weapon and you'll live
to collect your pension!" When Xander started yelling the guard
tightened his grip, but as he started to draw in the breath to speak
Willow sprang up and sprayed the can of mace into the guard's face.
Gunn might not have realized what had been happening, but there was no
way to know it was he ducked underneath the guard's pistol and forced
it up with both hands. As he drove his knee into the guard's crotch he
took one hand from the guard's gun and hit him underneath the chin.
The combined hits knocked the guard unconscious and he fell back,
connecting with Gunn's pickup before he hit the ground. Before he had
hit the ground Gunn was running to the drivers side while Willow
climbed in the passenger seat. As they did that Xander leapt into the
bed of the pickup. </p>

<p>They had started peeling out, but when Willow let Gunn know
that the cameras weren't on and their pictures hadn't been taken he
slowed down so they wouldn't attract any attention. As they started
back towards the Hyperion Gunn turned to Willow. "Did I hear a bomb go
off?" Willow smiled nervously. "Ummm, Xander used a grenade." Gunn
shook his head. "Great, I'm working with Timothy McVeigh." Willow
looked back over her shoulder and laughed. While in another part of LA
the slayers were having problems of their own.</p>

<p>After his centuries of experience Angel knew there were few
things that could shock him, and yet he couldn't keep himself from
being wide-eyed with a combination of shock and fear. Looking over his
shoulder he could see Cordelia and the two slayers were in a similar
state. The slayers seemed as frightened as he was as they held hands.
As he turned back to the stage he tried to block out the sight of his
childe Spike in the middle of his rendition of the Billy Idol song
"White Wedding" singing with an alarming abandon. Cordelia was the
first to regain the power of speech. "Shouldn't that chip be going
off?" Buffy couldn't pull her eyes from the stage as she responded
over her shoulder. "I guess it only applies to him hurting humans
physically." A voice that Buffy didn't recognize replied to her
questions. "Meeeow, I don't suppose you would care to take a shot? Of
course I'm talking to a slayer so I suppose I should be more careful
with my words."</p>

<p>A taller, green skinned demon in a sharp white suit took a
drink from his drink as he sat down at their table. "Welcome to
Caritas. While I had always thought a slayer might stop by I never
thought it could be under such pleasant circumstances." Angel then
turned to him. "Actually it's not all that pleasant. We need
information." He gave the vampire a smile. "What more do you need? The
lawyers have the guardian wrapped up in red tape and it needs your
help to get out." "So the Sentinel is there?" He nodded simply and
both Cordelia and Angel looked skeptical as Cordelia spoke. "You don't
normally GIVE information away." He smiled at her. "Consider it a
gift. Though if the slayers would be good enough to grace us with a
song?'" The question was left hanging at the two girls looked at each
other while he spoke again. "I'm personally curious to see what I pick
up when I look at two slayers when there is only supposed to be one."
That got the girls attention as he stood up. "Now if you'll excuse me
it looks like Billy the Bloody is finished."</p>

<p>They all looked at each other as Faith spoke. "I just realized
that. I mean not only does he have the hair and the accent, but his
first name COULD be shortened to Billy." They all shuddered as they
forced themselves to drop the topic and look back at the stage.
"William, William, William, that was fantastic! You have the soul of a
poet!" Spike first looked alarmed and then nudged his way in front of
the microphone. "That's Spike, and I don't have a soul." There was a
round of laughter at that from the rest of the room. The slayers
didn't see Spike walk off stage because a spotlight was shined in
their faces. Faith leapt to her feet and took a defensive posture but
the light moved so it shone on the table in front of them instead of
in their eyes.</p>

<p>"Now we have some VERY special guests with us here tonight.
I'm sure we've all heard that this generation has doubled up on its
slayers." At that the rest of the room seemed to start taking
defensive postures but the host held up his hands. "Now, now, remember
our policies. The slayer have agreed to them." As the room started to
settle back down he continued. "I'm just wondering if the slayer's
would honor us with a song?" His voice then got both soft and sly. "A
duet perhaps?" The girls looked at him, and then at each other. They
kept looking at each other until Buffy sighed. "I'll go." Cordelia and
Angel were both grinning along with Faith, but Buffy turned back and
smiled sweetly at her girlfriend. "You're next sweetheart." Faith's
smile soured while Angel's and Cordelia's grew. </p>

<p>The smaller slayer got a determined look on her face as she
walked up to the stage and began searching through the song lists. She
pointed at a title and nodded once. The host had already walked over
to share a both with Spike so one of the human employees entered some
commands into a machine next to the stage. Buffy took some breaths to
steady herself and then stepped up to the microphone. She gave Faith a
shy smile, which surprised everyone at the table. When she heard the
song started she smiled softly thinking Buffy was singing her a love
song, and while in a way she was the dark slayer found her eyes
getting wide as the song continued.</p>

<p>"I watch her from my balcony."<br>
"As she dresses for their fantasies."<br>
"Men come to see her demonstrate,"<br>
"Her skills of pleasure."<br>
"Seal their fate."</p>

<p>"I can believe in pain,"<br>
"As leather bound they fall."<br>
"They seem to go insane,"<br>
"In ecstasy they call."<br>
"She lets them know,"<br>
"That she's a mistress of the night."<br>
"As they submit to gain primitive new heights."</p>

<p>"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"If she could only see how she's getting to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I've gotta give her a sign cause I've got danger on my mind now."</p>

<p>"I watch her from the balcony,"<br>
"As she plays them like a symphony."<br>
"They all bow as she makes them wait."<br>
"I want her, but I hesitate."</p>

<p>"But she deceives them all,"<br>
"As girlfriends sometimes call."<br>
"But if they only knew the ladies she pursues." <br>
"Then her emotions stir as twilight girls arrive."<br>
"They range from butch to femme,"<br>
"And they play all night."</p>

<p>"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"If she could only see how she's getting to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I've gotta give her a sign cause I've got danger on my mind now."</p>

<p>"I passed her on the street to day."<br>
"She brushed by me and looked my way."<br>
"There was a breath of innocence."<br>
"I knew this girl was different- oh yeah."</p>

<p>"Cruel and unusual."<br>
"Cruel and unusual."<br>
"Danger on my mind."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"If she could only see what she is doing to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I've gotta give her a sign cause I've got danger on my mind."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I wanna play all night."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"What she's doin to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"Danger on my mind."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."</p>

<p>Since everyone's attention was focused on the singing slayer they
didn't what Spike was saying or what was being said to him. "They make
a cute couple don't they?" Spike shrugged. "Sexy is more like it, but
yeah they do go well together." "Doesn't mean you're not needed."
Spike's head pulled back. "What's that mean?" A smile was Spike's
first response, but the demon elaborated. "Don't be coy now. You've
fought three slayers, but only managed to kill two?" He made a
scoffing sound. "Yeah, but that's just because of her poor taste in
men." "So what? She isn't dating men anymore." Spike took a drink from
his beer. "Yeah and I can't kill anymore." "Are you saying that you
would if you could?" He laughed as he took another drink. "Are you
kidding? I could get a two for one!" This time Spike was given a
smirk. "Sure you could William."</p>

<p>The smirk remained and Spike started getting aggravated. "I could,
kill one, make the other so distraught she wouldn't even care when I
ripped her throat out." The host got up. "Who are you trying to
convince?" As he turned and walked away Spike spoke to his back. "I
could I tell you. Just two more to me' nothing special bout her, bout
either of them." He didn't notice Spike as he stepped on stage as
Buffy finished her song. "Wow, wow, wow! That was HOT! Let's get a
round of applause for Buffy the Vampire Slayer!" There was applause
and they were surprisingly enthusiastic. For her part Buffy smiled and
actually blushed slightly though it was nothing compared to the way
Faith was blushing as Buffy sat back down next to her. Cordelia chose
that moment to speak. "Wow is right." Angel seemed uncomfortable, but
he still spoke. "You reconsidering that whole girlfriend thing?"</p>

<p>"Well'" Cordelia's answer was cut off abruptly. "Now, can we get a
song from your sweetheart?" Faith found herself hauled to her feet by
Buffy. "Yes, yes you can." Buffy then kissed Faith on the cheek. "Your
turn honey. "Spike had gotten back to the table at that point but his
expression seemed haunted as he spoke to Faith. "Careful there, you're
looking paler then I am." Spike managed a grin as Faith glared over
her shoulder at him. She then took a breath, clenched her fists and
strode up to the stage. She was able to pick her song right away and
stepped up to the mic just as quickly, but when she started singing
she added her typically seductive dancing with the microphone stand as
her partner.</p>

<p>"You think you're in love."<br>
"Like it's a real sure thing."<br>
"But every time you fall,"<br>
"You get your ass in a sling."<br>
"You used to be strong,"<br>
"But now its "Oh baby please."<br>
"Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"We was making love when you told me that you loved me."<br>
"I thought ol cupid, he was taking aim."<br>
"I was believing when you told me that you loved me,"<br>
"And then you called me someone else's name."</p>

<p>"There ain't gonna be no more begin your please."<br>
"You know what I want and it ain't one of these."<br>
"Your bad to the bone and your girlfriend agrees."<br>
"That falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"Chip off the old block and your so much like your sister."<br>
"My fantasizing must be out of luck."<br>
"My own libido has been blowing a transistor."<br>
"I feel like I have been hit by a fuck."</p>

<p>"I'm jonesing on love."<br>
"Yeah I've got the disease."<br>
"You say that we will,"<br>
"But there ain't no guarantees."<br>
"I majored in love,"<br>
"But in all minor keys."<br>
"Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?"<br>
"It's got to be hardcore."<br>
"Must be some kind of Nevus Riche."<br>
"Is this your only chance?"<br>
"Or some hypnotic trance."<br>
"Let's get you on a tighter leash."</p>

<p>"You ain't that good." is what you said down to the letter."<br>
"But you like the way I hold a microphone."<br>
"Sometimes I'm good,"<br>
"But when I'm bad I'm even better."<br>
"Don't give me no lip,<br>
"I've got enough of my own."</p>

<p>"There ain't gonna be no more begin your please."<br>
"You know what I want and it ain't one of these."<br>
"Your bad to the bone and your girlfriend agrees."<br>
"That falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"I'm jonesing on love."<br>
"Yeah I've got the disease."<br>
"You say that we will,"<br>
"But there ain't no guarantees."<br>
"I majored in love,"<br>
"But in all minor keys."<br>
"Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>As the song ended Faith was left flushed, smiling from ear to ear and
panting ever so slightly. The host quickly walked up and took the
microphone. "Now wasn't that great!" Under his breath, but close to
the mic he spoke to Faith. "The censoring is there for a reason."
Faith then laughed. "What, murderous demons are afraid of the f word?"
"Yes" She shrugged. "Whatever." Then she walked from the stage and
back to a widely grinning Buffy. "I know it got me thinking of my f
word." Faith slid her arms over the smaller slayer's shoulders and
then leaned in and whispered in Buffy's ear. "Would that word
be'Faith?" Buffy pulled back and grinned at her. "That too." Faith
grin matched Buffy's as they sat back down and Buffy spoke. "Let's
just say we'll be testing your theory, and those knees."</p>

<p>The sound of a chair scraping across the floor turned all eyes to
Angel who was on his feet and back towards the exit. "I' I gotta go."
The host was there at almost the exact same time. "Maybe you should go
with him Cordelia?" The secretary turned seer nodded and quickly
followed her boss out the door. The slayers looked about ready to do
the same as the host held up a hand. "Don't, he's a big boy, and he
has to learn to deal with it." Spike sighed dramatically. "I guess
I'll go help the poor guy out." Buffy shook her head. "The only help
you would give is twisting the knife." He nodded. "Your right there.
Fine, I'll go help myself to another beer." As Spike got up and headed
to the bar the three were left alone. "I know you girls are worried
about him, but it's the nature of his curse. He has to earn the right
to happiness." </p>

<p>Faith was looking down at the table. "I didn't." "Ah, but there's a
difference there. That's what I saw. You two know that you are each
halves of the slayer power right?" The girls nodded in unison, and he
smiled. "Part of that is that you share your karma. So Buffy, when
Kendra died you shed your slayer duties. You thought it was just
because you couldn't handle it, but on an instinctive level you knew
that there should be a new slayer." Buffy seemed to consider that.
"After I' died I had this whole bad girl phase." Faith seemed to pout.
"And I missed it?" They all seemed to laugh at that. "Actually "you"
probably were the cause of it." The slayers locked their eyes back on
him in a silent question. "Well Buffy as you know your power fractured
at that point and the darker side of the slayer powers passed on to
Kendra. On a subconscious level you knew they were missing and your
acting up was a way to try to make up for the loss."</p>

<p>Faith was confused. "So what's that got to do with me?" He smiled at
her and reached out to pat her hand. "I'm getting to you precious.
When you were doing what you did you wanted Buffy to stop you didn't
you?" Faith nodded. "I just figured that was because I still had some
trace of a conscience." He nodded. "I'm sure you did, but Angel was
trying to stop you to. You wanted Buffy to do it because you knew she
was the only one. She mitigates your darkness, and you give her the
fire to keep fighting. Without you Buffy losses the fire for the
fight, with out her you'" Faith interrupted. "Flip out?" "Not exactly.
Your slayer instincts tend to think in terms before the development of
things like laws." The girls continued to look at him and he sighed.
"When you first took a life your slayer instincts thought "threat" and
reacted. Now in this case it turned out to be wrong. Now Buffy's
verified what he was, but if he had turned out to be a threat she
could have died while making sure."</p>

<p>Buffy's lip curled. "So what? We're both flawed?" He shook his head.
"No, you're linked. You need each other to be at full strength." Faith
was looking back down at the table. "She was with me when it first
happened." He stared deeply into her eyes. "Was she?" The girls looked
at each other for a long time and then back at the demonic lounge
singer. Buffy then spoke in a quiet voice. "You mean to be together we
have to be "together"?" He grinned at the girls. "Not exactly, but the
connection has to be on a deep, primal level. Rites of passage,
ritualistic combat, vision quests, things like that. Sex is just one
of the things that connect on that level that is still popular
nowadays. So the stronger your love the stronger your slaying."</p>

<p>"I must say, you have an extraordinary talent for the
supernatural." Wesley noticed that Tara seemed uncomfortable with the
compliment, but he just assumed that it was because of the girl's shy
nature. She did however smile. "T...thank you." He smiled as he sat
down next to her. The two Watchers were working with the Wiccan and
the former vengeance demon while the rest of the combined team was out
doing legwork. They were responsible for going through Wesley's
library as well as looking over the books they brought with them in
greater detail. "Though I understand you are actually practicing?" She
nodded as he continued. "That was forbidden back in England, not at
all proper you know." She looked at him with an odd look. "You mean
you spent all those hours in the library with the books you loved but
were never curious about what was inside?"</p>

<p>Wesley seemed rather uncomfortable. "Well… yes. I mean I
assume most experimented at one point or another, but not to the point
or finding a partner or working spells on any regular basis. I mean an
exorcism here or there as needed, but we were taught to stay well away
from it." Tara's expression grew sad. "That's sad. I mean if you have
an aptitude for magic… I mean I do and the magic I work with Willow…
well I've never been happier." He seemed to look serious. "And the
Watcher's Council would condemn you for it." Then he smiled. "Good
thing I'm no longer a Watcher." She smiled back at him as Anya came
bursting in. "You can talk about Wesley's hang ups later." He stood
up. "I beg your pardon?" Anya waved a hand at him. "You can beg me
later. Your library has reference to the Sentinel!" Tara stood up on
impulse as well as the three of them moved to look at the scroll Anya
was holding. As Wesley got close he took off his glasses. </p>

<p>"I recognize that. Angel managed to bring it back with the
prophecy." The two girls looked at him and nearly spoke in unison.
"Prophecy?" Wesley looked like a deer caught in the headlights, but he
shook himself immediately. "Nothing, just an unrelated prophecy that's
part of an ongoing investigation." The blondes looked skeptical, but
seemed willing to drop the issue as Tara spoke. "We should tell Mr.
Giles." Wesley nodded. "Quite right." He then led the two over to
where Rupert Giles was pouring through an ancient tome, which was
lying next to a rather large pile of similar books. As they approached
they were not at all quiet about it and Giles looked up at them. "Did
you find something?" Tara was smiling. "Yep, we found something. Well
Anya found something. What did we find?" At that she tried to look
over at the scroll but Anya was unrolling it on the table that Giles
was working at.</p>

<p>"I found the spell that they used to bind the Sentinel." Giles
took his glasses off and began reading the scroll, and as he got more
and more amazed Anya looked more and more pleased with herself. "Yes,
yes that's exactly what you found, and with this we will be able to
figure out how to counter it." Wesley looked over the scroll at the
same time. "Does that mean that we will still need to penetrate the
Wolfram and Heart offices?" Giles nodded "I'm afraid it does. What
this scroll does is guarantee that if we can get to the Sentinel we
can free it and quite quickly I might add." Tara had managed to
squeeze into a spot close enough to look at the scroll. "Willow and I
can start working as soon as they get back."</p>

<p>At that precise moment the doors opened to admit Xander, Gunn
and Willow. Giles, Wesley and Anya all locked at Tara with shocked
expressions. Tara seemed shocked as well, but she was smiling as she
laid eyes on Willow. When Willow laid eyes on Tara she sped up her
pace and quickly wrapped Tara in a hug. A tight one if Tara's grunt
was any indication. Anya seemed ready to do the same, but when she got
close to Xander she stopped. "Xander, you stink. Why do you stink?" He
shrugged slightly. "Cordite." She looked confused. "Cordite, what's
cordite?" Giles stood as he heard that. "Cordite? What happened?" Anya
interrupted Xander's reply. "What happened? What's cordite? And why
does your shirt have holes?" Xander sighed warily. "Cordite is the
blue smoke left after gunpowder ignites." Anya grabbed Xander and
started running her hands over him to look for wounds, something Tara
started to do to Willow. "Gunpowder! You were shot?" </p>

<p>Xander nodded. "Several times, but the vest stopped em."
Willow caught Tara's hands and then kissed her. "I'm fine. Xander
protected me." She smiled over at her friend as Tara clutched her to
her chest, also smiling at Xander but her face was pale while she
mouthed the words "thank you". He smiled back at the two of them. "Now
if you don't mind I'd like to sit down." Willow agreed. "Yes, sitting,
sitting is good." As they all moved to the couches in the lobby Giles
and Wesley looked at Gunn, for his part the man shrugged. "Don't look
at me. I was just the wheelman. It was those two going Wild West in
there." Both Anya and Tara were thinking alike as they refused to let
go of their respective lovers while Xander resumed the narrative. As
he finished their listeners all seemed shocked. Giles was the first to
express it.</p>

<p>"You killed human beings?" Xander looked directly into his
eyes. "I killed the enemy." Giles shook his head. "But they were still
human beings." Xander kept the gaze locked. "So? Should we let them
keep this Sentinel imprisoned? Or maybe we should have just let them
catch me and Willow and then take us someplace private to put a bullet
in the back of our heads?" Anya spoke up. "I don't like that idea."
Xander actually grinned and gave her a kiss. "Me neither, and that's
why I killed them. I wasn't willing to die, and I wasn't willing to
let them keep doing evil. That's the thing Giles. We are not talking
dupes or pawns, they were not innocent. They went into this with their
eyes open and CHOSE to serve the forces of darkness, and when I last
checked that's who we were fighting."</p>

<p>Giles looked sad. "Yes, but where's the line?" "The line is
that I didn't like it. In fact I hated it, I know full well I am going
to loose sleep over this, but I will be around to loose that sleep."
Tara was rubbing up and down Willow's arms. "What about you?" Willow
sighed and snuggled against Tara's shoulder. "I didn't have to do
anything, not really. It was just a matter of seeing what Xander had
to do." Xander looked ready to apologize, but she raised her head and
shook it. "It's ok Xander. It's like you said. We had to stop them,
and the only way we could do that was killing them. I'm going to loose
some sleep too, but living with it still has that whole living part."
With that she snuggled back against Tara who actually seemed to be
rocking her slightly." Xander had been looking at Willow, but he
looked back at Giles.</p>

<p>"And that's the best way to say it. We'll learn to live with
it, but we have to be alive to do so, and just because their human
doesn't mean they can't do evil." Giles nodded. "That is true."
"That's all true, but you'll still need to see how well you live with
it." The gathered group looked over to see Angel and Cordelia
entering. Xander shrugged. "I feel bad about having to kill, but I
don't feel bad about surviving. If they had given me another option I
would have taken it." Angel was sullen but he nodded as Giles asked
Angel and Cordelia a question. "Where are Buffy and Faith?" Both
seemed to get a soured expression as they answered in unison. "With
Spike." That seemed to spread the soured disposition to everyone in
the room.  Willow looked absolutely shocked. "You left them, in LA,
with Spike?" The two looked abashed, but nodded.</p>

<p>Giles looked sickened while Xander spoke. "I'm not sure who we
should be more worried about, Spike, or Faith. Either way I think
Buffy is in trouble." Giles nodded. "Either way I think it is safe to
say they will not be back till the early morning. Shall we retire?"
They all nodded and began standing up. The Scooby gang nodded and
started heading for the stairs while Angel investigations moved
towards the doors. All of them saying various goodnights. As Willow
and Tara got to their room Tara seemed to keep examining Willow with
her eyes. "Are you sure you're ok?" Willow nodded and smiled slightly.
"Yeah, I'm ok. I just want a shower." Tara's voice was quiet as she
spoke. "Want some company?" Willow smiled uncontrollably as she
blushed and nodded. </p>

<p>Both of the girls undressed and put their clothes aside. Both
naked, they padded into the bathroom and stepped into the shower
stall. Tara stood behind Willow and reached around her to turn on the
water. As the spray started hitting them she took the sponge and
lathered it up. Running it over Willow's shoulders and down her spine
she felt Willow shudder as she sighed happily. "So what happened?"
Willow's head slumped forward and Tara stepped closer to wrap a free
hand around Willow's waist. She wasn't sure if she was going to get an
answer until Willow started to speak. "It's hard to remember. I mean
it all happened so fast. I mean first Xander maced to guys and beat
them up in the office we were using. Then we got out in the hall and
they started shooting at us, so Xander shot back." Tara kissed
Willow's shoulder in silent support as she continued speaking.</p>

<p>"Then we heard them over the radio saying they were entering
the stairs so we tried getting out of them, but that was a trap cause
they shot Xander." While her first shudder and been one of pleasure at
the soft touches the one that went through her this time was at the
pain of the memory. "I thought he was dead Tara. I thought they had
killed him. I thought that I was all alone and I would never get out
there." Tara set the sponge aside and pulled Willow into her arms. She
nestled Willow to her bosom and stroked the red head's damp hair. At
first all Willow was able to do was cling to Tara and try to calm her
breathing. She managed to do that and looked up into Tara's eyes. "I
love you." Tara's eyes looked back into Willow's. "I love you too." A
statement that she punctuated with a kiss. Willow turned back around
and Tara resumed scrubbing her back.</p>

<p>"But he was wearing a vest and he was ok. So he shot them." At
this point Tara had finished with the back and moved to scrub Willow's
front. Starting at the top she ran the sponge around Willow's breasts,
something that caused an abrupt stop to the story. She stopped.
"Sorry." Willow's voice seemed dreamy. "No… it's all right." The small
grin on her girlfriend's face appeared on Tara's as well. While she
started making gentle circles on Willow's abdomen the story continued.
"So he shot them, and we made our way to the fire stairs." There was a
pause and a deep breath. "But they found us there too, and Xander used
a grenade." Willow shuddered again. "Before it was just people
falling. I mean we were running and so I never really looked at them,
but there, there I slipped in the blood. That caused Tara to look and
she noticed the nasty bruise on Willow's knee. She scrubbed the
abdomen another couple times and then knelt down. </p>

<p>There she began scrubbing Willow's legs, paying extra special
attention to the injured area. "I, I asked Xander for his can of mace
because I didn't want to just put it on him. I was going to fight to
get back to you." Tara tossed her hair back over her shoulder as she
looked up and smiled at Willow. Smiling back at her Willow kept
speaking. "We managed to get down to the parking garage, and Gunn was
there, but a security team had tried to stop him. He had managed to
get five of them, but the sixth had his gun at Gunn's head. So Xander
kept him distracted while I snuck up and maced him. Gunn hit the guy
and we all got in his truck and headed back here." Tara had reached
the point she was scrubbing Willow's thighs and had her other hand at
the small of Willow's back to brace herself as she looked up. "You
came back to me." Willow had seemed to stop breathing as the muscles
in her thighs tensed. "Tara? Can we go to bed? I… I need you." Tara
stood up and shut off the water. Taking Willow by the hand she led her
from the shower. "Let's go to bed."</p>

<p>In another room in the hotel a similar process was going on.
"What's that? I thought you said the vest stopped the bullets?" Xander
nodded and ran his hand over his chest, which carried roughly half a
dozen quarter-sized bruises. "It did stop them, but they were going
very fast when they stopped." Anya looked at him with her face twisted
in a pout. "I don't like this Xander. I don't like you being in
situations that could take you away from me." He pulled her into his
arms and kissed her forehead. "I don't like being in those situations,
but I've been fighting evil for five years now, and I don't see myself
stopping." She turned from him and crossed her arms over her chest. He
stepped up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist. "Think of
it like this. The Xander you fell in love with fought evil. If I
didn't fight evil would I still be your Xander?"</p>

<p>She turned around and kissed his bare chest. "You smell much
better after your shower, and you will always be my Xander." His hands
rubbed up and down her back. "Yes, but would I be the Xander you fell
in love with?" Her face scrunched up. "Well… I guess not." He smiled.
"Go take your shower. I'm going to get ready for bed." She smiled at
him and went into the bathroom. After she left and he heard the water
start running he allowed out the groan he had been holding back. Sure
the vest kept the bullets from entering his body but they still felt
like supersonic punches to the chest. He had already taken off the
vest and had determined it was still useable, but he decided that
after this mission was over he was going to have to look into
procuring another one.</p>

<p>The vest was already soaking to remove the combined stinks of
his sweat and the cordite so he started taking the guns apart and
using the cleanser on them. He had managed to score a position in
logistics, and with the help of Willow's computer skills and the
overall cumbersome bureaucracy he was able to siphon off the supplies
he needed. Now he was trying to think of where a vest could go missing
with out being missed. All the while he kept maintaining his equipment
with an efficiency that went beyond his conscious thoughts. Yet he
didn't think it was all because of Ethan Rayne's spell. It felt too
right to just be the magic. Of course maybe that was part of the
spell, he DID become an entirely different personality, but he didn't
when he used the skills. Sure the knowledge got dumped in at once, but
it felt like it was his. Of course maybe the spell just took over his
personality more then it did Buffy or Willow.</p>

<p>He shook his head and forced his mind off that train of
thought. The fact was he had assimilated the skills, and he was
putting them to good use. Maybe Ethan made him into a killing machine,
or maybe he had just unlocked Xander's inner solider. The fact was
that he was a solider, literally now a member of the United States
Armed Forces. Even more then that he was part of an operation that saw
action almost every night and was fighting for a great cause, all of
humanity. The one thing he did know is that whatever Ethan had done to
him it had went far beyond some supernatural Halloween prank. As he
finished assembling his gear he loaded a clip into his pistol and
thought that the next time he saw Ethan Rayne maybe he could show the
evil wizard just how far it had gone. He got under the covers and let
out a huge sigh of contentment. Anya had yet to return from her
shower, and while she didn't like it when he fell asleep with out her
he thought the battle with his fatigue was one he was going to loose.</p>
