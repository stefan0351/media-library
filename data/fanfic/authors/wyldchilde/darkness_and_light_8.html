<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 8 -->

<p>"Where have you been?" Buffy couldn't help but grin at her
roommate as Willow's initial exclamation degenerated into babbling.
"Well ok, mom tone aside. We beeped you awhile ago!"  Buffy sat down
at the desk. "Yeah, I got it, but I was already at the mansion."
Willow's eyes got wide. "Oh?" Buffy gave her friend a pointed gaze.
"You knew Riley was following me, didn't you?" Willow sat down on the
edge of the bed across from Buffy. "Well, not really "following you"
but that he was in a general "I'll do Buffy's thinking for her." Frame
of mind." As Buffy replied she couldn't keep from sighing. "That about
sums it up. He follows me to the mansion, and then gets into a fist
fight with Faith." Willow looked worried. "Did she?" Buffy shook her
head. "Riley was the one lurking in the bushes. Got into a big fight.
He seemed to think that since Faith managed to seduce him that I was
no match for her."</p>

<p>Willow scoffed. "That's ridiculous! You've been Faith's match
ever since she got here!" When Buffy gave Willow a questioning look
the redhead blushed. "I mean match in the able take anything she could
give. In mean in the fighting sense NOT in the smooching sense." When
Buffy seemed unable to look Willow in the face Willow's eyes narrowed.
"Or do I? Where there smoochies?" Buffy blushed. "One, one smoochie
one very long, very naked smoochie." "You were naked?" Buffy shook her
head, as she blushed further. "No, Faith was naked. I walked into the
shower with out thinking." Willow's smile grew sly. "So… how was it?"
Buffy's chest rose as she breathed in deep. "It was… unbelievable. I
mean I love Riley, but I haven't been kissed like that since Angel."</p>

<p>Willow grinned. "You sure do have a thing for the bad boys…
and girls." Buffy's eyes opened. "I do not! The girl thing is not an
issue. I mean it's… Faith. Ok, Faith is girl shaped, but that's not an
issue." Willow looked overly innocent. "So you didn't like what you
saw? Not one bit?" Buffy blushed, but didn't reply, and Willow
developed a rather devious grin. "Come on Buffy. Think about who
you're talking to." Buffy smiled slightly as she shook her head. "I
know, preaching to the converted, but you know me Willow I mean not
only have I gone for guys. I've gone for the brawny guys, Angel,
Riley, even Owen had that broad shoulder thing going." "Maybe you like
your girls for contrast, or maybe you were just overcompensating."
Buffy rolled her eyes. "What girls Will? Girl, one, singular."</p>

<p>Willow kept grinning. "A chosen one huh?" Buffy arched her
eyebrows dangerously, but it simply caused Willow's grin to grow. She
kept grinning as she stood up. "I should probably call Giles he was
the one who suggested we page you." She was interrupted however as
Buffy stood up with her. "I'll do it. I need to schedule some training
time for me and Faith in the morning anyway." Willow grinned and
nodded as she stepped away, only speaking while Buffy dialed. "So a
training date?" Buffy scowled at a still grinning Willow as she heard
the receiver pick up. "Hello?" With out even thinking about it Buffy
smiled at her watcher's voice. "Hey Giles, just calling to say I'm
home and everything's fine." The normally cool tones shoe with obvious
relief. "Buffy, good. Did Riley find you?" She nodded silently even
though she knew the gesture was wasted. </p>

<p>"Yeah, Faith caught him playing peeping tom." Giles reply
sounded slightly shocked. "What?" "Faith discovered someone was
watching us. When she went out to see who it was she found Riley.
Blah, blah, blah, big fight, Riley went home." His voice was now more
curious then concerned. "Now when you say big fight do you mean thrown
words? Or thrown fists?" Buffy squirmed; again knowing it had no
effect. "Both actually, he took a swing at Faith and I took a shout at
him. Speaking of which, I kinda told Faith we should meet at your
place in the morning for some training." The Englishman actually
seemed both surprised and pleased at that. "Yes, that would be lovely.
So Faith will be staying with us?" "Yeah, you'll have two slayers to
have to keep track of." He actually sounded pleased for his first
sentence. "I will expect you both bright and early. We will also want
to consider the reaction of Mr. Finn." </p>

<p>The tone had darkened for the last part and it had transmitted
right to Buffy. "I know. I'm going to have to talk to him. He's going
to have to see that Faith has a place here." "What if he refuses?"
Buffy's voice had a trace of its slayer steel. "He wont." Her voice
softened again. "I'll see you in the morning Giles." She hung up the
phone after his reply of "Goodnight Buffy." She didn't bother turning
to Willow. "You can wipe the smirk off your face." Willow was still
smirking but she was also trying unsuccessfully to look innocent.
"Jeez Will. You keep this up and people really will think you are
trying to convert me." Will scrunched her face back up. "It's not
that. Like you said, you haven't been this excited since Angel."
"Woah, woah, I never said that." Willow made a dismissive gesture.
"Still Buffy, this is someone who excites you, and I want to support
that this time."</p>

<p>Buffy sat down next to Willow. "What do you mean?" Willow hung
her head in shame. "When Faith first got here I was jealous of the
time you two spent together." First Buffy looked shocked. "Oh no
Buffy, not like THAT. I mean I thought I was loosing my best friend. I
didn't get it then. I didn't get it until I met Tara." Buffy remained
silent, but her face seemed to ask for more. "I didn't realize what it
feels like to have someone who just gets you. I mean sure you have the
friends and the family, and they try to understand, but like with me
and Tara. She just understands me. That's what you have with Faith,
were both witches, your both slayers. Tara and I are both shy; you're
both outgoing. I mean sure there are differences, but what would be
the point of being with them if you were identical?" </p>

<p>She nodded as they both wordlessly got ready for bed, but her
actions were done on autopilot as she thought about Willow's words.
Her and Faith were a lot alike. Approximately the same age, kind of
the same personalities, both slayers. Of course they were also both
girls. While Buffy considered herself a 21st century gal there was a
big difference between accepting your roommate is bi and accepting you
might be as well. Yet every time she tried to talk herself out of it
she flashed back to Faith, specifically Faith fresh from the shower.
There was no way for Buffy to deny it, she liked it, more then liked
it she loved it. The look, the smooth skin and soft, yet well defined
curves. She loved the scent, clean, healthy, and desiring Buffy as
much as Buffy was desiring her. </p>

<p>She didn't allow herself to linger on when she touched Faith's
naked flesh, let alone when she pressed herself to it, but found she
could think of little else as Willow shut off the light. Faith was
thinking similar thoughts as she laid down to sleep. Could it be that
all she had to do was be honest? She knew that when she kissed Buffy,
Buffy kissed back, and it had all the energy and life that had first
drawn her to Buffy. Could it be that honesty would have saved her all
the heartbreak, given her a chance at the life reality had denied her
so far? Faith wasn't sure, but the feel of being in Buffy's arms told
her she was on the right track.</p>

<p>Yet while the slayers started to dream Spike knew there was no
rest for the wicked. Of course William the Bloody had went from as
wicked as he wants to be to as wicked as he's allowed to be.  As
allowed as some damn peace of technology let him be. He took comfort
in the fact that it was a machine and would break down eventually, but
the fact was he had never been patient as a mortal, and had not
learned any patience after he became a member of the undead. He wanted
the damn thing out NOW. The futuristic Frankenstein Adam had promised
to remove it, but got caught up in getting his technological heart
ripped out by Buffy. "Teaches me right for making a deal with a demon,
even a puzzle piece one." While Spike was talking to himself he wasn't
worried about being overheard.</p>

<p>He knew that the slayer was tucked away in her dorm room with
her little Wiccan friend, because people may have called Spike
violent, brutal, and possibly thickheaded they never called him dumb.
His bastard of a sire Angelus had beaten any dumb out of him in
Spike's first half decade of undeath. Considering he had no real way
of defending himself from the Slayer he contented himself with keeping
an eye on her movements. Sure it wasn't precise, but in times like
this it allowed him a certain measure of freedom, because while the
slayer slept most of Sunnydale's demons still hid, just thinking she
would jump out and strike them down. It still amused him to think
about it. One tight arsed, tiny blonde and they acted like she was
some damn avenging angel.</p>

<p>Of course after storming the Initiative Spike thought they
might be right, but he had survived a tangle or two with the slayer,
and he wasn't afraid. Of course with the chip in the head he wasn't
her archnemesis, he was her damn lap dog. Worse off then Angel because
Angel had a soul that wanted to be her lap dog, Spike had just been
put on the leash. His musings were interrupted as he passed by the
mansion, the place where he spent months recovering from the Slayer
bringing down the roof right on his head. Of course it was also the
spot Buffy first brought him to heel by getting him to attack his
sire. While he actually enjoyed the hitting his sire part he didn't
like that it helped the slayer, but his sire was such an ass it
actually gave them something to agree on. </p>

<p>What worried him was the fact that the mansion seemed active
again. He could see the furniture's dust covers were gone, and some
window's were even open. Which was perfect in his mind because Angel
hadn't been living in centuries and wouldn't be safe from Spike even
in his current condition. The old hunting skills returned immediately
as Spike inched closer. He stopped on the edge of the property line
looking over the place. The memories of his sire, and Dru were pushed
back into his memory as he looked for traps, or alarms or snares. He
didn't know what Angel would plan, but the gaining of a soul hadn't
done anything to his sire's tactical ability. Of course then he
noticed there was no car and figured Angel was probably out covering
patrol for Buffy. So he decided to head on in and set a trap of his
own.</p>

<p>As he approached the window he stretched his hand out towards
the windowsill and ran smack into the invisible barrier that damned
all of his kind. He turned abruptly as she heard footsteps behind him.
He looked into the sneering face of Riley Finn. "You're getting rusty
Hostile Seventeen." Spike straightened out and threw his shoulders
back. "Kind of stupid to call me a name given by a place that no
longer exists." Riley shrugged. "Yeah but its legacy still lives on
inside your head." Spike snorted and took out a cigarette. He was half
way to lighting it as Riley spoke again. "How would you like it out?"
Spike paused a second, and then lit. "And how would that happen? When
I saw you in uniform it was not a white lab coat." Riley nodded.
"True, but you forget who assistant I was. I removed my own control
chip with a broken piece of glass, but I don't even need to do that. I
can shut it off with a signal."</p>

<p>Spike blew a puff of smoke. "Now why would you want to do
something like that?" Riley shrugged. "It was the whole point of the
Initiative. Use monsters to fight monsters, both foreign and
domestic." Spike laughed. "Ahh so I would have been some sort of super
assassin?" Again Riley shrugged. "Something like that. It was the
first design where would couldn't have killed a living being unless we
allowed you." Spike grinned. "Now what would your slayer sweetheart
say about that?" Riley shook his head. "She doesn't need to know, and
she never will. Now, do you want to be able to kill again or not?"
Spike held his cigarette between his first two fingers and shook them
at Riley. "Lemme guess, you figure you'll set ol Spike loose on
someone, and then kill me before I can hurt anyone you don't want me
to?"</p>

<p>Riley didn't respond and Spike grinned as he took a drag off
his cigarette. "You got it soldier boy. Who dies?" Riley didn't blink.
"Faith." Spike did blink. "Faith? The other slayer." Riley nodded once
as Spike spoke. "Ahh, afraid she'll kick your ass if you faced her
yourself didn't you?" When he saw Riley's angry flush at his words he
laughed. "She already did! Well you got it soldier boy. Shut off the
chip I'll drive on up to where ever she is and get a third slayer
under my belt." Riley shook his head. "She's in there. That's why you
can't get in. Angel has pretty much given her the place so it's a new
owner, new house, and a new invitation." "All right, all right, bit of
a challenge, but I like a challenge. Now… SHUT OFF THE DAMN CHIP!" </p>

<p>Riley held up his hands. "Spike, Spike you're going to wake
Faith up." Spike growled quietly. "Shut off the chip and I'll be as
quiet as a bloody Church mouse." Riley nodded. "The reason I picked
you is because despite your being a demon you do have some odd sense
of honor. You kept your word with Buffy. Will you give it to me?"
Spike rolled his eyes and held his fingers up in a Boy Scout salute.
"Vampire's honor. Now turn off the chip!" Riley seemed reluctant, but
he took a device out of his pocket and pressed a button. Spike
suddenly felt a pressure release inside his head and automatically
shifted into game face. Riley saw that and stepped back, which caused
Spike's visage to get all the more terrifying as it smiled. "Don't
worry Riley. I'll kill Faith for you. Then I'll turn her. Split you
and blondie between us." Riley's expression darkened and he reached
inside his jacket, but they were both interrupted as they heard the
voice of Faith. "Some of us are trying to get some sleep!"</p>
