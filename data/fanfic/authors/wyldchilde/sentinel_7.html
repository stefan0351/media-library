<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 7 -->

<p>As Buffy slipped out from under Spike's arm she gave him an
elbow to the ribs. While he grunted from the pain Faith slipped out
from under his arm but gave him a grin as she did so. The vampire
rubbed his ribs and gave the slayers an injured look. "Can you blame
me, LA, to unbelievably hot women with me? It's what dreams are made
of." While Buffy cocked a brow at him Faith nodded thoughtfully. Upon
seeing that Buffy turned her brow on Faith and the dark haired slayer
grinned at her partner. Buffy shook her head and hid her eyes behind
her right hand. "Oh great, there's two of you." Spike and Faith shared
a grin. Then both of them went to one of Buffy's arms and held her
hands. While Buffy allowed her girlfriend to continue she yanked her
hand free from Spike. "Only those I'm dating can hold my hand." Spike
then smirked and reached for her hand again but got his foot stomped
on by Faith. He leapt back on his uninjured foot and growled.</p>

<p>Faith simply grinned. "Sorry Spike, but you only hurt the ones
you love." Spike shook his head. "Yeah, yeah, love you too, and if it
weren't for this chip I'd show you how much. So what do you want to
do? I mean you're finally out of smallsville." Faith nodded. "He's got
a point B. We've finally got some decent clubs, and a realistic
nightlife." Buffy kept holding hands with Faith as she swung her head
back and forth between the two. "Need I remind you both that we are
here to work?" Spike shrugged. "Then let's go beat up some lawyers."
Faith gave him a smirk. "You mean Wolfram and Heart lawyers right?" He
shrugged again. "Whatever." Buffy shook her head. "Yeah, then they
give our descriptions to the police. I'm surprised they haven't
already." Faith shook her head. "Nah, Angel's got SOME pull with the
LAPD. Not much, but enough to keep us from getting false charges
trumped up." Buffy nodded. "But if we give them something real to
charge us with…"</p>

<p>While they had already left Caritas they had not even gotten a
full block away when the sounds of a fight reached their ears. The
slayers looked at each other and then at Spike. Buffy started to speak
to him, but Faith was already running back towards the club. "Spike,
something's wrong!" "So?" But Buffy had already taken off after her
partner, and with a grumble Spike followed. Buffy had only been a few
steps behind Faith and had caught up easily. When they surveyed the
scene they saw half a dozen men in long black coats and suits they all
had guns out, and had apparently used them because the bouncer at the
door was on the ground bleeding. Another had his gun trained on the
green skinned host and when they saw how that was keeping security at
bay they knew where to start. Faith dropped to a crouch and Buffy
reacted instantly. With a short hop she was landing on her partners
shoulders. A partner who stood up at the same time so Buffy had
practically doubled her momentum for the jump kick she delivered to
the man who was holding the host at gunpoint.</p>

<p>Her foot landed squarely between the man's shoulders and he
hit the ground face first at the feet of the host. Buffy had flinched
when she felt bone crunch but he was still breathing as he lay on the
ground. Though the fact he wasn't moving unsettled her. "Get em boys!"
As security was unleashed by the hosts words Buffy spun around. 3 of
them had been tackled to the ground by Spike who now seemed torn by
the pain in his head and the pain in his chest from two bullet wounds.
That still left Faith fighting two of them, and while the dark slayer
had managed to disarm one of them the second was aiming his pistol at
her. Reacting without thought Buffy caught a chair with her foot and
kicked it in the shooter's direction. While it only connected with his
legs it was enough to make the shot go wild and bury itself in the
ceiling. Faith didn't miss a beat as she drove both her fists into the
man's chest as he fell backwards, causing him to hit the ground with
enough force to bust the chair underneath him.</p>

<p>She then turned to face her second opponent, but one of the
bars security guards had tackled him to the ground and was taking
great pleasure in beating the man in the face and shoulders. Part of
Faith wanted to do something because the guard was a demon and the
other guy was not, but for the most part she didn't care. The larger
part won out and then she looked to see that the rest of the team was
currently suffering a similar fate at the hands of the Caritas
security staff. The host still was recovering as he walked up to the
slayers. "Man, lawyers, first they send someone around to kill you.
Next they'll probably sue me." Faith was confused as she looked at the
demon. "So what they were after you?" He shook his head. "Nah, they
were after you, but they seemed to think that the rules only applied
to the regulars and when I didn't tell them everything they wanted to
know they got violent." </p>

<p>Faith got angry at that. "And what did you tell them exactly?"
He held up his hands as Buffy turned to her girlfriend and laid a hand
on her chest. Buffy's actions seemed to soothe Faith more than
anything, but whatever the cause she settled down as he replied. "Just
that you were here. Same thing they could have gotten from anyone who
was here when you were." Buffy was turning back to him as the Host
continued. "However I'll give you a little free advice, of course you
know what they say about that, but you better be ready slayers.
They've sent in the goons. While they may have to sit in the big ol
building it doesn't mean they'll just sit around and wait for you to
come to them." The girls were nodding thoughtfully as Spike walked up,
his fingers dabbing at his bullet holes. "Very nice! Should have known
better then to try for a night on the town with a couple of slayers."
Neither turned to look at him as the girls spoke in unison. "You'll
heal." They both seemed to reach a conclusion as Buffy spoke up. "I'll
call the hotel. Faith, you and Spike bring the car around."</p>

<p>Faith nodded and walked up to the groaning blond vampire. She
scoffed at his pain and then put his arm over her shoulders in an
all-to abrupt motion. He shouted again and she just put her arm around
his waist and started pulling him out the door. "We need to get you a
new car Spike. Its one thing to be seen it in back in Sunnydale, but
in LA it's just embarrassing." He growled. "You're free to walk."
Whatever reply she may have made didn't make it back through the doors
as Buffy first made her way to a pay phone, but the Host shook his
head and motioned for her to use the one behind the bar. She gave the
demon a smile and did exactly that. It was picked up on the first ring
and when it was Angel's voice on the other end it made her wince. She
knew he was sitting in the dark brooding, and she was sure it was
about her. She still loved Angel, and she knew that part of her always
would, but whatever it was that made them first fall in love was gone.
At least for her it was. She knew Angel loved her as deeply and
passionately as she once loved him and it killed her as much as it did
him that she couldn't return it.</p>

<p>"Hello?" She realized she didn't respond right away. "Angel,
its Buffy." "Are you all right?" Some part of Buffy cursed him for
caring as much as he did. Her future was with Faith, but her past made
it all the harder by being as wonderful as he was. It was almost as if
she could let go, forget about Angelus, God help her even forget about
Faith and slip back into who she was when she was with him. However it
didn't fit, not anymore. It was like some old shirt pulled out of the
back of a drawer. It held scents, and feelings, and memories, but it
never fit like it once did. "I'm ok, we're all ok. Even Spike, but you
wouldn't know it by listening to him." "So something did happen?" She
looked out over the bar and saw the bouncers dragging off the Wolfram
and Heart thugs. She didn't let herself wonder what condition they
were in or what Caritas security would do with them. "Yeah, something
happened. Wolfram and Heart sent out some thugs to find us, and while
they didn't find us they got to Caritas just after we had left."</p>

<p>She took a breath at that point and Angel filled the space.
"Damn! I should have known they wouldn't sit still." Buffy shook her
head even though she knew Angel had no way to see it. "WE should have
known Angel." "Was anyone hurt?" She switched the phone to the other
ear as she replied. "Well the thugs were, and one of the bouncers was
shot. Spike was too, but I think he was more upset about getting
bullet holes in his jacket." "Do you need me to come get you?" Buffy
closed her eyes and forced down her sigh. "Nah, it's ok. Faith and
Spike are getting the car and we'll be back soon." "Ok, I'll see you
when you get here." She allowed the sigh after her reply and as she
put the phone back on the hook. "Bye." When she looked up the Host was
standing there. "It's tough, I know. Heck I feel for the big guy too,
but if he's ever going be human again he's gotta pay penance, and the
heart break is part of that." Buffy's face had gone pale and she had
stopped breathing. "Angel's going to be human again?'</p>

<p>The Host's eyes got wide. "And you didn't know that…awkward."
Her voice was shaky. "How?" He shook his head and his voice was
respectfully hushed. "Nobody knows how, or even when. There is just a
prophecy that talks of a vampire with a soul regaining his humanity,
and were not talking on merely a karmic scale. It's going to be pulse
and everything." "So what does he have to do?" The demon shrugged.
"There's no set finish line. Once he regains it on a karmic scale
he'll get it in the literal fashion." His eyes suddenly narrowed.
"What are you thinking?" Before Buffy could answer they heard Spike's
car pull up. Hearing that they both looked up and moments later Faith
entered and smiled at Buffy. "We'll have to ride up front. Spike
claimed the back seat so he could lie down because he's one of the
walking wounded. I told him he's already one of the walking dead, but
he didn't budge." When neither of them responded Faith muttered to
herself. "Well I thought it was funny." Buff had walked up to her
girlfriend. "It was." She mustered a weak smile. "It was hilarious."</p>

<p>Faith grinned and gave Buffy a kiss. "Thanks B. Nice of you to
say any way." The Host spoke up from the bar. "It was spectacular.
I'll see about getting a comedy night in here." The dark slayer gave
him a grin as the pair turned to walk out the door. As it closed he
spoke quietly. "I just hope you still have a sense of humor come
morning." As he heard the car pull away he wondered what was happening
inside. From the drivers seat Faith looked over at Buffy. "Something
wrong B?" Buffy was staring out the window, but she laughed at that.
"Wrong? Nope, not wrong." Faith looked confused, but she reached out
her hand and just touched Buffy's shoulder. The smaller slayer put her
hand on top of it and smiled. "You know you can tell me anything B."
Buffy shook her head. "Not this." Faith was about to argue, but she
saw Buffy cast her eyes in the direction of the back seat. From that
back seat they saw a match flare and a cigarette light. "Oh just tell
her already!"</p>

<p>Faith quickly stomped on the breaks and the car screeched to a
halt. From that back seat Spike cursed. "Damn it! Watch the driving!"
She shouted back over her shoulder. "Watch the mouth!" She then
lowered her voice as she looked over to Buffy. "Later?" Buffy nodded.
Faith then looked into her eyes. "Love you." Buffy's voice was still
weak, but she looked right back into Faith's eyes. "Love you too."
Both still looked shaken as they sat back into their own silences with
only the sounds of Spike's smoking and the laboring engine of his car.
It remained until they parked at the Hyperion. From the back Spike
started to sit back up. "So who's helping me get inside?" Buffy was
the one to answer. "Neither, the bullets went clear through. So you
should be fine by now." He seemed ready to argue, but then he got a
look at the slayer's eyes and nodded. All three got out of the car,
but while Spike went inside the two girls stayed with the car. Faith
stepped closer to Buffy. "So B, what's up?"</p>

<p>On the surface Faith appeared her normally cool, detached
self, but it was just a front and it no longer worked on Buffy. She
could see that Faith was worried, and she was scared. Buffy had been
feeling the same way, but seeing Faith like that seemed to quiet her
own fears. With out answering she pulled Faith into a tight hug, and
held the embrace so she could just rest in Faith's arms, which had
already gently wrapped around her. She felt Faith kiss the top of her
head and whisper. "I meant it when I said you could tell me anything."
Buffy lifted her head from Faith's should and smiled at her. "I know,
it was just a shock, and I had to digest it." Faith seemed comforted,
but Buffy could tell she was still weary. Buffy looked deeply into her
girlfriends brown eyes. "Do you trust me?" Faith responded
immediately. "With my life." Buffy smiled, but she also took Faith's
hands in her own. "Yes, but do you trust me with your heart?" Faith
paused and then slowly nodded.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled and then took a deep breath. "Then trust that I
love and that this has NOTHING to do with us. This will not affect us
in any way." Faith actually got a genuine grin at that. "That sounds
bad. You going to tell me you think we should see other people?" Buffy
sighed and shook her head. "No, but I'm going to say I could." Faith's
face twisted up in pure confusion as she waited for Buffy to continue.
"There is a prophecy that says Angel will become human again." Buffy
waited for Faith's response, and waited, and waited. "Faith?" Faith
shrugged. "Is that all?" Buffy seemed taken back. "What do you mean is
that all? My first love who I lost to a curse will have that curse
broken and be free to love again." Faith shrugged again. "We'll try to
find him a nice girl… B, when you and Angel were together you would
look at him and it was like the rest of the world was in black and
white. That's what drove me so damn crazy. I couldn't take being so
meaningless to  you. I wanted to the be the one you would look at that
way."</p>

<p>Buffy narrowed her eyes at Faith. "And now?" Faith grinned at
her. "And now I am." Buffy smiled and leaned against Faith, resting
her face to Faith's chest. "I love you." Was actually spoken into
Faith's chest as Buffy felt Faith run her fingers through her hair. "I
love you too. So you're probably going to want to talk to him right?"
Buffy lifted her head slightly and nodded. Then she rested her cheek
back to Faith's chest. "That's cool B. I'll just go get ready for bed
and wait for ya." They held hands as they walked to the doors. As they
got inside they saw Angel looked at them through his open office door.
They both gave him a look and then Faith leaned in and whispered in
Buffy's ear. "But if you take too long I'm grabbing my stake and
coming on down here." When Faith pulled back Buffy could see she was
grinning and Buffy grinned as well. A grin that was lost as she walked
into Angel's office. The vampire looked up at her. "Won't Faith be
joining us?" Buffy shook her head. "Nope, I'm the one who needed to
talk with you."</p>
