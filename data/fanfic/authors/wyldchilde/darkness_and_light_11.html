<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 11 -->

<p>The make shift emergency room actually seemed quite calm, and
in a way that was disturbing because it said Spike had set his mind on
something other then carnage when he had stormed the hospital. They
were able to find Giles by finding the police officer standing over
him. They all looked up but it was the officer who spoke first. "Buffy
Summers?" Buffy nodded with out thinking. He then turned to Faith.
"Faith Pryce?" They all looked a little shocked as she nodded. "Miss.
Pryce, you were listed as the resident of the home where the first
incident took place. Correct?" Faith nodded as the officer continued.
"Do you know Mr. Finn or his attacker?" Faith kind of glanced at Buffy
out of the corner of her eye and knew that they needed to give a
version that approximated the truth. "Buffy and Riley used to be
dating, and I've seen the guy in some of the bad parts of town."</p>

<p>He gave her an arched look, and Faith looked down at her feet.
"I didn't always run with the right crowd." The officer then turned to
Buffy. "You and Mister Finn had been in a relationship? May I ask the
cause of the break up?" This time Buffy met Faith's gaze. "I met
someone new." The officer looked at her to continue, and Buffy just
nodded towards Faith." The officer's eyes narrowed and he nodded. "So
your former boyfriend and an unknown male were seen outside the home
of your current girlfriend?" They froze as Buffy spoke. "Yes, but how
do you know this guy did it?" The officer seemed to pause. "I can't
say much about an on going investigation, but prints pulled from the
weapon that was used on Riley Finn seem to match ones we picked up in
the Emergency Room. I'll want all of you to look at some mug shots."</p>

<p>Giles then stood up. "Of course officer, but could it wait? We
have all been up all night, and through a terrible shock. I had
already given you the information to contact us. So is it something we
could possibly put off?" He nodded slowly. "Sure, just stop by the
station first thing tomorrow. Would you like a officer to escort you
home?" They shook their heads, and he then turned to Faith and Buffy.
"This added element is making us think it could be a combination of
crime of passion/hate crime." They both nodded as Buffy spoke. "The
other guy said you thought it was some right wing Aryan group?" He
nodded. "They have been moving in steadily from the coast. Look, we
don't have anything for sure, but the fact is this guy drove a wooden
stake into your ex-boyfriends chest, and if he is willing to do that
to someone he was supposedly working with then I pale to think what he
would do to two young ladies."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "Paling would definitely be involved." "If you
would be willing to stay in the same place I will have a unit keep an
eye on you." They all looked at him, and saw the determined set to his
jaw; Buffy sighed and then nodded. The rest looked a bit shocked but
hid it well as Faith spoke. "The mansion?" They all nodded. The
policeman then smiled. "All right once the doctors check you out we
will get you all home and then set up shifts to keep an eye on you."
Giles then spoke. "Is this standard procedure?" The cop shook his
head. "Anyone who would grab someone right out of a hospital is not
the kind of guy you want to let your guard down around." Buffy spoke
as they began following the officer. "You have no idea."</p>

<p>Xander was pacing. "Well normally it would be I go to the
mansion and THEN the hospital, but I still see a pattern."  Buffy
looked out the window and then looked back. "Ok, the cops are doing
fine. Now we need to focus on Riley." She then looked directly at
Xander. "What? I'm focusing on Riley. Focused right on Riley Finn." As
he spoke he held his hand up and moved it in a straight line from
between his eyes. She then looked between Faith and Xander. "You two
come to an understanding?" They both nodded as Xander spoke. "You
two?" Buffy bit her lip but Faith grinned rather slyly at Buffy. "Well
if you count Buffy knocking me to the ground and sticking her tongue
down my throat coming to an understanding?" The petite blonde blushed
deeply, and then sighed. "Not the way I would have said it, but yes,
Faith and I have come to an understanding. She then spoke under her
voice to Faith. "And I was not the one with the lip and tongue
action."</p>

<p>Faith shrugged. "My tongue down your throat, yours down mine.
It was the only thing I could do with you pinning me on the ground
about to have your way with me." Buffy scowled at the dark slayer, but
she did not object as the rest of the group blinked in stunned
surprise. Buffy then squared her shoulders. "Questions? Comments?
Criticisms?" When the group remained silent Faith smiled and spoke.
"Me and B. Who would of thought it?" Except for an uninterested Anya
all hands raised, though Xander's was last, as he seemed to be
distracted. "Oh, sorry. I was thinking about it now." Everyone shared
a light laugh as Buffy quirked an eyebrow. "Everybody sure? I mean
it's ME, and FAITH, and the love that dare not speak its name." Giles
shrugged. "The first slayer told us that slayers are supposed to be
alone, and while we will always be there for you Faith will give you
the companionship that will make sure that never happens."</p>

<p>Buffy seemed to consider that when Willow stage whispered.
"The "slayer thing." Buffy then grinned at Willow and Tara. "You mean
like "spell stuff"?" The Wiccans simply blushed. Anya then spoke out.
"Considering the effect it is already having on Xander I think it's a
good thing." Xander blushed deeply. "Anya!" Buffy looked closely at
Xander. "You sure?" Xander nodded. "She's the first of your hunnies
that actually took the time to talk to me first." They both kind of
blushed and Xander looked closely. "What?" Buffy shook her head.
"There was one kiss." Willow grinned. "One NAKED kiss." Buffy looked
offended. "I wasn't naked!" Xander's eyes got wide, but not displeased
as he stared at Faith. Anya hit him in the shoulder and he stopped.
Giles cleared his throat. "Well suffice it to say the details are
insignificant. We are all happy for you. Now I believe we should focus
on Riley Finn."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "Ok. Why did Spike take Riley?" Faith was the
first to speak. "Well he took him with instead of killing him on the
spot, and only took him when he had the chance to nab the rest of the
Scoobies." Xander held a hand up now. "Ah, ah Faith. As Buffy's new
sapphic sweetheart you are officially one of the Scoobies again."
Faith made a playfully horrified face as Buffy grinned. "Faith's
right, Spike was there for something uniquely Riley Finn." Xander
huffed on his nails and polished them on his shirt. "Well I would say
he might have wanted Riley's military skills, but those aren't
uniquely his." Buffy shook her head. "Generally, but he was also part
of the Initiative." Willow spoke up. "Maybe he wants to make sure the
chip gets out."</p>

<p>Giles seemed to consider that. "It is possible that if it was
turned off Spike fears it being turned back on." Buffy sat down. "Yes,
but Riley probably would have done that already." Giles was distracted
as he nodded. "Yes, but perhaps it's easier to deactivate it then
reactivate it. Either way Spike probably would rather be safe then
sorry." Willow nodded. "I can check the files we managed to get."
"Good, good. We also need to consider that Spike may be using him to
get to Buffy." Buffy took a breath. "Then he made a mistake. I will
rescue Riley from his own mistake because it's my job, but he's just
another potential victim as far as I'm concerned." Everyone looked
worried at Buffy's words and the light slayer sighed. "Look, when
Ethan worked with Trick did you worry about him getting bit? Riley
worked WITH Spike to kill someone. The fact that it's Faith doesn't
matter."</p>

<p>Faith looked slightly offended and Buffy paused. "I don't mean
it doesn't matter, but I mean that he worked with Spike to kill
someone is the main thing." Faith stood up and wrapped her arms around
Buffy's shoulders, as the rest of the Scoobies seemed to find the rest
of the mansion fascinating. "B, you cared for the guy, ya loved him,
and I think we both know those kind of feelings don't turn on and off
even when the person goes bad." Buffy tried to look away but Faith
reached out and gently turned Buffy chin back to face her. "I'm not
saying you should work yourself into a panic or anything because
that's just not a slayer's style." The two grinned at each other as
Faith continued. "But don't try to hide your feelings with rage."
Buffy frowned and placed her hand on Faith's abdomen where she had
stabbed her.</p>

<p>Faith shook her head while placing a hand on top of Buffy's.
"Don't, the Mayor had to have known the cure for the poison and he
knew that I couldn't kill you on my own. So he wanted me to do it in
self-defense by forcing you to try to kill me. Buffy, I fired the
poisoned arrow." Buffy started to shake her head, but Faith leaned in
and kissed her on the forehead. "My point is that no matter what Riley
did, it doesn't mean it changed your feelings towards him." Buffy
smiled shyly. "Nope, you did that." Faith blushed. "That's good,
because I still will kick his ass if he tries to make a move on you,
but that's just a matter of protecting my territory." Buffy grinned up
at Faith. "Does this mean you're the butch one?" Faith arched her
eyebrows. "Was there any doubt?" Buffy puffed up her frame, and then
grinned and rested her head on Faith's chest. "Ok, you can look now."</p>

<p>The rest turned their heads back as Giles spoke. "Faith does
make a good point. Spike may have realized that there could be
lingering feelings that he may try to exploit." Willow seemed to be
encouraging Tara to speak, and slowly the shy blonde did. "He may also
t…turn Riley." Buffy stepped forward, her face a serene mask of
determination. "Ok Willow we need you to check those files. Tara, I
want you to see if there is a spell that would help us find Riley.
Xander and Anya, while we know that Spike can't get into the mansion
since Faith is now living here I still don't want to leave them
unprotected. So I need you to keep an eye on them, and on the cops."
Xander spoke as he, Willow, Tara, and even Anya nodded. "Think they
might check up on us?" Buffy shrugged. "If they do just tell them that
the rest of us went to bed. I am more worried about Spike turning them
into in appetizers and then turning you guys into a main course. As it
is he might turn them in order to get a vamp inside. So be careful of
ANYONE who comes to the door. Also, if we are not back by the time
classes would start have Willow and Tara call the college and take
personal days, tell them I am taking one as well."</p>

<p>She then turned to Giles. "I know you would normally been on
research detail, but you've never been shy about swinging a stake, and
Faith and I could use the back up. So we take your car and try to find
Spike." Giles and Faith nodded as the group split to carry out its
tasks. Buffy then turned to Faith as they walked out towards the car.
"How's that for butch?" Faith laughed.  As they climbed into the car
they both noticed Giles seemed the perfect chauffeur as he stared
straight ahead and pointedly was NOT looking at anything his
passengers did. Buffy smiled. "It's ok Giles. I'm sure Faith and I
will be able to keep our hands off each other." Faith's voice was then
heard. "At least until we find Spike. I make no promises about after
we dust him." "Faaaaiiiiittttttthhhhhh." The dark slayers only answer
was a throaty chuckle.</p>

<p>While there was no laughing back in the mansion there was
grinning. Both Willow and Tara were grinning at the pacing Alexander
Harris as he checked the window for the 4th time in a half-hour.
"Something wrong Xander?" While her voice seemed distracted she was
grinning. "What? No, just worried. I mean with the super soldier in
enemy hands I think we should all be worried." Willow nodded, but kept
smirking. "And we are." Then in a rare show Tara spoke up as well. "We
just know that Buffy and Faith will be able to take him." Since
Xander's pacing had his back to the two of them Willow allowed herself
to grin at Tara. "Oh, we should get food. You know how they are after
slaying." Xander wiped around to look at the girls as Anya spoke up
with out lifting her head from a magazine. "Girls, don't tease Xander.
That's my job."</p>

<p>He scowled. "Shouldn't you two be working?" They both nodded
as Tara spoke. "A…Angel has a good assortment of spell books, but it's
almost all protection or exorcism spells." Willow peeked up from her
computer screen. "I think I'm having better luck. Spike's chip is also
a tracer so the Initiative could track him. " Xander nodded and sat
down next to Willow. "Good, good, does it have an on switch?" Willow
nodded. "It does, but the files describe a set up they would need to
carry inside a van." Xander winced. "Ok, ok, what about the tracer?"
"That's a smaller unit that each team leader was supposed to carry."
Xander and Willow looked at each other for a long moment until Xander
got up. "I'll beep Buffy and we'll get them to go get it from Riley's
place." Anya looked up. "Have them get a pizza too."</p>
