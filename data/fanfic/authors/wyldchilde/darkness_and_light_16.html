<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 16 -->

<p>They soon realized the weapons was actually a singular weapon,
but it seemed to be enough as it had driven them back to the door they
came in through and was pinning them down there. The firing stopped as
they slid several feet back into the tunnel, but everyone knew the
unseen gunman was just waiting for another target to show itself. They
all hugged the walls, but hunched over as if in a huddle. Buffy again
assumed the leadership role as she spoke. "Ok, we need to get to the
gunman." Xander then spoke up. "The area isn't that big. If someone
can distract the shooter I can nail him." Faith the spoke. "I'll do
it." Buffy immediately shook her head, but Faith reached out and
touched her bicep. "B, partners, remember, and it needs to be done."
Buffy seemed ready to argue. "Faith doesn't need to. I mean we already
have someone who's immune to gunfire."</p>

<p>Three sets of eyes latched on to the bleached blonde vampire.
"What? Oh no you don't! I'm not immune." Buffy was almost grinning at
Spike. "Close enough." Spike looked and saw three sets of eyes that
said he was running out there, or he was being pushed. He growled and
slid up closer to the entrance. "Make it quick. I have no desire to
increase my lead intake." Xander simply grinned. "Just try to take the
shots to the body so you'll still be able to walk." The vampire
growled over his shoulder as Xander readied his submachine gun and
slipped behind Spike. As they were counting down a rush of footfalls
was heard and demons rushed up to them. Xander looked torn, but
shouted. "He's trying to push us to the sniper." Buffy yelled back.
"Do it! Faith and I will hold them off." Of course the dark slayer was
already in the process of doing so as she slipped under the swing of a
hulkish green brute.</p>

<p>The creatures mammoth arms had ended up going high, but it
then attacked with insect like pincers, the set having one on each
side of his mouth. Faith managed to side step that, and was even able
to being her blade in an upward slash between the pincers. While the
wound was more messy then painful it distracted the creature long
enough for Buffy to step up and use her longer blade to remove the
creatures head.  Yet as the beast fell the girls realized that the
only reason he attacked alone was because the tunnel was so full his
massive size kept the others from moving forward. As the saw the
gathered throng Faith quickly handed Buffy one of the knives for her
otherwise free hand and took out two fresh ones for herself.</p>

<p>On the other end of the tunnel Spike had dashed out and
surprisingly managed to avoid the bullets seeking to cut him down.
Xander had already stood up and managed to locate the muzzle flashes
from their shooter. As the weapon fell silent Xander quickly strode
into the bay. With out a second thought he pulled a fragmentary
grenade from his web harness and hurled it at the sniper's position.
As the boom echoed Spike looked at him. "Isn't that a bit much?"
Xander was panting from exertion. "It worked didn't it?" "Xander?"
Buffy's voice echoed in the aftermath of the explosion. "Bay is
secure, fall back!" Spike seemed to be chuckling at him. "Careful, you
may have a soldier's mind, but you certainly don't have his body."
Xander looked offended at that, but didn't have time to reply as the
slayers ran into the bay. Again with out a second thought he tore
another grenade free, pulled the pin, and the let it sit a second to
avoid any nasty throwbacks and then hurled the grenade into the
tunnel. </p>

<p>The slayers already saw the grenade as he was preparing it and
got out of the way. They slipped back next to the other two and looked
into the hallway. Nothing stirred so they slipped forward and when
they looked into the hallway it looked like hell's own abattoir filled
with it's own monstrous inhabitants. From the elevator shaft they had
climbed down to mere feet from the entry was piled with bodies or
slick with blood. Now that the adrenaline from that fight had
seemingly wore off the humans seemed disgusted by the carnage, while
the vampire seemed amused. While most creatures were finished by bombs
or bullets or the skilled blades of the slayers there was an
occasional twitching which earned a quick mercy shot courtesy of
Xander's .45. Though it was more a matter of making sure they would
not return to haunt them then any sense of mercy towards the demons.</p>

<p>They returned to the bay and Buffy stepped in front of the
group. "Ok we need to find Giles and Tara, and we need to stop Riley."
While she saw the blonde vampire start to scoff she glared at him.
"You stole one life Spike, now you better try to make it up by saving
two."  He sneered at her, but his posture deflated and she knew she
had him. He then spoke. "Actually you might want to pair me off with
your sweet thing. She and I have no qualms about staking your ex, and
if you have Xander with he would be good if Riley tries to use any
soldier crap." Buffy looked suspicious, but seemed to think it was a
good plan as she nodded. Faith then lightly took her hand and pulled
Buffy into an embrace. The two shared a kiss that was soft, sweet and
promising, both promising to return and demanding that same promise.
Spike smirked. "Well now, isn't that just sweet, makes me wish I had a
Kodak camera."</p>

<p>Xander then spoke. "For once Spike I think we agree." Both
girls looked annoyed at they paired up with each of the guys and split
up. Spike and Faith going back into the one active hallway while
Xander and Buffy went down to the bay to explore the experimentation
chambers. As the light haired woman and the dark haired man entered
into the bay they both gawked at the area unlit by the lights that had
been restored to the rest of the uncovered complex. "Buffy?" "Yes
Xander?" "The lights are out right? I just haven't gone blind?" "There
out Xander." At that he turned on a small flashlight he had mounted
underneath his submachine gun. "Then why do I hear a generator?" "I
don't know Xander." With out another word the two began to walk
towards the steady mechanic hum.</p>

<p>"You know I can't blame you." Faith didn't even look over her
shoulder. "Not suprising, you're a demon, but I'm not. The things I
did were inexcusable." Spike laughed. "No, no, not your walk on the
dark side. I mean I can't blame you for going after Buffy. Trim,
athletic… flexible." Spike seemed to drift off. "Hey, bleach boy!
Focus!" Spike snapped back to attention. "Oh yeah, do you think blonde
is HER natural color?" Faith scowled at him as she continued to try to
focus her senses on the halls around them. "How would you know that?"
"Angel, or more Angelus really, wanker is such a blow hard he loved to
talk about how he shagged a slayer. Especially since it was what
allowed him to make his big come back." "Spike, your disgusting, and
considering that I'm the one to say that it means a lot." </p>

<p>Spikes voice then seemed to drift over her shoulder. "Yes, but
that means I'm not about to judge you, and if you think about it we
not that different you and I." She stopped at that and turned around
to face him. "You're a demon! I'm NOTHING like you!" He actually
seemed to get quiet at that, seemed to mental drift somewhere else.
"But you could have been, A few months ago if you had met up with
Angelus and he took a fancy to you. Don't get me wrong pet, I'm evil,
done things far worse then you ever have and enjoyed them, but I'm not
one of the world conquering dip shits and I don't want to drag the
world down into hell. It's far too interesting. I just know what I am
and revel in it." She looked at him. "So what the fuck are you
saying?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I had my black goddess, you found your white
one. Guess I just realize we have plenty in common." Faith looked
incredulous. "What? So you want to get together for a villain's night
out, or former villain's night out?" Spike shrugged. "Got something
better to do?" She actually grinned at that, somewhat astounded, but
she grinned. Before she was able to respond a third voice broke in.
"Sounds great, maybe we could start a bowling league." Both scattered
a far apart as the hallway allowed while Faith hurled her stake in the
direction of the voice. "Stake me once shame on you, stake me twice
shame on me." Riley Finn was in Initiative uniform complete with
assault rifle, but complimented by his vampiric ridges. Faith's hurled
stake was gripped tightly in his left hand while the rifle's grip was
held in his right. He pulped the stake in his grip, but the
distraction allowed Spike to dash across the distance and rip the
assault rifle from his grasp.</p>

<p>As Spike tore out the rifle's magazine and threw both as far
as he could away from Riley the younger vampire growled at him and he
smirked. "Now, now what kind of sire would I be if I let you play with
guns?" He drew his handgun and pointed it at Spike's head. "An
absentee one?" Before he was able to pull the trigger Faith drove her
palm to the ulna nerve, and even though dead it still made his drop
the gun. Spike grabbed him by the throat and slammed him back against
the wall. "Nope, none of that absentee sire, my own sire did enough of
that." Before Spike was able to complete the move Riley bought a knee
up and with his knee and his arms he was able to drive Spike backward.
Before he was able to get the other foot back to the ground Faith
grabbed it with one hand and used the other to sweep his foot out from
underneath him. Yet as he crashed to the floor his feet were able to
connect enough to drive Faith back. </p>

<p>He rolled away from the two of them and rolled to his feet.
"What? So we slaughter some Boy scouts on a sire/childe camping trip?"
Spike grinned. "I was thinking more of a "I brought you into this
underworld and I'll take you out." Riley growled and turned to run but
Spike knew where he had thrown the rifle and saw Riley was heading
towards it. So he scooped up the pistol and fired down that hallway to
drive Riley down one that he saw ran into a wall of concrete. As the
weapon clicked empty he and Faith began sprinting down the hallway.
The dark slayer never pausing, but drawing two stakes in midstride,
keeping one for herself and handing one to Spike. The two wiped around
the corner and the taller Spike was taken off his feet by a
clothesline from the well-muscled arm of Riley Finn.</p>

<p>Faith was able to duck under the swing and drove her stake
unerringly at the vampire's heart. Yet instead of feeling the sinking
into flesh followed by that resistance vanishing she felt the stake
hit something hard and the tip break off. The answering grin was
hideous. "Kevlar vest with titanium trauma plate. The thing is made to
shrug off bullets, bitch!" She reversed the stake and hit him hard
enough to rock him on his feet as she slipped past him. With a safe
distance between them she was able to pull one of her knives. Faith
had been trying to distract Riley from Spike and the tactic was
successful as the prone vampire drove one of his booted feet up and
into the undead soldier's groin. While the crunching sound said that
Riley had remembered to wear his cup it didn't stand up under the
crushing force his sire was able to apply.</p>

<p>Spike grinned from the floor, as Riley seemed to fold in on
himself. "Guess there not titanium are they?" While Spike got up
gloating, Faith didn't waste a second. She guessed that the armor
focused on protecting the front and back and would then have its
straps on the side. So that's where she struck. Stabbing her bade in
by his hip she jerked it up and encountered more resistance than flesh
could provide. That was sufficient encouragement to drag the blade up
with all the force she could muster. Then it got near the top and
Riley was able to twist free, though he still seemed to be favoring
his injured privates. Spike then dashed in behind him and yanked the
armor plate back. There was a ripping sound and Riley's chest seemed
to become misshapen. Faith saw Spike's discarded stake and dove for
it.</p>

<p>Riley brought his foot up to stop on her, but Spike saw it
coming as punched his childe across the jaw. Riley snapped back his
elbow and caught his sire square between the eyes, which rocked the
older vampire and sent his careening back dazed. It still provided
Faith the opening she needed as she rolled to one knee and used the
forward motion to drive the stake inward and upward. She instantly
recognized when the stake hit heart tissue, but even if she didn't the
blatant look of disbelief on Riley Finn's face would have. A look that
seemed to remain as his body crumbled to dust. As Spike regained his
senses he grinned. "We're not half bad as a team. What do ya say?
Looking for your own brooding vampiric beau?" His answer was another
hard blow between the eyes as Faith slugged him.</p>

<p>"You're lucky it's just me Spike. Buffy would have staked you,
chip or no chip." He got up grumbling. "What? So you're already
Buffy-whipped?" Faith smiled. "Mind, body and soul." Spike shrugged.
"So is she the tiger in the sack Angel said she was?" He ducked as he
saw her about to hit him again. "I wouldn't know." He looked shocked.
"What you've already pledged your body to her and you haven't even
given her a test run? I'm disappointed." Faith shrugged. "Guess we're
not as alike as you thought. Now lets look for Giles are Tara."</p>
