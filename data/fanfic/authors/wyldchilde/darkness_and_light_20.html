<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 20 -->

<p>Joyce Summers sat down heavily and looked at the two girls,
one was her baby, her little girl with the big destiny. The other
shared that destiny, and her little girl. She could see the pain on
her daughter's face as she was torn between two of the most important
people in her life, and it hurt her to see it. It was when she was
looking closer she saw the mark on Faith's neck. First she had thought
it simply a bruise, and while she didn't like seeing anyone hurt it
was something she had forced herself to become used to with her
daughter, but now she saw it was not a bruise it was a hickey. With
what she had just been told she had a good idea of where she got it.</p>

<p>"Mom, say something." "What can I say? I mean you have already
made up your mind." Buffy looked hurt. "Mom, I didn't want to hide
this. I want your support. I'm mean this is confusing enough as it is.
I need Faith in my life, but I need you too." "Oh Buffy. I'm your mom,
and I am not going to make the same mistake that I made when I learned
about you being the slayer. It's just confusing for me too." Buffy
nodded nervously, and Joyce felt the need to continue. "However I know
Faith's a good girl, and I know you are too, and I guess two slayers
are better then one. I just hope you are ready." Buffy took Faith's
hand and smiled at her. "We are." Faith smiled shyly as Buffy, and
even more so at Joyce. Joyce was smiling as well, if a bit
reluctantly.</p>

<p>The three of them stood back up and walked into the living
room where everyone looked at them nervously. Joyce shook her head.
"There's no yelling, and no one is storming out. Let's just leave it
at that. I suppose I should go." Buffy let go of Faith's hand and took
hold of her mom by the elbow. "Do you have to? I mean I'm serious when
I say I mean I want to do the mother/daughter, daughter's girlfriend
bonding." She seemed surprised but she nodded at her daughter. "Ok,
what are we doing? "Xander was the one to answer. "Well we just
finished some Star Trek and we were deciding what to watch next."
Joyce Summers sat down rather primly and then noticed how close Willow
and Tara were sitting. "You too?" The girls blushed and looked at each
other. The action caused Joyce to sigh. "Couldn't you have just all
gotten tattoos?"</p>

<p>All four girls looked hurt and Joyce sighed yet again. "No, no
I'm sorry. I just need to digest all of this." Giles stood up from the
computer and walked over to the small group. "Joyce, I know it is a
lot. I will just say that after all Buffy has done for the world it
would be inexcusable to deny her some happiness, and Faith makes her
happy." At Giles words they all looked over at the slayers and the two
girls looked uncomfortable, which caused them to move closer together
in an unconscious needing, and giving of support. Joyce noticed that,
as did everyone, but it was a revelation to her and her expression had
softened. "All I have ever wanted was for Buffy to be happy, and if
that is with Faith then… I WANT to support that. I will support that."</p>

<p>With tears in her eyes Buffy hugged her mother tightly, and
her mother returned it. "I just worry, you went from my little baby to
the chosen one, and I guess I have had trouble catching up." Buffy
pulled back to look at up. "I haven't been much help there. I mean
first I hid the slaying, and even when you found out I never really
talked to you about it." Joyce did not nod, but Buffy could tell her
mother agreed, but before the guilt was able to settle in her mom
spoke. "We've both made mistakes, and we're both sorry." They both
nodded as the group gave them space. "Now it's a matter of where we go
from here." "You're right, and there is more. For Faith and me it is
not that we are both girls, but that we are both slayers." The
expression on her mothers face grew questioning as she took a breath
to speak and Giles stepped close.</p>

<p>"Now as you know there had only been one slayer." Joyce nodded
and her expression was pained. "Another had not been called until
Buffy died." Giles nodded empathetically. "Then another slayer was
called, Kendra." Suddenly Willow's voice interrupted. "Wait, why
didn't Buffy and Kendra… you know?" Giles cleaned his glasses. "Kendra
had received proper training, and part of that training included the
ability to control her impulses." Both the girls rolled their eyes at
the Watcher as he continued. "Still, if Kendra had been more open with
her emotions she and Buffy could have formed the connection " Joyce
held up her hands "Wait, so you are telling me that the slayers are
some how destined to fall in love?" Giles shook his head.</p>

<p>"We heave learned that there was one slayer, and her power was
passed down from generation to generation, and when each died that
power passed to the next slayer. We believe that when Buffy "died…"
Joyce flinched again at the mention of her daughter's death.  "When
that happened the slayer power started to pass on, but she was brought
back before that could completely happen and the slayer power was
fractured. Some went into Faith, while some had stayed with Buffy. Now
not only does the gift of the slayer include powers like superhuman
strength, agility, healing, but it also included instinctual behaviors
like being able to recognize the undead on sight. Now when the slayer
gift shattered it included the instinctive knowledge that it was
incomplete."</p>

<p>Joyce looked horrified. "So it's controlling them?" Again
Giles shook his head. "No more then our own instinctive behaviors,
because the fact is that the two slayers quite literally share a
spirit. Literally soul mates." She seemed a bit more comfortable.
"Still, what about their own choices? I mean they can not be
controlled simply by instinct." The watcher sat down. "And they're
not. Like I had said with Kendra not being suitable personally it took
someone that Buffy could be compatible with. To give an example, Buffy
fights vampires because she wants to protect humanity, but her slayer
instincts give her additional incentive. That is the same thing with
the relationship with Buffy and Faith. The instinctual pull simply
allows them to consider someone of the same gender romantically."</p>

<p>Buffy had noticed Faith squirmed at Giles words, and when she
looked at her, which was soon followed by the rest of them looking at
her. "Umm… I've never been too picky. I mean if I was attracted to
someone I was attracted. I never worried over something like gender."
While Joyce looked uncomfortable the rest seemed to shrug it off as
Giles began again. "That simply means that in Faith's case the pull
just led her to consider Buffy, and in Buffy's case it opened her mind
to the possibility of Faith. If they had truly not wanted to be
together then they would have been able to ignore the pull. While it
would have been uncomfortable to do so being the slayer gifts a
tremendous amount of willpower and they are both willful in the first
place."</p>

<p>The girls rolled their eyes at the Watcher's comments, but
calmed down when Joyce looked at them. "So what your saying is that
they are meant to be together?" The English accent carried the
response. "Not as much MEANT to be together as well suited to be
together. While they could find happiness elsewhere I truly feel it
would not compare to what they could find together." The two girls in
question were surprised at the praise and Joyce seemed to be so as
well. "Well, who am I to argue with destiny?" She then looked at
Willow and Tara. "What about the two of you?" They both blushed and
Willow answered her. "Just a good ol fashioned "Love that dare not
speak it's name" kind of thing." Joyce Summers seemed to smile sadly.
"Oddly that I have an easier time of accepting. I always have
supported gay rights. I guess that my convictions aren't as strong
when it's my own flesh and blood."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "No mom, you just never had to deal with
it up close before, but thank you for dealing with it." Joyce shook
her head, but she smiled. "I won't say I've dealt with it entirely,
but I will. I love you Buffy, and Faith, I am willing to trust my
daughter to you." Faith's eyes got wide as she nodded silently. "I
have a feeling there is more. Maybe we should just get it all out. I
mean we have been here over four years and I barely know anything."
They all started nodding and Giles made himself comfortable. Faith got
up. "I'll go grab us some more munchies." Buffy got up. "You not
worried about…" She gave her mother a glance and Faith smiled. "No,
Mrs. S knows about my past and any details Giles gives her will just
be things she deserves to know. She's forgiven me." Joyce gave her a
smile and Faith returned it. Buffy stayed on her feet. "I'll help you
out."</p>

<p>The two girls walked into the kitchen and Buffy stepped up to
the counter. She felt Faith step up behind her and put her arms around
Buffy and hold her now trembling hands. As Faith kissed her neck she
let out a long, shuddering breath. "I didn't think things would go so
well." She could feel Faith smile against her neck. "You shouldn't be
surprised, your mom is a together lady." Buffy snuggled back into
Faith's arms. "Yeah and I have pushed that to the limit with keeping
her in the dark." Faith shook her head and placed another kiss on her
neck. "Yeah and your mom stuck her head in the sand. Again, your mom's
not blaming you. So you shouldn't either." She turned around in
Faith's arms and put her cheek to Faith's chest. "I love you." "I love
you too." "…So, I'm not your first girl?"</p>

<p>She looked up and Faith was blushing. "Nah, but you're my one
and only. You know that don't you?" Buffy smiled. "I know. I just
didn't realize you were so adventurous." An eyebrow arched high on
Faith's head. "You didn't?" That caused Buffy to blush and burrow her
face in Faith's cleavage for a second. "I probably was just a little
bit in denial." Faith kissed the top of Buffy's head. "Didn't want to
think of ol Faith as kissable huh?" Buffy looked back up and grinned
at her. "Looks like it was a good idea, because now I can't think of
much else." They both laughed at that and shared a kiss, then Faith
sighed into Buffy's mouth. "We better get back out there or Xander
will come creeping in hoping for some eye candy." Buffy arched an
eyebrow back at her girlfriend. "You've never seemed shy before."</p>

<p>Faith smiled. "I'm not, but some kisses are fun, and free, and
I don't give a damn who seems them, but sometimes the kisses are just
for you and me." Buffy nodded and pressed herself into the hug. "Have
I told you I love you lately?" Faith smiled. "About 5 minutes ago."
Buffy kissed her. "How do you ever put up with me being so
neglectful." Faith smirked and placed her hands on Buffy's bottom and
gave it a squeeze. "That firm little behind. I'll just follow it
anywhere." Buffy giggled. "Now you better follow it out to the living
room." The two gathered up all the foods they had gotten and walked
back into the living room. Buffy smiled at her mom and spoke to the
group. "Ok, what are we talking about?" Xander smiled widely at Buffy.
"We were discussing how one would have safe sex with a vampire."
Buffy's eyes got wide and Faith grinned as she sat down and pulled
Buffy into her lap.</p>

<p>"Now B are you telling me you didn't use any protection? No
crosses or holy water, nothing?" Buffy gave her partner an aggravated
glance, which earned her a grin from Faith and even a slight smile
from her mother. "It's ok Buffy. I know you're sexually active." She
then gave a pointed look to the hickey on Faith's neck and both
slayers blushed. "I just didn't realize you had started as young as
you had. Of course now a days I guess that's not TOO young." Buffy
nodded. "So is that where we are? At Angel's curse being broken?" The
rest of the group nodded, and Buffy spoke sadly. "Then the safest sex
would have been abstinence, or at least reading the wording of Angel's
curse." In a similarly sad tone she related the details of Angel's
fall, and being sent to hell.</p>

<p>Wordlessly her mother stood up, walked over to her daughter
and embraced her as she related the details of the duel that sent the
soul of Angel to hell, for the first time in their entirety. "Oh
sweetheart. If I had only known. I know you were trying to protect me,
but please, PLEASE never try to carry something like that by yourself
again." Buffy nodded against her mother's shoulder. Slowly she
released her daughter and eased her back into the arms of her
daughter's girlfriend. As Buffy settled back in Faith's arms she
seemed to slump, her considerable endurance being taxed by the emotion
of the time. So far Faith had been detached from the events, but as
she heard them start to detail that first magical moment she met Buffy
she startled to slump back herself.</p>

<p>Buffy noticed this and took hold of Faith's hands and held
them in front of her. The gesture was not lost on her mother. That and
the way that the description of her acts seemed physically painful to
Faith seemed to keep Joyce from being too shocked. When it reached the
point where her daughter shoved Faith's own knife into her own stomach
she was shocked as she stared at both of the girls. Buffy cringed
under the look and Faith squeezed her tight while kissing her temple.
The entire room seemed amazed at their actions; the girls actually
seemed to be trying to soothe each other's guilt from the dark deeds
they had committed upon each other. By the time they reached Riley and
the Initiative both girls had gone numb, and just answered questions
asked of them.</p>

<p>When the tale had been told Buffy lifter her weary eyes to her
mother. "That's it, that's my life since Sunnydale." Her mother got up
from her chair and planted a kiss on her daughter's forehead. "I knew
what you did, but I never knew what it took. I'm very, VERY proud of
you." Both Summers women seemed on the verge of tears as they embraced
again. "I love you mom." I love you too Buffy." When they broke a red
eyed mother looked at Faith. "I think we could all use some rest. Do
you have room for one more?" They all smiled at that. "You know it
Mrs. S. Namely we just pick one of the many bedrooms, drag off the
dust covers and put on some linens. I'll show you where they are."
Giles stood up.</p>

<p>"No need. I'm sure you young people could use we grow ups out
of the way." The way that Giles delivered his speech with an entirely
straight face caused everyone to grin. That included Joyce Summers as
she followed her candy-induced fling back into the dark recesses of
the house. "Giles, do you really feel that way about the two of them?"
He looked at her. "Buffy and Faith? Yes. While I have wishes for the
both of them, underneath it all I want them both to be happy, and the
simple truth is that together they are, and happiness can be all too
fleeting for me to attempt to tamper with it." "So you don't think
they'll last?"</p>

<p>Giles smiled. "I didn't say that. All I mean is that the love
they share is hard to find, and I could not attempt to destroy it and
still claim to have their best interests at heart. What about you?"
Joyce sighed. "I'm getting to know my daughter all over again, and
this time I'm not going to judge anything." Giles smiled warmly at
her. "That's good, because now you are on the inside and there is no
going back." Joyce shook her head. "She's my daughter, and I have no
intention of going back." "That's good, because there is quite the
adventure ahead."</p>
