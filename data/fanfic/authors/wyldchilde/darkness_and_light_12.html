<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 12 -->

<p>For the first fifteen minutes the slayers had been keep busy
by a cutthroat game of footsie. That was followed by perhaps 20
minutes of tickling, but now the playfulness had worn off and the both
were bored. They started to stare rather sullenly ahead when they both
noticed the quizzical look Giles was giving them. Buffy closed her
eyes and then opened them. "Giles…" His head snapped back ahead. "Yes
Buffy?" She slid forward on her seat. "Ok, so you noticed Faith and I
are acting strangely." He shook his head. "Your young and in love, no
further explanation is needed." "I wish it were so." Giles looked more
interested at the worried look on Buffy's face and how Faith slid
forward so there legs were touching and she could put her arm around
Buffy's waist.</p>

<p>"With Faith and me, it feels like… we're in heat." Faith
arched a brow as Giles blushed. "No, not like that. I mean like
literally in heat. I mean I was sniffing Faith." Giles seemed very
uncomfortable and took a moment before he spoke. "So you two are
"mating"?" Buffy blushed. "Well we haven't yet, but kinda, ya." Giles
considered silently. "I have to believe it has something to do with
our calling upon the spirit of the first slayer, and by extension
Faith." Giles didn't notice it, but Faith looked away slightly, but
Buffy did notice and looked concerned. Faith seemed unresponsive so
she settled for resting Faith's head to her shoulder, which seemed to
help. "Faith's entirely unique status probably play a part as well."
At those words Faith's head rose as they both listened to Giles as he
continued.</p>

<p>"There has only been one slayer, until now. We had assumed
that Faith simply possessed the slayer's gifts, but now that we know
there was a single slayer that has been passing her power from
generation to generation and slayer to slayer. So when a second slayer
was activated it is possible Buffy's gifts were split." Faith looked
concerned but Buffy silenced her with a hand on the knee, as Giles
seemed to get on a roll. "The attraction that the two of you
experience may also be tied to that. The two of you may literally be
different sides of the same coin. Yin and Yang, alpha and omega, light
and dark." The two looked at each other and smiled shyly. Do you think
that's it?" They both blushed as Faith then spoke. "Best idea so far,
but what about the jungle fever part of it?" Giles seemed ready to
stammer. "Buffy channeled the spirit of the first slayer and it would
seem that had unlocked some of the more primal instincts of the
slayer."</p>

<p>Buffy looked wide-eyed. "What can we do? I mean I don't want
to be collared and led around on a leash." Faith exaggerated a leer at
Buffy. "You sure bout that B?" Buffy smiled and rolled her eyes as
Giles took a breath. "Yes, well. I will start researching the previous
slayers and put the both of you on a strict training regimen. Both for
your physical abilities as well as your mental discipline." The two
seemed to pout at that, but nodded reluctantly. Buffy suddenly jumped
a bit and the others looked at her. "Sorry, pager started vibrating."
Faith smirked and Buffy rolled her eyes again. "Can you go five
minutes with out thinking about sex?" Faith looked like she was
seriously considering the question. "I'll need a stop watch, and you
in the other room."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled and shook her head. "It's Xander, we're supposed
to call him at the mansion." Giles nodded and began looking around,
finding a payphone to pull up to a moment later. He was actually close
enough that Faith was able to lean out and do the dialing before she
handed the phone to Buffy. At Buffy's curious look she smiled. "You're
the leader type, I'm just your woman." Before it picked up however
Buffy quickly put the phone back in Faith's hand. "Hello?" Xander's
voice was distinct over the phone as Faith put it to her ear. "You
rang?" "Faith, all right. Willow managed to find out the chip in
Spike's head is also a tracer. Team leaders were supposed to have the
tracker units, and were thinking Riley probably used that to track
down Spike." Faith considered that for a second. "But he didn't seem
to have anything like that with him at the mansion." </p>

<p>"Yeah, it's about the size of two game boys glued together end
to end. So he probably used it to get Spike's location, and then came
to find him personally. Still, best bet's his dorm room." Faith nodded
as Buffy and Giles looked on. "Any word on finding Spike's on switch?"
"Nope, at least nothing we can use. The portable version of the on
switch fit inside a van." Faith chewed her lip. "Ok, we'll just have
to deal with Spike the old fashioned way. Thanks, we'll stop by
afterwards either way." Xander didn't reply for several seconds, and
then when he came back he was mumbling. "Yeah, and if you could grab a
pizza on your way back." Faith laughed, and then she looked directly
at Buffy. "Yeah I know how I can get after slaying. Thank the rest of
the guys too if ya would." Faith then hung up. "Ok, Spike's chip does
allow him to be tracked but it requires a thingy about two and a half
to three feet long. They think Riley has it in his dorm room."</p>

<p>Giles nodded. "It's our first lead." He then turned the car to
head back towards the college. Buffy snuggled close to Faith. "Was
there anything else?" Faith shook her head. "Nope, I think that about
covers it." "What about how you get after slaying?" Faith appraised
Buffy rather directly. "You already know how I get after slaying."
Buffy squirmed for several seconds and then Faith grinned. "Oh, and
we're supposed to pick up pizza." Buffy took a breath and then sat
back in her seat. "Oh, a pizza, ok." Faith smiled and leaned back with
her, resting Buffy's head to her shoulder. As any of it's residents
could tell you, Sunnydale is a small town, and by the time they were
to the point of cuddling in the back seat they could recognize the
sights that lead up to the college. </p>

<p>When they saw Riley's dorm they recognized the signs of a
vampire attack. It reminded Buffy of Spike's first appearance in
Sunnydale when he attacked the parent/teacher conferences. Except it
did not seem as wide spread, like there were fewer vampires who tried
to make up for the fact with greater carnage. Again the police had
arrived there before them, but this time it was well before and the
police had been there for the attack. The girls realized this as they
passed a police car with one officer who had went through the
windshield. It could have been a crash if it weren't for the fact that
all of the broken glass was on the inside of the car. The slayers had
stepped from the car with their Watcher right behind them. "Do you
sense anything?"</p>

<p>The slayers seemed to shake their heads in unison, as Buffy
was about to speak for them. The radio is the police cruiser beat her
to it however as the frantic voice of the dispatcher was heard over
the radio. "Unit 12! Unit 12 Do you read?" The slayers looked at each
other as the announcer continued. "Calling all units, calling all
units. Officers Down, 2 suspects both described as athletic white
males, one is wearing a black leather long coat and is a bleached
blonde.  The other has been identified as Riley Finn." They all looked
at each other, but Giles was the first to speak. "I believe anything
of use to us will have already been taken.  It would be best if we
went back to the mansion." The slayers looked reluctant to leave, but
they knew that they had arrived too late. Faith accurately stated
their feelings as they got back into the car. "I'm getting sick and
tired of playing catch up with Willie!"</p>

<p>When they entered Xander was ready to speak but Anya beat him
to it. "Didn't have time to stop for pizza huh?" They all stared for a
second as Buffy spoke. "No." Xander shook his head. "The cops tore out
of here with something about an officer down call. Said they would
send someone to watch over us as soon as they can, but until that
point we should lock all the doors and windows and not let anyone in,
and at this point I have to agree." Buffy nodded and then took a
calming pause. "That will include Riley." The group that had been
gathered in the living room gaped at her while Faith and Giles looked
downward. "We haven't seen him, but it looks like Spike has turned
him. So if he shows up get me or Faith and do NOT invite him in."
Xander looked closer. "The officer down call?" "Riley's dorm, at least
one cop and probably plenty more people. We got there too late. Still
it's late, were all tired. Since the cops didn't notice we were gone
lets get some sleep and start fresh."</p>

<p>Xander looked around. "Ok, sleeping arrangements?" Most
everyone either shuffled their feet, smirked, or both as Faith grinned
while she spoke. "Well, there are plenty of bedrooms to choose from.
So I think we'll let everyone pick and just meet back here once we
wake up?" They all nodded and shuffled off Xander with Anya, Willow
with Tara, and Giles seeming to see where they went and then heading
the opposite direction. Faith slipped next to Buffy, actually seeming
shy as she spoke. "Should we head to bed?" Buffy was shy as well.
"Okay." Faith took Buffy's hand and led her towards the master bedroom
that she had taken up residence in. As they both entered the room they
kicked off their shoes while looking around and seeing the covers were
still turned back from when Faith had went to investigate outside the
house. It seemed an eternity ago, but was a simple matter of hours.
They both stared at each other until Buffy spoke. "Well you may be
ready for bed, but I seem to have forgotten my pjs."</p>

<p>Faith tried to look shy, but seemed unable to hide a grin.
"That's a problem. Isn't it?" Buffy smiled back at her. "Not really."
Faith looked into her eyes, and arched a brow. "Really?" "Well, you
seemed to think I should take after you, sleepwear seems a good
start." The both smiled and Faith's hands moved to the waistband of
her jeans, and then dropped back down. Buffy smirked. "Faith? Are you
shy?" Faith seemed to take that as a challenge and dropped her hands
to the buttons of her jeans. She then looked Buffy right in the eyes
as she unfastened them. Looking Buffy in the eyes she could see the
other slayers eyes had darkened with desire.</p>

<p>So Faith decided to make a show of it. Unbuttoning her jeans,
and then unzipping them, pulling the dark fabric wide to show the
rather plain white panties underneath. She supposed she was just lucky
the big guy braved the women's department at all, and of course he
would have had no way of knowing that she would wind up stripping for
his ex-girlfriend. She looked up and saw Buffy was unable to look away
as Faith slid the jeans down over firm, rounded hips and further to
pool at her ankles. When she stepped free she leaned over to pick them
up, fold them and set them aside. Having stood up she reached to her
collar and grabbed her shirt and pulled it up. "You going to get ready
for bed? Or do you need my help?" </p>

<p>Buffy shivered at Faith's suggestion, but she started
unfastening her own pants. Faith quickly pulled her shirt over her
head so she would not miss watching Buffy get undressed and Buffy
seemed to realize it. While she seemed shy, Faith could see the flush
coming to Buffy's skin and knew the petite blonde was enjoying getting
undressed in front of her. Buffy actually seemed to stop breathing as
Faith unfastened her bra. That caused Faith to smile wickedly as she
pulled it away. "Come on now B. It's not like you haven't seen them
before." Buffy had stripped down to her undergarments as she stepped
up close to Faith, voice almost a whisper. "Yes, and they are just as
beautiful as before." Buffy asked the question with her eyes, and
Faith answered the same way as Buffy lifted her hand up and cupped one
of Faith's breasts.</p>

<p>A moan escaped both of them as Buffy took her fingertips to
the tightening nipple. Faith bit her lip as she watched Buffy's
fingers first gently pinched the tip, and then rolled it between her
fingers. Her arms wrapped around Buffy where her hands quickly removed
the rest of Buffy's clothes. The contact never broke as Buffy stepped
free of her panties, but when Faith pulled the brassier free Buffy's
hand left her chest and moved to her waist to remove Faith's panties
as well. Now standing naked in front of each other the two slipped
onto the bed, over the covers, and met in a kiss. As their lips
pressed together their bodies did as well and both seemed ready to
swoon. While they had pressed together it was so much more intense
when they were both naked.</p>

<p>Buffy looked deeply into Faith's eyes and her expression
saddened. "Buffy?" Buffy tried to look away from the worry on Faith's
face, but Faith caught her cheek and turned her back to look at her,
and seemed relieved when she leaned into the touch. "Buffy? What's
wrong? You know we don't have to." Buffy's quickly shook her head.
"No, it's not that. I want to. It's just when I looked at you I
suddenly saw you with vampire ridges." Her hand dropped from Buffy's
face and joined the hands together. Faith lifted the hands to her face
and guided them along her brow, and her cheeks and chin until they
came to rest on her neck where she placed one hand's fingers on the
rapidly pounding pulse point. The smaller slayer seemed on the verge
of tears and she leaned in and kissed that pulse point. "But for how
long Faith? First Angel, now Riley…"</p>

<p>Faith's fingers ran through blonde locks as she gently guided
Buffy's eyes to meet her own. "We don't know that Riley has been
turned, for all we know Spike just managed to hook back up with
Drucilla, and I don't understand what Angel would have to do with it.
I mean he was turned centuries before you were ever born." Buffy shook
her head slightly in Faith's hands. "Yes but a vampire stole his soul,
and has probably stolen Riley's, and it's my job to fight them, and
that makes them a part of my world. Which puts everyone I love in
danger." She kissed Buffy's lips with exquisite tenderness. "First of
all everyone who loves you realizes the danger and accepts it. Second
of all me, Riley and Angel all would have been in the vampire biz even
if we never met you. Thirdly, It's my job too. I'm just as much a
slayer as you are." </p>

<p>The smile on Faith's face found it's way on to Buffy's as
Faith continued. "I have no intention of being just a lover Buffy. I
still want to be your partner, now I just want it to be in life as
much as in slaying."  The eyes that had always managed to captivate
her looked right into her soul as she was blown away by two simple
words. "You are." Two words that meant as much to her as "I do" and as
she looked at Buffy she knew they meant as much to her as well. Faith
leaned in and kissed Buffy again and gently eased her to lie down.
"Let's get some sleep."  Buffy nodded as she snuggled up next to Faith
and rested her cheek to the brunette's chest and wrapped her arms
around Faith's waist while resting her hands as the small of the dark
slayer's back. "I do love you." Faith smiled softly as she wrapped her
arms around the smaller woman's shoulders. "I love you to."</p>
