<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 19 -->

<p>Upon awakening Buffy could feel fresh, cool air over her back,
and warm flesh under her chest. She didn't even bother opening her
eyes as she nuzzled closer to the abundant chest she was resting
against. As she did so she let out a contented purr. Then she started
kissing her was up from between Faith's beautiful breasts  and to her
collarbone. The taste of Faith's sweat and their combined passion made
her swoon, and as she stretched out her muscles felt comfortably used
made her smile. It was almost enough to distract her as she bit
Faith's neck and started to suck. Not feeding like their unliving
foes, not even breaking the skin but instead just bringing the blood
to just under the surface, leaving her mark on her mate. That woke
Faith  and her hands started to scratch over Buffy's skin, both of
them purring in unison. Buffy's lips then moved up to Faith's and they
shared another long kiss, lingering traces of their passion there as
well.</p>

<p>It was then Buffy realized that she didn't feel any bed
sheets, namely because they had made love right then and there in the
living room. The strange thing was that the experience was not
cheapened by the fact, but enhanced because it meant they were unable
to contain their passion a second longer. After that realization sunk
in she realized that while they were alone now it was not going to
last, and that caused her to sit up abruptly. "Faith! We have to get
dressed!" The brunette looked like she missed the contact of the
smaller blonde body and reached her hands up to Buffy's hips to
maintain it. "Why?" "They'll be back soon. They should be back
already!" Faith shrugged, but since she was on her back it was more a
roll of her shoulders. "So? Were all adults." She then grinned rather
wickedly. "Besides Willow and Tara had sex here." Buffy looked
aggravated. 'Yes, but not in the living room, and they didn't lay
there naked, waiting for someone to walk in on them."</p>

<p>Faith grinned. "No that sounds more the style of Xander and
Anya." Buffy reached down and grabbed Faith's shoulders and sat her
up. "We'll talk about it later. Now get dressed." Buffy hopped off of
her and started looking for her clothes, which was hindered by the
fact the girls had flung them off with out too much thought about
where they would land. Faith got up as well, but she sighed as she did
so, and she too began gathering her clothes. Though by the time Buffy
had gotten dressed Faith was still effectively stripped to the waist.
She then turned and put her hands on her hips. "So B. What the hell
did you do with my top?" They both looked and then Buffy looked by the
open door to the entryway and saw that it had landed just inside. She
ran up and took it in hand, and as she heard the front door open she
tossed it back into the living room.</p>

<p>A jovial Xander was the first to enter with one hand balancing
several pizza boxes. Right behind him his girlfriend Anya had two full
grocery bags, and behind her Giles was carrying several cases of pop.
"Wow, you guys went all out." Xander grinned. "Well, a good playing
construction job combined with living in your parents basement tends
to give you a decent disposable income." Anya then spoke from behind
the brown paper. "Something that is going to change soon. RIGHT?"
Xander nodded and smiled at Anya over the ridged top. "Right after I
Go Guard we will go apartment hunting." Faith joined them then. "So
you decided to join the army?" As Faith took one of the bags from Anya
and one of the cases from Giles Buffy was glad her girlfriend was
dressed, but couldn't keep herself from remembering what she looked
like otherwise. </p>

<p>In the very back Willow and Tara squeezed into the filling
entryway, both of them laden with book bags. As they all moved towards
the living room Xander answered Faith's question. "Well I had Giles
swing by the recruitment office on our way back, and from what I
picked up I'm thinking Yo Joe!" They all smiled while Faith led Giles
and Anya to the kitchen. "Yep, I already have the skills, but like
Spike had said I need the conditioning. The easy access to military
made mayhem will help too." Buffy seemed to take a long look at
Xander. "So you're finally finding direction in your life?" He held up
his hands. "I wouldn't go that far, but I'm realizing where I don't
want to be." Willow and Tara were setting their bags down in a
semi-organized pile as the red head spoke. "Does that place include
the parent's basement?" Xander smirked. "That place IS the parent's
basement. The rest is pretty good. I mean I have a GREAT girlfriend."</p>

<p>They all grinned at him as Buffy spoke. "She's not here to
hear that you know?" Xander smiled. "I know." The doors opened as the
missing three rejoined them and Faith walked up to Buffy and gave her
a kiss. "Not here to hear what?" Buffy smiled and kissed Faith back.
"Anya wasn't here to hear Xander compliment her." Anya was already
close to Xander and looked curiously at him. "You complimented me?" He
smiled a bit shyly. "Well yeah, I was just saying that besides the
basement dwelling I have a good life. I mean I have a great
girlfriend." He punctuated that statement by kissing said girlfriend.
"I also have great friends, and while my life might not have direction
it does have purpose." Giles looked at him then. "Yes, but won't you
miss the direction others have?" Xander smirked and gave pointed looks
to Buffy, Faith, Willow, and Tara. "Ok, who would have thought Willow
would have found love with another girl?" </p>

<p>Nobody raised their hands, and that got Tara a questioning
look from Willow. "I… I hoped you would, but I never really thought it
would happen." The two shared a smile as Xander continued. "Ok, who
thought Buffy would."  Willow seemed to look slightly offended at
that. "What? So I was more likely to go gay then Buffy?" She had said
it to herself, but everyone seemed to smile at her comment as Xander
finished. "Now, not only did Buffy switch sides…" Buffy spoke then. "I
did not switch sides. I just expanded my horizons." "Whatever, my
point is not only did you do it, but you did it with your mortal
enemy. Unless of course that was just a funny bruise Faith picked up."
Buffy blushed as Faith smirked as Xander's eyes pointed right at
Faith's hickey. "So all that, and none of it planned." They all
reluctantly nodded. "So I'm happy, healthy, and I have a purpose is
life. Direction just seems like what your doing until life decides
otherwise."</p>

<p>Faith threw her hair back, which showed her hickey for all to
see and Buffy smiled at her indulgently. "Ok, enough deep talk. I mean
I agree, and I don't. If I had planned ahead a bit more I probably
wouldn't have ended up like I did, but I also know my redemption plan
didn't include any of this." Giles took off his glasses and began
cleaning them. "Well put. Now I believe Willow had some files to show
me." Willow looked surprised and then nodded. "Right." She went to one
of the bags and pulled out her laptop as she walked toward a table
Buffy followed. "Giles and a computer. Now THAT'S unplanned." Giles
threw Buffy a slight glare, which made the blonde grin. </p>

<p>"Yes, she has some files on how the control chips were
supposed to work, and I have an extensive knowledge of demon biology."
Buffy looked taken back. "What? Are you going to make a demon army?"
Giles rolled his eyes. "Of course not, but the Initiative's research
was far more advanced then we had thought, and if recent events have
shown us anything it is that they could come back and haunt us. So I
wish to make sure we have SOME familiarity with their tools." </p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "Makes sense." Faith was nodding as well. "Makes
sense for them. They do the thinking, we do the breaking. Come on B,
they rented some movies, and we all earned a break." Willow seemed to
get a slightly down look and they all noticed, but Giles was the first
to comment. "You don't need to stay here Willow. If you can show me
what to do I start the research on the biology, and then you can
instruct me on the technology after the movie." Willow smiled much
broader and her fingers seemed to speed up. </p>

<p>The Scoobies were catching their breath as the credits started
to roll. As they did Faith looked over at Xander. "Excellent movies
choice. What made "Baby Blues" stand out?" He shrugged. "Well it has
Jefferson Blue for our martial artists, and well Kathleen Turner plays
a literal pistol packin momma." Willow then chimed in. "Then there is
her ubersexy voice." Tara nodded in agreement from where she snuggled
with Willow. Xander then sighed. "Well my excellent movie taste aside
how much longer do you think we're going to have to be here?" Giles
spoke up from his position in front of the computer and in the midst
of a sea of books. </p>

<p>"I spoke with the police and they said that the military had
become involved and that Riley Finn is listed as a deserter and so
military police were taking over the investigation." Buffy looked
confused. "So we'll be getting a military guard?" Giles gave her an
admonishing look before turning back to the screen. No, it means that
the military has managed to figure out what happened and are cleaning
up the mess, which includes getting rid of the local police
interference." Xander then looked over at Giles. "Ok, that still
doesn't tell us WHEN." Giles pinched the bridge of his nose. "The
officer had said that the chief of police had extended their overtime
for the next two days, but then he mentioned a call from the governor.
So I figure they will haggle over jurisdiction for awhile, and then
probably have them called back in by midday tomorrow, or the next day
at the most. Which reminds me Buffy, I had spoke to your mother about
the situation so she would be sure not to invite Riley in."</p>

<p>A look of panic crossed her face at the Watcher's statement
and he held up a hand. "I had only told her about that development,
but you may wish to call her. I'm sure with all of the publicized
violence she has grown worried." Buffy seemed reluctant, but support
from the idea came from an unexpected source, Faith. "He's right B.
She is your mom, and even if you keep her out of the active slaying
she's your mom." Buffy looked confused. "You WANT to come out to my
mom?" Buffy could feel a slight tremble as she rested back against
Faith's chest. "WANT to? No, but… trust me on this B, she needs to
feel a part of your life." She turned around in Faith's arms. "Wait,
have you two talked?" Faith shrugged a little bit. "Well, kinda, when
I was holding her hostage, just trust me B. Talk to her." </p>

<p>Buffy seemed to want to ask her more, but she refrained, and
nodded. "All right. I guess I'll go call her." Faith looked concerned.
"Don't tell her over the phone." Buffy looked offended. "I'm not. I'm
just going to invite her over. There's a little bit of daylight, and
if worse comes to worse there should be enough left if she wants to
leave right away." While Buffy had seemed casual when saying the last
part Faith still took her hand and gave it a squeeze. She let go of it
as Buffy pulled away towards the phone, and everyone remained silent
as Buffy dialed. "Hey mom…. Yeah everyone's fine… except Riley… He was
turned into a vampire… I know, thanks… but the rest of us are safe.
Were with Faith at the mansion. Yeah, she and I have worked things
out." The entire room seemed to grin at that. "I was wondering if you
could come here too. There's something I need to talk to you about,
but I have to do it in person. Ok, love you too mom."</p>

<p>Buffy seemed several shades paler as she set the phone down.
"She's on her way." Faith had already stood up and walked over to her.
As the receiver was hung back up she pulled Buffy back to their
position cuddling on the couch. The room was silent as Faith noticed
tears forming around Buffy's eyes. "Faith? Do you think I'm going to
loose my mom?" The entire room seemed to jolt with that question as
Faith squeezed Buffy tighter. "No B, your mom is always your mom. Not
much can change that." "Yeah, but I mean Giles is more like my dad
then my dad is." The watcher seemed to smile at that inspite of the
otherwise gloomy atmosphere. "What ever happens B, you are not alone."
Giles nodded silently and made sure Buffy saw his reassuring smile.</p>

<p>Xander then smiled. "Hey, I have two parents I don't really
need. They're yours if you want them." Everyone laughed at that, but
the room again fell silent as Xander replaced the tape in the VCR. "I
hope everyone is in the mood for a little Star Trek." Only Willow
seemed actually interested as Xander defended his choice. "It's from
Deep Space Nine, and I have a feeling you will like this episode" Ten
minutes after he was proven right as Faith exclaimed. "Those two
chicks with the identical body art are going to get it on, aren't
they?" Xander shook his head. "Nothing full body, but they do share a
terrific kiss in a little bit… or so I heard." They all looked at him.
"Hey, when I saw "Rejoined" on the shelf I thought it went well with
the mood of the evening." They all rolled their eyes, but they all
continued watching., except for Giles who was still pouring through
his research, pausing only for sips of tea.</p>

<p>A short time later the two slayers were wrestling for the
remote. "Give it here Faith!" "Ah come on B, You can't tell me you
don't want to watch that kiss one more time. It's almost as good as
one of yours." The two had tumbled to the floor but continued
wrestling as their friends watched the tape run forward and back.
Suddenly the doorbell sounded and everything seemed to stop, except
the tape, which began running again at normal speed. They sat up
nervously and Faith got up and ran to the door. Her normally confident
demeanor had vanished and she was chewing her bottom lip as she opened
the front door. "Hey Mrs. Summers." It was a chorus that was repeated
as they entered the main living room and Joyce smiled back at them.
Buffy had already stood up. "Hey mom." "Buffy, you sounded worried on
the phone." Buffy nodded and took her moms hand. "I gotta talk with
ya."</p>
