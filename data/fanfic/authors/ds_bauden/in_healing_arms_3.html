<!-- In Healing Arms \ Part Three -->

<p>The first night sleeping in Alex's house was a quiet one for the
			two women, especially Sydney. Even though they fell off to sleep in the wee hours of the
			morning, she still woke up with the birds. She wasn't quite sure what to do with herself,
			since this was the first morning in about three years that she didn't have to tend to the
			horses in Edna's stables. Edna always would ask her to take a vacation, but Sydney would
			always politely decline. </p>

		<p>Syd decided to get up from under the warm assault of Alex's body.
			She managed to sneak out of the bed without waking her. There wasn't an easy way to awaken
			Alex, so she knew she could escape without disturbing her. She walked downstairs and
			started to clean up their mess they had made the previous night. The sight in front of her
			made her smile. Her little surprise paid off in spades. They had both had a wonderful
			time, but Sydney still felt a little guilty for not telling Alex about Sharon and her past
			with her. Syd knew she would probably feel better, but she couldn't stand the thought of
			what Alex would think of her after she knew what was done to her. She didn't want pity,
			she just wished all of the past and all of her thoughts of Sharon, would just go away.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex opened her eyes and noticed right away that she was alone.
			At first she was a little unnerved by this, then she figured that Syd probably got up at
			dawn like she usually does.</p>

		<p>"Does she ever sleep?" She sleepily said to herself.</p>

		<p>Alex got up and put a pair of shorts on and one of Syd's large
			T-shirts on and stumbled into the bathroom. After she finished with her morning
			necessities, she went downstairs in search of Sydney. She found her poolside sunning
			herself. Alex took in the breathtaking sight before her. Sydney had donned her black
			bikini and went out for a morning swim. She did a few laps then lied in the lawnchair to
			get some sunshine. She felt Alex's presence before Alex even said anything to her.</p>

		<p>"Good morning gorgeous." Syd greeted.</p>

		<p>"How do you do that?" Alex marveled.</p>

		<p>"I have many skills." She smiled and squinted up at her
			friend.</p>

		<p>"Yes, I think you have shown me that." Alex smiled
			back. "Did you sleep okay?"</p>

		<p>"Mmm, yes I did. Your bed is quite comfortable."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, I had forgotten what it felt like. I think last night was the first night in
			weeks that I didn't have a nightmare."</p>

		<p>"I was going to say something about that but I didn't want to jinx anything."</p>

		<p>"Thanks for noticing."</p>

		<p>"Hey, when you are concerned, I always notice. In a room of thousands, I would know
			if you were missing."</p>

		<p>"You are sweet." She said as she put her arms around Sydney from behind her
			chair.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but don't let that get around. I got a reputation to uphold."</p>

		<p>"Ooh, right. Sorry." She kissed Sydney's cheek.</p>

		<p>"Are you hungry sweetheart? I think you worked up quite an
			appetite from last night."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but whose fault is that?"</p>

		<p>"Oh I'll take full responsibility for that, with pleasure." She said as she gave
			a full smile to Alex.</p>

		<p>"God you are so beautiful."</p>

		<p>"So are you little one. So are you." She said as she caressed the cheek looking
			down at her. "Let's get some breakfast."</p>

		<p>"Sure. You up for going into town? I really don't want to cook."</p>

		<p>"Alright, let me put something on that's not so revealing, and we can go."</p>

		<p>"Aww and spoil my visual from across a table?"</p>

		<p>"Sorry to disappoint, but I don't think everyone would share your opinion."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I beg to differ. I'm sure there are plenty of people that wouldn't mind the
			view."</p>

		<p>"Well, too bad for them that I am already taken."</p>

		<p>"Yes, terrible shame don't you think?"</p>

		<p>"Not for me. Come on, let's eat."</p>

		<p>"There is a place called The Harbor that I know you will love. They only serve
			breakfast and lunch, but it is the best food around as far as breakfast. They will make
			you any kind of egg that you can think of. It's great stuff. Ooh I can't wait." She
			said clapping and skipping up to the house. Sydney just watched the childlike antics
			coming from Alex with a huge smile.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex drove into town like she was visiting for the first time.
			Her memories of life with her parents seemed so long ago. This was a whole new thing for
			her. She was just grateful that Sydney was there with her. They pulled into the small
			shopping plaza and parked near the restaurant. Alex couldn't believe that she was home
			again.</p>

		<p>"God Sydney, it feels like I have been gone a lifetime. It
			is so strange to be here."</p>

		<p>"I bet honey. Did you want to go in?"</p>

		<p>"In a sec, I just want to look around for a minute."</p>

		<p>Alex just walked through the tiny plaza gazing in every window to see if they had changed
			as much as she had in the last few months. She came across a tiny clothing shop and smiled
			to Sydney.</p>

		<p>"They have the best cashmere sweaters in this place. Mom got me one for Christmas
			last year that is just the best."</p>

		<p>"Did you want to browse for awhile before brunch?" She said looking at her
			watch.</p>

		<p>"Nah, I just liked reminiscing. We can go, I am truly
			hungry."</p>

		<p>"OK hon, let's go. I hope there isn't a long wait."</p>

		<p>"Hopefully not, but unfortunately this place is usually
			packed around lunchtime. Lots of business people come here from all over just to eat here.
			It's really great."</p>

		<p>"Can't wait, let's go and get our name in."</p>

		<p>Looking up from her menus the hostess asked, "How many?"</p>

		<p>"Just the two of us." Alex replied.</p>

		<p>"Name?"</p>

		<p>"McKenna."</p>

		<p>"McKenna?" The hostess asked again.</p>

		<p>"Yes Alex McKenna."</p>

		<p>"Wow, you probably don't remember me, it's Melissa Milo, we went to the high school
			together."</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, Melissa, how are you?"</p>

		<p>"I am doing well. I heard about what happened to your parents. I am so sorry. Your
			father helped a lot of this town's "Most Stressed"."</p>

		<p>"Thanks. It's been a rough year but I have had a lot of help from some really
			wonderful people. My dad loved what he did and really cared about his patients. I know a
			lot of people will miss him."</p>

		<p>"Yes that's true. Umm, the wait will only be a few more minutes."</p>

		<p>"That's all? This placed is jammed." Alex said as she looked around the
			restaurant.</p>

		<p>"I'll get you in. I have a little bit of an edge over these people."</p>

		<p>"Thanks Melissa." Alex gratefully smiled.</p>

		<p>"Sure Alex, take care." Melissa said with a sincere smile.</p>

		<p>"You too, good to see you."</p>

		<p>"You too." She replied as she walked towards oncoming
			guests.</p>

		<p>"She seemed nice." Syd chimed in.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, she was extremely quiet in high school. You could be
			guaranteed a smile from her though if you said hello. She was one of those people who you
			knew would be a loyal friend. You know?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, so why didn't you hang with her?"</p>

		<p>"We hung out in different circles I guess you could say. Funny, I don't really see or
			talk to any of those people now. My only constant has been Tracey."</p>

		<p>"They say people change their ways in time. Those others weren't meant to be your
			friends."</p>

		<p>"I guess not. I didn't even hear from alot of them when my parents died."</p>

		<p>"That's terrible. I'm sorry."</p>

		<p>"What for? I am much better off without them." Alex said confidently.</p>

		<p>A voice came from the front counter. "McKenna, party of
			two."</p>

		<p>"That's us, come on!" Alex jumped from the waiting
			seats.</p>

		<p>"Right behind you." Syd chuckled at her obviously
			hungry partner.</p>

		<p>The two women were seated in a large booth in the upper level of
			the restaurant. Syd just looked around in disbelief at a place being so crowded that only
			served two meals out of the day.</p>

		<p>"It's really nice in here."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, like I said a lot of people come here from all over. I think some just spend
			their lunch hour in the car to get here."</p>

		<p>"Wow, it must have a great reputation." Sydney added.</p>

		<p>"Yes it does, and it seems to be growing."</p>

		<p>A waitress arrived at their table, "What can I get you ladies? Anything cold to drink
			today?"</p>

		<p>"I'll just have water." Sydney said.</p>

		<p>"Will that be bottled, filtered, mineral, carbonated,
			caffeinated or tap?"</p>

		<p>Sydney just stared at Alex with her mouth open and eyes wide. She then returned her stare
			to the waitress. Alex had to stifle her laugh with her hand.</p>

		<p>"Umm, I guess tap is fine."</p>

		<p>"Lemon or no lemon?"</p>

		<p>'Christ I just want a glass of water!!' She thought to herself. "No lemon...thank
			you."</p>

		<p>"And you miss?" The waitress turned to Alex.</p>

		<p>"I'll have what she's having." Alex said as she stopped
			herself from laughing out loud.</p>

		<p>The waitress flipped her pad closed, smiled, and walked to get their innocuous beverages.</p>

		<p>"Oh......my God. All I asked for was water. I never really
			thought about how many different ways people would drink it. Jesus!!" Syd said while
			still wide eyed.</p>

		<p>Laughing with her, "I know, I wasn't sure if I should stop her to take a breath or
			not. Nothing is simple anymore, you know? Not EVEN water." She said looking at her
			menu, "What are you going to get?"</p>

		<p>"God, I have no idea. If ordering water was this much trouble, I am afraid to order
			anything of substance."</p>

		<p>Giggling, "Don't be, just get what you want. I'm sure they can make anything that you
			like."</p>

		<p>"We'll see." She said smiling.</p>

		<p>The waitress came back with their glasses of tap water, and
			opened her pad up to take the ladies' orders. Her eyes widened with the amount of food
			that Alex ordered. Sydney struggled through the ordering process and hoped to get her food
			the way she liked. Alex seemed confident that she would.</p>

		<p>"Would you excuse me Alex, I am going to visit the ladies
			room. Where is it, do you know?"</p>

		<p>"Umm...yeah... it's over by the kitchen area...see the arrow?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, thanks hon. See you in a bit."</p>

		<p>"OK." Alex answered as she grabbed a package of
			breadsticks and began dipping them into the butter. "Mmm, God I am so hungry."
			She said to the empty seat across from her.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney walked into the ladies room and did what she needed to do in there. She walked out
			of the stall and walked towards the sink to wash her hands and face. She rinsed off her
			face and felt a towel being held out to her. She accepted it and dried her face.</p>

		<p>"Thanks..." Her words stopped cold when her eyes met
			with dark brown ones.</p>

		<p>"Hello Sydney. My my my, what a small world it is."
			Sharon chuckled.</p>

		<p>"What the hell are you doing here?" Syd nearly spat
			trying to control her emotions.</p>

		<p>"Now Sydney is that anyway to treat an old friend?" She
			crooned.</p>

		<p>"You are NOT my friend. Have you been following me? What the
			hell do you want from me? Answer my question!" She said very impatiently.</p>

		<p>"Following you? My aren't we the arrogant one. Don't flatter yourself darling, I am
			here on business."</p>

		<p>"Business?" She said disbelieving.</p>

		<p>"Yes darling, daddy's little company is planning a merger with one of the big boys of
			the Midwest. He sent me to..."</p>

		<p>"To use your only attribute? He wanted you to seduce the big boys into seeing things
			"your way"? Right? You make me sick." She tried to push away from the
			platinum blonde invading her space.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, you can't still be angry with me, can you?"</p>

		<p>"Sharon, I don't feel anything but pity for you. Is there anything else?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, you can tell me the name of that fine little thing sitting with you."</p>

		<p>Sydney couldn't control her temper any longer. She threw Sharon up against the wall and
			pinned her forearm under the blonde's throat. "You even breathe on her, and I will
			rip you apart with my bare hands. Do you understand me?"</p>

		<p>"That's alright Sydney, I know all about young Alexandra.
			Shame what happened to her parents. I bet she is desperate need of comfort. I'm sure I
			could..." Sharon was cut off by added pressure of Sydney's arm at her throat.</p>

		<p>"You know what Sharon? You have about two seconds to shut
			the fuck up before I kill your whoring ass. Leave her alone you psychotic freak or I swear
			to you...." Sydney hissed at Sharon.</p>

		<p>Laughing through her gritted teeth. "Oh Sydney...God I forgot how sexy you are.
			Especially when you get angry. Does she see that angry side of you Sydney? Does she know
			what a bad ass you are Sydney? Does she know about Billy? I bet you didn't tell her about
			that, did you?" Sharon paused and watched proudly as her words dug into Syd like
			daggers. "Does she see that aggressive sexual side of you? Does she like it rough
			like I did... Sydney?" The blonde taunted. Sydney's breath was coming in short gusts
			of emotion. Sharon just laughed and smiled. "Hmm?"</p>

		<p>"You stay away from her Sharon. She is NOTHING like you!!! You harm one hair on her
			head, I swear to you; I will make it my purpose in life to make yours a living hell. If
			you even SPEAK my brother's name again, I will be your greatest nightmare. I promise you
			that." She seductively hissed into Sharon's ear. </p>

		<p>"Ooh baby, I'm getting so hot. Talk to me some more."
			She said as she licked her lips.</p>

		<p>"God you are disgusting!!" Sydney spat as she let go of
			her hold on Sharon. She pointed her finger at Sharon in warning. "If you do anything,
			or say anything to her, I'll come after you." She said and walked out of the ladies'
			room leaving an amused Sharon behind to straighten her suit. Sharon smiled at her
			reflection.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, you ain't seen nothing yet." She smiled
			with aplomb.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney stormed out of the ladies room and stopped to collect
			herself. She stood behind the wall separating the restrooms from the main room of the
			restaurant. After taking a few breaths, she made her way back to the table to where Alex
			was seated.</p>

		<p>"Hey sweetie, are you alright? You look a little pale."
			Alex observed.</p>

		<p>"Alex......I...." Syd started as she sat down.</p>

		<p>"Here we are..." The waitress came just as Sydney began to tell Alex what had
			happened.</p>

		<p>"Scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and an English muffin with
			strawberry jam." She said as she put Sydney's plate down in front of her.</p>

		<p>"And for you, we have a three egg four cheese omelet, a side
			of bacon, a side of sausage, a small stack of blueberry pancakes, hash browns, an English
			muffin with grape jelly, a glass of milk, and two glasses of orange juice. Honey, I don't
			know where you are going to put this, but bon appet"t." She said as she
			sauntered off to another table.</p>

		<p>"Oooo, look at this, God I am so hungry. Dig in
			sweetheart." Alex said excitedly as she began to eat as if she hadn't in a week.</p>

		<p>Sydney watched the younger woman consume huge amounts of food as
			she sat and stared at her full plate.</p>

		<p>"Shydnee, are yooo k?" Alex said with a partially full
			mouth as she noticed Syd not eating.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, um, I think I lost my appetite. I'm not feeling that
			well all of a sudden. Maybe it's a little flu left from last night." She lied.</p>

		<p>"Oh honey, I'm sorry. I forgot about that. God, I'm so
			sorry. We can take this to go so we can get back home." Alex compromised.</p>

		<p>"NO! Please finish your meal. You know how much I love to
			watch you eat." She tried to sincerely smile but it just wasn't coming through, and
			Alex saw right through it.</p>

		<p>"Sydney what is wrong, honey? Please tell me." Alex
			almost pleaded. </p>

		<p>"I will tell you, but just not here, and just not now. When
			the time is right Alex, when the time is right." Syd explained.</p>

		<p>"OK, I will hold you to that baby. You can tell me anything.
			It won't change the way I feel about you, nothing could."</p>

		<p>"Thanks sweetheart, I don't know what I would do without you." She reached
			across the table to hold Alex's hand.</p>

		<p>Sharon strolled out of the ladies room and glanced up at Sydney.
			They made eye contact, Sharon winked at her, smiled, then strut out of the restaurant.
			Sydney swallowed her emotions as she watched Sharon leave and gently caressed Alex's hand.
			Alex looked up from her meal and smiled at Sydney. She continued to devour the food in
			front of her until there was nothing but crumbs left. The waitress came by and in
			disbelief and took Alex's empty plates. She tossed away Sydney's uneaten eggs as per
			Sydney's request. 'Who likes to eat reheated eggs anyway?' Syd thought to herself.</p>

		<p>Alex and Sydney walked up to the counter and Sydney insisted on
			paying for their meal. With a final huff, Alex agreed to let her pay and they left the
			restaurant. The two were quiet on the way home and Alex couldn't help but wonder what had
			set Sydney off. She was never like this. Alex looked over at her partner and saw the lost
			look on her face as she stared out the window.</p>

		<p>'What is going on with you baby? God I wish you would just tell
			me. It can't be that bad. It can't be...' Alex thought to herself as they pulled into her
			driveway.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex went into the garage to get the last of the boxes she had to
			pack up the rest of her things. She had decided with Edna that the best way to handle all
			of the furniture in the house was to have an estate sale. Whatever she could sell she
			would, and whatever she couldn't she would donate or throw away. She had gone through
			quite a bit before moving to Montana, but there was more than ten years worth of stuff
			here. Tracey had helped her on more than one occasion get her ready for her big move. Her
			mother's jewelry and clothing had been sorted and given away. What people didn't want she
			donated to the Salvation Army. She had kept her mother's wedding ring set for herself. It
			was always a favorite of hers and she knew her mom would have wanted her to have it. There
			were a few items of her clothing that had extreme sentimental value to them, so she kept
			them as well. Her mother had recently gone to Paris and had brought back some wonderful
			perfume, Boucheron. On days when Alex really missed her, she would spray it into the air
			just to have her scent nearby.</p>

		<p>Alex cleaned out her parent's room in a few hours while Sydney
			decided to take care of the living and dining rooms downstairs. Sydney took this time to
			wonder why Sharon was in town, and how she knew about Alex. She was shaking with feelings
			she hadn't felt in a long time. She was angry, nervous, and most of all she was in shock.
			Seeing Sharon was not on her things to do list for the day, and really was playing with
			her head.</p>

		<p>'God, what the hell is she doing here anyway? How does she know
			about Alexandra and what happened to her parents? It's not like she gives a shit about the
			human race, well only if she gets to sleep with them. Uugghhh, why the hell did she have
			to show up?' Sydney was reeling in her mind as Alex walked downstairs to meet her.</p>

		<p>"Hey baby, feeling any better?" Alex asked
			sympathetically.</p>

		<p>"Yeah I guess a little." She lied.</p>

		<p>"Are you hungry at all? I could make you something to eat
			since you didn't get anything at the restaurant."</p>

		<p>"No sweetheart that is okay, I don't really feel up to eating. Did you talk to Tracey
			at all? Does she want to go out this evening?"</p>

		<p>"I did get a chance to talk with her briefly after lunch but her new girlfriend wants
			to spend time with her tonight. So I guess its just you and me tonight."</p>

		<p>"Ohh, new girlfriend eh? Is she cute?" Alex wiggled her eyebrows.</p>

		<p>"Well according to Trace, she is a "hotty". I
			guess they finally had sex, which is weird I think."</p>

		<p>"Sex with your girlfriend is weird? Um, I think you had better talk to mine then,
			'cause she kind of likes that."</p>

		<p>Laughing, "Ha ha, no I mean it's kinda soon for Tracey. She was the type to wait a
			while before making that kind of commitment. She has only known this woman, um, Char I
			think her name is, for a couple months."</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, I hate to break it to you, but you and I made love within days of knowing
			each other."</p>

		<p>"I know, but I am not Tracey, nor do I think it is the same. Char is a business
			associate of Tracey's. They have only really seen each other like four or five
			times."</p>

		<p>"Oh, so she's isn't from around here?"</p>

		<p>"No I think she is on the West Coast somewhere. LA maybe? I don't remember. Anyway,
			she just arrived and is actually staying for a week or so this time, so maybe we'll get to
			meet her."</p>

		<p>"Great, maybe we can get together or something with them for dinner or what
			not."</p>

		<p>"I think that is a great idea. I really want to meet the woman who made Tracey's
			morals go right down the crapper!!" She said with a large smile.</p>

		<p>"Well I'm sure she is something else if she broke down
			Tracey's walls so easily."</p>

		<p>"Well, I guess we have to wait to find out."</p>

		<p>"Yep." Sydney agreed. "Ah, I got most of these rooms in boxes for the sale.
			Did you want any of this stuff? There is some really nice porcelain statues and things
			here."</p>

		<p>"No, I pretty much went through and kept all that I wanted to keep, as did Edna. My
			other family really didn't come around that much so I don't think they are getting any of
			it. I think I would rather sell it or donate the rest. It looks so damn empty in here.
			It's like someone else's house."</p>

		<p>Sydney wrapped her arms around Alex. "I know baby. How are you holding up? Can I do
			anything for you?" Syd asked sincerely.</p>

		<p>"You just being here with me is all I will ever need. Thank
			you for coming here with me. I'm not sure I would be this together had you not."</p>

		<p>"Where you go, I go, get used to it." She smiled into the top of Alex's head.</p>

		<p>"That's easy enough." Alex tightened her hold on her.
			'I love you baby' She thought to herself.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>ONE WEEK LATER</p>

		<p>"So everything is a go for tomorrow night?" Sydney asked Tracey quietly.</p>

		<p>"Yes, I have called all of our friends and Edna should
			arrive early tomorrow morning. I will pick her up from the airport and keep her with me
			until the evening. Are you sure she has no idea?" Tracey inquired insistently.</p>

		<p>"No Tracey, she hasn't the foggiest. I can't wait! She needs
			this so much. I think a night spent with old friends in celebration will be exactly what
			she needs to give her some kind of closure here. And Tracey?" Syd prompted.</p>

		<p>"Yeah?" She responded.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for this. You are truly a good friend. I can see
			why she speaks so highly of you."</p>

		<p>"Right back atcha babe. She is so smitten with you. I have never seen her this happy.
			So I guess thanks are in order to you."</p>

		<p>"I really care about Alexandra. I wouldn't hurt her for anything in the world. I
			would rather spit on the Pope than break her heart."</p>

		<p>"That's a lovely visual, but I get your meaning."</p>

		<p>"Alright then. I guess the last thing is to make sure we have enough to drink, the
			catering place knows the time and place. This is going to be a night that we all will
			remember, for a long time."</p>

		<p>"I hope so, Sydney."</p>

		<p>"Me too. I've got to run. Ciao." Sydney hung up abruptly.</p>

		<p>"Ciao?" Tracey smirked as she hung up the phone. "Alex, you've got yourself
			an incredible woman." She said as she snuggled up to Char. "And so do I."
			Tracey said as she kissed the smiling face looking up at her. "Babe, you are going to
			love Alex and Sydney. They are so awesome. I can't wait. Alex is going to be so
			surprised!"</p>

		<p>'So is Sydney.' Sharon smirked into Tracey's body. "I can't wait to see her
			expression!! God how I love surprises." Although it was Sydney's surprise Sharon was
			after, not Alex's.</p>

		<p>"Me too Char, me too."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tracey knew Char from Backburn Inc. a small software company
			looking to expand their company to the Midwest. Char came into Chicago to make a play for
			her company. Tracey being one of the research managers decided to meet with her to talk
			about her father's ideas of coming to the Midwest. They met a couple of months ago and
			have seen each other a few times to discuss their companies and what they might offer one
			another. Talking at a restaurant the two women discussed many things outside of work. They
			both discovered that they enjoyed the company of women, and made a point to see each other
			the next time Char came into town. Tracey could not wait. Char was a beautiful woman
			blonde hair, deep brown eyes and a beautifully shaped mouth. She stood about 5'8" and
			had absolutely no body fat. To Tracey she wreaked perfection. </p>

		<p>Char came into Chicago to check the status of their merger and,
			of course, to see Tracey. The two were fast becoming more than friends. The distance was
			the only thing to come between them. Tracey and Char consummated their relationship after
			Char's third visit to Chicago. Tracey was not one for casual sex, but there was nothing
			casual about Char. She was extraordinarily exciting. </p>

		<p>Everything about her was a mystery to Tracey. She seemed very
			elusive about her past, it was obvious she had been hurt and did not want to reopen old
			wounds. After Tracey had unsuccessfully asked her about it, she decided to leave well
			enough alone. Char didn't come in that often, so she just wanted to enjoy what little time
			they had together. Tracey was so excited about her enigmatic lover she couldn't wait for
			Alex to meet her. Tracey told Alex about Char the day she met her:</p>

		<p>"Hello?" Alex answered.</p>

		<p>"Hey baby!!"</p>

		<p>"Trace!! How are you honey? God I miss you."</p>

		<p>"Me too, I am really good. How are you doing?" Tracey asked tenderly.</p>

		<p>"Things are alright Tracey. They get better each day. Sydney
			has been a great support to me. I can't wait for you two to meet. You are going to love
			her!!!"</p>

		<p>"Well, I have some news myself."</p>

		<p>"Do you??? Who did you meet and where?" Alex laughed knowing full well it had to
			be a woman.</p>

		<p>"Alex, God, she is such a hotty!! She is like 5'8",
			blonde with brown eyes and a body do die for. There is no pinchability on this woman. The
			girl is tight!!" She said exuberantly.</p>

		<p>"Wow Trace, she sounds fabulous. I can't wait to meet her.
			Where did you guys hook up?"</p>

		<p>"Wanna hear something funny? We met at work. I was just saying how horrid it was
			working here since their was no eye candy, then in walks Char. God, she took my breath
			away. Girl she is soooo sexy. She could turn any straight woman, I am sure of it. God
			Damn!!"</p>

		<p>"Damn Trace, sounds like you got a keeper there. Have you gone out yet? Like on a
			date or anything?"</p>

		<p>"Well that's the problem. We went out once after one of our meetings to a restaurant
			and we just clicked. We talked about everything. I talked about you and Sydney and how
			long you and I have known each other. I mean we just talked and talked. I haven't met a
			woman that could hold a conversation like that in a long time. I was ready to swear off
			intelligent women because I didn't think they existed anymore!" They chuckled to each
			other. "No, seriously she is really amazing Alex."</p>

		<p>"I am so happy for you. But wait, you mentioned a problem?"</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, um well, she lives in California. She works for a small software company
			that wants to move to the Midwest. So we are looking to do a small expansion to bring them
			over here. Blah blah you don't need to hear that part, that's the boring stuff. So she
			came out here to talk to some companies and she found us. The rest is history. So the
			problem is she lives across the country. I don't know if I am up for a long distance
			relationship. I mean, part of me says "Man, go get her!", then the sensible part
			of me says "No, it'll be too hard on you." I don't know what to do, but for
			right now, she is all I can think about."</p>

		<p>"Well see what happens the next time she comes into town and play it from
			there."</p>

		<p>"I guess you're right, but man. My luck huh? I finally find a "Woo!" girl
			and she lives two thousand miles away."</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry Trace. Um, on a happier note, I think I'll be coming home in a month or
			so."</p>

		<p>"Really? That is awesome!! I really miss you Alex."</p>

		<p>"Me too hon. I am gonna sell the house, so I need to pack up and get it ready to
			sell. It'll probably be at the end of September."</p>

		<p>"Kick ass, I can't wait to see you. I can't wait to meet Sydney. She sounds
			wonderful."</p>

		<p>"She is Trace she is. But ah, I gotta get going so I will call you with information
			on when I'll be coming home okay?"</p>

		<p>"OK hon, take care of yourself, I love you."</p>

		<p>"I love you too Trace. I'll talk with you soon. Bye."</p>

		<p>"Bye."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Who was that on the phone hon?" Alex asked a startled
			Sydney.</p>

		<p>"Um, it was Tracey, I thought you were going to take a
			nap?" Sydney quickly replied.</p>

		<p>"No I couldn't sleep. What did she want?"</p>

		<p>"Well she wanted to see what we were doing tomorrow night. I guess she wants to
			introduce her new girlfriend to us."</p>

		<p>"Ooh cool!! I should call her back." Alex said excitedly.</p>

		<p>"No!" Alex raised her eyebrows at Sydney's tone of voice. Thinking quickly
			Sydney said, "Um, well she said they were going out and she would call you in the
			morning or something."</p>

		<p>Sighing, "Alright I guess I'll talk to her tomorrow
			then." Alex took a look around and saw that the entire downstairs had been cleaned.
			"My goodness Sydney. Look at all the work you did. This place is immaculate. You can
			actually hear an echo now. Thank you so much for all of your help. I couldn't have done
			all of this without you."</p>

		<p>"You are most welcome sweetheart. I just want everything to go smoothly and as
			pain-free as possible for you. I know how hard this must be. I remember when we had to
			pack up my mom's belongings. It was really hard on my brother and me. She was all that we
			had left after dad and.....um....well after he died. I can't imagine what you must be
			going through. I, at least had Tim."</p>

		<p>"Well Miss Sydney, I have you, and Eddi and I have Tracey.
			So I think I am doing just fine. Thank you for your concern though." She said as she
			circled her arms around Syd's larger frame and laid her head against her chest. </p>

		<p>"You're welcome baby." Syd murmured into Alex. They sat
			like that for several minutes and enjoyed the peace that passed between them.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney couldn't wait for the festivities to begin. She was
			determined to make this the best birthday Alex ever had. She was fighting a mental battle
			with herself and decided that she was going to bite the bullet and tell Alex that she
			loved her tonight. She had purchased Alex's birthday present when Alex was sleeping in.
			She found her way into town and went in to the town's jewelers. Her eyes immediately
			fixated on a simple gold band with several tiny diamonds embedded in it. </p>

		<p>"Ooh, I like that one, may I see it please?" Syd
			pointed inside the glass case.</p>

		<p>"Absolutely, it is quite an eye catcher." The jeweler opened the case and took
			out the ring and handed it to Sydney.</p>

		<p>Sydney fingered the small band and decided it was simple yet classy, just like Alexandra.
			It was perfect.</p>

		<p>"Can I have it engraved today? I need it for tonight."</p>

		<p>"As luck would have it, my engraver is working today which is rare for a Saturday.
			Let me ask him if he has anything else lined up." He said as he smiled at his
			customer. "Just give me a minute, I'll be right back." He took the ring in
			question with him to the back of the store. He went into the storeroom and looked for his
			employee. </p>

		<p>Several moments had passed when the stocky man returned with a
			smile on his face.</p>

		<p>"Well ma'am, you are in luck. He said he would take care of
			this for you while you waited. Do you have a few minutes?"</p>

		<p>Excitedly Sydney shook her head. "Yes I do, thank you so very much. This will mean a
			great deal to a very special person." She gave the man a dazzling smile to which he
			found himself hypnotized by.</p>

		<p>Shaking himself out of his reverie, he began filling out the
			invoice. Sydney gave him Alex's ring size and what she wanted engraved on it. Within a
			half hour she had her gift and was on her way home.</p>

		<p>"Now if I can keep this courage I will give it to her
			tonight. I don't know what I am worried about. Alexandra is nothing like Sharon. I just
			have to keep reminding myself of that. They are nothing alike, thank God." She said
			to herself as she pulled into the driveway. </p>

		<p>She parked the car in the garage and went into the house to wake
			her sleeping woman. She walked up the stairs and into Alex's room to find a breathtaking
			view. Alex had rolled onto her stomach while clutching her pillow. Her naked form was only
			covered from her waist down. Her knee was sticking out of the sheet and slightly hanging
			over the bed's edge. Her golden locks were spilled down her back and shoulders with a few
			stray strands falling into her face. She was absolutely beautiful. Suddenly Syd's fears
			all seemed to disappear with one look at Alexandra. Seeing this angel before her
			completely dissolved any reservations she'd had in proclaiming her love.</p>

		<p>After taking a moment to memorize every curve of Alex's lithe
			form, she decided to kick off her shoes and curl up next to her. </p>

		<p>Alex immediately felt Sydney's presence and rolled her back into
			Sydney's front. Sydney's arm draped around Alex's waist in reflex, and the rest of her
			body spooned into Alex's back. It was a perfect fit. </p>

		<p>Sydney just lay there smelling the wonderful scent that was Alex.
			Her hair smelled like flowers and her body emitted a fragrance that was crisp and clean.
			Sydney would have stayed like that all morning, but Alex stirred awake and rolled towards
			Sydney.</p>

		<p>"Mm, good morning sweetheart." Alex sleepily said.</p>

		<p>"Good morning sleepy head. Did you sleep well?"</p>

		<p>"Mmhmm, I did. I have slept so well since coming home. I hope I don't get spoiled by
			this."</p>

		<p>"I think you have just been really tired. We have been doing alot since we got here.
			You are just tuckered out."</p>

		<p>"Perhaps. Have you been up long?"</p>

		<p>"Nah, just an hour or so. I couldn't resist coming back to snuggle with you. You
			looked so damn cute."</p>

		<p>Alex just smiled into Sydney's chest and inhaled deeply. She loved the way this woman
			smelled. She had this wonderful musk about her that was all her own. It was intoxicating
			as well as arousing. She could feel Sydney's fingernails moving up and down her back and
			she felt the gooseflesh rising. The touches became more urgent as did the need to be one
			with each other. Alex tilted her head up and captured Syd's wanting mouth with her own.
			Their tongues instantly sought out the other's. They tenderly stroked each other's tongues
			and nipped at each other's lips. Alex caught Sydney's bottom lip and began to suck on it.
			She fully pressed her mouth against Sydney's again and felt a bolt of desire wash over
			her. Sydney caught Alex's moan in her mouth and immediately wanted to be naked against
			this woman. Alex looked into deep stormy blue eyes and knew that breakfast was not going
			to be an option this morning.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"OK Edna, I am gonna take her out for about an hour, I'll
			make something up. I know, I'll make her take me to the beach. She wanted to go there
			yesterday and I wasn't in the mood. So I'll make her take me there while you guys pile
			into the house. The caterers will be there shortly after we leave. We just need to check
			on the beverages. I ordered a bunch from Terry's Liquors and we just need to pick it up. I
			couldn't very well bring a bunch of alcohol into the house without explanation. After we
			surprise her, I will run out and get the drinks. Sound like a plan?"</p>

		<p>"Okay, Syd, this is going to be so great. It sounds like you have it planned and
			ready to go. She is going to be so surprised! Tracey and I will be around the corner. We
			will watch for your car to leave and we will pull up, so make sure you don't forget
			anything, okay?"</p>

		<p>"Alright Edna, I am so glad that you could make it. You being here will make it all
			that much more special for her. She loves you so much."</p>

		<p>"I know. I can say the same about you dear."</p>

		<p>Sydney could feel the blush creep up her neck. "Thanks for saying so Edna. I'll see
			you all in about two hours. Hey, is Tracey's girlfriend coming too? I know that Alex is
			really looking forward to meeting her."</p>

		<p>"Yes, she will be here later. Tracey said she had some things to do before-hand, so
			she wouldn't be able to make it in time for the surprise."</p>

		<p>"Ok, at least she is coming. OK let me think here for a sec. I do believe that is
			everything. I'll see you soon Edna."</p>

		<p>"Okay, dear, make this work dammit. I didn't come all this way for nothin!" She
			kidded.</p>

		<p>"No problem, Alex has no idea. I gotta run she's out of the
			shower, the water just turned off. Bye." She whispered and gently hung up the
			receiver.</p>

		<p>Sydney took one last look around and saw that none of the party
			favors were in sight. She smiled to herself and went upstairs into Alex's bedroom to
			change and waited for her love to exit the bathroom.</p>

		<p>The door opened and steam billowed from the bathroom. Alex walked
			into her room to find Sydney dressing and smirking at her with her jeans part way open.</p>

		<p>"Well, don't you look like the cat who just swallowed the
			canary. What's up with that smirk?" Alex teased.</p>

		<p>"Nothin baby, you just look so sexy, I can't help myself." Sydney purred.</p>

		<p>"Mmhhmm, whatever you say. You look great Sydney, are we going somewhere?"</p>

		<p>"I'm not sure yet, I thought you liked it when I dressed like this."</p>

		<p>"When you wear those black jeans you have the greatest butt in the world. It makes me
			want to squeeze it!!" Alex grinned devilishly.</p>

		<p>"I think we have squeezed enough body parts for one day,
			don't you?"</p>

		<p>"Says you! I could do it all day long. You must be getting old."</p>

		<p>"Old my ass, I'll show you old!!" She laughed and threw Alex on the bed and
			mercilessly began tickling her. Alex tried really hard to pretend that it had no effect on
			her but she couldn't fake it for long.</p>

		<p>"I GIVE!!!!!!!!!!" Alex panted. "Please...oh
			Syd....stop...please!!" She managed to get out between giggle fits. </p>

		<p>Sydney ceased her attack and gently kissed Alex's cheek. She
			helped her up and walked to the closet to look for an outfit for Alex to wear. Alex jumped
			into the bathroom to dry her hair and apply a small amount of makeup to her face. When she
			was finished she went back to her room and found Sydney holding up some of Alex's
			clothing.</p>

		<p>"I would like you to wear this tonight."</p>

		<p>"Sydney, what's going on? Are you taking me to dinner?"</p>

		<p>"Mmmaybe. We haven't heard from Tracey yet about her meeting up with us, so I figured
			we should get ready anyway. If she doesn't call we'll go out, just the two of us. If she
			does call, we still go out. Sound good?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, I never knew you liked these pants so much. I would have worn them more
			often."</p>

		<p>"Well speaking of nice butts, your's looks fabulous in those black slacks. I like the
			vest with that shirt too." Sydney pointed as Alex dressed under instruction for the
			first time since the first grade. </p>

		<p>"Shoes Miss Sydney? What shoes?"</p>

		<p>"No shoes, wear your black boots. That will finish it off just right." Syd said
			as she watched Alex put the finishing touches on her outfit.</p>

		<p>"See now? You have brought a little bit of the country home
			to you. You are beautiful Alexandra." Syd said as she kissed her gently on the lips. </p>

		<p>Alex turned around in the mirror to see what Syd saw in her. She
			had on a black pair of pants, a long sleeved white collarless shirt with her sleeves
			rolled up, a black vest and black boots. "I look like a bank robber. All I need is a
			black cowboy hat and a trusty steed and I'll be on my way!" She joked.</p>

		<p>"You look very sexy, trust me. Although seeing you on a horse always has been a
			favorite of mine. It must be looking at your legs straddling something that really gets me
			going."</p>

		<p>"You are encourageable Sydney Thompson!!"</p>

		<p>"Always. Now let me get finished here."</p>

		<p>Sydney went to the closet again and pulled out a finely knit, gray, cropped V-Neck sweater
			and pulled it over her head. It fit snugly against her muscular torso and showed her belly
			when she raised her arms. She wrapped a black braided belt through her belt loops and
			looked for the right shoes. She slipped on a pair of black loafers and brushed her hair so
			it loosely fell across her back. She added a little color to her lips and eyes and she was
			ready. Alex took a breath and slowly let it out. Syd's raven hair mixed with her cerulean
			eyes and dark clothing made her look like nothing Alex had ever seen before. Sydney was
			stunning.</p>

		<p>"I thought we could take a drive down to that beach you
			wanted to show me. I bet the colors down there are beautiful this time of year."</p>

		<p>"Ooh Sydney, that would be wonderful. It is gorgeous around this time. You really
			want to? It may get a little chilly." Alex sincerely questioned.</p>

		<p>"Well that's why I'll have you on my arm, to keep me
			warm." She answered before she gave Alex a full smile, melting the young girl's
			heart. "Come on then, let's get this night underway."</p>

		<p>"After you my dear." Alex gestured towards the stairs.</p>

		<p>The two walked arm in arm down the stairs and grabbed their
			jackets. They got into the car and pulled slowly out of the driveway. Once they rounded
			the corner, Tracey and Edna pulled into the driveway and headed up to the house. There was
			lots to do in the next hour to make this a night to remember.</p>
