	<chapter>
		<p>The sun was beating down on the car transporting young
			Alicia to her new surroundings. The ride was a long one from the airport to
			her aunt's ranch. It took her a long time to make the decision of leaving
			her home after her parents had passed away, but her aunt had offered and she
			took her up on it. Her Aunt Edna was a very loving woman in her own right. She
			had been a second mother to Ally, as she preferred to be called, since she could
			remember. Most of all, Edna was her friend.</p>
		<p>Ally received the news of her parents' car accident
			six weeks ago. The loss left her entirely empty and unknowing what to do with
			the rest of her life. She was a young nineteen and had just finished her first
			year of college. Her entire life was never filled with such pain as she felt
			now. A new start was in order, and hopefully, that life, would begin with her
			aunt on her ranch. She raked her hand through her long blonde hair, and felt
			completely numb as the car pulled into the main house driveway. </p>
		<p>'Here we go' she thought out loud to herself
			as the car came to a stop.</p>
		<p>Ally saw her aunt racing down the drive to meet her niece
			with open arms.</p>
		<p>"Ally! Ally! You made it!" she howled as she grabbed
			her niece in to a warm and full embrace. "I'm so glad you came."</p>
		<p>"Hi Eddi! I am so glad to see you too! I've missed you
			terribly." She held on as the tears came to her eyes and flowed freely down
			her cheeks.</p>
		<p>"Let me look at you, darlin." She focused on the frail
			body in front of her. "Alicia, starving yourself won't bring them back."
			she whispered into her niece's ear as she held the small woman in her arms
			again.</p>
		<p>"I know, Eddi, I just don't have much of an appetite
			these days. Looks to me like you are doing well though." She poked her plump
			aunt in her belly and smiled a brilliant smile, while wiping her tears away.</p>
		<p>"There's the girl I love. Let's see if we can
			keep her around for awhile, shall we?"</p>
		<p>"I'll do my best. Where is Jack, I haven't
			seen him in ages."</p>
		<p>"He isn't here right now. He had some meeting to attend to in Phoenix.
			He should be here in a week or so. Don't you worry, he's excited to
			see you too."</p>
		<p>"Well, good. We used to see each other all the time when he was working around
			Chicago, but since he moved out here with you, I think it has been four or five
			years since I have seen him."</p>
		<p>"Let's get you settled in, honey, and I'll
			put on some tea. We can talk more in the kitchen ok?"</p>
		<p>"Alright. I have my whole life in these bags, God, I
			just can't believe this happened."</p>
		<p>"I know, Sweetie, I know..." She draped her arm around Ally as they walked towards
			the main house.</p>
		<p>The main house was an old country house. The front door
			had an old brass knocker on the front and a thumb latch door handle. As soon
			as she grasped the handle, she was immediately flooded with memories of her
			childhood. Ally loved this house. She spent many summers here with her aunt,
			uncle, and cousin. Her Uncle John died a few years ago from a heart attack.
			He was training one of the horses and collapsed one afternoon. Edna was out
			in the back when she saw him go down. She ran to him, but he was already gone
			by the time she got there.</p>
		<p>"God that seems like a long time ago."</p>
		<p>"I know, Eddi; I miss Uncle John so much. You two were my second pair of parents.
			Now it's just you and me." she said as she grabbed onto her aunt's
			hand as they shared a mug of tea.</p>
		<p>"I swore that I would do anything to prevent that from
			happening again. I even hired a stable hand. Pretty nutty eh?"</p>
		<p>"What? That is not nutty, Eddi, you just want to be careful.
			I don't blame you at all. You can never be too careful, believe me. I don't
			think that I have felt so unnerved as I was the first time I drove somewhere
			after the accident."</p>
		<p>"God knows, honey, we have extra sets of eyes watching
			over us now."</p>
		<p>"Yeah we do. I can feel mom every once in awhile. I bet you can too."</p>
		<p>"Oh yes, Dear, my sister and I had a very close bond. I feel her around me almost
			every day. A part of me died that day..." Her voice trailed off as she felt
			emotions run through her body.</p>
		<p>Ally sensing the distress in her aunt, leaned over and
			hugged her. The two women hung onto each other until their sobs ceased.</p>
		<p>"Enough of this mushy stuff. You came here to be free
			of this sadness, and what do I do? I'm sorry hon."</p>
		<p>"Eddi, I came here to start over, I will never be free of that sorrow. It will
			just take some time to lessen that pain. I'm just going to take things
			day by day. That's all I can do right now."</p>
		<p>"You are right dear. Now, let's get you unpacked."</p>
		<p>"Ok, do I get my old room?"</p>
		<p>"Actually dear, I had to give you the guestroom. Syd is staying in your old
			room. I didn't think that I would ever get you here on a permanent basis,
			so I gave it away when I hired Syd."</p>
		<p>"Who is Syd, Eddi?"</p>
		<p>"Syd is my stable hand. I will introduce you two later on. Right now, let's
			turn that old guestroom into something to your liking. I started making it more
			homey than it used to be, but I am sure that you can put your own touches on
			it."</p>
		<p>"It'll be great, Eddi, thank you for everything."</p>
		<p>"Aww, honey, I would walk through fire for you, you know that."</p>
		<p>"I love you too."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The two continued unpacking Ally's room and before
			long it looked quite comfortable and the two just looked at each other and smiled.</p>
		<p>The color on the walls was a soft emerald, like Ally's
			eyes, and had many old pictures on the walls. Some of them her aunt had painted
			of landscapes and whatnot. There were framed photographs along the windowsills
			showing the history of Ally's life. Many were of her with her parents.
			Her favorite was the one of her with her mom and Eddi. They were sitting along
			the edge of the Grand Canyon. They both looked at that picture with such wonderful
			memories. The room was as done as Ally wanted it to be for the time. She would
			dig into the rest of the boxes later. She wanted to see her horse, Polka, before
			it got too dark.</p>
		<p>"Eddi, I am going out to see Polka, I'll be in later
			ok?"</p>
		<p>"She'll be happy to see you again. I know she loves you
			to ride her. Syd will be out there to help if you need any."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Eddi, I'll see you later."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The stable was as she remembered it. Two stalls for the
			horses and a loft that she and Jack used to play in when they were younger.
			She saw an older man tending to field with Matty, Edna's other horse.</p>
		<p>"That must be Syd. I'll go say "Hi" after I find
			Polka. I can't wait to ride her. Maybe it will take away some of this depression"
			she said to herself.</p>
		<p>She walked out into the corral where she expected to
			find Polka, but what she saw was nothing short of awesome.</p>
		<p>There she was, long black hair flowing through the wind
			as she rode Polka across the field. She was amazing. Ally's eyes could
			not break from the sight in front of her. The woman was wearing black jeans
			with a white shirt and black vest. Her body was slim and quite flexible as Ally
			was noticing as she flawlessly lead Polka through a number of jumps and a couple
			tricks in the saddle. She seemed a million miles away and as happy as one could
			be.</p>
		<p>Her focus finally cleared and her heart skipped a beat
			as this mystery woman approached closer to her.</p>
		<p>"Alicia, I presume."</p>
		<p>'God I never thought I would hear my name sound so incredible' she
			thought to herself about the woman's accent.</p>
		<p>"Hello? Anyone home?"</p>
		<p>"Um, I'm sorry. Yes I'm Ally. I see that I don't
			need to worry about Polka getting exercise while I'm away."</p>
		<p>"Nope. She is a great ride. Edna tells me she is yours. She is beautiful."</p>
		<p>"Yes she is. I miss her when I am away, but I guess that won't be a problem
			anymore."</p>
		<p>"I guess not."</p>
		<p>"Do you mind if I ride her? I haven't ridden her
			in ages."</p>
		<p>"Of course not. Just take it easy on her, we just did
			some drills and she may be a little tired. This heat doesn't help much
			either" she said as she wiped her forehead with her forearm. Ally couldn't
			help but to stare. This woman had the most beautiful blue eyes she had ever
			seen.</p>
		<p>"Are you alright?"</p>
		<p>"Ye....yeah I am fine. Sorry." </p>
		<p>The woman slid almost seductively down from the horse
			and rose to her full height next to Ally's smaller frame. She stood about
			6 feet tall and was all but angelic to Ally. She felt very safe standing next
			to this woman and felt a closeness that she didn't quite understand.</p>
		<p>"She's all yours."</p>
		<p>Ally mounted Polka and noticed that the stirrups needed
			to be adjusted before she found herself on the ground.</p>
		<p>"Could you give me a hand?"</p>
		<p>"Sure.." She reached under Ally's boot to raise
			the stirrup on the left side, then walked around to the other side. She raised
			the other stirrup and held Ally's calf as she led her foot into the stirrup.
			Ally felt a jolt of energy course through her body. She sat and waited for the
			surge to end and when she realized that it was over she turned to thank the
			woman, but she was gone.</p>
		<p>'Who is THAT? I didn't even get her name. My
			God she is gorgeous.'</p>
		<p>She shook her head of the thoughts raging through her
			mind and urged Polka into the field. </p>
		<p>Ally rode Polka and a part of her childhood returned
			to her. She felt more comfortable and secure at this moment than she had in
			the last two months. She still remembered that phone call the day her parents
			were killed. She was still at the University of Illinois. She had only one week
			left for finals when her Aunt Edna called. It wasn't unusual for her to
			call, but the circumstances were more than she was ready to bear.</p>

		<hr/>

		<i>
			<p>"Hi, Eddi! God I can't even tell you how crazed
				I am right now with finals. I have four tests in the next week. I have just
				about exhausted myself entirely. Thank God this will be over in a few days....."
				On the other end she could hear her aunt breathing heavy and knew then that
				there was something wrong.</p>
			<p>"Eddi, what's wrong?" She could hear sobs at this
				point and just waited to hear her aunt's voice.</p>
			<p>"Ally......"</p>
			<p>"Eddi, what is it?"</p>
			<p>"Ally....I don't know how to tell you this..."</p>
			<p>"Just tell me, whatever it is, I can take it." 'I hope,' she thought
				to herself.</p>
			<p>"Honey, it's your mom and dad..." was all that Ally
				heard. A wave of emotion crashed through her as her aunt told her that a drunk
				driver killed her parents the previous night. They were coming home from dinner,
				when a red Cadillac swerved into their lane causing them to drive over the median
				and into oncoming traffic. There was no hope for survival when the paramedics
				arrived.</p>
			<p>"Wait... slow down, Eddi... please..." she sobbed. "Are
				you telling me...that my parents... are dead?" All Ally could hear was her aunt
				crying on the other end of the phone. She knew then, that it was true.</p>
			<p>"Ally, I am so sorry. There are no words that I can say
				that can lessen this pain any. I will be in Chicago in a couple of days to take
				care of..... arrangements for my sister and her husband... I don't want
				you to have to worry about... anything. Oh Ally... I am so sorry."</p>
			<p>"Eddi, I don't think I could handle this coming from anyone else.......I
				will finish with finals........ and I'll be home." Her mask of strength
				was showing now. She had to be strong now......for someone.</p>
		</i>

		<hr/>

		<p>The sobs wracking through Ally's body were almost
			as strong as the ones she had at her parents' funeral. It was too difficult
			to try and understand why her parents were taken so horribly. She just needed
			to let it out and try to make the best of her life, her new life now, with her
			aunt. </p>
		<p>"Polka, I just can't believe that they are gone.
			They were taken way too soon." She nuzzled her horse and it seemed as though
			she knew what her owner was going through. She nuzzled her back and they shared
			a moment of solace.</p>
		<p>The sun was setting and Ally hadn't realized how
			long she had been outside. She walked Polka back into her stall and gave her
			a couple carrots. She said good-bye and made her way to the main house.</p>
		<p>"Eddi? I'm back," she called to her aunt.</p>
		<p>"In here, Dear. I was just about to send a search party
			out for you. You are just in time for dinner. Have a seat."</p>
		<p>"Let me go wash up, and I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>"Alright, darlin'."</p>
		<p>Ally came back from washing up and took her place next
			to her aunt.</p>
		<p>"Mm, dinner smells wonderful."</p>
		<p>"I can always count on you to compliment a meal, honey."</p>
		<p>"Hey, it's not my fault. I came by it honestly. I believe it was one of
			your traits that I developed."</p>
		<p>"Yes your mother and I were both cursed with healthy appetites. It is a good
			thing that you didn't develop the tummy that I have though," she said with
			a chuckle.</p>
		<p>"Don't think it won't happen. If I didn't
			work out, I would be right there with you. Besides, I like the way you look."</p>
		<p>"Dig in, it won't be that great if it gets cold."</p>
		<p>"I will, I just need to grab a glass of milk."</p>
		<p>"Don't get up, Syd is in the kitchen." </p>
		<p>Directing her request to the kitchen, "Hey, Syd? Could
			you bring a glass of milk with you dear?" She saw a glimpse of an OK sign coming
			from the kitchen.</p>
		<p>Ally took a bite of her food as her glass was placed
			in front of her. Not looking up she said, "Thank you, Syd."</p>
		<p>"You're welcome, Alicia," came the sultry response.</p>
		<p>Ally almost spit out what was in her mouth. "You're
			Syd?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, who were you expecting, Medusa?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, I guess I was just expecting a man....sorry. I know that name
			can go both ways, I just assumed. Please excuse my lame stereotyping."</p>
		<p>"You are forgiven." She smiled at the eagerness of her housemate's apologies.</p>
		<p>Ally could hardly eat the rest of her food. She could
			not believe the woman she saw earlier was the same woman her aunt referred to
			as her stable hand. 'My God!! I can't even untie my tongue to ask
			for some salt!'</p>
		<p>"Do you not like my cooking, Alicia?"</p>
		<p>"Um..no I umm.. it's very good. You cooked this?"</p>
		<p>"Mhhmmm, I have many skills."</p>
		<p>'Oh I can see that,' she thought to herself.</p>
		<p>"So, how long have you been working for Eddi?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I came aboard I think it was about 2 years ago. I came to the states
			about 6 years ago from Australia. My family had a sheep herding station there.
			My parents both passed away, and I sold the station to my older brother."</p>
		<p>"Why did you come to the states? Australia is a beautiful place."</p>
		<p>"Yes it is. I went to school there for a year and ended
			up in a relationship that brought me here. When that didn't work out, I
			heard from some friends that your aunt here was looking for some help. It wasn't
			sheep, but I knew alot about horses and stable work. I wanted to see what life
			might be like in the states, so I decided to stay. I love the work here, and
			Edna is wonderful lady."</p>
		<p>She ended her story just like that. When it appeared
			that no more of the story was going to be offered Ally chimed in.</p>
		<p>"Well it seems as though Eddi appreciates your work here.
			This ranch must seem pretty homey to you. Do you miss home?"</p>
		<p>"Sometimes, but like I said I like it here. Edna has been wonderful."</p>
		<p>Ally just studied the woman as she ate. She couldn't be much older than
			she, maybe 25 or so. Ally's appetite finally came back and she continued
			to eat everything on her plate, and what her aunt didn't eat.</p>
		<p>"I see it is a family trait," Syd chuckled.</p>
		<p>"You betcha!" Edna said with pride. "Anyone for some
			apple pie?"</p>
		<p>"None for me thanks," Syd replied.</p>
		<p>"Count me in Eddi. Do you have........?"</p>
		<p>"Whipped cream is coming too, don't you worry." She smiled at her niece
			and walked back into the kitchen.</p>
		<p>"So, umm, Syd. Is that short for Sydney?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, that is where I was born. I guess my parents liked the name."</p>
		<p>"It suits you."</p>
		<p>"Do you think so Alicia?" She smiled a very sexy smile at Ally.</p>
		<p>"You can call me Ally."</p>
		<p>"I don't think so. I rather like Alicia. It......suits you." She smiled
			at Ally.</p>
		<p>"Well I have never really been fond of my full name.
			It always meant that I was in trouble or something."</p>
		<p>"Well we will just have to fix that now, won't we Alicia?"</p>
		<p>Ally sat there with her mouth slightly open. She just didn't know what
			to think about Syd. There was something about her that she just couldn't
			let go of. There was a silent mystery that was building. She wanted to find
			out everything there was to know about her. 'But why?' Ally wondered.</p>
		<p>"Thank you for dinner Sydney, it was very good." Two
			can play at this game. Syd smiled at the younger girl's use of her full
			name. 'Do you know what kind of game that is being played here Alicia?
			I wonder...' Syd's thoughts rolled through her mind as Edna walked
			in with two plates of apple pie. </p>
		<p>Syd couldn't hold back a laugh at Ally's child-like
			expression as the dessert was placed in front of her.</p>
		<p>"Oooooo, Eddi this looks fabulous."</p>
		<p>"Dig in child."</p>
		<p>The rest of the meal was silent as Eddi and Ally ate
			their pie. Watching them eat this dessert was like watching Michelangelo paint
			the Vatican. Food, Syd was learning, was art to them. Never before had she seen
			two people 'oooh' and 'aaah' so much in her life. It made
			her smile in spite of it.</p>
		<p>"If you two ladies, will excuse me. I have to get the
			horses ready for the night."</p>
		<p>"Sure Syd, and thanks again for a wonderful meal."</p>
		<p>"You're welcome Edna. See you later Alicia."</p>
		<p>"Being that we live under the same roof, you can count on it."</p>
		<p>Syd beamed a large grin and left the room, leaving Ally just staring in her
			absence.</p>
		<p>"Ally? Is there something wrong?"</p>
		<p>"Eddi, God, why didn't you warn me about Syd? She is nothing that I imagined.
			I really thought that "Syd" was the older gentleman outside in the fields."</p>
		<p>"Why would I warn you about Syd, she is nothing to be
			afraid of Ally. I really like her. She has done a great job, and she is really
			good company. Quite a head turner too. I guess it would have saved you some
			embarrassment though eh?"</p>
		<p>"Exactly! She is very beautiful indeed. You would think that she would be doing
			something other than stable work though. Not that there is anything wrong with
			taking care of horses."</p>
		<p>"Alicia my goodness, since when do you have to be ugly to work in a stable?"</p>
		<p>"God Eddi, I didn't mean it like that. I mean Syd isn't just pretty,
			she is drop dead gorgeous! She could be a model or an actor, you know? I didn't
			mean anything by that."</p>
		<p>"I know you didn't child, hell you are quite the head turner yourself,
			and as I recall, we were just talking about how much you resemble my younger
			self. So no offense is taken dear." She nudged her niece as smiled.</p>
		<p>"I'm gonna head outside and breathe in this air
			that I have missed so much. Montana is a far cry from the Windy City. It is
			so peaceful and clean here. I'll see if I can help Syd with anything. That
			is, if she will accept any help from a city mouse like me."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure she will dear, go on now. I'll clean up here, don't
			you worry."</p>
		<p>"OK, Eddi, thanks for the pie, it was wonderful....and Eddi, thanks for bringing
			me here. I think I am going to love being here."</p>
		<p>"Bye now." Edna smiled at her niece. 'I do believe that something or someone,
			will make sure of that.' She mused to herself.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Need any help?"</p>
		<p>Ally crept up on Syd and unknowingly started her out of deep thought.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm sorry Syd, I can come back."</p>
		<p>"No, that's alright Alicia. I just didn't expect anyone to come out
			here. This is the part of the day that I love. Take a listen."</p>
		<p>Ally looked into the night's sky and listened, but didn't hear anything.</p>
		<p>"What are we listening for? I don't hear anything."</p>
		<p>"Exactly, all you hear are crickets, the wind, but that's about it. It is so
			quiet this time of night. Sometimes I just sit out here or up in the loft and
			overlook the field. This place does remind me of home. Well, minus the sheep
			of course."</p>
		<p>Ally sat and listened to Sydney speak. She felt intoxicated from her voice.
			It was so soothing but yet powerful all in the same tones. She didn't really
			notice that the taller woman had stopped talking, she just kept watch of her
			expressions.</p>
		<p>"I seem to keep pulling you from your own thoughts, do
			I make you uncomfortable?" Syd inquired.</p>
		<p>"No, I'm sorry, I just have a lot on my mind. I
			don't mean to be rude, I should just leave you alone."</p>
		<p>"Alicia, wait..." Syd slowly held Ally's arm. Both women felt the force
			of that touch.</p>
		<p>"Edna told me what happened to your parents. I am truly
			sorry. No one should lose anyone they love to an accident like that."</p>
		<p>Ally felt the tears brimming her eyes. "Thank you. I guess you may know what
			it's like to lose your parents."</p>
		<p>"Yes, but mine died of natural causes, and I didn't lose them both at once.
			You on the other hand, have been dealt a whole lot more than I."</p>
		<p>The two women just sat and studied each other in silence. Both feeling a strange
			closeness to the other, but neither willing to admit that.</p>
		<p>"So, um..." Ally started while wiping her tears away,
			when she felt Syd's touch wipe a tear from her cheek. "Is there, um, anything
			that I can help you with out here?"</p>
		<p>"That is sweet of you, but no, the horses have been watered and they are all
			set until 5 am."</p>
		<p>"My God that is early!"</p>
		<p>"Well, that's what your aunt pays me to do."</p>
		<p>"Do you like it here? I mean, you are all alone."</p>
		<p>"I like it very much. Alicia, I am not alone here. I have Edna, and now, I have
			you," she winked at Ally and started back to the house.</p>
		<p>Ally didn't quite know what to make of that last
			comment, but she was willing to bet, she meant that she had someone else under
			her roof now.</p>
		<p>"Sydney?" Ally called to her.</p>
		<p>"Yes Alicia?"</p>
		<p>"Thanks for listening, I mean letting me listen to nothing,
			I mean......."</p>
		<p>"You are welcome, Alicia. Shall we go in and see what kind of mischief your
			aunt is getting into?"</p>
		<p>"Sure." They smiled at each other and walked back up to the house.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Excellent, thanks Bill. I'll see you in a couple
			days. Bye."</p>
		<p>Edna hung up the phone as the two women walked into the family room. They plopped
			themselves onto the couch and waited for her to speak.</p>
		<p>"Well ladies, I'll be leaving tomorrow."</p>
		<p>"What? Where are you going Eddi? I just got here."</p>
		<p>"Oh honey I will only be gone a week or so. There is some new equipment for
			the stables that my friend Bill told me about. They are holding an auction in
			Indiana. If I want to update any of my old equipment I have to get there no
			later than tomorrow night. I got to get my name in the hat."</p>
		<p>"Ahh, I see."</p>
		<p>"Come up and help me pack?"</p>
		<p>Ally's face lit up and then she looked over to Syd. "You coming?"</p>
		<p>"No, I think I'll just head up to my room and read before bed."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure? You can probably get Eddi to tell one
			of her famous stories about my childhood. She loves to embarrass me."</p>
		<p>"How can I turn that down?"</p>
		<p>"Good, come on," she smiled and unconsciously grabbed
			Syd's hand and led her to the stairs. She let go of it at the bottom of
			the staircase, both feeling the loss of contact, quietly preceded up the stairs
			to Edna's room.</p>
		<p>Syd and Ally sat on Edna's bed and watched her rifle
			through her clothes to find the right ones to pack.</p>
		<p>"Mustn't look too trendy. Ranch owners should look
			rustic, don't you think?"</p>
		<p>Ally and Syd looked at each other and giggled.</p>
		<p>"Eddi just wear whatever you damn well want. Who cares
			what other people think. Life is too short. You gotta live life......."</p>
		<p>"Well, when did you become so philosophical?"</p>
		<p>"About six weeks ago..." her voice trailed off and she dropped her head down.</p>
		<p>Realizing what she said, Edna walked to the edge of the
			bed and put her hand on Ally's shoulder. "You'll make it through this
			little one. I will do whatever I can to make it easier for you."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Eddi, I didn't mean for that to sound like that. I know
			you didn't mean anything by that. I guess it's going to be a sore
			spot for a while."</p>
		<p>"It will, Alicia, but that only means how much your parents meant to you. That
			is not a bad thing. If it is of any comfort, whenever you need to talk, I'll
			be here for you."</p>
		<p>"Thanks Syd, that means alot to me."</p>
		<p>"Sure, anytime."</p>
		<p>"So, Syd, do you wanna hear about when Ally broke her
			leg falling out of the upstairs window?" Edna asked as she wiggled her eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"What?? I don't think I would miss this for anything."</p>
		<p>Ally quietly grumbled about the story that was about to start. Looking back
			now she can laugh about it, but at the time there was nothing funny about it.</p>

		<hr/>

		<i>
			<p>"Jack hurry up! We are going to get caught!"</p>
			<p>"Ally just keep quiet, mom is gonna hear you. Do you want to get out tonight
				or not?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah, but damn, can't we speed up the process?"</p>
			<p>"Well, "Miss-I-can-do-things-faster-than-anyone" if you would help me instead
				of yap at me, we could be finished already."</p>
			<p>Edna stared at the air vent leading up to her son's room. She heard voices
				that she assumed were Jack and her niece Ally. They were conspiring about something,
				but she was unsure what it was. She thought it would be a good idea to find
				out why they were still awake when it was past midnight.</p>
			<p>"There, I think it will hold." Jack said proudly of his
				handiwork.</p>
			<p>"It had better, otherwise you'll have to explain to Aunt Eddi what happened
				to me."</p>
			<p>"Ssshhh, tie this around you and I will lower you down."</p>
			<p>"Ok, but I am more than a little nervous about this."</p>
			<p>Jack had taken the liberty of taking all the linen off of his bed and tied the
				sheets together. The "rope" would get them out of the house and back into the
				house without waking anyone. Jack had some buddies that were going to meet up
				with him and Ally. Summer was the time to hang out and drink with your friends,
				and Ally being 13 , needed to learn just how cool summer could be. Her older
				cousin Jack, now 16, was just the guy that would teach her too.</p>
			<p>"OK, Ally, just sit on the edge of the window and I will
				start to lower you down."</p>
			<p>"Are you sure you can hold me, Jack?"</p>
			<p>"Come on Ally, you are just wasting time. We gotta go, now come on!"</p>
			<p>"Ok, Ok."</p>
			<p>Ally sat on her knees in the windowsill, she lowered herself so that she was
				holding herself up with just her hands. She felt the rope tighten around her
				and her body was slowly being lowered to the ground. She grabbed onto the rope
				and closed her eyes.</p>
			<p>Jack was easily lowering his cousin to the ground when
				I knock came to his door.</p>
			<p>Trying to sound sleepy he replied, "Who is it?"</p>
			<p>"It's your mother, who else do you think it is? Can I come in? I can't
				find Ally, is she in with you?"</p>
			<p>Sweat began to pour off of Jack as he decided what to
				do with the other end of his rope.</p>
			<p>"She's not in here mom."</p>
			<p>Edna opened the door and like a deer in the headlights, Jack froze in his place,
				except for one thing. He had let go of the rope causing Ally to fall the rest
				of the way down to the ground and breaking her leg.</p>
			<p>"Well I said she wasn't IN here." Jack coyly smiled
				at his mother who in turn pointed her finger at him and ran outside to tend
				to her niece.</p>
		</i>

		<hr/>

		<p>"It took over two months for my leg to heal." Ally remembering
			the pain, but laughing is spite of the memory.</p>
		<p>All the women were holding their bellies as the laughter ripped through them.</p>
		<p>"Oh I will never forget the look on Jack's face
			when I walked in! He never expected me to enter. Ha-ha!!! Oh my... I will never
			forget that as long as I live."</p>
		<p>"Me either..." Ally managed to get out through the laughter. The tears were
			rolling off of her face and she was grateful these tears were happy ones.</p>
		<p>"Oh my goodness, Alicia, you were a little spitfire weren't
			you? My folks would have beaten my ass if I'd tried to break curfew like that,"
			Syd chimed in.</p>
		<p>"She's still the same spitfire, so watch out Sydney!"
			Edna gave her a knowing look and Syd just smiled back at her.</p>
		<p>"Well I see a whole lot of packing NOT getting done here,
			so I guess I should concentrate on the task at hand."</p>
		<p>"My pride thanks you," Ally walked over to her aunt and kissed her cheek. "I
			think I am going to turn in. It's been a long day."</p>
		<p>"Welcome home, Ally. Sleep well little one," her aunt said.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Eddi. Good night, Syd."</p>
		<p>"Good night, Alicia. Good night, Edna," she said as she made her way down the
			hall and towards her room. She looked to the room next to hers and saw the light
			still on. She walked over to the doorway and peered in seeing Ally on her bed
			staring at a photo of her parents.</p>
		<p>"Knock knock. Do you mind if I come in?"</p>
		<p>"No, not at all. Please," she patted the bed next to her.</p>
		<p>Syd took a seat next to Ally. She looked over the younger
			woman's shoulder to look at the photograph.</p>
		<p>"You have your mother's eyes."</p>
		<p>Stifling a sob, "She was beautiful. God I can't believe that she is gone."</p>
		<p>"She isn't gone Alicia. She is with you everyday. With every breath you
			take, she is there watching over you. They both are. I truly believe that,"
			Syd consoled her new friend as she rubbed her back.</p>
		<p>Wiping her nose with a Kleenex, "I know it just hurts."</p>
		<p>"I know it does, but believe me, you are doing exactly
			what you need to do to let that hurt calm. If you didn't cry, and left
			it all inside, it would eat you up into nothing. Believe me, I learned that
			lesson the hard way."</p>
		<p>"If you don't mind me asking, how old were you when your parents passed
			away?"</p>
		<p>"I was thirteen when my dad passed away, and I was just
			about seventeen when my mom died. They left me the sheep station and I ran that
			until my brother showed an interest in buying it from me. I sold it to him and
			came here after schooling for a year."</p>
		<p>"How did you handle their deaths at such a young age?"</p>
		<p>"Well let's just say I became a very angry young girl. I got into a lot of trouble,
			hung out with the wrong people, the usual rebellion."</p>
		<p>"What snapped you out of it? When did you decide that you needed to change?"</p>
		<p>"It happened before I came to the states. I was involved in a relationship that
			turned bad. I had to change my life once and for all, just so I could feel again.
			I was dead for a long time."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. Were you in love?"</p>
		<p>"Let's just say what I thought was love at the time, turned into something
			very hateful and hurtful. I won't ever let myself feel for someone again.
			The loss is just too much."</p>
		<p>"You can't mean that. To deprive yourself of love just because of one incident
			when you were younger? That's silly!!"</p>
		<p>"I can't go through that again. Giving yourself
			wholly to one person is just making yourself too vulnerable. To let someone
			know every kink in what makes you you, gives them that much more to use against
			you."</p>
		<p>"Sydney, that is not love. Love is something so much more than that."</p>
		<p>"Are you an expert at such a young age?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not an expert, but I do know from watching my parents what love is.
			They loved each other so much, and anyone could see that, if they just watched
			them for a short period of time. And just a little FYI, I'll be twenty in a
			couple months." Ally said bitterly, more than expected.</p>
		<p>"Excuse me, you appear younger. I'm sorry to have
			been presumptuous. I believe you when you spoke of your parents' love.
			I can tell by your passionate description of them, that it must be true."</p>
		<p>"It is, well, it was. I'm sorry to have jumped into the defensive mode
			there."</p>
		<p>"It's completely understandable." Watching Ally yawn, she spoke up, "I guess
			I should let you rest."</p>
		<p>"I'm not really tired, but you have to get up early."</p>
		<p>"Will you be alright?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I'll be fine. I mean it's not my usual room, but I should be ok.
			Thanks for talking with me. It is nice to talk with someone that actually has
			an idea of what I am feeling."</p>
		<p>"You are welcome, Alicia. Anytime you need to talk, let me know. I'll be
			here for you."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Sydney. G'night mate." She teased in her
			best Australian accent.</p>
		<p>Sydney turned and chuckled, "G'night mate."</p>
		<p>Ally turned down her bedding and jumped inside the blankets.
			Tucking herself in she said a quiet prayer to her parents thanking them for
			giving her a home with Edna, and for Sydney. She closed her eyes and settled
			into a restless sleep.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Syd awoke to a new noise in the house. She checked her
			clock and it shined 2:37. 'Must have been something outside.' She
			thought to herself.</p>
		<p>She lay back down and tried to settle herself back into
			sleep. </p>
		<p>She heard the same noise again and decided that she wouldn't
			get any sleep without figuring out what the noise was. She put on a shirt and
			some shorts and made her way towards the hall. She opened the door to the hallway
			and heard the sound louder, this time she could place it. Ally was crying. She
			approached her door and quietly listened. Ally was having nightmares. She quietly
			knocked on the door to see if she would answer. No response happened except
			for the continuing sound of crying.</p>
		<p>Syd opened the door to find her suspicions were accurate.
			Ally was in her bed tossing and turning as she cried small sobs. </p>
		<p>"No... please... no." Ally cried in her sleep.</p>
		<p>Syd made her way to the bed and slowly started to stroke
			Ally's hair. The small cries ceased and her new friend appeared to be sleeping
			more peaceful than before. She moved off the bed and into the hallway. With
			another glance at the sleeping form, she closed the door and returned to her
			room.</p>
		<p>She stripped off her clothes and jumped back into bed.
			She welcomed sleep now that she knew that everything was alright.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Syd stirred in her sleep to smell a familiar yet foreign
			scent under her nose. She slowly opened her eyes to find a sleeping Ally in
			her arms. The clock shined 3:45, Ally must have walked in her sleep into the
			room she was familiar with. Syd enjoyed the feel of a warm body next to hers.
			It had been awhile since she shared a bed with anyone. Especially one as beautiful
			as Alicia. </p>
		<p>'I won't wake her, she needs sleep. Hopefully
			she won't be too embarrassed in the morning. If she knew that she spent
			the night in the arms of a naked woman, she might feel a little self-conscious,'
			Syd smiled as she thought to herself. She relished the feel of Ally in her arms,
			so yes, tomorrow indeed could wait. She closed her eyes and waited for the daylight
			to wake her.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally stretched out in her sleepy haze and yawned. She
			felt rested for the first time in several weeks. She slowly opened her eyes
			and to her surprise she found herself in her old room.</p>
		<p>"Oh my God! How did I get in here? Great, just great.
			I can't believe you, Ally. This is the stupidest thing you have done in
			a long time. Stupid... stupid..." She trailed off as she tripped her way out
			of Syd's room and back into her own. </p>
		<p>"Shit. Now how am I going to explain this one? I wonder
			if Eddi knows. Time to face the embarrassing music&#133; after a shower, I look
			like hell." She said as she looked into the mirror above her dresser.</p>
		<p>Ally bounded down the stairs to find her aunt reading
			the newspaper at the kitchen table.</p>
		<p>"Mornin' Eddi."</p>
		<p>"Almost good afternoon, Child. I was hoping to say good-bye before I left."</p>
		<p>"When is your flight?"</p>
		<p>"I have to leave in a half-hour. I left the name and number of the hotel I'll
			be staying at in Indy by the phone in the family room, if you need anything.
			You two girls should be fine. I bought plenty of food and Syd can take care
			of the animals."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Eddi. Is there anything I can do for you before you go?"</p>
		<p>"Promise me that you will behave yourself while I am
			gone."</p>
		<p>'She knows!!' her thoughts raced through her head while she thought
			of a reply.</p>
		<p>"Who me?" Ally choked out while smiling a nervous grin.</p>
		<p>"Ha! I know you better than you know yourself, just remember that. Just behave,"
			she chuckled at her niece's remark. 'Boy do I know you better than
			you know yourself. We'll just see what happens while I'm gone.'</p>
		<p>"Is that bacon I smell?"</p>
		<p>"That's my girl. We'll fill you out yet."</p>
		<p>"I think you're right. With all of this homecooking, I don't have a chance."</p>
		<p>"Come on, eat up. I'm gonna go out to see if Syd
			needs anything before I leave."</p>
		<p>"Like a doorlock?" Ally whispered to herself as she prepared a sandwich.</p>
		<p>"What, Hon?" Edna asked.</p>
		<p>"Nothing Eddi, I'm just hungry. I'll meet you outside."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Hon. See you."</p>
		<p>"Bye," Ally said as she took a mouthful of her bacon,
			lettuce, and tomato sandwich.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Finding Syd in the field with Polka, Edna signaled for
			her to come in. Syd saw the signal and made her way towards the stable.</p>
		<p>"Hey there, Edna, what can I do for you?"</p>
		<p>"It's what I can do for you, Syd."</p>
		<p>"Hmm?" she shook her head at Edna not understanding what she meant.</p>
		<p>"I just came out here to see if there was anything that
			you wanted before I left on my trip."</p>
		<p>"Oh, thanks, but I think that I have everything that I want."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure you do. OK then I will be back in about a week. As I told Ally,
			I left the number to the hotel next to the phone in the family room, should
			you girls need anything."</p>
		<p>"I think we'll be fine, but thanks again for asking.
			Have a safe trip Edna."</p>
		<p>"Syd there is one thing I would like you to do for me."</p>
		<p>"Name it."</p>
		<p>"Please keep an eye on Ally. I thought I heard her crying last night."</p>
		<p>"I will, Edna, I promise. She will be in good hands while you are away."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, I'm sure she will be," Edna gave her
			a devilish smile and walked towards the main house.</p>
		<p>"Now what did she mean by that?" Syd questioned.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Back inside Ally was washing off her plate as her aunt
			walked into the house.</p>
		<p>"Well it looks as if everything is in order here. I am
			off to Indiana. Take care my dear. I will be home in about a week."</p>
		<p>"Don't worry about me Eddi, I'll be fine," Ally replied in earnest.</p>
		<p>"I know, Dear, just try to get yourself situated and
			make this your home."</p>
		<p>"You have made that very simple Eddi, thank you. I think
			I will tackle the rest of my boxes today. Have a safe trip okay?"</p>
		<p>"Will do, Honey. Come here."</p>
		<p>Edna pulled Ally in close for a hug. Ally needed to know that she was loved
			and that she would be missed.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Syd was in the stable tending to Matty and Polka when
			Ally walked in.</p>
		<p>"Hey there, Syd." Trying to smile away her nervousness.</p>
		<p>"So the little sleepwalker awakens."</p>
		<p>'Oh shit,' Ally thought. "Never one to pull a punch, eh Sydney?"</p>
		<p>"Not when pride is on the line. Besides, no harm, no foul. Don't worry
			about it. It was kind of nice to share a bed again. Maybe it has been too long
			since I shared myself with someone."</p>
		<p>"Well good, glad I could help&#133;I think."</p>
		<p>"Your talk with me last night got me thinking. Maybe I was too young when all
			of my emotions were playing with me," Syd stopped what she was doing to look
			into Ally's eyes. "Maybe I should try and give my heart to someone. Maybe...I
			still don't know."</p>
		<p>"Well just make sure that they are deserving of it. Don't waste your time
			otherwise. If someone was to hurt you, I can't promise that I wouldn't
			do some damage to them."</p>
		<p>"Oh, Alicia, I didn't know you cared," she drawled out sarcastically.</p>
		<p>"You made me care, Syd. You showed me enough of yourself
			in the last day or so, to know that your heart is gold. I just couldn't
			stand to see someone walk over it without feeling."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Alicia that means alot to me."</p>
		<p>"You're welcome, Sydney," she really liked the way
			that name dripped off her lips.</p>
		<p>"What do you have planned for today?"</p>
		<p>"I think I am going to tackle the rest of my boxes this
			afternoon. The sooner I get settled in, the sooner I will feel more at home.
			I hate living out of my suitcases."</p>
		<p>"That sounds like a good idea. Shall I leave Polka out of the stalls for you?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, please. I would love a ride later on. Maybe you could ride Matty and come
			with me."</p>
		<p>"I'd like that. I'll see you later."</p>
		<p>"Alright Syd, see you."</p>
		<p>Ally turned to walk towards the house and felt Syd's eyes on her back.
			She turned around to see if her curiosity had been right and found the warmest
			set of eyes looking right back at her. She felt her stomach creep into her throat
			and managed a smile back towards Sydney. She returned the smile and went back
			to her work.</p>
		<p>Ally went back into the house and started up the stairs.
			She walked past Sydney's room and a blush crept up her neck as the memories
			of where she woke up came back to her. She shook off those feelings and went
			to the task at hand.</p>
		<p>There were four boxes staring at her. She stared right
			back at them and finally gave in.</p>
		<p>"Alright, let's get this over with," she said to
			the inanimate objects.</p>
		<p>An hour passed by and Ally sat staring at her last box
			as her boom box blared out some old Prince tunes. </p>
		<p>'The beautiful ones you always seem to lose.'</p>
		<p>"Isn't that the truth," she said to the CD player.</p>
		<p>'Do you want him, or do you want me? Cuz I want
			you! I said I want you!!' </p>
		<p>Ally started screeching out the lust-filled lyrics as
			Sydney just watched and smiled to herself. </p>
		<p>"Baby baby baby, I want you! Yes I do!" Ally was totally
			getting into the ending of the song when she felt eyes on her once again. </p>
		<p>She turned around to see Sydney just giggling in the
			doorway.</p>
		<p>"OH MY GOD!!! Don't do that!"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry Alicia, I didn't mean to frighten you. I just didn't
			want to interrupt. I figured this was better than singing along with you and
			really freaking you out," Syd tried to explain between her laughing fits.</p>
		<p>"It's ok. I just need to breathe. Let me turn this down," Ally turned down
			the volume and made her way to the doorway.</p>
		<p>"Well are you going to lurk in my doorway all day or
			do you want to come in?"</p>
		<p>"Well actually, I was going to see what you wanted for
			dinner."</p>
		<p>"Dinner? Is it that late already?"</p>
		<p>"No, it's not, but I need to prepare for it."</p>
		<p>"Wow, Syd, you don't need to cook for me. I can just whip something up."</p>
		<p>"That scares me. You whipping something up, that is."</p>
		<p>"I can cook, I'll have you know."</p>
		<p>"Well that may be true, but tonight I was planning some spaghetti if you are
			game."</p>
		<p>"Ooh that sounds great. Do you need help?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, you can show up at the table at around six. I put
			Polka and Matty back in for now. Maybe we can get that ride after dinner. So,
			I'll see you in about two hours. Cool?"</p>
		<p>"Cool. Thanks. And Syd?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"I am sorry about coming into your room last night. I must have just gone there
			out of habit."</p>
		<p>"Don't worry about it Ally. It was nice. See you later."</p>
		<p>"Ok, see you."</p>
		<p>'Nice? Wow, definitely not the answer I thought
			she would give. Maybe she is.....no way. The way she looks, she could have anyone
			she wanted. Why would she look twice at me. Way too much baggage,' Ally
			argued to herself.</p>
		<p>Ally finished putting away the last of her things as
			she checked the clock, it showed 5:30. </p>
		<p>"Good, I have a half hour to clean up and head downstairs
			for chow," Ally said as she made her way into the bathroom.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The stove was eliciting smells that were wafting up the
			stairs. Ally's nose discovered the smells instantly. Her stomach chimed
			in soon after and she made her way down the stairs to see if there was anything
			she could do to help with dinner.</p>
		<p>The sight she found took her breath away. The table was
			dressed with candles ready to be ignited and the fresh flowers in the vase were
			a really nice touch she thought. 'Boy it's almost like a "date",'
			she giggled to herself. </p>
		<p>The wine was being chilled off to the side of the dishes
			and her maitre d' was still standing at the stove watching the sauce simmer.</p>
		<p>"Syd?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, Alicia, I didn't hear you come in. You startled me."</p>
		<p>"Yeah well, paybacks are a bitch. And believe me, I still owe you after the
			singing thing."</p>
		<p>"Ooh I love a challenge. Sit down, dinner is just about ready."</p>
		<p>Ally smiled and took her seat at the table watching Syd's form in the kitchen
			taking ladles full of the sauce into a bowl and setting it down on the table.
			She watched Syd walk back into the kitchen and opened the oven and took out
			what appeared to be garlic bread. She grabbed the baking sheet and accidentally
			touched a part of it without her potholders.</p>
		<p>"Shit! Ow!! I can't believe I did that."</p>
		<p>Ally was out of her chair and immediately ran cold water from the faucet. She
			took hold of Sydney's finger and let the cold water run over her burned
			skin.</p>
		<p>"Thanks," Syd said as she looked into loving eyes.</p>
		<p>"You're welcome." Ally replied as she took Syd's
			finger and began to blow onto the injured digit.</p>
		<p>Syd just watched this woman do what came so naturally
			to her. 'God, would you take care of me like this forever?' She thought
			to herself. Ally looked into her eyes as she was blowing on Syd's finger
			and a jolt of desire washed over her. She seemed to hear the question floating
			through Syd's mind. The bond that was forming was something that both women
			were accepting with open arms. The closeness that they felt was so natural that
			trying to fight it, was useless, and extremely futile.</p>
		<p>"Better?" Ally asked sincerely.</p>
		<p>"Much, thank you. You have such a warm touch. Very nurturing,
			thank you."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, one of the many traits my mom passed down to me."</p>
		<p>"Remind me to say a prayer of thanks to her."</p>
		<p>"You just did."</p>
		<p>"I guess so. They say when the living think of the dead, the dead can hear their
			thoughts. Maybe they are right."</p>
		<p>"I think so. Are you well enough to eat?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely, have a seat. The pasta and sauce are on the table. I'll get
			the bread, and I'll be right in."</p>
		<p>"Oh no, I see what happens to you when you handle bread. I'll get it. You
			go sit down. You've done all the cooking, the least I can do is bring in
			the bread."</p>
		<p>"You win, I'll go sit."</p>
		<p>Ally put the bread into the basket that Syd had prepared, and made her way to
			the table.</p>
		<p>"Syd, this is so nice of you. The table looks wonderful.
			If I didn't know better, I would think that you were trying to wine and
			dine me."</p>
		<p>"Heaven forbid." She smiled innocently. "Glad you like it. I just wanted it
			to feel cozy for you. You know, like home."</p>
		<p>"Thanks Syd, that is sweet."</p>
		<p>The two ate in relative silence. The only sounds were coming from the stereo
			in the other room. Pachelbel's Canon and other baroque music was coming
			from the speakers. Ally's ears picked up the music and she complimented
			Syd's choice of dining music.</p>
		<p>"I really love this music. Great choice."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, I have always loved Baroque music. I am glad you agree."</p>
		<p>"I love Pachelbel, especially the music from the Rhapsody on a Theme from Paganini.
			I absolutely love that piece. You know they used that in the movie 'Somewhere
			in Time'?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I love that movie!! God, I can't tell you how many times I have seen
			that film. It is about soulmates finding each other after a lifetime. God it
			breaks my heart and heals it all in the same motion. I'm just glad the
			ending was the way it was, I don't think I would have liked it otherwise."</p>
		<p>"I totally agree!! I still watch it when I am feeling down."</p>
		<p>"Why? Doesn't it add to your depression?"</p>
		<p>"Not really, because the way I look at it, as bad as things are, God, I couldn't
			imagine the other half of my soul coming into my life, and then having to watch
			them disappear into nothing. They had it much worse than me, so I guess it makes
			me look at my problems from a different viewpoint. It's just not that bad,
			you know? You can't take things so seriously."</p>
		<p>"Wow, that is something to think about."</p>
		<p>"I wonder if Eddi has that film. I would love to watch it with someone that
			loved it as much as I do."</p>
		<p>"Well if she does, count me in. I'm a sucker for that film."</p>
		<p>"Note to self: Find 'Somewhere in Time'," Ally said as she winked
			at Sydney.</p>
		<p>They giggled as they finished their dinner and the entire
			bottle of wine. Soft conversation mixed with the wine and dinner was a perfect
			mixture for a perfect meal.</p>
		<p>"Thanks Sydney, this was wonderful."</p>
		<p>"My pleasure. I enjoyed your company. I like you Alicia, I am glad that you
			came here to stay."</p>
		<p>"I like you too Sydney. I had the best meal and conversation I have had in a
			very long time. Thank you."</p>
		<p>Syd smiled and started to clear the table. Ally stood and began helping with
			the chore.</p>
		<p>"How about you dry while I wash?" Ally said to Sydney.</p>
		<p>"Sure, thanks."</p>
		<p>Ally handed dishes to Syd who was just watching Ally's hands in the soapy
			water. Her mind filled with desirable thoughts involving Ally and a hot tub.
			She mentally kicked herself as she dropped one of the plates handed to her.</p>
		<p>"Hello?? Earth to Sydney? Where were you?"</p>
		<p>"That might be a better question for later." She said with a devilish smile.</p>
		<p>"Uh oh, I smell trouble."</p>
		<p>"Nothing but the best, coming from me," Syd said as she cracked the towel against
			Ally's butt.</p>
		<p>"Hey! You better cut that out or you'll be in for
			a fight you won't win!"</p>
		<p>"Oooooohh, I sense another challenge. Come and get me Alicia, if you can catch
			me!" she said as she cracked the towel and landing it with a 'thwack'
			against Ally's thigh.</p>
		<p>"You are a dead woman!! You had better run, cuz when
			I catch up with you, you are gonna wish you didn't start this!!" Ally yelled
			at the retreating form. She picked up the pieces of the broken dish, thankfully
			it broke cleanly into two parts. She grabbed a towel and dipped it into the
			water. 'She is gonna be sorry she waged war with me,' she smiled evilly
			to herself as her body became alert to the hunt that was on.</p>
		<p>"Come out, come out wherever you are!" she teased.</p>
		<p>"Aliiiiiiiciiiiiaaaaaaaaa, come and get meeeeee." Syd
			taunted back at her.</p>
		<p>'She is toast." Ally laughed as she looked behind
			the door leading to the living room. She slowly walked over to the stereo and
			turned off the music. Syd smiled inwardly at Ally's attempt to track her.</p>
		<p>Syd tried to move quietly from room to room following
			Ally at a safe distance behind the younger woman. She decided that play time
			was about to begin. She quickened her pace so she was just a few feet away from
			Ally, when she was surprised by Ally turning suddenly and lashing the towel
			at her. Unfortunately for Syd it landed squarely on her upper thigh towards
			her behind.</p>
		<p>"Ow!!"</p>
		<p>"I told you, I will not lose this fight! I grew up with Jack in this house,
			and we spent a good majority of our childhood doing just this," Ally laughed
			out.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah? I had an older brother too, missy."</p>
		<p>Syd whipped her towel only to have Ally grab it in mid air. </p>
		<p>"Ha! I told you. You may be older, but I have more experience
			with this type of warfare. Do you give or do I need to teach you another lesson?"</p>
		<p>"More experience huh? How much experience? I bet Jack didn't teach you
			this..." Syd said as she grabbed Ally's body and playfully tossed her to
			the floor pinning her arms above her head.</p>
		<p>Ally just looked into Syd's eyes and found the home
			she had been looking for all of her life. She just continued to stare as Sydney's
			expression changed from playfulness to something more fervent. Ally wanted this
			badly, but Sydney overwhelmed with emotion, let her go and retreated into the
			other room without another word.</p>
		<p>"Sydney?" Ally's voice chased after her. She got
			up and went after Sydney.</p>
		<p>"Hey. Are you alright?" Ally said as she gently touched
			Sydney's arm.</p>
		<p>"Please don't," was all Syd could muster.</p>
		<p>"Did I do something wrong?"</p>
		<p>"No Alicia, it's nothing you did. I think I need to go outside for awhile. Please
			excuse me," Syd said as if asking permission. Ally stepped aside and let her
			go. She watched as the door closed and wondered what had happened that she missed.
			'Did she pick up on my feelings? Great, maybe she isn't attracted
			to me. Maybe she doesn't like me like that. Damn I would have bet money
			after the dinner she prepared. God, I can't believe that I am having these
			feelings. I have never looked at another woman this way, and now that I have,
			it has gotten me into trouble. Shit!! God what she must think of me!' She
			scolded herself for not thinking about Syd's feelings. She contemplated
			going after her, but resisted the temptation.</p>
		<p>"If she wanted you out there, she would have invited
			you to come initially. Stay put missy," smiling at the name she used on herself.
			"Nope can't do that." she fought with herself and lost. Before she knew
			it she was outside looking for Sydney.</p>
		<p>Ally walked into the stable only to find Matty and Polka
			looking at her in wonder.</p>
		<p>"Hi girls, you seen a tall beautiful brunette in here
			tonight?" she asked the horses only to get no reply. Well, she got some chewing
			of carrots that she fed them, but that was all. "Great, if I was out here and
			not wanting to be found, where would I go?" Ally looked around and decided that
			the loft would be a sure shot. It was rather dark up there so she walked back
			to the house and found an old lantern.</p>
		<p>She took the lantern and headed back towards the stable.
			She lit the lantern and slowly crept up the ladder to the loft. Sitting with
			her legs draped over the edge of the window was her runaway.</p>
		<p>"Do I need a secret handshake or can anyone play up here?"
			Ally said trying to lighten the mood.</p>
		<p>"Sure come on over. Look at this sky, it is just remarkable."
			Ally walked over to the window and watched the remainder of color leave the
			sky.</p>
		<p>"Wow, I forgot how beautiful things were up here. I don't
			get colors like that in Chicago. There is alot, actually, that I didn't
			get in Chicago." Ally thought that Sydney might catch the subtle hint thrown
			in her direction.</p>
		<p>"Alicia, I am sorry for earlier, I don't know what
			came over me."</p>
		<p>"What do you mean? We were just having some fun. No harm, no foul, to quote
			a friend of mine." Ally said as she nudged Syd hoping to make her smile.</p>
		<p>"You really amaze me Alicia." Ally took in the woman's
			words with a questioning stare.</p>
		<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
		<p>"I mean most women that I have encountered would have just let me sit out here
			and dwell on about what almost happened tonight." </p>
		<p>"So I wasn't wrong about those feelings, you feel
			them too." it was more of a statement then a question.</p>
		<p>"Yes I do. I just don't know what to do about them.
			Ally did you know that I was attracted to women?"</p>
		<p>"No I didn't. I just felt an overwhelming attraction to you and a familiarity
			that was only getting stronger. Syd I know we just met, but I swear that I have
			known you all of my life."</p>
		<p>"Alicia, I will not deny my attraction to you, but I also told you how afraid
			I am of giving myself to anyone. I know its something that I need to do, I just
			don't know if I can do it yet. Please forgive me."</p>
		<p>"There is nothing to forgive Sydney. I am sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable
			in any way. Friends?" Ally said as she held out her hand to be shaken.</p>
		<p>Syd looked up at Ally's gesture and stood. She gently
			pulled the smaller woman into her arms. Ally graciously went into them like
			a moth to a flame. 'Home, I am definitely home,' was all that was
			going through the minds of both women. The embrace was so warm and so gentle
			that neither woman wanted to be the one the end the contact. The caresses and
			the closeness came to an end when Ally felt Syd's body stiffen.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong Sydney? Talk to me."</p>
		<p>"I need to know something."</p>
		<p>"Anything." Ally felt Syd's stare down to her core. Whatever she needed
			to know, Ally knew that the truth would be the only way to answer that question.</p>
		<p>"I... need to know..." Sydney's voice trailed off
			as Ally watched her face come closer and closer until all she could feel was
			Sydney's breath against her mouth.</p>
		<p>"Ask me Sydney..." Ally almost pleaded with her taller
			companion.</p>
		<p>"Kiss me... Alicia... please... I need to know..." Sydney's
			heart was racing with anticipation.</p>
		<p>Sydney almost didn't finish her statement as she
			felt the softest lips touch hers for the first time. The kiss was so gentle
			and soft she could have stayed there forever. Ally never felt the kiss of another
			woman. She never expected the softness she received from Sydney. It was incredible.
			The two women sunk deeper into the kiss, and only when Sydney pulled away did
			it end.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Alicia, I don't mean to tease you
			like this. It isn't fair of me. I just needed to know. I couldn't
			go through the thinking and the not knowing what your lips felt like on mine."</p>
		<p>Feeling a little hurt by her admission, "And what did
			I feel like? Did I fulfill your curiosity? Is that all that was? A need for
			knowledge? Well know this. I will not be played with, either you want this or
			you don't. I don't think I can handle any mind games right now, okay?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Alicia, I didn't mean to hurt you."</p>
		<p>"That's always the case isn't it? Good night, Sydney." Ally spun on her
			heel, climbed down the ladder, and headed back to the house. </p>
		<p>"Well that went well," Syd just sat there feeling horrible
			and stared into the night sky.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally didn't realize what time it was, she just ran
			into her room and slammed the door and locked it. It was only around 9:00. She
			wasn't tired she just needed to get away from Sydney. She laid on her bed
			with her face pressed into her pillow and just cried. She cried for what could
			have been, she cried for the loss of her parents, but most of all she cried
			for the friendship that would suffer the biggest blow.</p>
		<p>"Why... why do I feel so much for her? I just met her
			for God sake. God why does this always have to be so friggin' difficult?"
			she trailed off as the sobs turned to weeping. The weeping soon ended and her
			emotionally exhausted body finally let sleep claim her. </p>
		<p>Ally awoke to find her lights on as well as her clothing.
			Sleep clouded her sight momentarily then she rubbed her eyes to try and focus
			on her room. "The guest room. She even has my room." She scanned her room looking
			at the progress she had made earlier, and only then did she notice a small piece
			of paper sticking from under her door.</p>
		<p>She crept off her bed to examine the note. It was from
			Sydney.</p>

		<hr/>

		<i>
			<p>Dearest Alicia,</p>
			<p>How can I fully apologize for putting you through what
				I did this evening? I mean how could you not pick up on my attraction to you.
				I mean, look at the dinner we shared. It could have easily been a date. You
				hit the nail on the head when you suggested that I was trying to wine and dine
				you. Alicia, I don't know if I can remember having such a wonderful time
				as I did with you tonight. You are a beautiful woman and if you let me get to
				know you better, my fears may leave me. I know I don't deserve such a chance,
				but I am asking you as humbly as I can to please find it in your heart to forgive
				me.</p>
			<p>It's been so long since I have known the warmth
				of affection that I guess I freaked out. What I guess I am trying to say, is
				that I am sorry. I'm sorry for using you, essentially that is what I did.
				I did nothing less than that. I feel awful for the fact that you trusted me
				and I completely let you down. I tried to have my cake and eat it too, I guess.
				I shouldn't have played with your emotions like I did. You admitted your
				feelings to me and that couldn't have been an easy thing for you. I mean,
				I don't know much about your past, but I am willing to bet that you have
				never kissed a woman before. I probably scared that notion from your head as
				well, and for that, again, I am sorry.</p>
			<p>I would love to try and start over, if there is the slightest
				chance that this may happen I will accept any punishment you deem fit for my
				behavior. I was wrong for treating you like that and I am sorry. It's no
				wonder that I haven't been with anyone for so long, it's probably
				a good thing for them.</p>
			<p>Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am for what
				I did. If you want to talk about it later, just come in my room, I'm sure
				I will be up.</p>
			<p>With much regret,</p>
			<p>Sydney</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>'Well what do you know?' she thought to herself,
			'Maybe we can salvage a friendship after all.'</p>
		<p>Ally unlocked her door and made her way towards the light
			coming from her old room. She peeked in the doorway and saw such a heartwarming
			sight. Sydney had fallen asleep with her arms around a stuffed panda. Her eyes
			had salt marks on them, telling Ally that she cried herself to sleep. Ally's
			heart once again reached out towards the older woman. She walked in to pull
			the covers over her friend when Sydney stirred slightly and whispered, "Thank
			you." And gave Ally's arm a warm caress.</p>
		<p>"We'll talk tomorrow. Sleep now." Ally said as she
			kissed the top of Syd's head and shut out her light. She slowly turned
			to close the door and the blue eyes of Sydney watching her with disbelief caught
			her own eyes.</p>
		<p>"What is it Syd?"</p>
		<p>"Your kindness, you just amaze me is all. Even after what I did, you still came
			and tucked me in. I don't deserve you."</p>
		<p>"No one knows what I deserve, except for me. Try and get some sleep and we'll
			talk in the morning. Jack should be home tomorrow, at least I think that is
			what his message said."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Alicia, thank you. G'night mate."</p>
		<p>Chuckling at their little inside joke she replied in her best Aussie accent,
			"G'night mate." she whispered back and quietly closed the door after receiving
			a wink and smile from Sydney.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally woke up around 10 o'clock and in her own bed.
			She was very thankful that her subconscious didn't betray her. She made
			her way to the bathroom and grabbed her toothbrush and jumped into the shower.</p>
		<p>'The beautiful ones you always seem to lose'
			Prince chimed through her head again and reminded her of the conversation ahead.</p>
		<p>"God why does everything need to be so goddamned complicated?
			All I ask is that I get a good friend out of this. Syd seems like she is a good
			person. I don't get any bad vibes from her. Well other than she likes to
			tease me mercilessly. I could see myself getting quite attached really. I just
			need to channel my desire for her into our friendship, I can do that. I have
			no choice... " she said to her mirrored reflection.</p>
		<p>Ally opened the bathroom door only to have her nostrils
			flare with hunger at the delicious smells coming from the kitchen.</p>
		<p>'God does she always cook like this?' Ally
			mused to herself.</p>
		<p>She went into her room and put on some clothes. She raked
			a comb through her long locks and headed downstairs. Much to her surprise Syd
			was nowhere to be found, instead she found Jack seated at the table with one
			of his friends.</p>
		<p>"Jack!! You made it!"</p>
		<p>"Hey Squirt! Wow look at you, you have grown up beautifully Ally." Jack said
			as she dove in for a hug. "I guess the squirt thing still applies though, huh?"
			she jabbed him in the gut at his dig at her height.</p>
		<p>"I'm not a squirt, I am vertically challenged. I'm
			sorry, you must think we are terribly rude, I am Alicia, Ally for short." she
			said as she turned her head to notice the handsome face smiling at her.</p>
		<p>Standing to his full height, Peter outstretched his hand.
			"Hi, I'm Peter, Pete for short."</p>
		<p>"Short? I think not." Ally said as she noticed his tall muscular build in front
			of her.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I get that alot. Once I reached six foot two,
			my dad said he would disown me if I didn't play basketball."</p>
		<p>"And....?"</p>
		<p>"I sucked at basketball and he forgave me."</p>
		<p>"Mighty nice of him. Who is responsible for the incredible aromas wafting through
			this house? It can't be Jack, I have never seen him pick up anything close
			to resembling a pan." Jack raised his brow at his cousin and she immediately
			was taken off guard, "No way! You can cook now too? It has been a long time."</p>
		<p>"Yes it has Squirt, what has it been like 4 years?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah something crazy like that. How have you been, Cous'? I was so sad
			to hear about Aunt Donna and Uncle Tom. I was in the Orient when I got the news,
			I'm sorry I didn't make it to the funeral."</p>
		<p>"It's alright, Jack, I totally understand. It was so unexpected, but I
			know you were here in spirit, and I did receive your flowers and card. Thank
			you by the way. It helped more than you know."</p>
		<p>"Sure, Squirt, I just wish there was something more that I could have done."</p>
		<p>"You did plenty thanks for caring."</p>
		<p>"I would do just about anything for you Ally, you were
			the sister I never had."</p>
		<p>"Right back atcha, Jack. I never knew how lonely life was until the only family
			I knew, was taken away from me. I sometimes wonder if it would have been different
			if I had any siblings, you know? Would I be the person that I am now, that kind
			of stuff. Oh my... listen to me ramble on. Pete, I am so sorry."</p>
		<p>"Please don't apologize, you had something horrible happen in your life,
			far be it for me to tell you not to talk about it in my presence."</p>
		<p>"Jack, have I told you that you have great taste in friends?" Ally looked directly
			at Pete as she finished her statement of fact.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, at least this time you didn't have to break
			your leg to meet them."</p>
		<p>"What?" Pete asked not getting the joke.</p>
		<p>"Long story, ask my mom when she gets back." Jack laughed
			at Peter.</p>
		<p>"Make sure that I am far away when she tells that story
			again. I already had to sit through it as she told it in front of Syd." </p>
		<p>"Oh so you've met Syd, what do you think of her?
			I think she is great. What a looker she is too."</p>
		<p>"Christ, Jack, you sound so much like your mother."</p>
		<p>"And that's a bad thing, why?"</p>
		<p>"No, not at all, just making an observation."</p>
		<p>"Ah, so are you hungry, Squirt, I think I made a little too much breakfast.
			You think you can help me out?"</p>
		<p>"You do remember who you are talking to right?" she gave him an evil stare and
			grabbed a plate from the table and ran into the kitchen for some grub.</p>
		<p>Ally loaded her plate with eggs and bacon and bagels
			with jelly. She grabbed a glass of orange juice for good measure and made her
			way back to the table. Peter just watched in awe as this tiny woman packed a
			meal fit for an army into her small frame.</p>
		<p>"Where do you put it?"</p>
		<p>"In here." she laughed as she patted her full tummy.</p>
		<p>"Would have fooled me. You look like you eat like a bird."</p>
		<p>"See looks can be deceiving. Don't always trust your eyes, you might see
			things that aren't there."</p>
		<p>"I'll try and remember that." Peter responded with a hint of a grin.</p>
		<p>"Good, so how long are you here for?" she asked while
			staring at his deep brown eyes.</p>
		<p>"Only till the end of the week. Jack and I are partners, and we both have to
			head back to Phoenix to finish up our latest deal. They gave us a week to play
			while they made up their minds about our offer."</p>
		<p>"You tycoons, what will I do with the lot of you?"</p>
		<p>Jack and Peter just shrugged and chuckled as they made
			their way to the stable. Syd was out there brushing down Matty when she spotted
			the trio coming towards her.</p>
		<p>"Morning, Alicia." Sydney greeted.</p>
		<p>"Mornin', Sydney. Jack is home. Have you met Peter,
			Jack's partner?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, Peter has been here before. We chatted awhile when you were asleep."</p>
		<p>"Ah, sorry."</p>
		<p>"No worries. How did you sleep?"</p>
		<p>"Like a baby. I didn't seem to wander last night either, so it was a bonus
			when I woke up in my own bed this morning."</p>
		<p>"I can imagine it was quite a relief." she smiled despite the disappointment
			she felt. She was almost hoping that she would have stumbled back into her room
			again. It would have been nice to have held her as she slept.</p>
		<p>"Well, I would have hated interrupting your sleep again."
			Syd nodded at her reply and continued brushing down Matty. </p>
		<p>"So how did you sleep? Were you able to fall asleep after
			I left?" she was genuinely concerned.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I did finally. It gave me a chance to really think
			about what happened last night. I figured out... " she was cut off by Jack jumping
			into their conversation.</p>
		<p>"So what's up girls? Hey Ally, Pete wants a lesson.
			You think you can give him some fine points on riding?"</p>
		<p>"Um, sure, Jack. I would love to." she smiled at Jack's retreating form.
			Turning back to Sydney, "We will finish our conversation later. I promise."
			She stroked Syd's arm and took Matty's bridle and lead her into the
			stable.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally walked into the stable as Pete was marveling the
			size of Polka.</p>
		<p>"Alright Pete, here is your first lesson, ready?" she
			smiled.</p>
		<p>"You know, I have never stood next to a horse before,
			damn they are a big animal."</p>
		<p>"How else could they hold us silly boy?" she teased.</p>
		<p>"Yeah well, I was just saying. It's just weird seeing
			them so close."</p>
		<p>"Alright, put your foot in the stirrup and climb aboard
			Matty. She is very gentle, so don't worry." she reassured him.</p>
		<p>Peter did as instructed and found the other stirrup and
			put his foot into it.</p>
		<p>"Ok, step one hold the reigns at all times. If you want
			to turn left, pull slightly towards the left and she will turn. Same as for
			the right." she instructed as she climbed onto Polka.</p>
		<p>"Ok, now what about walking, running, and whatnot?"</p>
		<p>"Ok, to get her moving, just squeeze your legs around her belly. Like this..."
			she demonstrated the action with Polka. He did as she said and they were slowly
			making their way out to the fields.</p>
		<p>"Ok, now if you want to speed things up, just squeeze
			your legs a couple times and she will start to quicken her pace." she showed
			him her movements as she nudged her legs against Polka a few times until they
			were off into a slow canter. Pete did the same and caught up to Ally.</p>
		<p>"Ok, my biggest question. How do you stop?"</p>
		<p>Giggling, "Just pull on the reigns, but not too hard, you don't want to
			hurt her mouth. Let's go out there for awhile, there is a beautiful pond
			down there I haven't seen since I was a kid. I will lead the way so don't
			worry."</p>
		<p>"Lead on!" he nudged his legs against Matty and they were off.</p>
		<p>Sydney just watched as the two figures disappeared from
			sight.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Jack crept up on Syd and spooked her.</p>
		<p>"Hey there!! Anything I can help you with?"</p>
		<p>"Jesus, Jack!! You scared the shit out of me!!"</p>
		<p>Laughing, "I'm sorry Syd, you just looked kind of out there. Are you alright?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I am fine. You want to help you say?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, I need to do something. Pete and Ally won't be back for a bit and
			I'm sure you could use the help."</p>
		<p>"Well, since you were kind enough to scare me to death, you could help me shovel
			out the stalls." she smiled evilly as she handed him a shovel.</p>
		<p>"Me and my big mouth."</p>
		<p>"You said it, not me."</p>
		<p>The two headed back into the stalls and began their glamorous chore.</p>
		<p>"Man, I haven't seen Ally in so long, by God she
			has grown up nicely. She is beautiful."</p>
		<p>"Yes she is." Syd said not wanting to elaborate on the incredible lithe body
			that Ally had, or the intoxicating fragrance her body elicited, or the way her
			eyes made her heart melt, or especially the feel of her lips.......</p>
		<p>"Syd? Syd?" Jack said snapping his fingers in front of
			her face.</p>
		<p>"Wh...what? Did you say something?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I asked you how Ally had seemed to you. Is she doing alright?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, sorry. Well, her first night here she did some crying in her sleep but
			I think with a little help from her family and friends, she will be fine. I
			have to say considering the cards she has been dealt, she is doing incredibly
			well. I don't think I would be as together as she is. She is an incredible
			young woman."</p>
		<p>"Yes, she is. I think Pete thinks so too. I couldn't shut him up in the
			stables. God it's like school again, him asking me to ask her for a riding
			lesson. Jeez, how old are we?" he chuckled to himself, Syd was not amused.</p>
		<p>"So, how long are you home for?" wanting to end Pete's
			stay here.</p>
		<p>"Well it depends on the firm we are waiting on. We have
			an offer on the table, and as soon as they make a decision, we have to go back
			to Phoenix to either pick up the pieces, or sign contracts and such."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I see. Well let's just hope that it works out for everybody." She
			was including herself into that equation.</p>
		<p>"Yes, let's." he replied.</p>
		<p>Syd watched as Jack cleaned most of the stalls and headed
			back towards the corral. They looked out into the fields and saw Ally and Peter
			walking their horses back from their ride. They seemed very relaxed and were
			laughing and talking as they entered the corral.</p>
		<p>"Hi kids!" Pete shouted to them.</p>
		<p>"Hey there." Jack replied. "How was your ride?"</p>
		<p>"It was gorgeous! Ally took us down to the old pond behind those trees, you
			been there Jack?" Pete said as he was pointing towards the direction of the
			pond.</p>
		<p>"Of course I have dumbass, I lived here, remember? I think I got laid for the
			first time down there. Hey Ally, remember we went down there with some of my
			friends and just drank ourselves into oblivion."</p>
		<p>"Ah, the good old days." she said rolling her eyes, remembering the lecture
			she got from her aunt and uncle about responsibility.</p>
		<p>"Seems to me you brought me there to play spin the bottle
			with your buds cuz one of them made a bet with you that he would kiss me."</p>
		<p>"Haha that's right! Steve I think it was. Man, that was a lifetime ago.
			Any bottles down there today Ally?? Hmmm?" He said while wiggling his eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"God, Jack!" She said as she felt a blush creeping up
			her neck as she peeked over at Peter's smiling face.</p>
		<p>"Well if that's not a guilty smile I don't
			know what is." Jack replied.</p>
		<p>"For your information there were NO bottles where we
			were!!" she defended hoping to clean the grimace off of Sydney's face.</p>
		<p>When she couldn't handle the frustration anymore
			Syd made excuses to leave and walked towards the tool shed. Ally eyed her closely
			to see if she was angry. She couldn't pin point the emotion tugging on
			Syd's face. </p>
		<p>'Is she jealous?' she thought to herself. The
			thought of Sydney jealous of Peter made her smile inwardly. 'This boy doesn't
			hold a candle to you, my blue eyed Aussie.' she looked up at Jack and Peter
			who were still talking about Jack's good ole days at the pond. She rolled
			her eyes at them and they finally realized that maybe this should be talked
			about in different company.</p>
		<p>"Men." she said almost in disgust. "Don't you think
			about anything else?"</p>
		<p>When no answer was offered she shook her head and just glared at them. "Well?
			I am waiting for an answer."</p>
		<p>The two guys just looked at each other and just smiled at Ally.</p>
		<p>"Oh nevermind." she laughed with them.</p>
		<p>"Hey Jack we should probably check our email to see what's
			going on in Phoenix." Pete chimed in.</p>
		<p>"Yeah , I guess you're right. We'll be back
			later." Jack said.</p>
		<p>"Ok boys, see you later on. Don't work too hard."
			Ally teased.</p>
		<p>"Hey Ally, thanks for the lesson, I had a wonderful time. Perhaps we can do
			that again before I leave."</p>
		<p>"Sure Pete, anytime."</p>
		<p>Pete leaned over and kissed her cheek. She smiled a shy smile and turned to
			go find Syd when her eyes locked with the raven-haired woman. Ally smiled at
			her. When she got no response she approached her.</p>
		<p>"Hey."</p>
		<p>"Hey yourself."</p>
		<p>"What's wrong? Is there something bothering you?"</p>
		<p>"No, not at all? Is Romeo staying for dinner?" she asked sarcastically.</p>
		<p>"Romeo? Oh you mean Peter? Sydney, my God, are you jealous?"</p>
		<p>"And what if I am?"</p>
		<p>"Then I think you need to rethink our relationship. I thought you said that
			you couldn't have this yet. Which means that I am free to do as I please."</p>
		<p>"Well if you like that sort of thing, by all means, have at it." Syd said bitterly
			as she walked off in a huff back into the shed. Ally wasn't going to have
			this conversation end like that so she followed her into the shed. As she walked
			in Syd was holding her side in pain.</p>
		<p>"Syd? What is it? You look like someone stabbed you or
			something."</p>
		<p>"I jabbed my ribs earlier when I was fixing the front gate. I must have bruised
			them. I guess shoveling out the stalls wasn't the smartest of chores to
			do today."</p>
		<p>"Let me see." Ally said sincerely as she tugged on Syd's shirt.</p>
		<p>"Oh sure, now you want to see me naked." she laughed
			as the pain shot up her side.</p>
		<p>"I'm serious, Sydney! Come on, lift up your shirt." she commanded gently.</p>
		<p>Ally let out a startled gasp. "Oh my God Sydney. We should
			have you looked at."</p>
		<p>"You are looking at it right now." she teased back.</p>
		<p>Ally gently touched the bruised area and felt Sydney
			flinch at her touch. She watched as the muscles contracted down Sydney's
			strong abdomen.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry did that hurt?" she felt horrible.</p>
		<p>"No, it didn't, you tickled me. Come on doc, just kiss it and make it better.
			It's not that bad." she joked.</p>
		<p>Ally not wanting to disappoint her patient, thought she
			would see how far she could take this. She gently touched the area again and
			felt her body moving closer to Sydney's. She closed her eyes and gently
			kissed the bruise under Sydney's ribcage. Sydney's eyes widened with
			surprise. A tingling sensation ran through her body.</p>
		<p>"Oh Alicia, please. You don't know what you are
			doing to me."</p>
		<p>Ally kissed her again and let her tongue slowly circle the injured area. She
			wanted to devour every inch of this incredible woman. She needed her so badly.
			Her heart was screaming inside, beating so fast and so full. She felt Syd's
			body reacting to the stimulation.</p>
		<p>"Oh... please... Alicia... please..." Ally not hearing
			her pleas, wandered with her kisses and started blazing a trail over her stomach.
			Sydney grabbed Ally's head and pulled her into a heated, passionate kiss.
			Ally felt her soul grasping at her other half. Their tongues entwined in a powerful
			dance of desire. Unquenchable passion was surging through them when Sydney's
			defenses came back to haunt her again. </p>
		<p>Sydney pulled away holding Ally's head in her hands.
			"I... I can't do this. I'm so sorry, Alicia." she whispered her name
			as the tears raced down her face. She tugged her shirt back down and ran out
			of the shed leaving Ally alone with her head shaking from side to side not understanding
			what just happened.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally found Jack and Pete in the family room talking between
			themselves when she entered the house. They noticed her entrance and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Well, Squirt, it looks like we have fly out tonight.
			There seems to be a mix-up in our contacts that we have to clear up. So unfortunately
			our visit will be cut short." Jack sadly.</p>
		<p>"Oh no, Jack. I'm so sorry that you have to leave.
			What time is your flight?" </p>
		<p>"We gotta head out in about an hour or so to leave for
			the airport. I will be back in a couple weeks though, I promise. Mom would have
			my head if I didn't come and spend some time with her as well. I know she
			was getting pretty lonely out here, but when Syd came along, I think she really
			came out of her funk. I am so glad that you will be here for her too. I know
			she was really excited that you took her up on her offer."</p>
		<p>"You know, Jack, after mom and dad died, I didn't know my ass from a hole
			in the ground. When Eddi talked to me at their funeral and let me know where
			my home could be, I knew I had someplace special to go. I wouldn't leave
			her now for anything. Although, it would be nice to actually spend time with
			her now that I am here." she said sarcastically.</p>
		<p>"When is she getting back?"</p>
		<p>"She said in a week or so, so I shouldn't be alone long, don't worry."</p>
		<p>"I'm not worried Ally, you have Syd here, and you seem to like her so...
			"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I do, she is very nice. I like her alot. I'm glad Eddi found her."
			she said while wondering where Syd had run off to.</p>
		<p>"Alright you, Pete and I have some stuff we have to take
			care of before we go, so if you'll excuse us, we have to become boring
			again." he said ruffling her hair.</p>
		<p>"Alright, hey did you guys see Syd? I thought she came
			in here." she tried to be nonchalant with her question.</p>
		<p>"Umm... I think I saw her go upstairs a little while
			ago." Pete chimed in.</p>
		<p>"Ok, thanks guys. I'll see you before you head out."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Squirt." Jack smiled at his cousin.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally walked up the stairs and headed towards her room.
			She noticed Syd's door closed and decided to keep walking. She just didn't
			get her. 'Why would she come on to me like that if she didn't feel
			something? I will not play these games anymore, it's just too damn confusing.
			Next time, if there is a next time, I will wait for her to make the first move.'
			she said as she walked into her room and jumped on her bed.</p>
		<p>She cleaned up her clothes that were on the floor and
			made her bed. She tried to keep herself busy so she wouldn't think about
			Syd in the next room. Thoughts flooded to her mind from this afternoon. The
			softness of the kiss they shared. The power in the lips she was being kissed
			by. The desire that was building in her center was overwhelming. She shook her
			head of those thoughts, well, at least she tried to. </p>
		<p>Ally decided that there was no more cleaning that could
			be done at the moment and wandered over to Syd's room. She hesitated, then
			knocked on the door.</p>
		<p>"Syd?" she waited patiently for a reply..........Nothing.</p>
		<p>She knocked again and slowly opened the door. She looked
			in to find Syd asleep with the same panda tucked under her arms. The sight made
			Ally's heart swell, but she knew this time to keep her distance. She quietly
			turned around and closed her door. 'I'm still mad at you Sydney. I
			may have pushed a little too much today, but I don't think I deserved that.'
			Ally walked down the stairs to see if Jack and Pete needed a ride to the airport.</p>
		<p>"That's ok, Squirt, I called a cab. They should
			be here any minute."</p>
		<p>Pete walked up to Ally and held out his hand. "It was a pleasure meeting you
			Ally. I hope to see you again sometime."</p>
		<p>"Aw thanks, Pete, I hope so too. Maybe we can get that encore lesson the next
			time you come up." she reached up and hugged Peter around his neck and he kissed
			her cheek as she pulled away. "Such the gentleman." she smiled.</p>
		<p>"Who? Him? I think we need to talk, Ally." Jack said
			as Pete elbowed him in the gut. The cab driver announced his arrival with a
			honk of his horn.</p>
		<p>"Hey!! You are ruining my rep with your cousin here man!"
			Pete joked.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry, your reputation will be left unscathed,
			I promise." she reassured her departing guest. "Call me when you get to Phoenix,
			so I know you made it safe and sound, Ok?"</p>
		<p>"Of course, Squirt, I promise." Jack said as he knew the depth of her request.
			He leaned down and hugged Ally as they said their good-byes.</p>
		<p>"Bye!!" Ally shouted at them as the car drove away. She
			waved her last good-bye and closed the front door.</p>
		<p>It was close to dinner time and Syd still hadn't
			come down. "I guess I'll take a look at the horses to make sure they are
			fed and watered."</p>
		<p>She walked outside and took to her chores without hesitation.
			It looked like it may storm tonight, so she made sure everyone was inside for
			the night. It was kind of nice taking care of Matty and Polka. It reminded her
			of her childhood summers spent here with her family. Her aunt and uncle taught
			her how to care for the horses and she loved every minute she had with them,
			especially Polka.</p>
		<p>Ally's stomach reminded her that she still needed
			to eat dinner. She double checked the windows and doors in case of a storm,
			and headed back to the house. 'I'm sure Syd is awake by now. I'll
			see what she wants to do for dinner.' she thought to herself.</p>
		<p>She walked into the house to find it still quiet. She
			checked the family room and Syd was no where to be found. She poked her head
			into the kitchen and noticed that nothing had moved in there either. That could
			only mean that Syd was still asleep.</p>
		<p>"I guess I'll see if she wants dinner at all." she
			said as she walked up the stairs. As she reached the top of the stairs she heard
			the shower running. </p>
		<p>"Well at least she is awake now. I'll just wait
			for her to come out and see if she wants to eat. That is if she even wants to
			see me. Hell I should be the one that is angry, she walked away AGAIN, and here
			I am. God, I must be stupid.......or whipped, one of the two." she spoke softly.
			'My money is on the latter.' her mind chimed in. "Thanks alot, you're
			a big help." she walked into her room, turned on her CD Player, and waited for
			Syd to return from her shower.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Syd awoke from her nap more refreshed than she expected.
			Her ribs were hurting less than before, so for that, she was grateful. Her mind
			wandered back to the tool shed where she experienced the most incredible feeling
			she had ever felt. Her body ached for that contact again. She could feel the
			moisture building between her legs. Her eyes welled with tears longing to love
			Ally the way she wanted to be loved. Something kept her at a distance and she
			didn't know what. She knew her other half was outside right at this moment,
			but fear of hurt, rejection, and commitment, stopped her from finding her. She
			wiped the tears from her eyes and cursed the throbbing in her core. Her body
			knew what she needed, but she was too stubborn to accept it.</p>
		<p>'There's more than one way to skin a cat.'
			she mused as she headed off to the shower.</p>
		<p>The water beat down on her body as she let her emotions
			leave one by one. The tears returned and she welcomed the cleansing. Maybe this
			way, she would clear herself of whatever it was that was keeping her from her
			destiny. The tears slowed and she became more aware of her desire for Ally.
			Their kiss this afternoon was incredible. The feel of this woman's lips
			and tongue on her torso was orgasmic. The loss that she felt without her touch,
			was continual. As she reminisced about their meeting this afternoon, she found
			her hand roaming down her soapy body to fulfill a need that was overwhelming.
			Small, slow circles turned into fast, hard exploration. She braced her body
			against the wall of the shower as she released her frustration and longing in
			a matter of moments. Her thoughts of Ally were endless. How it was her that
			she wanted to feel loving her body. As her breathing came back to normal, she
			rinsed her shampooed hair, and washed the soapy water down the drain. </p>
		<p>She stepped out of the shower to hear the faint sound
			of music. She felt her heartrate increase as she knew that Ally was only a room
			away. 'God, I wonder if she heard me. Oh well, nothing I can do about it
			now. If she knows, she knows.' she looked at her reflection through the
			steam on the mirror. "You can do this Sydney. You know this is right. Just let
			it go. Be happy for once in your life." she reprimanded herself. She continued
			to dry off and geared up for another encounter with Ally. Being that they lived
			under the same roof, she knew if was inevitable.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally heard the shower turn off and a smile crept to the
			corners of her mouth. She knew that Syd would have to talk to her, and maybe
			after her shower, she would like to do it over dinner. This time, no physical
			contact.</p>
		<p>The bathroom door opened and Syd walked out in her robe
			and long wet hair dangling off to one side. Ally walked out into the hall and
			gasped an audible gulp as she saw the sight in front of her. 'My God she
			is beautiful.' Was all she could think.</p>
		<p>"Hello, Alicia." She managed to get out.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Syd. Um, I know you probably don't want to
			see me right now, but I was wondering if you wanted to do anything for dinner.
			I mean its no big deal, but if you wanted, I could cook something, or we could
			order something out." she rambled through her nervousness.</p>
		<p>"Well, actually I am kind of hungry. I do have to go
			out and tend to my duties, since I kind of abandoned my job this afternoon."</p>
		<p>"Oh, don't worry about that. I took care of it for you." she said proudly.</p>
		<p>"You did?" she said in almost a whisper. She couldn't
			believe this woman in front of her. 'I am a fool.' she decided in
			her mind. "Thank you Alicia. That was very nice of you. And very unexpected,
			you didn't have to do that."</p>
		<p>"I know, I just figured, well... It was kind of my fault what happened today,
			and I do feel kinda bad for what I did."</p>
		<p>'Now she is APOLOGIZING for what I DID.' her eyebrows rose into her
			forehead as she listened to Ally take her blame from her.</p>
		<p>"Wait a minute Alicia. What happened today was NOT your
			fault. Know that right now."</p>
		<p>"Syd..." Ally tried to get a word in... as usual.</p>
		<p>"No Alicia, I shouldn't have responded the way I
			did. Ok, maybe you coaxed me a little, but I shouldn't have run out on
			you again. It was very childish of me and I am sorry." the words came out faster
			than she could stop them.</p>
		<p>"It's understandable. I know your position on this,
			and I pushed, so for that, I too am sorry."</p>
		<p>The two seemed to come to an understanding, but that
			still left dinner plans up in the air. Syd told Ally to wait for her in the
			family room. She would get dressed and come down shortly. Ally agreed and made
			her way down the stairs. Syd closed the door to her room and leaned against
			the door while exhaling a sigh.</p>
		<p>"She is too much. I have to do something before I lose
			this one for good. Take a deep breath Sydney, you will be just fine." she coached
			herself.</p>
		<p>She grabbed a pair of jeans and a baby blue polo shirt.
			Her eyes locked with the ones in her mirror and she decided that tonight she
			would make the biggest decision of her life. That scared the shit out of her,
			but it was now or never. She knew Ally wouldn't wait forever. She took
			a deep breath, and made her way down to the family room, to meet with her dinner
			guest.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Ally waited patiently on the sofa for Syd to return.
			She was nervously chewing the inside of her cheek. She didn't know what
			to expect from this woman. 'On one hand she was incredibly beautiful, sexy,
			an amazing kisser, and oozed sensuality. On the other hand, she is the most
			frustrating woman that I have ever met. I don't think that I have ever
			been as sexually crazed as I have been in the last two days.' she mused
			to herself. </p>
		<p>Shaking her head clear of her thoughts, she noticed that
			Syd was making her way down the stairs. She was smiling at Ally as she entered
			the family room.</p>
		<p>"Hey there." she greeted.</p>
		<p>"Hey yourself." she retorted.</p>
		<p>"Have you decided anything for dinner? Or did you want
			some input?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I really was waiting for you, before I made a
			final decision."</p>
		<p>"Well, I had a thought. Are you game enough to trust me?" she asked through
			a raised eyebrow.</p>
		<p>"Well given our track record, I 'm not sure I feel
			comfortable answering that question."</p>
		<p>"Alicia, I know that I have given you no reason to trust me in any way, but
			I truly think that you will enjoy my idea."</p>
		<p>"And if I don't?"</p>
		<p>"Then you can tar and feather me if you like." she oozed with sarcasm.</p>
		<p>"Well, how can I pass up an offer like that?"</p>
		<p>"Good, give me a few minutes to prepare something, and I'll meet you in
			the stable."</p>
		<p>"In the stable? Syd it looks like its going to storm."</p>
		<p>"All the better, Alicia. I will show you what living in the country is all about,
			my little city mouse."</p>
		<p>"Your little city mouse? Are we getting a little possessive 'my little country
			mouse'"?</p>
		<p>"Well, let's just say that I have gotten used to
			having you around." she nudged Ally as she walked into the kitchen.</p>
		<p>"Alright, Sydney, I'll meet you there, but if I
			hate whatever you have planned, don't think that I won't keep you
			to your word."</p>
		<p>"Ha!! I don't doubt that!!!!!" she yelled from the kitchen.</p>
		<p>Ally smiled and wondered what she was up to. She turned
			and went outside to meet Syd at the stable. "I don't like this one bit.
			Just look at this sky, we are going to get soaked. She had better not be jerking
			me around this time. I swear to everything Holy that I will kick her square....
			in...." Ally paused to gasp in surprise at Sydney's arrival.</p>
		<p>Syd was carrying a large picnic basket and a blanket
			in her arms.</p>
		<p>"Are you game? I thought it would be nice to ride out
			to that pond that has everyone oooing and ahhing and have our dinner out there.
			What do you think?"</p>
		<p>"I think we are going to get drenched." she crossed her arms and started tapping
			her foot on the ground.</p>
		<p>"Alicia, I have seen you eat. We won't be out there
			long enough for the rain to even think about hitting us. Come on, it will be
			fun. We can take Matty and Polka. If it does rain there is plenty of canopy
			out there under those trees. Will you have dinner with me Alicia?" she asked
			showing Ally her puppy dog baby blues.</p>
		<p>"Oh my God, you are SO not fair. Let's go Miss "I-Can-Get-Anything-I-Want-With-A-Bat-Of-My-Eye"
			Syd laughed at her as she walked towards the stalls.</p>
		<p>Syd climbed on Matty and took the basket from Ally. She
			in turn gave the blanket to Ally and then coaxed the horses out towards the
			field. The ride was quiet as both women contemplated conversation. They wanted
			to talk about the feelings that they had for each other, but were unsure where
			that would lead. Settling for a quiet ride worked for them both.</p>
		<p>Ally led Syd to the pond and Syd couldn't believe
			that she had never made it down here before.</p>
		<p>"This is absolutely beautiful, Alicia. I can't believe
			I never found this place. I could have filled so many nights here. You can get
			lost by looking at this landscape. I can see why you spent time here." Syd said
			in awe.</p>
		<p>"Mm I know. I spent alot of my summer nights here. I
			would just sit at the edge of the water and just think. I would write sometimes
			or just veg out. I love it here. Over there, by that large rock, is where the
			'infamous' game of spin the bottle happened."</p>
		<p>Syd smiled at her memory and wondered what Ally was like when she was a teenager.</p>
		<p>"I bet you had a ton of boyfriends when you were in high school, no?"</p>
		<p>"Actually, no. I was kind of a loner in high school.
			A geek for lack of a better word. I had a few close friends, but I pretty much
			kept to myself. I would cut loose when I came out here though. I guess I felt
			much more comfortable here than with the people in my school. People are really
			hard in Chicago. They aren't the nicest of people. It's really hard
			to admit that too, since I have lived there pretty much my whole life. People
			are really hard hearted so to speak. I just see such a difference in people
			out here. Much more willing to help out others, and that kind of thing. God,
			I am rambling, I am sorry." she apologized.</p>
		<p>"Oh please don't apologize. I love listening to
			you talk. I bet you tell a great story. You have such a cute accent."</p>
		<p>"
			<i>I</i> have an accent? You are the one from 'down unda'!" she kidded
			her Australian friend.
		</p>
		<p>"Yeah well, to me you have as much of an accent as I
			have to you."</p>
		<p>"Well I guess looking at it like that, it's true. This is great Syd. You
			are right; this was a good idea. Thank you."</p>
		<p>"It's the least I can do, Alicia. I feel really bad about this afternoon.
			I shouldn't have left you like that. I am sorry."</p>
		<p>"Syd, that is in the past now. Let's just start over and enjoy what we
			have now, ok?"</p>
		<p>"All right. Let's eat. I didn't really have too much to work with,
			so I got some sandwiches together and some salad. I thought the wine would be
			a nice touch as well."</p>
		<p>"You thought right. This is really great."</p>
		<p>"I'm glad you like it."</p>
		<p>The two ate in comfortable silence, occasionally looking
			into each other's eyes and smiling. Syd's mind was racing; time was
			running out as the sky turned darker with the storm's approach. They ate
			on the blanket-covered ground and lay back watching the cloud movement with
			wineglasses in hand.</p>
		<p>"Do you ever wonder what comes after life Syd? I mean,
			what do you think happens to us after we die?"</p>
		<p>"I think about it every once in awhile actually. If there wasn't life after
			death, don't you think that this would all be a waste? I really believe
			that in living this life, we learn, our souls learn that is. We take all of
			that knowledge with us through our lives. After we die, our soul takes on another
			form and we start a new life, but with the same soul. Have you ever heard of
			people referring to others as being an old soul?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I have. Is that what they are meaning by that. Someone that has had a
			few lives with the same soul?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I personally think that is what they mean by that. I mean there is such
			a huge world out here. We couldn't possibly cover it all in one lifetime.
			I think we are given a chance to explore it all, but not necessarily as the
			same physical presence. Now, don't laugh at me, cuz I really believe this."</p>
		<p>"Ok, I promise not to laugh."</p>
		<p>"I really think that you and I were lovers in a past life."</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"I mean it, Alicia. I have only known you a few days, literally. But I also
			feel closer to you than I have anyone in my life, well outside of my family.
			I don't understand it, but I don't want to fight it anymore either.
			Alicia, after my childish tantrum this afternoon, I finally decided to stop
			being immature about my feelings. I need to look at the person who is willing
			to give me her heart, and know that she won't take mine and break it. That
			person is you Alicia; I want to give you my heart. I know I have no right to
			ask that of you, but I want you to have it, that is, if you still want it."</p>
		<p>Ally's mouth went dry; she couldn't believe what she was hearing.
			Her heart wanted to believe what Syd was saying, but her mind kept thinking
			it was too good to be true. She downed the last of the wine, dropped her glass
			in the basket, and turned to leave. She ran to Polka and mounted her ride back
			to the stable. With a last look at Syd's dumbfounded face, she urged Polka
			back to the house. Syd grabbed the picnic items, jumped onto Matty, and chased
			after her heart. She chased Ally back to the stables and saw her heading back
			towards the house. She led Matty into the stable and ran after Ally. Ally turned
			around when she heard urgent footsteps behind her. She saw Sydney running towards
			her and decided to face her fears once and for all.</p>
		<p>"Sydney, I really want to believe you, but I just can't
			play these games anymore. I have tried twice, unsuccessfully I might add, to
			show you I could love you, but you ran. Who is to say that you won't do
			that to me again? I have way too much going on in my life right now. I just
			can't handle anymore heartache. I'm sorry, I just can't set myself
			up for that again." she said as the tears started to well in her eyes. She started
			to walk away as the rain started to fall. </p>
		<p>Syd reached out in desperation to stop Ally from walking
			away from her. She leaned forward catching Ally's arm. Ally turned around
			and fell to one knee.</p>
		<p>"Alicia, please..."</p>
		<p>Crying, she pleaded, "Dammit, Sydney, I can't do
			this. Please, just let me go."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Alicia, I can't do that." she pulled herself closer to
			Ally and held her face in her hands. She wiped away the raindrops that were
			falling against her cheeks as she leaned forward to meet the lips she so desperately
			wanted to feel again.</p>
		<p>Ally's mind was racing with confusion. Her body,
			feeling the heat that was building inside, released a moan as the contact deepened.
			Syd gently sucked on Ally's bottom lip and felt soft hands stroking her
			face. Ally was crying, but her tears were filled with an extreme happiness that
			consumed her entire being. The kiss was very tender and was filled with gentle
			strokes of their exploring tongues, tasting every ounce that they were willing
			to share. Unwilling to break the contact, Syd gently lay Ally down on the wet
			grass and continued their passionate baptism. The rain started coming down harder,
			but Syd and Ally were oblivious to it all. Syd moved her kisses down Ally's
			neck and shoulder. Nipping and biting as she made her way down her soon-to-be
			lover's body, Syd heard Ally's sounds of desire and want.</p>
		<p>"What do you want, Alicia?" She purred into Ally's
			ear causing a shockwave of electricity to shoot between her legs.</p>
		<p>"You, Sydney, I want you, please. I need you to touch
			me, feel me, taste me, you inside of me, I want it all."</p>
		<p>"And you will have it Alicia, I promise." she swore,
			"I will give you everything that I am and more."</p>
		<p>The two women lay on the wet ground ignoring the weather and relishing the feel
			of the other's body. Slowly Syd raised Ally's shirt over her head
			and gently removed her bra. She knelt in front of Ally and pulled off her own
			shirt to reveal herself to her new lover. Ally just watched in awe as this woman
			continued to prove once again that she was absolutely beautiful in every way.
		</p>
		<p>Their bodies slowly moved with the rhythm of their breathing.
			Syd kneaded the round, fullness of Ally's breasts, gently rubbing her thumbs
			over the nipples. Ally's back arched in response and knew that she needed
			more. Syd lowered her head to capture one of the nipples in her mouth. Slowly
			circling her nipple with her tongue, Syd made sure that Ally knew the depths
			of her desires. Syd brought Ally's breast almost completely into her mouth
			and felt Ally's hand pulling her head closer.</p>
		<p>"God, Sydney, you feel so incredible. Uhngh" Ally moaned
			as her head slowly rocked from side to side.</p>
		<p>The rain slowly poured on their almost naked forms, as
			the rest of their clothing was tossed to the side. Ally grabbed Sydney's
			butt and slowly massaged the muscles moving above her. Syd's body was grinding
			into Ally's center and the passion that was building, was almost blinding.
			The feel of Ally's naked skin against hers was the most amazing thing Syd
			had ever experienced. Ally's body responded to Syd's every touch,
			every kiss, every breath exhaled against it. She wanted Ally more than she wanted
			anything in her life before. She gently moved her hand down to Ally's lower
			abdomen and kissed the skin beneath her fingers. Ally and Syd locked eyes knowing
			the act that was about to play out. </p>
		<p>Sydney adjusted her body between Ally's legs and
			took a deep breath. She inhaled the sensual scent coming from Ally and wanted
			nothing more than to lose herself there. Ally grabbed handfuls of grass as Syd's
			tongue gently touched her clitoris. A surge of desire poured out of her and
			into Sydney with one touch of Syd's tongue. </p>
		<p>"Oh my God, Ally, you taste incredible." she whispered
			to Ally as she briefly looked up into the electric stare of her partner.</p>
		<p>Syd moved her tongue in small gentle circles against
			the tender flesh beneath her. She held onto Ally's hips as she felt them
			begin to grind against her mouth. Her mission was clear now. She wanted to make
			Ally become nothing less than a weak, breathless, beautifully satisfied woman.
		</p>
		<p>Ally's couldn't keep her eyes open long enough
			to catch more than small glimpses of the woman bringing her to ecstasy. Her
			body was alive with every stroke of Syd's tongue against her. She felt
			her thoughts going numb as the pressure building inside of her was almost too
			much for her to bear. </p>
		<p>Syd's tongue moved faster as she felt the closeness
			of Ally's orgasm. She braced herself against Ally's body and felt
			the beginning of Ally's release.</p>
		<p>"Oh my... Godddd... Sydney... yessss " Ally moaned.</p>
		<p>Thrusting her hips faster and faster, Ally felt her body
			fall slave to the intense touch of her lover. As her release left her body,
			Ally felt a wholeness she had never known before to exist. Sydney rode wave
			after wave of unbidden passion and desire. The feeling that she had inside of
			her, proved to be one that she could get used to very easily. Ally's body
			slowly recovered from her climax and her breathing once again became normal.
			Syd climbed up the spent form of Ally and gently lay on top of her with both
			elbows resting on either side of Ally's head. Looking up into loving blue
			eyes, Ally spoke to her in almost a whisper.</p>
		<p>"Oh my God. Sydney, that was incredible. I have never
			known such pleasure in my life."</p>
		<p>"Good, I'm glad that I could make you feel like that. I hope that you will
			give me an opportunity to do that more often." She said as she caressed one
			side of Ally's face.</p>
		<p>"Do you see me trying stop you? Not gonna happen." she smiled and kissed Sydney
			tenderly on her lips.</p>
		<p>It was still pouring on them, and Sydney felt a shiver
			run through Ally's body.</p>
		<p>"It's time we went in an got you into a hot shower
			before you catch your death out here."</p>
		<p>"Only if you join me." she said raising an eyebrow on Sydney's face.</p>
		<p>"Well, how can I refuse such an offer?"</p>
		<p>"You can't, it's not an offer, it's a demand. I will not take
			no for an answer either, missy." Syd laughed at the mischievous face shown by
			Ally and knew that this night was only just beginning.</p>
		<p>With Jack, Pete, and Edna away, the two loved the privacy
			they were given to explore their newfound love. They collected their clothing
			from the piles strewn on the lawn, and made a quick run into the house. The
			brisk air from the air conditioning made their skin crawl with goosebumps.</p>
		<p>"Damn, it's cold in here. I'll race you to
			the shower." Sydney taunted.</p>
		<p>"Well I don't know, your legs are so much longer
			than..." Ally stopped as she raced up the stairs knowing full well that retribution
			would be in order for her cheating.</p>
		<p>"You are so dead, do you hear me, Alicia? You are mine."
			she yelled as she reached the top of the steps. She looked around the bathroom
			only to have Ally jump from behind her.</p>
		<p>"Yah!!" Ally surprised.</p>
		<p>"Ahhh!" Sydney screamed.</p>
		<p>"Gotcha!" Ally smiled in victory.</p>
		<p>"That's what you think. I'll show you whose
			got who." she said as she picked up Ally and threw her into the shower. Ally
			put up a fight and kicked and screamed the whole way, laughing in between gasps
			of air limited to her. Sydney turned on the water and watched as Ally's
			eyes became huge as the cold water slowly changed to a warmer temperature.</p>
		<p>"Come here my little Aussie. I'd like to show you
			something." she said as she wiggled her eyebrows at Sydney.</p>
		<p>"Coming my dear." she smiled back as she entered the
			shower and drew the curtain closed.</p>
		<p>Ally wasted no time as she grabbed Sydney's head
			and pulled her into a deep passionate kiss. The water gently cascaded down both
			very aroused women. Ally broke the kiss and whispered into Syd's ear.</p>
		<p>"Show me what to do. I have never done this before."</p>
		<p>"Alright, Alicia, we will make this lesson one that you'll remember for
			a long time." she purred back into Ally's ear, causing a stream of goosebumps
			down her body.</p>
		<p>Sydney reached up and took one of Ally's hands and
			gently placed it on one of her breasts. She held onto Ally's hand as they
			tenderly rubbed against the nipple with their fingers. Sydney's body reacted
			to the stimuli of their shared movements. She exhaled a deep sigh as the desire
			built between her legs once again. Ally's movements became more confident
			as she rolled the nipple with her thumb and forefinger. Syd welcomed the feel
			she was receiving and let out a small moan. She felt Ally's mouth move
			lower to take her full breast into her mouth. Her tongue circled over the nipple
			causing Syd's breath to become more and more ragged.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I think you've got it, oooh right there.
			God that feels good." Syd gasped out.</p>
		<p>"Mmm. I like this." Ally purred.</p>
		<p>Ally took her newfound courage and slowly moved her hand
			between Sydney's legs. The wetness she found increased her desire to explore
			this woman pressed against her. The water was beating down on Ally's head
			almost stroking her to take the next step. She slowly moved her fingers around
			until she found a very sensitive spot on Sydney. Her body shuddered as she felt
			the touch of her novice lover. Ally pushed Sydney against the wall as she increased
			the speed of her finger's movements. Under the spray of the showerhead,
			Sydney felt her body begin to quiver as her release started to build inside
			of her.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Alicia, God, you have no idea what you are doing
			to me."</p>
		<p>"Oh yes I do, Sydney, yes I do." she smiled inwardly knowing that she was the
			cause of her lover's shivering.</p>
		<p>"You are very good at this."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well, I am self taught if you know what I mean."</p>
		<p>Sydney smiled at Ally knowing exactly what she meant
			thinking back to a few hours earlier in this same shower. </p>
		<p>Ally quickened her movements as Sydney's breath
			became labored and her body stiffened with excitement. The feel of Syd's
			tender flesh was swollen and slippery with arousal. Ally couldn't believe
			that she was making love to woman, let alone a woman like Sydney. Her body was
			completely on fire with every sound that Sydney made. Her sultry, deep voice
			humming into her ear was music Pachelbel himself would have been proud of. Sydney
			reached down to touch Ally's passion, when she felt herself go over the
			edge.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Alicia! My God... that's it right... Oh...
			There... uunnngh" Syd cried as her orgasm cut through her core.</p>
		<p>Ally pressed Sydney harder against the wall as she felt
			herself crest with her lover. Their legs slowly gave out and they melted down
			the shower walls and into to the base of the tub. Sydney wrapped her arms around
			the smaller framed woman as their spasms slowly left their bodies. As their
			breathing reached its normal pace, they found themselves increasing their holds
			on each other. The sound of their heartbeats under the running water was all
			that could be heard.</p>
		<p>"Alicia, that was beautiful. I have never experienced
			such an overwhelming moment in my life. I can't believe that I was willing
			to throw all of this away because of my fears. Can you forgive me for being
			such a child?"</p>
		<p>"Sydney, you don't have to apologize, this is all that I need to know that
			you are for real. Just don't get up and run this time." she said as she
			tightened her hold on Sydney. </p>
		<p>"I promise, I will never leave you again." Sydney said as she kissed Ally pledging
			her love.</p>
		<p>With that admission, Ally knew that Sydney would be there
			for her forever.</p>
		<p>The next few days were spent getting to know each other
			in between their marathon love making sessions. The days were spent talking
			and laughing about their lives and people in their past. They took many walks
			and rode tandem on Polka to ensure snuggle time. Their nights were filled with
			passion and unspoken love. Sydney was teaching Ally everything she wanted to
			know and more about what makes a woman scream for more. Ally showed Syd a few
			things too. Their hearts had found their home and weren't moving anytime
			soon.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Edna walked in the door after five days spent with dirty
			old farmers and ranch owners. She was relieved to be home. She was even more
			relieved when she let her eyes roam over the two sleeping forms cuddled up on
			the couch. Ally had her body nestled against Syd's longer frame and rested
			her head against her strong shoulder. Syd's arms were wrapped around her
			young love as she held her close before falling asleep against her will.</p>
		<p>Edna quietly crept up the stairs and placed her luggage
			in her room. She passed Syd's room and noticed her room was completely
			clean and her bed was neatly made. She scratched her head as she walked further
			into Ally's room, when her lips turned upwards into a large smile. The
			sheets on the bed were strewn all over the place. Two sizes of clothing were
			found in various places around the room, leaving a trail back to the bed. Her
			heart raced with excitement for she knew that her niece would be well loved
			and taken care of. She picked up the picture from the Grand Canyon and smiled
			as she looked into the sky.</p>
		<p>"She's going to be just fine Donna, I promise. She
			has someone to watch over her now, while you look down from up there. She misses
			you Donna, but don't you worry. Between Syd and me, she is going to be
			loved and cared for until the day she leaves this place. And when that day comes,
			she'll have you, with your arms wide open for her to be cradled in once
			more. She's gonna be just fine." she said with tear filled eyes as she
			held the photograph close to her heart.</p>
		<p>She placed the picture back on the windowsill and smiled
			to herself. She turned around to head back downstairs. With dinner approaching,
			she needed to get into the kitchen. With the looks of this place, she was going
			to have a couple of starving women on her hands. And that was just fine with
			her.</p>
