	<chapter title="Part Three">
		<p>The first night sleeping in Alex's house was a quiet one for the
			two women, especially Sydney. Even though they fell off to sleep in the wee hours of the
			morning, she still woke up with the birds. She wasn't quite sure what to do with herself,
			since this was the first morning in about three years that she didn't have to tend to the
			horses in Edna's stables. Edna always would ask her to take a vacation, but Sydney would
			always politely decline. </p>

		<p>Syd decided to get up from under the warm assault of Alex's body.
			She managed to sneak out of the bed without waking her. There wasn't an easy way to awaken
			Alex, so she knew she could escape without disturbing her. She walked downstairs and
			started to clean up their mess they had made the previous night. The sight in front of her
			made her smile. Her little surprise paid off in spades. They had both had a wonderful
			time, but Sydney still felt a little guilty for not telling Alex about Sharon and her past
			with her. Syd knew she would probably feel better, but she couldn't stand the thought of
			what Alex would think of her after she knew what was done to her. She didn't want pity,
			she just wished all of the past and all of her thoughts of Sharon, would just go away.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex opened her eyes and noticed right away that she was alone.
			At first she was a little unnerved by this, then she figured that Syd probably got up at
			dawn like she usually does.</p>

		<p>"Does she ever sleep?" She sleepily said to herself.</p>

		<p>Alex got up and put a pair of shorts on and one of Syd's large
			T-shirts on and stumbled into the bathroom. After she finished with her morning
			necessities, she went downstairs in search of Sydney. She found her poolside sunning
			herself. Alex took in the breathtaking sight before her. Sydney had donned her black
			bikini and went out for a morning swim. She did a few laps then lied in the lawnchair to
			get some sunshine. She felt Alex's presence before Alex even said anything to her.</p>

		<p>"Good morning gorgeous." Syd greeted.</p>

		<p>"How do you do that?" Alex marveled.</p>

		<p>"I have many skills." She smiled and squinted up at her
			friend.</p>

		<p>"Yes, I think you have shown me that." Alex smiled
			back. "Did you sleep okay?"</p>

		<p>"Mmm, yes I did. Your bed is quite comfortable."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, I had forgotten what it felt like. I think last night was the first night in
			weeks that I didn't have a nightmare."</p>

		<p>"I was going to say something about that but I didn't want to jinx anything."</p>

		<p>"Thanks for noticing."</p>

		<p>"Hey, when you are concerned, I always notice. In a room of thousands, I would know
			if you were missing."</p>

		<p>"You are sweet." She said as she put her arms around Sydney from behind her
			chair.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but don't let that get around. I got a reputation to uphold."</p>

		<p>"Ooh, right. Sorry." She kissed Sydney's cheek.</p>

		<p>"Are you hungry sweetheart? I think you worked up quite an
			appetite from last night."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but whose fault is that?"</p>

		<p>"Oh I'll take full responsibility for that, with pleasure." She said as she gave
			a full smile to Alex.</p>

		<p>"God you are so beautiful."</p>

		<p>"So are you little one. So are you." She said as she caressed the cheek looking
			down at her. "Let's get some breakfast."</p>

		<p>"Sure. You up for going into town? I really don't want to cook."</p>

		<p>"Alright, let me put something on that's not so revealing, and we can go."</p>

		<p>"Aww and spoil my visual from across a table?"</p>

		<p>"Sorry to disappoint, but I don't think everyone would share your opinion."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I beg to differ. I'm sure there are plenty of people that wouldn't mind the
			view."</p>

		<p>"Well, too bad for them that I am already taken."</p>

		<p>"Yes, terrible shame don't you think?"</p>

		<p>"Not for me. Come on, let's eat."</p>

		<p>"There is a place called The Harbor that I know you will love. They only serve
			breakfast and lunch, but it is the best food around as far as breakfast. They will make
			you any kind of egg that you can think of. It's great stuff. Ooh I can't wait." She
			said clapping and skipping up to the house. Sydney just watched the childlike antics
			coming from Alex with a huge smile.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex drove into town like she was visiting for the first time.
			Her memories of life with her parents seemed so long ago. This was a whole new thing for
			her. She was just grateful that Sydney was there with her. They pulled into the small
			shopping plaza and parked near the restaurant. Alex couldn't believe that she was home
			again.</p>

		<p>"God Sydney, it feels like I have been gone a lifetime. It
			is so strange to be here."</p>

		<p>"I bet honey. Did you want to go in?"</p>

		<p>"In a sec, I just want to look around for a minute."</p>

		<p>Alex just walked through the tiny plaza gazing in every window to see if they had changed
			as much as she had in the last few months. She came across a tiny clothing shop and smiled
			to Sydney.</p>

		<p>"They have the best cashmere sweaters in this place. Mom got me one for Christmas
			last year that is just the best."</p>

		<p>"Did you want to browse for awhile before brunch?" She said looking at her
			watch.</p>

		<p>"Nah, I just liked reminiscing. We can go, I am truly
			hungry."</p>

		<p>"OK hon, let's go. I hope there isn't a long wait."</p>

		<p>"Hopefully not, but unfortunately this place is usually
			packed around lunchtime. Lots of business people come here from all over just to eat here.
			It's really great."</p>

		<p>"Can't wait, let's go and get our name in."</p>

		<p>Looking up from her menus the hostess asked, "How many?"</p>

		<p>"Just the two of us." Alex replied.</p>

		<p>"Name?"</p>

		<p>"McKenna."</p>

		<p>"McKenna?" The hostess asked again.</p>

		<p>"Yes Alex McKenna."</p>

		<p>"Wow, you probably don't remember me, it's Melissa Milo, we went to the high school
			together."</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, Melissa, how are you?"</p>

		<p>"I am doing well. I heard about what happened to your parents. I am so sorry. Your
			father helped a lot of this town's "Most Stressed"."</p>

		<p>"Thanks. It's been a rough year but I have had a lot of help from some really
			wonderful people. My dad loved what he did and really cared about his patients. I know a
			lot of people will miss him."</p>

		<p>"Yes that's true. Umm, the wait will only be a few more minutes."</p>

		<p>"That's all? This placed is jammed." Alex said as she looked around the
			restaurant.</p>

		<p>"I'll get you in. I have a little bit of an edge over these people."</p>

		<p>"Thanks Melissa." Alex gratefully smiled.</p>

		<p>"Sure Alex, take care." Melissa said with a sincere smile.</p>

		<p>"You too, good to see you."</p>

		<p>"You too." She replied as she walked towards oncoming
			guests.</p>

		<p>"She seemed nice." Syd chimed in.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, she was extremely quiet in high school. You could be
			guaranteed a smile from her though if you said hello. She was one of those people who you
			knew would be a loyal friend. You know?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, so why didn't you hang with her?"</p>

		<p>"We hung out in different circles I guess you could say. Funny, I don't really see or
			talk to any of those people now. My only constant has been Tracey."</p>

		<p>"They say people change their ways in time. Those others weren't meant to be your
			friends."</p>

		<p>"I guess not. I didn't even hear from alot of them when my parents died."</p>

		<p>"That's terrible. I'm sorry."</p>

		<p>"What for? I am much better off without them." Alex said confidently.</p>

		<p>A voice came from the front counter. "McKenna, party of
			two."</p>

		<p>"That's us, come on!" Alex jumped from the waiting
			seats.</p>

		<p>"Right behind you." Syd chuckled at her obviously
			hungry partner.</p>

		<p>The two women were seated in a large booth in the upper level of
			the restaurant. Syd just looked around in disbelief at a place being so crowded that only
			served two meals out of the day.</p>

		<p>"It's really nice in here."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, like I said a lot of people come here from all over. I think some just spend
			their lunch hour in the car to get here."</p>

		<p>"Wow, it must have a great reputation." Sydney added.</p>

		<p>"Yes it does, and it seems to be growing."</p>

		<p>A waitress arrived at their table, "What can I get you ladies? Anything cold to drink
			today?"</p>

		<p>"I'll just have water." Sydney said.</p>

		<p>"Will that be bottled, filtered, mineral, carbonated,
			caffeinated or tap?"</p>

		<p>Sydney just stared at Alex with her mouth open and eyes wide. She then returned her stare
			to the waitress. Alex had to stifle her laugh with her hand.</p>

		<p>"Umm, I guess tap is fine."</p>

		<p>"Lemon or no lemon?"</p>

		<p>'Christ I just want a glass of water!!' She thought to herself. "No lemon...thank
			you."</p>

		<p>"And you miss?" The waitress turned to Alex.</p>

		<p>"I'll have what she's having." Alex said as she stopped
			herself from laughing out loud.</p>

		<p>The waitress flipped her pad closed, smiled, and walked to get their innocuous beverages.</p>

		<p>"Oh......my God. All I asked for was water. I never really
			thought about how many different ways people would drink it. Jesus!!" Syd said while
			still wide eyed.</p>

		<p>Laughing with her, "I know, I wasn't sure if I should stop her to take a breath or
			not. Nothing is simple anymore, you know? Not EVEN water." She said looking at her
			menu, "What are you going to get?"</p>

		<p>"God, I have no idea. If ordering water was this much trouble, I am afraid to order
			anything of substance."</p>

		<p>Giggling, "Don't be, just get what you want. I'm sure they can make anything that you
			like."</p>

		<p>"We'll see." She said smiling.</p>

		<p>The waitress came back with their glasses of tap water, and
			opened her pad up to take the ladies' orders. Her eyes widened with the amount of food
			that Alex ordered. Sydney struggled through the ordering process and hoped to get her food
			the way she liked. Alex seemed confident that she would.</p>

		<p>"Would you excuse me Alex, I am going to visit the ladies
			room. Where is it, do you know?"</p>

		<p>"Umm...yeah... it's over by the kitchen area...see the arrow?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, thanks hon. See you in a bit."</p>

		<p>"OK." Alex answered as she grabbed a package of
			breadsticks and began dipping them into the butter. "Mmm, God I am so hungry."
			She said to the empty seat across from her.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney walked into the ladies room and did what she needed to do in there. She walked out
			of the stall and walked towards the sink to wash her hands and face. She rinsed off her
			face and felt a towel being held out to her. She accepted it and dried her face.</p>

		<p>"Thanks..." Her words stopped cold when her eyes met
			with dark brown ones.</p>

		<p>"Hello Sydney. My my my, what a small world it is."
			Sharon chuckled.</p>

		<p>"What the hell are you doing here?" Syd nearly spat
			trying to control her emotions.</p>

		<p>"Now Sydney is that anyway to treat an old friend?" She
			crooned.</p>

		<p>"You are NOT my friend. Have you been following me? What the
			hell do you want from me? Answer my question!" She said very impatiently.</p>

		<p>"Following you? My aren't we the arrogant one. Don't flatter yourself darling, I am
			here on business."</p>

		<p>"Business?" She said disbelieving.</p>

		<p>"Yes darling, daddy's little company is planning a merger with one of the big boys of
			the Midwest. He sent me to..."</p>

		<p>"To use your only attribute? He wanted you to seduce the big boys into seeing things
			"your way"? Right? You make me sick." She tried to push away from the
			platinum blonde invading her space.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, you can't still be angry with me, can you?"</p>

		<p>"Sharon, I don't feel anything but pity for you. Is there anything else?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, you can tell me the name of that fine little thing sitting with you."</p>

		<p>Sydney couldn't control her temper any longer. She threw Sharon up against the wall and
			pinned her forearm under the blonde's throat. "You even breathe on her, and I will
			rip you apart with my bare hands. Do you understand me?"</p>

		<p>"That's alright Sydney, I know all about young Alexandra.
			Shame what happened to her parents. I bet she is desperate need of comfort. I'm sure I
			could..." Sharon was cut off by added pressure of Sydney's arm at her throat.</p>

		<p>"You know what Sharon? You have about two seconds to shut
			the fuck up before I kill your whoring ass. Leave her alone you psychotic freak or I swear
			to you...." Sydney hissed at Sharon.</p>

		<p>Laughing through her gritted teeth. "Oh Sydney...God I forgot how sexy you are.
			Especially when you get angry. Does she see that angry side of you Sydney? Does she know
			what a bad ass you are Sydney? Does she know about Billy? I bet you didn't tell her about
			that, did you?" Sharon paused and watched proudly as her words dug into Syd like
			daggers. "Does she see that aggressive sexual side of you? Does she like it rough
			like I did... Sydney?" The blonde taunted. Sydney's breath was coming in short gusts
			of emotion. Sharon just laughed and smiled. "Hmm?"</p>

		<p>"You stay away from her Sharon. She is NOTHING like you!!! You harm one hair on her
			head, I swear to you; I will make it my purpose in life to make yours a living hell. If
			you even SPEAK my brother's name again, I will be your greatest nightmare. I promise you
			that." She seductively hissed into Sharon's ear. </p>

		<p>"Ooh baby, I'm getting so hot. Talk to me some more."
			She said as she licked her lips.</p>

		<p>"God you are disgusting!!" Sydney spat as she let go of
			her hold on Sharon. She pointed her finger at Sharon in warning. "If you do anything,
			or say anything to her, I'll come after you." She said and walked out of the ladies'
			room leaving an amused Sharon behind to straighten her suit. Sharon smiled at her
			reflection.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, you ain't seen nothing yet." She smiled
			with aplomb.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney stormed out of the ladies room and stopped to collect
			herself. She stood behind the wall separating the restrooms from the main room of the
			restaurant. After taking a few breaths, she made her way back to the table to where Alex
			was seated.</p>

		<p>"Hey sweetie, are you alright? You look a little pale."
			Alex observed.</p>

		<p>"Alex......I...." Syd started as she sat down.</p>

		<p>"Here we are..." The waitress came just as Sydney began to tell Alex what had
			happened.</p>

		<p>"Scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and an English muffin with
			strawberry jam." She said as she put Sydney's plate down in front of her.</p>

		<p>"And for you, we have a three egg four cheese omelet, a side
			of bacon, a side of sausage, a small stack of blueberry pancakes, hash browns, an English
			muffin with grape jelly, a glass of milk, and two glasses of orange juice. Honey, I don't
			know where you are going to put this, but bon appet"t." She said as she
			sauntered off to another table.</p>

		<p>"Oooo, look at this, God I am so hungry. Dig in
			sweetheart." Alex said excitedly as she began to eat as if she hadn't in a week.</p>

		<p>Sydney watched the younger woman consume huge amounts of food as
			she sat and stared at her full plate.</p>

		<p>"Shydnee, are yooo k?" Alex said with a partially full
			mouth as she noticed Syd not eating.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, um, I think I lost my appetite. I'm not feeling that
			well all of a sudden. Maybe it's a little flu left from last night." She lied.</p>

		<p>"Oh honey, I'm sorry. I forgot about that. God, I'm so
			sorry. We can take this to go so we can get back home." Alex compromised.</p>

		<p>"NO! Please finish your meal. You know how much I love to
			watch you eat." She tried to sincerely smile but it just wasn't coming through, and
			Alex saw right through it.</p>

		<p>"Sydney what is wrong, honey? Please tell me." Alex
			almost pleaded. </p>

		<p>"I will tell you, but just not here, and just not now. When
			the time is right Alex, when the time is right." Syd explained.</p>

		<p>"OK, I will hold you to that baby. You can tell me anything.
			It won't change the way I feel about you, nothing could."</p>

		<p>"Thanks sweetheart, I don't know what I would do without you." She reached
			across the table to hold Alex's hand.</p>

		<p>Sharon strolled out of the ladies room and glanced up at Sydney.
			They made eye contact, Sharon winked at her, smiled, then strut out of the restaurant.
			Sydney swallowed her emotions as she watched Sharon leave and gently caressed Alex's hand.
			Alex looked up from her meal and smiled at Sydney. She continued to devour the food in
			front of her until there was nothing but crumbs left. The waitress came by and in
			disbelief and took Alex's empty plates. She tossed away Sydney's uneaten eggs as per
			Sydney's request. 'Who likes to eat reheated eggs anyway?' Syd thought to herself.</p>

		<p>Alex and Sydney walked up to the counter and Sydney insisted on
			paying for their meal. With a final huff, Alex agreed to let her pay and they left the
			restaurant. The two were quiet on the way home and Alex couldn't help but wonder what had
			set Sydney off. She was never like this. Alex looked over at her partner and saw the lost
			look on her face as she stared out the window.</p>

		<p>'What is going on with you baby? God I wish you would just tell
			me. It can't be that bad. It can't be...' Alex thought to herself as they pulled into her
			driveway.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex went into the garage to get the last of the boxes she had to
			pack up the rest of her things. She had decided with Edna that the best way to handle all
			of the furniture in the house was to have an estate sale. Whatever she could sell she
			would, and whatever she couldn't she would donate or throw away. She had gone through
			quite a bit before moving to Montana, but there was more than ten years worth of stuff
			here. Tracey had helped her on more than one occasion get her ready for her big move. Her
			mother's jewelry and clothing had been sorted and given away. What people didn't want she
			donated to the Salvation Army. She had kept her mother's wedding ring set for herself. It
			was always a favorite of hers and she knew her mom would have wanted her to have it. There
			were a few items of her clothing that had extreme sentimental value to them, so she kept
			them as well. Her mother had recently gone to Paris and had brought back some wonderful
			perfume, Boucheron. On days when Alex really missed her, she would spray it into the air
			just to have her scent nearby.</p>

		<p>Alex cleaned out her parent's room in a few hours while Sydney
			decided to take care of the living and dining rooms downstairs. Sydney took this time to
			wonder why Sharon was in town, and how she knew about Alex. She was shaking with feelings
			she hadn't felt in a long time. She was angry, nervous, and most of all she was in shock.
			Seeing Sharon was not on her things to do list for the day, and really was playing with
			her head.</p>

		<p>'God, what the hell is she doing here anyway? How does she know
			about Alexandra and what happened to her parents? It's not like she gives a shit about the
			human race, well only if she gets to sleep with them. Uugghhh, why the hell did she have
			to show up?' Sydney was reeling in her mind as Alex walked downstairs to meet her.</p>

		<p>"Hey baby, feeling any better?" Alex asked
			sympathetically.</p>

		<p>"Yeah I guess a little." She lied.</p>

		<p>"Are you hungry at all? I could make you something to eat
			since you didn't get anything at the restaurant."</p>

		<p>"No sweetheart that is okay, I don't really feel up to eating. Did you talk to Tracey
			at all? Does she want to go out this evening?"</p>

		<p>"I did get a chance to talk with her briefly after lunch but her new girlfriend wants
			to spend time with her tonight. So I guess its just you and me tonight."</p>

		<p>"Ohh, new girlfriend eh? Is she cute?" Alex wiggled her eyebrows.</p>

		<p>"Well according to Trace, she is a "hotty". I
			guess they finally had sex, which is weird I think."</p>

		<p>"Sex with your girlfriend is weird? Um, I think you had better talk to mine then,
			'cause she kind of likes that."</p>

		<p>Laughing, "Ha ha, no I mean it's kinda soon for Tracey. She was the type to wait a
			while before making that kind of commitment. She has only known this woman, um, Char I
			think her name is, for a couple months."</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, I hate to break it to you, but you and I made love within days of knowing
			each other."</p>

		<p>"I know, but I am not Tracey, nor do I think it is the same. Char is a business
			associate of Tracey's. They have only really seen each other like four or five
			times."</p>

		<p>"Oh, so she's isn't from around here?"</p>

		<p>"No I think she is on the West Coast somewhere. LA maybe? I don't remember. Anyway,
			she just arrived and is actually staying for a week or so this time, so maybe we'll get to
			meet her."</p>

		<p>"Great, maybe we can get together or something with them for dinner or what
			not."</p>

		<p>"I think that is a great idea. I really want to meet the woman who made Tracey's
			morals go right down the crapper!!" She said with a large smile.</p>

		<p>"Well I'm sure she is something else if she broke down
			Tracey's walls so easily."</p>

		<p>"Well, I guess we have to wait to find out."</p>

		<p>"Yep." Sydney agreed. "Ah, I got most of these rooms in boxes for the sale.
			Did you want any of this stuff? There is some really nice porcelain statues and things
			here."</p>

		<p>"No, I pretty much went through and kept all that I wanted to keep, as did Edna. My
			other family really didn't come around that much so I don't think they are getting any of
			it. I think I would rather sell it or donate the rest. It looks so damn empty in here.
			It's like someone else's house."</p>

		<p>Sydney wrapped her arms around Alex. "I know baby. How are you holding up? Can I do
			anything for you?" Syd asked sincerely.</p>

		<p>"You just being here with me is all I will ever need. Thank
			you for coming here with me. I'm not sure I would be this together had you not."</p>

		<p>"Where you go, I go, get used to it." She smiled into the top of Alex's head.</p>

		<p>"That's easy enough." Alex tightened her hold on her.
			'I love you baby' She thought to herself.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>ONE WEEK LATER</p>

		<p>"So everything is a go for tomorrow night?" Sydney asked Tracey quietly.</p>

		<p>"Yes, I have called all of our friends and Edna should
			arrive early tomorrow morning. I will pick her up from the airport and keep her with me
			until the evening. Are you sure she has no idea?" Tracey inquired insistently.</p>

		<p>"No Tracey, she hasn't the foggiest. I can't wait! She needs
			this so much. I think a night spent with old friends in celebration will be exactly what
			she needs to give her some kind of closure here. And Tracey?" Syd prompted.</p>

		<p>"Yeah?" She responded.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for this. You are truly a good friend. I can see
			why she speaks so highly of you."</p>

		<p>"Right back atcha babe. She is so smitten with you. I have never seen her this happy.
			So I guess thanks are in order to you."</p>

		<p>"I really care about Alexandra. I wouldn't hurt her for anything in the world. I
			would rather spit on the Pope than break her heart."</p>

		<p>"That's a lovely visual, but I get your meaning."</p>

		<p>"Alright then. I guess the last thing is to make sure we have enough to drink, the
			catering place knows the time and place. This is going to be a night that we all will
			remember, for a long time."</p>

		<p>"I hope so, Sydney."</p>

		<p>"Me too. I've got to run. Ciao." Sydney hung up abruptly.</p>

		<p>"Ciao?" Tracey smirked as she hung up the phone. "Alex, you've got yourself
			an incredible woman." She said as she snuggled up to Char. "And so do I."
			Tracey said as she kissed the smiling face looking up at her. "Babe, you are going to
			love Alex and Sydney. They are so awesome. I can't wait. Alex is going to be so
			surprised!"</p>

		<p>'So is Sydney.' Sharon smirked into Tracey's body. "I can't wait to see her
			expression!! God how I love surprises." Although it was Sydney's surprise Sharon was
			after, not Alex's.</p>

		<p>"Me too Char, me too."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tracey knew Char from Backburn Inc. a small software company
			looking to expand their company to the Midwest. Char came into Chicago to make a play for
			her company. Tracey being one of the research managers decided to meet with her to talk
			about her father's ideas of coming to the Midwest. They met a couple of months ago and
			have seen each other a few times to discuss their companies and what they might offer one
			another. Talking at a restaurant the two women discussed many things outside of work. They
			both discovered that they enjoyed the company of women, and made a point to see each other
			the next time Char came into town. Tracey could not wait. Char was a beautiful woman
			blonde hair, deep brown eyes and a beautifully shaped mouth. She stood about 5'8" and
			had absolutely no body fat. To Tracey she wreaked perfection. </p>

		<p>Char came into Chicago to check the status of their merger and,
			of course, to see Tracey. The two were fast becoming more than friends. The distance was
			the only thing to come between them. Tracey and Char consummated their relationship after
			Char's third visit to Chicago. Tracey was not one for casual sex, but there was nothing
			casual about Char. She was extraordinarily exciting. </p>

		<p>Everything about her was a mystery to Tracey. She seemed very
			elusive about her past, it was obvious she had been hurt and did not want to reopen old
			wounds. After Tracey had unsuccessfully asked her about it, she decided to leave well
			enough alone. Char didn't come in that often, so she just wanted to enjoy what little time
			they had together. Tracey was so excited about her enigmatic lover she couldn't wait for
			Alex to meet her. Tracey told Alex about Char the day she met her:</p>

		<p>"Hello?" Alex answered.</p>

		<p>"Hey baby!!"</p>

		<p>"Trace!! How are you honey? God I miss you."</p>

		<p>"Me too, I am really good. How are you doing?" Tracey asked tenderly.</p>

		<p>"Things are alright Tracey. They get better each day. Sydney
			has been a great support to me. I can't wait for you two to meet. You are going to love
			her!!!"</p>

		<p>"Well, I have some news myself."</p>

		<p>"Do you??? Who did you meet and where?" Alex laughed knowing full well it had to
			be a woman.</p>

		<p>"Alex, God, she is such a hotty!! She is like 5'8",
			blonde with brown eyes and a body do die for. There is no pinchability on this woman. The
			girl is tight!!" She said exuberantly.</p>

		<p>"Wow Trace, she sounds fabulous. I can't wait to meet her.
			Where did you guys hook up?"</p>

		<p>"Wanna hear something funny? We met at work. I was just saying how horrid it was
			working here since their was no eye candy, then in walks Char. God, she took my breath
			away. Girl she is soooo sexy. She could turn any straight woman, I am sure of it. God
			Damn!!"</p>

		<p>"Damn Trace, sounds like you got a keeper there. Have you gone out yet? Like on a
			date or anything?"</p>

		<p>"Well that's the problem. We went out once after one of our meetings to a restaurant
			and we just clicked. We talked about everything. I talked about you and Sydney and how
			long you and I have known each other. I mean we just talked and talked. I haven't met a
			woman that could hold a conversation like that in a long time. I was ready to swear off
			intelligent women because I didn't think they existed anymore!" They chuckled to each
			other. "No, seriously she is really amazing Alex."</p>

		<p>"I am so happy for you. But wait, you mentioned a problem?"</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, um well, she lives in California. She works for a small software company
			that wants to move to the Midwest. So we are looking to do a small expansion to bring them
			over here. Blah blah you don't need to hear that part, that's the boring stuff. So she
			came out here to talk to some companies and she found us. The rest is history. So the
			problem is she lives across the country. I don't know if I am up for a long distance
			relationship. I mean, part of me says "Man, go get her!", then the sensible part
			of me says "No, it'll be too hard on you." I don't know what to do, but for
			right now, she is all I can think about."</p>

		<p>"Well see what happens the next time she comes into town and play it from
			there."</p>

		<p>"I guess you're right, but man. My luck huh? I finally find a "Woo!" girl
			and she lives two thousand miles away."</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry Trace. Um, on a happier note, I think I'll be coming home in a month or
			so."</p>

		<p>"Really? That is awesome!! I really miss you Alex."</p>

		<p>"Me too hon. I am gonna sell the house, so I need to pack up and get it ready to
			sell. It'll probably be at the end of September."</p>

		<p>"Kick ass, I can't wait to see you. I can't wait to meet Sydney. She sounds
			wonderful."</p>

		<p>"She is Trace she is. But ah, I gotta get going so I will call you with information
			on when I'll be coming home okay?"</p>

		<p>"OK hon, take care of yourself, I love you."</p>

		<p>"I love you too Trace. I'll talk with you soon. Bye."</p>

		<p>"Bye."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Who was that on the phone hon?" Alex asked a startled
			Sydney.</p>

		<p>"Um, it was Tracey, I thought you were going to take a
			nap?" Sydney quickly replied.</p>

		<p>"No I couldn't sleep. What did she want?"</p>

		<p>"Well she wanted to see what we were doing tomorrow night. I guess she wants to
			introduce her new girlfriend to us."</p>

		<p>"Ooh cool!! I should call her back." Alex said excitedly.</p>

		<p>"No!" Alex raised her eyebrows at Sydney's tone of voice. Thinking quickly
			Sydney said, "Um, well she said they were going out and she would call you in the
			morning or something."</p>

		<p>Sighing, "Alright I guess I'll talk to her tomorrow
			then." Alex took a look around and saw that the entire downstairs had been cleaned.
			"My goodness Sydney. Look at all the work you did. This place is immaculate. You can
			actually hear an echo now. Thank you so much for all of your help. I couldn't have done
			all of this without you."</p>

		<p>"You are most welcome sweetheart. I just want everything to go smoothly and as
			pain-free as possible for you. I know how hard this must be. I remember when we had to
			pack up my mom's belongings. It was really hard on my brother and me. She was all that we
			had left after dad and.....um....well after he died. I can't imagine what you must be
			going through. I, at least had Tim."</p>

		<p>"Well Miss Sydney, I have you, and Eddi and I have Tracey.
			So I think I am doing just fine. Thank you for your concern though." She said as she
			circled her arms around Syd's larger frame and laid her head against her chest. </p>

		<p>"You're welcome baby." Syd murmured into Alex. They sat
			like that for several minutes and enjoyed the peace that passed between them.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney couldn't wait for the festivities to begin. She was
			determined to make this the best birthday Alex ever had. She was fighting a mental battle
			with herself and decided that she was going to bite the bullet and tell Alex that she
			loved her tonight. She had purchased Alex's birthday present when Alex was sleeping in.
			She found her way into town and went in to the town's jewelers. Her eyes immediately
			fixated on a simple gold band with several tiny diamonds embedded in it. </p>

		<p>"Ooh, I like that one, may I see it please?" Syd
			pointed inside the glass case.</p>

		<p>"Absolutely, it is quite an eye catcher." The jeweler opened the case and took
			out the ring and handed it to Sydney.</p>

		<p>Sydney fingered the small band and decided it was simple yet classy, just like Alexandra.
			It was perfect.</p>

		<p>"Can I have it engraved today? I need it for tonight."</p>

		<p>"As luck would have it, my engraver is working today which is rare for a Saturday.
			Let me ask him if he has anything else lined up." He said as he smiled at his
			customer. "Just give me a minute, I'll be right back." He took the ring in
			question with him to the back of the store. He went into the storeroom and looked for his
			employee. </p>

		<p>Several moments had passed when the stocky man returned with a
			smile on his face.</p>

		<p>"Well ma'am, you are in luck. He said he would take care of
			this for you while you waited. Do you have a few minutes?"</p>

		<p>Excitedly Sydney shook her head. "Yes I do, thank you so very much. This will mean a
			great deal to a very special person." She gave the man a dazzling smile to which he
			found himself hypnotized by.</p>

		<p>Shaking himself out of his reverie, he began filling out the
			invoice. Sydney gave him Alex's ring size and what she wanted engraved on it. Within a
			half hour she had her gift and was on her way home.</p>

		<p>"Now if I can keep this courage I will give it to her
			tonight. I don't know what I am worried about. Alexandra is nothing like Sharon. I just
			have to keep reminding myself of that. They are nothing alike, thank God." She said
			to herself as she pulled into the driveway. </p>

		<p>She parked the car in the garage and went into the house to wake
			her sleeping woman. She walked up the stairs and into Alex's room to find a breathtaking
			view. Alex had rolled onto her stomach while clutching her pillow. Her naked form was only
			covered from her waist down. Her knee was sticking out of the sheet and slightly hanging
			over the bed's edge. Her golden locks were spilled down her back and shoulders with a few
			stray strands falling into her face. She was absolutely beautiful. Suddenly Syd's fears
			all seemed to disappear with one look at Alexandra. Seeing this angel before her
			completely dissolved any reservations she'd had in proclaiming her love.</p>

		<p>After taking a moment to memorize every curve of Alex's lithe
			form, she decided to kick off her shoes and curl up next to her. </p>

		<p>Alex immediately felt Sydney's presence and rolled her back into
			Sydney's front. Sydney's arm draped around Alex's waist in reflex, and the rest of her
			body spooned into Alex's back. It was a perfect fit. </p>

		<p>Sydney just lay there smelling the wonderful scent that was Alex.
			Her hair smelled like flowers and her body emitted a fragrance that was crisp and clean.
			Sydney would have stayed like that all morning, but Alex stirred awake and rolled towards
			Sydney.</p>

		<p>"Mm, good morning sweetheart." Alex sleepily said.</p>

		<p>"Good morning sleepy head. Did you sleep well?"</p>

		<p>"Mmhmm, I did. I have slept so well since coming home. I hope I don't get spoiled by
			this."</p>

		<p>"I think you have just been really tired. We have been doing alot since we got here.
			You are just tuckered out."</p>

		<p>"Perhaps. Have you been up long?"</p>

		<p>"Nah, just an hour or so. I couldn't resist coming back to snuggle with you. You
			looked so damn cute."</p>

		<p>Alex just smiled into Sydney's chest and inhaled deeply. She loved the way this woman
			smelled. She had this wonderful musk about her that was all her own. It was intoxicating
			as well as arousing. She could feel Sydney's fingernails moving up and down her back and
			she felt the gooseflesh rising. The touches became more urgent as did the need to be one
			with each other. Alex tilted her head up and captured Syd's wanting mouth with her own.
			Their tongues instantly sought out the other's. They tenderly stroked each other's tongues
			and nipped at each other's lips. Alex caught Sydney's bottom lip and began to suck on it.
			She fully pressed her mouth against Sydney's again and felt a bolt of desire wash over
			her. Sydney caught Alex's moan in her mouth and immediately wanted to be naked against
			this woman. Alex looked into deep stormy blue eyes and knew that breakfast was not going
			to be an option this morning.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"OK Edna, I am gonna take her out for about an hour, I'll
			make something up. I know, I'll make her take me to the beach. She wanted to go there
			yesterday and I wasn't in the mood. So I'll make her take me there while you guys pile
			into the house. The caterers will be there shortly after we leave. We just need to check
			on the beverages. I ordered a bunch from Terry's Liquors and we just need to pick it up. I
			couldn't very well bring a bunch of alcohol into the house without explanation. After we
			surprise her, I will run out and get the drinks. Sound like a plan?"</p>

		<p>"Okay, Syd, this is going to be so great. It sounds like you have it planned and
			ready to go. She is going to be so surprised! Tracey and I will be around the corner. We
			will watch for your car to leave and we will pull up, so make sure you don't forget
			anything, okay?"</p>

		<p>"Alright Edna, I am so glad that you could make it. You being here will make it all
			that much more special for her. She loves you so much."</p>

		<p>"I know. I can say the same about you dear."</p>

		<p>Sydney could feel the blush creep up her neck. "Thanks for saying so Edna. I'll see
			you all in about two hours. Hey, is Tracey's girlfriend coming too? I know that Alex is
			really looking forward to meeting her."</p>

		<p>"Yes, she will be here later. Tracey said she had some things to do before-hand, so
			she wouldn't be able to make it in time for the surprise."</p>

		<p>"Ok, at least she is coming. OK let me think here for a sec. I do believe that is
			everything. I'll see you soon Edna."</p>

		<p>"Okay, dear, make this work dammit. I didn't come all this way for nothin!" She
			kidded.</p>

		<p>"No problem, Alex has no idea. I gotta run she's out of the
			shower, the water just turned off. Bye." She whispered and gently hung up the
			receiver.</p>

		<p>Sydney took one last look around and saw that none of the party
			favors were in sight. She smiled to herself and went upstairs into Alex's bedroom to
			change and waited for her love to exit the bathroom.</p>

		<p>The door opened and steam billowed from the bathroom. Alex walked
			into her room to find Sydney dressing and smirking at her with her jeans part way open.</p>

		<p>"Well, don't you look like the cat who just swallowed the
			canary. What's up with that smirk?" Alex teased.</p>

		<p>"Nothin baby, you just look so sexy, I can't help myself." Sydney purred.</p>

		<p>"Mmhhmm, whatever you say. You look great Sydney, are we going somewhere?"</p>

		<p>"I'm not sure yet, I thought you liked it when I dressed like this."</p>

		<p>"When you wear those black jeans you have the greatest butt in the world. It makes me
			want to squeeze it!!" Alex grinned devilishly.</p>

		<p>"I think we have squeezed enough body parts for one day,
			don't you?"</p>

		<p>"Says you! I could do it all day long. You must be getting old."</p>

		<p>"Old my ass, I'll show you old!!" She laughed and threw Alex on the bed and
			mercilessly began tickling her. Alex tried really hard to pretend that it had no effect on
			her but she couldn't fake it for long.</p>

		<p>"I GIVE!!!!!!!!!!" Alex panted. "Please...oh
			Syd....stop...please!!" She managed to get out between giggle fits. </p>

		<p>Sydney ceased her attack and gently kissed Alex's cheek. She
			helped her up and walked to the closet to look for an outfit for Alex to wear. Alex jumped
			into the bathroom to dry her hair and apply a small amount of makeup to her face. When she
			was finished she went back to her room and found Sydney holding up some of Alex's
			clothing.</p>

		<p>"I would like you to wear this tonight."</p>

		<p>"Sydney, what's going on? Are you taking me to dinner?"</p>

		<p>"Mmmaybe. We haven't heard from Tracey yet about her meeting up with us, so I figured
			we should get ready anyway. If she doesn't call we'll go out, just the two of us. If she
			does call, we still go out. Sound good?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, I never knew you liked these pants so much. I would have worn them more
			often."</p>

		<p>"Well speaking of nice butts, your's looks fabulous in those black slacks. I like the
			vest with that shirt too." Sydney pointed as Alex dressed under instruction for the
			first time since the first grade. </p>

		<p>"Shoes Miss Sydney? What shoes?"</p>

		<p>"No shoes, wear your black boots. That will finish it off just right." Syd said
			as she watched Alex put the finishing touches on her outfit.</p>

		<p>"See now? You have brought a little bit of the country home
			to you. You are beautiful Alexandra." Syd said as she kissed her gently on the lips. </p>

		<p>Alex turned around in the mirror to see what Syd saw in her. She
			had on a black pair of pants, a long sleeved white collarless shirt with her sleeves
			rolled up, a black vest and black boots. "I look like a bank robber. All I need is a
			black cowboy hat and a trusty steed and I'll be on my way!" She joked.</p>

		<p>"You look very sexy, trust me. Although seeing you on a horse always has been a
			favorite of mine. It must be looking at your legs straddling something that really gets me
			going."</p>

		<p>"You are encourageable Sydney Thompson!!"</p>

		<p>"Always. Now let me get finished here."</p>

		<p>Sydney went to the closet again and pulled out a finely knit, gray, cropped V-Neck sweater
			and pulled it over her head. It fit snugly against her muscular torso and showed her belly
			when she raised her arms. She wrapped a black braided belt through her belt loops and
			looked for the right shoes. She slipped on a pair of black loafers and brushed her hair so
			it loosely fell across her back. She added a little color to her lips and eyes and she was
			ready. Alex took a breath and slowly let it out. Syd's raven hair mixed with her cerulean
			eyes and dark clothing made her look like nothing Alex had ever seen before. Sydney was
			stunning.</p>

		<p>"I thought we could take a drive down to that beach you
			wanted to show me. I bet the colors down there are beautiful this time of year."</p>

		<p>"Ooh Sydney, that would be wonderful. It is gorgeous around this time. You really
			want to? It may get a little chilly." Alex sincerely questioned.</p>

		<p>"Well that's why I'll have you on my arm, to keep me
			warm." She answered before she gave Alex a full smile, melting the young girl's
			heart. "Come on then, let's get this night underway."</p>

		<p>"After you my dear." Alex gestured towards the stairs.</p>

		<p>The two walked arm in arm down the stairs and grabbed their
			jackets. They got into the car and pulled slowly out of the driveway. Once they rounded
			the corner, Tracey and Edna pulled into the driveway and headed up to the house. There was
			lots to do in the next hour to make this a night to remember.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part Four">
		<p>Alex drove down the winding road to get to the beach. The steep
		incline made two cars passing one another nearly impossible. Alex could tell Sydney was a
		little unnerved, so she held onto her hand until she felt the taller woman calm.</p>

		<p>"It's OK Hon, I have driven down here a million times.
		Relax." Alex soothed.</p>

		<p>"It's just such a curve on such a hill, it's kinda scary
		don't you think?" Syd asked.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, at first I would always make Tracey drive because I
		was always afraid I would hit someone. The more I drove it, the more at ease I
		became." Alex explained.</p>

		<p>"Well, I for one, am glad that you are driving. I think I
		would be too preoccupied with the view. This is really pretty Alexandra."</p>

		<p>"It should be, they spent over eight million dollars on the restoration of it."</p>

		<p>"Eight....million.....dollars?" Sydney gasped.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, see what happens when you get a roomful of bored,
		retired, millionaires together? They even made the city pay for it. Like they just
		couldn't reach into their little mad money jars and pay for it themselves. Some of the
		people in this town make me crazy."</p>

		<p>"Wow, I can see why. Why did your parents stay here? I would have been dying to get
		away from here."</p>

		<p>"It was a safe place to bring up children; there isn't much crime here. My dad's
		practice was here, and mom liked to golf at the club, which is only a mile or so away from
		home. They had a good life, why would they leave?"</p>

		<p>"I guess you are right. Did you like this place growing
		up?"</p>

		<p>"It had it's moments, but all in all, I do like this place alot. It's very beautiful
		here, and how many towns are there, where it's safe to walk just about anywhere, without
		being bothered by someone? It's really expensive to live here though. I am very lucky that
		my parents were able to give me the life that I had."</p>

		<p>"It's nice that you see that. Some people, when they are born into money don't feel
		quite the same way as you do. A lot of people expect to be catered to or just don't know
		how to do anything for themselves. You are so not like that. I can't tell you how happy
		that makes me."</p>

		<p>"I am glad Sydney. I don't know if I could ever be like that. My whole high school
		class seemed to be filled with people like that. Let's just say that I am very happy I
		didn't turn out that way." Alex paused when she remembered something from her past.
		"You know what? OK, this is the kind of people that I went to school with,
		ready?"</p>

		<p>"OK, tell me." Sydney said amusedly and shifted in her seat to watch Alex's face
		become more and more animated.</p>

		<p>"I had a locker that was next to one of the more popular
		girls in my grade. I think her name was Jordan DuBois, or something ridiculous like that.
		Anyway, she would keep an extra outfit in her locker, just in case someone was wearing
		what she had on that day." Alex finished and Sydney's eyes shot wide open in
		disbelief.</p>

		<p>"You have GOT to be kidding me."</p>

		<p>"I wish I was, but that isn't even the horrible part."</p>

		<p>"Oh God, there is more?" Sydney groaned. </p>

		<p>"Yeah, so brace yourself." Alex giggled.</p>

		<p>"OK." Sydney said while smiling as she gripped onto the dashboard.</p>

		<p>"OK, one day I was in the commons area and I was near the
		phones. I saw Jordan on the phone and she was starting to raise her voice. Well, being the
		nosy body that I am, I slowly walked over to the phone next to her and pretended to use
		it. You know, just so I could listen." Alex paused and Sydney nodded in
		acknowledgment. "So anyway, she was talking to her mother and she was bitching about
		the fact that someone had on the same outfit she had on. Well, her mother said to change
		into her other outfit. Jordan said that she had done that already, and it was her second
		outfit that this person was wearing. So she asked her mother to bring her a THIRD outfit
		so she could change."</p>

		<p>"OH MY GOD!!!!! My mother would have laughed at me and hung up the phone."</p>

		<p>"Yeah no shit, so guess what?"</p>

		<p>"I am afraid to know anymore." Sydney replied while chuckling through her hands
		that now covered her face.</p>

		<p>"Well you guessed it, her mother came to school and dropped off another outfit for
		"Miss Priss" to wear!"</p>

		<p>"I cannot believe that!!"</p>

		<p>"Yeah well, believe it, because it's true. And I think she bitched at her mom because
		it was wrinkled or some shit, and her mom apologized and promised to take her out to the
		mall after school."</p>

		<p>"Jesus!! That is exactly what I am talking about! You are so lucky that you didn't
		turn out that way. I may have had to kill you."</p>

		<p>"Believe me, I would have killed myself." Alex agreed and slowed the car into
		the parking space.</p>

		<p>Alex and Sydney got out of the car and walked to the brick path
		just short of the sand leading to the water. They stood next to each other just admiring
		the view. The sun had begun its descent leaving a beautiful trail of color it's wake. The
		water glistened with the light of the upcoming night's sky. It was truly a sight to
		behold. Alex had never seen a sky like this one. She felt as if it were smiling upon her.
		She felt a warm calm wash over her and goosebumps trail up her arms. She took in a sharp
		breath of air and suddenly tears began to roll down her cheeks. Alex smiled into the sky
		knowing her parents were the cause of this phenomenon. Sydney looked away from the view
		and saw Alex weeping and wrapped her arms around her.</p>

		<p>"What's wrong baby?" Sydney asked as she kissed the top
		of Alex's head.</p>

		<p>Sniffling, "Sydney, I just felt my parents surround me. It
		was like all of a sudden I couldn't breathe, and I felt a warmth run through me. Then I
		took in a quick breath and I could faintly smell them. God, it probably happened in like
		two seconds, but my God Sydney, I know it was them." Alex sobbed into Syd's embrace.</p>

		<p>"The people who love you will always be with you Alexandra.
		Death doesn't even stop that; at least <b>I </b>don't think so. I believe in souls, I
		believe in angels, and I do believe that you are watched by loved ones who have died. That
		doesn't surprise me that you felt them. You must have fond memories of the beach with your
		folks." Syd said as she stroked Alex's hair with her fingers.</p>

		<p>"I do. They used to take me here every weekend in the summers. I would swim, and mom
		would help me build sandcastles, and then dad would let us bury him occasionally. They
		were the sweetest people Syd. My mom was the most wonderful woman that I have ever known.
		I could only dream of being the mother she was." </p>

		<p>"Alexandra, you have the biggest heart I have ever seen. There is no doubt in my
		mind, that if you have children, you would be a wonderful mother. I feel lucky to have met
		you Alexandra. There aren't many hearts like yours. I feel honored that you chose to share
		some of it with me." Syd reassured. </p>

		<p>Alex looked up into the deep pools of blue and felt the love pass
		through them. Sydney had to fight back the tears threatening to blow her cool exterior.
		She tightened her hold on Alex and felt the woman reciprocate. Alex kept her head resting
		on Sydney's chest. Sydney hoped that Alex didn't hear her racing heartbeat. She was so
		scared with her feelings towards Alex. She loved this woman with her entire being, and she
		was going to tell her tonight.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tracy and Edna were racing around the kitchen finding bowls and
		such for the caterers. The food came on time and so did most of the guests. The family
		room was filled with people who loved Alex, or maybe some that just liked her a whole lot.
		There were people she hadn't seen in a long while; some before her parents died. Tracey
		could not wait for her friends to arrive. Tracey was a wreck; she wanted everything to go
		well. She wanted her friend to have the best birthday ever. Edna just sat and watched as
		Tracey continued her running from room to room making sure everything was perfect.</p>

		<p>"If anyone sees headlights, let me know. Everyone is here
		except for Alex and Sydney. So shush everyone when they arrive." Everyone looked at
		the crazed woman and smiled. Tracey continued to run around double and triple checking
		everything making sure that nothing was left undone before they arrived. The house was
		ready for Alex. She was going to have the best party ever if Tracey had any say in this
		matter at all.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney continued to hold Alex as the rest of the daylight was
		engulfed into the lake. She knew tonight was going to be something special, but she
		couldn't erase the fact that Sharon was around. She didn't like the fact that she was
		here. Business or not, she hoped that she was leaving shortly. 'How does she know about
		Alexandra? How does she know of her parents' death? She had just better stay away from
		her. I don't think I would be responsible for my actions if she ever tried to hurt her.
		She is a selfish, money hungry whore that knows nothing of the value of the human heart.
		Especially a heart like Alexandra's. She just better stay away.' Sydney's body stiffened
		while thinking about Sharon. Alexandra looked up at her lover with concerned eyes.</p>

		<p>"What is it honey? You seem very uncomfortable. Are you
		okay?" Alex asked.</p>

		<p>"I, ah, I was just thinking baby, I'm sorry. I was thinking
		of my past and how lucky I am to have you. Sometimes I look back at the person I was and
		then I look at you, and wonder if I really deserve you."</p>

		<p>Alex straightened herself in Sydney's hold and held Sydney's shoulders to gain her full
		attention.</p>

		<p>"Now you look here Sydney Thompson. Don't you ever let me
		hear that out of your mouth again. You deserve to be happy and to be loved by someone.
		Everyone deserves some kind of happiness in life. If I can be the one to give you that
		love and happiness, then I am going to do just that. Why would you say something like
		that?"</p>

		<p>Sydney just shrugged, "I guess I am waiting for all of this
		to blow up one way or another. I have never felt for anyone the way I feel for you
		Alexandra. I never thought I was worthy of such a gift. The last woman I was
		with......." Sydney stopped not wanting to bring all of this up on Alex's birthday
		night.</p>

		<p>"Come on Sydney, I know you are holding something back from
		me. You have to know by now that you can tell me anything." She looked up into
		troubled blue eyes. "And I know you feel you will shatter me with whatever it is that
		you are keeping to yourself, but please know that whatever it is, we will get through it,
		I promise you." She pleaded with Sydney for her to understand.</p>

		<p>"Don't make promises you can't keep Alexandra."</p>

		<p>"I have never made a promise to you that I didn't keep. I never intend to break any
		promise that I have made to you, ever."</p>

		<p>"Alright then, I will tell you as much as I can for right now okay?"</p>

		<p>"Whatever you would like to share is all that I ask Sydney. I just want to help you
		with these demons that seem to be plaguing you."</p>

		<p>"You are such a find Alexandra, I can't tell you that enough."</p>

		<p>Alex hugged Sydney one more time and they walked to a nearby bench to sit and bear souls.
		Sydney really didn't want to spoil Alex's evening, but to deny this woman anything was
		something that Sydney didn't want to do, ever.</p>

		<p>Sydney took a deep breath and started to tell her tale of woe.</p>

		<p>"Well, many years ago as you know, my parents died.
		Something that I didn't mention to you was that I had a brother."</p>

		<p>"Tim? Sydney you have told me so much about Tim."</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, if I tell you this, it will be much easier to just say it, and have you
		ask questions later, is that alright?"</p>

		<p>"OK honey, I am sorry. Please continue."</p>

		<p>"Tim is my brother, yes, but I had another brother, Billy, who died about two years
		after my dad did." She paused to see the sadness in Alex's eyes. It was a sadness for
		Sydney that Alex felt. 'Why did she feel the need to keep this from me?' Alex thought. It
		was something she would ask when she was indeed finished.</p>

		<p>"Anyway I was an angry person after my dad passed away. I
		didn't understand why people that we loved had to leave us. It didn't make sense to me and
		I became very angry and I hung out with a bad bunch of people. They made me feel like I
		belonged to something, we could do anything, we were in control, nothing could hurt us. I
		guess I needed that reassurance that I would never be out of control again. This I could
		handle, and no one was going to take that from me. If there were people out there that
		challenged us and the way we thought, well we would just change their minds. I'm sure you
		know that it wasn't peaceful negotiations that took place." Sydney stopped to
		register Alex's reaction to her admission. Alex just studied Sydney's face and wondered
		how she changed so much in ten years.</p>

		<p>"Anyway, like I said I was a very angry person back then.
		When Billy died I turned into something even worse. I was my own enemy. Everything I
		touched, everything I loved was leaving me and I only knew of one thing to release the
		pain that I felt. It was pure violence. Everything that I did was nothing short of
		psychotic. I didn't know of the person that I used to be. I just became this thing that
		destroyed or abused anything or anyone that got in my way of thinking or feeling or doing.
		Then when my mom died it finally hit me; I had no control of anything. All the people that
		I had hurt it was all for nothing. So I guess it was at that time when I finally realized
		that all I had done for the past four years was become a stupid, worthless bully. I had no
		self respect anymore. I didn't like the person I had become. It was truly time for a life
		make-over. So that is when I made up with my brother and decided to go to University and
		work on the sheep station." Sydney paused to let Alex soak in everything she had told
		her. She knew that she needed to keep going on her tale, but she just wasn't sure if she
		could muster the courage.</p>

		<p>"Sydney? May I say something?" Alex said as she looked
		at the pained face of her lover.</p>

		<p>"Of course sweetheart, I think I would really like it if you
		would." She said as she gave a half smile, unsure of what Alex would say after what
		she had just heard.</p>

		<p>"I know you think you probably just dropped a huge bomb on
		me and now is the time when I will just run for cover. Well let me reassure you again,
		that I love you. I know it's hard for you to hear that, but honey, I can't not say it to
		you. I have never loved anyone the way I love you. You make me a whole person. In a sense
		you complete me. I know that there is more to your story, and I will listen to every word
		you speak, but please know that I will never stop loving you." </p>

		<p>Alex stopped to brush the fresh tears that were falling freely
		now down Sydney's cheeks. She took her face in her hands and looked her square in her
		swollen eyes. "I love you Sydney." She finished her statement and sealed it with
		a soul binding kiss. "Know that I will always love you. You don't have to keep
		anything from me. In fact I would prefer that you didn't, but I know that you are hurting
		from something, and if you can't tell me now, I do trust you enough to know that one day
		you will. Now if you want, you can keep going with your story. If you would like to stop
		now you can. I just want you to know that I don't want to push any of this out of you
		unwillingly. Whenever you are ready to tell me the rest, please do. OK?"</p>

		<p>"Alexandra...you are the most extraordinary woman I have ever met. I don't think I
		will ever meet anyone like you. You are such a gift to me. Thank you. Thank you for loving
		me." She said as she wiped the rest of the tears that had fallen down her face. She
		took a deep breath and continued her story. "At the University I met a woman named
		Sharon Harris. She was the first person that I thought truly accepted the dark side that I
		had possessed for so long. She and I became close friends. She would share stories of her
		life in the States with me, and I told her about my past. Mine of course were scary tales
		of angst and rage and death, while hers were nothing like that. She never flinched with
		any of the tales that I told. She would just listen, occasionally she would hold my hand
		if any of the stories would get ugly, which they usually did. She was the most comfort I
		had had in almost five years. Tim and I were not close for awhile, but that was my fault.
		After mom died, we finally reconnected. After all, we were what was left of our family, so
		we had no choice but to find each other again. He had gotten married, but it was still
		nice to have my brother back. Anyway, about Sharon...God I hate thinking about her."
		She paused and took a deep breath. "Sharon was a beautiful woman, she was tall, lean,
		and blonde. She had the darkest eyes I had ever seen. She was everything I thought I was
		looking for in a partner. God I was so wrong. She and I became lovers. We did everything
		together. I told her everything about me and still she stayed, so I thought I had found
		gold. Well I found fool's gold Alexandra, and boy did I find that out the hard way.</p>

		<p>"She asked me to move to the States with her after the
		school year had ended. God I think I was about nineteen at the time. I was so in love, or
		so I thought, that I couldn't think of doing anything or being with anyone else. I told my
		brother about selling the sheep station, and he thankfully, wanted to keep it going.
		That's when I packed up my life in Sydney and moved it to Montana with her. We stayed
		together for about three years I think it was. One night, she had called me from the
		office. She said she had a project that she had to finish. It was gonna take a few hours
		so she was gonna be late getting home. Silly me started to feel bad for her." She
		painfully chuckled. "So I packed us a dinner picnic. I got some stuff together and
		put it in a basket and took it to her office." Sydney paused to gain control in her
		voice. It had begun to quiver as she started talking about that night. She regained her
		breathing and started again.</p>

		<p>"I walked into her office and there she was at her desk.
		Well I should say, on her desk, having sex with her secretary, <i>Tina.</i> Isn't that the
		oldest clich&#142; in the book? She didn't even stop until she had a fucking orgasm. She
		then preceded to tell me that I was a prize to her. A beautiful trophy that she could come
		home to or she could be on my arm whenever we went to a bar or something. I was something
		that she could show off. I was a fucking possession of hers. She had so many affairs
		behind my back. All of her compassion for me was just a lie. She didn't give a shit one
		way or another for me. She liked my money and she liked the way I looked. Obviously I was
		lacking in the sex department since she had sex with anyone she could get her fingers
		into. Although she seemed to like it rough, or so she said the other day...."</p>

		<p>"The other day!! Sydney when did you see her?" Alex almost shouted in disbelief.</p>

		<p>"She approached me when I was in the restroom at the
		restaurant last week."</p>

		<p>"Why didn't you say anything? God, no wonder you were so upset when you came
		back."</p>

		<p>"I didn't say anything because I didn't want you to worry.
		You have had so much on your mind, this would have only added to it. She handed me a towel
		after I had washed my face and I literally almost killed her Alexandra. She brings out an
		anger in me, I didn't know I had."</p>

		<p>"What happened Sydney? Did she threaten you?"</p>

		<p>"More like I threatened her. She made mention to finding out who you were, and I
		guess I just lost it. Alexandra, I can't even tell you how much I wanted to hurt her after
		she mentioned your name and her own in the same sentence. Somehow she found out about you
		and the fact that your parents were killed. I just don't know how she did it, unless she
		has been following me. She said she was here on business for her father's company, but
		still. It really freaked me out to see her after all this time."</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, I am so sorry. God, I wish you would have told me. I don't want you to
		ever go through anything like that alone again. Do you understand me? I want you to
		promise that you will ask for help if you need it. If something is bothering you, I want
		to know about it. Are we clear about this? We are in this together!" Alex said
		sternly but with so much love in her voice.</p>

		<p>"Yes Alexandra, I understand. Thank you for your concern. It
		means the world to me."</p>

		<p>"OK, I am sorry, I didn't mean to jump in like that, but damn Sydney, that really
		threw me to hear that you had seen her, and here, of all places!! I hope to God that I
		never meet this woman Sydney. I swear to everything Holy, that I will punch her lights
		out."</p>

		<p>"My hero." Sydney chuckled and kissed Alex on the top of her head. "So to
		finish this damn thing, I left her that night. I told her I didn't want to be found by her
		and that she shouldn't come home until the next day. I stayed with some friends until one
		of them told me about Edna needing a stable hand. I had worked with horses before so I
		knew what kind of work would be involved. I called your aunt and we had a great talk. I
		came to the ranch and she showed me around. I loved it there and I really took a liking to
		Edna. She took me in and the rest as you say, is history. She is the dearest friend that I
		have ever had. She always knew what to say to make me feel better; she still has that
		wonderful quality. This is my third year there, and I couldn't think of any place else I
		would rather be." Sydney smiled down at Alex.</p>

		<p>"What about Australia?"</p>

		<p>"Oh I miss home, there is no question about that. I even contemplated moving back
		after what had happened. There were just so many bad memories there for me, that I thought
		I just needed a fresh start. Sure it didn't start out great in the States either, but I
		was already here, and Edna entered my life. It seemed like it was meant to be. How else do
		you explain me meeting the woman of my dreams?"</p>

		<p>"The woman of your dreams?" Alex shyly asked.</p>

		<p>"You, Alexandra." Sydney shifted in her seat to face
		Alex. She caressed Alex's face with her hand. "I love you Alexandra. I love you more
		than anything I have ever known. That scares the hell out of me, but it's time that you
		know that I am in this for the long haul. I swore to myself that I would never love anyone
		again, but you showed me a love that I have never seen before. I know that heart of yours
		doesn't have a mean streak in it. I know that my heart is safe with you. You have owned it
		since we met at the stables the day you arrived at the ranch. I love you Alexandra with
		all of my heart." </p>

		<p>Alex began to weep when she finally let it sink in that Sydney
		did in fact love her and now she was finally voicing it. Sydney reached into her pocket
		and pulled out a small velvet box. She took it with shaky hands and held it before Alex.</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, I want you to have this. Although it scares me
		senseless, I want you to be with me forever. However long forever is, I want you to share
		your life with me. Please accept this gift and know that you encircle my heart with every
		breath that I take. I love you Alexandra." Sydney said as fresh tears streamed down
		her face.</p>

		<p>Alex opened the box to find the ring that Sydney had picked out
		earlier that morning. "Oh Sydney, this is beautiful!"</p>

		<p>"Look in the inside of it." </p>

		<p>"Ooh, an inscription...<i>Always, Sydney</i>." Alex put
		the ring on and brought her hand to Sydney's heart. "I love you too Sydney. Thank you
		so much."</p>

		<p>"Happy Birthday baby."</p>

		<p>The two just held onto each other as the waves of sobs passed and
		resurfaced over and over. Their trip to the beach had lasted well over her time limit and
		Sydney knew that she had to get Alex back to the house. There were festivities awaiting
		them in Alex's honor, and a very nervous wreck named Tracey.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>The ride from the beach was filled with tender kisses and
		touches. Syd had never felt so loved in her life. The love that she thought she had with
		Sharon was nothing in comparison to what she had with Alex. She felt like the luckiest
		woman in the world. Her fears were melting with every minute she spent with Alex. Giving
		her the ring was such a cleansing for her soul. 'I could fly right now if she asked me
		to.' She thought to herself. There was only one thing left to tell Alex about her
		checkered past, and that indeed, could wait for another time. 'I don't want to spoil her
		entire evening. Besides, she may not be as accepting as she was earlier.' Syd thought as
		she stared at the profile of her companion.</p>

		<p>"What's on your mind Sydney?" Alex asked.</p>

		<p>"Mmm, you baby. I am so happy right now. Nothing could
		possibly ruin this night for us." Syd happily said.</p>

		<p>"I agree. It has been the best birthday that I have ever
		had. Thank you Sydney, for so much. You have been so good for me. You helped me more than
		you know. If you hadn't been around, I may have just withered away into nothingness after
		my parents died. I didn't know what or how to feel, or even if I could feel loved or give
		love again. You have healed my heart Sydney, I can't thank you enough for that." Alex
		said as she squeezed Sydney's hand.</p>

		<p>"You don't have to thank me Honey, you have been just as important in my own healing.
		I never wanted to love again. Love was the equivalent of pain for me, and you smashed
		right through that wall. I saw your heart from the very beginning and knew that mine would
		be safe with you. You have no idea what that means to me."</p>

		<p>"Yes I do. I can understand completely. We helped each other while helping the other,
		if that makes any sense whatsoever."</p>

		<p>"It does sweetheart, it truly does." She paused to look at Alex. "I think
		it's a good idea that we go back to the house and check to see if Tracey called. I know
		she wouldn't want to miss your birthday."</p>

		<p>"Well, I know she has Char in town for only a couple more days, so she may be
		preoccupied."</p>

		<p>"But you are her best friend Alexandra. Surely you'd think she would celebrate that
		with you."</p>

		<p>"I can hope. She is just so smitten with this one. I have never seen her so over the
		edge for anyone. This girl had better not break her heart, otherwise, she will have me to
		deal with."</p>

		<p>"Remind me never to break Tracey's heart. I don't ever want to feel your wrath."</p>

		<p>They chuckled as they pulled into the driveway of Alex's house. Sydney had to really try
		to keep her emotions in check. She couldn't wait to see Alex's face when she walked into
		the house.</p>

		<p>Sydney walked around the car and opened the door for Alex. She
		took her hand and walked together towards the house.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"They are here!" Tracey shouted to the crowded family room. "No one makes a
		sound!" She peeked again outside and saw the two women walking towards the front
		door. "When they walk into the room and switch on the light, shout surprise, but wait
		until she walks in here, don't shout it to the foyer!" She insisted.</p>

		<p>Everyone rolled their eyes at their spastic friend, but nodded
		their acceptance of her orders. Edna just smiled to herself as she eyed the doorway her
		niece was going to walk through shortly.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Sydney, I can open the door, sheesh. I know it's my
		birthday, but I can open a door for myself. Hey why is it so dark in here? Didn't I leave
		a light on?"</p>

		<p>"I guess we forgot. I can get the one in the family room. I think I remember where
		all the lamps are."</p>

		<p>"Oh no you don't. They are going to end up on the floor if you start feeling your way
		around. Let me."</p>

		<p>"Have it your way." Syd said to a smiling Alex.</p>

		<p>*Click*</p>

		<p>"SURPRISE!!!!!!!" The room shouted at a very startled
		Alex. "HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALEX!!!!!" They shouted again.</p>

		<p>Tracey came rushing at Alex with a huge grin on her face. Before
		Alex knew what hit her, she and Tracey ended up sprawled on the couch. Tracey was hugging
		and kissing her happily surprised friend.</p>

		<p>"OH...MY...GOD!!!!! Who did this?" Alex asked while
		looking up at Tracey then at a hugely grinning Sydney.</p>

		<p>"I should have guessed. I can't leave you two alone for two
		minutes." Alex laughed and managed to climb over Tracey to her feet.</p>

		<p>"Can I get a hug from my best girl?" A voice came from
		across the room. Alex turned to find Edna smiling at her.</p>

		<p>"EDDI!!!! Oh my God!!! YOU TOO???" Alex jumped and ran
		across the room to hug her aunt.</p>

		<p>"Guilty as charged, afraid to say. Happy birthday
		sweetheart."</p>

		<p>"Thanks Eddi. It means the world to me that you came." She said as tears
		threatened to leak down her cheeks. She turned into her aunt's body and again wrapped her
		arms around the stout woman. "God I can't believe you are here."</p>

		<p>"Believe it honey. I wouldn't have missed this for all the horses in Montana."</p>

		<p>"I love you Eddi." Alex said as she squeezed Edna
		again.</p>

		<p>"You too kiddo. I bet there are a lot of faces you haven't
		seen here in a while. I'll be here for a while, but I have to leave. This was a stopping
		point for me before I have to go back to Indy. They are having another auction. I just had
		to go. There is some machinery I still needed that I couldn't find this summer. I am
		hoping to get lucky tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"Aww Eddi, you can't stay for the whole party?"</p>

		<p>"It was either do it this way, or not show up. And as I said, I wouldn't have missed
		that expression of yours for anything. It was beautiful."</p>

		<p>"It sure is." A low and throaty voice came from behind Alex and arms soon
		wrapped around her waist.</p>

		<p>"Oh you...you are in so much trouble. I can't believe you
		didn't let any of this slip. I was totally surprised." Alex admitted.</p>

		<p>"Well isn't that the purpose of a surprise party?"
		Sydney sarcastically responded.</p>

		<p>"OK Smart Ass. That's enough outta you." Alex's guardian spoke.</p>

		<p>"Hey Edna, nice to see you." Sydney said as she released Alex to embrace her
		dear friend.</p>

		<p>"You too hon. I gotta hand it to you and Tracey. You
		definitely fooled this little one here."</p>

		<p>"Yep we sure did. Many ways in fact." Sydney smiled down at Alex who understood
		what Sydney was referring to. She immediately raised her ringed finger to show her aunt
		what Sydney had gotten for her.</p>

		<p>"Oh honey, that is beautiful!! I knew she had good
		taste." Edna smiled.</p>

		<p>"The best. Look who is wearing it." Sydney laughed and pecked Alex's cheek.</p>

		<p>"Hey you two, I gotta make some rounds. I gotta find Tracey
		and meet this new girlie girl of hers." Alex said excitedly.</p>

		<p>"Char isn't here yet darlin'. She said she would be here a little later. Some
		business came up or something. She should be arriving shortly." Edna explained.</p>

		<p>"Oh well, then I am going to chat with some people. There
		are faces I haven't seen in years. This is turning into a night of first's, that's for
		sure."</p>

		<p>"First's?" Sydney asked.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, first you giving me the ring. Then you telling me you
		loved me. Then this party, I haven't ever had a surprise party before. I can't even wait
		to see what the rest of the night has in store for me."</p>

		<p>"It's gonna be a night to remember baby. I can feel it." Sydney smiled.</p>

		<p>"I think you are right. Remind me to thank you properly
		later." Alex said as she reached up and held the back of Sydney's head until they
		were face to face and inches from each other. "I love you Sydney." She said as
		she pulled Sydney down for a short but passionate kiss. "It gets better...
		later." Alex promised.</p>

		<p>"I can hardly wait. I love you too baby. Go on now. I gotta
		run to Terry's and get the rest of the alcohol."</p>

		<p>"OK sweetheart. I'll see you soon." Alex stopped and turned to see a familiar
		face. "Oh my God Rita!! God I haven't seen you in ages!! How have you been?"
		Alex's voice faded and blended in with the rest of the room. Sydney just smiled and walked
		towards the door. Tracey ran up to her and planted a great big kiss on her lips. Sydney
		just looked at her awestruck and smiled a crooked grin.</p>

		<p>"Thank you Sydney. This worked out so great!! Did you see
		her face?? God she was so surprised!! This is just so great!!"</p>

		<p>"Yes, we did well. I think we really got her. So um, where is your lady?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, she should be here any minute. Are you off to the liquor store?"</p>

		<p>"Yep. I figure it's probably a good time before it gets totally hopping in here. I
		should be back in about an hour or so."</p>

		<p>"OK great. Sydney...thank you again for getting all of that taken care of."
		Tracey sincerely said.</p>

		<p>"Hey no problem, you took care of everything else. I'll see you soon." She
		smiled and opened the door.</p>

		<p>"OK Sydney, be careful, you do remember where you are going, right?" Tracey
		asked hesitantly.</p>

		<p>"Yea, I have been there before. See ya."</p>

		<p>"Byeee" Tracey sang. "OK, now it's time to partaaaayy." She screamed
		as she jumped in a dancing line. The women around her just laughed and danced with their
		happy friend as the music thumped around them. </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Dance with me babe." Tracey said as she grabbed Alex's arm and pulled her into
		the middle of the family room.</p>

		<p>"Christ! Do I have a choice?" Alex yelped.</p>

		<p>"Nope, come on." Tracey giggled as she started to sway with Alex to the bass of
		the music.</p>

		<p>The two started to get overtly sexual on the dance floor. Their
		legs were intertwined as they started their decent to the floor and back up again. Their
		hips were gyrating with the rhythm and their arms were flailing above them. They looked at
		each other and broke into a fit of laughter as the song ended.</p>

		<p>"Should I be jealous?" A voice came from behind Tracey.
		Alex looked into deep brown eyes and smiled.</p>

		<p>"You must be Char. I am Alex, no need for worry here. We
		agreed a long time ago that we were best as friends and nothing more." She extended
		her hand to Char and they exchanged a jovial meeting.</p>

		<p>"That's a relief. Hi honey, I finally made it." She
		directed her gaze at Tracey.</p>

		<p>"Hi sweets, I'm glad you got here. This is my best friend in
		the whole world." She said as she hugged and kissed the top of Alex's head.</p>

		<p>"Nice to finally meet you Alex. Oh and Happy Birthday. Sorry
		I missed the surprise, but I had some things to tend to before I was able to get
		here."</p>

		<p>"That's OK. I am just glad that I got a chance to meet you as well. Tracey has said
		so many wonderful things about you. I couldn't wait to meet you."</p>

		<p>"Likewise. I have heard nothing but great things about you and Sydney for the last
		few months. It is wonderful to see you in the flesh."</p>

		<p>"Thanks. How long are you here for?"</p>

		<p>"Only a couple more days unfortunately. I gotta get back to LA. I'm just about done
		with my business deal. I should know by tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"I see, well I hope it works out for you."</p>

		<p>"Me too. Shall we get a drink?" Char asked Tracey and Alex.</p>

		<p>"Sure, I think there is still a bit of wine left. Sydney
		went to the liquor store to get the rest of it."</p>

		<p>"Oh what a dear. To the bar then?"</p>

		<p>"Onward!" Alex said as she raised her fist. She walked arm in arm with Tracey
		and Char.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"God I hope I went the right way....oh here it is. Thank God. That's all Alexandra
		needs is to get a smoke signal from me because I got lost." Sydney rambled to
		herself.</p>

		<p>She stepped out of the car and walked into Terry's Liquor's and
		waited in line. She approached the counter and watched as a young man's eyes popped out of
		his head as he stared at her.</p>

		<p>"Are you all right?" She teasingly asked.</p>

		<p>"Uhh, y...yeah. Can I help you?" The tongue tied clerk
		asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes. I am Sydney Thompson. I called a few days back with an
		order for a keg of beer and some other things."</p>

		<p>"Riiiight, um, let me go in back and make sure we got it all together." He said
		before he practically ran into the stockroom.</p>

		<p>"God if he is twenty-one I'll be surprised." She mused
		to herself.</p>

		<p>"Hey little lady. What does a fine thing like you need with
		so much booze? You needing to share it with anyone?"</p>

		<p>"Excuse me?" Sydney asked incredulously.</p>

		<p>"I said...." He started to drool a bit as he was
		swaying from foot to foot. "Do you need some company to help you drink all
		that?"</p>

		<p>"No thank you." Sydney noticed that a policeman had entered the store and she
		motioned for him to come closer. "Hey bud, did you drive here?" She asked the
		obviously inebriated man.</p>

		<p>"Of course I did, that's my ride right out front, do you
		want me to show it to ya? I could take us somewheres more private."</p>

		<p>"No that's OK, I'm sure you'll be quite busy the rest of the night." She
		chuckled as the police officer made his presence known.</p>

		<p>Sydney amused herself by watching the drunken idiot try to walk
		out of the liquor store towards his car. The officer followed him out and waited for him
		to get in his car. When he closed the door and pulled out his keys, the officer appeared
		at his window with his partner, and asked man to get out of the car. The drunken man
		started swearing at the officers and was getting very excited. The man was given a test
		that he failed miserably and was soon being read his Miranda's. They handcuffed him and
		placed him in the back of the black and white. The initial officer walked into the liquor
		store and approached Sydney.</p>

		<p>"Thanks Miss. I appreciate you giving me the heads up with
		that one. I'm surprised that he didn't kill himself or someone else on the way here."</p>

		<p>"That's no problem. A good friend of mine lost her parents
		to someone like him. I couldn't let that happen again to someone else's loved one."
		Sydney explained.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry to hear that. If more people like you made it
		their business to help, we may not have as many fatalities as we do. Thanks again, I do
		appreciate it." The officer smiled a bright teethy grin at Sydney.</p>

		<p>"It was the least I could do. Have fun with that one."
		She shook his hand and gestured to the idiot screaming in the back seat of the squad.</p>

		<p>"Oh we will. Have a good night now."</p>

		<p>"I will. Goodnight." She watched the squad pull out of the parking lot. She
		decided to find the little salesman and find out what was taking so damn long with her
		order.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me?" She said as she knocked on the backdoor.
		The same man exited the door.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry ma'am. I'm just uhh, well I can't get the keg out
		of the back, and I'm alone in here..." Sydney stopped the kid in mid panic.</p>

		<p>"Where is it?"</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"Show me where it is and I will help you."</p>

		<p>"Ma'am you won't be able to lift it. It is really very heavy." The boy
		explained.</p>

		<p>"Just point me in the right direction. I assure you I can
		help. If I can hog tie farm animals, I certainly can roll a keg out here."</p>

		<p>"Uhh, this way." He led Sydney into the refrigerated locker. She easily got the
		keg from it's resting spot as the young man looked on in awe. She put the keg on a two
		wheel cart and wheeled it out into the front of the store.</p>

		<p>"Now if you can get the rest of my order together I may have
		enough time to enjoy my girlfriend's surprise party." Sydney deadpanned.</p>

		<p>The young clerk just stared at her. "Tonight would be
		good." She broke him out of his reverie.</p>

		<p>"Yes...yes....sorry. I just...nevermind... I'll be right up
		with the rest of your order." He said as he scurried into the back again.</p>

		<p>After a few minutes the young clerk returned from the abyss with
		the rest of her supplies on her list.</p>

		<p>"I think this just about covers it. You do know that you
		need to put a deposit on the tapper for the keg?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, I was informed of that. You do take cash I assume?" She said as she raised
		a quizzical eyebrow at him.</p>

		<p>"Of course." He blushed. "I'm sorry, I have been a little out of it."
		He bashfully admitted.</p>

		<p>"It's alright. Now, if you can carry the bags and the tub to the car for me, I will
		handle the keg." She smiled her brightest smile at him. He jumbled the bags but
		agreed to help. 'This poor kid needs to get laid, and fast.' She mused to herself as she
		rolled the keg to her car and placed it in her back seat. The clerk placed the rest of the
		bags in her trunk with a few extra bags of ice "on the house".</p>

		<p>"Thank you for your help umm," She stopped and looked
		at his nametag. "Jimmy. You've been most helpful."</p>

		<p>"Sure miss, anytime. Uhh, have a good time at your umm, party." He stumbled out.</p>

		<p>"Thanks, my girlfriend thanks you too. Bye now." She
		said as she waved to him out her window and pulled out of the parking lot back towards
		Alex's house. </p>

		<p>"My God, she has got to be the most stunning woman I have
		ever met." The young man said out loud to no one in particular. He turned and walked
		back into the store while looking back over his shoulder for one last look.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex was so happy. This was the best birthday that she could
		remember having. She had never had a surprise party before. Her parents would occasionally
		throw her a party for her birthday, but never a surprise one. She was really happy for
		Tracey too. She had never seen her so happy before. 'This girl may just be the one.' Alex
		thought to herself as she watched the interaction of the two women.</p>

		<p>"Hey Tracey? How long did Syd say she'd be? I'm starting to
		worry." Alex questioned.</p>

		<p>"Oh darlin, she'll be fine. She said she would be about an
		hour. It's almost that time now. Don't worry she'll be fine, hon." Tracey reassured
		her friend.</p>

		<p>"You're right. I am just being a worry wart. You are going
		to love Sydney Char, she is just the best!"</p>

		<p>"Oh, don't you worry. She and I will certainly have a spectacular conversation. You
		just wait." She smiled victoriously.</p>

		<p>"Well good. I know she has been looking forward to meeting
		you, as I have." Alex smiled.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, the feeling is mutual." Char said with a
		smile.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney drove up the driveway to Alex's house and saw the people
		dancing through the main window. A smile came to her lips as she saw Alex and Tracey
		dancing together.</p>

		<p>"She is just too damn cute. It looks like she is having a
		great time." She said outloud as she put the car into the garage. She walked around
		to the trunk, pulled out the bags from the liquor store, and headed up to the house. She
		opened the front door and walked towards the kitchen. She grabbed one of Alex's friends
		and asked him to help her with the keg. </p>

		<p>"Sure, does that mean I get first pull from it?" A very
		thirsty Josh asked.</p>

		<p>"Sure cowboy, if you can tap this sucker, it's all yours." She smiled at him.</p>

		<p>"Cool, I'm on it." He said as he grabbed the half
		barrel out of the backseat. Sydney wheeled a hand cart towards him and he just scoffed at
		her.</p>

		<p>"I don't need that, just hold the doors for me."</p>

		<p>"Alright studly, I'll lead the way." She winked at the young man as she watched
		his facial expressions reach the crimson stage. "Are you sure you don't want the
		cart?"</p>

		<p>"You know, I got this um, football injury and uh, it might be a good idea if I use
		that thing." He stammered out.</p>

		<p>"Sure, you're probably right. You don't want to aggravate
		your injury." She said while holding back a chuckle. "C'Mon, we'll get this set
		up in the bar area."</p>

		<p>"OK, lead the way." An embarrassed Josh replied.</p>

		<p>Sydney and Josh wheeled the keg into the bar. She poured several
		bags of ice into the tub and watched as Josh tried to lift the keg alone. She handed him
		the tapper and together they lifted the keg into the tub of ice. Josh successfully tapped
		the keg and a line soon formed around that area. Alex was still dancing with Tracey so
		Sydney decided to go into the kitchen and grab one of the bottles of champagne for her
		birthday girl. Sharon watched menacingly as Sydney walked into the kitchen.</p>

		<p>"It's showtime...." Sharon said to herself.</p>

		<p>Sydney had her back to the doorway leading from the kitchen to
		the family room. She was trying to open the bottle of Martini and Rossi Champagne she had
		bought for Alex, Tracey and her new girlfriend, Char. She thought a toast would certainly
		be in order for this evening. </p>

		<p>Alex got a glance of Sydney walking into the kitchen. She broke
		free from Tracey's dancing arms and headed towards the kitchen. "Hey Trace, Sydney
		just got back. I'll be back in a sec."</p>

		<p>"OK hon. Hey if you see Char, tell her she owes me a dance
		all right?" Tracey asked.</p>

		<p>"Sure babe." Alex replied. She saw Char follow Sydney
		into the kitchen and realized that Sydney had yet to meet her. 'She is gonna love her!'
		She thought to herself. She picked up her pace so she could introduce the two women.</p>

		<p>Sydney popped the champagne cork from it's bottle and heard some
		people approaching. Char was standing behind Sydney in the kitchen as Alex walked in.</p>

		<p>"Hey honey, I want to introduce you to someone." Sydney
		heard Alex say.</p>

		<p>Sydney turned around as if in slow motion, only to look into the
		eyes of her ex-lover and dropped the bottle of champagne on the floor. The bottle crashed
		to the floor and glass particles were shattered everywhere.</p>

		<p>"Sharon." Sydney said through gritted teeth.</p>

		<p>"Hello Sydney. Long time no see." Sharon smirked.</p>

		<p>"Not long enough for me." Sydney retorted.</p>

		<p>Alex's jaw dropped as she heard the exchange between the two.</p>

		<p>"Sharon?" Alex whispered. </p>

		<p>Sharon and Sydney turned to face Alex. Sydney's face was pale and
		drawn whereas Sharon's was flushed with excitement. Alex looked at them with so much
		confusion on her face.</p>

		<p>"What do you mean? Sydney this is Char, Tracey's
		girlfriend."</p>

		<p>"No Alexandra, this is Sharon Harris." Sydney corrected.</p>

		<p>"What?!" Alex said disbelievingly. She suddenly found a rage building within
		her. She turned and got in Sharon's face. "You've got about five seconds to tell me
		why I shouldn't call the police and have them arrest you for trespassing."</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, you didn't tell me she had such spirit. I would have looked her up her
		sooner." Sharon chuckled as she stared at Alex's infuriated face.</p>

		<p>"Don't you even think about it Sharon." Sydney warned.</p>

		<p>"Oh don't worry Sydney, it's not her I am after. I came back
		to claim what you took from me." Sharon turned to face Sydney.</p>

		<p>"And what did I EVER take from you?" Sydney spat at
		Sharon.</p>

		<p>"You my darling. I came back for you."</p>

		<p>"You have GOT to be kidding me. I wouldn't go back to you for anything in this
		world." Sydney shot back.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, don't you remember how good we were together? We
		can have that again Sydney. Just come with me and let's start our life over again."
		Sharon quietly spoke until she felt Alex grab her arm.</p>

		<p>"Look here Miss 'I-Lie-To-Everyone-About-My-Identity' Sydney
		is with me. She will ALWAYS be with me. There is nothing that you could say that will
		change that. What about poor Tracey? She has no idea of the lies you have fed to her. You
		are going to break her heart. But I guess someone that doesn't HAVE a heart wouldn't know
		what it feels like to have theirs broken." Alex paused to look into Sharon's
		unfeeling eyes. "Now, I am going to ask you nicely one last time to leave my house.
		After that, I can't guarantee how it will come out!" Alex shouted.</p>

		<p>"Oh I think there is definitely something that I could say
		that would change Sydney's mind." Sharon threatened.</p>

		<p>"Sharon, don't you dare." Sydney warned.</p>

		<p>"What's the matter Sydney? Are you afraid to tell your lover
		the truth? Afraid that she will see the monster you used to be? Or maybe you are still
		that person underneath that new exterior of yours." Sharon taunted. Sydney grabbed
		Sharon by her shoulders and put her face within inches of hers.</p>

		<p>"Don't you dare say one word about my past. I have paid for
		everything that happened in that time. You of all people should know that!" She
		screamed as she tightened her grip around Sharon.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, how I've missed your arms around me. Don't think that I won't fight to
		have them back on a full time basis." Sharon smiled.</p>

		<p>"What the hell does that mean? You will have to fight until
		hell freezes Sharon. Our time together is over!" Sydney said as she walked towards
		Alex.</p>

		<p>"Oh no no no, my dearest. Our time is just beginning."
		She paused and looked at Alex. "Alexandra? Has she told you about her brother
		Billy?" Sydney whirled around and grabbed Sharon by the throat.</p>

		<p>"Shut the fuck up Sharon, I'm warning you. You say one word
		disgracing my brother and I will kill you where you stand! Do you hear me!!!" Sydney
		shouted.</p>

		<p>"God I have missed that fire. Remember how you used to take
		me after your nightmares Sydney? Those dreams you had would wake you so abruptly. You were
		so filled with angst and rage. I could ease your pain with a few acts of passion. Do you
		remember that, Sydney? We could have that again, just say the word." Sharon continued
		to taunt as Sydney began to squeeze her neck harder.</p>

		<p>"Sydney, please...let her down." A soft voice entered
		Sydney's ears and she realized that Sharon was dangling under her grip. She slowly let her
		down and felt Alex's hand on the small of her back. One movement sent a calming sensation
		throughout her entire body.</p>

		<p>"I'm so sorry." Sydney whispered to Alex.</p>

		<p>Alex took Sydney's hand and walked her a few feet away from a
		gasping and coughing Sharon.</p>

		<p>"Sydney, what am I going to tell Tracey? I think she is in
		love with her. This is going to kill her."</p>

		<p>"There is nothing that we can say that is going to lessen
		the blow from this one. She is an uncaring bitch that doesn't care who she hurts, as long
		as she gets what she wants." Sydney commented.</p>

		<p>"Sydney, is there more to your story about Billy that I need
		to know about? I would much rather hear it from you than her." Alex asked quietly.</p>

		<p>"Yes there is. I wish I would have told you the whole story,
		but I didn't want to upset you on your birthday. If you just go with the flow and pretend,
		just this once for me, I will tell you everything. I can guarantee she is going to say it
		just to upset me. Please know that I love you, and whatever she may say, might not be the
		truth. So if you are confused or terrified by what may come out of her mouth, I'm sorry. I
		only didn't tell you because of everything you have gone through." Sydney tried to
		explain.</p>

		<p>"What does that mean Sydney? I don't understand. With what I
		have gone through? What could have been in your past that would upset me now? I don't get
		it."</p>

		<p>"What she means, brat, is that you lost your parents to someone like her. She killed
		her own brother. It was her fault that he died. Isn't that right Sydney?" Sharon
		triumphantly stated.</p>

		<p>"What?" Was all Alex could breathe out.</p>

		<p>"YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED!! You know I blamed
		myself for the longest time for Billy's death. It's not true!" Sydney defended. She
		looked into Alex's eyes and could only read fear and confusion.</p>

		<p>"Yes it is Sydney. You may as well have pulled the trigger
		yourself."</p>

		<p>"Shut up Sharon, I am warning you for the last time." Sydney growled.</p>

		<p>"I...I don't know what to think here." Alex stammered.
		"I've got to get out of here."</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, please. Don't go." She reached for Alex only to have her pull away.
		Alex ran out of the kitchen and went looking for Tracey and Edna.</p>

		<p>Laughing, Sharon looked at Sydney with utter amusement.</p>

		<p>"The little brat must be terrified of you now." Sharon
		chuckled.</p>

		<p>Sydney was staring at the floor listening to Sharon gloat, then
		she looked up to meet the eyes of the most heartless woman she had ever met. She swallowed
		a couple times before gaining the strength to speak coherently. She mustered a throaty one
		word whisper.</p>

		<p>"Why?" She asked.</p>

		<p>"Why not Sydney? I came back for you and I'm not leaving
		without you." Sharon stated flatly.</p>

		<p>"Why would you want to be with me? I despise you more than I
		thought capable. You may have ruined everything that Alexandra and I have built over the
		last few months." Her voice started to get louder. "What the hell did you
		possibly think I would give you after you broke my heart the way you did over three
		fucking years ago!?" She started to pace through the kitchen. "I can't believe
		you! How could you?! I want to know RIGHT NOW!" </p>

		<p>Sharon laughed in her face. Sydney growled and smashed the back
		of her left hand into Sharon's face. She grabbed Sharon by the throat again and slammed
		her against the kitchen cabinets.</p>

		<p>Sharon started to choke, "Sydney, I...can't breathe.
		Please.....let me.....go." She gagged and squirmed knocking over a bottle on the
		counter and breaking it.</p>

		<p>"Not until you tell me why? NOW TALK!!!" Sydney
		demanded as she picked up a piece of the broken bottle off of the counter. She pointed the
		jagged edge at Sharon's cheek. She rubbed the edge on Sharon's face smearing the blood
		that had run from her nose. "Tell me why you thought it necessary to ruin my life
		AGAIN!" She pushed Sharon onto the counter and lessened her grip on her throat. A few
		larger pieces of glass fell to the floor smashing into smaller pieces. She kept the glass
		against Sharon's face and demanded she talk.</p>
