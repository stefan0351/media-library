<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Twenty -->

<p>The kids lounged in bed with Gage most of the morning after the hectic day before. Lacy only left the safe and warm haven to answer the ringing telephone.</p>
		<p>"Hello." Lacy sat down on the couch, wrapping her robe around her against the chill of the morning.</p>
		<p>"Lacy, it's David." A serious tone emitted from the receiver.</p>
		<p>"I'm surprised to hear from you, David."</p>
		<p>"I bet you are." The tone changed to one of sarcasm.</p>
		<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
		<p>"Let me get straight to the point." An evil laugh erupted. "Ha, ha, straight to the point. That's a good one." David laughed at his own joke.</p>
		<p>"You've lost me."</p>
		<p>"That's what you keep saying. Listen, bab.... Lacy, you're agent called and....." The way David left his words hanging; Lacy thought she was supposed to fill in the blank.</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"And he says something funny is going on up there between you and that writer. Get the picture." Again, David laughed at his own joke. "No, I guess you haven't seen it yet."</p>
		<p>Well aware of what David was eluding to now, Lacy cut straight to the chase. "Let's get to it, David. Why did you call and just what's on your evil mind?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, now that was nasty." David feeling a surge of courage continued. "Listen, babe, if you want I'll toss the divorce papers in the trash and take ya back. But things are gonna to have to be my way."</p>
		<p>"And since when has that changed?"</p>
		<p>"Since you quit the show for one. You act like your career doesn't mean a thing anymore. We were ridin' high with that one and kaput..." He snapped his fingers. "Just like that you end it." </p>
		<p>"I will not go back to..... blindly taking your advice about my career and how to act and how much time I should have with my children." </p>
		<p>"Our children." He corrected her. "And if you still want the divorce then I get custody of the kids."</p>
		<p>"I want the divorce?" Lacy was livid. "You had the papers drawn up. It came as a total surprise to me, but, you know what, David, I do want a divorce. And, no, the kids stay with me."</p>
		<p>"You don't really want me to bring up the sorted affair you're carrying on with that writer, do you? No, it will be my way or you'll take a quick detour off a highway to nowhere. Nobody in Hollywood will hire you. Got it?"</p>
		<p>Sucking in a deep breath, Lacy willed herself to remain calm. "David, you didn't even want Derek, remember?"</p>
		<p>"Fine. I'll just take Dani." His voice dropping to a mumble. "Who knows if the kid is really mine anyway." </p>
		<p>"You son of a bitch. You would separate them, wouldn't you? And I'm sorry to say this, but Derek is yours. I don't know why you keep suggesting differently." Lacy yelled. Pulling herself in check as not to wake the kids, she regained her composure. "I'm calling my lawyer as soon as I get off the phone. You want a battle you'll get one. I'm sure having you're little girlfriend won't bode well for you." </p>
		<p>"Huh. Having a mistress is done everyday here. But, when you pull your lover out of the closet so to speak....." David couldn't help it, he laughed again.
			<i>I am just too funny. </i>"That career of yours that I had flying high is gonna fall so fast you won't know what hit you. Then you'll be begging for me to take you back." David slapped the telephone down before she could reply.
		</p>
		<p>The rest of the day was spent in relative silence. Lacy refused to talk about what soured her mood and her children were recovering from the traumatic events of the day before. Dani was particularly leery of mentioning the cave, not wanting to get in trouble from her mother.</p>
		<p>Lacy tried several times to reach her agent to find out why he would have called David, informing her soon to be ex husband about the anonymous call. She left several messages.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>After a long day of silence and having tucked the kids safely into bed for the night, Lacy revealed the contents of her call from David to Gage. Helpless to find out she was the source of Lacy's problems, Gage prayed the Calvary would arrive and it did in the form of a phone call.</p>
		<p>"Mark, hi." Gage breathed a sigh of relief. "Do you have anything for me?"</p>
		<p>"I do." Her ever-faithful friend informed her.</p>
		<p>Lacy watched from across the room as Gage spent the next twenty minutes talking with Mark Calico, her business partner. The few spurts of laughter and sincere thanks Gage offered her friend did not sit well with the actress. Even though Lacy was concerned about the potentially dangerous relationship blooming between them and how it would affect her life, her career and especially her children's lives, she couldn't help, but feel a persistent surge of jealousy ripped through her body at how easily Gage conversed with Mark. </p>
		<p>When Gage finally hung up, she turned to Lacy offering a big smile. "Great news." </p>
		<p>The expression on Lacy's face was nothing short of lackadaisical. </p>
		<p>"Okay, I'll let you be the judge of that." Gage stated. "My friend, Mark...." She read a definite frown on Lacy's face at the mention of her producing partner. "Let me back up. I called Mark a few days ago after David showed up with the divorce papers and asked him to check out a few things. Seems Ron Griffen was Mark's roommate at college."</p>
		<p>This bit of news piqued Lacy's interest somewhat.</p>
		<p>"He talked with Griffen and found out some interesting things. Like the word around the studio is that Hayston Rawlings is pregnant." Gage waited for this news to sink in.</p>
		<p>"Go on." It didn't seem to faze Lacy.</p>
		<p>"Okay. And the reason your character was killed off after you decided to quit the show was to make way for a spin off.....after they do a TV movie of it."</p>
		<p>"He actually told Mark that?" Lacy quizzed. "David and Griffen have always been tight."</p>
		<p>"Griffen was only too glad to let his old college buddy in on this because, apparently, after David and Griffen made that deal to produce the spin off starring Hayston, David got greedy pitching it around to another studio, figuring he could get more money and have greater control over it. Needless to say...."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Griffen was pissed." Lacy finished. </p>
		<p>"Exactly. There's something else that has to do with David's partner...."</p>
		<p>"Ryan White." Lacy supplied, crossing her legs.</p>
		<p>"Some deal they had to make a movie together and David tried to circumvent their plans. Instead of making the movie for Griffen Studios...."</p>
		<p>"That must be my movie with Koda Kannon." Lacy interjected. </p>
		<p>"Well, David planned to sweeten the deal with this other studio in hopes of them carrying the spin off of your show starring..."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"I know Hayston Rawlings. A pregnant, by my husband, Hayston Rawlings." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<i>
			<p>Oh, I think I see her fangs now.</p>
		</i>
		<p>Reading the expression on Gage's face, Lacy corrected her. "I'm not upset that he got her pregnant, or that they're together, not in the least. Here he tried to browbeat me bringing up our relationship in order to get his way and he has a few dirty little details lurking around him of his own." Lacy said as she let her fuming ramblings spill out unchecked.</p>
		<p>Astonished, Gage forced the next words out. "You think what we have is... dirty?" </p>
		<p>Stunned by the insensitivity of her words, Lacy rushed to Gage, kneeling at her feet. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. It's not the way I feel at all." Sorrowful blue eyes gazed into hurt green ones. "I didn't mean to compare his relationship to ours. I don't know what I was thinking." Lacy's pleading blue eyes begged Gage for absolution. "It was insensitive, but, what I said was not... unforgivable?" </p>
		<p>In that moment, Lacy proffered an opportunity for Gage to rise above her own hurt feelings.
			<i>I would forgive you anything.</i> Stunned by this prevailing and very true thought that resonated deep in her soul, Gage vocalized her resolve. "I would forgive you anything."
		</p>
		<p>Lacy leaned forward capturing exonerating lips sending all the love she felt for this woman who so easily traipsed past her tactless remarks offering nothing but love.</p>
