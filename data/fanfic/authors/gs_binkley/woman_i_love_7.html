<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Seven -->

<p>Gage clumsily helped Lacy prepare her children for bed. Having no experience with raising children, she was in awe of Lacy's infinite patience with her energetic off springs as they cheerfully splashed through their bath and scampered around the room while both Lacy and Gage tried to corral the racing children into their nightclothes.</p>
		<p>Even two of the smallest tee shirts Gage had tented the young boy and his sister. Although, Dani's borrowed nightwear fit more like an baggy shirt, Derek simply got lost in his loaned tee shirt. But it didn't faze either child, happy to be fed and clean. Lacy slipped into an extra pair of jogging clothes Gage had brought along.</p>
		<p>Settling her charges in the spare bedroom, Gage said her goodnights at the door. "If you need anything, I'm right down the hall. Although, I wished you would have taken the master bedroom."</p>
		<p>"Nonsense, Gage. We're perfectly fine here. Derek can sleep with me and the other twin bed will be fine for Dani."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure? It has a huge bed and you could all sleep together." Gage felt bad about the arrangement. The master bedroom offered not only more space, but also a private bathroom and she thought the family would feel safer sleeping together especially after the break in at their cabin. Suddenly, a loud clap of roaring thunder filled the air, startling everyone.
			<i>And then there's the storm outside. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy summoned her courage, reaffirming. "Really we're good here."</p>
		<p>Reluctantly, Gage waved goodbye. "Okay, I'll check the doors and windows before I go to bed. Goodnight."</p>
		<p>With Dani tucked in her bed, Lacy pulled the covers up, burying herself and her son. She listened to Gage's soft footsteps travel throughout the cabin until silence filled the room.
			<i>She must be in bed now. I don't know what we would have done without her tonight.
			</i>Another deafening slap of thunder on the heels of a lightning bolt shrouded the room in light. Dani stirred, Derek pushed closer and Lacy wished Gage was there with them.
			<i>My God, what am I thinking? She's right down hall. Yet, I want her here... with us. I feel so, I don't know, protected with her near.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Gage yanked the covers, snugly fitting them around her. The storm outside beat against the cabin relentlessly.
			<i>I better check the boathouse first thing in the morning. </i>Suddenly, remembering.
			<i>No, that will have to wait. That young deputy will be here for Lacy bright and early. She can't handle the kids and search for missing belongings. So, I'll have to go with her. </i>That settled, Gage smiled, turned on her side facing the opened doorway. After a few moments, Gage slipped into a light sleep.

		<p>The piercing boom of thunder broke Gage from her light dozing. Dragging her sleepy eyes open, a flash of lightning silhouetted a small figure dwarfed by a taller one holding something in its grasp framed within the doorway. Rubbing her eyes, Gage alertly sat up.</p>
		<p>"Gage?" A soft velvety voice called.</p>
		<p>"Lacy. What is it?" Gage pushed back the covers, edging near the side of the bed.</p>
		<p>"Can we sleep with you?" Lacy was relieved by her daughter's request.</p>
		<p>Hopping back, Gage allowed plenty of room in the king size bed for her welcomed and, apparently, eager guests as Dani lunged forward. "Of course, get in here."</p>
		<p>Dani crawled in the middle of the bed, planting herself. Lacy eased Derek down who then immediately climbed on top of Gage. After Lacy laid down, she reached for her son. "Derek, honey, come sleep over here with me." He refused to budge, wanting to be in the middle. "Dani, you sleep on the other side of me, okay?"</p>
		<p>She frowned. "I want to sleep next to Gage." Having secured a new first mate, Dani wanted to keep close ties to the owner of the boat to which she had become the self-appointed captain.</p>
		<p>"Come on, Dani. I want Derek in the middle." Her mother commanded.</p>
		<p>"Then I'll sleep on the other side of Gage." Before another word was spoken, she vaulted over the writer. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Derek settled in between his mother and Gage while Dani made herself comfortable. Worried a bit by their uninvited intrusion and her daughter's stubbornness, Lacy questioned Gage. "Is this okay? I mean..."</p>
		<p>Feeling a bit awkward with both kids on either side of her, yet at the same time Gage savored the hominess she felt with them near. "Yeah, I think I'll live." Cemented firmly between the two human walls. "Won't be able to turn, but I'll manage."</p>
		<p>For some reason, even as the storm outside continued in its fitful rage, the kids seemed oblivious to it. Dani started spieling out question upon question to Gage about when could they ride in the boat again and if tomorrow would be a good day to explore the cave while Derek giggled at his sister's non-stop queries.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy turned toward Gage, trying to settle her wiggling son between them. The ambient light from the stormy sky fell softly on the trusting features of the writer. "Sorry. She's rather inquisitive. And he..." Tickling her son. "...won't stay still."</p>
		<p>"It's okay." Gage had an idea. "Hey. If you two settle down and go to sleep, tomorrow night I'll tell you a story of the Shanglon Master and the woman he loved. What'd ya say?"</p>
		<p>"You tell stories?" Dani sat up.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. Mostly I just write them though."</p>
		<p>Derek clapped his hands. "Stories...yea."</p>
		<p>"What kind of stories?" Lacy inquired.</p>
		<p>"Good ones, I'd like to think." She smiled at Lacy who in turned did the same. "It's been a long day, so tonight we sleep and tomorrow... a story."</p>
		<p>"First, tell me about the story." Excited, Dani couldn't contain herself.</p>
		<p>"Dani. Sleep." Her mother's voice brooked no argument.</p>
		<p>"Jeez. I just wanted to know about the Shanglon Master." She pouted, but did as she was requested.</p>
		<p>For a few moments silence reigned until Dani turned on her side, propping her head up with her arm. "Gage, how did you get your name anyway?"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A dark memory came barreling to the forefront of her mind. "My mother."</p>
		<p>Seriously, Dani asked. "Didn't she like you?"</p>
		<p>A hearty laugh escaped Gage as Lacy scolded her daughter. "Dani, that's not nice."</p>
		<p>"Sorry." Dani scooted back down, tucking the covers around her. Mumbling, she couldn't help, but add. "Jeez, it is a weird name, you know."</p>
