<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Nine -->

<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent around the cabin with each occupant quietly lost in his or her own thoughts. Derek was the only one oblivious to any of the unsettling events of late.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It was with great reluctance that they readied for bed except for Dani who jumped at the first mention of bedtime. She rushed off to the bathroom to change without the usual prompting by her mother. Derek hung sleepily to his mother after she readied him for bed. Not having seen her daughter return from the bathroom, Lacy went in search for her.</p>
		<p>After checking the windows and doors, Gage ambled down the hallway practically running into Lacy, having just rushed out of the bathroom, still holding Derek. "Have you seen Dani? She's not in here."</p>
		<p>Panic rose as Gage raced through the cabin finding no trace of the missing child. Lacy tried to remain calm. Gage rejoined Lacy back in the hallway. "I couldn't find her anywhere. The only place I haven't looked..." Sharply turning around, Gage swept through the master bedroom doorway with Lacy right behind only to find Dani planted in the center of the bed.</p>
		<p>"What took you so long?" Dani asked innocently.</p>
		<p>"What are you doing in here?" The frightened mother asked sharper than she intended.</p>
		<p>"Gage is going to tell us the story of the Shanglon Master and the woman he loved." She stared inquisitively at them. "Right?"</p>
		<p>"Right." Gage looked at Lacy. "I did promise."</p>
		<p>Derek quickly fell from his sleepy haze at the mention of a story. "Story, yea!" He bounced in his mother's arms directing her to the bed.</p>
		<p>Lacy caved. "Which side do you sleep on?" She asked, moving toward the huge bed.</p>
		<p>Noticing for the first time the pristine white v-neck tee shirt Lacy was wearing, barely covering the top of her thighs, Gage was like a deer caught in a car's headlights.
			<i>Whichever side you do.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			"Gage?" Lacy waited patiently for a reply.
		</p>

		<p>Buried under the covers, Gage continued. "It was a day of great celebration in the land of Shang. The Shanglon Master, Geoffrey Saint Brandon, had led his kingdom in peace for many years now. Once a hard and demanding emperor the Shanglon Master had been tamed by the love of a beautiful dark haired maiden named Mecca. Today, Geoff was to announce the celebration of their impending marriage. </p>
		<p>"His personal free-thinking computer, Quint, had allowed Geoff to sleep longer than he wanted causing him to be late as he wanted extra time to prepare for this special day. When Geoff asked why Quint had let him over sleep, Quint simply replied that the Shanglon Master needed the extra sleep. Geoff was aggravated that his computer tried to run his life so he demanded that Quint transfer him to, Edifice, the main building."</p>
		<p>"That can't happen." Dani corrected Gage.</p>
		<p>"Well, yes, it can in this story. You see, this story takes place many years from now and technology is very advanced." Gage offered, then continued, as Derek listened intently with his two little hands propping up his chin. "Anyway the people of the land loved Mecca just as much as the Master for she alone had brought light to his dark heart. Mecca touched his soul with unconditional love. It was this love that swayed his dangerous nature to see beyond his own dreams of conquering the world for his own pleasure, bending it to his will. With that love she changed his life and the lives of his people. Of course, Quint was the first to see the depth of the love Mecca had for his Master. He was a bit of a matchmaker which thoroughly annoyed Geoff and the fact that Quint liked to buzz around through the air like a busy bee." Gage made a buzzing noise. "But in the end, Geoff could not deny the feelings he had for the woman he loved."</p>
		<p>"Jage, I like Tent." Derek interrupted the story.</p>
		<p>"Tent?" Gage asked. Derek giggled.</p>
		<p>"He means Quint. Derek has trouble saying some words." Lacy explained. Her son's speech difficulty was a main source of the problems between father and son. It was also the reason Derek didn't talk much.</p>
		<p>"Anyway, everything was going according to plan that day. The celebration was just about to begin when........" Gage paused for dramatic effect. "Enter the evil Robida." (Row-bee-dah)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>On edge, Dani waited with baited breath. "Well, what happened next?"</p>
		<p>Looking at a sleepy eyed Derek, Gage said. "To be continued."</p>
		<p>Shoulders slumped temporarily until an idea ran through her head.
			<i>That means we get to sleep in here again.
			</i>"Cool." Dani plopped down next to her mother and fell asleep.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Surprised at her daughter's quick surrender, Lacy gathered Derek closer to her. "That's a first. But I'm not complaining."
			<i>I guess we really should go back to our bedroom. </i>Lacy turned to Gage, studying her features.
			<i>She's not complaining.
			</i> Giving in to her desires, Lacy decided to stay put. "Gage, thanks for everything."
		</p>
		<p>A smile swept across her face as Gage thought,
			<i>My pleasure.</i>
		</p>
		<p>As they did the night before, when sleep found a home in both, they gravitated to each other, comforted in the closeness.</p>
