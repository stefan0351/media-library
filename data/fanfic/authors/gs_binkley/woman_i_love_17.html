<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Seventeen -->

<p>As Dani guided the boat to dock under Gage's supervision, they saw the fair's skyline against a cloudless sky. Derek tried to leap from his mother's arm to get closer to the festive sound of carnival music playing that inevitability drew children like a magnet. Boat anchored securely to the dock, the foursome walked the short distance to the fairgrounds. </p>
		<p>Derek could hardly contain himself, scrambling out of his mother's arms onto the ground, making a beeline to the yellow rubber ducks floating in a small pond. "Ducky." He leaned over the short tank, grabbing at one of the ducks, on the verge of falling in until his mother rescued him from a certain watery fate. Pulling him back up in her arms, Derek ripped a huge smile across his face with his prize in hand. </p>
		<p>The carnie cast a sharp eye at the young child and was about to protest when Gage stepped up between them. Knowing full well Derek would not part with his new friend. "Listen, sir. How bout I give you....." She jammed her hand in her pocket retrieving some money. "A twenty... for the duck."</p>
		<p>"No can do." He scratched his week old beard. "But you can play." </p>
		<p>So Gage, along with Dani and Lacy, selected numerous ducks, flipping them over to see what they didn't win. Derek was oblivious to the outcome; he was already a happy little camper.</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Lacy whispered to Gage.</p>
		<p>A confused look washed over the writer's face. "David would have made him put the duck back." A pause. "He's a bit frugal with his money."</p>
		<p>This made Gage smile, thinking.
			<i>Twenty dollars was a drop in the bucket...pond, </i>she amended.
			<i>Compared to that smile the kid now wore.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Dani decided to take charge of her crew and led them directly to the Ferris wheel. She wanted to ride high on the round machine so she could see where everything was located. "First stop, Ferris wheel."</p>
		<p>Dani rode with her mother while Gage escorted the three year old. He scooted closer as the chair rose higher and higher in the air. Dani waved frantically to Derek from the chair above them before her mother settled her daughter back down. </p>
		<p>As if on cue, Dani's got her wish when her chair stopped at the very peak of the wheel. "There's the scrambler." She squealed. "And we have to go ride that round thing over there."</p>
		<p>Following her daughter's arm aim, Lacy noted. "I think that's the ring of fire."</p>
		<p>"Cool." Then her attention diverted to a building like structure across from the ring of fire. "Is that a fun house?" Dani leaned over the chair's rail causing it to tip forward. "Derek, you want to go to the fun house?" She yelled below.</p>
		<p>Lacy tried to equalize the rocking motion her daughter started, pulling her back. "Dani, you can ask him when we get down from this." Lacy didn't really mind heights exactly though she was dubious of it. There was a near accident on the set of her show when her harness slipped, plummeting her to the ground only to stop a few feet from the hard concrete floor. She sucked in a deep breath, willing the chair to still and it did. But only for a brief moment before the carnie started the wheel on it's circular journey.</p>
		<p>Finally on the ground, Lacy suggested they have some lunch before taking any more rides. The high carb and all too sweet lunch served up did nothing to settle her stomach. So they decided to visit some of the farm animals to Derek's delight and Dani's consternation. She was the kinda girl that liked action.</p>
		<p>Gage was all too happy to go along with whatever they wanted, savoring the time spent with what she had come to think of as her new family. She knew it was wishful thinking, but then again sometimes dreams do come true.</p>
		<p>At last, Dani was leading her gang toward the fun house when Derek spied a big yellow giraffe that you would think the kid couldn't live without the way he was carrying on.
			<i>I'll never get to the fun house at this rate. And we can't go on rides hauling that big thing around. </i> "Can't we do that later?"
		</p>
		<p>Her mother shot her a look that offered the young girl no alternative. Dropped shoulders gave away her resolve. "Then let's get on with it."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Lacy said sharply, letting her daughter know that indignant tone was not acceptable. "This is a family outing. We all get to do something we want."</p>
		<p>Lacy's words regarding family did not go unnoticed by Gage. The smile on her face shown brightly and even someone in a space shuttle overhead would have easily seen it. So ecstatic by her companion's words, Gage picked up the rifle on the table in front of her positive she would win the big yellow giraffe for Derek.
			<i>Apparently, Derek's favorite color is yellow. </i> This was another fact she would stow away for later.
		</p>
		<p>Slapping some money on the table, Gage took careful aim. Twenty dollars later, she still hadn't got pass winning a couple of small gray elephants. Looking the rifle over, she demanded. "Got another one? This one's sights are off." Shaking his head, the carnie offered her a third rifle.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>With the last shot being fired and missed, Lacy took pity on her. "Here." Lacy traded her son for the rifle. Two dollars and three perfect shots later, Derek had his giraffe.</p>
		<p>Lacy shrugged, looking directly at Gage. "I learned to shoot on the show."</p>
		<p>With Derek in her arms and the giraffe wrapped in his arms, Gage strolled off. "Yeah, well, some people are just lucky. What'd ya say we hit that fun house."
			<i>I should be able to do that without embarrassing myself.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy rolled her eyes, holding a smirk firmly on her face.
			<i>I think I bruised someone's ego.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"It's about time." Dani skipped off.</p>
		<p>As they waited in line, Dani felt someone staring. She twisted her head around from side to side, intently taking in the crowd. </p>
		<p>"What is it?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Her eyes fell on the young man moving behind her mother. "It's him."</p>
		<p>Ned, followed closely by his friend, Buddy, bumped into the star. </p>
		<p>"Excuse me." Lacy turned, paling when her concerned blue eyes rested on the two teens. </p>
		<p>Startled, both Ned and Buddy froze in place until a heated liberating voice thawed their bodies. "Ned, get up here!" Ned and his friend jumped ahead, joining his mother in the line near the steps of the fun house.</p>
		<p>"That's Mrs. Raye and her son." Dani informed Gage.</p>
		<p>"I know. And that's Ned's friend." Nodding her head in landlord's direction, Gage asked. "Who's that guy with them?"</p>
		<p>Dani shrugged as Lacy answered. "The handyman, Ralph. Remember, I told you about him when I went back to the cabin that next day."</p>
		<p>He finally turned around facing them. Ralph's mean brown eyes surveyed the couple then landed squarely on Dani. Her mother pulled her closer out of his view waiting until he turned back around.</p>
		<p>Having now recognized Sally Raye's handyman, Gage asked. "Do you want to do this later?" Concern written all over her face.</p>
		<p>Dropping her eyes to her daughter, Lacy nodded. "No. We're fine."</p>
		<p>Dani jumped in the two-seated cart. She shared the front seat with her mother and as usual Gage and Derek partnered up again in the backseat, with giraffe tagging along. </p>
		<p>The fun house turned out to be a haunted house, starting out with a ride through a long, dark and scary tunnel filled with objects meant to be menacing to its guests. At the end, they had to take a short walk out of a semi-lit corridor that led to the exit.</p>
		<p>Dani loved it, making bloodcurdling sounds of her own while Derek climbed on Gage's lap. When the ride was over, Dani jumped from the cart while Lacy helped her son out and Gage wrestled with the giraffe. Dani ran ahead down the dark corridor unmindful of any danger that might lie in its wake. </p>
		<p>When Lacy heard the scream sail down the corridor, she scrambled ahead leaving Gage to take care of her son. Lacy approached an older man from behind, jerking him around as he was about to lean forward to where her frighten daughter stood. "What the hell are you doing?" She demanded, recognizing the handyman instantly. </p>
		<p>Gage caught up with her, taking a place next to Dani, pulling her out of the line of fire from the anticipated altercation. "Come here." </p>
		<p>"What's it to ya?" The irascible handyman spat back, letting go of the whistle wrapped around the young girl's neck. "Damn girl, just started screaming."</p>
		<p>The protective mother clenched her fist, cocked and ready to fire even though it hung at her side. Through clenched teeth, she summoned all of her tolerance. "I suggest you get out of here...NOW!" The command left no room for doubt.</p>
		<p>Ralph backed up a few steps. "You people are all alike. You think you're better than everyone else. Well, I got news for......" </p>
		<p>Stepping forward, Lacy loomed over the short man, cutting off any more of his spiteful retort. Ralph reasoned retreat was the better part of valor even though he didn't know what it meant. </p>
		<p>Scampering off quickly, hoping to catch up with Sally and let her know he'd stood up for her. Ralph, who had cared for Sally for years, appointed himself her protector, which automatically made him Ned's protector, too. She'd let him hang around knowing full well he was in love with her even though Sally was just using him. It was nice having your very own puppy dog and she got him to do her bidding no matter how nasty. </p>
		<p>Ralph listened well when his love ranted that if it weren't for that high kaflutten movie star seducing her innocent son into returning to the cabin, Ned wouldn't be in trouble with the law. They both ignored the fact that nothing came of the break in since no one filed any charges. </p>
		<p>Lacy rushed to her daughter. "Are you all right?" Running her hands over Dani's face and arms, looking for any sign of harm, Lacy heaved a sigh in relief. </p>
		<p>"He just scared me... a bit." Dani assured her.</p>
		<p>Fussing the young girl's dark hair, Gage subtly altered Dani's perception of her admission. "You did good, yelling like that. I think though that you scared him." Gage presented a knowing wink.</p>
		<p>Perking up considerably. "I did, didn't I?" Her mother confirmed her own approval, giving her daughter a wink too. "What next?"</p>
		<p>"Ducks." Derek piped up.</p>
		<p>Rolling her blue eyes in surrender, Dani remembered her mother's words about the family outing. "Ducks it is then." A short pause. "Again."</p>
		<p>Derek splashed the water in the duck pond much to the vendor's dismay, but he was helplessly to do anything when Lacy flashed him an endearing smile when she asked permission that he swore actually curled his toes. Of course, he would never admit that out loud.
			<i>What would the rest of the carnies think? </i>
		</p>
		<p>A few rides later that included the scrambler, the ring of fire and the flying fisherman's boat, the newly formed family was ready to call it a day. Even Dani admitted to being all tuckered out. Derek rested his sleepy head on his mother's shoulder, arms wrapped securely around the little rubber duck while Dani latched onto Gage's right hand since the other one was dutifully carrying the giraffe.</p>
		<p>After the short walk to the boat in the dark, they carefully negotiated the dock lit only by a few lanterns. Gage settled Dani down on the back seat. </p>
		<p>"I'm tired." She declared, laid down and closed her eyes, but not before claiming the giraffe as he bed partner. </p>
		<p>Lacy stepped over the gunwale onto the boat. She laid her son on the other bench, pulling out a couple of extra shirts from her bag then covered both her children. </p>
		<p>Gage fired up the engine then started to get out of the boat, but was stopped when Lacy grabbed her shoulder. "Here. Let me." She jumped out of the boat, unleashed the ropes attached to the dock, flipping them back in the boat. As she raised her foot, it slipped on the side of the boat. Unbalanced, Lacy fell forward into the surprised and delighted arms of the writer, knocking them back onto the captain's seat.</p>
		<p>When hopeful blue met welcoming green illuminated by the lanterns, both knew the pivotal moment had arrived. They felt the crackling current of energy running between them, pounding on the door as loudly as Lacy's heart thundered against her chest. She begged admission into the entryway of Gage's heart. Zeroing in on the luscious targeted lips before her, any doubt in the star's mind crusaded past emotional and social barriers long standing, crumbling like the wall of Jericho.</p>
		<p>For Gage, a riot of sensations cannoned through her fully alert tingling body. The gaze in Lacy's penetrating blue eyes threatened to steal Gage's breath away. What she had long desired, poised a finger's width away, and on the verge of receiving as breaths mingled in delicious anticipation of fireworks primed to ignite at the sweet touch of their lips was at hand. </p>
		<p>The tenderness of the kiss was staggering. Warm lips brushed against inviting ones in a dance so intoxicating they would both swear later they heard a harp play and blue birds soared high into the sky creating a vortex in which the two would be lovers lost themselves. Savoring the sensual kiss of the writer's lips, Lacy's mouth lounged there for what she hoped would be eternity, soaking in the depth of love she felt course through her body, filling it to the brim. </p>
		<p>Suddenly, sensing they were being watched, Gage began the unbelievable task of bringing their first kiss to a close. While in retreat, Gage stole kiss after kiss, each shorter than the one before, but not in its intensity. </p>
		<p>Swallowing hard, Lacy gasped. "That was nice." Allowing her head to rest against Gage's flushed face.</p>
		<p>The deep breath she took shuttered through her body. "Nice?"</p>
		<p>"Mmmmmm." Lacy moaned. "Very nice."</p>
		<p>Shifting her head around covertly, searching for an intruder. "Well, that's a step up, I guess."</p>
		<p>Lacy repositioned her forehead; laying it against Gage, nose touching nose. "I've never been kissed like that before."</p>
		<p>"Baby, I need some clarification here...good or bad... and I need it now." Gage insisted, waiting on baited breath for the verdict. </p>
		<p>"Very good." Ducking her head back down to capture the writer's lips again. "Very, very good." She stole another kiss, although Gage would gladly give them away free of charge. "As a matter of fact..." Lacy dropped her voice to its lowest register. "That's the best kiss I've ever received."</p>
		<p>Just before Gage reclaimed the star's inviting lips, she smiled. "Now you're talking."</p>
		<p>The shadow lurking near the boat dock slipped away having seen enough.
			<i>Now I have you right where I want you. </i>
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>It was a long ride home in the cool, dark night as Gage guided the boat back to their cabin. The kids never woke on the trip, easily putting them to bed.</p>
		<p>It was inevitable that they would share a bed tonight and every other night if they had their way. Silently, as they readied for bed both lulled in deep thought. Unbeknownst to the other, sharing the same feelings about the kiss, the night, tomorrow and their future. Two roads had finally merged into one, forever linked. </p>
		<p>Slipping into bed, Lacy crawled into the writer's waiting arms. Snuggling ever closer, Gage's wandering hands had a mind all their own. They cuddled and kissed, lazing against each other allowing soft moans of pleasure to escape. Grabbing at Lacy's white v-neck tee shirt, Gage suggested seductively. "Let's take your clothes off so they don't get in the way."</p>
		<p>With Gage's persistent hands roaming her body unchecked, Lacy replied seriously. "I don't think my clothes are hindering your hands any." A smile appeared briefly before she claimed the writer's lips on the verge of objecting. </p>
		<p>Protest stymied before it had a chance to be verbalized, Gage savored the defeat, becoming a willing participant in her own remonstration's demise. "I could do this forever."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Yes, forever. </i> That idea brought a chilling effect. Lacy pulled away slightly, breathless from the last kiss. "Gage, sweetheart....." The insistent lips that attacked the star's neck distracted her momentarily. "Ahh...sweetheart, please." Unrelenting hands glided over the curve of her full, firm breast, pausing just the briefest of moments, Lacy moaned.
			<i>Oh, God, that was nice.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>"What?" Gage asked weakly, leaving a trail of soft kisses down Lacy's neck to her collarbone.</p>
		<p>"Sweetheart."
			<i>You are driving me to distraction, </i>Lacy thought, powered by the traveling hands of the writer. "We need to talk." It took all her effort, but she finally got it out.
		</p>
		<p>"Okay." Gage said, but never stopped her sensual assault on the willing respondent. </p>
		<p>Lacy reasoned she had to do something and fast before things went too far. A plan formulated quickly.
			<i>I've got one shot at this in order to get her full attention. </i> Corralling every feeling she held for the writer presently making mad, passionate love to her, Lacy commanded the lips before her, claiming them fully and conquered Gage, kissing her to exhaustion, sapping every last bit of passion that had just exploded forth from the writer.
		</p>
		<p>Breathless and satiated, Gage fell back on the pillow, eyes closed, head spinning out of control. "Wow." Escaped in a sated sigh. </p>
		<p>"Can we talk now?" Lacy's own words weakly spilled forth, dizzied from the kiss herself. </p>
		<p>Gage's only reply, a wicked smile as dazed eyes slit open, gazing at the woman she loved. </p>
		<p>"I'll take that as a yes." In spite of the look Gage sent her. A long moment passed as Lacy constructed her next words. "I think we should... maybe for now..."</p>
		<p>"Take it slow." Gage supplied, propping herself up on her elbow, she pulled Lacy into a smothering embrace. Whispering in her ear, Gage said the words Lacy struggled to enunciate. "It's the kids." Her lips quickly nuzzled the enticing ear next to her mouth, nipping it, then Gage reluctantly moved back to look into concerned blue eyes.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Lacy admitted. "And it's me, too. This is all so soon after...." Her mind traveled the short distance over the last few days reclaiming the memory of David's arrival, his declaration of love for Hayston Rawlings, her former co-star, and the divorce papers she'd so recently signed.</p>
		<p>"Take all the time you want." Gage assured her. "I'll wait for as along as it takes." The quick kiss punctuated the promise. </p>
		<p>"Thank you." Lacy laid her head on Gage's shoulder, draped her arm and long leg over the writer, closed her eyes and quietly whispered. "Goodnight."</p>
