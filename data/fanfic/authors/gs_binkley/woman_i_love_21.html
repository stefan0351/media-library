<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Twenty-One -->

<p>Lacy chased Gage into the bedroom, throwing both her arms around Gage's neck as their lips met passionately. The force of the embrace sent them onto the bed, wrapped in each other's arms. </p>
		<p>"I've got you now." Lacy husked.</p>
		<p>Gage smiled.
			<i>You had me the first moment I saw you.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Smothering each other with kisses, lips moved in harmony savoring the sweet taste being offered. Melting in the intensity of their kisses fueled the jolts of pleasure that shot through Lacy's body, now on fire. With a light feathery brush of the star's lips, the writer's demanding tongue asked and received entrance to explore at will.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy tugged at Gage's unwelcome shirt, invading fingers deftly manipulating the buttons, opening the offending shirt for her own exploration. The star's hands caressed the supple skin below it memorizing this new territory in which she was staking claim. The writer's breast ached in pleasure allowing a deep sigh to escape her lips as Lacy's fingers slid over the firm yet soft mound.</p>
		<p>Temporarily unnerved by Lacy's roaming hands, Gage continued her own assault on the willing women above her letting her hungry lips migrate down Lacy's sexy neck, leaving a trail of soft, tantalizing and, oh, so provocative kisses. </p>
		<p>Yanking the star's top then pulling it over her head, Gage's eyes immediately zeroed in on the beautiful breast dangling above her. As Gage took possession of a mouthful of the delicious nipple before her, the star moaned at the contact, distracting her own journey further. Suckling the breast caused Lacy to push forward while pulling the writer even closer. Gage's lips took advantage of this contact twirling her tongue around the firm nipple, sucking, kissing..... worshiping it.</p>
		<p>Running her hands through the writer's short blonde hair, Lacy gasped when Gage nipped ever so lightly planting slow, teasing kisses as she moved to give the other neglected breast the same attention. The pleasing tongue snaked out and playfully flicked the corral colored nipple. Her tongue continued to trace a lazy path over Lacy's beautiful breast, reveling in the riot of sensations permeating both lovers.</p>
		<p>The writer flipped the star over catching Lacy's piercing blue eyes for a brief moment. With a sultry, predatory smile, Gage nibbled her way over the star's soft, flat stomach pausing to languidly circle Lacy's navel with her tongue. </p>
		<p>The writer's eager hands traveled along the curve of the star's hips down her leg, pushing her jeans down as her fingers grazed over the supple skin. Lacy felt a liquid rush of fire between her legs as Gage's fingertips danced up her inner thigh. Having rid the stunning woman of her clothes, the writer engaged in a full frontal attack. The blonde glided up the star's tingling body, returning her hungry lips to take possession of Lacy's mouth. </p>
		<p>Breathlessly, Lacy pulled back to catch her breath. "I love you." </p>
		<p>As Lacy reached up to claim the mouth she relished kissing, Gage stopped her, meeting a disappointed frown. "Lacy, you remember when you asked me what you were wearing the day I first met you?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." Lacy reached again to take possession of those enticing lips a mere breath away. Frustrating the star one more time, Gage continued. "There's something I didn't tell you."</p>
		<p>This statement got Lacy's full attention. "What?" Almost afraid to ask. </p>
		<p>"I remember having this notion crash over me, filling the depth of my soul." Sincere green eyes pinned blue.</p>
		<p>Lacy arched a perfect sculptured eyebrow in question.</p>
		<p>Simply stated, Gage revealed. "There stands before me the woman I love." Between soft, tantalizing kisses, Gage declared in a whisper over and over again. "I love you, Lacy, so very much."</p>
		<p>Losing herself in the love and passion she felt, captivating every sensation, Gage luxuriated in the feelings that ran rampant through her being. Capturing the inviting lips of the dark haired woman again, roaming hands had their way bringing Lacy on the verge of unimaginable heights. </p>
		<p>"I'm gonna love you till you scream out my name in passion." Gage declared, capturing her lover's lips again, tongues dueling in a heated exchange.</p>
		<p>Breaking from an intense kiss, heaving, Lacy countered. "And you're so sure I'll do that, huh?" </p>
		<p>With a wicked grin, Gage's tone held a promise. "Well, you will if I do it right." With that coaxing hands slithered across Lacy's body while pleasing lips did their part driving the woman in her arms into a sensual vortex to a never before reached precipice, making good on that the pledge. </p>
		<p>The last conscious thought prevailing in the star's mind left no doubt that the promise offered had been delivered.
			<i>Oh, you did it right, sweetheart, so very right. </i>A satisfied smile framed the star's beautiful face all night long, wrapped tightly in the possessive arms of her lover.
		</p>

		<p>Morning found Lacy draped over the writer, happy and content. Lazing against the warm body next to her, Lacy climbed over Gage, settling her lower body between the writer's legs.</p>
		<p>Soft lips brushed against still sleeping ones. Gage smiled at the intoxicating contact. "Hmmmm. Do I get to wake up like this every morning?" Sleepy eyes opened, gazing at the gorgeous woman who took up residence on top of her.</p>
		<p>Serious blue eyes stared into suddenly concerned green. "You are going to marry me." It was more of a command than a question.</p>
		<p>Completely taken aback by the insistent request, Gage allowed only a millisecond to recover before responding. "Anytime, anywhere, anyway."</p>
		<p>"Good." Lacy sealed the vow with a kiss before either one had time to think about the near impossible quest. </p>
		<p>Both refused to allow uncertain invading thoughts such as:
			<i>She's not even divorced yet. Is there a place where two women can actually get married or will we just have a commitment ceremony? What will my parents think? How will her kids react? What about my career? What about her career?</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Lacy?" Gage gathered the woman on top of her closer; planting a soft kiss on her head allowing only one disrupting thought to intervene. "Are you sure?"</p>
		<p>The dark head popped up. "Sure about what? Us?"</p>
		<p>"No, not exactly. Me." Gage swallowed. "You deserve the very best."</p>
		<p>"I have the very best." Dipping her head, capturing Gage's lips in a passionate, reassuring kiss.</p>
		<p>When the soft wet lips she craved pulled back slightly, Gage vowed. "Whatever happens, I will always love you no matter what. And, I'll be there...through your divorce, custody of the kids. Everything. I promise."</p>
		<p>Laying her head on Gage's chest, Lacy closed her eyes and whispered. "I know."
			<i>And I know things won't be easy. </i>Lacy rose up staring into lover's eyes intently.
			<i>I will always love you, too, no matter what.....I promise. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Her blue eyes told Gage what she didn't say out loud. "I know." Gently laying Lacy's head back to her chest, Gage sucked in a deep breath knowing their lives had been irrevocably changed the moment they met that day on the beach. Destiny had rode up and carted them away, forever entangling their lives and the soul they shared. </p>
