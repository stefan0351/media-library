<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Three -->

<p>Sally Raye eased her old car down the secluded driveway to Cabin C all the while ignoring her passengers. After pulling to a stop, Sally's dark brown eyes glanced through the rearview mirror at the child in the back seat who had been suspiciously eyeing her during the fifteen-minute drive from town. </p>
		<p>
			Hurrying out of the car as fast as her old rickety body could carry her, Sally made her way to the front door, inserting the key. The landlord wanted to get her new tenants settled then head back in town as fast as she could so she wouldn't miss her regular Wednesday night Bingo game.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As Lacy extracted Derek from his car seat, Dani slipped out of the back seat, jumped up on the short porch then headed for the front cabin railing that overlooked Lake MyKee. </p>
		<p>Reluctant to help, Sally did pick up two of the lighter bags figuring it wouldn't strain her bad back too much.
			<i>If I don't help, that gray haired old witch, Gladys, will be sure to get my spot at Bingo. At least I got the good sense to dye my hair. </i>Sally smiled at that thought remembering how her handyman's brown eyes had lit up after her first experiment with the hair coloring.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy took the two steps up the porch carrying her son. "Dani, come take care of Derek while I get our bags."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Slowly, Dani tore herself away from the railing all the while keeping a close eye on Sally.
			<i>She's not like Grace at all. </i>
		</p>
		<p>With Derek under the watchful eye of his sister, Lacy started unloading their bags from the back of the station wagon. The slow process agitated the landlord so she retrieved another bag from her car.</p>
		<p>"My son, Ned, was disappointed he missed you. But he should be by in the next day or two to check on things and see if you want to rent a car of your own." She flopped the last bag down on the porch. "He can drive you to town if you do. That will just tickle him pink. He's a big fan of yours."</p>
		<p>Figuring she had supplied enough chitchat and happy to get away from the young girl's scrutiny, Sally hurried off without waiting for Lacy to reply.</p>
		<i>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
		</i>
		<p>Lacy Levine spared a moment to watch the landlord head down the road. "All right then, let's get the bags inside and then how ?bout a quick look around the place?" With those words, Dani jumped into action, picking up one of the heavy bags and tugging Derek inside behind her. Dropping the bag near the sofa, Dani lifted Derek onto it. "Now, stay right there. Okay?" </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A sense of loss flashed across Derek's face as his sister turned to leave him. Within two steps, the eight year old twisted back around meeting her brother's soft gray pouting eyes. "Jeez." She walked back to him. "I'll be right back. Then we get to go play. Okay?" With a quick hug from his sister, the young boy's expression bloomed brighter. </p>
		<p>Lacy observed her children's interaction happy in the knowledge that they adored each other. Keeping a close eye on Derek, Lacy sat the two bags of grocery's on the counter that she had purchased before leaving town then started to put them away.</p>
		<p>Dani took no time at all in bringing their bags from the porch and piling them next to the sofa. "Okay, mom, ready to go exploring." She helped Derek off the couch and headed for the front door. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Just a minute, Dani." Noticing the sliding door off the living room, she placed the last can of food on the shelf. "Let's go out the back." Opening the sliding door that led to the porch, her kids slipped through quickly. Dani handed Derek off to his mom then bounded down the longer flight of steps onto the grassy area between the cabin and the lake. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Derek refused his mother's inviting arms, insisting on taking the five steps down himself giving Dani plenty of time to greet the water's edge instantly in search of interesting and unusual rocks. The gold mine she found would add handsomely to her already growing collection. Immediately claiming several rocks for her own, both of her hands were full.</p>
		<p>As Lacy caught up to her older child, the brilliant smile blazing on the young girl's face sprung open to her normal personality instead of the quiet demeanor Dani had shown since their arrival in town. "You were awfully quiet on the way here. Anything wrong?" Hoping Dani hadn't been agonizing over her father's absence.</p>
		<p>"No." The look on her mother's face demanded more than the laconic answer she offered, so she added. "I just don't like her. She's not at all like Grace." She continued stockpiling rocks, pulling her shirt out to hold them all. "Wouldn't answer any of my questions." Mumbling to herself.</p>
		<p>Lacy watched Derek waddle along the uneven shoreline in the opposite direction, but directed her comment to Dani. "No, she's not though she seemed nice enough."</p>
		<p>Dani stood back up after retrieving a star shaped rock. "She dyes her hair, you know."</p>
		<p>Turning around to face her daughter, Lacy expressed concern at the remark. "And that makes her?"</p>
		<p>"Highly suspicious. Like she has something to hide." One look at the old woman and Dani had completed her investigation of their landlord. Her deductions about the older woman revealed Sally to be someone with a dark past, probably involved in some kind of criminal activity, definitely something hiding behind those mean eyes. Six years of watching her mother's cop show provided Dani with all the education she reasoned she needed to make her assessment.
			<i>And of course, I got a gut feeling about her and it ain't good. </i>
		</p>
		<p>While proud of her daughter's language skills and intellect at such a young age, Lacy did not like the fact that Dani was making value judgments about others by the way they looked. "I've dyed my hair before. Does that mean I have something to hide too?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." She said to the point.</p>
		<p>An arched eyebrow prompted her daughter to continue. "Yourself." Dani supplied, laughing out loud. "In your show when your character, Samantha, went undercover, remember?" Lacy joined her daughter in laughter as she recalled the red spiked hairstyle she adorned for that scene.
			<i>I should have worn a wig like Ryan suggested. It took days to get back to my natural hair coloring.</i>
		</p>
		<p>In the distance, Derek heard the chuckling sounds of his mother and sister waft through the air as he ploughed up a small embankment. Derek loved the out doors and could play for hours either by himself or with his mom or sister. It was in these alone times that an adventurous nature boldly peeked out from his shy personality. An outgoing personality he stole from, Devlin, the main character on his favorite cartoon show. Devlin was an audacious little guy with a curious and daring attitude cloaked with a bravado that inevitably led him to trouble. Therefore, it was a good thing that Devlin had his very own protector, Gentry. </p>
		<p>Cresting the small hill near the top, which gave way to a sharp drop facing the shoreline, Derek's eagle eyes caught sight of a moving object bouncing along. </p>
		<p>Gage Ballant strolled along the sparsely sandy beach scanning the ground below for rocks while idly thinking about her new screenplay. She became much more discriminate in the rocks she selected for her collection as she became older. The arrival of her fortieth birthday two years ago had sobered her impulsive actions somewhat. If it hadn't, she would have had to rent a warehouse for all the rocks she would have undoubtedly collected through the years.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Suddenly, her concentration from the many stones lying on the ground was jerked away by a soft shuffling noise a top the six-foot high embankment. </p>
		<p>Looking up, green eyes locked with gray that sparked a proverbial connection. Rooted in place, Gage pondered the familiar link between them, then a quick movement from the young child spurred Gage into action.</p>
		<p>From a distance, Lacy scanned the area in search of her wayward son. Tracking him as he moved toward the edge of the embankment, seeing him pick up speed, her heart thundered against her chest sensing the danger that awaited him at the edge of the short knoll. "Derek." She screamed.</p>
		<p>Lacy bolted toward her son, terror reigning in every part of her body as she watched him run then jump over the edge. Dani felt the impending danger her brother was embarking upon and immediately dropped all her rocks. </p>
		<p>With arms straight out to his side, Derek leaped into the wind off the small cliff as he yelled. "Fly plane, fly." The broad smile on his face left no doubt that the woman below would catch him. He sailed directly into her arms, knocking her down.</p>
		<p>Having no idea what awaited her son's takeoff, Lacy crested the hill winded and readied to jump too until her concerned eyes came to rest upon her son tucked safely in the arms of a stranger. Stopping quickly, Dani took a place along side her mother. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>After recognizing that Derek had landed safely, she asked. "Did you see that, mom? He was flying like a plane." The levity her statement offered helped to alleviate the raging horror that had tornadoed though both of them. </p>
		<p>Lacy scrambled down around the rise to collect her son. Dani contemplated jumping the distance to the shoreline below, but quickly reconsidered. Instead, she followed the same path as her mother.</p>
		<p>Lying on her back, Gage smiled into the laughing face of the undaunted boy sitting on top of her. Noticing the still concerned face of what could only be the boy's mother rushing forward, Gage pushed up to a sitting position. "I take it this obviously fearless boy belongs to you."</p>
		<p>Lacy swooped her son into her arms temporarily ignoring her son's savior. Hugging him desperately, the mother kissed Derek's face over and over again. Following her mother's instincts, her eyes and hands roamed all over his body ensuring that he was unhurt. </p>
		<p>Dani soon arrived, carefully assessing the blonde stranger with a sharp quirk of an eye as Gage brushed herself off then stood erect. The young girl wondered what the stranger had did or said to get her bashful brother to jump off the ledge when she had no luck with him in playing along with her flying game on the airplane. With arms crossed, Dani silently let the scene unfold before her as she put on her invisible detective hat.</p>
		<p>The young girl's evident attitude directed at Gage did not go unnoticed. But, Gage altered her attention to mother and son. "He's okay?" As Gage stepped closer, Derek leaned toward her, grabbing at the writer. Lacy, loath to let go, finally did at her son's insistence. He immediately wrapped his right arm around Gage's neck then kissed her on the cheek, creating a rare blush that filled the writer's face. She then shifted her young charge to her side. </p>
		<p>Stunned at Derek's display of affection for the total stranger, Lacy thanked her son's savior profusely then introduced herself. "My name's Lacy Levine and this is my daughter." Pointing to a still quiet child. "And, well, I guess my son has already uniquely introduced himself to you. His name's Derek, by the way."</p>
		<p>Extending her hand, Gage peered into the amazing blue eyes of the boy's mother. "Gage Ballant." Quickly taking in the other woman's physique before nodding over her shoulder, Gage offered. "I'm staying at the cabin over there." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The warm hand that clasped around Lacy's hand sent an unexpected shiver through her. She returned the intense gaze of the writer establishing a bond between them that traveled beyond the physical. Surprised, they both felt a yearning calling them home. Undeniably, both knew the familiar link would linger long into the night. While this emotional exchanged confused Lacy, it brought clarity to the writer. </p>
		<p>Retrieving her hand, the writer shifted uncomfortably as Derek played with the mariner linked gold necklace around her neck. Gage sensed Lacy's need to hold her son again. "Here, back to your mom." With those encouraging words, Derek happily vaulted into his mother's waiting arms as a quick kiss and a hug awaited him.</p>
		<p>"Thank you again." Lacy smiled at Gage shyly. "We just arrived and was taking a look around before we unpacked." Feeling the need to explain why she lost sight of her son, Lacy continued. "Dani was collecting rocks on the shore and reminded me of something funny....big red hair." Gage's offered a raised eyebrow in question. "Anyway, that's no excuse to lose track of my son."</p>
		<p>"Hey, don't worry about it." The pain of guilt was evident on the actresses face. And Gage wanted to see her beautiful smile again. "I totally understand."</p>
		<p>"You have kids?" Lacy asked.</p>
		<p>"No." </p>
		<p>"Brothers and sisters?"</p>
		<p>"No." Hesitant, she continued. "Let me retract my earlier statement. I guess I don't understand. Never been around kids much actually." Dark thoughts loomed through the writer's head.</p>
		<p>Feeling she struck a nerve, Lacy changed the subject. "I guess we're going to be neighbors. Have you been here long?"</p>
		<p>"Bout five weeks." Gage's voice stumbled as she offered. "I... I could... ah, show you around once you get settled, I mean." Looking up slightly at Lacy, Gage recaptured the piercing blue she knew she would never stop wanting to gaze into. </p>
		<p>The bright smile that sprang on her mother's face was countered by an expression of annoyance dawning upon Dani's features. "We can explore on our own. Thank you very much."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Lacy cast her petulant daughter a dour look. "We would love it, wouldn't we, Dani?"</p>
		<p>Unenthusiastically, Dani agreed. "Yeah, I guess. Do you have anything interesting around here?" Keeping her tone in check. She didn't want another stern warning from her mother, but was unwilling to accept this total stranger into the fold so easily as her mother and brother apparently did. </p>
		<p>Gage thought frantically trying to remember what interested her as a child. "I've got a boat.... and there's a cave about a quarter of a mile past my cabin." The bright smile that popped up on the young girl's face clued Gage that she was on the right track. "If that interests you at all."</p>
		<p>Becoming aware of the uninvited spontaneous smile she now displayed in front of this stranger at the mention of the boat and cave, Dani reigned in her unchecked emotion. "Could be interesting...." She paused purposely. "If you let me drive the boat."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Lacy was shocked at her daughter's continued attitude. </p>
		<p>"No. That's okay." Gage sent an engaging smile to Lacy, then redirected her attention to Dani who took serious note of the silent exchanges between her mother and the stranger. "How ?bout tomorrow we have a boat ride and check out the cave from the water?"</p>
		<p>With a quick glance to her mother, Dani displayed her best behavior. "Yes, that would be delightful. Thank you." Dani turned to leave.
			<i>Except for the boat ride and that cave, tomorrow may just very well be the longest day of my life. What's up with those looks anyway? </i>Dani didn't turn back as she continued on her way to their cabin.
		</p>
		<p>"I don't know what has gotten in her today. Ever since we've arrived, she's been...withdrawn. She's usually outgoing ...." Looking at Derek, she continued. "And he's the shy one. But you couldn't tell by the way things have gone today. He never takes to strangers. Never."</p>
		<p>Gage stroked Derek's soft cheek causing him to blush shyly with a sweet smile directed at his new best friend. "Tomorrow then?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely." Lacy reluctantly turned to leave, but Derek reached for Gage again. Lacy allowed her clearance as Gage stepped closer and Derek planted a wet kiss on her cheek.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Goodbye." Gage watched as Lacy turned away. </p>
		<p>Shaking her head at her son's uncharacteristic display, Lacy walked quietly back to their cabin resisting the urge to look back over her shoulder at the enigmatic woman who affected her so.</p>
