<!-- The Woman I Love \ Epilogue: Four weeks later -->

<p>Settled in temporarily at Gage's home, Lacy and the kids were preparing for their return to Hollywood the next week for the start of the star's movie.</p>
		<p>Lounging back on the bed, Gage waited for her lover to finish tucking in the kids. With her hands propped up behind her blonde head, Gage wiggled her eyebrows seductively when Lacy entered.</p>
		<p>Lacy bypassed her eagerly waiting lover heading to the dresser then sorted through one of the drawers. She shoved it back then rifled through another one. That search didn't yield what she was looking for so she pushed around the clothes Gage haphazardly slung over a chair.</p>
		<p>"Lost something?" Gage inquired.</p>
		<p>"No." Dropping several pieces of clothes after each inspection. Frustrated, Lacy's shoulders drooped. "It's more like something I missed."</p>
		<p>"Can I help you find it?" Keenly eager to get on with the nightly activities, Gage started to rise. </p>
		<p>"No. You're not going to find it." Lacy offered vaguely, still sorting through some clothes. Then yanked a red nightgown from the behind the chair where Gage had flung it last night. Lacy quickly shed her clothes and slipped on the scantily clad nightgown, which barely reached the top of her thighs, showcasing her long, sexy legs.</p>
		<p>"And you expect that to stay on for long?" Playfully teasing Lacy. When Lacy turned to her lover, Gage easily recognized distressed blue eyes capture her completely. "What's wrong?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing I hope." Lacy unintentionally walked seductively to the bed, lifting her knee up on the side next to Gage, sitting down.</p>
		<p>Gage splayed her hand over Lacy's soft thigh, rubbing it tenderly, allowing her lover all the time she needed. </p>
		<p>"I'm not really missing anything." Lacy sighed. "I'm pregnant."</p>
		<p>Not missing a beat, opening her arms wide, Gage beckoned. "Come here."</p>
		<p>Finding comfort in Gage's arms, a shudder followed the tears Lacy shed.</p>
		<p>"I thought you wanted more kids." Gage reminded the younger woman.</p>
		<p>Moving back, Lacy intently stared into green searching for any hint of displeasure with the news. "I did. I do. But... what.... how do you feel about it?"</p>
		<p>Shrugging, Gage let a slip of jealousy shine through. "I didn't like it one bit, but he was...is, at least for a few more months, your husband. I figured you... you know, the night he arrived at the cabin."</p>
		<p>"I mean about the baby." Lacy corrected her.</p>
		<p>As if drawn like a compass needle to the North Pole Gage's hand made its way to Lacy's firm, flat stomach, resting there. "I love you and Dani and Derek and I already love... your baby."</p>
		<p>Falling on Gage's chest, Lacy let forth a stream of tears. "I love you. You know that?"</p>
		<p>"I know that."</p>
		<p>Deploying her amorous body into action, Lacy maneuvered for a better position. "And now I'm gonna love you." With those words, Lacy seized the writer's lips, moaning at the contact. Lacy's tongue brushed against her lover's mouth slipping past warm lips before her tongue swirled into the inviting cavern. </p>
		<p>The younger woman's hand kept busy, roaming over every inch of the body she'd come so familiar with in the last five weeks. Having taken a reluctant vacation from their nightly lovemaking during the week they visited Lacy's parents, the lovers resumed their bedtime ritual with diligent resolve. </p>
		<p>"Get this off." Lacy jerked the jersey off then hurriedly moved to free her lover of her cotton shorts. The dark haired woman settled between Gage's legs, grinding her hips seductively causing her lover to groan in delight. </p>
		<p>Gage met stroke for stroke, intending on taking control of the situation. Staking claim to her lover's lips, Gage sent Lacy spiraling, out of control. Falling into the vortex of the powerful sensations from the kiss, Lacy lost all conscious thought of anything, but the sweet, seductive contact she savored on her own lips only feeling the licking, sucking wet touch that sent shivers through her oversensitive body. Gage's unrelenting hands were doing their part in distracting the star as they glazed over the soft curve of Lacy's breast.</p>
		<p>Summoning every resource she could muster, Lacy broke the kiss. Determined, Lacy vowed. "I will have my way with you." </p>
		<p>Intent fully on the target below her, Lacy's hands found their way down the writer's side, savoring the soft yet solid curve of Gage's hips as she left a path of quick kisses down the blonde's neck along her collarbone finally taking root over a waiting breast. </p>
		<p>Sucking the breast into her hungry mouth, Lacy couldn't help, but grin when Gage pushed up against her allowing a loud moan to escape. Gage wrapped her arms tightly around her lover, willing her to stay forever.</p>
		<p>On the verge of meeting heaven on earth, Lacy husked. "I love you, Gage." Lacy's hand slithered along the top of her lover's thigh cresting briefly at the top of the blonde's nexus before venturing to the nether region. Coaxing, teasing fingers delivered to its bounty a crescendo of pleasure, washing over the woman below her. Sending her lover over the edge having taken her to the place where their souls met again, reuniting for the journey that led to forever.</p>
		<p>Slowly coming back from the precipice, with a heavy shudder, tears spilled forth unchecked from rapturous green eyes. The love that Gage desperately longed for came as a crashing wave, filling her completely breaking the emotional dam she'd kept in check all her life. </p>
		<p>"Sweetheart, what's wrong?" Lacy anxiously asked.</p>
		<p>A tremble vibrated through her desire-spent body. "I just.... love you so very much." </p>
		<p>As Gage wept, Lacy lured her lover closer, claiming those luscious lips again. "I love you."</p>
		<p>After a soul melding kiss, Lacy draped her body over her lover. Between her husbands and all the leading men she had kissed, Lacy luxuriated in the fact that Gage was the best kisser that ever crossed her lips. Wrapped in Gage's loving arms, Lacy smiled in contentment. "This is where I want to spend the rest of my life."</p>
