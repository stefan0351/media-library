	<chapter title="Chapter Seventeen">
		<p>As Dani guided the boat to dock under Gage's supervision, they saw the fair's skyline against a cloudless sky. Derek tried to leap from his mother's arm to get closer to the festive sound of carnival music playing that inevitability drew children like a magnet. Boat anchored securely to the dock, the foursome walked the short distance to the fairgrounds. </p>
		<p>Derek could hardly contain himself, scrambling out of his mother's arms onto the ground, making a beeline to the yellow rubber ducks floating in a small pond. "Ducky." He leaned over the short tank, grabbing at one of the ducks, on the verge of falling in until his mother rescued him from a certain watery fate. Pulling him back up in her arms, Derek ripped a huge smile across his face with his prize in hand. </p>
		<p>The carnie cast a sharp eye at the young child and was about to protest when Gage stepped up between them. Knowing full well Derek would not part with his new friend. "Listen, sir. How bout I give you....." She jammed her hand in her pocket retrieving some money. "A twenty... for the duck."</p>
		<p>"No can do." He scratched his week old beard. "But you can play." </p>
		<p>So Gage, along with Dani and Lacy, selected numerous ducks, flipping them over to see what they didn't win. Derek was oblivious to the outcome; he was already a happy little camper.</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Lacy whispered to Gage.</p>
		<p>A confused look washed over the writer's face. "David would have made him put the duck back." A pause. "He's a bit frugal with his money."</p>
		<p>This made Gage smile, thinking.
			<i>Twenty dollars was a drop in the bucket...pond, </i>she amended.
			<i>Compared to that smile the kid now wore.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Dani decided to take charge of her crew and led them directly to the Ferris wheel. She wanted to ride high on the round machine so she could see where everything was located. "First stop, Ferris wheel."</p>
		<p>Dani rode with her mother while Gage escorted the three year old. He scooted closer as the chair rose higher and higher in the air. Dani waved frantically to Derek from the chair above them before her mother settled her daughter back down. </p>
		<p>As if on cue, Dani's got her wish when her chair stopped at the very peak of the wheel. "There's the scrambler." She squealed. "And we have to go ride that round thing over there."</p>
		<p>Following her daughter's arm aim, Lacy noted. "I think that's the ring of fire."</p>
		<p>"Cool." Then her attention diverted to a building like structure across from the ring of fire. "Is that a fun house?" Dani leaned over the chair's rail causing it to tip forward. "Derek, you want to go to the fun house?" She yelled below.</p>
		<p>Lacy tried to equalize the rocking motion her daughter started, pulling her back. "Dani, you can ask him when we get down from this." Lacy didn't really mind heights exactly though she was dubious of it. There was a near accident on the set of her show when her harness slipped, plummeting her to the ground only to stop a few feet from the hard concrete floor. She sucked in a deep breath, willing the chair to still and it did. But only for a brief moment before the carnie started the wheel on it's circular journey.</p>
		<p>Finally on the ground, Lacy suggested they have some lunch before taking any more rides. The high carb and all too sweet lunch served up did nothing to settle her stomach. So they decided to visit some of the farm animals to Derek's delight and Dani's consternation. She was the kinda girl that liked action.</p>
		<p>Gage was all too happy to go along with whatever they wanted, savoring the time spent with what she had come to think of as her new family. She knew it was wishful thinking, but then again sometimes dreams do come true.</p>
		<p>At last, Dani was leading her gang toward the fun house when Derek spied a big yellow giraffe that you would think the kid couldn't live without the way he was carrying on.
			<i>I'll never get to the fun house at this rate. And we can't go on rides hauling that big thing around. </i> "Can't we do that later?"
		</p>
		<p>Her mother shot her a look that offered the young girl no alternative. Dropped shoulders gave away her resolve. "Then let's get on with it."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Lacy said sharply, letting her daughter know that indignant tone was not acceptable. "This is a family outing. We all get to do something we want."</p>
		<p>Lacy's words regarding family did not go unnoticed by Gage. The smile on her face shown brightly and even someone in a space shuttle overhead would have easily seen it. So ecstatic by her companion's words, Gage picked up the rifle on the table in front of her positive she would win the big yellow giraffe for Derek.
			<i>Apparently, Derek's favorite color is yellow. </i> This was another fact she would stow away for later.
		</p>
		<p>Slapping some money on the table, Gage took careful aim. Twenty dollars later, she still hadn't got pass winning a couple of small gray elephants. Looking the rifle over, she demanded. "Got another one? This one's sights are off." Shaking his head, the carnie offered her a third rifle.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>With the last shot being fired and missed, Lacy took pity on her. "Here." Lacy traded her son for the rifle. Two dollars and three perfect shots later, Derek had his giraffe.</p>
		<p>Lacy shrugged, looking directly at Gage. "I learned to shoot on the show."</p>
		<p>With Derek in her arms and the giraffe wrapped in his arms, Gage strolled off. "Yeah, well, some people are just lucky. What'd ya say we hit that fun house."
			<i>I should be able to do that without embarrassing myself.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy rolled her eyes, holding a smirk firmly on her face.
			<i>I think I bruised someone's ego.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"It's about time." Dani skipped off.</p>
		<p>As they waited in line, Dani felt someone staring. She twisted her head around from side to side, intently taking in the crowd. </p>
		<p>"What is it?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Her eyes fell on the young man moving behind her mother. "It's him."</p>
		<p>Ned, followed closely by his friend, Buddy, bumped into the star. </p>
		<p>"Excuse me." Lacy turned, paling when her concerned blue eyes rested on the two teens. </p>
		<p>Startled, both Ned and Buddy froze in place until a heated liberating voice thawed their bodies. "Ned, get up here!" Ned and his friend jumped ahead, joining his mother in the line near the steps of the fun house.</p>
		<p>"That's Mrs. Raye and her son." Dani informed Gage.</p>
		<p>"I know. And that's Ned's friend." Nodding her head in landlord's direction, Gage asked. "Who's that guy with them?"</p>
		<p>Dani shrugged as Lacy answered. "The handyman, Ralph. Remember, I told you about him when I went back to the cabin that next day."</p>
		<p>He finally turned around facing them. Ralph's mean brown eyes surveyed the couple then landed squarely on Dani. Her mother pulled her closer out of his view waiting until he turned back around.</p>
		<p>Having now recognized Sally Raye's handyman, Gage asked. "Do you want to do this later?" Concern written all over her face.</p>
		<p>Dropping her eyes to her daughter, Lacy nodded. "No. We're fine."</p>
		<p>Dani jumped in the two-seated cart. She shared the front seat with her mother and as usual Gage and Derek partnered up again in the backseat, with giraffe tagging along. </p>
		<p>The fun house turned out to be a haunted house, starting out with a ride through a long, dark and scary tunnel filled with objects meant to be menacing to its guests. At the end, they had to take a short walk out of a semi-lit corridor that led to the exit.</p>
		<p>Dani loved it, making bloodcurdling sounds of her own while Derek climbed on Gage's lap. When the ride was over, Dani jumped from the cart while Lacy helped her son out and Gage wrestled with the giraffe. Dani ran ahead down the dark corridor unmindful of any danger that might lie in its wake. </p>
		<p>When Lacy heard the scream sail down the corridor, she scrambled ahead leaving Gage to take care of her son. Lacy approached an older man from behind, jerking him around as he was about to lean forward to where her frighten daughter stood. "What the hell are you doing?" She demanded, recognizing the handyman instantly. </p>
		<p>Gage caught up with her, taking a place next to Dani, pulling her out of the line of fire from the anticipated altercation. "Come here." </p>
		<p>"What's it to ya?" The irascible handyman spat back, letting go of the whistle wrapped around the young girl's neck. "Damn girl, just started screaming."</p>
		<p>The protective mother clenched her fist, cocked and ready to fire even though it hung at her side. Through clenched teeth, she summoned all of her tolerance. "I suggest you get out of here...NOW!" The command left no room for doubt.</p>
		<p>Ralph backed up a few steps. "You people are all alike. You think you're better than everyone else. Well, I got news for......" </p>
		<p>Stepping forward, Lacy loomed over the short man, cutting off any more of his spiteful retort. Ralph reasoned retreat was the better part of valor even though he didn't know what it meant. </p>
		<p>Scampering off quickly, hoping to catch up with Sally and let her know he'd stood up for her. Ralph, who had cared for Sally for years, appointed himself her protector, which automatically made him Ned's protector, too. She'd let him hang around knowing full well he was in love with her even though Sally was just using him. It was nice having your very own puppy dog and she got him to do her bidding no matter how nasty. </p>
		<p>Ralph listened well when his love ranted that if it weren't for that high kaflutten movie star seducing her innocent son into returning to the cabin, Ned wouldn't be in trouble with the law. They both ignored the fact that nothing came of the break in since no one filed any charges. </p>
		<p>Lacy rushed to her daughter. "Are you all right?" Running her hands over Dani's face and arms, looking for any sign of harm, Lacy heaved a sigh in relief. </p>
		<p>"He just scared me... a bit." Dani assured her.</p>
		<p>Fussing the young girl's dark hair, Gage subtly altered Dani's perception of her admission. "You did good, yelling like that. I think though that you scared him." Gage presented a knowing wink.</p>
		<p>Perking up considerably. "I did, didn't I?" Her mother confirmed her own approval, giving her daughter a wink too. "What next?"</p>
		<p>"Ducks." Derek piped up.</p>
		<p>Rolling her blue eyes in surrender, Dani remembered her mother's words about the family outing. "Ducks it is then." A short pause. "Again."</p>
		<p>Derek splashed the water in the duck pond much to the vendor's dismay, but he was helplessly to do anything when Lacy flashed him an endearing smile when she asked permission that he swore actually curled his toes. Of course, he would never admit that out loud.
			<i>What would the rest of the carnies think? </i>
		</p>
		<p>A few rides later that included the scrambler, the ring of fire and the flying fisherman's boat, the newly formed family was ready to call it a day. Even Dani admitted to being all tuckered out. Derek rested his sleepy head on his mother's shoulder, arms wrapped securely around the little rubber duck while Dani latched onto Gage's right hand since the other one was dutifully carrying the giraffe.</p>
		<p>After the short walk to the boat in the dark, they carefully negotiated the dock lit only by a few lanterns. Gage settled Dani down on the back seat. </p>
		<p>"I'm tired." She declared, laid down and closed her eyes, but not before claiming the giraffe as he bed partner. </p>
		<p>Lacy stepped over the gunwale onto the boat. She laid her son on the other bench, pulling out a couple of extra shirts from her bag then covered both her children. </p>
		<p>Gage fired up the engine then started to get out of the boat, but was stopped when Lacy grabbed her shoulder. "Here. Let me." She jumped out of the boat, unleashed the ropes attached to the dock, flipping them back in the boat. As she raised her foot, it slipped on the side of the boat. Unbalanced, Lacy fell forward into the surprised and delighted arms of the writer, knocking them back onto the captain's seat.</p>
		<p>When hopeful blue met welcoming green illuminated by the lanterns, both knew the pivotal moment had arrived. They felt the crackling current of energy running between them, pounding on the door as loudly as Lacy's heart thundered against her chest. She begged admission into the entryway of Gage's heart. Zeroing in on the luscious targeted lips before her, any doubt in the star's mind crusaded past emotional and social barriers long standing, crumbling like the wall of Jericho.</p>
		<p>For Gage, a riot of sensations cannoned through her fully alert tingling body. The gaze in Lacy's penetrating blue eyes threatened to steal Gage's breath away. What she had long desired, poised a finger's width away, and on the verge of receiving as breaths mingled in delicious anticipation of fireworks primed to ignite at the sweet touch of their lips was at hand. </p>
		<p>The tenderness of the kiss was staggering. Warm lips brushed against inviting ones in a dance so intoxicating they would both swear later they heard a harp play and blue birds soared high into the sky creating a vortex in which the two would be lovers lost themselves. Savoring the sensual kiss of the writer's lips, Lacy's mouth lounged there for what she hoped would be eternity, soaking in the depth of love she felt course through her body, filling it to the brim. </p>
		<p>Suddenly, sensing they were being watched, Gage began the unbelievable task of bringing their first kiss to a close. While in retreat, Gage stole kiss after kiss, each shorter than the one before, but not in its intensity. </p>
		<p>Swallowing hard, Lacy gasped. "That was nice." Allowing her head to rest against Gage's flushed face.</p>
		<p>The deep breath she took shuttered through her body. "Nice?"</p>
		<p>"Mmmmmm." Lacy moaned. "Very nice."</p>
		<p>Shifting her head around covertly, searching for an intruder. "Well, that's a step up, I guess."</p>
		<p>Lacy repositioned her forehead; laying it against Gage, nose touching nose. "I've never been kissed like that before."</p>
		<p>"Baby, I need some clarification here...good or bad... and I need it now." Gage insisted, waiting on baited breath for the verdict. </p>
		<p>"Very good." Ducking her head back down to capture the writer's lips again. "Very, very good." She stole another kiss, although Gage would gladly give them away free of charge. "As a matter of fact..." Lacy dropped her voice to its lowest register. "That's the best kiss I've ever received."</p>
		<p>Just before Gage reclaimed the star's inviting lips, she smiled. "Now you're talking."</p>
		<p>The shadow lurking near the boat dock slipped away having seen enough.
			<i>Now I have you right where I want you. </i>
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>It was a long ride home in the cool, dark night as Gage guided the boat back to their cabin. The kids never woke on the trip, easily putting them to bed.</p>
		<p>It was inevitable that they would share a bed tonight and every other night if they had their way. Silently, as they readied for bed both lulled in deep thought. Unbeknownst to the other, sharing the same feelings about the kiss, the night, tomorrow and their future. Two roads had finally merged into one, forever linked. </p>
		<p>Slipping into bed, Lacy crawled into the writer's waiting arms. Snuggling ever closer, Gage's wandering hands had a mind all their own. They cuddled and kissed, lazing against each other allowing soft moans of pleasure to escape. Grabbing at Lacy's white v-neck tee shirt, Gage suggested seductively. "Let's take your clothes off so they don't get in the way."</p>
		<p>With Gage's persistent hands roaming her body unchecked, Lacy replied seriously. "I don't think my clothes are hindering your hands any." A smile appeared briefly before she claimed the writer's lips on the verge of objecting. </p>
		<p>Protest stymied before it had a chance to be verbalized, Gage savored the defeat, becoming a willing participant in her own remonstration's demise. "I could do this forever."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Yes, forever. </i> That idea brought a chilling effect. Lacy pulled away slightly, breathless from the last kiss. "Gage, sweetheart....." The insistent lips that attacked the star's neck distracted her momentarily. "Ahh...sweetheart, please." Unrelenting hands glided over the curve of her full, firm breast, pausing just the briefest of moments, Lacy moaned.
			<i>Oh, God, that was nice.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>"What?" Gage asked weakly, leaving a trail of soft kisses down Lacy's neck to her collarbone.</p>
		<p>"Sweetheart."
			<i>You are driving me to distraction, </i>Lacy thought, powered by the traveling hands of the writer. "We need to talk." It took all her effort, but she finally got it out.
		</p>
		<p>"Okay." Gage said, but never stopped her sensual assault on the willing respondent. </p>
		<p>Lacy reasoned she had to do something and fast before things went too far. A plan formulated quickly.
			<i>I've got one shot at this in order to get her full attention. </i> Corralling every feeling she held for the writer presently making mad, passionate love to her, Lacy commanded the lips before her, claiming them fully and conquered Gage, kissing her to exhaustion, sapping every last bit of passion that had just exploded forth from the writer.
		</p>
		<p>Breathless and satiated, Gage fell back on the pillow, eyes closed, head spinning out of control. "Wow." Escaped in a sated sigh. </p>
		<p>"Can we talk now?" Lacy's own words weakly spilled forth, dizzied from the kiss herself. </p>
		<p>Gage's only reply, a wicked smile as dazed eyes slit open, gazing at the woman she loved. </p>
		<p>"I'll take that as a yes." In spite of the look Gage sent her. A long moment passed as Lacy constructed her next words. "I think we should... maybe for now..."</p>
		<p>"Take it slow." Gage supplied, propping herself up on her elbow, she pulled Lacy into a smothering embrace. Whispering in her ear, Gage said the words Lacy struggled to enunciate. "It's the kids." Her lips quickly nuzzled the enticing ear next to her mouth, nipping it, then Gage reluctantly moved back to look into concerned blue eyes.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Lacy admitted. "And it's me, too. This is all so soon after...." Her mind traveled the short distance over the last few days reclaiming the memory of David's arrival, his declaration of love for Hayston Rawlings, her former co-star, and the divorce papers she'd so recently signed.</p>
		<p>"Take all the time you want." Gage assured her. "I'll wait for as along as it takes." The quick kiss punctuated the promise. </p>
		<p>"Thank you." Lacy laid her head on Gage's shoulder, draped her arm and long leg over the writer, closed her eyes and quietly whispered. "Goodnight."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eighteen">
		<p>It was pure torture for Gage to drag herself out of bed the next morning. But when the other half of her soul slipped from their warm haven, the emptiness left behind motivated her to get moving.
			<i> After all, the kids will be up soon. I guess it was silly of me to think we could just lounge around in bed all day. </i>Gage tracked Lacy as she walked across the room, well out of reach, only to exit mumbling something about getting something to eat. That thought appealed to the writer in a very perverse way. Thinking of what she'd like to devour, Gage reprimanded herself.
			<i>I have got to get my mind out of the gutter.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy, with a firm handle on getting breakfast ready, spun the knob on the stove, cranked the heat up under the pot of water warming for the oatmeal. </p>
		<p>Gage approached silently from behind, slipped her arms around the star's slender waist. She pulled Lacy close to her, molding their bodies together. Lacy allowed herself a moment to savor this feeling of love permeating her entire being, closing her eyes. The writer dispensed a series of kisses on the actresses neck then kissing her way up, slowly dragging the tip of her tongue along the edge of Lacy's ear. A tantalizing tingle shot through the dark haired woman. After a brief stay playing with Lacy's ear, Gage's chin came to rest on the actresses shoulder.</p>
		<p>Lacy clasped her hands on the arms circling her waist. "That was nice."</p>
		<p>Gage perked up. "What is it with you? Everything is....nice?" Gage taunted with a serious edge of undercurrent flowing through her tone.</p>
		<p>Twisting around in the writer's arms, Lacy touched Gage's cheek, gazing deeply into the profound verdant eyes before her. "Would you rather I use great, wonderful, excellent, outstanding or.....what would you suggest?"</p>
		<p>"Sexy, sensual, superior, stupendous to name a few." </p>
		<p>"Okay, you're wanting something that starts with an &#145;s'. It was....." An impious grin crossed her face. "Super nice." </p>
		<p>"You are wicked. You know that, don't you?" Gage claimed the lips being offered, drowning in the delicious taste of heaven. Gage put all the love she had for Lacy in that kiss, aiming for something beyond &#145;nice' even if it was described as super.
			<i>I'm thinking more like marvelous, out of this world, fabulous, awe-inspiring or......</i>
		</p>
		<p>Breaking from the kiss, Lacy declared breathlessly. "Breathtaking."</p>
		<p>
			<i>That's more like it. </i> Gage reclaimed the star's beckoning lips, spiraling, falling over the precipice into a seductive haze. Until. The boiling water bubbled over the pot, sizzling on the heat below, jerking them out of their revelry.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy twisted out of Gage's embrace, grabbed the pot then sat it down on an empty burner. Rotating back around to the writer, Lacy revealed. "Apparently, I love you to distraction."</p>
		<p>Her simply stated words shocked Gage to the core. She was about to proclaim the love she felt for the woman standing before her until soft footfalls could be heard from the hardwood floor in the hallway. They both stepped back awkwardly. </p>
		<p>Rubbing his sleepy eyes, Derek dragged the giraffe behind him into the kitchen. "Momma." </p>
		<p>"Morning, honey." Lacy swung her son up in her arms. "You hungry?"</p>
		<p>Barely holding onto the giraffe's horn, Derek nodded, wiggling his friend. "He hungry too."</p>
		<p>The sharp shriek of a whistle cut through the morning air. Lacy and Gage practically jumped at the noise of Dani's whistle while Derek just giggled. "Good morning." Dani announced, her voice a little raspy. "What's for breakfast? Captain Crunch?"</p>
		<p>Gage placed a bowl of oatmeal before Dani, but said to Lacy. "I guess the captain here is planning an excursion today."</p>
		<p>"Honey, what's wrong with your voice?" The concerned mother felt her daughter's forehead for fever.</p>
		<p>"Nothing." Dani croaked. "Just a little sore."</p>
		<p>"Mmmm. Maybe must be from all that bloodcurdling screaming you did in the haunted house." Lacy said, giving her a cough drop. "Here."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy hoped to find some time to talk with Gage about the recent developments between them, but they had to tend to the kids first.
			<i>Maybe tonight. </i>A silent exchange of looks between writer and star aligned them on the same wavelength.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Alright then. After breakfast, we'll sail the high seas. Maybe go over to the public beach. Derek will like the playground they have there. Swimming, fishing, games later." Gage was quickly filling up the agenda for the day.</p>
		<p>
			<i>That's it, Gage, a full day of activities for our young brood and they'll be all tuckered out and go to bed extra early. </i>"And if we need to...a long walk."
		</p>
		<p>Dani scrunched her face. "A walk?" Then shrugged. "Okay, if we walk to the cave, that is."</p>
		<p>Lacy cocked her hands on her hips. "No cave. We already did that." She had no desire to make that trek again even though their last expedition brought them back safe and sound. </p>
		<p>Dani caved. "Okay, no cave. Jeez." Unbeknownst to everyone in the room expect for Derek, a devious thought bloomed as a smile widened at the prospect.
			<i>Where there's a will, there's a way. </i>Dani quoted her father. Of course, her father only used that affirmation when it came to his work.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The full day of activities did the trick. Two very tired children crawled into bed, safely tucked in, falling easily as sleep claimed them. Lacy and Gage returned to the living room intent on further exploring their feelings toward each other.</p>
		<p>Before even one word was spoken, the telephone rang. Gage shrugged, reached for the telephone and answered it. "Hello." A brief moment passed before she handed the telephone to Lacy, sitting next her.</p>
		<p>Lacy grabbed it. "Hello."</p>
		<p>"How's my favorite client?" Arthur Graham asked, nervously tapping his pencil against the script he'd just finished reading.</p>
		<p>"Oh, hello Art." Lacy mouthed &#145;my agent' to Gage. "We're fine here. Having a great time actually." The star said with a smile and a wink to Gage. Scooting closer, Gage wrapped her arms around Lacy's shoulders. "What's up?"</p>
		<p>"Not a thing. Just wanted to touch base." Arthur said nonchalantly. </p>
		<p>"Ummm Hmm. Why don't I believe that?" Lacy was always suspicious when her agent called &#145;to touch base'. The underlining message usually meant trouble.</p>
		<p>"You've got my number." Arthur cleared his throat. He knew Lacy, unlike other clients, didn't like beating around the bush. "I heard a crazy rumor."</p>
		<p>"You mean the divorce." Lacy stated simply.</p>
		<p>"What! What divorce?" The ball came out of left field and hit him squarely on his balding head. "Where's David?"</p>
		<p>"In California, I'm sure." Lacy wished she'd have waited for her agent to deliver his news before she had to undertake this subject with him. "He wants a divorce, brought the papers out here a few days ago. I signed. End of story."</p>
		<p>"You already gave me the end, now I want the beginning. When did this happen?" Arthur was bordering on the edge of becoming frantic. It wasn't that he liked David so much. Together they made a powerful couple in Hollywood. And from an agent's point of view, his client was served up better opportunities and had the inside track with a producer for a husband. Of course, being married to one of the most beautiful women in the world who also just happened to be a great actress bode well for the up and coming producer.</p>
		<p>"At first, I'd have said it came out of nowhere when he showed up with the papers, but upon further reflection, I'd say it started around four years ago. Slowly but surely our marriage eroded along the way. And then there's Hayston." Lacy added.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Hayston! </i>Arthur Graham found out purely by accident about a year ago that David was having an affair with Hayston. He debated time and time again about telling Lacy, hoping that David would tire of the demanding actress. Arthur always pictured Hayston Rawlings sharpening her nails at the break of dawn before emerging from her dark abyss preying on anyone who could further her career. The twenty-three year old actress learned the Hollywood ropes quickly, coiling some of her own as she played the game with expertise.
		</p>
		<p>Silence on the telephone line prompted Lacy. "Arthur. You still there."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that." Arthur knew his thirty-year-old client was, even at that age, all too trusting. Lacy tended to take things at face value. "Are you sure it has to come to this?"</p>
		<p>"Is this about my career?"</p>
		<p>"No! I'm concerned about you, that's all." He assured her.</p>
		<p>"I'll be fine. Divorce isn't something new in Hollywood. It happens all time." Darting her eyes to Gage who locked onto the loving green gaze like a port in a storm. "Believe me." A long slender finger traveled down Gage's jaw line, sending shivers through her. </p>
		<p>"If you say so." Sucking in a deep breath. "There's something else. And it is about your career."</p>
		<p>Lacy waited.</p>
		<p>"I got a call. Anonymous. But for some reason, it sounds legit. They knew where you are and described your kids. The caller said that you've.... you are engaged in....oh, hell, Lacy. They saw you kissing a woman and say they have pictures. And while this may not be new in Hollywood, it doesn't happen all the time. Careers take a nasty and, may I say, hasty nose dive on something like this."</p>
		<p>"Are they blackmailing me?" Lacy asked. At these words, Gage's smiling eyes turned cold.</p>
		<p>"No. Said they thought I should know before the world did. Their words." Arthur made a decision. "I'm here for you, Lacy. No matter what."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Art." </p>
		<p>If Art had wanted her to confirm or deny this accusation, he didn't ask. He respected her and stifled the question on the tip of his tongue. "I know you planned to stay there another few weeks, but it seems someone has been keeping close watch on your.....activities."</p>
		<p>"It appears so." Lacy admitted. "Art, how far reaching would something like this be?"</p>
		<p>"That depends on what this mysterious caller does. If they actually got pictures ...trouble or if it's just a rumor, it will blow over until something better comes along. You know how Hollywood is." Art said. "However, if it's true and you decide to go public.....I'm afraid.... To be honest, Lacy, I don't know. Things have come a long way." But that hint of society's promising acceptance died on his lips.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Art. I plan on staying here unless my.....spy, stalker, whatever tries something. You will let me know if anything else comes up."</p>
		<p>"Will do." With these words, Art placed the telephone back on its cradle, walked to the window and regurgitated the content of the mystery call once again.</p>
		<p>While talking with her agent, Gage noticed Lacy shift slightly back away from her embrace. The phone call over, Lacy fell into deep thought. Finally, Lacy related the content of the call to Gage.</p>
		<p>"Worried about your career?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not so much worried about my career. My kids, however, and how it will affect them is paramount on my mind. It's not just about us, but the divorce, everything. Dani adores her father." Downcast blue eyes refused to meet concerned green ones. "It had to be last night at the fair when we kissed."</p>
		<p>"I know." Gage bolted off the couch. "Damn it, there was a moment last night when I felt someone was watching us." A reflective pause. "But I...I got sidetracked."</p>
		<p>Even through the turmoil of the news that spun around in Lacy's head, Gage's admission brought a smile to the star's face. "Gage, it's late and I need to think. Do you mind?"</p>
		<p>"No, not at all. You want to go to bed?" Offered innocently.</p>
		<p>Shifting her eyes away from the writer's intense look. "I think I'll stay up. Maybe sleep in the other....with Derek tonight." This scenario wasn't what she craved, but it offered her a safe haven from the ubiquitous magnetic pull she felt around the writer. Lacy wanted nothing more than to retrace time and allow the telephone to ring and not be the carrier of this devastating news. She was not stupid, a little too trusting at times. No, Lacy knew exactly how this would affect her career. It seemed her greatest fear had become reality. It reminded her of her own words spoken not so long ago to Gage.
			<i>My greatest fear is that one day my private life will come into direct conflict with my professional life and I'll have to choose one or the other. </i>Now that choice loomed over her like a dark cloud. She prayed it would have a silver lining.
		</p>
		<p>"You want me to leave you alone, huh?" Feeling rejected, the writer's shoulders slumped.</p>
		<p>"I didn't mean it that way."</p>
		<p>Kneeling back down on the couch, Gage took Lacy's hand in hers. "Listen, Lacy, I want to help. Please don't push me away. No matter what becomes of us..." Motioning between them. "If nothing else happens, I still want us to be friends. I want to be there for you."</p>
		<p>Bringing the writer's hand up to her lips, she kissed it. "Thank you. I could sure use a friend about now."</p>
		<p>"Always." A bright smile peeked through the gloom that hung heavily in the room. "We could just sit here a while.... if you want to talk."</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Nineteen">
		<p>Lacy's original plan to avoid sleeping in the same bed with Gage was derailed. After her agent dumped the disturbing news on her, she sought a distance between them in order to think without having the intoxicating pull between them claim her. Yet, early morning brought a sleepy Lacy waking in the safe and comforting arms of the writer as they both lay on the couch. When Lacy shifted slightly so she could see the blond better, Gage's green eyes slowly lifted.</p>
		<p>"Guess my reluctance to share your bed last night was for nothing since we ended up sleeping together anyway." She found humor in her failed plan.
			<i>Of course, my heart wasn't really in that decision.</i>
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>In the distance, Gage heard a hammer banging. The noise came from the general direction of the cabin Lacy had rented. Her attention returned to Derek and Dani playing along the shoreline. She allowed nagging thoughts to wash over her regarding her feelings about Lacy and the call the star received from her agent last night, interrupted only by the insistent noise Dani made with her whistle. It seemed that every time Dani discovered a rock that was worthy of her collection, she would blow the whistle proclaiming it to the world</p>
		<p>Watching Dani peruse several rocks, Gage sighed heavily.
			<i>That was a close call this morning. </i>While Lacy fixed breakfast, the kids and Gage waited patiently at the table. When the toast popped up out of the toaster, seeing Lacy with her hands full, Gage jumped up. "I'll get it."
		</p>
		<p>Absent mindedly, Lacy replied. "Thank you, sweetheart." Then sent the writer a dazzling smile, provoking Gage to return one in kind. </p>
		<p>For one brief moment neither woman noticed both of Dani's eyebrows jerk up taking refuge under her dark bangs at her mother's words. Shifting her curious blue eyes from mother to Gage then back to Lacy, Dani waited for an explanation that never came. Instead, Lacy's words stumbled forth. "I mean, we can.. eat short...ly...... anytime now.
			<i>Great, she'll really believe I meant to say eat short...ly instead of sweetheart. </i>It was clear to everyone except Derek that Dani was unconvinced. Except for Dani's request for a cough drop for her sore throat, breakfast was a quiet affair.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy used the quiet morning to read the writer's screenplay. Gage insisted that as Lacy read the story, she and the kids would spend some quality time together outside. As she read the story, Lacy only allowed one thought to distract her. It was of Gage. Determined, she vowed, she could not and would not give up this woman who had become such an important part of her life.
			<i>No, she has become my life.</i> The only obstacles that would fall in the way of her declaration where Gage was concerned came in the form of two pairs of eyes. One set gray like his father and the other set matched her own.
			<i>My children. </i>What happened that morning at breakfast did not stray far from her mind.
		</p>
		<p>When the sound of hammering stopped, Gage noticed Dani slipping further up the shoreline toward Cabin C. The writer shot a quick glance to find Derek only a few feet behind her and took hold of his tiny hand. He insisted on walking along side her. All morning Dani kept a distance from the writer lost in her own thoughts about what transpired between her mother and Gage.</p>
		<p>The writer was concerned, but felt helpless to do anything. When Gage and Derek reached the knoll between the two cabins, the writer caught sight of Dani playing at the water's edge. She observed Dani twist around slowly, staring back to shore. Gage tracked the direction in which the young girl was keenly glaring only to find an older man intently watching Dani.</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Gage yelled. "Come here."</p>
		<p>It didn't take long for dark haired girl to obey the command.</p>
		<p>"Dani, you stay here with Derek." She directed, keeping a close eye on the stranger who turned to walk away. "Mister, wait up." Gage shouted. Rushing up behind the man, Gage grabbed at his arm jerking him around. "Hey, I asked you to wait." Easily recognizing him now. "Ralph, was that you I heard hammering?"</p>
		<p>"What's it to ya?" His irascible nature raised its hideous head.</p>
		<p>"Just wondering." Gage said, narrowing her green eyes. "You seemed to be taking quite an interest in the young girl. First at the fair and again now... I saw you watching her pretty closely."</p>
		<p>"You're nuts. I weren't watching nobody. And what would the likes of you do about if I were?" Ralph taunted. </p>
		<p>The writer stepped closer. "If I catch you anywhere near either child or Mrs. Levine, for that matter, you'll wish you'd never came into contact with the likes of me." She hissed, venom dripping.</p>
		<p>Sharply making an about face, Gage joined the children, taking each of them by the hand. No one looked back to see Ralph let out a nasty snicker as a twisted evil smirk rose up on his weathered face.</p>
		<p>Taking a break from reading the screenplay, Lacy watched the trio head back to the cabin. "Where you been?"</p>
		<p>Dani ran ahead. "Collecting rocks." She rushed past her mother and into the cabin. "I've gotta wash these."</p>
		<p>As Gage and Derek reached the steps, Lacy lifted her son. "You look tired." Then gazed at the writer.</p>
		<p>"It's been a full morning. Finished the story?" Gage asked, stepping past the star on the porch.</p>
		<p>"No. Thought I'd come outside for a while. Get some sun while I read." </p>
		<p>"And we we're just heading in." Gage smiled. "Are you sure you don't want to join us?"</p>
		<p>Lacy handed her son to Gage. "Tempting, but I better stick to my original plan if I want to finish this screenplay. You guys would be too much of a distraction."</p>
		<p>"Go on then." Noticing Dani was nowhere near. "She's been a little distant. Not saying much at all. Oh, and Ralph's up near the other cabin. Caught him watching Dani."</p>
		<p>"What happened?" A frantic edge clipped her voice. </p>
		<p>"I talked to him." Gage stroked the star's arm in silent comfort. "I don't think he's gonna hang around anymore. But stay close. Okay?"</p>
		<p>"I will." Lacy smiled. "If Dani comes back out, tell her I'll be on the dock."</p>
		<p>Nodding, Gage longed to give Lacy a quick kiss, but crushed that desire effectively before she walked into the cabin with Derek. "Dani, where are you?"</p>
		<p>"In here. Drying my rocks." Dani called from the bathroom. </p>
		<p>"You're mom's down by the dock reading if you go back out, check with her, okay?" Gage instructed.</p>
		<p>"Right." Dani jiggled the pile of rocks, wrapped in the towel, dry. She tossed them on her bed and began sorting them by size.
			<i>These are pretty, but I saw some real nice ones in that cave. Oh yes, the cave. </i> That thought was like a siren calling her, begging her, cajoling her to come. It was in a trance like state that Dani followed the call, formulating a plan as she went.
		</p>
		<p>Hastily gathering her rocks in one of the drawers near her bed, Dani made a mental list of the things she'd need. Walking out to the living room, Dani noted Gage in the kitchen with Derek, getting some water. "I'm heading outside." Her whistle securely wrapped around her neck. </p>
		<p>Gage didn't notice the young girl had changed into a pair of jeans instead of the shorts she wore earlier. "Okay. You're mom's at the dock." The writer's attention was glued on the three year old about to tip his glass too high. </p>
		<p>The sneaky eight-year-old slipped out the cabin door. Seeing her mother in one of the loungers on the dock reading, Dani slipped inside the boathouse, retrieving a flashlight. She paused momentarily to stare at the rope, but decided against taking it. With a quick peek around the corner to her self-absorbed mother, Dani tipped toed slowly over the wood dock onto the grass. She crept up behind the tree line then took a path less traveled in the direction of the cave. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>An hour later Lacy walked back into the cabin having finished the screenplay. Immediately she noticed asleep on the couch were two of her favorite people. Derek, perched on top of Gage, slept peacefully. Gage with one arm wrapped over the young boy was in her own tranquil slumber.</p>
		<p>Lacy sat next to them on the coffee table, reaching out, she fussed with her son's dark locks before running the back of her fingers against Gage's soft cheek. The star's touch caused the writer to smile in her sleep. </p>
		<p>Gage leaned into the delicate and welcoming contact. She shifted slightly, stretching her legs before sluggish eyes finally lifted slightly, seeing the beautiful woman she loved before her. "Hi."
			<i>I want to wake up like this forever.</i> Gage wetted her lips finding strays bits of dark hair from Derek who had nestled tightly up against her. Spitting the stray locks out caused Derek to stir.
		</p>
		<p>"Hello sleepy head." Gray eyes brighten upon seeing his mother.</p>
		<p>"Momma." He wiggled against his human pillow.</p>
		<p>"Hi, honey. Come here." Derek vaulted into her arms, kissing her soundly then giggled. "Where's Dani?" Lacy asked, bouncing her son on her knee.</p>
		<p>Rubbing her eyes, Gage stretched, replying off handedly. "She went outside earlier."</p>
		<p>"I didn't see her." Lacy said, concern washing over her face. "She's not in here?"</p>
		<p>Gage bolted off the couch, dashing into every room in the cabin, searching for the young girl. "She's not in here."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" The frightened mother screamed, running out the cabin door with son in hand. "Dani!" Over and over again, Lacy called for her daughter, silence the only answer. Dani was nowhere in sight no matter in what direction the mother looked. Turning to Gage, frantic and near the edge, Lacy sucked in a deep breath. "The cave."</p>
		<p>"Maybe...." She hesitated at the possible scenario, but had to vocalize it. "The handyman, Ralph."</p>
		<p>Shaking her head vehemently. "No, it's the cave. When she came out earlier, she would have stopped to talk with me unless she had something up her sleeve. She had her whistle, didn't she?"</p>
		<p>"I think so. I haven't seen her without it since Derek found it." Gage replied.</p>
		<p>Deep in the recess of a mother's instincts she knew her child held an unnatural obsession for that cave.
			<i>Like mother, like daughter. </i>"We have to go." Lacy darted off.
		</p>
		<p>"Wait." Gage stopped her then ran to the boathouse retrieving the other flashlight and some rope. Gage flipped the light on, showing a bright beam. </p>
		<p>Swallowing hard, Lacy whispered softly. "She's got the one with the battery that's about dead."</p>
		<p>"Let's go." Gage made a short detour to the cabin, grabbing her cell phone. Then the three traveled the path along the shoreline leading directly to the cave.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Not more than a hundred yards away from the cave they heard an engine roar in the distance, tires spinning. Catching the tail end of a beat up old truck, Lacy gasped. "That's the handyman's truck. I noticed it outside the cabin the day the deputy and I was there and Ralph showed up to fix the window in the door." </p>
		<p>Flipping her cell phone on, Gage punched in several numbers. "I'd like to talk with Sheriff Baylor." She waited. "Sheriff, Mrs. Levine's little girl is missing. We think she went to the cave just north of my cabin." A pause. "Yeah, that's the one. But, we just saw Ralph heading down the old Reynolds road. He was high tailing it out of here pretty fast and, well, earlier today he was....hanging around, watching us. I don't know if it's anything..." The sheriff cut her off causing her to listen closely. "Thanks. We're going to search the cave. Lacy...." The concerned mother shot her a look. "One of us will be at the entrance when you get here."</p>
		<p>When they entered the mouth of the cave Gage determined to have Lacy wait with Derek while she searched it looking for the missing girl. "Lacy, I know..."</p>
		<p>"I know what you're going to say, but I know this cave....I was lost in it once." Tears spilled forth. "I know what she's going through."</p>
		<p>"Hold on." Gage took Lacy by both arms, steadying her. "We don't know if her flashlight went dead yet. Let's not get ahead of ourselves." Gage didn't even want to explore the idea that Ralph had taken the girl and was less reluctant to bring it up, but she had too. "The sheriff said he's gonna have one of his deputies pick up Ralph, just in case." Gage could not dismiss the horror that flooded the blue eyes in front of her when she spoke those words. "I don't think that's the case though." The writer said hurriedly in an attempt to calm the emotional woman fraught with fear. </p>
		<p>In an amazing show of self-control and one look at her son who was getting very upset, Lacy calmed the storm raging inside. "I'll stay here then." She pulled her son close, soothing him. "Wait for the sheriff."</p>
		<p>Gage handed her the cell phone, jacked the rope up over her shoulder and flipped the flashlight on. "She'll be alright, I promise." Stepping away then turning back swiftly, Gage embraced Lacy and child, savoring the moment. Before leaving, Gage shut her eyes and brushed her lips against Lacy's cheek.
			<i>I swear I will do everything I can to get her back safely. </i>With that thought, Gage rushed off into the darkness lit only by a stream of light, barely hearing Lacy's parting words.
		</p>
		<p>Dani delved deep into the smaller tunnel, easily negotiating around the rocks and curves of the walls.
			<i>This one is so much more interesting than the bigger one. And I'm sure that old handyman didn't see me. </i>Upon approaching the cave, Dani witnessed Ralph exit it hurriedly, get in his truck and leave. She waited until the vehicle was out of sight then entered the cave on her great adventures.
		</p>
		<p>She traveled down the cavern path for a quarter mile before she sighted the large chamber opening. The pool glittered against the beam of her flashlight. "Wow. This is great." Blue eyes grew in excitement at the sight of the small waterfall, gushing from overhead into the pool.</p>
		<p>Dani didn't notice the illumination from her flashlight grow weaker. Her exhilaration over her discovery was enthralling, ridding her of any common sense as time stood still in this awe-inspiring world, which now belonged to her. "Yes!" She cocked her arm then noticed several objects near a small table like rock. </p>
		<p>The young explorer flashed her light taking in her latest find. To her surprise, Dani saw a poster of her mother dressed as the cop, Samantha Gordon, from her show. She also found several of her mother's things. Holding up a pair of red panties, Dani knew they matched the bra her mother wore sometimes. Darting the light around, searching for more items, the beam flickered over a small area where something shiny flashed out. Zeroing in on it, Dani found her mother's broach. She grabbed it quickly, stuffing it in her pocket.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I am good. I can't wait till mom sees this." Pride beaming from her voice. But the thought of her mother brought her out of her revelry and into darkness as the flashlight died. As pitch dark surrounded her, Dani let the notion that &#145;
			<i>maybe this wasn't such a good idea' </i>cross her mind.
		</p>
		<p>Resolved to get herself out of this predicament just like Mecca did in Gage's story of the Shanglon Master, Dani took stock of her bearing trying to remember where she was standing in conjunction to the where she had entered this part of the cave. Feeling her way along the rock wall, Dani inched forward, calmly reassuring herself.
			<i>I will get out of this. I will get out of this. I am not one of those helpless females. </i>Reluctantly admitting,
			<i>but I could use a little help. </i>Teeth chattering tickled her scratchy sore throat. The jeans kept her legs warm, but her short sleeve shirt did little to protect her against the chill she now felt. The coolness of the cavern went unnoticed when her mind was riveted on exploring the cave. But now, the chillness pierced clear to the bone.
		</p>
		<p>Gage Ballant turned left at the fork in the cave following Lacy's advice. "She's sure to take the small tunnel." Echoed in the writer's head before she let out an ear-piercing echo herself. "Dani!" </p>
		<p>When Dani heard the distant voice barely greet her as a whisper, it startled her causing her to lose her footing, sliding on the slippery rock floor. The dark haired girl scooted back swiftly wondering if Ralph had come back to the cave then catching the steep slope's edge, falling into an unknown abyss. Dani spiraled down the small opening, dropping steadily until she came to rest in a small pool of icy water, tucked neatly in the small cove. Her fingers gripped the mossy rocks above her. Unable to get a decent hold, Dani was trapped.</p>
		<p>The light flickered back and forth across the theater like chamber, searching every nook and cranny, Gage yelled again. "Dani!"</p>
		<p>The freezing cold threatened to over come the young girl, teeth rattling, fingers becoming numb and Dani couldn't even feel her toes. Though now she did recognize Gage's voice shouting for her. A weak attempt to call out died on her lips. The small waterfall in the cavern drowned Dani's calls for help, already weakened from her sore throat.</p>
		<p>Frustrated, Gage yelled again and again, searching for an opening that led further into the cave. The writer followed the beam of light from the flashlight as it traveled over the poster attached to the cave wall with the dark haired woman crouched down pointing a gun at some unseen assailant. In effect, she had discovered inside the chamber a shrine to Lacy Levine. Stepping closer, Gage heeded the welcome shriek of a whistle, blowing persistently at her. "Dani." Gage gravitated to the shrill sound.</p>
		<p>Dani blew harder and harder with all her might, hearing the familiar voice of the writer grow louder. Finally, she halted her summons when it was clear Gage was at the top of the small hole she'd fell into. </p>
		<p>"Dani? Are you okay?"</p>
		<p>Through chattering teeth, Gage heard. "Yessss."</p>
		<p>"How far down there, are you?"</p>
		<p>"I don't knowwwwwww."</p>
		<p>"Okay, listen up. Dani, I've got some rope. I'm gonna lower it down." Gage inched closer over the steep slope, sliding over the mossy rock. Shooting both arms out to her sides, Gage stopped her descent. Breathing heavily, Gage tried to get a secure footing to no avail. One false move and the would be rescuer would need rescuing herself. She grabbed the rope coiled over her shoulder with her teeth, prying it loose which allowed it to slip down her arm. "Dani, do you remember how to tie the bowline knot? You remember, don't you?"</p>
		<p>A pause. "Yessss." Shivering against the cold, she spit out slowly.</p>
		<p>"Good. Now, here it comes." Gage carefully worked the rope over her fingers attached to the rock wall, securing her position then lowered the rope about fifteen feet before it stopped its progression. "Got it?"</p>
		<p>Dani tugged on it.</p>
		<p>"Now, tie it around your waist and I'll pull you up."</p>
		<p>Frozen fingers tried to manipulate the stiff rope. "I...I can't."</p>
		<p>"Yes, you can. Dani, listen, you can do it. I know you can. Come on just tie the rope around you. Okay?" The rescuer asked weakly, allowing the hand of fear grip at her.</p>
		<p>In complete darkness, Dani, against great resistance from the rigid rope, guided it into the knot Gage had shown her. Yanking on it as much as her strength allowed, Dani gave Gage the go ahead. "I got it." </p>
		<p>Gage finally secured a precarious foothold, freeing her hands. Dragging Dani up the small, dark cavity, Gage encouraged Dani to talk. She was well aware of the chill that must be swallowing up the young girl. "I'm fine really.....just cold." Dani helped herself along using her legs, pushing herself upward.</p>
		<p>When Dani reached Gage's unstable position, she directed the young girl to crawl over her. "Climb up me."</p>
		<p>Slow, but methodically, Dani inched up the human wall over her to the top of the slope and with one final push landed safely on top. Finally reaching the top herself, Gage pulled the freezing girl in her strong arms, holding on for dear life. The writer kissed her forehead oblivious to Dani's wet clothes now soaking her own. "Come on. We've got to get you out of here."</p>
		<p>When Gage and Dani emerged into the light, Lacy engulfed her daughters in her arms. "Honey, are you okay?" Lacy's took a moment to let her worried eyes roam over her daughter.</p>
		<p>"Derek, come here." Gage swept up her young charge when she saw the Sheriff approach. "Sheriff."</p>
		<p>Nodding, he tipped his hat. "I see ya found her. We've got Ralph at the station for questioning. He's mad as hell...." Eyeing the kids. "Excuse me."</p>
		<p>"Sheriff." Lacy cut him off sharply. "Can you take us to the hospital? She's too cold." The ice-cold skin she felt alarmed her.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>As the doctor checked out Dani, Gage related what she had found in the cave to the sheriff. He left assuring her that he would get to bottom of it. </p>
		<p>A couple of hours later found Dani dry and completely warmed. The doctor gave her approval to release the patient with strict instruction. The sheriff reappeared just in time to give Gage, Lacy and her kids a ride back to the cabin. He took the time to reveal the results of his investigation after Dani filled in a few blanks.</p>
		<p>"I'm glad you found the broach. You can still press charges if you like." Sheriff Baylor informed her.</p>
		<p>Gazing at her recovering daughter, Lacy shook her head. "No. I'd rather have nothing more to do with them."</p>
		<p>"I hear ya." Baylor agreed. "Anyways, apparently Ralph has been following Ned and his friend, Buddy. That was their secret hiding place in the cave. Sally's been worried about Ned, thinking he was doing drugs, drinking. You know, what most teenagers get into. Had Ralph checking on them. He admitted to following them to the cave, waited for them to leave then followed them again."</p>
		<p>"I saw him when I got to the cave." Dani offered.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, apparently, at least, he claims he never knew you were there."</p>
		<p>"He was spying on my children earlier in the day, sheriff." Lacy stretched the facts a little.</p>
		<p>"Yep, he admitted to being out there, but says he was just making sure Ned wasn't following you like some &#145;love sick puppy dog'. No offense, ma'am, but he don't like you much. Ralph that is." The sheriff said, scooting his hat up to scratch his thinning dark head. "I'll go back to the cave and collect your things and any evidence in case you change your mind."</p>
		<p>"I won't." She said adamantly. "And I don't want any of it. Keep it, throw it away. I don't care."</p>
		<p>The sheriff stopped the car near the cabin. "Here we are." Twisting in his seat to Lacy and her children in the backseat, he assured them. "They won't be bothering ya no more."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Gage and Derek sat out on the porch of the cabin allowing Lacy some time with her daughter. "Hey, kiddo. Come here." </p>
		<p>Derek kept trying to climb up on the rail. "I Debin." He declared to Gage. A little more rambunctious than usual, the small child pulled himself up the rail, reaching out with his short little leg for the swing. </p>
		<p>The writer grabbed for him as he slipped from the rail causing them both to land on the swing. The swing twisted and turned wildly under the unexpected load, releasing an unseen wasp's nest.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Gage." Lacy opened the screen door. "Dani would like to talk to you before she goes to sleep."</p>
		<p>"Oh? Okay." Sitting Derek down, Gage walked past the actress. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy watched Gage make her way across the living room losing sight of her as she turned the hallway corner. Long moments passed as Lacy allowed a welcome relief flood over her knowing the horrible day's events had come to a happy conclusion.</p>
		<p>Gage entered the bedroom, knocking from the door. "Hey, you wanted to see me?"</p>
		<p>"Come on in." A happy, but very tired explorer beckoned.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Gage eased down on the side of the twin bed.</p>
		<p>Dani slipped her small hand over the writer's clasped hands resting on her lap. "You saved me." She stated simply.</p>
		<p>"I may have helped a little. Blowing that whistle was a good idea. And you're the one that tied the rope around you."</p>
		<p>Dani brightened a bit in her sleepy state. "I did, didn't I?" Mulling it over thoughtfully, she continued. "Guess I'm not one of those helpless females."</p>
		<p>"No. No, you certainly are not." Gage confirmed.</p>
		<p>Still standing in the cabin's doorway that feeling of contentment Lacy reveled in sunk rapidly upon seeing her son fall to the porch floor with a yelp, desperately gasping for a breath. "Derek!" Lacy screamed. Derek continued to wheeze and his mother noticed his arm swelling around a red spot.</p>
		<p>Scrambling out onto the porch, Gage stopped short at the sight of Lacy holding her lifeless son. "What's wrong?" </p>
		<p>"I don't know. He just dropped down and....he's having a hard time breathing." The mother loosened his clothes all the while kissing his face checking for fever and offering comfort.</p>
		<p>Scanning the area quickly, Gage honed in on the source of the problem. Wrapped in a sheet Dani hurried through the door as Gage ran back inside, pushing Dani in along with her, heading to the medicine cabinet. </p>
		<p>"Gage!" Lacy yelled.</p>
		<p>Running back outside, Gage stooped down next to mother and child extracting a long tube from its cartoon.</p>
		<p>"What are you doing?" The frightened mother asked.</p>
		<p>"Look up there." Gage nodded toward the porch ceiling. "Dani, get inside now." She yelled at the young girl who peeked back outside, taking a wary step through the door.</p>
		<p>Gage popped the cap off then jabbed the syringe into the small boy's thigh. "There. He'll be okay now." She assured the mother. "But we need to take him to the hospital so they can check him out."</p>
		<p>"Hospital? But..." The mention of hospital did nothing to relieve her fears.</p>
		<p>"Just a precaution and we'll need to get another prescription. Apparently, this little guy is allergic to wasps." Scooping him up, pulling Lacy along up along with them, Gage led mother and child to the safety of the cabin. "Lacy, listen, Derek will be fine. Trust me. My friend, Mark, is allergic to wasps too. He keeps a spare dose of EpiPen here at the cabin." </p>
		<p>Warmed by the trusting green eyes before her, Lacy nodded. "Dani, go get your clothes and bring them out here." Lacy held on tightly to her son who seemed to be making a slow recovery.</p>
		<p>Gage scoured through one of the cabinets in the kitchen. Having found what she was searching for, headed out the screen door. "I'll be right back. That's the last time you little buggers have your way with my family." With diligent determination, Gage exterminated every last one of the wasps before she reentered the cabin, victorious. Any celebration would have to wait. Derek needed tending too.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>As night fell and two trips to the hospital later, Gage found herself surrounded by the people she loved the most in the world. Dani lay next to her mother while Derek staked out a place between her and Gage. All happy and content, sleep claimed them. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty">
		<p>The kids lounged in bed with Gage most of the morning after the hectic day before. Lacy only left the safe and warm haven to answer the ringing telephone.</p>
		<p>"Hello." Lacy sat down on the couch, wrapping her robe around her against the chill of the morning.</p>
		<p>"Lacy, it's David." A serious tone emitted from the receiver.</p>
		<p>"I'm surprised to hear from you, David."</p>
		<p>"I bet you are." The tone changed to one of sarcasm.</p>
		<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
		<p>"Let me get straight to the point." An evil laugh erupted. "Ha, ha, straight to the point. That's a good one." David laughed at his own joke.</p>
		<p>"You've lost me."</p>
		<p>"That's what you keep saying. Listen, bab.... Lacy, you're agent called and....." The way David left his words hanging; Lacy thought she was supposed to fill in the blank.</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"And he says something funny is going on up there between you and that writer. Get the picture." Again, David laughed at his own joke. "No, I guess you haven't seen it yet."</p>
		<p>Well aware of what David was eluding to now, Lacy cut straight to the chase. "Let's get to it, David. Why did you call and just what's on your evil mind?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, now that was nasty." David feeling a surge of courage continued. "Listen, babe, if you want I'll toss the divorce papers in the trash and take ya back. But things are gonna to have to be my way."</p>
		<p>"And since when has that changed?"</p>
		<p>"Since you quit the show for one. You act like your career doesn't mean a thing anymore. We were ridin' high with that one and kaput..." He snapped his fingers. "Just like that you end it." </p>
		<p>"I will not go back to..... blindly taking your advice about my career and how to act and how much time I should have with my children." </p>
		<p>"Our children." He corrected her. "And if you still want the divorce then I get custody of the kids."</p>
		<p>"I want the divorce?" Lacy was livid. "You had the papers drawn up. It came as a total surprise to me, but, you know what, David, I do want a divorce. And, no, the kids stay with me."</p>
		<p>"You don't really want me to bring up the sorted affair you're carrying on with that writer, do you? No, it will be my way or you'll take a quick detour off a highway to nowhere. Nobody in Hollywood will hire you. Got it?"</p>
		<p>Sucking in a deep breath, Lacy willed herself to remain calm. "David, you didn't even want Derek, remember?"</p>
		<p>"Fine. I'll just take Dani." His voice dropping to a mumble. "Who knows if the kid is really mine anyway." </p>
		<p>"You son of a bitch. You would separate them, wouldn't you? And I'm sorry to say this, but Derek is yours. I don't know why you keep suggesting differently." Lacy yelled. Pulling herself in check as not to wake the kids, she regained her composure. "I'm calling my lawyer as soon as I get off the phone. You want a battle you'll get one. I'm sure having you're little girlfriend won't bode well for you." </p>
		<p>"Huh. Having a mistress is done everyday here. But, when you pull your lover out of the closet so to speak....." David couldn't help it, he laughed again.
			<i>I am just too funny. </i>"That career of yours that I had flying high is gonna fall so fast you won't know what hit you. Then you'll be begging for me to take you back." David slapped the telephone down before she could reply.
		</p>
		<p>The rest of the day was spent in relative silence. Lacy refused to talk about what soured her mood and her children were recovering from the traumatic events of the day before. Dani was particularly leery of mentioning the cave, not wanting to get in trouble from her mother.</p>
		<p>Lacy tried several times to reach her agent to find out why he would have called David, informing her soon to be ex husband about the anonymous call. She left several messages.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>After a long day of silence and having tucked the kids safely into bed for the night, Lacy revealed the contents of her call from David to Gage. Helpless to find out she was the source of Lacy's problems, Gage prayed the Calvary would arrive and it did in the form of a phone call.</p>
		<p>"Mark, hi." Gage breathed a sigh of relief. "Do you have anything for me?"</p>
		<p>"I do." Her ever-faithful friend informed her.</p>
		<p>Lacy watched from across the room as Gage spent the next twenty minutes talking with Mark Calico, her business partner. The few spurts of laughter and sincere thanks Gage offered her friend did not sit well with the actress. Even though Lacy was concerned about the potentially dangerous relationship blooming between them and how it would affect her life, her career and especially her children's lives, she couldn't help, but feel a persistent surge of jealousy ripped through her body at how easily Gage conversed with Mark. </p>
		<p>When Gage finally hung up, she turned to Lacy offering a big smile. "Great news." </p>
		<p>The expression on Lacy's face was nothing short of lackadaisical. </p>
		<p>"Okay, I'll let you be the judge of that." Gage stated. "My friend, Mark...." She read a definite frown on Lacy's face at the mention of her producing partner. "Let me back up. I called Mark a few days ago after David showed up with the divorce papers and asked him to check out a few things. Seems Ron Griffen was Mark's roommate at college."</p>
		<p>This bit of news piqued Lacy's interest somewhat.</p>
		<p>"He talked with Griffen and found out some interesting things. Like the word around the studio is that Hayston Rawlings is pregnant." Gage waited for this news to sink in.</p>
		<p>"Go on." It didn't seem to faze Lacy.</p>
		<p>"Okay. And the reason your character was killed off after you decided to quit the show was to make way for a spin off.....after they do a TV movie of it."</p>
		<p>"He actually told Mark that?" Lacy quizzed. "David and Griffen have always been tight."</p>
		<p>"Griffen was only too glad to let his old college buddy in on this because, apparently, after David and Griffen made that deal to produce the spin off starring Hayston, David got greedy pitching it around to another studio, figuring he could get more money and have greater control over it. Needless to say...."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Griffen was pissed." Lacy finished. </p>
		<p>"Exactly. There's something else that has to do with David's partner...."</p>
		<p>"Ryan White." Lacy supplied, crossing her legs.</p>
		<p>"Some deal they had to make a movie together and David tried to circumvent their plans. Instead of making the movie for Griffen Studios...."</p>
		<p>"That must be my movie with Koda Kannon." Lacy interjected. </p>
		<p>"Well, David planned to sweeten the deal with this other studio in hopes of them carrying the spin off of your show starring..."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I know Hayston Rawlings. A pregnant, by my husband, Hayston Rawlings." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<i>
			<p>Oh, I think I see her fangs now.</p>
		</i>
		<p>Reading the expression on Gage's face, Lacy corrected her. "I'm not upset that he got her pregnant, or that they're together, not in the least. Here he tried to browbeat me bringing up our relationship in order to get his way and he has a few dirty little details lurking around him of his own." Lacy said as she let her fuming ramblings spill out unchecked.</p>
		<p>Astonished, Gage forced the next words out. "You think what we have is... dirty?" </p>
		<p>Stunned by the insensitivity of her words, Lacy rushed to Gage, kneeling at her feet. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. It's not the way I feel at all." Sorrowful blue eyes gazed into hurt green ones. "I didn't mean to compare his relationship to ours. I don't know what I was thinking." Lacy's pleading blue eyes begged Gage for absolution. "It was insensitive, but, what I said was not... unforgivable?" </p>
		<p>In that moment, Lacy proffered an opportunity for Gage to rise above her own hurt feelings.
			<i>I would forgive you anything.</i> Stunned by this prevailing and very true thought that resonated deep in her soul, Gage vocalized her resolve. "I would forgive you anything."
		</p>
		<p>Lacy leaned forward capturing exonerating lips sending all the love she felt for this woman who so easily traipsed past her tactless remarks offering nothing but love.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-One">
		<p>Lacy chased Gage into the bedroom, throwing both her arms around Gage's neck as their lips met passionately. The force of the embrace sent them onto the bed, wrapped in each other's arms. </p>
		<p>"I've got you now." Lacy husked.</p>
		<p>Gage smiled.
			<i>You had me the first moment I saw you.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Smothering each other with kisses, lips moved in harmony savoring the sweet taste being offered. Melting in the intensity of their kisses fueled the jolts of pleasure that shot through Lacy's body, now on fire. With a light feathery brush of the star's lips, the writer's demanding tongue asked and received entrance to explore at will.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy tugged at Gage's unwelcome shirt, invading fingers deftly manipulating the buttons, opening the offending shirt for her own exploration. The star's hands caressed the supple skin below it memorizing this new territory in which she was staking claim. The writer's breast ached in pleasure allowing a deep sigh to escape her lips as Lacy's fingers slid over the firm yet soft mound.</p>
		<p>Temporarily unnerved by Lacy's roaming hands, Gage continued her own assault on the willing women above her letting her hungry lips migrate down Lacy's sexy neck, leaving a trail of soft, tantalizing and, oh, so provocative kisses. </p>
		<p>Yanking the star's top then pulling it over her head, Gage's eyes immediately zeroed in on the beautiful breast dangling above her. As Gage took possession of a mouthful of the delicious nipple before her, the star moaned at the contact, distracting her own journey further. Suckling the breast caused Lacy to push forward while pulling the writer even closer. Gage's lips took advantage of this contact twirling her tongue around the firm nipple, sucking, kissing..... worshiping it.</p>
		<p>Running her hands through the writer's short blonde hair, Lacy gasped when Gage nipped ever so lightly planting slow, teasing kisses as she moved to give the other neglected breast the same attention. The pleasing tongue snaked out and playfully flicked the corral colored nipple. Her tongue continued to trace a lazy path over Lacy's beautiful breast, reveling in the riot of sensations permeating both lovers.</p>
		<p>The writer flipped the star over catching Lacy's piercing blue eyes for a brief moment. With a sultry, predatory smile, Gage nibbled her way over the star's soft, flat stomach pausing to languidly circle Lacy's navel with her tongue. </p>
		<p>The writer's eager hands traveled along the curve of the star's hips down her leg, pushing her jeans down as her fingers grazed over the supple skin. Lacy felt a liquid rush of fire between her legs as Gage's fingertips danced up her inner thigh. Having rid the stunning woman of her clothes, the writer engaged in a full frontal attack. The blonde glided up the star's tingling body, returning her hungry lips to take possession of Lacy's mouth. </p>
		<p>Breathlessly, Lacy pulled back to catch her breath. "I love you." </p>
		<p>As Lacy reached up to claim the mouth she relished kissing, Gage stopped her, meeting a disappointed frown. "Lacy, you remember when you asked me what you were wearing the day I first met you?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." Lacy reached again to take possession of those enticing lips a mere breath away. Frustrating the star one more time, Gage continued. "There's something I didn't tell you."</p>
		<p>This statement got Lacy's full attention. "What?" Almost afraid to ask. </p>
		<p>"I remember having this notion crash over me, filling the depth of my soul." Sincere green eyes pinned blue.</p>
		<p>Lacy arched a perfect sculptured eyebrow in question.</p>
		<p>Simply stated, Gage revealed. "There stands before me the woman I love." Between soft, tantalizing kisses, Gage declared in a whisper over and over again. "I love you, Lacy, so very much."</p>
		<p>Losing herself in the love and passion she felt, captivating every sensation, Gage luxuriated in the feelings that ran rampant through her being. Capturing the inviting lips of the dark haired woman again, roaming hands had their way bringing Lacy on the verge of unimaginable heights. </p>
		<p>"I'm gonna love you till you scream out my name in passion." Gage declared, capturing her lover's lips again, tongues dueling in a heated exchange.</p>
		<p>Breaking from an intense kiss, heaving, Lacy countered. "And you're so sure I'll do that, huh?" </p>
		<p>With a wicked grin, Gage's tone held a promise. "Well, you will if I do it right." With that coaxing hands slithered across Lacy's body while pleasing lips did their part driving the woman in her arms into a sensual vortex to a never before reached precipice, making good on that the pledge. </p>
		<p>The last conscious thought prevailing in the star's mind left no doubt that the promise offered had been delivered.
			<i>Oh, you did it right, sweetheart, so very right. </i>A satisfied smile framed the star's beautiful face all night long, wrapped tightly in the possessive arms of her lover.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Morning found Lacy draped over the writer, happy and content. Lazing against the warm body next to her, Lacy climbed over Gage, settling her lower body between the writer's legs.</p>
		<p>Soft lips brushed against still sleeping ones. Gage smiled at the intoxicating contact. "Hmmmm. Do I get to wake up like this every morning?" Sleepy eyes opened, gazing at the gorgeous woman who took up residence on top of her.</p>
		<p>Serious blue eyes stared into suddenly concerned green. "You are going to marry me." It was more of a command than a question.</p>
		<p>Completely taken aback by the insistent request, Gage allowed only a millisecond to recover before responding. "Anytime, anywhere, anyway."</p>
		<p>"Good." Lacy sealed the vow with a kiss before either one had time to think about the near impossible quest. </p>
		<p>Both refused to allow uncertain invading thoughts such as:
			<i>She's not even divorced yet. Is there a place where two women can actually get married or will we just have a commitment ceremony? What will my parents think? How will her kids react? What about my career? What about her career?</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Lacy?" Gage gathered the woman on top of her closer; planting a soft kiss on her head allowing only one disrupting thought to intervene. "Are you sure?"</p>
		<p>The dark head popped up. "Sure about what? Us?"</p>
		<p>"No, not exactly. Me." Gage swallowed. "You deserve the very best."</p>
		<p>"I have the very best." Dipping her head, capturing Gage's lips in a passionate, reassuring kiss.</p>
		<p>When the soft wet lips she craved pulled back slightly, Gage vowed. "Whatever happens, I will always love you no matter what. And, I'll be there...through your divorce, custody of the kids. Everything. I promise."</p>
		<p>Laying her head on Gage's chest, Lacy closed her eyes and whispered. "I know."
			<i>And I know things won't be easy. </i>Lacy rose up staring into lover's eyes intently.
			<i>I will always love you, too, no matter what.....I promise. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Her blue eyes told Gage what she didn't say out loud. "I know." Gently laying Lacy's head back to her chest, Gage sucked in a deep breath knowing their lives had been irrevocably changed the moment they met that day on the beach. Destiny had rode up and carted them away, forever entangling their lives and the soul they shared. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Two">
		<p>After dragging herself out of bed, Lacy made an early morning call to David's partner, Ryan White, asking him to confirm the information Mark Calico supplied Gage the previous day. </p>
		<p>When Lacy noted a raised eyebrow from Gage, she explained. "It's not that I don't believe Mark. I need to be sure of the facts before I go accusing David of anything. I can't take chances where my kids are concerned."</p>
		<p>Cocking her head sideways and displaying a lopsided smile, Gage took her lover into a warm embrace. "Then we won't."</p>
		<p>"I want to hang around here in case he calls back today." Lacy said, returning the hug fiercely. "Thank you." </p>
		<p>Totally lost in the moment, sharing tender kisses, they didn't notice a mischievous three-year-old sneak up on them until he tugged at his mother's leg. "Momma." Derek reached up. "Want hug, too."</p>
		<p>Lacy dipped down, retrieving her son, sandwiching him between the two lovers. "That better?"</p>
		<p>"Unn hunnn." Wiggling between them, securing his place amongst two of the three most important people in his young life, Derek giggled when he saw the perplexing look his sister wore as he peeked over his mother's shoulder. "Dani." He pointed then quickly hid his head, burying it between his mother and Gage.</p>
		<p>With her back to her daughter, Lacy chilled to the bone, allowed every imaginable thought run through her mind of what Dani must be thinking. Lacy slowly turned around to face an expected accusation, meeting an annoyed expression instead. </p>
		<p>"Derek!" Dani cocked her hands on her hips. She pointed back at her brother. "That is my whistle." She sauntered up to her mother and Gage. Reaching up she reclaimed it. "Thanks for trying to get it from him." Dani walked off ignorant of the shared lover's embrace. "We going swimming today?"</p>
		<p>The breath she held escaped slowing, relieving the mounting tension Lacy had felt rise. "No. I'm expecting a call."</p>
		<p>As if on cue the telephone rang, Lacy bolted for it. "Hello." A pregnant pause. "Oh, hi, mom." She sat down on the edge of the couch. "No, I was expecting someone else. What's up?"</p>
		<p>"You still coming to visit us after you're vacation?" Lynn asked avoiding what was really on her mind.</p>
		<p>Lacy threw a quick look to Gage before she answered. "Yes. Yes, we will."</p>
		<p>Hesitant, Lynn continued. "I take it that David won't be coming along."</p>
		<p>Silence reigned between them as Lacy processed the implication of her mother's words. "David called you, didn't he?" Connecting with concerned green eyes, Lacy gave Gage the only cue she needed. Gage gathered the kids up, herding them out the door on their way to the boathouse.</p>
		<p>"Yes." </p>
		<p>This simple reply left no doubt about what her mother was thinking. "What did he tell you? No, I have a fair idea." Summoning her courage,
			<i>This isn't the way I wanted my parents to find out. </i> Lacy said. "He told you about the divorce, I take it."
		</p>
		<p>"To be honest, honey, I'm more concerned about....." Lynn started to say.</p>
		<p>"You don't sound surprised about the divorce." Delaying the inevitable discussion between mother and daughter regarding Gage.</p>
		<p>"Not really. I've seen it coming for a long time." Lynn decided not to beat around the bush. "What I didn't see coming was David's claim...." She emphasized that last word, not really believing it. "That you were cheating on him."</p>
		<p>"What!" Lacy was livid, jumping off the couch only to pace around the room. "He cheated on me."</p>
		<p>"With your co-star?" Lynn asked.</p>
		<p>"Did you see that too?" The question held a biting sarcastic edge. </p>
		<p>"Lacy Francine. I am still your mother." Lynn admonished her actor daughter. </p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. My emotions have been on a roller coaster ride this last week." Lacy admitted. </p>
		<p>"I'm sure they have. Now, tell me about this friend of yours." Her voice offered no judgment.</p>
		<p>"Her name is Gage. She's a writer and she saved both of your grandchildren's lives." Lacy offered hopefully in a symbolic gesture to put Gage's best foot forward before she realized the impact her words had.</p>
		<p>Drawing in a deep breath, Lynn asked quietly. "They're okay?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. Absolutely perfect. Really." </p>
		<p>"Then we'll put that aside for now, but I will want every detail nothing left out. Understand? Now tell me about Gage." </p>
		<p>Mother and daughter talked for the next hour. Lacy relating the highs and lows their vacation served up only leaving out the most intimate details of her relationship with the writer. Although her astute mother ploughed through Lacy's evasive explanation, zeroing in on the concealed information her daughter refused to supply. </p>
		<p>"Lacy, I just want you to know you can tell me anything. I am your mother and I love you. Your father and I both do.... no matter what."</p>
		<p>
			<i>No matter what? I'm gonna hold you to that mom. </i>"I know and I love you too." Lacy suggested a compromise. "How bout we talk when we come to visit?"
		</p>
		<p>"Will I meet Gage?" Like a bulldog reluctant to let go of the bone, Lynn held firm.</p>
		<p>"Yes." With that the conversation ended.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Early afternoon brought the call Lacy was expecting. "Ryan, thank you." She hung up the telephone. All her suspicions confirmed. Walking outside, she met up with the happy trio fishing from the dock. Lacy took a seat next to Gage. </p>
		<p>"Mom, look." Dani shoved the cooler full of fish at her mother. "Guess what's for dinner."</p>
		<p>Unexpectedly, Lacy pulled her daughter into a hug, squeezing her tightly, which practically knocked the cooler from the young girl's hands.</p>
		<p>"Hey." Dani complained.</p>
		<p>"Sorry." She watched Dani move back to her original fishing position on the edge of the dock. </p>
		<p>Covertly, the expert fishermen watched her mother's sad expression turn even gloomier.
			<i>I bet it's because of dad. Why does he have to work all the time? And I won't even think about the broken promises. </i>Determined to bring a smile back to her mother's face, Dani vowed to be the very best daughter she could. Suddenly, she rose, walked over to her mother and kissed her. "I love you."
		</p>
		<p>Welcoming the unexpected gesture, Lacy kissed her daughter's cheek. "What's this all about?"</p>
		<p>Having watched Dani, Derek wanted in on the action. He almost missed the early morning hug between his mother and Gage and would not be left out of this either. Derek carelessly tossed his fishing pole in the water, climbing up on his mother's lap; he gave her a sloppy wet kiss.</p>
		<p>Astonished by her brother actions, Dani yelled out, pointing to the murky water below. "The pole. Get the pole!"</p>
		<p>If Gage would have taken the time to think, she would have realized &#145;
			<i>it's just a fishing pole and we can get others' </i>but, no, spurred on by Dani's hysterical screaming, Gage dove in.
		</p>
		<p>A short while later Gage surfaced to find three concerned faces looming over the dock's edge. Holding up the pole, the writer lifted herself up out of the water. Soaked, she sat on the dock, handing the discarded pole to Dani. </p>
		<p>Taking it, she perused it carefully. "Oh, this is his old one. It was kinda broke." Giving it back to Gage, Dani casually said over her shoulder. "Thanks anyway."</p>
		<p>A frustrated glance found its way from daughter to mother then to a happy three year old who decided Gage needed a kiss, too. The fact that it was a sloppy wet one just like the one he gave his mother didn't have as much impact on the writer as trickles of water fell from her hair, sliding down her face. "You're welcome."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>A warm shower later along with dry clothes altered Gage's mood considerable. As the kids watched some videos Lacy had brought with them, the star recounted to Gage her earlier conversation with Ryan White.</p>
		<p>"It's all true. Ryan was a bit shocked that David went behind his back. My next movie is with Griffen Studios."</p>
		<p>"And that Casanova chap Koda Kannon."
			<i>I won't be jealous. I won't be jealous.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy covered the writer's hand, squeezing it. As the kids were enthralled in the Derek's favorite cartoon, Lacy took the opportunity to steal a quick kiss from her lover. "Griffen is financing it. And David and Ryan are....were the producers. Ryan was also scheduled to direct it."</p>
		<p>"And now?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know what's going to happen now. Anyway, when David killed off my character he secretly planned with Griffen to do a TV movie of the show then do a spin off. They didn't want to just let it go since it was such a big success. Griffen tied me into doing a movie to make up for quitting. Now, as Mark found out and Ryan confirms, David went to MegaCom behind everyone's back in an effort to get more control of the show's spin off, sweetening the deal with the movie Koda and I are scheduled to do."</p>
		<p>"How can he wheel and deal like that? Who holds the rights to the show anyway?" The business end of show business was foreign to Gage.</p>
		<p>"David was setting it up. Then MegaCom would have initiated the deal with Griffen, buying out the rights to the show and David would have pulled out from Griffen Studios on my next movie tossing it to MegaCom. You see, Hayston hadn't signed on for the spin off yet. With David controlling her, he potentially had Griffen over the barrel."</p>
		<p>"And Ryan was left out of the loop?"</p>
		<p>"Ryan would never have gone along with it." Lacy stated with absolute assuredness. "He's very loyal. Where it leaves the two of them now, David and Ryan, who knows? I suspect Ryan will insist David holds to their original deal with Griffen about the movie and sort out the rest later. Though, hopefully, David will take a back seat in making it."</p>
		<p>"Ryan sounds like a great guy." Gage said.</p>
		<p>"He is. As a matter of fact, he found out from David that Sally called him about us......kissing. Ned, Ralph or Buddy must have saw us and told Sally."</p>
		<p>"Jage..... it's Jage." Derek yelled, pointing to the TV screen. </p>
		<p>Rushing into the living room, Lacy and Gage watched Derek bounce on the floor, happily pointing to the cartoon character that looked amazingly like Gage.</p>
		<p>"That's it." Dani jumped up. "That's why he threw himself at you. Yes." Dani jacked her arm in victory. </p>
		<p>"Dani, what do you mean?" Lacy inquired of her overexcited daughter.</p>
		<p>"You see, I couldn't figure out why Derek liked her so much." Shifting a quick glimpse to the writer. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>Waving a dismissive hand. "No problem." </p>
		<p>Dani continued. "Derek thinks he's Devlin. There." The eight year old pointed to the cartoon's main character. </p>
		<p>"Debin. Debin, Debin." Derek chanted.</p>
		<p>When the character that looked like Gage reappeared, Dani explained further. "This character, Gentry, is Devlin's hero. Kinda a protector." </p>
		<p>"Genty. Jage." Derek said, pushing up from his seat on the floor then grabbing Gage's hand, pulling her closer to the TV set.</p>
		<p>Rubbing her chin in deep thought, Dani remembered. "There was a show once where Devlin had to jump off this cliff and Gentry caught him. That's it. That's why he jumped to her. Case closed." She concluded.</p>
		<p>The mystery finally solved, the four sat down on the floor as Derek climbed on the lap of his favorite hero content to watch Gage's hero counterpart on TV.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Three">
		<p>Backed into a corner, David Levine called his wife of ten years in order to make a deal that wouldn't leave him out in the cold. After his partner, Ryan White and boss, Ron Griffen was through with him, David was ready to concede to just about anything. Though he swore he wouldn't come off as a total weakling in front of his wife or Hayston, for that matter.</p>
		<p>"So, it's this way, Lacy. We both get custody of the kids." David insisted.</p>
		<p>"I get full custody, David. There is no debate about this. Griffen knows I'll back out of the movie deal and where would that leave you." Lacy used this leverage granted her by the head of Griffen Studios. Ron Griffen felt bad about pressing Lacy into making the movie exploiting her already guilty feelings about quitting. He led her to believe he'd lose tons of revenue. Although, Griffen and David had already hatched a plan for a spin off so they wouldn't be hurting for anything. And, Griffen wanted to get at David for going behind his back with MegaCom. The movie mogul didn't want to lose the talented thirty five year old producer; he just wanted to make David squirm.</p>
		<p>And squirm he did. "Fine. But I get to see them when I want."</p>
		<p>"I don't intend to keep them away from you, David. I want what's best for our children."</p>
		<p>Lightening his harsh tone, David charmingly suggested. "I don't guess there's any chance we could get back together." </p>
		<p>Nauseated, Lacy countered. "Why don't you ask Hayston? She may have something to say about it."</p>
		<p>"She has nothing to say about it." David smirked, but it swiftly turned into a weak and dismal grin that reached his pale gray eyes when Hayston walked up behind him, having heard the last part of their conversation, effectively ending his discussion with Lacy.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"What's a matter?" Gage asked, grabbing hold of Lacy, steadying her as she stood over the toilet.</p>
		<p>"Nothing." The star's pale features told another story. "Just a little sick to my stomach."</p>
		<p>Settling Lacy down on their bed, Gage felt the star's head to see if she had a fever, brushing the stars dark bangs aside. "No wonder with everything you've gone through in the last few days. I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>"Where are you going?" Said weakly.</p>
		<p>"To get you some crackers....I wonder if we have some seven-up." Gage said more to herself as she left the room.</p>
		<p>Lacy slid down on the bed, turning on her side. </p>
		<p>Returning quickly, Gage pulled the dark haired woman up. "Here." She handed Lacy the crackers and offered her a sip of the uncola. "How long have you felt like this?"</p>
		<p>Taking only a couple of sips and nibbling on a cracker, Lacy laid back down. "It hurts." She grabbed her stomach. "It's probably just cramps."</p>
		<p>"Okay." Gage bolted out of the room, returning in a flash. "Here are some pain killers....take two." She gave them to Lacy who obediently did, washing them down with the soda. "I think there's a heating pad somewhere." Gage entered the adjoining bathroom, rifling through the closet. "I got it."</p>
		<p>She plugged it up, handing it carefully to Lacy, securing it in place. Then curled up behind the star, covering them then wrapped comforting arms around the woman she loved. Nestling even closer, Gage whispered. "I love you." Then brushed healing lips softly against Lacy's smiling mouth. </p>
		<p>Dani followed the worried writer after she had made two frantic trips to the kitchen and back to the bedroom. From the doorway, the engaging scene played out before the young girl's blue eyes. Dani saw the love and tenderness Gage showed her mother. </p>
		<p>Dani backed away from the door leaving the two women alone. Plopping down on the couch, she heard Derek laugh at his favorite cartoon character. Pondering the scene she'd just witnessed, Dani collected from her memory all the evidence she had accumulated over the last couple of weeks regarding the subtle yet intimate interactions between her mother and Gage, leading the almost nine year old to one conclusion. This revelation reminded her of her earlier vow to be the very best daughter she could be for her mother. It made her smile, but also left many questions unanswered. </p>
		<p>That evening Dani readied her brother for bed then made a side trip to the master bedroom announcing that they were going to sleep and hoped her mother felt better. Dani didn't raise an eyebrow upon seeing her mother positioned against the writer snugly, which did not go unnoticed by either of them.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The next day Lacy was feeling better. Though Dani diligently watched her recovering mother so she went along with plans to go to town and restock up on their supplies for the remaining two weeks of vacation without complaint.</p>
		<p>That evening the foursome discussed plans for the rest of their vacation when Dani asked. "When's daddy coming back?" </p>
		<p>Breathing deeply, Lacy decided it was time to have that talk with her daughter. "Dani, come here." The thirty-year-old mother requested her daughter.</p>
		<p>Dani sat down beside her mother on the couch when Gage picked up the young boy. "Why don't I give you a bath, young man?" Gage offered, knowing green eyes sent a silent message to Lacy allowing her to have some privacy with her daughter. Tucked under the writer's arm, Gage slipped quietly down the hall with the squealing child.</p>
		<p>Shifting her daughter closer, Lacy began the long, laborious journey of explaining to an eight year old that her parents are separating. "Dani, you know, I love you? Both you and Derek."</p>
		<p>Shaking her head adamantly, Dani agreed.</p>
		<p>"And that will never change no matter what." She assured the young girl. "Though sometimes in adult relationships, people grow apart and that love.... changes."</p>
		<p>The astute eight-year-old knew where this road was heading. "You and daddy."</p>
		<p>Not surprised that her intelligent daughter surmised this conclusion, Lacy continued. "Yes. So your daddy... we're filing for divorce. But, like I said, that doesn't mean we don't love you both. Or that we will ever stop.....a parent's love for their child is forever. I love you, Dani."</p>
		<p>"I love you, too, mom." The usually expressive blue eyes turned dark.</p>
		<p>Pulling the dark haired girl closer, Lacy prayed whatever happened in the future she would do right by her kids. The children of divorced parents had a way of coming under fire between the battling ex-spouses and she vowed this would not happen to them. She also recognized that children sometimes withdrew, holding in their feelings and Lacy engineered a spontaneous plan to not let that happen. "As long as we talk about everything, things will be alright. I promise you. Can we promise to each other to do that.... about anything?" Then quickly added. "Do you have any questions?" </p>
		<p>With dark blue eyes, Dani captured ones that matched her own and asked seriously. "Mom, can I still love daddy?"</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Gathering her daughter in her arms. "Of course, you can." Kissing her daughter's dark head, Lacy hugged her tightly. "You can love whomever you want. That doesn't change and no one will ever make you choose between us. Okay?"</p>
		<p>Relieved, Dani shook her head and made a definitive decision. "I think I'll go to bed. If Derek's through with his bath, I'll read to him. He loves that. Do you want me to tell him about you and daddy?"</p>
		<p>"How bout later, he's still a little young." Stopping her daughter's exit. "You know, Derek has the best big sister ever."</p>
		<p>This shoved a bright smile up on her face. "He does, doesn't he?"</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Oh, no, you don't." Lacy scrambled under Gage, trying to get away. Straddling the star, Gage held her captive tightly as she leaned over her. "I've got you now."</p>
		<p>"I could get away if I wanted to." Lacy assured her captor. </p>
		<p>Gage's smile widened. "Really?" Lacy wiggled again to no avail.</p>
		<p>Reaching up, Lacy took possession of the writer's waiting lips. The intoxicating sensations from the star's magnetic lips sent a dizzying Gage beyond conscious awareness. The blonde loosened her hold, falling into the seductive haze the dark haired women wove around her. With each kiss delivered, soft and tantalizing leaving a trail of burning fire everywhere the star's mouth touched. Gage moaned in appreciation.</p>
		<p>Delving deeper into the mind-boggling kiss, Lacy tossed the writer on to her back as she claimed herself conqueror. The younger woman slowly drew back causing Gage's beckoning lips to follow until Lacy left one last languid kiss between them. </p>
		<p>Clambering off the writer, Lacy said in victory. "I told you I could get away." </p>
		<p>Lacy was soon being chased by her eager lover. "Not for long." Gage in hot pursuit of her target jumped around a small chair, catching the leg's edge, hitting the floor hard. Within seconds she was back on her feet, stalking her prey. </p>
		<p>Lacy, cornered between the bed and the bathroom door, waited precisely for the moment Gage lunged at her then jumped on the bed trying to get away. </p>
		<p>But not soon enough before the writer snared one of the Lacy's long legs at the ankle, dropping her on the bed. Hastily climbing back on top the laughing star, Gage reclaimed her position. "Now you're mine."</p>
		<p>The words spoken silenced the pinned dark haired woman. Looking deeply into her lover's eyes, Lacy concurred. "Yes, I am."</p>
		<p>Lips met in an all-consuming passionate kiss, but ended too soon when Gage gently pushed her woman back down. "Stay there." As Gage knelt over Lacy she slowly, sensually removed every article of clothing on the woman below her. Hands pushed up the sides of her white t-shirt and over her head, flipping it behind her. Scooting down the writer released the snap at the top of her jeans then pulled the zipper down.</p>
		<p>Lacy cocked an eyebrow.</p>
		<p>Adroit fingers slipped under the edge of the jeans waistband, grasping the panties below. "Oh, these have got to go." In one quick smooth motion, Gage freed the younger woman from the confines of her pants. Laying back down on Lacy, the writer kissed her lover soundly. "Now that I have you where I want you."</p>
		<p>"You mean completely naked."</p>
		<p>Taking the opportunity to languidly let desire-filled green eyes linger down the sexy body of the star, Gage returned her hungry eyes to lust-filled blue ones. </p>
		<p>Firing her hands into action, Lacy tugged and pulled at Gage's clothes before they were stymied from any further pursuit. </p>
		<p>"Not yet." Gage admonished.</p>
		<p>Lacy's persistent hand tried again and failed being clasped securely by her lover.</p>
		<p>"Stay." Gage commanded allowing her voice to soften when she continued. "Please?"</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Perfectly content to do as she was asked, Lacy basked in the surrounding warmth of love she felt from the blonde hovering over her. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Gage reached up, hesitating briefly to ensure that Lacy remained still then removed the gold mariner-linked necklace from around her neck. In silent question, Gage asked and received permission, placing the necklace around the lovely neck of her lover. "I wanted you to have something of mine."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Touching the necklace, Lacy smiled, placing her hand over Gage's heart. "I already do." Then touching the gold necklace. "But I love this. Thank you."</p>
		<p>Ducking her head to retrieve a quick kiss, Gage whispered. "You know if you wear this people will know....that you really do belong to me." A lopsided smile crossed her face. "Well, at least Mark."</p>
		<p>Offering thankful lips to her lover, Lacy assured her. "I want everyone to know it." In a show of her commitment to Gage, Lacy shed the diamond wedding ring from her finger, placing it on the night table. Returning devoted eyes to her lover briefly before she heard.</p>
		<p>"Momma." Derek called from the doorway.</p>
		<p>Startled, Gage slid to the side protecting the naked mother from the view of her child. </p>
		<p>Lacy popped her head up over her shield. "Honey, what is it?"</p>
		<p>"I got to pee." Holding himself as he nervously pranced about.</p>
		<p>Gage flipped the sheet up over Lacy before she hustled off the bed. Grabbing the young child's hand, Gage led him down the hallway to the bathroom only allowing a quick glance back at her very naked lover wrapped haphazardly in the white cover.</p>
		<p>After a few moments, Gage returned to find Lacy fully clothed again. "Oh, no, you don't." Stealthily, Gage inched forward, waggling her eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"That's the second time you've said that to me tonight." Lacy posed seductively, waiting for her lover on the huge bed. "I didn't know if you'd be coming back alone."</p>
		<p>"I never want to come alone." Green eyes flashed over the wicked grin she proudly wore then Gage lunged for the bed. "He's all tucked in." Nuzzling Lacy's neck, the writer murmured. "Shall we continue?" Teeth gently nipped at the soft skin on Lacy's throat.</p>
		<p>"Do we dare?" Lacy yelped as Gage did an excellent impression of Count Dracula.</p>
		<p>Scaling back on top of Lacy, she unintentionally tickled the star. Lacy squealed out in boisterous laughter. The blonde slide her hands along the same t-shirt she removed earlier intent on doing it again until two happy kids rushed into the room making a beeline for the bed.</p>
		<p>"A tickle fight." Dani yelled before she jumped on the bed.</p>
		<p>Derek pulled at the covers. "Me too. Me too." He complained before Gage pulled him up to join the spontaneous festivities. </p>
		<p>The four wrestled on the big bed laughing, wiggling and engaging in what would become a regular family event. As Gage skillfully found Lacy's bare ribs, she tickled her mercilessly. Dani and Derek enlisted in on the assault against their mother.</p>
		<p>Recalling the tickle fest Lacy told Gage about the morning of their big boat ride, it reminded the writer when she asked Lacy if she was ticklish and the star replied.
			<i>Only a lucky few get to know that. </i>Gage grinned, delighting in a thought of her own.
			<i>I guess I did get that lucky. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"I give. I give." Lacy surrendered to the trio.</p>
		<p>Gage and Dani relented, falling to either side of Lacy. Derek refused to budge from his place on top of his mother. Gazing on the star's perfect profile, Gage could see Dani on the other side of her mother intently staring at the gold necklace around the dark haired woman's neck. </p>
		<p>A sideways glance from Gage told Lacy something was wrong and that's when she felt the scrutiny of her daughter's stare send a shiver through her. Turning to face the young girl Lacy gritted for an explosive reaction.</p>
		<p>Shifting her blue eyes from the necklace to her mother, Dani watched Derek reach up and tug at the necklace. "Jage." He pulled, wanting to return it to his hero.</p>
		<p>Dani observed the apprehension on her mother's face. So, in a show of conviction to be the very best daughter ever, Dani leaned in close and whispered. "I saw her kiss you, mom. When you were sick." A pause. "I think she loves you." Dani concluded without a hint of consternation. The young girl, who was on the verge of being a very mature nine year old, reached forward gathering all of them together, stretching her arms beyond their normal reach. </p>

	<chapter title="Epilogue: Four weeks later">
		<p>Settled in temporarily at Gage's home, Lacy and the kids were preparing for their return to Hollywood the next week for the start of the star's movie.</p>
		<p>Lounging back on the bed, Gage waited for her lover to finish tucking in the kids. With her hands propped up behind her blonde head, Gage wiggled her eyebrows seductively when Lacy entered.</p>
		<p>Lacy bypassed her eagerly waiting lover heading to the dresser then sorted through one of the drawers. She shoved it back then rifled through another one. That search didn't yield what she was looking for so she pushed around the clothes Gage haphazardly slung over a chair.</p>
		<p>"Lost something?" Gage inquired.</p>
		<p>"No." Dropping several pieces of clothes after each inspection. Frustrated, Lacy's shoulders drooped. "It's more like something I missed."</p>
		<p>"Can I help you find it?" Keenly eager to get on with the nightly activities, Gage started to rise. </p>
		<p>"No. You're not going to find it." Lacy offered vaguely, still sorting through some clothes. Then yanked a red nightgown from the behind the chair where Gage had flung it last night. Lacy quickly shed her clothes and slipped on the scantily clad nightgown, which barely reached the top of her thighs, showcasing her long, sexy legs.</p>
		<p>"And you expect that to stay on for long?" Playfully teasing Lacy. When Lacy turned to her lover, Gage easily recognized distressed blue eyes capture her completely. "What's wrong?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing I hope." Lacy unintentionally walked seductively to the bed, lifting her knee up on the side next to Gage, sitting down.</p>
		<p>Gage splayed her hand over Lacy's soft thigh, rubbing it tenderly, allowing her lover all the time she needed. </p>
		<p>"I'm not really missing anything." Lacy sighed. "I'm pregnant."</p>
		<p>Not missing a beat, opening her arms wide, Gage beckoned. "Come here."</p>
		<p>Finding comfort in Gage's arms, a shudder followed the tears Lacy shed.</p>
		<p>"I thought you wanted more kids." Gage reminded the younger woman.</p>
		<p>Moving back, Lacy intently stared into green searching for any hint of displeasure with the news. "I did. I do. But... what.... how do you feel about it?"</p>
		<p>Shrugging, Gage let a slip of jealousy shine through. "I didn't like it one bit, but he was...is, at least for a few more months, your husband. I figured you... you know, the night he arrived at the cabin."</p>
		<p>"I mean about the baby." Lacy corrected her.</p>
		<p>As if drawn like a compass needle to the North Pole Gage's hand made its way to Lacy's firm, flat stomach, resting there. "I love you and Dani and Derek and I already love... your baby."</p>
		<p>Falling on Gage's chest, Lacy let forth a stream of tears. "I love you. You know that?"</p>
		<p>"I know that."</p>
		<p>Deploying her amorous body into action, Lacy maneuvered for a better position. "And now I'm gonna love you." With those words, Lacy seized the writer's lips, moaning at the contact. Lacy's tongue brushed against her lover's mouth slipping past warm lips before her tongue swirled into the inviting cavern. </p>
		<p>The younger woman's hand kept busy, roaming over every inch of the body she'd come so familiar with in the last five weeks. Having taken a reluctant vacation from their nightly lovemaking during the week they visited Lacy's parents, the lovers resumed their bedtime ritual with diligent resolve. </p>
		<p>"Get this off." Lacy jerked the jersey off then hurriedly moved to free her lover of her cotton shorts. The dark haired woman settled between Gage's legs, grinding her hips seductively causing her lover to groan in delight. </p>
		<p>Gage met stroke for stroke, intending on taking control of the situation. Staking claim to her lover's lips, Gage sent Lacy spiraling, out of control. Falling into the vortex of the powerful sensations from the kiss, Lacy lost all conscious thought of anything, but the sweet, seductive contact she savored on her own lips only feeling the licking, sucking wet touch that sent shivers through her oversensitive body. Gage's unrelenting hands were doing their part in distracting the star as they glazed over the soft curve of Lacy's breast.</p>
		<p>Summoning every resource she could muster, Lacy broke the kiss. Determined, Lacy vowed. "I will have my way with you." </p>
		<p>Intent fully on the target below her, Lacy's hands found their way down the writer's side, savoring the soft yet solid curve of Gage's hips as she left a path of quick kisses down the blonde's neck along her collarbone finally taking root over a waiting breast. </p>
		<p>Sucking the breast into her hungry mouth, Lacy couldn't help, but grin when Gage pushed up against her allowing a loud moan to escape. Gage wrapped her arms tightly around her lover, willing her to stay forever.</p>
		<p>On the verge of meeting heaven on earth, Lacy husked. "I love you, Gage." Lacy's hand slithered along the top of her lover's thigh cresting briefly at the top of the blonde's nexus before venturing to the nether region. Coaxing, teasing fingers delivered to its bounty a crescendo of pleasure, washing over the woman below her. Sending her lover over the edge having taken her to the place where their souls met again, reuniting for the journey that led to forever.</p>
		<p>Slowly coming back from the precipice, with a heavy shudder, tears spilled forth unchecked from rapturous green eyes. The love that Gage desperately longed for came as a crashing wave, filling her completely breaking the emotional dam she'd kept in check all her life. </p>
		<p>"Sweetheart, what's wrong?" Lacy anxiously asked.</p>
		<p>A tremble vibrated through her desire-spent body. "I just.... love you so very much." </p>
		<p>As Gage wept, Lacy lured her lover closer, claiming those luscious lips again. "I love you."</p>
		<p>After a soul melding kiss, Lacy draped her body over her lover. Between her husbands and all the leading men she had kissed, Lacy luxuriated in the fact that Gage was the best kisser that ever crossed her lips. Wrapped in Gage's loving arms, Lacy smiled in contentment. "This is where I want to spend the rest of my life."</p>
