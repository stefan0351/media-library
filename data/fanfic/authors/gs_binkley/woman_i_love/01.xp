	<chapter title="Chapter One">
		<p>Lacy Levine's long legs hurried down the corridor at LAX with her young daughter, Danielle, by her side, both toting their carryon bags. Looking back over his broad shoulder, David Levine, called to his television star wife, "Will you two hurry up." With a sharp jerk, David pulled at his son moving him along faster as he navigated around several other passengers en route to their perspective flights.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Oblivious to his father, Lacy noticed her three year old son's unbalanced wobble. She nudged Danielle ahead, letting go of her hand, "Dani, you go with your dad while I get Derek." Dani happily skipped ahead of her raven-haired mother, allowing Lacy to rescue Derek from her pre-occupied husband then Dani grabbed her father's hand, pulling him forward.</p>
		<p>With loving gray eyes that matched his fathers, Derek smiled shyly at his mother as she scooped him up into her arms. His mother quickly kissed his cheek and readjusted her bag, before dashing off to find the rest of her family. Slightly out of breath, Lacy spotted Dani talking with an older woman seated near a window. With David nowhere in sight, her piercing blue eyes scanned the area quickly falling on her wayward husband in a heated discussion with a flight attendant.</p>
		<p>Lacy walked up to her daughter, sitting her bag down along with her son. Derek quickly anchored himself on to his mother's slender leg then looked at his sister and her new friend. Lacy sat down on a nearby seat, holding on to her son while addressing Dani. "Who's your new friend?"</p>
		<p>Anxious to show off, Dani said, "This is Grace. She's 79 years old and married her high school sweetheart, has three kids and fourteen grandchildren and... nine great-grandchildren." There was a time when Lacy would have been surprised at all the information her daughter seemed to squeeze out of strangers in a short amount of time, but she had come to expect it of her curious and outgoing eight year old. "And, Grace....."</p>
		<p>Grace Davidson interrupted the young girl's dissertation. "Fifteen, remember, I said my youngest just had a little girl." </p>
		<p>Dani spared the older woman a quick challenging glance for correcting her, but that expression held court for only a short moment before blooming into a full fledge smile. "Anyway, her husband's dead now." Crossing her arms, daring the old lady to contradict her.</p>
		<p>Grace smiled sweetly, turning her attention to the young boy holding on to his mother's leg as if his life depended on it. "What's your name, little one?"</p>
		<p>Derek shoved his face deeper against his mother's thigh. Dani tugged at Grace's arm. "Derek. But he won't talk to you. You're a stranger."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"He's a little shy." Lacy inserted, stroking her son's short dark hair. Extending her other hand to Grace, she said, "My name's Lacy Levine."</p>
		<p>The old woman recognized the television star immediately upon seeing her. "I know. I watch your show on TV. I was sorry to hear it's going off the air. There aren't many shows with strong women in them." Grace shifted in her seat as Dani nudged closer to her.</p>
		<p>Before Lacy could respond, her ever-boisterous daughter explained. "Mom needed a vacation." She glanced at her mother making sure she hadn't overstepped her boundaries, catching the approving smile from her mother, Dani then added adamantly, "And we did too."</p>
		<p>Grace remained interested as Lacy took up where her daughter left off. "We're vacationing at a lake where my grandparents used to have a cabin."</p>
		<p>"They're dead now." Dani added as a matter-of-factly.</p>
		<p>"Yes, anyway, it's been ages since I've been there." Lacy smiled at the memories that flooded her mind. "My brothers and I had such a great time there when we were little and I...wanted to share that experience with my kids." Lacy was surprised, having divulged this information to a relative stranger, but then again her daughter had a way of making everyone they encountered familiar almost like family. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Mom has a sister too. She's my aunt... and my godmother." Dani stated proudly causing Grace to smile warmly at the confident young girl in front of her.</p>
		<p>Lacy continued. "Anyway, after six long seasons, it was time to move on and I wanted to spend more time with my children." Lacy's beautiful features turned sad. "I've missed so much these last few years."</p>
		<p>Grace touched Lacy's arm gently in reassurance. "They do grow up fast, don't they? But, now, you and your family can have a great time together on vacation."</p>
		<p>"Not all of our family." Dani's bright blue eyes turned steely. "Dad can't come with us. He's too busy." Dani's initial hurt feelings when her father explained he wouldn't be going with them turned into a rare show of anger. It subsided a bit when he offered her some hope that he would try to meet up with them within the week. </p>
		<p>With determination, David headed for his family and plopped down between Grace and his wife. Facing Lacy, he vented. "You won't believe this. They're running late... some kind of mechanical problem." Glancing at his watch, David rubbed his neck. "I don't have time to sit here and wait."</p>
		<p>Tugging at his sleeve, Dani pulled him around. "Daddy, this is my new friend, Grace."</p>
		<p>Reluctantly, he shifted around slightly, throwing an off-handed greeting. "Hi." Turning back to his wife, he offered. "Listen, babe, I really need to get going. But, before I do, I'll try to light a fire under these guys again so you won't have to wait long."</p>
		<p>"David, we're not in a hurry." Lacy assured her husband.</p>
		<p>"That's not the point. They say the plane will leave at ten then it should leave at ten. There are schedules to keep, you know." David was a man who lived by a schedule his whole life, and it suited his present profession as producer and director to a tee. Keeping on schedule meant staying within budget and gave order to his life.
			<i>If I ran my company the way they run this airline, I'd be out of business, over budget and looking for a new line of work.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Levine." Drawing David from his thoughts, Grace continued. "If there is something wrong with the airplane, I, for one, am willing to wait for as long as it takes."</p>
		<p>"Time is money." David briskly countered.</p>
		<p>"More important than the safety of your family?" The new grandmother pointed out politely.</p>
		<p>Getting David's full attention, he turned around sternly eyeing the old woman who was holding onto his daughter. "Of course not. My family is of the utmost importance." David glared at the old woman before him seizing his daughter from Grace's clutches.</p>
		<p>Aware of her husband's short temper, Lacy interceded before a verbal altercation could take root. "David, we'll be all right here. I know you have a meeting." </p>
		<p>Bolting up, David grabbed his wife urging her away from Grace in order to garnish some privacy. Lacy picked up Derek as David shoved his daughter along with him. He stopped a few feet away, glancing back to the old woman then turned back to his wife. "All right, if you want, I'll go ahead and get to that meeting."</p>
		<p>Lacy moved in closer, staring directly into her husband's gray eyes, she searched for some reassurance. "Remember, you promised to come out next week." </p>
		<p>David gave his wife a quick peck on the lips. "At the latest." He dropped down to his daughter and hugged her. "You be good for your daddy, okay?" Blue eyes turned teary. "Honey....." David began, but Dani shunned her father, turning away so he gently twisted her back around. "Sometimes you don't always get what you want. I'd rather be with you and Derek and your mommy, but first I've got to work. Do you understand that?" His shoulders dropped, exasperated, his voice taking on a harsher edge. "Besides, I'll see you next week."</p>
		<p>Sadly, Dani asked. "Does work always have to come first?"</p>
		<p>With no words to offer his daughter, he hugged her tightly. Dani held on never wanting to let go. The little girl prayed her father would keep his word this time.</p>
		<p>Reluctantly letting go of his daughter, David rose letting his eyes fall on his son, still clinging to his mother. "Never thought I'd have a momma's boy," he grumbled.</p>
		<p>"David!" Lacy said sternly, fire blue eyes flaring.</p>
		<p>David reached for his only son, coaxing him trying to get his attention. "Derek, come here." The three year old determinedly remained in his mother's arms. "Aww, hell, I don't have time for this. Come here!" David raised his voice as he took hold of his son. But, Derek let his stubborn streak shine through in defiance of his father. Frustrated, David's anger blared as his face turned red, which did not go unnoticed by his daughter.</p>
		<p>Retrieving Derek from her producer husband, Lacy shielded her son placing him on her side away from David. "You go on and get to that all important meeting. Your family wouldn't want to make you late." Lacy's sarcastic tone grated against her husband.</p>
		<p>"I don't need this, you know." David warned. The last six years had taken a toll on their relationship and David wasn't happy when Lacy informed him a year ago that she was quitting her television show at the end of the sixth season. David planned to do at least two more seasons of the successful cop show starring his wife and her co-star Hayston Rawlings. </p>
		<p>Yanking on his shirt, Dani successfully drew her father's attention away from her mother. "Dad, are you mad at us?" She didn't want anything standing in the way of her father joining them on vacation next week as he promised.</p>
		<p>A reluctant smile spread across his face. "No, hon. I'm not."</p>
		<p>"Are you mad at Derek? He really likes you. But....." Dani hesitated. "sometimes, you sorta scare him."</p>
		<p>An unconscious smirk ran across his face at his daughter's words.
			<i>Great, I have a son who's a scardy cat. </i>If David had chosen to examine his words, he would have realized that he was
			<u>not</u> concerned that he was the source of his son's fearfulness. His concern riveted on the fact that he felt his son was going to be a wimp of a man when he grew up. This was something that was unacceptable to him as a father. It was times like these that David questioned Derek's parentage.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Drawing David from his selfish musings, Lacy suggested. " David, maybe you should go now."</p>
		<p>Reluctantly, David offered. " I guess I could stay a while longer."</p>
		<p>"No. We'll be fine." She leaned over to kiss him diverting her lips to his cheek instead of the lips he offered. "Just make sure you show up later. I don't want you to disappoint Dani again." She whispered in his ear before moving away and reaching for their young daughter. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Through a strained voice, David explained. "Do I have to clarify this again? The head of the studio, Ron Griffen, remember him? Your boss and mine.....demanded that I stay and make sure post production is complete."</p>
		<p>"And your partner, Ryan White, remember him?" Lacy's words ricocheted back at him matching his sarcastic tone. "Volunteered to take care of everything so you could be with us. We haven't had a family vacation in over six years." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I don't want to argue about this, Lacy."</p>
		<p>Ushering Dani ahead of her, she tossed the shared sentiment over her shoulder at him. "Good. Neither do I."</p>
		<p>As David watched his family walk back to sit next to the old woman, his shoulders slumped in frustration. He couldn't understand why she didn't accept his explanation.
			<i>My God, you'd think she thought I was lying about it. </i>It was then a little voice in his head proffered,
			<i>are you?</i> Turning sharply on his heels, David briskly marched away.
		</p>
		<p>Disappointed with the recent events, Lacy watched her husband negotiate his way through the horde of passengers. She didn't want their goodbyes to be soiled in such a hateful manner. But lately every conversation they had turned sour. Feeling a need to talk to someone familiar, Lacy reached in her purse extracting her cell phone and punched a number. Lacy watched as Dani embarked on another long conversation with Grace while Derek remained tucked securely in her arms fighting sleep as she waited for the telephone to ring. </p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Two">
		<p>With the deadly aerosol can in hand, Gage Ballant rushed back inside the cabin, jumping over the couch toward the ringing telephone only to knock it further away. Scrambling on the floor, Gage grabbed the phone, now out of breath, answered it. "Hello."</p>
		<p>"Are you training for a marathon, being chased or just clumsy, as usual?" Straightening back up, Gage smiled at the familiar voice greeting her.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I am not clumsy." Gage strongly denied the ribbing that was being served.</p>
		<p>"Surely, it can't be the only other thing I'm thinking of because you're up there alone, right?" The voice on the telephone taunted.</p>
		<p>"Very funny." Gage frowned. "And for your information, it's chasing."</p>
		<p>"I wish I was there to see who was doing the chasing... is it you or the same geese that were after you a few weeks ago?" The sound of laughter echoed through the telephone recoiling Gage to remember the unpleasant thought that fleetingly crossed her mind of being chased by a flock of geese. </p>
		<p>Gage jumped up, with the telephone in one hand and a can of wasp killer in the other, determined to take her avenge on the wasps that had decided to take up residence on the front porch. "It's a good thing you're not here. I'm in pursuit of your favorite insect. You know the ones that
			<i>chased</i> you around mercilessly until you were stung, swelling up like a balloon." Gage said letting her lighthearted laugh drift through the telephone.
		</p>
		<p>"Hey, I'm allergic to wasps." The unpleasant memory caused Mark to shift uncomfortably in his leather chair. He picked up an antique pen, tapping it on his equally antique desk. "Remember where I left the EpiPen just in case you end up getting stung. It can be deadly," he added seriously.</p>
		<p>Running her hand nervously through her short blonde hair, Gage was immediately upset with her teasing words to her friend and now partner, Mark Calico. When Mark offered his cabin for Gage to write a new screenplay, they came up together to check the place out. The very first day Mark was stung and would have died if he had not already known he was allergic to wasps and always carried EpiPen with him, also having a spare at the cabin just in case. EpiPen stopped the inflammation that spread throughout his body upon being stung; which started to shut down all his major body functions.</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Mark." Gage apologized then offered. "I don't think I'm allergic though."</p>
		<p>"Have you ever been stung?"</p>
		<p>"I don't remember really. I don't think so." Gage was now more than ever determined to eradicate the vicious little creatures that had caused her friend harm. </p>
		<p>Sensitive to his friend's regret, Mark changed the subject and asked. "How's the story going?"</p>
		<p>With keen green eyes, Gage took careful aim and sent a direct hit, flooding the wasp's nest, saturating it with the deadly spray. The aerosol can had a spray distance of up to twenty feet so Gage was safely tucked just inside the cabin door. "Great, actually, almost finished with it. Needs some editing though and you'll have to read it."</p>
		<p>"If it's anything like the first one, then were in business." the CEO of Calico Corporation, a worldwide network, said as he gazed out his 70
			<sup>th</sup> floor high rise office window to the New York streets below.
		</p>
		<p>"Listen, Mark, are you sure you want to venture into film making. I mean, for me, it's a chance of a lifetime, but you have so many other businesses and things." </p>
		<p>Mark gently cut Gage off. "Those other businesses were handed over to me by my grandfather. I want to do something on my own. That's why I was on that board to judge the screenplay competition. Its always interested me and... I found myself a great writer on top of it."</p>
		<p>"Oh, really, are you seeing another writer behind my back?" Gage pretended to pout. "Because if you are, I'll just call up that same grandfather and have him yank his grandson by the ear. You know, he likes me."</p>
		<p>"He loves you." Mark corrected her, thinking fondly of his grandfather who still lived in England at the ripe old age of 90. "No, you're the only writer for me."</p>
		<p>"You may want to reconsider after reading my screenplay." Gage felt confident it was a good story, but this was, after all, a new style of writing for the three times published author.</p>
		<p>"I doubt that. By the way, your latest murder/mystery book just hit the top ten." Having taken over Gage's writing contract to publish her work, Mark's new company, Shadow Publishing, had its first bestseller.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Pre-occupied by the news of her book's success, Gage lost sight of a renegade wasp making a beeline for her. Before she could secure the door, the little bugger slipped inside the cabin. A trained eye tracked the wasp curling busy circles through the living area. "Great news. But I gotta go. The enemy has infiltrated the encampment and I've got a seek and destroy mission at hand." The author chased after the intruder barely hearing Mark's farewell as she spied the wasp fly into the master bedroom landing on the king size bed. Flipping the telephone on the couch, she declared all out war. "Oh, no, you don't. Not in my bed." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>She slammed the aerosol can on the kitchen counter and reached for her weapon of choice, yanking if from the side of the kitchen cabinet. With fly swatter in hand, she stealthily pursued her adversary. Gage's sharp eyes surveyed the interior upon entering the master bedroom. She scanned the area immediately surrounding the huge bed located in the center of the room. Upon seeing no unidentified flying objects, Gage gracefully moved to the edge of the adjoining bathroom entrance. Peeking around the corner, she searched the room shifting her eyes from the counter to the large jet tub, next to the glass encased shower and finally checking the dressing area with no results. </p>
		<p>As Gage stepped in, a buzzing object jetted by her. Twisting around quickly, she stalked the invader out of the master bedroom into the second bedroom just down the short hallway. The high cabin ceiling gave the wasp plenty of airspace, circling around one of the two twin beds placed on either side of the room. "I've got you now."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Gage leaped up on the twin bed on the right just when the wasp diverted its direction to the other side of the room. Jumping from one bed to the other one, she cocked her arm and swatted at the wasp.
			<i>Damn, almost. </i>
		</p>
		<p>It made its escape past the door, taking a direct route though the open kitchen area, once around the living room then coming to rest on the screen door facing. "Come on you cagey little thing. Hold still just a little bit longer." Arm cocked and ready to strike, the fly swatter came barreling down on a direct path to its target. The lucky insect came within inches of its life before it quickly ducked out a small opening in the screen. When the fly swatter finally landed, it found no one home. </p>
		<p>Gage pushed open the screen door, green eyes following the wasp on its happy flight to freedom. The smart wasp had lived to fight another day. Letting the door slam behind her, the defeated writer plopped down on the couch spying the discarded telephone.
			<i>I don't think I'll tell Mark how this little encounter turned out. It would pleasure him way too much. </i>
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>She zoomed around the first class cabin in her own flight of freedom. Dani loved to fly and was desperately encouraging her little brother to follow suit, but to no avail. The more she tried the more Derek shied deeper into his mother's grasp. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Not having been able to reach her mom as they waited for their airplane, Lacy tried again, successfully this time, connecting with her mother while in flight. Now, she was having a hard time concentrating on her telephone conversation with her mother. "Mom, hold on just a second, will you?" Turning her attention to her excited daughter, she said. "Dani, why don't you come sit down next to me?"</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Oblivious to her mother's gentle command, the self-proclaimed pilot smiled happily as she continued her flight though the aisle as other passengers delighted in the rambunctious antics of the young girl. Her infectious personality and laughter captured the other first class passengers when she made one more pass by her brother. "Vrrrroom. Come on, Derek. Fly like a plane. Fly like a plane." Dani's shoulder length dark hair swayed from side to side while flapping her arms, dipping them back and forth wildly. Finally, forcing a reluctant smile from her brother.</p>
		<p>Firmly, Lacy drew her daughter's undivided attention. "Dani!"</p>
		<p>Shoulders plummeted downward crowned by a crestfallen face as Dani spiraled back to her seat next to her mother. She looked apologetically at her audience when her performance came to an abrupt halt. A young steward, witnessing the show, followed her down the aisle. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Before she was even settled in her seat, Dani turned to her mother. "Can I go get Grace? She's way in the back and I'm sure she doesn't have anyone to talk to."</p>
		<p>Finding it hard to deny her daughter anything, Lacy looked to the steward for help with the proffered question. "Is there any way our friend could come up here with us?"</p>
		<p>Hesitant, the newly hired steward shook his head slightly while thinking. "I don't know, ma'am, if we can allow that. Everyone has their assigned seats and we don't...."</p>
		<p>Dani jumped in before another word was spoken. "We have plenty of seats up here. Look. Right there." Pointing to the seat directly across from her. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Scanning his nametag, Lacy offered. "I could pay the difference, if that's the problem, Tim." A brilliant smile accentuated the added, "Please." And the imploring look from the well-known actress settled the issue.</p>
		<p>Giving in, Tim agreed. "Sure."</p>
		<p>Shooting up from her seat, Dani grabbed the young man's hand and bolted down the aisle in search of her friend. "I have to go with you since I know what she looks like." With a quick glance back to the steward, Dani continued. "She's old and has wrinkles all over her face, but she says it gives her character. I don't really know about that though she is rather funny at times."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy returned to her long forgotten telephone conversation with her mother. "Oh, sorry, mom. I guess you heard."</p>
		<p>"She hasn't changed much, has she? Of course, I could be wrong. What has it been? Now, let's see, almost a whole year since I've seen my grandkids." Lynn Lewis inserted making her point crystal clear.</p>
		<p>"Message received, mom." With assurance, Lacy continued. "After our little vacation, we'll try to stop by for a visit."</p>
		<p>"Try?" Lynn's voice housed disappointment. Ever since her actor daughter hit the big time with her television show, Lynn and her husband, Daniel, had rare sightings of their daughter and her children.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Okay. It's a definite visit then." Lacy hoped David wouldn't object and come up with another one of his thousand reasons to thwart her plans for a little family time.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>With that extracted promise from her daughter, Lynn, perked up. "Dan will be ecstatic to hear that. Now, how's Derek? With all that carrying on I heard over the phone, you don't have to tell me how Dani is doing."</p>
		<p>Brushing warm lips across her son's forehead, Derek smiled at his mother. "Just fine. Glad to have his mommy around full time now."</p>
		<p>"Is that the plan?" Lynn hoped her daughter was sincere. Having raised five kids, three boys and two girls of her own, Lynn knew the importance of a mother's role in their lives. With the good, steady construction job her husband had, Lynn had the luxury of staying at home with her children, something not afforded to many moms these days.</p>
		<p>Lacy watched her daughter return with Grace in hand. As they settled down in their seats, she confirmed her mother's hopes. "Yes. At least, after I get this next movie in. Then I intend to take off a few years. Maybe just do some guest spots or a movie a year."</p>
		<p>"And no more series?" Lynn asked hopefully.</p>
		<p>"Certainly not like this last one. It was too time consuming and exhausting." For six years, five days a week and twelve hours a day, Lacy and her co-star labored to make &#145;
			<i>Crackdown'</i> the number one rated show four years in a row. Even in its last two seasons, it stubbornly remained in the top ten. It was time to call a halt before it destroyed her sanity and worse yet adversely affected the lives of her children. She realized it had already taken a toll on her kids and her marriage. So, Lacy simply refused to re-negotiate her contract. Instead, she did commit to making a movie for the Hollywood mogul, Ron Griffen, with the persistent urging of her producer husband and with the understanding that she had completed her commitment to Griffen Studios. "Anyway, we should have plenty of time for visits in the coming years."
		</p>
		<p>Satisfied with her daughter's answer, Lynn changed the subject. "Honey, why'd you call?"</p>
		<p>"I just wanted to hear a friendly voice." Her mother picked up the desolate feeling in her daughter's sad voice.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Is it David?" Lynn pinpointed the problem.</p>
		<p>With a deep sigh, Lacy admitted. "Yeah, David. He couldn't come with us yet. And, we kinda left it.... bad."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Targeting in on the frequent problems between her daughter and her husband, Lynn recognized Lacy's latest decision to quit the show must have triggered an even greater distance between them. David was obsessed with both their careers especially his and, Lacy, once she had tasted fame realized that not all the flavors associated with it were sweet. "Honey, I suggest you and David have a heart to heart talk about your future. Mostly about what you both want out of a career."</p>
		<p>"We will. Hopefully, next week." Suddenly not wanting to talk about this sore issue, Lacy capped the subject closed. "Anyway...."</p>
		<p>The silence that fell between mother and daughter spoke volumes and Lynn took the hint. "Lacy, if you or the kids need anything, you know who to call. Okay? You know, your dad and I both love you."</p>
		<p>"I do." Warmed by her mother's words, a small smile sparked her ivory features before it descended quickly after she said goodbye.</p>
		<p>While talking gleefully to her old friend, with knowing blue eyes Dani glimpsed the forlorn expression that permeated her mother's face. Ever her mother's savior, Dani spieled out any kind of nonsense that would deliberately take her mother's mind off whatever dreadful thoughts that plagued her. "Mom, did you know that Grace built airplanes while her husband flew them in the big one?"</p>
		<p>Curiously drawn from her dark musings, Lacy asked. "Big one?"</p>
		<p>"World War II." Dani wondered why her mother even had to ask.
			<i>Didn't every one know about the big one?</i>
		</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Three">
		<p>Sally Raye eased her old car down the secluded driveway to Cabin C all the while ignoring her passengers. After pulling to a stop, Sally's dark brown eyes glanced through the rearview mirror at the child in the back seat who had been suspiciously eyeing her during the fifteen-minute drive from town. </p>
		<p>
			Hurrying out of the car as fast as her old rickety body could carry her, Sally made her way to the front door, inserting the key. The landlord wanted to get her new tenants settled then head back in town as fast as she could so she wouldn't miss her regular Wednesday night Bingo game.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>As Lacy extracted Derek from his car seat, Dani slipped out of the back seat, jumped up on the short porch then headed for the front cabin railing that overlooked Lake MyKee. </p>
		<p>Reluctant to help, Sally did pick up two of the lighter bags figuring it wouldn't strain her bad back too much.
			<i>If I don't help, that gray haired old witch, Gladys, will be sure to get my spot at Bingo. At least I got the good sense to dye my hair. </i>Sally smiled at that thought remembering how her handyman's brown eyes had lit up after her first experiment with the hair coloring.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy took the two steps up the porch carrying her son. "Dani, come take care of Derek while I get our bags."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Slowly, Dani tore herself away from the railing all the while keeping a close eye on Sally.
			<i>She's not like Grace at all. </i>
		</p>
		<p>With Derek under the watchful eye of his sister, Lacy started unloading their bags from the back of the station wagon. The slow process agitated the landlord so she retrieved another bag from her car.</p>
		<p>"My son, Ned, was disappointed he missed you. But he should be by in the next day or two to check on things and see if you want to rent a car of your own." She flopped the last bag down on the porch. "He can drive you to town if you do. That will just tickle him pink. He's a big fan of yours."</p>
		<p>Figuring she had supplied enough chitchat and happy to get away from the young girl's scrutiny, Sally hurried off without waiting for Lacy to reply.</p>
		<i>
			<pspace/>
		</i>
		<p>Lacy Levine spared a moment to watch the landlord head down the road. "All right then, let's get the bags inside and then how &#145;bout a quick look around the place?" With those words, Dani jumped into action, picking up one of the heavy bags and tugging Derek inside behind her. Dropping the bag near the sofa, Dani lifted Derek onto it. "Now, stay right there. Okay?" </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>A sense of loss flashed across Derek's face as his sister turned to leave him. Within two steps, the eight year old twisted back around meeting her brother's soft gray pouting eyes. "Jeez." She walked back to him. "I'll be right back. Then we get to go play. Okay?" With a quick hug from his sister, the young boy's expression bloomed brighter. </p>
		<p>Lacy observed her children's interaction happy in the knowledge that they adored each other. Keeping a close eye on Derek, Lacy sat the two bags of grocery's on the counter that she had purchased before leaving town then started to put them away.</p>
		<p>Dani took no time at all in bringing their bags from the porch and piling them next to the sofa. "Okay, mom, ready to go exploring." She helped Derek off the couch and headed for the front door. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Just a minute, Dani." Noticing the sliding door off the living room, she placed the last can of food on the shelf. "Let's go out the back." Opening the sliding door that led to the porch, her kids slipped through quickly. Dani handed Derek off to his mom then bounded down the longer flight of steps onto the grassy area between the cabin and the lake. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Derek refused his mother's inviting arms, insisting on taking the five steps down himself giving Dani plenty of time to greet the water's edge instantly in search of interesting and unusual rocks. The gold mine she found would add handsomely to her already growing collection. Immediately claiming several rocks for her own, both of her hands were full.</p>
		<p>As Lacy caught up to her older child, the brilliant smile blazing on the young girl's face sprung open to her normal personality instead of the quiet demeanor Dani had shown since their arrival in town. "You were awfully quiet on the way here. Anything wrong?" Hoping Dani hadn't been agonizing over her father's absence.</p>
		<p>"No." The look on her mother's face demanded more than the laconic answer she offered, so she added. "I just don't like her. She's not at all like Grace." She continued stockpiling rocks, pulling her shirt out to hold them all. "Wouldn't answer any of my questions." Mumbling to herself.</p>
		<p>Lacy watched Derek waddle along the uneven shoreline in the opposite direction, but directed her comment to Dani. "No, she's not though she seemed nice enough."</p>
		<p>Dani stood back up after retrieving a star shaped rock. "She dyes her hair, you know."</p>
		<p>Turning around to face her daughter, Lacy expressed concern at the remark. "And that makes her?"</p>
		<p>"Highly suspicious. Like she has something to hide." One look at the old woman and Dani had completed her investigation of their landlord. Her deductions about the older woman revealed Sally to be someone with a dark past, probably involved in some kind of criminal activity, definitely something hiding behind those mean eyes. Six years of watching her mother's cop show provided Dani with all the education she reasoned she needed to make her assessment.
			<i>And of course, I got a gut feeling about her and it ain't good. </i>
		</p>
		<p>While proud of her daughter's language skills and intellect at such a young age, Lacy did not like the fact that Dani was making value judgments about others by the way they looked. "I've dyed my hair before. Does that mean I have something to hide too?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." She said to the point.</p>
		<p>An arched eyebrow prompted her daughter to continue. "Yourself." Dani supplied, laughing out loud. "In your show when your character, Samantha, went undercover, remember?" Lacy joined her daughter in laughter as she recalled the red spiked hairstyle she adorned for that scene.
			<i>I should have worn a wig like Ryan suggested. It took days to get back to my natural hair coloring.</i>
		</p>
		<p>In the distance, Derek heard the chuckling sounds of his mother and sister waft through the air as he ploughed up a small embankment. Derek loved the out doors and could play for hours either by himself or with his mom or sister. It was in these alone times that an adventurous nature boldly peeked out from his shy personality. An outgoing personality he stole from, Devlin, the main character on his favorite cartoon show. Devlin was an audacious little guy with a curious and daring attitude cloaked with a bravado that inevitably led him to trouble. Therefore, it was a good thing that Devlin had his very own protector, Gentry. </p>
		<p>Cresting the small hill near the top, which gave way to a sharp drop facing the shoreline, Derek's eagle eyes caught sight of a moving object bouncing along. </p>
		<p>Gage Ballant strolled along the sparsely sandy beach scanning the ground below for rocks while idly thinking about her new screenplay. She became much more discriminate in the rocks she selected for her collection as she became older. The arrival of her fortieth birthday two years ago had sobered her impulsive actions somewhat. If it hadn't, she would have had to rent a warehouse for all the rocks she would have undoubtedly collected through the years.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Suddenly, her concentration from the many stones lying on the ground was jerked away by a soft shuffling noise a top the six-foot high embankment. </p>
		<p>Looking up, green eyes locked with gray that sparked a proverbial connection. Rooted in place, Gage pondered the familiar link between them, then a quick movement from the young child spurred Gage into action.</p>
		<p>From a distance, Lacy scanned the area in search of her wayward son. Tracking him as he moved toward the edge of the embankment, seeing him pick up speed, her heart thundered against her chest sensing the danger that awaited him at the edge of the short knoll. "Derek." She screamed.</p>
		<p>Lacy bolted toward her son, terror reigning in every part of her body as she watched him run then jump over the edge. Dani felt the impending danger her brother was embarking upon and immediately dropped all her rocks. </p>
		<p>With arms straight out to his side, Derek leaped into the wind off the small cliff as he yelled. "Fly plane, fly." The broad smile on his face left no doubt that the woman below would catch him. He sailed directly into her arms, knocking her down.</p>
		<p>Having no idea what awaited her son's takeoff, Lacy crested the hill winded and readied to jump too until her concerned eyes came to rest upon her son tucked safely in the arms of a stranger. Stopping quickly, Dani took a place along side her mother. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>After recognizing that Derek had landed safely, she asked. "Did you see that, mom? He was flying like a plane." The levity her statement offered helped to alleviate the raging horror that had tornadoed though both of them. </p>
		<p>Lacy scrambled down around the rise to collect her son. Dani contemplated jumping the distance to the shoreline below, but quickly reconsidered. Instead, she followed the same path as her mother.</p>
		<p>Lying on her back, Gage smiled into the laughing face of the undaunted boy sitting on top of her. Noticing the still concerned face of what could only be the boy's mother rushing forward, Gage pushed up to a sitting position. "I take it this obviously fearless boy belongs to you."</p>
		<p>Lacy swooped her son into her arms temporarily ignoring her son's savior. Hugging him desperately, the mother kissed Derek's face over and over again. Following her mother's instincts, her eyes and hands roamed all over his body ensuring that he was unhurt. </p>
		<p>Dani soon arrived, carefully assessing the blonde stranger with a sharp quirk of an eye as Gage brushed herself off then stood erect. The young girl wondered what the stranger had did or said to get her bashful brother to jump off the ledge when she had no luck with him in playing along with her flying game on the airplane. With arms crossed, Dani silently let the scene unfold before her as she put on her invisible detective hat.</p>
		<p>The young girl's evident attitude directed at Gage did not go unnoticed. But, Gage altered her attention to mother and son. "He's okay?" As Gage stepped closer, Derek leaned toward her, grabbing at the writer. Lacy, loath to let go, finally did at her son's insistence. He immediately wrapped his right arm around Gage's neck then kissed her on the cheek, creating a rare blush that filled the writer's face. She then shifted her young charge to her side. </p>
		<p>Stunned at Derek's display of affection for the total stranger, Lacy thanked her son's savior profusely then introduced herself. "My name's Lacy Levine and this is my daughter." Pointing to a still quiet child. "And, well, I guess my son has already uniquely introduced himself to you. His name's Derek, by the way."</p>
		<p>Extending her hand, Gage peered into the amazing blue eyes of the boy's mother. "Gage Ballant." Quickly taking in the other woman's physique before nodding over her shoulder, Gage offered. "I'm staying at the cabin over there." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The warm hand that clasped around Lacy's hand sent an unexpected shiver through her. She returned the intense gaze of the writer establishing a bond between them that traveled beyond the physical. Surprised, they both felt a yearning calling them home. Undeniably, both knew the familiar link would linger long into the night. While this emotional exchanged confused Lacy, it brought clarity to the writer. </p>
		<p>Retrieving her hand, the writer shifted uncomfortably as Derek played with the mariner linked gold necklace around her neck. Gage sensed Lacy's need to hold her son again. "Here, back to your mom." With those encouraging words, Derek happily vaulted into his mother's waiting arms as a quick kiss and a hug awaited him.</p>
		<p>"Thank you again." Lacy smiled at Gage shyly. "We just arrived and was taking a look around before we unpacked." Feeling the need to explain why she lost sight of her son, Lacy continued. "Dani was collecting rocks on the shore and reminded me of something funny....big red hair." Gage's offered a raised eyebrow in question. "Anyway, that's no excuse to lose track of my son."</p>
		<p>"Hey, don't worry about it." The pain of guilt was evident on the actresses face. And Gage wanted to see her beautiful smile again. "I totally understand."</p>
		<p>"You have kids?" Lacy asked.</p>
		<p>"No." </p>
		<p>"Brothers and sisters?"</p>
		<p>"No." Hesitant, she continued. "Let me retract my earlier statement. I guess I don't understand. Never been around kids much actually." Dark thoughts loomed through the writer's head.</p>
		<p>Feeling she struck a nerve, Lacy changed the subject. "I guess we're going to be neighbors. Have you been here long?"</p>
		<p>"Bout five weeks." Gage's voice stumbled as she offered. "I... I could... ah, show you around once you get settled, I mean." Looking up slightly at Lacy, Gage recaptured the piercing blue she knew she would never stop wanting to gaze into. </p>
		<p>The bright smile that sprang on her mother's face was countered by an expression of annoyance dawning upon Dani's features. "We can explore on our own. Thank you very much."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Lacy cast her petulant daughter a dour look. "We would love it, wouldn't we, Dani?"</p>
		<p>Unenthusiastically, Dani agreed. "Yeah, I guess. Do you have anything interesting around here?" Keeping her tone in check. She didn't want another stern warning from her mother, but was unwilling to accept this total stranger into the fold so easily as her mother and brother apparently did. </p>
		<p>Gage thought frantically trying to remember what interested her as a child. "I've got a boat.... and there's a cave about a quarter of a mile past my cabin." The bright smile that popped up on the young girl's face clued Gage that she was on the right track. "If that interests you at all."</p>
		<p>Becoming aware of the uninvited spontaneous smile she now displayed in front of this stranger at the mention of the boat and cave, Dani reigned in her unchecked emotion. "Could be interesting...." She paused purposely. "If you let me drive the boat."</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Lacy was shocked at her daughter's continued attitude. </p>
		<p>"No. That's okay." Gage sent an engaging smile to Lacy, then redirected her attention to Dani who took serious note of the silent exchanges between her mother and the stranger. "How &#145;bout tomorrow we have a boat ride and check out the cave from the water?"</p>
		<p>With a quick glance to her mother, Dani displayed her best behavior. "Yes, that would be delightful. Thank you." Dani turned to leave.
			<i>Except for the boat ride and that cave, tomorrow may just very well be the longest day of my life. What's up with those looks anyway? </i>Dani didn't turn back as she continued on her way to their cabin.
		</p>
		<p>"I don't know what has gotten in her today. Ever since we've arrived, she's been...withdrawn. She's usually outgoing ...." Looking at Derek, she continued. "And he's the shy one. But you couldn't tell by the way things have gone today. He never takes to strangers. Never."</p>
		<p>Gage stroked Derek's soft cheek causing him to blush shyly with a sweet smile directed at his new best friend. "Tomorrow then?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely." Lacy reluctantly turned to leave, but Derek reached for Gage again. Lacy allowed her clearance as Gage stepped closer and Derek planted a wet kiss on her cheek.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Goodbye." Gage watched as Lacy turned away. </p>
		<p>Shaking her head at her son's uncharacteristic display, Lacy walked quietly back to their cabin resisting the urge to look back over her shoulder at the enigmatic woman who affected her so.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Four">
		<p>After an exhausting day, Lacy laid her dozing son on the bed. Leaning down she kissed him goodnight on the cheek. Derek desperately fought the onset of sleep when he again called. "Jage. Want Jage."</p>
		<p>"Honey, Gage isn't here. We'll get to see her tomorrow, okay?" His disappointment carved a frown on his face. Lacy tucked him in securely, dropping closer, she softly sang to him lulling him into a deep reluctant slumber. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Dani watched with dismay. Her brother had been asking for the stranger all night long.
			<i>I'm going to have to get to the bottom of this. </i>She continued to ponder why Derek was so attracted to the stranger and didn't notice her mother move up next to her.
		</p>
		<p>"Dani, come on. It's your turn." She nudged her daughter from her musings. "Did you brush your teeth?"</p>
		<p>She decided to address the issue directly. "Mom, why do you think Derek likes that..... stranger?" A menacing tone accompanied the last word spoken. </p>
		<p>Lacy directed Dani to her twin bed as she sat down beside her daughter. "What's with you today, Dani? Any other time, you're the one who's so open to..... strangers." Mimicking her daughter's tone. </p>
		<p>The young girl crunched her face at the mother's true words. "I don't know." Dani intended to drop the subject, but the following words spilled out softly before she could stop herself. "Derek used to just like us."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Recognizing the source of her daughter's problem, Lacy stroked Dani's face lightly. "He still does. And you are the most important person in his life. He adores you, you know."</p>
		<p>Brightly, Dani agreed. "He does, doesn't he?" Adding, "You too, mom. He loves you the most." Then after some thought, she continued. "And dad, right?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely." Lacy smiled. "I'm very lucky to have both of you." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The astute child noticed her mother did not include her father. "And dad too?" An insistent tone questioned.</p>
		<p>Lacy briefly allowed a far away thought to capture her attention. The slight nudge of an arm retrieved her thoughts back to the present. "And dad, too." She assured her daughter. "Now, it's time for you to get into bed. And, Dani?" Blue eyes piqued at her mother's question. "Tomorrow, would you please give Gage a chance? She did save your brother from getting hurt. Okay?"</p>
		<p>Dani nodded. But, in her mind, Derek would never have jumped from that hill unless he was sucked into it.
			<i>I'll give her a chance. </i>A devious smile crossed her face.
			<i>A chance to slip up.</i>
		</p>
		<i>
			<pspace/>
		</i>
		<p>Dani was about to climb under the covers when they heard a knock at the door. "Stay here." Lacy directed her daughter. Unable to comply simply due to her ever-present curiosity and protective nature toward her mother, Dani covertly followed Lacy out the bedroom door down the short hall where she took up a concealed position. </p>
		<p>She watched her mother complete the journey to the front entryway. Standing safely behind the locked door, Lacy called out. "Who is it?"</p>
		<p>"Ah, Mrs. Levine? It's Ned Raye." A friendly voice wafted through the three paned-covered glass door. "My mom dropped you off earlier. She wanted me to stop by and see if you're okay."</p>
		<p>Lacy was hesitant when she heard. "Can I come in?" Grasping the doorknob, she opened the door. A young good-looking boy around seventeen stood smiling at the prospect of meeting his favorite actress of all time.</p>
		<p>"Hi." Ned waved, then immediately noticed Lacy's blue eyes become aware of the guy behind him. Gesturing quickly to his friend. "Oh, this is Buddy Dunston."</p>
		<p>Buddy leaned forward extending his hand. "It's nice to meet you."</p>
		<p>"You too." Lacy was impressed with his good manners, letting go of his reluctant hand; she directed her question to Ned. "I thought your mom said you'd stop by in a day or two."</p>
		<p>"Oh, she did." Ned grabbed her hand, shaking it. He was already unhappy that Buddy seized the opportunity to touch the famous star first. "But, I've..." Buddy bumped him. "We've got an errand to run tomorrow out of town so we wouldn't be able to stop by." Ned smiled broadly as he offered his explanation.</p>
		<p>"I see." Lacy suspected that wasn't the real reason, taking in the leering looks on their faces. She ascertained it was more likely they couldn't wait to meet a real live television star. "Well, my husband should be here by the end of the week." She noticed their crestfallen faces. "I think we have everything we'll need until he gets here. And, besides, we have a boat trip planned for tomorrow with our neighbor in the next cabin. So, we'll be fine. Thanks. " Neither boy budged. "Although, if I do, I'll be sure to call."</p>
		<p>Both the young men perked up at that comment. "Cool." Ned pushed Buddy further from the door toward his mother's station wagon. "Bye." He waved, missing the first step off the porch. He caught himself before hitting the ground. Buddy snickered at his friend.</p>
		<p>Closing the door, Lacy twisted around noticing her oldest child at her stakeout post near the end of the hallway. "Everything okay?"</p>
		<p>"I was just going to ask you that." Dani countered. "What did they want?"</p>
		<p>She scooted her daughter down the hallway back to bed. "You tell me, I'm sure you heard every word." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The quick wink Lacy offered her daughter assured Dani she wasn't in trouble though she had formulated a different opinion of the two unwelcome late night guests. "I don't like them."
			<i>They're trouble, </i>she added silently.
		</p>
		<p>Tucking her daughter in, Lacy sat back on the bed. "Now, why does that not surprise me? You haven't liked anyone today."</p>
		<p>"Not true, I liked Grace." Diverting her mother's attention. "Do you think she's seen her new grandbaby yet?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. And don't think I didn't notice you change the subject, my little suspicious daughter."</p>
		<p>Dani decided not to share her reservations about the landlord's son and his friend. She figured her mother would not be as receptive as she usually was in these types of situations.
			<i>Must be because she's on vacation, </i>Dani concluded. Lacy was always concerned about the safety of her children ever since she'd become well-known, realizing the potential danger her children could be in due to her public persona.
		</p>
		<p>After kissing her daughter goodnight, Lacy flipped the light switch allowing darkness to fall. As Lacy checked the cabin's doors, she entertained the concerns her daughter had raised about the people they had met that day. Lacy first realized about a year ago Dani had developed a kind of sixth sense about people and decided not to dismiss her daughter's qualms. She pondered the day's events before Lacy allowed her mind to drift to the blonde haired woman in the cabin across the way.</p>
		<p>Lying in bed, Lacy stretched her long frame burying herself in the covers. The cool night air chilled the cabin. She had forgotten to adjust the thermostat earlier in the evening upon getting lost in the process of settling in for a month's stay. The last waking thought that ran through her head was of Gage's lingering green eyes that bled into her dreams. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Shutting off her laptop computer, Gage completed the final scene of her new screenplay, HERE COMES JORDAN.
			<i>Five weeks and presto, I've churned out another blockbuster.
			</i>Gage laughed out loud at her egotistical thought. "I'll be lucky if Mark likes it."
		</p>

		<p>Then her thoughts turned to the extraordinarily talented actress she'd met earlier.
			<i>I wonder if she'd like it. I could let her read it. </i>"Yeah, sure. Tomorrow I'll just mention it casually and see if she wants to read it."
			<i>No! What if she doesn't like it? And she'd feel obligated to say something nice if I did ask her to read it. </i>
		</p>
		<i>
			<pspace/>
		</i>
		<p>
			Gage picked up the draft copy of the screenplay from the printer, clamping it together.
			<i>Maybe I'll invite her and her kids back here after the boat ride and leave it out....laying..... </i>Gage searched for the most obvious place available
			<i>....right there. </i>Sitting it down then quickly retrieving it, she opened her leather satchel and shoved it in.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>That settled Gage went about getting ready for bed. Burying herself under the covers as she laid in the huge bed, Gage chuckled at the audacity Derek had shown when he leaped off that ledge. Right before he jumped, she recognized something in his eyes that roared loudly the conviction he had in her that she would catch him. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>That kind of blind faith shook Gage to the core. No one ever expressed such belief in her before except, of course, for Mark. And, she felt she didn't deserve his unwavering devotion.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>A trip down memory lane offered Gage a moment to ponder her relationship with Mark. When Gage opened the letter from the America's Best Writing competition, the words
			<i>&#145;Thank you for entering our competition, but</i>....' leaped off the page at her. She tossed it aside to keep company with the numerous other rejection letters making their way quickly to the ceiling. Gage came up with a saying of sorts to help her handle these types of letters.
			<i>I use rejections as stepping-stones on my way to success. </i>
		</p>
		<p>So it shocked her when she answered the telephone the next week and someone she had never met was offering to buy her first screenplay, A QUESTION OF MURDER. Within two weeks, Gage and Mark had hammered out a deal to produce her screenplay. To Gage's delight, Mark revealed his long desire to start his own production company, asking her to join him in his new venture. </p>
		<p>Even with the success of two murder/mystery books to her credit, Gage longed to write and produce screenplays. So she jumped at the chance into the symbolic arms of her knight in shining armor. Not unlike what the little boy had done earlier in the day with her.</p>
		<p>Mark and Gage quickly became friends after discovering both had experienced difficult times during their lives. Each had suffered great losses, Mark lost his wife and parents in an airplane accident and Gage never even got to know that kind of family relationship in her life.</p>
		<p>These thoughts led to another family across the way.
			<i>I bet they're all sleeping right now. </i>The love mother had for son and vice versa permeated the air when Lacy encased her little daredevil in her arms. Gage smiled in contemplation briefly only to find her thoughts going along another path in wonder about the young girl who exhibited a distinct reservation toward her.
			<i>I've got to do something about that.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>She didn't know why it was so important to her that this family like her, but Gage determined to do just that. The niggling feeling that pestered her thoughts demanded it, and it declared loudly with a thundering roar that her life would never reach true happiness if she failed. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Five">
		<p>Gage Ballant paced outside Cabin C wondering if she should knock. She'd been up at the crack of dawn, editing her screenplay, straightening up the cabin, just in case, and fixing several sandwiches. Basically, just killing time until she thought it appropriate to see if Lacy and her kids were ready for their planned excursion. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Now after twenty minutes waiting in the cool morning air and not seeing a light come on in the cabin, Gage swung around back toward her cabin when she heard. "Jage."</p>
		<p>Happily, Derek sprang across the porch to the steps. Lacy from behind and Gage out in front rushed in tandem toward him. "Oh, no. Not again, young man." Gage halted his progress, but had no affect on the beaming smile that welcomed her. Leaping up the stairs, Gage gave the little boy a big hug; which seemed to be returned tenfold. </p>
		<p>"He's usually hard to get up in the mornings." Lacy offered. </p>
		<p>Gage rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. "Me, too." </p>
		<p>Lacy continued. "Not today though. He was tugging at my covers bright and early insisting I get out of bed."</p>
		<p>The writer sent the actress a questioning look. "I tried to persuade him to sleep in a little longer which turned into an all out tickle war when Dani joined in after jumping in my bed."</p>
		<p>Gage pondered a delicious idea. "So your ticklish." Realization dawned on her.
			<i>God, did I just say that out loud?</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Only a lucky few get to know that." Lacy bantered back. Suddenly turning around and entering the cabin, her skin flushed at her own unexpected boldness.</p>
		<p>Swallowing hard, Gage whispered. "Lucky? I am lucky." She confirmed. "Though I'm not sure I could get that lucky." Doubt filled her thoughts. Shifting her eyes to Derek, she asked her potential ally. "You're on my side, right?" His only response, a neutral giggle. </p>
		<p>Within ten minutes, Gage was leading Lacy and her kids to the boathouse in front of her cabin. "I thought we could take a trip around the lake first. Just to get a general idea of the layout. Then..."</p>
		<p>Remembering to be polite, Dani interjected. "Our mother was practically raised here. Her brothers and sister came up here to visit my great-grandparents every summer. So, I'm sure she doesn't need to get the... general layout." Although, her voice was velvety sweet, it left the bitter taste she intended. </p>
		<p>Gage stopped Lacy before she could chastise her daughter. "You're right. I shouldn't have assumed. And the assumption I made about you...." A pause created the affect she desired, getting Dani's full attention. "....is probably wrong, too."</p>
		<p>Dani cast her a looming look, careful not to go too far and push her mother's mood over the edge.</p>
		<p>Gage opened the wide boathouse door allowing everyone to peer inside. "I assumed you'd be a natural at navigating....." Gage pointed through the front door of the boathouse.</p>
		<p>Excited blue eyes practically popped out of her head at the sight of the fire red ski boat. She rushed in ready to fulfill one of her lifelong dreams. Dani loved water. Any kind. Whether walking in the rain, swimming in it, drinking it or washing in it, but especially being the captain of her own boat sailing the seven seas. "No, you got that one right." Dani offered Gage her most sincere smile to date.</p>
		<p>"Dani, you've never driven a boat." Lacy supplied.</p>
		<p>"Yes, but I am a natural. Just like Gage said." Dani took her place along side her new best friend, willing her mother to defy her. Taking hold of Gage's hand, Dani then looked purposely at her mother. "You're not saying she's wrong, are you?"</p>
		<p>"No, no." She admitted. "I'm not going to win this one, am I?" Lacy threw up her hands in surrender. </p>
		<p>Smiling up at Gage who was holding her brother, Dani asked politely through strained excitement. "Can we get in now, please?"</p>
		<p>Surveying their clothes, Gage questioned. "Did you bring your swimsuits?"</p>
		<p>Lacy raised the bag she was carrying.</p>
		<p>"It's bound to warm up today. Why don't you put them on under your clothes before we get out on the water? That way we'll be ready for anything." Gage suggested.</p>
		<p>"I guess we should have did that back at the cabin." Lacy's words created a dejected look to spill across Dani's face. She was becoming impatient in her desire to get behind the helm of her very first boat.</p>
		<p>Gage took a couple steps to a door inside the large boathouse and pushed it open. "You can change in here."</p>
		<p>Lacy scanned the small, but spacious room. "It has a bed in there?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well, this place belongs to a good friend of mine. He has a chauffer, sort of a personal assistant that goes with him just about everywhere. And..., well, Chance prefers to sleep in the boathouse even though there's two bedrooms in the cabin." Gage shrugged her shoulders, preferring not to divulge anymore.</p>
		<p>Dani unconcerned with why there was literally a bedroom in the boathouse pulled her mother inside and closed the door. "Let's get changed."</p>
		<p>With a speed that matched the roadrunner, Dani changed then stepped back outside offering a brief glimpse of a semi-naked Lacy as she changed into her swimsuit. Startled, Lacy commanded. "Dani, close the door."</p>
		<p>Gage averted her eyes, but couldn't keep the satisfied grin that saturated her face at bay. Quickly, pretending to adjust Derek's shirt, she let the sexy vision she'd just witnessed flood her mind over and over again.</p>
		<p>"Jeez. Hurry up, will ya?" Dani re-buttoned her top as she moved closer to the boat. </p>
		<p>When the inside door finally opened again, Dani met the disapproving eyes of her mother. "Sorry, mom."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Hoping to help the young girl escape retribution, Gage said. "Let's get going already. We're burning daylight." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Surprised, but delighted that Gage was trying to divert her mother's warning eyes off of her, Dani's mouthed a silent &#145;thank you'. It did the trick as Lacy took possession of her son to get him changed into his swimsuit.</p>
		<p>Gage shrugged her shoulders at Dani and gave a quick wink, creating the first bond between them.
			<i>Well, I couldn't let her get in trouble. After all, she did inadvertently do me a huge favor. </i> As hard as she tried, Gage could not wipe that happy smile off her face much to Lacy's dismay.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>After jumping in the boat, Gage meticulously went over some general safety instructions showing everyone the location of the kill switch, fire extinguisher and the extra life jackets. Placing her cellular phone on the boat's console, she said. "And this, I usually carry it with me wherever I go, just in case." </p>
		<p>Unusually patient, Dani astutely paid attention and held very still as Gage strapped her life jacket on. Lacy, in turn, did the same for her son. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>With one quick check to see if everyone was ready, Gage fired up the engine and the crew was off for their great day of adventure. Dani slipped easily in front of Gage taking her captain's role very seriously while Lacy lounged on the back seat of the boat with Derek.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Within an hour they had reached the other side of the lake, having followed the shoreline cruising at a low speed under the watchful eye of the young captain. "When are we going to get to the cave you talked about Gage?" Dani carefully guided the boat past a small marina.</p>
		<p>"It's a little ways further. Just keep heading East." Gage answered. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Dani eyed the compass on the dash in front of her. Remembering how Gage showed her how to read it, she turned the wheel to the right slightly. A tap on her shoulder drew her attention. "What?"</p>
		<p>Gage pointed to the sandy beach just East of the marina. "Just beyond that beach, that's where the county fair is going to be."</p>
		<p>Fondly remembering the fun she and her siblings had at the fair, Lacy asked. "Do you know when it is this summer?"</p>
		<p>Over her shoulder, Gage said. "The weekend after this coming one." A hesitant pause filled the air. "Do you plan on being here that long?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. Yes, we do." Thinking it would be a great idea to take her kids, Lacy asked Gage. "You?"</p>
		<p>Even if Gage had planned to leave earlier than that, she would have immediately changed her plans if it meant spending more time with them. But, the thrill of that prospect deflated at Dani's next words.</p>
		<p>"Great. Dad will be up here by then." Dani bounced a couple of times on Gage's lap at the impending arrival of her father. "Then we can all go, right mom?"</p>
		<p>"Sure. All of us." Lacy's voice lacked the thrill of excitement at the mention of her husband. She realized she hadn't given David a thought since she arrived at the cabin. Directing her attention on Gage. "You'll still be here?" She asked, with a weak but hopeful tone.</p>
		<p>Suddenly sullen, Gage smiled bleakly at Lacy. "Yeah."
			<i>Great, she's married. Don't know how I overlooked that rock on her ring finger.</i>
		</p>
		<i>
			<pspace/>
		</i>
		<p>Thinking ahead, Dani came up with another reason to be captain of the fine vessel she was guiding effortlessly through the water. "Good because we'll need the boat to get there."</p>
		<p>"Dani, we can't just expect Gage to chauffer us around. We can drive the long way around the lake." Lacy offered feebly, although it was the last thing she wanted.</p>
		<p>Dani swiveled around to her mother. "But she's coming with us." Then looked at Gage. "Right, Gage?" The young captain thought quickly. She wanted another reason to climb behind the wheel. "Please."</p>
		<p>"Well, ahhh....either way, though, I'm sure Mark....my friend, wouldn't mind you using it even if I didn't tag along." Gage felt awkward about the prospect of being a third wheel when the husband showed up.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"No, we're not going to use the boat if you're not with us, Gage." Lacy said flatly, finding it unacceptable to go without her new friend. "And we wouldn't have as much fun without you there."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>With a reluctant nod, Gage proffered a vague agreement. "Yeah."</p>
		<p>Quickly, Dani closed the discussion. "It's settled then."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>After a quiet ten minutes of cruising, they finally reached the water entrance of the cave. Gage helped Dani guide the boat to a small cove to the left of the cavern. "We can't get to the cave from here, but I thought we'd anchor here awhile. Maybe do some swimming, it's pretty shallow."</p>
		<p>Gage flipped the switch, killing the engine. She gently lifted Dani from her lap and reached for a basket under the console. "And have some lunch, what'd ya say?"</p>
		<p>"That would be great." Lacy said, then Derek hopped off her now that Gage's lap was vacant. "Thanks for bringing the food." Sighing, "Some mother I am. It didn't even occur to me."</p>
		<p>Patting her mother's knee, Dani consoled her. "We still love you, mom." Having done her daughterly duty, Dani rolled her eyes.
			<i>Who cares about food? </i>"Can we explore the cave now?" Her excitement spilled out.
		</p>
		<p>"Honey, as I recall, we can't get to the cave from this side."</p>
		<p>"You're mother's right. We'd either have to climb up over it or head back to the cabin and take the trail from the other side to get there." Seeing the dejected expression Dani displayed, Gage offered. "Before we take off, we'll get a closer look from the water. Okay?"</p>
		<p>It wasn't the answer Dani wanted, but she considered herself a reasonable kid and offered a compromise. "Tomorrow then?"</p>
		<p>"We'll see. Maybe later in the week." Temporarily defeated, Dani figured she'd have to settle with her mother's uncertain promise. She rebounded quickly, stripping out of her clothes down to her swimsuit. She was determined to salvage the rest of the day filling it with fun. Dani stepped up on the side of the boat, jumping in the water. A splash rained on Gage and her new lap partner who just giggled at his sister's antic. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>During the next few hours, they ate, swam and Gage showed Dani how to tie a few sailor's knots. Having explained it was a mandatory skill expected of all good Captains, so Dani gave it her full attention. She expertly learned several knots and was eagerly ready to add more to her arsenal before her mother stopped the lessons when Gage started to show her how to tie a hangman's knot. Before they headed back home, Gage helped Dani guide the boat for a closer inspection of the cave's entryway with a promise to explore it in a few days causing a concerned look from Lacy.</p>
		<p>The clouds turned dark overhead and the threat of rain beckoned from the sky. The gushing wind picked up giving them a choppy water ride back to the boathouse. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Six">
		<p>A few sprinkles fell from the sky just as they left the boathouse en route back to their cabins. Gage insisted on escorting them along the path as the sky cracked with thunder. Derek clung to her as each bolt of lighting flashed across the sky, wind whipping through the air.</p>
		<p>Carrying Dani up the steps onto the porch, Lacy stopped short upon noticing the sliding door ajar. Swirling around, she caught Gage's eyes, joining her on the porch with Derek in her arms. The frightened mother let Dani slide down as Gage stepped in front of her handing Lacy her son. The young mother pushed Dani back away from the door, shielding her.</p>
		<p>"Momma." Derek whimpered, hanging tightly to his mother. Even as the storm raged, an eerie silence surrounded them. Scared, Dani wrapped her arms around her mother, anchoring herself against the unknown danger that swept chills though her body, raising the bumps on her skin. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Stay here." Gage entered the cabin. The dark sky's ambient light from the lingering lightning provided just enough illumination to scan the living room and adjourning kitchen. Gage immediately noticed the broken glass from the three paned front door. A loose shutter whacked the side of the house spurring Gage to practically jump out of her skin. But it was the bedroom door creaking open that persuaded her to take immediate action. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Come on." Her tone brooked no argument. Grabbing Lacy's hand, Gage led her and the kids down the steps along the path to her own cabin. Pushing the back door open, the four piled in just before the heavens opened up with an onslaught of water, light and thunder.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Rain beating down hard on the rooftop as the furious storm raged outside, Gage called the sheriff's department reporting the break-in. Lacy settled the kids on the couch then went in search for a couple of towels. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy reentered the living room to find Derek clinging to Gage on the couch with Dani snuggling close by. A bolt of lightning cast a streak across the room followed by a clap of thunder, jolting Lacy. Calming herself, she asked. "Are they coming?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah. We'll wait here while they check your place." Gage shifted, making room for Lacy to join them. "Sit down."</p>
		<p>Handing Gage a towel to dry Derek, Lacy wrapped the other towel around her chilled daughter rubbing a bit of moisture from her hair and face dry. Dani climbed on her mother's lap leaving a spot between the two adults open, which the actress unconsciously closed. Their arms brushed together sparking welcomed warmth between them carrying a familiar comfort felt by the touch. </p>
		<p>Lacy gaped into green eyes and the soothing feeling she found there converged upon her entire being, seducing her into a sense of complete and utter trust for the woman who had become a necessary ingredient in her family's life. Somehow even in the mist of lurking danger, Lacy felt safe. Comforted by this feeling, the dark haired woman leaned her head on Gage's shoulder as the blonde held the star's son tightly. With Dani in her arms, they waited. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>An hour later, a loud knock jolted the cabin's occupants. "I'll get it." Gage said, handing Derek to his mother. The writer opened the door after the sheriff identified himself. </p>
		<p>Stepping inside with his deputy, Sheriff Baylor, removed his wet hat. "Ms. Ballant?"</p>
		<p>"Please call me Gage." She released his hand then turned to the much younger deputy.</p>
		<p>The tall, light haired deputy claimed her hand, flashing a magnetic smile. "Deputy Simmons. But you can call me Ted." He noticed the sheriff's slight disapproving glance.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The sixty-year-old sheriff grunted. "You're the one that called about the break-in?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. This is my cabin." Pointing to Lacy seated on the couch, she continued. "Mrs. Levine... she's the one that is staying over there."</p>
		<p>Nodding, he directed his attention to Lacy who gave Derek to his sister then stood up. Coming up to stand next to Gage, Lacy welcomed the two officers. </p>
		<p>"Ma'am, we have a few questions and we'll need you to go with us to see if anything is missing." The sheriff informed her.</p>
		<p>Glimpsing the uneasy look forming on Lacy's face, Gage offered an alternative. "Sheriff, we'd be glad to answer any of your questions, but would it be possible for Mrs. Levine to go in the morning. With the weather and.... well....." Gage directed his attention to the two scared children on the couch.</p>
		<p>The sheriff hesitated.
			<i>Damn, I wanted to get this done tonight. </i>The sheriff's frown did not go unnoticed by the deputy. "Sheriff, I'll do it. I could come back by early and go with Mrs. Levine. Take care of the reports and everything." Deputy Simmons betted the sheriff would take up his offer. He knew the Sheriff had plans for his day off.
		</p>
		<p>"You sure? You're off tomorrow." The sheriff questioned, but was silently pleased.</p>
		<p>Throwing the raven-haired star a charismatic smile, the deputy said. "Absolutely, it would be my pleasure."</p>
		<p>Shaking his head at this deputy's relentless flirting ways, the sheriff redirected Ted's attention. "And you're job."</p>
		<p>Donning a serious professional demeanor, the deputy clipped his heels and assured his boss. "Yes, sir."</p>
		<p>"Okay, Mrs. Levine, my deputy will need to get some information." Seeing her nod okay, the sheriff looked at his deputy. "Ted, I'll go seal the door on the cabin that way in the morning you'll know if anything's been disturbed."</p>
		<p>Familiar with the procedure, the deputy nodded, turning his attention to Lacy. "Ma'am?"</p>
		<p>Lacy answered the handsome deputy's questions stating that they had only arrived the day before and knew no one in the area except for Sally Raye, the landlord, who rented her the cabin, and, of course, Gage. She further explained that they had been out all day boating.</p>
		<p>He stated that he would inform Sally about the break in then the deputy provided the results of the search they had conducted earlier. "Other than the broken glass from the front door, we couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. Though, it does look like someone went through your belongings, but we won't know if anything is missing until we check it tomorrow. You know, money or personal effects."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"They didn't get any money. I had my purse with me all day." Lacy supplied, smiling at the young man.</p>
		<p>"Great then." He touched her knee reassuringly and smiled, spawning a jealous glare from Gage. Oblivious to the writer, the deputy offered. "Can I take you to a motel or something.... for tonight?"</p>
		<p>Gage inserted quickly. "They're staying with me." She bolted off the chair, herding him out the door. "I think I heard the sheriff drive up." With a sigh of relief, Gage closed the door, ridding the over zealous officer out of their lives.
			<i>At least until morning then he'll be back... smiling, touching. Great! </i>This jealous thought weighed heavily on Gage's mind.
		</p>
		<p>Rubbing her forehead in deep contemplation, Gage was drawn from her thoughts at the sound of Lacy's soft velvety voice. "Gage, are you sure? We could get a motel room."</p>
		<p>"No!" Gage shouted, reeling her alarmed emotions back in at the idea of them leaving. "I mean, you don't have to....I... I want you to stay. That is if you want."</p>
		<p>"I want to stay." Dani jumped in, somewhat surprised to find she had no desire to leave especially after having been determined not to like the stranger.
			<i>I mean Gage. </i>Wanting to cement her plan, she added. "And Derek does too." She nudged him off her lap toward Gage.
		</p>
		<p>Derek happily complied. He ran to the writer's arms as she swooped him up. An imploring smile sent to his mother capped her decision. Of course, Lacy had no desire to part company with Gage and was easily swayed.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"It's settled then." Lacy contemplated her next thought. "Though we don't have anything to sleep in."</p>
		<p>"Our swimsuits." Dani suggested seriously. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>A shared chuckle from Lacy and Gage filled the room. "I think we can come up with something that will do.... at least for tonight."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Seven">
		<p>Gage clumsily helped Lacy prepare her children for bed. Having no experience with raising children, she was in awe of Lacy's infinite patience with her energetic off springs as they cheerfully splashed through their bath and scampered around the room while both Lacy and Gage tried to corral the racing children into their nightclothes.</p>
		<p>Even two of the smallest tee shirts Gage had tented the young boy and his sister. Although, Dani's borrowed nightwear fit more like an baggy shirt, Derek simply got lost in his loaned tee shirt. But it didn't faze either child, happy to be fed and clean. Lacy slipped into an extra pair of jogging clothes Gage had brought along.</p>
		<p>Settling her charges in the spare bedroom, Gage said her goodnights at the door. "If you need anything, I'm right down the hall. Although, I wished you would have taken the master bedroom."</p>
		<p>"Nonsense, Gage. We're perfectly fine here. Derek can sleep with me and the other twin bed will be fine for Dani."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure? It has a huge bed and you could all sleep together." Gage felt bad about the arrangement. The master bedroom offered not only more space, but also a private bathroom and she thought the family would feel safer sleeping together especially after the break in at their cabin. Suddenly, a loud clap of roaring thunder filled the air, startling everyone.
			<i>And then there's the storm outside. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy summoned her courage, reaffirming. "Really we're good here."</p>
		<p>Reluctantly, Gage waved goodbye. "Okay, I'll check the doors and windows before I go to bed. Goodnight."</p>
		<p>With Dani tucked in her bed, Lacy pulled the covers up, burying herself and her son. She listened to Gage's soft footsteps travel throughout the cabin until silence filled the room.
			<i>She must be in bed now. I don't know what we would have done without her tonight.
			</i>Another deafening slap of thunder on the heels of a lightning bolt shrouded the room in light. Dani stirred, Derek pushed closer and Lacy wished Gage was there with them.
			<i>My God, what am I thinking? She's right down hall. Yet, I want her here... with us. I feel so, I don't know, protected with her near.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Gage yanked the covers, snugly fitting them around her. The storm outside beat against the cabin relentlessly.
			<i>I better check the boathouse first thing in the morning. </i>Suddenly, remembering.
			<i>No, that will have to wait. That young deputy will be here for Lacy bright and early. She can't handle the kids and search for missing belongings. So, I'll have to go with her. </i>That settled, Gage smiled, turned on her side facing the opened doorway. After a few moments, Gage slipped into a light sleep.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The piercing boom of thunder broke Gage from her light dozing. Dragging her sleepy eyes open, a flash of lightning silhouetted a small figure dwarfed by a taller one holding something in its grasp framed within the doorway. Rubbing her eyes, Gage alertly sat up.</p>
		<p>"Gage?" A soft velvety voice called.</p>
		<p>"Lacy. What is it?" Gage pushed back the covers, edging near the side of the bed.</p>
		<p>"Can we sleep with you?" Lacy was relieved by her daughter's request.</p>
		<p>Hopping back, Gage allowed plenty of room in the king size bed for her welcomed and, apparently, eager guests as Dani lunged forward. "Of course, get in here."</p>
		<p>Dani crawled in the middle of the bed, planting herself. Lacy eased Derek down who then immediately climbed on top of Gage. After Lacy laid down, she reached for her son. "Derek, honey, come sleep over here with me." He refused to budge, wanting to be in the middle. "Dani, you sleep on the other side of me, okay?"</p>
		<p>She frowned. "I want to sleep next to Gage." Having secured a new first mate, Dani wanted to keep close ties to the owner of the boat to which she had become the self-appointed captain.</p>
		<p>"Come on, Dani. I want Derek in the middle." Her mother commanded.</p>
		<p>"Then I'll sleep on the other side of Gage." Before another word was spoken, she vaulted over the writer. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Derek settled in between his mother and Gage while Dani made herself comfortable. Worried a bit by their uninvited intrusion and her daughter's stubbornness, Lacy questioned Gage. "Is this okay? I mean..."</p>
		<p>Feeling a bit awkward with both kids on either side of her, yet at the same time Gage savored the hominess she felt with them near. "Yeah, I think I'll live." Cemented firmly between the two human walls. "Won't be able to turn, but I'll manage."</p>
		<p>For some reason, even as the storm outside continued in its fitful rage, the kids seemed oblivious to it. Dani started spieling out question upon question to Gage about when could they ride in the boat again and if tomorrow would be a good day to explore the cave while Derek giggled at his sister's non-stop queries.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy turned toward Gage, trying to settle her wiggling son between them. The ambient light from the stormy sky fell softly on the trusting features of the writer. "Sorry. She's rather inquisitive. And he..." Tickling her son. "...won't stay still."</p>
		<p>"It's okay." Gage had an idea. "Hey. If you two settle down and go to sleep, tomorrow night I'll tell you a story of the Shanglon Master and the woman he loved. What'd ya say?"</p>
		<p>"You tell stories?" Dani sat up.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. Mostly I just write them though."</p>
		<p>Derek clapped his hands. "Stories...yea."</p>
		<p>"What kind of stories?" Lacy inquired.</p>
		<p>"Good ones, I'd like to think." She smiled at Lacy who in turned did the same. "It's been a long day, so tonight we sleep and tomorrow... a story."</p>
		<p>"First, tell me about the story." Excited, Dani couldn't contain herself.</p>
		<p>"Dani. Sleep." Her mother's voice brooked no argument.</p>
		<p>"Jeez. I just wanted to know about the Shanglon Master." She pouted, but did as she was requested.</p>
		<p>For a few moments silence reigned until Dani turned on her side, propping her head up with her arm. "Gage, how did you get your name anyway?"</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>A dark memory came barreling to the forefront of her mind. "My mother."</p>
		<p>Seriously, Dani asked. "Didn't she like you?"</p>
		<p>A hearty laugh escaped Gage as Lacy scolded her daughter. "Dani, that's not nice."</p>
		<p>"Sorry." Dani scooted back down, tucking the covers around her. Mumbling, she couldn't help, but add. "Jeez, it is a weird name, you know."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eight">
		<p>Through the night as the storm fizzled out, Gage, Lacy and the kids fell into a restful sleep. Sometime in the night a drowsy three year old climbed on top of Gage leaving a vacant space between Lacy and the writer which did not remain empty for long as they naturally gravitated toward each other.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>As dawn peeked its radiant head, Gage woke from a peaceful sleep. She immediately felt the warmth of Lacy's body curled up against her. Gage stretched, adjusting the small boy lying on her stomach, twisting her body on her side slightly as she turned away from Lacy, she glanced at Dani who slept quietly.
			<i>I can't think of any other place I'd rather be. </i>Naturally a late sleeper, Gage acquiesced the urge to fall back to sleep easily. With a satisfied smile, happy, content and feeling the love of a real family, Gage closed her eyes.
		</p>
		<p>Some time later, Lacy not fully awake, burrowed closer to the writer next to her. Fitting her long, slender form next to Gage like a glove, Lacy sighed in contentment. She smiled in the warmth that greeted her. Blue eyes popped open as she realized just whom she was snuggling up against. As shock dawned into comprehension of how they ended up together in the same bed, Lacy eased back away from the writer. But the immediate sense of loss overwhelmed her drawing her back next to Gage, snuggling even closer.
			<i>I can't think of any other place I'd rather be. </i>This unexpected thought startled the star, but she didn't budge from the place she had secured next to the writer, which strangely felt like home.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy refused to dwell on these invading thoughts that could threaten her present way of life. Instead, she tucked them away, blaming them on the stressful events of the last few days. Naturally an early riser, Lacy fought the urge to get up. Happy, content and safe surrounded by the ones she loved Lacy closed her eyes.</p>
		<p>A few long moments passed when small giggles woke Lacy from her light sleep. She met her son's bright smile as he leaned over Gage, grabbing at his mother. Propping herself up on her elbow, Lacy reached over Gage and kissed her son good morning. He smiled then fell back between Gage and his sister, giggling. "Come on. Give me a kiss." She said.</p>
		<p>"No." His small hands hid his face.</p>
		<p>"Please. Just one little kiss. Okay?" She encouraged her son to return the good morning kiss. </p>
		<p>Shaking his head, Derek wiggled.</p>
		<p>Still sleeping, Gage shifted slightly back toward Lacy away from the small boy causing mother and child both to giggle at having almost awoken the writer. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Shhhhh." Lacy waited for Gage to finally settle. "Now, come on, sweetheart, how bout a good morning kiss. Please." She implored.</p>
		<p>From the depths of a light sleep, Gage heard the inviting plea. Eyes slowly dragging open, she turned to the sound of an intoxicating voice calling her.
			<i>Kiss me. Is that what she said? </i> Sleepy green gazed into waiting blue, debating the proffered request. Gage wetted her lips in anticipation.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy swallowed hard at the realization of what Gage was thinking.
			<i>She thinks I want her to kiss me. Do I? My God, where did that come from? </i>Lacy dismissed the thought as easily as it had come.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Suddenly, Derek bolted up and over Gage at his mother, placing a wet kiss upon her cheek. He fell between them laughing at his antics, disrupting what may have been.</p>
		<p>Gage pushed back away from Lacy, bumping up against Dani. "Hey, what'd doing trying to push me outta bed?" Dani protested. "If you wanted me to move, you coulda just asked."</p>
		<p>Thankful for Dani's early morning grumbling, Gage negotiated her way out of the huge bed.
			<i>My God, I almost kissed her. What the hell would she have thought? What the hell was I thinking? She only wanted to kiss her son....not me. </i>Gage stumbled around the room a bit, searching for something, anything to divert her thoughts from what almost happened. Tripping over a chair, Gage swooped up her clothes, then headed for the connecting bathroom. "I'll be right back."
		</p>
		<p>Lacy watched in amusement as Gage frantically recoiled from the near kiss.
			<i>I wonder how she would have reacted if we'd actually kissed. </i>That consideration drove Lacy deeper into her musings, questioning her own feelings.
		</p>
		<p>"What's wrong with her?" Dani asked, wiping the sleep out of her eyes. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"I've got it." Lacy whipped around Gage, grabbing the sausage filled skillet as the writer filled several glasses of orange juice. The kids waited patiently. Well, as patiently as Dani could. </p>
		<p>"We're going to explore the cave today, right?" Dani asked her mother. "Mom? Right?"</p>
		<p>Lacy filled the plates full of food, ignoring her daughter. Her mind still lingering on the kiss she almost shared with Gage. As she sat a plate in front of Dani, she felt a tug at her arm. "Hmmmm?"</p>
		<p>"Are we going to go to the cave or not?" Dani demanded. But soon regretted her sharp tone when her mother's blue eyes met her own in disapproval.</p>
		<p>Gage quietly sat next to Derek, helping him as he ate his breakfast. Her thoughts lingered on the early morning events. She could still feel the longing, the tingling at the mere idea of brushing her lips up against the sweet smile that now adorned the star's face. Catching herself staring at Lacy, Gage reined her emotions in at the sound of Dani's question.</p>
		<p>"Gage, can we go to the cave today?" Dani decided to redirect her inquiry as her mother's mind was obviously on something else only to find that Gage was equally not in the present. </p>
		<p>Before Gage could answer, Lacy spoke up. "No, honey. The sheriff will be by today. I've got to go back to the cabin and see if anything is missing and...." She looked poignantly at Gage. "Maybe get some of our things, I guess."</p>
		<p>Gage immediately heard the reluctance in her voice. "You're not going back there. I mean you're going to stay here, right? I mean, the window's broken and who ever it was might come back and...."
			<i>Great! Now she won't want to stay.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			A knock at the door temporarily prevented Lacy from answering. Lacy rose from the table to let the young deputy in. "Deputy. Please come in. Would you like some breakfast?" She walked back to the kitchen, the deputy close on her heels.
		</p>
		<p>"No....no, thanks. And please call me Ted." He smiled sweetly.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I'll be right with you."
			Lacy called, stopping him from venturing further into the kitchen area where the family was enjoying their breakfast. Gage had been watching closely the interaction between the star and the deputy when Lacy leaned down to her. "Are you sure you don't mind if we stay a little longer? At least until...."
		</p>
		<p>"No. I mean, stay as long as you like." Gage released a breath she didn't know she was holding. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy squeezed the writer's shoulder in thanks. "Then would you mind staying with the kids while I go? I don't want them to have to go back there."</p>
		<p>Casting a quick glimpse at the unreasonably handsome deputy, Gage reluctantly agreed with her. "Sure, we'll find something to do." Standing up, concerned green eyes looked deeply at Lacy. "I'd rather you didn't go alone though....maybe I could go instead."</p>
		<p>Without thinking Lacy hugged Gage briefly. "Thank you." Her blue eyes filled with appreciation for the concern her new friend had shown. "But, you wouldn't know if something was missing. Believe me, knowing you are taking care of the kids while I do this.... well, I appreciate it."</p>
		<p>Gage walked Lacy and the deputy to the door, watching them drive off, she returned to the kitchen table wishing Lacy were back already.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The young deputy led the way, searching the cabin thoroughly before allowing Lacy inside. "It's okay to come in now. Everything looks about the same as last night."</p>
		<p>Lacy scanned the living room and adjoining kitchen. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until she entered her bedroom. Her clothes and some personal items were scattered haphazardly on the floor and bed. Lacy immediately began sorting through them, picking up the items off the floor. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Trying to be of help, the deputy reached for a few items pulling up a pair of red panties offering it to her. </p>
		<p>"Thanks." Lacy grabbed them from him.</p>
		<p>He blushed after realizing just what he had given her. Jumping up, he stepped back. "I guess you can get the rest. I'll check the other rooms. You'll be okay here?"</p>
		<p>She nodded. Glad to be alone, Lacy collected the rest of her belongings. A short while later, with bag in hand, she walked into the living room to find Ted jotting down some notes in his logbook. "Other than some clothing and a broach, everything seems to be here."</p>
		<p>Looking up from his notes, the deputy smiled. "I'll need a list of the missing items."</p>
		<p>"Just some of my clothes. Nothing of the kids stuff." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I'll need specifics, if you don't mind." Ted offered her a seat at the kitchen table. "For my report."</p>
		<p>Embarrassed, Lacy reluctantly informed him. "Okay, some bras and underwear."</p>
		<p>Putting pen to paper, the deputy repeated. "Bras and under...." Realization hit him. "That's it?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, besides the broach, of course."</p>
		<p>They spent the next few minutes detailing the description of the broach and underwear for the report before the deputy scooted his chair backwards. Noting that Lacy mentioned a red lacy bra was missing, the deputy quickly deduced it probably was the match to the pair of red lacy panties he picked up earlier. "I'll help you get the rest of your things together and we can go now. Do you want a ride to town or something?"</p>
		<p>Without notice the front door to the cabin opened, startling them. Toting a tool bag in one hand and a brown paper covered rectangular sheet under the other arm, Ralph walked in, grunted at the intruders then dropped the bag on the floor. "Deputy."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Ralph, what are you doing here?" The deputy asked.</p>
		<p>"Ms. Raye asked me to come by and fix the door." He slipped on a pair of gloves. Picking at the broken glass still lodged in the doorframe, Ralph ignored them.</p>
		<p>"I guess it's okay. The boys already did a check of the place. And we're through here." He glanced at Lacy who nodded in agreement.</p>
		<p>Grabbing a couple of bags, an unsettling shiver shot through Lacy as she walked around the handyman who reluctantly moved aside. "Excuse me."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>His dark brown eyes bore a hole in her as she passed through the door to the porch. "Mrs. Levine." He said with a menacing tone, leering at her.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The handyman's demeanor did not go unnoticed by the young deputy who also spied a pane of glass that appeared to be a perfect replacement for the one that was broken. "What's that?"</p>
		<p>"It's going in here." The handyman grunted, pointing to the empty hole in the door.</p>
		<p>"How'd you know what size you'd need?" The deputy asked suspiciously.</p>
		<p>"Had an extra. These things get broken all the time with different people coming and going. Not caring cause they don't own the place. Sally, I mean, Ms. Raye is just too nice... rents rooms to just anyone." Ralph strung together more words than he ever had in this lifetime. </p>
		<p>Accepting his explanation for the time being, Ted marched past the handyman. "Ralph, I'll see ya around." </p>

		<p>When Lacy arrived back at the writer's cabin, she found the breakfast dishes were clean and Gage and the kids lounging in the living room watching a movie on the television. Ted deposited her bags on the porch before he drove off. Unhappy that Lacy was staying with the writer, he decided to take his leave without further investing time in what he now considered a lost cause. The deputy wanted to get to know the television star a little better.
			<i>Maybe next time.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Upon seeing her mother enter the cabin, Dani jumped up. "Can we go to the cave now?"</p>
		<p>Gage intercepted the question, sensing that Lacy was a bit on edge. "I thought we'd go to town and get a few things. Like food, for instance."</p>
		<p>Lacy nodded absent-mindedly then quickly turned off the television set. She continued to stare at the blank screen.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Dani, why don't you and Derek go get cleaned up before we go to town?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>With pursed lips, Dani shrugged yet went along with the request. "Come on." She grabbed her brother's hand.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Gage called after her. "We'll get some ice cream, okay?"</p>
		<p>The bright smile that flashed across Derek's face mirrored that of his sister. "I like ice scream." Derek said sincerely to his sister being scooted him down the hallway in front of her.</p>
		<p>The writer turned her attention to the distraught Lacy. "What's wrong?" Gage walked with Lacy to the couch.</p>
		<p>"It's nothing really." The smile she displayed didn't reach her eyes. "Did you know Mrs. Raye has a handyman?"</p>
		<p>"Ralph?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. He's...."</p>
		<p>"A little, no, a lot weird." Gage supplied. "Was he there?"</p>
		<p>"He came when we were about ready to leave. He was there to fix the door."</p>
		<p>"Did he say something to you?" Gage asked, realizing that his appearance had upset the star.</p>
		<p>"It wasn't what he said, it was the way he looked at me. Like he didn't like me or... I don't know." Lacy shook her head. "It just unnerved me a bit."</p>
		<p>Wrapping her arms around Lacy in comfort, Gage said. "Hey, I understand completely. He's got that one eye that darts off in one direction while the other one looks like its making circular motions." Gage tried to mimic the movement in an attempt to lighten the mood.</p>
		<p>The brevity of the moment took root and Lacy let her uneasy feelings about the handyman fade as Gage created an entirely different picture of a wild eyed Ralph in her mind. With that silly picture floating in her brain, the feeling of danger she experienced about the handyman disappeared. "You're right. Come on." Lacy stood up. "Help me with the bags."</p>
		<p>Gage followed closely, feeling something else was bothering the actress. "Did anything come up missing?"</p>
		<p>With two bags in hand, Lacy passed the writer as she re-entered the cabin. "A broach my grandmother gave me and... some underwear." Lacy mumbled the last part.</p>
		<p>Collecting the rest of the bags, Gage stepped by inside. "Some Tupperware? Why would they take Tupperware? Don't tell me you have some..." Gage's voice took on a dramatic posture. "Gucci Tupperware. Really, Lacy, I know you're a big star and everything but...." Gage noticed a stern look on the star's face.</p>
		<p>"Not Tupperware....underwear." Lacy admitted then turned and marched to the bedroom.</p>
		<p>Opening her mouth, Gage paused briefly before she replied. "I guess we're going to town to get some food ....and underwear. Interesting combination." She said out loud.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>After buying some personal items at the town's only department store, Gage suggested getting some lunch before going to the grocery store. Lacy shook her head when Gage told everyone to get what they wanted upon their arrival at Sally's Market.</p>
		<p>Dani took her words literally, filling the cart with candy, Suzy-Qs and a couple of boxes of Captain Crunch cereal. Derek happily tried to rip open every item Dani tossed in while Lacy discreetly returned a few items to the shelves. Lacy spent a few moments perusing the few paperback books the store carried, but couldn't find the one she was looking for.</p>
		<p>When they reached the check out, Gage surveyed their overloaded cart. "I think we have room for one more item." The flippant sarcastic comment hung in the air until Derek grabbed for a toy water gun.</p>
		<p>Lacy noticed her landlord, who was also the owner of Sally's Market, was their check out clerk. "Hello Mrs. Raye. You heard about the break in I gather."</p>
		<p>Sally scanned the items. "Ralph tells me you're staying with her." Nodding toward the writer who was debating with Derek between the blue water gun and the green one.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Yes. I'd rather not take the kids back to the cabin. At least not yet." Lacy offered in way of an explanation.</p>
		<p>"You'll still have to pay for the full stay." Sally informed her tenant. "It's too late to get anyone else in there and I can't be losing money."</p>
		<p>"I believe my husband paid in advance. For the whole month. Correct?" The fact that her husband never paid in advance captured her attention only for a moment.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, he did. It's not my fault you know. People breaking in. There's some crazy people come up here in the summer. We get all kinds." Sally shot a disapproving look at Gage. Sally broadcast the news of the break in to everyone she'd come into contact with, telling them that some crazed stalker must have followed the television star and is now threatening the community. Sally always did have a way of embellishing things. It was her way.</p>
		<p>Lacy couldn't help but notice Sally's dislike for Gage.
			<i>I wonder what that's all about.</i> "Keep the money."
		</p>
		<p>"So you won't be wanting the cabin for the rest of your stay?" Sally hoped she could get another renter in for the rest of the month thus getting double rent for the cabin.</p>
		<p>"That's correct." Lacy informed her, having decided she didn't want to deal with Sally anymore.</p>
		<p>Sally quickly finished scanning the purchases including the last minute toy Gage tossed on the counter.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>With the Jeep loaded up, on their way out of town, Gage pulled her car in front of the hardware store. "I've got to pick up a piece of screen for the door. Be back in a minute."</p>
		<p>Waiting patiently for Gage to return, Derek played with his new toy gun and Dani flipped through the magazine she picked out at the store while Lacy noticed Ralph exit the hardware store. He stopped abruptly upon seeing the television star. Scratched his week old whiskers, before deciding to approach the Jeep.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy checked the door's locks and squeezed the window shut tightly. Her heartbeat began to race with each step he took toward the Jeep. A deep sigh of relief fanned through her when she saw Gage whip around the handyman and jump into the Jeep.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Tossing the roll of screen in the seat behind her, Gage noticed a few beads of sweat hanging precariously from Lacy's forehead then noticed the old man standing a few feet from the Jeep staring at them. "You okay?"</p>
		<p>"No. Yes. Could we just leave please?" Lacy faced straight ahead.</p>
		<p>Gage ignited the engine and gunned the Jeep onward, away from the staring man. A quick look around the car to each of the occupants, Gage observed Lacy relax a bit while Dani stared back at the man intently.</p>
		<p>Dani's sixth sense kicked in. "I don't like him."
			<i>He's danger. I can sense it.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>It was a long ride home with little more said.</p>
