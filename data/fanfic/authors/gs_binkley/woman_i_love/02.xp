		<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent around the cabin with each occupant quietly lost in his or her own thoughts. Derek was the only one oblivious to any of the unsettling events of late.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>It was with great reluctance that they readied for bed except for Dani who jumped at the first mention of bedtime. She rushed off to the bathroom to change without the usual prompting by her mother. Derek hung sleepily to his mother after she readied him for bed. Not having seen her daughter return from the bathroom, Lacy went in search for her.</p>
		<p>After checking the windows and doors, Gage ambled down the hallway practically running into Lacy, having just rushed out of the bathroom, still holding Derek. "Have you seen Dani? She's not in here."</p>
		<p>Panic rose as Gage raced through the cabin finding no trace of the missing child. Lacy tried to remain calm. Gage rejoined Lacy back in the hallway. "I couldn't find her anywhere. The only place I haven't looked..." Sharply turning around, Gage swept through the master bedroom doorway with Lacy right behind only to find Dani planted in the center of the bed.</p>
		<p>"What took you so long?" Dani asked innocently.</p>
		<p>"What are you doing in here?" The frightened mother asked sharper than she intended.</p>
		<p>"Gage is going to tell us the story of the Shanglon Master and the woman he loved." She stared inquisitively at them. "Right?"</p>
		<p>"Right." Gage looked at Lacy. "I did promise."</p>
		<p>Derek quickly fell from his sleepy haze at the mention of a story. "Story, yea!" He bounced in his mother's arms directing her to the bed.</p>
		<p>Lacy caved. "Which side do you sleep on?" She asked, moving toward the huge bed.</p>
		<p>Noticing for the first time the pristine white v-neck tee shirt Lacy was wearing, barely covering the top of her thighs, Gage was like a deer caught in a car's headlights.
			<i>Whichever side you do.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			"Gage?" Lacy waited patiently for a reply.
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Buried under the covers, Gage continued. "It was a day of great celebration in the land of Shang. The Shanglon Master, Geoffrey Saint Brandon, had led his kingdom in peace for many years now. Once a hard and demanding emperor the Shanglon Master had been tamed by the love of a beautiful dark haired maiden named Mecca. Today, Geoff was to announce the celebration of their impending marriage. </p>
		<p>"His personal free-thinking computer, Quint, had allowed Geoff to sleep longer than he wanted causing him to be late as he wanted extra time to prepare for this special day. When Geoff asked why Quint had let him over sleep, Quint simply replied that the Shanglon Master needed the extra sleep. Geoff was aggravated that his computer tried to run his life so he demanded that Quint transfer him to, Edifice, the main building."</p>
		<p>"That can't happen." Dani corrected Gage.</p>
		<p>"Well, yes, it can in this story. You see, this story takes place many years from now and technology is very advanced." Gage offered, then continued, as Derek listened intently with his two little hands propping up his chin. "Anyway the people of the land loved Mecca just as much as the Master for she alone had brought light to his dark heart. Mecca touched his soul with unconditional love. It was this love that swayed his dangerous nature to see beyond his own dreams of conquering the world for his own pleasure, bending it to his will. With that love she changed his life and the lives of his people. Of course, Quint was the first to see the depth of the love Mecca had for his Master. He was a bit of a matchmaker which thoroughly annoyed Geoff and the fact that Quint liked to buzz around through the air like a busy bee." Gage made a buzzing noise. "But in the end, Geoff could not deny the feelings he had for the woman he loved."</p>
		<p>"Jage, I like Tent." Derek interrupted the story.</p>
		<p>"Tent?" Gage asked. Derek giggled.</p>
		<p>"He means Quint. Derek has trouble saying some words." Lacy explained. Her son's speech difficulty was a main source of the problems between father and son. It was also the reason Derek didn't talk much.</p>
		<p>"Anyway, everything was going according to plan that day. The celebration was just about to begin when........" Gage paused for dramatic effect. "Enter the evil Robida." (Row-bee-dah)</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>On edge, Dani waited with baited breath. "Well, what happened next?"</p>
		<p>Looking at a sleepy eyed Derek, Gage said. "To be continued."</p>
		<p>Shoulders slumped temporarily until an idea ran through her head.
			<i>That means we get to sleep in here again.
			</i>"Cool." Dani plopped down next to her mother and fell asleep.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Surprised at her daughter's quick surrender, Lacy gathered Derek closer to her. "That's a first. But I'm not complaining."
			<i>I guess we really should go back to our bedroom. </i>Lacy turned to Gage, studying her features.
			<i>She's not complaining.
			</i> Giving in to her desires, Lacy decided to stay put. "Gage, thanks for everything."
		</p>
		<p>A smile swept across her face as Gage thought,
			<i>My pleasure.</i>
		</p>
		<p>As they did the night before, when sleep found a home in both, they gravitated to each other, comforted in the closeness.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Ten">
		<p>The chilly air outside kept the group inside most of the morning so Gage Ballant took the time to replace the torn screen in the door. As usual, her shadow decided to help.</p>
		<p>Gage tore the old screen out and tossed it in the trash. Holding the new screen up against the door, she searched for the screen tool only to find Derek rolling it across the floor. "Derek, hand me that, okay?" </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Vrrroom." Powered by his hand, the tool rolled faster around an invisible racetrack.</p>
		<p>Watching the shy boy come out of his shell momentarily as he zoomed the screen tool faster and faster, Gage encouraged him. "That's it, Derek. You're out in the lead. You can make that turn, just once more around and you've..." </p>
		<p>Derek scooted along behind his pretend racecar, redirecting it; he headed straight for Gage shoving the screen tool racecar between her legs. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"...crossed the finish line. And we have a new winner, Derek Levine. Yeah!" Gage said excitedly.</p>
		<p>Derek threw up his hands in victory, giving the writer the opportunity she needed to grab the tool. "Yea, I win."</p>
		<p>"Yes you do." Gage pushed the tool along the screen's edges, tucking it securely in the door. When she was finished, Gage lifted the three-year-old high in the air, taking him on a victory lap.</p>
		<p>Dani watched silently as Gage played with Derek. She decided to read her magazine after being disappointed that their exploration of the cave had been delayed due to weather. </p>
		<p>"Lunch is ready." Lacy yelled.</p>
		<p>Tucking her young charge under her arm, Gage flew across the room. Excited, Derek hollered. "Fly plane. Fly like plane." With a safe landing on the kitchen chair, Gage settled next to Derek.</p>
		<p>Dani moseyed to the table, dropping her magazine on the table; she took a seat next to her mother. She watched Derek roll his make believe racecar along the table garnishing Gage's full attention. The young girl noticed both of them were completely oblivious to her presence.</p>
		<p>Lacy observed her usually boisterous daughter silently watch the playful interaction between her son and the writer.
			<i>I think my little &#145;always center of attention stage star' is jealous. </i>
		</p>
		<i>
			<pspace/>
		</i>
		<p>
			After a relatively quiet meal, Gage suggested a trip outside since the afternoon sun burned down, warming the air. "What'd you say we go play outside? Check things out."
		</p>
		<p>"What about going to the cave?" The frown frozen in place throughout lunch hadn't thawed.</p>
		<p>"Dani, it's kinda late and I don't think we'd have enough time today." Gage offered. Earlier Lacy had explained her unwillingness for Dani to explore the cave. Lacy knew from her own experience how dangerous caves could be and the fact that Dani seemed obsessed with it chased her reluctance to explore the cavern into a full-blown fear. </p>
		<p>The young girl grabbed her magazine and retreated to the couch without a word.</p>
		<p>Gage threw a questioning look at Lacy. "She's just disappointed. She'll be okay." Lacy gathered the plates, depositing them in the sink.</p>
		<p>"Here, let me help." Jumping up, Gage collected the rest of the plates. Placing them in the sink, she turned back to help Derek down. He ran to the couch, raising his hands to his sister for help up on the couch. "I think he likes that tool better than the toy gun he got yesterday at the store."</p>
		<p>Lacy smiled. Listening to her daughter read to Derek, she turned back to Gage. "I don't really need help with these. There's not that much." Lacy dipped her hands in the hot dishwater, scrubbing one of the plates.</p>
		<p>Gage searched for and retrieved a dishtowel. Rising a glass, she toweled it dry. "I don't mind. Besides...." She stopped short.</p>
		<p>Curious, Lacy asked. "What?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing." Gage shifted her eyes away quickly.</p>
		<p>With soap bubbles on her hands, she cocked them on her hips. "Well, what is it?"</p>
		<p>Knowing she was in deep trouble, Gage let her thought spill out. "I never saw a big television star.... washing dishes." Pinned by an arched eyebrow, Gage rambled on. "On TV sure but not... you know. At least not in person." Scrambled for another plate, she quickly gave it a thorough drying, concentrating on every last bit of moisture attached to it.</p>
		<p>Returning to the soaking dishes, Lacy found another one to scrub. "Just because I have a very public job....." She sighed briefly at the lofty ideas most people had about actors. "I'm just a regular person."</p>
		<p>"Are you?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>Lacy, drying her hands on the apron surrounding her small waist, gazed intently into the writer's sincere green eyes. "Yes. With feelings like everyone else."</p>
		<p>A contemplative moment stilled in time as a mixture of emotions ricocheted between them. Both shared the same thought simultaneously,
			<i>I wonder what you're feeling. </i>
		</p>
		<p>The spell broke when Derek tugged at Gage's khaki shorts. "Jage, Dani don't read no more."</p>
		<p>"Why don't you take Derek outside? He doesn't like to be cooped up too long." Lacy suggested.</p>
		<p>Tossing the dishtowel down, she nodded in agreement. "Come on, little guy." Swooping him up in her arms, Gage looked at the young girl on the couch. "Dani?" Gage jerked her head toward the door.</p>
		<p>Dani ignored her completely.</p>
		<p>Gage shrugged toward Lacy then lobbed Derek up in the air. "Guess it's just you and me."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Bouncing down the porch steps, the writer let Derek down. They walked the short distance to the shore, taking in all the boating activities on the lake. Several boats pulled skiers around as the sun shone brightly down offering sparkling light glitters to cast off the water. Derek reached down and picked up a small shell. Offering it to Gage, he said. "Sssell."</p>
		<p>Gage kneeled down next to him, smiling. "Shell."</p>
		<p>"Sssell." He repeated.</p>
		<p>Squeezing the sides of his mouth together, she repeated. "Shh...ell."</p>
		<p>He spit out the word correctly. "Shhhell."</p>
		<p>"Excellent. Shell."</p>
		<p>"Shell." Derek smiled as he mimicked her.</p>
		<p>"Okay, how bout....Quint."</p>
		<p>Again, Gage helped Derek form his lips in order to produce the correct pronunciation. "Kkent." Derek said.</p>
		<p>"Closer then tent." Encouraging him further, puckering her own lips to pronounce the word. "Qu....int."</p>
		<p>Slowly, with Gage's help, Derek sounded the word out. "Koo...Koo...Qu...ent."</p>
		<p>"Okay, now faster. You can do it."</p>
		<p>"Qu...ent."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Yes." Gage jacked her arm in victory.</p>
		<p>Mimicking his hero, Derek agreed. "Yes." With a sharp wave of his arm, he laughed so hard he fell flat on his bottom into the wet muddy sand.</p>
		<p>Gage plopped down next to him, laughing. She landed flat on her back when Derek decided to pounce on her. "Hey." A glob of mud fell on her face when the young boy waved her arm above her.</p>
		<p>They could have salvaged their slightly muddy clothes and not faced the wrath of the mother that waited inside the cabin had it not been for the ski boat that decided just then to whip around the cove hurling a huge wave directly at them. Water splashed around them as they rolled in the mud, every inch of their clothes wet and muddy. The sudden conclave of chilled water spurred a mighty yelp from both mud-covered bodies.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Finishing the dishes, Lacy took a seat next to her silent daughter. "What's up?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing." Dani absently flipped through her magazine.</p>
		<p>"Nothing, huh? You sure are saying a lot of nothing for nothing to be wrong. You and I both know that's not you're usual modus operandi."</p>
		<p>"You mean it's not my style." Dani offered her mother a mock glare at her mother's use of the big word, thinking she wouldn't know the meaning. "I am almost nine, you know."</p>
		<p>"Quite right. So, are you going to tell me why you were rude to Gage?"</p>
		<p>Lacy curled her arm around her daughter. "She's been nothing but nice to all of us. She let you drive her boat and do I have to remind you about the story she told you last night."</p>
		<p>"To be continued." Dani offered as a way of deflecting that particular nicety. "She hasn't taken me to the cave."</p>
		<p>"What is it with you and that cave? Honey, I know you love exploring, but even for you this is a bit much. It's like you've become obsessed with it."</p>
		<p>Dani deliberated her mother's words. She finally voiced her inner thoughts. "There's something about that cave that.... it's like it holds a secret or something. I don't know. I get this weird feeling about it. And, what if Gage is trying to keep me from finding out....whatever it is." Her eyes scrunched at that mysterious implication.</p>
		<p>Always respectful of her daughter's peculiar insight, Lacy decided this time Dani's feelings might stem from something else. "Are you sure you're not jealous of the bond Gage has with Derek?"</p>
		<p>Before she could retort her mother's question, a shriek raged through the house. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Dani and Lacy ran over the small ridge toward the water's edge. Slightly out of breath, they came to rest just short of where the grass met the muddy shore only to find two familiar figures. Covered in mud from head to toe, two sets of eyes popped up staring at them. The &#145;we're in trouble now' expression that adorned both Gage and Derek's dirty faces started a wave of amusement that crested into a hearty laugh from Dani and her mother.</p>
		<p>Derek's only reaction was to hold up a tiny object in his hand and proudly said. "Shell."</p>
		<p>Lacy delicately lifted her son in her arms. "Come on, honey. Let me help you." Scanning her son all over, she shook her head. "You definitely need a bath." The dark haired women threw Gage a disapproving look that warmed into a smile. "You both do."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Yeah, but he gets you to help him with his bath. Wish you were going to help me.</i>
		</p>
		<p>As if she read her mind, Gage's face brightened when Lacy suggested. "You'll need some help, too." Lacy gawked at Gage, but said to her daughter. "Dani."</p>
		<p>Gage's  wicked grin took a nosedive as Dani perked up. "I'll get the hose."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>A few hours later, well fed and dry, Gage carried Derek to bed followed by Lacy and Dani. After Lacy informed her that Dani had been jealous of the bond she shared with Derek, Gage altered the original version of the Shanglon Master story to include a cave. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"The evil Robida had kidnapped the beloved maiden, Mecca, and hid her in one of the nearby ancient caves." Gage took a moment to glance at the young girl who retained her neutral expression, but was obviously following the story closely. "The whole land was up in rage especially our hero, Geoff, the Shanglon Master. Along with his free thinking computer, Quint."</p>
		<p>"Quint." Derek echoed.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Yes, Quint. Geoff and a few of his fighting elite scoured the land. Two days had come and gone and no sign of Mecca. With Geoff fraught with anger and deep despair, Quint suggested he use his astral mental powers to connect with his love."</p>
		<p>"Can they go through the cave walls?" Dani astutely asked.</p>
		<p>"What are astral mental powers?" Lacy challenged.</p>
		<p>Gage tossed Lacy a &#145;why don't you just go along with the story like your daughter' look then addressed Dani. "Yes, they can due to the soul connection they have for each other. Only true soul mates are able to transmit these powerful rays through anything." Gage spared a quick glimpse to Lacy, seeing a flicker of recognition in her blue eyes. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I thought as much." Dani pondered the notion while Lacy spared a doubtful look to Gage.</p>
		<p>The storyteller noticed Derek trying to chase away his closing eyelids without much success and decided to conclude part two. "Anyway, Geoff connected with his love and felt an overwhelming damp, cold sensation surrounded by darkness. With this knowledge, Quint sent a scan out blanketing the countryside with his extra sensory terrain transmission. When Quint mentioned the ancient caves, Geoff dashed out the door before his computer could stop him. Suddenly reappearing, Geoff ordered Quint to transport him to the cave's entrance." Gage paused, wanting to end the story for night. </p>
		<p>"I hope this isn't the kind of story where Mecca has to have a man to save her. Is it?" All the while, Dani had decided in her mind that she was Mecca and knew, without a doubt that if she were stuck in a cave, she'd surely find a way out without any help. Years of watching her mother's cop show, Dani learned to differentiate between a helpless female and a strong one. Dani fancied herself after Samantha Gordon, the character her mother played was strong willed and independent.</p>
		<p>"Well, no, not really." Gage quickly countered. "But she does have some help from Geoff. That's okay, right?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, why not?" Dani capitulated. "You did make him the hero of the story." Dani twisted around, pulling the covers up tightly. As sleep claimed her, Dani allowed her creative mind to soar deep inside the cave searching for ways Mecca could escape.</p>
		<p>"She's a hard sell." Gage sighed, not feeling she'd made any progress in her attempt to reconnect with the young girl.</p>
		<p>Instinctively, Lacy moved closer. "She's fine. And she really likes the story, you know. Adding the cave was brilliant."</p>
		<p>"I'm not so sure. She had too much fun hosing me off earlier." Gage pinned Lacy with an adamant look. "I mean it, she was brutal. Having way too much fun at my expense. As a matter of fact, you did, too."</p>
		<p>"You have to admit it was funny." The grin on her face would not let up. "You finally got all the mud out, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm. With no help from you."</p>
		<p>"All you had to do was ask." Lacy said innocently.</p>
		<p>Green eyes nearly skyrocketed out of her head.
			<i>Ask! I would have begged. </i> Gage glanced at Lacy as she rested her head softly on the pillow close by. An innocent look remained on her beautiful features causing Gage to shake her head in self-reproach.
			<i>What I'm I doing? She hasn't done one thing or gave one iota of a sign that she would ever be interested in me. Get a grip, Ballant. And I don't even want to think about the fact that she's married.</i>
		</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eleven">
		<p>The next morning the foursome spent a few hours hunting for rocks along the shoreline and surrounding area. Dani never mentioned the cave once. Happily, ensconced in one of her favorite pastimes, which she begrudgingly, admitted she shared with Gage.
			<i>I guess I should cut her a little slack. Anyone who can get as excited as I do about collecting rocks must be okay. And she did let me drive the boat. But....I won't mention the cave. I won't mention the cave. </i> Dani repeated as she continued her search alongside her new rock-hunting partner.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy distracted Derek allowing her daughter time to re-establish a connection with Gage. Dani was not used to competition from anyone even her brother, Derek, when it came to people she decided was worthy of her attention. It wasn't that Dani thought she was better than others, it was just that her natural gregarious disposition left her the center of attention that fit her like a glove and she usually wore it well. </p>
		<p>Lacy deduced that Dani wasn't so much jealous that Gage was closer to Derek then she was to Dani, but that outside of herself and Dani, Derek remained aloft to everyone else. For some reason, the fact that Derek had suddenly and unexpectedly expanded his realm of acceptance to include Gage was a mystery.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The rock hunt concluded when a deluge hit forcing them to the safety of the cabin where they had lunch and exchanged wet clothes for dry. The long, tiring morning induced the children into an afternoon nap.</p>
		<p>Lacy and Gage were enjoying a quiet moment, sipping hot chocolate. "Sorry bout that movie the other day." Gage had been waiting for the opportunity to present itself and apology to Lacy, having realized that watching it had disturbed her.</p>
		<p>"There's no need. It brought back some unwelcome memories." When Lacy returned with the deputy to find Gage and the kids watching a movie she had starred in, the reminiscences shook her. The surrounding events in making the movie caused her pain. It took her a minute to recognize the movie playing was the first one she has starred in, releasing a flood of hurtful recollections. "I made that movie around the time Jason and I, he was my first husband, decided to get a divorce. David produced it. It was my first real break."</p>
		<p>"Hey, you don't have to explain." Gage felt bad at being the catalyst for the sad memories Lacy was now re-experiencing. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy drew her long legs up underneath her, surprised to find she did want to talk about her failed marriage. "We were, would you believe, high school sweethearts. Anyway, Jason and I got married after I found out I was pregnant. He quit college, got a job in construction and I was going to forego my dream of an acting career to have a family."</p>
		<p>"You have another child?"</p>
		<p>"No, we.... I lost the baby." A sad reflection dawned before she continued. "After that, I was determined to forge head on in my career and demanded that we move to Hollywood. Jason gave in easily, giving up his plans of starting a construction company. He finally did, start a construction company, that is.... with my brother as a matter of fact. I got lost in the work while Jason just got lost. He didn't like anything about Hollywood. Eventually, I auditioned for David and got the part. My career was steadily building and my marriage was crumbling. That's when Jason gave me an ultimatum... my career or my marriage. Can you guess which one I chose?"</p>
		<p>"Lacy." Gage covered Lacy's hand, squeezing it in understanding. "Everything happens for a reason."</p>
		<p>"I realized that later. And I wouldn't have the two most precious joys of my life if I had chosen differently." A genuine smile escaped past the sad memories. "Jason and I were together almost three years and I can honestly say most of it was great. Although, we were more friends than...." She trailed off letting silence fill in the blank.</p>
		<p>"At least you had friends." The unexpected words spilled out.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"What do you mean? Surely, you have friends and what about family?" Lacy reasoned.</p>
		<p>Having opened the floodgates, Gage decided to share some of her history as Lacy had entrusted with her. "I really only have one friend, Mark Calico. He's my partner, too. But, I don't have any family."</p>
		<p>"You have a mother though. You said she gave you your name, right?" Confusion played for a moment in Lacy's mind.</p>
		<p>"She did. But, I never knew her."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I don't understand."</p>
		<p>"She gave me up for adoption. It was some kind of deal she made that I would be named Gage." Forestalling Lacy from the expected question. "I don't know if it was a family name or what." Gage laughed. "Maybe Dani was right. She didn't like me that's why she gave it to me."</p>
		<p>"Gage!" Lacy reached up and lightly touched her cheek. "I like your name."</p>
		<p>A shy smile slowly rose. "There were times I thought about trying to find her.... I never got around to it. So, I figured it wasn't really that important to me."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Somehow to Lacy that statement didn't ring true. "I hope you do... one day."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, maybe." Gage offered a hollow agreement. "Mark's the only one I got that's family. Oh, and his grandfather. They're the only family I need." When Gage looked up to meet Lacy's warm blue eyes all of a sudden Mark and his grandfather were no longer enough. She wanted more. Needed more.</p>
		<p>Lacy's mind jealously lingered a long moment on the relationship Gage shared with her friend, Mark Calico.
			<i>Partner? What does she mean by partner? </i>But it was the hint of something more that flickered in Gage's green eyes that offered hope to Lacy that the writer would welcome and, yes, even come to need the friendship Lacy found she desperately craved to share with Gage.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>The rainy day kept them inside and after dinner, they settled in for an evening of games. Dani immediately chose her mother as her partner since she did not like to lose. And as much as she loved her brother, Dani figured Derek wouldn't be much help as they played her favorite game.</p>
		<p>Gage sitting on the floor with legs crossed, Derek plopped down on her lap, settling in as his sister geared up ready to give her mother the first clue. Gage had provided her with a movie title.</p>
		<p>Dani offered her first clue to which her mother responded. "Three words, first word &#145;the'."</p>
		<p>Nodding her head, Dani proceeded to the next word. She finally got her partner to answer &#145;little' after Lacy listed several other possibilities to include small, short and tiny. It was on the third word of the movie title that Dani used her creative abilities. She ran into the bedroom then hurried back, fell to the floor and stuck her legs into a pillowcase. Lying on the floor, Dani pretended to swim. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"The Little Mermaid." Lacy answered causing Dani to jump up, legs still wrapped in the pillowcase, and hop around at having her partner correctly decipher the clues.</p>
		<p>After several more volleys back and for between the teams, Dani was upset that her brother's team was ahead in points. She couldn't believe it. So, she suggested the movie title, The Poseidon Adventure, which Lacy shoot down and provided another one of her own for the other team to guess. </p>
		<p>Lacy helped her son, giving him a small bowl of water so he could give the clue to his partner. Derek carefully carried the bowl from the kitchen to the living room area. His mother whispered in his ear.</p>
		<p>"Hey, don't help him. Gage has to get it on her own." Not liking to be behind in points, Dani ordered her partner.</p>
		<p>Happily, Derek slapped his hand in the water again and again, spraying it all over his partner.</p>
		<p>Wiping the flinging water from her face, Gage hurriedly yelled. "Splash. The movie's Splash." But her answer didn't stop the deluge from raining down. Throwing a mock angry look at Lacy who backed up quickly, Gage then jumped up, grabbing her partner in her arms after she whisked the empty bowl from him. "Okay, that's enough, partner. We got the points." After she returned the bowl to the kitchen, Gage and Derek rejoined the opposing team. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Our turn." Dani stood, anxiously waiting to get the title of the next movie from Gage. </p>
		<p>"Dani, it's my turn to give the clue." Lacy leaned down next to Gage as Dani reluctantly sat back down.</p>
		<p>Dani waited eagerly. They had one last chance to forge ahead in the points and win the game if only her mother would cooperate. According to Dani, Lacy had provided the other team with too many easy movie titles and her team had seriously dropped behind in points after an early start out of the gate. The young girl scrunched her face seriously awaiting her first clue.</p>
		<p>Dani was quick to deduce the movie title had two words and the first word was &#145;sling' after her mother slung her arms back and forth. Now, Lacy was diligently making a yanking motion from her side then waving her arm around in the air. Panic glared on Dani's face, not having a clue as to what her mother was demonstrating. "Wave?" Lacy shook her head. "Are you making some kind of sign?"</p>
		<p>Lacy rolled her eyes, then quickly started making jabbing motions in the air.</p>
		<p>"Sword. You've got a sword." A smile tickled her face in expected triumph. "Two words and the first word is sling. Sword, sling sword?"</p>
		<p>Lacy then ran her finger along an invisible sword pretending to cut it.</p>
		<p>"Blade. Sling Blade?" Dani quizzed then watched her mother jump in elation. Bolting up, she joined her partner. After a few moments participating in a shared victory dance, Dani approached the lead member of the opposing team. "Pretty good, huh? Especially since I've never even seen a movie called &#145;Sling Blade'."</p>
		<p>A short while later, a very tired young boy laid in his mother's arms. "Guess it's time for bed, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Good. Now we get to hear the end of the story and find out how Mecca gets out of that cave...." She eyed Gage carefully, before she continued. "With a little help from the Shanglon Master."</p>
		<p>"Honey, Derek's asleep. Maybe tomorrow night." Lacy offered.</p>
		<p>"But...." She turned to Gage.</p>
		<p>"No story tonight." Gage simply stated, then added after a prominent pout appeared on the disappointed girl's face. "Would you want me to finish telling the story to Derek if you were sleeping?"</p>
		<p>"No." Dani admitted. "But we still get to sleep in the big bed, right?" Even without her nightly dose of storytelling, Dani enjoyed the closeness the four of them shared sleeping in the same bed. It gave her a sense of being together as a family something she'd missed in the last several years with both her parents always working. But her hopeful mood dashed when her mother spoke.</p>
		<p>"We really should stay in our own room tonight, I guess." She spoke the words half-heartedly, hoping her suggestion would fall on deaf ears.</p>
		<p>Misunderstanding Lacy's concern about intruding further on the hospitality offered, Gage loathed to agree. "Sure. I guess, well, whatever."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>A rush of disappointment ran through both mother and daughter. Lacy grabbed her daughter's hand and carried her son into their room when Gage shuffled off silently.</p>
		<p>After Lacy secured the children in bed, she heard a small knock at the door. "Come in."</p>
		<p>Gage offered a couple of blankets. "It's chilly out tonight. That rain brought in a cold front, I guess." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Taking the blankets, Lacy thanked her. A deafening silence fell as they stood still both waiting, hoping for the other to propose a way to move back the hands of time and lead them into the direction they both desired. Each momentarily contemplated the last three nights when they had all sleep together, safe, secure and at peace.</p>
		<p>Clearing her throat, Gage broke the silence. "If you need anything, anything at all, I'll be..."</p>
		<p>"Right down the hall." Lacy smiled at her.</p>
		<p>"Yeah."</p>
		<p>Both retreated into their own respective bedrooms, unhappy with the turn of events.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Gage wrapped herself in the covers, twisting and turning trying to find a comfortable position to sleep. It was funny, all her life she'd slept alone, but in the course of three nights, for the first time, Gage felt lonely. She missed the warm bodies crowded around her that somehow provided a calming comfort, lulling her to sleep.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>She was still awake when the small knock at the door came. "Yes." Seeing Lacy enter with both her children, a smile jumped onto her face and refused to go away. Silently, she prayed neither would her new friends.</p>
		<p>"The heater must be out in our bedroom. It's pretty cold in there." Lacy explained.</p>
		<p>Jumping out of bed, Gage raced toward them. "Okay, I'll see if I can fix it." </p>
		<p>Stopping the writer from leaving the room, Lacy suggested. "I thought maybe we could, you know, spend the night in here. Then tomorrow you could find the problem."</p>
		<p>Seizing the unexpected opportunity, Gage hastily agreed.  "Yeah, that's a better idea. Come on." Gage took Derek from Lacy and headed to bed.</p>
		<p>Once they were all snuggled down, Gage whispered. "Yeah, this is definitely a better idea. Glad you came up with it."</p>
		<p>"Me too." Content Lacy fell asleep.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twelve">
		<p>Late the next morning after breakfast while Lacy cleaned the kitchen, Dani helped Gage fix the heater problem.</p>
		<p>"We going to the cave today?" Dani asked hopefully, doing everything she could to get on the writer's good side.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. Thought we'd go out on the lake and check it out again." Gage answered, cognizant of Lacy's reluctance to allow her daughter to explore it.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The idea didn't suit Dani entirely, but driving the boat again appealed to her so she figured she'd let Gage off the hook again.
			<i>But I will get to the bottom of this and explore that cave.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Twisting a new fuse in the electrical box, Gage declared. "There. That should do it."</p>
		<p>"It's fixed now, huh?" Dani asked.</p>
		<p>"Should be. This place is heated by electric and the fuse was bad."</p>
		<p>"That means tonight the bedroom will have heat." Dani stated, lost in her own thoughts. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Dani's words raised their ugly head, reminding Gage of the fact that fixing the heater gave them one less excuse to share the same bed again.
			<i>Great. That was smart. Well, at least I can use the excuse of finishing my story.</i>
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>With the boat anchored just outside the cave's water entranceway, Gage and the kids swam around exploring it as Lacy soaked up the sun. The weather turned quite warm by mid-afternoon and they were making the best of it.</p>
		<p>Holding Derek next to her, Gage yelled at Dani. "Don't go in too far."</p>
		<p>Dani's voice echoed back from under the cave's ceiling then heard the expected response. "I won't."</p>
		<p>Gage wasn't too worried the cave's recess extended only about fifteen feet. That thought caused her to consider that the only person she ever had to be responsible for her whole life was herself. Now, watching the kids as they swam around in the water shed new light on what a huge responsibility laid on the shoulders of parents. It was quite an undertaking. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Green eyes darted back and forth between the two children. Both in their own ways were adventurous. Derek enjoyed floating in his lifejacket, mercilessly splashing Gage as Dani edged her way further in the cave.</p>
		<p>Several hours later, waterlogged and pruned, Gage persuaded both kids to climb back into the boat. Dani wrapped a beach towel around her and parked herself in the captain's chair while Derek decided his mother needed company and attempted to climb on her.</p>
		<p>"Ohhh..." Lacy yelped as her son touched her sunburned back. Her sudden reaction caused Derek to whimper and retreat toward Gage who was pulling up the anchor.</p>
		<p>Lacy hurried to wrap her arms around Derek. "I'm sorry, honey."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>A few tears wet his face. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>"It's okay." She kissed him lightly. "You just startled me." Looking at Gage, Lacy added. "Guess I over did it."</p>
		<p>"Here." Gage offered her a soft towel to cover her sunburned shoulders. "We'll head back and put something on that." Turning to Dani, she asked. "You ready, Captain."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>While Derek took a nap and Lacy struggled with a cold shower pelting her super sensitive skin, trying to wash off the apparently ineffectual sun tanning lotion, Dani practiced some of her rope tying skills.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy stiffly walked into the living room after her shower wearing a white v-neck tee shirt and a pair of cotton shorts. She eased herself down on the couch and squirted some lotion in her hand. Delicately applying it to her arms and upper legs, she tensed at the contact. "I should have known better."</p>
		<p>Concerned for her mother and her own plans, Dani asked. "You'll be better by the weekend, right?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I think so. Why?"</p>
		<p>"The fair's this weekend. Jeez, mom, you promised."</p>
		<p>Struggling to apply the lotion to her back, Lacy absent-mindedly agreed. "Hmmm."</p>
		<p>From the kitchen, Gage watched Lacy smooth the lotion over her long arms and legs. Dropping the unpeeled potato on the counter, Gage dashed over to where Lacy was in need of some assistance. "Here let me." Gage procured the lotion from her. "Go ahead lay on your stomach."</p>
		<p>Lacy lifted up and turned over, lying down. Gage hesitantly lifted the white tee shirt up to the top of the star's shoulders.
			<i>My God, she is beautiful. </i>The soft, supple and sexy skin screamed to her and Gage didn't resist the temptation.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy basked in the soothing feel of pliant hands gliding over her sensitive skin. She allowed her mind to drift in the pleasure she was experiencing until the insistent sound of her daughter's voice brought her abruptly back.</p>
		<p>"We are going to the fair, right?" Dani demanded an answer.</p>
		<p>Noting the tension sear through Lacy's back muscles at the question, Gage interceded. "Absolutely." Poignantly looking at the young girl. "That's a promise."</p>
		<p>After securing the guarantee and having no interest in watching her mother and Gage, Dani returned to her knot tying.</p>
		<p>Gage immediately felt the muscles under her hands relax so she lavishly continued her gentle, soothing massage. For long moments, both enjoyed the healing touch that passed between them. Stretching the enjoyable session out for as long as she could, Gage reluctantly pulled her hands away from the soft skin of the beautiful woman. "I'm done."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Readied for bed, Gage herded both kids to her bedroom and piled them up on it. "I'll be right back." She met Lacy in the hallway just outside the door.</p>
		<p>"You sure you don't mind." Lacy asked.</p>
		<p>"No, not at all. Besides, I've got to finish the story or I may not live another day." Looking the beautiful woman up and down, Gage asked. "What about you? You gonna be okay?"</p>
		<p>"I'll be fine. I guess it's really best if I sleep alone with this sunburn and all." Lacy said. "Though I hate to miss the end of the story."</p>
		<p>Gage laughed. "Well, I'll make it up to you later. Give you your own personal story time." With that pledge, both Lacy and Gage returned to their respective bedrooms.
			<i>My God, I am flirting dangerously close to the edge.</i>
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"With Quint hovering close behind, Geoff entered the cave with only a small torch and sword strapped to his side. Silently, they explored every entryway leading deeper inside the dark corridors. Geoff could sense Mecca's closeness, sending her reassurance that he was coming for her. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Mecca waited patiently for two days hoping for someone to rescue her. Feeling desolate, the evil Robida didn't help matters by taunting her, describing in detail how she was going to rot in the dungeon because her future husband wouldn't come and save her. So Mecca determined to save herself.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Just then, Quint and Geoff peeked their heads around the cave's wall, having infiltrated the interior dungeon. Watching from a distance, Geoff tried to get Mecca's attention, pitching small pebbles near her, as the evil Robida swiped a sharp blade along her delicate neck. The evil Robida noticed the flicker of her blue eyes and turned to see Geoff step out from behind a cave wall with Quint buzzing in the air behind him.</p>
		<p>"Drawing a sword, Geoff approached Robida ready for battle. While the evil Robida had diverted his attention from Mecca, she quickly scrapped the sharp rock she found on the ground against the rope tied around her hands. </p>
		<p>"Quint warned Geoff that some of Robida's henchmen were approaching from behind. Having to turn his attention to them, he had provided Mecca with the time needed to free herself. Untying the rope around her ankles, she formulated an idea as the evil Robida returned his attention to her.</p>
		<p>"Quint and Geoff were engaged in an all out battle with the twenty henchmen. As Robida descended on Mecca, she pretended to be restrained by the ropes until he edged closer and closer....."</p>
		<p>Lacy stepped inside and quietly announced. "I can't sleep."</p>
		<p>"Come on, mom. We're just getting to the good part." Looking at the storyteller for assurance. "Right?"</p>
		<p>Lacy slipped into bed next to Gage who only nodded in agreement. "Don't let me stop you. Go on." Encouraging Gage to continue.</p>
		<p>"Just as the evil Robida was about to slice Mecca's neck she leaned back, kicking him right in the....." Gage corrected herself. "Face. Stunned, he fell back temporarily losing his balance. Scooping some dirt in her hand she quickly got up. As he was about to strike again, Mecca blew the handful of dirt in his face. In his confused state, Mecca took the opportunity that presented itself.</p>
		<p>"Just as Quint and Geoff finished off the last of the henchmen they turned around ready to help free Mecca only to find she had bound the evil Robida securely with the rope that had previously held her feet. Geoff rushed to his love, wrapping her in his arms.</p>
		<p>"The next day, the celebration continued throughout the land with the formal announcement of their marriage and all were relieved to hear that the evil Robida was transported in a capsule far away into the future."</p>
		<p>Sensing the ending of the story, Dani concluded. "And they lived happily ever after." A short pause. "I knew she'd get out of it on her own."</p>
		<p>"So you liked it, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, yes, I did. Very good story there, Gage. Perhaps I'll let you tell me another." Dani yawned, closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p>
		<p>Smiling at Lacy, Gage said. "That's the highest praise I've ever gotten for one of my stories."</p>
		<p>"Me too. Jage, I like story, too." Derek supplied his input.</p>
		<p>Gage brushed her lips in a light kiss across his forehead as Lacy watched the sweet scene unfold. Derek laid his head down on her chest, closed his eyes and fell to sleep. </p>
		<p>"That was nice." Lacy stated simply. She snuggled closer as near as her sun burnt body would allow and still be comfortable, shut her eyes and fell asleep.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Thirteen">
		<p>Gage contorted her face in disgust as she slipped the slimy, wiggling worm on Derek's fishing hook. The young boy giggled. "Fishy food." </p>
		<p>"Yeah, fishy food. Yuk!" Gage spit out, dropping the line.</p>
		<p>Screwing up his face to mimic the expression Gage displayed, Derek echoed. "Yuk!" Then dropped the baited line in the water off the dock. Dropping down on the edge of the dock, settling between her legs as she sat on a lawn chair.</p>
		<p>Lacy sat next to her in a matched chair. She watched her daughter cast her line from the edge of the dock a few feet away. Dani, a serious fisherman, fished standing just in case she needed the extra leverage when she snagged a big fish while Derek enjoyed watching his cork bob up and down in the water unconcerned that a fish was nibbling on it. He'd splash the tip of his pole in and out of the water, effectively scaring them away.</p>
		<p>"You don't fish much, do you?" Lacy smirked at Gage's reluctant assistance.</p>
		<p>Wiping the slime from the worm on her blue jeans, Gage replied. "How'd you guess?" Sparing a glance to Lacy. "Not one of my skills. I guess you're an expert fisherman though."</p>
		<p>"I can hold my own. It's been a long time....too long." Thinking back, Lacy continued. "Some of the best fishing I ever did was right here on this lake. My grandparents had a cabin up here years ago." Waving her arm out across the lake. "Things have changed in the last fifteen years. Back then, there was only about a third maybe less cabins here."</p>
		<p>"Mark, my friend, has had his cabin for, gosh, I think he said forty, forty-five years. He's remodeled some. Actually, it belonged to his mother's family. Mark inherited." Gage offered.</p>
		<p>"The two of you, you're close?" Lacy hesitantly asked, intently studying Gage as she answered.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, like I said the other night.... he's family."</p>
		<p>Not getting the answer she was searching for, Lacy redirected her question. "The two of you are involved, I mean, together?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. Mark and I are partners." Gage said, dashing the star's hope that they weren't intimately involved and at the same time sparking a surge of jealousy that took Lacy by surprise.</p>
		<p>"Oh." The writer noticed the beginnings of an expressive wave of disappointment cross Lacy's face. For some reason, Gage felt the need to explain further. "We've only known each other for about a year. You see, we're business partners."</p>
		<p>"Oh?" When that expressive wave Lacy held hit the shore on her face it had turned into one of delight.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"We met after Mark read one of my stories. We both shared a dream of being in the movie making business, so with Mark's connections and financial resources and me, well, I.... just finished my second screenplay. That's why I came up here.....no distractions." Gage said. "Well, except for a little daredevil flying through the air right into my arms." Gage mussed Derek's dark hair causing him to look up and smile. "I wanted to get it done before we start pre-production on my first screenplay."</p>
		<p>"Any good parts for me?" The actor in her asked. "Seriously, I'd love to read it."</p>
		<p>"Which one?"</p>
		<p>"Both." Upon hearing her daughter squeal, Lacy turned her attention away from the writer. Watching Dani reel in her biggest catch of the day, Lacy congratulated her. "That's a big one. Maybe Gage will clean it and we'll have fish tonight."</p>
		<p>Dani tossed her latest catch into the cooler with the other three fish she'd caught. Seeing Gage shake her head in disgust, Dani smirked. "Guess we'll have to do it, mom. She can cook." Having baited the hook again, she flipped the line as far as she could. </p>
		<p>"I'll make you a deal, you clean what Derek catches and I'll help Dani clean hers."</p>
		<p>"Now, that's a deal I can't refuse." Patting his head once again, Gage encouraged Derek. "That's it. Keep splashing."</p>
		<p>"But you have to fry them." Lacy insisted. "I'll be busy." Ducking her head sideways to get Gage's full attention. "Hopefully reading?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know about that."</p>
		<p>"Come on." Lacy pleaded.</p>
		<p>Throwing her a doubtful look, Gage said. "What kind of stories do you like to read?"</p>
		<p>"Different ones." Lacy answered. "But, there's a new author that I've been reading. Ballantine. The latest one just came out. I was hoping to read it while I was here. I forgot to bring the book and couldn't find a copy of it at the store the other day."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Interested by Lacy's comment, Gage light heartedly said. "I see. So you're desperate to read anything."</p>
		<p>"No. Come on, please." The writer was on the verge of giving in at her request. "What kind of stories do you write anyway?" Lacy quizzed.</p>
		<p>Before Gage completely caved and disclosed a relevant piece of information, a strong voice interrupted them. "Mrs. Levine?"</p>
		<p>Twisting around, Lacy watched the sheriff and his deputy approach. "Sheriff? Hi."</p>
		<p>Removing his hat, the sheriff nudged his young deputy who was gawking at the television star dressed in the scantly two-piece electric blue swimsuit. Waiting for Deputy Simmons to don a professional demeanor, the sheriff stated the facts. "Ma'am. We've caught the perps."</p>
		<p>Flashing a white smile, the deputy translated. "He means the two guys that broke into your place the other night."</p>
		<p>"Ted, I can do this by myself."
			<i>If you weren't my sister's kid, I'd have thrown you off the force. </i> The stern look he drilled into his nephew hit to the core.
			<i> I may still do that yet. </i>"Actually, it was Sally's kid, Ned, and his friend, Buddy Dunston. Sally's not going to press charges. She's piss.... upset though since she was ranting and raving that some crazy nut broke into the cabin." He smiled at that thought. "But you can, since you were the legal occupant of the dwelling at the time and it was your stuff they took."
		</p>
		<p>Ted supplied the information he found to be relevant. "We haven't recovered your under...." Realizing two children were nearby he cleared his throat. "Personal items. They both claimed they threw the items away though." </p>
		<p>"What about my broach? I don't care about the other things." Lacy asked.</p>
		<p>"We haven't recovered it. Matter of fact, they maintain they didn't take it." The sheriff said. "You want to file a complaint?"</p>
		<p>"Not unless it would help me get my broach back. It belonged to my grandmother." Lacy felt all hope was lost in finding the family heirloom.</p>
		<p>"How'd you find out it was them?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>The sheriff answered before his nephew spoke. "Loose lips. The boys, they were drinking at the time, were boasting about being in Mrs. Levine's bedroom and what kind of.... nightwear she wore."</p>
		<p>"When they described the red panties, I knew." Ted smiled.</p>
		<p>Finalizing her decision, Lacy answered. "No. I just want the matter closed."</p>
		<p>"Mrs. Levine, perhaps we could take another look through the cabin and see if it was misplaced." The young deputy offered.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, deputy." Lacy stood up, covering herself with a swim wrap. Thinking Lacy was going to head off with the deputy right then, Gage jumped up, knocking back her chair. Then Lacy added. "I may talk with Mrs. Raye about checking out the cabin later to look for the broach. If I do, Gage can go with me."</p>
		<p>Nodding, the sheriff corralled his frisky deputy and headed back to their patrol car, taking their leave. Gage, relieved by Lacy's comments, came up next to her. "You okay?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." Looking into concerned green eyes, Lacy asked. "You will go with me, won't you?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely. I'll call Sally right now if you want." Gage offered. "Come on, kids."</p>
		<p>Grabbing the writer's arm, Lacy stopped her. "Maybe I should call her. I don't think she likes you."</p>
		<p>Gage chuckled. "She doesn't."</p>
		<p>Lacy quirked an eyebrow in question.</p>
		<p>"It's Mark she really detests. You see, Sally owns all the cabins on this side of the lake except for this one. Mark refuses to sell. You wouldn't know it by looks, but she's a shrewd businesswoman. Owns the only grocery store in town and the only bar." Gage helped Derek pack up his fishing gear and motioned for Dani to join them. She reluctantly did, picking up her cooler full of fish. "You call and we'll....." Astonished that she was actually going to make the offer to undertake such a disgusting task, Gage said. "Clean the fish."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Fish cleaned, fried and eaten, Gage and Lacy debated whether they all needed to search the cabin for Lacy's broach. A compromise was reached. They walked the short distance to the cabin together. Dani took the opportunity to gather a few rocks that were definitely keepers. Derek squirmed in Gage's arms when they passed the knoll he had taken flight from. Apparently, wanting to give it another try.</p>
		<p>When they reached the cabin, Lacy handed the key she still had to Gage. The writer checked the house out first then waved the rest of her entourage in. Lacy set Derek loose after telling him what he was searching for. "Go on, Derek." He scrambled off in search of the missing item like a well-trained bloodhound. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The actress explained to Gage that while they had stayed at a hotel once, Derek, who has a natural instinct for finding things, retrieved what he described as a &#145;battery holder' from under the bed. "Suffice it to say, it was a...." Lacy scratched her forehead, then reluctantly confirmed. "A vibrator."</p>
		<p>Gage's jaw dropped, looking at the star in disbelief.</p>
		<p>"No. It wasn't mine." Lacy admonished the writer.</p>
		<p>Backtracking fast. "I didn't say anything." Gage hurried off, joining the search.</p>
		<p>The half hour search yielded nothing. So, Lacy called off her little hound dog who retrieved a lost treasure trove that included a small yo-yo, fingernail clippers and his favorite find, a loud, very loud whistle dangling from a cord. Blowing it over and over again, Lacy swiped it from his mouth. "Let me clean that first, Derek."</p>
		<p>Handing it to Gage, the writer made a closer inspection of the noisemaker, noting the slobber on it. "I think he already took care of that."</p>
		<p>Snatching it from Gage, they young girl strung it around her neck and dropped on one knee to her brother. "Derek, can I have this? It can be for my birthday."</p>
		<p>Shaking his head, Derek agreed, but not without a demand. "Blow."</p>
		<p>Like the pied piper, Dani blew the whistle loudly as she led her followers out of the cabin, down the shoreline back to Gage's place. </p>
		<pspace/>

		<hr/>

		<p>When it was time to go to bed, Lacy and the kids got ready and without prompting followed Gage down the hallway, finding their way to what had become the community bed.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>It didn't take long for the kids to curl up and find their way to sleepy town, but only after an acute discussion about when Dani was going to get to explore the cave. Lacy quickly diverted her daughter's persistent request by bringing up the county fair that was starting in a few days. Lacy knew she would finally cave in, literally, and allow her daughter to explore it, but she needed to talk with Gage about it and maybe even have her scout it out first. The vivid memory Lacy carried of her harrowing experience in the cave years ago still played havoc in her mind like a bad rerun. </p>
		<p>"With everything that happened I forgot to read your screenplay." Lacy turned toward the writer.</p>
		<p>"That was the plan."</p>
		<p>"Seriously, I'd love to read it." Lacy admitted. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Okay. But not without a price." Gage waggled her eyebrows a little more seductively than she intended.</p>
		<p>Cocking an eyebrow, Lacy played along. "And that would be?"</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Thinking quickly, Gage made her request. "Tell me about your career."</p>
		<p>Surprised by the request, and unexpectedly disappointed that Gage hadn't requested something a little more personal, she complied. "I got lucky getting a few commercials when I first arrived in Hollywood, which paid the bills for awhile until I got the part in that movie you were watching with the kids which led to my TV series that just ended."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I know all that." Gage assured her. Targeting specific questions to the answers she wanted, she continued. "Do you like it? Is it what you thought it would be? What kind of parts are you looking to do?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I really love acting. And it's mostly what I thought it would be... except for the public persona the fans have of you. You play a cop for six years and they get the impression you are that character."</p>
		<p>Gage propped herself up on her elbow. "I've watched your show. And, there are some similarities between you and your character."</p>
		<p>"You've watched the show, huh?" Lacy smiled, sitting up.</p>
		<p>Having admitted something she'd avoided up till now, Gage relented. "Yes. I said I did. And, yes, I liked it."</p>
		<p>Lacy felt privileged to hear the writer's admission. "I'll admit that as an actor you do put something of yourself in your character. I would imagine you do the same in your stories."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Gage thought about it for a minute. "I really didn't think about it. That's true, I guess."</p>
		<p>"And you'll find that people will conclude that everything you write about is about you or you had those experiences." Lacy suggested. "It's just that they get a certain impression and it's hard to live that image every day. I have good days and bad days like everyone else. But you're not allowed to be yourself."</p>
		<p>"Why not?" Gage truly didn't understand her dilemma.</p>
		<p>"Your agent, publicist, producers....everyone demands that you act the part even in your private life."
			<i>I know David demands that we put on our best faces no matter what.</i> "I realize because of my job that my private life is played out in the public arena. I just don't understand why people associate my work, whether they like it or not, to what I do in private. It shouldn't matter whether they approve of my life or not... if they like my acting then that should be enough." Lacy relaxed back down. "I'm just whining, aren't I?"
		</p>
		<p>"No." Gage insisted. "It's hard for you, isn't it?"</p>
		<p>Shaking her head. "Yes. My greatest fear is that one day my private life will come into direct conflict with my professional life and I'll have to choose one or the other."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>It happened when Lacy became pregnant with Derek. To hear David rant and rave you'd think she just committed a sin putting her hugely successful show in jeopardy. He tried forcing her in making a decision and, suffice it to say, her up and coming producer husband demanded that she choose her career. It was the one decision she staunchly refused to be swayed his way. So, in every other decision regarding her career Lacy placated her husband wishes to avoid the inevitable confrontations. Following her husband's directives and posturing a perfect public personal, Lacy went on automatic pilot.</p>
		<p>"You're extraordinarily talented, Lacy." Gage said sincerely. "I'm sure your fans would understand whatever you choose to do in your life."</p>
		<p>"They're not really the ones that concern me. It's the perception producers have about what they think the public will accept, that's the real issue."</p>
		<p>Shooting for some brevity, Gage asked. "You're not thinking of donning a covert fa&amp;ccedil;ade and sell secrets to other countries like a Mata Hari, are you?"</p>
		<p>It must have done the trick because Lacy let out a very relieved laugh, slapping Gage across the arm. "Get outta here."</p>
		<p>A definite pout bloomed on her face, protesting. "But it's my bed!" With a quick glance across the bed, seeing she was out numbers by the Levine brood, Gage conceded. "It was my bed."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Fourteen">
		<p>Luxuriating in peaceful contentment Lacy stretched languidly closer to the source of tranquility she craved. Dragging her eyes open from a deep and restful sleep, Lacy found herself draped over the writer. A slow satisfied smile crawled across her face, dropping her heavy eyelids and edged even closer. Lacy let her body and mind lounge in the wonderful feeling of being in a place where she wanted to be for the rest of her life. Her mind drifted, basking in this welcoming thought. She inhaled long and slow, breathing deeply until suddenly an alarm bell screamed in her head at the realization of the position her body was in and that this wasn't a dream.</p>
		<p>She jerked up, pushed herself back practically rolling over her daughter who had taken up residence on her left side. This abrupt movement woke the remaining sleeping occupants. </p>
		<p>Containing a surge of frantic confusion at being abruptly awoken, a startled Gage asked. "What? What is it?"</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Regaining her composure, Lacy calmly announced. "Nothing. I...must have had a bad dream." Yet, it was anything but a bad dream she grudgingly admitted.
			<i>No, not a dream. It was real. I.... felt....I can't think about this now.</i> The previous fleeting feelings toward Gage had been effectively shoved back only to resurge, bombarding her senses into overload. Lacy stubbornly refused to pursue these intimate thoughts any further. It led down a path she'd never considered before. A road wrought with the unknown and on the surface grated against what she was brought up to believe.
			<i>I'm married for God's sake.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Come on, kids." Lacy pulled Derek from the bed and nudged Dani off the mattress. "We need to get dressed." Trotting them out the door and down the hallway.</p>
		<p>Before Gage could say a word, they were gone. Confused by the star's actions, the writer stumbled out of bed herself. Mumbling, she said. "Wonder what that was all about?"</p>
		<p>Gage was fixing breakfast when Lacy and the kids emerged from the second bedroom. The kids settled themselves at the table, receiving a glass of milk from Gage. Returning to the frying bacon, Gage covertly watched Lacy collect the plates and silverware. It was apparent Lacy was edgy and avoiding Gage, slipping around her with downcast eyes.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Excuse me." Lacy shifted past Gage, averting her blue eyes.</p>
		<p>Pulling the last piece of bacon from the pan, Gage sifted some flour in it, stirring till it turned golden brown then added some milk creating a delicious gravy. "It's about ready." Turning abruptly to make the announcement, she nearly collided with Lacy who had retrieved some napkins.</p>
		<p>After a few awkward passes around each other, Gage settled down to the table while Lacy filled her children's plates. The silence was unsettling. The writer would briefly catch Lacy looking at her, only to see her turn away quickly.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy felt the compelling yearnings about Gage begging to be considered overpower her already distraught emotions when a reprieve from her daughter broke the deafening silence. "What are we gonna do today?" Dani asked hopefully.</p>
		<p>"We have to get some clothes washed this morning, clean up this place." Lacy said quickly, eyeing the living room that wasn't really dirty it just looked lived in. "And we need to....." Lacy continued, apparently starting on a long list of unappealing things to do.</p>
		<p>"I wanted to barbeque some hamburgers and hot dogs for lunch then take the boat out. What'd ya say?" Gage just as hurriedly inserted, diverting Lacy from the tasks she was listing.</p>
		<p>Finally, looking straight into the writer's concerned and questioning green eyes, Lacy acquiesced.
			<i>She hasn't done anything. I don't know why I'm taking it out on her. </i> "Actually, that sounds great."
		</p>
		<p>A bright smile flashed across Dani's face.
			<i>At least that will get me closer to the cave than staying here. </i> She jumped off her chair, helped her brother down and towed him along toward the bathroom. "We'll get ready."
		</p>
		<p>"Honey, first we've got to wash some clothes. Why don't you gather them up?" Lacy called after her impatient daughter.</p>
		<p>Dani rolled her eyes, but complied.</p>
		<p>Gage collected the plates and dropped them in the hot, soapy water. She immediately started washing them without saying a word to her silent friend. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Within a few moments, Lacy joined her, drying the washed dishes. "I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>Nonchalantly, the dishwasher asked. "What for?"</p>
		<p>"This morning." Lacy opened the cabinet door, depositing the dried glasses. "You haven't done anything and I've been rude to you."</p>
		<p>"Distant, maybe, a little aloft, but not rude." Gage corrected her. "Anything I can help with?"</p>
		<p>"I think I need to sort this out on my own." Lacy admitted.</p>
		<p>"Okay." Gage accepted. "At least let me help with the clothes. I've got a few things to wash, too, if you don't mind putting our clothes together."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Lacy let her mind travel a ways down the road she was attempting to avoid.
			<i>Putting our clothes together isn't what concerns me; it's what's under our clothes coming together that have made me dizzy, confused and...hot. </i>Waving her hand in front of her face, Lacy's mind strayed.
		</p>
		<p>"Lacy?" </p>
		<p>Whirling back from that disturbing yet intriguing wayward thought, Lacy said. "What? Oh, yeah, I think we can get together. I mean, our clothes can get... be put...."</p>
		<p>Baffled by Lacy's muddled words, Gage completed the sentence. "Washed together?"</p>
		<p>Saved by an ear-piercing noise, Derek ran from his sister, blowing her whistle loudly. "Derek, give that back to me." She cornered him then calmly reminded him. "You gave that to me for my birthday, remember?"</p>
		<p>He shook his head knowingly. But as she approached him to retrieve it, Derek dropped down between her legs, scrambled through them, heading straight for his savior of choice. "Jage. Jage. Help me."</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Having decided to take a boat ride around the lake first then barbeque, Gage started the fire in preparation of dinner. Derek, with a frown on his face, watched his sister blowing her whistle while she searched the area for rocks and four-leaf clovers. Lacy walked out to the porch with a tray of uncooked hotdogs and ground beef. She handed them to Gage. "He's still not happy."</p>
		<p>Taking in her son's frustrated disposition, Lacy had an idea. "I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>The slamming of a car door jerked Gage's attention from the barbeque grill. Her keen hearing noted the soft footfalls of someone approaching the cabin from the side of the deck. Gage observed Derek repel at the sight of the strange man as he came around the corner of the porch. Without hesitation, Gage stepped between the three year old and the stranger. "Hello. Can I help you?"</p>
		<p>The unexpected visitor remained silent, but surveyed the area, taking note of Derek who hovered behind Gage and Dani playing in the yard several feet away.</p>
		<p>"Who are you?" Gage demanded an answer.</p>
		<p>Just then, Lacy stepped out on the porch. Shocked by his presence, she said. "David! What are you doing here?"</p>
		<p>David slid up next to her, brushing a kiss on her cheek. "Don't sound so excited to see, babe." He then turned his attention to his son. "Derek, come here." He opened his arms to receive a welcome from Derek who didn't budge.</p>
		<p>Becoming aware of the confused look on Gage's face, Lacy hurried the introduction. "I'm sorry. Gage, this is.... David." </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The writer still held a questioning look. So, David leaned forward, extending his hand. "Her husband." He moved back, wrapping his arm around his wife's shoulder. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Daddy!" Dani squealed upon seeing her father. She rushed into his waiting arms. </p>
		<p>David hugged his daughter tightly. "At least someone is glad to see me." He said sarcastically, glancing from his son to his wife as she dangled the yo-yo from her hand.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Dinner mirrored the same deafening silence that breakfast had served up, but for entirely different reasons. The group was now gathered in the living room. David patiently listened to his daughter explain the details of their vacation so far, spending an inordinate amount of time telling tales of her captaining the boat and of the cave nearby.</p>
		<p>"There's a fair this weekend. And now that you're here, we can all go." She scooted up on his lap, happy at the prospect.</p>
		<p>"Yes, well,....." David shifted his gray eyes toward Lacy. "We need to talk later."</p>
		<p>Recognizing the hidden meaning behind David's request, Lacy knew there would be a change of plans about to hit the fan. This time she was staunchly going to stand her ground. They had come here for a family vacation. A well deserved vacation and she was bound and determined to keep that promise to her kids.</p>
		<p>"Gage is coming to....we're going to use her boat." Dani continued, oblivious to the subtle battle glances between husband and wife.</p>
		<p>"Honey, why don't you take Derek and get ready for bed?" Lacy suggested to her daughter.</p>
		<p>"What? It's not even dark out yet." Dani nearly shouted in protest.</p>
		<p>Sliding her off his lap, David ordered. "Go on, do as your mother says."</p>
		<p>She complied suddenly recognizing the signs that her parents were going to have another one of their disagreements.</p>
		<p>Turning his attention to Gage, David thanked her. "It was nice of you to spend some time with my family. The boat and all." He shifted slightly, coughed then continued. "If you don't mind though, it's getting late and I'd like to talk with my wife.... alone. We haven't seen each other in a week." He winked. "Well, you know what I mean."</p>
		<p>Bolting up, Gage shoved her hands in her pockets.
			<i>Yeah, I know what you mean.</i>
		</p>
		<i>
			<pspace/>
		</i>
		<p>"David!" Lacy admonished him.</p>
		<p>"That's okay. I need to make a couple of calls anyway." Gage offered.</p>
		<p>David stood up, walking away from her, but said over his shoulder. "Maybe we'll see you around tomorrow."</p>
		<p>Gage grabbed her leather satchel and cellular phone from the kitchen counter then marched toward the door. Just before reaching it, Lacy tugged at her arm, twisting her back around.</p>
		<p>"Don't go. This is your place." A quick glance back toward her husband who had grabbed his overnight bag and headed into the master bedroom, Lacy apologized. "I should have told him earlier about the break in and that we're staying here with you."</p>
		<p>Gently grasping Lacy's arm, Gage offered her a genuine smile. "It's okay. I'll sleep in the boathouse and we'll....sort it out in the morning."</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Lacy said, before Gage slipped out into the darkening night. Lacy consciously decided not to tell her husband about the break in that evening even though she had made several calls back home in attempt to reach him. Suspecting he was about to cancel their vacation, she knew he would use that to validate his change of plans. Lacy reluctantly walked into the master bedroom to find David getting ready for bed. </p>
		<p>"Is there a phone in here? I need to make some calls." David looked around, finding none. "Guess I'll use my cell phone. I've got a couple of calls to make and we need to talk about your movie with Koda."</p>
		<p>Ready for bed, the kids walked into the bedroom. Dani immediately jumped up on the bed while Derek stayed behind his mother. Slipping out of his shirt, David sternly eyed his daughter. "And just what do you think you're doing, missy."</p>
		<p>"Going to bed." Dani said straight to the point.</p>
		<p>"And since when did you start sleeping with your mom and....." David was interrupted when Lacy leaped into action before Dani could answer; she herded her children from the master bedroom to the other bedroom. </p>
		<p>Tucking her two kids in bed, Lacy kissed one then the other on their forehead. "Goodnight."</p>
		<p>"Mom?" Dani asked.</p>
		<p>"Mmmmm?" Lacy turned at the door.</p>
		<p>"Are we gonna leave?"</p>
		<p>"No." Lacy winked then added. "You be a good girl and watch your brother tonight. Okay?"</p>
		<p>Dani nodded. </p>
		<p>Lacy ambled down the short hallway to the master bedroom as if it was the longest walk of her life. This wasn't a fight she wanted to face. David had changed, ready for bed and browsing through his day planner.</p>
		<p>"Kids asleep?" He asked not hearing the answer.</p>
		<p>Lacy crossed the room, gathering her clothes and entered the bathroom to change while David punched in several numbers on his cell phone.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>A short while later, she crawled into bed as he replaced his cell phone on the night table. "I just talked to Griffen. He wants to step up the start date a couple of weeks for your movie with Koda."</p>
		<p>"That's just six weeks from now." Lacy sighed. "I promised mom we'd stop by for a visit after our vacation."</p>
		<p>"Maybe after the movie." David said absent-mindedly, scribbling in his day planner. "Ryan's stirring up a fuss about starting earlier than planned, but he'll just have to adjust. Griffen is adamant about it. My partner doesn't realize you can't bite the hand that feeds you."</p>
		<p>"That means Ryan will have to rush his latest project. What's the hurry anyway?" </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Griffen's got another movie he wants me to do.....it's with Hayston." David said nonchalantly. "And his daughter, Kathy, just got out of film school and he wants her on the project." He added as an after thought.</p>
		<p>"My co-star has a movie deal? Great. She was concerned about being stereotyped. What's the role?"</p>
		<p>"Detective."</p>
		<p>"Oh." Then her thoughts turned to a young girl she'd met several times throughout her filming of her cop show. Kathy Griffen, the movie mogul's only child. She was ambiguous and a go-getter. Lacy admired the fact that Kathy elected to attend film school before taking the standing job offer by her father to work on one of his movies. "It will be nice to see Kathy again."</p>
		<p>Without really listening to his wife's comment, David was preoccupied with Lacy's future leading man. "And it works better for Koda." David shook his head, laid his day planner down and turned his complete attention to his wife. "He's a pistol, isn't he?"</p>
		<p>A quirked eyebrow signaled him to proceed.</p>
		<p>"He's had an affair with all his leading ladies. The son of a bitch has some ego." David chuckled.</p>
		<p>"Are you worried?"</p>
		<p>"Me? Hell no." Lacy was happy to know her husband trusted her and wouldn't succumb to Koda Kannon's charming and, some say, irresistible ways. "He's got nothing on me."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Her happy mood deflated, she said softly. "I thought it was because you trusted me."</p>
		<p>Turning fully toward her, he pulled her closer. "I do trust you, babe. You've got better sense than that."</p>
		<p>"I see." But she really didn't and neither did her husband.</p>
		<p>Noticing his lovely wife's dejected expression, he offered a promise. "Listen, babe. After the movie, we'll really be able to take a long vacation. That was the original plan anyway, right?" David slid down next to his wife.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>
			<i>Plan? All my plans have been bombarded of late. </i>The seedlings of her unexpected feelings for Gage, the stress related to the break in and the subtle distance between them, eroding their relationship, that had invaded her marriage in the last few years weighed heavily on her mind. Lacy longed for the love and security her marriage once offered. Flooded by an array of mixed emotions, Lacy allowed her husband's soft touches and seductive words wash over her. She needed to feel grounded and safe in a world that just recently offered up a plate of uncertainty.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>After his fifteen minutes of fame in the sack, he rolled over and fell into a light sleep. Left unsatisfied, Lacy slipped out of bed, picked up her husband's discarded clothes and headed to the bathroom for a shower. </p>
		<p>She hung his jacket on the bathroom doorknob, slipped out of her clothes, plunging into the hot steamy water in hopes of washing away the day's unsettling events. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>When Lacy heard the telephone ring, she stepped out of the shower, water still running. Not wanting to wake her husband, she rushed to the bathroom door. Grasping her husband's jacket, the doorknob slipped out of her hand causing the door to creak open slightly. With jacket in hand, Lacy heard her husband answer the telephone. </p>
		<p>"Hello." He answered groggily, quickly looking around the room upon hearing the familiar voice on the other end of the telephone line. "I told you I'd call you."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Silence filled the room for a brief moment as Lacy listened.</p>
		<p>"No, she's in the shower." David sighed heavily. "I haven't had time to talk with her about it." A brief pause. "Listen, Hayston, if I wasn't serious about it then why do you think I killed her character off in the finale."</p>
		<p>Shocked, Lacy couldn't believe what she was hearing.</p>
		<p>Leary of his wife's return, David said hastily. "Yea, I'll call ya later and I love you, too, babe." David closed the conversation with a proffered kiss that traveled the phone line and planted itself on the smiling lips of Hayston Rawlings. He replaced the cell phone on the nightstand, listened momentarily to the water still running in the bathroom then pulled the covers up over his head.</p>
		<p>Her hands tightened around his jacket like a noose squeezing the neck of a condemned man. The crunch of papers inside his jacket drew her attention. She eased up on her grip, placing the jacket over a small chair. As she did, several papers fell to the floor. Retrieving them, Lacy scanned the contents without much regard until the word &#145;divorce' jumped out at her.
			<i>Divorce papers! </i>Her mind reeled from the conversation her husband had just shared with her co-star to several months ago when David laid out the reasons as to why it would be the best thing to do in killing off her character. A light flipped on in her mind shining brightly and more pieces of the puzzle fell into place. Lacy slid down the door to the floor, stunned.
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>For what seemed like eternity, she stared into space. Debating between waking David up or waiting till morning to &#145;discuss' this revelation. She found she didn't have the strength for either. With her world crumbling before her, Lacy sought a safe haven, far away from her troubles. Unsteady on her feet, she threw on a robe, crossed the bedroom oblivious to the sleeping producer, down the hall for a quick check on her children then fled from the cabin. In the deep, darkness of the night, she found her way instinctively to the only place where she would find sanctuary.</p>
		<p>Creeping softly across the damp boards, Lacy peeked inside the door. A stream of moonlight lay across the peaceful sleeping features of the only one that could redeem her soul from the dark abyss in which it was falling. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Gage." Lacy called softly.</p>
		<p>Gage had been watching Lacy as she hesitated briefly then called to her. "Lacy, what is it?"</p>
		<p>She stepped in, closing the door behind. "I....would you mind...." Her voice wavered, on the verge of tears; Lacy succumbed to her heart's desire. "I need you."</p>
		<p>Gage threw back the covers on the twin bed, welcoming her friend. "Come here." The gentle command, like a magnet, pulled Lacy across the room, sliding into home. Safe at last.</p>
		<p>Gage gathered Lacy in her arms, dragging the covers up over them. Lacy cried softly, releasing the flood of emotions whirling like a vortex throughout her mind, body and soul. "I...I..." Her words stumbled helplessly. </p>
		<p>"Let it out. I'm here." Assuring Lacy of her devout friendship, the writer molded their bodies together in silent affirmation that Gage would be there forever if only Lacy would allow it.</p>
		<p>Long moments later, sobbing, Lacy recounted the conversation she had witnessed between Hayston and her husband, adding the discovery of the divorce papers. She spilled out her doubts, her fears and the unsettling direction her future would take, not only for her, but, more importantly, for the kids. </p>
		<p>Pulling the star even closer, Gage sent every bit of love she had for Lacy to her, willing it to heal the broken women in her arms. Gage determined then and there to do anything, everything, whatever it took to help Lacy, no matter what.
			<i>For the woman I love.</i>
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>
			Admitting this fact didn't shock her. For Gage had fallen in love with Lacy from the first moment when forsaken green met soulful blue. She recalled seeing Lacy that day dressed casually in light blue jeans, a form fitting burgundy tank top and the bluest, sexiest eyes she'd ever seen. But it was the sound of her velvet voice that held Gage prisoner, happy to serve a life sentence.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy finally fell into a deep sleep. Holding the beautiful woman in her arms, Gage brushed her lips against Lacy's forehead, closed her eyes, and quietly whispered, "Goodnight."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Fifteen">
		<p>A groggy David woke to the smell of frying bacon. He slipped out of bed, made his way down the short hallway to the kitchen to be greeted to what appeared to him to be a happy family moving about having their breakfast together. Scratching his head,
			<i>What's wrong with this picture?</i>
		</p>
		<p>A light bulb above his head switched on, as he stood there clothed only in his boxer shorts.
			<i>This is my family. </i>Glaring at the stranger from last night,
			<i>Who the hell is she anyway? </i>Gage went about fixing breakfast, ignoring the half naked producer staring a hole in her.
		</p>
		<p>"David?" Lacy said, sitting a plate on the table. "Join us." The glee in her voice was strikingly annoying to the still jet-lagged producer. But it was the shrill grating noise of the whistle Dani blew that blasted against his early morning jagged edge.</p>
		<p>"Dani!" Aggravated, he piped out. "Stop it."</p>
		<p>Immediately, she let the ever-present whistle drop from her mouth to dangle on the cord around her neck. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>"You're going to be nine soon. Don't you think it's about time you grew up?" Agitated in a rare show beyond his usual placid demeanor with his daughter, David recoiled at Lacy's next stern words.</p>
		<p>"David! I suggest you go back and get some clothes on. And take some time to.... re-evaluate your attitude this morning." An arched eyebrow left no doubt to him that this was not a woman to be reckoned with. Not this morning anyway. It was uncommon for his wife's angry temperament to raise its ugly head. "Now." This last word spoken with true grit caused the usual confidant and &#145;
			<i>I bow to no one' </i>producer to scoot down the hallway like a child in trouble.
		</p>
		<p>"What the hell's up with her this morning?"
			David cursed, as he jumped into his trouser, tucked in his shirt and hunted for his jacket. Slipping on his suit coat, David marched back into the kitchen with resolve to straighten his wife's attitude out before he let the hammer fall.
		</p>
		<p>"Lacy!" David said just short of a shout. "We need to talk. Now." Casting a hateful look to Gage, he added. "Alone."</p>
		<p>"David." Lacy calmly said as her daughter carefully watched the interaction between her mother and father. "Sit down and have some breakfast first. Then we'll
			<i>talk</i>." The sarcastic twist Lacy spun on her last word sent an odd shiver through him.
		</p>
		<p>After breakfast, David determined to recapture domination of his family situation that was spiraling out of control since the break of dawn. He coughed then politely asked. "Gage, is it? I'd like to talk to my family alone. That is, if you don't mind." The caustic tone cut sharp, but no one was within striking distance.</p>
		<p>Gage remained steadfast as Lacy informed her, for the moment, husband. "Gage isn't going anywhere. Unless she wants to. This is her cabin."</p>
		<p>"What do you mean, her cabin?" David inquired, holding the razor sharp edge to his voice in check.</p>
		<p>"Somebody broke into our cabin and we've been staying here with Gage. She tells stories you know." Dani supplied, finishing her last bite of food.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Stories?" Derek happily clapped his hands.</p>
		<p>"Later." Gage picked him up and sat Derek on her lap.</p>
		<p>David glared at his wife. "Mind telling me what's been going on?"</p>
		<p>Picking up her plate, Lacy stood. "Dani, you go with Gage and Derek, I'd like to talk with your father alone." She nudged Dani up off the chair. "Now, go on." Lacy nodded to Gage adding a smile that said &#145;everything would be alright'.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>With both kids in tow, Gage walked outside, heading to the boathouse. Having looked back only twice, Gage hoped Lacy would be okay in handling the delicate situation with her husband. Uncertain of the influence David had over his wife, Gage was deeply concerned what the outcome of their talk my yield. Gage discovered that Lacy had a very trusting nature and generally was willing to go along with things, sometimes just to placate the person or the situation and not make waves. Gage had no idea how deeply ingrained in Lacy this had become due to her husband's subtle manipulating domination. </p>
		<p>Turning to David, Lacy gathered her strength. Generally, she didn't like confrontations, steering clear of them at all costs. "David." Lacy started to explain.</p>
		<p>"No. First, you explain to me why you didn't inform me of the break in and why you're staying here at .... her cabin. And," Slamming his fist on the table, he shouted. "Just who the fuck is she anyway?"</p>
		<p>Like a picture frozen in time, Lacy remained still. David fumed, stalked across the floor then waited for some sort of explanation. Finally, she asked. "Have you calmed down yet?"</p>
		<p>With controlled anger, he sat. "Go ahead." He said through clenched teeth.</p>
		<p>"I did call you. The machine picked up. As a matter of fact, I haven't been able to reach you at all. Been busy?" The sharp sarcastic tone edged from her voice did not go unnoticed by David. "And yesterday when you avoided Dani's question about going to the fair, I knew you had a change of plans in mind. I didn't want you to use the break in as an excuse to modify our plans."</p>
		<p>He started to protest, but she cut him off. "Don't even deny it. I've known you too long. It's your usual style. We make plans with the family and something always....always comes up."</p>
		<p>"That's not true, babe. Besides, what do you want me to do? Just forget about work."</p>
		<p>"David, what was I wearing when you showed up yesterday?"</p>
		<p>"What?" Dumbfounded, David looked at her.</p>
		<p>"It's a simple question. What was I wearing?"</p>
		<p>"I... clothes." David didn't have a clue as usual. "Hell, babe, I don't know... jeans, I think. What does this have to do with anything?"</p>
		<p>"Apparently nothing." Lacy said, surprisingly calm. "I realized, just recently, I've become an.... ornament in your life. And our marriage, well, let's just say, it's a.... was a deal sweetener." Fueled by finding the divorce papers the evening before which hit her like a shock of icy cold water, Lacy took stock of her marriage with David and what it had become. The cold hard reality of it blew through her like a howling whip of shivering wind. The whirlpool of emotions froze solid and the whole comprehension of their relationship would take time to thaw. </p>
		<p>"You've lost me completely."</p>
		<p>"No, you've lost me." She corrected him.</p>
		<p>"What?" Confusion reigned heavily in his mind.</p>
		<p>She handed him the divorce papers. "I've signed them." Turning on him with a predatory glare, Lacy said with steel affirmation. "I get the kids."</p>
		<p>Shocked, he fought to formulate words of protest. </p>
		<p>Raising her hand, Lacy stopped him cold. "One, you didn't want Derek. Remember your attempts at getting me to get an abortion. The show must go on you said. Two, you weren't involved with them anyway. Work always came first and, three, I don't think you'll have time, not now, with your new girlfriend."</p>
		<p>"Come again."
			<i>How the hell could she know?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			"Hayston Rawlings. My ever loyal co-star and even more supposed loyal husband in a clandestine tryst." Lacy shook her head in mock shame.
		</p>
		<p>It was like a stun gun had slapped him in the face.
			<i>She couldn't know anything. I've been so careful and she's always believed me before. </i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Seeing his bewilderment, she filled him in. "I overheard you're conversation last night. The rest was easy. Oh, by the way, tell me again, why you killed off my character in the finale." She smiled sweetly. "You might want to tell the truth this time. Was it a deal you just couldn't refuse? Maybe it has something to do with this mystery movie you have with Griffen and Hayston." Waving her hand, Lacy walked away before he could. "Never mind, I don't want to know." Triumph filled her every pore albeit a sad one at that. "And don't call me babe."
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>David, with bag in hand, reluctantly walked the short distance to his car. </p>
		<p>"It's okay. Go ahead, David. The shoes on the other foot, isn't it?" Lacy said.</p>
		<p>"I don't mind telling you I haven't understood one thing you've said since I arrived yesterday." David retorted snidely.</p>
		<p>"Then let me explain. You're usually the one that walks out when we're having a &#145;discussion'. How does it feel? You know I loathed that, didn't you?"</p>
		<p>He opened the car door, tossed in the bag then turned toward Lacy. "Apparently, I'm still the one walking out." David flashed a smile, syrupy sweet.</p>
		<p>"You don't get it, do you?" Lacy shook her head, feeling sorry for her husband of ten years. </p>
		<p>Having a hard time understanding his wife's new attitude, David slid into the car then said. "No, what I don't get is you." </p>
		<p>"That's right you don't." A firm voice confirmed. David turned to the origin of that steely voice, meeting cold green eyes. "The kids are inside. In case you wanted to say goodbye."</p>
		<p>David slammed the door, started the engine and left. Dani stood at the window, gazing out as her father's car traveled down the road away from her. She hadn't heard the exchange between her parents, but she was wise enough to deduce that life would never be the same. </p>
		<p>When Lacy and Gage walked back into the cabin, Dani asked. "Are we going back home now?"</p>
		<p>"No, not quite yet." Lacy answered solemnly.</p>
		<p>Hesitantly, she asked another question, waiting on bated breath for the answer. "When we do, will daddy be there waiting for us?"</p>
		<p>Lacy dropped down next to her daughter, pulling her into a warm, comforting embrace. Dani had her answer in the silence that hung in the air.</p>
		<p>Derek walked up to his mother, tugged on her sleeve and asked. "Jage go with us home?"</p>
		<p>Tears welled in Dani, Lacy and Gage's eyes, but for different reasons. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Night fell upon the cabin and the solemn mood that blanketed its residents the rest of the day was still held in check. When Lacy mentioned it was bedtime, Dani studiously grabbed her younger brother's hand and led him to their bedroom to change. Lacy caught up with them in the bathroom as Dani was putting the finishing touches to brushing her teeth. </p>
		<p>As she walked out the door, Dani turned right instead of left taking her into the second bedroom. Lacy followed with Derek on her heels. "Are you sleeping in here tonight?" Lacy asked, wondering why her daughter hadn't decided to pounce on Gage's bed as usual. </p>
		<p>Tucking herself in, Dani confirmed. "Yes." Seeing the surprise on her mother's face, the young girl continued. "Jeez, I am going to be nine soon." Her father's words echoed in Lacy's thoughts, but were firmly pounding away in the young girl's mind. </p>
		<p>"I see." She lifted Derek upon the other twin bed. "Then I guess you're old enough to watch over your brother tonight." </p>
		<p>"I am." The seriousness in her tone for some strange reason caused Derek to giggle. </p>
		<p>Lacy leaned down to kiss her son then did the same to her daughter. "Then I'll rest easy tonight. Thank you." She gave her daughter a confident wink.</p>
		<p>Gage finished putting up some games that had occupied their subdued time for part of the evening. She watched Lacy amble across the room into the kitchen, drawing a glass of water. "You okay?"</p>
		<p>Finishing her water, Lacy replaced the glass. Wandering back into the living room, she finally slipped down on the couch. Inhaling deeply, she let the chest full of air escape slowly in a deep sigh. "It's just been a trying day."</p>
		<p>"Want to talk about it?" Gage checked the doors, ensuring they were locked, but keeping a careful eye on the quiet star.</p>
		<p>"Maybe later." The laconic answer left more questions begging to be answered, hanging heavily in the air. </p>
		<p>"You going to bed then?" Gage was running out of things to say hoping to jumpstart Lacy into unleashing the foreboding feelings welling up inside. </p>
		<p>"I think I'll just read some." Lacy threw a quick glance to the writer. "Would you mind if I read one of your stories?"</p>
		<p>Hesitant, Gage nodded. "Sure." She retrieved her latest screenplay from her leather satchel. Handing it to Lacy, the writer then turned, walking to the bedroom, she whispered. "Goodnight."</p>
		<p>Lacy knew Gage wanted to talk and the irony was that it was the exact same thing she wanted, but found the irresistible urge to do that beyond her capabilities in that moment.</p>
		<p>Instead of finding sleep, Gage called Mark Calico, her friend and partner. "Mark, hey, did I wake you up?"</p>
		<p>"And if you did, would it really matter?" Mark's sleepy voice offered an attempt at brevity.</p>
		<p>Silent, Gage sighed. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>"No, I'm sorry. I was just kidding." Mark recognized his friend's troubled state easily now. "What's wrong?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing really. Hey, what did you say the other day about my book?"</p>
		<p>Taking a moment to merge onto the same track as his friend, Mark recounted their conversation. "It hit the top ten. Great news, huh?"</p>
		<p>A small chuckle escaped. "I wonder what I was thinking when you told me that. It sure didn't sink in."</p>
		<p>"I believe you were in hot pursuit of my arch enemy. The wasp." Mark laughed. "How'd that turn out?"</p>
		<p>"Don't ask?"</p>
		<p>"Okay, what can I ask then?" Mark was concerned now. </p>
		<p>"It's what I want to ask of you." </p>
		<p>"Anything." Mark assured her.</p>
		<p>"Do you have any contacts in Hollywood? I know you do. But I'm talking about people you could find out information from on the QT." Gage asked.</p>
		<p>"What do you want to know?" As always, she knew her good friend would come through for her.</p>
		<p>As Gage hung up the phone, Lacy cleared her throat. "Hi."</p>
		<p>"You finished already?" Gage asked surprised.</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Please don't tell me it was boring or, heaven forbid, you didn't like it." Gage smiled indicating she was joking.</p>
		<p>"Can I come in?" Seeing Gage nod, Lacy walked in, not stopping until she slipped into bed along side the writer. "I didn't even get started. Too much on my mind."</p>
		<p>"Can I help?"</p>
		<p>Lacy spent a few moments regaling Gage with her life story zeroing in on her relationship with David over the years along with snippets about Hayston Rawlings and how David referred to her as &#145;babe'. Sarcasm dripped like venomous poison as she said that last word.</p>
		<p>"You don't like to be called &#145;babe'?" Gage asked, making a mental note for later.</p>
		<p>"I hate it." Disgust flashed across her face. "But when you lov..care about someone, I don't know, it seems to fade into the background. He meant it as an endearment."</p>
		<p>Another thing that bothered Lacy was the fact that David didn't seem at all concerned about her upcoming pairing with Koda Kannon. Aware of Koda's flirtatious ways, David showed no sign of jealousy. His only response was his humongous ego roaring loudly, unconcerned that Lacy would even be tempted by anyone else when compared to him. Lacy then wondered how the writer would feel if faced with the same situation. "Gage, if you cared for someone and, let's say, the person you loved was doing a movie. And, well, the....there was a love scene and the other person was a real charmer always getting their co-star to fall for them. Well, how would you feel about that?" She peered deeply into the writer's thoughtful green eyes.</p>
		<p>"You mean, the woman I love....." Lacy took serious note of Gage's gender reference. "Was being charmed by an irresistible Casanova. Would I be jealous? Most definitely.... yes."</p>
		<p>"So you'd be jealous." She recounted more to herself.</p>
		<p>A wide smile swept over Gage's face. "I don't have green eyes for nothing." </p>
		<p>"What would you do?" Lacy asked tentatively.</p>
		<p>She shrugged. "It's her decision. Doesn't mean I'd have to like it though." Gage turned. "Of course, I would trust her with our love. With all my heart." She finished, gazing into the star's sparkling eyes. </p>
		<p>Suspecting Gage's feelings toward her ran parallel as her own feelings toward the writer, Lacy quizzed. "What was I wearing the first day we met?"</p>
		<p>Surprised by the question, Gage offered a cavalier response. "Clothes." Quick to see it was not the answer Lacy was looking for, Gage turned resolute. "Let's see, jeans, light blue and a deep burgundy tank top..."
			<i>That was so tight I could...</i> Gage cleared her throat. "...tennis shoes....." A smile rose on her face in remembrance, temporarily forgetting that the woman lying next to her was the same woman she was now intimately describing. "Blue eyes, very blue....beautiful blue eyes that reigned over a brilliant smile." Out of the side of her eyes, Gage saw that same brilliant smile shining back at her.
			<i>Uh oh! </i>Gage shifted alarmed green eyes back and forth waiting for the bomb to explode at her unexpected revelation.
		</p>
		<p>"Thank you." With those words, Lacy scooted closer, shut her eyes and fell asleep. Then and only then did Gage let out a breath she knew she was holding. </p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Sixteen">
		<p>With the quick turnaround regarding her father's stay, Dani sunk into a bleak depression. Breakfast came and went only to be met by a silent eight year old. She refused any and all suggestions made by her mother. Lunch started out the same way as the early morning meal had and Lacy couldn't take the unbearable stillness any longer. "Gage, I was thinking..... today might be a good day to explore that cave. What do you think?" </p>
		<p>The unexpected suggestion jumpstarted the lifeless attitude Dani wore all day, perking up now, a slow smile crept across her face.</p>
		<p>"We could do that. What do you say Dani?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>Not one to waste time when on the verge of getting want she'd craved for days, Dani jumped up ready to go. With her constant companion strung around her neck, Dani blew it loudly. "Let's go."</p>
		<p>This triggered Derek. "Yo-yo. Want yo-yo." He hopped down from his chair, wobbled a bit as he gained his balance, searching for his favorite toy. He finally pulled it from the depths of the couch and strung it around his neck. Derek insisted that his yo-yo have a lanyard just like his sister's whistle. Happy now, he joined his sister waiting patiently at the door.</p>
		<p>"It's unanimous then." Lacy concluded. "Let me get some extra clothes. As I remember, it can get pretty damp inside that cave." Lacy dreaded and regaled in her decision to explore the cave. On the one hand, her daughter's depression did a one-eighty flip, but on the other, an unpleasant buried memory was bound to make its presence known.</p>
		<p>Walking up to the two would be explorers Gage opened the door. "And we need to get a few things ourselves." The three marched to the boathouse, retrieving two flashlights, matches, a universal tool, which included a small knife and some rope.</p>
		<p>"What's the rope for?" Dani questioned.</p>
		<p>"You never know." Her vague answer seemed to appease the young girl who couldn't care less as to why they would need some rope. "You remember the knots I showed you. Right?"</p>
		<p>"Yep, sure do." Dani stated as her mother approach them. "I'll lead." The self-appointed captain marched off confidently. </p>
		<p>"Uh, hmmm. Dani?" Lacy caught the captain's attention, pointing. "It's this way."</p>
		<p>Without missing a step, Dani did an about face leading her motley crew onward. </p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The mouth of the cave was wide and for the first fifty feet or so the ambient light illuminated it. Lacy delegated Gage to partner up with her son especially since he refused to leave her side while she glued herself to her overzealous daughter. "Let's all stay together."</p>
		<p>This did not sit well with Dani who had lofty ideas of trekking out on her own. "But I have my whistle in case.... you get lost."</p>
		<p>"And just what good would a whistle do me if I got lost?" Lacy asked.</p>
		<p>"If you got lost, I would just blow my whistle and you could head back toward it. Jeez."
			<i>Grown ups! </i>Adamantly sure that she would not be the one to lose her way; Dani cocked an eyebrow identical to the one her mother wore. The short battle of wills raged until Dani relented.
			<i>I'll let her have the glory. </i>"Fine, stay close behind me." She trotted off deeper in the cave.
		</p>
		<p>When the cave split, Lacy allowed her daughter to investigate the bigger tunnel that veered off to the right, staunchly refusing to entertain the idea of exploring the small tunnel which, of course, was much more enticing to Dani. Lacy nervously searched her bag for the extra flashlight and batteries, having found them she sighed in reassurance.</p>
		<p>Gage astutely noticed beads of moisture form on Lacy's forehead when she redirected her daughter to the larger tunnel. Before proceeding, Gage grasped her arm, with a soft whisper asked. "You okay?"</p>
		<p>Nodding, Lacy's mind took a short trip down memory lane. Her thoughts of the smaller tunnel bolted forward from the recesses of her mind. After a challenge from her older brother, Hank, the then eleven-year-old Lacy walked confidently into the cave armed with only a flashlight. Lacy discovered the small tunnel opened up to a fairly large theater like chamber. She gazed as the small pool glittered against the light from her flashlight just before the trick her mischievous three year older brother played on her came to light when her flashlight petered out as the batteries died. Deep in the alcove of the smaller cave's opening, Lacy spent half a day wandering aimlessly around in the cold, dark, damp tunnel desperately searching for the way out. </p>
		<p>When the rescue team led by her oldest brother, Denny, finally reached her, Lacy was in a state of hypothermia, barely conscious. After a full recovery, Lacy did find one advantage to the whole devastating event. She had her guilt-ridden brother, Hank, wrapped around her little finger for weeks. </p>
		<p>Seizing the opportunity to explore further, Dani edged down the cave with flashlight in hand, blowing her whistle, amazed at the sound of its echo. Gage brought up the rear with the second flashlight. They searched the cave for a couple of hours before Lacy called a halt to their little adventure.</p>
		<p>When one of the flashlights started to fade, Lacy quickly pulled out the extra one from her bag. Handing it to Gage, her hand shook violently. "I think its time we head back." Her words echoed in the cave emitting a tone that brooked no arguments. </p>
		<p>Not happy with her mother's proclamation, Dani pouted, but soon perked up when Gage announced. "The fair starts tomorrow and we want to get an early start. Right?" Gage touched Lacy's arm in reassurance and whispered. "When we go to town, I'll get some fresh batteries."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Retracing their steps, Dani paused a brief moment longingly eyeing the smaller tunnel opening before reluctantly following the rest of her crew out the mouth of the cave.
			<i>I need to check that....soon. I got a funny feeling about it. </i>
		</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Happy with the outcome of the day, Dani was ready and willing to hit the bed. Once again, she guided her brother to their bedroom as Lacy tucked them in.</p>
		<p>Gathering her nightclothes, Lacy entered the bathroom to change. A short time later she emerged, running into Gage who had just taken a quick peek in the second bedroom, checking on the children. </p>
		<p>"Oh. Sorry." Gage apologized.</p>
		<p>An awkward moment passed, blue searching green for the answer to her unspoken question, before Lacy reluctantly moved toward the second bedroom. "Good night."
			<i>I don't want to intrude but I wish......</i>
		</p>
		<p>Sucking in a deep breath of courage, the writer gently grabbed the star's arm turning her back around. "You know, those beds are awfully small and...I got this huge bed just down the hall." </p>
		<p>Her wish came true. Even as she followed Gage down the short hall, Lacy absent-mindedly made a case against sharing the huge bed. "Actually, they're not any smaller than the one we shared in the boathouse."</p>
		<p>Gage abruptly turned, confronting her invited guest. "And your point is?"</p>
		<p>Understanding reigned supreme, quickly amending her earlier statement. "It was a bit uncomfortable." Gage offered a raised eyebrow of her own. "I mean, it was nice.... but small." Caught between a twin and a king size palette, she sighed. "Can we just go to bed?"</p>
		<p>"My thought exactly."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>It didn't take long for Gage to change and join her bed companion. Neither ready to have the day end, they rested together in silence glancing covertly at each other from time to time until Lacy quietly asked. "Tell me about your friend Mark.....and your future plans. Making movies together." She added quickly, not wanting the writer to discover the remnants of jealousy that lingered when it came to Gage's mysterious business partner. </p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"We're just starting our production company really. Getting ready to produce my first screenplay. Mark's been doing a lot of the pre-production, getting a crew lined up while I finished writing this other story." Gage said, glad to talk about her project. "Mostly, I guess, I really want to write, but I always thought it would be exciting making a movie." She propped herself up on her elbow, looking at the star lying next to her. "Is it?"</p>
		<p>"Yes and no." Lacy answered, gazing at an unidentified spot in the air. </p>
		<p>"Talkative, aren't we?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. I was just thinking." Turning her full attention to Gage, she continued. "It can be. You get to experience so many different things. Learning to shoot a gun, self-defense, dressing up and... you get paid for it." Her expression turned grave. "Though it doesn't make up for the long hours.... missed hours with your family, children.....failing them." </p>
		<p>"Hey, I've seen you with your kids. They adore you."</p>
		<p>Without really listening, she elucidated further. "Two failed marriages doesn't....."</p>
		<p>"You can have that and not be in show business." Gage stated.</p>
		<p>"My first marriage failed because of my career and this one, well, it's crumbling as we speak." Thoughtful, she continued. "It's ironic, with Jason, I was full speed ahead on pursuing my career and he wanted something different for us. With David, I'm the one who is looking for something different. At least, slow down a bit while David keeps shifting into a higher gear."</p>
		<p>"How long were you married to Jason?" Gage asked. </p>
		<p>"Almost two years. It's been ten with David. Why?"</p>
		<p>"Why? Why do you keep categorizing your relationships as failures?"</p>
		<p>"Because they ended. They didn't last." Perplexed by the question.</p>
		<p>"Lacy, from what you've told me about your first marriage... you said was mostly good and with David, two great kids and ten years together seems more of a success if you delete the forever clause. You did have lots of great times, didn't you?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, we did." A pause. "It was only after Derek was born that things started to... we grew apart, wanting different things." Lacy confirmed, adding more to her self. "I realize that now."</p>
		<p>"In every relationship, no matter how long it lasts.... it seems to me if you enjoyed it, learned from it." Altering the pace of the conversation. "Listen, relationships change every day. They evolve.... grow. Once you stop growing, you start to die. Sometimes we grow together, sometimes not. Instead of calling it a failure, the worst you can say is that it changed or you can just as easily say these relationships were successes."</p>
		<p>"I suppose so." A hiatus filled the air. "Society would disagree though."</p>
		<p>"Are you a slave to society?" Gage countered.</p>
		<p>"As much as I'd like to say no, I'm sure I am in some things." Lacy admitted, thinking of the feelings she'd recently been experiencing about Gage while still being married.
			<i>And then there's the fact that we're both females.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Noticing the frown play on the star's face, she changed the gloomy subject and Gage inquired. "What do you want out of life now?"</p>
		<p>"I did want more children." Lacy didn't hesitate. "But now...." She let this thought dangle in the air.</p>
		<p>"What about your career?"</p>
		<p>"I'd like to continue it. But not at the expense of my children. Never that again." The star vowed. "You?"</p>
		<p>"I already told you about my career plans." Gage flopped back down. "Though what I really want is to be with the love of my life. My soul mate."</p>
		<p>"You believe in that concept, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely."</p>
		<p>The writer's assuredness to that question prompted the next one. "You know who it is?"</p>
		<p>"I have an idea." Seeing the questioning look from the woman beside her, Gage allowed a wicked grin to grow on her face.</p>
