<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Sixteen -->

<p>With the quick turnaround regarding her father's stay, Dani sunk into a bleak depression. Breakfast came and went only to be met by a silent eight year old. She refused any and all suggestions made by her mother. Lunch started out the same way as the early morning meal had and Lacy couldn't take the unbearable stillness any longer. "Gage, I was thinking..... today might be a good day to explore that cave. What do you think?" </p>
		<p>The unexpected suggestion jumpstarted the lifeless attitude Dani wore all day, perking up now, a slow smile crept across her face.</p>
		<p>"We could do that. What do you say Dani?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>Not one to waste time when on the verge of getting want she'd craved for days, Dani jumped up ready to go. With her constant companion strung around her neck, Dani blew it loudly. "Let's go."</p>
		<p>This triggered Derek. "Yo-yo. Want yo-yo." He hopped down from his chair, wobbled a bit as he gained his balance, searching for his favorite toy. He finally pulled it from the depths of the couch and strung it around his neck. Derek insisted that his yo-yo have a lanyard just like his sister's whistle. Happy now, he joined his sister waiting patiently at the door.</p>
		<p>"It's unanimous then." Lacy concluded. "Let me get some extra clothes. As I remember, it can get pretty damp inside that cave." Lacy dreaded and regaled in her decision to explore the cave. On the one hand, her daughter's depression did a one-eighty flip, but on the other, an unpleasant buried memory was bound to make its presence known.</p>
		<p>Walking up to the two would be explorers Gage opened the door. "And we need to get a few things ourselves." The three marched to the boathouse, retrieving two flashlights, matches, a universal tool, which included a small knife and some rope.</p>
		<p>"What's the rope for?" Dani questioned.</p>
		<p>"You never know." Her vague answer seemed to appease the young girl who couldn't care less as to why they would need some rope. "You remember the knots I showed you. Right?"</p>
		<p>"Yep, sure do." Dani stated as her mother approach them. "I'll lead." The self-appointed captain marched off confidently. </p>
		<p>"Uh, hmmm. Dani?" Lacy caught the captain's attention, pointing. "It's this way."</p>
		<p>Without missing a step, Dani did an about face leading her motley crew onward. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The mouth of the cave was wide and for the first fifty feet or so the ambient light illuminated it. Lacy delegated Gage to partner up with her son especially since he refused to leave her side while she glued herself to her overzealous daughter. "Let's all stay together."</p>
		<p>This did not sit well with Dani who had lofty ideas of trekking out on her own. "But I have my whistle in case.... you get lost."</p>
		<p>"And just what good would a whistle do me if I got lost?" Lacy asked.</p>
		<p>"If you got lost, I would just blow my whistle and you could head back toward it. Jeez."
			<i>Grown ups! </i>Adamantly sure that she would not be the one to lose her way; Dani cocked an eyebrow identical to the one her mother wore. The short battle of wills raged until Dani relented.
			<i>I'll let her have the glory. </i>"Fine, stay close behind me." She trotted off deeper in the cave.
		</p>
		<p>When the cave split, Lacy allowed her daughter to investigate the bigger tunnel that veered off to the right, staunchly refusing to entertain the idea of exploring the small tunnel which, of course, was much more enticing to Dani. Lacy nervously searched her bag for the extra flashlight and batteries, having found them she sighed in reassurance.</p>
		<p>Gage astutely noticed beads of moisture form on Lacy's forehead when she redirected her daughter to the larger tunnel. Before proceeding, Gage grasped her arm, with a soft whisper asked. "You okay?"</p>
		<p>Nodding, Lacy's mind took a short trip down memory lane. Her thoughts of the smaller tunnel bolted forward from the recesses of her mind. After a challenge from her older brother, Hank, the then eleven-year-old Lacy walked confidently into the cave armed with only a flashlight. Lacy discovered the small tunnel opened up to a fairly large theater like chamber. She gazed as the small pool glittered against the light from her flashlight just before the trick her mischievous three year older brother played on her came to light when her flashlight petered out as the batteries died. Deep in the alcove of the smaller cave's opening, Lacy spent half a day wandering aimlessly around in the cold, dark, damp tunnel desperately searching for the way out. </p>
		<p>When the rescue team led by her oldest brother, Denny, finally reached her, Lacy was in a state of hypothermia, barely conscious. After a full recovery, Lacy did find one advantage to the whole devastating event. She had her guilt-ridden brother, Hank, wrapped around her little finger for weeks. </p>
		<p>Seizing the opportunity to explore further, Dani edged down the cave with flashlight in hand, blowing her whistle, amazed at the sound of its echo. Gage brought up the rear with the second flashlight. They searched the cave for a couple of hours before Lacy called a halt to their little adventure.</p>
		<p>When one of the flashlights started to fade, Lacy quickly pulled out the extra one from her bag. Handing it to Gage, her hand shook violently. "I think its time we head back." Her words echoed in the cave emitting a tone that brooked no arguments. </p>
		<p>Not happy with her mother's proclamation, Dani pouted, but soon perked up when Gage announced. "The fair starts tomorrow and we want to get an early start. Right?" Gage touched Lacy's arm in reassurance and whispered. "When we go to town, I'll get some fresh batteries."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Retracing their steps, Dani paused a brief moment longingly eyeing the smaller tunnel opening before reluctantly following the rest of her crew out the mouth of the cave.
			<i>I need to check that....soon. I got a funny feeling about it. </i>
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Happy with the outcome of the day, Dani was ready and willing to hit the bed. Once again, she guided her brother to their bedroom as Lacy tucked them in.</p>
		<p>Gathering her nightclothes, Lacy entered the bathroom to change. A short time later she emerged, running into Gage who had just taken a quick peek in the second bedroom, checking on the children. </p>
		<p>"Oh. Sorry." Gage apologized.</p>
		<p>An awkward moment passed, blue searching green for the answer to her unspoken question, before Lacy reluctantly moved toward the second bedroom. "Good night."
			<i>I don't want to intrude but I wish......</i>
		</p>
		<p>Sucking in a deep breath of courage, the writer gently grabbed the star's arm turning her back around. "You know, those beds are awfully small and...I got this huge bed just down the hall." </p>
		<p>Her wish came true. Even as she followed Gage down the short hall, Lacy absent-mindedly made a case against sharing the huge bed. "Actually, they're not any smaller than the one we shared in the boathouse."</p>
		<p>Gage abruptly turned, confronting her invited guest. "And your point is?"</p>
		<p>Understanding reigned supreme, quickly amending her earlier statement. "It was a bit uncomfortable." Gage offered a raised eyebrow of her own. "I mean, it was nice.... but small." Caught between a twin and a king size palette, she sighed. "Can we just go to bed?"</p>
		<p>"My thought exactly."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It didn't take long for Gage to change and join her bed companion. Neither ready to have the day end, they rested together in silence glancing covertly at each other from time to time until Lacy quietly asked. "Tell me about your friend Mark.....and your future plans. Making movies together." She added quickly, not wanting the writer to discover the remnants of jealousy that lingered when it came to Gage's mysterious business partner. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"We're just starting our production company really. Getting ready to produce my first screenplay. Mark's been doing a lot of the pre-production, getting a crew lined up while I finished writing this other story." Gage said, glad to talk about her project. "Mostly, I guess, I really want to write, but I always thought it would be exciting making a movie." She propped herself up on her elbow, looking at the star lying next to her. "Is it?"</p>
		<p>"Yes and no." Lacy answered, gazing at an unidentified spot in the air. </p>
		<p>"Talkative, aren't we?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. I was just thinking." Turning her full attention to Gage, she continued. "It can be. You get to experience so many different things. Learning to shoot a gun, self-defense, dressing up and... you get paid for it." Her expression turned grave. "Though it doesn't make up for the long hours.... missed hours with your family, children.....failing them." </p>
		<p>"Hey, I've seen you with your kids. They adore you."</p>
		<p>Without really listening, she elucidated further. "Two failed marriages doesn't....."</p>
		<p>"You can have that and not be in show business." Gage stated.</p>
		<p>"My first marriage failed because of my career and this one, well, it's crumbling as we speak." Thoughtful, she continued. "It's ironic, with Jason, I was full speed ahead on pursuing my career and he wanted something different for us. With David, I'm the one who is looking for something different. At least, slow down a bit while David keeps shifting into a higher gear."</p>
		<p>"How long were you married to Jason?" Gage asked. </p>
		<p>"Almost two years. It's been ten with David. Why?"</p>
		<p>"Why? Why do you keep categorizing your relationships as failures?"</p>
		<p>"Because they ended. They didn't last." Perplexed by the question.</p>
		<p>"Lacy, from what you've told me about your first marriage... you said was mostly good and with David, two great kids and ten years together seems more of a success if you delete the forever clause. You did have lots of great times, didn't you?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, we did." A pause. "It was only after Derek was born that things started to... we grew apart, wanting different things." Lacy confirmed, adding more to her self. "I realize that now."</p>
		<p>"In every relationship, no matter how long it lasts.... it seems to me if you enjoyed it, learned from it." Altering the pace of the conversation. "Listen, relationships change every day. They evolve.... grow. Once you stop growing, you start to die. Sometimes we grow together, sometimes not. Instead of calling it a failure, the worst you can say is that it changed or you can just as easily say these relationships were successes."</p>
		<p>"I suppose so." A hiatus filled the air. "Society would disagree though."</p>
		<p>"Are you a slave to society?" Gage countered.</p>
		<p>"As much as I'd like to say no, I'm sure I am in some things." Lacy admitted, thinking of the feelings she'd recently been experiencing about Gage while still being married.
			<i>And then there's the fact that we're both females.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Noticing the frown play on the star's face, she changed the gloomy subject and Gage inquired. "What do you want out of life now?"</p>
		<p>"I did want more children." Lacy didn't hesitate. "But now...." She let this thought dangle in the air.</p>
		<p>"What about your career?"</p>
		<p>"I'd like to continue it. But not at the expense of my children. Never that again." The star vowed. "You?"</p>
		<p>"I already told you about my career plans." Gage flopped back down. "Though what I really want is to be with the love of my life. My soul mate."</p>
		<p>"You believe in that concept, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely."</p>
		<p>The writer's assuredness to that question prompted the next one. "You know who it is?"</p>
		<p>"I have an idea." Seeing the questioning look from the woman beside her, Gage allowed a wicked grin to grow on her face.</p>
