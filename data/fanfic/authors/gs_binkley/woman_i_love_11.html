<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Eleven -->

<p>The next morning the foursome spent a few hours hunting for rocks along the shoreline and surrounding area. Dani never mentioned the cave once. Happily, ensconced in one of her favorite pastimes, which she begrudgingly, admitted she shared with Gage.
			<i>I guess I should cut her a little slack. Anyone who can get as excited as I do about collecting rocks must be okay. And she did let me drive the boat. But....I won't mention the cave. I won't mention the cave. </i> Dani repeated as she continued her search alongside her new rock-hunting partner.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy distracted Derek allowing her daughter time to re-establish a connection with Gage. Dani was not used to competition from anyone even her brother, Derek, when it came to people she decided was worthy of her attention. It wasn't that Dani thought she was better than others, it was just that her natural gregarious disposition left her the center of attention that fit her like a glove and she usually wore it well. </p>
		<p>Lacy deduced that Dani wasn't so much jealous that Gage was closer to Derek then she was to Dani, but that outside of herself and Dani, Derek remained aloft to everyone else. For some reason, the fact that Derek had suddenly and unexpectedly expanded his realm of acceptance to include Gage was a mystery.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The rock hunt concluded when a deluge hit forcing them to the safety of the cabin where they had lunch and exchanged wet clothes for dry. The long, tiring morning induced the children into an afternoon nap.</p>
		<p>Lacy and Gage were enjoying a quiet moment, sipping hot chocolate. "Sorry bout that movie the other day." Gage had been waiting for the opportunity to present itself and apology to Lacy, having realized that watching it had disturbed her.</p>
		<p>"There's no need. It brought back some unwelcome memories." When Lacy returned with the deputy to find Gage and the kids watching a movie she had starred in, the reminiscences shook her. The surrounding events in making the movie caused her pain. It took her a minute to recognize the movie playing was the first one she has starred in, releasing a flood of hurtful recollections. "I made that movie around the time Jason and I, he was my first husband, decided to get a divorce. David produced it. It was my first real break."</p>
		<p>"Hey, you don't have to explain." Gage felt bad at being the catalyst for the sad memories Lacy was now re-experiencing. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy drew her long legs up underneath her, surprised to find she did want to talk about her failed marriage. "We were, would you believe, high school sweethearts. Anyway, Jason and I got married after I found out I was pregnant. He quit college, got a job in construction and I was going to forego my dream of an acting career to have a family."</p>
		<p>"You have another child?"</p>
		<p>"No, we.... I lost the baby." A sad reflection dawned before she continued. "After that, I was determined to forge head on in my career and demanded that we move to Hollywood. Jason gave in easily, giving up his plans of starting a construction company. He finally did, start a construction company, that is.... with my brother as a matter of fact. I got lost in the work while Jason just got lost. He didn't like anything about Hollywood. Eventually, I auditioned for David and got the part. My career was steadily building and my marriage was crumbling. That's when Jason gave me an ultimatum... my career or my marriage. Can you guess which one I chose?"</p>
		<p>"Lacy." Gage covered Lacy's hand, squeezing it in understanding. "Everything happens for a reason."</p>
		<p>"I realized that later. And I wouldn't have the two most precious joys of my life if I had chosen differently." A genuine smile escaped past the sad memories. "Jason and I were together almost three years and I can honestly say most of it was great. Although, we were more friends than...." She trailed off letting silence fill in the blank.</p>
		<p>"At least you had friends." The unexpected words spilled out.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"What do you mean? Surely, you have friends and what about family?" Lacy reasoned.</p>
		<p>Having opened the floodgates, Gage decided to share some of her history as Lacy had entrusted with her. "I really only have one friend, Mark Calico. He's my partner, too. But, I don't have any family."</p>
		<p>"You have a mother though. You said she gave you your name, right?" Confusion played for a moment in Lacy's mind.</p>
		<p>"She did. But, I never knew her."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"I don't understand."</p>
		<p>"She gave me up for adoption. It was some kind of deal she made that I would be named Gage." Forestalling Lacy from the expected question. "I don't know if it was a family name or what." Gage laughed. "Maybe Dani was right. She didn't like me that's why she gave it to me."</p>
		<p>"Gage!" Lacy reached up and lightly touched her cheek. "I like your name."</p>
		<p>A shy smile slowly rose. "There were times I thought about trying to find her.... I never got around to it. So, I figured it wasn't really that important to me."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Somehow to Lacy that statement didn't ring true. "I hope you do... one day."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, maybe." Gage offered a hollow agreement. "Mark's the only one I got that's family. Oh, and his grandfather. They're the only family I need." When Gage looked up to meet Lacy's warm blue eyes all of a sudden Mark and his grandfather were no longer enough. She wanted more. Needed more.</p>
		<p>Lacy's mind jealously lingered a long moment on the relationship Gage shared with her friend, Mark Calico.
			<i>Partner? What does she mean by partner? </i>But it was the hint of something more that flickered in Gage's green eyes that offered hope to Lacy that the writer would welcome and, yes, even come to need the friendship Lacy found she desperately craved to share with Gage.

		<hr></hr>
		<p>The rainy day kept them inside and after dinner, they settled in for an evening of games. Dani immediately chose her mother as her partner since she did not like to lose. And as much as she loved her brother, Dani figured Derek wouldn't be much help as they played her favorite game.</p>
		<p>Gage sitting on the floor with legs crossed, Derek plopped down on her lap, settling in as his sister geared up ready to give her mother the first clue. Gage had provided her with a movie title.</p>
		<p>Dani offered her first clue to which her mother responded. "Three words, first word ?the'."</p>
		<p>Nodding her head, Dani proceeded to the next word. She finally got her partner to answer ?little' after Lacy listed several other possibilities to include small, short and tiny. It was on the third word of the movie title that Dani used her creative abilities. She ran into the bedroom then hurried back, fell to the floor and stuck her legs into a pillowcase. Lying on the floor, Dani pretended to swim. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"The Little Mermaid." Lacy answered causing Dani to jump up, legs still wrapped in the pillowcase, and hop around at having her partner correctly decipher the clues.</p>
		<p>After several more volleys back and for between the teams, Dani was upset that her brother's team was ahead in points. She couldn't believe it. So, she suggested the movie title, The Poseidon Adventure, which Lacy shoot down and provided another one of her own for the other team to guess. </p>
		<p>Lacy helped her son, giving him a small bowl of water so he could give the clue to his partner. Derek carefully carried the bowl from the kitchen to the living room area. His mother whispered in his ear.</p>
		<p>"Hey, don't help him. Gage has to get it on her own." Not liking to be behind in points, Dani ordered her partner.</p>
		<p>Happily, Derek slapped his hand in the water again and again, spraying it all over his partner.</p>
		<p>Wiping the flinging water from her face, Gage hurriedly yelled. "Splash. The movie's Splash." But her answer didn't stop the deluge from raining down. Throwing a mock angry look at Lacy who backed up quickly, Gage then jumped up, grabbing her partner in her arms after she whisked the empty bowl from him. "Okay, that's enough, partner. We got the points." After she returned the bowl to the kitchen, Gage and Derek rejoined the opposing team. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Our turn." Dani stood, anxiously waiting to get the title of the next movie from Gage. </p>
		<p>"Dani, it's my turn to give the clue." Lacy leaned down next to Gage as Dani reluctantly sat back down.</p>
		<p>Dani waited eagerly. They had one last chance to forge ahead in the points and win the game if only her mother would cooperate. According to Dani, Lacy had provided the other team with too many easy movie titles and her team had seriously dropped behind in points after an early start out of the gate. The young girl scrunched her face seriously awaiting her first clue.</p>
		<p>Dani was quick to deduce the movie title had two words and the first word was ?sling' after her mother slung her arms back and forth. Now, Lacy was diligently making a yanking motion from her side then waving her arm around in the air. Panic glared on Dani's face, not having a clue as to what her mother was demonstrating. "Wave?" Lacy shook her head. "Are you making some kind of sign?"</p>
		<p>Lacy rolled her eyes, then quickly started making jabbing motions in the air.</p>
		<p>"Sword. You've got a sword." A smile tickled her face in expected triumph. "Two words and the first word is sling. Sword, sling sword?"</p>
		<p>Lacy then ran her finger along an invisible sword pretending to cut it.</p>
		<p>"Blade. Sling Blade?" Dani quizzed then watched her mother jump in elation. Bolting up, she joined her partner. After a few moments participating in a shared victory dance, Dani approached the lead member of the opposing team. "Pretty good, huh? Especially since I've never even seen a movie called ?Sling Blade'."</p>
		<p>A short while later, a very tired young boy laid in his mother's arms. "Guess it's time for bed, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Good. Now we get to hear the end of the story and find out how Mecca gets out of that cave...." She eyed Gage carefully, before she continued. "With a little help from the Shanglon Master."</p>
		<p>"Honey, Derek's asleep. Maybe tomorrow night." Lacy offered.</p>
		<p>"But...." She turned to Gage.</p>
		<p>"No story tonight." Gage simply stated, then added after a prominent pout appeared on the disappointed girl's face. "Would you want me to finish telling the story to Derek if you were sleeping?"</p>
		<p>"No." Dani admitted. "But we still get to sleep in the big bed, right?" Even without her nightly dose of storytelling, Dani enjoyed the closeness the four of them shared sleeping in the same bed. It gave her a sense of being together as a family something she'd missed in the last several years with both her parents always working. But her hopeful mood dashed when her mother spoke.</p>
		<p>"We really should stay in our own room tonight, I guess." She spoke the words half-heartedly, hoping her suggestion would fall on deaf ears.</p>
		<p>Misunderstanding Lacy's concern about intruding further on the hospitality offered, Gage loathed to agree. "Sure. I guess, well, whatever."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A rush of disappointment ran through both mother and daughter. Lacy grabbed her daughter's hand and carried her son into their room when Gage shuffled off silently.</p>
		<p>After Lacy secured the children in bed, she heard a small knock at the door. "Come in."</p>
		<p>Gage offered a couple of blankets. "It's chilly out tonight. That rain brought in a cold front, I guess." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Taking the blankets, Lacy thanked her. A deafening silence fell as they stood still both waiting, hoping for the other to propose a way to move back the hands of time and lead them into the direction they both desired. Each momentarily contemplated the last three nights when they had all sleep together, safe, secure and at peace.</p>
		<p>Clearing her throat, Gage broke the silence. "If you need anything, anything at all, I'll be..."</p>
		<p>"Right down the hall." Lacy smiled at her.</p>
		<p>"Yeah."</p>
		<p>Both retreated into their own respective bedrooms, unhappy with the turn of events.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Gage wrapped herself in the covers, twisting and turning trying to find a comfortable position to sleep. It was funny, all her life she'd slept alone, but in the course of three nights, for the first time, Gage felt lonely. She missed the warm bodies crowded around her that somehow provided a calming comfort, lulling her to sleep.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She was still awake when the small knock at the door came. "Yes." Seeing Lacy enter with both her children, a smile jumped onto her face and refused to go away. Silently, she prayed neither would her new friends.</p>
		<p>"The heater must be out in our bedroom. It's pretty cold in there." Lacy explained.</p>
		<p>Jumping out of bed, Gage raced toward them. "Okay, I'll see if I can fix it." </p>
		<p>Stopping the writer from leaving the room, Lacy suggested. "I thought maybe we could, you know, spend the night in here. Then tomorrow you could find the problem."</p>
		<p>Seizing the unexpected opportunity, Gage hastily agreed.  "Yeah, that's a better idea. Come on." Gage took Derek from Lacy and headed to bed.</p>
		<p>Once they were all snuggled down, Gage whispered. "Yeah, this is definitely a better idea. Glad you came up with it."</p>
		<p>"Me too." Content Lacy fell asleep.</p>
