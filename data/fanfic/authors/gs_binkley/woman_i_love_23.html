<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Twenty-Three -->

<p>Backed into a corner, David Levine called his wife of ten years in order to make a deal that wouldn't leave him out in the cold. After his partner, Ryan White and boss, Ron Griffen was through with him, David was ready to concede to just about anything. Though he swore he wouldn't come off as a total weakling in front of his wife or Hayston, for that matter.</p>
		<p>"So, it's this way, Lacy. We both get custody of the kids." David insisted.</p>
		<p>"I get full custody, David. There is no debate about this. Griffen knows I'll back out of the movie deal and where would that leave you." Lacy used this leverage granted her by the head of Griffen Studios. Ron Griffen felt bad about pressing Lacy into making the movie exploiting her already guilty feelings about quitting. He led her to believe he'd lose tons of revenue. Although, Griffen and David had already hatched a plan for a spin off so they wouldn't be hurting for anything. And, Griffen wanted to get at David for going behind his back with MegaCom. The movie mogul didn't want to lose the talented thirty five year old producer; he just wanted to make David squirm.</p>
		<p>And squirm he did. "Fine. But I get to see them when I want."</p>
		<p>"I don't intend to keep them away from you, David. I want what's best for our children."</p>
		<p>Lightening his harsh tone, David charmingly suggested. "I don't guess there's any chance we could get back together." </p>
		<p>Nauseated, Lacy countered. "Why don't you ask Hayston? She may have something to say about it."</p>
		<p>"She has nothing to say about it." David smirked, but it swiftly turned into a weak and dismal grin that reached his pale gray eyes when Hayston walked up behind him, having heard the last part of their conversation, effectively ending his discussion with Lacy.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"What's a matter?" Gage asked, grabbing hold of Lacy, steadying her as she stood over the toilet.</p>
		<p>"Nothing." The star's pale features told another story. "Just a little sick to my stomach."</p>
		<p>Settling Lacy down on their bed, Gage felt the star's head to see if she had a fever, brushing the stars dark bangs aside. "No wonder with everything you've gone through in the last few days. I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>"Where are you going?" Said weakly.</p>
		<p>"To get you some crackers....I wonder if we have some seven-up." Gage said more to herself as she left the room.</p>
		<p>Lacy slid down on the bed, turning on her side. </p>
		<p>Returning quickly, Gage pulled the dark haired woman up. "Here." She handed Lacy the crackers and offered her a sip of the uncola. "How long have you felt like this?"</p>
		<p>Taking only a couple of sips and nibbling on a cracker, Lacy laid back down. "It hurts." She grabbed her stomach. "It's probably just cramps."</p>
		<p>"Okay." Gage bolted out of the room, returning in a flash. "Here are some pain killers....take two." She gave them to Lacy who obediently did, washing them down with the soda. "I think there's a heating pad somewhere." Gage entered the adjoining bathroom, rifling through the closet. "I got it."</p>
		<p>She plugged it up, handing it carefully to Lacy, securing it in place. Then curled up behind the star, covering them then wrapped comforting arms around the woman she loved. Nestling even closer, Gage whispered. "I love you." Then brushed healing lips softly against Lacy's smiling mouth. </p>
		<p>Dani followed the worried writer after she had made two frantic trips to the kitchen and back to the bedroom. From the doorway, the engaging scene played out before the young girl's blue eyes. Dani saw the love and tenderness Gage showed her mother. </p>
		<p>Dani backed away from the door leaving the two women alone. Plopping down on the couch, she heard Derek laugh at his favorite cartoon character. Pondering the scene she'd just witnessed, Dani collected from her memory all the evidence she had accumulated over the last couple of weeks regarding the subtle yet intimate interactions between her mother and Gage, leading the almost nine year old to one conclusion. This revelation reminded her of her earlier vow to be the very best daughter she could be for her mother. It made her smile, but also left many questions unanswered. </p>
		<p>That evening Dani readied her brother for bed then made a side trip to the master bedroom announcing that they were going to sleep and hoped her mother felt better. Dani didn't raise an eyebrow upon seeing her mother positioned against the writer snugly, which did not go unnoticed by either of them.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The next day Lacy was feeling better. Though Dani diligently watched her recovering mother so she went along with plans to go to town and restock up on their supplies for the remaining two weeks of vacation without complaint.</p>
		<p>That evening the foursome discussed plans for the rest of their vacation when Dani asked. "When's daddy coming back?" </p>
		<p>Breathing deeply, Lacy decided it was time to have that talk with her daughter. "Dani, come here." The thirty-year-old mother requested her daughter.</p>
		<p>Dani sat down beside her mother on the couch when Gage picked up the young boy. "Why don't I give you a bath, young man?" Gage offered, knowing green eyes sent a silent message to Lacy allowing her to have some privacy with her daughter. Tucked under the writer's arm, Gage slipped quietly down the hall with the squealing child.</p>
		<p>Shifting her daughter closer, Lacy began the long, laborious journey of explaining to an eight year old that her parents are separating. "Dani, you know, I love you? Both you and Derek."</p>
		<p>Shaking her head adamantly, Dani agreed.</p>
		<p>"And that will never change no matter what." She assured the young girl. "Though sometimes in adult relationships, people grow apart and that love.... changes."</p>
		<p>The astute eight-year-old knew where this road was heading. "You and daddy."</p>
		<p>Not surprised that her intelligent daughter surmised this conclusion, Lacy continued. "Yes. So your daddy... we're filing for divorce. But, like I said, that doesn't mean we don't love you both. Or that we will ever stop.....a parent's love for their child is forever. I love you, Dani."</p>
		<p>"I love you, too, mom." The usually expressive blue eyes turned dark.</p>
		<p>Pulling the dark haired girl closer, Lacy prayed whatever happened in the future she would do right by her kids. The children of divorced parents had a way of coming under fire between the battling ex-spouses and she vowed this would not happen to them. She also recognized that children sometimes withdrew, holding in their feelings and Lacy engineered a spontaneous plan to not let that happen. "As long as we talk about everything, things will be alright. I promise you. Can we promise to each other to do that.... about anything?" Then quickly added. "Do you have any questions?" </p>
		<p>With dark blue eyes, Dani captured ones that matched her own and asked seriously. "Mom, can I still love daddy?"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Gathering her daughter in her arms. "Of course, you can." Kissing her daughter's dark head, Lacy hugged her tightly. "You can love whomever you want. That doesn't change and no one will ever make you choose between us. Okay?"</p>
		<p>Relieved, Dani shook her head and made a definitive decision. "I think I'll go to bed. If Derek's through with his bath, I'll read to him. He loves that. Do you want me to tell him about you and daddy?"</p>
		<p>"How bout later, he's still a little young." Stopping her daughter's exit. "You know, Derek has the best big sister ever."</p>
		<p>This shoved a bright smile up on her face. "He does, doesn't he?"</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Oh, no, you don't." Lacy scrambled under Gage, trying to get away. Straddling the star, Gage held her captive tightly as she leaned over her. "I've got you now."</p>
		<p>"I could get away if I wanted to." Lacy assured her captor. </p>
		<p>Gage's smile widened. "Really?" Lacy wiggled again to no avail.</p>
		<p>Reaching up, Lacy took possession of the writer's waiting lips. The intoxicating sensations from the star's magnetic lips sent a dizzying Gage beyond conscious awareness. The blonde loosened her hold, falling into the seductive haze the dark haired women wove around her. With each kiss delivered, soft and tantalizing leaving a trail of burning fire everywhere the star's mouth touched. Gage moaned in appreciation.</p>
		<p>Delving deeper into the mind-boggling kiss, Lacy tossed the writer on to her back as she claimed herself conqueror. The younger woman slowly drew back causing Gage's beckoning lips to follow until Lacy left one last languid kiss between them. </p>
		<p>Clambering off the writer, Lacy said in victory. "I told you I could get away." </p>
		<p>Lacy was soon being chased by her eager lover. "Not for long." Gage in hot pursuit of her target jumped around a small chair, catching the leg's edge, hitting the floor hard. Within seconds she was back on her feet, stalking her prey. </p>
		<p>Lacy, cornered between the bed and the bathroom door, waited precisely for the moment Gage lunged at her then jumped on the bed trying to get away. </p>
		<p>But not soon enough before the writer snared one of the Lacy's long legs at the ankle, dropping her on the bed. Hastily climbing back on top the laughing star, Gage reclaimed her position. "Now you're mine."</p>
		<p>The words spoken silenced the pinned dark haired woman. Looking deeply into her lover's eyes, Lacy concurred. "Yes, I am."</p>
		<p>Lips met in an all-consuming passionate kiss, but ended too soon when Gage gently pushed her woman back down. "Stay there." As Gage knelt over Lacy she slowly, sensually removed every article of clothing on the woman below her. Hands pushed up the sides of her white t-shirt and over her head, flipping it behind her. Scooting down the writer released the snap at the top of her jeans then pulled the zipper down.</p>
		<p>Lacy cocked an eyebrow.</p>
		<p>Adroit fingers slipped under the edge of the jeans waistband, grasping the panties below. "Oh, these have got to go." In one quick smooth motion, Gage freed the younger woman from the confines of her pants. Laying back down on Lacy, the writer kissed her lover soundly. "Now that I have you where I want you."</p>
		<p>"You mean completely naked."</p>
		<p>Taking the opportunity to languidly let desire-filled green eyes linger down the sexy body of the star, Gage returned her hungry eyes to lust-filled blue ones. </p>
		<p>Firing her hands into action, Lacy tugged and pulled at Gage's clothes before they were stymied from any further pursuit. </p>
		<p>"Not yet." Gage admonished.</p>
		<p>Lacy's persistent hand tried again and failed being clasped securely by her lover.</p>
		<p>"Stay." Gage commanded allowing her voice to soften when she continued. "Please?"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Perfectly content to do as she was asked, Lacy basked in the surrounding warmth of love she felt from the blonde hovering over her. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Gage reached up, hesitating briefly to ensure that Lacy remained still then removed the gold mariner-linked necklace from around her neck. In silent question, Gage asked and received permission, placing the necklace around the lovely neck of her lover. "I wanted you to have something of mine."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Touching the necklace, Lacy smiled, placing her hand over Gage's heart. "I already do." Then touching the gold necklace. "But I love this. Thank you."</p>
		<p>Ducking her head to retrieve a quick kiss, Gage whispered. "You know if you wear this people will know....that you really do belong to me." A lopsided smile crossed her face. "Well, at least Mark."</p>
		<p>Offering thankful lips to her lover, Lacy assured her. "I want everyone to know it." In a show of her commitment to Gage, Lacy shed the diamond wedding ring from her finger, placing it on the night table. Returning devoted eyes to her lover briefly before she heard.</p>
		<p>"Momma." Derek called from the doorway.</p>
		<p>Startled, Gage slid to the side protecting the naked mother from the view of her child. </p>
		<p>Lacy popped her head up over her shield. "Honey, what is it?"</p>
		<p>"I got to pee." Holding himself as he nervously pranced about.</p>
		<p>Gage flipped the sheet up over Lacy before she hustled off the bed. Grabbing the young child's hand, Gage led him down the hallway to the bathroom only allowing a quick glance back at her very naked lover wrapped haphazardly in the white cover.</p>
		<p>After a few moments, Gage returned to find Lacy fully clothed again. "Oh, no, you don't." Stealthily, Gage inched forward, waggling her eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"That's the second time you've said that to me tonight." Lacy posed seductively, waiting for her lover on the huge bed. "I didn't know if you'd be coming back alone."</p>
		<p>"I never want to come alone." Green eyes flashed over the wicked grin she proudly wore then Gage lunged for the bed. "He's all tucked in." Nuzzling Lacy's neck, the writer murmured. "Shall we continue?" Teeth gently nipped at the soft skin on Lacy's throat.</p>
		<p>"Do we dare?" Lacy yelped as Gage did an excellent impression of Count Dracula.</p>
		<p>Scaling back on top of Lacy, she unintentionally tickled the star. Lacy squealed out in boisterous laughter. The blonde slide her hands along the same t-shirt she removed earlier intent on doing it again until two happy kids rushed into the room making a beeline for the bed.</p>
		<p>"A tickle fight." Dani yelled before she jumped on the bed.</p>
		<p>Derek pulled at the covers. "Me too. Me too." He complained before Gage pulled him up to join the spontaneous festivities. </p>
		<p>The four wrestled on the big bed laughing, wiggling and engaging in what would become a regular family event. As Gage skillfully found Lacy's bare ribs, she tickled her mercilessly. Dani and Derek enlisted in on the assault against their mother.</p>
		<p>Recalling the tickle fest Lacy told Gage about the morning of their big boat ride, it reminded the writer when she asked Lacy if she was ticklish and the star replied.
			<i>Only a lucky few get to know that. </i>Gage grinned, delighting in a thought of her own.
			<i>I guess I did get that lucky. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"I give. I give." Lacy surrendered to the trio.</p>
		<p>Gage and Dani relented, falling to either side of Lacy. Derek refused to budge from his place on top of his mother. Gazing on the star's perfect profile, Gage could see Dani on the other side of her mother intently staring at the gold necklace around the dark haired woman's neck. </p>
		<p>A sideways glance from Gage told Lacy something was wrong and that's when she felt the scrutiny of her daughter's stare send a shiver through her. Turning to face the young girl Lacy gritted for an explosive reaction.</p>
		<p>Shifting her blue eyes from the necklace to her mother, Dani watched Derek reach up and tug at the necklace. "Jage." He pulled, wanting to return it to his hero.</p>
		<p>Dani observed the apprehension on her mother's face. So, in a show of conviction to be the very best daughter ever, Dani leaned in close and whispered. "I saw her kiss you, mom. When you were sick." A pause. "I think she loves you." Dani concluded without a hint of consternation. The young girl, who was on the verge of being a very mature nine year old, reached forward gathering all of them together, stretching her arms beyond their normal reach. </p>
