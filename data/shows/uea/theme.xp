		<lyrics>
			We married young,
			Because of Cupid.
			And had three kids,
			Because we were stupid.

			She kicked me out,
			She's not my honey.
			But she still wants me,
			When she needs money.

			Now I'm alone,
			Come rain or sunny.
			But who needs love,
			I've got my bunny.
