<!-- What the Heart Wants \ Chapter 6 -->

<p>B'Elanna opened her eyes.  The lights in her quarters were still on at half intensity and she was lying on her couch holding a sleeping Seven of Nine.  She stretched her head back slowly feeling the kinks in her neck from sleeping in such an unusual position.  She spoke softly hoping not to awaken Seven; "Computer what time is it?"</p>
<p>"The time is 0231 hours."</p>
<p>She felt Seven stir in her arms and watched in wonder as the beautiful young woman opened her eyes and smiled upon seeing B'Elanna's face.</p>
<p>"Hey sleepyhead," B'Elanna teased.</p>
<p>"I really was asleep wasn't I," Seven queried softly?</p>
<p>"Sure, why?"</p>
<p>"It is just that I have never achieved a state of sleep before," she yawned.</p>
<p>"Never?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not believe I have ever been relaxed enough to perform this task before."</p>
<p>"Well, congratulations." B'Elanna paused, unsure of how to approach her next question.  "Um, Seven, do you need to regenerate before work tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"I believe that a period of sleep will be sufficient."</p>
<p>"OK, its just, I&#133;"</p>
<p>"You wish me to leave so you can return to your bed&#133;of course&#133;. I apologize for keeping you up this late."  Seven began to get up from the couch.</p>
<p>"No no, slow down sweetie." B'Elanna held the young Borg firmly in her arms to prevent her from escaping the room.</p>
<p>"If you think you can sleep why don't you just stay here.  You can have my bed, and I'll stay out here," B'Elanna offered.</p>
<p>"I would rather stay with you B'Elanna."  The need and the loneliness was so evident in Seven's words that B'Elanna felt her throat constrict and she had to fight back tears as she felt her own solitude echoed in her lover's words.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, B'Elanna climbed off the sofa and offered her hand to Seven, leading her into the bedroom.</p>
<p>"I guess you'll need something to sleep in," B'Elanna said almost to herself.</p>
<p>"I usually regenerate in my biosuit."</p>
<p>"That might not too comfortable once you get into bed.  I can replicate something for you if you like, or, you could wear something of mine."</p>
<p>This time Seven wasn't afraid of the answer to the question. "I believe I would like to wear an article of your clothing B'Elanna."</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled softly and rummaged through her drawer. "Hmm, the shorts shouldn't be a problem but I'm not sure I have a top that will work.  Hang on, these might fit," She pulled out a pair of silk boxer shorts and an old, oversized Starfleet academy tee shirt and handed the bundle to Seven.  </p>
<p>She rummaged some more and pulled out another pair of boxers, black, with a matching silk tank top that only covered part of her midriff.  Unsure of what to do next she opted to change in the bathroom and give Seven the bedroom while she undressed.</p>
<p>She waited until she was reasonably sure that Seven would have had time to change and then came back into the bedroom.  Seven was standing in front of the mirror staring at herself.  She looked absolutely adorable in B'Elanna's old clothes.</p>
<p>"Whatcha doin' Seven?"  B'Elanna inquired.</p>
<p>"I have never worn anything but a biosuit before now.  I am unused to my appearance, and unused to the sensation of this type of material next to my skin."  The truth was Seven loved the feel of the cotton and silk against her body.  She could smell B'Elanna's scent on the clothes and reveled in the idea of wearing something that had been so close to B'Elanna's skin.</p>
<p>"Well, you look great," B'Elanna breathed, coming up to Seven and wrapping her arms around her from behind, resting her forehead on the taller woman's shoulder.  She stared at their reflections in the mirror, thinking of how opposite they were in almost every way, but of how right it felt for them to be together like this.</p>
<p>"C'mon, we should try to get some sleep," B'Elanna gave Seven a final squeeze and then led her to the bed.  She pulled back the covers and then crawled in, lying on her back and watching as Seven gently eased her lanky frame onto the mattress. She lay flat on her back with her arms at her sides and stared at the ceiling for a few moments, adjusting to the feeling of the bed and pillow, then she turned to look at B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"I believe I am ready to attempt sleeping again," she smiled shyly B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"C'mere you," said B'Elanna as she pulled Seven into her arms, kissing her softly before settling the blonde head on her shoulder.  Seven wrapped her arm around B'Elanna and insinuated her leg between the Klingon's, snuggling deeply into the warm embrace.  B'Elanna called the lights down and they lay in the dark, each listening to the soft breathing of the other as they floated off to sleep.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>For the first time in her adult life Seven of Nine awoke in a proper bed.  She felt at once sleepy and disoriented, but also wonderful.  With every breath she could smell B'Elanna's marvelous spicy scent, and with her head resting on the Klingon's shoulder she could hear her hearts beating in a steady powerful rhythm.  She was perfectly content to lay in B'Elanna's arms and watch her sleep until the computer announced that it was time for them to get up.</p>
<p>When B'Elanna finally woke up she was amazed at the fact that she didn't feel awkward in the least lying here with Seven.  In fact it felt perfectly natural and perfectly wonderful.  </p>
<p>"Morning Seven."  B'Elanna tilted her head down to capture Seven's lips.  Seven eased her body on top of B'Elanna's and returned the kiss with a passion before settling back down in her lover's arms.  They lay snuggled together in the warmth of the bed for several minutes until B'Elanna kissed Seven one last time and reluctantly got up and made her way to the shower.</p>
<p>Seven stretched herself out slowly, loving the feeling of the bed beneath her.  She rolled over and was instantly enveloped in the warmth of B'Elanna's recently vacated spot on the bed. She stood up slowly, allowing her body time to adjust to the unfamiliar sensation of rising after a prolonged period of lying horizontally.  Her physiology quickly adjusted and she padded out into the living area, enjoying the feeling of the loose clothing moving over her body. </p>
<p>For the first time she allowed herself to explore B'Elanna's personal space.  There was a large Bat'leth hanging on one wall, and a small display of other Klingon weaponry below that.  There were also holopictures of several crewmembers including Ensign Kim and the Captain, and behind those pictures were several older ones that Seven assumed were of B'Elanna's family.  She recognized the face of B'Elanna's father from the holoprogram and assumed the older Klingon woman he was with was B'Elanna's mother.  There were a few other momentos scatter about the room, but the overall impression was of a spare and orderly life.  The only mess was the console that was littered with PADDs and a few assorted tools.  Looking about the room it was obvious that the driving force in B'Elanna's life was her job.  Seven approved of the engineer's single-minded focus on her job, but at the same time she felt a sadness that there wasn't more joy in B'Elanna's life. She smiled softly to herself thinking that perhaps that would change in the near future.</p>
<p>She walked to the replicator and began obtaining the necessary ingredients to make B'Elanna's favourite banana pancakes.  She was thoroughly engaged in her task and didn't notice that B'Elanna was in the room and had been watching her for several minutes.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, upon finishing her shower, had pulled on her uniform pants, boots and tank top, grabbed her tunic and had been about to enter the living area when she stopped, transfixed at the sight of Seven of Nine. The younger woman was still dressed in B'Elanna's old clothes, her hair loose and cascading over her face; she was carefully mixing ingredients in the cooking area.  Her concentration was evident by the sight of the tip of a small pink tongue protruding from the side of her mouth as she stirred what looked to B'Elanna like pancake batter.  She was beautiful, and B'Elanna had to remind herself to breathe.  She could not believe her luck at having found something this wonderful with someone as special as Seven of Nine. </p>
<p>Finally realizing that she couldn't just stand and stare all day, much as she'd like to, she stepped into the room and tossed her jacket over the back of the chair.  She moved behind Seven placing her hands on the drone's shapely hips and peered around her shoulder at what Seven was making.</p>
<p>"Mmm, is that banana pancake batter I smell?"</p>
<p>Seven merely nodded and continued her careful preparations.</p>
<p>"You didn't have to make me breakfast you know&#133;we could've gone to the messhall."</p>
<p>Seven leaned back into B'Elanna's body, enjoying the feel of the Klingon's firm muscles, more than capable of supporting her weight.  "I wished to make you something special to thank you for last night," she said shyly.</p>
<p>"Seven, sweetie, last night was special for me too, I should be thanking you."</p>
<p>Seven put down the bowl and turned to face B'Elanna, her blue eyes bored into the Klingon's, "Was it?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Was last night special for you&#133;I am unsure of what it meant to you."  The young Borg's fear and confusion was obvious, and B'Elanna pulled her into a warm embrace.</p>
<p>"Of course it was special, YOU are special.  Seven, listen to me, I would never do something like that with someone I didn't care for, and I would never toy with your affections like that.  This is exactly why I stopped us from going further than we did.  I know we have to talk, but we also have to get to work.  So listen carefully.  I care about you Seven, and I'm not going anywhere&#133;we are going to talk about this and figure out where we are going, together&#133;so please don't worry&#133;just try to be happy.  I know I am&#133;happy that is&#133;" The Klingon's uncharacteristic outburst of emotions left her rather drained and she buried her face in Seven's neck, feeling the young Borg's pulse pounding, she drew in a deep breath and savoured the intoxicating aroma of her lover.</p>
<p>Seven knew she could trust B'Elanna.  She instinctively knew that the Klingon's honour would prevent her from lying just to get out of an awkward situation, and she was thrilled to hear B'Elanna say that she cared and found her to be 'someone special.'  She held the young engineer closely for several minutes before lifting her head and bending to capture B'Elanna's lips in a searing kiss.  </p>
<p>"I believe you, and I wish you to know that I also care deeply for you."  Her nervousness at the unfamiliar situation caused her to fall back into Borg-speak, but to B'Elanna they were the sweetest words she'd ever heard.</p>
<p>"Well, now that that's settled you should jump in the shower and I'll finish up out here."</p>
<p>"But, I wished to make your breakfast for you," Seven protested.</p>
<p>"You already did the hard work.  I'll just heat up the pan and start making them while you get ready&#133;go on&#133;otherwise we'll be late for the meeting."</p>
<p>Seven reluctantly left for the shower.  She hated to remove the clothes B'Elanna had lent her, and she couldn't stop herself from bunching them up and burying her nose in the bundle, loving the way her scent and B'Elanna's mingled together on the clothing.  She then folded them carefully and placed them on the bed before entering the shower room.  </p>
<p>She was fascinated by the little bottles that B'Elanna kept in her bathroom.  She removed the cap from several of them and smelled the scented oils and lotions that were reminiscent of B'Elanna's own scent.  She knew she didn't have time to explore to her heart's content just now, so she replaced the bottles and stepped into the shower.</p>
<p>Seven emerged from the bedroom, once again clothed in her biosuit, and saw that B'Elanna had begun to set the table.  She stepped into the kitchen and took over making the last of the breakfast.  Cooking complete, they sat down and began to eat.</p>
<p>"These are delicious Seven, just like my Grandmother used to make."</p>
<p>Seven smiled at the praise and tentatively tried her first bite.  B'Elanna watched, amused, as Seven carefully put the tiny bite of pancake in her mouth and closed her eyes as she savoured the flavour.  A smile spread over her face and B'Elanna grinned as she saw the markedly increased size of Seven's next bite.</p>
<p>"I guess you like it huh?"</p>
<p>"It is <i>wonderful</i>, I had no idea that nutritional supplements could be this good.  Please pass the syrup B'Elanna."</p>
<p>B'Elanna obliged and laughed as Seven drowned her pancakes in the gooey liquid, and proceeded to devour her plateful. She also entertained several, rather erotic, thoughts as to what they could do with the syrup later. She loved to see Seven in unguarded moments like this, when she simply showed her emotions and didn't try to hide behind her cool Borg exterior.  She was so childlike in these moments that B'Elanna was always gripped with an urge to protect her.  She knew without a doubt that she would spill her last drop of blood before she would ever allow Seven to be hurt.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, they cleared the dishes away to be recycled.  As they worked B'Elanna noticed a drop of syrup still clinging to the side of Seven's mouth.  She reached up and wiped it gently away, surprised when Seven captured her finger and placed it in her mouth, gently sucking the last remnants of the sweet liquid from B'Elanna's finger.  "Mine," Seven declared.  'Oh, you have no idea,' B'Elanna thought to herself as Seven unwitting quoted a line from the Klingon mating ritual.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's knees nearly gave way at the heartstopping sensation of having her finger suddenly pulled into the warm and sensuous mouth of Seven of Nine.  She grabbed the young drone's shoulder for support while she regained her equilibrium, and then, as Seven released her finger, she cupped the beautiful young woman's chin in her hand and kissed her, gently at first and then more deeply as she tried to convey all that she was feeling without words.  It was Seven's turn to require support, and B'Elanna gave it willingly.</p>
<p>They reluctantly broke apart, still in a gentle embrace, content for now to simply smile at one another.</p>
<p>"We really should get going to the meeting Seven or we're going to be late.  Just, please remember that I'm here for you and that everything is going to be all right. OK?"  B'Elanna looked deeply into her lover's eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you&#133;I believe I will 'miss you' today," Seven began shyly.</p>
<p>"Well, you know you're always welcome in engineering."</p>
<p>Seven cocked her optical implant at B'Elanna's statement.  "Indeed&#133;I seem to remember a certain Chief Engineer threatening to make me a part of the ship's hull if I ever touched her precious engines again&#133;That was you was it not, or is my eidetic memory failing me?" </p>
<p>"I, uh, right&#133;but there are other things to do in engineering besides touch my precious engines.  There are several tool lockers that need to be assimilated into some sense of order," B'Elanna grinned.</p>
<p>"I believe that you are lucky we need to depart for the morning meeting right now or the tool lockers are not all that might be 'assimilated,'" Seven's smile belied the stern voice she used to deliver her comment.</p>
<p>"Well then, we don't want to be late do we," B'Elanna said, grasping Seven's shoulders and planting one last kiss on those luscious lips before fast-walking out of her quarters, snagging her jacket from the chair as she went, leaving a slightly dazed drone to scurry after her departing form.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The meeting went as expected, engineering was running at peak efficiency. Food and dilithium stores were at acceptable levels, and sensor sweeps of the area had detected nothing of interest for the next several hundred light years. Life was good in the Delta quadrant.  Sensor sweeps of the conference room however, would have picked up a curious anomaly&#133;that being the Chief Astrometrics officer and the Chief Engineer holding hands under the table throughout the entire meeting.  Life in the Delta quadrant was indeed good!</p>
<p>After the meeting broke up Seven and B'Elanna parted ways and B'Elanna headed to engineering to say good morning to her beloved warp core.  After ensuring that the ship was not suffering any ill effects from being replaced as number one in her affections, she buried herself in some long overdue paperwork.  </p>
<p>For once she was looking forward to lunch in the messhall as she was certain to see Seven there.  She was terribly disappointed when the lovely blonde failed to appear.  B'Elanna waited as long as she could in good conscience, but eventually had to leave without seeing the object of her affections. As she rode the turbolift back to engineering she contemplated calling Seven over the comm to see if everything was Ok, but decided that if Seven was busy she might not appreciate a call just to 'chat.'</p>
<p>When she got back to engineering she ran a few diagnostics from the console on the main floor, and noticed a slight phase variance in one of the plasma injectors.  She was concentrating so hard on her attempts to isolate the problem that she didn't hear the sound of someone walk up beside her to observe her work.</p>
<p>She was startled, therefore, to see a mesh encased hand enter her field of view, pointing to the console screen, as a familiar patrician voice began to speak, "I believe if you compensate for rate of flow in the coil here, you will be able to overcome the variance."</p>
<p>A familiar flash of anger at the drone's self-confident speech flared and was instantly gone, replaced with her happiness at seeing Seven again.  "Nuh uh Seven, already tried that&#133;no joy." For several minutes they worked in silence, two pairs of hands flying over the console screen, working together on a problem.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was enjoying the closeness; she could feel the heat radiating off of Seven's body.  Finally, still working, she shifted her weight toward the young drone, bumping their hips together in a playful hipcheck before asking, "So, Seven do you want to do something tonight&#133;Maybe go to Sandrine's or take a walk in the airponics bay?"</p>
<p>Seven smiled to herself as she had come down here with the sole purpose of finding an activity to engage in with B'Elanna this evening.  She had had a plan of her own, but decided that it would wait, and she agreed to meet B'Elanna in the messhall for dinner before going to Sandrine's.  They worked together for several more moments until the phase variance was back in line, an event marked by B'Elanna's triumphant "YES!"  She grinned up at the younger woman and said, "See, I told you we'd make a great team Seven."</p>
<p>Seven's only answer was a raised implant and an indulgent smile.  "I will see you tonight at 1800 B'Elanna." The Chief engineer's eyes never left her gently swaying form as Seven walked out of engineering.  </p>
<p>Having found one problem in the warp core B'Elanna decided that a thorough set of analyses was in order, and she promptly set about running them.  She was engrossed in her work when she heard a sound that was completely out of place in engineering.  She turned quickly in time to see several familiar blue sparkling figures begin to emerge out of thin air, right onto the main floor of engineering.</p>
<p>She was in horror as the transporter beams began to take shape in the form of large green aliens with a type of scaled armour covering their bodies.  Her hand flew to her Comm badge.</p>
<p>&lt;Intruder Alert! I need a Security team in Engineering. There are at least&#133;. &gt;</p>
<p>Her words were cut off by a blow to the head delivered from behind. She fell soundlessly to the deck plating.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Just as B'Elanna's words rang out on the bridge, Harry Kim noticed something on his console that had not been there a second ago.  Tuvok was already heading for the turbolift when he stopped at Ensign Kim's words.</p>
<p>"There is a ship 50,000 kilometers off the port bow&#133;it wasn't there a second ago.  They must have some kind of cloaking device."  There was a brief pause as the bridge crew digested his words. "They are powering weapons and preparing to fire."</p>
<p>"Red Alert, All hands to battle stations." The captain's voice came over the comm and all members of Voyager's crew stopped what they were doing and moved to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>"Shields up," Chakotay's voice snapped.</p>
<p>"I, I can't sir, We've been locked out of shield control.  I'm trying to reroute the command subroutines and gain access now." Kim's hands were flying over the console in an attempt to gain back control of the ship.</p>
<p>"Evasive maneuvers Gamma 1 Mr. Paris," the captain spoke again.</p>
<p>"They are firing. Full spread&#133;Direct hit.  We have hull breaches on deck 7, 10, and 16."</p>
<p>"Seal them&#133;. Get us out of here Mr. Paris."</p>
<p>"We don't have Warp engines Captain," Paris groaned as he attempted to maneuver away from the attacking ship.</p>
<p>&lt;Bridge to Engineering&gt;</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>&lt;Janeway to Torres. &gt;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kim, what is the status of Engineering?"</p>
<p>"I don't know Captain, I no longer have access to the controls, and I believe all comms have been cut to that area."</p>
<p>"Keep trying."</p>
<p>"Aye Captain."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Seven's first impulse on hearing the Red Alert called was to go to engineering to ensure that B'Elanna was safe, but her overriding sense of duty wouldn't allow it.  She headed to the bridge and as she exited the turbolift and saw the ship on the viewscreen her heart fell.</p>
<p>"Species 1327, the Hakari.  They are scavengers.  They have cloaking technology stolen from other species as well as disrupter type weapons.  They will attempt to gain access to main engineering and take over the ship from within so as not to damage any valuable systems.  They will not hesitate to kill the crew."  Seven gave her brief dispassionate report as she moved to the secondary Ops station.  Her heart stopped beating as she saw that engineering was already cut off from the rest of the ship. 'B'Elanna!' was all she could think.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>B'Elanna's head felt like it was going to split open.  She slowly opened her eyes and without moving glanced at as much of engineering as she could see.  There were several of the aliens in her view&#133;all engaged at the consoles.  With agonizing slowness, she coiled her body and in one swift motion sprang to her feet, grabbing the nearest intruder around the neck.  She twisted with all her strength and felt the satisfying crunch of neck bones breaking.</p>
<p>Still holding the lifeless body she faced the next challenge.  The phaser bolt he fired was absorbed by the body she held like a shield in front of her.  She grabbed the weapon of her victim and fired twice, taking down two more of the aliens.  Dragging the lifeless body she moved backward to a relatively covered area of engineering.  Holding the weapon in one hand she accessed the console to see what damage had been done.</p>
<p>The first thing she tried to do was unlock the doors to engineering, but she quickly realized it would take too long to break the encryption codes that had been placed on them.  'Tuvok will just have to blast his way in she thought,' as she began the job of getting warp speed restored to her ship.</p>
<p>Several phaser bolts fizzled around her and she looked up, firing at the intruders who were attempting to neutralize her.  One of them took a direct hit and felt from the second floor onto the deck with a muffled thud.  She fired several more times to keep the attackers occupied while she went back to work.  She continued working feverishly, returning fire as needed.  She was relieved to hear the sounds of the security team working away at the door.</p>
<p>She had managed to gain back control of the comm system, and shields, but to bring the warp core back online she was going to have to make a run for the main console.  She decided to wait until the doors to engineering were breached so that she would have a better chance of making it in all the confusion.  'Hurry up guys,' she thought to herself as the noise outside increased.</p>
<p>Finally, with a loud blast, and a flash of light the doors were blown open and the security team came pouring in.  'Now or never,' she thought to herself as she ran to the centre of the room, firing as she went.  She accessed the controls and entered the commands, and Voyager was back under the control of the bridge.  She spun around to assist the security team in eradicating the last of the intruders.  She never even saw the phaser bolt as it tore into her chest.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>On the bridge Paris was trying his best to minimize damage to the ship by executing every evasive maneuver he could think of.  Even with his skill they had taken several more direct hits.</p>
<p>"Shields are back on line."</p>
<p>"Good job Mr. Kim," the captain commended.</p>
<p>"It wasn't me," Harry replied.</p>
<p>Seven took heart at his words.  There was only one person she knew of who was capable of getting control of engineering back that quickly.  B'Elanna was alright, at least for now.</p>
<p>With shields back in place Tom had a bit more breathing room and for now they were escaping heavy damage.  Everyone knew, however, if they didn't get weapons or warp drive back soon nothing else was going to matter.</p>
<p>There were several reports of intruders throughout the ship and armed security teams were engaged in skirmishes in several locations.  </p>
<p>"Captain the warp engines are back on line."</p>
<p>"Get us out of here Mr. Paris, maximum warp, any course for now."</p>
<p>Voyager blurred into a beam of light and disappeared from the viewscreen of the enemy vessel.  They didn't have the technology to track the ship down, and they had taken heavy losses in this battle.  They turned their ship around and began to search for easier prey.</p>
<p>"Casualty and damage reports are coming in now Captain," Harry spoke up in the silence that ensued their remarkable escape.  "The security teams have all the intruders in custody.  There is heavy damage to engineering.  Weapons are still offline.  We have 25 injured in sickbay right now, and 3 casualties.  Crewman Rhys, Ensign Johnson, and&#133;Oh God no&#133;Lieutenant Torres."</p>
<p>A stunned silence followed Harry's revelation.  The captain covered her face with her hands and fought for control as she thought of the young woman who had come so far since she joined this crew.  Even Tom Paris looked ill.  He was as aware as anyone else on the bridge that only B'Elanna could have restored the warp engines that saved all of their lives.</p>
<p>Seven of Nine was fighting for control.  This could not be happening.  She was holding onto the console with such strength that the Plexan surface cracked under the pressure.  Tears began to stream down her face, and she fell to one knee, no longer able to stand.  Harry was at her side in an instant.  He had seen how close the two had become in the past few weeks.  He managed to put his own grief at the death of his friend aside for a moment as he helped Seven to her feet.</p>
<p>"Come on Seven, you need to get out of here.  Captain, permission to leave the bridge."</p>
<p>The captain, who still had not taken in the enormity of what had happened, didn't speak.  Instead Chakotay gave permission for Seven and Harry to go.</p>
<p>They entered the turbolift and Seven sobbed, "I need to see her, please, take me to her."</p>
<p>Harry tapped his comm badge and inquired of the computer as to the location of Lieutenant Torres. A second later he could have kicked himself as the computer, of course, informed them that Lieutenant Torres was not aboard the ship.  Seven began sobbing anew, and Harry attempted to comfort her as he called sickbay to ask if B'Elanna had been taken there.  They could hear the pandemonium in sickbay over the comm; a medic informed them tersely that B'Elanna was indeed there.</p>
