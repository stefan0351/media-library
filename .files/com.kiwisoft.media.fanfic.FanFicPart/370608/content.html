<p>Well hello everyone! At last I have perfected, to the best of my ability, yet another chapter of this small tale, which my generous mind has been continuously supplying material for. I wish it would do this more often! Thanks so much to everyone who has reviewed and added this story to their alerts or favorites. It really means a lot to me! I hope I can continue to live up to your expectations. R&R!</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>The music was pounding from all directions. It was impossible to tell where it was coming from, or even where the DJ table was because of all the people surrounding us, jumping, swaying, and moving to the beat. Lights were flashing, purple, white, blue and green. The atmosphere was intoxicating. What ever song had just been playing ended and dissolved smoothy into the next, it sounded familiar, but my brain had just stopped working because Viola had started to dance. Swaying her hips gently at first and then turning it into something completely different, oh, and another thing, she still hadn't let go of my hand, and this time, she didn't seem to have any intent of doing that any time soon.</p>
<p>She slid into the rhythm with ease, moving her hips in a way that was so sexy I almost forgot to breath. She stepped easily from side to side, her eyes closed, it was as if she had melted into the music. Her eyes suddenly opened and she grinned at me slyly, then maintaining steady eye contact she grabbed my other hand so that we were dancing together, moving to the beat as one. We were close, so close. Dropping one hand she spun me around, then pulled me towards her again. I giggled and she grinned, then she turned smoothly so that her back was to me and not letting go of my hand moved back ward slightly so that our bodies were pressed against each other.</p>
<p><i>Oh God. We're grinding, we're actually grinding.</i></p>
<p>After this though, my brain shut off completely and I became unable to finish any coherent thoughts, because she had placed my hands on her hips, all the while keeping our fingers linked, helping me guide her hips as they moved over mine. Our rhythm was perfect and it was like our bodies were meant to fit together like that. The friction we were creating was driving me crazy. I felt myself starting to get hot, really hot, in one specific area that is. I mean, hey, if you had the hottest girl in school's ass pressed up against your... erm, area... You'd be having control problems as well! I silently thanked god that I wasn't a boy.</p>
<p>Suddenly Andrew appeared in front of us, scaring me half to death, and started to say something. I was a bit embarrassed by what he had caught us doing, but when he didn't react at all and Vi didn't act like we had been doing anything wrong, I relaxed. Viola stopped moving and took a step towards him to hear what he was saying. I could have killed him then and there. But Viola still didn't drop my hand which I took as a good sign.</p>
<p>Once Andrew finished talking, he pointed off in some direction and Vi nodded and turned back to me.</p>
<p>"Andrew was wondering if we were drunk enough to go play spin the bottle, you up for it?" She flashed me a cocky grin.</p>
<p>"Sure, yeah, why not?" I replied. "Lead the way."</p>
<p>Viola turned and led me through the crowd in the direction Andrew had been pointing. I was a bit upset about leaving my personal heaven, but was intrigued by the opportunities this game could bring about.</p>
<p>We passed through a door way and made our way down a wide hall, before reaching another open space which looked like a sort of living room, with couches and chairs and such. The music was muffled, but could still be heard, and there was the loud buzz of peoples voices filling the room. For the purposes of the party this space seemed to have been turned into the designated spin the bottle room, I also thought I saw a couple strip poker games going on, or maybe that was just a couple of people undressing each other, I didn't really have time to analyze it because we had reached the group Andrew seemed to have been playing with.</p>
<p>Duke was there and so was Maria, as well as some other people from school who looked familiar, but I couldn't remember any names. Part of me wondered why Andrew had taken the time to come and find us, but now was not the time to be thinking too much. We sat down and the game began.</p>
<p>Andrew spun first, it rotated a couple of times before landing on some cute girl sitting across from him. He gave her a sheepish smile and leaned forward, she did the same, meeting him half way, and they shared a short, chaste kiss. Every one in the group booed, and they just mumbled excuses sitting back down embarrassed. One of the group members spoke up.</p>
<p>"Okay, new rule, kiss must last longer than 30 seconds."</p>
<p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Now it was Maria's turn, she gave the bottle a good hard spin and it flung around feverishly before coming to rest on Duke.</p>
<p>She shot him a smile before leaning forward and pressing her lips against his. This was definitely a better show. At first Duke was almost completely unresponsive, but after a moment he began to loosen up and kiss her back. It got to the point where a full minute had passed and neither of them seemed like they would be stopping anytime soon. There was a flash of tongue and I heard Viola clear her throat and looked over at her, slightly alarmed that she was upset by this, but was relieved to see that she was smiling, and looked as if she was trying hard not to laugh.</p>
<p>The sound seemed to have done its job however, and woken up the couple out of their trance, for they were both blushing profusely when they sat back down.</p>
<p><i>Well that was interesting. </i>I thought.</p>
<p>Next was some guy who I didn't really know the name of, but had seen around campus before, I was pretty sure he was on the soccer team. He gave the bottle a weak little spin and it turned lazily before pointing directly at Andrew.</p>
<p>They both moved forward, their faces conveying almost no emotion, and their lips met.</p>
<p><i>Hm. </i>I thought, as both boys kissed each other quite gently for a good thirty seconds, before sitting back down and smiling shyly. I wondered what that was about, it was almost like they had done that before. But I became distracted as I realized something else.</p>
<p>It was my turn.</p>
<p>I leaned forward and put my hand on the bottle, took a deep breath and gave it good hard spin. In my mind, it looked like it was rotating in slow motion, passing by each person, threatening to stop each time, before finally coming to rest on the person sitting by my side. I felt my breath catch, I couldn't believe it, it was too good to be true.</p>
<p>I looked shyly over at the girl who was seated to my left, almost afraid to meet her eyes. But once I had, I couldn't tear my gaze away from that beautiful shade of green, my mind instantly becoming lost in a forest of emotions, I knew I wouldn't be able to escape. Ever so slowly the eyes began to get bigger, green becoming the only thing I could see, until I glanced down and caught sight of her full, succulent, perfect, cherry red lips. I could feel her warm breath on my face, as gentle and sweet as the summer breeze. The tension was almost too much to bare, being so close, so close, so tormentingly, painfully, wonderfully close. And then, there was no space between us at all.</p>
<p>I felt my lips press up against hers, and it was like fireworks had started going off in the back of my head, but they were muffled fireworks, because a wonderfully warm and soft sensation had drifted over my being. And all I could think about was how unbelievably soft she is. I suddenly began to feel her lips come alive against mine, moving in a way that was almost hungry, as if a powerful desire, long kept hidden, had been brought to the surface. I eagerly responded, my lips holding their own against this new found aggression. Then I felt something that snapped what was left of my control, her tongue slid over my bottom lip, begging for entrance, which I instantly granted her. Her hot, saliva coated tongue slid into my mouth, sending a shiver of pleasure down my spine and a small moan escapes from deep in the back of my throat. My tongue moved forward to meet hers, forcing her out of my mouth and back into her own, a steady rhythm establishes between us. I lift my hand to trail my fingers over her cheek, before reaching back and tangle them into her long soft brown hair. A new sensation sends a thrill through by body, as I feel her fingers brush against my thigh. She bit down lightly on my lip, the action sending a small electric wave straight to my core.</p>
<p><i>You know you want her, </i>a voice in my head seemed to hiss. <i>You want her sooooo bad. </i></p>
<p>I let out another small moan and allowed the hand not tangled in her hair to begin to wander.</p>
<p>A sudden noise caused me to freeze. My mind, which had been completely over come, slowly began to work again. My eyes flicked open and I pulled away with a start, not able to believe what had just happened. Viola looked similarly dazed. Her eyes were dark and filled with lust, her breathing, like mine, was ragged and uneven. I felt as though I should look away, feeling unbelievably embarrassed, but, like before, I couldn't bring myself to look away from this goddess of beauty. Who, if I was not mistaken, had just made out with me.</p>
<p>Viola was the first to speak. Without taking her eyes off me, she said slowly, "Will you excuse us." She then grabbed my hand and pulled me swiftly out of the room.</p>
<p><hr size=1 noshade>Well... What did you think? Finally a little heat right? I might have to consider changing the rating back, depending on where this goes... It would be great if I could get peoples input on whether or not to take this to the next level. Sorry for the rating confusion! Im trying to figure it out! But your help would be much appreciated! Love you all, and expect another update soon! THANKS! :D</p>
