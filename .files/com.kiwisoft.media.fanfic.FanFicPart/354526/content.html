<p>"Why have you come," asked the first oracle.</p>

<p>"What is it you seek," asked the second.</p>

<p>"I come because a warlock called Ciarán has kidnapped The Watcher and
one slayers Mom and harmed the other slayer.  I need to know what is
going on and how I can help them," replied Angel as he presented the
Oracles with a complete set of motivational lithographs.</p>

<p>"These are nice pictures,"</p>

<p>"Yes, nice indeed.  So you wish to know of the warlock Ciarán"</p>

<p> "He is a very dangerous foe, who seeks to make a even deadlier ally."</p>

<p>"He must be stopped before the ally can be brought through the
Hellmouth or the Outer Earth will be consumed in darkness as the wars
begin again."</p>

<p>"What is that suppose to mean," inquired Angel as he tried to
decipher what the oracles where saying. </p>

<p>"Go to the Ultimate Slayer and the Mage, they will know," replied the
first oracle.</p>

<p>"When you see them, you must tell them that the warlock has aligned
himself with the Demon Prince," replied the second.</p>

<p>Before Angel could ask the oracles anymore he found himself back in
his LA office.  He looked to Cordelia who was waiting for him, "It
looks like we are going to have to go to Sunnydale."</p>

<p>Giles and Joyce both awoke to find themselves bond and gagged in
chairs facing one another, in what appeared to be the main room of a
cabin.  </p>

<p>"I see your finally up Rupert," Replied Ethan as he walked over to
the couple, "tell me how does it feel to know you have lost."</p>

<p>Ethan let at out a loud chuckle, "I almost forgot, you are unable to
speak right now."</p>

<p>"Quite teasing my prisoners and prepare for the ceremony," demanded
Ciarán as he walked into the room carrying the book Fey had sent to
Giles.  The warlock then walked over to Giles and tossed the book in
his lap, "A very interesting book you have there, at least now I know
who it is that stands against me.  Now it is only a matter of getting
an ally to distract the void so I can grab the power of the
Hellmouth," replied  Ciarán as he pointed to a makeshift alter in the
far corner of the room, "The ceremony tonight should take care of
that, unfortunately when it is over I will no longer be in need of
your services."  </p>

<p>Ciarán removed the restraints from Giles and Joyce and motioned for
Ethan to take them to the cellar, "Enjoy yourself Rupert, for the two
of you do not have much time left on this earth."</p>

<p>Tara sat in the circle chanting as she reached out beyond the earth
Realms into the Ethereal.  </p>

<p>"What is wrong child?" inquired Fey</p>

<p>"It's the warlock, He injured the second slayer, and Kidnapped The
Watcher and the Ultimate Slayers mother."</p>

<p>"I was afraid something like this might happen.  How are the slayers
new powers?"</p>

<p>"She is still learning, she has already discovered her new physical
abilities but has yet to unleash the full potential of her mind."</p>

<p>"I see, what of the young mage?"</p>

<p>"She still hasn't discovered her nature, and relies heavily on spoken
magic."</p>

<p>Fey sighed, "This is not good, the warlock seeks an ally in the Demon
Prince if that happens we will need them both at their full
potential, other wise Outer Earth could be lost."</p>

<p>"What can I do to help," inquired Tara.</p>

<p>"I am going to go before the Powers that Be and ask for there help.
I need you to return to the slayer and the mage and prepare them for
the journey to the Upper Ethereal."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p> "How is she," asked Willow as she entered the room where Buffy was
tending to Faith.</p>

<p>"Not good, she's not healing like she should."</p>

<p>Willow walked over to Buffy and placed her hand on her lovers
shoulders, "What do you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean most of the smaller cuts and bruises should be gone by now
but they're not, for some reason her bodies not using her slayer
healing abilities."</p>

<p>Willow sat down on Buffy's lap and wrapped her arm around her, "Don't
worry we'll figure something out," she reassured her companion.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can help," replied Tara who had been silently waiting for
the two of them to finish talking.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the blonde immortal and pondered if she wanted the
girls help.  She knew that Tara was there to help them but the girl
had dated Willow for a whole year when it should have been her and
she was finding that difficult to forgive.</p>

<p>Tara sensed Buffy's apprehension in wanting her help and knew that
she was to blame for it, "B-Buffy...I know that my actions in the
past have caused you pain but there is nothing I can do to change
that....I would only ask that you forgive me and realize that I mean
only to help the two of you."</p>

<p>Willow leaned over and kissed the slayer on the cheek, "It's OK
Sweetheart, you can trust her."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at the redhead before turning her attention back to
Tara, "OK, Tell me what's  wrong with Faith."</p>

<p>"Her wounds are not healing the way they should because the damage is
magical in nature.  Unlike you, she is only a regular slayer, her
natural abilities are not enough to overcome the magic."</p>

<p>"Can the two of us heal her," inquired Willow.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I will do it.  You and Buffy have more pressing matters."</p>

<p>Both the girls looked at Tara in puzzlement, "What is that suppose to
mean," asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Fey has gone to the Powers That Be on your behalf, if all goes well
you will be going to the upper Ethereal soon."</p>

<p>Willow's eyes grew real wide, "But that's the home of the.....Gods
and Goddesses."</p>

<p>"Yes....it is."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy and Willow felt their mind's cloud over for a moment, before
finding themselves standing side by side in a sacred grove.  Before
them stood an enchanting young woman with long flowing hair, she
seemed almost translucent to the two of them.  The woman floated
gracefully over next to them, "Fear not Warrior of Light, We mean no
harm to you or your soul mate."</p>

<p>"Who are you," inquired a very nervous slayer.</p>

<p>"I am called Brigid."</p>

<p>"Y-y-your the....G-goddess," stammered Willow.</p>

<p>The Goddess smiled at the two of them, "Yes I am, please join me over
by the brook we have much to talk about."</p>

<p>When the three of them reached the brook Buffy protectively wrapped
her arms around Willow, and demanded, "What do you want with us."</p>

<p>"Buffy try to be a little more polite, she's the Goddess," whispered
Willow.</p>

<p>The Goddess gently smiled at them and spoke in the most comforting
voice either one of them had ever heard, "It is all right young mage,
your lover means no malice or disrespect, it is the protective nature
of the warrior of light and her love for you that cause her actions
here."</p>

<p>The Goddess then stood directly in front of Buffy, "I come to you as
the head of the Powers that Be, to show you both your full potential,
it is the only way you will be able to fight the warlock and win."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ciarán stood in jet black robes before the alter, "Achin Wer Zorin
Ta. Tursa God of Darkness I call upon thy name.   Xa Ner JI Zor.
Grant me an ally in my task so that I might serve thy cause.  Mala
Tore Vena."</p>

<p>A thick cloud of red smoke filled the room and a voice boomed from
it, "I am Laoise, Lord of Demons.  Why have you awakened me?"</p>
