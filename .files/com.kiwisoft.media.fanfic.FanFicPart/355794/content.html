<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Eighteen -->

<p>It was pure torture for Gage to drag herself out of bed the next morning. But when the other half of her soul slipped from their warm haven, the emptiness left behind motivated her to get moving.
			<i> After all, the kids will be up soon. I guess it was silly of me to think we could just lounge around in bed all day. </i>Gage tracked Lacy as she walked across the room, well out of reach, only to exit mumbling something about getting something to eat. That thought appealed to the writer in a very perverse way. Thinking of what she'd like to devour, Gage reprimanded herself.
			<i>I have got to get my mind out of the gutter.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Lacy, with a firm handle on getting breakfast ready, spun the knob on the stove, cranked the heat up under the pot of water warming for the oatmeal. </p>
		<p>Gage approached silently from behind, slipped her arms around the star's slender waist. She pulled Lacy close to her, molding their bodies together. Lacy allowed herself a moment to savor this feeling of love permeating her entire being, closing her eyes. The writer dispensed a series of kisses on the actresses neck then kissing her way up, slowly dragging the tip of her tongue along the edge of Lacy's ear. A tantalizing tingle shot through the dark haired woman. After a brief stay playing with Lacy's ear, Gage's chin came to rest on the actresses shoulder.</p>
		<p>Lacy clasped her hands on the arms circling her waist. "That was nice."</p>
		<p>Gage perked up. "What is it with you? Everything is....nice?" Gage taunted with a serious edge of undercurrent flowing through her tone.</p>
		<p>Twisting around in the writer's arms, Lacy touched Gage's cheek, gazing deeply into the profound verdant eyes before her. "Would you rather I use great, wonderful, excellent, outstanding or.....what would you suggest?"</p>
		<p>"Sexy, sensual, superior, stupendous to name a few." </p>
		<p>"Okay, you're wanting something that starts with an ?s'. It was....." An impious grin crossed her face. "Super nice." </p>
		<p>"You are wicked. You know that, don't you?" Gage claimed the lips being offered, drowning in the delicious taste of heaven. Gage put all the love she had for Lacy in that kiss, aiming for something beyond ?nice' even if it was described as super.
			<i>I'm thinking more like marvelous, out of this world, fabulous, awe-inspiring or......</i>
		</p>
		<p>Breaking from the kiss, Lacy declared breathlessly. "Breathtaking."</p>
		<p>
			<i>That's more like it. </i> Gage reclaimed the star's beckoning lips, spiraling, falling over the precipice into a seductive haze. Until. The boiling water bubbled over the pot, sizzling on the heat below, jerking them out of their revelry.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy twisted out of Gage's embrace, grabbed the pot then sat it down on an empty burner. Rotating back around to the writer, Lacy revealed. "Apparently, I love you to distraction."</p>
		<p>Her simply stated words shocked Gage to the core. She was about to proclaim the love she felt for the woman standing before her until soft footfalls could be heard from the hardwood floor in the hallway. They both stepped back awkwardly. </p>
		<p>Rubbing his sleepy eyes, Derek dragged the giraffe behind him into the kitchen. "Momma." </p>
		<p>"Morning, honey." Lacy swung her son up in her arms. "You hungry?"</p>
		<p>Barely holding onto the giraffe's horn, Derek nodded, wiggling his friend. "He hungry too."</p>
		<p>The sharp shriek of a whistle cut through the morning air. Lacy and Gage practically jumped at the noise of Dani's whistle while Derek just giggled. "Good morning." Dani announced, her voice a little raspy. "What's for breakfast? Captain Crunch?"</p>
		<p>Gage placed a bowl of oatmeal before Dani, but said to Lacy. "I guess the captain here is planning an excursion today."</p>
		<p>"Honey, what's wrong with your voice?" The concerned mother felt her daughter's forehead for fever.</p>
		<p>"Nothing." Dani croaked. "Just a little sore."</p>
		<p>"Mmmm. Maybe must be from all that bloodcurdling screaming you did in the haunted house." Lacy said, giving her a cough drop. "Here."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy hoped to find some time to talk with Gage about the recent developments between them, but they had to tend to the kids first.
			<i>Maybe tonight. </i>A silent exchange of looks between writer and star aligned them on the same wavelength.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Alright then. After breakfast, we'll sail the high seas. Maybe go over to the public beach. Derek will like the playground they have there. Swimming, fishing, games later." Gage was quickly filling up the agenda for the day.</p>
		<p>
			<i>That's it, Gage, a full day of activities for our young brood and they'll be all tuckered out and go to bed extra early. </i>"And if we need to...a long walk."
		</p>
		<p>Dani scrunched her face. "A walk?" Then shrugged. "Okay, if we walk to the cave, that is."</p>
		<p>Lacy cocked her hands on her hips. "No cave. We already did that." She had no desire to make that trek again even though their last expedition brought them back safe and sound. </p>
		<p>Dani caved. "Okay, no cave. Jeez." Unbeknownst to everyone in the room expect for Derek, a devious thought bloomed as a smile widened at the prospect.
			<i>Where there's a will, there's a way. </i>Dani quoted her father. Of course, her father only used that affirmation when it came to his work.
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The full day of activities did the trick. Two very tired children crawled into bed, safely tucked in, falling easily as sleep claimed them. Lacy and Gage returned to the living room intent on further exploring their feelings toward each other.</p>
		<p>Before even one word was spoken, the telephone rang. Gage shrugged, reached for the telephone and answered it. "Hello." A brief moment passed before she handed the telephone to Lacy, sitting next her.</p>
		<p>Lacy grabbed it. "Hello."</p>
		<p>"How's my favorite client?" Arthur Graham asked, nervously tapping his pencil against the script he'd just finished reading.</p>
		<p>"Oh, hello Art." Lacy mouthed ?my agent' to Gage. "We're fine here. Having a great time actually." The star said with a smile and a wink to Gage. Scooting closer, Gage wrapped her arms around Lacy's shoulders. "What's up?"</p>
		<p>"Not a thing. Just wanted to touch base." Arthur said nonchalantly. </p>
		<p>"Ummm Hmm. Why don't I believe that?" Lacy was always suspicious when her agent called ?to touch base'. The underlining message usually meant trouble.</p>
		<p>"You've got my number." Arthur cleared his throat. He knew Lacy, unlike other clients, didn't like beating around the bush. "I heard a crazy rumor."</p>
		<p>"You mean the divorce." Lacy stated simply.</p>
		<p>"What! What divorce?" The ball came out of left field and hit him squarely on his balding head. "Where's David?"</p>
		<p>"In California, I'm sure." Lacy wished she'd have waited for her agent to deliver his news before she had to undertake this subject with him. "He wants a divorce, brought the papers out here a few days ago. I signed. End of story."</p>
		<p>"You already gave me the end, now I want the beginning. When did this happen?" Arthur was bordering on the edge of becoming frantic. It wasn't that he liked David so much. Together they made a powerful couple in Hollywood. And from an agent's point of view, his client was served up better opportunities and had the inside track with a producer for a husband. Of course, being married to one of the most beautiful women in the world who also just happened to be a great actress bode well for the up and coming producer.</p>
		<p>"At first, I'd have said it came out of nowhere when he showed up with the papers, but upon further reflection, I'd say it started around four years ago. Slowly but surely our marriage eroded along the way. And then there's Hayston." Lacy added.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Hayston! </i>Arthur Graham found out purely by accident about a year ago that David was having an affair with Hayston. He debated time and time again about telling Lacy, hoping that David would tire of the demanding actress. Arthur always pictured Hayston Rawlings sharpening her nails at the break of dawn before emerging from her dark abyss preying on anyone who could further her career. The twenty-three year old actress learned the Hollywood ropes quickly, coiling some of her own as she played the game with expertise.
		</p>
		<p>Silence on the telephone line prompted Lacy. "Arthur. You still there."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that." Arthur knew his thirty-year-old client was, even at that age, all too trusting. Lacy tended to take things at face value. "Are you sure it has to come to this?"</p>
		<p>"Is this about my career?"</p>
		<p>"No! I'm concerned about you, that's all." He assured her.</p>
		<p>"I'll be fine. Divorce isn't something new in Hollywood. It happens all time." Darting her eyes to Gage who locked onto the loving green gaze like a port in a storm. "Believe me." A long slender finger traveled down Gage's jaw line, sending shivers through her. </p>
		<p>"If you say so." Sucking in a deep breath. "There's something else. And it is about your career."</p>
		<p>Lacy waited.</p>
		<p>"I got a call. Anonymous. But for some reason, it sounds legit. They knew where you are and described your kids. The caller said that you've.... you are engaged in....oh, hell, Lacy. They saw you kissing a woman and say they have pictures. And while this may not be new in Hollywood, it doesn't happen all the time. Careers take a nasty and, may I say, hasty nose dive on something like this."</p>
		<p>"Are they blackmailing me?" Lacy asked. At these words, Gage's smiling eyes turned cold.</p>
		<p>"No. Said they thought I should know before the world did. Their words." Arthur made a decision. "I'm here for you, Lacy. No matter what."</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Art." </p>
		<p>If Art had wanted her to confirm or deny this accusation, he didn't ask. He respected her and stifled the question on the tip of his tongue. "I know you planned to stay there another few weeks, but it seems someone has been keeping close watch on your.....activities."</p>
		<p>"It appears so." Lacy admitted. "Art, how far reaching would something like this be?"</p>
		<p>"That depends on what this mysterious caller does. If they actually got pictures ...trouble or if it's just a rumor, it will blow over until something better comes along. You know how Hollywood is." Art said. "However, if it's true and you decide to go public.....I'm afraid.... To be honest, Lacy, I don't know. Things have come a long way." But that hint of society's promising acceptance died on his lips.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Art. I plan on staying here unless my.....spy, stalker, whatever tries something. You will let me know if anything else comes up."</p>
		<p>"Will do." With these words, Art placed the telephone back on its cradle, walked to the window and regurgitated the content of the mystery call once again.</p>
		<p>While talking with her agent, Gage noticed Lacy shift slightly back away from her embrace. The phone call over, Lacy fell into deep thought. Finally, Lacy related the content of the call to Gage.</p>
		<p>"Worried about your career?"</p>
		<p>"I'm not so much worried about my career. My kids, however, and how it will affect them is paramount on my mind. It's not just about us, but the divorce, everything. Dani adores her father." Downcast blue eyes refused to meet concerned green ones. "It had to be last night at the fair when we kissed."</p>
		<p>"I know." Gage bolted off the couch. "Damn it, there was a moment last night when I felt someone was watching us." A reflective pause. "But I...I got sidetracked."</p>
		<p>Even through the turmoil of the news that spun around in Lacy's head, Gage's admission brought a smile to the star's face. "Gage, it's late and I need to think. Do you mind?"</p>
		<p>"No, not at all. You want to go to bed?" Offered innocently.</p>
		<p>Shifting her eyes away from the writer's intense look. "I think I'll stay up. Maybe sleep in the other....with Derek tonight." This scenario wasn't what she craved, but it offered her a safe haven from the ubiquitous magnetic pull she felt around the writer. Lacy wanted nothing more than to retrace time and allow the telephone to ring and not be the carrier of this devastating news. She was not stupid, a little too trusting at times. No, Lacy knew exactly how this would affect her career. It seemed her greatest fear had become reality. It reminded her of her own words spoken not so long ago to Gage.
			<i>My greatest fear is that one day my private life will come into direct conflict with my professional life and I'll have to choose one or the other. </i>Now that choice loomed over her like a dark cloud. She prayed it would have a silver lining.
		</p>
		<p>"You want me to leave you alone, huh?" Feeling rejected, the writer's shoulders slumped.</p>
		<p>"I didn't mean it that way."</p>
		<p>Kneeling back down on the couch, Gage took Lacy's hand in hers. "Listen, Lacy, I want to help. Please don't push me away. No matter what becomes of us..." Motioning between them. "If nothing else happens, I still want us to be friends. I want to be there for you."</p>
		<p>Bringing the writer's hand up to her lips, she kissed it. "Thank you. I could sure use a friend about now."</p>
		<p>"Always." A bright smile peeked through the gloom that hung heavily in the room. "We could just sit here a while.... if you want to talk."</p>
