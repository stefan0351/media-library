<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 23 -->

<p>The next day Annika and B'Elanna awoke both stiff and sore.  Annika saw the marks on B'Elanna's skin and could not believe that she had been the one to inflict them.  She poured out water and bathed the bite mark and scratches gently.  B'Elanna's eyes were filled with love whenever she looked at her beautiful wife, and her decision to leave weighed heavy on her heart.  She did not relish the fact that she was going to have to tell the others of her decision this morning.  </p>
<p>They remained in their tent for most of the morning, talking and holding one another close.  Annika did not want to miss a moment of time with B'Elanna, and for the first time she didn't want to share her with the others.  But she knew that the rest of their family had a right to know what was going on and so they dressed slowly and made their way out to greet the rest of the group.</p>
<p>The others had torn down the camp, all except for the tent that Annika and B'Elanna had occupied, and now they were sitting around the fire waiting to see what was happening.  The looks on the faces of Annika and B'Elanna were enough to tell them whatever had happened was serious.  They all sat in silence for a moment until B'Elanna began to explain what had transpired between her and the King the previous day.  She explained that while she was in France her entire entourage was welcome to stay within the castle walls, protected by the King's men.  They would be fed, clothed and cared for over the winter in the castle while B'Elanna fought in France with the King's army.  When she was finished explaining what she hoped to gain by this endeavor she was greeted with silence.  It was Harry who finally spoke.</p>
<p>"I'm going with you."</p>
<p>His words were flat and inflectionless but they brooked no argument.  Sarah's sharp intake of breath was heard by all, but she didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"No Harry.  This is my task and I won't ask you to put your life at risk."</p>
<p>"I already owe you my life and so much more.  If you are going then I am going with you.  You need me to keep your identity safe at any rate."</p>
<p>B'Elanna knew that there was truth in his words, but she couldn't bear the thought of gentle Harry exposed to what she believed would be the horrors of war.</p>
<p>"I will travel with you and will fight with the archers.  Don't even think about arguing with me B'Elanna, there is nothing you can do or say to stop me from taking my place at your side."</p>
<p>"Thank you Harry," was all B'Elanna could manage.</p>
<p>They had one week to prepare before they left for France and in that time they had to move everyone inside the castle walls and make arrangements for horses to be stabled and cared for as well as the myriad other personal arrangements they needed to make in case one or both of them did not return from France.  A pall hung over the group as they realized that their time together was limited.  Tom and Kate both found employment in the castle, Tom in the stables and Kate in the kitchen.  Sarah was going to stay with Annika, as the bond that had been growing between them had been further strengthened now that Harry and B'Elanna were leaving for the war.</p>
<p>The rooms assigned to them were large and comfortable and B'Elanna took comfort in knowing that Annika would be safe, warm and protected while she was away.  She hated to leave and she was more frightened than she let on about what might lie ahead of her, but she believed deep in her soul that she was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Annika stayed close by B'Elanna's side for the entire week.  She couldn't bear to let the raven-haired beauty out of her sight, and she fretted when B'Elanna and Harry had to spend time with the King making preparations for their departure.  They made love several times each day, and neither one of them seemed to be able to satiate their need for one another even so.  </p>
<p>The group had managed to take two days to ride back to the enclave so that Harry and Sarah could be handfasted before Harry left for France and war.  They held a simple ceremony similar to the one that B'Elanna and Annika had used; despite their best efforts to make the wedding banquet a lively celebration, an air of solemnity hung over the evening.  B'Elanna made Harry promise that when they returned they would hold the ceremony again under happier circumstances.  Harry and Sarah remained in the village for their wedding night but B'Elanna and Annika rode all night to be back in London for B'Elanna's morning meeting with the King.  They rode together under a blanket of stars, and had the circumstances been different it would have been a most romantic setting.  Annika felt the need to be closer to B'Elanna and so she climbed up behind her on Goliath; they rode together, leading Jet by his reins.  She rode with her arms tight around B'Elanna's waist and her head resting on her shoulder.  As they rode they talked about what lay ahead and how difficult they were both going to find the separation.  Annika extracted a promise from the warrior that she would take no unnecessary risks and that she would return safely home to her.  B'Elanna gladly gave her word only hoping she would be able to keep it.</p>
<p>The week flew by and before they knew it the day had arrived when the King and his men, among them Harry and B'Elanna, were to march for Dover and the ships that would carry them to France. B'Elanna and Annika were up before dawn.  They made love gently and tenderly, mapping every curve and plane that the memory would carry them through the lonely days ahead. When they were done they stood unclothed on the balcony to watch the sun rise together.  </p>
<p>Annika bound B'Elanna's chest with hands that shook with emotion.  She carefully dressed her wife, tying every knot reverently, kissing the sun dark skin as it disappeared beneath the material of her clothing.  Finally she picked up B'Elanna's sword, holding it in her hands, praying to the gods that it would protect her wife in the trials ahead.  She unsheathed the blade, now sharpened for battle, and kissed it by way of a blessing before fastened it onto the broad leather belt that circled B'Elanna's waist.  They walked hand in hand down the stairs to the front of the castle where Tom was waiting with two horses each for both Harry and B'Elanna.  They had packed the rest of their equipment in with that of the regiment the day before and there was little else to do but say goodbye and join the one hundred and fifty other men who were going to France with the King.  </p>
<p>The order was given for the soldiers to mount up and B'Elanna leapt into her saddle with ease.  Annika stood beside her stirrup still unable to relinquish her hold on her wife.  B'Elanna leaned over and pulled her up with one arm and kissed her breathless.  </p>
<p>"I'll be home before you know it my love."</p>
<p>"I love you B'Elanna. I always will."</p>
<p>"I love you too," B'Elanna said simply before she lowered Annika back to the ground.</p>
<p>The cry went up to move out and Annika stepped back away from the line of soldiers, walking beside B'Elanna and Goliath until they rode through castle gates and were gone.  She sank to her knees and finally allowed her tears to fall freely.  She barely noticed when Sarah and Tom came to draw her up to her feet, and she allowed herself to be led blindly back to her rooms in the castle.  Her heart felt as if it were breaking when she saw the rooms now empty of B'Elanna and her belongings and so she begged Sarah to stay with her.  Sarah's own heart was hurting with the absence of her new husband and so she was only too happy stay with her friend.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The column of men moved through the early morning gloaming with only the sounds of creaking leather and the soft murmur of voices to be heard.  Harry rode beside B'Elanna but both of them were lost in their own thoughts and so they didn't speak.  The column was not going to be stopping for food, eating as they rode as they were hoping to reach Dover in two days of hard riding.  Despite B'Elanna's superior conditioning she was tired and sore when they finally stopped to sleep late in the night.  The men bedded down beside the fires they lit, only stopping to eat a hot meal before they rolled up in their blankets and fell asleep.  </p>
<p>A few hours later they were up and back on the road, not taking time for a hot meal before they once more set out for Dover.  They rode hard through the day and into the night, arriving in Dover shortly before midnight.  They loaded the horses and equipment onto the ships and then the men gathered down in the hold to try to sleep as the ships sailed out of the harbour with the morning tides.  Being trapped in the hold with smell of animals and unwashed bodies in her nostrils B'Elanna began to feel ill.  She was unable to sleep and eventually she and Harry took their blankets up on deck and curled up on the foredeck to sleep in the clean salt air.</p>
<p>They awoke hours later to the sounds of the deckhands hustling around to bring the ship safely into harbour. B'Elanna watched, fascinated, as the nimble young crewmen climbed swiftly to the top of the masts to adjust and lower sails as required.  Had her life taken a different turn she could imagine herself happy as one of these carefree youth.  They anchored in the harbour at Calais and took hours to unload the equipment onto the barges that were used to bring cargo ashore.  The horses and other livestock had to be lowered into the water and left to swim ashore as it was too dangerous to try to load them into the smaller boats.  B'Elanna held her breath the entire time that her animals were being offloaded and she was greatly relieved when Goliath staggered up onto the beach and shook the water furiously from his coat.  He seemed none the worse for wear and soon he was stabled with the others in preparation for their march the next day.</p>
<p>The field of battle to which they were headed was over two days hard ride away, and so the next day began before dawn.  The weather was cold and rainy and the soldiers made their way through mud and sludge very slowly, frequently having to stop and use poles and levers to get the supply wagons unstuck from the mud that often came higher than the axles as they traveled the tortuous route to the field of battle.  At night they slept on the cold hard ground; the King himself did not bother with a tent choosing to join his warriors and share in their hardships.  He took the time to make his way through the ranks of men at night; ensuring that they were as well as they could be under the circumstances. She had heard the stories of his misspent youth as Prince Hal and was impressed with the depth of change he had undergone.  She could see why his men loved him so well, and she determined to do her best to justify his belief in her when she was finally tested on the field of battle.</p>
<p>They finally caught up with the main battle force two days later and that night she and Harry shared a tent with about ten other soldiers just south of the battlefront.  She got no sleep at all that night and neither did Harry.  </p>
<p>It was still raining the next day.  The troops were up before dawn and Harry helped B'Elanna into her armour and went with her to prepare Goliath for the test ahead.  She swung easily into the saddle and looked down at Harry clad in his new studded leather armour.</p>
<p>"You take care of yourself today do you understand me," she ordered.</p>
<p>"You too B'Elanna, no being a hero.  I want you back in one piece tonight," Harry replied, swallowing hard to keep his emotions in check.</p>
<p>"I love you Harry," she said in a voice full of emotion, before wheeling Goliath around and joining the other mounted soldiers as they fell into battle formation.</p>
<p>The battalions lined up with the regiments of foot soldiers in front of the mounted rear guard.  The archers were further back, hidden in the tree line, and B'Elanna took comfort in the fact that Harry would be far from the main battle and protected by the trees.  Looking over the field of battle B'Elanna could see the French army lined up in a similar fashion.  She adjusted the unfamiliar shield that she needed to carry to protect herself on the battlefield and waited for the order to charge.  She could see toward the middle of the battle lines the banner of the King blowing in the wind despite its sodden condition.  The King himself would lead the mounted soldiers into battle.  </p>
<p>An eerie silence fell over the battlefield as they waited for the signal to commence hostilities.  B'Elanna could hear nothing but the creak of saddle leather, the rattling of chain mail, the occasional snort of a war horse, and then oddly the sweet song of a sparrow.  The tiny bird had not yet ceased its call when the air was filled with a sound like the hissing of a thousand snakes as a raft of arrows was released toward the French lines, the sky was further darkened by the deadly darts as they flew toward the enemy.  B'Elanna saw several men on the French lines fall, and she raised her shield in order to protect herself against the inevitable return fire. The air was darkened once again as the French released a flight of arrows.  The line of cavalry was too far back to be affected but she heard the cries of pain as several of the English foot soldiers were pierced with the deadly shafts.  At some unseen signal the French and English foot soldiers began to walk across the field toward one another.  They looked for all the world like men out for a leisurely stroll at first, but the closer the lines came to one another the faster they moved until the last few meters were covered at a full run.  She heard the clash of metal on metal and watched the beginning of the battle.</p>
<p>She and the other soldiers on the line strained forward, wanting to go to the aid of their fellow soldiers.</p>
<p>"HOLD!  HOLD!" was the call down the line, keeping them in check as another volley of arrows flew overhead.  The tension on the line reached the breaking point when the order finally came.</p>
<p>"CHARGE" was the call echoed down the line, accompanied by the blast of the trumpet that signaled the order to advance.</p>
<p>She dug her heels into Goliath and the line of horses and men surged forward as one, moving full tilt across the field.  She held her sword at the ready and took a tremendous swing at the first French soldier who came at her on the offensive.  The battle was well and truly joined.  </p>
<p>It was like nothing she had ever imagined; all around her were men wielding swords, pikes and spears.  She could only hack viciously at those who came within her wheelhouse.  She fought her way through the seething mass of soldiers and broke through the lines to engage with the French mounted troops.  The battle was hot and fierce and she lost count of the number of men she battled, some falling before her sword and some withdrawing before they could be harmed. Slowly the French were driving them back toward the English lines and once again B'Elanna found herself surrounded by men fighting both on foot and on horseback.  She felt rough hands grabbing at her legs and trying to haul her bodily from her mount.  She kicked away one man, striking another with her shield to force him to give way, but the sheer volume was too much to cope with and slowly, inexorably she felt herself dragged from her saddle.  She found herself on her back in the centre of a morass of legs.  She parried a blow that would have pierced her through the chest and managed to fight her way back to her feet.  Goliath was still nearby, waiting for his master to return, but she knew she would never be able to regain her seat on his back and so she struck him firmly on his flanks to signal that he should return to the lines.  She hoped she would see him again as he wheeled and ran.</p>
<p>She fought furiously, swinging wildly at anyone who wore the French insignia on their uniform.  She felt as if she had been fighting for days and her arms were growing tired with the exertion.  She saw a man approaching from her left and she turned to face him, blocking his first blow and then cutting his throat cleanly with her sword.  A gout of bright red blood burst from his severed arteries, covering her completely.  Her stomach heaved at the sight and in that moment of lost concentration she lowered her shield and was snapped back to reality at the sharp pain of an arrow piercing her shoulder.  She gasped at the sensation, but had no time to think about it as another wave of combatants was already filling the gap left by her fallen foe.  She could no longer hold her shield, as that was the shoulder that had been pierced by the arrow, so she dropped it on the ground and turned to face her attackers.  She saw the armour of the dark knight Gloucester nearby and fell back until she was close to him.  When he saw her he also moved in her direction.  They stood back to back and fought all who came against them until the tide of the battle began to ebb. The trumpets called the retreat and soon only a few minor skirmishes were still going on.  B'Elanna looked at the carnage around her, the smell of hot fresh blood assaulting her senses and she dropped to her knees, barely managing to remove her helmet before she emptied the contents of her stomach onto the ground.</p>
<p>She felt strong hands pulling her to her feet and turned to see the scarred visage of Gloucester.</p>
<p>"You need to get that arrow out of your shoulder as soon as possible Beyla," he said, looking concerned.</p>
<p>"Go ahead, do it," B'Elanna replied, knowing what had to be done.</p>
<p>Gloucester took the shaft in his hands and broke it with a quick snap.  A grimace of pain crossed B'Elanna's face, but she knew the worst was yet to come.  She removed her leather glove and wadded it up, placing it in her mouth so she would have something to bite down on as he worked.  At a nod from her, Gloucester began to push the shaft of the arrow through her shoulder.  The arrow had pierced her at the shoulder joint of her armour and he had used his dagger to cut away the leather at the point where the arrow would exit her flesh.  Tears ran down her face and her breath was laboured as he slowly moved the shaft through her body.  When the barb was sufficiently out on the other side he grasped it firmly and pulled it swiftly from her body.  She sank to her knees and spat the glove out of her mouth, gasping for breath as recovered from the searing pain.</p>
<p>"You bore that well Beyla, I've seen older, bigger men than you faint at the breaking of the shaft.  We'll make a real soldier of you yet," he said as he gathered up his scattered equipment.  "Here, you might want to keep this for a souvenir," he joked as he tossed her the broken shaft of the arrow.</p>
<p>"Thanks," was all she could manage as she began to walk with him back to the English lines.  All around them were the wounded and the dying.  They stopped to offer what assistance they could, but B'Elanna was losing blood and finally Gloucester insisted she return without further delay.  The white flag was flying and all around her was carnage.  The very ground itself was stained red with blood, and her stomach rolled at the sight of carrion birds perched on motionless bodies.  Men were helping one another to stand, and soldiers and others offered what medical aid they could to the men who were not able to leave the field.  She saw the stretcher-bearers as they made they way down to the wounded.  She felt as if she were walking through the depths of hell itself.</p>
<p>She felt a strong arm go around her waist to steady her on her feet, and she looked up into the concerned eyes of Harry.</p>
<p>"I can't leave you alone for a minute can I?" he chided.  "I was worried when Goliath came back to the camp without you."</p>
<p>"Is he all right?"  She asked, her first concern for her mount.</p>
<p>"Not a mark on him," Harry replied.  "Lets get you into the tent so I can see to your wound.</p>
<p>Harry led her into their tent, which was thankfully empty.  He removed her armour, grimacing at the dents and nicks the previously shining equipment now sported.  Removing her tunic he looked at the wound, which thankfully had passed through a relatively fleshy part of her shoulder.  He dug through his satchel and found several bags of the herbs he had brought with him from England.  He went out to the fire to fetch some boiling water in which to steep the medicines.  When he returned from the fire he carried a tin of water and a poker he had dragged from the fire; the tip glowed red from being kept in the heat of the coals.  Harry approached her slowly, setting down the water for the moment.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, this is really going to hurt.  I'm sorry, but I have to do this to stop the bleeding."</p>
<p>"Go ahead Harry, just get it over with," she said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>She felt the heat from the poker increase as it came closer to her skin.  When Harry finally made contact between the skin and the steel; B'Elanna felt a searing pain for an instant and then her world went black and she knew no more.</p>
<p>She awoke later to find Harry bandaging her wound.  He helped her back into her clothes and supported her weight over to a bedroll so that she could rest.</p>
<p>"Harry, I'm fine; you should see to the other wounded.  They need your help more than I do."</p>
<p>She desperately wanted Harry to become known as a healer among the soldiers and the leaders in particular as she knew he would then be perceived as valuable and would be protected in the upcoming battles.  An archer was expendable, but a skilled healer was irreplaceable and would not be put in an exposed position that would put his life at risk. </p>
<p>Harry left her slumbering in the tent and tended to the other fallen soldiers.  He worked tirelessly for hours and at the end of the evening many of the English wounded would owe their lives to him and the healing skills he had learned from Sarah.  He returned to the tent well after midnight and after checking B'Elanna's wound and ensuring that she was all right he lay down beside her and fell into a dreamless sleep.</p>
