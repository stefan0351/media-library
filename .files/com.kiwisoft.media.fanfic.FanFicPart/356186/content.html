<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 2: Lost and Found -->

<p>Sam was rummaging in her locker trying to find that notebook were she had notes for the school paper. She had all her ideas there; 'What's up with Nicole Julian's so called redemption?' and that stupid column about the deceased May Tuna. Sam had heard from Kennedy High's own gossip queen Mary Cherry that May's sister, April Tuna, had paid the principal to get that column in to the paper.</p>
<p>"I don't believe this! People on this school don't have the slightest clue about recycling garbage!" The girl standing next to Sam exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I though you have given up on that Lily"</p>
<p>"Sam, environmental issues are not something you give up just like that." Lily said in a serious tone shaking her head. Sam raised a brow. "Okay," the Latina continued, "I might not be as... pushy, as I used to be. But that does not mean that I have given up!"</p>
<p>"Okay Lily, I believe you." The brunette smiled. Knowing the assertively of Lily in these things, better not argue with her.</p>
<p>"Damn! I can't find my notebook."</p>
<p>"You mean that little red one you always carry around?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Have you seen it?"</p>
<p>"You left in on the desk last period. I saw it but I though you were going back to get it."</p>
<p>Sam slammed the door of her locker and walked rapidly towards the classroom with out saying anything. Lily figured Sam was going after her notebook and followed the brunette.</p>
<p>"It's not here!"</p>
<p>"Are you sure Sam? Have you checked under the seats?"</p>
<p>"Yes I have. God, I don't believe this! This is not good." Sam said holding her head with her hands.</p>
<p>"It's just a note book Sam."</p>
<p>"No Lily, It's not 'Just a notebook'!" Sam said on the edge of breakdown. "I have a lot of confidential info from my... sources. And if that information gets in the wrong hands. I'm fried! Dead!"</p>
<p>"You have sources?" Lily asked puzzled.</p>
<p>"Because of journalist ethics, I can't tell you her name, but it rimes with hairy berry. And you know that this hairy berry can say anything about anybody if you just press the right buttons."</p>
<p>"So what kind of information did you have in there?"</p>
<p>"I have been doing this thing about Nicole. Cause I think it's extraordinary, not to mention weird, how much she has changed since she hit me with the car. I think she went a little mental."</p>
<p>"You were gonna print that in the school paper?" Lily asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"No, it was just something I did for the challenge of it. And now my note book is probably SO in the wrong hands" Sam said throwing her hands in the air.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brooke was standing on the school parking lot, leaning against Sam's car taping her foot and starting to get a little bit too impatient.</p>
<p>"What's up hun?" She heard a voice say from behind.</p>
<p>"Hi Nic." Brooked offered a half-hearted smile.</p>
<p>"What are you...?" Nicole stopped mid sentence when she realized Brooke was standing next to Sam's car. "Do you want me to give you a ride home Brookie? Don't want you risking your life in the Spam mobile."</p>
<p>"Nic." Brooke pleaded.</p>
<p>"I know hun." The blonde sighed. "I am really trying my best to be all cordial with Miss McPherson you know."</p>
<p>"You don't have to pretend Nic. I think Sam will do just fine without your sympathy. She has the last three years." Brooke said dryly.</p>
<p>Nicole tried her best to hide the stabbing feeling of Brooke's words. Things between Brooke and Nicole had been not so very good for quite a while. Especially after the accident. And it was because of the accident that Nicole had changed her way of thinking, her way of acting. Heck, if she hadn't done that she'd be in juvenile by now. However, no one seemed to believe she had changed. No one was able to see the 'New Nicole'. The only thing her so-called friends could see was the old, cold-hearted, psycho bitch they had learned not to mess with.</p>
<p>"Okay Brooke. I'll see you tomorrow at practice." Nicole offered her a smile and turned to walk away.</p>
<p>Brooke stood stunned as the other blonde walked away. Nicole didn't give her a hard verbal punch right in the face, as she usually would do. Not even a snotty comment. Brooke couldn't even begin to understand what the heck had happened to Nicole. She could understand Nicole's regrets regarding the accident. Nevertheless, things were just too wired, even for Nicole.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Brooke was caught off guard as she felt a warm breath against her neck. "Hey princess."</p>
<p>"Jesus! Sam!" Brooke squirmed as she turned around feeling her heart race at 100 km/h. "Are you trying to scare me to death?"</p>
<p>"I was only saying hi. What's got you so scared?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing. I'm just tired. I've been waiting for you here almost twenty minutes!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Honey. Lily wanted to... ehm... talk to me, about something." Sam answered nervously. She didn't want Brooke to find out about the Nicole report. Brooke would make her stop writing it. And mabye even giving her a hard time about it.</p>
<p>"Something wrong Sammy?"</p>
<p>"Nah. Everything's okay." She wrapped her arms around the blonde's slim body and pulled her in for a kiss. "Let's go home instead. You promised we're gonna play to day." She whispered in a husky tone.</p>
