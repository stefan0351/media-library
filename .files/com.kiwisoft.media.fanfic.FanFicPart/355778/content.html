<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Ten -->

<p>The chilly air outside kept the group inside most of the morning so Gage Ballant took the time to replace the torn screen in the door. As usual, her shadow decided to help.</p>
		<p>Gage tore the old screen out and tossed it in the trash. Holding the new screen up against the door, she searched for the screen tool only to find Derek rolling it across the floor. "Derek, hand me that, okay?" </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Vrrroom." Powered by his hand, the tool rolled faster around an invisible racetrack.</p>
		<p>Watching the shy boy come out of his shell momentarily as he zoomed the screen tool faster and faster, Gage encouraged him. "That's it, Derek. You're out in the lead. You can make that turn, just once more around and you've..." </p>
		<p>Derek scooted along behind his pretend racecar, redirecting it; he headed straight for Gage shoving the screen tool racecar between her legs. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"...crossed the finish line. And we have a new winner, Derek Levine. Yeah!" Gage said excitedly.</p>
		<p>Derek threw up his hands in victory, giving the writer the opportunity she needed to grab the tool. "Yea, I win."</p>
		<p>"Yes you do." Gage pushed the tool along the screen's edges, tucking it securely in the door. When she was finished, Gage lifted the three-year-old high in the air, taking him on a victory lap.</p>
		<p>Dani watched silently as Gage played with Derek. She decided to read her magazine after being disappointed that their exploration of the cave had been delayed due to weather. </p>
		<p>"Lunch is ready." Lacy yelled.</p>
		<p>Tucking her young charge under her arm, Gage flew across the room. Excited, Derek hollered. "Fly plane. Fly like plane." With a safe landing on the kitchen chair, Gage settled next to Derek.</p>
		<p>Dani moseyed to the table, dropping her magazine on the table; she took a seat next to her mother. She watched Derek roll his make believe racecar along the table garnishing Gage's full attention. The young girl noticed both of them were completely oblivious to her presence.</p>
		<p>Lacy observed her usually boisterous daughter silently watch the playful interaction between her son and the writer.
			<i>I think my little ?always center of attention stage star' is jealous. </i>
		</p>
		<i>

		<p>
			After a relatively quiet meal, Gage suggested a trip outside since the afternoon sun burned down, warming the air. "What'd you say we go play outside? Check things out."
		</p>
		<p>"What about going to the cave?" The frown frozen in place throughout lunch hadn't thawed.</p>
		<p>"Dani, it's kinda late and I don't think we'd have enough time today." Gage offered. Earlier Lacy had explained her unwillingness for Dani to explore the cave. Lacy knew from her own experience how dangerous caves could be and the fact that Dani seemed obsessed with it chased her reluctance to explore the cavern into a full-blown fear. </p>
		<p>The young girl grabbed her magazine and retreated to the couch without a word.</p>
		<p>Gage threw a questioning look at Lacy. "She's just disappointed. She'll be okay." Lacy gathered the plates, depositing them in the sink.</p>
		<p>"Here, let me help." Jumping up, Gage collected the rest of the plates. Placing them in the sink, she turned back to help Derek down. He ran to the couch, raising his hands to his sister for help up on the couch. "I think he likes that tool better than the toy gun he got yesterday at the store."</p>
		<p>Lacy smiled. Listening to her daughter read to Derek, she turned back to Gage. "I don't really need help with these. There's not that much." Lacy dipped her hands in the hot dishwater, scrubbing one of the plates.</p>
		<p>Gage searched for and retrieved a dishtowel. Rising a glass, she toweled it dry. "I don't mind. Besides...." She stopped short.</p>
		<p>Curious, Lacy asked. "What?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing." Gage shifted her eyes away quickly.</p>
		<p>With soap bubbles on her hands, she cocked them on her hips. "Well, what is it?"</p>
		<p>Knowing she was in deep trouble, Gage let her thought spill out. "I never saw a big television star.... washing dishes." Pinned by an arched eyebrow, Gage rambled on. "On TV sure but not... you know. At least not in person." Scrambled for another plate, she quickly gave it a thorough drying, concentrating on every last bit of moisture attached to it.</p>
		<p>Returning to the soaking dishes, Lacy found another one to scrub. "Just because I have a very public job....." She sighed briefly at the lofty ideas most people had about actors. "I'm just a regular person."</p>
		<p>"Are you?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>Lacy, drying her hands on the apron surrounding her small waist, gazed intently into the writer's sincere green eyes. "Yes. With feelings like everyone else."</p>
		<p>A contemplative moment stilled in time as a mixture of emotions ricocheted between them. Both shared the same thought simultaneously,
			<i>I wonder what you're feeling. </i>
		</p>
		<p>The spell broke when Derek tugged at Gage's khaki shorts. "Jage, Dani don't read no more."</p>
		<p>"Why don't you take Derek outside? He doesn't like to be cooped up too long." Lacy suggested.</p>
		<p>Tossing the dishtowel down, she nodded in agreement. "Come on, little guy." Swooping him up in her arms, Gage looked at the young girl on the couch. "Dani?" Gage jerked her head toward the door.</p>
		<p>Dani ignored her completely.</p>
		<p>Gage shrugged toward Lacy then lobbed Derek up in the air. "Guess it's just you and me."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Bouncing down the porch steps, the writer let Derek down. They walked the short distance to the shore, taking in all the boating activities on the lake. Several boats pulled skiers around as the sun shone brightly down offering sparkling light glitters to cast off the water. Derek reached down and picked up a small shell. Offering it to Gage, he said. "Sssell."</p>
		<p>Gage kneeled down next to him, smiling. "Shell."</p>
		<p>"Sssell." He repeated.</p>
		<p>Squeezing the sides of his mouth together, she repeated. "Shh...ell."</p>
		<p>He spit out the word correctly. "Shhhell."</p>
		<p>"Excellent. Shell."</p>
		<p>"Shell." Derek smiled as he mimicked her.</p>
		<p>"Okay, how bout....Quint."</p>
		<p>Again, Gage helped Derek form his lips in order to produce the correct pronunciation. "Kkent." Derek said.</p>
		<p>"Closer then tent." Encouraging him further, puckering her own lips to pronounce the word. "Qu....int."</p>
		<p>Slowly, with Gage's help, Derek sounded the word out. "Koo...Koo...Qu...ent."</p>
		<p>"Okay, now faster. You can do it."</p>
		<p>"Qu...ent."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Yes." Gage jacked her arm in victory.</p>
		<p>Mimicking his hero, Derek agreed. "Yes." With a sharp wave of his arm, he laughed so hard he fell flat on his bottom into the wet muddy sand.</p>
		<p>Gage plopped down next to him, laughing. She landed flat on her back when Derek decided to pounce on her. "Hey." A glob of mud fell on her face when the young boy waved her arm above her.</p>
		<p>They could have salvaged their slightly muddy clothes and not faced the wrath of the mother that waited inside the cabin had it not been for the ski boat that decided just then to whip around the cove hurling a huge wave directly at them. Water splashed around them as they rolled in the mud, every inch of their clothes wet and muddy. The sudden conclave of chilled water spurred a mighty yelp from both mud-covered bodies.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Finishing the dishes, Lacy took a seat next to her silent daughter. "What's up?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing." Dani absently flipped through her magazine.</p>
		<p>"Nothing, huh? You sure are saying a lot of nothing for nothing to be wrong. You and I both know that's not you're usual modus operandi."</p>
		<p>"You mean it's not my style." Dani offered her mother a mock glare at her mother's use of the big word, thinking she wouldn't know the meaning. "I am almost nine, you know."</p>
		<p>"Quite right. So, are you going to tell me why you were rude to Gage?"</p>
		<p>Lacy curled her arm around her daughter. "She's been nothing but nice to all of us. She let you drive her boat and do I have to remind you about the story she told you last night."</p>
		<p>"To be continued." Dani offered as a way of deflecting that particular nicety. "She hasn't taken me to the cave."</p>
		<p>"What is it with you and that cave? Honey, I know you love exploring, but even for you this is a bit much. It's like you've become obsessed with it."</p>
		<p>Dani deliberated her mother's words. She finally voiced her inner thoughts. "There's something about that cave that.... it's like it holds a secret or something. I don't know. I get this weird feeling about it. And, what if Gage is trying to keep me from finding out....whatever it is." Her eyes scrunched at that mysterious implication.</p>
		<p>Always respectful of her daughter's peculiar insight, Lacy decided this time Dani's feelings might stem from something else. "Are you sure you're not jealous of the bond Gage has with Derek?"</p>
		<p>Before she could retort her mother's question, a shriek raged through the house. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Dani and Lacy ran over the small ridge toward the water's edge. Slightly out of breath, they came to rest just short of where the grass met the muddy shore only to find two familiar figures. Covered in mud from head to toe, two sets of eyes popped up staring at them. The ?we're in trouble now' expression that adorned both Gage and Derek's dirty faces started a wave of amusement that crested into a hearty laugh from Dani and her mother.</p>
		<p>Derek's only reaction was to hold up a tiny object in his hand and proudly said. "Shell."</p>
		<p>Lacy delicately lifted her son in her arms. "Come on, honey. Let me help you." Scanning her son all over, she shook her head. "You definitely need a bath." The dark haired women threw Gage a disapproving look that warmed into a smile. "You both do."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Yeah, but he gets you to help him with his bath. Wish you were going to help me.</i>
		</p>
		<p>As if she read her mind, Gage's face brightened when Lacy suggested. "You'll need some help, too." Lacy gawked at Gage, but said to her daughter. "Dani."</p>
		<p>Gage's  wicked grin took a nosedive as Dani perked up. "I'll get the hose."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>A few hours later, well fed and dry, Gage carried Derek to bed followed by Lacy and Dani. After Lacy informed her that Dani had been jealous of the bond she shared with Derek, Gage altered the original version of the Shanglon Master story to include a cave. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"The evil Robida had kidnapped the beloved maiden, Mecca, and hid her in one of the nearby ancient caves." Gage took a moment to glance at the young girl who retained her neutral expression, but was obviously following the story closely. "The whole land was up in rage especially our hero, Geoff, the Shanglon Master. Along with his free thinking computer, Quint."</p>
		<p>"Quint." Derek echoed.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Yes, Quint. Geoff and a few of his fighting elite scoured the land. Two days had come and gone and no sign of Mecca. With Geoff fraught with anger and deep despair, Quint suggested he use his astral mental powers to connect with his love."</p>
		<p>"Can they go through the cave walls?" Dani astutely asked.</p>
		<p>"What are astral mental powers?" Lacy challenged.</p>
		<p>Gage tossed Lacy a ?why don't you just go along with the story like your daughter' look then addressed Dani. "Yes, they can due to the soul connection they have for each other. Only true soul mates are able to transmit these powerful rays through anything." Gage spared a quick glimpse to Lacy, seeing a flicker of recognition in her blue eyes. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"I thought as much." Dani pondered the notion while Lacy spared a doubtful look to Gage.</p>
		<p>The storyteller noticed Derek trying to chase away his closing eyelids without much success and decided to conclude part two. "Anyway, Geoff connected with his love and felt an overwhelming damp, cold sensation surrounded by darkness. With this knowledge, Quint sent a scan out blanketing the countryside with his extra sensory terrain transmission. When Quint mentioned the ancient caves, Geoff dashed out the door before his computer could stop him. Suddenly reappearing, Geoff ordered Quint to transport him to the cave's entrance." Gage paused, wanting to end the story for night. </p>
		<p>"I hope this isn't the kind of story where Mecca has to have a man to save her. Is it?" All the while, Dani had decided in her mind that she was Mecca and knew, without a doubt that if she were stuck in a cave, she'd surely find a way out without any help. Years of watching her mother's cop show, Dani learned to differentiate between a helpless female and a strong one. Dani fancied herself after Samantha Gordon, the character her mother played was strong willed and independent.</p>
		<p>"Well, no, not really." Gage quickly countered. "But she does have some help from Geoff. That's okay, right?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, why not?" Dani capitulated. "You did make him the hero of the story." Dani twisted around, pulling the covers up tightly. As sleep claimed her, Dani allowed her creative mind to soar deep inside the cave searching for ways Mecca could escape.</p>
		<p>"She's a hard sell." Gage sighed, not feeling she'd made any progress in her attempt to reconnect with the young girl.</p>
		<p>Instinctively, Lacy moved closer. "She's fine. And she really likes the story, you know. Adding the cave was brilliant."</p>
		<p>"I'm not so sure. She had too much fun hosing me off earlier." Gage pinned Lacy with an adamant look. "I mean it, she was brutal. Having way too much fun at my expense. As a matter of fact, you did, too."</p>
		<p>"You have to admit it was funny." The grin on her face would not let up. "You finally got all the mud out, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm. With no help from you."</p>
		<p>"All you had to do was ask." Lacy said innocently.</p>
		<p>Green eyes nearly skyrocketed out of her head.
			<i>Ask! I would have begged. </i> Gage glanced at Lacy as she rested her head softly on the pillow close by. An innocent look remained on her beautiful features causing Gage to shake her head in self-reproach.
			<i>What I'm I doing? She hasn't done one thing or gave one iota of a sign that she would ever be interested in me. Get a grip, Ballant. And I don't even want to think about the fact that she's married.</i>
