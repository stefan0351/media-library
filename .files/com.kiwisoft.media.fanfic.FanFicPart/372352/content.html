TWO</b></p>
<p>"Jackson and I are heading out for the game, we should be back in the morning," Called out Robbie Ray Stewart to his daughter, who was in the kitchen making bags of popcorn. "You have fun tonight, and call Roxy if you need anything."</p>
<p>Miley turned to him and waved. <i>Like hell I'm going to call Roxy</i>. "I'll do that, daddy. Bye."</p>
<p>The front door slammed shut, and Miley relaxed, knowing that she was now completely alone. The microwave went off, so she opened it up and grabbed the bag of popcorn from inside. Next to the microwave sat two bowls, one of them already full of popcorn. Seeing this, she dumped the bag into the empty bowl. Smiling to herself, satisfied when she saw that she avoided burning the kernels, Miley picked up the bowls and sat them down on the coffee table in front of her family's large green couch. Then, happy with the set up, she lay down on the couch, content with waiting for her friends to arrive.</p>
<p>A knock on the door startled her, but before she could move to answer it, Lilly was already inside the door, taking off her light jacket and throwing it across the back of the couch.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lils." Miley greeted shyly as she moved toward the kitchen. "Why don't you put a movie in? I'll get us some drinks."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and smiled. "I'll do that."</p>
<p>Miley smiled back and walked into the kitchen, moving to an overhead cupboard to get two glasses. Her fingers barely touched one of the glasses when she felt two hands on her waist and hot breath against the back of her neck. Miley wrapped her fingers around the glass and set it down on the counter, and she closed her eyes. Lilly pressed the entire front of her body against Miley's back, her lips settled against Miley's clothed shoulder.</p>
<p>Miley groaned as one of Lilly's hands dipped just below the waistline of her shorts. Her fingers left the glass, now gripping the edge of the counter. Lilly's left hand slid underneath her shirt, her hand like white-hot fire as it passed over her stomach and covered her breast. Miley hung her head as Lilly squeezed her breast, her nipple caught between Lilly's thumb and index finger as she rolled it into a hard peak, her other hand sliding farther down between her legs.</p>
<p>"Do you know how good you feel?" Lilly asked, withdrawing her hands and turning Miley around. Her right hand fell back into its previous position as Miley once again grabbed the edge of the counter. "How… <i>hot</i> and… <i>wet</i> you are – just for <i>me</i>?"</p>
<p>Lilly slowly moved inside of Miley, moving in and out then side to side, drawing only whimpers and moans from the brunette as she threw her head back. Her hips rolled as she moved against Lilly's fingers. "Just to let you know… it feels amazing. I <i>love</i> being inside of you."</p>
<p>Miley's head fell forward onto Lilly's shoulder, where she instantly bit into the girl's clothed shoulder as she felt herself climb higher to where she desperately needed to be.</p>
<p>"You can't do this to me, Lilly," Miley turned her head to the side, panting against Lilly's ear.</p>
<p>"I'm not doing anything to you," Lilly replied, smiling as she used her left hand to lift Miley's head, easily engaging her in an open-mouth kiss. Their tongues slid against each other's before Lilly pulled away, her left hand once again finding Miley's breast. "You're asking for this, Miles. You want me."</p>
<p>"No, I don't." Miley barked back, her hips rolling against Lilly's fingers. "I don't want you."</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged with one shoulder. "Fine." In an instant, Lilly had withdrawn both hands from Miley's body, leaving her with a startling emptiness between her legs and an ache in her chest. God damn, she had been so fucking close…</p>
<p>Miley turned around after a moment, the ache in her chest easing into nothingness when she saw Lilly propped against the counter, her tongue darting out to clean her fingers. Miley watched, her lips parted – such a turn on, she thinks to herself.</p>
<p>"You sure you don't want me?" Lilly asked with a wink.</p>
<p>"I think I'm a liar when I say I don't want you." Miley said quietly, leaning back against the counter when Lilly is suddenly <i>right there</i>.</p>
<p>"You <i>think</i>?" Miley blushed at Lilly's words, but then her lips are against Lilly's and her blush is gone and those fingers are working her again and –</p>
<p>The doorbell. Miley sat up and blinked the sleepiness from her eyes, the burning between her legs at an all time high. Looking at the front door from her spot on the couch, she could see Lilly, Oliver, and Joannie on the other side. Then Lilly was reaching for the doorknob to let them in because Oliver was too busy making out with Joannie, and Miley hopped over the back of the couch and darted upstairs just as they walked inside.</p>
<p>"Miley?" Lilly called out, seeing her friend's retreating form. "Miley!"</p>
<p>Miley ignored her, seeking refuge in her bedroom and locking the door behind her. She fell onto her bed and tore her shorts and underwear down her legs to her ankles, slipping her hand between her legs even as a heavy fist pounded against her door. Miley twisted over onto her stomach, getting on her knees and spreading her legs for easy access before burying her face in her pillow as she gasped at the sensations she was giving herself – that <i>Lilly</i> was giving her.</p>
<p>Biting into her pillow as she came, Miley let out a whimper and collapsed, completely spent.</p>
<p>"Miles, are you okay?" Lilly's voice filtered through the door, and just the sound of her voice made Miley throb again and again.</p>
<p>Miley couldn't even lift her head from the pillow, just turning her head to the side to answer. "I-I'm fine. I just need to change real quick. I'll be down in a few minutes. How about you put a movie in while you wait?"</p>
<p>Miley could practically hear the wheels turning in her best friend's head, but chose to ignore the feelings of guilt that rose in her throat like bile. Instead she focused on her physical appearance. Her lungs were on fire and her eyes were half-lidded, her entire body covered in sweat. Not to mention, her hand was still buried between her legs, stroking herself as she calmed down. The sound of Lilly's voice drew her from her acute awareness of just how silly she must look.</p>
<p>"I'll do that." Lilly responded, her voice softer.</p>
<p>The sound of retreating footsteps let Miley breathe easier. She pulled her fingers from herself, wiping them against her shirt. Her heart was still racing, hammering against her ribcage. Her thoughts were jumbled, but luckily she had enough sense to get up from her bed and change her clothes. There was no reason to go downstairs smelling like… well, sex.</p>
<p><i>But it wasn't just sex,</i> Miley thinks to herself, <i>it was Lilly-sex.</i> And although that made it absolutely wonderful in her mind, her scent alone would raise a lot of questions.</p>
<p>And oh, God, Miley would sure as hell by a liar if she said she didn't want Lilly, and it was about time she admitted it to herself.</p>
