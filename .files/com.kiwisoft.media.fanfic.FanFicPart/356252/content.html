<!-- I Can Crack All Your Ribs But I Can't Break Your Heart \ Part 3 -->

<i>
<p>Dear Brooke,</p>
<p>Thinking of you used to be something I tried to avoid. If I allowed
myself thoughts of you at all, they were quickly locked away in a
small, hard place, as dense and impenetrable as an avocado stone. Now
it's as if I've suspended them in a glass and given them free reign to
develop and mature. Soft, tender shoots have broken through and grown
into tensile tendrils, finding fertile ground in which to take root.</p>
<p>Okay, that avocado metaphor may be a little overdone, but it doesn't
change the fact that my desire for you is now firmly entrenched. My
thoughts... I can't unthink them; I can't unlearn what I know about you,
so I am writing it down, getting it all out. And hopefully you won't
mind if I offer them to you in this letter.</p>
<p>I want so much to be able to touch you. To feel with my fingers the
soft skin on your arm when the little hairs there glint in the
sunlight would, I think, make me giddy. I would like to know what that
place in the middle of your upper lip feels like; I'm thinking smooth
and warm like the nap of finest velvet. I'm sure there is a name for
that place, but not knowing what it's called doesn't make me want to
cover it with my own lips any less. I want to intimately know your
entire body - from the peach fuzz curves of your ears to the
hardworking roughness of the soles of your feet.</p>
<p>If you were to think of me, let it be as one mesmerized by a very
pleasant daydream. Maybe looking out a window somewhere, hand under
my chin and supporting my head as it grows heavy over my preoccupation
with you. And if time were money, I'd consider all the hours spent
thinking of you a very wise investment.</p>
<p>Josh</p>

<p>"Whatcha got there, Brookie?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, Nic." Brooke quickly folded the letter and placed it on top
of her textbook.</p>
<p>"Doesn't look like nothing. You were reading that thing so intensely
it looked like it might be pictures of next season's Galliano
collection. What gives?" Nic sat down at their usual table and gazed
at her expectantly. It was lunchtime, although neither girl had eaten
anything yet.</p>
<p>Brooke slid her eyes over at Nic. She hadn't been able to stop
reading this second letter since she had found it poking out of her
bag after third period. Not knowing what to do and needing to talk
about it with someone, Brooke decided to open up to the girl now
checking for shine with her compact mirror. "It's a letter. From Josh."</p>
<p>"Josh?" Nic closed her compact and frowned over her ignorance to this
development.</p>
<p>"It's a love letter." Brooke handed it over.</p>
<p>Nic quickly read it, then glanced at Brooke before reading it again.
After an extended pause, she cleared her throat and said, "That's
sweet. I didn't know Josh was the hearts and flowers type." Handing
the letter back to Brooke, she added, "Congratulations, hon. I always
knew Kennedy's premier power couple would be restored to their
rightful place at the pinnacle of the social pyramid. Although I am
surprised that you didn't tell me when it happened."</p>
<p>"But we're not together again. He just started sending these letters
out of the blue."</p>
<p>"Letters?" Nic asked. "Plural?"</p>
<p>"This is the second one."</p>
<p>"So what did you say to him?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. We haven't talked about it," Brooke's face reflected her
confusion. "What should I do?"</p>
<p>"That depends. Do you want to go out with him again?"</p>
<p>"Before I got these letters, I would have said no, definitely not.
But now," Brooke looked at the page wistfully, "I don't know. I
really love what he's saying here, but how much of that will carry
over into reality? I have so many doubts. And I broke up with him.
And what about the disaster that was taking our relationship to the
next level? Just when I think it's time to move on, he writes these
amazing things that make me want to try again."</p>
<p>"Well, I think that answers the question. Doesn't it say something
that he's trying so hard to win you over?" Nic said reasonably. "It's
creative, it's thoughtful, and sort of sexy in a 'How do I love thee,
let me count the ways' kind of way."</p>
<p>"You mean, like poetry?" Brooke said dreamily, then shook herself out
of her sappy musings. It's not poetry," she clarified, "but it makes
me feel like I'm reading a poem. Like ordinary words have new
meanings. He just seems so sincere."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, he's not Shakespeare, but it's not bad. I should have
known a guy who does musicals would have a bit of poetry in his soul."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Booke replied distractedly. She was clearly not paying attention.</p>
<p>"So what are you going to do?" Nic asked after a moment.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go talk to him." Finally reaching a decision, Brooke
got up and walked out of the cafeteria, knowing exactly where to find
Josh.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Did you give it to her?" Sam couldn't stop herself from asking,
lunch was almost over and Josh had been studious and quiet and
distinctly unforthcoming today. She was feeling a bit unappreciated
after providing him with another letter, an unsolicited one at that.</p>
<p>"Yes. I stuck it in her bag when she was walking to third period.
She didn't even notice me," Josh replied. He was experiencing vague
feelings of guilt regarding the second letter. The first was fine, a
spur of the moment idea that hadn't paid off, as he had received no
response from Brooke. When Sam gave him a second letter this morning,
he found he was willing to try again, but was a little bewildered by
Sam's voluntary submission. It felt wrong to continue to take credit
for Sam's letters, and why was Sam writing them anyway? It was all
slightly strange.</p>
<p>"She must have read it by now," Sam muttered, almost to herself.</p>
<p>"Hey guys, mind if I sit?" Harrison dropped into a chair at their
table without waiting for a reply. I have a David Copperfield vocab
quiz period after next. Do either of you know what pecuniary means?"
he asked, pulling from his backpack a notebook and a well-thumbed copy
of the book in question.</p>
<p>"Nope," Josh returned to his history book.</p>
<p>"It means having to do with money." Sam said briefly before turning
back to Josh. "What did she say about the first one?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. We haven't talked."</p>
<p>"Who? What are you guys talking about?" Harrison asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing." Josh and Sam spoke in unison.</p>
<p>"Okaaay," Harrison backed off, this was obviously a touchy subject.</p>
<p>There was silence at the table as the three worked independently until,</p>
<p>"Josh, can I talk to you for a minute?"</p>
<p>Three heads looked up at Brooke, who had eyes only for Josh, standing
by their table.</p>
<p>"Sure, Brooke," Josh smiled and leaned toward her.</p>
<p>Brooke glanced at Sam and Harrison. "In private?"</p>
<p>Harrison watched Sam watch intently as the pair walked to the far side
of the room and disappeared into the stacks.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Harrison asked Sam.</p>
<p>With a concentrated effort, Sam tore her gaze from the bookshelves
that now hid the couple. Her voice was hard and hollow. "Brooke and
Josh are getting back together as we speak."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"I got your letters."</p>
<p>Josh nodded and gave Brooke a tight smile. They were standing beside
a window at the end of a narrow passageway created by two
floor-to-ceiling book cases. Dust motes swirled in the shaft of
light that fell on them.</p>
<p>"They were beautiful. I loved what you said in them. I didn't know
you still felt that way, Josh."</p>
<p>"Listen, can we not talk about the letters? They don't mean anything-"</p>
<p>"Of course they do. For the first time I'm getting some insight on
how you really feel." Brooke searched Josh's down-turned features for
some kind of evidence. "Is it... how you feel?"</p>
<p>"You know it is, Brooke," Josh replied. "I told you that the day you
broke up with me."</p>
<p>His hurt tone ruffled Brooke's feathers. "But since then you've
rejected an attempt I made to get back together and you've gone out
with another girl. What am I supposed to think of that?"</p>
<p>Josh had no answer. He sat down on the window's wide wooden sill. "I
don't know. I was really hurt; I didn't know what I wanted. I guess
I just needed time to figure that out, and now I know it's you."</p>
<p>He sounded so certain, and Brooke was so far from certainty herself.
"I don't know, Josh. I just don't know if this is the right thing.
For either of us." She gazed keenly at him, trying to divine what was
really in his heart.</p>
<p>Knowing he had some heavy-duty convincing to do, Josh became desperate
and said the first thing that came to mind. "Look. I think we need
to draw a line between what happened before and what is happening now.
Make a line of marcation, or something."</p>
<p>Brooke's eyes softened. If they were going to try, this seemed very
sensible. And it told her that he was serious about this. "That's a
good idea, Josh. The past is past."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Josh sounded relieved.</p>
<p>"But if we're going to try again, I want to go slow. Baby steps. I'm
talking glacial pace, here. We rushed into some important decisions
last time and I don't want that to happen this time. We both need to
be sure every step of the way." Brooke sat down next to him on the
window sill, their hands touched.</p>
<p>Elation surged through Josh when he felt Brooke's hand cover his.
This was going to work! He put his arm around Brooke and pulled her
into his chest.</p>
<p>Brooke leaned her head against his shoulder, admitting to herself how
good the weight of Josh's strong arm felt. Suddenly she felt his lips
on her cheek, and then he took her completely by surprise, grasping
her upper arms, turning her towards him and kissing her forcefully,
his tongue pushing into her mouth.</p>
<p>Although he had never before given her reason to fear him, Brooke
panicked at Josh's effortless physical dominance. She brought her
palms up, pushing as hard as she could against his chest. "Didn't you
hear what I just said? I said SLOW!"</p>
<p>Josh stared at her, speechless.</p>
<p>Brooke gazed back, trying to get a handle on her confusion and
instinctual distrust. She tried to reconcile the earnest voice in his
letters with the actual boy in front of her - and couldn't. "This was
a mistake," she muttered, backing away from him.</p>
<p>"No, wait! Brooke, I'm sorry," Josh called after her, but she was
already gone from sight.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam and Harrison looked up to see Brooke rushing by their table on her
way out of the library. A few seconds later, Josh emerged from the
stacks, looking grim.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Sam demanded.</p>
<p>"I kissed her."</p>
<p>"But that's good, right?" Harrison wanted to know.</p>
<p>"Then why did she just run out of here like you're Wile E. Coyote and
she's the Road Runner?" Sam didn't wait for Josh to answer Harrison.
Something was not right. She could feel it.</p>
<p>"We were talking, it was going well," Josh reported. "We decided to
try again, and she said she wanted to go really slow. I put my arm
around her. Then, I just had to kiss her; it was like this
unstoppable urge. So I did. And it was too much. Too fast. She
changed her mind. Just like that." He snapped his fingers, it
sounded like a whipcrack in the quiet library.</p>
<p>"Just because you kissed her? That makes no sense. It's not like you
haven't kissed her before, I've seen it with my own eyes." Sam said,
trace amounts of bitterness detectable in her voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, she wasn't ready for it. I pushed too hard," Josh spoke
savagely, looking right at Sam. "It's my fault. And why do you care
so much, anyway?"</p>
<p>"So you're just giving up?" Harrison asked, totally invested in this
soap opera now.</p>
<p>"No, he's not giving up," Sam answered for him. She turned to Josh,
"Are you?"</p>
<p>"No, but-"</p>
<p>"The bell is going to ring any second. What class does she have now?"
Sam asked Josh, in total planning mode.</p>
<p>"Drafting," Harrison replied, shrugging when Sam and Josh turned to
him in surprise.</p>
<p>"Brooke takes drafting?" Josh wondered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's part of that interior design kick she's been on," Sam
said, only knowing this fact because of her talent for eavesdropping
on her mother's conversations with Brooke. "Go meet her at her class
and try and talk to her. Apologize, grovel, do what it takes."</p>
<p>Just then the bell rang that signaled changing classes. None of them
made a move to leave; they were all too caught up in Josh and Brooke's
drama.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed the bell, Josh said, "She won't listen to
me, Sam; she's pissed."</p>
<p>"That's why you have to do it now, before the anger sinks in. It's
like a grass stain. If you don't shout it out now, it'll be even
harder to remove later." Sam thought for a minute, then turned to
Harrison. "They use computers in drafting, don't they?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I took it last semester. We did some stuff on AutoCAD."</p>
<p>"Josh, you could email her. Or better yet, IM her." Sam suggested.</p>
<p>"Right now? She won't have her email open, or instant messenger,"
Josh protested. "And anyway, I hardly ever use email. I don't think
I've emailed Brooke more than a few times. I always just call her."</p>
<p>"Well, she can't take your calls in class and desperate times call for
desperate measures."</p>
<p>"Wait. Emory's in that class. I'll text him to tell Brooke to open
an IM client right now." Harrison pulled out his phone and quickly
sent a text message.</p>
<p>"Do those computers even have instant messenger on them?" Josh was
still unsure.</p>
<p>Harrison smirked. "Look around. There's three class labs plus the
machines in here, and one tech for the whole school. It takes three
seconds to reinstall after he removes it. The dude really needs to
use better security." He moved to one of the library workstations and
sat down. "Josh, what's your user ID?"</p>
<p>Josh and Sam went and stood behind him. "jfordqb2000," Josh replied.</p>
<p>"Password?"</p>
<p>Josh hesitated a moment before saying, "Mickey mouse, no space."</p>
<p>After a few keystrokes Harrison said, "Look. Ready and waiting. A
little yellow smiley face next to 'blu_brookemcq.' Who do you think
that might be?" He stood up and pulled the chair back for Josh, who
then sat down.</p>
<p>"She's there?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yep. All you have to do is type," Harrison replied.</p>
<p>Sam and Harrison stood behind Josh, the thought of giving him some
privacy never entering their minds. Sam especially appeared to be a
bit on edge; her arms were crossed over her chest and she gnawed on a
thumbnail while waiting for Josh to put the keyboard to use.</p>
<p>Finally, after thirty seconds that passed in super slo-mo, he began to
peck with his two index fingers.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: Hi Brooke, r u there?</p>
<p>A few moments passed, then, in the IM window appeared:</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Josh, I don't have time for this. I'm in class.</p>
<p>Josh stared at the screen. "See? She's mad. I don't even know what
to say to her."</p>
<p>"Tell her you're sorry," Sam urged.</p>
<p>Dutifully, Josh typed:</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: I know, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Sam couldn't help interjecting, "No! That sounds like you're sorry
for interrupting her in class. You need to apologize for what
happened here and tell her why you're sorry."</p>
<p>Harrison and Sam watched as Josh typed with painful slowness.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: And I'm sorry for what happened in the library. It's
just that you're so hot and you looked so awesome and you smelled so
good. I couldn't help it.</p>
<p>Harrison rolled his eyes and Sam just barely stifled a groan.</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Are you saying it's my fault?</p>
<p>All three of them could hear the iciness in Brooke's reply.</p>
<p>Josh held up his hands in a gesture of surrender. "I can't do this.
I have no idea what to say."</p>
<p>"Get up," Sam said. When Josh didn't move, she put her hand on his
shoulder and repeated, "Get up. I can fix this."</p>
<p>"Wait Sam, what are you doing?" Harrison looked at her askance.</p>
<p>Josh got up and Sam slid into his seat and quickly began to type.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: Is it your fault that I lose hold of my senses when I'm
in your presence? Is it your fault that I feel drawn to you with the
inevitability of a moth to a naked 100 watt bulb? That my hands
disobey my brain and reach for you when I know it could mean my
downfall? Maybe you won't like this answer, but yes, it is your fault.</p>
<p>Sam slapped the enter key and Josh clapped his hands on his head.</p>
<p>"Oh god, she'll hate me!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Let's see what she makes of that," Sam said, not sounding as sure of
herself as she was ten seconds ago.</p>
<p>Harrison simply looked from Josh to Sam in silence, trying to decipher
why Sam was calling the shots and why Josh was allowing it.</p>
<p>A message at the bottom of the window told them Brooke was typing a
reply. They didn't have to wait long to see:</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Go on.</p>
<p>For Sam, those two words were like the drawbridge opening up, her
permission to enter the castle. She hunched over the keyboard and
went on.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: What I feel for you is strong. So strong that sometimes
my actions are pure instinct. And my instincts don't always follow
the path of politeness and manners. At the basest level, my response
to you is violent, immediate, and fierce. But it is also the truest
expression of what is in my heart. My feelings towards you are not
ambivalent and I find it impossible to subjugate them - even for your
sake. Please accept my deepest apology. I can't promise it won't
happen again; you are as powerful and potent as any drug and I am a
hopeless addict. But I want nothing more than to honor your wishes
and I'll try with all my heart to be what you want me to be.</p>
<p>Sam sat back while Josh and Harrison leaned in closer, waiting for
Brooke's response.</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Meet me at the water fountain by the Novak. Now.</p>
<p>Sam, unthinkingly, was halfway out of her chair when Josh shook her
shoulders in triumph, effectively pushing her back down.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Sam! That was so awesome! I totally owe you." He scampered
back to the table and collected his belongings before exiting the
library.</p>
<p>"Don't screw it up this time," Sam muttered.</p>
<p>Harrison pulled a chair over to Sam's workstation and sat down beside
his longtime friend, who now sat staring sightlessly at the computer
screen before her.</p>
<p>"Would you mind telling me what you think you're doing?" he asked.
"That's pretty mean, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Mean?" Sam turned to look at him, bewildered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, mean. You're manipulating things between Josh and Brooke, and
the reason can't be good. Is this another stunt in your war against
the popular crowd, the results of which I can't begin to fathom?"
Harrison was Sam's staunch friend, but even he was losing patience
with her unreasonable aversion to certain members of their class.
Admittedly, she hadn't done anything lately, but that didn't mean she
wasn't taking the longer view.</p>
<p>"I'm not being mean. Josh asked me for help and I'm helping him."</p>
<p>"He asked you to help him get back together with Brooke? I find that
a little hard to believe, since you extremely hate her."</p>
<p>"I do not hate her," Sam said defensively. "So I wrote a couple of
love letters for him, what's the big deal?"</p>
<p>"You wrote love letters? For him to give to Brooke?" Josh asked
incredulously.</p>
<p>"I think she really liked them," Sam said faintly.</p>
<p>Harrison just stared. He didn't even know where to begin. Did Sam
all of a sudden have a personality transplant, or was she simply
abducted by aliens and replaced by someone who looked and talked like
Sam, but was actually a pod person from a Sci Fi channel series.
"Don't you think that's a little personal to do for someone else?"</p>
<p>Sam gazed right into Harrison's eyes, revealing something huge for the
first time. "Not if I feel the same way."</p>
<p>This cleared up nothing. Harrison was completely confused. "You mean
you were writing the letters to Josh?"</p>
<p>Now impatient for him to catch up, Sam said, "No. I was writing the
letters to Brooke. Every word is true. I was being completely honest."</p>
<p>"So you wrote love letters to Brooke? But she's a girl. And you hate
her."</p>
<p>"No, I don't hate her. The opposite, in fact." She was calm; it felt
kind of good to finally get it out. "And yes, she's a girl," Sam
confirmed the obvious for Harrison.</p>
<p>"So you like her? Like, like her?" Wait. That would mean... "You
mean, the way my mom likes girls?" Harrison was having trouble
wrapping his mind around this.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"I know it's a lot to take in. I hardly knew how to process it myself."</p>
<p>Sam liked girls. Harrison's shoulders slumped as the realization sunk
in. What was it about Sam? And Brooke, too, for that matter.
Somewhere in a secret place inside him he had always thought that a
woman who combined the best attributes of both Sam and Brooke would be
the girl to whom he would completely lose his heart. Brooke had never
been an attainable goal, and now Sam was off limits too. He decided
to think about that later and get back to the situation at hand. Poor
Sam. And poor Brooke. "Sam, you have to tell her," Harrison grabbed
Sam's arm and spoke in an urgent tone.</p>
<p>Sam laughed like it was funny. "I can't tell her, I could barely tell
you, and I'm not ready to come out."</p>
<p>"No. You have to tell her that you wrote the letters, not Josh."</p>
<p>"No I don't. She'll never know it was me. I can work out a little
angst and Josh gets the credit. Neither Josh nor I have a problem
with that."</p>
<p>"But Brooke might have a problem with it."</p>
<p>Sam was silent. She had never thought of that. Then she came to a
decision. "No. If I told her, she would hate me. Well, hate me even
more than she already does. I absolutely cannot tell her. And this
is the only way I have of showing Brooke how I feel and I'm not
prepared to give it up yet."</p>
<p>The irony of Sam's attraction to the girl she tried so hard to despise
was not lost on Harrison. He thought he now understood what was
behind Sam's attacks on all that Brooke held sacred. It was the
lesbian high school equivalent to dunking her pigtails in an ink well,
although a lot more twisted. "Ah, Sam, that's totally sad."</p>
<p>"So you understand my predicament."</p>
<p>Did he ever. If he had zero chance of achieving the time of day with
Brooke McQueen, then the probability for Sam was somewhere down in the
negative triple digits. "Yeah. Normally I wouldn't say this to a
girl, but I think it's appropriate in this case: you poor dumb bastard."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam bleakly agreed.</p>
