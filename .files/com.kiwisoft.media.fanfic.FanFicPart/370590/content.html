<p><i><b>A/N: Thanks for reading, guys! It's been a journey. Transcribing is tough business. Once again, this was taken from the book "I Want To Go Home!" by Gordon Korman. It was one of my favorites as a teenager and remains treasured to me today. Hope y'all enjoyed it. This is the very, very last chapter. No sequels, but there may be a one-shot followup if people show enough interest in me writing one.<hr size=1 noshade></b></i></p>
<p>It was the last day of camp. The girls of Camp Algonkian Island were lined up at the dock, their luggage beside them, waiting for their turn to board the launch that would take them to the mainland. From there, buses were waiting to take them home.</p>
<p>"Well," said Chantel to Trina, Marina and a group of other counselors, "so ends the most amazing term in the history of this camp."</p>
<p>"And all because of one girl," added Trina. "I've never worked so hard in my life! In the last two weeks that kid has escaped nine times! We caught her six, and three she came back on her own. And for what? She didn't want to go home."</p>
<p>"The glory of the chase," said Chantel. "I told you Stewart was a remarkable kid."</p>
<p>"She certainly is," purred Ruby. "Algonkian Island, soccer champions of California. It has a nice ring to it."</p>
<p>Marina sighed. "The memory of Miley Stewart with Lilly Truscott at her side is going to haunt us all for years."</p>
<p>Lauren chuckled in amusement. "I'll never forget how we took her to that track meet on the mainland and she won the hundred-meter dash and kept on running."</p>
<p>"We won, though," grinned Trina, "after we found her and dragged her back."</p>
<p>"She kept us well paid, you know," put in Chantel thoughtfully. "We'd chase her all over the place and in return she'd win us a game or a track meet once in a while."</p>
<p>"Speak of the devil," laughed Marina. "here come Stewart and company now."</p>
<p>Miley and Lilly approached and shook hands all around.</p>
<p>"So long, Stewart," said Marina. "It's beenâ€”interesting."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, everybody, and thanks," said Lilly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, so long, everybody," said Miley. She came face to face with Trina and smiled for the second time in a month. "'Bye, Trina," she said sweetly. "See you again next year."</p>
<p>Then she and Lilly turned and ran off towards the waiting launch.</p>
<p>Trina held her head. "Next year! Next year! Let's not let her in!"</p>
<p>Chantel laughed. "Then you'd have her breaking in instead of breaking out."</p>
<p>"Hey," said Marina, "here comes the supply boat with a big load. I don't remember anything being ordered. Let's see what they've got."</p>
<p>The launch pulled out just as the supply boat arrived at the loading dock. Marina and the group went to meet it.</p>
<p>"Hi. What have you got for us?" called Marina.</p>
<p>The delivery man produced his cargo ticket and stood scratching his head. "Volleyballs," he said. "A thousand volleyballs."</p>
<p>"Who ordered <i>those?"</i> asked Trina in disbelief.</p>
<p>"It says here <i>M. Stewart, Camp Director</i>."</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" moaned Marina, her face pale. "I forgot! I forgot to call back and cancel that order!"</p>
<p>Trina gazed at the now distant launch carrying Miley, Lilly and the other girls to the mainland. She ran to the end of the dock, waving her arms wildly.</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart! You come back here!"</i></p>
<p>On the launch, Lilly and Miley sat with their backs against a wall, watching the receding island. Lilly sighed. "I might miss that place a little," she mused.</p>
<p>Miley looked at her from the corner of her eye. "Oh yeah?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded. Miley suddenly leaned in and put her mouth up to Lilly's ear, cupping her hand around it. To anyone watching, it would just look like she was whispering something to the other girl. They'd never know Miley had just dragged her teeth across Lilly's earlobe. Lilly shuddered, and Miley fought a smirk as she let her lips brush against the shell of Lilly's ear. "I can't wait to get you home," she whispered huskily.</p>
<p>Lilly fought the blush that threatened to overtake her, trying to look natural while pushing down the desire to turn and kiss Miley with everything she had.</p>
<p>"I didn't say I'd miss it <i>that</i> much," she choked out.</p>
<p>Miley sat back, poker-faced, while Lilly collected herself.</p>
<p>It was going to be an interesting rest of the year.</p>
