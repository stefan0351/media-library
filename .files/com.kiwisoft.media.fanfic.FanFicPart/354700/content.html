<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 5 -->

<p>After his centuries of experience Angel knew there were few
things that could shock him, and yet he couldn't keep himself from
being wide-eyed with a combination of shock and fear. Looking over his
shoulder he could see Cordelia and the two slayers were in a similar
state. The slayers seemed as frightened as he was as they held hands.
As he turned back to the stage he tried to block out the sight of his
childe Spike in the middle of his rendition of the Billy Idol song
"White Wedding" singing with an alarming abandon. Cordelia was the
first to regain the power of speech. "Shouldn't that chip be going
off?" Buffy couldn't pull her eyes from the stage as she responded
over her shoulder. "I guess it only applies to him hurting humans
physically." A voice that Buffy didn't recognize replied to her
questions. "Meeeow, I don't suppose you would care to take a shot? Of
course I'm talking to a slayer so I suppose I should be more careful
with my words."</p>

<p>A taller, green skinned demon in a sharp white suit took a
drink from his drink as he sat down at their table. "Welcome to
Caritas. While I had always thought a slayer might stop by I never
thought it could be under such pleasant circumstances." Angel then
turned to him. "Actually it's not all that pleasant. We need
information." He gave the vampire a smile. "What more do you need? The
lawyers have the guardian wrapped up in red tape and it needs your
help to get out." "So the Sentinel is there?" He nodded simply and
both Cordelia and Angel looked skeptical as Cordelia spoke. "You don't
normally GIVE information away." He smiled at her. "Consider it a
gift. Though if the slayers would be good enough to grace us with a
song?'" The question was left hanging at the two girls looked at each
other while he spoke again. "I'm personally curious to see what I pick
up when I look at two slayers when there is only supposed to be one."
That got the girls attention as he stood up. "Now if you'll excuse me
it looks like Billy the Bloody is finished."</p>

<p>They all looked at each other as Faith spoke. "I just realized
that. I mean not only does he have the hair and the accent, but his
first name COULD be shortened to Billy." They all shuddered as they
forced themselves to drop the topic and look back at the stage.
"William, William, William, that was fantastic! You have the soul of a
poet!" Spike first looked alarmed and then nudged his way in front of
the microphone. "That's Spike, and I don't have a soul." There was a
round of laughter at that from the rest of the room. The slayers
didn't see Spike walk off stage because a spotlight was shined in
their faces. Faith leapt to her feet and took a defensive posture but
the light moved so it shone on the table in front of them instead of
in their eyes.</p>

<p>"Now we have some VERY special guests with us here tonight.
I'm sure we've all heard that this generation has doubled up on its
slayers." At that the rest of the room seemed to start taking
defensive postures but the host held up his hands. "Now, now, remember
our policies. The slayer have agreed to them." As the room started to
settle back down he continued. "I'm just wondering if the slayer's
would honor us with a song?" His voice then got both soft and sly. "A
duet perhaps?" The girls looked at him, and then at each other. They
kept looking at each other until Buffy sighed. "I'll go." Cordelia and
Angel were both grinning along with Faith, but Buffy turned back and
smiled sweetly at her girlfriend. "You're next sweetheart." Faith's
smile soured while Angel's and Cordelia's grew. </p>

<p>The smaller slayer got a determined look on her face as she
walked up to the stage and began searching through the song lists. She
pointed at a title and nodded once. The host had already walked over
to share a both with Spike so one of the human employees entered some
commands into a machine next to the stage. Buffy took some breaths to
steady herself and then stepped up to the microphone. She gave Faith a
shy smile, which surprised everyone at the table. When she heard the
song started she smiled softly thinking Buffy was singing her a love
song, and while in a way she was the dark slayer found her eyes
getting wide as the song continued.</p>

<p>"I watch her from my balcony."<br>
"As she dresses for their fantasies."<br>
"Men come to see her demonstrate,"<br>
"Her skills of pleasure."<br>
"Seal their fate."</p>

<p>"I can believe in pain,"<br>
"As leather bound they fall."<br>
"They seem to go insane,"<br>
"In ecstasy they call."<br>
"She lets them know,"<br>
"That she's a mistress of the night."<br>
"As they submit to gain primitive new heights."</p>

<p>"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"If she could only see how she's getting to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I've gotta give her a sign cause I've got danger on my mind now."</p>

<p>"I watch her from the balcony,"<br>
"As she plays them like a symphony."<br>
"They all bow as she makes them wait."<br>
"I want her, but I hesitate."</p>

<p>"But she deceives them all,"<br>
"As girlfriends sometimes call."<br>
"But if they only knew the ladies she pursues." <br>
"Then her emotions stir as twilight girls arrive."<br>
"They range from butch to femme,"<br>
"And they play all night."</p>

<p>"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"If she could only see how she's getting to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I've gotta give her a sign cause I've got danger on my mind now."</p>

<p>"I passed her on the street to day."<br>
"She brushed by me and looked my way."<br>
"There was a breath of innocence."<br>
"I knew this girl was different- oh yeah."</p>

<p>"Cruel and unusual."<br>
"Cruel and unusual."<br>
"Danger on my mind."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"If she could only see what she is doing to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I've gotta give her a sign cause I've got danger on my mind."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"I wanna play all night."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"What she's doin to me."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."<br>
"Danger on my mind."<br>
"She's cruel and unusual."</p>

<p>Since everyone's attention was focused on the singing slayer they
didn't what Spike was saying or what was being said to him. "They make
a cute couple don't they?" Spike shrugged. "Sexy is more like it, but
yeah they do go well together." "Doesn't mean you're not needed."
Spike's head pulled back. "What's that mean?" A smile was Spike's
first response, but the demon elaborated. "Don't be coy now. You've
fought three slayers, but only managed to kill two?" He made a
scoffing sound. "Yeah, but that's just because of her poor taste in
men." "So what? She isn't dating men anymore." Spike took a drink from
his beer. "Yeah and I can't kill anymore." "Are you saying that you
would if you could?" He laughed as he took another drink. "Are you
kidding? I could get a two for one!" This time Spike was given a
smirk. "Sure you could William."</p>

<p>The smirk remained and Spike started getting aggravated. "I could,
kill one, make the other so distraught she wouldn't even care when I
ripped her throat out." The host got up. "Who are you trying to
convince?" As he turned and walked away Spike spoke to his back. "I
could I tell you. Just two more to me' nothing special bout her, bout
either of them." He didn't notice Spike as he stepped on stage as
Buffy finished her song. "Wow, wow, wow! That was HOT! Let's get a
round of applause for Buffy the Vampire Slayer!" There was applause
and they were surprisingly enthusiastic. For her part Buffy smiled and
actually blushed slightly though it was nothing compared to the way
Faith was blushing as Buffy sat back down next to her. Cordelia chose
that moment to speak. "Wow is right." Angel seemed uncomfortable, but
he still spoke. "You reconsidering that whole girlfriend thing?"</p>

<p>"Well'" Cordelia's answer was cut off abruptly. "Now, can we get a
song from your sweetheart?" Faith found herself hauled to her feet by
Buffy. "Yes, yes you can." Buffy then kissed Faith on the cheek. "Your
turn honey. "Spike had gotten back to the table at that point but his
expression seemed haunted as he spoke to Faith. "Careful there, you're
looking paler then I am." Spike managed a grin as Faith glared over
her shoulder at him. She then took a breath, clenched her fists and
strode up to the stage. She was able to pick her song right away and
stepped up to the mic just as quickly, but when she started singing
she added her typically seductive dancing with the microphone stand as
her partner.</p>

<p>"You think you're in love."<br>
"Like it's a real sure thing."<br>
"But every time you fall,"<br>
"You get your ass in a sling."<br>
"You used to be strong,"<br>
"But now its "Oh baby please."<br>
"Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"We was making love when you told me that you loved me."<br>
"I thought ol cupid, he was taking aim."<br>
"I was believing when you told me that you loved me,"<br>
"And then you called me someone else's name."</p>

<p>"There ain't gonna be no more begin your please."<br>
"You know what I want and it ain't one of these."<br>
"Your bad to the bone and your girlfriend agrees."<br>
"That falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"Chip off the old block and your so much like your sister."<br>
"My fantasizing must be out of luck."<br>
"My own libido has been blowing a transistor."<br>
"I feel like I have been hit by a fuck."</p>

<p>"I'm jonesing on love."<br>
"Yeah I've got the disease."<br>
"You say that we will,"<br>
"But there ain't no guarantees."<br>
"I majored in love,"<br>
"But in all minor keys."<br>
"Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?"<br>
"It's got to be hardcore."<br>
"Must be some kind of Nevus Riche."<br>
"Is this your only chance?"<br>
"Or some hypnotic trance."<br>
"Let's get you on a tighter leash."</p>

<p>"You ain't that good." is what you said down to the letter."<br>
"But you like the way I hold a microphone."<br>
"Sometimes I'm good,"<br>
"But when I'm bad I'm even better."<br>
"Don't give me no lip,<br>
"I've got enough of my own."</p>

<p>"There ain't gonna be no more begin your please."<br>
"You know what I want and it ain't one of these."<br>
"Your bad to the bone and your girlfriend agrees."<br>
"That falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>"I'm jonesing on love."<br>
"Yeah I've got the disease."<br>
"You say that we will,"<br>
"But there ain't no guarantees."<br>
"I majored in love,"<br>
"But in all minor keys."<br>
"Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees."</p>

<p>As the song ended Faith was left flushed, smiling from ear to ear and
panting ever so slightly. The host quickly walked up and took the
microphone. "Now wasn't that great!" Under his breath, but close to
the mic he spoke to Faith. "The censoring is there for a reason."
Faith then laughed. "What, murderous demons are afraid of the f word?"
"Yes" She shrugged. "Whatever." Then she walked from the stage and
back to a widely grinning Buffy. "I know it got me thinking of my f
word." Faith slid her arms over the smaller slayer's shoulders and
then leaned in and whispered in Buffy's ear. "Would that word
be'Faith?" Buffy pulled back and grinned at her. "That too." Faith
grin matched Buffy's as they sat back down and Buffy spoke. "Let's
just say we'll be testing your theory, and those knees."</p>

<p>The sound of a chair scraping across the floor turned all eyes to
Angel who was on his feet and back towards the exit. "I' I gotta go."
The host was there at almost the exact same time. "Maybe you should go
with him Cordelia?" The secretary turned seer nodded and quickly
followed her boss out the door. The slayers looked about ready to do
the same as the host held up a hand. "Don't, he's a big boy, and he
has to learn to deal with it." Spike sighed dramatically. "I guess
I'll go help the poor guy out." Buffy shook her head. "The only help
you would give is twisting the knife." He nodded. "Your right there.
Fine, I'll go help myself to another beer." As Spike got up and headed
to the bar the three were left alone. "I know you girls are worried
about him, but it's the nature of his curse. He has to earn the right
to happiness." </p>

<p>Faith was looking down at the table. "I didn't." "Ah, but there's a
difference there. That's what I saw. You two know that you are each
halves of the slayer power right?" The girls nodded in unison, and he
smiled. "Part of that is that you share your karma. So Buffy, when
Kendra died you shed your slayer duties. You thought it was just
because you couldn't handle it, but on an instinctive level you knew
that there should be a new slayer." Buffy seemed to consider that.
"After I' died I had this whole bad girl phase." Faith seemed to pout.
"And I missed it?" They all seemed to laugh at that. "Actually "you"
probably were the cause of it." The slayers locked their eyes back on
him in a silent question. "Well Buffy as you know your power fractured
at that point and the darker side of the slayer powers passed on to
Kendra. On a subconscious level you knew they were missing and your
acting up was a way to try to make up for the loss."</p>

<p>Faith was confused. "So what's that got to do with me?" He smiled at
her and reached out to pat her hand. "I'm getting to you precious.
When you were doing what you did you wanted Buffy to stop you didn't
you?" Faith nodded. "I just figured that was because I still had some
trace of a conscience." He nodded. "I'm sure you did, but Angel was
trying to stop you to. You wanted Buffy to do it because you knew she
was the only one. She mitigates your darkness, and you give her the
fire to keep fighting. Without you Buffy losses the fire for the
fight, with out her you'" Faith interrupted. "Flip out?" "Not exactly.
Your slayer instincts tend to think in terms before the development of
things like laws." The girls continued to look at him and he sighed.
"When you first took a life your slayer instincts thought "threat" and
reacted. Now in this case it turned out to be wrong. Now Buffy's
verified what he was, but if he had turned out to be a threat she
could have died while making sure."</p>

<p>Buffy's lip curled. "So what? We're both flawed?" He shook his head.
"No, you're linked. You need each other to be at full strength." Faith
was looking back down at the table. "She was with me when it first
happened." He stared deeply into her eyes. "Was she?" The girls looked
at each other for a long time and then back at the demonic lounge
singer. Buffy then spoke in a quiet voice. "You mean to be together we
have to be "together"?" He grinned at the girls. "Not exactly, but the
connection has to be on a deep, primal level. Rites of passage,
ritualistic combat, vision quests, things like that. Sex is just one
of the things that connect on that level that is still popular
nowadays. So the stronger your love the stronger your slaying."</p>
