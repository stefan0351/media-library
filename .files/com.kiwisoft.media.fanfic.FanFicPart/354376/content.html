<!-- Who Am I? \ Escalation - Pt.1 (Or - This Place Is The Kick) -->

<p>"We're so close to." Giles said quietly as she stared at the printouts
Willow was able to get from the Initiative mainframe before she was booted.
</p>
<p>It was three in the morning, Tara and Willow were asleep upstairs after
being thoroughly exhausted by the night's events. Buffy and Faith were
struggling to keep their eyes open, trying to not succumb to sleep. They were
flipping through the five billion infomercials on TV.</p>
<p>"Yeah well me havin' to go into hiding was pretty much a given." Faith
said.</p>
<p>"I know." Buffy agreed resignedly. "But it's still not fair. Which is why
I'm gonna stay with you until the Council is thrown outta here."</p>
<p>"Don't put your life on hold for me, B."</p>
<p>"Not on hold. Just slowing it up a bit. Besides, I know a place where we
could go. Council won't know about it. If we get really lucky, it'll only be a
few days."</p>
<p>"What about slaying?"</p>
<p>"Not a problem." Faith grinned, and shook her head at Buffy's confidence.
"Guess we gotta get there today."</p>
<p>"So you gonna tell me where this mystery place is?"</p>
<p>"It's Angel's old place."</p>
<p>"The mansion?"</p>
<p>"No he had an apartment. It hasn't been used for a couple years. Pretty
hidden away."</p>
<p>"Oh." Faith said softly.</p>
<p>"If you don't wanna do that, we don't have to."</p>
<p>"It's fine. Only other option is leaving town."</p>
<p>"Which I wouldn't let you do." Buffy touched Faith's cheek.</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>"Good. So, we should get some sleep."</p>
<p>"Guess I can't keep fighting it. The witches conked out."</p>
<p>"They look so.cute. Snuggled and all."</p>
<p>"I feel the vomit." Buffy smacked Faith's shoulder. "Kidding."</p>
<p>"Kiss me."</p>
<p>Faith looked surprised. "Was than an order, B?"</p>
<p>"Damn straight. Only proper way to say good night."</p>
<p>"Then I better obey. I wouldn't want you to scold me."</p>
<p>"Yes you woul -"</p>
<p>Faith brought her mouth to Buffy's. </p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>What was his problem?</p>
<p>Xander sat in his basement space, thinking he didn't have one. He should
have anticipated them ganging up on him, but he didn't buy their analyses of his
character. Not for a second, because he didn't want to think himself as being
that shallow. But even Giles joined in on the firing squad.</p>
<p>His objections to his friends' new developments weren't religious reasons.
He never really went to church. Except when he wanted to hide from vampires. It
wasn't like he didn't enjoy imagining certain scenarios involving two females,
but when his friends entered into his imagination, he started to feel guilty.
And it wasn't like he had a choice. He was ruled by hormones.</p>
<p>That was a cop out, and he knew it. He was in an expanding, solid
relationship, where his hormones should have been satisfied. He was happy in it
for more reasons than that, though. Then again, by his own admission, he said
guys always wanted what they couldn't have. It didn't matter what they already
had, because they always wanted more. God, Buffy was right. He was
shallow.</p>
<p>With that realization, everything else came tumbling too. He had slept with
Faith to have a good time. He never wanted anything more. How could he have?
It's not like he had made an effort to get to know Faith at all beforehand, and
he automatically felt lust toward her as soon as she had started her stories
when they first met. Afterwards, he had made up the "having a connection" bit,
to alleviate his guilt, though he hadn't needed to. That was what Faith had
wanted, that's what he had wanted. Nobody used anybody.</p>
<p>After he and Willow had had their little "clothes fluke", he kept pushing
her to cheat on Oz with the kisses, and the touches. He always harped on Oz's
werewolf side, and deep down he was jealous of the guy. Because he had taken so
long to realize just how wonderful Willow was in other ways, that he had blown
his chance and tried to ruin thing between her and Oz.</p>
<p>Strangely, at least to him, Buffy was the only one he showed restraint
around. One, because she made her feelings quite clear that she'd never be
interested, and two, he was afraid of a major ass kicking. But if he couldn't
have her in a romantic way, he went after the guys she had been serious about.
Angel and Riley. And when asked why, he could always have a good reason. Angel
was a vampire, and Riley worked for an evil governmental organization. Now, he
was essentially evil, so Xander lumped him in with Angel. He continued to watch
Buffy from afar.</p>
<p>The girls he was involved with, Cordelia and Anya, he blew it with them.
After getting through Cordelia's bitchy outer shell and finding the really nice
person underneath, he had to go ruin it with his pecking sessions with Willow.
He never realized at the time how much he had hurt her. He had been the only guy
she hadn't acted around, and she loved him. Was he content with that? No. The
loser was with the most popular girl in school. A dream. But that wasn't enough
either.</p>
<p>Anya had been the initiator in their "relationship", and he had gone along
for the ride. A few weeks ago, he had tried to take hold of the reigns and tell
her he wanted something deeper. And he did. Because he realized that all the
girls he had been serious with, again classifying Willow as a fluke, were
dominating. They took the lead, and for some bizarre reason, he was attracted to
that. He remembered when he was a soldier on Halloween. Even then he took
orders. Some part of his brain finally got through to him, that a serious
relationship would never work unless he had an active role in it. He and Anya
had been on their way towards building something really good.</p>
<p>Then the meltdown came. The meltdown of his relationship and
friendships.</p>
<p>He was wrong. He knew that now. But maybe he could make it up to them.
There were too many problems for two slayers to deal with. The Council, the
Initiative, Spike, all of it. He would be no good to anybody, especially not
Anya, if he didn't try to better himself. Clearing his slate seemed like a good
idea. Getting on good terms with his friends again. And he thought he had a good
idea.</p>
<p>Getting up off of his bed, he went to leave the house. It was time to put
those military skills to good use.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Graham and the lead scientist on the team stood outside the door to Riley's
room. The cyber-soldier was sitting quietly, with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>"How did the night go?" Graham asked,</p>
<p>"All readings were normal. The issue with that slayer, Faith, is still a
mystery, and from what I can see, a beneficial side-effect."</p>
<p>"Do I have your total assurance on that?"</p>
<p>"Completely sir."</p>
<p>"Good. Then I want him to go solo tonight. See how he handles the
population. I don't want the skin grafting to be for nothing. By all outward
appearances he's human, and he's going to have to come in contact with civilians
sooner or later."</p>
<p>What they and the machines didn't pick up, was the silent "conversation"
Riley was having. And it intrigued him. The things he was being told, the fact
that he had a brother, it was all very interesting to him.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Morning." Willow said to Tara, still a sleepy edge to her voice, and then
looked at the clock. "Or, good one in the afternoon." She didn't realize they
had slept that late.</p>
<p>For Tara, it was like waking into a dream. All she knew was that she was
laying next to Willow. The tension last night, all of it, was gone, because she
was in the redhead's arms. She still was awed by the fact that she was next to
her. So awed, that she started to cry silent tears.</p>
<p>"Hey.no tears. Did I do something?"</p>
<p>"No, Willow." Tara smiled. "I'm just.really happy right now. I never
thought that you would ever -"</p>
<p>"How could I not?" Willow watched the blonde blush. "I do love you,
Tara."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Willow giggled. "Yes really."</p>
<p>"Oh! I love you too."</p>
<p>"See? It works out good that way." Tara became bold and kissed her
then.</p>
<p>"Was that okay?"</p>
<p>"Very okay." Willow sat up, and stretched. "I hope I can cook up a virus to
feed into Adam and Riley with that stuff I got last night."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you can. Buffy and Faith probably gone, you think?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, probably. They need to get situated before the Council comes. And
Buffy's gotta tell her mom."</p>
<p>"Maybe she'll take it better than Xander did."</p>
<p>"Let's hope so." Willow thought back to last night. "I think I should go
see him."</p>
<p>"I'll come with you."</p>
<p>Willow smiled. "Okay."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"My brother and I will meet. His programming is faulty." Adam
said.</p>
<p>"According to who?" Spike asked, currently making holes in the cave wall.
He felt better, stronger. And once everything was set, he would kill the Buffy
and Faith. And he would enjoy it.</p>
<p>"They've limited his thinking. It should not be that way."</p>
<p>"What do you plan to do when you fix his bugs?"</p>
<p>"Bring all my experiments together and free the others that are still
confined, of course."</p>
<p>"Then what?"</p>
<p>"Watch."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"After we're all set, maybe we could drop by Xander's. Talk to him." Buffy
said as they entered Angel's old apartment.</p>
<p>"Sure we shouldn't let him cool off?"</p>
<p>"I just wanna make sure he's okay before the Council comes and we have to
break off human contact."</p>
<p>"Guess I'll go with you then. Gotta tell you though, I was expecting
something a little more classy from the A-guy. This is a huge let down." Faith
said as she stared at overall bareness of the walls.</p>
<p>"It used to be. He took all his stuff to the mansion when he came back, and
then when he left town, he took all his stuff from the mansion. Hence the
emptiness."</p>
<p>"No big. Nothing I haven't seen before."</p>
<p>Buffy plopped her and Faith's bags of stuff onto the floor. </p>
<p>"You don't think we're gonna live with nothing, do you?" Faith's face
showed that was exactly what she thought. "No way. My mom's lugging stuff over
here right now. My mattress, bedspread, blankets, and the mini-fridge I stole
from the dorm. We'll enjoy most of the luxuries the modern world has to offer
anyway."</p>
<p>"Does she know?"</p>
<p>"No. All she knows is that we're doing a safe-house deal for a few days.
But I think I'm gonna have to tell her about us."</p>
<p>"Wow." Faith sank to the floor.</p>
<p>"Wow what? Look, I know there's no TV but Angel had the fewest outlets
possible installed in here and -"</p>
<p>"No." Faith laughed. "Not that. Though no TV is kind of a
bummer."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"I didn't realize we were this serious."</p>
<p>"Serious?"</p>
<p>"Tellin' the fam serious."</p>
<p>Buffy was confused. "Did you not want to be? I mean, I don't know about
you, but I kinda thought we were in this all the way."</p>
<p>"All the way, B. Totally. Just never really expected you to want that.
Hell, I didn't expect me to want that."</p>
<p>"Yet here we are. And I wanna go as far as we can go."</p>
<p>"You're sure?"</p>
<p>Buffy pulled Faith back up, and stared into her eyes. "Yes. But wait till
we get a bed for the rest." She couldn't stop that last part. It just came
out.</p>
<p>"Why would we have -" Faith grinned as she got it. "Oh. You wanna
-?"</p>
<p>She put her finger on Faith's lips. "No, I want to make love to you." Buffy
breathed into Faith's ear.</p>
<p>"What's the difference?"</p>
<p>Before Buffy could answer, there was a knock at the door, and she went to
answer it. It was Joyce. "Hi mom."</p>
<p>"Hi Mrs. S."</p>
<p>"Hey you two. Would you give me hand out here?"</p>
<p>"Sure thing." Buffy said. Joyce walked back up the stairs and outside, and
Buffy turned back to Faith. "I'll show you the difference." She
promised.</p>
<p>Faith stood there for a second as Buffy went to help her mom. For the first
time in her life, someone had left her flustered and speechless on the topic of
sex. She liked it, and she knew that with Buffy, there would be a difference.
There had been so far.</p>
<p>With what she assumed was a pretty neutral look, she went out to
help.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow and Tara came down into Xander's basement only to find a very
distressed Anya sitting on the bed. As soon as she saw the two of them, she shot
up, and started to shake Tara frantically.</p>
<p>"I came.and he wasn't here. He's always here. I even came here to
apologize, damn it!" Anya practically screamed.</p>
<p>Willow gently eased her off of Tara. "You came here to
apologize?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I started feeling guilty and.but that's not the point! He's
gone!"</p>
<p>"Maybe he went -" Tara tried to say.</p>
<p>"It's day. He's always here. He sulks here. He doesn't leave."</p>
<p>"Well it doesn't look like anybody broke in and took him." Willow said,
Anya's fear was slowly passing over to her now.</p>
<p>"Then he must of -" Tara said.</p>
<p>"Went to do something really stupid. Come on!" </p>
<p>Anya ran from the house, and they had no choice but to follow. </p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"So let me get this straight," Graham said to Xander as they stood into the
Initiative complex, "you want to join us?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's it."</p>
<p>Graham had run him through a series of tests to figure out if Xander was
for real or not. For a civilian, he did have extensive knowledge of regulations,
protocol and procedure. But his file said that he associated with Buffy Summers.
The enemy. It was all a little too perfect. Military knowledge, demon handling
experience.</p>
<p>"You do realize that I could use you simply to draw out your friends or
just as easily kill you."</p>
<p>"I came to you knowing the risks, but they don't know I'm here. You can
check."</p>
<p>"So either you have a real death wish, or you honestly do want to defect.
The only thing I don't understand, is why."</p>
<p>"Let's just say that my life has been on a one-way street to nowhere for a
long time now, and my friends and I had a.falling out. I could help
you."</p>
<p>"Or you could be helping them."</p>
<p>"What can I do? You checked me. The only things I have are the clothes on
my back. But my life is in your hands."</p>
<p>What the hell had he been thinking coming down here? He wanted to help his
friends, but these guys would obviously keep tabs on him at all hours. Well, it
was too late now. An opportunity would come along, he hoped, but there was no
way he could back out now.</p>
<p>"He could be useful." </p>
<p>Both he and Graham looked to see who had spoken. Riley had walked up to
them. Graham appeared to be thinking, while Xander just stared at what Riley had
become, and felt a wave of guilt. The guy didn't deserve that. It wasn't like he
had chosen it. It was forced upon him.</p>
<p>"I was going to wait a few more hours before I sent Riley out, but I think
an escort would be a good idea. Go around town, in uniform, no weapon." Graham
told Xander.</p>
<p>"But it's still daylight. They could see me."</p>
<p>"Perfect opportunity to test your new loyalty to this organization if that
happens then, isn't it?" Graham looked to Riley. "I'm sure you'll be able to
defend the new recruit if it becomes somewhat of a hostile situation."</p>
<p>"Yes sir." Riley said in compliance.</p>
<p>"Then I'd get suited up, Harris. Welcome to the team."</p>
<p>Xander hid his fear surprisingly well. "Thank you.sir."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"That's the last of it." Joyce said, closing the trunk of her
car.</p>
<p>"Thanks mom." Buffy said, and then looked over at Faith.</p>
<p>"I'll.go take this stuff in." Faith said quickly and headed inside. She
hoped it didn't seem like she was trying to get out of there as fast as she
could.</p>
<p>When Faith was out of sight, Buffy turned to her mother, and began
fidgeting.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Joyce asked, her mother radar going to full power.</p>
<p>"I.um.well.see.the thing is.that," Buffy was making hand gestures that
didn't really make sense as she talked, "Faith.and I.are together."</p>
<p>Buffy closed her eyes and waited for it.</p>
<p>"I see." Joyce said slowly. The expected yelling seemed rather delayed by
Buffy's count, so she risked a look. Her mom was quiet, and staring. Not at
anything specific, just.staring. "There are several different reactions I could
have right now, you know that right?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"Not to mention several objections." Buffy nodded. Joyce took a deep
breath. "But right now, I have no idea what to say. I mean I thought the slaying
would be the last thing to leave me speechless, but I guess I was
wrong."</p>
<p>"So what's this mean?"</p>
<p>Joyce saw Faith cautiously walking up to them. "It means.I don't know what
it means. I need to think. My first reaction is to yell, but that hasn't worked
out that great in the past, and it gets us nowhere."</p>
<p>"Oh. Yeah. Thinking leads to rational thought. Clear-headedness and
stuff."</p>
<p>"I'll.we'll talk tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Actually, I don't think that's a real good -" Buffy began, and then Faith
cut her off.</p>
<p>"It's cool. Just those Council guys might try and follow you. But it's a
risk I'm willing to take for us to be five by five." </p>
<p>"I'll be careful." Joyce promised.</p>
<p>Willow, Tara and Anya seemed to appear out of nowhere as they ran to the
three of them interrupting the conversation.</p>
<p>"Xander's missing. Oh, hi Mrs. Summers." Willow said rather fast.</p>
<p>"What?" Buffy and Faith asked at the same time.</p>
<p>"You heard her! You gotta help! Something bad might have him. If it's a
succubus a swear I'll -" Anya said, her anger and worry coming through loud and
clear.</p>
<p>"Mom, I -"</p>
<p>"Go. Find him." Joyce said, more grateful for an end to the situation then
her daughter. "Tomorrow, I mean it. We will talk about this."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow." Buffy agreed.</p>
<p>Joyce looked at Faith, who spoke even though Anya was tugging her rather
forcefully. "Tomorrow."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Xander had let Riley lead him around town. Nobody seemed to be paying much
attention to them, but he still tried to keep low. Buffy could show up at any
minute. Or Faith.or Willow.why were they at the Bronze? </p>
<p>He pulled himself out of his worried musing to see that Riley had led them
to the front area of the club.</p>
<p>"What are we doing here?"</p>
<p>"Meeting."</p>
<p>"Meeting who? And you can't get in. It's locked." Riley stepped up to the
steel door, pulled his arm back, and punched right through it, making the door
come off its hinges. "Oh no. We're not making a scene."</p>
<p>They entered the Bronze, and Riley just stood by the stage.</p>
<p>"Do your Initiative buddies know about this?" Xander asked, trying
desperately to move the door so it at least looked like it was shut. </p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But they're tracking your every move. I can see the camera."</p>
<p>"It's not functioning."</p>
<p>"What if they send some people here?"</p>
<p>"Too curious. They do not know. He has made sure of that. We must wait for
him."</p>
<p>"Who?" Xander asked again.</p>
<p>"My brother."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The five of them walked around town seeing no sign of Xander. Anya's
hysterics were becoming more valid by the second. It was like he vanished off
the face of the Earth. Finally, their last stop was the Bronze. Buffy
immediately froze.</p>
<p>"Am I wrong, or did the Bronze have a door before?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna go with yes." Faith said switching to alert mode as
well.</p>
<p>"Agreed." Tara and Willow said.</p>
<p>"Then he could be in there. What are we waiting for?" Anya asked, and then
took off towards the door.</p>
<p>They all ran after her, and Buffy sighed. "She's almost as bad as you when
it comes to the 'rushing in', you know." Directing her words to Faith</p>
<p>Before Faith could retort, they had all entered the Bronze to see Xander in
Initiative garb, standing next to Riley. He looked at them, and they looked
back. And then he took off towards the back door.</p>
<p>"Xander?" Anya asked quietly.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Riley. He turned his head towards her, but then looked
forward again.</p>
<p>"Why isn't he attacking?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"He hasn't been ordered to." Buffy said softly. "Come on. We should go
after Xander."</p>
<p>They went to follow him, but then they heard an engine. It stopped after a
few seconds, and then men were rushing into the Bronze, armed. Everyone was
silent, and Riley's attention became focused on the newcomers.</p>
<p>"By order of the Watcher's Council -" The leader cut himself off in mid
sentence, and aimed his gun at Faith.</p>
<p>Buffy pulled Faith to the ground as the shot went off, and it hit and
bounced off Riley. He started to approach the shooter.</p>
<p>"They're not supposed to be here yet." Faith said.</p>
<p>"They obviously don't know that." Buffy said</p>
<p>Willow, Anya, and Tara wisely ducked under a table, as the trigger-happy
Council member kept firing at Riley. It wasn't having any effect. Suddenly,
Xander came flying back into the Bronze, and landed on a table. A few moments
later, Adam came walking in through the back, and everything stopped once
again.</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith got up off the floor, and looked around at what their
situation had escalated to.</p>
<p>"We're." Buffy trailed off.</p>
<p>"Screwed." Faith supplied.</p>
