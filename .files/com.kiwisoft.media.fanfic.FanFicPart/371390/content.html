<p>Author's note: Jeez, you people are too damn nice to be true! Its almost suspicious... Anyway, thanks for the reviews. I hope I am able to write this thing up to your expectations :)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I don't own it, GOSH! (pouts in a corner)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"Thanks again for helping us out, Olivia!" Paul whispered to the blond next to him from behind their menu. Olivia shrugged and waved it off.</p>
<p>"No problem. It's for Viola so I'm happy to help." Olivia whispered back with a self conscious smile. Paul smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>"Why do I get the feeling you'd do a lot more for Viola if you got the chance?" Paul teased. "Or should I say you'd do a lot more<i> to</i> Viola?"</p>
<p>"Focus on the plan." Olivia sidetracked to get this guy off her trail. Was she really that obvious? She'd only just met Paul tonight for the 'big plan' and he could already see right through her!</p>
<p>Paul snickered before he lowered the food menu to peek out at Cesario's customers. They were sitting at a discreet table in a corner of the restaurant to give them a good view point of all the events that were to take place. Many Illyria students were milling about, the main targets already seated in a booth just ahead, which consisted of Duke, Toby, and Andrew. Viola's soccer team members.</p>
<p>"You remember your part of the plan?" Paul asked as he glanced over at the fidgeting debutant. Olivia nodded, feeling nervous for the first time. "Okay. Places, and... Action." he whispered into his communication device.</p>
<p>Just then Viola strutted onto the scene, looking for all she was worth a 'man with a plan'. Olivia giggled slightly at Viola's entrance and the mortified looks of Duke and his group of friends. It was just so weird to see her dressed as a guy and having other people actually believe it. She had to give credit to Viola's friends who were in on this stunt for pulling it off. Viola (aka Sebastian), stopped in front of Duke's booth.</p>
<p>"'Sup guys." she greeted in her fake guy voice.</p>
<p>"'Sup." the others echoed off-handedly while trying to look cool.</p>
<p>"Go Kia." Paul whispered. On cue, Kia slid out of another booth and approached Viola.</p>
<p><i>Step one: Kia hits on Sebastian</i>, Olivia mentally recounted the steps of the plan. She tried not to notice the slightly jealous feeling she got as she watched Kia enthusiastically put her hands all over Viola's body. After what seemed like forever, the girl finally departed with a deep and mournful sigh.</p>
<p>"Thak you, Kia. You're gorgeous." Paul remarked as Kia herself winked in their direction. "Go, Yvonne."</p>
<p>"Women," Viola said nonchalantly as the guys stared at her in open surprise.</p>
<p>"Sebastian!" Yvonne approached Viola with a sway of her hips.</p>
<p><i>Step two: Yvonne hits on Sebastian, </i>Olivia recited in her head, eyes watching where the hands were going. <i>Stop it,</i> she mentally commanded herself as she shook her head slightly to be rid of the jealousy.</p>
<p>"I'll never forget you!" Yvonne declared rather loudly and dramatically. "Never!" The dark girl received a slap on the butt from Viola as a farewell.</p>
<p>"Needy." Viola said to the stunned audience with a confident smirk. Andrew and Toby started nodding in agreement. Duke was still looking like the world was being taken over by talking apes.</p>
<p>"Okay, we might have to do a bit of a reevaluation here." Duke said to his table. Paul glanced at Olivia with an expectant look.</p>
<p>"Your cue, Blondie." Paul said with an excited look. It was clear he was enjoying himself immensely. Olivia gulped in sudden anxiety before she remembered what the previous two girls had done. She stood up from the table and made her way over to Viola. She would not let Kia and Yvonne show her up in displaying her attraction for the boy-clad girl. That was her department, dammit!</p>
<p>"Hey Sebastian." Olivia purred as she slipped her arms around Viola's waist. "Whats taking you so long? I've already saved our table."</p>
<p>The eyes of the three guys sitting in the booth bulged out of their heads. Was <i>Olivia Lennox</i>- the hottest girl in school- actually on a date with <i>Sebastian</i>?</p>
<p>"Hey Olivia." Viola greeted back as she slipped her own arm around Olivia's waist."I was just saying 'whats up' to my fellow soccer buddies here. I didn't mean to keep a beautiful girl waiting." Viola smiled flirtatiously down at her and Olivia couldn't help but blush slightly.</p>
<p>"Wait a second," Duke spoke up. "You're here to meet Olivia?" he adressed Sebastian in a slightly hurt tone. Viola seemed to hesitate for a split second before grinning confidently at her room mate.</p>
<p>"That's how I roll, dog!" Duke's expression seemed to darken and Viola backtracked. "I mean, man. Home slice. Bro?" Viola stumbled nervously over her words as Duke continued staring at her. Viola had known that Duke had a crush on the girl next to her. But didn't everyone? Olivia finally intervened.</p>
<p>"Yes, I asked Sebastian out. I figured it was about time a real man showed up at Illyria." Olivia said looking up at Viola the whole time. Viola smile gratefully at her.</p>
<p>"I can't believe this." Duke muttered to himself. "Its like the twilight zone or something."</p>
<p>"Who the hell are you?" A new voice joined the conversation.</p>
<p>"Oh crap." Viola said as she ducked behind Olivia. "Its my brother's girlfriend, Monique!" she whispered into Olivia's ear. A girl now stood in front of Olivia, eyes burning with Hell's fire.</p>
<p>"That's my boyfriend you were all over, bitch!" Monique screeched at her while getting in her face. Olivia pushed her away and glared at her. She was getting pissed off herself.</p>
<p>"What the hell? Sebastian doesn't want you anymore! And I can see why." Olivia said nastily to the surprise of everyone watching. Monique looked like she wanted to scratch her eyes out.</p>
<p>"Sebastian, who is this bitch? Are you cheating on me?" Monique demanded. Viola was hiding her face behind Olivia's back, knowing that if Monique saw her up close she would recognize her. She had to get her away from Olivia as well.</p>
<p>"Its over, Monique!" Viola said while dashing away from the scene. Monique stalked after her as Viola hid her face behind various objects. "You're hot, Monique. Smoking hot!" Viola called out as she ran behind the counter. "But you have absolutely nothing else to offer!" she said as she grabbed a stack of pizza boxes and forced them into Monique's arms. "But when I close my eyes, I see you for what you truly are which is ugly! We're done!" Viola declared as she stood next to Olivia once again.</p>
<p>Monique dropped the boxes with a shriek and made a beeline towards Olivia. "This is all your fault, isn't it!" With a swing of her hand she smacked Olivia across the face. Olivia was momentarily shocked before she retaliated by smacking Monique back. Before everyone in the restaurant knew it, the two girls were engaged in an all out knock-down hair-pulling smack-down.</p>
<p>The whole restaurant was now in an uproar as the two brawlers knocked over chairs and tables in the mist of their battle. Viola, Paul, Kia and Yvonne were the ones trying to separate the two girls. Toby and Andrew were busy imagining the fight taking place in a vat full of jello. Duke was still fuming about the fact that his dorky roommate turned out to be a ladies man and managed to snag the girl he had been crushing on first.</p>
<p>Viola's crew finally managed to seperate the two fighters. Paul and the others ran a fuming Monique out the restaurant doors. "This isn't over!" Monique called over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Olivia, get a hold of yourself!" Viola said as she led the blond girl away from the scene. "Calm down, shes not worth it."</p>
<p>"She started it." Olivia grumbled. She held up up a handful of hair and dropped it to the floor with a disgusted look on her face. "That was not ladylike at all." Viola sat her down at one of the tables.</p>
<p>"Are you okay? She didn't hurt you? Is anything hurting? How many fingers am I holding up?" Olivia waved away the questions.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, really. She got the worst of it anyway." Olivia said, a small smirk emerging on her features. Viola breathed a sigh of relief and smiled back.</p>
<p>"That's my girl." Viola whispered, pushing a lock of hair that had come loose during the fight behind her ear. Olivia blushed and looked away shyly.</p>
<p>"Hastings, you the man!" Andrew declared as he came up behind Viola and gave her a good slap on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Yeah man, that was sweet! You had two hot chicks fighting over you! You're my new idol!" Toby said as he gave Viola a high five. Viola herself was taking the attention in stride and grinned like its happened to her a million times. Olivia wouldn't be surprised if it has.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, you know how I roll homies!" she brushed imaginary lint off her shoulder and Olivia rolled her eyes in amusement. "Listen guys, I'm going to take this beautiful girl home. No girl is going to have a bad night out on my watch." She said with a wink in Olivia's direction. The two guys nodded enthusiastically as Viola led Olivia out of the restaurant by the hand. Applause and cheers from the other occupants of the establishment followed them out.</p>
<p>"That went well, don't you think?" Viola said with an impish grin, her voice reverting back to its natural girlish tone as they walked out of Cesario's.</p>
<p>"If you mean that your popularity status just skyrocketed with that stunt in there, then yeah. Mission accomplished." Olivia answered.</p>
<p>"All thanks to you, Liv." Viola said affectionately as she put her arm around the other girl's shoulder. "That fight with Sebastian's dumb girlfriend was really the cherry on top of the whole thing. The crowd loved it!"</p>
<p>"Your welcome?" Olivia said uncertainly and Viola laughed.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you actually went at it with Monique. I've always wanted to do that."</p>
<p>"Happy to help any way I can." Olivia said sarcastically, but she couldn't bring herself to feel any anger at the taller girl since Viola looked so pleased with her.</p>
<p>"And actually, it was kinda hot." Viola admitted. Olivia looked surprised.</p>
<p>"Really?" Viola suddenly looked embarrassed and scratched the back of her neck nervously as a blush invaded her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Well, you know, from a guy's perspective. Guys find girl fights hot, right? That's what I meant. You were hot. Not that you don't always look hot, but you were particularly hot when you stood up for me. You know what I mean? Of course you don't, you're not a dude. But neither am I so... I was just saying that the guys in there probably found it hot. Or something..." Viola trailed off in her ramble, stopping herself while she was ahead. Olivia just looked amused.</p>
<p>"I'll just nod and pretend that made sense." Olivia said with a smirk. Though inside she was pleased that Viola admitted that she was hot. Sort of in a weird way. But it was a start. She snuggled closer to Viola as they walked further away from Cesario's.</p>
<p>"So... I guess I'm going to be considered your girlfriend now." Olivia said quietly as she looked up at Viola shyly. Viola gulped.</p>
<p>"I... guess." she responded fleetingly.</p>
<p>"That should be interesting, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
<p>"Maybe we should... Practice?"</p>
<p>"Look, a quarter!" Viola suddenly said and broke away from Olivia to grab a quarter in the street. Olivia watched in bewilderment as Viola narrowly escaped getting hit by a honking car, grabbed a coin from pavement, then dash back, jumping over the hood of another car that skidded to a halt at her sudden appearance. Viola ran back to Olivia and held up the coin proudly.</p>
<p>"See? Its a quarter." Viola said, slightly out of breath.</p>
<p>"Actually, it's a nickel." Olivia said with a frown. Did Viola rather get hit by a car than discuss practicing their fake relationship? Olivia felt slightly hurt by that. Viola looked at the nickel in her hand in disappointment.</p>
<p>"Oh, nevermind then." Viola laughed nervously as she tossed the coin away from her. "I should get you to your dorm, its getting late." she said as she walked off ahead of Olivia. The blond girl sighed in irritation and followed her new reluctant 'boyfriend'.</p>
<p>"Looks like we got our work cut out for us."</p>
