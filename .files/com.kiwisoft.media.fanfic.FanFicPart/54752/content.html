<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>Faith had many reasons for staking vampires. It was her duty;
it was her nature, and the fact it was a rush to pit herself against
them in mortal combat. It was however the first time she wanted to
stake one for being so damn nice to her. While she had no intention of
actually staking Angel the fact that he drove to Sunnydale, prepared
the mansion, made a bank withdrawal, and even went shopping for her
just blew her away. Humans weren't this nice to her, yet here was a
blood drinking creature of the night doing everything he could think
of to give her a second chance at life. Faith realized this was one of
the first things she had to learn. That it's one thing to be self
reliant, and another thing to cut yourself off from others.</p>

<p>She found his kindness reaffirming some belief in the kindness
of others. She also was glad it was Angel she was dealing with. Of all
those she mad met since coming to Sunnydale he seemed the only one
with any taste in clothes, and it showed in the clothes he picked up
for her. Now she was standing there in the front area of Angel
Investigations as Angel and Wesley were fussing over her before she
left. Angel was his normally stoic self, with only the lightest touch
of warmth in his eyes, but for Faith it was obvious enough. Wesley on
the other hand was fussing over her like a father whose daughter was
leaving for college. While she wasn't headed for college, as least not
in the typical sense, she was restarting her life. The presence of the
two men seemed fitting some how.</p>

<p>She had a father figure, and a FAR older brother, and the fact
they were there to see her off made her smile, even as she tried to
hide it under her normally detached expression. Angel spoke. "Ready?"
Faith took a deep breath, paused, and then nodded. "Yeah, I'll just
head down to the bus station…" Both men's expressions looked like they
were about to disagree and Faith stopped. Wesley spoke next. "Since
the sun is out Angel will not be able to accompany you, but I would
like to drive you to Sunnydale if I may." She couldn't keep the smile
from her face, but she did keep it shy. "Are you sure Wes? I mean I
honestly don't mind taking the bus." Wesley simply smiled. "It's not
that long of a trip, and I think we would both enjoy the company."</p>

<p>The two stepped from Angel's office and into the rays of dawn.
She looked into the vampire's face as he stood in the shade of the
entryway. "Thanks Angel, Goodbye." He smiled back at her. "Good luck."
She smiled and turned to Wesley as they climbed into the car and he
started the engine. From that point on the engine was the only sound,
both of the people seeming caught up in their own thoughts. At least
until Faith expressed one of those thoughts. "Wesley, I woke up when
you looked in on me." The former watcher seemed to start stuttering
out an apology but fell silent when she smiled sadly. "It's ok. I just
want to let you know I hold nothing against you, not any more. If I
want to earn the forgiveness of others I have to be willing to forgive
them, and I know all about being raised one way and thinking that was
the only way things were done."</p>

<p>He nodded sadly as she continued. "So don't let it bother you
any more. Ok?" He gave her a glance. "I don't think it's that easy.
While I thank you for your forgiveness I don't think I can forgive
myself, but that's good in a way. It's what led me to agree with
Angel's decision to help you, and I hope the memory of how I failed
you will cause me to go the distance to help others." She blinked at
him several times. "Well know that I'm not holding anything against
you." He smiled and chuckled softly. "Noted." The two lapsed into
silence again, but it was a far more comfortable kind and it remained
until they saw the sign announcing they were entering Sunnydale.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" Faith laughed nervously as she seemed to
focus on remembering to breathe. "Not really, but I'll think of
something." Wesley smiled and laid a free hand on her shoulder.
"Remember Faith, I believe in you, Angel believes in you." She nodded
and swallowed as they entered town and Wesley directed the car to
Angel's mansion. As they pulled up Faith's heart skipped a beat,
though to her it felt like it stopped when she saw the all too
familiar form sitting outside waiting. Wesley's face seemed to harden
when he saw Buffy Summers, and if Faith didn't know better it looked
as if he were ready to fight the small blonde slayer for her. The
hostile expression and body language remained as he got out of the car
and was mirrored as Buffy stood up.</p>

<p>It actually left Faith feeling odd, being the calm one, but it
also let her know that she needed to do this. It was almost as if her
anger was some infectious disease that she passed on to anyone who
came near her. Buffy strode up to them. "I thought you were coming
alone Faith." Wesley was the one to answer. "I thought she had been
alone enough already and offered to drive her here." It was then Buffy
seemed to fully acknowledge the presence of the one time watcher.
Buffy tilted her head. "I thought you didn't get involved. Isn't that
against policy?" He took an angry breath to reply, but Faith seemed to
realize she had to head it off before either gained any steam. "Thanks
for driving me Wes. I'll just grab my stuff and you can get going."</p>

<p>Both Buffy and Wesley seemed stunned, but the spell broke and
he helped her while Buffy stood watch over the two of them. As they
settled her few bags into the main living area he smiled and stepped
close to her, ignoring the slayer watching them both. "You can do this
Faith. Take care of yourself and never be afraid to call on me for
help." Faith actually blushed and nodded, which caused then her former
watcher to smile fondly. He then turned and walked out. When Faith
turned to look at Buffy she could see confusion all over Buffy's face.
Faith's gaze seemed to break into Buffy's thoughts and she focused on
Faith once more, the hard expression slipping back like it had never
left. "Don't worry B. Three days and I'm gone." </p>

<p>Buffy's expression never wavered, but she seemed to need to
steel herself. "That's right. Three days and I want you gone." Faith
nodded. "You're the boss. I can try to make it two if you would want
me to just apologize to them all at once." Buffy glared back as she
responded. "Again with the attitude!" Faith's eyes flickered. "Yours
or mine?" As Buffy seemed about to snap back a reply Faith sighed.
"I'm sorry B. That's the whole problem, your attitude, mine, mostly
mine. You didn't have to let me come here at all. Thank you for that."
The look of anger on Buffy's face vanished and now she looked as if
she had been slapped. Her eyes wide and disbelieving and locked on
Faith. "All right, your welcome." Faith kept her eyes on the ground as
she spoke again. "I did mean that earlier. I can be out of your hair
faster if you just want to call a Scooby meeting. I figure I can
apologize there, swing by and tell your mom I'm sorry, and be out by
the next morning."</p>

<p>She nodded. "That's probably for the best. I don't know if
they would want to be alone with you." The words stung Faith, and to
her surprise Buffy felt a pang of regret at that. "We were already
going to meet at Giles house at noon, why don't you come by at one?"
Faith nodded and when she looked up she found the other slayer staring
at her. "What?" Buffy seemed startled. "Nothing." She then turned
around and walked out. Faith rolled shoulders that had become
uncomfortably tight and started unpacking. Though she didn't unpack
much as she expected she could be leaving in the morning. Part of her
wanted to lay down and take a nap, but instead she found herself
moving in front of the fireplace and making herself a cleared area.</p>

<p>Slowly she took up the few Tai Chi maneuvers Angel had taught
her before she had left that morning. He always said it helped him to
focus and right now that was exactly what she needed. As she carried
out the slow moving motions she found that the moving meditation was
also a fine work out. Not like her sparring sessions with B, but good.
Unknown to her another person was recalling those training sessions as
they watched her. Buffy probably knew the mansion as well as Angel did
and was easily able to find a spot that allowed her to watch Faith
unobserved. She told herself it was to see if she did anything
suspicious once she thought that she was alone, but all she did was
that slow motion martial art Angel liked to do.</p>

<p>Five minutes turned into ten, ten minutes turned into fifteen
and as Buffy watched she forgot why she was watching. Instead of
looking for something suspicious she was remembering a time before
they were ever suspicious of each other. She remembered patrolling
together, and training together. Still it was more then that, Faith
was not just another slayer, she was Buffy's age, and unlike Kendra
she really was Buffy's age instead of just being similar in years. Her
anger had faded and Buffy almost wanted to cry, this is what she had
hoped for. This was what she wanted when Faith came out of her coma.
Then so many things happened and Buffy got so angry, but she also got
to see the world through Faith's eyes. She forgave Faith when they
were in the hospital together, now she wondered if she could do it
again.</p>

<p>Her reverie was broken as Faith stopped but it wasn't until
Faith grabbed a towel and headed towards the shower that she was able
to think again. It was then that she realized that she had spent an
hour watching the other slayer. Shaking her head she realized she
would have to break into an all out run in order to get to Giles
house, and even then she was probably going to be late. Her head
jerked up as she heard the shower turn on and she took that as her cue
that she could start running with out being overheard. She forced her
mind from thinking about Faith to thinking about what the rest were
going to think about Faith.</p>
