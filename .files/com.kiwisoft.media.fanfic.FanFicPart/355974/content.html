<!-- Il Loro: Il Bruciando Ballo, Il Ballo Burrascoso \ Act II: A friend in need... -->

<p><b>Scene 1: The insights of a leader?</b></p>

		<p>Finally, I watch the last few trickle out of the holodeck.  It has been a long evening, a long day before that too, but I have a feeling that the hardest part is still to come.  I can't just let everything lie as it is.  I am just not that way.  Tom, Harry and Chakotay are the only ones left with me in the program.  I mutter a 'thank you, gentlemen' in what I hope is a sincere tone, in hopes that they will leave me alone to collect my thoughts.</p>

		<p>I look up to discover that Harry and Tom have taken their cue, but as the pilot is about to cross the threshold into the corridor he looks back at me.  There is a look in his eyes that says he knows I am going to do something.  Within that look there is also a hope laid bare for me.  I have pulled Tom out of too many problems, pulled us all out of the fire by sheer Midwestern cussedness far too many times, and the young man has a somewhat blind faith in me.  It is, at once, both flattering and extraordinarily frightening.  I nod at him and he turns, leaving me alone with my First Officer.</p>

		<p>"Kathryn," Chakotay begins and I know I'm not going to like the rest.  He has that look on his face again that tells me he thinks he is being charming.  "Will you allow me to escort you back to your quarters?"</p>

		<p>He holds his hand out and maybe the gesture could have been romantic years ago but now I cannot stand the thought.  I don't know why every couple of years he tries once again to court me.  It only goes to show how little he knows me if he thinks that once he gave up the first time he ever had another chance.  Besides, I have noticed too many of his flaws over the years and have found him considerably lacking.  I don't need a partner who cannot make up his own mind.  He may be daring behind a phaser, or even the helm of a ship, but elsewhere he hasn't the decision-making abilities of my Irish Setter back home in Indiana.</p>

		<p>"No, but thank you Chakotay.  I want to spend a moment more here by myself... and then I have a matter or two to attend to before I turn in."  I answer him as politely as I can.  I try to never be brutal with his affections.  I don't think it would be very good for the environment on the bridge.</p>

		<p>"The evening was wonderful Kathryn.  You should allow yourself the rest.  There is nothing that needs immediate attention and Tuvok handles the conn just fine without us."  He retorts.  They are weak, inane arguments that are not the least bit insightful.  When this man misses the boat, he usually cannot even see the water.</p>

		<p>I sigh and look him in the eyes.  "This isn't really ship's business my friend.  Just something I feel I have to do."</p>

		<p>He seems to understand, or at least he pretends to now.  "Of course... Well, another time perhaps.  Good night, Kathryn."  The man actually looks like he wants to come and kiss my hand, but I think it is clear I won't let him when I cross my hands behind my back and turn away.</p>

		<p>"Good night."</p>

		<p>As I hear the doors finally sliding shut, I feel a measure of privacy.  Maybe I can find some resolution to my thoughts.  They have been direly troubled since my Chief Engineer and Astrometrics officer left the party.  I have no idea what brought them together, to dance as they had.  Now, I can almost sense each woman's pain from decks away.  It does not help matters any that I am so close to both women.</p>

		<p>My Chief Engineer and I have a special relationship.  I had taken B'Elanna in as something akin to a daughter during our voyage's first couple of years... well as close to a daughter as I ever wanted.  Yet, over time our relationship matured and now we are friends.  It is a nice thing to have aboard... a female friend that is.  After Kes left and until B'Elanna and I grew to be friends, I had no female friends.</p>

		<p>Then there's Seven.  When we first found her in that Borg cube she was raw.  When I took her away from all that she had known, I accepted that she would be my responsibility.  I just had no idea how much she would drive me crazy that first year.  That year, she saw more of the inside of the Brig, Sickbay and Cargo Bay 2 than the rest of the ship.  After time, she began to settle in and she began to rely on me more often for guidance.  She eventually surprised me by showing me how very deeply her emotions ran, how truly human she already was.  She was so naíve and pure that it would sometimes make me ache.</p>

		<p>I admit, after a while I became enamored with her.  I wasn't alone in that.  I think she stole a few hearts and never even realized it.  Her strength, intelligence, conviction and beauty captivated me in equal measures.  However, I realized quite quickly that I could never be what she needed, probably not even what she would want.  No, an old tied-down captain of a starship was definitely not the right match for my young friend.  So, I was happy to say I had another female friend.</p>

		<p>Actually, Seven became very dear to me, probably more so than a lot of the crew realizes.  We have almost the same kind of relationship that I have with my sister Phoebe.  For example, I can confide anything to her, and if I simply ask her to keep it just between us, she never whispers a word of it anywhere.  I know she trusts me the same way.  She has often come to me with questions, thoughts, feelings... and then as she leaves she tell me she appreciates the privacy I give her.  Her odd little way of telling me that everything was in confidence.</p>

		<p>It has occurred to me many times in the last couple of years that I do not give her the privacy she deserves.  As a captain I have failed here.  I should have gotten her out of the cargo bay a long time ago.  I should have organized an Engineering crew to find a way to move an alcove for her into private quarters.  I thought about it more than once, but then something would happen and either we would be involved in fighting for our lives or rebuilding the ship, and I would simply forget again.  Plus, Seven just never asked.</p>

		<p>Of course, it really sank home again just how open her environment was as I watched her flee the holodeck tonight.  Before I implored my command crew to distract the crew, I had quietly ordered the computer to seal the cargo bay from everyone but Seven for the night.  It was the least I could do.  How many times had she been hurting before and she had nowhere to deal with her feelings privately?  I don't know, but now I am ashamed that I've never rectified it.</p>

		<p>Finally, I leave the holodeck, but instead of heading back to my quarters I head to Cargo Bay 2.  I just need to make sure she is okay, though I'm sure she's not.  Of course I don't really know what I am going to do once I get in to see her... if she lets me in.  Yet, I got the pips by knowing how to wing it when necessary.  I just hate applying it to situations where my friends' emotions are involved.</p>

		<p>I stand in front of the bay doors and realize, probably for the first time, there isn't an admittance chime, only a lock. Sighing, I open a comm. channel.  "Janeway to Seven of Nine.  Seven?  Can I come in?"  Yes, I am actually asking for once.  Suddenly, I feel very bad for every time that I haven't.</p>

		<p>"Captain?" Seven's even tones come back questioning me.</p>

		<p>"I... well, I sealed the bay to everyone but you earlier.  I was hoping you wouldn't mind me visiting for a minute, and I didn't want to break in with command codes."  I try to be light as if this is something we always deal with together.</p>

		<p>Abruptly, the doors open in front of me.  She is standing there in her old silver biosuit, which is not a good sign.  Her head is cocked as if she was studying me, with her eyebrow up at that damned angle she gets when she doesn't agree or cannot believe something.</p>

		<p>"Why?" she asks in a monotone and I have no idea which why she is asking about.</p>

		<p>"May I come in?" I ask her, deflecting the question until we have some privacy.</p>

		<p>"Of course," she replies and steps aside.</p>

		<p>I am stunned momentarily by the amount of destruction in the bay.  It looks like there was a rapid decompression in here, but I know it was Seven's doing.  At times, I think we all forget just how strong her 'enhancements' make her...  I know I do.  Nevertheless, it does not take her long to find a way to remind me.  Like tossing a cargo container that usually needs a lift for one of my stronger men to carry... across the bay... breaking it.  I shake my head and turn back to her.</p>

		<p>"I see you've been redecorating," I say lifting my own eyebrow and grinning at her.</p>

		<p>She blushes and turns her face away.  "I'm sorry Captain.  I shall clean it," she answers and then turns to do just that.</p>

		<p>Quickly, I put a hand around her wrist, simply to halt her.  "I was just kidding.  Well, you will need to tidy up, but I'll give you a couple of days.  It's not something that you have to do now." I sighed because I was messing this up.  Sometimes, it is hard to be both the Captain and just a person.  The Captain was always interjecting at bad times.  "Honestly Annika, I came to see you.  Your dance with B'Elanna was... unexpected.  So was your quick exit.  I think I know you well enough to say you looked hurt."</p>

		<p>She seems to deflate entirely.  It starts with a simple sagging of her shoulders.  Then, as I watch her from behind, I am surprised as her back bows also.  I'm not sure but it looks like she's crying.  I am taken off guard as she literally falls to her knees and burying her face in her hands.  I am on the floor, holding her in the next moment.</p>

		<p>Now I have seen her cry before, but usually it's simply a tear or two escaping her iron control.  I've only seen her break down like this one other time: shortly after I had severed her.  She was in the brig, shouting at me, telling me she would betray Voyager.  Her arguments had no outward affect on me and I believe that her nascent emotional control could not handle all the anger and fear.  It ended with both of us on the deck; I held her as she cried softly that night.</p>

		<p>This is not like that, even though I am on the deck holding her.  She is sobbing loudly, with full-bodied moans of pain.  She has broken down completely, though occasionally I hear a choked out word or two.  Well, really only two words:  "Why" and "B'Elanna."  I hold her through it, waiting for her to calm.</p>

		<p>"Do you want to talk about it?" I ask her when she finally seems somewhat composed.</p>

		<p>"Can you tell me why?" she actually implores me.</p>

		<p>"Why what?" I respond.</p>

		<p>"Why B'Elanna Torres? Why do I love B'Elanna?" she asks with a painful innocence, her very eyes imploring me to fix it all.  As if love is a condition anyone understands.  No wonder Vulcans find it a messy.  It is incomprehensible, illogical and plain old crazy at times.</p>

		<p>"I don't know.  I do know that we cannot choose our heart's desires."  I tell her gently.  She turns away from me again, but lays her head on my shoulder.</p>

		<p>"It is illogical," she tells me seriously.  She is staring across the bay and I wonder what it is she is seeing.  I'm sure it isn't the mound of biomaterial released from its container that has her rapt attention.</p>

		<p>"You want to tell me how this all started?" I invite gently after a few minutes have passed.  She actually sighs first and then proceeds to tell me the whole thing.</p>

		<p>The story started a while back.  I am a little bit irritated at first to hear of B'Elanna's derision of Seven, as well as Seven's cavalier attitude towards her upgrades.  It's really amazing that they have not killed each other yet.  Frankly, I don't know if there's anyone else onboard capable of killing these two without weapons.</p>

		<p>It might have been an amusing story if it had not ended so painfully.  I mean, I had wondered why Seven was suddenly wearing a uniform and following all regulations a long time ago.  When I had asked her why back then she had simply replied it was a project.  I didn't have time to pursue it then, and just as suddenly she was back to normal so I let it go.  Some of her projects continue to baffle me to this day.  I can't always wrap my mind around her thought patterns, so I sometimes leave things alone just for my own sanity.</p>

		<p>It might have been funny to know she had pulled it off; that B'Elanna's rash words and bets finally met up with Borg resistance.  I wouldn't have minded teasing B'Elanna over this actually.  Simply because I had told her many times that her bets would get her in hot water one day.</p>

		<p>It might have been funny had this been just a bit different, but it wasn't the least bit funny now.</p>

		<p>"I did not expect this Kathryn," she says after we had been silent for a while.</p>

		<p>"You never do my friend.  You never do."  I answer. Gradually, I too find myself staring unseeingly at a pile of wilting greens.  I think I see a bit of what she is seeing and I fear for Annika in this first love.  I fear for B'Elanna, the jaded young woman that she can be at times.  I even feel a little fear for my ship.  Yet, there is little I can do.</p>

		<p><b>Scene 2: ...confusion to he who cares.</b></p>

		<p>I don't know if what I am doing is a good idea but it's not the first time I've taken a risk to help one of my friends.  I knew it was useless to try to talk to B'Elanna last night when things were so raw, but I did want to help her.  Of course I had a really hard time telling Tom to just go back to his quarters and leave her alone.  He always wants to go save B'Elanna.  I don't think he ever figured out that she doesn't want his rescue.</p>

		<p>So I went to bed troubled, wondering how to help her out... without losing any body parts.  I came up with this idea shortly before I fell asleep, so here I am, standing outside of her quarters waiting for her to exit.  I decided to corner her this morning and try to gauge what's going on... help her if I can.</p>

		<p>I hear the door opening up beside me and realize I have committed myself for sure now.</p>

		<p>Oh boy.</p>

		<p>"Hey Maquis" I call out... after I clear my throat and say a prayer.  B'Elanna turns and looks at me... her face is blank.  Oh boy.</p>

		<p>"Harry," she says slowly.  "What're you doing here?"</p>

		<p>"Uh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to catch breakfast together," I answer and realize that it sounds lame even to me.</p>

		<p>"We usually meet in the mess hall.  So what gives?"  She starts walking away before I can answer, so I jog to catch up.  Before I know it we're in the turbolift, heading to the mess hall.</p>

		<p>"I just wanted to, you know, check on you.  You seemed kinda' upset when you left the ball last night," I ventured.  I was this brave because we were in a turbolift alone... or was this stupid?</p>

		<p>"Look Harry, the Ice Princess just pissed me off again.  What's new?  I go about my life and hope she stays out of my engine room for a while.  Eventually she doesn't, we fight, she pisses me off, and the cycle starts all over again.  I don't see anything to discuss," she answers with a scowl.  Then the lift doors open and she's off like a rocket.  Once again I'm jogging to catch up.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I don't think this was your normal fight," I say quietly as we gather a couple of plates and head off to the table we normally sit at if we bump into each other.  She actually gives me that little warning look... the one Tom never notices and always dashes by haplessly.</p>

		<p>"Look," she says firmly... as her tray hits the table a little too hard.  "I really don't want to talk about Seven.  We had a stupid bet.  I lost.  I had to dance with her.  End of story... okay Harry?"</p>

		<p>"All right, B'Elanna," I answer.  I know I am getting nowhere, but I can say I tried.</p>

		<p>Just then, I watch as the doors to the messhall open and Seven walks in.  She takes two large steps in then freezes, staring at B'Elanna's back.  Her face shows confusion and pain.  B'Elanna must have wondered what I was looking at... or sensed that she was being stared at, I'll never know which... because she turns around and looks at the blonde frozen just inside the door.</p>

		<p>The two stare at each other, for just a few moments, but the undercurrents are palpable.  I don't know if I'm going to have to stop a fight, or if we will all see some sort of repeat of last night... or what.  Then, I hear a soft growl coming from B'Elanna.  I know I have heard about Seven's enhanced hearing from the woman herself a bunch of times, but I suppose I never really thought about how enhanced it might be.  But it was clear that when Seven could hear B'Elanna growling, even though it's so very quiet that I can barely hear it myself.  B'Elanna must be ready for a fight, but Seven just turns her head, seemingly sad, facing the floor.  It's not the Seven I am used to seeing who leaves the mess hall just a moment later.</p>

		<p>This woman is expressive: facially... bodily.  Her whole demeanor communicates ache... and then she's gone.</p>

		<p>I look at B'Elanna as she finally turns back to her food.  She doesn't meet my eyes even as I continue to stare at her curiously.  It takes a minute or two before she finally looks up.</p>

		<p>"What?" she asks me tersely.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I really don't know how you can look at that woman who just left... after how you danced so closely with her last night," I begin and I pause, shaking my head.  "I don't know how you can still say she's made of ice.  All I see is a woman in pain."  I stand up grabbing my tray.  I am not really hungry anymore and my friend really won't be listening to me any time soon.</p>

		<p>"But I'm glad you are all right."  I say as I leave her.</p>

		<p>I don't turn back to look at her.  No, that would be awkward right now.  Maybe I'll regret saying that later.  I don't know.  It wasn't like me at all.  Yet, as I recycle my tray, heading out the doors and to the bridge... I can't help thinking that maybe I chose the wrong friend to help today.</p>
