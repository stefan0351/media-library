<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 42: Waiting impatiently -->

<P>Seven and B’Elanna spent their fist day as a joined couple locked away in
their quarters, but despite what most on board thought, they didn’t spent all of
their time making love. They used the time to fix up a small area in the living
room to use as a nursery. Even after they had used the rations to repair the
ready room, they had enough left over between them to replicate a crib and some
other furniture for the baby. It was a happy time for them, full of laughter, as
the two women trained as engineers found it almost impossible to put the crib
together. At one point, Seven had threatened to simply assimilate the parts
before she broke into a fit of laughter. After a few hours, the crib was
completed, and they had made love late into the night to celebrate. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The rest of the night was spent curled around each other talking and
laughing. Seven listened while B’Elanna remembered her childhood and the things
that she missed most about the Alpha Quadrant. Seven told B’Elanna what she
could remember about her own youth, but most of that part of her life was lost
to her. It was something that left Seven with a profound sense of loss, but
having B’Elanna’s loving touch helped soothe wounds the former drone had thought
would never heal. She went to sleep knowing that they would.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven shifted her weight and opened her eyes. She was having Braxton Hicks
contractions, false labor pains. She had already been to sickbay twice for the
annoying prelabor spasms and Opaca had explained that they were a normal part of
the birthing process and that the best thing to do was to get a massage or take
a hot shower. Seven didn’t want to wake B’Elanna to rub her back because the
Klingon would have insisted that they go to sickbay, just like she had the first
two times. She smiled as she looked down at B’Elanna. </P>
<P>The Klingon was sound asleep, flat on her back, content to spend the night
acting as Seven’s personal body pillow. With the pregnancy advancing, Seven
found it almost impossible to find a comfortable sleeping position. Using her
wife as pillow helped her sleep through the night. </P>
<P>She leaned onto one elbow and studied B’Elanna. Her head was turned toward
Seven, her mouth was relaxed, and Seven had a perfect view of the tiny mole on
her cheek. It was a small speck, but any time see looked at B’Elanna, she
noticed it. It was one of her favorite things about her wife’s appearance. Seven
loved watching her sleep. It was a time she could stare openly at her beautiful
wife without B’Elanna getting embarrassed. When Seven tried to study her
features while B’Elanna was awake, the Klingon would look away. Years of being
criticized for her appearance had left B’Elanna self-conscious. Seven wished
B’Elanna could see herself like she did, beautiful, elegant, and the
personification of perfection.</P>
<P>Seven climbed out of the bed, instantly missing the warmth of B’Elanna’s
body, but she needed to stretch. Her back was aching and she didn’t want to wake
her wife. She felt another twinge, and sighed. She hated taking a shower alone.
It was so much more enjoyable when B’Elanna joined her. </P>
<P>She climbed into the shower and let the water soothe her aching back. As she
bent her head forward, she saw her necklace and smiled, then picked it up and
studied it. The main medallion was round, with two circles interconnected. The
circle was the Narian symbol for the goddess as well as the representation of
the romantic heart. She turned it over and smiled at the smaller medallion. It
was a perfect triangle, representing her, B’Elanna, and their daughter. It had
the same two interwoven circles but there was a smaller circle inside them. She
hissed as one of the contractions made her twist her back. It was just like
humans to come up with such a useless process. True, the Braxton Hicks
contractions helped to prepare her uterus for the actual birth, but it was
annoying to have so many "dry runs" as Opaca called them.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna opened her eyes, sensing that something wasn’t right. She looked at
the crumpled sheets where her wife should have been and sighed. She assumed she
was in the bathroom, then noticed a small red spot on the sheets.</P>
<P>"Seven?" she called out. She climbed out of bed in a daze and headed toward
the bathroom and opened the door. Steamed rolled out of the room, tumbling in
slow motion. B’Elanna froze in the doorway as she saw her wife sprawled on the
floor next to the shower. Seven’s eyes were open but vacant, and her face was
the color of death. The entire floor was covered in red-black blood.</P>
<P>"No!" B’Elanna screamed as she sat up in bed. She grabbed her chest,
clutching to her bonding necklace as she realized that she had been dreaming.
She looked over at the empty bed beside her and almost panicked. "It was a
dream," she whispered to herself as she headed toward the bathroom. "Stupid
Klingon," she said under her breath before she opened the door. "Seven?" she
called out over the noise of the shower.</P>
<P>There was a pause and then the shower door opened and Seven leaned out.
"Be’nal, why are you up? It is not even 08:00."</P>
<P>"Then what are you doing up?" B’Elanna asked as she climbed into the shower
and hugged her wife. "Umm, you feel good," she said over the pounding water.</P>
<P>"As do you." Seven turned to face her wife. She cringed and squinted her
eyes.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna moved her hand to Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"Nothing," Seven assured her. "It is just another Braxton Hicks
contraction."</P>
<P>"You’re having contractions? Come on, we’re going to sickbay," B’Elanna said
as she shut off the water.</P>
<P>"But… They are stopping…and I wasn’t finished with my shower," Seven
whined.</P>
<P>"Too bad," B’Elanna said, rubbing a large white towel over Seven’s back.
"That’s what you get for not waking me."</P>
<P>B’Elanna escorted Seven to the sickbay, studying her every move during the
turbolift ride. Seven was not amused.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I am fine. There was no reason for us to come to sickbay this
early." Seven had her arms crossed defiantly and she was pouting. Her lower lip
was sticking out and she looked like she had just been sent to her room without
supper.</P>
<P>"You are having contractions." B’Elanna moved closer to her wife and rested
her hand on Seven’s shoulder. "I will not risk anything happening. You aren’t
due for another month. What if you’re having another temporal spike?"</P>
<P>"It isn’t like that," Seven said as she wrapped her arms around B’Elanna’s
shoulders. "Do not worry. This is just like the other false labor pains."</P>
<P>"But what if it isn’t?" B’Elanna sighed and rested her forehead on Seven’s
chest. "I don’t want you or the baby hurt," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said when the lift stopped. "But the next time I tell you
it is nothing, you had better believe me."</P>
<P>"There better not be a next time," B’Elanna said as she led Seven toward the
sickbay. They entered and B’Elanna looked for Opaca. She had called before she
left her quarters, so the hologram was already activated and waiting next to a
biobed.</P>
<P>"Well, good morning," Opaca said as she turned to face them. "Seven, how are
you?"</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven insisted. "Please inform B’Elanna that I am capable of
determining whether or not I am in labor."</P>
<P>Opaca helped Seven onto the biobed. "Actually, the Braxton Hicks contractions
feel identical to real labor contractions, so you can only tell once they’ve
stopped or I’ve confirmed it with a tricorder." Opaca scanned Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"See," B’Elanna said. "I told you we should come down here."</P>
<P>"Well?" Seven asked Opaca.</P>
<P>"You’re fine, Seven. False labor, go home and take a hot shower and get some
rest," Opaca said. She turned toward B’Elanna and pulled her aside as Seven
began climbing off of the biobed. "B’Elanna, are you having nightmares again?
You look awfully worried," she asked quietly.</P>
<P>"Yeah," she said in a whisper. She was embarrassed by the nightmares and the
fact that Opaca had seen through her so easily.</P>
<P>"I see," Opaca said as she scanned B’Elanna. She shook her head and smiled.
"Hold still, I almost forgot something." She went and took a hypospray out of a
medical cabinet.</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna asked as she went back to her. "What would it hurt if you
came down each morning and let Opaca check you? Just to be sure?"</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven insisted. "I do not like it here," she added and then let
her eyes drift toward the office where the Doctor was trying to look busy.</P>
<P>Opaca returned and stopped in front of B’Elanna. "Actually, after that last
scan of you, B’Elanna…I think <I>you</I> need to stop by each morning." She
injected B’Elanna’s throat with the hypospray. </P>
<P>B’Elanna flinched and stepped back. "Hey! She’s the one who was having
symptoms." B’Elanna stared at Opaca incredulously.</P>
<P>"What is wrong with her?" Seven demanded as she wrapped her arm around
B’Elanna’s waist.</P>
<P>"It’s about time for B’Elanna to start getting ready for the baby," Opaca
explained. "I just started her hormone series. She’ll need an injection each
morning to get her body ready to nurse when the baby arrives."</P>
<P>"You scared me," Seven accused.</P>
<P>"Yeah?" Opaca stood toe to toe with the much taller former drone. "And what
exactly would you do to get rid of that fear?"</P>
<P>"Anything," Seven said menacingly.</P>
<P>"So, I guess you won’t mind letting me check you once a day to get rid of
your wife’s fear?" Opaca smiled and crossed her arms. She knew she had Seven
cornered.</P>
<P>"That would be acceptable," Seven said. She looked at B’Elanna. "I did not
mean to worry you."</P>
<P>"I know, love. Now, let’s go home." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and kissed her
knuckles.</P>
<P>"Oh, B’Elanna," Opaca called out. "You might notice a little tenderness in
your breasts but it’s nothing to worry about."</P>
<P>"Thanks, I think," B’Elanna said as the doors hissed shut behind them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The next three weeks passed quickly, and with each day B’Elanna and Seven
became more excited. B’Elanna also became more hormonal, caught in the throws of
the daily injections. Seven grew more frustrated as her belly continued to
expand. She swore it was so huge that it would leave warp four point two seconds
before she did.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>As time passed, Seven made certain to include Naomi whenever possible. With
Ty on board and a baby on the way, the former only-child was feeling worried
that she would be replaced in Seven’s heart. Seven and B’Elanna had her spend
the night occasionally, just the three of them. Naomi and B’Elanna had bonded
during these slumber parties and Seven looked forward to the day when their
daughter would be old enough to join them.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The last week before the baby was due, B'Elanna and Seven began their
maternity leave. On the first day of their leave, Seven and B’Elanna went for
breakfast in the mess hall and then spent the afternoon with Naomi and Ty in the
holodeck while Nara and Tach helped the captain go over the star charts. It was
a busy afternoon that left Seven more than a little tired and when they dropped
off the two children, the former Borg was in need of a nap. Surprisingly,
B’Elanna seemed eager for a midday rest as well. Since both women had the day
off, they decided to take advantage of it.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven awoke alone, but that wasn’t unusual. Often, when B’Elanna would join
her for a nap, she would often be well rested after only an hour or two. Seven
needed extra sleep with the pregnancy progressing. Even with an extra hour of
regeneration each morning, Seven seemed to get tired and cranky when she had
been up for several hours. A nap seemed like the best solution. </P>
<P>Seven climbed out of the bed and headed toward the bathroom and the sound of
the pounding water. She smiled, thinking that perhaps she could join her wife
for more than just a shower. They had found the most wonderful uses for the
small shower stall that had nothing to do with getting clean.</P>
<P>As she opened the door, Seven heard a loud moan coming from the shower and
went to investigate. "Lana?" she called out as she opened the shower door. The
Klingon was facing the wall, her forehead resting against the cool tile with the
water beating down on her back.</P>
<P>"I’m going to kill Opaca," B’Elanna said and then moaned even louder. "I
swear to Kahless… I’m going to delete her matrix."</P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven asked, concern making her throat constrict. She stepped
into the water and massaged her wife’s tense shoulders.</P>
<P>"I think I’m dying," B’Elanna whined, still resting her head on the tile.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven squeezed B’Elanna’s shoulders. "Should we call sickbay?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna whined as she turned around. She looked down at her chest. Her
breasts were swelling even more than they had in the past. The artificial
hormones had kicked in, and after three weeks, her mammary glands were working
overtime. "I think my breasts are going to explode," the Klingon warrior
whined.</P>
<P>Seven smirked, relief flooding her features. "Opaca did say there would be
some discomfort." Seven gently examined her wife’s breasts. "I thought you were
having a negative reaction to the injections, but I believe this is normal."</P>
<P>"Ouch." B’Elanna pulled back as Seven tried to lift one breast. "I think this
is a pretty negative reaction." She pointed toward her tender breasts. "This is
before I even have milk. Just how big are these things gonna’ get?"</P>
<P>"You will adapt," Seven said with a smile. She took B’Elanna’s hand, kissed
her knuckles, and then placed the Klingon’s hand on her belly. The baby kicked
and B’Elanna sighed.</P>
<P>"Okay, so I’m being a baby," B’Elanna said as she turned off the water. "But
it hurts," she whined.</P>
<P>Seven guided B’Elanna out of the shower and began drying her with a large
towel from the counter. "Your hormones are undergoing changes as well. It will
make you more irritable," Seven explained gently.</P>
<P>"<I>More</I> irritable? What does that mean?" B’Elanna asked angrily. She
turned and faced her wife and put her hands on her hips defiantly. "Do you think
that I’m irritable?"</P>
<P>Seven stood there not knowing what to say. She suddenly had a great deal of
respect for B’Elanna’s patience. Seven had gone through months of these mood
swings and B’Elanna had seemed able to adapt with ease, always finding the right
thing to say or do.</P>
<P>"You do, don’t you?" B’Elanna asked again. "You think I’m irritable!" Her
eyes shined and her lip trembled and the strong, brave warrior burst into tears
and ran out of the bathroom.</P>
<P>Seven decided that perhaps she should kill Opaca. She heard her wife’s
muffled cries from the other room and quietly went to find her. Seven was still
wet from the shower, and left a trail of water across the carpet.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven asked from the side of the bed. "I did not mean to imply that
you are irritable." She sat next to her wife, trying to remember what B’Elanna
had said to her when she had been hormonal. "Be’nal?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna sniffled. She was on her side, unable to rest on her stomach because
of her aching breasts. "You don’t think I’m irritable?" B’Elanna wiped her eyes
with the sheet.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she rubbed B’Elanna’s back. "You put up with my mood
swings all these months. Could an irritable person do that?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna agreed and sat up. "Oh god," B’Elanna said as she turned to
Seven and scooted over to her. She rested her head on Seven’s shoulder and
hugged her. "What are we gonna’ do if you and I are both hormonal at the same
time, my Be’nal?"</P>
<P>Seven shuddered at that thought. "I hope we never have to find out," she said
sincerely. B’Elanna chuckled and squeezed her a bit closer.</P>
<P>"Well, at least my breasts are getting bigger," B’Elanna said when she
finally eased back.</P>
<P>"I love your breasts exactly how they are. Why would you want them any
bigger?" Seven asked. She couldn’t understand why B’Elanna would want to change
a single thing about her compact body. Every single millimeter was perfection,
perfectly proportional, toned, and incredibly sexy. B’Elanna’s breasts seemed
divinely designed, perfect mounds of tender yet responsive flesh that fit
perfectly in Seven’s hands, and of course her nipples seem tailor made to fill
Seven’s mouth. She wouldn’t change them even if she could.</P>
<P>"Well," B’Elanna said as she stared openly at Seven’s much fuller cleavage.
"Mine are kinda’… small compared to yours."</P>
<P>"Yours are perfect." Seven reached up and cupped B’Elanna’s chin in her
fingers. "We fit perfectly together. Our differences make us the perfect match."
She leaned over and playfully kissed B’Elanna’s nose. "And they filled my hands.
Any more would be wasteful." Seven covered both of B’Elanna’s breasts with her
hands.</P>
<P>B’Elanna inhaled sharply and closed her eyes. "Well, right now, they’re
pretty sore." She tried to relax into her wife’s touch.</P>
<P>"Am I hurting you?" Seven asked as she pulled away.</P>
<P>"Don’t go," B’Elanna whispered. She brought her own hands up to hold Seven’s
soothing touch in place. "Your hands feel nice. I don’t want you to move."</P>
<P>"Then I shall not." Seven cradled the tender mounds in her hands with
incredible care. She leaned forward and kissed B’Elanna’s forehead. "I shall
hold you as long as you need me…although I think it may cause a scene if I have
to accompany you to Engineering or the bridge."</P>
<P>"I’d like to see that," B’Elanna said. She smiled as Seven continued to place
feather-light kisses on the ridges of her forehead.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you should rest some more?" Seven suggested. She eased B’Elanna
toward the bed.</P>
<P>"You’re soaking wet," B’Elanna pointed out. Seven stretched out beside her,
ignoring the water.</P>
<P>Seven shifted her weight until she settled her belly into comfortable
position. "I believe that I have spent many nights in this bed…soaking wet," she
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Very funny." B’Elanna turned over and then scooted her back up against
Seven’s chest. It was a difficult position to pull off with Seven’s huge stomach
in the way, but they managed. Seven brought her hand around in front of B’Elanna
and cradled one breast with infinite tenderness.</P>
<P>"Get some sleep," Seven whispered into B’Elanna’s hair.</P>
<P>"You feel good." B’Elanna covered Seven’s hand with her fingers, not wanting
to her pull away. She yawned. "I love you, Seven," she said as her eyes drifted
shut.</P>
<P>"I love you, my wife," Seven whispered. She snuggled against her and then
joined her beloved in a restful sleep.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven awoke a short while later and watched B’Elanna sleep. The Klingon had
rolled onto her back and her mouth was open, a hint of drool was threatening to
fall from her lips, and her hair was matted to the side of her face. Seven
thought she was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen. She smiled,
content to just watch for the moment, and then B’Elanna’s eyes opened.</P>
<P>"Do you watch me sleep often?" B’Elanna asked as she rolled onto her
side.</P>
<P>Seven blushed.</P>
<P>"I watch you too," B’Elanna admitted. She reached out and tucked a stray
strand of hair behind Seven’s ear. "You look so relaxed when you sleep."
B’Elanna smiled and traced her wife’s lips with her fingers. "Sometimes when
you’re really tired, you stick just the tip of your tongue out. It’s always
right in the middle."</P>
<P>Seven frowned, not liking the sound of that and then nipped her wife’s
fingers.</P>
<P>"It’s adorable," B’Elanna assured her.</P>
<P>"Do you still hurt?" Seven reached out and rubbed B’Elanna’s chest.</P>
<P>"Not as much. Sorry I was so emotional earlier." She lifted Seven’s hand and
kissed her palm. "You were really great."</P>
<P>"I love you," Seven said as if that explained everything, and perhaps it
did.</P>
<P>"Shall we get up?" B’Elanna asked. "Maybe have a late lunch?"</P>
<P>"More like an early dinner," Seven said as she checked the clock. "I’ll cook.
You rest on the couch."</P>
<P>"That sounds nice." B’Elanna stood and came around the bed and helped Seven
sit up, then pulled her to her feet. "You sure you feel up it?"</P>
<P>"I am used to these hormones," Seven pointed out as she found a loose fitting
dress to put on. She dug through the closet until she found another loose dress
and handed it to B’Elanna. "Put this on," she ordered.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so." B’Elanna scrunched up her face at the plain blue
sundress. </P>
<P>"Anything tight on your breasts will be uncomfortable." Seven tilted her head
to one side as B’Elanna shook her head and continued scrunching her face. "Are
you sure?" Seven asked skeptically.</P>
<P>"Yep," B’Elanna said. She went to her dresser and retrieved a pair of
sweatpants and an oversized tee shirt. "See? Nice and loose," she said after she
lowered the shirt over her head. "Now, where’s my dinner, woman?" she asked
playfully.</P>
<P>"Go wait on the couch. I will prepare it, wife." Seven swatted B’Elanna on
the behind.</P>
<P>Ten minutes later B’Elanna was stretched out on the couch feeling quite
spoiled. Her pregnant wife had almost finished replicating her something that
smelled wonderful, she had a cold glass of apple cider in her hand and her feet
were perched on the arm of the couch.</P>
<P>The door chime sounded and B’Elanna started to stand.</P>
<P>"Stay," Seven ordered as she came out of the small kitchenette. She opened
the door and was surprised to see Ty standing in the corridor alone…alone and
completely naked with his face and chest covered in chocolate.</P>
<P>"Evan!" He beamed happily, holding out his chocolate covered hands.</P>
<P>"Tyralanar, where are your parents?" Seven asked as she knelt next to him.
"And where are your clothes?" She picked up the naked bundle and settled him
onto her hip as she looked up and down the empty corridor.</P>
<P>"Ty?" B’Elanna sat up and stared at the messy bundle in her wife’s arms.</P>
<P>"Ba! My Ba!" He squirmed until Seven put him down and then he sprinted to the
Klingon.</P>
<P>"This is most unusual." Seven went to the closet to retrieve some clothing
for Ty. She and B’Elanna kept some of his outfits in their closet because they
kept him on many nights when they didn’t have duty the next day. It gave his
parents a chance to be alone and she and B’Elanna loved having him. "How did he
get here?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Isn’t it your nap time?" B’Elanna asked. She lifted him onto her lap. "And
what happened to your clothes, little tiger?"</P>
<P>"Clothes off," he informed her and grabbed for her cider. She helped him take
a gulp and then put the glass back on the coffee table.</P>
<P>"That much I can see for myself," B’Elanna told him. "Where are you
parents?"</P>
<P>"Ty fix the door," he said proudly.</P>
<P>"I think we need to check the security locks on our door as well," B’Elanna
said. "If he figured out theirs, he’ll figure out ours." B’Elanna looked up at
Seven who had brought the clothes over along with a wet washcloth.</P>
<P>"Evan’s baby." Ty pointed to her belly.</P>
<P>"And Ba’s baby too," Seven said as she picked him up.</P>
<P>"I should call Tach and let him know the little rascal is here." B’Elanna
stood. She looked at Seven trying to wash Ty’s face. He was making a game of
avoiding the washcloth. "Seven, I think you might as well just give him a bath."
She shook her head and smiled. Ty avoided the cloth like a Da’har master
avoiding a bat’tleth strike.</P>
<P>"Bath!" Ty yelled and bounced on Seven’s hip.</P>
<P>"Perhaps that would be best." Seven looked down at her chocolate covered
dress. She carried him into the bathroom while B’Elanna went to the nearest
console.</P>
<P>B’Elanna tapped the console. "Torres to Tach," she said as she waited for the
image to appear on screen. She waited another moment, listening to the water
filling the tub in the bathroom. Ty was squealing, obviously having a wonderful
time after his naked adventure through the corridor. Tach had made arrangements
to swap Quarters with Ensign Miller and Enzati who had shared a room on one side
of B’Elanna’s quarters. The Narians wanted to be close B’Elanna and Seven. The
two ensigns had jumped at the chance because it meant they would get to share a
larger doubles quarters in the VIP area. <I>Voyager</I> was running out of
places to put its growing crew.</P>
<P>"Tyralanar, this water is to clean you, not to be used as a projectile,"
Seven said over the sound of the filling tub.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and tapped the console. "Torres to Tach," she said
again.</P><I>
<P>*"What?"*</I> Tach said over the console. There was no image because the
privacy code was in place.</P>
<P>"Tach," B’Elanna asked sweetly. "What are you doing?"</P><I>
<P>*"I was in the shower,"*</I> he said impatiently.</P>
<P>"And what is Nara doing?" B’Elanna asked with an evil grin.</P><I>
<P>*"She was in the shower with me,"*</I> he said pointedly. Obviously they had
been doing more than getting clean.</P>
<P>"And what is Ty doing?" B’Elanna asked sweetly, pushing her luck.</P><I>
<P>*"He’s taking a nap,"*</I> Tach said. He was breathing heavily.
<I>*"Why?"*</P></I>
<P>"I don’t think he is," B’Elanna said as her smile widened. "I think he’s
enjoying his own naked time."</P><I>
<P>*"What are you talking about?"*</I> His voice drifted off as he walked away
from the console in his quarters. <I>*"Tyralanar!"*</I> he yelled. B’Elanna
heard his footsteps as he jogged back to the console. <I>*"He’s gone. Ty’s gone.
Do you know where he is?"*</P></I>
<P>"Well, right now, my wife is giving him a bath," B’Elanna said.</P><I>
<P>*"I’ll be right there,"*</I> he said and then the console channel closed.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and went to the bathroom door and looked in on Ty. He was in
heaven, and who could blame him. He had a gorgeous blonde Borg tending to his
every need. Seven was kneeling next to the tub handing him each toy as he would
launch it across the small room. It was his version of fetch, with Seven filling
the role of the pet targh.</P>
<P>"I spoke with Tach," B’Elanna said as she watched her wife with Ty. She
smiled, feeling her heart fill until it threatened to burst. She imagined Seven
with their daughter and it was almost too much. "He’s on his way over."</P>
<P>"Fa?" Ty looked up from drowning a rubber ducky. Harry Kim had given it him.
Nara thought it was the ugliest thing she had every seen, so Seven offered to
keep it for Ty. It was one of his favorite bath toys.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said. "Your Fa is on his way over and he didn’t sound very
happy."</P>
<P>"Ty fix Fa’s door," he informed her once again.</P>
<P>"I’ll just bet you did," B’Elanna said. She wondered how many repair teams it
would take to "unfix" the door. "I think Ty’s little adventure interrupted
something," she added with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Lana…" Seven rinsed Ty’s hair. "Why don’t we keep him? Let them have some
alone time without worrying about Ty <I>fixing</I> anything else?"</P>
<P>"Sure," B’Elanna said as the door chime sounded. She went to the door and
opened it. Tach was in a robe, still dripping wet. "Well, hello Fas’fa," she
said with a laugh. Tach’s hair was dripping shampoo down one side and he didn’t
look pleased. "How’s my big brother?" B’Elanna asked with a wicked smile.</P>
<P>"I am about to spank your nephew," Tach said as he came into her quarters.
"He dismantled the replicator <I>again</I>, and managed to open the door locking
mechanism. All in less than ten minutes while we were in the shower."</P>
<P>"Go back home and relax. Seven and I will keep him for the night." B’Elanna
pushed him back out the door.</P>
<P>"Are you sure?" he asked. </P>
<P>"Yes, now go home and have a nice night with your wife." B’Elanna sighed and
shook her head. "If he’s doing this much damage and he’s not even a year and a
half old…just think what he’s gonna’ be doing in another year or two."</P>
<P>"Great goddess above and below," he said. "I’m never going to survive
this."</P>
<P>"Poor thing." B’Elanna laughed. </P>
<P>"Just wait, that child of yours will be even worse," Tach said, pausing in
the corridor.</P>
<P>"Not a chance," B’Elanna said. "With Seven and I as her mothers, she’s going
to be a perfect little angel who won’t even know how to get into trouble. I
guarantee it."</P>
<P>Tach burst out laughing as he walked away and continued howling with laughter
even as he went into his quarters.</P>
<P>"It wasn’t <I>that</I> funny," B’Elanna said as she stared down the empty
corridor.</P>
