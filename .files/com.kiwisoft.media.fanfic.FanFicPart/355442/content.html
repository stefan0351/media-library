<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part Four -->

<p>Sam was in the bathroom, cleaning the mascara off her cheeks when she heard a soft, almost hesitant knock on her bedroom door.</p>
<p>"Go away!" She yelled, not wanting to even look at Brooke at this moment.</p>
<p>"I am aware that I?m probably the last person you?d want to see right now." Came Brooke?s voice from the other side of the door. "However, I thought that you would like to have your diary back. You left it in the kitchen." Sam quickly walked to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>"You didn?t read it, did you?" She asked with a small glimpse of worry dancing in her chocolate eyes.</p>
<p>"No." Brooke replied. "I admit that the idea crossed my mind, but I decided that I have been enough of a bitch for today." Sam looked at the blonde girl, barely believing her own ears. Brooke McQueen, her life-long enemy, had just received an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn all of her deepest darkest secrets, and she didn?t take it?</p>
<p>"Um...thanks, I guess." Sam said as she took the book from Brooke?s hands.</p>
<p>"No problem. " Brooke said, a nervous smile at her lips. "Listen Sam, " she began, "I really am sorry for what I said a while ago, and I would like to...you know...make it up to you. If I can."</p>
<p>Sam looked at her diary, thinking about what the blonde had just said while running her fingertips over the smooth cover. "Eh, well, what did you have in mind?" She asked after a few moments of silence.</p>
<p>"I was thinking about making dinner for us. Dad and Jane are going to be away until late tonight anyway." Brooke said, finding a sudden interest in a ring on her left hand.</p>
<p>Sam thought for a sec. Dinner? Ok, she could do dinner. "Sure." She said, still not looking at Brooke. "That would be ok I assume."</p>
<p>"Great." Brooke lifted her head. "Um, I?ll come back up here and get you once it?s ready."</p>
<p>As Brooke again went downstairs, Sam observed her retreating figure until it disappeared from sight. The high and mighty Queen bee of Kennedy High cooking? ?This should be interesting.? She thought before once again closing her door.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>A few hours later, Brooke was all done in the kitchen. Looking over the room once more to make sure that everything was tidy, she decided it was time to go get Sam. Walking up the steps to the upper floor, the cheerleader heard soft music coming from Sam?s room. She waited outside the door for a while, recognizing the tones from the latest single from The Corrs, "Would You Be Happier". Still, it sounded different from the version she remembered having heard on the radio a number of times.</p>
<p>Brooke quietly opened the door and peeked inside. Sam was sitting at her desk with her left side to the door, not noticing the fact that it had opened. A large number of felt-tip pens in every imaginable color were scattered all over the table. The brunette was leaning over a piece of paper on the desk, obviously very concentrated on coloring it. Brooke smiled as she saw Sam?s tongue sticking out in her cheek once again.</p>
<p>As Sam leaned back in her chair and held the paper in front of her, the blonde?s eyes widened considerably. From the look on the brunette?s face, Brooke could tell that she was studying it critically. The cheerleader didn?t understand why, that drawing was absolutely beautiful! Getting a closer look at the paper, Brooke had to admit that Sam had impeccable taste when it came to colors and how to combine them. The drawing pictured a young woman with long golden hair in what seemed to be a simple dance. She was wearing a top and a long skirt, both lovely decorated with small round objects in bright colors. Her nearest surroundings held a lovely dark blue, while the further objects, which followed the borders of the paper, were colored in four different shades of green.</p>
<p>Sam placed the paper back on the desk and leaned over it once more as she continued her work. As the next chorus played from the speakers, the cheerleader realized why the song had seemed different to her at first. Sam was singing along to it, her clear voice following every note in perfect harmony.</p>
<p><i>Would you be happier if you weren?t someone together?</i></p>
<p><i>Would sun shine brighter if you played a bigger part?</i></p>
<p><i>Would you be wonderful if it wasn?t for the weather?</i></p>
<p><i>You gonna be just fine.</i></p>
<p>Brooke couldn?t help but notice the way Sam?s lips moved as she sang. It looked so, well so professional. Her bottom lip quivered slightly in all the right places, and on each "l" sound, her tongue would automatically place itself on the front of her teeth.</p>
<p>Pulling her thoughts back to the real world, the blonde decided that it was time to make Sam aware of her presence. Knocking the door softly, Brooke watched as the brunette quickly turned her head, her long brown locks creating a slight halo-effect around her head.</p>
<p>"Hungry?" Brooke asked with a small smile.</p>
<p>"Yeah." The reply came in a very neutral tone.</p>
