<P><B>aha, and out of thin air (well, more like my mind), chapter 6 appears!</B></P><P>I stalked out of Principal Harte's room, stomping down the hall. I wasn't about to return to class, so I just wandered the halls for a good while. I remembered that Lilly had said she had to go to biology, so I headed off in that direction. When I came to the science hall, I strolled slowly by each class, looking in through a window or open door, trying to see where she was. I finally found her in Mrs. Symon's room. She had a seat towards the middle of the room. Not in the back, like a slacker like me; but not in the front, like the goody two shoes I'd pegged her as.</P><P>I still didn't get it. What was so wrong about me calling her a goody two shoes? I mean, if the two shoes fit, ya know? And she certainly does seem like a little goody goody. She does what she's told, she listens to Blondie like that woman runs the universe, she does her homework. So how could she possibly be called anything other than a goody two shoes?</P><P>I watched Lilly for a little while. She sat in her desk like the perfect little student she is and took every note that Mrs. Symon wrote on the board. She raised her hand when a question was asked. I noticed that at one point, she started daydreaming. Her gaze fell into abyss and she was somewhere else. Her pen was subconsciously being gnawed at as she held it in her mouth. Then, Melissa London, with her frizzy orange hair and her freckles and her headgear, leaned over from the desk next to Lilly's and tapped her shoulder. Lilly jumped back to reality and quickly went back to furiously taking down notes.</P><P>Melissa found my gaze and held it, staring at me with this horrible expression, like I was some horrible person. Now, I have to admit, this isn't very uncommon for people to do; but for some reason, from Melissa London, it seemed...weird...wrong. She actually looked like she really hated me...or envied me. But why in the world would she envy me?</P><P>I glanced back at Lilly, watching how graceful she was even when she was just writing notes, and became mesmerized. I studied her; how soft her skin looked, how her pouty lips looked a little ragged because, as I'd noticed recently, she chewed on them a lot, how her eyelashes looked forever long and uber thick.</P><P>Oh, shit. What was I doing? No fucking way I was just checking her out. First of all, she's missing a dick. Second of all, she's my step-sister. Third of all, I'm debating whether I can even tolerate her as a roommate, much less a friend or...</P><P>No. Nuh-uh. Nope. I am not thinking this. This is not happening. I'm just more crazy than I thought. That's the only way to explain it.</P><P>...</P><P>"Miley!" It was Lilly's voice, calling me from behind. "Wait up!"</P><P>I did what I was told-(What the fuck? Since when did that happen?)-and stopped, waiting for her to catch up.</P><P>"We should eat lunch together," she proposed. I accidentally noticed the way her hair bounced when she came to a halt in front of me and started looking at anything but her. She noticed my evasion of her face. "Or not. Look, Oliver told me what you said, but like it or not, we've kinda taken you in now. If that bugs you, sorry, but he's kind of attached to you now. He'll never say this, but it's hard for him to make friends who actually like him for him."</P><P>I finally brought my eyes back to her face and noticed what a deep shade of blue-green hers were. Damn it! "Yeah, I can see why."</P><P>She looked a little taken aback at first, like I'd just insulted her, not him, but it was quickly shaken off. "Whatever. From now on, I'm going to ignore the rude things you say, because I know you need friends just as much as we do."</P><P>"We? I thought you were just talking about Oliver."</P><P>She hesitated. "I was."</P><P>"But you just said 'we.' "</P><P>"Oh, look, there's Oliver. He's already saved us seats. Hey, Oliver!" She grasped my hand and tugged me over to the table Oliver was currently sitting at. As we came upon him, he noticed that she'd cupped her hand in mine and gawked. Lilly glanced down and ripped her hand out of mine so fast I think I got a burn from the friction.</P><P>"For the record," I said, sitting down across from Oliver and next to Lilly, "I do not need friends. I have plenty."</P><P>"Name one," Lilly challenged.</P><P>"Laine," I answered automatically.</P><P>Oliver rolled his eyes. "Too easy. Name ten."</P><P>"Fine. There's Laine, and Roger, and April, and Amanda, and-" After Amanda, I realized that I'd run out. Fuck.</P><P>"And?" Oliver prompted.</P><P>I rolled my eyes. "Well it doesn't matter. You guys don't need to know my friends anyway."</P><P>"Exactly," Lilly said, looking pleased with herself, "I'm going to get some food, wanna come?" She looked at me expectantly.</P><P>"No, you go ahead. Grab me some tater tots though."</P><P>"Will do."</P><P>Once she was out of earshot, Oliver leaned closer to me. "What was that?"</P><P>"What was what?" The confusion was evident across my features.</P><P>"You two holding hands! And earlier, when you were staring at her through the window of her class. I saw that look on your face. Did she finally tell you?"</P><P>A mix of emotions ran through me. Confusion, defensiveness, and first and foremost, denial. "Tell me what?"</P><P>Realization flooded his face. "Oh, shit." He leaned back and clamped a hand over his mouth. "Okay, don't tell her I told you."</P><P>"Told me what? What the fuck is going on?"</P><P>"Nothing! Look, just pretend everything is normal."</P><P>"Fuck, I thought everything was normal, what the hell are you talking about?"</P><P>"Shh! She's coming back!" He sat up straight (ha-ha) again and plastered on a smile to greet Lilly as she returned to the table.</P><P>"Hey, here's your tater tots," she placed them in front of me, then saw Oliver's facial expression, "What's going on?"</P><P>"Nothing!" Oliver squeaked.</P><P>"Apparently," I mumbled.</P><P>Lilly glared at him and squinted her eyes, scrutinizing his face. "What aren't you telling me?"</P><P>You could tell that he was grasping for something, anything, to say just as a filler to ward off suspicion. It was also obvious that he was coming up with nothing. So, like the heroic person that I am, I stepped in with my flawless lying skills. "I was hoping Oliver would keep it a secret, but since he's such a pansy and a horrible actor, I guess I have to tell you now."</P><P>"Tell me what?" She pronounced each word slowly, cautiously.</P><P>"I was lightly, very lightly, considering joining an...extra-curricular," I shuddered at the thought, knowing that it was what I had to do in reality, not just in a lie, to graduate now, "But then I realized it was for losers and dropped the idea."</P><P>"Oh, yes, because everyone knows that all the cool kids go smoke behind the gym after school instead of doing something productive," Lilly countered.</P><P>"How did you know we do that?" I asked, shocked.</P><P>"I didn't. I made that up. Do you really go smoke behind the gym after school?"</P><P>I evaded her penetrating gaze. But why? It's not like I've ever cared before whether people knew I'd smoked. Why did it matter that she did? "No."</P><P>"Liar."</P><P>Shit. Oh well. Add it to my list of things I shouldn't be doing but don't give a fuck that I do anyway:</P><P>1)Smoking</P><P>2)Lying</P><P>3)Failing</P><P>4)Sitting with Lilly and Oliver at lunch</P><P>I considered adding the way I've recently started to look at Lilly, but then I realized that I do give a fuck that I do that. It bugs the hell out of me because I don't know why I'm doing it. She's changing me and I don't want to be changed. And she's not even doing anything extraordinary to change me. Damn it. I'll have to try harder to be me.</P><P>"Whatever. Like I give a fuck," I retorted.</P><P>She looked at me hard, like the other day when she was dying my hair and talking about how I'm a bitch. Then she said, "I know you do." She stated them just like she'd said the other day: <I>No. You don't.</I> As if she just knew me oh, so well.</P><P>"Get a life. You don't know shit, about me or about anything else."</P><P>I stalked off from the table, not looking back to see their expressions. But for a split second, and unfamiliar emotion washed through me.</P><P>Was that...<I>remorse? Guilt? Regret?</I></P><P>Did I actually feel <I>bad, </I>because I knew that I'd probably hurt her feelings?</P><P>No...</P><P>Maybe...</P><P>Yes...</P><P>Fuck...</P><P>This is not happening. This cannot be happening to me. I am not...</P><P>No. I won't say it. Because it's not true. It can't be true. There is no way that this is true.</P><P>I took one last look behind me, at Lilly, and as soon as I saw her face, I knew it was true.</P><P>Damn it all to hell, I'm gay.</P><P><B>so maybe it's a little fast paced. i might have gotten to the whole gay thing too soon. but i think i have some ideas for later in the story that if i'm going to implement she might as well admit it now. idk, tell me what you think. ideas are always appreciated, as well as constructive criticism. so go ahead and hit that little button we all love so much. review please! :)</B></P>
