<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 6 -->

<p>In the Captain's quarter, Seven sat on the couch waiting for Katherine to
finish preparing dinner. That's what the Captain had asked Seven to call her
from now on while they were alone. Katherine stepped out of the little
kitchenette carrying two glasses of red wine. Handing one to Seven she sat down
next to her. When Seven gave her that trademark questioning raised eyebrow
Katherine knew she had to explain.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you don't drink alcohol Seven but the synthahol level in this
is very low, so try not to worry too much. Besides after the day you had let
alone the week, I think you need a little help to relax.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Seven agreed as she downed the half filled glass.</p>

<p>From what Seven had remembered from her first experience with alcohol, it
left her with a feeling of euphoria, almost to the point of actually being
happy. And Seven definitely thought that feeling anything other than the way
she was feeling now would be preferable. With the time it had taken Seven to go
down to sickbay and get checked out, she had come to terms with what she had
remembered and felt. After all it was in the past and Seven had an affinity for
being able to put the worst things behind her. It was inefficient to dwell on
the past but that's not what had Seven so upset now. Instead it was only after
the holodeck incident that she began to feel confused and very uncomfortable.
Confused because if she was reading into things correctly, Captain Katherine
Janeway was showing signs of amourous feelings toward Seven. Uncomfortable
because if Katherine was in love with Seven, Seven could not return those
feelings. It was true that Seven did love the Captain but as a mother or
beloved mentor, instead her heart belonged to another. And that's what had Seven
so upset. She didn't want to hurt Katherine but yet she could not betray the
love she felt for B'Elanna Torres. Seven had always felt a special connection
to Lanna; whether Lanna felt it too or not didn't matter. From the very
beginning, Torres managed to make Seven feel. True it was anger, hostility, and
frustration but they were all still human emotions. It took others like the
Captain months to get any emotional response out of her. Lanna made Seven feel
alive and a part of the Voyager collective. Everyone else treated her like the
Captain's pet borg and only tolerated her presence, never accepting it.
B'Elanna on the other hand treated her as an equal, she always spoke her mind,
and wasn't afraid to make it clear that she didn't want Seven there but was
willing to accept it because they needed Seven. Now the Klingon's and borg's
relationship had changed from that of adversaries to friends. And Seven found
that the engineer could inspire other emotions beside anger and frustration.
After the past week and the incident in the holodeck, Seven realized she wanted
their friendship to grow even further, it was only B'Elanna that she ever
wanted to be held by. And Seven thought that Lanna might want the same thing.
She wasn't sure mind you but Seven was more than willing to find out. The only
thing that stood in her way was the Captain. How could she be with B'Elanna
without hurting Katherine? For that she had no answer and Seven's face took on
a crestfallen look while she stared helplessly at the floor. Katherine noticed
the sadness that overcame Seven's normally impassive face and thought that
Seven must still be thinking about her parents. Taking Seven's chin between her
fingers, Katherine pulled Seven's face up until they were looking eye to eye.
Seven's eyes held more emotion than the Captain had ever seen there before but
it was an emotion that she wished never to be shown through the clear blue
eyes. Not really thinking, Katherine couldn't help herself as she leaned into
Seven and touched her lips with hers, wanting to erase some of the pain Seven
was feeling. Of course the synthahol had slowed down Seven's response time but
as soon as she realized what was happening she pulled back. Seven jumped up off
the couch, apologized profusely, and then ran right out of the room.</p>

<p>Seven ran through the corridors, not really seeing where she was going but
unconsciously heading for her own personal safe haven, cargo bay 2. Seven, for
the second time that night, was crying. How could she betray B'Elanna like
that? How could she betray the love she felt for B'Elanna? Now, she feared,
that Lanna would never want to be with her because she had no honor, no respect
for love. Of course, these emotions were all new to Seven and she found it
extremely difficult to sort out all that she felt and thought. Somewhere in
Seven's mind was a voice telling her how illogical, irrational, and irrelevant
her thoughts were. Too bad Seven couldn't think straight to realize this. As
soon as Seven entered cargo bay 2 she realized that she was not alone. Seven
tried to wipe away the tear tracks and pull herself together but it was a
complete waste of time. Even if B'Elanna had not seen the tears she would have
known something was wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, what's wrong?&quot; Lanna cried out as she ran to Seven's side.</p>

<p>&quot;It's... I... uh... she... &quot; Seven couldn't form more than one
word at a time. But that was all B'Elanna needed to hear; 'she'.</p>

<p>&quot;Janeway.&quot; B'Elanna growled as she flew out of the cargo bay like
a targ hunting it's prey.</p>

<p>Seven took a minute or two to finish composing herself and then ran out
after Lanna, hoping that she wouldn't do anything too stupid before Seven
reached her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Captain was cursing up a storm in her quarters. She cursed in
so many different languages that not even the computer could decipher it all.
Just as she had decided to go after Seven, Janeway, literally, bumped into
Chakotay who was sanding in front of her door.</p>

<p>&quot;Commander.&quot; The Captain rushed her greeting as she tried to move
past Chakotay. Unfortunately, Chakotay was having none of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, I just saw Seven run out of your quarters a minute ago. Is
she okay? What happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's none of your concern, Commander.&quot; Janeway realized that
sounded a bit harsh so she added, &quot;It's a persona matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Janeway left it at that and turned to continue on down the corridor. Only
she didn't get very far when she was met by a fist. Torres punched Janeway so
had that everyone around could here her nose cracking and see her flying back a
good few feet.</p>

<p>&quot;You, p'tach!&quot; What did you do to Seven!?&quot; B'Elanna screamed
at the top of her lungs while she towered over the fallen Captain.</p>

<p>Chakotay jumped over the bloody mess that was the Captain to come stand
between the two women. Just then Seven came up behind Lanna and grabbed her by
the arms effectively restraining her without hurting her.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna, please calm down. I am fine. I am the one you should be angry
at not the Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven tried to calm the Klingon down and to some degree she did but it was
all for nothing as the chef of security came upon the group. With the raise of
his eyebrow he was able to question everyone present without saying a word.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt. Tuvok, I want to press formal charges against Lt. B'Elanna Torres
for assaulting her captain. Place her in the brig until such time as I can
figure out a proper punishment for her.&quot; The Captain order through a very
nasal voice as Chakotay helped her up off the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Why you bitch! You're the one that hurt Seven and I'm the one going to
the brig?&quot; Torres fumed.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt., I want her out of my sight.&quot; Janeway screamed back.</p>

<p>Chakotay nodded his head in agreement but only because the engineer did
assault someone. Though he did have a feeling that there was more to this
story. Besides it might be better to keep Lanna locked up until this mess gets
straightened out. Seven followed Tuvok as he led Lanna away, unwilling to leave
her love alone while she stayed in the brig.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Captain. Let's have you looked at.&quot; Chakotay refered to
the broken nose as he led Janeway to sickbay.</p>
