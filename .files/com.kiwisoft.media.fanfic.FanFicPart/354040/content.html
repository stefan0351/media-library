<!-- Starlight \ Part 18 -->

<p>Buffy placed a soft kiss on Willow's shoulder, then followed that one kiss up by kissing her way up Willow's neck, then her jaw line, before finally coming to a stop on the hackers lips, which she explored thoroughly, though leisurely.</p>

<p>&#34;I can't feel my body,&#34; Buffy mumbled as she separated her lips from Willow's.</p>

<p>&#34;I LOVE to feel your body,&#34; Willow responded gutturally as her eyes started to shut. Then she seemed to realize what she had said and how she had said it causing her eyes to pop open and gape at Buffy.</p>

<p>The Slayer smiled.</p>

<p>&#34;After what we just did, I don't think that's gape worthy,&#34; Buffy responded gently. &#34;I'm quite fond of your body too,&#34; she continued smiling.</p>

<p>Willow responded by reaching out and tentatively placing her hand on Buffy's stomach caressing the skin there and being thoroughly absorbed doing it before slipping her hand around to the Slayers back and pulling her into a hug that Buffy willingly surrendered to.</p>

<p>&#34;It's like being in a dream,&#34; Willow said softly as they snuggled together. Her hand unconsciously tracing patterns on the Slayers back.</p>

<p>&#34;It's better than a dream,&#34; Buffy said as Willow rested her head on her shoulder.</p>

<p>They lay there together in a comfortable silence reveling in the warmth of their joined bodies and the feelings their closeness created within them.</p>

<p>&#34;I was thinking,&#34; Buffy said just as Willow as about to drift off to sleep.</p>

<p>&#34;About what?&#34; the hacker asked sleepily.</p>

<p>&#34;Do you think you're going to be needing your bed anymore?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>

<p>&#34;Why?&#34; Willow asked suspiciously. She had heard this tone from Buffy before and it never led to anything good.</p>

<p>&#34;I've always wanted a trampoline,&#34; Buffy said smiling. &#34;I think that one would look very nice over there. Plus, practice for my flips…well, once I learn how to do some flips.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow batted her in the stomach.</p>

<p>&#34;It was just a thought,&#34; Buffy responded before ducking her head to kiss Willow as a peace offering.</p>

<p>&#34;Think of something else,&#34; Willow replied her voice a mere whisper as her eyes closed.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, ma'am,&#34; Buffy said softly before placing a kiss on Willow's forehead and allowing her own eyes to close.</p>
