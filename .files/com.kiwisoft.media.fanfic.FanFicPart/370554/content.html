<p>Thanks again AliasSpyCrazy. Here ya go!</p>
<p>"I can't believe you danced with her," Mikayla said. Danced? They weren't really dancing, Lilly knew. They had been making out. She closed her eyes. <i>With a stranger, for God's sake! </i></p>
<p>"She asked me," Lilly said.</p>
<p>"You could have declined."</p>
<p>"She didn't give me a chance."</p>
<p>"She's here with Joannie."</p>
<p>"I know. And what about that? It must not be serious. Why don't you just go over and ask Joannie to dance?"</p>
<p>"I will not."</p>
<p>"You're being ridiculous," Lilly said. She wanted Joannie to go over. She wanted her to dance with Joannie. She wanted them to date. She wanted… Miley. She nearly groaned at her admission. God, the woman is sleeping with Mikayla's ex. Could it get any more complicated?</p>
<p>The workweek dragged by. Miley couldn't focus. Files were opened on her desk but her eyes only scanned them. All she could think about was the dance she'd shared with Lilly… and the kiss. Kisses, she clarified. And then it was over. She'd looked up and Lilly and Mikayla were gone. And Joannie wasn't speaking to her.</p>
<p>She spun her chair around and stared out the window. Downtown sprawled out around her. She looked out at the familiar high-rises, her thoughts still stuck on the blonde with green eyes. Saturday was still two days away but she had little hope that Lilly would actually keep their date. She would probably never see the woman again.</p>
<p>Actually, she still had a hard time believing she'd asked the woman to dance, much less kissed her. But she simply couldn't resist. Lilly had melted into her arms, had moved against her as if they'd done it thousands of times before. It was crazy, yes, but still, Miley felt it in her heart. Love at first sight.</p>
<p>She turned her chair back to her desk and picked up her mechanical pencil, tapping it lightly on the papers in front of her. She really didn't know what she would do if Lilly didn't show for breakfast. She could contact her through Mikayla, providing Joannie would give her Mikayla's phone number. And providing Mikayla would give her Lilly's number. It was a long shot, considering Joannie wasn't speaking to her.</p>
<p>She picked up her phone and punched out Joannie's work number. She would try again.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. Joannie's not available," the woman told her.</p>
<p>"It's Miley. Ask her to call me, please."</p>
<p>"Of course. I'll leave her another message."</p>
<p>Miley sighed. The fourth one in two days. Well, Joannie would get over it… eventually.</p>
<p>Lilly sat with her back to her desk, looking out the window of her 12th floor office, watching the window washers in the building across from her. As she'd been doing for the last half-hour. It wasn't like she didn't have work to do. Her desk was littered with case files. She just couldn't concentrate on them. The dark-haired beauty kept flashing through her mind. Oh, God. And the kiss. Just the thought of that made her stomach flip over and she crossed her arms, wishing she would stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>But she couldn't. She had met a woman at a bar, had said barely three sentences to her before ending up in her arms. Before kissing her. Yes, Lilly admitted. She had kissed Miley, too. She wanted to blame the other woman, but the only blame was that Miley had asked her to dance. The kiss, well, it was definitely mutual.</p>
<p>And on Saturday, she was supposed to meet her for breakfast. She closed her eyes. Would she go? If she had any sense, she would stay far, far away from Miley. She was a stranger. She knew absolutely nothing about the woman. Well, other than the fact that she fit perfectly in her arms and the woman could kiss her senseless. That much was obvious. And then there was the small matter of Miley dating her best friend's ex. It was much too complicated. No, she wouldn't go. She would be breaking both of her rules with one shot if she went.</p>
<p>At the light tap on her door, she spun back around to her desk and quickly picked up a file.</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>Mikayla stuck her head in, carrying an armload of files.</p>
<p>"Mr. Bryant asked me to give these to you. The Hoffman divorce."</p>
<p>Lilly looked at her crowded desk.</p>
<p>"Find a corner," she said. Then she leaned back. Mikayla had been avoiding her for the last two days. "What's going on? You've hardly spoken to me."</p>
<p>Mikayla looked as if she might just leave without answering, but she walked back over and sat in one of Lilly's guest chairs.</p>
<p>"Are you going to meet her?" she asked.</p>
<p>Lilly sighed. She wished she'd never told Mikayla that Miley had invited her to breakfast. Thank goodness Mikayla had not witnessed the kiss out on the dance floor.</p>
<p>"I haven't decided. Probably not. No, I don't think so," she said. "I mean, she's a stranger."</p>
<p>"I think you should go," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, maybe you could find out some information about Joannie. See how serious they are, how long they've been dating," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"Serious? How serious can it be if she's invited me to breakfast?"</p>
<p>"It's just breakfast. It's not like it's a dinner date."</p>
<p>Lilly stared at Mikayla. Oh, it was a date, all right. The look in Miley's eyes told her it was a date. Well, that and the kiss told her it was a date.</p>
<p>"Why do you want information on Joannie? I thought you didn't like her that much," Lilly said.</p>
<p>"I like her. I mean, it's not like I've got women lining up, you know."</p>
<p>"Then why did you break things off?"</p>
<p>"I told you, she was starting to get serious. It scared me."</p>
<p>Lilly leaned forward and lowered her voice.</p>
<p>"You never told me. Did you sleep together?" Mikayla blushed. "I see," Lilly murmured. "And what's wrong with that?"</p>
<p>"Oh God, Lilly. I liked her. That's what's wrong with that. I could have fallen in love with her."</p>
<p>"And what is wrong with that? Isn't that what we're all hoping to do?"</p>
<p>"It's your damn rules! You've brainwashed me! I met her in a bar! How far could it go? So I fall in love with her? Then what? She gets tired of it and moves on. Like she'd done with this woman you're going out with."</p>
<p>"She moved on because you told her to move on," Lilly reminded her.</p>
<p>"It was easier than having her tell me to move on," Mikayla said quietly.</p>
<p>"That's just crazy. That's like giving up, Mikayla. You like the woman. She obviously liked you. Why don't you give it a try?" Lilly suggested.</p>
<p>"Well, there's the little problem of the new woman she's dating."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, there's that."</p>
<p>Mikayla's eyes widened and she leaned forward. "You could pretend you really like her. You could ask her out. You could take her away from Joannie," she said in a rush.</p>
<p>"Are you out of your mind?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to really date her. It's not like you have to sleep with her or anything. Just make her think that you like her. Get her to stop seeing Joannie," Mikayla plotted.</p>
<p>"I will not."</p>
<p>"I thought we were friends. Why won't you do this for me?"</p>
<p><i>Oh, shit. </i>"Okay. I'll meet her for breakfast. Beyond that, I'm not promising anything," Lilly said.</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>
<p>Miley still stood in her jogging shorts and bra, looking silently at her closet. Her cat sat importantly next to her, staring inside as she was. Jeans? No, too casual. Slacks and button down? She cocked her head to the side, then shook her head. No, not right for breakfast. Jeans and sweater? No, all her sweaters were too dressy. Slacks and sweater? No, still not breakfast.</p>
<p>"Okay. Jeans and <i>something</i>," she murmured. "That'll work, right?"</p>
<p>Sweatshirt? No, way too casual. <i>Shit</i>. She probably wouldn't even show. What's the big deal? Sweatshirt it is.</p>
<p>"Okay. Move. You're not going in there," she said, moving the cat away with her foot.</p>
<p>She hurried through her shower, not wanting to be late. She was nervous as hell, but she still doubted Lilly would show up. She was still drying her hair at eight-thirty. She quickly pulled on jeans and sneakers, then stood naked from the waist up as she sorted through her sweatshirts. Athletic ones? No. She tossed them aside, finding her collection of wildlife sweatshirts. She scratched her temple as she debated over the wolf and the eagle.</p>
<p>"Shit. Just pick one."</p>
<p>She turned to Garfield and held them up.</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>He yawned.</p>
<p>"You're a big help."</p>
<p>She settled on the wolf, slipping it over her naked body in one motion. She flipped her hair back and took one last look in the mirror. Her eyes were wild. Yes, the wolf was a good choice.</p>
<p>Lilly parked two blocks away. She was ten minutes early. She took a deep breath, then glanced at herself in the mirror. Her hair was as unruly as ever and she brushed at it with her fingers. She should have worn more makeup. Her face looked flushed. Then she remembered Miley's face, not noticing any makeup. Maybe Miley liked women natural, without makeup.</p>
<p>"Oh, God! Like it matters," she murmured.</p>
<p>Then she glanced at her jeans, thinking she probably should have worn slacks. She looked too casual. But that was what she intended. She didn't want Miley to think she was dressing up for her.</p>
<p>"This is crazy," she whispered, looking once more in the mirror. She couldn't believe how nervous she was. It was only breakfast, she told herself. Then she remembered her promise to Mikayla. Pretend to like her? Pretend to date her? She had been insane to agree to this. She suspected Miley was not one to play with. It could be very dangerous. She had lost complete control in seconds, had ended up kissing her <i>on the dance floor. </i>She couldn't do it. She would end up…. in bed with her.</p>
<p>"No. Absolutely not."</p>
<p>Finally, the minutes ticked away and she made herself move. She never once considered Miley might not show up.</p>
<p>She walked slowly down the sidewalk. It was warm for February, sunny and bright, hinting at Spring. A beautiful morning, really. But it was with a nervous hand that she pulled open the door. And there Miley was, standing just inside, dressed as casually as she was. She watched as Miley turned, as if sensing her presence. Their eyes met and a soft smile appeared on Miley's face. Lilly matched it.</p>
<p>"You came," Miley said quietly.</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. Miley walked closer, her eyes never leaving Lilly's. She looked even more beautiful than she remembered.</p>
<p>"It's warm out. Would you rather sit on the patio or inside?" Miley asked.</p>
<p>"Outside, I think," Lilly said.</p>
<p>"Good. Come on."</p>
<p>Lilly felt Miley's light touch on her back as she led her through the doors to the patio. They picked a table in the sun and sat across from each other. Lilly folded her hands in her lap and Miley leaned her elbows on the table. Their eyes locked again.</p>
<p>"I was afraid you wouldn't come," Miley said.</p>
<p>"Actually, I didn't think I would come, either," Lilly admitted. "I don't normally do this. I don't even know you."</p>
<p>"Miley Stewart. I'm a CPA with Stewart and Stewart. Family thing," she said when Lilly raised her eyebrows. "I'm thirty-three. I live alone with a fat cat named Garfield." Again a raised eyebrow. "I know. But trust me… he's Garfield. I don't cook, but I know a lot of great restaurants. I jog. I'm not… a stalker or anything. I'm not… strange. I'm… "</p>
<p>"Okay," She laughed. "Tell me about Joannie."</p>
<p>"Joannie? You want to talk about Joannie?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You're dating her, right? Does she know you're here with me?"</p>
<p>Miley sighed. No, Joannie didn't know. She would if she'd taken any of Miley's calls, but no.</p>
<p>"No, she doesn't know. But that hardly matters."</p>
<p>"It matters. Look, Miley, I have rules."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. You don't date anyone you met at a bar and… "</p>
<p>"Why did you ask me here?" Lilly interrupted.</p>
<p>"You know why," Miley said quietly.</p>
<p>"You're dating someone."</p>
<p>Miley looked away. Jesus, Joannie would kill her if she told Lilly the truth and it got back to Mikayla.</p>
<p>"It's not… serious," she said weakly.</p>
<p>"If it's not serious, why didn't you tell her you'd made plans with me?"</p>
<p>"She's not taking my calls," Miley said truthfully.</p>
<p>"Why? Did she see us dancing?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Lilly nodded. "Look, Joannie and I . . . that was our first date," she said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. This is just breakfast, right?" Lilly pointed out.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Yes. Just breakfast."</p>
<p>"No. I want to see you. I want to… "</p>
<p>"No," Lilly said. "I have rules."</p>
<p>"I'm not seeing Joannie," Miley insisted.</p>
<p>"You're dating."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"No?"</p>
<p>Miley reached across the table and captured Lilly's hand. "Please. I can explain," Miley said.</p>
<p>"So explain."</p>
<p>"I can't."</p>
<p>"You just said you could."</p>
<p>"I'm extremely attracted to you," Miley said.</p>
<p>Lilly sighed. She glanced at their clasped hands, thinking she should pull hers away. She didn't. <i>Damn!</i> She looked up and met Miley's dark eyes. They pulled her in. She dropped her eyes to Miley's lips. It was a mistake. They were back on the dance floor… locked together, tongues dueling, mouths mating. She remembered how she'd felt as she pressed close to Miley's body, how their breasts had been touching as they danced. <i>Oh, Jesus.</i></p>
<p>"You feel it too," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>Lilly met her eyes again. Yes, she felt it, too. But, damn, she had rules. Then she remembered her promise to Mikayla. Could she go through with this? Could she lure Miley away from Joannie? Maybe, but at what price?</p>
<p>"Yes," she finally said.</p>
<p>Miley's eyes softened. Yes, but at what price, Lilly thought again. "Please tell me about yourself," Miley urged.</p>
<p>Lilly tilted her head, then slowly withdrew her hand from Miley's. She folded them again in her lap.</p>
<p>"Lilly Truscott. Attorney. Smith and Calhoun. I'm thirty-two. I live alone. I don't have a cat. I <i>can</i> cook," she said with a smile. "No jogging."</p>
<p>Miley laughed. "We sound like personal ads," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, we do."</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "So attorney? Like a defense lawyer?"</p>
<p>"Nothing that exciting. We are a small firm. Mostly civil cases."</p>
<p>Miley nodded again. "You don't look like an attorney," Miley said. Lilly looked very comfortable in her jeans. Although she could easily picture her in a business suit. She would be beautiful.</p>
<p>"And you don't exactly look like an accountant," Lilly murmured. Jeans and sweatshirt. And God, her face was flawless. Beautiful.</p>
<p>"Good morning, ladies," their waiter greeted them. "Coffee?"</p>
<p>They both nodded. They were silent as coffee was served, both quietly watching the other.</p>
<p>"Have you decided?" he asked.</p>
<p>Miley continued to stare at Lilly and Lilly couldn't seem to pull her eyes away.</p>
<p>"Omelet," Lilly said without thinking.</p>
<p>"Okay. What kind? We've got… "</p>
<p>"Just… vegetables and cheese," she said.</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "That sounds fine. I'll have the same."</p>
<p>"Two omelets, coming right up."</p>
<p>He disappeared and still their stare could not be broken. Lilly felt her breathing increase, felt her heart as it pounded against her chest. God, those eyes. They were dangerous.</p>
<p>Miley leaned forward, arms folded across the table. "The next time we kiss, I really hope we are totally alone," she whispered.</p>
<p>Lilly's breath caught. "What makes you think there will be a next time?" she asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Do you doubt there will be?"</p>
<p>"No," Lilly whispered. In fact, it took all of her willpower not to move across the table and kiss Miley right here, right now.</p>
<p>"You have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen," Miley said softly. "They've been haunting my dreams."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded. Yes, she knew all about dreams. These dark, intense eyes had been haunting hers, as well.</p>
<p>"I don't even know you," Lilly whispered. "How can you do this to me?"</p>
<p>"Do what?"</p>
<p>"Make me crazy like this." She finally pulled her eyes away. "What happened the other night… I just don't do that," she admitted.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. But it's not like I make of habit of it myself," Miley said.</p>
<p>"That's just it. How do I know you don't?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "I don't go to bars."</p>
<p>"I don't either."</p>
<p>"Then isn't it strange we met there?"</p>
<p>Lilly tried to remember why she had her rules. There must have been a reason, but she couldn't think of one now. This woman, this beautiful woman that she'd met at a bar, was making it very hard for her to stick by her rules. And God, she didn't want to play with her, to take Mikayla's advice and <i>pretend </i>to date her. And then there was Joannie. What was Joannie to this woman? Just a first date that Miley had ditched so that she could have breakfast with her?</p>
<p>None of that really mattered when she looked into Miley's eyes. She cursed the thoughts running rampant through her mind. She could see them together, kissing… as they had been that night on the dance floor. She could see them kissing… and making love. She groaned silently. Yes, she could see them making love.</p>
<p>"Tell me what you're thinking," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Miley reached across the table and captured her hand again. Lilly's fingers entwined with hers immediately.</p>
<p>"You know you can't fight this," Miley stated.</p>
<p>"I know," Lilly admitted. And she couldn't. Damn her rules! What she was thinking was totally insane. But she voiced her thoughts anyway. "I'd really like to meet… Garfield," she whispered.</p>
<p>Miley nearly dropped her coffee cup.</p>
<p>"Now?"</p>
<p>"Now," Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>Neither noticed the waiter as he approached with their breakfast. "Here we go, ladies. Anything else? More coffee?"</p>
<p>"The check," Miley murmured. She slowly pulled her eyes away from Lilly's and looked at the waiter. "Now."</p>
<p>"Of course. Is there something not to your liking?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Kind of in a hurry," Miley said.</p>
<p>"Of course. Would you like me to box these to go then?"</p>
<p>"No!" they said in unison. Lilly blushed as the waiter looked from one to the other.</p>
<p>"I see. Of course."</p>
<p>Miley's hand trembled as she pulled money from her pocket and laid it on the table. Her heart was pounding and she tried to catch her breath.</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't believe what she was about to do. She pushed her thoughts away. If she thought about it, she would run. And she definitely didn't want to run. Not now. Not when Miley's eyes promised so much.</p>
<p>"I live only five minutes from here. Follow me?" Miley asked.</p>
<p>Lilly nodded. She was afraid to speak. They stood and she followed Miley out to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"There," Miley pointed. "The black car."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded again. She walked to her own car and dropped her keys before she could disengage the alarm. She picked them up nervously, her hands trembling as she opened the door.</p>
<p>"Don't think about it," she whispered. "Don't think about it."</p>
<p>She pulled away, following closely behind Miley. Actually, she didn't have time to think. Before she knew it, they were parking again. She took a deep breath, then got out, walking silently beside Miley, through the courtyard and past the pool, to her apartment.</p>
<p>Miley closed the door behind them and they faced each other. Lilly saw Miley's chest heave, her breathing as ragged as her own. She didn't look around the apartment, her eyes were only on Miley.</p>
<p>The tiny part of sanity that Miley clung to told her they were rushing things but those green eyes pulled her. She walked closer, her hand finally coming out to brush at the hair around Lilly's face, something she had wanted to do since she had first glimpsed her across the dance floor. Lilly's eyes closed slowly and Miley dropped her own gaze to the lips that had been tormenting her dreams for the last few nights. She finally closed the distance, lightly touching Lilly's lips with her own.</p>
<p>Lilly moaned at the soft touch, then opened her lips slightly, kissing Miley back. Then there was nothing else; no questions, no thoughts, no words. Just the wild hunger that claimed them both.</p>
<p>Lilly's arms went around Miley the same instant that Miley pulled her close, fitting her body with her own. Lilly's hands moved into the silky tresses and she groaned as Miley's tongue slipped past her lips.</p>
<p>Miley pulled away, then found the throbbing pulse in Lilly's neck. Her teeth nipped gently at her throat, sucking lightly against her pulse.</p>
<p>Lilly bent her head back, offering herself to Miley. Her eyes remained closed and she moaned again as Miley's mouth moved against her. Then gentle, timid hands moved up, lightly caressing her breasts and Lilly gasped when Miley's fingers found her nipples, gently squeezing them.</p>
<p>She clung to Miley, her legs refusing to support her a second longer. Then a hard thigh moved between her legs, pressing intimately against her. Lilly's hips bucked when Miley made contact with her hot center. Never in her life had she wanted someone's touch as she now wanted, needed Miley's.</p>
<p>She whimpered when Miley pulled away and her eyes opened, finding Miley's dark ones still so close to her own. Then Miley took her hand and Lilly followed, her legs nearly giving out when they reached the bedroom.</p>
<p>She stood by silently as Miley pulled the covers back. Then, Miley came back to her, her hands moving to Lilly's waist, moving easily under her sweatshirt, touching warm flesh. Lilly's muscles contracted as those hands moved higher and she locked her gaze with Miley's. She trembled when Miley touched her breasts, light fingers moving across her lacy bra.</p>
<p>Then Miley pulled her hands away, lifting her own shirt over her head and pulling it off. Lilly's breath caught. Miley wore no bra. Without thinking, her hands went to her, cupping Miley's bare breasts with warm hands. She moaned as Miley's nipples hardened. She bent down, taking one with her mouth.</p>
<p>"Yes," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>Lilly pulled back, barely able to breathe. She was on fire for this woman, this stranger. It didn't matter. She quickly pulled her own shirt off, then Miley's hands were there, peeling her bra away. She saw as Miley held her breath, her eyes raising from her breasts to lock on her blue eyes. Lilly felt nearly burned by the hungry desire she saw there.</p>
<p>Miley was certain she'd never seen a more beautiful sight. She was almost afraid to touch her. But Lilly took her hands and pulled them to her breasts. Miley trembled as she cupped them, watching in fascination as the nipples hardened. Then Lilly's hands moved to her jeans, unbuttoning them and pushing them slowly down Miley's hips.</p>
<p>Miley could stand it no longer. She stepped out of them quickly, her own hands in a rush as they fumbled with Lilly's button. Lilly helped her, pushing them down, standing now as naked as Miley was.</p>
<p>Miley pulled her to the bed, covering her, easing her weight on top of Lilly. Lilly's legs opened, her hips moving instinctively to meet Miley. She felt her own wetness coat her thighs and her hands guided Miley's mouth to her lips. Her mouth opened, taking Miley's tongue inside and she sucked it hard into her mouth. She heard Miley groan, meeting each thrust of Miley's hips as they strained to touch. Then Miley's hot mouth found her breast and it was Lilly's turn to groan. Her hands held Miley to her as Miley's tongue swirled around her nipple before sucking it inside her mouth. Lilly trembled, so afraid she would have an orgasm right then.</p>
<p>"Touch me," she whispered. "Go inside me," she begged.</p>
<p>Miley's hand moved between them, sliding across Lilly's thigh then up, finding the wet silk that greeted her fingers. She pulled her mouth away, watching Lilly's face as her fingers slid through her wetness and entered her.</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes closed as she felt Miley go inside her. Her hips rose up to meet her then she pulled Miley back to her breast. As Miley's mouth suckled her, Lilly's hips rolled, meeting each thrust of Miley's fingers as she moved in and out of her wetness. Her entire body trembled as she felt her orgasm build, threatening to explode with each thrust of Miley's hand.</p>
<p>Miley felt the trembling, felt the muscles tighten around her fingers. With her hips, she pushed her own hand harder against Lilly, rocking into her until Lilly screamed out. She finally slowed, leaving her fingers inside the warm wetness as Lilly clutched her to her.</p>
<p>"Oh Miley," Lilly whispered. She lay back, spent, her eyes still closed. She finally relaxed, opening her thighs enough so that Miley's fingers slipped away from her. She felt light kisses move over her breasts to her neck, finally to her lips.</p>
