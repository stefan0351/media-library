<p><b>Chapter Six: What's Cooking Good Looking?</b></p>
<p>Lilly was a nervous wreck when it came to the following day of school. She had tried to fake sick but neither her parents were home, simply her brother who didn't care to listen, as he was too occupied with feeding their dog toothpaste.</p>
<p>So alas, she had no other option but to go to school and face up to her fears and the "could bes". She quickly put on a pair of long pinstriped shorts, a green element hat, her Globe shoes, 2 Bonds chesties and lastly a blue and green Bonds hoodie. She did her hair I many miniature braids today and put on her usual amount of make-up. She didn't bother making herself a real breakfast, just poured herself a glass of orange juice.</p>
<p>Soon after the doorbell rang, and she opened it to find Miley and Oliver patiently. She welcomed them in warmly.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'll be another minute." She often found herself apologising like that in the mornings, especially when she had been having dreams of Miley.</p>
<p>While Lilly raced around, putting books in her messenger bag, and brushing her teeth, Miley and Oliver played with the now very disturbing looking dog. The dog loved all the attention it was getting so much that it decide to lick Miley on the face and manage to get toothpaste all over her.</p>
<p>When Lilly finished her running around she returned to the room she left Miley and Oliver waiting, she immediately noticed that Miley was covered in toothpaste.</p>
<p>"It was the dog." Oliver said suspiciously, hiding the toothpaste container behind his back. To any other it might seem that Oliver was guilty, however Lilly knew better. Oliver was just a donut.</p>
<p>Both Miley and Lilly laughed and rolled their eyes. Lilly knew her friend could not go to school dressed like that, it was an invitation for Amber and Ashley to humiliate her.</p>
<p>"You can borrow some of my clothes." She took Miley by the hand and pulled her towards her bedroom. "Ok…So what do you want to wear?" she asked and just as she did, certain thoughts couldn't help but enter her mind. 'Miley is going to be wearing my clothes and she'll be changing clothes in my bedroom.' Lilly blushed at the picture her mind created of Miley in her underwear.</p>
<p>"Ummm…" Miley looked through all Lilly's clothes and chose a pair of skinny leg jeans, a green t-shirt with a skatebrand written on the side on the midst of vines and thorns, and a blue knit hoodie jumper.</p>
<p>"Come out when you're ready." Lilly said before leaving her best friend and ultimate crush to get changed. From behind the door, she heard fumbling and after a moment of silence Blink 182 was blasting out of her stereo. Lilly laughed silently to herself before rolling her eyes. It was just so typical of Miley.</p>
<p>"Lilly! Lilly!" Oliver called running down the hallway. He had a look of distress plastered on his face. "I was making some eggs and bacon and the next you know…the stove is on fire!" He breathed heavily. "I got it out though."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, afraid of what her kitchen now looked like. She walked cautiously over to the room and immediately was confronted by an image of pure horror. Everything was either burnt or knocked to the ground. Sighing, she started to help pick up the knocked items and put them back to where they belonged.</p>
<p>Just as they finished cleaning that part of the mess up, Miley appeared wearing Lilly's clothes. Miley looked flushed, causing Lilly herself to turn a deep red colour.</p>
<p>"You look great."</p>
<p>"Thanks" Miley then noticed the mess. "Wow, what happened here?</p>
<p>Oliver, looking up from the spot he was scrubbing then noticed her other female friend. "I attempted to cook. I'm really sorry Lilly." Both girls just rolled heir eyes at Oliver's foolish behaviour.</p>
<p>It took a further hour to clean the whole kitchen and so the trio did not arrive at school till after lunch, each receiving an hours detention after school.</p>
<p>And in that whole day, Lilly forgot her worries about what would happen because of the conversation with Jake. She just as living life, and stealing moment to perve at Miley in her own clothes.</p>
<p><b>A/N: YAY, another chapter ended.I personally liked the way this one ended, so I would like to know what you think… Of course I've found listening to music in Japanese and trying to type in English isn't the smartest idea, especially since I'm trying to write English, translate the Japanese to English in my head AND sing the Japanese. LOL.</b></p>
<p><b>A/N: Listen to Sekai Ni Hitotsu Dake No Hana by SMAP. I love it…that or Shingo Mama No Oha, by one of the guys from SMAP. HAHA, it's a pisser of a song. OHA!</b></p>
