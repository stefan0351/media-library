<!-- We'll Always Have Paris \ Chapter 8 -->

<p>They were completely unprepared for the sight that greeted them when they entered the house.  The entire room was radiant with the light of a hundred candles, and there was a fire burning in the fireplace, the faint smell of incense lingered in the air.  The dining room table was set with silver gleaming in the candlelight.  Stasis trays were set out on the table with a complete meal prepared and kept warm for them.  There were several gifts wrapped and set out on one of the couches.</p>

<p>They just stared at the house and then at one another.</p>

<p>"Did you know anything about this?" B'Elanna queried.</p>

<p>"I, no, I did not."</p>

<p>Stepping further into the room they noticed a card lying on the table, upon reading it they realized that Sam and Neelix were responsible for the dinner; the card wished them nothing but the best and brought tears to both of their eyes.</p>

<p>Janeway had replicated a wonderful dress for Seven to wear to dinner this evening. Her card read 'Dearest Seven: I've always thought of you as a friend and a daughter to me, and so I hope you won't mind your 'mother' picking out clothes for you to wear on a special night like this.  I wish you all the love and happiness in the world.  I can't think of anyone more perfect for you than B'Elanna. Take some advice from one who knows, don't be afraid, don't hold anything back, just love her as much as I know she loves you.   Love always.  Your friend Katherine.'</p>

<p>B'Elanna found a package with her name on it from Harry and Tom as well, the dress it contained was a stunning black cocktail dress of the type B'Elanna would never normally wear.  There was also a PADD with a music file they had created for the pair.  Tom wrote: 'I will be looking after Kate tomorrow morning, so just enjoy the night, and the morning.  I have to admit I feel a little weird getting a dress for you to wear on your first night with another woman, but I figured that seeing as I was such a failure as a husband at least I can prove how much I care for you by being a friend. Love Tom.'</p>

<p>Harry's note was addressed to 'Maquis' and teased that B'Elanna should suck it up and dress like a girl for a change, and that he couldn't be happier for his friend.</p>

<p>The candles, incense and the chilled bottle of Dom Perignon they found on ice in the bedroom was apparently courtesy of Chakotay.  He wrote them that he had performed a sweetgrass ritual to bless the house and bring them luck, and that he wished them light and love in intoxicating measure as they began their life together.</p>

<p>Even Naomi Wildman had made a contribution.  B'Elanna joked that if the night wasn't what they expected that at least they could play Kadis Kot now that Naomi had given them a board!</p>

<p>The unexpected and emotional gesture of love and acceptance from their friends was completely overwhelming and for a long time they could only stare in wonder at the beauty around them.  Finally B'Elanna broke the silence, suggesting that they shower and dress for dinner before the candles burned completely away.</p>

<p>B'Elanna felt strange dressed up in a cocktail dress, like a little kid playing dress-up; she was tempted to change into jeans but remembered Harry's admonition to 'suck it up' so she remained in the dress.  Her reward was the look of absolute wonder on Seven's face when she caught sight of the young engineer.  B'Elanna felt herself blushing under Seven's gaze and forced a light note into her voice as she opened a bottle of wine and suggested that they have dinner.</p>

<p>Seven had downloaded the music file into the computer and soft piano music was playing as they ate.  The meal was wonderful, Neelix had taken special care to avoid his usual overkill with spices, and every dish was a sensation of flavour and texture.  When the meal began they talked nonstop about the day and about their friends, and the wonderful gift they had been given.  However, by the end of the meal the seriousness of the occasion seemed to overwhelm them and they grew quiet.</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a few moments after they finished eating, listening to the music, both lost in their thoughts.  B'Elanna finally stood and moved around the table, offering her hand to Seven, leading her into the middle of the living room and taking her into her arms.  They danced together slowly, their bodies pressed close, moving together as one.  When the song ended B'Elanna kept hold of Seven's hand and led her slowly toward the bedroom.</p>

<p>Once in the room she opened the bottle of Champagne and poured them both a glass.  They raised their glasses together in a silent toast and then B'Elanna began to speak.</p>

<p>"Seven, there's something I want to tell you, something you need to know. This isn't easy for me but I really need to say it. You are my heart and my soul, I feel like I'm only half-alive when you aren't with me. Nothing in my life ever prepared me for this feeling, and I have to be honest, it's the most frightening thing I've ever felt, and the most wonderful. You of all people know that there are two sides of me and they have been at war for as long as I can remember, but now, in your arms I'm truly at peace. I never dreamed it was possible to feel this way, and even now I can hardly dare believe that its real. You are my world, my universe, and my love; I would die for you, do battle for you, do anything you ever asked of me&#151;I could deny you nothing. I just want you to know that in this moment, right here right now, you are completely and utterly loved."</p>

<p>Tears were running down B'Elanna's cheeks as she spoke, and Seven herself was crying tears of joy.  Never in her life had she imagined that anyone would ever feel that way about her, a former Borg drone.  She reached out a hand to B'Elanna's cheek and brushed away the tears.</p>

<p>"I am not the person I was when I first met you B'Elanna," Seven began. "I am different, better somehow, and that is in part because of you; you make me whole. I want to be your peace, your shelter, your heart's home.  Let me be your lodestone and our love the compass.  That way no matter where you are you need only follow your heart to find your way home to me. I want you to know that if I live forever there will never be enough time to show you how much I love you.  I will never have the words to describe the depth of my love for you, but I want you to know that even if all we have is here and now, if there are no more tomorrows, I will always be grateful that I had the chance to be with you."</p>

<p>Exhausted by the unaccustomed expression of emotion they held one another close, snuggling together and simply feeling the connection between them for a few moments.  When they felt more in control of their emotions, they sat back and simply drank in the sight of one another.  B'Elanna refilled their glasses and they enjoyed the taste of the exquisite champagne.</p>

<p>B'Elanna stood, drawing Seven up with her, setting their glasses aside she pulled Seven into her arms, allowing her hands to wander over the young drone's back and shoulders.  Seven captured her lips in a kiss that began as a tentative exploration, but quickly turned into a searing expression of passion.  They pressed their bodies close, feeling the firm flesh pressed full length against her, Seven moaned her approval.  Her fingers found their way up to the slender straps of B'Elanna's dress and she slid them off those powerful shoulders; undoing the dress she allowed it to pool on the floor at their feet.  B'Elanna had not been wearing a bra and now her exposed breasts were pressed against Seven, she gasped at the sensation of her nipples sliding against the silk fabric of the younger woman's dress.</p>

<p>B'Elanna undid the zip in the back of the sheath that Seven was wearing, and, stepping back, peeled away the fabric with slow sensual deliberation.  Once freed from the constraints of their clothing they stretched out on the bed, laying on their sides, facing one another, limbs tangled, hands explored, lips and tongues met and mingled.</p>

<p>Drawing back B'Elanna smiled into the brilliant eyes of her lover, "Kahless, I feel like I could drown in your eyes, they're so blue.  You are so beautiful, do you know that?"</p>

<p>"Only with you my love, only when you look at me, then I am beautiful," Seven meant what she said, she knew others found her aesthetically pleasing, but only when B'Elanna gazed so lovingly at her did she feel truly beautiful.</p>

<p>"I love you Seven," she kissed her passionately, slowly beginning an erotic exploration of the delicate curve of Seven's neck.  "God how I want to taste you."</p>

<p>Seven whimpered at the combined effect of B'Elanna's words and actions.  She was pure sensation in these moments, as if nothing existed outside of the touch of her lover.  "Make love to me please B'Elanna."</p>

<p>B'Elanna growled her pleasure at her lover's words.  She gently pushed Seven onto her back, slowly spreading her legs and lying between them.  She caressed her tongue along Seven's swan-like neck, smelling the clean fresh scent, feeling the blood that pounded beneath the flawless skin, losing herself in the sensations.  She rained kisses in a fiery trail that led to first one beautiful breast and then the other. Swirling her tongue ever closer before finally capturing the straining nipples. Seven moaned her pleasure as she felt B'Elanna's mouth finally close on her sensitized flesh.  While she continued to suck gently on Seven's luscious breast, she used her fingers to stimulate the other one, slowly rolling the rose coloured tip between her fingers while Seven writhed beneath her touch.</p>

<p>Seven's need was growing ever stronger as B'Elanna continued her exquisite sensual torture.  The throbbing between her legs was growing steadily and she knew she needed to find relief.  She captured the hand B'Elanna was using to caress her breast and guided it slowly down between her legs,</p>

<p>"Please B'Elanna, I need you, touch me, god please."</p>

<p>B'Elanna swooned at the raw need in Seven's voice, and she allowed her hand to slip inside the heated flesh of Seven's sex; her nether lips as soft as rose petals in the rain.  She parted the burning wet flesh with her fingertips and began slowly stroking up and down her full length.  She traced slowly around the secret opening while Seven thrust her hips up into her touch.</p>

<p>"Please, inside me, please."</p>

<p>B'Elanna complied with the impassioned request, slipping first one and then two fingers inside the hot tight core.  She began moving with Seven's rhythm, increasing her speed to match the need she felt growing in the younger woman.  She shifted downward to capture the sensitive nexus of nerves in her lips, sucking and rolling the tiny bundle in her mouth as Seven moaned and pitched beneath her.</p>

<p>"Oh B'Elanna, god yes, yes ahhhh B'Elanna," she finally climaxed with a throaty roar.</p>

<p>B'Elanna held on through the aftermath, continuing to gently stroke the now-satiated flesh until Seven pulled her up to capture her lips in a sweet kiss, snuggling into the strong arms of her lover.</p>

<p>Seven's lovemaking, when it came, was as intense and as all encompassing as the woman herself.  B'Elanna loved the way that the younger woman explored every nook and cranny of her body with hands, eyes, and tongue.  She felt completely known in a way that was new to her, there was nowhere to hide from that loving gaze, not that she wanted to hide.  Seven made love to every inch of her body; caressing the ridges of her forehead and back, tracing the outline of the muscles of her abdomen and shoulders, and kissing every finger, toe, and inch of delicious skin before making love to B'Elanna with a skill and understanding that belied her inexperience.</p>

<p>While they had each achieved a measure of release with their initial lovemaking neither was satiated, and they spent the night exploring hungrily, touching lovingly, pleasuring endlessly until at last they slept the sleep of the exhausted in one another's arms.</p>
