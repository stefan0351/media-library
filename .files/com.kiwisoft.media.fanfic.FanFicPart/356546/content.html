<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 7 -->

<p>Willow woke up trembling from the disturbing dream. In it
 Buffy was
being chased by a mass of pure evil from which
 she couldn't escape. It
was terrible because not only was
 it was killing her beloved. It was
doing it in slow
 torturous stages.</p>

<p>Every time Willow had tried to help
 the dream Buffy, the magic attacked
her lover weakening her
 resistance further. Willow shook her head trying
to clear
 the terrifying vision from her mind. She reached for her
 lover
needing reassurance and panicked when she found her
 gone.</p>

<p>Choking down the sick bile that rose in her
 throat the witch noticed the
sun streaming into the bedroom
 window and relaxed.</p>

<p>"The sun must've woken her up and
 she went to the bathroom or for a run
or something." Willow
 reasoned with herself gaining control of her
rapidly
 beating heart.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the clock told her it
 was still very early. For the
second time in less than a
 month she wondered at her fast recovery from
using her
 magic to the point of exhaustion. For all intents and
 purposes
she should have been out of it until noon and
 still be wasted for
another day or two. There really should
 be no possible way that she was
awake and ready to go
 at-she rechecked the clock--the ungoddessly hour
of eight
 in the morning!</p>

<p>She sat up to wait for her wayward
 soulmate to return, listening
intently for her lover's soft
 steps. While stretching, she thought
contentedly about the
 kind of punishment for her fiances return. It was
almost an
 unwritten rule that neither was to leave the other alone
 the
morning after a battle like they had the night before.
 &nbsp;
Buffy was in definite need of a lesson in manners
 and Willow knew
exactly how she was going to teach her.</p>

<p>After thirty minutes, when Buffy hadn't returned,
 Willow decided it was
time to get up and fix breakfast. It
 was obvious that Buffy must have
gone for a run or over to
 Giles' for some training and wouldn't be back
until
 afternoon.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't blame her slayer for
 thinking she wouldn't be awake for
a while yet. But still,
 something just didn't 'feel' right about Buffy
leaving her
 this morning.
They always waited for each other to wake-up
 no matter how long it took.</p>

<p>She sighed. &lt;&gt; Might
 as well go get dressed and at least check over
 at
Giles'.&lt;&gt; She thought pulling on some sweats. She
 was on her way out of
the house when she noticed a light
 coming from under the downstairs
bathroom door.</p>

<p>Relieved and curious as to why Buffy would come all the
 way down here
Willow knocked; then she began to get worried
 when she got no response.
"Buffy, open the door. Are you
 hurt?" She called out.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;I'll bet she's trying
 to hide those damn nightmares again.&lt;&gt; Willow
thought
 angrily. &lt;&gt;I don't know why she won't let me help her,
 she
always did in the past.&lt;&gt;
After pounding on
 the door few more time Willow really began to get
worried.
 &lt;&gt; Maybe she fell?&lt;&gt; The witch reasoned as she got
 the master
key from her desk in the 'office'.</p>

<p>The
 young redhead almost wished that her lover had fallen because
 what
she found was far more disturbing.</p>

<p>"Buffy,
 what the Hades are you doing?" Willow yelled, when she saw
 what
her roommate was doing. "You stop that right now!" She
 realized that she
was channelling her mother, but she
 honestly did not know what to say.</p>

<p>Willow could
 plainly see the horror reflected in her beloved eyes.
 Then
confusion as she looked down at her legs. When the
 tiny slayer moved
Willow got a view of the damage she
 wished she would never have seen:
the insides of both her
 lover's thighs were criss-crossed with deep
cuts.</p>

<p>Buffy looked back up to at her, opening her mouth as
 if to say
something, and then closing it with an audible
 snap. Her blood covered
hands were holding Faith's knife.</p>

<p>Buffy dropped the knife and began crying
 uncontrollably. Willow knew she
would never forget the
 sight, Buffy was sitting on the back edge of the
small
 bathtub. Her beloveds blood was every where and Buffy had
 just
finished the last of several cuts on her inner thighs.
 When she finally
got Buffys attention Willow knew she'd
 never forget the look in Buffys
eyes. Her pain and fear
 were evident, but there was another more subtle
emotion
 just under the surface and it frightened Willow as well.
 Buffy
was aroused. Reacting on her first instinct Willow
 ran to kneel at
Buffys side.</p>

<p>"Honey why?" Willow
 asked her voice soft and full of compassion. "How
could you
 do this to your self?"</p>

<p>"I let them die." Buffy said in
 a tiny little girl voice. "I have to
feel the pain they
 felt when they died."</p>

<p>"I don't understand sweetheart
 tell me what you are talking about."
Willow insisted
 quietly but firmly. "Who did you let die?"</p>

<p>When Buffy
 couldn't seem to give her an answer Willow went ahead and
 got
Buffy out of her blood soaked clothing. She examined
 the cuts Buffy had
inflicted on herself and while they had
 bled freely they weren't serious
and with Buffys Slayer
 healing powers they would probably be mere
memories by
 tomorrow, a memory
Willow knew she wouldn't soon forget.</p>

<p>Willow tried to pry an answer from Buffy about where
 she'd gotten the
idea to hurt herself like that but all the
 Slayer could do was weep and
shrug her shoulders. In order
 to keep Buffy from withdrawing further
from her, Willow
 decided to let the subject drop for the time being.
 She
also was persuaded by Buffy to not tell Giles or her
 mother about the
incident.</p>

<p>That was possibly one of
 the worst decisions she could have made.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Hela
 had gently probed the fringes of the two girls psyches looking
 for
an exploitable weakness, carefully peeling away the
 layers of their id
until she found exactly what she was
 searching for.</p>

<p>Deep in the Slayers subconscious was a
 deep seeded guilt over the deaths
of a few innocents that
 she'd not been able prevent.</p>

<p>For some reason that Hela
 couldn't understand, the Slayer felt
responsible for the
 incidental fatalities that occurred during her war
with
 darkness.</p>

<p>After some careful manipulations of the
 youngsters subconscious Hela was
able to control Buffys
 dreams. By doing this she was able to undermine
the Slayers
 abilities and by doing that it kept her little witch
 kit
preoccupied and unable to combat Hela effectively.</p>

<p>"Soon little one." Hela said to the nude blonde female
 chained to the
Countess' throne. The broken vampire nuzzled
 Helas leg and Hela stroked
her hair smiling at the new pets
 response. "It won't be long before I
get you some new
 playmates. You'd like that wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Unable to
 speak the vampire nodded her agreement.</p>

<p>"Oh you poor
 thing," Hela said with mock sympathy "Maybe I
 shouldn't
have pulled out your tongue, but you wouldn't
 shut up and I was hungry."</p>

<p>Hela let the scrying sphere
 dissipate then took the chain holding her
pet to her chair
 and using it as a leash the Countess led her toward
 her
private quarters, the female vampire was visibly
 trembling in fear.</p>

<p>She had every reason to fear.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Willow
 was at a loss, normally when Buffy was in the grip of one of
 her
nightmares, Willow would take care of it. If research
 and/or spells
didn't work than all she had to do is use
 their spiritual link to go
into the Slayers mind and find
 whatever personal demon was tormenting
Buffy.</p>

<p>Then
 the two of them would face it together and the nightmare would
 soon
be gone for a while, usually. Sure some of them would
 return but with
her Wills to protect her Buffy never
 worried about them for long.</p>

<p>This time was different,
 research didn't help. There were no spells to
study, and
 when Willow tried to enter Buffy's dream all she saw was
 a
vague vision of the Slayer fleeing some evil mass that
 was threatening
to engulf her. When Willow tried to delve
 further into these visions
Buffys mind would close to and
 force her out. When Willow attempted to
talk to her best
 friend about them, Buffy would go into a deep
depression
 and cry hysterically.</p>

<p>All these clues led Willow to
 believe that some unknown force was
attacking the Slayer
 through her dreams.</p>

<p>She'd tried to find an answer in
 the Book of Souls, but every time she
went near the tome
 any more she found herself drawn to one of the
sections
 that she and Giles had been unable to decipher. Willow
 had
thought they had beaten it when she'd broken the symbol
 code it was
originally written in, using what she'd found
 elsewhere in the book. But
even having the letters didn't
 help because the language couldn't be
translated. No matter
 where they looked, they were unable to find an
example of
 any language even remotely like it, ancient or modern.</p>

<p>Still every time she was anywhere near, she'd find
 herself starring at
that section, like she realized she was
 doing right now, tracing each
beautifully handwritten
 letter teaching herself to pronounce each
syllable
 phonetically memorising it over and over until it was
 etched
indelibly on her mind and soul. She was beginning to
 think she was
losing her mind. Then as if that wasn't bad
 enough these new powers and
skills began appearing with out
 warning.</p>

<p>Some of her new found talents she acquired
 from the Book of Souls, once
she'd learned how to do
 something it wasn't long before she could it
almost without
 thinking, then with a little practice each power
 became
quickly stronger. For example levitation, it wasn't
 just pencils
anymore. She advanced slowly at first by
 picking up a small book but
instead of taking months to
 improve, within a week she was able to pick
up Buffy,
 Giles, even Giles' car. It was almost frightening.</p>

<p>What
 bothered her even was the ones that just appeared, it was like
 a
voice in her head would tell her how and suddenly she
 could see the aura
of magic, but last night had been really
 scary. Willow didn't know what
caused her to wake up, but
 as soon as her eyes were open she knew she
was alone again.</p>

<p>Normally when she and Buffy were asleep they held each
 other or at the
very least they were touching but, since
 the girl had died and Buffys
nightmares had begun again, it
 wasn't unusual for Willow to wake up in
the middle of the
 night to find herself alone. The first time was the
night
 she'd found her best friend and lover in the downstairs
 bathroom
cutting herself with Faiths knife.</p>

<p>The
 memory of the sight of Buffy sitting on the edge of the tub
 cutting
herself, blood splattered everywhere, and the
 horrified look on her face
when she realized what she'd
 done sprung unbidden into Willows minds
eye.</p>

<p>With
 it she felt the panic rising in her but before she could jump
 out
of bed to search for her missing lover, that voice in
 her had stopped
her.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Be calm witch and you
 will find the one you seek.&lt;&gt; the voice told
her.</p>

<p>"But I've got to find her." Willow said to the empty
 room.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Relax, all will be well.&lt;&gt; Willow
 froze for a moment confused by the
sudden intrusion.
 &lt;&gt;I am not an intrusion.&lt;&gt; the voice informed her.
 &lt;&gt;I
am a part of you.&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>It was then
 that she realised the voice had spoken to her before
 and
every time she listened something good happened.</p>

<p>"Okay self," Willow said to an empty room "Tell me, how do
 I find my
Buffy."</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Relax.&lt;&gt; the voice
 instructed. &lt;&gt;Let your mind become blank.&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>Willow sat back on the bed, she closed her eyes and began
 to take deep
calming breaths.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Concentrate
 on your beloved.&lt;&gt; it continued. &lt;&gt;Feel how much
 you love
her, how much you need her.&lt;&gt;
Willow
 filled her mind with images of her blonde Slayer. She
 recalled
how the sunlight reflected off her hair and the
 way she'd smile at her
and the look in her lovers eyes
 whenever she approached.</p>

<p>Within minutes Willow could
 feel her senses and emotions begin to reach
out, it was as
 if her all consuming love and need for Buffy came to
 life
and within seconds had reached out to every room in
 the house.</p>

<p>In a flash of insight she knew Buffy was
 downstairs in the spare room
and she could feel that Buffy
 was hurt.
Willow jumped out of bed and after grabbing the
 first aid bag and was
hurrying to her friends side to help
 in any way she could. Willow found
Buffy kneeling on the
 floor of the spare bedroom, her body covered with
bleeding
 wets and scratches as if she'd been attacked by a cat.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Willow called softly her voice trembling with
 fear for her love
"Buffy honey, come on back to bed."</p>

<p>It was spooky, Buffy just knelt there saying nothing, in
 fact not making
a sound as Willow treated her wounds. Tears
 flowed from her eyes but she
made no sound, not a gasp, not
 a sob, nothing.</p>

<p>Willow finished tending to the
 superficial wounds, then she sat cross-
legged on the floor
 facing her entranced friend. Closing her eyes the
young
 witch began reaching out with her mind to her lover. Once
 again
all she got were vague images. She felt her stomach
 turn as she came
into contact with the reddish-yellow fog
 that surrounded Buffy's dream.
The evil of that force
 sickened Willow.</p>

<p>Swallowing her revulsion Willow
 pushed her way through the fog. She
could taste and smell
 the hatred and insanity that permeated the force.
Just as
 she was about break and see the nature and source of the
 power
plaguing her friend, there was a sudden surge of
 power that expelled
Willow from Buffys mind. Before the
 witch could counter attack the evil
was gone.</p>

<p>Buffys dull glazed over eyes came back into focus then
 closed as she
fell into heap on the floor. Although she was
 sleeping naturally, Buffy
was still crying uncontrollably.
 Willow moved to her loves side and
taking the sobbing girl
 into her arms Willow began gently rocking her
whispering
 and humming softly trying to comfort and reassure
 Buffy,
telling her that everything was going to be alright.</p>

<p>She knew she was lying.</p>

<p>With that 'failure'
 weighing heavily on her mind Willow once again
returned to
 research. She searched, read, and discarded the rest of
 that
day until her head was pounding and it was impossible
 for her to keep
her eyes open. Willow pushed herself away
 from the desk, she yawned and
stretched her aching muscles
 stiffened by long hours at the computer.</p>

<p>Too exhausted
 to go home, Willow staggered across the room and
collapsed
 on to Giles' couch next to Buffys already sleeping form.</p>

<p>That night after an another uneventful patrol (four
 vamps down, goddess
knows how many more to go) the two
 girls spent nearly two hours trying
to get from the jacuzzi
 to their bed, then they both fell into a deep
exhausted
 sleep.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;WAKE UP!&lt;&gt; Willow woke up with
 that voice again this time screaming
for her to rise.
 &lt;&gt;Wake up or your beloved is lost.&lt;&gt;
That
 cleared the sleep induced fog right out of her brain. She
 first
noticed the clock, it was four A.M. and Buffy was
 gone. Using her new
found power Willow searched the house,
 but found her Buffy was nowhere
to be found. Slipping into
 her robe and slippers, Willow ran out of
their room and
 downstairs. As she searched, Willow felt a warm
 breeze
coming from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Oh goddess please
 no!" Willow moaned as she went to investigate.</p>

<p>Entering the kitchen Willows worst fears were
 realized, the back door
was standing wide open. Willow ran
 outside in a panicked frenzy, her
mind full of images of
 what could happen to her friend, out there
unaware of her
 surroundings, dressed in only a tank top and boxers,</p>

<p>"She didn't even put on her shoes." Willow said to
 herself.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't figure out which direction to
 begin looking. Finally as
a last resort she closed her eyes
 and tried to concentrate.</p>

<p>"Okay, Willow Rosenberg."
 she said under her breath. "Lets see just how
good you
 are."
Willow began to take slow deep breaths and cleared
 her mind of
everything except her overwhelming need for her
 soulmate. As the feeling
rose to the surface it almost
 became a living thing with the single
minded urge to find
 the Slayer, and reunite her with her one true love.</p>

<p>When it reached its peak Willow released it and within
 seconds it was
leading Willow at a dead run in the
 direction of the Slayer. She came
upon Buffy four blocks
 from home. She was walking barefoot down the
street,
 leaving bloody foot prints with every step.</p>

<p>Willow got
 around in front of her to try to stop her but Buffy just
 kept
walking in some kind of trance unknowing, unfeeling,
 her normally lively
flashing blue eyes dull and lifeless,
 reflecting no emotion.
Willow tried yelling at her,
 shaking her, even slapping her. But Buffy
just kept on
 walking. Going against her reluctance to use magic on
 her
helpless lover, Willow found she had no choice.</p>

<p>"STOP!" Willow commanded. Then looking deep into
 Buffy's dull eyes she
softly said, "Return to me my life,
 my love, my reason for being."</p>

<p>Buffys eyelids
 fluttered, her eyes focused. "What the..where
am...Wills?"
 Buffy stammered as she became aware of her surroundings
 "Oh
gods, not again."
With moan of complete despair
 Buffy's eyes rolled up, and she collapsed,
her mind
 shutting from the sensory overload.</p>

<p>Willow knelt down
 next to Buffy and examined her for any injuries
besides her
 feet. Finding nothing else, Willow reached down and
 gently
lovingly caressed her soulmates cheek then gently
 brushed a wayward
strand of hair from Buffys forehead.</p>

<p>"Sleep my love." Willow said softly the love she felt
 for Buffy shining
in her dark green eyes. "Your Wills is
 here, she'll take care of you."</p>

<p>Willow stood up and
 brushed herself off then looked lovingly down at
 her
sleeping lover. She quietly chanted a levitation spell,
 a soft green
glow formed around Buffy and she slowly rose
 from the ground till she
was level with Willows waist.
 Then, with a prayer of thanks to the
Goddess and hoping
 nobody would see them, Willow took her unconscious
lover
 home.</p>

<p>Once there Willow laid Buffy carefully on their
 oversized couch and
gently but thoroughly cleaned Buffys
 badly cut feet.
"My poor baby." Willow whispered
 sympathetically. "Look what's been done
to your poor feet."</p>

<p>Tears fell unnoticed from the young witches eyes as
 she removed the
shards of glass and other debris that were
 lodged in Buffys feet.</p>

<p>Once finished with that she
 carefully bandaged the Slayers feet, knowing
that they'd be
 healed by afternoon. Then she examined the rest of her
love
 to make sure there were no other physical injuries.</p>

<p>Satisfied that she'd done all she could for now and not
 wanting to wake
Buffy up, Willow carefully laid down beside
 the sleeping girl then
wrapped her arms around her troubled
 soulmate, pulled her close and very
gently reached out with
 her mind and lightly touched Buffy's sleeping
mind.</p>

<p>Finding her love to be sleeping naturally Willow
 mentally soothed Buffys
restless subconscious while she
 physically snuggled as close as she
could.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow Giles *will* give us the night off." Willow
 whispered in
Buffys ear knowing that her lover could hear
 on one level or another
"Maybe, if we can get away from all
 this for a day, we'll be able to get
a handle on all this
 and put a stop to it."</p>

<p>As Willow drifted off to sleep,
 both girls were smiling slightly as the
eerie green glow
 surrounded them, keeping them safe.</p>
