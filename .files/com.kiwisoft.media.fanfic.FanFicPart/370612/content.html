<p>Okay everyone! Here we go! Sorry about how long it took me to post this, I really wanted to get this right and its hard to write stuff like this! No, I didn't get to <b>the scene, </b>but I got pretty damn close and it will be in the next chapter for sure! I just really wanted to get something up and this was as far as I was. (Sounds familiar huh? Last chapter... :P) Hope this satisfies your cravings for now and <i><b>PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!</b></i> R&R!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Seriously, it's not mine! If it was, it would have gone a little more like this...</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>This time was different. Unlike before, when at first neither of us knew how the other person would react to the kiss, we were both completely aware of the others desires this time around. Her mouth crashed against mine, without any hint of shyness or second thoughts. The heat coursing though my body was uncontrollable and unbelievably powerful. I wrapped my arms around her neck, pressing myself against her, making sure that every inch of our bodies were touching. Her arms had snaked around my waist assisting me in my mission for closeness, I drew in a sharp breath as I felt her finger tips slid under the hem of my shirt to graze teasingly over my skin.</p>
<p>Her lips momentarily left mine, but before I could protest, I felt her press them against the base of my throat. Instantly I lifted my head to grant her easier access to that area. She moved slowly up my neck before pausing to nibble at my earlobe, sending a thrill through my body and causing me to inhale sharply.</p>
<p>"You know," She whispered, her hot breath tickling my ear, her voice low and husky from lust and desire, "I would ask if you wanted to play seven minutes in heaven, but I'm not sure seven minutes is going to be enough for me." She quickly returned her mouth to my skin, kissing and nipping at the nape of my neck.</p>
<p>"Mhhmm... not enough fo..<i>ooh...</i>" Was all I could manage in the form of a reply. I decided to show her what I meant.</p>
<p>Taking control, I lifted her lips back to mine, my tongue entering her mouth almost instantly. Walking slowly so Viola could step with me, I guided her carefully towards the wall, walking steadily forward until her back bumped lightly against the barrier that would soon be helping me encage my already helpless prey. I unlaced my arms from around her neck and pressed my hands against her shoulders keeping her tight up to the wall. Now it was my turn to leave my lovers lips and travel down to the base of her neck. Viola tilted her chin up as well, exposing the her throat. I began by creating my own love bite near her collar bone, going back and forth between nipping and licking the tender bit of skin. As much as I was enjoying the small noises coming from above, it was time to turn it up a notch.</p>
<p>With painful slowness I began to drag the tip of my tongue up her throat, flicking it away as I reached her jaw, before returning to continue my trail to her chin. I then reversed directions going from her chin down to her collar bone, but this time instead of licking I was blowing a cool stream of air over the hot saliva I had left before. I felt her shiver as a low moan escaped her lips.</p>
<p>The sound was one of pure ecstasy, and hearing it coming from the girl of my dreams who I currently had trapped between a wall and myself, peeked my longings. I needed more. Placing one hand on the wall beside her head, I slid the other one under her shirt and over her taught stomach. Marveling at her sculpted abs, I momentarily pulled away to inspect with my eyes what my fingers had discovered.</p>
<p>"Vi," I murmured, quite impressed, "Have you been working out?"</p>
<p>She shot me an alluring grin. "Maybe... Does the lady like?"</p>
<p>I giggled and nodded, "The lady certainly does."</p>
<p>A cocky grin firmly in place, she grabbed my shoulders and flipped our positions, pressing me up against the firm surface with not only her hands, but her whole body, flattening herself against me, and placing her hands on the wall at my sides. I could feel her every curve, every contour, on me. I loved the way her breast felt as they pressed against mine, our abs were perfectly alined.</p>
<p>"How do you like it now?" She whispered into my neck.</p>
<p>I tried to speak, but my words seemed to be failing me once again. The way her hip bones were resting, fitted with mine, was making it hard to think.</p>
<p>She moved to her left so she was positioned half on me, her right knee slid up the wall and pressed into my core. I gasped, my already soaked panties getting, if possible, even wetter. Her hand slid up my shirt and over my stomach, only to stop for a moment to play with the lace on my bra.</p>
<p>She giggled into my neck, "Lace, eh Liv? Some how I always knew you had a dirty side."</p>
<p>I couldn't take it much longer, my self control was about blow, and once I lost it there would be no going back.</p>
<p>"Vi" I whispered breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Hm?" She murmured, obviously distracted.</p>
<p>"Um, as much as I want this, and believe me, I <b>really</b> want this, we are kinda at a party, at someone else's house, in someone else's guest room. Don't you think we should move this to the dorms?" I stated weakly.</p>
<p>She pulled away and looked at me, her expression looked conflicted. Then she sighed and let her hand fall out of my shirt and her leg dropped away from me, giving me mild relief from my cravings.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to be so damn practical all the time?" She asked grudgingly, but gave me a small smile.</p>
<p>I smiled back apologetically, but twisted the look into an evil grin almost instantly. Hooking my arms around her neck once more I said huskily, "Well then, get me the hell back to the room baby, and then we can start the real fun."</p>
<p>When I looked into her eyes again I saw nothing but smoldering green flames. "Lets get out of here." She agreed.</p>
<p>Before I knew it we had rushed out of the guest room, our fingers intertwined, hands locked together, and found Duke and Andrew still playing spin the bottle where we had left them.</p>
<p>"Duke," said Viola breathlessly, "We need to go back to the bed... erm, <b>dorms</b><b>!</b> We need to go back to the dorms!" She blushed deeply. I just found it cute.</p>
<p>Duke looked over at us and saw the way we here holding hands and how I happened to be staring at her because of how cute her blush was, and nodded.</p>
<p>"Sure thing." He said, then turned to look at Andrew who was once again kissing that boy from before. "Hey Andrew, the girls need to leave, you ready to go?"</p>
<p>Andrew pulled away from the boy, who moved forward and frowned at the lose of contact. "Um, actually you guys," he said nervously, "I think I'm going to have to catch you later, Aaron will give me a ride back." The boy, or Aaron, as I now knew he was called, nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>"Okay then, catch you later dude." He turned to Maria and blushed deeply, he never was good at talking to girls. "Um, hey, uh, do you... um, need a ride back to the dorms?"</p>
<p>She smiled sweetly, "Actually, I would love a ride, thanks so much Duke!"</p>
<p>He grinned awkwardly and stood, offering her his hand, she took it and he pulled her to her feet.</p>
<p>Now this was all cute and everything but I was a bit more interested in the hot brunet beside me, who was currently stroking the back of my hand with her thumb and sending small shivers coursing through my body.</p>
<p>"Uh, Duke," I squeaked. "Would you mind picking up the pace?"</p>
<p>"What?" Duke replied, he was starring at Maria, "Oh, right, yeah, lets go."</p>
<p>A moment later we were all piled in his car and on our way back, Duke and Maria had struck up a friendly conversation, and I was proud of him for how well he kept it going. I would have been listening a little more closely, but I was preoccupied. Vi kept sliding her hand over to me and then brushing my leg with her fingertips, causing my eyes to roll back slightly.</p>
<p>Suddenly she moved her hand up so it was resting on my thigh, and with painful slowness started to slide it between my legs. My breath caught, my mind telling me to push her hand away, my body absolutely refusing, and instead acted of its own accord. I opened my legs a little wider, allowing her hand access to where ever it wanted to go, and it certainly seemed to know. She started to slide it up my thigh closer and closer to my center, that familiar wet feeling returned and my breathing turned a bit ragged.</p>
<p>The car suddenly hit a pot hole, jarring me out of my trance, and putting my brain back in control of my body. My hand shot down and clamped over hers, just short of its destination. I could not, however, bring myself to push her hand away, so I simply locked my fingers with hers ending her journey, but not losing the heavenly contact.</p>
<p>I shot her a sideways glance and saw that she was smiling contently to herself, the rouge.</p>
<p>The car came to a stop in front of our dorms and Viola and I were out in a flash.</p>
<p>"See you guys later." We called, not even stopping to look back.</p>
<p>We rushed up the stairs and through the double doors, down the hall and came to a screaming halt at the door to my room. Vi's hand snaked around my wrist stopping my movement instantly. She moved forward making me back up until I hit the door, her other hand that wasn't holding my wrist, wrapped around my waist and then slid down to my lower back, farther and farther until it slipped into the back pocket of my jeans. She brought her hand back around and held up my key, jingling it in front of my face and smiling slyly. I giggled and pulled my wrist out of her grasp, grabbing the key before giving her a playful shove, and turning to open the door.</p>
