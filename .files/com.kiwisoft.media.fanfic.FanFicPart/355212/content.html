<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Chasing Ghosts -->

<p>So their lives settled into a semblence of normalcy for the next two weeks. Jane, along with help from unexpected sources at the high school (who knew Bio Glass could be so helpful) had all the missing work sent to the girls in secret. It had been tricky but then Bio Glass seemed oddly suited to underhanded techniques. As far as the school board was concerned, the four girls were being home schooled at the moment. Mike, Gayle and Maria were clueless, too caught up in their own arguments with each other to notice Jane's actions. It wasn't the best arrangement for the girls, but it kept them from falling further behind in their classes. </p>
<p>Sam and Brooke spoke to Jane almost daily, getting the gossip from home and generally just staying in touch. Having the lifeline to their mother made them both calmer and more at home at Terri's despite their homesickness. According to Jane, things with Mike, Maria and Gayle hadn't improved any, but they hadn't degraded any further either. However, they could hear the strain that the situation was putting on Jane and Mike's relationship and that bothered them. Sam and Brooke agreed that despite the way Mike was acting at the moment, he made Jane happy and that was all they wanted for her. They didn't want to see that relationship fall apart because of their own relationship. But they didn't see a way to fix it at present either. </p>
<p>They had had Jane secretly pass on messages to Harrison and Carmen. Just simple 'Hello's' and 'We're fine'. General stuff and nothing that Mike could use to find them. They knew that they were taking a chance that one of them would go running to Mike to tell him that Jane knew where they were but decided it was worth the risk. They all missed their friends badly. Besides, if one of them did decide to rat them out, then they'd know who their true friends were. </p>
<p>Right now, the four of them knew that they could count on each other. It was a strange arrangement, Sam decided as she listened to the steady thump of her feet on the concrete as she jogged. Brooke had been telling the truth, she did jog every chance she got. But she didn't do it because she was a health nut. Working off the Oreos and other assorted junkfoods was just a side effect of jogging. For Sam running was a form of therapy. It gave her time alone to think and work through her issues. The pounding of her feet on the ground and the rhythm of her heart in her chest served as the soundtrack to which she solved her problems. </p>
<p>A while back before Brooke had confessed her own feelings, running was how Sam dealt with hers. She would pour her hurt, longing, and love for Brooke into her legs and push them harder and faster than they were meant to go. Sometimes she pushed herself to the point of being physically sick. But at the time, she didn't know what else to do with herself. Telling Brooke how she felt had never been an option and the silence was slowly killing her. Thankfully, that wasn't an issue anymore. </p>
<p>She could trace her habit of running back to when her father had died. The house had been full of mourners. The tears and sympathetic looks were suffocating to her and Sam just had to escape. So she'd simply opened the back door and started running. It was the first time in her life when she could remember feeling free. The wind pulled at her hair, brushed at her face and whispered in her ears. She swore that she could hear her father's voice. To Sam, running helped her work through her problems and it also brought her closer to her father. </p>
<p>So she ran down a side street near Terri's searching for a solution to her current problem. How to get Mike, Maria and Gayle to act like civilized 21st century individuals. It was a daunting task and it seemed no matter how many miles she ran or how much she listened to her father's voice on the wind, no answer was going to come to her. This was one problem too big for running to solve. But somehow, Sam thought if she just gave herself enough time and pushed herself hard enough, she'd find the ellusive answer. </p>
<p>"Sammy," Brooke's voice came from somewhere behind her. Without breaking her stride, Sam glanced over her shoulder. Brooke was quickly gaining on her from behind. The blonde's slightly longer stride brought her to Sam's side in moments. </p>
<p>"Hey," Sam said simply in greeting without stopping. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"Hey," she responded. "You've been out here a long time, love. How far are you planning on running today?" Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Until I get tired, I guess" she answered. Brooke laughed and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Took me a while to find you. Searched the entire neighborhood. Lily's been entertaining the idea that you've been kidnapped or something. She's got a very vivid imagination, that girl," Brooke explained. Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"Sammy, can we stop a sec? I didn't stretch before coming after you and I've got a catch in my side," Brooke panted. Sam slowed to a stop. She watched as Brooke caught her breath. </p>
<p>"What's up?" she asked Brooke. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Nothing really. You've just been gone a long time and I got kinda worried is all." She stared at Sam's sweat covered countanence for a minute. "What are you running from, Sammy?" Sam frowned at her. </p>
<p>"Nothing. What kind of question is that?" </p>
<p>"A concerned one," Brooke pointed out patiently. "Sam, you never jog for this long. I know you run to think out your problems. So what are you thinking about?" Sam sighed and pushed her damp bangs out of her face. </p>
<p>"This screwy mess we find ourselves in," she said as she set off walking back towards Terri's house. Brooke fell into step beside her.</p>
<p>"What about it? Find any answers 'oh wise one?" Brooke joked. Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"Unfortunately no. God, Brooke, did you ever think we'd find ourselves in such a freaking mess?" Sam asked. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"Honestly? I never thought that the 'we' in question would be you and me," she said quietly. Sam stopped walking and looked at her in silent question, a slight look of hurt on her face. Brooke arched an eyebrow and cupped Sam's face in her palm. </p>
<p>"Remember, Sam, I was so far in denial over how I felt that I couldn't even see daylight," she reminded the brunette. Sam nodded and pulled away. </p>
<p>"I remember," Sam said sardonically. She started walking again. "Now what do we do?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Damned if I know, Sammy," she sighed. She wrinkled her nose. "But for right now, you need a shower." Sam stuck out her tongue. </p>
<p>"Har har, McQueen," she said sarcastically. "I happen to think I smell Mountain Fresh." </p>
<p>"Ew, Sam. A mountain in a landfill maybe..." </p>
<p>"Hey!" Sam protested. She smiled devilishly at Brooke. "I might be persuaded to shower if I had, oh say, some company..." she teased. Brooke wagged her eyebrows and smiled back at her. </p>
<p>"Race you!" </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily lay with her head on Nicole's bare stomach, just enjoying some quiet time with her blonde lover. Nicole was gently running her hands through her hair and making her feel cherished. She wondered if Nic knew what a calming effect such a small action had on her. She started tracing small circles over Nicole's skin and heard her sigh happily. </p>
<p>"You think Brooke found Sam?" Lily asked, breaking the silence that surrounded them. </p>
<p>"Probably," Nicole answered simply. "It's not like there were many places for Spam to go." </p>
<p>"True. But she seemed upset when I saw her this morning. Upset or distracted," she amended. Nicole twirled some of Lily's hair around her fingers. </p>
<p>"Probably both. If there's one thing I know about Spam it's that her mind tends to run two steps ahead of her," Nic pointed out. </p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm worried about her though," Lily shifted to look Nicole in the eye. "I thought once she got to talk to her mother that she'd relax some but I think she's getting wound even tighter but she doesn't want anyone to know." Nicole looked down at her with a slight frown. </p>
<p>"And yet we've all noticed," she remarked. Lily nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. Even Brooke. She's worried that Sam's making herself sick trying to find a way to solve our problems all by herself. But she can't. Somehow she's taken responsibilty for the whole mess and is trying to fix it. It's not fair to her," Lily complained. Nicole sighed. </p>
<p>"No, it's not. But she's going to do it because it's who she is," she argued softly. "She cares a lot about you guys and feels the need to protect you. Give her time and she'll see that she can't fix the world simply on the strength of her will alone." Lily was quiet for a while after that and Nicole thought she'd fallen back asleep. </p>
<p>"I hear the shower running. Brooke must have found her," Lily giggled softly, startling Nicole. </p>
<p>"Well, I told you she had no where to go," she chuckled. "Lil, how are you doing?" she asked seriously. Lily moved to lay next to her.</p>
<p>"I miss home," Lily confessed honestly. Nicole wrapped her arms around Lily tightly. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she whispered to the upset Latina. </p>
<p>"Stop apologizing for what's not your fault, Niki. Please. You make ME feel guilty when you do." Nicole looked at her in confusion. </p>
<p>"How do I do that?" she wondered out loud. </p>
<p>"Niki, you took a chance and confessed your feelings for me. I could have turned away but I didn't. If I had, your mother would have never known that you were gay or in love with me. She never would have hit you," Lily's voice cracked as she spoke and tears cascaded over her cheeks as she remembered the vivid bruise on Nicole's cheek. </p>
<p>"Lily, she used to hit me anyway," Nicole whispered sadly. "Being gay had nothing to do with that." </p>
<p>"Still, she hit you because of ME. When you apologize for loving me, it reminds me of what you've lost and sacrificed to be with me. You pretend not to care but I know you do. You have a heart and emotions, Nic. And I know you hurt," Lily said to her quietly. Nicole nodded relucantly. </p>
<p>"I do, but you're more important," she said simply. Lily sniffed. </p>
<p>"Not to me," she countered. </p>
<p>"Well, we're a sorry pair, aren't we?" Nicole joked to lighten the mood. Lily sighed and then giggled slightly. </p>
<p>"You just can't stand having a sensitive moment last TOO long, can you?" Lily snickered. Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, I break out in hives. Very ugly visual." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"I hate Calculus," Sam declared as she tossed down her pencil in defeat. "I give up." Brooke looked up from her English assignment and sighed. </p>
<p>"Try again, Sammy," she said patiently. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"I've BEEN trying. It makes no sense to me. All the stuff is blending together," she whined. "I think my brain is melting." Nicole snorted. "Quiet Satan." </p>
<p>"Maybe we need a break," Lily suggested from across the table. </p>
<p>"Yeah," Nicole agreed. "We've been at this for hours." Brooke nodded as she closed her notebook. </p>
<p>"All right, any suggestions?" she asked. </p>
<p>"Movies, cards, Monopoly?" Sam rattled off. </p>
<p>"Nah," Lily broke in. "I want to get out of the house. I need some fresh air. Terri's got a beautiful, big back yard. Let's just go for a walk or something." </p>
<p>Lily and Nicole ended up down by the creek that ran through the edge of the property while Sam and Brooke stayed close to the house. They were hoping for a call from Jane who was away from Mike on a business trip. They were walking hand in hand near a flowerbed when they heard the voice call them. </p>
<p>"Sammy! Brooke!" They spun to face the unexpected voice and were shocked to see Jane standing with Terri in the driveway. </p>
<p>"Mom?" Sam gasped. She and Brooke both recovered from their shock and broke out into a run to greet their much missed mother. They engulfed her in tight hugs and didn't let go for several minutes. Lily and Nicole stood with Terri, watching with huge grins on their faces. </p>
<p>"How are you here? Why?" Brooke questioned a few minutes later. Jane smiled. </p>
<p>"There's a real estate workshop being held in downtown Austin. I begged my agency to let me go to represent them," she explained. "I told your father that I needed to get away from the situation for a little while." She looked deep into both her daughter's eyes. </p>
<p>"I missed you both so much," she said quietly. </p>
<p>"We missed you too," Sam whispered. </p>
<p>"Why don't we take this party indoors, folks," Terri broke in. She led the reunited family into the house. Jane, Sam and Brooke sat at th table. </p>
<p>"How long are you here for, Mom?" Sam asked, grinning from ear to ear. She was beyond happy to see her mother. Jane smiled back at her.</p>
<p>"A week at best, Sammy. Any longer than that and Mike will get suspicious," Jane said. Terri snickered. </p>
<p>"Please, that man is clueless," she commented. She then remembered that both Mike's daughter and fiancee were in the room and winced at her words. "Oops, sorry," she apologized sheepishly. </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it," Jane told her. "He is." She turned back to her daughters. "How are you two?" </p>
<p>"We're good, right Sammy?" Brooke asked. Sam nodded but Jane could see that the situation was putting a strain on Sam. Sometimes the girl was too sensitive for her own good. </p>
<p>"Homesick though," Sam ammended. "We miss you and our friends." Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I miss you too. And your friends miss you. Everyone has asked what's going on and whether the rumors are true. I tell them that your sexual preference, whatever it may be, doesn't effect their lives so they have to wait for you to come home to explain. I hope you don't mind but I didn't feel that it was my place to tell anyone," Jane explained quietly. Sam looked at Brooke who just shrugged back. </p>
<p>"It's OK with us, Mom. You're right, it isn't their business anyway," Sam said. "At least until we chose to tell them." </p>
<p>"So, where are you staying?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"I have a room at the hotel next to the convention center," Jane said handing Brooke the phone number to her room. </p>
<p>"You can stay here," Terri said. </p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam agreed with her eyes lighting up. Jane shook her head. </p>
<p>"I'd love to but I need to stay at the hotel in case Mike calls." Sam nodded at the logic in that. </p>
<p>"OK," Sam said a little disappointed. </p>
<p>"So," Jane said, "tell me everything I've missed." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Terri, I can't thank you enough for taking the girls in. It was above and beyond what you were obligated to do," Jane said later after the girls went to bed. Terri waved her off. </p>
<p>"My pleasure, Jane. I love my Pumpkin-nose too much to just turn her away, no matter what the reason. Mike's being an ass. Nicole and Lily are her friends so they're more than welcome. And as for your girl, Jane, well, Sam is certainly something special from what I've seen," she said. Jane smiled and nodded. </p>
<p>"I like to think so. God, I betrayed them both so badly," she complained. </p>
<p>"And yet they don't hold it against you so you shouldn't either. Don't let it eat at you, Jane. Let it go and work on fixing things. Sam's driving herself nuts trying to find a way to get everyone home," Terri explained. Jane frowned. </p>
<p>"That's my Sam, trying to change the world before she hits twenty," she sighed. Terri tilted her head as she thought of her next question. </p>
<p>"Has she always been like that? Taking things so personal and behaving like everything is her fault?" Terri asked. Jane nodded slowly.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," she said. "Sam may act tough and like she's strong but she's not. She has always taken things to heart. I think she even blamed herself for her father Joe's death." </p>
<p>"Poor kid," Terri breathed. "She's sweet though. They're all good kids. This is an unfair mess they're in." </p>
<p>"I know. And I've been racking my brain trying to find a way to clean it up, but I've come up empty." </p>
<p>"Give it time, Jane. Eventually an answer will present itself," Terri reassured her. </p>
<p>"I hope so." </p>
