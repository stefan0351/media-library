<!-- Scientific Method -- Post Script \ null -->

<p>B'Elanna Torres removed a panel from the far wall in Astrometrics and immediately thrust her hands into Voyager's glowing innards, nimble fingers deftly handling the delicate circuits now so rudely exposed. It felt good to be doing something . . . to keep busy . . . to keep her mind off the knowledge that her privacy had been violated. The events of the last few days nagged at her still; she found herself glancing over her shoulder while she worked, or turning around suddenly as she made her way to her quarters . . . only to find an empty corridor around her. It was unsettling to think that only days before an alien race had been observing them; more than that, the aliens had been using them as test subjects in an array of experiments. There was no way of knowing how long the aliens had been on board or how long they had been interfering with the thoughts and actions of the crew . . .  all for the sake of scientific curiosity.</p>

		<p>The thought made B'Elanna shudder. She didn't much like the idea of being used as a laboratory animal, but liked even less the fact that it had happened right under her nose . . . for that meant it could happen again.</p>

		<p>"Is there a malfunction, Lieutenant?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna gasped, dropping her diagnostic tools with a resounding clatter that barely masked the rabid thumping of her heart. She looked up, anxiety turning to mild annoyance as she considered the blond haired woman standing there. Seven of Nine stood ramrod straight, shoulders back . . . chest thrust forward. The Borg was dressed in a glittery brown one piece suit that accented every well rounded curve of her body. "Don't do that! You scared the hell out of me."</p>

		<p>"I am . . . sorry?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna shook her head, laughing quietly. It was only a few days ago that she'd wondered if the word "sorry" was even in the Borg vocabulary. Now it was, apparently, and this Borg in particular seemed capable of using it when the need arose. "Don't worry about it. I'll live. " She began collecting her tools, aware of Seven's gaze upon her . . . surprised at the warmth it brought to her cheeks to be under this woman's scrutinizing stare.</p>

		<p>"I was not aware of any damage to the Astrometrics lab, " Seven said.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna got to her feet, meeting Seven of Nine face to face. "No damage. You said you required more power, didn't you?" "I did, " Seven nodded. "However, you were not pleased with my attempts to increase power levels to the Astrometrics lab."</p>

		<p>"No, " B'Elanna said. She snapped her tool kit closed and leaned on the workstation beside her. "I wasn't pleased with the fact that you didn't ask first or at the very least let me know what you were planning. I just might have approved of it, you know."</p>

		<p>"I will endeavor to consult you in the future before undertaking such tasks, " Seven said.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna laughed. "Yeah . . . check with me, will you? It'll save us all a lot of time." She turned to the computer console and checked her handiwork, nodding in approval at what she had accomplished in such short order. "This is the best I can do under the circumstances."</p>

		<p>Seven looked over her shoulder, and B'Elanna smiles as the other woman's eyes went wide in genuine surprise. "You have increased the energy allotment by three percent."</p>

		<p>"Three point one, actually, " B'Elanna said. "That enough?"</p>

		<p>"It will suffice, " Seven replied.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna let the silence build then snorted up a laugh. "Well . . . you've got apologies down pat. I guess it was expecting too much to want a 'thank you' in return. Oh, well. You can't have everything, right?"</p>

		<p>"You do not like me."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna jerked her head back in surprise. The statement was cold, emotionless . . . and yet it stung like a knife through the heart, though she couldn't understand why it even mattered. "Excuse me?"</p>

		<p>"You incessantly criticize me, " Seven replied. "Your body temperature increases when I am in close proximity to you. You become impatient . . . irritable. I must therefore conclude that you do not like me."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna sighed. "Seven, I hardly know you."</p>

		<p>"Perhaps you should get to know me before rendering a judgment."</p>

		<p>"Okay, " B'Elanna said. "I'll get to know you first *then* I'll not like you. Is that all right?"</p>

		<p>"It is . . . equitable, " Seven replied.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna laughed. "Seven . . . I was kidding. You know, a joke? Surely you must have assimilated someone with sense of humor."</p>

		<p>"If so, it was quickly deemed irrelevant by the collective and dismissed, " Seven answered flatly.</p>

		<p>"Well then, " B'Elanna said. "You'll just have to find one of your own, now won't you?" She put a reassuring hand on Seven's shoulder and was caught completely off guard by the emotions the simple gesture suddenly conjured up. The feel of the other woman's solid form underneath her hands stirred something deep in her Klingon belly, a primal urge that made her palms sweat and her heart pound. The feeling surprised her . . . even frightened her a little, yet before she could process the information on an intellectual level she found herself leaning forward to kiss Seven's pouty lips, slowly . . . lazily, bringing a hand up to cup the back of Seven's head, drawing the other woman closer. She eased her tongue between hesitant lips then Seven's mouth opened wide in acceptance .  .  . or was it curiosity? B'Elanna didn't know .. . or even care. She circled Seven's tongue with her own, head spinning from the sensation. It was like grabbing a plasma conduit with her bare hands. Her entire being felt like it was engulfed in flame, the heat intense . . . so intense . . . overwhelming her with need . . . desire . . .</p>

		<p>B'Elanna tore herself away, struggling to breathe . . . struggling to make sense of the feelings raging through her. She saw the quizzical look that flickered across Seven's face and began to respond . . . but couldn't. She couldn't find the words . . . or the will to say them once she did. She grabbed her tool kit and hurried out of Astrometrics.</p>

		<p>The moment B'Elanna entered her quarters she began pacing like a caged tiger, balled fists at her side. She kissed Seven! She just couldn't believe it. How stupid! She kissed that Borg! That . . . that . . . smug . . . arrogant . . . self absorbed . . . sensuous . . . beautiful . . .  intriguing Borg.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna plopped down on the sofa and buried her face in her hands. There was no point in denying her attraction to Seven of Nine, not after having kissed the other woman's lips so thoroughly . . . so *hungrily*.</p>

		<p>Hunger.</p>

		<p>It was the only word that described the pangs of longing that were making her insides flutter. She could still taste the sweetness of Seven's lips on her owns, could still feel the softness of that silken blonde hair between her fingers. It would have been so easy to chalk the incident up to the lingering effects of an alien influence, but even as the thought emerged B'Elanna quickly squelched it. The aliens were gone; this course of action was all hers and knowing that made her shudder with anxiety.</p>

		<p>The sound of the doorchime intruded upon her thoughts like a herd of wild targ trampling a bed of roses. B'Elanna growled between bared teeth, and even as she prepared to lash out at this unwelcome visitor the doors hissed open to reveal Seven of Nine standing in the corridor.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna caught a ragged breath. Gods! The woman was gorgeous. Long legs, firm breasts, a nicely rounded backside, and eyes so deep a blue that B'Elanna just wanted to dive right in and never come up for air. B'Elanna got to her feet, hands trembling as Seven cautiously stepped in to her quarters. The two of them stood there, breathing labored, letting the silence -not entirely unpleasant- build up between them. B'Elanna swallowed hard. There was so much she wanted to say . . . even more she wanted to do, and once again the words were hard to come by and she cursed her inability to find them. She reached out, a tentative gesture, rubbing the back of her hand up and down Seven's cheek. The skin was so soft . . . so smooth . . . so warm. Seven reached out to her and mirrored the caress, stroking her cheek with the most gentle touch B'Elanna had ever known. B'Elanna made a soft sound deep in her throat, almost a purr . . . just short of a cry. The other woman's touch quickly turned her legs to rubber. She cupped Seven's face in her hands and pulled the other woman's mouth to her own, kissing Seven deeply. This time there wasn't the slightest bit of hesitation. Seven returned the kiss with equal fervor, devouring her mouth with an intensity that shook B'Elanna to her core. A darting tongue teased her own with the slightest hint of uncertainty then B'Elanna moaned her approval, and the kissed deepened more. She slid her arms around Seven's slim waist, hands searching for the firm rounds of the other woman's bottom.</p>

		<p>"Mmmmph, " Seven grunted.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna laughed between kisses. "Oh . . . like that, huh?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, " Seven whispered. "Yes . . . "</p>

		<p>"So do I, " B'Elanna muttered. She squeezed Seven's backside just a little harder, massaging the firm globes in a slow, steady rhythm. Seven moaned under her care, a sound so utterly exciting B'Elanna could barely contain the pleasure building up inside her. The need to feel Seven's naked body against her own was so powerful she felt it could crush her under its weight.</p>

		<p>She took Seven's hand -deliberately choosing the one covered with an intricate design of Borg circuitry- and led her new lover into the bedroom where they kissed again, hotly . . . passionately, hands sliding up and down one another's body in a frenzied need to feel each other. B'Elanna took a measured step back and Seven whimpered disappointedly at the broken contact, blue eyes sullen and downcast until B'Elanna slowly began to remove her uniform. Then, suddenly, those eyes were full of life, opening wide as B'Elanna slowly removed each article of clothing. Stripping under Seven's demanding stare left B'Elanna with a dripping wet crotch, the scent of her arousal permeating the air. Piece by piece, she revealed her nakedness to Seven of Nine . . . her belly, her breasts  . . . then at long last, the thick bush of hair between her legs. Seven licked her lips in greedy anticipation and started toward her. B'Elanna held her impatient lover at bay, raised eyebrows making it clear what she expected. Seven nodded in compliance.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna reclined on the bed, on her side, head propped up on one elbow while her free hand lazily twirled the hair that covered her mons as she watched Seven of Nine get undressed. Seven stepped out of her boots then unzipped her catsuit, letting it pool on the floor around her feet. B'Elanna couldn't help the gasp that escaped her lips. Looking at Seven's glistening nude body was like seeing heaven. The last remnants of Borg perversion still marred the other woman's body, but it did nothing to detract from the perfection that was Seven of Nine. B'Elanna's gaze drifted from the luscious breasts capped with light brown rings to the tuft of hair between Seven's legs, hair so blond it was almost transparent.</p>

		<p>"You approve?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>"Mmmmhmmm, " B'Elanna purred. She reached out and took Seven's hand, pulling the other woman into bed. Legs slowly intertwining, she leaned over and snatched Seven's lips in a burning kiss, groaning softly as Seven's hand first touched her hips then slid upwards to cup a breast.</p>

		<p>"*You* like *that*, " Seven whispered between kisses.</p>

		<p>"Oh . . . yeah . . . " B'Elanna mumbled. She maneuvered her knee between Seven's legs and applied just the tiniest bit of pressure, making Seven wriggle with pleasure. She could feel the other woman's wet cuntlips pressed against her flesh, and the need it created bordered on insanity. Heat crept along her body, searing her flesh, making her mind spin out of control. She was in the grips of a passion the likes of which she never dared imagine . .. and she gave in to it, willingly, letting it take her places she might otherwise have avoided. B'Elanna rolled Seven onto her back, keeping her knee tight against the other woman's cunt as she poised above her. She stared down into Seven's eyes and saw them flare with arousal. Bending down, she kissed around the crescent of metal that encircled Seven's eye, slowly working her way down the other woman's face . . . kissing her nose, her chin, her eyes, her lips . . .wanting to taste every single part of her. B'Elanna kissed her way down Seven's neck, nibbling kisses that made Seven gasp and sigh. Hands raced up and down her back, tracing the flexing muscles across her shoulders then moving further downward to take firm hold of her bottom. She shifted her weight, whimpering softly. . . pleading . . . begging . . . and Seven knew .. . knew! Fingers parted her cleft, searching for the puckered opening of her anus and teasing it.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna nearly roared with pleasure. She buried her face in crook of Seven's neck, biting, licking, nibbling and sucking the creamy skin as Seven made small circles around her anus with the tip of a long, nimble finger. Needing more, B'Elanna kissed her way down and around Seven's ample breasts. Seven made a short sound, deep in her throat and B'Elanna laughed . . . a laugh of extreme arousal. She took a nipple into her mouth and sucked it, gently at first, then more vigorously, circling it with her tongue then sucking on it again until it stiffened between her lips. B'Elanna moved from one breast to the other, lavishing them with attention, unable to get enough of Seven into her mouth to satisfy the hunger that burned deep within.</p>

		<p>"Oh . . . oh . . . *B'Elanna* . . . "</p>

		<p>Hearing her name coming from Seven's lips for the first time nearly sent B'Elanna over the edge. She kissed her way across Seven's flat tummy, inching her way down the bed until she was poised above Seven's hot, wet cunt. Seven opened her legs invitingly, knees drawn up to give B'Elanna all the room she needed. B'Elanna dropped her head into Seven's crotch, inhaling the pungent musk that was the other woman's desire. The scent went right to her head, making her dizzy. She parted the swollen red lips with her fingers and flicked her tongue against Seven's clit. Seven jerked spasmodically, hips rising to meet B'Elanna's hungry mouth. B'Elanna draped an arm across Seven's belly, steadying her need lover for the oncoming attack. B'Elanna swirled her tongue between the unfurled cuntlips in front of her, licking up and down the length of Seven's slit then diving in again. Each stroke dragged a whimper across Seven's other lips and B'Elanna relished it, quickly burying her face in the other woman's cunt. The taste was sweet, peppered with some exotic spice that B'Elanna just couldn't enough of. She licked and sucked everything in front of her, taking Seven in gluttonous mouthfuls. Seven writhed on the bed, legs resting atop B'Elanna's shoulders. B'Elanna pushed in deeper, tongue questing . . . probing . .. searching for that one spot that would drive Seven wild .  . . and when Seven squealed helplessly B'Elanna knew she'd found it.</p>

		<p>"Yes!" Seven cried. "B'Elanna . . . oh . . . oh . . . please . . . "</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was relentless, unmerciful and insatiable. She flicked her tongue inside Seven's cunt with an almost reckless abandon, using well placed fingers to apply constant pressure against Seven's clit. Seven thrummed on the bed, body twitching violently. B'Elanna slurped Seven's clit between her lips and began sucking on it like it was a piece of candy. Seven exploded in orgasm, crying out in anguished need. B'Elanna lapped up every last drop of sweetness that oozed form between Seven's legs, bringing Seven to a second climax in only a few moments. Even then she refused to let up, stopping only when Seven went limp in her arms. She kissed her way along Seven's sweaty body, dropping a kiss on the Seven's belly . . . breast . . . lips . . . she kissed those lips for the longest time before sliding up beside her lover.</p>

		<p>Seven turned to a look at her, a smile playing across the lips she'd just kissed. B'Elanna returned the smile, eyes fluttering back in her head as Seven reached down to cup her mons.</p>

		<p>"Seven . . . "</p>

		<p>"Is that good?"</p>

		<p>"The best . . . " B'Elanna muttered. "Now go inside . . . please . . . " Fingers pushed into her, making her gasp. She wiggled to lay flat against the mattress, her eyes never leaving Seven's as the other woman thrust in and out of her with what felt like two fingers . . . then three. Gods! She pulled Seven close and kissed those delicious lips. Seven's hand never strayed. B'Elanna bucked against the fingers pumping in and out of her cunt, needing release. Seven responded to her need, quickening the pace, pummeling her clit with the flat of an eager thumb. The lips B'Elanna so enjoyed kissing moved to her breasts, one then the other, then down . . . down . . . making her whimper with each press of those lips against her skin. Seven never stopped fucking her with those delightful fingers. The kisses moved down further still, around her navel . . . across her belly . . . along her thing. Seven continued to thrust in and out of her. Now Seven was kissing her inner thigh. . . was she teasing? Gods! Those glorious fingers never stopped moving inside her! Kisses moved across her thigh . . . so close now . . . she could feel the heat of Seven's breath against her clit . . . then another finger was inside her and lips were closing around her clit, sucking her off while fingers danced between her cuntlips. B'Elanna felt the pressure mounting in her loins and could no longer contain it, letting loose a screeching wail as her pleasure bubbled to the surface in a surge so massive it left her gasping for air in its wake.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was dimly aware of the damp flesh pressed against her own and looked down to see Seven curled up beside her. The blond haired woman cocked her head slightly, one eyebrow raised.</p>

		<p>"I was in error, " Seven said. "You *do* like me."</p>

		<p>"Yes I do, " B'Elanna smiled. She stared down into Seven's eyes, searching .. . questing . . . wondering about the woman she had taken to bed.</p>

		<p>"Is something wrong?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>"I . . . I'm really starting to fall for you Seven, " B'Elanna began somberly. "Now I'm wondering . . . is it possible for you to love me in return?"</p>

		<p>Seven consider that a moment then rested a weary head on her shoulder. "I think I already do."</p>
