<p><b>Update number two. It is to be known that if I update all 8 of my Liley fics before Christmas, Satan's Camaro is to update 8 of hers too. THIS DEAL IS NOW PUBLIC, SUCKER.</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>The last thing I heard was Lilly's agonised howl as I threw myself in daddy's shooting range. He'd reloaded the shotgun, ready to silence Lilly permanently, but the moment I stared down the barrel of his rifle, he lowered it immediately.</p>
<p>"Daddy, you don't understand! She saved me from another wolf!" I cried, staring pleadingly at daddy's stern face. All was suddenly deathly quiet behind me and I hoped with all that I had that the shot wasn't fatal. The state Lilly had arrived in was awful enough and to survive through another mauling and even a gunshot would be miraculous in itself. Daddy's expression became confused.</p>
<p>"Where'd the other one go?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It ran off before you got here. But, Lilly..." I finally turned around to check on her, preparing myself for the worst. If she was dead, I would die too. If she survived, I would rejoice and swear my never-ending loyalty and friendship to her. Though, that hardly made up for my neglect.</p>
<p>Once I was facing the area the battle had taken place, all that remained was a puddle of blood where Lilly had previously lain. "She's gone," I whispered. I whizzed around, pushing past daddy and followed the drops of blood Lilly had left as my guide all the way to the barns exit. I was floored. Lilly managed to sneak around daddy and I without even a sound, which just couldn't be possible considering the multiple wounds she was surely covered in. That girl was utterly surreal.</p>
<p>"Now, wait a second, darlin'. You can't just run off in the dark to find a wild animal. Anythin' could be in them woods," Daddy warned, grasping my shoulder to keep me planted to the ground.</p>
<p>"But... She might die," I protested hoarsely.</p>
<p>"You'll have to wait until morning to find out, bud." I knew daddy wouldn't relent on the matter, but I wouldn't know what to do with myself if Lilly died after saving my life. I had no idea what she was going through or what demons she faced when I rejected her for being something she had no control over. I turned her away. I was a disgrace to everything I ever stood for. I believed in respecting differences and always had a strong disdain for intolerant people who refused to even attempt to understand them. I reacted like one of them. I was disgusted with myself.</p>
<p>Daddy draped a large arm over my shoulders and led me out of the barn. I decided then that I would tell him everything about Lilly, well, minus the whole werewolf thing. I would only tell him about the encounters I had with 'Princess' and maybe he wouldn't be mad. Maybe he'd be perfectly fine with it and let me continue looking after Lilly, while protecting her secret, and maybe things would be okay.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I awoke with the dawn the next day with a powerful determination coursing through me. My sleep was fitful and my fleeting dreams were frightening and disturbing. They plunged me deeper into the abyss of despair I had created for myself and I didn't falter as I sprung out of bed, grabbed my coat and hurried down the hall, the stairs, out of the house, almost forgetting to slip on my boots. I needed to find Lilly. I needed to know she was still alive so I could make things right again.</p>
<p>I mounted daddy's horse, aware that Lilly was already at risk of predation, considering all the blood she'd undoubtedly shed last night, and I made haste, examining the ground with precision as Buck whinnied, unsettled by the unfamiliarity of being ridden by me. I kicked my heels firmly into his sides, not appreciating his hesitation. There was absolutely no time to lose. If there was even any time left at all.</p>
<p>He huffed and obeyed my mute command. I was slowly losing sight of the dots of blood hiding in the grass as we trotted closer to the forest's opening. I urged Buck to accelerate and he did so with only slight reluctance this time, his brown head tossing from side to side every so often. However, the trees became denser and I was forced to pull the reins back so Buck slowed to a fast, but careful, walk as I scanned the trees.</p>
<p>I located a trunk painted scarlet, knowing Lilly had most likely leant there to recuperate for a moment. The grim sight made me sick and as I travelled a route that was becoming obvious to me, I no longer relied on the blood trails to lead me and kicked Buck into a brisker pace. There was a strange smell in the air, bordering on decay, and my panic increased. Maybe I really was too late.</p>
<p>Tears tampered with my vision, but I closed my eyes to hold them back. I hadn't seen it yet. I hadn't seen Lilly's dead body, so I couldn't believe she was gone until I was witness to her corpse. I inhaled weakly, the stench growing more revolting and Buck shook his head with a grunt, also affected by it. I held my breath as I parted a few branches with my hands, finally finding what I had sought.</p>
<p>I dismounted Buck and raced to Lilly's side. She was human. She was naked. She was motionless. She was dirty. She reeked. But, most noticeably, she was alive. I could have wept with glee just knowing I still had the opportunity to apologise and to tell her I still wanted her in my life, no matter what she was.</p>
<p>I shrugged out of my coat and used it to cover her bare form as I weighed my options. If I left her to retrieve some medical supplies, she might flee, or worse, bleed to death. I glanced down, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks as I abashedly removed my coat to check for any open wounds. I rolled her over onto her back and grazed my fingers down her smooth stomach, not encountering any wet blood. I also kept an eye out for where the bullet had struck her, but it would be impossible to find until she was cleaned up.</p>
<p>I sighed and shook Lilly's shoulder gently, but she only stirred a little. I whispered her name and that seemed to snap her into consciousness instantly. Her sky coloured eyes opened and peered at me with astonishment, as if she were torn between being happy I was here, or being terrified. I smiled, hoping to ease her worry.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Lilly. I only wanna help you. Will you still be here if I go back to my house and get my first aid kit?" She didn't reply straight away, and I noticed the haze in her eyes. They were troubled and I wondered how much pain she was blocking, how much mental trauma she was suppressing and how much of it was my fault. I stroked away some hair that clung to her jaw with a tenderness that only Lilly deserved and a small glimmer of awareness restored itself within her gaze. She smiled a dim smile and nodded in response to my question.</p>
<p>"It's not like I could go anywhere," she said, her desolate tone wreaking havoc on my already damaged heart. I couldn't handle looking at her anymore, feeling ashamed enough already. I stood, leaving her with nothing but my coat to protect her and quickly climbed onto Buck, directing him back through the sea of trees and to the house.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Lilly ~</p>
<p>Not even in my wildest dreams did I expect to wake up from a foul unconsciousness to find Miley leaning over me. Her hair was a mess – a beautiful mess – and her eyes looked truly concerned. <i>Concerned </i>for<i> me. </i>I thought she would be the first to hunt me down, but, astoundingly, she appeared above me with no weapon apart from her smile. Then she touched me so softly, with such caring hands harbouring no ill intentions that I thought perhaps I was in heaven. She was going to look after me and when she left, I believed she wasn't going to come back to help treat my wounds, but she did. She burst through the trees like she was born to be my saviour and went straight to work. Cleaning me, nurturing me, handling me so delicately I could have cried.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for how I reacted, Lilly. I should have just asked for some space, not freaked out the way I did," she said as she wrapped some gauze around my thigh. My duffel bag was still stored safely behind a rock by the lake, but it was damp from the light rain that sometimes fell. Miley had rummaged through it and produced some shorts and a top for me to wear after she'd, to my horror, almost wiped down every inch of me with a wet cloth she'd dipped in the lake. I intervened, however, and took the liberty to clean the parts of me I didn't want Miley anywhere near as she prepared the numerous disinfectants and bandages she'd brought.</p>
<p>Miley's features were overcome by a deep concentration as she applied the ointment with great care, but I still winced when she brushed some of the bigger gashes.</p>
<p>"Uh, Lilly... The bullet...?" Miley timidly met my eyes and I could see the sorrow she felt because of her father's actions.</p>
<p>"It only grazed me," I replied, glad to see the instant relief I'd just provided. "I heal pretty fast, so I'm guessing I'll be fine after about a week."</p>
<p>"Well, would you be able to change? I talked to daddy and he said if I found you, I could bring you home and look after you, as long as I reminded myself that wolves shouldn't be kept as pets." She chuckled and the fact that she accepted me, in either form, caused me to feel an overwhelming amount of adoration for her.</p>
<p>"I think by tomorrow I'll be able to walk again. Is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Of course it is. The weather broadcasts are promisin' it's gonna be stormin' all week and I'd rest easier knowing you were safe in my home," she said, wrapping a sheet of gauze around my ankle. She then moved to sit closer to my head and I watched, noticing her evident puzzlement mingled with a twist of anguish as she rubbed the cold disinfectant on a laceration marking my arm.</p>
<p>"Miley?" I ventured quietly, taking her attention away from her thoughts. She looked at me with a wet gaze and I reached for her hand even though moving hurt like hell. Our fingers touched and she didn't recoil. "What's wrong? Is it Blue Jeans?"</p>
<p>"No, Lilly. He's recoverin', it's just... I'm at a loss."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I don't understand what made you come back to save me. After how I treated you, I was surprised you didn't join that other wolf and try to kill me," she growled bitterly.</p>
<p>"Oliver's a vile creature, Miley. He turned me and ruined my life. I wasn't going to let him ruin yours too," I said heatedly, never wanting to imagine what Miley would do if she became what I was.</p>
<p>"But <i>why</i>? I sent you away, I hurt you, I told you I hated you. What possible reason could you have for coming back?" She asked desperately, her usually throaty voice becoming a pitch higher as she pleaded for answers.</p>
<p>I shook my head over Miley's naivety. She was blind to the obvious. From the moment I met her, I knew there was a unique mind hiding behind her kind smile and friendly welcome. She proved to be different from the rest in the very beginning and the bond that was eventually conjured locked her in a special place in my heart that could never be escaped. I reached up with my free hand and touched the collar that still hung loosely around my neck, fingering the studded protrusion of the name Miley had given me with a sense of spreading devotion.</p>
<p>"I came back because you're my friend."</p>
