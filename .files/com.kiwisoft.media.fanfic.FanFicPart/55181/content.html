<!-- What the Heart Wants \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>Seven approached the holodeck dressed in her tight fitting velocity suit.  The captain had called to cancel their scheduled match but Seven had decided that she could use the allotted time to practice her skills.  She was somewhat surprised to find a program already running on holodeck 2.  She was about to summarily end the program that was currently interfering with her personal time, but remembering the Doctor's lessons on proper etiquette she restrained herself and instead inquired of the computer who was currently occupying holodeck 2.</p>
<p>"Holodeck 2 is currently empty" came the dispassionate female voice of the ship's computer.</p>
<p>Seven shrugged, idly wondering who could have forgotten to close down their program.  An obvious waste of ships resources.</p>
<p>Curiosity got the better of the statuesque drone and instead of shutting down the program she entered the holodeck.  She was immediately transported into a lush tropical rainforest.  In the distance she could hear running water&#133;perhaps a waterfall.  She was once again about to terminate the holoprogram in favour of her own when she decided to further explore this tropical paradise.</p>
<p>She wandered through the primeval forest her feet unconsciously taking her toward the sound of falling water.  As she came to the clearing she was shocked to see someone sitting under the gently falling water.  Assuming it was a holocharater she took a few steps further into the clearing, stopping as she realized the figure was that of Voyager's chief engineer B'Elanna Torres.  Unsure of what to do she began to back into the bushes, freezing again as she heard the sobs of the young Klingon even above the sound of the misty waterfall.  </p>
<p>Seven realized that she should leave the holodeck, even though protocol told her that it was the Engineer who was intruding and not the other way around.  </p>
<p>"Who is that?"  Came the choked sound of the Lieutenant's voice.</p>
<p>"Umm.. I'm sorry Lieutenant I didn't realize you&#133;I mean the computer said the holodeck was empty.</p>
<p>"Oh&#133;I must have left my communicator in my room&#133;I guess I lost track of time&#133;I'll get out of here now" said the obviously distraught young engineer. 'Kahless help me,' thought B'Elanna, 'of all of the people to find me like this it would have to be Miss Perfect herself.'</p>
<p>"NO&#133;I mean&#133;are you all right Lieutenant," stammered the former Borg as she stepped forward into the clearing.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was wearing Khaki shorts and a black tank top and all of her clothing was soaked and stuck to her skin as she sat on a ledge under the misting water, her legs drawn up tight to her chest, held there by her muscular arms.  Her head was resting on her knees&#133; all in all she was the picture of utter dejection.  </p>
<p>For some reason this affected Seven although she was unsure as to why.  She and the Lieutenant had never gotten along.  Seven found the fiery engineer's temper altogether too violent leading to many arguments which, in Seven's opinion, detracted from the overall efficiency of the ship.  </p>
<p>Yet seeing her like this bothered Seven as she realized that in the past few months that temper had been less and less in evidence&#133;in fact B'Elanna had been so subdued as to be almost invisible in the senior staff meetings and engineering lately.  Come to think of it&#133; perhaps it was the lack of temper and fighting that led to the recent decrease in engineering's overall efficiency of late.  Indeed the half-Klingon had not been herself for some time now and Seven decided that in the interest of her new collective she would put aside her personal feelings and help the Lieutenant recover her usual demeanor.  </p>
<p>In two long strides Seven was beside the lieutenant under the water&#133;. mimicking B'Elanna she sat cross-legged and allowed the cool water to cascade over her body.</p>
<p>"I, ahh, I wish to know what is troubling you Lieutenant" queried Seven as she braced herself for the smaller woman's acerbic retort.</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't even bother to raise her head from her knees&#133;she merely turned it to face the former drone and sighed.  "Look, I appreciate the offer&#133;but I don't think talking to you is going to help me out any if you know what I mean."</p>
<p>"No, I do not know what you mean."</p>
<p>B'Elanna sighed heavily, as her tears continued to fall.  "It's got to do with Tom and I&#133;. I just don't think this is really your area Seven."</p>
<p>"You have finally terminated your relationship with Lieutenant Paris," stated Seven calmly.</p>
<p>"What&#133;NO&#133;. HE finally dumped me."</p>
<p>"Why would he wish to do such a thing."</p>
<p>"Are you kidding me Seven&#133;he's&#133;well&#133;he's Tom Paris&#133;. One of the most popular guys on the ship&#133;and I'm&#133;well&#133;. I'm just a half-breed who nobody really likes," sobbed B'Elanna.  "He finally admitted that he was only with me for kicks&#133;you know the thrill of the forbidden.  He liked that he could be as rough and unfeeling as wanted with me but when it came to real emotion and real love he just went elsewhere.  He's never been faithful to me.  Not since the day we met.  He was just slumming and now that he is tired of it he just cut me loose."</p>
<p>Seven was completely taken aback by the torrent of emotion she had just witnessed and she was also very confused.</p>
<p>"But you are the far superior officer Lieutenant Torres," was all she could think of to say.</p>
<p>B'Elanna just closed her eyes and turned her forehead back down on her knees.  Her voice, when she spoke again, was muffled and rough with emotion.  "It has nothing to do with military prowess. It has to do with being human&#133;or not in my case.  Hell, even my own father couldn't stand me&#133;. He left when I was only five.  I heard him telling my Uncle that he just couldn't stand living with two Klingon's any longer&#133;that it was a mistake to marry my mother at all."</p>
<p>B'Elanna cried silently and Seven, noticing her shaking, moved closer and put her arm around the sobbing Klingon.</p>
<p>"My mother couldn't stand that I wasn't more of a Klingon and my father left because I wasn't more human&#133;I should have known that a guy like Tom could never really have feelings for me."</p>
<p>Seven bit her tongue thinking that now was not the time to reveal her low opinion of Tom Paris to the emotional woman she was now holding in her arms&#133;. One thing did bother her though and she couldn't seem to stop herself from asking the question.</p>
<p>"If you know what it is like to be unable to fit into any world why is it that you hate me so much."</p>
<p>B'Elanna's only answer was to cry even louder&#133;her entire body was wracked with the sobs.</p>
<p>Seven was becoming alarmed&#133;afraid that the young Lieutenant was going to do herself harm.  So she did the only thing she could think to do and shut down the holodeck and initiated a site to site transport of the two of them to B'Elanna's quarters.</p>
<p>As they materialized on the living room floor of B'Elanna's quarters Seven began to wonder if she had made a mistake&#133;. Perhaps she was not the right person to be dealing with this particular situation.  "B'Elanna would you prefer to go to sickbay?"</p>
<p>"NO&#133;Kahless&#133;no&#133;. Please I understand if you don't want to stay but please don't tell anyone about this&#133;please&#133;promise me this is just between us," B'Elanna begged.</p>
<p>Seven acquiesced to B'Elanna's request and then stood up, offering the still-sobbing engineer her hand.  She led B'Elanna to the couch and sat down beside her and placed her arm once more around the Klingon's shoulders.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't take it anymore.  It no longer mattered that this was the one person on this ship whom she had treated badly on a regular basis&#133;it no longer mattered that the hand caressing her shoulder was clad in Borg metallic implants&#133;it only mattered that there was a living breathing&#133;human&#133;of course Seven was human&#133;holding her.  B'Elanna simply dropped her head onto Seven's shoulder and pressed herself into the former drone's side taking all of the comfort Seven was able to give.</p>
<p>While B'Elanna had no idea of how long she allowed herself to be held by the young Astrometrics Officer, Seven knew it was 37 minutes 34 seconds before B'Elanna finally stirred in her arms and sat upright on the couch.</p>
<p>"I don't know about you but I could use a drink."</p>
<p>"I do not require any refreshment at this time," came the stilted reply.  Several weeks ago Seven knew that this answer would have elicited a sharp remark on the nature of the Borg, but today B'Elanna merely nodded and shuffled to the replicator to ask for a glass of something called Scotch Rocks.</p>
<p>When B'Elanna came back to the couch she sat at a distance from Seven&#133;seeming uncomfortable&#133;with nothing to say now that the storm of tears had passed.</p>
<p>Seven shifted uncomfortably and finally forced herself to say,  "would you like to discuss this further Lieutenant."</p>
<p>"The truth is I'm not even sure that I know what the problem is."</p>
<p>"I wish to understand why you feel someone like Tom Paris is the 'most popular guy on the ship' I believe you said.  He is a small-minded childish boy who is only interested in his own pleasure no matter who that hurts.  His only redeeming quality is his ability to pilot this ship."</p>
<p>B'Elanna finally smiled "I see you know him" she sniffed.  "I know he is all of those things its just that people seem to like him&#133;they find him nonthreatening and when I was with him I guess that's how I felt they saw me as well.  I was so tired of being alone and lonely that I was willing to make myself believe his lies to me about love in the beginning.  It was so nice to walk into the messhall and have someone to sit with, and as long as I was with him I felt as though I was more a part of things on the ship&#133;. You know Tom, always the life of the party.  I guess I thought it would be enough just to sort of bask in the reflected glow of all of that.  The problem is I gave up my honour and allowed him to treat me like dirt until I really started to believe that a filthy half-breed Klingon like myself was lucky to have a great guy like him even deign to touch me at all."</p>
<p>"He actually said those things to you," Seven snapped?</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked up and saw that Seven was truly angry.  It was the first real emotion B'Elanna could remember the drone evincing and it shocked her to see it displayed on her behalf.</p>
<p>"Of course&#133;all the time."</p>
<p>"That P'Taq! Assimilation is too good for him," said Seven as she got to her feet and prepared to go in search of the P'Taq in question</p>
<p>"Seven," B'Elanna actually laughed, "when did you learn to curse in Klingon?"  </p>
<p>"I did some research, I thought it might come in handy the next time we had a disagreement in engineering," Seven said shyly and she turned back toward the door.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe her ears&#133;the Borg Ice Queen actually made a joke.</p>
<p>"Seven hold on&#133;don't go&#133;he isn't the first person to tell me those things and he won't be the last&#133;its just a fact of life&#133;but I guess you know a little something about that don't you?"</p>
<p>Seven stopped and looked B'Elanna straight in the eye and intoned  "yes I do."</p>
<p>"Seven&#133;look" B'Elanna screwed up all her courage and decided that now was as good a time as any to try to restore some of her lost honour.  Brown eyes sought blue as the fiery Klingon began her confession.  "I need to apologize to you for my behaviour ever since you came aboard.  I've been cruel and unfair.  I never gave you a chance, hell I never gave myself a chance to get to know you at all.  I just jumped right in and treated you like Targ shit, and I'm truly sorry."</p>
<p>Seven was about to accept the heartfelt apology but something stopped her.  She still needed an answer to the question she asked on the Holodeck. "Knowing how it feels to be so ostracized, I still wish to know why you hate me so much.  Is being half Borg so much worse than being half Klingon&#133;perhaps you blame me for the countless assimilations in which I participated." Seven's eyes began to well with tears as she voiced out loud her own personal shame.  "I assure you nothing you could do or say to me would be worse than the things I have thought about myself since I was freed from the collective."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was the one now to wrap her arms around the ex-drone as the tears began to spill down both of their cheeks.  'OK Torres' she thought to herself 'you want your honour back now is when it starts to get tough.'  She only hoped that the fragile beginnings of a truce between them would stand the truth of what she was about to admit.</p>
<p>"I never hated you because you were Borg&#133;in fact I never hated you at all&#133;I just convinced myself of that because it was easier to admit to than the truth.  The fact is that I was jealous of you from the moment you came on board the ship. You were as good an engineer as I was, not to mention your abilities in Astrometrics&#133;. I didn't feel good enough anymore I suppose.  Being the best at my job was the one thing I could always hold onto until you came aboard. More than that though, Captain Janeway used to take an interest in me&#133;have dinner with me from time to time and talk to me as if I were a friend.  That all stopped when you came on board&#133;all she was interested in was you&#133;helping you to regain your humanity.  Then you started to make friends on board&#133;something I've never been able to do&#133;Neelix, Naomi and Sam Wildman, even the Doctor.  I couldn't stand that a Borg drone was able to develop relationships where I couldn't&#133;I suppose that's part of the reason I got involved with Tom in the first place.  At least then I could convince myself that I had someone."</p>
<p>Seven stood still but B'Elanna could see that she was trembling.  Her eyes became cold, she backed out of B'Elanna's arms and looked at her as if she were seeing something less than human.  "How could you treat me that way knowing from personal experience how difficult it is to 'fit in.' "  Your lack of honour does not excuse your behaviour, in fact it makes it worse. You hurt me for no other reason than petty jealousy. I had thought perhaps there was a chance for understanding between us&#133;perhaps even friendship but I can see now I was wrong."</p>
<p>Seven turned on her heel and left B'Elanna's quarters without so much as a backward glance.</p>
<p>She practically ran to Cargo Bay 2 and collapsed on the dais in front of her alcove.  She began to weep again for all that she had lost in life&#133;her family, her childhood, and her innocence.  Hearing the Lieutenant confess to such hurtful and petty feelings tonight seemed to reopen old wounds and remind her again that she would never truly be accepted onboard Voyager or anywhere for that matter.  It was too much for Seven to take in and so she programmed an extra long regeneration cycle and stepped into her alcove.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stood in the centre of her quarters shocked at the vehemence of Seven's reaction to her confession.  She wiped the tears from her eyes and ordered another Scotch from the replicator.  Carrying her drink to her couch she sat down and thought about everything that had transpired this evening.  She knew she had to find a way to try to make up for her hurtful behaviour toward Seven.  Perhaps then they could both find a way to feel more at home in the world.</p>
<p>Seven awoke from her regeneration cycle and was immediately assaulted by the memories of yesterday.  She felt her anger and indignation rising again and worse yet the threat of more tears.  How could someone with whom she seemed to have so much in common hurt her so callously over petty jealousy?  Seven left the Cargo bay and arrived at the messhall only to regret her decision to come to breakfast early as she saw the object of her ire sitting alone in a corner of the mess.  Seven retrieved her usual nutritional supplement and made sure to sit as far away from the Lieutenant as she possibly could.  She couldn't stop herself however from positioning herself in such a manner as to be able to observe the young Klingon.  B'Elanna looked as if she hadn't slept all night&#133;there were dark circles under her eyes and her hair was disheveled and matted down.  Seven had never seen her look quite this way before.  </p>
<p>Seven tried to hang on to her anger but the diminutive Klingon looked so sad it was getting harder and harder to keep that diamond edge to her anger.   The Lieutenant had behaved badly but she had also had the courage and honour to confess to every terrible thought and feeling.  Seven's mind ran back unbidden to the day in engineering when her cortical node had been failing.  B'Elanna had been kind and caring&#133;helping to hide her and helping her to see that there had been meaning in her life. </p>
<p>In a small secret part of her that she hated to admit existed, Seven realized that perhaps her own jealousy had also contributed to the legendary fights between herself and the engineer.  She was jealous of the half-Klingon's intelligence, emotions and strength, and she had let the same pettiness she so hated in B'Elanna poison any chance they may have had at an amicable working relationship.  Understanding the kind of life that B'Elanna had led, and seeing the pain she was feeling now, suddenly Seven let go of her anger, let it flow out her like water.  She still wasn't ready to speak to the young engineer though so she finished her breakfast and left the messhall.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked up in time to see Seven leaving the room and sighed, feeling that any chance she had of a friendship with the younger woman was gone. Well, at least, as ever, she had her work to fall back on.  Thanks to her early start she could finish up some paperwork she had been ignoring for weeks before the morning senior staff meeting.  She quickly finished eating, recycled her plates, and headed to engineering.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna," came the captain's voice over the Comm, "will you be gracing us with your presence this morning at the meeting or not."</p>
<p>"ARGGG, sorry captain I'm on my way."  B'Elanna threw down the PADD she had been working on and ran for the exit.  Several heads turned in her direction as she ran.  She jumped into the turbo lift and ordered it to deck 2.  She couldn't believe it.  Here she had finally decided to get her head back into the job and be the Chief she once was and she had already blown it.  She had been so engrossed in the formulas she had been working on to improve the efficiency of the dilithium mixture in the Warp core that she had lost track of time and now had embarrassed herself in front of the Captain and the entire senior staff.</p>
<p>She raced down the hall and through the doors to the conference room and took the first available seat.  Realizing only after she sat that she was directly across from the haughty features of Seven of Nine.</p>
<p>'Great,' she agonized to herself,  'I am not going to catch a break today.'  Out loud she apologized again to the captain and the staff for her behaviour.  </p>
<p>The Captain gave an indulgent smile that was in contrast to the harshness of her voice when she had called B'Elanna earlier.  She was aware that B'Elanna was going through some tough times and was inclined to cut her Chief Engineer some slack.  It helped that the computer had informed her that B'Elanna had been working in Engineering for several hours already that morning.  Janeway sincerely hoped that the troubled young woman was putting the worst behind her and getting back to her old self again.</p>
<p>As the Captain began the meeting B'Elanna snuck a quick look over at Seven of Nine only to find that the former drone was staring at her.  She blushed and looked away but not before she saw Seven raise her ocular implant in speculation.  </p>
<p>When it came time for B'Elanna to give her departmental report she spoke of the plan she had for improving the efficiency of the warp core.  This was the first time in months that she had come up with a project of her own and was desperately hoping for a good reception.  She knew it wasn't the most original plan but felt that if she could get it to work they would be able to stop looking for dilithium so frequently and could possibly shave some time off their trip home.</p>
<p>Her hopes were dashed when Tom snorted from the other end of the table.  "Oh come on B'Elanna&#133;this again.  Didn't you improve the warp core last month," he sneered.  "Why don't you do some real work for a change.  I've asked a dozen times for improvements to the speed and handling of the Delta Flyer and you always put it off.  Its about time you paid some attention to big picture around here."</p>
<p>The Captain leveled her best force 10 glare at the impudent young helmsman and was about to reprimand him for his behaviour when a voice from the other end of the table spoke up.</p>
<p>All heads snapped around in shock as Seven of Nine spoke up in B'Elanna's defense.  "I hardly think that the extension of your ego qualifies as the 'big picture' for Voyager.  B'Elanna has a plan that will shorten the timespan required to get Voyager home and if you could see past your overinflated sense of self you might realize that for a change."</p>
<p>Silence reigned in the conference room as even Janeway was at a loss after hearing Seven defend her biggest adversary.  </p>
<p>Finally Harry spoke up, ever the peacemaker, and added his support of B'Elanna's plan to the mix.  He even offered to help out after hours if it was needed.</p>
<p>The Captain nodded gratefully and the rest of the meeting went much more smoothly.</p>
<p>As the senior staff was filing out of the room Tom brushed by both B'Elanna and Seven as they were heading for the door.  </p>
<p>"At least the Borg can still take pity on you huh Lanna," he sneered. </p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't think of anything to say and wasn't sure she would have been able to speak over the lump in her throat anyway.</p>
<p>As he passed Seven he muttered "Borg bitch" under his breath realizing that of all the crewmembers on this ship only B'Elanna and Seven would be able hear his comment with their advanced hearing abilities.</p>
<p>Seven ignored him and turned on her heel to head to Astrometrics.  She had work to do.</p>
<p>Down in Engineering B'Elanna got right to work on her formulas, working steadily for over an hour until she heard voices being raised out in main engineering and saw the lights flicker right before the ship dropped out of Warp.</p>
<p>"Here we go again" she murmured darkly.</p>
<p>"Looks like some gelpacks failed in Jefferies Tube 56," said Vorik as she walked out onto the floor.</p>
<p>"I'll take care of it," B'Elanna said, "my eyes need a break from staring at my terminal anyway."</p>
<p>Vorik nodded and helped her gather up the tools she would need.  Glad to see that at last his Chief seemed to be taking an interest in the ship again.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had removed the panel to the access hatch and was about to crawl in when she heard a voice behind her that froze her in place.</p>
<p>"I believe you will require assistance with this task Lieutenant Torres.  I am running a long-range scan that will not require my presence for several hours.  I will help you repair the malfunction."</p>
<p>"Seven&#133;umm&#133;you really don't need to help.  I can manage."</p>
<p>"It is a more efficient use of resources if we work together."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was about to argue when she realized that she really didn't want to.  Fact was she would be glad of the company and she was happy that Seven was at least willing to relate to her on a professional level.  Maybe all wasn't lost after all.</p>
<p>"OK Seven, sure, lets go."</p>
<p>Seven watched as the chief engineer disappeared into the access panel and she followed without hesitation.  They climbed several levels of ladders and Seven had to send a message to her nanoprobes to increase bloodflow and respiration in order to keep up with the young Klingon.  As Seven glanced up to see how much further they had to climb, she felt a small frisson of sensation run through her, concentrating in her stomach, as she watched the shapely hips of the Lieutenant sway as they climbed.  The young drone's confusion at this unfamiliar sensation caused her to lose concentration and miss her hold on the ladder rung.  She gasped as she fought to keep from falling.</p>
<p>"Whoa, Seven, are you OK."</p>
<p>It couldn't be concern for her well being that Seven heard in the young Lt.'s voice could it?</p>
<p>"I, I am fine Lt."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't want to lose you Seven."  'Where the hell did that come from,' B'Elanna wondered to herself.  She turned back to the climb once she had ascertained that Seven was indeed alright.</p>
<p>As they began crawling through the Jefferies tube, Seven once again found herself contemplating the form of the young engineer.  She was small, compact, but Seven knew that aside from herself and possibly Commander Tuvok, there was no one aboard Voyager who was as powerful or dangerous as B'Elanna.  Seven again felt a shiver run through her frame as she observed the young Lt.'s economy of movement&#133;even crawling through this cramped space there was a grace about her that Seven admired.  Unable to control her thoughts, Seven was relieved when they finally reached the junction containing the malfunctioning gelpacks.</p>
