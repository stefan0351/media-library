<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 13 -->

<p>Sam sat sullenly at the lunch table listening to the others talk with only
half an ear.  Her attention was mostly focused on moodily rolling an apple
from one hand to the other and observing Brooke from across the room.  The
blonde had been distant that morning, just like the night before; the only
interest she showed in Sam being the extensive lengths she had gone to to
avoid the brunette.  It had changed the bad feeling she had had the previous
night into a nauseous feeling in the morning that had steadily gotten worse
throughout the day, and was reaching it's climax now that she observed
Brooke sitting beside Josh-her proximity not at all congruent with their
'ex' status-smiling at Josh, and generally-in her opinion-just fawning over
him.  She felt like she was going to be sick.</p>

<p>"Well, you were right about Brooke," Harrison said addressing Lily and
Carmen but drawing Sam's attention to him as well, probably for the first
time since they had sat down to eat.  "She's off the market again," he went
on oblivious to the wide-eyed look Sam was sending at him.  "You," he said
finally turning to the gaping brunette but not registering her expression,
"could have told me.  How could you have kept quiet about this?"</p>

<p>Sam simply stared at him blankly in response.  Harrison looked at her oddly,
but upon receiving only silence her continued to address the other occupants
of the table.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I'm surprised," he went on, "it's like they were destined
to be together, it's just so perfect," he continued shaking his head.</p>

<p>"They are?" Carmyn and Lily asked in unison, both perfectly surprised by how
well Harrison was taking the new considering how he had reacted during the
whole situation with his mother.</p>

<p>"Brooke and Josh?  Come on, it's like Ken and Barbie!  We all should have
known they'd get back together," he responded.</p>

<p>"Brooke and Josh," Carmyn repeated genuinely confused.  "What are you
talking about?"  She had expected Sam to pipe up sometime during the
conversation, but upon looking at the other girl she wasn't even sure that
the conversation was registering with her.</p>

<p>"You can give it up now," Harrison said wondering why they would still be
trying to keep it a secret.  In fact he still hadn't figured out why they
were keeping Brooke's secrets at all, but that was besides the point at the
moment.  "I was returning Josh's putter today and I heard him and Nicole
talking.  Apparently he and Brooke went on a romantic moonlight stroll last
night and she totally gave into him on the golf course.  Josh mentioned
tongue, but I don't think there's any need to get into that," he continued.
"Isn't that just so movie of the week?"</p>

<p>"Sam," Lily asked softly noticing the other girls eyes squeeze shut, a
single tear emerging from underneath and running down her face.  The only
response she got however, was as Sam stumbled up and out of her
chair-knocking it over in the process which drew looks from around the room,
including the popular table-and staggered out of the room.</p>

<p>Carmyn and Lily immediately turned to look at Brooke who seemed to follow
Sam's progress, a haunted look momentarily passing across her face, but she
diverted her attention once again.  It soon became clear to Carmyn that
Brooke was not going to get up and go after Sam, like she had somewhat
idealistically assumed she would, so she herself stood up and made her way
out of the room and after her friend.</p>

<p>"What was that about?" Harrison asked Lily in an utterly confused tone.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I know it's not good," was Lily's soft reply.</p>
