<p><b>I updated this for <i>you</i>.</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I was thankful a wolf couldn't cry, because I wanted to. I <i>needed</i> to. Pained howls emitted from my throat, but they translated into nothing but vocal grief. I was running once again, but was too weak to force myself further than the small camp I'd made for myself many weeks ago. It consisted of nothing but my duffel bag and I fell to the ground next to the small lake I sometimes watched at night, intrigued by the swirling water reflecting the stars. It did nothing for me at this moment and I panted, wishing I could just escape the sharp aches of my heart.</p>
<p>My carelessness and stupidity had taken control once more, leaving me in the same state I was in when I first arrived in these woods. Alone and distressed. The pieces I had slowly moulded back together were suddenly prey to a sharp, cynical separation and everything was just the epitome of destruction. My life never seemed to withhold any form of stability and I despised that fact. Why couldn't Miley just understand?</p>
<p>Harbouring a powerful sense of rejection, I deliberately ignored the light rustles of leaves from behind me. The scent didn't belong to Miley, so its presence meant nothing to me. It neared me and I tested the air, a slow realisation forming in my brain as I inhaled the recognisable smell once more. I sharply twisted around and found another wolf standing in the clearing with me. It's brown eyes gazed at me intently, an expression of awe painted on its pointed features.</p>
<p>Then it spoke to me, its voice uncorrupted and clear in my head. <i>Lilly... Is that you? </i></p>
<p>I flattened my ears against my head and my back fur bristled. <i>Fuck off, Oliver!</i></p>
<p><i>It </i>is<i> you! God, you look... beautiful. </i>His tone was soft, sweet, like I once remembered. He used to always speak to me like that when we were friends. Best friends.</p>
<p><i>If you come one step closer, I will rip your throat out,</i> I warned ferociously.</p>
<p><i>Whoa... what's your problem? I came all this way in search of you. You could be a little more gracious, you know.</i></p>
<p>I audibly growled. <i>Are you fucking insane? You did this to me, turned me into this...this </i>thing <i>and now mum... Oh, God, mum. She's probably in some mental institute after all the things she was screaming into the phone. </i></p>
<p><i>Oh, well. Things like that can happen. At least we have each other now, right?</i></p>
<p><i>It's all your fault I had to leave her. I had nowhere to go, Oliver. Do you think just because I'm like you know, that instantly means we should be together? That I should forgive you?</i></p>
<p><i>Well... yeah, </i>He replied, sitting back on his haunches almost innocently. It irritated me immensely and I dug my claws into the ground, hoping it would be enough to stop me from launching at him and tearing every inch of skin from his body. Not even Miley's contempt for me could compare to what I felt for Oliver.</p>
<p><i>I hate you and I don't want to be caught with you. You've caused enough trouble in my life, so it would be wise to just piss off. Right now.</i></p>
<p>Oliver didn't move, merely lowered his gaze to my neck. The collar Miley gifted me was still there, still hugging me, reminding me of my agonising loss and I looked towards the trees, beyond them, wishing for acceptance. Oliver had padded closer, his muzzle curiously sniffing the collar. I snapped at his ear and he yelped, springing back with a spray of blood in his wake. I felt an ounce of happiness upon hearing the sound of his pain, no matter how minor it was.</p>
<p><i>You... You're someone's pet? That's so pathetic. Wouldn't you rather be wild and free? In a pack where you'd be welcomed? </i></p>
<p><i>No, I don't want to be like some animal, </i>I snapped.</p>
<p><i>But we're not humans anymore, Lilly. You can't force yourself to be like them.</i></p>
<p><i>Maybe you're not human anymore, but I still am. And that's all that matters.</i></p>
<p>I gave him a stern glare, hoping he'd understand what I was conveying. I didn't want to face what I'd become. Oliver could live with being some beast, but I couldn't. I treasured my remaining humanity and no promises of equality from other animals would make me let it go. I would never belong to either end of the spectrum. I was just some nothing, some monstrosity trapped in the middle. Tempted by a side I refused to even consider and rejected by the side I craved to be a part of. I wanted my mother to see that I hadn't changed. I was still Lilly, still her daughter. I wanted Miley to smile kindly at me again and tell me I was her best friend that could never be replaced. I wanted her to hold me and wet my skin with her tears that she pretended were never shed. I wanted to comfort her and tell her in a million ways that I'd always be there for her in any possible way.</p>
<p>A light snarl burnt away the thoughts and my frail heart hardened as I focused on Oliver, his brown form slowly sinking into nature and away from my home. I hoped that it would be the last I saw of him because his appearance caused my previous sorrows to return as I relived my dormant recollections. I truly hated him.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Miley ~</p>
<p>I was listening to my iPod when it happened. The howls of Lilly were too excruciating to hear. They shook me so intensely that I feared everything inside of me, every bone, organ, would just shatter and leave me with an emptiness Lilly had unknowingly filled before. My disbelief, my confusion, it merged together to create some sort of huge mess in my head and I didn't know what to do. Music was my only escape.</p>
<p>I listened to it mindlessly for hours, allowing myself to be lost in the lyrics, praying to never be found, to never emerge from the emotionless daydreams. There was no hurting here, no remorse that burned me from beneath my skin. I itched and no amount of scratching would end it. I turned the volume up. It stung my ears and made my head pound, but with its deafening cacophony, no thoughts were able to take wing.</p>
<p>All too soon, I was interrupted by Jackson. I plucked out the ear buds as he shook my shoulder roughly and scowled at my imbecile of a brother, but the look on his face extinguished all rage.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The animals, they've been hurt. Some are dead. Blue Jeans, he-"</p>
<p>"Blue Jeans!" I cried, rocketing from my bed and past Jackson, travelling down the stairs as fast as I possibly could, needing to see what had happened myself. Jackson called after me, but I only ran faster, harder. My horse was my life. Without him, I would surely be met with my demise.</p>
<p>Daddy stood at the barn's entrance, a shotgun in hand and for a brief moment, I faltered. Images came to mind and I was suddenly petrified. What if it was Lilly who did this? What if she'd been shot? Daddy saw me coming, but it was too late, I'd already raced past him into the barn, where I was witness to a horrific slaughter.</p>
<p>The pigs lay slashed to pieces. The few stray chickens that snuck out of the pen lay dead and then I saw it, an open stall. Blue Jeans' stall. I couldn't see him. I hesitantly approached it, shrugging off the hand on my shoulder and found my horse on the ground, one of his legs covered with blood. He was still breathing, and I fell to my knees and cried, wrapping my arms around his large head and begging to all that listened to let him survive.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Lilly ~</p>
<p>I knew what he'd done before I even saw him. The squealing of pigs, the restless whinnies of the horses, I heard them. And I heard him. Oliver had attacked the Stewarts' animals. I wasn't fast enough. By the time I got there, Oliver had committed the misconducts and he bared his fangs at me in a wolfish smirk.</p>
<p><i>That girl will think it was you. She won't forgive you, Lilly. Just be my mate and it'll all be okay. </i>He said, but I blocked his voice from my head after that and lunged at him, biting, clawing, doing everything I possibly could to make him bleed, make him suffer as much as I was. He collapsed to the ground, whining, but it only lasted for a few seconds before he shook me off and attacked me. We wrestled and tore at each other for a long time, until I was unable to withstand the aching anymore. I lowered to the ground in unsolicited defeat and Oliver huffed and left me there.</p>
<p>I didn't know what he tried to tell me, but I had the feeling he was going to be back. I inhaled laboriously and wondered if any bones were broken, or if I was going to bleed to death. I saw the Stewarts' household from the hill the edge of the woods touched and closed my eyes, wishing I had the strength to get up, to go there, to see if Miley was okay. I could only smell animal blood on Oliver, but I recognised the faint scent of Blue Jeans and fretted over how Miley was handling it. I needed to find her.</p>
<p>I clenched my muscles and tried to stand, but my legs gave out from beneath me and I dropped back down with a whimper. Powerless, unable to move, I continued to lie in the grass, not sure if it would become my grave and closed my eyes.</p>
<p>My entire body was numb and a sheet of black obscured my vision. Was it night? Was I dead? I couldn't tell. I felt my fur retracting, my body reshaping, but I forced it not to. I healed faster in this form and I needed to get to Miley. I attempted to stand once more and was successful this time. I took a few unsteady steps and blinked away the darkness, my eyes adjusting to the late afternoon lighting.</p>
<p>And then I saw her.</p>
<p>Miley was positioned a few meters away from me, staring at me coldly. My tail wagged and I limped towards her, empowered by her presence. One of my paws was badly damaged, so I really only had three useful legs, but my condition didn't alter Miley's face. Her eyes were fierce, her jaw tight, but I was just so relieved to see her that I didn't notice the fatal infuriation within her gaze.</p>
<p>I was now in front of her, the blood in one of my eyes making it difficult to see her, but I knew something was wrong. I waited, hoping she would tell me what happened, if Blue Jeans was safe. But instead, what she did shocked me.</p>
<p>Miley's leg drew back, and she kicked me. My already injured ribs experienced a deathly pang and before I could react, she was kicking me repeatedly until I crumbled to the ground, not understanding what I had done to deserve this.</p>
<p>"I fucking hate you! Blue Jeans could die because of you! How could you do this?" She screamed, tears spilling from her eyes as the impact of her kicks weakened. She delivered several more until she finally fell to her knees beside me where she wept and I lost consciousness.</p>
