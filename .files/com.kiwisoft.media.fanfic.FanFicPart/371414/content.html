<p>A/N: Whoa, I haven't noticed when the review count went over 200! Thanks for all the support. I know I haven't exactly been that forthcoming with updates, but the end is near for this one (a couple of more chapters, I think.) and cursing my name won't be necessary any more, lol. Until my next project of course ;)</p>
<p>Viola was roused out of sleep by an annoying sensation that wouldn't stop tickling her nose. It had been bugging her for a while, but it was hard to find the motivation to move when she was warm and comfortable and in the only position possible where she couldn't feel the back pain. She opened her eyes to find that the annoying sensation came in the form of blond hair tickling her nose. It took a couple of blurry seconds for the dots to connect in the soccer player's mind.</p>
<p>Viola's thought process:</p>
<p><i>Blond hair?</i></p>
<p><i>(balls)</i></p>
<p><i>Hair connects to a head... Head connects to a body... Head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes!</i></p>
<p><i>(soccer balls)</i></p>
<p><i>I made out with a blond yesterday... hehe...</i></p>
<p><i>(soccer balls in a giant green field and a hot dog stand, drool)</i></p>
<p><i>OLIVIA!</i></p>
<p>Viola finally realized that it was Olivia who was cuddled up to her and smiled goofily at all the interesting memories of what had transpired between them last night. Yes, lots techniques were attempted last night. The one that stood out the most to Viola was when she had been laying face-down on the bed, her arms being held up behind her while Olivia stood over her, foot planted firmly in the middle of her back and pulling on Viola's arms with all her strength, Viola screaming in pain the entire time. Turns out, that doesn't relieve back pain much to their surprise.</p>
<p>At this moment Viola was tied down to the mattress, arms pinned securely to her side and her back ramrod straight. Olivia must have stayed fretting over her all night after she had blacked out from the pain and had fallen asleep. '<i>Awww, how cute!' </i>Viola thought as she looked at the top of Olivia's head, though she couldn't really move her head that much, being tied down and everything.</p>
<p>"Hey, Olivia!" Viola stage whispered to her girlfriend. "Olivia!"</p>
<p>"the smurfs..." Olivia mumbled.</p>
<p>"...Huh?"</p>
<p>"the smurfs are coming..." she continued to mumble. Viola had a bewildered look on her face.</p>
<p>"Why are the smurfs coming?" she asked, deciding to play along.</p>
<p>"... For your hot bod!" Olivia declared, eyes still closed. Viola stifled a guffaw at Olivia's sleep talk.</p>
<p>"Olivia, wake up!" Viola said loudly, startling Olivia out of sleep. The blond sat up, blinking sleepily at a grinning Viola. After a couple of seconds she snapped out of her sleepy stupor and worriedly hovered over Viola.</p>
<p>"Viola, are you okay? Hows your back? Do you think you can move? Did the smurfs hurt you?" Olivia asked the questions in rapid succession, not pausing for an answer.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Liv, I think I feel better... And those darn smurfs didn't hurt me either." Viola teased, making Olivia blush in embarrassment. "Could you untie me? I got a soccer game to kick ass at ya know." Olivia looked dubious but Viola just smiled innocently at her.</p>
<p>"I don't know about that Viola. Are you sure you're okay?" Olivia asked in concern. Viola attempted to give a thumbs up but remembered she was tied down and all.</p>
<p>"I'm sure! C'mon, Liv, I'm gonna be late!" Viola pleaded. Olivia sighed and started untying her. She was still worried, but she knew how much this game meant to Viola and she didn't want to be in the way of that.</p>
<p>"Fine." Olivia huffed as she untied the last of the sheets holding the soccer player down. "But if you bust your ass out in that field don't come crying to me." she grumbled. Viola giggled as she gingerly sat up, testing her back. So far, so good.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Liv, you the best!" Viola smiled good naturedly as she swung her legs off the bed.</p>
<p>"Remember to take it easy!" Olivia said, getting up to grab Viola's 'Sebastian' clothes that she had brought with her.</p>
<p>"I will! But I won't be held responsible for my actions when I see Justin's face again." Viola pointed out, already getting pumped for the game in her mind. Olivia handed the clothes to Viola with a soft smile.</p>
<p>"Neither will I, from what I heard he did."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it myself." Viola said as she took the clothes. She flashed a grateful smile to the blond. "But its nice to know you'll be cheering on the sidelines for me."</p>
<p>"With a stretcher in hand." Olivia quipped. "Do you need me to help you get dressed?" she offered.</p>
<p>"Haven't you already seen enough of the goods?" Viola said with a raised brow. Olivia blushed and looked away.</p>
<p>"I would say the same to you!"</p>
<p>"Oh, touche." Viola started to take off her shirt, Olivia immediately turning around.</p>
<p>"You sure you don't want a peek? You never know, this could be the only chance any time soon you get material for your fantasies!" Viola said with a teasing voice as she removed her bra. Olivia immediately whirled around at the accusation.</p>
<p>"Fantasies? Who, me? I don't know what you're talking... about..." by the time Olivia noticed she was yelling at a topless Viola she was already all up in her face. They stared at each other in shock before Olivia turned so red she rivaled a tomato.</p>
<p>"My, you're forward." Viola giggled. Olivia opened her mouth to retort but all that came out was incoherent vowels before she gave up. With much visible effort she straightened out, turned around, and walked out of the room with as much dignity as she could muster looking like the red rocket. Viola stared at the closed door before grinning widely. The blond was just too damn cute! Out in the hallway Olivia was banging her head on the nearest wall until she either passed out or until the pain made her forget about TOPLESS VIOLA sitting on her bed right now.</p>
<p>Oh, the cruelty!</p>
<p><i>'Well,</i>' she thought to herself as a dent formed where her forehead made acquaintance with the wall, <i>'As long as the rest of the student body doesn't get to see the goods...'</i></p>
<p>Meanwhile in Headmaster Gold's office, the ultimate evil duo, Monique and Malcolm, were seated in front of the bald-master's desk as they told their tale of woe. Gold seemed to ponder their unusual accusation against one of the new transfer students.</p>
<p>"You're sure about this?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir, we are." Monique and Malcolm said together, just like they had rehearsed back in their evil lair.</p>
<p>"Ladies, we got a game to get ready for!" Coach Dinklage yelled into the locker room of soccer players. He looked around briefly. "Wheres Hastings?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Present!" Viola called, dressed as Sebastian, while she walked into the locker room carefully.</p>
<p>"Then what the hell are you waiting for? Get a move on!" Dinklage yelled at her concerning her lack of uniform. Viola scrambled instinctively at the volume of his voice.</p>
<p>"Sir, yessir!" she called as she headed for her locker to get her uniform. As she was pulling out her gear Duke approached her from behind.</p>
<p>"Yo man, where the hell were you last night?" Duke asked his roommate.</p>
<p>"Had to deal with the ladies, ya know how it is, bro!" Viola's 'cool guy' impersonation slipping on easily. She turned around to face her captain. "Whoa, dude, where did you get your makeup done?" she indicated the red and black stripes drawn diagonally across his rugged face.</p>
<p>"All the first-stringers are getting it. The cheerleaders are doing it outside." Duke answered, immediately blushing when he thought about cheerleaders, though you couldn't tell with the paint on. "But more importantly Sebastian, a few things happened last night while you were gone."</p>
<p>"Like what?" Viola grumbled while pulling the red jersey over her head over the long-sleeved white shirt she always wore. Duke fidgeted behind her, gazing at his cleats.</p>
<p>"Well, I kinda saw Olivia... making out with your sister." His blush strengthened tenfold as he relived the memory. Viola nearly fell over at the revelation.</p>
<p>"You saw that?" she asked, voice a bit too high. Duke furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>"Huh?" The captain was clearly confused and Viola cleared her throat and gathered herself.</p>
<p>"Well, I kinda already knew... Viola had told me she had liked Olivia since the carnival and I guess Olivia felt the same way." Viola explained, watching Duke's reaction. He just nodded, accepting her words as truth.</p>
<p>"That's cool." was his only response to the information, making Viola smile gratefully at him. He really was a good friend. "But what was really weird was that a guy that kinda looked like you came into our room and claimed he was Sebastian Hastings." If Viola had been drinking something at the moment she would have done a spit-take. "Isn't that weird?" Duke asked with a slight laugh. "But don't worry about that. I kicked the impostor out. What was he trying to pull anyway?"</p>
<p>Viola was speechless as her mind raced. Someone that looked like her? And he said he was Sebastian Hastings? WASN'T HE SUPPOSED TO BE IN LONDON?</p>
<p>"But anyway, hurry up, we got a game!" Duke said loudly whilst slapping Viola on the back, hard.</p>
<p>"SON OF A BITCH!" Viola screamed in pain from the blow to her back. Just great! Just when she was starting to feel better! Duke gave her weird look.</p>
<p>"Whoa man, you okay?" he asked after her yell. Viola could only nod slightly through the pain and gave the guy a thumbs up.</p>
<p>"Yeah... Just, ya know... Getting pumped for the game... and stuff..." she managed to squeeze out with a strained voice.</p>
<p>"Riiight. Whatever works for you." Duke said before he walked off to slap other players around. Viola was kinda panicking at the moment, though. Sebastian was somewhere on campus. The question was where the hell was he and will he blow her cover? And will she even be able to play with her back so out of wack?</p>
<p>Sebastian was sleeping peacefully until he had that feeling you get that someone was watching you... or caressing your back. As he floated back to consciousness he tried to remember where he was. Back from London... Kicked out of room... Creepy girl drags him to her room... said creepy girl, who's name he figured out was Eunice, forced him to play ghost tea party with her then knocked him out after he suggested he go to sleep. He's been sleeping peacefully ever since. Slowly, the band member opened his eyes to reveal Eunice sitting on the bed across from him, staring at him intensely. Startled, he jumped up immediately and screamed like a little girl.</p>
<p>"Eunice!" he cried, voice pitched too high until he cleared his throat to get it back to its masculine tone. "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"You looked so serene." Eunice breathed fiercely.</p>
<p>"Uh, yeah. I should go." Sebastian said while he scrambled off the bed and toward the door. "Thanks for letting me sleep here!" he called over his shoulder as he made his hasty escape. Eunice held up a cupcake.</p>
<p>"But I made breakfast, Darling!"</p>
<p>Sebastian breathed a sigh of relief as he stumbled out the dorm building undetected. The halls appeared to be unusually deserted. Must have been a big event happening today on campus. <i>'No matter'</i>, he reasoned. <i>'I should probably just crash at mom's or dad's house if my 'roomie' decides I'm too masculine.' </i>Sebastian scoffed in amusement. With this plan in mind he continued walking until he spotted a group of three people walking toward him in the opposite direction. One was a bald guy with a funny looking suit carrying a bullhorn, one was a nerdy-looking kid looking too smug for his own good, and the other was...</p>
<p>"SEBASTIAN!"</p>
<p>.. Monique. Sebastian froze in his tracks when the other three stopped and stared at him. The short nerd guy stepped up and pointed accusingly at Sebastian. "Ye needeth proof of thy loins!" he shouted over-dramatically. Sebastian was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"... Prove my what?" The middle-aged baldie then stepped up and put a hand on the boy's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Now there, Malcolm. I'm sure Sebastian, I mean this young lady, has a perfectly reasonable explanation for this and will undergo intensive psychological examination." he turned to Sebastian and put the bullhorn to his lips. "<b>SEBASTIAN!"</b> the amplified voice echoed throughout the hallway.</p>
<p>"I don't think you're supposed to be using that in here." Sebastian weakly pointed out, still clueless as to what the hell these people wanted with him.</p>
<p>"<b>WE WERE GOING TO GET YOU AT THE SOCCER GAME BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DECIDED TO SKIP TOWN WHEN YOU REALIZED WE WERE ONTO YOU... VIOLA HASTINGS!" </b></p>
<p>"WHAT?" Sebastian reacted indignantly. Monique stepped up now.</p>
<p>"That's right, you non-curvy tomboy! I can't believe I fell for your act for even a second! Now me and Sebastian can be together forever!"</p>
<p>"I can't believe this shit!" Sebastian was flabbergasted. This was honestly the the last thing he ever expected and he half-wondered if Eunice had drugged him and this was all some type of hallucination.</p>
<p><b>"NOW COME AWAY QUIETLY AND NO ONE WILL GET HURT</b>." Bald-guy started saying as if soothing a wild animal as they started to advance on him.</p>
<p>"The hell I will!" Sebastian shouted. He had enough of this crap! The musician turned tail and ran hard in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>"Get her!" Malcolm shouted, mounting his noble white steed and galloping after the impostor who dared take the life of his beloved Malvolio in the name of justice! (or at least he was in his mind until Monique pushed him the hell out of the way and went after Sebastian herself.)</p>
<p>"Come back Sebast-! I mean, Viola!" she cried out in her annoying frilly voice. Headmaster Gold also dashed behind her, stepping over Malcolm's body as he went. The chase was on!</p>
