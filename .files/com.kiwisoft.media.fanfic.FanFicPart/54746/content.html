<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 2 -->

<p>When Seven awoke from her regeneration cycle she found herself alone, again.  As illogical as it was, she missed the illusion of the Chief Engineer that had been her constant companion during her ordeal in the nebula.  She was saddened to realize that even the simple pleasure of visiting B'Elanna's stasis tube was now denied her-she could no longer gaze unrestricted at the beautiful face of the Klingon hybrid.  She would miss her one-sided conversations with the fiery beauty as she had found them a valuable asset in accessing and evaluating her thoughts and emotions.  Now, more than ever, she was alone.</p>

		<p>Sighing at the illogical paths her thoughts were taking, she left her alcove.  The loneliness was overwhelming; she needed the company of her peers.  It was not in her nature to 'need' and she found the feeling disconcerting.  Even though it was her habit to partake of her nutritional supplement as quickly as possible and report to Astrometrics early for her duty shift, this morning she decided to eat breakfast with her fellow crewmates to try to alleviate the sense of separateness that was plaguing her.</p>

		<p>When she entered the messhall she did not know whether to be delighted or dismayed at the sight of B'Elanna having a meal with Tom and Harry.  She retrieved her food and then stood awkwardly near them, unsure of how to proceed.  To her surprise it was B'Elanna who came to her rescue.  The normally taciturn engineer actually invited her to sit at their table, joked with her about the quality of the food, and went so far as to say that they 'owed her one' for bringing them through the nebula safely.  It was more than Seven could have hoped for.  She took a seat beside B'Elanna and immediately dropped her eating utensil when her leg inadvertently brushed against B'Elanna's.  If any of them noticed they were too polite to draw attention to it and soon she found herself actually making conversation with the small group.  She felt completely awkward and exposed, certain that B'Elanna could read her thoughts and was aware of how Seven felt about her.  Every moment was agony and bliss at the same time.  She wanted to flee the room, at the same time as she never wanted to leave the engineer's side.  She was in heaven and in hell.  Through it all she mechanically ate, nodding in what she hoped were appropriate points in the conversation, and simply hoping that she could get through this situation without inviting the ire of the Klingon beauty sitting at her side.</p>

		<p>When the meal was over, the group began discussing their plans for the evening.  They were planning to meet for an evening of drinks and pool in Sandrine's.  Images of B'Elanna kissing Tom while they socialized with their friends rose unbidden in Seven's mind to torment her.  So absorbed was she in her thoughts that she barely heard Harry address his question to her until he asked it for the second time.</p>

		<p>"Would you like to come with us Seven?"</p>

		<p>She hesitated, unsure of whether or not she could stand to spend so much time in the company of B'Elanna knowing that the beautiful woman was with Tom.  In the end it was B'Elanna who made the decision for her.</p>

		<p>"Come on Seven, you never know you might actually have fun."  The light teasing tone of her voice took the sting out of the words for Seven, and almost involuntarily she found herself nodding her acquiescence.</p>

		<p>"Great," Harry said, "we'll meet you there at 1900hrs."</p>

		<p>Seven rose on unsteady legs and nodded to the small group of friends.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenants, ensign, thank you for your company and your kind invitation."  She barely breathed until she heard the messhall doors swish shut behind her.</p>

		<p>"That was weird," Tom laughed at Seven's overly formal departure.</p>

		<p>"Give her a break Tom, at least she trying," B'Elanna spoke up.</p>

		<p>"Since when do you defend the Ice Princess?"  Tom's surprise was evident by the look of shock on his face at hearing B'Elanna defend her adversary.</p>

		<p>"Since I heard she nearly died getting us through that nebula."</p>

		<p>"I heard she nearly killed us all by shutting off power to the stasis tubes," Tom retorted.</p>

		<p>"For a few minutes just to get the engines restarted, then she powered the tubes back up and shut off life support to keep Voyager moving.  She had no way of knowing we'd get out in time to save her from asphyxiation.  Anyone who would do that deserves a second chance in my opinion." </p>

		<p>"I'll remind you of that when you're threatening to blow her out an airlock for interfering with engineering...probably later this afternoon," Tom laughed.</p>

		<p>"Shut up Paris," B'Elanna growled.</p>

		<p>She was angry with Tom for being such a child, but even more angry with him for probably being right. She had been impressed with Seven's actions, but Kahless knew the former drone got on her nerves.  She vowed to try to be more patient with the stiff young woman and hoped that, to that end, some of the meditation techniques she learned from Tuvok might come in handy.  </p>

		<p>Seven entered Sandrine's several minutes after Tom, Harry and B'Elanna arrived.  The truth was that she been on time, but had stood outside of the holodeck doors for several minutes debating with herself over the wisdom of entering the room.  A part of her wanted to leave and return to the cargo bay where she would be safe, if alone.  But another part of her wanted to enter the holodeck and be near B'Elanna, no matter what it cost her personally.  In the end, the fact that she had given her word that she would appear was the deciding factor and she took a deep breath before striding into the room.</p>

		<p>As soon as the door opened and Seven of Nine appeared, B'Elanna felt a flash of annoyance.  The coldly superiour look on Seven's face never failed to irritate her.  She watched as the Astrometrics officer strode through the bar toward them.  When Seven reached their table she hesitated, uncertain of her welcome and unsure of what to do with herself now that she had arrived.  As B'Elanna watched the look of uncertainty flit briefly across Seven's haughty features she felt her anger fade.  'It's just a front,' she thought to herself as she saw Seven assume her customary stance beside their table.</p>

		<p>"Have a seat Seven," B'Elanna felt herself smiling up at Seven, amazed to see a small smile grace the former drone's features for a second before she once again became her inscrutable self.</p>

		<p>Tom jumped up and came back with a tray of drinks and soon he and Harry were entertaining the group with stories from their last away mission.  Seven was seated across from B'Elanna and she passed the time that Tom spent bragging about his piloting skills observing the Klingon hybrid surreptitiously.  B'Elanna did not appear to be listening closely to Tom's story at all, in fact her eyes were unfocussed and Seven would have bet that she was working through some problem in engineering the entire time that she was smiling and nodding at the flight controller's antics.  Tom didn't seem to notice in the least that half his audience was paying him no mind and he and Harry continued trading barbs and laughing until it was their turn claim the pool table.</p>

		<p>"So, whaddaya say...girls against the guys," Tom taunted as she racked up the balls.  He was enjoying paying B'Elanna back for her defense of the Borg earlier.  He fully expected her to make an excuse to not have to partner with Seven, and in fact it had been on the tip of her tongue to do just that when she saw the look in Tom's eyes.</p>

		<p>"If you think you can handle us flyboy," she replied.</p>

		<p>Seven felt as if she was getting into a situation that was beyond her social skills, so as much as she wished to play with B'Elanna she felt compelled to speak up.</p>

		<p>"I have never played this game before, perhaps it would be better if Lieutenant Torres had a more experienced partner."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna could clearly see the discomfort on Seven's face and she hastened to reassure her.</p>

		<p>"Don't worry Seven, with your hand-eye coordination you'll catch on in no time," she said with a wink.</p>

		<p>Seven thought that her heart would never beat again when she saw the beautiful engineer wink at her.  Still, she wanted to be certain that B'Elanna knew what she was getting into.</p>

		<p>"If you are certain Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"I'm certain Seven, you'll do fine," she said as she handed Seven a cue.</p>

		<p>When B'Elanna's fingers brushed hers as she took the cue from the engineer's hands, once again Seven lost all sense of time and space.  She nearly dropped the stick from her nerveless fingers and felt her face heat up with embarrassment as she saw Tom laughing, presumably at her clumsiness.  She watched carefully as the helmsman broke the triangle of balls, and then observed every nuance as both B'Elanna and Harry lined up the balls and took their shots.  She listened carefully as B'Elanna explained the game to her, gritting her teeth to maintain her concentration at she felt the Klingon's hands on her hips, and then her shoulders as she showed her how to take aim and make her shot.  Her heart was pounding but she forced herself to focus and to her delight she sank the ball she was aiming at with a quick flick of her arm, her heart fell however when she saw the white ball follow the other one down into the pocket.</p>

		<p>"I am sorry Lieutenant," she foolishly felt as if she might cry at the sound of Tom and Harry gloating good-naturedly over her mistake.  </p>

		<p>"Don't worry about it Seven, you're doing great."  For an instant Seven felt as if she were back in the nebula and this was her illusion of B'Elanna being so kind and compassionate.  </p>

		<p>Despite her best effort Tom and Harry won the first game by several balls.  Tom suggested switching partners and to Seven's surprise B'Elanna refused.</p>

		<p>"Oh no you don't Paris.  You challenged us and now you're just going to have to take your medicine.  Right Seven?"</p>

		<p>"Correct."  Seven was uncertain as to how exactly to participate in this kind of banter so she followed B'Elanna's lead, happy that the engineer wished to keep playing with her despite their defeat.</p>

		<p>The second game wasn't even close as B'Elanna practically ran the table before Tom or Harry could get in a shot.  So it came down to a third and deciding game.  B'Elanna missed her first shot and Harry sank several in a row.  They played quite evenly, with Seven managing to sink several balls in a row much to her delight and relief.  In the end it came down to a tie.  Only the black ball remained and it was Seven's shot.  If she missed then Tom would have an opportunity to win the game.  Despite her normally cool Borg exterior Seven was nervous and to her dismay she felt her hands trembling as she lined up the shot.  B'Elanna leaned on the table beside her and whispered so that only Seven could hear.</p>

		<p>"You can do it Seven-just concentrate."</p>

		<p>Seven sucked in a quick breath as B'Elanna echoed precisely the words her specter had uttered on the bridge while they were trapped in the nebula.  She closed her eyes for a moment and then concentrating fiercely she lined up the ball and made her shot.  She heard B'Elanna's whoop of elation almost before she saw the ball find a home in the pocket, and to her amazement she felt the fiery engineer pick her up and spin her around.  She was actually in B'Elanna's arms!  When her feet were once again on the ground she graciously accepted the congratulations of both Tom and Harry.</p>

		<p>"Well, hate to cut your gloating time short, but Harry and I have Holodeck 2 reserved for the next couple of hours," Tom informed.</p>

		<p>"What are you talking about Tom.  I thought we agreed that we were spending the evening here, together?" B'Elanna asked with an angry edge to her voice.</p>

		<p>"I know, I know, but the group that had the other holodeck reserved had to cancel at the last minute so we grabbed it.  You CAN come with us you know.  We're gonna run Captain Proton-you could be my secretary if you'd like," he teased wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.  "Of course you and Seven could always stay here and play some more pool if you'd like," he said.</p>

		<p>Once again B'Elanna knew that Tom was rubbing her nose in her defense of Seven, but this time she didn't care.  She was so angry that he always chose his friends and his holoprograms over her that she didn't even care that she was stuck here in Sandrine's with Seven.</p>

		<p>"I'm certain the lieutenant has better things to do with her time.  Thank you all for a lovely evening," Seven replied and prepared to go back to her cargo bay.</p>

		<p>"Hold on Seven, if you want to stay I could use the company," B'Elanna said, staring right into the amused eyes of the pilot.  She knew she was being manipulated by Tom, but the stubborn Klingon in her couldn't let go.</p>

		<p>"I...would like that Lieutenant." Seven replied shyly.</p>

		<p>"I think it's about time you started calling me B'Elanna, don't you?"</p>

		<p>"As you wish...B'Elanna."  In truth Seven always thought of the engineer that way in her mind, but had been reluctant to take such a liberty out loud until now.  She was both terrified and thrilled at the prospect of interacting alone with B'Elanna socially for the first time.</p>

		<p>Tom threw his arm around Harry's shoulders and began explaining in detail the portion of the Captain Proton program they were about to run as they left Sandrine's together.  B'Elanna's knuckles were white where she clutched her pool cue and tried to control her anger.  She was startled when she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Are you certain you wish to remain B'Elanna?  It would be understandable if you did not."</p>

		<p>"What...no, I mean yes...I'm sure I want to stay.  The truth is I could use the distraction.  Why don't you rack 'em up."</p>

		<p>Seven moved quickly to set up the balls before B'Elanna changed her mind and left.  She motioned for the engineer to break and the two of them began moving around the table, quietly playing the game.  It was B'Elanna who finally broke the silence.</p>

		<p>"You're being awfully quiet Seven...what's up"</p>

		<p>Seven hesitated before she answered the question.  She was a little afraid of B'Elanna's reaction, but she could not bring herself to be less than honest with her.</p>

		<p>"I am enjoying our interaction, and I do not wish it to end prematurely.  To further that end I am keeping my trap shut."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna choked on the sip of beer she had been taking when Seven answered her question.  Finally she sputtered</p>

		<p>"Keeping your trap shut?"</p>

		<p>"Stardate 51658.2 you told me that if I wanted to live long enough to see the Alpha Quadrant I should just shut my trap and let you think."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna felt the colour rise to her cheeks.</p>

		<p>"I really said that?"</p>

		<p>"I assure you that you did."</p>

		<p>"Kahless I can be a read hardass sometimes.  I'm sorry Seven...it's just sometimes..."</p>

		<p>"I irritate the hell out of you," Seven interrupted.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna barked out a laugh at Seven's comment.  It never occurred to her that Seven could be so self-aware.  She found herself laughing until tears ran down her cheeks, and every time she thought she had it under control she would hear Seven's words again in her head and the laughter would begin again.  </p>

		<p>"Kahless Seven, I can't remember the last time I laughed like that," she said when she finally had control of her voice again.</p>

		<p>"That is truly a pity B'Elanna, you are lovely when you laugh."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was a little taken aback by Seven's comment, but it had been a long time since anyone had called her lovely-she had forgotten how good it felt.</p>

		<p>"Thanks Seven," she said sincerely.</p>

		<p>The rest of the evening passed quickly and an easy camaraderie began to grow between the two women.  They discussed several engineering problems that the crew was working on, and to her surprise B'Elanna found herself having a good time.  She was amazed when Seven told her of her experiences alone in the nebula, and touched to find that it had been Seven's image of her that had allowed the former borg to be able to continue functioning.  Seven left out many of the details of those lonely weeks, but she wanted B'Elanna to know how much she had appreciated the engineer's unwitting assistance during that stressful time.  Even though B'Elanna had had nothing to do with Seven's hallucinations it made her unaccountably proud to think that Seven had drawn strength from her image.  It was with real regret that B'Elanna noticed how late it was getting. </p>

		<p>"I hate to say it Seven, but I really should be getting to bed.  I have an early day tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"Of course B'Elanna, as do I."  Seven hesitated a moment before continuing.  "I had a wonderful time with you tonight.  Thank you."</p>

		<p>"I had a lot of fun Seven.  We should do this again."  B'Elanna felt awkward talking like this with someone she had never particularly gotten along with, but it was the simple truth.</p>

		<p>"I would very much like that," Seven replied, happy to think that B'Elanna wanted to spend more time with her.  "Sleep well B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"I'll see you tomorrow," B'Elanna said as they parted ways in the corridor.</p>

		<p>For the first time since she had come aboard Voyager Seven no longer felt alone.  She couldn't remember ever feeling quite so happy.  She resolutely refused to think about the fact that later tonight Tom Paris would probably be stopping by B'Elanna's quarters; that was something she would rather forget.</p>
