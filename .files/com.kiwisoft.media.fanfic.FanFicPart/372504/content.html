<p><b>Chapter 9</b><br>
"Hey," Quinn said, lifting her head up from Rachel's shoulder. "What happened in that book?"</p>
<p>It had been two days since Finn had shown up unexpectedly and things had gone back to better than normal in the cabin. Quinn was glad to have her relationship with Rachel out in the open; it meant not hiding kisses or having to hold hands under blankets. She snuggled with Rachel on the couch and flirted openly at dinner ("Come on baby, just try it." "I hate asparagus, Quinn." "If you try the asparagus then I'll kiss you." "Fine.") and it felt pretty damn good.</p>
<p>Currently, everyone was piled in the Berry SUV and on the way to the berry patch just outside of town where they were holding a festival.</p>
<p>"Which book?"</p>
<p>Quinn grinned. "You know…that one book."</p>
<p>Rachel turned bright red and Quinn couldn't help but laugh. "The protagonist gets her heart broken," Rachel said vaguely. "But has high hopes that she can be with the one she loves in the end."</p>
<p>Quinn nodded. "I think she will be."</p>
<p>"What makes you so sure?"</p>
<p>"Some things you just know."</p>
<p>Rachel snuggled deeper into Quinn's side and the blonde just smiled and entwined her fingers with her girlfriend's. Quinn glanced up in the rear-view mirror at one point and caught Bruce's gaze. When he narrowed his eyes a little, Quinn tucked her lower lip between her teeth and straightened up away from Rachel a bit. Bruce smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Good to know that works."</p>
<p>"Don't pay any attention to him, Quinn," Rachel purred. "As they say, his bark is worse than his bite."</p>
<p>"Just looking out for my number one girl."</p>
<p>"I'm your <i>only</i> girl, Daddy."</p>
<p>Quinn giggled and nuzzled the side of Rachel's head. She pressed her lips to the girl's temple and whispered quietly, "You're my number one, baby."</p>
<p>Rachel turned her head and returned Quinn's smile; the blonde was taken by surprise when Rachel pulled her in for a kiss. Not just a chaste kiss, either. A full on lip sucking, tongue pressing for entrance kind of kiss.</p>
<p>"Girls," Judy said, still looking down at the book she'd been focused on, "I may be hip to the lifestyle but Quinnie is still my little girl and there are things a mother doesn't want to see or hear."</p>
<p>Thoroughly humiliated, Quinn blushed and pressed a quick kiss to Rachel's forehead just as Bruce pulled into the berry patch parking lot.</p>
<p>"Meet back here for lunch at noon," Michael said as Quinn scrambled out of the SUV pulling Rachel with her.</p>
<p>The pair walked around the festival for a while and saw jars of jelly and jam, fresh berries, homemade items such as quilts, pillows, paintings, and potholders (all of which were berry-themed), pies, cobblers, and even wines. They stopped at a table to sample the fresh berries and Quinn watched with amusement as Rachel carefully looked over each berry before selecting a few blackberries to sample. The blonde shrugged and picked up a fresh strawberry to bite into. She had to admit that it was pretty damn delicious.</p>
<p>"Quinn," Rachel said with a suggestive smirk, "you have berry juice on your chin."</p>
<p>Quinn choked a little. Two could play this game. "The berry is so sweet and juicy, though." Quinn watched Rachel's eyes widen as she licked her lips and then, slowly, took each finger in her mouth and sucked off the remainder of the strawberry juice. "I love the taste of this berry."</p>
<p>Rachel's mouth opened and closed a few times and Quinn watched her eyes darken a little. "Do you make a habit of licking berry juice off of your fingers?"</p>
<p>"If I have the chance I'd like to do it a lot in the future." Quinn picked up a blueberry and popped into her mouth, moaning a little dramatically at the taste, and watched Rachel's eyes as they never left her lips. Quinn held out her hand with a smile and took one last shot. "There are a lot more berries I'd like to sample. Shall we?"</p>
<p>Quinn laughed as Rachel nodded absentmindedly and took her hand to be led around the festival. The blonde hoped and prayed that she could catch a break and get a little time alone with Rachel in the next few days because, as was obvious by the conversation they'd just had, there was <i>a lot</i> they wanted to get out.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," a loud voice booming through the festival grounds made the pair stop and search until their eyes hit a stage a rather large man was standing on with a smile. "There are fifteen minutes left to register for this year's pie eating contest. We've got our returning champion, Stan Ackerman," the man gestured to an even larger man standing in the front of the crowd, "and five others who dare go against the three-time undefeated champ. There are four more slots open, anyone can sign up! The competition starts in half an hour and there's a hundred dollar prize for the winner."</p>
<p>Quinn grinned. "Oh yeah."</p>
<p>"Quinn?"</p>
<p>"Come on, I'm signing up."</p>
<p>"Quinn, these things are barbaric and I'm certain that eating pies that quickly isn't good for your health. Did you see the champion? The man is-"</p>
<p>"I was pregnant, Rachel. I know how to scarf down food and it's just one pie."</p>
<p>Rachel whined as Quinn pulled her through the crowd to the sign up table. The blonde filled out the forms quickly and selected strawberry pie as her pie of choice. The woman at the table went over the rules: no using hands, first one to completely finish the pie won and she had to keep it down. Oh yeah, this was going to be awesome. Rachel kept protesting until Stan approached the table and laughed as Quinn signed her name.</p>
<p>"Good luck, stick figure," he said. "Sorry sweetie, you don't have a chance. Have you ever even finished off a slice of pie?"</p>
<p>Before Quinn could say anything she was practically shoved out of the way and Rachel was standing in front of her, facing this man that was more than a foot and a half taller and at least three times her weight.</p>
<p>"I'll have you know, sir, that she is more than prepared to beat you in this competition."</p>
<p>"Okay half-pint."</p>
<p>Quinn held onto Rachel's arm, knowing the girl was probably fearless enough to take on this giant, and chuckled as Rachel shrieked and then growled.</p>
<p>"Prepare to be obliterated."</p>
<p>The man just chuckled and thundered away toward the stage; Rachel shrieked again and then pulled Quinn toward the stage where the other contestants were gathering. She didn't say a word as she sat Quinn down and pulled her hair back, tying it with a tie she pulled from somewhere Quinn was unaware of. Quinn gave a small wave to Rachel's dads and her mother who had joined the crowd of observers.</p>
<p>"You got this, baby," Rachel whispered. "Kick some ass."</p>
<p>"I thought pie eating was-"</p>
<p>"Shut up and eat, Quinn."</p>
<p>"Can't wait to hear that again," Quinn mumbled. She didn't think Rachel heard her until a tongue darted out to flick over the shell of her ear.</p>
<p>"You will," Rachel murmured against her ear.</p>
<p>Quinn shuddered and watched, mouth open, as Rachel sauntered off the stage. Her attention went back to the competition when her pie was set in front of her and the announcer told the contestants to get ready. Quinn clasped her hands behind her back and popped her neck; she looked on either side of her to check out the competition and she smirked. She had this in the bag. Her only worry was Stan but she was willing to bet that Stan had never been pregnant and craving something so much that he was willing to threaten someone for it. As soon as the announcer yelled "go", Quinn dove in face first.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">XXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>"Girls want sex just as much as guys do."</p>
<p>It was true. Really, very true. At least as far as Rachel was concerned. She was careful about who she shared it with, though. There had only ever been two, one who had broken her heart, and the other who was standing there licking strawberry juice off of her fingers and staring straight at Rachel while doing it. Rachel had meant the start of the berry discussion to be a joke, really, but then it turned into this innuendo filled conversation and Rachel could practically feel her eyes turn dark. For one of the few times in her life Rachel was actually rendered speechless. She felt like something inside of her was set ablaze and the fire grew more intense with every move of Quinn's lips. She then fully realized the meaning behind "It's all about the teasing". And she hated it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they were in the middle of a festival, and being in the middle of that festival meant no alone time and plenty of distractions. Rachel wondered if Quinn possibly had some sort of attention deficit disorder because she seemed to snap out of it the minute she heard the announcer talk about the pie eating contest. The apprehensions Rachel had about the contest were cut short when that ugly man insulted her precious girlfriend. Rachel's intense competitive side took over and she was damn determined that Quinn would win. She was a little taken aback by the comment the blonde made but she retaliated quite beautifully, she thought.</p>
<p>Rachel watched from the front of the crowd as the announcer yelled "go" and Quinn buried her face in the strawberry pie. Rachel cheered loudly, her voice carried around the crowds and she knew she was getting looked at by others but she didn't care. She watched Quinn devour the whipped cream, strawberries, and pie crust and proceed to lick up what she'd missed. Brief flashes of what else that tongue could quite possibly do went through Rachel's brain until Quinn threw her hands up and the announcer yelled for everyone to stop. Rachel held her breath as the announcer looked down at the pie plate.</p>
<p>"We have a new champion!" he yelled.</p>
<p>Rachel jumped up and down and practically skipped all the way up the stage to meet Quinn in a hug. After giving a smug nod to Stan she turned her attention back to her girlfriend and squeezed her tight. The announcer handed Quinn a small trophy and told her where she could go to pick up the prize money and the stage was rushed again by Rachel's dads and Quinn's mom, all of whom were offering their congratulations. With the view from the crowd blocked, Rachel leaned up to give a congratulatory kiss to her girlfriend, not caring that she was still covered in pie.</p>
<p>After helping Quinn clean off the five found something to eat and then picked up baskets to go into the berry fields to pick. Rachel led Quinn away from the adults and through the thick bushes because, duh, alone time. They picked two baskets full and were headed back to pay for them when Rachel stopped and grinned at her girlfriend. She dropped her basket on the ground and checked for anyone that might be around before reaching up to loop her arms around Quinn's neck; Quinn's hands were on her waist immediately, strong yet gentle. Quinn's eyes were soft and warm and her smile at Rachel was one the brunette had only seen directed at her. Quinn had changed so much in the summer that it was almost unbelievable to Rachel.</p>
<p>"I'm proud of you," Rachel whispered.</p>
<p>"It was just a pie eating contest, Rach."</p>
<p>Rachel shook her head. "Not just that. It's everything. It's you as a whole and just…us."</p>
<p>"It's been a crazy summer."</p>
<p>"I must agree. But, I must also say that it's been one of the best I think I've experienced thus far in my life."</p>
<p>"Mine, too."</p>
<p>Rachel smiled and reached up to kiss the blonde. Tongues met in a dual for dominance until Quinn broke away and kissed down Rachel's jaw to her neck, nipping and biting. Quinn's teeth found a spot that Rachel didn't even know she had that made her go weak at the knees, literally. Quinn held her up, though, and kept her close.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Quinn's voice was low and hoarse as she whispered.</p>
<p>"A little over-stimulated."</p>
<p>"We really need to get our parents out of the cabin."</p>
<p>"Most definitely."</p>
<p>Once Rachel figured out how to properly work her legs again the pair made their way back to the cash register where they met her dads and Judy. They had plenty of berries to last them for the rest of vacation and probably plenty to take home with them and they picked up Quinn's prize money. As they walked through the festival back to the parking lot they were handed questionnaires about the berry patch as well as a schedule of the events happening later in the evening.</p>
<p>"Quinnie, which berry was your favorite?" Rachel heard Judy ask as they filled out their surveys.</p>
<p>Quinn leaned over and Rachel furrowed her eyebrows until the blonde whispered in her ear, "Rachel."</p>
<p>Rachel squeaked.</p>
<p>"The strawberries, Mom."</p>
<p>Judy hummed and then scribbled out the rest of the survey. Rachel turned her attention back to the questionnaire her dads were filling out.</p>
<p>"Oh! Bruce, Michael, there's a wine tasting tonight!"</p>
<p>Rachel snapped her head up to look at Judy who was positively glowing as she pointed to the schedule of events. Her eyes met Quinn's and the blonde's were just as hopeful. Rachel looked back to her dads who both looked unsure.</p>
<p>"Dad, Daddy, I highly recommend it. You haven't been able to participate in many adult activities this summer due to the underage status of Quinn and myself and I assume that interaction with other adults is just as important as teens interacting with each other as well."</p>
<p>"Right," Bruce said, his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"I'm sure there's an activity for the girls," Judy said, looking back down to the schedule. "Yes, look, there's a dessert social!"</p>
<p>Rachel almost groaned until Quinn beat her to it.</p>
<p>"Mom, I just scarfed down a whole pie. Dessert is the last thing I want right now. I think I should probably just stay at the cabin and sleep it off."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be comfortable at an event in a strange place by myself," Rachel added, trying not to sound too eager.</p>
<p>"If the girls want to stay at the cabin that's alright with me," Judy said with a nod.</p>
<p>Rachel saw both of her fathers grimace a little and then nod. Rachel's only thought?</p>
<p>Finally.</p>
<p>It was agreed, since Rachel was firm on no one drinking and driving and also saving the environment, that the adults would stay at the festival since the wine tasting was only a few hours away while Rachel and Quinn took the SUV back to the cabin. Bruce reluctantly handed the keys off to Quinn and Rachel barely said goodbye to her dads before running like a bat out of hell to the parking lot with Quinn in tow.</p>
<p>The drive to the cabin was painstaking. Rachel had Quinn's hand clasped in her own as the blonde carefully navigated back. When she pulled up to the cabin they sat in silence for a few seconds before Quinn turned her head and nodded a little.</p>
<p>"So…yeah?"</p>
<p>Rachel nodded. "Yes, please."</p>
<p>Rachel's heart was racing as she sprinted to the cabin door and followed Quinn inside. The blonde silently led Rachel to the Fabray side of the cabin and into her bedroom. It started like any of their other heated make-outs except this time Rachel knew that there wouldn't be an interruption. Quinn kicked off her shoes and socks; Rachel did the same. The pair emptied their pockets onto the dresser, Quinn sat on the bed and beckoned Rachel forward with a smile and a curl of her finger; Rachel answered said beckon by straddling Quinn's lap and smiling like a Cheshire cat. She wasted no time and immediately crushed her lips against Quinn's; the gesture was returned enthusiastically. Before Rachel even knew what happened, her shirt was unbuttoned and piled on Quinn's floor. Rachel got rid of Quinn's shirt quickly and they moved to the head of the bed in a more horizontal position. Everything was perfect and running smoothly until the sound of "Defying Gravity" filled the room.</p>
<p>Rachel dropped her forehead onto Quinn's shoulder and whimpered.</p>
<p>"Don't get it," Quinn whispered as her fingers started tugging at Rachel's bra.</p>
<p>"It's probably my dads."</p>
<p>Rachel reluctantly got out of bed and looked at her caller ID. She growled when she saw her daddy's number on the screen.</p>
<p>"Hello, Daddy." She didn't even try to hide her agitation.</p>
<p>"Hey sweetie, we just wanted to make sure you got back to the cabin alright."</p>
<p>"We're fine. Are you going to call every fifteen minutes?"</p>
<p>"I might."</p>
<p>"Then I may just call every fifteen minutes next time you and Dad go out of town for your anniversary."</p>
<p>There was silence and Rachel smirked, knowing she'd won.</p>
<p>"I'll call you when we're done."</p>
<p>"Love you, Daddy."</p>
<p>"Love you, too."</p>
<p>Rachel hung up the phone and dropped it back to the dresser. When she turned to look at Quinn she licked her lips a little at the almost topless blonde who was now propped up on her elbows with an expectant look on her face.</p>
<p>"They won't be bothering us anymore tonight."</p>
<p>"I heard."</p>
<p>"Any ideas on what we should do with our time?"</p>
<p>Rachel felt her mouth slowly drop open as Quinn sat up and unhooked her own bra then tossed it on the floor.</p>
<p>"I've got a few ideas."</p>
<p>It only took a split second before Rachel was back on top of Quinn. The remainder of the clothing was discarded and Rachel pulled the blankets up around them; the feeling of skin on skin was amazing. Quinn was soft and smooth and the little sounds she made when Rachel pressed here or bit there were better than any music the brunette had ever heard. It wasn't perfect and it was a little uncomfortable in the twin bed; Rachel couldn't wait to get Quinn into the queen size bed she had at home, but it worked. There were a few fumbles and a couple of hisses and more than once Rachel had to remind Quinn that she wasn't made of glass and she wasn't going to break. In the end, when Rachel regained the feeling in her hands after having gripped the sheets so tight she thought she might rip them to shreds and Quinn was kissing her way back up to lie her head on Rachel's chest, it was everything Rachel had imagined and so much more.</p>
<p>"Rachel?"</p>
<p>"Hm?" Feeling Quinn's eyes on her, Rachel slowly opened hers and peered down to see Quinn looking back up at her. Quinn smiled ever so slightly and Rachel searched for a moment to find the blonde's hand and entwine their fingers.</p>
<p>"I love you."</p>
<p>"I love you, too."</p>
<p>The seconds ticked by and Rachel threaded the fingers of her free hand through Quinn's hair and smiled at the sensation of Quinn's lips occasionally pressing against the swell of her breasts. Rachel moved her hand to cup Quinn's jaw and their gazes met once more.</p>
<p>"Quinn?"</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"You have Berry juice on your chin."</p>
<p>Rachel smirked a little until Quinn pulled away and grabbed hold of Rachel's ribcage and started tickling. Rachel squealed and squirmed and eventually got Quinn's hands away from her and flipped the pair over. She smiled down at her lover and dipped her head down for a kiss to start the cycle of touches and moans and (very loud) declarations of love and climaxes all over again. And then again. They only stopped when Rachel's dads called that the wine tasting was over and it took almost more energy than Rachel had to pry herself away from Quinn's embrace to get dressed and try to make it look like she hadn't just had a sex marathon. Judging by the fact that her fathers refused to ask or even go near the question of, "what did you girls do this evening?", it didn't work.</p>
