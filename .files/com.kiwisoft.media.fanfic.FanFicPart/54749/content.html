<!-- My Protector \ Part 1 -->

<p>The changing sleep patterns of middle age were unpleasant for Dr.
Holis and she responded to the midnight call with bleary eyes and a nasty
attitude. She was thankful to whichever benevolent spirit of nature it was that
gave her the strength to hide her irritation from Elder Tai-Po. And when she saw
the broken body of her patient she quickly slipped into her role of efficient
healer, forgetting her vexation. She assessed the damage with a hand held
scanner.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is this unfortunate soul, a Menial from the outer realm?&quot; She
had gotten used to treating slaves brought to her by the elder and assumed this
was the latest runaway.</p>
<p>Tai-Po struggled briefly with his thoughts about how much to tell the doctor.
&quot;No,&quot; he slowly responded and ran thick fingers absently over his
mottled goatee, both gray and brown. &quot;The wreckage of her craft leaves many
questions only she can answer since the rest of her crew are dead. When will she
be able to talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Cara finished scanning and programmed her mechanical assistant to begin the
healing process, including a healthy dose of anesthesia to keep her patient
unconscious during the most intense mending that would take place during the
next eighteen hours. Her patient had lost half of her normal blood volume,
suffered multiple broken bones in her limbs along with damage to her liver and
intestines. She had a concussion and skull fractures but the brain itself was
intact. All things considered, she was a lucky woman, whoever she was.</p>
<p>&quot;She should be up and about and able to answer your questions in
twenty-four hours&quot;.</p>
<p>After placing a drop of blood in another scanning device, Cara waited a few
seconds and then read what information the general data library contained about
her patient. She inhaled sharply before turning to look at the elder.</p>
<p>&quot;This can’t be right. Who is this woman?&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-Po smiled grimly, revealing uneven teeth. &quot;I checked the same data
myself. Impossible as it seems, our patient was born in the year nineteen
ninety-two AD, nearly a thousand years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Cara stared in awe at her patient as the Healer whirred and whined, bringing
flesh and bone back together, sealing vessels and linking nerves that the doctor
could not see. In a short time there would be little evidence of any injury at
all. Realizing the anthropological opportunity that her new patient provided,
Cara looked forward to tomorrow when she would regain consciousness. First hand
information about what life was like a thousand years ago would break up the
monotony around the palace and give them something to talk about other than the
damnable rebellion. As she considered the welcome novelty, Tai-Po broke into her
thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;And as I said Cara, there are many questions to be answered. Don’t
tell anyone else about this patient until I’ve talked with her.&quot; He
tilted his head down to Cara in an intimidating gesture. &quot;Agreed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand Elder.&quot; Cara felt relieved when he left abruptly.
Tai-Po was the least liked of the elders, and the most feared. He was obviously
courting Empress Sarika and Cara hoped the new empress would not take him as her
mate. The only thing he cared about was himself. The Empress and the Empire
deserved better.</p>

<p>&quot;Brace yourselves for
impact,&quot; Major Ramsey shouted to her crew. One minute they were getting a
closer look at a bantam asteroid only a short distance from earth and the next
all hell broke loose. In rapid motion the asteroid and her ship collided. Their
small spacecraft had not been built to withstand such an event. Bright flashes
of light blinded her. The next thing she was aware of was the rapid descent of
her ship through earth’s atmosphere and the instructions she shouted came
automatically. They were going to hit hard. Her last emotion was regret that she
could not save her crew.</p>
<p>A dull throbbing pain at the side of her head got her attention and she
opened her eyes to see why she could not raise her hand. &quot;What the....
?&quot; She was lying bare naked strapped to a metal bed.</p>
<p>Cara looked up from her desk and moved to stand close to her patient,
speaking with a reassuring tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Glad to see you’re awake. The restraints are only a precaution until
you’ve talked with Elder Tai-Po.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey calmed herself after rejecting the thought that she was literally in
Hell. She wondered at the unusual accent of the gray-haired woman. &quot;Who are
you? Where is my crew?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m Dr. Holis, Cara Holis.&quot; She covered Ramsey with a blanket
and her tone turned sympathetic. &quot;I’m sorry to say there were no other
survivors of the crash.&quot; She allowed Ramsey a minute to process the bad
news.</p>
<p>&quot;The Elder will be here in a while and he’ll have questions for you.
It would be wise for you to answer truthfully. I just got you healed and I don’t
want to have to do it all over again. In the meantime feel free to ask me
anything you want while I check the Healer’s work.&quot;</p>
<p>With the scientist’s eye for perfection she noted that there was no signs
of trauma to be found on Laren Ramsey’s body as she scanned her once again.
But the mind was another matter. She wished to ask her how she happened to crash
and how it was that she was nearly a thousand years old. What was Dethra like a
thousand years ago? Her dread of Tai-Po prevented such questions.</p>
<p>Ramsey had lost comrades before and it always left her sad and angry. And
this time they were under her command. She was responsible for their lives and
now they were dead. She should have died, not her crew. She pushed away her
grief.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright doctor, where am I?&quot;</p>
<p>Looking into Ramsey’s striking blue eyes at that moment produced a tremor
that moved along Cara’s spine. Now that she was no longer a smashed bloody
mess, Laren Ramsey looked extraordinary. She seemed no more than thirty years
old with a physical presence that could not be ignored. This one was strong. If
Tai-Po could not find a use for her, he would probably feel compelled to break
her before he killed her. She did not want to feel empathy for Ramsey, but could
not help herself.</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the palace of the Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Empress?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. The Empress of Dethra.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of Dethra?&quot; Ramsey repeated Cara's words again as though she were
doing a parody of a well-trained parrot. &quot;We’re on earth, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes. Dethra used to be called earth a millenium ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A millenium ago? What year is this?&quot;</p>
<p>So she does not know, thought Cara. &quot;Well, it’s not the twenty-first
century.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean it’s the thirty-first century?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, but soon it will be. Well, we don’t keep track of years that
way anymore and it’s actually the year four hundred and eight of the Era of
Peace. But it would seem that you were born about a thousand years ago. Nineteen
ninety-two, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. How did you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Recorded history. Even the minute details are in our data library, up
until you and your crew disappeared in the year two thousand and twenty. You
must have been twenty-eight years old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you’re not dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seems not-- The last thing I remember is an asteroid hitting my ship.
Wait-- there was a change in motion before the asteroid hit us. Everything
seemed to speed up. I think we entered a time-space distortion of some sort that
caused the collision and brought us into the future. A thousand years forward
apparently. What do you think Dr. Holis?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young woman, I think you’ve traveled a very long way and that you can
call me Cara.&quot;</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Tai-Po entered the infirmary with a flourish and scowled. &quot;Why
didn’t you notify me that Ramsey had regained consciousness?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She hasn’t been awake for more than a few minutes Elder.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey disliked the man immediately. She was repulsed by the edge of fear she
heard in Cara’s voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Leave us now. I have many things to ask and I’m sure you have better
things to do than watch us talk Cara.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right. But remember she’s been through a lot already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I forget nothing, including insolence. Leave us.&quot; Cara reluctantly
left hoping her patient would not be harmed again so soon.</p>
<p>Tai-Po turned his intimidating look to Ramsey who was now amused by him.</p>
<p>&quot;Ask away&quot;, she smiled winsomely and looked down at her restrained
wrists, &quot;I promise not to leave.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don’t be coy Major Ramsey, it doesn’t suit you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coy? I apologize for giving you that impression Elder…. Elder Tai-Po
isn’t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may call me Elder Tai-Po, yes. And if you answer my questions
satisfactorily you will go free. Why are you here Ramsey?&quot;</p>
<p>No more ‘Major’. Ramsey thought it was interesting that he insisted on
using his title though. &quot;I’m here as a result of a freak accident I
figure. My crew and I had a little asteroid to watch and suddenly everything
speeded up and our ship collided with it. The next thing I knew we were going
down through the atmosphere and here I am. Apparently a thousand years has gone
by since I left. Do you know of anything like this happening before?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, never. And because I haven’t, even though our data library
confirms your identity, I’m not convinced that your arrival here is
accidental. You know we are in the midst of a rebellion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I didn’t know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, a rebellion that will change everything and bring down the Empire
of Dethra if it isn’t stopped soon. It’s a rebellion of the inferior class
against the superior, slaves against the free. How do you feel about that
Ramsey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I admit I don’t like the idea of slavery and it was not allowed by
the government of my time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s right, it wasn’t. And guess what happened. Anarchy took over
before the end of the next generation. Famine and disease and ignorance
resulted. We lost much through the second age of darkness. It took a long time
for mankind to become healthy again. We had world peace for more than four
hundred years, and now the hard-won order is being shattered by the arrogance of
reprobate Menials. They poison the minds of others and we are losing hold of the
Era of Peace. Everyone must fall into one of two categories Ramsey, categories
that you may not accept. You may even be here to bring down the Empire. Are
you?&quot; Tai-Po looked at a monitor near Ramsey.</p>
<p>&quot;No. No, I’m not here for political reasons. It’s just a
terrible accident. My crew is dead and I suppose I should be too.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey turned melancholy. She had lost her soldiers and everything that was
familiar to her, including her family and friends.</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t know what’s happened to the world and I will leave the
politics to the politicians. I always have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems you are not lying. Still, I am not sure about you yet. You are
a soldier, an officer who’s led successful military campaigns for political
power.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-Po noted the elevation of Ramsey’s vital signs reflected in the monitor
along with the intensity that he doubted she could keep out of her eyes even if
she wanted to. She was really a remarkable specimen. The only thing that kept
her from being beautiful was her dark skin. That and the fact that if she was
standing she would be taller than he was.</p>
<p>He projected, &quot;You don’t like me do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is mutual Ramsey, so you won’t be surprised about what I
have decided.&quot; A flash of Tai-Po’s grin warned her that she was not going
to like his decision. &quot;I will remove your restraints but not until you’ve
been given the collar of a Menial. You will be my slave and if you please me, I
will let you live. I will reconsider your life on a daily basis.&quot;</p>
<p>The elder was not disappointed at the lack of fear in her eyes because he was
anticipating the pleasure of giving her pain until hatred turned to fear, and
then he would kill her. She might have been a superior woman in her time, but
her time was long gone.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>The warmth of the morning sun became unpleasant as the day wore on and
believing herself to be isolated while she worked in the palace garden, Ramsey
stripped down to her loincloth. For three days Major Ramsey had worn the black
metal ring of a slave around her neck. She had learned that Tai-Po could cause
her to drop to her knees in pain by merely pressing a black spot on his
bracelet. He teased her with it, sometimes making her drop for no reason other
than his whim. At night he threatened her with death.</p>
<p>'So this is the future', Ramsey thought with disgust. 'People abusing
people.' She was glad that she had not had children. She had no descendents to
be a part of this monstrous atrocity.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly and Laren was learning how to lose herself in the simple
tasks assigned to her. She had not weeded a garden since she was a teenager at
her grandmother’s ranch. She remembered and let her fingers play in the dark
soil enjoying the texture. She loved the smell of the earth. Earth. Ha! Strange
how good it feels to laugh even when my life is over. This is no longer earth,
it is Dethra, Laren thought bitterly.</p>
<p>Inside the palace Empress Sarika was losing patience with one of her Menials.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean you can’t fix the biosystem today? It’s positively
awful in here and I want it fixed by this evening. Get more slaves to help if
you need to but do it quickly Talbert.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’ll do everything in my power Empress, but the system is ancient. I
can’t find the schematics anywhere and the data library shows completely
different wiring than what it actually has. Nobody does this kind of thing
anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Talbert stopped when he realized he was whining and from the corner of his
eye he could she the enchanting features of the Empress take on a pink glow.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ll keep at it Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Now go.&quot; Sarika allowed her personal slaves to place a cool
compress on her brow and fan her while she sipped her favorite ice tea. She just
began to feel better when a slave announced that Elder Tai-Po sought an audience
with her. She waved away the compress and fans.</p>
<p>&quot;I will receive him.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-Po entered with his usual fanfare, elegant robes flowing behind him. When
he reached Sarika he got down on one knee, smoothed his goatee and placed a
lingering kiss over the ring on her right hand.</p>
<p>Sarika inquired, &quot;What concerns you that couldn’t wait until the
council meeting in the morning Elder?&quot;</p>
<p>It had been one week since her mother’s death and still Sarika had not
softened to him, treating him with the same formality as the other elders. The
Empress had not revealed who her mate was to be and his sureness that her vision
had been of him was beginning to wane. He had already earned a terrible
afterlife to get her. He would not allow anyone else to have her and he had
decided to pressure her into accepting him.</p>
<p>&quot;More attacks from runaways Empress. I need your approval to use level
four nerve gas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that would contaminate the area for years, would it not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. But the renegade Menials have managed to make an antidote for the
level three agent. They are approaching the boundary of the Holy Estate. It’s
either the gas or the fire laser from one of our few workable aircraft. Either
way there will be long lasting effects on the environment.&quot; Her spiritual
training was extreme and demanded that she protect the environment. How could
she make the decision to act?</p>
<p>He noticed her look of pained indecision and his small spirit was glad.</p>
<p>&quot;Empress, I long to help you with this. I would give anything to make
this easier for you…. Have you considered making me the Protector of Dethra?
You must know by now that I care for you very deeply.&quot; He wanted to say
more but he knew anything more would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>&quot;I have considered many things, Elder.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika felt sick. Her vision of the dark woman with the blue eyes made little
sense and before long she would have to take a mate. Her body itself would
demand it. How unfortunate that Tai-Po was the best candidate. She had never
liked him. His manipulations and harsh nature were not lost on her. But she did
not have to give in to him today.</p>
<p>&quot;I will consider your words Elder Tai-Po, and I will leave the decision
about how to retaliate against the runaways for tomorrow. We will discuss it
further with the rest of the elders during Council. In the meantime dispatch our
crafts to blast sound waves. That will keep them from advancing too
quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>She was dismissing him again and he barely managed to hide his rage. She
would not be able to put him off much longer. In two weeks she would celebrate
her eighteenth birthday and the ritual of womanhood would bring on an
irresistible drive to mate. The last empress who refused to mate had gone insane
and killed herself. She will not say yes to me now but soon she will be begging
me to take her. Who else would she choose? None of the other elders will compete
with me any more. Her choice is simple. She must mate with me and make me the
Protector of Dethra or die. With that thought Tai-Po’s rage left him and he
offered the Empress a genuine smile that almost made him handsome before taking
his leave.</p>
<p>Sarika yearned to be free from the responsibilities that lay heavily on her
shoulders. The relief she found in a cool bath was only temporary and again
feeling out of sorts she wandered to the balcony where she let her mind drift
until her eyes settled on the lone figure of a Menial working in the garden.
Rising from the ground laughing, the slave removed what little clothing she
wore, standing tall and naked in the bright sunlight. Her skin glistened with
the sheen of perspiration, her magnificent form marred only by the black collar
around her neck. She glanced up and Sarika felt a jolt pass through her. 'Those
eyes. By all that exists in the universe and beyond, it is my vision in the
flesh.' And then her vision dove cleanly into the sacred pond. Rising quickly to
the surface her long arms sliced through the water and her body glided smoothly
away until the definition of her remarkably muscled frame could no longer be
seen, only to reach the edge and turn to swim back again. Not daring to take her
eyes from the dark-haired woman, Sarika uncharacteristically yelled for her
slave.</p>
<p>&quot;Celeste, come quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>And Celeste came quickly to her. &quot;Yes Empress?&quot;</p>
<p>Nodding her chin to the pool below she demanded, &quot;Who is that slave in
the pond?&quot;</p>
<p>Celeste gasped at the sacrilege unfolding below. Only the Empress was allowed
to enter the sacred pond where she offered her morning prayers. &quot;Her name
is Ramsey and she belongs to Elder Tai-Po, Empress. She’s new to the palace
and obviously has not been told about the sacred water. I will tell
her.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika motioned for Celeste to be still, her cheeks blushed. &quot;No, just
bring her to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As you wish, Empress,&quot; she responded, and made her way across the
royal suite and down in the ancient elevator that made sounds of protest she had
learned to ignore.</p>
<p>When she reached the garden she was relieved to find Ramsey out of the water
and dressing. The slave was tall and the way she turned and looked directly at
her caused Celeste to wish that she were not alone with her.</p>
<p>&quot;The Empress has summoned you. Please follow me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? The Empress? What does she want with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You just swam in her sacred pond.&quot; Celeste was pleased that Ramsey
was willing to follow her. &quot;But I don’t think she wants to punish
you.&quot; Celeste recalled the expression on Empress Sarika’s face as she
watched Ramsey swim and in all her years with the young woman she had never seen
that particular expression before. She did not look angry exactly. &quot;I don’t
know, maybe she is curious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So when I meet her should I bow or something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and do not look directly into her eyes. Do whatever she says
without question. She holds the spirit of The Source and you must show that you
respect both her sacredness and her authority.&quot;</p>
<p>Seeing the look of astonishment that played quickly across Ramsey’s face,
Celeste felt a twinge of pity for her.</p>
<p>&quot;It is true, isn’t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What’s true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That you come from a place so far away that you are ignorant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t like being called ignorant and I’m getting enlightened real
fast. Tell me, does the Empress give you much pain?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, never. And you mustn’t talk about pain, especially around the
Empress. She doesn’t like it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well now, that makes two of us&quot;, laughed Ramsey.</p>
<p>Celeste felt trouble brewing. Ramsey had the temperament of a runaway.
Nevertheless, she did as she was instructed and brought her to stand before the
Empress who waited for Ramsey to bow before addressing her.</p>
<p>Ramsey had never met an empress before and did not know where to put her
hands and she finally looked at Celeste for help. Celeste mouthed the word
'bow'. Ramsey’s dark hair brushed the floor as she bowed elegantly.</p>
<p>Sarika sighed with relief. &quot;Tell me your name slave.&quot; Her voice
wavered and she wished the woman could look at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Ramsey. Major Laren Ramsey your Highness.&quot; She let her eyes rest
on the delicate fingers that grasped the arms of a chair barely small enough for
the woman in front of her.</p>
<p>&quot;You may call me Empress Sarika. Or just Empress. You have an unusual
name. I have traveled the world and never seen hair or eye color like yours. And
you form words strangely. Where were you born Major Laren Ramsey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Texas. Empress, please call me Ramsey.&quot; The Empress had a soothing
voice and she wanted to match the sounds with her expressions. Ramsey thought it
was awkward, not being able to look at her directly.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me Ramsey, where in the universe is Texas?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not that it matters much, but didn’t Tai-Po tell you anything about
me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Elder Tai-Po didn’t. Should he have?&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly Ramsey was looking into her eyes. Sarika descended into clear blue
stillness and felt as though she was in deep spiritual meditation. Radiant
warmth filled her. She had never before seen eyes as exquisite as this, nor felt
such a welcome connection to another person, let alone a Menial.</p>
<p>Ramsey was surprised that the Empress was so young. The tone of her voice did
not match her youth. And her eyes were hypnotic. Ramsey felt drawn to her and
the strength of it startled her to anger. This young woman was considered to be
holy yet she ruled over an evil empire. And that made her evil.</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t think you’ve had anyone from Texas in Dethra before
Empress, I thought the novelty of it would have been mentioned to you.&quot;</p>
<p>The sarcastic flavor was not lost on Sarika who snapped back as the stillness
in Ramsey’s eyes was devoured by a hostile flare. No one had dared look at her
so before. She was loath to say what came next but knew she must.</p>
<p>&quot;Watch yourself slave and avert your eyes from mine.&quot; Ramsey
clenched her jaw but obeyed the young empress. &quot;You’re arrogant and would
not last long with Elder Tai-Po. It’s a blessing for you that I claim you for
my own.&quot; She scribbled a note and handed it to Celeste. &quot;Take this to
the Elder and tell him that my decision is final.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Empress, the Elder will.…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is no longer the concern of the Elder. My message will be enough
Celeste.&quot;</p>
<p>Celeste brooded in the elevator. Trouble was brewing all right. This slave
would not do for the Empress. She did not even belong in the palace.</p>
<p>Sarika dismissed the remaining slaves except Ramsey who was struggling with
the idea of being claimed by the young woman, empress or not. Sensing Ramsey’s
distress Sarika rose.</p>
<p>&quot;Kneel before me Ramsey.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey kept her eyes averted from the petit empress but remained standing. No
one had dared defy her this way before.</p>
<p>&quot;You became mine the moment you entered the sacred pond. Now
kneel.&quot;</p>
<p>Still Ramsey stood and it was Sarika who shook slightly. She had to establish
her authority now or Ramsey would be no good to her and she was sure that the
magnificent person who defied her was the key that would help her find her mate,
although she realized that Ramsey did not know it. Before her mother died she
told her to listen to the counsel of the dark woman of the vision. She was
willing to listen but only after she knew she could trust her. She used her most
commanding tone against the resistance of the tall woman.</p>
<p>&quot;Kneel Ramsey.&quot;</p>
<p>Watching the still body she experienced desperation for the first time in her
young life. She pointed an arm toward her slave and her finger touched the black
spot on her bracelet. Ramsey fell solidly to her knees, gasping in shock at the
shriveling, burning pain consuming her.</p>
<p>Sarika raised her chin and removed her finger from her bracelet. A shudder of
empathy passed through her.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn’t like doing that. Obey me from now on and I will never have
to do it again.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey filled her lungs with air while the searing pain began to subside. She
had learned her lesson and would do her best to obey her new owner. She had
thought nothing could hurt worse than Tai-Po’s torture but now she knew there
was worse torment at the hands of her new owner.</p>
<p>Sarika knew it would be several minutes before Ramsey could stand. She placed
her hand on the olive-skinned cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you do what I say?&quot; There was regret in her face but Ramsey
could not look into her eyes and did not see it.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes-- Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika touched the silky black hair in a comforting gesture and knew that she
was the one seeking comfort. She hoped her new slave did not force her to use
the collar again. It was positively awful. And the growing need she felt to look
into her eyes a second time was distressing. The attraction and the alarming
power of it confused her. Forcing herself to step away from the slave, Sarika
chose to lighten her mood.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me what kind of abilities you have, besides gardening and
swimming.&quot;</p>
<p>Pushing humiliation aside, Ramsey answered her new owner.</p>
<p>&quot;I’m a military officer and a pretty good pilot, not too bad with
computerized electronics and I make great chili. By the way, your elevators and
cooling system could use some repair.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika gaped. &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can read all about me in the library I’ve been told.&quot;</p>
<p>Walking to her work desk Sarika touched several places on it's top and began
to read aloud: &quot;Ramsey, Laren Justice… Major, United States of America
Airforce. Born November 26, 1992 AD and died December 2, 2020.... Led several
successful missions against the Nation of China before her death at the age of
28 while commanding a craft that collided with an asteroid….&quot; Sarika
stopped reading and stared at Ramsey. &quot;Very funny&quot;, she said without
humor. &quot;What is your true name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's it Empress.&quot; Hoping to avoid another dose of pain, Ramsey
made a suggestion. &quot;Please, talk to Dr. Holis and she’ll confirm it. So
could Elder Tai-Po if he would. He’s the one that found me half dead after my
ship crashed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you expect me to believe that you’re nine hundred and sixty-three
years old?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I’m about as old as Methuselah. I know I look younger don’t
I?&quot; She wished the Empress would tell her to look at her so she could see
her sincerity. She did not.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, talk with the doctor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will slave. If you are lying you will regret it and if you aren’t,
then Elder Tai-Po will regret withholding the information.&quot;</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Wishing she had not missed the inspiring calm of noon meditation, Dr
Cara Holis popped a couple of serenity pills into her mouth before responding to
the summons. And still she was anxious, sitting in front of her young ruler
while telling her just about everything she knew about Major Laren Ramsey.
Chattering as if they were the best of friends, she knew that if her nervousness
was annoying to her it must be even more so to the Empress.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes indeed, Ramsey was quite the bloody mess when I first laid eyes on
her, what with broken bones sticking out everywhere.&quot; She paused only to
take a breath. &quot;But she healed very nicely, wouldn’t you say so Empress
Sarika? I am so sorry for rambling but I…&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika boldly grazed her eyes across Ramsey. &quot;It’s all right Dr.
Holis, I agree with your assessment.&quot; She admired the glow of health
shining from the strong figure. So different from others, and the difference
thrilled her.</p>
<p>Ramsey could not see where the eyes of the Empress lingered but the sultry
gaze may as well have been a caress. Once nicknamed Major Machismo because of
her physical prowess and stoic demeanor, Ramsey now wondered at the warmth
flooding her. Was it embarrassment? She thought that it must be, and had to
marshal her will to keep from telling the young woman to stop whatever it was
she was doing to her, empress or not. Instead, she spoke to the nervously
fidgeting doctor.</p>
<p>&quot;Cara, what convinced you that I am Major Ramsey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Elder convinced me. I mean, I didn’t really believe you were from
the twenty-first century until Elder Tai-Po said he personally checked the data.
And everything about you fit someone from that Era. Your dark skin, hair and
height. Haven’t you noticed we all have brown hair and eye color? I mean all
except the Empress?&quot; Cara tilted her head toward the colorful Empress with
dazzling light auburn hair and green eyes.</p>
<p>Cara was physician to the Holy Empress and knew her unusual coloring was due
to the unique mating process that did not just require the joining of two people
in the usual manner, but a medical procedure similar to cloning. Hair and eye
color, along with telepathic kinetic abilities were thereby passed down from
mother to daughter. An Empress always inherited more from her mother than her
father.</p>
<p>The rest of humanity, what was left after the Second Age of Darkness,
procreated the usual way until they shared a similar coloring of their own. The
only thing differentiating them was whether they wore the bracelet of a Ruler or
the collar of a Menial. Rulers were born to Rulers and Menials to Menials. Elder
Tai-Po broke the pattern by putting a collar on Ramsey.</p>
<p>Cara continued her reasoning, her audience oblivious to the pause. &quot;Yes,
when the Elder confirmed the Library’s data then it made sense. You were
listed as dead nine hundred and thirty-five years ago because somehow you
crashed here. You said you must’ve entered a time distortion didn’t you?--
Ramsey?&quot;</p>
<p>It seemed that the time-traveler stared at the Empress. And if she was not
mistaken her Empress was staring at Ramsey. Cara was shocked that the Empress
allowed the intimacy and waited silently, feeling the tension.</p>
<p>Ramsey wondered what force caused her to look unguarded at the young woman.
The Empress saw into her soul, and knowing that she also saw into the soul of
the Empress paradoxically relieved her embarrassment.</p>
<p>Sarika sank again into the blue depths of her slave’s eyes. She believed.
Ramsey was different from all others; she was from another time. And she knew
Ramsey was as confused about it as everyone else. Perhaps she and her mother had
even caused her to be here. Some things, she knew, could not be explained. She
respected the mystical elements. Before she died her mother said this woman
would be her counselor, but what could someone from nine centuries past tell her
that she did not already know?</p>
<p>Ramsey felt a growing desire to speak to the Empress. &quot;Trust me. I will
always tell you the truth,&quot; she finally said.</p>
<p>Sarika saw the gleaming white smile and was captivated. Her chin thrust
forward.</p>
<p>&quot;I do.&quot;</p>
<p>The brief statements were meant as promises and sealed a bond between them.
The intensity of the moment lessened when Ramsey looked away. Sarika was amazed
that she felt the presence of the newcomer so forcefully. Turning to Cara, she
willed her rapidly beating heart to calm.</p>
<p>&quot;Why wasn’t I told about Ramsey days ago when she was found?&quot;</p>
<p>Cara had been waiting for this question. &quot;The Elder was in charge,
Empress. I didn’t think it was my place.&quot;</p>
<p>She wanted to add that the Elder had ordered her to keep Ramsey’s identity
a secret but she did not intend to say anything Tai-Po would undoubtedly punish
her for later.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika focused on Ramsey again, hoping the thrilling stimulation she felt at
doing so was not projected to her slave. She could not always keep sudden
responses from being telekinetically projected.</p>
<p>&quot;Elder Tai-Po chose to make you his slave. Why.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He said he didn’t trust me since no one has been known to time travel
before and I know how to wage military campaigns. But most of all, I think he
wanted a target for his bracelet.&quot; Ramsey fingered her black neck collar.</p>
<p>Sarika preferred that the Rulers use the bracelet only as a last resort for
disciplining Menials and this was not the first time she it been implied that
Tai-Po used pain liberally. Nothing could be done about Tai-Po unless another
Ruler willing to report it witnessed the misuse. She was sorry that she herself
had to discipline Ramsey with the bracelet. She had never felt such a mixture of
distress and relief when Ramsey responded to the pain. Menials could not be
allowed to ignore the authority over them, no matter how much one may like a
slave, and pain induced by the collar was an effective way to insure obedience.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the collar is worn, it can never be removed. Did you know
this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. But I’m not surprised.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey was a realist and thought nothing about Dethra could surprise her
anymore, no matter how abhorrent.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it’s for the best that Elder Tai-Po made you a slave since
you’re a foreigner and therefore could never be a Ruler. Everyone must be one
or the other. To allow someone to live among us who is neither would disturb the
order we strive to maintain. Since it is my duty as the Holy Empress to keep
order, you will remain my slave, but know that I will be good to you. I will
keep in mind that your adjustment is a process. And you will keep in mind that
my authority is absolute.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey had no other choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika gracefully fanned her face.</p>
<p>&quot;This evening you will tell me what the world used to be like.&quot; She
hoped the biosystem would be fixed by then. &quot;In the meantime Dr. Holis can
show you how to access the library. I want you to learn all you can about the
world as it is, since this is your home now. And I will consider what work would
be best for you.&quot;</p>
<p>She dismissed the two women and contemplated the course of action she should
take against Elder Tai-Po for keeping Ramsey a secret. She wanted to make it a
harsh response but she needed him to help subdue the rebels, so it would be only
a token. But perhaps for the proud elder, making him forfeit his chair at her
right hand during council would be painful enough to make him think twice before
keeping something important from her again.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Light from the clear ceiling of the library shone down onto Ramsey’s
head making blue highlights. She could not gain access to all the information in
the library but what she learned about the history of the world deepened her
grief.</p>
<p>The war with China had ended with a nuclear holocaust that nearly desolated
the earth. High tech systems were largely wiped out and radiation poisoned the
food and water along with most of the people. Tai-Po was right. Sickness and
anarchy reigned for a long time. Those who were strong hoarded resources and
enslaved others to work for them.</p>
<p>A religion surfaced that was based on purifying the environment and
establishing order. Status was determined by birth. Religion provided leadership
for government and united the world under the office of the Holy Empress. But in
the last few days the dissatisfaction of some of the slaves had grown into a
rebellion that reached the borders of the Holy Land and would soon threaten the
palace of the Empress.</p>
<p>Ramsey wondered what armaments were being used in this conflict but learned
nothing other than that the Rulers had aircraft while the rebels did not. This
advantage alone should have given victory to the Rulers long ago. Ramsey’s
military mind was puzzled.</p>
<p>She learned that there were no emperors, only empresses. It seemed that only
the females of the line of Dethra had the ability to impart cleansing to others,
and to the environment. It was remarkable that the empresses resembled each
other so much. Empress Vilell, Sarika’s mother, had been the twelfth, her life
cut short by an unknown illness. Her holographic image revealed a beautiful
woman in the prime of life. She died just a week ago, explaining the black robe
that Empress Sarika wore. Her death also made Sarika the thirteenth empress of
Dethra, an unlucky number according to superstition. And twelve had not been so
fortunate either, Ramsey thought.</p>
<p>The sunlight pouring through the ceiling began to cause her discomfort and
Ramsey decided she had spent enough time in the library for one day. She got up
to leave and noticed the holographic screen at the next booth. It clearly
represented the plot design for a temperature control unit, probably the one for
the palace. Ramsey spoke to the man who watched the hologram with a frustrated
expression.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been studying this design long?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All day and it still makes no sense. The actual system is not put
together like this. The colors and connections are different and I can’t see
how to fix it. Oh, I’m Talbert by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey noted the slave collar her wore and wondered how severely he would be
punished if he could not fix the system soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Ramsey. Pleased to meet you.&quot; She made a quick decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I know how to work on systems like this and I’d be glad to help, not
only for the cooler air but to keep your owner from giving you the bracelet
treatment. Who owns you?&quot; If he said it was Tai-Po she had no doubt he
would be cruelly punished.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;</p>
<p>Talbert was willing to kiss the feet of this darkly majestic woman if she
could help him fix the biosystem.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ll take any help you can give, but not because the Empress would
cause me that kind of pain. She never uses the bracelet on me. Actually, they
say she’s never used the bracelet on anyone. But I don’t want her to be
unhappy with me either. She can still make my life miserable, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey did not want to tell him that the Empress had used the bracelet to
make an impression on her earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;</p>
<p>Talbert showed her the biosystem control panels and she went to work,
replacing coils and thin fiber wiring using magnifying lenses. She explained the
layout to Talbert who was fascinated, thinking Ramsey was either making a mess
of things or she was a genius. They turned on the repaired system and the air
surrounding them quickly became more comfortable to breathe. He decided she was
a genius.</p>
<p>Ramsey felt a surge of relief. &quot;That should hold her for awhile. The
next thing to go will be the microprocessors. We’ll have to make some if you
don’t have any on stock. You know, this isn’t too different from my
time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha. What are you talking about, you’re younger than me, and this
system is ancient.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean it’s not too different than the systems where I used to
live.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really? I didn’t know there were other biosystems around. Where are
you from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Texas&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never heard of it Ramsey, but I heard you came from some place pretty
far away and that’s why you look different. Does everyone from Texas have
black hair?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blue eyes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. There’s, variety back home, but Texas is pretty far away all
right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds like you miss it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do. I’d give anything to go back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, when I tell the Empress that you’re the one who fixed the
biosystem, she just might be willing to grant you a visit back to Texas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Somehow Talbert, I just don’t think so.&quot;</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Time was going by too fast for Sarika. She needed to find a way to
stop the rebels with the least amount of damage to the environment possible, and
she had to choose a mate before her birthday. The two tasks seemed impossible.
Her evening prayers were filled with pleas for help and guidance from The
Source, and the benevolent spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>When she heard audible voices in response she thought it was the result of
taking too many serenity pills after meeting Ramsey. It sounded like her mother,
telling her to listen with her heart. She waited for more but there was only the
rumble of her stomach making her need for food known. She was not happy to have
more mystery presented to her when it was answers that she needed.</p>
<p>Immediately after dining Sarika called for Ramsey.</p>
<p>&quot;Talbert tells me the Palace has you to thank for fixing the biosystem.
Thank you Ramsey.&quot;</p>
<p>Remembering to keep her eyes averted, Ramsey bowed gracefully. &quot;My
pleasure Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When we are alone like we are now, you have my permission to call me
Sarika. Did you enjoy the Library?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enjoy is not the word. But I caught up on the basics of world history
over the past nine hundred years. It seems no one won the war. Not Asia and not
North America.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika noted Ramsey’s sadness. &quot;The holocaust was terrible. You’ve
lost your family and your friends and you wonder if they suffered. I’m sorry.
I too have lost someone close to me recently.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your mother, I read. And I’m sorry for your loss Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sarika, I insist. Now sit and tell me about your life.&quot; Sarika
patted the cushion beside her.</p>
<p>Ramsey did not want to like the young woman before her. She reminded herself
that she was a prisoner of sorts, and the Empress was the head jailer. She
reminded herself of the bracelet on the wrist of the woman and the collar around
her own neck. So when she sat next to her and reminisced about her past, she
pretended that she was alone and Sarika was not a part of her world. She lost
herself in the telling and forgot that she was speaking.</p>
<p>She remembered her dreams of wanting to be free and fly like the wind. Riding
horses on the ranch her family had owned for generations. The face of her
brother as they wrestled in the mud, his freckles disappearing. The hard work of
branding cattle. The lessons about reaping what you sow, and if something was
worth doing it was worth giving it your all-out best. The beauty of the big blue
sky on a summer day that brought the family together for picnics. The excitement
of summer storms and the first snow of winter. Cold hands, breaking the ice on
the water troughs. Newborn animals. Togetherness. And the love of freedom.
To have your own land and sit under your own tree. She remembered.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on…. Continue Ramsey.&quot; Sarika was enthralled by the beautiful
prose that came from her slave’s mouth. She wanted to hear more of the rich
voice, even if the ideas were strange. &quot;You really rode a horse? And did
everyone sit under their own tree?&quot;</p>
<p>Startled by the voice and the hand on her thigh, Ramsey turned and looked at
Sarika. She was lovely, leaning toward her with eyes wide and lips smiling in an
altogether expectant pose. Ramsey’s stomach knotted.</p>
<p>&quot;Not everyone Empress.&quot; Ramsey turned her eyes away.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I want you to look at me when we’re alone, and call me
Sarika.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey glanced at the hand on her leg and up to Sarika’s face, which had
taken on a slight pout. She was really just a child who was used to getting her
way. But a dangerous child, Ramsey knew.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, Sarika.&quot;</p>
<p>The Empress beamed with pleasure at hearing Ramsey say her name while looking
in her eyes. Ramsey was startled, pleasure coursing through her and settling for
a tingling, agonizing second between her legs. A child with a woman’s body,
Ramsey amended. And Sarika was the first to break the contact, removing both her
hand and her eyes from her slave, a look of shock on her face.</p>
<p>Oh shit! , Ramsey thought, knowing Sarika had seen the brief sexual response
in her eyes. She felt humiliated again, a developing pattern she was determined
to change.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I go now?&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika had just realized the nature of her attraction to Ramsey and although
she was unaccustomed to the new thoughts forming in her mind, she was quickly
adjusting. It was not forbidden for an empress to take a woman for a lover, just
unusual. Even more unusual if the woman was a Menial but she was sure there was
a precedent for such a relationship somewhere. And if not, she would set one.</p>
<p>She looked up at Ramsey with new eyes, sure of herself for the first time
since becoming Empress.</p>
<p>&quot;No you can’t go yet. I still have some things on my mind, and you
will stay until I’m satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika wore confidence well. Too well, Ramsey thought. And suddenly she felt
like prey for the young woman.</p>
<p>&quot;What satisfaction can I give you?&quot;</p>
<p>Now she purposefully projected her desire and ran her hand up Ramsey’s arm,
cool skin rubbing warm until her hand found the slave collar at her neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me traveler, did you leave behind a mate?&quot; Pressing herself
against solid warmth, she felt her slave’s growing agitation and Sarika’s
confidence wavered.</p>
<p>Ramsey’s skin tingled everywhere Sarika touched her and she was having
difficulty thinking instead of feeling the delicious and yet unwelcome
sensations.</p>
<p>&quot;No. I have no mate.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika moved the back of her hand to caress her neck and jaw.</p>
<p>&quot;But you were a soldier. Surely you have experienced sex.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ramsey gasped and when Sarika placed her other hand on her
thigh again, she stopped it from moving to more sensitive places by placing her
own hand on top.</p>
<p>&quot;Sex with a woman?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey silently cursed herself for telling the Empress that she would always
tell her the truth. &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well I’ve never had a lover. You will be my first Ramsey, this is the
satisfaction I need from you.&quot;</p>
<p>She touched her lips to the olive-hued skin at Ramsey’s throat, causing her
distraught slave to leap from the cushion.</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika was confused again. &quot;No? But you want me. I can feel your
desire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You felt my body responding, that’s all. I don’t love you, you don’t
love me and I don’t want to be your lover.&quot; Seeing the look of fury on
Sarika’s face, Ramsey prepared herself for the pain of the collar.</p>
<p>&quot;You dare defy me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mean to be defiant. I’m telling you the truth. I told you I
would always tell you the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Anger departed from the Empress when she saw the anxiety in her slave’s
eyes and the brief thought of using the bracelet again was quickly rejected.
Feelings that Ramsey inspired in her were almost out of control. And now she
felt despair. If she felt this awful before the ritual of womanhood she did not
want to imagine how she would feel in less than two weeks when the irresistible
urge to mate took her over.</p>
<p>&quot;Why won’t you love me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You rule over me. I’m your slave. I’m not free to love you.&quot;</p>
<p>She was the Empress and she would never beg although at that moment, looking
at her splendid slave, she wished that she could. Her chin rose and she tore her
eyes from the object of her yearning.</p>
<p>&quot;Go then. Just go.&quot;</p>
<p>When Ramsey left she took another pill. Just before she drifted into sleep
she heard a voice from the Source once more.</p>
<i>
<p>'Why do you hold on so tight to what you could so easily let go of?'</p>
</i>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Without feeling rested Sarika arose and went half-heartedly to her
morning prayers, numbly noting that the elevator did not offer it’s usual
grumbling on her way down to the sacred pond.</p>
<p>When she got there the sight of Ramsey sleeping on the ground greeted her.
She shook her slave and then put her fingers to her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Quiet, slave. I don’t want to alert the whole palace to our presence
here. What are you doing here anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey rubbed her eyes. &quot;I have no other place to sleep since you
claimed me yesterday.&quot; She watched as Sarika let the robe fall from her
shoulders to the ground. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; She clutched the robe
at Sarika’s feet and pulled it back up to her shoulders, bringing her breast
to naked breast with the Empress since the robe remained open.</p>
<p>Sarika was rewarded with that tingling current she could not get out of her
mind since she first felt it the night before. She placed her hands at the back
of Ramsey’s neck and began to pull the dark head down for a much-desired kiss.</p>
<p>Ramsey knew what was happening and was powerless to stop it. The Empress
pushed inexperienced lips against hers and the world spun around them.</p>
<p>Sarika heard herself moan when Ramsey took control of the kiss. Yes. This is
what she needed. She had never felt so alive. The scent of the garden was potent
but none of the blossoms smelled as good as Ramsey. The texture of her hot mouth
was exciting beyond anything else she had ever experienced. She wanted to feel
more of her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she groaned when Ramsey pulled away only to claim her lips
again in an even deeper kiss.</p>
<p>The sound of shattering glass broke the lover’s passionate reverie. Ramsey
pushed Sarika to the ground and covered her with her own body, inadvertently
pushing the air out of the smaller woman’s lungs.</p>
<p>&quot;Who’s there?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey looked around the perimeter of the garden. No one answered and Sarika
struggled to move.</p>
<p>Once she caught her breath she decided she liked their position and wrapped
her arms around Ramsey’s waist.</p>
<p>&quot;No one’s here but us. I’m very happy that you changed your
mind.&quot; She began to taste the flesh of neck above her.</p>
<p>Ramsey felt the heat of passion stir again but this time she was prepared.
&quot;There is an attraction, I admit. But it’s not love and I haven’t
changed my mind.&quot; Ramsey rolled to the side and stood away from the little
beauty. &quot;It won’t happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>Deciding she did not have time to push it, Sarika tossed the robe aside
again, standing boldly before her stubborn slave. With a tone befitting a woman
who was used to being obeyed, she flung out her instructions.</p>
<p>&quot;Your sleeping arrangements will not be overlooked anymore. From now on
you will spend your nights in my bed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you going to sleep?&quot;</p>
<p>Not bothering to respond, Sarika dove into the water. Ramsey knew she had
been dismissed and left to ask Celeste where she could find some breakfast,
feeling as though she had no more control over her life.</p>
<p>Sarika let the water cool her until she was ready to meditate. Her morning
prayers began with more than the usual thankfulness and ended with the
never-ending need for guidance. The benediciton was odd. &quot;I am
willing to listen, mother. But I am going to have Ramsey, counselor or
not.&quot;</p>
<p>Her breakfast was not appetizing and she ate little of it. Her personal
slaves wondered if she was ill but she assured them she was not and asked
Celeste to get her council robe. Celeste knew that it was time and had it ready.
She let Celeste dress her. It had been more than a week since she wore something
other than the black of mourning. Unfortunately the purple robe clashed with her
coloring and she defiantly added a long black scarf to match her mood before
leaving her suite.</p>
<p>Tai-Po stroked his goatee while he simmered with jealousy and anger. His
position in the council had been diminished and he no longer sat at the side of
the Empress. Worse than that, he witnessed the lovemaking between the Empress
and Ramsey in the garden. The Empress was giving to Ramsey what belonged to him.</p>
<p>Where was the fairness in life, he wondered. How could the Empress do this to
him? But it would change. The Ramsey bitch had thrown his plans back a bit, that
was all.</p>
<p>He stood with the eleven other elders when Sarika entered the hall, bowing
and speaking in unison with the others, greeting the Holy Empress.</p>
<p>Sarika let it be known that she was as committed as her mother before her, to
end the rebellion of the Menials but not at the expense of undo harm to the
environment. Level four gas was a last resort, and not the choice she wanted to
make today. She polled each elder for another plausible solution and one-by-one
they failed to provide anything useful. Finally she reached Tai-Po. And he put
in motion his revised plan.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is another solution. We have here at the Palace an expert
in weapons and military strategy, someone who could probably repair some of our
ancient weapons like she did the biosystem yesterday. Weapons that maim but
don't kill and won’t harm the environment. An ancient to restore what is
ancient.&quot;</p>
<p>The Elders looked to the Empress to explain what Tai-Po was talking about.</p>
<p>Sarika wondered why she hadn’t thought of it herself. Of course, Ramsey was
an expert in computerized electronics. &quot;Elder Tai-Po refers to Major Laren
Ramsey, someone he rescued from a crash just days ago. Her undeniable identity
is of someone who fought in the third world war, just before the nuclear
holocaust.&quot;</p>
<p>Astonished exclamations and questions erupted from the elders. Sarika quieted
them with a raised arm. &quot;What is important now is that she is the only one
who knows how to make the ancient weapons useful for us. Tai-Po may have the
right idea. But Ramsey is my slave and must be monitored by someone who knows
more about the weapons more than I do.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-Po was the first to offer. &quot;I would be glad to oversee Ramsey’s
work.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika hoped another elder would volunteer but the rest of the council
members agreed that Tai-Po was the most knowledgeable about the weapons of the
ancients.</p>
<p>&quot;So be it then. I will have Ramsey report to you Elder Tai-Po but I
expect a progress report at least twice a day and you can anticipate that I will
be making onsite appraisals at the garrison.&quot;</p>
<p>She had learned that she could not trust Tai-Po completely and she did not
want to hear that he was using the bracelet to torment Ramsey as he did when she
was his slave. But for now, she had little choice but to
give him his way.</p>
<p>Tai-Po showed his uneven teeth through a tight-lipped grin. &quot;May your
trust in me be fully regained Empress. Check whenever you like.&quot; His little
Celeste would let him know when she was coming to visit, he had no fear.</p>
