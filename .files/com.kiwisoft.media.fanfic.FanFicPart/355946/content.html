<!-- What Ever Happened To \ Part Three -->

<p>Holly sat in the bar off the lobby of the hotel, surrounded by her friends laughing and chatting about the old days. Yet her mind wasn't focused on the festivities. It was focused on the tall brunette she'd passed in the hallway earlier that evening. She didn't think it was possible but Whitney had grown even more attractive with the passing years. She'd been sitting alone in her room scanning through the program for tomorrow night's events when Joan called her. On the spur of the moment, Joan had managed to corral as many of the old gang as possible for an impromptu meeting.</p>
		<p>Holly was hesitant at first, not wanting to spend time with those individuals who had shut her out years before. Joan rambled off the names of the people who'd be there. None of the people in attendance were among those who had treated her badly. Holly eagerly agreed to join them.</p>
		<p>Holly sipped her drink as she continued telling her tale. "So Principal Skinner burst in, catching Joan, Selma, and I standing there in the middle of the boys' locker room. I wanted to die. "</p>
		<p>"I wanted to see what Freddy was hiding under his towel." Joan laughed.</p>
		<p>"Had I only known." Freddy winked.</p>
		<p>"Please! You turned four shades of red when you saw us," Holly interjected. "Where was I? Oh yeah, Joan and I were trying to hide behind what's-his-name, Kenny, the linebacker on the team. But not Selma. "</p>
		<p>"Don't rush the story. Get back to Kenny dropping his towel," Joan encouraged as the rest of the group snickered.</p>
		<p>"Oh my, even I have to admit that boy was blessed." Holly fanned herself. "When we tried to hide behind him, his towel dropped. He was so flustered."</p>
		<p>"I didn't mind," Joan confessed. "He had the tightest ass I'd ever seen. That's when Selma stepped up."</p>
		<p>"She handed him his towel like nothing had happened," Holly explained. "And started rambling off this spiel to Skinner about doing research for the school paper. She was so convincing I almost bought it."</p>
		<p>The crowd erupted in laughter. "What happened? Did he believe her?" Julie, Freddie's wife, asked eagerly.</p>
		<p>"He might have . . . but he knew that none of us were on the school paper." Holly rolled her emerald eyes in amusement. "We were suspended for three days. My parents were so mortified that they grounded me for an entire month."</p>
		<p>"That I remember," Freddie stated grimly. "Good thing they were clueless about half the stunts you and Selma pulled."</p>
		<p>"My parents were thrilled," Joan added. "Up until that point, I think they thought I was some kind of shrinking violet."</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah, that sounds like you, sweetie." Jake, Joan's husband, chuckled as he winked at her playfully.</p>
		<p>"You? A shrinking violet?" Holly snorted. "I had to stop you from grabbing Kenny's ass." This comment brought on another round of laughter as Joan blushed. "Whatever happened to Kenny, the tight-bunned linebacker?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know," Joan admitted.</p>
		<p>"He uhm . . . passed away," Freddie informed them sadly.</p>
		<p>There was a collective gasp. "How?" someone asked. "When?" someone else inquired.</p>
		<p>"A few years back." Freddie blinked shyly as he related the information. "We grew up next door to one another. We weren't close but our folks were. AIDS," he added solemnly.</p>
		<p>"AIDS?" Trisha said blankly. "So young. Damn proof that it's not a gay issue."</p>
		<p>"He was," Freddie countered simply. "He was gay."</p>
		<p>"Come on," Rex, another member of the group, argued. "The guy was going out with Whitney Ward. She was the most beautiful girl in school."</p>
		<p>Holly groaned at the statement, partially from the stupidity of it and partially in agreement with Rex's observation of Whitney's attributes. "I thought I was the most beautiful girl in school?" Trisha, Rex's high school sweetheart, teased him.</p>
		<p>"Present company excluded of course," Rex blurted out quickly.</p>
		<p>"Nice save, buddy," Holly teased him. The divorced father of two grimaced in embarrassment. "So I shouldn't tell you that I saw her today?" Holly taunted him. She watched in delight as her former male classmates looked at her eagerly. "And let me tell you, she grew up <i>nice</i>." She smiled warmly at the memory of Whitney smiling at her. It was almost flirtatious. She'd felt a pleasant jolt run through her body as they accidentally brushed against one another. As she was walking towards her room, she could have sworn she heard Whitney say her name. She shook her head, thinking it was just her overactive imagination.</p>
		<p>"She's here?" Rex inquired eagerly, bringing Holly back to the present. "Well, that doesn't do much for you married guys but as for Holly and me . . . " He winked at her playfully. "Who am I kidding?" He sighed. "I was never in her league. Plus she probably has a gigantic husband. Kenny certainly scared us off for all those years."</p>
		<p>"I feel so special all of a sudden," Trisha growled.</p>
		<p>"I'm just kidding," Rex apologized sincerely. "You were and still are the most beautiful girl in town."</p>
		<p>"Ahhh," the group teased with a collective sigh. Holly looked over at Joan and nodded. They both wondered if the two might get back together now that they were both single. </p>
		<p>"Well, now that Rex has graciously bowed out of the running, it's safe to tell you that Whitney's gay," Freddie informed them, adding a knowing smirk towards Holly.</p>
		<p>"How do you know?" Joan asked curiously.</p>
		<p>"Because Kenny lived on one side of my house and Whitney lived on the other side," Freddie informed them with a shrug.</p>
		<p>"Freddie used to peep at her," Rex added smugly.</p>
		<p>"You pervert," Holly chastised him. "Tell me everything."</p>
		<p>"I never actually saw her," Freddie confessed shyly.</p>
		<p>"You little liar," Rex said as he smacked him in the back of the head.</p>
		<p>"What was I supposed to say?" Freddie whined. "Sorry guys, but she caught me trying once and was smart enough to close the blinds after that."</p>
		<p>"I'm so glad we have girls." Julie sighed heavily.</p>
		<p>"I'm not. I don't trust that little Romeo next door." Freddie gritted his teeth.</p>
		<p>"He's five, dear," Julie said as she patted his arm reassuringly.</p>
		<p>"Sure, now," Freddie stammered in frustration.</p>
		<p>The crew laughed heartily as they teased Freddie. "Hold on, guys. I'm with Freddie on this one," Rex interrupted. "My girls are getting close to their teens. I'm terrified. What if they bring home someone like me?" he squeaked out fearfully. "Wait," he said as he reached inside his jacket pocket and retrieved his wallet.</p>
		<p>"Yes!" Holly squealed. "Pictures! Come on the rest of you." She waved her fingers in encouragement. "I just know you can't wait to set off my biological clock."</p>
		<p>"Well, if you insist." Joan beamed as she reached into her purse. The others frantically did the same, eager to show off their children.</p>
