<!-- Interludis Neanderthalensis \ Part One -->

<p>The bad guys had been vanquished--or at least contained so they
couldn't do any more damage until their beer induced browse through the paleolithic period
passed. The good guys--or rather good girl-- had been saved. Parker had been bonked. And
all was more or less right with the world.</p>

<p>Well, except for the fact that Buffy Summers was sniffing everything in sight, or at least
everything her friends allowed her to sniff. Willow caught her friend's arm, tugging her
back from a tall, well dressed figure who was undoubtedly either a professor or
administrator on campus with a gentle, &quot;Look over here, Buffy.&quot; She redirected
Buffy's attention to a flower growing near the sidewalk and the Slayer immediately bounded
over to it, dropping to her knees to cheerfully sniff the thing, while Willow hoped no one
they knew was anywhere in sight. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, she's certainly enthusiastic,&quot; Xander noted as he watched the
proceedings.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Giles added, one eyebrow climbing high on his forehead.</p>

<p>Willow just caught Buffy's hand and gently tugged her upright, with a coaxing, &quot;Come
on.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy bounced to her feet, leaning close to Willow to begin sniffing her eagerly. After a
couple of healthy inhalations, she screwed up her face in an expression of disgust.
&quot;Phaw...smoke...no like...&quot;</p>

<p>Xander and Giles both tensed in case they needed to step in to help Willow. After all,
they were dealing with a very primitive, rather unpredictable Slayer who could easily
break Willow Rosenberg in two should she lose her temper.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, well,&quot; Giles began as he carefully reached for Buffy's arm. After all,
Willow wasn't the only thing she was capable of breaking in half.</p>

<p>Buffy yanked her arm back and growled at her Watcher as she pressed against her best
friend's side. &quot;No,&quot; she snapped. &quot;Stay with girl...&quot; She wrapped an
arm around Willow's waist, hugging her hard enough to knock the air from her lungs.
&quot;Girl nice...smell bad, but nice...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think Willow's definitely got the inside track,&quot; Xander noted, his tone
disappointed. So far Buffy had shown absolutely no tolerance for anyone but her friend,
which was fast killing at least a half a dozen wild woman fantasies his brain had been
busy conjuring since first encountering this regressed version of Buffy. Which, if he was
honest, he had to admit was probably for the best considering the fate Parker the Slimebag
had received. Xander knew his head was hard, but he was pretty sure it wasn't <i>that</i>
hard.</p>

<p>Still gasping for air, the redhead wrapped an arm around her friend's shoulders.
&quot;That's me on the smelly, but nice inside track,&quot; she wisecracked as she tried
to gently loosen Buffy's overenthusiastic hold on her ribs.</p>

<p>Buffy let out a snuffling laugh, though it was unclear exactly what she found so funny. At
least she was a relatively happy Cro-Magnon.</p>

<p>The remaining distance to the dorms passed in companionable silence, which was fine by
Willow. She was too tired to talk, her lungs still felt seared from the heat and smoke,
and she just wasn't in the mood for conversation, not after watching Oz mooning after
another woman. She leaned against Buffy, who kept an arm around her waist. The Slayer
might not be at her most impressive on the mental front, but she was even more physically
supportive than normal and at that exact moment, that felt really good.</p>

<p>Giles and Xander both pulled up short at the door to the dorm room the girls shared while
Willow fumbled with the key, a process made more difficult by the fact that Buffy became
quite fascinated by the shiny, coppery doorknob and insisted on crouching down to watch
the process.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Giles said uncertainly when the young woman finally got the door open.
He noted the way Buffy was studying the lock. &quot;Are you certain about this?&quot; he
asked after a long beat.</p>

<p>Willow glanced down at her friend, then shrugged. &quot;It'll be okay,&quot; she assured
him, confident that Buffy would never hurt her. &quot;She's a little...&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy rushed inside the room, bounding onto her bed, where she began bouncing like a small
child, laughing in abandonment.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, a little...different right now,&quot; Willow allowed. &quot;But it's still
Buffy.&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer did a flip, then kept bouncing as she giggled, &quot;Fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She wouldn't hurt me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, well, yes...&quot; Giles said hesitantly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll bet her mattress felt the same way this morning.&quot; Xander's eyes tracked
the Slayer's up and down gyrations with wide eyes. He couldn't help it. Even Cave-Slayer
did naughty things to his hormones. &quot;And yet, there it is, getting flattened into a
pancake...although, I must say, I'm enjoying the process.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow sighed heavily as she noted Xander's response to Buffy's bouncing. What was it with
the male of the species? Apparently even Oz couldn't--</p>

<p>&quot;Girl not happy,&quot; Buffy broke into Willow's dark thoughts as she bounced from
the bed and landed lightly next to her friend.</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing,&quot; Willow insisted, startled by how quickly Buffy had picked up on
her moods.</p>

<p>Cave-Slayer frowned as she peered up at the other girl, studying her with feral intensity.
She reached up with a tentative hand, brushing her fingertips along Willow's brow.
&quot;Not happy,&quot; she said intently.</p>

<p>Giles noted the way Willow shifted uncomfortably from one foot to the other. &quot;Is
something wrong?&quot; he questioned with almost parental worry.</p>

<p>Willow instantly shook her head. &quot;I'm fine, really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you're sure,&quot; the former librarian said softly, sensing there was more to
the story, but hesitant to press. He'd been feeling increasingly cut off from their lives
since they'd defeated the mayor; as though he wasn't quite a part of the group anymore,
and he wasn't entirely certain why. It wasn't just the fact that he was out of a job, and
Buffy had broken her ties with the Watchers. It was something more. He just couldn't put
his finger on it. </p>

<p>Willow nodded, not noting the other man's brief distance.</p>

<p>&quot;You call if you need any help,&quot; Xander inserted, then nodded toward Buffy, who
was still staring up at Willow, studying her carefully. &quot;I mean with Cave-Slayer
there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll be fine,&quot; Willow assured them both. She was startled a moment later as
Buffy parroted her.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine.&quot; The Slayer pushed the two men out of the doorway, with a grumbled,
&quot;Go now,&quot; then slammed the door in their startled faces. </p>

<p>Willow couldn't restrain a chuckle at the expression on both Giles' and Xander's faces as
the door slammed shut.</p>

<p>Buffy noted the smile and grinned proudly. &quot;Girl happy now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Willow exhaled, though her shoulders slumped, and she was suddenly
reminded of the bump to the head she'd received as the world threatened to tilt on its
axis. &quot;Happy.&quot; She sank down on the edge of her bed, tipping her head forward
into her hands as she remembered the sense that Oz was being pulled away from her. Well,
to hell with him. If he wanted to be with Veruca, he could just go to hell. </p>

<p>&quot;Not happy,&quot; Buffy's worried voice broke into Willow's dark thoughts and the
hacker looked up to find her friend studying her with an expression of confused distress.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Willow disagreed as she flopped back onto the bed and folded an arm
over her face. &quot;Just tired.&quot; </p>

<p>Buffy frowned, clearly confused by the obvious untruth, and stretched out next to Willow
on the bed, watching her with curious eyes. &quot;Not happy,&quot; she repeated and
reached out to pry Willow's arm away from her face, leaning forward to study her friend's
features with a worried expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Really,&quot; Willow insisted, &quot;I'm fine.&quot; And she started to push up on
her hands. A hand landed solidly in the center of her chest, pressing her back down.</p>

<p>&quot;Not happy,&quot; Buffy repeated for the third time, her tone brooking no argument.
Obviously Cave-Slayer was not one to be easily dissuaded by arguments. She was far more
tuned into emotions than the spoken word and as far as she was concerned Willow was <i>not
happy</i>.</p>

<p>Willow would have folded her arm back over her face, but Buffy stayed her hand with a look
while she leaned closer, staring into Willow's eyes as though she was trying to understand
the thoughts moving through her friend's head. &quot;Tell,&quot; she said at last.
&quot;Tell, Buffy.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow sighed heavily while Cave-Slayer began stroking her stomach very lightly, trying to
soothe her obvious turmoil. &quot;It's just Oz,&quot; the hacker murmured at last.
&quot;He's...I don't know...it's like he's obsessed with this girl...&quot; And then
Willow found it all spilling out, her boyfriend's distance, her own fears, the sense that
she was losing him, and the desperation she couldn't quite explain. Words tumbled, at
times nonsensically, from her lips. And all the while, Cave-Slayer did the one thing
regular Buffy almost never did and simply lay there listening to the jumbled monologue. It
wasn't that normal Buffy wouldn't have cared, or wouldn't have listened. It was just that
she always felt she should be solving problems, and sometimes that meant she didn't take
the time to just hear the words pouring out. Okay, so Cave-Slayer probably didn't
understand most of what was said, but she genuinely seemed to be listening and her
slightly heavier than normal brow was furrowed with concern. It made Willow feel comforted
and safe and she closed her eyes, sinking down into her mattress as she found the words
finally running dry. She was startled a moment later when she felt the mattress shift and
then the warmth of Buffy's head settled on her shoulder, while the hand on her stomach
relaxed and simply draped across her midsection.</p>

<p>Willow sighed softly, surprised to find that it felt nice, or perhaps more correctly,
surprised to find just how nice it felt.</p>

<p>&quot;Girl feel better?&quot; Buffy questioned after several minutes of lying there in
companionable silence.</p>

<p>When Willow didn't answer, the Slayer pushed up on her hands, arching over the slender
figure of her friend. Willow blinked, opening her eyes to find herself almost nose to nose
with Buffy. Even with her features slightly altered by the spell, her skin grimy and her
hair matted, the Slayer was beautiful Willow realized with a soft gasp. As their eyes
locked and held, the hacker didn't know what to make of things, she only knew that her
heart was hammering in her chest, and her breathing was suddenly coming in short pants.
She didn't have long to wait. Buffy's head slanted, though her gaze never wavered. If
anyone had ever asked Willow to describe what it would likely feel like to be kissed by a
neanderthal, of all the terms she would have chosen, sweet and gentle were nowhere on the
list. And yet, that's exactly what it was, gentle, sweet, warm, and somehow eerily
familiar. Willow heard her own gasp and was amazed to find that Buffy's kiss was even more
tender than Oz's. A callused but gentle hand brushed red strands back from her temple as
Buffy's lips continued exploring her own. Then her other hand brushed down Willow's side,
stroking and exploring with hesitant care. The caress sent a bolt of awareness through the
hacker, tempting her to surrender to the sweet sensations. No--she yanked herself back
from the heady desire. As good as it all felt, it was wrong. Buffy wasn't herself. God
only knew what she'd think if she knew what her primitive alter ego was up to. Willow
braced her hands on Cave-Slayer's chest, all too aware of the muscles working just beneath
the skin as she pressed solidly and twisted her lips away from Buffy's. &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's head lifted, a neat line forming between her thickened brows as she studied her
friend's face carefully. &quot;Girl pretty,&quot; she said very softly and leaned down as
if to snatch another kiss.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Willow repeated, twisting away from the coming caress as she increased the
pressure on Buffy's chest, pushing her back.</p>

<p>Cave-Slayer reared back several inches, her brow deeply furrowed now then caught one of
Willow's hands in her own, pressing it aside as she leaned closer, following some instinct
that told her to take what she wanted. </p>

<p>Willow tensed, achingly aroused, knowing she should put a stop to this and also knowing
she was no match for Buffy's raw strength. Before she could decide how to respond, Buffy's
lips found hers again, this time passionate, moving steadily without being rough. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Willow gasped as she again tore her mouth away and pushed with her free
hand. &quot;It's wrong.&quot; Buffy's eyes narrowed and for just a moment, Willow thought
she was going to continue to press, but her expression suddenly became uncertain and she
pushed back.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy bad?&quot; the Slayer said worriedly as her natural impulse to protect Willow
warred with the genetic urge to conquer.</p>

<p>Willow's hand remained braced on her friend's chest, but she shook her head.
&quot;No...you're not...you're good...it's just...just that, right now, you're not...not
you...the normal you, I mean.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy was clearly not following the discussion, which wasn't too surprising, since Willow
was finding it pretty confusing herself. &quot;Buffy like girl,&quot; she said at last and
leaned back down, though this time she made no effort to steal another kiss. &quot;Like
Will-ow,&quot; she said as though she had to sound out her friend's name. &quot;Will-ow
soft...sweet...pretty...&quot;</p>

<p>Willow sighed, not quite believing that she was fast being seduced by <i>Anthropologist's
Dream Date Buffy (TM)</i>. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she squeaked. &quot;But it would
be...not right...wrong even...I mean--&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy kissed her again and for a moment, the hacker completely lost herself in the kiss,
then tore her lips away again, this time groaning loudly. It was hell being the evolved
one. &quot;I...uh...I gotta get a shower,&quot; she mumbled as she hurriedly scrambled out
from under the confused Cave-Slayer. &quot;That's it...a shower...cold shower...&quot;</p>

<p>The devolved Slayer was staring at her with a confused look. &quot;Show-er?&quot; she
repeated doubtfully.</p>

<p>Willow was already scrambling to find her toilet kit, robe, and nightshirt. &quot;Um,
yeah, shower...it's like, to get clean...I smell smokey and it'll get rid of that...&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer's brow knit with concentration. &quot;Then girl not smell bad?&quot; she asked
at last.</p>

<p>&quot;Right,&quot; Willow confirmed shakily. &quot;Not smell bad...&quot; She ran a
trembling hand through her hair, and maybe not feel quite so...hot.... not hot would be
good. A cold shower was a definite must.</p>

<p>&quot;Good,&quot; Buffy decided approvingly. &quot;Buffy come.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's eyes rounded. She'd been planning on leaving her friend parked in front of the
tv, which according to both Xander and Giles had fascinated her primitive brain. She
didn't even want to contemplate taking Cave-Slayer into the shower room.
&quot;No...no...&quot; she said instantly, then reached over to flip on the tv, hoping to
involve Cave-Slayer in the ongoing adventures of the little tiny people that lived in the
magic box. &quot;I thought you might like to watch the people.&quot; Xander and Giles had
told her about Buffy's fascination and she was hoping to use it to keep Buffy distracted.</p>

<p>Buffy peered at the tv for a moment, then back at Willow and shook her head vehemently.
&quot;No...Buffy come.&quot; Then she started for the door.</p>
