<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 11 (Epilogue)-->

<p>Jane held the door open for Mike as they entered the house.  As he placed
them down, she turned to face him.</p>

<p>"Silence, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing?"</p>

<p>He turned to face her and they looked at each other for a moment then made a
bee-line for the stairs.  About half way up however, Jane stopped mid
stride.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" she asked in a hushed tone.</p>

<p>"It sounds almost like..." Mike began.</p>

<p>"Laughter," Jane finished for him.</p>

<p>"That's good right?" he asked turning to face his fianc=E9.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" she responded even though it came out sounding more like a question.
  "Where's it coming from?"</p>

<p>"It sounds like Brooke's room," he replied.</p>

<p>Cautiously they approached the door to Brooke's room.  As they neared it
they confirmed that the sound they had heard previously was indeed laughter.
  Strictly female laughter Mike noted with a touch of relief.</p>

<p>"It must be...Sam?" Jane asked hopefully.  Mike shrugged and reached out
knocking on the door.</p>

<p>The moment the knock sounded all sounds in the room ceased and desisted ,
blanketing the house in silence.  A moment later they heard Brooke yell out,
"Just a minute", which was followed by muffled voices, silence, more muffled
voices, a loud thud and finally, "come in."</p>

<p>Walking in the adults took in the sight of the room before them.  The
comforter of Brooke's bed was lying crumpled on the floor, the chair from
her vanity mirror was knocked over and the room seemed to just be in a
general state of disarray.  As for the occupants of the room, Brooke was
standing by the side of her bed looking at them through her eyelashes with
both of her hands shoved in her pockets and her head down.  Sam was on the
other side of the bed leaning against the closet door, one of her hands
draped across her stomach and the other covering her mouth.</p>

<p>"Is everything alright here?" Mike asked, the disheveled appearance of the
room clashing painfully in his mind with the sounds they had heard earlier.
It looked like the aftermath of war or at least a colonial dispute, yet all
other evidence was pointing to the fact that the girls had been getting
along prior to their arrival.</p>

<p>"Of course," Brooke answered forcing a look of bewilderment on her face,
conveying what she hoped was a look of utter confusion as to how things
could be anything other than okay.  "Welcome back," she continued yanking
her hands out of pockets and crossing the room with her arms open for hugs.</p>

<p>After Brooke had finished with them and retreated to her former position Sam
made her way over and shrugging indifferently opened her arms and hugged
them both too before she retreated as well.</p>

<p>"So," Mike started slightly put off by the girls behavior, especially
Sam's-prior to five seconds before he had been hard pressed to get anything
other than a smile and a nod out of the girl and she just hugged him.  It
didn't compute.  "Did you two manage to get along while we were gone?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."  "Um hmmm," came the simultaneously replies.</p>

<p>"I see," he responded turning to look at Jane to see if she found their
behavior as strange as he did.  "Well that's...good."</p>

<p>"Yeah."  "Um hmmm," came their responses once more.</p>

<p>"Have you two been rooming together or something?" Jane asked as she spotted
a pair of Sam's pants and one of her shirts lying in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>Sam looked up sharply at the question looking at her mother wide eyed while
Brooke turned and looked at Sam sharply.  They had to keep level heads, she
didn't know anything, it was just a simple question.  All they had to do was
play it cool.  Brooke sighed deeply, they were in trouble.</p>

<p>"WewerejustgoingoutonenightandItriedonsomeofBrooke'sandleftminehere," Sam
responded almost unintelligibly, a smile quickly appearing on her face and
then disappearing just as quickly as she returned her gaze to the ground.</p>

<p>"They're spending quality time together," Jane commented smiling.  "Isn't
that nice?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." "Um hmmm," the two girls responded once again causing the adults to
look at them strangely.</p>

<p>"We should go unpack," Mike commented a moment later.  Though it was true he
found the girls behavior perplexing, they were teenagers and he had always
found them somewhat perplexing so he really wasn't too concerned.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jane responded somewhat more reluctant to just accept their bizarre
behavior.  There was one thing in particular that was nagging at her but she
just couldn't seem to place it at the moment.</p>

<p>As they made there way out of the room, it suddenly struck Jane what was so
odd about the situation and she turned around.</p>

<p>"Sam?" she asked.  Her daughter looked up at her, her face not giving away
anything more than mere curiously.  "Why is your shirt on inside out?"</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked though she looked down at herself as the words left her
mouth.  Sure enough her shirt was on the wrong side.  As she looked down in
a mild panic, her face began to flush and she turned to look at Brooke who
was now covering her face with her hand.  They had been in a state of
semi-undress when they had heard the knock at the door and after an initial
moment of panic they had started to scramble around the room trying to find
the articles of clothing they had thrown about.  They thought they had it
covered when Brooke tossed Sam her shirt...but apparently not.</p>

<p>Brooke, who had been trying to control her laughter since almost the moment
their parents walked in finally lost it seeing the look on Sam's face and
broke out laughing.  Jane and Mike turned to each other not knowing what was
so funny about the situation, but finding it mildly amusing because of
Brooke's reaction nonetheless.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Sam muttered in Brooke's direction as she tugged at her shirt.
"It's all your fault."</p>

<p>"My fault?" Brooke asked incredulously in between laughing fits.  "You came
in here, remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes I remember.  Do you remember 'waste not want not Sam'," the brunette
shot back at her.  It was no use however, Brooke had fallen onto the bed
still laughing, and Jane and Mike had quietly exited the room not quite sure
what to make of the situation.</p>

<p>"That was...odd," Mike commented as they made their way to their bedroom.</p>

<p>"To say the least," Jane agreed.  "But, at least they're getting along now."</p>
