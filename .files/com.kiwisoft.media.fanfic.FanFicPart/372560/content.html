<p><b>A/N:</b> You guys would not believe how nervous I am about this. I really hope I did okay. Let me know.

<p><b>Ducky and Satan</b></p>
<p><b>XxX41myeohmye14XxX's Sex Questionnaire</b></p>
<p><b>1. Name?</b> Ra-I mean Libby and Q told us we should come up with code names. What is yours gonna be, S? <i>This is lame.</i> I think I'll use your special name for me. <i>You mean your sexy name?</i> No, my special name. Ducky. :) <i>Brit</i> Ducky. <i>Gah, fine! Ducky, you </i><i><u>swore</u></i><i> not to </i><i><u>ever</u></i><i> tell </i><i><u>anyone</u></i><i> about that.</i> I'm sorry. I can't think of anything else. :( <i>Ugh. Fine. Mine is…Satan (and Q, if you read this, yes, that is just to piss you off).</i> But you don't have one of those pitchfork things.</p>
<p><b>2. Reason for taking this?</b> Libby and Q said it would be fun. <i>Sexy Q (let's take a minute to make fun of </i><i><u>that</u></i><i>, please) said she scored like three times just filling this out. And a bunch of times afterward.</i></p>
<p><b>3. Sexual orientation (if you know)?</b> There's a sex class? San, we should take it! <i>They mean do you prefer girls or guys.</i> Oh. I like Satan. :) <i>…I like you, too, Ducky.</i></p>
<p><b>4. Which sex are the majority of your fantasies about?</b> Missionary. That's what that position is called, right? <i>They mean do you dream about guys or girls more.</i> Oh. <i>And yes, that is what that position is called.</i> I dream about Satan a lot. How about you, San? <i>Mostly girls.</i> :)</p>
<p><b>Have you ever:</b></p>
<p><b>5. </b>…<b>kissed someone?</b> Lots of people! <i>This is the lamest questionnaire ever. I'm going to beat 'Libby' over the head with it when we're done.</i></p>
<p><b>6. Had sex?</b> Lots of times. <i>This questionnaire deserves to be set on fire.</i></p>
<p><b>7. Dry humped?</b> My dog does that to my uncle. <i>…Yeah, we've done it.</i></p>
<p><b>8. Been walked in on?</b> Q said she was going to burn out her eyes. I don't think she should. She has pretty eyes. <i>My mom wouldn't talk to me for two weeks.</i> I'm sorry. :( <i>That was with Puck—not your fault. Bastard remembers a condom but doesn't lock the door? Moron.</i></p>
<p><b>9. Had someone watch?</b> I don't like being watched. I get all self-conscience. <i>Conscious. Me, too.</i></p>
<p><b>10. Watched others have sex?</b> I didn't mean to. Someone called my mom and she didn't lock the door. <i>I hate seeing parents making the beast. Blech.</i></p>
<p><b>11. Made out at a dance?</b> Lots of times. I think I'm getting a good score, San. <i>Good for you.</i></p>
<p><b>12. Had sex at a dance?</b> Almost. <i>What?</i> Karofsky passed out during. Does it still count? <i>…No, I guess not.</i> Have you? <i>Yeah.</i></p>
<p><b>13. Gone to a hotel just to have sex?</b> <i>After that whole thing with Mom, I don't really have any other choice.</i> I love the Days Inn. We should go there tonight. <i>Maybe this questionnaire isn't half-bad….</i></p>
<p><b>14. Had sex on your parents's bed?</b> That was fun, wasn't it? <i>Yeah. Is your mom taking another long vacation soon?</i> She said soon. Oh, we could eat popcorn in bed again! And watch 'Happy Feet'! <i>Right. Or we could do other stuff.</i></p>
<p><b>15. Had sex with your parents home, without them knowing?</b> I always tell Mom. <i>You do?</i> So she won't walk in. She buys me condoms. <i>Oh…well…until Puck was an idiot, I did.</i></p>
<p><b>16. Had sex the first time you met someone?</b> There was this guy at this club. He was really nice. He bought me breakfast. <i>B-Ducky, what have I told you about that? Fucking strangers is a </i><i><u>bad</u></i><i> idea. STDs, and all that.</i> I didn't have sex with him. I was just telling you about my morning. <i>…Anyway.</i></p>
<p><b>17. Had sex at a movie?</b> I find them distracting. <i>They're talking about in a theater.</i> Oh. That's even worse. But I didn't mind doing it to you. <i>I know for a fact Q had to have gotten some by now. What am I doing wrong here?</i> You could just ask me. :) <i>Oh.</i></p>
<p><b>18. Had sex in a public place?</b> I think we just did. <i>The library is a pretty public place. Even if no one's here.</i> That was fun. We should do it again, only this time you can <i>Okay, try to remember that Libby and Q are probably going to read this since we read theirs….</i> But I thought you said we weren't going to tell them we did. <i>Oh, right. Damn it.</i></p>
<p><b>19. Had sex outdoors?</b> I had to quit. Bark is scratchy. <i>Running away from the neighbor's insane dog wasn't fun, either.</i></p>
<p><b>20. Had sex while driving?</b> I thought I was always driving when I do guys. <i>They mean in a car.</i> Oh. Backseats are small. <i>You've never had sex in a car while it was driving?</i> That sounds confusing. <i>Gah, so much to teach you.</i></p>
<p><b>21. Had sex with chocolate sauce, honey, etc.?</b> Nope. <i>Me, either.</i> Libby told me it's fun. <i>I have doubts about Tranny's definition of 'fun.'</i> She says there's shower sex afterward. <i>…I may have to rethink my opinion of Libby.</i></p>
<p><b>22. Had sex sitting?</b> Is that like when we do this?</p>
<p><i>Yep. I like this questionnaire.</i> More than you like me? :( <i>Of course not.</i> :)</p>
<p><b>23. Had sex standing?</b> Yep! S, do you think I'm going to win? <i>Totally.</i> :D</p>
<p><b>24. Had sex with a virgin?</b> I don't think so. <i>Karofsky was a virgin.</i> Really? Yay me! :D How about you, S? <i>Frankenteen—worst sex ever.</i> Aww, can I make it up to you? <i>I'm not gonna say no to that.</i></p>
<p><b>25. Had sex with bondage?</b> Satan and I bond all the time, even when we're not doing it. <i>They mean like handcuffs and stuff, B-Ducky.</i> Oh. Yeah, I have. But only with S. I'm afraid other people will leave me tied up. <i>I would never do that.</i> I know. :D</p>
<p><b>26. Had sex with more than one person at a time?</b> Yep! Puck wanted Libby to do it with us, but she kept saying no. <i>Thank God for her prudishness. </i>She likes prunes? Maybe that's what we should get her for her birthday. <i>…</i></p>
<p><b>27. Had sex with both a man and a woman (at different times)?</b> I'm confused. <i>Yeah, Q said to skip this one. Something about unclear meaning making people cry or…I don't know.</i> Oh.</p>
<p><b>28. Had sex with both a man and a woman (at the same time)?</b> Yep! But I think I prefer it when Puck isn't there. <i>Me, too. He's a moron.</i></p>
<p><b>29. Had sex with 3 or more in the same night?</b> No. :( S, I lost one. <i>This is a good one to lose.</i> Really? Did you lose it? <i>Yes. Barely.</i></p>
<p><b>30. Teased someone successfully for over an hour?</b> Almost. :( I made it to 56 minutes. <i>So that's what the stopwatch was about….</i></p>
<p><b>31. Done a striptease?</b> Satan usually stops me before I finish. But she didn't when we did it on that webcam she bought me for Christmas. <i>I hate you.</i> :'( <i>I didn't mean—gah, stop pouting at me! You know I didn't mean it that way. But I am taking the webcam back.</i></p>
<p><b>32. Seen a striptease at a public establishment?</b> Does the choir room count? <i>No, they mean like have you paid to see one at a strip club.</i> Oh. Have you? <i>Let's just say I'll never waste my allowance like that again.</i></p>
<p><b>33. Bought sexual aids?</b> S won't let me. She always pays for them. <i>Great. I'll never live </i><i><u>that</u></i><i> down when Q reads this.</i></p>
<p><b>34. Used sexual aids?</b> Satan? <i>Yes, Ducky?</i> Why would you buy sexual aids but not use them? <i>That…is a really, really good question. </i>It was? <i>Yes.</i> :D</p>
<p><b>35. Seduced someone?</b> Yeppers! But I think I lost my powers. <i>Why's that?</i> Cause Kurt turned me down even though he was dressing in farmer clothes. <i>Yeah…we need to talk about that….</i></p>
<p><b>36. MADE your fantasy come true?</b> Well…usually I just tell Satan. Is that making it come true? <i>I guess.</i> Yay, I don't lose this one! :)</p>
<p><b>37. Caused someone who was straight or gay to become bisexual?</b> No, but S did me. :D <i>Really?</i> Yep!</p>
<p><b>Favorite:</b></p>
<p><b>38. Position?</b> I like the missionary. How about you, S? <i>I'll show you.</i></p>
<p><b>39. Dirty phrase?</b> That was fun. :) <i>Thank you.</i> I like it when you sing to me. <i>I thought you liked dirty talk. </i>I do, but I like the singing more. <i>God, I'm dating Man Hands.</i> We're dating? <i>…No.</i></p>
<p><b>40. Fantasy?</b> I like the one where I'm a princess and you're my knight. How about you, S? <i>We've never done the princess and the knight.</i> I thought they were talking about fantasies in my head. :/ <i>You never told me about that one.</i> Well, now you know! :) <i>I wonder where we could get a sword….</i></p>
<p><b>Last Few:</b></p>
<p><b>41. Did you like this questionnaire?</b> It was fun. :D I won a lot. <i>I still think it deserves to be set on fire and then fed to a shark, but since I scored (and more than Q—in your face), I'll let it go.</i></p>
<p><b>42. Will you pass this on?</b> Are we, S? <i>Probably not.</i> We could give it to Artie and Tina. :) <i>Yeah. It might be fun watching their skin turn purple and their eyes bulge out like Sesame Street muppets….</i> Satan? <i>Yes, Ducky?</i> Luv you. :) <i>…Luv you, too.</i></p>
