<!-- Behind the Scenes \ Part 2 -->

<p>"CUT!" </p>

		<p>The director ripped off his headphones and swore under his breath, walking over to the feuding actresses.</p>

		<p>"Break it up. Now!" He yelled, glaring at them both. </p>

		<p>He focused his gaze on the smirking face of Nicole Julian, the most obnoxious, arrogant actress he ever had the misfortune of working with. If she wasn't such a good lay, he would have run screaming from the set weeks ago.</p>

		<p>"Nicole?"</p>

		<p>"Yes?"</p>

		<p>"Have you read the script?"</p>

		<p>"Of course".</p>

		<p>He stepped closer, his voice rising with every word.</p>

		<p>"That's interesting, because I don't recall reading Stacey trying to punch Alex in the face!"</p>

		<p>"I improvised" Nicole answered, glaring at Sam who was standing several feet away, enjoying the show.</p>

		<p>"Don't! Improvise!" He yelled before stalking away. He definitely needed a drink. Or ten.</p>

		<p> "Lunch break everyone!" </p>

		<p>Nicole walked over to Sam. "Bitch".</p>

		<p>Sam just shook her head, glaring back. "You know, if you just focused your energy on getting the scene right, we wouldn't have to spend so much time together".</p>

		<p>She walked away before Nicole had a chance to respond. Taking a sip from her water bottle, she settled comfortably in her seat, looking up when she saw a figure stop beside her.</p>

		<p>"Ms McPherson?" A man in his early-twenties asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes?"</p>

		<p>"Mr Jackson would like to see you now".</p>

		<p>She stood up, bewildered. "Do you know what it's about?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "He asked me to send for Ms McQueen as well. That's all I know".</p>

		<p>"Thanks" she replied absently, watching him scurry away. She groaned inwardly. </p>

		<p>First Nicole, now Brooke. </p>

		<p>And here she thought today might actually be alright.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Robert Jackson rushed in, taking a seat.</p>

		<p>"Sorry I'm late everybody" he apologized with a smile.</p>

		<p>"You're always late Rob" Sarah pointed out. </p>

		<p>"You're supposed to kiss the boss' ass, not point out their faults" He replied with a smile, turning serious once the laughs tapered off. "Now, I've sent for Sam and Brooke, so they should be here shortly. Let's get started, yes?"</p>

		<p>Helen spoke up. "Well, we checked out the Internet and there are quite a number of sites dedicated to the possibility of an Alex/Jeri romance. I was surprised at how many there actually were".</p>

		<p>Sarah nodded. "We even came across a mailing list, PopularSlash or something. It had over 600 members."</p>

		<p>Rob raised his eyebrows in surprise. "Six hundred? Wow".</p>

		<p>Sarah continued. "Yeah. What surprised me even more were the reasons why many fans believe that subtext exists between them."</p>

		<p>"Exists?" Jack piped up. "What do you mean exist? We never intentionally put any in."</p>

		<p>"Exactly" Helen replied with a smile. "This might not be as hard we imagined".</p>

		<p>"What subtext did they pick up?" Rob asked, curiously.</p>

		<p>"A lot of it was based on body language. Standing too closely together, staring at each other a beat longer than necessary, invading each other's personal space" Helen replied, reading from her list. "They also wonder why Alex and Jeri would concern themselves over what the other thought of them, if they supposedly hate each other".</p>

		<p>"Unless they care for each deep down" Rob replied with a smile. "Which they do".</p>

		<p>Helen nodded, pointing her pencil at him. "Score one for the boss man".</p>

		<p>"Then there is the great chemistry between the actresses themselves" Sarah continued. "I must admit, the fans made a pretty good case. Going over some of the episodes last night, I could see where they were coming from".</p>

		<p>Rob clapped his hands and grinned. "Fantastic. We can make this work."</p>

		<p>They all turned their heads as someone hesitantly knocked on the door.</p>

		<p>"Come in". Rob called out, standing up. He smiled as Sam walked in.</p>

		<p>"Hi everyone" she greeted shyly, planting a kiss on Rob's cheek.</p>

		<p>"How's my girl?" Rob asked, pulling out a chair for her to sit in.</p>

		<p>"Confused. Why am I here?" Sam wanted to know, grabbing a few potato chips from a bowl.</p>

		<p>"We'll answer that question as soon as Brooke arrives" Jack answered, glancing at the clock. "It shouldn't be too much longer".</p>

		<p>"Is it bad?" Sam asked, reaching for more chips. She stopped and watched in fascination as they all mumbled some answer, refusing to look her in the eye. She leant back in her chair and folded her arms.</p>

		<p>"Okay, you guys are officially freaking me out".</p>

		<p>"It's not bad Sam, just...a new change of direction for your character, that's all" Helen replied with what she hoped was a reassuring smile. It didn't work.</p>

		<p>"You're killing me off aren't you?" Sam asked horrified.</p>

		<p>"Of course not" Rob said quickly. "Why the hell would we do that to our most popular character?" </p>

		<p>He stood up to answer the door as another knock rang out. </p>

		<p>"Brooke, nice of you to join us", he welcomed with a smile, accepting a hug from the blonde.</p>

		<p>"It got me out of a boring interview Rob, I owe you one", Brooke replied happily, waving to the others as she sat a couple of seats away from Sam. </p>

		<p>"Sam" she greeted cordially, the smile disappearing from her face.</p>

		<p>"Brooke" Sam responded, looking away.</p>

		<p>Rob exchanged worried glances with his three colleagues, suddenly wishing he was in a galaxy far, far away, safe from the explosion he knew would greet the news.</p>

		<p>"So Rob? Want to fill us in?" Brooke asked, interrupting his thoughts.</p>

		<p>"Right. Of course" he replied, clearing his throat. "Well, we had a visit from one of the executives from the station yesterday, and they want to see some changes".</p>

		<p>Brooke leant forward, concerned. "Changes? What kind of changes?" She looked around the room. "And why are Sam and I the only ones here?"</p>

		<p>"The changes they want relate directly to your characters" Helen answered. She faltered a little, trying to find the best words to explain the situation. "Alex and Jeri will both be acquiring a new love interest".</p>

		<p>"Is that all?" Brooke replied with a laugh. "And this required a meeting?" </p>

		<p>Sam shook her head. "No, there's got to be a catch here somewhere. What is it?" </p>

		<p>"You're right Sam, there is a catch". He leaned forward, gazing at both girls seriously. </p>

		<p>"Alex and Jeri will be falling in love".</p>

		<p>He paused.</p>

		<p>"With each other".</p>
