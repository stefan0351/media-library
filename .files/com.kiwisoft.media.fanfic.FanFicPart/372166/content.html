<P>a/n: this is a pretty short chapter…but not the shortest, but a lot happened in it? Or a little…hmm…anyways, I love to hear what y'all think about how this story is going.</P><P>Chapter Nine: I WANNA KNOW YOU</P><P>I awoke in the morning to find Miley not beside me where she fell asleep as we watched some lame t.v. show on Disney channel about some undercover popstar. I looked around for her, "Miley?" I called out…only seeing Cat laying at the foot of the bed, how she got up there I'll never know…seeing as she could barely make it up the stairs, and when she goes down the steps she makes a loud thudding noise the whole way, as her body hit the step below her. "Where's Miley at Cat?" She just looked at me with lazy eyes, and tucked her head back down to sleep. "You're no help." I slid off the bed, going towards the steps, I stopped when I heard Miley and her parents talking…or arguing almost.</P><P>"Miley! Really, why is that girl over here?" Her dad asked her, "You know what people are going to say if they find out…you don't want the same thing happening to her as that girl Mikayla last summer."</P><P>"Daddy, really…this is nothing like Mikayla last summer, I promise!" I heard her whine, sounding desperate.</P><P>"I already warned her yesterday Robby," Her mom threw in.</P><P>"She really did Daddy," It sounded like Miley was trying to use a puppy dog face to get away from the situation.</P><P>'What happened with this Mikayla girl last summer…? Is this just a game for Miley? 'Cause I was actually starting to like her…especially after I kissed her…something just felt like it clicked with us. Now I feel like I hardly know her…which I hardly do.' I thought to myself, wondering if I should be upset or not.</P><P>"You should be careful Miles; I hate what the kids at school say about you now." I heard another male voice not recognizing it I figured it must be her brother Jackson.</P><P>"Guys! C'mon! I haven't even done anything, I mean…really! Mikayla was completely different."</P><P>"I hope so darlin' cause I don't think there's much else we can say to people around here, you know how they feel about these kinds of things. They don't understand." Her dad said.</P><P>"It's not their little girl, they don't care…they just don't like it, Mikayla was lucky enough to live in Florida, where they're more accepting of things like that…and I'm sure news didn't reach the people in Florida about what happened here."</P><P>"Really, it's different this time I promise." She whimpered softly, I almost didn't hear her. "I'm not gonna do that again…it's so different this time."</P><P>"You really like her don't you Miley?" Jackson asked.</P><P>Miley hesitated, "I, uh, I'm…I'm pretty sure, I do. Mikayla was just a summer thing last year…I don't think I want Lilly just to be a summer thing."</P><P>"Oh Miley, baby, you sure you wouldn't rather just like Travis? It'd be so much easier." Her mom said.</P><P>I laughed, almost, thinking that's what I thought when I first met her.</P><P>"Yes mama I'm sure, now…uh, could this conversation be over? You don't know how awkward this is gettin'…sittin' here having a family discussion about the girl I like."</P><P>Her dad chuckled awkwardly, "It really is…"</P><P>Jackson said, "Yup, well, I'm gonna go eat something and then go leave the rest of it in my room."</P><P>"Speaking of your room Jackson, you need to clean it." Her mom told him, and it sounded like they all left the room and went about there daily business.</P><P>"Gosh, how awkward." I heard Miley mutter as she started clomping her way towards the steps.</P><P>I ran back to her room, and pulled the covers over my head.</P><P>Miley soon flopped down on the bed beside me, "What a way to start my morning off."</P><P>"What is?" I asked sheepishly.</P><P>"Oh, you're awake Lilly?"</P><P>I hesitated, "Yup."</P><P>"You didn't happen to go downstairs did you…or lurk by the steps?" She asked worriedly.</P><P>"Uhh," I'm such a terrible liar.</P><P>"You did didn't you?"</P><P>"Maybe," I squeaked; please don't be mad at me….or should I be the one who's mad at her?</P><P>"God, I'm sorry Lilly…I'm sorry you found out about Mikayla like that…she was nothing though, honestly."</P><P>"What does that make me?" I asked curiously.</P><P>"Um…a lot more to me than Mikayla ever was."</P><P>"What happened with her anyways?"</P><P>Miley laid there quietly beside me, no doubt thinking over what happened with this girl last summer, and I lay beside her just wondering curiously what it was that was flying through her mind. "Could we not talk about it? Everything was going so well…"</P><P>"I…I guess," I looked over at her to see a pained look on her face.</P><P>"So…last night, didn't you, uh, promise me something once the morning came?" She asked, looking slightly more like her devious usual self.</P><P>"Oh I'm not sure; you'll have to refresh my memory." I said to her, with a smirk on my face…knowing exactly what she wanted, but me, not sure if I should give it to her.</P><P>"Well, I think it went a little something like this…." She leaned over to me and then…</P><P>Thud. Thud. Thud….thud. Several more thuds.</P><P>"Got Cat, you just ruin everything don't you?" Miley hollered at Cat who it sounded like was making her way slowly down the stairs.</P><P>One last thud.</P><P>And I burst out laughing. Miley looked at me and grinned. 'God I could live for that smile.' I thought to myself, and smiled back at her.</P>
