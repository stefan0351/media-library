<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Three -->

<p>Immediately she reminded Sam of Sleeping Beauty, if you ignored the bandage on her head and the steady beeping of the cardiac monitor nearby. But other than a few miscellaneous cuts and bruises plus the unnaturally pale pall to her features, Brooke simply looked like she was in a deep peaceful slumber. Only the eerie stillness of her body and the desperate looks on the faces of their parents told Sam otherwise. Jane and Mike looked terrible. Hours of stress, worry, and crying had taken their toll and left them pale, tired, and red-eyed. They sat on either side of Brooke's bed like stone sentries awaiting the girl's recovery. </p>
<p>"How is she?" Sam asked in a whisper unable to get her voice to come out any louder for fear of disturbing the room. She knew it was foolish but she couldn't help it. Mike lifted his head up and gave her a sad look but said nothing. </p>
<p>"No change, Sam," Jane sighed. She looked up at her daughter and opened her arms for the hug that they both needed. She gripped Sam so tightly that Sam was momentarily worried about internal damage. </p>
<p>"God, Sam, did you fly home?" Jane asked a moment later. Sam gave her a lopsided grin. </p>
<p>"Something like that," she responded before turning her attention back to the still form in the bed. "God," she gasped involuntarily. </p>
<p>"She's going to be fine," Mike said with determination. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"I know," she said needing to believe that it was true. She looked at both her parents who were obviously exhausted. </p>
<p>"Look, Mom, Mike, why don't you go home or grab a bite to eat and I'll stay here with her," she suggested gently. She really wanted them to get some rest, they looked awful. Mike's head snapped up and he began to protest. </p>
<p>"I'm not leaving her," he declared. </p>
<p>"Mike, honey," Jane broke in softly. She could see the logic in Sam's suggestion. "You'll be no good to her if you get sick yourself. Let's go home and rest, check on Mac. Then we'll come back. Sam will take good care of Brooke until then and she'll call if there's any change." Sam nodded at her mother's words. </p>
<p>"I promise Mike. She so much as twitches and I'll call," she vowed. Mike ran a tired hand through his hair and sighed. </p>
<p>"I am tired," he admitted. "But I'm so worried." Sam walked over and gave him a hug. </p>
<p>"I'll take care of her, Mike. I promise. Go rest and see to Mac. She needs you too," she said. Mike gave her a small smile. </p>
<p>"Thank you, Sam," he said. She returned the smile as she helped him up and he headed to the door with Jane. </p>
<p>"I'll call, I promise," she repeated as the door shut behind them. Now it was just her and Brooke's silent form. She sat down with a heavy sigh and grasped Brooke's warm hand, unconsciously stroking the back of it with her thumb. </p>
<p>"You know if you wanted my full and undivided attention, there were easier ways to get it than wrapping your car around a tree. Granted I haven't been the easiest person to talk to lately but this is a bit extreme. Even for you," Sam joked just to fill the empty space and try to take some of the weight off of the guilt she felt. </p>
<p>"Guess I really screwed things up between us, huh?" she asked. Not surprisingly Brooke didn't respond. Sam stared at Brooke and the sense of panic that she'd been fighting since hanging up the phone slammed into her like an unyielding tidal wave. Fear that Brooke may never wake up, never recover and therefore give Sam the chance to apologize for her behavior and patch things up overwhelmed her. It rose up and cut off her air and brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>"Please wake up, Brooke," she begged as her tears splashed unnoticed onto the bedspread. "If only so that I can apologize. It shouldn't be like this," she sobbed. </p>
<p>"I shouldn't have left. I shouldn't have pushed you away. I just?I just?I'm sorry. I'm so very very sorry," she weeped. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>A week passed with little change in Brooke's condition or in Sam's vigil beside her. She was as much a fixture in Brooke's room as the bed, the curtains, or the heart monitor that diligently kept track of Brooke's condition. Brooke was getting stronger, upgraded to serious condition and moved to a regular room where she could have visitors. The gangs visited constantly but the only person who was there nearly as much as Sam was Harrison. </p>
<p>The little girl who Brooke had almost hit had come by to visit once with her family. Her name was Emma Washington and she was very sad to see that Brooke was 'sick'. Sam had been sitting with Brooke when the Washington's had come to visit and they'd expressed heir sympathies and heartfelt thanks that Brooke had done what she did to save Emma. And Emma had learned a very valuable lesson about running into the road. Emma had drawn a picture for Brooke, of Brooke standing in a field of flowers smiling. It was obviously a drawing done by a four year old but Sam hung it above Brooke's bed near her head so that she'd see it as soon as she woke up. She also promised Emma that Brooke would come by and play ball or dolly's as soon as she was feeling better. </p>
<p>Harrison visited everyday and Sam was respectful of his time with Brooke. She either sat in the corner with a book and her earphones on or just ignored him altogether. But she was reluctant to leave Brooke's side even for Harrison. She and Harrison barely spoke and when they did it was hardly civil. Despite his every intention not to hurt her, by chosing Brooke he had wounded Sam deeply and from that moment on their friendship had quickly soured. On top of that was Sam's behavior and subsequent treatment of Brooke. Harrison had had a front row seat for the show and its effects on the sensitive blonde. He was not happy that Sam would hurt her that way. So in a way Harrison blamed Sam for the whole thing and Sam knew it. </p>
<p>"You have no right to be here," Harrison hissed lowly. Sam looked up from the article she was proofing on her laptop and fixed Harrison with a critical eye.</p>
<p>"I have the same right to be here as everyone else does," she responded smoothly. Harrison scowled at her. </p>
<p>"After all the pain you caused her?" he asked his voice raising slightly. Sam arched an eyebrow slightly and then hit `save' on the computer knowing she wasn't going to get any more work done. </p>
<p>"I made a mistake, Harrison. I'm aware," she informed him flatly. </p>
<p>"A mistake, Sam? A mistake is wearing white after Labor Day. A mistake is letting Mary Cherry give you fashion advice. A mistake is trying to run your best friend down with your car. What you've been doing was a deliberate attempt to hurt Brooke. And you succeeded by the way. You pushed her away and shut her out. It hurt her a lot. You honestly can't expect to waltz back in here and make everything all right, do you?" he ranted. Sam tried desperately to clamp down on the ire she felt building within her. She didn't want to stoop to Harrison's level especially in Brooke's hospital room. </p>
<p>"I deserve the chance," she said evenly. "That's all I want. And whether or not she gives me one isn't up to you, Harrison. It's up to Brooke. So back off before I ram your teeth so far down your throat you have to chew with your feet." Her voice never changed from a calm warning during her entire speech although her hurt and anger were almost enough to make her see red. Worst part was in her opinion Harrison was right and she was expecting more than she deserved. But all she wanted was one chance. </p>
<p>"Whatever," Harrison grumbled standing up to leave. "I'll come back later," he said more to Brooke than Sam. Sam watched him go and then retook her spot next to Brooke. </p>
<p>"And all McQueen's horses and all McQueen's men couldn't put all this mess back together again ," she muttered bitterly. </p>
