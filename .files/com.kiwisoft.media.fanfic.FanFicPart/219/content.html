<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 1 -->

<p>B'Elanna felt numb, what was just a deuterium salvage operation had become something more, much more. Voyager had received a distress call, but as they got there the ship had been destroyed, or as she now knew, had self-destructed. What had caught her attention was that the debris field was FULL of deuterium. The Captain was ready to lay course back to the Alpha Quadrant when she managed to convince her to restock their deuterium supplies. Then in the debris field they found several things that did not conform to the rest of the fields make up. One of the things being what had appeared to be some sort of probe. She noticed the Federation style right away and was afraid that a rescue ship had been sent, and destroyed.</P>
<p>The notification she sent to the bridge had set of a flurry of activity, anyone who wore engineering yellow, and several who weren't were in the engine room going over the odd debris they salvaged. She had used her authority as chief of engineering to get a station to herself and she now looked over it to see the biosuit that had stopped being out of place in engineering. She swallowed hard and keyed the console to replay the piece of data she had recovered from the probe. The small screen came to life with the image of Seven of Nine, but not as B'Elanna knew her. The normally perfect hair bun was wild, and her flawless face seemed, melted. Even the ocular implant was running down her face as she spoke into the viewscreen.</P>
<p>"Personal Log Seven of Nine. We will not reach the demon planet. Acting Captain Harry Kim is still making all efforts to return us there, but all calculations arrive at the same result, Voyager, our Voyager will loose cohesion before that happens. Yet I find that I do not care. My own destruction seems irrelevant in what I have come to acknowledge as regret." The former drone seemed to take a deep breath to steady herself against forces far greater then the ones disintegrating her flesh. "Strangely my greatest regret is not the loss of Lieutenant Torres, for while painful death is a certainty for everyone. My regret is that she died with out knowing my feelings for her." B'Elanna paused the log entry and tried to steady herself as a wave of dizziness crashed over her. </P>
<p>With out thinking her eyes looked up over the console for the flawless features, and found them. Seven was watching her. It was subtle, and vanished as soon as B'Elanna looked up fully, but it was there. The rush of sensation that it caused threatened to send her crash to the deck beneath her. How long had Seven been watching her? As she resumed play on the recording she realized it was longer then she thought. "I did not tell her before her wedding to Lieutenant Paris, yet I did not tell her anything in the year and a half previous." Torres paused the recording again, her and Tom married. Sure they had talked about it. They also talked about how he would need to get his act together before it would ever happen. She allowed his hobbies, but she was not about to settle into a life of "See you later honey." Looking back at the recording she couldn't take her eyes off the woman's face. Even in its melted, misshapen state she saw more emotion then she had ever seen Seven show.</P>
<p>Her hand seemed to have a mind of its own as she reached out and touched the screen. The hand then moved over and restarted the log. "Only now, in the face of oblivion am I able to say it. I love. loved you B'Elanna Torres." Her eyes closed as she watched Seven end the recording and the screen go blank. They stayed closed as she tried to keep herself from crying. What a bitch she had been. Seven didn't endure her abuse because she enjoyed tormenting her; she endured it because she wanted to be close to her. "So was it a Federation ship?" Her eyes opened as she recognized the voice of Harry Kim and turned to face him. "Not quite, get the captain to call a staff meeting." Harry looked confused as he nodded and turned away. She gathered together all the salvaged data, but not before she tucked away the recording into a safe little out of the way place. </P>

<P>"So how did this other Voyager catch up to us? A lot has happened since the demon planet." B'Elanna kept her eyes on her superior officer as she answered Janeway's question. "They managed to create an enhanced warp drive. It was what caused their molecular structures to break down." The Doctor was the next to speak. "Then why did they use it?" "It would have gotten them to Earth in just over two years, and it was not harmful to humanoids. They just didn't realize that they were not humanoid." Then entire crew's eyes went wide as Janeway asked the question they all had. "Could we build our own?" B'Elanna took a deep breath as she started running schematics in her head. "Maybe, but the records were damaged when they lost cohesion." Janeway nodded curtly. "Have Seven work with you on recovering them." The Captain then paused a moment before resuming. "They may have been our duplicates, but from everything we have recovered they upheld the same ideals. That alone makes them worthy of remembering." The crew seemed sobered as the Captain spoke again. "Dismissed." The crew quietly stood up and walked for the door, but B'Elanna found herself intercepted face to chest with Seven of Nine. "Lieutenant Torres, if you will transfer the data to astrometrics we can begin reconstructing it there." The normal reply B'Elanna would have had to such a tone was noticeably absent as she replied. "Sure Seven, see you there." She seemed confused, but nodded as her normal, efficient, stride carried her from the room, and to B'Elanna's alarm she couldn't help but watch her go.</P>
