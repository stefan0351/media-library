<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 2: Figuring Out-->

<p>Willow was trying to concentrate on taking her last final of her junior year. Really she was. She just couldn’t seem to stay focused. And usually concentrating on academics let her forget her confusion. Buffy was in the front row taking the final too. That was the problem.</P>
<p>Somehow Giles had gotten her expulsion revoked. Willow didn’t know how he did it, but all she knew was that Principal Snyder had taken a sick day today. </P>
<p><I>‘Just one more question, and then you’re done. Then you can go.’ </I>Willow told herself. Filling in the final bubble on her scantron sheet, she put her still sharp number-two pencil down, and raised her hand.</P>
<p>"Yes, Willow?" The proctor asked.</P>
<p>"I’m finished. Can I go to the bathroom?"</P>
<p>"Do you need assistance with your chair?"</P>
<p>Willow saw Buffy start to get up.</P>
<p>"No I got it."</P>
<p>She saw the hurt in Buffy’s eyes, but pushed herself to the bathroom. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>She looked at herself in the mirror. She thought she looked better. Well, less corpse-like anyway. She needed to think.</P>
<p>She wasn’t distracted by Buffy because she had a burning desire to kiss her or anything like that, (although since their mutual admission it had crossed her mind), it was more that she didn’t know how to act or what to do. She admitted that she loved her, and that was the truth, but what next? She was a seventeen-year-old, book/computer geek, innocent Jewish girl. She had always followed everyone else’s expectations, and never did anything that could be considered "out of society’s norm". But this, this was a huge leap out of the norm.</P>
<p>It’s not that she had a problem with people who chose to be ‘that way’, but she had never thought of herself as ‘that way’. It scared her. As much as she hated to think it, she was concerned about what people would say. But even that wasn’t the real issue.</P>
<p>She didn’t want to hurt anybody. And by that, she meant Oz. She had always believed that love was love. So what if they were both females? If love hits you, you can’t just push it away. </P>
<p><I>‘But Oz…’</I></P>
<p>She figured out a while ago that Xander was a crush, and seeing him happy with Cordelia, made her happy. But Oz was a terrific guy. A great all around person, actually. He had helped her to come out of her shell. Made her less shy, less afraid. More open. But Buffy also did that. Buffy was the one who had made her go up to him in the first place.</P>
<p><I>‘She’s done so much for me.’</I></P>
<p>She had gotten Willow to wear that outfit on Halloween, and forced her to realize how beautiful she really was. Had supported her when Xander couldn’t, had been her first real female friend. Buffy gave her that, and Oz repeatedly kept showing her why she was beautiful and worth it.</P>
<p>"I don’t know what to do." She said aloud.</P>
<p>"Don’t worry about it."</P>
<p>In the mirror, she saw Cordelia come up behind her.</P>
<p>"Cordelia!"</P>
<p>"Buffy or Oz, huh? Tough choice."</P>
<p>"How’d you know?"</P>
<p>"Oh please. It’s obvious. Besides, I heard her in the hospital."</P>
<p>"Oh." Willow said quietly and suddenly was worried.</P>
<p>"Relax. I can keep quiet."</P>
<p>"You’re not gonna make any kind of comment at all?"</P>
<p>"What would be the point?"</P>
<p>"True."</P>
<p>"What you need right now is to make a decision."</P>
<p>"Gee thanks for letting me know." Willow said sarcastically.</P>
<p>"Personally, if I had to choose between Buffy and Oz, I’d choose Buffy. Not that I’m…ya know."</P>
<p>"I didn’t think I was either, okay? Why would you pick Buffy?"</P>
<p>"Cause she’s different than you."</P>
<p>"You think?"</P>
<p>"I mean it. You give her things she doesn’t have; she gives you things you don’t have. You’ve changed a lot, Willow. Buffy gives you confidence, you help her keep her sanity. I hate to go Jerry Maguire on you, but you complete one another."</P>
<p>"And Oz?"</P>
<p>"Is like you more than not. He’s a brain, he’s into computers, and he’s quiet. People who have more sames than differences don’t survive in a relationship. It’s boring."</P>
<p>"So that’s why you and Xander are still together huh?"</P>
<p>"Exactly. He’s gives me a sense of humor and helps me keep things light, and I give him fashion sense."</P>
<p>Willow laughed. "You sure about that?"</P>
<p>"Hey I’m working on it, okay?" Cordelia smiled.</P>
<p>Willow had to admit that she was surprised by Cordelia’s advice. Not because she gave her advice, but because it actually made sense. She and Cordelia had grown closer and she was glad she was a serious part of the group now. Willow needed to talk about all this with Buffy, and that’s what she was going to do.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow was walking slowly, on crutches, around Buffy’s bedroom. Buffy was out patrolling, and her mom had told Willow she could come in and wait for her. Everything that Buffy was - was contained in this room. Everything from her life before her duty trapped her.</P>
<p>Stuffed animals were on her bed, ice skates were hanging on the back of her dresser chair, and pictures were situated on her dresser mirror. One of the pictures was of Buffy, her, and Xander at the ice rink. They were standing over an embarrassed Xander, who had fallen on his butt. Willow laughed. Buffy had a lot of talent on the ice. If not for her slaying, she would probably be training for the Olympics right now.</P>
<p>She wasn’t sure when her love for Buffy had surpassed friendship. She didn’t even know that love was what she felt until recently. Everyone knew that Willow wasn’t too sure of her emotions. She thought it started after she had begun getting over her hopeless pursuit of Xander.</P>
<p>Buffy had helped her to grow, and while she was depressed about how Xander had never even glanced at her, she complemented Willow. Made her feel attractive, supported her. At first, she thought that it was just friendly support, but she saw something in Buffy’s eyes.</P>
<p>Nothing verging on lust or anything like that, but more like a genuine affection, even when she was wrapped up in Angel. As quickly as she saw it, it was gone just as quickly. And that’s when she met Oz. Someone who actually liked her.</P>
<p>He was a guitar player. In a band. And if that wasn’t shocking enough, he was actually sensitive. Not like a regular guy at all. And she got swept up in it all. Everything was great, and then Buffy’s life fell apart.</P>
<p>As much as Willow wanted to be happy, she couldn’t. Not just because her life was threatened, but because Buffy was, to put in its simplest form, extremely unhappy. And Buffy needed her for support, but didn’t come to her because Buffy wanted her not to worry. She had always put Willow’s happiness before her own. 	</P>
<p>So when she had a chance to give Buffy back what she thought would make her happy, she took it. She tried to give Angel back his soul. She knew it was dangerous, but how could she not risk her life for Buffy? She had given Willow so much.</P>
<p>If it came down to Buffy and Oz, she would pick Buffy over him without question. And it wasn’t because she was closer to Buffy or liked her anymore than Oz; it was because if Buffy had died, she would never be the same. She had a lot of time to think in the hospital. In the coma and out, and got her priorities in order.</P>
<p>She loved Buffy. After she had ‘visited’ Buffy, and found out she was going to leave after it was all said and done, Willow knew then and there, what emotion she had always felt toward Buffy. It had been hidden, but it was love. </P>
<P>She was still uncertain as to what would happen in the coming months, but she knew they would always have their friendship to fall back on. </P>
<I><P>‘And what good is love without friendship?’ </P>
</I><P>Willow jumped as Buffy came through the window.</P>
<P>"Uh…hi, Buffy. Why’d you come through the window?"</P>
<P>"Mom."</P>
<P>"Oh she left about a half an hour ago. Some emergency shipment came in for the gallery. She’s still not comfortable with the whole Slayer thing?"</P>
<P>"Try extremely uncomfortable. She’s in semi-denial, and we haven’t been talking. Plus she wigged on Giles."</P>
<P>"And that still didn’t convince her?"</P>
<P>"What can I say? She’s stubborn."</P>
<P>"Like mother, like –"</P>
<P>"Watch it."</P>
<P>Willow grinned.</P>
<P>"Hey. How’d you get up here?"</P>
<P>"Crutches."</P>
<P>"Don’t over exert yourself."</P>
<P>"I think I do need to sit."</P>
<P>Buffy helped her to sit down on the bed.</P>
<P>"Thanks. How’d patrolling go?"</P>
<P>"Nada."</P>
<P>"No vampires?"</P>
<P>"Since Spike and Dru split, it’s been pretty quiet."</P>
<P>"Well, that’s a good."</P>
<P>"You think I’d be too optimistic if I said we might have a relaxing summer?"</P>
<P>"Maybe just a little."</P>
<P>There was an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes, before Buffy said what they were both thinking.</P>
<P>"So…I guess we should talk."</P>
<P>"Yeah. Talking is a good thing."</P>
<P>"I gotta admit, I’m not sure what to do. It’s a little scary."</P>
<P>"You mean I’m not the only one who thinks that?"</P>
<P>Buffy laughed. "Course not."</P>
<P>"Good, cause I never thought I was…you know."</P>
<P>"Me neither. Who says we are?"</P>
<P>"But we like, love –"</P>
<P>Buffy smiled. "Each other. But I’ve never thought of any other girls ‘that way’. Not until you."</P>
<P>"Me neither."</P>
<P>That was strange but also very comforting to Willow. It made this step that they were taking, all the more special to her.</P>
<P>"Now what?"</P>
<P>"Angel."</P>
<P>"He…was special. And I know there’ll always be a part of me that will love him. But, I think, I know, he’s okay with…‘us’. Oz."</P>
<P>"He’s hard to describe. First guy I loved.  Well, besides Xander. But Oz and I actually have a relationship. It’s nothing like you and Angel had, but…"</P>
<P>"I know what you mean. Look, if you don’t want to –"</P>
<P>"I do, I do. I just need to think of what to say to him."</P>
<P>Another uncomfortable silence passed, before Willow spoke again.</P>
<P>"Should we?"</P>
<P>"We don’t have to."</P>
<P>"Cause it’s still a little strange and all –"</P>
<P>"Yeah it is."</P>
<P>"But –"</P>
<P>Before Willow could say another word, Buffy’s lips were covering hers. It was a simple kiss. Longer than a normal friendly kiss, but no farther than that. When they pulled away, it was like an electric shock passed through them.</P>
<P>Willow was smiling.</P>
<P>"That was…nice."</P>
<P>"Very nice." Buffy paused. "Will, I want you to know, that no matter what happens, that I never want to lose our friendship."</P>
<P>"Never happen. But I need to say this out loud. I love you." As soon as it was out of her mouth, she felt extremely happy. She could see the same happiness reflected back in Buffy's eyes.</P>
<P>"Good, cause I love you too."</P>
<P>Willow’s stomach growled.</P>
<P>"Somebody’s hungry." </P>
<P>"I haven’t eaten much since I got out of the hospital."</P>
<P>"Ice cream?"</P>
<P>"Rocky road?"</P>
<P>"You got it. Be right back."</P>
<P>"Hey Buffy?"</P>
<P>"Yeah?"</P>
<P>Willow had a glint in her eyes.</P>
<P>"Slumber Party!" They both said.</P>
<P>"Cordelia and Xander?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"Oz?"</P>
<P>"He’s not much into group sleepovers."</P>
<P>"Try anyway?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"Okay." Willow said picking up Buffy’s phone.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Several hours later, Buffy and Willow were lying on Buffy’s bed, Cordelia and Xander were sitting on the floor, and Oz was sitting in the chair.</P>
<P>"We’ve already watched two movies, and gone through three bags of popcorn. Shouldn’t you two men be heading downstairs to go to sleep?" Buffy said.</P>
<P>"I for one plan on camping out right here." Xander said.</P>
<P>Buffy shook her head.</P>
<P>"I thought we were buds!"</P>
<P>"Oh we are. But there’s always limits to ‘bud’ privileges."</P>
<P>"We should tell them before they go to sleep, don’t you think?" Willow asked Buffy.</P>
<P>"Did you wanna tell them now?"</P>
<P>"Oh if its about you two being a couple thing, don’t worry about it." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>"Cordelia!" They both shrieked.</P>
<P>"Yeah, Cordy filled us in already. Why do you think I wanna sleep in here?" Xander waggled his eyebrows.</P>
<P>He got hit with every stuffed animal and pillow that was on the bed.</P>
<P>"You seem okay with this, Xand."</P>
<P>"Well, Will’s so much better for you then Angel. Besides, it helps broaden my fantasy library."</P>
<P>"Xander!" Willow said in shock. Cordelia hit him that time.</P>
<P>"I guess that’s my cue to go downstairs?"</P>
<P>"You learn fast." Buffy said.</P>
<P>Xander slowly walked out of the room.</P>
<P>"Guess I better go too." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Wait, Oz. Can we talk somewhere?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>Oz nodded.</P>
<P>"You can use mom’s room." Buffy said.</P>
<P>As Willow and Oz left the room, Buffy glared at Cordelia.</P>
<P>"What?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow and Oz sat on Joyce’s bed.</P>
<P>"So…" They said at the same time.</P>
<P>"Are you okay?" Willow asked gently.</P>
<P>"Still in shock mode right now."</P>
<P>"You’re not the only one, believe me. You think I saw this coming?"</P>
<P>"No, because if you did, you would’ve told me."</P>
<P>"You know I would have."</P>
<P>"You can take care of each other. You’re good for one another."</P>
<P>"You’re my first real love, I hope you know that."</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"And it’s not like Buffy –"</P>
<P>"I know. I don’t blame either one of you."</P>
<P>"If you’re angry with me, I wish you’d tell me."</P>
<P>"I’m not. I never could be. You went to Buffy. Not some no-name person. She’s special to you."</P>
<P>"She is. But you’ll always be special to me."</P>
<P>"Same here, Will. I hope it works out for you. And…I’m always here if you need anything."</P>
<P>"That offer goes both ways."</P>
<P>Oz smiled.</P>
<P>"I better go stake out the couch before Xander does."</P>
<P>Willow smiled in return, and he kissed her on the cheek.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>When Willow walked back into Buffy’s room, Buffy was in bed, and Cordelia was lying on blankets on the floor. Willow lied down beside Buffy.</P>
<P>"You can keep quiet, huh?" Willow asked Cordelia sarcastically.</P>
<P>"They’re our friends. You were gonna tell them anyway."</P>
<P>"That’s her point, Cordy. We were gonna tell them."</P>
<P>"Well excuse me. Next time you wanna come out of the closet, I’ll keep my mouth shut."</P>
<P>"Cordelia we’re not –" They both started.</P>
<P>"Geez…I was kidding. Take a Prozac or something."</P>
<P>Buffy turned off the light, and tentatively started to put her arm around Willow. She didn’t pull away, so Buffy shifted closer.</P>
<P>They smiled at each other.</P>
<P>"Good night." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Good night." Willow said, followed by Cordelia.</P>
<P>Their last thoughts as they drifted off to sleep were, <I>‘This is definitely strange, but... it’s a good thing.’</I>/P>
<P>They lived on a Hellmouth. What wasn’t strange?</P>
