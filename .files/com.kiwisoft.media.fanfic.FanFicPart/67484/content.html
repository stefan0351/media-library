<!-- The Truth about Tippy Typewriter \ Part One -->

<p>"Brooke?" Sam said as she leaned against Brooke's open door frame.</p>
		<p>"Yeah?" The blonde answered, looking up from her calculus homework.</p>
		<p>"I was just wondering if I could borrow your computer for a moment. I
			need to install a program on my laptop, so right now it's in defrag
			mode." Sam replied.</p>
		<p>"And you need my computer to...?" Brooke asked.</p>
		<p>"I have a mass email to send out to my team at the paper. I told them
			I'd have it out by 8:00, it's now, 8:15." She said looking down at her
			watch.</p>
		<p>"I guess that's fine. Just don't fill my comp full of internet porn.
			I've seen your laptop." Brooke said trying to look serious.</p>
		<p>Sam just smirked as she walked over to Brooke's desk. "I'm not the one
			with scantily clad bodies as my desktop wallpaper." She retorted,
			moving Brooke's wireless mouse, removing the blonde's annoying,
			bouncing, "Bring It!" Pep Squad screensaver. She pointed to the screen
			as if reiterating her point.</p>
		<p>"It's a United Colors of Bennetton ad." Brooke huffed, sticking out of
			her tongue.</p>
		<p>"Whatever you say." Sam replied with a huge grin as she turned back to
			the computer. She popped her disk in the A drive and began to type
			furiously.</p>
		<p>The two worked in companionable silence. Brooke was somehow oddly
			comforted by the brunette's presence and the light sound of the keys
			tapping, barely able to be heard over the mixed cd playing in the
			blonde's stereo. At one point, they were both humming along with the
			sweet sounds of the Cranberries "Linger." It wasn't long before Brooke
			was done with her homework, and Sam was thanking her and bidding her
			goodnight.</p>
		<p>She took up the journalist's still warm spot on her desk chair and
			looked at her AIM away message screen. She had several messages from
			Carmen and Mary Cherry. She decided to answer their inane questions as
			quickly as possible. She had a test first period, and she was hoping
			to get to bed early.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Hey Carm, what did you need?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Hang on, one sec Brooke. Sam's asking me about
				my notes from our French class.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: K...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Sam was online? Brooke looked at her buddy list and sure enough the
			brunette's screen name was there at the top of her list. It was weird
			Sam hadn't messaged her. In the short time since Mac had been born and
			she'd almost lost her life to insane ex-best friend, she and Sam had
			become almost inseparable. That tends to happen when that person saves
			your life, Brooke thought. She was so grateful to Sam, and not only
			for pushing her out of the way that fateful night, but the journalist
			had proven to be the best friend she'd ever had. She opened up a
			window to message Sam, when another popped up in the way.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Hey Brookie!</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Hey Mary Cherry...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: R we still on 4 practice 2morrow after school? Joe
				and I have plans.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Of course we still have practice, weren't you at
				the pep rally last week? We looked like a flock of uncoordinated seagulls.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: I know, Brookie, but Joe's takin' me to see the new
				Gwyneth movie.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Well if you and Carmen can manage to get the
				others whipped into shape, I might let you go early.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: But Brooke, you know that's damn near impossible.
				It's bad enuff that none of them are as coordinated or stunnin' as you
				and I are. I can't work miracles, hun...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Just then Carmen's window started blinking. She clicked on it pulling
			up the conversation.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: OK sorry about that. I swear you would think she
				wasn't even in class...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Carm...?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Oh right! I just made this ah-mazing mix for
				next week's game. I was wondering if you might want to hear it tomorrow.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Uh yeah, sure I guess. We can listen to it on the
				way to school. I'll be by at 7 btw. I have a test first period.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: OK cool, I'll be ready.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke brought up the window for Sam's screen name again, ignoring the
			flash from the other two conversations that apparently were still
			taking place.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Hey are you mad at me or something?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>Auto response from LoisLane082884: trying to finish my
				homework...damn my procrastinating ways....</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Damn I missed her, Brooke thought. She closed Sam's window and brought
			Mary Cherry's back up.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Brooke? Brooke? Where'd ya go?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: I'm here...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Well I have to get goin hun. Joe is on the phone.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Oh ok, see you tomorrow</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe: Bye hun...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>MClovesJoe signed off at 9:06:47 PM</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Now to get rid of Carmen...</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: My mom is totally psyched for Homecoming this
				year. Are you gonna run?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: I haven't really given it much thought. I'm
				probably going to just keep a low profile this year. The Bring It
				squad is more than enough for me to handle.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>And that was true, ever since Nicole had transferred from Kennedy this
			year, she'd been named Captain of the squad and Carmen co-captain. So
			far, things had been going great, and the groups had merged
			harmoniously, the last piece falling into place when Harrison had
			started dating Mary Cherry two months ago, much to everyone's
			surprise. Brooke shuttered, wondering what she'd ever seen in him. She
			just chocked it up to a momentary lapse in judgment.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Well I'm definitely gonna run again if I'm
				nominated. OMG! What if I'm not nominated? Brooke what am I gonna to do?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. She didn't know how Sam had put up with this
			constantly talking Carmen off of a ledge routine. They'd been good
			friends for almost two years now, and she was definitely tired of it.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Relax Carm, I'm sure you'll be nominated.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002: Thanx, well anyway I have one more calc problem
				to do, and then I'm heading to bed. See you in the morning.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Night, Carm...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>CheerBear2002 signed off at 9:24:55 PM</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke sighed with relief. She checked her list one more time, annoyed
			to see that little yellow "post-it" next to Sam's screen name. Josh
			and Sugar were both online, but she really wasn't up to talking to
			either one of them. So instead she pulled up her Internet Explorer and
			typed Yahoo Mail into the address bar. She clicked on the inbox tab
			and saw she had several emails. Her eyes were immediately drawn to the
			email saying she had a reply to a comment she'd made in someone else's
			livejournal. She hadn't updated or really read any comments for a
			couple of weeks, but she always got the random response or something
			from one of the arbitrary communities she belonged to.</p>
		<p>Her hazel eyes scanned the email reading the lame response. When she
			came to the original comment she realized she hadn't written it. Not
			only had she not written it, it wasn't even her journal name. It
			wasn't a name she'd recognized at all. She closed the email, looking
			at the name displayed on the inbox. Sam had forgotten to sign out of
			her email. What's more, Sam apparently had a secret journal.</p>
		<p>She immediately opened her journal in another window. She signed in
			and did a quick perusal of all of their friends' user profiles. None
			of them had the journal saved as a friend. She typed in the journal
			name and looked up the user information. Apparently Sam really didn't
			want this journal to be found. Sam had used the pseudonym "Tippy
			Typewriter" and had registered it to a completely different city and
			state. She didn't have really any friends, saved for a few names
			Brooke didn't recognize. Brooke perused the communities "Tippy"
			belonged to. Most of them were musical group communities, a couple of
			fanfiction communities, more importantly, lesbian fanfiction
			communities, and lgbt communities. Sam's gay?! Brooke thought.
			She was shocked. Then again, as she thought about it, she wasn't all
			that surprised. Sam had always marched to her own beat, and didn't
			care about what others thought. It would explain why she got so upset
			that time when they were locked in the Novak, and Lily had confessed
			she'd kissed Carmen. Maybe she'd wished it had been her instead of
			Carmen.</p>
		<p>Brooke thought she should be more upset about this. Sam was gay! Only
			it didn't bother the cheerleader in the least. It wasn't like she
			hadn't ever considered it, but then she'd fallen for Josh again, and
			then Jaime, and then Harrison, so she'd pushed those thoughts from her
			mind. Now she was intrigued. She knew she shouldn't, but she really
			wanted to read this "secret" journal. She got up and crossed her room
			to close her bedroom door. A part of her felt bad for what she was
			about to do, but curiosity seemed to overpower those feelings.</p>
		<p>In all the time she'd known Sam, she'd never been able to figure her
			out, not completely. They'd been living together for almost three
			years, and the brunette was still an enigma. Somehow Sam managed to
			deflect attention away from herself whenever it came to her emotions
			and thoughts, and Brooke hoped that this would give her insight into
			Sam's world, and eventually bring them closer together.</p>
		<p>The blonde checked over her shoulder one last time before clicking the
			link to "Tippy's Journal." The entries had started about three weeks
			after junior prom, back when she'd been dating Harrison. It hurt her
			to read how upset Sam had been about Harrison picking Brooke. It had
			ruined her relationship with Harrison, which was the thing that she'd
			tried to avoid all along. It hadn't done much for her and Brooke's
			relationship in the beginning either. She skipped ahead a few entries,
			not really wanting to dwell on the negative things that had happened.
			She stopped when she found the entries that were about Sam's budding
			sexuality.</p>
		<p>Sam had taken a very journalistic approach on her road of discovery.
			She'd read about it, and watched all of the movies. In fact it seemed
			the only thing Sam had yet to do was put her experiment to practice.
			Brooke ignored the slight feeling of relief she got at that thought.
			She could read all of Sam's frustrations, hopes, concerns, and fears,
			and for a moment, she wanted to walk into the journalist's room and
			wrap her arms around her, but she couldn't. Sam could never know she'd
			found this journal. She was just about to stop reading the entries,
			when she came across a few that caught her attention. It seemed that
			Sam had a crush on someone. She read on, and discovered that whoever
			this mystery girl was, it was someone who went to Kennedy High with
			them. She tried to read the entries closely, looking for hints as to
			who it was. Sam had been very clever in keeping the identity a secret.
			She would only descried a smile that was thrown her way or a faint
			brushing of the hand in the hallway.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Why would I be mad at you?</tt>
		</p>
		<p>The AIM window popped up out of nowhere, earning a startled gasp from
			Brooke.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: You were online and didn't message me. You also
				declined my offer to study together earlier tonight.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: Oh...well I only signed on to get the French
				notes for our homework assignment. I wasn't ignoring you, and I'm
				certainly not mad at you. I just really needed to get it done.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Oh ok...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: So, what are you doing? I could be there in two
				shakes, and we could hang out.</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke panicked. The last thing she wanted was Sam here as she read
			her diary.</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Actually, I'm about to turn in. My test...</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>LoisLane082884: That's right, your test. Say no more...I'll see
				you tomorrow. Goodnight Princess :p</tt>
		</p>
		<p>
			<tt>QueenMcBitch: Goodnight, Mucky :p</tt>
		</p>
		<p>Brooke quickly closed her window, and shut her computer off, just in
			case Sam decided to stop by anyway. She walked down the hall to the
			bathroom to brush her teeth and wash her face. Sam's journal had
			certainly been an eye opener. Tomorrow she was determined to figure
			out who Sam's crush was.</p>
