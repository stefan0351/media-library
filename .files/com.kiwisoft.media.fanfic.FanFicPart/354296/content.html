<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 37: Impact -->

<P>B’Elanna dropped her hyper-spanner for the third time. "Damn it," she said as
she climbed down to retrieve it. She was in her complete exposure suit, and the
helmet visor kept fogging over. "Tell me again why we need to wear these damn
things? The station’s atmosphere is fine. Environmental controls weren’t
damaged."</P>
<P>"As I told you," Tach said. "When you’ve got that many small chunks of rock
flying at you, you need to be ready." He tightened down a fitting and then
reached over and opened a plasma vent. "Damn," he screamed when the plasma began
leaking immediately. He turned it off and began tightening the fitting
again.</P>
<P>"If one of those things hit us, we’re not gonna’ have to worry about having a
spacesuit," she said as she went back to adjust the plasma matter-stream. "Okay,
I fixed the plasma mix. Any time you’re ready." She looked at him
expectantly.</P>
<P>"A meteor may only pierce the hull," Tach pointed out. "You’ll thank me if we
have a rapid decompression."</P>
<P>"Great," B’Elanna said with a sigh. "Did I mention that Klingons don’t do
well in zero G?"</P>
<P>"As your wife is so fond of saying, you will adapt," Tach said as he opened
the vent. "There," he said with a smile. "Now, let’s get down to the reactor and
see if we can reactivate it."</P>
<P>"I can’t believe I’m taking orders from a farmer," B’Elanna said as she
followed him out of the small corridor.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven of Nine stood at the auxiliary tactical station, ready to target any
meteors that Tuvok or Harry might miss. She wasn’t enjoying the fact that her
wife was out in the middle of the storm. Hundreds of meteorites of every size
filled the surrounding space. With B’Elanna and Tach already docked at the space
station, Tuvok had taken over the responsibility of covering it. His fingers
flew furiously over his comm panel as he tried to keep one step ahead of the
projectiles.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<p><I>Voyager</I> had turned and was facing into the meteor storm, targeting
the deadly chunks of rock as they headed for the planet or the station. The
Stellar Guard had a squadron of fighters that were taking out as many of the
larger meteors as possible. The fighters had the advantage of using Narian
targeting array. Their complex systems were centrally controlled and the Narian
command had already plotted the trajectories of the largest meteors, so they
knew which would definitely hit the planet. Those were targeted and marked on
the fighter’s targeting array. The pilots would take turns flying out to
intercept those massive targets and break them up. The problem then became
recalculating the trajectories of the broken pieces.</P>
<P>"Mister Kim," Tuvok said, his voice almost sounding alarmed. "Incoming
meteors at 123 mark 214. I will take the larger one," he said even as he was
firing.</P>
<P>"Got it," Harry responded, though his eyes grew wide when he saw the size of
the targets. "Why didn’t the Stellar Guard take these out?" </P>
<P>The phasers fired and the huge chunks of rock shattered, sending smaller
pieces directly for <I>Voyager</I>. The debris filled the viewscreen.</P>
<P>Janeway stood, keeping one hand on her command chair. "All available power to
the main deflector. Keep firing. We can’t let those pieces get past us," she
barked. She knew that Tach and B’Elanna were counting on <I>Voyager</I> to keep
the incoming meteorites at bay until they completed their repairs.</P>
<P>"There are so many," Harry said as he kept re-targeting.</P>
<P>"The Stellar Guard are handling the biggest meteors, and they are not
bothering with the ones that won’t hit the planet." Seven looked up from her
comm panel. "Mister Kim, you just destroyed a target that would have passed us
without harm."</P>
<P>"How am I supposed to know that?" Harry asked as he kept firing.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven said. She input a few more commands and then sent a new set
of data to all of the comm panels. On the main viewscreen, a green grid
criss-crossed the image. Suddenly each meteor hurling toward them had a
color-coded tracking mark beside it. "Fire on the meteors marked with red,"
Seven ordered. </P>
<P>"Thank you, Seven." Janeway stared at the screen, impressed with the complex
tracking system. It reminded her of a Starfleet war room with different markers
for ships from different alliances, though Seven’s program looked more
intricate. She realized that Seven must be plotting hundreds of courses of the
meteors and then manually updating the screen.<BR><BR>Seven nodded. "The yellow
targets are ones in danger of being pushed into the planet or the station by the
explosions. Be aware that they may change to red at any time." She glanced back
down at her console. She had divided it into two data streams. One gave her an
update on the meteors, and the other was from the scanners facing the small
space station. She had a constant image of Tach’s ship docked off of the port
side of the battered phaser cannon array. Tach’s ship was firing automatically,
keeping the stray debris from hitting the structure.</P>
<P>"Impressive," Tuvok said as he concentrated his firing on the new red
targets. A large explosion rocked the ship as debris hit the deflector grid.
Tuvok grabbed the console and kept firing.</P>
<P>"Tom," Janeway said as she sat back down. "Keep a course locked in to get us
out of here. I want you ready to move us the other side of the planet as soon as
Tach and B’Elanna are out of there."</P>
<P>"Gladly," Tom said as he double-checked the escape route he had already
plotted. "What’s taking them so long?"</P>
<P>Seven’s head snapped up. "The station was badly damaged when the ship
collided with it. Since that impact, dozen of small meteors have hit it as
well," Seven said defensively. She didn’t like Paris questioning her wife’s
efficiency, although she did wish that B’Elanna would finish soon.</P>
<P>"Captain," Harry said, he was smiling, impressed by a massive meteor he had
just destroyed. "Maybe I can knock a few of these out of our way before they get
so close." He held onto his console as the fragments hit the shields and shook
<I>Voyager</I>. "I’m firing on the three largest red targets that just came on
screen." He pushed the comm panel as he spoke. "The photon torpedoes should do
the trick."</P>
<P>"Harry, no." Janeway stood and spun. "Belay that," she glared at him and his
face went pale.</P>
<P>"I just fired," Harry said.</P>
<P>"Tuvok," Janeway yelled as she trotted up to the tactical level.</P>
<P>"I am attempting to disarm the torpedoes." Tuvok had to shift his focus back
to his targeting as a small meteor hit <I>Voyager’s</I> shields, knocking the
ship to one side.</P>
<P>"Hurry," Seven said as she tried to disarm it from her station.</P>
<P>"What?" Harry asked. </P>
<P>"Captain…" Tuvok nodded toward the screen. The largest meteor in the distance
exploded when the torpedo hit, shattering into three huge chunks that flew off
into different directions. The pieces bumped into other meteors, setting off a
chain of events like a cue ball breaking a freshly racked set of billiard balls.
Suddenly dozens of the yellow targets changed to red.</P>
<P>"Oh, god," Harry whispered. </P>
<P>Another torpedo exploded, it shattered the next meteor sending hundreds of
shards in every direction, and the explosion ignited some of the pieces. It
would have been beautiful, like fireworks on a hot July night, except these
fireworks were heading straight for <I>Voyager</I>. </P>
<P>"Brace for impact," Janeway said just as the shards hit the shields. It
sounded like water thrown into a white-hot frying pan as the meteors scattered
across the shields. "What was that?" the captain asked just as the third torpedo
hit and broke another giant meteor in half. </P>
<P>"The second meteor had a less dense construction," Seven answered as she
continued both of her scans. "It had hundreds of caverns, all filled with
hydrogen gas. The matrix of the cavern system was laced with tri-lithium and
duranium." Seven’s eyes widened. "We must warn the station," she said even as
she accessed the communications system.</P>
<P>"What? Why?" Harry asked while he tried shooting the new red targets.</P>
<P>"Janeway to Torres, get out of there, now. You’ve got hundreds of tiny
fragments headed your way and they’re made of tri-lithium and duranium. They’ll
get right past Tach’s targeting cannons and cut through your hull like hot
butter." Kathryn moved next to Seven and watched as the massive cloud of
projectiles neared the station.</P><I>
<P>*"Torres here, Captain…we’re almost done. Can you buy us ten more
minutes?"*</I> B’Elanna asked over the comm.</P>
<P>"Get out of there, now," Janeway ordered.</P><I>
<P>*"Aye, Captain,"*</I> B’Elanna said, but her tone suggested she was not happy
about it.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tom Paris yelled. "We need to get out of here too."</P>
<P>Janeway turned and saw half of the last broken meteor. It was heading for
<I>Voyager</I>, closing fast. "Hold your ground, Ensign," she ordered. She
looked over at Tuvok and he gave her a subtle shake of his head. "Harry, you
focus everything we’ve got on that… that thing. Tuvok, see if you can pick off
some of those smaller pieces heading for the station." She took a breath as her
crew jumped into action. "Tom, you keep us nose to nose with that thing until
the last second. We need to break it up. It’s an ELE," she added, reminding
everyone that if it hit the planet it would cause another Extinction Level
Event.</P>
<P>"No," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>Janeway looked down at her console as the station was peppered with impacts
and the surrounding space began filling with a white vapor as the phaser cannon
array lost its atmosphere.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Come on, Tach… move it," B’Elanna yelled as she ran toward the docking bay.
He was in front of her and she was pushing him every time he would pause. His
bulky spacesuit made him look like an overweight targh as he quickly waddled
through the station.</P>
<P>"What if we use the phaser cannons and target manually?" he asked as he
stopped to catch his breath. B’Elanna slammed into to him. Her facemask had long
since fogged over.</P>
<P>"Move," she ordered, taking him by the arm and tugging him. "Janeway doesn’t
back down easily. If she said we need to get out of here, then we do." She
trotted a few more steps, pulling him with her. "How soon can we use the
transporter?" she asked.</P>
<P>"As soon as we clear the reactor’s radiation shielding…at the end of the
corridor," he said.</P>
<P>A deafening hiss made them both stop, they looked at each other, and for a
split second nothing happened. A loud explosion replaced the hissing and they
both flew through the air. They were being forcefully sucked toward the
corridor. </P>
<P>"Hull breach," Tach screamed over the noise. He grabbed his belt, pulling off
a cable with a clamp and hooked it to a loop on B’Elanna’s waist. He took a
small pistol from his opposite hip and fired at one of the walls as they were
carried past. A duranium arrowhead with an attached cable plunged into one of
the bulkheads and the cable quickly went taut, yanking B’Elanna and Tach to a
stop. They swayed from side to side as the air was drawn out past them. After
several minutes, they both bobbed above the decking. The station was completely
silent. </P>
<P>"Kahless," B’Elanna said as she activated her magnetic boots. She stood in
the gravity free environment as Tach did the same.</P>
<P>"What do you think of these suits now?" Tach asked. He unsnapped the cable
from the wall but left the one tethering him to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I’ll tell you when we get back on board <I>Voyager</I>," she said. "Come on,
we’re almost out of the shielded area."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway saw the vapor filling the space around the station and she knew what
it meant. "Janeway to Torres, come in," she said calmly, but inside her heart
was pounding. She waited, idly listening to the sound of fingers dancing over
consoles as the crew continued firing. She glanced down at Tom Paris. He was
moving <I>Voyager</I> in reverse, giving them a little more time to attack the
giant meteor as it hurled toward them. It was also moving them closer to the
station and the atmosphere. "Janeway to Torres," she repeated. There was still
no answer. </P>
<P>Seven was tired of waiting patiently. She slapped her comm badge. "Seven of
Nine to Torres, come in…now." Only silence answered.</P>
<P>"They may be somewhere a signal can’t get through," Janeway said. "Was Tach
wearing a comm badge?"</P>
<P>"I…do not know," Seven said. She felt like she was failing her wife by not
having all of the relevant information.</P>
<P>"Janeway to Tach, come in," she said.</P>
<P>"Captain," Tuvok said calmly. "On screen."</P>
<P>Janeway and Seven turned to see the meteor glowing red in the center and then
it broke with a massive explosion that knocked Tuvok, Janeway and Kim to the
floor. Seven remained standing, but her console had deep dent where her Borg
enhanced left hand had crushed it as she held on.</P>
<P>"Well?" the captain demanded as she climbed to her feet. She stared at the
screen as the fiery explosion began to die down. Tiny pieces of rock began
hitting the shields and then the smoke and flame was gone and they could see
what was left of the projectile. The explosion had torn off three smaller pieces
that were flying in the opposite direction. The remaining chunk was closing on
<I>Voyager</I>.</P>
<P>"Captain?" Paris asked from the helm.</P>
<P>"Steady, Mister Paris," Janeway answered. "Shields to maximum," she ordered
as she went to the helm. She knelt next to him and began altering the ship’s
course.</P>
<P>"Ma’am?" Paris asked, his voice cracking. "We’re still in that thing’s
path."</P>
<P>"I know that, Mister Paris," Janeway said without looking up. "We just need
to alter its trajectory a tiny bit."</P>
<P>"Captain," Seven said from her post, "This ship, even with shields at
maximum, will not alter its course. The shields will buckle a nanosecond before
the hull implodes."</P>
<P>"Steady," Janeway said to Paris as he moved in his chair. "Get ready to pivot
us as the meteor gets closer. Try to match its speed," she added. "Once we are
touching, we’ll just give it a little nudge."</P>
<P>"Ma’am," Tom said slowly. "That thing you want to nudge is twenty times
<I>Voyager’s</I> size."</P>
<P>"Twenty six," Tuvok corrected.</P>
<P>"Just what I needed to hear," Paris said. The meteor filled the screen as it
rushed closer. Tom managed to get the ship’s shields within a few meters of the
projectile and he matched its speed, hovering just off of its edge. He gave
Janeway one last questioning glance, then let the shields nudge the huge rock.
The entire ship rocked and the engines began to whine as Tom followed the
captain’s orders and tried to push the meteor. The whine from the engines
increased and Tom wished B’Elanna was in Engineering; she could always get the
warp core to give a little more power than Starfleet engineers had ever
intended.</P>
<P>Seven continued hailing both Torres and Tach. Her scans showed nothing
because the tri-lithium particles scattered around the station had blocked out
all of the readings.</P><I>
<P>*"Vorik to the bridge… We have lost two power conduits and the engines are
overheating,"*</I> the Vulcan said over the comm. </P>
<P>"The meteor’s trajectory is unchanged," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Vorik, get repair teams on it, Janeway out," the captain said. "All right,
Tom, back us off." She turned and faced the officers at the back of the bridge.
"Seven, check that thing for structural integrity. Are there any weak
spots?"</P>
<P>Seven quickly re-scanned the meteor. "Yes, there is a fissure near the center
of the last explosion. The resulting crater has a deep crack that continues into
the interior."</P>
<P>"Tuvok, I want one torpedo, minimum yield. Put it right into that fissure,"
Janeway said.</P>
<P>"I might point out that a torpedo is exactly what caused this," Tuvok said
while he targeted the crater.</P>
<P>"I know," Janeway said. "But this thing wasn’t even going to hit the planet
until we interfered. I am not going to stand by and watch an ELE hit their
planet when we can at least break it up."</P>
<P>"Torpedo ready," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Fire." Janeway sat in her chair and waited as the torpedo went to the meteor
in a lazy arc. There was small explosion and then the huge rock seemed to
vibrate and then split into a several smaller pieces. "Target those," Janeway
ordered. One piece was bigger than the rest and it headed directly for
<I>Voyager</I>. "Tom," Janeway said harshly.</P>
<P>"Got it," Tom responded as he spun <I>Voyager</I> out of the way. He wasn’t
quite fast enough and the meteor bumped the ship. </P>
<P>"Shields are failing on decks four through nine," Tuvok said.</P>
<P>"Captain," Seven yelled as she stared down at her console. "The station."</P>
<P>"On screen," Janeway said. The rear view filled the screen as the largest
chunk of the meteor that had hit <I>Voyager</I> continued on toward the station.
It dwarfed the station, and continued directly toward it. "Janeway to Torres,
come in." She watched in horror as the meteor hit the station and Tach’s ship
along with it. The station and ship were crumpled like discarded paper cups,
collapsing on impact. There was a small explosion as Tach’s fuel tanks ruptured
when the meteor continued into the atmosphere taking the wreckage with it. It
glowed bright red, then white, before becoming engulfed in flame, the whole
thing taking only a few seconds.</P>
<P>Tuvok looked up as the ship was rocked by a small meteor hitting the shields.
"I suggest a hasty retreat," he said quietly.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She scanned the surrounding space. "We must find Lana," she
insisted. Her hands flew over the controls as she tried different methods of
scanning. Each one showed nothing but she blamed the tri-lithium. "We will find
them," she insisted.</P>
<P>"Tom…" Janeway put her hand on his shoulder. "Take us to the other side of
the planet."</P>
<P>Tom could not answer, so he nodded. He keyed in the commands and the ship
moved quickly toward the opposite side of the planet and the safety it offered.
With the planet between <I>Voyager</I> and the meteor storm, they would be as
safe as possible.</P>
<P>"I will find them," Seven said quietly as she tried modulating the scanners.
"They may have used escape pods." She noticed her vision was narrowing, she
could only see the tiny area of her console, and everything else was black. She
felt a warm touch on her arm but didn’t look up.</P>
<P>"Seven," Janeway said gently. "Come on, I think you and I should have a talk
in my ready room."</P>
<P>"After I locate B’Elanna and Tach," Seven said. "I must continuing scanning."
</P>
<P>"I will continue scanning," Tuvok offered from his post. </P>
<P>Seven glanced over at the Vulcan and considered his offer. "Very well, but
contact me when you find her," she finally said.</P>
<P>"Come on," Kathryn said as she wrapped her arm around Seven’s waist. The tall
blonde hesitated before slowly moving toward the ready room. Janeway looked back
at Harry who seemed dazed as well. "Mister Kim, contact Chakotay in Engineering
and have him report to the bridge. Until then, you have the bridge." </P>
<P>"Aye, Ma’am." Harry stared at Seven. He had never seen her look so completely
lost.</P>
<P>"Easy," Kathryn said when Seven stumbled. "I’ve got you."</P>
<P>"Do not tell B’Elanna I tripped," Seven said as she leaned onto Kathryn for
support. "I am always teasing her about being clumsy. She would enjoy returning
the favor."</P>
<P>Kathryn led Seven into the ready room and guided her to the couch. "Sit,"
Kathryn ordered.</P>
<P>"I should be helping to find B’Elanna." Seven sank into the soft cushions of
the couch.</P>
<P>"Seven," Kathryn said as she sat next to her friend. "You will get through
this. You have so many friends on board. You don’t have to do this alone. We’re
here for you." She reached out and took Seven’s delicate hand. "I’m here for
you."</P>
<P>"I am never alone," Seven pointed out as she looked into Kathryn’s eyes. "I
have B’Elanna."</P>
<P>Kathryn took a deep breath and sighed. There were parts of her job that she
truly hated. "Seven, you saw the station… you know B’Elanna’s not coming
back."</P>
<P>"You are wrong," Seven yelled and jumped to her feet. "You cannot give up on
her. She is not… gone. She promised me that she would come back. B’Elanna would
never break a promise to me."</P>
<P>"She didn’t mean to," Kathryn said as she stood. "It was an accident."
Kathryn tried to take Seven’s hand, but the exdrone yanked it away.</P>
<P>"I am her wife… she would not lie to me," Seven yelled. Her eyes began to
shine as tears formed but refused to fall.</P>
<P>"She didn’t lie… she just made a mistake," Kathryn said quietly. "I never
should have let her go."</P>
<P>"You could not have stopped her," Seven whispered as tears began sliding down
her cheeks. "Please, leave me alone," she requested. "I do not wish to have you
see me like this," she added as her hands began to shake.</P>
<P>"You shouldn’t be alone right now." Kathryn tried to put her hand on Seven’s
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Leave," Seven yelled. Her eyes were wild and feral and she clinched her
hands into tight fists until her knuckles turned white.</P>
<P>"All right," Kathryn said slowly, "But I’ll be right outside if you need
me."</P>
<P>"Go," Seven said huskily.</P>
<P>"I’ll be back in ten minutes to check on you," Janeway said as she paused
near the door. "You aren’t going to do anything…"</P>
<P>"I will not harm myself," Seven said quietly. "I would never harm our
child."</P>
<P>"Call me if you need anything." Kathryn opened the door and left Seven
alone.</P>
<P>"I need my Be’nal," Seven whispered as the door hissed shut.</P>
