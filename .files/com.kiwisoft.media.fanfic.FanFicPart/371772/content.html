<P><B>yes, i know, it's been very, very, very, VERY long since i've updated. i'm sorry. senior year is harder than i thought it would be. anyway, here is your next chapter. enjoy (hopefully) :)</B></P><P><B>oh, and by the way, i was kinda unclear on where lilly came from (school/city wise) so let's just say that lilly and oliver have gone to miley's school all along and she just never ran in the same circles. thus, making the GSA that oliver and lilly met at at Miley's school :) hope that wasn't too confusing!</B></P><P>So, today is the first day I have to return to school, post-new soon-to-be step-sister. Of course, we're going to ride together in her car. Robby Ray and Blondie are making us. And, as I've come to learn, Oliver and Lilly are a packaged deal; thus, we'll be riding as a trio. So now when we arrive, all my friends are gonna look at me like I'm a loser. Great.</P><P>"Miley, hurry up! I won't be late to school because of you!" Lilly knocked on the bathroom door; well, more like pounded. I put the finishing touches on my black eyeliner and pulled some of my pink streaks out from under the rest of my hair to make them more obvious. Then I swung the door and found myself face to face with Lilly. Our noses were less than an inch from touching. My breath caught in my throat and I'm pretty sure my heart stopped beating. A strange look crossed over her features before she took a few huge steps back. "Let's go."</P><P>"Fine, Two Shoes," I said, then put on a fake, high-pitched voice, "We'd better not be late!"</P><P>She just rolled her eyes and headed out, not waiting to make sure I was following. I grabbed my black, bulky messenger bag and headed out of my room, shutting the door behind me. I quickly walked out the door, ignoring the parentals necking in the kitchen. Robby Ray had about a cow and a half when he saw my hair, but then again, that's exactly the reaction I'd wanted.</P><P>Lilly was already waiting for me in the car, the engine idling, ready to go. I got in and she backed out of the driveway without a word. It almost seemed as if she was...mad at me.</P><P>"Lilly?" I called.</P><P>She didn't respond.</P><P>When we pulled up to Oliver's house, she honked her horn for him, and I stared at her face, studying it, trying to figure out what was up. She wouldn't meet my gaze. Oliver came out wearing a soft pink polo, collar popped, and light-colored skinny jeans. His hair was its usual, perfectly straightened self. He had on a belt that had rainbows all over it. I mean, come on. He has to know how ridiculous he looks. He got in the backseat without protest and Lilly backed out before he'd even buckled his seatbelt. He shot me a look in the sideview mirror, but I didn't say anything, only shrugged.</P><P>"If you guys are going to have an eye conversation about me, at least do it when I'm not around," Lilly said suddenly. In the silence of the car, it sounded too loud.</P><P>Oliver and I sat silently until we arrived at school. Lilly parked the car and leapt out almost as soon as she cut the engine. Oliver and I both got out slowly, shutting our doors, and then the car beeped to signal that it was locked. I glanced in Lilly's direction and saw her drop her arm from above her head while carrying keys in it. She must've locked it from there.</P><P>"What did you do?" Oliver asked.</P><P>"Me? I didn't do anything. Maybe the bitch is just PMSing."</P><P>"Well, what did you say to her this morning?"</P><P>"Nothing important. She said she didn't wanna be late so I called her a goody two shoes. Our same usual witty banter."</P><P>Oliver looked apalled. "Please tell me you didn't."</P><P>"Didn't what? I don't understand. Explain yourself, Tinkerbell."</P><P>"You can't call Lilly a goody two shoes."</P><P>I paused for a second. "Why the hell not?"</P><P>"Oh, God. Calling her a goody two shoes is like calling me a fag; that's how offensive it is to her."</P><P>"Why?"</P><P>"It just...is. Okay?"</P><P>He stalked off, probably to go talk some sense into Lilly. "No, it's not fucking okay! I wanted an explanation!" I shouted to his back. He ignored me, just kept on toward Lilly.</P><P>I watched him whirl her around before walking into the doors. He used a lot of big gestures, flailing an arm in my direction. She glanced over but kept her arms crossed over her chest. Then, she dropped them to her sides and heaved a sigh. She was shaking her head while he was nodding his. Then, she was nodding her head while he was shaking his. Finally, strangely enough, he drew her into a hug. They had the strangest conversations ever.</P><P>I strolled across the parking lot, then went into the building through the doors farthest away from them. Too bad that still didn't keep them away.</P><P>"I'm sorry," Lilly said from behind me. "I didn't mean to get so upset."</P><P>"Then why did you?"</P><P>"I just...I'll explain later. I gotta go to biology." She headed off without another glance behind.</P><P>"She's over it." This time, Oliver had popped up beside me.</P><P>"You know, it's weird, it's almost like you two consider me part of your little group now."</P><P>He stopped and looked at me. "We do."</P><P>I stopped a little ahead of him and turned around. "Well, don't." I continued to english, not looking behind me to see if he was following.</P><P>...</P><P>"You all have been studying Shakespeare since your freshman year, possibly earlier. We all know that he was born in Stratford Upon Avon. We all know he had three children, and that his only son died at age 11. It is common knowledge among us that he had a wife named Anne Hathaway. But how many of you knew that Shakespeare was not straight? By a show of hands, how many of you knew that he had a love affair with the Earl of South Hampton? And that most of his romantic sonnets were written about men?" My english teacher, Mr. Slipstone, was a Shakespeare buff.</P><P>A few of the thespians raised their hands, but no one else did. A couple of guys whispered lewd comments to each other and laughed, giving each other high fives. One of them said, "Hah! Shakespeare was a fag." Another one replied, "Duh, man. I mean, what straight guy would write <I>Romeo and Juliet</I>?"</P><P>I wanted to slap them. Straight men could write epic love stories, too. It would just consist of a lot more ass-slapping and football and "dude." I twirled a pink streak around my finger, smacking my gum.</P><P>"Ms. Stewart, you know you're not allowed to chew gum in this facility."</P><P>I blew a big bubble, then drew the air back in and sucked the gum back in my mouth.</P><P>"Get rid of it, Miley."</P><P>I chewed one last loud smack, cracked it loudly one last time, then grabbed it out of my mouth and stuck it under his desk. "I got rid of it. Happy?"</P><P>The class, of course, was very amused by my actions. Snickering ensued.</P><P>"Principal's office."</P><P>"I know."</P><P>I got up, grabbing my bag and slinging it over my shoulder, then left the room. I found the pack of gum in my bag and popped another piece in.</P><P>...</P><P>"Miley, must you come to my office every day?" Principal Harte asked me. I hated him. He was bald and rotund.</P><P>"I figure it's a good routine. Why mess it up?"</P><P>"You do realize that all of this is documented in your record." It wasn't a question, it was an accusation.</P><P>"Cool. Does that mean it's like a foot thick?"</P><P>"You have your own drawer in my filing cabinet."</P><P>"Sweet." I kicked my combat boots onto his desk. "That's gotta be like a record right?"</P><P>"Not one to be proud of, Miley. You've got to straighten up your act or you're not going to get into college." I found his word choice ironic.</P><P>"Eh, I figure I'm lucky if I graduate."</P><P>"In fact, that would be quite the miracle. This is your senior year, is it not?"</P><P>"Aww, come on Alfred, I figured you'd know me well enough to know the answer to that question."</P><P>He pushed my boots off of his desk. "Miley Stewart, I'm afraid that you won't be graduating this spring."</P><P>"What?" I leapt out of my chair, towering over his desk.</P><P>"Ah, not so apathetic now, are we?"</P><P>"How is that even possible!"</P><P>"Let's see...," He opened my drawer and flicked through quite a few papers. "You haven't attended classes enough, therefore you haven't received credit. The classes that you do attend, however, you don't participate in or do the assignments. Yet again meaning you don't receive credit."</P><P>"But it's only September! I can still make enough credits to graduate by the spring, can't I?"</P><P>"With your work ethic, Miley, no. Something has to change or I'll be seeing you again next year."</P><P>I cannot believe this is happening to me.</P><P><I>Fuck.</I></P><P><B>so there you have it. i have some interesting things planned for this story if i can ever squeeze in the time to write it (which i will, because i'm very attached to this story). so i hope you've had fun reading. please leave your comments in a review. i'll try to post another chapter tomorrow but no guarantees. sorry, loves!</B></P>
