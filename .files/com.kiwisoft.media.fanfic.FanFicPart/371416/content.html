<p>A/N- (bangs head against keyboard) I'm surprised some of y'all aren't standing outside my door with shotguns or looking through my windows! (well, there have been those, but those are just the people that stalk me for me my hot bod... Or at least that's what I tell myself...). For reals, I surprise myself at how long I can go without updating. I need to keep better track of myself!</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"Who's gonna bring that blood and pain!" Duke was shouting to get the team pumped. The team was roaring in response, Viola taking the opportunity presented to her. "I said who's gonna bring that blood and pain!"</p>
<p>"PAIN!" Viola was shouting through gritted teeth. Of course, nobody heard her.</p>
<p>"Ah, hell!" Viola groaned in frustration as she limped around the field. The game was just starting, and the expected tension between the two rival teams brewed underneath the surface to a boiling point. All the players on the field were in their top physical condition after many weeks of training in preparation of this game. All except Viola, it seemed, whose back was so whacked out she couldn't even run or kick the ball properly. It was embarrassing as hell, especially since she had wanted to kick Justin's ass to prove her point. Coach Dinklage was yelling at her from the sidelines, her teammates kept sneering at her in frustration. Sweat beaded on Viola's forehead as she attempted to give her all to the game. But the crowed just laughed as she tripped and landed hard on her ass.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you doing?" Duke asked as he helped her to her feet. "I didn't help you into first string so you can slack off during the game." Viola's cheeks flamed in humility at her captain's chastisement.</p>
<p>"Sorry, it's just..." she hesitated in telling him about her injury. If they knew, they'd take her off the field! She shook her head instead and walked away from Duke's concerned gaze. She wouldn't be able to forgive herself if she let a little pain stop her from achieving her goal. Even if the pain felt like Godzilla was using her spine as a chew toy.</p>
<p>.-.-.</p>
<p>Olivia had her head buried in a thick book. She seemed oddly focused for someone sitting in very occupied and very excited stands for the soccer game. Despite the gathering excitement and cheers from students and fans, the blonde kept reading as if she was in a quiet library studying for the exam of her life. Even though the stadium was steadily filling for the game that was gathering in intensity, the area around her was steered clear of like an invisible perimeter was set up between the obstinate-appearing girl and the charged atmosphere.</p>
<p>She didn't have to eavesdrop on people's comments to know that Viola was playing badly. It just made her eyes narrow more in concentration. Her eyes roved the page ardently until her eyes finally stopped at one spot and her eyes widened.</p>
<p>"EUREKA!" she stood up and shouted, causing everyone around her to pause in surprise when the previously quiet girl had such an outburst. Olivia didn't seem to notice the incredulous stares and instead took off towards the exit with purpose, thick book clasped firmly in hand. The title read <i>'Secret Ancient Chinese Healing-Techniques'. </i>The crowd idly wondered why anyone would read such a suspicious thing. However their attention was soon stolen by the cheerleaders who were pumping up the crowd for the ensuing game.</p>
<p>On the inside Olivia was smiling warmly, because now she would finally be able to be of real use to Viola.</p>
<p>.-.-.</p>
<p>"Bench." Coach Dinklage growled at Viola when the first half ended. Viola merely nodded, seemingly close to tears. The rest of the first half had been played as if she was a mentally challenged kid on the team. Viola welcomed the heavy lot of shame on her shoulders, because she felt like she had let herself and the team down. Neither team had scored a goal yet, but that didn't make her feel any better.</p>
<p>The rest of the team was jogging into the locker rooms for a short rest, Viola lagging behind because, generally speaking, she felt like crap. Her back injury was worst than ever and her mentality was in a wreck. So she didn't notice when someone reached out, grabbed her arm and nearly yanked her off her feet. "OW!" she cried as she was quickly dragged away by someone. By the hair and the booty on that blondie, she knew who it was on sight. "Olivia, what are you doing?" Viola asked in, trying to keep up with the eager girl as they ducked through cheerleaders and band members.</p>
<p>"It's okay, I got a plan!" Olivia announced as she briefly flashed <i>Secret Ancient Chinese Healing-Techniques </i>to the soccer player.</p>
<p>"That title sounds suspicious." Viola pointed out, grimacing at a particularly painful stab of pain at her back. Olivia either didn't hear her over the roar of the crowd or chose to ignore her. Olivia pulled Viola behind an inconspicuous stand. Viola was tired from the game and was still catching her breath as she leaned herself against the wall, eyes closed. "What's this about, Olivia?" she asked in curiosity. When she opened her eyes she found Olivia's face very close to her own, her sweet breath against her cheek and her breath couldn't help but catch at the proximity.</p>
<p>"Just relax." was all Olivia murmured before she kissed Viola softly on the lips. Viola's mind went blank and she gasped, opening her mouth to Olivia's eager lips. Then Viola felt the tip of her tongue against her own and a noise escaped her throat. Her back pain's dull ache was shoved into the backseat of Viola's mind by Olivia's mouth and all that came with it. And when Olivia's hands were suddenly forming heat trails on the naked skin of Viola's lower back under her soccer jersey, she felt like she could jump out of her own skin just to get closer to her.</p>
<p>Viola was so caught up in dizzying pleasures that she did not feel Olivia fingers strategically placing themselves on specific points along her lower vertebrae.</p>
<p><i>crack!</i></p>
<p>"Ow!" Viola shouted at the sudden flair of pain in her back. "What was that?" Viola experimentally rolled her shoulders and hopped a bit. Miraculously, she was pain free! "Godzilla is gone!" she exclaimed happily. Olivia smiled, pleased with Viola's relief.</p>
<p>"Thank goodness that worked, there was a fifty percent chance that I would of just made it worse." Olivia whispered to herself.</p>
<p>"What was that?" Viola asked while performing a few lunges.</p>
<p>"Nothing." Olivia said sweetly, pushing the thick Chinese book behind her with her foot. Hopefully she wouldn't be needing that anymore.</p>
<p>Viola felt so ecstatic with an energy she hadn't felt in a while. She couldn't help but laugh with joy at how weightless she felt. "Olivia!" Viola glomped her girlfriend with a wide grateful smile. "Thank you for slaying Godzilla! I can definitely beat Justin now!" she proclaimed as Olivia tried not to stumble from Viola's enthusiastic hugging.</p>
<p>"Don't thank me, silly," Olivia said when she gained her balance. "I was the one who caused it, so it was the least I could do." Suddenly Viola unwrapped her arms around her girlfriend when a loud roar from the crowd was heard.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey! How much time do we have until the second half!" she asked giddily. It looked as if she was emitting energy from her stance and gaze, making Olivia pause and blush at how cute she looked just then.</p>
<p>"Um, should be a few more minutes-" Olivia was caught off when Viola's lips swooped to capture hers unexpectedly. Not that she minded.</p>
<p>.-.-.</p>
<p>Around the same time on the other side of the campus Sebastian was having a surprisingly difficult time evading his hunters. Unlike his sister, athletics were not exactly his strong point. So bad in fact that'd he make a complete fool of himself if he ever stepped out into a field. As he a result he wasn't a very fast runner, and tired easily. And his pursuers were surprisingly persistent.</p>
<p>"Stop, imposter! You stole away my precious Olivia!"</p>
<p>"Viola, you'll pay for making me think that Sebastian broke up with me!"</p>
<p>"<b>Just because you don't like heels, doesn't mean you should go to such extents to avoid them</b>!"</p>
<p>"How many times have I told you? (huff) I'm not Viola, I'm SEBASTIAN! (puff) Why would we even be mistaken?" It was at that moment, as distracted and exhausted he was, he stumbled in his run and fell. The swarm was on him in a second. Sebastian screamed like a little girl.</p>
<p>"Calm down, for the love of God!" the bald guy was saying as Sebastian valiantly struggled out of their holds. He eventually succeeded (Monique being a girl and Malcolm just being a pussy), and he took a few steps away from them, breathing deeply.</p>
<p>"What the hell is wrong with you people?" Sebastian yelled at them in bewilderment. Honestly, it was only his second day of school and he was already being chased by a pack of weirdoes. One of them his ex. The group of three seemed for the first time a bit hesitant at his angry outburst. It was the Headmaster that cleared his throat first.</p>
<p>"I hate to break it to you like this, er, <i>Sebastian," </i>he said his name with air quotes. "But... You're not a boy. You're<i> Viola</i>, a <i>girl</i>." Headmaster Gold said very slow but very deliberately.</p>
<p>"You're making fun of me, aren't you?" Sebastian said in an annoyed tone.</p>
<p>"We know you're very confused, Viola, but it's the truth. You are a girl!" Gold tried to convince him. Sebastian almost felt like laughing.</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous! I'm a boy. A<i> boy.</i>" He couldn't believe he ever had to insist on the validity of his gender.</p>
<p>"Prove it, then!" Malcolm threw in with a smug grin.</p>
<p>"Okay then." Sebastian said mockingly back before he unhesitatingly pulled down his pants.</p>
<p>"Sebastian!" Monique squeaked. "It really is you!"</p>
<p>"Oh dear god." Malcolm mumbled in sickness. He had been hoping he would get to see some girl parts since the only ones he'd ever seen was when he was watching through Olivia's window-</p>
<p>"<b>MALCOLM!" </b>Gold had raised the bullhorn to shout into Malcolm's ear. The guy looked about ready to cry while Sebastian was still standing before them with his hands on his hips and a very proud smirk adorning his face that screamed 'I told ya so.' <b>"IS THERE ANYMORE LIGHT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHINE ON THIS SITUATION?"</b></p>
<p>"N-Nothing more than has already been shown..." Malcolm said weakly. Sebastian barely got his pants back up when Monique was already glomping him.</p>
<p>"Sebastian!" she said in her frilly voice as she hugged him around the waist. "I'm sorry I thought you didn't have a penis! Forgive me?"</p>
<p>"It's over, Monique. We're done." Sebastian put his hands up between him and her to stop her advancement on him. Monique's hands flew to her mouth and she gasped in shock.</p>
<p>"Noooo! Not again!" Monique weakly beat on him with girly fists of fury before bursting into tears. Sebastian and the two other guys stood around awkwardly as Monique sniveled all over herself.</p>
<p>"Er, I guess we should, uh, leave you to it.<i> Dude</i>." Gold said with a nervous laugh, punching Sebastian friendlily on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Don't touch me."</p>
<p>"Right, you got it partner!" Gold just laughed in an even more awkward manner.</p>
<p>"Hey, do you hear that?" Malcolm finally spoke up.</p>
<p>"Be quiet you!" the bald Headmaster chastised.</p>
<p>"No really, listen!" Malcolm insisted. Against their better judgment, they listened. And what they heard confused them all greatly.</p>
<p>"Hastings! Hastings! Hastings!" a crowd chanted in the distance. The group seemed to pause.</p>
<p>"That's from the soccer game, isn't it?" the bald Headmaster asked.</p>
<p>"But isn't Sebastian right here?" Monique pointed out obviously.</p>
<p>"We're not looking for Sebastian. We're looking for Viola!" Malcolm said dramatically with his fist in front of him as if a bolt of lightning would strike in the background to solidify his point. The others stared at him.</p>
<p>"I hate to agree with losers, but the nerd has a point." Monique said grudgingly. If she was going to get anything at all out of this, it would be to make Viola suffer.</p>
<p>"To the soccer game!" Gold yelled before charging off enthusiastically. Malcolm ran after the guy in the dorky suit. Monique followed, but much less hyped than she had been before. Sebastian stared after them for a couple of more minutes. He briefly wondered if he would ever get rid of his 'wtf' look on his face ever again.</p>
<p>"Viola, what the hell have you been doing under my name?" he growled before eventually following the other three under pure curiosity.</p>
<p>.-.-.</p>
<p>The Illyria team was emerging from the locker room, refreshed for the second half of the soccer game. Coach Dinklage was yelling insulting encouragements at them as they filed onto the field.</p>
<p>"Coach, let me back in the game." Sebastian suddenly materialized next to the coach, nearly scaring the daylights out of him. For some reason Sebastian was emitting sunshine and rainbows even though the coach had booted him from the game earlier.</p>
<p>"Sorry, no can do." Dinklage said firmly after giving the young man an odd look.</p>
<p>"Ah, c'mon you awesome coach of a coach you!" Sebastian was slapping the older man in the back in a friendly manner. "I've changed!" he stated confidently.</p>
<p><i>'The bastards about to shit butterflies</i>.' Dinklage thought briefly at Sebastian's beaming and overconfident demeanor. He certainly couldn't deny that the boy had changed between the first half and now. <i>'I wonder what happened</i>?' he idly wondered before he nodded to the player.</p>
<p>"Alright, go. Kick, KILL!" he yelled after the teen who was already bounding onto the field like a floating gazelle. <i>'Floating... Gazelle?</i>' The old coach shook his head at the crazy thoughts entering his head in the middle of a very important game.</p>
<p>Viola couldn't stop smiling. Being pain free was certainly exhilarating! A few minutes ago she had been mercilessly kissing Olivia into a moaning pile of goo before suddenly dashing away as soon as she knew the second half was about to start, yelling "Death to Cornwall!" as she ran, and leaving a dazed girlfriend in her wake.</p>
<p>The field looked so clear to her, and everyone seemed to be moving in slow motion. Another exhilarated smile escaped her parted lips as she raced across the field like nothing, stealing the ball effortlessly from the Cornwall team and charging the goal at break-neck speed.</p>
<p>The players from both teams were very surprised at Sebastian's sudden lightning strike comeback. The defense particularly as Sebastian sailed past them seemingly effortlessly and launched the ball towards the net with a powerful kick. The stadium held its breath for the brief second, watching the ball fly towards the net... crashing right into Justin's face. Hard. The ball smacked into the goalie's face so hard his head flew back from the impact and dropped to the ground holding his face which no doubt now had an angry red mark right between his eyes.</p>
<p>"Huh, I wonder if that was on purpose?" Viola muttered to herself in slight satisfaction as the crowd roared in apparent approval of the attack. She shrugged and ran up field in anticipation of the counterattack.</p>
<p>"Welcome back to the game, Sebastian!" Duke said in an approving smile as he nimbly ran next to her briefly. "You had me worried there for a bit!"</p>
<p>Viola smiled widely back, "As if I'll miss this chance. I half to beat these guys, ya know!" she responded confidently. In a combined play, the two forwards stole the ball back and after an assist from Viola, Duke managed to score a goal. The Illyria team jumped around the duo excitedly yelling their heads off. Duke lifted his shirt mockingly at Justin and did a celebratory back flip. Viola was about to do the same thing until she realized that wouldn't be such a good idea.</p>
<p>A few minutes after that the Cornwall team had managed to have the ball under their control and they were on the offensive. The crowd held its breath as they got dangerously close to the net and it looked as if they just might score a goal. Nobody noticed a blur of movement of Viola moving up field just in time to block the ball with her body, effectively keeping Cornwall from evening the score.</p>
<p>"Hastings has the ball!"</p>
<p>Viola single-handedly charged up the field in a ballsy counterattack, miraculously bypassing every line of defense to the goal. Viola raised her foot for a mighty kick and the ball flew in a perfect arch... right into Justin's face again.</p>
<p>"Sonovabitch!" Justin cried, holding his nose. The crowd in red was roaring in hilarity and the cheer "Hastings! Hastings! Hastings!" was starting to form.</p>
<p>"Goal!" Viola smirked to herself. She couldn't help it, his face looked so damn stupid, she just HAD to kick the ball into his face.</p>
<p>"Hey Sebastian!" Duke trotted up to her. "How about actually getting the ball in the net next time?" he suggested a hint of a smile on his lips.</p>
<p>"Haha! That's probably not the first time Justin got balls to the face!" Andrew shouted.</p>
<p>Toby gave him a weird look. "You would know, right?"</p>
<p>Andrew's face turned really red as his jaw dropped at Toby's comment. "I don't want to hear that from the guy who has a crush on Eunice!"</p>
<p>"Screw you, dude!"</p>
<p>The brief time of remarks afforded Justin the opportunity to run up the field toward Viola and shoved her angrily.</p>
<p>"What the hell man? This about your stupid sister? 'Because we can have this conversation right now!"</p>
<p>Duke stepped in between them. "That's enough! Go back in the net!"</p>
<p>"Or what, you're gonna hit my fist with your face again!" Justin was pushing his forehead against Duke's before shoving his face. But before Duke could react, Viola's foot was coming into contact with the side of Justin's head in a flying kick. If you squinted, you could see the wide smile on her face as she did it. The kick was the flicker that caused a flame on both sides as blue and red clashed with fists.</p>
<p>The crowd was going nuts with cheering the name "HASTINGS! HASTINGS! HASTINGS!"</p>
<p>Eventually coach Dinklage was able to dig his way through wrestling boys to get to the ones at the center, which was Viola on Justin's back hitting him on the head repeatedly while Justin flayed about. The coach ripped the two parties apart.</p>
<p>"If you have your differences, settle them out of my stadium! Else get on with the game." he growled at them before releasing their jerseys from his grasp. "Acting like a bunch of girls!" he commented as he walked off. Viola's amused glance followed him off the field.</p>
<p>"Hey! Are you alright?" Olivia suddenly appeared on the field, obviously worried from the brawl. "You didn't hurt yourself again, did you?" Viola grinned at her.</p>
<p>"Feeling better than ever, Liv! I'm kicking Justin's ass left and right, nothing could possibly ruin this moment!" she proclaimed proudly, easing Olivia's fears. Duke raised a brow at his roommate. Why was Olivia acting all worried over her ex when he saw her making out with his sister last night?</p>
<p>However before they were able to get on with the game, a trio with a bullhorn stepped onto the field. "Time out!" Principle Gold called out as he walked onto the field, Monique and Malcolm trailing closely behind. The soccer players that were still picking themselves up from the brawl stared at the Principle curiously, wondering what his business that he could interrupt the game was.</p>
<p>"What's this about?" Dinklage asked a barely concealed edge of irritation in his voice. The two teams formed a small crowd around them.</p>
<p>"Well, uh, why don't we let Sebastian here tell you himself? Sebastian, son? I mean, uh," Gold was stumbling under Dinklage's glare. "Is there anything you would like to tell us?"</p>
<p>Viola stared blankly at him. After a couple of heartbeats she gasped. He couldn't possibly mean THAT, could he? She glanced behind him at Monique's wickedly giggling figure and Malcolm's smug mug. Yep, it was very possible he was insinuating THAT. The fact that she wasn't Sebastian at all.</p>
<p>Viola shared a glance with Olivia, who was standing by her side. The blonde had obviously had the same thought as her and was looking up at her in alarm. She looked adorable, Viola decided with a soft smile. The smile seemed to confuse Olivia who raised a questioning eyebrow. After a moment of consideration Viola nodded her head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"You know what? Yeah, there is something I would like to say." Viola said to Gold, surprising him and the two behind him. "I just can't do this anymore." Viola said more to Olivia than everyone else. Olivia took a deep breath and nodded her head in support and flashing a grateful smile.</p>
<p>"Everyone, listen up!" Viola started with a loud voice. "I'm not Sebastian... I'm Viola!"</p>
<p>(cricket chirps)</p>
<p>Duke coughed into his fist. "Um... What?" This was coming out of left field for all of them!</p>
<p>"The girl's team at Cornwall got cut," Viola started explaining as she started peeling off her fake sideburns. "So I decided I would come to Illyria as my brother, Sebastian, so I could join the soccer team here and prove a point to my ex, Justin." She pulled off her wig and shook out her long chestnut hair. The guys around her gasped at the unexpected revelation. Duke appeared slack-jawed in shock.</p>
<p>"The guy you kicked out of the room last night was actually the real Sebastian who had come back without my knowledge while I was making out with Olivia here, which you apparently saw," Viola gestured behind her at Olivia who waved at a now blushing Duke. "And I sucked during the first half of the game because of a back injury I sustained last night." Viola tried to think of something else to say. "Um, yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm sorry for any inconvenience I've caused, Headmaster Gold." she nodded in acknowledgement at the flustered man.</p>
<p>"W-well, ah... That was easier than I thought it would be!" Gold said with a laugh. Monique scowled in disappointment at the lack of drama.</p>
<p>"Wait, just because you wear a wig, doesn't prove you're a girl." Duke pointed out. He had been living with this person for the past couple of weeks, there was no way..! Though, it did explain a lot of things.</p>
<p>"Ok then," Viola started to lift up her shirt.</p>
<p>"HELL TO THE NO!" Olivia yanked Viola's shirt back down. As if she'll let Viola show her goods to Duke, let alone the entire school population! "Look, she's a damn girl, just take her word for it!" Olivia said with a flushed face. Duke and the crowd of players were blushing profusely. They believed her now, even without proof.</p>
<p>Viola looked at Olivia sheepishly. "Sorry, got caught up in the moment."</p>
<p>"Caught up, my ass! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?" Olivia said in exasperation. Viola's gaze softened and she gathered Olivia into her arms, ignoring the crowd.</p>
<p>"You know these goods only belong to you, right?" Viola stated softly, the corner of her lips pulled up suggestively. Olivia was blushing really hard now. She lightly smacked Viola on the arm.</p>
<p>"Damn you and your puppy dog look." Olivia complained halfheartedly, her mind obviously preoccupied with thoughts of Viola's 'goods'. Viola giggled and gave Olivia's forehead a chaste kiss before turning to face the rest of the crowd.</p>
<p>"So, am I still on team, Captain?" she addressed Duke apprehensively. She had revealed her secret on a whim, but she was starting to realize that it might cost her a place on the team. Duke considered her levelly.</p>
<p>"Coach said it best. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness bestowed upon them. I think we can achieve greatness today by letting you play." Duke stated with a small grin. Viola grinned back at her roommate gratefully.</p>
<p>"So, now that we've established that this boy is actually a girl, can we get back to the damn game?" Dinklage growled at Gold, pressuring the smaller man.</p>
<p>"Oh! Yes, um," he put the bullhorn to his mouth. "<b>That was a skit we... yeah," </b>he trailed off in embarrassment and just hurried off the field, dragging Malcolm and Monique behind him.</p>
<p>"Wait wait, hold up!" the coach of the Cornwall team started protesting. "There are no girls in this league, you have to forfeit! It's in the manual!"</p>
<p>"What manual?" the Illyria coach took the manual out of his hands and easily ripped it in half. "Listen here, here at Illyria we don't discriminate," he poked the other's chest with his finger. "Based on gender!"</p>
<p>The other coach rubbed the spot on his chest. "Alright, that's gonna bruise." he muttered. "Do you really think you can beat us with a girl on your team?" He had the gall to laugh in their faces (even though they had been doing just that for the whole game).</p>
<p>"This will be fun!" Justin laughed beside his coach.</p>
<p>"Hey, I get to have the last word, not you!" his coach complained as he pushed the young man away. Dinklage nodded to Viola, who nodded back in understanding.</p>
<p>"Alright guys... LETS KICK CAN!" he yelled at his team and they roared back in renewed fervor. Olivia gave an encouraging slap on the butt to Viola, who jumped but ran after her teammates with a laugh at Olivia's playfulness.</p>
<p>So far in the game Illyria was winning 1-0. Cornwall was rallying, attacking the goal with the only intention of scoring with only a few minutes left on the clock. All attempts were successfully thwarted by Illyria, and the ball eventually was passed back to Viola. A player in blue suddenly slid in front of her to steal the ball, knocking her over instead and earning them a penalty kick.</p>
<p>Viola placed the ball in front of her and backed up a few paces. Justin was in the net, taunting her with childish words and saying something along the lines of "he was getting bigger". But Viola was much too focused to pay attention to his crap. She kicked, he blocked, and Duke rebounded the ball back to Viola. The brunette took the opportunity Duke gave her, and smashed the ball into the net with a mighty and dramatic ninja kick!</p>
<p>The stadium roared at the new goal scored that finished Cornwall, 2-0. Justin pounded the grass with his fists. "No! That was a lucky shot! YOU SUCK!" he shouted at her in a choked voice before he ran away crying.</p>
<p>The Illyria team swirled around Viola, picking her up and joining the crowd's chanting "HASTINGS! HASTINGS!" she cheered happily with them, sky high. When they put her down she exchanged hugs with several of her teammates before arriving at Duke.</p>
<p>He shook his head when she made a movement to tackle him happily. "Still a bit weirded out." he admitted bashfully, awkward now that he knew she was really a girl. She shrugged and held out her hand to him.</p>
<p>"Fair enough. I hope we can continue to be friends!" she said with a disarming smile as he shook her hand. He smiled back.</p>
<p>"I'm sure we will. Welcome to the team, Viola."</p>
<p>"Viola!" a masculine voice that she recognized called out to her.</p>
<p>"Sebastian!" she ran over to him.</p>
<p>"So, this is what you've been doing under my name. Could've given me heads up!" Sebastian huffed.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I'll explain this whole mess later!" Viola managed to promise before their parents showed up. After a quick argument in which the family decided to have a dinner the following night, Viola quickly disengaged from them to look for another familiar face in the crowd. The sight of Toby confessing his feelings for Eunice certainly caught her off guard, but she was thankfully distracted by arms wrapping themselves around her waist.</p>
<p>"Good game, Hastings. Think your autograph will be worth something in the future?" Olivia's breath tickled her ear pleasantly. Viola turned to face her with a thoughtful look.</p>
<p>"What do you 'in the future'? Woman, my autograph is worth plenty already." Viola smirked confidently. Olivia looked skeptical. "Besides, why do you want an autograph for? You already have my heart." Viola said sincerely. Olivia snorted lightly.</p>
<p>"Corny, but cute." They started walking away arm in arm. "So, have you finally got your revenge and you don't have to pretend to be Sebastian and we can be a normal couple now and what not?" Olivia was saying excitedly. Viola laughed and squeezed her closer.</p>
<p>"Yep! But don't worry. Sebastian will always be right here." she pointed to her chest and Olivia glared at the spot.</p>
<p>"Damn you, Sebastian!" she said to Viola's chest, sending Viola into a fit of hysterics.</p>
