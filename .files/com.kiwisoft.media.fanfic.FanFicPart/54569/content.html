<!-- Accidental Love \ Part 3 -->

<p>As much as Ronnie wanted to ride in the ambulance with Rose to provide her comfort,
			there was the Jeep to consider and the idea of leaving it in Albany overnight was an
			unpleasant one. She had not gone near the Porsche since the accident, although she did
			notice that Hans had been over the day before to start the repairs. That left her with
			either the vehicle that did well in the snow or her prized 1967 Mustang to get around with
			and the Mustang would never see the salted winter roads of Albany if she could help it.
			Reluctantly she chose to let Rose ride alone in the ambulance while she followed behind in
			the Jeep.</p>
		<p>The drive from Albany to Loudonville where Ronnie's home was located normally took less
			than fifteen minutes. The black-haired woman gave the ambulance driver a warning that he
			was not on a life or death call, and he had better do his best to avoid hitting any
			potholes on his way out of Albany, even if it meant it took twice as long to get there.
			Loudonville was an area filled with old money and old homes, most dating back to the early
			sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was often considered a rich suburb of Albany even
			though it was a separate entity altogether. The only relation Loudonville had with the
			Capital City was they were within the same county. People who lived in the prestigious
			village made it clear they were not residents of Albany in any way, shape, or form.</p>
		<p>The ride to her home was the most agonizing drive of Ronnie's life. The roads were
			typical of early December--slush and ice chunks made the ride bumpy enough but with the
			added factor of potholes, the ambulance found itself bouncing around far more than usual.
			Knowing that every bump meant pain for Rose, Veronica yelped when the ambulance hit a
			particularly large pothole just as they were leaving Albany and crossing over into
			Loudonville. The green and white ambulance bounced and shook over the uneven road, turning
			Ronnie into a nervous wreck before they finally hit the smooth streets of her hometown and
			turned onto Cartwright Drive.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Maria opened the door and stepped out just as the ambulance pulled up the driveway,
			followed closely by the bright blue Jeep. Normally Ronnie would use her remote to open the
			appropriate garage door and put her vehicle away but she had something more important to
			do. She parked in the large parking area in front of the garages and waited for the back
			doors of the ambulance to open. She did her best to stay out of the way as they brought
			Rose out, noting that beyond a few tear streaks she seemed to be none the worse for wear.
			"And I thought the hospital was cold," the young woman commented, the threadbare
			blanket and sheet doing nothing to stop the biting wind that had picked up.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry, you'll be inside and toasty warm soon enough," Ronnie replied,
			noticing out of the corner of her eye that Maria had the double doors open to give them
			maximum room to get through with the stretcher and its precious cargo.</p>
		<p>Flat on her back, the first thing Rose noticed when they entered the large structure
			was the high ceilings, dark beams against a cream colored background. She turned her head
			and her eyes widened at the sights. The living room was huge, easily larger than her whole
			apartment had been. When she felt the change in height she realized that part of the
			living room was sunken, something she had seen in magazines at the library but never
			actually seen in someone's home. The wall to wall carpeting was the same cream color as
			the ceiling, thick and plush without a single sign of matting or wear. Large dark wood
			cabinets lined one wall; Rose guessed them to be either cherry or mahogany. A set of
			stairs took up another wall. They reminded her of the stairs from the television show
			<i>The
				Brady Bunch,</i> except that instead of having a lower landing, these stairs curved around
			at the bottom. The railing was also the same deep color as the cabinets and ceiling beams.
			She heard Ronnie cursing somewhere in the background but could not locate her no matter
			how she turned her head. Then she saw her exit from a room at the far end and race up the
			stairs. Maria stepped into her line of vision and Rose got her first real glimpse of the
			housekeeper. "Hello."
		</p>
		<p>"Well hello there, you poor thing," the housekeeper replied. "Ronnie had
			to run upstairs to get some sheets. She'll be right back down."</p>
		<p>"My name is Rose." She held her out her hand.</p>
		<p>"I'm Maria, child," she replied, taking the offered hand and shaking it.
			"Once you're settled in I'll make you something good to eat. I'm sure you're sick of
			that awful hospital food."</p>
		<p>"That's very kind of you but I don't want you to go to any trouble."</p>
		<p>"Oh, it's no trouble at all. Oh, here comes Ronnie. I'd better go get those sheets
			on the bed so you can get comfortable."</p>
		<p>Maria took the linens from Ronnie and disappeared into the far room while the tall
			woman went to Rose's side. "Sorry about that," she said.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, can you do me a favor?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, what is it?"</p>
		<p>"Can you cover my feet? They're freezing." A second later she felt large warm
			hands clasp around her ice cold toes, the only part of her lower extremities not encased
			in a plaster cast.</p>
		<p>"Why didn't you say something?" Ronnie looked up and glared at the ambulance
			attendants while adjusting the sheet and blanket to cover the exposed feet. Maria stepped
			out of the room a few minutes later, announcing that everything was all set. "We'll
			get you in bed and then I'll run upstairs and get you a pair of nice warm socks,"
			Ronnie said before backing out of the way as the attendants took hold of either end of the
			stretcher.</p>
		<p>It only took a quick look around for Rose to realize that the room she was being put
			into was Ronnie's office. Two tall file cabinets were pressed up against the wall,
			apparently to make room for the queen sized bed sitting in the middle of the room. A
			computer desk with the largest monitor she had ever seen was against a near wall and an
			immense television took up the remaining wall where she could see it comfortably. </p>
		<p>"Okay Mike, you ready?" The one attendant asked, gathering the sheet beneath
			Rose in his hands. "On three," Mike replied.
			"One?two?three." They easily lifted her up but in the process of
			putting her back down, one corner slipped out of his hands, causing the heavily casted
			right leg to flop down onto the bed. The jolt sent a rush of pain through Rose and the
			subsequent yelp brought Ronnie over to her side. "Sorry Miss," Mike said.
			"We need to roll you onto your side now so we can get the sheet out from under
			you."</p>
		<p>"No," Ronnie said. "I'll get it." There was clearly anger in her
			tone as well as concern that Rose not be injured any further. With infinite care she
			worked the sheet out from under the young woman until it finally came free. She tossed it
			to Mike's partner. "Is there something I need to sign?"</p>
		<p>"No Ma'am. You'll receive a bill from us in a few days."</p>
		<p>"Fine. Is there anything else?" Without waiting for an answer she nodded at
			Maria, who was standing in the doorway, "Maria will see you to the door."</p>
		<p>"It was an accident," Rose said once the attendants were gone. Ronnie was
			busily reviewing the instructions on how to operate the new bed.</p>
		<p>"It was a stupid accident. He should have been more careful. What if you hadn't
			been over the bed?" She reached down and wrapped her hand over Rose's cold toes.
			"Let me get some socks for you. I'll be right back. Do you want anything from the
			kitchen?"</p>
		<p>"No, thank you. I can wait until dinner."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh. Well, I know I could use a cup of coffee. Do you want something warm or
			cold to drink?"</p>
		<p>"Um?" The look in the deep blue eyes told her that she had better pick
			one or the other. "Warm, please."</p>
		<p>"Here's the controller for the bed." She handed the white plastic device to
			Rose along with the instruction booklet. "It comes with heat and massage. Just press
			these buttons if you want to turn them on. These control the foot and the head of the
			bed." She watched as the young woman experimented, raising the head up until she was
			at a forty-five degree angle. "I'll let you get used to it and I'll be right back
			with those socks."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ronnie returned a few minutes later with a pair of thick white socks and a purring pile
			of orange and white fluff. "Look who I found hiding in the mud room," she said,
			setting Tabitha down on the bed and smiling when she saw Rose's arms wrap around her
			precious kitten.</p>
		<p>"Hi Honey?I missed you," the young woman cooed to her contented cat.
			"You've gained weight."</p>
		<p>"Mrrow?"</p>
		<p>"Did you miss me?" She hugged Tabitha again, unmindful of the tears that
			spilled out of her own eyes. "Thank you," she whispered to Ronnie. "Thank
			you so much for taking care of her for me. I can't tell you how much?" Her voice
			broke off and she gave up trying to speak.</p>
		<p>"I know," the dark-haired woman said softly. "And you're welcome."
			A week ago she would not have believed that it could mean so much to anyone to have their
			pet taken care of but now Ronnie understood just how important the four legged feline was
			to Rose. </p>
		<p>"Hey, let's get these socks on you." She moved down to the end of the bed,
			still watching the tearful reunion between Rose and Tabitha. "These were the warmest
			I could find," she said as she untucked the blanket. She gathered the cotton material
			up in her fingers and carefully slid it over the small toes of Rose's feet, then up over
			the cast-covered foot and ankle. With the heel in place, the toe portion of the socks
			flopped over, clearly showing the difference in the sizes of the two women's feet.
			"Sorry about that. I'll get you some socks that fit you tomorrow."</p>
		<p>"You don't have to do that, Ronnie. These will be fine, if you don't mind me
			wearing your socks. Besides, they have to be big or they won't fit over the cast."
			The heat emanating from the bed took more than just the chill out of Rose, it eased the
			pain in her legs and relaxed her to the point where her eyelids felt very heavy and she
			was unable to stifle a yawn. "Would you mind if I rested for a little while?"</p>
		<p>"Of course not, Rose, when you're tired, you just tell me." Ronnie looked
			over at the computer, groaning inside at the thought of the work that had been piling up
			all week waiting for her. "Will the keyboard bother you if I do some work?"</p>
		<p>"Oh no. Go right ahead. It won't bother me at all." Rose did not know if it
			would or not but she was not about to tell Ronnie that she could not do her work in her
			own office in her own home. Tabitha seemed quite content to lie down on the heated bed and
			soon fell asleep.</p>
		<p>Sleep did not come as easily for Rose, however. The clackity-clack of the keyboard drew
			her attention to Ronnie working hard only a few feet away. There were computers at the
			public library and she knew how to use them to look up the location of books but little
			else. Even from this distance she could see that Ronnie was looking over some kind of
			spreadsheet. Though the sculptured face was turned away from her, Rose had no doubt that
			the head of Cartwright Corporation was frowning. A pencil with the end well chewed found
			its way into Ronnie's mouth again and again. When it was not being gnawed at, it was being
			bounced up and down on the desk, an apparent nervous habit. Every so often an incongruous
			expletive would spew forth from the cultured woman's mouth and the screen on the computer
			would change from one spreadsheet to another.</p>
		<p>Ronnie stood up and walked over to the file cabinets, pulling out wads of computer
			generated reports. "What the hell are you doing, Tommy?" she asked the air
			before returning to her seat and comparing the information on the paper to what the screen
			was telling her. Through half-closed eyelids Rose continued to watch her new friend
			struggle to make sense of what she was looking at. Several times Ronnie leaned back in her
			leather chair and let out a frustrated sigh. It was those times that Rose could see her
			face, brow furrowed with thought, lips pursed, jaw clenched. The young woman finally fell
			asleep wishing that she could do something to ease Ronnie's problems the way the gentle
			woman had eased hers.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie shut the monitor off and turned in her seat to find Rose sleeping, Tabitha by
			her side. The orange and white feline was busily cleaning her paws and did not even bother
			to look up when the executive left the room.</p>
		<p>"How is the poor dear?" Maria asked when Ronnie entered the kitchen.</p>
		<p>"She's sleeping right now. I'll wake her up when dinner's ready." She reached
			into the cupboard and retrieved a glass before taking a beer out of the fridge. "I
			really appreciate you staying late today to do that."</p>
		<p>"Oh, it's no problem at all, Ronnie, you know that," the older woman said.
			"What happened to her?"</p>
		<p>"She was hit by a car. She has no family and no one else to take care of her.
			She's going to stay here until she's completely healed and I don't need my mother and
			sister knowing about this," Ronnie warned, wanting to avoid any family discussions.</p>
		<p>"I take it she is Tabitha's mother?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah." She took a sip of beer and sniffed at the oven. "Smells
			good."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh and it will be good once it's done. Don't even think about sneaking in
			there and taking any." Maria remembered far too many times when forkfuls of dinner
			were found missing by the time she removed it from the oven. "You didn't tell me what
			she liked so I made a pot roast."</p>
		<p>"Oooh. Sounds good." Ronnie's eyes lit up. "Hope you made plenty."
			She took another sip of beer and looked around at the rows of cabinets. "Do you know
			where that tray is that we used when Mom was sick?"</p>
		<p>"Of course I do. Unlike you, I know my way around the kitchen."</p>
		<p>"Hey, I know where things are. I found the beer with no problem." Ronnie
			grinned.</p>
		<p>"Always the smart aleck, aren't you, Veronica Louise?"</p>
		<p>"Only with you, Maria," the tall woman replied, leaning over and giving her
			beloved housekeeper a peck on the cheek and ruffling the salt-and-pepper hair. "I'll
			take my dinner in the office with Rose. If you need help just give me a yell."</p>
		<p>"Considering that I served your entire family when everyone lived here I think
			bringing two dinners into the office won't be a problem." She opened the oven door
			and poked at the roast and potatoes with a large fork. "Now you go see to your guest.
			Dinner will be at least another half hour."</p>
		<p>Once she was alone again in the kitchen, the smile left Maria's face. She walked over
			to the sliding glass doors and peered out into the night. The large sodium lamp
			illuminated the garage?and the battered Porsche sitting inside it. "Oh
			Veronica?" she whispered. "What have you done?"</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"That was delicious," Rose said for the umpteenth time, putting her fork down
			on the empty plate. "I never cared much for carrots but those were terrific."</p>
		<p>"I think Maria puts some sugar on them while they're cooking," Ronnie
			replied, taking the tray off of the blonde's lap and setting it on the desk. "You
			ready for dessert?"</p>
		<p>"Dessert?" Green eyes lit up.</p>
		<p>"Dessert. I know she has fresh brownies out there and if I look real hard there
			might be some ice cream to go with them." The look of utter delight on Rose's face
			brought a smile to her own. "You keep that up and Maria will make you as big as a
			house. Nothing pleases her more than seeing people enjoying her cooking." She glanced
			at the young woman still in her blue and white hospital gown. "Of course you look
			like you could use a little meat on your bones, so that might not be such a bad thing.
			While I'm at it, I'll get you something a little more comfortable to wear than that
			thing."</p>
		<p>"Oh, well I guess it is a little drafty," Rose replied, tugging the material
			up over her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"I don't think I have any pants that are big enough to go over those legs but I'm
			sure I have a nightshirt somewhere. I'll be right back." She picked up the empty
			plates and left the room.</p>
		<p>"Meat on my bones?" Rose queried Tabitha once Ronnie left. "I feel like
			I've gained ten pounds from all the food I've eaten the last few days."</p>
		<p>"Mrrow?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, you look like you've been enjoying some of Maria's cooking too," she
			grunted when the orange and white cat climbed over her thigh to rest on her lap. "I
			don't understand it." She scratched absently behind Tabitha's ears while voicing her
			thoughts. "She finds me on the street, takes me to the hospital, and that should have
			been it. Instead she takes care of both of us like we were the most important things in
			the world to her."</p>
		<p>"Mrrow?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, heaven forbid I stop scratching you, your majesty." She resumed her
			gentle scratching. "You I can understand." She lifted Tabitha up to her chest
			and nuzzled the soft fur. "You're so adorable. Anyone who sees you falls in love with
			you." She listened to the soft purring for a minute, taking comfort in holding her
			precious kitty. "Nope, I don't understand it at all. I'm grateful but I don't
			understand it."</p>
		<p>"Here we go," Ronnie said as she entered the room. Each hand held a dessert
			plate with a large brownie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream pierced by a spoon while a
			pale maroon nightshirt was slung over her shoulder. She set the plates down on the desk
			and handed the nightshirt to Rose.</p>
		<p>"Dartmouth?" The young woman asked, holding the shirt up in front of her.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. I got my Bachelor's from there and my Master's from Stanford," Ronnie
			said as she handed one plate to Rose. "It's old and faded but I still love it."</p>
		<p>"What are your degrees in?"</p>
		<p>"Mmm, good brownie. Let's see?I have a Bachelor's in Business Administration
			with a minor in Marketing and my Master's is in Business Management."</p>
		<p>"No wonder you're the president of your company."</p>
		<p>"Well, that and I'm the oldest," Ronnie grinned. "When it comes to
			Cartwright Corp., nepotism will get you everywhere."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure it took more than that to get where you are," Rose replied,
			spooning the tasty dessert into her mouth.</p>
		<p>"It did, but if I were with any other company I'd just be middle management. My
			father died less than three years after I graduated and I took over the reins then."</p>
		<p>"Oh. Were you close to your father?"</p>
		<p>"I guess." She shoved the last piece of brownie into her mouth. "I was
			the oldest and for a long time the apple of his eye. You know, it's funny, no matter how
			busy he was, he always found the time to attend every parent-teacher conference, every
			play, even made all of my little league games. Not many men in his position would do
			that."</p>
		<p>"Sounds like he loved you very much."</p>
		<p>"He did. I was a hell-raiser and he was always trying to keep me out of
			trouble." Ronnie set her plate down and leaned back in her leather chair. "I
			remember more than one time when one of Mother's antique vases would get broken with my
			roughhousing and he would take the blame." She smiled at the memory. "Only once
			did I get hurt and he couldn't cover for me. I was sliding down that banister out there
			and fell off. Broke my arm good. Mother grounded me for the whole summer."</p>
		<p>"If you grew up here, why doesn't your mother still live here?"</p>
		<p>"Well, after Dad died, she did live here for a while. Eventually she started
			spending more and more time with her canasta friends. They all live in a retirement
			community nearby. She figured that if she was spending all of her time there why not just
			live there, so we bought her a condo and I took over the family home. It makes sense,
			though. She is pushing sixty and doesn't need such a big place anyway."</p>
		<p>"Your sister and brother didn't want the house?"</p>
		<p>"They didn't have a choice. I'm the oldest. That's how it works in our family. You
			done with that?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, yes, thank you." Rose handed over the now empty plate.</p>
		<p>"Besides," Ronnie continued. "Susan and Jack have a nice house a few
			miles from here and Tommy seems to prefer apartments. If I hadn't taken it, we probably
			would have put the place up for sale." She stacked the two plates and swiveled around
			in her chair to face the large screen television. "So it's almost ten. You tired or
			do you want to see what's on?"</p>
		<p>"No, I'm awake. That nap earlier helped." Rose shifted and inhaled sharply.
			"I do think it's time for another Percocet, though."</p>
		<p>"I'll get it. You find something for us to watch."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Tabitha was contentedly sleeping next to Rose, who continued to stare up at the
			ceiling. Ronnie had gone to bed a half-hour before, leaving the young woman alone with her
			thoughts. It surprised Rose to realize just how disappointed she was when her friend
			announced that she was going to bed. She had truly enjoyed the evening and the older
			woman's constant attention. It also seemed that when Ronnie was around, her legs and ankle
			did not ache as much or drive her to tears quite as often. She thought back to what had
			happened just after they started watching the late news. </p>
		<p>One wrong move sent agonizing pain through her and immediately Ronnie had been there.
			Ronnie, who held her tight, who whispered comforting words, who gently rocked her. Rose
			did not want that embrace to ever end. She wanted to continue to feel the warm skin
			against hers, to breathe in the scent of Ronnie's perfume, to feel the rise and fall of
			the strong woman's chest against her cheek. When Rose finally did let go, it was with
			great reluctance and a sense of loss. She adjusted the pillow behind her head and forced
			her eyes to close, but it did nothing to erase the feeling of Ronnie comforting her.</p>
		<p>Upstairs, Ronnie was staring at her own ceiling. She did not want to leave Rose, but it
			would not have looked right for her to keep the still recovering woman up too late. She
			listened to the sounds of the night, the occasional truck going down the main road, the
			owls hooting in the distance. None of that interested her. What she was listening for was
			the soft, melodic sound of Rose's voice calling out to her. </p>
		<p>"Damn, I should have gotten an intercom system," she muttered into the
			darkness. What if Rose needed help with the bedpan? What if she woke up and needed more
			Percocet? Was it safe to leave Tabitha with her? What if she walked across Rose's legs?
			What if she was in pain again and needed to be held? Those and a dozen more questions
			passed through her mind, all convincing her that upstairs was not the right place to be.
			With the office door open to let Tabitha in and out in case she needed the litter box,
			surely there was no way that she would miss hearing Rose. But what if she did? What if
			Rose needed her and she did not hear her call? Yes, that was why she had to be closer to
			her?just in case she needed anything. Grabbing her pillows and blanket, Ronnie left
			her bedroom and headed downstairs.</p>
		<p>Setting the bedding on the leather couch, she quietly crossed the room and peeked in on
			the sleeping woman. After satisfying herself that Rose was fine, Ronnie returned to the
			couch and laid down, sleep taking hold within minutes.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie was up and about by six o'clock. She returned her bedding to her room and
			changed into her spandex workout clothes before popping into the office to check on Rose.
			The young woman was still sleeping soundly so she felt safe in heading downstairs to get
			in her workout. However, what normally meant wall shaking decibels of 80's music was
			changed to absolute silence lest she miss hearing Rose call out for her. What was normally
			twenty repetitions with each machine turned into ten and the skiing machine was ignored
			altogether. She ran back upstairs and checked in on the sleeping woman one more time
			before going to take a much needed shower. It was Saturday. There would be no sign of
			Maria who had the weekends off. It was up to Ronnie to figure out what to make for herself
			and Rose for breakfast.</p>
		<p>As the steaming water rinsed the shampoo from her hair and the sweat from her body,
			Ronnie's eyes closed and her mind drifted back to the fair-haired woman sleeping
			downstairs. There had been an almost guilty pleasure in holding her last night, knowing
			that she was the one responsible for the pain, yet also the one to provide comfort from
			that pain. She enjoyed holding Rose, burying her nose in the spun gold hair, wrapping her
			arms around the soft body, feeling the warm breath against her neck?</p>
		<p>Ronnie's eyes flew open and she looked down to discover her soapy hand fondling her own
			left breast. She quickly rinsed off, mentally chastising herself for fantasizing when she
			had much more important things to do.</p>
		<p>Rose awoke to the sound of Ronnie entering the room, a plate full of pancakes and bacon
			in each hand. "I'm not as a good a cook as Maria, but at least I didn't burn
			anything."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure it'll be wonderful."</p>
		<p>"Do you want coffee or tea?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, coffee would be great," Rose said happily.</p>
		<p>"There's a fresh pot made. Cream and sugar?"</p>
		<p>"Just cream please."</p>
		<p>"One coffee, cream, no sugar coming right up." She set her plate on the desk
			and Rose's plate on the tray before placing the tray on the young woman's lap. "We'll
			have breakfast and then I'll help you get cleaned up. The nurse won't start until Monday
			but I think I can help you."</p>
		<p>"You know I really hate feeling helpless like this," Rose said. "I mean,
			I can't even lean forward without it hurting my legs. If I don't think and wiggle my toes
			that's even worse, not to mention the whole bedpan thing." Her cheeks flushed
			slightly with embarrassment.</p>
		<p>Ronnie did not know what to say to that comment, knowing that if the roles were
			reversed she probably would not be as good about the whole situation. "I'll be right
			back with the coffee and after breakfast I'll see if I can find that Trivial Pursuit
			game." She headed for the door only to be joined by Tabitha.</p>
		<p>"Mrrow?"</p>
		<p>"And I suppose you want your breakfast too?" She received her reply in the
			form of the feline rubbing against the leg of her sweatpants. "Come on, if you're
			eating that means you won't be bugging your mother for some of hers."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Although Ronnie had helped Rose last night with the bedpan, the young woman was still
			highly self-conscious of having the rich and powerful woman helping her. Not a word was
			spoken as the pan was slipped under her, she did her duty, and Ronnie took it into the
			adjoining bathroom.
			<i>Well at least I don't have my period</i>, Rose thought to herself,
			dreading the fact that it was only a week or so away. She had no idea how she was going to
			handle that when it came up.
		</p>
		<p>"All right, I suppose we should get you cleaned up. Do you want a Percocet now or
			after?" Ronnie asked when she returned from the bathroom with a basin full of warm
			soapy water and a cloth.</p>
		<p>"After. They put me to sleep too easily. Do you think we could cut the pills in
			half? I mean, I know that Doctor Barnes wants me to take them for the pain but I hate
			feeling so dopey all of the time."</p>
		<p>"I don't see any reason why not," Ronnie replied, setting the container on
			the desk. "Let's get you cleaned up. I'll be as gentle as I can," she promised.</p>
		<p>Indeed the dark-haired woman was extremely gentle, as if afraid to cause the slightest
			amount of pain. "Okay, if I get your back can you get the rest of it?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah." Rose leaned forward and pulled the Dartmouth nightshirt up and off
			her body, laying it in front of her breasts. Firm fingers under the soapy washcloth worked
			their way across her back, drawing an unexpected groan from her lips.</p>
		<p>"Did I hurt you?"</p>
		<p>"No, sorry. I guess my back hurts from lying on it so long."</p>
		<p>"I used to get the worst cricks in my back after studying all night during finals.
			My roommate was great at backrubs." Ronnie's mind briefly thought back to some of the
			other things Christine was good at. "Anyway," she said, pushing the image from
			her mind, "She showed me what to do. Can you lean forward a little bit more?"
			The young woman complied and Ronnie put the washcloth aside. She shifted slightly to get a
			better position and began kneading the tight muscles with her long fingers.</p>
		<p>"Oh, that feels good," Rose murmured sleepily, leaning back into the gentle
			massage. It seemed that every ache, every knot in her back melted away under Ronnie's
			touch. The soapy water made the strong fingers slide even easier across her skin.
			"You're in the wrong line of work, Ronnie. You should have been a masseuse."</p>
		<p>"Is that so?" she murmured, her attention focused on the soft skin beneath
			her hands.</p>
		<p>"Absolutely," Rose groaned as firm pressure was placed on a particularly sore
			spot. "You're gonna put me back to sleep if you keep that up."</p>
		<p>"Well, we wouldn't want that now, would we?" She picked up the washcloth,
			wrung it out, and cleaned off the rest of Rose's back. "Okay, I'll leave you to
			finish up while I look for Trivial Pursuit."</p>
		<p>Once Ronnie was out of the room, Rose set the shirt on her lap and washed the rest of
			her upper body and personal areas. She had just finished and was pulling the shirt over
			her head when the blue eyed woman returned. "I found?oh, sorry." Ronnie
			shut the door quickly. "Let me know when you're ready," she called through the
			closed door, the sight of Rose's firm breasts teasing her mind. That was one thing she did
			miss since putting in her own private gym. When she had been going to the local health
			club, there were lots of good-looking women running around the locker room in various
			stages of undress. It was easy for her to covertly eye their bodies and enjoy the sights
			without being noticed. Ronnie let out a sigh of disappointment at what she could not
			have?could never have again. Her experience at Stanford had seen to that.</p>
		<p>"Okay," Rose's voice called out. She entered to find the bedridden woman's
			upper body covered up by the Dartmouth nightshirt, her lower body hidden beneath the
			blankets. "You found it?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, sorry about barging in without knocking. I wasn't thinking."</p>
		<p>"It's okay. I'm sure you've seen half-naked women before."</p>
		<p>"Well, I still should have knocked." Ronnie looked at the small tray.
			"Hmm?that's not going to be big enough to play on."</p>
		<p>"You know, if you put the leg rests up on that wheelchair, I'm sure I could play
			at a table with you."</p>
		<p>"You think you're ready for that?"</p>
		<p>"Well, they put me in one to change the sheets on my bed at the hospital. I'm sure
			if we're careful we could do it."</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Rose. I don't want to hurt you," Ronnie said hesitantly.</p>
		<p>"I'm in pain most of the time anyway. I don't think it'll make much
			difference." She looked up at piercing blue eyes and smiled. "I really do want
			to play with you."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure about this?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sure. Besides, that way you can give me a tour."</p>
		<p>Ronnie hesitated for a moment, weighing the dangers of moving Rose and trusting that
			the young woman knew what her limits were. "All right, but if you feel tired or want
			to lie back down you tell me immediately, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>It required bringing the chair up against the bed and pulling Rose into it but they
			were able to do it with a minimum amount of discomfort. Fortunately, the renovations
			Ronnie had done when she took over the house included nice wide doorways. With the
			exception of the sunken part of the living room, there was no place Rose would not be able
			to go on the first floor. "Are you ready for your tour?" Ronnie asked after
			double-checking to make certain the afghan tucked under the fragile legs would not
			interfere with the wheels.</p>
		<p>"Absolutely," Rose replied, reaching for the wheels only to find that she was
			already being guided out of the room, Ronnie's hands on the handles. The office was off
			the living room and now upright, Rose saw even more of the magnificent area. Classic oil
			paintings hung on the walls. An antique coat rack stood near the door along with an
			umbrella stand that looked far too elegant to hold an umbrella. Every piece of furniture
			matched, from the trim on the leather sofa to the end tables to the cabinets that lined
			the wall. "It's beautiful," Rose whispered in awe.</p>
		<p>"It's pompous," Ronnie replied. "I only leave it this way because I
			don't want to listen to what my family would say if I changed it. Sometimes we have to
			have functions here and I'm sure that the Monet goes over far better than a Witherspoon
			would." She noted the lack of response from the young woman. "Witherspoon is an
			abstract artist. I have some of her works hanging in the game room."</p>
		<p>"You have a room just for games?"</p>
		<p>"It's a throwback to my father's time. He used to entertain some of his more bawdy
			friends there. It's got a pool table, a bar, dartboard, that kind of stuff. It's over
			here. I'll show you."</p>
		<p>Between the office and kitchen was a door, hidden under the stairs. "This is it. I
			haven't been in here in quite some time until today when I went looking for the Trivial
			Pursuit game. Maria doesn't even bother cleaning in here because it's never used, so don't
			mind any dust you might see." Ronnie stopped pushing the chair, stepped in front, and
			opened the door.</p>
		<p>There was hardly a speck of dust in the room, despite the warnings. Rose heard a click
			behind her and the room lit up with a series of hanging lights, all proclaiming one brand
			or another of beer as being the best. On the far left wall stood a fully stocked bar. The
			center of the room sported a claw-footed pool table with crushed green felt and the right
			end of the room had a few small tables complete with ashtrays. "It's just like a
			bar."</p>
		<p>"Pretty much. Dad used to retreat in here with his friends when he needed a break
			from the stuffy business world. I learned to play pool right on this table." She ran
			her fingers across the felt in memory. "During prohibition, my great-grandfather ran
			a makeshift speakeasy out of here, just for important clients, of course." She walked
			to the far wall and pointed at a small buzzer. "This was the warning bell. Grandpa
			used to use it to warn when my grandmother was coming and years later my father did the
			same thing."</p>
		<p>"Wow," Rose said, truly amazed at the history of the room. She reached over
			and ran her fingertips along the smooth wooden side of the pool table. "I'm surprised
			you don't spend time in here. It seems like a wonderful room."</p>
		<p>"It is, but I'm really too busy most of the time to have friends over."
			Ronnie gripped the handles again. "Ready to see the rest?"</p>
		<p>"Sure."</p>
		<p>They left the game room and ventured around some more, Ronnie pointing out the mud room
			that led to the back driveway, the foyer, and the second bathroom on the first floor. They
			passed into an elegant dining room with a table longer than any Rose had seen before.
			"You could seat twenty people here," the young woman said.</p>
		<p>"Actually, it seats eighteen with the leaf in, but it does look rather large,
			doesn't it?"</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful." The table matched the china closets custom built into each
			corner as well as the serving cart, a wooden table with wheels and fold down side flaps.</p>
		<p>"I suppose it is. I never use it except for family get-togethers. I usually eat in
			the kitchen or in front of the computer. Come on, you haven't seen anything yet."</p>
		<p>Their next stop was the kitchen. Ronnie wheeled Rose into the center of the room so she
			could see everything in one glance. "When I took the house over, this was nothing
			more than two counters and a few cabinets. Maria and I worked with one of the best kitchen
			designers in the area to make this."</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful. It's just like those kitchens you see in magazines," Rose
			said. The colossal refrigerator sported light oak panels on the front, matching the rest
			of the kitchen's decor. A state of the art cook's island sat just off the middle of the
			room and was complete with a stovetop and sink as well as a garbage hole and built in
			cutting board. Above their heads was a wrought iron rack holding the brilliantly finished
			copper pots and pans. The opposite end of the room had large sliding glass doors that
			looked out at the driveway and the garages beyond. The entire kitchen was finished with
			oak, copper and steel with lots of light, giving an airy feeling to the area. "What's
			that door?"</p>
		<p>"That leads to the laundry room. It's nothing exciting, I never go there."</p>
		<p>"A room just for laundry? Can I see it? I mean, if it's not too much
			trouble."</p>
		<p>"It's no trouble at all, Rose," Ronnie said, smiling at the obvious approval
			in the young woman's gaze and voice. She guided them to the medium sized room. Calling it
			a laundry room was a bit of an understatement. Beyond the requisite washer and dryer, it
			also held the ironing board, several shelves to store off-season clothing, a cabinet with
			everything from fabric softener and detergent to spot removers and dryer sheets, and a
			counter to sort clothes on.</p>
		<p>"This house is amazing. If I lived here, I'd never want to leave." Her eyes
			widened at the possible ways her statement could be taken. "I-I mean, it's a really
			nice place, not that I'd?"</p>
		<p>"Relax, Rose, I knew what you meant," the tall executive said. "I don't
			like to leave here much myself. That's why everything is designed for my comfort, and
			Maria's of course." She reached over and shut the light off. "Well, that's
			it," she said as she wheeled Rose back into the kitchen. "The rest of the place
			is either upstairs or downstairs and we're not going to venture there today."</p>
		<p>"It's really a beautiful home, Ronnie."</p>
		<p>"Thank you. I'm glad you like it," she replied, taking Rose's approval of her
			home far more seriously than she had taken anyone else's before. "So you up for that
			game of Trivial Pursuit or what?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, that table in the dining room is too high for this chair," Rose said
			apologetically.</p>
		<p>"No problem. You think one of the ones in the game room would be a better
			fit?"</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The rest of the morning was spent in the game room where they completed four games of
			Trivial Pursuit, ending with a tie of two wins apiece. Then it was back to the office
			where they watched a marathon of Judge Judy tapes that Ronnie had stored up but had been
			too busy to watch. Tabitha kept them company, alternating between lying on the bed with
			Rose and jumping up on Ronnie's lap in the leather chair.</p>
		<p>Shortly after lunch Rose took half a Percocet and lay down to take a nap, the morning
			activities taking their toll on her still healing legs. Ronnie pretended to work on the
			computer but in truth she was just waiting for the young woman to fall asleep. When she
			heard the soft, gentle snores, she stepped away from the computer desk and knelt down next
			to the bed. She watched the steady rise and fall of Rose's chest for a few minutes before
			tucking the blanket in around her and leaving the room, making certain the door was left
			ajar.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Rose shook her head groggily and opened her eyes. It was dark out but with the short
			days of winter, she could not tell if it was five o'clock or eight o'clock. A glance at
			the red numbers on the alarm told her it was quarter to six. Her bladder told her that it
			was time for something else altogether. She sighed at the thought of having to ask Ronnie
			yet again to help her with the task. Her eyes fell on the bedpan, sitting on the small
			table next to the bed. It was within arm's reach?perhaps?</p>
		<p>Ronnie was chopping up mushrooms when she heard the blood-curdling scream. The knife
			hit the floor as she raced from the kitchen to the office as the screams continued.</p>
		<p>"Oh God?ahhh?" Rose was still crying out in agonizing pain when
			Ronnie burst in. The young woman had managed to roll onto her side in an attempt to get
			the bedpan underneath herself but in the process her left leg dropped over the right one
			and twisted, sending intense waves of pain through her ankle. "Oh God it hurts!"</p>
		<p>Ronnie wasted no time, grabbing the left foot and lifting the leg away from the right
			one trapped underneath it. She quickly got Rose positioned onto her back again. "What
			happened?"</p>
		<p>"I?I just wanted?" Her words broke off into sobs as she cried
			helplessly.</p>
		<p>"Okay now, okay." Ronnie scrambled up onto the bed and pulled Rose against
			her with one arm while reaching for the bottle of Percocet with the other. "I've got
			you, Rose?it's okay now." The cap to the bottle went flying under the force of
			her thumb. "Here now, take this."</p>
		<p>Rose took the full pill into her mouth, followed by a few sips of water to get it down.
			Her sobs eased up slightly, but her arms remained wrapped firmly around Ronnie's neck.
			"What happened?"</p>
		<p>"I?I had to go?and?and?"</p>
		<p>"Why didn't you ask me? I left the door open so I could hear you." Whatever
			Rose tried to give for an answer was lost in her sobs, the only words Ronnie could make
			out were 'sorry' and 'bother'. "Okay?I've got you," she cooed. "I've
			got you, it's all right."</p>
		<p>It was a good ten minutes before she got Rose calmed down enough to get the bedpan
			under her hips. "I think we'd better take you back to the hospital so they can make
			sure that the bones are still lined up."</p>
		<p>"I didn't hit it that hard?"</p>
		<p>"You don't know that, Rose. Even the slightest bit off and you'll have problems
			walking again, you know that."</p>
		<p>"I don't want to go back," she said fearfully. "I'm sorry, please don't
			make me go back."</p>
		<p>"Shh?I'm not making you go back. I just want to make sure you didn't do any
			damage, that's all." She pulled Rose close again. "I promise we'll only go to
			get your legs X-rayed and then we'll come back home."</p>
		<p>It was almost two in the morning by the time they returned from the emergency room.
			Ronnie was annoyed enough at the length of time it took for the ambulance to arrive, but
			she was even more angry at the hour and a half wait to get a return trip. The thought of
			purchasing a van just so she would not have to depend on others to help her get Rose
			around passed through her mind more than once. Much to their relief, nothing was moved out
			of place. Dinner ended up not being the elegant feast that she had planned but leftovers
			warmed up in the microwave due to the late hour.</p>
		<p>Ronnie got Rose settled back into bed and gave her a stern warning about trying a stunt
			like that again before tucking her in. "I'll be right here on the couch if you need
			me," she said before shutting off the light and heading for the door.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>Those words brought the dark-haired woman back to the bedside. "I know you are,
			Hon, and I know it's gotta be hard for you, but please just ask for help next time,
			okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay." There was a pause. "Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"It's time."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie drained the last of her cup of coffee and looked out the window at the morning
			sun bouncing off the freshly fallen snow. Behind her, Rose continued to sleep soundly, not
			at all disturbed by the executive's early morning activities on the computer. Ronnie set
			the empty cup down on the desk and sighed. Three hours pouring over statements and
			spreadsheets still failed to turn up anything amiss with Cartwright Real Estate.
			Contractors were paid, receipts were posted, everything looked like business as usual. So
			why did she feel so strongly that something was terribly wrong? She slumped back into her
			chair and picked up the report again. The answer had to be there. But instead of returning
			to the world of ledgers and entries, Ronnie's eyes drifted over to the bed, where the
			bright sun cast a glow around the sleeping form. "Just like sunshine," she
			whispered to herself. </p>
		<p>Time began to tick by as she continued to silently study Rose. Her blue eyes started at
			the top, noting the soft honey colored hair that framed the cherubic face. Reddish brown
			eyebrows accented closed lids with naturally curly lashes. A petite, upturned nose rested
			just above the softest looking lips. Ronnie's gaze continued downward, past the oversized
			nightshirt and down to where the curves stopped. Her eyes remained riveted on the broken
			bones hidden by the casts, reminding her just why the beautiful young woman was there.
			With a mix of guilt and regret, Ronnie turned her chair back to face the desk and buried
			herself in her work.</p>
		<p>The rustling of the bedcovers accompanied by a painful groan announced that the young
			woman was waking up. "Morning," Rose mumbled, trying to bring green eyes into
			focus.</p>
		<p>"Almost afternoon, actually," Ronnie replied, putting down her work for a
			moment and turning to face her companion. "I don't have much to offer in the way of
			brunch but if you want, I'll run out and see if I can get some Chinese food."</p>
		<p>"Ooh, that sounds wonderful." Rose's eyes lit up as if she were receiving the
			biggest Christmas present in the world. "I meant to thank you again for bringing that
			to the hospital."</p>
		<p>"It doesn't take much to make you happy, does it?"</p>
		<p>The young woman cocked her head from side to side in thought before answering.
			"No, not really. I never had much, so extras like take-out food were out of the
			question."</p>
		<p>"How long have you been on your own, Rose?"</p>
		<p>"Oh," she blushed. "You don't want to hear about me."</p>
		<p>"Sure I do." Ronnie moved her chair closer and propped her stockinged feet on
			the edge of the bed. "Come on, it'll be like a slumber party."</p>
		<p>"I don't know?"</p>
		<p>"Come on, Sunshine," she cajoled, realizing she had used the pet name only
			after she had said it. She shifted and glanced at the window. "It's cold outside.
			I'll call for delivery and you can tell me all about Rose Grayson."</p>
		<p>"There isn't really that much to tell. Certainly nothing particularly
			interesting."</p>
		<p>"Let me decide that," Ronnie urged, her eyes pleading for the young woman to
			open up. </p>
		<p>Rose looked down at the blanket for a moment, weighing her options and fears. She felt
			so safe, so cared for here. What if something she said made her new friend think
			differently of her? But?there was nothing in Ronnie's eyes to suggest she would judge
			anything that was said. Maybe if she skimmed over the details?.</p>
		<p>"Well, like I said, there really isn't that much to tell. I was almost two years
			old when my parents died in a car accident. After that I lived with my grandmother until
			she got too sick to take care of me anymore." She shrugged her shoulders. "Then
			I lived in different places until I was old enough to be on my own. That's about it."</p>
		<p>"How old were you when your grandmother got sick?"</p>
		<p>"Ten."</p>
		<p>"She was your only relative?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah."</p>
		<p>"You know this feels more like an interview than a conversation," Ronnie
			said, drawing a shy smile from the young woman. "Tell me a story about you. Tell me
			about something nice that happened to you when you were a child."</p>
		<p>"Something nice that happened to me, eh?" Rose pondered the thought for a
			moment before coming up with a suitable tale. "All right, but first you call for that
			food you promised."</p>
		<p>"Deal," she replied.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>A few minutes later the food had been ordered and it was now time for Rose to tell her
			story. "Okay, it was when I was six or seven. My grandmother came to me early one
			morning and told me that we were going someplace special. She packed us lunches and we
			took the bus for what seemed like hours. We had to switch buses a couple of times before
			we got there." Rose's eyes gleamed at the memory and her gaze was many years away
			from the office in Ronnie's house.</p>
		<p>"She took me to the zoo. Not the little petting zoos that would come to the
			bazaars from time to time but a real zoo. There were so many animals?tigers, bears,
			seals?it was incredible. We spent the whole day there and ate lunch near the cage
			with the bear cubs." She placed her hand on the older woman's ankle and leaned in.
			"My grandmother told me not to feed them but when she wasn't looking I threw the rest
			of my sandwich into their pit."</p>
		<p>"Sounds like a really nice day," Ronnie said.</p>
		<p>"Oh, it was. It was one of those perfect days when it wasn't too hot or too windy
			or anything. Grandma even had a roll of dimes to put in the machines to get those pellets
			to feed the goats." Rose leaned back against her pillow and smiled at the ceiling.
			"I fell asleep on the way back so I don't remember much of that but I do remember how
			happy I was to be walking home with her from the bus stop."</p>
		<p>"Sounds like she loved you very much."</p>
		<p>"She did," the young woman replied. "Grandma always found ways to make
			our time together nice. After the chores were done, we'd always play Monopoly or cards or
			something." Rose's eyes misted and she blinked back the pain that came with the
			memory.</p>
		<p>"My grandmothers were always scrapping with each other," Ronnie said, hoping
			that a tale of her own would help keep her friend from thinking of the sad times growing
			up. "They were both the typical mother-in-law. Grandma Cartwright never thought my
			mother was good enough and Grandmother Mitchell thought the same of my dad. You should
			have seen them at holidays."</p>
		<p>"Did you always have a lot of people around on the holidays?"</p>
		<p>"Yup, and always here, too--well, until I took over. Now the parties are held at
			Susan's house or at one of the cousin's places. But back then, we usually had thirty or
			forty people here for family get-togethers."</p>
		<p>"Wow, it must have been chaos." Rose pressed the remote button for the
			heating unit built into the bed, hoping it would help ease the steadily growing ache in
			her legs.</p>
		<p>"Chaos is a nice way of putting it. Tradition is a big thing in both families and
			of course what was a Cartwright tradition wasn't a Mitchell one. On some holidays there'd
			be fights ten minutes after everyone arrived."</p>
		<p>"Fights?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, not physical ones?usually," Ronnie grinned. "At Christmas
			usually it would start with what we were having for dinner then work its way up to how the
			tree was decorated."</p>
		<p>"You're kidding."</p>
		<p>"Nope, swear to God." She held her hand up in solemn oath. "Mother's
			family always waited until Christmas Eve to put the star on the top but Dad's side would
			put it up long before, when they put the tree up."</p>
		<p>"That seems like a silly thing for people to get upset about, especially at a time
			when they should just be happy to see each other," Rose said, realizing perhaps
			Ronnie's family was not as perfect as she thought they were.</p>
		<p>"Well, maybe it was because my family saw way too much of each other. They all
			worked for Cartwright Corp. in one form or another."</p>
		<p>"You'd think that would make them closer."</p>
		<p>"Sometimes they were too close," Ronnie replied. "It's like a soap opera
			at times. We all know what's going on in each other's lives all the time. There's no real
			privacy."</p>
		<p>"I never thought it could be so difficult. I guess, not having a family, I didn't
			see the down side to having so many people around," Rose admitted.</p>
		<p>"I never thought about how lonely it could be being an only child." The two
			women looked at each other thoughtfully as old ideas blended with newfound truths.</p>
		<p>"When I was at Dartmouth," Ronnie began, "I loved the freedom being away
			from home gave me. No curfew, no disapproving looks. It felt so good not have to answer to
			anyone or worry about my image."</p>
		<p>"I bet you were one of those who ended up spending all your time studying and
			getting good grades," the young woman ventured.</p>
		<p>"Actually, I graduated summa cum laude and was a member of the Honor Society, but
			I was also a regular at all the good parties," she acknowledged. "More for
			appearances and contacts than anything else but still, if there was something fun going
			on, I was there. That's not to say I didn't get into my fair share of trouble. For my
			sorority's senior prank, we bought a car that had been stripped by car thieves from a
			junkyard and sneaked over to the Dean's house in the middle of the night and switched it
			for his car. We parked his down the block a little ways but the look on his face was
			priceless when he came out that morning to get his paper and saw that hunk of junk sitting
			in his driveway."</p>
		<p>"Oh God, I bet he was ready to kill you when he found out," Rose said, trying
			hard not to laugh at the image of the dean looking at what he thought to be his car
			stripped down to bare metal.</p>
		<p>"I have a video of it somewhere, wanna see?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, I bet that would be funny."</p>
		<p>"I'll get it." Ronnie stood up and headed to the door. "You know, I've
			got quite a video collection. Do you like comedies?"</p>
		<p>"Love them," she replied enthusiastically.</p>
		<p>"I've got a bunch of those 'Revenge of the Nerds' and 'Porky's' kind of
			movies."</p>
		<p>"Sounds great." She looked around. "Um, but where would we watch
			them?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie looked around, only now noticing that in her haste to get the room ready for
			Rose, she did not think to have a VCR moved in. "Um?well?I guess we'll
			watch it in the living room. There's a TV just as large as this one and at least one VCR.
			If you're up to it?"</p>
		<p>Ignoring the increasing aches in her legs, she smiled and nodded. "Sure, but I
			don't remember seeing a television out there."</p>
		<p>"Oh, you'll see it." Ronnie grinned with the thought of showing off her
			prized entertainment system. When it had been installed, her mother and sister had come
			over to see it. Susan thought it was 'a bit much' and her mother thought it was 'nice' but
			Ronnie knew it was something to be proud of. After all, she had picked out each and every
			component, matching just the right equalizer with the best series of Bose 'surround-sound'
			speakers. She even went to the best appliance store in the area to personally choose her
			television. Her entertainment system was a tribute to high-end electronics and Ronnie just
			itched for the chance to show it off. </p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"You'll be all right here for a minute?" Ronnie queried. Rose was sitting in
			her wheelchair, just at the edge of the steps that led to the sunken living room.</p>
		<p>"Sure."</p>
		<p>"I need to move the couch so you can see better." The first thing she had to
			do was move the solid mahogany coffee table out of the way. It had a drawer full of
			remotes, each clearly labeled with the name of the item it operated. It also contained all
			the instruction manuals, the corners of which were dog-eared from use.</p>
		<p>Next came the couch. With an ease that spoke clearly of strength, Ronnie lifted the
			right end up slightly from the carpet and used her legs to move it until it was facing the
			center cabinet on the wall. "Okay, all set." Before Rose could yelp a protest,
			the black-haired woman stepped behind her, grabbed the wheels of the chair, and lifted
			both it and her off the carpet. Ronnie gently set the wheelchair down on the lower level.
			"Let me get the pillows for your head and then I'll help get you on the couch. That
			way you can still lie down and enjoy the show."</p>
		<p>"But where will you sit?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie just grinned. "Go take a good look at that couch, Rose."</p>
		<p>The blonde woman guided the wheelchair around to face the front of the couch.
			"Looks like a very nice couch, but?" Ronnie had come around the other side
			and sat down, reaching between the cushion and side to grab the hidden lever.</p>
		<p>"It's one of those reclining ones!"</p>
		<p>"Yup?look at this." She snaked her hand between a fold of soft leather
			and pulled, revealing a hidden snack tray nestled within the center cushions.</p>
		<p>"Oh, that is cool!"</p>
		<p>"What can I say? I like creature comforts." Ronnie said with a grin.
			"Here, let's get you settled. You'll love how soft this is."</p>
		<p>"Oooh! This is niiiice," the young woman drawled after sinking into the
			wonderful couch.</p>
		<p>"I couldn't tell you how many times I've fallen asleep on it," the proud
			owner said as she walked over to the cabinets and faced the center one. The double doors
			opened to reveal the large screen television and the racks above it filled with stereo
			equipment and a top of the line six-head VCR. She slid the doors into their recessed
			spaces before turning to face the sight of Rose comfortably relaxing on her couch.
			"I'll go get the movie and something for us to drink." She returned a few
			minutes later with sodas for both of them and a black video cassette case. "I hope
			'Revenge of the Nerds' is a good one because that's the one I grabbed."</p>
		<p>"Sounds good to me. I've only seen it once, on television."</p>
		<p>"Oh, you have to see it. They cut some of the best scenes when they edited it for
			TV." Ronnie reached into the drawer of the coffee table and picked up several remotes
			before settling on three of them. "Let's see now, I have a list here
			somewhere?" She shuffled the manuals around until she found the one with all her
			writing on it. "Here we go."</p>
		<p>A few seconds later the television was on, the tape was rolling, and crisp sound came
			from every corner of the room. Ronnie had spent months adjusting the angles of the
			speakers to best blend in with the natural acoustics of the vaulted ceiling. A satellite
			feed gave perfect digital pictures on the fifty-inch screen of the massive television. She
			had originally purchased a projection television but that now resided in the gym. It was
			replaced with the sharper picture and higher quality of a tube. The credits were just
			beginning when they heard a car coming up the driveway. "Food's here," they said
			at the same time, drawing mutual chuckles and smiles that would continue long into their
			lazy Sunday afternoon.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Monday came as it always does, forcing attentions to be turned to things of importance
			besides each other. This particular day also brought with it temperatures in the teens and
			blowing snow. Maria arrived at 7:30, half an hour late. Monday was the day she stopped at
			the supermarket first to pick up fresh milk and bread to replenish whatever Ronnie had
			depleted over the weekend. Normally was not a problem, but an accident near Routes 378 and
			9 had traffic backed up for almost an hour. Ronnie was already in the shower after her
			morning workout. As Maria made her way from the foyer, the housekeeper tossed a curious
			look at the hastily moved furniture in the living room, noting the rumpled blanket and
			pillow. "Are you supposed to be up there?" She queried the orange and white cat
			lying on them.</p>
		<p>"Mrrow?" Tabitha picked her head up at the voice and quickly followed Maria
			out to the kitchen. This was the dark-haired one that dropped the little pieces of meat
			all the time, the feline remembered.</p>
		<p>"I see you've taken over while I was gone, eh?" She set the bags down on the
			counter before tossing her purse into the drawer reserved for that purpose. Her wet coat
			went into the laundry room along with her scarf. "Well, let's see if we can't try and
			get something quick whipped up before Ronnie gets down here."</p>
		<p>"Looks pretty nasty out there," the black-haired woman said as she entered
			the kitchen a few minutes later. "Think maybe I'll take the day off and stay
			home."</p>
		<p>"Did you have a good weekend? I see you certainly left enough dishes for me."</p>
		<p>"Actually I did have a good weekend," Ronnie replied as she crossed the room
			looking for a fresh cup of coffee. "The roads are pretty nasty, right?"</p>
		<p>"Well, they're not the best but they are driveable."</p>
		<p>"But it could get worse," she said, making the statement sound more like a
			question.</p>
		<p>"I suppose it could, Ronnie. I didn't really get to see what the weather report
			said this morning."</p>
		<p>"So it could get worse out there." The executive seemed pleased with her
			reasoning. "I'd better work from home today. Wouldn't want to take the chance."</p>
		<p>"Of course not, after all you're what?eight miles from work or so?"
			Maria opened the refrigerator to survey the damage from the weekend. "Omelets?"</p>
		<p>"Sounds good. I'll go check on Rose while you're doing that."</p>
		<p>"What does she like in hers?"</p>
		<p>"I think mushrooms and green peppers?oh, and cheese, of course." Ronnie
			picked up her coffee cup and headed toward the office, leaving Maria to her tasks and
			Tabitha to follow after the housekeeper in hopes of a treat.</p>
		<p>Rose was still sleeping when Ronnie entered the office and sent an email to her
			secretary and to Susan announcing that she was going to work from home that day. Rose
			slept through the sound of the television being turned on and the constant flicking from
			one station to another. The only thing that brought her out of her dream world was the
			smell of fresh omelets and muffins when Maria brought breakfast in to them.</p>
		<p>"Knew something had to wake you," Ronnie quirked.</p>
		<p>"Mmm? Oh, morning Ronnie," she said, wiping the sleep from her eyes.
			"Morning Maria, how was your weekend?"</p>
		<p>"It was fine, Rose. How was yours?"</p>
		<p>"Good." She sniffed the air. "Oh, that smells wonderful."</p>
		<p>"Maria's cooking is always wonderful. That's why I keep her around," Ronnie
			teased.</p>
		<p>"I knew there had to be some reason," the housekeeper joked back. She turned
			her attention back to the injured woman. "How are your legs feeling?"</p>
		<p>"They ache a lot but the heat seems to help."</p>
		<p>"Good. You just do what the doctor says and I'm sure you'll be up and about in no
			time."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, as long as she doesn't try to do everything for herself," Ronnie
			chimed in. "We had to make a trip to the ER."</p>
		<p>"You did? Oh my!" Maria looked from one to the other. "What
			happened?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie filled the housekeeper in on the incident while Rose tried unsuccessfully
			between forkfuls to change the subject. The head of the house was just finishing up her
			breakfast when the doorbell rang. "That must be your nurse," she said to the
			young woman.</p>
		<p>"I'll see to her coat and then bring her in here," Maria said.</p>
		<p>A few minutes later the nurse entered the room. "Hello. My name is Karen Brown and
			I'll be your nurse," she said to Rose.</p>
		<p>"Hi, I'm Rose Grayson." She held her hand out to the nurse.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie," the executive offered.</p>
		<p>"Well, I suppose the first thing I should do is wash up and take a look at those
			stitches on your cheek." Karen looked up at Ronnie. "How long has she been
			home?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie chose not to correct the nurse about Rose's residence status. "They
			released her Friday afternoon."</p>
		<p>"Have you done any passive therapy?"</p>
		<p>"No, but she's been up in the wheelchair a little bit."</p>
		<p>"That's not passive therapy," Nurse Brown corrected. "Well then, I
			suppose we'll clean the wounds and we can get started." She glanced at Rose's cheek
			and the stitches that ran across it. "There's no sign of infection there. When are
			you supposed to go back and have your stitches removed?"</p>
		<p>"Friday. With any luck I'll be up and walking again soon."</p>
		<p>Karen pushed her glasses up on her nose. "I wouldn't get my hopes up, Miss
			Grayson. Your legs have been through a tremendous trauma. It's going to take a great deal
			of time and effort before you'll be able to get around on your own. Let's not worry about
			walking yet and just concentrate on getting you healed."</p>
		<p>Ronnie stood up and grabbed her empty cup. "I'm getting some more coffee. Do you
			want some, Rose?"</p>
		<p>"Yes please, thank you." She held out her cup.</p>
		<p>"What about you, Miss Brown?"</p>
		<p>"Oh no thanks. I don't drink caffeine."</p>
		<p>"Fine, I'll be back in a minute." She headed for the door but was stopped by
			the melodic voice.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah?"</p>
		<p>"Could you give me a few minutes?" Rose gave an embarrassed smile. "I
			have a couple of things that I need to take care of." She looked pointedly at the
			bedpan sitting on the small stand.</p>
		<p>"Oh, uh, okay. I'll be in the living room if you need me."</p>
		<p>But Ronnie did not go in the living room. Instead, she haunted Maria while the older
			woman tried to get her daily chores done. "So, you saw her, what do you think of
			her?"</p>
		<p>"She's not my nurse. You should be asking Rose about her."</p>
		<p>"But do you think that she's all right? I mean, the agency said she was a
			registered nurse. Should I have gotten more information about her? I can call Susan and
			have her run a check with the State Board."</p>
		<p>"If you think you should, Ronnie," replied Maria, the duster in her hand
			flying over the antiques. "Has she said or done anything you don't approve of?"</p>
		<p>"Well?no, not really."</p>
		<p>"Then what's the problem?" </p>
		<p>"No problem. I just wondered if I should or not, that's all," the executive
			replied, her tone slightly miffed. She stood there silently for a minute, the tension
			building within her. "I have a lot of work to do and my computer is in there."</p>
		<p>"You have another one upstairs in your room that you could use if you had
			to."</p>
		<p>"But the data I need is on this one," she lied, knowing full well both
			computers connected to the network housed at the corporate offices.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, if you need to get in there I'm sure Rose would understand."</p>
		<p>The tone in Maria's voice made the tall woman realize just how she sounded. "No,
			I'll use the one upstairs. Let me know when lunch is ready." She turned and raced up
			the stairs.</p>
