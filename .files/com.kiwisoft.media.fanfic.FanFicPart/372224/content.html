<p><b>A/N: Hi everybody. I know it's been a while since I last updated this story and I'm really sorry, but I hope this chapter makes up for it a little. As I promised back in Chapter 24, whoever could guess the song Miley was singing to her & Lilly's daughter (it was "Candle on the Water" from Disney's "Pete's Dragon") would be rewarded with an appearance in my story, and with this chapter I've (hopefully) kept that promise. <i>Knee Knee</i>, <i>Nitewolf33</i> and <i>Sophi20</i>, I hope you recognize yourselves, and that you like what I did with your characters :)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER TWENTY SIX</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">BUSINESS AND PLEASURE</p>
<p>"How are you things back in Tennessee, Lu?" Miley eagerly asked her look-alike cousin, on the other end of a long-distance phone call.</p>
<p>"Not too bad," Luanne replied. "Mamaw's still letting me stay with her, and she's been taking me to my appointments with the psychiatrist."</p>
<p>"Have they been helping you?" Miley asked carefully.</p>
<p>"I think so," Luanne said after a moment. "Just having someone I can talk to really helps sometimes, y'know? And he teaches me how to deal with some of the ugly thoughts and feelings."</p>
<p>"I'm glad, Lu; I want you to get better."</p>
<p>"I will," Luanne said softly. "It's just going to take time."</p>
<p>"As soon as we can, Lilly and I are gonna come see you," Miley promised.</p>
<p>"I'd like that," Luanne said with a smile. "I know you're really busy right now though, finishing the rest of your tour and planning your own wedding!"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have it any other way though," Miley admitted with a smile of her own.</p>
<p>"I bet Lilly helps you get through those long nights," Luanne said teasingly. Miley immediately turned a polite shade of pink.</p>
<p>"Lu!" she squeaked in embarrassment. Luanne chuckled.</p>
<p>"All right, I'll stop embarrassing you now," she smirked. "In fact, I need to get going. Aunt Dolly's coming tonight, and I'm supposed to help Mamaw make dinner."</p>
<p>"Good luck, Mamaw runs her kitchen like Captain Bligh," Miley quipped. On the other side of the phone, Luanne made a face.</p>
<p>"Trust me, I remember," she muttered. Miley giggled.</p>
<p>"Tell Mamaw and Aunt Dolly I love them," she said.</p>
<p>"I will," Luanne replied solemnly. "And thanks Smiley… for everything."</p>
<p>"That's what family is for," Miley said warmly. "Take care, Lu… see you soon."</p>
<p>"Back atcha cuz. Tell Lilly I said hi." Luanne hung up, and Miley leaned into her girlfriend's embrace with a contented sigh.</p>
<p>"So how's Luanne doing?" Lilly asked, not looking up from their latest school assignment.</p>
<p>"Better," Miley replied. "She's still a long ways to go, though."</p>
<p>"At least she's trying," Lilly said gently. Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"Thanks Lilly… I'm really glad we could help her," she said solemnly. "I know you don't like Luanne much…" Lilly looked up at her lover.</p>
<p>"Like I could change your mind anyway?" she said with a smirk. "Besides… everyone deserves a second chance. For what's it worth, I really do hope Luanne gets better." She paused and looked back down at their textbooks.</p>
<p>"By the way, I need your with this science homework. What the heck is a quark anyway?" Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"It's a' part of what makes up protons and neutrons," she replied. "I think," she added uncertainly. Lilly laughed out loud.</p>
<p>"I'm glad I'm not the only clueless one," she said with a grin. "Jackson wasn't kidding when he said these classes wouldn't be easy."</p>
<p>"Math and anthropology weren't easy either, but we got through them," Miley reminded her. "We'll survive science too."</p>
<p>"I know," Lilly replied. "No pain, no gain, right?" She paused to take in the unusual expression on her best friend's face.</p>
<p>"Everything okay, Miles?" she asked gently.</p>
<p>"Lils?" Miley asked her softly. "When we go see Luanne in a few weeks… if it's okay with you, there's something I want to ask her."</p>
<p>"Like what?" Lilly asked, concern showing in her voice.</p>
<p>"I want to ask her to be in our wedding," Miley replied carefully. Lilly's eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"Miles… are you sure?" she asked. Miley nodded again.</p>
<p>"I know it'd mean a lot to her," she explained. "I wanna show her that we care about her, and want her in our lives." Lilly smiled.</p>
<p>"Miley Ray Stewart, you are the sweetest, most selfless person I have ever known." She joined her hands with Miley's. "If it means that much to you, go ahead and invite her." A huge grin lit up Miley's face, and she practically tackled Lilly in a hug.</p>
<p>"Thank you Lils! I love you so much!" she gushed. Lilly hugged her fiancé back, enjoying the feeling of Miley's warm, loving arms around her. Unexpectedly, Miley yawned. Lilly looked at her weary girlfriend, a wry smile on her face.</p>
<p>"Tired hun?" she asked sweetly.</p>
<p>"I'll be okay," Miley managed. "Just been a long couple of months… six shows in four states. I don't know how people do these things."</p>
<p>"You've been having the time of your life and you know it," Lilly said teasingly. Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"Darn straight," she said happily. "I'll be even happier in a three more weeks… when I finally get to call you my wife." Lilly smiled.</p>
<p>"I already am," she said softly. "We're just gonna make it official is all." Smiling, blinking back joyful tears, Miley leaned forward and gently kissed Lilly on the lips.</p>
<p>"I love you, Lilly… you don't know how much…"</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miley," Lilly said warmly. "I always will." Miley fought back another yawn.</p>
<p>"I think someone needs a nap," Lilly said teasingly. Miley rested her head against Lilly's shoulder. Her eyes sparkled playfully.</p>
<p>"I might feel better if we go lay down together…" she whispered.</p>
<p>"You're bad," Lilly said with a grin. "All right, but keep your hands where I can 'em!" Miley stuck her tongue out.</p>
<p>"You're no fun," she pouted. Hand in hand, the two young lovers walked into the bedroom and climbed into bed together. As they lay there together, in each other's arms, Miley looked over at the blonde-haired angel who had come into her life and filled her heart, and whispered a silent prayer of thanks to whoever might be listening.</p>
<p>"You okay Miles?" Lilly asked when she heard Miley sniffling.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Miley managed. "Just wondering how I got so lucky…"</p>
<p>"Oh, Miley…" Lilly managed, tears stinging her eyes at her girlfriend's tender admission. Then Miley pulled Lilly to her, and there were no more words as their lips joined in a warm and wonderful kiss. They parted for a moment to catch their breath and Miley smiled.</p>
<p>"I don't know what I'd do without you, Lils," she whispered softly.</p>
<p>"I don't know what I'd do without those kisses of yours," Lilly smirked.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Miley quipped, a warm smile on her face. She leaned forward until their noses were almost touching.</p>
<p>"Close your eyes…" she whispered softly. Lilly did so without the slightest hesitation, and Miley's lips found hers again. Slowly, teasingly, she began to kiss her way down Lilly's exposed neck, grinning as she listened to Lilly's breathless gasps. Her lips were soon joined by her gentle, caressing hands, and then everything but each other was swept away as the two of them slowly made love…</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>The final concert of Hannah Montana's first tour took place at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio, on an energetic Friday night. Sitting in her dressing room just before the show, Miley fidgeted nervously with her long blonde wig.</p>
<p>"Take it easy Miles," Lilly said, smiling warmly. "You know you're gonna rock this place, just like always."</p>
<p>"Thanks Lils," MIiley replied, smiling shyly. "I really don't know how I could this without you."</p>
<p>"Well, that's something you're never gonna have to find out," Lilly answered sweetly, lightly kissing Miley's cheek. "Besides, that incredible voice of yours is your gift alone. You just needed a little kick in the butt to realize it." Miley grinned. She found Lilly's lip in a gentle kiss of her own.</p>
<p>"Don't ever change, Lils," she said softly.</p>
<p>"Have I ever?" Lilly quipped. A knock on the dressing room door startled them both.</p>
<p>"Girls?" Robbie Ray's voice called out. "You ready?"</p>
<p>"Coming daddy!" Miley shouted back. She took Lilly's hand in her own. "Come on Lils, let's do this!"</p>
<p>"That's my pop star," Lilly said with a grin.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>During the concert, Lilly stood near the side of the stage and watched the woman she loved, partially within the shadows. Something about watching Miley gleefully dance and sing filled her with a joy she couldn't even begin to describe; there was no doubt in her mind that this was what Miley was meant to do, and that she would be doing it for a long time to come.</p>
<p>"Go, Hannah!" an excited voice shouted. "You rock!" Lilly turned to look out in into the crowd and saw a young girl with dark brown eyes and bright red hair jumping up and down in excitement. The audience was obviously enjoying the performance as much as Miley was enjoying putting it on. Eventually, the song Miley was singing ended, and she took a few moments to speak to the crowd.</p>
<p>"Thank you everybody!" she called out excitedly. "I'm so glad you're all having a good time!" She paused for a moment and looked over at Lilly, smiling at her gorgeous girlfriend.</p>
<p>"If nobody minds, I think I'd like to sing a special song," Miley continued. "I want to dedicate it to my best friend Lola, who's been by my side every step of this incredible journey I've been able to take… and I owe her everything. I love you, Lola!" As the audience continued to cheer, Miley lifted the microphone to her lips and started to sing again…</p>
<p><i>All this time I was looking for love</i></p>
<p><i>Trying to make things work</i></p>
<p><i>That weren't good enough</i></p>
<p>'<i>Til I thought I'm through</i></p>
<p><i>Said I'm done</i></p>
<p><i>Then stumbled into the arms of the one</i></p>
<p><i>You're making me laugh about the silliest stuff</i></p>
<p><i>Say I'm your diamond in the rough</i></p>
<p><i>When I'm mad at you</i></p>
<p><i>You come with your velvet touch</i></p>
<p><i>Can't believe that I'm so lucky</i></p>
<p><i>I have never felt so happy</i></p>
<p><i>Every time I see that sparkle in your eyes</i></p>
<p><i>They say that good things take time</i></p>
<p><i>But really great things</i></p>
<p><i>Happen in the blink of an eye</i></p>
<p><i>Thought the chances to meet somebody like you</i></p>
<p><i>Were a million to one</i></p>
<p><i>I can't believe it</i></p>
<p><i>You're one in a million</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah</i></p>
<p><i>One in million</i></p>
<p><i>Yeah</i></p>
<p><i>You're one in a million…</i></p>
<p>The cheers of the audience echoed loudly in the large arena, and Miley took a moment to look over at Lilly again, sharing a secret wink with her. Lilly's eyes were wet with tears, but she managed a smile of her own.</p>
<p>"Thank you everybody, you're the best!" Miley called out again. "Good night, Columbus!" The cheers and shouts and calls reached a deafening pitch as Miley finally made her way backstage. Lilly met her with a hug and a quick kiss.</p>
<p>"That was amazing," she said softly. "But if you ever make me cry like that in front of a million people, I'll kill you!" she added with a tearful laugh.</p>
<p>"I meant every word," Miley said with a smile.</p>
<p>"I know," Lilly whispered. "You're gonna get it later though!" Miley's grin grew.</p>
<p>"Is that a promise?" she asked in a teasing voice.</p>
<p>"Count on it," Lilly replied in a sultry whisper.</p>
<p>"I will," Miley said, finding Lilly's hand and taking it into her own. "Right now though, I've gotta meet and greet some fans."</p>
<p>"Really?" Lilly asked excitedly. "You've got fans already?" Miley nodded, blushing a little.</p>
<p>"Don't ask me how, but yeah," she admitted. "I'm supposed to meet them just over here." They turned the corner and found themselves in what looked like a small alcove, where a couch and a few chairs had been set up. Three people were sitting on the couch. Lilly recognized one of them as the red-haired girl she'd seen in the crowd earlier. Sitting beside her as a petite girl with light brown hair and brown eyes, who immediately smiled and waved at her and Miley as they approached, and a boy with blue eyes and short brown hair who gave them a friendly nod.</p>
<p>"Hi," Miley greeted them shyly.</p>
<p>"You were awesome tonight!" the red-haired girl gushed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you rocked," the boy agreed with a smile.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Miley replied nervously. "And thanks for coming to my show, it really means a lot to me."</p>
<p>"Could I have your autograph?" the brown-haired girl asked shyly. Lilly nudged Miley playfully.</p>
<p>"Uh, sure!" Miley managed. She quickly turned to Lilly. "Where can I find a pen around here?" she whispered regently.</p>
<p>"Right behind ya bud," Robbie Ray suddenly interrupted. He appeared behind Miley and Lilly, holding a few programs and a black sharpie. For his disguise as 'Mr. Montana', he was also wearing a fake moustache and his cowboy hat. "You can sign these for your guests," he said warmly.</p>
<p>"Thanks daddy!" Miley said happily. "Oh, uh guys, this is my dad; he's also my manager." While Robbie Ray said a brief hello, Miley took the pen and quickly signed her name on all three programs, then handed them to her three young fans.</p>
<p>"I hope these'll do," she said as she handed them out.</p>
<p>"Oh my gosh, thanks!" the brown-haired girl exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Hey, can I ask you a question?" the boy asked. Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"Sure, go ahead," she told him.</p>
<p>"Were you enjoying yourself up there as much as it looked like you were?" he asked with a grin. Miley smiled as well.</p>
<p>"Actually, yeah," she answered honestly, blushing slightly. "This is all a dream come true for me. It's still hard for me to believe it all's really happening, much less that I actually have <i>fans</i>!" The three young people laughed along with Miley, Lilly and Robbie Ray.</p>
<p>"I couldn't do any of this without you guys though, so thank you, from the bottom of my heart," Miley said earnestly.</p>
<p>"Awww, that's so sweet!" the brown haired girl gushed.</p>
<p>"Well, I have to go now," Miley said, trying not get any redder than she already was. "Thanks again for coming to my show tonight, and I hope to see you guys again!" She turned to walk away, pausing for a moment to wave to the her three fans one last time. As she did so, the red-haired girl winked at her.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Lilly growled.</p>
<p>"Take it easy," Miley whispered, bringing Lilly's hand to her lips and gently kissing her knuckles. "She's just being friendly."</p>
<p>"That better be all she's doing," Lilly muttered as they turned a corner.</p>
<p>"Aw, are you jealous Lils?" Miley asked. Lilly muttered something under her breath.</p>
<p>"What was that?" Miley pressed, a mischievous grin on her face.</p>
<p>"Nothin'," Lilly retorted.</p>
<p>"Lilly, relax," Miley said soothingly. "She just gets to wink at me. <i>You</i> get to spend the whole weekend with me in a nice, secluded tent out in the middle of nowhere." She wagged her eyebrows slightly, and Lilly immediately felt her face heat up.</p>
<p>"And everything after that," Lilly managed, smiling a little. Miley nodded.</p>
<p>"For the rest of our lives," the brunette promised.</p>
<p>"Still, this weekend would be nicer if our parents and your brother weren't gonna be there too," Lilly quipped. Miley laughed.</p>
<p>"We're still gonna have fun," she reminded the woman she loved.</p>
<p>"I know," Lilly said with a grin, "cause I'm gonna be with you…"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Barely a week later, Miley, Lilly and Robbie Ray finally returned to Tennessee to carry on a Stewart family tradition: a weekend camping trip in the mountains above their home at the end of the summer. It was the first time they had attempted to revive the tradition since Susan Stewart's passing, but Miley felt she was at last ready to give it a try. Miley's older brother Jackson and Lilly's mom Heather also joined them.</p>
<p>"You gonna be okay?" Lilly asked her best friend carefully as they stood beside a sparkling stream, readying their poles to try some fishing. Miley nodded slowly.</p>
<p>"I know momma would want us to keep doing this," she said softly. "She always loved it out here…" Miley managed a smile.</p>
<p>"Besides, I get to share it with you now," she told Lilly. Lilly smiled as well, and she reached out to rest one of her hands on top of Miley's.</p>
<p>"I already know I'm gonna have a great time," she said honestly. "Even if I do catch more fish than you," she added with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Not gonna happen Truscott!" Miley laughed out loud. "I'll have you know I'm the best fisherman in my family!"</p>
<p>"Well I'm not <i>in</i> your family, am I?" Lilly challenged playfully. "Yet, anyway."</p>
<p>"Yes, you are," Miley whispered. Lilly grinned, and Miley leaned in to kiss her.</p>
<p>"Man, can't you keep your hands off each other for two seconds?" Jackson quipped as he walked up beside them. "I mean c'mon, you're gonna scare the fish!" Lilly turned and stuck her tongue out at him.</p>
<p>"You're just jealous," she retorted.</p>
<p>"Because you get to kiss my sister?" Jackson said with a smirk. "Yeah, right!" Lilly grinned. Considering how Jackson had felt about their relationship when he first found out about it, it felt good to finally be able to joke with him about it.</p>
<p>"I'll have you know, your sister is the best kisser in Tennessee!" Lilly exclaimed. "She's got gifted lips!"</p>
<p>"Can we please not talk about my lips in front of my brother?" Miley groaned.</p>
<p>"All right you three," Robbie Ray interrupted good-naturedly. "If you want dinner tonight, it's time to start earning it."</p>
<p>"Just leave it to me Mr. S!" Lilly called out, jumping to her feet. "I'll catch one so big it'll feed all of us!" Robbie Ray grinned.</p>
<p>"Well, good luck darlin'; if you can catch it, I'll cook it!" Smiling, Lilly cast her line into the stream with a flick of her wrist. Standing on either side of her, Miley and Jackson did the same. After a few minutes, Lilly felt a strong tug on her line.</p>
<p>"I've got one!" she gasped.</p>
<p>"Go for it Lilly!" Jackson called out. "Pull it in!" Grunting, Lilly set her feet and began reeling in her line. The fish put up a terrific fight, but Lilly would not be denied. Finally, with a shout, Lilly pulled it out of the water… and right down on top of her and Miley.</p>
<p>"<i>Aaah</i>, get if off of me!" Miley shrieked. Lilly, meanwhile, was too busy laughing.</p>
<p>"It's not funny, Lilly!" Miley managed, finally grabbing the fish and tossing it away from her.</p>
<p>"O-oh, you should've seen the look on your f-face!" Lilly howled. Tears were streaming down her face as she continued to laugh, and Miley couldn't help giggling as well.</p>
<p>"That's it, f-from now on, that's going to be your fish face!" Lilly cackled.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Miley managed. She very carefully picked up the slimy fish from where it had landed nearby, and before the still-laughing Lilly could stop her, she slipped it down the front of Lilly's shirt. Lilly shrieked in alarm, and wasted no time in quickly plucking the fish out of her clothes.</p>
<p>"I don't believe you did that!" Lilly exclaimed in mock-outrage.</p>
<p>"That was for calling me 'fish face'," Miley retorted, sticking out her tongue.</p>
<p>"Miley, I've got <i>scales</i> in unmentionable places now, thanks to you!" Lilly half-gasped, half-laughed.</p>
<p>"Maybe we better not share that with everyone else," Miley giggled.</p>
<p>"Too late," Robbie Ray said dryly, carefully picking up the fish by its tail. "I'll have to tell Heather to cook this one <i>really </i>well. In the meantime, maybe you two should go get cleaned up?"</p>
<p>"I'll take her to take the lake," Miley replied. She turned slightly and extended her hand to Lilly. "Come on Lils, let's go get the fish stink off us."</p>
<p>"Try not to get into any more trouble while you're there, huh?" Robbie Ray said with a small smile.</p>
<p>"No promises, Mr. S," Lilly said with a smirk. "Your daughter's one heck of a trouble maker."</p>
<p>"Then she's in good company," Robbie Ray said lightly. "Now get goin' you two; fish and hot sun don't exactly go well together." Miley stood up, then helped Lilly to her feet as well, and they walked away together hand in hand. Shaking his head in amusement, Robbie Ray walked over to the large tent where Heather Truscott was building a campfire.</p>
<p>"What was all that about?" she asked Robbie Ray with a smile.</p>
<p>"Two crazy teenage girls playing with a fish," he replied, holding up the offending creature. "I swear Heather, if they ever decide to have children together, we're all gonna be in big trouble!" Heather laughed.</p>
<p>"Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll put Miley and Lilly through the same things they put us through," she quipped.</p>
<p>"We can only hope, Heather," Robbie Ray chuckled. "We can only hope!"</p>
