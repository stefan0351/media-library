<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 33: The Boiling Point -->

<P>Seven reached the holodeck and saw that the Fairhaven program was in use, but
then noticed that there were security lockouts in effect. The Fairhaven program
was supposed to be open to all of the crew, so Seven felt justified when she
used her Borg algorithms to override the lockout. She walked into the program
and went to the bar, the most likely place to find Ensign Paris. She expected to
find him with the holographic bartender. She found him, and he was with a
hologram, but it was not the bartender.</P>
<P>Seven reached out and steadied herself on the oak table near the door. Her
Borg enhanced left hand crushed the wooden frame as she watched Tom Paris laying
on top of a hologram on the bar. The hologram was a well designed replica of
B’Elanna, and the holographic B’Elanna seemed to be enjoying the exchange.</P>
<P>"Tell me it’s me you want," Tom told the hologram as he kissed her neck.</P>
<P>"It’s you, Tom. It’s always been you," the holo-B’Elanna said. "I was just
killing time with that Borg."</P>
<P>"I knew it," Tom said smugly. "And that bastard child?" he asked. "Why?"</P>
<P>"It’s you I want, Tom. She wanted the kid, not me," the fake B’Elanna said as
she wrapped her legs around Tom’s waist.</P>
<P>Seven decided that any fence mending with Tom Paris was a waste of time. Her
time would be better spent constructing a casket for him, because she was going
to kill him.</P>
<P>"Deactivate Torres hologram," Seven ordered. Her voice was shaking almost as
much as her clenched fists were.</P>
<P>Tom’s body dropped to the bar, having lost his artificial B’Elanna body
pillow. "What the hell?" he asked as his face hit the oak bar.</P>
<P>Seven moved toward him in a slow, deliberate arch, taking note of the
possible tactical uses of every chair, glass, and table. Her face was contorted
with rage and indignation that he would copulate with a replica of her wife.</P>
<P>"You!" Tom yelled when he saw Seven coming toward him. "This is a private
program. What the hell are you doing here?" He jumped down and stood to his full
height. He felt his own rage growing as the woman who took B’Elanna from him now
took his holographic Lana as well. He wasn’t going to stand for it.</P>
<P>"A private program?" she asked. Her voice was now strangely calm as she
watched his anger rippling to the surface. Every species she had assimilated
gave her insight into humanoid behavior, and every one of those instincts told
her that this man was about to snap. "You dare replicate my wife? Dishonor her
by using her image as a concubine? You dare ask me what I am doing here?"</P>
<P>"Get out." Tom moved over to her and glared daggers at her. His jaw trembled
as he tried to clamp down his hatred.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said defiantly. She linked her hands behind her back and tilted
her head to the side.</P>
<P>"Fine by me," he responded. He leaned back and swung at her with his entire
weight behind his punch. </P>
<P>Seven saw the blow coming and shifted her jaw to one side an instant before
it hit. The minute adjustment took most of the force out of the hit, but he was
still able to connect with her face. She felt her lip split and her warm blood
trickled down her chin. She smiled.</P>
<P>Tom stared in disbelief. He had just hit Seven…a woman…a pregnant woman. He
had hit B’Elanna’s wife… B’Elanna’s pregnant wife. He was going to die. B’Elanna
would rip his heart out of his chest and devour it in front of him. Then he saw
the smile on Seven’s face, a dangerous and primal smile, more like a snarl.
B’Elanna wouldn’t get a chance to kill him. Seven would rip him in half before
B’Elanna ever knew what happened.</P>
<P>"Seven…" Tom began. He looked at the blood dripping off her chin staining the
pale purple blouse she was wearing.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said coolly as she stepped toward him.</P>
<P>"Huh?" he asked, backing away from the exBorg.</P>
<P>"I am now completely justified in whatever action I take," she explained. She
stalked him like the prey he had become, sliding chairs out of her way when he
would duck behind them seeking refuge.</P>
<P>"Uh, Seven… I didn’t mean to hit you… besides, what does it hurt if I have my
own Lana?" Even in the face of a predatory Borg he didn’t have enough sense to
stop claiming B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"She is not yours," Seven stated as she grabbed a chair with one hand and
tossed it completely across the bar. It landed almost five feet up the wall,
shattering on impact. "She is not even mine. She is her own. No one has the
right to replicate her for their depraved interests." She grabbed another chair
and tossed it in the opposite direction. This chair hit the window and crashed
through it.</P>
<P>"When I was with her, she <I>was</I> mine," Tom taunted. "She’s just staying
with you because of … that," he yelled, pointing at her belly. "She thought
she’d never get back to <I>Voyager</I>…to me… so she settled for you."</P>
<P>"That will no longer be an issue," Seven said calmly. "You will not be on
board <I>Voyager</I>."</P>
<P>"Oh really, where will I be?" he asked. </P>
<P>Becca, the holographic bartender, came wandering in, curious about the chair
that had come flying out of the tavern’s front window. Seven was momentarily
distracted.</P>
<P>Tom used the opportunity and shoved a chair at Seven and then moved along the
wall to escape. The chair slammed into Seven’s leg, causing her to spin back
toward him. Tom ducked behind Becca, using her as an impromptu bodyguard.</P>
<P>"Now, lassie, what is the problem?" Becca asked.</P>
<P>Seven reached up and snapped the hologram’s neck in almost the exact way
B’Elanna had weeks earlier. Her body dropped to the floor and Tom was now facing
Seven, with the wall at his back and nowhere to run. Then he made the worst
mistake of the already disastrous night, he swung at Seven again.</P>
<P>She caught his fist in her hand and squeezed. She squeezed as he dropped to
the floor screaming, she squeezed as she heard the bones in his hand shatter,
and she continued squeezing until she heard him whimper like a whipped dog. She
let his hand drop from hers and grabbed him by the collar of his shirt. He was
trying to hold his shattered hand and let out a whelp as she lifted him into the
air and pinned him to the wall.</P>
<P>"For as long as I can remember," Seven said in a whisper. "You have made
distasteful remarks about me… rude, sexually charged comments. Well, I am about
to make one of your wishes come true."</P>
<P>"What?" he asked. <I>‘I’m scared spitless, and now Seven is coming onto me?’
</I>he thought.</P>
<P>"When I came on board…you frequently commented when I entered a room that you
would, ‘<I>let her assimilate me any day,’</I>" Seven said. "Well, any day is
here." She reached up and held him in place with her right hand and eased back
her left hand. She held it up in front of him as the assimilation tubules
erupted from the back of her wrist and wriggled like tiny cobras looking for a
victim.</P>
<P>"You’re bluffing," he whispered, praying he was right.</P>
<P>"The Federation thought the Borg were bluffing at Wolf 359," Seven said as
she moved her hand toward his throat. "Borg do not bluff," she said as the
tubules danced across his skin.</P>
<P>"No," he whimpered. He vaguely felt a warmth spreading from the inside of his
leg moving down to his thigh. He wondered if that was what assimilation felt
like, then realized he had just lost control of his bladder.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The captain led Nara and Tach down the corridor toward the holodeck. The two
Narians had joined her for dinner. It gave her a much-needed break from the
daily grind of being Captain. After a light meal, Tach had asked to see the
holodeck, something he had heard B’Elanna explain in detail. He understood the
way it looked and the way it worked, but he was intrigued to see how holograms
could seem to have substance.</P>
<P>"You can’t be serious?" Kathryn asked Nara. The captain was laughing, trying
to retain some composure as she almost snorted. It was difficult considering
that she had heard a litany of stories about B’Elanna and Seven, many extremely
humorous and all giving her insight into the love her two officers shared.</P>
<P>"Oh, I’m serious," Nara said with an evil grin. "Every morning, B’Elanna
would make hot raspberry tea and bring it to Seven in bed. That woman is so
spoiled. I swear, Seven couldn’t wake up without it."</P>
<P>"Seven’s never had any trouble getting up early. Not ever," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>Nara looked at the captain skeptically then smiled in understanding. "That
was before she had her feisty wife keeping her up all night."</P>
<P>"Nara," Tach exclaimed. </P>
<P>"Oh, please," Nara said to him. "I know how much sleep we lost just living
next to them. I can’t even imagine how exhausting their late-night antics must
be. It’s a miracle they survived at all."</P>
<P>Janeway tried not to react, but she felt her cheeks warm as she blushed.</P>
<P>"You’re embarrassing the captain," Tach said.</P>
<P>"Not at all," Kathryn said diplomatically. "I’m just not used to thinking
about those two as a couple," she said honestly.</P>
<P>"Great goddess," Tach said. "I can’t imagine those to not together. I’ve
never seen a more fated bond."</P>
<P>"I’m beginning to see that," Janeway said as they neared the holodeck. "And I
assure you, they won’t be keeping you up on board <I>Voyager</I>. Our
soundproofing is state-of-the-art," she added with a wry grin. She didn’t add
that the crewmembers on each side of B’Elanna’s quarters had recently
requisitioned extra soundproofing.</P>
<P>The doors to the turbolift opened and Samantha and Naomi Wildman rushed out,
ready for an adventure with Flotter. The Captain’s Bridge Assistant smiled when
she saw Janeway and she looked at the newcomers with interest.</P>
<P>Samantha Wildman stood at attention, her instincts as an ensign overriding
the fact that she was off duty. "Ma’am," she said formally.</P>
<P>"At ease," Janeway said warmly. "You’re off duty."</P>
<P>Tach stared at the child and a huge grin covered his features. "Great goddess
above and below," he said with a laugh. "You must be Naomi Wildman."</P>
<P>"Yes," Naomi answered.</P>
<P>"By the goddess, I thought Seven was exaggerating," Nara said as she knelt in
front of the younger Wildman.</P>
<P>"Are you Seven and B’Elanna’s friends from the planet?" Naomi asked.</P>
<P>The Captain cleared her throat. "May I introduce Tach and Nara." She smiled
at the Narians. "This is indeed Naomi Wildman, my Bridge Assistant. I’m sure she
can answer any questions that you have about my ship." She glanced over at
Ensign Wildman who beamed proudly. "This is Ensign Samantha Wildman, a valued
member of my crew."</P>
<P>"A supreme pleasure to meet you," Tach said as he looked up at Samantha
Wildman. </P>
<P>"Yes," Nara added. "Tell me, little one, did Seven tell you about your
namesake?"</P>
<P>"Uh huh," Naomi responded. "Do I really look like a cow?" she asked,
scrunching her face up.</P>
<P>"No," Tach assured her. "It’s just that the cutest little calf had the same
color fur as your lovely hair." He reached out and smoothed her bangs out of her
eyes. "And it had the same adorable spikes."</P>
<P>"I wish I could have seen it," Naomi said quietly. "I’ve never met anyone
else with spikes."<BR></P>
<P>Nara looked at Janeway for an answer, but Samantha responded.</P>
<P>"Naomi’s father is in the Alpha Quadrant. She’s the only Katarian on board,"
Samantha said as she rubbed Naomi’s back.</P>
<P>"Well," Nara said as she stood. "I wish I were lucky enough to have spikes.
Maybe then Tach would listen to me," she added as she gave her spouse a gentle
head butt.</P>
<P>The doors to holodeck one opened and Harry Kim rushed out followed closely by
the Doctor. The dark haired Ensign almost knocked over his captain before he
could stop.</P>
<P>"What’s the hurry, Mister Kim?" Janeway asked with a bit of a smile. She
rested her hand on his shoulder and moved slightly back.</P>
<P>"Uh, Tom… Seven," he managed as he looked over at the door to holodeck
two.</P>
<P>"What?" Janeway demanded. She had been very clear when she had ordered Seven
to rest, and she had been equally clear that Paris was to stay away from
Seven.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Doctor said hurriedly. "Can we discuss this later? Right now
Ensign Paris is under the effects of his own misguided holo-programming and he
is with Seven."</P>
<P>"Let’s go," Janeway said as she stepped out of the way. She followed them to
the other holodeck with Nara and Tach in tow. Samantha kept Naomi in the
corridor, but waited to see what was happening.</P>
<P>The captain followed Harry and the Doctor into the Fairhaven program. She was
surprised by the feeling of dread the once familiar setting now caused within
her. She wondered how she could have ever spent time in this fantasy world when
she had a real life on board <I>Voyager</I>. Her musings were interrupted by a
terrified scream coming from the tavern.</P>
<P>They ran toward the sound and saw a broken chair on its side on top of the
shattered glass that used to be the tavern’s window. Janeway grabbed Harry’s arm
and pushed her way to the front of the caravan and she entered the bar
first.</P>
<P>She saw Seven holding Tom pressed against the wall with his feet swinging
underneath him.</P>
<P>Seven stared Tom in the eyes, then dropped him to the floor. He fell to his
knees and looked down at his legs, quickly confirming that he had indeed wet his
pants.</P>
<P>"Borg do not bluff," Seven repeated. "Be thankful that I am no longer Borg."
She let her hands drop to her sides and turned to leave, surprised to see Harry,
the Doctor, and most disturbing…the captain, standing in the doorway. Nara and
Tach joined the small group and stood behind them.</P>
<P>Janeway began to give Seven her most lethal force ten Janeway glare, but the
exdrone didn’t even flinch. Then captain noticed the blood on Seven chin and
blouse, and Janeway flinched. "What happened?" she asked, concern filling her
voice.</P>
<P>"Computer, activate Torres hologram," Seven said as she stopped in front of
Janeway. She raised her eyebrow and the Borg eyepiece that framed it.</P>
<P>Janeway watched as a holographic B’Elanna appeared and instantly ran to Tom,
who was curled into a ball on the floor. He hadn’t even looked up when the
captain and the others had entered.</P>
<P>"Tom, darling, what happened?" the holo-B’Elanna asked as she stroked his
back soothingly. She looked over at Seven and frowned. "I can’t believe I ever
put up with you, Borg. Tom is the only one I want."</P>
<P>Janeway bit her lip and let out a disgusted sigh. "Computer, end program,"
she ordered. The Fairhaven program disappeared, leaving the room black with
yellow grid lines. Tom remained huddled on the floor even as the Doctor rushed
over and began scanning him.</P>
<P>"What did you do to him?" Janeway asked. She was thankful that Paris was
still in relatively good condition. It was strictly against protocol and good
taste to use holograms based on crewmembers. Using Seven’s wife went beyond all
rational thought considering the amount of devotion she had displayed.</P>
<P>"More than you would have preferred," Seven told Janeway, "less than he
deserved."</P>
<P>"Did he do this?" Kathryn asked as she wiped the blood from Seven chin.</P>
<P>"He struck me. When he attempted to hit me again, I…stopped him." Seven
looked over at the Helmsman who had finally sat up. </P>
<P>"She tried to assimilate me," Tom said. He looked down at the puddle he was
sitting in and blushed.</P>
<P>"Had I attempted to assimilate you, you would already be a drone," Seven
pointed out.</P>
<P>"Doctor, how is he?" Harry asked as he moved closer to his friend.</P>
<P>"His brain chemistry is completely out of balance. I can’t believe you two
manipulated pheromones," the Doctor said as he shook his head.</P>
<P>"It wasn’t my idea," Harry whined.</P>
<P>"Mister Paris," the Doctor said as he yanked Tom to his feet. "Your hand is
broken. You should report directly to sickbay…" he paused and looked down at
Tom’s trousers, "Have the replicator in sickbay make you some pants." He gave
Tom a hypospray injection to ease the pain of his injury and then pushed him
toward the door.</P>
<P>"What’s wrong with him? Other than his hand?" Janeway asked as she moved over
to the Doctor. </P>
<P>"It’s a long story," the hologram stalled. He didn’t want to explain that she
had been slipped a hormonal mickey that had caused her to sleep with a hologram
and think that she was in love with it.</P>
<P>"We’re 35,000 light years from home…I think I have time to hear it," Janeway
replied.</P>
<P>Tach moved to Seven and placed his large, meaty hand on her shoulder, turning
her toward him. "How are you?" he asked as he inspected her split lip.</P>
<P>"I am… angry," Seven said carefully.</P>
<P>"Hey," Nara yelled at the Doctor. "She’s bleeding over here. Aren’t you
gonna’ do something?"</P>
<P>"Ah, yes," he said happily. "Duty calls," he told the captain and hurried
off.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tom Paris entered sickbay to find the Doctor waiting, and next to the
hologram was the captain. He had decided to change in his quarters, too
embarrassed to walk through the entire ship with soaked trousers. It was a
decision he was regretting. The painkiller the Doctor had given him had dulled
the pain, but when Tom had moved around to change clothes, it had aggravated the
injury. All he wanted now was to get the thing healed.</P>
<P>"Uh… ma’am," he said quietly. He suddenly wondered if changing his pants was
such a good idea because the look the captain was giving him almost made him
soil the clean pair he was wearing.</P>
<P>"Get over here, Mister Paris," the Doctor said as he pointed to the biobed.
"We need to fix that hand of yours."</P>
<P>"It hurts like hell, Doc." Tom carefully jumped onto the biobed. "Why didn’t
you mend it in the holodeck?"</P>
<P>"Given the volatile nature of the company, I thought getting you out of the
holodeck as quickly as possible seemed prudent," the Doctor explained. "I
expected you to report directly here. You are a medical assistant. I thought you
could administer your own analgesics." He scanned Tom’s hand and then moved the
medical tricorder up to scan his head. "Well, your brain chemistry has
stabilized. Now we just have to get it back to normal."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Tom asked.</P>
<P>"Your Fairhaven program," Janeway said as she moved closer. Her voice was
like dry ice, just as cold and just as likely to burn. "Your little addition of
pheromones seems to have created all kinds of problems… your hitting Seven is
just the latest symptom. If the Doctor hadn’t explained to me that you are not
acting under your own free will, you’d be in the brig right now."</P>
<P>"I can’t believe I did that," Tom said quietly. "Hey?" He looked up at the
Doctor. "What do you mean I’m not acting under my own free will?"</P>
<P>"The pheromones you exposed yourself to…and the rest of the crew… are
dangerous. They stimulated your own…baser reactions," the Doctor told him.
"Let’s just hope Lieutenant Torres thinks you should be shown leniency."</P>
<P>"How’s Seven?" Tom asked. He looked down at his feet while the Doctor mended
his broken hand.</P>
<P>"Fine," the Doctor said cheerfully. "Better than you. She broke almost every
bone in your hand."</P>
<P>"You should leave it," Tom said, disgusted by his own behavior. "I can’t
believe she didn’t kill me."</P>
<P>Janeway moved to the table and cleared her throat. "That’s not in her nature.
Even after you attacked her…" The captain winced as she remembered the swollen
and bloody wound on Seven’s lip. "She wouldn’t kill you." Janeway smiled, trying
to lighten the moment. "Now, if you had hit B’Elanna… I don’t think any amount
of security could have kept Seven from tossing you out an airlock."</P>
<P>"I’d never hit Lana," Tom said angrily, then realized that he wouldn’t have
expected himself to hit Seven. "But I see your point."</P>
<P>"There you are," the Doctor said with a smug smile. "Good as new. Now, all I
have to do is get your brain chemistry back in order."</P>
<P>"Oh, I can’t believe this," Tom groaned as he tested his freshly healed hand.
"Was anyone else effected?"</P>
<P>"Apparently, yes," Janeway said with disgust.</P>
<P>"Who?" Tom asked, then he realized the captain wasn’t hanging out in sickbay
to comfort him. "Oh, Captain…I’m sorry…Sullivan…"</P>
<P>"Until further notice, Mister Paris, you are restricted from any access to
the holodeck controls," Janeway said. "I need to have an engineering team go
through every program and make sure there’s no bleed-through into any other
characters."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am." Tom sighed. "I’m just glad you didn’t have any of the problems
I did. At least the Sullivan program didn’t screw up your life."</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said as she went back to her own biobed. She almost laughed
out loud. Hadn’t screwed up her life? She made a fool of herself by swooning
over a hologram and that foolish behavior drove Seven out of her life forever.
True, she was happy for B’Elanna and Seven, but she couldn’t stop wondering…what
if?</P>
<P>"If I hadn’t messed up with this program," Tom said as he picked at the
blanket under him, "I’d still be with B’Elanna." </P>
<P>"And she wouldn’t be happy," Janeway said with complete conviction. "I know
that you don’t want to hear this, Tom…" <I>‘Hell, I don’t want to hear it
either,’</I> she thought. "But B’Elanna and Seven are happy. Not only happy,
they’re right for each other. You and B’Elanna were always bickering over
something. If it hadn’t been your holographic…transgression…it would have been
something else."</P>
<P>"Yeah, well…" the comment died on Tom’s lips as realized that he may still
have a chance. If he went to B’Elanna and explained that he wasn’t in control
when he slept with Becca… B’Elanna would be honor bound to forgive him. And if
it hadn’t been for that…they would still be together. He could challenge her
marriage to Seven. </P>
<P>"I don’t like that look in your eyes," Janeway said dangerously. "I don’t
want you having any contact with B’Elanna or Seven until the Doctor says you are
completely back to normal."</P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am," he said happily. He could wait… after all, B’Elanna wasn’t
going anywhere. He glanced over at Janeway, wondering how she could tell with
one look what he was thinking. ‘<I>She must be part Betazoid,</I>’ he finally
decided.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven stood outside the door to her quarters. She had just walked Tach and
Nara to their guest accommodations. Naomi Wildman had assisted her, telling the
visitors all about <I>Voyager’s </I>systems as they had walked to the VIP
quarters. Afterwards, Seven had walked home alone, thinking about the pheromonal
interface. Tom Paris wasn’t responsible for his actions, at least not
completely. The Doctor compared his condition to being under the influence of a
strong mind altering drug that brought out all of his more animalistic actions.
She wondered what B’Elanna would say. Would she forgive him? Would she be forced
to reconsider breaking up with him? She knew B’Elanna loved her completely but
she wondered if her wife would feel bound by honor to reconcile with Paris. She
took a deep breath and then went to face her fate.</P>
<P>B’Elanna was leaning across the kitchenette counter trying to reach a candle
from behind a stack of data padds. She stood and turned, smiling at her wife.
"Welcome home, my darling."</P>
<P>Seven stared, her jaw dropping. No matter how may times she saw B’Elanna,
each time she was amazed by her beauty. B’Elanna was wearing a floor length,
blood red nightgown. It had thin straps that tended to slip off of her shoulders
and it clung to the sensual curves of her nubile form, making Seven forget what
she had been thinking about.</P>
<P>"Cat got your tongue?" B’Elanna asked as she moved closer. She had the lights
down low to make it easier for Ty to sleep and to add to the mood. Ty was in his
sleeper, content, and not going to wake anytime soon. </P>
<P>"You… are…" Seven blushed and looked down at the carpeting. "I do not have
words to describe your beauty."</P>
<P>"Why don’t you come to bed and show me?" B’Elanna suggested. She let her hand
trail across Seven’s neck, lingering on her spine and then moving down her arm
and taking Seven by the hand. "Come with me, Be’nal."</P>
<P>Seven followed, still looking at the carpet. They reached the bed and
B’Elanna lifted Seven’s chin and leaned in to kiss her. Her Klingon nostrils
flared as she took in the scent of fresh blood. </P>
<P>"What is it?" Seven asked as she leaned down to capture her wife’s full
lips.</P>
<P>"Where were you?" B’Elanna asked. She rubbed both of Seven’s arms as she
looked at the exdrone’s face for any sign of injury.</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and sighed deeply.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes moved down to Seven’s blouse and she noticed a discolored
area. She recognized it as a bloodstain that had been washed out. "What
happened? Are you all right?" She touched Seven’s face, inspecting her more
intensely.</P>
<P>"I am fine," Seven said. She opened her eyes and smiled weakly. "I went to
‘make things right’ with Ensign Paris. It did not go well."</P>
<P>"Did he hurt you?" B’Elanna’s eyes widened. "Pa’Tach! I’ll kill him."</P>
<P>"No, love," Seven said as she held B’Elanna close to her. She could feel the
Klingon’s pulse increasing under her fingers so she slowly caressed her exposed
skin to soothe her. "I am fine. He is not…responsible for what happened."</P>
<P>B’Elanna studied Seven’s expression. Her wife was deeply upset, the stress
lines around her eyes proving that she was frightened as well. "Seven, did you…
did you hurt him? Is that his blood?" She pointed to the watermark on Seven’s
blouse, intentionally not asking if her wife had killed him. She knew Seven had
a temper, but she would never kill a fellow crewmember.</P>
<P>"I cannot fool you. Your Klingon sense of smell is fine-tuned for blood,"
Seven stalled.</P>
<P>"Tell me," B’Elanna pleaded. She was getting worried.</P>
<P>"The holodeck program…Fairhaven… when Ensign Paris created it, he added
synthetic pheromones to the matrix," Seven explained. She wanted to make sure
that her wife knew Paris hadn’t been in control before she mentioned being
hit.</P>
<P>"What an ass," B’Elanna said as she shook her head. "Won’t he ever grow
up?"</P>
<P>"An ass indeed," Seven said. "The pheromones have been making him act
irrationally, possessive, and… aggressive."</P>
<P>"Does the Doctor know?" B’Elanna asked. She was concerned, Tom was an
immature idiot, but she didn’t want him to see him ill.</P>
<P>"Yes, he is treating the imbalance as we speak." Seven eased past B’Elanna
and took her own Nightgown off of the bed. B’Elanna had carefully arranged a
sapphire blue gown on the bed for the exdrone. "As well as…other injuries."</P>
<P>"Seven, you’re scaring me. Please tell me what happened." B’Elanna gently
massaged Seven’s shoulders and kissed her neck. She moved the thick blonde braid
aside and let her lips linger beneath Seven’s ear. </P>
<P>"I injured him," Seven whispered. "I did not know he was under the pheromonal
effects."</P>
<P>"What happened?" B’Elanna gently prompted as she turned Seven around.</P>
<P>"He… had a hologram… of you, and then he… he struck me." Seven bit her
lip.</P>
<P>"I don’t care what his excuse is…I’m going to tear his heart out," B’Elanna
said. Her eyes flashed and her body straightened and every muscle twitched with
rage. "Where did he hit you? Are you sure you’re okay?"</P>
<P>Seven nodded. "He split my lip…but my retaliation was…extreme."</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt her heart skip a beat. The thought of Seven being injured made
her stomach clench. </P>
<P>"Oh, Be’nal," she whispered as she touched Seven’s lip with her fingers. Her
touch was impossibly gentle, testing the sensual flesh for any injury. She
leaned forward and kissed her wife’s lips. "Tell me," she whispered. She could
feel the tension in Seven’s body without even touching her. When she connected
with her lips, she knew that Seven was struggling to hold herself together. "I’m
here," B’Elanna promised as she gathered her wife into her arms.</P>
<P>"I broke his hand," Seven whispered. "Lana, I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to
hurt him so much." She took in a shaking breath. "I wanted to make him pay for
the hologram, for trying to break us up, and most of all … for hurting you."</P>
<P>"I’m guessing this hologram was not just playing Kadis-Kot with him?"
B’Elanna kissed Seven’s temple.</P>
<P>"Not any variation of Kadis-kot that I have seen." Seven laughed.</P>
<P>"I would have broken more than his hand," B’Elanna admitted. She ran her hand
down Seven’s back, caressing the tense muscles she found. "I can’t believe he
did that. I want to see the Doctor’s proof that he wasn’t responsible for these
things… otherwise he has an appointment with my bat’tleth."</P>
<P>"I already spoke with the Doctor… while he healed my lip." Seven eased back
so that she could look into B’Elanna’s eyes. "It was not his fault. I injured a
man who was innocent."</P>
<P>"Not innocent," B’Elanna corrected. "He did all those things. And no matter
what the Doctor says…I will not forgive him for hitting you."</P>
<P>"You must. Honor demands it." Seven’s lip trembled.</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" B’Elanna asked. She was more concerned with the
brokenhearted look on her wife’s face than the question of honor.</P>
<P>"He was not in his right mind. You must forgive him…just as you must forgive
him for…sleeping with the hologram before we left," Seven said. She was amazed
that she had been able to say the words without her heart stopping inside her
chest. "And if you forgive that… there would be no reason to break up with him."
Seven turned away, unable to look at her wife’s face.</P>
<P>"Come back here," B’Elanna whispered. She turned Seven back to her and
pressed their foreheads together. "First of all, I would gladly give up my honor
before I would give up what we have." B’Elanna pulled back and lightly stroked
Seven’s cheek with the back of her fingers. "Second, Klingon honor wouldn’t have
me leave my Be’nal…the love of my life, to go back to a bumbling idiot. If I
were still single, I would have the option of taking him back, but only if I
still wanted him. The Klingons don’t have much respect for people who can’t
control their own actions," B’Elanna explained. She leaned forward and rubbed
her nose across Seven’s. "So you can’t quit worrying, I can see it was bothering
you."</P>
<P>Seven smiled shyly. "You know me so well, my wife," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>"Was anyone else effected?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Just the captain, but she is being treated," Seven said. "Which explains why
she ‘fell in love’ with a hologram."</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said. She suddenly felt her own irrational fears raise their
heads. "So…she didn’t really want to…"</P>
<P>"Shhh…" Seven took B’Elanna’s face in both hands and locked eyes with her.
Lapis blue met sable brown, both sets of eyes overflowing with devotion. "I am
with the woman I love. No one could ever make we want to stray." Seven leaned
over and kissed each of her wife’s cheeks and then she gave her a chaste kiss on
the lips. "You are more than I could ever need, all that I have dreamed of, and
I will spend my life trying to be worthy."</P>
<P>"You complete me," B’Elanna said as her hand came up play with Seven’s thick
braid. "I didn’t know I could love anyone as deeply as I love you. I am
yours."</P>
<P>"Ironic," Seven said with a smile. "I told Mister Paris that I did not own
you, that you belonged only to yourself."</P>
<P>"Well, you were wrong," B’Elanna said with a mock growl. She leaned forward
and caught Seven’s lip gently between her teeth and quickly flicked her tongue
over the captured lip before letting go. "You own me body and soul. I was always
afraid to give myself over to anyone before, but with you… I don’t feel lessened
by it. I like knowing that I belong to you and you to me. I feel like we’re
still individuals, but together we are so much stronger."</P>
<P>"So we are a collective?" Seven whispered as she covered B’Elanna’s mouth
with her own. They kissed slowly, reverently as if the earlier tension needed to
be carefully washed away. B’Elanna was the first to escalate the kiss, letting
her tongue ease out and request entry to Seven’s mouth. Her tongue lathed across
Seven’s lips and teeth seeking entrance. The exdrone’s mouth opened granting
access and both women moaned as their tongues met.</P>
<P>After a few minutes of exploration, B’Elanna puled back, steadying herself
against Seven’s chest. "I like this collective," she said with a leer. "But I
think I need more…input… to be certain."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven smiled and pulled B’Elanna back to her. "Then I shall do my
best to give you that input," Seven responded with a leer of her own. "I do not
want your research to be incomplete."</P>
<P>"What about Ty?" B’Elanna asked as she began unbuttoning Seven’s blouse. </P>
<P>"Let him do his own research," Seven said impatiently. She reached up and
tugged her blouse over her head, sending one of the buttons flying off across
the room.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. "No, love…I mean he’s in the next room," she said as she
ran her hands over Seven’s bra. She was loved the way Seven’s nipples jumped to
attention when she touched them. Even through the fabric of her bra, the pink
skin puckered instantly.</P>
<P>"Uuh," Seven moaned and tossed her head back, pressing her chest into
B’Elanna’s hands. "We made love many times with him in the next room at the
cabin," Seven said as she slowly lifted her head back up. Her eyes had darkened
to the color of the sky on Jusari Prime just before dawn, when the sky was black
shading to blue as the light broke over the horizon. "You will just have to…be
quiet."</P>
<P>"Quiet?" B’Elanna asked incredulously as she dove forward and nipped Seven’s
throat. "I’m out of practice being quiet." She kissed along Seven’s neck, up to
her ear and began nibbling the tender lobe she found there.</P>
<P>Seven whimpered as she felt B’Elanna’s tongue circling her earlobe. It was
the exact motion Lana used on a much lower part of Seven’s anatomy. She let her
hands move down to the silk of B’Elanna’s nightgown, loving the contrast of the
cool fabric over B’Elanna’s heated flesh. Klingons had a higher temperature than
humans, something that Seven had found many enjoyable uses for. She loved the
way B’Elanna felt pressed against her in the night, the way a single touch would
fill her with heat, and especially how B’Elanna’s mouth felt when pressed to her
most intimate flesh.</P>
<P>"Close the door," Seven said with growl. "I want your mouth elsewhere."</P>
<P>"Yes, my love," B’Elanna said with a giggle. She trotted to the door, pausing
to take a peak across the living room to where Ty was sound asleep, then closed
the door. "Now what?" B’Elanna asked innocently as she turned back around. "Oh,
sweet Kahless," B’Elanna said when she saw her wife. She had to lean against the
wall, having gone literary weak in the knees.</P>
<P>Seven had managed to rip off her clothes and put on the deep blue nightgown
in the few seconds it had taken B’Elanna to check on Ty. She was stretched
across the fur blanket on her back, with her hands linked behind her head and
had a decidedly devious smirk on her lips. </P>
<P>"You think I resemble an overweight Klingon in need of a tooth sharpening?"
Seven asked as she sat up and arched her back. </P>
<P>B’Elanna shook her head as she watched Seven lick her lips, wetting every
centimeter of the tender skin. </P>
<P>"Let me make love to you, Be’nal," Seven whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna could only nod as she sprinted to the bed.</P>
