<!-- Coming To An Agreement \ Part 3 -->

<p>Seven heard the hiss of the sickbay doors open and almost immediately the voice of the captain.</p>
<p>&#034;What happened?&#034; Janeway asked abruptly.</p>
<p>That tone had caused lesser people to cower in unmitigated fear. One of her crew had been injured and the small, albeit formidable captain had her hackles up.</p>
<p>&#034;We were attacked by the Zeist.&#034; Seven said simply.</p>
<p>Slowly, she turned away from the sight of the doctor operating on B'Elanna and faced her captain.</p>
<p>What Kathryn saw made her blood freeze.</p>
<p>Seven was extremely pale, even for her. Her eyes looked dazed and Kathryn noticed her hands were trembling slightly.</p>
<p>&#034;Are you alright?&#034; Concern softened her voice.</p>
<p>She grasped Seven's human hand and led her to the chair in the doctor's office.</p>
<p>She had never seen the self-assured young woman so distraught. There was more here than an unprovoked attack.</p>
<p>Janeway squatted down on one knee in front of Seven so she could look into her eyes, still holding her hand. </p>
<p>&#034;You want to talk about it?&#034; she prompted gently.</p>
<p>&#034;IIdo not know what to say.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;It's alright, I'm here.&#034; Kathryn said, rubbing the pale hand. &#034;Just start at the beginning and go slow. I need to know what happened.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;We were in a bar.&#034; Seven began hesitantly.</p>
<p>Big surprise, thought Kathryn, keeping her mouth shut.</p>
<p>Seven seemed unable to focus on Janeway's face. Her eyes drifted everywhere but on the smaller woman knelt in front of her.</p>
<p>&#034;The lieutenant had been drinking heavily when three Zeist entered. It was apparent they were looking for us.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Why 'apparent'?&#034; Janeway asked in a puzzled tone.</p>
<p>&#034;They were not drinking. They sat and looked only at us.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Go on.&#034; She prompted.</p>
<p>&#034;I suggested it was time to return to Voyager. We left the establishment, and the Zeist followed. We were trapped in a heavily shielded cargo bay when the Zeist opened fire with disrupter type weapons.&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway made an effort to control the shudder she felt when Seven looked into her eyes. It had been a long time since she had seen such a desolate look. Kathryn could see the obvious pain, but there was something elseguilt?</p>
<p>&#034;Lieutenant Torres was shot. It was my fault. I was unfamiliar with the layout of the station.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Now you listen to me.&#034; Janeway ordered. &#034;It was not your fault. If it hadn't been for you, lieutenant Torres would be dead.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;She may still die.&#034; Seven said looking away.</p>
<p>&#034;It wasn't your fault.&#034; the captain insisted in a husky tone. &#034;It was the fault of the people who attacked you.&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway suddenly noticed the blood on the front of the blue bio-suit. She knew of the Borg's efficiency and suddenly wondered at something else.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven,&#034; she hesitated trying to decide how to frame the question. &#034;What happened to the Zeist.&#034;</p>
<p>The blond raised her head with a snap, reading the real question in the captain's eyes.</p>
<p>&#034;I did not kill them. I stunned them. But I would gladly have done so. The only reason I did not, is because I knew it would displease you.&#034;</p>
<p>She looked down before continuing, &#034;This is lieutenant Torres' blood.&#034;</p>
<p>Janeway paled as she realized the amount of blood loss the woman must have endured. Her eyes became granite. If they hurried they might be able to have the administrator detain the aliens.</p>
<p>Janeway tapped her communicator and asked Tuvok to contact the administrator immediately. She gave the basic information he would need to emphasize the importance of the detention.</p>
<p>She turned her attention back to the woman still sitting forlornly before her.</p>
<p>&#034;It may be sometime before she comes out of surgery. Why don't you go change, maybe eat something and try to regenerate for a while.&#034; Kathryn suggested gently.</p>
<p>&#034;I will not leave until I know the lieutenant will recover.&#034; Seven said in a voice that would freeze molten lava.</p>
<p>One of the traits of a good Starfleet captain was to know when you were defeated. Kathryn's lips curled in a small smile as she realized the real meaning of 'futile' would be trying to get Seven to leave.</p>
<p>Kathryn wondered suddenly if Seven's path to Humanity had carried her far enough to develop romantic feelings for the half-Klingon. Was it possible that some of the antagonism between the two actually stemmed from suppressed emotions? She was surprised at the sharp stab of jealousy she felt in the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>Kathryn had always harbored a secret desire to establish a more intimate connection to the incredible ex-drone, but she had held back not wanting to push the young woman into something she wasn't ready for. Now, Kathryn had the distinct impression that she had waited too long and forever lost her chance.</p>
<p>Slowly she inhaled, controlling the hurt and allowing her compassion to take over. If this was what was happening, she intended to support Seven in any way possible. The younger woman's happiness meant more to Kathryn than her own pain.</p>
<p>She only prayed Seven would not be hurt. There was the Klingon's relationship with Tom to consider, or worse yet what if B'Elanna didn't return the Borg's feelings? Still, she knew this was something that would have to play itself out without her influence.</p>
<p>&#034;Alright.&#034; She relented, fighting the sting of tears, &#034;but as soon as she's resting, you will take care of yourself.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven was surprised Janeway had given up so easily, but was extremely grateful. She didn't think she had the ability to walk out without knowing the half-Klingon would survive.</p>
<p>&#034;Thank you, captain.&#034; She said sincerely.</p>
<p>Janeway spared a parting glance to the containment area where the doctor was still operating. Then she headed for the bridge, intent on seeking justice for her crewmembers.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>Seven was working at her console in Astrometrics. Her thoughts were constantly interrupted by memories of recent events.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had been in surgery for a little over three hours. The doctor finished and announced in his usual blustering way that the lieutenant would live thanks to him, and said it would be several hours before lieutenant Torres would regain consciousness.</p>
<p>&#034;May I see her.&#034; She asked.</p>
<p>&#034;WellI suppose. But only for a moment.&#034; He admonished as he walked toward his office.</p>
<p>Seven had walked over to the bio-bed, looking down on the feisty woman. She was amazed at how much she had come to care for B'Elanna in such a short period of time. </p>
<p>She looks so small, Seven thought. </p>
<p>The brown eyes were closed, and the respiration came in small even breaths. Seven lifted her right hand and brushed her fingertips across the brow ridges. She had been fascinated with them since acknowledging the attraction she felt for the young woman. </p>
<p>Seven resisted the urge to press her lips where her fingers had been, knowing the doctor was probably watching through the transparent wall of his office.</p>
<p>Her fingertips continued to explore the skin beneath her, knowing it was something the engineer probably wouldn't allow had she been conscious.</p>
<p>&#034;I love you, B'Elanna.&#034; She whispered softly. </p>
<p>Seven had left sickbay then, intending to carry out her promise to the captain. After changing and consuming a small amount of nutritional supplements, she had regenerated for two hours.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When the regeneration cycle completed, Seven opened her eyes to see the captain standing beside her. She thought she saw a fleeting look of pain before the command mask slipped into place.</p>
<p>In a voice heavy with disappointment, Janeway informed her the Zeist had already recovered and vacated before the administrator's security detail could locate them.</p>
<p>Voyager was cleared for immediate departure and had now resumed course for the Alpha Quadrant. There was nothing she could do.</p>
<p>Seven forced her thoughts back to the present. It had been 6.2 hours since she left sickbay and she suddenly felt the need to see lieutenant Torres.</p>
<p>As Seven shutdown her workstation, she realized how illogical she was being. The doctor had told her he would inform her of any changes in his patient's condition, but she felt the overwhelming urge to see for herself.</p>
<p>Seven strode briskly, her hips swaying sensuously, for the turbolift. She took the lift to deck five, and walked down the corridor to sickbay.</p>
<p>A quick scan of the room showed B'Elanna's bed had been moved to a remote far corner to afford the woman some semblance of privacy.</p>
<p>Someone had gotten to sickbay before her, and Seven identified the visitor leaning over the engineer as Tom Paris.</p>
<p>His back was to the entrance, effectively blocking the Borg's view of B'Elanna. Tom was bent over slightly and Seven could tell he was holding B'Elanna's right hand with both of his.</p>
<p>The lovers were speaking in such low tones Seven, even with her Borg enhanced hearing, could not tell what they were saying.</p>
<p>Seven felt a sudden crushing intensity within her chest. She was finding it difficult to breathe and tears stung the backs of her eyes. She wanted to throttle him!</p>
<p>As quickly as the anger took possession of her, it fled, to be replaced with jealousy.</p>
<p>I want it to be me, she thought. I want her to speak to me in such a manner. But she loves him, not me. </p>
<p>Tom bent forward and pressed a lingering kiss to B'Elanna's lips.</p>
<p>Seven gasped at the fresh onslaught of pain and whirled on her heel, leaving sickbay. </p>
<p>How could I ever think she would care for me? I am Borg.</p>
<p>There is no one for me here on Voyager, she told herself. I am alone. I have been alone since I was severed from the Collective.</p>
<p>Feelings are irrelevant. B'Elanna is in love with someone else. The most she could feel for me would be sympathy. I do not want her sympathy I want her love. The love that she is incapable of giving.</p>
<p>Shoulders slumped; Seven went to cargo bay 2. She went where the Borg alcove was. It was the only thing familiar in a suddenly hostile environment.</p>
<p>The heartbroken woman sat on the dais, taking harsh gasping breaths. She would not let the tears fall. She refused. Then, they were streaming down her face in an unstoppable flood. She leaned against the railing, muffling her sobs. </p>
<p>Eventually, the tears slowed. Seven carefully wiped at her face with her hands, before standing shakily. She set the regeneration cycle to wake her at 0600 hours.</p>
<p>She was Borg. She would continue to function. She would have no more interest in non-productive social activities. She would not pursue Humanity. Such things caused only pain.</p>
<p>Seven stepped into the alcove and closed her eyes as the regeneration cycle engaged.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=100>

<p>B'Elanna awoke with a start. She looked around carefully, recognizing the familiar walls of sickbay. </p>
<p>She started to sit up and found she couldn't move. She felt pain in every fiber of her being.</p>
<p>&#034;Doctor?&#034; she asked loudly, hoping the hologram would hear.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm here, lieutenant.&#034; he said, walking up next to the bio-bed. &#034;You can't move because you have a regenerative pack attached to your midsection.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;What the hell happened? Did you get the number of the shuttle that hit me?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Very droll, lieutenant.&#034;</p>
<p>The E.M.H. told B'Elanna how she had been struck by the disrupter fire and rescued by Seven.</p>
<p>&#034;You would have died had my skill not been so extraordinary. You will still need several days in sickbay to recover.&#034; he concluded.</p>
<p>&#034;That's just great. I feel like I'm on display.&#034;</p>
<p>The doctor took a deep breath, which was completely unnecessary for a hologram, as he considered the situation.</p>
<p>An unhappy Klingon would not ensure the smooth operation of the medical facility, far from it. </p>
<p>&#034;We could move the bio-bed to the far corner. It would afford you some privacy. That's the best I can do, I'm afraid. I need to monitor your progress. And stop complaining. It's the least you can do after bleeding all over my sickbay.&#034;</p>
<p>That's some bedside manner, Torres thought. Still, it was more than she had hoped for. She agreed reluctantly, and was forced to remain still as the doctor pushed the bed across the room.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven was quite concerned about you.&#034; he informed her cheerfully while moving the bed. &#034;She was covered in your blood, but wouldn't leave until she knew you would recover; even after the captain ordered her to.&#034;</p>
<p>He didn't notice the look of shock on the lieutenant's face as her continued his monologue.</p>
<p>&#034;From what I understand, she actually put her own life in danger to save you. That's not what I would consider very efficient for a Borg. I didn't know you two had become such good friends.&#034;</p>
<p>The doctor finished moving the bed and finally seemed to notice how quiet his patient was.</p>
<p>&#034;Lieutenant? Are you alright?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Uhfine, doctor. I guess I'm just tired.&#034; She lied.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, well, you should get some rest. You'll probably have visitors soon.&#034;</p>
<p>The holodoctor made sure B'Elanna was comfortable before retiring to his office.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's thoughts were centered on a certain blond. </p>
<p>She remembered the bar, and the beginning of the shoot-out. She had heard shouts and turned around, for some stupid reason. She remembered trying to maintain consciousness. After that, her memory became fuzzy. All she had was a few disjointed images. </p>
<p>The engineer had a vague memory of Seven lifting her out of the aisle and ducking behind some cargo. She definitely remembered the feel of the Borg's soft breasts against her back. She must have lost consciousness then because she didn't remember anything else. Well, almost nothing else. She remembered Seven saying her name, 'B'Elanna'.</p>
<p>Seven had never called her by her name before. She had always called her lieutenant, sometimes accompanying that with her last name, but never 'B'Elanna'.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was her imagination, but she also remembered a wealth of emotion in Seven's voice when she had said the name.</p>
<p>Then, apparently, the young woman had insisted on staying with her, defying the captain's orders until she knew B'Elanna would survive. B'Elanna's lips quirked with that thought. Seven was always defying the captain.</p>
<p>I noticed the doctor didn't say anything about Paris. Where was he during all of this, she wondered feeling abandoned.</p>
<p>The doors to sickbay hissed open, drawing her attention. She glanced over, surprising herself by hoping it would be Seven of Nine. She was equally surprised to discover her disappointment when she identified the visitor as Tom Paris. Speak of the devil</p>
<p>&#034;Hey,&#034; he said softly. </p>
<p>Tom leaned against the edge of the bed and took B'Elanna's right hand into both of his.</p>
<p>&#034;You gave us quite a scare. How are you feeling?&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked into his eyes, searching for the spark of excitement she used to feel. When had the thrill fizzled out?</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Whatoh, sorry. Just thinking. I'm okay. I hear I have Seven of Nine to thank.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Yeah, evidently the station has monitoring devices in the cargo areas, in case of theft. Unfortunately, their security doesn't view those video outputs unless an incident actually occurs. The captain was able to obtain the digital chip from the Administrator.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You mean it actually recorded the attack?&#034; </p>
<p>That was great, they would be able to prosecute the scoundrels! B'Elanna felt a growl rise in her throat.</p>
<p>&#034;Hold on a minute.&#034; He said, sensing her growing excitement. &#034;By the time the Administrator sent a security detail to the cargo area, they were gone.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Damn. It figures. Why can't we get a break, just once?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You did.&#034; Tom insisted softly. &#034;You're alive. The captain reviewed the file and Seven is probably due for a commendation.&#034;</p>
<p>He leaned closer to Torres, and she was suddenly aware that he was going to kiss her. She was dismayed to realize she didn't really want him to. Tom pressed his lips to B'Elanna's. She hesitated, not wanting to hurt his feelings by pushing him away.</p>
<p>The doors to sickbay opened and someone entered the room. Seven observed the scene and left quickly, completely unnoticed by the lovers.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pushed gently against Paris' chest.</p>
<p>&#034;Tom.&#034; She said quietly. &#034;I really think I need some rest.&#034;</p>
<p>A frown crossed his face fleetingly. &#034;Uh, sure. But, I'll be back to see you later.&#034; He promised. &#034;I'll bring you some dinner.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Sure.&#034; She smiled.</p>
<p>B'Elanna heaved an unaccountable sigh of relief when he finally left. </p>
<p>What am I going to do?</p>
<p>She had been released to her quarters after three days spent recovering in sickbay. B'Elanna was feeling pulled in two separate directions and couldn't seem to find any resolution to her dilemma. </p>
<p>On one hand she was missing the blond woman that had saved her life. Seven hadn't been by once to see her, and it was driving the engineer crazy. Had she said something to Seven after being injured that had made the woman uncomfortable?</p>
<p>Of course that would be nothing new, B'Elanna readily admitted to herself. Verbal sparing was a normal part of their everyday interaction. Still, she had thought they were starting to get along better and was disappointed to realize she seemed to be the only one who felt that way.</p>
<p>Then there was Tom. For some reason she was having trouble forcing herself to spend time with him. When he wasn't around, she missed him. But when he was, he irritated her. She loved him, but it was different. Somehow not as encompassing as it used to be. More like a strong friendship. There just wasn't any fire, and she craved fire!</p>
<p>Logically, she thought, I should call things off. But honor demanded that she stay with him. After all, he hadn't done anything wrong. His juvenile antics aside, he had stood by her through everything.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous, B'Elanna thought disgustedly.</p>
<p>She looked up with a snarl when the chime to her quarters interrupted her musings.</p>
<p>The Klingon invited in her visitor without moving from her comfortable position sprawled out on the couch.</p>
<p>The doors slid open to reveal Lieutenant Paris with a smooth green bottle in his hands.</p>
<p>&#034;Hey,&#034; he said by way of greeting. &#034;I thought we could celebrate you being out of sickbay with a nice bottle of Chateau Picard.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Uh, I'm not really in the mood, Tom. But thanks anyway.&#034;</p>
<p>The fair-haired helmsman stopped walking toward her and frowned mightily. </p>
<p>&#034;You haven't been in the mood for much of anything lately.&#034; he observed.</p>
<p>&#034;Want to talk about it?&#034;</p>
<p>He sat the bottle on the coffee table and settled down beside B'Elanna on the sofa. While he waited patiently for her reply, he gently picked up her hand.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was vaguely aware that she didn't want any physical contact with him. She gently disentangled her hand and scooted a little further away.</p>
<p>&#034;Okay.&#034; he said, taking a deep breath. &#034;Want to explain that? B'Elanna, I know you went through a lot on the station, but please don't pull away from me.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt a brief stab of remorse at the hurt look on his face, but her honor wouldn't allow her to dissemble or flat out lie to him.</p>
<p>&#034;Look, Tomsomething did happen. Or at least I think it did. But, I really don't want to talk about it, right now. I need to work through some things.&#034;</p>
<p>Hesitantly, he searched her eyes. &#034;This isn't about the attack is it?&#034; he said suddenly.</p>
<p>&#034;B'Elanna, is this because I wanted an open relationship? You know I only wanted that so we could explore other possibilities. I didn't want to crowd you.&#034; he finished desperately reaching for her hand again.</p>
<p>B'Elanna kept her hands firmly in her lap. Yeah, she knew why he wanted an open relationship. Because that way he could chase every woman on the ship, while she sat in her quarters. It just wasn't in her to see more than one person at a time.</p>
<p>Maybe that had been the beginning of it. Maybe she had known then it would never work.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm sorry, Tom.&#034; B'Elanna said in a soft tone. &#034;Maybe it's for the best if we take a break from each other for a little while.&#034;</p>
<p>There was no response for a moment, and she could practically see the wheels spinning in his head. He was searching for a way to convince her not to call it off. Then something seemed to click.</p>
<p>&#034;There's someone else, isn't there?&#034; But it was more of a statement than a question.</p>
<p>&#034;II don't know.&#034; she answered honestly. </p>
<p>&#034;What? How can you not know?&#034; He asked clearly not believing her.</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her ire rising as he continued to push her. &#034;Tom there is no one else. I've only been with you.&#034; She said with a snarl. &#034;I'm not the one chasing around all over the ship.&#034;</p>
<p>When no more information was forthcoming, he said. &#034;So this is about us having an open relationship. Why couldn't you just tell me before?&#034; He asked growing angry.</p>
<p>&#034;No, Tom. You don't under&#034; she began.</p>
<p>&#034;You know, B'Elanna,&#034; he said, feeling a sudden need to be hurtful, &#034;if I didn't feel like I had to wrestle with you in bed, maybe I wouldn't have wanted an open relationship!&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;What?&#034; she growled feeling her face flush in fury.</p>
<p>&#034;Yeah.&#034; He continued. &#034;Maybe I'd like some tenderness sometime instead of a fight!&#034;</p>
<p>Tom knew he was out of line, but couldn't seem to stop himself. It had hurt that B'Elanna seemed to be pushing him away and he gave in to the urge to lash out.</p>
<p>&#034;Okay, that's it.&#034; B'Elanna warned. &#034;You're right, the open relationship does bother me. If you love me, you should be happy with just me. Maybe that's why I'm feeling the way I do about Sesomeone else. I care about you, but things just aren't working out.</p>
<p>At her words, he suddenly felt the wind leave his lungs as he realized what was happening. He was about to lose the love of his life. All the fight abruptly went out of him.</p>
<p>&#034;I'm sorry.&#034; He said sincerely. &#034;I don't want to lose you.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I love you, Tom. But I need to work some things out in my mind. I'm not sure what my feelings are forthis other person. Maybe I'm reading things into the situation that simply aren't there. But, I have to know for sure.</p>
<p>&#034;I guess I can understand that. You need support right now. Not being pushed when you're not ready. Are you going to tell me who the lucky fella is?&#034; he asked in a vain attempt at humor.</p>
<p>&#034;No.&#034; she said gently. &#034;All I can tell you right now is that you are who I am involved with. I may be confused but I do still have honor. Just don't expect a lot from me right now.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Okay. How about if we go slowly.&#034; He suggested. &#034;Can I take you to dinner tomorrow? Chez Sandrines. I promise not to push.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Alright.&#034; She relented. &#034;Tomorrow.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt a grin start to curl her lips at the boyish enthusiasm on his face.</p>
<p>&#034;Dinner.&#034; She said feeling the ice start to melt around her heart.</p>
