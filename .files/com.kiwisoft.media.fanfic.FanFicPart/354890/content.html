<!-- New Frontier \ Part 6 -->

<p>Seven shook her head and then strutted in her usual stride to the captain's quarters. She rang the doorbell and waited for the captain's order for her to come.</p>

		<p>"Computer, what is Captain Janeway's location?"</p>

		<p>"She is in her quarters."</p>

		<p>"What is her status?"</p>

		<p>"She is not active."</p>

		<p>Seven keyed in a security code that she had seen Janeway use before and walked into her quarters. Within, she could hear Janeway snoring, quite loudly in fact, and set about making her dinner - pot roast which she knew was the captain's favorite. Fortunately, she could cook better than the captain and rarely burned anything. Let's hear it for Borg perfection. They may not eat, but they sure can cook.</p>

		<p>When dinner was finished, Seven woke the captain, told her that dinner was ready and waited for her to come out to the living room. She did, after a minute, dressed in her favorite comfy robe.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for forcing me to go to bed, Seven. I needed that," she said after a yawn. "And dinner, too."</p>

		<p>"I told you that I would make sure that you had dinner tonight."</p>

		<p>"But you must want to spend time with B'Elanna. You should go."</p>

		<p>"I will, after I make sure that you eat your supper."</p>

		<p>"Are you not eating?"</p>

		<p>"I am going to have dinner with B'Elanna. You need not worry for me."</p>

		<p>"I'll stop. I must sound like a mother hen."</p>

		<p>"No more than I," Seven said, sitting across from Kathryn, with elbow resting on the table and her head resting in her palm.</p>

		<p>"You look very starry eyed tonight, Seven."</p>

		<p>"What is that?"</p>

		<p>"You look in love, starry eyed. I sear I'll eat if you want to go to her. IT's no problem."</p>

		<p>"I have a question, actually," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Okay. Go ahead."</p>

		<p>"What was your first sexual experience like?"</p>

		<p>"Oh God," Kathryn groaned. She never expected to have this conversation with Seven, ever.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you uncomfortable."</p>

		<p>"No, it's not that. People just aren't as forward as you are. Seven. I never thought I'd have this conversation with you. I sure didn't have it with my mother."</p>

		<p>"Do you consider me to be your daughter?"</p>

		<p>"In a way. I didn't give birth to you, but we have that kind of relationship."</p>

		<p>"I do not know what it means to have a mother, unless it means that a mother will allow me to be assimilated by the Borg because of her thirst knowledge."</p>

		<p>"It doesn't mean that, Seven. I'm sure that she didn't mean to get you assimilated. It was an accident."</p>

		<p>"Because they became careless. They got too close. But what's done is done. I cannot change the past and will not because I would not have met you or B'Elanna, correct?"</p>

		<p>"Still, I wish you could have had more time with your parents. I had a wonderful relationship with my mother. We fought like cats and dogs occasionally like you and I do, but we always came back to each other, like you and I do, also. I don't want to take the place of your mother, Seven. No one could do that. I just want you to know that I care for you. You can tell me anything. I might moan and groan about it, but that's my own puritanical background coming back to haunt me again."</p>

		<p>"I would not like to call you mother, but I do consider you to have a very important role in my life that includes some of the duties that a mother at my age would perform, like providing advice. Am I correct in assuming that?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Are you going to answer my question?"</p>

		<p>"Uh, oh. Um, sure. What was it again?"</p>

		<p>"How was your first sexual experience?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes," Kathryn said. She thought back and then rolled her eyes. "Uh, Cheb Packer."</p>

		<p>"A male?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I'm afraid that it wasn't very good, Seven. We were teenagers fooling around and it hurt like hell."</p>

		<p>"Why did it hurt?"</p>

		<p>Janeway tried to explain the birds and the bees to Seven as cleanly as possible and how men and women were different. Seven knew all of the technicalities of it, but she didn't know the feelings associated with it.</p>

		<p>"Do you think that B'Elanna and I would be the same?"</p>

		<p>"I don't think so. You both have something that Cheb and I never had. You love each other and care about each other. Cheb and I were just looking to get our rocks off, so to speak."</p>

		<p>"Have you ever slept with a woman?"</p>

		<p>"Came really close once, but we cane to the Delta Quadrant and that ended that relationship. I have no idea what she is up to now."</p>

		<p>"Weren't you in a relationship with Mark Johnson at that time?"</p>

		<p>"We were on a break. I just wanted to make sure I knew what I was leaving behind if I married him."</p>

		<p>"But you never found."</p>

		<p>"No, I did not. Look, Seven. I'm sure that if you both take your time and not rush through anything, it will be fine and it'll even get better with time as you get to know your own body and to know hers. Just take it slow."</p>

		<p>"I will remember that, Kathryn."</p>

		<p>"Good. Go to her and I do not want to hear about it tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"We have tomorrow off, Kathryn. I doubt that I will see you tomorrow,"Seven said as she stood. Kathryn followed suit and then put her arms around Seven.</p>

		<p>"Good night, Seven. Remember, take it slow."</p>

		<p>"I will. I love you, Kathryn. Thank you for all of your support. You may talk to me about anything, as well. You do not need to keep it all inside."</p>

		<p>"I'll remember that, Seven. Now go. B'Elanna can be impatient at times."</p>

		<p>"Seven gave one of her rare smiles, turned and left Kathryn alone, and not for the first time, Kathryn felt truly alone.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Where is she?" B'Elanna asked as she paced throughout the living area of her quarters. The table was set for dinner, candles lit the room, flowers and music filled the air but weren't intrusive as she was dressed in her silkiest black dress. She wanted everything to be perfect for her perfect love.</p>

		<p>She flopped down on her couch, not caring a bit for modesty since she was alone. Her dress was way up her thighs, not displaying anything, but surely another inch or so would change that.</p>

		<p>The door opened and Seven stepped in. She smiled at the sight of the half-Klingon and tears came to her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I do not know why I feel like crying when I see you. You are so beautiful and make me so very happy," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Sometimes people cry when they're happy," B'Elanna whispered. Her breath was taken by Seven, dressed in the same outfit she wore before, but now bathed in candle light, her eyes glistened and her hair like spun gold.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna stood and they met each other in front of the coffee table. Their hands clasped and they stood looking into each other's eyes for an eternity, not speaking through words until B'Elanna spoke.</p>

		<p>"Did you eat dinner with the captain?"</p>

		<p>"I did not. I merely cooked dinner for her and we talked."</p>

		<p>"About what?"</p>

		<p>"I sought her advice. No, actually, I wanted to know of her experiences."</p>

		<p>"Of what?"</p>

		<p>"Her first time. She did not like it very much. She was not fulfilled. I am worried. Will our first time be as unfulfilling?"</p>

		<p>>That's more than I wanted to know about her,' B'Elanna thought t herself. "I don't know. It depends on a lot of things. Did she love the person?"</p>

		<p>"She said that they were two teenagers..."</p>

		<p>"Oh! It's never good when you're a teenager, Seven. You just futz around when you don't really know where anything is."</p>

		<p>"Was your first time bad?"</p>

		<p>"Kahless, it was awful!" B'Elanna exclaimed.</p>

		<p>"Did it hurt?"</p>

		<p>"A little. Have you read anything about this?"</p>

		<p>"Not about this aspect. I read mostly about how to please a woman. I did not research on what a first sexual experience would be like," Seven said, her brow furrowed.</p>

		<p>"Seven, when a human female is a virgin, she has a membrane up there that is called the hymen. When that is punctured through sexual intercourse that includes penetration, it occasionally hurts. Compound that with inexperience and the new sensation of someone being inside of you, it could be distressing for a girl. Most times, it is. It probably was Janeway and I know it was for me."</p>

		<p>"And that happens every time?"</p>

		<p>"No, just the first time. But Seven, we have something that teenagers don't really have a lot of the time. We love each other, baby, and I'm not out only to please myself like my first one was or maybe even the captain's. You can also talk to me about anything. Tell me what feels good and what you don't ever want me to do again and I'll do the same for you. We need to communicate. That will make it so much better than some teenagers in the back seat of a hover car."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded.</p>

		<p>"Are you still scared?"</p>

		<p>"A little."</p>

		<p>"I won't hurt you, Seven. I promise."</p>

		<p>"Will you bite me?"</p>

		<p>"Not unless you want me to," B'Elanna said with a smile. "Besides, I think we have that covered. You have bitten me already."</p>

		<p>"The Son of Kvor will not be visiting tonight."</p>

		<p>"Alright," B'Elanna said with a chuckle.</p>

		<p>"You do not wish to taste my blood like Klingon's do?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna groaned. Truth was that she did. She could smell Seven right then, but she didn't want to hurt her.</p>

		<p>"Come on," B'Elanna said as she pulled Seven out of her quarters. She took her to the sickbay and activated the EMH.</p>

		<p>"Please state the nature of the emergency," the doctor said before he turned around and saw Seven and B'Elanna. "Seven, what a pleasure it is to see you. Lieutenant." He nearly sneered at B'Elanna and the half-Klingon tried not to be insulted.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, we are requesting the highest amount of secrecy here," B'Elanna said. "You cannot talk to anyone about this. In fact, I prefer that you erase it from your memory files as soon as it is complete."</p>

		<p>"What is so urgent, Ms. Torres?"</p>

		<p>"I need you to take out some of Seven's blood, filter out the nanoprobes and give it to me."</p>

		<p>"What in heavens for?"</p>

		<p>"We are initiating mating and B'Elanna wishes not to bite me like I had in the past."</p>

		<p>"Oh. Why didn't you just say so?"</p>

		<p>The doctor put a hyprospray to Seven's neck, extracting a small amount of blood, and then programmed the hyprospray to take out the nanoprobes. He then handed over the vile to B'Elanna and wished them happy mating.</p>

		<p>"Not a word, Doctor," B'Elanna said as she dragged Seven out of the room and back to her quarters.</p>

		<p>"Isn't it better when it is warm?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>"This'll do," B'Elanna said. "Don't worry."</p>

		<p>"I am not worried with you, Lanna. I feel very safe. Are we going to make love now?"</p>

		<p>"Let's eat dinner first," B'Elanna said as she placed the sealed vile safely on the coffee table. She then held Seven's hand to her lips and kissed the palm. "You are very beautiful tonight. I forgot to tell you that."</p>

		<p>"Thank you. You are very beautiful tonight, too. Many people were admiring you in the hallway."</p>

		<p>"They were looking at you."</p>

		<p>"No, I'm quite sure they were looking at you, Lanna. You do not often show off your body like this. You are very... sexy."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled a shy smile and Seven kissed her lightly.</p>

		<p>"Perhaps we can delay dinner for a while," she suggested before she pulled Seven for a very deep and passionate kiss, freeing her hair in the process. Seven caressed her back through the thin silk as B'Elanna's hands wound in Seven's hair. "Oh, I didn't know what I was missing."</p>

		<p>"Neither did I," Seven said before she went in again. She lifted B'Elanna off the floor and took her to the bedroom. After laying her on the bed, Seven retrieved the vile from the living room. "Now?" she asked quietly.</p>

		<p>"Not just yet. Come here," B'Elanna slurred. Seven complied and allowed Lanna to unzip her biosuit and work it down her shoulders. "Your skin is like porcelain. I never imagined anyone to be so perfect."</p>

		<p>"You are mistaken. You are perfection," Seven said. Still mostly covered, she pulled B'Elanna's sheer covering over her head and marveled at the sight before her. New tears formed as her eyes danced over caramel skin, sculpted abs, handful sized breasts with fat brown nipples and a small indentation in the middle of her stomach. "What is that?"</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"Seven pointed to the indentation with a puzzled look on her face.</p>

		<p>"Oh, it's a belly button, Seven. You don't have one?"</p>

		<p>"I have an abdominal implant."</p>

		<p>"Oh."</p>

		<p>"What does it do?"</p>

		<p>"It's where a baby's umbilical cord to its mother was. It's how mothers feed their babies before they are born."</p>

		<p>"Oh. Seems efficient."</p>

		<p>"It is," B'Elanna said with a huge smile.</p>

		<p>Seven copied the smile and bent down. She kissed the belly button open mouthed and run her tongue around it. B'Elanna sighed at the intimate contact.</p>

		<p>"You enjoy this?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>Seven kissed the navel again and probed it with her tongue.</p>

		<p>"You're driving me crazy," B'Elanna moaned as she pulled Seven up and invaded her mouth with her tongue. Deftly, she pulled the rest of the biosuit off of Seven and allowed to pool on the floor. Seven stepped out of it and crawled up completely onto the bed, hovering over B'Elanna like a bird.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna flipped her lover onto her back and examined the nude body before her. It was true, she didn't have a navel, or if she did, it was covered by the surprisingly warm and soft metal that held her insides in like a corset.</p>

		<p>"Does that hurt?" B'Elanna asked as she ran her hand over it.</p>

		<p>"No. It is disgusting, I know."</p>

		<p>"It's beautiful, just like the rest of you. Don't think otherwise, ever."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna kissed where Seven's navel would be and then up between her breasts and to her mouth. She held her hand to Seven's hip and pulled her close, nudging a leg over hers. She could feel Seven's wetness against her thigh and it only served to inflame her more.</p>

		<p>Lanna reached for the vile and after pulling away slightly, she opened it and then painted the red blood on Seven's full lips, her collar bone and her nipples. She kissed Seven again, lapping at the blood with a fervent tongue. She felt the blood lust coming on strong now, but she had to control it for fear that she might hurt Seven. She never wanted to hurt his woman. She wanted to protect her and love her, not hurt her.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna kissed down Seven's body, gently nipping at her skin with her teeth but not breaking it. She cleared every trace of blood on her collar bone, leaving the flesh hot and pink.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Lanna," Seven moaned.</p>

		<p>"Yes, baby. You taste so good," she moaned in reply as she attacked her breasts. The nipples were stiffened to points and Seven sighed loudly when B'Elanna put her mouth around one. She flicked it with her tongue and drew as much as she could into her mouth. The blood was still warm. Both from Seven's body temperature and from B'Elanna's mouth. B'Elanna smiled inwardly. She felt Seven's blood pumping through her veins and knew that she belonged to this woman only.</p>

		<p>"I am yours, always," B'Elanna said as she looked into Seven's blue eyes, the color of ocean off of Jamaica.</p>

		<p>"I belong to you," Seven said, holding B'Elanna's face in her hands. "You belong to me," she growled.</p>

		<p>"Yes," B'Elanna replied meekly. She would do that for no other and she had definitely never done it for Tom.</p>

		<p>"Louder," Seven insisted.</p>

		<p>"I belong to you," B'Elanna said in a slightly louder voice.</p>

		<p>"Show it," her lover demanded and B'Elanna smiled.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna pushed Seven on her back and held her hands above her head. She kissed the blonde fiercely and pushed her hips between her lover's thighs. The blood lust was taking over now. She knew that she wasn't going to hurt Seven, but Seven had given her permission to show all the passion she held for the woman.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna nipped down her body, letting go over hands and nuzzled the blonde hair at the juncture of her legs. Seven held her there, feeling an ache between her thighs that she had ever felt before, at least to that extent. B'Elanna broke free of it and pulled back to start kissing her ankle and then up the right leg along the Borg implant running there. It sent shivers up and down Seven's spine and a new flood of moisture accumulated in her and even on the bed coverings. B'Elanna chuckled at this new development and then ever so slowly, she approached the center of Seven's body.</p>

		<p>She kissed the outer folds softly and blew on them with hot breath that seemed cooling to Seven because she was so hot. She opened her legs wider and begged for B'Elanna's entrance. B'Elanna complied and buried her face in Seven's wet heat. She instinctively knew what to do and sought out that bundle of nerves that she loved having caressed so much. She licked at it, sucked on it, nibbled on it and lapped at it, creating interesting patterns and eliciting approving verbal responses from her lover.</p>

		<p>The pressure in Seven's body kept building. She opened her legs wider and then crossed her ankles on B'Elanna's back. B'Elanna held on tight, keeping her hands on Seven's waist. Seven started bucking against her ministrations and B'Elanna had to work hard not to lose her place. Within seconds, Seven was screaming into the night as her hips rose in one last stand against the experience.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna eased her out of it and moved up to kiss her lover sweetly. "You are so beautiful when you come. You look like an animal," B'Elanna whispered in her ear. "I am yours."</p>

		<p>"Yes," Seven with her chest still heaving. "You are mine."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled and drew Seven into her arms as she laid back on the bed. "Was that a pleasurable experience?"</p>

		<p>"Very. I will have to tell Kathryn to find a female lover. She does not know what she is missing," Seven said quietly as she traced B'Elanna's lips with her finger.</p>

		<p>"You won't tell her the details, will you?"</p>

		<p>"No. She does not want the details. I will just tell her that it was a very satisfying first time."</p>

		<p>"She'll be jealous and want to steal me from you."</p>

		<p>"But you are mine. She will not steal you."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled proudly and puffed up her chest. Seven took the opportunity to begin tracing a nipple with her finger, her touch feather light.</p>
