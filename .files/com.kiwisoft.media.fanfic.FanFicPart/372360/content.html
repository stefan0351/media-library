SIX</b></p>
<p>As Lilly tucked both of her hands between her head and the leathery armrest of the three-seater couch placed in the middle of Hannah Montana's dressing room (facing a gorgeous flat screen that Lilly had almost drooled over), she fixed her cold stare on the ceiling directly above her. The faux-blonde bombshell was on stage performing for her fans – it had been a special event, celebrating the rockstar's 18th birthday which had supposedly taken place two days before, but was actually tonight. Lilly knew that Miley liked having time for herself on her birthday, but she figured she'd let Hannah have a little fun. Miley would be celebrating with friends and family the next night. Lilly had a kick-ass present for Miley, and she knew it would go over well if she ever got the balls to give it to her.</p>
<p>Just like that, Lilly went to thinking about the concert she didn't feel like watching to the girl that had sparked something dangerous inside of her. It felt just like she had gotten a joy-buzzer to the heart – or some place a little more south of the border. God, why did she even try to nap during a concert anyway? She knew better than anyone that she shouldn't be left alone with her thoughts to keep her company, but no one had stopped her from walking away from the wings of the stage.</p>
<p>Lilly retreated into Hannah's dressing room a little over halfway into the show, ripping Lola's bright blue hair from her head and shaking her own hair loose, the knowledge that she was letting her friend down weighing heavily on her shoulders. In all the years she's known that Hannah was actually Miley, she hasn't missed a single concert and she's always stayed standing right where Miley could see her the entire time. How would Miley feel now that Lola wasn't standing there, cheering her on?</p>
<p>Her excuses for leaving were good, though, Lilly reasoned with herself. She honestly didn't know if she could stand watching Miley on stage, with that kind of energy and those new dance moves and those damn <i>hips </i>covered by very tight pants and a studded belt. Even now, her eyes slid shut and she could easily picture Miley rocking those hips to a very different beat.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what was tearing her up more – the fact that Miley had touched her, or the fact that she regretted stopping her. If she had the choice to do it all over again, she'd probably let Miley continue. Miley had wanted to keep going. Lilly knew that for sure, if the look that Miley had given her was any indication.</p>
<p>Miley Stewart was still her best friend and always would be, but something inside Lilly stirred. Maybe they could be something more than just best friends. Maybe they could use this and grow closer than ever. Lilly knew that Miley wanted these things. She wanted Lilly as more than just a best friend, and… Lilly had wanted that too. Before Miley's dreams, before Miley flipped out, before Miley had kissed her and stuck her hand down Lilly's pants… Lilly knew she had started to feel something more than just friendly feelings for her best friend.</p>
<p>…<i>Only my best friend.</i> Lilly thought to herself with a frown as she flipped to a channel displaying a courtroom. Those feelings had steadily grown, but she couldn't even imagine Miley feeling the same way about her. But was what Miley felt even real? Did she have feelings for Lilly or the Lilly of her dreams?</p>
<p>Lilly didn't think she could let anything happen until both she and Miley figured that out. Maybe more space would be the best thing for them right now. She couldn't let this come between them and ruin anything they could possibly have in the future.</p>
<p>She was right, wasn't she? She was doing the right thing by halting whatever was happening between the two of them?</p>
<p>After all, beneath that straight and shiny blonde hair that made up the Hannah Montana persona was still her best friend, and she couldn't lose her.</p>
<p>But if <i>Miley</i> did something… Lilly pondered this for a moment.</p>
<p>Miley was her best friend who clearly wanted more from her, but wouldn't do anything about it. She wouldn't make a move on Lilly or make her in any way uncomfortable, Miley had made that clear.</p>
<p>Still, there was a single thought that relayed through her brain, seemingly on loop.</p>
<p>Does she <i>want</i> Miley to do something about it?</p>
<p>"<i>Hey, ya'll. I've had a wonderful time tonight. I want to thank ya'll for coming out here to party with me on my 18th</i><i>birthday, but the night is almost over. I have one more song to sing tonight, and it's dedicated to a very good friend of mine who happens to be with me tonight. We've been going through some rough times lately, and I want to thank her for sticking by me. She's</i>one in a million<i>."</i></p>
<p>Lilly exhaled sharply, feeling as if the air had been knocked out of her lungs. "Huh. What do you know…? I guess I do."</p>
<p>Lilly then sat up and curled up on the far right end of the couch, keeping her eyes trained on the door that Miley would be walking through soon enough. As she usually did, Miley walked through the door exactly ten minutes later. Robbie Ray and Jackson were behind her, though they lingered in the doorway.</p>
<p>"We're gonna be leavin' in about an hour, girls." Robbie Ray told them, placing his hand on Jackson's shoulder. "Me an' Jackson have somethin' to do out there, but we'll come get you when it's time to leave. Make sure my little girl gets some rest, will you?"</p>
<p>Lilly glanced at Miley, watching as she paled considerably at her father's words. "Will do, Mr. M."</p>
<p>Both girls said their goodbyes to the boys as they left, shutting the door behind them. Miley collapsed onto the far left side of the couch and started yanking her boots off, tossing them to the floor without bothering to even remove her wig.</p>
<p>"You heard your dad," Lilly told her. "You need to lie down and relax. Close your eyes for more than five seconds."</p>
<p>Miley frowned and crossed her legs, folding her arms over her chest, not budging from her spot. Lilly eyed her, understanding that Miley was deliberately leaving space between them.</p>
<p>"Miley Ray Stewart, I will not tell you again." Lilly's icy tone got Miley's attention.</p>
<p>The blonde fixed her with a hard look until Miley finally stretched her legs out along the couch, her feet coming to a rest on Lilly's lap while her head snuggled comfortably into the armrest.</p>
<p>"Thank you." Lilly finally relented, watching as Miley's eyes slid shut. "I don't care what you dream about – just <i>sleep</i>."</p>
<p>"I can't be held responsible for how I act in my sleep," Miley said a moment later, her voice laced with sleep. "So if I sleep-jump you, you can't blame me."</p>
<p>Lilly's eyebrows shot up, but she eased them back down with minor difficulty. "Watch yourself, Miles."</p>
<p>A sleepy grin spread across Miley's face, and a few moments later she was asleep, her lips pouting as she slept. Lilly grabbed the remote and lowered the volume a few notches, then tossed it on the table in front of her. Her hands settled on Miley's feet, her fingers poking at the bright purple toes attached to the feet that Miley had so casually thrown on her lap. She ran her hand over Miley's ankles as she trained her eyes on the television. Not even twenty minutes later, Lilly started to trail her fingers up along the smooth skin of Miley's shin and she could clearly hear something other than the television in front of her. She swiveled her head to the left as she heard the sound again, the purple-colored toenails dipping as her toes curled. Miley's lips parted and released a throaty groan, her head tilting back only slightly.</p>
<p>Lilly nearly jumped out of her skin as her name fell from Miley's mouth in rapid succession only a few moments later.</p>
<p>One question burned brightly as she watched her friend release more breathy sounds: <i>What the hell am I supposed to do now?</i></p>
