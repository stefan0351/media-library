<!-- In Healing Arms \ Conclusion -->

<p>Alex ran out of the kitchen searching for Tracey and Edna. She
			found Edna talking to a couple of her friends. She rushed over to her and immediately had
			tears streaming down her face. Edna looked at her niece and new something was terribly
			wrong.</p>

		<p>"What is it honey? You look very upset." Edna said very
			concerned.</p>

		<p>"I...I don't know what to say Eddi. Sydney....she....oh my
			God.." Alex whispered out through her sobs. She felt Edna pull her into a hug and
			quietly sobbed as onlookers gave them their privacy.</p>

		<p>"What did Sydney do honey? I can't help if I don't know what
			happened." Eddi comforted.</p>

		<p>"Not here, let's go into the other room. Where's
			Tracey?" She asked.</p>

		<p>"She is over there having a drinking contest. I think she is
			winning." She said as they looked over to Tracey pointing and laughing at her
			opponent on the floor.</p>

		<p>"Oh no...that's going to make matters worse." She said sadly.</p>

		<p>"What? Girl, you tell me right now what is going on
			here??" Edna demanded.</p>

		<p>Alex looked around and noticed that they were pretty much alone
			and it wouldn't make a difference if she told her here or not.</p>

		<p>"Sydney's ex-girlfriend is in my kitchen right now."
			She choked out.</p>

		<p>"What? What are you talking about child?" Edna asked.</p>

		<p>"Char, Tracey's girlfriend is really Sharon, Sydney's
			ex."</p>

		<p>"Oh my God."</p>

		<p>"Yeah I know. I don't know how I am going to tell Tracey. She is really in love with
			this woman. I don't know how. That woman is a total bitch. I was shaking in there I was so
			angry. Then she starting talking about Sydney and how she killed her brother."</p>

		<p>"Whoa, whoa whoa. Hold it right there. Sydney killed her brother?" Edna asked
			incredulously.</p>

		<p>"I don't know the whole story. Sydney seemed pretty upset by
			the accusations, but Sharon said that she was no better than the people that killed mom
			and dad!" She started breathing heavily. "I just don't know what to believe. I
			am so confused Eddi. I don't' know what to do. I have to tell Tracey that her girlfriend
			is a maniacal bitch, AND tonight I find out that my girlfriend killed her own brother. I
			AM LOSING MY MIND!! I just couldn't handle anymore so I ran out of there and found
			you." Alex shouted out.</p>

		<p>"Oh my...." Edna couldn't believe what she was hearing.
			She had to do something fast. There was something that just didn't click here. She had
			known Sydney for the last three years. She knew that woman couldn't kill anyone. "We
			have to tell Tracey before she finds out another way. I think we need to sit her down and
			tell her before she is too drunk to comprehend what we are saying to her." Edna
			rationalized.</p>

		<p>"Good idea Eddi, let's go get her." Alex agreed.</p>

		<p>They walked over to the bar where Tracey was challenging everyone
			to a beer chugging contest. Alex walked behind her an tapped her on the shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Tracey? I need to talk to you. It's really important."</p>

		<p>"Can't it wait Alex? I'm about to make fifty bucks off this guy." Tracey
			answered without looking at Alex.</p>

		<p>Alex put her hand on Tracey's shoulder and made her look at her.
			"Trace, it's really important. Please." Alex almost pleaded.</p>

		<p>"OK, Babe. What is it?"</p>

		<p>*Crash*</p>

		<p>"What the hell?" Tracey looked at Alex and Edna after
			hearing the crash and knew something was up. "Where's Char guys?" Tracey asked.
			Tracey ran towards the kitchen where the crashing sound had come from.</p>

		<p>"Tracey wait!!" Alex screamed unsuccessfully.
			"Dammit. We got to catch her!" Alex said to Eddi as they ran after Tracey.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tracey ran into the kitchen and was flabbergasted with what she
			saw. Sydney had still had Sharon up agains the cabinets with her hand on her throat. Edna
			and Alex soon followed into the kitchen.</p>

		<p>"Holy shit! Sydney what the fuck are you doing?? Let go of
			her!! NOW!" Tracey screamed and ran towards Sydney and Sharon.</p>

		<p>"Tracey no! It's not what you think!" Alex tried to
			warn her.</p>

		<p>Sydney half turned to see Tracey coming after her. "Tracey
			stop right there. This is not the woman you think it is." Sydney tried to say as she
			felt Tracey's hands around her neck. </p>

		<p>"Tracey no!! Stop!" Alex screamed.</p>

		<p>"What is your problem Alex? She is attacking my girlfriend!"</p>

		<p>"She's not your girlfriend Tracey...she is my ex-lover, Sharon." Sydney choked
			out.</p>

		<p>"What are you talking about? Char tell her it's not
			true." Tracey said looking up into her lover's eyes. Sharon looked at Tracey with a
			blank expression. "Char? Char, what's going on? Talk to me." Tracey said as she
			released her hold on Sydney's throat. Sydney backed away to reveal the woman that Tracey
			had grown to love. Although this time Tracey was looking into the eyes of a stranger.
			"She's telling the truth isn't she?"</p>

		<p>Sharon didn't flinch or attempt to answer the question. Tracey, being more than a little
			tipsy, slapped Sharon across her face. "WHY? Why would you lie to me like this? I
			thought you loved me." More blood trickled from Sharon's nose and she licked it with
			her tongue and smiled.</p>

		<p>"Oh poor young Tracey. I give you some sack time, which was
			mediocre at best, some warm embraces, and you think it's love? You just kept me warm until
			I could have what I really wanted." Tracey snarled, reached back and punched Sharon's
			face. She reached back again only to have Sydney grab her arm.</p>

		<p>"That's enough Tracey. Alex call the police. We have an
			unwanted guest here." They looked at Sharon who was just sitting on the counter
			staring into nothingness with a small smile on her face.</p>

		<p>"Sharon, you have hurt my friends for the last time. I'm
			going to have you put in jail for breaking and entering. If you're lucky, you won't have
			anything else on your record to keep you there longer." Alex said to the numb woman.
			She looked at Sydney and mouthed "I'm so sorry." Sydney walked over to her and
			put her arms around her.</p>

		<p>"I'm the one who is sorry honey. I shouldn't have kept this
			from you. I promise when all of this is over, I will tell you the whole story."</p>

		<p>"OK then, after this is over. I have a phone call to make. I'll be right back."
			She turned to leave the room, looked into the bar area and looked back into the kitchen.
			"You know, it's a good thing these people really like to party, because this would be
			really hard to explain right about now." Sydney looked at her partner and smiled. </p>

		<p>Sydney looked over to Sharon's unbalanced expression and wondered
			what she ever saw in her. The beauty that once radiated off of this woman was now gone.
			Everything about her had changed for the worse. She knew now how lucky she was to have
			found Alexandra. Of course, she always knew that part.</p>

		<p>Tracey just sat at the kitchen table and just stared at Sharon.
			It was unbelievable to her what had just unfolded. The woman who had loved her for the
			last few months was nothing more than a lying Sociopath. She buried her head in her hands
			and began to weep. Sydney walked over to her and put her hand on her shoulder.</p>

		<p>"I'm so sorry I brought her into your life Tracey." She
			whispered to the crying woman.</p>

		<p>Sharon watched the exchange and reached down to pick up a piece
			of the broken bottle from the counter. She had the glass in her palm and slowly slid off
			the counter. Edna saw her move and motioned too late to Sydney. Sharon quickly raised her
			weaponed hand and rushed towards Sydney.</p>

		<p>"IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU, THAN NO ONE CAN! YAAAAH" She
			shouted as she raised her hand to make the strike.</p>

		<p>"Sydney! Look out!" Edna screamed.</p>

		<p>Sydney whirled around and caught Sharon's raised arm before it
			made impact. Alex heard her aunt scream and ran into the kitchen after her call to the
			police. Tracey got behind Sharon and grabbed Sharon's other arm and shoved it behind her
			back.</p>

		<p>"Drop it Sharon, or whatever your name is!" Tracey shot
			out.</p>

		<p>Sharon grunted and dropped the piece of glass on the floor. She
			started to kick and scream and Tracey threw her down onto the floor. Pieces of the broken
			glass dug into Tracey's knees and into Sharon's body. Sydney traded places with Tracey
			since she had a better advantage over Sharon.</p>

		<p>"Sydney honey, are you all right?" Alex ran to her
			side. </p>

		<p>"Yes darlin. We just need to wait for the cops now. We can
			add attempted murder to her sheet and she should be put away for a good long time. Maybe
			they'll put her into a mental hospital. I think she would benefit greatly from that."
			Sydney smirked as she tightened her grip on Sharon's twisted arm.</p>

		<p>"You think some shrink is gonna stop me from coming back to
			get you Sydney? Think again. I am going to haunt you until the day you die. You will never
			be able to forget me, I promise you that." Sharon spat into the floor.</p>

		<p>"You're right Sharon, I won't forget you. I will remember
			how you actually helped me to become a person again after Billy died. I do regret,
			however, the fact that I don't have any other fond memories of us together. I feel nothing
			but pity for you, but at least I know what love is now. It's exactly the opposite of what
			we had together. So, for that, I thank you." Sydney said sarcastically.</p>

		<p>"Fuck you!" Sharon cried out.</p>

		<p>"In your dreams Sharon." Alex hissed. Sydney looked up
			at Alex and smiled a full smile at her love. She knew that nothing had really changed
			between them. It was just a matter of finishing her story to Alex. </p>

		<p>"Hey! Someone called the cops!" A voice shouted from
			the other room. Alex giggled to herself and went to the door to welcome the arriving
			officers.</p>

		<p>"Evening ma'am. We got a call that you had an intruder this
			evening?" One of the officers asked.</p>

		<p>"Oh how I wish it were that simple. Follow me." Alex explained with a grin on
			her face.</p>

		<p>She led the officers into the kitchen. Most of the people had
			left the party already and the ones that remained just stared at the entering policemen.</p>

		<p>"Well, what do we have here?" The first officer asked. </p>

		<p>Sydney looked up and it was the officer from the liquor store.
			She recognized him and she smiled up at him and rolled her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Seems like you are doing our jobs again for us tonight. You
			are a busy woman." He smiled at Sydney.</p>

		<p>"Again? Sydney?" Alex questioned.</p>

		<p>"Long story." Sydney replied.</p>

		<p>"Another one?" Alex teased. Sydney just raised her brow
			at Alex and grinned.</p>

		<p>"Unfortunately." She quipped back.</p>

		<p>Sydney moved off of a struggling Sharon and the officers
			handcuffed her. The second officer stood Sharon up and motioned for her to walk out of the
			kitchen. She turned to face Sydney.</p>

		<p>"See you soon, my sweet." Sharon said.</p>

		<p>"Not if I see you first." Sydney answered quickly.</p>

		<p>Sharon was taken out of the house and placed into the squad car.
			The first officer questioned Alex and Sydney as to what happened.</p>

		<p>"Long story short, her name is Sharon Harris. She stalked me
			for three years just to cause me harm. She tried to kill me with a piece of broken glass
			in a kitchen she wasn't invited into and I want to file charges on all counts."
			Sydney plainly stated with her arms across her chest.</p>

		<p>"Would you like to elaborate any on this?" The officer
			smiled.</p>

		<p>"OK, three years ago........"</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney relayed as much information she could bear to remember. The officer was amazed that
			this woman hadn't been committed to a psyche ward sooner. In his opinion, "she is a
			couple cents short of a dime."</p>

		<p>"Thank you Officer Randy, good to see you again."
			Sydney kidded.</p>

		<p>"Thank you Sydney. Alex I'm sorry your birthday turned out
			this way, but rest assured, we will take care of Ms. Harris. Have a good night ladies.
			Well, what's left of it." He said as he checked his watch.</p>

		<p>"Good night." Both Alex and Sydney said in unison.</p>

		<p>They closed the front door and realized that the four of them;
			Sydney, Alex, Edna, and Tracey, were the only ones left in the house. When the police
			showed up, the party pretty much broke up. They all took a seat at the bar and did a shot
			of Cuervo.</p>

		<p>Alex had tended to Sydney's wounds and Edna to Tracey's. Tracey
			still hadn't absorbed everything that had happened this evening, but it would all sink in
			soon enough for her.</p>

		<p>"God, I just can't believe all of this. What the hell would
			drive someone to that?" Tracey asked.</p>

		<p>"I don't know hon, I'm just glad that she didn't physically
			hurt you." Alex said as she wrapped her arm around her best friend's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Sharon is sick, that's all there is to it. I can't think of
			any sane person that would do this." Edna threw in.</p>

		<p>"Obsession is a scary thing. I hope this is the one and only
			time I get to be the subject matter." Sydney chuckled half joking, half serious.</p>

		<p>"Well kids, thanks for the excitement, but I have to go. I
			have to get my sorry butt to Indy." Edna exclaimed.</p>

		<p>"Aww Eddi, are you sure you can't postpone your trip? Just
			for a day?" Alex asked.</p>

		<p>"Aww honey, you don't need me here. My limo is waiting for
			me outside. Besides I do believe you have other plans for the rest of the evening. It's
			your birthday for cryin-out-loud! Have some fun tonight! I'll see you back in Montana when
			you get back. OK?" Edna replied.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for coming Eddi. It meant so much to me that you
			were here. I'm just sorry for the way that things ended. I just hope they lock her up for
			a good long time." Alex said as she hugged her aunt. "Have a safe trip Eddi, and
			please call me when you get in, you know how I am." Alex said as she pulled away from
			the hug.</p>

		<p>"I love you Alex. Take care of her." She said quietly
			as she pointed to Tracey. "I think she's gonna need some TLC from you."</p>

		<p>"I will."</p>

		<p>"Edna, it was wonderful to see you again. I know it meant the world to Alexandra for
			you to be here for her birthday. I'll be back at work soon, boss lady." Sydney
			laughed as she hugged Edna good-bye. Edna laughed with her and then turned to face Tracey.</p>

		<p>"Tracey, I'm so sorry hon. If there is anything that I can
			do for you, please, you know my number. Come here child." Edna said as she opened her
			arms for Tracey to fall into.</p>

		<p>"Thanks Edna. You seem to make things feel better, with just
			one hug. No wonder Alex loves you as much as she does. Take good care of yourself. Have a
			safe trip and good luck at the auction."</p>

		<p>"Thanks Tracey. Alright ladies, good night and take care. I'm off to Indy. Bye
			now." She said with a final wave of her hand.</p>

		<p>She went upstairs to retrieve the remainder of her bags and
			Sydney helped her get them into the limousine. With one final kiss and a wave, Edna was
			off and Sydney walked back into the house.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Tracey, you know you can just spend the night here. It's
			kinda late." Alex insisted.</p>

		<p>"No Alex, thanks, but I have so much to sort out. It's
			really hard for me to process everything that went down tonight. It's all just so surreal
			right now. I guess I am still waiting to wake up from this nightmare."</p>

		<p>"I know what you mean." The low sensual voice of Sydney came from over Alex's
			head.</p>

		<p>"Hey you, did Eddi get off OK?" Alex said as she was
			hugged from behind.</p>

		<p>"Yeah she did. Did I hear you were leaving Tracey?" Syd
			asked.</p>

		<p>"I gotta. I have lots to think about. I appreciate the offer
			Alex, but I really think I need to go home." Tracey reasoned.</p>

		<p>"Let us drive you at least. You have had quite a bit to
			drink tonight." Alex compromised. Tracey knew not to argue this point with Alex and
			her past experiences with drunk driving.</p>

		<p>"OK, babe. You win. I know I can't win that argument."
			Her friend acquiesced. "I'll get my stuff together. Be right back."</p>

		<p>"K, Trace. We'll be right here." Alex shouted at her friend's back.</p>

		<p>Alex turned to face Sydney. They studied each other for long
			moments before slowly embracing each other. The warmth and love they felt for each other
			came out in full force with this embrace.</p>

		<p>"I love you Alexandra. I'm so sorry I wasn't completely
			honest with you. It almost cost me everything."</p>

		<p>"Sydney, there is still a piece to this puzzle that I need to know, but I also know
			that you would never lie to me. I know there is a very good reason that you didn't tell me
			about the death of your brother. I will just wait until we are alone and comfortable to
			talk more about it. I love you too Syd. I always will."</p>

		<p>"That's so good to know." She leaned down and slowly and tenderly kissed Alex's
			lips. The kiss deepened and the women found their embrace becoming more and more needy.
			Sydney's tongue demanded entrance and Alex didn't fight it. She willingly took in the hot
			moist muscle between her lips and began to suck on it.</p>

		<p>Sydney's body pressed against Alex's and they began their private
			dance of desire. Alex pulled away suddenly and had a look of confusion on her face.</p>

		<p>"Where's Tracey? I don't want her to find us like this. It
			may upset her with everything that's happened." Alex said as she felt her neck being
			nibbled on by Sydney. "Oh God, that feels good. I totally know why Sharon wanted you
			back."</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, no more talk about that woman tonight OK?" Sydney asked softly but
			seriously.</p>

		<p>"Deal, I'm sorry. I am, though, going to go upstairs to
			check on Tracey. She should have been down here already." </p>

		<p>"OK, I'll come with you." Sydney said.</p>

		<p>"Is that a promise for later as well?" Alex said as she
			waggled her eyebrows.</p>

		<p>"You are such a naughty girl. Come on. Let's see about your
			intoxicated friend upstairs."</p>

		<p>"OK Love, after you." </p>

		<p>The two women walked up the stairs hand in hand. They walked into
			Alex's room and there was no sign of Tracey. Alex turned and walked down the hall to her
			parents' room. She opened the door and looked into another empty room.</p>

		<p>"Alex, I think I found her. Come here." Alex heard
			Sydney say. Alex ran down the hall to follow Sydney's voice.</p>

		<p>"Syd? Where are you?" Alex called out with a bit of
			panic in her voice.</p>

		<p>"Shh, in the guest room." She whispered.</p>

		<p>Alex walked into the guestroom to find Tracey under the covers of
			the bed in the fetal position. She was lying on one pillow with another one in her arms.</p>

		<p>"God, I feel so bad for her. On top of everything with
			Sharon, she is going to wake up with one helluva hangover." Alex sympathetically
			commented.</p>

		<p>"Yeah I don't envy the headache, she'll have. Come on you, I've got some 'splainin to
			do." Sydney said in her best Ricky Ricardo.</p>

		<p>"Yeah you do. Come on Ricky." She giggled back and
			silently closed the door.</p>

		<p>Syd and Alex walked down the long hallway into Alex's room and
			shut the door. They both undressed and got into the bed. Sydney opened her arms for Alex
			to snuggle into. It was their favorite position to sleep in, and not to sleep in. They got
			themselves situated and Alex felt Sydney stiffen a bit and knew that she was ready to
			talk.</p>

		<p>"OK, are you ready hon? I just want this over with."
			Sydney asked as if to gear herself up.</p>

		<p>"Sure, baby, whenever you are." She said as she
			snuggled closer to her lover.</p>

		<p>"OK, what Sharon said about Billy was true at one time. I
			completely blamed myself for his death. I didn't kill him, so to speak, but I felt totally
			responsible for his death. We were having a brawl that night with one of the other gangs.
			He knew that they were going to be bringing some heavy stuff with them."</p>

		<p>"Heavy stuff?" Alex asked.</p>

		<p>"You know like guns and shit like that."</p>

		<p>"Oh, OK."</p>

		<p>"Anyway, he begged me not to go that night. He was always the peacemaker. After dad
			died he tried to be the man of the family. He was such a gentle soul, but very passionate
			about family. He was really worried for me. He knew what we did and he hated that I was
			involved in it. He didn't understand why I needed to be with these people. Looking back, I
			don't know what I thought I got from them either, but like I said, I was really lost at
			that time. Anyway, he had heard that the leader was gonna be packing guns that night. He
			urged me to stay home. I told him I wasn't going to change my mind. He just wouldn't
			listen. I told him to stay away if he didn't like it. He didn't. </p>

		<p>"He showed up that night and tried to talk some sense into
			me. Before I even saw him approach, he walked into a line of fire. Someone had shot him.
			Bullets were flying everywhere and all I could do was watch him fall. The cops came and
			everyone scrambled out of there. Billy bled to death in my arms." Sydney paused to
			control the emotions that were seeping through her pores. "He told me that he loved
			me, and that he would do it all again, if it meant keeping me alive. I still don't think I
			will ever understand that kind of love. Family was the most important thing to him though.
			He also said he knew how mom was going to react, boy was he right. She blamed me for all
			of it, which I don't fault her for. I was a terror at that point in my life. Timmy and I
			weren't speaking, then of course he sided with mom, so my life was completely shit at that
			time. I wouldn't relive that time for anything in this world.</p>

		<p>"There was a trial but the shooter's ass was covered by his
			people. His name was never even brought into the courtroom. They dismissed the case
			because they had no real suspects. Billy was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
			Just like that, Billy became a statistic. I miss him terribly. His death was very wrong,
			just like your parents'. I just didn't think the timing was right for me to tell you about
			him. I didn't want to upset you anymore than you already were. I wanted to give you as
			much time as possible to mourn the loss of your folks, before I laid this on you. I'm
			sorry Alexandra. I won't keep anything from you ever again. I promise you that." </p>

		<p>"That is a promise that I will hold you to my dear
			Sydney." Alex said as she kissed the soft flesh beneath her lips.</p>

		<p>"Mmm, I do believe it's still someone's birthday. You may
			have whatever you like." Sydney said in a very sexy throaty voice.</p>

		<p>"God Sydney you give me chills when you talk like
			that." Alex shivered.</p>

		<p>"Like what, Alexandra?" She whispered into the younger
			woman's ears.</p>

		<p>"You are such a tease Sydney."</p>

		<p>"No Alexandra, I do believe a tease is someone that only pretends to offer something
			they have no intention of giving up. I have every intention of giving you whatever it is
			you desire tonight."</p>

		<p>"Really? Well then, I take it back. You are not a tease."</p>

		<p>"Thank you."</p>

		<p>"You are a seductress."</p>

		<p>"That, I cannot argue with." Sydney said as she leaned over and flipped Alex
			onto her back. She kissed her soundly on the lips and their dance of desire played out
			once more. The kisses turned feral, the need to reconnect with each other was prominent
			with every movement. Sydney covered Alex's naked body with her own. She kissed and licked
			every inch of Alex's neck and throat. She nipped and suckled Alex's ears until every inch
			of Alex's body was covered in goosebumps.</p>

		<p>She moved slowly southward until she came to Alex's fully erect
			nipples. She took one into her mouth as she caressed the other with her fingers. Alex
			gasped at the sensation and pulled Syd's head closer to her body. Alex's body started
			gyrating into Sydney. Sydney pressed down with her own body to absorb every shock that
			Alex gave her. She teased the nipple with the tip of her tongue and gently nipped at it
			with her teeth. Alex started to moan with pleasure as Syd's hand roamed slowly downward
			until it reached it's destination.</p>

		<p>She gently moved her fingers across Alex's soaked pubic hairs.
			Sydney pressed the heel of her hand against Alex's clitoris and Alex began to grind into
			it.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, God, you feel so good."</p>

		<p>"Good baby, so do you." Syd whispered hoarsely back to her lover.</p>

		<p>Alex's movements became more fervent. She needed to feel this
			with Sydney again. Sydney spread Alex's legs farther apart to gain better access to her
			lover's passion. She moved her body down Alex's to breathe in her essence. She could smell
			the arousal and wanted very much to taste the nectar waiting for her. She climbed in
			between Alex's legs and placed tiny kissed up and down her inner thighs. She finally
			placed a kiss on the apex of Alex's legs. Alex took a deep breath and slowly felt her
			body's control leave her; Sydney was in control of her now. Sydney spread Alex's lips open
			and gently teased her excited clitoris with the tip of her tongue. Alex's body tried to
			shoot off the bed, but Sydney held onto her so she could not escape her erotic torture.</p>

		<p>Alex was in a state euphoria. Everything was right again in their
			world. She was being loved by the most incredible woman on the planet. Sydney's tongue
			picked up it's pace when she felt Alex's body responding to her touches. She inserted two
			fingers into Alex and felt the smaller woman push onto her invasive digits. Alex's voice
			was picking up volume with each stroke of Sydney's fingers and tongue.</p>

		<p>"God baby, ungh, harder, please." Alex begged. </p>

		<p>Sydney added a third finger to her arsenal and felt Alex's body
			respond wholeheartedly. Alex's body was grinding into Sydney's as she felt her getting
			closer and closer to release. A few more strokes of Sydney's tongue and Alex was screaming
			to any god that would listen. Sydney didn't stop her assault until she heard Alex begging
			her to do just that. Sydney's release drowned out Alex's voice for a brief moment. After
			her body stopped it's convulsions, she was able to hear her again.</p>

		<p>"Oh my God, Sydney. That was incredible." Alex panted
			out.</p>

		<p>"No baby, you are incredible. I love making love with you. I
			can release myself, by just loving you. I have never been able to do that with anyone
			else."</p>

		<p>"That does take talent." She giggled. "Hey come up
			here, I want to hold you." Alex said as she felt her partner crawl up her body to
			embrace hers.</p>

		<p>"God this is home to me Sydney. You, here with me is my
			home. Some people think that home is a place. I think it could be a person. For me, that
			person is you Sydney. God, I love you so much." She said as she kissed Sydney
			tenderly.</p>

		<p>Several kisses later the two women were disturbed by the phone
			ringing.</p>

		<p>Alex grunted, "Who the hell could that be? It's almost the
			middle of the night. I'm just going to let the machine get it."</p>

		<p>"Are you sure you want to do that? I mean, not to make you worry, but it could be
			Edna."</p>

		<p>"Oh Shit, you are right." Alex said as she grabbed the phone off the night
			stand. "Hello?"</p>

		<p>"Alex McKenna?"</p>

		<p>"Speaking, who is this?" Alex asked.</p>

		<p>"Hi there, it's Officer Randy. I just wanted to let you know
			that Ms. Harris is behind bars. We found out some interesting things about her. Is Sydney
			with you?" Alex could hear the hopefulness in his voice.</p>

		<p>"Yeah she is hang on a sec." Alex covered the phone
			with her hand. "It looks like you have started another fan club. It's Officer Randy.
			I think he has a crush on you." Alex giggled.</p>

		<p>"Oh stop..." Sydney said as she grabbed the receiver
			from Alex. "Hello Officer Randy, how are you this morning?"</p>

		<p>"Doing well Sydney, how was the rest of your party?"</p>

		<p>"Well it kind of came to an abrupt halt. Gee I wonder
			why." She smiled. Alex could hear the laughter coming from the officer and rolled her
			eyes.</p>

		<p>"Well I just figured you guys would still be up so I wanted
			to tell you something about Ms. Harris."</p>

		<p>"Oh?" Sydney stopped Alex from kissing her neck; she wanted to hear this. Alex
			pretended to pout and motioned to Sydney that she was going downstairs to get some water.</p>

		<p>"Yes. It seems as though Ms. Harris was caught embezzling
			money from her father's company in California. He filed charges against her and I guess
			that's why she came here. There is a warrant for her arrest in LA. Her father cut her off
			completely so she has no money to speak of. I'll just assume that's where you come
			in." The officer assessed the situation.</p>

		<p>"Unfortunately. I was given quite a bit of money when my
			parents passed away. She knew of this information, so I would agree with your assumption
			on that. I think it went a little deeper than that, but it may have started out that way.
			I just hope she gets the help she needs." </p>

		<p>"Me too. She is a bit on the aggressive side."</p>

		<p>"Oh yes she is." Sydney agreed. "Was she working for her father at all? I
			am just wondering how she met up with Tracey."</p>

		<p>"Yes apparently, she was in fact looking to do something with Ms. Miller's company,
			but it was only after she found out her father had cut her off. She told one of the other
			officer's that she met up with Tracey and was looking to get revenge on her father's
			company. She discovered with Tracey that she had a connection to you. Small world
			eh?" The officer attempted at humor. </p>

		<p>"I guess." Sydney didn't find it amusing.</p>

		<p>"Anyway, that's all I know for now. I'm hoping to get her in for a psychiatric
			analysis tomorrow. We need to know if she is crazy or just dangerous, or both for that
			matter."</p>

		<p>"Yes indeed. Well Officer Randy, thank you for the call. We
			do appreciate it."</p>

		<p>"No problem Sydney, thanks for your cooperation and assistance tonight."</p>

		<p>"No problem. Take care now. If you find out anything else, please let us know."
			Sydney said as she bid farewell to the policeman.</p>

		<p>"Sure thing. Goodnight." </p>

		<p>"Nite."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex returned with water in hand and sat on the rocking chair
			facing the window. She took a couple sips of water and just stared out at the moon.
			"So how was the rest of the call?" She asked Sydney who was walking out of the
			bathroom.</p>

		<p>"They found out that Sharon was stealing from her father. He
			cut her off and that's when she found Tracey's company I guess. They had contacted them at
			one point to talk about a merger or some shit, and after her father cut her off she went
			to Tracey's company impersonating an employee."</p>

		<p>"Wow, so what was the deal with you? Why was she after you again?" Alex
			inquired.</p>

		<p>"Just as I thought, she was after my money. She knew what I
			was worth after my folks passed away and she wanted it back. Her father cut her off so she
			went to the next best place she could think of; me. She just got lucky by meeting Tracey
			who happened to be your best friend. I don't think she expected the resistance she got
			either. God, she is really a sick individual."</p>

		<p>"God, that gives me the creeps." Alex said while shivering in her birthday suit.</p>

		<p>"Hey stand up for a second. I wanna do something."
			Sydney said as she gathered a blanket from off the bed. She sat down on the rocking chair
			and opened her arms for Alex. Sydney cradled her like a mother would a child. Sydney
			draped the blanket over their naked forms. Alex's head rested on her shoulder as she
			tenderly held the rest of her body close to her own. The two women just sat holding each
			other close as the rocking soothed any pain they may have felt earlier.</p>

		<p>"God this is nice. I love feeling your arms around me."
			Alex hummed to her lover.</p>

		<p>"Me too baby. I wish we could stay like this forever. Away
			from crazies like Sharon."</p>

		<p>"Mmm, me too." She agreed as she yawned quietly.
			"Sydney?"</p>

		<p>"Yes sweetheart?" </p>

		<p>"Thanks for my birthday party. Although Sharon may have
			ruined lots of it, it was still pretty cool. I don't think I will ever have that kind of
			excitement again."</p>

		<p>"God I hope not. I have dealt with more than my share of that kind of
			excitement."</p>

		<p>"You should see the kitchen Sydney. It is trashed. There are
			still some stains on the floor that Eddi and I couldn't get out. I'm just glad we got all
			the glass up." Alex sighed. "Man, what a night."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, when all of this is over and your house is sold, just
			think of the peace and quiet we will be able to have together."</p>

		<p>"Mm, I can't wait. God, I can't wait to get back to Montana. I really hate leaving
			Tracey here by herself after all of this, but...she's a big girl, I know she'll be all
			right." Alex's voice became nothing more than a whisper. Soon Sydney heard quiet
			snoring coming out of her love. She smiled into Alex's hair and gently kissed the top of
			her head. She tightened her hold on Alex and looked out the window and stared into the
			night's sky.</p>

		<p>"You were right Billy. There really is no love greater than
			the one you have for your family. Alex and Timmy are my family now, and I will do
			everything that I can to protect them. It was a hard lesson for me to learn, but I think I
			finally understood what you were trying to teach me. I miss you Billy, but I know that you
			would be proud of the woman I am today. This little one in my arms is living proof of
			that."</p>

		<p>A shooting star shot across the clear sky as Sydney finished her conversation with her
			brother. She smiled at his response and gently rocked her precious cargo until she too,
			fell captive to the night.</p>
