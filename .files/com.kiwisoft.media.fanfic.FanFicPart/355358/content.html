<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Mail Call -->

<p>Sam opened the mailbox and pulled out several envelopes for
both her and Brooke. She knew what most of them were, either acceptance letters
or rejection letters from the colleges they'd applied to. They'd been filtering
in for the past few weeks. She looked at the addresses and saw that they both
received responses from U. of Southern Cal. She set Brooke's down on the counter
and opened her own. Joy filled her as she read the school's letter welcoming her
to the freshman class. She whooped and jumped around the kitchen. </p>
<p>"Win Publisher's Clearinghouse?" Brooke asked as she walked in
on Sam's amusing display. Sam rushed over and grabbed Brooke in a bear hug and
swung her around. </p>
<p>"I got it! I got in!" she yelled happily as she twirled Brooke
in her arms. Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"Where?" she managed. </p>
<p>"USC! I got what I wanted!" Sam answered. Brooke smiled
brightly at her, genuinely happy. </p>
<p>"That's terrific Sammy! I'm so happy for you! Can you put me
down now? I'm getting kind of dizzy." Sam set her down but continued to dance
around the kitchen. Brooke laughed at her and then spied her own mail on the
counter. She quietly opened the USC envelope, read the letter and smiled. Sam
stopped her happy dance and looked at her. </p>
<p>"What?" she asked. Brooke focused her grin on Sam. </p>
<p>"I got in too," was all Brooke said before Sam started
swinging her around again. </p>
<p>"That's great!" Sam said with a wide smile before her face
turned serious. "But you don't have to go there." Brooke rolled her eyes.
</p>
<p>"I know, but they have a good teaching program and I've really
been thinking about that lately. I've always thought that I'd make a good
teacher." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"I think you would," she agreed. She hugged Brooke again.
"God, I am so happy!" Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"That's obvious, Sammy," she joked. "I have good news of my
own. Guess who's currently in first place in our class?" Sam's eyebrows shot up. </p>
<p>"You?" she asked. Brooke nodded proudly. </p>
<p>"Me," she informed Sam. Sam hugged and kissed her. </p>
<p>"Congratulations, Princess, I know you've been working hard
for that," she said. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"I have and after all the crap we've both been through, it's a
nice validation." </p>
<p>"You didn't get Prom Queen but you get Class Valedictorian.
And you earned it, it wasn't a popularity contest, good for you, love." Brooke
blushed. </p>
<p>"Where are you in class ranking?" she asked. Sam suddenly
looked away and decided that the fridge held the wonders of the universe.
</p>
<p>"Hungry?" she questioned Brooke. "Cuz I can make you an
omelete." </p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke said in a warning tone. </p>
<p>If you don't want eggs I could make pancakes or tacos."
</p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke said again. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"If I pass all my finals with B's or better, 12th," she said.
Two spots away from an honors diploma. Brooke sighed, Sam had been trying so
hard but because of the time and work she'd missed after the accident last year,
she never really caught all the way up. Still, 12th wasn't bad. She wrapped her
arms around Sam's waist in a comforting hug. </p>
<p>"I know you wanted better, Sammy but 12th is fantastic.
Especially for someone who a year ago was lying in a coma and we weren't even
sure was going to survive. And don't forget that there are almost 110 other
people who would love to be you right now." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, and 11 who are glad that they're not," she scoffed.
Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Little Miss Glass Half Empty," she chided. She felt Sam
chuckle. </p>
<p>"That's me," Sam agreed. She turned around in Brooke's arms so
that they were face to face. "You still love me right?" Brooke pretended to
think about that for a minute. </p>
<p>"Of course I do," she answered a few seconds later. "If you
keep asking dumb questions like that, I'm not surprised you came in 12th." Sam
mock glared at her. </p>
<p>"Keep that up and see who sleeps alone tonight," she
threatened. </p>
<p>"Eep!" </p>
