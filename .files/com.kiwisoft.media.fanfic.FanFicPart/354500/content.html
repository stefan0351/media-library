<!-- Legend \ Chapter 12: The Unfolding Path -->

<p>“I stood in in the presence of the Goddess,
Why have I been brought here I asked
The time has come for you to awaken my child
replied the Goddess
Awaken, I don’t understand I said
The chosen one is in need of a champion to protect
her and fight beside her said the goddess
But I am only one and my power is not that great I
said
I will give you three gifts to aid you said the
goddess</p>

<p>I give you the fires of love
With it you will destroy those who would harm your
beloved
With it you and the chosen one will protect all of my
children</p>

<p>I give you the power of the healing touch
So that you can ease the pain and suffering of not
only your beloved
but all who need it</p>

<p>I unlock your minds eyes
with it the magic that is within will grow beyond
your hopes and dreams</p>

<p>How do I use these gifts I asked
I will give you the knowledge for the first two said
the Goddess
And what of the third I said
A teacher will come replied the Goddess”</p>

<p>Giles and Collin along with the other two watchers and
Megan were astonished by what Willow had said. All of
their adult lives they had studied ancient prophecies
and lore, as they trained to guide the slayers in the
battle against the Hellsmouths, but as the redheaded
Wiccan spoke they saw all of that that changing. The
Goddess had altered everything they knew and
understood when she had taken Willow into the Forever,
they were now uncertain if they still had a role to
play in the struggle against the forces of the
Hellsmouths.</p>

<p>Angel awoke and found himself laying on a cot in what
appeared to be an abandoned warehouse, he slowly sat
up and looked around only to find that he was very
much alone in a very bizarre place. Candles were
burning all around the large empty room, there was
another cot off in the corner to his left with a small
wooden box next to it that was being used as a night
stand. In the middle of the room a circle was drawn
on the floor with symbols representing the elements of
magic drawn all around it. In the center of the
circle a lone white candle burnt. Each of the wall in
the rather large room had the same symbol drawn on
them, it was a triangle with a circle inside it, and
two vertical lines ran parallel through the center of
circle. He slowly got to feet and began to walk
around, suddenly the brooding vamp stopped in shock as
he realized that his body no longer hurt. Angel
looked down to see that not only were all his wounds
healed but everything was were it was suppose to be,
all the damage Vlad Tepes had done was somehow now
erased, some how the mysterious man who had rescued
him had also restored him. </p>

<p>Xander laid in his bed as the pain killers from the IV
flowed through his body, he heard the door open and
looked up to see Anya standing there smiling with
Buffy and Willow. His life long friend walked over to
his bed and placed her hand above his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry Xander, everything is going to be fine,”
said Willow as her hand began to emanate a golden glow
that seemed to spread out accrosed his body.

Vlad paced back in forth through the main area that
had once been the initiatives headquarters. Just a
few short days ago he had been at the top of the world
and could feel his plan coming into place, but that
witch and her slayer lover had ended all of it for
him. He howled out in rage at what the two girls had
done as he brought his powerful fist down on top of a
metal table breaking it half, “I will have my
revenge!” screamed the master vampyre.</p>

<p>The group walked out of the trauma center and headed
towards the two cars that were waiting for them, both
Tristin and Xander were amazed at what had just
happened. Both of them had been excepting a long
recovery from what the doctors were saying, but
somehow Willow had done in a matter of a half hour
what should have taken months, they both looked over
at the redhead in awe. Willow leaned up against Buffy
for support as the slayer helped her weaken lover to
Giles car. Xander wasn’t exactly sure what it was or
how willow had done it but he knew that whatever she
had used to heal him and the slayer in training had
weakened his friend.</p>

<p>Angel sat own his cot wondering what was going on, he
turned his head when the door to the room opened and
the young man who had rescued him walked in. This man
who called himself Eamonn was now dressed very
differently than he had been last night. Instead of
the black suite he had been wearing, the man now wore
only a simple brown robe as he walked over to Angel.</p>

<p>“Good, I see you are awake.” stated Eamonn.</p>

<p>Angel looked at this mysterious man, “I owe you a
great debt but who are you”</p>

<p>“As I told you last night, I am Eamonn.”</p>

<p>A bewildered look crept accrosed Angel’s face, He had
always thought the Powers that be were vague but this
guy seemed to be trying to out do them in that
department, “That's not what I ment”</p>

<p>“I know, but now is not the time. I have yet to
reveal myself to those who had been called.” replied
Eamonn as he handed Angel several packets of blood
that he had acquired from the local hospital, “Eat
now, then rest. Tonight you are to return to your
friends.”</p>

<p>After talking with Collin, Giles had went and rented
several other rooms so everybody could have there
privacy, with the understanding that once the sun went
down everyone not on patrol would have to go and stay
in the same room till sunrise. Buffy and Willow of
course had the room he had gotten them the night
before, but now each of the girls mothers had their
own room, Xander and Anya had their own room which
they had rushed to as soon as Giles handed Anya the
key, and everyone else also got a room of their own.
Fortunately with the events of the last few weeks the
hotel was fairly vacant and he had been able to get
all the rooms on the same floor. </p>

<p>Giles sat by himself wondering what was happening.
First Vlad Tepes had come and threw their lives into
so much turmoil, they could no longer even keep a
normal sleeping pattern, they would stay awake all
night and get a few ours of sleep in the morning and
early afternoon before getting up and preparing for
another night. And now the Goddess had taken matters
into her divine hand and his world once again had
changed, &lt;If this keeps up I don‘t know what I am
going to do, is it even possible for things change
anymore.&gt;</p>

<p>The group had armed up and was preparing to head out
on patrol when there was a knock at the door. Giles
and Collin pointed their crossbows at the door as the
slayer slowly opened it, everyone's jaws about hit the
ground as Buffy opened the door all the way, in the
hallway stood Angel.</p>

<p>“May I come in,” asked the brooding vamp</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied a very curious and confused Slayer.</p>

<p>Cordelia stood there for a moment as she looked at her
friend, all his wounds were gone and he looked exactly
like he had when they had first arrived in Sunnydale.
A tear rolled down her face as she ran over to the
brooding vamp and gave him a big hug. Giles watched
as Cordelia hugged Angel, he let out a sigh &lt;Here we
go again.&gt;</p>

<p>Angel after a few moments broke off the hug and looked
at the group, “we have to talk before anyone goes
out.”</p>

<p>“About what,” A reluctant Giles asked, knowing that
some how Angel was about to change everything even
more.

“Vlad Tepes for one. But more importantly a man
calling himself Eamonn.” </p>

<p>The police cruiser stopped short of hitting the figure
that was standing in the middle of the road, the two
officers carefully got out and began to approach the
young man. As they did they felt their minds begin to
fog, “Welcome to the new order of things,” Vlad said
as Spike grabbed one of the men from behind. The
other officer spun around to help his partner only to
have Vlad’s fangs sink quickly into his neck.</p>

<p>Angel had taken point on the patrol, he was followed
by Xander then Buffy and Willow. Giles was off to the
girls right and Archer was to their left, with Kathryn
and Tristin bring up the rear. Giles had to almost
laugh to himself at this formation they were walking
in. Buffy had formulated it in order to better
protect Willow during the patrol, but after last night
he was certain that of everyone out here Willow
probably needed the least protection. He had thought
about mentioning it to Buffy and suggesting that they
spread out a little more, but he didn’t. He had
learned anything since Willows return, it was when it
came to the redhead Buffy was extremely protective and
there wasn't anyone who could win an argument with the
slayer over Willows safety, including Willow.</p>

<p>Vlad and Spike walked down the darken streets towards
the local homeless shelter. The master vampyre had
decided that the best place to find recruits for his
army without alerting the witch and slayer to what he
was doing was to take those who would be least missed.
What better place was there in this town than the
shelter, everyone there had been forgotten by the
outside world, they had no friends or family that
would miss them, and the good people of Sunnydale in
an effort to ease their hearts had grouped them all
together out of site from the rest of the town, it was
practically a all you can eat buffet for his kind.</p>

<p>The group came up on a police cruiser stopped in the
middle of the road, but there were no cops to be
found. They knew that something was very wrong, first
after two hours of patrol not a single vampire could
be found and now this. The engine on the cruiser was
still running but it looked as if it had been
abandoned. Buffy turned to Giles, “What is gong on
here. For the last couple of nights it has been all
about death and destruction for Vlad, but now nothing
seems to be going on.”</p>

<p>Angel looked at the rest of them as Buffy’s words sunk
in, they could all see the look of dread the seemed to
take over his face. Buffy looked at the brooding
vamp, “You know something, what is it”</p>

<p>Angel took a second to pull it together then spoke, “I
learned a few things as Vlad Tepes tortured me and I
listened to him plot. He is not like most vampires,
not only is he extremely powerful he is also highly
intelligent. Even when he is in a total rage, he is
aware of what he is doing. If there is nothing going
on I believe it could mean only one of two things.
Either he is plotting something, or he wishes us not
to know what he is doing, so he is being careful
ensuring that he conceals it from us.”</p>

<p>Buffy then turned to Giles, “He‘s right, the last time
it was quite like this was right before he hit us and
burned your house down,” Buffy let go of Willows hand
and wrapped her arms tightly around her beloved
recalling how that attack almost had taken Willow away
from her. “I think it’s time we check out the
mansion”</p>

<p>“Buffy, I don’t know if that is the smartest thing to
do,” replied Giles.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at him as she held on to Willow, “It’s
either that or wait for him to figure out how to take
us all out, your call”</p>

<p>Giles pondered Buffy’s statement then spoke, “The
mansion it is.”</p>

<p>A large moving van, with its lifeless owner lying in
the back, sat in front of the homeless shelter. There
was no sign of life anywhere around the shelter. The
only ones that were moving had been dead for a long
time, and were quickly tossing their victims cold
bodies into the back of the truck. As they tossed the
last couple of bodies into the truck Vlad looked at
Spike then into the back of the van, &lt;When you awaken
my children a new order will begin.&gt;</p>

<p>The rest of the group nervously sat in the crowed
hotel room, listening to the nearly silent police
scanner. It appeared that the only thing going on was
that a couple of Sunnydales finest had disappeared but
besides that the night seemed to be quite. </p>

<p>Anya sat alone trying to figure out why Xander had
decide to go out on patrol. She had just gotten him
beck from the hospital and now he was out there once
again risking everything, but why. Xander had told
her that he owed it to them after all Willow had
healed him. She had begged her boyfriend to stay with
her, but had lost the argument, so now all she could
do was wait with the others and hope that he made it
back safely.</p>

<p>On the other side of the room Cordelia was lost in
similar thoughts about Angel. She had felt so alone
when he had vanished and she had been afraid of losing
her best friend. When she had learned of what he was
going through it had torn her apart, then earlier
tonight when he walked through that door she felt her
inner agony go away. She knew that they had become
close, and that she cared for him but now she found
herself questioning her feelings, trying to figure out
what was gong on inside her, &lt;Do I love Him.&gt;</p>

<p>The patrol stood in the empty mansion, there was no
sign of vampiric activity any were. Only the holes in
the wall and smashed up furniture gave a hint that
anyone had been there. All of the master vampyre’s
torturing devices were gone, only a series of smashed
up metal cages were left behind. Written in blood on
the wall where Angel had been held prisoner was the
words ‘You can not escape my wrath, you might have one
a battle but the war will be mine. Soon all shall
perish. Vlad.’ </p>

<p>As the group departed the mansion and headed back to
the hotel they were staying Eamonn walked out from the
bushes he had been watching them from and headed into
the mansion. He looked around and saw what Vlad had
written. He spoke out loud to himself, “What are you
up to?” Eamonn then turned from the wall and headed
for the door, he had so much to prepare, the time for
him to reveal himself was almost at hand.</p>

<p>Vlad looked out accrosed the room as he waited for his
new children to rise, “Soon William we will have our
revenge. Tomorrow I will send out some of my children
to keep the slayer and witch busy so that we can
finish my army in peace.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master,” replied the blond vampire.</p>

<p>“Then I will deal with the slayer and witch, her
friends are now yours to do with as you see fit.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I won’t let disappoint you,” Replied Spike
as he began to wonder which one of them would go
first.</p>

<p>“I know William, I know,” replied Vlad as he walked
over to where he and Spike had laid out his newly
found children, &lt;The will not escape me this time&gt;</p>
