<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Prologue -->

<P><i>1615, Oxford, England</i></P>

<P>She was a slight figure, short of stature, slender, her once long blond hair
hacked short like a new penitent, her gown ripped and torn by rough hands and
the lash. Her arms had been twisted behind her and folded over a heavy wooden
pike pole, her slender wrists chained together in front. Strangely, the
heartrending sight softened no hearts amongst her captors. They understood the
need to make certain this one small girl could not resist her torments if they
were to have any hope at controlling her. Even bound and beaten, she faced them
proudly, standing gracefully in the center of the pit, the bars overhead casting
striped shadows across her slender frame. Despite her situation, pale green eyes
blazed with raw rage and she showed no sign of fearing their control over her
fate.</P>
<P>"You have been accused of betraying the Council, Slayer!" the
senior Watcher serving as magistrate over the proceedings charged, his voice
more than loud enough to be heard by the small crowd spread around the edges of
the pit. His heavy garb was ecclesiastical in appearance as befitted his
position within the ancient organization. The dark robes, trimmed in royal
purple and thick fur moved with his broad gestures, making him seem larger than
life.</P>
<P>The girl lunged forward, though there was nowhere for her to go. The pit and
chains binding her wrists were more than enough to contain any efforts she might
have made to escape. "I've betrayed no one!" she snarled. "It's
your precious Watcher who betrayed me!"</P>
<P>"Lying bitch!" a heavyset man standing near the judge screamed.
"She murdered Elizabeth! Tricked her--"</P>
<P>"LIAR!!" the girl screamed back. "I LOVED HER!!!"</P>
<P>"SILENCE!!!" the judge bellowed, then waved to the guards who stood
on the edges of the pit. "Judgment has been passed." The sound of
metal sliding on metal screamed through the caverns as metal barred doors were
pulled up, opening the corridors to the cells hidden deep inside the caverns.
"Your perversity and your treason <I>will</I> be punished!"</P>
<P>The vampires that began to flow from the newly opened corridors were half
starved, bony and thin, their faces warped by the desperate demons that lived
inside their dead flesh.</P>
<P>Had her situation not been so desperate, the girl might have felt some pity
for them. Even for the undead she'd shown an oddly soft heart, but as it was,
terror made her heart hammer in her chest as she saw doom careening toward her.
There were more than a dozen of the creatures all driven to a frenzy by
starvation.</P>
<P>She was a Slayer; inhumanly strong, unbelievably fast, trained to fight--and
to kill--and she used every skill beaten into her in the four years since she'd
learned of her perverse calling to the utmost of her ability. Of all her
captors, only one--a guard only a year or two older than her twenty years--had
done her even the smallest of favors. The pole used to brace her arms back was
wood and not steel and she wielded the makeshift weapon with a skill borne of
desperation.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, her abilities weren't likely to save her. Only God could do
that--at least that was the idea of the trial by combat--and even he would have
been hard pressed to rescue the desperately battling young woman.</P>
<P>Overhead, gasps could be heard amongst the assembled crowd, along with the
odd sound of a bet being made. The odds were not in the prisoner's favor,
especially when she was momentarily overwhelmed by the thick--but
thinning--horde of her attackers.</P>
<P>But as they watched, more than a few council members could almost believe
that God<I> had</I> smiled on this Slayer. Despite being chained, outnumbered,
and beaten bloody, she fought like a lion, killing creature after creature as
they came after her, using her skills, and the clumsy weapon to dispatch them
back to hell.</P>
<P>Clouds of inhuman dust rose from the battle, obscuring their view and the
audience leaned farther forward in their seats, peering through the bars, trying
to find the slight figure of the young Slayer through the haze of vampire dust
with only flickering torchlight to aid them. Screams echoed across the hall and
more bets were made, the odds shifting with every passing moment.</P>
<P>And then it all fell silent.</P>
<P>Breaths caught and the sound of voices died away, until the only remaining
noise was the occasional jingle of coins being readied to trade hands.</P>
<P>Thick vampire dust slowly settled, the torches casting unsteady light through
the hanging haze, until finally a silhouetted figure could be seen.</P>
<P>A collective gasp went through the audience of Watchers as their victim was
revealed to their avid eyes.</P>
<P>The Slayer stood alone, her head bowed as blood streamed from a dozen small
wounds. Her wrists were slick with crimson, and as they watched, she slowly
worked one free of a manacle, drawing more blood and scraping the flesh of her
already battered hand. The chain fell away with a startling clank, but she only
lifted her arm from its braced position where it had been wrapped around the
pole, then slowly straightened it, working tortured fingers with careful
precision.</P>
<P>From his place on the mezzanine, the magistrate gestured to the guards
positioned around the pit and crossbows were raised, the bolts sighted on the
slender figure below.</P>
<P>If she was aware of this latest form of stalking death, she showed no outward
sign.</P>
<P>The members of the Watcher's Council all stared at the girl in mesmerized
awe, hardly able to believe that the doomed Slayer had survived. Scarcely a one
of them could even draw breath as they watched their prisoner pull the pole
across her back free and drop it to the dirt before methodically beginning the
process of removing the remaining manacle.</P>
<P>No one knew quite how to respond when she began to sing, the sweet sounds of
a madrigal--a sad tale of lost love--slipping from her lips to float up through
the chamber.</P>
<P>"She's mad," someone murmured somewhere in the crowd, and more than
a few who overheard the comment nodded in agreement. Not surprising, really,
considering what she'd been through. It would be a sad loss, they all agreed,
but not unpredictable. Unfortunate as it was, she would have to be dealt with.
The world could not do without a Slayer. At least this way she could be buried
in consecrated ground.</P>
<P>And then her wrist slipped free of the rough-edged metal and the chains fell
to the dirt with only the faintest jingle as the links tumbled into each other.
For a long moment, she just stood there, her head still down. Of course, it was
a wonder she was still on her feet at all.</P>
<P>As if driven by the very silence and stillness of the girl, her former
Watcher suddenly lunged forward, his portly frame, ungraceful at the best of
times, trembling with uncontrolled rage and something else--fear. She had passed
the test. That possibility had never occurred to him. "Destroy her!"
he screamed, his voice threatening to crack with panic. After all, he had
brought the full weight of the Council's judgment down on her narrow shoulders,
and it was no secret that an angry Slayer was a dangerous Slayer.</P>
<P>"Silence!" the Magistrate bellowed, still watching the girl with
intense eyes. "Tell the Council, child, have you been adjudged innocent of
the charges?"</P>
<P>She toed the wooden pole lying at her feet, flicking one end upward to catch
it easily. Still singing, her voice clear and sweet, she slowly began to roll it
between her fingers then over the back of her knuckles, her pace leisurely.</P>
<P>More voices mumbled about her obvious insanity.</P>
<P>And then pale green eyes lifted from under thick lashes and a smile lifted
full lips. Narrow shoulders shook with soft laughter, and then suddenly the
girl's chin slowly lifted, the song trailing off as she drew breath to respond.
"Not exactly," she drawled as the blood running down the graceful arch
of her throat was revealed to the watching crowd. In an instant, while her
audience was paralyzed with shock, she hurled the pole like a javelin, sending
it straight through the magistrate's heart in one fell swoop.</P>
<P>Crossbow bolts were fired, but none reached her heart as she plucked them out
of the air with fine boned hands and flung them back at the guards, easily
piercing the thin armored chestplates they wore and then the hearts beneath.</P>
<P>As panic reigned, she easily broke through the slatted wooden bars meant to
keep her in the pit. They were designed to contain vampire strength, or Slayer
strength, but not Vampire-Slayer strength.</P>
<P>And then the killing began in earnest....</P>
<P>The slaughter took no more than an hour as she moved through the caverns with
demonic precision, leaving the hand hewn walls and carved stone floors drenched
in blood and littered with body parts. She turned no one, instead tearing them
to pieces with a brutally efficient ferocity borne of both training and inherent
skill. The demon inside wanted nothing left of her earthly predecessor's
tormentors.</P>
<P>At last, she stood in the storage room where the remnants of her life had
been gathered and used as evidence against her during the trial, careless of the
dead left in her wake, physically sated, but.... She stood before the paintings
stacked against one wall, reached out, touched the top one, pulled it forward to
study the ones behind it one at a time, and finally curved fine boned fingers to
the entire stack. As she left the storage room, the paintings in hand, she
spared a glance for her former Watcher where he hung impaled on the spikes of a
large free-standing candelabra. His screams had provided the soundtrack for much
of her killing spree, though he'd finally fallen silent. She paused when she
stood before him, eyeing his florid, blood spattered face. "Poor
Freddy," she drawled and reached out to trail a finger through the crimson
streamers on his face. "Your nasty little bit of revenge didn't quite work
out the way you planned, now did it." She tasted the blood on her fingertip
and made a face. "You really should have cut back on the alcohol my
friend." Then, laughing, she turned from her former tormentor and walked
away into the night.</P>
