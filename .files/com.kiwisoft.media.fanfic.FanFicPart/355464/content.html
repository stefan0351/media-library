<!-- Mixed Messages \ Chapter 6: How many times can you be busted in one morning?!? -->

<p>"Well, it's like this, Mom," Sam began. </p>

<p>"No, let me," interrupted Brooke. "Jane, I'm in love with your
daughter. She, to my great surprise and joy, feels the same way about
me. We are an item, as of last night. Is this going to be a problem?"</p>

<p>Sam and Jane stared at her, dumbstruck. Sam had had no idea she would
blurt it out like that. Frankly, neither had Jane. Opening and
closing her mouth, but hearing no sound come out, she looked to Sam.
She trusted her daughter, and whatever she said would set the tone
for her entire response. </p>

<p>"Mom, I love you, and I want very much for you to accept this. If
you're not okay with it, then I don't think I can be happy. And at
the moment, mom, I am really happy. More than I've been in a long
time. I think Brooke is really going to make me feel happier than I
ever could on my own. She already is."</p>

<p>Finally, Jane found her voice. "Sam, you know I love you and I'll
support you in anything you want to do," she began. Sam and Brooke
had a sinking feeling there was going to be a `but'. </p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>Yep, there it went. </p>

<p>"But this is a lot to throw on a person first thing in the morning.
I'm going to use your time at school to think about it, okay? And
when you get home I'll tell you whether I'm okay with it, or whether
Sam and I need to move to Alaska. Does that sound all right?"</p>

<p>To Sam and Brooke, this was not a no. That meant it was okay with
them. Both hugging her, they bounded out the door and to school. The
ride was normal as ever, except maybe for Sam's hand taking up semi-
permanent residence on Brooke's thigh. All in all, they made it to
school in one piece, and even ten minutes before first bell, so they
looked around for a place to make out. </p>

<p>The Novac was suggested and just as quickly disregarded, as it was
the stomping ground of Nicole and her cronies for much of the school
day. It would just not do to be caught by them, not at this stage in
their relationship. A list of locations ran through both of their
heads, until Sam suggested the newspaper office, which was officially
closed until at lease third period. It took all of twenty seconds for
them to get there and barricade themselves in. Then they turned to
each other and...</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I've missed this," Brooke gasped in between frantic kisses. </p>

<p>"Missed this? We've only been together all morning! And the last time
we kissed was..."</p>

<p>"Too long ago," Brooke moaned, tracing the line of Sam's lips with
her tongue, begging for entrance. Sam gave up and let her in, both of
them gasping with the sheer pleasure of being in each other's arms.
Brooke's hands started to wander, but Sam stopped her. </p>

<p>"None of that, Brookie," she warned. "I'm like a can of Pringles.
Once you pop, you can't stop."</p>

<p>"Who says I want to stop?"</p>

<p>"Neither do I," panted Sam. But we've got to get to class, and if we
don't want everyone to know what we've been doing, we're going to
have to pay a visit to the Novac to clean ourselves up."</p>

<p>Pouting prettily, Brooke let her go. They straightened themselves up
the best they could, and then opened the door and headed for the
Novac. Meanwhile...</p>

<p>Mary Cherry stood a little way from the newspaper office, out of
sight of it. She was open mouthed, wide eyed, and web-toed (is that
even a word?), and she'd heard everything, including assorted moans.
Gathering what faculties she still had left (and her webbed toes) she
raced off to find Nicole. In `tahmes of need', Mary Cherry still
turned to the age old chain of command, which involved passing all
such information to their beloved leader and benefactor, Nicole
Julian. </p>

<p>"May Gahd have mercy on their souls," Mary Cherry murmured to
herself, rubbing her web-fingered hands together in glee. Did I
mention that Mary Cherry is inbred and web-toed (and fingered?!)</p>
