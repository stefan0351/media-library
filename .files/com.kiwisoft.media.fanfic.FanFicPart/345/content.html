<p>Brooke watched Sam and Josh
dancing and felt sick to her stomach. Jealousy was not a familiar feeling to
Brooke, she was the person people were jealous of. She didn't actively seek to
be this type of person, although Nicole assured her it was an enviable position,
but it seemed that her life was what people aspired to. A sardonic smile graced
her lips at this thought, if only they knew how imperfect her life was and how
many problems she had they might not be so keen to be just like her. The current
problem she was facing was the fact that she was jealous, not of Sam, but of
Josh.</p>
<p>She had broken up with Josh when she had finally admitted to
herself that she was attracted to Sam. Of course, this hadn't been the reason
she had given him and she certainly hadn't told anyone else of her infatuation.
Her friends weren't the most understanding or sympathetic people in the world.
Nicole would most likely have to be institutionalised if she ever found out that
Brooke had a crush on someone not of the `popular' crowd?and Sam of all
people. And telling Mary Cherry would be like placing a front-page ad in the
newspaper. So Brooke had chosen to keep this a secret.</p>
<p>She had asked Harrison to the Sadie Hawkins dance because he
was probably the nearest she could get to Sam and still be male. Unfortunately
he hadn't turned out to be quite what she'd hoped. She glanced over at him. He
moved in a manner reminiscent of Frankenstein's Monster due to an excess of
working out. She sighed out loud and turned back to the dance floor, feeling a
stab of pain as she saw Sam smile up at Josh and reply to whatever he had said.
Maybe she should just have stayed home, saved herself the torture of knowing
that Sam and Josh were having a blast and would probably end up going out with
each other - something Brooke didn't think she could handle witnessing first
hand. She imagined walking into her living room and finding them curled up on
the sofa watching videos, whispering, kissing. Her eyes stung with tears and she
quickly looked down. Harrison caught the look and felt compelled to say
something.</p>
<p>"You haven't stopped watching them all night. He'd take
you back in a second if you asked him." Harrison thought he was being
chivalrous by stepping down but the look Brooke shot at him confused him quite a
lot.</p>
<p>"I don't want him back Harrison, if I did I would have
asked him to the dance."</p>
<p>"So why?"</p>
<p>"Just?just forget it, it's not important." It's
hopeless, Brooke thought as she turned back to the couple slow dancing on the
floor.</p>
<p><center>~*~*~*~</center></p>
<p>Josh blinked to clear his head which was starting to feel like
it was full of cotton candy. Who knew sweating could take so much out of a
person? He looked down at the girl dancing in his arms and smiled
conspiratorially.</p>
<p>"So, you think they know we're only doing this for
revenge purposes?" he asked.</p>
<p>Sam's smile faded.</p>
<p>"No, no. I think we got them fooled."</p>
<p>She laid her head on Josh's leather clad shoulder and closed
her eyes. Yep, she had everybody fooled. She almost had herself fooled. What
Josh didn't know was that their `revenge' was aimed at the same person, that
they were both in love with the same person. Sam had been quite content to go to
the dance with Harrison. It would have meant that there was no silly boy/girl
stuff. She didn't think of him as a boy, he was Harrison. Going with her best
friend meant that she didn't have to fake something she didn't feel. The only
person she felt anything for was Brooke and that was just out of the question.
Once or twice she had caught Brooke staring at her and Josh. She would always
look away as Sam caught her eye, obviously embarrassed to have been observed
watching Josh whom she was supposedly `over'. A deep sense of longing pervaded
Sam's heart and she pulled Josh closer, trying to block out her feelings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately she'd forgotten about the inflatable underwear
she'd bought after Brooke's comment about her training bras. The increased
contact caused her bosoms to swell in a very noticeable manner. Josh looked at
her in wonder as she pulled away, then his eyes were drawn to her rapidly
expanding cleavage.</p>
<p>"You eat something you're allergic to?" Josh Ford:
Mr Sensitivity.</p>
<p>Sam attempted to cover her growing assets with her hand and
tried desperately to think of something to say. But when an audible pop
signalled the demise of her recently purchased undergarment she admitted defeat
and ran off in the direction of the Novak, unsuccessfully trying to hold back
her tears.</p>
<p><center>~*~*~*~</center></p>
<p>Brooke watched the proceedings on the dance floor with
interest and concern. It looked like Josh had done something to Sam's chest and
then insulted her. Ignoring the weird looks she was getting from Harrison she
stood up and marched out to meet a very breathless Josh.</p>
<p>"What the hell did you do to her?" Brooke demanded.</p>
<p>"Me? I didn't do anything! Her boobs started doing
something funny then she ran away."</p>
<p>Josh brought a hand up to wipe the sweat from his brow and
leaned down, hands on his thighs, trying to get his breath back. Brooke looked
at the stooped figure and decided that he really was clueless about what had
happened. She turned on her heel and headed off in the direction Sam had taken.
On her way she passed a very bedraggled looking Nicole, Mary Cherry and Poppy.
She offered them a brief wave, noticing that they all appeared to be walking
rather gingerly and continued on her way.</p>
<p><center>~*~*~*~</center></p>
<p>When she reached the door of the Novak she stopped and took a
deep breath before opening it and entering. Sam was nowhere to be seen. Brooke
walked a little further into the room before she heard the distinct sound of
crying coming from one of the stalls. She approached the locked cubicle and
knocked gently on the door.</p>
<p>"Sam?" she called softly.</p>
<p>"Go away."</p>
<p>"Sam what's wrong? Are you OK, you looked upset."</p>
<p>"I'm fine?*sniff*?just?just go back to your date,
I'll be OK."</p>
<p>Brooke sighed and leaned her forehead against the cool surface
of the stall door.</p>
<p>"Sam, something obviously happened out there and you
looked anything but fine when you ran out of the hall." She smiled.
"And my date really is kinda incapacitated tonight so I'd much prefer to be
in here with you than out there with him."</p>
<p>She heard a short mixture of a laugh and a hiccup.</p>
<p>"Yeah, he is a bit rigid huh?"</p>
<p>"Just goes to show what people will do to be thought of
as attractive."</p>
<p>Another laugh erupted, a bitter, regretful sound.</p>
<p>"Sam? Are you gonna let me in or do I have to stand here
talking to this door all night?"</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"Speaking of things people do to be attractive?"</p>
<p>Then the door opened to reveal a very tear stained Sam. Brooke
automatically reached out and squeezed her shoulder in a gesture of comfort. It
wasn't quite how she wanted to comfort Sam but it would do. Then the cause of
Sam's distress became apparent to her. One of her breasts was bulging out of her
dress almost whereas the other one seemed to have?burst? Brooke shook her head
sadly.</p>
<p>"Go ahead, laugh at what an idiot I am." Sam said,
waiting for a biting comment.</p>
<p>"You're not an idiot Sam." Brooke said seriously,
looking into Sam's eyes as she spoke.</p>
<p>"No?" Sam was a little taken aback by the response.
"What would you call it then?"</p>
<p>"It's like Lily says, we're all forced to live up to
images of beauty and attractiveness that we'll never achieve."</p>
<p>Brooke pushed a few strands of Sam's hair behind her ear, not
noticing the way that Sam leaned into the contact.</p>
<p>"You are so beautiful in so many ways Sam?it's just
really sad that you feel that you need to change yourself for someone to like
you."</p>
<p>"You?you think I'm beautiful?" Sam whispered.</p>
<p>"I'd have to be blind not to think you're beautiful
Sam?don't you know that?"</p>
<p>Brooke was genuinely surprised at Sam's lack of
self-confidence. Sam projected such an image of not caring what people though of
her and not judging people on looks that it hadn't occurred to Brooke that she
might worried about her own appearance. Brooke took Sam's arm and pulled her out
of the stall and towards the mirror. She stood behind Sam and caught her eye in
the reflection.</p>
<p>"Look at yourself. People pay thousands of dollars to get
lips like yours?and I know people who would kill for those eyes. But it's not
even that Sam?it's you, it's your personality that really sets you apart. You
care about people, everybody knows that you try to make the world a better place
with your crusades and your journalism?even if you do piss people off
occasionally."</p>
<p>They shared a smile at this last comment.</p>
<p>"And that smile?well on the few occasions you've smiled
at me it's like I can feel a warmth inside me, just because of your smile?now
tell me, how can you think you're not beautiful."</p>
<p>Sam gazed at her reflection as if seeing it clearly for the
first time. She smiled at Brooke.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"I wasn't saying it to flatter you. I was only telling
you the truth."</p>
<p>Sam turned around and faced Brooke, highly aware of the
closeness of their bodies.</p>
<p>"Well, thank you anyway?nobody's ever really said stuff
like that to me before."</p>
<p>"That's probably because everybody thinks you don't
care." Brooke reasoned.</p>
<p>"True?and I'm not totally obsessed with my looks or
anything?I just wanted to look nice tonight?"</p>
<p>"Well, I hope Josh appreciates you."</p>
<p>Sam looked down at the floor and sighed.</p>
<p>"OK, confession time?you were right, I'm not attracted
to Josh, I only asked him because I was mad at you for going with
Harrison."</p>
<p>Brooke leaned back against the ledge in front of the mirror
beside Sam.</p>
<p>"Well?I'm not actually interested in Harrison in that
way?he was?I? I'm not sure what I was thinking of when I asked him
anymore."</p>
<p>Sam stole a sideways glance at Brooke.</p>
<p>"So?are you going to get back with Josh?" she
asked in what she hoped was a detached tone.</p>
<p>"What? Josh? No." Brooke hadn't expected that
question. It was funny, when you know something it's easy to forget that other
people aren't thinking in the same way as yourself.</p>
<p>"Oh?really? It's just?I saw you looking at him
tonight when we were dancing and I just thought?"</p>
<p>Sam's voice trailed off in confusion. If Brooke wasn't
attracted to Harrison and she didn't want Josh back?Sam didn't know what she
was thinking. Brooke looked like she wanted to say something. After the kindness
she had shown Sam earlier, Sam felt it was only right to return the favour, even
if it meant hearing about some new love interest of Brooke's.</p>
<p>"So?you want to talk about it?"</p>
<p>"Talk about what?"</p>
<p>"Whatever's on your mind?and by the looks of things, on
the tip of your tongue."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled.</p>
<p>"Believe me, you wouldn't want to know."</p>
<p>"Try me?I know it might be hard for you to believe, but
I'm a pretty good listener."</p>
<p>"I don't doubt that?it's just?this is?forget it, it
doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"It evidently does matter?Brooke, talk to me?isn't
that what sisters do?" Sam grinned.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. Bringing up the `sisters' issue merely
complicated matters further. She shook her head and looked at Sam's face. She
looked so understanding and ready to listen that Brooke couldn't leave her
hanging.</p>
<p>"Uh?OK, I?I kind of have a crush on?someone?and
I'm pretty sure that they don't feel the same way about me."</p>
<p>"Are you kidding me? Brooke, I saw how many applications
for dates you got for this dance?any guy in the school would walk over hot
coals just to spend three minutes in your company?."</p>
<p>"But what if it's not a guy?"</p>
<p>The whispered interruption had escaped before Brooke could
stop it. And now she would have done anything to take it back. She was terrified
to look at Sam. She really didn't want to see the reaction her little outburst
had provoked. If she had chosen to look at Sam she would have seen her run a
gamut of emotions. There was the initial shock of hearing the words, a quick
stop at hope as she considered the possibility that Brooke had been referring to
her and finally resignation that Brooke had a crush on someone who probably
wasn't her. But she had to know for sure.</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm not telling you."</p>
<p>"Brooke, please, just tell me who it is."</p>
<p>Brooke suddenly became very fidgety and was concentrating on
avoiding Sam's gaze.</p>
<p>"Just forget I said anything?and don't put this in the
paper."</p>
<p>Sam stopped short, hurt by the fact that Brooke thought she
would take a private conversation and use it in the newspaper. Although there
was the cheating scandal thing?so she supposed Brooke had grounds for the
accusation. But Brooke was shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Sammy, I didn't mean that?I get bitchy when
I get upset? sort of a defence thing." She looked up at Sam for the first
time since her admission.</p>
<p>"It's OK, I've been known to do the same thing
myself."</p>
<p>Sam paused as Brooke looked back down at the floor. Suddenly
something inside her reached a decision; she began to speak having no idea where
the words were coming from as her brain wasn't really privy to the decision.</p>
<p>"Brooke, would it help if I told you the reason that I
was mad at you for going with Harrison was that?was that?was that I was mad
you weren't going with me?"</p>
<p>Sam finished the sentence in a rush. Her brain had just caught
up with her mouth and was now pumping adrenaline all over her body as pure fear
gripped her heart and squeezed. Brooke looked up as if in slow motion. Her mouth
was open in a classic expression of surprise.</p>
<p>"What did you say?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"I?uh?I said?ummm?the?God I can't
remember." Sam's whole body was shaking as she awaited Brooke's response.</p>
<p>"I mean, I heard what you said?I was just wondering if
it meant what I think it meant."</p>
<p>Sam nodded mutely. She felt numb?and a bit dizzy?and
slightly sick.</p>
<p>"I?I don't know what to say?"</p>
<p>Sam took this to be a negative response and quickly found her
voice.</p>
<p>"Oh look, hey?it's OK?I mean, I didn't really think
that you were talking about me earlier?I just?well I thought I'd kind
of?show solidarity and?"</p>
<p>Brooke stood and moved so she was standing in front of Sam.
She placed a gentle finger over Sam's lips to quiet her.</p>
<p>"Shhh, I was talking about you."</p>
<p>Sam's lips turned up in a smile under Brooke's finger.</p>
<p>"You were?" The words were slightly distorted by the
digit.</p>
<p>Brooke nodded, still unsure of how to proceed. How does one
behave when you find out unrequited love is actually?requited? She couldn't
think of a single thing to say that didn't sound incredibly corny. So she took
her finger away and leaned in and replaced it with her own lips.</p>
<p>Every nerve ending in Sam's body came alive as Brooke kissed
her. The sensations were totally new but it felt?familiar, comfortable, right.
Sam tentatively put her arms around Brooke's waist and pulled her in, deepening
the kiss and the contact between their bodies. When the kiss ended they pulled
apart and looked at each other bashfully.</p>
<p>"Well, that was?unexpected." said Sam, finally.</p>
<p>"Uh huh." Brooke agreed.</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a moment longer before leaning
in again for another kiss. This time when they separated they put some distance
between their bodies, needing to clear their heads.</p>
<p>"So?we uh?we should probably get back to the
dance." Brooke suggested.</p>
<p>"Yeah?yeah, they're probably wondering where we
are?we do have dates out there after all."</p>
<p>"Right, dates. We should go to them?but uh?you might
want to fix your bra first."</p>
<p>Sam looked down at herself. She had forgotten the reason she'd
came into the bathroom in the first place. It somehow didn't seem as disastrous
as it had earlier. She smiled at Brooke and went into a stall to adjust herself.
She came out holding the offending item of underwear and dumped it
unceremoniously in the trash can. She noticed Brooke staring at her.</p>
<p>"What? Does it look weird without a bra?"</p>
<p>"No. Not at all. I was just thinking that you look
amazing."</p>
<p>Sam blushed. She reached out and took Brooke's hand.</p>
<p>"Thank you?again." She glanced at the door.
"I wish I could dance with you out there."</p>
<p>"Me too?but I think that would cause more problems than
we want to deal with right now."</p>
<p>"Definitely?we'll talk more about this when we get
home." Sam agreed.</p>
<p>"And maybe we can have our own dance later on."
Brooke suggested.</p>
<p>"I'll look forward to it."</p>
<p>And with that they walked out of the bathroom together and
headed back to the hall. There they sat with their respective dates, talking and
laughing as if nothing had happened. No-one noticed the shy looks they exchanged
over the table. The Sadie Hawkins Dance may have been a disappointment for most
of the sophomore class at Kennedy High, but for two students at least it had
opened up a whole new and exciting future just waiting to be explored.</p>
