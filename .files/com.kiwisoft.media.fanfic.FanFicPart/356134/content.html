<!-- After Homecoming \ Part 4 -->

<p>It wasn't until
4th period English, when Cordelia finally saw Buffy the next day. Arriving
a couple of seconds late as usual, Buffy scanned the room for Cordelia,
finally spotting her in the far row at the back. Smiling at the sight of
an empty seat beside the girl, she quickly maneuvered her way across the
room.</p>

<p>"Hey." Buffy
breezed as she sat down and bent to open her book bag.</p>

<p>"Hi. I wasn't
sure I was going to see you today. Training with Giles this morning?" Cordelia
asked quietly.</p>

<p>Buffy rolled
her eyes and whispered, "Giles has decided that he's concerned about Mr.
Trick and his obsession for destroying Faith and I. We were in there this
morning and at lunch...just going through books and stuff."</p>

<p>Cordelia looked
worried, "There's not going to be another Slayer Fest thing, is there?"</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged,
"I don't think there's anything to worry about really, and hey, if it cuts
my patrolling hours in half, I'm all for it. Giles figures since the night's
been dead for the past couple of weeks, and some psycho is trying to off
all the slayers, that I don't need to be on patrol for very long at night.
That leaves more time to not do homework and hang out with my friends."
Buffy said grinning.</p>

<p>"That's coolness."
Cordelia agreed, before turning her attention to the teacher, who had just
begun the lesson.</p>

<p>When the bell
rang to end the class, Buffy and Cordelia made their way to the library
where the gang usually met up, especially if there was trouble. Willow,
Oz, Xander, and Faith were already there when they walked in. Everyone
seemed to have an assortment of books stacked in front of them at the huge
table, already starting the research for the night.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy. Cordelia."
Faith drawled in their direction.</p>

<p>"Hi Faith." Buffy
greeted, taking an empty seat next to Oz. "How come you didn't show at
the Bronze last night?"</p>

<p>Faith shrugged,
"Ah, y'know... just felt like watching TV. Besides, there's a short supply
of hot guys in this town... .it wouldn't have been that fun." She said,
glancing over in Giles'direction.</p>

<p>Cordelia sat
down next to Xander and looked at the books on the table as if they were
diseased. "I take it we're researching the night away once again."</p>

<p>"It seems that
we must figure out who this Mr. Trick is, and how he has so many connections
in the demon world." Giles said from behind her.</p>

<p>"That's a yes
then." Cordelia sighed. Looking across the table at Buffy, she straightened
up a bit. "But, I promise to actually read the books this time."</p>

<p>Giles turned
to look at Cordelia surprised, "That's... uh... wonderful Cordelia.
I'm sure... you can be a big help to us then."</p>

<p>Smiling, Cordelia
grabbed the nearest book at started reading.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Two hours and
three pizza's later, the gang was no closer to any kind of useful information
for their cause.</p>

<p>"You know, maybe
this guy is just too new for all of these books. Maybe that's why he's
hip with the new tech stuff?" Xander blurted out, frustrated.</p>

<p>"That may be
possible." Giles considered, "But we must be absolutely sure before we
rule out the texts."</p>

<p>"Of course."
Xander sighed.</p>

<p>Suddenly Buffy
stood up, and gathered her belongings. "I'm gonna go patrol for a while.
You guys don't need me around here for this."</p>

<p>"Well alright."
Giles agreed, "But have Faith go with you. In case Mr. Trick has anything
else planned."</p>

<p>Buffy smirked,
"Giles, Faith bailed out of here half an hour ago."</p>

<p>"She did?" Giles
asked, scanning the room.</p>

<p>"Uh huh."</p>

<p>"Oh. Well then
be careful. Just do a quick sweep, there's no sense in staying out later
than needed." Giles lectured.</p>

<p>"Aye-aye sir."
Buffy mocked, as she swung her bag onto her shoulder. "See you tomorrow
guys." She said to her friends. A chorus of good-byes followed her as she
left the library.</p>

<p>Heading for the
outskirts of town, Buffy mentally cursed to herself for forgetting to look
in on Angel. It had been over 4 days since she had last seen him, and she
hoped he was still getting better. Damn it. If he's gone off and hurt anyone,
or been hurt. No, Angel would stay there, wouldn't he? She reasoned.</p>

<p>Finally she approached
the place, and quickly went inside to find him. Entering the main area,
she saw the lit fireplace and blankets laying on the floor nearby.</p>

<p>"Buffy." Came
his voice from behind her.</p>

<p>Startled, Buffy
spun around, almost in attack stance. She saw he was standing partially
hidden by the curtain, only now stepping out as it was apparent there was
no danger.</p>

<p>"Angel. Jesus,
you scared me." Buffy said nervously.</p>

<p>Angel apologized,
"Sorry. Just had to make sure it wasn't someone else... "</p>

<p>"Are you alright?"
Buffy asked, concerned.</p>

<p>"I still feel
the pain, but it's better. Still a little shaky though." Angel confessed.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled.
"I'm glad that you're getting better. I've been worried."</p>

<p>Angel gave a
small smile in return, then turned away. "You must have been busy these
past couple of days, you haven't been around." He said quietly.</p>

<p>Buffy looked
down at the floor. "I'm really sorry. I... I guess I have been busy.
Homecoming ended up being a fight for my life. Some new vamp in town is
trying to kill Faith and I." Buffy explained, then added quickly, "But
of course he didn't, and will not succeed."</p>

<p>Angel turned
back toward Buffy. "Be careful Buffy."</p>

<p>"I will, I promise."</p>

<p>"How is everyone
else?"</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged.
"They're all good. Same old stuff."</p>

<p>"And Scott?"
Angel asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Apparently over."
Buffy said, surprised. She had almost forgotten the guy since last Thursday.</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry."</p>

<p>"No, it's alright.
We didn't really click anyway. He couldn't really deal with the life that
is me, so he wasn't worth it I guess."</p>

<p>"That's too bad.
He doesn't realize what he let go of." Angel said.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled.
"Thank you."</p>

<p>The two talked
for a while longer before Buffy had to leave. She promised to visit again
in the next couple of days.</p>

<p>As she lay in
bed that night, Buffy had a gauntlet of guilt and unanswered questions
running through her head. Why was she so hung up over Cordelia now? In
less than 5 days they had gone from mortal enemies to lusting after each
other. And Angel... how could she have left him for so long? Perhaps
she could have told him about her new feelings for Cordelia. Would he be
understanding? He was when she told him about Scott. He at least knows
Cordelia. Then again, he knows Cordelia.</p>

<p>Finally too exhausted
to think anymore, Buffy fell into a fitful sleep.</p>
