<p>"NAME-RANK-SERIAL NUMBER." Brooke blinked in confusion.</p>
<p>"Huh? Wha??" </p>
<p>"NAME-RANK-SERIAL NUMBER," the metallic, unfeeling voice repeated. She looked around the small dark room but saw no one else with her.</p>
<p>"Uhm, do you mean me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"NAME-RANK-SERIAL NUMBER!" it demanded again. Brooke jumped and swallowed convulsively.</p>
<p>"Uhm, Brooke McQueen?rank? I don't know. Senior, I guess?" she tried to respond.</p>
<p>"SERIAL NUMBER." Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"I don't understand. Would that be my social security number?" she wondered.</p>
<p>"SERIAL NUMBER," it repeated. Brooke threw her hands up, annoyed.</p>
<p>"I don't know what you mean. Serial number? What is that?" she was starting to panic.</p>
<p>"SERIAL NUMBER," it was single minded and insistent.</p>
<p>"I can't give you an answer if I don't understand!" she cried, exasperated. She reached up to run a hand through her hair and saw it. Nine numbers tattooed into her skin.</p>
<p>"736-11-3591?" she read out loud. "What is that?"</p>
<p>"YOUR SERIAL NUMBER," it stated mater-of-factly. "You are prisoner 736-11-3591."</p>
<p>"WHAT?" she screeched. "What do you mean `prisoner'? Where am I?"</p>
<p>"You are here. There is no escape. You will do as you are told until such time as you serve your sentence or you die. Whichever comes first," she was told flatly. Scared and in a panic, Brooke started to cry.</p>
<p>"Who are you? Why are you doing this to me?" she sobbed, sinking to her knees in despair.</p>
<p>"I am your father," Mike said, emerging from the shadows. He looked eerie, almost possessed fixing his cold stare on Brooke. His eyes, formerly blue seemed to glow a hazy red to her.</p>
<p>"I believe I told you that you had some lessons to learn," he said menacingly, advancing on Brooke slowly. "And school is in." He reached out to her and Brooke felt her blood run cold. There was no mistaking his intentions towards her.</p>
<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"</p>
<p align="center">~~~~~</p>
<p>Brooke bolted upright in her bed, temporarily confused. After a few minutes, she became aware of her surroundings and her thundering heart began to slow. She ran a trembling hand through her sweat dampened hair and realized that her entire body and therefore pajamas were also soaked with sweat. She looked at the clock and noticed that it was almost 6 anyway, so with a heavy sigh, she swung her legs over the side of the bed, grabbed some clean clothes and headed for the shower.</p>
<p>&lt;I can't take much more of this&gt; she thought as she adjusted the temperature of the water. &lt;This captivity is turning me into a freaking headcase&gt;</p>
<p>She stepped under the spray and tried to wash some of her uneasiness away. The water was hot, almost scalding and she liked the way it made her skin feel. Surpressing another shiver as she rethought her dream, she tried to think of something more pleasant. Her thoughts automatically drifted to Sam.</p>
<p>&lt;God, I miss you Sammy&gt; she thought with a sigh. She put her arms on the shower wall and rested her forehead against them as she thought.</p>
<p>&lt;I didn't know I could care for someone so much?love someone so much it actually hurt. I always thought that was just an expression. Now I know that it's not. I love her so much I can't imagine my life without her in it. And without her with me right now, it's unbearable&gt;</p>
<p>She turned off the water and stepped out to start drying.</p>
<p>&lt;I don't understand who my father's become. I don't even know him. I never know what to expect. What if my nightmare comes true? What am I going to do?&gt;</p>
<p>Cold fear gripped her for several seconds before she was able to regain control of her breathing. And in that moment, Brooke swore she'd kill her father before he EVER laid a hand on her like that. EVER.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily bounced with excitement as Nicole and Jane discussed closing details with the real estate broker in the next room. It wasn't that she wasn't interested, but she was so excited that she couldn't seem to sit still. SO instead she continued to tour what she hoped was going to be her and Nicole's new home.</p>
<p>It was a posh, roomy mansion in the most socially high-class area of Beverly Hills. It had gold faucets, red carpeted staircases, crystal chandeliers, the whole nine years. But it wasn't what attracted Lily and Nicole to it. They were attracted to the atrium on the first floor; the use of water and waterfalls throughout the house as a calming influence; the view outside overlooking the mountains; the hot tub and pool as well as the spacious yard were among the real drawing points.</p>
<p>Lily found herself again in the giant atrium, which was filled with all colors and species of plant life. The homes former owner was a botanist and all around plant enthusiast. Lily breathed deep, inhaling the aroma of the room, which was rich and heavenly. She loved it.</p>
<p>The house itself had a wonderful and lively history. It was built in the early 1900's by a carpenter as a gift to his wife and had stayed in the family until now. It had been built on and upgraded throughout the years, but never lost the original homey feel or the sense of love that went into building it. Only recently, the last member of the family, an elderly woman named Abigail had passed away peacefully in her sleep, leaving the house empty. Now it was a hot property on the market that Lily and Nicole were hoping to get.</p>
<p>"Meeeerrrow?" came from behind Lily making her jump. She turned to see a pair of yellow eyes watching her intently.</p>
<p>"Whoa, there little fella. You scared me," she said with a chuckle. She tried to get a better look at the cat, partially hidden by a fern but it shied away from her.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm not going to hurt you," she cooed softly trying to draw the cat out.</p>
<p>"Meerrrow?" One white paw batted playfully at Lily's hand as she moved branches of the plant out of the way.</p>
<p>"Come on out so I can see you," she coaxed. The cat, not much older than a mature kitten, tried to pounce on her hand. It jumped and blinked at her when she laughed.</p>
<p>"You're a very pretty girl," Lily told the black, orange, and white Calico who seemed to preen at the words. It walked out farther to let Lily pet her and after a few minutes, she let Lily pick her up and settled down in the Latina's arms purring.</p>
<p>"I see you've found Triscuit," Brent, the broker said as he approached with Nicole and Jane.</p>
<p>"Actually, she found me," Lily explained.</p>
<p>"Well, no one else has been able to catch her since Abby died, so we've just been leaving food out for her," Brent said. "Must be a sign." Lily arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"A sign? Of what?"</p>
<p>"That you were meant to have this house," Brent said with a smile. "Right, Nicole?" Lily's eyes got wide and she looked to Nicole.</p>
<p>"Is that right, Nikki?" she asked in a whisper. Nicole grinned.</p>
<p>"If you still want it, love. The house is ours. Lock, stock, and barrel," she said. Lily squealed in happiness and raced to embrace her love. The mewing protest of Triscuit separated them.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry, Triscuit," Lily sniffled. Nicole eyed the cat that was purring again and gently kneading Lily's chest.</p>
<p>"Hey, cat, back off. She's mine," Nicole warned.</p>

<p>Brooke hated mealtimes. All she really felt they were was a chance for Mike to sit and interrogate and/or harass her. There was no actual conversation taking place so much as a question and answer session. It wasn't all that great for her digestion. Spending ANY time with Mike turned her stomach really. He was so full of hatred and delusions that he frightened her at times.</p>
<p>"Pass the salt, please," Mike asked. Brooke silently complied. She found it better sometimes not to speak at all. It gave Mike nothing to work with. She returned to methodically chewing her food as Mike watched her.</p>
<p>"You're never going to speak to me again, are you?" he asked suddenly. Brooke frowned for a moment.</p>
<p>"No," she said flatly. She went back to her food.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because you don't talk, you preach, rant, order, and threaten. And you don't listen," she responded without looking up. Mike's response was cut short by the doorbell. He glared at Brooke.</p>
<p>"We're not done here," he warned.</p>
<p>"Whatever," she shrugged.</p>
<p>Mike left to answer the door with Brooke close behind. She never got to see anyone outside of Mike and her tutors and was desperate for some outside contact. The hairs on the back of her neck were standing on end and her skin was tingling but she wasn't sure why. Plus, she knew that Mike wasn't expecting any company.</p>
<p>"Good Lord, Kelly?" Mike gasped when he opened the door and saw his ex-wife and Brooke's mother Kelly standing there. She spared him a small smile but it lacked any warmth to qualify as friendly.</p>
<p>"Mike," she said politely in greeting. "Is Brooke home?"</p>
<p>"Mom?" Brooke asked astonished. She couldn't believe her mother was standing in the doorway. Kelly smiled warmly at her daughter.</p>
<p>"Hi honey. I'm in the area for a few gallery viewings and wanted to know if you wanted to spend some time with me," Kelly explained. "I know our relationship isn't the best but I'd like to try again to get to know you."</p>
<p>Brooke saw her way out, laid out before her almost like a gift on a shining golden platter. If she could go with Kelly, she could not only escape Mike but she could 1) see Sam; 2) report Mike and forever end his reign of horror; 3) stay with Sam and life would be good again. A huge smile spread across Brooke's face and she opened her mouth to scream `YES!'.</p>
<p>"No, she can't," Mike informed Kelly rudely. Kelly tilted her head slightly as she regarded her ex-husband.</p>
<p>"And why is that, Mike?" she asked sarcastically as Brooke tried to recover from the figurative kick to the ribs. Panic that Mike was about to steal her chance at escape was causing her to hyperventilate and make her dizzy.</p>
<p>&lt;Please God&gt; she prayed. &lt;Let Kelly get me out of here. PLEASE&gt;</p>
<p>"She's grounded," Mike growled, crossing his arms and looking stern. Kelly rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Come on, Mike. Don't be a dick. I don't visit that often. Let her come with me for a few days and she can finish her grounding when I bring her home," she reasoned.</p>
<p>"No," Mike shook his head, resolute. Kelly arched an eyebrow in challenge.</p>
<p>"Are you denying me my parental right to visitation as it is stated in our divorce papers?" she asked, her tone turning menacing. "Because if I remember correctly, the way we worked it out, you can't do just that. You have to let me see her when my schedule permits, providing that I don't interrupt or disrupt holiday plans. If you don't, then you forfeit, YOUR rights." Mike paled.</p>
<p>"But?" he stammered as he started to panic.</p>
<p>"Or we can go BACK to court and redo the whole custody thing," Kelly sighed. "AGAIN." Mike looked between the two women for a few minutes weighing his odds. He then glared at Brooke who was holding her breath waiting to see what he'd do.</p>
<p>"She can go. But I'm going to have a talk with her first. Wait in the living room, Kelly. We'll be right back," he snapped. Kelly nodded and Mike grabbed Brooke, dragging her up the stairs.</p>
<p>He slammed Brooke's bedroom door behind them, turning to his daughter barely in control of his fear and rage. Brooke eyed him fearfully.</p>
<p>"Let's get a few things straight, young lady," he snarled. "I HAVE to let you go with her, but if you say anything, ANYTHING about what's been going on around here, when I get my hands on you, you will regret the day you EVER took your first breath."</p>
<p>"Second, you stay the HELL away from Sam McPherson. I don't want to see or hear about you seeing her or talking to her and trust me, I have ways of knowing whether or not you do," he continued to threaten as Brooke packed a few things, shaking as she did so. Mike was so out of control that she was unsure she was going to get out of the house alive at this point. When she was done, she headed to the door. Mike used his bigger bulk to pin her against it.</p>
<p>"One more thing," he whispered, leaning in dangerously close. "You go to the police, Brooke, and it'll be the LAST thing you EVER do. Do you understand me?" Brooke nodded and refused to meet his eyes. </p>
<p>"And if YOU happen to forget, maybe I can remind Mac," he threatened. Brooke's stomach churned.</p>
<p>"No?" she croaked. Mike nodded, a cruel smile lighting up his face.</p>
<p>"Yes. Remember, Brooke, that I do have another daughter. If you can't obey me for your sake, think about her." Brooke swallowed the bile that rose up at the images of her father hurting a poor innocent and defenseless Mackenzie.</p>
<p>"I understand," she whispered, effectively silenced. She'd never let any harm come to Mac and she knew that Mike was aware of that. She's just been expertly emotionally blackmailed.</p>
<p>"Good. Remember what I told you and maybe this will all work out."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke was stone quiet as she got into her mothers metallic blue Mercedes SUV and shut the door. Kelly looked over to her once in concern but said nothing. The blonde teen was sheet white and trembling. After Kelly drove about three blocks away from the Palace, she pulled over.</p>
<p>"Brooke, are you all right?" she asked. Brooke nodded mutely.</p>
<p>"Did your father hurt you?" Kelly asked quietly. Brooke looked up in surprise at the question and met her mother's eyes. There was a depth of pain there that she hadn't expected to see. A few tears slipped down her face but she shook her head no. Kelly nodded.</p>
<p>"OK, I just have one stop to make and then we'll get going, all right?" Brooke shrugged one shoulder and stared out the window as Kelly pulled back onto the road.</p>
<p>Kelly's stop was a 7-11 about five miles away. She turned to Brooke.</p>
<p>"I have to run in and get something. And would you mind getting in the back?" Brooke silently did as she was asked and slumped down into the seat. </p>
<p>She didn't know what to do. She wanted so badly to tell Kelly what was going on but she was incredibly afraid of her father. Not only for herself but for Mac too.</p>
<p>"Damn it," she swore in a whisper.</p>
<p>"OK, I'm back," Kelly chirped getting into the car. "I brought you a Slurpee." Brooke looked up for the drink but Kelly's hands were empty. She frowned at her mother. Kelly smiled.</p>
<p>"Open your door, Brooke," she instructed. Brooke's frown deepened but she opened the door.</p>
<p>"Grape Slurpee, Madame?" Sam asked as she stepped into view holding out the drink. Brooke stared at her in shock.</p>
<p>"Sam? How? What?" she stuttered. She looked at her mother. "What's going on here?" Sam climbed into the car, set down the drinks and hugged Brooke tightly.</p>
<p>"Sam came to San Fran and told me what was going on, Pumpkin. EVERYTHING," Kelly explained watching as her daughter relaxed into Sam's touch and started to cry. She was wary of the relationship between the two girls but was willing to give it time and see exactly what was what before she made up her mind.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke sobbed into Sam's neck. "You did that?" Sam kissed Brooke's temple in comfort and stroked the blonde's hair as she held her.</p>
<p>"Yes. I told you I was going to get you out of there, didn't I?" She nuzzled Brooke's hair, just happy to have her in her arms. "I went to your mom, told her what was going on and asked her for her help. Help that she's willing to give, Brooke." Brooke pulled away from Sam slightly and looked at her mother.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," she sniffled.</p>
<p>"I can't take you to San Francisco, with me, Brooke. I'm sorry but I'm still not the mother you need. Jane McPherson is. But I'm willing to do whatever I have to to get you away from your father. Whether you file for emancipation or try to get Jane to take custody of you or however the legal system works, I'll support you," Kelly explained.</p>
<p>"You're free, Brooke," Sam whispered. "You never have to go back." Brooke burst into fresh tears.</p>
<p>"But?" she started and stopped.</p>
<p>"'But' what, Brooke?" Sam prompted.</p>
<p>"Mac?" she said softly. Sam frowned and leaned down to catch Brooke's eye.</p>
<p>"What about Mac?" A sinking feeling had settled in Sam's stomach and her heart had started to pound. Brooke looked into Sam's rich chocolate eyes.</p>
<p>"He threatened her, Sammy. He said if I told anyone, he's take it out on her," she explained quietly. Sam paled.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ," Kelly breathed. Anger and rage filled every cell of Sam's being.</p>
<p>"I'll kill him. I'll fucking kill him first," she swore.</p>
<p>"Girls, let's go to Jane's and tell her what's going on," Kelly said reasonably. "Then we'll figure things out from there. OK?" Both girls nodded and Kelly headed out of the parking lot.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy," Brooke whispered settling into Sam's arms for the ride to Sam's house. Sam held onto her tightly.</p>
<p>"I only did what I had to to help you," Sam responded. "I love you and I'd do whatever it took. You know that." Brooke nodded against her.</p>
<p>"I know. But I also know it couldn't have been easy to go to Kelly and explain everything." Sam rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"No, no it wasn't. There's a conversation I never want to have again," she giggled. Brooke got quiet again for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"It'll work out, won't it, Sam?" she asked, openly vulnerable and needing to be reassured. Sam kissed her gently and smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes. I promise it will. I'll make sure of it," Sam vowed.</p>
