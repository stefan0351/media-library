<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 8 -->

<p>The Captain was sitting at her desk with her head in her hands. After the
incident last night and being checked out by the Doctor, Janeway wanted to talk
with Seven, to apologize and explain things. But every time the Captain asked
where Seven was the computer gave the same response, 'Seven of Nine is located
directly outside the brig'. It appeared that Seven always kept in close
proximity to the brig because not once did the computer reply that Seven was on
deck 8 section 14. After hearing the computer reply that same damned answer ten
times over, in a period of two hours, the Captain found that even if she tried
to fall asleep she wouldn't be able to. So she ended up in her ready room,
wondering when exactly she had lost Seven to B'Elanna. But did she really have
Seven to begin with? The Captain knew that Seven must have stayed near the brig
the entire night and into the morning because she did check on Seven's location
every once in a while. Although the last time the Captain did check on Seven it
was five in the morning. She just couldn't take hearing that cold voice reply once
again that Seven was near the brig.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, that Janeway was surprised to find Seven coming through
the ready room doors unannounced. Some things never change and Janeway was
thankful for that. Her slight smile faltered at Seven's first words to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, may we sit at your couch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Back to Captain already, Seven? Have I hurt you that much?&quot;
Katherine asked as she led Seven over to the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, I can not lie to you because I still do care and respect you.
You have hurt me even though I know you did not mean to just as I do not wish
to hurt you but I fear I will. Unfortunately, you must hear what I have to say
so that no one else will get hurt needlessly. Recently, I have come to realize
that I am in love with B'Elanna Torres long before I even understood what love
was. When you kissed me I felt like I had betrayed the love I have for Lanna.
Captain, Katherine, I do respect you, admire you, and think of you as my only
family but I can not give you my heart because it already belongs to
another.&quot;</p>

<p>By the end of her emotional outpouring, Seven had realized that she now held
the Captain's hands in her own. Seven was all new to this but figured that she
was just going on instinct. Katherine had one or two tear drops sliding down
her face as she tried to control the overwhelming sense of being too late and
losing something very special.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure what you feel for B'Elanna is love?&quot; Katherine had
to ask though her voice sounded rough from all the emotions she was so
desperately trying to contain.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, Katherine, after all my research into the subject of love and
analyzing the data I collected on human mating rituals I still was unable to
figure out a proper definition of what love is. It was not until I began to
analyze my thoughts and feelings for B'Elanna that I was able to put words to
the emotion of love. For me love is the lonely feeling I feel when not around
Lanna despite being in a crowded room. Love is the 'butterflies in the stomach'
feeling I get when I am around Lanna. Love is being able to forgive Lanna for
being the one single person on this ship who has hurt me the most. Love is the
understanding I give Lanna when I can not comprehend what she means. Love is
being able to listen to Lanna when she has anything to say at anytime. Love is
the unconditional love I can give to Lanna even during the times I hate her.
Love is the opposite of hate and I do not hate Lanna therefore I must love her.
I love B'Elanna Torres with all that I am and all that I am not. She is my perfection,
my omega molecule. I love her intelligence, her dry wit, her dedication, her
loyalty, her passion, but I also love her temper, her impulsiveness, her
aggression, her attitude, and her protective streak no matter how unnecessary
it is. I love the good and the bad. It is not something that happened it is
just something that is.&quot;</p>

<p>If Katherine had any doubts about Seven not being emotionally ready or not
having the understanding of complex human emotions, she was wrong and she
certainly had none now. Janeway was so moved by the empowered speech that she
no longer felt it worth a fight to tear B'Elanna and Seven apart. In truth,
Katherine only wanted to have Seven happy and if being with Torres was what would
make her happy then who was Janeway to stand in the way. The Captain was
willing to let Seven go and settle with just being friends or even family to
Seven but none the less Katherine knew she had lost something very precious,
something she would regret losing for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven are you sure you never assimilated a poet because you could very
well pass for one.&quot; The Captain said even as she had fresh tears sliding
down her cheeks, moved beyond words from Seven's speech on love.</p>

<p>&quot;If I did Captain, his knowledge would have been deemed irrelevant and
discarded.&quot; Seven replied. Even though she knew Katherine was joking,
Seven wanted to make sure that she understood that this is what she felt not a
poet or anyone else.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand Seven. I want you to know that although I am sorry for
the pain I have caused you, I can not be sorry for loving you. I know that you
can not love me back but I do hope that we can remain friends. I only want you
to be happy and if B'Elanna makes you happy then I wish you both the best of
luck.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven took Katherine's face in her hands and leaned in to place a chaste
kiss on the other woman's lips.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry that this is hurting you but I am glad that we can still
remain friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Always, Seven, always.&quot; The Captain wrapped her arms around the
borg turned human basking in being able to hold her love close even if it was
only a platonic hug.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, there is another matter I wish to speak with you about.&quot;
Seven said as she backed slightly away from Katherine leaving her hoping that
the worst was already over. It is about B'Elanna's imprisonment.&quot;</p>

<p>Janeway jumped up off the couch and began to pace the ready room floor. 'Now
Seven wants to talk about Torres being in prison?' After all it was B'Elanna
who stole Seven from me and then hit me, a commanding officer, for it.'
Apparently, Seven surmised that this was a sore point for the proud Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;You want me to release her from the brig, don't you Seven? Well, I
can't do that. After all she did commit a crime and must be punished
accordingly.&quot; Janeway's temper began to rise.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not wish for you to release B'Elanna from prison but as you have
said it yourself, she must be punished accordingly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you insinuating that I am not dealing with this situation
appropriately?&quot; If Seven thought Klingon tempers were bad she hasn't seen
anything yet.</p>

<p>&quot;I...&quot; Seven was thankfully interrupted by the chime to the door.</p>

<p>Seven had never had a reason to sigh from relief before but there was a
first time for everything. Janeway called for whoever to enter and in walks
Tuvok. Janeway had to wonder about his timing.</p>

<p>&quot;Tuvok. What can I do for you?&quot; The Captain tried to school her
temper.</p>

<p>&quot;I need to discuss a security matter with you, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can this wait?&quot; Janeway wanted to finish her conversation with
Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm afraid not.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. Seven you're dismissed but I would like to continue our
little talk at a later time.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven nodded to both officers after being dismissed and walked out of the
room. As Seven walked across the bridge all eyes were trained on her. Stopping
right in front of the aft engineering station, even turned to Chakotay who
stood in front of the Captain's chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you Commander. Although you are human you're timing is
impeccable. I would have preferred a minute sooner but I am grateful for the
interruption none the less.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anytime, Seven, anytime.&quot; Chakotay smiled realizing that he
couldn't put anything past the borg not even a minor planned interruption.</p>

<p>Seven continued on her way into the turbolift left with only one more errand
to run. She left a very quiet but smirking bridge crew behind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the Captain's ready room, Tuvok and the Captain were
heatedly talking about Lt. Torres's imprisonment. Tuvok logically pointed out
that the Captain was too emotionally involved causing an over reaction on her
part. Tuvok pointed out that the punishment does not fit the crime and that
only a five day incarceration and a reprimand noted in the computer logs would
suffice. Also the no visitors command was a bit extreme and Tuvok managed to
talk Janeway into agreeing to change the punishment. Just as soon as Janeway
agreed, Tuvok noted the change in status of the prisoner in the computer logs.
Unfortunately, Tom also caught wind of the change almost immediately and set
off to finally go see B'Elanna.</p>
