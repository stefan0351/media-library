<!-- Listen to Your Heart \ Chapter II -->

<p>The Lieutenant is more irritating then ever before.<br>It seems that the doctor's medical report on her present condition did not include the effects the memory loss would have on her personality.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant and I are not friends. Although it is not hostile anymore our relationship still can be described as antagonistic. Because of that I had no intention to visit her in sickbay. But certain circumstances lead to the situation that I had to accompany Miral on her first visit with her mother.</p>
<p>I found this situation awkward. Since I did not know how to interact with the Lieutenant I decided to remain silent and wait until Miral was ready to go back to her father.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant tried to engage in conversation, though. She asked me to call her by her first name. I did comply in front of the child. Since the Lieutenant is not her usual self I thought it could 'do no harm'.</p>
<p>Miral's visit ended abruptly when the Lieutenant in apparent confusion declared her love for me.<br>The doctor then asked me and Miral to leave sickbay. I assume that he, too, was not aware of the intensity of her personality change and needed to run further tests.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>B'El- The Lieutenant continued to ask for me during the following days. I refused to visit her. I failed to see any necessity for or any use in such action. I would not be able to help her. Since we were not friends I deemed it a waste of time. Mine as well as hers.</p>
<p>Commander Chakotay, Tuvok and the Doctor tried to persuade me to give in to B'El- the Lieutenants wish to see me. The captain threatened to give me another lecture in english poetry of the 18th century. I am confident that she merely meant to emphasize how important it was to her that I visited B'Elanna. The Lieutenant.</p>
<p>Although threats are futile and irrelevant I finally gave in.</p>
<p>Miral had witnessed her Mother's declaration of love for me. To my surprise she seemed to be positively affected by this. Although I tried to explain her mother's condition to her, she did not falter in her belief that her mother truly feels this way towards me. Her arguing included that I am her friend, too. She did not understand why I would not be friends with her mother.</p>
<p>Since my experience with Naomi Wildman the ship's crew trusted me with their offspring. I am asked to look after their children on a regular basis. I became Miral's 'babysitter' during the time of the Torres-Paris break up.<br>I did not volunteer nor did Miral's parents ask me to. Naomi brought her littler friend to me and asked me to be her friend too, like I was hers when she was younger. I complied.</p>
<p>And now my friend asked me to visit her mother. Again I did comply.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>B'Elanna has been informed by the captain and the doctor about the relations aboard Voyager. I notice that she still struggles to keep all the facts in memory and order.</p>
<p>The captain asked me to re-introduce B'Elanna to the life on a star ship. My task would be to teach her the use of the technical devices like turbo lifts, replicators, sonic showers, the recycler and re-familiarize her with the ship's decks and site plan.</p>
<p>B'Elanna never again mentioned her feelings for me. I had discarded the statement as invalid because of her condition.</p>
<p>I asked her why she wanted me to accompany her during the process of re-learning the basic knowledge and skills. She told me that she felt safe in my presence. That she trusted me. I have heard that before. From Naomi and Miral.</p>
<p>The captain approved of Tuvoks suggestion that I move in with B'Elanna and Miral as long as B'Elanna might need help in her daily routine.</p>
<p>Officially B'Elanna is still the Chief Engineer. But since she does not remember anything the captain put her on indefinite medical leave.</p>
<p>I am allowed to schedule my time as I deem it necessary and efficient. I decided to supervise the works in Astrometry and Engineering equally. B'Elanna follows me everywhere. I noticed that she is very eager to learn. She is very interested and inquires a lot. I am endeavoured to answer all her questions, but sometimes I find myself not able to give her an appropriate explanation.<br>I also find that this affects me.<br>It affected me always. But it is different now.<br>With the Lieutenant, the Chief Engineer, I felt inferior when I had no answer.<br>With B'Elanna I feel a virtual pain when I cannot help her.<br>This is my friend. And she relies on me.</p>
