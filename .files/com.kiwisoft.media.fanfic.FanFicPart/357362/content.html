<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 8-->
<p>"I know...yeah I know...listen I'm talking to you now aren't I?  That was
unnecessarily harsh and bitchy.  No.  She's not a canned meat.  If Gwyneth
and Winonna could make up after the "Shakespeare in Love" fiasco the fact
that I no longer have homicidal feelings towards Sam should not shock and
alarm you.  Nic...I'm not trying to silence you.  Yeah, okay." Brooke was
holding the phone to her ear with her shoulder as she made her way down the
stairs.  Since had been neglecting Nicole and the Glamazons since entering
into her relationship with Sam and was now reaping the consequences.  Nicole
Julian was not a woman that tolerated being put on hold well, Brooke knew
this and now she was paying for the oversight.</p>

<p>"She wants what!?!  I know part of the reason we like and fear her is
because she's insane but has she completely lost it?  I don't want to
control her and I don't want her to worship me.  Both of those options are
really, really disturbing, why can't she just find god or something?
There's no way we're wearing maroon and yellow, I'd wear Cher's 1998 Oscar
outfit before I'd go near that colour combination," Brooke continued as she
made her way towards the kitchen.  Brooke loved Mary Cherry in a weird sort
of way, but sometimes the girl really freaked her out.</p>

<p>As the cheerleader turned the corner she stopped dead in her tracks her
mouth forming a perfect 'O' as she gaped at the room in front of her.  The
lights in the kitchen were out the only illumination coming from a myriad of
candles spread all over the room, and rose petals were spread all over the
floor.  "I'll call you back...no gotta go...bye," Brooke responded clicking the
phone off not even waiting for a response.</p>

<p>At the sound of Brooke's voice, Sam took a deep breath and turned around.
She had absolutely no idea what she was doing, or whether or not it was
going to work, but she knew that she was doing it, and she figured that at
least that was worth something.  She hadn't seen Brooke since early that
morning, their schedules for that day conflicting, so when she caught her
first real look at the cheerleader her breath caught in her throat.  The
pale orange light from the candles created a halo effect around Brooke's
face, that combined with the satiny pink outfit Brooke was wearing made her
appear like something eternal, something out of a dream.  And, Sam realized
that's exactly what she was.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" Brooke asked softly walking towards her girlfriend.  Sam
was dressed in black pants, and a retro red tank top and Brooke felt her
eyes drawn towards her frame.  There was definitely nothing wrong with Sam's
form Brooke thought to herself as she moved forward.</p>

<p>"Dinner," Sam responded her attention completely focused on the approaching
figure.  In response to Sam's answer Brooke raked her eyes around the room
taking it all in.</p>

<p>"It's not my birthday," Brooke said contemplatively.  "It's not your
birthday," she went on.  "It's not Gertrude Stein, or Edaf Plath, or even
Freda Khalo's birthday," Brooke continued reveling in the smile that spread
across Sam's face, "which, if I didn't know better, would lead me to
conclude that you were trying to seduce me." The last part came out in a low
drawl as she reached for Sam.</p>

<p>"What makes you think I'm not trying to seduce you?" Sam asked curiously
since that was exactly what she was trying to do.</p>

<p>"The fact that you've already got me," Brooke responded reaching out and
taking Sam's hand in hers.  Brooke loved Sam's hands, she had probably spent
hours looking at them and tracing them and holding them since that fateful
night in the kitchen.  They were so small, and elegant, yet powerful.  They
made Brooke doubt the saying 'the pen is mighty than the sword'.  Sam's pen
had never conquered her but those hands had, they had rendered her helpless,
dependant, over and over again and Brooke hoped that they would continue to.</p>

<p>"Do I?" Sam asked momentarily dropping her eyes from Brooke's.  "...have you?"</p>

<p>Brooke reached out with her free hand placing it under Sam's chin raising
her head up so that she was looking at her once again.  "Yes," she whispered
intensely, her eyes burning into Sam's.  "You do."</p>

<p>Brooke took a step back placing some distance between her and Sam, but
remained holding the brunette's hand.  "What is this?  Really," Brooke
asked.</p>

<p>Sam smiled self-consciously.  "An attempt to seduce you," was her verbal
response.</p>

<p>"You did that a long time ago," Brooke responded.</p>

<p>"That's not what I mean.  This," Sam said looking down at their linked hands
as she spoke, "isn't what I mean.  I...suppose there's no tactful way to put
it so I'll just...well I want us to be together...physically," Sam finished
deciding to stop talking before she could screw things up even more.</p>

<p>"Oh," Brooke responded in that charming, verbose and witty way of hers.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Sam muttered beginning to pull her hand out of Brooke's.</p>

<p>"Wait," Brooke said moving with her so that their hands stayed connected.
"No 'oh god', at least not now, maybe later, but not now," she continued
smiling.  "I want to...I mean you and I are..." Brooke took a deep breath trying
to settle her thoughts.  "If I could form a coherent sentence, the message
it would convey would be one of complete agreement."</p>

<p>Sam took a step forward once Brooke finished speaking and moved into the
circle of her arms resting her head just above Brooke's breast.  "I know
that you've...that when you and...I wanted this to be different, and not just in
the obvious logistical way."</p>

<p>Brooke smiled at the last part of Sam's sentence and brought her hand up to
the brunette's cheek.
"In all honesty being attacked by a brigand of commando fire ants would have
been better than what happened between me and he whose name shall not be
mentioned," Brooke began.  "But with us, whatever happens, it'll be gold
because what we have is special and wanted and beautiful," she concluded,
and with that she tilted her head down and brought their lips together.</p>

<p>When they parted Sam looked at Brooke with open eyes that were shinning with
unshed and asked in a soft wondrous tone, "Who are you?  That you do what
you do to me?"</p>

<p>Brooke paused for a moment thinking that it should have been she who posed
that question as it was very true to her particular situation as well.  "I'm
just a girl, standing in front of a girl, asking her to love me," Brooke
responded with her most serious face on.  If it worked for Julia Roberts she
didn't see why it shouldn't work for her too.</p>

<p>Sam smiled and let out a breath she didn't know she had been holding.  "Can
you eat?" she asked Brooke taking her hand.</p>

<p>The cheerleader's response was to look over at her wide-eyed and sputter,
"Wha...I...what?" as her face turned an interesting shade of red.</p>

<p>"Dinner?" Sam clarified, a small smile spreading across her face that she
immediately tried to smoother.</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew that," Brooke replied her normal complexion returning.  "Stop
laughing," she implored as Sam squeezed her hand and walked her over to the
table.  "Come on...please," Brooke continued in a most piteous tone as Sam
still chuckled.</p>

<p>"Save THAT for later," was all the brunette said in response as she sat down
causing Brooke's face to once again turn a most interesting shade of red.</p>
