<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Seven -->

<p>Sam had decided against having a big birthday party, opting instead for just a family dinner. Not even Nicole was invited to the outing, which made Brooke very, very happy. And Nicole very, very jealous.</p>
<p>The family went to dinner at Sam's favorite restaurant and had a great time. She got clothes, CDs and computer programs from her mother and Mike, as well as a new; leather bound journal to write in. From Brooke she received a beautiful amethyst necklace that made her gasp to look at. It was stunning in color and cut and Sam knew by looking at it that it couldn't have been cheap.</p>
<p>"God, Brooke, you shouldn't have," she said in awe. Brooke blushed.</p>
<p>"Do you like it? Because I can return it if you don't. I know jewelry isn't your thing..." Brooke babbled.</p>
<p>"I love it," Sam interrupted her, putting the necklace on to prove her point. "Really, thank you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Brooke's blush deepened.</p>
<p>"Brooke, don't you have something else for Sam?" Mike asked with a wide smile. He was almost more excited than Brooke was. Sam's eyes got wide.</p>
<p>"More? No, Brooke, really you shouldn't..." Brooke handed Sam a plain manila folder which Sam eyed carefully.</p>
<p>"It's not full of Anthrax, is it?" she asked with a smirk. Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"Ha ha, Sam. No, just open it," Brooke giggled. She was nearly bouncing from excitement. Sam smiled and opened the envelope, pulling out a brochure.</p>
<p>"'Your All Access Guide to Telluride'? What's this?" she asked confused. Brooke grinned.</p>
<p>"See what else is in there, Sam," she advised. Sam reached in again and pulled out vouchers for skiing and snowboarding rentals and lessons, meals at the best local restaurants, tickets to a few local shows, and much more.</p>
<p>"It's a complete vacation package to Telluride," Sam said still stupefied. Brooke handed over two more pieces of paper.</p>
<p>"Two first class plane tickets?" Sam exclaimed. She stared at Brooke shocked. "Is this for real?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sammy, very real. Do you like it?" Brooke asked worried. She knew Sam was touchy when it came to stuff having to do with her father and she hoped that she hadn't just overstepped some unseen boundary.</p>
<p>"I...I...I...how did you know?" Sam whispered as tears streaked unchecked down her face and she stared at the tabletop. Brooke shot a panicked look at Jane, afraid that she had just ruined everything.</p>
<p>"I told her, honey," Jane said gently. "She wanted to get the perfect gift for you and I remembered that skiing trip you took with your dad."</p>
<p>"The necklace would have been more than enough," Sam sniffled.</p>
<p>"I can get refunds on everything if you hate the idea, Sam," Brooke said, fighting her own tears. "I never meant to hurt you or ruin your birthday." Sam shook her head and lifted it to look at Brooke.</p>
<p>"You haven't. It isn't that," the look of gratitude on her face shocked Brooke. "It's just...it just means so much because I never thought I'd get the chance. I can never repay this, Brooke." Brooke smiled, relieved.</p>
<p>"It's a gift, Sam. You don't repay gifts," she said with a happy sigh. A strange look passed over Sam's face.</p>
<p>"Two tickets? You're going with me, right Brooke?" Although stated as a question, the force behind it left no doubt as to which answer Sam wanted. Brooke smiled widely and nodded. Her insides fluttered with happiness.</p>
<p>"Of course, if you want me to."</p>
<p>"Yes, I want you to. You went through all this trouble. It wouldn't be fair if you didn't get to share in the fun," Sam declared, getting up and giving Brooke the biggest hug known to mankind. Mike and Jane watched happily.</p>
<p>"Looks like our little family is finally coming together, doesn't it?" Mike beamed at Jane.</p>
<p>"It does, doesn't it?" she grinned back.</p>
