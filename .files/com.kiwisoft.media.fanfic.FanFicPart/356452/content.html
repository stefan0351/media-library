<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>It was a cold damp night, with a light mist falling as the two girls made
thier way out of Restfield Cemetery.</p>

<p>&#34;And next week after Spike's and my love baby....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;What!&#34; The Witch demanded as the unusual conversation finally registered in
her preoccupied mind.  And Willow was lost when she looked into her lover's
laughing face.</p>

<p>&#34;Well, you've hardly said two words to me all patrol,&#34; Buffy explained with
a mischievous smile forming.  &#34;So I thought you needed a little teasing.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow blushed; Buffy was right, she was so caught up in what Angel had said
about the Book of Souls she couldn't think about anything else.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm sorry, it's just that....&#34; Willow started.</p>

<p>&#34;That Angel came up with something concerning the Book?&#34; Buffy finished her
smile disappearing. All the earlier amusement gone from her face as the calm
mask she wore when trying to hide her pain slammed down across her
expressive features.</p>

<p>Willow could feel the slayer pulling into herself-&#34;Stop that Buffy, right
now!&#34; The witch told her.  &#34;Don't even try to hide what you are feeling to
me!&#34;</p>

<p>The slayer blinked.</p>

<p>&#34;You know I can feel you when we're this close, so don't pull that 'I'm so
tough nothing bothers me' routine.&#34; Willow answered the Slayer's unspoken
question.</p>

<p>Buffy touched and then took Willow's hand stopping and turning to face the
young witch.</p>

<p>Willow plowed on, &#34;you know, Buffy, sometimes talking things out helps put
them into the proper perspective.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's not that Will, &#34; she started. &#34;It's just my feelings are still so
jumbled over the argument I had with Angel, and now's not the time or place
to sort them out.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow had to admit that Buffy was right, but not to be defeated so easily
she bargained:  &#34;Okay, I see your point, standing in the middle of the
street, at night during patrol is not the place for a heart to heart.&#34;  The
red head smiled, &#34;how about we swing by the Bronze and then pack it in?&#34;</p>

<p>She knew she had won when Buffy smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>They resumed walking towards the Bronze each seemingly lost in their own
thoughts.  After a few blocks of silence the slayer glanced at the red head
as if she wanted to ask something....</p>

<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow gently questioned.</p>

<p>Buffy looked down and then away.  &#34;Well, ah, was Angel any help?  I mean
with the Book?  I know you have been awfully involved with it.&#34;</p>

<p>The witch sighed, &#34;Yes and no.&#34; She was at a loss to explain why he was a
help and yet he wasn't.  Or even why she was so incredibly obsessed with one
indecipherable passage when there were so many parts she could translate.</p>

<p>&#34;Um, could you vague that up a little?&#34; Buffy's joked, breaking into
Willow's frustrated thoughts.  &#34;You know sometimes talking things out helps
put them into the proper perspective.&#34;  The slayer added with a tiny
chuckle.</p>

<p>The witch groaned.  &#34;Yes, and those wise words are very true.&#34;</p>

<p>They walked a few more steps as Willow formed the ideas into words-&#34;he was
able to confirm that the passage was written in ancient High Gaelic.&#34; She
paused, and realized that she had instinctively reached out for Buffy's
hand.  Pulling it up to kiss it, finding comfort in the blonde's touch.</p>

<p>She traced the delicate bones of Buffy's hand--marveling at the power that
lay dormant within.  Power that used and directed in one way could in less
than a moment crush bones and take lives. Yet, used in another way could
create unimaginable pleasure for the person the Slayer loved. Somehow, when
Willow discovered that small passage buried within the Book, she knew it
held the same power.</p>

<p>&#34;The power to create or destroy.&#34; Willow mumbled.</p>

<p>&#34;How so Wills?&#34; Buffy asked clearly confused by the witch's sudden
withdrawal.</p>

<p>&#34;He said that he thinks it is either from the same time period or might even
pre-date Arthur of Thirteen Battles.&#34;  Willow said shaking her head to clear
it.</p>

<p>She felt a slight tingle of confusion from her lover so she explained
further.  &#34;King Arthur, you know the knight's of the round table and all
that?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, yeah, Camelot?&#34; The slayer questioned as they began to walk again.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, sort of, except most of the legend has gone pretty much
Hollywood....&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No!&#34; The blonde sighed, dramatically.  &#34;You mean all those movies were
wrong?&#34;</p>

<p>The young red head couldn't stop the laugh that her lover's playful joking
invoked.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, yes, every one of those plays and movies were the Gods honest
truth-from Bernard Shaw to Excaliber--they were completely based on fact!&#34;
Willow said, trying to keep a serious face, pretending along with
Buffy-breaking the tension she felt building between them since the mention
of Angel.</p>

<p>They were quiet for another block or two; both lost again in they're own
thoughts, only this time they still held each other's hands maintaining
contact.</p>

<p>&#34;So, did he help?&#34; Buffy repeated her earlier question-no need to say who
'he&#34; was.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, I think so.  'He' was able to at least spell the passage phonically.&#34;
Willow answered.  &#34;But, he had no clue what the words meant.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So it could have been King Arthur's grocery list for all we know?&#34;  Buffy
stated.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, no, it has power, Buffy, it....&#34; Suddenly the slayer stopped and
tensed.  Willow knew that something was had alerted the blonde to danger.</p>

<p>Willow released the slayer's hand and watched her do a slow pivot, her head
canting to one side as if listening for something that only she could hear.</p>

<p>After a second to get her bearings the blonde took off in the direction of
the Bronze expecting her lover to follow her-which Willow did as fast as she
could.</p>

<p>When they turned the corner into an alley near the Bronze they found a
vampire with his back turned to the street holding a young teenage girl.  He
appeared as if he was getting ready to sink his fangs into her neck.</p>

<p>&#34;Shouldn't snack this close to bed time?&#34; the slayer quipped, as she skidded
to a stop in the middle of the alley.  &#34;Didn't your sire teach you
anything?&#34;</p>

<p>Willow watched in horror as the vampire turned to face them-he didn't have
his &#34;game face&#34; on so that could only mean one thing....</p>

<p>&#34;My, my, Slayer,&#34; came a hissing demonic voice from behind them. &#34;I was
beginning to think that you and your little red headed bitch were going to
miss our little party.&#34;</p>

<p>It was a trap; Willow belatedly finished her thought.</p>

<p>The girls turned as one and found they were facing a group of six vampires
and three minor demons who were rapidly spreading out in a lose circle
around them.</p>

<p>Sensing a magical threat Willow faced the demon that was obviously the
leader of the merry band.  The Witch felt Buffy take up the position
directly behind her, placing them back to back.</p>

<p>&#34;Let her go,&#34; Buffy said twirling a stake in one hand and one of the dirks
in the other. &#34;It's us you want or don't you think you've brought enough
help.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I'm hurt Slayer,&#34; the demon hissed. &#34;Here our Lord went to such lengths to
provide you with the proper entertainment to make sure we kept your
interest, and you worry about the expendable extras.  Tsk, tsk.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;They always gotta talk,&#34; the slayer said and without warning threw her
stake in the heart of the closest vampire. As if that was the invisible
signal the battle was on-the demon in front of Willow attacking her
magically while the remaining vampires and demons attacked Buffy physically.</p>

<p>The red head knew that their position was not the best in the world.
Buffy's natural fighting style used her speed as a weapon-protecting
Willow's back meant that she had to stand and pound it out-rather than hit
and evade.  While the young Witch was holding her own against the lead
demon's magic, she couldn't break away from his attack to give the slayer
aid.  Plus, these minions from hell seemed to have some kind of
training-every time Buffy tried to maneuver them into a more defensible
position they were cut off.</p>

<p>Then all other thoughts flew from Willow's mind as some kind of strong dark
magic began reinforcing the lead demon's own magic taking nearly all her
strength to hold him back.</p>

<p>Finally, the lead demon made a mistake that gave Willow an opening-without
consciously thinking about it she threw a huge ball of explosive blue flame
that blew the lead demon back into the street.  She kept an eye on him
making sure he didn't get up as she turned around to help Buffy.</p>

<p>The slayer was winning but just barely: the air was filled with the dust of
destroyed vampires. One of the lessor demons tried to attack the witch and
she managed to completely expel it.</p>

<p>After that the two remaining vampires grabbed their leader and ran off.</p>

<p>Seeing the vampires flee Buffy collapsed to one knee and for the first time
since the battle began Willow was able to look at her lover and the sight
horrified her.  Her beloved had dual gashes down the entire length of her
forearm from the claws of the demon she'd killed and something had laid open
her cheek to the bone.</p>

<p>The blonde's blood was flowing from those and several smaller wounds soaking
her coat and dripping onto the wet pavement. By the way Buffy was panting
Willow could tell that the blonde was very nearly at the end of her
reserves.</p>

<p>The Witch had forgotten about the lone remaining vampire until he spoke.</p>

<p>&#34;A little something to help you remember me,&#34; he hissed angrily and sank his
fangs into the forgotten the girl's neck at the pulse point and began
feeding as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up with dazed and glassy eyes and saw what was happening. It
still took a few seconds for what the vampire was doing to register but when
it did she was a blur of action.</p>

<p>&#34;NO!&#34; she screamed and dove at the feeding beast ramming the stake through
it's heart, only before it burst into a cloud of dust it bit down hard on
the young's neck severing her jugular.</p>

<p>With all the speed given to her by her slayer genetics Buffy was able to
catch the girl's limp body before it hit the ground but she was too late.
The beautiful young girl's life pumped out of her body, as the slayer
helplessly watched her blood mixing with Buffy's as her life faded away.</p>

<p>The girl's last words were &#34;I didn't know.&#34;</p>

<p>Willow watched her lover hug the girl's limp body to her chest and began to
gently rock her with growing dread.</p>

<p>&#34;This is going to be bad,&#34; she mumbled to herself as she began setting up
wards and barriers to protect them from further attack.  Thanking the Gods
for the first time tonight for the light mist because it would help wash
away the smell of Buffy's blood.</p>

<p>She turned back to her lover to find the blonde holding and rocking the girl
moaning softly--tears flowing unchecked down her face.</p>

<p>Guilt was eating at Willow's resolve--because she too, had forgotten about
the girl during the heat of the fight-maybe she could have done something,
anything that could have saved her.  What good were all her powers if
through negligence she still let a life slip between her fingers?</p>

<p>Another soft moan pulled the red head's attention away from the dead girl
and to her lover.  She could tell that Buffy was fading fast and they needed
to get out of there and home as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>She knelt down by the slayer and gently stroked the side of her face that
wasn't cut.  The slayer's skin felt hot and dry to Willow, which meant that
she had a high fever.</p>

<p>&#34;Love, Buffy, honey, we have to leave, now.&#34; She said to the unresponsive
girl.  Buffy didn't seem to realize Willow was there, next to her, touching
her.</p>

<p>&#34;Please Buffy, we have to get home, please....&#34; Willow pleaded and at last
the slayer came back to herself.  She blinked, then quietly placed the girl
on the wet pavement.</p>

<p>The witch helped the blonde stand and supported her as they slowly made
their way home.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Once home, Willow helped her lover to their couch and put Buffy into a deep
healing sleep and then washed out the worst of her wounds.  But the blonde
had a raging fever-Willow thought from some kind of venom the demon used on
his claws.  When the witch used her 'sight' though, she saw that the
slayer's natural defenses were defeating the poison, it just meant she had
to wait before treating the gashes.</p>

<p>By that time the little witch was almost asleep on her feet and not wanting
to wake her lover, Willow laid down next to her on the couch.  As they slept
Willow's subconscious put up wards around them and reached out to her
soulmate's mind.  When Willow felt the new indelible darkness the night's
events had placed on Buffy's soul she began weeping in her sleep.  Somehow
knowing that her lover would go through the rest of her life carrying the
memory of the innocent girl's death and blaming herself for it.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The tiny entity watched the Slayer's friend get out of the car in front of
the Townhouse.  He had witnessed the bloody battle the night before and had
tried, unsuccessfully, to attach to some of the slayer's clothing.  Thinking
that since she was barely conscious she wouldn't notice him--but the
protections the Witch had placed around the pair, once again, kept him at a
distance.</p>

<p>The Raven was at its post in the oak tree so it would be tricky to get to
the friend before it saw him-though with the Mistress' growing impatience
death from the bird eating him would be a mercy-if he were to fail.</p>

<p>Luck was shining on him because just as the Raven's sweeping gaze turned
away from his hiding place--the tall brunette paused apparently seeing
something of interest on the sidewalk-it was his chance and he took it. He
landed on the hem of her dress and quickly crawled up under it out of sight.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Cordelia was walking up to the door of the townhouse shared by Buffy and
Willow, determined to get the two love birds out of the nest and downtown to
the seamstress.  The two had been too busy lately, saving the world or some
such trivia, to schedule their final fitting.  And unless they wanted to
attend their wedding naked this was going to be one of their last chances.</p>

<p>She'd finally won the battle with Giles and Xander and had gotten them to
the tailors for their tuxedo fittings yesterday.  Willow had gone into her
own funds and bought the two men their tuxes saying that it was only fair,
after all the brides maids always got their outfits paid for so why not the
guys?  Besides, she confided in Cordy, this way she knew Xander wouldn't
show up in some powder blue monstrosity.</p>

<p>Cordelia reached the door and paused before knocking--putting on her &#34;wrath
of Cordelia&#34; face so there would be no augments. After a few minutes with no
answer she tried again, after the third time Cordelia noticed a trail of
dried blood leading up the sidewalk to the door.</p>

<p>Worried about her friends she got out the keys they'd given her and let
herself in. She slowly opened the door calling out their names as she
entered the townhouse.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy...Willow?&#34; She called out. &#34;Is anybody home?  Come on guys it's me
Cordy.&#34;</p>

<p>She saw an eerie green glow emanating from the oversized couch.
Investigating-- Cordelia found them--lying on the couch Willow curled up
next to Buffy her head resting on lover's stomach.</p>

<p>Cordelia could see the source of the blood trail-Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Must've been a rough night of slaying.&#34; She mumbled quietly.</p>

<p>When she walked around to the front of the couch she noticed both girls were
crying in their sleep.</p>

<p>&#34;Must've been a really rough night,&#34; she amended.</p>

<p>She reached down to try and wake up Willow--but when her hand came in
contact with the green glow an electric like jolt ran up her arm forcing her
to step back.</p>

<p>Immediately the glow disappeared and Willows eyes flew open as she launched
herself off the couch.  The little red head landed in a defensive stance,
with a ball of intense blue flame forming in her hand.</p>

<p>&#34;Geese Willow!&#34; Cordelia shouted, taking another step back.  &#34;Paranoid
much?&#34; She asked throwing up her hands in a defense gesture.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah...Cordy?&#34;  Willow asked trying to blink her vision clear.  Then she
plopped down on the coffee table next to the couch.  Cordelia could see the
lines of exhaustion and worry plainly in her friend's face.  She watched as
Willow seemed shocked to find the flaming sphere still formed in her hand.</p>

<p>Saw her friend flush in embarrassment as she apologized, &#34;Sorry bout that.&#34;
And willed the flames to dissipate.</p>

<p>She followed Willow's gaze as the red head looked down at her still sleeping
lover and gently ran a finger over the partially healed wounds.</p>

<p>&#34;It's okay, Will.&#34;  Cordy hesitated just for a second and then placed a
comforting hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>Willow took a deep breath and slowly let it out never taking her eyes off of
her soulmate's tear streaked face.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, yes, it will be,&#34; the young witch said with her resolve face slipping
into place.  &#34;What time is it?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's around three,&#34; Cordelia answered.  &#34;It's okay Willow.&#34; Cordelia told
Willow for a second time patting her shoulder to reassure her that someone
else cared about them.</p>

<p>&#34;Tell you what, you go take a shower and I'll call and reschedule the
fittings then fix you guys some breakfast? How does that sound?&#34; She asked
as she walked over to Buffy, examining the long gashes on her arms.  &#34;Then
I'll help you take care of her.  From taking care of Angel all those times I
became pretty good with a needle and thread.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Sure Cordy,&#34; Willow agreed, still groggy and stunned by her friend's cool
efficiency and obvious concern.</p>

<p>&#34;What did you use to knock her out?&#34; Cordy asked, she needed to know how
much longer the slayer would be asleep.</p>

<p>&#34;Ah, um...&#34; Willow stammered still not firing on all cylinders.  &#34;I used
magic-she should be out for a little while longer, why?&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia straightened and headed towards the kitchen hoping Mrs. Summers had
done some grocery shopping for those two.  Sometimes they were just so
helpless when it came to the every day things of life.</p>

<p>&#34;Because,&#34; the brunette started as she turned back to the confused Witch,
&#34;we can get some food in her, then get her clean and in bed before you zap
her again so we can stitch up those cuts.&#34;</p>

<p>If Cordelia hadn't been so busy the silent &#34;oh&#34; that formed on Willow's
mouth would have been comical.</p>

<p>&#34;Then, I'll...ah...go shower.&#34; And the Witch staggered up the stairs talking
quietly to herself, &#34;Boy when you put Cordy in charge she really takes
charge. Thank the goddess.&#34;</p>

<p>Cordelia couldn't help the smile as the last of her friend's words drifted
down to her.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The entity detached itself from the girl's skirt and flew over to the
nearest picture hanging on the wall.  It would be able to watch the entire
room from this spot and, at the same time, with just a few steps it could
hide behind it.</p>

<p>It was still shaking off the effects of the stupid girl touching the witch's
protections.  No wonder humans were doomed to become slaves-they needed
someone to take care of them all the time. They didn't have enough
intelligence to put in the head of a pin--when they did things like sneaking
up on powerful witches-they shouldn't expect to live.</p>

<p>He sat there watching with the smug knowledge that his Mistress was far
stronger than the little witch was-she would have fried the stupid
brunette-instead of taking orders from her.</p>
