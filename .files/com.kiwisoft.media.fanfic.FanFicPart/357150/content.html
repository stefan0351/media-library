<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 5: Moving and Comforting-->

<P>It finally happened. Things had been going great for almost two weeks, and then a couple students told Principal Snyder about her and Buffy. She didn’t know who told him, but that wasn’t really important to her right now. Because now, they were sitting in his office getting a speech about how it was inappropriate, or something like that. At some point, she and Buffy had grasped hands. </P>
<P>Buffy had told her that he talked for a long time, so Willow let her thoughts wander. She knew where Snyder was coming from, although she completely disagreed with him. He was a man who believed in order. He liked a well-structured society. And in society gays and lesbians just didn’t seem to mix with straight people, so that carried over to school.</P>
<P>But she didn’t consider herself lesbian, although she knew technically she was. It wasn’t that she was in denial, or that she was ashamed to be in love with Buffy. She just thought it was wrong having to be labeled and stuck into a group. To lose herself. She was Willow Rosenberg. That was her name, her identity, but everybody who looked at her thought and saw one thing: ‘lesbian’. </P>
<P> It bothered her to say the least. She had learned to slowly deal with other kids remarks, but the thing was, she knew it didn’t stop when school was over. Adults acted the same way as their kids. Maybe they didn’t approach you and make comments, but they stared at you. She dreaded that day. The day when she was more afraid of people in daylight, then the vampires at night. It’s not like she shouted out over the rooftops that she was in love with her best friend, but she would always look over her shoulder. </P>
<P>The whole categorizing thing was wrong to her. Very wrong. She was pretty sure that before gays were that widely talked about people who were in a male/female relationship weren’t called straight. It was all a big mess. Because gays were just as responsible for the categorizing as the straight people. Like they wanted to separate. Well, Willow told herself she wasn’t going to be sucked in by either group. She would be her, and that’s it. It had gotten her this far.</P>
<P>Gay, straight, or bisexual, they were all people first, right? To make friends now, she didn’t want to have to go up to someone and warn them, ‘I’m a lesbian’. Of course if she didn’t, then she got to know the person, and then told, it would create a problem. She just didn’t get it. What was so wrong? People should be happy for anybody who’s found love, no matter what the couple is like. It was just frustrating.</P>
<I><P>‘Oh well. I think too much anyway.’</P>
</I><P>She focused her attention back on Snyder.</P>
<P>"You can’t do anything. That would be discrimination, and we can sue you for it." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Unfortunately, you’re correct. But in case you don’t know the rules, in my school, you’re not allowed to show any physical affection."</P>
<p>"We haven’t done anything like that."</P>
<p>Willow saw the look in Buffy’s eyes. She wished they could. But again, even though society had no specific law against it, they were pressured by the masses to not show affection in public. Willow sighed.</P>
<p>Snyder pointed to their held hands.</P>
<p>"That’s a sign of friendly support. It’s for when you’re –" Buffy had a remark all set to go, but thought better of it.</P>
<p>"It’s an easy to follow rule."</P>
<p>Buffy glared at him, and started to pull her hand out of Willow’s. Willow decided to make a decision then and there. She gripped Buffy’s hand tighter.</P>
<p>"No." She said simply.</P>
<p>Snyder and Buffy both looked at her like she had grown an extra head. Willow grinned inwardly.</P>
<p>"Buffy’s right. It’s just a gesture of support. It’s not like were kissing in the hallways."</P>
<p>Snyder grinned.</P>
<p>"Well, Miss Summers, I didn’t think it possible, but you finally corrupted our best student. Such a shame."</P>
<p>"She didn’t corrupt –"</P>
<p>"Miss Rosenberg, normally I would take great pleasure in discipline, but because this is your first offense I’ll be lenient, and leave that to your parents. In this case, I think they could do a much better job than I ever could."</P>
<p>Willow paled.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Willow came out of Snyder’s office, and started making their way to the cafeteria.</P>
<p>"He kept us in there for a whole hour? I missed two classes!" Willow said, fuming.</P>
<p>Buffy chuckled. "You can get the notes from somebody."</P>
<p>"No I can’t. I’m the only one who takes notes. I’m the one people come to for the notes."</P>
<p>"I think you’re just avoiding what he said." Buffy told her gently.</P>
<p>"About him telling my parents? I knew it was going to happen sooner or later. It’ll be okay."</P>
<p>"Willow I can see your face. It’s not an okay face. It’s a ‘I’m pretty sure my parents will blow up and probably disown me’ face."</P>
<p>"You can tell? I thought I was hiding it pretty well."</P>
<p>"I can tell you were trying real hard, though."</P>
<p>Willow smiled weakly.</P>
<p>"Do you want me to come home with you after school?"</P>
<p>"I don’t think you want to do that. You may be super strong and all, but when my father gets mad…"</P>
<p>"If you’re sure that’s what you want."</P>
<p>"For now it is. I have to deal with my parents. It’s gonna be hard, and it probably won’t go very well, considering how religious my family is and stuff, but I need to do this solo."</P>
<p>They entered the cafeteria and went in the line.</P>
<p>"Just remember that if you need me, I’ll rush right over." Buffy smiled at her.</P>
<p>"I will." Willow smiled back.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow flung the duffel bag over her shoulder, looked back at her house, and then walked away. It was just starting to get dark, so she sped up a little. She knew it would go bad, but she never thought it would go this far.</P>
<p>Her father kicked her out. She didn’t think it was possible to hurt as much as she was. The one time she did something they didn’t agree with…she couldn’t believe her father would do that to her.</P>
<p>She kept playing the ‘argument’ back in her mind. She came home, and as soon as she was through the door, the first question was, ‘Is it true?’ Of course, she answered truthfully. She figured if she was honest with them, it would go better. It didn’t.</P>
<p>Her mother, in her infinite knowledge, immediately suggested that she would get her some help. That’s when Willow started yelling defensively, surprising both herself and her mother. Her mother responded by calling Buffy a ‘bad influence’ and ‘trouble’, and that Willow was not to have any more contact with her.</P>
<p>Up until that point, her father had been silent. Calmly, he sat her down, and said he understood what was going on. She was confused, and it was natural for girl her age to be unsure. Then he brought up what she knew was coming all along. Their religion.</P>
<p>Ahead of her on the sidewalk, a vampire jumped out in front of her. Too busy with her own thoughts, she stood there a minute, then spoke.</P>
<p>In an angry voice she said, "Not now." She shoved the vampire as hard as she could off to the side. Not realizing that there was a wooden fence there, she just walked right on, as the vampire turned to dust.</P>
<p>Thinking back again, when her father brought up religion, she froze. He thought that would immediately change her mind, and he started to smile. But she didn’t back down, she said she didn’t agree with him. That’s when he lost it.</P>
<p>Her father was dedicated to their religion. He spent many hours in the local synagogue, and believed staunchly in its teachings. He believed, well to him he knew, that Judaism was against homosexuality. However, she could have pointed out a few passages where it contradicted what he believed, but she was in enough trouble already.</P>
<p>While her father was trying to refrain from screaming, her mother had entered back into the argument. She told Willow that they knew what was best for her. She loved her parents very much, but over the last three years, she had learned a thing or two.</P>
<p>She remembered when she was five, and she thought she saw a monster under her bed. Her parents had rushed into her room, and assured her that monsters weren’t real, and nothing would hurt her. She knew the truth now.</P>
<P> Monsters were real, and they had hurt her. And it wasn’t her parents’ fault, but with monsters, and everything else, she learned to follow her instincts, to believe in herself to make the right decisions. She just wished her parents would believe in her.</P>
<P>Then, her father offered her an ultimatum. Stay away from Buffy Summers or leave the house. She and her mother stood there shocked for a minute. Willow couldn’t stay away from Buffy. It wouldn’t just end ‘them’, but it would end their friendship as well. She couldn’t and wouldn’t do that.</P>
<P>So, she went upstairs gathered some clothes, and her possessions, and then left the house. Her mother begged her to reconsider, and Willow simply told her, "I’m in love. You may not agree with it, but I do. You’ve told me to always follow my heart, and that’s what I’m doing. When you can accept that, well, you probably know where I’ll be."</P>
<P>Knocking on Buffy’s front door, she waited.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy opened the door, and looked her friend up and down. When she saw the duffel bag, she gasped.</P>
<P>"Oh no…" She said quietly.</P>
<P>She moved out of the way, and Willow walked in and shut the door. Dropping the bag to the ground, she fell to her knees, and started to sob.</P>
<P>"Oh Willow…come on, let’s get you to the couch." Wrapping her arm around Willow, she helped her up and over to the couch. Slowly, Willow stopped crying, and looked at Buffy.</P>
<P>"Can I stay here?"</P>
<P>"You know you can but…what happened?"</P>
<P>"I told them I was in love…they didn’t agree…told me to stay away from you, and I couldn’t lose your friendship Buffy. I could deal with losing ‘us’ but never my best friend. They gave me a choice…you or them…and…"</P>
<P>"You chose me?"</P>
<P>Willow nodded.</P>
<P>"You shouldn’t have done that."</P>
<P>"Why not?"</P>
<P>"I’m not worth it. I took you away from your family."</P>
<P>"First, you are worth it, and second, you didn’t take me away from anything. It was my choice. Okay?"</P>
<P>"Okay." Buffy said reluctantly. "I’m sure it’s only temporary, anyway."</P>
<P>"You think?"</P>
<P>"This is a big deal for them. You just need to give them time to realize the big mistake they made. You’re Willow. You’re the greatest person in world, and they may have lost sight of it, but it won’t last long. "</P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P>"Because you’re you."</P>
<P>Willow smiled weakly.</P>
<P>"Why’d your mom take it so easy?"</P>
<P>"Look at it this way. If you found out your daughter was fighting the forces of darkness every night, anything you found out afterwards, would be nothing compared to that. Not to mention a relief."</P>
<P>"Yeah, I guess it would be."</P>
<P>"Listen. Everything is going to be fine. You’ll see."</P>
<P>"Um…were you going to patrol?"</P>
<P>"Yeah."</P>
<P>"Can I come?"</P>
<P>"I don’t know if –"</P>
<P>"I need to not think about this right now. If I stay here, I will."</P>
<P>Buffy nodded, and they got up. She left her mom a note, and they left.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow was watching Buffy slay, but at the same time, she didn’t see a thing. She didn’t even register the vampire that turned to dust a mere foot away from her face. Buffy saw this, and knew Willow didn’t hear the vampire behind her.</P>
<P>Buffy pulled Willow out of the way, and staked it. Turning back to Willow, she spoke.</P>
<P>"Okay, you’re scaring me, Will."</P>
<P>At Buffy’s words, she seemed to snap back to reality.</P>
<P>"What? Oh. I’m fine." She smiled.</P>
<P>Buffy tried to hide her worry.</P>
<I><P>‘Okay. That was a fake smile. She never does that.’</P>
</I><P>They started to walk home.</P>
<I><P>‘This is bad, and I don’t know what to do.’</P>

</I><hr width=100>

<P>When they got in, Joyce was sitting in the living room.</P>
<P>"Hey you two."</P>
<P>"Hi mom."</P>
<P>"Hi Mrs. Summers."</P>
<P>"Oh, Willow, I cleared a space for you in Buffy’s closet. All your clothes are in there."</P>
<P>"Thanks. I’m gonna…" Willow said, pointing to the stairs.</P>
<P>"I’ll be up in a minute."</P>
<P>They watched her go, silent.</P>
<P>"I don’t know what to do, mom."</P>
<P>"I’m sure her parents just need time to adjust. Just be careful."</P>
<P>"Mom, I’m not gonna…"</P>
<P>"No, I mean she needs you. Comfort her, be careful with her."</P>
<P>"And if that doesn’t work?"</P>
<P>They were both silent.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy climbed into her bed, where Willow was already asleep. She could practically feel the tension radiating off Willow’s body. Shifting closer, and wrapping her arms around her, Buffy felt her relax. Thinking Willow was going to be okay for the night, she drifted off to sleep.</P>
<P>Several hours later, she was awoken by the sound of gentle crying. They had shifted positions during the course of the night, because when Buffy opened her eyes, she was face to face with Willow. Wiping the tears off her face, Buffy sat up.</P>
<P>Willow laid her head down in Buffy’s lap, still crying softly. Stroking Willow’s hair, she spoke soothingly.</P>
<P>"It’ll be okay…" She repeated over and over.</P>
<P>Buffy didn’t know how long it took, but eventually Willow fell asleep, her head still in Buffy’s lap. Buffy stayed sitting all night, and tried to make sure she slept peacefully. And Willow did. </P>
