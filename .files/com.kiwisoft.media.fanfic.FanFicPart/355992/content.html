<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Eight -->

<p>That weekend, on a hot Saturday morning, Cassidy drove up to the front of Andrea's house and pressed on the horn. Not more than three minutes passed before Andrea was out the front door, packed up with a large basket and a cloth bag full of three wine bottles. Andy could hardly see above the bulk in her arms. Cassidy smiled as she got out of the car, walking over to the other side and opening the back door to place the items next to the down quilt where they would rest in the open field. Andrea had insisted that she'd provide the foods, and Cassidy would provide the comfort.</p>
		<p>They argued extensively on this, but then Andrea always got what she wanted out of Cassidy; and this time it was to bring the food. Cassidy got stuck with bringing the down comforter, a boom box radio, and some music. She'd looked through her extensive collection, and made tasteful choices of music by women they both liked. Andrea liked the music of Sheryl Crow, Paula Cole, Natalie Imbruglia, and such. Cassidy liked pretty much the same, including K.D. Lang, Indigo Girls, Shawn Colvin, Loreena Mckennit, etc. All in all, they went packed with a bunch of nice relaxing woman-oriented music.</p>
		<p>The sun was beautiful, and there was no sign of rain that day. There had been no warnings or anything. The gigantic yellowish orb was flashing its light upon this part of the world along with a gentle breeze. The weather was no more than seventy-five or eighty degrees, perfectly warm and relaxing. They drove in companionable silence with the convertible's hood down, feeling the breeze caress their faces and their hair gently. They listened to the radio on the way, a soft jazz station that had many followers, including both Andrea and Cassidy.</p>
		<p>They drove for almost two hours before they reached Fountain Woods, the highway was comfortingly deserted and the road was relaxing. It was two o'clock in the afternoon by the time they found their spot of so long ago, setting down their quilt and radio, and food. Cassidy parked about two hundred feet from the grassy spot, and they walked over to their area of comfort. Andrea dove right in for the white wine, taking out of the basket two glass goblets for them. She gave the bottle to Cassidy to open, and then she poured them each the wine. She lay down on the comforter, propping her head on her arm and crossing her shapely legs. She was staring adoringly up at Cassidy, who was working on the music.</p>
		<p>Indigo Girls was her first choice. The music played on low volume, but loud enough for them to hear. Cassidy turned away from the radio and lay down on the comforter also, laying her head on her bent arm and resting the goblet on the ground with her hand. She was a stunning sight to Andrea, who stared unflinchingly at her. Her blacker than black wavy hair was tied back in a soft ponytail, allowing her features to really be seen by Andrea. She wore khaki shorts and white sneakers with no socks, her smooth and muscled legs were a hypnotic sight to Andrea. Her white GAP button down shirt was loose and comfortable, the top four buttons left unbuttoned to reveal her beautiful skin beneath it.</p>
		<p>Andrea was intensely aware of Cassidy's beautiful skin beneath the shirt, the fact that she wore no bra, and of the sensuous languor of her body. In her fascination with Cassidy, she didn't realize that Cassidy's eyes were on her also.</p>
		<p>Unaware of Andrea's own stare, Cassidy took in the shapely beauty of her. She wore her hair in a high ponytail, her graceful and beautiful neck left exposed by the hairstyle. She wore a white cotton tube-top that was tight against her flat stomach and full chest. She wore no bra, and Cassidy could see the darker tint of her nipples. Her shorts were black, and reached above her knees, leaving the unmerciful sight of her lovely and shapely legs to Cassidy. Her pretty, small feet were encased in soft feminine sandals.</p>
		<p>Desire was no stranger to Cassidy when it came to Andrea, but the love that was mingled with it was unbearably intense. She took a sip from the wine, and spoke: "Tell me how school was." Her voice was hoarse, and she cleared her throat.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat up, crossing her legs and resting her elbows against her thighs. She took a sip from her goblet and laughed. "It's always a new experience, every single day." She said, and shook her head. "Two guys got into a fight over Roseanne Mitchell. You remember her?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, remembering the stunning energy and beauty of the Irish young girl. One night, at a dinner, she met Carey Mitchell and her highly energized and sweet young daughter. "Of course I remember." She said softly, gazing at Andrea admiringly.</p>
		<p>Andrea drew a deep breath, feeling warmed all over by Cassidy's gaze. "Roseanne, at this very moment is not interested in men," She said, musing. "For some reason, and I know this is not of her parents' making, she kind of gets crushes on young girls and teachers." She paused, and took a sip from her wine. "Well, anyway, these two guys start fighting right in front of her. And I mean fist fighting, really going at each other's throats. Mind you, they're football players. Roseanne surprises every body by running up to them and pulling one off the other by the hair. These are big guys, too." Andrea began laughing, remembering the whole scene.</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed along with her, imagining Roseanne's small form pulling a huge football player off another.</p>
		<p>"So the other guy thinks she did this because she liked him better than the other," Andrea continued with a smile. "And he goes up to her ready for a big romantic kiss. She looks at him as if he were stupid or retarded or something, and tells him: 'Get off me, you big idiot!'" Andrea did a perfect imitation of Roseanne and her small Irish accent. "'Can't you see I have the biggest crush on Manuela Montero? Jesus, you guys are stupid!' And walks away from him as if he were a piece of garbage or something, with a look of disgust that was hilarious." She began to laugh again. "Meanwhile, everybody's just staring at Manuela in surprise. And she's blushing like a tomato, and smiling from here to New York City. Seems she has a little crush on Roseanne too."</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed raucously, she could picture Roseanne doing all of this to the poor guy. "That Roseanne is just something out of the ordinary." She finally gasped. She took a mouthful from her goblet and finished the wine. Already she was feeling lightheaded. A song she liked from the Indigo Girls, named 'Caramia' came on. She smiled at Andrea and turned up the volume. She sat up and began to sing along with the sad song, her voice perfectly matching with that of the singers. She closed her eyes. "'...why are you dreaming this, one shoe off and a bridge to cross over...'"</p>
		<p>Andrea studied her with wide eyes. She was so beautiful, she couldn't take her eyes away from her. "'...and there's a sea full of faces and show to go on, and I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from...'" Cassidy's voice was sultry, sensuous, no strain was necessary to reach those cords. Andrea felt her heart swell, her body calling for Cassidy's. She wanted to dance with her, to feel her close again. She stood up, and stared down at her, extending her hand.</p>
		<p>Cassidy seemed to sense her movement through her concentration. She opened her eyes slowly and looked up at Andrea with wondering eyes. Andrea said softly: "Put the song over and sing it while we dance."</p>
		<p>Cassidy was breathless as she got to her feet. She started the song all over, and stepped out of the comforter onto the grass. She took Andrea's much smaller and sweaty hand and pulled her to herself. The song began just as she pulled Andrea into her arms, wrapping one arm around her thin waist and taking her hand with the other. The instruments broke right into the song, and so did they. Cassidy pulled her close, beginning to sway, hypnotized with the song, singing into her ear. Her body was sending such signals to her brain, signals that tortured her. She was aware of the pressure of Andrea's breasts against hers, of her pelvis pressing against her abdomen, her thighs pressing against hers. She didn't know what to do, how to control her rising arousal.</p>
		<p>She swayed their hips together just as she sang a verse that was accompanied by the beautiful sounds of violins. "'...and there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on, and I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from...'" Her voice gained power in this part, but it didn't bother Andrea at all. It sent a powerful sensation through her, a sensation she couldn't identify. She felt the soft rise and fall of Cassidy's breasts as she sang.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed against Cassidy's neck, feeling the feathery caresses of Cassidy's breath and voice against her ear. She let herself be guided by Cassidy's body, by her hands, aware of a deep feeling in her heart, a feeling that was surfacing as they danced. She picked up her hand from Cassidy's shoulder and placed it behind her head, pulling her head down closer against her ear, wanting to hear her heavenly voice forever. The end of the song came, and she didn't want to let go of her, she didn't want Cassidy to let go either. And when Cassidy tried to pull away, she wrapped both arms around her shoulders and pulled her closer.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't breathe, her feelings were so intense. The love, the desire.</p>
		<p>"Don't let me go, Cassidy, please!" Andrea gasped, not able to stop herself, wanting her close. She moaned helplessly. "Please..."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes against the feeling, and pulled away, removing Andrea's arms from around her neck tenderly. She held them down against Andrea's body and gazed at her with anguish. Andrea gazed up into her eyes, staring at the reflection of the sunlight against the golden brown of them. "Andrea," Cassidy whispered with feeling, she closed her eyes. After a long moment, she let go of her and turned away.</p>
		<p>Andrea closed her eyes and sat down on the comforter. Turning towards the wine bottle, she took hold of it and poured more wine into both goblets. Cassidy walked a few feet away from her and sat down on the grass, laying back and covering her eyes with both arms. Andrea listened to the other songs playing on the radio, her head full of static and jumbled thoughts and passion. The CD reached its end over a half-hour later, and Cassidy was still laying a few feet away from the comforter. Andrea stared out at her, her knees pulled up and her arms wrapped around them.</p>
		<p>Finally, Cassidy sat up, bending her knees up and resting her forehead against them. She let her arms hang limply at her sides. She stood up after a few minutes and went back to the comforter. She sat down and stared at Andrea with wonder in her eyes. "This was all the wine, Andrea." She said, trying to explain to herself what had just happened.</p>
		<p>Andrea shook her head slowly, and looked down at her feet. "I don't think so, Cassidy." She said softly, so softly that Cassidy had to lean forward to hear her. The sight of the long graceful neck sent a shiver through Andrea.</p>
		<p>Cassidy pulled back and looked down pensively at the comforter. Suddenly, she said: "Let's just forget it, okay?" She reached for the basket, and brought out the cheese, bread and mayonnaise. She glanced up at Andrea, and it was as if nothing had happened between them just an hour before. Andrea felt very hurt; that Cassidy could dismiss what had just happened so easily. "Want a sandwich?" Cassidy asked nonchalantly.</p>
		<p>Andrea stared at her with hurt in her eyes, but Cassidy numbed her body against what she thought she saw, she didn't want to be mistaken. Finally, Andrea nodded, deciding to forget about it too if Cassidy was so quick to forget. "Ham and Cheese, no Mayo." She directed lightly, and watched as Cassidy prepared her sandwich with graceful fingers. Fingers she wished were running through her hair, touching her skin softly... She threw her head back and sighed, then looked down to see Cassidy still worrying about the sandwiches.</p>
