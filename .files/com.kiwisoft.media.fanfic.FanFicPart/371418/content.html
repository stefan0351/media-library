<p>A/N- YAY! Last chapter, I made it! (who knew, right?) Thanks for those who've been with the story since the beginning. And to those of you who've just stumbled upon this story just now, well, lucky for you peoples! Cuz I made an hour an a half movie last for more than twenty one months, gah! (hides from the prospect of another long story) Anyway, I hope you find this ending satisfactory either way :)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Olivia frowned down at the package where a large wheel of gouda cheese was resting on her bed, having just been delivered to her from her girlfriend, Viola. Her perplexed eyes made their way back to Sebastian, who had delivered the package to her. "I don't get it, this must be out of context." Olivia said, confused in regards to what the over-sized tub of cheese could possibly mean to her.</p>
<p>Sebastian turned back to face her after having been caught looking around curiously at the girl's room. "Uhhh... Actually I have no idea what I just delivered." Sebastian rubbed the back of his head bashfully. "I did it in exchange for all the numbers she got from other girls while she was pretending to be me." he revealed, looking rather proud of himself even if it wasn't him who had received the numbers. Olivia sighed. She'd just have to ask Viola later why the heck she sent her... cheese. She looked over the rest of the package and there didn't seem to be anything else present.</p>
<p><i>'That's weird</i>' she thought to herself. Then another thought struck her with horror. <i>'What if Viola was trying to be romantic and I don't understand the hidden romantic message?</i>'</p>
<p>"Sebastian!" she called out a bit louder than she intended, startling him. "Viola didn't say anything at all about this?" Olivia asked worriedly. If she couldn't understand a romantic message, than what kind of girlfriend was she?</p>
<p>"Uhh, no." Sebastian replied distractedly, spotting two girls walking past the open doorway who giggled when they saw him.</p>
<p>Olivia bit her lip anxiously. What was Viola trying to tell her? Luckily they were both scheduled for tonight's Debutant event that marks the beginning of their ladyship or something or another. Viola called the whole thing "Nonsense mumbo-jumbo. Lets make out!" but Olivia herself was very excited. Besides she hadn't seen Viola in a dress since the Fair, and before that since the first day they met.</p>
<p>Olivia became so absorbed in her memories that she didn't notice the un-ladylike goofy grin adorning her face as she stared past Sebastian, entirely becoming unaware of her surroundings. The young man himself started waving a hand in front of her face to snap her out of it. She didn't seem to notice and sighed happily to herself instead. Sebastian took the opportunity to dismiss himself and see about those girls he spotted. Olivia finally snapped out of her reverie and registered that Sebastian's presence no longer lingered in her tiny room. She sighed and peered out of her window.</p>
<p>And she spotted something in the tree by her window rustling the leaves. She looked closer in suspicion. A camera lens glinted in the sunlight from a particularly thick cluster of branches pointing right at her window. Olivia immediately became ticked and opened the window to lean out and yell "MALCOLM! THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOU OUT THERE, YOU'RE DEAD!" she screamed at the tree. The rustling became even more frantic. So Olivia grabbed the first thing that looked like it could cause some damage and hurled it out the window with surprising strength and accuracy. There was a heavy 'thunk' sound coincided with a male shriek of pain. Then she spotted Malcolm falling from his perch and hitting every branch on the way down. The stalker burst into unmanly tears and ran away.</p>
<p>"YEAH, RUN AWAY BEFORE MY GIRLFRIEND KICKS YOUR ASS!" She punctuated the statement by slamming her window closed, either ignoring the stares she received from the other people who had been milling about outside, or not noticing at all.</p>
<p>Olivia felt very satisfied by the conclusion to that storyline. Until she turned to face her room again and noticed that the package Viola sent to her was now empty. And that what she had used as a weapon against Malcolm had been that huge hunk of cheese that may or may not have been a secret romantic message meant for her. '<i>Crap</i>.'</p>
<p>.-.-.</p>
<p>That night before the debutante ball, Olivia attempted to make her way through the bustling backstage area in her unreasonable dress. She had to dodge budding girls in frills and thrills and hair and makeup. Olivia undertook this task with ease and grace, as was expected of her. The fact that she was internally distressing at the fact that she couldn't seem to find Viola anywhere would have never occurred to anyone. They hadn't seen each other all day and Olivia seemed to have developed a craving for the sunny brunette that had her in stitches. Now that she had the real thing, dreams would never suffice in recreating the softness of her skin or the strength in her arms when she held her...</p>
<p>Her thoughts had taken a tendency to get cloudy quickly with thoughts of her beloved, and Olivia spaced out for a moment, causing her to collide with someone. In the tight space, she had managed to bump into Paul's out of place figure amongst the other women.</p>
<p>"Paul!" she said happily, knowing if Paul was there Viola surely wouldn't be too far away. The young man, currently wearing a green and black tux, greeted her happily.</p>
<p>"Olivia, hey! I haven't seen you since you were Viola's fake girlfriend." he said with a teasing grin.</p>
<p>"Real girlfriend now." Olivia replied with a smile. It was impossible not to like Paul. "Speaking of the ever elusive cross-dresser, have you seen her?" the blonde asked hopefully. Paul grinned at her before he gestured behind him with a wave of his hand. She looked curiously over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Mom, you didn't have to apply so much make-up. I look like a suspicious person!" Viola's voice complained.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! You look lovely!"</p>
<p>"You're just lucky I liked this dress..." Viola grumbled, before she spotted Olivia and Paul. "Safety!" she cried out eagerly and hurried over to the two of them. "Olivia, you look hot!" Viola commented easily as she kissed the other girl's cheek in greeting.</p>
<p>Olivia blushed really hard at the praise, but mostly at the fact that Viola was looking like a breathtaking princess at the moment. "Thanks... Y-you look good too." Olivia stuttered slightly; suddenly shy when she was finally in Viola's sunny presence.</p>
<p>"You're still in the blushing stage? How cute~" Paul whisper in her ear in a cheeky tone. Olivia stepped on his foot and he barked a laugh before giving the two ladies some space. Viola still seemed to be wrestling slightly with the dress she was in.</p>
<p>"Here, let me." Olivia murmured before she started smoothing her hands over Viola's body to straighten the dress out. It was Viola's turn to blush as the blonde's nimble fingers adjusted to fabric over her now very sensitive skin.</p>
<p>"Um, I was wondering about that package you sent me." Olivia thought about the unusual item she received from Viola earlier that day.</p>
<p>A silly grin spread on Viola's face, the girl looking mighty proud of herself. "I'm so thoughtful, right? Whad'ya think?"</p>
<p>Olivia hesitated in answering. She knew she had to be missing something about this whole cheese thing. "Uhh, I'm not exactly sure what to think?" Olivia said carefully. The silliness of Viola's grin increased a bit.</p>
<p>"You know, Gouda is like my favorite cheese so I sent it to you to be cute and so you can also experience the magic of Gouda." Viola urged Olivia to understand.</p>
<p>Olivia stared at her blankly. "Actually no, I didn't know. I don't think it's ever come up in conversation." she stated sheepishly. She didn't mention how this whole conversation sounded like one huge product placement.</p>
<p>"It didn't?" Viola's smile fell off her face and she looked genuinely shocked. "That's weird; I usually make it a point to mention Gouda at least once a day."</p>
<p>"What are you, a Gouda spokeswoman?" Olivia said under her breath in amusement. You learn something new every day about this girl.</p>
<p>"I guess it is cute, now that I know." Olivia quickly reassured when Viola started looking upset at the fact that she hadn't mentioned Gouda to her yet. She also refrained from mentioning that she had used Viola's cute gesture as a weapon.</p>
<p>Viola looked at her girlfriend thoughtfully for a moment. "You know, I can do better than cute. I should be super romantic and show you something that you would recognize." Viola said meaningfully, taking one of Olivia's hands delicately into her own.</p>
<p>"Wha-?" Olivia started to question before Viola started to pull her towards on of the exit doors. With the determined set of Viola's features, Olivia knew that she wouldn't be able to stop her now.</p>
<p>Viola eagerly pulled her girlfriend behind her. Viola led her out the exit and into the warm night air.</p>
<p>"Are you sure we're supposed to be out here? I'm sure they'll be starting any minute now." Olivia said, though she didn't even think of resisting Viola's tempting guidance.</p>
<p>"No worries. I'm sure there'll be plenty of time to turn into butterflies or whatever." That made Olivia snort in amusement at the mention of them going from caterpillars to butterflies.</p>
<p>They were behind the main building, where a pleasant garden and lake scenery was located surrounded by trees with low-hanging branches. The leaves swayed slightly, greeting the two lovers and embraced them in their cover where they ensured no prying eyes would penetrate. Viola pulled her girl to the water's edge, where the starry night sky and the moon swam on the reflection on the water. Thin mist hung about trees like a curtain. No one was out at the moment, and the setting was just perfect for a secluded romantic rendezvous.</p>
<p>The thoughts of all the possibilities of what Viola wanted to 'show' her nearly made Olivia's head steam. (Because for some reason all the possibilities that popped up were sexual in nature. Not that Olivia was a newly self-discovered pervert or anything!... She blamed Viola's hot bod.)</p>
<p>"Wow, this place looks really nice at night." Olivia appraised as she scoped the place out for flat surfaces.</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" Viola commented while she let go of her girl's hand to look around her, though she was thinking of something else entirely out of Olivia's thought process. "So, you remember this place?" Viola said with a hopeful look.</p>
<p>It took Olivia a moment, but then it clicked. "This is the place we snuck out to the first day we met, a year ago!"</p>
<p>Viola looked extremely pleased that Olivia remembered. "Yeah, can you believe it? At that time we were just newly born caterpillars, now we're going to, like, not be caterpillars or whatever." Viola trailed off, having a hard time remembering the corny speech given to them earlier before. She hadn't been listening.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I remember we stayed here for hours just talking. Then afterward you walked me home." The wistful smile on Olivia's face turned to a frown. "That was the last time I saw until I bumped into you a couple of weeks ago."</p>
<p>Viola rubbed the back of her neck sheepishly. "Sorry about that. I forgot to give you my number."</p>
<p>"Me too." Olivia sighed. That night she had been so happy she had forgotten that she'd have no way to contact the other girl again. A silly mistake on both their parts. "But you know," she said, taking a step closer to the brunette. "Since then, I could never stop thinking about you." Olivia admitted quietly, looking at her shoes.</p>
<p>"I couldn't stop thinking about you either, to be honest." Viola's tone conveyed sincerity, though she hadn't known why she couldn't get the blonde out of her head at the time. Olivia's face lit up at the revelation of that information.</p>
<p>"Really? I'm glad to know that." Olivia said breathlessly, wondering briefly if Viola had also had uncontrollable naughty dreams.</p>
<p>Viola smirked at the expression on Olivia's face that she had come to know as 'Olivia's Naughty Face'. She had come to realize recently that Olivia wore that expression quite often around her. It was unbelievably cute.</p>
<p>"You really got to stop blushing. It's a turn-on." the brunette honestly expressed as she recovered from her musings of Olivia's amusing expressions.</p>
<p>Viola's words merely had the opposite effect on Olivia. "How can I when you won't stop torturing me?" she muttered, unable to stop the fire licking at her cheeks, neck and the tips of her ears.</p>
<p>"Oh, if I'm torturing you just by standing here, I guess I'll just leave," Viola teased, moving to walk away when Olivia grabbed hold of her arm and pulled her back.</p>
<p>"Stay." Olivia insisted, not looking Viola in the eye.</p>
<p>"So, you like to be tortured?" Viola chuckled suggestively.</p>
<p>"Shut up!" Olivia glared at her. Viola started laughing, but suddenly paused when she saw strange movement behind Olivia.</p>
<p>A large and mysterious blob of a shadow through the mist was moving ominously toward them.</p>
<p>"Ohmagawd, a bear." Viola's words clogged her throat from trying to come out at once, testimony of how freaked out she was, clutching Olivia tightly by the arm.</p>
<p>"Quick, hide!" Olivia pushed Viola against the nearest tree and pressed herself as closely as possible to the taller, more athletic and totally scared out of her mind girl with every intention of protecting her with her own body. "Don't worry, I'll protect you." Olivia stated with bravado she didn't exactly feel, but kept the act up.</p>
<p>'<i>Wait, there are no bears here!</i>' Olivia mentally yelled. But the sensations of Viola trembling against her, clutching at her like a teddy bear had the smaller girl shrugging in acceptance of their fate. Whatever the shadow was, she was grateful to it at this moment, (as long as it didn't eat them).</p>
<p>The air seemed to still in an effort to escape the notice of the beast. They heard the heavy foot falls of the mysterious creature destroy innocent blades of grass with each thump. Tree branches parted near the couple, making Olivia attempt to burrow deeper into safety, i.e. getting a face-full of Viola.</p>
<p>Viola's back was digging into the bark of the tree, but she barely noticed as the shadow paused right next to their tree, but out of sight. The duo didn't dare breath or make a sound. After what seemed like an eternity the shadow grunted something about 'sprinklers' and started walking back the way it came. The couple and the area around them breathed a mutual sigh of relief at having escaped with their lives intact.</p>
<p>"Okay, it looks like the, uh- <i>bear</i> is gone." Olivia whispered, reluctantly removing her face from Viola's cleavage. Bears were her new favorite animal.</p>
<p>"Wow, Olivia. You were pretty brave there!" Viola breathed out quietly, still cautious of whatever that shadow was. Probably the enraged spirit of Debutante Past.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, it was nothing." Olivia gave a shaky but brave smile. Olivia was usually against bragging or boasting, especially when nothing was done to warrant such behavior, but her mouth moved without her consent when Viola appraised her with her eyes. "It's not like I haven't wrestled bears before!"</p>
<p>'<i>Shut up, me!</i>' Olivia mentally scolded her praise-seeking self. She wasn't like a guy who showed off for a female; Olivia Lennox was better than that!</p>
<p>"Thanks for the protection." Viola said with a teasing grin, running her nails down the small of Olivia's back, snapping back her attention immediately.</p>
<p>"Anytime." Olivia promptly chucked her previous thought away, than blushed when she realized she was losing her grip on her rationale. Viola giggled girlishly and moved her head forward to brush her cooler cheek against Olivia's heated one.</p>
<p>"I warned you, you gotta stop blushing." Viola's lips teased the shell of Olivia's ear and she shuddered involuntarily against Viola's body, mind going blank.</p>
<p>Her own hands moved of their own accord and trailed them along Viola's hips and sides. She stared at her own hands as if entranced, growing bolder by the second and touching Viola less hesitantly and more confidently. Up her strong back and over her shoulders to trial down her front, gliding over Viola's chest and stomach. She could hear the brunettes breaths hitch in her ear over the drumbeat pounding of her own heart.</p>
<p>Viola's hair tickled her face. And oh God, her scent! Olivia nuzzled the bare skin of Viola's neck and inhaled deeply, trying to keep the light vanilla scent in her lungs as long as possible. It was intoxicating. Viola's breathing was getting notably shallower. She seemed to be just as affected as Olivia, despite not having actually done much. This moment was more intimate than any of their previous experimental kissing.</p>
<p>Olivia grasped Viola's neck lightly and the taller girl tilted her chin up to grant her more access. The act excited Olivia even more and she couldn't resist tasting the silky skin of the soccer player's slender neck. A noise escaped Viola's throat at just the brush of Olivia's lips against her body. The blonde took courage from that and let her tongue peek against the sensitive flesh. Viola's hands clutched at Olivia's shoulders and Olivia licked a torturously slow path of fire up her neck to her jaw line. Goosebumps broke out violently on her whole body when Olivia blew cool air on the shiny layer of saliva she left behind.</p>
<p>"Olivia," her named hissed out of Viola's mouth reverently, not helping the smoky coil of desire tightening her abdomen. Viola's fingers grasped the back of Olivia's head and forced her to her wanting lips. Olivia was more than eager to comply with Viola's wants.</p>
<p>At this moment, the various sprinklers in the surrounding area were woken from their slumber to complete their task. They were beckoned by their master, Big Bear of a Gardener Man, who had checked if anyone was in the area not a couple of minutes before. So the sprinklers went about doing the only thing they knew how to do: Ruin intimate moments between lovers.</p>
<p>Olivia gasped harshly, not at the sensations Viola produced in her, but at the blindingly cold spout of water that just drenched her back.</p>
<p>"Oh snap, the sprinklers!" Viola exclaimed in surprise, having been shielded from the spray by Olivia's body.</p>
<p>"Fucking sprinklers..." Olivia growled most unladylike under her breath as the sprinkler came around for another shot at her. Olivia stayed where she was so Viola would stay dry.</p>
<p>"Olivia, you're getting wet!" Viola said.</p>
<p>"I was… I mean, I am!" Olivia was now starting to shiver slightly. Having that freezing cold water drench her previously heating up body temperature was quite the shock to one's system. It reminded Olivia of when she'd take a cold shower after having a dream that featured things that she had been about to do a minute ago. Olivia violently cursed her luck once again.</p>
<p>Viola pulled Olivia away from the sprinkler's spray they hurriedly dashed as fast as their dresses allowed them too. When they were out of range, the dryer Viola haled the both of them. "You stay here, I'll go get emergency help!" Viola declared before hiking up her dress and quickly disappeared with her athletic speed.</p>
<p>Olivia was left shivering in the dark. "Wet and abandoned. Great." Olivia deadpanned.</p>
<p>Viola was quick in reaching the building's back door. Luckily Paul was already outside, seemingly waiting for her.</p>
<p>"Viola, where have you been, they're about to start! Where's Olivia?"</p>
<p>"Paul, you gotta help me! Olivia is all wet! Do you think I should make her come?" Viola asked in a slightly panicked voice.</p>
<p>Paul appeared absolutely baffled by her questions before he grasped her by the shoulders and looked her straight in the eye with a serious expression. "Do you honestly think I'm the person to be asking about this?" he asked gravely.</p>
<p>Viola was baffled now too. "What? Never mind! The sprinklers got us and now Olivia's dress is ruined!"</p>
<p>"Oh…" Paul looked relieved but he suddenly looked alarmed when Viola's words registered in his brain. "Oh! That's bad!"</p>
<p>"Ya think?" Viola grabbed hold of Paul's hand and started pulling him to where a damp Olivia awaited them.</p>
<p>.-.-.</p>
<p>"And now presenting Monique Esquire escorted by Justin Drayton." Cheryl announced into the microphone with as much as grace as she could muster after having downed a few glasses of wine. Hey, she was finally getting rid of this troublesome bunch of girls, she was allowed to celebrate!</p>
<p>"Olivia Lennox escorted by Sebastian Hastings." The spotlight focused on… nobody. The crowd hesitated in their applause while Cheryl looked like might have a heart attack. She certainly did not expect this from one of her best debutants! She supposed that Olivia had gotten into more trouble since she started hanging around the Hastings sister.</p>
<p>"Um, let's move on!" Cheryl tried to make her laugh sound natural and failed. She cleared her throat and moved on to the next pair of names on her index card and had to refrain from cringing.</p>
<p>"Viola Hastings escorted by Paul Antonio." Again, the stage was empty. "Where are these girls?" the woman hissed behind her. "Well, find them!" she whispered angrily when no good response answered her question. She paused when the audience suddenly lit up with applause, exclamations of surprise and laughter. When Cheryl glanced up on the stage she nearly passed out from shock.</p>
<p>Viola Hastings and Olivia Lennox were walking down the stage arm in arm. The sight itself wouldn't have been so shocking to Cheryl if Olivia hadn't been wearing a tux.</p>
<p>Olivia thought her face would pop from embarrassment as Viola practically dragged her up on stage and into everyone's line of sight.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, you look dashing!" Viola had repeatedly reassured her on their way here. Paul had graciously undressed himself and lent Olivia his clothes when they met up. Olivia had struggled and resisted as much as she could when forced out of her own soaked dress and into the shirt, vest and jacket. Viola had thought it was a great idea. The outfit had been too big for her, but Paul was a God at adjustments. He had made Viola into Sebastian, after all. Lucky her.</p>
<p>'Role reversal, much?' Olivia thought mortifyingly to herself as the audience whistled and made teasing catcalls at the pair. 'Here I am, graduating as a Lady… in a tux!' Olivia's head exploded.</p>
<p>"Hey, try to walk on your own!" Viola whispered to her when Olivia slumped dramatically against the taller girl. Olivia straightened up as much as she could and continued escorting her girlfriend up the stage. "Don't worry about it, just try and enjoy this!" Viola nudged Olivia in encouragement.</p>
<p>Olivia looked incredulously at her. "How can I possibly enjoy this?" she whispered back in distress.</p>
<p>Viola sighed and stopped their progress up the stage. "Like this." she answered, swooping down to capture Olivia's lips with her own in a passionate on-stage kiss for everyone to see. The crowd below them started cheering even louder.</p>
<p>Fireworks were still going off in Olivia's head when Viola released her mouth from her delicious torture. Feeling slightly giddy when they turned around to face the audience she raised her fist and whooped with the crowd, making Viola laugh as they stepped down off the stage.</p>
<p>"You the man" Viola said teasingly as they made their way to a table where Duke, Sebastian and the rest of the soccer team and their dates were seated.</p>
<p>Olivia glared at her while blushing simultaneously. "Shut up."</p>
<p>THE END</p>
