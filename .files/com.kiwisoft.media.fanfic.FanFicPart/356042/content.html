<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Eleven -->

<p>Terri jumped, frightened, when the bell rang. She stood up from her perch on the couch and looked at the door as if it were an enemy. She couldn't imagine who could be visiting this late. Noemí would have her own key. "Who is it?" She called out tentatively.</p>
		<p>"Victoria," Came the muffled answer.</p>
		<p>She recognized Victoria's voice and sighed with relief. She opened the door, and allowed her in, followed by another woman. The woman stared at her as she walked in behind Victoria, seemingly assessing her. "Terri, this is Michaela. Michaela, this is Terri." Victoria introduced distractedly. Terri nodded at her, not knowing if she would even shake her hand, she looked so snobbish. "Terri," Victoria said, not noticing the long look Michaela gave Terri in her worry. "You haven't heard anything?"</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head, and moved away from Michaela, for some reason feeling uncomfortable around her. "Can you tell me what is going on, Victoria?" She asked quietly, and gestured them to sit down. "Can you tell me why Noemí is so violent?"</p>
		<p>Victoria nodded and looked towards the kitchen. "Why don't we go into the kitchen, drink something fresh?" She suggested, preparing her mind to tell the story. Terri followed her into the kitchen, and they sat at the table, a glass of cold orange juice in front of each woman. Victoria sighed and began to tell Terri about Noemí and Amelia and the baby, the accident, and lastly the death of Amelia and the baby. "Next week is the anniversary of her Amelia's death?" She trailed off.</p>
		<p>By the time she finished, Terri fought tears of sympathy, her lips trembling, and she looked away. She couldn't imagine what Noemí must feel every time she remembered her pregnant lover, especially since she loved her so much. "How far along was she, Victoria?" She choked out, lifting the cup to her lips and forcing down a mouthful of juice.</p>
		<p>Victoria looked at the glass clutched in her hand and answered in a choked whisper: "Seven months."</p>
		<p>Michaela reached over and stroked the hand clenched into a fist with gentle nails.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes filled with tears, and she couldn't hold them back when they came. The more she knew about Noemí's pain, the more she cared about her, and the more she worried. "It was almost a reality." She whispered, and stood up suddenly. She left the kitchen, leaving Michaela and Victoria to look after her.</p>
		<p>They stood and followed her after a couple of minutes, curious and apprehensive. They didn't find her in the living room and Victoria guided Michaela down the long hallway to Terri's bedroom. Terri, sitting at the head of her bed, legs crossed, had a pad on her lap, a pencil in her thin fingers. Sketching quickly, her hand moved gracefully over the paper, the lead making a slight scratching sound in the silence. "What-" Michaela began, but Victoria gestured her to be quiet. She watched as Victoria walked away from her and around the bed towards Terri. She looked over her shoulder cautiously, and gasped at what she saw.</p>
		<p>Terri stopped, and looked up at her. "It comforts me, to draw and paint." She said in a whisper. "Knowing what has happened to Noemí makes me very sad. And I always painted when I was sad," She smiled ruefully and Victoria returned her smile with a squeeze of her shoulder. Terri continued: "Which explains all the paintings in my old place." She pointed at all the unopened canvases and box of paints. "Noemí had her mother buy me all of this, and I don't even know where to start. She's a very good person."</p>
		<p>Victoria smiled. "Noemí's got the heart of an angel." She said, and sat beside her on the bed. She gestured to Michaela, and she sat on the other corner of the bed. "When she loves, she loves for real. She won't say I love you unless she really feels it." She smiled at Michaela. "Can she see it?" She asked Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri blushed, and passed the notepad over to Michaela.</p>
		<p>Michaela smiled as she saw what she had drawn in a matter of seconds. She'd seen a picture of Noemí in Victoria's apartment, and recognized her. Terri's talent went beyond words; her definition of Noemí was perfect. "This is wonderful. How can you remember every single detail of her features?" She asked in wonder, seeing the same deep sadness she'd seen in the photographs.</p>
		<p>Terri looked down at the bed. "I've studied her," She answered in a low voice. "She is a very beautiful sight." Victoria agreed with a sound, and Michaela had to agree with her. "I've never painted a person before, and when I told her I wanted to paint her, to see what was inside her, she almost had an attack of the nerves. Now I know why, she doesn't want me to see the pain deep within her. But I saw it anyway, the first time I met her."</p>
		<p>Victoria rested her chin against her shoulder, smiling at Michaela, seeing her self-controlled attitude, however temporarily, baffled pleased her. Michaela's eyes were still on the drawing, and when she handed it back to Terri, a grudging respect had replaced the caution in her eyes. "It is wonderful," She said. "If you decide to make that painting, don't forget to let me see it."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and closed the notepad. "I worry about where she is at this time of the night." She said softly, throwing the pad towards the foot of the bed. She felt comfortable with Victoria's bulk next to her, and now with Michaela.</p>
		<p>"She needs a rest; she doesn't take a break from that dreadful office." Victoria said. "Ever since she was able to go back to work, she has been in that office all day, and half the night if I don't get her out of there." She hugged her to herself and kissed her cheek. "We're going, now, you need all your rest, my pregnant friend." She chuckled softly and stood up from the bed. She looked at Terri for a long time, a smile on her face. "Wait until Noemí starts letting you close, you'll see how good she can be. You won't even think about her bad moments, only when they happen. You'll see."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled back and nodded. "I've seen her good side already, Victoria, and I know that she doesn't mean what she says when she's angry. People just have to know what boundaries to cross with her." She said. "I'm learning them as we go." She paused and looked down at the bed. "Don't worry, I'll call you as soon as she gets home."</p>
		<p>"Thanks." Victoria said, and Terri guided her and Michaela to the door. Victoria leaned down to hug Terri and Michaela shook her hand with a genuine smile.</p>
		<p>Terri went to bed and stayed awake for most of the night, drawing in her pad and thinking.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Noemí opened her eyes slowly, lifting her head. She had a slight headache, and her eyes felt a little gritty. The bed she slept in felt unfamiliar, though she recognized the redheaded nude woman sleeping languidly on her stomach beside her. Noemí looked away, remembering the long hours spent with Melanie, the passion with which they had shared their bodies. Careful not to wake Melanie, Noemí sat up and brought her legs over the side, standing up.</p>
		<p>Glancing at Melanie's bedside clock, she saw that it was close to three in the morning now. She padded towards the bathroom, wondering how long she slept for; she knew she didn't feel rested or at ease. "I need a drink." She whispered huskily to her hollow-eyed reflection in the mirror. With her hands grasping the sides of the sink, she leaned forward, closing her eyes. She thought of Melanie.</p>
		<p>She and Melanie had been lovers during their years in the same private High School, and through their first year of college. They'd parted slowly, seeing each other occasionally, then not at all. Noemí had begun to see other women halfway through that first year, so she didn't really mind their breakup. They would always be friends, even if they didn't see each other or do friendly things. She never expected to run into Melanie again, or for this to happen.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong, baby?" Melanie's gentle voice snapped her out of her thoughts and she opened her eyes. Their eyes met through their reflections in the mirror.</p>
		<p>Noemí didn't reply right away, and Melanie waited, her sad expression showing her knowledge of what Noemí's next words would be.</p>
		<p>"We can't do this again." Noemí said, her voice husky and raw.</p>
		<p>Melanie looked away, her eyes filled with pain. She leaned heavily against the doorframe. "Why?" She asked, her voice shaking slightly.</p>
		<p>Noemí looked down at her hands. "I can't love you." She said, her voice full of regret.</p>
		<p>Melanie nodded, biting her lower lip and trying not to cry. "I should have never brought you here." She whispered, her eyes watering.</p>
		<p>Noemí took that as her cue to leave, and she turned from the sink and walked past Melanie, gathering her clothes and slipping them on. Done, she turned to look at Melanie, who now watched her. "I'm sorry." She said, not knowing how to fix things.</p>
		<p>Melanie pointed towards the door and whispered: "Just go." She then began to cry, spun into the bathroom, slamming the door between them.</p>
		<p>Noemí held back tears, guilt tearing her inside. She left quietly and made her way out of the building. She knew she left her car in the parking garage near Friday's and she walked slowly in the direction of the restaurant. She paused in front of Friday's, glancing across the street at the bar and thinking about how thirsty she felt. She crossed the street and walked into the bar. Still in full swing, the bar's music pounded through her. The music played and people were either chatting away at the tables or at the bar, drinking. She saw an empty stool at the bar and moved towards it. Sitting down, she motioned to the bartender. "Whiskey, double." She said, and he smiled as he served her drink. She thanked him and told him to keep them coming.</p>
		<p>She stayed for a couple of hours and drank until the early hours of the morning, when the sunrise already had passed. She stumbled out of the bar across the street to the parking lot and eventually made it to her car.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She wondered how she made it home, really. She knew she shouldn't have been driving in her state, but she didn't really care. She swerved into her drive. Stumbling out of her car and slamming the door closed, she staggered towards the front door. She got it open after some fumbling and cursing, and made a beeline for her liquor cabinet.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>When Terri finally allowed sleep to overtake her, the sun already lit the sky. She didn't sleep more than two hours before she heard the sound of keys clinking against the front door's knob, half-asleep. A thudding sound made her jump and the front door slammed shut, and then she heard a low curse. She recognized the voice, and got up from her bed. "Noemí." She called out, and heard the sound of glass clashing on glass.</p>
		<p>"Go back to bed, Terri." Noemí's hoarse voice called back, her words slurred a little. Terri didn't listen, and walked into the living room. Noemí stood in the center of the living room, a glass full of Brandy in her hand; her hair a tousled mess, her clothes wrinkled. Terri could see on her neck dark marks and knew they were hickeys. Her eyes had that haunted look from yesterday as they stared at her, unfocused. "I said go back to bed, Terri." She whispered softly, and drank from her glass.</p>
		<p>"Where have you been?" Terri asked her.</p>
		<p>Noemí made a face and turned away from her. "None of your concern." She responded in a harsh quiet voice.</p>
		<p>Terri remained calm, knowing Noemí's state of mind, her drunkenness. She said as calmly as she could: "Your family has been concerned, your best friend too. Everybody has been going crazy wondering where and how you were-"</p>
		<p>"Mind your fucking business, Terri." Noemí said coldly, swaying on her feet.</p>
		<p>"Noemí," Terri said pleadingly, moving closer to her. "You've been good to me, and I care about you. You have to talk-"</p>
		<p>"Shut up, shut up!" Noemí roared and spun around, hurled the glass, sending it flying across the room at Terri. It landed with a shatter on the wall next to her head.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes closed in fright; Terri felt the warm liquid prickle her arm and her neck, heard the shattering sound like a bomb in her ears. Her eyes wide with fear, she spun and ran down the hall and into her room, ignoring Noemí's pleading voice, slamming the door closed. She leaned against the door, eyes wide, her body shaking. Her breaths came in short gasps. She cried out feebly when Noemí pounded on her door, hugging herself and trembling. She could hear her say something, but fear didn't allow her understand.</p>
		<p>"Please, Terri, open the door." Noemí pleaded, pounding on the door. "Are you hurt? Please, Terri!"</p>
		<p>Terri felt the baby inside her shift nervously, and she gasped when tears ran down her cheeks. The baby kicked again, and she hugged her stomach, trying to calm down for her baby's sake. Again, Noemí pounded on the door, and she felt the vibration against her back. "Terri, oh God, are you okay?" Noemí yelled out frantically, tears in her voice, the words becoming clear to Terri's ears. "Please, I didn't mean to hurt you!" She sobbed loudly and Terri could hear her body sliding downwards and heavily against the door. Her voice sounded closer to Terri's ear in her pleading. "Oh God, help me, please! I didn't want to hurt her! Oh God!" She banged on the door again.</p>
		<p>Terri moved away from the door and reached for the knob. She opened the door, and Noemí fell into the room, looking up at her through glazed, tearful eyes. "Oh, thank God!" She gasped, and her head fell onto the carpet. She pulled her knees up, hugging her legs to her chest, burying her face into her knees. Her body heaved and trembled violently as she cried. Crawling close to her side, Terri tentatively touched her shoulder. Instinctively, Noemí unwound her body and crawled onto her, wrapping her arms around her waist and pressing her face to her stomach. The baby shifted again, and Noemí felt it against her face. "I'm sorry, Terri, I'm so sorry. I don't know what's come over me." She whispered against her stomach. Somewhere in the house, Terri heard the phone ring. Neither woman moved to answer it and it continued to ring.</p>
		<p>Terri looked down at her and a sudden rush of tenderness surprised her. She smoothed her hair away from her forehead, and smiled softly, the fear suddenly gone. "I know what's come over you." She whispered, and Noemí turned her face to look at her with her one good eye, the other pressed closed against her stomach. "You have to talk about it, you know, or you'll be like this for the rest of your life." She said.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned her face into her stomach again, and said, sounding suddenly sober: "I didn't want to hurt you, I don't know what's come over me." Her arms around Terri's waist tightened and then suddenly loosened. She took a deep breath and she registered Terri's scent; like sweet strawberries in summer. "Are you hurt?" She asked suddenly, sitting up and touching her cheek and gazing at her, her eyes red-rimmed. "Please, tell me the truth. Are you hurt?" She seemed frantic for reassurance.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and smiled, taking her hand in hers and pulling it away from her face. "I'm fine, I'm telling you the truth." She whispered, and then paused, considering. "Well, my feelings are a little hurt. But I don't lie, never have." She reassured her. "We were all worried about you."</p>
		<p>Noemí sighed, and held Terri's hand in hers. "I stayed at a friend's house, I should have called, but I-" She stopped, her cheeks flushing redder.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes wandered briefly to the marks on her neck. "I know what you were doing, you don't have to tell me." She smiled very softly, and Noemí returned her smile. "Just don't disappear like that, please. Not again." She whispered, her smile fading. "If you feel out of control, just talk to me. I know we've just met, but you've been the one who's helped me with this, with telling your parents. I feel closer to you. You've trusted me by bringing me to your house and giving me more things in two days than what I've had my whole life before this. Why can't you trust me enough to talk to me?"</p>
		<p>Noemí blushed, and moved closer to her, pulling her into an embrace and pressing her face against her shoulder. She felt Terri respond to her embrace. "You know why I'm like this?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, burying her face into her hair, breathing softly, rewarded with the musk scent of Noemí's skin. She said: "Yes, Victoria was here last night, worried sick about you. She brought her friend Michaela with her." She pulled back, and saw the shame in Noemí's eyes. "You've been rude to everybody." She admonished firmly, touching her cheek softly with her hand. Pulling back, she stood and offered her hands to Noemí.</p>
		<p>"Now," She said as Noemí stood up without her help. She pulled her towards the bed, and gestured to a beautiful wooden crib already set up close beside the bed. "Look at what your mother bought me. Isn't it beautiful?" Her smile showed emotion that she was obviously surprised she was feeling. Noemí couldn't help the instant tenderness she felt for Terri. There were bags beside the bed, close to twelve bags full of clothes and other assorted materials. Terri gestured to them and said: "She's gotten me all these maternity clothing. She also got my baby a lot of clothes, no definitive colors, because we don't know if it's a girl or a boy. She says that when I give birth she'll buy me more clothes." She looked up at Noemí with question in her eyes. "Don't you think this is too much?"</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and sat on the bed. "No," She said, eyeing the crib and the bags. "Let her indulge herself, she's always wanted a grandchild, and she's getting her wish, in however an unconventional way." She looked at the crib sadly, and her eyes filled with tears; she sat on the bed slowly. "You know," She croaked after a long moment, fighting against the tears. "Amelia and I didn't even get to buy a crib for the baby."</p>
		<p>Terri moved to her and wrapped her arms around her, holding her close; Noemí bent down and pressed her face against her swelling stomach again, her hands against her lower back pulling her close. "I'm so sorry, Noemí," Terri whispered, running her fingers through her hair. Noemí's shoulders shook as she cried. "I told you that you can talk to me about it, don't keep it all inside." She pulled her head back and tilted it upwards, a finger beneath her chin. "You haven't mourned, have you? You haven't even cried?"</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and avoided her eyes. She had been in a coma after the accident; by the time she woke, Amelia had been buried. "By the time I came out of the coma, Amelia and the baby had been buried for a long time." She whispered.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded to herself, never ceasing to look at Noemí. "Someone told me that tears can be good for the soul." She said softly, moving her hand up to stroke Noemí's soft hair. Terri found herself staring at her softly sensuous lips, wondering briefly what it would be like to kiss them. What is wrong with me? She thought with a small shudder, feeling Noemí's magnetism.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled dreamily, her hands grasping Terri's T-shirt at the sides, her eyes on Terri's lips. "I didn't think you were so sweet, Terri." She whispered, and let her head drop again, her arms wrapping around her waist and pulling her close as she buried her face against her stomach once more, strangely comforted by the warm feeling of life beneath the taut skin.</p>
		<p>Terri hugged her tightly to herself, kneading her shoulders and caressing her hair. After a long time, she said: "Want to talk while you watch me draw? I've developed a sudden urge to draw."</p>
		<p>Noemí pulled away and half-turned to look at the boxed canvases and paints. "When will you use those?" She asked, gesturing to them.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at them. "When I find my muse, since you don't want me to paint you." She explained, and smiled when Noemí blushed. She stroked her cheek, enjoying the closeness that they had developed in a matter of minutes. She bent down and took the notepad lying at the foot of the bed. She climbed onto the bed, and adjusted herself, back against the headboard. She patted the space beside herself. "Come, sit beside me and talk away. Tell me what ails you." She said lightly, knowing that their conversation will be a long one.</p>
		<p>Noemí obeyed, but instead she lay down, her head on her lap. She sighed softly. "I think I'm going to enjoy your stay here, Terri. I'm glad I decided that you move here, and that you finally accepted." She said, her arm wrapping around her legs. Suddenly, she sat up. "Shit, but I have to go to work!" She exclaimed and began to get off the bed.</p>
		<p>Terri grabbed her arm, and pulled her back down, firmly pushing her head back down onto her lap. "They won't miss you for a day." She said simply, and Noemí relaxed again, wrapping her arm around her legs. "I'm going to have to lean my pad against your head when I begin to draw." She said, and Noemí nodded her assent.</p>
