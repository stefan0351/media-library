<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>Sam shook her head as she grabbed her bookbag and left the
house. Brooke was acting stranger and stranger and for the life of her, Sam
could not figure her out. Not that she cared to, really. She was actually trying
to spend less time thinking about Brooke, not more. But after that little
bedroom confrontation, Sam was seriously contemplating going back to the house
and taking a cold shower. She was tied up in more knots than a sailor's rope and
just full of unreleased tension. She was fine up until Brooke's personal
lingerie fashion show back there. Now she was right back where she started and
it frustrated her, in more ways than one. </p>
<p>(Well, look on the bright side, Sam. At least you got a free
show out of it) she smiled to herself. And what a show it was. Brooke, strutting
around proudly in her bra and skirt. Little did Brooke know that Sam would have
paid for that little peepshow privilege. Sure she'd seen Brooke in various
stages of undress before but never with as much power as the blonde had
exhibited that morning. Sam had found Brooke's commanding attitude both annoying
and arousing. </p>
<p>(Get your mind out of the gutter, Sam) she scolded herself
with a regretful sigh. (Like Brooke would ever look at you crosseyed. Plus, you
just told her she wasn't your type. Bloody liar!) Sam groaned at herself for her
bald-faced lie. (What isn't your type, Sam? Blonde, blue-eyed and gorgeous or
female?) Her sarcastic side was in rare form today. She snickered. (Ah, Brooke,
if you only knew) </p>
<p>She wondered what Brooke would do if she knew that Sam
fantasied about her. Day and night most of Sam's thoughts were consumed by
thoughts of the tall, lanky blonde cheerleader and the body she hid under that
Glamazon uniform. She figured if that alone wasn't enough to freak Brooke out,
she'd have to mention how most of the fantasies involved the use of warm honey.
(Brooke would probably faint) she giggled to herself. (And if I continue
thinking like this, I'll be in no shape to function at school) </p>
<p>Sam had known she was developing feelings for Brooke long
before their parents ever entered the mix. Boy, that was a HUGE monkey wrench in
her life. She was trying to distance herself from Brooke and her mother was
throwing the object of her affection in her face. It made her want to scream and
laugh at the same time. Her confusion and frustration over how she felt was one
of the reasons she picked fights with Brooke as often as she did. It gave her a
reason to keep Brooke in her face and yet keep her at a distance at the same
time. Brooke fueled Sam's passion like no one else and for a long time that
frightened her. </p>
<p>But after a while, Sam accepted things for what they were,
even if she couldn't have what she wanted, Brooke. She couldn't change who she
was and fighting it only mixed her up. She wished she had someone to talk to but
even her friends seemed like strangers to her lately. This was just something
she had to keep to herself for now. Maybe eventually she'd discuss it with her
mother but not yet. Besides, while her mother might accept her being gay, she'd
flip if she knew that she loved Brooke. </p>
<p>(And there it is in a nutshell) Sam sighed. (I love her and
can never have her because she's Brooke and I'm Sam. Forever separated by virtue
of who we are and our status within the caste. Oh, and then there's the whole
`Brooke's straight' thing too) she snickered. (Can't forget that little fact.
Ohhhh, I hate my life) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke sat down in Chem class and tried desperately not to
look in Sam's direction. She was still wound up like a twist tie from earlier
that morning and knew that another exchange with Sam could spell disaster. But
like her mouth earlier, her eyes did what they felt like and she watched Sam out
of the corner of her eye, idly chewing the end of her pen. She then started to
write something in her notebook and licked her lips unconsciously as Brooke
swallowed a groan. Sam stuck her tongue into her cheek and bit down causing
Brooke to shift uncomfortably in her chair. Brooke wondered if this was anything
like torture in small third world countries because she felt like she was slowly
dying. Sam's unconscious fascination with her tongue was a source of endless
imagining for Brooke. But she knew Chem class was the worst place for it.
</p>
<p>She cleared her throat and shifted again causing Sam to look
at her strangely. </p>
<p>"Feeling OK?" Sam whispered. Brooke nodded not really trusting
her voice. "Okey dokey," Sam responded to the nod. She turned her attention back
to Bio Glass. </p>
<p>"So, my little riffraff, your assignment, should the whim hit
you to actually fulfill your obligation and do any of the work you're assigned,
you moronic and poor excuses for our nations future," Bio Glass droned on. "Is
to write a paper explaining pheromones and their use in the animal kingdom." The
class groaned collectively. "Yeah, like I care what you think. Length is 10
pages and it's due in one week." The bell rang. "Get out of my face."
</p>
<p>Brooke grabbed her books and walked to join Nicole and Mary
Cherry. She cast one last glance in Sam's direction. Sam caught her and for
whatever reason, flashed her a bright smile. Brooke felt her pulse quicken and
her knees turn to jelly. She returned the smile as Nicole grabbed her arm. </p>
<p>"God, what is up with Spam? I swear I'm gonna poke her eyes
out if she doesn't learn to look elsewhere," Nicole snapped. Brooke rolled her
eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"Ah know," Mary Cherry joined in. "If she an' her LOSER
freyands don't stop starin' at us, ah mean ah know we're beautiful an' all but
puh-leez show some restraint y'all?" </p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, shut up," Nicole snapped. Mary Cherry blinked in
surprise and frowned. </p>
<p>"Ah wuz jus' sayin'," she started. Nicole raised her hand palm
up in Mary Cherry's face. </p>
<p>"What did I tell you?" Nicole asked. Mary Cherry sighed. </p>
<p>"Yes, Nic," she sighed. But she vowed one day Nicole Julian
was not going to have Mary Cherry to kick around anymore. She just wasn't sure
when. Brooke looked at the two girls she referred to as friends and wondered if
she suffered from an undiagnosed head injury. She counted as her best friends a
piranna who'd gladly rip the flesh from her bones to serve her own needs and a
slightly psychotic Texan with an axe fetish. </p>
<p>"Guys, they're not doing anything wrong," Brooke argued
softly. "Sam's just being nice. It's a nice change." Nicole looked at her like
she'd suddenly decided to dye her hair pink and call herself `Frenchy'.
</p>
<p>"OK, B, Spam and the word `nice' don't go in the same
sentence, got it? She doesn't even have the word in her vocabulary," Nicole
pointed out snottily. Brooke narrowed her eyes and glared at Nic. </p>
<p>"Cut her some slack, will you? God, Nicole, you barely know
the girl for Christ's sake," she told her. Nicole's eyebrows rose. </p>
<p>"Oh, and you do? Just because you're being forced to play
`Little House on the Palace' with Spam McFearsome doesn't mean I gotta suddenly
like the bitch." Brooke threw her hands up in the air, fed up. </p>
<p>"You know what? If you can't take the bitch panties off for
one second today, Nic, I don't feel like hanging out with you. I'm not in the
mood to march in your `Let's hate Sam' parade so march alone you narrowminded
half-wit!" Brooke stomped off only vaguely aware of why she was so mad. Nicole
stuttered in the wake of Brooke's unexpected outburst. </p>
<p>"I'm not the half-wit! Mary Cherry is!" was the only retort
the usually verbose Nicole could come up with. She didn't know what could have
set Brooke off but chalked it up to PMS. </p>
<p>"Hey!" Mary Cherry piped up. A glare from the enraged Nicole
silenced any further protest from Mary Cherry. </p>
