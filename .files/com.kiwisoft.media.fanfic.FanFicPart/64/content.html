<!-- More Than Words \ Part 1 -->

<P>They were sitting in class, Buffy had just borrowed-all
right stolen-a pen from Willow's back pack and was turning to pay attention to
professor Walsh who was in the middle of a sentence. </P>
<P>"…it's about inspiration. Not the idea but the moment before
the idea when it's total, when it blossoms in your mind and connects to
everything. It's about the thoughts and experiences that we don't have a word
for," Walsh was saying as Buffy clued in. "A demonstration," she said as she
looked around the room. </P>
<P>"Buffy…Summers, come on down to the front here," Walsh said
smiling in a manner that wasn't completely reassuring. </P>
<P>Buffy glanced over at Willow as if there was something the
hacker could do about it. Willow gave her a look that said 'you're on your own
sister'. Buffy slowly rose to her feet and walked down the flat area of the
classroom where professor Walsh was standing. </P>
<P>"A normal girl," Walsh said indicating Buffy. "…one assumes.
Lay down on my desk," she continued. Buffy looked up at her questioningly.
</P>
<P>"What?" Buffy asked uncertainly. </P>
<P>"Go ahead you're perfectly safe," Walsh responded to the
look. </P>
<P>Buffy gave her one last look of uncertainty then walked the
few steps over to the desk hoping onto it, then carefully lifting her legs up
onto it and laying down. Once Buffy was settled Walsh looked around the room
once more her eyes settling on Willow. </P>
<P>"Ms. Rosenberg, would you be so kind as to oblige," Walsh
said after a moment. Buffy turned her head to the side watching Willow's
uncertain approach. Walsh crooked a finger calling Willow over to the side where
she was standing. Once Willow reached her, Walsh leaned over and whispered
something into her ear. </P>
<P>Buffy scrunched her face up in confusion. She didn't
understand what was going on. Did she seriously miss that much when she was
digging around Willow's bag? </P>
<P>Before she had much time to give the situation much more
thought Willow walked away from Walsh and approached her. The hacker walked
slower as she approached the desk until finally she stopped and leaned over the
desk and Buffy along with it. She placed her hand on the other side of Buffy's
body and just stared down at her for a moment. </P>
<P>"This feels very strange," Buffy said shifting her gaze
between Willow and the class. She was enjoying the closeness, she just felt odd
enjoying it in front of the class. </P>
<P>"Don't worry," Willow said with a gentle smile. "Everything
will be fine," she continued. </P>
<P>With that she bent further over the desk until she and Buffy
were nose to nose. Then she closed what little distance was left between them
and brought their lips together. The first touch was brief, their lips barely
brushing each other, but it soon deepened. </P>
<P>"Will," Buffy said softly when the hacker pulled away.
</P>
<P>"Kiss me and I'll make the sun go down," Willow said leaning
back down to capture the Slayers lips. </P>
<P>This time there was no hesitation and Buffy leaned up to
meet Willow's lips. Bringing her hand up to the back of Willow's neck Buffy drew
them closer together deepening the kiss. Professor Walsh, the entire class, they
all faded away leaving them alone in the darkened classroom, aware of no one or
anything but the feel of each other and the sensations coursing between them.
The feel of Willow's lips against hers, the warmth of her body, the feel of it
pressing against hers. Buffy was in heaven, they both were. Heaven on earth.
</P>
<P>"See," Willow said inching back and letting Buffy up.
</P>
<P>"Fortune favors the brave," Buffy said a smile working it's
way across her face. </P>
<P>She was about to say more, but then she heard a flute
playing softly in the distance. It was a sad song and she looked towards the
door. </P>
<P>"Do you hear that?" Buffy asked walking out into the
hallway. </P>
<P>There was singing. "Can't even shout, can't even cry, the
gentlemen are coming tonight. Looking in windows, knocking on doors, they need
to take seven and they might take yours." The singing was coming from a small
girl with long blond hair who was standing at the end of the hallway with a
small wooden box in her arms. "Can't call to mom, can't say a word, you're gonna
die screaming but you won't be heard," she continued. </P>
<P>Buffy stared at her as she sang, trying to figure out what
the lyrics to the song meant. Soon after the girl stopped singing she felt a
hand on her shoulder. It was Willow, she was standing behind her. </P>
<P>She turned around to see if perhaps the hacker could shed
any light on what was happening, but when she turned it wasn't Willow's face she
saw, but the that of a skeleton like man. </P>
<P>Buffy sat up suddenly, eyes blinking rapidly as she tried to
get her breathing under control. It felt like the rays of light were shining
directly into her retina's. Her back was too the window so she knew this to be
an impossibility, but that was still what it felt like. Rubbing her eyes she
threw her legs over the edge of the bed and hoped down. </P>
<P>She shook her head. That dream had been pretty intense.
After casting a brief glance at Willow, she grabbed her bathroom kit and headed
out the door, all the while wondering if the dream had some sort of important
meaning. If it was…what had Giles called it? Prophetic. She was wondering if the
dream was prophetic. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Once in the bathroom Buffy glanced into the mirror briefly
before starting to brush her teeth. Before the dream had gotten all weird she
had been enjoying it immensely. If it was prophetic she wondered if the first
part would come true too. She knew that if she had choose between which half to
go with, it would definitely be part A. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow was just waking up as Buffy re-entered their room.
She still had that sleep haze about her like she wasn't quite awake, and she was
rubbing her eyes. Buffy knew with absolute certainty that she had never seen a
more beautiful sight in all her years of life. Buffy smiled as Willow tossed her
blanket off of her revealing her pink cow pajamas. Buffy had been with her the
day she had bought those. She thought they were cute then, and she still did
now. She also knew that the only person who could wear them and still look sexy
was the red-headed hacker lying five-feet in front of her. </P>
<P>"Good morning," Buffy said smiling. </P>
<P>"Hey," Willow said throwing her legs off the side of the
bed. </P>
<P>They both paused. That wasn't quite right, no sound had come
out. Buffy rubbed her throat and tried again. </P>
<P>"Good morning," she said again. Still nothing. She frowned.
"Do you…can you…" she was getting increasing nervous. No sound was coming out of
her mouth. </P>
<P>Willow stood up. She quite clearly was alarmed. </P>
<P>"Willow, can you hear me?" Buffy asked. There was still no
sound. </P>
<P>"No," Willow answered shaking her head. "I've gone deaf,"
she continued bringing her hand up to her ears. </P>
<P>"No, I don't think so," Buffy said quickly walking over to
her friend. "We can't speak," she continued to mouth while her hands flailed
about. She was now officially in a highly agitated state. </P>
<P>"Ahhhh," Willow mouthed trying to scream. </P>
<P>"Ahhhh," Buffy mouthed copying Willow. </P>
<P>Still nothing. Buffy paused for a moment touching Willow's
arm before heading for the door. Opening it up she looked out in to the hallway.
All the way down there were people trying to talk, scream, anything, and all the
way down they were failing. </P>
<P>Buffy turned around when she felt Willow approaching her.
Willow looked at her questioningly. </P>
<P>"The same," Buffy mouthed to her. Willow's face became
clouded with concern. Buffy immediately reached out taking Willow's hand in
hers. She wanted to bring it up to her lips and kiss away her friends concern,
what she did was simply squeeze her hand reassuringly. </P>
<P>"It'll be alright," Buffy mouthed to her. "I
promise."</P>
