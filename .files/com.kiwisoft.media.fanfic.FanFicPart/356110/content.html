<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 24 -->

<p>After the first battle B'Elanna was moved into Gloucester's regiment of cavalry and Harry was very carefully protected among the archers as he had indeed been recognized as a valuable and talented healer.  Gloucester had been impressed with B'Elanna's skills and bravery and wanted someone near him who he trusted to fight at his back on the chaotic battlefields.  B'Elanna was happy with the change as well for although Gloucester was a silent and taciturn man there was no else she trusted so well at her back in battle.  It took her shoulder more than two weeks to heal sufficiently to return to battle and in that time she was required for many jobs in the regiment, such as helping Harry and the other medics and repairing equipment and arms for the other soldiers.  </p>
<p>As soon as she was healed she was once more thrust into the heat of battle with Gloucester at her side.  Over the course of months countless men were lost and eventually B'Elanna became Gloucester's second in command.  The men learned to trust her implicitly and followed her willingly into battle.  When the soldiers were camped for extended periods of time between battles she and Harry shared a private tent which suited her well as otherwise she was forced to sleep in her clothes for extended periods of time.  She had gotten used to bathing infrequently and wearing the same clothing for weeks at a time.  It was a luxury indeed when they had a night of privacy in which she could remove her clothes and bathe herself thoroughly.</p>
<p>At night when they were camped B'Elanna wrote letters to Annika in which she poured out her heart and thoughts regarding the life she found herself living.  She didn't know if she would ever get a chance to send the letters back to England, but it helped her to feel closer to Annika and so she wrote them faithfully whenever she had the chance.</p>
<p>Several months after she arrived in France B'Elanna found herself once more riding toward Rouen; this time as part of an invading army.  The landscape had been altered since last she came to the fair city.  The trees had been cut down to clear battlefields for combat and to built machines of war and feed the fires that warmed the soldiers at night.  The once beautiful landscape was barren, the ground churned into a sea of mud from the hooves of thousands of horses.  The army made camp outside of the city and made itself ready for the battle ahead. B'Elanna was excited as she had learned from the King's squire that a courier was leaving for London the next day and would carry with him any personal correspondence the officers cared to send.  B'Elanna prepared a bundle of her letters, including several from Harry to Sarah, and gave it to the courier.</p>
<p>Once again B'Elanna found herself at Gloucester's side as they rode into battle.  She had never grown used to the carnage or the sights and sounds of battle, but she was always able to put aside her feelings and perform to the best of her abilities when the need arose.  This day was no different from the others and an hour before dawn she found herself awaiting the command to charge. The battle was bloody and the footing treacherous.  Neither side seemed able to gain ground and forward motion was stalled.  B'Elanna found herself facing several soldiers at once.  She cut down a swordsman and in the moment before she could recover a footman wielding a mace struck her soundly on the helmet.  The headgear was torn from her head and it took her a moment to regain her equilibrium and dispatch her attacker.  Both sides were growing tired with the interminable battle and it looked like once again like the day would end in stalemate. A final desperate wave of the French swept forward and engaged the English troops.  B'Elanna was standing back to back with Gloucester as usual and other than losing her helmet they had come through the day relatively unscathed.  It was in the dying moments of the battle that Gloucester found himself disarmed by French swordsman, B'Elanna came to his defense immediately and managed to protect him while he retrieved his sword from the ground, but in doing so she left herself open to attack from behind.  The first two blows landed harmlessly enough on her armour, but the final blow sliced through her scalp thinly, peeling back the flesh.  She was blinded as her eyes filled with her own blood.  Gloucester was rearmed now and he pushed her to the ground, protecting her with his own body as fought back the French tide. Finally the retreat was sounded and the remaining troops retreated to lick their wounds and prepare for the next day's rematch.</p>
<p>Gloucester pressed his hand to her wound to stem the flow of blood as he called for a stretcher-carrier to bear her body from the battlefield.  Harry was busy tending to the wounded as the litter-bearers brought B'Elanna into the tent.  He cleaned the wound, shaving the hair around the cut so that he might sew it up more cleanly.  The wound would heal and the hair grew back, but when it did it was pure white.  The slash of white ran from her right temple six inches back over her ear, and would mark her appearance for as long as she lived. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Life for Annika in the castle was filled with routine that quickly became tedious for her and for Sarah.  Her life on the road with B'Elanna and the others had rendered her unsuitable for a life lived indoors with other women.  They rose late in the morning and took breakfast together, before attending to duties such as weaving and sewing to fill their hours.  The talk was always of household duties of the wants and needs of their husbands.  Annika found it boring beyond belief and for Sarah it was almost unbearable.  They decided that they needed a break from this routine and determined that they would leave the castle and ride to Sarah's village in the forest for several days in order to escape the tedium of the castle.  </p>
<p>They were free to come and go as they pleased and so they departed for the village only two days after hatching their plan.  They loved being back on the road, and had no trouble setting up their tent and making a fire to cook the food they caught in the forest.  They were very happy to have a sense of freedom again and the days they spent in the village went by all too quickly.  It was with genuine regret that they said their good-byes and began the trip back to the castle in London</p>
<p>That night they lay in their tent talking quietly together when they heard a noise in the woods nearby.  Annika picked up the short sword B'Elanna had left for her to carry with her and motioned Sarah to be quiet as she slipped out the back door of the tent.  She moved as quietly as she could through the forest, hoping to catch a glimpse of the origin of the noise.  To her horror she saw two men moving around the dying embers of the campfire.  Fear lent wings to her feet as she hurried back to the camp.  She saw one of the men enter the tent while the other, who was about to follow, turned at the noise she made as she ran through the woods.</p>
<p>He smiled when he saw a slip of a girl running through the woods toward him carrying a short sword.  'This is going to be fun,' he thought to himself.</p>
<p>"Get away from that tent," she growled.</p>
<p>"Oh come on little one?no need to be testy.  I'll make it good for you."</p>
<p>"You need to get your friend and get out of her before I cut your heart out with this sword," Annika postured trying to sound more confident than she felt.</p>
<p>The rough looking man pulled out his sword, holding it up so that she could see it clearly by the light of the dying fire.  He feinted at her, laughing when she jumped in fright.  Annika forced herself to calm her breathing and remember the things B'Elanna had taught her all those months ago.  She gripped the sword tightly and slashed quickly, cutting him on the face.  The man felt the sting of her blade and became enraged.  He attacked viciously and was surprised when the girl managed to repel his thrusts.  Annika fought desperately, pleased that she was able hold her own against the thug.  Realizing that this wasn't going to be as easy as he thought he stepped back a moment.  She was obviously able to wield a sword, but it was also evident that she wasn't skilled.  He decided to fake her out and have his fun with her once she was disarmed.</p>
<p>Sarah heard noises in the forest and became terrified that something bad was about to happen.  She sat up on her bedroll and was getting ready to leave the tent in search of Annika when the flaps were ripped open and large unshaven man thrust his way inside.  He leered widely when he saw the defenseless young girl alone inside the tent.  He lunged forward and grabbed her roughly, trying to force her back onto the bedroll.  He hadn't counted on the fact that she had spent her life working outdoors at hard physical labour.  She was able to push him back and stop him from grabbing her, but he was bigger than she was and soon she found herself tiring.</p>
<p>Outside, the man feinted one way and then the other in an attempt to throw Annika off balance.  At first it appeared to be working, but then Annika forced herself to calm down and remember the lessons B'Elanna had taught her.  She forced herself to look away from his weapon and from his shoulders and concentrate on his feet.  He feinted to the left and then charged forward.  It would be the last mistake he ever made, as Annika wasn't fooled; he ran straight onto the tip of her sword, bearing them both to the ground and driving the blade cleanly through his body.</p>
<p>Sarah felt herself being pushed onto her back, and she began to panic.  She felt his hands start to pull at her clothes as she wiggled furiously in an attempt to get out from under his foul smelling body.  She was in despair of being able to escape when suddenly the man stiffened and slumped forward lifelessly on top of her with Annika's sword protruding from his back.  She scrambled out from under the body and launched herself out of the tent and away from the horror within.  She screamed as she was greeted with the sight of yet another body lying by the fire.  She threw herself into Annika's arms and the two of them cried for some time before they calmed down enough to assess the situation rationally.  They decided that the wisest course of action was to simply leave right away and return to the castle immediately.  Neither one of them wanted to touch the tent or the bedrolls after what had happened, but they forced themselves to tear down the camp and burn everything.  There was no way they were going to be using any of this equipment again.</p>
<p>When the fire died down they covered the coals and caught the horses in preparation for their return to the city.</p>
<p>"What should we do about them?" Sarah asked, indicated the bodies of the two thieves.</p>
<p>"Let the animals have them," Annika said in a voice tight with anger.</p>
<p>When they returned to the city they could report the incident to the authorities, but as rough justice appeared to have already been served they both doubted the constables would even bother to ride out here to identify the body.  It usually bothered her that the lives of some were held so cheaply while others were valued, but as she looked down on the bodies of the two men she couldn't find it in her heart to mourn them. Two such rough men accosting a woman of noble birth would have been put to death instantly had they survived the encounter, but even so it weighed heavily on Annika's mind that she had been responsible for taking their lives.  She suddenly understood the sad and faraway look she sometimes saw on B'Elanna's face when she thought no one was looking.  It was a terrible thing to take a life, even in self-defense.</p>
<p>They mounted their horses and turned toward the city, riding hard through the night until they were safe within the castle walls.  They spoke briefly with the constable, whose only reaction was to berate them for their foolishness in leaving the castle walls.  As they suspected he had no intention of riding out into the Kings forest to identify two criminals who were already dead.  When she finally got into her room Annika was too busy drawing a bath to scrub away the memories of this night to notice the bundle of letters that was lying on the table in her bedroom.</p>
<p>She awoke the next morning, almost believing for a moment that she had dreamt the events of the night before.  Sarah had been too frightened to sleep in her room alone and so the two of them had shared the bed in Annika's room.  Sarah was still asleep and Annika got up and wandered aimlessly around her rooms.  She spied the bundle of parchment lying on her table and pounced on it with a cry.  She saw the letters in B'Elanna's handwriting addressed to her and her heart began to pound.  Spying the letters that were addressed to Sarah she ran to the bedside and shook her friend awake.  Sarah seized the letters in eager hands and quickly made her way back to her own rooms to read them in private.  Annika clutched the letters to her chest, wanting to read them right away at the same time as she wanted to savour them and draw out the pleasure of reading her wife's words.</p>
<p>She opened the first one with shaking hands and began to read.</p>
<p>My dearest Annika:</p>
<p>I am waiting here in the tent I share with Harry for the trumpet to call us to arms again.  The weather has been cold and rainy since I set foot on this cursed soil.  It seems I haven't seen the sun since last I set my eyes on you my beautiful wife.  My only memory of blue sky is the one I carry in my heart of your eyes.  How I long to gaze into them once more.</p>
<p>This fratricidal war is brutal, slow, and bloody.  When I started out on this path I thought that going off to war would be a great adventure, but I see how wrong I was now.  I thought I had to come to war to find honour, but I see now that honour something you have, not something you earn in battle. I see now that the greatest adventure of all is simply to live!  Something I find I cannot truly do unless you are at my side.  I cannot wait until I can rest my head on your shoulder and feel my heart beat in time with yours.</p>
<p>I cannot believe it has been two months since last I saw your beautiful face.  At night when I lie down and close my eyes it is you I see.  You are my first thought upon waking and the last thing I see before I fall asleep is your beautiful face.  You are my hope and the beacon that is guiding me home.</p>
<p>My body is fighting in France but I left my soul in England and my heart lives always with you my love.  I ache to hold you in my arms again; my lips yearn to touch yours.</p>
<p>I've never been much for dreams, and yet somehow I have found my way to you, something, someone I could never have imagined.  Now I believe in dreams; I know they can come true and now all I do is dream of you and holding you in my arms again.</p>
<p>Never doubt for a moment that I will be returning to you as soon as I am able.  I hear the call to arms and as a soldier I know that I must answer it, but as the one who loves you I would give anything to be able to ignore the trumpet and set my feet back on the road to London, and to you.</p>
<p>Until we are together again, I remain forever yours.  </p>
<p>B. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She held the letter close to her heart as imagined the words being spoken in her wife's voice. She held out as long as she could before she opened the next letter in the pile.  She lasted at least thirty seconds.</p>
<p>My Beloved Wife:</p>
<p>Can it really be four months since I gazed upon your beautiful face? I am fortunate in that I continue to see it every time I close my eyes.  I hope this letter finds you in good health and that life within castle walls agrees with you.  I often try to imagine what you are doing when I have a moment to reflect.  You are never far from my thoughts and you are always in my heart.</p>
<p>You would not believe the changes in Harry over the last few months.  He has become a wonderful healer.  The knowledge he gained from Sarah has stood him in good stead and he is well loved and respected among all of the men.  He has even stitched up the King himself, although the royal surgeon was less than pleased by that I can assure you.  Poor Harry, the two sides of his personality are constantly at odds with one another.  He came here as a soldier, but along the way he became a healer and he finds it difficult to reconcile the two.  He fights because he has to, but in his heart her would prefer to do no harm and concentrate on helping others.  </p>
<p>I have seen such terrible things over the last few months I can't even begin to describe it.  And yet I have seen great kindnesses as well.  I have seen soldiers on both sides rendering aid to one another once the retreat is sounded and the white flag flown.  The war is going ill for both sides.  We gain ground only to lose it again, but slowly we are advancing.  The price we are paying is far too high; the flower of youth will be gone from both England and France if we do not find away to end this senseless slaughter.  I know that there have been talks between both sides, but I am unsure of how far they have progressed.  </p>
<p>I am almost too tired to keep my eyes open and so I will wish you good night.  My dreams are always of you and so I go to sleep with hopes of seeing you soon.</p>
<p>Yours with love</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>Annika no longer pretended she could stop herself from reading the letters right away, so she picked up the next one in the bundle.</p>
<p>Annika my darling</p>
<p>Time moves on apace and yet still I am mired here in the mud of France.  The weather is warming, but still I don't believe that I have been truly warm since I left your arms in England.  My heart aches for home and for you.  There is talk of ending the war, but I'm afraid I still don't know how or when.  I pray to the gods every night that it will be soon.</p>
<p>I am now in command of my own regiment.  I lead men into battle and they follow my every command without question, little knowing how my mind and heart are filled with doubts.  I feel responsible for every man who has fallen under my command and yet I know there is little I can do differently.  Their faces haunt my dreams and I despair of ever finding peaceful rest.  </p>
<p>The King has demanded that the troops treat the French with respect; he has forbidden the soldiers from looting and making profit from our victories.  He hopes to rule a united country and I believe his ideas are sound.  He is an honourable man and demands no less from his troops.  Some of the friends of his youth were caught looting a church in a small village and he did not hesitate to hang them.  Some of the men thought that he was being harsh to treat old friends in this manner, and I could tell that his justice weighed heavily on him.  Still this does not deter some of the rougher men from taking matters into their own hands from time to time.  </p>
<p>Harry caught a man the other day interfering with a young girl in the village.  It is the first time I have ever seen our gentle Harry truly angry.  He beat the man soundly and I believe if I hadn't pulled him off the man he might have beaten him to death.  I never dreamed that I would live to see such things.  I wonder how did I come to be so old so quickly.</p>
<p>I must go now and so I bid you fond farewell.</p>
<p>Yours forever</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>She read eagerly as she sat on her bed, every word making her feel closer to B'Elanna.  All too soon she came to the last letter in the pile.</p>
<p>Beloved Annika</p>
<p>How I have missed you these past months.  I hope you are well.  I wonder if you think of me as often as I think of you. Gods how I long to see you again and hold you in my arms.  I ache for you my love.  When I close my eyes at night I think of you.  I can feel my lips pressed to yours.  If I reach out my hand I can feel your silken skin beneath my fingertips.  I trace the outlines of your full red lips, and pull you close, feeling the length of your body pressed to mine.</p>
<p>Annika brought her hands up to touch her lips in imitation of the actions B'Elanna described in her letter.  She lay back on her bed and continued to read.</p>
<p>I can feel you moving against me, your body tight to mine, the smell of your hair fills my nostrils and I slowly undo the laces of your dress.  </p>
<p>Annika slipped her nightdress off over her head and lay back down to read.</p>
<p>Your skin is so soft and it fills me with joy to be able to feel it beneath my fingers.  Your skin is warm against mine and your lips are hard and soft all at once.  I let my hands trace upward until I cup your beautiful breasts, feeling your nipples grow hard against my palms.  I hear the tiny moans, like the mewling of a kitten, that you make in the back of your throat when you are aroused and I feel my heart beat faster, in time with yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annika's hand slid up to cup her breast and she felt her nipple grow hard in her own palm as she imagined it was B'Elanna who touched her.</p>
<p>I move my hand down between your legs and feel the wetness there, a sign that you are as affected by our touching as I am.  I slip my fingers between the slick, soft folds of skin and tease my way gently to the entrance of your most secret, sacred place.</p>
<p>Annika's hand drifted down between her legs?</p>
<p>I look deeply into your eyes as I gain slow entrance, feeling the heat and moistness of your very centre as you surround me.  I am inside of you now, and I can feel your pulse pounding as I begin to move in time with the beating of your heart, slowly at first, then more quickly until I hear you cry out and feel your body drained of tension, holding you tightly in my arms, as you feel the aftershocks of passion with every fibre of your being.</p>
<p>Annika cried out as the combined effects of B'Elanna's words and her own touch brought her over the edge of passion.  She held the letter tightly in her hand, and it was some time before she was able to read the last few sentences.</p>
<p>I kiss you gently as the racing of your heart slows, and I tell you with look, touch and word that I love you more than you can ever imagine.  I long for the day when I hold you in my arms again, and my body can be where only my thoughts are able to be right now.  </p>
<p>I love you now and always</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>"My warrior poet," Annika said aloud as she pulled the covers back over herself and drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>When Annika awoke several hours later she sat down to write a letter in return for B'Elanna as the courier had left a note with the letters informing her he would be heading back to France the next day.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>B'Elanna dragged her weary body into her tent after another in a seemingly endless number of battles.  Her body ached with weariness and she wanted nothing more than to fall onto her bed and sleep for as long as she was permitted.  She changed her mind in an instant however when she saw a parchment laying on the covers of her bedroll, with her name written upon it in Annika's delicate hand.  She seized the letter in shaking hands and broke the seal eager to read the words inside.</p>
<p>My dearest Beyla</p>
<p>You cannot know how wonderful it was to receive your letters and know that you are alive.  I have never given up hope but after so many months with little or no word I almost began to doubt that I would ever see you again.  My darling it was so wonderful to read your words, to touch something you only recently held in your hands.  I have kissed every inch of the parchments many times over and told myself it was your lips I was feeling beneath my own.  I particularly enjoyed the last letter you wrote. I am sure I will read it many times before you return to me at last.</p>
<p>My heart aches for you and for Harry so far away from home and in such terrible circumstances; I pray every day for your safe return.  When I hold you in my arms again I fear that I will never be able to let you go, nor will I ever be content to let you out of my sight again.  I miss your dear sweet face, and the feeling of your strong arms holding me close.  My darling please return to me, I fear that if you do not my heart will forget how to beat in its sorrow at your absence.  </p>
<p>Life in the castle is safe, but dull, and I long for the day when you return to me and we can once again set out together on the road to wherever our future lies. I know that your situation is a difficult one, and that you are faced with a reality that I cannot even imagine, but know that I am here, every day, thinking of you and loving you and holding you close in my heart.</p>
<p>You told me that you were full of doubts about leading your men into battle and as much as you may doubt it I'm certain that all good leaders are filled with such thoughts as well.  I know that you are brave and true and full of honour and I can think of no one better able to lead these soldiers through the perils of battle than you my love.  I am certain that your men give thanks every day that they are under your command and I know that their trust and their faith in you is not misplaced.</p>
<p>I have very little time as the courier is only waiting until I finish this letter before he returns to France. I wish there was more time for me to tell you all that is in my heart, but know that the courier returns with much more than words scratched on parchment, he returns with my love, my faith, and my heart which will not be returned to me until you are at last safe in my arms.</p>
<p>Yours forever</p>
<p>Annika</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled to herself as she pictured Annika sitting at her desk and writing this letter out.  She was relieved to know that the lengthy separation between them had not altered her wife's feelings for her and that Annika was as anxious to have her return home as she was to do so.  She folded the letter carefully and tucked it inside of her tunic, next to her heart and fell immediately and deeply asleep.</p>
