<!-- Blood \ Chapter 7 -->

<P>B'Elanna Torres felt her fatigue leave her in a rush. Though the truth of the matter was it was replaced as she turned around to see who had entered the Jefferies Tube junction that she was working in. The sight of Seven of Nine was what had sent her pulse to racing, and when the former drone sealed the doors she found the throbbing starting elsewhere. "Seven? What are you doing?" Instead of replying Seven circled, leaning in to sniff at her. An action B'Elanna didn't need because the confined space was carrying Seven's scent to her with every breath. "Seven? Or is it the Son of Kvok again?" The implant arched in the way that was uniquely Seven and her circles drew tighter. "No."</P>
<P>B'Elanna waited several more seconds under the intense scrutiny. "Then what are you doing?" Seven stopped suddenly, directly in front of Torres, which caused the engineer to back up. Seven the spoke. "Evaluating you. You will add to my perfection." Before she was able to consider what that meant she found herself pushed back against the walls as Seven's body pressed up against her. Her body slammed into wall behind them, but it made the softness pressing against her all the more intense. Strong arms wrapped around her waist as her legs threw themselves over the rounded hips of the one holding her. While all that was happening Seven's mouth pressed to hers and she let out a joyous moan as she opened her own mouth and let her tongue glide out to meet Seven's.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's hips found a rhythm as they ground themselves against Seven's ridged abdomen while her own arms rested on Seven's shoulders. Her hands pulled and tugged at the woman's hair bun until it came free allowing B'Elanna to revel in the sensations of running her fingers through the silken tresses. That caused Seven to man as she kissed B'Elanna, and Torres swore she could feel it fill her chest. A sensation that left her breathless, but she found she did not care. She was in a place beyond concerns. Her entire universe was pressed to her chest, holding her tight, kissing her, touching her. The human/klingon hybrid's compact form was pressing back so hard that she seemed to be climbing the taller form holding her. The fingers that had been running through the silken mane slipped lower and found the biosuit's collar.</P>
<P>They pulled and tugged, trying to tear the barrier to the flesh underneath, but the material continued to confound her. The she felt the textured hand grip her firmly while the soft human one reached up to B'Elanna's. The fingers brushed lightly but then found the clasp B'Elanna was not willing to bother looking for. Silently it was released, and as the fabric parted any sound it may have made was lost in the satisfied growl made by the klingon. At this point her human side had decided it was a mistake to deny herself this passion and had finally, perhaps for the first time truly let her klingon side free. The white of her teeth was bared as she tugged the garment to rest at Seven's waist. An action that caused her to feel the hands of her mate cradle her head, the action causing B'Elanna to look up as she purred and reveled in the touch.</P>
<P>Looking up she met the face of her mate. Those infinitely blue eyes met the fire in B'Elanna's and returned it. The smile that curved the full lips was both welcoming and challenging. Torres then turned her head and kissed the inside of the enhanced arm, a kiss that was tender, but insistent. She then whispered deeply. "Mine." The returning whisper was ragged with desire. "Yours." Her hands took hold of the appendage and straightened it, then laying a kiss on the inside of the elbow. "Mine." "Yours." Yet as she heard the reply she felt the not so fully human hand grip her hair with surprising might and pull her head back to meet Seven's eyes. "Mine!" A feral smile crossed the features of B'Elanna Torres. "Yours." There was no resistance as the hands tore open the fastenings of her uniform jacket.</P>
<P>It hit the wall with great force as it was pulled from her and hurled away to fall lifelessly to the floor deck plating. Torres already had her arms stretched well above her as the same hands yanked the under shirt free from her trousers and up over her head. The article of clothing followed a similar flight path to the jacket that proceeded it. Her basic black Starfleet issue bra did not manage as well, Seven deciding she did not have the patience to unfasten the garment and simply used her enhanced hand to rip it to shreds, though it did join the growing pile of clothing. Torres ran her nails down Seven's ribs and the woman shivered in delight. Shivering that stopped abruptly as Torres latched her mouth onto one of the large round nipples before her, and Seven went rigid. When the sucking motion was varied with kisses, licks and the soft scraping of teeth Seven body loosened and a long breath of a moan rattled through her.</P>
<P>Sure hands and deft fingers rested on each side of B'Elanna's head and caressed her cheeks and neck, while keeping her mouth to Seven's breast. Even as she continued to please the nipple she smiled around it while she took one of her free hands to capture the other breast and use her fingers to mimic the actions of her mouth. That caused Seven to cry out and arch into her touch. While Seven's hand tried to keep her head immobile Torres pulled back and stared into Seven's eyes, then wordlessly Torres dropped to her knees. Seven's head flopped back and stared at the ceiling of the Jefferies junction point. Tugging at the form fitting fabric she got it to Seven's knees. Unwilling to bother with it further she left it there and nuzzled the soft thatch of hair at the juncture of those long, tone legs.</P>
<P>Hearing the ragged panting her looked up but kept her cheek to the curls of spun gold. Her hair now free it dangled over Seven's face as she looked down at the klingon. Torres let their eyes speak, and then she craned her neck to put her mouth to the swollen tissues underneath. Seven's legs gave out as she shrieked. All of the hormones pumping through B'Elanna's system included adrenaline and she was able to push her back against the wall and hold her up with out ever breaking contact. Now that Seven was braced Torres became more insistent. Letting her tongue press on the lips, and then using the tip to spread them apart and slide her tongue between them between them.</P>
<P>The clear liquid essence of Seven's ecstasy covered B'Elanna's lips and chin, even causing a drip to run down her neck, and she reveled in it. Concentrating on the lips and surrounds, but also breaking to kiss, suck and even nip at the hardened nub. Seven seemed as frantic as B'Elanna was, grinding her hips against the klingon's face, her body knowing what it needed to find release, and B'Elanna did not deny it to her. Her mouth concentrated on the nub with an unrelenting intensity. Not giving release, but demanding it, and Seven complied. A howl worthy of any klingon burst from Seven's lips and her body started to spasm. Torres broke contact, but if Seven noticed she did not seem to care as she gratefully latched onto the arms that pulled her close. Even as aftershocks shook Seven like small volts of electricity she rested her face to the bare chest of Lieutenant Torres.</P>
<P>When her senses started to return she looked deeply into the brown eyes regarding her with a desire to claim her as her own, and a protectiveness to take care of what belonged to her and protect it from all challengers. It was already an effort to keep her head up in the exhausting aftermath of passion and Seven happily laid back her head and exposed her cheek. At first a kiss tender and warm, then the firm texture of teeth. A source of strength previously unknown to her allowed her to reach up and hold the head of her mate as the teeth pressed harder. It also kept her reaction to a sharp hiss of an intake of breath as the teeth broke the skin. The mouth pulled away and a tender tongue seemed to lap at the wound to clean away the blood.</P>
<P>Seven could feel her lovers nipples harden with intensified arousal at the taste of her blood, and the knowledge gave her a renewed sense of strength that allowed her to roll B'Elanna Torres from her position against Seven's side and lay her flat on her back. Torres attempted to rise, but Seven used her enhanced hand to push her back down. She kept her hand at B'Elanna's abdomen and used her index finger to circle the woman's belly button. At that B'Elanna growled deeply, barring her teeth. Seven grinned wickedly and used her human hand to reach up and the right breast, opposite the side she was sitting on. While she had felt her own nipples harden now that she was exploring B'Elanna's body she found the texture fascinating.</P>
<P>Her thumb circled the highly textured surface while she used her fingernails to circle the surface of the firm globe. Underneath her touch B'Elanna arched her hips so that while Seven's hand had not moved it was still touching lower on her body. Seven grinned as she spoke her voice low and soft. "You are impatient." The burning brown eyes looked up at her. "I've been too patient already." Seven's smile softened at that and her hand moved to the trousers fastening. Her fingers opened it deftly and spread the opening wide to expose the standard issue black panties. Seven could see the damp spot and the scent coming from B'Elanna's growing arousal reached her nose. An answering growl found it's way past her lips and she pressed firmly through the fabric and on B'Elanna's pubic mound.</P>
<P>It was B'Elanna's turn to cry out as she pushed her hips upward. With a smile Seven flattened her hand and pushed Torres back to the deck plating. Once B'Elanna was flat on her back, but wriggling with desire Seven took her hand from caressing B'Elanna's breast and brought it to the waistband of the uniform trousers. She made B'Elanna arch her hips as she pulled the pants and panties down over the woman's hips. In one motion she then pulled them down past B'Elanna hips, her knees, and off. They hit the opposite wall from their mates, but neither woman cared as B'Elanna spread her legs wide. As she did so she watched those wonderful blue eyes get wide and seem locked at a spot down there. The wriggling woman seemed ready to beg Seven to touch her but there was no need as the human hand reached out and touched the spot.</P>
<P>The eyes moved back and seemed concerned as the touch seemed to steal B'Elanna's ability to breathe, but while she seemed concerned it did not stop her from running her fingers through the pooling wetness and warm tissues underneath. As the viscous moisture covered her massaging fingers Torres seemed to regain her ability to breathe, but raggedly. While Seven used some of the knowledge she had researched she let B'Elanna be her teacher as she mimicked the actions B'Elanna had done with her mouth. It seemed to be a success as fresh moisture mixed with the wetness already there. When she finally set out to explore the inside of B'Elanna she gasped as well as the amazing sensation of the tightness, and heat inside B'Elanna overwhelmed her. Blinking several times to clear the dizziness she opened her eyes to see the klingon amazingly still, but looking directly at her with eyes screaming out her need.</P>
<P>A need she answered, she kept the digit probing inside her mate doing so, but faster. While she did that her other fingers massaged the surrounding area and used her thumb to massage B'Elanna's firm, throbbing clitoris. All the actions made B'Elanna scrunch her eyes closed and begin to man a series of mans, each one higher then the next. Each breath she took seeming to catch in her throat before she was able to continue to moan. Suddenly her hips pushed up hard against Seven's hand and locked into position and a howl that far out reached Seven's surged forward. Seven considered withdrawing her finger, but found she was unable to as B'Elanna's vaginal muscles clenched and released too fast and too firm to allow her finger to escape. So Seven continued to massaging, but far more gently, her voice a counterpart, cooing B'Elanna through her climax.</P>
<P>Tears were in B'Elanna's eye as she opened them once more. Now she could see as well as feel Seven's hand withdraw as the taller woman stretched out next to her and snuggled up, but B'Elanna caught her with her eyes as she was half way to the deck and Torres arched her cheek. Even though the blood had dried the wound was still crimson on Seven's cheek with one stream of blood running down her cheek. Seven was on B'Elanna's left side and used her hand to brace her while the opposite one reached out to caress the offered cheek as a confused expression covered her face. "From you, I need the mark from YOU." Seven nodded as the whispered message and lay over B'Elanna Torres, her mouth finding the cheek and kissed it gently to the point the bite came as a shock, but B'Elanna's only reaction was to arch the rest of her body into Seven.</P>
<P>As B'Elanna had done for her she lapped wound clean and seemed to be marvelling at the taste as she lay down and rested her head to her mates shoulder. B'Elanna then sat up and urged Seven up with her. The two women simply stared at each other, B'Elanna's wide smile being answered with a shy one of Seven's. B'Elanna reached out and put her hand behind Seven's head and pulled her into a kiss, one that was deep and passionate, but also soothing, a testament to their passion instead of a continuation of it. Torres then looked deeply into the soft, trusting eyes of Seven of Nine. "There is more. if you want it." Torres felt her human side reassert itself as an wash of insecurity, but her klingon side had hold and forced it down. "The Oath." The momentary confusion left Seven's eyes as they softened and she nodded</P>
