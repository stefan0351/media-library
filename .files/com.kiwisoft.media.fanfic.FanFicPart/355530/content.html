<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 16 -->

<p><b>2004 - Fall</b></p>

<p>Katie looked down at her nails, her features contorting
into a frown as she picked at the nail of her index finger with her thumb. She'd
gotten all of the paint out from underneath them hours ago, before she'd gone out,
but she'd gotten so used to being covered in paint, paint chips, paint fumes and
other paint accessories, that she sometimes felt phantom symptoms. For the past six months
that was all she'd been doing, painting in Italy covered in sweat under large ceiling
fans, painting in Scotland covered in rags with open windows, painting, painting, and
painting. But for what? That was the question she didn't have an answer to any more.
Before, when she painted it was like a calm came over her heart and everything made sense,
it was like diving into a cool pond on a hot summer's day. It was cathartic and
freeing and she loved every minute of it. That's why she did it, because she loved it
because it was a beautiful part of her. But it was different now, the art still flowed
into her, but it was desperate and volatile and harsh. It ripped through her, violently
purging her emotions onto the canvas in relentless waves. It was exhausting, and painful,
and left her with a terrible feeling of emptiness when it was done. And every time she
started a new work, she talked to herself until she was convinced that the next one would
be different, that this one would make it better, and the world would be full of light
again, but she had finished so many 'next ones' that she had lost count. And
nothing had gotten better, nothing had changed, her soul was still a void.</p>

<p>Katie felt a hand land on her shoulder drawing her out of
her musing. Turning her head to the side she found a smiling face looking over at her. The
woman was tall and bronzed with shoulder length, wavy brown hair, stunning by
anyone's standards, gorgeous my most peoples. Gema. Katie dropped her hand back down
to her side and plastered a smile across her face.</p>

<p>"What were you looking at? Gema asked curiously,
wondering what could possibly have captured the other woman's attention. The
intensity of Katie's look had surprised her when she'd emerged from the
washroom, the seriousness of it not matching with what she had seen of the other woman
before.</p>

<p>"Hands," Katie responded dismissively.
"Let's see if we can't find a more productive use for them," she
continued wiggling her eyebrows suggestively before turning a speculative eye on the woman
beside her.</p>

<p>"Works for me," Gema replied reaching down and
grasping Katie's hand, allowing the dirty blonde to begin to lead her down the
hallway, though her motions were interrupted when they heard the front door of the
apartment open.</p>

<p>"A letter came for you," Julia called out her
eyes drifting over to the two women and immediately knowing what was going on.
"It's from Jessie," she added in what she hoped was a blasé tone to the
woman holding Katie's hand, but a pointed one to Katie.</p>

<p>Katie looked over at Julia for a moment, then over to the
counter where she could see a letter, then over a Gema. Jessie a name that become
synonymous in her mind with both heaven and hell. "I'll just be a second,"
she said to the beautiful brunette and then she slowly crossed the room, sharing a look
with Julia before picking up the letter.</p>

<p>Katie closed her eyes momentarily as she finished reading
the letter, and then with a shaking hand carefully put it back into the envelope. She had
talked to Jessie since that day she had called to inform her girlfriend of her trip, but
they hadn't talked much. At first they'd called, because they hadn't
remembered how not to have the other in their life, because they hadn't wanted to
learn again, but they'd soon stopped. Things had changed, they weren't really
seeing each other anymore, and every time that they spoke, and their voices were distant
out of the fear of getting hurt it was like losing each other over again. The thinly
veiled hurt, and anger and fear creating a palpable wedge between them. So, for months
Katie hadn't heard anything from Jessie, no letters, or emails, or phone calls.
Nothing, and then this letter, this letter where Jessie said that she missed her, and that
maybe not talking to each other wasn't the best thing to do. This letter where she
said that she knows things have been weird between them, but that they could work on that,
on everything. This letter where she said that she's not even sure why she's
writing, or what she's feeling, or what they could even do, but that she wants to try
because being away from Katie is harder than she thought it would be, and she had been
expecting something on the harsher side of devastating.</p>

<p>Placing the letter down on the counter once more, Katie
took a deep, shuddering breath, the confusion she had been feeling as she read the letter
having quickly turned into anger. She'd had her heart torn out and stomped on for the
past six months. She'd been totally consumed and tortured, haunted during her waking
and sleeping hours by memories of Jessie, and thoughts of them possibly getting back
together. And, now that she had finally started to pull her shit together, had finally
decided to stop living in the past, or some fantasy world in her head, and at least
attempt to move on, Jessie had to write that letter. But Katie wasn't biting this
time, she couldn't afford to, because she knew that if she accepted, three months
later, when they hadn't seen each other for a while and Jessie started to find it
hard again, she'd break up with her again and she'd end up right where she had
been at the beginning of summer. They'd gone through this at varying degrees for two
years, since the day she'd left Jessie's fear and anxiety and the inevitable
result of it had been looming over their heads, and she couldn't do it anymore. She
was tired of her life being a blur, of having memories of times that should have been
amazing covered in dark clouds. She was starting to get some sensation back and meant to
hold on to it. No, she wasn't going to let Jessie plunder her heart again; she was
through, no more yoyo. This pretty jellyfish had found its spine.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Katie said to Julia absently turning
back around, composed once more.</p>

<p>"No problem," Julia responded watching Katie push
off the counter and walk back over to the woman she had left moments ago. So that was it
then, the fall of Camelot.</p>

<p>"Feel like finishing the tour?" Katie said as she
approached Gema, her lips curving up mischievously.</p>
