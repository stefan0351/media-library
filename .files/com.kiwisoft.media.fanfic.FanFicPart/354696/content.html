<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>"Why don't you just sit in her lap! I mean she's your
girlfriend any way, and it would give me so much more room." Willow
didn't quite glare at Anya, but she did glare at Xander who was
grinning at the three girls from his position in the front passenger's
seat of Giles convertible. Tara looked over at Willow. "W...well. I sup...
suppose it would be ok." Willow smiled at Tara, but before she could
answer Anya spoke up again. "That's it! Stop this car!" Giles didn't
even bother speaking as he eased the car over to the shoulder of the
road. As soon as it came to a complete stop she almost leapt from her
seat and stormed over to the front passenger side door. Yanking it
open she glared at her boyfriend. "Get out!" He looked up at her."
What?" She put her hands on her hips. "You heard me, get out. You
stole that shot gunning seat before the rest of us had a chance, and
now I am taking it back." </p>

<p>He seemed ready to speak, but her glare kept him silent as he
slunk to the back of the car. She had a smug little smile on her face
as she slid in beside Giles and put on her seat belt. "That's much
better." While that was happening Xander was attempting to get
comfortable in the back seat. As the jostling continued Tara looked
over at Willow. "You still could." Willow looked confused. "Could
what?" "Sit in my l...l...lap." Willow was smiling until she saw Xander
was as well and settled for giving the young man a shove. Giles sighed
as he pulled the car back onto the road. "Now settle down back there!"
Xander, Willow and even Tara suddenly grinned at him, Xander being the
first to speak. "Or what? You'll turn this car around?" The teasing
continued in a similar vein as they continued down the road to Los
Angeles. </p>

<p>Now ahead of them, Buffy had turned in her seat to see why
Giles car had stopped. "You think something's wrong?" Faith smiled and
shook her head. "Nah, look Anya is just yelling at Xander, business as
usual. We have more important things to worry about." As she finished
her sentence she leaned forward from the back seat to the front, and
the radio while Spike slapped her hands away. "My car, my radio."
Faith sat back in a sulk. "Can't we listen to something that's not
older then I am?" When Buffy turned back around from Spike saw the
concerned look in her eyes. "Don't worry slayer. They have the
address. Xander's just going to get pussy whipped a bit and then
they'll be right behind us." Faith arched her brow. "Oh, and you are
one to talk about being whipped?" Spike scowled into the rearview
mirror he was using to keep an eye on his passengers more then the
road. </p>

<p>Faith smirked back into the mirror. "Dru just has to do that
loony sing song voice and you'll be all over her." Spike grinned at
the dark haired slayer. "Don't be so shocked. I'd bet shed make you
melt with her baby doll voice too... that is if you didn't already have
your own baby doll." His words were said as Buffy turned around again
from looking out the back window. "Yeah, whatever girlfriend." He
jerked his head. "What?" She smirked at him. "Come on now Spike. You
and Faith hanging out, talking about stuff, you're her Willow." The
bleached blond was confused at that until Buffy grinned at him. "It's
a good thing... if you like being a girl's best girlfriend." Faith
rolled her eyes at her own girlfriend. "Take out the girl part and you
got it." Spike smiled at that and squared his shoulders. "Why thank
you Ducks." Faith smiled and nodded at him.</p>

<p>Buffy decided to continue. "Yeah, who would have thought a
vampire could become best friends with a vampire slayer?" Spike
smirked at her. "Probably the ones who thought a slayer would shag a
vampire." Buffy frowned at him as he continued. "Still, it's not like
I bother with most of that crap. I mean I wasted the annoying one, I
stopped the mouth of Hell from being opened... when I became a vampire I
got rid of rules. I didn't just trade one set for another." Buffy
arched her brows at him. "So you'll do whatever you damn well please
and to Hell with the consequences?" Spike smiled rather evilly. "Now
you're getting it pet." "I'm not your pet, but I do have a better
understanding of why you and Faith get along." As she spoke Spike got
out a cigarette and lit up as he replied. "And why is that?" She
smirked at him. "Because she's is a good girl with a bad side, and you
are a bad boy with a good side." </p>

<p>Spike blew out a puff of smoke. "That's a horrible thing to
say about a guy!" Faith seemed to be looking at the vampire closely.
"No Spike, she right, and that's your strength." He looked intrigued.
"How so?" "You feel, and I mean more then hate, rage, or lust like
most vamps. You feel things like love, tenderness. Things like that
are normally thought to be part of a soul, but somehow your demon
remembered them." Spike exhaled again, but this time he drew it out.
"Can't argue that." The car seemed to lapse into silence with Spike
watching the road, and Buffy resting her head to Faith's shoulder, and
Faith resting her cheek against the top of Buffy's head. It stayed
that way until they entered the Los Angeles City limits.</p>

<p>Most of the Scoobies were staring slack-jawed in the lobby of
the new offices of Angel Investigations, but Xander was already
talking as he walked up to Wesley. "I say Boy! Carry my bags up to my
room and there will be a nice tip in it for you." That seemed to break
the silence that had fallen over the Scoobies as Wesley replied. "I'll
give you the tip Xander. Carry your own bags." His fellow rogue
watcher stepped forward and in front of Xander. "He does make a good
point though. Perhaps we should settle into our rooms and then meet in
some central area to make plans?" Wesley nodded and turned to get
keys. As Angel exited his office Spike spoke far louder then was
necessary. "Nice place Angel, it suits you, big and useless." An elbow
powered by the slayer strength of Buffy Summers cut off anything else
William the Bloody would have said and turned it into a muffled grunt
of pain.</p>

<p>While everyone stepped forward to get keys Gunn stepped near
Faith and the dark haired slayer gave her partner a nod. While Buffy
went to get there key Gunn started speaking. "So you two getting the
honeymoon suite?" Faith smirked at that and arched a brow. "Probably,
any problem with that?" Gunn grinned. "Nah, I think it's a beautiful
thing." Faith laughed out loud. "We get that a lot, but I have a
feeling that you're not here to talk to me about my girlfriend... of
course I could be wrong." Gunn shook his head. "Nah, it's this Spike
guy. When Angel talks about him he is a bad ass or a pain in the ass.
I mean I'm already working with one vampire, but at least Angel has
that whole curse deal. What's keeping blondie in line?" "You mean
besides regular beatings from me and Buffy?" Faith took a considering
breath before she continued.</p>

<p>"There is a microchip imbedded in his brain that keeps him
from being able to hurt any human being." Gunn was shocked at that.
"For real? Why aren't there more vamps like that running around?"
Faith shook her head. "It was this big top secret government project,
and the whole point of the chip was keeping the vamps from attacking
them. The fact it keeps him from his typical maiming and killing ways
is just a bonus." "So what, Uncle Sam was recruiting bloodsuckers?"
Faith nodded. "Them and any other demon they could get their hands on.
They had this big idea that they could control the demons, but demons
got out, place got trashed, and now Spike's chip is just a relic of
our tax dollars at work." The conversation broke up as everyone
started picking up their bags and heading towards their rooms. As
Buffy and Faith climbed the stairs the petite blonde smiled at her
partner. "Make a new friend?" Faith grinned back at her. </p>

<p>When they had gotten to the room Faith chuckled and looked at
a blushing Buffy. "It was Cordelia's idea." Faith looked around the
honeymoon suite and laughed more openly. "I'll have to thank her."
Faith's voice then started to deepen. "Of course this IS our first
night in the honeymoon suite." Buffy's smile grew playful as Faith
stepped away from where they had set their luggage and advanced on
Buffy. The smaller slayer was backing away, but smiling all the while.
The two slayers stood eyeing each other, Faith seeming to look for an
opening to grab Buffy and Buffy looking for an opening to get away.
"Come on B, you going to let a honeymoon suite go to waste?" Buffy put
on a fake pout. "You didn't even carry me across the threshold." Faith
smirked. "Let's fix that." With those words she lunged and got her
hands on Buffy's hips. With no seeming effort she lifted her straight
up and held her. From that position Buffy wrapped her legs around
Faith, at first they were under Faith's arms, but she slid down the
dark slayers body until they caught at Faith's hips.</p>

<p>There she tightened her legs hold and leaned into press her
lips to Faith's. Buffy's arms wrapped around Faiths head to cradle it
while her fingers played with the wild curls of soft brown hair
flowing from Faith's head. Faith's arms wrapped around Buffy's waist
while her hands slid to support the smaller slayer's shapely behind.
They barely broke for air as their kisses continued, tongues meeting
in yet another passionate form of contest between the pair. A contest
that neither could gain an advantage in, it could have went far longer
if their slayer senses had not indicated the presence of a vampire.
Faith still held Buffy aloft as they broke the kiss and turned to look
at Spike. He looked back blankly and continued to do so as Buffy and
Faith let go of each other and Buffy slipped to stand on the ground
again. They continued to stare at him for a long beat until he seemed
to shake himself. "Sorry to interrupt but they're planning the big
powwow in the lobby."</p>

<p>The two girls nodded and sighed as they walked out past a
smirking Spike. Buffy walked ahead of them as Faith dropped back to
walk next to Spike. "Enjoy the show?" His grin grew. "How could I not?
Even with out the shapely bodies you two still have enough chemistry
between you to burn up any vamp." Faith nodded. "Yeah, it's suprising
it took as long as it did for me and B to hook up." Spike shook his
head. "You two didn't just "hook up" she hasn't had that look since
Angel, but it's missing that doomed expression." Faith made a sound
that seemed to both laugh and scoff. "That's probably why we didn't
fall in love before. I was so fucked up I would have hurt her more
then Angelus." Spike shrugged. "Big deal. The little thing obviously
adores you as much as you do her, and that's that." "Better not let
her hear you calling her the little thing, but yeah. I guess you're
right." </p>

<p>While they shared a smile his was larger. "I usually am."
"This coming from the guy that turned Harmony?" His expression quickly
soured. "I said usually." Faith laughed at him as they entered the
lobby. Cordelia looked up at the pair as they walked up to the main
seating area. "I'm glad you're happy." Faith slid in to share a larger
padded chair with Buffy. "Why, what's up?" Cordelia blew her bangs out
of her face. "It's a matter of what's down, but I'll let Xander
explain since it's his dumb idea." Alexander Harris frowned at his
ex-girlfriend as he started to explain. "Well we were going over
Wolfram and Heart security, and practices." When Faith seemed confused
he explained. "Practices is like their hours, if they get a lot of
deliveries and stuff like that." Faith nodded. "So security is tight?"
All of Angel Investigations nodded as Angel spoke. "That, and they are
geared to deal with the supernatural. So they have things like vampire
detectors." </p>

<p>Xander nodded. "So what we are doing is trying to find holes
in the system." Cordelia then piped in. "Actually we're making them.
Go ahead! Tell them!" Xander didn't seem phased and actually seemed
exasperated by the former cheerleader. "They are going to have every
point of access guarded so we are going to make one, and since we are
talking about subterranean chambers there's going to be some digging."
Anya was smiling proudly. "With all of Xander's construction work and
living underground he is perfectly suited for the job." He smiled as
his face got red from his girlfriend's praise. While Faith was
grinning along with most of the group she poised a question. "So?
Wouldn't they detect that too?" Angel was the one to answer. "Not in
LA." Buffy was snuggled so close that when she spoke Faith actually
felt it where her chest was against Buffy's back. "Of course." Faith
arched her neck around Buffy. "Well you ARE the brains, care to
explain to the looks?" Buffy scrunched up her face as she smiled. "LA
geology is kind of like Jell-O with all the quakes and stuff. So it
would be a waste of time and money for them."</p>

<p>Xander nodded again. "So except for some thick walls there's
not much they could do, and we've got the gal pals and the father and
son team to take care of that." Buffy, Faith, Angel, and Spike all
frowned at him as Willow spoke. "But that still leaves the cameras and
stuff. I have been trying to hack their system, but the stuff
connected to the net is no good." Buffy considered that. "So all the
important stuff is all inside." Willow nodded, and as she did Tara's
discomfort seemed to visibly increase. Silently she laid her hand on
Tara's leg and rubbed just above the knee. When Tara looked up she saw
Willow smiling at her and she relaxed, but the concern on her face
never faded. While all this was happening Gunn seemed rather stilled,
he was looking at Willow and Tara, then he looked at Buffy and Faith.
Faith winked at him. "Something in the water." He then looked at
Cordelia and she squealed. "Noooooo!" At which he simply shrugged. </p>

<p>Angel shook his head. "Ok, Willow needs to get into Wolfram
and Heart. Now they are going to know my face and the rest of Angel
Investigations." Faith suddenly looked downcast. "They'll know me
too." She then found her hands being taken by Buffy, and held by Buffy
in front of her in her lap. "They'd know both of us. We ARE the
slayers after all." Faith just nodded. Spike then grinned. "We'll
they'd be hard pressed NOT to know me. You have to figure that applies
to the world's luckiest Watcher as well." Giles straightened his
glasses at that. "I beg your pardon?" Spike smirked. "Oh come on. I
can just imagine what it would be like to watch Faith and Buffy... in
fact I think I will." Spike then closed his eyes and got a wicked grin
on his face.</p>
