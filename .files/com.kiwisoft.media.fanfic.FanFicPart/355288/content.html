<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - You Are The Weakest Link-Good Bye -->

<p>"Why'd she do it, Jane?" Brooke asked mournfully as she leaned her head
against Jane's shoulder as they sat on Sam's bed a few nights later. Things were
indeed calmer in the Palace without Sam around, Mike was acting more like
himself, but Brooke wasn't and Jane was becoming worried. But Mike didn't seem
to notice. True to her word, Jane was keeping a very close eye on her daughter's
true love. She held the distraught girl closer and tried to put words to Sam's
reasoning, reasoning even she didn't fully understand. </p>
<p>"She wanted to spare you, Brooke. She hates seeing you in pain," Jane began.
Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"But being away from her causes me pain, doesn't she see that? God, I feel
like I'm dying," she bewailed as fresh tears began to flow. Brooke thought after
this long she'd be out of tears but they never seemed to stop. Jane sighed and
silently cursed her daughter's decision to leave. </p>
<p>"She was doing what she thought was the right thing. Whether we agree or not
isn't the point, her heart was in the right place. I know it's hard to
understand, Hell, I'm her mother and I don't understand how her mind works but
it was tearing her apart to watch what this was doing to you and Mike. You know
Sam, if there something she could do to stop it, she'd do it and to Hell with
personal cost." </p>
<p>"But it's not fair! Why can't I have both? Why can't Dad just accept things
as they are and move on?" Brooke demanded angrily. </p>
<p>"Because you're his little girl, Brooke. It's very difficult to be faced with
something like this," Jane explained patiently. </p>
<p>"But you've worked through it, haven't you? Sam and me, I mean? You don't
think any less of us now, do you?" Brooke asked fearfully. Jane smiled gently
and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not at all. But I have a few advantages Mike doesn't. First off, I'm a
woman, we tend to look at things differently anyway. Somehow, you've managed to
offend his manhood, although I have no idea how. Secondly, I saw what was going
on between you two so I had an idea even if I did try to ignore it at first.
Sure, I was a little disturbed, but once I got past the glaringly obvious, I saw
the genuine, deep love between the two of you. Mike hasn't been able to see that
because he's unwilling to see that." </p>
<p>"Why? I don't see what Sam and I have as wrong. I just don't. How can love be
wrong?" </p>
<p>"It's not, honey. I think Mike feels that he's failed somewhere with raising
you. He has a blonde, blue-eyed, cheerleading, homecoming queen daughter, the
perfect recipe for All-American and you turn around and tell him you're gay. And
in love with your soon-to-be-stepsister. His entire world was suddenly turned on
its axis and he didn't know how to handle it. So he reacted the only way
available to him, badly." </p>
<p>"Oh," Brooke said as Jane's words sunk in. "But that doesn't explain why he
blamed Sammy. I'm gay with or without her." Jane sighed. </p>
<p>"No, it doesn't explain it," barely restrained resentment colored her voice.
"But it was easier to blame the lesser known of the two of you than his own baby
girl." </p>
<p>"That's not fair. We're in this together," she paused and hung her head. "I
really thought he was going to hurt her," she finished softly. </p>
<p>"So did I," the image of Mike raising his hand to strike Sam still vividly
fresh in Jane's mind. Normally Jane knew such behavior was beyond Mike, he would
never harm her, Sam, Brooke, or Mac. But the news of Brooke's and Sam's
relationship just pushed him to a place beyond his control. That and the fact
that he had stopped short of actually hitting her were the only reasons Jane
hadn't left him on the spot. There was no way in Hell she'd stay with an abusive
man, not for herself, Sam, Mac or Brooke. </p>
<p>But Mike wasn't by nature abusive. Everyone has a breaking point and they'd
simply hit his like a watermelon hitting a brick wall at 200mph. Jane had been
expecting a bad reaction, she just hadn't been expecting one THAT bad. Mike was
a mild-mannered, go-with-the-flow kind of guy, it was one of the things that had
attracted Jane to him in the first place. And yet here he was doing his best
right wing, Christian coalitian, homophobic, not-in-my-family imitation and he
was pretty damn convincing. And it baffled Jane how he could have reacted so
badly. </p>
<p>He had turned on Sam like a pitbull on a ketcup covered cat and it had scared
her. In Mike's eyes, the whole situation was some sort of plot on Sam's part to
tear the family apart. That somehow, Sam had twisted Brooke's sweet sisterly
affections into something perverted and was just using the girl to justify her
own sick cause. But Jane knew differently. If only Mike would listen to reason.
</p>
<p>"I've never seen my Dad act that way, Mom," Brooke sighed as she wrapped
Sam's blanket around herself tighter, drinking in the smell of Sam. Jane shook
her head. </p>
<p>"That was an extreme, Brooke. We all know he never would have hurt her." </p>
<p>"I know, it doesn't make it any less scary, though," Brooke pointed out. Jane
shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, it doesn't," she agreed. "Are you coming down to dinner?" Brooke
shrugged. </p>
<p>"No, not hungry." Jane gave her a disapproving look. </p>
<p>"Brooke, you have to eat," she started. Brooke huffed angrily at her. </p>
<p>"I am, don't start that with me. I just don't want to eat with HIM, all
right? Everytime I try to talk to him he acts like nothing's wrong and Sam never
existed. He's not meeting me halfway, here Jane and I can't be expected to do
all the work. I'm trying but he has to try too." </p>
<p>"All right, calm down. I'll try to talk to him tonight, see if I can get
through to him myself. In the meantime, grab a snack, please. Sam asked me to
keep an eye on you so I am. Plus I care about you as well. Don't do this,
Brooke, it won't help." Brooke glared at her and pulled away. </p>
<p>"Whatever, enjoy dinner," she snapped as she crawled down into Sam's bed.
Jane sighed and left the room. </p>

<p>Two weeks later, Jane couldn't stand it anymore and picked up the phone.
Enough was enough. It was picked up on the third ring. </p>
<p>"Brahm residence, Sam speaking, whatcha want? Because we ain't buying," Sam
answered in typical Sam fashion. </p>
<p>"Sam, it's Mom," Jane said hastily into the phone. </p>
<p>"What's wrong, Mom?" Sam asked, instantly picking up on the bad vibes coming
through her mother's voice. "What's wrong with Brooke?" </p>
<p>"She's at it again, Sam. You need to come home before she's too far gone this
time." </p>
