<P>a/n: well I had this new idea for a new story cause I don't know what I want to do with my other ones…even after I changed it…I'm braindead with that story, and have wanted to do a new story sooo I came up with this idea while I was bored and waiting on my friend today. Haha. Well tell me how you like it and if you've got any ideas for my other story you should let me know….</P><P>(I'll try to update this as much as possible, I get busy during the school year that is rapidly creeping upon me…and my other story if any ideas come around)</P><P>Summary: There is no Hannah Montana, and Miley is not famous. They are in Tennessee. Lilly goes on vacation there. Buuut, what happens when they meet? LILEY, for sure.</P><P>- May switch from Miley to Lilly's POV, I haven't decided that yet….</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own Miley Cyrus, or any of her friends, or Disney channel's Hannah Montana, or any of the songs that are included in this fanfic. :(</P><P>Rating: T - I'll try to keep my cursing to a minimum, and sexualness won't be occurring very in detail. I'm no good at writing raunchy things. Sorry kids, or not so kids, look elsewhere for worded porno. :/ (you should still give it a go though, I try to write alright and won't waste my time if I think it's bad…)</P><P>Title: Sometimes I Wish I Could Be Famous…</P><P>Chapter One; THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS</P><P>As I was roaming the hills of Tennessee pondering why my mother chose this state of states to go to for a vacation, the reason beyond my grasp, I happened upon a curious sight. There was a girl on top of a hill…the top of the hill that I was now slowly wandering up; she looked like she was rocking an air guitar, but I couldn't tell because her back was to me, and I heard words drifting my way, but I still wasn't close enough to hear what they were. 'Maybe I should turn around…she could be crazy or something…' I thought to myself, but then I heard a sentence of what she was saying, or actually she was singing, it sounded like, "You get the best of both worlds, Chillin' out take it slow, then you rock out the show…" 'What is she singing about?...and more importantly to who…?' I kept slowly inching towards this strange brown headed girl who was singing atop a hill in the middle of nowhere. I got to the point where I could just barely see over the hill, and see who she was singing to…a group of cows. She finished her song about having the "best of both worlds" and said, "Thank you Los Angeles! You guys are great, I'll see y'all next time!" and then in return a cow moo-ed, "I know Alfred, you're my biggest fan. Thank you for all the support." She walked up to him and gave him a pat on the head…finally turning and seeing me staring at her with my mouth wide open. "See something interestin'?" She asked.</P><P>"Uh," I chuckled nervously, she was actually…not crazy…looking. She was gorgeous, and man I hope she wasn't crazy, cause then I think I'd have a crush on a crazy girl. "Y-yeah, great cows."</P><P>She smirked, "I know, they're sweethearts for the most part…except Sally, she's a jerk you might want to watch out for her." She pointed over at a cow that had a huge set of horns on her head.</P><P>I just stared at her.</P><P>"Sorry you caught me singing like that, I only do it for the cows."</P><P>"No, no. It was nice…what song were you singing?" I asked, truthfully curious.</P><P>"The Besta Both Worlds." She had an accent, and when she wasn't singing it was more prominent. "I wrote it…I write most of the songs I sing."</P><P>"Oh, that's cool." I tilted my head to the side, not understanding the best of "both" worlds part still.</P><P>She laughed at the confused look on my face, "It's just like…me pretending I'm famous but I'm still a normal girl at the same time. It's just a dream I have...or had, I use to beg my daddy to let me be a singer when I grew up, now it's just more of a hobby."</P><P>I smiled slightly, "Ohh, well you do have a good voice."</P><P>"Thanks, that's sweet of you."</P><P>I tried not to smile any bigger than I already was as I thought, 'She thinks I'm sweet!'</P><P>"Well," she walked around a tree and came out on the other side of it pulling a grayish looking horse behind her. "Where yah headed to? Not much else out on the hills besides me and our cattle. How'd you get out here anyways? The bed and breakfast, where I assume you're staying, is like two miles away…and it's a hard walk. Just a bunch of hills, and some more hills...maybe a crick if you went past the big windmill." She grinned as she jumped up on to the horse, "Sorry I talk a lot…but you don't say much do yah?"</P><P>I shook my head, "Not really. But yeah, I'm over at the bed and breakfast with my mom…you know the place?"</P><P>"My mamma runs it, and I usually run the horse barn where you can ride horses if you want. But my brother Jackson is out there today…he's a dummy though so you should ignore him. Unless you like goofy stinky boys." She looked skeptically at me.</P><P>"I don't care for them in particular, no." I shielded the setting suns glare from my eyes.</P><P>"You need a ride back to the bed and breakfast?" She gestured to the empty area in front of the saddle. "Come on, I'll pull yah up if you jump." She held her hand out for me to grab. "It's getting dark, I don't want you walkin' alone."</P><P>I grinned at her accent, it was adorable, "Alright, thanks." I mumbled sheepishly as I grabbed her hand and she helped me on to the saddle in front of her.</P><P>"This is Bluejeans, he's a sweetheart…But I'm afraid I never got you name…" she trailed off waiting for me to fill her in.</P><P>"Oh uh, I'm Lilly."</P><P>"Miley Stewart, nice ta meet you Lilly." She awkwardly shook my hand from where she was sitting behind me. Clicking her tongue at Bluejeans the horse, "C'mon le's go Blue."</P><P>I tried not to feel giddy about the feeling of this wondrous girl sitting behind me. Maybe Tennessee wouldn't be too bad now...</P>
