<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Telling The Other Mother -->

<p>Dinner was a strained and awkward affair between Brooke and
her mother. Actually, Brooke spent more time chasing a piece of lettuce around
her plate than actually eating but that was beside the point. Kelly kept going
on about the gallery and how Brooke had to visit and how great San Francisco was
until Brooke began to entertain fantasties of stabbing her mother with her fork. </p>
<p>(Now I KNOW I spend too much time with Sam) she giggled. </p>
<p>"And has Sam ever been checked for rabies?" her mother's
question dragged Brooke from her fantasyland. </p>
<p>"Huh?" </p>
<p>"I mean, she was just way out of line speaking to me like
that. Where does she get off taking back to me like that?" Kelly questioned.
Brooke smiled at the memory of Sam walking up one side and down the other of her
mother. It had been an entertaining show. </p>
<p>"She cares for me, Mom and you said some pretty insensitive
things," Brooke informed her mother. Kelly sputtered at her for a minute.
</p>
<p>"Excuse me? But you have gotten a little horsey since I last
saw you," Brooke felt a physical need to vomit but squelched it. She knew
intellectually that she was not `horsey' or `fat' or `bloated' or a `has-been'
but emotionally her mother was beating her with a large stick and it hurt.
Brooke was suddenly reminded why she liked Jane so much. And she really wished
Sam were with her for comfort. </p>
<p>"I am not horsey," Brooke said quietly. "I'm healthy." Kelly
laughed. </p>
<p>"Keep telling yourself that, or keep believing Sam when she
tells you that but no man is going to want you looking like you do right now."
Taking a page from Sam's book, Brooke converted her hurt into anger as her only
defense. </p>
<p>"OK, Mom, that's enough," she snapped. "First off, back off.
I'm not fat, I'm happy. You can't just waltz into my life whenever you please,
pass judgement and then leave. It's not right and I won't let you. If you really
cared about what was good and right for me you never would have left in the
first place." </p>
<p>"Second, I couldn't give a rat's ass what some stupid guy
thought about how I look. If you can't accept me as I am then I don't want you.
Besides, I have someone in my life who loves me wholely, completely and without
reservation no matter what I look like. They've said as much. Love is blind,
Mom, not based on what size you wear or how much you weigh." </p>
<p>"You have someone in your life, Brooke? That's fabulous. Who
is he? Is he cute? Is he rich?" Brooke sighed and rubbed her eyes. She felt a
migraine coming on. </p>
<p>"Mom, you might want to order another drink for what I'm about
to tell you," she warned. Kelly frowned. </p>
<p>"Why Brooke? Is he a poor ugly boy?" Brooke sighed again and
rested her head in her hand for a second. She then looked back at her mother. </p>
<p>"OK, I warned you," she said simply. "Simply put, Mom, he is a
she." All the color drained from Kelly's face. </p>
<p>"Excuse me?" she asked in a low voice. Brooke felt a chill
wash over her and knew this wasn't going to be pretty. Again she wished Sam were
with her. </p>
<p>"Mom, I'm gay," she explained slowly. The paleness of her
mother's face was replaced with a red tint that was alarming to Brooke. (Oh,
that's not good) </p>
<p>"You're gay?" Kelly repeated. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes," she said confidently. Kelly blinked at her for a few
minutes. </p>
<p>"And who is this person who loves you `wholely, completely and
without reservation no matter what you look like'?" she asked sarcastically.
Brooke winced and braced herself for what was sure to be a messy fallout.
</p>
<p>"Sam," she told her mother with conviction. Kelly's face
shifted from red to purple. It was an odd parody of Mike's reaction. </p>
<p>"What? SAM?" It amazed Brooke sometimes how such a small
word,three little letters could wind people up so much. "You have got to be
kidding me! That piece of trash?" Now Brooke was getting angry again.
</p>
<p>"She is not trash, she's the most loving and generous person I
know and I love her with all my heart. But you know nothing about true love, do
you?" </p>
<p>"Brooke, you're not gay. No daughter of mine could possibly be
gay. It's just a phase, an experimentation. All teens go through this sort of
thing." Brooke rolled her eyes heavenward and groaned as she buried her face in
her hands. </p>
<p>"Oh, here we go," she muttered. </p>
<p>"Brooke, I live in San Francisco, I see gay people all the
time and you don't fit the mold," Kelly continued apparently happy just to hear
herself talking. "You're not gay, sweetie. You're too good looking." Brooke
groaned again. </p>
<p>"Have you seen Melissa Etheridge's present girlfriend? Tammy,
I think her name is," she asked no one in particular. Kelly ignored her and kept
talking. </p>
<p>"Besides, I know for a fact your father would never stand for
it. He'd probably try to kill Sam." Brooke winced. </p>
<p>"Been there, done that," she sighed. "Not a happy memory." </p>
<p>"So you aren't gay," Kelly concluded. Brooke looked at her
mother. </p>
<p>"Do you feel better now?" she asked sarcastically. </p>
<p>"What do you mean, honey?" Kelly asked confused. </p>
<p>"Now that you've had your rant, do you feel better? I mean, it
doesn't change anything, I'm still gay and in love with Sam." Kelly rolled her
eyes. </p>
<p>"How could you possibly love HER?" Brooke slammed her hands
down on the table. </p>
<p>"I do! Live with it!" Brooke yelled as she stood up.
</p>
<p>"You are NOT gay," Kelly challenged again. Brooke took a deep
breath, stood on her chair and yelled for everyone's attention in the
restaurant. Her father was probably going to kill her for this stunt but her
mother had pushed her too far. </p>
<p>"Attention everybody! Yeah, hi, sorry to interrupt your dinner
but I have a little announcement to make," she started. Everyone was staring at
her. </p>
<p>"Brooke, get down from there," Kelly ordered. Brooke grinned
wickedly. </p>
<p>"I just wanted everyone to know that I, Brooke McQueen,
daughter of Kelly McQueen Foster here," she pointed at her mother who sunk down
in her seat. "Am GAY! Yes, that's right, gay! Homosexual, fruity, lesbian,
queer, a dyke. And I am deeply in love with my stepsister Samantha McPherson who
loves me back! You can now return to your dinners." She hopped down off her
chair and was surprised when most of the patrons applauded her. She bowed and
headed towards the door stopping first at her mortified mother's side.
</p>
<p>"Believe me now?" she asked before leaving. </p>

<p>Sam was curled in a ball on her bed laughing hysterically and
trying frantically to stop to no avail. The picture Brooke had just painted for
her was just too priceless. She held on to her sides and kept laughing, tears
running down her cheeks as Brooke sat nearby patiently waiting for her to regain
her composure. Sam was almost to the point of making herself sick she was
laughing so hard. </p>
<p>"So you?you `outed' yourself," she started when she calmed
down some. "And me," she added, "in the middle of one of the ritziest
restaurants in L.A. just to shut your mother up?" Brooke nodded with a sheepish
grin and Sam started laughing again until the hiccups started. </p>
<p>"I wish I could (hic) have seen it!" Sam roared with laughter.
Brooke joined her on the bed and pulled her into her embrace. </p>
<p>"You should have seen her face, Sammy," Brooke laughed at the
memory of the mortified/pissed look on Kelly's face. Sam hiccuped. </p>
<p>"I wish I had," she agreed. She played with Brooke's hair for
a few minutes while they both calmed down from what really wasn't a funny
situation. "Are you OK, Princess?" Sam asked seriously. Brooke sighed.
</p>
<p>"Why couldn't she have been more like Jane? You know, cool
about it?" Brooke wondered outloud. Sam hugged her tighter. </p>
<p>"Then my mom wouldn't be so cool," Sam said cheekily. Brooke
smiled at her. "She'll get over it, Brooke, or she won't. Either way, she's
never been that big a part of your life. I know her opinion means a lot, I don't
understand why, but I know it does. Just know that I'm here for you and that I
love you." </p>
<p>"I know Sammy, thank you," Brooke whispered as she kissed Sam.
A knock at the door interrupted them. Sam turned her head. </p>
<p>"Who's there?" she called as Brooke kissed her way down her
neck. </p>
<p>"Mike. Can I talk to you two?" Brooke growled into Sam's neck
and Sam let out a sigh that bordered on a laugh. She got up and let Mike in. </p>
<p>"Hey Mike, what's up?" Sam asked nonchalantly as Brooke made
no attempt to get off the bed. Mike sat down in a chair nearby as Sam sat back
on the bed and Brooke wrapped her arms around her. </p>
<p>"Brooke, your mother just called," he started. </p>
<p>"Uh-oh," Sam mumbled. </p>
<p>"Kelly," Brooke said suddenly. Both Mike and Sam looked at her
confused. </p>
<p>"What honey? Mike asked. </p>
<p>"Kelly. She may have given birth to me but my Mom is Jane.
She's the one who loves and takes care of me despite the things I do. That's a
mom. It's not a matter of blood, it's a matter of love. Please, call my
birthmother Kelly when refering to her from now on," Brooke explained. Mike and
Sam both smiled. </p>
<p>"Mom will love to hear that," Sam said giving Brooke a
squeeze. </p>
<p>"Yes, Brooke, she will," Mike agreed. "OK, Kelly just called,
absolutely livid about a scene you apparently caused." </p>
<p>"Dad, I can explain?" Brooke started. Mike held up a hand to
stop her. </p>
<p>"Let me just see if I have this straight. You told her about
you and Sam and, knowing Kelly, she didn't take it well. How am I doing so far?"
Mike asked. </p>
<p>"Pretty good," Brooke admitted. </p>
<p>"OK, so, after that she protested you being gay and wouldn't
listen to your explaination so you got up on your chair and announced it to the
entire restaurant. Do I have that all correct?" Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Uh, yeah," she said. Mike nodded slowly. </p>
<p>"To the ENTIRE restaurant?" </p>
<p>"Uh-huh." </p>
<p>"Just checking," Mike sighed. "She is one pissed off woman.
She seems to think this is all either my fault or Sam's." Brooke eyed her
father. </p>
<p>"You're not mad?" Mike smiled. </p>
<p>"You publically humiliated your mother, sorry, Kelly, as the
only way to make her listen. I have my own issues with the two of you but that
won't change anything. So, you want to stand on a chair and announce it, it's
your life Brooke. I just wish I had a picture of Kelly's face." Brooke and Sam
started laughing. </p>
<p>"So do I, Mike," Sam agreed. </p>
<p>"What else did she say?" Brooke asked. Mike sighed.
</p>
<p>"She still doesn't want to accept that you're really gay
despite the fact that I told her you were. And she really has something against
you Sam," he said sadly. Sam shrugged. She could care less. "She still wants to
be here for your graduation but wants no more mention of your sexual
preference." </p>
<p>"Whatever," Brooke said. "I'm not going to hide it from her
either." </p>
<p>"Don't," Mike said. "Be yourselves and make her deal with it
like you did me. She either will or she can leave." </p>
<p>"Thanks Mike," Sam said genuinely happy that he seemed to be
dealing better. </p>
<p>"Yeah thanks Dad." Mike smiled at the two girls. </p>
<p>"Goodnight. See you in the morning." Mike got up and left
leaving the two girls alone in the room again. Brooke laid down on the bed
taking Sam with her. </p>
<p>"Now, where were we?" Brooke purred into Sam's ear making the
brunette shiver. </p>
