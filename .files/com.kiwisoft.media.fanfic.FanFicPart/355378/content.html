<!-- No Regrets \ Cries in the Dark -->

<p>"Mom stopped by this morning. She says that you look better," Brooke spoke
quietly to her silent companion. "It's hard for her to see you like this,
Sammy. Don't hold it against her. She's doing the best she can but, her
marriage to my Dad is kinda strained right now." Brooke sighed and ran her hand
through her hair.</p>
<p>She hated hearing her parents fight. But Jane was still angry that Mike
hadn't done more to stop Nicole from driving away that night. She needed
someone to blame for her daughter's condition and Mike was the most convenient
target. And for his part, Mike wasn't going to sit idly by and take the blame.
He fought back every time Jane verbally attacked him. Now the Palace, once
amiable as it basked in the warmth of new love, was cold and dark as the couple
fought.</p>
<p>"I don't know if they're going to be able to come through this, Sammy," she
lamented. She stroked Sam's furrowed brow.</p>
<p>"It's not your fault though, Sam. It's Nicole's," she growled the name of
her former best friend. "I swear to you that I will make her pay for this." Her
vow fell on deaf ears as Sam didn't respond. Brooke sighed again.</p>
<p>"It should be me, Sammy," she whispered. "I should be lying there hurt or
even dead. Not you. Not my sweet Sammy." Guilt washed over the blonde in
suppressive waves, choking off her air and nearly suffocating her. The pain in
her chest caused by her grief was visceral, tangible and made her sick to her
stomach. Hot tears slipped down her face, burning tracks across her cheeks and
staining Sam's bed sheets.</p>
<p>"Come back to me, Sammy...please," she begged desperately. The sound of the
door opening startled Brooke and made her jump. Dr. Stevens, Sam's main doctor,
gave Brooke a sad smile as he entered the room. He checked Sam's charts and
monitors before turning his attention to the blonde sentinel.</p>
<p>"How is she today, Brooke?" he asked. He knew that Brooke was a better
indicator of Sam's condition than any chart or monitor was. The girl seemed to
have an intuitive sixth sense about how Sam was feeling. Brooke's shoulders
slumped.</p>
<p>"Quiet, for now," she answered softly. She traced Sam's eyebrows with the
pads of her fingertips. "Something's bothering her though. She's not really
resting." Dr. Steven's nodded.</p>
<p>"We've lightened up some of her meds. She may be feeling more pain and
becoming somewhat more aware of her surroundings," he explained. Brooke's eyes
lit up somewhat.</p>
<p>"Are you going to bring her around soon?" she asked hopefully. Dr. Stevens
sighed and frowned at Brooke before pulling a chair over so that he could sit
and talk to the young girl, face to face.</p>
<p>"Brooke, you understand the scope of her injuries, don't you?" At the solemn
nod, he continued. "OK, well, let's review some of them anyway. Her pelvis was
shattered in the accident. It took a lot of pins and plates to put it back
together. She had a compression fracture of two vertebrae in her back, also
requiring metal rods and pins to hold in place to heal."</p>
<p>"I know all this," Brooke snapped. Dr. Stevens nodded.</p>
<p>"I know you do, Brooke. But knowing on paper what someone's injuries are
does nothing to help you comprehend the amount of pain and agony those injuries
cause them." Brooke swallowed hard, finding it difficult to do so past the large
lump of nausea that had settled in her throat.</p>
<p>"We are bringing her around slowly, Brooke," he continued. "But it's going to
take a while. She won't just open her eyes and start talking normally like they
always show you in the movies or on TV. It'll be a gradual process, a little
each day. You have to be patient and let Sam come around in her own time. It's
not going to be easy for her. She's still in pain. The bulk of her minor
injuries may be healed but there are other, deeper wounds that are still fresh."</p>
<p>"What about...what about the blood clot?" Brooke asked, barely above a
whisper. It weighed heavy on her mind, the head injury that Sam had suffered.
Brooke often wondered about things like whether or not Sam would remember
anything or suffer from amnesia. Would Sam be brain damaged and need special
help? All different scenarios had played out in her mind in the time since the
accident.</p>
<p>Dr. Stevens shrugged.</p>
<p>"Until she's awake and coherent, we really won't know for sure, Brooke," he
told her honestly. "But our tests so far show that there isn't any obvious brain
damage. Hold to that. Stay positive."</p>
<p>"I'll try," she said sadly. Dr. Stevens gave her a pat on the shoulder as he
stood up.</p>
<p>"You're taking great care of her, Brooke. I have no doubt that you're the
reason why she's holding on so tightly. She will come back to you. You just
have to believe." Brooke nodded and let the doctor leave the room. She turned
back to the prone and still silent form on the bed.</p>
<p>"Hear that, Sammy? You're coming back to me," she whispered lovingly. "Don't
make a liar out of him."</p>
<p align="center">**</p>
<p>Hazel eyes watched intently as slightly cloudy brown eyes flickered open
again, not staying exposed long but long enough for Brooke to peer in. For
nearly three months she waited patiently for a sign of life from Sam and now
those beautiful brown eyes were finally alive again, if only for fleeting
moments. She stroked at Sam's warm cheek, the bruises all but faded now and
tried to coax her further into consciousness.</p>
<p>"Wakey wakey, Sammy, love," she whispered into Sam's ear. "You've slept long
enough. Time to open your eyes and see what's going on around you." </p>
<p>Again, long lashes fluttered open and for the first time in the two weeks
since the incidents began, Sam's eyes stayed open. Brooke felt her heart leap
to her throat.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" she called quietly. She watched as Sam's eyes seemed to roam over
their surroundings but settled on nothing. Slowly, Sam frowned and her eyes
closed as she whimpered.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy, I'm right here," she cooed trying to soothe Sam's sudden
alarm. Sam's body tensed on the bed for a moment and she seemed to panic.</p>
<p>"Sam, Sam calm down," Brooke comforted, caressing Sam's cheek again. "Listen
to my voice, don't panic. It's OK, just listen to my voice." She felt Sam lean
into her touch and her heart soared. A few tears escaped past Sam's closed lids
into Brooke's palm.</p>
<p>"Why are you upset, Sammy? Do you hurt? Should I get the doctor?" Brooke
was beside herself with worry. But soon after, Sam seemed to relax again and
her eyes opened once more. They stared at the ceiling, blinking occasionally
but never moved towards Brooke.</p>
<p>"There's my Sammy," Brooke smiled. "I've missed looking into your eyes. And
now I know you're coming back to me."</p>
<p>A little while later, Brooke called Jane and Mike to tell them that Sam's
eyes were open but that she still seemed unaware of her direct surroundings.
Both parents were ecstatic to hear about the progress and were on their way to
see for themselves. She then called Lily and told her, asking the excited and
relieved Latina to please pass the news on to their friends. She hung up the
phone and turned back to Sam who was still lying silent on the bed, staring at
the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Baby steps, Sammy," Brooke encouraged. She hit the buzzer above Sam's head
to notify the nurses and then sat back down. "First, open your eyes and come
back to yourself. Then come back to me."</p>
<p>"Hey, Brooke, you hit the buzzer?" Nurse Angela Cox asked as she entered the
room. She approached the bed and noticed immediately the change in Sam's
condition. "Well, hello there, Sam. Coming around, are you?" She checked Sam's
vitals while Brooke watched intently, looking for any sign of news from the
nurse. Sam blinked but didn't seem to really register Angela's presence.</p>
<p>"Well?" Brooke asked anxiously. "This is good, right?" Angela spared her a
small smile.</p>
<p>"Any progress towards consciousness is good, Brooke," she assured the worried
blonde. The young girls devotion to the injured brunette was nothing short of
inspiring. Day in and day out, Brooke had been by Sam's side waiting for the
day when the hurt girl would wake up, never knowing when or even if that day
would arrive. Even when the nurses had their doubts, Brooke never lost faith.</p>
<p>"I guess," Brooke agreed. "Our parents are on the way over. I hope I didn't
raise their hopes for nothing."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you didn't," Angela said as she shined her penlight into Sam's
eyes. "Hmmm."</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke asked suddenly worried. Angela smiled at her.</p>
<p>"Relax, Brooke, before you worry yourself into a stroke at 17," she joked.
"It's nothing. I'm going to call Dr. Stevens and tell him that Sam's waking
up. He'll want to take a look at her as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"All right." Brooke grasped Sam's limp hand tightly in her own. Angela left
the room again, leaving Brooke alone. She watched Sam's face, devoid as it was
of expression as the brunette kept staring blankly at the ceiling. She knew Sam
could hear her but she wanted Sam to SEE her. So she stood up, placed herself
right in Sam's line of vision and waited for a reaction.</p>
<p>"Hiya Sammy," she whispered lovingly as she looked into Sam's open eyes. But
those eyes that were once so lively and mischievous were unfocused and somewhat
dull. Brooke's heart ached in her chest as Sam was unresponsive to her. She
didn't know what was worse now; Sam being unconscious or this semi-conscious
state she seemed to have entered. She leaned down and softly placed her lips
over Sam's before sitting back down.</p>
<p>Silent tears raced down both their faces in a strange sense of symmetry and
shared despair. </p>
<p>"It'll be OK, Sammy. I promise."</p>
