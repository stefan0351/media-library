<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - A Compass Always Points North -->

<p>Sam looked over at Brooke sunning herself on the dock a few days later and
smiled. (Damn that girl is sexy) she thought to herself, her smile widening.
(And all mine too. What did I ever do right to deserve her?) </p>
<p>"Enjoying the sun, Princess?" Sam asked as she walked over to Brooke's
lawnchair. Brooke opened one eye and squinted at her jeans and t-shirt clad
lover who was also wearing a backpack. </p>
<p>"Yup. Aren't you hot, Sammy?" Brooke asked. She was in a bathing suit sunning
herself while Sam looked ready for farm work. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nah," Sam answered. "I'm going on a hike, wanna come?" Brooke's eyes got
wide and she all but sprung from her chair. </p>
<p>"Give me a sec to change and I'll be right with you," she dashed for the
cabin, knowing where Sam was hiking to. They'd put it off until they both felt
better and Brooke was ecstatic that Sam finally felt like hiking to the stream.
She pulled on a pair of sweats over her suit and a tee and sneakers and ran out
the door to where Sam waited smiling. </p>
<p>"Ready to go, Princess?" she extended her hand which Brooke gladly took. </p>
<p>"When you are," she answered. Sam pulled her in for a passionate kiss and
then started walking. They walked in compatable silence for a while before Sam
started talking. </p>
<p>"Used to be when my Dad took me on this hike, he'd tell me stories about
these woods," she started, her eyes glancing around her in remembrance. Brooke
watched Sam as she went through her memories of her father, knowing how precious
the memories were to Sam and honored that Sam was sharing them with her. </p>
<p>"He'd tell me stories about Indians, oops, excuse me, Native Americans," Sam
grinned at her. "And bears and cougars. I don't know if he made them up or what
but I just loved to hear his voice. It just sort of echoed above the trees and
whirled all around us until we were the only two people on the planet." </p>
<p>"Like yours is now," Brooke whispered as she pulled up close to Sam. Sam
laughed slightly and held on tighter to Brooke's hand. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, I could just listen to him for hours. He'd tell me
stories about when he was little and about what it was like before I was born.
And then he'd tell me about the things that we were going to do when I got old
enough," her voice took on a sad tone for a moment and Brooke's heart broke for
her and what she had lost. </p>
<p>"It made the walk seem shorter. You know how long walks seemed when you were
little? You just wanted to GET there, but not with my Dad. Not when he was
telling one of his stories. It always seemed that we got there too soon." </p>
<p>"Mom never went with you?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, she called it `our time', Dad and me. She'd stay at the cabin and cook
or something and let us have the afternoon." </p>
<p>"That was really sweet of her," Sam nodded. They crested a small hill and
Brooke realized that they were there. (Seems Sam has the same talent her father
did) </p>
<p>Below them was the field that she had seen when God had let her visit Sam
during her coma. And it was even more beautiful in real life than it had been in
the limbo of Sam's coma. There was a lush green field through the middle of
which ran a small stream with a small wooden bridge. </p>
<p>"Wow, Sam, I don't think you distorted it at all," Brooke breathed. When Sam
didn't answer her, she tore her eyes away from the gorgeous view to check on her
brunette girlfriend and found her crying silently. </p>
<p>"What's wrong Sam?" Brooke asked suddenly worried. Sam turned to her and gave
her a brilliant smile despite her tears. </p>
<p>"Nothing. Absolutely nothing," she answered her smile never wavering. "I just
haven't been back since Dad died. I never wanted to. It's just like I remembered
it." Brooke realized the tears were tears of pure joy and hugged Sam tightly.
</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go down to the water," Brooke tugged on Sam's arm and pulled
her down the hill. They got to the water's edge and looked at their reflection.
For half a second, Sam swore she saw her father smiling back at her. She looked
around in surprise getting Brooke's attention. </p>
<p>"What, Sammy? What is it?" Sam looked around another second with a confused
frown but then shook her head and smiled. </p>
<p>"Nothing, just a memory, I guess," she shrugged. Brooke looked around. </p>
<p>"Too bad we didn't bring a blanket or something. This'd be a great place for
a picnic," she sighed. Sam looked at her and arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Now, what kind of girlfriend would be if I didn't think of everything?" she
teased as she slipped the backpack off. She opened it and pulled out a small
blanket, which she set out on the ground with a flourish. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"My, my, aren't you the clever one?" she asked. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"Wait, that's not all," she reached back into the bag and pulled out several
tupperware packets of food. "Lunch, milady?" she bowed. Brooke bowed back and
sat down as Sam set out the food and plates. Set out before her was a modest
lunch of chicken breast sandwiches, potato salad, corn chips and a couple of
sodas with fruit salad for dessert. Brooke smiled to herself, for all of her
anorexia problems, for Sam she was willing to try and get through it. </p>
<p>"Have I told you lately how much I love your cooking?" Brooke asked in all
seriousness after they finished eating. Sam blushed. "No, really, when did you
learn?" </p>
<p>"Well, it was out of necessity, actually. Brian and Jess Brahm aren't exactly
homebodies so it was either learn to cook or starve to death," Sam instantly
winced at her choice of words. Brooke reached over and covered her hand with her
own. </p>
<p>"It's OK, I understand what you meant," she said with an understanding smile.
"That explains why you resembled a stick figure when you busted in like
gangbusters that day." Sam's jaw dropped open and Brooke grinned. "Oh, like I'm
not gonna notice that you lost a few pounds. I happen to like where your curves
are, thank you." Sam blushed again. "You're so cute when you blush." </p>
<p>"Only when I blush?" Sam retorted with a smirk. Brooke snorted at her. </p>
<p>"OK, all the time, I admit it. You're beautiful, Sam," she whispered
seriously. Sam leaned across the blanket and kissed her. </p>
<p>"So are you, Brooke. I love you so much," Sam breathed almost as a prayer
making Brooke shiver. She grasped Sam's face in her hands and stared into Sam's
chocolate eyes with were looking back at her full of love and devotion. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Sam," she answered. She kissed her way along Sam's jawline
and heard Sam sigh in contentment. As they lay back on the blanet together,
hands beginning to explore, Sam pulled Brooke's face back up to look her in the
eye again. </p>
<p>"Are you sure about this, Brooke?" she asked, voice full of love and concern.
Brooke smiled and placed a gentle kiss on Sam's lips. </p>
<p>"If you are," she answered back. The searing kiss that ignited every nerve
ending in her body she got in response erased any doubt in Brooke's mind. </p>
