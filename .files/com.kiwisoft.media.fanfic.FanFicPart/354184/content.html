<!-- The Sentinel \ Part 8 -->

<p>Babies are funny little things, so needy, so cute.  And they're great  to play with as long as they're not your own.  That's why having a  wee tiny little sister was perfect for me, all the perks and none of  the hassles.  I got to dress her up in cute little outfits that would  humiliate her later in life, and play peek-a-boo with her impressing  myself with my ability to outsmart her, and when her diapers got  messy I suddenly had something to do and Jane or dad got to take of  it.</p>

<p>We were having a family gathering of sorts, sitting in the family  room watching some lameo movie from like the eighteen hundreds that  the parentals liked when they were our age.  I didn't mind though,  even though the movie blew it was nice to be in a family setting and  actually feel like a family.  For the first time in as long as I  could remember I felt like I was part of a real family, sure it was a  real nuclear family, but that didn't matter, it was all peaches to me.</p>

<p>"Brooke dear, you're going to make her air sick," I heard Jane say as  Little Mac just completed a super duper loop de loop compliments of  yours truly.</p>

<p>"Nah uh," I responded nonetheless resting the baby on my knees.  "She  like's it.  Don't you like it Little Mac?" I asked her in a baby  voice as she giggled at me and tried to suck on my thumb.  "It's a  bird, it's a plane," I continued picking her up again and flying her  like a miniature, bald version of Superman, "it's Captain Little  Mac," I concluded as Little Mac gave me a flying ovation, clapping  her hands together and giggling.</p>

<p>Turning my head to the side I could Sam looking between me and her  mother with a soft little grin on her face, it made my smile grow.</p>

<p>"As long as you're willing to be her airsick bag," Jane responded  giving me an impish little smile.  Now I knew where Sam got it from.   I was sure that I was as powerless against the charm of the McPherson  grin as my dad was.  That was alright by me, it's nice when parents  and children have something in common.</p>

<p>I stuck my tongue at Jane playful smirking as she pretended to pinch  it before turning back to McKenzie who was starting to look rather  board.  The child had a shorter attention span than Mary Cherry.</p>

<p>Thinking about Mary Cherry usually brought my mind careening towards  the subject of Nicole, a subject that I was usually against  discussing with myself let alone other people.  I sometimes wondered  why she did, how things could have gone so horribly wrong, how my  best friend could try and kill me.  At first I used to wonder about  things I could have done, if I missed anything in the days before the  accident, what I could have possibly done to turn her.  But  eventually, with more than a little help my brown haired guardian, my  sentinel, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't me, it was Nicole.   Mostly when I thought of her after that I felt pity and sadness, and  even a little anger, anger at the world that turned the sweet girl  she had once been, the girl I admit I saw vestiges of long after it  had vanished in most peoples eyes, into an attempted murderer.</p>

<p>I may have continued with thoughts like that as I sat there with  McKenzie on my lap, but I saw Sam move out the corner of my eye, and  helplessly – it was always helplessly – I turned my full attention to  her.  Our eyes met for a brief moment, and I could see something in  them, turmoil I guess.  She turned away from a second later though  and mumbled something about having seen this one before then headed  up the stairs.  I stayed, and played with Little Mac for a more  minutes, didn't want to make anyone suspicious after all, then I too  got up telling them that I just thought it was boring, and headed up  the stairs.</p>

<p>Sam was lying on her bed staring up at the ceiling as I knocked  lightly at her door.  She made a big, dramatic, and utterly cute  presentation of pondering whether or not to let me in, and then  nodded solemnly granting me permission.</p>

<p>"Mac was beginning to look a little green around the gills so I gave  her back to the parentals," I said stepping into the room and closing  the door behind me.  </p>

<p>I waited a few moments for a response, but it soon become clear to me  that I wasn't going to get one so I walked over to her bed and after  tossing my cane onto the ground I settled myself in an almost  identical position.  Once I was settled I turned to my so that I was  looking at her, and spent precious moments just watching her  profile.  She was the most beautiful person I had ever laid eyes on.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" I asked still unable to look away.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she responded refusing to turn in my direction.   Truthfully I had expected that answer, of the many things Sam was  stubborn was high on the list.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you," I told her shifting my position once again  until I was able to rest my head on her shoulder.  "I think  something's been bothering you for a while, and you're going to tell  me what it is."  </p>

<p>I felt her body raise as I said this, she had just taken a  tremendously big breath.  I think I was frustrating her, but that was  just too bad for her, because quite frankly sometimes people need  other people to tell them what's best for them, and at that moment  Sam was one of those people in need.  I would provide for her, just  like she provided for me, that's how it was, I called it love.</p>

<p>"It's not that simple," she finally breathed out sounding rather  irritated at my lack of understanding.  Or maybe she was just  distracted; sometimes with Sam it was hard to tell, almost as if  being distracted irritated her or something.</p>

<p>"The important stuff usually isn't," I told her softly.  "I want to  help Sam, whatever it is," I went on lifting my head off of her  shoulder and placing it in the palm of my hand so that I could see  her better.  "I care about you, I don't want to see you in pain."  As  I spoke, my hand snaked out was reaching out towards her face, I knew  what I wanted to do, what I longed to do.  To stoke that soft skin  soothingly, to place a kiss on her cheek and hug her until whatever  was haunting her went away.  But I drew my hand back.  That was my  dream, my demon, my secret, and this was about Sam.</p>

<p>"Brooke," she said saying my name in a sigh, "believe me when I say  that you really don't want to know what's bothering me."</p>

<p>"Sam," I said, my voice not wavering even the teeniest bit.  "Believe  me when I say that I really, really do want to know.  And, that I'm  not going to stop bothering you until you tell me or push me down a  flight of stairs," I went on.</p>

<p>"That's not funny," she said sharply as she turned to face me.</p>

<p>"It wasn't meant to be," I told her honestly.  "It was suppose to  show my dedication to helping you, even at high personal risk," I  went on.  It was suppose to show her my love.</p>

<p>She was quite for a moment, then she shifted so that it was now she  who was doing the mirroring.  Head in hand she looked at me.  First  at my face, then her eyes started to trail lower and lower lingering  for a moment here and there before continued down until she finally  raised her head to look into my eyes once more.  I was careful, as  she looked at me, careful not to squirm not to let on the effect that  it was having on me, not to show her how much I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"I…Brooke," she said shaking her head dejectedly.  "Look, just know  that…that I never meant any harm."</p>

<p>"Harm by what?"  I asked searching her eyes.  I'll admit that kind of  caught me off guard.</p>

<p>"By anything," was her response, then before I could even process  what was happening I felt her lips brush against mine gently before  she pulled back.  It seemed to last forever and for no time at all.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" I asked barely able to contain my excitement.  "That's  what was bothering you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you understand…" she started to same, but I reached  out a hand placing a finger over her lips gently `ssshhhhing' her.</p>

<p>"I think I do," I whispered taking my finger away from her  lips.  "Perfectly."  And with that I leaned forward and pressed my  lips against her, the contact firmer and much longer than the rather  chaste kiss Sam had given me moments before.  Sam leaned into me  increasing the contact between us and as she did I lifted my hand  bringing it around to the back of her neck, holding her head in place  as I continued to ravage her lips.  I gently ran my tongue along her  bottom lip, tasting her when she parted her lips allowing me more  access to her mouth.</p>

<p>I rested my hand on her hip as we continued to explore each others  mouths fiercely, my hand trailing up her side, softly brushing across  the side of her breast on its way back up to her neck.  As I did she  this, she gasped and arched her body against mine, crushing her lips  against mine much to our mutual delight.</p>

<p>"Okay," I heard her whisper as she separated, "maybe you do  understand," she continued her lips curving up into a sexy smile that  I couldn't help but return.</p>

<p>"If it's okay with you," I said reaching out and this time actually  stroking her cheek.  "I'd like to understand a little more."</p>

<p>She dipped her head down and scooted closer to me so that we were now  practically lying breast to breast, then she looked up at me  playfully.  "Let's learn about each other, baby," she said  lecherously before leaning in once more and pressing our lips  together.  "Yeah."</p>
