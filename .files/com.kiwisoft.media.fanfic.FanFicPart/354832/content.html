<!-- World Without Love \ Part 2 -->

<h4>Two hours later</h4>

		<p>"Seven?" B'Elanna asked innocently without turning away from her task. She wanted to ask Seven what was bothering her, but ... Instead of an answer she got ... a song.</p>

		<p><i>As I walk this land of broken dreams<br>
		I have visions of many things<br>
		Love's happiness is just an illusion<br>
		Filled with sadness and confusion</i></p>

		<p>She was doing it again, Seven was singing. B'Elanna watched her from the other end of the Jeffries tube, where she was still trying to find this darned chip. Seven was at the other end of the tube, trying to find the chip, too, but obviously her mind was not completely on the task.</p>

		<p><i>What becomes of the broken-hearted<br>
		Who had love that's now departed<br>
		I know I've got to find<br>
		Some kind of peace of mind, maybe</i></p>

		<p>This song B'Elanna didn't know, but the lyrics sounded sad and desperate. Seven sounded sad and desperate. Singing with so much passion, she seemed to have forgotten about B'Elanna being with her in the Jeffries tube. For the half-Klingon know for sure Seven would not knowingly expose herself so much in front of the chief engineer, who in the past had been more of an enemy than anything else to her.</p>

		<p><i>The fruits of love grow all around<br>
		But for me they come tumbling down<br>
		Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger<br>
		I can't stand this pain much longer</i></p>

		<p>'This animosity is something I am going to end', B'Elanna silently decided. Seeing Seven so unusually emotional had changed her perception of the former Borg. Seven was without a doubt human, with human emotions, there was no longer a "Tertiary adjunct to Unimatrix 01". Just a young woman trying to rediscover her humanity. This time B'Elanna did not try to convince herself, that this was still the 'old Seven', for in her heart she knew she had been wrong before.</p>

		<p><i>I walk in shadows searching for light<br>
		Cold and alone, no comfort in sight<br>
		Hoping and praying for someone to care<br>
		Always moving and going nowhere</i></p>

		<p>'Wow B'Elanna you sure have changed your mind fast, just two-times hearing her sing and two hours silently working together and you want to be her friend?' An annoying little voice inside her spoke. 'A few hours ago you hated her' the voice spoke on. 'I didn't hate her I just ... didn't like her very much', she argued the annoying voice.</p>

		<p><i>What becomes of the broken-hearted<br>
		Who had love that's now departed<br>
		I know I've got to find<br>
		Some kind of peace of mind, baby</i></p>

		<p>"Oh great now I am talking...eh thinking to myself" B'Elanna murmured under her breath as to not to interrupt the singing that had her thinking so much about the singer.</p>

		<p><i>I'm searching though I don't succeed<br>
		But someone look, there's a growing need<br>
		Oh she is lost, there's no place for beginning<br>
		All that's left is an unhappy ending</i></p>

		<p>Once again having completely forgotten her work, she stared at the singing Seven, no longer shocked to see the beautiful ex-Borg sing, but captivated by the beautiful and passionate voice.</p>

		<p><i>Now what becomes of the broken-hearted<br>
		Who had love that's now departed<br>
		I know I've got to find<br>
		Some kind of peace of mind</i></p>

		<p>There it was again, the pained look in Seven eyes, B'Elanna rather felt it than really saw it, but she knew it was there. B'Elanna wondered what was wrong with Seven, but could not even really guess, she just didn't know the woman enough, to know what could be bothering her. Having only a day before thought that nothing could bother the impeccable drone.</p>

		<p><i>I'll be searching everywhere<br>
		Just to find someone to care<br>
		I'll be looking every day<br>
		I know I'm gonna find a way</i></p>

		<p>Perhaps the answer lay in the songs she had heard Seven sung. It had been songs about love and the search for it. Was Seven in love? Was that the reason for her singing this songs, with so much emotion? If she was, then she was obviously not happy, when the songs she choose to sing were any indication.</p>

		<p>'Or perhaps she is just feeling a little lonely.' Anyway, B'Elanna was determined to find it out.</p>

		<p><i>Nothing's gonna stop me now<br>
		I will find a way somehow</i></p>

		<p>That was all the encouragement she needed. "Seven?" B'Elanna carefully began.</p>
