<p><b>Chapter Four: Zombie Slayer's Friends.</b></p>
<p>The next day of school commenced like any other. Lilly, Oliver and Miley stood by their lockers in the corridor laughing about something. However, one change did happen. Zombie Slayer, Jake Ryan approached Miley carefully, greeted her and received a friendly greeting. Although she did give him a warning look but he understood what she meant.</p>
<p>Today, Jake Ryan would try to help Miley and Lilly become a couple an he would do it as Miley's friend expecting nothing more from her.</p>
<p>He had a fervent belief that she wasn't attracted to him because she liked girl, he was only half right. She just didn't like his attitude or his existence. It didn't matter anymore though, because today they were starting their new friendship.</p>
<p>Before a new conversation topic could be established the first bell rang, signalling morning homeroom.</p>
<p>"We better get going." Oliver said, walking off with the other hoards of people into the direction of their homeroom classrooms.</p>
<p>Lilly walked with Oliver but Jake pulled Miley back. She allowed him, though inside she was a nervous wreck. She was horribly scared that he had changed his mind and he wanted to spread mean rumours about her around school and all of Malibu.</p>
<p>"Miley, I'll just be quick," he smiled his award winning smile that could melt any girls heart. Just letting you know that I'm not going back on what I said. I will try to get you and Lilly together."</p>
<p>Miley smiled nervously before replying. "Thanks Jake. Now hurry up, we're late for homeroom!" she grabbed his hand and pulled him into the direction of their classroom. The whole corridor was empty, bar them.</p>
<p>The rest of the day leading up to lunch went as smoothly as ever. The stress of school of course, ever president.</p>
<p>During lunch Jake approached Miley, Lilly and Oliver at the table the trio sat at regularly. However he was taken away by two teachers who had claimed it urgent for him to see the Principal.</p>
<p>Lunch turned into last period quite quickly and Jake was still yet to be seen since the incident at lunch. During this period a number of things happened earning Miley, Oliver and Lilly a serious trip to Mr Correlli after school.</p>
<p>Miley was swinging on her chair at the very front of the class when Amber and Ashley came up to her.</p>
<p>"We think it's adorable that you and Lilly are a couple Miley. You really are the best school dykes ever." Ashley said rudely.</p>
<p>Usually Miley would have an equally harsh comeback to say, however she was so taken aback from this comment an how close to the truth it could be, she merely toppled back with her chair, crashing into Oliver's table and onto him. Oliver then flew back into Lilly, who in turn crashed into Sarah. Luckily, the chain of toppling students, chairs and tables stopped there.</p>
<p>"Opps, did we do that?" Amber and Ashley said at the same time. They then had to do their stupid finger thing, and laughed evilly before walking away.</p>
<p>Yes, it was just another normal day of school.</p>
