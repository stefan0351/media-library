<P><B>ahhh! you guys are like the coolest people on the planet! i woke up this morning and had 11 reviews! so seriously and sincerely, thank you :)</B></P><P><B>oh, and by the way, i have 30 out of my 35 hamlet lines memorized! (i know that probably none of you care, but i'm pretty darn excited to almost be done) :D</B></P><P>To be or not to be, that is the question.</P><P>Hamlet tends to babble on for too long, so this is about as much as I got out of that whole monologue deal. Although, it could pertain to my life.</P><P>To be gay, or not to be gay, that is the question.</P><P>Although, I guess there's not really any question here, since I don't have a choice. My only choice is to embrace or ignore; there's no option for being straight anymore. I figured that out las week when Lilly mentioned some breasts and the picture never left my mind. That weekend, I headed to the beach, just so I could test out Lilly's distraction theory. Guess what: she's right. You can't possibly concentrate on anything with a bunch of girls in bikinis tanning, or strutting their stuff down the beach, or bounching and splashing around with their friends in the water. God, boys don't even need to look at porno when they're home alone. All they need to do is go to the beach. Girls are touchy-feely enough that it's like watching live porno. Although, that does make it difficult to get off, which is most boys' goal while watching porn anyway.</P><P>Where did they get the name porn anyway? It sounds either like a band or a nasty yellow vegetable. Why name it porn?</P><P>These are the questions that haunt me.</P><P>I listened to that Katy Perry song the other day, my new lesbian feelings in mind, and one verse stuck out at me.</P><P><I>Us girls we are so magical</I></P><P><I>Soft skin, red lips, so kissable</I></P><P><I>Hard to resist, so touchable</I></P><P><I>Too good to deny it</I></P><P>I think she definitely had the right idea. I think I should stop trying to deny it. Because obviously, as I've seen over the course of a few weeks, these feelings are not going anywhere. And it's taking too damn much energy to try and think about stuff other than beach babes. And God knows I'm lazy; this whole exerting-energy-just-to-be-straight bit is starting to not seem all that worth it. I mean, look at Lilly, she's all out and proud and she's fine. Same with Oliver. And they're probably a lot happier being able to still have sex, whereas I haven't had any action since Lilly moved in. Ugh.</P><P>"Miley? You almost ready to go?" Today is Saturday, and Lilly's AIDS Awareness Rally is being held at the community center. She roped me into going, even though I could think of a million better things to do. Then, however, she told me to list them. Turns out, I actually had zero better things to do.</P><P>"Yeah, just gimme a sec," I replied, putting the final touches on my wardrobe. It's not quite as scary today, sadly. I'm wearing a black ACDC t-shirt, black fishnet leggings under a dark purple tutu, black high-top converse, and my leather jacket I got for Christmas last year. About the first useful Christmas present I've gotten for 4 years.</P><P>"Oh, you look lovely," Lilly commented when I opened the bathroom door.</P><P>I couldn't tell if it was sarcasm or not, so I asked. "Sarcastic, or no?"</P><P>"Does it really matter? Either way, it's not like you're gonna change."</P><P>"True. Let's go."</P><P>We shuffled out of our room, heading towards the living room to leave. I should've known it wouldn't have been as easy as just walking out. It wasn't difficult for me, though. Shockingly, it was Lilly that got in trouble.</P><P>"Lillian, I wish you wouldn't do these things," Heather (AKA Blondie, for those of you who just got used to me calling her that) sighed.</P><P>"Do what things, Mother?" That was the first time I'd ever heard Lilly use an ounce of disrespect towards her mother. I guess I'm rubbing off on her, too.</P><P>"These gay events. It's bad enough you traipse around with other girls, acting like it's normal. Now you have to go organizing these activities to draw even more attention to yourself? Can't you just stop parading around the fact that you're abnormal?" My jaw dropped. No way. No fucking way. I totally thought Lilly and her mom got along fantastically. I've never seen them fight the whole time they've been here. Until now.</P><P>"Who gets to decide what normal is? Maybe who I am is normal and you're the freak. Come on, Miley. Let's go to my 'gay event.' Wouldn't want to keep the fellow abnormals waiting."</P><P>We headed for the door when my dad called out, "Miley, come here for a second."</P><P>"Go ahead, I'll wait for you in the car," Lilly told me before heading out the door.</P><P>I turned back to my dad. "What?"</P><P>"I don't want you going to that gay rally."</P><P>I actually laughed. Really, I did. I chuckled. "Dad, since when do I do what you want me to do?"</P><P>"Miley Ray, I know you have no respect for me whatsoever, but I do have your best interests at heart. It's not good for you to hang out with those types of people."</P><P>"<I>Those types of people? </I>What, do they suddenly have leprosy? God, you two are ignorant. I know you had to hike up a steep hill for three miles in the snow just to get to your shoes to get to school, but I'm sure once you got there they taught you to get along. I know it's been a longass time since you went to school, you being anciently old and everything, but try real hard to jog that old senial memory of yours. You work on that while I'm gone. I'm sure it will take you that long."</P><P>So maybe it wasn't the most clever of retorts, but at least it pissed them off. That's always what I aim for.</P><P>When I got out to the car, Lilly didn't even glance in my direction. She just stepped on the accelerator and backed out of the driveway. I know it's idiotic, but I kind of felt like she was mad at me, even though I know it was her mom. Soon to be my step-mom. Fuck, now I'm Cinderella with the damn evil step-mother.</P><P>"That's why I don't like being called a goody-two-shoes," Lilly said suddenly, breaking the silence of the car.</P><P>I was confused. "What do you mean?"</P><P>"That's all I ever got called, before I came out. 'Oh, Lilly's such a goody two shoes. She always does what she's told. Her mom must just love her.' What a load of shit. And this is all when I'm trying to figure out what I'm feeling and everything. When I was discovering my own lesbianism. When I was deciding when to come out. The pressure was ridiculous. They all expected me to do exactly what my mother wanted. They thought that's what I did. Then I figure out I'm the opposite of what my mom wants. That one name suddenly turned into a slap in the face."</P><P>Oh. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-"</P><P>"I know. It's okay. You didn't know."</P><P>"I always thought you and your mom were like, total besties!" I hitched my voice up to talk like a valley girl at the end.</P><P>She choked out a laugh. "Oh yeah, we're just so close. The homophobic mother and her lesbian daughter. We get along famously."</P><P>Lilly never failed to surprise me. Which is rare, considering that most of the time I find people to be fairly predictable and easy to read. For example, when Oliver walks out of his house when we pick him up, he'll be wearing a soft pink shirt that says Out & Proud and has a rainbow on it.</P><P>When we arrived at Oliver's hosue, he strutted out wearing a soft pink shirt that says Out & Proud with a rainbow on it. Did I call it or what?</P><P>...</P><P>The community center was actually pretty packed. I figured it would be deserted. I didn't know there'd be so many gay people showing up. I mean, yeah, it's California, but there's still a lot of bigotry.</P><P>"Wow, lots of gay people here."</P><P>"Not all of them are gay," Lilly reminded me, "AIDS isn't just a disease that affects gays. It affects everyone. That's one of the points we want to get across with this rally."</P><P>"Oh. Right. Sorry. Don't mind me and my table of one for ignorance over here."</P><P>"Nah, it's fine. Come on, you can work the informational booth with Oliver. I'll show you two where to go."</P><P>Oliver did not seem happy. "I know where to go thank you very much! I'm vice president of the GSA, in case you forgot!"</P><P>"Yeah, yeah. Then you and Miley go work the info booth. 'Kay?"</P><P>"Fine." Oliver and I said it simultaneously, which was just fucking weird, quite frankly. I've begun to notice that I fall deeper in with these two every second. Damn it. Ah, I guess it's not too bad. They're actually not as bad as I initially thought.</P><P>Oliver and I took our seats at the booth, relieving the two girls who were running it before we got there. As soon as we sat down he nudged me in the side. "Ow! What the hell?"</P><P>"You're such a big baby! Now, talk to me."</P><P>"About?"</P><P>He looked exasperated that I didn't immediately know what he was trying to get out of me. "Honey, come on. Don't tell me you forgot that little convo we had a while ago."</P><P>"What 'little convo'? You'll have to refresh my memory, I'm afraid."</P><P>He lowered his voice and leaned closer to me. "About your homosexuality."</P><P>I stiffened. Oliver noticed. "I'm pretty sure I already told you I'm not gay."</P><P><I>What happened to just accepting it?</I></P><P>Damn that little voice in my head. You know, it's beginning to bug me. Life was so much...quieter, without this dumbass conscience nagging me.</P><P>"Miley, take it from someone who knows: it's much easier to just accept it than to try to deny it. You'll torture yourself to insanity trying to push these feelings away. The gay teen suicide rate is much too high. I don't want to add you to that statistic."</P><P>"Jesus Christ, Oliver, overdramatic much? I'm not suicidal."</P><P>"Whatever. I'm just saying. Life will be much easier for you once you just accept it. You're gay. Quit trying to deny it and just deal."</P><P>Jack Twist was right, and I knew it. I'd already known it. It's just that implementing the idea is a little different than simply acknowledging it.</P><P>...</P><P>The rally was a huge success. Oliver didn't bother me about my own sexuality anymore after that one time. Our booth was super busy with people picking up pamphlets and asking for clarification on a few key points. The principal even came, and was shocked to fine me there.</P><P>"Miley Stewart," he had said, "So glad to see you being proactive. Maybe if you take on this new attitude with your schoolwork, you could graduate with the rest of your class in June."</P><P>Of course, Lilly had asked what he was talking about, so I'd told her I'd explain later. Unfortunately, that "later" I was referring to is now here.</P><P>"What was the principal talking about, Miley?" Lilly inquired, taking off her jewelry and setting it on her dresser.</P><P>I sighed exasperatedly. "Apparently, my grades and class participation and attendance are bad enough to where it looks like I won't be graduating."</P><P>"Oh my god! Miley, why didn't you tell me about this? I could help you!"</P><P>"I know. Look, it's not that big of a deal. He said if I turn it around this year I could still walk the stage with y'all. I just have to actually start going to classes and doing work."</P><P>Now she sighed. "You're a mess."</P><P>"I know this."</P><P>"Ugh," Lilly was struggling trying to unclasp a necklace behind her neck, "Miley, could you help?"</P><P>"I suppose so," I said, pretending to be all put out that she'd ask for my help.</P><P>I crossed the room stood dangerously close behind her. She held her hair up while I worked on the stubborn clasp. Finally, I broke it free, but neither of us moved. My breath was falling on her neck, blowing loose strands of her hair. She slowly let her blonde waves cascade down her back again, and swiveled slowly to face me.</P><P>"Thanks," she breathed.</P><P>"No problem," I replied.</P><P>Then, we both leaned in, and suddenly I found my lips pressed on hers. What the hell was I doing? I was kissing Lilly. I was kissing my soon-to-be step-sister. And I...I liked it. I enjoyed it.</P><P>Damn that Katy Perry.</P><P><I>I kissed a girl, and I liked it; the taste of her cherry chapstick.</I></P><P><B>so! how was it? let me know your thoughts! did it happen too soon? should i have waited longer to make them kiss, or is this okay? i mean, we all knew it was coming anyway. well, whether you loved it or hated it, review please! :D</B></P>
