<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part Seven -->

<p>Sam lay in her bed. The long brown hair was sprawled out across the white satin covers. She was sound asleep. Before going to sleep, the brunette had opened her bedroom window. In her sleep, she was now enjoying the soft caress of a warm summer night?s breeze.</p>
<p>Sam had always been a very light sleeper. This night was no exception. The soft creek emitted from the bathroom door as it slowly opened was enough to wake her up.</p>
<p>The brunette slowly lifted her head and looked at the figure entering her room. Even though the only light in the bedroom came from the waxing moon and the stars in the sky outside, Sam could easily tell that the person standing in the doorway was definitely a woman.</p>
<p>Sam brought her hand up and brushed a few strands of hair away from her face. She observed the figure through half-open eyes, trying to make out her face in the dim lighting.</p>
<p>The girl wore an almost transparent, mid-thigh negligee. She stood in front of the open window, and Sam could see the outline of soft curves, long legs and a slim waist through the thin material. Shoulder length, blonde hair gave off a silvery shine in the pale moonlight.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" The brunette said sleepily. "What..."</p>
<p>"Sshh..." The girl slowly walked to Sam?s bed and sat down next to the brunette. Gentle hands were placed on Sam?s shoulders, softly pushing her back onto the pillows.</p>
<p>"But..." Sam started to protest, but was silenced by a finger tenderly placed on her lips. Brooke leaned forward until her face was mere inches away from the brunette?s. Sam could feel how the blonde?s gaze bore right into her soul. The warmth and closeness of Brooke?s body made her breath quicken.</p>
<p>"No words." Brooke whispered as she shook her head slightly. Her finger left Sam?s lips and she tugged brown hair away from the confused face beneath her own. Gentle fingertips traced the outline of the brunette?s delicate features as Brooke slowly leaned closer to Sam.</p>
<p>"No words." Sam repeated and closed her eyes. A jolt of electricity flowed through the brunette?s entire body when she felt Brooke?s warm breath on her face. Every nerveending inside her seemed to come alive as soft, pink lips brushed against her own. Trembling hands reached out and cupped the cheerleader?s face while soft fingers tangled themselves in long brown tresses.</p>
<p>Brooke traced her tongue along Sam?s lower lip and let out a low moan as she felt the brunette?s lips part, accepting the invitation to deepen the kiss. The movement of their lips was slow at first. Carefully and tentatively they explored each other?s mouths, savoring the moment. As the need and desire grew inside of them, the kiss became more passionate, more demanding in its nature.</p>
<p>The brunette felt a pleasant shiver run down her spine as Brooke?s hands found their way inside her nightshirt. One hand gently tracing small circles on her torso, while the other slid to the beginning of her ribcage awaiting permission to go up further.</p>
<p>Without braking the contact between their lips, Sam let her hands move from Brooke?s cheeks, down across her shoulders, coming to a halt at the small of the cheerleader?s back. A desperate need to feel the blonde?s skin against her own overcame her, and in one swift motion Sam pushed Brooke back onto the bed and straddled her thighs.</p>
<p>Brooke gave a small gasp of surprise at the brunette?s sudden movement, but had no mind to object to the change of positions. Only a tiny whimper escaped her lips when Sam broke the kiss and straightened her back.</p>
<p>Chocolate brown locked with hazel as Sam began slowly unbuttoning her nightshirt. Both of them gazed intensely into the other?s eyes, marveling in the longing and desire hidden behind the darkened orbs.</p>
<p>When Sam finished unbuttoning her shirt, she remained in the same position. Her eyes fluttered shut for a moment as she felt Brooke?s hands slowly slide up her thighs, over her hips, past the gentle curve of her waist. The blonde?s hands continued their journey until they reached Sam?s shoulders, resting there for a split-second before gently pushing the shirt off. At the same time, Sam began inching the negligee up Brooke?s body, teasingly grazing her nails against the cheerleader?s silky skin as she did so.</p>
<p>Brooke lifted her upper body slightly and held her arms over her head, allowing the reporter to fully remove one of the last obstacles keeping them from feeling flesh against flesh. No sooner had Sam tossed the negligee into a corner of the room before the blonde?s hand grabbed her shoulders and pulled her down, claiming the brunette?s lips once again.</p>
<p>Hesitantly breaking the kiss, Brooke looked longingly into Sam?s eyes.</p>
<p>"Sam." She said.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" The brunette replied huskily.</p>
<p>"Sam?"</p>
<p>"What is it?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Sam!"</p>
<p>The brunette jolted upright in her bed, staring around her like a trapped animal. The bright Saturday morning sun was shining in through the window, making her squint due to the strong light. Brooke sat next to her on her bed, a sly grin draped across her face.</p>
<p>"Sorry to wake you." She smirked. "Sounded like you were having fun."</p>
<p>"Uh..." Was all Sam could manage to get out.</p>
