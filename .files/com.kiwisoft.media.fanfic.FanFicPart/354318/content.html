<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 48: Loose ends -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway returned to her quarters and wondered what she was going to
do about her two medical holograms. The Doctor seemed to be blowing a
holographic fuse and Opaca seemed to be having genuine emotions. Kathryn was not
a happy captain. She decided that if she had to have a ‘sensitive chat’ with a
hologram, she could at least be comfortable. She had just finished changing into
a pair of charcoal grey slacks and creme colored blouse when the door
chimed.</P>
<P>"Hello," Opaca said, smiling shyly when Kathryn opened the door. She seemed
slightly uneasy roaming the decks using the Doctor’s holo-emitter.</P>
<P>"Thank you for coming. Won’t you come in?" Kathryn led the short hologram to
the couch. "Would you like to sit? I’m sorry, I not even sure if you’re…umm…
programmed to socialize. What can I do to make you more comfortable?"</P>
<P>Opaca flopped down on the couch and shook her head. She had a half smile on
her lips. "Kathryn, I am a hologram. I don’t get uncomfortable… but thank
you."</P>
<P>"You certainly seemed uncomfortable when I came to sickbay today." Kathryn
sat next to her and curled one leg up under the other. "You seemed very
upset."</P>
<P>"I am programmed to appear as if I am experiencing concern." Opaca shifted
her weight and her eyes drifted as she looked around the room. Her eyes stopped
on a sculpture near the window and for a moment she looked very sad. "I am just
a tool, Kathryn, a piece of machinery like the transporter or your
replicator."</P>
<P>"I’ve seen holograms expressing programmed emotions. Yours seemed
more…genuine. Why do you think that is?" Kathryn could have said more didn’t.
She didn’t ask if Seven had spoken to Opaca, because the hologram’s reference to
the replicator was just like a conversation the captain had once had with the
former drone when they had quarreled about the Doctor’s sentience. She also
didn’t point out how she knew so much about holograms and faked emotions. The
Fairhaven disaster was still new in her mind. That was one can of Anterian
footlong worms she didn’t want to open.</P>
<P>Opaca paused before answering, then looked Kathryn in the eyes. Her deep
brown holographic eyes flickered with intensity. "Perhaps I am just a well
designed program. If you were to deactivate me… nothing would be lost except a
projection of light and energy."</P>
<P>"We’d lose more than that." Kathryn studied Opaca’s small hands. The hologram
was nervously wringing one hand with the other in her lap. "Seven and B’Elanna
care a great deal for you. They’d miss you, and so would the other patients
you’ve taken on."</P>
<P>"I think the world of Seven and B’Elanna," Opaca said with a wistful smile.
"As for the other patients…I don’t think the Doctor is very pleased about that
development."</P>
<P>"It’s only natural that the women of the crew would want a female physician
for their more…personal exams," Kathryn said as she cleared her throat. "I was
going to ask you to do my yearly physical next month," she added with a rueful
grin.</P>
<P>"You never volunteer for exams," Opaca said, looking honestly shocked. "Are
you ill?" She edged closer and took Kathryn’s wrist. Her touch was warm and
gentle as she moved her finger to the pulse point.</P>
<P>"No, just getting a bit less stubborn in my old age." Kathryn studied the
hand holding hers. "How do you know about my past aversion to physicals?"</P>
<P>Opaca looked up, for a moment her eyes were like a lamb looking at a lion,
and then she relaxed. "I am familiar with all of the crew’s medical
records."</P>
<P>For the first time since she had met the feisty hologram, Kathryn didn’t
believe her. "Are you sentient?"</P>
<P>Opaca laughed and leaned back into the couch. "I am sentient enough to know
that I am not sentient," she said as looked over at the captain. "Kathryn, the
Doctor was activated for several months before he showed any signs of sentience.
He also wanted to grow that way. Harry programmed me so that I don’t even want
to be sentient."</P>
<P>"Then he didn’t do a very good job." Kathryn’s eyes narrowed as she sent a
silent challenge to the other woman. "Because you are more sentient than the
Doctor, and you seem more human than he ever has."</P>
<P>"Don’t you mean Bajorian?" Opaca asked with an impish grin, trying to change
the subject.</P>
<P>"You know what I mean." Kathryn picked up Opaca’s hand and squeezed it. "You
have a pulse and body heat…and before you tell me that you were programmed to…I
don’t buy that answer. I’ve been…very close to a hologram, and they don’t feel
like this."</P>
<P>"I think this is about your experience with Sullivan. You are uncomfortable
because you like another hologram. It’s okay to have a holographic friend,
Kathryn." Opaca smiled warmly.</P>
<P>"Neither Harry nor the Doctor call me Kathryn. They wouldn’t have programmed
you to take such liberties. Why do you feel so comfortable doing it? And why
does it…feel right? I am very careful about whom I give permission to do that."
Kathryn raised an eyebrow and shook her head. "I never gave you that
permission."</P>
<P>"Maybe I’m just pushy," Opaca suggested.</P>
<P>"There are plenty of pushy people on this crew. None of them take that
liberty." Kathryn leaned back and studied Opaca. "Even Neelix, who doesn’t
always have a firm grasp on Starfleet custom, doesn’t call me by my first
name."</P>
<P>Opaca smiled at the mention of Neelix and she closed her eyes and bent her
head forward, as if remembering some private joke. "Neelix has rough edges but
he is not pushy…just… persistent," she said when she looked up.</P>
<P>"How do you know?" Kathryn challenged. "I’ve never seen you really talk to
him. In fact…when he is in the room…you avoid him." Kathryn’s eyes widened as an
idea formed in the back of her mind but she wasn’t quite ready to believe it
yet. Still, there were nagging clues. Opaca knew things that she shouldn’t about
the crew, especially Kathryn. Opaca had a gentle spirit that Kathryn recognized.
"Who are you?" she asked, her voice thick with emotion.</P>
<P>"I am a holo-…"</P>
<P>"Don’t lie to me," Kathryn said as she leaned closer and took Opaca’s hand.
"Who are you? You are not a hologram that only came into existence a few months
ago."</P>
<P>"You’re mistaken." Opaca pulled away and stood.</P>
<P>"You’re not one of the Q, that’s for sure," Kathryn said as she stood. "But
you are more than a projection of light and energy." She moved up behind Opaca
and rested a hand on her shoulder. "Who are you?" she asked in a whisper.</P>
<P>Opaca sighed and shook her head. "I am energy and light… just not all of it
is holographic," she finally said. "I never wanted to disturb this ship…this
crew." She turned and smiled warmly at the captain. "And I certainly never
wanted to make your life more complicated, Kathryn."</P>
<P>"Kes?" Kathryn whispered as she touched the hologram’s cheek. "My God, how
could I have missed it?"</P>
<P>A single tear slipped out of the hologram’s eye and fell from her cheek. It
disappeared as soon as it left her matrix, unable to stay cohesive once
separated from her holographic body.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Tach opened the door to his quarters and was startled when Seven barged in
and rushed past him followed closely by B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"I didn’t expect to see you two this soon," he said as he turned.</P>
<P>"Seven?" Nara asked, concerned by the fear in her friend’s eyes. The former
drone went to the portable sleeper next to the couch and gently scooped Kayla
out of it. The baby was sleeping, but even deep in the arms of Morpheus, she
knew her mama. She whimpered happily and snuggled into Seven’s chest.</P>
<P>"We just needed to see her." B’Elanna went behind Seven and wrapped her arms
around the willowy blonde. Seven seemed fragile, and B’Elanna felt almost as if
she were holding her wife from falling to pieces.</P>
<P>Seven hummed quietly as she rubbed Kayla’s back and inhaled her fresh, clean,
baby scent. "We needed to make sure she was all right," Seven whispered as she
turned to face Nara.</P>
<P>"She’s fine," Nara said as she went to Seven. "She was absolutely
perfect."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes darkened and shined with tears as she inhaled sharply. </P>
<P>B’Elanna’s hugged Seven tighter and murmured in her ear. "It’s just an
expression, love."</P>
<P>"What’s wrong?" Tach asked, quickly moving closer.</P>
<P>"Nothing…" Seven said. Her voice was pained and wounded. "There is nothing
wrong with her all."</P>
<P>"Then I think you’d better explain why you look like that’s a bad thing,"
Nara said as she squeezed Seven’s arm.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>After a brief explanation of the problem, Nara sat on the couch and shook her
head. "Leave it to you two to beat the system." Nara smiled warmly at her
friends. "It isn’t enough that you name your child after that perfect Klingon of
yours, you had to have her be perfect as well."</P>
<P>"We named her Kayla to honor her Klingon side and because we wanted to thank
Kahless for the miracle of her birth." Seven gave Nara and indignant glare. "We
would rather she be normal."</P>
<P>"Seven, she’s not abnormal," Nara pointed out. "She just doesn’t have any
defects to worry about."</P>
<P>"I would think you’d be happy," Tach said. "From the way you described these
nanoprobes, this is a minor problem considering all that could have gone wrong.
You should be thankful that your child is healthy."</P>
<P>"We are," B’Elanna said. She rubbed Seven’s back with her hand as she spoke.
"We just didn’t want Kayla to face anymore prejudice than she already will."</P>
<P>"It is bad enough that she has a Borg mother," Seven said quietly.</P>
<P>"Seven, my beloved," B’Elanna said with a sad smile. "I meant because she’s
one quarter Klingon."</P>
<P>"So?" Seven asked. "I wish she could be more like you."</P>
<P>"And I wish she could be more like you." B’Elanna laughed.</P>
<P>"Enough," Nara said as she stood. "If you two don’t start being thankful for
the glorious gift of the goddess that this darling little girl is, I will take
her and raise her as mine. Tach and I won’t whine about what she isn’t. We will
love her for who she is." Nara tried to take Kayla, but Seven backed away.</P>
<P>"We do love her," Seven said angrily.</P>
<P>"We wouldn’t change her at all." B’Elanna stepped in front of Nara.</P>
<P>"Good," Nara said as she crossed her arms over her chest. "Now that we have
that settled… maybe you two can quit complaining and just love my niece."</P>
<P>B’Elanna sighed and shook her head. "You really are good at getting to the
heart of the matter, aren’t you?"</P>
<P>"Don’t even try to argue with her," Tach said. "This woman never loses."</P>
<P>"You are right," Seven said. "We are focusing on the wrong thing. Kayla is
all that matters and we love her exactly the way she is."</P>
<P>"Now," Nara said as she moved past B’Elanna. "Let me hold my little
sweetheart." She held her arms out.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said slowly. "But you had better give her back."</P>
<P>"Maybe." Nara smiled. "But I think she likes me," Nara added as she rocked
the sleeping child. "I always have wanted a boy and a girl."</P>
<P>"Then I suggest you speak to Tach," B’Elanna said. She wrapped her hands
around Seven’s waist. "Because we aren’t parting with ours. Tell Tach to toss
some X chromosomes your way."</P>
<P>"Like he ever listens," Nara said with a smirk.</P>
<P>Tach opened his mouth to answer but a muted beep from a small device on the
table cut him off. He jumped to his feet and headed toward the bedroom. </P>
<P>"Oh no you don’t," Tach said as he activated the lights.</P>
<P>B’Elanna followed as Nara handed the baby to Seven and then went to turn off
the beeping alarm. The lights came on and Ty turned toward them with a
determined look on his face. He saw the newcomers and squealed happily.</P>
<P>"Evan! Ba!" He ran toward them, dropping a data padd onto the floor.</P>
<P>"What are you up to, my son?" Tach scooped Ty up before he could get to his
aunts.</P>
<P>"Ty fixing." He squirmed to get down. "Ba," Ty said insistently as he reached
out for his beloved Klingon.</P>
<P>"Give him to me." B’Elanna smiled. "How’s my little tiger?" she asked as she
took him. He hugged her with his legs squeezing as tight as he could.</P>
<P>"Ba, no go away," he said when he loosened his grip.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry, tiger." B’Elanna kissed his forehead. "We have been pretty busy
with the baby."</P>
<P>"Evan’s baby is out. Kay-ya out now." Ty pointed to the former drone.</P>
<P>"Yep," B’Elanna said. She went over to her wife. "Kayla is your cousin." She
leaned against Seven’s shoulder so that Ty could get a good look at Kayla.</P>
<P>"Kay-ya leeping," he whispered.</P>
<P>Seven leaned into B’Elanna and kissed Ty’s head. "Yes, and you should be
sleeping as well."</P>
<P>"Ty fix," he explained.</P>
<P>"My son," Tach said as he took Ty from B’Elanna. "You leave the fixing to
your Fa, is that understood?"</P>
<P>"Ty fix." His sparkling brown eyes were determined and the stubborn
expression on his face looked exactly like Nara.</P>
<P>"No," Tach said. "Ty sleep."</P>
<P>"Ty go to Evan," he suggested.</P>
<P>"Ty is going back to bed," Tach said as he went to the sleeper in the corner.
B’Elanna followed, curiously looking over the small device that was circling
Ty’s sleeping area.</P>
<P>"Ty go to Ba." He squirmed as Tach put him under the covers.</P>
<P>"Tyranlanar, you are going to sleep," Tach said gently.</P>
<P>"What’s that?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Motion detector." Tach tucked in his son. </P>
<P>"Well, that’ll at least let you know when he gets loose." B’Elanna
laughed.</P>
<P>"Keep laughing, Just wait ‘til Kayla starts <I>fixing</I> things. I’m betting
that those Borg nanoprobes valued engineering skills. Kayla is gonna’ be fixing
things in no time."</P>
<P>"Ty help Kay-ya fix." Ty sat up and looked at Kayla in Seven’s arms.</P>
<P>"Oh, sweet Kahless." B’Elanna’s face paled.</P>
<P>"Kayla will not <I>fix</I> anything," Seven said with complete certainty. "We
will simply explain to her that she should not touch things unless she has our
permission."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah," Nara said as she began giggling. "That’ll work."</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow at Nara and shifted Kayla onto her shoulder.</P>
<P>Nara straightened her shoulders and gave Seven a half grin that looked just
like Kathryn when she was being sarcastic. "Janeway to Torres…" Nara said in a
very good impersonation of the captain’s deadliest tone. "Your daughter just
ejected the warp core…again." </P>
<P>"Oh, god." B’Elanna looked at her daughter. "We are in so much trouble."</P>
<P>"Yeah, you are," Tach agreed with a huge toothy grin.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway stared at the hologram that looked nothing like her dear
friend Kes, and yet, when she looked into her brown eyes, eyes too dark to be
Kes, she could see some spark that was the Ocampa. All of the questions about
where Kes had been and how she had gotten into the hologram didn’t matter. This
was Kes. Kathryn grabbed her and pulled her into an embrace, squeezing the
smaller woman.</P>
<P>"Kes," she whispered. "I’ve missed you so much." Kathryn’s voice cracked.</P>
<P>"I know," the hologram whispered. "I never meant to hurt you." She held onto
Kathryn, inhaling as she buried her face in the older woman’s hair.</P>
<P>"How?" Kathryn asked as she eased back. "How are you even here?"</P>
<P>"I…I was existing as pure energy, but I could see this reality. I tried to
contact you. Nothing I did worked." Opaca backed away and paced, hugging her
arms to her chest like Kes used to always do. "Not even Tuvok could sense me. I
saw all of the pain my leaving caused, and I wanted so much to help you."</P>
<P>"You’ve been watching us this whole time?" Kathryn asked. She moved closer,
studying the hologram’s movements.</P>
<P>"Not exactly." Opaca went to the couch and sat, waiting for Kathryn to join
her. "When you exist as energy, thought and action merge…one becomes the other.
If I wondered how my family and friends were doing on the homeworld, I was
suddenly there. I would stay there for a while, but at some point…I would miss
my home. Any thought of home transported me right back here…with you."</P>
<P>Kathryn nodded. "How much did you see?"</P>
<P>"Enough," she answered. "When I first changed, I watched you interact with
Seven. I knew there was something there…and I chose to go see what was happening
in the rest of the universe."</P>
<P>"You were uncomfortable seeing me with Seven?" Kathryn sighed and rubbed her
temples. "When Seven and B’Elanna came back married, it hurt incredibly. Nothing
had hit me that hard in years…not since…" her voice trailed off.</P>
<P>"Not since I left?" the hologram asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Kathryn whispered. She looked down at the cushions of the couch.</P>
<P>"Kathryn, I didn’t have a choice." The hologram reached out and lifted
Kathryn’s chin. "I didn’t want to go."</P>
<P>"How did you come back?" Kathryn asked as she enjoyed the warmth of the hand
cupping her chin.</P>
<P>Opaca laughed, and there was a lyric quality to the sound that was pure Kes.
"I wasn’t even sure I could merge with the hologram. It just occurred to me when
I was watching the Doctor and Harry constructing the matrix…that a hologram was
energy and light…just like me. Once they activated the program, I just bonded
with the energy matrix."</P>
<P>"Why doesn’t your energy disappear when the program deactivates?" Kathryn
asked. Her scientist's mind was scrambling, trying to grab any hard facts that
could explain the miracle. </P>
<P>"I have gotten pretty used to containing my energy, Kathryn." The hologram
sighed. "When I first left, and I used my energy to send <I>Voyager</I> clear of
Borg space…I was dazed for weeks. I was scattered across the entire distance
that I had moved <I>Voyager</I>. I don’t know that it was such a great idea."
She smiled sadly.</P>
<P>"You saved us all." Kathryn took the hologram’s hand in hers. "We would have
been assimilated for sure. Thank you."</P>
<P>"You’re welcome," Opaca smiled.</P>
<P>"But you seem different," Kathryn said. "You were swearing in sickbay…you
never swore before."</P>
<P>"That’s Opaca," she replied, rolling her eyes. "When I merged with the
matrix, I picked up a lot from her personality subroutines. I like to think she
added a bit of a spark to my own personality."</P>
<P>"So…are you Opaca…or Kes?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>"Both…neither…somewhere in the middle," the hologram said. "When I first
merged with this matrix I couldn’t even control the program. I was just sort of
along for the ride. Then, as time passed, I became more comfortable with the
matrix and started to be able to effect its…our…actions."</P>
<P>"What about now?" Kathryn asked. "Are you…Kes…in complete control?"</P>
<P>"Yes," the hologram said. "I am functioning within the matrix. Right now the
Opaca program and I have completely merged. Her personality has become a part of
me. Although…I sometimes think that isn’t always for the best. I used to be a
lot more forgiving of the Doctor."</P>
<P>"You do seem to have developed quite a temper," Kathryn said ruefully.</P>
<P>"Bajoran are known for that," Opaca said. "That temper has been the biggest
adjustment."</P>
<P>"What about the Doctor?" Kathryn asked. "Do you know what’s going on with
him?"</P>
<P>"Kathryn, he’s been through so much, and he doesn’t have anyone to talk to."
The hologram took Kathryn’s hand. "You helped him over his breakdown when he
remembered Ensign Jetty’s death… you and the crew did everything they could, but
he’s lost so much."</P>
<P>"We want to help him, Ke…Opa… I’m not sure what to call you," Kathryn
admitted.</P>
<P>"Call me Opaca. It will be best for everyone."</P>
<P>"Okay." Kathryn said warmly. "Opaca, we want to help him. But he has to let
us in."</P>
<P>"Think of all he’s lost." Opaca shook her head as she thought of the many
years the Doctor had been activated. "All his attempts to forge a romantic or
emotional bond have ended in heartbreak. He fell in love with a hologram from
the Beowulf program…she was the one who called him Schweitzer. She was killed.
He fell in love with Denara Pel, the doctor afflicted with the Phage, and he
lost her. Then when he tried to create a holographic family…"</P>
<P>"His daughter," Kathryn said as she remembered. "She died."</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said. "From there…well, he had feelings for me…and I left him.
And we can’t forget the fact that he is in love with Seven."</P>
<P>"She tends to inspire that," Kathryn said ruefully.</P>
<P>"Yes, she does." Opaca smiled, her brown eyes twinkling. "She’s an amazing
young woman."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna’s very lucky," Kathryn added.</P>
<P>"So is Seven," Opaca pointed out. "Those two are completely devoted to each
other. Though I was amazed when I first saw them together."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" Kathryn asked.</P>
<P>Opaca stood and walked to the window and looked out at the beautiful stars.
"Do you remember when Seven left <I>Voyager</I>, convinced that there was a
shipwide conspiracy against her?" She touched the cool transparent aluminum.</P>
<P>"Yes." Kathryn stood and went to the hologram’s side.</P>
<P>"I thought that you had finally come to your senses," Opaca said wistfully.
"I was there, with you when you bent down on one knee and asked her to stay."
She turned to Kathryn. "I thought you were ready to explore the feelings that
were growing between the two of you."</P>
<P>Kathryn shook her head. "I made a strategic retreat."</P>
<P>"You ran like a frightened child," Opaca corrected.</P>
<P>"I prefer my term," Kathryn said with a frown. "Why did you bring this
up?"</P>
<P>"It was difficult for me to see you…with her." Opaca leaned against the cool
glass, pressing her forehead against it, enjoying the sheer physicality of the
action. She pulled back and looked into Kathryn’s eyes. "I left. I didn’t want
to watch that. I came back expecting to see you and Seven in middle of a torrid
affair. I was surprised when I saw you with a hologram, and completely stunned
when Seven returned… married to B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Imagine what a shock it was to me." Kathryn sighed. </P>
<P>Opaca laughed. "I can only imagine. I was so shocked to see you with…that…"
She continued laughing. "I came back once while you were…with him."</P>
<P>"Oh, lord," Kathryn said as she covered her eyes. "Please tell me you didn’t
‘see’ me with that hologram."</P>
<P>"Of course not," Opaca said with a smirk. "I left as soon as I realized…"</P>
<P>"Oh, god, you did." Kathryn rubbed her temples as she felt herself blush.</P>
<P>"Anyway," Opaca said, trying to shift the conversation. "When I saw how much
you were hurting…I wanted to be there for you. Then, when Seven almost lost the
baby, I saw my chance with this," she said as she pointed to her holographic
body. "By merging with the matrix I had the opportunity to help the crew without
complicating things."</P>
<P>"Until I ruined your little party," Kathryn said with a half grin.</P>
<P>"I never could fool you," Opaca said. "Although, it sure took you long
enough." She smiled warmly at her friend.</P>
<P>"I wasn’t completely on my game," Kathryn said. "I was a little preoccupied
with that Sullivan…thing…and then with getting used to Seven and B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"I’m sorry I had to deceive you." Opaca rested her hand on Kathryn’s
shoulder. "I just didn’t want to hurt anyone…if the crew found out…it could be
painful."</P>
<P>"You mean Neelix," Kathryn said.</P>
<P>"Yes. He and I came to an understanding that we were not on the same path…
even before I…left, but he still cares for me a great deal." She smiled as she
closed her eyes. "He talks to me all the time. Tells me about his days,
discusses new recipes and even tells me goodnight." Opaca looked at Kathryn. "I
think he would be very hurt if I suddenly reappeared and didn’t want to be with
him."</P>
<P>"What do you want?" Kathryn asked. She covered Opaca’s hand with her own.</P>
<P>"I missed you all. I didn’t like floating around the cosmos. It was so
scattered. Being in this matrix has allowed me to be grounded and it feels
wonderful." Opaca sighed and squeezed Kathryn’s arm.</P>
<P>"But what do you want?" Kathryn asked again, her voice a low whisper.</P>
<P>"I want to be home," Opaca whispered. She tilted her head forward and
holographic tears slid down her cheeks.</P>
<P>"Kes," Kathryn whispered. "Opaca, you are welcome here as long as you want to
stay, and I will do everything I can to help keep your secret. Although, I think
Neelix would be thrilled to have you back in any form. I know I am."</P>
<P>Opaca nodded, but didn’t look up. Kathryn cupped her chin and lifted her
face.</P>
<P>"I am so glad you are back," Kathryn said. She looked into Opaca’s deep brown
eyes and studied the grin that made her heart ache. She had missed Kes’ smile.
Before she realized what she was doing Kathryn leaned forward and brushed her
lips across Opaca’s. She was warm and welcoming and nothing like the Sullivan
hologram. Opaca felt real and Kathryn could feel the emotion welling up in her
partner. Opaca whimpered and moved closer to Kathryn. She wrapped her arms
around Kathryn’s waist but was shocked to feel the older woman pull away.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry," Kathryn said as she touched her lips. She could still feel the
warmth of Opaca’s kiss. "I shouldn’t have done that."</P>
<P>"Why?" Opaca asked. "I’ve been waiting for that kiss for almost seven
years."</P>
<P>Kathryn raised both eyebrows high onto her forehead and then chuckled
nervously. "I certainly didn’t expect to be kissing another hologram."</P>
<P>"How about if we…play it by ear?" Opaca asked as she tilted her head down and
looked up coyly at Kathryn through her lashes.</P>
<P>Kathryn smiled, this time warmly. "Speaking of ears…I really miss yours."</P>
<P>Opaca tugged at her ear, smiling. "I like them. I can wear earrings now.
Before…they didn’t look right on me, and I think the ridges are quite
becoming."</P>
<P>"They are," Kathryn agreed. "In any form, I am so glad you are here."</P>
<P>"So am I," Opaca said. She held out her arms and Kathryn welcomed the
embrace. Both women held on tight, enjoying the warmth. They stayed that way for
several minutes, neither knowing where their lives would take them, but both
knowing that their futures had just gotten a great deal brighter.</P>
<P>When they broke apart, Kathryn got herself of cup of coffee and then sat next
to Opaca on the couch. </P>
<P>"Now, tell me everything you saw," Kathryn said as she settled into the
welcoming cushions. "What wonders of the universe did you see?"</P>
<P>"This could take a while." Opaca leaned back against the arm of the couch.
She looked at her shoes, then flickered briefly and her feet morphed and the
shoes were gone. She stretched her sock-covered toes and sighed. "Might as well
get comfortable."</P>
<P>"By all means," Kathryn said. She held her cup in one hand and used the other
to guide the hologram’s feet onto her lap. "Now, tell me everything."</P>
<P>"Well, I got to see a forming gas giant hit by an interstellar string. It was
beautiful," Opaca said. She enjoyed the feeling of Kathryn’s hand resting on her
feet.</P>
<P>"Fascinating," Kathryn said as she prepared for a very long night. "Can you
describe it?"</P>
<P>Opaca nodded and began sharing all of the adventures she had witnessed on her
travels around the universe.</P>

<P>Epilogue:</P>
<P>It was dark, but Kayla was warm and happy. It had taken her days to train her
two mamas that she didn’t want to sleep alone in the tiny, lonely bed in the
other room. Kayla opened her eyes, and squeaked. She was in the mama-bed. It was
warm, with the milk-mama on one side quietly snoring, and the singing-mama on
the other side. The milk-mama was warm, almost hot, and she smelled of love,
while the singing-mama was soft and sweet and her chest vibrated when she sang
or hummed. Kayla loved being in the mama-bed with the two halves of her universe
on either side. She would wake up, but she wouldn’t cry. There wasn’t any reason
to be upset at all. Both her mamas were next to her and the singing-mama seemed
to sense when Kayla would wake. The singing-mama would rest her hand on Kayla’s
belly, rubbing softly to soothe her loneliness in the night. Sometimes the
singing-mama would move one finger up near Kayla’s face so she could suck on it.
It didn’t yield milk like the other mama’s breast, but it was soothing and she
would drift off to sleep.</P>
<P>Kayla’s eyes were bright and darted around the room as the light of the
morning shift began coming up. Her mamas slept snuggled up close to her, each
one carefully draping their arm over her so that they could touch each other.
Kayla felt warm and safe and most of all she felt loved. She wiggled her tiny
toes and squeaked as she felt the milk-mama lean over toward her.</P>
<P>"Shh, little one," B’Elanna whispered as she kissed her daughter’s tiny
ridges. "You stay quiet and don’t wake your mama." She moved away, leaving the
cooling sheets in her place. </P>
<P>Kayla did not like it when one of her mamas was gone. It felt like part of
her world was missing, and the mamas didn’t seem quite as happy when one of them
was away. She kicked her feet in protest, not liking the way the bed seemed only
half full.</P>
<P>Seven sighed and she moved her hand onto Kayla’s belly. She rubbed slow,
small circles and Kayla stopped kicking and grabbed her mama’s fingers. Seven
reacted instantly, letting Kayla tug her finger higher until she began sucking
on Seven’s pinky. That definitely comforted her and she sucked harder, her tiny
lips smacking.</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes and yawned. She smiled, looking over at Kayla. "Good
morning," she whispered, and then looked over at the empty side of the bed.
"Where is your So’Soy? Hmm?" Seven shifted her weight and she reached under
Kayla to make sure that she was still dry. Seven had designed a moisture
detector for her diapers, but the former drone liked to be thorough.</P>
<P>"Good morning, love," B’Elanna said from behind Seven.</P>
<P>The former Borg twisted her head so that she could see her wife. B’Elanna
held out a steaming mug.</P>
<P>"Is that what I think it is?" Seven asked. Her eyes widened as she took the
cup with one hand, twisting so she didn’t have to disturb Kayla. She inhaled the
steam, moaning when the faint scent of raspberry hit her nostrils. "I love you,"
Seven said, then began gulping her beverage.</P>
<P>B’Elanna moved around the bed and crawled back under the covers. She scooped
up Kayla and cradled her in the crook of her elbow. "Your mama is a sucker for
raspberry tea. If you ever <I>fix</I> anything you aren’t supposed to, just
bring her some tea."</P>
<P>"And what did you do that warranted bringing me tea?" Seven asked. She smiled
as she watched B’Elanna rubbing noses with Kayla.</P>
<P>"Me?" B’Elanna asked. "Nothing. This is just me getting back into the swing.
Now that you’re not pregnant anymore…you can have all the tea you want. No
caffeine restrictions, love." Kayla nuzzled B’Elanna’s chest. "Hmm, looks like
someone else is thirsty." B’Elanna balanced Kayla as she opened her nightgown
and quickly helped her daughter begin breakfast.</P>
<P>Seven gulped down the last of her tea, then looked into the empty cup, her
expression crestfallen.</P>
<P>"Oh, love," B’Elanna said with a smirk. "You always do that."</P>
<P>"Do what?" Seven asked without looking up from her depressingly empty
mug.</P>
<P>"That…You always get so excited about your tea," B’Elanna said. "You just
gulp it down and then you sit there and stare into the cup… pouting." B’Elanna
cringed. "I think your daughter is getting her infant incisors." She had hoped
that Kayla would not have the extra set of teeth that all Klingon infants got.
It was another set of baby teeth that came in during the first month. They were
small, but extremely sharp.</P>
<P>"I do not pout," Seven said. She tilted the cup and sighed.</P>
<P>"Uh huh." B’Elanna turned toward the nightstand and then spun back around
holding out a small stasis teapot.</P>
<P>"I love you, my Be’nal," Seven said as her eyes sparkled. She took the pot
and filled her cup, setting the extra tea on her own nightstand. "You seem to be
getting the hang of that," Seven added when she turned back toward her wife.
B’Elanna was managing to balance Kayla in place with one arm while she
straightened the blanket.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well, Kayla has more suction than a blown out airlock. I don’t think I
could pry her loose with a hyper spanner."</P>
<P>"I cannot blame her. Your breasts are most…desirable." Seven sighed happily
as she sipped her tea.</P>
<P>B’Elanna leaned against Seven and rested her head on her wife’s shoulder. "I
love you, Seven," she whispered.</P>
<P>"And I love you, my beloved Be’nal," Seven said as she tilted her head and
kissed B’Elanna’s temple. She looked at Kayla and smiled, then leaned down
carefully and kissed the side of her face. Kayla smacked her lips, unwilling to
unlatch. "Kayla, my greatest wish is that you will someday find a love like
ours," she whispered.</P>
<P>"She will, my love," B’Elanna said. "Okay, little one, time to swap sides."
She shifted Kayla, trying to move her to the other breast, but Kayla clamped
down, unwilling to move just yet. "She doesn’t even listen to us," B’Elanna said
with a chuckle. "We are in so much trouble."</P>
<P>"She will listen. She is our daughter, and daughters listen to their mothers
and do what they are told." Seven put her cup down and wrapped her arm around
B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven? Darling? How often do you or I do as we are told?" B’Elanna asked
sweetly. </P>
<P>There was a long paused as Seven processed that fact.</P>
<P>"Trouble is not an adequate word to describe what we are going to
experience," Seven said grimly.</P>
<P>"Nope," B’Elanna snuggled into Seven’s embrace, letting Kayla stay where she
was, firmly attached to her breast and not about to let go. Her tiny fists
grabbed onto the silky fabric of B’Elanna’s nightgown making certain that her
milk-mama didn’t escape. "We are so screwed," B’Elanna said, though she didn’t
seem upset by the idea.</P>
<P>"Well, we could be," Seven said as she smoothed Kayla’s auburn curls. "But
not in front of our daughter."</P>
<P>B’Elanna rolled her eyes.</P>
