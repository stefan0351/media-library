<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Eighteen -->

<p>Brooke sat watching Sam in Psych class, her body just itching to feel the brunette's against her. She could barely sit still she was so keyed up. And Sam was so calm it was annoying her. It was like Sam was on another plane of existence and the previous day's events hadn't happened. Meanwhile Brooke couldn't concentrate on anything other than replaying every memorable moment over and over in her mind. She envied Sam for her calm, and hated her for it too.</p>
<p>So she jumped slightly when she felt the feather light scratch of nails on her knee. She looked down to see Sam's hand caressing her thigh and smiled. She looked back up to see a telltale smirk on Sam's face as the journalist pretended to pay attention to class.</p>
<p>"Our next chapter is somewhat appropriate," Mr. Peterson, the psych teacher announced. "We'll be covering traumatic brain injuries, both those caused by medical conditions such as strokes, and those caused by injuries. Perhaps Ms McQueen and Ms McPherson will be willing to give us some first hand accounts on their experience with amnesia."</p>
<p>Sam's hand froze in its gentle exploration of Brooke's skin and she swallowed as the classes attention was suddenly directed at her.</p>
<p>"Uhm..." she stumbled helplessly. Brooke looked at the teacher with an expression of utter contempt and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"And then again, perhaps not," she retorted angrily. "Personal much?" Sam could feel the blonde bristling under the scrutiny.</p>
<p>"Uh...what she means is that we'd rather not. It's a painful and personal subject," she bluffed, giving Brooke's leg a reassuring squeeze. Peterson shrugged.</p>
<p>"Very well," he sighed. "Let me know if either of you change your mind. I'm sure it'd be very interesting to hear first person perspectives on the subject."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Brooke snapped. Peterson went back to teaching the class while Brooke silently fumed.</p>
<p>"Easy, Brooke. He didn't mean any harm," Sam whispered. Brooke shot her a dirty look but then softened. It wasn't Sam's fault, after all.</p>
<p>"I know," she sighed. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"It's OK," Sam assured her as her hand started its petting motions again. She finally turned to look at Brooke. The expression of pure love and adoration in those rich chocolate eyes immediately put Brooke at ease. She put her hand over Sam's and laced their fingers together.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy," she whispered. Sam smiled and turned back to the class, never releasing her hold on Brooke's hand.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Sam, can we talk to you?" Lily asked as Sam laced up her sneakers for gym class. Sam sighed. She really didn't feel like talking to Lily and Carmen right now. It was the last class of the day and all she was really interested in was going home and seeing what Brooke was in the mood to do.</p>
<p>(Sex, movies, sex, dinner, sex, board games, sex, cards, sex...gee Sam, horny much?) she joked to herself. But truth to be told, she wasn't just interested in making love to the gorgeous blonde. While there was no denying that that aspect of the relationship was great, Sam was also into just holding Brooke close, feeling her warmth and breathing her scent. It was when Sam felt the safest.</p>
<p>"I guess," Sam sighed out loud. Carmen fidgeted while Lily gathered her thoughts.</p>
<p>"What you did last summer was really mean," Lily blurted out. "You really hurt us both. You never said good-bye, you just left. And then you didn't stay in contact. I thought we were friends."</p>
<p>"We were," Sam agreed.</p>
<p>"That's not how friends treat each other," Carmen pointed out. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"I know. Look, what do you want me to say? I'm sorry? Well, I am. I admit it was wrong of me and I apologize, but I had my reasons," Sam explained. Lily frowned.</p>
<p>"What reasons, Sam? We're your friends, we would have listened," she told her. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"Doesn't matter now. What's done is done. I can't take it back or change it. The best I can do is apologize and I did that. What more do you want?" Sam asked tiredly.</p>
<p>"How about an explanation?" Carmen demanded angrily. Sam stood up and glared.</p>
<p>"Car, did you ever THINK that maybe I was hurting and needed time to sort things out on my own? Or were you too caught up in your 'oh woe is me, she didn't say good-bye' crap to realize that? I was in pain, OK? So I left. Deal," she snapped back. Carmen gaped at her, shocked by the outburst while Lily just sighed.</p>
<p>"You could have come to us with what was wrong, Sam," she said softly.</p>
<p>"No, I couldn't. You wouldn't have understood," Sam answered sadly.</p>
<p>"What's to understand, Sam? You lost Harrison to Brooke. You came in second best to her yet again," Carmen taunted. Sam's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"It must be nice in that little black and white world of yours, Carmen. Let me know when you rejoin reality," Sam said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Guys, stop it!" Lily broke in. "Sam, why are you so mad at us? We didn't do anything wrong," she said a little wounded. She missed having Sam around as a friend and just wanted to patch things up. But it wasn't working out like she wanted.</p>
<p>"Look," Sam said a bit calmer. "I'm not mad at you but I can't change what I did. Vilifying me for it now won't do anyone any good. I really am sorry I acted like such an ass last summer. But don't assume to understand why I acted the way I did because you can't begin to comprehend it. It wasn't just Brooke and Harrison; it was a few other things too. But it's done with now so..." she trailed off as the three of them walked out onto the field. Harrison walked by them and rudely jostled Sam in the side.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Lily yelled as she steadied an off-balance Sam. Harrison glared at them.</p>
<p>"Oh sorry, my bad," he sneered as he jogged away.</p>
<p>"Prick!" Sam shot back.</p>
<p>"He really didn't take the break up well, did he?" Carmen asked, turning to Sam. "He seems to blame you, like it's all your fault." Sam snorted.</p>
<p>"Why not? Everything else always is," she retorted.</p>
<p>"Saaaam," Lily complained. Sam shook her head to stop her.</p>
<p>"Never mind, Lily. So, like I was saying. I really am sorry for what I did. Is there anyway you guys can just forgive me and we can move on? Because I miss having you around," Sam confessed. Lily and Carmen exchanged looks.</p>
<p>"Well, since we're obviously not going to get an explanation, an apology will have to do. Right Carm?" Carmen nodded. "We've missed you too, Sam."</p>
<p>"And Brooke," Carmen piped up. "Speaking of whom, where is she?" The three of them scanned the field looking for the wayward blonde, finally finding her cornered by Nicole and Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Oh no, she's been trapped by Satan and Tweedle Dumb," Sam sighed. "We'd better go help her."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"So, Brookie, have any epiphanies lately?" Nicole asked sarcastically as Brooke just rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Awfully big word, Nicole. Are you sure you didn't hurt yourself?" she mocked. Nicole huffed at her.</p>
<p>"Have I mentioned lately how much I really don't like the 'new' you?" Nic bit out. Brooke shrugged and smiled.</p>
<p>"And have I mentioned how much I really don't care?" she shot back.</p>
<p>"Jus' drop th' act, Lil' Missy," Mary Cherry ordered. "We know yer jus' fakin' th' whole amnesia trip."</p>
<p>"Oh get a grip, Cowpoke," Brooke snapped back. "I'm not faking and even if I were, I'd make SURE not to remember the two of you."</p>
<p>"You know what I don't get?" Nicole sneered. "Why is it this 'new' brain damaged you hates everyone but Spam McFearsome? You two barely got along before you scrambled the three brain cells you DID have and now you're like, bosom buddies. Explain that to me," she demanded.</p>
<p>"My rapier wit and devastating charm?" Sam asked from behind her. Brooke smiled broadly at seeing her.</p>
<p>"Or perhaps my stunning good looks?" Sam added cheekily. "At any rate, take a hike, Satan. Your permit for habitation has expired."</p>
<p>"Oh looky, here's Spam now. Bite me," Nicole growled. Over the short blonde's head, Sam arched an eyebrow at Brooke and licked her lips, watching as a deep red flush spread across the taller blonde's face.</p>
<p>"No thanks, not my flavor," Sam retorted, her eyes still locked with Brooke's.</p>
<p>"Ew, as if, McPherson," Nicole shuddered.</p>
<p>"Nicole, don't you and Mary Cherry have some baby seals to go club to death?" Lily taunted distastefully.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Mary Cherry shouted. "Ah do not wear baby seal. Ah insist on anally electrocuted mink. It's humane."</p>
<p>"OK. Let me stick a pole up your ass and connect it to a car battery and THEN you tell me it's humane," Lily challenged as Carmen giggled. Sam and Brooke ignored all this as they stared wantonly at each other.</p>
<p>"LADIES!" the gym teacher shouted. "You plan on joining us TODAY?"</p>
