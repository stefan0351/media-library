<p>The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 7 by patricia51</p>
<p>(You didn't miss anything. This picks up a week or so after Chapter 6 and those events between this scene and the previous one will be covered.)</p>
<p>Juliet slipped up behind her girl, her arms going around the slender body. Her hands touched the firm tummy, rubbing there in gentle circles. She blew in the dark haired girl's ear and smiled at the shivers her ministrations were producing.</p>
<p>"You like that Alex?" she whispered. Her tongue darted in that same ear while her hands separated. One slipped up to cup a small delicious breast and stroke the already hard nipple. The other slid down further between the teen wizardess' legs and began to stroke the secret nubbin there.</p>
<p>"Oh GOD, Juliet," moaned Alex as she rubbed her taut bottom against the girl vampire's wetness. "Don't stop. I love you."</p>
<p>"I love you too," gasped Juliet. Her hips circled against Alex, her fingers moved faster. She let her lips dance down the smooth neck and settle on the shoulder. She felt her lover trembling, her body building, as was Juliet's own.</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhh," Alex bucked against her. Juliet's fingers went crazy and both girls followed. As they arched in their release Juliet's fangs found the hammering spot in Alex's neck. Lost in her orgasm the budding wizardess hardly felt the bite. Before she could come down from her explosion her vision was already turning gray.</p>
<p>Juliet reveled in the sweet tang of her girlfriend's blood. She sucked greedily. Under her hand she felt Alex's heart race with the realization of what was happening. There was a token struggle by the mortal girl before she sagged against the female vampire. Her body spasmed one more time and then was still.</p>
<p>Juliet carefully stretched Alex's body out on the nearby bed. The head rolled sideways, the lifeless eyes looking at her. A look of pleasure mingled with surprise was left on the other girl's face.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Alex," whispered Juliet as she kissed the already cooling lips. "But after all, I'm a vampire. It's what we do."</p>
<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" screamed Juliet as her eyes opened.</p>
<p>"Juliet! Juliet! Wake up!"</p>
<p>The teenaged vampire sat up in her bed as best she could with Alex's arms wrapped around her. Voices sounded from the hallway outside the door. Theresa Russo, wrapped up in a house coat, slipped in and rushed to where her daughter was rocking the other girl.</p>
<p>"It was just a nightmare," Alex kept reassuring a sobbing Juliet. Her mom dropped to one knee and helped sooth the nearly hysterical teen who kept rocking and moaning.</p>
<p>"No, no, no," gasped Juliet over and over.</p>
<p>"No what sweetheart?" Alex asked.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I just can't."</p>
<p>Finally Juliet calmed down enough to lay back down. She curled up in a ball, clutching her pillow to her tummy. Alex and her Mother stepped out of the room.</p>
<p>"We have to find out what is wrong Alex. This is the third night in a row Juliet has woke up from horrible dream. Not only is everyone else in the house being disturbed but it's doing terrible things to her. She's haggard and afraid to go to bed at night. I'm really worried about her."</p>
<p>In spite of the gravity of the situation Alex felt warm knowing how much her Mother worried about her girlfriend. All the Russos had taken Juliet to heart and made her a part of the family.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," fretted Alex. "Things have been going so well. And Juliet's spirits were lifted so much from her parents' visit last week. What in the world has happened?"</p>
<p>(Previous week)</p>
<p>"Mother. Father."</p>
<p>"Juliet." Her Father scanned the room. "Please pardon this intrusion. But my wife has something to say to our daughter."</p>
<p>Sometimes Juliet forgot what a powerful figure her Dad could be. Normally he seemed all posturing and bluster, with his ringing declarations of "unleashing his wrath" on this person or that thing. It had generally seemed like her Mom was the one in control. But now her Father seemed taller and certainly commanding.</p>
<p>"Cindy?"</p>
<p>"Juliet, I'm sorry." Her mother groped for words. "It's not an excuse and certainly not a good reason but I was surprised, and I confess it, shocked at your declaration of affection for a mortal and another girl at that. In some ways your Father and I, especially me, are very conservative but please remember the culture we were raised in a long ago was that way. Even after thousand of years it's hard to shake off one's upbringing."</p>
<p>"We'd like you to come home," Alucard, "But," he raised a hand as Juliet shook her head. "We understand that right now you probably are feeling unsure." He looked around the Russo kitchen again. "I see you look settled. And happy. That's all your mother and I have ever wished for you."</p>
<p>Cindy nodded. "I hope you will accept this from us." She produced a keg that was a smaller duplicate of the one that the vampire family kept their blood in. "I assume you are still volunteering at the blood bank but this is your favorite AB Positive. Keep it for those nights and mornings when you really need a touch of home." With that the two older vampires left.</p>
<p>'Well," Theresa Russo fumbled for words. After al, a keg of blood IS a rather unusual peace offering. "I'm glad your parents seem to be coming around Juliet." She quickly added, "But this doesn't mean that we don't want you to stay. We do."</p>
<p>"I understand Mrs. Russo," Juliet smiled. "And thank you. Thank all of you."</p>
<p>With the acceptance by her parents Juliet had blossomed. The cloud that had hung over the young woman had vanished. Now she was unabashedly a woman in love with no thoughts to spoil the knowledge that the girl she loved wholeheartedly returned the feeling. Warm feelings from Alex and from Alex's family lapped her all around.</p>
<p>So what was wrong? What had happened? She had heard Alex and her mom discussing the problem. And it was worse than they knew. Two nights before the first nightmare that everyone was aware of she had woken up from something she hadn't been able to recall but that had filled her with dread and fear. The next night had still been something of a formless terror but she had known one thing on awakening. She still couldn't recall the dream itself but she had known two things. It had involved Alex and what had happened had not been good.</p>
<p>Concern from all the Russos had helped Juliet get hold of herself. A cup of tea and a nibble on one of Mrs. Russo's hot biscuits had helped too. She discreetly sipped a glass of blood; a mingled blend of what she had got from the blood bank with what her parents had brought. She felt better. The day passed fairly quickly as she helped out at the Sub Station while Alex and her brothers were at school. Then they were all home and she got a chance to cuddle a little with Alex before supper.</p>
<p>During and after supper though an increasing uneasiness grew on her. It had to do with Alex. Time and again Juliet found her attention fixed on her lover's neck. She could see the throbbing vein just under the smooth elegant neck. She could hear Alex's heart beating and it was like a siren's call to her. Twice she found herself leaning towards Alex, drawn to that one point. She could feel her fangs dropping and made an effort to pull them back, nearly as strong an effort as she made to appear that everything was alright.</p>
<p>When night feel and the family went to bed Juliet could no longer deny that something was terribly wrong. When she kissed Alex good night and the two girls hugged she found she came within a inch of losing control. She could smell Alex's blood and the scent nearly drove her crazy. Her mouth watered at the idea of the other teen's blood pouring down her throat.</p>
<p>"Oh GOD what was wrong?" She moaned to herself. Regardless of the cause, she knew the solution. She laid awake listening until the soft regular breathing from Alex's bed convinced her that her girlfriend was asleep. Then as quietly as she could, she gathered a few of her things and slipped from the room.</p>
<p>When she reached the kitchen she hesitated. Could she just leave without a word? Perhaps it would be for the best if she did. But when she thought of not only the love she had been give from Alex but the welcome she had got from the whole family she decided she couldn't do that. Finding a piece of paper and an pencil she began to write.</p>
<p>In the morning Alex came down the stairs with a puzzled look on her face. She spotted her mother sitting at the kitchen table with a piece of paper in her hands.</p>
<p>"Mom? Where's Juliet?"</p>
<p>Theresa rose to her feet and wrapped her daughter in her arms, knowing she would need a lot of support in the next few moments.</p>
<p>"She's gone."</p>
