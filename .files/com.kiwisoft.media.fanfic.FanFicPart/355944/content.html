<!-- What Ever Happened To \ Part Two -->

<p>The tall brunette stumbled into the lobby of the hotel. It was quaint to say the least and the perfect addition to downtown Hawthorne, the small New England town where she had grown up. As she drove around, she realized that much had changed during her absence. There were still no convenience stores or a McDonalds within a twenty mile radius. People didn't work here unless you owned the local diner or hardware store. They commuted by car or train into the next city. It was a good place to settle down if you lacked a pulse.</p>
		<p>So why did she bother coming back? A part of her still missed the quiet little community where you knew your neighbors. She missed her parents and regretted that she didn't visit more often. But then again, her mother and stepfather were always traveling. She was happy that they actually were enjoying their retirement.</p>
		<p>Now the town was tearing down the old high school and, as a fundraiser, throwing a reunion for all of the alumni. The money would be used for programs and equipment at the new high school. There were even a few surviving members from the class of 1917 that would be in attendance. Whitney sighed, thinking that she would probably be hanging out with her parents during most of the festivities.</p>
		<p>She had been a shy awkward teenager and never made any really close friends except for Kenny. And he had been gone for almost ten years now. She made a note that she should visit his parents. He wasn't the first friend she lost to AIDS, but he had been the closest to her heart. She smiled at the memory of him. Two gay kids locked in a small town. Everyone thought they were a couple. They did look great together at the prom.</p>
		<p>"Reservation for Ward, " she offered to the desk clerk who punched her name into the computer.</p>
		<p>"Yes, we have you in Room 103, " the young man confirmed as he smiled brightly at her. "Queen size bed, non-smoking. I just need a credit card. "</p>
		<p>She slid over her Visa and waited for everything to be processed. "The bellhop will take your luggage and show you up to your room. Enjoy your reunion, " the young man continued brightly as she placed her credit card back into her wallet. "And if you need anything . . . , " he added.</p>
		<p>"I'll let you know, " she responded dryly, not missing his lame attempt at flirting with her.</p>
		<p>Once she was in her room, she called her parents. After agreeing to meet them for dinner, Whitney checked her watch, noting that she had just enough time to catch a nap. Then she could take a nice relaxing shower and go see her folks. What could be better than a nice visit and a home-cooked meal?</p>
		<p>Whitney smiled as she stretched out on the bed. "Not a very exciting evening. " She smiled brighter. To the tired lawyer, the thought of a couple of days with nothing to do but relax and enjoy some time with her family sounded like heaven. Of course, she could always look up that little blonde from chemistry class.</p>
		<p>Whitney's blue eyes fluttered shut. She couldn't believe that she had asked Selma about her. She tried to seem casual about her inquiry, but it must have been obvious. She and Holly hadn't hung around together. A crowd of people had forever surrounded the energetic little blonde. If Selma suspected Whitney's true motives, she didn't let on.</p>
		<p>Selma was good that way. Whitney was surprised that the outgoing Hispanic girl was still living in Hawthorne and teaching at the local high school. "She must be great at keeping those kids in line." Whitney chuckled. Selma was thrilled when Whitney told her who she was. <i>'She even remembered me. I didn't think anyone would know who I am. ' </i>She'd been more than willing to fill her in on what was happening with Holly.</p>
		<p>That had surprised Whitney. Selma was always the one person who had the dirt on everything, yet she wasn't a gossip. Whitney found it strange that she would just blurt out what Holly had been up to. She knew she was probably just imagining things, but she could have sworn that Selma was . . . <i>'Nah, don't be silly. Holly is probably married with a ton of kids. '</i></p>
		<p>Well, not married. Selma did mention that. But she didn't say she was gay. Whitney had blushed during the entire conversation with Selma. She didn't know what made her ask about Holly. Being sentimental was one thing, but checking up on the girl you first fantasized about when you touched yourself was just odd.</p>
		<p>Though those were some really hot fantasies. Whitney smirked as she drifted off to sleep. After her nap, she finished dressing and blow-drying her hair. As the last of the dampness dissipated from her long raven tresses, she cursed herself for not just cutting it off. "One of these days," she groused.</p>
		<p>Whitney double-checked her coat pockets to insure that she had her wallet and card key to her room before shutting the door. Just as she started down the hallway, the elevator opened up. "Perfect. " She smiled at her good fortune. Her smile vanished as her mouth hung open. Stepping off the elevator was the most adorable blonde. She quickly snapped her mouth shut and donned a cool expression, hoping to hide her ogling.</p>
		<p>She smiled brightly at the smaller woman as she stepped into the elevator. Their bodies brushed slightly as they passed each other. Whitney trembled from the contact. Her blue eyes fluttered shut for an instant as the sweet scent of jasmine and vanilla invaded her senses. She opened her eyes to watch as the blonde's well-defined backside made it's way down the hallway. "Perfect, " she repeated as she watched her carefully.</p>
		<p>Whitney's brow suddenly furrowed as she noticed something decidedly familiar to the woman's gait. Her eyes widened as the elevator doors began to close, eclipsing her view. "Holly?" she stammered in surprise. She could see the blonde turning towards the elevator just as the doors closed. Whitney blushed furiously as she realized what had just happened. "Oh great. " Whitney slapped her forehead. "I didn't recognize her face, but her ass I know. " Whitney started to bang her head lightly on the wall of the elevator as it made its descent. "Way to go, Whitney," she berated herself.</p>
