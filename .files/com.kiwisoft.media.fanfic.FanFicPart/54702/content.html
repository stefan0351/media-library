<!-- New Frontier \ Part 2 -->

<p>The lights in the captain's quarters rose to day level at 0600, alerting B'Elanna to the beginning of the day shift. She groaned and rubbed the caked tears out of her eyes and dried snot from underneath her nose. A moment later, the lights in the living area were out again, leaving B'Elanna a little confused.</p>

		<p>"Captain?" she called out.</p>

		<p>"Go back to sleep, B'Elanna. You have the day off," Janeway said as she stood in her robe at the door of her bedroom. "I'll try to be quiet."</p>

		<p>"There's no need, Captain. I should be leaving. I've used up too much of your time."</p>

		<p>"It's no problem, B'Elanna, and if I have to order you to take the day off, I will, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"I wasn't complaining about that, I just don't want to cry on your couch for the rest of my life. This isn't me."</p>

		<p>"You've got emotions, everybody does..."</p>

		<p>"Except for Tuvok."</p>

		<p>"Oh, he has them, he just suppresses them. At any rate, you're allowed and I won't tell anybody about what happened. That's between you and me. If you are so insistent about leaving, wait until I have my shower and change and then you can take a bath, recycle your uniform and then go. You'll feel a million times better."</p>

		<p>"A bath?"</p>

		<p>"Yep. I have a tub, Captain's privilege. Oils and salts are in the compartment above. Just pick up the wet towels when you're done. I know how you are, B'Elanna. You can't deny that much. I know you too well."</p>

		<p>"Thanks," she said sheepishly. It was nice to be treated so well, mothered in fact. Janeway left her alone and went about her daily ministrations. She promptly fell asleep and didn't wake up until her hostess had left, the swishing of the door being her wake up call.</p>

		<p>"Kahless," she moaned as she stretched out on the couch. She uncoiled from the couch, carefully folded the sheets and blanket, smelling them one final time, and set them carefully on the couch. >What does she do to these sheets? They smell so much better than mine. Familiar, in fact.=</p>

		<p>She shrugged to herself, as she would in those private moments, went back to the ensuite and prepared herself a bath. She stripped her clothes, throwing them haphazardly around the bathroom. She climbed into the tub and sighed at the contact in the gloriously warm and beautifully scented water. She could almost forget what had happened the night before.</p>

		<p>Almost, that is.</p>

		<p>Sadness rushed over her once again and she began sobbing those wracking tears that had washed over her the night before. It wasn't about Tom or the fact that he had cheated on her. It was about the fact that she was made a fool and that she was alone once more.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Seven entered the captain's quarters upon her request to make sure that B'Elanna ate something that morning. She didn't plan on sticking around too long since she would more than likely be yelled at by the combative engineer. Her plans changed when she heard the sound of crying coming from the bathroom.</p>

		<p>She walked quietly into the next room and peeked around the door jam of the bathroom. There she saw the object of her affection, B'Elanna Torres, barely covered by bubbles in a warm tub. However, none of that was important. B'Elanna was crying and harder than she had the night before.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," Seven whispered, her voice taking on a softness that it hadn't had before. The engineer didn't hear her and continued to sob, hugging her knees.</p>

		<p>Seven stepped into the bathroom, knelt beside the tub and gently wrapped her arms around B'Elanna. "It is alright, Lanna. I am here. Do not worry," she cooed softly.</p>

		<p>"Why did he do it?"</p>

		<p>"I do not know," Seven replied. She stroked B'Elanna's hair and kissed the top of her ridges. </p>

		<p>B'Elanna wrapped her arms around Seven's torso, putting all of her effort into the embrace.</p>

		<p>"I was such a fool. Such a fool."</p>

		<p>"You were not the fool, Lanna. Tom was for treating you so awfully."</p>

		<p>"What? Huh?" B'Elanna said as she backed away quickly. It was as if she wasn't expecting a response. She covered her chest with her crossed arms and looked at Seven with horror in her eyes. "Seven, what are you doing here?"</p>

		<p>"The captain asked me to check in on you and make sure that you ate a good breakfast." Seven said, looking her directly in the eyes. "If you are worried that I will not keep this confidential, you should not. I will tell no one. Also, the only parts of your anatomy that I saw unclothed were your back and your knees."</p>

		<p>"Can you leave me alone for a few moments?" B'Elanna asked.</p>

		<p>"If you insist. I am willing, however, to wash your hair if you would like me to do so. I know that I enjoy it when the Captain washes my hair."</p>

		<p>"Janeway washes your hair?"</p>

		<p>"On occasion. It is not sexual, Lieutenant. She has been showing me different ways that I could do my hair. We are friends."</p>

		<p>"At any rate, I think I can do that myself, Seven. Thanks."</p>

		<p>"It would be no trouble," Seven replied. She wasn't going to take no for an answer. "I have the day off."</p>

		<p>"If you insist, but give me one of those wash clothes."</p>

		<p>Seven handed over a wash cloth and B'Elanna placed it across her chest before she settled back into the water.</p>

		<p>"It surprises me that you are so shy about your body," Seven said as she reached for the showerhead. Without waiting for a response, she doused B'Elanna's hair with warm water.</p>

		<p>"Why do you say that?" her charge replied, spitting up water in the process.</p>

		<p>"You covered yourself."</p>

		<p>"Well, usually people only share that part of themselves when they have become..."</p>

		<p>"Lovers?" Seven asked as she massaged the shampoo into B'Elanna's hair and scalp. Her touch was firm, yet gentle. B'Elanna didn't feel the scraping of metal on her skull like she thought she would have. This was becoming a very pleasurable experience for B'Elanna, as well as Seven.</p>

		<p>"That's one way to put it. And I do not know you all that well."</p>

		<p>"I have been aboard for three years."</p>

		<p>"I know."</p>

		<p>"Do you wish to know me better?"</p>

		<p>"Maybe. I mean, we aren't the best of friends. We fight like cats and dogs most times."</p>

		<p>"Our relationship has become less adversarial as of late. I do appreciate your kind words when I thought I was dying."</p>

		<p>"I was concerned."</p>

		<p>Seven smiled behind B'Elanna's back at the thought. >She cares for me,' she thought.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Mr. Paris to my ready room," Janeway said as she tapped her comm badge and settled in her chair behind the desk. She hated doing this part of her job -- dealing with her crew's personal problems. True, she liked the fact that the closeness of some of the crew allowed them to come to her and cry on her shoulder if they needed to like B'Elanna did the night before. She did like being able to share the good times better, of course, but these few sad times showed her that she really meant something beyond the one who gave orders. If they were in the Alpha Quadrant rather than so far from home, they probably would not be that close.</p>

		<p>Kathryn became Captain Janeway, putting her mask firmly over her personable face. She became very stern and unemotional as her strongest mask dictated. Still, she exuded some warmth. That much couldn't be hidden by her mask, but it was tempered, so that the one in front of her knew that the warmth wasn't necessarily for them.</p>

		<p>"You wished to see me, Captain?" Tom said as the doors swished open and he stepped inside. His stance was a little too casual, but that was the nature of his attention stance. He refused to look away from his commanding officers like Starfleet officers had been taught in their basic training, he was much too good for that. Or at least he thought. He held his hands in front of him. He leaned on one leg rather than the other, didn't matter which leg because it kept changing. His shoulders were not slumped but they were not straight as they should have been.</p>

		<p>"Sit," Janeway snapped. >His eyes are swollen.' Her eyebrow raised. "Lt. Torres came to see me last night." Tom tried to speak but she stopped him. "She wants a divorce, and from what she's told me, I don't blame her. Tell me your side of the story."</p>

		<p>"We have an open relationship."</p>

		<p>>That's what Cheb Parker told me when I caught him cheating.=</p>

		<p>"Not according to B'Elanna. Was that memo lost?"</p>

		<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

		<p>"Didn't think so. Now, you can do two things. You can grant the divorce, thus showing good faith and maybe she'll take you back as a friend in the future. Or you can contest the divorce, make her even more angry than she is already, drag it out for a few weeks, until I decide that is enough and annul it without any input from you. At that point, I don't think B'Elanna would ever stand to be in your presence again which would make things incredible difficult for the rest of us. What is your choice?"</p>

		<p>"You're on her side."</p>

		<p>"When I decided to have you on my ship, Tom, I did so against the wishes of your father, but he made me promise that I wouldn't let you do anything unbecoming an officer. I accepted the responsibility of trying to be your conscious, knowing that it would be impossible, but I would be here as a sounding board. Tom, you were very stupid with this whole mess. If you were going to drop her after two weeks of marriage in favor of someone else, why did you get married at all?"</p>

		<p>"I love her, Captain. I will never stop loving her."</p>

		<p>"That doesn't answer my question."</p>

		<p>"I thought we could do it. I thought it would make us closer. She was drifting away before that. I thought I was going to lose her."</p>

		<p>"Getting married doesn't fix a relationship."</p>

		<p>He sighed and looked down at his hands, admitting to himself that he had been stupid and that she was probably right.</p>

		<p>"You weren't the only culprit in this. B'Elanna had something to do with it."</p>

		<p>"She thought I was sincere and I guess I was for a little while. Things changed when we got back on the ship. Suddenly I was the Man. Women flocked to me and they would run my programs with me and listen to me. B'Elanna didn't do those things."</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Tom. I know this is very difficult for the both of you."</p>

		<p>"I want to give her the divorce."</p>
