<!-- Loitering \ Story -->

<p>Sam swirled her spoon around in her mashed potatoes restlessly as Mike  droned on about something or other around her.  It wasn't that she  didn't like Mike, the truth was that she had actually developed a sort  of affection for the man's bumbling kindness as the months wore on and  she finally accepted that he wasn't going anywhere in a hurry.  It  wasn't even that what he was talking about was particularly boring -  at least not anymore than usual - it was just that she had been  finding it increasingly hard to concentrate on anything for an  extended period of time.  And whether it was fair or not Sam blamed it  all on the wispy haired blonde girl sitting directly across from her.</p>

<p>Slowly Sam raised her head and looked across the table towards Brooke.   The cheerleader's eyes were crinkled slightly at the sides as she  smiled radiantly at something her father had said.  As Sam carefully  studied Brooke's expression she suddenly realized that she wished she  had been paying attention, or even better that she were sitting where  Mike was now.  As Sam continued to watch Brooke dropped her head down  shaking it with mock disapproval before turning around to face Sam who  quickly returned her eyes to the food in front of her.</p>

<p>Brooke watched as Sam's attention conspicuously returned to her plate.   She wanted to watch the brunette for a while longer, maybe figure out  what was going on in the beautiful head of hers, but before she could  get completely lost contemplating the mystery that was Sam McPherson  she heard Jane ask her something and turned her attention to the other  woman, forcing a smile and a look of interest onto her face.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sam hovered outside of Brooke's partially open door debating with  herself about whether she wanted to go in or not.  For a while it had  been painfully obvious that she had more than sisterly feelings for  Brooke, but things got really complicated when Sam got Brooke giving  her the same not so covert looks that she herself had been bestowing  upon the cheerleader.  Or at least she thought she had got Brooke  giving her the same looks, quite frankly she wasn't sure that she  could rule out wishful thinking, which was why she was pacing outside  of Brooke's room instead of just knocking and walking in.</p>

<p>"How much longer are you planning on standing out there?"</p>

<p>Sam looked up sharply at the sound of Brooke's voice and towards the  blonde's room.  </p>

<p>"You're not hearing things, I just didn't feel like getting up,"  Brooke called out again from somewhere in the depths of her room.</p>

<p>Sam stood there for a moment longer staring at Brooke's eggshell white  door before taking a few steps forward and awkwardly pushing the door  completely open.  Brooke was sitting on her bed with a few schoolbooks  spread out in front of her.  She was wearing, at least from what Sam  could see, extremely short shorts and a flimsy tank top.</p>

<p>"You can come in you know," Brooke said a gentle smile working it's  way across her face.  "I haven't bitten since third grade."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well the last person you bit was probably me, so you'll have to  excuse my trepidation," Sam responded nonetheless walking further into  the room  "What are you working on anyway?"</p>

<p>"Calcuology," Brooke responded waving her hand over the contents of  her bed dismissively before looking over at Sam inquisitively.  Then  after watching the brunette for a moment longer she smiled and with  one brush of her hand wiped her books off of the bed onto the floor.   "I made a space for you."</p>

<p>Sam watched Brooke carefully for a moment; the blonde's face was warm  and inviting but otherwise unreadable.  She could as well have just  said that she liked fluffy rabbits for all Sam was able to get from  her.</p>

<p>"Six months ago you would have tossed one of those at me," Sam said  perching herself on the edge of Brooke's bed.</p>

<p>"Maybe, but there would have been no reason for you to worry.  I throw  like a girl," Brooke said as she tucked her legs up underneath her  making herself more comfortable.  "If you're staying for a while you  could as well get comfortable."</p>

<p>Sam nodded absently pushing herself back onto Brooke's bed so that she  was sitting along the width of it near the bottom.  After she had  positioned herself she played around tucking her legs up so that her  head could practically rest on her knees, then stretching out so that  she was practically lying down, before finally settling on leaning on  her side facing Brooke while her head was propped on her hand.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked somewhat peevishly seeing Brooke smirking at her  once she settled herself.</p>

<p>"That was cute, I think I saw the exact same moves in a Britney Spears  video," Brooke responded smiling.  A smile, which quickly vanished  when she saw that Sam didn't find the comment nearly as funny as she  did.  "So what brings you by to my neck of the woods?  If you want to  borrow my car again, my answer still remains ass, gas or grass," she  continued ending off with a wink.</p>

<p>"What are we doing?" Sam asked.  She was certain now that Brooke had  been looking at her differently than before, and she definitely  detected that the cheerleader was now subtly flirting with her.</p>

<p>"Talking, or at least hopefully will be.  It would be horribly awkward  otherwise," Brooke responded staring Sam straight in the eye as she  spoke but dropping her gaze to her lap after she finished.</p>

<p>"How's the calcuology coming?" </p>

<p>"The calcu is going not coming, and the ology is palpitating and near  heart failure," Brooke responded glaring at the books on her floor  darkly before turning back to face Sam.  "You didn't, by any chance,  come by to do my homework did you?"</p>

<p>"Not quite," Sam said smiling.  "Truthfully I'm not sure why I…"</p>

<p>"Was loitering?"  Brooke interjected helpfully.</p>

<p>"Standing out there.  I guess…I don't know, maybe I just wanted to see  you…or something," Sam continued, her head dipped down nervously as  she looked up at Brooke furtively every few seconds.</p>

<p>Brooke observed Sam, bowed head and all, for a few moments before  responding in a low voice.  "I'm glad you stopped by.  I like it…you  know when we talk, and stuff."</p>

<p>"Thing's have changed recently, haven't they?" Sam asked looking up at  Brooke as she spoke, staring directly into the blonde's blue eyes.   "Between us," she added rather unnecessarily.  </p>

<p>Brooke held Sam's gaze, unconsciously licking her lips.  "Yeah, I  think they have.  We're closer now…I mean it's like we know each other  now."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam agreed.  "I like the person I've gotten to know, you know  the girl behind the pleated mini," she added with a smile.</p>

<p>"Really?  Highlights and all?"  Brooke asked returning Sam's tentative  grin.</p>

<p>"Yeah, a lot," Sam responded her cheeks reddening slightly.  "The  liking you, not the highlights, not that I don't like your highlights,  just that I like you more than your hair, though not really  independent of it, and I'm going to stop talking now before I make an  even bigger fool of myself."</p>

<p>"It's just me," Brooke said with a smile reaching over to poke Sam in  the shoulder lightly before settling back in her old position.   "Actually I feel kind of privileged."</p>

<p>"Privileged?" Sam asked looking at her dubiously.</p>

<p>"Yeah, how many people get to see so many of Sam McPherson's many  faces?" Brooke replied her eyes drifting around her room.  "I feel, I  mean it's cool that we're cool with each other," she went on smoothing  down her shorts which drew Sam's eyes towards her long, lean, tanned,  simply exquisite legs.</p>

<p>"You have amazing legs," Sam breathed out before she even knew what  she was saying.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked, her eyes returning to Sam's immediately.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Sam said forcing herself to remain calm.  She hadn't said  anything truly embarrassing, like I wanna eat lunch off of your ass or  something, all she had said that was Brooke had nice legs.  That was  completely coverable, girls commented on other girls bodies all the  time, sure most of them didn't crave to touch said bodies, but the  commenting itself was completely normal.  "I just said that you have  nice legs."</p>

<p>"You think so?" Brooke asked looking down at the appendages in  question questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, in fact all of you is pretty fantastic," Sam, said cursing her  mouth and the words it was spilling as it spilled them.</p>

<p>"Really?" Brooke asked with genuine doubt as she pointed stared at her  chest, which she had always wished had been better endowed.</p>

<p>"Why would I lie?" was Sam's response.</p>

<p>"Because everyone's always told you that flattery will get you  everywhere," Brooke responded returning her gaze to Sam's.</p>

<p>"What's that suppose to mean?" Sam asked even though she knew quite  well what Brooke had meant.</p>

<p>"You," Brooke started shifting on the bed so that she was practically  lying beside Sam.  "You have amazing skin.  It looks like silk,  probably feels like it too," she continued looking up at Sam  questioningly yet ambiguously.  Sam wasn't sure whether Brooke wanted  her to agree or disagree or wanted an invitation to find out for  herself.</p>

<p>"See for yourself," Sam responded willing her breathing to remain  steady as she lifted up her shirt exposing her stomach to Brooke's  gaze and touch.</p>

<p>"Are you serious?" Brooke asked looking at Sam.  "I mean, I know that  we've kind of been, but it was always just…and, and I don't know, just  are you sure?"</p>

<p>Sam merely nodded, never taking her eyes off of Brooke watching as the  blonde slowly, hesitantly reached out her hand and placed it on Sam's  stomach.  She heard Brooke gasp softly as her hand made contact with  Sam's skin, and when the blonde slowly started to caress her abdomen  with her thumb Sam's eyes closed involuntarily, her mouth parting  silently.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke said softly as she removed her hand from the brunette.   "I really like you.  I mean like you.  I probably shouldn't…you know,  I shouldn't have.  I would have told you, but we were having fun  and…could you pull your shirt back down?"</p>

<p>"You like me?" Sam breathed out.</p>

<p>"Please Sam, your shirt," Brooke said her eyes glued to Sam's raising  and falling stomach.</p>

<p>"Do you want me Brooke?" Sam asked her hand hovering by the hem of her  shirt, but not reaching to pull it back down.  She couldn't really  believe what she was hearing, but at the same time couldn't really be  too shocked by it.  Maybe the dreams she had been having, both waking  and not, and somewhat prepared her for the situation, maybe she just  hoped that Brooke felt about her the way she felt about Brooke so  badly to in her heart she had started to view it as a when not if.   Whatever the reason she found herself staring into the desire covered  face of the girl she was quite convinced she was falling in love with,  and she was completely calm.</p>

<p>"I…yes, but," Brooke started.</p>

<p>"But what?" Sam asked gently.</p>

<p>"But it's more than that.  I like you as a person, and I want to be  near you and talk to you as much as…as much as I want to touch you,"  Brooke replied softly, looking Sam directly in the eyes now that she  was fairly certain the brunette wasn't going anywhere.</p>

<p>Sam sat there watching Brooke quietly for a moment, then suddenly as  if she were afraid she would lose her nerve quickly leaned forward and  brought their lips together, bringing her hand up to the side of  Brooke's face to steady her as she deepened the kiss when Brooke  didn't pull away.</p>

<p>"I knew it," Brooke whispered as they separated.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked staring at Brooke's redder than normal lips in a  haze and she thought about making them even redder.</p>

<p>"That you'd be a good kisser," Brooke responded with a smile.</p>

<p>"Why?" </p>

<p>"Because," Brooke began reaching out her hand to touch Sam's face.   "You have the most incredible lips that I've ever seen," she continued  tracing her thumb across Sam's lips.</p>

<p>"Brooke," Sam mumbled as she tried to capture Brooke's finger with her  mouth.   "I really want to kiss you again."</p>

<p>"Don't ever say I'm not a good hostess," Brooke responded as she  leaned forward bringing their lips together once more.</p>
