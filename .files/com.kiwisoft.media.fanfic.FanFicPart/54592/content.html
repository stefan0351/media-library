<P>Kathryn was up bright and early. She was looking
  forward to the day. She decided to wear a rusty gold sweater with a pair of
  brown slacks. Her hair was easier to comb since she cut it short last year.
  She liked the style, felt it made her look a bit more mature. She headed out
  the door at seven-ten. </P>
<P>"Beep, beep, beep" the alarm sounded. Alex slammed
  her hand on top of the clock radio silencing the loud irritant. She pulled herself
  out of bed and went to Sam's room to find Sam wide away and searching for her
  clothes. </P>
<P>"You up already" Alex spoke hoarsely.</P>
<P>"Come on mommy time for school." Sam said with
  such eagerness. </P>
<P>"OK, OK, let's get you ready and then some breakfast."
  Alex replied with a yawn.</P>
<P>The pair headed out the door at seven-forty-five
  and made it to the school by seven-fifty-five.</P>
<P>"I'll see you in a little bit." Alex said as
  she kneeled down to adjust Sam's sweater and kiss her goodbye. Sam walked into
  her classroom. </P>
<P>Alex went back home to do a couple of reports
  and go over some of her worker's reports checking for errors and misused medical
  terms. She spent most of her time working until it was time to pick up Sam.
  </P>
<P>Miss Bard was finishing up her lesson before
  releasing the children. One by one she had to pin a little note on each child
  with information for their parents. "OK class looks like everyone has a note
  attached to them, so lets line up like I taught you and get ready to go outside."
  The class was very eager to get out as was Miss Bard.</P>
<P>Alex was standing the in same spot as before.
  Miss Bard saw her immediately and found herself unable to tear her eyes away.
  She let out big smile not hiding her joy at seeing Sam's mom. She felt a warmth
  in her chest as the smile was enthusiastically returned.</P>
<P>Parents again claiming their children as Miss
  Bard released them. "Hi," she directed toward Alex. "So did you run yesterday?"
  Miss Bard asked remembering how she over-watered her lawn.</P>
<P>"No, I run usually on Mondays, Wednesday and
  Fridays, my mom comes over and watches Sam for me." I wonder if she likes running.
  She's in awesome shape. </P>
<P>"I'm not really a runner, I work-out with the
  punching bag, kick boxing and some weights." That's why I didn't see her yesterday.
  </P>
<P>"I hear kick boxing is a real workout," Alex
  said. </P>
<P>"You interested in trying it sometime?" Miss
  Bard asked with raised eyebrows and a hint of a challenge.</P>
<P>"I don't know, maybe. Where do you go to work
  out?" </P>
<P>"Well, I used to go to a gym in Washington,
  but now I have everything set up at home."</P>
<P>"Washington?" Alex questioned curiously. </P>
<P>Miss Bard was just about to speak when Tracy's
  dad interrupted her. "Yea, so... Miss Bard I was ah, wonderin' if you'd go over
  some of this information with me" He showed her the paper she had pinned on
  Tracy's chest. It was a census sheet that the school forgot to send out with
  the general package. </P>
<P>Alex could have sworn she saw a bit of disappointment
  in Miss Bard's face. "Well, we'll see you tomorrow. Sam say goodbye to your
  teacher." She said not really wanting to leave so hastily.</P>
<P>"Goodbye you two." Miss Bard waved then turned
  to give her attention to Frank. OK, I am the teacher, pull yourself together.
  She thought as she focused on the parent before her.</P>
<P>The rest of the week went by rather smoothly.
  Miss Bard missed seeing Alex on Wednesday and Thursday. She had to meet with
  the hospital and clinic that she transcribes for, so her mother picked up Sam
  on both days. </P>
<P>On Friday Alex found she missed seeing the lovely
  kindergarten teacher. She eagerly walked to the school to pick up her daughter.
  </P>
<P>As the students came out of room twenty-one,
  Alex felt her heart quicken, Miss Bard came out holding Sam's hand, they were
  both smiling. Alex liked the picture she saw. I can't believe I have such a
  crush on Sam's teacher. She thought.</P>
<P>Miss Bard wanted to talk to Alex but found it
  difficult due to the other parents and children surrounding her.</P>
<P>Alex hugged Sammy and briefly said hello to
  the teacher but realized that was about the extent of it. She waved and the
  pair walked away leaving Miss Bard in the realm of questions, praises, and school
  gossip. </P>

<hr>

<P>Finally Wednesday came around and Alex would
  be volunteering in Sam's classroom. She was really excited and felt like she
  was going to a new job. She really hadn't worked outside her home since Sam
  was born. She liked the feeling of something different.</P>
<P>Sam was just as excited. "You're coming in later
  right mommy?" Samantha asked as her mom walked her to her classroom.</P>
<P>"Yep, I'll be here honey, love you."</P>
<P>At nine-forty-five, Alex drove back to the school
  and as she walked into the classroom, Miss Bard was showing the class some cards
  with pictures on them. They were naming the colors.</P>
<P>Miss Bard was sitting on a little chair and
  the class was seated on the floor with their legs crossed.</P>
<P>"Hi" Miss Bard said with a big smile.</P>
<P>The students turned to see Alex standing in
  the doorway. </P>
<P>"Hi mommy" Sam yelled out.</P>
<P>"Class this is Mrs., Ms., Miss Trout?" All of
  a sudden Miss Bard wasn't sure of the title. She looked at Alex hesitantly.
  </P>
<P>"Just call me Alex."</P>
<P>"Ok, class this is Alex, she's Samantha's mom."
  </P>
<P>"Let's give her a good morning welcome," Miss
  Bard said. </P>
<P>She lead the class first then they joined in
  unison, "Good morning Alex." </P>
<P>Alex couldn't help but laugh, "Good morning
  class." </P>
<P>Miss Bard called Alex over to where she was
  standing. "How about reading the class a story, while I set up the work stations?"
  </P>
<P>"Sure, what did you have in mind?"</P>
<P>Miss Bard walked over to the little bookshelf
  and selected a book for Alex to read.</P>
<P>"Here, this is a fun one."</P>
<P>"The Very Hungry Caterpillar," Alex read the
  title of the book Miss Bard was holding.</P>
<P>Miss Bard opened the book and held the bottom
  with the front facing the students. "Here, when you read, take your time so
  that everyone could see the pictures."</P>
<P>Alex grinned, "I think I can handle that," she
  then placed both of her hands under Miss Bard's, to take the book.</P>
<P>Miss Bard felt a charge of electricity at the
  sudden touch of Alex's hands. Alex felt it too. She looked into the teacher's
  eyes and desperately held back a sigh.</P>
<P>Miss Bard let the book go and breathed in, "I'll
  um, be over there," her words stumbled.</P>
<P>Alex let out her breath as soon as Miss Bard
  turned to walk away. The students were sitting waiting for their story to begin.
  </P>
<P>"Mommy, aren't you gonna read to us," Sam spoke
  up. </P>
<P>"Oh&#133; yea&#133; sorry," Alex suddenly realized
  she had an audience. </P>
<P>"The Very Hungry Caterpillar, by Eric Carle"
  She began as she seated herself on the floor.</P>
<P>Miss Bard was at the other end of the classroom
  putting picture cards on the table.</P>
<P>Holy smokes, what was that, I don't know if
  I can concentrate with her this close to me. Kathryn thought to herself. Ok,
  just try not to think of how beautiful&#133;Kathryn looked over to the front
  of the class. Alex's raven colored hair was pulled over to one side, it shone
  with such darkness that all the colors around her were faded and dulled. Except
  for her eyes. They sparkled like two diamonds resting in a pool of blue. Kathryn
  felt a lump in her throat.</P>
<P>"And on Wednesday he ate through three plums,
  but what?" She read and asked the class.</P>
<P>"He was still hungry," some of the students
  answered. </P>
<P>Alex laughed out loud. She occasionally looked
  up to see Miss Bard, who had stopped what she was doing to listen to the rest
  of the story. It was hard for her not look at the kindergarten teacher and focus
  on the students at hand.</P>
<P>Finally she came to the end of the story. "He
  built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself. He stayed inside for more
  than two weeks. Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and&#133;he
  was." Alex read the last, then spoke it while looking at Miss Bard, "a beautiful
  butterfly." </P>
<P>Miss Bard let out a sigh.</P>
<P>The class cheered.</P>
<P>Miss Bard walked to the front of the class and
  placed her hand on Alex's shoulder. "That was great," she said.</P>
<P>Alex smiled, "Thanks."</P>
<P>"Ok, boys and girls, we are going to divide
  the class and work in two work stations," Miss Bard explained. She called out
  ten of the students and assigned them to table one, which was her table. Then
  the remaining ten went to table two, which would be Alex's table. </P>
<P>"Alex, you can sit here on the big chair" Miss
  Bard showed Alex the chair which wasn't really that big. If she did sit on it,
  she wouldn't be able to put her knees under the desk. They looked at each other
  and started laughing. </P>
<P>"Why don't I just sit on the floor," Alex suggested.
  </P>
<P>"Great idea" Miss Bard replied.</P>
<P>Alex sat on the floor with her legs crossed.
  She put them under the desk. She was just the right size now. Miss Bard stood
  behind her. She put one of her hands on Alex's shoulder and leaned in to show
  her cards that were on the table with pictures of animals on them.</P>
<P>Miss Bard swallowed, she could feel her heart
  racing, "this is called um&#133;animal phonics, we are just going to learn the
  first three. If you will, go over each sound and hand motion. Like this ah ah
  alligator" she motioned her hands like the mouth of an alligator. Then she showed
  her how to do the letters, B, and C. boy that was&#133;something. She thought.
  </P>
<P>"Sounds easy enough," Alex said. Hmm she smells
  good. </P>
<P>The students worked on their assignments while
  both Alex and the teacher supervised them. every so often glancing at each other.
  </P>
<P>Sam sat next to her mommy. "Mommy, can I get
  a drink of water?" </P>
<P>"Sure honey."</P>
<P>Sam got up out of her seat and went to the sink
  to drink some water from the drinking attachment. Then she went back to the
  table. She stood behind her mommy and stroked the back of Alex's hair. "Miss
  Bard, doesn't my mommy have pretty hair?" Sam called to her teacher at the other
  table. </P>
<P>Miss Bard looked up at Alex. "Yes she does,
  she has beau-ti-ful hair." And beautiful eyes, and&#133;stop.</P>
<P>"Sam why don't you sit down and let's work on
  our letter C." Alex said. She looked at Miss Bard and shook her head with a
  hint of a smile. That kid of mine.</P>
<P>At ten-forty-five Miss Bard asked the children
  to start cleaning up so they can go to recess.</P>
<P>Once everything was put away, the students lined
  up and headed outside to play. Miss Bard stood at the door and watched the children
  head out to the play area.</P>
<P>"How are they doing?" Alex asked as she walked
  up to the smaller woman. </P>
<P>"Well, its just the beginning, we're working
  on the very basics, we started with the pledge of allegiance. The animal phonics
  takes a while because it's broken down, but eventually they'll learn all of
  it." </P>
<P>"Boy you have to have a lot of patience." I
  doubt if I have that much with twenty kids.</P>
<P>"I've been teaching for a while now, but you
  just never know what's going to come up." Miss Bard said as they headed outside
  to the play area. </P>
<P>"Mommy will you push us on the swing?"</P>
<P>"Sure honey. " Alex said as she walked over
  to the swings with the two little girls on either side of her hands.</P>
<P>Some of the little boys were riding the tricycles.
  Miss Bard walked over to them and watched them play.</P>
<P>The class had recess for about fifteen minutes.
  Miss Bard called them all in. It took a bit longer as each student wanted to
  get a drink of water. </P>
<P>"Ok, boys and girls, we are going read another
  story. Alex is going to help with this story. We are going to learn about up
  and down." Miss Bard said as she opened the book she would read.</P>
<P>Alex helped with a couple more activities until
  it was time for her to leave. "Sam, I'll be back in a little bit ok." Alex whispered
  to Sam. </P>
<P>"So how'dya, like working with the children?"
  Miss Bard asked. </P>
<P>"It was kinda fun. Do they usually attach themselves
  to you." Alex was surprised at the way the children would huddle around her
  and grab her hands or touch her hair.</P>
<P>"You get used to it, the girls especially, they
  like to play with long hair. My hair was really long last year and the girls
  were always stroking it." Miss Bard said as she reached over and touched Alex's
  hair. </P>
<P>"Just the little girls huh?" Alex said with
  a grin. </P>
<P>"Sorry, your hair is beautiful, I couldn't resist"
  Miss Bard blushed. </P>
<P>"Don't worry, it doesn't bother me." I can get
  to like this. Alex chuckled. "Sam is always running her little fingers through
  my hair. I was thinking about the kick boxing." Alex started.</P>
<P>"Yea, it's a really great workout." Miss Bard
  found herself interrupting before she realized what she was doing. "If you're
  interested, maybe I could show you a few things?"</P>
<P>The students were becoming louder, Miss Bard
  picked up her bell and rang it, and the children began to put their hands on
  top of their heads. </P>
<P>"Maybe&#133;" Alex grinned.</P>
<P>Miss Bard had to return to being the teacher
  because the class could only keep their hands on their heads for a brief moment
  before they started up again.</P>
<P>Alex looked at her and already knew she wanted
  to see her outside the classroom. She sighed, "OK, I'll see you later." </P>
<P>"Class let's tell Alex thank you for helping
  today." </P>
<P>"Thank you Alex." The class said unison. </P>
<P>"Your very welcome." Alex said with a wave.
  Then she walked out the door letting out a big breath of air. She's something.
  Whew! What should I do for thirty-minutes?</P>
<P>It was just a few minutes past twelve when Alex
  returned. Miss Bard was standing at the fence with Sam and two other children.
  </P>
<P>"There's your mommy" Miss Bard said to Sam.
  </P>
<P>"Hey, I went to the store." Alex said with a
  huff. </P>
<P>"So what about the kick boxing?" Miss Bard asked
  with a gleam in her hazel eyes. "It's a great work-out, different from the same
  old running." Don't try so hard, she looks interested.</P>
<P>"Ok, but it has to be on a Monday, Wednesday
  or&#133;" </P>
<P>"I know Friday. How about tonight, you know
  where I live, just come over around the time you were going to run." Miss Bard
  said with great enthusiasm. "Your gonna love this."</P>
<P>"I'm sure I will." Alex said feeling an incandescent
  heat come over her. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I'll see you this evening then about six."
  Alex said while claiming Sam's hand. "Come on sweetheart let's go get some lunch."
  Kick boxing oh boy. </P>

<hr>

<P>Alex left the house as usual. She didn't tell
  her mom she was going to Miss Bard's house to exercise. She jogged her regular
  route around the long block but didn't go onto the track. She figured kickboxing
  wouldn't be that difficult, just kicking, and jumping around, maybe. </P>
<P>"Ding dong." The doorbell rang. Alex could hear
  music coming from inside the house. Maybe she didn't hear the bell. Just as
  Alex was going to press the button, the door opened.</P>
<P>"Hey, you made it" Kathryn spoke gleefully.
  </P>
<P>"Why wouldn't I" Alex returned.</P>
<P>Kathryn was wearing red boxing shorts with a
  white tank top. She had a headband on which made Alex think of Olivia Newton
  John in the video Physical.</P>
<P>"Let's get physical." She sang out with one
  arched eyebrow. </P>
<P>Kathryn looked herself up and down. "Funny,
  ha, ha. Come inside." </P>
<P>Alex was wearing a blue jogging sweat suit.
  "So what are you going to do to me Miss Bard." Alex asked with a rather seductive
  tone. </P>
<P>Kathryn gulped. She felt a rush of heat run
  up her entire body. "Hey, we're not in school. Call me Kathryn." She stuttered
  trying to regain her composure. </P>
<P>"Is that what your friends call you, Kath-ryn"
  Alex said slowly as if tasting the name.</P>
<P>"Well, my very good friends just call me Kat&#133;
  who knows, maybe I'll let you call me that one day." She spoke teasingly. </P>
<P>"I could only wish." Alex whispered back. </P>
<P>The two women went out to the back patio where
  Kathryn had a mini gym set up. She had some free weights seated on a black mat
  on the floor. A punching back that hung from the patio rooftop and a universal
  machine. </P>
<P>"Wow, I guess you take your workout pretty seriously."
  Alex said. Maybe I shouldn'ta run over here. "You will be gentle won'tcha."
  Alex tried to sound panicky.</P>
<P>"Hmm, we'll see." Kathryn said as her eyes sparkled.
  </P>
<P>Kathryn demonstrated her stretching techniques
  which Alex repeated. They then began a simple front kick, then a sidekick. It
  wasn't much of a challenge for Alex. Which Kathryn noted, so she demonstrated
  some other kicks and some punches. They lasted about thirty minutes. Alex ended
  up taking her sweat top off leaving her in a black tank top that matched her
  hair. At the end of the session, both women were drenched in sweat. </P>
<P>"I'll get us some water." Kathryn said as she
  walked into the house. On the way back outside, she watched Alex hit the bag
  a few times. Her shoulders were blazing and her long raven-hair glistening with
  sweat. Damn, I wonder if she knows how sexy she looks. Ok get hold of your self.
  "Here." She handed Alex a glass of water.</P>
<P>"Thanks." Alex drank the water as if she had
  been wandering the desert for days. "That's good. You have a really nice set
  up here." She said in between breaths.</P>
<P>"I just moved in during the summer. I stayed
  with my dad until I found a place near the school. I like it."</P>
<P>"Yea, you said you lived in Washington?" Alex
  asked as she patted her self with the towel Kathryn handed her.</P>
<P>"Yea, Vancouver, I lived there since I was about
  ten. My mom," Kathryn paused trying to get the word out, "died last year and
  I wanted to be near my dad." </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"I'm really sorry." Alex responded empathetically.
  "My father past away last August. It changes you forever."</P>
<P>"I know what you mean. Sometimes I... pick up
  the phone and start dialing to call my mom," she hesitated, "then I remember
  she's not here anymore." Kathryn's eyes began to water. Don't cry. </P>
<P>Alex saw it coming. "Hey, its ok." She reached
  out for Kathryn. </P>
<P>The young teacher felt a force pull her toward
  the taller woman she needed the embrace and at that moment both women knew they
  had found a friend. </P>
<P>Alex held tightly to Kathryn for what seemed
  like both seconds and an eternity. She suddenly felt a protective feeling like
  the kind when Sam is scared or hurt, she knew she wanted to protect this woman,
  she wasn't sure why, she just knew.</P>
<P>Kathryn broke away first. "I'm really sorry,
  I didn't mean to..." She said a bit uneasily.</P>
<P>Alex smiled and placed her hands on Kathryn's
  shoulders. "No, don't apologize. When my father died, I couldn't cry. I don't
  know why, I wanted to, but he always said not to be sad when he goes. I knew
  he was ok." She struggled with her words. "My family thought I was crazy for
  not crying, they didn't understand, but I just couldn't." </P>
<P>The two women stood quietly for a moment, taking
  in what just happened. </P>
<P>"Alex."</P>
<P>"Hmm."</P>
<P>"You're so easy to talk to."</P>
<P>Alex let out a laugh. "You think so?"</P>
<P>"Yea, you make me feel very&#133;"</P>
<P>"Comfortable." Alex finished her sentence. </P>
<P>"Yea." Kathryn grinned.</P>
<P>"Well, Kath-ry-n, so do you."</P>
<P>"Alex."</P>
<P>"Yea."</P>
<P>"Call me Kat." Kathryn said with a smile. </P>
<P>"Kat." Alex said as she capriciously poked at
  Kathryn's midsection. </P>
<P>"Hey." Kathryn giggled.</P>
<P>"I gotta get back. My mother is probably wondering
  what happened to me." Alex said like a teenager late from curfew. "What are
  you doing Friday?" </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Actually I'm having dinner at my dad's house,
  but I can cancel, why what'da have in mind?" Kathryn asked with a hint of excitement.
  </P>
<P>"Well, I figured since I worked out with you,
  you could run a bit with me." </P>
<P>"Oh, um..."</P>
<P>"What." Alex asked.</P>
<P>"I was hoping you were going to invite me to
  a movie or something. I'm really not a runner."</P>
<P>"Oh, you're not huh? Well Sam is going to spend
  the night with grandma, so I guess I could probably...well...maybe skip a day
  of running." She said trying not too sound interested.</P>
<P>"You'd give up one day for me." Kathryn replied
  as she stood up on her toes and leaned her head toward Alex's like a child on
  the verge of getting her way.</P>
<P>She is just so darn cute. Alex felt so at ease,
  she wrapped her arms around Kathryn and gave her a hug. "Come on, walk me out."
  </P>
