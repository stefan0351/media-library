<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 6: Bran Flakes! -->

<p>"Are you feeling better now Sammy?"</p>
<p>"As good as can be." Sam flashed her girlfriend her best smile only to get Brooke off her back. The blonde had been nagging about the throwing up all day asking if she was okay every five minutes.</p>
<p>It was lunchtime and the girls and Lily were "enjoying" their school lunch and making small talk. Actually, Lily was doing all of the talking and the other two nodded and hummed in the right places. Lily was furious over the gift basket she was sure Mary Cherry had sent to her. Not only was she offended by the fact that she was sent part of dead animals to her house, the person who send it was clearly claiming that she was too skinny.</p>
<p>"I am not too skinny! Aren't I?"</p>
<p>"Uh... No! Of course not." The two other girls answered simultaneously.</p>
<p>After a while, Carmen joined their table complaining about some sophomore girls not liking her new routines.</p>
<p>"Isn't PMS just a bitch?" Carmen complained. "I've got such a craving for bran flakes and I don't even know why. I just want to stuff my self with a whole box of dry cereal."</p>
<p>"That is SO disgusting Carmen." Sam said making a face and feeling something very strange going on in her stomach.</p>
<p>"Sam, I though you liked dry cereals. You always stuff yourself with rice krispies in the mornings and..."</p>
<p>Sam storming off with her hands covering her mouth interrupted Brooke mid sentence. She made a straight line towards the toilets knocking over several sophomore kids. The girls around the table sat silent for a while exchanging concerned looks.</p>
<p>"What's up with Sam?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." Brooke sighed. "She's been like this since yesterday. All of the sudden she runs up to throw up. Oh God! You don't think she has some strange eating disorder, do you?"</p>
<p>"Aren't eating disorders usually a little more discrete than storming off from a crowded cafeteria holding your hands over your mouth?" Carmen asked looking at the direction Sam had gone.</p>
<p>"Maybe she's got the stomach flue." Lily offered.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't she be all fevery and sweaty and weak in that case?"</p>
<p>"Maybe she's allergic to something in the food?" Lily suggested poking at Sam's food.</p>
<p>"Here she comes!" Brooke spoke up for the first during Lily and Carmen's game of "what makes Sammy vomit."</p>
<p>Sam slowly walked towards her table holding one hand over her stomach and the other over her forehead. She had just experience the feeling of throwing up more amounts of fluid than she had consumed that day. She had never in her life felt like this. It didn't resemble either stomach flue nor food poisoning or any other inconvenience her stomach had experienced. However, the last thing she wanted was to see a doctor. After all the time in hospital and the regular examinations after the accident, she would rather agree to another make over done by Mary Cherry. Despite the fact that Mary Cherry's last make over had ended up with her almost burning Sam's hair off.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Brooke asked worriedly as the brunette approached the table.</p>
<p>"I'm fine. Just some post-disgorge dizziness, that's all."</p>
<p>Sam slowly sat down in front of Brooke as three sets of eyes followed her every move.</p>
<p>"You aren't all fevery, are you?" Carmen asked her.</p>
<p>"Not that I know of."</p>
<p>"Is there something in the food that made you sick? Like that thing that is supposed to be a sausage? Lily asked poking around Sam's plate again.</p>
<p>"No!" Sam slapped Lily's hand away. "I think it's ulcer."</p>
<p>"That's one violent ulcer you've got!" Carmen chuckled.</p>
<p>"You can always try to sue the school for food poisoning." Emory Dick all of the sudden appeared from behind Lily.</p>
<p>Lily turned around and hit him over the head with a straw. "Haven't your parents taught you that it is rude to listen to other peoples conversations?"</p>
<p>"I do believe they have. However, that does not keep me from doing it now." Emory said in his usual haughty kind of way.</p>
<p>Carmen glared at him. "Emory, make like an egg and scramble."</p>
<p>"Point taken." He disappeared only to reappear one second later. "Think about it Sam."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I will, Emory." Sam said kindly only to prevent Carmen from hitting him with the apple she held in her hand.</p>
<p>"I have so not forgiven him over that distended anus thing."</p>
<p>"Carm, that happened like two years ago."</p>
<p>"But do you know that people still comment on it?"</p>
<p>The other three girls burst in to laughter but Carmen just shrugged, not able to see the funny side of the whole thing. That distended anus thing made her the victim of many crude jokes.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you are okay now Sammy?" Brooke took Sam's hand in hers.</p>
<p>"Yes! Jesus, Brooke. Obsessive much? You have to stop asking if I am okay every five minutes! I might have to slap you if you ask again."</p>
<p>"But I'm worried Sam. What if there's something wrong with you? Maybe something to do with the accident?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry Brooke." Sam tried to give the blonde her best reassuring smile. "Apart from the scars and sporadic stiffness in my right leg, I'm fine. Just don't talk about cereals. Or wheat, rye, barley and oats."</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other, then at Sam, then back at each other. Brooke hoped Sam was only joking or had some damn good explanation. Otherwise, she would have to take Sam to the hospital to get her head checked for any side effects from that head trauma.</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at me like that? It was Carmen's cereal talk that got me all sick."</p>
<p>"You got sick cause I am PMSing?"</p>
<p>"No, I got sick cause you were talking about cereals." Sam felt her stomach starting to turn again and wasn't very keen on running to the toilets again. "Let's change the subject, please."</p>
<p>"Nah, wait. First you've got to explain the cereal thing." Lily was really interested in what Sam had to say. Little did she know, Sam was getting a free ticket to puke-land again.</p>
<p>"If I tell you I might have to..."</p>
<p>"Kill you?" Carmen asked amused.</p>
<p>"No, throw up."</p>
<p>"Sam, come on!" Brooke whined pulling at Sam's arm.</p>
<p>"You guys, not changing the subject here." Sam said making a face. The other girls gave her a dirty look and Sam realized they were not letting her of the hook. "Okay, every time I think about or eat cereals I get this really odd feeling in my stomach, and then my insides start racing up my throat."</p>
<p>Carmen and Lily made disgusted faces as if Sam had told them she dirt. Brooke looked at Sam as if she had told her she was giving up journalism for cheerleading. I.e. Brooke was bewildered.</p>
<p>"Changing the subject now," Sam broke the silence, "how's mid terms going?"</p>
<p>Carmen was the first one to react. "Oh! I'm... Not so good."</p>
<p>Lily was second. "It would be going better if Ms Glass had given us a better study plan other than "Study your notes." Is it legal to that cruel towards your students?"</p>
<p>"It must me in this state." Carmen muttered standing up. "I'll se you guys later."</p>
<p>"See you Carm." Sam said gathering her things to leave. "I have to take care of some things before next period."</p>
<p>"You promise to get that ulcer checked?" Lily asked.</p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes. She really appreciated her friends concerns. However, this time it was more an aggravation than appreciated.</p>
<p>"I promise." Such a lie, Sam thought. She bent down to kiss Brooke (who had been awfully quite during lunch period) on the top of her head. "I'll see you later princess."</p>
<p>"See ya Sam."</p>
<p>Lily took a minute to contemplate Brooke. The blonde looked perplexed and bothered and just really not like the blazing, bubbly teen she should look like. Lily reckoned it was time for some damage control.</p>
<p>"Brooke? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Brooke sighed and clutched her head in her hands, resting her elbows on the table. "She so damn stubborn! I know she won't go to the doctor until that damn ulcer knocks her out. What if it isn't ulcer? What if she's walking around with some strange, deadly disease?"</p>
<p>"Brooke, breath. Relax. I'm sure Sam will be okay. I'll talk to her. And if she doesn't listen to me; we can get Carmen to help us lure her to the health center."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled. She didn't like the idea of having to force Sam to see a doctor bearing in mind everything the brunette had gone through the last six moths. However, she would die from anxiety if Sam continued like that.</p>
<p>"I think we need to start working on a plan right away."</p>
