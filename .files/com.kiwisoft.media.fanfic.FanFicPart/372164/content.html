<P>a/n: well if my chapters suck I'll try to add in a cutesy(I hope) and funny(I hope) part in the end…like I did with the last two…idk how cutesy or funny they were though :( haha…so I'll tryy to make this a good chapter. I've just been so stressed out lately. There's some douchebag in the barn where I keep my cow stealing all my shit for her goat&pig in there…and ohh god idk it's just so lame I'm worried if her creepy dad is going to mess with my cow or steal some of my expensive shit I have in there for her. Anyways, that was my rant of the day…..on with the story…</P><P>Chapter Eight: (S)he Could Be The One ;)</P><P>"This is Cat," I said, holding up my morbidly obese tabby cat. "We found her on the side of the road when she was a kitten; we've had her about five years now…she's a bit of a fatty." I added as she hung limply in my hands, looking at me with dopey eyes as if saying, 'Won't you feed me some more? Or carry me over to my food dish?'</P><P>Lilly laughed, and took her from me, resting Cat's head on her shoulder as she struggled to hold her fat body with out dropping her, "She's so cute."</P><P>"Don't lie," I mumbled, "She's pretty fat…"</P><P>"But still cute," She held Cat in front of her face, "You're a cutie, don't listen to mean ole Miley."</P><P>I couldn't help but smile; mostly people ignored our fat kitty…I mean really, what is there to say about a fat cat besides, 'Put that thing on a diet!'. "Well, I think she likes you."</P><P>"I hope so, I'm gonna be carrying her around all night. She's my new found love."</P><P>"Soo…who is your other love?" I asked, pointing at myself and winking.</P><P>Lilly narrowed her eyes at me, "Hot dogs."</P><P>"You really like food huh? Maybe that's why you and Cat clicked so well!"</P><P>"Are you calling me fat?" She asked looking hurt.</P><P>"No! …god no." I took the chance to check her out, "Definitely not." She stood there with her head cocked to the side, Cat's lard resting on her hip as if she was a baby, her tight shirt clinging to her…with her shorts showing off her nice...toned, shapely legs. "Oh no…you are definitely not fat…you're so h-h…"</P><P>She narrowed her eyes at me again, "I hope you aren't staring at my chest and you're actually looking at Cat."</P><P>I shook my head, averting my eyes from her chest, "Oh, yeah…here lemme take that fatty from you, I have to give her dinner." I took Cat carrying her into the kitchen setting her on the floor by her large food dish.</P><P>"I think I forgot to mention….I love your house. It's so huge." Lilly looked around in awe at our kitchen, that was quite large with all new appliances in it.</P><P>"You don't have a big house in California?" I asked, she seemed like she came from a well enough off family if her mom had enough money to pay for her to stay at our bed and breakfast for a month while her mom went to a pricey spa.</P><P>"It's big…but it's not…homey, or nearly this nice." She frowned at me, "Plus, mom would rather spend our money going places…not on our house."</P><P>"Why's that?" I asked as I reached into once of the cabinets for Cat's cat food.</P><P>"Oh…just cause of reas-" She stopped talking as she watched me pour cat food into Cat's bowl until it was full. "You aren't like going to measure that out? That's a lot of food for a cat…"</P><P>"Like I said, she thinks she's a horse." I shrugged and patted Cat on the back as she waddled over to her food.</P><P>"No wonder she so fat…" Lilly muttered.</P><P>"She might be fat, but she's still my baby." I said talking in a baby voice to Cat. Then I stood up, "Do you want to go to my room? Watch something on t.v. maybe?"</P><P>"Sure," She smiled, following me as I left the kitchen and headed up the stairs to my room.</P><P>"So," I pushed open the door, "This is my room."</P><P>She looked around, with a slightly shocked look on her face. "It's…uh, well…different."</P><P>I looked at my king sized bed, with clothes strewn all over the floor, the long line of cowboy boots in the corner of my room next to the dresser where I had flat screened t.v. sitting, the walls painted a regular blue color, with my pink drapes over the windows, and the cat bed in the corner for when Cat decided to come upstairs. "Looks cozy to me." I shrugged.</P><P>She laughed, "I guess…my mother would flip if she saw this though, everything has to be perfectly put away and nothing odd…" She looked over at my boots, "Can be showing in the room."</P><P>"Well, I'm glad your mom won't be in my room ever, cause I'm not gonna clean it for her!" I jumped onto my bed, "Ahh, so nice…after a long day, I could just…sleep here, now." I pulled one of the many quilts on the bed over me. "Come lay with me Lilly…and turn the lights off."</P><P>She clicked the lights off uncertainly, "Okay…" She crawled onto my bed, kicking her shoes off onto the floor, kneeling beside me on the bed; I pulled her down so she was lying with me.</P><P>"That's better." I grinned.</P><P>She sighed, a sigh sounding like defeat.</P><P>"Aw, Lilly," I mumbled into the sheets, pulling her closer to me. "So cute."</P><P>She leaned towards me a little closer.</P><P>Turning my head to look at her, I saw her looking at my curiously. "Yes Lilly?"</P><P>She continued to look at my closely for a couple more seconds, "Close your eyes."</P><P>"Okay…" I closed them, "You better not do anything gross like burp on m-"</P><P>She pressed her lips gently against mine, and I slowly kissed her back, realizing what was going on after a couple of seconds…and after I got my fluttering, spastic heart under slightly better control. I felt her tongue brush lightly against my lip, just as I was about to part my lips slightly, she pulled away looking flushed. "Sorry, I just had to try…"</P><P>"Oh." I said, breathing faster than normal… "Maybe you should, uh, try again."</P><P>She laughed, grabbing a pillow she smushed it onto my head. "Oh Miley, you're so cute." She sighed, then pulled the pillow under her head. "Buut, now that you had mentioned it…this bed is pretty nice, and I am pretty tired."</P><P>"Aw, c'mon Lilly! You can't do that to me." I pouted.</P><P>"Shush, maybe in the morning." She closed her eyes smiling.</P><P>a/n: sooo, how was this chapter? Good or not so good? I'm tryingg….maybe not my hardest, but I'm trying. Usually this comes so easy to me but…right now it's taking me awhile to think about how to make everything pan out… I know how I want it to end, but I don't know how to get it there. :(</P>
