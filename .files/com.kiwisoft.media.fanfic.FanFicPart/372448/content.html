<p>The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 3 by patricia51</p>
<p>(I didn't expect the rating to go until the next chapter but Alex surprised me. Naughty Alex! Now rated "M". And my thanks to switchfoot13 for getting me to hurry along with this chapter by posting her very good story about Alex and Juliet. And we promise it was sheer coincidence that put Alex in her bedroom in both of them as we were writing at the same time.)</p>
<p>"It's about your girlfriend."</p>
<p>Oh Hell. Alex decided to see if she could bluff her way through it.</p>
<p>"Justin, what are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"I'm talking about you and that cute girl who works at the Late Nite Bite."</p>
<p>Without thinking Alex blurted out "Juliet."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Her name is Juliet."</p>
<p>"Oh, Okay then. Juliet. The girl you had a date with this evening."</p>
<p>"Once again Justin, what ARE you talking about? Date?"</p>
<p>"I'm talking about the girl I saw you holding hands with. I'm talking about the girl whose hair you brushed from her face. I'm talking about someone who made you face light up like no one else I've ever seen do to you. THAT girl."</p>
<p>"Justin, were you spying on me?" She panicked. "And I can explain about the kiss."</p>
<p>"No Alex I was not spying on you. I did wonder whose phone number was on the menu and I wandered over that way. But my purpose was to take another look at the... what kiss?"</p>
<p>Alex moaned to herself. Why hadn't she kept her mouth shut? Then her eyes brightened. She could use a spell to make Justin forget what she had just said.</p>
<p>Before she could act on her impulse Justin firmly took her hand. "Alex, no spells. I'm not going to tell anyone."</p>
<p>"Why not?" Alex was surprised. "I figured you would love having something like this to hold over my head."</p>
<p>"Alex, if it was something minor like you busted a dish or screwed up another spell than sure. But this is too important." Her brother smiled at her. "Big things call for big brothers to worry about their little sisters."</p>
<p>"That's sweet," said Alex. Realizing she had just complimented her brother she tried to switch gears. But for once she couldn't think of a thing to insult or tease Justin with. Darn him for being so nice and understanding. "Seriously Justin. It's not what you think. Juliet and I are just friends. Really. I DID kiss her but it was a spur of the moment thing. I doubt it will happen again." Even as Alex declared that her stomach turned over at the thought of never kissing Juliet again.</p>
<p>Justin rolled his eyes. He wasn't buying what Alex was selling. He could tell she was struggling with her feelings. He didn't want to push her but things were about to get extremely interesting, to say the least, based on what he had found out and he needed Alex to face the truth about how she felt.</p>
<p>"Alex, look at yourself and answer this question. Are you genuinely attracted to Juliet?" Justin was sure he knew the answer already. But Alex had to see it herself.</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Alex thought. "Justin, what am I going to do?" she asked plaintively. "I can't believe this is happening." She started pacing back and forth. "This can't be happening. Justin, I'm not gay!"</p>
<p>He nodded. "But?" he said, not realizing he was echoing Juliet's earlier question.</p>
<p>"But I am attracted to her," Alex whispered. "In fact, I'm falling in love with her. How can that be? I've never had sexual thoughts about any other girl."</p>
<p>Justin shrugged. "I don't think it's about sex, or your being a lesbian Alex. I think it's about you falling in love with another person who happens to be another girl."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you are taking this whole thing so calmly."</p>
<p>"Alex, you re my sister. Regardless of our competition or anything else I care about you and want you to be happy. Besides, we have bigger fish to fry."</p>
<p>"Oh gosh what else?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it tonight. Tomorrow will be time enough."</p>
<p>Alex nodded. "Okay." But she still found she had to ask. "Is it about Mom and Dad? What do you think they will say?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." admitted Justin. "But let me point out that they both know about love and what you give up for it. Remember, Dad surrendered his powers to marry Mom. And sometimes the hints I get from the wizard side of the family makes me think they thought that marrying a mortal was really something out of bounds. Your falling for another girl is minor compared to that. Now then," he put his hand on her shoulder and gently pushed her. "Go to bed."</p>
<p>Alex went to bed but sleep eluded her. She rolled back and forth, tossed and turned. She beat up her pillow trying to get it in just the right shape. And her mind never stopped whirling. Finally she kicked off the covers, propped herself up on her abused pillow and thought.</p>
<p>What was she going to do? She still didn't understand what was going on. She thoguht about other girls; Harper, Gigi (Yuck), the "Copy-Cat Crew" (double Yuck), Nellie, Jenny, Miranda and a host of other girls. None of them did the slightest thing for her. No arousal or interest at all. But Juliet was different. Alex thought back to the kiss and to the feel of the other girl's body against hers and that memory made her breath quickly and her pulse speed up.</p>
<p>Alex raised her hips from the bed and tugged her t-shirt up around her neck before relaxing back on the bed. Her left hand covered her now exposed breast. The right hand slowly slid down her tummy and between her legs, Two fingers hooked the hem of her panties and pulled them to the side.</p>
<p>Her thumb touched her brown hardness of her nipple and began to stroke it. Her other fingers parted her and glided up and down along her wet slit. She kept Juliet fixed in her mind as her breathing speeded up and her body quivered under the assault of her fingers. She imagined the other girl with her, touching her as she touched herself and returning the favor to the slender long haired girl.</p>
<p>Squelching sounds came from between her legs. She strummed her nipple furiously. Then her other thumb found her secret pearl peeking from under its hood and she began to roll it, tap it, rub it. She could see Juliet; see her face twisted in pleasure just as Alex knew her own was right now. The first shudders ran through her body. She arched in anticipation of her explosion.</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhhhhh. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!" burst from a long haired brunette's lips as she bucked wildly in the butterfly decorated coffin she slept in. Or rather wasn't sleeping in at this moment but doing something very wide-awake. "Alex, Alex, Alex," Juliet moaned as her own very busy fingers brought on her release, the image of a lovely dark-haired girl fixed in her mind.</p>
<p>"Wow," muttered Alex, unaware of what had just transpired not too far away from her. "That was lovely." She snuggled down into the bed. With Juliet's face before her eyes she smiled, curled up and slipped off to once again dream about someone who was rapidly becoming to center of her world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a certain teen vampire squirmed comfortably in her coffin and drifted off to sleep herself. Smile was on her face and Alex was in her thoughts.</p>
<p>Morning came and once again Alex felt wonderful. She tempered her enthusiasm though, both from a desire not to reveal yet what was going on with Juliet until she was sure herself and also from a foreboding over what Justin was ging to tell the family today. She didn't think it was about her and Juliet. He would have told her if that was the case.</p>
<p>After breakfast the family moved to the Sub Station. Alex couldn't completely hold back a groan when Justin pulled out the whiteboard and began to copy his notes to it. But keeping in mind that he was holding on to her secret she made an attempt to at least pretend to pay attention. But as he continued to write on the board she found herself drawn in by what he had found out. When he finished there was silence among the family, which included one daughter whose head was reeling with what she had just been told.</p>
<p>Justin looked at her sympathetically. Even as everyone started to talk Alex burst out.</p>
<p>"Juliet can't be a vampire!"</p>
<p>"Why not?" asked Max.</p>
<p>In one corner of her mind Alex knew that she was giving too much information away. But even as Justin put his finger on his lips to try to warn her she continued, determined to defend her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Because she's wonderful! She's sweet and lovely and I'm crazy about her. She just CAN'T be a vampire. Surely I would have sensed it somehow on our date last night."</p>
<p>Justin covered his ears and half-ducked as Alex realized she had lost control again. She saw everyone's mouth open and braced herself for what was about to come as everyone besides Justin spoke at once.</p>
<p>"You're dating the competition?" her father burst out.</p>
<p>"You're dating a vampire?" her Mother added.</p>
<p>"You're dating another girl?" Max finished breathlessly, his eyes shinning. Clearly his juvenile imagination was getting carried away in certain directions that his parents would prefer it did not, judging from the way their attention snapped over to him for an instant. Alex desperately wished it would stay there but after one pair of looks that promised Max a long talk the duo switched their gaze back to her again.</p>
<p>Her Father started to speak. Twice. Then he shook his head, took a deep breath and let it out.</p>
<p>"This is too serious for snap judgments. Alex, Your Mother and I have to talk about this and make a rational decision."</p>
<p>"What decision?" Alex struggled to get back to being the calm controlled person she had always prided herself on being.</p>
<p>"About if we are going to allow you to see Juliet again."</p>
<p>"Sweetie, its not that Juliet is a girl. That we could accept. But she's a vampire." her Mother pointed out.</p>
<p>As Alex tried to protest her Father held up his hand. "Later."</p>
<p>If Alex thought the day before had drug on forever it had been nothing as compared to this one. She was frightened. What if her parents told her she couldn't see Juliet? NO. That couldn't happen. Could it? The very thought made her heart stop. She didn't even dare try to call Juliet.</p>
<p>Her parents conferred several times. It was after the few remaining die-hard customers came for supper that they sat down with Alex and announced their decision.</p>
<p>"Alex, we have thought this through carefully. You're not going to like this." Alex's heart sank. "You can't see her again," her Father declared. "It's not right and it could be very dangerous."</p>
<p>"Exactly,' Her Mother nodded in support of her husband. "Vampires are not good people."</p>
<p>"That's not true! Juliet is a good person. I know it. And I'm in love with her!"</p>
<p>"You're blinded by love, Alex," her Dad said almost gently. "Or what you think is love. You're not seeing clearly. And it doesn't matter because I absolutely forbid you to date her."</p>
<p>"Daddy!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry but that's how it's going to be."</p>
<p>"This isn't fair! You're wrong."</p>
<p>"Alex, I understand you are upset but that's enough of that. I want you to go to your room and think this over. We'll talk again in the morning."</p>
<p>Alex flung herself on her bed, nearly in tears. She remained there for hours, ignoring the occasionally peek-ins by her parents to check on her. Once she was convinced they were satisfied she was obeying them she sprang into action. One quick spell and it appeared someone was sleeping in her bed under the covers. She unfastened the window, cast another spell and floated down to the ground. As soon as she touched down she slipped into the shadows and headed for where she hoped Juliet would be waiting for her. It would take more than banishment to her room to keep her from seeing her girlfriend.</p>
