<P><B>A/N: This is the final chapter for two reasons...<BR>- I have a lot of school stuff and will forget about it.<BR>- After all of my school stuff is over I don't think I will be into the story anymore, or be able to finish it.<BR>So yes, disappointing ending, but I just needed to end it now.</B></p>
<P>We stood outside of the room we had ran from a few minutes previous. I could see Miley fidgeting, and the look on her face and in her eyes was just pure fear. I didn't know what else to do, so I took her hand and gripped it tightly.</p>
<P>"It'll be fine, Miles," I tried, reassuring her with a sympathetic smile.</p>
<P>She managed one back, before I placed my spare hand on the door handle. I slowly pushed it open, and as I had predicted, every eye in the room draped on us.</p>
<P>No one spoke, and we just headed for our seats as I slowly let go of her hand. She sat, quickly and silently, and stared down at her desk. I sat moments later, not nearly as nervous as she had.</p>
<P>"So, you two are like...together?" a guy asked to my right. I think his name was Toby, but I'd never really stopped to ask. Not one of the people I would be associated with, he's more Amber and Ashley's type.</p>
<P>I shook my head, "No," I said simply, hoping to drop the conversation before it gets to Miley.</p>
<P>"Yeah right," he laughed, all of his jock friends in the class doing the same, a few of them punching eachother and giggling like little girls.</p>
<P>I just rolled my eyes, and faced the front again, where a rather perplexed Mr Corelli stood.</p>
<P>I felt bad for him, not the best last day he could've hoped for.</p>
<P>There were a few more comments, but me and Miley managed to shrug them off. I think it bothered her more than me, though, because what they were picking on her for was true.</p>
<P>"You alright?" I asked as I stood from my seat, having heard the bell ring.</p>
<P>She just nodded, not saying a word.</p>
<P>"Convincing," I laughed a little, trying to lighten the mood.</p>
<P>She just moved her bag over her shoulder, and looked to the door, signalling that she wanted me to hurry up so that we could just leave. The classroom was almost empty now, and we could finally escape home. I think she just needed to be away from everyone.</p>
<P>"Girls."</p>
<P>We both turned back to the front, where Mr Corelli stood. He signalled for us to come over, which we quickly did. He looked serious, which, when it comes to him, is out of the ordinary.</p>
<P>"What's up?" I ask, Miley trailing along behind me.</p>
<P>"I just wanted to say, that, I'm glad I got to see this before I left."</p>
<P>I laughed, "See what?"</p>
<P>"Look, I'm not as dumb as I seem. I know you two have liked eachother for a <I>long</I> time...actually, I don't think I've ever seen something so obvious."</p>
<P>I thought for a moment. What? Is that what people thought about our friendship?</p>
<P>"No...no, we're just friends," I corrected him with a nervous laugh.</p>
<P>He raised his eyebrows, "Whatever you say, Ms Truscott."</p>
<P>Miley lowered her head as I looked over to her.</p>
<P>I looked back to him, and he quickly grabbed some sheets of paper from his desk, "I'll just be a minute," he said, signalling to the door. It was clear that he had left us alone on purpose.</p>
<P>"Miles...do you think...I mean, did people think that?" I asked, a little nervously. I don't know why, really. I just thought we were being friendly, we had the normal friendship. We weren't <I>too</I> close...I don't think.</p>
<P>She shrugged.</p>
<P>I wish she would speak, it would make things so much easier.</p>
<P>"So you think they did?"</p>
<P>She shrugged again.</p>
<P>"Talk, Miles," I demanded in a stern voice.</p>
<P>She looked up to me now, "I don't know," she said weakly.</p>
<P>I sighed and leant back against the desk that stood at the front of the room. What to say next was a mystery to me.</p>
<P>"Did you not think to tell me? That I was being too close."</p>
<P>"You weren't being too close," she laughed a little, which was music to my ears...OK, I didn't say that!</p>
<P>"How do you know though, Miles. I mean, you like me, right?"</p>
<P>She nodded, dropping her head again. I guess it was harder for her to hear than it was for me to say.</p>
<P>"But how do you know that you definitely do? Is it just the same as it is with a guy?"</p>
<P>She shrugged, and looked back up at me slightly, still her head facing more to the floor, "I guess I don't know for sure...I just...do."</p>
<P>I gave her a confused look, which she laughed a little at, "See, I find that cute."</p>
<P>"I find your laugh cute," I said quickly, not thinking.</p>
<P>Her head shot up, a new look of seriousness carpeting it, "I mean...I <I>think</I> I think it's cute."</p>
<P>I closed my eyes and scrunched up my features at my last statement, why couldn't I speak?</p>
<P>"Kiss me."</p>
<P>I shot my head up, after looking down in embarrassment, and saw a serious Miley stood looking straight at me.</p>
<P>"What?" I said in a raspy voice.</p>
<P>"Kiss me."</p>
<P>I heard it the first time, but I just didn't believe it. Why would I kiss her? OK, I could ask the same question about why I had began taking steps towards her.</p>
<P>I slowly cupped her face, and leant forward rather slowly. It was...new. I want to say weird, strange...but it really wasn't. It was amazing, it made my spine shiver, made goosebumps flare up all over, it made me tingle.</p>
<P>I finally reached her lips, and all of the sensations from moments ago exploded into one. I could no longer group them, this was a whole new sensation.</p>
<P>A sensation I only got when I kissed Miley Stewart.</p>
<P>I slowly glided my lips over hers, as she put a hand onto mine, which was now on her hip. She slowly moved it upwards, towards my shoulder, trailing my whole arm with her fingertips and causing even more shivers to run through my body.</p>
<P>She reached my face, placing her hand on my cheek, as she deepened the kiss.</p>
<P>We didn't make it too long, we broke apart seconds later, but it still felt amazing.</p>
<P>"I um..." I began, as I cleared my throat, "I like that more than your laugh."</p>
<P>She laughed again, blushing, "And I like that more than your confused face."</p>
<P>We just looked at eachother, smiling like little school kids.</p>
<P>"We should kinda go," Miley laughed, standing back up fully after using a student's desk for support.</p>
<P>"Yeah."</p>
<P>I followed her to the door, but before we reached it I grabbed her wrist. Before she could speak I pulled her straight to me, and kissed her quickly.</p>
<P>It was one of those things, I can't explain it, but you just always want to feel that way. And when the one person that can do that to you is stood right beside you, it's hard not to take it and hold it tightly with everything you have.</p>
<P>"OK, show's over."</p>
<P>We both quickly pulled apart to see Mr Corelli pushing a crowd of people, mostly from our class, away from the door.</p>
<P>I hadn't noticed them, I must've been too caught up.</p>
<P>I laughed slightly, but Miley looked to the floor and blushed. I don't know if she thought that maybe I didn't want it to be known that I liked her...a lot. I reached over and took her hand, again, squeezing it tightly.</p>
<P>Her head shot up and she smiled her bright smile straight at me, and I tried my best to give her the feeling that her smile gave to me with one of my own.</p>
<P>I began walking, her quickly following suit.</p>
<P>We made our way through the door, and through the sea of people. We walked past Amber and Ashley, and I closed my eyes slightly, waiting for the insults to reign down on me. Yes, I wanted this, but no one said anything about it being easy. Nothing worthwhile ever is.</p>
<P>"<I>Finally</I>," I opened my eyes again, to see her talking to Ashley, "People can start to talk about <I>me</I> again," she said with a scoff, as she and her sidekick headed to another group of people behind us.</p>
<P>I turned back around, after watching her walk away, and smiled down at Miley.</p>
<P>I wrapped my arm over her shoulders, pulling her closer.</p>
<P>"Thanks for making me kiss you," I laughed, looking over at her.</p>
<P>She pecked me quickly on the lips, "Anytime."</p>
