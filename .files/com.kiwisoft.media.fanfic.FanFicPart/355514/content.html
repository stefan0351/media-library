<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 8 -->

<p>"Ms. ... Jessie's on the phone," said
Monica's voice over the intercom startling Katie out of whatever haze she had fallen
into. Clicking the caterer's menu off, she opened the link to the videophone.</p>

<p>"Hey," she said after a running a hand through
her hair. A moment later she realized she hadn't really needed to since the other
side of the screen remained blank, Jessie must have been on her cell phone.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie replied sounding rather distracted.
"I've been ... I mean I've got some information that you might like to
hear," she continued before Katie could say anything. "It's ..."
she said stopping to let out a weary sigh before continuing. "Listen, how do you feel
about lunch?"</p>

<p>"We're quite comfortable with each other, despite
what you may have heard," Katie replied trying not to sound as inordinately happy at
hearing the invitation as she was feeling. "What time?"</p>

<p>"How about the Mongolian House in half an hour,"
Jessie suggested shaking her head at Katie's first comment. The woman had always had
some comment she just had to make, it had amused her endlessly in high school, and it
apparently still did because she was smiling.</p>

<p>"I'll be there," Katie responded
immediately. "Drive safe."</p>

<p>"I always have," Jessie replied pointedly but
teasingly. "I'll see you in half an hour then. End."</p>

<p>Katie leaned back in her chair staring at the still empty
screen thoughtfully. She could swear that her palms were slightly damp, and her stomach
was most definitely tensing. But it was in a good way. It was a good tense and sweaty. It
was a Jessie tense and sweaty. She'd felt it when she gave Jessie that Billie Holiday
CD in the hallway and Jessie had turned to stare at her with happily surprised shining
eyes. She felt it when she told Jessie that she 'chose' her and took her hand
encouraging her to listen to the rain. She'd felt it that afternoon in the attic when
Jessie had whispered that she wanted to keep her letter forever. She'd felt it when
Jessie whispered 'can I?' that summer afternoon in her bedroom. She'd felt
it a million times with Jessie in the past and for the first time since they had broken up
she felt it again. And even though the more she thought about the more scared, anxious --
scanxious if you will -- and slightly sick she began to feel, she realized that she
wouldn't have had it any other way.</p>

<p align="center"><b>**********</b></p>

<p>"...so, basically even though I'm not supposed
to do this I'm going to guarantee you that we'll win," Jessie finished as
she picked up glass, her eyes flickering over to Katie. "Did you hear a word I just
said?" Jessie asked noticing the other woman's unfocused expression.</p>

<p>"You think the Yankees are going to win," Katie
replied crossing her mental fingers.</p>

<p>"That's most defiantly not what I said,"
Jessie replied leaning against the back of her chair and crossing her arms. "I'm
not repeating that whole conversation," she continued noting Katie's chastised
expression.</p>

<p>"Why don't you just give me the gist of it?"
Katie suggested trying not to smile at the position Jessie had taken up. She'd seen
Karen take up the exact same pose dozens of times in the past and she found it amazingly
charming that Jessie had unconsciously picked up the same mannerism.</p>

<p>"We're going to win," Jessie responded
rolling her eyes and leaning forward once more her hand grasping the fork that she'd
left resting in her bowl.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get that scar?" Katie asked her
attention focused on Jessie's hand. On the back of her right hand was a pale, half
moon shaped scar that she'd never seen before.</p>

<p>"What scar?" Jessie asked curiously, looking over
at Katie who merely nodded her head towards her hand. Jessie let go of her fork, and
turned her hand around so that she could see the whole thing, her eyes finally landing on
the mark in question. "Humph," she exhaled her left index finger migrating over
to her right hand to trace the line of the scar. "I..." she started to say
uncertainly, trying to track down the memory. "Oh yeah, I was helping Grace and Eli
move into their prize deathtrap, I mean 'fix her upper'," she continued
rolling her eyes in memory of the suburban spread the couple had bought. "My hand
caught on a nail that was sticking out of one of the walls."</p>

<p>Katie nodded, her eyes never leaving Jessie's.</p>

<p>"It's not really an interesting story,"
Jessie said a moment later, not really sure what to make of the fact that Katie had asked
her about a barely visible scar, let alone the fact that she actually seemed interested in
the answer.</p>

<p>"I think it is," Katie replied finally releasing
Jessie from her gaze, her hand picking up her napkin and playing with it distractedly.</p>

<p>"Why?" Jessie asked watching Katie's
movement and finding them oddly soothing.</p>

<p>"Because it's about you," Katie replied
quietly, but more than loudly enough for Jessie to clearly make her out.</p>

<p>"Oh," Jessie responded, her eyes dropping to the
tabletop.</p>

<p>"I've got a scar on my wrist," Katie said
resting her arm on the table and turning it around to the underside so that Jessie could
see. Just below where her thumb muscle there was a slight discolouration and crinkling of
her skin.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Jessie asked reigning in the
urge to reach over and trace Katie's scar as she had done with her own.</p>

<p>"Tar," Katie replied, smiling as Jessie looked up
at her questioningly. "I was working on a piece that I was using hot tar for, and
this mouse ran across the floor and scared the shit out of me. The ladle I'd been
holding kind of jerked up and tar went flying into the air, some landed on my wrist,"
she explained shaking her head. "It was strange, because I let it sit there for a
second before I tried to get it off of me. I remember just looking at it thinking that it
should hurt and wondering why it wasn't before the painful burning sensation set in
and I did my best imitation of a chicken with its head cut off."</p>

<p>Jessie smiled. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"No you're not," Katie replied returning the
smile. "You're thinking 'what an idiot, she got exactly what she
deserved'," Katie continued watching Jessie closely. "And you find the
mental image my description brought up highly amusing."</p>

<p>Jessie smile slowly faded at that, her expression turning
thoughtful. "Pretty much," she conceded considering Katie carefully. The other
woman was still able to read her like a book, and she knew from their previous meeting
that she was still able to read Katie pretty well herself. It seemed strange to her that
after all this time and as much as they had changed, that they should be able to still
know each other. "How'd you know?" Jessie asked a moment later.</p>

<p>"Same way I knew I could ask you if you felt like you
fit anywhere in the school," Katie responded her expression now reflective as well.
"I mean, it's pretty much always been like that between us hasn't it?"
she continued. Her statement may have been vague, but she knew that Jessie would know what
she was talking about. Ever since they had met they had seemed to just understand things
about the other, just knew how to interpret comments and gestures correctly, they were
just able to read what was in each other's eyes.</p>

<p>"Um...knowing," Jessie responded with a soft
smile.</p>

<p>"I, ah, have wanted to ask you something, for going on
twelve years now though," Katie said watching as Jessie looked over at her.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked curious about what Katie
could have possibly kept quiet about for twelve minutes let alone twelve years.
Self-restraint had never been her former-girlfriends claim to fame.</p>

<p>"Were you really surprised? When you read my
letter?" she asked, her eyes focused on her fidgeting hands. Jessie's reaction
to the letter had always confused her, especially considering what had happened later in
the attic, considering the fact that she had liked her back. She felt a connection with
Jessie instantly, as she had listened to her belt out that song on stage in the
auditorium, and while throughout the weeks there had been looks and touches that she could
have classified as meaning more, she had never wanted to because she hadn't thought
that she could have taken it if she was wrong, and Jessie had turned away from her. But
that day, when they had snuck out of school and escaped away to Jessie's bedroom, as
they lay there on the bed Katie had undeniably felt something, a two way something. And to
this day, she was certain that if Lily hadn't walked in on them she would've
kissed Jessie, and that Jessie would've let her. Which was why the blonde's
reaction to the letter had always confused her.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded shaking her head.
"Although I guess I shouldn't have been. I probably wouldn't have been in a
few more weeks if Grace had just kept her mouth shut but..."</p>

<p>"Grace?" Katie asked. "She read the
letter?" she continued thinking that she really should have folded it a couple more
times or something.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie said shaking her head. "She
... we were talking about the GSA and she was going on about how people she thought
should join probably wouldn't. Like your friend, Katie, she said," Jessie
continued shaking her head in embarrassment as she went along. "What, I demanded
stupidly, cause you see I was shocked. 'Well she's gay,' she responded like
I'd asked her to pass the salt. What, I demanded again. I was still shocked you
see," Jessie went on not daring to look over at Katie. "Anyway, to make a long
and embarrassing story short, I'd never considered the possibility. I mean I knew how
I felt about you was different, but I really never even thought about possibly,
hypothetically thinking about the possibility that it could be possible for me to maybe
having classified these feelings as somewhere in the vicinity of romantic."</p>

<p>"I see," Katie responded quietly.</p>

<p>"But the more I read your letter, the more it all
started to make sense," Jessie continued oblivious to Katie's quiet interjection
of support. "It's just ... you know I remain confident that if we'd had
a few more incidences like the time Lily caught us skipping, I would have figured it out.
But, yeah, I mean I was actually surprised by the letter. In a good way."</p>

<p>Katie smiled over at her, and then they lapsed into silence
for a moment before she finally spoke. "Do you like ballet?"</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked thinking to herself that she
had finally located where she had picked up the propensity to abruptly change topics with
no warning whatsoever.</p>

<p>"I've got tickets for Thursday night," Katie
started shifting in her seat. "That was my subtle way of asking if you wanted to
come. With me ... that is," she continued mentally rolling her eyes at her
stupidity. She'd asked dozens of women out on dates before and managed to remain
unflustered yet, now after a decade of practice she was getting all stutter-y about it.</p>

<p>"Are you asking me out on a date?" Jessie asked
looking over at the flustered other woman.</p>

<p>"Badly, but yes," Katie replied finally raising
her eyes up to look at Jessie.</p>

<p>"Who was the other ticket for?" Jessie asked once
Katie's eyes had met hers.</p>

<p>Katie blinked in surprise. She certainly hadn't been
expecting that one.</p>

<p>"They were a gallery warming gift," she said
finally. "I was thinking about putting an ad out for an escort, but then you came
along and I figured that I'd rather just pay for dinner," she continued wincing
internally as Jessie simply stared at her in response. Smooth, Singer, insinuate she
slightly better than a whore, that'll win her over. "I mean the other ticket
wasn't for anyone. I wasn't even going to go. But then of all the galleries, in
all the world you had to walk into mine and suddenly the ballet isn't looking so bad
if you're sitting next to me," she finished looking over at Jessie, her eyes
pleading for forgiveness.</p>

<p>Jessie sighed and turned her head away. "If you break
my heart I'll kill you," she said softly as she turned her head back around to
look at Katie.</p>

<p>"If I break your heart you won't have to,"
the other woman replied with the utmost seriousness.</p>

<p>"How does one dress for the ballet?" Jessie asked
breaking their gaze, feeling somewhat more at ease now that she had settled herself to the
idea of exploring whatever it was that there was between them even if it left it broken
and bitter with an irrational longing for more than three cats.</p>

<p>"Spiffily," Katie replied.</p>

<p>"Is that even a real word?" Jessie asked looking
over at her, a small smile appearing on her face.</p>

<p>"It is," Katie declared proudly. "I looked
it up."</p>

<p>"I can't believe I'm going to the ballet
with someone who looked 'spiffily' up in the dictionary," Jessie responded
shaking her head. Katie Singer, she thought to herself. God, she had missed this woman.</p>
