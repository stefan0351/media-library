<!-- Moment by Moment \ 7. Hormonal Overdrive -->

<p>I should be sleeping but my bunkmate apparently has other ideas.</p>
<p>Sometime around two, Sam slipped into my bed with me and her hands
have been somewhat?less than idle since she got here. I can feel her
breath against my face as she lays in her side next to me letting her
hand wander over my stomach, above my pajama top. Her breaths are
uneven and she knows I'm awake. My soft whimpers and squirming on
the bed would be a REALLY good indication of my state of wakefulness.
</p>
<p>Oh God. She just undid the bottom button of my top and I can feel
her fingertips grazing my abdomen. I can't help the rough gasp that
slips past my lips and I hear her breathing increase at the sound of
it. Her hand is so warm; I just want her to touch me everywhere and
be able to melt into her.</p>
<p>Now her hand is lying flat against my belly, its heat seeming to burn
my skin making me wonder if when it's gone, will I be branded with
her hand print? Not that I would mind if it did. My desire for her
is so great I feel tears leak down my face. To my complete surprise
and supreme joy, I feel her kiss them away.</p>
<p>"Sshh, Brooke, don't cry," she whispers into my ear making me
shiver. "I'm just curious but I'll stop if you want me to." She
almost sounds hurt.</p>
<p>Aww Sammy, no.</p>
<p>"No!" I gasp more forcefully than was necessary. Oops. "It's OK,
really." She smiles at me and then puts her face in the crook of my
neck, letting her breaths wash over my skin and tracing circles on my
abs.
</p>
<p>I cough, not to clear my throat but to keep from sounding too lustful
when I talk. I don't want her to think that I want something from
her that she's not ready to give. Never. I'd rather never have a
moment with her than ever have her think that about me.</p>
<p>"What are you curious about?" I still ended up sounding like a sex-starved sailor just arrived in port. She must have liked it though
because she shivered and snuggled closer.</p>
<p>Does she not think I've noticed that her hand has crept higher under
my shirt? She's dangerously close to my breasts. Yay.</p>
<p>"You." Her mouth is right beside my ear and her tongue darts out to
lick it. I tremble violently with want and whimper as my throat
closes slightly.
</p>
<p>"You're so soft," she continues lowly. Right now she could recite
the yellow pages and I'd be jelly in her hands. Speaking of which, I
hope I have some clean jammies cuz I don't think I'm going to be able
to sleep in these in their current state.</p>
<p>Sorry, overshare.</p>
<p>Gah. Her hand is caressing the underside of my left breast and I'm
in Heaven and in Hell. Everything I want and yet I want more. Damn
it.</p>
<p>"Here, I'll show you what I mean," Sam whispers and her hand leaves
my breast.
</p>
<p>Crying at the loss of contact would be foolish, right?</p>
<p>"Your hips," her hand follows the ridge of my pelvic bone as I lie
still on my back.
</p>
<p>Did I mention that now she's dangerously close to my pants and
underwear?</p>
<p>"Your hips are here," she points out and I nod. Trust me, speech is
not a possibility at this point. "I can feel the bone under here but
it's soft, curvy and lush. I like it."</p>
<p>And I like you touching it, Sammy.</p>
<p>"Your abdomen is muscular, strong. But you're relaxed, somewhat,"
she winks at me and then puts her head back to my neck. "So it's soft
and pillowy."</p>
<p>Uh huuuuuuuuh?</p>
<p>"Your ribs," her hand is wandering back up my stomach and I have
goose bumps as it glides across my skin. "Are under here but don't
jut out roughly. You're smooth, soft, warm?"</p>
<p>Her breathing has picked up again and her voice has dropped a few
octaves. She's aroused herself with her little explanation. Heh.
Me too. As if being further aroused was even possible but apparently
it is.</p>
<p>"Your breasts?"
</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>"Oh God," she echoes my thoughts as she cups the breast she abandoned
earlier. She clears her throat and I wonder if it's for the same
reason I did a little while back.</p>
<p>"Nicole?Nicole was none of those things, Brooke," her voice is still
rough with desire and makes me throb in places I shouldn't. "She was
rough and hard, cold and sharp. You're smooth and soft, warm and
curvy."</p>
<p>Kill me and put me out of my misery or please let me have an orgasm
before I burst into flames, someone?anyone? (Actually, just Sammy
but anyway)</p>
<p>She's pinching and teasing my nipple with her fingers and I want to
beg her to use her mouth but I can't speak. AT ALL. I feel her lean
even closer to my ear.</p>
<p>"And there's something I really need to tell you." She sounds
frightened. I wonder why.</p>
<p>"Uh huuuuuh," I manage to eke out at least that much as her hand
never stills.</p>
<p>"Please don't be mad but?the whole time I was with Nicole that night?after I'd said `yes'?I imagined it was you I was with. That it was
you kissing me, touching me, making me cum. Not her."</p>
<p>The orgasm floods through my body with the power of a freight train
and my upper body rises off the bed. I hear myself grunt loudly,
which I'm not prone to doing. I'm usually pretty quiet. Sam holds
me tightly as I convulse and pant.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she apologizes near tears.</p>
<p>"Oh God, don't be," I rasp out after my body calms down and I have a
margin of control over it again. Hmm, feels really nice to be
wrapped up in Sam's arms like this feeling the afterglow of a mind-blowing orgasm.
</p>
<p>Damn, and she barely touched me too. I'd probably shatter into a
million pieces if she actually did.</p>
<p>Oh goody. I hope so.</p>
<p>"It's just?I didn't mean for that to happen. I didn't realize you
were so?" she's cute when she babbles.</p>
<p>"Hot? Aroused?" I supply for her making her giggle slightly.
</p>
<p>Looky there, I can speak again.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she replies sheepishly. "Wow."</p>
<p>Understatement anyone?</p>
<p>"Yeah wow," I sigh. Now I'm tired. "Thank you." I kiss her gently
on the lips. After I pull away I can see in the dim light that she's
watching me carefully, probably trying to figure out what I'm going
to do next. I reach up and brush her hair out of her somewhat
haunted eyes.</p>
<p>I can see that she's not ready for anything more, not yet. The
wounds Nicole inflicted are still too raw, too fresh for Sam to give
herself completely over to someone else again right now.</p>
<p>That's OK, I can wait. Knowing that there's a chance makes it easier.</p>
<p>"I think it's time for sleep, huh, Sammy?" I ask and she nods. "OK,
but first I need to change my clothes."
</p>
<p>Oh, Sammy, that smirk should be a registered lethal weapon.</p>
<p>"Why?" she asks innocently as I slip out of the bed. Ha, I'm not
buying that innocent act with that leer going with it.</p>
<p>Oh my God, she's making me blush!</p>
<p>"Uhm, I'm a little bit?damp, Sam," I admit quietly.</p>
<p>"So am I," I hear her whisper and I have to grab the dresser
for support as a shudder shoots through me. My legs are rubber now,
nice job, Sam.</p>
<p>"You can?uh?go change if you want," I cough as I pull out new
pajamas and underwear.</p>
<p>"Nah," she says and shifts on the bed. "Do you want me to
roll over while you change?"</p>
<p>Heh. Why bother? Although it is sweet of her to ask.</p>
<p>"That's entirely up to you," I say. I don't hear the bed
move so I know she's watching. I strip off my shirt, baring my naked
chest to her. Her breath catches and reaches my ears as it hisses
past her lips. I smirk to myself and then strip out of my soaked
pants and underwear.</p>
<p>I'm as open and vulnerable to her gaze as I'm ever going to
get.</p>
<p>God, the hunger in her eyes is unmistakable. I never thought
I'd ever be the object of her obvious desire like that.
</p>
<p>"I don't suppose?" she swallows hard. "I don't suppose, if I
promise to behave, that you'd consider sleeping in the nude, would
you?" she asks. "I just want to hold you, Brooke. You're so damn
beautiful."</p>
<p>How can I say `no' to that?</p>
<p>Besides, it'll probably save me on laundry.</p>
