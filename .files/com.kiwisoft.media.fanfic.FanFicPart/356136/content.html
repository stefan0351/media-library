<!-- After Homecoming \ Part 5 -->

<p>Buffy avoided
nearly everyone the rest of the school week. Opting to weapon train with
Faith and Giles during lunch, and heading home early after patrol gave
Buffy plenty of time to think things over. Of course none of the thinking
helped. On Friday night Buffy did her sweep of the area, checking in on
Angel as well. Normally she would have stayed longer, but she was just
too restless to stay for more than half an hour.</p>

<p>Walking back
into town, she came within sight of the Bronze and debated going in to
see her friends. Deciding to go in, Buffy started to cross the street when
she saw Xander and Cordelia come out. Stopping, Buffy watched as they finished
what looked to be a fight between the two of them. Cordelia seemed to be
explaining something to Xander, to which he was not quite accepting. Cordelia
turned away from him, which made Xander stop and walk up close to her and
say something. Turning around, Cordelia put a hand on his arm and spoke
softly. After a minute, Cordelia walked towards her car and got in while
Xander went back into the Bronze.</p>

<p>From what Buffy
could tell, Cordelia was just sitting in the driver's seat, not making
any motion to start the car. Concerned, she walked over to the car and
tapped on the window.</p>

<p>Cordelia jumped
in her seat, clearly startled. Whipping her head around to see who it was,
Cordelia smiled slightly when she recognized Buffy. Motioning to the other
side of her car, Cordelia flipped the switch on the power locks as Buffy
walked around the car and climbed in.</p>

<p>"Are you alright
Cordy?" Buffy asked her friend gently.</p>

<p>Cordelia shrugged
her shoulders. "Yeah, of course. I take it you saw Xander and I just now.
That was nothing, he's just mad because I haven't exactly been in the best
of moods lately. I think I made him understand though. He went back inside
to hang out with Willow, Oz, and Faith."</p>

<p>"Faith's in there
too?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, said there
was nothing good on TV tonight or something."</p>

<p>"Cool." Buffy
said. "So how come you haven't been down with the happies lately? Something
happen?"</p>

<p>Cordelia pondered
for a moment. "I don't really know, actually. I just don't feel like doing
the usual stuff this week. Maybe I'm coming down with something... "</p>

<p>Buffy rested
her hand on her friend's arm. "Don't worry about it. It's probably nothing.
Lately I've been feeling restless too. It's probably just school and pressure
about next year that's getting us down. We'll get over it." Buffy said,
hardly believing her own words.</p>

<p>"Maybe." Cordelia
said reluctantly. "Where have you been for the past couple of days anyway?
I... kinda missed you."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled
at Cordelia. "I missed you too. I was training during lunch, and patrolling
a lot."</p>

<p>"But didn't you
say you weren't patrolling as late as usual? You didn't come with us to
the Bronze later on like you usually do. I was just kinda worried. Plus
you weren't in English or Chem class the last three days."</p>

<p>" I'm sorry.
I just couldn't deal with much this week. I'll make sure I'm there next
week, okay?" Buffy moved her hand down to grasp Cordelia's.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked
down at their hands. "Alright, that sounds good." She said, smiling. "Actually,
I think my mood has lightened already."</p>

<p>"Mine too." Buffy
agreed, grinning.</p>

<p>"Do you want
to come over tonight?" Cordelia asked. "We can watch some bad TV or something."</p>

<p>"Hm, I remember
the last time we decided to do that." Buffy grinned even wider. "Sure,
let's go."</p>

<p>Starting the
car, Cordelia drove off in the direction of her house, suddenly in a really
good mood.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Walking into
her house, Cordelia listened for a moment after she reset the alarm system.
"My parents are either out or in bed. Coolness."</p>

<p>"Definitely."
Buffy agreed as they went into the family room.</p>

<p>Cordelia turned
on the TV and handed the remote to Buffy. "Here, you decide what to watch."</p>

<p>Sitting down
on the couch, Buffy starting flipping through the channels. "So, how much
did I miss in English class?"</p>

<p>Cordelia thought
for a moment as she sat down next to Buffy. "A bit actually. We read this
story in the Lit text, and we've been in groups doing sheets with questions
on . em. They are all due next week."</p>

<p>"Am I in a group?"
Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're
in mine."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled.
"Cool."</p>

<p>"You should probably
read the story by Monday though."</p>

<p>"I'll get on
it tomorrow." Buffy promised. Tired of changing channels, she left it on
a rerun of . The X-Files'. "Have you ever watched this show?" she asked
Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Yeah, every
once in a while. It doesn't really do anything for me though, real life
seems to be scary enough already. This show has nothing on the hellmouth,
that's for sure."</p>

<p>"True." Buffy
agreed.</p>

<p>They watched
in comfortable silence for a while, neither of them really following the
plot of the episode. Bored with the show, Buffy looked down at her hands
in her lap and noticed just how close she was sitting to Cordelia. Reaching
over, Buffy picked up Cordelia's hand and slipped it into her own.</p>

<p>Startled, Cordelia
looked down at their hands, and then over at Buffy. A slow smile spread
on her face and she squeezed Buffy's hand lightly.</p>

<p>"So you're sure
you're alright now? Everything's cool between you and Xander, etc?" Buffy
asked softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, everything
is fine. Well, except for the part where he doesn't know that I'm sharing
smoochies with his ex crush." Cordelia said staring off into space.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I
mean, I'm sorry that he... well, it's not like he could know." Buffy
said sadly.</p>

<p>"I know. I don't
know what's going on anymore, with anything. I have feelings for him...
.and now I have feelings for you. And you have feelings for Scott...
"</p>

<p>"No, I don't
have feelings for Scott." Buffy interrupted. "We didn't have enough time
to develop any kind of relationship before he dumped me."</p>

<p>"Sorry."</p>

<p>"Nah, it's alright.
I don't even know why I went after Scott in the first place." Buffy said,
then changed her mind, "No, I do know why. I was lonely. But then things
kept coming up, and everything was wrecked between us. He couldn't deal
with the stuff I am going though obviously. Then again, who blames him?
He doesn't know I'm a Slayer or anything, so he must have figured I was
purposely avoiding him." Buffy rambled.</p>

<p>"You're lonely?"
Cordelia asked softly.</p>

<p>Turning to look
at Cordelia, Buffy frowned sadly. "I... guess I miss having someone to...
I don't know, comfort me? Listen to my problems? That's why Scott would
have never lasted longer than he did. He doesn't know me as I really am."</p>

<p>"I do." Cordelia
said seriously.</p>

<p>Buffy stared
at Cordelia for a moment, then smiled shyly. "Yeah, I guess you do. You
know me, and know how to pretty much deal with what I am."</p>

<p>"Of course I
seem to keep showing you otherwise. I'm really sorry for saying what I
did when we were stuck at that cabin last Friday." Cordelia apologized.
"You've been saving my ass for over a year now, and I still forget to be
grateful."</p>

<p>"It's fine, Cordy.
Really." Buffy assured her, "Besides, Friday seems like a really long time
ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," Cordelia
agreed, "And things have changed. I don't think I could ever say or do
those hurtful things to you ever again." She looked down into her lap.
"I care about you."</p>

<p>Leaning over,
Buffy kissed Cordelia gently. "I care about you too. Hell, I can't stop
thinking about you."</p>

<p>"Then why did
you disappear for almost three days?" Cordelia asked. "I mean the real
reason though, it couldn't have been all about slaying."</p>

<p>Buffy sighed.
"I was confused. I am confused... about what we've started, and if it'll
develop further... and how I feel a little guilty, because the only person
I've ever really pictured myself with is Angel." Buffy paused. "But then
I also feel restless because of what you and I have discovered between
us, and I really want to find out how great it could be to be involved
with you." She looked at Cordelia and smirked. "I know, I sound stupid."</p>

<p>"You think we
could start a relationship?" Cordelia asked, lightly brushing the length
of Buffy's thigh with the fingertips of her free hand.</p>

<p>"Actually I think
we've already started one." Buffy breathed. "I'm just curious as to see
when we'll develop it further."</p>

<p>"Hm, that makes
both of us." Cordelia agreed as she moved to capture Buffy's lips with
her own.</p>

<p>Releasing Cordelia's
hand, Buffy gently reached up and cupped Cordelia's face, deepening the
kiss. The pressure made Cordelia lean back slightly to brace herself, so
to accommodate Buffy raised herself to her knees, now able to continue
her assault.</p>

<p>Deciding to take
the extra step, Cordelia opened her mouth slightly and grazed her tongue
over Buffy's lips, seeking access into the other girl's mouth. Buffy willingly
parted her lips, moaning into Cordelia's mouth as their tongues touched
for the first time. Hands wandering, Buffy lowered hers to trail down Cordelia's
back and up her sides, hesitant to go further, though hardly being able
to control herself. Cordelia untangled her hands from Buffy's hair and
moved to cover the wandering ones as they made another pass on her sides.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid."
Cordelia whispered against Buffy's mouth. "If you want to, then I want
you to." Releasing Buffy's hands, she softly ran her hands over the other
girl's breasts on route back to their spot in her hair.</p>

<p>Buffy gasped
in surprise. Returning the favour, she brought her hands up to carefully
cup Cordelia's breasts. Feeling the girl's breath catch suddenly, Buffy
smiled as she kissed her again, squeezing slightly with her hands. This
time Cordelia moaned, which pleased her to no end. Moving her hands down,
she felt the hem of Cordelia's shirt. Deciding she needed to feel skin
under her fingertips, Buffy slowly slid her hands up under the fabric,
all the while keeping her balance on shaky knees. Reaching the silk of
Cordelia's bra, Buffy slipped her hands around back for the clasp, struggling
for a moment to get it to release.</p>

<p>The sound of
the front door opening and the alarm beeping nearly caused the two girls
to freeze instantly.</p>

<p>"It's my parents."
Cordelia whispered, as she straightened her shirt and turned back to face
the TV.</p>

<p>Buffy sat back
also, putting a proper amount of space between them. Wiping her mouth,
she attempted to calm her breathing as Cordelia's mother walked into the
room.</p>

<p>"Cordelia, you're
home. And you brought a friend over." Cordelia's mother said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Mom, dad, this
is Buffy. She's a friend from school. We were just watching TV tonight,
since the Bronze wasn't too exciting." Cordelia explained.</p>

<p>"Well Buffy,
it's nice to meet you. I hope you two girls have fun. Goodnight, we're
heading off to bed." Cordelia's mother greeted, then left the room with
her husband.</p>

<p>"I should be
going." Buffy said suddenly. "It's already 11:30pm."</p>

<p>"Alright." Cordelia
sighed.</p>

<p>Buffy reached
over and touched Cordelia's cheek. "Hey, you know I have to go. I would
stay longer if I could."</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled.
"Yeah, I know."</p>

<p>"Drive me home?"
Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Buffy lay in
bed that night thinking of all that had happened that evening. She no longer
felt restless and guilty, and she no longer felt confused. Sleep came easy
to her that night.</p>
