<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER FOUR</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">GROWING UP</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">- Three Years Later -</p>
<p>It was Christmas time in Pine Ridge, and the small Tennessee town was truly in a festive mood. Flashing white lights and evergreen garlands were everywhere. As always, a huge Christmas tree stood in the center of the town square, cut from the mountains just a few days before. A large white banner hung above Main Street, announcing the arrival of Santa Claus at City Hall and the upcoming annual Candlelight Procession.</p>
<p>Among the hustle and bustle of the townsfolk going about their holiday business, twelve year old Miley Ray Stewart and her mother Susan were out doing their Christmas shopping. For Miley, most of her list was already done - she already had presents for both of her parents, her older brother Jackson and her Grandma Ruthie (Miley had always called her 'Mamaw') – and now she was desperately trying to find the perfect gift for her best friend, Lilly Truscott.</p>
<p>In the three years since they had first met, Miley and Lilly had already grown very close. In fact, they had become nearly inseparable. The two best friends were rarely, if ever, apart and seemed to like it that way. They did everything together, and those who knew them best could tell they weren't quite the same when they <i>weren't</i> together. Fortunately, those instances seemed to be few and far between… like now.</p>
<p>"What do you think I should get for Lilly, momma?" Miley asked her mother. They were walking together through Woolworth's department store, the biggest store in Pine Ridge, doing their Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>"It's gotta be special," Miley insisted. "Just like Lilly." Susan Stewart smiled. She never ceased to be amazed, and touched, by the obviously special relationship between her daughter and her best friend.</p>
<p>"I'm sure we can find something for her, Miley," she told her daughter simply.</p>
<p>"I hope so," Miley replied, sounding doubtful. Susan grinned.</p>
<p>"Did you already have something in mind for her?" she asked Miley.</p>
<p>"Not really," Miley replied. "It just has to be…"</p>
<p>"Special," Susan finished for her, laughing a little. "I know, Miley; we'll find something nice for her, you'll see." Mother and daughter turned a corner into the store's small jewelry department</p>
<p>"Maybe you can find something for Lilly here," Susan suggested. Miley walked over to one of the display cases and peered inside. All manner of bracelets, watches, rings and necklaces filled the case, but none seemed to catch Miley's eyes. Then, in a corner of the cabinet, she saw it: a pair of necklaces with matching golden charms, in the shape of a heart in two pieces. The words 'Forever Friends' were etched on the separated heart.</p>
<p>"Momma, look at this!" Miley called out excitedly. Susan walked over to see what her daughter was pointing at.</p>
<p>"That's beautiful, Miley," Susan said in appreciation. "Do you think Lilly would like that?" Miley nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"I really wanna get it for her, momma, can I?" she asked excitedly.</p>
<p>"Well, how much is it?" Susan asked. She paused to look at the price tag set in front of the two necklaces. It was slightly more than she really wanted to pay, but she knew how badly her daughter wanted it, and she just couldn't refuse the pleading look on Miley's face.</p>
<p>"All right, baby girl; if it means that much to you, we can get it." Miley practically launched herself into a hug with her beloved mother.</p>
<p>"Thank you, momma! I love you so much!" she gushed. Susan just smiled.</p>
<p>"You're welcome, Miley," she said warmly, "but you might have to do a few extra chores to earn it." Miley grimaced.</p>
<p>"All right, momma… if I have to."</p>
<p>"What, no complaining?" Susan teased her. Miley just shrugged.</p>
<p>"Lilly's worth it," she answered. Susan couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"You really do care for her, don't you baby girl?" she asked her only daughter softly. Miley felt herself blush.</p>
<p>"She's my best friend, momma," she said simply.</p>
<p>"I know she is, Miley… and she's lucky to have a best friend like you," Susan replied, smiling again. She gave her daughter a gentle kiss on the top of her head.</p>
<p>"Now let's buy your best friend her very special Christmas present."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Christmas Eve was just two days later, when the annual Candlelight Procession down Main Street to the First Presbyterian Church would take place. Miley had also invited Lilly over for the evening so they could exchange their Christmas presents. She was already excited to see what Lilly's reaction to her special present would be.</p>
<p>"Miley, if you don't stop pacin' in front of the door like that, you're gonna wear a hole in the floor!" Robbie Ray teased his daughter. He watched her out of the corner of his eye and he placed an armful of presents underneath the Stewart family Christmas tree, in their living room.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry daddy," Miley replied. "I'm just really excited to give Lilly her present!"</p>
<p>"You don't say," Robbie Ray quipped. He saw Miley glare at him out of the corner of her eye, and he laughed.</p>
<p>"I'm just givin' you a hard time, bud," he apologized. "Lilly's gonna love her present, don't worry."</p>
<p>"You really think so, daddy?" Miley asked him uncertainly.</p>
<p>"Of course she will, bud… 'cause it comes from your heart." Miley blushed politely.</p>
<p>"Thank you, daddy," she whispered. At that moment the front doorbell rang, and Miley almost jumped out of her skin.</p>
<p>"I think your company's here, bud," Robbie Ray said with a laugh. Miley quickly answered the door, trying her best to swallow her excitement.</p>
<p>"Hey, Smiley!" Lilly Truscott greeted her best friend as she walked inside. She and Miley shared a quick hug.</p>
<p>Time had in fact changed the two best friends very little, but there was no disguising how much they had already grown up. Lilly had grown quite a bit taller, though Miley was taller still. Playing sports had given her a trim athlete's figure. She was still as much a tomboy as ever, preferring large t-shirts and a pair of jeans to wearing anything remotely 'girly'. At the moment, she was wearing a blue and white Tennessee Titans jersey and a pair of dark blue jeans.</p>
<p>Miley had, as her father put it, sprouted like a weed. She was a good couple of inches taller than Lilly, but she lacked Lilly's athletic physique. Nevertheless, she was as pretty as ever, and her infectious smile hadn't gone anywhere. She was wearing blue jeans as well, along with a red, white and green Christmas sweater.</p>
<p>"Hey, Mr. S," Lilly called out to Robbie Ray, giving him a small, friendly wave.</p>
<p>"Hey there, Lilly,' Robbie Ray replied with a smile. "Where's your mom tonight?"</p>
<p>"Oh, she had some last-minute shopping to do," Lilly answered. "She said she'd meet us at the Candlelight Procession. Can I ride there with you guys later?"</p>
<p>"Sure you can, Lilly," Robbie Ray responded. "Not a problem at all."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mr. S!" Lilly said with a grin.</p>
<p>"Okay, time to open our presents!" Miley said excitedly. Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"Why so anxious, Smiley?" she teased her best friend, still using the nickname she had created for Miley when they first met. "Can't wait to see what your fabulous best friend got you for Christmas?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I want you to see what <i>I</i> got you," Miley admitted. "I really hope you like it."</p>
<p>"If it's from you, I know I will," Lilly said earnestly. Miley led her over to her family's Christmas tree and quickly pulled out a small box wrapped in shiny red paper with a huge green bow on top of it. A gift tag in the shape of a big smiley face also adorned it.</p>
<p>"Guess I know who it's from now," Lilly quipped, smiling. Miley reverently handed her the box. Lilly, in turn, handed Miley a small gift bag with a smiling snowman on the front.</p>
<p>"Open yours first," Miley insisted. Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"All right," she replied, "but only 'cause you asked so nicely!" She had the wrapping paper off and the box open in the space of just a few seconds. Underneath the tissue paper inside she found an even smaller box.</p>
<p>"I really hope there's not another box inside this one," Lilly laughed. She drew in a sharp breath when she opened the smaller box and saw what was inside.</p>
<p>"Miley…is this…?" She carefully lifted the golden necklace of its box, silently admiring the half heart-shaped charm dangling from the end.</p>
<p>"I, um… I have the other half," Miley announced. She gently pulled the necklace she was already wearing from its hiding place in her sweater and showed it to Lilly.</p>
<p>"See?" she said, holding her half of the golden heart against Lilly's, re-forming the words "Forever Friends" etched on it. "Just like us, Lilly… we'll always be a part of each other." She waited nervously for Lilly to say something.</p>
<p>"Oh Miley, it's beautiful!" Lilly gasped, tears in her eyes. She slipped the necklace over her head and then pulled Miley into a fierce hug. "I love you, Smiley!"</p>
<p>"I-I love you too, Lilly," Miley whispered, wrapping her arms around her best friend. She had been momentarily taken aback by Lilly's sudden admission, but now, holding her best friend in her arms, Miley knew she truly loved Lilly as well. After a long moment, Lilly pulled back, gently wiping the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>"Now how is my gift supposed to top that?" she asked with a laugh.</p>
<p>"It's not a contest, Silly," Miley laughed with her. She picked up the gift bag Lilly had given her and reached carefully into it. Inside was a small picture of Miley and Lilly on horseback together, taken last summer by Miley's mother. The grinned happily into the camera, their hands joined. Lilly had placed the picture in a small pewter frame engraved with a single word: 'Friends'.</p>
<p>"Aw Lilly, it's wonderful! I love it!" Miley gushed. Lilly blushed slightly.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you like it, Miley," she said softly. "I have one just like it my room." Smiling, Miley pulled Lilly into another hug.</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas, Lilly," she whispered happily to her best friend.</p>
<p>"Merry Christmas, Smiley," Lilly whispered back to her.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>In another part of the Stewart home, Susan Stewart was busy baking a few last minute batches of Christmas cookies to give to some of her friends after the Candlelight Procession. She had heard just enough of the girls' exchange to know how much they had loved each others' presents, and it made her smile.</p>
<p>"I told you she'd like it, Miley," she said happily as she reached into the oven to remove some more cookies. At that moment, a searing pain flashed through her head and she dropped to her knees, the cookie sheet clattering from her hands. The loud sound attracted the attention of the others, and Robbie Ray rushed into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Susie, baby, are you okay?" he called out. She nodded weakly.</p>
<p>"Y-yes," she managed. "Just… made a mess, it looks like." Robbie Ray frowned.</p>
<p>"You're still having those headaches, aren't you?" he asked carefully, concern in his voice, as he helped his wife to her feet.</p>
<p>"It's fine, Rob, really," Susan insisted. "They're just headaches."</p>
<p>"No, they're not," Robbie Ray argued. "Susie, they're gettin' worse…you need to go see a doctor." Susan shook her head defiantly.</p>
<p>"Robbie Ray Stewart, I do <i>not</i> need to see a doctor! I'm just prone to headaches is all, and they always go away!" She swallowed and immediately lowered her voice.</p>
<p>"I don't wanna worry the children, Rob. Please… let it go…" she pleaded with him. Robbie Ray sighed.</p>
<p>"All right, Susie… for now." Miley, Lilly and Jackson ran into the kitchen just then.</p>
<p>"Momma, are you all right?" Miley exclaimed, rushing over to her mother's side.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, baby girl; I just slipped." She shared a brief look with her husband.</p>
<p>"We better get goin' then," Jackson pointed out. "The procession starts soon." Susan nodded.</p>
<p>"You're right, son," she answered. "Let me just clean up this mess first."</p>
<p>"We'll help you, momma," Miley offered.</p>
<p>"Sure Mrs. S," Lilly added. "We'll have it cleaned up in no time!" Susan Stewart just smiled.</p>
<p>"Thank you, girls. I don't know what I'd do without you."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Almost everybody in Pine Ridge showed up for the yearly Christmas Eve Candlelight Procession, meeting as always at the Children's Shelter at the edge of town. Everyone would then walk together back to the First Presbyterian Church, passing through the center of town as they did so.</p>
<p>"I'd like to thank everyone for showing up," Father Brown, the church pastor, greeted everyone warmly. "I'm glad we can all come together to celebrate this wonderful time of year as a community. If you'll all take and light a candle, we can get started." Everyone did so, and soon the procession began winding its way slowly back through town. As they walked, the people of Pine Ridge began to sing, and soon the chill night air was filled with the gentle sound of dozens of voices joined in song.</p>
<p>"You sing pretty good, Smiley," Lilly whispered to her best friend. Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"You're not so bad either, Silly," she replied. Lilly made a face.</p>
<p>"You just can't hear me over everyone else," she quipped. "Trust me, my so-called singing is painful!" Miley laughed softly.</p>
<p>"Tell you what – how about we sing together?" she suggested.</p>
<p>"All right," Lilly said with a smile. "Don't say I didn't warn you, though!" The two best friends joined their free hands – those not already holding their candles – and began to softly sing together…</p>
