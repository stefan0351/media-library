<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Two: Consequences -->

<P>B’Elanna Torres suffered the least during her punishment. She spent three
weeks in the Brig reading technical manuals and Klingon history. She actually
enjoyed the time she spent alone. The rest of the crew struggled during her
absence. Most notably was Seven of Nine. With Torres out of Engineering, Vorik
had first been put in charge, but after the warp core decided to throw several
temper tantrums, Janeway put Seven in charge of the Engine room. The engines
were running at peak efficiency, but the Engineering staff didn’t seem to enjoy
being giving Borg designations. </P>
<P>Seven looked up from the personnel reports when she heard the doors to
Engineering hiss open. She sighed and focused on the data padd on her desk as
Captain Janeway made her way across the room to the small office off to one
side.</P>
<P>"Seven, can I have a word with you?" Janeway asked from the doorway.</P>
<P>"Of course, Captain." Seven stood and gave Janeway her full attention.</P>
<P>"Would you care to explain this?" Janeway thrust a data padd at the former
Borg drone.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, then read over the padd. "Captain?"</P>
<P>"Explain." Janeway’s voice could have cut through the duranium deck plating.
She took a deep breath and slowly released it.</P>
<P>"I am uncertain as to what you expect me to explain," Seven said as she
handed the padd back to Janeway.</P>
<P>"What the hell were you doing?"</P>
<P>Seven seemed genuinely confused. "I was utilizing the holodeck to relieve
tension."</P>
<P>"This is not an acceptable use of the holodeck," Janeway said quietly. "In
fact, I think you should talk to the Doctor or perhaps Chakotay about this."</P>
<P>"Is this why Lieutenant Torres was imprisoned?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"No," Janeway snapped. "She is in brig because she injured several members of
this crew. I’m here because I am worried about you, Seven." </P>
<P>"Are you certain you are not here out of concern for the holocharacter? I did
reset the program when I left."</P>
<P>"Seven, you killed a holocharacter, twice. What is this about?" Janeway
stepped closer, but Seven moved away.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres killed a holocharacter, and from what Tuvok has said, it
was an efficient focus for her aggression," Seven explained. "He stated that had
B’Elanna not killed Becca, she would have severely injured Ensign Paris. Tuvok
stated that had the holodeck been full of holographic characters and not actual
crewmembers, Lieutenant Torres would not be in custody at this time." </P>
<P>"That doesn’t explain why you did this," Janeway said waving the padd.</P>
<P>"The character annoyed me," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"You broke his neck."</P>
<P>"Twice," Seven amended. "He is an exceptionally annoying program. He grabbed
my buttocks."</P>
<P>"So you killed him?"</P>
<P>"Captain, I am confused as to your objection. How is my use of the holodeck,
or Lieutenant Torres’ any different than yours?"</P>
<P>"What?" Janeway’s eyes widened.</P>
<P>"I killed the annoying bartender, Sullivan," Seven said as she went behind
her desk, or rather the desk she was using until Torres was returned to duty.
"It alleviated some of my tension. B’Elanna and I chose to kill holograms, you
choose to fuck them, both relieve tension. I fail to see why we are having this
discussion."</P>
<P>"You are out of line," Janeway said. Inside she cringed at the blonde’s
terminology. She hadn’t expected such a word from the exdrone’s mouth. </P>
<P>"Then perhaps you should send me to the brig," Seven replied. She knew her
words hurt the captain, she could tell by the tiny wrinkles that formed around
the older woman’s eyes when she looked at Seven, but she couldn’t stop herself
from saying them.</P>
<P>"Don’t think I won’t," Janeway said, her voice was harder than she had
intended, but Seven’s word had stung deeply. </P>
<P>"Are we finished?" Seven asked. "We are in need of dilithium crystals and I
need to assign a crew to retrieve them."</P>
<P>"Seven, what’s going on with you?" Janeway asked sincerely, pushing aside her
own hurt and focusing on her concern for Seven. "You’ve been avoiding me. You
don’t meet me for Velocity anymore; you won’t even look me in the eyes. Talk to
me. What is it?"</P>
<P>Seven briefly considered telling Janeway the truth, that she was deeply hurt
by the captain’s decision to turn to a hologram, but she couldn’t. It was too
painful to say out loud, so she changed the subject. "The dilithium crystals are
critical. I have found a planet three days away by shuttle."</P>
<P>"You’re avoiding my questions."</P>
<P>"I will pilot the shuttle myself," Seven stated.</P>
<P>"Seven, don’t you think leaving the ship to avoid my question is a little
over the top?" Janeway took a step closer to Seven as she spoke, but was only
frustrated when the Borg moved around her and headed out the door.</P>
<P>"I do not see how my actions can be seen in any spatial placement, over the
top or otherwise. I will be in the shuttle bay preparing for launch."</P>
<P>"Who are you taking with you?" Janeway asked, trying a different tact.</P>
<P>"I will go alone," Seven said dismissing the question.</P>
<P>"I don’t think so," Janeway said. "Protocol requires at least two
crewmembers," she added with a wry grin. She was hatching a plot, and not one of
her kinder ones.</P>
<P>"Fine," Seven said. "I will leave Vorik in charge and take Lieutenant
Nicoletti with me."</P>
<P>"No," the captain said.</P>
<P>"I am acting head of Engineering. I have the right to assign my staff as I
see fit," Seven said indignantly.</P>
<P>"And I am the Captain. I have the right to assign <I>my</I> crew any way I
see fit." The petite redhead crossed her arms over her chest and eyed the tall
blonde. "I think Lieutenant Torres has been in brig long enough, but I don’t
think her punishment is quite finished. I think a little dilithium collection
would be just the thing for her." Janeway almost laughed as she saw anger flash
across Seven’s sculpted features. It was no secret that Torres and Seven had a
volatile and unfriendly relationship, and both women generally did anything to
avoid spending time alone together. An away mission that required three days
travel each way in addition to the actual time it took to collect the dilithium
would be enough to bring the two to blows. "Sure you want to go yourself?"
Janeway challenged.</P>
<P>Seven stared at Janeway’s lips; they were edging up at the corners the way
they always did when she found something amusing. The exdrone suddenly pictured
that same smile directed at the hologram Sullivan. "I am sure Lieutenant Torres
and I will manage."</P>
