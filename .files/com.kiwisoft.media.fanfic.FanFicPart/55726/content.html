<!-- Chased the Dream \ Part Two -->

<p>Okay so it's been a week. Well actually it's been two weeks. Two very
long horrendous weeks of having to hear a blow for blow account of
how Helena and Reese's relationship has progressed. I've even been
able to see the progression on a few occasions. I'm happy for Helena.
I'm happy for Helena. I'm her friend and kind of like a younger
sister to her because we share sisterly love so I'm happy for her.
I'm happy for her. I'm happy for her.</p>
<p>I just figure if I repeat it enough then maybe I'll believe it. I
should probably change my mantra from 'I'm happy for her'
to 'Jealousy doesn't accomplish anything'. I'm not jealous of Reese
though. Why would I be? What do I have to be jealous of? Can the man
even add two and two together?</p>
<p>Okay that's not very nice. Detective Jesse Reese is an intelligent
man. He carries such attributes as actually caring about his job and
being concerned for the well-being of Helena, and even sometimes I
think he actually cares about me too. We haven't established any real
friendly repore but that's because I believe in a professional
distance. If I get too close I may actually throw the man into a
wall. So on the whole, keeping distance between us is a good thing.</p>
<p>Nothing serious has happened between them yet. At least I don't think
anything has. I'm kind of sure...well semi-positive that Helena would
tell me if seriousness has ensued. I get the feeling that she's
opening up to him more but she's still hiding away a lot of stuff.
She keeps a part of herself locked away and she only really shows it
to Barbara and sometimes she even shows it to me. She's talked to me
more now. And I'm not just talking about those surface conversations
about fighting and the big bad evil of the city, but we actually
talk. She's talked about her mom and I've talked about my mom.</p>
<p>I bet she hasn't talked to Reese about her mom. I bet he doesn't even
know the first thing of why Helena became Huntress. Yeah that's
right. He doesn't know anything and I do. I wonder what he'd have to
say about that. Mr. 'I'm the best detective in all of New Gotham come
look at how much of a pretty boy I am' Reese. I did say that jealousy
was bad didn't I?</p>
<p>Okay so I need to concentrate now. I'm supposed to meet up with
Huntress and we're supposed to stop some robbery of some bank because
that's what we do. Detective Reese is going to be coming as well but
that's after we stop the robbers first.</p>
<p>"Hey," Huntress says from behind me. I jump slightly because I didn't
hear her coming. It's easy to get snuck up on when you're not paying
attention. I'm here to play the superhero. I'm here to play the
superhero. Oh hey look, I've developed a new mantra.</p>
<p>"Hi. What took you so long?"</p>
<p>"I had to set things up with Jesse."</p>
<p>Oh it's Jesse now is it? We've graduated from Reese to Jesse. Well
isn't that nice. It's fantastic even. Yes, it's nice and fantastic.
Here to be a superhero. Here to be a superhero. Here to be a
superhero.</p>
<p>"So what's going on?"</p>
<p>What's going on she asks? What's going on? Well firstly I'm about to
start yelling for no other reason except for the fact she called
Reese Jesse. Well that actually covers the first, second, third, and
fourth things of what's going on.</p>
<p>"Four guys are inside the bank. From what Oracle can tell one is
definitely meta. He melted the door to the safe so that they could
get inside."</p>
<p>Huntress nods her head and I can just tell by her stance that it's
playtime for her now. She loves this. Hell, I love this. The
adrenaline is flowing through me quite nicely now and I have a good
high going on.</p>
<p>"Oracle Huntress is here now," I speak to our leader.</p>
<p>"Finally, what took you so long? I thought Canary might have to take
these guys on her own." Ooh someone's in trouble. Wait? Does she
think I can't take these guys on my own, because I so could.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. Let's just get this show on the road."</p>
<p>Oracle sighs heavily. "Fine." She then proceeds to tell us everything
she knows about what's happening inside the bank. Once she's finished
Huntress looks at me and I nod. We're ready to go take care of the
current situation.</p>
<p>We enter the bank through the same entrance the man that can melt
metal entered. Each of the guys has a huge bag of cash in their arms.
When they finally spot Huntress and I they stop confused. They're
perfect scheme apparently as perfect as they once thought.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" One of them asks.</p>
<p>"What does it really matter?" I ask. "We're obviously not here to
help you carry the money out of here. We are blocking your exit."</p>
<p>The man looks at me confused then turns his attention to Huntress.
She only shrugs then rushes him and hits him in the jaw. He quickly
recovers and they're going on round two. I throw one of the men
against a desk and take my chances with the metal melter. I'm able to
handle him surprisingly well until he gets a chance to touch my skin
and burns my hand.</p>
<p>Pain shoots through my entire body and I know I must have screamed
louder than I ever have before. I don't like getting burned. There
are some bad memories there. I recover as quickly as possible, which
isn't quick enough because I see metal melter man coming reaching for
my bare skin again. I roll away from him and then hear a gunshot.</p>
<p>Detective Reese is standing in the doorway and guy number four, who I
wasn't really concerned about is lying on the ground bleeding. It
doesn't really take me too long to realize that he had a gun in his
hand and he had been facing my direction. Well, so now I owe Reese my
gratitude for possibly, maybe, saving my life. I'd have to tell him
my thanks later. Metal melting guy had only hesitated as long as I
did when the gunshot occurred.</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet and since I was kind of tired of getting burned I
gathered all the energy I had left and concentrated on throwing
energy at the man to get him away. To my utter amazement it worked. I
looked down at my hands expecting to find some weird something coming
from them but they appeared perfectly normal except for the burn
marks.</p>
<p>I turned my attention then to Helena who was quickly approaching me.
She grabbed my hands in hers and started telling me that I was okay.
Something that I kind of already figured out.</p>
<p>"You need to get Oracle to take a look at those."</p>
<p>That was something that I knew too because they hurt like hell. I was
a superhero though so I had to make sure everything was okay. I
looked around and everything looked fine. All four robbers were in
some state of pain and unconciousness which was a positive thing.
Huntress and Canary had saved the day once again and New Gotham was
safe. Now seemed like a good time to pass out.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>When I woke up the first thing I noticed was that my hands had been
bandaged. Actually, that was the second thing I noticed. The first
thing I noticed was that someone was holding my hand that had been
bandaged. I turned my head and was facing the very concerned face of
one Helena Kyle. I also had this quite painful uh...pain in my side. I
wasn't quite too sure that had happened. I hadn't felt that before.</p>
<p>"What happened?" I asked trying to sit up, but Helena pushed me back
down.</p>
<p>"You need to rest."</p>
<p>"Okay. But what happened? I don't remember all that much. We stopped
the bad guys then I'm here."</p>
<p>"You were shot."</p>
<p>"What?" I jumped too quickly for Helena to stop me this time. "I
don't remember getting shot. Where was I shot?" I started to turn in
the bed and was then once more made aware of the pain in my side. My
guess was that I was shot in the side. When though? "I only heard one
gunshot."</p>
<p>"That's because the guy wasn't able to make another one. I stopped
him before he could."</p>
<p>"Reese was there?"</p>
<p>"He didn't pull his gun quick enough."</p>
<p>"So I was shot?"</p>
<p>Helena nodded.</p>
<p>Wow. Shot. I had been shot. That's never really happened to me
before. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would.</p>
<p>"Did the bullet actually hit me?"</p>
<p>"Actually he just kind of grazed you. It wasn't that bad. You got
lucky."</p>
<p>That's when I realized Helena was still hanging onto my hand. It
wasn't a soft touch either. No. She was actually hanging onto my
hand. I don't think she'd have let go if a thousand talking
chimpanzees came up to her and started interviewing her.</p>
<p>"Does that mean now I get some superhero star patch that tells the
world I've taken a bullet for the city?"</p>
<p>I don't think Helena finds this funny because she's not smiling nor
smirking nor grinning slightly.</p>
<p>"It isn't funny Dinah. You could have died."</p>
<p>"But I didn't."</p>
<p>"But you could have."</p>
<p>"But I didn't."</p>
<p>"But you COULD have."</p>
<p>"But I didn't."</p>
<p>I'm sure if we could have gone on like that the entire night if
Barbara hadn't come in to settle it. "Enough," she said, "Dinah you
could have died and Helena she didn't. Do we all have the facts
straight now?"</p>
<p>Helena and I look at each other and then turn our attention to
Barbara. I'm not too sure what the look meant but I just figured we
agreed to not talk about this anymore. At least that's what I was
going for in the look.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling, Dinah?" Barbara asks as she comes closer to my
bedside and starts inspecting all my wounds. "Your hands? Do they
still hurt?"</p>
<p>Helena is still holding onto my hand and Barbara, I'm sure, takes
note of this but decides not to comment.</p>
<p>"I can't really feel anything except my side."</p>
<p>"Well that's to be expected. How is everything else?"</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what Barbara means by everything else. I mean my
health seems fine. I'm in rather good spirits considering I could
have died but didn't. Oh wait yes that's now all consuming fear
enveloping my heart. I was shot. I could have died. If Helena hadn't
stopped that guy then I would be dead. Also, Reese didn't save my
life so I don't owe him for anything. There are plusses to near death
experiences it would seem. Mostly though I think I was a little
afraid. And little afraid should be expressed differently like
completely and utterly terrified. What good were all these weird
powers I had if I could still get shot and not even know it. I mean
tonight I threw a guy with some weird energy thing because I really
wanted to yet I didn't recognize getting shot. I didn't recognize the
fact that someone was even pointing a gun at me until it was too
late. Yes completely and utterly terrified kind of sums things up
nicely.</p>
<p>"I'm doing fine." I finally answer Barbara. She doesn't believe me. I
don't think anyone else in the room believes me. I don't believe me
but I don't want to talk about this now.</p>
<p>I could always pretend like it didn't happen. And if it didn't happen
then I don't have to deal with anything. I can just move on with my
life and everything will be fine. That'll solve all kinds of problems
for me. If I pretend like I don't feel anything towards Helena then I
have no reason to get jealous over Reese (although that hasn't been
working to well) I can pretend like getting shot didn't scare me and
we can continue living on acting like one big happy family. Superhero
family. The only pain I have to work through is the physical and I've
done that before. It's no big deal.</p>
<p>I remove my hand as carefully as possible from Helena's grip and turn
my head so that I don't have to be faced with either of their gazes.</p>
<p>"I'm kind of tired. It'd probably be a good idea for me to get some
sleep. You know with the whole being shot thing making me weak and
all." This is my dismissal for them. Barbara has checked up on me.
I'm still alive and she doesn't look too worried so I think I'm going
to make it through the night and Helena and I have had our little
argument about what happened. It's time for them to leave me alone
now. I don't care how hurt they both look from it. I can't care at
least not about this.</p>
<p>They each make their way towards the door and they each take one look
back as they leave. They're going to give me my space. That's a good
thing. I notice however that after Helena leaves she doesn't shut the
door all the way. She leaves it open just a crack but it's still
open.</p>
