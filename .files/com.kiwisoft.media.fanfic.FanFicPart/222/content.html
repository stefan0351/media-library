<!-- On Occasion: In a Limo \ Story -->

<p>"The last time I was in a limo was not fun Willow." I say
crossing my arms. "And let me think, why, yes, that was just earlier
this evening and shortly afterwards I had the joyful expierence of
being hunted."</p>

<p>She ignores me and runs ahead to get the limo door open. "For
the Slayer." She says with an exagerated bow.</p>

<p>I slump in the seat reluctantly. "Still not enjoying myself."
I mumble.</p>

<p>She slides in the seat next to me and shuts the door. After
quietly whispering to the driver the car pulls away from the curb. She
settles beside me.</p>

<p>"Aw. Don't be grumpy." She whispers.</p>

<p>I squirm a bit, her hand has worked it's way up the back of my
neck and she's running her fingertips through my hair along my scalp.</p>

<p>"Who says I'm grumpy?" I ask. It takes some effort but I
manage to choke off the urge to purr.</p>

<p>Her fingers run along the rim of one ear and, against my
wishes, I press my head a little harder into her hand. </p>

<p>"What?" She askes innocently. "So the mighty Slayer isn't
upset at, not only having lost the Homecoming crown, but also having
her life saved by one Cordelia Chase?"</p>

<p>"She didn't save my life. Just..."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Willow demands. Her tone belies her actions. Where one
is demanding, pinning me to the floor, the other is soft, careful.
Yes, we've cuddled since..ah...the begining. But...she's...</p>

<p>Ah.</p>

<p>Running a finger lightly along the hairline on the back of my
neck..wow. </p>

<p>"She...uh..just..happened to timely intervene." I stammer.
Gotta change the subject. Turn the tables...could ask about Oz.. No.
That's low.</p>

<p>"Willow...what are you doing?" Oh yeah, that was swift. Just
invite her to make a coup de grace or whatever it is.</p>

<p>She slid closer and I didn't even notice. Her lips are just a
hairsbreath from my ear. I think. I'm too afraid to turn my head. I
can feel my ears getting hot. Is that her breath or...</p>

<p>"Me?" She breathes into my ear. Okay, it's both. "I'm
timely..intervening."</p>

<p>"We'll be home soon." I don't want to object, but someone has
to be pragmatic here. "And Mom, for once has bad timing. She's home."</p>

<p>"Yeah." Willow breaths. Her fingers still tracing patterns
along my flesh. "Mine are too. My parents  that is."</p>

<p>"So we better stop." I press home the point.</p>

<p>"Why?" She asks innocently. If I dared look at her I'd see
mischief dancing in her eyes. But I can't. If I do I'll be lost. I
want to be lost. Damnit, responsibility blows.</p>

<p>"Cause..." Oh..nibble..no..don't nibble. Nibbling bad. Check
that...nibbling good! "Cause..no..uh..no time to finish what's been
started."</p>

<p>"Something's been started?" She asks. Note to self. Don't
talk. I talk, she answers..nibbling stops. Now that's bad!</p>

<p>I only nod. I could probably force myself to speak but that
would distract me from the warm humm buzzing around my..self.</p>

<p>"I guess that's why.." Soft..she's so soft. "That I told the
driver.." Her face is buried in the crux of my shoulder. She's nipping
at my neck. My hand moves with it's own ideas and cups her cheek. "To
just drive around until told to stop."</p>

<p>"Oh God Willow you're such a smart girl!" I give in to the
demand, turn, grab her face in my hands and dive in.</p>

<p>It's been..feels like forever but we only cuddled a few days
ago. She meets my advance with her own, equal need. Need? Sure. I feel
needy, I feel hungry. I ...want this. So does she. I'm not stupid,
it's sorta an obvious clue with the way our tounges are trying to wrap
around each other. Her hands are fumbling with the zipper on the back
of my dress. My own are tugging the straps of her dress off her
shoulders. </p>

<p>She breaks the kiss off.</p>

<p>"Not just any smart girl." She breathes. She's wearing her
strawberry gloss. I swear off cherry for life! "Your smart girl."</p>

<p>"Amen." I whisper back. More kissage!</p>

<hr>

<p>I swear I'm ready to pop. </p>

<p>I'm so..divided. Part of me is screaming that this is wrong,
being with a girl 'that' way. I pay it no never mind though. That's
just panic.

	Another part is ready to burn in embarassment. We're
getting..that's..uh..I..we're together. No that doesn't work, we're
together lots but this is... Okay, alright, I'll say it. We're going
to make love. In the backseat of  car. </p>

<p>Isn't this some sort of 'rite of passage' all girls have to go
through? Hot lovin' in the back seat?</p>

<p>Well, at least it's a spacious back seat. Why am I
complaining? I instigated this. Hope Buffy doesn't ask me why though.
I'm pretty sure any embarassment potential would hit critical mass.
'Oh yes Buffy, seeing you all hot n'sweaty, torn dress, kinda dirty,
kinda messy but so very alive got _me_
all hot n'sweaty! Nononono no no no..uh uh that would not work.</p>

<p>Ssss...course..uh..your nails tracing...un..patterns along my
thighs..yeah..that works. Really well. In fact..it's really
..ha..working too well. Can't pay attention to er..what I was trying
..ohboy..to..do. </p>

<p>No, no this is not good at all. I started this, I'm gonna
finish it. We've been kissing the entire time, I sorta went on
autopilot. Zoned. Buffy Summers Lips are a powerful zone causing
element. Might I add highly addictive? She's trailing a path of tiny
carreses with her lips along my jawline this very second. </p>

<p>"Buffy turn around." I say. </p>

<p>"Mmm.." </p>

<p>"C'mon, turn around!" I pressed.</p>

<p>"But why?" She groaned slightly. </p>

<p>"Cause I wanna play." Gosh, a sexual innduendo. What's
happening to me? Where did shy Willow go? She wouldn't have realised
an innduendo that was carefully introduced to her by name. </p>

<p>Oh God, I just remembered that whole 'Playing Doctor' thing
when Buffy was in the hospital. But I'm diffrent, I'm..more. She's in
my arms, she's turned around, albiet grumplily, and in the name of
Tootins' I'm gonna play!</p>

<p>"Don't complain now." I kiss the back of her neck. She tries
not to react but I feel her breath catch in your throat. "See? This
way I can finally get this darn zipper of yours. Won't that be nice?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." She murmers. I don't think she can hear me. Maybe
that's because I've started nuzzling her while slowly unzipping the
aformentioned dress. "Nice."</p>

<p>I ease the top off her shoulders, bending over as I do so to
kiss my way down her neck along her back. Each new inch of skin I find
and mark as mine. Her head has fallen back against my shoulder and it
sounds like she's having a hard time remaining stoic. Good.</p>

<p>"You like?" I murmer.</p>

<p>"This..." She groans. "This shouldn't feel this good."</p>

<p>"Somethings's wrong then?" I ask innocently. Her arms have
gone all slack so I have to lift them one at a time an ease them out
of her dress.</p>

<p>"Oh no." I can hear her smile. "Something is very right."</p>

<p>I push the dress down to her waist slowly, dragging my thumbs
along her ribs. Her head is still resting against my shoulder but now
she's bare from the waist up save for her bra. </p>

<p>It's a silky green one. When did she get it? It's beautiful,
cups her breasts so lovingly. Giving them a slight push, leaving the
tops almost completly exposed. So white and smooth and... it's almost
a shame to take it off. Almost.</p>

<p>Oh, it's off. So much for regret.</p>

<p>I toss the bra over my shoulder. Really gotta remember to stop
trying to be cool; it never works for me. The bra just bounces of the
roof of the car and lands on my head. Buffy who's been watching me out
of the corner of her eyes just stares at me. She's trying very hard
not to laugh, she swallows a few times but manages to make do.</p>

<p>"Swell." I pout. "Seduction factor plummets like stone in
river. Willow Wonder at three o'clock."</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is just so typical. I'm trying to be something more, be a
little..extra. Buffy could have done, she'd have tossed my bra...I
want her to toss my bra..I want her..she could have tossed it anywhere
and it would have landed just in the right place. I can't even hit the
ground! What if I destroyed the moment? What if I've broken
everything? Would she leave me? Just wanna go back to being friends?
No, not that. Once you've had Buffy, you can never go back. </p>

<p>	Buffy spins around instantly. How does she move that
fast? </p>

<p>"Don't you say that!" She admonishes me fiercly pointing at my
face.. How she can be fierce while being exotic, yummy looking and
topless all at the same time remains a mystery. </p>

<p>"Don't you dare think that you're not anything less than
incredibly desireable!" I blink. I think I blink. They are kinda fast. </p>

<p>Desirable? </p>

<p>Buffy slides right up next to me, the temperature just went
up. She...her..they're..she's pressed up againt me. She smiling a
small smile.</p>

<p>"And as for seduction level.." She walks her fingers up my
nose then runs them through my hair pushing my head back a little.</p>

<p>She bends down and begins to kiss her way down my neck while
at the same time effortlessly slipping the straps of my dress along my
arms till it falls free. She did this while kissing me and I couldn't
even get a darn zipper. Ah well..it's all...in the ..is it supposed to
feel so... tingly?</p>

<p>She hasn't stopped kissing me, down my throat above the rise
of my..ah..no. They're mine, I can say it, say them. I've had them
for, oh, at least four years now. She's kissing the rise of my
bre..br..oh ..out of time..there goes..my bra
and...she..hhmmm...hmmm...sweet...hmmm...</p>

<p>Fingers..can feel her fingers, carrassing the underside..just
barely though. What she's doing with her lips taking..up...most of
...mind. Huummm....right there...no..don't move...to the move back
up..up!</p>

<p>I grab her head gently and steer her back on course but she
resists. Nooo..she's stopped...don't leave my breasts! They want more
attention, I want more attention! Where are you going you silly
Slayer?</p>

<p>Hey. I said breasts! Yay ...</p>

<p>Stop that! That tickles..no no..don't scrape my ribs. You'll
ruin the moment. She's kissing me still..down..down...</p>

<p>I feel her hands leave my sides. Now she's cradling my calves.
Sliding her fingers slowly up along the insides of legs while she
keeps dabbing at my bellybutton. It stopped tickling..feels nice. Not
 nice like it was earlier but nice...</p>

<p>Gentle pressure on the insides of my thighs. She's easing
..me..open and her ..lips are ..still...moving down and..she..she's..</p>

<p>"Buffy?" I recall that this is how one is supposed to talk.
However I seem to be squeaking. "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>She stops her nuzzle, lick, kiss technique to look up at me.
She's now crouched on the floor of the limo, between my..legs. Her
hands have slipped up to my hips and her fingers have curled around
the band of..eh..heh..my panties. All I have to do is lift my butt
and...</p>

<p>Check that, I probably wouldn't have to do even that. She's
got all those nifty slayer muscles.</p>

<p>She tilts her head up to look me in the eyes. She's got that
half smile on her face, it's her 'I think I've got a good idea,
really.' look. </p>

<p>"I've always called you yummy Willow." She says.  "Now I'm
going to test that claim."</p>

<p>She's not talking loudly but her everyword is echoing inside
the limo. Or my head. I'll never forget her tone, softness, the light
in her eyes. This second is going right into long term memory. Labled
under 'Things to Love in Recollection'. </p>

<p>She's going to...she's going..she's gonna..gonna...</p>

<p>"Oh." I squeak.</p>

<p>"Okay." I lick my lips nervously. "Let's hope..uh..I'm..less
filling?" </p>

<p>She just smiles wider and I lift up off the seat so
she..can...do what she ..wants.</p>

<hr>

<p>Projecting confidance is easy. </p>

<p>Being confidant. That's hard. In a way I'm jealous of Willow.
She's strung tighter than a guitar string and I have every intent of
giving her a really good 'twang'!</p>

<p>But at least she's comfortable enough to be uncomfortable!
Around me that is. I don't know what the hell I'm doing, I don't even
know why I'm doing! I've never done this before. With...er..that is.
No, absoluty nothing similar to this in my past. Ever! </p>

<p>It just..seems like a good thing to do. So..deep breath
sla...no. Not the slayer. Deep breath Summers. Gonna make love to
Willow in brand new ways!</p>

<p>She lifts her hips and I slide her panties down, slipping them
over her ankles. </p>

<p>Black lace! Impressive.</p>

<p>She's right there. In front of me. At eye level. New. </p>

<p>It's not like I haven't seen stuff like this before...but I
havn't. Not like this. Never before like this.</p>

<p>She's mine. She's ..sharing..allowing..doing this for me, us,
her.. it doesn't matter. This is the first time. It'll only happen
once and I have to appreciate it..I have to treasure it..I have
to..stop being so damn introspective. </p>

<p>Poor Willow's she's trying not to shake. Her hands are resting
on her thighs beside my head and I take one in each of my own hands
and kiss the palms. </p>

<p>"Shhhh.." I say into her hands then look up at her. "Do you
trust me?"</p>

<p>She begins to nod, stops, seems to reconsider and decides to
say her mind.</p>

<p>"Yes. Yeah..I mean..wow..never would have seen this coming
but..oh..but..I..y'know I should have. I mean I know I should have or
something..and..yes. Yes I do trust you Buffy. Really."</p>

<p>When Willow speaks her mind she speaks _all_  of it!</p>

<p>I like that about her.</p>

<p>I close my eyes and inhale carefully. I can..smell her
arousal. It's..not unappealing. I..want this..
I do. Just..like that. Musty and..rich..sweet..I.. I think that's
Willow in a way. She..reminds me..her..arousal..uh.. she's Willow.  </p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Gosh.</p>

<p>I lean down... I wanna go slow. Just like before. Don't want
to startle her or nothing. I lay my cheek against the bare flesh of
her left thigh and just begin to murmer. It's sooo..cool and soft
against my cheek. I feel all..hot and..and..well..duh. But it's..her
thigh..is so ..relaxing. I turn my face a bit and brush my lips across
the skin. A tremor runs along her, I can see her hands squeesing into
fists. Her breathing has gotten kinda husky and strained. </p>

<p>I know the feeling.</p>

<p>I move up...kissing, licking. Where the tendon is most
apparant just below..her.. I nip it betwen my lips.

	Willow reacts with a low, humming sound in the back of her
throat. </p>

<p>"Hmmmmm..." She says. "Hmmmmm...."</p>

<p> She's moved her hands off her thighs and is resting them on
top of my head. Her fingers glide through my hair, her nails moving
back and forth over my skin. I bet she doesn't even know what she's
doing. I wonder if she's even looking? I'm not about to stop to check. </p>

<p>I stop. I need to focus..to..understand. This...is all
happening so fast and ... I'm... not too sure. Gotta not get swept up
but do this..because I want too</p>

<p>But..I do want too. I do. I'm so now aware of just how much,
how right this is. My whole body is aching with need. Not for my own
satisifaction though. For hers. I am going to play my Willow like an
instrument and make sweet music! I'm going to rock her world and give
her one hell of a memory. I'm going to give her ..give... I'm going to
have her coming and going!</p>

<p>Without hesiting I dive in. </p>

<p>I run my tounge slowly..from the bottom to the very top. </p>

<p>I never thought it would be like this.</p>

<p>So...soft.</p>

<p>So...gentle.</p>

<p>So...sharing and sweet.</p>

<p>So...so...PAINFUL!!</p>

<p>
	I break off, flapping my hands about inefectivly. "Nails
Willow!" I cry. "Nails, nails! Nails in my head! Bad! Ow! Ow! OWWW!!"</p>

<p>It takes a minute or two but a sense does return and I take a
moment to pry Willow's hands from off my skull. </p>

<p>"Oh God." Willow pants. I look at her.</p>

<p>Her head is thrown back on the seat, she's staring at the
ceiling but I'm willing to bet money she doesn't see it. With her
fingers pried loose from my scalp they're now hanging listlessly at
her sides. Her  chest heaves as she keeps reapeating 'oh god' over and
over. </p>

<p>For a second I'm worried.</p>

<p>Then her eyes lock with mine.</p>

<p>Now I'm _really_ worried!</p>

<p>"You stopped." Willow says quietly.</p>

<p>"Well...cause ..uh..your nails..and..my head..kinda..y'know.."
I stammer.</p>

<p>"Don't stop." Willow says. "Please..please please please don't
stop."</p>

<p>I smile, it's probably a rather silly looking grin but I can't
help feel a little proud. "That good huh?" I ask.</p>

<p>She shakes her head and swallows a few times. "You have no
idea." She mumbles then shoots me a wicked grin. "But if you're good
I'll show you!"</p>

<p>Now it's my turn to swallow. "Is...is that a promise?" I hope
my voice isn't trembling. </p>

<p>She slowly nods and her smile grows a very..appealing shade of
'Sneaky'. "Uh huh." </p>

<p>"Then lean back babe and.." I grimace. "Hold on to your seat,
not my head.  You're about to go for a ride!"</p>

<p>"Goody." She murmers.</p>

<p>I have to start over of course. I move to begin kissing her
belly again but her hands on my shoulders intercept me. I glance up at
her.</p>

<p>She's looking at me with such a...she seems so hungry
and..deseperate. "Please Buffy." She whines. "No more games."</p>

<p>"Now?" I ask. I have to fight now a victorius grin and settle
for an aprraising look complete with raised eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Now." She nods.</p>

<p>"Your wish..." I begin.</p>

<p>Moving down past her belly button, I get a tweak of regret it
is such a cute navel, I give her a soft, tender kiss. The shudder that
ripples down her is anything but, her pelvis thrusts outward and I
have to pull back a bit or get clocked.</p>

<p>"More!" She gasps. "Please..oh please God now more!"</p>

<p>I oblidge her.</p>

<p>Right at the top, just above her clit I poke that spot with my
tounge. Willow gives another involuntary heave, not as...heftworthy as
the first. I think I hear her nails tear through the surface of the
car seats. Well, better it than my head.</p>

<p>Willow's breathing is nowhere near regular now. It comes in
great shuddering gasps depending on what I do. If I just touch her she
lets out this brief squeak, if I run my tounge from top to bottom or
bottom to top she takes in this big gasp and then lets it out slowly
with an acompanying  'hummmm..'</p>

<p>I said I'd play her like an instrument but this...</p>

<p>Her hands have left the seat and are now, again, intwined with
my hair, it's risk but..I kinda like it. The traceing of her fingers,
the squeeses. All tell me I'm doing something right, that it's special
and she wants it, wants me. Needs me...maybe..maybe even.. I mean..I
know I..that is..I think I..</p>

<p>Whoa! Must have done something right there! She's grabbed
fistfuls of my hair, she's not pulling it so it doesn't hurt but..</p>

<p>"So close.." She whines. I can tell she's speaking between
clenched teeth. "Oh God...little more..please...Buffy.."</p>

<p>I carefully enter her with just the tip of my index finger and
curl it upwards to stroke gently at the top of her inside, at the same
time I move my lips and caress her clit with my lips, licking it in
time with the movements of my hand. </p>

<p>I ..think that should do the...</p>

<p>"Yes..yes...yes....yes....." She approves. "Oh God..Oh
God...Buffy..."</p>

<p>Her head whipsnaps back against the seat and I have to move
fast to hold her down. My arms snake quicky around her legs so she
can't kick away and I can keep in contact. It's good and right and
sweet and I want her to have it forever and ever. Sides, she's good
and right and sweet too.
Did I just... well..she is. So there.</p>

<p>She heaves against the seat, but she never pulls at my hair
even though her legs have wrapped around me and she has her ankles
locked behind me, pulling me close. As if I'd ever pull away from her.
'Specially now.</p>

<p>This quiet wail echoes around me, I know it's her, it get's
softer and softer as she comes down, slowly..I havn't stopping
pleaseing her. I kiss around her, her lips, I lick her up, eat her,
satisfy her. Doing it right, doing it gently. Occasionally her wail
starts to climb then ease back down..down..down..finally quiet. </p>

<p>Just her, taking deep, slow...breaths. Sorta gasping but more
restful. And I realise, we're both gasping. I'm resting right along
with her and in my own way I'm satisifed. I've done good, I've done
right and she looks so beautiful right now. I lay my head on the soft
skin of her right thigh; her skin is cool again, no longer blazing
with heat. I gaze up at her. She seems to glow. Her head is resting
sideways, eyes half open in a droopy fasion. Her fingers still slide
in my hair, slowly...slowly...and she just seems to be asleep..but
not. </p>

<p>I think...I think...I think I do...</p>

<p>"Kiss me." She mumbles.</p>

<p>"Sure!" I chirup. "Just let me wipe.."</p>

<p>She yanks me up to her eye level and savagley practically
swallows my head. Her tounge dances between my teeth and I just sit
there and let it. She flickers about, tasting, kissing, sucking...I
finally begin to return the kiss and her arms ease down the back of my
head, over my shoulders to rest, clasped together around my waist. </p>

<p>The kiss ends and she pulls away, I can't help it, I lean
foward wanting more. Now that she's satisifed my own desires are
screaming through me with a vengence. She intercepts me with a finger
across my lips.</p>

<p>"Three things." She whispers while looking into my eyes. "One,
I don't care about tasting or anything.  Two. Thank you, it
was....beyond..anything. It was...I can't..can't find the words." Her
eyes glaze over a bit.</p>

<p>"And..and the third?" I ask. Yearning..wanting
hoping..waiting.</p>

<p>"What?" She asks me innocenty.</p>

<p>"Willow!" I try to be threatening but to my own ears it sounds
like a plea. </p>

<p>"Oh..right." She nods. "Three. Now you find out what words
can't tell you." </p>

<p>
	Still demonstrating strength that belies her nature she flips
me over so our positions are reversed. She stradles my waist
practically sinks her teeth into my neck. It's sudden and ferocious,
nothing like her normal behaivore. My breath catches in my throat as
totaly unexpected sensations bombard me. </p>

<p>Her hands trail down my sides bypassing my tits and I feel the
frustration build, giving voice to it with a tiny whimper. I heave a
bit, trying to get some stimulation, some feeling, anything more will
do. I try and brush my chest against hers but she pulls away.</p>

<p>"Willow." I growl, I don't mean to but it's rolling around in
the back of my throat, my heart, my mind. The Hunger. "Stop it...
please. You promised to show me..." Now I'm whining. Greeeaaattt...</p>

<p>Willow pulls back and smiles imishly at me. "I did promise to
show you Buffy. Never promised to make it quick though." Funny, her
smile is the same old, adorable, Willow smile but for some reason,
right now it looks a little...sharp?</p>

<p>I'm in trouble.</p>

<p>I slowly lift my arms and cradle her cheeks in my hands. She
pushes her cheek against my palm, sorta like a cat and mumbles a bit.
Almost like a purr. </p>

<p>"Trust me?" She asks quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes." I say back and pull her in close, the kiss is soft,
just lips to lips. More of a promise of touch than actual contact.
With her face less than an inches from my own her eyes open very wide
and I see a flash in her green eyes. Her smile is wide, fierce and
predatory. </p>

<p>"Good." She says back. </p>

<p>Before I can blink she's ducked her head and her lips are
fastened around my left breast. Again it's so damn fast! Too fast, it
takes a heartbeat for my mind to register the new feelings ping
ponging along my spine. Than it plays catchup. </p>

<p>I think my brain just bounced off the top of my skull. </p>

<p>I know I jumped off the seat and somehow in that split second
Willow has snagged my panties and swept them off. At least I think.
When I come back down and the stars stop popping in front of my eyes
Willow, still stradling my lap, is smirking at me, dangling my
underwear from the tip of one finger. </p>

<p>"All this without Slayer bonuses." She chuckles. </p>

<p>I can't say anything to that.  I can't say anything at all.
Sure the starts have faded away but my mind is still humming a happy
tune. My whole body is thrumming, content, still hungry but
..it..I..we..know that this is it. </p>

<p>"Nn..." I think I get that out. "W...Willow." </p>

<p>"Shhhhh..." She whispers coming back close to me. Her lips
grace the spot between my eyes. "Relax."

	Her lips trace over the rise of my nose and along it's tip.
They slide lower, jumping over my own lips to give me a peck on my
chin. She moves lower, resting her hands on my shoulders as her lips
and tounge move down my throat, over my collarbone and slowly...oh god
so slowly..in the valley between my tits.

	A sigh works it's way out and I let my head fall back. I close
my eyes and savor the feelings. </p>

<p>She slides off my lap and I feel her crouch down on the floor.
Her tounge and lips never stop touching, moistening, kissing or
licking me. Hey! I'm ticklish in my belly button too! I did not know
that!</p>

<p>But it doen't bother me. </p>

<p>Her hands no longer reach my shoulders and she's moved them to
cup my breasts but only for a second. Again I voice my dissapointment
with a slight whine. I hear her give a quiet giggle. </p>

<p>Then...now..finally..her hands rest on my thighs. She's
pushing, just a little, a request not a demand.
I open my legs a bit, letting her in, letting her...I mean..she can
..that is..I'm ..I'm right there! For her. Part of me is rather
emberassed. </p>

<p>Did she feel this way when the roles were reversed? Cause my
stomach just got all tiny and scrunchwise. I can't seem to get enough
air, my hands want to shake right off my arms. Am I shaking? Am I
trembling? I can't tell...I know she did, but just a little. Did she
feel this way and I had so little clue? She's tougher than she looks;
but I knew that already. </p>

<p>I'm so nervous..and needy..and I want this and ..strangly..I
want to please her..again..but now it's my turn and she's gonna..she's
about too..she..she...</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</p>

<p>"Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Come back..c'mon..."</p>

<p>"Wills?" I mumble.</p>

<p>"Hey."</p>

<p>My eyes decide to work. First was was hearing, the roar
flooding my ears finally faded. Now eyes work. Willow is sitting
beside me with a half worried, half knowing smile on her face. That's
not..all..she has on her face. </p>

<p>Ah. There's feelings again. </p>

<p>Oh...my. </p>

<p>I've never...felt so..noodley. Like I was boiled, but in a
good way. I don't think I have a solid bone in my body. They've gone
all slushy on me. Mmmmm...but it feels so very nice. I'm so content
right now. Not even Acathla doing an encore would bother me. </p>

<p>"Welcome back." Willow smiles more widely.</p>

<p>She's all sparkly right now. A knowing grin showing teeth. I
lazily flop my arm around her shoulders and pull her in for a kiss. As
always, our tounges carry a merry duel but there's a certain lazy
energy now. Not opening moves but more closure than anything else. The
kiss ends and she pulls away still wearing that knowing smirk. </p>

<p>"You look like a cat that swallowed a canary." I say beeping
her on the nose with a finger.</p>

<p>"Meyow." She whispers. "I ate very well thank you."</p>

<p>"WILLOW!" I try and sit bolt upright but my muscles are all
'If you think we're moving, you're crazy. Enjoy the buzz Summers.
Enjoy the buzz.' I have little choice but to agree.</p>

<p>She just giggles. "What?" She asks batting her eyelids. "We
did the deed, still can't talk the talk?"</p>

<p>"Gods." I groan. "I've created a monster."</p>

<p>"Yeppers" She agrees still grinning. Than a look of worry
crosses her face. "Uh..you're not going to stake me are you?"</p>

<p>"Well.." Now it's my turn to smile mischivioulsy. "Not through
the heart." I place my open hand in the vally between her breasts and
delibritly slide it down over her belly stopping just before my
fingertips can slide under her dress which is still bunched up around
her waist.</p>

<p>Her eyes widen very much so and her she mouths a silent 'oh'. </p>

<p>"Maybe something in pastels." I mumble still fingering the
material of her dress.</p>

<p>"That a promise?" She oozes sensuality and brings her face
close to mine, licking the tip of my nose. Our breasts mash together
and it just heightens the lazy pleasure still thrumbing about my
nerves. All a jinglejangle that's me.</p>

<p>"Oooo.." I laugh. "You are nasty!"</p>

<p>"Actually I'm thirsty." She replies. Very nochalantly too,
considering we're in the back of a rented limo, basically naked. She
looks a little more demure than I do, what with me being basically
sprawled all over the back seat. </p>

<p>"This thing got bar?" I mumble trying to make myself a bit
more presentable. Willow reaches over and opens the right window with
the flick of a switch. The cool air flows inside and I revel in the
sensation of it sliding over my skin. Drying sweat
and...y'know..stuff.</p>

<p>"Actually I did." She says and holds up a bottle. "Fruit
punch?"</p>
