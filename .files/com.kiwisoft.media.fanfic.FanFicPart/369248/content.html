<p><b>Chapter 4</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Ooh, mystery meat. Bad choice, my friend."</p>
<p>Lilly looked up at Oliver with a half-hearted shrug. He sat down across from her at the table, followed by one of his only two friends, Sarah. Though several people had tried to 'recruit' her as she thought of it, Lilly had decided to just stick with Oliver – once she'd explained to him she wasn't interested he'd calmed down a lot. He was actually a pretty nice guy and Sarah was alright, too, if a bit kooky.</p>
<p>"So, Lilly, I was wondering if you wanted to come hang out with us on Saturday?" asked Oliver, mouth full of mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>Lilly tried not to let her lack of enthusiasm show. In all honesty, she'd hoped maybe Miley would come by again and they could spend the day together. But she had no way to contact her mysterious friend, nor could she remember where exactly the girl lived. And as much as she wanted to, there was no way she'd spend all of her Saturday sitting inside, waiting for the possibility Miley might show up. So she nodded, even plastering a weak smile on her face.</p>
<p>"Cool. If it's nice, we're going to the creek. It's this awesome place to swim and hang out."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've been there," said Lilly, digging in her food.</p>
<p>Oliver looked surprised. "You have? How'd you find it?"</p>
<p>"Miley showed me." Only too late did Lilly realize she probably shouldn't have mentioned that part. She could've come up with some lie, anything to avoid the wide-eyed, panicked looks from her companions.</p>
<p>"Miley?" said Sarah, voice louder and more forceful than Lilly had ever heard her.</p>
<p>Oliver made an angry noise. "You're still hanging out with her? I thought I told you to stop?"</p>
<p>Lilly scoffed, annoyance flaring inside of her. "I'm sorry, I must've missed the part where you became my <b>mom</b>."</p>
<p>Sarah shook her head as if breaking out of a stupor and put a hand on Lilly's arm. "Lilly, you just don't understand."</p>
<p>"<b>What</b> don't I understand?"</p>
<p>"Miley is…she's…just stay away from her, okay?"</p>
<p>The way they were talking made Lilly briefly wonder if Miley was gay and they were shunning the girl. She pulled her arm away. "Why do you guys hate her so much?"</p>
<p>"We don't hate her, it's…" Oliver started, wiping the palms of his hands on his pants. He was nervous and Sarah, too, looked more worried than angry.</p>
<p>Lilly looked at them, confused. "You're scared of her?"</p>
<p>Oliver and Sarah met each other's eyes, before turning back to Lilly. "It'd be better if you stayed far away from her."</p>
<p>"What are you scared of? She's just a girl."</p>
<p>Oliver scoffed and shook his head. Sarah looked imploringly at Lilly. "Just…trust us, okay?"</p>
<p>They turned their attention back to their food, effectively ending the conversation. Lilly sat in stunned silence, too confused and angry to eat. What had Miley done to them to make them act like this? She remembered Oliver's words from her first day, warning her not to tell anyone else she'd spoken to Miley. Was everyone else afraid of her, too? And why? Lilly wanted answers and she was not getting them.</p>

<p>"Miley!"</p>
<p>The brunette turned, face almost apprehensive, until she saw Lilly skating towards her. Miley grinned at her friend as she jumped off the skateboard next to her. Lilly felt her heart racing and it had nothing to do with skating. Miley's hair was up in a loose bun and the light wind was pushing strands of it into her face. A lollipop was in her mouth and her eyes sparkled with excitement. She looked absolutely adorable and Lilly wanted nothing more than to be able to kiss her.</p>
<p>"Hi there, Lilly. Where ya going?" asked Miley, her smile infectious.</p>
<p>Slightly emboldened by her conversation with Sarah and Oliver the other day, Lilly wanted to prove Miley was not scary. "I heard there are some places in the park people use to skate. I was gonna go check it out. Wanna come with?"</p>
<p>Miley popped the lollipop out of her mouth and shook her head. "I can't. I gotta get home; I'm in trouble. Double trouble."</p>
<p>She grinned at the last part, but Lilly looked at her slightly apprehensively. "What did you do?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "I'm grounded and I snuck out to get some candy."</p>
<p>"Why are you grounded?"</p>
<p>Miley smiled, mischief clearly evident on her face. "I was messin' with the chickens."</p>
<p>Lilly raised an eyebrow at that, not understanding. Then again, she thought, if she were home schooled, she might have to resort to playing tricks on the chickens for entertainment. "Maybe your mom won't notice you were gone?"</p>
<p>"She'll know," said Miley then sighed heavily. "Momma's gonna be mad when she finds out I went into town by myself. Oh well, it was worth it. I got to see you."</p>
<p>She grinned at her and Lilly couldn't help but return it, though part of her was still worried and confused. "Miley, how old are you?"</p>
<p>"How old do you think I am?"</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes in exasperation, though in all honesty, it had been a valid question. She'd briefly wondered whether Miley was afflicted with whatever condition Robin Williams had in that movie where he looked thirty but was twelve; she couldn't see any other reason a mother would prohibit a teenager from going into a town where nothing happened on her own. Then she'd realized how ridiculous that was.</p>
<p>Miley relented. "I'm sixteen. How old are you?"</p>
<p>"I'll be seventeen in a month."</p>
<p>Miley's eyes lit up. "I better think of a good present for you then."</p>
<p>Lilly felt suddenly uncomfortable; she could tell the girl had no money. "You don't have to do that. I'm sure I'll be having a party; I'll be happy if you just show up."</p>
<p>Miley's smile fell slightly and she averted her eyes. Lilly realized with a sinking feeling that it was unlikely anyone from her school would attend her party if Miley were there. And it seemed that Miley knew it, too. Lilly wanted to apologize, but she didn't even know <b>what</b> she would be apologizing for. She really needed some answers.</p>
<p>"Miley, can I ask you something?" said Lilly, suddenly nervous. She just couldn't deal with being in the dark anymore.</p>
<p>Blue eyes met hers and Miley nodded. Lilly noticed the girl was biting her lower lip and hesitated. It was written clear as day on Miley's face – she knew what Lilly wanted to ask and she did not want to answer. Lilly had a feeling Miley would answer anyway. She suddenly felt bad. She didn't want to make the girl do something she was clearly uncomfortable with. Lilly swallowed hard.</p>
<p>"Can I have your phone number? I mean, I'm getting kinda tired of skating around town all day hoping to run into you. This way I could just call you." They both knew it wasn't what she had planned on asking, but there was no way Lilly would do anything to make that beautiful smile vanish.</p>
<p>And Miley did smile, turning Lilly into mush again. She nodded though, and Lilly pulled out her cell phone to program in the number Miley dictated to her. "I don't have anything to write with…I'll give you mine next time. Is this your cell number?"</p>
<p>"Nah, mom says I don't need one, since I'm home schooled and all. We just have the house phone. Don't tell anyone I gave you the number though, mom doesn't like me giving it out."</p>
<p>Lilly stared at her somewhat dumbfounded for a second, before catching herself. "Uh Miley, you do realize your mom will know you gave me your number when I call, right?"</p>
<p>Miley snorted. "Good point. Oh well, it's fine."</p>
<p>Lilly wasn't sure that it was and wondered if she'd ever get up the nerve to call Miley now. Miley suddenly stopped and Lilly realized for the first time they'd been walking. How could she get so caught up in one person she didn't even notice her surroundings?</p>
<p>"This is the turn to my grandma's farm. The park's that way," said Miley, pointing to her left. She smiled. "Thanks for walking with me, Lilly."</p>
<p>"The pleasure was all mine," said Lilly and winked, then blushed immediately. When had she gotten so cheesy and idiotic?</p>
<p>Miley just laughed. "Goodbye, Lilly from California." She took the lollipop from her mouth and darted forward to leave a sticky, sweet kiss on Lilly's cheek. Miley gave her one last grin, before turning down the road towards her house.</p>
<p>Lilly watched her go in stunned silence. Why was this girl so impossible to figure out? And how could anyone expect her to stay away when Miley made her heart flutter and her limbs go weak and her brain turn to mush? With a sigh, Lilly got back on her skateboard to make her way to the park.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>Lilly stood in line, trying not to get annoyed. Her mother had forced her to come along for groceries and now here she was, stuck behind two middle-aged women who had nothing better to do than hold up the entire line with their gossip. She had never seen anyone scan groceries as slowly as the woman at the register, too busy chatting with her friend to really pay attention. Even worse, Lilly's mother seemed to not care one bit, as if she had already gotten used to the slow-paced way of life in this town. Lilly had half a mind to tell the ladies to hurry it up, when she heard something that made her listen more closely.</p>
<p>"Mable, did I tell you Miley Stewart came in the other day?" said the woman at the register, lowering her voice as if she was telling a big secret.</p>
<p>The other woman, Mable, gaped at her, almost drawing back at her words. "No! You let her in?"</p>
<p>The cashier nodded importantly, clearly enjoying the attention she was receiving. "Well, I had to, she was buying. You know George would skin my hide if he knew I was turnin' away payin' customers. He says he don't believe in all that nonsense."</p>
<p>Mable looked almost outraged. "Nonsense? You don't have to be some kind of special to know something ain't right. It would serve old George right, if somethin' were to happen to his store...allowing that girl in here."</p>
<p>The cashier's eyes almost gleamed in excitement, as if she couldn't wait to share more. "Oh, last night the power went out…we had to throw out all the frozen food this morning."</p>
<p>Mable gasped, putting a hand to her chest. She seemed to compose herself and shook her head. "It just ain't right; someone oughta do something."</p>
<p>"I heard she ain't supposed to come into town; her momma and grandma watch that girl like hawks, but she just don't listen to nobody'!"</p>
<p>Mable heaved a sigh, "I don't know how they do it, stayin' out there with her all alone…after everything that's happened. Lord knows, if that were my daughter…if I'd lost my husband and son like that…I woulda left, never came back."</p>
<p>Lilly gasped at the woman's words and both of them turned to her, giving her evil looks as if she was impossibly rude for listening in. The cashier finally rang up her friend's purchases and Lilly stacked their items on the conveyor absentmindedly. Her thoughts were jumbled and she was even more confused than before. It wasn't just the kids at her school that seemed to dislike and even fear Miley, but grown adults talked about her like she was the plague. Lilly thought about the women's words. It sounded as if Miley's father and brother had died and the thought of her friend having to go through that pained her. Why would these people shun a girl who'd suffered a great tragedy? Why did they talk about her like she was something to be feared?</p>
<p>Lilly had half a mind to ask the cashier, but she was too angry with the woman for saying such horrible things about her friend. Miley had been nothing but nice to Lilly and she about to turn her back on the girl just because some people were obviously crazy. But she was going to get to the bottom of this.</p>
