<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 9 -->

<p>Buffy swung the jeep into her driveway and slammed on the brakes.</p>
<p>She hopped out the drivers side door and went into the house.</p>
<p>She sat down at the kitchen table and started to think.</p>
<p>'Faith. I'm so sorry. Things are getting totally out of control I don't know what to do. I want to stop but... sometimes I need it. I need an escape. It's all I've got.'</p>
<p align="center">------------------In The Hospital----------------------</p>
<p>Giles and Willow ran over to Faith's bedside.</p>
<p>"F-Faith?"</p>
<p>Her eyes were open but just barely.</p>
<p>"Giles? Is that you? Willow?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's me and Giles. Me and Giles here to see you."</p>
<p>"Good to see nothings changed."</p>
<p>"Faith, are you aware of how long it's been?"</p>
<p>"How long what's been?"</p>
<p>Her head hurt and her left side was really aching.</p>
<p>"Faith, you've been in a coma, for just over a month you've been in this bed. Unconscious."</p>
<p>"I knew something was up, I didn't know it'd been so long but hey, I'm 5 by 5 now right?"</p>
<p>"Well..."</p>
<p>Apprehension showed on Giles face.</p>
<p>"They never expected you to wake up. Let alone without brain damage. There is a very good chance they will want to keep you here for further testing and..."</p>
<p>Faith didn't care about that.</p>
<p>"Hows Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Umm...well, perhaps Willow you should field this one. I have to go take care of some paperwork for Buffy and her abrupt departure."</p>
<p>Faith knew the outlook was bad. She had been using all her strength to communicate with Buffy, that was why it took her so long to heal.</p>
<p>"Will...what's his deal?"</p>
<p>"Giles is concerned. We all are. About Buffy about...you."</p>
<p>"Me?" Faith asked incredulously.</p>
<p>"Yes you. Faith, we knew you helped save us. Buffy told us about the dream, without it we all would have died. We knew it was you talking."</p>
<p>Faith almost started to tear. They cared about her? They believed she had tried to help? She quickly pushed thoughts of herself aside.</p>
<p>"Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Well, Buffy, we all like Buffy. Buffy's great. Buffy the vampire slayer, slayer of vampires..."</p>
<p>Faith cut her off.</p>
<p>"Willow!"</p>
<p>"Oh (Willow sigh) yeah. She-she's in alot of trouble right now. She's not dealing. Things are bad for her."</p>
<p>"I know. I mean is she ok after last night?"</p>
<p>"Oh that, yeah she'll be ok. She already busted out of here. Smashed her window and took off, in her mom's jeep to boot. Have you ever been in a car with her? I mean with her driving? Cause you probably were in a car when she wasn't driving and were with her but...the way she drives..."</p>
<p>"Willow..."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Shut-up"</p>
<p>"Ok."</p>
<p>Faith slowly and carefully removed her IV.</p>
<p>'Somthing about slayers and hospitals, as soon as they wake up they take the IV out. Don't they know they could get hurt?' Willow thought.</p>
<p>"It's ok Will, I'm better don't worry. I've got to find Buffy though, I have to set things right."</p>
<p>Faith replied as if reading Willow's mind.</p>
<p align="center">------------------At Buffy's House---------------------</p>
<p>Buffy walked over to her sink and drew a small amount of water from the tap, catching it in a small glass bottle.</p>
<p>She walked over to the kitchen table and sat down. She then took some of the brown powder and added it to the water, the sickly mixture was done.</p>
<p>Finding one of the needles she stuck it into the bottle and drew up the fluid into the syringe. She placed the set-up on her kitchen table and stood up.</p>
<p>Buffy tore off the bottom hem of her shirt. She used the cloth to tie a knot around her forearm, just below the elbow.</p>
<p>Again she sat down at the table.</p>
<p>Buffy picked up the syringe and looked at it, wondering what it would do to her and how she would feel...</p>
<p align="center">----------------Outside The Hospital-------------------</p>
<p>Faith was running down the street towards Buffy's house. She had to get there before the other slayer did something bad.</p>
<p>Shortly, she rounded the bend and hit Rubello Drive. A few more strides and she was in front of Buffy's house.</p>
<p align="center">------------------Inside The House---------------------</p>
<p>Somebody was outside, knocking hard on the door, but she didn't care.</p>
<p>Buffy was done thinking. She slid the needle into her arm and drained the fluid into her vein quickly.</p>
<p>Not long after she was in another world.</p>
<p>This time the colors were more vivid, and the pleasure more intense. She was skipping in a garden, a garden far more beautiful than before.</p>
<p>She saw reflections of her friends and herself as she used to be. For a brief moment she looked into the future and saw what could have been.</p>
<p>Again she skipped through the garden, she could smell flowers...and, and ice cream. She was sure she could smell ice cream.</p>
<p>She remembered going to a carnival with her father, he had bought her ice cream. That was before her dad forgot she existed.</p>
<p>Soon she was floating in a bubble. Looking down at the garden from above.</p>
<p>That was when she saw Faith. Buffy couldn't understand why she looked so worried, it was safe. The bubble was safe.</p>
<p align="center">----------------------Outside--------------------------</p>
<p>Faith had knocked on the door several times and nobody had answered.</p>
<p>"Time for more drastic measures" Faith said aloud, and kicked the door in.</p>
<p>She was just in time to see Buffy slide a hypodermic needle into her arm.</p>
<p>What was in the needle? Could it have been...no.</p>
<p>'There is no way Buffy would ever do that...but she had, hadn't she?'</p>
<p>Faith ran to her side. The high had taken her over and Buffy was no longer Buffy. She was an empty shell, with her mind and spirit somewhere completely different.</p>
<p>Faith had seen what heroin could do. She had watched as her mom injected herself too many times. Horrible memories came flooding back. She pushed them out. She had to help Buffy.</p>
<p>Faith started to shake the frail form of what was once a strong and proud slayer.</p>
<p>"You're better than me remember? You don't do stuff like this. You're strong!! C'mon B! Don't let this happen."</p>
<p>"Faith? It's ok we're up so high I know but it's ok cause the bubble saves us see look around and you can feel what I know! See?"  Buffy babbled incoherently.</p>
<p>"Shit B! This can't happen."</p>
<p>Faith looked over at the table and saw the other syringes and the powder strewn about, the telltale empty bottle lay on it's side.</p>
<p>She looked back at Buffy.</p>
<p>The blonde slayer was now standing and looking at Faith with fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>"What do you want? Why...why are you here?"</p>
<p>"B...Buffy? I want to help you."</p>
<p>"Who are you? I don't need help, nothing is wrong with me..."</p>
<p>"Buffy...It's me Faith. I'm your friend I want to help you."</p>
<p>"I don't know any Faith's. There is no Faith....get away I don't have any money...a vampire. That's it your a vampire."</p>
<p>"BUFFY! I'm Faith. I'm not a vampire I just want to help you."</p>
<p>In her drugged state it was hard for Buffy to be quick. Nonetheless she pushed past Faith and ran up to her room.</p>
<p>Faith was close behind, she could have easily stopped Buffy at any time but chose not to, she wanted to help her not scare her and make her do something irrational.</p>
<p>Buffy went over to her drawers and pulled out a stake.</p>
<p>"I...I can kill you. That's my job, I kill stuff...I even killed...I killed Faith! I know Faith! I killed her! You can't be Faith!"</p>
<p>Buffy charged her with the stake but Faith easily dodged it and gently knocked the stake away.</p>
<p>"Buffy, listen to me now. I have to get you back to the hospital before something bad happens ok?"</p>
<p>"No way. I'm not going anywhere with you."</p>
<p>Buffy ran to her window and jumped out, falling to the ground and knocking herself unconscious.</p>
<p>"FUCK!" Faith yelled and ran to the window and jumped out after her.</p>
