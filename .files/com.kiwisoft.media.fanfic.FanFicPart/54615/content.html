<!-- In Healing Arms \ Part Two -->

<p>The flight into Chicago was a quiet ride. Alex sat next to a very
			quiet Sydney on the airplane. They exited into Chicago's O'Hare Airport and immediately
			Alex felt exhuberated at being home again. Sydney remained quiet, other than basic small
			talk with Alex, as they waited for their luggage. Alex was really worried about Sydney
			since she hadn't said much since they left Edna in Montana.</p>

		<p>"Syd, honey, are you sure that everything is alright? You
			haven't said more than two words since we boarded the plane."</p>

		<p>"Of course Alexandra, I am fine." She lied as she thought about the last time
			she was inside an airplane. </p>

		<p>Syd was on her way from Sydney to the USA with her love Sharon
			Harris. This was supposed to be the next step towards her eternal happiness with her
			partner. Too bad Sharon's extracurricular love life took precedence over a longtime
			commitment. Syd shivered at the thought of Sharon and what she sacrificed for her. She
			swore she wouldn't let this bother her relationship with Alex, but right now it was all
			too familiar. Sydney knew that Alex was going to ask her soon about what was bothering
			her. She just had to build up the strength to share the pain that she had never voiced to
			another person other than Sharon. Least of all one that she was completely in love with.
			She knew that she loved Alex, but every fiber in her being was scared to death of sharing
			that information with her lover. Once she did that, she would be setting herself up for
			heartbreak. She couldn't handle that kind of pain ever again.</p>

		<p>"There's Tracey Syd, come on!! " Alex said excitedly as
			she saw her longtime friend waving from the arrival drive up. </p>

		<p>"Tracey!!!" Alex screamed with joy as she embraced her
			friend.</p>

		<p>"Hey girlfriend!! God I have missed you. Let me look at you." She said as she
			outstretched their entwined arms and looked at her jovial friend. "And who do we have
			here?" She asked as she looked Sydney up and down in appreciation.</p>

		<p>"Tracey Miller meet the love of my life, Sydney Thompson.
			Sydney this is Tracey." Alex introduced.</p>

		<p>"Hello Tracey, Alexandra has spoken so highly of you. It is
			a pleasure to finally meet you." Syd said politely as she outstretched her hand.
			Tracey shook it and marveled in the strength she felt within it.</p>

		<p>"Right back atcha. It is a pleasure to meet the woman that
			has stolen the heart of my best friend. I can see why she finally switched teams."
			She wiggled her eyebrows and nudged Alex as she batted away Alex's poking finger. Syd
			smiled courteously and shifted uncomfortably.</p>

		<p>"Shall we get going? We don't want to fall into traffic on
			I90, the tollway is a bitch this time of day if we don't get moving." Tracey
			explained as she started putting their bags into her trunk of her car.</p>

		<p>"Oh God, I don't miss the traffic around here, that's for
			sure. Yeah let's go." Alex agreed and took Sydney's hand and both got into the car.
			Syd took the backseat as Alex took the front.</p>

		<p>"So how was the flight?" Tracey inquired.</p>

		<p>"It wasn't too bad actually, thank God, I hate flying. I'm
			sure Syd's hands are still sore from the landing."</p>

		<p>"I think the blood has finally returned, don't worry about it hon." Syd smiled
			and patted her lover's shoulder from the backseat.</p>

		<p>Tracey and Alex chuckled at Syd's agreement of Alex's dislike of
			flying. They made small talk until they reached the end of Alex's street and Alex could
			feel her nerves set in like a stampede of horses over her body. The sweat beaded on her
			brow and without words Syd reached her hand over the seat and next to the window to softly
			caress Alex's shoulder. She moved to the edge of her seat to reach Alex's ear to whisper
			to her.</p>

		<p>"You are gonna be great sweetheart, I'm right here for you.
			If you want to cry, it's OK, my shoulder will be right here for you." Syd comforted
			while Tracey tried not to overhear the sweet reassurances between Alex and her new lover.
			Alex's reached up and squeezed Syd's hand in thanks and was never so grateful to have
			someone in her life like Sydney, as she was right now. She felt a wave of warmth swept
			through her as they entered her driveway. She instantly felt her parents with her and
			hoped they would stay with her until her stay was over. </p>

		<p>"Wow Alexandra, your home is beautiful. You never mentioned
			how expansive the landscape was. God it reminds me of home. This is just gorgeous."</p>

		<p>"Thanks sweetheart, yeah, mom loved this house and it took dad almost ten years to
			realize what he had. He didn't want to move here, but mom loved the area. It's very
			private and quiet. A lot like Eddi's except we don't have horses. We have a pool though, I
			think you'll enjoy your stay here. Wink wink." Alex joked as Tracey put the car in
			park in front of the garage. Syd smiled and stepped out of the car and took a deep breath
			and was pleased that their travels were over for now.</p>

		<p>Syd looked over the two story Victorian house and was in awe of
			its beauty. They all grabbed the bags from the luggage and after Alex found her key to the
			house, they entered her childhood home.</p>

		<p>"Smells musty, I'm going to open some windows as soon as we
			get our bags upstairs." Alex said while walking towards the stairs.</p>

		<p>Syd noticed her lover's slow glances around the quiet home and
			watched her facial expression change from indifference to a complete sadness as she walked
			up the steps.</p>

		<p>"Hey Sydney, I gotta get back to work. I think she's gonna need you right about now.
			Tell her I'll be back later on tonight, okay?" Tracey said.</p>

		<p>"Sure Tracey, I think it'll take a bit of getting used to
			for her to be here without her parents. I'll let her know you'll be back." She
			responded.</p>

		<p>"Thanks for being here for her Syd, she's very lucky."</p>

		<p>"I'm the lucky one, Tracey." Syd corrected.</p>

		<p>"Alright then. I'll see you later. It was great to meet you.
			You have a great accent, did you know that?" Tracey smiled.</p>

		<p>Syd rolled her eyes and smiled. "I don't have an accent, you
			do!! What is it with you women?" Syd and Tracey laughed as Syd walked Tracey to the
			door.</p>

		<p>After she led Tracey out, she walked upstairs and tried to guess
			which room Alex would have gone to. There were several rooms upstairs to choose from. She
			sat and listened to see if she could hear where Alex had gone. She listened closely and
			found Alex in what she assumed was her parents bedroom. She was sitting on their bed
			holding a picture of her parents that she took from the nighttable. She just stared at it
			while stroking their faces with her finger.</p>

		<p>"Hey." Syd softly spoke.</p>

		<p>"Hey." Alex pushed out before she let the tears loose
			that she had been holding in since she walked into the house.</p>

		<p>"Hey, come here." Syd put her arms around Alex's
			shoulders and pulled her to an embrace. Syd felt Alex's sobs wrack her body and held onto
			her and decided that she would stay like this until Alex needed otherwise.</p>

		<p>"God I miss them so much Sydney." Alex sobbed.</p>

		<p>"I know honey, I know. Shhh I'm here, I gotcha. Let it all
			out baby, I'm right here." Sydney soothed.</p>

		<p>"I'm so glad you're here Sydney, God I love you." Alex
			said before she could stop herself. She felt Sydney's heartrate increase rapidly but said
			nothing.</p>

		<p>"I know you do...." Syd said continuing to console her
			lover. She knew that Alex heard her gasp at the revelation of Alex's love for her. It's
			not like she didn't know, it just hit hard hearing it for the first time. She wasn't sure
			if she ever wanted to hear anyone say that to her ever again. If love meant the treatment
			that she got from Sharon, than she wanted no part of it. She found herself in a very bad
			situation emotionally. She wanted to run away, but she knew that Alex needed her more than
			ever right now. So for Alex, she endured.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>An hour or so later Alex had finished giving Sydney the nickel
			tour of her home. Syd was amazed at the size of the house and why Alex hadn't mentioned
			before that her family was wealthy.</p>

		<p>"My father was a Psychologist and
			<i>he</i> had money. I
			mean I'm only twenty years old, well I will be in a week or so. I never thought of myself
			as wealthy because I didn't earn a substantial living. Hopefully my journalism degree will
			change that, and with the money they left me, I may have a chance at finding out what
			making a good living is all about." Alex explained.
		</p>

		<p>"I have no doubt of your writing talent. Um, back up a sec,
			did you say you would be turning twenty in a week.?" Syd questioned.</p>

		<p>"Yeah September twenty-first. I'll be twenty, almost
			legal." She smiled and nudged Sydney.</p>

		<p>"Like I was worried. Well fair is fair, I will be
			twenty-five in April."</p>

		<p>"You know, I never asked you how old you were. I guess it really didn't matter to me,
			but now that I know, I should have guessed that we were close in age. You don't look a day
			over twenty-four." Alex said playfully.</p>

		<p>"Oh thank you, may I take that as a compliment?" She
			retorted.</p>

		<p>"You can do whatever it is that you like."</p>

		<p>"Oh really? Anything?"</p>

		<p>"Should I be afraid now?" Alex said as she backed up a few steps as Sydney
			prowled closer to her.</p>

		<p>"Oh, definitely, be very afraid Alexandra." Sydney
			purred as she swept Alex into a soaring kiss that knocked Alex's knees from under her. Syd
			caught Alex and held her tightly until their kiss tapered off.</p>

		<p>"That was incredible. God, did you learn that from
			somewhere?"</p>

		<p>Chuckling, "I'm glad that you liked that. You kiss quite lovely yourself."</p>

		<p>"Oh thank you my dear." She said bowing to her partner.</p>

		<p>They moved upstairs and began to unpack some of their things. The
			window in Alex's room had been opened and Sydney took the opportunity to look out into
			their backyard. She took in a breath of fall air coming in from the screen and exhaled
			softly. </p>

		<p>"You know, one of these days, I think I will take you home
			to Sydney. I think you'd love it there. It's very quiet, much like the ranch, but my God,
			it is gorgeous." Syd turned to look at Alex's loving gaze.</p>

		<p>"You miss home don't you?" Alex asked softly.</p>

		<p>"Mmhmm, very much. I haven't been home in what....six years?
			You would love my brother Tim, he is such a clown. I thought that he would decline my
			offer of the sheep station when I was deciding to leave Australia, but he didn't. He was
			excited to have a part of my family in his life." Sydney paused but Alex just waited
			and listened. Sydney rarely spoke of her past and she wasn't going to butt in now.</p>

		<p>"He says that things are going well and I would be happy
			with the way he was running things. I'm sure I would be. He taught me everything I needed
			to know, well everything that my dad didn't." She smiled. "Anyway, when
			Shar....when I decided to leave home I never thought I would miss it so much. So I can
			understand why you miss home so much." She still had a hard time even speaking
			Sharon's name. Alex didn't miss the slip and she hoped there would be more of them on
			their vacation together. Hopefully this trip would open up Sydney to Alex and she would
			finally understand the pain in the older woman's heart. "It's the part of you that is
			the most you. Does that make any sense? I mean just being here for little over an hour, I
			see so much of you in this house."</p>

		<p>"Really? You can see that just from being here?"</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah. The warmth of the decor of your bedroom is so you. The openness and
			brightness of your reading room is unmistakably you. There are just so many little things
			I see in this house that are you."</p>

		<p>"Wow, you are really incredible Sydney. I truly mean that." She said almost
			telling her how much she loved her again. She decided that a hug would suffice for now.
			She walked up to Sydney and wrapped her arms around the taller woman's body.</p>

		<p>"Mmm I like it here. I like you here too." Syd said as
			she ran her fingers through Alex's silky golden hair. She ran her hand up and down Alex's
			back unconsciously and Alex let out a moan of content bringing a smile to Syd's lips.</p>

		<p>"It's still pretty warm and musty in here don't you
			think?" Syd nodded and released Alex's hold. </p>

		<p>Alex walked through the living room, dining room, family room, kitchen, study, and sunroom
			opening every window imaginable, letting in as much air into the stuffy old house as
			possible.</p>

		<p>Alex found Syd sitting on the leather sofa in the family room in
			deep thought. She didn't want to pry but she really wanted Sydney to open up to her.
			'Soon, I hope.' Alex thought to herself.</p>

		<p>"So Syd, when did Tracey say that she would be back?"</p>

		<p>"Ahh, she said that she had to go back to work and that she'd be back later on
			tonight. She wasn't really specific with the time."</p>

		<p>"Hmm, I wonder if she wants to do dinner with us this evening." She checked her
			watch and realized that she was still on Montana time. She moved her watch forward and
			then saw that it was close to meal time "technically". "Did you remember to
			change your watch? I almost forgot." Alex said nonchalantly as she fixed her
			watchstrap.</p>

		<p>"Yes I did already. I did it on the plane, I didn't want to
			get screwed up later on." Syd replied. "So Alex? When do we get to try out that
			pool of yours?"</p>

		<p>"You get a sudden urge to go swimming or something?"</p>

		<p>"Maybe........" She said with a bit of a grin on her face.</p>

		<p>"I'll have to see if the pool was set up for the summer. I
			don't know if it was even filled this year. So much was going on when I came home, I
			didn't even notice. Let's go out back and check, you'll love it out there. Dad had the
			best garden, he had the most beautiful roses, I wonder if he planted any before....."
			She trailed off as Syd softly caressed her cheek.</p>

		<p>"Let's go see." She said as she kissed the top of
			Alex's head. She took Alex's arm and walked out into the patio and then out to the pool
			area. </p>

		<p>There they were as beautiful as Alex remembered. There were rows
			and rows of roses in the garden adjacent to their fence. Syd just marveled at Alex's face
			when she saw them. She took a look for herself and was amazed at their beauty.</p>

		<p>"My God they are gorgeous. You were so right. Your father
			definitely had a green thumb. I don't think I have ever seen roses like that before."
			Syd said in awe.</p>

		<p>"I don't think you'll ever see any like this anywhere. He
			truly made it an art." Alex explained proudly.</p>

		<p>There was still a cover on the pool and Alex walked into the pool
			shed and opened the door to flip a switch. With a click the electronic pool cover slid
			open and revealed a full swimming pool. Alex looked up at Sydney and smiled.</p>

		<p>"I bet I know who is responsible for this."</p>

		<p>"Edna?"</p>

		<p>"None other. I bet she called ahead and had the service come and take care of this.
			She is too much. We have to remember to call her tonight and thank her."</p>

		<p>"Absolutely, she is such a wonderful woman Alex. You are very lucky to have her as a
			part of your family."</p>

		<p>"She's your family too Syd. I know Eddi thinks of you as
			family. She has said so many times. I think you are the daughter she never had. I always
			hoped that I was that girl, but I really think that she feels that way about you. She
			loves you, you know."</p>

		<p>"Yeah I do, she is one in a million. She took me in after Sharon and I split
			up..." Syd realized a second too late that she had mentioned her ex's name to Alex
			for the first time. Alex tried to control the excitement of Sydney's disclosure of her
			name. She played it off coolly not wanting this conversation to end. Syd's body had panic
			running rampantly throughout it after she slipped up. "Anyway, she really helped to
			get my head together. I will be forever grateful to her for that."</p>

		<p>"That's our Eddi, she will stop at nothing to help people in need. That is just in
			her make-up and I would never change that about her. God, I miss her already!" Alex
			laughed at herself.</p>

		<p>"With me here? What am I, chopped steak?"</p>

		<p>"Liver honey, chopped liver."</p>

		<p>"Ew, I hate liver, I would much rather be steak."</p>

		<p>"I love steak, it's the most delectable of meats I think. I could eat steak all the
			time." Alex said in her most sexy voice.</p>

		<p>"Really? I think you do get your share of steak..... don't you think Alexandra?"
			She purred playing along with their analogy.</p>

		<p>"You can never have enough steak, especially when it tastes
			as good as it does." Alex said seductively enjoying the playfulness of Sydney.</p>

		<p>"You like the flavor........ you like the juice when you poke your fork into it for
			your first bite. The anticipation of the dripping morsel onto your taste buds......it's
			intoxicating isn't it?" She rumbled into Alex's ears sending her into fits of
			arousal.</p>

		<p>"Yes it is......and it's a good thing that I am not a
			vegetarian. Don't you think?" She gulped as she saw the dark desire forming in her
			lover's eyes.</p>

		<p>"Yes I do........come here Alexandra........I need to kiss
			you....." Syd commanded in soft humming tones.</p>

		<p>Alex moved within reach of Sydney's lips and slowly pressed hers
			against Syd's. The passion from one kiss was astounding to Alex and she wanted Syd to take
			her right then and there when she heard someone clearing their throat behind them.</p>

		<p>Looking up startled. "Tracey!! My God you scared the hell
			outta me!!" She screamed at a smiling curly headed blonde.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, you looked scared......hey Syd, how are ya?"</p>

		<p>"Fine thanks, you?" She said trying to hide the blush she felt creeping up her
			neck. </p>

		<p>"I am well. Damn hungry though, you guys up for pizza?"</p>

		<p>"God Tracey is that all you still eat?"</p>

		<p>"Hey it's a fine meal, if I do say so myself. You have eaten plenty of them with me
			if my memory serves correctly."</p>

		<p>"Haha I know. You know Trace.......you could take us to the bar tonight, if you
			wanted." She wiggled her eyebrows at Tracey who in turn raised hers high into her
			forehead.</p>

		<p>"THE BAR?? You want to go there? God I never thought I would
			see the day!! Man Syd, I don't know what you have done to her, but I like the
			results."</p>

		<p>"Hey! I went to plenty of bars at school. I just never wanted to go to a gay bar
			before. Now I think I would love to enter a club on the arm of this beauty." Alex
			winked at Syd whose body immediately reacted to the comment.</p>

		<p>"Umm, could you two excuse me...?" She said as she
			practically ran up to the house.</p>

		<p>"What was that about?" Tracey asked. </p>

		<p>Alex just shrugged her shoulders, "I have no idea. Excuse me
			Trace, would you? I really want to know what is bugging her. She has been so strange since
			we left Montana. I'll be back in a few. Sorry hon. " She said as she squeezed her
			friends forearm and ran up to the house in search of her love.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Sydney ran into the house and quickly found the powder room to heave her guts out. Her
			body was shaking from the stabbing pain in her gut. 'She's not Sharon, Sydney, she's not
			Sharon. She wouldn't treat me like a prop. She's not like that!!' Her head was saying in a
			mantra. Her body continued to tremble as another wave of nausea hit her hard. This was
			going to be a long night indeed.</p>

		<p>Alex ran into the house shouting Syd's name and got no response.
			Only after seeing Syd's pale face exit from the powder room did she calm her bellowing.</p>

		<p>"Syd, honey, are you ill? You look so pale." She ran up
			to Syd and rested the back of her hand to her cheek. "You are warm, come on and sit
			down in here." Alex said as she walked Syd back to the couch. "Relax a bit. I'll
			get you some water." She caressed Syd's ashen face and went into the kitchen to
			retrieve a glass of water.</p>

		<p>Tracey came back into the house and saw Sydney on the sofa in the
			family room. Her head was resting on the armrest of the sofa and she looked as if she was
			crying. Tracey heard Alex in the kitchen and decided to find her first.</p>

		<p>"Hey Alex, is Syd okay? She looks like she's crying over
			there." She said sympathetically.</p>

		<p>"I don't know Trace. Do you mind if we take a raincheck
			tonight? I think she has air sickness or flu or something. She just came out of the powder
			room and she looked like she had just gotten sick." She explained.</p>

		<p>"Sure babe. Tomorrow is Friday anyway, maybe we could go to
			the bar then, I mean if you guys are up to it."</p>

		<p>"OK Trace, thanks hon. I have lots of packing to do here, and hopefully I will get
			lots done during the day so we can play after dark!!" She said as she smiled at her
			friend.</p>

		<p>"I have missed you girl." Tracey said as she hugged her
			buddy.</p>

		<p>"Me too Trace, have a good night."</p>

		<p>"You too hon." </p>

		<p>"I have a feeling though, it's gonna be a long night."</p>

		<p>"Well hopefully not too long. You look like you could use
			some sleep. Those eyes of yours need some shuteye."</p>

		<p>"Yeah I know. I haven't been sleeping all that well as of late. I was hoping that
			coming home would cure me of my night demons. I have bad dreams all the time. Syd usually
			cuddles me close and then I usually calm down. We call it "The Exorcism"."
			She laughed as she enunciated the words while using her hands to mime quotation marks.</p>

		<p>"God you guys are sickening. I'm glad you are happy though
			Alex. She is gorgeous! And my God how do you not feint with that accent calling out your
			name?? Don't tell me she doesn't. I know my talks with you taught you something!!!"</p>

		<p>"Christ Tracey!!" Laughing, "Although it took awhile not to blush whenever
			I heard my name called that's for sure, but I will never tire of it. Not from that mouth
			or with that voice. God she could melt butter with that voice." She said proudly.
			"Speaking of meltdowns, I think I need to get back to her. See you tomorrow?"</p>

		<p>"You bet babe, nite." Tracey said as she kissed Alex's cheek and left to go
			home. Before she left, she waved good-bye to Syd and bid her a goodnight as well.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex returned to Sydney's side with her water. She gave the her
			the glass and watched her pale partner slowly drink the contents. She sighed softly and
			then looked into Alex's eyes.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry honey. I guess I am just not feeling that well. I
			don't like to fly, and maybe it finally got to me." She lied with a sincere smile.</p>

		<p>"That's alright sweetie, just lay here." She shifted so
			Sydney could lay on the couch with her head resting on Alex's thigh. She stroked Syd's
			long dark hair and started to knead the knots from her neck and shoulders. She could
			instantly feel the stress from within Sydney.</p>

		<p>"God Syd, you are so stiff and balled up with tension. Are
			you sure that you are okay?" Alex asked hoping that Syd would finally open up to her.</p>

		<p>"Yeah baby, I'm feeling better just being here with you.
			Sorry your first night home turned into a bust." Syd said sleepily.</p>

		<p>"Spending time with my best girl is never a bust in my eyes." She said outloud.
			'I love you, you big goof.' She wished she could say out loud. "There isn't anything
			I wouldn't do for you Sydney. I hope you know that."</p>

		<p>"Mmhhmmm" Sydney said as she fell off into a restless rest.</p>

		<p>Alex continued to rub Syd's head as she felt her body completely
			relax and her breathing deepened. She just sat there and held her love trying to soothe
			whatever demons may have invaded Syd's soul. She shifted a little and felt Syd's grip on
			her legs tighten. </p>

		<p>"Shhh, don't worry love, I'm not going anywhere. I love you
			Sydney. You don't know how hard it is for me not to tell you that." She began
			whispering to her slumbering companion while rubbing her head. "You have helped me so
			much in the last few months. You have helped me to deal with the biggest loss in my life.
			When my parents were killed, I never wanted to know love again. I didn't want to hurt like
			that ever again, and loving you sets me up for that. I don't care though, you brought out
			the person in me that I was afraid to know was there. I was afraid of knowing the person
			inside of me because I knew I was different. You showed me that loving a woman is no
			different than the love my father showed my mother. I know who I am for the first time in
			my life. I'm not afraid of the future because I know that I'll have you at my side. It
			just makes me sad that you don't tell me what is bothering you so much. I know it's about
			that woman you used to be with, you just need to tell me. You know whatever you say to me
			won't change the way I feel about you, nothing will. I just know that whatever it is that
			she did to you, will make me feel that much more sorry for her. She lost her chance with
			you, and you're mine now. It's bad enough I can't even compliment you without you thinking
			that's all I love about you. God you aren't a trophy or a possession. Sydney you are a
			gorgeous woman, that is just the facts. Your physical beauty, though, doesn't even compare
			to the woman you are to me." Alex sighed and wiped a stray tear from her cheek.
			"I love you baby, I love you with all of my heart." Alex finished as she leaned
			her head back into the couch. </p>

		<p>Sydney lay her in lap with one teary eye opened not knowing what
			to say to Alex. 'Do I let her know that I heard most of what she said? Or do I lay here
			and pretend to be asleep? God she is the most wonderful person I have ever known. She has
			a heart that parallels no other. I do love you Alexandra, I just wish I knew how to say it
			again. Those words have hurt so many. I want them to be more than just words, especially
			with the love I feel for you. I really hoped that I would have forgotten about Sharon,
			because I never wanted to talk about her again. I hope that you never meet her, I would
			hate it if she tried to hurt you. She hurt me really badly, and I never want you two in
			the same room together. Even if she is only here in conversation. I promise I will tell
			you everything, I just need the courage, help me find that courage Alexandra. Only you can
			help me to find that strength. I just hope it's not too late by the time it arrives. I
			couldn't bear the thought of losing you. Ever.' Sydney mused to herself as she
			nonchalantly shifted in her "sleep" to wipe her tear stained face.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex awoke to find Sydney gone from her lap and the couch. She
			got up and stretched to go find her lover. She walked into the kitchen and the room was
			dark. She managed to turn on the lights in the hallway and walked up the stairs. She found
			her bathroom door closed and heard the shower turn off. A smile came to her face as she
			approached the door. She tapped lightly on the door.</p>

		<p>"If you are a 5'4" blonde haired beauty you may enter.
			If not please go away, my girlfriend will be up soon." Sydney said as she grabbed a
			towel and began to dry herself off. </p>

		<p>The door opened up and the chill air ran up her semi-wet naked
			form. Syd grabbed Alex and quickly ushered her inside to close the door. She embraced Alex
			in a full bear hug and relaxed when she felt the smaller woman's hands on her.</p>

		<p>"When did you wake up honey?"</p>

		<p>"A couple of hours ago. Did you have a good rest?"</p>

		<p>"Mm, yeah I did. I didn't even know I was tired. Must have been the traveling. I'm
			going to be up all night now." She pouted.</p>

		<p>"Ooh, I hope so. I would hate to think that I would be up
			all by myself in this big house. I may get scared." She joked around. "Besides,
			I have a surprise for you."</p>

		<p>"A surprise? For me? Why? What did I do?"</p>

		<p>"You are just you, baby, that's why." She smiled and looked at their hugging
			reflection in the mirror.</p>

		<p>"Well where is it?"</p>

		<p>"It's downstairs, you want to see it?"</p>

		<p>"Sure in a sec. First I want to know if you are feeling better. Your coloring is so
			much better."</p>

		<p>"I feel one hundred percent better sweetheart, and it is because of you and your TLC.
			Thanks for taking care of me."</p>

		<p>"Aww sweetie, it was no big deal. I like taking care of you. I hope to do it for a
			long time." She sweetly smiled.</p>

		<p>"Me too. I'm hungry, let's go downstairs."</p>

		<p>"Ohhh, the surprise is food related?"</p>

		<p>"How else would I thank you appropriately? Food is like gold to you babe."</p>

		<p>"Got that right. Lead the way!!" She said excitedly.</p>

		<p>Syd grabbed a T-shirt and shorts from their room and lead Alex
			downstairs. She lead Alex through the sunroom and out towards the pool.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney....." Alex gasped at the sight in front of
			her.</p>

		<p>The perimeter of the pool was illuminated by candlelight. Syd had
			set up a table with several entrees of Alex's favorite delicacy, Chinese food.</p>

		<p>"Sydney, how did........this is beautiful. How did you do
			this without me knowing?"</p>

		<p>"I found the keys to one of the cars in the garage, found a phonebook, and I am not
			above asking for directions." She smiled triumphantly.</p>

		<p>"You are incredible! Thank you so much, God you are so
			thoughtful." Alex said as she captured Sydney's lips in a deep sensual kiss.</p>

		<p>"Mmm, you are so welcome. I know that you wanted to spend
			your first night with Tracey, so I wanted to make up for it somehow." She guiltily
			said.</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, you don't have to make up for being sick, it
			just happened. Don't think that you had to make up for that."</p>

		<p>"Alex....I........I....." Sydney softly began.</p>

		<p>"What Sydney?" Alex asked.</p>

		<p>"Nothing, I just wanted to tell you that I am really happy
			you brought me here." She said as she released a breath she didn't know she was
			holding.</p>

		<p>"Me too sweetie, I am so glad that you are here with me. Are
			you hungry?" Alex excitedly asked.</p>

		<p>"Sure, let's hit it. Now remember, no swimming for at least
			an hour after eating."</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney, I think they have pushed it down to a half hour now." She answered
			mischievously. She sat down and started spooning little portions of everything that Sydney
			ordered for them. "Ooh can you pass me an egg roll?"</p>

		<p>Laughing, "You know it still is such entertainment for me to watch you eat. Between
			you and your aunt, I think I have found the two most adoring eaters on the planet. It is
			really something to watch." She said as she put a forkful of Cashew Chicken in her
			mouth. "Mmm this is good." She mumbled.</p>

		<p>"Mmhhmm it is. Oh you got to try the Shrimp and Pea Pods,
			God, I have missed this place. They just don't have this in Montana. So um, did you
			venture around town?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah I did a little, I didn't want to go too far without a chaperone." Syd
			jokingly replied.</p>

		<p>"Did you like Market Square? Isn't like a little town of
			make believe?" Alex inquired.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, it was like.....what was that guy's name who had a
			children's show on television here in the States, a Mr. Robinson, or someone?"</p>

		<p>Laughing, "Ha, I think you mean Mr. Roger's. Yeah, he had a show for kids, Mr.
			Roger's Neighborhood. It was one of my favorite shows as a kid. But I see your point, it
			is a little like that. You should see it around Christmas, they really do a wonderful job
			with lights all over every single tree in the square."</p>

		<p>"Even the huge one near the fountain?"</p>

		<p>"Especially that one. It's really something to see."</p>

		<p>"You know what?" Sydney asked as she was staring at her lover.</p>

		<p>"Hmm?" Alex replied in between bites.</p>

		<p>"You looked about twelve years old just then. I don't think I have seen that look in
			your eyes before you spoke of Christmas. You are so adorable Alexandra."</p>

		<p>"You are just biased."</p>

		<p>"No I just call them as I see them.' She said as she winked at Alex.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Oh Sydney that was just wonderful, God it feels good to
			have food in my belly. I didn't want to eat too much, because I really want to get in the
			water. I don't remember September being this warm."</p>

		<p>"It seems a little out of season, but I agree it is quite warm out, it's so beautiful
			though. The sky is clear and you can see lots of stars, but you are right, you don't quite
			see as many as you do by Edna's." She said as she poured more wine for herself.</p>

		<p>"I am glad that you are feeling better. What do you suppose
			hit you? Air sickness?"</p>

		<p>"Well, whatever it was, I'm glad it decided to leave as quickly as it arrived."</p>

		<p>"Me too." She smiled as she gestured to Sydney to fill her glass as well.
			"You know, you could get arrested for aiding to the delinquency of a minor."</p>

		<p>"Yeah well I think they could arrest me for more than a drinking violation. Certain
			acts of love are illegal here in the States, no?"</p>

		<p>Thinking about what Syd said brought a flush of acknowledgment to what acts she was
			talking about.</p>

		<p>"You are so beautiful when you blush Alexandra. I am a lucky
			woman."</p>

		<p>"No Sydney, I am the lucky one." She leaned over and kissed her partner.</p>

		<p>"Mm, do you want to try the pool yet?" Sydney asked
			hopefully. "There is a little more to the surprise for this evening."</p>

		<p>"Oohh there's more? What could you possibly have done in two
			hours?"</p>

		<p>Sydney smiled innocently. </p>

		<p>"Should I be afraid?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, be very afraid. You left me on my own for a couple hours, be very afraid
			Alexandra." She purred in Alex's ear. Alex audibly gulped as she felt Sydney pull her
			to her feet.</p>

		<p>"I don't think you'll be needing these." Sydney
			seductively said as she began to remove Alex's shorts. Sydney pushed the unwanted clothing
			to Alex's feet followed by her underwear. The warm air felt wonderful on Alex's aroused
			skin. Syd slowly unbuttoned Alex's shirt as she kept eye contact with the smaller woman.
			She gently brought the garment over Alex's shoulders and down her arms, revealing well
			tanned, delectable skin that she needed to taste. After her shirt fell to the ground with
			the other items of clothing, she removed the final piece of apparel unleashing Alexandra's
			beautiful breasts.</p>

		<p>Sydney just stared at her lover as she gently cupped Alex's
			breasts and began to brush her thumbs across Alex's already erect nipples.</p>

		<p>"You are such a sensual person Sydney, I just love it. I
			never knew that making love could be this incredible. You never leave me wanting for more.
			You satisfy every need I thought I would ever have. Sometimes you satisfy wants that I
			didn't even
			<i>know</i> I had."
		</p>

		<p>"Good I am glad. I hope that you like what I have planned for you for tonight
			then." She said as she captured Alex's wanting mouth with her own. She let her tongue
			linger inside Alex's mouth as they exchanged gentle touches and caresses. Alex tugged on
			Syd's shorts and pulled away breathlessly from the kiss.</p>

		<p>"These have to go as well my sweet."</p>

		<p>"Oh that's not a problem, I want to feel your body against mine. I love the way our
			bodies feel when they are together. It's like we were made to fit perfectly with each
			other. We must have been considering the differences of our heights."</p>

		<p>"Mmmm I love your body and the way it feels. I bet it will feel even better in
			there." She said as she gestured to the water.</p>

		<p>"Come on, let's get wet."</p>

		<p>"Too late for that my little country mouse. I have already reached that point. I
			don't think I will ever have to worry about that being a problem as long as you are in my
			life." Sydney chuckled at Alex's admission.</p>

		<p>The two women slowly entered the candle lit pool by walking down
			the stairs in the shallow end. Alex held onto the metal railing as she stepped down
			letting the temperature of the water wash over her skin. Sydney dove under the water and
			came up like a goddess as the water cascaded down her tanned muscled form. Alex just
			watched Sydney like a child in awe of a phenomenon. The desire she felt right now
			challenged any emotion she had ever had, and won.</p>

		<p>Alex dove in towards her lover and surfaced in front of her. The
			taller woman wrapped her arms around the smaller form in front of her. Their bodies were
			warm and wet and glistened in the candlelight.</p>

		<p>"You know, the only other time I have been naked in this
			pool was with Tracey. We got drunk and went skinny dipping a couple summers ago. I thought
			that was fun. It doesn't even hold a candle to this....sorry, no pun intended."</p>

		<p>"You and Tracey huh? Should I be jealous?"</p>

		<p>"Oh God no, Tracey is my best friend. I think that sex is the only thing we haven't
			shared. Did I tell you that she was the one that told me I was gay? I thought she was just
			wishfully thinking aloud. She just knew me better than I knew myself. Still does
			sometimes. Other than you and Edna, I have never trusted someone, as I trust her. She is
			the best friend ever."</p>

		<p>"She seems like she really cares about you. I think I will like getting to know
			her." Syd said as she leaned over and gently nibbled on Alex's neck. She felt Alex's
			body shudder and she moved her lips over to Alex's throat and began to gently kiss and
			suckle at it.</p>

		<p>"Mm, no more talk about Tracey." Alex panted out as she
			claimed Syd's mouth again. Alex thrusted her tongue deep inside Syd's mouth. She felt
			feverish with the passion running through her body. Syd reached down and started massaging
			Alex's bottom and was rewarded with a hungry growl from Alex.</p>

		<p>"Oh yes Syd, God you are so incredible. I want you so badly
			right now." She gasped.</p>

		<p>"I know baby, me too. Come on, here's where the surprise
			comes into play, and I do mean play. Do you trust me?"</p>

		<p>"You know I do. What did you have in mind?" Alex asked while half of her was
			nervous, her other half was on fire.</p>

		<p>Syd took Alex's hand and led them back to the stairs leading out
			of the pool. She sat Alex down on the last step leaving her upper body exposed to her. She
			bent down to her knees and knelt between Alex's legs. Alex reached out and pulled Sydney
			into a lustful kiss. Their tongues battled for control inside their mouths while their
			bodies began to move against each other in a rhythm of desire. Syd leaned over and reached
			for the towel she had resting poolside. She opened the towel to reveal a pair of
			handcuffs. They separated from their kiss and Syd raised her eyebrow in question.</p>

		<p>"You game?" Syd asked as she dangled the cuffs from her
			finger.</p>

		<p>"Where did you want to cuff me to, the water?" Alex
			chuckled.</p>

		<p>"No, I thought this would serve us well." She clanged
			the cuffs against the railing next to the stairs.</p>

		<p>"Oh, um, I sense a well thought out plan. Remind me to leave
			you alone more often." She smiled seductively at her lover. </p>

		<p>Alex leaned back and reached up so her hands were on either side
			of the railing. Sydney reached over and locked the cuffs to each of Alex's wrists around
			the railing. She ladled some water in her hands and poured it slowly over Alex's breasts
			watching the droplets of water return to their origin. Alex's nipples were fully erect and
			Sydney found her mouth eager to taste them. She leaned into Alex's body and captured a
			nipple with her teeth and gently stroked it with her tongue eliciting a pleasurable moan
			from Alex. She looked up and found Alex's eyes closed and her mouth was open wide enough
			for her tongue to moisten her lips. Syd climbed a little further up Alex's body and
			whispered in her ear.</p>

		<p>"How far do you want to go?"</p>

		<p>"I'd go anywhere with you Sydney."</p>

		<p>"Alright. Then I want you to tell me how you feel about this." She smiled and
			lifted a candle and poured a little drop of wax on her palm and showed Alex. "You
			want to play with fire, scarecrow?" </p>

		<p>"Do it Sydney, you won't hurt me." Alex said
			confidently as she watched Syd raise the candle over her chest and painfully waited in
			anticipation as the wax slowly ran from the candle onto her chest. "Oooh......."
			She hissed.</p>

		<p>"Did that hurt you?" Syd asked sincerely.</p>

		<p>"No it feels really umm.........I don't know how to describe
			it, but it definitely didn't hurt."</p>

		<p>"The journalist doesn't know how to describe something?" She kidded.</p>

		<p>"You win this time Sydney, take it while you can."</p>

		<p>"How about I take you instead?" She purred as she let another few drops fall
			onto Alex's chest. A drop of wax rolled to her nipple before it hardened making Alex pull
			on her restrained arms. Her body was reacting to the stimulus with a ferocity she didn't
			expect. She was fully enjoying Sydney's little surprise. Another flow of the wax fell onto
			her and it landed directly on her nipple making her cry out. Sydney dripped some water
			from the pool on the same spot and the combination of hot and cold made Alex shudder with
			desire. </p>

		<p>Sydney drew patterns on her lover's chest and abdomen with the
			wax until she wanted to do much more than watch her lover squirm, she wanted to take Alex
			over the edge of reality. She wanted the screams, she needed to hear her name called into
			the heavens. She ladled more water over Alex's body and rubbed her chest until all the wax
			fell off her body. The exotic massage had Alex writhing with need. Sydney brought her
			hands lower to feel Alex's excitement. Not even the pool could wash away her lover's
			wetness. </p>

		<p>Syd played in Alex's folds of skin and slowly entered her with
			one teasing finger.</p>

		<p>"Oh sweet Jesus!!!!" Alex screamed out.</p>

		<p>Syd began to thrust slowly into her lover as her thumb stimulated
			Alex's clitoris. She added a finger to the assault and felt Alex's body grind into her.
			Her arms were pulling hard on the railing wanting to be free to pull Sydney into her. The
			excitement of the restraints was almost unbearable...almost.</p>

		<p>Syd slid down and raised Alex's legs over her shoulders. She
			leaned back pulling on Alex, making the rest of Alex's body buoyant. She kissed her inner
			thighs and looked into Alex's eyes knowing that it wouldn't take much to bring her to
			release. Sydney had never seen a more beautiful sight in her life. She leaned forward and
			licked Alex's sex from the base of her anus to the tip of her clitoris. Alex's body
			started squirming from the welcomed invasion. Her breath was coming in short pants and Syd
			heard her name coming from deep within Alex's throat. Her tongue rapidly moved against
			Alex's clit bringing her closer and closer to release. She drove her fingers deeper inside
			of Alex as she moved her tongue faster.</p>

		<p>"Oh my
			God....Sydney.......fuck..........I'm..........ooooooooohhh!!!" Alex shouted out as
			her release flooded through her body. She hung on to the railing as Sydney continued her
			assault on her body. Her body shook with every touch from Sydney's mouth and fingers. When
			Sydney knew her lover had had enough, she slowly lowered Alex's legs back into the water
			and pressed her body against her. Alex wrapped her head against Sydney's head and shoulder
			in an embrace.</p>

		<p>"Please....Sydney, can you take these off now? I need to
			hold you." Alex pleaded.</p>

		<p>"Yes sweetheart, of course." She reached up to the
			towel and found the key releasing Alex's spent arms. Alex brought her arms around Sydney's
			strong form and held her as tightly as she could.</p>

		<p>"My God Sydney, that was amazing." She whispered out.
			"The combination of everything was so exhilarating. You are really an incredible
			lover." She said softly as her emotions came over her and she began to cry.</p>

		<p>"Shh, it's OK sweetie, I've gotcha. Shhh. It was really
			wonderful for me too baby. To feel you lose all control like that, watching your
			expressions change, feeling your body finally giving in to me. Oh My God.....there is no
			other feeling like it. You are quite an astonishing lover yourself." She said as she
			gently kissed her lover's forehead.</p>

		<p>"I thank God everyday for bringing you to me. You are the
			most important thing in my life. I don't know what I would do if anything happened to
			you."</p>

		<p>"Let's not think about that. Hopefully we won't ever have to find that out." She
			squeezed Alex closer to her. "Let's think about something much happier, like your
			birthday."</p>

		<p>"What about my birthday?"</p>

		<p>"Is there anything special you want or want to do?"</p>

		<p>"I haven't really thought about it. I'm sure you'll think of something though. You, I
			have found out, are very resourceful." Alex smiled into Syd's strong embrace.</p>

		<p>'Yes I am, and believe me, between Tracey and I, you are going to
			have the best birthday ever, you just wait.' Syd thought as she felt Alex's smile against
			her.</p>
