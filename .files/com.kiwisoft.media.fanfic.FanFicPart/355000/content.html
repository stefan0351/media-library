<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 45: A Night to Last Forever -->

<p>The sound of the tumblers turning in the lock of their cell rang
		with the finality of a nail being pounded into a coffin. John had allowed their friends to
		stay until he absolutely had to lock down the prisoners for the night. He apologized
		repeatedly for having to imprison these women whom he had come to think of as friends
		himself, but they both reassured him that they bore no ill will toward him for doing the
		job he had been hired to do. Intuiting that they would prefer to share the same cell, he
		had moved the bunk from the empty cell into the one Josie had called home for the past
		several days.</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched as John walked through the door at the end of the
		hall, pulling it shut behind him with a click. Once again the sound of a key in a lock
		reminded her that this time she was not free to exit the cell if she chose to; she was as
		much a prisoner as Josie. The outlaw stepped up behind Rebecca where she stood looking out
		through the iron bars, and placing her hands on Rebecca?s shoulders she gently turned
		the smaller woman around to face her. Rebecca?s face was pale and drawn as if she had
		already spent years in confinement. The indomitable spirit that Josie had grown to love
		and depend on seemed to have fled; leaving the hollow ghost of itself behind in the
		fragile woman who stood before her.</p>

		<p>"I?m so sorry, sprite," she said softly, drawing
		Rebecca to her and wrapping her arms around her tiny waist. She could feel her heart
		fluttering in her chest like the wings of a bird as it always did at the nearness of this
		woman. A caged bird, she thought wryly. Josie would gladly have sold her soul to the devil
		to spare this gentle creature from the pain and indignity she was going through. But she
		had made such a bargain years ago in return for a pair of six guns, and had nothing left
		to barter with.</p>

		<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for, Josie. This is my fault!
		It?s all my fault!" Rebecca?s chin was trembling and her eyes welled with
		tears.</p>

		<p>"No it isn?t, Rebecca, you?"</p>

		<p>"Yes it is!" Rebecca wailed, unable to check the tears
		that poured down her face. "I handed you over to my fa?to Caleb just as surely
		as Judas gave Jesus to the soldiers. And he won?t be satisfied until he knows
		you?re d-dead!" She buried her face in Josie?s chest and sobbed
		uncontrollably while the outlaw stroked her hair and gently crooned into her ear.</p>

		<p>"Shhh, baby, don?t cry. I?m not dead yet.
		They?ll give me a fair trial in the states, not like this kangaroo court. Don?t
		give up, please. I need your strength." Her own voice quavered when she realized the
		truth of that statement. Rebecca was her anchor, her foundation. More than any other
		thing, Rebecca was the reason she wanted to live. To protect her, and to love her. If
		Rebecca stopped believing, Josie would be without hope.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Josie. I love you so much. I can?t?bear the
		thought of?going on without you?"</p>

		<p>"Then don?t think about it. There?s still some
		time before that train leaves. Who knows what might happen? We can?t give up on
		William. I need you to help me be strong, Rebecca. Please?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca looked up into cerulean eyes that begged for her to be
		the one to pull them both out of this predicament. She took a deep breath and gently
		touched her lips to Josie?s, and when she pulled away she smiled up at the outlaw and
		said softly, "You?re right. There is time before that train comes. And we
		can?t allow ourselves to waste it by wallowing in tears."</p>

		<p>Josie smiled back. "And how would you like to spend all that
		time, sprite?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, I can think of something I?d much rather wallow in
		than tears," she answered huskily, her fingers moving to the buttons of Josie?s
		shirt. Slowly she unfastened each button, her fingers brushing against the gradually
		exposed flesh of Josie?s breasts. Josie gasped and inhaled sharply as Rebecca pulled
		the tails of her shirt free and in the process inserted her fingers down the front of her
		pants to touch the crisp hair on the top of her mound. Rebecca put her hands under the
		fabric of the shirt and rolled if off Josie?s shoulders, her eyes feasting on the
		flesh she loved so well as it was slowly revealed. The hungry look in her eyes was enough
		in itself to make Josie?s nipples stiffen with anticipation.</p>

		<p>Rebecca leaned forward and touched her lips lightly to the valley
		between Josie?s breasts, her nose delighting in the musky scent of her lover.
		"You are the most beautiful woman on earth," she whispered as she tilted her
		head back to look into Josie?s face. With gentle pressure of her hand on the back of
		Josie?s head she brought their lips to within a breath of each other and then said
		softly, "I want you more than I have ever wanted anything in my life, Josie
		Hunter." Her lips met Josie?s and her tongue gently begged entrance to her
		mouth. With a groan Josie parted her lips to allow the caress, and met the inquisitive
		tongue with her own. She pulled the smaller woman closer and deepened the kiss, causing
		Rebecca to moan softly deep in her throat.</p>

		<p>When at last they separated Josie replied, "And I want
		nothing more than to spend the rest of my life loving you, Rebecca Cameron." Neither
		woman would allow herself to dwell on how brief that might be. "I?ve missed
		having you beside me these past nights. I can?t tell you how many times I reached out
		to touch you and found only empty space. I want to see you?touch you?feel
		you?taste you." Her fingers began to work the buttons of Rebecca?s dress,
		and while she was careful to avoid pulling them off, she did not take her time to remove
		the garment, so eager was she to behold what she had craved all those lonely nights.</p>

		<p>Josie slid the shirt waist dress down Rebecca?s arms and
		released the garment to settle on the floor at her feet. Reaching down she grasped the hem
		of her slip and in one quick movement she pulled it over her head, leaving Rebecca wearing
		only her panties and shoes. Josie dropped to her knees in front of Rebecca to untie the
		cord that held her panties in place, and that garment joined the rest on the floor. The
		sight of the red-gold curls and the warm scent so near to her made her want to bury
		herself between Rebecca?s legs that moment. But she was determined to take as much
		time as she could to tease and excite the younger woman before she finally brought her
		hands and mouth to the spot that so captured her attention. She ran her hand down
		Rebecca?s calf and put slight pressure on her ankle to indicate she should lift her
		foot, and when Rebecca complied she removed the shoe. She performed the same move on the
		other foot, and then stood up to take in the sight of all of Rebecca. For a moment she
		couldn?t breathe. Nothing she had beheld in her life gave her as much pleasure as the
		sight of this woman.</p>

		<p>"My turn," Rebecca growled. Her hands found the buttons
		that clasped the familiar black pants over Josie?s sensuous hips and pulled them
		apart. Josie trembled as Rebecca?s fingers once again brushed over her abdomen. The
		mere suggestion of a touch from this beloved woman was enough to make her heart race and
		her knees grow watery. Rebecca peeled the pants off Josie?s hips, taking her
		underwear with them. The clothes pooled at her calves, held up by her boots. "Sit
		down," Rebecca ordered, arching her brow. Without hesitation Josie dropped to the
		edge of the cot and Rebecca knelt in front of her. The little blonde grasped the heel and
		toe of first one boot and then the other, pulling them off quickly and tossing them aside.
		She ran her fingers over Josie?s well-muscled calves and shivered in anticipation of
		feeling those legs wrapped around her body. She drew the pants and underwear off, and they
		joined the growing pile of clothes occupying a large part of their small space.
		Fortunately they did not need much space, as they planned to be as close together as if
		they were one.</p>

		<p>Rebecca trailed her fingers up the inside of Josie?s thighs
		and delighted in watching the eruption of gooseflesh trailing her fingers. She avoided
		touching the soft curls that covered Josie?s mound, as she wanted to make the tall
		woman frantic with desire before giving her what she craved.</p>

		<p>"Something you want?" She asked in response to the soft
		moan Josie could not suppress. Rebecca?s lips covered the same trail her hand had
		blazed moments before, her chin just grazing the curls as she brought her lips to
		Josie?s belly.</p>

		<p>Josie was half reclining, supported by her hands which were out
		to her sides. She sat up when Rebecca began to run her tongue around her navel, and
		putting her hand under the younger woman?s chin she lifted her face so she could see
		her sparkling green eyes. "Ahhhh, yesss, there is. But first?" She put her
		hands on Rebecca?s waist and picked her up as if she weighed nothing. "Put your
		legs around me," she said in a commanding voice, and Rebecca obligingly parted her
		legs as the outlaw lifted her onto her lap. Josie had parted her own legs so that
		Rebecca?s mound was pressing against her own damp curls. Rebecca molded her body
		against the tall gunslinger, her breasts just reaching Josie?s ribcage. The feel of
		Josie?s breasts on top of her own and the warmth of her moist center commingling with
		that of her lover made Rebecca writhe and moan.</p>

		<p>Josie bent down to capture Rebecca?s lips. Her kiss was soft
		and slow at first, but soon both women were frantic in their need to feel and taste even
		more of each other. They broke apart, gasping, hearts racing at the same tempo.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I have to taste you?now."</p>

		<p>"Oh, but I?"</p>

		<p>"Please?let me?" Her voice was a husky growl,
		and it made Rebecca shiver to hear the need in it.</p>

		<p>"Yes, yes?you may, but I want to taste you too. Both of
		us; together."</p>

		<p>"Yesss." Josie lay on her back, and cupping the soft
		globes of Rebecca?s behind, she urged the younger woman to move up her body. As she
		did, the moist trail left by her lips made Josie even more frantic to run her tongue over
		those folds. Rebecca paused in her ascent and lowered her body onto Josie?s breast,
		effectively coating the tip with her juices. She could feel the nipple hardening against
		her nether lips, and she whimpered softly.</p>

		<p>"God, you excite me, Josie!" she said through clenched
		teeth as she continued to rub against Josie?s breast. Rebecca?s words and the
		warm wetness of her sliding over Josie?s body caused the outlaw to gasp.</p>

		<p>"You make me crazy, Rebecca? Please, give yourself to
		me."</p>

		<p>Rebecca moved further up until her mound was scant inches from
		Josie?s face. Josie wrapped her arms around Rebecca?s thighs and gently pulled
		downward until her knees spread far enough on either side of Josie?s head for her to
		reach the treasure she sought so desperately. The first touch of her tongue on the outer
		folds struck like lightning to the core of the smaller woman.</p>

		<p>"Oh, oh?" Rebecca groaned, nearly forgetting her
		resolve to taste Josie at the same time. She let Josie get enough of a taste to whet her
		appetite for more, and then abruptly rose up on her knees and shifted around so that she
		was facing toward Josie?s feet.</p>

		<p>The move was so quick it caught Josie off guard, something only
		Rebecca could do. By the time she realized Rebecca had withdrawn she was already back, her
		velvety folds once again tickling Josie?s lips and nose. Rebecca was lowering herself
		slowly onto the outlaw?s body, hungry for the taste of her center, but not wanting to
		miss any of the delights along the way. She tongued the underside of Josie?s breasts,
		which was all she could reach from that angle, but she vowed to come back and suckle them
		as soon as the raging desire to sip from her nectar had been quenched. She trailed her
		tongue over Josie?s abdomen and then dipped it into her navel. Josie?s stomach
		muscles tensed and Rebecca caressed the flesh there with one hand while holding herself up
		with the other. Her fingers slipped into the crease between Josie?s thigh and her
		mound, the warm scent intoxicating and pulling her further down. Lying full out on top of
		the outlaw Rebecca could only just touch the top of Josie?s mound of curls. Never
		having made love to her in this fashion, she did not realize that her shorter stature
		would not allow her to reach her intended goal without some assistance from Josie. She
		cupped her hands around Josie?s bottom and tried to lift, but the result only brought
		her a bit closer to where she wanted to be.</p>

		<p>"I can?t reach," she said petulantly, her
		frustration obvious in her voice. Josie chuckled, the sound muffled by the warm folds
		where her mouth was buried.</p>

		<p>She let Rebecca try reaching a few more times before she finally
		said, "I can fix that." Grasping Rebecca around her buttocks, Josie lifted them
		both up and then she maneuvered them on the narrow cot until they were side by side. One
		more shift put Rebecca on her back beneath the taller woman, whose mouth had never ceased
		it?s exploration the entire time they were moving.</p>

		<p>"Ohhhh," Rebecca moaned as the object of her desire was
		now tantalizingly in reach. She kissed the flesh of Josie?s inner thighs before
		running her tongue over each one in turn. Her tongue got closer and closer to her goal
		each time she moved from one leg to the other until finally she allowed herself to touch
		the rose colored lips lightly with her mouth. Josie shuddered at the contact and burrowed
		her face even deeper into Rebecca?s center.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was determined not to rush; she wanted to take her time
		and tease her lover until she begged for release. But even as she thought ?take it
		slow?, her mouth was taking its tempo from the woman above her, and Josie was
		building up speed. Rebecca pulled her mouth away from Josie?s lips for just a few
		moments, and when she touched her again with her tongue she consciously slowed her
		movements. It was enough to send a message to the outlaw.</p>

		<p>Josie had not realized what a pace she was setting until Rebecca
		subtly reminded her. She too had vowed to make this nights lovemaking last until both of
		them were taut as piano wire, but her resolve melted away with a touch of Rebecca?s
		tongue. Never in her life had she been so touched by another human being, and she nearly
		wept with joy that she had been given the last several months with this beautiful woman.
		Whatever the outcome of the trial in the states, she would not have traded one moment of
		the time they had spent together. Josie slowly and carefully parted Rebecca?s lips
		with her tongue, and then she ran it up one side and down the other, occasionally dipping
		inside to pull out some of the accumulating moisture there. She brushed over the knob that
		she knew would send Rebecca hurtling over the edge but was careful not to apply too much
		pressure too soon. She could not resist lightly grazing her teeth over the nub before she
		moved away and she could feel it harden with the tip of her tongue.</p>

		<p>Rebecca wanted to grind herself against Josie but fought the
		impulse knowing the signal that would send would put an end to this exquisite exchange.
		Instead she brought one arm from behind Josie?s thighs and placed her fingers against
		the folds of skin. She separated the folds to give her tongue greater access, and even as
		she lovingly caressed the soft lips she slid two fingers inside the moist cavern. Her
		other hand roamed over the soft contours of Josie?s buttock, delighting in the way
		Josie responded to her touch.</p>

		<p>Now it was Josie who wanted to thrust against Rebecca, and
		involuntarily she began to pick up the pace to match what her inner core wanted to receive
		from the little blonde. Rebecca picked up the tempo, ready to feel the explosion that was
		building inside her, and to pull the same from the woman she loved. She also sucked the
		hardening nub of flesh into her mouth as she built up momentum with her fingers, and she
		was rewarded by a gasp from Josie as the gunslinger stiffened her body and began to rise
		up off Rebecca?s body. The smaller woman clung to her to hold her within reach to
		prolong the delicious sensations.</p>

		<p>Josie could not have delayed her climax any longer if she had
		wanted to. Her one goal was to bring Rebecca to the edge at the same time so that they
		could plunge together. She tongued the bud that had risen from its hiding place and begged
		for attention. Faster she moved until she heard Rebecca cry out with the beginning of her
		orgasm. They both rose so high it seemed they must be hovering just under the ceiling,
		each sucking every bit of moisture from the other until they finally collapsed back on to
		the cot. Their breath came in labored gasps, and neither could move from where she lay,
		faces pillowed on each other?s thighs.</p>

		<p>When at last their hearts had slowed and they felt they could
		once again command their muscles to obey them they rearranged themselves so that Rebecca
		was lying full length on top of the gunslinger, her mouth inches away from a tantalizing
		nipple. She cupped the soft breast in her hand pulling it toward her mouth as she
		stretched out to meet it. She circled the brown ring with her tongue and felt it contract,
		the nipple hardening once again into a bullet. She tasted the essence of herself on
		Josie?s breast.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca?"</p>

		<p>"Hmmm?" The breast in her mouth muffled her response.</p>

		<p>"We need to?make a decision about what you should do
		while I?m gone, in case William does not show up in time." She tried to make it
		sound as if her being gone was only a temporary thing instead of the final chapter of her
		life. "I still think you should take the horses and wagon and go stay with Charles
		and Horace. They love you like a daughter, and god knows that place needs a woman?s
		touch."</p>

		<p>Rebecca raised her head to look into Josie?s eyes before she
		answered. "We?ve been over this. I already asked Charles to take the horses and
		wagon and he said he would, unless you try to prevent me from going with you on the train,
		in which case I will need the wagon to follow you. I am going with you. One way or
		another. You can?t shut me out of your life now, Josie. I?m your strength,
		remember?" A sheen of tears made her eyes sparkle like diamonds as she lightly traced
		the shape of Josie?s face with her fingers. She wanted to memorize every part of the
		woman she loved?with her eyes, her body, and her hands. If this were to be their last
		night, she would be able to recall every detail of it for the rest of her life.</p>

		<p>Josie could not help but see the tears glistening in
		Rebecca?s eyes. She pulled the smaller woman close to her breast and stroked her
		hair. Tears traced their way down the slope of her breast as they lay there for several
		minutes in silence. Finally Josie took a deep breath and said, her voice ragged with
		emotion, "Rebecca, there is nothing more I want than to have you with me. Always. If
		I could marry you, I would. I have dreamed of you and me together in our old age, the days
		quietly passing as we rocked on the porch and watched the sunset. That kind of life never
		appealed to me before I knew you. And now?" her voice broke and the words were
		almost inaudible when at last she continued, "I can?t bear the idea of your
		being there watching me hang. Please, stay with Charles."</p>

		<p>"I?m not going to let them hang you," Rebecca said
		with grim determination. "And I am not going to let them separate us. Where you go, I
		go. I don?t want to argue about it any more." She put her head back down on
		Josie?s breast, cupping its softness in her hand. Josie lay there in silence for
		several minutes listening to Rebecca cry softly. She knew there was no point in arguing.
		She hoped that once again the little blonde would be right. If determination alone could
		stop the hanging, Rebecca would find a way to pull it off.</p>
