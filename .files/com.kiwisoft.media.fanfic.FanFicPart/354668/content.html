<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 7 -->

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I lost track of time. I'll go get ready."
Buffy shook her head. "No, it's ok. I'm way early." Faith padded
barefoot to the couch and picked up a towel which she rubbed over her
neck and shoulders absently as she looked closely at Buffy. "Something
wrong B?" They both sat down on the couch as Faith lifted her chin and
rubbed the towel over her chest. Buffy had seemed in contemplation
before jerking her head up. "Really big fight." "Bout me?" Buffy shook
her head and Faith gave her a doubting grin. Buffy smiled rather
sadly. "No, not really. I mean that's what they SAID it was about, but
it was something more. Really it was just Xander and Riley. They were
both freaking out over us going to dinner." Faith looked down at her
feet and wriggled her toes. "Sounds like that's about me."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head and placed her hand on Faith's knee just
under the hem of her sweat shorts. "No Faith. It's not you. Xander…
Xander is Xander." While Buffy knew that was utterly vague Faith still
nodded in understanding. She pulled her hand away, but didn't notice
that Faith's eyes lingered a second when Buffy's hand had been.
"Riley… well you know how I've had to hide being a slayer from my
dates? Riley, Riley acts like he WANTS me to hide that I am the
slayer. I mean he thinks I'm reckless, but he doesn't realize that I
can lift him above my head." Both of them grinned at that as Faith
spoke. "Could it be the whole soldier thing? I mean they either give
orders or take them, and not from women?" Buffy's face scrunched up. </p>

<p>"He's not that bad. I think he just doesn't realize. I mean
his training was to protect people weaker then himself, and I don't
LOOK that much bigger." Faith smiled. "Yeah Buffy, but you ARE. Anyone
can see that the first five minutes." Buffy blushed at that as Faith
continued. "I mean after watching you slay, well even Xander knows you
can take care of yourself." Buffy rolled her eyes. "He just doesn't
like to admit it." Faith seemed unwilling to look Buffy in the eyes.
"What about the others?" Buffy smiled, but the way Faith was hanging
her head kept her from seeing it. "They trust my judgement. I mean
they are willing to tell me when I am making a mistake, but they agree
with me being here… and I'm glad I am." Faith looked up at that point,
and was unable to hide her smile.
 </p>
<p>"So what would you like to have?" Faith shrugged. "Well you
probably know the scene more then I do, but we don't have to go out."
Buffy perked up. "What? You want to order in?" Faith blushed. "That,
or I can cook." Buffy grinned. "You can cook?" Faith continued
blushing as she nodded while Buffy kept speaking. "Id like that. A
nice home cooked meal." Faith rolled her eyes as she stood up and
threw the towel over the back of the couch. "Do you want to eat right
away? Or do I have time to hit the shower?" Buffy grinned. "No, I want
to see your homemaking skills." Leading the way Faith led Buffy into
the mansions normally neglected kitchen. It seemed a little dusty, but
there were some fresh utensils and a small assortment in cupboards
left slightly open. Buffy slipped up to the counter. "I always
wondered why Angel kept a kitchen."</p>

<p>Faith shrugged. "Probably needed a place to store his blood
supply." The two paused and looked at each other for a beat, then
Faith spoke. "Let's see what's in the cupboards." They both grinned as
Buffy nodded. Faith started searching the cupboards, but Buffy noticed
that she had seemed to have slowed down with something else on her
mind. The way Faith's muscles tensed up caused the hairs on the back
of Buffy's neck to stand on end. While Faith sounded all too casual as
she spoke they seemed to be sharing the silent communication like they
did when they patrolled together. "I'm going to go see if Angel put
anything in the pantry. Buffy knew that even if Angel was willing to
keep a kitchen he would have never bothered with keep a room for food
he would never be able to eat.</p>

<p>What she did know was that the direction the dark slayer had
taken led to an outside door. She also knew that Faith excused herself
so she would not alert whoever or whatever had alerted her. That meant
that she had left Buffy to play the distraction, and while she didn't
like it she did her best. Shuffling around the kitchen, looking like
she was considering the items she found when in fact she was straining
every one of her enhanced senses to pick up what ever Faith had.
Heartbeats stretched into minutes until she heard it! The sound was
unmistakable. It was the grunt of pain that Faith allowed herself to
make when she couldn't keep a painful hit inside.</p>

<p>What she didn't hear was the dark slayer slipping silently out
a side door. She had feared that might giver her away, but Buffy's
night stalking ex had apparently made sure to keep the mansion well
maintained and the well oiled hinges didn't give her away. Faith's
senses had jumped into hyperactivity like Buffy's had, but instead of
straining they were searching, probing the inky blackness for a sign
of whatever tripped that sixth sense all slayers had. She immediately
knew it was not any type of demon because air was cool and clean with
impending night. In fact the scent seemed more human, she first
considered Xander, but she knew Xander's scent, and it was not his.
Then it clicked, it was a scent she knew, but one she smelled in
another body. Riley, Buffy's boyfriend and Faith's one night stand.
Part of her wanted to go in and just tell Buffy, but another part of
her recognized an intruder. </p>

<p>Faith was sincere in her desire to turn her life around, but
she had a promise to Angel and Wesley to take care of herself, and not
letting someone sneak around her house seemed like a good start. It
might not be actually hers, but Angel said she could use it as long as
she wanted, and that was enough. Her hands clenched into fists and
then spread into talons as she slunk down closer to the ground. While
Angel might have maintained the house the yard did not seem high on
the vampire's list of priorities and the grass felt rough under her
bare feet. Yet it also muffled what little sound her fest might have
otherwise made as she sniffed the wind and drew closer to Riley's
hiding place. Of course she guessed it would have been where he could
spy on the kitchen, but she was letting her senses prove what her mind
had deduced. </p>

<p>She was close enough to hear his breathing, and she had to
give the soldier credit. He knew how to stay concealed, how to keep
quiet. If he were facing someone other then a slayer he might have
actually remained hidden. Then again Buffy already said how he
underestimated her, and apparently Faith rated no higher in his mind.
"The doors on the other side." While Riley had been lying prone he
rolled to his feet instantly as Faith smirked at him. Trying not to
enjoy the look of shock on his face. "I said, the doors on the other
side. Has a buzzer and everything." He continued to glare at her. "I
won't let you hurt her." Faith's smirk vanished. "I have no intention
to." His eyes stayed cool focused, and while it didn't show he went up
several notches in Faith's estimation, her muscles tensed even
further. </p>

<p>"You may have fooled Buffy, but she's trusting, innocent, a
lot like Willow, and you managed to pull the wool over both their
eyes." Faith's breathing was deep and regular. "Look, I don't give a
damn what you think of me, but leave this place or I'm calling the
cops." He smiled a dark smile at that. "You're the felon. Who do you
think they'll believe?" She shook her head as her body shifted into a
defensive position. "Correction, suspected felon, and I can call the
house's owner to confirm I have the right to be here. Unless you want
to call your Uncle Sam you got nobody." He seemed ready to launch
another retort, but he instead launched an attack. The punch was
directed squarely at her head, but she was ready for it and ducked
below and outside, which put her in a perfect position to drive her
knee up into his kidney. Unfortunately her hair had grown longer
during her coma and it provided a perfect hand hold as Riley grabbed
and yanked hard enough to pull Faith off of her feet and land hard on
her back.</p>

<p>He was immediately ready to deliver a punch to her while she
was downed, but she managed to get her hands underneath her and kick
up to place both her feet into the center of the man's chest. She had
been tempted to deliver the blow to the man's throat, but she knew it
would have been instantly fatal. As it was it lifted Agent Finn into
the air and deposited him in a sitting position on the firm ground. He
quickly tried to regain his feet, but Faith did a kip up and sprang
back to a standing position. The two faced each other warily trying to
find an opening when they heard the outraged shout of Buffy Summers.
"Riley! What are you doing here?" He never took his eyes off Faith.
"Defending myself from her!" Faith looked shocked. "Liar! You attacked
me!" Riley didn't reply until Buffy blocked his line of sight by
stepping right in front of him.</p>

<p>"You still didn't answer me! What are you doing here?" He
hooked a hand around her shoulder to pull her away as he kept his eyes
on Faith. "I'm trying to protect you!" He found her immovable as she
set her feet. "From what? Faith's cooking? I'm sure it's not that
bad!" Faith looked as if she were trying to decide if she should be
offended. She then relaxed her posture. "Look, B. I'm not helping.
I'll go hit the shower and you two talk. Then just come tell me if I'm
cooking for one or two." Riley growled. "One." Buffy puffed up her
admittedly small frame. "I don't remember putting you in charge of my
dinner arrangements." The yelling seemed to fade for Faith as she made
her way back into the house, but it remained as loud as ever for the
two still outside.</p>

<p>"Riley, what is it you are not understanding? I am having
dinner with a friend. Ok, it's a friend with a past, but just a
friend! Your acting worse then you did with Angel." When he looked
away shamefully her eyes darkened. "That's it. Isn't it? Your consider
her competition. What is it because my best friend is bi? Maybe you
think Willow will infect me or something?" Riley looked offended. "No!
Of course not!" "Then what is it Riley? Do you thin Faith's going to
get me alone and sway me to the "Dyke Side of the Force?" The shamed
look returned to his face. "Hey, she is capable of anything. I mean
she stole your body." A light seemed to go on behind the slayer's
eyes. "That's what this is about isn't it? She seduced you and now you
think she's going to seduce me?" She laughed bitterly. "Go home
Riley." He looked like he wanted to say more. "Go home Riley, Go home!
Get away from me!" </p>

<p>She turned and stormed back into the house not even looking to
watch as Finn turned and walked away.  Buffy was still breathing
heavily as she walked back into the house. At least until she walked
back towards the shower. She felt the humid air, but didn't register
that she no longer heard the water. What she did register was Faith,
clean and slightly pink from the warm water. Buffy realized that Faith
was pink all over as the other slayer had nothing but a bath towel
clenched to her stomach, which did nothing to hide Buffy from seeing
Faith in all her glory. She took in the familiar things like Faith's
face and legs. Her eyes seemed to get a mind of their own as they
looked at firm round breasts with brown nipples that had stiffened in
the cooling air, and the dark patch of hairs at the juncture of
Faith's hips. </p>

<p>She stared for several seconds until Buffy spun around and
looked at the wall." Faith! Oh God I'm sorry!" The voice that answered
her seemed soft, and to Buffy it felt like it slid up and down her
spine. "It's ok Buffy." When the blonde didn't reply the voice seemed
to draw closer, as if it were responsible for making her ears burn. "I
don't mind if you see me, do you? Unless of course you liked what you
see?" Buffy's only answer was a futile attempt to swallow. She felt
Faith's strong hand gently grip her shoulder and turn her around, and
while she was looking directly into Faith's eyes the other woman's
naked body seemed to be radiating a heat directly into Buffy. "Did
you?" Buffy breathing had deepened, and as she felt Faith's breath
across her face she knew she was not the only one. </p>

<p>"All you have to do is say no. Say no and I'll stop." No words
seemed to make it to Buffy's lips before Faith found them. The feeling
of Faith's mouth against her own caused Buffy to gasp, and Faith took
it was invitation to slide her tongue inside Buffy's mouth. Yet it was
not an invasion, but a penetration, firm, but gentle first sliding up
and along the top of Buffy's mouth. Then sliding along her teeth and
pressing onto her tongue, and her tongue responded. Eagerly,
passionately, yet Faith's tongue seemed to try to control hers. It
calmed Buffy down, drew the kiss out. It had gone on several minutes
with only minimal breaks for air until Buffy's hands went weak and
dropped down, right onto Faith's naked derriere. </p>

<p>Buffy's hands immediately dropped away and the kiss broke
right after, even though Buffy's mouth moved with Faith as she pulled
back. All to steal another moment of contact. The women panted as they
gazed into each other's eyes until Buffy spoke. "I should go." Faith's
old mask of indifference slammed into place. "Yeah ok." Buffy's
expression seemed confused and afraid, but then her face steeled and
she grabbed Faith in her arms. Faith seemed completely stunned as she
found the smaller slayer wrapping herself around Faith's naked body.
"Let's train in the morning at Giles place. You can meet your watcher
all over again. Then we can come back here and you can fix me
breakfast." The last part was said rather shyly, but Buffy was smiling
and Faith did as well as she nodded.</p>
