<p>Okay here we go, not quite at the party yet, but we're getting there.</p>
<p>Disclaimer, I do not own, blah blah blah, as much as I want too, please review!</p>
<p><hr size=1 noshade>I lay on my bed staring at the ceiling. It was 6:00, the party started at 7:00, Duke would be here in about 45 minutes to pick me up. Viola was supposed to be with him, as well as Andrew. I was a bit nervous about what the car ride to the party would be like and if Duke and Viola would be able to deal with being together like that, with only me and Andrew there to break the possible awkward tension. And I knew full well that Andrew did not possess that ability. So it would be up to me to make sure it went smoothly. Really, it was the least I could do, Viola had been so kind and supportive when Sebastian and I had broken up, but I was at a lose when it came to her and Duke. Maybe that was because they just seemed so casual now. I wondered if she was hurting inside and just wasn't letting anyone see it. I didn't like the thought of Viola hurting, I silently vowed that I would do everything I could to insure Viola was okay, and over Duke. After all, what were friends for?</p>
<p>I rolled off the bed and began to get ready, finding myself looking at possible outfits and thinking, <i>Would Viola like that? I think I remember her saying that she liked that shirt. Would she think this skirt was too short?</i></p>
<p>Frustrated with my inability to make any decision with out worrying about Viola's reaction, I finally managed to find an outfit that was sexy and flirtatious, without coming across as slutty and easy to get. Dark wash jeggins and just-bellow-the-knee-high black boots, with a loser, yet still figure flattering, low cut top, which showed the perfect amount of cleavage. I hoped Viola would approve.</p>
<p>After applying only a small amount of make up, plus a smoky dark blue eye liner I had been dying to try, and fixing my hair enough to make it look presentable, I was ready to go. Ready to live the night that I hoped would change my life, without even knowing that it actually would.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang and I jumped to answer it. As I opened the door and my breath caught in my throat. Standing on the other side was Viola, looking more beautiful than I had ever seen her look before. I had always thought of Viola as perfect, but had never totally wrapped my head around how true that thought really was until now. She stood before me, dressed in a forest green halter top with gold embroidery, and a brown leather jacket. The jacket matched her brown boots that went over her dark skinny jeans, which, I couldn't help but notice, were hugging her hips perfectly. The halter top came down low, really, really low. Causing her breasts to peek out over the edge, but somehow the look wasn't slutty, and I was hardly complaining. Her eyes were rimmed in a dark green eye liner which made them almost impossible to stop staring at, while her hair curled gently around her face and flowed down over her shoulders.</p>
<p>I suddenly realized that my mouth had fallen open just a bit, and quickly shut it, looking embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Hey Liv." She said smiling at me warmly.</p>
<p>"Um, hi." I said, my voice a little unsteady. "You look amazing Vi."</p>
<p>I hoped that didn't sound too weird, or that she would take it the wrong way, even if that was exactly how I meant it.</p>
<p>"Awww! Thanks Liv!" She said flashing me a winning smile that made my heart skip a beat. "You look amazing too, absolutely gorgeous actually!"</p>
<p>I blushed at her praise. Did she really think I was gorgeous? If she did, then maybe my dreams of being with her weren't quite as unobtainable as I had first thought.</p>
<p>"You really think so?" I asked smiling shyly.</p>
<p>"Absolutely." She assured me. "Would I ever lie to you?"</p>
<p>"No, of coarse you wouldn't." I replied.</p>
<p>"Well then," she said, "let's get outta here! You ready?"</p>
<p>"Yep!" I said locking the door and turing to follow her down the hall, when I felt her hand grab mine and start to pull me with her.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay! I'm coming!" I said, and quickly came to walk beside her. I suddenly realized that she still hadn't let go of my hand, and couldn't help but stare at our intwined fingers, feeling the butterflies beginning to stir in my stomach. But as soon as we reached the outside door she dropped my hand to open it and the moment passed.</p>
<p>Duke's car was parked outside the dorms and I climbed into the back seat with Viola. Andrew was sitting with Duke in the front, and it felt much more comfortable than I had initially thought it would be. I had imagined a dead awkward silence, with me and Andrew in the back watching helplessly as Duke and Viola shot each other angry looks. But really the atmosphere was no different than how it had been at the lunch table, calm and relaxed and normal. I suddenly began to wonder what exactly had made Duke and Viola break up in the first place. When I had tried to ask Vi about it just after the break up she had just shrugged it off saying she would rather not talk about it, and me being a good friend had let it rest. But now I really did start to wonder...</p>
<p>I made a comment about Duke's car and how it was nicer than the motorcycle, and he and Viola immediately launched into a quite detailed discussion about the pros and cons of motorcycles and sports cars. I had to laugh at Viola's extensive knowledge on the subject. No other girl could argue about BMWs and Jaguars like Viola could.</p>
<p>After a few minutes however, Viola glanced over at me and saw the throughly perplexed look on my faced and laughed out loud saying, "Duke, I think we might want to switch topics. Poor Olivia is looking quite lost."</p>
<p>Duke laughed too, "I agree, Andrew's looking pretty out of it too."</p>
<p>"Huh? What?" Andrew exclaimed.</p>
<p>And we all burst out laughing.<hr size=1 noshade></p>
<p>I know, I know, short. But I felt like I needed to end it there and have the party start in the next chapter. More O/V-ness to come, and you will soon see why I decided to rate this M. Please stay with me and reviews make me happy!</p>
<p>PEACE!</p>
