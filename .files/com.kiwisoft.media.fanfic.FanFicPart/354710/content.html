<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 4 -->

<P>Thomas Eugene Paris had not risen from his knee, but B'Elanna Torres was no where to be seen. If someone where to ask those present they would say the scathing refusal still echoed in the now deafening silence. Ever dutiful the ship's morale officer bustled over to help the helmsman to his feet. As he did so he could hear him muttering as he shook his head. Once he was to his feet he spoke aloud as the rest of the crew quickly returned to the activities they postponed when they had seen the Ensign drop to one knee. "She told me Neelix, she told me but I didn't listen." Neelix got them walking towards his kitchen. "What did she say?" </P>
<P>He continued to shake his head and by his pallor the Talaxian feared that he had went into shock. "She said she was not ready, but I figured she just wasn't sure. I thought once she saw the candles, saw all our friends, saw how I set everything up for her she would have to say yes." The speckled features darkened as he listened. Both men too occupied to see the first officer rapidly depart the mess hall. "Sometimes it just isn't meant to be." The pale features shot up at that point. "Hey, this is just a set back. She just said she didn't want to marry me, right NOW. She still loves me." "I'd be careful Tom, love you or not I am willing to bet you are not our chief engineers favorite person right now."</P>
<P>He was shaking his head again, but now it was something-other then disbelief. "No, I'll go talk to her. Tell her I'm sorry." The ship's chef snagged an arm before he got out of reach. "Tom you just received a tremendous shock, and so did she. Let her cool down, and you take time to get your bearings." Tom Paris pulled free and seemed ready to leave as the doors opened to admit Harry Kim. Neelix offered a silent thanks to whomever had the foresight to call the helmsman's best friend, and apparently they informed him about the situation as he intercepted Tom with a hand on each bicep. "Woah there." "Not now Harry, I need to find B'Elanna." The men shared a worried look over Tom's shoulder as Harry then took a breath.</P>
<P>"Why did something happen?" Paris simply nodded and attempted to escape Harry's grip, but the operations officer was ready. "Let's sit down and you can tell me about it. Neelix, get us a couple beers." Paris seemed to take a long look as if he was just realizing he was talking to people and nodded. "Yeah, I could use a little something to settle my nerves." Neelix nodded and quickly moved away as Harry released Tom while motioning him to a seat. "Ok, start from the beginning." Paris nodded as he took a deep breath and ran his hands over his face. "Well you know most of it. I mean she nearly died, and her last words were that she loved me. It was after we recovered those records from the other Voyager, you know where we reviewed our doubles logs to see where things split?" Harry nodded; his mind drifting to his doubles doomed ride in the captain's chair. </P>
<P>"Well I read my doubles thoughts after B'Elanna died and I couldn't go through that Harry. I couldn't loose B'Elanna. So I thought that he had the right idea by marrying her." Harry's expression stayed inquiring. "That wouldn't have kept her from dying." Tom looked aggravated. "No of course it wouldn't! Still, it would have given that tie. It would say that we wanted a life together, even if we wouldn't get it. At least when his B'Elanna died it was as his wife." Neelix arrived with two glasses and a pitcher of beer. He set one large glass mug in front of each man and filled Tom's then Harry's. As he set the pitcher back down and stepped away Tom lifted it up and took a long drink. Pulling it away he seemed to stare into the golden liquid like some crying pool of old. "Now I've pushed my luck, and pushed her away."</P>

<P>The cavernous expanse of Cargo Bay 2 opened in front of Chakotay, but his eyes went immediately to the flickering green glow coming from one of the Borg alcoves. As he crossed the bay he saw Seven of Nine, and had to reevaluate. He had always thought of the Borg in more primitive terms, much like a vampire he thought Drone's bodies possessed by a dark spirit. Yet as he stepped up onto the platform he realized this was no undead being out to drain away his life and replace it with it's own corruption. This was no walking corpse. This was a living, breathing, hurting woman. While she was not crying in the technologically induced torpor the redness around her eyes and the faint hint of tear tracks down her cheeks told him enough. </P>
<P>He already felt like an intruder, but it did not stop him from moving to the console and shutting down the regeneration cycle, after a moment of puzzling out the controls. The instinctive step forward happened before her eyes locked on Chakotay. "I do not wish to talk, now go away." "She told him no." Seven looked at him questioningly and he repeated himself with out altering his tone or expression in the slightest. "She told him no. B'Elanna told Tom she would not marry him."  "Are you sure?" He had to laugh softly at that. "Everyone there is sure. She said it in no uncertain terms." He then took a breath, and saw Seven seem to tense as if she were bracing for a blow. "I'm not sure if you should tell her your feelings right now." </P>
<P>She looked at him painfully, and her vice seemed to be holding on to the smallest fragments of its composure. "Why?" "B'Elanna is in an emotionally fragile state after something like this. I'm not saying you have to stay away. Just be careful, this kind of situation would be tough even for someone with a lifetimes worth of emotional experience." She seemed to have regained some of her composure as she tilted her head. "Then shouldn't I stay away to prevent further damage?" "No, actually I think you may be the best thing for her right now. You honestly care for her well being, and you are as blunt as she is." Seven seemed to consider for a heartbeat. "B'Elanna told me that a sincere effort will get me farther then any emotional lesson ever could." The tribal tattoo crinkled as he arched his brows. "That's some good advice. Do you think you can put it into practice, or would you like to finish regenerating?" Her posture straightened. "She needs me, regeneration will wait." He grinned as she strode from the Cargo Bay.</P>

<P>B'Elanna laughed as her door opened; though in her current state it sounded almost like a sob. The Talaxian cook set the tray cover down next to the stack of banana pancakes he had just delivered to her quarters. "Remind me to put you in for a commendation." Neelix simply smiled. "Just doing my duty." She was utterly unashamed as she sat down and took the utensils to the stack of pancakes. An action that made his smile as he sat. "Get done talking to Tom?" He just shook his head to her question. "Harry's taking care of that. I'm here to see how you are doing." The expression on her face was distracted. "Poor Harry." "Poor Harry?" She looked at him and laughed rather bitterly. "What, you expect me to worry about Tom? He didn't worry about me."</P>
<P>Neelix shook his head. "Now that's not fair. He did propose." She set the fork down. "After I told him no. He just decided he knew better, like he always does. Do you remember the Day of Honor? How you told me about how much your traditions meant to you? Want to know what Tom said? He talked about how much time we worked on the holo-program. Not exactly the best start to a relationship. I feel wanted, but not needed. I guess I feel loved, but I don't feel very special. I feel like he wants me to have programming parameters like his cherished holo-programs." Neelix was chewing his bottom lip. "I can't argue with you there."</P>
<P>"Neelix? Can you keep a secret?" The look of pain on the engineer's face was enough to make Neelix nod silently. "One of the reasons I turned down Tom is. I realized I could have something more." She stood up and walked to her console. "Neelix, PLEASE don't tell ANYONE about this, but I need to talk to someone about it." She entered something into the console and Neelixes face was bathed in the screen's glow. "Personal Log Seven of Nine. We will not reach the demon planet."</P>
