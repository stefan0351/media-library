<p style="text-align:center;"><U>Chapter 3</U></p>
<P>Robby Ray stood proudly, arms linked with the most stunning bride Lily had ever seen, Miley looked like a princess, a queen. The piano music floated on the warm spring breeze but Lily heard none of it, it was if she was underwater. All of the world had faded, it was only Lily, staring at this angelic Miley, and the too long aisle that separated them.</p>
<P>Miley and her father began their walk down the aisle, Miley's dress was simply elegant, strapless white with sky blue sequins that formed a swirling pattern around the bust and down her back to the bottom of the dress. Her hair was pulled back from her face, raise up slightly in a ponytail so it cascaded down her back, interwoven with silver silk threads laced with tiny blue petals. The blue flowers and sequins matched Lily's light blue dress that she had finally agreed to wear in order to make Miley happy at the bridal store.</p>
<P>The pair had reached the end of the aisle and were at the edge of the steps of the platform where the priest and Jake stood, the smug smile on Jake's face had grown as Miley got closer to the platform. Miley and Robby Ray hugged and in hushed voices exchanged words. Luanne let out an exaggerated yawn, nudged Lily, and pointed to her watch, somehow that demon girl had managed to land herself as one of Miley's bridesmaids.</p>
<P><I>I'll never understand how Mr. Stewart convinced Miley to let Luanne be part of the wedding, she's probably plotted away on how to ruin this wedding…which wouldn't be so bad, while all chaos breaks loose I could run away with Miley to somewhere private where I could explain to her how I really feel, then we'd be together…and…yeah that's not going to happen. Come on Lily, control the wishful thinking, this is for Miley, you love Miley, you have to make sure she is happy, no matter what. But hot damn she looks gorgeous in that dress.</I></p>
<P>Finally the daughter and father pair finished their talk and Miley turned to take a quick gaze at the audience and waved to Uncle Earl and Aunt Pearl. Robby Ray shot Lily a look and mouthed the words, "are you sure?" Lily merely shrugged her shoulders, and looked at the groom, who had taken out his container of Thundermint and was spraying a few shots into his mouth. She looked back at Robby Ray who met her look of resignation with a grimace.</p>
<P>The priest started the ceremony but Lily just saw Miley step up on the platform, and instead of going straight to Jake's side, Miley went over to Lily and squeezed Lily's hands with hers. Lily looked down at their hands and noticed Miley's expensive and oversized diamond ring, then looked into Miley's eyes. Lily was shocked to see that Miley wasn't smiling in the slightest and instead had tears swimming in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<P>"Oh honey, darling, we're in the middle of the ceremony and I'm over here," Jake called to Miley.</p>
<P>Miley blinked her eyelids a few times and the traces of tears disappeared as did Lily's remnants of any hope for a miracle. The bride joined her groom in front of the priest.</p>
<P>Lily's heart pounded, she could feel a trickle of sweat run down her back under the beautiful bridesmaid's gown, her eyes were threatening to water, she felt her mouth go dry and her hands clenched the bouquet of roses in her grasp.</p>
<P>"Stop!" Lily screamed out, her breathes were coming out in short gasps, she couldn't hold it in any longer.</p>
<P>"Miley, you can't marry Jake. You just can't," Lily pleaded to the shocked soon-to-be wed bride.</p>
<P>"What are you talking about Lily? What's going on?" Miley asked bewildered.</p>
<P>"I think I know what's going on," Jake laughed nervously, "It's ok Lily, you can admit the truth."</p>
<P>"You know?" Lilly said surprised.</p>
<P>"Of course I do, and it's understandable, you're not over me yet, I know how badly you were crushing on me in school and now you've realized you still love me just as you were about to lose me to Miley forever," Jake said smugly.</p>
<P>"Is that the truth?" Miley asked.</p>
<P>"Well of course, I mean look at –"</p>
<P>"I asked Lily, not you Jake," Miley snapped, but softened her voice when she looked at her best friend, her maid of honor, her Lily, who looked so hurt and lost, "Lily, please, you're my best friend, you can trust me, tell me…what's going on?"</p>
<P><I>This has to be fate, a second chance to tell her the truth, how I really feel. I can do this, tell the world my secret. Then I can be with the girl of my dreams, I can make Miley happy, better than Jake ever will, I just know it. I - </I></p>
<P>"I – I – I have to go," Lily stammered. She sprinted down the aisle and away from the ceremony, leaving a shell-shocked crowd, a still egotistical Jake, and a very confused Miley.</p>
