<!-- Listen to Your Heart \ Chapter I -->

<p>"I recommend you rest now, Lieutenant."</p>
<p>The doctor is a hologram. I was fascinated until he spoke his first word. Ever since my annoyance grew. His attitude drives me mad.</p>
<p>I am confused. I don't know where I am or who I am. He told me I am a Lieutenant aboard a starfleet vessel.<br>I am - I was - chief engineer. I look at my hands as if they were not mine but somebody elses'. I see the calluses and I think that it might be true. At least I seem to be used to work with my bare hands.</p>
<p>My head feels like it's filled with mercury and I decide that it would be best to do as the doc suggested. Though his harsh tone made it sound like an order. Anyway, I fall asleep.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The next time I awake, the headaches are back. Upon my initial groan I feel a light twinge at my neck and almost instantly the worst headaches leave and my vision is clear when I open my eyes. I see the doctor retreating to his office and my gaze shifts towards the hissing sound of the automatic door.</p>
<p>I am ... shocked. This can't be true, can it?<br>There are two angels looking at me and I can see the genuine concern in their blue eyes. Not the oceanic blue like in the eyes of the captain. No, this is a steel blue. Instantly I feel caught and captured.</p>
<p>The little one is a girl of maybe four or five years and her forehead has the same deformation as mine.<br>The doc told me that this is an indication of my being half... t-... f-... /k/lingon. What ever this means. He said Klingons are another humanoid race. I assume that I must be some kind of mutant or hybrid then. This child, however, has the same ridges, although they are not as dominant as mine are. Oh, she is so beautiful, with her blue eyes and the long blond tresses. She flashes a smile at me and I can't help but return it. A questioning look at the other angelic being that holds her hand doesn't last long enough for an answer. She releases the woman's hand and runs towards my bed and instinctively I open my arms to catch her in a hug. I feel that she must love me and I sense my love for her. I even dare to hope that she might be mine. My daughter.</p>
<p>I feel another pair of blue eyes upon me and the child. As I look up I see a faint smile on the beautiful face. I notice her hair, it is also blond, but tied in a tight bun. Her skin is much paler than mine or the child's and there are some strange metal objects attached to her face. My heart aches for her because this must hurt and for the one tiny moment that I hold her gaze I feel a connection between us. My heart stops for a second before it resumes a slightly faster rhythm. But it feels as if it were the rhythm to another melody. It seems that my heart starts to remember before my mind does. This must be my partner. I feel the love for her radiating from deep inside. I know it, in this instant. This is my daughter in my arms, and this is my mate watching us. This must be my family.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, since I can only remember these last days in the sickbay of this starship, I feel at home and I bathe in the warmth of this feeling... My soul rejoices.</p>
<p>"I love you." I whisper and I feel the child hugging me even tighter.</p>
<p>Obviously the woman did not hear my whisper for she gives a cold, almost machine-like explanation of her visit.</p>
<p>"... he asked me to look after Miral while he had to ... work. The doctor finally granted Miral's wish to see you so it was me who accompanied her."</p>
<p>I am confused. He? Who is 'he'? And Miral? - Miral.</p>
<p>"Miral?" I ask.</p>
<p>"Your daughter", she tells me and points at the child in my arms.</p>
<p>"Oh. Of course." I feel ... like an idiot. I lost my memory, not my brains. I should have figured.</p>
<p>"And what... I mean, /who/ were you referring to with ... 'he' ?" I feel even more stupid when I see the look in her eyes. It tells me that I should have figured that one, too.</p>
<p>"Tom Paris. Mirals Father. He and Samantha, another young mother, looked after Miral while you were ... indisposed."</p>
<p>Her words confuse me. I let go of the child and let myself drop back onto the bed.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant, shall I ..."</p>
<p>Her facial features seem to be frozen, but somehow I manage to detect the subtle change that indicates her concern. Her calling me by my rank doesn't sound right. Not at all. It puts a distance between us that pulls at my heart.</p>
<p>"I don't remember my rank or even being an officer. Please, call me by my name - call me B- B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"As you wish, - B'Elanna."</p>
<p>Oh this sounds so right coming from her lips. Strange and not one bit familiar, but right... Then it hits me. I don't know, who /she/ is ...</p>
<p>"Uhm, what- what's your name? Who are you...? Are we..."</p>
<p>"I am Seven of Nine. I am assigned to the astrometric department of this star ship. We are colleagues."</p>
<p>Suddenly I feel dizzy. Miral still stands beside me and holds my hand. Pure bliss is showing on her face. I try to hide my lack of focus so as not to alarm her. But how can such a beautiful woman...</p>
<p>"Your name consists of numbers?" I regret to have asked that question when I see shadows floating over her face and her effort to keep her rigid stance.</p>
<p>"This is my ... designation. My human name was Annika Hansen. I prefer to be called Seven as this is what I've been called most of my life."</p>
<p>I have a lot of questions, but her look dares me to ask them. So I don't.</p>
<p>"Ok. Seven." It's unusual, but I feel like it would be stranger to call her Annika. To her and me both, I suspect.<br>She said we'd be 'colleagues' ... But I feel my love for her, how can she say we are 'colleagues' ... ?</p>
<p>"Are we... I mean...," I feel unsure of how to ask. Or what to assume, " ... are we - friends?"<br>I feel like I'm being impaled by her questioning gaze. But then it softens, as if she remembers my current dilemma. She gathers herself and when she answers she reminds me of a teacher. Which is strange, because I don't remember any teachers.</p>
<p>"Hardly." She says in a quite cold and impersonal tone. "We are colleagues aboard this vessel. In our private lives we are merely acquaintances. Our personalities are incompatible. Our encounters are dominated by arguments and misunderstandings. Therefore they are to be avoided."</p>
<p>This time I don't see any emotions in her face or her body language at all. She stated facts. And she seems to be completely unaffected. A hot feeling rises from my belly - I think this is my short temper the doctor and the captain told and warned me about. I feel anger rising. I'm angry at her, her being unaffected, while I ...</p>
<p>"But I love you! I-I can feel it..." It's out before I realize it.</p>
<p>Two sets of blue eyes drenched in confusion look at me as if I'd lost my mind. Well, I had, had I not?</p>
