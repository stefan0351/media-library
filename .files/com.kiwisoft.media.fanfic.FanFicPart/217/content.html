<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>"Don't give me that look Angel!" The dark slayer paced around
Angel's office as the soul-filled eyes of the vampire followed her
from where he was sitting. "Faith, I thought you were going to finally
take responsibility for your actions. To turn your life around." "I
want to! I am."  She paused and took a deep breath. "I just can't do
that from prison. I mean look at you Angel. You've killed how many
people? A hundred, a thousand, but your out here doing good, making a
difference… I need that." He stood up but remained silent and Faith
took that as the unspoken request it was. "I'm a slayer Angel, "One
from every generation chosen to battle the forces of darkness…"hell
I'm not even "one" but I AM a slayer. I CAN stand against the
darkness."</p>

<p>Angel put a hand on her shoulder, and to his surprise she
didn't shrug it off. "For how long? Faith, I exiled myself from human
contact for over a decade after I was first cursed. It wasn't until
Whistler brought me back that I started fighting evil again." Faith
simply gave the vampire a grin and he fought one from appearing on his
face. "Like I did for you…" She nodded slowly. "Angel, I was hiding
too. Hiding behind the tough girl image, and when I couldn't hide from
someone I pushed them away. Well there is no way to hide in a slate
gray cell." Angel closed his eyes and opened them. "That's when you
decided to recant your confession?" Faith nodded. "Between Wilkins and
the general cluelessness of the cops when dealing with the
supernatural there was not enough evidence to convict me."</p>

<p>"So you get away with murder?" Faith turned angrily. "How many
have you gotten away with? Maybe I should go waste a couple hundred
more people first huh? Or maybe just kill a gypsy?" Angel grit his
teeth. "I'm being punished in ways you can not even imagine." She
stepped right up to him. "Yeah, but you also have something I don't!
You have a shot at redemption! I'm not going to find it staring at the
world through a set of bars!" The vampire's undying stare didn't blink
as he looked at her. "Faith, I've been alive over two centuries and I
still have to fight not to give in to the darkness." She didn't step
back, but she allowed her posture to soften. "You're also immortal two
hundred years, or two thousand unless you end up on the wrong end of a
stake you'll be around. Slayers are anything but immortal Angel. The
only reason I'm here is because Buffy died!"</p>

<p>A naked looked of pain crossed the vampires features, but it
vanished immediately. "Angel, my slayer powers were able to keep me
safe in jail, but how long would that last? One inmate getting a lucky
shot and the next slayer is gets called. The same thing could happen
with a lucky demon, but at least I will be out there, doing what I was
made to do, and helping people as I do it." While it was unnecessary
Angel took a deep breath as he looked into Faith's eyes, and there he
saw a person very few people have seen. He saw who Faith could have
been if she had been raised better, he saw the woman Faith could have
been if someone had given her a chance. For Angel it was almost like
seeing Buffy, a dark reflection of Sunnydale's slayer, but a
reflection none the less.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" Faith's head dropped and she ran a hand
through her hair. "Well Buffy went to all the trouble to travel here.
I suppose I should return the favor." Angel's concern was blatant but
Faith seemed to realize that it was for her. "Is that wise." Faith
shrugged. "Kind of hard to repent for hurting people if you're not
willing to face them. I don't want to open any wounds for them, but I
want to let them know it's over. Give them that closure." The gaze of
the vampire never flickered and Faith let out a laugh that seemed just
short of a sob. "Thinking of others, has to be a good step huh?"
Angel's expression softened. "Yes, it is." "Thanks for picking me up
at the jail. I'll get out of your hair." Angel touched her elbow. "In
the morning."</p>

<p>She stared at his hand on her elbow, and then back up at his
face and nodded once. He took his hand away and led her further back
into the office. When they reached a couch Angel stopped. Wordlessly
she lay down on the couch, but before she was able to get comfortable
she felt Angel drape a blanket over her. "Sweet dreams." Faith got
comfortable. "For once I think that may actually happen." As he
silently closed the door behind him he returned to the front area of
the office. As he did he ran into Wesley, the former Watcher's eyes
looking back where he came. "How is she?" Wesley was already speaking
in hushed tones, and Angel did as well. "Sleeping, she's going back to
Sunnydale in the morning." Angel saw the concern on Wesley's face. </p>

<p>"She's going there to make amends." The concern never
faltered. "Still, do you think that safe? I doubt the other slayer's
feelings have changed. No matter how Faith's have." Angel shook his
head. "She's always been able to take care of herself physically, it's
her soul that needs taking care of, and that's why she needs to go.
I'm just going to get her some expense money. Have you seen the check
book?" "I believe Cordelia took it with her on vacation." Angel looked
at the Watcher aghast as the man grinned. They both chuckled as they
looked around the office. The former watcher sighed. "Do you believe
she will be successful?" Angel blinked. "I think she already has." At
the look of confusion Angel continued. "The fact she trying is what
counts."</p>

<p>Wesley nodded as Angel kept speaking. "Though it will be
easier if she can find the forgiveness she seeks." Both men seemed to
grow frustrated at their inability to find the checkbook as the door
leading father back into the office opened. They booth looked up as a
sleepy eyed Faith stepped through. "Hey Wes… how's the arm?" Wesley
smiled at her. "Fine, I don't even notice it any more." She returned a
faint smile. "So what are you guys looking for?" Both men looked
shamed as Angel spoke. "We can't find the checkbook." She looked at
both of the men for several seconds as she then walked over to the
chair Angel had dropped his jacket over. Even the vampire seemed to
blush as she handed it over. "What do you need it for anyway?"</p>

<p>Angel paused as if reluctant to speak. "I'm going to give you
some traveling expenses." She seemed ready to speak but he cut her
off. "Faith, you think I like taking money to help people? You can't
eat good intentions. Now if this money can help someone else it's
worth it. Let me help you." Angel's words up until that point didn't
seem to effect her, but when he asked her to let him help her she
dropped her shoulders and nodded. While he had allowed himself to be
shunted to the side Wesley spoke up again. "If you don't mind me
saying you look as if you could use several more hours of sleep, and
it is still awhile before morning." Faith nodded. "Thanks Wes… Angel."
Wesley stepped close to her. "When I was your watcher there were
numerous rules about keeping an emotional detachment, but I am no
longer a watcher, so I can say this. I believe in you Faith."</p>

<p>She started blinking rapidly, and they all knew it was to keep
the tears from spilling out. "Thanks… I'm going to head back to the
couch." Both men nodded and wished her goodnight as she disappeared
back into the office. Angel wrote out the check and tore it free. He
then tucked the checkbook into a desk drawer and picked up his coat.
"Will you be going with her?" Angel shook his head. "This is the kind
of thing she has to do herself. Though I am going to see if she will
stay at the mansion and I'll make sure she can call us if she needs
anything." Wesley again looked worried. "Do you think they will try to
hurt her." Angel shrugged. "It's possible, but I just want to make
sure she has someone to talk to." As Angel walked out the door he was
left alone and with out even thinking about it he turned back into the
office.</p>

<p>As quiet as he was able he opened the door into the room he
knew held the sleeping slayer. Though when he opened the door he saw
anything but the scourge of darkness. He saw a young girl, hurting,
frightened, but no longer alone, because while he could see the tear
tracks on her cheeks he also saw that she was sleeping soundly. He
thought it was almost a half-hour he stood there simply watching, but
the tough almost made him want to laugh. Watching, while he knew the
full extent of Faith's fate was not his fault he knew he bore part of
the blame because he was so content to merely watch. To follow the
rules and regulations of some antiquated council while he sent a young
girl out to kill or die. He closed his eyes tightly, thinking that he
too may cry, but instead he whispered. "I'm sorry too." Just as
silently he slipped from the office and did not hear another whisper
that was soft, but laden with fresh tears. "It's ok."</p>
