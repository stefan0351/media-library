<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 9 -->

<p>Faith stood across from the two men as Spike looked up and
down her body. "I guess I heard right, you really do like slaying in
the buff. Or are you here for the full gallop?" Faith's left hand was
spread wide as her right gripped a wooden stake. "Sorry Spike, but the
complexion problem is a big turn off." "Oh I'm hurt." He attempted to
hurt her as he lashed out with two rapid right hand punches. Faith
blocked both with her right arm and slashed the stake across Spike's
chest, but the vampire managed to pull back just enough so that she
missed him. Riley had the gun out and seemed to be trying to decide
which to shoot. Something both of his potential targets noticed. Spike
responded by jumping back from the line of fire. While Faith twisted
and hurled her stake into his shoulder as a shot went off and to the
side Faith jumped back and landed with the small of her back on the
windowsill. She grabbed it with both of her hands and flipped back
inside.</p>

<p>Riley was still standing, but he had dropped his gun. His one
hand hung uselessly while the other was trying to pull the wooden
stake free. He was still trying when Spike walked up to him, still
grinning in game face. "Don't worry. I'll still keep my part of the
bargain. I'll kill Faith, but I won't promise that you'll be alive to
see it." With that he yanked the stake from Riley's shoulder. Riley
gave a bitten down shout as she dropped to his knees. Spike smiled as
he considered the stake. He then licked Riley's blood from it and then
dropped it in front of him. He was laughing as he strode off into the
night. The next thing that penetrated was the sound of Faith's voice.
"He's over here!"</p>

<p>He tried to get up and run away, but two men were grabbing
him. He brought his one good elbow up and into one person's
midsection, but as he did the person on his injured side threw their
weight on him and the added pain on his shoulder sent him back to his
knees. He then felt a forearm clench across his windpipe. "Can't you
drug him or something?" He recognized Faith's voice posing the
question and it sent a fresh dose of adrenaline through his system. It
was actually enough to get him starting to pry Faith's arm from around
his neck, but as he did so he felt a hypodermic needle stick in one of
the veins on his neck, and then he didn't feel anything else.
Including dropping to the ground in a boneless heap.</p>

<p>What he felt next was waking up in a hospital bed with one
large bandage on one arm, and a handcuff on the other. His waking was
too late to hear Buffy's arrival to the hospital. "Faith? What
happened?" The dark slayer looked up from her seat in the waiting
room. When she saw they were alone she looked at the ground and spoke.
"I staked him." Behind Buffy's shoulders Xander spoke up. "See?" He
was universally ignored as Buffy sat down next to her. "Why?" She kept
looking down. "I didn't want to give him the chance to decide between
shooting me or Spike." Buffy blinked. "Spike? What was Spike doing
there?" Faith shifted uncomfortably in her seat. "He was talking with
Riley."</p>

<p>They all could see that Faith had more to say so Buffy asked
the question. "What would they be talking about?" Faith swallowed. "I
woke up and heard some yelling. So I grabbed my stake and moved to
investigate." Xander piped in. "Were you naked again?" Faith shrugged.
"I was thinking "grab weapon" not "grab pants". Anyway I went out to
investigate, and I saw Riley pushing some button, and then Spike was
in game face." Faith took another deep breath and deliberately didn't
look at Buffy. Then I heard Spike tell Riley "Don't worry Riley. I'll
kill Faith for you. Then I'll turn her. Split you and blondie between
us." They all fell silent, even Xander seemed torn between if he
wanted to call Faith a liar, or use what she said as proof of how bad
Riley was. Buffy nodded. "Are you sure that's what he said? That he
would kill you FOR Riley?" </p>

<p>Faith looked plaintively at Buffy. "Look B…" Buffy shook her
head and gave Faith a tired smile. "I believe you. I want to think
that you only heard part of the conversation, but I know you're not
lying to me." Faith smiled in relief and as the only one looking in
Buffy's eyes at the moment she was able to see a seconds softening.
Just as quickly it was gone. The expression on her face was what she
had when she met the Master after rising from the dead to destroy him.
"I have to talk to Riley." They all nodded or looked away as a
familiar, determined stride headed towards the room that held Riley
Finn. After they heard the door close Faith stood up. "Can I talk to
you Xander?" Xander looked to Giles, Willow, Anya, and even Tara, but
none of them seemed willing to help, Anya had forgiven him for his
past indiscretion with Faith, but seemed unwilling to help him avoid
another one.</p>

<p>She led him to a stairwell. "Ok Xander. I want to make things
right with everyone, including you. Now how can I do that?" "Xander
stared at her as coldly as he could. "What about Riley? How are you
going to make amends with him?" Faith shrugged. "I hid the gun he
pulled on me. I think that about sets things right. Now Xander… what
will it take to get you to trust me? Or if I can't get you to trust
me, what can I do to get you to tolerate me?" He started nodding.
"Stop making moves on Buffy." Her jaw dropped, then she took a breath.
"Xander, I'm not making moves on Buffy. I, I just… look I can't change
how I feel for her? I don't know if I would even if I could. I mean
Buffy's like coming into a warm house after the snow. Like wrapping
yourself up in a blanket that's all fresh and warm from the dryer.
It's not a matter of making moves on Buffy, it's a matter of not being
able to deny how she makes me feel."</p>

<p>Faith had focused on what she had been saying, and had not
seen how Xander had nodded at her description of her feelings. "Well,
corny poetics aside, I do understand that. I'll also forget the whole
criminal past thing. I was once possessed by a hyena spirit that
stripped away my morals." While Faith gave a slight scowl at Xander's
"corny poetics" comment she then looked curious. "What did you do?"
"I… I ate a pig." "A pig? Was he dead and called bacon?" Xander shook
his head. "No he was alive and called Herbert. Among other things." He
looked ashamed. "I tried to rape Buffy." Faith's expression seemed
amazed, but he saw no condemnation there. "I faked amnesia, but either
way Buffy managed to forgive me… I guess I should be willing to do the
same for you."</p>

<p>She looked curious. "Even?" He shook his head. "Friends…
loosely casual acquaintance friends, but friends." She smirked.
"Anya?" Xander nodded. "She may no longer have her powers, but a
millennia's worth of vengeance is not something you want to play
with." Faith nodded, and the both smiled slightly as they walked back
out to join the others. As the two got back they all looked at Anya,
the former demon just looked up and spoke. "Xander knows better."
While Xander looked slightly put out the rest grinned as they sat back
down. Unaware of what was happening behind Riley's door.</p>

<p>When she first stepped through the door he couldn't help but
smile, then he saw her expression and his smile vanished. He was not
dealing his girlfriend, or with the woman Buffy Summers, this was the
Slayer, and for the first time Riley was able to understand exactly
what that meant. While he wouldn't admit it to anyone, let alone
himself, when he looked into her eyes he felt fear. "If you want to
deny what I am about to say you can, but I will go to Spike for
clarification since it concerns him too." The fearful look that
crossed his face at that mention answered her question for her, and
while it may have caused her some sadness inside, no trace of it
showed. "Why?" He seemed to be trying to think of something to say but
she cut him off. "You haven't denied anything. So now it's just a
matter of why. Spike's probably out there killing someone, and not
only is that your fault but both slayer's are busy with you so they
are not out there trying to stop him. In one minute I am going out
that door to do my duty and put down that monster you unleashed. Is
there anything you have to say?"</p>

<p>Riley wouldn't meet her eyes. "I guess Faith was successful,
she broke us up." Instead of replying Buffy moved to stand right in
front of his bed. "I never told you the details of my dream sent to me
by the first slayer. Needless to say you were in it. You and a fully
human Adam were in some Initiative designed living room plotting world
domination. When I asked you why you told me it was what governments
do. The Riley Finn I fell in love in would never do that and he would
never unleash an animal like Spike. The Riley Finn from my dream, now
he would have no trouble doing it, and wouldn't care who happened to
die in the process as long as he got what he wanted." Riley looked up;
any pain he was feeling was ignored. "Buffy, I swear I was going to
kill him." She stepped up and rested her hands at the feet of his bed.
"What? After he killed Faith? You know it was wrong and that's why you
can't look at me."</p>

<p>The thing that seemed to be unnerving Riley Finn the most was
not the look on the slayer's face, or the way she didn't walk as much
as stalk, each movement laden with repressed power. What really shook
him was the fact Buffy's voice hadn't changed, and she hadn't yelled.
The fact was Riley had literally seen her read a menu with more
emotion. "When I was in LA I told Angel I knew you. I was wrong." With
that the slayer walked out of his room, and Riley knew it was for
good. The cuff had been removed because he learned that Faith had
refused to press charges, and even explained away his hitting of one
of the paramedics as a panic reaction after being stabbed. He tested
the shoulder and found the wound was not too deep, and so he started
to get dressed.</p>

<p>Out in the other room Buffy emerged still in slayer mentality,
and her eyes immediately locked with Faith's. "Spike's still out
there." Faith nodded and stood up, Buffy then nodded. "Are you ready?"
Faith looked down. "It's been awhile, but it's not the kind of thing
I'd forget." Then to the surprise of the rest of the room Buffy
smirked. "We'll start slow." Faith looked a bit shocked but smiled as
she accepted a stake as followed Buffy out of the hospital. Willow was
the first to speak. "Did Buffy seem a little…" Xander finished her
sentence. "You Jane, Me Jane as well?" Willow nodded, and then they
all did.</p>
