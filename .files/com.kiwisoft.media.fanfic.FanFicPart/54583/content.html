<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 5: Dinner -->

<p>In her anger at the blackened lump that was supposed to be her
		dinner, Josie kicked the spit, sending the burnt food and wood flying. Grabbing her knife
		from her boot, she set off to catch another rabbit. Darkness had already settled, making
		it more difficult for her to find more meat.</p>

		<p>Two hours later, a large jackrabbit was skewered on a new spit
		and set to cook. Josie settled down against a large rock and started to disassemble and
		clean one of her guns. For safety's sake, she always had one fully loaded at all times.
		The firelight bounced off the gleaming metal as she slowly and methodically polished the
		weapon. After both guns were perfectly cleaned and polished, she reached for her
		Winchester.</p>

		<p>Josie had just opened the breech of the rifle when she heard the
		clear sounds of someone moving closer to her. Whoever it was was making too much noise to
		be of any danger, but the outlaw put her hand on her Peacemaker just in case. A branch
		must have hit the girl because Josie heard the quickly becoming familiar voice yelp. She
		released her grip on the handle of her gun. "You'd better come out here before I
		start shooting." She yelled.</p>

		<p>Rebecca stumbled through the brush and into the small clearing.
		The flames illuminated the frown on the outlaw's face. "I told you not to follow
		me." Josie scowled, turning her attention back to the cooking food.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry. It's just that I'm cold and hungry and I smelled
		your food, and well I guess I just followed my nose." Rebecca started to ramble on,
		then thought better of it when the outlaw glared at her. Josie said nothing, turning her
		attention back to the food. Unsure of what to do, Rebecca backed up a few steps and sat
		down, her face barely visible in the campfire. She sat quietly and watched as the outlaw
		slowly cleaned her rifle, seemingly oblivious to the burning food. "You're going to
		ruin it." She said clearly, although inside she was nervous. Josie glared at her.
		"I mean the rabbit. It's burning."</p>

		<p>Cursing loudly, Josie reached over and turned the spit. One side
		of the skinned animal was burned slightly, but most of the meat was still good. Without
		saying a word, she sat back and returned to the task of cleaning her weapon. This time,
		however, she kept one eye on her dinner.</p>

		<p>Rebecca watched as Josie cut the meat off of the carcass and laid
		it on a flat piece of bark. The outlaw deftly sliced the hunks of meat into smaller
		pieces. Stabbing the pieces with her knife, Josie ate half the meat while the hungry woman
		watched. The outlaw looked over at her. "Here." She held out the piece of bark
		holding the meat. "Come on, I know you're hungry. Your stomach makes almost as much
		noise as your mouth." Josie didn't bother to admit that it was only the girl's
		interruption that kept the rabbit from being burnt to a crisp.</p>

		<p>Rebecca timidly walked over to take the makeshift plate from the
		outlaw. Once the plate was in her hand, however, the smell of the cooked meat overwhelmed
		her fear. She sat right down, only a few feet from Josie, and proceeded to greedily eat
		the rabbit. "Mmm, oh this is so good, mmm, I haven't eaten since... oh thank you, by
		the way. I didn't know if you were going to, mm, give me any, even though you should have,
		since... I saved your dinner." Josie's eyebrow arched prominently as the rest of her
		face remained stoic and unreadable. Rebecca decided that perhaps she had said too much.
		She ate another bite in silence as her eyes settled on the canteen.</p>

		<p>"Here." Josie said in an exasperated tone as she handed
		her the water. "Try not to drink it all." Rebecca heard the words and took only
		a few small swallows before handing it back. Her thirst was barely touched but she dared
		not take any more. Josie knew by the weight of the flask that the girl had taken very
		little. The green eyes still stared at the container. Cursing herself inwardly, Josie
		passed the canteen back. Rebecca smiled and drained the flask.</p>

		<p>Rebecca set the now empty piece of bark down and stared at the
		ground. "Did you want something else?" Josie growled, keeping her focus on the
		rifle.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, it's just that it's warmer by the fire." She
		looked around. "And there are no snakes."</p>

		<p>"Make your own damned fire." The outlaw muttered in a
		voice clear enough for the young woman to hear. Rebecca nodded and slowly rose to her
		feet. She faced away from the outlaw, her head hung low.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for the food and water." She said as she
		slowly walked away, hoping that the outlaw would offer to let her stay. No such words
		came.</p>

		<p>Rebecca walked until she could just make out the campsite through
		the brush. She sat down on the ground and leaned her back against a tree; her focus fixed
		on the woman near the fire. She fell asleep to the sight of Josie stoking the fire with
		logs, banking it for the night.</p>

		<p>Josie silently crept over to where she knew the girl was
		sleeping. The pale moonlight pierced through the leaves and shone upon the sleeping face.
		She now saw bruises that weren't there the day before. 'No wonder you're running away.'
		Josie thought to herself. 'But I'm not going to be your caretaker.'</p>
