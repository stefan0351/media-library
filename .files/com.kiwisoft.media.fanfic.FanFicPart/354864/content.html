<!-- The Scientific Method \ Chapter 7 - Verify -->

<p>Janeway stared at the padd in her hands silently; when she looked up she met the eyes of her second in command sitting across from her at her desk, and was unable to hold back a deep sigh. "It's official?" Chakotay kept his voice a comforting near whisper as he replied. "It's official." The silence stretched into an eternity before Commander Chakotay continued in a still soothing, but normal sounding voice. "Kathryn, I know that you?" The captain raised a hand. "I knew you did the second you walked in, you looked like you were informing me of a crewmembers death."</p>

		<p>The commander looked away, then back before Janeway continued, while shaking her head. "I don't know what I expected. That she would just stand around it her alcove and be beautiful until we got back to the Alpha Quadrant? Maybe until I finished my career in Starfleet." Chakotay looked solemnly at the captain. "Part of being in command is making those tough decisions."</p>

		<p>Captain Janeway didn't bother to conceal the pain in her eyes as she looked into the gaze of her second in command. "I've been saying that ever since we got her back from The Raven." Captain Kathryn Janeway scrunched her eyes tightly together and shook her head. "Seven of Nine is a part of this crew, and to not give her the simple accommodation of quarters is ridiculous, ok any requests from ships stores." Chakotay let a look convey his concern for his captain as he nodded and left the ready room."</p>

		<p>Ok, now HOW did we get roped into helping with the move?" B'Elanna Torres threw a rather dark grin at the sandy hair helmsman. "Well, as I figure it you were SO nice to help Seven with her wooing of me. I figured you would just naturally want to see the conclusion." Paris was giving Torres an exaggerated leer as he replied. "Well now, what would seeing the conclusion have to do with moving?"  Paris found his leer cut off but a grimace of pain as Torres punched him in the arm. "You must have forgotten how hard I can hit, Tom."</p>

		<p>The once hollow confines of Cargo Bay Two seemed to ring with laughter and shine with smiles as Seven and Harry Kim smiled from where they were working at the Borg alcoves. Tom Paris found the grins of the rest of his friends contagious as Harry started to speak. "I should have known B'Elanna, you haven't "missed" him yet." B'Elanna laughed outright as Paris shot Harry a mock scowl. "Well we now know Tom is here to take abuse and carry heavy things, but what am I here for?"</p>

		<p>Seven's clear tone answered the question. "The abuse Mr. Paris receives could be considered self-inflicted. You on the other hand are here because you are one of the best versed of Voyager's crew in Borg technology, and we are designing a regeneration unit that will fit in B'Elanna's quarters." B'Elanna was quick to correct Seven. "OUR quarters love, remember that." Seven smiled shyly before continuing in a more subdued voice. "You and Tom are also our friends, and we desired your inclusion."</p>

		<p>There was a companionable silence that was eventually broken by Tom Paris. "Ok, if there is any more sweetness I am going to have to get a hypo of insulin." B'Elanna looked confused. "You're not a diabetic." He was grinning, and cringing as he replied. "I will be after much more of this." B'Elanna threw a mock punch that turned into a pat on the shoulder. Harry looked up from where he and Seven were working. "Ok, so what you guy want is ... a Borg Bed?" Seven nodded. "Essentially so. B'Elanna feels that having to be in such a vulnerable position in a cargo bay is unacceptable."</p>

		<p>Torres seemed to dismiss the notion with a wave of her hand. "I just think you're so cute when you regenerate, and I don't want to share." As Seven blushed slightly Paris was ginning. "So, will the cube cot be a single, or a double?" Seven tilted her head, but did not notice the slightly silly grin it gave Lt. Torres. "The unit is just for my regeneration purposes, B'Elanna's bed will be used for her rest and for our copulation." B'Elanna blushed and looked away as the two men grinned, and Harry spoke. "Seven, we are going to have to teach you a thing or two about discretion."</p>

		<p>Seven looked at the young man calmly. "Discretion is irrelevant. It means I would not get to watch B'Elanna blush." Tom and Harry laughed outright while Seven kept a straight face, B'Elanna looking slightly miffed, but only able to blink. Seven then continued as the four settled down a bit. "However I am not sure how successful we will be in creating the miniaturized alcove. The Collective already makes the units as compact as possible to maximize space in a vessel." Harry leaned over to look at the information Seven had called up, frowned, and rested a hand on her shoulder.  "Don't worry Seven, we'll think of something." B'Elanna immediately interrupted. "Until we do I'll just have to come down here and stay with you while you regenerate." Seven immediately straightened her posture. "That would be inefficient, you also require your rest." B'Elanna threw the statuesque blonde a playful look. "I'll let you watch me sleep." Seven bit back her smile as she tried to reply, but was cut off by B'Elanna who kept her grin while saying. "Comply." Seven looked about to argue as Tom stepped in. "Woah, woah, why don't we just put up some walls? Maybe put in a second door, just wall this area off, Seven gets her privacy, and will still be able to regenerate."</p>

		<p>Everyone considered the idea for several seconds when they started to smile, Harry being the first to comment. "We forgot to mention he was also here for his practical, homespun wisdom." "B'Elanna arched her ridged brow. "Yeah, he's a regular Martha Stewart." Paris looked rather offended as Harry and Seven exchanged a confused glance. B'Elanna clapped her hands together as she looked over her two friends and her cybernetic angel. "Well, Chakotay said that we pretty much have Carte Blanche on this thing. So I will get an engineering crew set to section off this part of the cargo bay, and Seven can show you two how to rearrange our quarters." The two men shared a groan, as the two women shared a smile."</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine had never had much occasion to be undressed for long periods of time. As a drone she was constantly encased in her protective armor, and once she had been rescued from the Collective environmental concerns, cultural issues, and Seven's own belief that her body was little more then a vessel had her only undress to change into another biosuit. While she did not recall if the young Annika Hansen had any opinion the grown Seven of Nine found the sensations of being nude under the bed's blankets to be quite enjoyable.</p>

		<p>What was under the blankets with her was causing even more pleasurable sensations. In sleep B'Elanna Torres wrapped herself around Seven's much larger form in an almost possessive fashion. Arms wrapped around Seven's rib cage the hands rested on the shoulder opposite where her head rested. B'Elanna had her legs tangled with Seven's, but as a higher angle as her hip was roughly at the termination at the bottom of Seven's abdominal implant, or as B'Elanna seemed to enjoy calling it. Her "Borg Bellybutton".</p>

		<p>Though not all of the sensory input was tactile, there was also the freshly showered, wonderfully organic smell of B'Elannas skin. What amazed Seven even more were the sounds that the woman was making in her sleep. They seemed to be directly related to outside stimulus as B'Elanna would seem to make a contented purring sound if Seven would supplement the arm already cradling her with the other hand caressing her face or hair. She would also make an almost growling sound when Seven would shift to allow her arms healthy circulation, but at the moment the only sound was the steady rhythm of both of their breathing.</p>
