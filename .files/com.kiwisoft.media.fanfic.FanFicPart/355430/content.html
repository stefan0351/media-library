<!-- Secret Desires \ Part 4 -->

<p>As the school day began Sam rushed to her homeroom class and
			found a seat. The next thing she knew she had a very out of breath
			and very nervous Lily standing by her side, holding a copy of the
			school paper and pointing wildly at it.</p>
		<p>"What is it? What's wron." she started to ask, taking the
			paper from Lily.  Suddenly Sam felt faint. Her eyes got wide and her
			jaw dropped.  She turned back to face Lily. </p>
		<p>"How?" then she turned and looked around her.  She noticed that
			almost everyone in the class had a copy of the paper, even the
			teacher, and the ones that didn't were reading with the ones that
			did.  Then she looked toward the back of the room where Brooke and
			Nicole were sitting and reading the poem.</p>
		<p>"Great!" She looked back to Lily. "I am going to move out of the
			country, would you like to come along?" Putting her head down on the
			desk she let out a deep sigh.  Lily sat down in the chair next to Sam.</p>
		<p>"Hey, no one knows you wrote it.  And it's a big hit with the
			one it was meant for.  I heard her talking to the blonde bimbos."
			When Sam lifted her head slightly to look at her again, Lily went
			on. "She it was the most beautiful, sweet and romantic poem she had
			ever read and that it actually made her knees weak." </p>
		<p>Sam sat up all the way and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Heh, I made her knees weak?" At Lily's nod, she turned to look
			at the blonde again and Brooke looked up at the same time.  They
			stared for a few minutes until Nicole nudged Brooke to get her
			attention. But right before Brooke looked away, she smiled at Sam.</p>
		<p>Sam looked at Lily's knowing smirk and she shrugged. Before
			either of them could say anything more, the principal's voice sounded
			through the intercom.</p>
		<p>"Good morning students. I would like to take this moment
			to thank all the students that have helped with the preparations for
			the Valentine's Day  Masquerade Dance.  And I would also like to say
			thank you to all the students who have participated in the poem
			contest. I have seen a lot of talent and work go into them.  And on
			that topic, we have a student that would like to say a few words
			about one that was posted in today's.  So I will turn over the
			microphone to her.  Mary Cherry you are up."</p>
		<p>4 sets of eyes widened, then turned to the seat that should
			have been occupied by the southerner. </p>
		<p>"OK, Ah would first like ta say ta who ever 'Brooke Addict'
			is: y'all have gotten ouah lil' Brookie's attention. Ah mean she is
			ve-ry excited. Y'all have even gotten her panties awl wet."</p>
		<p>She was cut off as everyone heard a struggle and the
			principal's voice in the background sounding shocked.</p>
		<p>"You can't say things like that! Give me the microphone!"</p>
		<p>Sam looked back quickly to see Brooke's face flush red as she
			tried to hide her face with her hands. And Nicole was just sitting
			there growling lowly, looking up at the speaker as if she was trying
			to will Mary Cherry to be sucked through it so that she could slap
			her.</p>
		<p>Finally Mary Cherry's voice popped back on after the scuffle.</p>
		<p>"Ah am so sorry.  Ah am apparently not allowed ta say things like
			that.  Even though it's true. Anyways, if what y'all say in yer poem
			is true, come see Nicole and Ah.  Cause if ya pass inspection, y'all
			can be our lil' Brookie's date for the Valentine's Day Dance. Ah
			mean, if y'all are a nerd, geek or mentally challenged don't even
			bother ta apply."</p>
		<p>"OK," The principal's voice once again interrupted Mary
			Cherry's announcement. "Well, I believe that is it for today.
			Remember to buy your tickets for the dance at the newspaper office
			and have a good day."  </p>
		<p>Lily and Sam looked at each other and smiled. Sam being the
			normal smart ass that she is, had to ask.</p>
		<p>"Hey, do you think I would pass inspection?" and both girls
			laughed.</p>
		<p>Everyone was quiet for a while as they all read the paper.
			Sam was lost in her own thoughts and Brooke was  trying to recover
			from her humiliation.   </p>
		<p>When Lily let out a loud 'wow', Sam looked at her
			questioningly. "</p>
		<p>It seems that you have a secret admirer, too," she said as
			she handed Sam the paper. "And apparently they are quite talented
			too."</p>
		<p>Sam read the poem and she started to blush. A huge smile
			spread across her face when she was done.</p>
		<p>"That was sexy!" </p>
		<p>When the bell rang to signal the end of class, everyone stood
			up and filed out into the halls. Sam felt weary.  But she figured
			that was to be expected since her most private thoughts about the
			girl she loved, who just happened to be her soon to be step sister
			and her house mate, were just made very public.</p>
		<p>Lily looked at Brooke and then back at Sam as an idea formed
			in her head. </p>
		<p>"Sam? Why don't you use this to your advantage? Sort of a venting
			system?" When she got a 'What the hell are you talking about' look
			from Sam she went on.</p>
		<p>"Well, now you know that your poem excited her.  You can post
			another or just send her more." Lily watched as Nicole dragged Mary
			Cherry to the Novak by her ear and just shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Why would I do that Lily? I mean, she doesn't know it's me and
			don't you think she might get mad if she does find out?" Sam said as
			she was getting stuff out of her locker.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Sam felt someone come up close behind her and knew by
			the perfume wafting around her who it was. Still facing the locker,
			she closed her eyes and inhaled.  Lily saw this and thought (Yep,
			She's got it bad) </p>
		<p>"Hey," Brooke said to them both but looking at Sam.
			Sam turned to face the only person who could make her feel things she
			didn't know were possible with just a look.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Brooke," she forced a smile as she looked into
			deep hazel eyes.  Sam looked to the paper still in Brooke's hands and
			smiled.  "Interesting reading, huh?"  Brooke laughed.               </p>
		<p>"Apparently.  I saw that you have a secret admirer too.
			Any idea who it might be?" Brooke sounded casual but she really
			wanted to know.  But she couldn't understand why.  Sam looked at her
			surprised.</p>
		<p>"Nope not a clue," she said with a smile. Then, before
			she could say anything else, Nicole walked up with a very chastised
			looking Mary Cherry.</p>
		<p>"OK Spill it Spam! I know you have to proofread the
			poems before they go out.  So you have to know who this 'Brooke
			Addict' is.  I do not have time for your lame excuses like 'it's
			against the rules of the paper,' or that you were sworn to secrecy or
			anything like that.  And don't give me any bull about 'journalistic
			integrity,' because we both know you haven't got any.  Plus, the less
			time I have to be near the lower class of the school the better.  I
			think you shed on my clothes or something."</p>
		<p>"First off, I do not shed, you moron.  Second, I am not in
			charge of the poems, Satan! So if you will excuse me, I'm going to my
			class now.  I wouldn't want you to be overexposed to us lower
			classes," Sam said as she pushed past Nicole and Lily followed.</p>
		<p>Brooke just watched her go for a minute then glared at
			Nicole before heading off toward her own class.</p>
		<p>Nicole just shrugged and went to her own class with a very
			quiet blonde shadow.</p>
		<p>The rest of the day went on about the same. Sam was trying to
			avoid questions about the paper, Lily was trying to convince Sam that
			she should continue to send more poems, Nicole and Mary Cherry were
			trying to find 'Brooke Addict,' and Brooke was watching everyone that
			was around Sam to see if she could find out who Sam's secret admirer
			was.</p>
		<p>Shannon stood in the shadows for most of the day watching
			Sam.  When Sam was walking home, she made her move.  She pulled up
			beside the brunette. </p>
		<p>"Hey there Gorgeous, want a ride?" she asked with a wink.  Sam
			excepted the ride with a blush and a shy 'thank you.'          </p>
		<p>"Why are you walking?" Shannon inquired as she made her
			way through the late afternoon traffic.</p>
		<p>"I told Brooke to go ahead home, I had to finish up
			something on the paper." She smiled to herself when she thought about
			the poem she put in this time. Lily talked her into at least posting
			one more to see if she got the same reaction. She chose a sexier one
			but edited it for school. It was one of her favorites.</p>
		<p>Shannon looked at her and smiled.</p>
		<p>"So since you didn't need me or Jason to help today, are you
			going to tomorrow? Because you know I am always willing to do
			anything for you." This last part was said in a tone that sent a
			chill down Sam's back. Sam looked at the other girl and the look in
			her eyes was unmistakably desire.  Sam didn't know what to say or do,
			so she opted for a quick and shy:</p>
		<p>"Thank you, I will keep that in mind," she finished with a
			smile and stared down at her hands for the rest of the ride home.</p>
		<p>Brooke was coming out of the kitchen when she heard
			laughter outside the front door.  She watched as it opened to reveal
			Sam and Shannon laughing and heading for the stairs and not even
			noticing her.</p>
		<p>Brooke felt a surge of jealousy and it bothered her.  She
			couldn't help the thoughts that were now making themselves known.</p>
		<p>"So that's why she didn't want you to drive her home.  She didn't
			need you, she had Shannon." She rolled her eyes and went into the
			living room to try and watch TV to change her mood.</p>
		<p>An hour later she heard the two laughing girls make their
			way back to the front door.  Brooke stood up and went over to them
			thinking bitterly (what could be so damn funny?)</p>
		<p>Sam noticed her first "Oh, hi Brooke. I didn't see you
			there." Brooke stared daggers at Shannon and said under her breath:</p>
		<p>"That's obvious" </p>
		<p>"What was that?" Sam asked totally missing what was said.</p>
		<p>"Nothing, So what was so funny?" She asked still not
			taking her eyes off Shannon.  Both Shannon and Sam noticed, but only
			Sam was puzzled by it.  (Brooke doesn't usually act hostile to
			anyone. Well, besides me)</p>
		<p>Just than the phone started ringing. </p>
		<p>"You wouldn't be interested," Sam said as she went to answer the
			phone.  She didn't realize her reluctance to share what their
			laughter was about would hurt Brooke's feelings, but it did.</p>
		<p>Shannon watched Sam go and then turned to Brooke and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Brooke, can I talk to you?" When Brooke shrugged and headed back
			to the coach, she followed. "I just wanted to ask you since you know
			Sam better than most, what would she like for Valentine's Day? Like
			what could I get her to make a lasting impression on her?"</p>
		<p>When Shannon asked those questions Brooke's eyes widened.</p>
		<p>"You're Sam's secret admirer, aren't you?" Now she knew why
			Shannon's presence was making her uncomfortable. At Shannon's nod she
			said, "Well, I don't know, but you are wasting your time. Sam isn't
			gay and if she was." She trailed off not even knowing what she was
			going to say.</p>
		<p>"'If she was' what? Would you go after her? Miss Queen of
			Popularity? Come on, Brooke, is that what you were going to say? You
			know it's written all over your face that you're jealous.  But would
			you be willing to put aside your throne for her? Think about it,
			Brooke.  Even if she isn't interested in me, I am willing to take
			that risk.  Are you? Well, all I can say, Brooke, is you better open
			your eyes before it's to late." </p>
		<p>Just when Brooke was about to speak Sam walked in. The
			first thing she noticed was the two girls glaring at each other, and
			the hostility in the air. </p>
		<p>"Ummm, Brooke that was your dad.  He said that we should order
			pizza for dinner and that they won't be home until late." Looking at
			Shannon, "Would you like to stay for dinner, Shannon?" she said
			hoping to dispel the tension.</p>
		<p>Without looking away from Brooke, Shannon replied.</p>
		<p>"No thank you, Sam. I was just leaving." Then with a slight
			smirk, "I have some shopping to do." Turning and giving Sam a full
			smile.  "I'll see you at school tomorrow." </p>
		<p>Not for the first time, Sam admired Shannon's beauty.  But
			she felt guilty, because as she did with everyone else, she compared
			her to Brooke. When the door shut she turned to Brooke and noticed
			Brooke was watching her reaction to Shannon and she couldn't help but
			blush. </p>
		<p>"What was that all about? Why did I come in here and it look like
			you two were about to start swinging?" </p>
		<p>Brooke looked back at the TV and just shrugged, her mind
			a whirlwind of confusion.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Sam, realizing she wasn't going to get an answer, threw
			up her hands and left the room to call Lily.</p>
