<p style="text-align:center;"><b>OVER THE EDGE<br>
EIGHT</b></p>
<p>Miley paced the length of her bedroom as Lilly lay sprawled out across her bed, her slim body managing to take up more than half of the mattress. As Miley paced, she could see out of the corner of her eye, glimpses of Lola's shiny clothes reflecting in the moonlight. It was quite distracting. She had changed out of Hannah's clothes after the concert when they switched cars, but she decided to wait on wearing pajamas. She knew that she'd wake the sleeping girl up if she started digging through her drawers now, and while she was a restless bundle of nerves, waking <i>Sleeping Beauty </i>was something she didn't want to do.</p>
<p>Lilly had fallen asleep on the way back from the concert, and though the girl had been pressed up against Miley the entire ride home, they hadn't yet had the chance to talk. And after almost a week of space and whatever the hell happened in her dressing room, Miley didn't know what to expect from Lilly. She was nervous, which meant two things. She couldn't sleep – especially not in a bed right next to Lilly, and she felt like she could eat the entire state of California if something didn't happen soon.</p>
<p>Miley's hand fell to her stomach as it rumbled softly beneath her palm. Yes, it was official – she had the munchies. Casting one last look at Lilly, Miley slipped out of her room, shutting the door softly behind her. After tip-toeing down the stairs, she walked into the kitchen. Neon-green numbers flashed at her from the stove: <i>11:23 PM.</i></p>
<p>The Stewart house was bathed in darkness, a single source of light lighting up the kitchen as Miley opened up the fridge, looking for anything to squash her monstrous appetite. With an irritated sigh, she decided on a sandwich or three. She reached into the fridge and pulled out some lunch meat and cheese and set them on the kitchen counter – the same counter Lilly had taken her against. Miley slapped her palm against her forehead and then placed both of her hands on the edge of the countertop, struggling to hold herself up.</p>
<p>"<i>I'm not doing anything to you. You're asking for this, Miles. You want me."</i></p>
<p>Miley squeezed her eyes shut and hung her head, feeling heat flood her cheeks. She could almost feel Lilly's hands on her like she was right there, those insanely talented fingers inside of her. She could only imagine what it would feel like to actually have Lilly doing those things to her.</p>
<p>"<i>I think I'm a liar when I say I don't want you."</i></p>
<p>And suddenly Lilly's hands <i>were</i> on her, slipping underneath her shirt and coming to a rest on her stomach, almost burning into her skin. The fridge door was still wide open, and a quick glance downward assured her that Lilly really was behind her. A familiar weight settled on her left shoulder and Miley turned her head slightly, sweetly pressing her lips against Lilly's warm cheek and letting them linger for a moment.</p>
<p>"What was that for?" Lilly asked quietly.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged one shoulder, smiling shyly. "Just because. When did you wake up?"</p>
<p>"Just a few minutes ago," The blonde answered. "I heard you leave the room and I figured you were down here trying to clean out your kitchen… What's going on in that head of yours, Miles?" Lilly wondered, withdrawing one of her hands and covering the spot above Miley's heart. "Could your heart beat any faster?"</p>
<p>"I doubt it." Miley muttered, embarrassed, "How'd you know I was down here?"</p>
<p>Lilly moved her hand down and underneath Miley's shirt. "You always eat more when you're nervous. I can't imagine why you'd be nervous. It's just me."</p>
<p>"That's exactly why." Miley breathed out. "Your hand next to my boobs didn't really help, either."</p>
<p>"Sorry." Lilly responded with a playful grin.</p>
<p>Miley knew Lilly wasn't sorry as she let one of her hands slide higher and higher, her fingertips dragging over her ribcage, just brushing against her bra before both of her hands left Miley's body completely.</p>
<p>"What was that for?" She asked, echoing Lilly's earlier words as she turned around. She immediately noticed that Lilly had changed out of Lola's sparkly clothes into her own – a pair of stylishly ripped jeans, a dark shirt with some band logo on the front, and her favorite dark blue hoodie.</p>
<p>"Just because." Lilly answered with a shrug before moving forward and hugging Miley, resting her chin on the brunette's shoulder.</p>
<p>"We still need to talk, Lilly." Miley said, wrapping her arms around the blonde and burying her face in Lilly's neck. Then she whined, "And you still haven't given me my birthday present. What's up with that?"</p>
<p>"I thought you turned eighteen, not eight." Lilly countered, clearly amused as she backed up. "Don't move."</p>
<p>Miley huffed and folded her arms across her chest as she watched Lilly throw the food she'd set out back into the fridge, then quietly shut the door. The room was once again engulfed in complete darkness, Miley's eyes seeing white as she blinked to adjust to the sudden change. She gave up her attempt to see through the thick darkness when she felt Lilly press against her entire front then move back a little.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what – you go out with me tonight, and I'll give it to you your present when we get back." Lilly whispered into Miley's ear, her hands on either side of the brunette's waist. Their bodies were separated by mere inches, Miley's lower back pressed up against the island. "Trust me, you don't want to pass this up. I promise, Miles."</p>
<p>"You mean like a date?" Miley asked, blindly reaching out to grab at Lilly. She grabbed a handful of Lilly's jacket.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled as her lips brushed against Miley's ear, her breaths hitting it in puffs. She felt Miley shudder beneath her. "Would you like it to be a date?" Then she pulled her head back to watch Miley's reaction through the darkness.</p>
<p>"I'd like that… a lot." Miley said softly and tugged on Lilly's jacket. "Would it be okay if I kissed you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." Lilly whispered back shyly, then added, "Please do."</p>
<p>Miley then pulled Lilly closer so she could kiss the blonde deeply. She arched herself into Lilly's front, satisfied when she heard a soft groan in return. Breaking away from the kiss, Miley whispered to her, "I really don't want my dad to catch us making out in the middle of the kitchen."</p>
<p>Lilly ignored her words and moved forward again, catching Miley's bottom lip between both of hers. Then she tilted her head and opened her mouth wider, slipping her tongue into Miley's mouth when she did the same. Miley groaned into the kiss, her chest swelling at the feelings Lilly was evoking inside of her. It was an amazing feeling, finally able to have Lilly's lips against hers for real. It was <i>nothing</i> like her dreams.</p>
<p>In fact, even as Lilly pinned Miley against the island, every trace of her dreams disappeared momentarily, overwhelmed by the real thing.</p>
<p>It was Lilly's turn to groan as Miley pressed her thigh against Lilly's center, feeling the heat between the blonde's legs through her jeans. Miley's hands came to rest on Lilly's lower back as she pulled the blonde closer, pulling her against her leg. Lilly gripped Miley's sides as she involuntarily bucked her hips at the contact, gasping at the unexpected jolt that shot through her.</p>
<p>"Jesus, Miles…" She gasped. "What is that?"</p>
<p>"Does it feel good?" Miley asked her quietly. She was quite amused at the effect she had on Lilly.</p>
<p>"Yes," Lilly admitted, turning a dark red. "So, please – stop that so we can go."</p>
<p>Miley smirked as she let Lilly go. "You started it, Lil. I was just going along with it."</p>
<p>"Well…" Lilly trailed off, unable to think of a comeback. "Are you still hungry?"</p>
<p>"Very." Miley answered, though she couldn't decide if she was hungry for food or for Lilly.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>"You've been holding out on me, Lillian." Miley said around a mouthful of French toast, playfully but gently nudging her friend in the ribs.</p>
<p>Lilly jerked at the contact, very nearly dropping the last bite of her cheeseburger. She narrowed her eyes at Miley, managing a quick, "Watch it, woman."</p>
<p>"Sorry." Miley grinned as she shoveled another forkful of food into her mouth, nearly moaning at the taste of it. After she chewed her food and swallowed it, she addressed Lilly again. "Seriously, Lils, how have I never been here before?"</p>
<p>Lilly turned her head and lifted an eyebrow. "Seriously, Miles," She echoed playfully, "It's just a diner."</p>
<p>"Yes, but this food is incredible… And it's gone." Miley looked sadly down at her empty plate, setting her fork down and pushing the plate away from her. "Is there anything else you've been keeping from me?"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to know?" Lilly countered with a smirk.</p>
<p>Miley twisted her body so she could look at Lilly. Her eyebrows knitted together in thought. "Yes. I would like to know."</p>
<p>Lilly sighed deeply, running a hand through her hair. "What do you want to know?"</p>
<p>"For starters…" Miley bit her bottom lip, then slowly released it. "I'd like to know how you feel about… what happened. I mean, I'd totally understand if you… saw me as someone different than your best friend."</p>
<p>"Who would I see you as?" Lilly asked.</p>
<p>"Someone that can't control herself," Miley answered, hanging her head, "As someone who took advantage of you… as a monster."</p>
<p>Lilly wiped her hands on her jeans before lifting them to cup Miley's cheeks. "You are not a monster, Miley." She said firmly, ducking her head as she tried to meet Miley's eyes. "You didn't take advantage of me. I had the choice to leave you there or wake you up and… let you take care of the problem yourself. But, I didn't. Actually, I think that maybe I was the one who took advantage of the situation."</p>
<p>Miley then lifted her eyes to meet Lilly's. "Don't say that."</p>
<p>"Why can't I? You said the same thing." Lilly told her, running her thumbs along the other girl's cheeks. "I don't want you to blame yourself for something you couldn't control."</p>
<p>"But I could control it, Lilly." Miley argued back, her eyes stinging with unshed tears. Guilt was tearing through her, overpowering her other emotions as she knew she was wrong.</p>
<p>She felt weak. She tried to keep herself awake so she could stop having such dirty dreams about her best friend. She wanted to rid herself of those thoughts so she could go back to having a normal relationship with Lilly. But she couldn't control it. She could have, however, controlled the way she acted when she woke up with Lilly standing over her. She didn't <i>have</i> to be aggressive and force Lilly into anything.</p>
<p>"No, you couldn't. You tried to stop the dreams, but you can't control the fact that whenever you close your eyes you have dreams about me." Lilly responded softly, "You can't control <i>me</i>, either. You didn't force me to do anything. Everything that happened in your dressing room was mutual. Believe me, Miley, I wanted it just as much as you did."</p>
<p>"Do you still want that?" Miley whispered brokenly, "Do you – do you want <i>me</i>?"</p>
<p>Lilly didn't answer verbally. Instead, she leaned forward and kissed Miley gently. Miley's heart swelled in her chest as her unshed tears slid down her cheeks at the soft reassurance.</p>
<p>"Yes, Miley." Lilly whispered lovingly against her lips. "I want you."</p>
