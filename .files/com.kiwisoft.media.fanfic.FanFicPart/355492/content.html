<!-- Going Through The Motions \ Part 5 -->

<p>Sam wants me to go to school with her. She says it's for my own
good. But I can't. Not today. What if she calls and I'm not
here?</p>

<p>"What if she calls and you are here?", Sam says. I shrug,
"Besides, do you really think she won't call again if no one
answers?"</p>

<p>How should I know?, "Sam, I won't leave the house. You are
wasting your time."</p>

<p>Sam's not happy. I'm not happy. No one is happy. But
that's just the way it is. I would like to make her happy.
Because, if I realized one thing last night, it's that Sam is
just about the best human being I've ever known. She deserves
better than what I'm giving. She deserves better than what the
world is giving her. But life isn't fair, you just take
what's in your reach and make it matter. Or you lie down and wait
for it all to end.</p>

<p>Finally Sam gives up and leaves. She's frustrated that after last
night I've reverted back to the zombie-state. Well, I'm not
that bad anymore. I actually answered some of her questions. I ate
breakfast. And I almost jumped through the roof when the phone rang.
But I'm sure Sam was hoping for a full recovery after last night.
She's not the patient type. Sure she'll keep at it until she
gets what she wants, but she's always pressing for quick results.</p>

<p>I spend the day watching tv, lying by the pool and reading. Three of
my favorite waste of times. The phone rings three times, none of them
are her. One of the calls is for me though. It's from school,
they want to know if I'm okay. Isn't that sweet. I'm fine,
just a little feverish. I'll be in school tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Saturday? I'll be in Monday then. Bye. Thanks for
caring.</p>

<p>Jessica comes home around two. I have no idea where she's been. I
didn't even know she ever left the house, "Has she called
then?", I shake my head. She nods, "Mark said it could be a
few days before he hears from her."</p>

<p>Mark?, "Who is this Mark anyway?"</p>

<p>"Look, I know about as much as you do, Brooke. She just gave me
his number onetime and said that if I ever needed to reach her Mark
could help. She said that she calls him at least once a week", oh
great, "I've never even met him."</p>

<p>Okay.. this is so weird, "Why the hell is she so.. so..
why..", I have no words. I don't know how to say it. Why oh,
why has she never gotten in touch with me during these years? What
possible reason could there be?</p>

<p>Jessica sees me hurting and moves closer. She tries to enwrap me into
a hug, but I pull away, "Brooke..", she starts.</p>

<p>"Call him again", I say hiding behind the wall. I can't
show the hurt. It's private. Jessica opens her mouth to protest,
but I'm having none of that, "Call. Him. Again", I use my
ice cold stare to strengthen the words.</p>

<p>And it works again. She takes the phone from the table and dials. I
don't remove my eyes from her for a second. I don't even
blink, "I don't know what you hope to gain by this
Brooke", she says after a few seconds. I don't answer. I
don't have an answer.</p>

<p>Another ten seconds goes by before finally someone picks up,
"Yeah hi", Jessica says, "It's Jessica, Sarah's
sister. Yes, I called yesterday, but... what?", she glances at me
and then turns away, "I don't think... no. Yes, I'm sure.
Look could you just give me a number where I can reach her?",
Jessica raises her hand and brushes it through her hair once,
"Fine. I said fine. Bye."</p>

<p>She knows. She called him and now she knows. She knows and she just
doesn't care, "She had called him already, right?",
Jessica turns to look at me and hesitates. She's trying to decide
whether to lie or not, "Oh my god! She called."</p>

<p>"Brooke, don't read too much into this", Jessica says. I
hardly even hear her. Things are jumping around in my head,
"Maybe she's just gathering up her nerve. It's not easy
to make such a call after all this time."</p>

<p>Yeah right. And if I know my mother at all she's gona take the
easy way out and not call, "She's not gona call", I say.
But it feels like someone else is talking and I'm just listening
to her, "She knows dad is dead. She knows I'm all alone and
she's not even gona call."</p>

<p>"You don't know that Brooke", Jessica tries to delay the
inevitable. She has to know her sister well enough to know that she
won't call, "And even if she doesn't, you're not
alone. You have me Brooke. And you have Sam", and there comes the
preparation for the inevitable. So it won't hit so hard when it
finally strikes.</p>

<p>She advances towards me again ready to give me a comforting hug.
Again. And again I step away, "Please save your `I love you
Brooke' speech. I already got it from Sam last night", I spit
out in a bitter voice. I don't mean to, but I'm hurting,
"It's funny how you only tell me it as a last resort. Somehow
that eats away all it's credibility."</p>

<p>She shuts up. Half a minute goes by and I turn to leave. I have to
lie down or I'll faint. When I'm almost out of the room my
aunts voice reaches me once more, "Even if you don't believe
me, you should believe Sam. Why would she have stuck around here if
she didn't love you? There's nothing else in here for
her."</p>

<p>I push the words out of my mind. Don't need them messing around
in there, the place is in ruins as it is. They leave without putting
up much of a fight. But they are clever words, they leave behind this
trace. This thought. And the thought is much more effective than the
words could've ever been. The thought grows slowly. And
there's no way to get rid of it. It's like a parasite, it
feeds on my mind. So I do the only thing I can. I bury it under an
even bigger thought.</p>

<p>My mother. My EVIL mother. How could she do it? How could she leave
me? How could she go on for eight years without so much as a card?
And now the biggest insult of all, how can she NOT even call after I
lost my father? It just hurts so much. It hurts even more than losing
dad. And that's a lot. That's more than my little heart can
take. It's beating on overdrive, and if I don't calm down soon
it's gona break. I'm gona die of a heart attack at the age of
seventeen! I know I am. Everything goes black, and I know I'm
gona die. My feet give out from under me, and I know I'm gona
die. I hit my head into something hard. And I know I'm gona die.</p>
