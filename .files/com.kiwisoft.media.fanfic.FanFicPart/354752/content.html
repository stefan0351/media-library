<!-- Trick or Treat \ Part 3 -->

<p>Within 15 minutes the Captain had ordered down the red alert when it seemed
that Voyager was no longer in any danger. What ever happened it seemed was over
just as quickly as it had begun.</p>

<p>As soon as B'Elanna could see again after being blinded by that light she
had dragged Seven down to engineering with her, and quite literally at that. It
seemed that Seven wasn't up to moving at all from her spot on the floor after
falling when the ship was rocked. The engineer nearly carried Seven all the way
which was odd in and of itself but when they had both arrived in the engine
room Seven had wondered off to a dark corner by herself. She never even tried
to butt in to help discover what had happened and for some odd reason seemed to
avoid all bright light and that was what tipped B'Elanna off that something was
just not right. As B'Elanna worked to try and figure out what had happened she
kept a close eye on the borg not yet ready to make a scene and drag Seven to sickbay.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later and the red alert was cancelled but she was still no
closer to figuring out what had happened. Nothing came up on the damned sensors
and the ship was undamaged so why were the hairs on the back of her neck
standing up. Looking up she saw Seven hunched over a console gripping it
tightly and shaking slightly. Concerned, B'Elanna rushed over to see what was
going on. Just as the Lieutenant had reached her, Seven stopped shaking. Rather
than call for an emergency beam out, B'Elanna decided to ask Seven if she were
okay. Putting her hand on Seven's bare arm, she was surprised to find it so
cold. But what surprised her even more was when Seven grabbed her wrist, turned
her around, and slammed her back up against the wall. Before she could react,
Seven closed the remaining distance so that most of their bodies were rubbing
against each other. Seven than dipped her head and began to lick B'Elanna's
neck just above the pulse point in small sensual circles.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, what in Kahless's name, are you doing?&quot; B'Elanna managed
to croak out in between gasps.</p>

<p>Seven stopped her licking and brought her face even with B'Elanna's but her
nails continued the assault on her neck by ever so lightly scratching at the
skin. That's when B'Elanna saw something she hadn't seen before. Forget the
fact that Seven's eyes were now golden and she wasn't wearing any contacts but
Seven's eyes held a passion, a desire that made B'Elanna's knees go weak.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you, B'Elanna. I need to taste you.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven's voice held so much desire in it that B'Elanna could do nothing but
close her eyes and let whatever happen, happen. That's when B'Elanna missed
Seven baring her new sharp and long fangs preparing to feast on that supple
neck right in front of her. The next thing B'Elanna knew was that Seven had
fallen limp in her arms and the moment had been broken. Looking up as she
guided Seven to the floor she saw Lieutenant Vorik aiming a phaser at the two
of them.</p>

<p>Within the next two hours an emergency staff meeting was called. Noticeably
missing from the senior staff was Seven, Chakotay, Paris, and Neelix who were
all being detained in sickbay. All dressed in uniforms again, the Captain began
the meeting.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Doctor. Tell us what you have.&quot; Janeway asked with her
command mask fully in place to hide the worry she felt.</p>

<p>&quot;Not much, I'm afraid. It seems that the crew who are in sickbay right
now seem to have taken on the personalities of their costumes. They aren't just
acting like who they pretended to be but they have literally become those
people or monsters as the case may be. I have no cause nor a cure for this
epidemic but it does seem to be limited to the crew in sickbay. What I can tell
you is that it seems to be linked to that bright light we encountered before.
All the cases occurred within 15 minutes of that event, with Seven being the
last case to be brought in. The only commonality between each individual is
that they were all still wearing their Halloween costumes.</p>

<p>&quot;But I was still dressed in my costume at the time so why didn't I turn
into an amazon?&quot; B'Elanna questioned angrily, still very much worried
about Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;As far as I can tell, this thing seems to be random the only
requirement was wearing a costume at the time.&quot; Doc answered as best he
could. Even he was stumped by this.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Doctor for your input. I would like to be kept up on the
patients' conditions and expect frequent reports.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, right now the only lead we have into this mysterious illness is
our other mystery. Harry any ideas on that bright light we experienced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None, Captain. The sensors didn't pick up any thing unusual as if it
had never even happened and nothing like this has ever been recorded before. I
don't know what to tell you&quot; a distraught Harry explained.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, fine. Does anyone have anything they wish to add? No? Then I
want everyone working on finding out something, anything about our two
mysteries. Use every trick in the book if you have to but I want answers AND
solutions. Dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p>The Captain sighed. 'Why can't anything ever be easy'.</p>

<p>Later that morning just as the alpha shift was beginning, Janeway was called
down to sickbay.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Captain. All the signs of being a vampire have disappeared from
Seven. She no longer has fangs or glowing eyes or even a desire to hide from
light. It appears she's cured.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how, why?&quot; The Captain was relieved but still concerned.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe that my nanoprobes had something to do with it but are
unsure as to how or why.&quot; Seven answered for the Doc.</p>

<p>Seven didn't want to stay in sickbay a moment longer and hoped to convince
Janeway that she was alright.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, I would like Seven to regenerate considering she hasn't done
so for 48 hours and I will be monitoring her through a cortical monitor and at
the slightest change will bring her back in.&quot; The Doctor said as he placed
the monitor on Seven's neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, Doctor. I will leave the decision up to you.&quot; Janeway
agreed.</p>

<p>And with that Seven was out the door before you could say vampire coming
through. The Doctor then went about checking up on his other patients who all
remained sedated on biobeds. The Captain decided to head back to the bridge for
the remainder of her shift.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Seven headed straight for the cargo bay wanting to start her
regeneration cycle as soon as possible. The sooner she did that the sooner she
would stop thinking about what had taken place between her and Lieutenant
Torres. Every time she would think about licking that beautiful neck she'd feel
this all too familiar ache and then she would think about how repulsed B'Elanna
would be if she ever found out that Seven had feelings for her. These feelings
were all too new for Seven and she just didn't know what to do, say, or even
think. Seven entered the cargo bay and instructed the computer for an eight
hour regeneration cycle. Seven knew she couldn't hide from B'Elanna forever and
had to apologize for her behavior but she wasn't ready to face the Klingon yet.
'Perhaps after my cycle is complete I will go to astrometrics and try to help find
what caused the phenomenon of the mysterious light.' Nothing like good old
avoidance. And with that, Seven stepped into the alcove intending to wake
during the gamma shift, long after B'Elanna is in bed. Little did Seven know
that B'Elanna had plans of her own.</p>

<p>&quot;Regeneration Cycle complete.&quot; The computer intoned.</p>

<p>Seven stepped out of the alcove, a seemingly unconscious act, and had yet to
open her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven? Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna who had been standing there for some time watching Seven 'sleep'
was concerned when Seven didn't open her eyes. She stepped closer to Seven and
put her hand on Seven's arm. That's when Seven opened her eyes to reveal their
golden color and smiled a very sexy smile down at B'Elanna showing her fangs.
For the second time in as many days, B'Elanna was dumb struck and could not
move or let alone think. She was surprised yet again when Seven grabbed her and
together the fell to the floor. Seven was now lying atop B'Elanna and sensually
moving her hands up and down the engineer's body. The only thing B'Elanna could
do was moan and arch her body into Seven's caresses. Seven was even more
aroused by B'Elanna's response and began to kiss her chin making her way down
to her neck ever so slowly. B'Elanna was in heaven and began to feel a tingle
all over her body. Briefly she opened her eyes and realized that the tingle was
actually caused by a transport and that she was now in sickbay. Soon after that
realization she saw the Doctor put a hypospray to Seven's neck and Seven fell
limply onto her body for a second time. 'I wish people would stop interfering'.
B'Elanna whined to herself. She really needed to have a talk with Seven, now
more than, ever but first they had to find a cure for her. And with that last
thought B'Elanna helped the Doctor lift Seven onto an empty biobed.</p>
