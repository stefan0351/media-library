<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 5 -->

<p><b>2002 - Evanston, Illinois</b></p>

<p>Katie sighed deeply, rolling her head to the side and
letting it hang there limply for a few seconds before mustering up the energy to
straighten her neck up again. She was still for a moment longer, and then she brought her
right hand up to face and rubbed at her eyes wearily, sighing once again.</p>

<p>"It's not like I'm dying," she said
softly turning to face Jessie. "I wouldn't have...I
didn't...they're making me go," she continued dropping her head back
down.</p>

<p>"I know," Jessie said drawing her legs up and
wrapping her arms around them, squeezing them into her body protectively. "It just
feels like..."</p>

<p>"I know," Katie interjected restlessly, uncurling
her long limbs and standing up. "I know, I know, I know," she repeated touchily
jumping up and down on the spot. "I know," she finished moving to sit back down
beside Jessie.</p>

<p>Jessie looked over at her, not at all surprised by her
girlfriends outburst. Katie had a tendency to just spontaneously erupt into motion
whenever she was forced to stay still for too long, like the enormous amounts of energy
that her body produced just had to vent a little or she'd go crazy. Usually it
manifested itself, in dance moves - like that day they had waltzed through the
hallways?or humorous kung fu demonstrations, and other times like just now Jessie
wished she had a foam bat that she could give to her so that she could really let off some
steam.</p>

<p>"It's just going to be different, that's
all," Katie said finally, her eyes drifting over to Jessie.</p>

<p>"I know," Jessie murmured, her chin still resting
on her knees as her eyes scanned the darkness of the Manning backyard.
"Different," she continued softly, her eyes closing. She didn't want things
to be different she liked things the way there were. Whenever something
'different' had ever occurred in her life, it was always a bad
'different'. It was just a more pleasant way of being told that you could kiss
the things you liked goodbye.</p>

<p>Katie turned her head away from Jessie and tipped it up
looking at the stars above, inhaling deeply. She didn't want this anymore than Jessie
did. She liked things the way they were, and if she gotten to choose she would've
kept things the way they were, but she didn't get to choose. She had told her parents
that she didn't want to apply to schools out of state, let alone out of the country,
but it had been a family tradition to attend university in the United Kingdom. Her fathers
side of the family had come from there, and been born and breed there, and her brothers
had all gone, at least for their undergraduate degrees. So, once St. Andrew's had
accepted her, there was no chance of her not going unless she wanted to be disowned and
end up living in a box somewhere downtown.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Jessie said a moment later
drawing Katie's attention back over to her.</p>

<p>"For what?" Katie asked curiously wondering if
she had missed part of Jessie's statement.</p>

<p>"I know I'm being an ass about this," she
replied knowing that being sullen and feeling sorry for herself wasn't helping the
situation any.</p>

<p>"You're not being an ass," Katie said
reaching over and taking her hand, squeezing it lightly. "But even if you were you
wouldn't have to apologize for it," she continued dropping her eyes. "I
know this sucks, I know that."</p>

<p>"I just," Jessie started shifting closer to
Katie. "I can't imagine what it's going to be like not being able to see
you everyday, or call you whenever I want, or run over to your house on 'pie
night' to avoid becoming 'crinkly crust' girl," she continued resting
her head on Katie's shoulder as the dirty blonde wrapped an arm around her waist.</p>

<p>"I know," Katie responded simply, rather at a
loss as to what else she could say. She would miss seeing Jessie everyday too, and calling
and being called whenever the whim hit them. She'd miss having Jessie run over to her
house to escape whatever obtuse torture was being inflicted upon her at her homes, and
she'd miss getting to hang out with Jessie's families since they'd become
like an extension of her own. She was over at the Manning house so much that she literally
had a chair with her name on it, and at Karen's house there was a cupboard that the
woman had stocked with all the foods Katie liked for when she came over. This was her
life, and she didn't want to leave it.</p>

<p>Jessie shifted in Katie's arms, moving around until
she was kneeling in front of her girlfriend, and then reached down and picked up
Katie's hands holding them in hers tightly.</p>

<p>"I need to be with you," she said softly, her
eyes never leaving Katie's.</p>

<p>"Your parents are home," Katie said her eyes
flickering towards the house momentarily before returning to Jessie's.</p>

<p>Jessie was silent for a moment as she considered the truth
of Katie's statement, her eyes clouding over as she thought before they finally
cleared as she focused on Katie once more. "You brought your car didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie responded slowly, her mind taking a
second to catch onto what Jessie was suggesting. "You're not serious?" she
continued smiling as she looked at Jessie's twinkling eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," Jessie responded leaning forward so that
her mouth was right next to Katie's ear. "I am."</p>

<p>"Do you want to drive somewhere or ... " Katie
started to ask as Jessie stood up offering her hand to her.</p>

<p>"Take to long," Jessie replied simply holding
onto Katie's hand and leading them over to the side of the garage where Katie had
parked.</p>

<p>"Ok," Katie agreed smiling, more than happy to
let Jessie led the way. "But I get to be Kate Winslet."</p>
