<p>Things settled down for awhile and Buffy and
Willow decided that the time was right for the next logical step in their life together,
telling Willow's parents.</p>

<p>Picking one of the rare instances when both her
parents were home they waked hand in hand up to the Rosenberg front door. Things went down
hill from there. Buffy never did find out whether it was because she was female, a
gentile, a bad influence, her family being split, or her genetics but what ever it was,
Willow's parents went totally off the deep end.</p>

<p>There was crying, screaming, yelling,
recriminations, and finally the ultimatum. Willow's father told her that either she gave
up Buffy and come home until they could arrange for her to transfer to another school far
away, or she would pack her belongings and get out of his house and never come back.</p>

<p>Willow broke into tears and ran upstairs to her
room, Buffy followed her but couldn't get past the door because Willow had locked it.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>&#147;Willow..baby talk to me.&#148; Buffy
called through the door her only answer was the sound of Willow crying. &#147;I'll be
right here if you need me.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy sat down on the hall floor and leaned back
against the door. She could still hear Willow moving around in her room still crying and
she could still hear Mr. Rosenberg ranting about how the godless gentiles were going to
destroy the Jewish people by corrupting their young people, Mrs. Rosenberg was wailing
hysterically wondering where she went wrong.</p>

<p>Finally Willow opened the door. Buffy stood up and
looked into Willow's red rimmed green eyes. She saw the anguish of loss in those eyes, but
also her resolve.</p>

<p>&#147;Buffy can you help me?&#148; Willow asked
indicating three large suitcases on her bed. &#147;If you'll get those I'll carry the
backpack and duffle bag. I guess I'll have to rent a storage unit for the rest of my
things.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;It'll be alright Wills.&#148; Buffy said
reaching up to caress Willow's tear stained cheek. &#147;We'll get this to mom's she's got
plenty of room.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow pulled back from the hand and went back
into the room. They gathered Willow's things and went down stairs. When they got
downstairs Willow stepped into the living room to face her parents one last time.
&#147;I'm leaving like you said father.&#148; Willow said quietly and calmly &#147;I'm
sorry you both are too small minded to accept me as I am.&#148;</p>

<p>She turned and left before either of her parents
could say anything and Buffy took her place.</p>

<p>&#147;What you're making her do is wrong Mr.
Rosenberg,&#148; Buffy said, contempt dripping like venom from her words &#147;No one
should have to do what you've forced Willow to do. She loves you both but that isn't
enough for you.&#148;

</p><hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Buffy turned and hurried after Willow. That night
when Buffy tried to go to their dorm room she found that some of their liberal minded
fellow students had broken in and trashed their room. The university promised to look into
it but Buffy could tell that none of the smirking campus cops were going to exert
themselves but at least the university's insurance was going to pay for their personal
belongings and their room would be fully repaired.</p>

<p>It didn't make them feel any better or safer, so
at Buffy's mother's insistence they moved into her house and she drove them to classes
every morning.</p>

<p>All this brought a change in Willow and not in a
good way. Her normally bright and cheerful personality was gone, she didn't eat, she
didn't sleep and what was worse was every time Buffy would reach out for her she would
stiffen up and become totally unresponsive. After a while Buffy quit reaching for her and
began sleeping on the couch in the living room.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>&#147;I don't know what to do,&#148;
Buffy told Giles one afternoon after a particularly bad work out. &#147;All she does is
sit there staring out into space, she won't talk to me or let me do anything to help her.
It's making me crazy, sometimes I just want to pick her up and shake her.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I doubt seriously if that would help.&#148;
Giles told her &#147;All I can tell you is give her some time. She has suffered a
devastating loss and that may take her a while to get over it. Be patient with her and
love her she will come around soon enough. In the mean time pay attention to what you are
doing so you will live that long.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yeah right.&#148; she answered
absentmindedly.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>The problem was not getting better and it was
beginning to effect Buffy's slaying. Then came the day it almost killed her.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>The sun had been up for nearly an hour and
still Buffy hadn't come home. Joyce was going crazy with worry. Someone starting pounding
on the front door Joyce heard Willow say she would get it so she went ahead making
breakfast for her wayward daughter.</p>

<p>&#147;BUFFY&#148; she heard Willow scream.</p>

<p>Joyce dropped the bowl of pancake batter on the
floor and ran toward the sound. As she entered the living room she saw Xander carrying the
limp form of her daughter to the couch and lay her down.</p>

<p>&#147;I found her just outside the cemetery
gate,&#148; he said.</p>

<p>&#147;Where were you?&#148; Willow asked with a
hard edge to her voice. &#147;Weren't you supposed to patrol with her last night.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I did, I mean I was,&#148; He explained
quickly. &#147;We finished our sweep and she sent me home. She said something about not
wanting to go home yet and that she was going to take a walk. I just happened to go back
because I forgot my jacket and I found her and got her to my car. I called Giles on the
way over here and he said he'd be right over.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Alright you did the right thing, so lets get
busy.&#148; Willow said taking charge, &#147;Xander you go get some hot water and cloths.
I'll get the first-aid kit.&#148;</p>

<p>Joyce watched Willow take charge of
everything and before she could go to her daughter's side Willow was back with a big
military style first-aid bag. With an efficiency acquired through experience Willow began
cutting away Buffy's blood soaked clothes from her wounds, exposing a bone deep cut down
her side along her ribs some deep scratches all over her back and shoulders all of which
were bloody but not serious.</p>

<p>The ones that worried Willow were the deep gash
across Buffy's stomach and the large lump on the side of her head that was cut open and
matted her soft blonde hair with blood.</p>

<p>Xander returned with a huge bowl of hot water and
a pile of soft clean rags that had once been his shirt.</p>

<p>With the help of Buffy's mother Willow soon had
the smaller wounds cleaned and dressed and was moving to the more serious ones, she began
with the wound on Buffy's stomach cleaning it and putting in the necessary stitches like
Giles and Brigit had taught her. Willow was just finishing cleaning Buffy's head wound
when Giles walked in carrying some special medicines he and Willow had learned from the
book they'd brought back with them.</p>

<p>Willow stepped back to let Giles get to
Buffy's side and finish treating her.</p>

<p>&#147;Does this happen often?&#148; Joyce asked
after observing Willow's skill.</p>

<p>&#147;Never this bad before.&#148; Willow said her
voice breaking &#147;This is my fault.&#148;</p>

<p>Joyce stared at the girl as she backed out
of the room and into the hallway. She kept backing until her back was against a wall then
she slid down the wall to sit on the floor, she drew up her knees and hugged them tightly
against her chest. She wept quietly, Xander heard her and tried his best to console her.</p>

<p>&#147;No way Will,&#148; he said. &#147;If it's
anybody's fault it's mine I shouldn't have left her alone no matter what she said.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No Xander,&#148; Willow corrected him softly
&#147;I let her down. It's my place to be there for her, to help her face her enemies and
I didn't. I was too busy feeling sorry for poor pitiful little me. I wasn't there for the
one I love.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Your wrong Willow.&#148; Xander scolded her
&#147;Buffy knew you were hurting, she told me herself. She said she was afraid she wasn't
there for you because she couldn't seem to help you.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow was shaking her head in denial. Xander
slammed his fist into the floor. &#147;DAMN IT!&#148; Xander growled at his life long
friend. &#147;I'm so tired of both of you taking the blame for all this when you both know
whose fault it really is.&#148;</p>

<p>Willow looked up at him shocked by his unexpected
outburst. &#147;What are you saying?&#148; Willow asked in a tiny frightened voice.</p>

<p>&#147;You damn well know whose fault it is.&#148;
Xander said his voice low and full of deadly menace, &#147;If your parents are such narrow
minded bigots that they can't recognize that their daughter's in love just because she
happened to fall in love with another woman. Face it Will, it's their fault.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;No Xander,&#148; Willow said softly,
&#147;you don't understand it was me. I'm supposed to be above all that and when things
got a little rough I pulled away from her. I deserted Buffy and made her feel she wasn't
important to me and that's my fault and no one else.&#148;</p>

<p>Before Xander could answer Giles came out of the
living room. &#147;I have applied the medicine as the book instructed&#148; he said,
&#147;All we can do now is wait and see.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Wills.&#148; came a weak call from the
living room.</p>

<p>Before anyone else could react Willow was off the
floor and rushing to Buffy's side. She knelt on the floor beside the couch and took
Buffy's hand. &#147;I'm right here sweetheart.&#148; Willow reassured her &#147;I won't
leave your side again. I'm sorry I let you down, it won't ever happen I swear it.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;It's alright Wills, I'm gonna be fine&#148;
Buffy whispered. &#147;It's not your fault, it's mine, you've given up so much for me. I'm
sorry I cost you your family, I didn't mean to.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;THAT&quot;S IT!!! I've had just about
enough!&#148; Joyce snapped angrily. &#147;Willow you stay here with Buffy you're all she
needs right now. Xander you stay here and do whatever Willow tells you to. Rupert, you
come with me, we have something to take care of that can't wait another second.&#148;</p>

<p>Joyce grabbed her purse and with Giles in tow she
swept out of the house. She was gone for almost four hours and when she returned she was
closely followed by a very subdued and very apologetic Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg.</p>

<p>At Joyce's suggestion Willow and her parents went
into the dining room and had a long private talk. By the time they left they had made a
happily beaming Willow promise that when Buffy was better they were come to dinner so they
could get to know her better.</p>

<p>When Buffy questioned her mother about what she
had said that had made them come around, she would smile mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#147;Sometimes only another parent can explain
the facts of life to a parent&#148; she said vaguely, &#147;and sometimes it takes an
outsider to point out how truly lucky other people are.&#148;</p>
