<!-- More Than Words \ Part 4 -->

<P>Willow paced around their dorm room. It seemed to be a
pattern with her lately. Pacing and waiting for Buffy. Truthfully she could do
without it, it was shooting her nerves to hell. She sighed and walked over to
Buffy's side of the room. Picking Mr. Gordo up off of the Buffy's desk, Willow
walked over to Buffy's bed and lay down on it. She really needed to be
surrounded by all things Buffy at the moment, at least until the real thing got
back. </P>
<P>At any other place, at any other time, her mind would have
been on the amazing power she was able to summon earlier on with Tara-from her
Wicca groups-help. It was more than just the fact that they were able to move
the vending machine, it was also the feelings that coursed through her when
their powers joined together. It was amazing, it made every nerve ending in her
body feel alive. They only time anything had ever made her feel like that was
when she and Buffy kissed. It had been a pretty eventful night for her. New
super cool Wicca power, and Buffy kissing. If it wasn't for the fact that people
all around town were getting their hearts cut out, she would have considered
this one of the best nights of her life. Well, the fact that people were getting
their hearts cut out, and that her ankle hurt like a bitch. On the bright side,
she had gotten her voice back which meant that Buffy had succeeded and that
meant that she wasn't dead.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy walked quickly towards her room. All she wanted to do
was get in there and make sure that Willow was okay. Well, that and take her
into her arms and never let her go. The night had gone as well as could be hoped
for except for the fact that Riley now knew her secret-well not really, but he
knew that she wasn't who she seemed to be, and that was enough of a cause for
concern. However, it went two ways and she now knew that he was part of the
militia group that was horning in on her territory, and had neutered Spike. This
would no doubt have repercussions later on, but Buffy didn't want to think about
Riley, or the militia, or most of all Spike. All she wanted to do was go home
and see Willow. </P>
<P>Opening the door, Buffy saw Willow lying on her bed holding
Mr. Gordo tightly to her chest. The hackers eyes were closed and she looked so
peaceful that Buffy almost thought that she was asleep. That brief thought was
banished from her mind, however, when Willow opened her eyes and sat up smiling.
</P>
<P>"Buffy," she said putting Mr. Gordo down on the bed and
moving to stand up. </P>
<P>Buffy smiled. </P>
<P>"It is so good to hear your voice," Buffy said reverently
walking over to her. </P>
<P>"Not as good as it is to hear yours," Willow countered
smiling. "Besides I've been hearing my voice for eighteen/nineteen years now.
It's kind of losing it's thrill," she continued walking into Buffy's open arms.
</P>
<P>"Not for me," Buffy said enveloping Willow into her embrace.
</P>
<P>"I'm glad you're not dead," Willow whispered into Buffy's
ear as they held each other. </P>
<P>Buffy laughed and drew Willow closer. </P>
<P>"So am I Will, so am I," she responded running her fingers
through Willow's hair. </P>
<P>A few moments later they drew away from each other backing
up so that they could see the others face. After a moment of this Buffy closed
the distance between them bringing their faces so close together that their
noses were touching but she stopped there and their lips hovered close to each
other almost touching but not quite. </P>
<P>Willow opened her mouth to say something, but whatever it
was never got said because Buffy finally moved the last few centimeters to
Willow's lips and snared her lips. Willow moaned into her mouth and deepened
their kiss as their hands started to roam each others bodies. </P>
<P>"Uh," Willow groaned as Buffy broke the contact between them
pulling back. </P>
<P>"Does that mean you liked it?" Buffy asked a playful smile
working it's way across her face. </P>
<P>"Uh, yeah," Willow responded reaching out for the Slayer.
Buffy shifted slightly avoiding her hand. "What are you doing?" Willow whined.
</P>
<P>"Would you like a little cheese to go along with that
whine?" Buffy asked still smiling. </P>
<P>"That's original," Willow responded. "I like you better when
you couldn't speak," Willow continued grumbling. </P>
<P>Buffy smiled and moved closer to Willow again taking her
hand in hers. </P>
<P>"Trust me, I would like nothing more that to continue with
what we were doing," Buffy whispered into Willow's air. "My body temp. is
somewhere up there with the Sahara desert, meaning way up there," Buffy
continued nuzzling Willow ear a bit. "But…" </P>
<P>"No buts," Willow said softly moving her body against
Buffy's. </P>
<P>"Willow," Buffy groaned deep in her throat. She was trying
to say something important. She exactly remember what it was just then, but is
was important she was sure of that. "No," Buffy said trying to move away a
little. </P>
<P>"Yes," Willow said not letting her move away. </P>
<P>"Yes?" Buffy asked. She liked that answer a whole lot
better. She hadn't pictured Willow as being this controlling, she liked it
though. In fact she was liking it a WHOLE lot at the moment. </P>
<P>"Yes," Willow confirmed. </P>
<P>"No," Buffy said managing to get some blood flowing back to
her brain. "We've got to talk." </P>
<P>Willow stopped what she was doing. </P>
<P>"I know," she responded pulling back so that Buff could see
her. "I just like doing this," she continued in that sexy grin of hers. Buffy's
resolve nearly dissolved at that sight. Sometimes she wondered if Willow had any
idea how truly, utterly, effortlessly sexy she was. </P>
<P>"I'm liking it a whole lot too," Buffy said trying to fight
back the urge to just go ahead and kiss her. </P>
<P>"Space...between us," Willow started. "Would probably be a
good idea," she continued fighting her own urges and only succeeding partially.
</P>
<P>"You know what the problem is?" Buffy asked running her hand
up Willow's side. </P>
<P>"What?" Willow asked her breath catching a bit. </P>
<P>"We waited way, way, way, way, way…did I mention way? …too
long to do this," Buffy said planting a soft kiss on Willow's lips. "Now, well,
now we just can't control ourselves." </P>
<P>"And control is good?" Willow asked. She was thinking that
at the moment lack of control was feeling very good. </P>
<P>"What?" Buffy asked kissing along Willow's jaw-line.
</P>
<P>"I don't know," Willow said turning her head to pull Buffy
into a kiss. </P>
<P>"Wait," Buffy said carefully disengaging herself from
Willow's mouth. "Talk, we're suppose to be talking," she said backing up and
putting some space between them. If she stayed that close to Willow's body
they'd never get to the talking. </P>
<P>Willow gave her a pouty look but didn't disagree.
</P>
<P>"Okay then," Buffy said. "It's settled, talking there shall
be," she continued. "Let's move over to the beds." </P>
<P>Willow smiled and started to follow her. </P>
<P>"Our OWN beds," Buffy said putting up a hand. </P>
<P>Willow complied. </P>
<P>"Okay," Buffy said drawing out the word. "Let the talking
begin," she continued slapping her hands together. "Now we shall talk…now…talk,"
she went on. </P>
<P>Willow simply stared at her. Buffy looked back. All of a
sudden she couldn't think of much to talk about. That fact that couldn't think
of anything to talk about was absolutely confounding since they obviously had a
lot to discuss. They were best friends, they were both girls, Buffy was a
Slayer. All of those factors had come into play keeping them apart, but now…no
talk. It was almost like they were beyond words. </P>
<P>They smiled at the same time. Standing up they met each
other half way between the beds and started to kiss each other passionately.
What they were feeling was more than words, and that's what they needed to
explain it. </P>
<P>"Willow?" Buffy asked in between kisses. </P>
<P>"Uh huh," Willow managed to get out before lowering her head
to Buffy neck. </P>
<P>"Do you want this?" Buffy asked. It was important that she
know. </P>
<P>"More than I've ever wanted anything in life," Willow
responded. </P>
<P>"Good," Buffy responded running her hands up Willow's sides
again. "Then take off your clothes." </P>
<P>"After you," Willow responded slipping her hand under
Buffy's shirt.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy carefully lead Willow over to her bed and lay her down
before joining her. Lying down next her Buffy brought her lips to Willow's
kissing her as their hands resumed searching each others bodies, seeking out and
removing clothing. </P>
<P>And then, before they knew it they were both completely
devoid of clothing, and their bodies lay together unobstructed, skin to skin.
Passionately, loving they explored each others bodies, learning and exciting.
Moving together and apart in a dance as old as time itself. No inch of their
bodies, no piece of their skin on either of their bodies was left uncharted,
untouched, unmoved. </P>
<P>That night, two souls, two bodies, two loves became one. And
it was good.</p>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy lay on her side drawing shapes on Willow's stomach
with her finger as her friend, her lover, lay on her back with her eyes closed.
Buffy smiled and leaned over placing a kiss just a above Willow's belly-button.
She felt the surface beneath her ripple and knew that Willow was laughing
gently. </P>
<P>"That tickles," Willow said raising her hand and running it
through Buffy's hair. </P>
<P>"So I probably shouldn't do it again, huh?" Buffy asked
placing another kiss above the red-head's belly-button. </P>
<P>"You're…" Willow started. </P>
<P>"Incorrigible," Buffy asked. "I'm not exactly sure what that
means but people usually say it in situations like this." </P>
<P>"I was going to say 'bad', but incorrigible works too,"
Willow said moving Buffy's head away from her stomach. </P>
<P>Buffy obliged and moved up until she was above Willow
looking down at her. Smiling she leaned down and brought their lips together.
</P>
<P>"Hey, Will?" Buffy asked moving so that she was lying on her
side once again. </P>
<P>"What?" Willow asked lazily. </P>
<P>"If that 'kinda gay' comment was true, does that mean the
dominatrix thing is too?" Buffy asked watching Willow carefully to see her
reaction. </P>
<P>To her surprise Willow hardly reacted at all. She merely
turned her head so that she was looking directly at Buffy and smiled.
</P>
<P>"Who knows," Willow said. "I've long since ceased trying to
predict anything that might happen in my life." </P>
<P>Buffy looked at her for a moment then shook her head. She'd
leave that one alone for the moment. </P>
<P>"You know," Buffy said changing the subject. "It's funny…"
</P>
<P>"What is?" Willow asked playing the palm of Buffy's hand.
</P>
<P>"If I hadn't overheard Claire and some of her buddies
talking in the café, none of this," she said gesturing to their bodies, "might
have happened." </P>
<P>"Claire?" Willow asked surprised. </P>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy said shaking her head. "When I was waiting for
you, I overhead them talking about us. At the end the general consensus seemed
to be that we were, and I quote 'queer as black sunshine', and we were being
queer together," Buffy continued. "It made me start to think…which isn't always
a good thing with me…and I started to realize that maybe they weren't that far
off the mark, at least about my feelings," she finished shaking her head. "Just
goes to show you, life is like…" </P>
<P>"Don't…Buffy, don't," Willow said. She knew where this was
going. </P>
<P>"…a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get,"
Buffy continued smiling as Willow scrunched up her face. </P>
<P>"It's funny that you mention Claire," Willow said a moment
later. </P>
<P>"Why?" Buffy asked running her eyes up and down Willow's
body. She was ready to stop talking again real soon. </P>
<P>"She's the one that got me thinking about it too," Willow
said. "At least seriously," she added. </P>
<P>"Really?" Buffy asked looking up curiously. </P>
<P>"Yeah, that night that I met you down by the stadium I ran
into her-literally-and we walked together for a while. Then just before she
headed in her own direction, she said something about 'it' being great. And I
was all, what's 'it', you know? And she was like 'you and Buffy, there's so much
homophobia, you're so brave' blah, blah," Willow continued. "After that I
started thinking about it, well thinking about it intensely." </P>
<P>"Well, I for one say 'yeh for Claire!'," Buffy responded.
"But let's stop with the talking, and get with the…" Buffy stopped, she couldn't
think of a word. </P>
<P>Willow smiled and leaned over bringing her lips to Buffy's.
</P>
<P>"It's a good thing I'm the brains of this operation," Willow
mumbled before they both lost the ability to speak, but in the best possible
way.</P>
