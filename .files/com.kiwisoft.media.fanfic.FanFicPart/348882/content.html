<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 23 - Doubts-->

<P>"The Delta Flyer," Parker said in shock.</P>
<P>The ship had crashed just outside the perimeter of Parker's botanical garden.
What was before a harsh desert had now become an endless wheat field. The desert
was a big reason why Parker had stayed put in the gardens, now it was gone,
replaced by a wheat field. The Delta Flyer had landed on a circular patch of
dirt, which prevented the wheat from catching on fire. </P>
<P>Small flames burned and flickered, stretching out their fiery tongues through
small holes from the broken wreck. Dropping her weapon, Parker raced passed the
last of her garden and searched for any way to pry open the door of the ship.
Hot to the touch, Parker realized that using her bare hands wasn't a bright
idea. </P>
<P>Parker ran back to get her weapon. When she examined the javelin like branch,
she decided that it was strong enough to pry open the door, so she found an edge
and began to push down, hoping the automatic opening mechanism would start and
she wouldn't have to do all the work. </P>
<P>Whoever was trapped in the burning wreck was probably unconscious by now
judging by the smoke. This urged Parker on as she made one last valiant effort
to open the door and then fell back exhausted as the door opened automatically.
A rush of thick black smoke poured out of the open door and covered the poor
ensign as she held her breath. Backing up and taking several deep breaths,
Parker made a mad rush into the ship looking for any signs of survivors. The
pressure in her head built up as she held her breath, frantically looking for
bodies in the blinding smoke and searing heat.</P>
<P>Finally, Parker was able to make out a prone Captain Janeway lying next to
the console, covered in sweat with a slightly charred tank top and black pants.
Parker strategically let out small breaths of air as she wrapped her arms around
the Captain's body and dragged her out head first. Letting out one final breath
Parker dragged Janeway down the door ramp and onto the dirt ground, safe from
harm.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After several long arguments as to how exactly the basket full of goodies
showed up, and whether or not the food was poisonous, B'Elanna and Seven decided
that it was best to simply let one of them eat, then wait for an hour or two to
see if there were any side effects. Of course both of them volunteered to be the
guinea pig, not wanting their partner to get ill. But in the end, B'Elanna won
the argument, saying that Seven wasn't feeling too well, and that her Klingon
stomach was just plain starving and needed to eat.</P>
<P>Watching like a hawk, Seven's eyes never left B'Elanna's mouth as she took
small bites from both sandwiches. B'Elanna responded by staring back, giving her
the do you mind look. Seven realized her lover's pre-occupation with social
etiquette and not wanting someone gawking at her while she ate. So she moved
behind the hungry half-Klingon and nuzzled her lover in the neck, hearing
everyone sound, feeling every movement as B'Elanna ate. </P>
<P>Seven still wore her towel, her bio-suit along with B'Elanna's jacket and
unmentionables were drying on some rocky ledges in the waning sun. Apparently
B'Elanna didn't mind being hugged and nuzzled against while she ate, but staring
was out of the question. These human nuances often annoyed Seven, but seeing
that now B'Elanna was her lover, they were now extremely humorous.</P>
<P>After several hours of Borg observation, B'Elanna was convinced the food was
alright and decided that Seven should eat the other sandwich which she had so
thoughtfully taken a small bite out of. The young blonde hesitated, wanting
B'Elanna to eat the sandwich.</P>
<P>"You require more nutritional supplements than I do," Seven argued.</P>
<P>"You may be right on that," B'Elanna said while rubbing her belly, "but you
haven't regenerated in a while, and seeing that there aren't any Borg alcoves
around, I'd say you need this more than I do."</P>
<P>B'Elanna reached for the sandwich and held it up to Seven. The young Borg
took the sandwich thankfully and began eating, only now realizing how hungry she
actually was. B'Elanna watched with a laugh as Seven swallowed the last of the
sandwich, barely chewing any of it. </P>
<P>"Did anyone ever tell you it's good to chew your food first?"</P>
<P>Seven surprised B'Elanna with her response.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, actually," Seven answered, not realizing it was a
rhetorical question.<BR><BR>"Oh."<BR><BR>B'Elanna felt a pang of jealousy at
hearing Seven mention the Captain's name. Everyone on the ship knew there was
something special between Janeway and the Borg, but only some people would
actually dare say anything about it behind her back.</P>
<P>B'Elanna recalled the times she had ranted to Tom about Seven getting
preferential treatment because she was the Captain's pet. B'Elanna recalled the
times she felt angry, only now realizing it was jealousy, whenever the Captain
would put a soft hand on Seven's shoulder. B'Elanna recalled the times she
implied, in angry sarcastic tones, that Seven was Janeway's pet whenever she
argued with the young Borg. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven asked the dazed Engineer.</P>
<P>"Huh?" B'Elanna answered, still feeling guilty about all the hurtful memories
she had dredged up.</P>
<P>"You drifted off there, so to speak," Seven answered smoothly, pulling in an
obviously troubled B'Elanna into an embrace.</P>
<P>"Oh nothing, I was just thinking."</P>
<P>"About what?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna flushed at the innocent interrogation, but realized that it was best
to tell the truth; not wanting to start off their relationship with lies.</P>
<P>"To be honest, I was thinking about when we used to fight."<BR><BR>This both
surprised Seven and gave her a stab of fear as well. </P>
<P>"Do you wish to fight?" Seven asked sadly, the painful memories drenching her
body. </P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna said, shocked. "Of course I don't want to fight Seven, I was
just thinking about it that's all. It doesn't mean I want to fight."</P>
<P>B'Elanna pulled Seven in closer, trying to hug Seven's insecurities and fears
away.</P>
<P>Seven responded by hugging back possessively. The fear of fighting with
B'Elanna brought thoughts of losing her, and of Tom. What would happen when they
got back to Voyager? Would she leave her? Would B'Elanna go back to Tom? The
thoughts were too painful, and she simply buried her head into B'Elanna's neck,
hoping that would make them go away.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stroked Seven's silky smooth hair, no longer wet, and began combing
it down gently. The half-Klingon knew Seven was going through an emotional time,
trying to cope with feelings she never knew she had. Or maybe she did know these
feelings. </P>
<P>Janeway once again entered B'Elanna's mind, eating at her and firing her up.
What if Janeway and Seven had already done something together? The thought tore
away at B'Elanna's heart. A kiss. Something more. Everyone knew a kiss could
open the flood gates. But this was the Captain, she would never have a romantic
relationship with a crew member, would she? The fear hollowed out a hole inside
B'Elanna, making her hug Seven tighter for support. But hearing and feeling the
soft murmurs from Seven on her neck, put all doubts aside. </P>
<P>Janeway wasn't in the picture. She never was, and she never will be.</P>
<P>Confident that Seven had chosen her, and only her, B'Elanna enjoyed the
spectacular sunset coloring the horizon and laid back, holding a silent Seven I
her arms. The cold night was coming and B'Elanna knew she'd have to get their
dried clothes soon, but she decided to wait till Seven fell asleep, not wanting
to leave this moment or her true love.</P>
