<p>Olivia was drinking coffee in the collage cafe, she had been in desperate need of caffeine since she had left Viola's place. Caffeine was needed, not for calming but more for spacing out, causing a tranquil, not all together feeling. These mixed emotions, and drugs, that were running through her body were causing her to have all sorts of crazy illusions, like seeing Duke with his arm wrapped around Viola walk into the cafe. As Olivia squinted her eyes, she realized this was not a illusion, the two took a table a couple of seats away from her, neither of them had spotted her, and she was sure they were a little to close to be out for a casual chat.</p>
<p>Duke sat down opposite Viola, holding onto one of her hands to comfort her, as she tried to recall what she was so upset about.</p>
<p>Olivia looked on with horror as Duke stroked Viola's hand, she was about to stand up and march over there when the coffee went straight to her head, 5 cups in a row will do that to you. Olivia fell back down into the lounge and watched as they continued to talk, she couldn't make out what they were saying but from the body language being displayed she was pretty sure she didn't want to.</p>
<p>Duke put out his hand up and wiped away the tear that had crept down Viola's cheek, he hated seeing her like this.</p>
<p>Olivia winced as Duke caressed Viola's cheek, Viola looked up at him and smiled. Olivia felt like dieing, right then and there, she couldn't take the cutesy display on the following table.</p>
<p>Forcing herself to a standing position Olivia payed for her coffee and walked out, but not before stealing a glance at Viola, who smiled at Duke's words. With even more horror Viola watched as Viola pulled Duke into a hug. She hated him, She wanted him gone, and in that instant, in caffeine overload, Olivia worked out exactly what she wanted, Viola.</p>
<p>Storming off down the street she dreaded the next class that was to take place, seeing that perfect mixture of mischief and innocence that was Viola. Then again venting anger, was the name of the next activity, maybe Olivia would get her own back.</p>
<p>Inside the cafe, Viola listened intently as Duke told her what he thought of the situation.</p>
<p>"I mean their obviously falling apart, why not just stay out of it. Wait till the relationship is completely over and then tell Olivia how you feel." said Duke taking a sip of his milkshake, Viola laughed as he pulled away the cup to reveal his new mustache.</p>
<p>"Yeah your probably right, but I mean Sebastian's not even trying anymore", said Viola looking down sadly.</p>
<p>"Then tell her now", said Duke, Viola looked up at him, shocked.</p>
<p>"Well if their already as good as over, why not tell her?", asked Duke, wiping his milk mustache.</p>
<p>"You know what, your right", said Viola looking up, excitedly.</p>
<p>"Whats new?", asked Duke shrugging.</p>
<p>"To new beginnings", said Viola putting her milkshake in the air.</p>
<p>"To new beginnings", mimicked Duke, putting his own milkshake in the air.</p>
<p>"Cheers", they said in unison.</p>
<p>Viola laughed as Duke took a big gulp of his milkshake and burped.</p>
<p>"Your the best", said Viola giving him a hug.</p>
<p>"Thats right", said Duke pointing at Viola. "And your going to get that girl, even if it kills me", he continued laughing.</p>
<p>Viola leaned across the table and hugged him again.</p>
<p>"Gotta go, I need to work out what I'm going to say next class",said Viola jumping up.</p>
<p>"Good luck with that", said Duke as she ran out. "Your gonna need it", he said to no one.</p>
<p>Viola ran back to her dorm room with a new energy, she was excited, excited about the stupid couple therapy class, excited about seeing Olivia and for once being able to say what she had been feeling for over two years. Viola bounced with a new spring in her step, it was love, but was it going to work out.</p>
