<!-- To Challenge the Queen \ Story -->

<p>&quot;May the best Amazon win!&quot; </p>

<p>Within seconds, after the cry of the lone Amazon, giving tribal voice
to the challenge, Gabrielle, Xena, and Eve found themselves flanked on all sides by
inquisitive young Amazons wanting first hand details of events they had been privy to only
through stories handed down from their mothers.</p>

<p>The three new arrivals continued to become further and further
separated from each other as groups of women surrounded each of them individually. Some of
the sisters wanted to talk to the Bard Queen, others found themselves interested in the
Warrior, and a third group of Amazons were curious to hear about Rome or how it felt to be
the daughter of the two very famous women.</p>

<p>Looking out over the crowd surrounding her, Xena tried to keep an eye
on Gabrielle, as she wasn&#146;t sure whether the small blonde would be in danger from
someone who might want to give the reigning Queen an advantage over the challenger. The
warrior smiled when she recognized the golden head bobbing up and down rhythmically and
knew that her bard was probably enthusiastically in the middle of an exciting story.</p>

<p>Xena continued searching and her eyes met Eve&#146;s, the two of them
simultaneously giving each other &#145;the look&#146; with raised eyebrows and crooked
grins, denoting that they were not enjoying their popularity quite as profusely as the
returning Queen.</p>

<p>Tolerating the question and answer period for more than a candlemark,
Xena finally excused herself by asking where the tribe intended for the former Queen and
her family to spend their first night back in the village. </p>

<p>Rhea&#146;s daughter, Toxaris, came forward explaining that she had
sent a group of young women and children over to the hut the three of them had called home
so many years before. She explained that although it now stood on the outskirts of the
village, the older Amazons had insisted that it be kept in perfect condition as a monument
to the Bard Queen.</p>

<p>&quot;We lost many of our elder sisters in the border skirmishes some
eight full seasons ago and then more of them when the sickness hit following contamination
from our enemies. At the time Cyane was still Queen and she, Eris, my mother, and a few
others were adamant that the hut remain intact and that the younger children be given
their storytime there by the bards. </p>

<p>&quot;Queen Gabrielle was a favorite of the elders and those of us who
grew up listening to the stories from mothers who remembered, are thrilled to be able to
get to know the Bard Queen personally. Cyane passed over a while back from the sickness
and Tecmessa took control. Since then there has been much unrest between those of us
trying to follow a more peaceful existence and those wanting to return to the violence of
the past.&quot;</p>

<p>Toxaris offered to walk with the warrior over to the hut to see how the
cleanup was coming along and Xena accepted her invitation. </p>

<p>It was like stepping back in time &#150; not the too distant past for
Xena &#150; but 25 years for any of the villagers old enough to remember. All the
decorations Gabrielle had painstakingly collected or made during their short stay in the
village were hung in the exact same manner as the bard had hung them. Their separate beds
were still tied together. She smiled when the memory of that little accomplishment flashed
across her mind, and she made a mental note to find the tribe&#146;s wood craftswoman as
soon as possible. Even with an abundance of furs and feathers, the separation between the
beds was still quite uncomfortable, especially during intimate moments. The bed Aphrodite
had supplied them at the grotto had now become her measure of decadent comfort and she
wanted the same for them here, if this was to be their home for a while.</p>

<p>&quot;Look Xena,&quot; the young Amazon broke the warrior&#146;s
concentration on the sleeping arrangements. &quot;Queen Gabrielle&#146;s mask &#150; the
feathers have been refreshed whenever they seemed to be drooping so it should look just as
it did the last time she wore it. It&#146;s beautiful isn&#146;t it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Toxaris, it is. I&#146;m sure Gabrielle will be thrilled that
everything has remained in such excellent condition. This hut is an honor to her and I
know she will appreciate the effort the entire village has made.&quot; She walked over to
the young Amazon and put a strong arm around her shoulders. &quot;We&#146;ll have to make
arrangements to thank your mother and Eris for continuing this tradition, even after
Tecmessa began her reign.</p>

<p>The desired effect was received when Toxaris looked up into the famous
warrior&#146;s face. Pride was overflowing in the younger woman&#146;s dark brown eyes.
&quot;Thank you Xena. I know Mother would be thrilled at the thought of the Queen
appreciating her small gesture.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When we were here last, Eve was just a baby.&quot; Xena murmured
as she stared at the small crib. &quot;Is there a spare bed we can put in here until she
gets a hut of her own?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All of us who share one of the long huts have already talked
about that, and we would like to invite the Princess . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute, I wouldn&#146;t go addressing Eve as
Princess,&quot; Xena interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;But we have been taught that she is next in line for the throne
if something were to happen to Queen Gabrielle,&quot; Toxaris debated with the warrior.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, but I think you will find that both Gabrielle and Eve
prefer to be addressed informally unless it is a tribal occasion. So . . . Eve will do
just fine, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Xena.&quot; Toxaris agreed as she continued. &quot;We would
like . . . Eve . . . to stay with us for a while, until things are settled. That way you
and the Queen will have your privacy. Then if . . . Eve . . . wants a private hut, there
are those of us who would be happy to help her build it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s very generous of you and your friends. I&#146;m sure
Eve will be honored.&quot; In her own mind Xena breathed a sigh of relief. It was one
thing being up in the grotto with Eve below knowing what was happening at night and quite
another to be in the same room with her. She hadn&#146;t been looking forward to too many
nights of being a happy trio, and Toxaris had just alleviated that concern.</p>

<p>&quot;It looks like everything is just about ready for occupancy. What
do you say we go find Gabrielle and Eve?&quot; </p>

<p>They turned to walk out the door when one of the younger sisters
accidentally dropped one of Gabrielle&#146;s old scrolls. Toxaris turned suddenly and
darted across the room toward the young girl. &quot;Don&#146;t be so clumsy! Don&#146;t
you realize how precious these scrolls are?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa, Toxaris,&quot; Xena exclaimed, putting herself between the
angry Amazon and the now frightened child. &quot;I understand you wanting her to show
respect, but Toxaris, these are just . . .&quot;</p>

<p>It took an act of fearlessness to speak back to the infamous Xena, but
when it came to the Bard Queen&#146;s scrolls &#150; they were considered sacred
artifacts. The children were not supposed to touch them under any circumstances and only
the older Amazons were given the privilege of gently cleaning the dust from the
irreplaceable stories. </p>

<p>&quot;You don&#146;t understand, warrior. These scrolls are precious to
the village &#150; they cannot be replaced and must be revered.&quot;</p>

<p>A small smiled graced the face of the older woman as she thought about
how important Gabrielle was to this small village. They were desperately trying to hold on
to old customs, while the world around them was changing at an ever-increasing pace.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m sorry. I do understand Toxaris, but Gabrielle is not a
Goddess, her scrolls are stories, elaborations of truths . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe to you, Xena, after all you live with the Queen. But to us
they are more than that. These scrolls have brought smiles and tears to the eyes of
children and adults alike for 25 years. The life lessons written in the lines of these
scrolls, as well as the adventures have kept many in this tribe from leaving and finding a
different way.&quot;</p>

<p>The more the young Amazon talked the more Xena realized how much
Gabrielle had influenced the young women of the tribe when they brought Eve here to be
christened 25 years ago. Her message of uniting the Amazons and teaching them to live
peacefully had touched the hearts of many of the women at that time and still carried
through to their daughters. But they had put her onto a pedestal that Xena hoped she would
be able to live up to.</p>

<p>Realizing that she was not going to dissuade the young Amazon even an
centimeter, she closed the discussion by patting the younger child on the head and telling
her she was finished helping and could go outside and play. The girl, who stood there
watching with eager eyes as the two women discussed the Bard Queen, had touched a tender
area in the warrior&#146;s heart. </p>

<p>This hut brought back loving memories and hopes of what could have
been, along with the stark reality of what actually came to pass. She shook off the
unsettling feeling and turned back to Toxaris. &quot;Come on young Amazon, let&#146;s go
find your Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>Dusk was beginning to cover the village in a mist of light fog and the
warrior&#146;s stomach was starting to complain about a lack of food when they spotted the
Queen and her entourage headed toward the hut.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena the festivities are going to start any time now,&quot;
Gabrielle informed her mate. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Checking on tonight&#146;s lodging, my Queen,&quot; Xena threw a
sarcastic look in the direction of the Queen&#146;s quarters. &quot;I&#146;m sure
you&#146;ll need to rest sometime tonight, after all you do have a Challenge in the
morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know Xena,&quot; Gabrielle acknowledged, breaking away from the
crowd and joining her lover on the porch. As she stepped through the doorway and glanced
around the hut, tears formed in the sea-green eyes. When she turned, her warrior received
a melancholy smile, she knew only too well. </p>

<p>&quot;By the Gods, Xena, look at this place! It&#146;s exactly the way
we left it 25 years ago! I would have never expected . . .&quot; The bard choked and was
temporarily at a loss for words as pictures of the past danced before her eyes. Memories
of talks, walks, rituals, and of Xena reading her scrolls for the first time, filled the
bard&#146;s mind and her soul wept for the loss of what could have been.</p>

<p>Xena waved the crowd away as she turned to walk back into the hut and
take her world into her arms.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, Gabrielle. I feel the same way. We have to put that
behind us and go on from here. Those memories will always remain and as bittersweet as
they are, we should be content that we were able to enjoy Eve, if only for a little
while.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle turned and threw her arms around her warrior&#146;s waist,
burying her face in the bosom of her heart. &quot;I don&#146;t know what I would do if I
ever lost you, Xena. Where could I go where my heart would not break?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You won&#146;t lose me, Gabrielle. I&#146;ll be here for a very
long time.&quot; The warrior ran her fingers through soft golden hair as she comforted her
lover. &quot;Look at this.&quot; She picked up one of the scrolls. &quot;You are
remembered as Goddess here, my love. The children are not even allowed to touch your
sacred scrolls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sacred?&quot; A look of astonishment crossed the fair face.
&quot;Did you say sacred?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This hut has been kept like a shrine for 25 years. You must have
said something of great importance while we were here.&quot; The warrior smiled broadly,
appreciative that the tears in her lover&#146;s eyes were drying. &quot;Do you remember
what it was?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably never marry a warrior!&quot; Gabrielle grinned.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? Is that what you would have told these women?&quot; She
pulled Gabrielle close and kissed her head. &quot;You didn&#146;t forget one of the
reasons we&#146;re here &#150; now did you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not. How could I forget that one of my most longed for
wishes was finally being granted?&quot;</p>

<p>Xena placed a strong hand under the smaller woman&#146;s chin and
tilted the gentle face toward her own. &quot;I love you more than life; you know that
don&#146;t you?&quot; It was a question that needed no answer. The verbal thought was
accented with a passionate kiss, and the moment would have continued to linger save for
the entrance of their daughter and a small band of her followers.</p>

<p>&quot;Eve,&quot; Xena growled. &quot;Next time announce your arrival .
. . stomp on the steps or something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Mother.&quot; Eve nonchalantly walked over to the baby bed
in the corner of the hut. &quot;Was this mine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Gabrielle answered. &quot;It was a gift from the Queen
Regent, Cyane. You were a very popular little girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, this is how an Amazon Queen . . . and her consort,&quot; Eve
smiled over at her mother, &quot;live?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Most definitely.&quot; Gabrielle looked in the direction of their
daughter and then up on the wall. &quot;That was . . . is . . . my ceremonial mask and my
staff . . .&quot; She continued to look around the room. Addressing the congregation on
the porch Gabrielle asked, &quot;Do any of you know what was done with the staff I used
the last time I was here in the village? The one I used to give lessons?&quot; </p>

<p>One of the braver of the young women ventured forward. She stuttered
slightly, trying to explain the missing article. &quot;Queen Gabrielle . . .&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Just Gabrielle will do . . . what&#146;s your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marpesia,&quot; the Amazon informed her Queen before continuing.
&quot;Okay . . . ah . . . Gabrielle . . .&quot; It was obvious the woman was having a
difficult time addressing her Queen by her first name. &quot; . . . The staff has been
used as a token of esteem. There is a competition among the young adult warriors once each
season, such as Winter Solstice, Summer Solstice, etc. Whoever is the overall winner that
day is allowed to take the staff home and care for it for the rest of the season.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see,&quot; Gabrielle lied.</p>

<p>Another of the young women stepped forward and spoke up. &quot;We also
have contests for the young bards of the village, Que . . . um . . . Gabrielle. They get
to keep your quill. It&#146;s a great inspiration.&quot; She blushed and bowed back into
the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, those are interesting facts.&quot; Gabrielle shook her head
up and down with a still somewhat puzzled look on her face. &quot;I guess I have some new
traditions to get used to.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena saw that Gabrielle was at an unusual loss for words and
intervened. &quot;Are any of you supposed to be helping with the dinner, dance, or music
preparations?&quot;</p>

<p>A knowing look and smile graced the warrior&#146;s face as more than
half of the young women turned and raced toward the center of the village. Another brave
soul stuck her head in and invited Eve to join them in the preparations.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t think I&#146;m needed around here. That might be
fun.&quot; She told her parents she would meet them at dinner and left to join the
remainder of the crowd as they exited the porch.</p>

<p>&quot;So Xena, do you think we walked into a Bacchae&#146;s nest
here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no . . . nothing we won&#146;t be able to handle. Give them
one full moon and you&#146;ll be just one of the girls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#146;t know if I want to go that far, my love. Simply not
having to correct them for calling me Queen all the time will be good enough. A little
special attention never hurts.&quot; She winked up at her lover. &quot;Hey, when we get to
communal hut will you remind me to ask one of the girls exactly who is in possession of my
staff?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? There&#146;s an entire weapons room full of them.&quot; Xena
arched an eyebrow as she watched her mate searching the room with her eyes, hoping for the
staff to miraculously appear. The warrior knew full well the sentimental value that
Gabrielle put on her staffs, especially since her very first weapon was no longer
available to her.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to feel it in my hands again.&quot; She smiled at the
warrior. &quot;It had the same balance as the one Ephiny gave me. Now, memories are all I
have of her, aside from . . .&quot; She walked over and opened one of the saddlebags that
had been taken off the horses. A look of sorrow crossed the fair face and her voice became
almost a whisper. &quot; . . . aside from this.&quot; She caressed the small bird&#146;s
head ornament that had decorated the top of her initiation staff. Xena.&quot; Gabrielle
looked into her lover&#146;s eyes. &quot;Do you think we could find out where Xenan is?
When we start looking up family, I want to find him and see what he&#146;s done with his
life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, Gabrielle. I wouldn&#146;t mind seeing the little prince .
. . I need to stop thinking like that though; he&#146;s certainly not a &#145;little
prince&#146; any longer now is he?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I&#146;m sure not!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle you are going to get some practice in before morning,
right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right! I was going to ask you if you would spar with me? You
would be more of a challenge than most of the warriors here and I definitely feel in need
of a strong sparring partner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think Queenie is going to give you a problem?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really, but I want to look my best and it has been a while
since I wielded a staff.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but it&#146;s like riding a horse. Once you learn, you never
forget. From the look on Tecmessa&#146;s face the staff is not her weapon of choice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh well! Queen Tecmessa is quite the feisty one isn&#146;t
she?&quot; Gabrielle stood tall, throwing her shoulders back in imitation of the reigning
Queen. Clearing her throat loudly she continued, &#145;Descendent from that Tecmessa who
died at the hands of Hercules.&quot; The sarcasm was quite apparent.</p>

<p>&quot;A little catty today are we, my bard, my Queen?&quot; Xena
answered with a slight snicker in her tone.</p>

<p>&quot;By the Gods, Xena, didn&#146;t you hear her snide remarks,
&#145;claim your Queenhood on a whim?&#146; On a whim indeed! Just because she has royal
Amazon blood coursing through her veins she thinks she&#146;s so . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Calm down, Gabrielle, she offered you a challenge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She almost blatantly called me a fairytale!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps she meant legend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you taking up for Her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m not Gabrielle. It&#146;s just that getting yourself all
worked up like this before the challenge can do nothing but interfere with you
concentration,&quot; Xena replied trying to reason with her bard.</p>

<p>&quot;I disagree,&quot; Gabrielle continued. &quot;It only makes me
more determined to win.&quot;</p>

<p>With a deep sigh the warrior placed two strong hands on her bard&#146;s
shoulders. &quot;Tonight we practice, and tomorrow you&#146;ll again take your rightful
place as Queen. But now . . . &quot; a gurgling sound was audible from the region of the
warrior&#146;s stomach. &quot;Now we need to eat! If I&#146;m sounding like this,&quot;
she pointed to the offending area of her anatomy, &quot;I know sure as Tartarus you must
be starving.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s been such a busy afternoon and I almost could say I
forgot about being hungry.&quot; She smiled into her warrior&#146;s sparkling blue eyes.
&quot;You&#146;ll notice I said, Almost! Come on, let&#146;s go see what these Amazons are
cooking up.&quot;</p>

<p>Arm in arm the warrior and bard left the Bard Queen&#146;s Residence
and headed for the communal lodge where most of the village feasts were held. Gabrielle
and Xena had been given a seat of honor at one end of the table and Queen Tecmessa was
seated at the other end. There were various other tables scattered around the room and the
younger Amazons, who had a kind of catch-as-catch-can meal, were in charge of making sure
the tables remained full of food and beverages.</p>

<p>Xena filled her goblet with wine, but when Gabrielle held hers out for
the same, Xena instructed the young maid to get the pitcher of berry juice for the Queen.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Narrowed verdant eyes glared at her
warrior. &quot;I&#146;m thirsty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you are, but wine is not on your agenda this
evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One goblet of wine would not hurt me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I beg to differ with you. You haven&#146;t had the fruit of the
vine in quite a while, and you have a challenge in the morning. The last thing you need is
to be hung over.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena,&quot; Gabrielle whined as the young woman returned with a
pitcher of berry juice and filled her goblet. &quot;Thank you,&quot; the bard tersely
dismissed the server with a nod.</p>

<p>&quot;This is so unfair!&quot; The bard continued to complain.</p>

<p>&quot;The fair is in Amphipolis, Gabrielle.&quot; Xena tried to make
light of the situation. Getting no response she shook her head and offered her goblet to
the pouting bard. &quot;That&#146;s very Queenly of you, my love. Here, one sip won&#146;t
hurt you.&quot;</p>

<p>Grabbing the goblet without so much as a by your leave, the fair-haired
woman took several gulps before her warrior realized what she was doing.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you satisfied?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite!&quot; Gabrielle replied, as she tore into the leg of
rabbit on her plate, ignoring the stare she was receiving from her mate. &quot;Looks like
Eve&#146;s fish are a big success.&quot; She pointed to the end of the table; a large
platter of fillets was quickly emptying as the hungry Amazons filled their plates.</p>

<p>Ignoring the fish statement, Xena started in on her own plate.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#146;s the matter with you?&quot; Gabrielle took the
warrior&#146;s elbow when she didn&#146;t turn to face her.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m only looking out for your welfare Gabrielle. Sometimes,
I still do know what&#146;s best. I know I said we&#146;re equals, but . . . I want you at
your very best in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle&#146;s tone softened when she spoke again. &quot;I&#146;m
sorry. It seemed like you were treating me like a child. Listen those few mouthfuls will
be out of my system in a couple candlemarks. No more tonight, even though this is supposed
to be a welcome home celebration. Okay? Truce?&quot; The green in her eyes had softened
and the smile was irresistible to her warrior.</p>

<p>&quot;You know I can&#146;t stay angry with you when you look at me
like that.&quot; She bent and kissed Gabrielle tenderly on the cheek. &quot;I just
don&#146;t want you to get hurt tomorrow. Are you sure you won&#146;t reconsider and let
me be your champion?&quot;</p>

<p>Doing her best to keep the irritation out of her voice, Gabrielle
slowly shook her head. &quot;Listen, my love, I thought we had been all through this? If I
am to be Queen the warriors need to know that I will be an asset to the ranks. I
don&#146;t want to be a Queen in name only, Xena. I&#146;m no longer a child.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that Gabrielle.&quot; There was a pleading quality to the
warrior&#146;s tone. &quot;It&#146;s only . . .&quot;</p>

<p>The blonde placed two small fingers on her lover&#146;s lips, a
shushing sound emanating from her own. &quot;Tecmessa&#146;s not a Goddess, not an
Immortal, and probably not even a good staff-woman. But she is the Queen, and I am the one
who needs to put her in her place.&quot; She reached up and whispered softly. &quot;I love
that you want to protect me and I need to know that you feel that way, but trust me, my
love &#150; I&#146;ll be fine.&quot; She kissed her warrior and motioned that they
continue eating.</p>

<p>Following the meal, the reigning Queen led the crowd out to the bonfire
where dancers and musicians awaited their audience. After a brief period of entertainment
everyone was invited to join in the dancing and singing. </p>

<p>At first Eve sat in awe of the liquid movements of the dancers, but
soon she was coaxed into joining in the festivities.</p>

<p>A fierce looking young warrior approached the duo as they sat enjoying
the entertainment. Xena was taken back at first by the somber look on the young
woman&#146;s face. </p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me Queen Gabrielle . . .&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle did not flinch this time as it was at least a semi-formal
occasion and use of the royal title was well within propriety. She acknowledged the woman
standing before her and was quite surprised and pleased when her old staff was placed
respectfully into her hands.</p>

<p>&quot;I won the honor of sheltering the staff for the remainder of this
season, my Queen. Now that you are back, I do believe it belongs to you.&quot; The young
sister bowed slightly and began to back away.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My Queen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Phillippis, my Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Phillippis, do you live up to your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That I do my Queen. I have a great love of horses.&quot; The
solemn look had been replaced with a beautiful smile from the tall blonde standing before
Gabrielle. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m glad to hear that Phillippis. Since you must have
competed strongly to have won this trophy for the season, it&#146;s only right that after
the challenge in the morning, it should return to your hut until the next
competition.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, my Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked sternly into the young woman&#146;s face for
attempting to argue with her, but her expression changed as she glanced quizzically at the
staff she now held in her hands. Stepping closer to the fire she examined the staff more
closely. There was a desperate tone to her next question, and it came out harsher than
Gabrielle had expected.</p>

<p>&quot;Phillippis, where exactly did this staff come from?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My Queen, I already told you, I . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; There was a panic in Gabrielle&#146;s voice that caused
Xena to get closer to her bard and the young Amazon.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there a problem, Gabrielle?&quot; Xena asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena, look at this staff she handed me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, what could be wrong with . . . &quot; Xena took the staff
into her hands and ran her fingers along the well-defined symbols. Her eyes got big and
her mouth dropped open as she looked up at Gabrielle. &quot;No, Gabrielle. This is simply
not possible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Xena, I believe it is. Remember our discussion in India
about how all rivers lead to the sea? It seems that this small object, this piece of my
past, has made its way full circle! By the God&#146;s Xena, it is my old staff! It&#146;s
my lost treasure!&quot; Tears of joy flowed freely from unashamed eyes as she took the
staff back and held it to her chest. &quot;Never again, will I part with this, never
again.&quot; </p>

<p>Suddenly remembering there was a third party in on the entire
conversation, Gabrielle turned to the amazed young warrior. Clearing her throat, she
continued her conversation with the woman. </p>

<p>She was now unsure that she wanted to trust her prized possession to
the Amazon standing in front of her but realized that they had kept the staff safe all
these years. It would, most likely, survive a few moons in the young warrior&#146;s hut. </p>

<p>&quot;I expect to be able to visit the staff if I so chose or have it
brought to me if I so desire, but it is to remain with you until the end of this season.
After that, we might find another more suitable object to be awarded as a prize, one
perhaps that need not be returned with the changing of the seasons.</p>

<p>Quite perplexed with the casual and then dramatic conversation from the
Queen, the woman bowed and backed away, then turned to join her friends. Gabrielle could
see her chattering gaily to the women who came running up to find out what the Queen had
to say to a mere warrior. </p>

<p>Gabrielle looked around, searching for Eris. She had to know how they
had come into possession of the staff she was holding tightly to her. &quot;Xena do you
see Eris? We need to talk to her.&quot;</p>

<p>The advantage of height allowed the warrior to better distinguish one
Amazon from another, and she soon spotted the older woman chatting with a group of
dancers.</p>

<p>&quot;There she is, Gabrielle. Come on.&quot; </p>

<p>Excusing themselves and Eris from the conversation they took the woman
aside.</p>

<p>&quot;Eris,&quot; Gabrielle showed her the staff. &quot;This is not the
staff I used when we were in the village last. Where did this one come from and why was it
passed off as my old one?&quot;</p>

<p>Eris bowed her head and began to apologize, &quot;I&#146;m sorry my
Queen . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle,&quot; Gabrielle corrected.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m sorry Gabrielle the staff you had used was destroyed
when the hut of a champion caught on fire, while she was in possession of it. We
didn&#146;t know what we were going to do about keeping up the tradition. But, the day
after the fire one of the women was fishing in the river when this staff floated onto the
shore. She picked it up and noticed that it had similar markings to the one you had used.
It was definitely an Amazonian staff and we claimed it as a sign from the Artemis.
I&#146;m sorry . . . &quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle began to chuckle as she interrupted the unnecessary apology.
&quot;No, Eris. You have no need to be sorry. None whatsoever. Whereas the staff you had
been using had been one of my lessons staffs. This staff . . .&quot; She held up the
cherished object. &quot;This was actually the very first weapon I ever used. I don&#146;t
know how and I don&#146;t know why but fate was kind enough to allow it to be joined with
me again after all these years.&quot; She leaned over and gave the astonished woman a kiss
on the cheek. &quot;Thank you, my old friend, thank you more than I can say for keeping my
treasure safe all these years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My pleasure, Gabrielle.&quot; The woman was smiling from
ear-to-ear as she excused herself to join her friends and tell them the news.</p>

<p>Gabrielle turned to Xena and nodded. &quot;Ah, this is turning out to
be quite a day, Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That it has Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go get a couple practice staffs for our workout to see
if I still have the touch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could stay here and watch the dancers, while you went and
picked a couple out.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle stood and grabbed Xena by the ear, &quot;I definitely think
Not. Come with me warrior, we have sparring to do.&quot;</p>

<p>They nodded good evening to Tecmessa, the dancers, and the musicians;
Xena caught Eve&#146;s eye and mouthed goodnight. Leaving the gaiety of the festivities
behind them the duo walked over to the weapons hut. On the way there Xena suggested that
Gabrielle use her original staff for both the practice and the challenge. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t know if I should do that Xena. I would be devastated
if the staff were broken after all these years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle perhaps the reason it was found to begin with was for
this very challenge. The staff has a history with you and with Ephiny. It was special to
her, and it was special to you. This is a great combat for you, and the destiny of all
Amazons will be affected by the outcome of this confrontation.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;So . . . you think I should use it tomorrow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Definitely.&quot;</p>

<p>The small blonde pondered the situation and agreed with her warrior.
She would be a fool not to consider the staff showing up in Greece as a sign from The
Fates. All rivers may flow to the sea but this staff . . . ending up back here . . . at
this very village . . . all the way from India . . . was nothing short of a miracle. It
had to be destiny. Yes, she decided, she would use the staff as an instrument to help her
regain her throne.</p>

<p>With her decision made, they found a staff for Xena and proceeded on to
the sparring grounds.</p>

<p>Torches surrounded the practice area, and the women sparred for close
to a candlemark. Her bangs were soaked with sweat and Xena had to admit that Gabrielle
gave her a good workout. &quot;What do you say we call it an evening, Gabrielle? Tomorrow
is going to come much faster than you can imagine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, had enough, have you Xena?&quot; The bard smiled, moonlight
glistening on the sweat pouring from her brow, also.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I haven&#146;t &#145;had enough&#146;! I just think you ought
to stop and conserve your energy for tomorrow.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you say to a quick dip in the lake before retiring, I
don&#146;t feel like getting into a clean bed with stinky skin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As long as we don&#146;t have company. I don&#146;t feel like
communal bathing tonight.&quot; Xena put her arm around Gabrielle&#146;s shoulders and
they walked up to the hut to put the staffs away and get a couple of soft cloths for
drying.</p>

<p>It was only a short walk from the hut to the lake; the moon was fairly
full and the path was well lit. Aside from the occasional musical note as it floated on
the breeze, the forest was still. A lone owl hooted as they passed her tree and flew off
in search of food. </p>

<p>&quot;Normally I would have thought of Athena when we spotted that
owl,&quot; Gabrielle admitted. &quot;Our world has changed yet once again.&quot; Putting
her arm around her warrior&#146;s waist they continued walking toward the cooling water.</p>

<p>&quot;It certainly has, Gabrielle. It will take me some time to erase
the look of surprise on the Goddess&#146; face when the sword pierced her skin and she
actually bled. I always admired Athena; it was a bitter victory that&#146;s for
sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn&#146;t it be wonderful, Xena if Aphrodite put another
ledge behind the waterfall on this lake? Just think we could go from here to anywhere we
wanted and . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle! Be thankful for small favors. The grotto is only a day
away. A lot of energy will be conserved with the help of that one small forest.&quot; She
smiled down at her love, held her a little closer and kissed her gently on the head.</p>

<p>&quot;Last one in has to rub the other person&#146;s back until they go
to sleep,&quot; Xena yelled as she threw down her cloth and rushed toward the water.</p>

<p>&quot;No fair, Xena. You always win foot races.&quot;</p>

<p>Long muscular legs slowed their speed and the warrior to whom they
belonged turned around to watch her soon-to-be bride speed up.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ha!&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed as her feet hit the water
seconds before her warrior&#146;s. &quot;Guess I get the back rub tonight!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle you know I stopped and let you beat me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doesn&#146;t matter I got to the water first.&quot; She giggled
and dove under swimming out just far enough to be totally covered when she stood.
&quot;This feels good.&quot;</p>

<p>Before swimming up to stand beside her bard the dark-haired champion
stood near the edge of the lake watching as the moon and stars performed their magic on
the surrounding region. The small area of lake where her golden headed charmer stood
became center stage. Glistening bubbles danced around her body, while stars played
hide-and-seek in the ripples of the cool water. </p>

<p>The warrior&#146;s heart was filled with the picture before her; yet a
deep nagging pain distorted the view. She worried about the contest her heart would be
enduring tomorrow morning when Gabrielle took up the staff against Tecmessa. All reasoning
aside, she still did not like the idea of Gabrielle being voluntarily put in harm&#146;s
way. By the code of warriors she knew Gabrielle was right, but on the other hand She was
the Champion and should be allowed to fight for her. Of what use was she in this village
if she couldn&#146;t even protect the person she loved most in the entire world?</p>

<p>&quot;You going to stand there in all your naked glory until the
Amazons get drunk enough to come join us?&quot; Gabrielle yelled.</p>

<p>Breaking her train of thought the warrior shook her head and dove into
the cool liquid, swimming out to meet her mate. While Gabrielle was covered with water up
to her breasts, her raven-haired companion definitely was not. </p>

<p>&quot;Here, let me wash you,&quot; Gabrielle offered, starting to
lather her lover&#146;s chest.</p>

<p>&quot;If you want to get some sleep tonight and be rested in the
morning, I would suggest that you wash yourself and I wash myself,&quot; Xena lightly
reprimanded as she removed a small hand from an already responding nipple.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you realize that you are absolutely no fun tonight?&quot; The
bard questioned.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you realize that you have a challenge in the morning?&quot;
Xena answered the question with one of her own.</p>

<p>Pouting enough to receive a small kiss, the bard agreed that it would
probably not be a good idea to pursue her heart&#146;s intentions this evening.</p>

<p>&quot;I promise to make tonight up to you when you are reinstated as
Queen, Gabrielle.&quot; Xena closed the distance between them and took her bard into her
arms. &quot;It&#146;s not from lack of desire that I think we should abstain tonight; you
do realize that, don&#146;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my love.&quot; The answer softly drifted up from the area of
the taller woman&#146;s chest. &quot;It&#146;s just that you&#146;re so beautiful in the
moonlight with the stars dancing in your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let&#146;s finish here and get to bed before we let our bodies
rule our minds. I don&#146;t want to jeopardize your abilities, my destiny. Your defenses
must be at peak performance in the morning.&quot; </p>

<p>Bathing returned to mundane as warrior and bard did their best to
ignore the magnetism charging between them. &quot;Not much fun, bathing like this,&quot;
Gabrielle mumbled turning her back on Xena.</p>

<p>Keen ears, of course, picked up the comment and their owner&#146;s
mouth could not keep quiet. &quot;You&#146;ll thank me for this in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are totally out of control do you realize that?&quot; The
warrior was finished bathing, as was the bard. Strong arms reached out and spun the small
blonde around then picked her up pulling her close. Gabrielle&#146;s arms flew around
Xena&#146;s neck as she kissed her warrior without restraint. </p>

<p>&quot;I need to have you so close I can&#146;t tell where your body
leaves off and mine begins,&quot; the bard whimpered. &quot;I need to touch you to keep
myself grounded in the present.&quot; Sea-green eyes began to mist over and tears began to
add themselves to the waters of the lake. </p>

<p>A soft whisper escaped the bard&#146;s lips. So hushed was it that it
would have gone unheard by any other ears, save those of the warrior, but Xena caught the
timid confession of doubt.</p>

<p>&quot;I must admit I don&#146;t relish the fight tomorrow,&quot;
Gabrielle barely breathed.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, my love,&quot; Xena whispered back, letting her life-mate
know she had been heard. &quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&#146;t think I would ever have to fight one of my own. It
seems so . . . so . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uncivilized?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena had walked with her lover in her arms to the edge of the lake and
now gently put her precious bundle down on the soft dirt. &quot;But it&#146;s custom,
Gabrielle. They have to be able to cling to something in these times of change.
Unfortunately you, as their Queen, must allow them to retain some of their traditions to
keep the tribe intact.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. I think I just needed to verbalize the thought.&quot;</p>

<p>Wrapped in the soft drying cloths, they picked up their clothes and
walked back to the hut in silence. </p>

<p>As soon as they entered the hut Gabrielle went to the table and picked
up the bird&#146;s head. With loving hands she placed it back on the staff, which had for
so long been without its adornment. Her eyes filled with tears as she looked upon the
exquisite weapon. It was if it had been naked for too many seasons and now was once again
fully clothed in all its splendor. Memories of Ephiny and her first meeting with the
Amazons flowed freely through her mind and suddenly she was sobbing uncontrollably. </p>

<p>Two strong arms encased her like a protective shell. &quot;There,
there, my sweet, everything is going to be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, Xena,&quot; the bard whimpered. &quot;But look at
this.&quot; She held out the staff. &quot;It makes me miss Ephiny so.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena turned her beloved around and wiped a trail of tears from the fair
face. &quot;Listen to me, Gabrielle. Tomorrow when you go to the challenge, dedicate it to
Ephiny and the Amazons of the past. Dedicate your victory to your friends without whom you
would not be the person you are today. They can live on in you, Gabrielle, and in me, and
in the rest of the Amazon Nation.&quot; She kissed her reason to live and walked her over
to the bed.</p>

<p>Silence ensued as they crawled into bed next to one another. Xena lay
on her back staring at the ceiling when she felt her bard cuddle close, placing an arm
around her warrior&#146;s waist as she laid, her still moist golden tresses on her
champion&#146;s chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever happens tomorrow, know that I love you Xena.&quot;
Gabrielle murmured into the darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything&#146;s going to be just fine, my world; I have faith
in you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just in case something goes wr . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing will, Gabrielle.&quot; The champion&#146;s heart pounded
at the thought of anything going wrong. She could keep the burning question in her heart
no longer. She needed to ask just one more time and hoped that it would not start an
argument. &quot;Gabrielle are you sure you don&#146;t want me to take up the challenge?
It&#146;s not too late you know.&quot;</p>

<p>The dark-haired beauty relaxed ever so slightly as she felt a smile
form on her lover&#146;s face. &quot;No, my love, thank you for offering again, but I
really must do this for myself.&quot; She squeezed tighter and planted a small kiss on her
warrior&#146;s breast.</p>

<p><i>Okay here it goes . . . if I don&#146;t ask now, I&#146;ll never have
the strength to breach the subject, and our living here will never be viable.</i> &quot;If
I can&#146;t be your champion, Gabrielle, what exactly will be my position here in the
village, in the tribe?&quot; <i>There! Your ego is out on the table warrior, here&#146;s
hoping the answer is one we can both live with.</i></p>

<p>Gabrielle repositioned herself on one elbow, her soft green eyes
staring tenderly down into the sapphire orbs that could melt her heart with a single
glance. <i>How could I have been so selfish, so full of myself not to think of how she
must feel?</i> As quickly as possible she gathered her thoughts, now was the time when her
bardly instinct needed to be as sharply honed as possible. <i>One slip of the tongue and
you could devastate her, Gabrielle. If you do that then living here will never be viable.</i></p>


<p>&quot;Xena, that is such an important question but one I had hoped you
would have already known the answer to. For any other challenge, I would not have
hesitated to use you as my champion. For any challenge in the future I will do the same.
You&#146;re my source of strength; I would be lost without your support. Yet, this one
instance is so different, my love, I would think you would realize that, and if you were
thinking logically, I am sure you would have. But you are using your heart here and not
your mind, which is so unlike you, my warrior. I need to gain back the respect of those
who have followed Tecmessa for so long &#150; I know you realize that. If I used you now,
you would win, and I would be Queen. But, I would only have the respect of those who
already respect me. If I do this myself, I show that I am a worthy adversary and that I
deserve to be Queen of the Amazons.&quot; Her furrowed brow showed deep concern for her
warrior&#146;s state of mind and heart. </p>

<p>Xena looked deep within and smiled. <i>All the answers, you gave all
the right answers as I knew you would, my life. </i>The warrior smiled back up at the
other half of her soul. &quot;You&#146;re right, Gabrielle. I was being selfish and a bit
egotistical. I know I belong here as your Consort and your Champion. I think not being
able to show my love and loyalty for this challenge I . . . well I . . . I &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You needed to be reassured, my strong silent warrior,&quot;
Gabrielle smiled and kissed the stuttering lips. &quot;Be assured, my love, you are always
needed by me.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena pulled her bard close and kissed her sweetly, pouring all the love
in her heart into a singular display of affection. Forgetting her own strength she held
Gabrielle so tight that a gasp escaped from her lover&#146;s lips. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m sorry,&quot; she whispered. I was just trying to fulfil
the wish you voiced at the lake.</p>

<p>Gabrielle giggled. &quot;Silly warrior, I want us to be close, but I
also need to breathe. I love you Xena, I&#146;ll see you in my dreams.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, too, Gabrielle, may they be all you desire.&quot;</p>

<p>Sleep came quickly to the contented duo as they continued in dreams
what they had barely avoided consummating in reality on this eve of the challenge. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">********************</p>

<p>The crowing of the cock jolted the warrior from her sleep. It took her
a second to realize where she was, but after she did she kissed the crown of her sleeping
beauty before gently rocking the bard awake.</p>

<p>&quot;Rise and shine, Gabrielle,&quot; Xena insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll rise, but shine &#150; I don&#146;t think so.&quot; The
reply was not an uncommon one.</p>

<p>The reality of the moment hit within seconds and the small blonde
jumped up from her reclining position. &quot;By the Gods, Xena, it&#146;s today
already.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That it is, my love, that it is.&quot; Xena smiled as she rolled
from the bed and began dressing.</p>

<p>&quot;So, how are you feeling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine . . . fine . . . considering.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good &#150; then it&#146;s a good day to take back your
tribe.&quot; <i>Think nothing but positive affirmations this morning, Xena.</i> She
reminded herself. </p>

<p>Stepping out of the doorway to greet the sun, she almost tripped over a
large bowl of fruit and a pitcher of juice. &quot;Looks like we had visitors already this
morning, Gabrielle.&quot; Reaching down to retrieve the offerings she also noticed a bowl
of blue war paint and what looked to be articles of clothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like they have a Ceremonial Challenge outfit,&quot; Xena
chuckled as she walked back into the room with the bounty in her arms. She put the food
and drink down on the table and turned to her mate. &quot;I think this is what you are
supposed to wear.&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle stopped dressing and looked up at what her warrior was
swinging in the air. &quot;By the Gods, Xena &#150; there&#146;s nothing to it.&quot; She
grabbed the two pieces of dark blue cloth out of her lover&#146;s hands and examined them
closely. &quot;It&#146;s just a pair of panties and a breast covering.&quot; The look on
her face was priceless and Xena couldn&#146;t help but laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;What in Tartarus do you find so damn amusing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well ever since we&#146;ve been together you clothing has become
more and more revealing, and this, my darling, is the epitome of divulgence. I do believe
it is only one step from being stark naked.&quot; By this time the warrior was beside
herself with laughter.</p>

<p>Sternly glaring into sparking sapphire eyes, Gabrielle shook the
offending clothing in her lover&#146;s face. &quot;Well, will you still be laughing, when
the entire village is gaping at me wearing these two small pieces of nothingness?&quot;</p>

<p>The laughter subsided abruptly and a scowl took the place of the
ear-to-ear grin. &quot;No, as a matter of fact. Maybe you should start a new tradition and
wear your own clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing now that the tables had been consciously turned, a smile of
satisfaction appeared on the bard&#146;s face. &quot;No, that wouldn&#146;t be prudent. I
need to &#145;allow them to retain some of their traditions to keep the tribe
intact&#146;, remember Xena?&quot;</p>

<p>With a deep sigh of resignation the warrior agreed, &quot;Yes,
Gabrielle, I remember.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle exchanged her own clothes for the skimpy attire that had been
left for her and grabbed a small piece of fruit. &quot;I&#146;m starving, but I know I
shouldn&#146;t eat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There will be plenty of time for feasting after the
challenge.&quot; Xena&#146;s eyes narrowed as a look of deep concern came over her face.
&quot;Are you feeling okay, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel fine, Xena,&quot; Gabrielle assured her. &quot;A few
flutterbyes in the stomach, if you know what I mean, but other than that &#150; I&#146;m
ready to go.&quot;</p>

<p>As they were about to leave the hut, the sound of heavy, stomping
footsteps gave them pause. &quot;What in Tartarus . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! You two up?&quot; Eve&#146;s voice rang through the door,
well before her face made an appearance. </p>

<p>Xena shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Well, I did tell her to make her
presence known before barging in,&quot; she admitted.</p>

<p>&quot;At least she listens to you,&quot; the bard countered, smiling
also. To the woman just entering, she answered, &quot;Yes, Eve. Not only are we up but we
were just getting ready to leave.&quot;</p>

<p>Eve took one look at Gabrielle and was taken back, &quot;Mom . . .
that&#146;s . . . &quot; she pointed at the outfit, &quot; . . . you&#146;re almost . .
.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Naked,&quot; Xena finished her daughter&#146;s sentence. &quot;It
what the well-dressed defender of titles seems to be wearing today.&quot; That remark got
a nasty look from the green-eyed monster standing next to her as well as a punch on the
arm. </p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know very well What?&quot; Gabrielle reprimanded.
&quot;Let&#146;s go get this over with.&quot; As she walked past Eve, her daughter grabbed
her arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Mom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What Eve?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You have to put the paint on your face. I heard the women talking
in the hut last night and it&#146;s some kind of superstition. They believe that the paint
gives you the power to concentrate and do your best. It&#146;s got some special herbs or
something it in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of herbs?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t know, they&#146;re supposed to make you stronger and
more adept.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like cheating to me, Eve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Mom &#150; it isn&#146;t. Tecmessa has the exact same potion
in her paint.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That doesn&#146;t make any sense at all. If we both have the same
potion then we&#146;ll be equal again; it would be the same as if neither of us put it
on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, I know for a fact that Tecmessa Is putting it on, so you
must, also.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked over at Xena and the warrior seemed to agree with Eve.</p>

<p>&quot;Great I have to drug myself up now. I was doing fine on my own
adrenaline.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s probably more psychological than anything, Gabrielle.
If your mind thinks it gives you more power than it probably will. My guess would be that
you should believe it will work; you know Tecmessa believes in the magic.&quot; Xena
turned to Eve. &quot;Did the sisters say if the Shamaness mixed up the potions?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they did and they said there was one sister present from
each side of the challenge, one who wants Mom to remain Queen and one who wants Tecmessa,
so the potions are equal in strength.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle grabbed the bowl and stood in front of the looking glass.
&quot;Here goes nothing.&quot; She adorned her face with the blue paint that matched her
clothing. One long streak across her forehead, one down each cheek and one from her bottom
lip down to the tip of her chin. With some remaining in the bowl she dipped her fingers in
again and this time painted two lines from her elbows to her wrists. &quot;These two
lines,&quot; she stated as she pointed to the ones on her left hand, &quot;will stand for
you and me fighting side by side, Xena.&quot; Then turning to Eve she pointed to the two
on her right arm. &quot;These stand for you and me, Eve. I&#146;m taking you both into the
arena with me. Now let&#146;s get this over with before I change my mind.&quot; She picked
up the staff she had chosen the evening before and walked toward the exit.</p>

<p>As the three women began to leave the hut, they were met by a fairly
large contingent of Amazons who had come to walk with them to the ceremonial grounds. A
cheer went up as they started down the path to the Challenge of the Queens.</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Gabrielle &#150; May the best Amazon win!&quot; The chant
followed them all the way to the grassy knoll. When they reached their destination, the
opposing group of sisters surrounding their own champion, Tecmessa, met them. </p>

<p>&quot;Queen Gabrielle,&quot; Tecmessa nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Tecmessa,&quot; Gabrielle returned the nod.</p>

<p>An arbitrator stepped between the two women, with Gabrielle dressed in
dark royal blue and Tecmessa in bright red. &quot;Would the Queens be so kind as to step
into the arena?&quot;</p>

<p>Following the instructions, they did as they were asked. They stood
&#150; each holding her staff in an upright position with one end firmly on the ground and
the other head level. Looking into each other&#146;s eyes, there was not a trace of fear
between them.</p>

<p>The arbitrator raised her hands above her head and turned to address
the crowd. &quot;On this day will be decided who of the two Queens will rule this tribe.
To my right, the Bard Queen, Gabrielle of legend.&quot; A mighty roar went up from the
crowd. The speaker continued, &quot;To my left the Reigning Queen, Tecmessa.&quot; The
statement was answered by yet another thunderous cheer. &quot;This challenge is a fight to
the death.&quot;</p>

<p>Eve gasped, not having known the way of the Amazons and turned to her
mother. Xena looked at her daughter with haunted blue eyes &#150; there was no sign of a
smile upon the warrior&#146;s face. She leaned over and whispered into her daughter&#146;s
ear, &quot;Gabrielle will not die on this field, I promise you that.&quot; With that she
turned back to listen to the final announcement, proclaiming the commencement of the
battle.</p>

<p>&quot;May the best Amazon win.&quot;</p>

<p>The arbitrator stepped out of the circle the women were standing in and
the challenge was begun.</p>

<p>Gabrielle stood still, her staff with the bird&#146;s head held
shoulder high and parallel to the ground waiting for Tecmessa to make the first move.
Normally she would have removed the ornament before fighting, but this was a special
challenge and the future of the Amazons deserved to be won with a ceremonial flare. <i>For
Ephiny! For all who came before her and all who come after!</i> The arrogant Amazon fell
right into Gabrielle&#146;s plan. The small blonde could see that the larger woman was not
as agile as she was, nor did she seem to have the same degree of dexterity with
Gabrielle&#146;s weapon of choice. She came at Gabrielle full kilter, sweeping the staff
in the air. As she came closer to the smaller woman, Gabrielle undercut the weapons
thrust, throwing the charging woman off balance. The blonde then kicked her opponent in
the side. </p>

<p>Tecmessa regained her footing and struck back with a full swing. Staffs
caught in mid-air, one parallel to the ground, the other nearly perpendicular. The two
were at a stand off as Gabrielle pushed forward, causing Tecmessa to back up slightly.</p>

<p>The reigning Queen was quick on her feet, but Gabrielle was quicker as
she twirled her staff like a baton and swung first to the left, with her staff being met
by her opponents and then to the right where she struck the taller woman&#146;s shoulder
with a jolting blow. The crowd heard a loud crack and Tecmessa cringed in pain. </p>

<p>While she still had the advantage, Gabrielle swept her weapon low,
catching Tecmessa at the back of her knees and toppling her onto the ground. </p>

<p>A shout went up from one section of the crowd. &quot;Queen Gabrielle,
Queen Gabrielle!&quot; </p>

<p>The felled Queen scrambled to her feet, grabbing her staff from the
ground and began swinging at the Bard Queen, a swing to the head and a miss . . . another
swing to the abdomen . . . hitting it&#146;s target and knocking the wind from the smaller
woman and causing her to stumble backward.</p>

<p>As Tecmessa came closer, Gabrielle swung high and hit her on the right
side of her face, causing blood to spurt from a gash in her cheek, made by the weapon. She
shook off the intensity of the attack and regained her composure, spinning full circle and
coming back at the small blonde with a vengeance. The larger Amazon levied her weapon at
the Bard&#146;s mid-section but instead made contact with the quick woman&#146;s staff.</p>

<p>A roar of exaltation went up from the crowd with the block, making the
reigning Queen even more determined. She jumped up and forward, landing a powerful foot in
Gabrielle&#146;s side, causing the blonde to stagger. Tecmessa then swung again at the
Bard, a diagonal overhead swing to the right, blocked by Gabrielle, then another diagonal
overhead swing to the left. When Gabrielle attempted to block the second strike, her hand
caught the full impact of the blow. Small knuckles were caught for an instant between the
clashing staffs. The impact caused them to crack open, and blood began oozing slowly from
the fissures.</p>

<p>Standing on the sidelines, Xena&#146;s breath caught in her throat as
she watched the red liquid flow from her lover&#146;s fingers. Barley able to keep her
composure, she steeled herself and continued to watch.</p>

<p>A cheer from the other side of the audience egged Tecmessa on, and she
increased her attack, running toward the small blonde, who ducked a head swipe and caught
the taller woman in the back of her knees, throwing her off balance and onto the ground.
Undaunted, Tecmessa regained her balance as she staggered to a standing position and came
up swinging.</p>

<p>The groans of the two women became louder as the challenge continued.
Again, Gabrielle swept Tecmessa&#146;s feet from under her, and watched as the woman
scrambled to stand up. Screaming angrily, Tecmessa charged at the blonde, hitting her
squarely in the abdomen with her outstretched staff and knocking the wind out of
Gabrielle. </p>

<p>Grabbing her stomach, Gabrielle glared at her competitor; furious green
daggers shot from her eyes. &quot;This is getting ridiculous!&quot; She screamed. She
faced her enemy and as she approached close proximity to the woman she landed a damaging
strike by jumping up and kicking high, again jarring the already damaged shoulder.</p>

<p>Another cheer for Queen Gabrielle filled the arena as the taller woman
attempted to shake off the assault. Gabrielle quickly countered with her staff, hitting
the now injured woman in the side and again in the back when she turned to get her
balance.</p>

<p>The crowd went wild and then hushed as the two Amazons continued their
fight. </p>

<p>At one point when they were particularly close, the taller woman caught
the Bard off guard, when she landed a fist to Gabrielle&#146;s face, causing the
blonde&#146;s lip to split. </p>

<p>At the sight of the swelling mouth, Xena again had to pull in her
temper to keep from interfering.</p>

<p>Gabrielle licked the warm red fluid from her mouth and with
determination, increased her assault on her opponent.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the women were fairly evenly matched and each was
receiving her share of bruises and cuts. It was also apparent that they were both
beginning to tire. </p>

<p>Gabrielle delivered an incredible blow, which landed the taller woman
on her knees, and then she jammed the staff into Tecmessa&#146;s chest, causing her to
gasp for air.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Gabrielle was distracted as a sharp cry arose from somewhere
in the crowd. She was taken off guard for but a split second, but that was enough to let
Tecmessa gather her composure and right herself. With the Bard&#146;s head turning back
toward her, the Amazon made good use of the opportunity and used her staff as a club,
hitting Gabrielle with a forceful blow to her low back.</p>

<p>Silence from the throng, as the blonde went down on her face in the
dirt. Xena stood, readying her chakram. A young sister, standing to the right of Xena,
partially covered the more experienced woman&#146;s large hand with her own. &quot;This
must be a fair fight to the finish Xena,&quot; the brave young woman announced, daring to
look the warrior in the eyes. &quot;No one can interfere. Not even you.&quot; </p>

<p>Returning her attention to the other half of her soul, Xena sat back
down. She knew full well that should her Gabrielle be put into a position where mortal
harm was inevitable, not all the fire in Tartarus would be able to stay the toss of her
chakram toward the now reigning queen. </p>

<p>But, for now she merely watched as the vicious Tecmessa stood over her
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>Tecmessa raised her staff and just as she was about to deliver a mighty
blow to golden tresses, Gabrielle flipped onto her back, grabbed the dropped staff with
her right hand and stabbed her opponent sharply in the stomach, catching her totally off
guard. Jumping up, she again brought her weapon around and hit the already bleeding
shoulder with a fierce blow.</p>

<p>Tecmessa let out a cry of anguish as she dropped her staff doubling
over in pain. Another amazing swing and Gabrielle landed the weapon in the Amazon&#146;s
side. The reigning Queen went down on her knees at which point Gabrielle positioned
herself in front of the weaponless woman and fixed her staff into a lethal position. One
quick move and Tecmessa&#146;s neck would be broken. </p>

<p>Uncontrolled tears of agony streamed down the now beaten woman&#146;s
face. Tecmessa looked up into the eyes of the defending Queen. Even with all the fight
drained from her, the Amazon&#146;s pride would not be squelched. &quot;Go ahead, Bard
Queen, finish the task,&quot; she dared.</p>

<p>&quot;Tecmessa,&quot; Gabrielle began, &quot;us fighting amongst
ourselves and killing off our best warriors is a waste of precious Amazon blood. I am
going to give you a choice, but being killed is not among the options.&quot;</p>

<p>Still holding the staff on the defeated woman&#146;s neck Gabrielle
looked out at her subjects. </p>

<p>&quot;I will not kill your former Queen; that would be a dereliction of
my duty as your reinstated leader and a grave loss for the Amazon Nation. I will, however,
give her a choice, and I hope she is Amazon enough to see the greater good behind the
pride of this challenge and make an honorable Amazon decision &#150; one that is good for
the entire tribe, not just for her and her small following.&quot;</p>

<p>Again Gabrielle turned to Tecmessa, but this time spoke loud enough for
the entire tribe to hear. &quot;Tecmessa I will not destroy what is important to the
Amazons as a nation. You and yours are part of our history. Your relatives fought hard for
the privilege to be called Amazons, as did you just now. I beseech you not to give up that
birthright and to join me as a leader in my royal guards. Stand by my side with your
followers and make this tribe stronger. Your only other choice is to take yourself and all
who would leave with you away from here immediately and never set foot into this village
again. I hope you decide on the former choice; you are an asset to this tribe
Tecmessa.&quot;</p>

<p>With that Gabrielle removed the staff from its lethal position and
stood back, awaiting the former Queen&#146;s decision.</p>

<p>At first Tecmessa remained on her knees, slowly looking around drinking
in the entirety of the village with her eyes. She cautiously reached over and picked up
her staff where it lay, and leaning on it she rose to her feet. The now defeated Queen
stood towering over Gabrielle a look in her eyes of respect that the smaller woman had not
seen the royal Amazon bestow on any of her sisters. </p>

<p>&quot;To be honest with you Queen Gabrielle I thought you would be an
easy victory. I had heard of you assigning your Champion to your first challenge as Queen
and expected you to do the same today. As it turns out you are not only an adept warrior
but a charitable Queen as well. I would be foolish to become your enemy. You are also
correct in realizing that this village needs me as well as it needs you. Therefore, I
accept your terms.&quot;</p>

<p>Extending her hand, the former Queen clasped the reinstated
Queen&#146;s arm in a gesture of sisterhood and alliance. She then stepped back. With one
knee on the ground and the other in a bent position, Queen Tecmessa gave up her throne and
bowed to the Bard Queen Gabrielle. </p>

<p>The entire village went wild. </p>

<p>Gabrielle turned to her subjects and held up both her hands demanding
silence. The assemblage hushed and Gabrielle began speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;As first order of business I want to inform all of you that my
name is Gabrielle and unless it is a formal or ceremonial occasion that is how I prefer to
be addressed. I will accept the respectful head nod before addressing me and any other
honors that are afforded me as your Queen, but I do not want to be beyond the reach of any
individual in the tribe. We are all here for the good of all. And now I think we may have
cause for another celebration.&quot; She smiled as wide as her injured lips would allow at
her subjects.</p>

<p>It was at that point all Tartarus broke loose. Amazons scattered and
re-converged into small groups, discussing how to make the evenings festivities even more
spectacular than they had been the night before.</p>

<p>Gabrielle didn&#146;t need to search to find Xena and Eve; they were
running toward her. She walked slowly in their direction, her body aching all over. When
the two women reached her, she handed her staff to Eve and placed her arms around her
warrior&#146;s waist, her body shaking from relief. Xena held her close and kissed the top
of her head gently.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m very proud of you, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gods, Xena &#150; I thought I&#146;d lost it there for a
minute.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior did not admit to her own doubts or the incident that almost
caused the chakram to be thrown. &quot;I never doubted you, my love. You&#146;ve brought
your village back together and everyone will profit from that.&quot; She tilted the fair
face up until sea-green eyes were looking into the loving sapphire orbs that lit up her
soul. Xena bent down and tenderly kissed the split lip, then reached for the hand with the
injured knuckles and softly kissed them as well. &quot;We&#146;ll have you as good as new
in no time, my love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&#146;re just minor bruises and cuts, they&#146;ll heal
easily. We&#146;ve been through worse.&quot; She started to smile but it hurt, so she
simply placed her head back down on her lover&#146;s chest and held her tightly.</p>

<p>Eve threw her arms around her mothers and addressed Gabrielle.
&quot;Well, Mom, looks like that reinstates the two of us.&quot; Nodding her head toward
her mother she continued, &quot;Now what are we going to do about getting her into the
Royal Family?&quot;</p>

<p>Xena swatted her gently on the top of the head and Gabrielle chuckled
to herself. &quot;Actually, that&#146;s the next order of business. It looks like this
tribe really gets into parties; I wonder what they&#146;ll do when they&#146;re told to
prepare for a Royal Wedding?&quot;</p>

<p>She turned back to her warrior and gave her a hug. &quot;As much as I
want to start on the preparations for that, my love, today is not the time. Right now all
I want to do is sit down and have someone serve me something to eat and drink!&quot;</p>
