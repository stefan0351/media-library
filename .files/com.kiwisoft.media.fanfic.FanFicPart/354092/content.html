<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 24 -->

<p>Cynthia Gale rolled her eyes then turned to smile at her mother warmly as
she made puking sound effects in her head.  Ah, family dinners, what heinous
torture they were.  She couldn't believe that she was missing lady's night
at "The Mirror" AND the Chanel boutique so that she could share spaghetti
and garlic bread with her parents and her bratty younger brother-or as she
liked to refer to him "the accident". Considering, not for the first time,
setting off her own beeper she lazily rolled her head to the side.  'Well,
that's interesting," she thought to herself as she gazed at a table off to
the corner of the restaurant.  'What the hell is that,' she continued to
think as she straightened up and focused more intently on the table.</p>

<p>She thought that she saw Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen sitting there.
Unless, they had somehow been miraculously cloned, she was sure that she saw
Sam McPherson and Brooke McQueen.  They were sitting, together, at a table
for two.  Cynthia was confused.</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke hated each other.  Everyone knew that.  There were certain
universal truths in the world, Cynthia thought to herself: Not counting
Pamela Lee, Celine Dion was Canada's biggest shame, kid's who played
Dungeons and Dragons would end up thirty-year old virgins, you didn't where
a swim-suit in L.A. unless you had a suitable tan to go along with it, and
Sam and Brooke were bitter enemies.  She had been in the cafeteria that
fateful day of the most destructive food-fight in Kennedy High's history.
She had seen it's propagators, the darkly beautiful Sam and the sunshine
perfect Brooke glare at each other with the white hot intensity of a sun
before they began flinging food at each other that afternoon, she had read
the scathing newspaper articles, and seen the grown-up version of red rover
played in the hallways.  She had witnessed first hand the unpleasantness
that was Brooke and Sam's relationship, and the fact that she now saw them
sitting down to what looked like a civil dinner with each other just didn't
compute.</p>

<p>She turned to face her mother with a glassy expression.  "What?"</p>

<p>"I said, isn't that Jane McPherson's daughter?" her mother repeated looking
over at the table Cynthia herself had just been studying.</p>

<p>"Well, the brunette is Sam McPherson so I think it's a definite
possibility," Cynthia responded dryly causing her mother to frown.</p>

<p>"Why are you like that?" her mother asked in response.</p>

<p>"Like what?"  Cynthia responded tiredly.</p>

<p>"Don't use that tone with me," her mother replied.</p>

<p>"What tone?"</p>

<p>"You know what tone."</p>

<p>"If I knew what I tone, I wouldn't have asked what tone?"</p>

<p>"Don't get fresh with me young lady!"</p>

<p>"Oh Lord," Cynthia groaned, immediately regretting it.  It was going to be a
long night.</p>

<p>Brooke observed Sam thoughtfully, studying her face in the pale orange glow
of the candlelight, watching the way the shadowed shifted and swayed across
her features, making the face the Brooke had studied so intently and so
lovingly mysterious and familiar to her all at once.  She thought that she
would never get tired of looking at that face, that it would always be a
wonder to her.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked snapping herself out of the daze she'd been in.</p>

<p>"I asked if you noticed anything strange about the way my mom was acting
today?" Sam repeated with a smile.  The truth was Brooke wasn't the only one
with a wandering mind.  Sam had been in a somewhat dreamlike state since
they had left the house, she couldn't quite seem to wrap her mind around the
idea that they were actually out on a date, a real date.  She felt like she
should have been anxious, or jumpy or something, but it all just seemed so
natural.  It was like they had done it a million times before.  But, Sam
thought to herself, even though her entire relationship with Brooke had been
a series of new experiences, it had never really felt that alien, it was
more like they were just getting comfortable.</p>

<p>"N…" Brooke started to respond but she stopped and crinkled her brows
together in thought.  "Maybe," she responded, thinking about how she had
found Jane that afternoon for the first time.  "She seemed a little out of
it when I came home, but I wouldn't say strange exactly. Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, either I'm more of a hermit than I thought or something's
going on with her, because when I told her I was going out tonight her eyes
practically bugged out of her head and she stumbled all over her words until
I mentioned Carm and Lily," Sam responded with a rather perplexed look on
her face.  "It was like I had told her I was going on a crack run, or
enrolling in Mme. Butterfly's school for education of young wenches."</p>

<p>"Well," Brooke responded slowly.  "You are an attractive young woman, maybe
she really is worried about your virtue.  It's a big, bad, good-looking city
out there."</p>

<p>"Very funny."</p>

<p>"I'm serious.  Kind of," Brooke responded smiling.  "She's just being a
mom."</p>

<p>"I know, I just don't like it that's all," Sam responded with a  pout still
remembering with horror the lecture they had gotten after Jane had found
condoms in their washroom.  "Remember the condom speech?  Ugh," she
continued dramatically making a horrified face.  "I canNOT go throw that
again."</p>

<p>"There is a bright side," Brooke related in an up beat tone.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I won't have to sit through the speech this time," Brooke respond laughing
heartily, until   she caught the look in Sam's eyes, then she stopped,
immediately.  "Seriously though," she added sniffing and straightening up,
"I don't think we have anything to worry about.  I'm probably the last
person she'd look at, so really it's all good."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," Sam responded.  "It'll just make things more difficult
if she starts playing Jane McPherson: Middle Aged Detective. She watched
'Murder She Wrote', to much for me to be completely comfortable."</p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, then said "Sam," in a very grave tone, her
eyes never leaving the brunette's for a moment.  "Let's not talk about your
mother.  I mean no offense to her…but, truthfully … she's a buzz kill."  And
it was true.  Sam regarded Brooke for a moment then smiled, acknowledging
that she really didn't want to talk about her mother either.</p>

<p>"Tell me something about you that I don't know?"  Brooke asked a moment
later, looking at Sam softly but intensely.  Sometimes she would look at Sam
and think that for all the things she knew about the girl, for instance that
her ear lobes were particularly sensitive or that she really did like Shania
Twain, she really knew nothing at all.</p>

<p>"It'll take some of the mystery out of the relationship," Sam warned
somewhat uncomfortably.  It wasn't easy for her to let her defenses down,
she had spent so many of her prime years building them  up after all.
"Mystery is sexy isn't it?" she asked, but she already knew she would
answer.  Brooke did that to her, and truthfully she was glad she did.</p>

<p>"I don't want mystery, I want you," Brooke responded honestly.  She wasn't
going to force Sam to tell her anything, she was sure she would find out
everything she needed to know about Sam in time, it was just that she didn't
want to wait.  With everything that had happened between them over the past
few days, she just wanted something that would bring them closer together.</p>

<p>"When I was eight, I wanted to be a ballerina," Sam responded dipping her
head down slightly, looking at Brooke through her eyelashes.  She had never
told anyone but her mother this.  "I had the heart…but I didn't have the
feet," she continued with a touch of wistfulness to her voice.  "To this day
I can't listen to Abba without getting a little misty," she practically
groaned.</p>

<p>"Why Abba?" Brooke asked slightly perplexed.  She was with Sam up until she
mentioned the Swedes.  Besides, she decided that it was better to focus on
that part of the statement and not mention how absolutely adorable she
thought it was that Sam wanted to be a dancer.  The mental picture she was
getting of a little Sam in a too-too was almost too much for her.</p>

<p>"I know it's not spelt the same, but I was young, and not yet hooked on
phonics," Sam responded.  "The acronym for the American Ballet Association
is ABA," she continued, "or Abba, as I liked to think of it.  This, and the
fact that Abba sang Dancing Queen, just did it for me."</p>

<p>Brooke nodded somewhat solemnly, deciding to part with some information
herself.  After all, she too had had a childhood, and like most peoples it
was rather embarrassing, despite her fathers contention that it wasn't
embarrassing but precious.  "I always wanted to be She-Ra," Brooke revealed.
  "I even had a plastic sword … but Dad took it away when I kept poking
myself with it.  However, I still have the tiara."</p>

<p>Sam smiled and looked over at Brooke fondly, her eyes sparkling in the
candlelight.  She-Ra, oh lord.  "That explains so much," she whispered
meeting Brooke's gaze.  "You were a slow child weren't you?"</p>

<p>"A slow child with heart," Brooke informed her with a smile of her own.
"And just for the record, I like your feet."</p>
