<p>The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 5 by patricia51</p>
<p>(Well, once again Disney makes me adapt the story here to fit my own personal concepts. I've made rather a large deal out of Juliet and the sun and then I watch the fourth part and Juliet is walking in the Sub Station in broad daylight. So, I'm ignoring that and sticking with the traditional theme that sunlight is fatal to vampires. Oh and don't EVEN get me started on Juliet's bat wings at the end of Part 3. Does no one understand the cube/square law of lift? Fly sure, but do it ala "Forever Knight". No wings.)</p>
<p>Theresa Russo checked the over temperature. The biscuit dough she had made last night had risen and was ready to bake. The prepared pan went in the over and she bumped the door shut with her hip. She opened the refrigerator and got out the rest of the stuff for breakfast for her family. As she broke the eggs and began to whip them with a fork she heard a hesitant tapping at the door.</p>
<p>Who in the world could that be? Theresa set the bowl down and crossed to the door. She threw the deadbolt and turned the handle. It was dark outside but the light from the kitchen lit the form and face of the teenager in front of her.</p>
<p>"May I please come in Mrs. Russo?"</p>
<p>Theresa's first inclination was to say 'No". This was the girl who had caused a major disruption in her family. Oh, she knew who this was, yesterday after the revealing conversation with Alex she had slipped away and spied on the Late Nite Bite herself. So she recognized Juliet instantly.</p>
<p>First thoughts were chased out of her head as she looked closely at the young girl on their steps. Her eyes were puffy, obviously from crying and her face and clothes were tear-stained. The lost look in her eyes made Theresa want to cry herself.</p>
<p>The volatile Hispanic Mother hesitated not a second more. She reached out and pulled Juliet into her arms and into the kitchen, closing the door with a thrust of her foot. The teen vampire clung to her and Theresa could feel the slender body shaking as sobs started once more. Automatically she stroked the long brown hair, murmuring reassurances as she did.</p>
<p>After a while the tense body against hers relaxed and Juliet lifted her head from the shoulder it had pillowed on.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I have no right to come here. I know that I've caused trouble in your family and I'm sorry for that too. But I had no idea where else to go." The young woman went on to explain what had taken place when she had told her parents about her and Alex.</p>
<p>Theresa sighed and brushed the tears from Juliet's face. She thought of how she and Jerry had reacted the previous day. Hopefully their motives had been a little better that the Van Heusons but did it come down to the same thing? She thought not. Looking in the eyes of this woebegone girl in front of her she saw no trace of any frightening creature of the dark. Rather she saw a girl who had been rejected by her parents for admitting whom she loved. A girl that needed comfort and understanding.</p>
<p>"It will be alright, Juliet," Theresa said gently as she guided the teen to a chair and seated her. "Now then, how about a nice hot cup of tea and something to eat?" The older woman actually blushed for a moment. "I mean, if you drink tea and eat things."</p>
<p>Even with the crushing emotional blow she had suffered Juliet couldn't help but giggle. "Yes, Mrs. Russo I'd love a cup of tea. And I do eat people food. It just doesn't nourish me."</p>
<p>"You need blood for that," Theresa said quietly even as she took the biscuits from the over, put them on the table and started the tea kettle.</p>
<p>"Yes," Juliet's voice was low but firm. She seemed to want to say more but couldn't seem to find the words.</p>
<p>The kettle whistled and Theresa made two cups of tea and slid one in front of Juliet. Cradling the other in her hands she sat down opposite the teenager.</p>
<p>"We told Alex that she couldn't see you anymore. Not because we were shocked at her falling for a girl but because you are a vampire. We, Alex's Dad and I, worried that you might hurt her physically, or worse. So I have to ask you this Juliet. Would you ever hurt my daughter?"</p>
<p>"No Mrs. Russo. I would starve before I ever did anything like that. I love her."</p>
<p>There was a muffled gasp from the hallway. Before either of them could even look around there was the sound of bare feet rushing across the wood floor. Alex skidded to a stop beside Juliet and flung her arms around the other teenager.</p>
<p>"I love you too."</p>
<p>Theresa crossed to the doorway Alex had just entered from and in a loud voice summoned the rest of the family. One by one the three Russo men appeared, taking in the scene immediately. Max's eyes opened wide in surprise before getting a glint in them that reminded Theresa that she and Jerry hadn't had that talk with their youngest yet. Justin looked as surprised but he gave a nod of that bespoke of definite approval.</p>
<p>Finally the senior Russo ambled in the kitchen, still rubbing sleep from his eyes. He stopped dead in his tracks. Shifting his gaze back and forth from his wife to the sight of his daughter clutching a long haired brunette who obviously was the girl that all the fuss and bother recently had been about he didn't say anything but rather lifted one eyebrow in question.</p>
<p>"Sit down everyone." Theresa directed her family. Once everyone was settled she started serving the breakfast she had continued to prepare during all the excitement. She sat down with everyone and looked around.</p>
<p>"Okay everyone, this is where we are." She proceeded to summarize the recent events and then went on to tell the family about Juliet's parting with her parents, her arrival here and the discussion the pair of them had. She noted that Jerry, rather than being upset about Alex and Juliet, was growing angry at her description of Juliet's treatment by her parents. She rather thought he would react that way. Jerry was fiercely protective of his children and the idea that anyone else wouldn't be that same way simply infuriated him.</p>
<p>"I don't think there is any doubt as to the feelings between Juliet and Alex. And heaven knows we can't, for obvious reasons, just have Juliet leave. She's going to have to have a place to stay and I think it should be here." Theresa looked around the room. "Any comments?"</p>
<p>"What have they done wrong besides fall in love?" said Justin in a reasonable tone of voice. He got a thoughtful look on his face. "As hard as it is to imagine Alex NOT doing something wrong. Anyway," he continued as Alex tried to interrupt, "I'd say she stays."</p>
<p>"Max?"</p>
<p>"Cool," was all the youngest Russo sibling said. Theresa and Jerry shared the look again.</p>
<p>"Tonight. I promise."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Before anyone could ask exactly what that cryptic exchange between the parents was about Jerry took his turn.</p>
<p>"Alex, I want you to know that my objections to you being with Juliet had nothing to do with you both being girls. I promise you that when I announced that I was marrying your Mother my family lost it completely. 'Marry a mortal? Why it just isn't done! The whole idea is simply not to be thought of!' So I know about people's prejudices. My refusal to allow your dating was solely because I worried about you." He turned to the other girl. "Juliet, I hope you'll forgive me, but you do have to admit that vampires do not have a very good reputation. My only purpose in forbidding the pair of you from seeing each other was concern for the safety and well-being of my daughter."</p>
<p>"I understand Mr. Russo," Juliet acknowledged.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Russo is a darn good judge of character and I trust her. So if she believes you then so do I. So please Juliet, consider our home is also yours. And the pair of you have our family blessing for dating."</p>
<p>Juliet nearly burst into tears again. This time though they were tears of happiness. She circled the room, hugging each of the Russos in turn before returning to sit next to Alex and hold her hand.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she said softly.</p>
<p>"Err, one thing we haven't thought about," mentioned Jerry nervously. "Sleeping arrangements."</p>
<p>Theresa looked thoughtful. "There really is only one choice. She'll have to sleep in Alex's room." As the two girls brightened and smiled at each other she fixed them with a stern look. "Separate beds."</p>
<p>"We need to reinforce the curtains there too," added Jerry. "In fact, all through the house. Shutters, GOOD shutters would be something we should get as soon as possible too.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, you three need to get ready for school. Juliet can help me start rearranging the furniture. By chance do you know how to use a sewing machine?" she asked the teen vampire, who admitted that she had no idea. "That's alright, neither does Alex. Well, maybe I can teach you as we make some thicker curtains." She returned her attention to her children. "Scoot!"</p>
<p>Before long all three Russo children were ready for school. Justin and Max left, the latter under protest. Jerry and Theresa studied the ceiling while Alex kissed and hugged Juliet tightly. When the soon mutual embrace and kiss went on long enough both parents cleared their throats loudly. The girls parted and blushed.</p>
<p>"On your way,' Theresa directed her daughter. "She'll be here when you get home."</p>
<p>Alex gave Juliet a last look, full of longing but also full of happiness and left. Jerry headed out shortly after to begin the day at the Sub Station. He paused long enough to wrestle a ladder and measure some windows so he could call a wood working friend about shutters. Theresa smiled at Juliet.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's get to work."</p>
