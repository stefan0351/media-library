		"Report!" Janeway said as she strutted onto the bridge, still dressed in her civies, a white shirt and a pair of black pants. Ensign Lang was right behind her, also dressed in her civies. She moved towards Ops and patiently awaited for Harry to give her something to do. Seven was in the next car to visit the bridge and she took the science station directly behind the captain's chair.</p>

		<p>"The pirates appeared out of no where and fired," Harry said. "Luckily, we had the deflector dish hidden. Now they are firing on our shields."</p>

		<p>"Target their weapons, full phaser intensity. Fire," Janeway ordered, knowing her friend Tuvok would follow her orders to a >T.' </p>

		<p>"No effect," Tuvok said dispassionately.</p>

		<p>The ship rocked as another volley of weapons hit Voyager. Janeway went down, her head hitting the floor with a deadening thump. Chakotay and Seven looked at her for only a second, knowing that they needed to get out of this situation to save her crew and then save her. She would want it that way.</p>

		<p>Nicole Lang felt differently. She left her post by Harry, not doing much in the first place beyond holding on, and ran to Janeway.</p>

		<p>"Come on, Kathryn," she muttered as she held the captain in her arms. "You can't leave me now."</p>

		<p>"Is she alive?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. Probably a concussion," Lang said, tears filling her eyes. "Harry, are transporters on line?"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>Lang picked the captain up in her arms and carried her to the turbolift and down to sickbay. The bridge officers looked on briefly, surprised by the young ensign's dedication and the fact that she called her Kathryn.</p>

		<p>"Commander, I believe an electromagnetic pulse will short out their systems and allow us to disable their weapons," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"We would have to know their shield modulation," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"I have it," Harry said from his station. He sent it to Seven's station and Seven used the very deflector that they had tried to attack days before to send the EM pulse through the pirates' shields. All of their attacker's systems immediately went off line. Tuvok targeted their weapons banks and permanently disabled them. They wouldn't be able to use those specific weapons ever again.</p>

		<p>"We were successful," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Alien ship is hailing us," Harry said.</p>

		<p>"On screen," Chakotay ordered. "Good day, sir," he said sarcastically as a face, who he assumed was male, appeared on screen. Assumed because it looked a little more butch than femme, a lot rough around the edges, and a jaw clenched to the point of veins popping out of its forehead.</p>

		<p>"Why have you disabled our ship?" he asked.</p>

		<p>"You were attacking us. You left us no choice," Seven replied, more than a little out of turn.</p>

		<p>"Seven," Chakotay warned. "She is correct, however. You left us little choice. Why did you fire on us?"</p>

		<p>"You are in our path."</p>

		<p>"Sorry, but you didn't file one with the Federation. How did we know we were on your path?"</p>

		<p>"Are. Ignorance is not excuse for breaking the law. Prepare to be boarded."</p>

		<p>"You seem to be at a disadvantage. Who are you again?"</p>

		<p>"The Ooranni, the Usantic. We have many names."</p>

		<p>"And have stolen from many cultures. Good day, sir," Chakotay said as Harry ended the comm link. "Ensign Tal, point us home, warp six."</p>

		<p>Tal Celes did exactly as she was told and they tried to put as much distance between the pirate ship and their aft shields.</p>

		In sickbay, Ensign Lang looked on while the Doctor tended to the captain. Other assistant medics from the science department scurried around applying hyposprays and dermal regenerators and bone knitters. There weren't a lot of injuries, but those there were significant.</p>

		<p>Nicole didn't see any of the activity. She focused only on Kathryn and what the Doctor was doing to make her well.</p>

		<p>"She had a punctured lung and has a concussion, but she'll come out of it in a couple of hours. I've reduced the pressure on her brain, it's up to her to wake up now."</p>

		<p>"She will," Nicole said quietly but forcefully.</p>

		<p>"Is there something I should know about, Ensign?"</p>

		<p>"No, Doctor, I feel responsible for her."</p>

		<p>"You didn't cause the accident."</p>

		<p>"I know that. I'm not saying that I did. I just want to see her well."</p>

		<p>"We all do, Ensign."</p>

		<p>"Can I stay?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, for a little while. You'll need your rest, too. It's been a long day."</p>

		<p>"I'll go home after a little bit," she said with a slight smile. She pulled up a chair next to the biobed and took hold of the captain's hand. She eventually fell asleep to the sound of her breathing and heartbeat as her head laid on Kathryn's chest.</p>

		"What a day off," B'Elanna said as she plopped down on her couch. Seven copied the motion and quickly curled up against her lover.</p>

		<p>"I agree that it has been a most stimulating day."</p>

		<p>"Any news on the captain?"</p>

		<p>"She has a concussion and should be awake soon. It seems that she is sleeping more than unconscious, however."</p>

		<p>"I heard that Nicole Lang carried her to sickbay when the transporters were down."</p>

		<p>"She did. I have a feeling that something is going on there," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Oh, you do, do you?" B'Elanna asked with a smile.</p>

		<p>"Yes. Ensign Lang is very attractive, do you not think?"</p>

		<p>"I agree. I just never thought of the captain as a lady's woman. Then again, I never thought of myself as much of one, either."</p>

		<p>"Because you are only a Seven woman. Perhaps Kathryn is only a Nicole Lang woman."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna laughed and held Seven closer.</p>

		<p>"Take a shower with me," Seven said, less of a question, and more of an order. It was the perfect impression of Captain Janeway.</p>

		<p>"Don't do that! I like your voice much better," B'Elanna said. She stood and through Seven over her shoulder. "But I will take a shower with you," she said as she placed a gentle pat on Seven's posterior. </p>

		<p>When they reached the bathroom, B'Elanna immediately found the clasp to Seven's suit and undid it. With steady hands she pulled Seven's clothes off and threw them aside, kissing up her naked body as she stood. Seven shivered and held B'Elanna's head close to her when her lips reached her breasts.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Lanna," she moaned. "I love you so much."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna chuckled, her lips surrounding a nipple. She quickly divided herself from her clothes and turned the water on in the shower, all without breaking contact with Seven's body. B'Elanna's lips met Seven's and they kissed deeply as the shorter woman pushed the taller woman against the wall of the shower.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna massaged Seven's breasts and nibbled at her bottom lip. One of Seven's legs wrapped around B'Elanna's hip.</p>

		<p>"Please, Lanna," Seven begged.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna complied and brought her right hand down between Seven's legs. With her first two fingers she traced the blonde's crease from top to bottom, not at all surprised at the thick liquid, not water, that accumulated there. Seven gasped and B'Elanna pushed her fingers inside her ready lover. She pumped them in and out of her, eliciting a sigh and moan with each movement.</p>

		<p>It didn't take long for Seven to come. She had been ready since before the attack when they were laying in bed trying to make love earlier. She came hard, her screams echoing in the tiled bathroom. At the end of it, she was shaking and B'Elanna held her close.</p>

		<p>"You are so good to me," Seven said, a grin on her face.</p>

		<p>"I try," B'Elanna said, kissing her sweetly.</p>
