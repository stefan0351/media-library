<p style="text-align:center;"><b>7</b></p>
<p>At three o'clock the next morning Miley reached to the upper bunk and tapped Lilly on the shoulder. "Wake up," she whispered.</p>
<p>Lilly swung her legs over the side and jumped down lightly. "I wasn't sleeping."</p>
<p>The two girls dressed quickly and slipped out of Cabin 13, shutting the door gingerly behind them.</p>
<p>Trina had not gone to bed. Over-excited by the day's athletic victories and depressed by her treatment at the hands of her fellow counselors, she had found it impossible to settle down. There was too much to think about. Now she was pacing along the waterfront, trying to sort herself out. Was she happy? Sad? Jubilant? Angry? In several hours of walking and mumbling to herself, she had come to only one conclusion: her life had been just dandy until the day Miley Stewart had walked into it. Now everything had turned to mud.</p>
<p>She was just about to start down the row of cabins to her own when she caught a glimpse of two shadowy figures running towards the dock. Mystified, she watched them scamper across the dock and jump into a small motor boat. She stared. Then suddenly a single thought entered her head.</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart!</i>"</p>
<p>She began to run. She got to the dock just as the small boat roared away.</p>
<p>"Stewart, you come back here!" Frantically she hurled herself into the nearest motor boat, a tiny outboard. She landed too close to the stern and the small craft, overbalanced, tipped straight up. Trina went down standing up, still yelling. Bubbles rose from where she had sunk out of sight.</p>
<p>"Miley! Miley, did you see that?" cried Lilly, horrified.</p>
<p>"Yes." Miley was already turning the boat around and kicking off her shoes, ready to go into the water. "Lilly, take the wheel."</p>
<p>"Do we have to go back? Will we have to stay there?" Lilly babbled, grasping the steering wheel.</p>
<p>"Of course we have to go back," said Miley in disgust. "Do you want that big dumb clone on your conscience?" She dove gracefully into the water.</p>
<p>Trina surfaced barely two feet away. "<i>Stewart!</i> What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Rescuing you," replied Miley calmly.</p>
<p>"I don't need any rescuing, but <i>you</i> will when I get through with you!"</p>
<p>"Gee," said Miley, treading water, "you try to save a girl's life and that's the thanks you get."</p>
<p>Trina swam towards the dock. "Stewart, get out of the water! Truscott, is that you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," came a small voice.</p>
<p>"Well, dock that boat!" ordered Trina. She pulled herself onto the dock. Miley followed. They were met by an assortment of light sleepers from nearby cabins.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's going on here?" asked Kitty. "Hey, Trina, why are you all wet?"</p>
<p>"What do you want me to be when I come out of the lake?" Trina asked savagely. "<i>Dry?</i>"</p>
<p>Marina came rushing up. "What's happened here?"</p>
<p>Trina turned on her angrily. "My ringer, the girl I deliberately sprung on you to wipe you out on the playing fields, just tried to take off in a boat! What have you got to say to that?"</p>
<p>"If you hadn't fallen in, we would have made it too," Miley commented mildly.</p>
<p>"Take off?" Marina repeated. "In a boat? Why?"</p>
<p>"Because I don't like it here," supplied Miley. "As a matter of fact, I like it less every day."</p>
<p>"But—but you did so well yesterday!" stammered Marina.</p>
<p>"I don't play sports," explained Miley.</p>
<p>Marina was struck dumb.</p>
<p>Trina turned to Lilly. "And what about you, Truscott? Where did you think you were going?"</p>
<p>Lilly hung her head. "Home," she mumbled, pointing at Miley, "with her."</p>
<p>"You two girls are just a little homesick," Marina managed feebly.</p>
<p>"Campsick," Miley corrected. "As in sick of camp."</p>
<p>"This is serious," put in Kitty. "You're going to have to report it straight to Ms. Warden."</p>
<p>Miley's eyes gleamed. "There's nothing straight about Ms. Warden."</p>
<p>Lilly snickered nervously.</p>
<p>"First thing after breakfast," said Trina. "But right now I'm freezing! Stewart—Truscott—march!"</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to chain our ankles together?" asked Miley innocently.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Stewart! You're in enough trouble!"</p>
<p>"If you get into too much trouble, do you get sent home?"</p>
<p>"<i>Move!</i>"</p>
<p>Right after breakfast Trina left Bunk 13 in Marina's charge and marched Miley and Lilly to the camp director's cottage. Ms. Warden met them at the door and showed them into the camp office. She seated them all in chairs opposite her desk.</p>
<p>"Well, now," she said sternly, "what's all this I hear about you two taking a boat without permission?"</p>
<p>"Actually, ma'am—" Trina tried to explain.</p>
<p>"Quiet, Trina," said Ms. Warden. "Now, listen, girls. This is Camp Algonkian Island. It was founded thirty-one years ago by my grandfather, Elias Warden, and in all that time not once, before today, has anyone taken a boat without permission."</p>
<p>"But, ma'am—" Trina interrupted. The director seemed to be missing the whole point in not seeing that Miley and Lilly had actually tried to run away.</p>
<p>"Trina, you will not interrupt me while I am speaking. Girls, do you know what the punishment is for taking a boat without permission?"</p>
<p>"Death?" asked Miley innocently.</p>
<p>There was a strangled cough from Lilly.</p>
<p>Ms. Warden chuckled forgivingly. "No, nothing so drastic as that," she said. "But I'm afraid I'll have to give you a good five days work detail. And I also insist that you each promise never to take a boat again without permission."</p>
<p>"I promise," chorused Miley and Lilly.</p>
<p>"Ma'am—" Trina put in desperately.</p>
<p>"Now, now, Trina," said the director reprovingly, "the girls are both sorry and they've both promised never to do it again."</p>
<p>Trina sighed. "Yes, ma'am. All right, guys, come on. We're late for letter writing."</p>
<p><i>Dear Mom and Dad,</i> wrote Miley. <i>How are you? I am okay. This certainly is a camp, all right. Only eight more days to visiting day. Your daughter, Miley.</i></p>
<p>"Stewart, what's this?" bawled Trina, reading over Miley's shoulder.</p>
<p>"My letter home," explained Miley calmly.</p>
<p>"It's the exact same letter you wrote last time."</p>
<p>"No it isn't," said Miley. "There were twelve days to visiting day then."</p>
<p>"Can't you think of anything better to write than that?"</p>
<p>"I tried to write an imaginative letter last time," said Miley. "You wouldn't let me mail it."</p>
<p>"Yeah," said Trina, "but it's word for word."</p>
<p>"Except for the eight," said Miley. "Anyway, I didn't think you'd want me to write about how you kicked in the cabin and broke the table and threw spaghetti at Ashley and jumped in the lake—twice."</p>
<p>"Never mind," sighed Trina. "This letter's good enough. All right, you guys! Time to play baseball! We're on a winning streak, you know!"</p>
<p>Miley turned to Lilly. "How about a little chess?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good to me," said Lilly.</p>
<p>"There goes our winning streak," muttered Sarah.</p>
<p>Trina bit her lip to stifle a cry of protest. It seemed to her that forcing Stewart to play sports had brought on her attempt to run away. Perhaps, if left alone, the girl would come to her senses.</p>
<p>"All right, you guys!" said Trina. She turned and bellowed, "Who's going to win?"</p>
<p>"They are!" chorused everyone.</p>
<p>"Awww," groaned Trina, "that's a terrible attitude! Stewart, Truscott, sure you won't change your minds? We can use you out there."</p>
<p>"No, thank you."</p>
<p>"Fine," said Trina painfully. "Come on, girls. Let's go."</p>
<p>As soon as the last camper was out the door, Lilly turned to Miley. "I'm not playing you in chess again," she said. "There's no point."</p>
<p>Miley nodded sadly. "Too true. I don't know about you, but I'm thinking a nap sounds good right about now."</p>
<p>"Why don't we get work detail over with first? Then we won't have to worry about it later," Lilly suggested.</p>
<p>"Right you are," Miley agreed, tossing her pen aside and holding out her hand for Lilly to take. "Shall we?"</p>
<p>Lilly stared at Miley's hand stupidly for a moment, but just as Miley began to retract it, Lilly slid hers into it and chuckled, reveling in the softness. "Let's do it," she said, pretending not to notice when Miley's hand squeezed hers tighter.</p>
<p>"This is the last of our two days work detail," grumbled Lilly, pushing her wheelbarrow down the path to the dump. "Tomorrow we can start serving our five."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow we do <i>not</i> start serving our five," said Miley. "At least I don't. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life as a free woman." She paused. "Have you decided whether or not you're coming?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded vigorously. "I'm coming all right!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Trina hasn't yelled at me once today," observed Miley, starting to dump her garbage bags. "Maybe she thinks a little loving kindness will stop me from wanting to escape." With athletic ease she tossed the last bag to the top of the heap. "Little does she know that nothing can stop me from wanting to escape from Alcatraz."</p>
<p>"Do you think they're going to make us play again?" asked Lilly.</p>
<p>"They can try," said Miley grimly. "Anyway, it's not important. We're not going to be here after tomorrow."</p>
<p><i>I've heard that before</i>, Lilly thought. But she did not dare say it aloud. Instead, she leaned her wheelbarrow up against a tree and folded her arms.</p>
<p>Miley did the same with her wheelbarrow, then pulled her iPod out of her back pocket. She scrolled through it for a minute while Lilly looked on.</p>
<p>"Aha! Wanna hear a cool song?" she asked, waving her iPod in the air.</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and unfolded her arms, walking up to Miley. Miley grabbed her elbow and steered her toward the path that lead to a small meadow. "Let's get out of the dump, shall we?"</p>
<p>"Right," Lilly nodded, enjoying the feeling of Miley's hand on her arm and frowning slightly when it left her. The two girls walked down the path a ways before reaching the clearing, and Miley scouted out a comfortable place to sit. She sat down and Lilly sat down close by, but not that close. She didn't want to give Miley the wrong idea.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Miley asked, staring at her.</p>
<p>"What, am I too close?" Lilly blurted anxiously.</p>
<p>Miley laughed. "No, not close enough. We have to be closer if we're both going to listen," she pointed out, and scooted herself so her side was pressed up against Lilly's.</p>
<p>Lilly fought the gasp that threatened to escape her lips at the sensation of having Miley so close to her. She bit her lip hard as Miley put the bud in, her fingers brushing the shell of Lilly's ear.</p>
<p>After putting the other bud in her own ear, Miley hit play and sighed contentedly. The first notes of an unfamiliar song filtered through, an intro consisting of light violin that was soon joined by a deeper cello and then suddenly, a heavy bass line dropped and Lilly's jaw hung open as she felt herself being carried away by the music. Miley smiled at Lilly's reaction, pressing her hand to Lilly's chin to shut her mouth. She started leaning back, and Lilly followed her lead so that they could both rest on their backs in the grass.</p>
<p>Lilly's eyes were closed, and Miley took the opportunity to study her face. Even without makeup (it was strictly forbidden in camp) Lilly was…mega hot. Beneath her calm exterior, Miley's heart beat a little faster than normal, and she grabbed a handful of grass, ripping it out when she felt the urge to reach out and touch Lilly.</p>
<p>The song came to a finish and Lilly's eyes opened, as if coming out of a trance. "That was incredible. Who was it?"</p>
<p>"Garage Band," Miley muttered, still watching Lilly's face.</p>
<p>"Whoa, those are some serious instruments for a garage band. What do they call themselves?"</p>
<p>Miley blushed slightly and turned her head so she was facing the treetops. "No, not <i>a</i> garage band," she clarified, "Garage Band. The computer program."</p>
<p>Lilly drew in a sharp breath of air and propped herself up on her elbow, looking down at Miley, who wasn't making eye contact. "Miley…did you write that song?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "It had words too, but I decided it sounded better just as an instrumental version."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head in amazement, settling back down. "You never stop surprising me," she said ruefully. "I shouldn't be surprised by anything at this point."</p>
<p>Miley sighed. "Don't tell anyone, all right? Nobody knows about the music thing. They can't."</p>
<p>Lilly grinned. "You're pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?" she said.</p>
<p>"It comes with the territory," Miley said grimly. She picked up her iPod to start scrolling through it again.</p>
<p>"Hey, hold on," Lilly said, nudging Miley's shoulder, "I want to hear that song again…and I want you to sing this time." She smiled. "I know you can."</p>
<p>Miley quirked an eyebrow. "I don't sing."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed and shook her head. "Consider this me forcing you," she said, taking the iPod and hitting play again. The violin started in.</p>
<p>"Okay, but I need to sit up," Miley acquiesced. Lilly sat up in compliance and the two sat shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>"Should I start it over?" Lilly asked.</p>
<p>"Nah, I don't come in until after the drums part," Miley said.</p>
<p>They listened as the cello wove in, and when the drums started, Lilly looked over at Miley. Miley's eyes were closed, and after a few more beats, she started singing.</p>
<p><i>I want to breathe her air</i></p>
<p><i>When I'm without her I'm nothing</i></p>
<p><i>Just let me breathe her air</i></p>
<p><i>She's my comfort, nothing else is</i></p>
<p><i>For her, I'd go anywhere</i></p>
<p><i>When we're alone together</i></p>
<p><i>What we have is rare</i></p>
<p><i>I'd sleep through every sunrise if it was with her</i></p>
<p>Lilly swallowed hard. She was mesmerized, staring at Miley's lips as the most beautiful voice she'd ever heard spilled from them. She hardly even heard the words to the song; she was so entranced by the singer. Miley started into the chorus at just the right time, and Lilly felt gooseflesh break out all over her skin.</p>
<p><i>I watch her, I want her</i></p>
<p><i>I want to be her</i></p>
<p><i>Be with her</i></p>
<p><i>Want to know her</i></p>
<p><i>Mostly want to escape</i></p>
<p><i>Run away from these times</i></p>
<p><i>And be a kid again</i></p>
<p><i>Free again</i></p>
<p><i>Maybe climb a tree again</i></p>
<p><i>Escape to a world of purity</i></p>
<p><i>Where it's just me and her and me</i></p>
<p><i>And her</i></p>
<p>Miley opened her eyes as the instrumentals took over and was startled to see Lilly looking at her intensely. When Lilly realized Miley wasn't singing anymore, and had her eyes open, she looked away embarrassedly.</p>
<p>Miley swallowed hard, and didn't continue singing. She started to lean in closer to Lilly. A snap and then a thump from a tree nearby startled the two, and Miley turned her head so fast the iPod bud fell from her ear. It was only a pinecone falling, but it did the trick—the spell was shattered and the moment passed.</p>
<p>Lilly looked up sheepishly. "Chess?"</p>
<p>"Chess."</p>
<p>Cabin 13 was noisy as the girls shuffled in from playing field hockey.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you missed that shot," Ashley snapped.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you almost scored for the other team," Sarah shot back.</p>
<p>"Girls!" Trina hollered above the cacophony of complaining. "That's <i>enough</i>! We did fine—granted we were all a little slow out there today, but we'll get 'em next time!" She was doing her best to sound enthusiastic but it was obvious that her spirits were flagging too. "Hit the showers and we'll go to dinner. Stewart, Truscott, that's enough chess for one day, go shower up and meet up in the mess hall."</p>
<p>"Wow!" said Trina sarcastically as she walked into the counselor's meeting that night. "That was a real dirty trick, Ruby, beating us nineteen to nothing at baseball. Almost as bad as you, Kitty, beating us twenty-one to nothing at soccer. They're real tricky, don't you think, Marina? Real tricky."</p>
<p>"Aw, come on, Trina, we're sorry about that," said Marina. "How were we to know? This Stewart isn't your average girl."</p>
<p>"I'd think you'd have taken my word for it!" snapped Trina.</p>
<p>"You're just cranky because you fell in the lake," laughed Chantel. "Anyway, where <i>was</i> your girl wonder today?"</p>
<p>"She and her accomplice were playing chess while we were getting clobbered at baseball," sighed Trina. "And while we were getting smashed at soccer. And in the afternoon while we were getting wiped out on the track and pulverized on the hockey field, they were playing chess."</p>
<p>"I still say you should force her to play," said Marina. "She's the only real athlete you've got."</p>
<p>"Yeah, and what about our camp teams?" added Kitty, wide-eyed with eagerness. "With a girl like Stewart on our teams we could clobber the whole north country. We're soon due to play Spruce Valley at baseball."</p>
<p>"And I've got to take a soccer team to Cedar Ridge," added Ruby. "We could sure use Stewart! I vote we force her."</p>
<p>"Nobody asked you," snapped Trina. "She's in <i>my</i> cabin. Last time we forced her to play she tried to run away the next morning. If you can convince her—bribe her, whatever—to play willingly, then fine. But nobody's going to force her. Understood?"</p>
<p>"But we could be the NorCal <i>champions!</i>" protested Marina. "We've <i>never</i> been the NorCal champions!"</p>
<p>"Tough," said Trina painfully. She would have given a lot to see Algonkian Island the NorCal champions. "The kid comes first. That's what we were taught, and that's what I'm going by."</p>
<p>"Can't we try?" whined Kitty.</p>
<p>"All you like," invited Trina. "But no threats."</p>
<p>The beaver was afraid. He had wasted half a day hiding when he should have been working. In the afternoon, two humans had appeared and settled themselves for a long time close to the dam. Their presence was menacing. But he must finish his dam and build his lodge—in spite of the humans.</p>
