<p><b>Haha, I started writing this in school. All sites are blocked EXCEPT for fanfiction. It's awesome. </b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A deep frown was scarring my features as I gazed down at my reflection after drinking the water from my cupped hands. The water rippled as fish danced beneath its surface and my face transformed into a deformed mess, reminding me of things I wished would vanish from my thoughts. Things that had brought me here. But, where is here? I don't know how long I ran for, how long I starved and thirsted for what I insistently denied myself of for endless days. Now I wanted food, any kind of food. I didn't care what it was so long as it got rid of my aching hunger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a crunching noise sounded behind me and I turned, peering into the deep forest of trees that surrounded me. I couldn't determine what had made the sound, but I knew it would end up being my first meal in so long considering anything would satisfy me more than a measly fish. I prepared myself for an attack, but I was surprised to see a horse poke its giant head through the brush and whinny at me. I stood up straight and relaxed my stance. I wasn't going to harm a horse. I smiled lightly as the animal inched forward, shyly and carefully. However, my smile fell when small hands launched through the overgrowth and parted the branches. A tall girl sat atop the horse and she guided the white beast into the opening where I was standing.</p>
<p>Our eyes met and I wanted to run, but I couldn't move. The horse came closer, though my sights were glued to this girl. Her hair was a soft shade of brown that fell in long curls past her shoulders and a white cowboy hat rested on her head. Her jeans were worn and her striped pink shirt was a bright contrast compared to her tanned skin shadowed by the canopy of the trees. She was an excessively pretty girl.</p>
<p>"Hey there," she greeted in a southern twang. Well, now I know where I am.</p>
<p>"Hi," I replied quietly.</p>
<p>"What're you doin' so far from town?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Uh, hiking," I lied, glancing at my duffel bag lying beside the riverbank.</p>
<p>"Oh, well the weather is perfect for that, I suppose. But for future reference, this property belongs to my daddy and I dunno if he'll be pleased with strangers wanderin' around on it."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't know. I don't really live around here."</p>
<p>"I can tell," she said with a grin. We fell into a silence and I wanted to leave, but I was so tired and so sick of running. I know fleeing was a reflex for me now, but I never enjoyed it, never enjoyed the plague of cowardice. Just once, I'd like to be brave and face my ghosts, but I just couldn't find the strength. "So, are you on vacation or somethin'?"</p>
<p>"You could say that…" There's no home for me anymore, I'm always travelling, so technically, I'm always on vacation.</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Lilly."</p>
<p>"I'm Miley. It's nice to meet you."</p>
<p>"Yeah…" I turned and retrieved my bag, glancing at Miley with a faux smile. "I better get going. I wouldn't want to continue with my trespassing."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's not a problem! You can explore this area if you'd really like. You have my permission," Miley said. I couldn't believe she was so kind. I hadn't been treated like this in a long time and her hospitality made me feel guilty for wanting so desperately to escape.</p>
<p>"Thanks." I walked as casually as I could down a narrow path that disappeared behind the trees and broke out into a sprint the moment I felt Miley's eyes relieve my back.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Miley ~</p>
<p>I groaned as I hoisted a large bale of hay over my shoulder and carried it up to the barn for the horses to munch on during the night. I made it to the top of the hill and raised an eyebrow in confusion when I found the barn's doors ajar. No one ever left the doors open. I bet it was Jackson! He was such a careless moron sometimes. I huffed and continued my trek towards the barn and pulled the door open with my free hand. My eyes widened at what I found.</p>
<p>"Hey!" I called and the sandy coloured dog eating out of the pigs' trough jumped and raised its head to look at me with startled blue eyes. Once I had a clear view of its face, I realised instantly that it wasn't a dog at all. I reached for the broom by the door and cautiously stepped closer to the animal. "Now be a good wolfy and go away. Go on, get," I prodded lightly, extending the bristled end of the broom forward until it nudged the wolf's hind leg gently. It remained immobile and continued to stare at me with a dejected gaze, its ears drawn back and tail between its legs. It was practically begging me to let it continue depriving the overfed pigs of their dinner.</p>
<p>Abruptly, I realised what exactly this creature fed upon and my head snapped up, searching for any missing animals or blood splattered about the barn. But to my surprise, and relief, the pigs were still intact, as were the horses and cows. Well, what a peculiar predator this little wolf was. Okay, not little. It was quite big, but being around horses all the time and other massive animals made other species tiny in comparison. "Huh," I breathed, glancing back at the wolf that still stood stiffly in the same position. "I guess I owe you for not slaughtering the other animals. Wait here. Uhh, I mean, stay," I demanded lamely, feeling stupid for thinking a wolf would understand domestic pet commands. Its ears perked up and it sat down, head tilted to one side, as if waiting. I smiled and shook my head in disbelief, leaving the barn to find something for the hungry and strangely obedient wolf.</p>
<p>I snuck some raw meat out of the freezer and heated it until the coat of ice had melted. I bounded from the kitchen, hoping not to be spotted by my dad or Jackson, and hastily went back to the visitor I prayed hadn't lost its graciousness and ate one of the pigs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the wolf hadn't moved from where I left it and its tail even wagged when I presented it with the meat. I lowered the plate to the ground and stepped back, giving it space just in case it was vicious when it came to protecting its food.</p>
<p>I sat down in the dirt, watching the wolf scarf down what little meat I'd supplied it with. There wasn't even a trace of it left after a few seconds. It licked the plate numerous times and then it raised its head and looked at me questioningly. I had seated myself a few feet away and it carefully trod forward. I panicked, realising I had discarded my broom and I had nothing to defend myself with if it decided it was hungry for human flesh. I leaned backwards, but the wagging tail and near delighted eyes of the wolf calmed my erratic heartbeat and I reached out a hand for the advancing animal. It sniffed my fingers curiously before unleashing its assault on my hand with a soft pink tongue. I giggled at the ticklish feeling and courageously raised my hand to pat the wolf's head.</p>
<p>"Aww, you're just a little princess, aren't you?" I whispered, all fear diminishing as I stroked the shockingly friendly animal behind the ears. Its eyes closed as it leant into my touch and I laughed when it collapsed to the ground and rested a heavy head in my lap. "You're like a giant puppy," I noted and it emitted a small whimpering noise in response.</p>
<p>I want it.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Honestly, this came out of the blue. I was discussing it with my friend and I didn't wanna use any of my other ideas, so I just decided to do something not so original in a totally unique way :P I'm just making stuff up as I go, so don't expect fast updates.
