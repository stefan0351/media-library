<P><B>so basically, in my ap english class, we're memorizing 35 lines from Hamlet. it's a grade. we have to recite it to our teacher before break starts on the 18th. so, the reason for me telling you this is that i'm lazy and i don't wanna do it so i wanted to complain about this to all of you :)</B></P><P><B>anyway, now that my babbling is done-ski, here comes your chapter 7! enjoy! :D</B></P><P>So, things between Lilly and I have been frozen, literally. She's been giving me the cold shoulder, probably for what happened at lunch that day. Of course, Oliver joined in her freeze-out. And me? I've been gladly accepting the freeze-out for some time to think...</P><P>I have not repeated those two words I said to myself that day this entire time. I refuse to accept this. I am a chick who likes dick. I don't do the lesbian thing. April and Amanda tried that once, it wasn't for them, so they tossed it off. Besides, it's all a choice. I could choose to be...gay...or I could choose to be straight like I want to. April and Amanda decided that it didn't work for them, so I'm going to do the same. I don't see any reason why I have to give in to these "demonic urges," as I'm sure my dad would call them.</P><P>Although, this has made sharing a room awkward. Especially since we had actually started to...insert shudder here...bond. Just when we'd actually begun to get along, insert shock here, we'd fallen apart. That's how it happens, I guess.</P><P>I'd basically been walking to school every day, too, which sucked. I've been trying to hitch hike, but no one wants to pick up a girl in black parachute pants, combat boots, a corsette, and fishnet. Especially one with pink streaks in her already died dark brown hair.</P><P>When the alarm goes off, I hit the button almost immediately, since I'd already been lying awake in bed. I groggily ran a hand down my face, then sit up, looking around. I notice the split second that I allowed the alarm to sound was not enough time to wake Lilly up. The annoying laugh of the little peanut that runs the food shop on the beach entered my head. I was going to have fun with this.</P><P>I gently rolled out of bed, careful not to disturb her, and headed towards the bathroom connected to our bedroom where she dyed my hair. I quietly grabbed a cup from the sink, filled it with water, and tip-toed back to the room. I strolled around to her side of the bed and splashed the water out of the cup on her face. She immediately came to.</P><P>"MILEY!"</P><P>"We're gonna be late if you don't get up now."</P><P>"BITCH!" She screamed, throwing back the covers and jumping out of the bed at me. "I've dealt with your shit long enough! Your dumbass fucking bitchy attitude is ridiculous! Cut the crap, Miley, you don't have anyone fooled. We all know you're an insecure, hurting, little girl that's just scared, and no one's impressed with how badass you can be. So just quit playing bitch and get over it." Her tone was so harsh it shocked me. I'd never heard her so angry in all the time that I'd known her-(which, granted, wasn't very long, but still).</P><P>"Fine," I managed, grabbing some clothes that were just lying on the floor and escaping into the bathroom. There was no way in hell she was going to see me cry. I don't cry; ever. Yet, suddenly, with a few mean words, I was in tears. What was happening to me?</P><P>"Ah, shit, Miley, I'm sorry." I heard her footsteps pad across the room before she knocked, trying to be let in. "Come on, let me in. Let's talk about it. I didn't mean to say that."</P><P>"You wouldn't have said it if you didn't mean it so it doesn't matter whether you meant to say it anyway." I hoped that she couldn't hear the tears in my voice.</P><P>"Are you <I>crying?</I>" Ah, shit. I didn't reply. "I didn't know you <I>cry.</I>"</P><P>I ripped open the door. "You say that like I'm some monster with no heart."</P><P>She didn't say anything, just looked blankly into my face.</P><P>"Oh, thanks." I closed the door again.</P><P>"Come on, Miley. You know it's true. You stalk around screaming, 'Fuck you,' to anyone who tries to be remotely close to you. You have like, what, 4 friends? What the hell happened to you to make you so closed off?"</P><P>No. No way was I going there. "Nothing," I mumbled through the door, "just let me get dressed in peace."</P><P>"Miley-"</P><P>"Just go."</P><P>Lilly paused, then sighed. "Fine." I heard her footsteps grow faint.</P><P>...</P><P>Lilly forced me to let her give me a ride to school this morning. When Oliver came out (ha-ha) of his house, headed for the car, and saw me in the passenger seat, he just about had a heart attack. He looked extremely confused, then continued on his way to the car and obilgingly sat in the back seat.</P><P>"So, uhh...are we done with the arcticness now?" he asked tentatively.</P><P>Lilly sighed, then said, "I'll tell you about it later, Olliepop."</P><P>"Lilly, you know that no one is allowed to call me that. Ever."</P><P>"Come on, it's not like it depletes your manliness."</P><P>"What manliness?"</P><P>"Exactly."</P><P>Their exchanges were funny, at times, so I'd grown accustomed to listening to them. Althought I'm not quite sure were Lilly and I stood on the whole fighting/not-fighting front, I decided to just let it drop for now. Yes, I was extremely pissed that she acted like she knew me better than anyone on the whole fucking planet, but when people brought up my past I tended to sweep it under a rug and pretend it's not there. Insert elephant in the room here.</P><P>Besides, I had bigger things to worry about. Things that Oliver might be able to help me with, if perhaps, I was actually admitting to myself that this could be real.</P><P>"Um...Oliver...I have a question to ask you," I started.</P><P>The confusion and hesitation were evident in his tone. "Yes?"</P><P>Well, I figured I was too far gone to turn back now. "How did you know you were gay?"</P><P>Lilly's eyebrows shot up and Oliver let out a nervous chuckle. "What?"</P><P>"You heard what I said."</P><P>"Why are you asking me this?"</P><P>"Just answer the question, would you, Olliepop?"</P><P>"Damn it! Thanks a lot, Lilly." Her facial expression didn't change at his sarcastic remark. She still looked astounded.</P><P>"If you don't relax your face it's gonna freeze like that," I told her. She let her eyebrows fall, but the shock was still flooding her facial features.</P><P>"Well," Oliver began, "it's not like I just woke up one day and said, 'Hey, I'm gay.' I thought about it for a long time and really over-analyzed the whole situation. But, for guys, as I'm sure you know, it's a bit hard to hide when we're turned on. The evidence in the locker room showers spoke for itself."</P><P>"No way," I couldn't help but laugh, "You went hard in front of all the guys in the locker room?"</P><P>"Hey, shut up," Lilly snapped, "It's not like he could help it."</P><P>"Well, he could've ignored it. He could've chose to just not be gay."</P><P>Silence. I felt like I'd just inadvertantly offended an entire crowd of people, except there were only two. Finally, Oliver spoke up. "I didn't choose to be gay, Miley. I didn't just wake up one day and decide, 'Hey, I'm going to wear those shoes, with that top, and be gay,' either. It doesn't work that way."</P><P>"Then how does it work?"</P><P>He sighed. Obviously, this was a lot harder to explain than I'd thought. "There's no way it 'works.' It just is. Just like the way you didn't choose to be straight, it's just the way you are. I was born with brown eyes, brown hair, olive skin and homosexuality." I wasn't going to say anything when he said I was straight.</P><P>"You're just born with it? Just like that?"</P><P>"Just like that."</P><P>...</P><P>The second we were all out of the car and heading towards the school building, Oliver pulled me back, letting Lilly drift ahead. "What was that?"</P><P>"You've got to stop asking me that."</P><P>"I'm serious! Are you...Are you gay?"</P><P>"No!" I quickly shouted, maybe a little too loud. A few heads turned, including Lilly's.</P><P>"Hey, are you guys coming?" she asked.</P><P>"Yeah, be right there," Oliver called to her. It seemed to placate her and she turned back around, continuing towards school. He proceeded. "A little over-exaggerated denial, don't you think?"</P><P>"No, I don't. It's just right. Because I'm not gay. I'm not. I am <I>not </I>gay."</P><P>"Miley, it's okay if you are. Look at who you're talking to."</P><P>"But, I'm not. I'm not gay."</P><P>He studied me hard. "Who are you trying to convince? Me, or you?"</P><P>...</P><P>Later, at lunch, I noticed that Lilly was missing. "Where's Lilly?" I asked Olliepop.</P><P>"Probably swapping spit with Melissa under a stairwell somewhere," he mumbled.</P><P>"Wait, what?" I asked, dropping my fork.</P><P>His eyes grew wide and he clamped a hand over his mouth. "Shit! I can't keep secrets worth a damn!"</P><P>"You mean Melissa London?"<P>"No, I don't mean anybody! Shut up!"</P><P>"I thought Lilly was straight."</P><P>"Shut up! Shut up shut up shut up shut up <I>shut up</I>!"</P><P>"Oliver, come on. Just tell me."</P><P>"No! I'm not supposed to!"</P><P>"We're a little past that, don't you think?"</P><P>"Shut up! Just shut up!"</P><P>"Why do you keep telling me to shut up like she's listening or something?"</P><P>"Because I am," Lilly spat, coming out of fucking nowhere and sitting down. "Oliver! What the fuck is wrong with you?" I've never heard Lilly use as many cuss words the whole time I've known her-again, not long-as I have today.</P><P>"I'm sorry! It was an accident!"</P><P>"Some friend you are."</P><P>"Why wasn't I supposed to know?" I interjected.</P><P>She sighed. "Because I thought you might be all weird and awkward with us sharing a room, and a bed."</P><P>"Pft, like I'd care."</P><P>"Would you?"</P><P>"Duh. Of course not. It doesn't matter if your straight gay bi or asexual, I still don't wanna have to share a room and bed with you."</P><P>She rolled her eyes. "There's the Miley we all know and love."</P><P>"You act like we've known each other all our lives."</P><P>"So?"</P><P>"We barely know each other. I met you both, what, a month ago?"</P><P>"Yeah, well, when you're shunned by a good percent of the population, you start to be very grateful for the friends you actually do have."</P><P>No one said anything after that. I guess that might be true. Whatever. I was still harping on this whole gay mess.</P><P>She's gay, he's gay, I'm gay, we're all gay.</P><P><B>so this is where the chapter ends. rave if you love it, rant if you hate it. either way, it would be pretty rad if you hit that review button as seen below :)</B></P>
