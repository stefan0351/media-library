<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 4 -->

<p>They left town early the next morning in search of the next county tournament.  B'Elanna was having tremendous success with these small competitions and slowly but surely there were increasing their supply of currency.  After every tournament they would eat their fill at the banquet and leave for the next town.  Harry would sell whatever prizes B'Elanna had been awarded and enter her in the next set of games.  They gradually added mounted sword fighting to the events she entered.  They had tried archery but unlike Harry she lacked a talent for the sport.  They were careful to guard their savings and almost always chose to camp outside of town and hunt for their food rather than stay at the local inns.  Once in a while however they would agree to a night at an inn with a bath and a well-prepared meal as a reward for their restraint.  On these nights B'Elanna would often gamble with the other nobles staying at the inn, and more often than not she would win back the cost of the rooms from her companions.</p>
<p>As she continued to win tournaments they found that Lord Beyla's reputation as a fighter began to proceed them from town to town.  She was often the first to be chosen for sides in the melee rounds and whenever she rode onto the tournament grounds a flock of young women would gather to try to give her tokens to wear on her armour as a display of their favour for the handsome young knight.  At first B'Elanna was uncomfortable with all of the attention paid to her by the locals, but she gradually began to relax as her accent improved under Harry's tutelage.  She even began to enjoy the flirtatious young woman who competed for her favour, often accepting a handkerchief or nosegay of flowers from a pretty maid to wear as she battled on the field of honour.</p>
<p>Harry was enjoying his role as herald and valet to B'Elanna.  Their friendship had grown strong over time and he truly admired her ability to rise to every occasion.  He never forgot that she was the one who saved his life, and that she had committed murder on his behalf.  He had never met someone with such purpose of mind.  B'Elanna rose before dawn on every day save the days she was to fight in tournament and spent the predawn hours lifting heavy objects and running through the woods in an obviously successful attempt to increase her stamina and strength.  He didn't even object when she insisted on carrying him pick-a-back at a full run through the woods for an hour.</p>
<p>After her exercises as she liked to call them they would practice with the blade for several more hours.  Harry was no match for her but his skills improved over time as they fought daily.  B'Elanna was breathtaking to watch as she moved with a cat-like grace.  She had an unerring ability to read her opponent and to anticipate his move seemingly before he even knew he was going to make it.  After several months of this lifestyle her body was rippling with muscles and she could leap in full armour to the back of her horse with ease.  Harry could see why all the young ladies swooned over Lord Beyla.  As for himself he loved B'Elanna with the steadfast love of one friend for another.  He would never abandon or betray her and he trusted her with his life.  He had become accustomed to seeing her without clothes as he dressed her and rubbed her aching muscles at night, but there was not a flicker of passion between them.  He suspected that her willingness to engage in harmless flirtation with the local gentry's daughters was about something more than appearances, but he kept his own council on that score.</p>
<p>They were riding toward yet another in a seemingly endless round of backwater tournaments when Harry finally voiced a thought that had been worrying at him for some time now.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna," he asked, breaking her out of her reverie.</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied, knowing from his tone of voice that he had something important to talk about.</p>
<p>"I've been thinking.  I believe that you are ready to participate in the larger tournaments.  We are making money here in the counties, but it will take a lifetime of this to amass any wealth to speak of."</p>
<p>"But I don't have any papers as yet, and you said they would be required for the larger tournaments."</p>
<p>"I know, and that is partly what I've been thinking about.  I believe we should go to France for your first big tournament.  We can have your papers forged there, that way there will be no one in England who can dispute your claim. We have more than enough money for our passage and to get your papers, and with all the English soldiers still stationed in France there are sure to be any number of rich tournaments to choose from."</p>
<p>B'Elanna's eyes grew wide at the thought of leaving England.  Such notions were outrageous for a peasant girl such as herself, and yet, she was no longer that girl.  She was Lord Beyla now, and as nervous as she was at the prospect she knew Harry would never offer her ill council and so she agreed to his plan.</p>
<p>It was a week's hard ride to Dover where they booked passage to Calais.  Although English was widely spoken in France since her defeat at the hands of England, Harry coached B'Elanna on enough French to allow her get by during the short time they would spend in the foreign land.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had never seen the ocean before and as they rode along the tops of the cliffs she was awestruck at the sight of such a vast expanse of water and nothingness.  She reveled in the smell of the salt air and almost forgot to be nervous about their latest undertaking as she took in all of the new experiences around her.</p>
<p>The 21-mile trip over the channel to France was memorable to B'Elanna.  She had never before been on a boat, and now here she was standing at the bow of this huge sailing vessel as it crashed through the stormy seas on its way to a new land.  Harry was feeling a little queasy and had opted to stay below decks.  B'Elanna, for her part, didn't want to miss a moment of this adventure; she stood upright, her body swaying to the rhythm of the ocean, enjoying the sting of salt water on her face.  She had never felt more alive!</p>
<p>When they landed in Calais B'Elanna was sorry to be leaving the ship; she had enjoyed the feeling of freedom that came with being at sea. Harry on the other hand was delighted to be back on Terra Firma and it was all he could do not to bend down and kiss the ground as they walked down the gangplank.  It took several hours for their horses and gear to be unloaded, and during that time Harry made several inquiries as to where they might find lodging and a scrivener.  So it was that when their mounts were ready he already had a destination in mind, and he led the way as they rode away from the docks.</p>
<p>Once again it was up to Harry to do all of the talking, as his French was flawless from years of study. They obtained a room, a bath and a meal in short order and opted to remain in their room this evening and lay their plans for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>"I have the name of several scriveners in the area of the docks.  Apparently there's quite a trade in forged papers now that France has lost the war with England.  I don't think I'll have too much trouble getting you proof of nobility within a few days," Harry explained as they relaxed on their beds.</p>
<p>"Once we have the papers we should find a tournament in the area and get to work," B'Elanna replied, her mind as ever focussed on her task.</p>
<p>"I'll make some inquiries when I'm at the Clark's shop tomorrow.  It shouldn't be too hard I would imagine."</p>
<p>"Do you really think I'm ready for a bigger tournament Harry.  Perhaps we should attend a few more smaller ones before I make the attempt."</p>
<p>"You are ready B'Elanna, I'm certain of it.  You're one of the best fighters I've ever seen, and you've never been stronger.  You have no reason to fear; I think if we delay much longer your fears will get the better of you and you'll never be able to commit to the endeavour."</p>
<p>"You're right as ever Harry.  Get me the papers and we'll head for the nearest tournament."</p>
<p>Having made their agreement they lay down to sleep.  For a change it was Harry who was up before dawn, and he left a brief note for B'Elanna as he went into the city in search of forged papers.  He had success in the first shop he entered and after a little bargaining he managed to secure proof of nobility going back for several generations for Lord Beyla.  In addition he agreed to allow the scrivener to produce a standard with Lord Beyla's family crest upon it for him to carry as they entered the larger tournament grounds in parade formation as was customary.  He settled on a rampant stag and lion on a field of scarlet.  It was similar to his own family's coat of arms, but different enough not to arouse suspicion.  He paid the artist half of the fee up front and agreed to return in two days time to collect the papers and pay the balance.</p>
<p>For the next two days the young friends wandered throughout the city, enjoying the sights and smells of the foreign land.  They had heard of two major tournaments in the area, one at Rouen and the other at Amiens and they had agreed to enter both of them as soon as the papers were in hand.  B'Elanna was now excited at the prospect of her first major test and found ways to continue her fitness regime even in the city.  They attended the marketplace and purchased a new set of clothes for both of them as the banquets attendant to these tournaments would be much grander than anything they had seen up until now.</p>
<p>With papers finally in hand they set out for Rouen, once again camping in the woods as they traveled.  The night before they were to enter the city of Rouen, they were sitting by their campfire eating the woodcock Harry had brought down with his bow when he raised a painful subject.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I think its time you faced the obvious."</p>
<p>"No Harry I've told you a hundred times, I won't do it."</p>
<p>"You have to B'Elanna, it's expected of you.  You don't want to raise suspicions do you?"</p>
<p>"No one will notice if I don't do it."</p>
<p>"Yes they will.  The nobility are bored by life in general.  They will attempt to make a mystery out of anything even slightly out of the ordinary.  If you don't do it they're sure to talk.  We don't want to draw any unnecessary attention to ourselves do we?  Trust me?..you can do this; I'll teach you.  Who knows it may even be fun."</p>
<p>"There is nothing fun about dancing," B'Elanna stated petulantly.</p>
<p>Harry wouldn't give up however and eventually B'Elanna capitulated and they joined hands by the fire as Harry tried to teach the fine art of dancing to his friend.  He roared with laughter as she stumbled over the simplest of steps.  He could not for the life of him understand how someone so graceful in battle could be so clumsy at dance.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should try this with your armour on and we'll have more luck," he gasped through his laughter.</p>
<p>"Keep it up and you'll find yourself in a great deal of pain Harry," B'Elanna mocked.</p>
<p>"Nothing could pain me more than the sight of your Quadran Pavan," Harry teased even as he extended his hand to begin the lesson again.  "Think of it as fighting, but without the swords," he advised.  Oddly this seemed to work and B'Elanna eventually managed to string most of the steps together without stumbling too badly.</p>
<p>"You need to work on not looking like you're concentrating quite so hard, remember this is supposed to be fun."</p>
<p>"I said it before and I'll say it again?there's nothing fun about dancing," B'Elanna said through gritted teeth as she finished the steps Harry had taught her.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it eventually."</p>
<p>"If it doesn't kill one of us first," B'Elanna threatened comically.</p>
<p>"All right, I can take a hint, enough for tonight."</p>
<p>They lay down by the fire and talked quietly about what they could expect once they entered the tournament grounds the next day.  Although they were both nervous and excited it was not long before they were fast asleep.</p>
