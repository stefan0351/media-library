<!-- Becoming One \ Part 4: Learning and Controlling -->

<p>"Something's troubling you, child." </P>
<p>Willow opened her eyes to see a woman in a flowing blue robe standing over her. It was obvious from the look of her, and the wrinkles that lined her face and hands, that she was older, but there was an apparent youthfulness in her features. </P>
<P>Her white hair peeked out from underneath the hood she wore over her head. Her eyes matched the color of her robe, and held a look of purity so strong, that Willow had to adjust her vision to look at the woman. </P>
<p>Willow looked over at Buffy who lay still, sleeping quietly.</P>
<p>"Come."</P>
<p>"Is this a dream?"</P>
<p>"In certain respects. I have things to tell you."</P>
<p>Willow got up and followed the woman out of the dorm, but instead of coming into the hallway, they entered a field. A garden actually. Flowers and plants of various shapes, colors and sizes lined the sides of a path. At the end of it, they sat under a large tree.</P>
<p>"Do you know what this tree is?"</P>
<p>"It's a Willow tree."</P>
<p>The woman smiled. "Very good. It's your namesake."</P>
<p>"It's a Weeping Willow." She frowned.</P>
<p>"Do not let the name give you the wrong impression. Its drooping branches protect whatever is under it, whatever it is close to. As you do."</P>
<p>"Who are you?"</P>
<p>"A person who has been around a good long while, and I see a fellow practitioner in need. Someone who is destined for something great. I have come to offer guidance."</P>
<p>"You're a Wicca?"</P>
<p>"One of the first. And you are a special child of the art, Willow."</P>
<p>"Me? But I'm not a real wicca. Real wiccas are born with…"</P>
<p>"You were born with it. Don't you see? You're named after one of nature's children. Nature is the very foundation of our gift. It was not an accident that you started to explore magick. It was already decided."</P>
<p>"By who?"</P>
<p>"Fate. The force that guides us all. You are its chosen."</P>
<p>"No, you have the wrong girl. Buffy's the one you want."</P>
<p>"We are all chosen for different things."</P>
<p>"But, I'm just regular and…"</P>
<p>"You are far from it, my dear. When you performed the Soul Restoration ritual, one of the most potent and powerful magicks in existence, there was no doubt that you were the one it wanted."</P>
<p>"Anyone could have done that, I just…"</P>
<p>"Any other person would have died. Virtually no one could survive channeling such a strong force at such an undeveloped stage. But you did. You will come to see how special you really are. How vital to the cause and to the Slayer you are."</P>
<p>"Does this have to do with us?"</P>
<p>"Most certainly. Your love and friendship is a powerful force. You are connected. Almost completely." </P>
<P>Willow was perplexed. </P>
<P>"I've said too much. More will be revealed, but you have a challenge to overcome first. And as bad as things might get, it must occur.  Just know that no matter what happens, you must allow her in."</P>
<p>"What do you mean?"</P>
<p>"Later, child. For now, learn. Strengthen. We will speak again. Take care."</P>
<p>Willow woke, and sunlight shined through the window of the dorm. Buffy was watching her. She made a move to get up, and Buffy reached for her.</P>
<p>"Where are you going?" She asked. </P>
<p>She wanted to tell her about the dream, the woman. But she had a feeling it was something that she was supposed to keep to herself. She smiled.&#9;</P>
<P>"Nowhere." </P>
<p>She fell back into Buffy's arms. Today was Saturday. Today they were going to learn how to control their telepathic abilities.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>A few hours later they walked off campus, and into Breaker's Woods. Giles said that's where he wanted to meet.</P>
<p>"Are you sure you know where you're going?" Buffy asked Willow.</P>
<p>"Yes. The clearing is just up here. Come on."</P>
<p>Walking a few more minutes, they got to the clearing. It was rather large, filled with beautiful flowers, and contained a tree Willow recognized immediately. She walked over to it, and just kind of gazed. </P>
<p><I>'D&eacute;j&agrave; vu?'</P>
</I><p>"What D&eacute;j&agrave; vu?" Buffy asked. There was no reason not to let her know, so she focused all her thoughts on it, so Buffy could see. "That's…who do you think she is?"</P>
<p>"I don't know. It seemed pretty real though. I just remember this tree. It's my namesake. That's what she said."</P>
<p>"I'm still stuck on the last part. You're supposed to let me in somewhere?"</P>
<p>Willow shrugged, and went over to the tree. "Can you feel it? Close your eyes."</P>
<p>Buffy did, and they both stood there in silence, feeling the energy of the place flow through them. It felt safe here. Completely safe. </P>
<p><I>'Nature is full of positive energy, Willow. Buffy. Let it protect you.'  </I>It was the woman from the dream. <I>'You have come here to learn to control your mind connection. It is a simple task, but for now, to severe your link, it must be mutual.'</P>
<p>'What do you mean?' They said in unison.</P>
<p>'To break the connection you can do it individually and together, but since you are both starting out, it will be easier for your first time to do it together. You can activate it again at any time. Try.'</P>
<p></I>They felt the woman's voice leave their heads, and focused on each other. Together, they thought to break their telepathic link, and they both collapsed, succeeding. The loss of the connection was sudden and upsetting. They weren't expecting it. It was like a part of them had been taken away.</P>
<p><I>'The first time a link is broken, it is hard and shocking, but it will be easier next time. As you get stronger, you will not have to rely on the other person to break the link with you. </P>
<P>'But now, you must listen carefully. Angelus will use your abilities against you if you are connected. If you are hurt in any way, and you're connected, the pain in your minds will be extremely unpleasant. You must know when to use the link to your benefit. Good luck to you.'</P>
<p></I>The woman was gone now, and they scrambled over to one another, and embraced. They didn't let go. They needed closeness.</P>
<p>"We know how to do this now, right?" Buffy asked. Willow nodded. "So we can connect again?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded again. They closed their eyes and a second later, were linked again.</P>
<p>"That's better." Willow said.</P>
<p>"I can deal with not having you with me if I have to, but since I don't right now…"</P>
<p>"I know." Willow smiled at her, and looked around. "This is a Wiccan practicing spot."<I> </P>
</I><p>"That's what all this energy," Buffy waved her arm in the air, "is?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. Which explains why she was able to communicate so easily with us being awake."</P>
<p>"You get the feeling there's something bigger going on than we realize?"</P>
<p>"Oh yeah."</P>
<p>Giles came walking into the clearing carrying a basket.</P>
<p>"You're early." He said.</P>
<p>"Actually, you're late." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"So late that we already know how to work the telepathy thing." Willow added.</P>
<p>"How -"</P>
<p>Buffy shot over to the basket. "Is that lunch?"</P>
<p>"Yes, but -"</P>
<p>They started rummaging through the basket.</P>
<p>"Martha Steward would be proud Giles." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Could you please explain?"</P>
<p>"Sure thing, Giles. We're just kinda hungry."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the mansion, Angelus walked up to a woman who was chained to the wall. She was clearly frightened. Most of all, she was tired. He hadn't even gotten started yet.</P>
<p>"It's been a long time since I've tortured a woman. I don't want to kill you too fast, but I do want you to feel pain. The thing about torture is, it's gotta last for you to get the full effect."</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<p>"Practice. I've got two special girls in mind and I really want to give it my all for them. Give them the slowest and most painful experience possible." He picked up a hot poker that was still pulsing orange, and extremely hot. "You're number twelve. Let's see if you can last longer than number eleven. And if you don't try…"</P>
<p>He looked over at the fireplace, where bodies where burning, and their stench was filling the air. "Well, did you ever wonder what it was like to be burned alive?"</P>
<P>She screamed.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, at night, Buffy and Willow were patrolling.</P>
<p>"Giles is going into full research mode on that woman." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"He needs a challenge once and awhile. Are you sure you're going the right way?"</P>
<p>"Most of the recent deaths have been along this way."</P>
<p>"Aren't we getting close to the mansion?"</P>
<p>Buffy stopped immediately, and smacked herself on the head. </P>
<p>"Could I be a bigger idiot? Why wouldn't he be at the mansion? Let's go."</P>
<p>"Wait. Maybe we should go back and tell everyone."</P>
<p>"And let him kill more girls?"</P>
<p>Angelus walked out of the shadows from behind a tree. "Pretty please?"</P>
<p>Buffy immediately went to attack him. She connected with a shot to the legs, making him buckle, but he grabbed her and pulled her down too. They both got back up, and she tried to roundhouse into his head, but he caught her leg, and threw her down to the ground. He got over her, and she kicked her leg up, making him roll past her, and she got over him. She pulled out her stake. </P>
<P>What she didn't see, was the group of vampires gathering around Willow. They grabbed her. Buffy whirled around.</P>
<p>"You wouldn't want anything to happen to her, would you?" He asked, pushing her off, getting up and grabbing her throat.</P>
<p>"Let her go…I'm the one…you want."</P>
<p>"Giving yourself to me, lover?" He smirked. "Actually, you get to come along too."</P>
<p>He dropped her, and she ran to attack the vampires holding Willow. More appeared. She fought anyway. For each vampire she kicked, punched, or threw out of the way, another one stood in its place. She was no closer to Willow then when she started. Her mind was focused, and for awhile, she fooled herself into thinking she had the upper hand.</P>
<p>But Willow was still firmly in their grasp, and she didn't want to risk her dying. She didn't know what Angelus had planned, and as much as she didn't want to, she had to go along. Play it smart.</P>
<p>"You're outnumbered. Now either you can walk away, and Willow will die alone, or you can come with her and die together. Makes no difference to me."</P>
<p><I>'We'll get through this, Will.'</P>
<p>'Don't Buffy. Go.'</P>
<p></I>"Be gentle with them boys. We have a long night ahead."</P>
<p>Making sure they didn't see, Buffy ripped a piece of her sleeve, and threw it to the ground. Hopefully the guys would see it.  </P>
<P>This was going to be bad. They knew it.</P>
