<p>Enjoy</p>
<p>Lilly woke to a heavy weight against her stomach. She glanced down and met the huge, green eyes of a cat. A purring cat. A large, orange purring cat.</p>
<p>"You must be Garfield," she whispered.</p>
<p>She turned her head, finding Miley asleep next to her, her face resting against Lilly's shoulder. She closed her eyes for a second, then opened them again. Miley was absolutely beautiful. She looked so peaceful, so… sated. Lilly smiled. She should be. They had made love for hours. Lilly closed her eyes again. Hours. She had just spent hours in a stranger's arms… making love. And it was the most wonderful thing she had ever experienced. But now what?</p>
<p>She panicked. She had to leave. She had to get out before Miley woke up. She would want to talk and Lilly absolutely did not want to talk about it. She had spent hours making love to a woman she'd met in a bar. A woman who was seeing someone else.</p>
<p><i>Have you lost your mind? Oh, now is a fine time to come to your senses! </i></p>
<p>She quietly moved away from Miley. That was the easy part. The fat cat refused to budge.</p>
<p>"Get off," she hissed. The cat only stared at her.</p>
<p>Miley rolled over, clutching the pillow to her body. Then she opened her eyes, finding the bed empty. Well, there was Garfield. He was staring at her.</p>
<p>"Where'd she go?" Miley glanced at the clock. It was after five. "Jesus!" She jumped out of bed and walked into the living room, then the kitchen. "No note, Garfield. Imagine that," she murmured.</p>
<p>No, she knew Lilly wouldn't leave a note. What would she say? Thanks for a good time? Miley shook her head. It was too fast. She knew that this morning when she'd brought Lilly to her apartment. She never intended to end up in bed today. She just wanted breakfast and conversation. A chance to get to know her better. But, God, those eyes. Miley just couldn't resist those eyes.</p>
<p>And what they had just shared, it was more than Miley ever dreamed she was capable of. Lilly's mouth and hands drove her over the edge again and again. And Miley knew one day would never be enough.</p>
<p>Lilly drove aimlessly through the city. She couldn't seem to focus. She wasn't even sure where she was. One thing she was sure of. She was starving. She pulled into a fast food place and ordered a cheeseburger. As she sat there waiting, she stared at her hands. Then, without thinking, she brought them to her face, inhaling the scent of Miley that still clung to them.</p>
<p>"Oh God," she moaned. She shoved them quickly between her legs. It was a mistake. She clamped her thighs tightly around them, her body again remembering the way Miley had taken her, the feel of her mouth as it moved down her body, her tongue sliding through her wetness, bringing her to yet another orgasm.</p>
<p>For the first time in years, Lilly arrived early at the office. She had spent a restless Sunday, avoiding calls from Mikayla, avoiding her thoughts as they kept fumbling through her mind. She had been exhausted Saturday night. She had fallen into bed early, her body still sated. Her dreams were full of Miley but at least she slept. And Sunday morning, her body protested as she stood. Her muscles were sore, her body ached. And why not? It wasn't like she was used to making love for half a day.</p>
<p>"No, no, no," she whispered. She didn't want to think about it. So she'd met a stranger and slept with her? It wasn't like she was the first one to ever do that. It was just so totally out of character for her. And today she would have to face Mikayla and her questions. Well, one thing was for certain. She would never tell Mikayla what had happened. Breakfast, a little talking, that was all Mikayla needed to know.</p>
<p>But it was barely nine when her secretary, Jean, stuck her head in the door. "Something came for you," she said with a huge smile.</p>
<p>Lilly looked up and frowned. "What?"</p>
<p>The door opened wide and Jean walked in carrying a huge vase of long-stemmed roses. Lilly dropped her file on the floor and stared. <i>Oh my God. I'll kill her</i>.</p>
<p>"Actually, there's another one," Jean said. She came back with an identical vase as the first, setting both on top of Lilly's cluttered desk. Lilly moved her eyes from the beautiful roses back to her secretary, who stood expectantly, waiting for an explanation. Lilly had never received flowers before.</p>
<p>"There was no card," Jean said. "But, I assume you know who they're from," she teased.</p>
<p>Before Lilly could speak, her office starting filling. Five women stood around, oohing and ahhing over the flowers. Yes, she would definitely kill her.</p>
<p>"Oh my God!" Lilly closed her eyes. Mikayla. "Lilly? Who are they from?" she asked as she bent to sniff one of the flowers. "They're fabulous."</p>
<p>Lilly searched her muddled brain, trying to find the name of a client she could toss out, something to appease the other women, but none would come. "You must have had a nice weekend," one of the other attorneys said with a wink.</p>
<p>"I'll say. Two dozen? My, my."</p>
<p>"And long-stemmed. They're gorgeous."</p>
<p>"Who the hell are they from?" Mikayla asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, there was no card," Lilly said weakly.</p>
<p>"And you have no idea?"</p>
<p>Lilly stared. "Well, I may have an idea," she admitted. Her eyes went back to the flowers. She wanted to be angry with Miley, but God, they were beautiful. She let a small smile escape as she looked from one vase to the other. <i>Two</i> dozen? What had the woman been thinking?</p>
<p>The other women finally left, leaving only Mikayla standing with her hands on her hips. Lilly looked up and met her eyes, failing to stop the blush that crept up her face.</p>
<p>"Oh my God," Mikayla whispered. "You <i>slept</i> with her?"</p>
<p>Lilly took a deep breath, then turned to stare out the window. "Yes, I slept with her," she murmured. "I know. I'm absolutely insane."</p>
<p>"You didn't have to go <i>that </i>far," Mikayla said. "I just wanted you to pretend to like her. To go out to dinner or something, anything to get her away from Joannie. I didn't mean for you to actually have sex with her."</p>
<p>Lilly turned around and faced Mikayla. She couldn't believe that Mikayla thought she'd slept with Miley simply as a game, a ploy to deflect her interest away from Joannie. It wasn't like she could control it. Her body had simply taken over her mind. She had offered no resistance. It was at that very moment that Lilly realized that she had not spent half a day having sex with a stranger. She and Miley had made love. Their touches, their kisses were gentle, loving. Their whispered words were all about pleasure, emotional as well as physical. Not just sex.</p>
<p><i>Oh, dear God</i>. You <i>have</i> lost your mind.</p>
<p>"Are you not going to tell me what happened?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. What was to tell? They hadn't even made it through breakfast. "It just happened," she said weakly.</p>
<p>"And what about Joannie?"</p>
<p>"What about her? We didn't actually talk about her," Lilly admitted. "Although she indicated that it wasn't serious."</p>
<p>"Well I guess not. Not if she takes you to bed at the drop of a hat."</p>
<p>Lilly wanted to say it wasn't like that. But it was. They hadn't been at the table a half-hour before they had sped to Miley's apartment. She wanted to blame Miley but it was her suggestion, she knew. She was the one who couldn't control herself. She was the one who thought she would die right there at the table if she didn't get her hands on Miley.</p>
<p>A knock on the door saved Lilly from answering. "Mikayla, Mr. Calhoun needs you," Jean said. "And Lilly, call on line two. Ms. Stewart."</p>
<p>Lilly's heart fluttered at the mention of Miley's name. Thank goodness Mikayla didn't know her last name.</p>
<p>"We'll talk later," Mikayla said as she left. Lilly closed the door behind her, then moved slowly to her desk, her eyes watching the flashing light. She noticed her hand trembled as she reached for the phone.</p>
<p>"Lilly Truscott," she answered in her most professional voice.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you're wondering who they're from," Miley said.</p>
<p>"No, I had a pretty good idea," she said. "<i>Two</i>, Miley?"</p>
<p>"They have absolutely nothing to do with Saturday," she said.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. They're because of Sunday."</p>
<p>"Sunday?"</p>
<p>"Yes. They're to let you know how much I missed you on Sunday. And how often I thought of you," she said quietly. Damn… what could she say to that? "Please say you're not angry," Miley coaxed.</p>
<p>"They're beautiful. How could I possibly be angry?"</p>
<p>There was a pause, then Lilly heard Miley sigh. "Why did you leave?"</p>
<p>Yes, why Lilly? Tell her you panicked. "I was… embarrassed," she admitted.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You know very well why. I hardly know you. In fact, I don't know you at all. And we spent the <i>entire </i>day in bed," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Then get to know me. Lilly, I didn't mean for that to happen. Honestly, I just wanted to have breakfast and visit. And maybe make plans for dinner or something. I never imagined it would turn out like it did. But, I couldn't… resist."</p>
<p>"It was my fault," Lilly said. "I'm the one…"</p>
<p>"No. I could have said no. But, Lilly, I feel something for you. When I look into your eyes, I'm just lost," Miley admitted.</p>
<p>"No. We can't do this. We met in a bar, for God's sake!"</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"And… I have rules," she said weakly.</p>
<p>"Pretend we met at breakfast."</p>
<p>"Well that's just great. Thirty minutes later, we're in bed."</p>
<p>"Yes. What does that say?"</p>
<p>"It says I'm insane," Lilly said. "I can't do this, Miley."</p>
<p>"But you did. And you enjoyed it as much as I did," Miley insisted.</p>
<p>"Yes, I can't deny that. But it was a one-time thing."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, but I don't do one-time things." Miley stated.</p>
<p>"Miley, please, let's just let this go. Please?"</p>
<p>"Why? What are you afraid of?"</p>
<p>Lilly closed her eyes. She was afraid she would fall in love with her, that's what she was afraid of. And then what? She would be like Mikayla. Always afraid Miley would go to the bar and find someone else and repeat this silly game of seduction. She groaned. God, she was pathetic.</p>
<p>So, she tried the reasonable approach. "Miley, you're seeing someone else. I'm not in the habit of dating women who are dating others. I'm certainly not in the habit of <i>sleeping</i> with women who are sleeping with others."</p>
<p>There was silence. She heard Miley sigh again. "I can explain about Joannie. I just can't right now. But you've got to believe me when I say we are <i>not </i>sleeping together."</p>
<p>Lilly closed her eyes again. She wanted to believe Miley, she really did. But would it make a difference? They were still dating. Still going out. Who's to say Miley and Joannie won't end up in bed together?</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she said.</p>
<p>"Lilly, please, let's get dinner this week. We can talk and maybe by then I'll be able to explain. Please?"</p>
<p>God, Lilly so wanted to accept. A nice, quiet dinner. A time to get to know each other better. But then, she knew, if they were alone, if she looked into Miley's eyes, she would be lost all over again. And she knew she could not resist her. Her body would take over and they would repeat Saturday and they would be right back where they are now.</p>
<p>"I can't," she said. It was the right decision, she knew. But it was so hard to make.</p>
<p>There was a pause. "Okay. I understand. Perhaps later, when I can completely explain…"</p>
<p>"Miley… "</p>
<p>"What if I promise you'll laugh about it?"</p>
<p>"I doubt I'll laugh," she said.</p>
<p>"Trust me. You'll laugh."</p>
<p>"Come on. It'll give us a chance to talk," Mikayla pleaded.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't want to talk. She had been avoiding Mikayla since Monday. She had managed to get the two vases of long-stemmed roses to her car and to her apartment without tipping them over. She didn't want them at her office where she would be forced to look at them all day. And where others would be able to comment. It was almost as if Mikayla had forgotten about them. But she hadn't, Lilly knew. Each time she'd entered Lilly's office, her eyes went to where the vases were not.</p>
<p>"Okay. Dinner. Fine," Lilly finally agreed. It wasn't like she had anything else to do. And, truthfully, she would be thankful to escape her apartment, where the two dozen roses haunted her every move.</p>
<p>"I'm thinking Mexican," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"Whatever."</p>
<p>"Don't get too excited now, Lils." Mikayla deadpanned.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I would love to have dinner with you," Lilly said slowly. "And Mexican sounds wonderful."</p>
<p>"Great. It's warm out. Let's go to Jorge's and fight for the patio. They have the best margaritas in town."</p>
<p>"Fine," Lilly agreed.</p>
<p>"We'll talk," Mikayla said again.</p>
<p>"Great."</p>
<p>Miley had just shoved a tortilla chip into her mouth when she saw Lilly and Mikayla walk up. She nearly choked. She watched as they went inside, praying that they wouldn't choose the patio. But of course, they did.</p>
<p>"Are you going to see her again?" Joannie asked. Miley stared at Joannie. Oh yeah, she was about to see her in a second or two.</p>
<p>"We haven't made plans," she said truthfully.</p>
<p>"Look, I know you think you feel something for her. Your warped view of love at first sight and all, which doesn't exist, by the way. But if you do see her again, I would appreciate it if you <i>never</i> told her about our little charade," Joannie said. "If it ever got back to Mikayla, I would never forgive you."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. And speaking of that, why again are we doing this?" Miley asked. She pulled her eyes away when she saw the patio door open and watched as Lillly and Mikayla walked in. They were seated only four tables away. The only saving grace was that Mikayla's back was to them. Lilly, however, locked gazes with her. She met the blue eyes without flinching.</p>
<p>"Because if Mikayla found out, she would think I was a complete idiot," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"You <i>are</i> a complete idiot," Miley said, finally pulling her eyes from Lilly. God, could this night get any worse? "And I'm going along with this. What does that say about me?"</p>
<p>"It says you're my friend," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"Right now, that means so much to me," Miley murmured as she shoved another chip into her mouth.</p>
<p>Lilly sat down, elbows on the table and buried her head in her hands.</p>
<p>"Oh dear God," she murmured.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked up and met Mikayla's questioning eyes.</p>
<p>"Nothing," she said. She lifted her head and forced a smile to her face. "But a margarita sounds wonderful. Doesn't it? Make mine a double."</p>
<p>A waiter materialized and Mikayla ordered one for each of them. Lilly flicked her gaze past Mikayla, landing on the beautiful face of Miley Stewart as she spoke with Joannie. Her date. Her <i>girlfriend,</i> probably. Lilly groaned inwardly. God, she couldn't stand to see them together. It was nearly ripping her heart out. And what if Mikayla saw them? God, there would be a scene. She lowered her eyes, playing with her napkin nervously.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you?" Mikayla asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing. I'm fine," she said.</p>
<p>"You're nervous as hell," Mikayla said. "Look, I didn't invite you to dinner to get all the sordid details of your… affair with that woman. I know that's what you think. So you slept with her? Big deal. I'm glad you had a… quickie," she said.</p>
<p>"Quickie?"</p>
<p>"Well, I mean, you met her at a bar. You know, your rules."</p>
<p>"I'm well aware of my rules," Lilly said dryly.</p>
<p>"But, at least you got flowers out of the deal."</p>
<p>Lilly stared at Mikayla. Said that way, it sounded so cheap, so… <i>cheap</i>. Yes, she got flowers. Was it a thank you for services rendered? Or was it like Miley had said? She missed her and she'd thought about her? She glanced over at Miley, who sat talking quietly with Joannie. It was for services rendered. God, and it was so very cheap.</p>
<p>Miley tried to focus on what Joannie was saying, but her eyes kept glancing to Lilly. She and Mikayla sat quietly, barely talking. Had Mikayla seen them? Had Lilly told her that she and Joannie were there? It was all so complicated. All she wanted to do was go to Lilly and tell her the truth. She must be thinking that she was here on a date with Joannie. What else could she think?</p>
<p>"So, are you going to see her again?" Joannie asked again.</p>
<p>Miley met her eyes. She answered truthfully. "Yes. I would like to. I really like her, Joannie."</p>
<p>"I believe you. I think you're crazy, but I believe you."</p>
<p>"She doesn't have to tell Mikayla," Miley said. "You and Mikayla could work it out on your own."</p>
<p>"She doesn't want me," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"If you think she doesn't want you, then why are you so concerned if she knows about me?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to be made to look the fool."</p>
<p>"This was <i>your</i> idea," Miley reminded her as she looked once again across the room.</p>
<p>"Who do you keep looking at?"</p>
<p>"Nobody. Nothing." Lilly had gotten up. She was walking away. Miley looked back at Joannie. "Listen, I'm going… to the little girls room," she said, rising.</p>
<p>"Fine. I'm going to order us another."</p>
<p>"Yes. Fine. Whatever," Miley murmured as she hurried away.</p>
<p>Lilly stood at the sink, staring into the mirror. She hated the way she was feeling. She hated that her heart ached. So Miley was here with Joannie? It shouldn't matter. It wasn't like she had any claims on the woman. So they slept together? A day of fun, and it was over. She met her eyes again in the mirror. She didn't want it to be over. One day was not nearly enough. But it was over. Miley was seeing someone. But, Jesus, in a city this size, you'd think they could go to dinner without running into each other.</p>
<p>She turned quickly when the door opened, her eyes colliding with Miley's. Dark, intense eyes stared into her own. Lilly swallowed, unable to pull her gaze away.</p>
<p>Miley walked slowly to her, only stopping when they were but a breath away. Lilly noticed the pulse that throbbed in Miley's neck and she remembered putting her lips there. Her heart pounded in her chest and she knew her body remembered it, too.</p>
<p>"I know what you're thinking," Miley said.</p>
<p>"I doubt it." Miley took her hand and pulled her into the handicapped stall, closing the door behind them.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Lilly asked.</p>
<p>"I want to kiss you. And I didn't think you'd want me to do it out there," Miley said quietly.</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, no, but she made no attempt to leave. "Please don't," she whispered. "I can't, Miley. I can't do this."</p>
<p>Miley ignored her protest, instead reaching for her and pulling her closer. Lilly offered no resistance as her arms slid up Miley's shoulders and around her neck. Nothing mattered. Not Joannie. Not Mikayla. Not even the fact that they were in a bathroom stall. Their mouths met, a wild hunger that controlled them both. Lilly's tongue found its way inside Miley's mouth and her hands held Miley tightly to her.</p>
<p>She gasped when Miley cupped her breasts and she pressed closer, molding herself to the other woman. Memories flooded her mind, thoughts of Miley's mouth on her, hands spreading her thighs apart, fingers entering her, bringing her to orgasm. Her hips bucked hard against Miley. She had lost control. If Miley wanted to make love to her right here, right now, she could offer no resistance.</p>
<p>They were both breathing hard when Miley finally pulled away. Their eyes met, then Miley lowered her head, kissing Lilly lightly, softly on the lips. Lilly moaned. Miley leaned her forehead against Lilly's and sighed.</p>
<p>"How can you do this to me? You make me crazy," Lilly murmured.</p>
<p>Miley took Lilly's hand and pressed her palm against Miley's chest. "And you make me crazy," she whispered.</p>
<p>Lilly felt the thundering heartbeat under her palm and her eyes slid shut. She moved her hand the few inches necessary to touch Miley's breast. She groaned. Did the woman ever wear a bra? She cupped her breast, her fingers moving lightly across it. Then she pulled away before she totally embarrassed herself. She was seconds away from lifting Miley's shirt and putting her mouth on her.</p>
<p>"I can't take this anymore, Lilly. We've got to talk."</p>
<p>Lilly raised confused eyes to Miley. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Please. Go out with me. Let's have dinner or something."</p>
<p>"No. You can't make a date with me when your other date is right out there." Lilly stepped away from Miley, running her fingers through her hair. She cursed her body for being so weak. It was like she was under some kind of spell. She seemed to lose complete control whenever she was within ten feet of this woman.</p>
<p>"She's not my date. Why won't you believe me?"</p>
<p>"Then explain what she is to you."</p>
<p>Miley hesitated. "You and Mikayla, you're good friends, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And you tell her practically everything?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much."</p>
<p>Miley nodded. Joannie would kill her. "That's why I can't tell you."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Miley gripped Lilly's arms. "Lilly, please trust me. Give me a little time to straighten this out."</p>
<p>"You mean, you want to get rid of her first? Then it's safe to be seen with me?"</p>
<p>"No. That's not what I mean." Miley stepped back, frustration getting the best of her. "This is so fucking crazy," she muttered.</p>
<p>"Why won't you tell me what is going on?"</p>
<p>"Because she'll kill me. Come on, we better get back. They'll wonder where we are."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded. No doubt Mikayla had seen Miley pass by their table. She would know. She would be furious.</p>
<p>Again, I think I got all the names but I'm not 100% sure. Tell me if I didn't. Thanks for reading!</p>
