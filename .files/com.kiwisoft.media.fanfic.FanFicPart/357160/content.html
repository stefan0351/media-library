<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 12: Going Back and Moving Forward - Part 1-->

<p>Her life was back to normal now. She was settling into routine once again. Things with Willow had settled, and they hadn’t heard from Faith for a week and a half. Which in her opinion was good. She didn’t want to have to deal with her just yet. Of course Faith’s lack of contact could also have meant she was planning something big to kill them all, but Buffy preferred to stay positive.</P>
<p>It was a regular patrol tonight. She was in the playground by the slide, and she heard a rustling in the bushes over to her right. Pulling out her stake, she decided to wait for whatever it was, to come to her. Just as she suspected, it was a vampire. It came running towards her.</P>
<p><I>‘I never thought I’d think this, but one vampire? Come on, where’s the challenge?’</P>
<p></I>She ran up the slide, and just as she had hoped, he followed her up. She kicked him in the chest. He rolled down the slide. She had hoped that she would be quick enough to run down and stake him before he got up, but unfortunately, he recovered quickly. <I>	</P>
</I><P>"Wow, that was really funny looking! Could you do it again?" Buffy said.</P>
<P>"I'll kill you for that."</P>
<P>"For that? What were you trying to kill me for before?"</P>
<P>The vampire swung at her, but she ducked it and came up behind him. He faced her just in time to take a roundhouse kick in the shoulder. He swung again, but she ducked it and punched him in the gut, then rose back up and backhanded him in the head. Then she shoved him back and followed up with a half-spinning wheel kick, making the vampire stumble back and fall onto the carousel. She strode toward him.</P>
<P>"Okay, so here's the deal." She said, raising her stake.</P>
<P>Just as she was about to end the fight, an unexpected wave of dizziness hit her. She closed her eyes and stepped back unsteadily, in pain. The vampire seized the opening and rushed her, grabbed her by the jacket, swung her around and threw her onto a picnic table. She rolled off of it and onto the ground. </P>
<P>The vampire jumped on top of her, and she turned her head away in fright. He grabbed her right wrist with one hand and with the other grabbed her hand and twisted it around, hurting her and making her cry out. He pointed her own stake at her chest, and the vampire used his weight to slowly push it down at her.</P>
<P>"Lemme know if I'm not doing this right."</P>
<I><P>‘What the hell is happening?’ </I>She thought as she tried to struggle against him. </P>
<P>Attempting to get him off her, she delivered a head-butt. He got stunned, stopped pushing on the stake, but was still on top of her. She slapped him hard in the face, and shoved him off. He rolled away, onto all fours. Buffy scrambled to get the stake, rolled back onto her back and braced the stake against her chest pointing upward. The vampire jumped to his feet and lunged for her, landing on top of her and impaling himself. He exploded into a cloud of ashes. </P>

<P>"It was like an instant headache." Buffy said to Willow later that night on the phone.</P>
<P>"Are you sick?"</P>
<P>"I don’t think so. This has never happened before. Ever."</P>
<P>"Maybe it was just a bad night."</P>
<P>"A bad night? I can’t afford that. The guy wasn’t even that smart. He was new, and he almost staked me." Buffy was frustrated.</P>
<P>"It’ll be okay. I didn’t mean to sound like I think that this is nothing or anything like that, but when you’re upset and angry, I’m supposed to be calm and soothing. And vice versa."</P>
<P>"And you’re doing a good job."</P>
<P>"I hope so. Before you get too freaked, just talk to Giles tomorrow. I bet after you sleep, it’ll be better."</P>
<P>"I’m sure it will too. Luv ya, Will. Night."</P>
<P>"Love you more." Willow said playfully. "Goodnight, Buffy."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy stood by the table in the library concentrating on a target she set up against the railing of the stack level. She raised a knife and threw it. It glanced off of the target and hit the floor. Giles came into the library with his briefcase and a cup of coffee and headed toward his office.</P>
<P>"Bit early in the day." He said. </P>
<P>"Giles, something's wrong."</P>
<P>"Wrong?"</P>
<P>He saw the target with a few knives stuck awkwardly into it. None of them were near the center.</P>
<P>"Ah. Perhaps you shouldn't, " He started as Buffy missed another throw, "do that anymore." He put down his briefcase, and took a sip of coffee.</P>
<P>"On top of that, I got a bad case of the dizzies last night and almost let a vamp stake me. With my own stake!"</P>
<P>She threw another knife that was completely off target. </P>
<P>"I'm way off my game. My game's left the country. It's in Cuernavaca. Giles, what's going on here?"</P>
<P>"Well, perhaps you've got a bad flu bug or something."</P>
<P>"No. No, not sick. I can't get sick. My dad's coming to take me to the ice show. We do it every year for my birthday. If I cancel, it's gonna break his heart."</P>
<P>"Well, just, take it easy for forty-eight hours. You know, forego patrolling until you feel yourself again."</P>
<P>She picked up a couple more knives from the table.</P>
<P>"No. No, I just need to spend a little more time training."</P>
<P>She threw one that hit a reading lamp. </P>
<P>"I'm gone!"</P>
<P>"Thank you."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"An ice show? A show performed on ice. And how old are we again?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>They were outside eating lunch.</P>
<P>"I went to Snoopy-On-Ice when I was little. My dad took me backstage, and I got so scared…I…threw up on Woodstock." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Look, I know you guys think it's just a big, dumb, girlie thing, but it's not. I mean, a lot of those skaters are Olympic medal winners. And every year my dad buys me cotton candy and one of those souvenir programs that has all the pictures, and okay, it's a big, dumb, girlie thing, but I love it."</P>
<P>Willow gave her an understanding smile. She knew how much the show and her dad meant to her.</P>
<P>"It's not so girlie. Ice is cool. It's water, but it's not." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Ixnay on the caramel corn, though, if you go backstage." Willow said.</P>
<P>Buffy nodded in agreement.</P>
<P>"We're still talking party, right? I mean, some of us still love to relish celebrating in the birth of the Buff." Xander said.</P>
<P>"I dunno. I think it might be time to put a moratorium on parties in my honor. They tend to go badly. Monsters crash. People die."</P>
<P>"But eighteen is a big one, Buffy. I mean, you can vote now. You can be drafted. You can vote not to be drafted. But I can understand why a quiet birthday would be good." Willow grinned.</P>
<P>"Naughty, Willow! You know, I think a little reflecting would do me good." Buffy said pulling Willow onto her lap.</P>
<P>"Where is it written that quiet reflection can't be combined with cake and funny hats?" Xander asked, not picking up on anything.</P>
<P>"And that comment is exactly why you’re uninitiated." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Into what?" </P>
<P>Buffy and Willow started giggling uncontrollably. Oz whispered to him.</P>
<P>"Oh." Xander said, turning red. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Later, at Buffy’s house, a large birthday floral arrangement was on the counter in the kitchen, with a helium balloon and card. The tickets to the ice show are attached. Joyce was at the stove making dinner. She heard the front door close.</P>
<P>"Buffy?"</P>
<P>"Present." She said looking at the flowers. "Ooh, present."</P>
<P>"They're not…they're from your father."</P>
<P>A deeply hurt expression showed on Buffy’s face as she saw the tickets and card.</P>
<P>"His quarterly projections are unraveling and he can't afford to take off right now. He promises to make it up to you. It's all right there in the letter."</P>
<P>She folded up the tickets and the card without even opening it.</P>
<P>"If you want, I could ask somebody to cover for me at the gallery. I mean, if you want me to take you."</P>
<P>"No, that's not necessary. I was just thinking it might be nice to have a quiet birthday."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>The same night at the library Buffy was training with Giles. Part of her training was to identify certain crystals and to learn their mystical properties. He got out the crystals and carefully laid them out on the table. Buffy sat and watched him.</P>
<P>"You know, it's not just cartoon characters. They do pieces from operas and ballets. Brian Boitano, doing Carmen, is a life changer. Oh, he doesn't actually play Carmen, but a lot of sophisticated people go."</P>
<P>"Yes, I think we should start with the grounding crystal again."</P>
<P>He sat the largest blue crystal on the table in front of her.</P>
<P>"You know, it's usually something that families do together."</P>
<P>"Now, look very carefully for the tiny flaw at its core."</P>
<P>"If someone were free, they'd take their daughter or their student...or their Slayer." She said, looking at him.</P>
<P>"Hmm? Yes, but, Buffy, I think we should concentrate now. Now, look for the flaw at its center." He was avoiding her attempts.</P>
<P>She gave in and started to concentrate on the crystal. At its center was a small stake-shaped flaw. Buffy slowly entered into a trance. Giles leaned over further and looked at her.</P>
<P>"Buffy?"</P>
<P>Seeing that she was firmly caught in the crystal's trance, he pulled a small case from his briefcase, set it on the table, and opened it. Inside was a hypodermic needle, a test tube full of a clear yellow liquid and an alcohol-soaked gauze pad. Keeping a careful eye on Buffy, he took the pad and leaned toward her. Taking her arm, he pushed up her sleeve and wiped the pad on a spot near the inside of her elbow. </P>
<P>He filled the syringe, and squirted out the fluid to get rid of any air bubbles. He took her arm in one hand and with the other, stuck in the needle. Slowly, he depressed the plunger, and she didn’t move at all.  He pulled the needle back out. He quickly he put everything away, and sat on the table. He then waved his hand between Buffy and the crystal. She came out of the trance.</P>
<P>"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I zone out on you? It's just... I'm nursing that flu bug."</P>
<P>"It's best to take care of that. Perhaps we should..."</P>
<P>"Call it a night? Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks."</P>
<P>She got up weakly and walked out of the library.  </P>
<P>"Good night."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Outside near the courtyard, Buffy and Willow were walking down the steps the next day.</P>
<P>"He didn’t even have the decency to call and tell me himself. I told you he was glad to get rid of me." </P>
<P>Willow didn’t know what to do or say. She would’ve hugged her, but she saw Snyder eyeing them across the yard.</P>
<P>"Oh, Buffy. I’m sorry."</P>
<P>"I’m not a bad person, am I? I mean, all I wanted was one day. It’s tradition!"</P>
<P>Buffy looked over and saw Cordelia looking at a quarreling couple. Buffy shifted her gaze too, focusing. It was a heated argument from what she could tell, and then the guy grabbed the girl’s arm. Buffy had to step in.</P>
<P>"Hey! I'm not through here." The guy said to his girlfriend.</P>
<P>Buffy grabbed his arm.</P>
<P>"Oh, I beg to differ."</P>
<P>She tried to yank at it, but she had absolutely no strength. He scoffed at her and nudged her away hard. She fell backward, stumbling onto a bench and rolling off onto the ground. Cordelia came over, angry, and shoved him away.</P>
<P>"What is wrong with you?" She asked, hitting him repeatedly in the chest.</P>
<P>"God, the chick started it!"</P>
<P>Willow got down to her knees to help Buffy up.</P>
<P>"Are you okay?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy and Willow rushed through the halls and caught up with Giles.</P>
<P>"Okay, I just got swatted down by some no-neck and rescued by Cordelia. What the hell is happening?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"I'm sure it'll sort itself out."</P>
<P>She and Willow were both shocked by his calm reaction.</P>
<P>"You're not getting the big picture here. I have no strength. I have no coordination. I throw knives like..."</P>
<P>"A girl?"</P>
<P>"Damn it, Giles! She needs to have her strength! She has a job to do, and she is in serious danger like this. How can you be so…not caring!" Willow said, a little louder then she intended. </P>
<P>"Look, Buffy, Willow, I assure you, um... given time...we'll get to the bottom of… whatever's causing this... anomaly."</P>
<P>"Promise me."</P>
<P>"Yes. I give you my word."</P>
<P>The two of them continued walking down the hall, leaving Giles behind.</P>
<P>"Wow, Will. Where’d that come from?"</P>
<P>"I have no idea. I’ve never…he was just pissing me off. He sounded like Xander!"</P>
<P>Buffy put her hand on Willow’s back, the closest contact they could show, smiled, and kept walking.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In an old boarding house, Giles was talking with a Council representative named Quentin Travers. In the room opposite the one they were sitting in, a coffin-like crate was in an upright position, shaking.</P>
<P>"You're having doubts." Quentin stated. "Cruciamentum is not easy...for Slayer or Watcher. But its been done this way for a dozen centuries. Whenever a Slayer turns eighteen. It's a time-honored rite of passage."</P>
<P>"It's an archaic exercise in cruelty. To lock her in this...tomb...weakened, defenseless. And to unleash that on her." Giles stared at the crate in the other room. "If any one of the Council still had actual contact with a Slayer, they would see, but I'm the one in the thick of it."</P>
<P>"Which is why you're not qualified to make this decision. You're too close."</P>
<P>"That's not true."</P>
<P>"A Slayer is not just physical prowess. She must have cunning, imagination; a confidence derived from self-reliance. And believe me, once this is all over, your Buffy will be stronger for it."</P>
<P>"Or she'll be dead for it."</P>
<p>Later, he was on his way out, trailed by Quentin.</P>
<P>"Rupert, if this girl is everything you say, then you've nothing to worry about."</P>
<P>Giles left without saying a word. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>After Giles left, loud screaming started to come from the crate. Reluctantly, two men, who were Quentin’s assistants, went over to the crate. One of the men opened the lock and removed it. He pulled open the latch and jerked open the crate. Inside was a very angry vampire secured in a straightjacket and strapped to the back of the crate with a metal band across his forehead. </P>
<P>"Come on. Come on." Quentin said.</P>
<P>The man stepped over to a table and pulled two pills from a bottle. He put them on a spoon that was secured to a long bar. The second man stood behind him with a glass of water also on the end of a long bar. The man with the spoon reached it up to the vampire's mouth.</P>
<P>"Kralik, your pills. Open your mouth."</P>
<P>He opened his mouth just enough, and the man nudged the spoon in, turned it to drop the pills in, then quickly retreated. The second man stepped up with the glass of water and angled it for Kralik to   drink.  He gulped deeply, spilling water down the sides of his mouth.</P>
<P>"That's enough. Close it up." Quentin said.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P>
<hr width=100>

<p>In the library, the gang was researching Buffy’s condition, absent Giles.</P>
<P>"Aha! A curse on Slayers." Willow said, and Buffy looked up, hopeful. "Oh, no. Wait. It's lawyers."</P>
<P>"You know, maybe we're on the wrong track with the whole spell, curse and whammy thing. Maybe what we should be looking for something like, Slayer kryptonite." Xander said.</P>
<P>"Faulty metaphor. Kryptonite kills." Oz said.</P>
<P>"You're assuming I meant the green kryptonite. I was referring, of course, to the red kryptonite, which drains Superman of his powers."</P>
<P>"Wrong. The gold kryptonite's the power-sucker. The red kryptonite mutates Superman into some sort of weird..."</P>
<P>"Guys? Reality?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"I know you are, definitely, without a doubt, gonna get your powers back." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Thanks, Will."</P>
<P>"But what if you don't?"</P>
<P>"Okay...if I don't get my powers back, then I don't. I'll deal. Honestly, I don’t know what I’ll do."</P>
<P>"Actually, this could open up so many..."</P>
<P>Giles came into the library, and Buffy ran up to him.</P>
<P>"Did you find anything?" She asked him.</P>
<P>"Uh, no. Not yet."</P>
<P>Buffy sighed, and picked up her red-hooded jacket and started for the door.</P>
<P>"I’m going home."</P>
<P>Willow ran over to her.</P>
<P>"Buffy stay over at my house. It’s closer…and safer."</P>
<P>"What about your parents?"</P>
<P>"They went to a retreat in Lake Tahoe or something. They came back long enough to give me a new food supply and then left." Willow looked sad for a minute, and then smiled again. "Anyway, I won’t take no for an answer."</P>
<P>"You talked me into it." Buffy smiled.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>They were sitting on Willow’s bed, and Buffy was crying.</P>
<P>"My dad ditches me, I lose my strength, what have I done?"</P>
<P>Willow held her close.</P>
<P>"You didn’t do anything, okay? None of it is your fault."</P>
<P>"I must have done something. This is probably what happens to slayers who don’t read the handbook." </P>
<P>"Then it’s Giles fault for not giving you the handbook in the first place then."</P>
<P>"I’m not gonna blame him."</P>
<P>"Don’t blame yourself either. Please?"</P>
<P>Buffy sighed, and lied down on the bed.</P>
<P>"What else can I do? I can’t do my job. I’m weak."</P>
<P>"Like me?"</P>
<P>"You know that’s not what I meant. Most of the time you’re stronger than I could ever be. I just…I feel…incomplete. I know I’m more than the Slayer, but it’s still a big part of who I am. I always keep talking about wanting something more normal, but now that I have it, I don’t want it anymore. I’m not me like this, and I…"</P>
<P>Willow lied down beside her.</P>
<P>"I want to forget. I want to be strong. I just want to be loved."</P>
<P>Willow, brushed some stray hairs off of Buffy’s forehead, reaching for her soon-to-be lover’s shirt.</P>
<P>"I can do that." Willow said smiling. "You know, right now, we’re both equal."</P>
<P>"Yeah, we are." Buffy ran her hand down Willow’s sweater.</P>
<P>"I wanted to do this when we both needed it. I dreamed we’d both be going into it this way. Completely equal. Like it should be. I want to love you in the best way."</P>
<P>She started to unbutton Buffy’s shirt.</P>
<P>"I need you to love me." Buffy said quietly.</P>
<P>A tear of happiness ran down Willow’s face, as she kissed Buffy.</P>
<P>"Are you scared? Cause I don’t want to rush you –"</P>
<P>Willow put a finger to Buffy’s lips.</P>
<P>"I want this just as much as you do. I want to give this to you. I need to forget too. I just want to be with you. To be able to love you like this."</P>
<P>Buffy gave Willow a loving kiss.</P>
<P>"Will you let me make love to you, Buffy?"</P>
<P>Buffy nodded. "I need your strength." </P>
<P>She felt Willow pull away a little.</P>
<p>"I'm not strong." Willow whispered, but Buffy shook her head.</P>
<p>"You are. I told you that you were stronger than I was. Trust me. Give me your strength, Will…"</P>
<p>Then there was silence. Buffy was afraid she'd scared Willow off, but then she felt Willow's arms go around her, and felt soft lips against her ear.</P>
<p>"We'll be strong together."</P>
<p>Gentle kisses, gentle lips moved over her, making her sigh with need, with passion. Buffy turned her head, caught Willow's lips with her own. She wondered if Willow would resist, because they both knew that this kiss was just the beginning. Once they started, there was no turning back. There was none; only Willow's mouth parting. They had kissed before, but this, this was deeper. It reached down to the core of their very being.</P>
<p>"I love you, Will…"</P>
<p>"I know."</P>
<p>Willow’s delicate hands reached under the soft fabric of her shirt, touching her while slipping off her shirt. They were definitely female hands. ‘<I>Willow’s hands’</I>. Buffy arched with pleasure at her touch.</P>
<P>She had the briefest memory of Angel flash in her head. Being with him was harder, more rushed, not like this sensation. He was full of passion, but he was cold. They were missing something then, and they were never able to connect fully. </P>
<P>Willow was warm and Buffy could feel it. Their heat was an instant connection. There was nothing hidden. There were no worries. They were free. They were slow, loving, preserving their first time. Buffy was drowning in the love and bliss that she felt coming through Willow’s caresses. </P>
<P>As she returned them, she began to understand just how perfect they were together. They were made for each other. She was Willow’s and Willow was hers. As she continued, she was amazed at the extent of the connection they now had. It wasn’t just physical, but emotional as well. She had forgotten everything else. She knew she would, and now she felt like she could see all the way down into Willow’s soul. </P>
<P>Only Willow. There was an immense understanding of each other that was occurring between them, and along with the physical pleasure, it was overwhelming. And beautiful. Buffy knew it was permanent; it wasn’t going to end when they stopped. It was going to last forever.</P>
<p>All ability to think clearly was gone now. All they felt, all they knew, was the cool air on their skin, and their hands exploring one another. It was endless. Curved bodies lying close, lush hollows and peaks to explore, not only with their hands, but with their mouths as well. Soon all they heard was murmured sighs as the ecstasy intensified.</P>
<p>Hearing Willow’s cries of joy, Buffy realized she was close too. They went over the edge together, and felt their strength meld together and held one another as they rode out the whirlwind of emotions threatening to overtake them both. As they came down, Buffy knew she would never ever love anyone with such intensity again, and thanked whoever had placed Willow in her life, over and over.</P>
