<!-- This Time Around \ Part Ten: Mission `Destroy Faith' -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Novak***</p>
<p>Mary Cherry sat on the plush couch in the Novak and watched Nicole
pace back and forth. They were here, early, to come up with some way
to get that new girl Faith back for embarrassing Nicole. No one
embarrassed Nicole, at least no one who lived long afterward. "So,
what are we gonna do?"</p>
<p>Nicole stopped pacing and stared at Mary Cherry. "Past."</p>
<p>Merry Cherry looked confused, ok she always looked confused but now
she looked more so than usually. "Past? Nicole what are yah
talkin' `bout?"</p>
<p>"Everyone has a hidden past. They hide it and hope no one finds it,
all we have to is find hers and she's history." Nicole said with an
unearthly glow in her eyes, had Faith seen it she definitely swear
Nicole was a demon.</p>
<p>Marry Cherry clapped her hands together like a deranged little
kid, "oooh that is brilliant, now how do we go about finding this
dark hidden past?"</p>
<p>Now Nicole added an evil smile, "leave that to me." And so
mission `destroy Faith' was about to begin, taking out everyone who
got in the way.</p>
