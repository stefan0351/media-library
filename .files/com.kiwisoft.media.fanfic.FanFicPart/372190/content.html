<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER NINE</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ALWAYS BY MY SIDE</p>
<p>A few days passed, and Miley continued to write in her new journal, still working on the song she'd started the other night. Being able to put her thoughts in writing seemed to help her deal with the sorrow of losing her mother, as did Lilly's constant comfort and companionship.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling today, Miles?" Lilly asked as she walked out onto the front porch of Mamaw Ruthie's house one morning. Miley, who had been busy writing in her journal, looked up to see Lilly sitting down beside her and smiled.</p>
<p>"I'm okay, thanks to you," Miley said softly, still smiling.</p>
<p>"Aww, stop," Lilly teased. "When my best friend needs me, there's nowhere else I'm gonna be, okay?" Miley closed her book and leaned against Lilly, resting her head on Lilly's shoulder.</p>
<p>"You don't have to stop just because I'm here," Lilly protested.</p>
<p>"That's okay, I'm taking my time with it," Miley replied. "I want it to really say what I feel about momma, you know?"</p>
<p>"I understand," Lilly replied. "If it's anything like the little bit you sang me the other night, I'm sure it'll be beautiful."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lilly," Miley whispered, snuggling against her best friend a bit more. "I'm really, really glad you're my best friend." Lilly blushed slightly.</p>
<p>"I'm glad too, Miley; you're the best friend I've ever had." She leaned down slightly to kiss Miley on the top of her head, but at the last moment, Miley suddenly turned to look up at her… and for a brief moment, their lips touched. Lilly quickly jerked away – though not, she noticed, as quickly as perhaps she could have – blushing furiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, god! Miley, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to…!" she stammered.</p>
<p>"It's… it's okay, Lilly," Miley managed. She too was blushing, her cheeks a deep red. "It was kinda m-my fault too."</p>
<p>"Please tell me this doesn't ruin things between us!" Lilly pleaded.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Lilly, really," Miley assured her. "It was just an accident. Besides, it… it wasn't that bad." Lilly opened her mouth to say something, but Miley cut her off.</p>
<p>"Look, let's just promise to never say another word about it, okay?"</p>
<p>"All right," Lilly promised, though her thoughts and emotions were still in turmoil. "I promise, Miley."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Elsewhere, in the small bedroom he and his son Jackson were sharing, Robbie Ray Stewart finally found the courage to deal with something he'd been dreading since his beloved wife passed away.</p>
<p>Carefully hidden in the back of his suitcase, where no one else could see, was a simple letter… the last his wife had ever written to him. He'd found it the day after she passed away, underneath his pillow in the bed they'd once shared, but he hadn't been able to bring himself to read it. Instead, he brought it with him, waiting for the moment when he'd finally feel strong enough to read Susan's final words. Today, at last, he finally felt he was ready.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Robbie Ray slipped the letter out of its hiding place, carefully opened it and pulled out the single piece of neatly folded paper. The scent of Susan's perfume filled his nostrils.</p>
<p>"I miss you, baby," Robbie Ray whispered. Settling back on his bed, he slowly unfolded the letter and began to read it…</p>
<p><i>Dearest Robbie,</i></p>
<p><i>If you're reading this honey, then it means that I have died. If I know you, you've probably also waited as long as possible to actually read this, but I understand. If you had died and I was the one left alone, I doubt I'd have the courage to read your farewell letter either… but there are some things I need to say while I still have time.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, I know what you're going to say… but I know I don't have much time left in this world. The doctors have done all they can; it's in God's hands now. </i></p>
<p><i>More than anything Robbie, I want you to know how much I love you. From the moment I first saw you, I knew I was going to spend the rest of my life with you, and I never wanted to be with anyone else. Never doubt that, baby. We swore we'd always be together, and we will be…and someday it'll be forever… but I know that time isn't now.</i></p>
<p><i>Take care of Miley and Jackson for me, and tell them their momma will always love them. I know it won't be easy learning how to take care of everything yourself, but you're a strong man and I know you can do it. Your love for them, and theirs for you, will carry you through all the hard times ahead.</i></p>
<p><i>There's one last thing I need you to do for me, honey. I've written a special letter for Miley, and I want you to give it to her on her wedding day. There are certain things I need to say to her when she's ready to start a life of her own, and since I won't be around for the wonderful day itself, this is the only way I can do so now. You'll find her letter in the same envelope, alongside the one for you. Promise you'll do this for me.</i></p>
<p><i>Well, I'm getting tired now honey, so I think I'd better go. Never forget how much I love you. I will always be with you, Robbie Ray Stewart. Forever yours,</i></p>
<p><i>Susie</i></p>
<p>By the time he was finished reading the letter, Robbie Ray's eyes were filled with tears. This time though, he didn't bother trying to hide them. Instead, he carefully folded Susan's letter, slid it back into the envelope, and just sat there, letting all the love and sorrow he felt for his beloved wife wash over him.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>In another part of Franklin, Tennessee, another member of the Stewart family was dealing with his mother's passing in his own way. Jackson Stewart stood in front of his mother's grave, staring at it silently while a cool wind blew over him.</p>
<p>"I love you, mom," he whispered. Ever since her passing, Jackson had been deliberately distant from the rest of his family, struggling on his to come to terms with it. He loved his mother as much as any of them, and her tragic passing had hurt him just as deeply, but Jackson had never been truly comfortable showing others how he felt. Only now, alone, did he feel he could finally deal with all the feelings he had been keeping pent up inside him.</p>
<p>"I hope you don't think I forgot you," he whispered again. "I promise I haven't, and I never will; it's just… it's hard sometimes, you know? Dad and Mamaw and even Miley, they all mean well, but… I don't feel like I can really talk to any of them. I just don't think they'd understand." Drawing in a deep breath, Jackson knelt beside his mother's grave.</p>
<p>"I <i>do</i> miss you mom, very much. I just… I just don't feel like I can show it the same way the others do. It hurts inside… and that's just where it stays, you know? I hope that makes sense." Jackson shook his head.</p>
<p>"By the way, Miley and Dad are both doing okay," he continued. "I know you're probably worried about them, mom. Miley's got Lilly, same as always. I swear, Lilly hasn't left her side for a moment." Jackson smiled a little at the thought. Though he might never admit it openly, he loved his little sister and was glad she had such a caring friend to take care of her.</p>
<p>"Dad's been spending most of his time with Mamaw," Jackson added. "I guess she kinda knows how he feels, losing grandpa and all. She's been really patient too, letting dad take his own time with things; she said we could all stay as long as we needed to." Swallowing, Jackson stopped. Carefully, quietly, he reached into his long jacket and pulled out a single rose, when he then laid gently on his mother's grave.</p>
<p>"I know it's not much, but here you go mom. I promise I'll visit whenever I can, okay? I should probably get back before Dad and Mamaw start to worry." Jackson stood again, wrapping his arms around himself.</p>
<p>"I'll take care of Dad and Miley… as much they'll let me, anyway. Rest in peace, momma… I love you." Doing his best to hide the single tear trickling from the corner of his eye – traitorous proof of his very human emotions – Jackson slowly walked back to the car and his waiting aunt.</p>
<p>"You okay honey?" Aunt Dolly greeted him.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Jackson insisted, quickly wiping away the tear. "Just needed to get some things off my chest is all." Dolly smiled sadly.</p>
<p>"I understand," she said gently. "Anytime you need some time alone with your mommda, you just let me know, darlin'; I'll be glad to bring you here whenever you want, no questions asked." Jackson nodded.</p>
<p>"Sure… and thanks for everything, Aunt Dolly."</p>
<p>"Anytime honey; anytime."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Back at Mamaw Ruthie's, Miley's best friend, blonde tomboy Lilly Truscott, was doing some thinking of her own. She was lying on the small bed she and Miley were sharing while they were staying with her grandmother, staring up at the ceiling. Miley was down the hall, using the restroom, and Lilly was using the quiet moment alone to think about something that had been bothering her all day: the accidental kiss she and Miley had shared earlier, and Miley's reaction afterwards.</p>
<p>"It wasn't that bad?" Lilly wondered aloud, repeating Miley's previous words to herself. "What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p><i>She couldn't have actually </i>enjoyed<i> it, could she? </i>Lilly thought to herself. <i>Nah, that's just crazy! I mean, it </i>was <i>kinda nice, but…</i></p>
<p>"I did <i>not</i> just think that," Lilly muttered to herself. "Okay yeah, I really love Miley, but I can't love her like that!"</p>
<p><i>Even if she does have the softest lips…</i></p>
<p>"Stop that!" Lilly hissed.</p>
<p>"Stop what?" Miley asked, walking back into the room.</p>
<p>"Uh, nothing!" Lilly shouted, immediately jumping up from the bed. "I was just, y'know, thinking out loud!" Miley arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"What were you thinking about?" she asked uncertainly.</p>
<p>"Oh, you know; just… stuff," Lilly lied.</p>
<p>"You're not still thinking about earlier, are you?" Miley asked her carefully. Lilly hung her head.</p>
<p>"I really am sorry," Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>"Lilly," Miley said gently, sitting down on the bed beside her best friend, "it's okay, really. You didn't do anything wrong." She took Lilly's hands in her own.</p>
<p>"Did it really bother you that much?" she asked. She grinned as Lilly shook her head enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"No, not at all! I mean, it was just a little kiss, right?" Lilly replied, perhaps just a little too quickly.</p>
<p>"Right," Miley agreed, "and our friendship can stand one little accidental kiss, right?"</p>
<p>"Sure it can," Lilly answered happily. "I would never want to lose you, Miles."</p>
<p>"No chance of that, Lils," Miley replied, smiling warmly. "You're stuck with me now."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't wanna be stuck with anyone else," Lilly said honestly, smiling as well. Miley leaned forward and hugged Lilly warmly. After they parted, Lilly suddenly began to feel very bold.</p>
<p>"Besides, the kiss wasn't that bad, was it?" she asked quickly.</p>
<p>"Nah, you're a pretty good kisser," Miley said with a giggle.</p>
<p>"I am?" Lilly couldn't help teasing. Miley playfully swatted at her.</p>
<p>"Stop it!" she laughed. "Anyway, you don't have to worry about it anymore, okay?" She cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"Hey, you wanna see something Lils?" Miley asked. Lilly nodded, and Miley got up from the bed and walked over to the single closet in the room.</p>
<p>"I got my dad to bring this from home," Miley explained as she reached into the closet. Lilly watched as she carefully pulled out a small wooden guitar.</p>
<p>"Can you actually play that?" Lilly asked her, astonished. Miley nodded, blushing a little.</p>
<p>"What can I say, my daddy was a singer," she replied, smiling shyly. "He taught me how to play when I was younger." She sat back down on the bed carefully and slowly began to pick at the guitar's strings. Slowly but surely, Miley began to play a haunting tune.</p>
<p>"Wow," Lilly whispered. "You're really good, Miley."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lilly," Miley said, smiling. "I just like to play for fun sometimes."</p>
<p>"Do you think… you could teach me a little?" Lilly asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Well… it takes lots of practice to really learn how to play the guitar, but I guess I could show you a little bit," Miley replied hesitantly. "You really want to?" Lilly nodded enthusiastically, and Miley giggled.</p>
<p>"Okay, come here," she said softly, gesturing to Lilly. Lilly crept forward on the bed and sat down beside her best friend. Miley gently handed her the guitar, instructing her how to hold it.</p>
<p>"Now, you strum the strings here," Miley began, guiding Lilly's hand to the strings in the center of the guitar's body. "You put your other hand on the neck of the guitar and use your fingers to hold down the strings up there so they can vibrate and make sounds." Lilly struggled for a moment to get a good grip on the neck of the guitar, but she couldn't quite seem to make her fingers work the way she wanted them to.</p>
<p>"Here, let me help you," Miley said. She slid behind Lilly and helped guide her other hand into a proper position on the neck of the guitar.</p>
<p>"There you go," Miley told her. "You hold you fingers on the strings in different positions to play different notes."</p>
<p>"Like… this?" Lilly replied, awkwardly attempting to play a little. She had become acutely aware of how close Miley was to her, and of the feeling of Miley's arms practically wrapped around her from behind. For reasons she didn't entirely understand, her heart began to beat faster, and her mouth grew dry.</p>
<p><i>Am I going nuts? Why am I feeling like this?</i> Lilly wondered to herself.</p>
<p>"You okay, Lilly?" Miley asked, noticing how quiet her best friend had suddenly become.</p>
<p>"Y-yeah," Lilly managed. "I'm fine. So am I doing this right?" She looked back down at the guitar she was still holding.</p>
<p>"You're doing fine," Miley assured her, smiling. At that moment, a familiar voice startled them both.</p>
<p>"Girls, dinner!" Ruthie's voice called out.</p>
<p>"Be right there, mamaw!" Miley shouted back. She looked back at Lilly.</p>
<p>"We can practice more later, if you want," she offered warmly.</p>
<p>"Okay," Lilly replied. "Thanks, Miley."</p>
<p>"Only for my best friend," Miley replied warmly. "Now come on, before Jackson eats all the biscuits!" She jumped up and darted out the bedroom, heading downstairs. Lilly remind behind for a moment, staring after her best friend and wondering why, all of the sudden, she couldn't help but notice just how beautiful Miley really was… especially when she smiled</p>
