<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 23 -->

<p>Katie brushed her lips against the soft skin
of Jessie bare shoulder, wrapping her arms around her girlfriends waist more firmly,
pressing up against her back, needing to be as close to her as humanly possible.
"How's the case going?" she asked her eyes flickering the television screen
that they were watching before she got distracted.</p>

<p>Feeling Jessie shift in her arms until they
were face to face Katie looked down to see Jessie looking at her incredulously, shaking
her head in dismay.</p>

<p>"What?" Katie asked.</p>

<p>"We wrapped that last week," Jessie
responded.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me that,"
Katie responded as she desperately searched her memory, though she was fairly confident
that Jessie hadn't told her - though that kind of made no sense whatsoever
because this was precisely the type of thing that Jessie would have told her. But she
couldn't remember so she obviously hadn't. Jessie was fallible too after all.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," Jessie replied,
perfectly aware of exactly when she had told Katie.</p>

<p>"When?" Katie asked skeptically
painfully aware of the fact that Jessie sounded much more confident that she had told her
than she did that she hadn't told her.</p>

<p>"On Friday. Why do you think we used the
whirlpool jets in the tub and were drinking champagne?" Jessie asked watching as
Katie's eyes clouded over.</p>

<p>At the mention of Friday Katie's mind
became overcome with memories of Jessie slowly stripping in front of her, lowering herself
into the tub like a goddess. And memories of Jessie's hands roaming over of bare wet
skin working scented oils into her muscles. And memories of Jessie tipping glasses of
bubbly champagne for her to consume, before bringing their lips together for long, deep
kisses. At no point whatsoever, did Katie flash back to Jessie telling her about the case.</p>

<p>"You told me about it with your naked
body pressed up against mine, as you feed me champagne by the bottle and rubbed me with
scented oils and you expected me to remember?" Katie asked incredulously, looking at
Jessie like she was insane. "All I remember about Friday is ... mmm," she
continued biting her bottom lips as more memories flooded into her mind.</p>

<p>"You know," Jessie said playfully,
placing her hand and Katie's hip, stroking the skin lightly with her thumb. "I
think you're hornier now than in high school."</p>

<p>"That's not true," Katie
grumbled in response, Jessie's voice bringing her back to the present. Jessie merely
looked at her unconvinced. "I was just better hiding it back then," Katie
continued when Jessie didn't respond.</p>

<p>"How is that at all possible?"
Jessie asked thinking that teenagers weren't exactly renowned for their self-control.</p>

<p>"It's quite simple really,"
Katie began a scholarly tone. "You see, back then I was in a state of perpetual
horniness, a lusty haze as it were, like most teenagers are. And because this condition
was so prevalent after the initial outbreak it retreated to the recesses of my mind
becoming like a shadow, and thus manageable," she continued trying not to laugh at
Jessie expression. "Now, after years and years, you've reintroduced the
perpetual state of horniness into the equation catching me completely unaware," she
concluded with a long-suffering sigh.</p>

<p>"You amaze me," Jessie said smiling.
"It's completely insane how you can say the most inappropriate, borderline
offense things, but no matter comes out of your mouth, I always find it cute and charming,
and..." Jessie continued before being interrupted.</p>

<p>"And it makes you want to ravage
me," Katie interjected winking at Jessie.</p>

<p>"See," Jessie said pointing at her.
"Why is that endearing?"</p>

<p>Katie made a great effort to look like she was
considering this question, and then with the utmost seriousness returned her gaze to
Jessie, and said, "It'd probably help if you ravaged me."</p>

<p>Jessie smirked at this response, and pushed
against Katie's shoulders gently until the other woman was lying on her back then
shifted so that she was straddling Katie's waist. Placing her hands on both sides of
Katie's body, Jessie then began to slowly run them up and down, looking down at her
girlfriend with a wicked grin on her face.</p>

<p>Katie smiled back up at Jessie, her breathing
already increasing as Jessie continued her slow caress, the thought of an immediate future
of loving causing her to shiver.</p>

<p>"Maybe later," Jessie responded
feeling a tremble run through Katie's body. Then she rolled off of the other woman so
that they were both lying on their backs.</p>

<p>"Th...a..." was all Katie
managed to choke out as she lay there staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Aw," Jessie cooed flipping onto her
side so that she could see Katie. "You're so cute when you're sexually
frustrated."</p>

<p>"I am not," Katie mumbled pouting
slightly as she shot a harassed look Jessie's way. "Besides," she continued
huffily. "I don't' need you."</p>

<p>"Really?" Jessie asked in an
intrigued tone.</p>

<p>"That's not what I meant,"
Katie said shooting Jessie a look as the blonde grinned at her.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it," Jessie
said laughing as Katie stewed beside her. "All that time I was worrying about Sarah,
when I really should've been jealous of your right hand."</p>

<p>"Pipe down," Katie replied blushing,
shooting Jessie another look.</p>

<p>"It's alright," Jessie said
adopting a scholarly tone like Katie had used minutes before. "Studies say that
everyone does it. It's a perfectly normal, and healthy biological function."</p>

<p>"Really?" Katie asked finally
turning to meet Jessie's gaze. "Is that what took you so long in the shower the
morning after Lily made me sleepover? A normal, and healthy biological function?" she
asked grinning as Jessie's smile slowly faded from her face.</p>

<p>"Watch the movie," Jessie mumbled
dropping her head onto Katie's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Katie breathed out
looking down at the top of Jessie's head. She'd just been kidding, she
hadn't actually thought that that was what had really kept Jessie so long that
morning, but now it looked like she was right, and really the thought delighted her.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Jessie responded
blushing. It wasn't her fault, Katie had kept her word and tossed and turned onto her
in the middle of the night. And once she had wrapped herself around her she'd
proceeded to shift and rub up against her for the entire night. It was torture of the best
variety. "Hey," Jessie continued when Katie continued to chuckle. "If you
don't stop you're going have plenty of time to get to know yourself."</p>

<p>Katie promptly stopped laughing, and Jessie
smiled. This was much better.</p>
