<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Shadow Boxing -->

<p>?Coming out? to their friends at Nicole?s dinner party had had a distant ripple effect at school, (thanks to a certain overexcited Southern belle).  Since Sam and Brooke were now back at Kennedy, all four girls plus Sugar Daddy were the subjects of hushed whispers, stares and vague hand gestures.  For the most part they ignored the reaction.  Sugar Daddy was so well liked anyway that no one really bothered him and Nicole was still somewhat slave to her ?bitch? persona within the confines of the building, so she just threatened to eviscerate one or two individuals.  But all in all, it was blissfully normal for the time being.</p>
<p>Which was why Sam?s skin was starting to itch.  Those telltale crawling sensations across the surface, kind of prickly like when a limb falls asleep or your hair stands on end that usually precludes a major thunderstorm or big news on a personal front.  Something big was brewing, somewhere just out of her line of sight and it was making her edgy.</p>
<p>"You?re just being paranoid, Sammy," Brooke whispered as she lay with her nose buried the crook of Sam?s neck.  A fine sheen of sweat coated them as they lay tangled together, spent.</p>
<p>"I?m sorry," Sam sighed as she stroked Brooke?s slightly damp hair slowly.  "I just can?t shake the feeling that he?s up to something." Brooke giggled slightly.</p>
<p>"You are SO killing my buzz," she complained lightly.  She lifted her head and placed a loving kiss to Sam?s already kiss swollen lips.  Despite herself, a part of Brooke couldn?t help but agree with Sam.  Mike had been too quiet for too long.  She knew that the papers that Kelly and Jane recently filed petitioning for Jane to be named her legal guardian had to have reached him by now and he HAD to be furious.  And given all his threats in the past, she too was afraid that he was plotting his next move.</p>
<p>She felt Sam shiver under her and knew it had nothing to do with the fan blowing cool air against them.</p>
<p>"I won?t let him hurt you again, Sam," Brooke vowed, her voice rock solid. "There will be no more abuse of my Sam."</p>
<p>"No ?Samabusage?, eh?" Sam laughed. "Sounds nice."</p>
<p>"I give you my word," Brooke told her seriously.</p>
<p>"I?m not worried about me, Brooke.  Hell, he can grind me into a fine paste for all I care.  I?m worried about you and Mac," Sam explained.</p>
<p>"Don?t say that, Sammy.  _I_ care if something happens to you," Brooke countered hugging the brunette closer.  Sam sighed again.</p>
<p>"I know that, love.  I only mean that to me, my safety comes second to you and Mac.  I will NOT let anything happen to either of you so long as I?m around.  Ever." Sam?s voice shook with the force with which she spoke and Brooke knew without a doubt that Sam would sacrifice everything for her.  It touched her deeply but it also frightened her.  She was worried that Sam might take an unnecessary risk to protect her.</p>
<p>Her mind involuntarily floated back to the night Kelly and Sam had ?rescued? her from the Palace and her last ?conversation? with her father.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; He had slammed Brooke's bedroom door behind them, turning to his daughter barely in control of his fear and rage. Brooke eyed him fearfully.</p>
<p>"Let's get a few things straight, young lady," he snarled. "I HAVE to let you go with her, but if you say anything, ANYTHING about what's been going on around here, when I get my hands on you, you will regret the day you EVER took your first breath."</p>
<p> Little did he know that she already did for most of the time she was stuck with him since the mess started.</p>
<p>"Second, you stay the HELL away from Sam McPherson. I don't want to see or hear about you seeing her or talking to her and trust me, I have ways of knowing whether or not you do," he continued to threaten as Brooke packed a few things, shaking as she did so. Mike was so out of control that she was unsure she was going to get out of the house alive at this point. When she was done, she headed to the door. Mike had used his bigger bulk to pin her against it.</p>
<p>"One more thing," he whispered, leaning in dangerously close. "You go to the police, Brooke, and it'll be the LAST thing you EVER do. Do you understand me?" Brooke nodded and refused to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>She just wanted OUT.</p>
<p>"And if YOU happen to forget, maybe I can remind Mac," he threatened. Brooke's stomach churned.</p>
<p>"No?" she croaked. Mike nodded, a cruel smile lighting up his face.</p>
<p>She remembered the smile as inhuman.</p>
<p>"Yes. Remember, Brooke, that I do have another daughter. If you can't obey me for your sake, think about her." Brooke swallowed the bile that rose up at the images of her father hurting a poor innocent and defenseless Mackenzie.</p>
<p>"I understand," she whispered, effectively silenced. She'd never let any harm come to Mac and she knew that Mike was aware of that. She's just been expertly emotionally blackmailed.</p>
<p>"Good. Remember what I told you and maybe this will all work out."&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Of course, she had almost immediately gone against his wishes from the moment she?d left the house.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;Sam had suddenly appeared in the door and climbed in Kelly?s SUV, wrapping Brooke up in her arms.</p>
<p>"Yes. I told you I was going to get you out of there, didn't I?" She then nuzzled Brooke's hair. "I went to your mom, told her what was going on and asked her for her help. Help that she's willing to give, Brooke." </p>
<p>"I can't take you to San Francisco, with me, Brooke. I'm sorry but I'm still not the mother you need. Jane McPherson is. But I'm willing to do whatever I have to to get you away from your father. Whether you file for emancipation or try to get Jane to take custody of you or however the legal system works, I'll support you," Kelly explained.</p>
<p>"You're free, Brooke," Sam whispered. "You never have to go back." Brooke burst into fresh tears.</p>
<p>"But?" she started and stopped.</p>
<p>She was torn over whether to tell or not.  But the truth won out.  It was too horrible a secret to keep.</p>
<p>"'But' what, Brooke?" Sam prompted.</p>
<p>"Mac?" she said softly. Sam frowned and leaned down to catch Brooke's eye.</p>
<p>"What about Mac?" Brooke looked into Sam's rich chocolate eyes.</p>
<p>"He threatened her, Sammy. He said if I told anyone, he's take it out on her," she explained quietly. Sam paled.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ," Kelly breathed. Anger and rage filled every cell of Sam's being.</p>
<p>"I'll kill him. I'll fucking kill him first," she swore.&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The look on Sam?s face that night had frightened Brooke.  She knew without a doubt that Sam had meant every word she?d said.  Somehow, Sam, sweet peaceful Sam would kill Mike before she let him hurt baby Mac.  And Brooke found that she couldn?t blame Sam for her rage.  She actually agreed with her.</p>
<p>Still, she?d sought reassurance and received it.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;"It'll work out, won't it, Sam?" she asked, openly vulnerable and needing to be reassured. Sam kissed her gently and smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes. I promise it will. I'll make sure of it," Sam vowed.&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And like always when Sam was near, Brooke felt safe.</p>
<p>"Sammy, promise me if anything should happen, that you won?t do anything?drastic?" Brooke asked quietly.  Sam frowned in confusion and then arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, hon?" Brooke lifted her head to actually look Sam in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I mean, if my Dad should come around causing trouble, don?t go all ?medieval? on his ass.  Yes, call the cops and whatnot but, please don?t go chasing him with a baseball bat or something." Sam giggled.</p>
<p>"I?d use something bigger?and sharper," she retorted wryly.  Brooke huffed.</p>
<p>"Damn it, Sam, that?s what I mean," she said exasperated.  "Let the cops deal with it."</p>
<p>"Not if he?s hurting you or Mac, or Mom, I won?t," Sam said simply. "Over my cold, dead body." Brooke shivered.  Now there was exactly the image she was trying desperately to avoid.</p>
<p>"Fine," Brooke said sharply, pulling away and rolling over so that her back faced Sam.  Sam swore to herself and then moved to spoon behind Brooke, throwing an arm over the blonde?s side.</p>
<p>"Brooke, hon," she whispered. "All I mean is that I can?t sit by and let him hurt the people I love if I can stop him.  But no, I won?t take any ?unnecessary? risks or anything like that.  OK?" She felt Brooke nod.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy," Brooke whispered.  Sam kissed the back of Brooke?s neck.</p>
<p>"Welcome. Night."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"This is not happening.  This is not happening. This is not happening," Brooke kept repeating her mantra as she rocked a bawling Mac in her arms and watched Sam stand defensively on the front porch a week later.  She thought maybe if she said it enough times it would make it true.  After all, how ironic was it to be living the conversation she had with Sam less than 6 days ago?</p>
<p>"You?re not getting in here, Mike.  Not now, not ever," she heard Sam growl at Mike who was red faced and screaming from the walkway.</p>
<p>"You CAN?T keep me from my daughters!" Mike bellowed. "I have a parental right to both of them.  They?re mine!"</p>
<p>Brooke could see Sam?s hands balled into tight fists by her sides as she squared off against the larger man.  To her credit, Sam stayed on the porch, only getting more agitated when Mike approached her.  She didn?t try to rush him and wasn?t raising her voice or irritating him any further.</p>
<p>"Just leave Mike," Brooke heard Sam sigh.</p>
<p>"Come on, where are the fucking cops?" Brooke muttered as she switched the arm Mac was in and the toddler kept crying.  Mac was reacting to the emotions around her and it didn?t help that a few tears were streaking down Brooke?s face, although borne of fear for Sam.</p>
<p>Jane was in a meeting with her lawyer and had left Mac in the care of Sam and Brooke figuring it would be a quiet day.  Kelly had returned to San Francisco and Terri was out grocery shopping.  Now Brooke was wishing one of the adults were home or that the cops would hurry up.  She?d called as soon as her father?s all-too-familiar car had pulled into the driveway.</p>
<p>"Mike, you know that the restraining orders say that you can?t come near me or Brooke or this house.  And if you want to visit with MacKenzie you have to have a court appointed social worker with you," Sam said calmly.  Mike?s face got even redder, which Brooke wasn?t sure was even humanly possible.  </p>
<p>"How can my own daughter have a restraining order against me?" Mike screamed.  Both Brooke and Sam flinched at his volume. "You pressured her into getting one," he accused darkly.  He looked past Sam and saw Brooke in the window.</p>
<p>"Brooke!  I see you there!  Bring Mac out to me!" he called.  "I shouldn?t need permission to see my own Goddamn kids!" Brooke retreated from the window.  Sam took one step down off the porch.</p>
<p>"The police are on the way, Mike.  You should leave," she said lowly.  Mike ignored her.</p>
<p>"What is this petition to have Jane named your legal guardian, Brooke?" Mike growled, stepping towards Sam.  </p>
<p>"Sammy, look out?" Brooke hissed quietly.</p>
<p>"I warned you what would happen!" Mike threatened.  He got close enough to jostle Sam, hard.  She regained her footing and went right back at him.</p>
<p>"Don?t you threaten her," Sam snapped, shoving him backwards.  Mike?s stare left the house and refocused on the small girl in front of him.</p>
<p>"I?m going in that house and getting my daughters and YOU can?t stop me," he informed her angrily.  Sam took up her fighting stance, grit her teeth together for something she really didn?t want to do and prepared herself for what was to follow.</p>
<p>"Wanna bet?" Mike barked a harsh laugh at her.</p>
<p>"Remember what happened last time?" he snarled.  Sam flinched slightly in spite of herself at the still vivid memory of the last pounding she took from Mike that broke a bone in her face.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well this time she?s got back up," growled a voice from behind Sam.  Sam grinned as Nicole suddenly appeared beside her. "And I swear, if I break a well-manicured nail kicking your sorry ass, McQueen, I?ll sue."  Mike glowered at her.</p>
<p>"Satan," Sam said in greeting with a nod as Mike regarded the two of them as if weighing his odds.</p>
<p>"Spam," Nicole returned the gesture. "B called.  Lily and I came in the back way."</p>
<p>"I may be small but I?m Puerto Rican and not afraid to use it," grumbled Lily, now appearing on Sam?s other side.  She glared hotly at Mike. "Tráigale en usted el cobarde del blando-pene." Sam snickered, her Spanish rusty but understanding enough.</p>
<p>"They are MY daughters," Mike hissed.</p>
<p>"That doesn?t automatically give you ownership," Sam retorted. "You forfeited any rights you MIGHT have had when you hit Brooke and threatened Mac." Off in the distance, sirens began to grow closer.</p>
<p>"Ooo, I think they?re playing your song, Mike," Nicole sneered. "You know the one I mean. ?Violating restraining orders, trespassing, breach of peace, creating a disturbance, threatening, risk of injury to a minor?? Gee, that?s a few songs." She chuckled at her own dark humor.</p>
<p>"So, what do you figure?  A big old fine? By the time MY well paid army of lawyers are done with you, the Julian ?dream team?, you?ll be broke, homeless, toothless and?well generally any other ?less that you can come up with."</p>
<p>"You stay out of this, you dyke," Mike growled. "This is family business."</p>
<p>"Oooh, add hate crime," Lily pointed out to no one in particular as the sirens grew closer.  She understood that Nicole was just trying to stall Mike from any further rash action until the police arrived.  And if Nicole was good at anything, it was running off at the mouth.</p>
<p>"And Sam and Brooke ARE my family," Nicole hissed back in the same tone Mike used.  She was the LAST person he was going to intimidate.  "You mess with them or Jane, Mac, and Terri and you mess with me and Lily.  And we?ll kick your ass."</p>
<p>Brooke watched as two large male neighbors approached Mike.</p>
<p>"Hey, man, I think you better leave," one about the size of a mountain grumbled, his dark hair in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Fuck off," Mike snapped.</p>
<p>"Now, that?s not very nice," the other, slightly smaller man said.  They exchanged looks.</p>
<p>"These girls have asked you politely to leave.  Now we?re telling you.  LEAVE," the first one bellowed.  Brooke could have sworn her windows shook.  She recognized them as Paul and Jason, brothers that lived next door and hung out once in a while.  Mike let out a string of expletives at the two.</p>
<p>"I was hoping it wouldn?t come to this," Paul, the slightly smaller one sighed dramatically.  Jason lifted Mike like a child?s toy and carried him, kicking and screaming, to the sidewalk away from the girls just as the police pulled up.</p>
<p>"Now THAT was funny," Nicole snickered as the police approached them for a statement and Brooke exited the house.</p>
<p>"True," Sam mumbled. "God, I don?t need this stress."</p>
<p>"Thanks guys," Brooke smiled at Paul and Jason who had left Mike with the cops and walked over to see if everyone was OK.</p>
<p>"No problem, Brooke," Paul grinned. "Just yell if he ever shows up again."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Jason grunted.  The brothers walked back to their house although Lily did see Paul sending a few quick glances at Nicole.  She smiled to herself.</p>
<p>&lt;Sorry, guy, she?s taken&gt;</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Jane was beside herself after she got home and heard everything that had happened.  She immediately called the best home security company she knew and made an appointment for installation the next day, hoping at least that much protection would make everyone feel safer.  She wanted to do more but Sam reminded her that she didn?t want this new home to become a prison as well.</p>
<p>"Sounds like you handled yourself well, Sam," Jane said happy that her daughter came out unscathed. "And thanks for being here to help you two," she said to Nicole and Lily who were helping themselves to Terri?s Texas-style chili.</p>
<p>"Y?r wel?c?m," Nicole mumbled around a mouthful.  Lily laughed and playfully slapped her lover on the arm. </p>
<p>"Don?t talk with your mouth full.  Of any of us, I?d think YOU?D know it?s unladylike." Nicole blushed.</p>
<p>"Sowwee," she mumbled.</p>
<p>"I?m glad you kept your word to me, Sammy," Brooke purred as she hugged Sam.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Sam asked and then yelped as she got a mouthful of hot pepper.  Brooke handed her a ready glass of ice-cold milk.</p>
<p>"Yeah.  You stayed calm and on the porch for most of it.  Even when he pushed you, you kept your cool for the most part.  I?m proud of you," she explained as Sam?s eyes watered but not from her loving words.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Sam croaked. "Hoooot?" she whined.  Terri started laughing.</p>
<p>"Awww, is poor Sammy not used to good ole fashion down home spicy Texas cooking?" she teased as Sam buried her face in Brooke?s neck and whimpered.</p>
<p>"Nooooooo?" Sam moaned pitifully. </p>
<p>"Awww?" Brooke handed her another glass of milk.  Sam shot Terri a mock dirty look.</p>
<p>"You no cook dinner no more," she announced in a pout.</p>
<p>"Next time I?ll make you a mild version, Sammy," Terri said.  She then winked at Nicole and Lily who were having no problems. "Wimp."</p>
<p>"HEY!" Sam yelled.  She glared at the older blonde who put her hands up in defense.</p>
<p>"Just kidding?geesh."</p>
<p>"They let Mike go," Jane sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose and bringing the conversation back to the matter at hand. "He had no trouble posting bail on the ?violation of restraining orders? charges."</p>
<p>"Of course not, he?s a McQueen," Nicole said ruefully. "Hmmm, never thought that?d ever be a BAD thing."</p>
<p>"Well, now he has MORE charges pending," Terri said simply. "If he knows what?s good for him, he?ll lay low and out of our hair for a while." Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but since when does he ever do the smart thing, lately?"</p>
<p>No one had an answer for her.</p>
