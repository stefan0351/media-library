<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 44: New arrival -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway came out of her ready room and took her place on the bridge.
</P>
<P>"Good morning," Chakotay said as she sat.</P>
<P>"Commander," she said with a smile. "Anything exciting to report?"</P>
<P>"Smooth sailing." He leaned back into his chair. "We can do that overhaul of
the warp coils we’ve been putting off."</P>
<P>"I think B’Elanna planned her maternity leave with just that in mind,"
Janeway said with a smirk.</P>
<P>"She and Seven are probably both sleeping in while Vorik is dealing with the
overhaul." Chakotay shook his head. "Some people have all the luck."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Samantha settled B’Elanna onto her back. "Should I give her a stimulant?"</P>
<P>"No," Opaca said. "She’s fine. She just fainted. No need to mess up her
chemistry." Opaca smiled at Samantha. "A screaming Borg, and fainting Klingon,
and this is still smoother than your delivery."</P>
<P>Samantha nodded, amazed that the hologram was so knowledgeable about Naomi’s
birth.</P>
<P>"Wake her up," Seven yelled. The contraction was the most painful yet.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Samantha said forcefully. "Lieutenant Torres, wake up."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes fluttered and she groaned.</P>
<P>"Come on," Samantha said gently. She started lifting B’Elanna from the floor.
</P>
<P>The Doctor came out of his office, then saw B’Elanna on the floor and rushed
to her. </P>
<P>He knelt next to the ensign. "Fainted?" he asked Samantha.</P>
<P>"Yep," she said with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Wake her up," Seven said through clenched teeth. She panted as the
contraction gripped her.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna eyes opened.</P>
<P>"Welcome back, Lieutenant," the Doctor said smugly. "Your wife is doing all
the work while you are taking a nap."</P>
<P>"Seven," she said again as she struggled to her feet. The Doctor guided her
to the bed, ready to catch her if she fainted again.</P>
<P>"She turned again," Samantha said as she scanned Seven’s belly. "It looks
like her shoulder is stuck."</P>
<P>"Do something," Seven ordered B’Elanna. "Make your child move."</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked back and forth between Opaca and the Doctor.</P>
<P>Opaca sighed. "Doctor, you monitor the baby. Ensign, you help Seven push, and
B’Elanna, you get back down here and catch your daughter…and I forbid you to
faint."</P>
<P>"Klingons do not faint," B’Elanna muttered as she did what she was told.</P>
<P>"Well, this one does." Opaca yanked B’Elanna into position.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at her wife, too far to touch, then over at Samantha, who
she liked, but didn’t feel close a connection with like she did with others.</P>
<P>"I want Nara," Seven said to Samantha and then groaned as she bared down
against the contraction.</P>
<P>"Okay, I’ll get her," she said as she jogged out to the corridor.</P>
<P>"The shoulder is pressing on the pelvis," the Doctor said grimly.</P>
<P>"What does that mean?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Right now, it’s fine," Opaca assured her. "We’ll see if she turns on her
own, if not, I’ll turn her."</P>
<P>B’Elanna rubbed Seven’s leg, trying to offer support. Nara rushed in with
Samantha and went to Seven’s side.</P>
<P>"I thought I was going to miss the big event," Nara said, taking Seven’s
hand.</P>
<P>"I wish I were missing it." Seven panted as the contraction ended.</P>
<P>"I’m sorry, love." B’Elanna squeezed Seven’s knee, guilt filling her
heart.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at her wife, seeing fear and concern, and shook her head.
"I am not sorry that I am here, Be’nal. I am just…uncomfortable. I love
you."</P>
<P>"I love you," B’Elanna said with a smile.</P>
<P>"Yes, everyone loves everyone," the Doctor said. "Now can we get back to
having this child," he said.</P>
<P>Seven glared at him, then let her eyes drift to the office where he had been
exiled.</P>
<P>"I…I’m sorry. Please, continue the lovefest. Seven, B’Elanna…I love you
both," he said stiffly. His eyes widened. "The child isn’t shifting."</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven groaned and Nara helped her lean forward while Samantha went
around the table to help from the other side.</P>
<P>"What the hell is that?" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>"That’s your daughter head," Opaca said gently. "She’s crowning." Opaca was
standing beside B’Elanna, ready to take over if anything went wrong, and she had
her hands over B’Elanna’s guiding them into place.</P>
<P>"I see her head!" B’Elanna yelled to Seven. "She’s got hair… a lot." She
looked at the head forcing its way into the world, the tiny hairs wet and curly
and dark.</P>
<P>"What color?" Seven asked even as she pushed.</P>
<P>"Dark," B’Elanna said excitedly. Her earlier lightheadedness was gone as soon
as she saw her child coming into the world.</P>
<P>"Put your hand here, on her head. We don’t want her coming too fast," Opaca
placed B’Elanna’s hand onto the baby’s head. While B’Elanna gently held pressure
on the baby, Opaca tested Seven’s skin, deciding she didn’t like what she found.
"Doctor, two ccs of dirsoraline," she said without looking up.</P>
<P>"What’s that?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"It will help relax her even more… make a bit more room for the little one,"
Opaca explained as the Doctor handed her the hypospray. She injected it directly
into the over-stretched skin and the change was immediate as the tightness
lessened.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"What is happening?" Seven asked as she leaned against Nara when the
contraction ended.</P>
<P>The Doctor moved up next to Seven and explained how the drug worked. She
listened halfheartedly as she waited for the next contraction.</P>
<P>"Here comes another one," the Doctor said after a few minutes.</P>
<P>"Seven, I need you to push as hard as you can," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"Umm, Opaca," B’Elanna said. "That may not be a good idea…Borg strength."</P>
<P>"Seven, I need you to push… like you have been," Opaca corrected.</P>
<P>The contraction hit and Seven pushed, but the child refused to move. "It
hurts," Seven said as she kept pushing.</P>
<P>Opaca looked up at the Doctor and he shook his head, frowning. She turned
back to B’Elanna and put her hand over the Klingon’s. "Let me take over," she
said as she eased B’Elanna out of the way. "Seven, stop pushing."</P>
<P>"I would love to," Seven said. "Try telling my body that."</P>
<P>"The contraction is almost over," the Doctor said. "Try not to push,
Seven."</P>
<P>"I’m right here," B’Elanna said as she moved beside Seven and took her hand.
Nara stepped back, but put her hand on the Klingon’s waist. </P>
<P>"Is the baby all right?" Seven asked when the contraction ended.</P>
<P>"She fine," Opaca said. "I just have to move her a little to the side so that
she can come out." Opaca explained. "Just try to relax, it will make it
easier."</P>
<P>"You are going to put your hand….inside me?" Seven asked. "The baby won’t
even fit out of there and now you intend to put your hand up there too?" </P>
<P>"Just take a deep breath and it will be fine," Opaca assured her.</P>
<P>"It will not be fine," Seven said in a panic. "That is a one way canal. It is
intended for beings to leave it…not to crawl up inside there."</P>
<P>"I am not crawling up inside there. It’s just my hand." Opaca took a deep
breath. </P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said as she rubbed her leg. "She has to turn the baby. She
can’t come out the way she is."</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said, fear lacing her tone. She took a deep breath and
closed her eyes. Nara squeezed her hand.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Anything on long range sensors, Mister Kim?" Janeway asked as she stared at
the viewscreen. There were times when space travel was extremely boring. Stars
all looked the same when they flew past at warp speed, beautiful streaks of
white sparkling like rainbows stretching into eternity, but after a few hours of
watching, it tended to lose its charm.</P>
<P>"Nothing out of the ordinary," Harry said from his console.</P>
<P>"Perfect day to sleep in." Chakotay yawned.</P>
<P>"Wonder if B’Elanna would agree to take the bridge and let me sleep in
today?" Janeway asked. "I’ll bet Seven is going crazy being off duty. She never
did like just sitting around doing nothing."</P>
<P>"I’m sure she’ll find something to do," Chakotay said. </P>
<P>"She’s probably coming up with a more efficient diaper as we speak," Janeway
added.</P>
<P>"Borg efficiency takes on motherhood." Chakotay laughed. "Parenting may never
be the same."</P>
<P>"Seven may never be the same," Janeway said as she checked her comm panel for
any interesting reports from the various departments. There were none.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Opaca reached up and pushed the baby’s head. "This is going to feel a little
uncomfortable. I need you to relax."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened, and B’Elanna caressed her cheek, calming her instantly.
"I am ready," Seven said.</P>
<P>Opaca took a deep breath and her matrix flickered as she readjusted her image
output, making her hands smaller before she tried to move the child. "I’m
putting my hand inside, try to relax."</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and inhaled sharply.</P>
<P>"Okay, I’ve got the shoulder," Opaca said. "I’m moving her… there. Now, just
breathe as I come back out. One more contraction should do it."</P>
<P>Seven opened her eyes and looked up at B’Elanna. "I want you to do it," Seven
said. She glanced down at Opaca, locking eyes with her. The hologram smiled and
dipped her head.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded and went back to her position between Seven’s legs. Opaca was
there, encouraging her while Nara took Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"It’s time," the Doctor said, watching the tricorder.</P>
<P>"Nice and steady," Opaca said. "Keep pushing, Seven." She moved her hands and
let B’Elanna take over. "Gentle pressure on the head," she explained. "That’s
it."</P>
<P>Seven leaned forward and squeezed her eyes shut as she pushed.</P>
<P>"She’s coming out," B’Elanna said. "Her head’s out!" </P>
<P>"Hold her head. Guide her as she comes out. Just let it happen," Opaca said
with a smile. Her voice was lyrical, and full of reverence. She moved B’Elanna’s
hands to support the tiny head and then used a bulb syringe to clean her mouth
and nose. The baby coughed and her eyes squeezed shut but she didn’t cry.</P>
<P>"She’s got ridges…on her forehead," B’Elanna said, her voice full of
wonder.</P>
<P>Seven groaned as she fought to keep pushing. Her face was covered with sweat
and she was trembling. "How many?" Seven asked through clinched teeth.</P>
<P>"Four of them…like me." B’Elanna laughed.</P>
<P>"Ease her out," Opaca said even as she put her hands over B’Elanna’s and they
pulled the baby gently. "The shoulders are clear. Seven, you’re doing great."
</P>
<P>"She’s out," B’Elanna said as she held her daughter for the first time. Opaca
made sure that B’Elanna wasn’t going to drop the baby and then leaned away to
grab a cleansing towel.</P>
<P>"Let me see her," Seven said as she collapsed onto Nara. "Why isn’t she
crying? Babies cry when they are born."</P>
<P>"Just a moment," Opaca said. She helped B’Elanna wrap her snugly in a
blanket. "Seven, Klingon babies do not cry when they are born. In battle, a
crying baby would give away your position," she added as she looked down at the
baby. The tiny girl was looking up at B’Elanna with wide eyes, and her spindly
arms were waving in the air.</P>
<P>"She’s beautiful," B’Elanna said as Opaca untangled the cord. She moved
beside the bed, easing past Nara who was trying to get a good look at the baby
as B’Elanna tried to hand her to Seven without stressing the uncut cord. "Our
daughter is beautiful," B’Elanna said as she held the baby out to her wife.</P>
<P>"Be’nal." Seven took the baby and studied her tiny features. She laughed.
"She has a mole just like yours." Seven lifted the squirming bundle and kissed
her cheek. "And her eyes look so blue."</P>
<P>"Seven, you’re not quite done yet," Opaca said from between Seven’s legs. She
reached up and massaged the former drone’s belly. "You still have to deliver the
placenta. One more contraction and then you’ll be done."</P>
<P>"I will comply," she whispered and handed the baby to B’Elanna. The Klingon
couldn’t take her eyes off of the tiny, quiet bundle. </P>
<P>"The contraction is coming," the Doctor said. He turned to B’Elanna and
scanned the baby. "I should examine her…if that’s all right?"</P>
<P>"Can I hold her?" B’Elanna asked without looking up.</P>
<P>"Of course," he said as he continued scanning. "She’s in excellent health."
He smiled and looked at B’Elanna. "She’s beautiful…just like her mothers." He
continued scanning, then frowned but quickly changed his expression before
anyone else noticed.</P>
<P>"Keep pushing," Opaca said as the contraction hit. "That’s it…nice and firm.
Good…"</P>
<P>Seven nodded as she leaned back and sighed.</P>
<P>"There," Opaca said. "Now, you’re done." She turned to the Doctor. "What
about the nanoprobes?"</P>
<P>"They seem to be migrating down the cord and deactivating," he said, studying
the readings. "Now, I need to weigh her… you’ll have to put her on the pediatric
scale over here as soon as we cut the cord," he told B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked as she looked at her wife.</P>
<P>Seven nodded</P>
<P>Opaca reached up and clamped off the cord and then cut it.</P>
<P>"Well, hello there." The Doctor took the baby and she immediately squirmed
and began to fuss. "Just a moment," he said. The baby clinched both of her hands
and let out a cry and began screaming at a level that left no doubt as to the
impressive strength of her lungs. The Doctor frowned and held her at arms’
length as she continued crying. "Lieutenant?"</P>
<P>"Oh… sweet… Kahless!" B’Elanna’s eyes widened.</P>
<P>"I didn’t do anything," the Doctor whined.</P>
<P>"What the hell is happening?" B’Elanna asked as she looked down at her chest.
Two dark spots began forming, one on each side of her chest. Opaca leaned over
and looked.</P>
<P>"Your milk just came down," Opaca informed her. "Klingon’s have an instant
response to a crying child."</P>
<P>"It’s leaking like a warp core breach," she yelled as she stared at the
growing stains. She looked over at the Doctor and her screaming child. </P>
<P>"I didn’t do anything. Why do these children keep crying?" He was holding her
as far away from his body as possible as her screams became more like howls.
</P>
<P>"Give her to me." B’Elanna took the baby and held her to her chest. The baby
quieted down instantly and B’Elanna went back to Seven.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered as the Klingon leaned against the bed. "She is
hungry." She wrapped her arm around B’Elanna’s waist and looked up
expectantly.</P>
<P>"I… well…I don’t know…how," B’Elanna admitted. She looked down at her
daughter who was smacking her lips and sucking on her fist.</P>
<P>"I’ll show you." Nara moved alongside the Klingon.</P>
<P>The Doctor looked on expectantly.</P>
<P>"You, out," B’Elanna said to the Doctor and she pointed to his office. "And I
want a privacy screen up too."</P>
<P>"I am a Doctor, not a voyeur," he said indignantly.</P>
<P>"Out," B’Elanna said. The stains on her gown expanded and she felt milk
running down her belly.</P>
<P>"Fine," the Doctor said as he headed toward his office. "Opaca, may I have a
word with you?" he asked, pausing to pick up the medical tricorder.</P>
<P>"Of course," she said. "Seven, I don’t want you getting up until I clear you,
is that understood?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said without turning around. She was staring at her wife and
daughter and barely heard the hologram’s comment.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway caught her chin before it hit her chest. It wouldn’t do for
the captain to fall asleep on her own bridge. She casually glanced over at
Chakotay; he was fighting to keep his eyelids open. She cleared her throat, and
her First Officer sat up a little straighter.</P>
<P>"Commander, I’ll be in my ready room if you need me," she said as she began
to stand.</P><I>
<P>*"Torres to the bridge…"* </I>B’Elanna said over the comm</P>
<P>Janeway leaned back into her chair and tapped her comm panel. "Lieutenant?"
she asked. "I thought you were off duty?" Janeway smiled.</P><I>
<P>*"Yes, ma’am,"*</I> B’Elanna said<I>. *"Permission to add a name to the
ship’s manifest?"*</I> she asked.</P>
<P>"Who did you have in mind?" Janeway asked. She was curious since Tach and his
family had already been officially added to the ship’s manifest.</P><I>
<P>*"With your permission… I’d like to add Kayla Erin Torres to our manifest,"*
</I>B’Elanna said proudly.</P>
<P>"I think I’m going to need at least a visual inspection before I can approve
that." Kathryn’s eyes sparkled. "Are you near a comm panel?"</P><I>
<P>*"Yes, ma’am,"*</I> B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"On screen," Janeway said as she spun toward Harry Kim.</P>
<P>"Coming in now," Harry said with a huge grin.</P>
<P>"Captain," B’Elanna said as her image filled the screen. She was in the
Doctor’s office, leaning against his desk. "This is Kayla Erin Torres." She held
up the tiny bundle toward the screen. Kayla was sleeping and her fist was
planted firmly in her mouth. Her hair was not as dark as it had first looked
when wet, and B’Elanna stared down at it. It was light brown with red
highlights. She shifted Kayla in her arms and the baby yawned and crinkled her
ridged brow. "Kayla, this is your Captain," she whispered.</P>
<P>"Permission granted," Janeway said, her voice thick with emotion. "But, I
think I need a personal inspection," she added with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Of course," B’Elanna said without looking up.</P>
<P>"How’s Seven?" Janeway asked.</P>
<P>"She’s fine." B’Elanna looked up and smiled. "She’s tired, but fine."</P>
<P>"Is she up for visitors?" Chakotay asked. He was leaning forward, trying to
get a better look at the newest arrival.</P>
<P>"I think Kayla would be thrilled to have some visitors," B’Elanna said. "But
don’t expect Seven to be awake."</P>
<P>"Congratulation, B’Elanna," Kathryn said sincerely.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Tom said from the helm, "She’s beautiful. Tell Seven
congratulations."</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said, looking over her shoulder toward sickbay. "Now, I
have to go. Seven’s ready to go home and I don’t think Opaca understands exactly
how… insistent my wife can be."</P>
<P>"Oh dear," Kathryn said. "Tell Opaca that unless absolutely necessary… she
should not keep Seven in sickbay against her will.</P>
<P>"Gladly," B’Elanna said as she closed the channel.</P>
