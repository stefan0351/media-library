<p>Author's note: Sorry to leave you hanging, folks! Let me warn you now that I'm prone to long periods of fiction dry spells. Sorry for the inconvenience. On to the next chapter!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: If I owned this movie, I might've actually had money on me. But I don't, so...</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><i>Olivia sighed in boredom for the hundredth time that evening. The Debutant Ball was in full swing. Actually 'swing' wouldn't be the word. 'Dangling lifelessy' would have been more accurate. Olivia glared into the plastic champagne glass with apple juice in it to serve as the fake alcohol. Olivia wished it wasn't fake as she downed the stuff. Just a tiny little spike. If she had to act ladylike for another second she was going to..</i></p>
<p><i>"Sorry to break the news to you, but things don't spontaneously combust if you stare at them hard enough." A voice next to her spoke out sarcastically, startling Olivia out of her brood. "I should know, I've already tried." Olivia turned her head and got a good look at the girl speaking to her, seeing a pair of friendly eyes and a warm smile surrounded by chestnut brown hair.</i></p>
<p><i>Olivia felt a faint blush touching her cheeks. "Oh? How disappointing." she responded, smiling easily at this disarming person. "Seems like I've wasted this perfectly good evening testing my will powers."</i></p>
<p><i>"Yeah, that's what happens when you're dragged kicking and screaming to one of these things. All the while your mother advising you to do it in the most ladylike way possible." The other girl grumbled, tugging at her dress irritably. Olivia laughed lightly at that. She held out her hand to the friendly stranger who made her feel comfortable for the first time that night.</i></p>
<p><i>"I'm Olivia Lennox. Pleasure to meet you."</i></p>
<p><i>"Viola Hastings." They shook hands and smiled companionably at each other. "Hey Olivia, you wanna get out of here? I'm starting to get the feeling if we stay here any longer, all the puffiness in this place will come alive and devour our souls." Viola said as she scrunched up her nose as if it might actually happen. </i></p>
<p><i>Olivia giggled and nodded her head. "I would like that."</i></p>
<p><i>"Good." Viola smiled at her and lead her out the room holding her hand all the while...</i></p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</p>
<p>Olivia jerked out of her dream, dazed by the memories she had been reliving. The blond rubbed her eyes and tried to remember what she had been doing.</p>
<p>She had been dozing on her bed, waiting for Viola to stop by to explain herself...</p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</p>
<p>Olivia's eyes widened. Viola! The blond stumbled off the bed and dove for the door, pausing to fix her hair and straighten her clothes before opening it. Viola stood on the other side, dressed as a girl, and with a hungry look in her eyes. The look threw Olivia off-guard.</p>
<p>"V-Viola?"</p>
<p>"Olivia" the other girl practically purrs, sending pleasurable shivers down Olivia's back. Viola smiles a predatory smile and steps closer to Olivia, making her take a step back into the room. Viola kicks the door closed behind her and grabs Olivia by the waist. "Now I can finally have you." Viola whispers as she places her face in the crook of Olivia's neck. The blond girls gasps when she feels the other girl's lips on her neck.</p>
<p>"Viola? W-what are you doing?" Olivia rasps out, Viola's ministrations breaking down her resistance.</p>
<p>"What you've always wanted me to do." Viola mumbles against her skin before flicking her tongue against it. Olivia moans and pulls Viola's head up to kiss her passionately. Olivia buries her hands in Viola's chestnut hair as their tongues met and the exploration began.</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>Viola's hand, burning against Olivia's back, trailed to her front side to go for the gold...</p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK</p>
<p>"GAH!"</p>
<p>Olivia shot up in bed with a loud gasp and sweat beading on her forehead. She looked around her empty room, trying to spot a sex-crazed Viola hiding somewhere. Another dream..?</p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!</p>
<p>The loud and insistent knocking on her door startled Olivia so much she fell out of the bed with a yelp and landed on her backside on the floor. She stood up and rubbed her now sore backside and regarded the door wearily. If this was another dream, she was bound to go crazy. Another loud set of knocks forced Olivia to move to open the door.</p>
<p>Viola stood on the other side, dressed in normal girls clothing, and smiling nervously at Olivia. "What took you so long? Were you sleeping? You look stressed. I could come back later..?" Viola attempted to escape but Olivia grabbed her arm and pulled her back into the room.</p>
<p>"Don't think you can get out of this one, Hastings." Olivia said as she closed the door behind them. She reluctantly let go of Viola's arm and tried to forget her weird dream. Her really hot dream...</p>
<p>"Nice place you got here." Viola said jokingly as she took three strides and ended up on the opposite wall already, snapping the daze Olivia was starting to indulge in.</p>
<p>"I doubt yours is any better." Olivia said, shaking her head of her loose thoughts.</p>
<p>"Actually, I get a super hot roomie who likes to walk around without a top." Viola notices Olivia's blank stare. "In the guy's dorm." she elaborates.</p>
<p>"Oh, right." Olivia breathed a sigh of relief. Then she looked slightly alarmed. "You live in the guy's dorm?" She didn't know if that was better or worse. Viola shrugged and looked slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Lets not talk about that. I'm trying to repress the memories." Viola shuddered.</p>
<p>"Okay." Olivia agreed. Then silence reigned over the room like a thick curtain.</p>
<p>"So..." Viola sighed, shifting her footing. Olivia motioned to the bed.</p>
<p>"Please, sit down."</p>
<p>"Debutante manners never slip, eh?"</p>
<p>"Not even if I drop an anvil on it." Olivia and Viola sat side by side on the bed, Viola folding her legs under her comfortably, Olivia sitting with her back straight. A brief silence.</p>
<p>"So..." Olivia sighed as she glanced at the brunette next to her who was currently biting her thumb nail. "You're a... cross-dresser?" she asked hesitantly. Viola's eyes widened incredulously.</p>
<p>"What? No! Its not like that. Really." Viola stammered, feeling her cheeks burning up. "Its more like a disguise, or going undercover. Or pretending to be my brother to play on Illyria's soccer team."</p>
<p>It's Olivia's turn to look incredulous.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know. It's hard to get at first."</p>
<p>"Why don't you start from the top?" Olivia suggested, composing her features from the bewildered look they had taken on earlier. Viola took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Alright, here it goes..."</p>
<p>Viola then proceeds to explain that the girl's team had been cut, about Justin, about her brother's trip and how Viola was now trying to make a point by beating her ex-boyfriend's team on the soccer field by impersonating her brother and joining Illryia's boy's soccer team. All throughout her rant Olivia remained quiet and still, watching the other girl's super-long story unfold as she acted it out with hand gestures and facial expressions.</p>
<p>"... and now I'm screwed because I know everyone can see through my act, and I only made second string on the soccer team, I stink, and I'm a total loser!" Viola fell back on the bed dramatically and groaned into her hands. Olivia appeared amused.</p>
<p>"Well, you could, uh..." Olivia hesitates when Viola's eyes peek at her from between her fingers. "You could take a shower here."</p>
<p>Viola sits up immediately. "Really?" The hopeful look in her eyes was too much. It took an extra second for the blond girl to find her voice.</p>
<p>"Really." She was immediately enveloped in a strong hug that made her topple over on the bed. Olivia was unable to hold in the gasp that escaped her from surprise.. and other stuff. Viola, who was now on top of her, lifted her head to grin down at Olivia.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Olivia! You're a life saver! Thank you thank you thank you!" Viola chanted as she tightened her arms around Olivia's waist. She didn't seem to notice the dark blush that now invaded Olivia's whole face.</p>
<p>"W-would you mind? You stink." Olivia managed to utter.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry." Viola blushed slightly before pushing herself off the blond. They both sat up again, Olivia attempting to control the uncontrollable blood.</p>
<p>"Okay, so that's one problem solved." Olivia said when she was sure she wasn't as obvious. "What are you going to do about your social status?" she asked, genuinely curious. Viola grinned evilly.</p>
<p>"I already got a plan. Well, actually its my friend Paul's plan but I like to take credit for it." Viola looked slyly to Olivia's intrigued face. "Wanna hear it?"</p>
