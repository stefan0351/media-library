<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Six -->

<p>A few sprinkles fell from the sky just as they left the boathouse en route back to their cabins. Gage insisted on escorting them along the path as the sky cracked with thunder. Derek clung to her as each bolt of lighting flashed across the sky, wind whipping through the air.</p>
		<p>Carrying Dani up the steps onto the porch, Lacy stopped short upon noticing the sliding door ajar. Swirling around, she caught Gage's eyes, joining her on the porch with Derek in her arms. The frightened mother let Dani slide down as Gage stepped in front of her handing Lacy her son. The young mother pushed Dani back away from the door, shielding her.</p>
		<p>"Momma." Derek whimpered, hanging tightly to his mother. Even as the storm raged, an eerie silence surrounded them. Scared, Dani wrapped her arms around her mother, anchoring herself against the unknown danger that swept chills though her body, raising the bumps on her skin. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Stay here." Gage entered the cabin. The dark sky's ambient light from the lingering lightning provided just enough illumination to scan the living room and adjourning kitchen. Gage immediately noticed the broken glass from the three paned front door. A loose shutter whacked the side of the house spurring Gage to practically jump out of her skin. But it was the bedroom door creaking open that persuaded her to take immediate action. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Come on." Her tone brooked no argument. Grabbing Lacy's hand, Gage led her and the kids down the steps along the path to her own cabin. Pushing the back door open, the four piled in just before the heavens opened up with an onslaught of water, light and thunder.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Rain beating down hard on the rooftop as the furious storm raged outside, Gage called the sheriff's department reporting the break-in. Lacy settled the kids on the couch then went in search for a couple of towels. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy reentered the living room to find Derek clinging to Gage on the couch with Dani snuggling close by. A bolt of lightning cast a streak across the room followed by a clap of thunder, jolting Lacy. Calming herself, she asked. "Are they coming?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah. We'll wait here while they check your place." Gage shifted, making room for Lacy to join them. "Sit down."</p>
		<p>Handing Gage a towel to dry Derek, Lacy wrapped the other towel around her chilled daughter rubbing a bit of moisture from her hair and face dry. Dani climbed on her mother's lap leaving a spot between the two adults open, which the actress unconsciously closed. Their arms brushed together sparking welcomed warmth between them carrying a familiar comfort felt by the touch. </p>
		<p>Lacy gaped into green eyes and the soothing feeling she found there converged upon her entire being, seducing her into a sense of complete and utter trust for the woman who had become a necessary ingredient in her family's life. Somehow even in the mist of lurking danger, Lacy felt safe. Comforted by this feeling, the dark haired woman leaned her head on Gage's shoulder as the blonde held the star's son tightly. With Dani in her arms, they waited. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>An hour later, a loud knock jolted the cabin's occupants. "I'll get it." Gage said, handing Derek to his mother. The writer opened the door after the sheriff identified himself. </p>
		<p>Stepping inside with his deputy, Sheriff Baylor, removed his wet hat. "Ms. Ballant?"</p>
		<p>"Please call me Gage." She released his hand then turned to the much younger deputy.</p>
		<p>The tall, light haired deputy claimed her hand, flashing a magnetic smile. "Deputy Simmons. But you can call me Ted." He noticed the sheriff's slight disapproving glance.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The sixty-year-old sheriff grunted. "You're the one that called about the break-in?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. This is my cabin." Pointing to Lacy seated on the couch, she continued. "Mrs. Levine... she's the one that is staying over there."</p>
		<p>Nodding, he directed his attention to Lacy who gave Derek to his sister then stood up. Coming up to stand next to Gage, Lacy welcomed the two officers. </p>
		<p>"Ma'am, we have a few questions and we'll need you to go with us to see if anything is missing." The sheriff informed her.</p>
		<p>Glimpsing the uneasy look forming on Lacy's face, Gage offered an alternative. "Sheriff, we'd be glad to answer any of your questions, but would it be possible for Mrs. Levine to go in the morning. With the weather and.... well....." Gage directed his attention to the two scared children on the couch.</p>
		<p>The sheriff hesitated.
			<i>Damn, I wanted to get this done tonight. </i>The sheriff's frown did not go unnoticed by the deputy. "Sheriff, I'll do it. I could come back by early and go with Mrs. Levine. Take care of the reports and everything." Deputy Simmons betted the sheriff would take up his offer. He knew the Sheriff had plans for his day off.
		</p>
		<p>"You sure? You're off tomorrow." The sheriff questioned, but was silently pleased.</p>
		<p>Throwing the raven-haired star a charismatic smile, the deputy said. "Absolutely, it would be my pleasure."</p>
		<p>Shaking his head at this deputy's relentless flirting ways, the sheriff redirected Ted's attention. "And you're job."</p>
		<p>Donning a serious professional demeanor, the deputy clipped his heels and assured his boss. "Yes, sir."</p>
		<p>"Okay, Mrs. Levine, my deputy will need to get some information." Seeing her nod okay, the sheriff looked at his deputy. "Ted, I'll go seal the door on the cabin that way in the morning you'll know if anything's been disturbed."</p>
		<p>Familiar with the procedure, the deputy nodded, turning his attention to Lacy. "Ma'am?"</p>
		<p>Lacy answered the handsome deputy's questions stating that they had only arrived the day before and knew no one in the area except for Sally Raye, the landlord, who rented her the cabin, and, of course, Gage. She further explained that they had been out all day boating.</p>
		<p>He stated that he would inform Sally about the break in then the deputy provided the results of the search they had conducted earlier. "Other than the broken glass from the front door, we couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. Though, it does look like someone went through your belongings, but we won't know if anything is missing until we check it tomorrow. You know, money or personal effects."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"They didn't get any money. I had my purse with me all day." Lacy supplied, smiling at the young man.</p>
		<p>"Great then." He touched her knee reassuringly and smiled, spawning a jealous glare from Gage. Oblivious to the writer, the deputy offered. "Can I take you to a motel or something.... for tonight?"</p>
		<p>Gage inserted quickly. "They're staying with me." She bolted off the chair, herding him out the door. "I think I heard the sheriff drive up." With a sigh of relief, Gage closed the door, ridding the over zealous officer out of their lives.
			<i>At least until morning then he'll be back... smiling, touching. Great! </i>This jealous thought weighed heavily on Gage's mind.
		</p>
		<p>Rubbing her forehead in deep contemplation, Gage was drawn from her thoughts at the sound of Lacy's soft velvety voice. "Gage, are you sure? We could get a motel room."</p>
		<p>"No!" Gage shouted, reeling her alarmed emotions back in at the idea of them leaving. "I mean, you don't have to....I... I want you to stay. That is if you want."</p>
		<p>"I want to stay." Dani jumped in, somewhat surprised to find she had no desire to leave especially after having been determined not to like the stranger.
			<i>I mean Gage. </i>Wanting to cement her plan, she added. "And Derek does too." She nudged him off her lap toward Gage.
		</p>
		<p>Derek happily complied. He ran to the writer's arms as she swooped him up. An imploring smile sent to his mother capped her decision. Of course, Lacy had no desire to part company with Gage and was easily swayed.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"It's settled then." Lacy contemplated her next thought. "Though we don't have anything to sleep in."</p>
		<p>"Our swimsuits." Dani suggested seriously. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A shared chuckle from Lacy and Gage filled the room. "I think we can come up with something that will do.... at least for tonight."</p>
