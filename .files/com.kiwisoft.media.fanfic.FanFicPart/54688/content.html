<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter Six: The Food Chain -->

<P>B’Elanna looked up at the finished roof and stretched her back.
"<I>Well,"</I> she thought, "<I>if I can’t get back to Voyager, maybe I’ll have
a career as a roofer." </I>She rubbed her shoulder, trying to work out the knot
that had been there for the past two days. She wondered what was taking Seven so
long; she had left over a half-hour earlier to get fresh water. The lake was
only five minutes away.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Seven whispered as she came running up the path from the
lake.</P>
<P>"What is it?" Torres turned and saw that Seven didn’t have any of the water
containers she had left with.</P>
<P>"There are large beasts at the lake, and they are coming this way," Seven
said as she reached B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"Beasts?" B’Elanna didn’t like the sound of that.</P>
<P>"Large creatures, two meters at the shoulder and covered with thick fur. And
they have large horns." Seven’s eyes darted around the camp area looking for
some kind of weapon.</P>
<P>"Oh great," B’Elanna said as she dragged Seven toward the cabin. "Just what
we need, company." She pushed Seven inside and then stood in the doorway.</P>
<P>"We should seal the door. If the creatures see us they will attack the
structure." Seven paced the small room.</P>
<P>"Shhh," Torres said as she looked toward the lake. "Something’s coming." She
watched as the trees along the path shook and a low rumbling sound proceeded
whatever was heading toward the camp.</P>
<P>A large black animal came into view, followed by three white ones. They were
four legged animals, slightly larger than Bison from ancient earth. B’Elanna
studied them as they meandered up the path. Several more broke through the
treeline and wandered around the camp before stopping to graze on the tender
shoots of grass under the trees.</P>
<P>"Get back," Seven whispered. "They are formidable predators. Did you see
their horns?"</P>
<P>Torres smiled and looked out at the grazing animals. They had three horns
down the center of their foreheads, the largest on top and the smallest on the
bottom between the eyes.</P>
<P>"Those are not predators," B’Elanna said as she continued watching the
animals.</P>
<P>"What are they?" Seven asked as she edged toward the door. As a Borg drone
she had little experience with large animals and found them somewhat
intimidating.</P>
<P>"Dinner," Torres said with a feral smile.</P>
<P>"You cannot be serious. Those creatures will eat you alive." Seven pulled
B’Elanna away from the door.</P>
<P>"Seven, those things don’t eat meat. They’re giant cows. You’re looking at a
ton of hamburger on the hoof," B’Elanna said, remembering that Seven had
actually enjoyed Neelix’s version of grilled burgers during <I>Voyager’s</I>
summer barbecue.</P>
<P>"And how do you plan on killing it?" Seven demanded. "Simply walk up to it
and ask it to jump onto a bun?"</P>
<P>"Uhh," B’Elanna looked out at the animals. They moved slowly around the camp,
chewing lazily on the grass looking very much like cows, but their size was
intimidating.</P>
<P>"I see," Seven said and crossed her arms over her chest triumphantly. "Shall
I get the buns?"</P>
<P>"Oh, shut up." Torres flopped onto the floor. She reached over and pulled a
piece of scrap metal over to her and began studying it.</P>
<P>Seven peeked out the door at the ‘cows’ and studied them. Once she knew that
they wouldn’t devour her, she was curious about them. There were at least thirty
of them around the cabin now, in many different shades from black to a creamy
white. </P>
<P>"Lieutenant," Seven whispered, waving her hand to draw Torres over to the
door.</P>
<P>"Seven, can’t you just call me B’Elanna? It’s not like we have a command
structure here," she said as she turned the metal over in her hand.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, come here."</P>
<P>"Fine," Torres said with a sigh and stood. "What is it?"</P>
<P>"There are offspring." Seven pointed at a group of young calves frolicking
around the larger cows. One was a pale reddish blonde and its horns were just
beginning to sprout. "That one resembles Naomi Wildman," Seven said.</P>
<P>"Hey, I could take one of those down with a crude knife," Torres said.</P>
<P>Seven was mortified. "You wouldn’t."</P>
<P>Torres looked at Seven’s horrified face. "Oh, all right. I won’t kill the one
that looks like Naomi, but we need food, and I call this a nice delivery
service."</P>
<P>"Are you certain we must kill them?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Seven, <I>Voyager</I> should have found us by now." Torres stared out at the
herd of animals as she spoke. "We’ve been here almost two weeks, and I don’t
know how much longer the ship will stay around to look for us."</P>
<P>"I have thought of that," Seven said quietly. "Perhaps we should prepare meat
for long term storage."</P>
<P>"I figure we can dry whatever we can’t eat right away," B’Elanna said. "We’ll
put it that large storage area at the back of the cabin. It would help if we had
some dried nuts and grains, too." B’Elanna held the piece of metal out to Seven.
"Think you could use that Borg tubule drill of yours to hone an edge on this for
me?"</P>
<P>Seven took the metal and turned it over slowly. "I believe so, however there
are other alloys at the shuttle that would be more effective. The hull plating
at the front of the shuttle is duranium. It is much harder and will hold a sharp
edge longer. Also, it will be less likely to break off should it strike
bone."</P>
<P>"Can your tubules cut duranium?"</P>
<P>"Of course," Seven said.</P>
<P>"You’re just a regular Swiss Army knife." B’Elanna stood and wandered the
small room.</P>
<P>Seven wasn’t sure what the reference meant, but thought it was a compliment.
"If you mount a duranium point on a spear, you would have a weapon that could
bring down one of the cows."</P>
<P>"I’ll do it. I’ll go out as soon as we have the spears made, and when I… when
I’ve finished, you can help me bring the meat back." </P>
<P>"Is it safe?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Hey, it’s a cow. I’m a Klingon warrior. Do the math."</P>
<P>"Indeed. Perhaps I should accompany you," Seven offered.</P>
<P>"What? And have you naming the rest of the herd? I’ll be fine," B’Elanna
promised. "Maybe you can take the tricorder and find some edible nuts and
fruits."</P>
<P>Seven didn’t seem convinced, but then nodded. "I will give you four hours and
then I will come find you."</P>
<P>"Eight," Torres said.</P>
<P>"Six," Seven countered.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said and then wondered how in the world she was going to
bring down one of the giant animals.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna left the next morning at first light armed with four duranium
spears. She followed the wide path left by the herd and tracked them to a huge
meadow a kilometer from the cabin site. She watched the animals for quite a
while before deciding on a small male that had moved off to a stream to get a
drink. Her first throw hit its mark, cutting through his ribcage and bringing
him down to his knees. She rushed the beast and used a long dagger to slit its
throat and quickly ended its suffering. Seven had surprised B’Elanna with the
dagger the night before. It was an amazing piece of cutlery, the blade as long
as B’Elanna’s forearm, and honed to a razor sharp edge. Any Klingon warrior
would have been proud to carry the blade, and B’Elanna noticed that Seven had
taken the time to carve Klingon symbols into the hardwood handle. The handle was
perfectly balanced and fit B’Elanna’s hand as if she had been born with it. It
was a touching and useful gift, one B’Elanna already cherished. </P>
<P>As she skinned the animal she thought of Seven and how much she had opened up
in the few short weeks. Torres wondered why she had never taken the time on
board <I>Voyager</I> to get to know the complex and beautiful woman.
"<I>Beautiful</I>?" she thought. <I>"Man, I’ve got it bad. I’m gutting an six
hundred pound steer and thinking how beautiful Seven is."</I> She wondered if
her attraction to her companion was obvious, and more importantly, she wondered
if Seven was getting over Captain Janeway.</P>
<P>B’Elanna cut the animal into manageable chunks and then wrapped most of the
meat in the hide. She used some fiber optic cables she had salvaged from the
shuttle to hoist it into a tall tree and out of any scavenger’s path and then
headed back to the cabin with as much meat as she could carry.</P>
<P>She reached camp and was surprised to find Seven still gone. Apparently she
was still out collecting nuts and berries so B’Elanna began cooking a large
piece of meat and smoking the rest. After another three hours, she was beginning
to worry. B’Elanna was torn between being furious and being terrified. She was
pacing when the door to the cabin opened.</P>
<P>"Where have you been?" B’Elanna yelled before the door was even halfway open.
"You scared…" the words froze on her lips when she saw Seven. The blonde was
paler than she had ever seen her and covered in blood.</P>
<P>"I found a predator," Seven said and then collapsed onto her knees. Her
biosuit was torn across the chest with blood seeping through the material. Her
leg had a deep gash and was leaving a trail of blood across the floor.</P>
<P>"Oh, my god." B’Elanna grabbed her and eased to onto the floor. "Where’s the
medical kit?"</P>
<P>Seven looked up at Torres with glazed over eyes. "You are beautiful."</P>
<P>"Yeah, thanks, but where’s the medical kit?" she asked as she tore the
damaged material away. She scanned the room and saw the kit and quickly
retrieved it. "Hold on, Seven. What the hell did you run into?"</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes rolled back into her head and she moaned, struggling to stay
conscious. "It was not a cow," Seven finally said.</P>
<P>"I never should have sent you out alone. This is all my fault." B’Elanna
studied the deep wounds and gave Seven a painkiller, then began gently cleaning
them. "I’m gonna’ have to used the muscular regenerator before I can heal the
skin surface. Hold on."</P>
<P>"It is not your fault. Did you get a cow for dinner?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah, I got a cow. Now if you just hang on, and I’ll cook you up a nice
steak for dinner." Torres frowned when she saw how deep the gash in Seven’s leg
was. The slice reached down to the bone. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, the creature may have followed me." Seven tried to sit up, but
fell back, the painkiller making her dizzy.</P>
<P>"Hold still. Unless you want one leg shorter than the other," Torres said as
she mended the wound. "I’ll take care of whatever did this to you." Inside she
was seething. Whatever had injured Seven was going to die at the end of the
blade Seven had given her the night before.</P>
<P>"Big," Seven whispered, "with… sharp teeth." She passed out.</P>
<P>Torres sighed and finished healing Seven’s wounds. "At least you won’t have
to feel this. Damn it, Seven. You went out to get nuts and berries; leave it you
to hunt down something big with teeth."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Two hours later Seven woke up alone in the cabin. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" She eased herself up and noticed that her biosuit was in shreds.
She stood and walked unsteadily to the door but before she could reach it, it
swung open.</P>
<P>"Seven, how are you feeling?" Torres moved into the room; her arms were
covered in blood, but she appeared to be uninjured.</P>
<P>"Where have you been?" Seven stared at the blood soaked fabric of B’Elanna’s
pants.</P>
<P>"That thing won’t ever hurt you again." B’Elanna went to the small cooking
area and took the pot of hot water off of the fire and began washing her
arms.</P>
<P>"You killed it?" Seven demanded.</P>
<P>"Damn right, I killed it. Used that knife you gave me," Torres smiled up at
Seven who was standing next to her.</P>
<P>"You could have been damaged." Seven grabbed her and began looking for any
sign of injury.</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said with a smile. She picked a piece of flesh off of
her arm and flicked it into the fire. "Yuck."</P>
<P>Seven pulled B’Elanna into a tight embrace. "Do not ever do that again. I
could not… if anything had happened to you…"</P>
<P>"I’m fine," B’Elanna said, but she didn’t pull away. She actually enjoyed the
closeness, and wondered if perhaps Seven returned her blossoming feelings.
"Shh," she whispered as she pulled back and looked at Seven.</P>
<P>Seven reached out and gently touched B’Elanna’s cheek. "B’Elanna?" she
whispered.</P>
<P>"Yes?" B’Elanna answered, her throat gone dry.</P>
<P>"I, may I? Can I…" Seven leaned down until her lips were almost touching
B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"What?" Torres asked in a husky whisper. She was keenly aware of the feeling
of Seven’s body pressed against her, the softness of their breasts molding
together, the strength in the arms enfolding her.</P>
<P>Seven let her lips touch B’Elanna’s instead of answering her. It was a timid,
tentative kiss, but she followed it up with a more aggressive touch, this time
letting her tongue ease out and flicker across B’Elanna’s mouth. B’Elanna moaned
and pulled Seven closer to her and deepened the kiss. She opened her mouth and
welcomed Seven’s exploring tongue. Finally Seven pulled back and gave B’Elanna
an angry glare.</P>
<P>"Don’t ever risk your life like that again," Seven said, but the effect of
her words was greatly diminished by her hands roaming seductively down
B’Elanna’s back.</P>
<P>"I won’t," B’Elanna promised and leaned in for another kiss. After several
long, leisurely kisses, the half-Klingon pulled back again. "Wow."</P>
<P>"Wow, indeed," Seven said and then smiled. Her hands were still moving across
B’Elanna’s back, learning every curve and nuance. </P>
<P>"I, didn’t know you felt, umm, felt the same way I do." B’Elanna reached up
and pushed a strand of hair out of Seven’s eyes.</P>
<P>Seven pinned B’Elanna in her gaze. "B’Elanna, I believe I am beginning to
falling in love with you." Her blue eyes were pale as ice, and showed the
anxiety she was feeling.</P>
<P>"I think I am, too." B’Elanna cleared her throat. "I never expected
this."</P>
<P>"Is it an unwelcome discovery?" Seven asked quietly.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said. "It’s a very welcome discovery. I just don’t know where
we should go from here."</P>
<P>"Perhaps we should…make love," Seven said and smiled coyly at the
half-Klingon.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and eased away from the tall blonde. "I don’t think we
should move quite that fast." She studied Seven, wondering what possessed her to
suggest taking things slowly. B’Elanna couldn’t deny the obvious attraction she
felt for Seven.</P>
<P>Seven stuck out her bottom lip and looked like Naomi Wildman when she was
pouting. "How fast should we move?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked at Seven and shook her head. She couldn’t believe how cute
Seven was when she didn’t get her way, and only a few weeks earlier she couldn’t
stand being in the same room with the woman. Perhaps the sparks between them had
always been from repressed attraction. She knew that was how she and Tom Paris
had initially interacted.</P>
<P>"Seven, have you ever been with anyone?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. "But I am open to new experiences." </P>
<P>"You said you were beginning to fall in love with me, right?" "B’Elanna moved
back toward the cabin door with Seven on her heels.</P>
<P>"Yes." </P>
<P>"Well, your first time should be with someone you <I>are</I> in love with.
Someone who loves you too." B’Elanna took Seven’s hand and kissed her knuckles.
"Let’s see where things go, okay?"</P>
<P>"All right," Seven said and smiled at the way B’Elanna continued to kiss her
knuckles.</P>
<P>"Now, we’ve got a giant cow to drag back here and smoke, and a big toothy
<I>whatever</I> to deal with down by the lake. I think it’s some kind of bear,
but I’ve never seen one with claws that long." She tugged Seven’s hand and
pulled her out the door. "You up to walking?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said. "I have recovered and can assist in the retrieval of the
meat." She walked alongside B’Elanna, not releasing her hand until they reached
the spears lying against a tree. </P>
<P>"Here." B’Elanna handed her one of the longer spears. "Keep your eyes open in
case that bear thing has family."</P>
