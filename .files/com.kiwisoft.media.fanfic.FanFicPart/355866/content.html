<p>"You told me that this device /blocked/ my emotions, yet it feels as though they are more intense," Seven accused. The doctor flinched and finished his scans,</p>
		<p>"How do you mean?"</p>
		<p>"I am hearing voices... accusitory and..." Seven looked down, the static eating at her hearing. "The static won't leave me alone, I can't think. I cannot function efficiently like this." The doctor looked at Seven, whose expression was just this side of tormented.</p>
		<p>"Seven, I don't think that we can put off the surgery." Seven's head shot up and she began backing away.</p>
		<p>"I do not wish to feel!" She realized what she had said and turned to run from Sickbay. The emotions warred with the implant, fighting an impossible battle. Seven lost time and she was in Engineering, standing in front of B'Elanna. The pregnant half-Klingon gazed into her eyes with her own concerned, brown ones, trying to get her to speak. But speech was foreign to Seven at that moment.</p>
		<p>"Seven? Are you okay? What's wrong--oh, my god." B'Elanna stepped back when she saw the malfunction in Seven's facial implants. Seven reacted to the rejection violently, being driven insane by the implant. She tried to claw at her temples, to remove it with her fingers.</p>
		<p>"Help me! Get it out! Please, you're killling me!" Seven cried and within seconds she realized that she had said 'you're' when she meant to say 'it's.' B'Elanna stared, wide-eyed, at the tortured ex-drone.</p>
		<p>"How can I help?" B'Elanna whispered. Seven fell to her knees, her hands still at her temples. B'Elanna gripped her forearms, trying to keep her from damaging herself. Seven was finally struck with the idea that she was Borg and maybe she could solve her own problem.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna dropped Seven's arm when the tubule snaked out from her enhanced hand, but they didn't reach for the half-human woman, but rather Seven herself. Seven screamed as she bore into her own skull with her assimilation tubules. B'Elanna called for the Doctor, but Seven didn't hear it. She passed out, her wrist connected to her face by the thin tubes.</p>
		<p>Seven opened her eyes. The bright lights blurred and she heard the doctor's voice as he cursed. She tried to move, but a hiss sounded in her ear and darkness washed over her again.</p>
		<p>Seven felt the pressure on her hand and she tried to open her eyes. When she realized that they were open, but she couldn't see, she began to panic.</p>
		<p>"Calm down, Seven, or the Doc will make me leave." Seven looked in the direction of B'Elanna's voice.</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant Torres?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah? Don't worry, Seven. I'm right here."</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>"You asked for my help." Seven closed her sightless eyes.</p>
		<p>"Has it been dealt with?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, after the doctor repaired the holes you put in your head and extracted the Borg implants you triggered to resurface, he was able to begin the surgeries to repair your cortical node."</p>
		<p>"How long have I been unconscious?" There was silence for a moment and Seven desperately wished that her eyes worked.</p>
		<p>"You nearly died, Seven. Over and over. Every time you would start to regain consciousness, your implant would try to kill you. You've been fighting for life this whole time. And I don't think you want to know how long."</p>
		<p>"Please?" There was another pause.</p>
		<p>"All right, but don't let the Doc know that I told you." Seven nodded. "You've been down for..." there was a long silence, then B'Elanna continued. "five months."</p>
		<p>Seven didn't know how to respond. Five months? What could have happened in that time? B'Elanna would have given birth, Naomi had celebrated a birthday, as had the captain, Harry Kim and Tuvok.</p>
		<p>"What did you name her?" Seven asked. There was another moment of silence and B'Elanna answered.</p>
		<p>"I named her Mira. For my mother."</p>
		<p>"How is she?"</p>
		<p>"She's healthy. Growing fast." Seven opened her eyes again and sighed. She had been hoping that her blindness was temporary.</p>
		<p>"Accelerated growth is typical amongst Klingon hybrid children," Seven offered.</p>
		<p>"Yeah," B'Elanna said. There was more silence, "Tom and I divorced." Seven felt her heart pound against her chest.</p>
		<p>"My condolences. May I ask why?"</p>
		<p>"We... I... He... I don't really want to talk about it."</p>
		<p>"As you wish."</p>
		<p>"Ah, Lieutenant, why didn't you tell me that our patient was awake? How are you feeling, Seven?" Seven recognised the doctor's voice immediately.</p>
		<p>"I am blind." Everyone was quiet for a moment, then Seven heard the sound of a scanning instrument.</p>
		<p>"It's a temporary side effect of the latest treatment."</p>
		<p>"How temporary?" Seven asked.</p>
		<p>"I'm not sure... I think I should be able to fix it with the next procedure."</p>
		<p>"When shall that be?"</p>
		<p>"Two days from now. You need to recuperate... and catch up. You were out for a while, there." </p>
		<p>"May I leave sickbay?"</p>
		<p>"I don't see why not, as long as you take it easy and let Lieutenant Torres show you around until I can recover your site."</p>
		<p>"That is acceptable with me, but is Lieutenant Torres--"</p>
		<p>"I'm fine with it, Seven. But please, call me B'Elanna. It's what you have been calling me for the past--for a while now." Seven sat up, feeling B'Elanna's hand on her shoulder for support.</p>
		<p>"I do not recall that."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, the Doc said that your memories would be affected." Seven felt the deck meet her feet and she collapsed, the impact jarring her severely.</p>
		<p>"Easy, easy," the Doctor said. "Seven, you haven't walked in a while and you have to take that into consideration. There may be some muscle decay."</p>
		<p>"I believe I have discovered that on my own, Doctor," Seven said, frustrated by her lack of coordination and the doctor's late warning.</p>
		<p>"Don't be snippy, I'm just trying to help." Seven heard the hurt in his voice and tried to soothe his bruised feelings.</p>
		<p>"I am sorry, Doctor. I'm just... frustrated."</p>
		<p>"That's understandable."</p>
		<p>"Shall we go?" B'Elanna asked. Seven nodded and put her arm around B'Elanna's shoulder, noticing that she was much smaller than the last time Seven had... Seven's mind trailed off as the buried memories refused to resurface. 'In time,' she reassured herself as B'Elanna helped her off the floor. They left Sickbay, with B'Elanna helping Seven walk, thought they hadn't discussed where they would go first. 'It will all get better in time.' </p>
