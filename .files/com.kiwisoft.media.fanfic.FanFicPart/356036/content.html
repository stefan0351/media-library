<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Eight -->

<p>Noemí sat in her office, immersed in paperwork and company statistics, when the private line rang. She absently picked it up, her eyes never leaving the pages in front of her. Terri's voice brought her out of her thoughts of numbers and words; she sounded distressed. For the past week and a half, they have talked every day, Terri checking in with her, as agreed with Thomas and Natalie. Still reluctant to move into the house, Terri procrastinated on making a decision for which day she would move. Noemí kept arguing with her every day, on the verge of loosing her patience. "What's up?" She asked, pulling off her thin-frame reading glasses.</p>
		<p>There was some background sound, and Noemí could tell she was outside somewhere. She stood and moved around the desk, stretching her back.</p>
		<p>"I don't know if we should do this, Noemí. I mean, I'm the kind of person who takes her time with everything, and you like things done fast. I don't know if I can deal with you." Terri found another excuse, another silly one.</p>
		<p>Noemí threw her reading glasses down on the desk, and leaned back on the desk with an annoyed sigh, crossing her arms and holding the phone between her ear and shoulder. "Look, Terri, we agreed that you would move in, and every single day of this month, you have been jerking me around about the date that you want to move in." Noemí said in a quiet monotone, sounding very irritated indeed. "Every time I ask you if you want an apartment by yourself then, you say no, when I ask if you prefer to live in my house then, with my company to help you if any problem arises, you say you don't know. </p>
		<p>"Now, today, when I get out of here," She looked at her watch. "In an hour and a half, I'm going to pass by your apartment to pick you up for good. If you're thinking about your child, then you will be ready with your belongings. I am very tired. Do we understand each other, Terri? <i>Also</i>," She said with great emphasis. "I am taking the day off <i>tomorrow</i>, so that <i>we</i> can go to the family doctor, so that he can take a good look at you. You have been avoiding the subject."</p>
		<p>Terri remained silent for a few seconds, and then she said: "Okay, I will be ready." She paused hesitantly. "Can I bring my drawings?" She asked shyly.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile was more like a grimace and pinched the bridge of her nose with her index finger and thumb. <i>This woman is something!</i> "You can bring anything short of bed and chairs." She said huskily. "You won't need any of that any more, you will have anything you want from now on. I promise you that." She had already bought her the most comfortable king-sized canopy bed and installed it herself the same day of the purchase and delivery. Her mother, who had always had the eye for art, had taken charge of the decorations in the room; she decorated it as she saw fit for Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri remained quiet again, but then she said in a low voice: "I'll be ready when you get here. I don't have that much anyway, and the tables and bed belong to the apartment."</p>
		<p>When they hung up, Noemí leaned back on her chair and relaxed, kneading her eyes tiredly. She sighed and reached for the phone. She dialed and René answered on the second ring. "René, let me talk to mom, please." She said after pleasantries.</p>
		<p>"Sure, honey." She said. "Tell me something, when am I going to meet that lovely young woman Natalie talks so much about? The mother of little Anthony's child."</p>
		<p>Noemí chuckled softly. Terri had only been there that first day, and always avoided the subject of returning. Noemí knew that she liked her parents, but that she didn't want to like them too much. "Anthony is hardly a little kid any more." She said. "And I'm trying to get mom to take her somewhere to buy clothes or something. Maybe mom will take you, if you ask her."</p>
		<p>René sounded pleased with that prospect. She put the phone down and minutes later, Natalie came on the phone; she sounded out of breath. "What is the matter, honey? Is something wrong?" Was the first thing she asked; everything in her mind for the past month had been Terri and the baby. Every time Noemí had called, the first few minutes were spent with Noemí reassuring her that Terri was fine, and that all she wanted was to hear her pleasant motherly voice. Today, she'd be giving her good news.</p>
		<p>"Everything is fine." Noemí said with a laugh. "I have good news for you. You should take the things you bought to my house, mom, Terri is finally moving in about two hours, when I pick her up from her apartment. I'm going to see Travis with her tomorrow, I talked to her about that too."</p>
		<p>Natalie sighed with happy relief. "Oh, honey, she has been giving you the runaround for the past few weeks. Are you sure you didn't let your patience run out and rained all over her?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled into the phone. "No, mom." She said in her low voice. "I was perfectly nice, I think. You need to ask <i>her</i>."</p>
		<p>Natalie laughed softly, and they said goodbye. The things would be in the house in half an hour.</p>
		<p>After working for another half-hour, hardly able to concentrate, she stood up and went by the window, looking down at the city. She thought that her solitude would be interrupted, and in a way she felt pleased about that. They still got along fairly, but she welcomed the new company. At times, Terri could be the most pleasant and agreeable individual, but at times she could be irritatingly closed and stubborn. They'd seen each other almost every other night during the past few weeks, Noemí trying to get her to stop the excuses and do what they had agreed she would do. Terri would say okay, and the next day, they would be in ground zero once again.</p>
		<p>Unwilling to work anymore, Noemí stood and walked over to get her jacket from the coat hanger and slipped it on. She stepped outside the office, and stood by her secretary's desk. She sat on the edge and smiled down at her. Her secretary, a pretty dark-haired Hispanic young woman, looked up from the computer with a welcoming smile. "How would you like to take the rest of the day off, Paula?" Noemí asked.</p>
		<p>Paula seemed actually surprised at the offer. She had two children, - a ten year old boy and an eight year old girl- she hardly has time to spend with, working so hard at the office. Her smile to Noemí was bright, and she said in an almost shy tone: "Yes, of course, I'd love to go home and spend time with my kids."</p>
		<p>Noemí stood up straight again, and smiled down at her. "Go ahead, I'm leaving now." She said, and walked away from the desk. The temperature outside felt more pleasant today; the past few days had been unbearably hot and humid. She walked next door to the parking lot, hands shoved into her trouser pockets, whistling softly.</p>
		<p>She drove with her top and the windows down; the much cooler air touches her skin in a sort of caress. Because of the early time in the afternoon, rush hour had not yet set in. There was only a short thirty-minute drive to Terri's apartment, and she arrived more than forty-five minutes earlier than she had said. She sat in her car for a long time, tapping the wheel to the music playing softly from her speakers. She looked up at the window, and decided to come in, in case Terri needed any help. As she reached out to push the door to building, it swung open and Terri stood there, two large boxes behind her.</p>
		<p>Noemí eyed the boxes, and then Terri, a scowl furrowing her brow. "You brought that down by <i>yourself</i>?" She asked in a bewildered tone, pointing at the boxes and looking at Terri as if she had gone crazy.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded and looked at Noemí as if nothing in the world was wrong. "Yes, why?" She said with a shrug.</p>
		<p>Noemí made an exasperated sound. "You're <i>pregnant</i>, Terri," She said almost shrilly. "That is why. I don't know how much you know, but it is dangerous for a pregnant woman to be lifting heavy things. You can cause yourself an abortion." She moved past her and reached for a box. It felt only slightly heavy to her, but to Terri's small frame it must surely have been a lead weight.</p>
		<p>"Is that true?" Terri whispered, grasping her shoulder and stopping her. Noemí could see that she scared her. She did not mean to. Terri's eyes held tears and her face paled. "I don't want to loose my baby, Noemí. Is that true?"</p>
		<p>Noemí propped the box against the doorframe and touched Terri's face softly with a finger. "Yes," She said in a low voice. "You just have to take care of yourself, that's all. You need to relax, you should have waited for me to do it."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and said: "But I saw you drive up, and I saw that you didn't get out of the car, so I thought that meant for me to bring the boxes down to the car myself." She said in a rush, visibly shaking.</p>
		<p>Noemí felt very stupid and she put the box down. She turned to Terri and took her face in her hands, looking into her eyes. "I was early, and I thought I'd give you a little more time before I went charging in." She said in a gentle voice. Then, to her surprise and Terri's, she bent and touched her smooth forehead with her lips. A feeling of tenderness shook her, and she pulled back, embarrassed. She turned and reached for the box again, hiding her blush. "Go get in the car, I'll be right there." She said.</p>
		<p>Terri said nothing and moved past her obediently, getting in the car and looking at her putting the boxes in the car. In less than two minutes, Noemí had both boxes in the back seat. She walked around the back of the car and slipped into the driver's seat. She turned and touched Terri's shoulder gently, and noticed the thin streak of tears on her pale cheeks. "Oh, Terri," She whispered tenderly, and touched her cheek with the backs of her fingers, wiping the tears slowly. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. I can be very brutal sometimes."</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and looked down at her lap. "No, you're right." She said. "It was stupid of me. It's just the thought of loosing my baby terrifies me." She closed her eyes momentarily, and then looked up at Noemí with a shaky smile on her lips. "You know I felt it move again?"</p>
		<p>Noemí was so pleased that she strokes her cheek again and squeezes her shoulder. "Great!" She said, and her smile grows. "Maybe you'll let me feel it move sometime." She continued, and turned on her seat to drive.</p>
		<p>She didn't see the blush covering Terri's cheeks as she drove off.</p>
		<p>"Oh God," Terri breathed to herself as her eyes take in all of the living room. "Its beautiful!" She walked deeper into the room, and looked at the furnishings, at the paintings and family pictures all over the place, at the glass coffee table of intricate design. Her fingers touched and stroked the materials, as if to tell herself that they were all real. She turned to Noemí as she walked in with the second box, her eyes shiny. "I'm going to live here?" She asked in a whisper, not believing it.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled as she put the box down right inside the door. She shrugged and nodded, the material of her shirt stretching across her strong shoulders. "Yes," She said blinking. "You don't like it?"</p>
		<p>Terri blinked. Like it? <i>Like it? This is wonderful, Ms. Leone. Maybe you take it for granted because you've always been rich. But </i>me<i>? I'm a bum from the streets, Ms. Leone, I've never been around such riches, and Anthony didn't even take me out in his beautiful BMW!</i> "I love it." She said in a low voice and continued to look around.</p>
		<p>"Help yourself to anything, Terri. Look around." Noemí said gently. When she saw that Terri didn't move, she walked by her and takes her arm, gently guiding her out of the living room and down one of the halls leading into other areas of the house. There were two doors to the left, and two to the right, there was another one facing them at the end of the hall. Noemí showed her into the first door. The room was large, larger than Terri was accustomed to. In that room stood a large desk cluttered with papers; a black IBM computer and a printer shared the messy space. Full of novels and such, against the wall stood a large bookcase, a copying and faxing machine on a medium sized table to the right. A large window behind the desk gave a beautiful view of the trees that cradle the large house around three sides. "My office, I work here, as you can see by the mess on my desk." Noemí explained with a dry chuckle, Terri couldn't help but be impressed.</p>
		<p>She guided her out of the office and into the hallway again. Opening the first door on the right, she showed her into her own bedroom. The room was a little larger than the first one; painted an off-white color, it looked almost cheerful. Terri noticed that it seemed hardly lived in, as if Noemí didn't ever sleep there. The large bed was neatly made, and it looked as if it hasn't been unmade for a long time. A long mahogany dresser to one side of the bed, shining beautifully with the sunlight, sat right below the pretty bay window. There were pictures in frames on top of it, and brushes and perfumes sat neatly above the surface, as if they hadn't been moved in ages. The closet, right beside the entrance, could be accessed easily if she turned to her right.</p>
		<p>"This is my bedroom," Noemí said softly, and swallowed hard, guiding Terri out of the room too quickly.</p>
		<p>"You hardly use your bedroom." Terri said softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí didn't answer and opened the second door on the left side of the hall. Inside, Noemí had a gym set. A treadmill, bike, a weightlifting set and other assorted exercise materials. A window to the back of the room, like in her office, lights the room with a beautiful glow, shining off the clean metal of the equipment. "My gym," Noemí said, sounding at ease again, and she continued with some levity: "Maybe after the baby is born, you'll want to do exercise." She chuckled as she guided her out of the room. She stopped at the door perpendicular to the gym's door, and opened it. Inside was the largest bathroom Terri had ever seen, she gasped and walked inside, eyeing everything. Noemí came in after her, and took a hold of her arm. "You can look at this later." She said gently, and guided her out and to the last of the doors, pausing and looking at Terri. "This is your room, we can buy a crib later on." She whispered and pushed the door open.</p>
		<p>"Oh wow." Terri breathed softly, taking in everything in the room as she walked in. The bed, nestled below the window, was completely made up with pink quilts and covers. The pillows were plump and brand new, as well as the mattress. The canopy frame, black in color, felt smoothly comforting as she stroked it with shaky fingers, standing on the right side. Looking around the room, she saw thin boxes propped up against the wall on the other side of the bed, a closed tripod leaned beside them also.</p>
		<p>A red box shone beside the boxes and Terri suspected she knew what it was. She walked tentatively around the bed and made her way to the box, heart beating fast. There were drawing notepads on top of the box, more than ten, for sure. Kneeling down, one leg braced beneath her, she removed the pads and placed them on the bed. She unclasped the top and opened it. Paints of all colors, brushes of all sizes, and a palette are inside the large sized box. She pulled out a brush, and stroked the wood handle slowly, then the beautiful soft brush.</p>
		<p>She didn't realize she was crying until a thick tear falls on her wrist, and she jumped as Noemí's hand touched her shoulder gently. She looked up at her. Noemí smiled down at her, and with her gold hair falling over her forehead, almost covering her eyes, she looked so endearing. Terri looked down at the box again, and she tried to control her tears. "This-" She began, but her voice broke. "This is wonderful." She looked at the thin boxes, and she instinctively knew that they were canvases. "This is too much." She shook her head and closed her eyes tightly.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat down on the floor, legs crossed, back resting against the bed. "Well, I think you deserve something from us, don't you?" Noemí said softly, looking down at the oil based colors stacked together inside the box, the brushes lying across the compartment above. She reached over and took one of the brushes and gently stroked the horsehair brush with her long fingers. She smiled at Terri. "You ever paint with oil paint?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"In high school," Terri replied her voice hoarse with suppressed emotion. "They had an art program for painters, and I learned to use them. I only used them in school, since they supplied us with them. When I left home, and ended up in New York, I couldn't afford anything." She stopped and stayed silent, looking down at the brush in her hand, her hair falling over her cheeks from her ever-present ponytail.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled softly, and brushed the hair from her cheeks. "Well, now you have all the time, and all the support in the world to paint what you want." She said and smiled.</p>
		<p>Terri lifted her eyes and looked at her for a long moment. "I want to paint <i>you</i>." She said with a small smile. She saw Noemí as such a mix of emotions and colors; Noemí intrigued her.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile faded and pulled her hand away, clearing her throat. "Why would you want to paint me?" She asked uneasily, looking away.</p>
		<p>"Because," Terri said with a shrug, sitting down and resting her back on the bed like Noemí. "I find you intriguing. I'd like to see what's inside you, and painting you is the only way." If she took the time to associate Noemí with a color, it would be gray. Her emotions were gray, far from happy.</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and made a face, not a face of disgust or anger, but of dismissal. "No, I don't like being painted." She said and stood up, walking to the window. She stared out as if looking for something amongst the trees behind the house, shoving her hands into her trouser pockets. Suddenly, she turned to Terri and said: "You're hungry?" Terri nodded and put her brushes away, a little surprised at Noemí's reaction to her desire to paint her. "Good, I'll order something out. I barely eat here, and I can't cook."</p>
		<p>"I can cook." Terri said, and Noemí smiled as she shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Not tonight, you have to make yourself comfortable." She walked to the door, and lingered there for a few seconds, her hand on the knob as she stared at Terri. "I'll go order the food, then I'll take a shower, and then we can eat." She said in a soft tone, and left Terri to explore her new bedroom.</p>
		<p>Terri sank her fork into a thick piece of rib tip; her mouth watered as she lifted it to her mouth. Chewing, she closed her eyes and moaned with satisfaction. "This is delicious!" She said softly, and opened her eyes to find Noemí staring at her with a smile on her face. They sat at the kitchen table, a bag of Italian food to one side of the table. A big glass of apple juice sat in front of Terri's plate, and she reached for it to wash down the piece of rib. Noemí had turned on only one light in the kitchen, the one right above the table, which reflected a low yellowish light onto the table. Already dark outside, they sat in the house's comfortable silence, only the sound of Terri's eating being heard; the rest of the lights in the house were off. "I have honestly never tasted something this delicious, Noemí." She whispered, embarrassed and blushing. "I'm sorry, I think I'm extremely impressed."</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled and leaned forward. She propped her arms on the table, pushing the barely touched plate of Fettuccini Alfredo aside. She leaned her chin on a hand, and Terri could see the muscles of her arms work through her tight T-shirt. "It is understandable, if you've never experienced anything like this." She said, and played with her fork.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at her plate, and noticed that Noemí didn't touch her plate. "Why didn't you eat?" She asked, and looked at her closely.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat back and looked uncomfortable. "I ate enough today." She answered.</p>
		<p>For the first time, with the help of the shadows that the light had made Terri noticed the hollows under her eyes, the way her cheeks were slightly sunken in. Tall, no less than five feet eleven inches, with broad shoulders and well-defined muscles, Noemí was what her brother was not. She now wore a T-shirt and sweatpants. Her eyes were a strange blue in the dark lighting, yellowish in color. Terri suspected that Noemí didn't eat like she should, but she didn't dare point it out to her.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Noemí stood up from her chair and brought her plate to the sink. "It's almost September," She said as she pushed the food into the electric disposal, her back turned to Terri. "Fall is coming soon, and you'll need some winter clothes. Mom is taking you shopping tomorrow after the doctor, you'll be going with René." She paused.</p>
		<p>"Will you be coming with us?" Terri asked, strangely wanting her company.</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and washed her plate. "No, I'll be seeing Victoria," She said, and placed the plate next to the sink. "I haven't seen her in quite a few days." She turned around to look at Terri, crossing her arms over her chest and smiling.</p>
		<p>"You love each other very much." Terri stated more than asked.</p>
		<p>A smile crossed Noemí's handsome features, and she stared off into space. "She's like my sister. She has been my support system all my life. Can't go without seeing her for a few days." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Terri misconstrued her words, and looked at her in bewilderment. "You're telling me you didn't have a happy childhood? But with those parents-"</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and smiled. "That's not what I said." She corrects her. "We have always been there for each other. And she's kept me sane for the past few years." She bit her lower lip and seemed like she was in deep thought.</p>
		<p>"Why the past few years?" Terri asked, picking up from her words. "What has happened in the past few years that you need her so much?"</p>
		<p>Noemí seemed to loose her temper, and her smile faded as she stared at Terri. "Can't someone need her best friend without something having happened?" She snapped at her, and she ran a hand through her hair. "What is it with you?" She walked out of the kitchen, leaving Terri looking after her as if she were crazy, not knowing what she did wrong. She stood up to pick up the mess.</p>
		<p>When she finished in the kitchen, she walked down the hall and found Noemí sitting on the couch, bent forward, her elbows resting on her knees and a drink in her hand. An open bottle of Jack Daniels sat in front of her on the coffee table and she stared at it fixedly. A scowl pushed down her eyebrows and her hair fell forward onto her forehead in unruly locks. She took a long drink from her glass, grimacing and licking her lips slowly. Terri stood silently, watching her, waiting to see if Noemí would say anything to her. But she remained silent and Terri turned away to walk down the hall. "It's a long story, you know." Noemí whispered hoarsely, and Terri stopped in her tracks. "But I'll never tell you about it."</p>
		<p>Terri looked at the floor, still turned away from her. "I've never had a best friend, Noemí." She said softly, and she knew that in the silent house, Noemí could hear every word she was saying. "I'm sorry if I asked too many questions for your comfort." She continued, and walked down the hall, leaving Noemí alone in the living room.</p>
		<p>Late into the night, she could still feel and hear her walking around the house. To Terri, it was as if there was an unspent energy within her that didn't allow her to sit still, much less sleep. Her light footsteps passed in front of Terri's door and disappeared into the door directly in front of hers. The door closed softly behind her. The gym, Terri figured, and soon heard the muffled sound of the weights and Noemí's grunts of effort. She didn't understand the restlessness within Noemí, and put it out of her mind as she closed her eyes, shifted on her comfortable new bed, and fell asleep with the ease of pregnant women.</p>
		<p>Her arms were bulging, the veins showing, as she pushed the weights up away from her chest. The weights were set at 360 pounds, and she lifted them almost too easily. Three years of practice had left her strong. Since she began therapy three months after the accident, two months after waking up from a coma, she had exercised almost every night, when sleep eluded her. With each lift of the weight, she fought the memories threatening to fill her mind, to drive her to insanity.</p>
		<p>The light film of sweat all over her body comforted her, let her know that she was working hard, and kept her mind from her memories. The clenching of her toned muscles reminded her that she was alive, that she could feel pain. And with this knowledge, she continued for hours, moving from machine to machine.</p>
