<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 46: Perfection -->

<P>B’Elanna yawned and opened her eyes. She was on her back, in bed, and felt
like her breasts were about to literally explode. She carefully rolled to the
side at looked at the clock and was amazed to see that she had slept for almost
six hours. No wonder her breasts were swelling like overripe melons. She sat up
and smiled when she saw a data padd propped up next to the breast pump, knowing
that Seven must have left them for her. She picked up the padd first, touching
the screen as she read her wife’s words.</P>
<P>Be’nal,</P>
<P>I have taken Kayla on a tour of the ship with Kathryn.<BR>Sleep. That is an
order. When you read this, use the pump<BR>and go back to sleep. That is also an
order. <BR>When you are fully rested, you may take a long hot bath.<BR>I left a
bowl of apple blossoms next to the tub. <BR>Do not worry about Kayla, I took
enough milk for several feedings.<BR>We will be home in nine hours. Enjoy your
rest.<BR>I love you.<BR>Your Seven</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<DIR></DIR>
<P>"Kahless, I love that woman," B’Elanna said as she took the breast pump and
began expressing her milk.</P>
<P>When she finished, she decided to go ahead and take her bath. She sank into
the steaming water scented with fresh apple blossoms from Tach’s orchard and
knew that she was in heaven. "Oh, yeah," she whispered. She rested her head on
the back of the tub and after several moments she drifted off to sleep. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven and Kayla walked Kathryn back to her quarters and stayed for quite a
while. It gave Kathryn a chance to feel like she was still a part of her
friend’s life. They made plans to begin their Velocity matches again soon, but
it had been several years since Seven had played so Kathryn promised to go easy
on her.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From there Seven went to check in with Opaca. The hologram had asked her to
stop by for a checkup the next day and Seven decided that going a day early was
a great idea. When she arrived, Opaca and the Doctor were both activated. They
were in his office having a heated argument. The Doctor saw Seven and stopped
talking, then nodded toward her. Opaca came out to meet her.</P>
<P>"Seven, I didn’t expect you until tomorrow," Opaca said with a smile.</P>
<P>"I was out with Kayla and decided that it made more sense to stop by now,"
Seven said as she studied the Doctor. He was sitting at his desk going over a
data padd. "What were you fighting about?"</P>
<P>"A difference of opinion regarding policy," Opaca said. "Now, let’s have a
look at my first delivery." Opaca held out her hands and took Kayla. She was
awake and snuggled into the hologram’s chest and sighed, then let out a
contented squeak. Opaca rubbed her back and laughed. "She’s a little cuddler,
isn’t she?"</P>
<P>"She is most happy when being held," Seven agreed. She walked alongside Opaca
as she took Kayla to the pediatric scale and carefully placed her on it.</P>
<P>"Hmm." Opaca kept her hands near Kayla in case she squirmed. "Seven pounds
fourteen ounces…she’s actually gained two ounces."</P>
<P>"She has only gained two ounces?" Seven asked as she stepped closer. "After
all she has eaten? Is she sick?"</P>
<P>"No, Seven," Opaca said, picking up the baby. "I’m amazed she’s gained any
weight at all. Babies usually lose a bit of weight their first few days." She
put Kayla on the exam table and began scanning her. "She is in excellent
health."</P>
<P>"Good," Seven said and let out a sigh. "I should have brought B’Elanna. I had
no idea this would be so… unnerving."</P>
<P>The Doctor stepped out of his office and cleared his throat. "How is
<I>Voyager’s</I> littlest patient?"</P>
<P>"Fine," Opaca said as she gave him an icy glare. "Now, if you don’t mind, I
need to finish my exam."</P>
<P>"Don’t forget to take blood samples." He crossed his arms over his chest.</P>
<P>"I am a hologram…I don’t forget things," Opaca said. She turned her back on
him.</P>
<P>"Yes…well." He went back to his office. "I was just making a suggestion."</P>
<P>"What is going on?" Seven asked. She grabbed Opaca’s arm. "Are you fighting
about Kayla?"</P>
<P>"Calm down," Opaca said gently. "He wants to take over as her physician now
that she’s born." Opaca used a hypospray to draw a tiny amount of blood. </P>
<P>"No," Seven said as she moved closer to her child. "I forbid it."</P>
<P>"I kinda’ thought you might." Opaca shook her head. "Don’t worry. I’m not
going anywhere. The Doctor needs to be kept in line."</P>
<P>"See that he is," Seven said. Her eyes were hard and cold like a blast of
arctic wind against unprotected skin. "I will not tolerate any missteps on his
part."</P>
<P>"There, all finished. She’s doing great, Seven. I’ll handle him," Opaca
promised.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven said as she picked up Kayla and left. Something about the
exchange bothered her and she again wished that she had brought B’Elanna with
her. </P>
<P>Opaca walked into the Doctor’s office as soon as Seven left. She put the
blood sample on his desk and crossed her arms. "You’re a bastard," she said, her
voice full of disgust. </P>
<P>"I am a hologram," he said. "And Chief Medical Officer." He took the sample
and stood, then went to the console and put the sample into a scanning
device.</P>
<P>"I’m talking to the captain," Opaca said to his back.</P>
<P>"I already have a call in to her." The console beeped and he shook his head
and turned. "She’ll be here in an hour."</P>
<P>"That’s not soon enough." Opaca went back to the exam room. She tapped her
comm badge. "Opaca to Janeway. Captain, I need you in sickbay as soon as
possible."</P><I>
<P>*"I’m in my quarters. I’ll be right there,"*</I> Janeway said over the comm.
<I>*"Janeway out."*</P></I>
<P>"It won’t matter," the Doctor said smugly. </P>
<P>"It will to me." Opaca turned and glared at him. "What happened to you? You
used to care about the crew. You used to be compassionate and genuinely
concerned about people." </P>
<P>"I am following Starfleet regulations." He sighed. "Besides, you have no idea
what I was or wasn’t like before you came along."</P>
<P>She walked away, preferring to stand on the opposite side of the room from
him. "You’re wrong," she whispered sadly as she fidgeted with a hypospray.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna was wearing a thick, fluffy, dark blue robe and kept tugging it
closed at the collar. She paced as she waited for Seven to get back.</P>
<P>"Calm down," Nara said from the couch. "She’ll be home any minute."</P>
<P>"I’ve never been away from Kayla this long," B’Elanna whined. "How am I going
to survive tonight?"</P>
<P>Nara laughed and stood. "I am quite certain your survival tonight will not be
threatened by letting Kayla stay with Tach and I." She wrapped her arm around
the nervous Klingon’s waist. "However… that frisky wife of yours may kill you
off."</P>
<P>"Yeah, but what a way to go." B’Elanna laughed and turned to her friend and
smiled. "Thank you."</P>
<P>"No problem. I would have offered to take her before now, but new mothers are
so fussy." Nara turned when the door hissed open and Seven entered. She was
carrying Kayla and the diaper bag and didn’t see the Narian at first.</P>
<P>"Nara, hello," Seven said happily. "Lana, did you rest?"</P>
<P>"Yes, your wife rested." Nara rolled her eyes. </P>
<P>"How are you, little one?" B’Elanna asked with a huge smile. She took Kayla
from Seven. "Did you have an adventure? Did you meet any new friends?" She
kissed Kayla’s tiny ridges and rocked her in her arms. "Were you good for
mama?"</P>
<P>"She was exceptionally well behaved," Seven said, then frowned. "She did not
cry once. Perhaps she does not like our quarters?"</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she continued kissing the tiny ridges. "She was just
showing off. Did you miss me? Did you miss your SoSoy?" she asked, using the
Klingon word for mommy.</P>
<P>"I am sure she missed her SoSoy," Seven said as she put the diaper bag on the
floor. "I know I did." She went to B’Elanna and hugged her from behind. "I
missed you terribly, Be’nal."</P>
<P>"Okay," Nara said with a disgusted sigh. "Enough mushy stuff. Give me the kid
and I’ll be out of here." She held out her arms expectantly.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked as she squeezed B’Elanna tighter.</P>
<P>B’Elanna wiggled loose and turned to her wife. "I asked Nara to keep Kayla
tonight. I hope that’s all right." B’Elanna looked down at the baby, beginning
to regret the decision herself. "I thought we could use a little…wife time,"
B’Elanna said when she looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at Kayla, kissed her cheeks and then gave B’Elanna a
heartbreaking pout. "Perhaps we could go get her later tonight?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna agreed happily.</P>
<P>"Damn," Nara said and rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Tach bet me that you two wouldn’t be able to stand being away from her the
whole night. You just cost me two foot massages and a back rub." Nara held out
her hands and took Kayla. "Your mommies are big pushovers. You’re not even a
week old and you’ve got them wrapped around your little finger."</P>
<P>"As is should be," B’Elanna said as she pushed her friend out the door.
"Thanks, I’ll call later before I come to get her." </P>
<P>"No hurry," Nara said with a knowing smile. B’Elanna waved to the Narian as
the door shut, and then spun to face Seven. </P>
<P>"Now, my beloved," B’Elanna said with a growl. "You and I have some catching
up to do." She eased the robe off of her shoulders, letting it drop to the floor
revealing her blood-red nightgown. "Take off your clothes," B’Elanna ordered.
Her eyes were fully dilated like the predator she had become. </P>
<P>"I will comply," Seven said with a smile and a raise of one eyebrow. She
began slowly unbuttoning her pale blue blouse, letting her fingers trail across
her own breasts on the way to the lower buttons. Her eyes were locked with
B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"Comply…faster," B’Elanna said as she stalked closer. She was leaning
forward, looking like a panther that had the scent of blood, but she had a
different meal in mind. Her movements were fluid and graceful and focused on
Seven. The Klingon’s lip curled up on one side and she growled. It was a
rumbling, hungry growl that would have scared someone unfamiliar with Klingon
lust. </P>
<P>Seven was very familiar with that particular growl and she reacted instantly.
Her nipples hardened as her cobalt blue eyes dilated and she began backing
toward the bedroom. She loved to prolong B’Elanna’s hunt, to see her toned body
grow tense with passion as her muscles flexed in anticipation and her eyes
glowed with a dangerous flame.</P>
<P>B’Elanna licked her lips and smiled when Seven dropped her blouse to the
floor near the bedroom door. She made her way to the garment as Seven neared the
bed and began removing her bra. B’Elanna picked up the silky blouse, still warm
from Seven’s skin, and held it to her cheek and inhaled the scent. She moaned as
the delicate fragrance of Seven’s soap hit her nostrils.</P>
<P>Seven smirked and tossed her bra at B’Elanna. The Klingon caught it and
smelled it as well. She watched as Seven kicked off her shoes and slowly lowered
her slacks to the floor, now clad only in a pair of peach colored panties. She
lowered the panties and kicked them across the room away from her wife. B’Elanna
growled and tossed aside her wife’s sweetly scented clothes and charged the
willowy blonde. Seven stood her ground, returning B’Elanna’s hungry gaze.
B’Elanna stopped an inch before she reached Seven, then lifted her hands and
cradled her wife’s face with exquisite tenderness and drew her down for a slow,
sensual kiss.</P>
<P>Seven whimpered into her beloved’s mouth as their tongues met. She tried to
wrap her arms around B’Elanna but suddenly she was shoved onto the bed. She
laughed as she hit the mattress and looked up in time to see her wife in midair.
The panther was pouncing on her prey. </P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna said as she landed straddling Seven. Her nightgown had a
slit up one side almost to the hip and her legs were warm against Seven’s bare
skin. She rested a hand on either side of Seven’s head and leaned down and
kissed her with a passion that made the former drone see flashes of light
beneath her closed eyes.</P>
<P>"Yours," Seven agreed when the kiss finally broke. She reached up to touch
her wife’s face, but her wrist was grabbed and pressed into the bedding behind
her head.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna repeated as she pinned Seven in place and began kissing her
neck, letting her lips linger on the velvet skin. Her kisses became gentle bites
as she growled and snarled playfully.</P>
<P>"Always yours, Be’nal. I am yours to take as you wish." Seven knew this game
very well, and she loved it. She loved the power she wielded when she chose to
let her wife have complete control. They both knew that Seven could easily
overpower the Klingon, but giving up that power to the one she loved gave Seven
a sense of complete surrender she couldn’t have anywhere else.</P>
<P>"Hold the headboard," B’Elanna whispered as she nibbled her wife’s ear. She
loved this game too. They took turns being the one in control, and she loved
being on either end of the power-play. "Do not let go until I say you can," she
said with a smile.</P>
<P>Seven wiggled as she scooted up to reach the headboard. She grabbed it with
her hands and looked to B’Elanna expectantly. The Klingon laughed, deep and
rich, and let her weight settle onto her wife’s chest. </P>
<P>"Darling," B’Elanna said as she left fleeting kisses all over Seven’s face.
"You shouldn’t look so…eager… for my attack."</P>
<P>Seven smiled coyly when B’Elanna pulled back. "If what you do to me is an
attack…then the Borg are seriously misinformed."</P>
<P>"Hush," B’Elanna said playfully as she nipped Seven’s collarbone.</P>
<P>"Oh… save me," Seven said in complete Borg monotone. "I am being attacked by
a vicious Klingon warrior. Oh…no…won’t someone save me," she droned on
unemotionally.</P>
<P>"I’ll show you a vicious warrior," B’Elanna said. She growled and moved her
mouth over Seven’s nipple and began a loving assault on the tender bud. Her
mouth was hot and covered the stiffening nipple with gentle command.</P>
<P>"Oh, Lana," Seven cried out and began taking shuddering breaths.</P>
<P>"That’s more like it," B’Elanna said smugly as she pulled back. She let her
hands come to rest over Seven’s breasts, kneading the firm mounds as her mouth
nibbled on the satiny skin of Seven’s throat. "Mine," she said once again.</P>
<P>"I am yours. Mark me," Seven pleaded, lifting her hips into B’Elanna.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s hot breath filled Seven’s ear as she kissed and nibbled. "Where
did a beautiful Borg like you pick up a nasty taste for hickeys?" she asked
wickedly.</P>
<P>"From a nasty Klingon," Seven said. "Now, mark me," she ordered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sat up, her hands still caressing Seven’s breasts, and looked down
at her wife with both eyebrows raised. "I am in charge," B’Elanna pointed out.
She rolled Seven’s nipples between her fingertips to make her point.</P>
<P>"Mark me…please?" Seven tried. She arched her back, wanting to get closer to
her wife but her eyes never broke contact with B’Elanna’s.</P>
<P>"Hmm?" B’Elanna considered the request. She looked down at the rock hard
nipples between her fingers and lost all resolve. She dove onto one nipple and
began sucking as much of the breast into her mouth as she could, moaning as her
tongue flickered across its hard nub.</P>
<P>Seven forgot her request and rolled her head to side and let out her own
growl. She squeezed the headboard, making it creak beneath her fists.</P>
<P>After a few delicious moments, B’Elanna’s mouth migrated to the underside of
Seven’s breast. "Mine," she whispered and then drew the tender flesh into her
mouth. She sucked, drawing the blood to the surface of the skin, sure to leave a
very nice mark.</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven screamed, drawing the word out into a moan.</P>
<P>B’Elanna paused, opening her eyes and meeting Seven’s deep blue gaze. "Did I
hurt you?" she asked, concern filling her voice.</P>
<P>"No." Seven shook her head vigorously. "Do not stop."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled and moved her mouth down to Seven’s ribs and began marking
that tender spot as well.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway tugged at her uniform tunic as she neared sickbay. It was her
day off, and she had been enjoying wearing her loose fitting black slacks and a
tank top. Opaca’s formal request meant whatever the issue was, it was ship’s
business, and that meant she had to be in uniform. </P>
<P>She walked into sickbay and saw Opaca examining a hypospray as if it were a
new exotic lifeform. Across the room, the Doctor was equally interested in a gel
pack. </P>
<P>"I didn’t think holograms quarreled." Janeway put her hands on her hips.</P>
<P>"Only when we have a damn good reason," Opaca said as she turned to face the
captain.</P>
<P>"Captain, this issue doesn’t even involve …her." The Doctor waved his hand at
Opaca. "As Chief Medical Officer…it is my duty to make sure all of the
Federation laws are upheld."</P>
<P>"You’re a pompous ass," Opaca said as she moved toward Janeway. "It is my
business when he starts investigating my patients."</P>
<P>"What investigation?" Janeway asked. She studied Opaca’s expression, the
hologram seemed to be genuinely upset, more than that, she seemed… down right
pissed off. Kathryn sighed, the last thing she needed was another sentient
hologram, and the first step to that was emotional awareness.</P>
<P>"He forced me to take blood samples from Kayla Torres," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"It was necessary…" the Doctor began.</P>
<P>"What the hell are you up to?" Janeway demanded, her eyes flashing. She
stalked over to the Doctor. Her voice was deep and menacing like a mother bear’s
growl.</P>
<P>"Captain, I assure you…it’s completely above board." The Doctor took a step
back. "There are certain… irregularities with the baby. I have to
investigate."</P>
<P>"What kind of irregularities?" Janeway’s voice reached its lowest
register.</P>
<P>"Genetic…" he said as he bumped into a biobed behind him.</P>
<P>"Is she Borg?" Kathryn asked, concern filling her voice.</P>
<P>"No." Opaca moved next to Janeway. "And I told this pompous ass that unless
Kayla was a risk to the ship…it wasn’t any of his business."</P>
<P>"I think you’d better explain this from the beginning," Kathryn said, looking
at Opaca.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s mouth was like a flame on Seven’s belly as she moved down to the
former drone’s hip. She growled and sucked the tender flesh into her mouth, her
hands still kneading Seven’s breasts. B’Elanna sucked as Seven screamed out in
agonizing pleasure, her arms shaking as she clung to the headboard.</P>
<P>"Lana, Lana, Lana," Seven moaned. It was her mantra, and far more sacred than
any ancient chant. Her hips lifted as B’Elanna moved her mouth to the silken
skin of her inner thigh. She drew in a ragged breath as she felt her beloved
Klingon marking her there as well.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna breathed onto Seven’s wet and heated flesh. Her breath sent
shivers through Seven’s body, and B’Elanna paused to watch the tiny bundle of
nerves contract. She blew cool air over Seven’s wetness, smiling when she gasped
in pleasure. "You are mine," B’Elanna whispered and then traced the delicate
pearl with her tongue.</P>
<P>"Lana…please…" Seven’s arms strained against the headboard as she fought to
keep her hands in place. "I need you inside."</P>
<P>"Here?" B’Elanna asked wickedly as she dipped one finger into the wetness.
She teased her wife unmercifully, dipping in and then coming out. </P>
<P>"Yes," Seven said in shaking voice. "Please."</P>
<P>B’Elanna licked her finger and tasted the nectar, closing her eyes to savor
the salty sweetness. "I forgot something," she said with an evil grin.</P>
<P>"You forgot to go inside," Seven yelled.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she climbed back up her wife’s sweat soaked body. "I
forgot to mark…this side." She growled and took the underside of the breast
between her teeth and quickly left a mark to match the opposite side.</P>
<P>Seven groaned in frustration and pleasure. She loved the feeling of her wife
marking her body, but she knew that she would have to wait for what her lower
region craved. By the time B’Elanna had properly marked that side of her body,
Seven was hyperventilating.</P>
<P>"Oh, please, my Lana," Seven pleaded between gasps.</P>
<P>"Is this what you want?" B’Elanna asked as she slid two fingers into the
molten liquid.</P>
<P>"Oh," Seven moaned as her body went rigid. "Yes, more."</P>
<P>B’Elanna happily added a third finger and then let her lips make love to the
quivering bundle of nerves at Seven’s center. She moaned as she felt Seven’s
muscles gripping her. She had missed this wonderful connection with her wife.
Opaca had made them stop this type of lovemaking almost two weeks earlier, and
B’Elanna had been craving it. She drew back her lips and let her tongue make a
lazy pass up the front of her wife’s wetness, her fingers still moving slowly in
and out.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna said before sucking Seven’s center back into her mouth.</P>
<P>"Yes…" Seven promised as her arms flexed against the artificial wood of the
bedframe. She vaguely noticed a creaking sound, and then two loud pops as the
headboard snapped lose from the frame under the boxsprings. Only Seven’s Borg
reflexes kept the headboard from hitting her in the face. She stopped the
massive headboard a few centimeters from her nose and then the head of the bed
fell to the floor with a loud thud.</P>
<P>B’Elanna screamed, and started to lift her mouth from Seven’s wetness.</P>
<P>"Do not stop," Seven yelled. It was not a polite request. It was an order
from one of the few people on board who B’Elanna would obey without question, so
she obeyed. She went back to her delicious task, shifting her weight so that she
wouldn’t roll onto her wife. Seven’s head was now pointing down at a forty-five
degree angle, but she didn’t seem to mind. She tossed the headboard across the
room, not noticing when it hit the closet door hard enough to take a chunk out
of the surface.</P>
<P>"There," Seven breathed when her wife found just the right spot inside.</P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna mumbled as she felt the first quivers inside of Seven. Her
fingers felt the contractions and her own body began to shake in response. "Oh,
god," B’Elanna mumbled, not taking her mouth off of Seven.</P>
<P>The former drone arched her back and then let her body fall onto the tilted
bed. The footboard creaked and fell away from the bed and the mattress hit the
floor with a muffled thump.</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, and fought to keep from laughing, thinking that at least
they were now mostly level. That thought fled her mind when she felt the rush of
moisture as Seven’s muscles spasmed around her fingers and the former Borg
howled. B’Elanna rode out the waves of aftershocks inside, thinking that her
wife howled better than most Klingons.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whispered. Her body continued to shake. She reached down for
her wife and guided her up to her chest.</P>
<P>"I’m here." B’Elanna carefully settled next to her, making sure that her own
sore breasts didn’t press too hard against Seven’s ribs as they snuggled
together on what was left of their bed.</P>
<P>"Wow," Seven said with a sigh. Her face was flushed and she couldn’t stop
smiling. "Wow…"</P>
<P>"Now, you know how I felt," B’Elanna said smugly. She kissed Seven’s breast,
letting her fingers trace circles around the still hardened nipples.</P>
<P>"Wow…"</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and squeeze closer to her wife. "You are fixing the bed."
B’Elanna moved her fingers down and caressed one of the marks on Seven’s side.
</P>
<P>"Do that to me again and I will fix anything you want," Seven said with a
lazy grin.</P>
<P>"Again?" B’Elanna sat up and stared down at her wife.</P>
<P>"Again," Seven said. Her blue eyes burned with an inner spark and she took on
the look of the panther right before B’Elanna’s eyes.</P>
<P>"Don’t expect me to stop if you beg for mercy half way through," B’Elanna
said as she straddled Seven again. Her eyes darkened and she studied her wife’s
naked form.</P>
<P>Seven growled, lifting one corner of her lip into a predator’s snarl.</P>
<P>"Mine," B’Elanna said with a laugh. She collapsed onto Seven and playfully
mauled her neck, slowly becoming more serious as the tickling bites became
lingering kisses.</P>
<P>"Yours…always," Seven said happily.</P>
