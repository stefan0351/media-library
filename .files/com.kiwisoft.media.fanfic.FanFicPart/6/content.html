<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>Willow sat staring out the window at the huge black raven perched in the big
old oak tree behind their townhouse.</p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Yes, she said yes! &lt;&gt; Willow remembered the look on Buffy's face as her
love and soulmate had joyfully agreed to the Joining Ceremony.  If Willow
lived to be a hundred she would always remember the joy etched on her
Slayer's face.</p>

<p>She marveled at how much a simple three-letter word could affect her life.
Just one syllable and her entire life up to now had been validated.  The
raven stared Willow in the eye and nodded in agreement, then flew off as if
on important business.</p>

<p>Willow stood and did a happy little jig around the empty room.  It was
strange how that simple little word wiped away all the heartache and pain of
the past few years.</p>

<p>She stopped her little dance to better remember the moment again: the way
Buffy had slid off her chair and onto her knees so she was face to face with
Willow. The tears of joy streaking down the blonde's face as she repeated
yes over and over again punctuating each word with a kiss.</p>

<p>Willow had no idea how long they'd remained on the floor of the private
dining room in each other's arms as Buffy's playful kisses changed in
nature.  As relief, joy, and comfort were replaced by the craving to become
one with each other.</p>

<p>In fact she didn't remember leaving the restaurant at all.  She knew Mr.
Lipase had found them cuddled together and had called them a cab.  But,
after that it was a blur until they finally reached their bed.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't help the smug smile as she thought of Buffy's first
release-the blonde was always so careful never to lose control for fear that
she would hurt her lover-that first time: she'd lost control.  The young
Witch thought of how wild and free the slayer looked as the climax claimed
her-though, Willow thought blushing, her own release was just as intense.</p>

<p>After that initial wild time they had settled down and made an almost
lethargic kind of love.  The kind that only two lovers with the promise of
tomorrow could make-a slow burn that afterwards left them both peacefully
asleep.</p>

<p>No, Willow couldn't remember much of the night-but what did that matter?</p>

<p> &lt;&gt;Buffy said YES! &lt;&gt;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>In a drab, unimpressive little office deep in the bowels of the Vatican
library a very agitated Priest was frantically punching keys on the computer
facing him.</p>

<p>He was trying to call up the files he'd been in charge of for over five
years.</p>

<p>Panic gripped him when every code he put in failed to produce the
information he requested. The strong grip of fear continued to squeeze him
in a tighter and tighter hold, because he was the one who had claimed that
all the old fragile records needed to be scanned into computer files for
their safety.</p>

<p>He had graduated from MIT with honors after answering God's calling at just
twelve years old, taking his vows at 15; the church had sponsored his
education. The Vatican needed a computer expert and he was it.  Years of
rising in status only as successive computer advancements had increased his
value to the church, struggling to learn the complex politics that governed
life in the Vatican, and now his career was over.</p>

<p>As a last resort he put in his private code that gave him &#34;backdoor&#34; access
to the library's main frame but even accessing the hard drive failed to
produce results.</p>

<p>He just sat in his chair staring at a picture of an intricate Celtic knot
with two interlocking rings superimposed on his computer screen.</p>

<p>The Black Files were missing, no, not missing: gone.  The only copies known
to exist in the world!  The original files were destroyed during the process
of scanning them and because of their content there were just two
computer-generated copies made. One was placed in the mainframe and one on
tape backup-the back-up copy had triggered the virus, which wiped everything
out. Under other circumstances he would have loved to meet the hacker that
had thought up the program and compare notes.  Even in his panicked state of
mind he had to admire the skill and cunning of the faceless hacker.</p>

<p>Frustrated, he finally had to admit failure and shut down his computer
before the virus could damage things further.  It would be weeks before he
would be able to write a &#34;seek and destroy program&#34; to eliminate the virus.</p>

<p>He took an official memo pad out of his desk and wrote his first and
possibly his last note to the Arch-Bishop, &lt;&gt; I'll probably be exiled to
some small parish in the wilds of North Carolina, &lt;&gt; he thought.</p>

<p>It was short note but it carried far-reaching consequences, all it said was:</p>

<p>The Black Files are gone.
Q</p>

<p></p>

<p>With a resigned sigh, and wondering just how hot it got in the American
South, he put the memo into a plastic carrier and put that into the old
fashioned pneumatic tube that went directly to the Arch-Bishop's private
quarters.</p>

<p>&#34;This does not bode well.&#34; he muttered to himself and got up to go pack.</p>

<p>After he left, a tiny light, no bigger than a fly, detached from the wall
and slipped out door to take this news to his master.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>It was late on a moonless night when the private Lear jet landed at the
small airstrip deep inside an undeveloped country in a Central American rain
forest.</p>

<p>A black four-wheel drive vehicle, with dark tinted windows, met the heavily
cloaked passenger.  The cloaked passenger watched the dark countryside
seemingly lost in his own thoughts. The vehicle pulled up in front of
well-maintained but long forgotten stone mansion.</p>

<p>The dark stranger stepped out of the car and went quickly into the house
without waiting for an invitation. The human house servant didn't speak just
signaled that he follow him.</p>

<p>The servant led him too directly to the dimly lit study.</p>

<p>Sitting behind an expansive ironwood desk in a large leather chair was a
huge black skinned demon with glowing red eyes and sharp white teeth.</p>

<p>&#34;It has been a long time my brother,&#34; the demon said in a raspy nails on a
chalk board voice.</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, fortunately. I was told you have a job for me?&#34; the dark figure
answered.  His voice deep and menacing clearly showing his impatience. &#34;I do
not have the time for polite amenities.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Remember your place, Count Kresis!&#34; The demon snapped. &#34;I come directly
from our master and as his messenger I have the power to have you
destroyed.&#34; The demon gloated.</p>

<p>The dark figure threw off his black leather duster revealing the tall dark
haired dark skinned man-like creature.  It was the first time in two days
that he dared remove his coat.</p>

<p>Count Kresis could have passed as human if not for his glowing red eyes,
razor sharp teeth with long needle like fangs, and long extra jointed
fingers that ended in talons.</p>

<p>&#34;Do not threaten me!&#34; he roared grabbing the edge of the desk his talons
sinking into the hardwood. &#34;I am still a Count of the first circle even if I
am exiled in this backward land.&#34;</p>

<p>The black skinned demon cringed back from the count's outburst fear clearly
written on his features. Seeing that he had gotten his point across Kresis
calmed himself.</p>

<p>&#34;Now what does our master wish me to do?&#34; he asked impatiently. &#34; Or more
importantly what's in it for me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The rewards will be quite substantial,&#34; the demon said relieved to be back
on familiar ground. &#34;That plus the master's support in the council on your
petition to return.&#34; He slid a document across the desk.</p>

<p>&#34;Impressive,&#34; Kresis quipped as he read the sheep skin scroll. &#34;Now, for all
this 'generosity' what is expected of me?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;The Slayer and the Sorceress have become aware of their special bond.&#34; The
demon said. &#34;If they complete the joining they will be able to close the
Hellmouth thus thwarting the master's plans to assimilate this world into
his Kingdom.  That  will also strand us all on this dreadful world.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Where are they?&#34; He asked, &#34;and what is required of me? Do I just kill
them?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Yes, you must stop them before the Joining,&#34; the demon said.  Then with an
evil grin he added, &#34;they reside directly over the portal or what the
human's call the Hellmouth.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;This is ridiculous you know I am not allowed enter the area of the
'Hellmouth.'&#34; The count protested, &#34;I'll have to use troops and without me
there in the battle with them it will be difficult.  At least give me some
of the Royal Guard!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;No, the Royal Guard is busy putting down the uprising on Tarsus.  You will
only have the regular troop.  I will not bother the Master again over this
matter.&#34; The demon answered, firmly and finally.</p>

<p>Resigned the count collapsed into an overstuffed easy chair, his heavily
muscled
Seven-foot frame sprawled out casually.</p>

<p>&#34;A troop of second rate demons and vampires against the Chosen One and her
Sorceress who also just happen to Sisters of the Soul.&#34; He sighed, &#34;I hope
our master realizes the impossible task he has set for me. I will do my best
but to be honest I can only work with what I'm given.&#34;</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>He rose and put on his leather duster then bowed slightly to the demon
behind the desk.</p>

<p>&#34;I will strive to follow the commands of our master.&#34; Count Kresis said then
spun and stalked out of the room.</p>

<p>&#34;What do you think?&#34; said a disembodied female voice from the shadows. &#34;Will
he succeed?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;I truly do not know your grace,&#34; the demon said to the provocatively
dressed darkly beautiful female disengaging herself from the shadows. &#34;There
is much aligned against him, he was once considered the greatest general in
the Master's army.  But, without being able to directly lead his troop into
battle-well lets just say fortune favors the brave.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So, in other words he will mount a brilliant campaign and fail.&#34; She
laughed, &#34;I guess the only question is will he live? Oh, well, it won't take
much effort to open another portal and our dear count Kresis is expendable.
Come my pet I hear the inhabitants of this world are quite a delicacy, lets
try some.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;In a moment my dear.  What do you have going on in that pretty little head
of yours?&#34; The demon asked, smiling.</p>

<p>The beautiful demoness laughed again, &#34;oh, nothing really, except wouldn't
it just be delicious if the Slayer and her Witch were persuaded to see
things from our point of view?&#34;</p>

<p>The demon opened his mouth to speak, only nothing would come-the nerve of
her to think she could enslave the Chosen One and the Great Sorceress!</p>

<p>&#34;Darling, close your mouth.&#34; The demoness stated. &#34;They might be The Sisters
of the Soul, but they are still human-I have found that after a millennia of
living in this Hell that all humans have weaknesses.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;So, ss-so, what do you plan, my darling?&#34;</p>

<p>The demoness walked over the desk and peered down, &#34;I don't know yet.  Rest
assured though, I will conquer their will and present them as a gift to our
Master.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;As you wish your grace,&#34; the demon said standing. Smiling wickedly knowing
he would be allowed to feed well tonight, and if his Mistress succeeded in
her plans she would take him back to the Master's court with her.</p>

<p>She stepped to his side and let her taloned finger traced the line of his
jaw over his dry scaly skin.</p>

<p>&#34;Lets go find a human female to play with,&#34; she purred and smiled revealing
two rows of razor sharp teeth and fangs, &#34;before we use her for a late
snack.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Gods I love my job!&#34; The demon sighed, his long forked tongue flicked out
then back.</p>

<p>She laughed maniacally in reply as she led the way out followed closely by
her pet.  She was pleased with her pet he had performed his part well,
Kresis hadn't suspected a thing,</p>
