<!-- New Frontier \ Part 1 -->

<p>Lt. B'Elanna Torres stood in the middle of the living area in her quarters, her hands on her hips and her chest heaving from heavy breathing. She was mad, pissed beyond belief even for a Klingon. It was the last time that she'd ever let her husband of only a few months Tom Paris back in her life ever again.</p>

		<p>She found them, Tom and his new chippy, pawing at each other with their tongues clearly ensconced in each other's mouths. Tom's manhood was out, stiff and raring to go. Her skirt, whoever she was B'Elanna didn't care, was up around her waist and she wore no underwear.</p>

		<p>The fact that she had found them doing that didn't piss her off so much. What pissed her off was that he had brought HER back to their quarters, originally her quarters, and was fucking her on her couch. They didn't even stop when she came in, only invited her to come along.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna calmed her breathing, an amazing feat for her temper that was neither Klingon or human at that point. She counted to three and began speaking in clear, precise terms.</p>

		<p>"Tom, please take this... woman back to her quarters. I do not care if you stay there this evening, but you will not be returning here ever. You will be gone by the time I return from talking to the Captain. You have thirty minutes to clear your things," B'Elanna said, her voice and body stance taking on the qualities stronger than Captain Janeway's force ten demeanor. Said Janeway demeanor could peel the paint off the hull. B'Elanna's new demeanor could remove the duranium from the alloy composing the outer hull.</p>

		<p>She didn't stay to see how they would respond. She merely turned on her booted heel and stomped with purpose out of her quarters to the turbolift.</p>

		<p>"Deck three," she growled. The turbolift began to move and she let go a breath that she knew she had been holding. After she had begun talking, she couldnt breath anymore, especially in his presence. Still, the new breathing was a relief because they were the new breaths of freedom.</p>

		<p>'You are too damn cheezy, girl,' she told herself. 'Freedom! Huh! Whatever. Im still stuck on this damn ship, aren't I? And I'm going to have to see him every single day for the rest of my life no matter if we are married or not.'</p>

		<p>Still, B'Elanna had to admit that it wasn't all that bad being on Voyager. She had been given a new life on this ship and a family that she could largely count on. Her dad had left when she was five and her mom tried to become more Klingon than a mother even though she was a scientist and not a warrior. The woman she was going to see now had shown her more love and respect than her mother and father ever had. She could truly call Captain Kathryn Janeway her friend, and in her private thoughts, mother. She would never tell anyone that, but it was enough that she recognized it.</p>

		<p>The turbolift doors swished open and she walked through, her hands shaking from nervousness. She wanted to scream and cry and hold onto her 'mother' for dear life, but she needed to request for a termination of the marriage before she did anything else. When she saw Janeway on the couch, that plan was shot to hell as she ran into the older woman's arms and began sobbing.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, what's wrong?" Kathryn said soothingly as she stroked her wavy chestnut locks.</p>

		<p>"Tom," B'Elanna chortled, her sobs becoming more wracking in their power. She drooled, her nose ran, tears came from her eyes in sheets. There was no dignity in this process.</p>

		<p>"What did he do, B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Fucked Jennifer."</p>

		<p>"Delaney?"</p>

		<p>"Does it matter?" she wailed.</p>

		<p>"No, I guess it doesn't."</p>

		<p>"I will leave," a cool voice came from a chair near the couch. It was Seven of Nine, the resident ex-Borg, and someone that B'Elanna only tolerated.</p>

		<p>"Maybe you should," Janeway replied. "See you tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am. Lt. Torres, Ensign Paris is a fool," Seven said simply, her voice softened, before she strutted out of the captain's quarters.</p>

		<p>"When did she get here?"</p>

		<p>"We had dinner and a philosophical discussion. Don't worry about her."</p>

		<p>"You think she'd tell anyone."</p>

		<p>"She won't lie but I don't think she'd seek out people to tell. She's not like that. She's got a good heart."</p>

		<p>"I used to think that she was the biggest bitch on board," B'Elanna said, her tears subsiding for a minute. "I'm not so sure anymore. When she was dying, you could really see her fear."</p>

		<p>"I know. I was very scared for her."</p>

		<p>"You scared?"</p>

		<p>"Of course. Everybody gets scared, even crotchety old captains like me."</p>

		<p>"You really love her, don't you?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Are you two together?"</p>

		<p>"No!" Janeway exclaimed. "I mean, she's a beautiful woman, but she's already got a crush on somebody else. I can't compete with that."</p>

		<p>"Who?"</p>

		<p>"I'll never tell, B'Elanna. She told me in the strictest confidence."</p>

		<p>"But you do love her and wouldn't mind if you were with her."</p>

		<p>"I do love her, but I think of her more as my daughter than a possible lover. She's an innocent and I want her to have somebody that can offer her her complete attention. I have the ship."</p>

		<p>"Her?"</p>

		<p>"It's a female, yes."</p>

		<p>"Sam Wildman?"</p>

		<p>"I'm not telling," Janeway said. "You certainly are a little more cheerful than when you came in here."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, gossip does that for me."</p>

		<p>"What did you want to do about Tom?"</p>

		<p>"Divorce him. Truth is that it was over before it began. I just got excited because he included me in his race. I was angry at him for not showing me any time. You know what we had? A week on the Flyer and a week aboard and then he was gone off with Harry or on the Holodeck and then with the Delaney sisters. Kahless, I should have seen it coming. I mean, he wouldn't make love to me after that second week. He must have been fucking her that long."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I'm sorry."</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, it isn't your fault."</p>

		<p>"I should have seen it coming."</p>

		<p>"You had no idea, Captain. I barely had a clue."</p>

		<p>"Computer, what is the location of Ensign Paris?"</p>

		<p>"Ensign Paris is in Ensign Kim's quarters."</p>

		<p>"You can stay here tonight if you don't want to be alone," Janeway said. "I think you should have a good talk with Tom tomorrow, though."</p>

		<p>"I said everything that I needed to before I left."</p>

		<p>"You didn't scream at him, did you?"</p>

		<p>"No. I was actually quite calm. I told him to get out and never come back. But you know Tom, he wants everything he can't have."</p>

		<p>"I know. Do you want me to make sure he understands tomorrow morning?"</p>

		<p>"No. Just serve him with the documents. That's all. I want to wash my hands of him."</p>

		<p>"Okay. Did you want to stay here?"</p>

		<p>"I think so. I'll just sleep on the couch."</p>

		<p>"I'll get you some blankets."</p>

		<p>Janeway patted her back and stood. She got a blanket, a pillow and set of sheets from her closet, only used by Seven of Nine so far in her attempts to sleep. She'd have to sleep someplace else that night.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Seven was disturbed at B'Elanna's state when she entered the captain's quarters. It was the first time that she had ever seen B'Elanna so emotional when it didn't involve anger. She felt sad in her heart that Tom Paris would treat her that way. It was unacceptable. She would have a talk with the Ensign.</p>

		<p>Still, she was happy that B'Elanna and Tom were no longer together. They were not suited well for one another. Tom did not respect B'Elanna. He was always copulating with other females, both holographic and real, and spent more time with his toys than B'Elanna. He often ignored B'Elanna when they were in the same room, even though B'Elanna's whole attention was on him. B'Elanna would definitely be better off with out him.</p>

		<p>Seven found herself in front of Harry Kim's quarters without recognizing how she got there. She had asked the computer where Paris was, and it replied that he was there, but really didn't have any intention of talking to the man that night.</p>

		<p>She rang the chime.</p>

		<p>"Come," came Harry's reply.</p>

		<p>Seven raised an eyebrow and walked into the dimly lit quarters. She could hear ranting and raving coming from the bedroom of Harry's small quarters.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what can I do for you?"</p>

		<p>"I wish to speak with Ensign Paris."</p>

		<p>"He's not doing so well right now. Can it wait until tomorrow?"</p>

		<p>Both eyebrows went up as she considered Harry's question.</p>

		<p>"No, it cannot."</p>

		<p>"Fine, don't be surprised if he starts yelling at you."</p>

		<p>"I am a >big girl.' I can handle it." Harry chuckled at that one before he called Tom into the other room.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what do you want?" Tom asked, his tone less than cordial. Seven noticed that his face was decidedly beet red and his temperature and respiration were elevated.</p>

		<p>"I wish to tell you that what you did to Lt. Torres is unacceptable and if you dare to hurt her or do anything against her wishes again, you will have to answer to me. Understand?"</p>

		<p>"And what would you do, captain's pet?"</p>

		<p>"The punishment shall fit the crime," she said as she turned on her heel and walked out of Harry's quarters.</p>

		<p>"I think you made another enemy."</p>
