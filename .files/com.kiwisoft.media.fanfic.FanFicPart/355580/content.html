<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirteen: Hell, Swallow Me Up Now! -->

<p>***The Palace***</p>
<p>Faith had called Nadia right after school to let her know that she
would be home real late due to working with some people on a school
project. Of course Nadia told her to take her time, schoolwork was
important. It was still kinda weird, Faith thought, to have someone
to report back to. Not like reporting to a watcher, but a parent
like person. Her parents hadn't cared what she did, probably why she
got into so much trouble when she was little. But it was a nice
strange all the same. </p>
<p>Since Sam had disappeared right after school, giving neither Brooke
nor Faith a chance to talk to her, Faith had to follow Brooke to
their house. Which to Faith looked more like a mansion than a
house. Faith parked her bike on the edge of the drive way and
followed Brooke up to and in to the house. Mike and Jane were both
sitting in the kitchen When Brooke and Faith entered to get a snack
for the study session. Brooke took the opportunity to inquire as to
Sam's whereabouts and introduce Faith. "Dad Mom, this is Faith,
she's new to Kennedy and got stuck with Sam and I on a project,
speaking of Ms Houdini seen her?"</p>
<p>"Hello Faith.Sam came flying in the door about an hour ago muttering
something about needed to clean." Jane answered while shaking
Faith's hand. Thinking to herself that Sam and Brooke occupied
themselves with the widest assortment of people she had ever seen.</p>
<p>"Hello Faith, where are you from?" Mike asked, also standing to
shake the girl's hand.</p>
<p>"Nice to meet cha, and I'm originally from Boston." Faith answered,
and was extremely thankful when Brooke pressed a bottle of water into
her hand and then dragged her out of the room. She was never good
with parents, mostly they thought she was a bad influence, and the
fact she never had any she cared to think of as parents, just made
her uncomfortable when meeting them. So normally she steered clear.</p>
<p>Brooke led Faith up the stairs and stopped when she got to Sam's
room, not bothering to knock she opened the door and she and Faith
walked in. They were greeted with a sheirk as Sam noticed their
entry, she was clad in only her pants a scarcely there bra, since she
had decided to change her shirt. She dived into the bathroom and
locked the door before anyone could say anything. Brooke tilted her
head curiously, it wasn't like she had never seen Sam in her bra
before, they were almost sisters, and had had gym together. And she
was sure Faith knew what a girl looked like without a shirt present,
being a girl and all.</p>
<p>"Well that was fun." Faith said smirking.</p>
<p>Brooke smiled at her and motioned for Faith to get comfortable, which
she did, sprawling out on Sam's bed. And Brooke went to the door for
the bathroom and knocked, "um Sam? You ok?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Sam answered, although the squeak in her voice would suggest
otherwise. Finally, with a shirt on, Sam came out of the bathroom.
She was greeted with a smirking Faith, and a confused looking
Brooke. This was not good, not good at all! "Um.hi.welcome to my
room.I guess." Sam muttered to Faith, although she was studying her
shoes. The shy little display, unknowingly, endearing her to
Faith. Sam could look so cute when she was all shy and muttering
like.</p>
<p>"Nice spread." Faith commented, not mentioning the little incident,
which Sam was really, really grateful for. "We should get started,
sooner we're done.well it'll be the sooner were done." Faith said
grinning. She was already itching to go slaying, but at the same
time she was quite comfortable on Sam's bed, where Sam slept, and did.
other things.</p>
<p>"Right teenage hormones, this'll be fun." Brooke said
sarcastically. What with the whole Josh and Harrison things in her
life, she could do without teenage hormones. And so they got down to
work. Faith finding it easy to make Sam blush.which she ended up
doing almost all night.damn teenage hormones.</p>
