<!-- Secret Desires \ Part 1 -->

<p>Sam was going absolutely crazy. Between the extreme sexual
			dreams she was having about her blonde house mate and the steamy day
			dreams that she had been experiencing for the past month, she hadn't
			been able to concentrate on anything. She couldn't remember how
			many times she had to ask her friends and mother:</p>
		<p>"Huh? I'm sorry, what did you say?" And she was frustrated beyond
			belief. So she had decided to write her feelings down, thinking maybe
			that would help. It hadn't, it only served to make her realize the
			helplessness of the situation. She, Samantha McPherson, was falling
			hopelessly in love Brooke McQueen. She continued to write though and
			soon she was writing erotic poems about Brooke. She kept them locked
			away so no one would find them. But just in case anyone did happen to
			stumble upon them, she didn't sign them with her name. She signed
			BrookeAddict . She had already written at least 50 poems, almost all
			of them mentioning Brooke's name.</p>
		<p>After finishing her latest lyricism, Sam sighed with frustration
			and put her head down on her desk in the newspaper office. She
			needed to talk to someone, but was afraid of it getting back to the
			object of her desires. But she was at a loss of what to do. She was
			emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. Her dreams were
			affecting her in ways she couldn't even describe. Her poems started
			becoming a kind of release, but not nearly enough to help though.</p>
		<p>She had started searching the Net for some kind of way to get past
			this little infatuation. That's what she thought it was at first.
			But as time went on she realized it went way beyond that. Then she
			found some sites that were devoted to women who had recently came to
			terms with their sexuality and those had helped a lot with her
			acceptance. But the tension that was thrumming through her body was
			a totally different problem.</p>
		<p>She had found some lesbian porn sites and she couldn't stop
			blushing but couldn't turn away from the sites. Pretty soon, she
			started picturing herself and Brooke in those lewd acts. Very shortly
			after she had to stop looking at the sites for fear she would
			spontaneously combust. Then she found a little thing called fan
			fiction. There were thousands of sites dedicated to all the top TV
			shows and movies. She was amazed at all the people who thought like
			she did. Oh how many times had she thought that the leading female
			characters of her favorite shows were a little to close to merely be
			friends. So she read in all her free time. Some were romantic love
			stories and some were funny. And then some were full of sex. She
			enjoyed them all but the ones that were all about sex were very
			arousing and she started to crave trying all the things she read with
			Brooke. To say her dreams were a whole lot steamier and more vivid
			was an understatement.</p>
		<p>She sat there with her head down, lost in thought, and was
			startled when she felt a hand touch her shoulder. Jumping up, eyes
			wide, she found an amused Lily standing in front of her smiling.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Sam," giggling she went on. " I said your name twice but
			I guess you didn't hear me," she finished with a huge smile. Sam
			smiled in spite of herself. </p>
		<p>"Yeah, you look real sorry," she joked. Lily just laughed and swatted
			her on the arm. </p>
		<p>"So what brings you to my place of proclamation? Got any
			juicy gossip on Satan?" she smiled and pointed at the chair beside
			her "Have a seat, Lil."</p>
		<p>Lily did as requested but looked a little wearily at her friend. </p>
		<p>"Sam is everything OK? You've been a little withdrawn lately and
			you seem a little nervous. You look tired. We have all been a
			worried about you," she finished in a rush.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine, Lily," Sam stood and started collecting her books
			and things. "I just have a lot on my mind." As she was saying this
			she wondered if she should talk to Lily. If she could tell anyone,
			she could definitely tell her. She turned back to face her friend and
			eyed her wearily. Lily could tell Sam wanted to talk and obviously it
			was something huge or she wouldn't think twice about telling her. </p>
		<p>"Lily, I need to talk to you about something," she said as she
			sat back down and put her things on the desk in front of her. As she
			did, a piece of paper fell unnoticed by Sam. She was too busy
			thinking of how she was going to word her next sentence without
			shocking the other girl into a coma. Lily reached down and picked it
			up.</p>
		<p>"What's this?" As she was about to put it on the desk the title
			caught her attention "The Beauty That is Brooke McQueen." She read a
			little further when Sam finally focused on her. Her eyes went wide
			and she jumped up yanking the poem out of Lily's hands. She held the
			poem to her chest her as heart thumped wildly. She was afraid to
			look at Lily, afraid of what she might see. Lily for her part sat
			there dumbfounded. She had not had the chance to read it all but
			from what she read she was very clear on what it was about. Lucky for
			both girls it was one of Sam's mushy poems and not one of her erotic
			ones. </p>
		<p>It got eerily quite with both girls frozen in place. Lily was
			the first to break the silence.</p>
		<p>"So. Ummm. Sam?." She really couldn't think of
			anything to say.
			She just shut up and shook her head. Sam flinched as the deafening
			silence was broken but made no other movement for some long moments.
			Finally she swallowed the large lump in her throat and turned her
			eyes to face the other girl. She saw that Lily was shocked but
			wasn't going anywhere. So she tried to shake off her nervousness. It
			was out now, she had to say something. She just didn't know how or
			where to start.</p>
		<p>"Lily? First, please promise you won't say anything about this
			to anyone?" At Lily's nod and her:</p>
		<p>"Of course Sam," she went on and told her everything. How she
			couldn't get Brooke off of her mind. How she had written many more
			poems like the one Lily had started to read and how she needed do
			something before she went out of her mind with her cravings.</p>
		<p>Lily sat there in stunned silence listening to all Sam had to
			say and she definitely had lots to say. She was surprised but Sam
			needed her right now and she was determined to try and help her best
			friend anyway she could. When Sam finally wound down and got quiet
			again, Lily wanted to say something helpful but nothing came to mind.
			So she decided to just try and comfort Sam and be there.</p>
		<p>"Sam, I really don't know what to say. I wish I could help you but I
			doubt there is anything anyone can do with the exception of Brooke,"
			she gave Sam a small smile and went on. "I will be here for you
			though, anytime you need someone to talk to." She knew it wasn't much
			but hopefully it would ease some of Sam's worries. She was too wound
			up and she was worried about Sam.</p>
		<p>Sam just smiled and thanked Lily for her understanding offer.
			She had to admit she was feeling a little better. She looked at the
			time and realized she was late. It was her turn to watch Mac and her
			Mom was waiting for her.</p>
		<p>"Oh my God, my Mom is going to kill me! She has to be somewhere by 5
			and its 4:30, I have got to go!" She grabbed her stuff not noticing
			when that same poem hit the floor for the second time. "Do you want
			to come over for a little while I baby-sit?" Lily smiled.</p>
		<p>"Sure, let's go." They both headed out of the office and to
			Sam's car, neither giving the poem another thought or realizing how
			everything was about to get carried away. As Sam and Lily were
			heading out the door they bumped into Jason and his sister Shannon,
			who were in charge of the Valentine's Day poem contest. Sam was in
			too much of a hurry so she just spoke over her shoulder on her way
			out the door.</p>
		<p>"Hey guys, the poems that are going in tomorrow's paper are in a
			stack on my desk. Talk to you later." She and Lily both took off in a
			run realizing she was going to be in so much trouble.</p>
		<p>Jason and Shannon just looked at each other and shrugged.</p>
		<p>"Was that blur Sam?" the cute brunette asked and giggled. She
			had always had a little crush on Sam so she didn't mind when Sam
			would ask her to do the little odds and ends for the paper. She was
			still looking at the door thinking about Sam when her brother's voice
			got her attention. Shannon turned to him.</p>
		<p>"Hey what's this?" he picked up the piece of paper and read the
			title. "Ooooh, someone has it bad for Brooke." He read it and
			giggled.</p>
		<p>"You mean besides you and every other guy in this school?"
			She smiled and walked over to him. "Let me see it." She read the
			poem and felt herself get light headed. " Wow, this guy has got a
			gift. I wish someone would write something like that for me. It gave
			me the tingles," she finished with a wistful sigh.</p>
		<p>"You mean like Sam." He laughed then yelped when his sister
			pinched him hard on the arm. "No need to go getting all violent on
			me," he whined while rubbing the sore spot. He eyed his sister
			wearily. "You can't stand there and deny your feelings, anyway, when
			you have admitted them to me."</p>
		<p>"Awww, wimp," she stated and then went on. "Besides, I am not
			denying them. I was just warning you not to tease me again. Anyway
			let's get started so we can get these papers printed and head home."</p>
		<p>She reread the poem and got the same reaction as the first time.</p>
		<p>"This is the best poem I have read in a long time. Let's put this
			one on the first page. This Dream Lover should get us a lot of
			attention. Hey, maybe it will cause a love connection." She laughed
			at her own wit and went to get her work done. Thinking that tomorrow
			was going to be a great day. She wanted to see Brooke's reaction.
			Any girl would love this poem.</p>
