<p>The taste of her filled my mouth - pungent and tangy but sweet at the same time. I could get drunk on just the flavor. My tongue smoothed over and into her folds- her warmth and movements driving me wild for more. She moaned and held me in place- her hands twisting and caressing my hair.</p>
		<p>Her thigh muscles tightened under my hands and I drove two fingers into her and she came hard and fast with a cry to me.</p>
		<p>I had to admit - I loved doing this for her. I loved being the one she cried out for.</p>
		<p>It was an honor to have Liz Parker. As far as I knew the whole town of Roswell wanted their hands on her smooth, sweaty skin.</p>
		<p>And yet somehow she had chosen me.</p>
		<p>I stopped writing, throwing my pen to the floor and shrieking with frustration. It was maddening! I kept having to tell myself it was normal to write about Liz Parker, or rather, my sex fantasies concerning Liz Parker.</p>
		<p>But the more I wrote, the more I liked it. I knew I was just setting myself up for disappointment when the only reason she even talked to me was about Max Evans.</p>
		<p>I jerked at the short tap-ta-tap on the door, then Kyle's face peeking into the room.</p>
		<p>I quickly stuffed my notebook under the bed (along with the Playboys that Kyle never retrieved.)</p>
		<p>"Hey - I heard the noise, what's up?" He came the rest of the way in and sat next to me on his bed.</p>
		<p>Sometimes I think that if I didn't prefer... otherwise... that I might have dated Kyle. I suppose that kind of lowers him on the "most desirable guy" scale - considering I am a lesbian.</p>
		<p>"Oh, nothing." I frowned. "Just upset with something I'm writing."</p>
		<p>"Ah... What you picture in your mind is in disagreement with what flows from your pen?"</p>
		<p>I smiled. "Yeah, something like that."</p>
		<p>"Well, let me read it - maybe I can help."</p>
		<p>I decided to go for it. I figured Kyle would be the most open to this kind of thing, Isabel is such an "all American" I doubted she would tolerate someone so close to her to live an alternative lifestyle.</p>
		<p>"All right..." I say slowly, reaching under the bed, and groping around for my notebook. I wouldn't want to pull out a Playboy instead. "Well, I really don't think it's fit for reading for the general public yet."</p>
		<p>Kyle smiled. "Don't worry, I am not the general public. I'm your friend, and I'm sure it's great."</p>
		<p>His smile looked so convincing that I had to smile back, and hand the notebook to him.</p>
		<p>Kyle took the notebook, and flipped to page one. He looked kind of involuntarily interested, and read each page quickly. His eyes widened, and he had to swallow a few times before he handed it back to me.</p>
		<p>"It's good... very good in fect. Smut - but good smut!" He was talking just to fill the silence now. There was a smile on his face, but a shadow in his eyes.</p>
		<p>"The "I" is me." I said quickly, nervous at what his reaction would be.</p>
		<p>"I thought so. I need to meditate a while on this to be completely at peace with this... change... - but well, can I watch sometime?"</p>
		<p>I colored, heat rising to my face and the back of my neck.</p>
		<p>"Oh - I won't tell anyone! And sure... it might be a little uncomfortable..."</p>
		<p>"It's not that, it's... well, Liz doesn't exactly know my feelings..." I let my voice drop off and turned as far away from Kyle as I possibly could. I did not want to see his face.</p>
		<p>"I think I should leave you to do some meditating of your own for a while." Kyle touched my knee lightly as he walked past and shut the door behind him.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"I--- believe, this is heaven, to no one else but me..." I sang along near the top of my lungs to the radio.</p>
		<p>It was Thursday evening, and after a week of finals, I felt free. It had only been three days since Kyle discovered my secret, but all that had slipped into the back of my mind since I had to study.</p>
		<p>Just above the blaring music I heard the door slam.</p>
		<p>"Kyle," I called, "Wouldja come here a sec?"</p>
		<p>Kyle was grinning. "She likes you." he said, winking at me and turning down the music.</p>
		<p>"Who?" I asked with all the naiveté of a three year old. "Oh.... what?!?! How do *you* know?"</p>
		<p>"I asked her what she thought of you, and do you know what she said?"</p>
		<p>I stared at him. "No..."</p>
		<p>" 'I hate that bitch. I wish she would mover her ass out of Roswell. Not that I'm thinking about her ass or anything.' Then she blushed and ran off."</p>
		<p>I blinked.</p>
		<p>What the hell had *that* been?</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"What did she say?"</p>
		<p>I distinctly heard Liz Parker's voice outside of the Math room door, and decided to stay in.</p>
		<p>"Who?" What... Kyle?</p>
		<p>"Tess Harding, who the hell do you think I mean?"</p>
		<p>"Well... after I asked her what she though of you she said, 'She's cute. If it weren't for that Max guy...' "</p>
		<p>"Really? Oh, I mean, really. Hmmm. That's odd. I'll catch you later, okay Kyle?"</p>
		<p>I opened the door accidentally hitting Kyle in the side.</p>
		<p>"Bastard! I never said that!"</p>
		<p>"You thought it..." Kyle smiled. "And I figured you two might need a little of my help to, well... I was hoping I might get to see that little show before the next millennium."</p>
		<p>I glared at him. "Well, yeah, but what's your point?"</p>
		<p>"She likes you back is my point. Go for it."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Two weeks later I approached Liz after her Crashdown shift. I made sure Maria wasn't there because that sure as hell would have been awkward.</p>
		<p>"Liz." I half-smiled and walked up to her.</p>
		<p>"Hey Tess. Look - I'm kinda busy right now, so maybe we can talk some other time." She gestured to the dining families in the restaurant.</p>
		<p>"You just finished your shift, why can't we talk now?" I had just barely gotten up the guts, and I wasn't going to give up now.</p>
		<p>"Uh... Let me get changed, and you can meet me outside, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Sure." I flashed her a smile.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"I know you like me."</p>
		<p>"What?" Liz looked panicked.</p>
		<p>"And I like you too."</p>
		<p>"Oh..." She looked mostly relieved.</p>
		<p>"Look, you are of the earth, and I am of the sky or whatever, and I don't even know what the hell that means!"</p>
		<p>Liz turned my head to face her, and smiled.</p>
		<p>"Frankly darling, I don't give a damn."</p>
		<p>And she kissed me.</p>
