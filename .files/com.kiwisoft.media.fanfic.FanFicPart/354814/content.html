<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 25 -->

<p>Nicole rolled her eyes as she glanced up from reading her hidden magazine. </p>
<p><i>Could Brooke be any more obvious?</i></p>
<p>She continued watching as Brooke gazed at Sam with an expression that could only be described as smitten. Making sure that the teacher was still pre-occupied with the black board, Nicole ripped out a page from her unused note book and scribbled something on it, before she scrunched it up and threw it at Brooke's head.</p>
<p>Annoyed that somebody had the audacity to interrupt her all important Sam-watching, Brooke picked up the note, making sure that it was well hidden from view. </p>
<p><i>B</i></p>
<p><i>Stop with the Spam gawking! </i></p>
<p><i>What next?! Serenading her in song?</i></p>
<p><i>N</i></p>
<p>Folding up the note and putting it away, Brooke turned around and glared at the sender, who simply smirked and blew her a kiss, before she made herself comfortable and continued with what was fast becoming her favourite past time. </p>
<p>They had returned to school after one of the most emotionally draining weekends Brooke could remember experiencing in a long time. She had spent the night holding Sam in her arms as the brunette cried her eyes out, Brooke doing all she could to comfort Sam as she dealt with the aftermath of her break-up with Alex.</p>
<p>Gazing dreamily at the beauty beside her, Brooke frowned in confusion as Sam began making weird faces at her. Turning her head to the front of the room, Brooke cringed as she realised that she was being spoken too.</p>
<p>"Ms McQueen, I realise that I am not the beauty I once was, but it would be most appreciated if you could keep your attention, and your eyes, focused on me, instead of Ms McPherson sitting beside you".</p>
<p>The teaching entity known as Bio Glass smirked, watching in amusement as Brooke's face turned a bright shade of pink. </p>
<p>"Maybe then you could answer my question".</p>
<p>Brooke sat there horrified, as the entire class shifted in their seats to face her. She didn't dare glance at Sam, though she had no trouble noticing the glare Alex was aiming in her direction. </p>
<p>"What is your question?" she asked, her voice cracking with embarrassment.</p>
<p><i>My god, could I be any more obvious?</i></p>
<p>"As I was repeating myself, twice, before you had the good grace to look my way, would you please inform the rest of your clueless classmates about the functions of a Endoplasmic reticulum and Mitochondrion?" Glass asked, as she glanced around the room, trying to decide who next to pick on. She wasn't expecting the blonde to answer the question, but if she wished to further embarrass herself by displaying her ignorance, who was she to argue? </p>
<p>Brooke sat up and smirked.</p>
<p>"Well, the mitochondrion is the organelle where ATP is formed, and endoplasmic reticulum are channels through which the newly made protein is moved within the cell" Brooke explained casually, without once glancing at the textbooks in front of her.</p>
<p>Everyone just stared.</p>
<p>"Would you like me to continue?" Brooke asked innocently, as the class, minus Alex, began to clap enthusiastically. Casting a shy glance to her right, Brooke blushed as she found Sam grinning widely at her. </p>
<p>"Well done, Brooke" Glass acknowledged finally, her lips twitching in amusement as the cheerleader once again disregarded everything around her by solely focusing on Sam. </p>
<p>She shook her head ruefully.</p>
<p><i>Could the girl be any more obvious?</i></p>

<p>"Hi guys" Sam greeted, as she joined Carmen, Lily and Harrison at their regular table. Sitting down, she stared resignedly at her tray, wondering for the millionth time why she didn't wake up a few minutes early every morning to make her own lunch.</p>
<p>"Anyone want to hazard a guess?" Sam asked, gesturing towards the pile of...something. </p>
<p>"Please cover it up so I don't have to look at it" Lily replied, as she munched on her apple.</p>
<p>Sam smiled, freezing suddenly as Alex walked past, completely ignoring her. Watching after him sadly, Sam missed notice the significant glances exchanged between the other occupants of the table.</p>
<p>"Sam? Are you okay?" Carmen finally asked.</p>
<p>"Not really", she muttered, turning towards them.</p>
<p>"You broke up with him, didn't you?" Carmen replied knowingly, discreetly nudging Harrison who was sitting beside her. </p>
<p>"Carmen!" Lily cried out.</p>
<p>"What?!" Carmen said, defensively. "I was just asking".</p>
<p>"How did you know?" Sam asked, interrupting the Lily and Carmen glare-fest. "Brooke was the only one I told".</p>
<p>"It's not exactly brain surgery, Sam" Lily answered. "It's Thursday, and he hasn't sat with us once this week. He can barely look at you".</p>
<p>"Did you punch him?" Carmen asked, leaning forward in anticipation. She loved good gossip.</p>
<p>"Carmen!" </p>
<p>"What?" Carmen asked, shooting Lily a look. "I was just asking".</p>
<p>"No, I didn't punch him" Sam answered uncomfortably. "Let's not talk about it, okay?"</p>
<p>Lily scooted over, placing an arm around her shoulders. "Is there anything we can do?"</p>
<p>"Thanks, but I'll be fine" Sam replied, before adding with a smile, "Brooke's been taking good care of me".</p>
<p>"Glad to hear it" an amused voice said behind her.</p>
<p>"Well if it isn't Girl Genius" Sam replied happily, turning around. "You might have to sit at our table once everyone realizes how smart you are".</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "Wouldn't be so bad, I'll be sitting with you, wouldn't I?"</p>
<p>"Want to join us?" Sam asked hopefully, preparing to make some room. </p>
<p>"I'd love to but I'm on a most important quest" Brooke answered seriously.</p>
<p>"Where to?" Lily asked with a frown.</p>
<p>"The vending machine" Brooke replied, making everyone laugh.  She looked at Sam. </p>
<p>"Want to join me?"</p>
<p>"Sure" Sam replied with a grin, standing up. "Anyone else want something?"</p>
<p>Shaking their heads in response, Carmen turned to Harrison once they were out of earshot.</p>
<p>"You've been a little quiet" she commented cheekily, punching him lightly on the arm.</p>
<p>"You were right" Harrison replied, with a slight smile. "They were having problems".</p>
<p>"Now is your chance to make a move!" Carmen answered encouragingly</p>
<p>"She broke up with him four days ago" Lily commented wryly. "It's a little too soon, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"You saw her just now" Carmen argued. "She didn't look too distraught to me".</p>
<p>"Ladies, ladies" Harrison interrupted, holding up his hand. "I understand that you two want to play matchmaker, but the decision is mine, is it not?"</p>
<p>They nodded sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Exactly" he replied authoritatively. </p>
<p>He watched them for a moment before he leaned forward. </p>
<p>"Now tell me, what do I do?"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Twelve...thirteen...fourteen...fifteen..."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Brooke asked curiously, glancing at Sam who was leaning against the vending machine.</p>
<p>"Counting how many people are wearing leather today" Sam responded in amusement, happily recalling the snug red leather pants Brooke wore on Saturday night. "You could come to school wearing a garbage bag and it would be the biggest thing since tank tops and neck ties".</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "I never got into that myself. Her c.d is great, but her dress sense..."</p>
<p>"I think it looks pretty hot, actually" Sam admitted with an embarrassed grin.</p>
<p>"Who? Avril in a tie?" Brooke asked in surprise, retrieving her bar of chocolate.</p>
<p>"Not exactly" Sam replied with a laugh, though she did find Avril Lavigne quite sexy, despite herself. "I love that look where someone wears a shirt with their top two or three buttons undone, and they're neck tie is hanging crookedly and they've got that careless look about them". </p>
<p>"What else do you like?" Brooke asked, fascinated.</p>
<p>Sam shrugged casually as she brushed past her.</p>
<p>"Leather".</p>
<p>Brooke grinned as she followed, unaware that a pair of jealous eyes tracked their every move.</p>
