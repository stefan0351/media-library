<!-- Bound \ Chapter 17 - Declarations -->

<P>B'Elanna entered Astrometrics and stared at the shapely behind of the ex-Borg. </P>
<P>Seven had her back to her and was staring at the massive view screen, working on the Meridian - like planet that they were due to investigate in a few days time.</P>
<I>
<P>Seven really has the most stunning figure.</I> </P>
<P>The distracted thought came into B'Elanna's head as she opened her mouth to speak.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, how may I be of assistance? Is there anything I can do to help? Seven still had her back to the Klingon but turned to face her.</P>
<P>"How in Kahless name do you do that? How'd you know it was me?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled at the question.</P>
<P>"You have a unique personal scent, B'Elanna. I would know it anywhere," came the calm reply.</P>
<P>It had the effect of stopping B'Elanna in her tracks. It was an intensely personal thing to say, but she wasn't offended by it, actually, it kind of made her feel warm and tingly. Which brought her back to why she was here in the first place.</P>
<P>"Uh, Seven, I wanted to thank you for helping me out last night. You know, the whole sleepwalking thing." B'Elanna couldn't seem to keep still. She was beginning to feel nervous or agitated or something every time she was this close to Seven, and she wasn't sure how to deal with it. Her agitation didn't improve with Seven coming up and standing so close to her. </P>
<P>B'Elanna began to perspire.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"It was my pleasure, B'Elanna." Who had no idea how much of a pleasure it had been for Seven.</P>
<P>"There was something else, but I can see that you are busy. I'll just leave you to work."</P>
<P>B'Elanna knew that somehow, she was beginning to feel aroused by Seven and all she wanted to do was beat a hasty retreat and try and think things through. She started to turn away, but unexpectedly a warm hand descended on her shoulder, keeping her from leaving.</P>
<P>"I am quite happy to devote my time to you, B'Elanna. What did you want to ask me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked at the words, but that warm hand on her shoulder distracted her. Seven was applying a little pressure and ever so gently was squeezing and massaging her flesh through the thin uniform. B'Elanna felt that she should push the hand away, but it felt so good. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna? You wished to ask me something?" Seven prompted. She knew exactly the effect her gentle caresses were having on the engineer and had no intention of stopping.</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, her throat had gone dry. The tips of Seven's fingers were brushing along the edge of her tee-shirt, barely grazing the skin of her neck. It was driving B'Elanna out of her mind.</P>
<P>"I... um. I er...." She licked her lips, trying to compose herself and noticed that Seven's eyes had zeroed in on her mouth.</P>
<P>B'Elanna knew that she was falling under some sort of spell and shook herself out of it taking a few steps away from Seven. Immediately the contact broke, B'Elanna wanted to feel the warmth of Seven's hand again. But Seven had clasped her hands behind her back in her customary pose, raising her ocular implant.</P>
<P>"I just wanted to know what happened when you took me to bed last night." </P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes at the obvious Freudian slip. </P>
<P>"I...I mean what happened when you returned me to my quarters." B'Elanna desperately corrected herself, hoping that Seven didn't catch the slip.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Seven raised her implant a little higher but responded to the question.</P>
<P>"I returned with you to your quarters and made sure that you did not suffer from another bout of sleepwalking."</P>
<P>"Yes, but the computer said that you were in my quarters for nearly 3 hours. Surely it didn't take that long to make sure I went back to sleep?"</P>
<P>"The Borg are nothing if not thorough." Seven was watching B'Elanna closely.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>For her, last night was almost like a dream come true. She had spent 2 hours and 49 minutes just watching B'Elanna sleep.  She had been content to lie there, occasionally brushing the deep chestnut hair away from the precious face and listening to the sounds that B'Elanna made in her sleep.</P>
<P>"Oh, OK." B'Elanna wanted to leave, but she also needed to stay, to be close to Seven.</P>
<P>"So what did you do all night?"</P>
<P>"I watched you sleep," Seven started to move closer to B'Elanna, who was mesmerised by the intensity of those blue eyes.</P>
<P>"You are very beautiful when you sleep, are you aware of that, B'Elanna?" Seven's breath was warm and sweet on B'Elanna's face, she was that close.</P>
<P>B'Elanna shook her head mutely, she could barely breathe.</P>
<P>"You make small sounds as you breathe and sometimes you reached out for something in the night. What were you reaching for, B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>"I don't know." B'Elanna voice was barely above a whisper.</P>
<P>"Yes you do. You know what you want." Seven lowered her head slightly, her eyes fastened on the dark brown ones of her lover, not breaking contact.</P>
<I><P>She's about to kiss me</I>. The thought echoed in her head, breaking the spell. She wasn't ready for this.</P>
<P>B'Elanna pushed Seven away, but not roughly. She was scared. What is happening to me? Why do I feel this way about Seven. We've only just become friends for Kahless sake. In her hearts, B'Elanna knew that they were much more than just friends.</P>
<P>"Seven, what is happening to me? What are you doing?" The Klingon ran her hands through her hair, she couldn't think straight.</P>
<P>Seven's heart was pounding. Perhaps she had been in error to try for too much too soon. She knew that the emotions and feelings were still there. She would just have to bide her time with B'Elanna.</P>
<P>She walked up to the pacing and clearly upset engineer and placed her hands on the shorter woman's shoulders, stilling her. This time, there was nothing sexual about the touch, only comfort.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, look at me. I want you to understand something." B'Elanna stood still, but would not meet Seven's gaze. The Borg placed her hand under B'Elanna's chin and gently tilted her head until their eyes met and locked.</P>
<P>" I have told you that I am willing to give you anything. B'Elanna, you have been my best, my only friend. There's nothing like the joy that you bring. I wonder what would happen, if you would trust in me. I'll make you believe, I'll make you see, there's no need to run from me."</P>
<P>There were tears in Seven's eyes as she tried to show how much B'Elanna meant to her.</P>
<P>I know that you've been hurt before, let me heal your pain. I won't ever let you hurt anymore. Whatever it takes to make you happy, whatever it takes to make you smile, whatever it takes to make you feel good, B'Elanna, I will be there for you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked her tears away and shook her head slightly.</P>
<P>"Seven, I can't deal with this right now. I need ...." She trailed off not really knowing what she needed.</P>
<P>"I..., I have to go." </P>
<P>The confused woman stumbled away, her mind trying to grasp all that had just taken place.</P>
<P>Seven stood alone in Astrometrics, wondering again if she had given B'Elanna more than she could handle. She thought again of the conversation that had taken place with the Captain and the promise she had made to B'Elanna while she was still unconscious in sickbay. She said the words out loud to remind herself.</P>
<P>"I will not give up on you B'Elanna. I will not give up on us."</P>
<P>Seven took courage from those words.</P>
