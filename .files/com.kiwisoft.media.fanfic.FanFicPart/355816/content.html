<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ Our Hero Bares His Nerves -->

<p>We walked for a little while in the park in silence, Eddie, whose leash I had the job of holding, stopping every few feet to leave his calling card. I've figured out his game, though. You see, he acts very brave and daring when he's just around us. But the second a German shepherd comes over to cover Eddie's trail with his own, Dad's little pooch turns tail and cowers.</p>

		<p>He just PRETENDS to be brave.</p>

		<p>Much like me, when I pause to consider. When he's comfortable, he's confident and will stare at Frasier until my brother's face turns blue with yelling. But beyond his comfort zone, he's scared. I suppose that would do a fine job of explaining why I ran back to Maris all those times.</p>

		<p>Oh, good Lord. I'm comparing myself to a dog.</p>

		<p>I wonder if all these similarities mean that I, too, am like that fourth, least-known Beatle, the one that always seems to fade into the background when compared to the others? I don't know why!</p>

		<p>I'm stalling. Must say something. "Oh, Daphne, isn't that a lovely tree? A dogwood. Dogwoods are actually in the Cornaceae family, you know, but this one is a Pacific dogwood, which would make it Cornaceae nutal --" I stopped myself. I have a tendency to ramble on ridiculous topics when I'm nervous; she was looking at me like I'd gone mad. Wonderful beginning. I took a deep breath. "Daphne, there's something very particular I'd like to talk to you about."</p>

		<p>She stopped in her tracks and turned toward me anxiously. "Yes?" She looked a bit like she had on the balcony that night.... The night I asked her to return Mel's Christmas present.</p>

		<p>Another deep breath. "I've been thinking --" I paused and looked at the ground as I ran my hand through my hair nervously. What if I was wrong? What if this was the last thing in the world she wanted to hear?</p>

		<p>"Yes?" Her expression was still anxious and expectant.</p>

		<p>I pushed it out. "I've been thinking about your visions, Daphne, and I think they're very important."</p>

		<p>She looked down. "Oh." She sounded almost disappointed.</p>

		<p>"No, no, Daphne, come sit down," I quickly cut in, leading her toward a wooden bench. So great was my urgency that I didn't even dust it off. Imagine! "Daphne." I took one of her hands in mine, Eddie's leash looped around one of my wrists, and looked into her eyes. She looked -- dare I pray -- hopeful. I took a deep breath. "I don't think you should marry Donny."</p>

		<p>She didn't looked angry. She didn't look confused. She looked as though she'd expected it. She was smiling. Just slightly, at the corners of her mouth. "Oh you don't, do you?"</p>

		<p>I shook my head. "No. I don't. In my psychological opinion --"</p>

		<p>Her face suddenly clouded. "In your what?"</p>

		<p>I was breathing rapidly now, my nerves firing. I rushed through what I had to say mechanically. "In my psychological opinion, your visions are a clear sign that you are not prepared to commit to him now and probably never will be. A child represents a... a permanent bond, more real than marriage, even, and your reaction to that-- You weren't only uncomfortable, you were terrified. Daphne, you can't hide from me. I know you. You meant what you started to say. The pregnancy only scared you because you're not sure if Donny's right for you. And Daphne, if you're not sure now, three weeks from your wedding, then he's not. I've never claimed to know what makes you happy, Daphne, but I do know when you're happy, and I could see last night --" I looked up at her. "I just want you to be happy. And I'm not convinced that he is able to give you that." I was revealing more of myself in that than I'd ever revealed to her. And it terrified me.</p>

		<p>She smiled a bit shyly. "Are you sure you don't have an ulterior motive behind this little speech, Doctor Crane?"</p>

		<p>I blinked. Again. A third time. Opened my mouth. Closed it. Opened it again. I felt like little Michael Banks in Mary Poppins, when he's told that he resembles a codfish.</p>

		<p>Finally, I worked up the courage to say it. I had it prepared. It was short and to the point: "Yes, Daphne. I'm saying this because I'm in love with you, and I have been for seven years. Marry me." But before I could say a word of it, a familiar short, stocky figure ran up to us. "Daph!" Donny called. "Thank God I found you!" She stood up, a shocked expression on her face, as he hugged her.</p>

		<p>"Donny," she said. I myself didn't acknowledge him, but he didn't acknowledge me, either.</p>

		<p>He was panting a bit. He looked happy and terrified at once. "Daph, why didn't you tell me?"</p>

		<p>She wrinkled her brow a bit and spoke nervously. "Tell you what, exactly?"</p>

		<p>He was still breathing hard. "That you're pregnant, of course."</p>

		<p>Oh, my God.</p>

		<p>Oh, my God.</p>

		<p>I'm the only one she told.</p>

		<p>I told Frasier.</p>

		<p>And somehow.... Oh, I should know by now that my brother has the biggest mouth in Seattle.</p>

		<p>The looked she shot me froze me. She looked confused. Then betrayed. Hurt.</p>

		<p>And angry.</p>

		<p>Furious.</p>

		<p>At me.</p>

		<p>This time, I wouldn't enjoy our fight. It wasn't about something so simple as a soap opera. It would spear us to the core.</p>

		<p>She returned Donny's hug. "Let's go get some coffee, shall we? I've got some things to explain."</p>

		<p>He nodded, and they left, he with a smile, she with only a cold nod at me.</p>

		<p>I stared at Eddie, who had wound his leash around my legs in a way that ensured that, should I stand, I would fall on my face.</p>

		<p>As if I hadn't already.</p>

		<p>I wanted to cry. I couldn't breath.</p>

		<p>She'd never leave him, now.</p>

		<p align="center">*****</p>

		<p>We sat side by side on the window bench in Cafe Nervosa. We'd talked a little, and she'd explained that she'd been suspicious but that it'd turned out to be nothing.</p>

		<p>She also explained that Frasier found out before anyone because he found the box of the pregnancy test in the kitchen.</p>

		<p>It made sense.</p>

		<p>She didn't tell me how she felt about it.</p>

		<p>I've always wanted kids. An when I thought she might be pregnant, I was ecstatic. Just jumping out of my skin, really.</p>

		<p>Now, I was disappointed, but I knew we'd have other chances. I mean, God, we weren't even married yet. We had time, ya know?</p>

		<p>Daph was looking away from me, out the window, and man, she looked crushed. Devastated. Like her best friend had just walloped her one or something. Damn, I've never seen her look so bad. She was fighting back tears, I could tell.</p>

		<p>"Daph, it's okay. We've got years and years to think about this. We don't have to have kids right now. Maybe we'll try again after we're married. It's okay."</p>

		<p>She looked over me and nodded tearfully, but I got the impression that there was a hell of a lot more to this than she was letting on.</p>

		<p>I mean, I'm a divorce lawyer. I see these things, ya know?</p>

		<p>And come to think of it, what were she and Niles doing out in the park, anyway? He hates the park.</p>

		<p>I shook my head. No sense in filling my head with ridiculous notions. As if Niles was plotting to break us up or something. Niles couldn't plot himself out of a paper bag. "C'mon, Daph. We'll go get some dinner, okay?"</p>
