<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 6 -->

<p>"You're going out on a DATE?" "Riley sit down! You too
Xander." Considering Buffy had her back turned while she was facing
Riley it was even more shaming as Xander sank back down. "It's not a
date." Riley had yet to sit down. "Not to you maybe, but what about
her?" Buffy had found them much as she left them except Riley Finn
seemed about as upset as Xander while Willow, Tara and Giles seemed as
bored as Anya normally was. On her way back she had made a stop by
home where her mother had voiced her support and it made what she was
saying all the easier. "Riley, I'm with you. You have to have faith in
that. I'm not even attracted to other women."</p>

<p>From the couch they heard Willow. "Well I wasn't either
until…" The entire room looked at her and she blushed. "Never mind."
Buffy simply blinked for several seconds and then turned back to a
triumphant looking Riley Finn. Buffy was about ready to speak when
Giles interrupted. "Even if that were the case it wouldn't matter.
Whether it would be another man or another woman a relationship is
strong enough or it isn't." Buffy looked at her watcher gratefully
while Riley's expression was far less kindly. "Riley, you trust me, or
you don't." He shook his head. "It's her I don't trust." Buffy shook
her head. "It's not about her Riley! Faith isn't out to kill me, and
she can't make me do anything I don't want to." While he still didn't
look convinced he seemed unable to come up with an argument to that.</p>

<p>It was perhaps predictable that Xander didn't seem to let that
stop him as he stood up. "Yeah, but what will happen when she gets you
alone?" Buffy openly rolled her eyes. "What? She's going to seduce
me?" Xander stood back up. "Yeah but she may go all sapphic slayer on
you and steal a kiss like she did in the mansion." "She didn't steal a
kiss! That was different." "How?" She paused. "Faith was… saying
goodbye." Xander scoffed. "What, doesn't a wave cut it for her?" Buffy
looked lost in the memory as she replied. "This wasn't just a
"Goodbye, See you tomorrow." kind of thing." Xander stepped close and
his voice softened. "No Buffy, it was Faith saying goodbye to the
woman she loves. It was at that point she went "Fatal Attraction" on
you." She looked him in the eyes as he continued in a calm voice.</p>

<p>"I know Buffy, you don't feel that way towards her. I also
know how seductive she can be, and even if you turn her down who's to
say that won't set her off again?" He didn't see that his girlfriend
had rose to her feet at the last part of his sentence. "WHAT?" His
eyes got wide, and everyone there would say they could see his life
flashing in them. He turned. "Anya, I…" She screamed "YOU!" and then
slapped him and then stormed out the door as he followed right behind
her. Riley's sad expression seemed touched with amusement at the
scene. "He's right Buffy, and you know it. Faith may be entirely
sincere, but another rejection might send her right back over the
edge."</p>

<p>"So what would you have me do Riley? She tells me she loves
me, do I just spit on her?" Unbidden that memory from when she was in
the other slayer's body came to mind. It was not something she had
really shared with the others because it was still able to rattle her
every time she thought about it. He shook his head. "Just be careful."
Her expression softened. "I will." Both of their postures relaxed and
he took her in his arms. She nuzzled to his broad chest and he seemed
to savor the feel of resting his cheek to her head. "So do you girls
need a chaperone?" While his tone was playful the relaxed posture of
Buffy Summers became slumped, and then hardened. "No Riley, that will
be ok." Agent Finn couldn't help but be rattled at the coolness of her
tone. The only times he had heard her use it was when talking to
demons, or his superior officers.</p>

<p>She pulled out of his arms and took a step back. "Listen
Riley, I am not one of your soldiers that you can give orders to, and
right now I'm not even sure if I want to be your girlfriend." The
injured expression that crossed his face caused her to pause. "We'll
talk later ok?" He took a step closer. "Do you see? She already has
you about to break up with me." The slayer's nostrils flared. "She"
has nothing to do with it, you do. Riley, I am not just your
girlfriend, I am not just Buffy Summers, I'm the slayer. That's what
this is about. I am not some defenseless maiden needing you to ride up
and save me." Again an outburst from Willow interrupted the
conversation. "Cowboy Guy!"</p>

<p>Everyone stared at Willow with their confusion apparent, but
Buffy quickly recovered. "I'm not looking for a protector Riley, I'm
looking for a partner." Buffy then took the path that Xander and Anya
had taken by storming out. Riley seemed to look plaintively to Giles.
"Doesn't she understand that I'm trying to work with her?" Giles began
cleaning his glasses while looking sorry for the young man. "She's
never had such problems with the rest of us. If anything we have had
to show her that she can rely on us." Riley nodded. "I'm going to as
well." He then took the same path but more determined then angry.
Giles sighed. "I suppose we should call… or "beep" Buffy." He looked
plaintively at Willow and it caused her to grin as she got up and
walked to the phone.</p>

<p>Tara followed her as Giles watched off to the side. The shy
blonde's voice was even quieter then it usually was as she whispered
to Willow. "Do you think Buffy feels like that for Faith?" Willow
actually looked shamed when as she entered the numeric message to
Buffy. "Do you remember when I said I liked having something that was
mine?" Tara blushed as she nodded which caused Willow to smile at her.
"That's what Buffy had with Faith. They were the "chosen two"… and I
was jealous of how much time they were spending together." Tara looked
upset, but Willow smiled. "Not that way, I just felt like I was
loosing my best friend and instead of seeing it was giving something
Buffy needed and I harped on Buffy about it. I was Xander."</p>

<p>Tara smiled and put her hand on Willow's. "You c…could never
be that bad. S…still Faith did do all those bad things." Willow
nodded. "Maybe it would have been different if Buffy had felt freer to
be there for her. There's nothing I can change, but I can try to do it
right this time." Tara smiled at her again and Willow smiled back. The
two started to get lost in looking into each other's eyes, but they
became painfully aware of Giles obviously NOT watching them. The pair
smiled shyly as they turned to face him and Willow spoke. "She's got
the message, and now we wait. Got any cards?" Tara was about to reach
into her purse but quickly dropped her hand. Willow smiled at her and
Tara looked down. "Just t…tarot." The other two grinned and Giles
spoke. "How oddly appropriate." Tara seemed surprised as Giles began
clearing a spot at the table while Willow took her by the arm and
guided her there. </p>

<p>Buffy had gotten the page and was in the process of looking
for a payphone. While she had felt justified in storming out it was
not until she had that she realized she had three hours before she was
supposed to meet Faith. Sure she had said pick up Faith, but it was
just dinner, not dancing or anything. Of course the thought took Buffy
back to when she DID dance with Faith and her heartbeat kicked up a
couple notches. She clamped it back down as she shook her head to
herself. Ok the dancing with Faith was fun, but that's all it was.
Buffy believed that back then, and now she was able to believe it for
all of five seconds. Of course back then she didn't think that much
about it. That was what she loved about Faith, for once in her life
she didn't have to wrestle with inner turmoil, she could just feel.</p>

<p>Buffy stopped walking and stood stunned in the middle of the
sidewalk. Love? What she loved about Faith? When she began walking
again it seemed to help her think. Was it her fault? Sure she had fun
with Faith, but did she lead the feisty brunette on? Buffy was aware
that Faith had not had much love in her life, and it sickened her with
guilt to think that Buffy's friendship could have led Faith to think
there could be more. The problem with that was that Faith never seemed
to expect that from Buffy. If Buffy HAD been leading her on Faith
wouldn't have hid her feelings so long. It was more that she loved
Buffy, but had accepted that Buffy could never love her "that way". Of
course Willow's slip seemed to bring that into question.</p>

<p>It hadn't been entirely easy when Willow… came out to her, but
Willow was her friend, and if Willow was in love then Buffy was happy
for her. Was that it? Did Willow's coming out hit too close to home?
Did it have anything to do with Willow at all? Buffy had to resist the
urge to scream. Still, Willow's decision didn't have anything to do
with her. So Buffy figured it wouldn't have anything to do with
Willow, but could she be considering it? Did she have feelings for
Faith? She had just argued with Riley that she didn't, but then there
was Riley. After you got over the whole "worked for a government
agency that thought they could deal with the Devil and not get
burned".</p>

<p>Still Riley came through in the end, but so did Faith, even
when in a coma. Faith came through in a dream no less, and Buffy knew
it was her. She didn't know how, but she knew it really was Faith. Not
like the dreams she had of Angel where she dreamt OF him. With Faith
she dreamt WITH her. It hurt to think it, but she had never dreamed of
Riley, at least not in that way. The only dream she could remember of
Riley was the one the first slayer gave her when Riley and a human
looking Adam plotted world domination… from their pillow fort. Of
course when she dreamt of Angel it was right before he lost his soul,
was that was it cost people to love her? Angel said he was in the
business of saving souls, had Faith lost hers for the same reason
Angel did? </p>

<p>It was with a sickening lurch she realized where her feet had
lead her. The mansion stood before her the shadow from the house
covering her both body and soul. A place filled with memories and none
of them good. The place where she sent Angel to hell and where she
chained him while his mind returned after he got back. It was also the
place Faith chained her, or at least thought she did as she prepared
to have Angel torture her. Yet it was also the place that she kissed
Buffy goodbye. The same impulse that led her there led her inside. As
she walked through halls, dark even in the dwindling light of day she
saw a light, but it was not from the fireplace, that had fallen into
cold, dead embers. The light was cast by Faith, and like a moth to
that flame it pulled her forward. The other slayer was training, but
with Angel's Spartan decorating that was probably all there was to do.</p>

<p>Faith was wearing a sports bra and sweat shorts to make it
easier to move. Strong, smooth motions of the other slayer were almost
hypnotic. The speed and grace that Buffy remembered were still there,
but Faith had also found focus. Before Buffy used to watch it to help
Faith find her weaknesses, now Buffy just liked watching it. She liked
seeing the rippling of muscle along Faith's frame, and the light sheen
of perspiration that had broken out seemed to give Faith a glow. The
entire effect was rather soothing to her, calming. Faith seemed at
peace, and Buffy felt at peace as well, and when she jumped as she
turned to face Buffy, Buffy jumped as well. "Buffy!" "Faith!"</p>
