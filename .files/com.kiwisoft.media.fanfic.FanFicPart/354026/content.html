<!-- Starlight \ Part 11 -->

<p>Xander ducked under a burly tentacle-like appendage that was aimed directly for his head, and skittered off over to the side just barely avoiding becoming the headless Xand-man. Trying to regain his balance he just barely avoided knocking over Willow who was barely holding onto her already precarious state of balance behind him.</p>

<p>&#34;Giles man, have you got with the stabbing yet?!&#34; Xander yelled hurling himself and Willow out of the range of another bone-breaking punch that was all for them.</p>

<p>&#34;Patience is a virtue,&#34; Giles yelled back moments before getting knocked against the cave wall. &#34;I'll work faster,&#34; he muttered to himself pushing off the wall and twisting out of the way of another intended blow.</p>

<p>&#34;You okay Will?&#34; Xander asked getting off of her. His 'avoiding death' push, turned out to actually be an 'oh God don't let me die' shove that ended with him on top of Willow.</p>

<p>&#34;I will be once you g-e-t o-f-f!&#34; Willow said grunting slightly as she attempted to aid Xander in the removal process.</p>

<p>&#34;Righ…tttttttt!&#34; Xander started to respond before getting some more help from the Scheaklar which latched onto the back of his pants and pulled him up into the air.</p>

<p>&#34;One thing you have to admit,&#34; Spike yelled joining in after seeing Xander get flung around. &#34;It's got multi-tasking down to an art form,&#34; he went on ducking under a tentacle and coming up in front of the beast to start pummeling its head.</p>

<p>&#34;Pain, my new best friend,&#34; Xander groaned picking himself up off of the ground and stumbling back into the fray.</p>

<p>Giles who had managed to pull his sword from it's sheath charged the demon arching the blade above his head, before lowering the blade swiftly, cutting off the one of the demons limbs.</p>

<p>&#34;Why, I repeat, WHY are we not using our flash lights?!&#34; Giles yelled peevishly jumping out of the way of yet another counter attack.</p>

<p>&#34;Oh, I don't know…maybe because we're playing bumper cars WITHOUT THE BUMPERS!&#34; Xander responded. &#34;Again with the ouchy,&#34; he mumbled before getting knocked to the side again.</p>

<p>Ducking out of the way of a free flying feeler Willow spotted one of the abandoned flash lights and made a dive for it.</p>

<p>&#34;I would like to take a moment to reiterate my former statement,&#34; she said trying to turn the thing on, &#34;that we SHOULD have gone with Velcro wrist enforcements!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Perhaps,&#34; Giles responded. &#34;And this is only a suggestion…we could discuss this LATER!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Ohhhh,&#34; Spike said giddily catching the flashlight Willow tossed to him. &#34;Somebody's in a mood.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Has everybody got one?&#34; Willow yelled ignoring Spike's statement. She had managed to locate the missing flashlights.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah, yeah,&#34; Xander answered in an agitated voice. &#34;Let's turn 'em on, let's turn 'em on!&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Concentrate the burst,&#34; Giles called out to them as he attempted to move around to the back of the beast. &#34;All three of you aim for one section and keep the blast there,&#34; he continued finally able to get himself behind.</p>

<p>Willow was the first to lock onto a spot. Seeing a red circle-which equaled target-on it's stomach Willow locked her beam there and watched as it started to sizzle. Xander was the next to lock on, then Spike--who finally managed to tear himself away from raining a shower of fists on the beast-aimed his flashlight with the others.</p>

<p>The cave was starting to fill with smoke, and the Scheaklar was in a considerable amount of pain. The damaged caused by the initial beam had more that quadrupled in size, and there was now a hole approximately the breadth of a head.</p>

<p>The Scheaklar was howling in pain now, trying to huddle into a protective ball. The talons it had been assaulting them with since the entered the cave were now being recalled into its body, and it was lowering onto it's hunches.</p>

<p>Giles waited until he was sure the demon was suitably distracted then he stealthily moved in on it. Drawing his sword he raised it above his head, and then without a moments hesitation he struck savagely, thrusting the blade in between the Scheaklars shoulder blades.</p>

<p>The demon reared up, expanding to its full height and width, it's tentacles extending out in all directions, once the blade was thrust into it. Giles, and the rest of the gang backed up against the walls when the beast started to revolt, endeavoring to wait out the outburst without getting injured.</p>

<p>&#34;I think it's dead,&#34; Xander commented once the beast had quieted down. It had been over a minute since it last moved.</p>

<p>Giles bent down and removed the knife he had strapped to his ankle.</p>

<p>&#34;How very James Bond of you,&#34; Spike commented as he walked over to the demon and started to kick it experimentally.</p>

<p>Giles ignored him and walked over to the body.</p>

<p>&#34;I'm going to need a little light,&#34; Giles said as he bent down over the body.</p>
