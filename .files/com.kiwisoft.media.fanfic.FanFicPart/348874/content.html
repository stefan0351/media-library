<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 19 - New and Lost Treasures-->

<P>A cold breeze entered the cavern and gave both B'Elanna and Seven goose
bumps.</P>
<P>"Wooo, it's starting to get chilly. Maybe we should clean your wound one last
time before we freeze to death." </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed Seven's arms up and down, careful to avoid the silky
makeshift Band-Aid. </P>
<P>"A prudent suggestion," Seven answered, half-shaking from the cold.</P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly removed her panties wrapped around Seven's shoulder, making
sure the bleeding had slowed down before removing it completely. </P>
<P>"Let me just clean this here, and then we can wipe away the blood."</P>
<P>B'Elanna brought her underwear to the waterfall and began rinsing and
wringing it. Seven sat still watching the water spray up in a soft mist,
covering B'Elanna's shaking form.</P>
<P>"What?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna noticed Seven's unwavering eyes.</P>
<P>"I … was…" Seven babbled, caught off guard at the question.</P>
<P>"Was what? Watching me freeze here while you sit in the warm area away from
the cold water." </P>
<P>"Precisely." </P>
<P>Seven smiled as much as she could given her Borg nature.</P>
<P>"We'll see about that." </P>
<P>B'Elanna cupped the water-soaked panties in her hands, making sure not to
wring it, and carried it over to a now nervous Seven. B'Elanna's eyes gleamed
with mischief as she stepped closer to the sitting Borg.</P>
<P>"I believe you have malevolent intentions."</P>
<P>"What makes you say that?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped abruptly, holding her weapon just in front of Seven's
face.</P>
<P>"You did not adequately remove the water from your undergarment," Seven
swallowed.</P>
<P>"Oh did I forget to do that?" B'Elanna asked innocently. "Let me fix that
right now." </P>
<P>B'Elanna brought the soaked panties to the side of Seven's face, just above
the wounded left shoulder and began to squeeze the water out, splashing the
Blonde Borg in the face as well.</P>
<P>Seven turned her head and closed her eyes, avoiding the cold water.</P>
<P>"I do not believe you are attempting to clean the wound."</P>
<P>"What do you mean? The water's washing away the blood isn't it?"</P>
<P>"Yes, but the majority of it is ending up on my face, a highly inefficient
use of resources." </P>
<P>Seven gave the smiling Lieutenant an amusingly annoyed look.</P>
<P>"We've got an unlimited supply of water, I'd hardly call it inefficient."</P>
<P>"Your assumption is flawed. The water that flows into this cavern cannot
possibly be unlimited," Seven retorted, grabbing B'Elanna's panties with her
right hand.</P>
<P>"Hey, those are my unmentionables if you don't mind." </P>
<P>B'Elanna reached for her panties, but Seven had them tightly closed inside
her fist.</P>
<P>"I do not see why you require such unnecessary clothing," Seven stated, while
B'Elanna continued her futile efforts at opening the Borg's amazingly strong
human hand.</P>
<P>"I'd hardly call it unnecessary Seven," B'Elanna breathed out in frustration,
finally giving up on the her panties.</P>
<P>"Your attempts at retrieving your underwear are futile."</P>
<P>B'Elanna put her hands on her hips and tilted her neck, still somewhat in awe
at the topless Borg in front of her, but not enough to phase her new found
energy. </P>
<P>"So what are you going to do? Keep them for your private collection?" </P>
<P>Seven's heart stopped at the accusation, unsure if the Lieutenant was teasing
her or was actually serious. Noting the playful smile and body language, Seven's
worries were quickly dismissed.</P>
<P>"Yes, as a matter of fact, I was planning on exhibiting them in my private
museum."</P>
<P>"Oh, and what exhibit would they be next to?"</P>
<P>"I have not decided yet, however, I will place them in the new redundant
clothing collection." </P>
<P>"Redundant huh. If it wasn't for my unmentionables you wouldn't have such a
nice arm bandage, now would you?" B'Elanna teased.</P>
<P>"True, but I still do not see the purpose of wearing these on board Voyager."
</P>
<P>Seven opened up her fist, dangling the freshly ruffled panties an arms length
away from the Lieutenant.</P>
<P>"Purpose, what purpose do you need other than making you feel not naked."
</P>
<P>B'Elanna reached for the prize, but it was quickly pulled back beyond the
half-Klingon's reach. The stubborn woman that she was, B'Elanna continued
reaching; losing her balance. Seven's arms instinctively came up and caught the
flustered, yet fiery Lieutenant, still attempting to retrieve her panties. Chest
to chest, face to face, breath to breath, the two searched each other's soulful
eyes, B'Elanna looking deep into an innocent sea of tropical blue, Seven looking
deep into a pained history of chestnut brown. Understanding, desire, and need,
discovered for the first time by someone who never knew love, and found a second
time by someone who'd lost love.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's hands slowly worked their way up behind Seven's naked back and
pulled her in closer. Dropping the now forgotten undergarment, Seven's human
hand reached behind B'Elanna's head and drew in the waiting Lieutenant. No more
hesitation, no more embarrassment, and no more lies, the two captured each
other's hungry mouths. B'Elanna's tongue urgently explored the hidden treasure
of Seven's untouched mouth, while Seven reciprocated with anxious hands,
caressing the Lieutenant through her wet gray tank top.</P>
<P>Moaning, cooing and the suction sounds of passion filled the air. B'Elanna's
naturally aggressive nature took over, and she began kissing and licking the
newly found Borg's neck, down to her right shoulder. </P>
<P>Arching her neck back, Seven exposed what B'Elanna had desired for so long,
and thought she could never have. B'Elanna's hands molded the mountainous mounds
of flesh, teasing the pink peaks with soft, light touches, forcing Seven to
close her eyes.</P>
<P>A kiss on the chin, brought Seven's eyes back open, and she saw a pleading,
questioning B'Elanna asking for one thing. Along with a slight nod, Seven's
tear-stained eyes gave the answer. B'Elanna brought her lips to Seven's, saying
thank you, and then began their descent to the glowing globes that could drop
men and cause failures in Engineering.</P>
<P>Gently licking both of Seven's nipples, brought them up from hiding. B'Elanna
feasted, her watery mouth leaving trails across Seven's breasts. After
unconsciously bringing her hand up to Seven's wounded shoulder and causing a
slight whimper of pain, B'Elanna stopped, worried she had seriously hurt the
woman she now knew she loved.</P>
<P>A soft hand on the shoulder, reassured B'Elanna that Seven was okay.
Realizing Seven's attempts at standing up, B'Elanna helpfully wrapped her arms
around the stumbling Borg and lifted her up. </P>
<P>"What is it?" B'Elanna asked curiously.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes focused on the waterfall, the one that she had secretly watched
B'Elanna bathe under. </P>
<P>"You want to go there do you?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled, watching the young woman happily nod her head in agreement.
One arm wrapped behind Seven's back, B'Elanna helped the beautiful blonde to the
waiting falls.</P>
<P>The cold mist peppered their skin, making both woman shiver in anticipation
of the freezing water. B'Elanna took Seven's human hand and brought it to the
falling water, causing both to open their mouths and gasp at the cold.</P>
<P>Not wanting to let either of them change their mind, Seven swiftly grabbed
the Lieutenant and brought her into the ice-cold water. B'Elanna's shocked
response was quickly muffled by Seven's mouth, exploring urgently, like B'Elanna
had done before. Shaking ferociously, the two lovers clasped onto each other for
warmth. A feeling of icy-cold fear brought them together, for the sake of
survival and for the sake of love. </P>
<P>Seven's desire grew into a flood, tearing at the top of B'Elanna's tank top,
but the Lieutenant's hands stopped her, guiding Seven's hands to the bottom of
her shirt and letting her pull it over her head, allowing the gushing water to
wash all over B'Elanna's body. </P>
<P>Not to be outdone, B'Elanna reached down and pulled the tightest cat-suit
know to man off of the freezing Borg, exposing the honey-laden treasure. Falling
to her knees, B'Elanna brought her mouth to Seven's swollen lips, licking the
lips up and down, finally reaching the love button. Knowing that it was Seven's
first time, B'Elanna wanted to make it special, and last as long as possible.
Taking two fingers, B'Elanna spread Seven's labia apart, and licked each side
before working on the pink slit. Seven's gyrations, encouraged B'Elanna to work
a little faster, slathering her tongue inside of Seven, tasting the tangy juices
of her Borg Queen. </P>
<P>Not wanting to waste a drop of Seven's nectar, B'Elanna greedily licked up as
much as possible, before attempting to bring the young woman to a final climax.
Sensing Seven couldn't last much longer, B'Elanna entered a water-slick finger
inside the moaning woman, and began licking and sucking on Seven's clitoris,
determined to make Seven's first time, the most memorable. Sliding her finger
inside the honeyed walls of Seven's slit, B'Elanna penetrated her with one final
deep thrust, forcing Seven to cry out, collapsing on top of B'Elanna.</P>
<P>Gently taking her finger out of the still climaxing Borg, B'Elanna
seductively licked it from base to tip, finally wrapping her mouth around it,
drinking the remaining love juice. Holding the shaking form in her arms,
B'Elanna softly kissed her lover, comforting her, letting her feel her
presence.</P>
<P>Still shaking, from both the cold water splashing down upon them, and from
the most exhilarating experience of her life, Seven reached for B'Elanna's
pants, wanting to give her the same pleasure that she had so delightfully
received. </P>
<P>B'Elanna happily obliged, allowing Seven to slip the water-soaked Starfleet
pants from her legs. Seven admired B'Elanna's smooth body, caressing, kissing
and licking almost every inch. She wanted so much for B'Elanna to feel the way
she felt, so she started the same way, molding, kissing, and teasing the tan
breasts before she decided to taste B'Elanna's inner sanctum. </P>
<P>Sated by B'Elanna's breasts, Seven kissed the Lieutenant's chin, and asked a
slightly different question than B'Elanna had asked her before, with pleading
eyes. </P>
<P>Upon receiving the answer, Seven passionately kissed her lover, and began her
journey down to the nectar-rich sanctum. Remembering every detail, Seven
performed perfectly the exact same pleasures B'Elanna had bestowed upon her.
Bringing her mouth to B'Elanna's swollen lips and sliding her tongue up and
down, reaching the clitoris with one long lick, Seven tasted the flowing juices
of an impassioned B'Elanna. Spreading her slit apart, Seven licked each side
before tasting the inner depths of heaven. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's cries echoed throughout the cavern walls, while Seven relentlessly
slid her tongue along B'Elanna's slit, lustily licking up every drop of honey
that came gushing out. Realizing that B'Elanna was not long from climax, Seven
easily slipped her finger inside the slick walls of B'Elanna's sanctum, sliding
in and out, sucking on her clit, and one final penetration, brought B'Elanna to
a screaming orgasm.</P>
<P>Riding the waves of climax, B'Elanna captured Seven's mouth, thanking her
lovingly. Gently sliding her finger out from B'Elanna's slit, Seven brought it
to her mouth and licked it up and down seductively, forcing a smile from the
hungry Lieutenant.</P>
