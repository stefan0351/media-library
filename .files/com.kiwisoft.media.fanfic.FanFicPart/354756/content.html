<!-- Reunions \ Amphipolis -->

<p>It wasn't long before the last house in Potidaea was passed, and as
they exited the town, the riders became quiet and introspective. Xena could see that the
tears were continuing to flow and quickly dry on her bard's face as they galloped away
from the seaside village and on toward Amphipolis.</p>

<p>After a candlemark of silence, the warrior breached the barrier.
&quot;That was really sweet of Lila to name her daughter after you Gabrielle. You never
know how truly loved you are by family members until they do something like that in your
memory.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was quite a surprise, but a little unnerving with her looking
so much like me. If it happened in real time for us, at least I would have had the
opportunity to watch her grow, and we would never have looked almost identical at the same
time, as I would have aged also. Nothing like having a niece who looks like she could be
my younger sister and a sister who looks like she could be my mother.&quot; The blonde
looked over and smiled at her lover. &quot;That was some surprise, but you're right, Xena,
it was a pleasant one. I'm very glad we made the trip; even if Lila can't make it to the
joining, stopping to see her and to meet all the new members of the family was a marvelous
experience. Who knows what we'll find in Amphipolis.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably nothing much different than when we left it.&quot; Xena
remarked.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't count on it; I didn't expect Potidaea to have grown so
and look what happened to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Eve was riding on the other side of Xena and pulled over a little
closer. &quot;Mother, did you say Uncle Toris lived in Amphipolis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, he did when last I heard, Eve. After 25 years, I wouldn't
even venture a guess. I do hope, for Mother's sake, that he stuck around and settled down.
By the way, you girls seemed to make quite an impression on Gabby. So, does she want to be
an Amazon now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very funny, Mother . . . does Jason want to be a warrior?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Touché, smarty,&quot; Xena acknowledged. &quot;It's just that
every time I heard her talking, she was asking questions about you being Amazons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I didn't have that many answers,&quot; Eve confessed.
&quot;Most of the Amazon questions were answered by Toxaris.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Toxaris interjected, &quot;but she is so proud to be a
relative of an Amazon Princess . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And an Amazon Queen,&quot; Eve finished, looking over at
Gabrielle. &quot;Gabby never thought she was going to get to met her famous Aunt
Gabrielle, Bard of Potidaea and Queen of the Amazons. Talk about your hero worship.&quot;
Eve giggled and the blonde gave her a slightly sarcastic look, but the smile was a dead
give away that it also boosted her ego tremendously to have her niece think that highly of
her.</p>

<p>&quot;All in all, I think it was a fantastic visit, Mom. Aunt Lila is
very nice and so are Aeson and Jason, even though we couldn't seem to keep them in the
house longer than the time it took for them to eat.&quot; She laughed and turned to say
something to Toxaris.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry Lila won't be able to come to the wedding,
Gabrielle.&quot; Xena consoled.</p>

<p>&quot;It's really okay; she has a lot to do to get ready for Jason's
nuptials and I'm sure it would be a taxing journey for her. She's about as comfortable
being on a horse as I used to be.&quot; The blonde smiled over at her mate. &quot;Besides,
she might feel a little out of place with all the Amazons around. She's really a small
town girl at heart. It all turned out for the best, I'm sure, especially since we promised
to go visit again when this season rolls back around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That we will my love and that will give us a reason to stop in
Amphipolis on the way home again. I think we will be making the trip yearly for a two-fold
reason. Dite did say that Mother was frail, and that could mean many things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, don't you start worrying yourself about that until after we
get to Amphipolis and see Cyrene. Knowing your mother, she's probably a feisty old
crone.&quot; The small blonde glanced playfully at the love of her life. &quot;And we have
what, two days you think to get there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we make good time, yes. Whenever you get tired we'll stop to
rest; I know you didn't get much sleep last night, and to tell you the truth, I don't
think the girls did either. I recall hearing them and Gabby talking long after you started
snoring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena! I don't snore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, right!&quot; The warrior commented as she picked up speed,
daring the other horses to keep up.</p>

<p>They rode hard and long and the sun was far beyond the midday position
when they stopped by a creek side to water and rest the horses and have something to eat.</p>

<p>Lila had loaded them down with all sorts of goodies, fruits, breads,
cookies, nutbread, cheese, hard boiled eggs, dried pork jerky, and salted beef. She
insisted on giving them each a sack filled with food, even when Gabrielle protested that
it would leave her storehouse leaner than it should be. Lila stubbornly disputed her
sister's objections, stating &quot;Consider these the gifts you would have taken with you
every time you came to visit in the 25 years you were frozen and they won't seem like so
much. You're merely getting them all in one visit. Now stop arguing with your 'elder' and
pack the saddlebags.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled to herself as she remembered the sweetly sarcastic
conversation and then the smile of satisfaction on her sister's face when each of the
women had a bag packed safely on a horse. It was wonderful seeing Lila again, but her
heart ached to see her younger sister so much older. She shook her head to rid her mind of
the thoughts and dismounted to give Ginger some water.</p>

<p>Xena was absolutely right in the fact that none of them had gotten an
adequate night's sleep. She even suggested that they all lie down and rest for a while
after eating so no one would be tempted to sleep on horseback. </p>

<p>&quot;Besides, the longer rest we give the horses now, the longer and
harder we can ride them afterward. I figure even with some rest, we should have only three
candlemarks left to travel before the sky gets too dark to see clearly and even then, with
the land here being fairly level, we can travel as long as we have good moonlight and
starlight to see by.&quot;</p>

<p>Arguments were nonexistent and after eating and cleaning up, they laid
out the bedrolls beneath the shade of the trees near the creek. Within minutes the only
sounds were those of nature and those of snoring Amazons and a warrior. Xena was the first
to awaken after a short interval. She never needed more than half a candlemark to refresh.
Upon lying down to rest, she would will herself to sleep quickly and deeply, creating the
illusion of a full night's sleep from less than a candlemark's. It was a trick she
attempted to teach Gabrielle, but so far her success in training the bard was nonexistent.
The air felt cooler and it would be a good time to travel; the horses wouldn't overheat as
easily. After packing everything except the bedrolls, Xena woke everyone up and shortly
thereafter they were on the go again.</p>

<p>Gabrielle began having them all play the game she and Xena used to play
when traveling from town to town, &quot;Who Am I.&quot; It was one of the few games the
warrior seemed to enjoy playing as she was very good at guessing and even better at giving
hints that threw the other players off the track when she was the person who was 'it.'</p>

<p>Shortly after nightfall they began looking for an area suitable for
stopping. Xena didn't feel that any of the spots the women suggested were appropriate and
safe enough for them to sleep through the night without posting a lookout, and the only
one she would have relied on to not fall asleep was herself. The warrior no longer trusted
the more traveled roads between the cities, especially after 25 years of not having
traveled them herself. Gabrielle was beginning to get a little short tempered about
stopping when Xena recognized markings on the well-trodden road they were on.</p>

<p>&quot;We're in luck, ladies,&quot; the warrior announced. &quot;I do
believe we are less than a candlemark away from Acanthus and there should be an Inn, warm
baths, food, and wine without any of us having to do any fetching, cooking, or
cleaning.&quot;</p>

<p>That news, of course, went over well with everyone concerned and the
horses were given a little nudge and promised extra carrots or apples if they would not
object and go the distance at a quickened pace.</p>

<p>True to her word within the hour they saw the outline of a town and at
the center of the buildings there was, indeed, a tavern with sleeping quarters upstairs.
After paying for their food and lodging, the women asked if there was a private bathing
room. Again they were in luck and Xena and Toxaris flipped a dinar to see which couple got
to use the facilities first. Xena won the toss and she and Gabrielle grabbed their
belongings and headed for the bath while Toxaris and Eve decided to stay in the main room
and mingle with the town folk.</p>

<p>They were told that the bath area was actually behind the main
establishment, in a small adjacent building, and after retrieving the key from the
Innkeeper, they followed his directions, which took them down the long hall and out the
back entrance. Once Xena opened the door to the bathing chamber, it was easy to understand
why the building was locked. She locked the door behind them and the two women surveyed
the oversized room. </p>

<p>It was unusually extravagant for an inn of this size; the walls were
lined with an aromatic cedar, indigenous to the surrounding area, and the tub seemed to be
made out of the same wood and bound with large rings of brass. The warmth of the room was
the first thing they noticed upon entering. Their guess was that the tub water was kept at
an almost constant warm temperature, while the steam off of it heated the entire room. The
large tub was cradled on a bed of hot stones and seated firmly into a brass holder. The
two women looked at each other and smiled; this was going to be fun.</p>

<p>&quot;Just look at the size of that tub; you need steps to get in, at
least I need to use the steps.&quot; Gabrielle giggled as she pointed to the three steps
leading up to the large reservoir of water. </p>

<p>Xena spied a pipe coming in through the wall and attached to the top of
the hot tub. It had a spigot for fresh water and a second pipe that lead out of the tub at
the bottom and also disappeared through the wall for drainage. Towels hung from hooks on
the wall, and shelves containing scented soap, candles, and oils were well stocked. There
were lanterns strategically placed on the perimeter of the walls and a few of them were
lit. Xena walked over and extinguished all but one of the lamps, which she carried over
closer to the tub. She proceeded to collect a few candles from a shelf and lit them using
the lantern. After carefully placing the candles around the outer rim of the tub, she
turned the lamp almost all the way down and put it back in its wall position.</p>

<p>Gabrielle brought over some oils and added them to the bath as well as
a bottle marked 'foaming liquid soap'. &quot;Great . . . bubbles . . . I love
bubbles,&quot; she chuckled to herself, while pouring the sweet smelling concoction into
the water, and turning on the spout, enticing the bubbles to form. Placing a bar of
peppermint soap on a holder on the top of the tub, she went back to the shelves to get a
sponge.</p>

<p>Xena was the first to undress and enter the now frothing liquid, but it
wasn't long before a very naked and alluring bard joined her.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhh,&quot; the blonde exclaimed as she lowered herself into the
water and found that there were formed seats carved into the tub. &quot;Isn't this
marvelous?&quot; She looked over at her warrior who was scooted down with only her head
above the water line.</p>

<p>&quot;Fantastic,&quot; came the throaty reply.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad we won the toss; I'll bet it takes quite a while for
this to fill and heat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably not that long,&quot; the warrior countered, having
remembered that there were hot springs on the outskirts of the town. People had certainly
been inventive in the 25 years she and Gabrielle had been frozen. She reached over and
pulled the blonde close. &quot;Come here you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-E-S?&quot; The blonde drawled out the word seductively.</p>

<p>Since actions speak louder than words, the warrior decided to use the
former and kissed her lover gently on the lips, receiving an instant replay in reverse.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, this is the way to relax after a long ride.&quot; Xena
gently coaxed the smaller woman over onto her lap. &quot;When we get settled, I want to
build something like this behind the hut. A totally secluded retreat where no one will
intrude.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a great idea, then we won't have so far to travel in the
cold seasons and we'll be able to bathe more often.&quot; She threw her arms around the
muscular shoulders in front of her and nuzzled her face into the long, slender neck. She
could feel her lover's nipples reacting to the touch of her breasts as she leaned into
her. &quot;I love you Xena. This has been a great trip so far. I can't wait until we get
to Amphipolis tomorrow evening.&quot; She shivered slightly.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you can't be cold, Gabrielle. Why did you just
shiver?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it's just the anticipation of seeing Cyrene again and the
added expectation that you might have new family to meet just as I did. Oh, Xena, wouldn't
it be wonderful if Toris did stay around and you had nieces and nephews?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it most definitely would . . . but you know what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, what?&quot; Emerald eyes sparkled in the flickering
candlelight as she looked into the eyes of her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't really want to talk about anything right now. All I want
to do this very minute is hold you close and feel your heart pounding against my
chest.&quot; She nibbled delicately on a small ear then whispered, &quot;I want to make
love to you in this oversized bathtub, Gabrielle, until you are totally satisfied and the
only desire you have left in your body is to curl up into a ball, snuggle close to me and
go to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>As expected the statement received a deep sigh. Xena could feel the
smile forming on her lover's cheek as it was held tightly against her own.</p>

<p>The warrior had explored all the seats in the tub while Gabrielle was
undressing and came across a most unusually formed appendage. It was long and protruded
from the edge of the tub toward the center, allowing for a participant to recline on it.
There was an air filled bladder attached to the outer perimeter where the patron's head
could rest. As the bed-like adjunct extended out into the middle of the tub, it allowed
room for someone to stand beside it and perhaps administer a therapeutic massage to the
person reclining. Xena, of course, had an entirely different purpose in mind for this
newly found plaything and she began maneuvering the body of the smaller woman around to
lean back on the wooden couch.</p>

<p>Never before in water had they actually been able to lie down as if
they were in a bed. Being a totally new experience, it was more than a little
intoxicating. The small blonde smiled up at her champion as she stretched out on the
appendage and then pulled her lover down on top of her. </p>

<p>&quot;I feel like a water nymph.&quot; Gabrielle purred into her
lover's ear as Xena began to slide her hands down the svelte body beneath her.</p>

<p>&quot;Seems like some maneuvers are going to be a bit precarious, but
others ought to be quite interesting.&quot; The warrior arched her eyebrow and grinned at
the beauty in front of her.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you say, <i>hold your breath</i>?&quot; Gabrielle giggled.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but I am an expert at that, my love.&quot; The warrior
assured her bard, placing her face below the water and sucking on an inviting breast,
while playfully exploring the area below the golden curls for entrance into the cave of
pleasure. </p>

<p>When the blonde was sure that the warrior could not possibly hold her
breath any longer, she reached down and pulled her lover's face up parallel to her own and
kissed her passionately. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you more than life, Xena.&quot; The bard whispered when
she finally released her champion's roaming tongue and full lips.</p>

<p>The ability to move with fluidity only heightened the warrior's desire
as she now sat straddling her bard. Placing a hand on either side of the smaller woman's
waist, she scooted her up into a sitting position, fully exposing her voluptuous breasts. </p>

<p>&quot;Eye candy as well as bodily aphrodisiacs,&quot; the warrior
mumbled as she leaned closer, covering one erect nipple with her mouth. </p>

<p>&quot;Mmm . . . you taste delicious.&quot; Xena continued, as she
rubbed her center on the soft golden curls below Gabrielle's abdomen. </p>

<p>Floating quickly to one side and allowing her fingers entrance to the
realms below the curls, the warrior pressed now against the bard's thigh, as she entered
her lover's depths. With the ebb and flow of water, she penetrated the throbbing center.</p>

<p>&quot;Gods Xena!&quot; Gabrielle panted. &quot;Harder . . . faster . .
. please . . .&quot;</p>

<p>Watery gyrations caused bubbles to re-form, surrounding the lovers in a
peppermint scented ambience, heightening their emotions, as the cool smell opened their
imaginations to partake in a liquid fantasy.</p>

<p>The answer to her bard's request was the addition of another long,
slender, finger into the center of Gabrielle's core, while the warrior's thumb frantically
stroked the hardened nub above the pulsing cave of yearning. &quot;Come for me, Gabrielle.
Come for me, my love &#150; let me feel the zenith of your desire.&quot; </p>

<p>With one hand resting on the small of Gabrielle's back, Xena pulled
them closer together until their bodies lay as one on the wooden bed. She could feel her
own passion rising when she pressed hard against her lover's leg, her fingers deep within
the recesses of the bard's body. There was a simultaneous scream of release, as two
travelers found ecstasy in the warm scented water and passion's fulfillment, in the
comfort of each other's arms, in a town so very far from home. </p>

<p>For minutes afterwards, they lay in intoxicated silence, breathing
deeply and rhythmically, Xena's head resting on Gabrielle's shoulder, their bodies, from
lack of movement, beginning to float on the warm liquid.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose we should get out and dressed?&quot; Xena questioned
after a few more minutes had passed.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Gabrielle agreed, reluctantly. &quot;If anyone is
looking for us, we'll have to explain what took us so long.&quot; The bard smiled at her
lover.</p>

<p>Still, neither of them made any attempt to move; instead they both felt
quite content to float beside one another in the warmth.</p>

<p>&quot;This is great, having water that never gets cold.&quot; The bard
finally spoke again.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe.&quot; Xena grinned, lifting up her own pruning fingers and
one of Gabrielle's hands. &quot;You want to go around looking all wrinkled?&quot;</p>

<p>The blonde laughed, &quot;I imagine we'll be wrinkling soon enough,
thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then come on, let's get outta here.&quot; She pulled the plug
from the lower end of the tub and they could hear a gurgling sound as the water began to
flow through the pipe and out to who knew where. &quot;I've got a pretty good idea how to
make one of these now,&quot; the warrior informed her mate.</p>

<p>&quot;Fantastic. But we have to get you home first to do it.&quot; </p>

<p>Reluctantly they exited the tub, dressed, and opened the door back onto
the real world, their romantic rendezvous over for the time being with no hopes of another
encounter for at least the next few days.</p>

<p>&quot;We could just disappear into our room for the evening, after I
give this key back to Patroclus,&quot; Xena commented, while she locked up the building.
&quot;I'm sure the girls haven't waited for us to eat.&quot; She paused and looked at her
lover. &quot;On the other hand, I'm positive you're famished, and I don't feel like being
awakened in the middle of the night by your stomach making sounds that would keep a
Cyclops from sleeping. Having to go in search of midnight vittles is not
pleasurable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're right.&quot; Gabrielle shook her head in agreement.
&quot;We should probably go eat before retiring for the evening.&quot;</p>

<p>When they walked into the main room, they found that it was filled to
capacity with patrons. There were even people standing around without any hopes of finding
seats.</p>

<p>&quot;By the Gods.&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed. &quot;I didn't realize
this was such a popular tavern. I hope we can get something to eat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me, too.&quot; Xena countered. &quot;Let's find the girls, at
least we might have a seat.&quot;</p>

<p>They spotted the two young women seated at a small table for two over
in a corner. After greeting her mothers, Eve told them they had already eaten. Taking the
bath key from Xena, the two quickly excused themselves and headed out of the main area
toward their room. Xena gave her daughter a weird look for slithering away so quickly, but
figured they were in a hurry to get cleaned up and refreshed. The owner of the tavern came
over and handed Xena back the monies she paid for their evening's stay. </p>

<p>&quot;The other two have already eaten and there is food and wine for
the two of you whenever you are ready, my name is Patroclus,&quot; the Innkeeper informed
the puzzled warrior and bard.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they told me they ate, but . . . I don't understand . . .
&quot; Xena began.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want your money, Xena. We are honored to have you and
your bard staying with us,&quot; the owner of the inn announced. &quot;The two Amazons
that are traveling with you told us who you were. At first no one believed them. We heard
rumors of your visiting places all the time and most of those are truly that, rumors. But
those two young women were very convincing.&quot; The innkeeper glanced from one to the
other of the two women.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you Xena Warrior Princess and Gabrielle the Bard of
Potidaea?&quot; He asked.</p>

<p>Delighted to see that the expression on the man's face was one of
friendship and not hate, the warrior acknowledged the fact that, yes, they were Xena and
Gabrielle. The answer to the admission totally took the duo by surprise. </p>

<p>&quot;If Gabrielle would be so good as to grace us with a story or two
tonight, I would be happy to give all four of you meals and rooms gratis.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena looked over at her mate who was beaming with pride at being asked
to perform. She knew Gabrielle was tired, especially after making love in the bath, but
the thought of people wanting to hear her stories always perked the small blonde up. The
warrior figured dinner, a story or two and then bed wouldn't slow them down too much.
After all, they weren't in any real hurry; it wasn't like someone was expecting them in
Amphipolis.</p>

<p>&quot;You want to perform, Gabrielle?&quot; Xena asked, already knowing
the answer to the question.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, I don't mind,&quot; the blonde answered gleefully.
&quot;Free food and lodging seems like a pretty fair exchange, don't you think,
Xena?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds more than fair to me,&quot; the warrior chuckled.
&quot;You, my love, are doing all the work.&quot;</p>

<p>The bard nodded her head and then Patroclus ushered the two women to a
table and nodded his head at the serving maid, who sauntered off into the kitchen and came
back almost immediately with a tray of full of bowls and dishes laden with vegetables,
potatoes, and meat.</p>

<p>Neither of the women realized how hungry they were until the food was
placed before them. Gabrielle, of course, retrieved her appetite quickly and filled her
plate with the delicacies laid before her. Likewise, Xena managed to down a more than
modest helping of almost everything the Innkeeper lay on the table before them.</p>

<p>All during the meal Xena would glance up when she felt the heat of
staring eyes and give the bearer a warning look that sent a message to be patient. Finally
they finished eating, and the atmosphere of the entire room changed, as if everyone in it
had breathed a sigh of relief all at the same time. The intensity lightened and when the
bard turned to Patroclus and asked where he wanted her to sit for the storytelling, he
ushered her to a high barstool, which had been placed at the head of the middle table, to
assure that everyone could see and hear the storyteller. A round of applause spread across
the room as Gabrielle looked out into the throng of friendly strangers. She noticed that
the table directly in front of her was covered with goblets of wine, and the barmaid
informed her that the drinks were gifts from anxious customers. </p>

<p>The bard smiled sweetly at the crowd and then requested, &quot;Could I
please have a glass of water, also? Sometimes I get parched while telling the story and if
I drank all this wine . . . &quot; the smile that always warmed her warrior's heart, now
lit up this room filled with strangers, &quot; . . . you'd never be able to understand the
ending.&quot; Almost instantly a slew of water glasses instantaneously appeared next to
the goblets; the bard smiled again and cleared her throat. &quot;Just what story would you
like told first?&quot; she inquired.</p>

<p>Vociferous requests from various parts of the room made it almost
impossible to hear any singular behest. Two small hands went up into the air and gently
waved the crowd to silence. &quot;Let's try this a different way. Raise you hands and I'll
call on you; I'll see which stories are the most popular, and we'll pick two from
there.&quot; </p>

<p>Xena's heart swelled with pride as she watched her lover captivate the
audience of townspeople who had hastened to the tavern in an obscure little village, on
the edge of nowhere, to listen to the Bard of Potidaea. Gabrielle had come a long way from
the young peasant girl who begged to tag along with the infamous Warrior Princess and
finally won her heart. She wasn't quite sure where her place in history would be through
all this, but Bard and Amazon Queen were two very notable accomplishments for the young
woman who only wanted to get away from home and make a small difference in the world.
Though the eyes of her warrior, Gabrielle had definitely surpassed her initial goal.</p>

<p>As it turned, out the two stories were on opposite ends of the story
spectrum, the first being the story of Eli and how he came to be known as an Avitar. By
the time the story was finished, Gabrielle had downed two glasses of water and one goblet
of wine, offering most of the remaining intoxicating liquid to Xena. Glancing over at the
dark warrior, the bard sensed a mood of melancholy she couldn't quite figure out. She made
a mental note to ask the warrior what was on her mind when they got back up to their
quarters.</p>

<p>The second request was about the Twilight of the Gods and the rumors
that the God of War was no longer. Gabrielle told the story of how the God, in a weaker
moment, he would probably never admit to, gave up his Godhood to save both her and Eve,
because of his devotion to a long time acquaintance who had done many deeds in his name,
specifically &#150; Xena. She also informed the group that even though he gave up his
mortality and powers, that the Goddess of Love took pity on him and reinstated his powers
and immortality by procuring for him some ambrosia, the food of the Gods.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the second story, the room was still filled with
patrons clamoring for Gabrielle to tell another. Patroclus stood and tried to hush the
audience, proclaiming that the bard had given them quite a full night's entertainment and
was most likely tired from her traveling all day from Potidaea. It seemed that the crowd
did not have ears to hear that the storyteller needed her sleep, until a certain warrior
stood beside her and repeated the words of the Innkeeper.</p>

<p>Slowly the room began to empty as customers came up to shake the bard's
hand and thank her for an enjoyable evening. </p>

<p>Gabrielle was visibly tired and as she finished off the last of her
second goblet of wine, she felt the strong hand of her lover on her shoulder. She turned
her head to face her champion. &quot;Thank you, Xena, for dispersing the audience. I don't
think I could have completed another story tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anytime, my soul, glad I could be of some service.&quot; The blue
eyes again took on a hint of sadness that the blonde did not comprehend. Just as she was
about to ask, the Innkeeper came over and thanked Gabrielle for her performance. She, in
turn, thanked him for the rooms and food.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be silly,&quot; Patroclus insisted, &quot;with what the
crowd here tonight drank and ate, the four of you could stay for a fortnight. If only I
talk you into staying a few extra days, I'd be set for the entire cold season.&quot; The
man smiled at his two visitors, knowing they, especially the bard, must be exhausted after
traveling all day. &quot;Have a good rest and I will make sure your breakfast is
exquisite. Thank you again.&quot; He bowed slightly and left the two women to retire to
their room.</p>

<p>&quot;Guess you could make us quite a living now if you decided to take
your scrolls on the road, oh, phenomenal Bard of Potidaea.&quot; Xena bowed low and got
smacked gently on the head on the way back up.</p>

<p>&quot;No one called for a smart ass,&quot; Gabrielle whispered.
&quot;I'm exhausted. First traveling, then you, then the wine and finally story telling,
don't you dare wake me up early in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me?&quot; Xena pointed to herself with a questioning look.
&quot;Why, Gabrielle, I'm hurt,&quot; she continued sarcastically. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's gotta be the influence of the grape; you are waaay too
silly.&quot; The bard grinned back at her warrior as she placed an arm around her waist
and the two of them started walking back toward their room. &quot;What do you suppose
happened to Eve and Toxaris?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it seems like they set you up for the entertainment and
then took advantage of a full night's sleep.&quot; Xena opened the door to their room.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know about a full night's sleep, perhaps a little fooling
around in the tub and then in the bed and then a good night's sleep. I've got to admit
that bed looks terribly inviting to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It has been a busy day, my love, emotionally and
physically.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And now we're one day closer to your home. Are you getting
anxious Xena? I've noticed you being a little more moody than usual.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Moody? Can't a girl get introspective around you without you
thinking something's wrong? I've just been trying to imagine what Mother looks like.&quot;</p>

<p>With Xena in her nightshirt and Gabrielle in one of the gowns Aphrodite
had given her, they lay down on the bed and in unison let out a moan of exhaustion when
their heads hit the pillows. The warrior lay on her back looking up at the ceiling, trying
to picture her mother's reaction when she saw the three of them. Gabrielle curled up next
to her and wrapped a small arm around Xena's waist.</p>

<p>&quot;I never feel safer than when I'm in your arms.&quot; She repeated
a statement that wasn't new to the warrior's ears, but tonight the bard said it again,
partially because it was true and partially because she felt the warrior needed some
boosting of her morale. The bard couldn't quite put her finger on the cause, but she knew
that something was bothering her soulmate, something other than the trip to Amphipolis.</p>

<p>&quot;You're safe tonight, my soul.&quot; The warrior replied as she
squeezed the smaller woman closer and kissed the crown of her head. &quot;Get some sleep;
tomorrow's another busy day. I promise to let you sleep until you wake up on your own, or
at least until the sun is almost high in the sky, if you haven't gotten up by then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fair enough, Xena. Sweet dreams.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Back at ya, Gabrielle.&quot; The warrior smiled as she held the
other half of her soul and closed her eyes, thanking destiny for allowing her to
experience the love of the small woman whose arms were wrapped around her.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">********************</p>
</B>

<p>Even the warrior overslept the next morning and by the time she dressed
and walked downstairs, Eve and Toxaris were already sitting at one of the tables,
conversing over a cup of tea.</p>

<p>&quot;We thought we'd wait for you and Mom to have breakfast.&quot; Eve
looked over at her mother with a contrite expression.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose that would be a nice gesture after causing Gabrielle to
have to spend her evening telling tales to strangers,&quot; Xena answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but Mom loves being the storyteller; you know that as well as
I do, better even.&quot; Eve retorted. &quot;And it got us free food and lodging to
boot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And what are the two of you going to do for her for your <i><b>free
food and lodging</B></i>?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anything the Queen wants,&quot; Toxaris chimed in.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Eve seconded.</p>

<p>&quot;Good,&quot; Xena concluded. &quot;You can start by waiting until
she wakes up for breakfast. She's exhausted because of you two, so you can stay hungry
because of her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mother . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No lip, Eve . . . that was not a request . . . that was an
order.&quot;</p>

<p>The two younger women mumbled into their cups while Xena went to get a
cup for herself and find out what the owner of the establishment had in mind for the
morning meal.</p>

<p>As Xena sat chatting with the man about events that had transpired in
the area over the past 25 years, she was surprised to feel a familiar touch on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for letting me sleep.&quot; </p>

<p>The statuesque beauty turned to stare into two still slightly puffy but
remarkably beautiful emerald green pools.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle . . . &quot; Xena stammered, &quot;I didn't expect to
see you for a few more candlemarks, but you can be assured that everyone's stomach thanks
you for getting up earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>The small blonde smiled as she touched the warrior on the thigh.
&quot;I think I'm just as anxious as you are to get to Amphipolis and see Cyrene. So . . .
&quot; she turned to Patroclus, &quot; . . . I guess we're ready for that marvelous
morning meal whenever you're ready to make it.&quot; Her friendly smile warmed the
Innkeeper's heart as he headed back toward the kitchen to talk to his wife, the cook. It
was to his good fortune that the warrior and bard happened upon his inn. He overhead the
younger women talking about making a yearly trip in this direction and he wanted to assure
that Acanthus was always a stopping place for them on their way back home, wherever that
happened to be.</p>

<p>As the four women sat discussing the plans for the day, they could
smell the delicious odors drifting through the air. It wasn't long before they were indeed
served a meal fit for a ruler. Eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits, potatoes, fresh juice, and
newly brewed herbal tea were served the visitors. With filled plates they started eating,
only to be surprised as the Innkeeper's wife came back into the room carrying a huge plate
of griddle cakes, her children trailing behind her with warmed butter, honey, and
blueberry syrup.</p>

<p>&quot;By the Gods,&quot; Gabrielle sighed, shaking her head. &quot;Even
my appetite didn't expect this.&quot; She looked up at the wife. &quot;Thank you, this is
definitely a meal fit for royalty. Are you going to sit down and eat with us?&quot;</p>

<p>The wife looked over at her husband, who shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;We hadn't thought about it, but the children are very hungry. If
you're sure you can't finish it all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; The bard shook her head and looked at her companions
who all agreed that there was enough food to feed an army and they were only a small group
of four. &quot;By all means . . . what is your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lykopis, m'lady.&quot; The woman bowed slightly as she spoke to
the bard.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Lykopis . . . Gabrielle will do just fine for me and we
would love to have you and your family join us.&quot;</p>

<p>Without a second thought the three children ran back to the kitchen and
reappeared with plates and utensils, filling their dishes in an orderly manner and then
sitting at the table next to the honored guests. Gabrielle motioned for Lykopis to sit
next to her and Xena offered Patroclus a seat beside to her.</p>

<p>The remainder of the meal was spent getting to know all about the
Innkeeper and his family and the foursome was invited back anytime they found themselves
in the area with the promise of a roof over their heads and food in their bellies.</p>

<p>Eve and Toxaris finished first and headed to the stable to bring the
horses around to the front of the Inn. While Xena and Gabrielle thanked the Innkeeper and
his wife for their hospitality, the younger women loaded the saddlebags with the extra
sacks and packages of foodstuffs that Lykopis insisted on them taking. Before getting out
of the Inn, Xena and Gabrielle were handed two bladders filled with wine and two filled
with juices. With words of thanks all around, the women mounted their horses and resumed
their journey north to Amphipolis.</p>

<p>Because Acanthus was almost exactly halfway between Potidaea and
Amphipolis, Xena informed everyone that they would more than likely find themselves in her
hometown a little after nightfall. The ride was a fairly easy one as the paths were level
and well worn, making the traveling easier on the horses and riders alike. Time went by
quickly, what with discussions on the positive attitudes of the people in Acanthus and
Gabrielle telling another of her stories after being coaxed mercilessly by Toxaris, who,
until recently only heard the stories from other people's memories of what Gabrielle had
written. </p>

<p>There were a few scrolls the bard left behind in the Amazon Village for
the storyteller, but they were mostly of the beginning years, before the bard and her
warrior had professed their love for each other. The stories of their love affair were all
handed down, word-of-mouth and not very accurate. It didn't take much to have the bard
relate the conditions of their first romantic encounter, but she noticed with a smile that
her warrior tended to ride slightly ahead of the troupe when she began to talk of more
personal situations.</p>

<p>Having stopped for lunch along the river, they were able to refill
their water skins and have a picnic lunch. They were all too excited to stop and nap as
they had before and insisted on traveling directly through to their destination.</p>

<p>Before the setting of the sun, Gabrielle could tell from the warrior's
silence and body language that she was beginning to recognize the area they were quickly
approaching. When Xena finally came out of her introspective mood, the warrior announced
to everyone what her lover had already figured out &#150; they were within a candlemark of
Amphipolis and Xena knew exactly where they were.</p>

<p>Little by little Argo inched her way in front of the other horses and
increased her speed. It seemed as though the young horse knew her master was excited and
wanted to get her wherever it was she wanted to be in such a hurry. Again the pace picked
up and before the end of the anticipated time, the four horsewomen were at a steady
gallop. The last leg of the trip was traveled at some speed and the horses were panting
and sweating by the time the village came into sight.</p>

<p>Xena stopped just outside the gates and took a deep breath. She waited
until Ginger was reined beside her and reached over for her lover's hand. &quot;We made
excellent time, Gabrielle.&quot; It was all she could think of to say.</p>

<p>Knowing that her warrior's heart was probably beating almost out of her
chest, the bard squeezed Xena's hand and nodded her head. &quot;Yes, my love, we did. Are
you ready to go see your mother?&quot;</p>

<p>Blue gems glistened as the warrior looked at her soul mate. &quot;As
ready as I'll ever be, Gabrielle. Shall we?&quot;</p>

<p>As the party of four began traveling through the streets, Gabrielle
could see Xena's body reacting to all the changes that had taken place in the past 25
years. Her warrior always did react slowly to change and this seemed to be no exception.
Houses extended beyond the perimeter of the old city, and there was an additional Inn, as
well as many new stores. Amphipolis, like Potidaea, had definitely grown during the duo's
absence. </p>

<p>There was a lump in the dark haired beauty's throat when she dismounted
Argo in front of the house and tied her to the post. She waited for Gabrielle to get down
from Ginger and come to her side.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you like to go in alone, Xena? I'd understand if . . .
&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; came the emphatic answer. &quot;We go in together, but
I'll tell you Gabrielle I'm a little nervous.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked back toward Eve and Toxaris, &quot;Will one of you
girls take care of Ginger for me? I'll come out to get you in a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, Mom,&quot; Eve answered, grabbing the horse's reins.
&quot;Take your time; we're not going anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Slowly the lovers walked hand in hand up the path leading to the house
where Xena grew up. Gabrielle could feel the warrior's palm sweating and squeezed it
tenderly. &quot;Dite said she was fine, so let's just get inside and make your mother the
happiest mother in the known world.&quot; She smiled up at her love, who smiled back down
at her, then bent and kissed her tenderly on the cheek. </p>

<p>&quot;You always know just what to say. That's one of the things I love
about you, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena wasn't sure how she was going to handle the initial meeting. She
didn't want to startle the older woman and anything she could think of to do would
probably do just that. Deciding on just opening the door and slowly entering, she put her
hand on the handle and pushed. As she was opening the door she could smell the scent of
freshly baked bread and lamb stew. The odor took her back much farther than the 25 years
it had been since she stepped foot into this, her childhood home.</p>

<p>What she hadn't been expecting was the voice of a young woman, softly
singing to herself. She shook her head and cocked it to one side, listening intently.
&quot;Do you hear that?&quot; She whispered to Gabrielle.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Xena. I do.&quot; Gabrielle smiled at her lover. &quot;Why
don't you continue on in and find out who it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, right. I was just going to do that.&quot; The warrior moved
farther into the room and inadvertently startled the young woman who was standing over the
basin washing what seemed to be the dinner dishes.</p>

<p>&quot;What . . . &quot;</p>

<p>Xena put her hands up and began to speak when she heard Cyrene's voice
coming from the area of the bedroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena, is something wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>Xena looked at the young woman standing dumbstruck by the basin.
Thinking her mother was probably getting forgetful in her old age and calling people by
other people's names, she put her fingers to her lips to shush the startled woman.
&quot;Nothing's wrong, Mother. We have company.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mother . . . company?&quot; came the confused answer. &quot;Xena
. . . &quot;</p>

<p>It was at this point that mother and daughter met between the two
rooms. Cyrene threw her hands up to her face in disbelief, tears immediately filling her
still brilliant blue eyes. &quot;By the Gods, are my eyes deceiving me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Mother . . . It's me . . . Xena.&quot; The warrior quickly
breached the distance between them and held her mother close to her. &quot;I've come home
to visit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena is it really you . . . not just a figment of my
imagination?&quot; She looked beyond her daughter to the figure standing just inside the
door. &quot;Is that my Gabrielle?&quot; Her arms extended beyond her daughter as she
beckoned the blonde into a group hug.</p>

<p>While all this was happening, the tall blonde at the sink continued to
stare in disbelief at the scene playing out before her. After what seemed like minutes,
the three stopped hugging and crying and kissing on each other and turned to the stunned
young maiden.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena,&quot; Cyrene began after her daughter helped her to a
chair. &quot;This is your namesake, your niece, Xena. Toris and Lavinia were good enough
to humor me and name her after you.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena looked over at her brother's daughter who, except for her hair,
which was the color of Lyceus' she could have been a younger sister to the warrior.</p>

<p>A slight push from Gabrielle set the warrior in motion toward the
younger woman. &quot;Hi, I'm your Aunt Xena.&quot; She grinned as she held out her arms
and embraced her niece. </p>

<p>&quot;And this is Gabrielle,&quot; Cyrene promptly acknowledged.
&quot;My other daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of daughters,&quot; Gabrielle murmured. </p>

<p>&quot;Right . . . &quot; Xena turned back to her mother. &quot;Mother,
Eve is outside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eve? Oh, Xena. Why did you keep her outside?&quot; Cyrene looked
from face to face finding it difficult to believe that her daughter and Gabrielle were
actually standing in front of her and to top it off she was going to see Eve again. She
continued to pray to the Gods, especially after Joxer came to tell her that Ares had taken
the bodies of her daughter and Gabrielle somewhere unknown. Even though she mourned the
loss of Xena and Gabrielle, Cyrene believed that with the God involved there was always a
chance that the two of them might have somehow survived. For 25 years, she refused in her
heart to believe that they were actually dead and now standing before her were the fruits
of her conviction. What she hadn't expected was that Xena and Gabrielle would look as
young and beautiful as they did the last time she laid eyes on them some 25 full seasons
ago; that definitely was going to take some explanation. </p>

<p>With the mention of Eve, Cyrene's mind floated back to the day Joxer
informed her that a Roman patriarch, by the name of Octavius, took her baby granddaughter
to Rome to save her life. She mourned not being able to watch her daughter's baby grow and
figured the child lost to her forever. So many memories began flooding in that she became
unfocused, drifting in time, until she recognized her first born grandchild coming through
the door.</p>

<p>While Eve and Cyrene were getting reacquainted, Xena and Gabrielle
introduced Toxaris to the younger Xena. </p>

<p>&quot;For lack of confusion you can call me Xe the young woman told her
aunt; it's what my twin calls me.</p>

<p>&quot;Twin!? Toris had twins?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually Lavinia had twins,&quot; the quick-witted maiden
replied, laughing.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure I know that,&quot; Xena answered, giving her niece the
trademark infamous arched eyebrow and crooked grin. &quot;So, I have two beautiful nieces
. . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes, you do, but if you're speaking of my twin . . . I
don't think Lyceus would be at all amused to be called a beautiful young woman,&quot; Xe
interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;Lyceus?&quot; Xena and Gabrielle voiced in unison. </p>

<p>&quot;My twin brother,&quot; the younger Xena proclaimed.</p>

<p>&quot;So . . . Mother brought us both back at one time.&quot; Xena
stated, grinning and shaking her head. &quot;Mother never changes.&quot; But as she
watched Cyrene fawning over Eve, the warrior could clearly see that Mother had, indeed,
changed. The now frail and white-haired Cyrene was a mere shadow of the woman she used to
be. As Cyrene gently caressed the face of her oldest grandchild, Xena took a leap back in
time. In her memory, it was but a few months gone, while in the reality of the world they
now lived in 25 years had passed. In her mind's eye, the warrior watched her mother with
her daughter, visualizing a more youthful image of Cyrene, holding a baby Eve in her arms.
Xena cursed destiny for stealing not only her daughter's childhood years but also her
mother's autumn from her as well. She, Gabrielle and Eve still had a lifetime ahead of
them but Cyrene . . . </p>

<p>&quot;Xena . . .&quot; Gabrielle tugged on her arm. &quot;Xena are you
still here with us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, I was lost in thought.&quot; The dark-haired beauty
turned from her mother and daughter to once again face her lover and niece.</p>

<p>&quot;So . . . how is your father? And did you say I have another
niece?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quite well, Aunt Xena,&quot; the young woman smiled as she took
in the expression on her aunt's face when being addressed as such. &quot;You have a
younger niece, Euphrosyne, who grandmother insists on calling <i>Sunny</i> and a nephew,
Ganymede. Euphrosyne is 14 and Ganymede is 16.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well . . . an aunt four times over . . . that's . . .
great.&quot; Xena muddled through the thoughts, trying to contend with the idea of being
an instant aunt four times over.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it will take a little getting used to being called Aunt,
Xe. I think it makes this warrior feel a little old.&quot; Gabrielle grinned and stroked
her lover's back. &quot;Not that she minds,&quot; she added as an afterthought.</p>

<p>&quot;Should I call you Aunt Gabrielle?&quot; Xe wanted to know.</p>

<p>&quot;That's totally up to you . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is family Xe,&quot; her grandmother chimed in unexpectedly,
causing Gabrielle to grin from ear to ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let me put it this way . . . my niece, Gabby, and nephew,
Jason, have decided to call Xena aunt, so it's totally up to you. As your grandmother
mentioned, we are all 'family.' I would, of course, be honored if you decided to do
so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems a little odd calling someone aunt who looks not to be
much older than myself.&quot; Xe observed. &quot;That includes Aunt Xena.&quot; The young
girls smiled at one and then the other of her aunts.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure it does. It's like being called Mom by Eve when she
looks more like a sister than a daughter.&quot; Gabrielle agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;We thought the rumors of your coming back from the dead and
fighting with the Gods were just that, but Grandmother insisted that they were all true.
She kept telling everyone that one day you and Aunt Xena would return, but no one believed
her. They all called her a crazy old woman. Guess she'll show them all who is crazy
now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Won't be the first time,&quot; Xena acknowledged. &quot;I suppose
Gabrielle and I have given her more than enough pause to be considered odd by the rest of
the villagers, but she's always possessed faith in us.&quot;</p>

<p>As astonishment started to die down, conversations became more
normalized. </p>

<p>&quot;Come here, girls,&quot; Cyrene summoned the four still standing
by the door to join her and Eve at the table. &quot;Xe would you get everyone some tea and
nutbread?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd be happy to Grandmother, but I think maybe they might want
some bread and stew first.&quot;</p>

<p>The visitors all nodded in agreement, having not eaten since midday.
The aroma of the stew set their gastric juices flowing and rumbling sounds could be heard
coming from the direction of all four of them at once.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll help,&quot; Toxaris volunteered, feeling a tad out of place
at such an emotional family reunion.</p>

<p>Throughout the meal and the remainder of the evening the conversation
bounced between the past and the present. Xena and Gabrielle wanted to know all about what
had transpired over the years, how Toris was and about the births of all the children. </p>

<p>Xe wanted to know about Amazons, warriors, fighting Gods, Eli, and all
the exciting aspects of her aunts' lives.</p>

<p>Cyrene smiled a lot as she looked from one face to the other and she
cried some when Gabrielle informed her that Joxer was dead. Tonight was not the time to
disclose to her how, so in her bardic way she avoided the actual circumstances of their
best friend's death. </p>

<p>She told her daughters that Xe had been living with her for a few years
now, helping with the chores that she found difficult to do and working in one of the
small shops in the middle of town. She also informed Xena that Lyceus had taken old man
Cadmus' place as the apothecary for the town and that he was married with a child.</p>

<p>&quot;So, not only are we aunts . . . we're actually great aunts.&quot;
Xena again shook her head, &quot;Unbelievable.&quot;</p>

<p>Eve and Toxaris mostly listened to everyone else chatter, except when
they were cleaning the dishes and talking to Xe about the Amazon village, or when Eve was
filling her cousin in on how she was raised as a Roman patrician.</p>

<p>The sky was beginning to lighten when Xena looked over at her mother
and realized that sometime during the last conversation, she had fallen asleep. Without
waking her, the warrior, under the watchful eye of her bard, picked up the mere slip of a
woman and carried her to bed, gently laying her down and then returning to the front room.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe we should all take a hint from Mother and get some sleep
before the sun is fully up and we've not slept at all.&quot;</p>

<p>No one argued the point, but they needed to figure out where everyone
was going to sleep.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I have your old room Aunt Xena. You and Aunt Gabrielle
are more than welcome to use it while you're here,&quot; the young woman offered. </p>

<p>&quot;That shouldn't be necessary, but thank you for the offer,
Xe.&quot; It was the first time ever that Xena would not sleep in her own bed upon a visit
home, but she was grateful to her niece for living in the house and helping to take care
of Cyrene. &quot;Let's see,&quot; Xena scratched her head. &quot;I know I should either
flip for it or offer the extra room to you girls, but I'm not that generous.&quot; She
smiled over at Gabrielle and then at Toxaris and Eve. &quot;So, one of you gets the couch
and the other a pallet in front of the . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait . . . that's ridiculous,&quot; Xe interrupted. &quot;My . .
. rather Aunt Xena's old bed is large enough for her and Aunt Gabrielle. There are two
single beds in the spare room. Aunt Xena, I insist on you and Aunt Gabrielle taking the
bedroom and Toxaris and Eve taking the spare room. This is my home now and if nothing
else, Grandmother taught me to be a good hostess.&quot; She smiled over at her aunt who
was definitely not used to having other people make the decisions. &quot;I have no problem
with sleeping on the couch; the Gods know I've done it often enough before. It's really
rather comfortable, and that way no one has to sleep on a pallet.&quot;</p>

<p>Eve and Toxaris started to protest the young woman's wanting to give up
sleeping in a bed, but Gabrielle put a stop to the bickering, stating that it really
probably was the best solution and no one would be more the worse for wear for sleeping on
a couch.</p>

<p>Within half a candlemark everyone was wherever they were supposed to be
and almost before heads hit pillows Morpheus took control of their dreams. No one saw the
beautiful morning sky as the sun made her first appearance of the day. In fact, it was
close to midday when the first of the night owls opened her startling blue eyes.
Recognition came quickly as Xena glanced around the room and realized that she was
sleeping in the bed of her youth. She pulled Gabrielle closer, kissing the soft golden
crown. The warrior felt an unaccustomed need to put thoughts to words, so she whispered
into the air, &quot;I can't believe we're actually here. Except for the new people added
to the family and the fact that Mother has aged so, I feel as though we're merely coming
home for a normal visit, not one after a hiatus of 25 years.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle stirred in her arms and mumbled something ending with <i>'Xena'</i>
but the rest of the words were indistinguishable. The warrior smiled and was about to kiss
the golden head below her chin, when she heard a rattling around in the front of the
house; ever so gently, she unwrapped the smaller woman's arm from around her and got out
of bed. Within minutes she was dressed and heading for the kitchen.</p>

<p>Sunlight streamed into the house and memories of yesteryear drifted
through the Warrior Princess' head as she beheld the familiar visage of her mother
preparing the morning meal. It didn't matter that she was now a grown woman, or that her
mother was now an aged crone; the sight of that long ago ritual turned back the hands of
time and threw the warrior tenderly into the role of being a child.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I help, Mother?&quot; Xena questioned as she approached the
older woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, Xena.&quot; Cyrene looked at her daughter with the
gleam of love only a mother could produce in blue eyes that had kept their sparkle and
youth, even when the rest of her body gave way to aging. &quot;I can always use your
help.&quot; She smiled and nodded for her daughter to come closer. &quot;No need waking
anyone else until the meal is ready . . . gives us a little time alone . . . I've missed
you and Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior tried to keep the hot liquid from stinging her eyes, but to
no avail. Tears welled and overflowed down her face. &quot;We missed you too,
Mother.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Now, now, Xena, I know it must be difficult coming home and
having everyone so changed. We're the lucky ones, after all these many years we get to see
you again, and you still look exactly as we remembered you. It's a comfort for me to know
that you and Gabrielle didn't lose all those years to yourselves as well as losing them to
us. You still have the opportunity to live the years your situation stole from us.&quot;
She pulled her daughter to her bosom and held the child within the warrior tightly.
&quot;I'm just happy you girls came home for a visit, Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me, too, Mom.&quot; Xena steadied her emotions, and the two began
discussing in detail the childhoods' of the nieces and nephews. Soon the conversation
turned Joxer and after talking about the visit he made to Amphipolis years ago, Cyrene
finally asked Xena, point blank, how their best friend died. It was with a heavy heart
that Xena told the story of Livia/Eve and the transition that took place after the baptism
by water. Cyrene cried for both the man and the woman who killed him and then shook the
sorrow away. </p>

<p>&quot;Today is a day of rejoicing; I know you won't be staying long,
and I want everything to be perfect while you are all here.&quot; Cyrene commented softly.</p>

<p>Xena smiled, thinking that her mother's positive outlook had always
been a great comfort and even in the winter of her life she kept that bit of summer.</p>

<p>&quot;You're absolutely right, Mother . . . and . . . before I forget
to mention it . . . Gabrielle and I . . . I asked Gabrielle to join with me in a formal
Amazon ceremony when we get back to the Village.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena.&quot; Her mother's face shone with excitement. &quot;I'm so
happy for you girls. You've been through so much together, a commitment ceremony seems
like the appropriate decision at this point in your lives; you have many good years ahead
of you.&quot; The older woman turned toward the stove and began stirring the contents a
pot that was not, in any way, in need of attention. The change in body language was not
lost on her daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Mother, we initially began this trip to ask you and Lila to come
home with us and be part of the ceremony. I know now that it was a foolish dream. But we
know you'll be there in thought and that's why I told you. I didn't do it to make you
sad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not sad, Xena.&quot; The brilliant smile returned to the
older woman's lips. &quot;No one knows better than I that such an extensive trip would not
be possible for me, but I am blessed to have been able to see the three of you
again.&quot; She looked at her daughter and then it seemed as though a new light came into
her eyes. &quot;But Xe could go in my place. She would love that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who would help you around here if Xe went with us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could have Ganymede and Sunny take turns visiting, no problem
at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really think Xe would want . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Want to,&quot; The voice of the young woman being talked about
interrupted into the conversation, &quot;I would be thrilled to get to see an Amazon
village.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena turned to look at Xe, the color in her cheeks darkening as blood
rushed through them. &quot;It's just that . . .&quot; The warrior shrugged her shoulders,
almost at a loss for words. &quot;You know . . . I didn't know if you . . . &quot; she
stopped and looked toward her mother for support &quot; . . . Amazons are different from .
. .&quot;</p>

<p>Finally Cyrene chimed in, relieving her daughter of the awkward
situation. &quot;How could I tell your nieces and nephews about you and not mention the
one great love in your life, Xena? Love you, love Gabrielle . . . the two go hand-in-hand
as you two have done since the day you met her. I believe I knew you loved her even before
you did but felt that you needed to realize it yourself, before we could talk about it
openly.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you knew Mother,&quot; Xena professed. &quot;And I know
how much you love Gabrielle. I just didn't know how you dealt with telling the rest of the
family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the operative word, daughter . . . family . . . and we all
love you for who you are and we love Gabrielle, too. After all, if it wasn't for . . .
&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle,&quot; Xena finished her mother's sentence. &quot;I
would be a totally different person today. Enough said, I understand that you all
understand and it makes me feel very special.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are special Aunt Xena; not many people have the honor to
state that they are related to a Warrior Princess and an Amazon Queen!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, not you, too.&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed as she stepped
into the kitchen in the middle of the conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; The younger woman looked totally confused.</p>

<p>&quot;First my niece Gabby and now you, what's with this 'Warrior
Princess, Amazon Queen' fixation? You two are too much!&quot; She was laughing as she
walked across the kitchen to give Cyrene a morning hug. &quot;I slept as soundly as I
always do when under your roof, Cyrene.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle, don't you think it's time you referred to me as <i>Mom</i>?&quot;
There was a twinkle in the eyes that still identically matched those of her lover's.</p>

<p>With her eyes misting over, the bard looked first at the older woman,
over to her champion and then back again. &quot;Yes . . . Mom . . . I do believe it is
time.&quot; As a tear trickled down her fair face, the blonde gave her mother-in-law
another hug and a kiss on the cheek. </p>

<p>&quot;So, shall we wake the two missing Amazons and get to
eating?&quot; Xena quickly lightened the atmosphere in the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; Gabrielle agreed with having breakfast
as soon as possible and started walking out of the room on her way to awaken the sleepy
heads.</p>

<p>During the meal the discussion led to how they were going to spend the
remainder of the day and evening. Xena promised her mother that they would stay the night
again and perhaps even one more day before starting back to the Village. She explained how
it would have normally been a two-day excursion, but that now they had a unique mode of
transportation that took one entire day off the return trip. </p>

<p>While everyone was helping to clean up after breakfast, Xe suggested
that she walk over to her father's house and invite the family to dinner. Toxaris offered
to give her a ride and the proposal was immediately accepted.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to drop me off out of sight, though. I don't want
Mother to have any idea that we have company; she might forget and unintentionally let it
slip to Father. Could we also stop by Lyceus' home? I'd like to give my sister-in-law a
little time to get herself and Phoebe ready and make sure she doesn't start making her own
supper.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, we can go anywhere you'd like,&quot; the Amazon replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you girls be too long,&quot; Cyrene cautioned. &quot;Xena
wants to see all the changes that have occurred in Amphipolis since her last visit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Last visit,&quot; the warrior chuckled. &quot;I guess that's one
way of looking at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riding won't take us very long Grandmother. Besides, I have to go
into the shop for a few candlemarks this afternoon. While I'm there I'll talk to Tescalus
about taking some time off. Lyceus isn't going to believe it when you pop in on him at
work.&quot; The young woman was giddy with excitement.</p>

<p>Xe's hand was on the door when Xena called over to her. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you know how to ride, Xe?&quot;</p>

<p>The young woman looked startled, &quot;Of course, I've been riding
almost since I've been old enough to walk. Father made sure all of us received lessons.
It's just that I don't have a horse of my own right now. Lyceus' lost his in an accident
and Cassia's pregnant so he doesn't like to leave her without transportation. I lent him
mine. He usually comes and gets me for work on my early mornings; when I go in late, I
walk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case why don't you take Ginger.&quot; Xena suggested.</p>

<p>Gabrielle shot her lover a quick look of disbelief and then shook her
head smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a good idea, Xe.&quot; The bard agreed. &quot;Would you
like to ride Ginger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that would be fabulous, thanks Aunt Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're very welcome, Xe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess you don't need me to tag along,&quot; Toxaris added
slightly dejected.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you're more than welcome to come along for the ride,
Toxaris,&quot; Xe informed the Amazon. &quot;In fact, it would still be a good idea, that
way you could keep Ginger with you out of sight, while I walked on up to the houses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Toxaris agreed. <i>Now the three who need to be alone
together for a while will finally get a chance. </i>&quot;I'm ready when you are.&quot;</p>

<p>After Xe and Toxaris left on horseback the four remaining women
finished cleaning up and then made a pot of tea and sat out on the front porch to
reminisce; there was so much to catch up on and so little time to do it. A few candlemarks
later the riders arrived back at the house. Xe was still excited, as she had carefully
avoided telling her mother and sister-in-law why they were being invited for dinner on
such short notice and for no specific reason. Of course, the idea of not having to cook
appealed to them both, until Xe asked her mom to bring a couple pies and her sister-in-law
to make her famous vegetable combo. Cyrene made bread the day before so there would be
plenty of fresh rolls to go around.</p>

<p>It was almost midday and Xe needed to check in at work. Xena suggested
that she ride with her and they would pick her up on their way back after she showed Eve
and Toxaris the town. Cyrene shooed them all on their way and said she intended to start
dinner early so there would be no rushing when everyone arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you plan on having for dinner, Mother? I know we've
popped in on you rather unexpectedly.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I thought perhaps I might be able to add to what was left of last
night's stew and . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Mom,&quot; Gabrielle replied. &quot;I think we finished the
stew off last night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, you and Gabrielle get the potatoes and carrots cleaned
and peeled.&quot; Xena proposed. &quot;Eve, Toxaris, and I will go ahead and get a few
rabbits &#150; we're going to have quite a few hungry mouths to feed tonight &#150; damn
&#150; there're 13 of us. I think we need at least four of those little varmints to make a
decent meal.&quot; She turned to Xe, &quot;You go ahead and take Ginger to work; Gabrielle
can ride behind me on Argo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure, Aunt Xena?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Positive . . . now run along and do what you have to do. Get home
when you can to help you grandmother, just in case we aren't back yet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure . . . great . . . &quot; The young woman gave her
grandmother a hug and kiss and did the same for her aunts, then ran out the door as she
was already close to being late. &quot;See you in a while,&quot; she yelled back from the
front yard.</p>

<p>&quot;She's absolutely lovely, Mom.&quot; Gabrielle noted, while
looking out the front window as the younger Xena mounted Ginger and took off in the
direction of the middle of town.</p>

<p>&quot;She certainly has been a blessing to me.&quot; Cyrene admitted.
&quot;I don't know what I'd do without her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Xena turned to Eve and Toxaris. &quot;You two ready
to do some quick hunting?&quot;</p>

<p>The reply came in the form of a simultaneous affirmative and the young
women laughed at their enthusiasm to get out and go 'kill' something. </p>

<p>&quot;I'll get my bow and arrows from the barn,&quot; Toxaris said as
she headed for the door. &quot;Will we need the horses?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I think it's best to go out to the woods,&quot; Xena
replied. &quot;There's apt to be more game available there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least with the three of you going, it shouldn't take you very
long,&quot; Gabrielle commented. &quot;But you'd better get going if you want to have time
to show Eve and Toxaris around while the sun is still high.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena walked over and gave her mother a hug and a kiss and then kissed
Gabrielle on the cheek. &quot;We won't be long; you're right, with three expert hunters,
this should be a piece of cake.&quot; She smiled and then turned and left two of the most
important women in her life in the kitchen, while she hurried to join the third out in the
barn. </p>

<p>&quot;I thought they'd never leave,&quot; Gabrielle kidded as she
turned back to Cyrene. &quot;I guess you and I will get caught up on some good gossip now,
without Xena shushing me, huh Mom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't we always?&quot; The older woman smiled at the blonde.</p>

<p>They decided that they would probably need more bread so Cyrene started
on the dough while Gabrielle began peeling the vegetables. While they worked, they talked
about the situations that were difficult to discuss with Xena and Eve in the house. The
blonde went into greater depth about the battle with the Gods and Eve's transformation.
She also elaborated on the lighter side about their friendship with the Goddess of Love
and how, if it hadn't of been for her taking them up to Mt. Olympus in the first place,
she and Eve would probably not have been around today. Ares was the one who eventually
gave his mortality and Godhood for their lives but Aphrodite was the messenger, without
whom they wouldn't have even been there to be saved.</p>

<p>Of course as the day progressed they also talked about the wedding
plans and what kind of a ceremony Gabrielle wanted to have. Cyrene lived vicariously
through the young woman's telling of her dreams and thanked the Gods, once again, that her
Xena found the young bard all those many years ago.</p>

<p>The afternoon went by quickly and before the two women realized how
late it was, they heard the hoof beats of horses as the three hunters returned.</p>

<p>Eve was the first through the door, carrying four already skinned and
cleaned rabbits. Toxaris came through next and told Cyrene that Xena was hanging the skins
in the barn. They cleaned up by the well and were now ready to have a guided tour of
Amphipolis. </p>

<p>&quot;We have everything pretty much under control here,&quot; Cyrene
declared when Xena came through the door, looking around to see what the women had
accomplished while the 'hunters' were out procuring tonight's dinner. </p>

<p>&quot;I'll put the rabbits and vegetables into the pot and then into
the oven.&quot; Cyrene informed Xena. &quot;Then I'm going to take a little nap, while the
four of you visit Amphipolis.&quot; Seeing the look of involuntary sadness cross her
daughter's face, she smiled sweetly. &quot;It's okay Xena, it's been a gradual
metamorphosis for me; I'm really quite used to it.&quot; </p>

<p>The younger woman turned away from her mother, pretending she heard
something rustling outside the window, but her actions fooled no one in the room.</p>

<p>The remainder of the afternoon flew by as quickly as the morning and
early afternoon had. Figuring there were about three candlemarks remaining, before Toris
and Lyceus would be off work, they headed first for the apothecary shop.</p>

<p>When the statuesque warrior made her entrance into the shop, flanked by
three beautiful Amazons, heads turned to follow their movements. Xena looked around and
instantly her eyes were drawn to a gorgeous young man standing behind the counter
thoroughly immersed in his work as he was measuring out some powder for a customer with a
sick child. Putting a hand on Gabrielle's shoulder she leaned down and whispered in the
bard's ear. &quot;By the Gods Gabrielle, he's the spitting image of my Lyceus. It's like
stepping back in time.&quot; She squeezed the blonde's shoulder then released it as she
traveled toward the counter with her entourage following close behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I help you?&quot; The young man looked up from his chore and
into intense blue eyes that immediately struck a chord in his heart. He swallowed hard as
he, for a second, thought he was looking into the eyes of his grandmother. Shaking off the
distraction, he repeated his question. &quot;I'm sorry, can I help you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure . . . you want to come around here and give me a hug?&quot;
The request coming from the tall, beautiful, warrior shook the young man to his toes.</p>

<p>&quot;E-x-c-u-s-e me?&quot; He stammered. With an even more confused
look, he glanced over at the blonde standing beside the warrior. He couldn't understand
why she was trying so desperately to stifle a laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Lyceus, right?&quot; The warrior asked in a stern voice, her
penetrating eyes catching and holding those of like color.</p>

<p>The man's full attention was shifted back to the stunning dark-haired
woman standing before him. &quot;That's right. And you are?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This,&quot; Xena said, pointing to the woman standing beside her,
and ignoring his question completely, &quot;is Toxaris, an Amazon warrior.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you are . . . &quot; The young man tried to repeat his
question, barely looking in the direction of the aforementioned Amazon.</p>

<p>The tall warrior again interrupted his train of thought. &quot;This is
another Amazon, an Amazon Princess, to be exact.&quot; Xena continued to ignore his query
and pointed to Eve.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, huh . . . and what does all this have to do with . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And finally . . .&quot; Xena continued, her hand on her lover's
shoulder, &quot;Lyceus, let me introduce you to not only an Amazon Queen, but also
Gabrielle, the Bard of Potidaea.&quot;</p>

<p>If she didn't think she had his undivided attention before, she surely
was receiving it now. He took a step backward and covered his mouth with his hand as an
involuntary gasp escaped his throat. Shaking his head he began to speak and this time his
aunt let him finish.</p>

<p>&quot;If those two ladies are Amazons and the lady beside you is
Gabrielle, the Bard of Potidaea, then you could be none other than . . . <b>NO</B> . . .
This is some kind of a joke . . . my sister put you up to this didn't she? She's always
pulling nonsense like this on me . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lyceus,&quot; Gabrielle interjected. &quot;Take a really good
look at the warrior before you. The stature, the features, the poise, the striking
sapphire blue eyes, don't doubt your first reaction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Xena?&quot; The final realization came as a whisper.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice to meet you Lyceus, now come on around here and give me a
hug.&quot;</p>

<p>Without another moment's hesitation the young man actually jumped the
counter and landed directly in front of his aunt, who he promptly enveloped in his arms.</p>

<p>&quot;If I was Father's age, I would imagine you would be picking me up
off the floor about this time, Aunt Xena.&quot; The young man confessed.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll see if that happens tonight at dinner.&quot; Xena smiled
and hugged him again and then put him out at arm's length. &quot;Do you know how much you
look like your namesake, Lyceus?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As a matter of fact, yes, Aunt Xena. I think Grandmother spent
the first five years of my life telling me and occasionally she still gets that far away
look in her eyes. I think she loved your brother very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We all did, Lyceus.&quot; Just saying the name and looking at his
handsome face made her heart happy. &quot;We all did.&quot;</p>

<p>Introductions were made again, this time informing the young man of
Eve's relationship to him and reiterating about seeing him at dinner. A small crowd was
beginning to form around the counter and Xena told Lyceus to go on back to work and they
would see him at his grandmother's in a few candlemarks.</p>

<p>There was just about enough time to take a quick look around the town
and have Xena point out some of the more interesting aspects of Amphipolis. Just like
Potidaea, this area had grown enormously in the 25 years the duo had been frozen in the
ice cave. All the same, Xena still recognized the landmarks that had been around since her
youth.</p>

<p>Before the sun fell too low on the horizon the small group started back
to the house. Ginger was already in the barn when they got there and Xe and Cyrene had
begun putting out dishes and glass for the anticipated dinner. The smell of roast rabbit
filled their nostrils and their salivary glands told them they were all hungrier than
anticipated as they entered the door to the home.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Gabrielle announced approaching the kitchen,
&quot;what can we do to help?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we're certainly not going to be able to fit everyone at the
table.&quot; Cyrene admitted, looking at the dining area. &quot;The weather is really
beautiful, so if you want to we could eat outside. There's a larger table out back that
might fit all of us and benches instead of chairs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We could take two chairs out for the ends of the table &#150;
that would give us more room,&quot; Gabrielle stated, grabbing a damp cloth to clean the
table and heading out the door. Xena grabbed two chairs and followed close behind her.</p>

<p>&quot;This will do just fine,&quot; the bard acknowledged looking at
the large, planked, wooden table. &quot;It looks like it's been years since this has been
used.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena smiled as she placed the chairs at the head and foot of the table.
&quot;Yes, but we had some wonderful parties sitting around this table. Holidays were
always busy around here.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior's ears perked up as she heard the sound of horses coming
down the road. &quot;I have a feeling we've got company.&quot; With her warrior's stance
hiding the butterflies in the pit of her stomach, she put her arm around Gabrielle and
gave the smaller woman a quick kiss. &quot;I love you, my soul, let's go reacquaint
ourselves with the family.&quot;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">********************</p>
</B>

<p>The evening was a marvelous mixture of the old and the new with
children and spouses being introduced and brother and sister reuniting. Twenty-five years
is a lifetime for some people, and it was difficult to fit everything everyone wanted to
know into the short span of one evening. Often when Gabrielle or Xena would glance over at
Cyrene they would see the look of utter contentment on the older woman's face, as she sat
with her entire family filling her house with the sound of talking, and laughter. Four
generations had been brought together on this auspicious occasion and the warrior and her
bard were exceedingly glad they decided to make this trip before their wedding.</p>

<p>Partway through the evening Gabrielle noticed that Xe had gotten
extremely quiet and went over to talk to the young woman. </p>

<p>&quot;Is something bothering you?&quot; Gabrielle asked.</p>

<p>&quot;A little.&quot; Tears welled up in the striking blue eyes as she
turned to her newly acquired aunt. &quot;I can't get away from the shop for at least a
week, Aunt Gabrielle. Tescalus told me I could have tomorrow off, but that he had to make
an emergency trip to Athens and I was the only person he trusted enough to keep the shop
open. I know you aren't able to wait for me that long. . . I was so looking forward to
going with you.&quot; Now the tears were flowing freely and the bard held the younger
woman close, trying to console her. &quot;Don't worry, Xe, we'll figure something out. If
you want to be at the wedding, I promise &#150; we'll find a way to get you there.&quot;</p>

<p>Toxaris had been wandering around the room and overhead the end of the
conversation. She saw that Xe was upset and felt secure enough in her relationship with
Gabrielle to ask why. When the bard explained the situation, Toxaris smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be happy to come back down and escort you to the Village,
Xe. Listen, Eve will be all tied up in the preparations for the joining and I'll most
likely be standing around with nothing to do. I'll grab an extra friend for company on the
way down and we'll come get you, no problem. I'm sure Xena will be able to make us a
map.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'd do that for me,&quot; Xe sobbed.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure . . . we're family . . . remember.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled and patted Toxaris on the shoulder. &quot;Thanks,
Toxaris that's wonderful.&quot; Then she turned back to her niece. &quot;See . . . have
you now learned that before getting yourself all upset for candlemarks, the wise thing to
do is tell someone about the problem. It didn't turn out to be such a disaster after
all.&quot; </p>

<p>With the dilemma taken care of Gabrielle went back to join the
festivities, while Toxaris and Xe stood talking of the forthcoming trip they would be
making. The remainder of the evening soon disappeared into early morning. Not having heard
her mother's voice in a while, Xena looked around until she spotted Cyrene asleep in her
rocker with Phoebe in the same condition, sitting on her lap. The warrior smiled at the
touching picture of the oldest and youngest of her relatives clinging lovingly to each
other while the God of Dreams, by the looks of it, supplied both of them with pleasant
images.</p>

<p>As it was now well into the early morning hours, and knowing that work
would come within the next few candlemarks, Toris gathered up his family and, after
conversing with Lavinia, invited everyone over to his house for dinner tonight. Lyceus
gathered his small clan and soon the noise and excitement diminished and the house was
once again quiet. It was decided that there would be no cleaning up until later and all
the women retired to their respective rooms to attain a few candlemarks of shut-eye before
beginning the day anew.</p>
<b>

<p>Knowing that this day would be the last spent in Amphipolis for a
while, none of the women seemed to be in need of an overabundance of sleep. They were all
up and flitting around within a few candlemarks of going to sleep. Toxaris and Eve
straightened up while Gabrielle and Cyrene made something for them all to eat. Xena
motioned for Xe to come outside with her and asked if there were any pressing repairs that
needed to be done around the house that perhaps Lyceus or Toris might not be able to get
around to fixing in the near future. She found that her niece had been named rightly, as
she was almost as capable as her aunt was when it came to keeping the house in good
repair. Instead of going back inside and helping with the menial tasks, the two sat on the
large table in the back and got to know each other a little better. Xena was particularly
interested in why a young woman as beautiful as Xe didn't talk of any suitors.</p>

<p>The younger woman blushed as she informed her aunt that she had no
desire to be tied down to a house and children, at least not at this stage in her life.
She wanted to travel and study but felt obligated to stay around, at least until
Euphrosyne was old enough to take her place for a while. She refused to leave Cyrene alone
and didn't think her younger sister was mature enough to stay alone with the older woman.</p>

<p>&quot;That's very commendable of you Xe, but you can't live you life
for Mother. Does she know your desires?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not all of them, Aunt Xena. I don't want her to feel like she's
holding me back; I love her very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure you do, but you're not giving her the credit she's due.
Mother would be fine if Ganymede and Euphrosyne could just take turns checking on her. I'm
sure Toris and Lyceus could handle the house repairs, and Lavinia and Cassia seem to love
her like a mother. Don't you think they would be more than happy to help with the cooking
and cleaning if she needed it? You need to get on with you life, and if you were to put
the question to Mother, I'm sure she would tell you the exact same thing.&quot;</p>

<p>The younger woman smiled at her aunt and reached over to touch her arm.
&quot;You know there are many nights when I think Grandmother forgets which Xena I am. She
says some things that don't relate at all to me.&quot; There was a gleam of pride in the
younger woman's sapphire eyes. &quot;She's told me on more than one occasion that she was
glad Father agreed to call me Xena, because as it turned out I am very much like she
expected you would have been if Cortese never made it to our village.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad you've been here for her all these years Xe.&quot; The
warrior reached over and pulled the younger version of herself into a loving embrace. Then
she started to chuckle, &quot;I'm surprised Mother didn't try to talk you into coloring
your hair.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Aunt Xena!&quot; The younger woman laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, I'm sure Gabrielle will be looking for us soon, better
to make the entrance on our own, rather than to be dragged back into the house on
command.&quot;</p>

<p>The remainder of the day and evening followed fairly close to that of
the day before, except that the group made a side trip to Lyceus' house to visit with
Cassia and play with Phoebe. Dinner at Toris' was quiet enjoyable and then the house began
to shrink as news had spread throughout the town that Xena and the bard from Potidaea had
come to visit. Friends and friends of friends of Toris' and Lyceus' came calling, as well
as old acquaintances of Xena's and new members of their families. </p>

<p>Once again Gabrielle was asked to perform, and as usual she was more
than happy to oblige. The evening disappeared far too quickly and as the moon rose to it's
highest point, Cyrene mentioned that the visiting women had a long day's journey ahead of
them that would begin far earlier than expected, if they didn't manage to get at least a
little sleep.</p>

<p>Cassia handed Gabrielle a sack of cookies to take on the trip and gave
Xena a skin of homemade wine. Over the years Lavinia had heard the 'nutbread' tale more
than once from Cyrene's lips and made sure her new sister-in-law had a couple loaves to
take with her and share on the trip home. </p>

<p>It was difficult saying goodbye to everyone and leaving for the short
jaunt back to Cyrene's, but it was an easy chore, compared to what they knew they would be
feeling the next morning as they were saying their final good-byes and heading north.<b> </p>
</B>

<p>Xena spent a small amount of quiet time talking to Cyrene after
everyone else had bedded down and was still holding her mother's hand when the woman
finally could keep her eyes open no longer and nodded off to sleep. The warrior sat on the
edge of the bed with hot tears silently trickling down her cheeks, knowing in her heart
that this might be the last time she would behold the image of the woman who had brought
her into the world and who loved her so dearly. Instead of going back into her own bed,
Cyrene's daughter curled up at the bottom of her mother's bed and in the silence of the
old familiar room, willed herself to sleep.</p>

<p>There was a mixture of joy and sadness with the rising of the sun. No
one needed to be nudged from sleep, as everyone seemed to awaken simultaneously when
Apollo rode his chariot across the sky and chased away the darkness. The kitchen was a
solemn place on this bright new morning, and small talk caught in the throats of the women
who tried to find something witty and light to talk about. </p>

<p>Finally, Cyrene lightened the atmosphere with an unexpected
exclamation. &quot;Girls, if this is any indication of the mood surrounding my funeral,
I'll simply have to refuse to die.&quot;</p>

<p>Looks of confusion crossed the faces of all the women present as they
turned and stared in the direction of the old woman. Upon receiving their total
concentration, she broke into an ear-to-ear smile. </p>

<p>&quot;This has been a marvelous reunion ladies, one which I prayed for,
but never in all my years, actually expected to come to fruition. Please . . . let's not
ruin the past few days with a sorrowful ending. This old heart of mine has not been this
filled with joy in years. To have my entire family gathered, in this house all at one time
was a dream come true. Now &#150; let's have no more pouting and finish breakfast so the
four of you can get yourselves headed home; you have a wedding to prepare for.&quot;</p>

<p>The ice having been broken and words of joy overriding the feelings of
sorrow in everyone's heart, the atmosphere lightened and the meal became a pleasant event.</p>

<p>Hiding the heaviness in their hearts, the inevitability of farewells
finally arrived.</p>

<p>In an almost orderly fashion each of the women took their turn saying
goodbye first to Xe and then to Cyrene. Toxaris reaffirmed that she would be back to
escort Xe to the Amazon Village in one cycle of the moon, as it would take that long to
get the celebration prepared. She thanked Cyrene for her hospitality, and then turned and
walked toward her horse.</p>

<p>While Toxaris was talking to Cyrene, Eve said goodbye to Xe. Each in
turn, the women continued on until there was not a dry eye between them.</p>

<p>Gabrielle finished saying goodbye to Cyrene. Xena hugged her niece and
said they would be expecting to see her again very soon. </p>

<p>It was then that the warrior turned to her mother and slowly walked
into her extended arms. Gabrielle could tell from the stance of her warrior that Xena's
knees were weak as she stood saying goodbye to the woman she might never have the
opportunity to hold in her arms again. Wrapped in her mother's embrace and with a lump in
her throat the daughter held her mother tightly to her chest and kissed the snow-capped
head of the woman she loved so deeply. &quot;We'll be back to visit again, Mother, I
promise,&quot; she whispered softly.</p>

<p>&quot;I know Xena. You, Gabrielle and Eve have made me a very happy
woman and I'm thrilled that young Xena will be able to attend your wedding. She'll come
home and tell me all about it, don't you worry. I'll be able to have the memories through
her eyes. I love you, daughter, now go . . . have an uneventful journey . . . and keep
Gabrielle and my granddaughter safe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will mother.&quot; She let loose her hold on the older woman
and looked over at her niece, mouthing the words, <i>&quot;You take care of her for
me.&quot;</p>
</i>

<p>Xe nodded in return and watched as her heroic aunt slowly mounted Argo
and turned once more to glance at the home of her youth. </p>

<p>With hands waving high in the air, the foursome trotted away, and the
beginning of the final leg of their journey home was begun.</p>
