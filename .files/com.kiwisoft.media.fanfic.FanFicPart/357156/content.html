<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 9: A Dangerous Game-->

<p>In the Bronze, Buffy, Willow and Oz were sitting at the bar, nursing sodas and snacks. Cordelia and Xander walked up behind them and took the empty stools next to their friends. They needed to decide what to do for the Homecoming dance.</P>
<p>"So what are we going to do?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"I think we should get a limo." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>"A limo?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah."</P>
<P>"A big, expensive limo?"</P>
<P>"That sounds like fun! And it is our last Homecoming Dance, so maybe we should make a big deal of it." Willow said.</P>
<P>"You wanna talk fun? Public bus. You meet the funnest people." Xander said.</P>
<p>Everyone looked at him like he was insane.</P>
<P>"Back me up here, Oz."</P>
<P>"Well, if it's a dollar issue, we could all take my van."</P>
<P> "Van? The Homecoming Queen doesn't go to the dance in a van. Use your head." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>Willow rolled her eyes.</P>
<p>"What’s the point? The dance is here, in the Bronze, and in case you haven’t noticed, it is within walking distance." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"That doesn’t matter. The Homecoming Queen is supposed to arrive in style."</P>
<P>"Well, technically, you haven't been elected yet..." Xander started. Cordelia shot him a look. "Although you certainly and without a doubt will be. Who else likes a limo?"</P>
<P>"A private limo! It, it is pretty...cuddlesome." Willow said, scooting closer to Buffy. "And if we all split the cost..."</P>
<p>"Then it’s settled. We’ll all meet at my house on Thursday. That gives everybody two days. And Xander, since I don’t trust you to pick out a respectable tux, you’re going with me to shop tomorrow." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Save me." Xander said pleadingly. They all just grinned at him.</P>
<p>"The band’s playing at the dance. We’re actually practicing for it, so we should be good." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Good, it should be fun then…oh, damn." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"What?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"I have to meet Faith so we actually slay as a team this time. And I’m late. I gotta run. Hey do you want to invite her to come with us?"</P>
<p>"The more the better." Oz said. Everyone nodded in agreement.</P>
<p>Buffy got up off the stool.</P>
<p>"Watch your back." Willow said.</P>
<p>"I will." Buffy kissed her cheek, and walked off.</P>
<p>Willow turned back to the group who was smiling at her.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"You two are so cute together it’s disgusting." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>Willow just took a sip of her soda, smiling.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy sprinted into the graveyard to find Faith sitting on a headstone, twirling a stake. Faith was hanging around a lot more, trying to get involved with the gang, and Buffy was glad. She welcomed her to just about everything the gang did, and Faith accepted.</P>
<p>At first, Buffy thought that she wasn’t the type to actually hang out with others, but she surprised her. Faith hopped off the headstone, and started walking over.</P>
<p>"Hey there’s the other half of the chosen two."</P>
<p>"Sorry I’m late, lost track of time. Did you start without me?"</P>
<p>"I waited like a good girl. It was the G-man’s orders."</P>
<p>"He got to you too, huh?"</P>
<p>"You could say that."</P>
<p>They started walking through the cemetery.</P>
<p>"Faith I was with the gang before, and we were wondering if you wanted to come to the Bronze with us for this dance the school’s having. We’re getting a limo."</P>
<p>"You want me to come with you guys?" Faith asked, disbelieving.</P>
<p>"Why wouldn’t we?"</P>
<p>"I dunno, I just thought…"</P>
<p>"Look, I don’t know what you think of me, but anybody who saves my life is instantly on my friends list."</P>
<p>Faith had a guilty look on her face.</P>
<p>"All I’ve done since I’ve gotten here is given you a hard time."</P>
<p>"That wasn’t all you. You wanted to know about me, and I shut you out. I’m sorry. So are you in?"</P>
<p>"I’ll try. Thanks."</P>
<p>"Well, it’s better than no."</P>
<p>Off in the distance, they heard growling. They ran towards the noise, stakes at ready.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, Faith was lying down on the bed in her apartment. Her patrol with Buffy had left her thinking. When she showed up in Sunnydale, she had tried to get on Buffy’s nerves, upstage her, and basically be a pain in the ass. And she was doing a pretty good job she thought, and she wasn’t even trying that hard.</P>
<p>Yet, Buffy had looked past that, and had tried to befriend her tonight. Before she met her boss, anyone who spent five minutes with her wanted to get away as soon as possible, but Buffy kept at it. A part of her actually felt touched, and if it had been a different time she might’ve accepted her offer, but not now.</P>
<p>She had all the friends she needed and plenty of things at her disposal. Plus, she had a job to do, and she was pretty damn sure that if Buffy knew the real reason she was in this town was to kill her, that she wouldn’t be trying to extend any type of friendship toward her at all.</P>
<p>Her phone rang.</P>
<p>"Yeah? …Hey boss…No just bored…So what’s up this time? …I’m not surprised, he always did have creativity…No course I want in…Yeah I’ll be there…Oh really? …He wants to meet you too…Thanks, I really need to work off this energy…I’ll call you when it’s over…You always know how to cheer me up, boss…later."</P>
<p>Faith went to sleep with a smile on her face. She could become part of Buffy’s little band, but torturing her, and inevitably killing her, just seemed more satisfying somehow.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>At Trick’s house, a very well furnished house at that, a group of people was assembled. A man in wheelchair was wearing a headset and observing a series of monitors. At the table, three humans, two vampires dressed in ‘old west’ attire, and a yellow, spiked-demon were listening to Trick speak.</P>
<p>"Competition. Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive. It ...makes us accomplish. Occasionally, it makes us kill. We all have the desire to win." </P>
<P>He walked across the room, gesturing to the different species. </P>
<P>"Whether we're human...vampire...and whatever the hell you are, my brother. You got them spiny-looking head things. I ain't never seen that before."</P>
<P>"I am Kulak, of the Miquot Clan." The yellow creature said.</P>
<P>"Isn't that nice. Point is, you're all here for the same reason."</P>
<P>"Well, it sure ain't no philosophy class, now, is it?" Said the vampire wearing the cowboy hat, looking at his wife.</P>
<P>"Mr. Gorch, my account statement says that your deposit has not yet been made."</P>
<P>"Well, me and Candy... we’re blowin’ our whole honeymoon stash on this little game here."</P>
<P>He emptied a bloody bag of cash onto the table.</P>
<P>"They’re dirty."</P>
<P>"They're nonconsecutive."</P>
<p>Trick smiled.</P>
<P>"The games will begin in a few days time. The target, Buffy, is the main course my friends. The rest are just the side dishes. You can do whatever you like with them, but it has to be Miss Summers’ dead body on my doorstep for anybody to win this game. </P>
<P>"However, Buffy and her friends will all be together and ready for the killing, and that is a money-back guarantee."</P>
<p>He looked at everyone.</P>
<P>"Ladies, gentlemen, spiny-headed looking creatures, welcome to SlayerFest '98!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Willow had just come back from the mall where they had bought several dresses. They were in Willow’s room trying them on. Willow had a ‘changing barrier’ set up, so she was standing behind it and her shadow was the only thing visible on the other side.</P>
<p>"Why’d we get all these dresses anyway? We’re not going to keep all of them." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Because it was necessary."</P>
<p>"And why’s that?"</P>
<p>"Look, Will. I may not shop that much anymore, but I do know that if you can’t decide on a dress, you buy all the ones you’re interested in, try them out at home, and pick the one you like best. Then the next day, you return the others. Thank God for receipts."</P>
<p>"This is crazy. You already picked the one you’re gonna wear, and I’ve been doing this for an hour."</P>
<p>"It doesn’t matter which one you pick. You look great in all of them."</P>
<p>"You’re just saying that."</P>
<p>"I am not! Which one are you trying on now?"</P>
<p>"The black one. Oh, damn."</P>
<p>"What is it?"</P>
<p>"I think the zipper’s stuck."</P>
<p>"Hang on, Buffy to the rescue."</P>
<p>She walked behind the barrier, and behind Willow. The dress was up over her waist, and the middle of her back was bare up to the base of her neck. Buffy just looked at Willow, and drew in a breath. She was mesmerized.</P>
<p><I>‘It’s just her back.’  </I>Buffy told herself.</P>
<p>But it didn’t seem to matter at that moment. This was the first time she had seen Willow’s bare skin since they had revealed their feelings about one another. Even when Willow was living with her, she hadn’t ever seen her less than decent. They had always changed separately.</P>
<p>It was stirring reactions in her. Reactions she hadn’t felt toward anyone. Not since her night with Angel.</P>
<p><I>‘Her skin is so perfect.’</P>
<p></I>"Buffy? Are you okay?"</P>
<p>Buffy snapped out of it.</P>
<p>"Yeah, I’m fine."</P>
<p>She reached for the zipper, and started to pull it up slowly. She touched Willow’s back with her hand. She saw and felt Willow shiver. She ran her finger up Willow’s spine. Willow wasn’t stopping her, so she started kissing her skin. Up and down her back. She couldn’t get enough.</P>
<p>A small sound escaped Willow’s lips. Somewhere between a sigh and a whisper.</P>
<p>"Buffy…what…"</P>
<p>"You’re so beautiful." Buffy said, her soft kisses nearing Willow’s neck.</P>
<p>"Wait…"</P>
<p>"Did you want me to stop?" Buffy asked, letting up.</P>
<p>"No…" </P>
<p>Buffy resumed her kissing.</P>
<p>"But we have to…"</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<P>"We’re not ready…"</P>
<P>"We’re not?"</P>
<P>"Okay we are, but we still…have to…stop."</P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P>"It’s not time…"</P>
<P>"Give me a better reason."</P>
<P>"Parents…downstairs…bad visual…"</P>
<P>"Okay. That did it."</P>
<P>Buffy stopped, and the loss of contact caused Willow to release a small moan of protest. Buffy zipped up the dress, and turned Willow around, looking her up and down.</P>
<P>"We’re keeping this dress." Buffy said, trying to get her breathing back to normal.</P>
<P>"Definitely." Willow agreed.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In Trick’s house all the participants in the game, were training. He walked over to the man in the wheelchair that was looking at the monitors.</P>
<P>"Tonight, Mr. Trick, you will see why technology is the future, and unlike senseless killing, it is more efficient."</P>
<P>"That’s just great. Everything’s in place. Are your boys ready?"</P>
<P>"Do they look ready?" </P>
<P>Trick looked at the two German humans, the Gruenstahler brothers. They were practicing a blocking each other’s punches. The other human, more rugged than the clean cut Germans, was cleaning out his rifle. Kulak was facing a wall, and then out of his arms, came two long razor-like weapons, which he threw into the wall. Lyle Gorch and his wife were lying on the couch.</P>
<p>"Everyone’s ready." </P>
<P>As he started to walk to the other room, Faith came in, a briefcase in her hand.</P>
<p>"Well, well, well. Hello my dear." Trick said.</P>
<p>The Gorches sprang up.</P>
<p>"Take it easy cowboy, this little lady’s special."</P>
<p>"I didn’t realize you thought so highly of me."</P>
<p>"I give praise where it’s due. I’m glad you decided to grace us with your presence, but I got the feeling at our last meeting that I wouldn’t see you again."</P>
<p>"Well, things change. You see…" She walked over to the Germans, and ran her hands over their bare chests. "The boss heard about your Fest thing, and he wants in. Or, more accurately, I want in."</P>
<p>"As much as I like you, I’ll need a down payment. Nothing’s for free."</P>
<p>Faith sat the briefcase on the table, and opened it. Several hundred thousand dollars were inside.</P>
<p>"Good enough?" Faith asked.</P>
<p>"Plenty. Who is this boss of yours?"</P>
<p>"You’ll find out soon enough."</P>
<p>"I very much hope you win."</P>
<p>"I’m not going for the win. Yet."</P>
<p>"Only you would use the prize intelligently."</P>
<p>"Oh, if I won I wouldn’t want the cash. Just give me one of these German boys."</P>
<p>Faith grinned at Trick, and started to walk out.</P>
<p>"I’ll see you around."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>It was night and Buffy and Willow walked up to the sidewalk in front of Cordelia’s house. Willow had on the black dress, and Buffy had on a long red one. Coming down the walkway was Xander in a tux, arm in arm with Cordelia in a green dress.</P>
<p>Buffy and Willow went wide-eyed when they saw Xander up close.</P>
<p>"Wow…Xander, is that…" Buffy started.</P>
<p>"Really you?" Willow finished.</P>
<p>Xander twirled around, showing off the whole ensemble.</P>
<p>"Sometimes I can work miracles." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>Xander looked at Willow and Buffy.</P>
<p>"You guys okay? You look a tad…flushed."</P>
<p>"Of course we’re fine…why wouldn’t we…be…fine." They both said, stuttering.</P>
<p>They glanced around nervously, and saw the limo coming up the street.</P>
<p>"Look! It’s here." Willow said.</P>
<p>The limousine pulled up, and stopped. The driver got out, opened the back door, and they all piled in. A few minutes later they were off.</P>
<p>"Guess Faith didn’t wanna come?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"I called her before I left. She said if she was going, she’d meet us there, so I don’t know." Buffy said. </P>
<p>Cordelia looked at the floor. There were three corsages in small boxes.</P>
<p>"Look, free corsages." She handed one to Buffy and one to Willow. "I’m taking the orchid."</P>
<p>Buffy and Willow shrugged.</P>
<p>"It goes with my complexion better."</P>
<p>"Okay!" Buffy and Willow said, putting theirs on their wrists.</P>
<p>Cordelia looked at Xander.</P>
<p>"What’d I say?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The limo stopped in the woods. The driver’s side door opened and one of the German brothers ran out. Inside, they were all trying to see out the window.</P>
<p>"Finally we’re here." Buffy said, taking the initiative and getting out.</P>
<p>They all got out and realized they were in the middle of the woods.</P>
<p>"Okay, where’s the Bronze?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"I’m gonna take a wild guess, and say, not here." Xander said.</P>
<p>Buffy was looking around, and saw a VCR and a TV sitting on a tree stump, with a sign saying ‘PRESS PLAY’.</P>
<p>"What's massively wrong with this picture?" She asked.</P>
<p>Everyone walked over with her to the TV, and she pressed play on the VCR. Trick appeared on the screen.</P>
<p>"Hello, kids. Welcome to SlayerFest '98."</P>
<P>They stared at the monitor in disbelief.</P>
<P>"What is a SlayerFest, you ask? Well, as in most of life, there are the hunters and the hunted. Can you guess whe     re you fall? From the beginning of this tape, you have exactly thirty seconds…no, that's seventeen now…to run for your lives."</P>
<p>"Buffy," He said laughing slightly, "and slayerettes, have a nice death."</P>
<p>The TV went black.</P>
<p>"Hello! I’m not a slayerette!" Cordelia yelled.</P>
<p>"Yeah! The PC term is Slaying Assistant!" Xander yelled.</P>
<p>"No, Xander! I meant that I’m not a slayerette, I’m a Homecoming queen. I spent so much time campaigning…"</P>
<p>Xander wrapped his arms around her.</P>
<p>"Oh, will you knock it off." Willow said. She walked over to Buffy. "What do we do?"</P>
<p>"Start running."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy had been leading the way. Willow was behind her, followed by Xander and Cordelia who were walking side by side. They heard a rustling, and all stopped. They looked around for the source of the noise. Seeing nothing, Buffy started to take a step forward.</P>
<p>"Look out!" Willow yelled, looking at the bear trap directly in front of Buffy. With fast reflexes, Buffy lifted her foot back up, and the trap snapped shut. Knowing someone must be near for certain now, Buffy dropped to the ground, and everyone else followed suit. The human with the rifle was aiming at them. </P>
<p>He shot and missed. Buffy grabbed the sprung trap and hurled it at him. It hit him hard, and he staggered back into another bear trap. It snapped shut on his leg and he grunted in pain. Buffy hurried over to him, picking up his rifle along the way. She pointed it at him. </P>
<p>"That's gotta smart." Xander said.</P>
<P>The man tried to pry open the trap.</P>
<P>"Now, I can let you out of that, or I can put a bullet in your head. How many are there in this little game, and what are they packing?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>When he wasn’t speaking, Buffy pumped a fresh round into the gun’s chamber. He looked at it, and his eyes went wide.</P>
<P>"There's me, two Germans with AR-15s and grenade launcher...yellow-skinned demon with long knives... Vampire couple from Texas named Gorch."</P>
<P>"That everybody?"</P>
<P>"Everybody who's out here. Germans are wired. Their boss is tracking them on computer. Now get me out of this!"</P>
<p>Just as she reached down to do that, Cordelia screamed. Kulak’s weapons sliced into the tree in front of her. They all ran.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the Bronze, Giles was trying to find the gang. They were supposed to be there nearly twenty-five minutes ago. He couldn’t find them, so he made his way through the crowds of kids, and went outside. He decided to go back to the library in case they called.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back in the woods, the two brothers had their weapons poised, and they were dressed in black, wearing headsets. Their boss, the man in the wheelchair, was speaking to them.</P>
<p>"Continue proceeding south ninety meters to vector three."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They had come across an old cabin. As soon as they were all inside, Buffy shut the door. She got a chair to barricade it.</P>
<p>"We should be safe in here for awhile. We need to get more weapons." She said.</P>
<p>They all started to look around. Cordelia shouted that she found something. They came over.</P>
<p>"It’s a spatula." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"That’s it?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Oh, and just this phone."</P>
<p>They stared at her.</P>
<p>"And you didn’t think that would be helpful?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"No, cause this is better for…" Cordelia started to swat the air with the spatula. "Oh."</P>
<p>Buffy picked up the phone, and started to dial.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back in the library, Giles was drinking a cup of tea. As he walked over to his answering machine, he saw there was one message on it. He pressed a button.</P>
<p>"Giles, it's me...and everyone. We're in a cabin in Miller's Woods, and we're in big trouble." Buffy’s message got cut off.</P>
<P>Giles turned around, and came face to face with Lyle Gorch’s fist. Giles dropped to the ground. Candy walked up beside Lyle.</P>
<p>"When's she comin’?" Candy asked.</P>
<P>"Well, he's her Watcher. She'll show...just as soon as she gets rid of some of our competition."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Back at the cabin, Buffy looked at the phone and put it back on its cradle. </P>
<P>"It went dead."</P>
<P>Suddenly Kulak came crashing through a window. He immediately grabbed Buffy and threw her down onto an old mattress and pillow on the floor, which made her drop the rifle. She rolled out of the way as he swung at her with his blades, and they just sliced into the pillow. </P>
<P>Buffy rushed to the far wall and took down a set of antlers to use for defense. Kulak swung his blades at her. Buffy blocked the blades with the antlers and shoved the antlers aside. Kulak went down with them.</P>
<p>Xander pulled him up, and started to punch his face.</P>
<P>"The gun!" Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>Willow ran to get the gun, just as Kulak knocked Xander down. He went over to Buffy, and took a wide swing at her, cutting her arm, and making her fall. Willow found the rifle on the floor and picked it up. Kulak tried to swing again, but Buffy grabbed the end of the rug he was standing on and yanked it out from under him, making him fall backward and hit the floor hard on his back. </P>
<P>Willow raised the gun, and tried to look for a good spot to shoot. Kulak got back to his feet, and she shot and hit him in the leg. He dropped again. </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Outside the cabin the Gruenstahlers were setting up the grenade launcher.</P>
<p>"Prepare to launch." Their boss said through the headsets.</P>
<p>One of the brothers loaded a grenade into the launcher and closed the chamber. </P>
<P>"Target's in range. Y-axis fifty-three degrees west by eight degrees south."</P>
<p>He punched the coordinates into the targeting computer.</P>
<p>"Launch!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Inside, the grenade penetrated a window shutter and fell to the floor in front of Kulak. He looked at everyone. Buffy wrapped her arms around her friends, and they ran toward a window. Kulak went towards the window on the opposite side. </P>
<P>The gang jumped and crashed through their window. Kulak tried to jump through his also, but his window was shuttered behind the curtain, and he just bounced off of it. He took a quick, terrified breath, as the grenade exploded.</P>
<p>As they were running away outside, they momentarily lost track of one another in the blinding heat and light of the explosion as they fell to the ground away from the building. Out of nowhere, a figure clad in all black entire attire, even the face, ran in and grabbed Willow. The figure ran off, Willow in tow.</P>
<p>"Is everyone okay?" Buffy asked, getting up.</P>
<p>She looked at them. They seemed fine, but Willow. Where was she?</P>
<p>"Willow!" she yelled.</P>
<p>They all started looking around.</P>
<p>"Look, you guys get to the library. Get Giles. I’m going to find Willow."</P>
<p>"What if she –" Cordelia started.</P>
<p>They heard Willow scream.</P>
<p>"Go!" </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Inside Trick’s house he and the Gruenstahler’s boss were tracking Buffy, Cordelia, Willow on computer.</P>
<P>"One is heading west, back into town. Two others are going east, deeper into the woods."</P>
<P>"Only one person could have split up their group." There was a knock at the door.</P>
<P>"I’ll take care of it."</P>
<P>He went to answer the door. Two police officers were waiting outside.</P>
<P>"Evening, gentlemen. How may I help you?"</P>
<P>Without a word the two officers grabbed him and dragged him out of the house.</P>
<P>"Excuse me! Anybody got a warrant here?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back in the woods, the person in black was holding Willow by the neck, giving her just enough air to stay conscious.</P>
<p>"Be quiet, or I’ll choke the life right out of you."</P>
<p>"Faith?" Willow gasped.</P>
<p>"That’s right, Red. Now shut up."</P>
<p>Buffy came running up.</P>
<p>"Let her go."</P>
<p>Faith whispered to Willow.</P>
<p>"I’m gonna let you go, but if you squeal to anyone, I promise you, next time you’ll be dead."</P>
<p>With one final squeeze, Faith threw Willow to Buffy, and ran off.</P>
<p>"Are you okay?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded coughing.</P>
<p>"Who was that?"</P>
<p>"I…don’t know."</P>
<p>"Well, it doesn’t matter right now. We need to get to the library."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Xander and Cordelia were walking the halls in the school, making their way to the library.</P>
<p>"So let’s recap. Jungle Bob and spike-head are history. We've lost the grenade-happy Germans twice, and yet they find us. If we take them out and the vamps, we can still make the Bronze." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Those animals! Hunting us down like poor defenseless... well, animals." Said Cordelia, still holding the spatula.</P>
<P>They got to the library, and Candy roared and grabbed Xander by the arm. She swung him around and let go, but Xander maintained his balance. Candy tried to do a roundhouse kick to his face, but somehow, he managed to back away before it connected. </P>
<P>She grabbed him by the back of the neck and shoved him into a bookcase, causing several books to hit him as he fell to the floor. Dazed, he grabbed her leg, and made her fall too. Cordelia got his attention. </P>
<p>"Xander!" She yelled, as she tossed him the spatula.</P>
<p>He caught it, and turned to face Candy. She grabbed the coat rack as she got up. Xander lunged at her with the wooden end of the spatula and impaled it on her. Candy shoved the base of the coat rack into his face and made him stumble back into the walls. He fell over a wastebasket and into a potted tree before he fell to the floor unconscious. </P>
<P>Candy dropped the coat rack and noticed the spatula sticking out of her chest. Lyle looked terrified. She turned to ashes right before his eyes.</P>
<P>"Candy!"</P>
<P>He started for Xander on the floor. Cordelia calmly stepped over and headed him off.</P>
<P>"I'm gonna kill both of you for this! You hear me?"</P>
<P>"I hear you, you redneck moron. You got a dress that goes with that hat?"</P>
<P>"I'm gonna..."</P>
<P>"Rip out my innards, play with my eyeballs, boil my brain and eat it for brunch? Listen up, needle-brain. We’ve already taken out four of your cronies, not to mention your girlfriend."</P>
<P>"Wife!"</P>
<P>"Whatever. The point is, we’re not even Slayers and we still won. I haven't even broken a sweat. See everyone else is just the runners-up. I’m the Queen. You get me mad, what do you think I’m gonna do to you?"</P>
<P>Lyle was taken aback by that. Cordelia raised her eyebrows at him impatiently. He gave her a quick nod.</P>
<P>"Later."</P>
<P>He walked off, leaving a smiling Cordelia. Giles and Xander were coming to.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the Mayor’s Office in City Hall, a police officer shoved Trick inside. Mayor Richard Wilkins III smiled up at him.</P>
<P>"Hello! Nice to meet you."</P>
<P>"Yeah, hi, it's a pleasure. Where am I?"</P>
<P>"In my office. I'm Richard Wilkins. I'm the Mayor of Sunnydale. And you're...Mr. Trick. Please, sit down."</P>
<P>Trick took the seat offered, and realized something. </P>
<P>"You’re the boss aren’t you?"</P>
<P>"Guilty as charged. Faith’s a good girl. Like a daughter, but she’s not the issue in this meeting." The Mayor inspected Trick closer. "That's an exciting suit."</P>
<P>"Well, clothes make the man."</P>
<P>"Well, as I understand it, you're not a man... exactly. Mr. Trick, I've been the Mayor for quite some time. I like things to run smoothly. This is a very important year for me."</P>
<P>"Election year."</P>
<P>"Something like that."</P>
<P>"If this is the part where you tell me that I don't fit in here in your quiet little neighborhood, you can just skip it 'cause, see, that all got old long before I became a vampire. Do you know what I'm saying?"</P>
<P>"Do you have children? Children are the heart of a community. They need to be looked after. Controlled. The more rebellious element needs to be dealt with. The children are our future. We need them. I need them."</P>
<P>"If this rebellious element means who I think it does, then that problem may be taken care of this very night."</P>
<P>"So I've heard." He chuckled. "That's a very enterprising idea you have - SlayerFest. I love that name, by the way. You see, that's the kind of initiative I need on my team."</P>
<P>"What if I don't wanna be a part of the team?"</P>
<P>"Oh, no, that won't be an issue."</P>
<P>The Mayor reached onto his desk for a thin plastic box and opened the lid.</P>
<P>"See, you and I are gonna get along very well. Moist towelette?"</P>

<P>Back in the library both Xander and Giles were nursing their heads with ice packs, as Willow and Buffy walked in. Buffy looked at them.</P>
<P>"What happened to you guys?"</P>
<P>"Cordy just kicked some vampire ass while Giles and I were unconscious, that’s all." Xander said.</P>
<P>"Yes, I must admit that she did an admirable job. I feel that I should apologize. After all, I was the one who reserved the limousine for all of you." Giles said.</P>
<P>"That’s okay. At least we got these free corsages."  Cordelia said.</P>
<P>"Oh, that's nice. Although I don't recall them mentioning corsages."</P>
<P>"Jungle Bob... said that the Germans were hooked into a computer system." Buffy said looking closer at her corsage, which revealed a small transmitter. "And they're hooked into us."</P>
<P>They all looked up when they heard a door slam out in the halls. Cordelia quickly pulled her corsage off and threw it to the ground, smashing it with her foot.</P>
<p>"Willow give me yours." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Willow handed hers over to Buffy, giving her a questioning look.</P>
<P>"I need some wet toilet paper."</P>
<P>"Yeah! That'll help." Cordelia said sarcastically.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Out in the halls, the Germans pulled on their night vision goggles and were scanning and advancing through the darkness. Their boss talked over their headsets.</P>
<P>"Transmitting coordinates now. They're fifty feet away."</P>
<P>Suddenly Buffy ran across the hall. They tried to trace her and fire, but they weren’t fast enough to aim. One of them signaled the other to advance. Around the corner, Buffy ducked into a classroom. The one followed her in. The other listened to the instructions and took aim through a wall.</P>
<P>"Axis six degrees by forty-three. I have them both in range."</P>
<P>Inside the classroom, the German scanned around the dark room, but couldn’t see anything. The one in hall moved his rifle according to his instructions.</P>
<P>"I have the targets together, twenty feet north and stationary. Final position is locked. Fire when ready."</P>
<P>Still inside the classroom, he kept scanning, walking through the room. </P>
<P>"Both targets seven degrees by thirty-five."</P>
<P>Buffy rose up from behind a low bookcase. She threw a wad of wet toilet paper with the transmitters, and it hit the assassin on his back. He spun around to look at what direction he was hit from.</P>
<P>"Adjust! Right ten degrees! Fire!"</P>
<P>The one out in the hall started to shoot through the wall. The other one turned toward the fire and shot back. They kept shooting at each other through the wall until they hit each other and died.</P>
<P>"I won!" The boss said, back at the house.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the Bronze, they saw Faith, in a dress, looking at them. Bruised and battered, they all walked up to her.</P>
<P>"Jesus! What the hell happened?" She asked.</P>
<P>"Long story." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Got hunted." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>"Apparently not that long."</P>
<P>Faith looked at Willow, and saw she was nervous.</P>
<P>"Hey Willow, you okay? You look tense."</P>
<P>"Nope…I’m fine."</P>
<P>Faith smiled evilly at her.</P>
<P>Up on stage, Devon, the lead singer of the Dingoes stepped up to the microphone.</P>
<P>"Hey guys, the moment we've all been waiting for."</P>
<P>"Well, at least I’ll make queen. Something good will come from this night after all." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>"And the winner is...Hey, I believe we have a first for Sunnydale High. We have a tie."</P>
<P>Cordelia had a confused look on her face.</P>
<P>"The winners are Holly Charleston and Michelle Blake!"</P>
<P>Cordelia was shocked.</P>
<p>"So, who wants to go home?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Me." Willow and Xander both said.</P>
<p>Faith walked up to Willow.</P>
<p>"See you around, Red. Be good." She whispered.</P>
<p>Buffy and Xander started to walk away, and Willow, shaking, followed after them.</P>
<p>"Hey! What about my pain? I need comforting!" Cordelia called after them.</P>
<p>No one seemed to hear her, so she stormed out after them.</P>
