<p>In the town of Morning Breeze, in the common room of the inn, chaos
governed.
Some people were doing their best to leave, while others were out shouting
each other in a futile attempt to bring the room to some semblance of
order.   Standing at one end of the room, outwardly unperturbed, was
the arch-mage, Willow Rosenberg.  Inwardly, however, she was far from
serene.  Her worst nightmare was about to descend on the town, and she
was the person who was going to have to deal with the problem.</p>

<p>Deciding that panic had had enough of a head start, she climbed onto
a table and shouted in a booming voice, "enough!  Everybody, settle down,
and get back to your seats.  And get back now!"</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous, one of their leaders had spoken, and everyone
slowly returned to their seats.  Willow waited until the majority had
been seated, and until the noise level had abated to a tolerable level
before saying, "ok!  This has put a wrinkle into the plans, but it's
not fatal."</p>

<p>Willow allowed that statement to settle in before she turned to Padrick
and said, "Padrick, where are they, and how long until they get here?"</p>

<p>"They have just started to cross the southern pass, my Lady," said the
tired guardsman, "they'll be here in force in about three hours, scouting
parties about an hour before that."</p>

<p>"How many," asked Willow.</p>

<p>"Nearly a thousand."</p>

<p>"That adds another wrinkle," said Buffy as she began to pace; turning
to her spouse she added, "and a big one; now, how do we handle this?"</p>

<p>"By not panicking," replied the arch-mage, climbing down from the table
and sitting down once again in her chair.  "First, we move up the ritual
for closing the hell-mouths."</p>

<p>"Is that possible," asked Aiofe, "you have just told us that you were
going to do the closing at dusk."</p>

<p>"That was only to allow time for everyone to get ready," said Willow,
"the ritual can be done at any time."</p>

<p>"Ok, so we can get moving on that," said Buffy, "how much time do you
need?" </p>

<p>"About an hour," replied Willow, "we'll have the participants do the
ritual bathing altogether, and after that spend some time in meditation."</p>

<p>"That takes care of the mages, now how do we keep the ritual undisturbed?"</p>

<p>"That is where you, the other slayers, and Daithi and his merry men come
into play.  You are going to have to keep the demons away long enough
for the ritual to be completed, hopefully no more than two or three hours
after I begin; once it is done, they should be all unconscious."</p>

<p>"Not too good lover," said Buffy worriedly, "fifty to one odds.  Those
are high, even by my standards, not to mention keeping them away from
you for nearly two hours."</p>

<p>"I know," said Willow, "but you only have to hold them off, not defeat
them utterly."</p>

<p>"Besides," said Amana, "you will have Grael and me helping you."</p>

<p>"Huh," said Willow, "but I'm going to need your help."</p>

<p>"Buffy will need us more," replied Grael, "you are strong enough to lead
the ritual; Amana and I will not add significantly to it."</p>

<p>"You will be a help," said Buffy, "but what about restrictions on using
your, and, come to think of it, my, magic?"</p>

<p>"No problem," said Willow, having quickly worked through in her own mind
the pros and cons of not having Amana and Grael helping her during the
ritual, "everyone else in the area will either be part of the ritual,
or in the room with us for protection.  The three of you will have a
free hand, since anything left moving around outside of the village will
be demon in origin."</p>

<p>"Another problem may have just come up," said Daithi, who had entered
the inn, just as Willow had restored order, from his morning inspection
of the defensive positions that had been set up during the previous week.
He sat down and began to consume a quick meal, knowing that he would,
in all likelihood, not be eating again until the upcoming battle with
the demons had been resolved, one way or the other.</p>

<p>"Huh," asked a now confused Willow, "what did we forget?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Daithi, "at least in a preparation for the ritual
sense.  But, it looks like a major weather system is pushing in quickly
from the north.  We should be getting snow, and lots of it within the
next few hours." </p>

<p>Turning to everyone in the room, Willow then said, "ok folks, this isn't
good news, by any stretch of the imagination, but panic isn't going to
help.  We have the plan that we've been working on all week, and we have
the ability to strike a devastating blow against the demons occupying
this world; so let's stay focused, do what we've trained for and give
the demon leadership a message that they'll never forget."</p>

<p>The people in the common room then exploded into purposeful action.
They began by organizing themselves into various groups; some to round
up the rest of the townspeople and bring them to safety, others to begin
their preparations for the ritual.  Buffy left the room and headed to
the training area, planning on using it as her base of operations.  Willow
picked up her daughters and headed for the baths, both Faith and Kendra
would be staying with her, for the duration of the day's events.</p>

<p>Bridie and Aiofe headed to the kitchens, to make sure that the cooks
were made aware of the new timetable.  The cooks had already been awake
for the last few hours, making the morning meal, and arranging for food
to be prepared and sent to the converted barn in which Willow would be
conducting the ritual.  Bridie and Aiofe also wanted to make certain
that the cooks remembered that all fires, torches and lamps in the inn
were to be extinguished before they joined the rest of the villagers
who would be taking shelter with Willow and the other mages conducting
the ritual.   Once they had completed their trip to the kitchens, the
two young women joined Willow, her daughters and the other mages in the
baths, to get ready for their roles in the upcoming task.</p>

<p>All through the village, everyone implemented the contingency plans,
which had been developed over the previous week.  Fires were extinguished;
the livestock was collected, some to be brought to the inn - the rest
to be sent into the hills. Weapons were collected and stored in the
converted
barn, to be used by the villagers who were taking shelter there in the
defence of their homes, should it come to pass that the demons were able
to get by Buffy and the other slayers. </p>

<p>One hour after receiving the news that the demons were about to attack,
everything was ready.  The town was silent, and dark.  Buffy and the
rest of the defenders had taken up their already prepared positions at
the southern edge of the town.  Willow and the rest of the villagers
had assembled in the converted barn, ready to begin the ritual, which
would hopefully close the hell-mouths forever, and give a severe blow
to the demons that were besieging this world. </p>

<p>Willow looked around the room, at the twenty-nine people who would be
assisting her in the ritual, and at the villagers who were taking refuge
with the mages in the old barn; these were primarily the elderly, the
infirm and the expectant.</p>

<p>"Ok folks," she said, standing at one end of the building and addressing
the non- participants, "we're nearly ready to begin.  I'm sorry that
I don't have the time to give you as detailed explanation about what
is going to happen as I usually do, but, don't worry, and whatever you
do, don't leave this room.</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask that you try to keep as quiet as you can, and to stay
well away from the circles.  I'm not too sure what may manifest during
the ritual, but whatever happens and whatever you see, please don't freak
on me.</p>

<p>"I'll be putting a protection ring around the building, to try to keep
the baddies away.  It won't stand up to a determined assault, but it
will give you a good deal of protection, and more importantly warning
that this building is about to be attacked."</p>

<p>With that, Willow returned to the centre of the room.  She stood in the
exact centre of three large circles, which had been inscribed directly
into the packed earth floor of the building, each one about two feet
inside of the other.  She took one last look around, to make certain
that everything was in place, and that she had access to the tools she
would need over the next few hours.  She saw the people who would be
participating in the ritual standing in a loose circle around her.  Some
of the participants, such as Frankel, Bridie and Aiofe, were relaxed
and confident, others were showing some small measure of nervousness.</p>

<p>Willow looked carefully at each person, spending the time to seek out
and look directly into his or her eyes.  She was trying, successfully,
to reassure each of them that what they were about to do was going to
be successful, and that they would survive.  She thought to herself,
"Goddess, give me the strength I need," and was not too surprised to
have a sense of peace descend over the room.  </p>

<p>Taking a deep breath she thought &lt;ok love, we're good to go.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;We'll keep the nosey neighbours from bothering you, luck.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Thanks, love you.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Love you too.   See you when it's all over.&gt;</p>

<p>Turning to the alter Willow then said, "ok everyone, places."</p>

<p>The other participants then began to finalize the preparations for the
ritual.  Some went to light the watchtowers, and the others moved to
take their places within the various circles.  Aiofe, Bridie, Faith,
Kendra, Frankel and the two other mages, which would be acting as joint
High Priest with Frankel, joined Willow in the centre of the circles.</p>

<p>Just as she was taking a breath, to begin the ritual, Willow noticed
that she had been joined by a familiar presence, she looked down and
said, "there you are, Shadow-Cat; glad you could make it."</p>

<p>Her familiar looked up, purring as she weaved between Willow's legs,
before she took up her accustomed place under the high-altar.</p>

<p>Willow and Frankel, with the assistance of the other High-Priests and
Priestesses, then began the breathing exercises and chants which would
centre the group and allow Willow to continue.  Once she was satisfied
that everyone had focused in on the task to be done, she, along with
the others, cast the three times three circles which would, she hoped,
protect everyone from the actions she was going to undertake.</p>

<p>As had happened previously the shields, and the guardians, manifested
themselves as actual physical objects in the room, visible to all.
As the now familiar physical guardians appeared Willow thought to herself,
"I hope that no-one freaks over this, since I forgot to mention it to
those who haven't seen it happen before." </p>

<p>Fortunately for Willow, none of the townspeople taking shelter in the
barn, nor any of the new mages panicked; they were all startled, but
were able to keep their composure.</p>

<p>As soon as she returned to the centre of the circles, Willow began to
draw up the power she would need for the rest of the ritual.  As she
started to collect the energy from the magical realm, channelled through
each of the participants in the circle, she realized that the amount
of energy she was collecting, focusing and storing was tremendous.</p>

<p>She thought to herself, "I could level the Rockies with this much power."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Ten kilometres to the south, the demon lord leading the impending attack
on the human village was in an upbeat mood.  He was in a large tent that
he had set up as his mobile command post, with his various subordinates
and sub-commanders in attendance with him as he prepared for the next
step in the mission that his lord had given him.  So far, things had
been progressing according to plan, and he figured that within the day
he would be sucking the marrow from the bones of the slayer.</p>

<p>"So far the opposition has been non-existent," he though to himself,
as he was reviewing his plans for the final assault on the village.
"Not much movement in the village, or in the outlying areas, however,
she must know we are coming." </p>

<p>Coming to a decision he barked out to a lieutenant, "call back the recon
force.  Now that the bulk of the army is in the valley proper, we don't
need them scouting ahead anymore."</p>

<p>"Your will, lord," replied the yellow skinned demon, turning to leave.</p>

<p>"Are you certain about calling them back, my lord," asked another lieutenant
carefully, this one a mottled blue demon with gold horns, "we still do
not know precisely where they are located."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter Tarana," said the lord, beginning to pace in the confined
quarters of the tent, "they have to be in that village, or in the
surrounding
area, somewhere.  If we level the place and search the rubble, we are
certain to find our target."</p>

<p>Not being able to voice any further concerns, and be able to keep her
head, the demon turned back to reviewing the part of the attack plan
that she would be required to implement.  It was, all in all, a rather
simple plan, she would be required to move her third of the army to the
west, and then sweep into the village as part of a three-pronged attack.
The more she looked over the plan, the more concerned she became.  It
was looking like her lord was trusting in an all-out attack to overwhelm
the village, and that sheer numbers would be enough to defeat whatever
defences were in place.  She decided that, to be on the safe side, she
would hold back a portion of her forces; just to see how the battle
developed,
"after all," she reasoned to herself, "if they are not needed they can
help with the mopping up, and, if we do have resistance, I'll be able
to use them to shore up any weak points in our assault."</p>

<p>The demon lord stopped his pacing, turned to his staff, and said, "that's
it.  Let's get to it.  And remember, there is absolutely no room for
failure." </p>

<p>The various officers and aids left the tent, to return to their own
commands.
They were confident that their numbers alone would be enough to crush
any humans that they came across.  Even the most pessimistic amongst
them figured that it would take no more than a day or so to eliminate
the humans and be back on the road home.</p>

<p>Just as he was leaving his tent, the demon lord felt a stirring in the
magical energies.  Curious, he translated his sight into the magical
realm and saw the effect that Willow was having there; it looked like
a black hole, centred to the north, was sucking in all of the energy
in the area.  Just as he was returning his vision to the normal world,
he felt the effects of Willow's work, as an enormous magical backlash
struck him, giving him a headache of near migraine proportions.  </p>

<p>Staggering under the pain, he called out to his staff, "hold up for a
minute.  We've got a new set of problems.  Find our mages, now."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy shivered in the sub-zero temperatures and looked around at the
improvised bunker that she was sharing with Alya, Padrick and one of
the other new slayers.  It was an improvised barricade of stone and wood,
located just to the south and along the main road that bisected the village.
Thinking that if they had had just a little more time that they would
have been able to build a more substantial set of defences, she thought,
"it will have to do.  No use worrying about what ifs at this point."</p>

<p>She turned to Alya, noticed the young woman shivering and said, "cold
day isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's not really the cold."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Buffy gently, "just remember, you are a slayer.  You
are with your friends and companions, and that we have the favour of
the Goddess on our side."</p>

<p>"I know, but...."</p>

<p>"That doesn't help much, though does it?"</p>

<p>"No, and..."</p>

<p>"And what?"</p>

<p>"Well, last time I faced off against demons, I nearly died.  I would
have died if you hadn't been there to heal me."</p>

<p>"You can't forget that, I know.  But, you are going to have to put it
in the back of your mind.  If you don't, it will impair your performance,
and probably put you into danger."</p>

<p>"I know, but it's hard.  How do you manage?"</p>

<p>"Practice, plus in the beginning it was easier for me."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"In part because when I began, I was not surrounded by hundreds of vampires
and demons," Buffy paused for a moment, then continued, "that came later."</p>

<p>"Well, at least I'm with you, that is a comfort."</p>

<p>"And we have Shari and Padrick also.  They'll be able to help, of that
I'm sure." </p>

<p>"That we will, miss," said Padrick.  "We'll be ok."</p>

<p>Just as Padrick finished, speaking the four of them felt an electric
tingle wash over their bodies.  Realising, through her link with her
lover, what was happing Buffy turned to the others and said, "ok, let's
look sharp.  That was Willow beginning her spell.  It'll be up to us
to keep the baddies away." </p>

<p>Everyone gripped their weapons a bit tighter and began to scan the horizon
to the south, with just a little bit more care.  For they knew that the
demon army would be upon them soon.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Just to the west of Buffy's position, Amana and Grael were also setting
up their defensive position.  As was the case with the slayer's position,
theirs was a defensive position more in intent than in substance, and
both mages knew that it would not sustain a prolonged attack for very
long.  </p>

<p>They shared their position with Daithi and one of the new slayers, who,
like Alya, was very concerned about the upcoming battle.</p>

<p>Amana noticed the young woman, trembling and looking around furtively,
and said, "relax Maria, it'll be a while before anything happens."</p>

<p>"I know lady," whispered the young woman, who was barely out of her teens,
"I'm just having difficulty processing everything that's been happening."</p>

<p>"Just remember what we are trying to do, concentrate on what you have
to do, and remember that you are not alone," replied Amana, as she embraced
the younger woman.</p>

<p>"I know," repeated Maria, "its just that I've never done anything like
this before.  I've never experienced anything like what's happened to
me over the last few months."</p>

<p>"No one has," answered Amana, "all of us have been overwhelmed by recent
events."</p>

<p>"Except..." whispered Maria.</p>

<p>"Except, you think, Buffy and Willow," said the older woman, tightening
her hug, just a little more.</p>

<p>Maria moved away from Amana and sat on the ground.  She paused for a
moment, and then asked "what is it with those two?  Why are they unfazed
by anything?"</p>

<p>"It only appears that way," replied Amana, "but, truth be told, they
constantly worry about everything, and everyone."</p>

<p>"Doesn't look that way."</p>

<p>"That is just a sign of their growing maturity as partners, and leaders,"
added Grael, contributing to the discussion for the first time.</p>

<p>"Not to mention becoming parents," said Daithi, "that alone is enough
to 'mature' anyone quickly."</p>

<p>"But..." said Maria, "they are always so up on things."</p>

<p>"That has only happened recently," said Daithi, "when they first arrived..."
Daithi paused to recollect for a moment before continuing, "Goddess,
it's been exactly a year today since they arrived."</p>

<p>Just then, Daithi and the others felt an electric tingle across their
bodies, which raised the tiny hairs on their arms, even though they were
bundled in multiple layers of clothing against the cold.</p>

<p>"That must be Willow beginning," commented Amana.</p>

<p>"You're right," agreed Grael, "looks like she succeeded in the first
part of her work today."</p>

<p>"How's that," asked Maria.</p>

<p>"She managed to raise a mammoth amount of power, without destroying the
village."</p>

<p>"That's not all that is happing," said Daithi, looking to the northern
sky, "the storm is about to break... right over us."</p>

<p>"Quick," yelled Grael over the suddenly howling wind, "lets bundle up
together and ride out the storm."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The winter storm hit the valley with a vengeance.  The temperature and
the visibility plummeted, and the winds rose, till they were whipping
over the mountains, before plunging straight through the valley, numbing
everything in their path.  The wind chill rose till it was sucking every
hint of warmth from the bodies of both the defenders in the town, and
the demon army preparing to attack them.</p>

<p>It was if the Gods had decided to provide a violent and chaotic backdrop
to the titanic struggle, the opening act of which had just started.</p>

<p>Willow and the rest of the participants in the converted barn, never
noticed the rising storm.  Willow was struggling to maintain her focus,
and to control the enormous amount of energy she had raised.  The other
members of the circles were trying to contain the energy that Willow
was passing over to them, and to maintain the shields protecting the
circle.  Willow continued her internal struggle for over twenty minutes
before she felt ready to proceed with the next step in her plan.  </p>

<p>Turning to Bridie and Aiofe she panted, "that's that then.  I think that
I've got control of the energy that I'll need.  Now for the hard part."</p>

<p>"If that was the hard part, what's next," asked a very concerned Aiofe.
She, and her lover, had been aware of Willow's efforts, but knew that
they were in no position to help once Willow had begun her work, and
that the arch-mage would have to manage on her own.</p>

<p>"It's time for me to translate my sight, and as much of my essence as
I can, into the magical realm, and to look for a week point to hack into."</p>

<p>"I know," said Bridie, "but, what do you need us to do?"</p>

<p>"Keep control over the power we've raised; keep control over the shields
we have put up around the circle, and the barn, and, incidentally, keep
a second eye on me, so that I can find my way back, once this is over."</p>

<p>"Now I understand what she meant by the easy part being over," commented
Frankel dryly.</p>

<p>"Sarcasm is inappropriate in a sage," retorted Willow, "now, if we are
all ready, lets move on to stage two."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Down the valley the demon leadership were just concluding a hastily called
meeting with their mages when the storm broke over their encampment.</p>

<p>"That's all we need," said the demon lord, shivering as the wind began
to suck the warmth from his exposed skin.  "This development is going
to slow us down, even more than worrying about that cursed witch was
already going to do." </p>

<p>"But, my lord," replied one of his lieutenants, "this will also affect
the humans, won't it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but they are all nice and snug in their town, whereas we have to
move across the valley  against the wind, I might add."</p>

<p>The demon lord paced in front of his command tent for a moment before
continuing, "nothing we can do about it, if we are to believe the 'wisdom'
of our mages.  So, lets get the army moving."</p>

<p>The demon leader was reacting to the somewhat ambivalent information
his mages had given him, regarding the disruption Willow was causing
in the magical realm.  Their consensus, albeit very guarded, was that
the human mage was simply trying to cause a disruption in the magical
energy fields, and that it would not cause any great problems in the
battle, however, the mages had indicated that as a result of the human's
actions, their abilities to assist the army would be severely curtailed
if not eliminated totally.</p>

<p>The mages had also commented that there was something strange and powerful
happening in the vicinity of the village.  They were unable to clarify
what it was exactly, or determine if it was something that would cause
problems to the army. </p>

<p>The demon army proceeded up the valley towards the small village.  The
demons slogged through the snow, turning the fields into quagmires of
mud, slowing them down even more that the bitter wind in their faces
was.</p>

<p>Finally, more than two hours after they started their march, they were
in position on three sides of the town.  It was noon, not that anyone
could tell, since visibility was now no more than ten meters.  The army
was cold, wet and demoralized.  They were caked with mud, and their clothing
stuck to their bodies, damp with the melted snow, which had forced its
way under their armour.  The demons stamped their feet, from nervousness,
and as a way to try to keep warm, while they waited for the signal to
attack.</p>

<p>Suddenly the gloom of the snow-choked sky was lit by numerous magical
flares, as the townspeople attacked, in the defence of their homes, and
their lives. </p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The defenders of the village had huddled behind their fortifications
as the storm broke over the village.  It would be a storm remembered
for generations, that is, if anyone was left alive to remember it at
the end of the day.</p>

<p>Buffy stood staring to the south, oblivious to the weather, straining
to catch a glimpse at the army she knew was approaching.</p>

<p>Finally, after nearly two hours of standing, gazing through the diminishing
visibility, she turned to Padrick and said, "they're near.  Do you think
that you could get to Amana and have her come over here, I have a plan."</p>

<p>"I think so," replied the guardsman as he left their improvised
fortifications
and headed into the storm to where Amana was located.</p>

<p>"Plans.  Plans are good," said Alya, beginning to shiver just a little
more, but not from the cold.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," reassured Buffy as she finally took refuge from the storm
by sitting down behind the fortifications.  "This weather is certain
to have caused more problems for the baddies, than for us.  That will
work in our favour." </p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that," replied the young woman.</p>

<p>At that moment Padrick returned with Amana.  After settling in for a
moment the older woman turned to Buffy and asked, "Afternoon, Buffy,
what is it you think I can help you with?"</p>

<p>"They're close.  Very close now."</p>

<p>"Ok, now what do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"Wise man once say  best defence is a good offence.  So I think that
we should attack."</p>

<p>"Okay..." said Amana carefully, "how do you want to proceed?"</p>

<p>"We need light, and lots of it," said the slayer, "then we will see what
we are up against.  Once we know that, we blast them from here with
everything
we've got.  Then, hopefully, there won't be too many left to attack us
in the town." </p>

<p>"Worth a try," said Padrick, "beats waiting for them to attack us." </p>

<p>"Maybe the surprise factor, combined with what had to have been a
demoralizing
trek through this weather might cause some of them to panic and run away,"
said Amana.   She thought for a moment then added, "I should be able
to provide the light needed, Padrick, could you go back and let Grael
know what we are going to do, so that he's ready?"</p>

<p>"No problem lady," said the guardsman, once again heading out into the
weather. </p>

<p>"Ok," said Buffy, "that takes care of light.  Now, what can we blast
them with?" </p>

<p>"Well," said Amana, "you should be able to use your abilities to strike
from a distance, I would suggest that create some walls of air to crush
some of the demons.  Grael will be able to use some of his earth-based
skills to disrupt them, and cause them to worry about their footing.
I will be able to strike with water and some limited fire based spells."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," said Buffy.</p>

<p>"Lady," asked Alya, "what do you want Shari and I to do?  Neither of
us has any magical abilities."</p>

<p>"Your job will be to keep any bad guys away from Amana and me, while
we are concentrating on our magic."</p>

<p>"That we can do," replied Shari.</p>

<p>"Padrick should have reached, and briefed, Grael by now," said Amana,
"time to go to work."</p>

<p>Amana stood up and moved away from the improvised fortifications, in
the direction Buffy had indicated the bulk of the demons were located.
She stood, feet slightly apart, and braced herself against the wind.
She paused, and delved deep within her reserves, to tap the power at
her command.</p>

<p>Once she was ready she turned to Buffy, nodded, then turned back to face
her opponents, with her arms stretched out before her, and yelled out
over the roar of the wind, "ceau o leayrtys!"</p>

<p>Streaks of light sprung from her fingertips and shot into the snow-choked
sky.  Seconds later they exploded, turning the glow into near sunlit
skies, and illuminating the massive demon army, poised to attack the
village. </p>

<p>Buffy had watched, waiting, while Amana turned the lights on.  When she
saw the forces arraigned against the humans she thought to herself, "oh
boy, we could be in a world of pain here."</p>

<p>She didn't, however, allow any thoughts of the opposition arrayed in
front of her  deter her from what she had planned to do.  As soon as
the light exploded over the demons Buffy was ready.  She took a deep
breath, centred herself and yelled out, "bollaghey ni gaarder!"</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous.  Buffy had decided that her best attack
was to work with the storm and therefore the spell she had chosen had
the effect of strengthening and solidifying the winds facing the demons.
The wrinkle was that the wind became a wall, a wall that Buffy was able
to move as she willed.  </p>

<p>Facing this enhancement to the weather the demons struggled to stay upright,
and maintain their footing as the wall of wind came pushing down against
them, driving most of them to their knees, and forcing the remainder
to move back, away from their points of attack.</p>

<p>Grael attacked as soon as Buffy's wall of wind hit the demons.  He created
massive rifts in the earth, to swallow the enemy.  He then turned vast
areas of the ground into liquid earth, stopping, and in some cases drowning,
the demons trapped in the area that the spell to effect in.</p>

<p>Amana then counter-punched with bolt after bolt of lightning.  She took
careful aim at the demons and specifically targeted for attack anyone
who looked like they were trying to rally the army, figuring, correctly,
that they would be leaders. </p>

<p>The mages at the demon's disposal were totally ineffective against the
magical assault.  They repeatedly tried to deflect of lessen the effects
of the spells directed against their army, only to have their efforts
blocked or defeated totally.  Soon they were all exhausted and comatose,
drained from the effort of trying to match their skill against the power
of two experience mages, and the slayer. </p>

<p>The waves of attacks from the three mages continued relentlessly, and
now totally unopposed.  However, their foes were numerous, and the energy
that they had at their disposal was not limitless.  Soon the demons began
to make headway against the magic being arrayed against them, their leaders
were able to gain control over a substantial number of the survivors
and they began to move ever closer to the village, and to being able
to directly attack the humans who were inflicting so much pain on them.</p>

<p>Buffy saw that the demons would soon be upon them.  She turned to Amana
and yelled out, "Amana, I'm going to have to go into attack mode, and
soon.  Stay with Alya and Shari and try to keep the demons from flanking
us." </p>

<p>"Your will lady," replied Amana as she quickly returned to the
fortifications,
to begin to prepare for the upcoming hand-to-hand fight.</p>

<p>Buffy released her control of the wind and steadied herself.  She looked
deep within herself and said, "Goddess, hear my plea.  I beseech the
aid of your guardians in this our hour of need.  Come to my aid, give
strength to my arm, and guide me as I go forth to smite your enemies."</p>

<p>Buffy was deliberately asking to be transformed into the berserker, which
she had transformed into the first time that the Goddess had come to
her aid.  She knew that she would need the fearlessness, and the added
adrenaline that the berserk state would give to her for the coming battle.</p>

<p>Just as she was slipping into the mindlessness of the rage she noticed
four huge humanoid figures appear behind her, the manifestations of the
guardians.  She struggled to send one last thought to her lover, &lt;Willow.
I'm going into berserk mode, love you,&gt; and was devastated to not be
able to get a reply from her soul mate.</p>

<p>The last conscious thought she had before slipping into a rage was of
an incoherent scream of "Willow, where are you," leaving her throat.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Willow's awareness was not on this world.  With the exception of a very
small path of energy leading back to the ritual circle she had detached
herself from the reality of the world in order to hack into and destroy
the demon's transportation network.  While her body remained, lifeless,
in the centre of the three magical circles, her mind was totally in the
magical realm.  She therefore could not hear her lover's thoughts, nor
hear her strangled cry of loss.</p>

<p>She was in a place that had no reference to time, or space.  A place
that was  without definable borders.  She trusted, that as had happened
before, Aiofe and Bridie would be able to pull her back to reality, once
the job had been finished. </p>

<p>She did not know how long she had been divorced from reality, and had
been spending her time examining the various ties that were binding the
hell-mouths together.  Finally, she thought that she had found a way
to break into the network and to hopefully disrupt it for a very long
time.</p>

<p>With a quick prayer to herself, "Goddess, aid me now," she began to focus
her attention on the network.</p>

<p>Within moments she had broken into the energy path flowing from one hell-
mouth to another, thinking, "that was easy, now for the next step," she
then backtracked along the path she had left for herself and then expanded
it to begin the work of pumping the vast amount of energy she had raised
into the demon's network.</p>

<p>"Hope this doesn't take too long," she though as she began to funnel
the collected energy into the breach she had created in the demon's network,
" I don't think Buffy and the others can possibly hold out much longer."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Initially the demon leader was stunned by the ferocity of the attack
by the three mages.  He had known that the one mage he thought they were
facing was strong, but he had been totally unprepared for the effect
that these other mages were having on his troops.</p>

<p>Quickly regaining his composure he turned to his lieutenants and barked,
"get forward as quickly as you can, and get them back into line and let's
get this attack moving.  The longer we delay, the more damage they are
going to be able to do to us."</p>

<p>Inwardly he was seething.  He knew that this development was severely
impacting on the chances for success, and he knew that failure was not
an option.  He decided that he would have to move to the vanguard of
the attack, and lead his troops by example.  He resolved to himself that
as soon as he had defeated the puny humans sheltering in this sorry excuse
for a town that he would raze it to the ground, and then scatter its
ashes to the four corners of the earth. </p>

<p>He moved slowly forward through his demoralized army, trying to install
confidence in them as he struggled against the effects of the magic arrayed
against the demons.  </p>

<p>Finally, as he was approaching the front ranks of the army, the wind
died down. </p>

<p>Thinking, "finally, something is going our way," he looked towards the
village that was now the singular object of his anger and loathing.
What he saw there caused him to quickly change his mind about things
going his way. </p>

<p>"Good Gods of chaos," he said in a half throttled whisper, "what on all
of the earths is happening here?"</p>

<p>Four visions from legend had appeared before the army.  All four were
quasi- humanoid in stature, and stood in excess of four meters.  The
first had pale, almost translucent, yellow skin, and had the body of
a man, with the wings and head of an eagle.  The second appeared to have
flames for skin, and had the head and wings of a dragon on top of its
obviously female body.  The third, male in appearance, looked like it
had water flowing continuously over, and through, its skin, it stared
towards the demons with the predatory glare of its shark like head.
The fourth being, this one female, was the most 'normal' of the four.
She had a perfectly sculpted, albeit green, body, and what appeared to
be mottled green- brown leafs continuously falling from her head.</p>

<p>In front of the four figures of legend, and almost un-noticed, was a
fifth person.  This one, however, the demon lord knew.</p>

<p>"Gods, the slayer," he whispered.  He then noticed that several of the
humans who were fighting, and easily defeating, his forces appeared to
also be slayers. </p>

<p>"This is not good," he said, "the cursed slayer has recruited others."</p>

<p>Just then he watched as the slayer drew forth a sword from her body,
and with an incomprehensible scream leaped forward into the front of
the demon ranks, just as her sword burst into flame.</p>

<p>As if it was planned, the four guardians chose that moment to step forward
towards the demon army, and where they walked the ground trembled in
their wake.  They paused, just behind the ranks of slayers, as if waiting
for the most opportune time to intervene.  </p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy leaped into the demon army, all rational thought gone from her
mind as she was consumed by the berserker rage, and the thought that
she had lost her soul- mate.  She attacked relentlessly, without heed
for her personal welfare.  She began by cutting a wide swath through
the front ranks of the demon army, and then continued towards the western
edge of the town, towards the inn and where Willow was conducting the
ritual.  It was as if, even in her mindless state, Buffy wanted to be
where her lover was, if only to confirm her fate.  As had happened before,
Buffy was almost untouchable, nothing the demons tried seemed to stop,
or even for that matter slow her down.</p>

<p>The other slayers and the guardsmen wasted no time in launching their
own attacks, starting with ranged attacks.  There efforts were immediate,
as the leading elements of the demon army withered under the onslaught
of bolts and arrows.  But, for every foe that fell, there was two, or
more to replace them.  Slowly the demons were able to force their way
forward and reach the slayers; then it was down to hand-hand combat.</p>

<p>At that point, the guardians stepped forward once again. This time they
didn't pause and they then began to attack the demons directly.  They
had no weapons to hand but every demon withered and died under their
touch.  They slowly began to move to the east, away from Buffy; where
they went, the demon army collapsed in panic and fled the battlefield.</p>

<p>Over on the other side of the battlefield the fight was not going totally
against the demons.  They were faced with a berserk slayer, and two mages
who were doing their best to keep up with, and support her, but they
were better led and were fighting an organized retreat from the slayer.
They were trying their best to avoid direct one-to-one fighting with
Buffy, knowing that it would futile, and fatal.  They were therefore
concentrating on mass attacks, hoping that in numbers they would be able
to deal blows to the slayer.</p>

<p>The demon lieutenant Tarana saw that her quickly improvised strategy
was working.  Realizing early in the fight that the overly simplistic
plan of her lord was doomed to failure, she decided to leave the battle
with as many of her forces intact as possible.  Calling upon her reserves
she had had them cut a path through the dead and dieing.  She was therefore
able to maintain order as she moved towards the edge of town, and a chance
to escape.  She realized that her chance for success increased as long
as her forces kept moving, and as long as the manifestations of the
guardians
stayed away.</p>

<p>Amana, Grael, Padrick, Ayla and Shari were doing their best to keep up
with Buffy, and to try  to help the slayer in eliminating as many of
the demons as they could.  The guardsman and the two slayers were able
to keep up fairly well with Buffy, and were able to inflict a fair amount
of damage themselves, while trying to keep Buffy from being overwhelmed
by the mass attacks of demons which were throwing themselves at her in
an attempt to inflict more than superficial damage.  </p>

<p>However, both Amana and Grael were beginning to fall behind the others.
They had both been drained by the magical attacks that they had launched
and by their age.  Seeing this, a small band of demons broke away from
the attacks on Buffy and launched themselves at the two older mages.</p>

<p>Padrick, at a pause in the battle, noticed that neither Amana nor Grael
was still with them.  He turned around to look for them, only to see
them fall under a demon attack.</p>

<p>He yelled to the others, "Alya, Shari, with me.  We need to rescue Amana
and Grael," before rushing back towards the fallen mages.</p>

<p>Just then, everything and everyone on the battlefield, even it appeared
the weather itself, paused.</p>

<p>The demon leader thought to himself, just as a guardian reached out for
him, "Gods, now what could be happening to us now?"</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Willow, totally unaware of the battle raging just outside of the village
was busy funnelling the energy she had collected into the demon network
she had hacked into.  Thinking to herself, "this is taking way too long.
I only hope that I got it right, and that I was able to get enough energy
to do the job," she continued her efforts, anxiety evident in everything
she was doing.  Willow was keenly aware that this was her only shot at
crashing the demon's transportation system.  Given that the village was
under attack she knew that she would most likely be dead before have
a chance to try a second time.</p>

<p>Willow then began to feel a lessening in the amount of energy she was
feeding into the breach.  Thinking, "oh no.  I'm not going to have enough,"
she began cast about in her mind for a solution to her problem.  She
paused and then said, "Goddess, I beseech your aid in my time of need."</p>

<p>Suddenly there were winds, in a realm devoid of an atmosphere.  There
was sound, where there shouldn't be, and then there was a presence of
calm, beauty and serenity.</p>

<p>"Lady," Willow whispered, mentally bowing before the Goddess, "I thank
you for your attendance."</p>

<p>"HUSH CHILD," a voice whispered in Willow's mind, "I TOLD YOU I
WOULD BE HERE, WHEN YOUR NEED WAS GREATEST.</p>

<p>"I thank you, my lady, I would be lost without you.</p>

<p>"HUSH NOW CHILD.  I KNOW OF YOUR NEED, AND I WILL GIVE YOU
THE STRENGTH YOU NEED TO FINISH.</p>

<p>"Once again, my lady, all I can offer is my devotion and my thanks. </p>

<p>"YOU ARE A FAVOURED DAUGHTER.  WHEN THIS IS OVER LOOK
DEEP WITHIN YOURSELF  YOU WILL FIND THE ANSWER TO THE
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE, AND WILL ASK."</p>

<p>With that, enigmatic, comment the presence left Willow's mind and the
magical realm.  Willow then realized that the flow of energy she was
directing to the demon's network had regained, even surpassed, its former
strength. </p>

<p>"Wow," she thought, "when She delivers, She really delivers."</p>

<p>Suddenly the texture and nature of the network began to change before
her eyes.  It began to pulsate and twist, almost as if it was a creature
in pain.  "That's it," Willow thought, "I think that I've got the loop
going.  Time to get out of Dodge city."</p>

<p>She paused for just a second longer, to reassure herself that things
were indeed working the way that she had hoped, then called out, "Aiofe,
Bridie!" </p>

<p>In the circle, the two junior mages heard Willow's call, they paused
for a moment, each review what she needed to do next, before answering,
why simultaneously mentally casting the required spell, "Willow, return
to us.  Return to our existence and to your body."</p>

<p>Willow travelled back through the tenuous link she had maintained with
her body and re-established consciousness within her body.</p>

<p>Just as she stood up, and was turning to address the mages, stillness
descended upon the room and the working circles.  Willow said, "look
sharp folks, something is about to happen."</p>

<p>"Meow," said a very happy familiar.  She had been aware that her human
was 'away' since she had not had contact with her, and was now relived
to see that Willow had returned.</p>

<p>Willow picked up Shadow-Cat and cuddled her for a moment saying, "did
you miss me sweetie?  Its ok, everything is going to be ok now."</p>

<p>Just as Willow finished speaking there was a monumental eruption in the
mountains surrounding the village as well as a corresponding disturbance
in the magical realm.  Willow's plan to cause a feedback loop had worked,
and the hell- mouths, attacked from within, had been simultaneously
destroyed
throughout the world.  The effects of her spell were not only felt on
this world; the reverberations echoed from world to world, causing
substantial
damage to the transportation network on many of them.</p>

<p>The effects were substantial.  Throughout the world demons collapsed
unconscious in pain, and remained out for several hours, and in some
cases for days.  The explosions, which closed the hell-mouths, had also
caused substantial damage to the area surrounding them, fortunately by
this time there was little human habitation left near any of them, and
therefore only demons were caught up in the backlash.</p>

<p>Daithi, and the rest of the slayers and guardsmen realized what had
happened.
As soon as the reverberations shaking the mountains ceased they picked
themselves up and noticed that the demons were all out could, and that
the guardians had disappeared.</p>

<p>Daithi ran over to where Padrick, Shari and Alya were trying to bind
the wounds of the two senior mages, in an almost futile attempt to stop
the bleeding.  They picked up the mages in improvised litters and started
to take them back to the inn, where they hoped that Willow and Buffy
would be able to help in any way. </p>

<p>Buffy regained her mental composure just as the explosion struck.  She
looked around at the damage, at the out cold demons, before noticing
the numerous healed wounds on her body.</p>

<p>Thinking, "I must have been healing myself as I was attacking," she began
to move towards the two litters being carried by Daithi, Padrick and
the others. </p>

<p>&lt;Willow, are you there,&gt; she thought plaintively, hoping that her fears
from earlier were groundless.</p>

<p>&lt;Yes love, how are you?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I'll live, you,&gt; replied the slayer, the relief obvious in her thoughts.</p>

<p>&lt;I guess, but don't ask me to do too much for the next while.  What's
up, you sounded so tense?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I lost contact with you earlier, just before I went berserk.  I thought
that I had lost you.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Must have been when I was detached, in the magical realm.  I'm sorry
I didn't warn you in advance.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Its ok, you had things on your mind.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;See you soon, I promise to kiss and make up.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Yeah, look forward to that.&gt;  Buffy looked around at the carnage, &lt;boy,
we did a number on them.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Yes?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Oh yeah, there are demon bits, and out-cold demons everywhere.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Don't dally, I need you.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Only a minute or so, I'll just check out what Padrick and Daithi are
up to, and I'll hold you to your promise.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;If I told you that you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against
me?&gt; </p>

<p>At that moment Buffy came up to the two guardsmen and saw who was injured
and cried out &lt;Willow!  Amana and Grael have been injured.&gt;

&lt;Bad?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Very.  Finish up as fast as you can, and lets see if we can help.  They
are being taken back to the inn.  Even if we don't have all that much
energy left, we might be able to do something.&gt;</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Three hours later Buffy stood up from a table in the inn's common room,
which had become an improvised infirmary, and turned to Willow.</p>

<p>"They're stable, but it won't last for long, maybe a day or so."</p>

<p>"I know, but neither of us has enough energy, or skill to do much more
for them.  There's massive internal damage."  Willow sat down at an empty
table and began to mechanically eat some of the food that had been laid
out.</p>

<p>"Even if we regain our strength tomorrow," added Buffy, joining her spouse,
"I don't know if we will be able to do much more for them.  This is one
time that magic is not going to replace modern medical knowledge."</p>

<p>"I know," sighed Willow, "I just wish that..."</p>

<p>"Me too.  If only they had not tried to follow me, once I went berserk.
They should have stayed back."</p>

<p>"No, love," replied the arch-mage, "I should have insisted that they
stay with me for the ritual."</p>

<p>"Stop it, both of you," said Aiofe, as she and Bridie, along with two
very hungry little girls, sat down at the table.</p>

<p>"They both knew what they were doing," added Bridie as she passed Kendra
over to her mother, "they knew the risks, and besides, without them adding
to your attack Buffy we might not have had the time to complete the ritual."</p>

<p>"It was a close thing," agreed the slayer, receiving her daughter from
Aiofe, "I... oh I don't know.  Its just not fair for them to not be here
to celebrate." </p>

<p>"Well," said Willow, with a content daughter to the breast, "they're
not dead yet.  Maybe, after a good nights sleep we'll think of something."</p>

<p>"You have to agree," commented Aiofe, "that all in all things have gone
very well."</p>

<p>"Yes, but," said Willow.</p>

<p>"No buts."  Interjected Bridie.  "Earlier today everyone would have given
odds that most of us wouldn't be here this afternoon.  With the exception
of Amana and Grael, and a couple of the other slayers with bumps and
minor cuts, we haven't suffered any major damage."</p>

<p>"In fact," continued Aiofe, "we probably had more damage from the storm
than from the demons."</p>

<p>"Speaking of everyone else," asked Buffy, suddenly noticing the near
empty inn, "where is everyone?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," added Willow, the tiniest hint of concern in her voice.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Aiofe, "the villagers are busy rounding up their livestock
and getting on with their lives."</p>

<p>"The mages are resting, your little spell took a lot out of them," said
Bridie. </p>

<p>"And, the other slayers and the guardsmen..." added Aiofe.</p>

<p>"And," probed Buffy.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Bridie, "they are busy disposing of the demons."</p>

<p>"I guess," said Willow, "that that's definitely a needed chore, and we
can't have them coming to, knowing what they know about us, and this
village." </p>

<p>"Needed," said Daithi entering the common room, "but very, very messy."</p>

<p>"I bet," said Buffy, placing Faith on her shoulder for the post-feeding
burp, "get them all?"</p>

<p>"Yep, not that there were too many left alive.  We also brought one back,"
said the guardsman, "I thought it best to save one for you."</p>

<p>"Why's that," asked a confused slayer, "I got enough during the battle,
at least I think I did."</p>

<p>"This one looks like a leader type," replied Daithi, "maybe the leader."</p>

<p>"That is a different story," said Willow, beginning to return to leader
mode, "give us a few minutes to get the kids and the wounded out of here
and then bring him in."</p>

<p>A half-hour later Daithi led into the common room a very distressed demon
leader, supported by Padrick and Sonya.  The former commander of the
demon army was in very bad shape.  He had barely avoided being drained
of life by one of the guardians, only as a result of the hell-mouth being
closed.  However, the reprieve from death was only temporary, he did
not have much more than an couple of days, at the most, left on this
earth.</p>

<p>"So there's the mighty slayer," he rasped as he collapsed on the floor,
defiant even in death.  "Kill me and be done with it."</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Buffy, unwilling to rise to the bait, "you'll die, but
we need to ask you a few questions first."</p>

<p>"I'm already dead," said the demon, as he began to cough up great amounts
of yellow-green phlegm, "so why would I bother answering any of your
questions?" </p>

<p>"Oh," answered Willow, "you are dying, we know that."</p>

<p>"But," added her lover, "it's the way you die  we can address that."
Buffy stood up and walked over to the demon.  She leaned over him and
then whispered, "you could die, slowly, painfully over the next day or
so.  Or I could end it quick." </p>

<p>"Or," added Willow, "if you don't cooperate we could let you go.  To
go back to your master and report failure."</p>

<p>"I'm certain that your boss would just love to hear, first hand, about
your failure," said Buffy, returning to the table.  "So, now, what's
it going to be?" </p>

<p>"Oh," wheezed the demon, "you make my choice very clear, painfully so.
I'll answer your questions, but my revenge will be that you won't like
them, nor be able to do anything about it."</p>

<p>&lt;What do you think he's talking about,&gt; asked Buffy.</p>

<p>&lt;Don't know, unless it's about what Hugh alluded to.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;You're probably right,&gt; Buffy then addressed the demon, "spill.  What
was your minion Hugh talking about when he was going on about slayers."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Willow, "just what did he mean by the demon leadership taking
steps to eradicate slayers generations before they planned to conquer
the world?" </p>

<p>"Ah," said the demon, his breathing laboured, "concern about your home
world."  Seeing the surprise in Buffy and Willow's eyes he continued,
"oh yes, Hugh was very talkative before he... passed away.  He told me
all about the travels that the two of you have gone through."</p>

<p> "Spill," said Buffy again, steel ringing in her voice, "or I'll just
leave you to die like the dog you are."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll talk."  The demon rose up to his feet and dragged himself onto
a chair, "don't mind if I sit, do you?  Now, where was I, oh yes, slayers."</p>

<p>The demon Talaker then began to relate the history between the demon
hierarchy and slayers.  He began by commenting that the demon alliance
against what he termed human pests had held for over 400 generations,
and that they had never been seriously challenged, except by slayers.
He stated that the common wisdom amongst the demons was that slayers
were humanities defensive gesture against the might of the demons, and
that if they weren't dealt with promptly on a target world that the demons
chances for success were very limited.</p>

<p>He added that a world's slayers, if left unchallenged, would become an
unbeatable force for good.  He also confirmed that the highest priority
the demon leadership gave to a target world was the containment, then
elimination of the slayers. </p>

<p>He paused for a moment, rasping for breath, and his voice nearly mute
with pain.  While he drank from the pitcher of water offered to him Buffy
commented to her lover, &lt;Red, if even half what he says is true, its
very bad news.&gt; </p>

<p>&lt;I agree, but what really gets me is this business about slayers, plural.
We've, or rather, you've always been told that there can only be one
slayer.&gt; </p>

<p>&lt;We knew that was bogus, even before we came here.  Remember Kendra,
and Faith  there were periods of time back home with multiple slayers.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;And a remarkable lack of concise answers from the counsel.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Well, they've never been 'keen' on giving us poor slayers any answers,
remember?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;You're right.  Now lets see if we can get some more out of this piece
of dog meat, before you put him out of his misery.&gt;</p>

<p>"Now," continued the arch-mage, "if you are ready to continue, just what
do you mean by containment and elimination of slayers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean how we get rid of the threat your lover, and her kin, poses
to us," sneered the demon.</p>

<p>He then went on to describe the battles that the demons had fought in
the past against slayers.  How thousands upon thousands of demons would
die, in a vain attempt to eliminate the slayer, for it had seemed that
for every slayer who fell, two would arise in her place.</p>

<p>Finally, he indicated, the demon leadership determined that the only
way to defeat slayers was from within.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "we curtailed our activities on a world, so that demons
become legendary, almost laughed at.  Then we isolate the slayers, by
setting up organizations who have the avowed purpose of 'helping, and
training' the slayers.  In reality, they were, and are, our agents working
to further marginalize slayers in society."</p>

<p>"The counsel," whispered Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the demon lord, chuckling as he did so, "your precious counsel.
And what is just perfect is that even though you have defeated our plans
for this world, and you know the threat we pose to yours, there is nothing
you can do to save your own world."</p>

<p>With that the demon lord took one of his razor sharp talons and ripped
open his own throat, "you'll get nothing more from me," he said as he
breathed his last. </p>

<p>"NO," screamed Buffy.</p>

<p>&lt;Buffy, settle down!&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Our world is doomed  how can I settle down?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;It's not doomed, love, trust me  and don't believe a work that scum
said about us not being able to get home.&gt;</p>

<p>"Now, continued the arch-mage, enveloping her lover in a hug, "I think
a little celebration is in order, given the double significance of this
day." </p>

<p>"Huh," replied Buffy, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Buffy, don't you remember what day this is?"</p>

<p>"Should I," replied the slayer.</p>

<p>"Candlemass," whispered Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied the arch-mage, "it was a year ago tonight that we
arrived on this world."</p>

<p>"You're right," replied Buffy, after thinking for a second, "how is that
part of a celebration for tonight?"</p>

<p>"Well," continued Willow, "we have a number of things to celebrate tonight.
First is our salvation from the demons.  Second, we have the feast of
Imbolg to do.  Finally, we have to give our thanks for the last year,
and the blessings that have come to us, thanks to Her favour."</p>

<p>&lt;There have been a few, haven't there been?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Yes love,&gt; replied Willow, &lt;there have been.&gt;</p>

<p>Willow then proceeded to get the rest of the day organized.  She sent
Aiofe off to the kitchens, to have the cooks prepare a celebratory meal.
Bridie was sent to round up the other mages, to let them know that there
would be a full Imbolg ritual that night.  Daithi and Padrick were sent
into town, to invite all of the villages to the inn for the meal, and
the ritual.</p>

<p>Soon it was evening.    In every window of every building there were
lighted candles and lanterns.  The town had cleaned up as much of the
damage that they could in the time available, and had set the hundreds
of demon bodies on a pyre that lit the sky for miles around. Everyone
had had an excellent meal and was relaxing, waiting until it was time
for the Imbolg ritual.  Many of the residents of the village were in
the common room of the inn, intending to take part in the evening's
festivities.</p>

<p>Willow, Buffy, Aiofe and Bridie were seated in comfortable chairs before
the cheery fire in the common room, relaxing until it was time to start
the ritual.  Both Aiofe and Bridie eyes were half closed, the combination
of the days exertions, with the advanced state of their pregnancies,
was having a very soporific effect on the young women.  Buffy was sitting,
staring into the fire, and enjoying a brandy while she fed her daughter.
Willow was also feeding Kendra, and absently petting Shadow-Cat, who
was curled up on her lap.</p>

<p>Out of the blue, Willow sat up straighter in her chair, dislodging her
familiar, and her daughter in the process.  "Damn," she said, "didn't
want to do that." </p>

<p>"Do what," asked her lover, "coming back from her wool-gathering." </p>

<p>"I think I have a solution to solving Amana and Grael's injuries." </p>

<p>"Say what," asked a semi-conscious Bridie, as she rubbed sleep from her
eyes, "what do you mean by solving their injuries?"</p>

<p>"Simple," replied Willow, "we bring them home, and get them the specialized
medical treatment they need."</p>

<p>"Now, I'm confused," said Buffy, "just how are we going to get home.
Amana and Grael are both out for the count."</p>

<p>"It's like this, lover," replied her spouse, giving Buffy a quick, feather
light kiss, "Amana told me all about the ritual that brought us here,
and tonight is one of the best nights for it."</p>

<p>"And," added Bridie, suddenly alert and cognisant of the import of Willow's
idea, "Aiofe, Frankel and myself were at the ritual last year."</p>

<p>"And," continued Aiofe, "we have all the mages we need for the work."</p>

<p>"So, do you understand," said Willow, the eagerness evident in her voice.</p>

<p>"So, we can go home," replied the slayer, "when did this idea come to
you?" </p>

<p>"While I was mentally reviewing what that scum prattled on about earlier
today," replied Willow, "remember that the Goddess came to me, and said
that I would find the answers within me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but," said Buffy, "what answers, and to what questions?"</p>

<p>"The questions and problems we both have been having.  The homesickness
we've had, and the worry that we've had over our friends and family.
Not to mention finding a way to heal Amana and Grael."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Buffy, "we can go home.  Just how do we do it, and what
does it mean for the rest of the evening?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Aiofe, "if its anything like last time, a lot of work."</p>

<p>"And a very short time to do it in," said Bridie.</p>

<p>"Well," said Willow, "lots of work or not, it's what we're going to do.
So, find Frankel, and lets get the mages working on what we are going
to do.  Buffy, you get some of the villagers to clear out this room,
we'll do the ceremony here." </p>

<p>Three hours later everything was ready.  The common room had been cleared
and scrubbed.  The ritual circle had been marked on the floor, waiting
for the final symbols to be inscribed.  The mages had all had their ritual
baths and were assembled together, dressed in their working robes over
their heavy winter clothing, waiting for the work to begin.  Willow,
Frankel and Aiofe had spent the better part of an hour working out the
details of the transportation ritual with the other mages.  Now Willow
was sitting with her command group, working out the final details of
the evening's work.</p>

<p>"Ok," she said, "we have about an hour to go, and this is how I think
we should do the work tonight.  First, we go ahead with the regular working
for tonight. Then, we will do the transfer spell.  Hopefully I'll be
able to contact Susan or Carol, or maybe even Giles, and they will be
able to complete the counter-point spell back home."</p>

<p>"If not," asked Aiofe, "what then?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Willow, carefully choosing her words, "when I talked
to Grael about this, a couple of months ago, he thought that if needed
I would be able to cast the spell myself, given that my, and Buffy's,
essence resonates from our world.  The difference would, he thought,
be enough to force the completion of the transfer spell."</p>

<p>"Rather not to have to trust to mage musings," said Buffy, "let's hope
that you can contact someone back home."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Willow, "now, to something very important."</p>

<p>&lt;What's that love?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Shush, dear, don't be rude, we've talked about this.&gt;</p>

<p>"That is," continued the arch-mage, "who comes with us?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean," asked Aiofe.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Buffy, who had clued into what Willow had been thinking,
"both Willow and I are now deeply attached to you and Bridie, so, if
you were willing, we would be happy to have you come along."</p>

<p>"That goes for the rest of you also," said Willow turning to Frankel,
Daithi and Sonya, "it goes without saying that the children and Amana
and Grael will be coming."</p>

<p>The other members of Willow's command team were speechless.  They had
known that their leader would be taking the two gravely ill mages with
her, however, they had not conceived of the idea of their going along.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Frankel stood up and said, "Willow, Buffy, thank
you for your kind offer, however, with both Amana and Grael gone I think
that it would be best for me to stay back.  There is still a lot of demons
around, and we are going to have to do a lot of work to rebuild the mage's
counsel." </p>

<p>Sonya turned to her friends and mentors and then said, "likewise, I cannot
take you up on your fine offer.  I, rather we are going to be sorely
needed for the conceivable future.  I can't leave them."</p>

<p>"I understand, and agree, with how both of you feel," said Willow, "Daithi,
how about you?"</p>

<p>"I sorry, Lady," said the guardsman, "I would love to see and experience
your world, but my place is here, rebuilding this one.  I do not wish
you to think that I think you should stay, I know that you must go home,
but I must remain." </p>

<p>"Thank you," said Buffy, "for everything.  We would have been lost without
your support."</p>

<p>Everyone turned to Aiofe and Bridie, who had remained in silent
contemplation
until that point not looking at anyone, even each other.  Bridie looked
up at her lover, and saw her answer mirrored in her eyes.  She whispered
softly, "we'll go.  Both of us have become very close to you, and we
would be lost without you." </p>

<p>Willow and Buffy stood up from the table and went over to the friends
and lovers and embraced them.  Buffy whispered, "thank-you, thank-you
for agreeing to come, we would also have been lost if you had not."</p>

<p>"Lady," said Sonya, once Willow had regained her seat, "there is one
thing I would ask of you."</p>

<p>"Anything," replied Willow, "I'll do anything that time and my powers
permit." </p>

<p>"I would ask you to take Sam with you," replied Sonya, "with what I'm
called to do, and the risk that that duty entails, I would not be able
to provide for her properly."</p>

<p>"No problem, from my perspective," said Willow, "but would she agree?"</p>

<p>"I think yes.  She has no family left here, and staying would only bring
back painful memories of how they were slaughtered.  Maybe if she goes,
her nightmares would also."</p>

<p>"Well," said Buffy, "go ask her.  If she agrees, pack some personal items,
no clothing, and we'd be happy to take her."</p>

<p>"That goes for you two also," added Willow, addressing Bridie and Aiofe,
"go, you have twenty minutes to get packed and get back here."</p>

<p>"Frankel," said Buffy, "I'd ask that you and Sonya do the same for Amana
and Grael.  Pack their personal books and keepsakes, but nothing else."</p>

<p>Finally everything, and everyone was ready.  The symbols had been marked
on the floor, the watchtowers lit.  Amana, Grael, the children, Sam and
even Shadow-Cat were all in the circle, before the altar, waiting for
the second part of the nights work. </p>

<p>Willow took one final look around, reassured herself that everything
was in place, and then started the evenings work with, "Blessed be."</p>

<p>"Blessed be," replied the assembled mages, and the villagers who were
watching the evening's events.</p>

<p>"We have come to this time and to this place," said Willow, "to celebrate
the impending birth of spring.</p>

<p>"It is the time of year that we celebrate initiations and rebirths, and
tonight we give thanks for our salvation.</p>

<p>"We have also gathered tonight to bid farewell.  Buffy and I will be
taking our leave from your community to return to our own world.  For
we have found that although we have struck a mighty blow against the
enemies of mankind today, those same enemies still threaten our home
and world.  Therefore, we must return, to do what we can to help.</p>

<p>"We are also going to bring with us our friends, sorely injured today.
Injured beyond my, or my lover's, skills to save.  The help they need
is on our world, and I owe it to them as their friend, and student, to
bring them to the medical aid they need.</p>

<p>"Also, two of our company have agreed to come with Buffy and me when
we return.  They have become very close to both of us over the past year,
and their absence from our lives, and ours from theirs would be
devastating."</p>

<p>Willow paused for a moment then proceeded to work with Frankel in casting
the circles, raising the protective sphere and invoking the guardians.
She then continued with the rest of the Imbolg ritual, thanking the Goddess
for her gifts, and asking for her assistance in the year to come.  It
was the time to look forward to the promise of spring, and to welcome
the Goddess in her role as maiden. </p>

<p>Once the formal, cyclical, portion of the night's work had been completed
Willow moved onto the special work that was to be done.  She looked around
at the group of skilled practitioners assembled and said, "Blessed be."</p>

<p>"Blessed be," they once again replied.</p>

<p>"It is time for departure," said the arch-mage, "time for us to perform
the work which will open the portal from this world to mine.</p>

<p>"I wish to take this chance to thank all of you.  You have become a
community
to me, and I sorely wish that I could be both here, and home."</p>

<p>Buffy then addressed the assembly by saying, "I too am going to miss
you all.  I've come to see many of you as family, and I will always think
of this place as a home."</p>

<p>On Willow's signal the mages then began the complex chant that would,
the arch- mage hoped, bridge the void between this world and her own.
Willow cast out her second site into the void; following the thread of
the magic she was weaving to look for her own world.  She followed the
thread, until it was barely viable, and once she was certain that she
had found her home, and had received a confirming signal that she had
made contact, she returned to the physical world. </p>

<p>&lt;Found home.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Ready for this?&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Yep.  Will miss this place, but our place is at home, especially since
we are bringing some of our friends.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Mom is going to freak.  I've been gone for a year, and I return with
a wife, lover, a child and half of another one.&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I'm going to be so lectured,&gt; agreed Willow.  She took a deep breath
then yelled out, "dorrys brishey magh!"</p>

<p>Once again, a blue-rimmed portal of darkness appeared before the altar.
Willow sighed with relief and thought, &lt;thank the Goddess, it worked.&gt;</p>

<p>She then looked at the assembled travellers and said, "ok folks, ready
to go?&gt; </p>

<p>Everyone picked up his or her belongings.  Willow and Buffy had their
babies in chest carriers, and they were helping to support the near-comatose
Amana and Grael.  Aiofe and Bridie were also supporting the two senior
mages, while Sam tightly held on to Bridie's free hand.  Shadow-Cat had
been securely ensconced in Willow's backpack.  </p>

<p>As one they stepped into the void, as soon as they did it disappeared
in a flash of light.</p>

<p>Once again Buffy and Willow travelled though the vast expense of darkness,
before rushing to, and through a blue portal, which had suddenly appeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Home," said Buffy, as she looked at the astonished faces surrounding
her. </p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Back in Willow's workroom, in the California town of Sunnydale, her coven
was just winding down from an eventful Imbolg celebration.  Suddenly
the air above the altar was split with a blue-white bolt of light, which
rapidly expanded to portal, larger, by far than the one that had appeared
there before. </p>

<p>"What the..." asked Giles, wanting to get the night's work over with,
and into a nice warm bed, as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"What are we," said Xander, "portal central?"</p>

<p>The black space in the portal was suddenly filled with bodies, numerous
bodies, who were all wearing heavy winter clothing and with packs slung
over their shoulders.</p>

<p>Giles looked at the two women in the lead, they were obviously Buffy
and Willow, but both women had undergone a massive transformation.  Buffy
was incredibly muscled, and with a shock of snow-white hair.  Willow
was also well muscled and her face had the indomitable look of a battle
weary leader written over it.  More startling, it appeared as if both
young women were carrying babies. </p>

<p>Their companions were just as diverse.  There were the two older persons,
being supported by two very pregnant young women and by a severely emaciated
teenaged girl.  Everyone looked very tired, and very relieved to set
down her burdens.</p>

<p>"Willow," said Giles, "back so soon; you just left."</p>

<p>"Oops," said Willow, "looks like I made a little miscalculation there."</p>

<p>"And what's with the changes in you, and your companions," continued
the Giles as he watched the four young women rapidly divest themselves
of the heavy warm clothing.</p>

<p>"Giles," said Buffy walking towards him, steel in her voice, "you and
your damned counsel have a lot to answer for."</p>

<p>"Oh boy," said the watcher, noticing the red sword tattoo which was peeking
over the edge of the slayer's shirt.</p>
