The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 12 by patricia51<p>(By the way, Juliet's devouring of the mint chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream in the previous chapter was in homage to the first season of "Angel" and the incredibly romantic and sad episode "I Will Remember You". I also need to warn that there's sex in this chapter and I was as surprised as anyone else will be as who it turned out to be having it.)<p>"Right now."<p>Juliet looked at Alex, who nodded. "Okay then, Mr. Russo."<p>The walk down to the Late Nite Bite wasn't far but it seemed on one hand to take forever and on the other to take no time at all. They stood at the entrance and Alex and Juliet both took long, deep trembling breaths.<p>"Hey now, none of that," admonished Alex's Father. "This isn't a dragon's den that we are walking into." When both girls looked as though that would have been preferable he smiled and put an arm around each of them.<p>"Juliet, what are you most afraid of right now?"<p>"The same thing I am Daddy," broke in Alex. "That her parents will try to divide us."<p>"And how would they do that?" asked Jerry, as though he had expected that very answer.<p>"By turning me back into a vampire and stripping me of my soul," answered the other girl. "Without it I would not have any capacity anymore for love. Alex would become just another potential meal."<p>"Juliet, a soul is not something that is plucked from a storage bin and delivered on request. Nor can it be simply returned with the receipt and tossed back on the shelf. Souls are bestowed from above and it will always be yours. You can ignore what the conscience that accompanies it tells you; some people are very good at that."<p>"Like my parents?" interjected Juliet in surprise. "Are you saying they have souls too?"<p>"I believe so. I think that whole 'soulless intelligent being' crap is exactly that, regardless of what a TV show or two says. If you are evil it s because you choose to be evil. And you, my dear Juliet, are not evil."<p>With that last comforting remark the trio descended the steps, passing the sign that said "Closed for Repairs".<p>Over an hour later the same three climbed up the stairs and headed for home. This time the two girls looked anything but glum. Smiles predominated and they clung to each other's hands, walking together as a couple. As a couple that had been accepted by the previously dissenting parents of one of them.<p>Theresa was waiting anxiously for the return of her husband and the two girls, both of whom she now considered "hers". She had supper ready on the table and the foursome ate as they talked. She swept them all up into hugs and listened as Juliet went on and on about how accepting her parents had become and how relieved she was to find that they still loved her. Her mother had apologized for the incident with Alex's blood and begged forgiveness from them both. She even giggled a bit and looked sideways at the two older Russos when she talked about how much her Father seemed to be in charge of her Mother now.<p>"Like it should be," Juliet finished with a twinkle in her eyes.<p>"Of course," remarked Theresa in a tone dry enough to make the perfect martini. Jerry puffed up for a moment and then relaxed and laughed.<p>"I'll have you know young lady that I AM the head of this family. And I have Mrs. Russo's permission to say that!"<p>The foursome broke into gales of laughter. The older Russos kissed Alex and Juliet and sent them up to their room.<p>"Tomorrow is a school day and you need to study. Honework and all that. And Alex?"<p>"Yes Mother?"<p>"Do your homework yourself. No elves, no tutors, no magic."<p>Alex sighed. Somehow being a respectable girl in love seemed to have its downside too. She just couldn't muster the interest in finding ways to get out of things like she used to.<p>After the girls had gone up to their room Jerry checked to make sure their bedroom door was closed. He returned to the kitchen and collapsed into a handy chair with a sigh of relief. Theresa walked up behind him and rested her hands on his shoulders.<p>"So it really went that well?"<p>"Yes it did." Jerry shifted his weight and reached in his back pocket. He produced a wand and laid it on the table. "Speaking of that, the boys got home alright?"<p>"They beat you back home by fifteen minutes. Weren't you taking an awful chance? And why didn't you tell the girls?"<p>"Tell them what? That I had what was fortunately a completely unfounded worry that something might happen today? They were worried enough as it was. I was able to calm their fear that Juliet's parents would try to turn her into a vampire again. Even though she didn't say anything I think Alex was afraid that Cindy Van Heuson would attempt to do her harm. I was pretty sure from talking to Alucard that he wouldn't have allowed either to have happened but better safe than sorry."<p>Theresa leaned over and hugged him tightly, then straightened and began to massage his shoulders.<p>"The boys were eager to help. The family has grown much closer since Juliet moved in."<p>"I was proud of both of them," Jerry agreed as he relaxed, rolling his head as Theresa's firm hands rubbed the tension knots away. "Justin has always had a deep protective streak when it comes to his sister. I'm glad Max is showing one too. They were right outside, wands at the ready and determined to make like the US Cavalry if something had gone wrong." He chuckled. "I sensed that Max was almost disappointed that there wasn't any need for magic."<p>"And you?" inquired Theresa as she gently pushed Jerry forward and settled her hands on his back. "All that preparation and you didn't use any magic either."<p>"Actually I did," Jerry laughed. He reached up and seemed to pull at his hair. Merlin's Hat suddenly appeared and he tossed it on the table. "The first thing I did when I put this on was to turn it invisible."<p>"One more question."<p>"I doubt that my darling," smiled Jerry. "You are always full of questions." He jumped with a strangled yelp as Theresa pinched him.<p>"Seriously."<p>"Okay, seriously."<p>"You made arrangements to be all magiced up for this visit. But when you went to see the Van Heusons the first time you had no magical protection at all. What would have happened had they blamed you for losing their daughter or at least contributing to that loss?"<p>Jerry shrugged. "It was a chance I had to take. Alex was worried about Juliet. And once she explained her worries to me and i started watching our new addition to the family I could see that Alex was right. Darling, whether it lasts only till tomorrow or until the end of time Juliet is the center of Alex's world." He smiled and looked over his shoulder. "As you are of mine. For our daughter's sake I had to see if I couldn't do something. Fortunately Alucard and Cindy wanted to see Juliet as much as she wanted to see them"<p>"Oh I understand," whispered Theresa as she leaned closer to Jerry. Her arms slid around his neck and her lips touched his ear. "After all, Alex looks at Juliet like I still look at you."<p>Jerry turned his head and kissed his wife. Without releasing her hold on him Theresa slipped sideways and bumped the kitchen table with one hip. Still kissing she straddled her husband and sat down on his lap still facing him.<p>"Theresa!" whispered Jerry between kisses that grew deeper and more passionate. "What about the kids?"<p>The older woman Russo giggled softly as she planted her feet firmly on the floor and slid back and forth on the growing bulge in his pants. "I locked the door when you came back in. Just in case this happened."<p>Jerry's hands wandered up from Theresa's hips to touch her breasts. "I see that wasn't the only way you seem to have prepared. Just in case this happened." His touch revealed that she was wearing no bra under her bright yellow dress. His fingers hooked the thin spaghetti straps and eased them down Theresa's arms, who let go long enough to pull her arms out of the straps, letting her heavy breasts fall free. Jerry took immediate advantage of that cup them, his thumbs stroking the already hard dark brown nipples to full hardness.<p>"Mmmm, yes Jerry," she sighed happily. The fingers that had been playing with her husband's neck tightened and she guided his open mouth to her right breast. He engulfed it, running his tongue over the full rounded orb and then taking it in. His tongue swirled over the full dark aureole and lashed the nipple tipping it. Satisfied at the nubbins hardness he switched to his wife's left breast and repeated his actions.<p>Theresa groaned. She raised her body slightly. Jerry's lips tightened on her nipple and tugged against its rise. Nearly frantic now, with her head tipped back and her eyes closed, Theresa fumbled between them. It was almost impossible to free Jerry from his slacks with his erection straining the material tight. Finally he popped free. She pulled her sodden panties to one side and guided him into her. As wet as she was she was able to sit right down onto him and she barely managed to stifle a cry of passion as he slid deep inside her.<p>Jerry darted back and forth from one full breast to the other. Finally he took Theresa's right nipple in his teeth, applying gentle pressure and holding it. As the aroused woman bounced up and down, moving faster and faster each time. she stretched her breast and pulled her nubbin against the her husband's hold. Locking her hands on his shoulders she leaned back. His hands slid under her, fingers disappearing under her panties and gripping her full rounded bottom.<p>"Jerry, Jerry, oh Jerry," the frantic Latina moaned. Each time she impaled herself on his hardness she rolled her hips, grinding her most sensitive pearl against him. He groaned in return. She could feel his throbbing inside her and knew his release was only seconds away. She pulled back even farther and he yanked his head. She dropped all the way down and squeezed her legs as the hot-blooded Italian man exploded inside her. Her own tidal wave swept her away and she fell forward, burying her face on his shoulder.<p>When the shudders finally calmed she lifted her head. Dark eyes sparkling she kissed him. He smiled back at her and touched her face.<p>"For that I would face an entire room full of vampires any day."<p>"I love you Jerry Russo."<p>"And I love you Theresa Magdalena Margarita Larkin Russo."<p>The two snuggled together until Theresa stood up. "My legs are killing me like this."<p>"You didn't seem to notice that earlier," Jerry teased.<p>"My attention was occupied elsewhere," Theresa responded with a naughty grin. "Let's go to bed."<p>"Sounds good to me."<p>"Jerry, you were right," Theresa said as she unfastened the kitchen door.<p>"I was? About what?"<p>"I have one more question."<p>Jerry grinned. The grin turned into an affextionate smile and he kissed her. "What?"<p>"Is it all over now? I mean the drama with Juliet and all?"<p>"Not quite. There's one more thing that needs to be dealt with."<p>(To Be Continued)<p>(I KNOW. I'm a stinker to end the chapter like this. Sorry this took so long. Work has been a madhouse lately. I hope it will soon get back to normal and I can get back on schedule with this story.)
