<!-- Realms \ Part 14 -->

<p>Faith stood out side Tara's room crying, she wanted to knock on the
door, to hold the blonde in her arms, and tell her every cruel word
the warlock had spoken, but she couldn't.  Instead she found herself
staring at the door, afraid to go inside, what if he was right, what
if she was nothing but a feeble attempt by Tara to replace Red. Maybe
they all would be better off without her.  Faith tuned away from the
door, hung her head low, and began to walk away.</p>

<p>"D-don't you want to see me?"</p>

<p>Faith stopped when she heard Tara's question, slowly she turned
around and looked up at the blonde who was now standing out in the
hallway.</p>

<p>Tara felt as if her heart was going to break when she saw the anguish
that filled the brunette slayers eyes.  She walked over to Faith and
placed her hands on the girls shoulders, "What's wrong."</p>

<p>Faith looked at Tara through tear stained eyes, and managed to get
out the one word that said it all, "Warlock."</p>

<p>Tara's mind filled with fear as she recalled the damage the Warlock
had done to the brunette slayer, she took Faith gently by the arm and
led the slayer into her room.  Once inside she shut the door and
began examining Faith for whatever type of injury that the vial
warlock might had caused her.</p>

<p>A smile crept onto Faith's face as the blonde carefully ran her hands
over her body,  "Uh, Tara not that I mind the attention or anything
but what are you doing?" huskily replied the brunette slayer.</p>

<p>"I-I'm checking to see if you're injured."</p>

<p>The tears once again began to roll down Faiths face, her voice filled
with despair as she struggled to get the words out, "I'm not, he
didn't even try to attack, guess I'm not worth the effort."</p>

<p>"Why would you even think something like that?"</p>

<p>"It's true, even before Buffy was transformed into this all powerful
super slayer I was second rate compared to her and now I'm nothing
but a hindrance. They're better off without me, you're better off
with out me," sobbed Faith.</p>

<p>Tara wrapped her arms around Faith and pulled the brunette up against
her, "I don't know what the warlock did to you but whatever he said
isn't true. It doesn't matter that Buffy has become a warrior of
light or that Willow is a mage, they still need your help more than
you realize.  And the part about me being better off without you, I
don't know how you got that in your head but it's not true.  I need
you Faith."</p>

<p>"Why could you possibly need me?" wept Faith.</p>

<p>"B-because I l-love you."</p>

<p>"You do?"</p>

<p>Tara leaned into Faith until their lips where less than an inch
apart, "I do," she softly replied before closing the rest of the
distance and kissing the brunette slayer.</p>

<p>Tara gently pulled away from Faith and led her over to the bed, "Sit."</p>

<p>Faith sat down, and took a deep breath as Tara sat down beside her.
She turned to the blonde, "W-what are we doing?" nervously inquired
Faith.</p>

<p>"We're going to talk about what happened tonight with the Warlock."</p>

<p>Tara could feel the anger mounting inside her as she listened to the
warlocks venomous words, and for the first time in her life she felt
the urge to use her powers to destroy someone.</p>

<p>Tara rested her head on Faith's shoulder, and began to softly speak
to her, "Everything he told you, was nothing more than lies meant to
hurt you.  You're a very special person, and your friends need you
more than you realize. That's why the warlock did what he did.  He
knows how important you are to everyone and hoped that if he got you
out of the picture everything would fall apart."</p>

<p>Faith tenderly kissed Tara on the cheek, "I don't know what I did to
deserve you coming into my life, but I do know that I love you."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Willow leaned up against Buffy as the two of them listened to Tara
tell them what the warlock had said to Faith and reassured the
brunette slayer that this was nothing but viscous lies.</p>

<p>Buffy looked over at Faith and smiled at her fellow slayer, "You know
Tara's right, you're very important to all of us."</p>

<p>"But the two of you have become so powerful, what could.  ."</p>

<p>Buffy jumped back into to the conversation cutting off Faith in mid
sentence, "Listen to me, it doesn't matter if I'm a warrior of light,
a slayer, or a pompom girl, your still going to be my friend, and I
need that more than anything.  Besides rumor has it that you're a
pretty good slayer."</p>

<p>"She's right Faith, we both need you to be there, to support us, and
to help us fight all the bad nastiness that are out there.  Just like
you always have," replied Willow.</p>

<p>"You mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Buffy and Willow in unison.</p>

<p>"B, Red . . .Thanks."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it that's what friends are for.  How about if we get
this patrol over with so we can figure out how to kick the warlocks
butt back to whatever rock he crawled out from under," replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me B."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The Grey Demon clenched his fist as he stepped out from the tree line
and watched the four young women walk away from the college campus.
He tuned and glared at Ciarán then slammed his power fist into a
nearby tree.  "You failed," snarled Torin.</p>

<p>"I did as you asked, it's not my fault that the slayer didn't leave
or come running to us."</p>

<p>"Do you know who you are speaking to?" growled Torin.</p>

<p>"Yes I do, and assassin demon or not it was your plan that failed.
It was your plan that brought them all closer together instead of
pulling them apart.  If you're so afraid of the Warrior of Lights
friend being able to stop your attempt on her life then I suggest
that you let me deal with them."</p>

<p>"And what would you do?"</p>

<p>"I would annihilate them."</p>

<p>"That would alert her and the Mage to our plans," snapped Torin.</p>

<p>"Yes, but their allies and families would be dead and they would be
alone."</p>
