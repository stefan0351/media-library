<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ I'm Looking For Something In Red -->

<p>Brooke shifted through the racks of dresses looking for
something, anything remotely like what she had in mind but it was becoming
increasingly clear that she was going to have to have something specially made.
She was beginning to think the whole thing was hopeless and she could tell that
Sam was nearing the end of her patience. She wondered how Sam could have such a
short attention span when it came to shopping. </p>
<p>"Any luck?" Sam asked in a monotone from the chair a few feet
away in the boutique. God, she was bored. She figured Brooke had tried on at
least 30 dresses. While it was somewhat fun to watch, it wasn't high on Sam's
list of how to spend an afternoon. (I'm growing old over here) Sam lamented.
Brooke walked out from behind the rack and shook her head defeatedly.
</p>
<p>"Nope," she sighed. "I'm gonna have to go to the dressmaker
that made our wedding gowns and have something made." Sam stood up and
stretched. Brooke watched the display with a lazy smile. Sam quirked an eyebrow
at her. </p>
<p>"Enjoying the show?" she asked with a smirk. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh, especially the way your shirt rode up," Brooke told
her. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"And you say I'm bad," she joked, wrapping an arm around
Brooke's waist as they left the boutique. Brooke laughed and pinned Sam against
the car with a passionate kiss. </p>
<p>"You're rubbing off on me," Brooke rasped after breaking away.
Sam placed her index finger on the end of Brooke's nose. </p>
<p>"That's not necessarily a bad thing," she grinned. "Unless it
gets us arrested," she added as an afterthought. "Where to now?" Brooke thought
a minute. </p>
<p>"Well, the dressmaker, I guess. I know exactly what I want,
Sammy and I think that's the only way I'm going to get it." Sam opened the car
door for her. </p>
<p>"Your wish, Princess, is my command. Your chariot awaits," Sam
said galantly with a bow for added effect. Brooke giggled. </p>
<p>"And they say chivalry is dead," Brooke quipped. </p>

<p>Now Sam sat reading a pathetically outdated magazine while
Brooke discussed dresses with Arlene, the dressmaker. (Time magazine from March
1999? Ug, and I thought the hospital magazines were bad) Sam thought to herself.
But at least Brooke had finally found someone who shared her vision of her prom
dress. And it looked to Sam like the search was finally drawing to a close and
for that she was immensely grateful. </p>
<p>"What do you think, Sammy? Red or blue?" Brooke's voice
floated over to her. Sam looked up at her. </p>
<p>"Well, the blue would match your eyes but the red would look
REALLY sexy," Sam answered after a minute's thought and with a wicked grin.
Brooke smiled back at her. </p>
<p>"Red it is then," she said turning back to Arlene. "I'll go
with red, in this shade," she pointed to a sample out of Sam's view. "And we'll
need a matching pants set in her size," Brooke said pointing at Sam. Arlene
nodded. </p>
<p>"We still have her measurements from when your parents got
married," Arlene said with a smile. "Are you sure she wouldn't want a dress for
the prom instead?" </p>
<p>"She's sure," Sam piped up before Brooke could open her mouth.
Brooke shrugged at Arlene. </p>
<p>"We're sure," she echoed Sam's statement. Arlene nodded her
understanding. </p>
<p>"All right then. We'll get started on it and give you two a
call for fittings," Arlene said. Brooke smiled and nodded happily. </p>
<p>"Great, thanks again, Arlene, for seeing us on such short
notice," she said. </p>
<p>"Not a problem, Brooke," Arlene said. Brooke and Sam got up to
leave. "Talk to you later." </p>
<p>"Bye Arlene," Sam called from the door. </p>
<p>"Bye, Sam, Brooke." </p>

<p>Sam waited for the light to turn and watched Brooke out of the
corner of her eye. </p>
<p>"Happy now?" she asked quietly. Brooke turned to look at her
from the passenger seat. </p>
<p>"About what?" she asked slightly confused. </p>
<p>"That you're going to get the perfect dress?" Sam clarified.
Brooke smiled a self-satisfied smile. </p>
<p>"Yes, yes I am," she responded. "Aren't you?" </p>
<p>"If you're happy, I'm happy, Princess," Sam told her. Brooke
tilted her head slightly. </p>
<p>"Are you?" Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Yes, Brooke, I am. I may be reluctant to go but if it's
making you happy, then it's making me happy," Sam told her firmly. Brooke
smiled. </p>
<p>"Thank you Sammy." </p>
<p>"You're welcome, Princess. I do have a question or two,
though." </p>
<p>"OK, shoot," Brooke told her. </p>
<p>"Do you want to rent a limo or take one of our own cars?" Sam
asked. Brooke frowned and thought about it for a few minutes. </p>
<p>"What do you want?" she asked Sam. Sam shook her head.
</p>
<p>"This is your night, Princess, not mine. I asked you because
it's your night," Sam explained to her. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"OK, fine. Yes, then. I want a limo," she said. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"OK, done," Sam said. "Your wish is my command." Brooke
smiled. </p>
<p>"So what is this? I'm Cinderella and you're my Fairy Godmother
and those cute little mice all in one?" she joked. Sam snickered. </p>
<p>"And I'd like to think your Prince too," Sam added. She then
rethought her comment. "Hey, how did I end up the masculine part of this
couple?" Brooke burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"You did that yourself, Missy. `I hate dresses', `I'm your
Prince'. It's all you, Sammy," she explained through her laughter. Sam sighed
and rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Grrrr?." Brooke just laughed all that much harder at her. </p>
