<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 4-->

<p>Sam twirled her pencil around in between her fingers as she stared at the
text book in front of her.  Calculus, how she hated it so.  She was
concentrating so intently on the question in front of her that she didn't
hear when someone entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>Brooke walked into the kitchen stopping in her tracks when she noticed the
figure at the table.  She froze for a moment anticipating Sam's glance but
it never came.  Staying where she was Brooke took a closer look at the girl
and realized that she didn't even know that she had entered the room.  There
was a slight wrinkle in her forehead and her fingers drummed against the
table top while her other hand spun a pencil around restlessly.  Brooke felt
a small smile spread across her face caused by the pure preciousness of the
situation.  Sam sat there unguarded and natural and Brooke was captivated.</p>

<p>This had to stop.  They had to talk, Brooke decided.  She couldn't take it
anymore, she didn't want to take it anymore.  She was confident that the
reason she was so preoccupied with what had happened that night was because
she hadn't gotten any closure.  What she need was to gloat and have Sam
acknowledge that she had won, and then life could go back to normal.  Yes,
she was certain that that was what was wrong, that had to be what was wrong
because there was absolutely no way in the universe that she could actually
be falling for Sam.  The idea that she could be falling for Sam was simply
insane.  In other words it was insanity and it was not to be acknowledged at
all, especially when this handy excuse was present.</p>

<p>"I think we need to talk," Brooke said announcing her presence.  The pencil
fell out of Sam's hand at the sound of Brooke's voice and her fingers
stopped mid-drum.  She looked over that the blonde, her face completely
expressionless.</p>

<p>"About what?  I don't know anything about the new Donna Karen collection,"
Sam responded dryly.  She was actually quite impressed with herself
considering that her heart was pounding a mile a minute and her palms were
beginning to sweat.  God she hated Brooke.</p>

<p>"You know about what," Brooke said refusing to say it out loud.  Voicing
things, hearing the spoken words always seemed to make things seem more real
and Brooke liked thinking of what happened as a surreal experience.</p>

<p>"No.  I don't," Sam responded just as stubbornly.</p>

<p>"About that night.  That the thing happened," Brooke said elaborating as
vaguely as possible.</p>

<p>"Why?" Sam asked her eyes involuntarily tracing Brooke's form.  Truthfully
she was surprised the blonde was brining it up.  She had assumed that Brooke
had forgotten about what happened, or that if she hadn't forgotten she would
have proceeded with burying the memory at the back of her brain never to be
seen or heard from again.  This wanting to talk about it threw Sam off.  It
was what she would have considered un-Brooke like, however, she was coming
to realize that she didn't really know as much about Brooke as she liked to
think, and some of things she thought she knew she didn't really know at
all.</p>

<p>"Because," Brooke responded rather peevishly.  Why couldn't Sam just give in
like a normal person.  It wasn't like she was asking for a lung, she just
wanted to talk to her.</p>

<p>"Because why?"</p>

<p>"Just because alright," Brooke said getting a bit flustered.  She should
have expected this.  She did expect this, but still, she didn't really
expect it.</p>

<p>"I can see that this is going to be a stimulating conversation," Sam
responded caustically.  She often got that way when she was trying to hide
her own discomfort.  She was actually so interested in what Brooke was going
to say that she almost made herself sick.  She was smitten with McQueen and
it made her stomach tie up in knots and her heart flutter at the same time.
God, she hated Brooke.</p>

<p>"Listen, this can be over with real quick, all I want is some closure,"
Brooke replied.</p>

<p>"Closure?  Was there ever an opening?"  Sam asked genuinely confused as to
what the other girl was getting at.  She was beginning to wonder if they
were talking about the same thing.</p>

<p>"Yes.  All you have to do is admit that I was right and you were wrong and
we can all get back to our normal existences,"  Brooke responded shifting
her weight from foot to foot nervously.</p>

<p>"Admit you were right about what?" Sam demanded standing up.  "I don't know
what you're talking about but I'm sure that you weren't right."  Sam was
actually a bit comforted by this turn of events.  She knew this terrain, she
knew how to fight with Brooke and trade barbs and annoy and heckle.  It was
the coy glances and sexual tension that threw her off.</p>

<p>"That's so...so...Sam!" Brooke responded in an exasperated tone.  The nervous
energy in the room was picking up in intensity and neither of them seemed to
know what to do with it.  "You were wrong about me so just say sorry and
shut up!"</p>

<p>"I was wrong?  About you?  Brooke, what the hell are you talking about?" Sam
asked incredulously her head was starting to hurt.  She couldn't really
defend her point unless she knew what she was arguing for.</p>

<p>"You said I was being chic," Brooke answered in a softer tone, her gaze
skittering away from Sam's.</p>

<p>"So?" Sam replied although she knew exactly where the blonde was going.</p>

<p>"So I kissed you," Brooke responded so softly Sam almost didn't hear her.</p>

<p>"So?" Sam asked again even though her heart skipped a beat at Brooke's
words.</p>

<p>"So I proved I wasn't being chic.  You were wrong and I was right."</p>

<p>"That didn't prove anything," Sam replied immediately.  She didn't even know
why she couldn't just let it go.  If she just did what Brooke asked then
that would be the end of it.  But she just couldn't seem to bring herself to
do it.  It was almost as if she didn't want it to be over.  "That just
proves you'll do anything to win a bet."</p>

<p>Brooke stared at the brunette incredulously.  She couldn't believe the words
she was hearing.</p>

<p>"You.  Are.  Unbelievable," Brooke finally breathed out.  "I shared with
you, I did everything you asked even to your stupid ass proposal, and now
you're....what the hell is wrong with me?" Brooke responded with a touch of
wonderment in her voice.  "To think that I ever even considered the
possibility that you had human emotions, that I actually was..." she stopped
there realizing that she was about to voice her attraction to Sam and that
under the circumstances that was not the thing to do.</p>

<p>"You actually what?" Sam asked her voice barely a whisper.  "You actually
what?" she asked again when Brooke dropped her gaze to the floor and made a
motion as if she was going to leave the room.</p>

<p>"You really want to know?" Brooke asked looking up at Sam again.  She felt
as if she was losing control of herself.  She wanted this to end, but she
also wanted it to continue.  She could feel Sam's heat, sense her passion.
It was one of the most intimate situations she had ever been in, and even
though she knew that it was a mistake she wanted to finish it properly, she
had to say her piece.  "Do you want me to tell you so that you can dig into
me again and attack me?  Because I'll tell if you ask."</p>

<p>"Why?"  Sam asked particularly struck by the last part of Brooke's
statement.</p>

<p>"That's part of the answer," Brooke responded mysteriously her eyes misting
over.  Sam always did bring out her emotions.  No one made her feel like the
girl standing in front of her and she knew that that would be the end of
her.  That Sam and all Sam was and all Sam did to her would wreck her.  But
she couldn't stop, because it was Sam, and with Sam she could never hold
back.  It was passion.  It had always been passion she rapidly came to
realize.</p>

<p>"I want to know," Sam replied softly her eyes locked on Brooke.  There was
something going on inside of the other girl, she could sense it building,
like the coming tide and she wanted it to wash over her.</p>

<p>"That I was attracted to you.  That you...of all the people in world had to be
the one that I wanted.  That I actually believed a day would come when we
would be able to have a civil conversation and I would, at the very least,
be able to say that I 'knew' you," Brooke responded.  And as unbelievable as
it sounded, it was true.  Sam McPherson had been sexually frustrating her
for her entire adolescence.</p>

<p>Sam closed her eyes are Brooke finished breaking the intimate link the girl
had established and took in a deep, shuddering breath.  Brooke McQueen had
just admitted at long standing attraction to her that was more than just
skin deep.  She was absolutely stunned.  She was absolutely exhilarated and
she didn't want to be.  Brooke was everything that she was not, was
everything that she detested.  She was popular, and vain, and arrogant
and-Sam finally had to admit to herself-smart and sensitive and caring, and
most certainly beautiful.  Sam had to admit that of all the people she knew,
none of them got to her like Brooke did.  None of them made her as crazy, or
as interested, or as captivated.  No one made her as attracted to them.  She
wanted Brooke, and she hated Brooke?  No, she just wanted her, and in some
way she knew she always had.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to say anything?" Brooke asked softly breaking Sam out of
her revere.  Sam opened her eyes and looked at the figure in front her.  She
took two steps and forward and paused momentarily gauging Brooke's reaction.
  The cheerleader stood absolutely still.  Sam took another step forward so
that she was now standing directly in front of Brooke and without a moment's
thought or hesitation she reached out placing her hand behind Brooke's neck
and crushed their lips together.  It was not the tentative, shy kiss that
they had shared before, but one born of pure passion, of years of unknown
pent up desire.  It was fire.</p>

<p>Brooke moaned softly into Sam's mouth as her hands reached up to hold the
shorter frame in front of her.  There was now no space between their bodies,
they were tangled together in a heated embrace, all hunger and passion and
need.  There was no thought in this place, no logic, no reason, no denial,
only truth and feeling.</p>

<p>Brooke's hand crept up Sam's side as the brunette turned her attention to
ravaging every available inch of skin on the blonde's neck.  Sounds of
passion filled the room, whose they were was unknown and irrelevant.
Brooke's hand made it to the underside of Sam's breast and instinctively she
cupped it, squeezing gently causing Sam to release a guttural moan and
shudder against as Brooke's thumb grazed her nipple.</p>

<p>This sound of pure, undiluted pleasure, this verbalization of the intensity
of the attraction between them cleared up the haze surrounding them like a
bucket of cold water to the face.  The sun was rising in their world of
dark, the rays bringing with it the realization of what they were doing and
legs and arms freed themselves and mouths were removed from their conquered
territory leaving two girls shaking in its wake.</p>

<p>"What's happening?" Sam breathed out finally resisting her sudden urge to
distance herself physically from Brooke.  Running was not going to answer
her questions or solve the situation between the two of them.  They were now
past the point of denial.</p>

<p>"Groping," Brooke replied her gaze flittering around the kitchen before
returning to Sam, a small smile crossing her face.</p>

<p>"Between us," Sam clarified as her eyes raked over Brooke's body before
focusing on the girl's slightly swollen lips.  'I did that' Sam thought to
herself as she gazed at them.  'I want to do it again' she admitted.</p>

<p>"Groping," Brooke responded once more.  Sam looked at her questioningly.
Her eyes were glazed over and there was a noticeable flush to her skin.  She
wasn't quite sure what to make of it.</p>

<p>"I'm serious."</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke responded.  "Technically I was correct, though I realize
your inquiry was of a more philosophical nature.  Truthfully, I'd like to
give you a better answer, but...well to put it as tactfully as possible, my
brain isn't getting much blood right now which is making coherent thought
very difficult," the blonde continued.  Her eyes were raking over Sam
hungrily and Sam realized that they were really in the same boat on this
particular subject.</p>

<p>"What kind of thought isn't difficult?"</p>

<p>"Naughty thoughts," Brooke responded a slow smile stretching across her
face.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Sam moaned and she screwed her eyes shut tightly.  She had to
think, she couldn't think if she was looking at Brooke while the other girl
flirted with her and ravaged her with her eyes.  "We can't do this...here, I
mean..." Sam said opening her eyes and trailing off as she realized she wasn't
exactly sure what she meant.  Every neuron in her body was telling her grab
Brooke and never let go, and her mind was telling her that things had to
stop, had to slow down.</p>

<p>As Sam spoke, Brooke immediately turned her head and looked into the living
room.  More accurately she looked at the plush couch in the living room.</p>

<p>"Not there either," Sam said following her gaze realizing what Brooke was
thinking.  "Not now.  Not...I don't even know...I week ago I couldn't stand
you...this is fast, this is very fast...this is practically warp."</p>

<p>"You watch Star Trek?" Brooke asked momentarily throwing Sam off of track.
She seemed to do that a lot.  Nobody else did that to her, but Brooke seemed
to be a natural.</p>

<p>"I...no....it's common knowledge," Sam replied distractedly as she looked into
Brooke's eyes.</p>

<p>A silence came over the room, as the two of them merely stood there
observing each other, until Brooke broke it.</p>

<p>"I want to..." Brooke said stopping mid-sentence and reaching out to Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh god," Sam moaned again as Brooke's wrapped her arms around Sam's waist
and drew them together again.</p>

<p>"You're right," Brooke breathed practically into Sam's ear.  "I mean...we
don't even understand what's happening...where this is going...or even what
we're doing.  I only know two things... and one if them is that I don't know
anything.  The other is that at the moment I can't seem to bare the thought
of you being out of my arms...and...and I want you to come upstairs with me."</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you too," Sam said resting her head on Brooke's
shoulder and breathing in her scent, shuddering slightly.  "You're not the
only one with a circulation problem at the moment, and I know that right now
I would do just about anything you ask me to because my brain seems to be
slipping further and further south whenever you touch me. But, if we
do...something, we'll regret it, and I don't want to regret this."</p>

<p>Brooke placed her hand on Sam's face and brought the other girls eyes up to
meet hers.</p>

<p>"I wasn't propositioning you.  I just...I just want to be near you.  I...I think
we can handle it," Brooke said softly, her eyes searching Sam's.</p>

<p>"Because we've done a really good job controlling ourselves so far," Sam
replied in a slightly amused voice as she felt Brooke's hand begin to rub
small circles on her back.  Her eyes fluttered shut, and she felt her breath
catch.</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't be an adult about it then..." Brooke started to say in a
teasing tone, but Sam interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Oh, and you're saying that you can be?  You're the one that's feeling me up
right at this very moment."</p>

<p>"I..." Brooke started to reply before she realized that she was indeed feeling
Sam up.  "I didn't say it would be easy," Brooke finally responded in a
whisper next to Sam's ear.  Sam leaned into her and wrapped her arms around
Brooke's waist.  It was if the cheerleader were some sort of fantastic drug.</p>

<p>"Challenges make us stronger people," Sam responded as she nuzzled Brooke's
neck.  She was sure that she was trying to convince herself with the
statement because Brooke already seemed to have acquiesced to her desires
and the situation at hand.</p>

<p>"Very true," Brooke mumbled as her eyes closed and look of pure bliss spread
across her face as Sam's lips moved against her skin.</p>

<p>"We should go to bed."</p>

<p>"Definitely."</p>
