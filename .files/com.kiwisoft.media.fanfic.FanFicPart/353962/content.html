<!-- About a Girl \ Part 20 -->

<p><i><u>Katie's House - Two weeks later (a.k.a. Jessie's first night of freedom)</u></i></p>

<p>"When are your parents coming home?" Jessie asked as she curled up  against Katie's side.  They were in Katie's bedroom, lying down on  her bed watching Gladiator, Jessie was convinced, for no other reason  other than the hotness of Connie Neilson.</p>

<p>"Late," Katie replied pressing a kiss to Jessie's forehead.  "That  new medicine they've got mom on is really making an improvement and  they went to celebrate.  Which mean have wild, loud sex in a classy  motel … which is code for ones with specialty rooms," Katie  continued.  She didn't often talk about her mom's depression because  she didn't really know what to say about it, other than that it  really sucked and was hard, but she knew that no matter what she said  around Jessie it'd be okay, because she had gone through the same  thing with her mom.</p>

<p>"Okay, ewwww," Jessie responded making a face at the thought of  anyone their parents age having sex.</p>

<p>"I know which is why they went to a motel, to spare me the emotional  distress of hearing through the walls.  And really, I thank them for  that," Katie replied before getting distracted by the feel of  Jessie's hand moving on her stomach, where it had been resting, and  starting to slip underneath the material.</p>

<p>Katie took in a sharp breath as she then felt Jessie's hand begin to  move on the bare skin of her stomach, taking a deep breath to try and  calm her breathing which was becoming rapidly erratic.  As Jessie's  hand continued move across her skin, she began to feel herself flush  with warmth.  "Wha…what are you doing?" Katie asked her mind  beginning to flood with very naughty thoughts.</p>

<p>Jessie's hand stilled and she looked up at Katie nervously.  "Do you  want me to stop?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"No," Katie responded immediately.  "But I have to admit, I'm not  exactly thinking clearly at the moment," she continued as she felt  her head start to spin.</p>

<p>"You're not?" Jessie asked pushing against her more tightly though  she kept her hand still.</p>

<p>"Nnn…oo," Katie replied shivering at the feel of Jessie so close to  her.</p>

<p>"Is that good thing or a bad thing?" Jessie asked already knowing the  answer, but wanting an excuse to stay pressed up against Katie.</p>

<p>"It certainly feels like good thing," Katie exhaled softly smiling,  the smile fading to be replaced by another gasp as Jessie started to  move her hand again.  This time tentatively pushing up the material  of Katie's shirt to reveal her abdomen.  She stared down at the pale  skin, lightly moving up and down, before lowering her head so that it  was bent over Katie's stomach.  Then she closed the remaining  distance between her lips and Katie's stomach, planting small, wet  kisses all over the skin, then leaning back slightly and blowing on  the skin, watching as little goose bumps appeared all over.  At this  Katie felt a surge of electricity shot straight through her,  apparently intent on settling in her groin and promptly jumped off of  the bed, pacing around agitatedly as she pulled down her shirt.</p>

<p>"You can't.  I'm mean you can't just do and…and…and…and do …THAT…and… and …and…and," Katie began in a flustered voice not able to say  anything coherent, as those feeling kept shooting through her body  making thought very, very difficult.  </p>

<p>"I thought you liked it," Jessie said softly, not quite sure what to  make of Katie's response, and wishing she hadn't done anything  because of it.</p>

<p>"I did, I do," Katie said walking back over to the bed realizing that  she was freaking Jessie out.  "I like it a lot, too much.  Definitely  too much.  Like I really liked it…like liked it a lot," she went on  both wanting to think about how much she liked it, and fearing that  thinking about liking it would get her all worked up again now that  she was just starting to calm down.</p>

<p>"Then why did you … you know, run away?" Jessie asked wanting to  believe Katie, but having insecurities jump up in her face making it  harder than it should've been to actually accept what she was saying.</p>

<p>"Because," Katie said standing up again and pacing once  more.  "Because touching like that leads to stuff … naked stuff.   Naked … sweaty stuff," she continued her voice lowering slowly as she  spoke.  "Naked sweaty stuff on the bed…"</p>

<p>"I get it," Jessie interrupted blushing as images of what Katie was  describing came to her, making her shift suddenly feeling a bit warm.</p>

<p>"Yeah, so," Katie responded snapping out of it and carefully lying  back down on the bed.  "This way, the no stuff way … is good," she  continued as her head came to rest against the pillow.  Jessie nodded  tentatively shifting back towards Katie, then snuggling in once more  when her girlfriend made no effort to move.</p>

<p>"Do you not want," Jessie started a moment later, "to do stuff.  With  me?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," Katie replied wondering immediately if she  should've taken a moment to make sure she didn't sound like an  undersexed 14-year-old boy looking at his Seven of Nine poster.  "I  just…I mean, I didn't know if you wanted to yet, and I didn't want to  make it seem like, well you know, make you feel like just because I  wanted to, you had to want to … too.  Because I don't want anything…"</p>

<p>"That I don't want," Jessie finished for her lifting her head to look  at Katie.  "I wasn't trying to get you worked up," she continued a  moment later.   "I just … sometimes I just get this need to touch you  and …"</p>

<p>"It's okay," Katie said interrupting her, knowing that Jessie wasn't  ready to go any farther yet.  It was fine with her; she probably  really wasn't ready for it either, hormones were just tricky  bastards.  "You're not ready, that's fine."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed in response to Katie's statement and rolled away from  her flipping onto her back on the other side of the bed.  She knew  that Katie was ready to move on to the next step, that sometimes when  they were together Katie literally had to stop herself from touching  Jessie to keep things under control.  And she wanted to be ready to  move on too, she'd thought about it, taking things to the next step,  but she just knew that she wasn't ready to do more than think about  it and that upset her because she knew that she couldn't give Katie  something she wanted, maybe even needed.  </p>

<p>"On TV everyone always says its alright, but then you always find  them making out in the janitors closet with some hoochie who *will*  give it up," Jessie moaned closing her eyes dejectedly, thinking that  this is what you get for dating a stupid sophomore.  </p>

<p>Katie rolled over so that she was leaning over Jessie with her arms  braced on the sides of the girl's body, and looked up at her very  seriously and said, "that's not going to happen.  They lock the  janitor's closets at our school."  </p>

<p>Jessie looked down at her face and couldn't help but smile at the  expression Katie was wearing before she turned her head away self- consciously.  </p>

<p>"Seriously though.  That's not gonna happen.  I love you.  And even  though everyone on TV might be a lying bastard, I'm not.  You're the  only girl for me," Katie continued with absolute seriousness this  time.  Jessie looked down at Katie meeting her gaze for a few moments  after this, the eye contact between them only breaking when Katie  leaned up and kissed her softly.  </p>

<p>Her girlfriend then rolled off of her on back onto her side of the  bed.  "So um, we probably shouldn't watch `Bound' next."</p>
