<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 3: Chancetown -->

<p>Rebecca's knuckles were white from holding on to the saddle horn.
		Josie pulled up the reins the instant she saw the first signs of civilization. Wordlessly,
		she dismounted and waited for the young woman to get off her horse so she could be on her
		way. It took a moment for Rebecca to disengage her fingers from the horn and dismount.
		Josie climbed back into the saddle.</p>

		<p>"Wait, you're not going to leave me here all alone, are
		you?"</p>

		<p>"Chancetown is right over there." Josie nudged Phoenix
		and took off, leaving the blonde woman standing there. Rebecca turned and headed home; not
		as excited as she should have been, although not really knowing why.</p>

		<p>As Rebecca walked through the main street in town, she could not
		help but notice that several people stopped and blatantly gawked at her. The wife of the
		man who ran the feed and grain store recognized the girl, and draping a horse blanket over
		her shoulders, she escorted the shaken young woman to the doctor's office. The doctor sent
		his son to tell Rebecca's family that she was in town. While waiting for the doctor to
		examine her, she got a look at herself in a mirror, and she understood why everyone was so
		worried. She was a mess. Her dress was completely ruined from the outlaw's knife, and
		stained by the men's blood. Her hair was loosely scattered about her head, with bits of
		grass and dirt tangled up in it. It took vigorous protesting by Rebecca to convince the
		doctor that she wasn't in need of a personal examination. The sheriff arrived at the same
		time as her parents. Her mother took one look at the torn dress and burst into tears. Her
		father scowled at her.</p>

		<p>"How could you let something like this happen to you!"
		He roared as he stepped closer to her, his hand upraised. Sheriff Wellman stepped between
		them.</p>

		<p>"Now, just hold on there, Caleb. We don't know what happened
		yet. No sense beating the girl for something she ain't done yet." The beefy sheriff
		waited until the angry man lowered his hand before turning to look at Rebecca, who was
		being held in a death-lock hug by her mother. "Girl, what happened?" He asked.</p>

		<p>It took a moment for Rebecca to get Sarah to release her. "I
		was out in the fields when three men in a wagon stopped and asked if I could tell them how
		to get to Chancetown. While I was telling one of them, the other two came up from behind
		and grabbed me. They threw me into the wagon and took off. I..." She was cut off by
		her father's angry voice.</p>

		<p>"And you let them?" He growled as he took a step
		forward. The sheriff turned his head and gave Caleb a warning glare.</p>

		<p>"I didn't let them!" Rebecca cried. "I tried to
		get away from them but there were three of them, and..."</p>

		<p>"Did they hurt you, child?" Sarah asked her daughter,
		with genuine concern in her voice.</p>

		<p>"No. They were going to but I was rescued."</p>

		<p>"Rescued?" Her father asked incredulously. "And
		just who'd be the one that rescued you?"</p>

		<p>"Josie Hunt..." She started to say the outlaw's full
		name, but stopped herself out of fear for what the gunslinger would do to her if she were
		caught because she told the sheriff she was in the area. Quickly she added, "I-I
		think that's what she said her name was. I was so upset I might have mis-heard."</p>

		<p>"You trying to say Josie Hunter saved you?" Caleb said
		angrily. "Drag me out of the fields for this nonsense!" He glared at his wife.
		"This is all your fault for letting her daydream all the time and read those books.
		Nothin' good ever came from reading no books. She should be learning how to be some man's
		wife 'stead of all the time havin' her nose buried in some damn book."</p>

		<p>"But Daddy, I-" A strong slap across the face silenced
		her. Sarah cried out, but made no effort to stop him.</p>

		<p>"You always did talk too much fer yer own good, girl. Look
		at you!" He looked at her disheveled hair and clothes. "Why, you ain't much
		better than them bitches and whores over to the saloon." He grabbed Rebecca by the
		upper arm, squeezing it painfully. "You git yourself out to the wagon right now,
		girl! You hear me?"</p>

		<p>"Y-yes, you're hurting me." She cried as his fingers
		tightened. Sarah knew better than to interfere. She stepped back a few feet and silently
		prayed that he wouldn't beat her in front of the sheriff.</p>

		<p>"You ain't seen hurt like yer gonna see it when I git you
		back home", he hissed under his breath so only Rebecca could hear him. Visions of her
		father's ideas of punishment flashed through her mind. She started to shake her head back
		and forth.</p>

		<p>"No, daddy, please. I didn't do anything wrong."</p>

		<p>"You're lying, girl! Makin' up stories 'bout that outlaw
		rescuing you. Why, even I know that murderin' bitch died a while back with her gang.
		'Sides, she's purely evil; ain't no way she'd risk her own neck to go and save your
		worthless hide." He smacked her once more before dragging her out to their wagon and
		roughly pushing her into the back. He didn't bother to help Sarah up. Sheriff Wellman came
		over and silently assisted her. Caleb climbed up on his side and grabbed the reins,
		unmindful of his daughter's tears.</p>

		<p>Sheriff Wellman watched them drive away. His eyes locked on the
		sad green eyes in the back of the wagon. Doctor Thompson stood next to him.</p>

		<p>"Think she's tellin' the truth?" The sheriff asked.</p>

		<p>"Hard to say. But if she is, she'd be better off with the
		outlaw than her father right now." Dr. Thompson decided not to mention the numerous
		faded bruises he saw when he examined her.</p>

		<p>"You may very well be right about that, Doc." The
		Sheriff knew all too well just how violent Caleb's temper was. He'd pulled the man out of
		enough barroom brawls over the years to know just how badly alcohol affected the farmer.
		It was obvious now that Caleb had already started his daily drinking binge.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca lay awake, tears streaming down her face. She was in too
		much pain to sleep anyway. Upon arriving at the farm, her father had dragged her into the
		barn and beat her severely with a leather strap until in desperation she made up a story
		that he believed. She told him that she had met up with a young man from town, who tried
		to have his way with her. When she refused, the boy slapped her around and left her miles
		from home. She said she tore her dress on barbed wire while crawling under a fence. He
		smiled and accepted that story, giving her a fresh beating for lying about the outlaw and
		the men, and another series of lashes for running away in the first place. Only when his
		massive arm ached from raising the strap did he finally drop the leather and leave the
		barn. Rebecca slumped to the earthen floor, the last sound she heard was him cursing her
		as he headed to the house. Only when she was certain that he'd drunk himself into a stupor
		did she dare leave the barn and enter the house. Her sister Kate and her mother helped her
		get cleaned up and put ointment on the multitude of lashes and cuts on her back and legs.
		Her thin dress and corset did nothing to ease the severity of the blows from the strap.
		Her mother had long ago run out of words to comfort her oldest daughter. For some reason,
		Caleb visited his wrath on Rebecca more than on any of his other women. Sarah suspected it
		was because no matter how much he beat her, he could not break Rebecca's spirit.</p>

		<p>Now lying in bed, her body in agony, Rebecca wondered just why
		she had bothered to return. She tried to roll over and winced in pain as her thin
		nightshirt rubbed against her tender skin. A loud crash downstairs told her that her
		father was now awake from his drunken slumber. Fear of another beating gripped her. This
		was no way to live, she thought. As he lumbered up the stairs, Rebecca heard him mumbling
		about his troublesome daughter and how he could only hope that "this damn
		foolishness" did not ruin her chances of finding a husband.</p>

		<p>Rebecca waited until she heard the snores coming from her
		parent's room before climbing out of her bed. She walked carefully around the floorboards
		that she knew creaked to avoid waking Kate, who was sleeping soundly on the other side of
		the room. Pulling one peasant dress from the pile of dirty clothes and grabbing her shoes,
		she quietly left their room and headed downstairs. After dressing quickly, she found a pen
		and ink and wrote a short note telling her mother and sister that she loved them and would
		send word soon.</p>

		<p>Once away from the farm, Rebecca realized that she had no idea
		which direction to take. Other than the farm, Chancetown was really the only place she
		knew. Without consciously thinking of where she was going, she found herself walking down
		the main street of town. Sheriff Wellman stepped out of the saloon at the same moment she
		walked by.</p>

		<p>"Hold up, girl. Where you goin'?" Rebecca looked at him
		fearfully. Her eyes reminded the lawman of a frightened deer.</p>

		<p>"I-I..." She wasn't sure what to say to him.
		"Please don't say anything." She finally asked fearfully.</p>

		<p>"Come here." He gently grabbed her arm, mentally
		cursing himself as he watched her flinch. Letting go he motioned for her to follow him
		over to the jail.</p>

		<p>"No, please...I can't go back...please." She begged.</p>

		<p>"Quiet down, child." He said softly as he opened the
		door to the jailhouse. Lighting a lantern, he motioned for her to sit down in a nearby
		chair as he walked behind a desk and sat down. "Do you have any money?"</p>

		<p>"No." He reached into a drawer and pulled out a small
		strongbox. Opening it, he pulled out two dollars and handed them to her. "I know it's
		only sixteen bits, but you can't go out there with nothing."</p>

		<p>She took the money and stuffed it in her boot. "I don't know
		how to thank you." Rebecca began. The Sheriff cut her off with a wave of his hand.</p>

		<p>"Don't thank me, child. I know your father. I should have
		stopped him a long time ago. You better get going before the sun comes up and he discovers
		you missing." Rebecca stood up to leave. "Where you goin' anyway?"</p>

		<p>"West." She said as she opened the door.</p>
