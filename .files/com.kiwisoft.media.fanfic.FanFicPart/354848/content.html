<!-- World Without Love \ Part 10 -->

<p>"Red alert. All Hands to battle stations," Captain Janeway's voice accompanied by the sounds of the red alert klaxons woke Seven of Nine up. A bit disoriented at first, she quickly remembered her whereabouts when one frightened bundle of child came flying into her arms.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what's that?" the frightened child asked her friend.</p>

		<p>"You know that Naomi, it's the red alert, I have to get to Engineering." The half-Ktarian seemed even more in fear.</p>

		<p>"Don't leave me alone Seven, please."</p>

		<p>Seven did not know what to do, she had to get to her battle station, but she couldn't leave her charge alone and Neelix, with whom Naomi normally would stay in such situation, was not available. So she did the only thing left as an option.</p>

		<p>"Come with me, Naomi, but stay out of the way will you?"</p>

		<p>The child nodded.</p>

		<p>Having slept in her clothes the Borg didn't need to change and so proceeded directly to Engineering. It only now occurred to her that she didn't feel any impacts on the ship or the ship rocking or, for that matter, any other sign of a battle. So why had Janeway called them to battle stations? In her hurry to get to Engineering and still keeping an eye on Naomi, she quickly dismissed that thought. The captain would have her reasons. Feeling Naomi's pleading eyes on her as they headed down to Engineering, she picked up the child trying to reassure her and to take a bit of the fear off her little shoulders.</p>

		<p>That was how they arrived in Engineering. Immediately upon entering Voyager's heart she felt the ship rocking and shivering, apparently under enemy fire. She went to her station, sat Naomi down and told her to stay quiet.</p>

		<p>Everywhere in Engineering personnel were running around seemingly doing repairs but nobody seemed to have any idea of what was going on. Seven's logical Borg mind told her to get information about what was happening so she could help more efficiently. Since there was no way to contact the bridge, communication systems had failed, she had to go through the readings herself. A task that would have been easy enough had the computer been working correctly. But ......</p>

		<p>"Seven!" That shout came from the half-Klingon chief engineer, who had only now discovered that the Borg was present in Engineering. The mere mention of her name by B'Elanna made Seven's earlier emotions come back to her, threatening to overwhelm her. Only then did she notice the tone of B'Elanna's voice. Pressed and urgent. Seven turned around trying to see where the shout had come from. There she was. B'Elanna was leaning over a console in front of the warp core furiously hitting buttons.</p>

		<p>"The warp core's going to breach, come over here, we need to readjust the magnetic field constrictors," the half-Klingon shouted trying to make herself heard over the high level of noise present in the engine room. Without really thinking about it Seven turned to help her.</p>

		<p>'Her what? Friend? Love? No time to think about that now.'</p>

		<p>Naomi however had time to think, and followed Seven even though she was told to stay at the station.</p>

		<p>"Why is there no computer warning Seven?" The fear in her voice was quite obvious even to someone as unacquainted with emotions as Seven.</p>

		<p>"What is the child doing here?" the angry voice of the chief engineer asked, but continued to give Seven instructions as they worked together furiously to readjust the magnetic field constrictors.</p>

		<p>Seven went to the console at the other side of the warp core to adjust another constrictor, not all were accessible from the console B'Elanna was working on. Naomi's little form followed her. Reading the display on the console she proceeded to do the work that needed to be done, when a reading sent an expression of shock to her face.</p>

		<p>"There is an energy loop forming, plasma relays are going to fail, LANNA GET AWAY FROM YOUR CONSOLE, IT'S GOING TO ...."</p>

		<p>Seven didn't get the chance to complete her shouted warning as B'Elanna's console exploded right in the half-Klingon's face. Just then everything came miraculously back online again. The warp core that they just had been fighting to keep online was now just fine. Seven however didn't notice the change in the situation as her glance was fixed on the figure lying next to the warp core console. She was frozen in her place, only Naomi's scared voice asking: "Is she alive?" shook her out of her shock. Not hesitating Seven ran to her love - no question there now - and checked for life signs. There were none. At that moment the doctor arrived.</p>

		<p>He ignored Seven, who sat next to the Lieutenant whispering unbelievingly "she is dead, she can't be dead, she can't be. I never told her", and kneeled on the other side of the lifeless chief engineer.</p>

		<p>The medical tricorder in his hand made beeping noises as he scanned her hurriedly. His face took on a fallen expression. He could do nothing for the half-Klingon. Looking up from the now officially dead form of B'Elanna Torres to be greeted by the sight of a crying Seven of Nine, he reached out to touch her on her shoulder trying to console her.</p>

		<p>Suddenly Seven sat upright in her bed. Fear covering her features like a mask. Touching the wetness on her face she recognized that she had cried. She never cried, never. Borg don't cry, humans cry, humans are inefficient. And then it hit her. With all force her dream, or, to be more precise, her nightmare came back to her. The ship being attacked, taking Naomi with her to Engineering. B'Elanna. B'Elanna had died. Unable to stay put in her bed, she got up thinking about the nightmare she had had. Trying to reassure herself that everything was okay, she silently went into Naomi's room and checked on her young charge. She was sleeping peacefully in her bed her stuffed Flotter firmly pressed against her little form. With a sense of relief Seven retreated from the child's room. Her restlessness however wouldn't leave her. She needed to do it, just to prove it to herself. So she did it, giving in to her, as she viewed them, petty human cravings.</p>

		<p>"Computer, where is Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres?"</p>

		<p>The computer gave the answer dutifully. "Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres is in her quarters."</p>

		<p>Seven however was not satisfied yet. "Computer, state the medical status of Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres."</p>

		<p>And yet again the computer replied. "All medical readings concerning Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres are within acceptable ranges for Human-Klingon hybrids."</p>

		<p>Only now was Seven satisfied that her friend was safe. No, not friend, love. And if she died now, she would never know. Silently making a decision, Seven sat down to form plans to achieve her ultimate goal. Making B'Elanna Torres see that she was loved by her and making her return that love. Time for research.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Having spent the night thrashing in her bed, not really getting any rest B'Elanna got up to begin her morning routine. Sonic shower, hair, uniform. Being finished with that the half Klingon decided to stay in her quarters for breakfast. She really didn't want to take the chance of bumping into Seven, remembering, all too well, running away the previous afternoon.</p>

		<p>She didn't really know what had driven her to run. Seven had just made a move she herself had been to frightened to make and she had panicked, probably giving up her one and only chance to tell Seven that she was in love with her. And she was. Contemplating the incident she really had no idea why she had acted as she had.</p>

		<p>She ordered three banana pancakes from the replicator and carried her plate to the table in the living room of her quarters. While sitting down the computer announced, "There is an urgent message for you."</p>

		<p>Not able to figure out what might be urgent, but not urgent enough that she be called on her communicator, B'Elanna got up from her chair. Leaving the pancakes behind, she went to her work station to find out what kind of message this was.</p>

		<p>The name in the sender line, made B'Elanna's heart beat with anxiousness. Seven. What did she want that she couldn't tell her personally? Perhaps she didn't want to speak to her because of B'Elanna's cowardly behaviour yesterday. To stop contemplations that were leading to nowhere, the anxious half-Klingon finally hit the button to open the message and was completely caught off-guard when instead of the expected text displayed on the screen of the work station, a tune began to play. After a few seconds a voice began to sing lyrics.</p>

		<p>I haven't slept at all in days<br>
		It's been so long since we have talked<br>
		And I have been here many times<br>
		I just don't know what I'm doing wrong</p>

		<p>It was Seven. B'Elanna had least expected this from her friend, her love. (Even though Seven didn't know the fiery half Klingon loved her.) Fully concentrating on the voice that was carrying the tune of the song so wonderfully, the Klingon nearly missed the words she was singing. Nearly.</p>

		<p>What can I do to make you love me<br>
		What can I do to make you care<br>
		What can I say to make you feel this<br>
		What can I do to get you there</p>

		<p>Were those questions meant for her? Was Seven asking B'Elanna to love her? B'Elanna didn't know what to do. She did love Seven and perhaps there was a chance that the former Borg would forgive her for running away like that yesterday. When she cared enough to send this song there was a chance, wasn't there?</p>

		<p>There's only so much I can take<br>
		And I just got to let it go<br>
		And who knows I might feel better<br>
		If I don't try and I don't hope</p>

		<p>Seven's singing voice reminded B'Elanna of the day, not so long ago, when she had heard the ex-Borg sing for the first time. Having got to know Seven, the real Seven and not the mask she put on for the crew, in the time between now and then, B'Elanna was no longer surprised to hear emotions in Seven's voice and there were emotions in Seven's voice.</p>

		<p>What can I do to make you love me<br>
		What can I do to make you care<br>
		What can I say to make you feel this<br>
		What can I do to get you there</p>

		<p>'Does she love me? She only said she's attracted to me.'</p>

		<p>No more waiting, no more aching<br>
		No more fighting, no more trying...</p>

		<p>B'Elanna decided to just go ahead and tell Seven that she loved her, if the song was any indication Seven would reciprocate the feelings, that was at least what B'Elanna hoped.</p>

		<p>Maybe there's nothing more to say<br>
		And in a funny way I'm calm<br>
		Because the power is not mine<br>
		I'm just going to let it fly...</p>

		<p>Just how was she going to do that? This was more difficult than declaring her 'love' for Tom. Here was far more at stake. Her hearts, her soul. Seven.</p>

		<p>What can I do to make you love me<br>
		What can I do to make you care<br>
		What can I say to make you feel this<br>
		What can I do to get you there</p>

		<p>Love me...</p>

		<p>"I love you!" B'Elanna whispered under her breath. "I am so sorry." Her breakfast long forgotten, B'Elanna stormed out of her quarters to find Seven and apologize for her behaviour and tell her she loved her. On her way to the Wildman family quarters, B'Elanna knew that Seven was taking care of Naomi while Samantha and Neelix were away, the determined half-Klingon suddenly bumped into another person. Tom. 'Just great. No time for this now.'</p>

		<p>Having said, "Sorry Tom," she wanted to proceed to her destination, but was held up by a cheerful Tom catching her arm.</p>

		<p>"Hey, what's the hurry? No time to chat with an old friend?" he asked and continued, "I was on my way to you, thought we could have breakfast."</p>

		<p>Patience running low in B'Elanna this particular morning, she interrupted her ex.</p>

		<p>"Tom, I really have no time for this now. Bye." And with that she pulled her arm out of his grip and continued her way, leaving an open mouthed Tom behind.</p>

		<p>'There must be something important, perhaps something with Seven,' the pilot thought.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>'Now what are you going to do? Stand here all day?' a voice in B'Elanna's head asked. The chief Engineer was standing in front of the door to the Wildman family quarters. She was suddenly very nervous and didn't know, what to do. Making a decision and putting it into practice are very different things.</p>

		<p>"Senior officers to the briefing room," came Janeway's voice out of B'Elanna's communicator.</p>

		<p>Saved by the captain, so to speak.</p>

		<p>So B'Elanna turned and headed for the nearest turbo lift with mixed feelings. Relieved that she didn't have to speak to Seven right at that moment, and, at the same time, disappointed at being prevented from declaring her love to Seven.</p>

		<p>Seven. Only now did B'Elanna remember, that Seven was usually present at senior officers meetings, even though she wasn't Starfleet. She was about to face the woman she loved and that woman didn't even know of her feelings. B'Elanna just hoped she could take it.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>When Seven arrived in the briefing room, all the others were already present. She was late because she had to find someone to take care of Naomi. Sitting down in the only available chair (right next to Tom Paris to her dismay) she looked around hoping she would catch a glance of B'Elanna that could tell her how the half-Klingon had taken her 'message'.</p>

		<p>There she was. The half Klingon was sitting next to Captain Janeway, a seat that normally would have been occupied by Chakotay, except the Commander was out in charge of one of the supply missions and not present. B'Elanna's glance seemed to be glued to the table, and she wouldn't look up except when Janeway began talking to the assembled command crew.</p>

		<p>"I guess you're wondering, why I called this sudden meeting." All around the table heads were nodding. Except for Tuvok of course, who was his normal indifferent Vulcan self.</p>

		<p>"Well, this time it's not bad news."</p>

		<p>"That would be a first," Tom Paris gave one of his oh so famous unproductive comments. Though in his defence it had to be said that he was only trying to lighten the mood.</p>

		<p>The captain graciously ignored the remark and got back to what she was saying. "Supply team one has found a huge amount of food and dilithium on one of the planets found by Seven's search."</p>

		<p>They hadn't been sure as to the amount of dilithium the planet was harbouring, because of the nature of dilithium, the scanners could only indicate its presence not its amount.</p>

		<p>"Which one of the planets was that?" Seven asked, not knowing to which planets the respective teams had been assigned.</p>

		<p>Janeway looked a bit surprised. Why should Seven been interested in on which planet the dilithium has been found?</p>

		<p>"PXX345," she answered, "I have ordered the other teams back since they've come up with nothing, and when they're here, we head towards PXX345."</p>

		<p>Janeway looked around the table and then proceeded to give her orders.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I want you to start looking for ways to refine and store the dilithium we'll be digging up. Tom, you'll be assigned to the doctor for our stay here, with Voyager, orbiting a planet there's not much you can do. Tuvok, I want you to assemble security teams of one to two members who will accompany the digging and food teams. Mr Kim you'll be in charge of the main digging team, since you're well acquainted with dilithium. Seven you'll head up another team."</p>

		<p>"Captain, if you don't mind I think I would be more useful here on the ship, helping Lieutenant Torres."</p>

		<p>Janeway gave Seven a surprised glance. It did not happen very often now, that Seven refused an order. The captain thought it might have something to do with Seven's feelings for B'Elanna, but then the Lieutenant seemed equally surprised by Seven's 'suggestion'. And the former Borg drone never let feelings mess up her good judgement and would never do a thing to hinder the efficiency of Voyager.</p>

		<p>"Captain, Seven is right, I need her here more than she would be needed on the planet." When B'Elanna spoke up, Seven was surprised that she had spoken in her favour. In the course of the meeting Seven had gathered from the half-Klingons behaviour, that she had gotten the message and was not delighted by it.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna herself had no idea why she had said something in the first place. Working together with Seven when the air wasn't cleared yet would not be an easy thing to do, but Seven was needed on board Voyager, because, face it, she is a good engineer, and not only because of her Borg knowledge.</p>

		<p>The captain seemed to think about the suggestion of her Astrometrics officer and her chief engineer,</p>

		<p>"Okay, Seven you will be assigned to engineering, that's all then - " Janeway tried to conclude the meeting, but was interrupted when once again Seven spoke up.</p>

		<p>"Captain, the scans of the planet indicated that it has a nature and climate comparable to earth's, may I suggest that we land Voyager and have some shore leave?"</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine suggesting taking some time off? Wasn't that inefficient? But she was right the crew did need some time off, especially since it had been quite some time since the last shore leave they had been granted. And Voyager did not often happen to discover a planet that was uninhabited, resourceful and had a breathable atmosphere. All in all it seemed to be a pretty sound idea.</p>

		<p>"Okay, as soon as all supplies we need have been taken aboard, the whole crew will be granted shore leave. I will have Commander Chakotay work out a vacation plan," the captain finally agreed and then after looking around she gave them a nod and added, "You're dismissed."</p>
