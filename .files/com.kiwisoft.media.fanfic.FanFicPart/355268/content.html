<!-- Telling Series \ Section 5: Nicole - Catharsis -->

<p>"I'm not gonna tell her, you tell her." </p>
<p>"Me? She's your friend, not mine." </p>
<p>"Oh, no, that's the coward's way out, Sam. No fair using
that," Brooke informed her squirming girlfriend. "Hold still will you, I'm
almost done." </p>
<p>"You said that ten minutes ago, Brooke. Besides, she IS your
friend, or at least was until that whole `I'm going to run you down with my car'
thing," Sam shifted slightly, making the bathwater splash. "Oops, sorry. Anyway,
now you barely tolerate her. But that's no reason to send me into the lion's
den. I AM the one she ran down after all." Sam didn't miss the flash of regret
and pain that flew across Brooke's hazel eyes before she could mask it. And had
she not been in a slippery tub with her girlfriend, she would have kicked
herself for the comment. </p>
<p>"Brooke," Sam said softly from across the tub, "You're either
going to have to deal with it, or let it go. Soon. It happened. Nothing you or I
can do is going to change it." Brooke dropped her gaze from Sam's and looked
into bubbles surrounding them. </p>
<p>"Sam, please," she begged quietly. Sam wagged her toes in
Brooke's face. </p>
<p>"Hey, leg needs finishing shaving here," she said indicating
the calf Brooke currently was holding. "Or are you going to slit my ankle with
that Lady Bic?" Brooke glared at her and Sam went back to the subject at hand. </p>
<p>"Look, love," she started patiently as Brooke took another
light swipe at the back of her calf. It tickled and she had to surpress a small
giggle. She was, after all, trying to be serious for a change. "It's been months
and aside from a barely noticable limp and some faded scars, it's over and done
with. Why can't you let it go?" Brooke shrugged while she concentrated on one of
those scars Sam was talking about on Sam's right ankle. She knew every inch of
Sam's body intimately now and while she tried not to think about it often, the
scars were a roadmap of memories chronicling every moment of that awful night
and how far Sam had come as well as how much pain Sam had been through.
</p>
<p>"I try to, Sammy," she answered finally. "But every now and
then, when I look at or think about Nicole, I see you in that hospital bed,
hooked up to those machines and the feelings come rushing back." Tears splashed
down from Brooke's face into the bathwater. Sam pulled her leg away and leaned
across the tub to hold the crying girl. </p>
<p>"Survivor's guilt's a bitch, I know," Sam said soothingly as
she stroked Brooke's damp hair out of her face. Brooke looked at her confused.
"I felt it for a long time after my Dad died. I was afraid to be happy because
he wasn't here. How could I be happy when he was dead? It didn't seem right, or
fair," Brooke listened intently to the important words Sam was telling her. </p>
<p>"And you feel it partially because you feel that that whole
night was your fault. I got hit by that car by pushing you out of the way. Some
silly part of your brain keeps telling you that it should have been you who
suffered. But it wasn't Brooke, it was me. And I have told you a hundred, a
million times that it wasn't your fault and I don't blame you. And I will tell
you a milion more if that's what it takes but please, please love, stop blaming
yourself or at least go easy. It's been eating you up inside off and on all this
time and I hate to watch you do this," Sam was crying now too. Brooke reached up
with sudsy hands and brushed the tears away. </p>
<p>"We're a pair aren't we?" Brooke asked though her tears as Sam
settled against her. Sam nodded. "OK, we'll both tell her, but no jokes about
running anyone over. Everytime you say it, I relive it." Sam swallowed the sob
of guilt that rushed up at the statement. </p>
<p>"OK," she managed to choke out past her guilt. If she were to
tell the truth, she couldn't close her eyes without seeing the damned thing
herself still. She still woke in a cold sweat sometimes although she was getting
better about not waking Brooke if she was there with her. </p>
<p>"You OK, Sam?" Brooke asked, worried at the sudden silence of
her tubmate. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Fine," Sam lied. Brooke gave her a dubious look. "We'd better
get out before we prune," she said to deflect the attention from herself. She
stood up and stepped out of the tub, holding out another towel for Brooke once
she was ready. She wrapped the towel around the taller frame and then proceeded
to dry the blonde's hair with another. Brooke purred at the attention.
</p>
<p>"So, your room or mine?" </p>
<p>"Brooke, `rentals," Sam reminded her. Brooke huffed at her. </p>
<p>"Are at the a reunion in Fresno all weekend. Mac is at a
babysitter's. You have a memory like a cheese grate, full of holes," Brooke
teased. Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"Keep that up and you'll be sleeping alone, Princess," she
threatened. Brooke pretended to look horrified. </p>
<p>"Eeeek, the horror!" she squealed, making Sam burst out
laughing. Sam finished drying Brooke's hair and pulled her into a burning kiss.
Brooke let go of the towel covering her body and let it fall to the floor. Sam
pulled out of the kiss and arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Is that an invitation?" Sam asked huskily as she drank in the
sight of Brooke. Brooke just nodded and reached out to pull at Sam's towel. Sam
stepped just out of reach and shook her head. "Ah, ah, ah?no naughty touchy for
Brookie just yet," she chided. Brooke stuck her bottom lip out in a pout.
</p>
<p>"Oh no you don't. Even the sexy pout isn't going to work this
time," Sam wagged her finger at Brooke. </p>
<p>"Why not?" Brooke almost whined. A wicked smile that made
Brooke's blood boil spread across Sam's face. </p>
<p>"My turn first," Sam said with a glint of teeth. Brooke smiled
back and happily followed Sam into her room. </p>

"I love you, you know," Brooke said after Sam opened her eyes and focused them
on her. Sam smiled at her lopsidedly. </p>
<p>"I love you too," she whispered, closing her eyes and leaning
in for a kiss. "I hope you understand how much," she continued as she brushed
some stray strands of blonde hair way from Brooke's eyes. </p>
<p>"I do," Brooke reassured her confidently. Sam grinned at her
widely. </p>
<p>"Just to be sure, let me show you." </p>

<p>** </p>

<p>Sam looked down at the blonde head resting on her bare chest
hours later and watched the hand that traced the light scars on her ribcage. She
sometimes wondered what Brooke thought about while she did that. (Do the scars
bother her? Is she thinking about the accident again?) </p>
<p>"Penny for `em, Princess," Sam whispered. Brooke shifted
slightly so that she could look in Sam's eyes but not have to lift her head. </p>
<p>"Just listening to your heartbeat," Brooke answered simply, a
hint of sadness and longing in her voice. Sam's eyes smiled although she frowned
slightly. </p>
<p>"Still there I trust?" Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"It's a very beautiful sound, Sammy. I was once so afraid that
it would stop," she trailed off, tears choking off her voice. Sam stroked
Brooke's hair with one hand and ran her other one down Brooke's back.
</p>
<p>"Takes a licking and keeps on ticking," Sam joked, needing to
lighten the mood before she lost control of her own emotions. Brooke shook her
head without lifting it, making her hair brush against Sam's chest and making
her shiver. </p>
<p>"You don't understand," Brooke looked away. "The thought of
telling Nic about us has made me rethink the whole accident thing. There were
nights in the hospital when the only sound I had for company was the beeping of
your heart monitor. And it scared me that you were reduced to a series of bleeps
and whistles. Did anyone tell you that that sound stopped? Twice?" Sam felt hot
tears burn the skin between her breasts as Brooke cried. </p>
<p>"No," she replied honestly, scared at the thought. That was
news to her. Brooke snuggled closer to her, if that was possible, still keeping
her ear pressed to Sam's heart. </p>
<p>"Your heart stopped twice, Sammy, and I thought I had lost you
forever without ever telling you how I really felt," Brooke continued, her voice
now nothing more than a raspy whisper. </p>
<p>"But it started again," Sam reminded her calmly. Brooke could
hear the way Sam's heart had sped up at hearing the news though and knew Sam
wasn't half as calm as she acted. </p>
<p>"Only after the doctors and nurses poked you with needles and
drugs and used those paddles on you. God, Sam, it was scary and nothing like you
see on TV. I thought you were dead," Brooke was sobbing now and Sam could do
nothing but hold on to her. </p>
<p>"Why didn't anyone tell me?" Sam asked after Brooke calmed
down some. Brooke shrugged, still not moving from her vigil over Sam's heart. </p>
<p>"It doesn't really fit into many conversations. `Welcome back
from your coma, Sam. You're paralyzed from the waist down, but it might be
temporary, you can't speak, also temporary, and oh yeah, you died twice. Nice
recovery'. You see how it lends itself to awkwardness? Besides, you did recover
and we figured the less you knew the better. But sometimes, when no one was
around, I'd crawl into your hospital bed and put my head on your chest just to
make sure." </p>
<p>"Like this?" Sam asked with a smile. Brooke nodded.
</p>
<p>"Like this," Brooke answered. "And then I could sleep again
knowing you were all right." Sam brushed away her own tears that had fallen. </p>
<p>"That's very sweet, Brooke. You took very good care of me.
Still do, actually." Brooke smiled at her, her eyes lighting up like blue
sapphires in the pale moonlight. </p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy. That means a lot. I tried so hard to take
good care of you," she yawned. "And I still want to keep you safe. That's why
I'm afraid to tell Nicole." </p>
<p>"Afraid she'll pull another jealous drunken bender number?"
Sam asked, not a hint of humor in her voice, only genuine concern. She was
worried Nicole might go ballistic on them too. Having Nic flip and target one of
them was not something she wanted to live through again. If she was lucky enough
to live through it again, that is. Besides, watching Harrison and Carmen freak
and shun them was enough. And there was still Mike to consider. Telling him was
no doubt going to be anything but fun. Brooke nodded and yawned again.
</p>
<p>"Yup," Brooke said quietly and Sam could tell she was drifting
off. Sam placed a small kiss on the top of Brooke's head and listened as her
breathing became deep and even. </p>
<p>"Sleep, Princess," Sam whispered to the sleeping form who was
still situated over her heart. "I'll keep you safe tonight." </p>
