<p>Sebastian was strumming away at his guitar, what else was new, he was concentrating on the beat till Viola came in and started shouting at him. In actual truth Viola wasn't shouting at him, she was attempting to have a conversation with her brother, but because he refused to put his guitar down and listen, she had had to increase the volume of the conversation. That wasn't actually a conversation because Sebastian wasn't responding.</p>
<p>"SEBASTIAN!", yelled Viola for what felt like the 10th time, she was getting fed up with her brother, she was here to help him with something that she didn't really want fixed.</p>
<p>From all this anger and frustration that Viola was now feeling towards her brother and his relationship with the girl she was meant to be with, she ripped the guitar out of its amplifier, and watched with amusement as Sebastian stared at her with horror.</p>
<p>"What the hell did you do that for?", he asked, jumping up to stick the guitar back in its amplifier.</p>
<p>"Take another step and I'll toast this baby", said Viola dangling the lead over the cup of water that was sitting next to it.</p>
<p>Sebastian froze at the threat and sat back down on his bean bag, he was in his dorm room, trying to enjoy the peace and tranquility of his music till super bitch had walked in. He looked up as she began to talk at him, faining interest he thought back to the last cords he had been playing.</p>
<p>"Sebastian we have to fix this, Olivia is sad, she's sad because you made her sad, you need to fix this, fix this relationship. If you can actually call it a relationship when you don't pull your own weight, all you need to do is...", Viola rambled, looking down at her brother, she saw him moving his hands over the cords of his guitar.</p>
<p>"Give me that", she snapped, ripping the guitar from his hands.</p>
<p>"What? I was listening", whined Sebastian.</p>
<p>"Really, well then maybe you can tell me why I'm wasting my time in trying to help you", said Viola sitting down to met Sebastian at eye level.</p>
<p>"Sebastian don't get me wrong, your my brother and I love you, but I am not doing this for you, I'm doing this for Olivia, she deserves better and for some messed up reason she wants you even when she could have...", Viola stopped before she revealed too much, she looked at Sebastian for once he was intently listening. Then standing she continued, as if nothing had been said, or almost said.</p>
<p>"Thats not the point, the point is she wants you, and if you want her your going to have to work, okay?" asked Viola looking at her brother intently, Sebastian didn't move.</p>
<p>"Sebastian did you get that?", she asked.</p>
<p>"Wow, I never knew that", said Sebastian still staring at his sister.</p>
<p>"Good I'm glad you get it, now..." Viola began till Sebastian cut her off.</p>
<p>"You have really brown eyes, I never noticed before but they are really brown", said Sebastian with a fondness.</p>
<p>"AHHHH you know what, let her dump your ass, YOU DONT DESERVE HER", screamed Viola, shoving the guitar into Sebastian as she stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>"Vi, come on I was kidding, come back", said Sebastian, laughing.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean it", he yelled after her, jumping up to stand in the doorway of his room.</p>
<p>Viola turned back to face him, she looked threateningly at him, but in fact her heart was braking, not only because her brother was being an ass, but because the girl she loved was with an ass.</p>
<p>"Olivia deserves better Sebastian, I hope you understand that", said Viola, tears coming to her eyes. She turned back, to conceal them and marched down the hall.</p>
<p>Sebastian sighed and leaned against the door frame, maybe Viola was right, Olivia did seem kind of pissed off, maybe she did deserve better. He sighed again and walked back into his room, plugging the guitar back into the amplifier, he found a little note next to the cup, he picked it up and read.</p>
<p><i>Sebastian, </i></p>
<p><i>These Lessons suck, you should be here not me. </i></p>
<p><i>Here's basically what we covered:</i></p>
<p><i>communication</i></p>
<p><i>relationship is to be shared, good and bad </i></p>
<p><i>Vi</i></p>
<p>There was something below, relationship that he couldn't make out, it looked like it had been scribbled out, something about intimate. He read over the list again and sat down to work out how he was going to use these points to win Olivia's heart again. He would get her back, even if she hadn't gone yet.</p>
<p>Viola was walking down the halls of the collage outwardly growling, yes growling, Sebastian had made her so mad she was growling as she walked back to her dorm room. As she passed the soccer field a familiar voice called out to her.</p>
<p>"Viola, hey Viola", yelled Duke from across the field, Viola didn't respond she just kept walking.</p>
<p>Running to catch up with her, Duke slowed to a walk.</p>
<p>"Yo Viola", said Duke.</p>
<p>Viola jumped, she been so caught up in her thoughts that she hadn't registered Duke's appearance, sighed as she looked over him, he was in his soccer training outfit.</p>
<p>"Oh hey Duke", she said still walking.</p>
<p>"You okay?", he asked, looking at her with concern.</p>
<p>"Yeah I'm fine, why do you ask?", she replied.</p>
<p>"Cause I could have sworn you were growling", said Duke looking around as they continued to walk.</p>
<p>"Oh that... well its just my brother and...", before she could finish Duke interjected.</p>
<p>"Olivia", he said, sighing.</p>
<p>"Yeah, how'd you know?", she asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Its the reason you... broke up with me remember", he said quietly, looking around to make sure no one heard.</p>
<p>Viola blushed, she'd been with Duke so long she hadn't been able to not tell him why she was dumping him. He was sweet and was a great boyfriend, but an even better best friend, they didn't work as a couple. Especially since Viola had feelings for Olivia, that were more powerful than those she used to have for Duke. He had taken it really well and they were still best friends.</p>
<p>"Come on I'll buy you a milkshake and you can tell me all about it", said Duke putting his arm around Viola, and escorting her too the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Viola smiled, Duke would drop anything for her, he truly was a great guy. Maybe everything would work out better, she would just have to wait and see.</p>
<p><b>Authors Note: Hope you liked it... Next chapter will Viola be comforted by Duke? Will Sebastian make a better boyfriend? Will Olivia finally accept her growing feelings or will she just take the easy route again? And what will the next class hold for our beloved heroins? Find out soon... but first read and review. Oh and I would just like to say, yes it is a trend of mine that Duke is sweet, I think he was great in the movie and I don't think that just because hes a guy, he can't be nice and such. So in all my she's the man fics, Duke is sweet and yes Sebastian sometimes has problems, but he might get better. Tell me what you think review... </b></p>
