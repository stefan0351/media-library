<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 17: Coming Back and Fixing-->

<p>Buffy snapped awake. Looking at her clock, she saw it was only 11:30. More then twelve hours before, she had left Faith’s apartment after the other slayer had effectively ended any hope of them playing on the same side again. Buffy was scared not only for herself, but for Faith too, because Buffy knew she had gone over the edge.</P>
<p>She also knew what Faith did was an accident, but that didn’t help her any. She was the one who pushed the man to Faith to stake, and she was just as responsible. Looking back on everything, she wished she had been more responsible. In the good, Buffy way. Over the last couple days she hadn’t been herself, and she knew that.</P>
<p>Faith allowed her a freedom she had never considered before. She went along with Faith’s advice to try and gain her trust, and really, to see what it felt like to let go. She found out all right. She had lost control, and a man had paid with his life. Worst of all, she alienated Willow, and she hated herself for it.</P>
<p><I>‘She was right. The whole time. Why did I do that to her?’</P>
</I><p>Willow wouldn’t have told her about Faith if she weren’t it sure it was the truth. She couldn’t imagine how she must have made her feel, to see her go to Faith all the time. </P>
<I><p>‘It hurt her a lot.’</P>
<p></I>Faith was a good excuse to get away from Willow, and if it hadn’t been her, it would’ve been something else. As soon as she saw the look on Willow’s face after she got acceptance letters from every college and university on the planet, Buffy immediately felt like she was going to hold her back. Like she was forcing Willow to stay with her, and denying the world her intelligence and her talent.</P>
<p>She didn’t want to condemn Willow to a life of monsters and death. She wanted to give her a life with no worries. But she couldn’t do that, so the best option to her was to maintain enough distance, so that Willow would eventually decide to move on. She wanted Willow to stay, wanted to be with her, but that was selfish. And being selfish led to being arrested, and then causing two cops to become unconscious.</P>
<p>When she wasn’t thinking about Willow, she was dreaming about the man. Propped up against the dumpster, looking at her though dead eyes. In the dream, the blood never stopped. It just kept coming, and she went under, submerged in an innocent’s blood, and she lost herself forever.</P>
<p>She got out of bed, and rubbed her face. The right thing to do was tell someone, tell Giles, Willow, but she couldn’t. For Faith’s sake. She kept asking herself why she wanted to protect her. Was it because they were slayers? That was part of it, and the other she soon figured out, was because Faith was human. And Buffy killed and hurt demons, not people. Besides, they weren’t going to find the body.</P>
<p>She heard the news on in her mom’s room, and walked just inside the doorway. Buffy went wide-eyed when she heard what they were talking about.</P>
<p>"We go now live to our field reporter, who is standing by at the waterfront with this breaking news about the murder that has shocked the Mayor and residents of Sunnydale." The anchor said.</P>
<p>On the screen it switched to footage from the waterfront earlier in the day. A boat was in the water retrieving Allan’s body.</P>
<P>"Fishermen discovered the body today, the victim of a brutal stabbing. Authorities and citizens alike were shocked when the slain man was identified as Deputy Mayor Allan Finch." The reporter said.</P>
<p><I>‘Oh God…he was…Oh God…’ </I>She started to feel sick.</P>
<P>"Still reeling from the news, Mayor Wilkins had this to say."</P>
<P>The footage switched to the Mayor at a press conference.</P>
<P>"Mr. Finch was not only my longtime aide and associate, he was a close personal friend. I promise you I will not rest until whoever did this is found and brought to justice. Thank you very much."</P>
<P>Joyce turned around, and saw Buffy standing there.</P>
<P>"Oh, honey, you're up. Oh, it's just terrible, isn't it?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy was sitting at the table in the library with Willow, Giles was sitting on the steps and Wesley was talking. </P>
<P>"I want you to look into this. Find out everything you can about the murder of the Deputy Mayor."</P>
<P>Buffy tried to hide the guilty look threatening to surface on her face. "It's amazing that you've learned nothing at all about me."</P>
<P>"I'm sorry?"</P>
<P>"Try asking nicely, an apology would be good too." Willow clarified.</P>
<P>"Oh. I apologize, I…it was a mistake, and it will never happen again. Could you please look into…"</P>
<P>"But that's…not really our jurisdiction, is it?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"She's right. The Deputy Mayor's murder was the result of human malice. There's nothing supernatural about it." Giles said.</P>
<P>"We don't know that for certain. I say it merits investigation."</P>
<P>"Which I'm sure the police are doing. Meantime, if you ask me, there are better uses for the Slayers' time."</P>
<P>"Ah. But I don't believe I did. Ask you."</P>
<P>"Considering the success of your previous adventure..."</P>
<P>"Do I have to lock you into your rooms?" Buffy asked. "Listen, Giles' opinion counts too. You want me to work with you, he's gotta be involved. Got it?"</P>
<P>"Fine. If you have time after your standard patrol, could you possibly check out the Mayor's records?"</P>
<P>"You want her to break into City Hall?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"Is that a problem?"</P>
<P>Buffy thought back to the alley. <I>'What was he doing there anyway?'</P>
</I><P>It was kind of weird that a deputy mayor would be in an alley in the middle of the night. That would be something. The city government involved in the Hellmouth. Actually, the more she thought about it, the more it made sense.</P>
<P>"No, I'll do it. I have…to get to…"</P>
<P>"Class." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Yeah, that's it."</P>
<P>Willow got up, and they both walked out of the library.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"You know something about it, don't you?" Willow asked Buffy on the way to class.</P>
<p>"No. Why would I?"</P>
<p>"I'm going with you tonight."</P>
<p>"Will…"</P>
<p>"If this has something to do with Faith, and it being too dangerous…"</P>
<p>"No…she's…"</P>
<p>"I'm going."</P>
<p>Willow looked at her, waiting for Buffy to challenge her statement, but it didn't come.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the Mayor's Office, he was destroying documents through a paper shredder. Trick was standing by watching, holding a folder.</P>
<p>"It's not working."</P>
<P>"It's supposed to do something besides shred?"</P>
<P>"It's supposed to cheer me up. Usually using the shredder gives me a lift. It's fun."</P>
<P>"And today you're not getting the ya-yas."</P>
<P>"No." The Mayor said sadly. "Guess it'll take more than this to turn my frown upside down. I just don't understand why Allan would leave such a paper trail about our dealings. Do you think he was gonna betray me? Oh, now, that's a horrible thought. And now he's dead, I'll never have the chance to scold him."</P>
<P>"Maybe this will change your mood."</P>
<P>Trick dropped a copy of the coroner's report on the desk. The Mayor picked it up and opened it.</P>
<P>"What is it?"</P>
<P>"Bombshell. The Deputy Mayor had wooden splinters in his wound. Struck right through the heart with a sharp, pointed object. Now, word is, someone was fighting vampires not a block away from the scene. Any smart money says it was a Slayer who did this job."</P>
<P>"Why? Do you think he talked?"</P>
<P>"He tried. Didn't get too far though." Faith said walking into the room.</P>
<P>The Mayor turned around and smiled at her.</P>
<P>"Faith! I hope the action was justified."</P>
<P>She couldn't let him know it was an accident. </P>

<I><P>'If he knew it was…' </I>She shuddered.</P>
<P>"Completely, boss. I'm sorry."</P>

<P>"Don't be. In every term of office there are gains and losses. This in no way implicates me. All it does is help. Relax." He walked up to her, and ran his hand across her cheek. "You did good."</P>
<P>"The cops will be all over this." Trick said.</P>
<P>"True, but I will deal with them. There are after all, two slayers in this town."</P>
<P>Faith and Trick grinned. </P>
<P>"Great idea, boss."</P>
<P>"Buffy Summers, is now up for Murder One. That's sunshine and roses to me. It really is."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later at night, Buffy and Willow snuck into Allan's office. Buffy switched on the light as Willow went over to one of the file drawers. She went over to his desk, and saw a picture of Allan and the Mayor shaking hands at a press conference. </P>
<p><I>'And I feel worse.'</P>
<p></I>She looked up as Willow called her over. Willow handed her a folder. It was empty.</P>
<p>"All his files are gone." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Do you think…?"</P>
<p>"I wouldn't have thought it, but don't you think it's kind of odd that all the records the Deputy Mayor kept are just gone?"</P>
<p>"Then how much do you wanna bet that's who…"</P>
<p>Buffy suddenly hushed as they both heard noises out in the hall. They went to the door, and cracked it open. The Mayor and Trick were talking and walking down the hall. Buffy quickly shut the door.</P>
<p>"That guy's a vampire."</P>
<p>"The Mayor?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"No the other one. I'm gonna follow them. See what else you can find."</P>
<p>"Be careful."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy crept out into the hall, and looked at the door that had just shut. She got halfway down, creeping along the wall, when she felt hands grab her and pull her into a room. She couldn't move, and she felt metal against her neck.</P>
<p>"I didn't think you'd be stupid enough to come here." Faith said.</P>
<p>"So, this is your boss's place, huh?"</P>
<p>"I work for the top guys. I won't settle for less."</P>
<p>"You gonna slit my throat or can I go?"</P>
<p>"No…I was gonna slit your throat."</P>
<p>Buffy stomped her foot on top of Faith's causing her to drop the knife right into Buffy's hands. She elbowed Faith in the stomach, and the other slayer staggered back.</P>
<p>"Come on, B. Use the knife."</P>
<p>"I aim to please."</P>
<p>Buffy threw the knife right above Faith's head, and it stuck into the wall.</P>
<p>"How'd I know you wouldn't do it?"</P>
<p>She rushed at Buffy, and they both fell to the ground. Faith was on top, and put her hands around Buffy's neck.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow grabbed the lamp off Allan's desk, and opened the door again. Buffy had been gone too long. She knew she should stay in the room, but she also knew something was wrong. Everything seemed okay, but in her experience, when something seemed okay, it usually wasn't.</P>
<p>She made up her mind when she heard a thump. She walked out, and shut the door behind her. As she walked past a couple more doors, she saw one was open. She peaked around the corner, and saw Faith choking Buffy.</P>
<p>She rushed in, and slammed the lamp over Faith's head. It shattered, and Faith let go off of Buffy's neck. She kicked her off, and back, hard into the wall. She flipped up into a standing position.</P>
<p>"Are you okay?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Yeah thanks."</P>
<p>"You brought your bitch, B?"</P>
<p>Rage swelled up inside Buffy, and she punched Faith right on the bridge of her nose. She started to bleed.</P>
<p>"You're close, still didn't go for the kill."</P>
<p>"Like you did?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>Faith had an evil smile on her face, and Willow stood in front of her.</P>
<p>"Buffy tried to protect you from murder charges. She's a lot nicer than I am. You may be able to kill me right now, but I just have to say that you had your shot. You could've had us as friends, but you decided to choose evil.</P>
<p>"Well, keep it. Eventually it's gonna come back to haunt you, and you'll wish you stayed with us. See you may have protection from murder, some power, but you don't have friends, and you don't have love. I pity you."</P>
<p>"We have to go." Buffy said smirking.</P>
<p>They turned around, and started to leave. Faith didn't move.</P>
<p>"The Mayor's got this town wired. He built it for demons to feed on. You may have love, but it ain't gonna last. Come graduation day, you'll be dead. And I wouldn't be surprised if you had some people waiting for you at home, B."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow and Buffy were sitting in Willow's room. Buffy was reluctant to go home.</P>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"I don't know. I was scared, I guess."</P>
<p>"Of me?"</P>
<p>"For you. The more I pull you in, the less likely it is that you'll be able to get out."</P>
<p>"Who said I wanted to get out?"</P>
<p>"Why wouldn't you? I've been really messed up, I helped kill a guy…"</P>
<p>"You didn't do anything. You didn't put a stake in his heart. You have to tell Giles."</P>
<p>"I know I do. Faith is gone, and I'll have to deal with her."</P>
<p>"We'll have to deal."</P>
<p>"Will, you have a great opportunity to do something with your life, and I don't want you to feel…"</P>
<p>"I know I have a great opportunity. When we were facing off with Faith, things just, kind of, got clear. I mean, you've been fighting evil here for three years, and I've helped some, and now we're supposed to decide what we want to do with our lives. </P>
<P>"And I just realized that that's what I want to do. Fight evil, help people. I mean, I-I think it's worth doing. And I don't think you do it because you have to. It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in."</P>
<P>"I kind of love you."</P>
<P>"Kind of?"</P>
<P>"Really love you."</P>
<P>"I was beginning to think…"</P>
<P>"I know. I was trying…actually; right now I can't remember what I was trying to do. I guess I never realized that you helped cause you wanted to do. I had always thought you did it cause you thought I was making you. And I wanted to let you have the life, I thought you wanted."</P>
<P>"I want this life."</P>
<P>"I know that now." Buffy kissed Willow. "And I'm glad you do. I couldn't do this without you."</P>
<P>"I'm never leaving, okay? Never."</P>
<P>"Same here. And if I ever don't act like me again…"</P>
<P>"I'll get you out of it." Willow kissed her.</P>
<P>"As much as I'd like to find out how, I should get home."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy got home, and was greeted by her mom, and a police officer. He wanted to question her about something, and she knew what it was.</P>
<P>"What time did you get home last night?"</P>
<P>"Late. Um, a little past 1:00, I guess."</P>
<P>"Maybe you can explain to me what a girl your age is doing out all night."</P>
<P>"I was at a friend's…watching TV."</P>
<P>"Hmm. That's funny 'cause I got a couple of witnesses who put you near the alley."</P>
<P>"Witnesses?"</P>
<P>"A murder happened there last night."</P>
<P>"Yeah, I heard about it on the news."</P>
<P>"Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart. Strange thing is, the weapon, it was made out of wood. Any of this mean anything to you?"</P>
<P>"Sorry, no. Is that it? I'm kinda beat."</P>
<P>"Yeah, I have enough for now. Buffy, if you know something, if you're protecting someone, I promise you it'll be better for everyone if you just come clean."</P>
<P>"I wish I could help you."</P>
<P>"Well, call me if you remember anything."
</P>
<hr width=100>

<P>"The Slayer, and her friend. Right here in the building." The Mayor said to Trick and Faith lo oking at the security camera tapes.</P>
<P>"There was supposed to be a guard."</P>
<P>"Here comes my favorite part. They see us in the hall together, thick as thieves. Oh, wait, we are thieves. And worse. And now they know it."</P>
<P>"Well, they're not gonna be much of a threat in jail."</P>
<P>"Well, we don't have near enough evidence to put 'em away. And Faith was injured trying to protect my interests. You're gonna have to come up with a more efficient solution. And Mr. Trick, you better think of it soon."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy went immediately to the library, and Giles called everyone.</P>
<p>"We have a problem." Wesley said. "The Mayor seems to be more informed about this town's demonic activity then we realized."</P>
<p>"That's an understatement." Willow said. "Are you okay, Buffy?"</P>
<p>"Considering I just got interrogated by the police, and watched a man die…I could be worse."</P>
<p>"Well, if you're worried about jail time, don't be. I doubt they have enough evidence to hold you, and not even the Mayor's word would be enough." Giles said.</P>
<p>"What does he want?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>"Me in the ground?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"I think it's more than that." Giles said.</P>
<p>"I tend to agree. If your information is correct, we have to work to find out as much as possible about Mr. Richard Wilkins III before graduation." Wesley said.</P>
<p>"Let's do it then." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Yeah, I really would like to graduate." Cordelia said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Trick was sitting in the Mayor's chair, when Faith came walking in.</P>
<p>"You're doing it already." Faith said.</P>
<p>"The man's losing control. Invincibility only gets you so far. Gotta be ready to take the reigns."</P>
<p>Faith walked over to the blinds.</P>
<p>"I'd get out of that chair before you make a mistake."</P>
<p>"Or he'll kill me? You've made plenty of mistakes and your still kicking."</P>
<p>"Trick do you know what time it is?"</P>
<p>He looked at her, and then he understood. But it was too late. She opened the blinds, and the morning sun poured in. Within seconds, the screaming stopped, and the dust settled on the chair.</P>
<p>"I hope you know what you're doing, my dear." The Mayor walked in.</P>
<p>"Vampires are good for fighting, but once they get a brain, they're dangerous. Believe me."</P>
<p>"Oh I do. Just one thing." Faith looked scared for a minute. "Clean off the chair?"</P>
