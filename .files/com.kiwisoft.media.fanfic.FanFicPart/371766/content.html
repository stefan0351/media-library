<P><B>chappie 2. enjoy! :)</B></P><P>Okay, so now my dad is forcing me to call my soon-to-be-step-sister by her real name. Not only that, but he and Blondie are making me and <I>Lilly </I>hang out. So here I am in <I>my </I>bathroom in <I>my </I>bedroom getting ready so we can leave in <I>her </I>car, since Blondie, unlike my dad, trusts her enough to give her one. This sucks.</P><P>"Are you almost ready?" Lilly calls through the door with that fake sweetness she fills her voice with when one of our parents are around.</P><P>I pinch the bridge of my nose and sigh. "Go away."</P><P>"I wish. Just hurry up."</P><P>"Damn, what's the rush?"</P><P>"We gotta be there on time."</P><P>"Where? We don't have to schedule an appointment to hit the mall."</P><P>"Just hurry."</P><P>Bitch. I'll be ready when I'm ready. I do the finishing touches with my black eyeliner, lace up my knee-high boots, ruffle my hair and throw open the door. Standing there with a slightly impatient look on her face is Lavend-I mean, Lilly. Her arms are crossed and she's tapping her foot.</P><P>"Finally. Could you have gone any slower?"</P><P>Shoving past her to grab my bag I say, "I thought I was supposed to be the bitch around here."</P><P>"Trust me, you are." Once she'd been here for a couple days, she got tired of all my crap and turned frigid.</P><P>I send a scowl her way then head out the door, standing in the doorway. "You coming or what?"</P><P>"What, you wanna make sure I don't steal anything before we leave? I've been sharing this room with you for a week, if I wanted to steal something I would've already."</P><P>"No, I'm worried about Robby Ray finding my stash."</P><P>"What stash?" A husky voice from behind me asks. I whirl around to find myself face to face with my father.</P><P>"My stash of...Snickers bars. If you find them your fat ass will eat them by the time I get home."</P><P>A look mixed with shock and hurt took over his face, but quickly evaporated as anger took over. "Miley Ray, if you're doing drugs I'll-"</P><P>"You'll what, <I>Dad</I>? Find them and do them yourself so I don't have to? How chivalrous of you."</P><P>"Miley-"</P><P>"Save it, let's go, Lilly."</P><P>Timid, Lilly followed behind me out of my room then headed out to the car while I locked the door. I bought my own doorknob years ago and installed it myself so I could have a key-hole lock that only I had the key to. Even though Lilly had been here for a week, she was still embarrassed when she happened to be around when Robby Ray and I fought.</P><P>I shoved past the man everyone calls my father and run out to Lilly's car, jumping in the passenger's side. As she was pulling out of the driveway she muttered, "He's not gonna like you sitting there."</P><P>"Who?"</P><P>"Oliver."</P><P>"Who's Oliver? Your boyfriend?"</P><P>"Hah, hardly. More like best friend."</P><P>I gave her a look as she pulled onto the road. "Please. You can't be best friends with a guy without having some kind of friends-with-benefits thing going."</P><P>"Trust me, you can."</P><P>"That's the second time today you've told me to trust you."</P><P>"Yeah. So?"</P><P>"I don't. Trust you, I mean."</P><P>"Is that supposed to surprise me? You never listen to anything I say why would this be any different?"</P><P>"Okay well you can just drop me off at my friend Laine's house. She lives like 4 blocks away."</P><P>She looked at me like I'd lost my mind. "Are you on drugs?" Now it was my turn for the look. "Our parents told us we have to hang out today, so that's what we're gonna do."</P><P>"Geez, do you always do what your mommy tells you?"</P><P>"Man, you don't know me at all," she says with a scoff.</P><P>"Good. Let's keep it that way."</P><P>"Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of our Step-Sister Bonding Day?"</P><P>"One: We're not step-sisters yet. Two: You bringing your little boy toy kind of ruins the whole bonding thing, too."</P><P>"No it doesn't. And he's so not my boy toy."</P><P>"Sure."</P><P>"Trust me, I'm not his type, and he's not mine."</P><P>"Yeah, okay, sure, whatever you say."</P><P>It was silent for the rest of the 7 minute drive to Liver Boy's house. Trust me, it was exactly 7 minutes, I was counting. When he emerged from his house I immediately understood what she meant by her not being his type. He wore a skin-tight, white polo shirt with Abercrombie jeans. His brown hair was perfectly straightened, better than a girl's.</P><P>"That is the biggest fucking fairy I've ever seen." I told Lilly.</P><P>She looked at me with a smile on her face. "But he's my fairy."</P><P>He approached my car door and spoke to Lilly through my open window. "Lills! You said I could have shotgun! Oh my gosh, is this her? Miley right? I've heard so much about you!" He looked past me to Lilly and winked. What the hell was that supposed to mean?</P><P>"Well that was before I came along. Now you get back seat. Jump in," I said, pointing to the back.</P><P>He pouted, but surprisingly did as I told him to. When he was all buckled up and in the car Lilly started back down his driveway and headed to the mall.</P><P>"So, Miley, tell me all about yourself. As if I don't already know everything from this one!" He said, playfully shoving Lilly in the shoulder.</P><P>"You've been talking about me?"</P><P>"No, he's off his meds."</P><P>"Hey, little missy, you know I don't do that stuff!"</P><P>She shot him a conspiratorial smile. "Much."</P><P>"Back to Miley! Tell me everything! Very cool lip ring by the way. When did you get that done?"</P><P>"The same time I got my tattoo."</P><P>"You have a tattoo?" Lilly and Oliver exclaimed in unison.</P><P>"Yep."</P><P>"Where? Of what?" Lilly asked.</P><P>"Only special people get to see the tattoo."</P><P>"Oh okay. You hear that, Lills? We're not special enough to see her tattoo," Oliver says.</P><P>"I'm so broken hearted," Lilly replies, mocking me.</P><P>"I bet you are." Oliver mumbled under his breath.</P><P>Lilly shoots him a look and I pretend not to listen.</P><P>When we get to the mall we all get out and go inside, several people staring at Oliver like he's a circus animal; For once, people aren't staring at me, I'm not the freak.</P><P>"So where to first, ladies?" Oliver asks.</P><P>They both look at me expectantly like I'm supposed to choose. "I don't know. You guys pick somewhere."</P><P>"Oh my gosh! I hate when people do that! Just make a decision, assert yourself!"</P><P>"Could you be any gay-er?" I ask.</P><P>He smiles at me. "Nope."</P><P>"Wonderful."</P><P>And so the Step-Sister Plus Gay Boy Bonding Day begins.</P><P><B>good? yes? no? maybe? criticism is always welcome. tell me what ya think! :D</B></P>
