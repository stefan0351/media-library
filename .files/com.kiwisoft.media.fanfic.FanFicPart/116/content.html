<!-- Who Am I? \ Restart (Or - Five By Five What?) -->

<p>"Who am I?" Faith asked herself sitting
in the back of the truck.</p>
<p>Everyone asked themselves that at one point
or another, but for Faith, it was not a casual, fleeting question. She
needed an answer, and she needed it then and there. She had just spent
the previous night, and the better part of a day in Buffy Summers' body.
And she had experienced things she had never thought possible.</p>
<p>She was running down the list in her head.
She had been appreciated, she had been loved, by a parent and by a boyfriend,
and she had done the right thing. And shockingly, looking back, it had
felt good. But she had to keep reminding herself that the love, the gratitude,
was not for her. It was for Buffy.</p>
<p>Looking at down at her own body now, she
was ashamed at what she had let it become. It had been wore down, used,
and it had killed. She stared at her hands in disgust. The hands that had
held weapons used for murder. And without assistance her hands had killed
through brute force.</p>
<p>It was a sickening feeling, hating your
own body. Wanting to destroy it but knowing the little voice in her head,
the one designed to keep survival a priority, would not let her. Where
had that voice been last year? When she started on the dark path that had
become her life? She let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>It had been there. She had just convinced
it that murdering was necessary for survival. She might not have been able
to hurt herself, but that didn't mean she couldn't let anyone else do it
for her. The voice popped up again, telling her she was almost out, almost
free.</p>
<p>She knew now that the voice was corrupted.
She shut it up, and banged on the truck.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" The driver called back.</p>
<p>"Let me out."</p>
<p>"We're not out of town yet."</p>
<p>"Just stop."</p>
<p>She felt the truck slow down, and she opened
the back doors, hopping out. She shut them again, and hit them, telling
the driver to take off. As the vehicle pulled away, she walked along the
road, hoping that she might get hit accidentally. She just wanted everything
to be over.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"How could you not know?" Buffy asked Riley
eventually, after the lingering thoughts of Faith had plagued her long
enough.</p>
<p>"She…I don't know…she came on a little
strong at first…"</p>
<p>"Did she? Maybe I shouldn't have asked
for an explanation." She got up off of his bed, and faced away from him.</p>
<p>"But I told her I didn't want that. And
then…"</p>
<p>Buffy turned around to face him now, her
strong, interrogating Slayer face on. "Then what?"</p>
<p>"She was you. And I bought it."</p>
<p>"She was me? Just because she had my body
doesn't mean…come on, Riley."</p>
<p>"I'm not…what I did, there's no excuse
for. I just know what happened. And you can do whatever you want with me,
because I'd deserve it."</p>
<p>"So," Buffy couldn't believe she was asking
this, "what happened?"</p>
<p>"Details aside…"</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"I was making love to Buffy Summers. She
didn't act like…she acted like you. Maybe it was because she knows you
so well…"</p>
<p>"She didn't do anything 'un-me' at all?"</p>
<p>"Surprised."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Surprised. She seemed surprised that someone
was…well, hindsight doesn't really help right now, does it?"</p>
<p>"I know you didn't think that it wasn't
me, and I'm sure Faith was convincing," she said 'convincing' in a harsh
tone, "but that still doesn't make it any better."</p>
<p>Riley got out of the chair, and Buffy turned
her head away from him. He cupped her cheek in his hand. "Hey. I love you.
You have to know that, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know."</p>
<p>He bent down and kissed her softly. "Then
punish me."</p>
<p>Buffy went wide-eyed. "Now wait a second.
Faith may go in for that, but I don't. And you're in the doghouse as it
is."</p>
<p>He laughed quietly. "I meant I'll do whatever
it takes to make it up to you. As long as you don't plan on never seeing
me again."</p>
<p>"Oh." She flushed. "Well, good. And -"</p>
<p>Then the ringing began. They both looked
toward the source of the noise, which was the phone. She pointed to it,
and he went over and picked it up.</p>
<p>"Hello?…You're sure?…Where?…No, tell them
not to engage…No, I'll check it out…Probably…Well it's not your call…Thank
you for the information, Agent."</p>
<p>Riley hung the receiver up, and closed
his eyes in frustration.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Buffy asked him.</p>
<p>"Forrest…oh you mean…it's Faith. She's
still here."</p>
<p>"She's what?"</p>
<p>"She's walking along the road just outside
of town. Patrol team spotted her about five minutes ago."</p>
<p>"I gotta go, then." Buffy said, already
making her way toward the door.</p>
<p>"Buffy I can -"</p>
<p>"Just me."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith continued along the road, staying
just off of the asphalt. She still couldn't work up the guts to step out
and see what happened to collide with her. The voice had surfaced again,
screaming with all its might to keep her out of harm's way. But she was
slowly beating it down.</p>
<p>Who was going to care, anyway? Buffy wasn't
going to rush in to stop her, Willow most certainly didn't care, Xander
was scared of her, and Giles, he would…he wasn't sure what he would do.
She had nothing to live for. No job, no place, no family, she had had friends
once, but she blew that chance.</p>
<p>She watched as a Sports car flew by. If
she had been run over by that, there was still a chance at living. Then
she saw a bread truck. Perfect. And just so there was no risk of the driver
seeing her and breaking before impact, she quickly walked out into the
road, effectively killing the voice, and laid down.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>And wait…then she felt something pull her
up. Before she realized what was going on, she was being forced to run
back off the road. When her feet touched the grass, the force holding her
up let go, and she fell.</p>
<p>"What the hell did you think you were doing?"
Buffy's voice asked her.</p>
<p>Great. She may have killed the voice, but
it came back to life as Buffy. That's when she turned her head, and saw
that it was really Buffy standing over her.</p>
<p>"B. I never thought you'd come."</p>
<p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p>"I never thought you'd come? Not really
a brain teaser." Buffy stood in a defensive position, waiting for Faith's
attack, but it never came. The brown-haired slayer, simply laid on her
back in the grass. "I'm glad you did, actually."</p>
<p>"You are?"</p>
<p>"It's always nice to having someone you
know around to witness your suicide. Notes are for the weak."</p>
<p>"That's what you were doing? For what possible
reason?"</p>
<p>"Heard it was in this year. You know me,
B. Always stayin' with the trends."</p>
<p>"That's…wrong." Faith let out a full-fledged
laugh now. "What? What'd I say?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Forget it. And why do you care
what happens to me? One less problem for you and your gang to worry about."</p>
<p>Buffy finally eased herself to a sitting
position near the other girl. "Is that what you think you are?"</p>
<p>"I know what I am. And I know what I am
to you."</p>
<p>"You have no idea -"</p>
<p>"Oh I do. Changing houses gave me a whole
new perspective. The Scoobies hate me, and so do you."</p>
<p>"Okay, so maybe they have a grudge or two…and
why are we having a heart to heart?"</p>
<p>"Damned if I know. I'm just waiting for
you to kill me."</p>
<p>"God, Faith…what happened to you? And I'm
not going to kill you."</p>
<p>"I don't know who the hell I am anymore.
And you didn't have a problem getting it done last year."</p>
<p>"I wasn't trying to kill you. I was playing
by your rules. I was being what you wanted me to be. Besides, you're the
one who jumped off the roof."</p>
<p>"Potato, Pototto. And I'd never want you
to be like me. Ever."</p>
<p>"Let's get everything out. I tried to reach
out to you, but you weren't being receptive girl. But you kept pushing
and pushing for me to see your side of things. And I did. Things got out
of hand. So don't say you didn't want me to."</p>
<p>"If you're gonna get technical, then, okay,
yeah. Then. Now, if you ever, ever turned out like me…well you were me.
How was it?"</p>
<p>Buffy looked down at her hands. "I…you…got
spit on."</p>
<p>"Really? Got off easy. I tried so hard
to be me in there," she pointed to Buffy, "but I ended up being you."</p>
<p>"You were in control. You could've done
anything you wanted. And from what Riley told me, you did."</p>
<p>"That boy has it hot for you."</p>
<p>"And you enjoyed taking advantage of that,
didn't you?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to, but I couldn't."</p>
<p>"You couldn't?" Buffy half-stated and half-asked.
She didn't believe it. "He used the L word. It wasn't for me."</p>
<p>Buffy thought for a few moments, contemplating
what to do. Faith was on the verge of something, and Buffy didn't quite
get it yet. But she wanted to. And if she pushed her away now, it would've
been her last chance to reach the other slayer.</p>
<p>Buffy stood up, and reached out her hand.
"What do you say we get outta here?"</p>
<p>"And go where? Cops want me, remember?"</p>
<p>"They won't find you."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The two witches had just returned to Tara's
room.</p>
<p>"So…you do that kind of thing a lot?" Tara
asked Willow.</p>
<p>"You mean the waiting while Buffy kills
the evil things? I used to do it a lot more, but yeah, I have experience."</p>
<p>"Have you ever been hurt?" Tara asked quickly.</p>
<p>"Once. It's a long story."</p>
<p>"You did it for her, didn't you? Whatever,
you know, happened?"</p>
<p>Willow sat on the bed. "Yeah. I…it was…I
just wanted to see her happy." She smiled. "What'd you think of her? The
real her."</p>
<p>"She was nice. I don't know if she likes
me, though."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"She's protective of you. She cares about
you."</p>
<p>"I care about her too. We're best friends.
She has to be cautious. It comes with her job. But once she gets to know
you…"</p>
<p>"It's good that she watches out for you.
I just…don't want her to hate me."</p>
<p>"She doesn't hate you. Well, unless you're
planning to hurt me. But I know you're not."</p>
<p>Tara shook her head quickly. "No! No way."</p>
<p>Willow grabbed her hand, and smiled. "You
want to go find her so she can get to know you better? She'll like you
as much as I do. I know she will."</p>
<p>"Okay." Tara said, nodding.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy led Faith into the college's empty
gymnasium. They walked over onto the mats.</p>
<p>"Hang on, I'll be right back." Buffy said.
She walked near the back of the gym and disappeared into a side room.</p>
<p>"This isn't exactly below cop radar."</p>
<p>"Please. The police in this town don't
see anything unless it's right in front of them. And even then they're
still blind." Buffy said, coming back with a punching bag. "Point is, they
aren't going to come here looking for you. They probably think you're long
gone."</p>
<p>"So what are we doing here?"</p>
<p>"Blowing off some steam," Buffy said hooking
the bag to chain that came down from the ceiling, "and we're going to work
this whole thing out."</p>
<p>"Okay it's my turn to ask this now. Why
aren't you attacking me?"</p>
<p>"Cause I don't attack somebody that isn't
attacking me. But you really wanna know why?" Faith shrugged, but she really
did want to know. "I don't want to. I never really have. You're like a
sister to me."</p>
<p>Faith tried very, very hard not to let
her jaw hang open in shock.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Giles was eating a salad, his lunch, when
Spike barged in, jacket over his head. The vampire slammed the door shut,
and stood there looking at the ex-watcher, clearly angry. Giles simply
took a bite of his salad.</p>
<p>"You too?" Spike growled. "Goddamn chip!"</p>
<p>Giles looked up finally. "Something wrong,
Spike?"</p>
<p>"Everyone's a comedian. Well I don't need
it. You here me?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly. Why are you here? Because I
seem to recall your least words to me were, 'I hate you all.'"</p>
<p>"I do. With a bloody passion."</p>
<p>"Then would you mind leaving?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I would." Spike sat on the couch
by the TV. "It's that Slayer of yours. She's pissing me off."</p>
<p>"And you expect me to care why?"</p>
<p>"She's losing her mind, and I can't take
it."</p>
<p>"Fine, I suppose I'll ask. Why exactly
is she loosing her mind?"</p>
<p>"It's not so much her mind as her morals.
Buffy the Vampire Slut."</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Giles asked, nearly choking
on a crouton.</p>
<p>"Yeah. That's right. She was all over me.
Flaunting it."</p>
<p>"And this was when?"</p>
<p>"Last night. I just…god, if I could just
tear out her throat…only her. That's all I ask."</p>
<p>"Oh." Giles said in a relieved tone. "I
believe that was Faith."</p>
<p>"Wait." Spike said rising from the couch
and walking over to the table. "You said Faith was brow-haired," he raised
his hand just below his neck, "this tall, and criminally insane."</p>
<p>"She is, but there was a slight mix up."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith was punching the bag repeatedly as
Buffy held it. The brown-haired slayer was clearly angry, and she was making
the bag hurt.</p>
<p>"Talk to me. You had a chance to screw
up my life, but didn't. Why?"</p>
<p>"Because…I…couldn't. I was gonna. Destroy
your life, split. But it's meaningless. It's all meaningless."</p>
<p>"My life?"</p>
<p>"Mine." She stopped punching and was breathing
heavily. "This body screws and kills. Yours loves and saves. See the difference?"</p>
<p>"You're not your body. You're you. A body
doesn't make you who you are."</p>
<p>"What did you do to get away from the Council
guys? Did you reason with them?"</p>
<p>"I tried."</p>
<p>"But it didn't take, did it? They didn't
care what you had to say, did they? So what did you have to do? Use violence?
Threaten? Why didn't you act like you?"</p>
<p>"I know what you're driving at, okay? So
you have a rep. You can change."</p>
<p>"It's too late. My place is set. It was
cool being in your shoes. Being appreciated was...made me realize
how big I screwed up. I made the wrong choices, and I can't fix it. It’s
easy for you to say I can. You've got it better."</p>
<p>"Do you hate me?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I did. Cause the Mayor convinced
me it was easier."</p>
<p>"Why'd you do it?"</p>
<p>"Survival, B. Appreciation. Love. He gave
it all. But you wouldn't understand."</p>
<p>"I know he loved you. I can't understand
how he could love anything, but I knew. I just wish I hadn't driven you
away."</p>
<p>"I drove myself away. If I had been in
your position, I would've gutted me too."</p>
<p>"Eight months, Faith. I lied when I said
I forgot about you. I wanted to tell you how sorry I was…"</p>
<p>"Let it lie. It's done."</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>They turned around and saw Willow and Tara
looking at them.</p>
<p>"Tara, right?" Buffy asked, trying to avoid
the situation that had just developed.</p>
<p>"Uh huh. Hi." The girl responded.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>Buffy turned to look at Faith, but the
other slayer was already running off.</p>
<p>"Faith, wait!"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy caught up with her at the side door
of the gym. Faith watched the other two girls' approach slowly, and she
put her hand on the door handle.</p>
<p>"I held a knife to her throat. I don't
think we're gonna bond."</p>
<p>"Maybe…maybe not. But I'm not letting you
leave. This is one of those choice moments, and I'm trying to help you
make the right one. Let me."</p>
<p>Buffy stared at her, and Faith slowly took
her arm off the door and brought it down to her side. Willow walked up,
Tara behind her.</p>
<p>"Explain." The redhead said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry?" Faith offered tentatively.
"To you too." She looked at Tara.</p>
<p>"What did you say to her?"</p>
<p>"It's okay." Tara said putting her hand
on Willow's shoulder.</p>
<p>"No it's not!" She's…"</p>
<p>"Telling the truth."</p>
<p>"Huh?" She looked at Tara quizzically.</p>
<p>"She is, Will." Buffy added.</p>
<p>"Look, I don't expect you to forgive me.
I'm just sorry." Faith said. "I don't know much anymore. But I do know
I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. Then Tara raised her
hand. "Can I…ask you a question?"</p>
<p>"Sure." Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"What's five by five mean?"</p>
<p>They all smirked a little, and then Faith
answered her. "I'll let you figure it out. I'm not 'it' anymore. I can
tell you that."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Well I can't speak for anyone else," Buffy
started, "but if you let me, I'd like to help get you back there."</p>
<p>Buffy, Tara and Faith stared at Willow.
The hacker/wicca couldn't handle the stares, and as much as she wanted
to, she couldn't go against her nature. "As long as it doesn't involve
sharp, metal objects, I'll help."</p>
<p>"It's gonna be hard, isn't it?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Probably." Buffy admitted.</p>
<p>"Fun factor?"</p>
<p>"Zero."</p>
<p>"I haven't given that lifestyle much of
a shot. I'll give it a go. Cops?"</p>
<p>"We'll handle it." Willow said, referring
to her and Tara.</p>
<p>"Ready for the first problem?" Buffy asked
Faith.</p>
<p>"Shoot."</p>
<p>"My boyfriend."</p>
<p>"Oh…right. Ah, aren't sisters supposed
to share?" Buffy had a disbelieving look. "Kidding, B. You know I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have, but…I never, felt like…"</p>
<p>"It's…a start." Buffy looked at Willow
and her friend. "You two coming?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." Willow said. "Tara?"</p>
<p>"Right behind you."</p>
