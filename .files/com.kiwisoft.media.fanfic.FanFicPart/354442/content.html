<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 4: Changing relationships -->

<p>Buffy leaned forward and brushed her lips ever so slightly over
Willow’s.</p>
<p>"I love you too Willow Rosenberg."</p>
<p>A few moments of silence followed where Willow was absolutely still before
she broke it.</p>
<p>"What?" Willow asked unable to believe what she just had heard, had
felt.</p>
<p>"I love you too" Buffy answered her smile showing how happy she was and how
serious she meant that.</p>
<p>Willow blushed.</p>
<p>"Please pinch me... ...Ouch.. ok so I’m not dreaming"</p>
<p>"No you aren’t, I love you"</p>
<p>"I-I-I lo... I love you too"</p>
<p>"I know"</p>
<p>"B-but how?"</p>
<p>"Well you remember that talk we had three weeks ago, that one about the
true love?"</p>
<p>Willow blushed even more, almost glowing bright red by now.</p>
<p>"W-well y-yes"</p>
<p>"And I’m sure that you have noticed that I was keeping an eye on you since
then."</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"Well I was trying to figure out why you had said that I should look for a
woman as true love. And I noticed that you have changed and that you were acting
different when I was near you. More closed as if you were hiding something. At
first I thought that it might be something I had done and that it wasn’t good
what that could have been. But then just about ten minutes ago I saw that you
were really worried about me and that you were more caring than even my mother
had ever been to me. And then I knew that the only reason why you would act so
was because you loved me. And I mean more than a friend does. And that’s why I
decided to offer you my feelings." Buffy’s smile seemed to be a wide grin by
now.</p>
<p>"I love you more than anything else Buffy."</p>
<p>"And I love you."</p>
<p>They moved together and their lips met, both there where they had wished
them selves for so long.</p>

<p>After that Willow moved onto Buffy’s bed joining her new lover and kissed
her, more passionately this time. They deepened their kiss when Willow parted
her lips inviting Buffy’s tongue into her own mouth, tasting her lips sucking on
them and sucking on her tongue. Buffy in return explored Willows mouth and every
single curve of her lips and tongue. She enjoyed the sweet taste of Willow and
started a fight in the only place where she was equal with her ‘enemy’. Willow
encountered that small battle between their tongues and let a low moan out.
Buffy groaned in return to the pleasures she knew Willow received from her. As
they finally broke apart to get breath it was the happiest moment in their
lives.</p>
<p>"Wow, Willow where did you learn that?"</p>
<p>"Learned what? I have only responded to what you did." she answered still
breathing heavily.</p>
<p>"Well then I have to ask myself where I have learned that," she said with a
grin on her features that -Willow could finally think about that without feeling
bad- was absolutely cute, and charming, "I know that I have never kissed like
this before so I really have no idea where it came from." Buffy finished the
sentence.</p>
<p>The redhead smiled and snuggled close up to Buffy letting herself go and
feel the protection the slayer gave her. They talked a little about this and
that before they both fell into a sleep full of dreams that they both knew would
now come true. Now that they were together.</p>
<p>But there was one dream that was different than the others. One that was
special, both in its content and by the way they had that dream. It was again
one of those dreams -not the first one and surely not the last one- which they
both shared. A dream that were in both minds at the same time, connecting them
together more than normal love could ever had.</p>

<p>It was Saturday morning as Giles called them that he had found something
and that they should come and see it themselves. So as they entered his house
and saw the frowned face Giles had, they exactly knew that it was even worse
than they had expected.</p>
<p>"Hello Buffy... Willow" he said nodding towards them "if you would please
follow me"</p>
<p>"That bad?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>He just nodded and lead them into his own small library, which mostly
contained the books that have been ‘rescued’ from the Sunnydale High library
before the ascension. He told them to take a seat and then went out to get a few
books that he had used to find out about what was going on.</p>
<p>"This must be really bad, did you see that concern on his face?" Willow
asked.</p>
<p>"Mmm hmmm"</p>
<p>"Well that means that I may have to get active and see what I can do."
Willow smiled.</p>
<p>"I’m sure my little wicca will do what she can to help me." Buffy smiled
back.</p>
<p>As Giles came back he had at least a half dozen books in his arms. He
handed them one and told them to open it. They did as told and Giles started to
talk about what they saw.</p>
<p>"Well as you can see, or better, as what most think it looks like, this
demon is a very unique one simply by that that it is invisible, well at least to
the human eye. Most demons can see it and we suppose that is because of the
infrared part of the spectrum that most are able to see..."</p>
<p>"Please Giles, all I actually want to know is how I can kill it." Buffy
insisted.</p>
<p>"Well, Buffy as much as I know that you don’t like this part of the
discussion, as much I am sure that you should listen to it this time." Buffy
just nodded cause she knew that it must be bad if Giles started to talk that
way. "Well as I just started to explain we aren’t really sure how it looks like
because all those drawings base on the description of other demons that were
interrogated by the council and most of them weren’t really in the constitution
to give exact answers. That also means that we don’t have much information about
that and since my connection to the council is broken I have no way to find out
if they know more by now."</p>
<p>He made a short break and then continued.</p>
<p>"I may have a chance to find some information in the college library but I
can’t promise anything. But what I do know is that the one you had that
encounter with is only the first of many, kind of a scout. He checks the
surroundings and tells the leaders what they have to expect. And as I have
mentioned before all information I have is based on earlier incidents, and from
not really cooperative demons and that means that the council was not able to
capture one of those neither living nor dead, at least not before I have been
fired. And that is the problem. We know what they are and that most of them are
encountered in fairly large numbers. We have a few clues about how they look
like and what other abilities they have but not many. And that means that we
have to find out what we have to do with them. It is known that they mostly just
pass through the areas they were seen, or better, noticed in, but since this is
the hellmouth I suppose that they will stay for a while."</p>
<p>"You mentioned that they are visible in infrared light. Are you sure about
that?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Well, quite sure, yes. But I don’t know how that could help us... Oh yes,
why didn’t I have that idea. That is it. That’s how we’ll be able to fight
them."</p>
<p>"Well we can fight them but you also said that they are mostly encountered
in large numbers which means that we need some help. I can’t fight against ten
or more at the same time, even if I could see them. And I know what I’m talking
about."</p>
<p>"Well maybe I can help there." the redhead said reading in one of the book
Giles had gave them. "I’m not really sure if I can keep them from attacking you
but here is a spell that can banish them back to hell. The only problem is that
I have to create a gateway for that and it is said here that no demon would ever
go near one of those. That means that you have to attack them and force them
near one of those gateways, I can do the rest from then." Willow looked up into
Buffy’s eyes and started to smile.</p>
<p>"Well as long as I don’t have to fight more than one or two at the same
time I think I can handle that. But if there are more than that -"</p>
<p>"Hey that’s it. That’s the way we can handle this." Willow interrupted
attracting both Giles and Buffy’s attention with that. Then she looked up and
blushed lightly.</p>
<p>"Sorry"</p>
<p>"No prob Will, just tell us what you have found out." Buffy assured
her.</p>
<p>"Well with a few extra ingredients and some help from Giles.." she said
pointing her head towards him ".. I can do the same trick they do with us and
make the gateway invisible to them. And here’s another spell that allows me to
project a fake of that gateway to another point near the original
one."</p>
<p>"Well that means that all I have to do is get them near that -for them
invisible- gateway and then you’ll suck them into it, right? I hope it won’t
suck me to hell. I really have no desire to go there"</p>
<p>"No, absolutely not. It only affects demons. The only problem is that I
can’t open a hidden one, I have to open a gateway and then hide it and that
means that you have to lure them towards it."</p>
<p>"Damn and I hoped this could be an easy do." Buffy sighed.</p>
