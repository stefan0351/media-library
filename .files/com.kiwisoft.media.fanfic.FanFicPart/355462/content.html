<p>Brooke opened her eyes slowly to an annoying sound that she couldn't
quite place, and looked around. There was something not quite right
about her surroundings, but she couldn't place that either, until her
brain registered the warm weight beside her on the bed. Actually, the
warm weight was sort of half on top of her, but seven thirty in the
morning is too early for details. </p>

<p>Finally she clicked. She was in Sam's room, and that sound was Sam's
alarm clock, and that warm lump was Sam herself! They'd slept
together last night, in the actual sense of the word, rather than
actually had sex, but Brooke still felt... satisfied. Like she'd
finally got what she wanted, and in a sense, she had, hadn't she?</p>

<p>Sam opened her eyes to see Brooke staring at her. It didn't register
with her, either, until she felt where Brooke's hand was: inside her
pajama top! And with that in mind, she reached over and kissed Brooke
on the forehead and jumped out of bed, suddenly energized beyond
belief. </p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke moaned. "Come back to bed." But Sam laughed and ignored
her, pulling off her pajamas and heading for the shower. </p>

<p>"School day, McQueen, or had you forgotten?"</p>

<p>Brooke groaned. "Selective memory," she giggled. "You hoping for that
shower solo, or are visitors welcome?"</p>

<p>"Visitors are always welcome if they're you," Sam purred. </p>

<p>Having showered (together) and dressed (reluctantly) the two bounced
down the stairs. Breakfast was fun. Making pancakes was so much more
fun with two! They made enough to feed the whole house, then settled
down to eat them. They sat across the table from each other like
usual. Sending each other sultry looks and playing footsie, they
bolted their food and prepared to leave for school about twenty
minutes early, so as to get in a spot of necking in the car before
school. This plan was cut to ribbons by Jane McPherson's appearance
in the doorway. </p>

<p>"You about to leave, girls?"</p>

<p>Sam gave her mother her biggest smile. This was the last nail in
their coffin, Jane thought to herself. She knew something was up, and
the change in Sam from yesterday's moping to today's beaming was even
more of a giveaway than what she'd seen last night. </p>

<p>"Yep! Brookie's just agreed to give me a ride to school, isn't that
nice of her?"</p>

<p>"But if we don't hurry, Sammy, we'll be late. Gotta beat that
traffic!" Brooke replied, equally chirpy. They prepared to bounce out
the door, but Jane stopped them. </p>

<p>"All right, you two. This has gone far enough. Do you want to tell me
what's going on, or do you want me to tell you what I know?"</p>

<p>Sam and Brooke stopped in their tracks. Turning around, Sam said,
carefully, "Why don't you tell us what you know."</p>

<p>Jane took a deep breath and began. "Okay. Well, for starters, your
behavior over the past couple weeks has been baffling. One day you're
fighting like cats and dogs, next thing Brooke's avoiding Sam. And
you think I didn't notice?"</p>

<p>The pair nodded. So far, so disturbing... </p>

<p>"And then today? Big smiles? And what did you have for breakfast, to
be calling each other by PET NAMES? Brookie? Sammy? Where did that
come from? But the thing that is the most damning, by a long shot, is
probably the fact that I noticed Brooke's bed wasn't slept in last
night. Hoping against hope you two were having a friendly sleep over,
I checked your room, Sam. And what did I find but the two of you,
dead to the world, in the same bed?"</p>

<p>"Mom, it's hardly fair to make Brooke sleep on the floor. She
volunteered to leave her room, just so we could have a... girly chat
sleep over. So I said to her, we're both adults, I think we can share
the bed. I share beds with Lily and Carmen all the time! Hell, I even
used to share a bed with Harrison, and you didn't care! What's the
big deal?"</p>

<p>"Since I obviously haven't got my point across well enough, I'll tell
you what the big deal is. I would have been fine with a `girly chat
sleep over', but how many `girly chat sleep overs' have you been to
where you fall asleep with your hands up each other's tops?"</p>

<p>Busted. </p>
