<p>Thank you everyone who left me such awesome and encouraging reviews. I'd been worried no one even remembered The Lightning Tree, but I was proven wrong ;) As much as I'd love to do daily updates, life, or school rather, says otherwise, so I'm going to try and update once a week. Hopefully I'll get some extra writing time over winter break. I have a feeling this story's going to be a lengthy one, so get ready for a long ride...</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter II</b></p>
<p>"So, Miley, how do you like your new room?"</p>
<p>Miley just gave a non-committal shrug, which was so unlike her it drew stares from the other three women at the table. Of course she liked her new room and the new house, which was ten times better than the old one, with shiny wooden floors, fresh paint, new appliances and furniture and even a TV that hadn't seen the end of the Cold War. What she didn't like was the man currently sitting at the head of the table, as if he were the head of the house.</p>
<p>"Your mom spent a lot of time finding just the right things for your room. She really wanted you to feel at home," said Richard, his voice smooth, kind and conciliatory, but to Miley it all sounded like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p>Miley looked up from her half-eaten slice of pizza. The man just refused to stop talking to her, as if he could lull her into a false sense of security with his words. Of course, he'd already done so with her grandma, mother and even Lilly. She looked at him closely â€“ warm, brown eyes, short, dark hair and a chiseled jaw with just a hint of stubble, but unlike everyone else, she wasn't taken with him. He met her eyes and smiled and Miley looked back down at her pizza.</p>
<p>Susan suppressed a sigh, but it was getting harder and harder to deal with Miley's strange attitude towards Richard. He was the first man she'd dated since her husband's death and though she hadn't expected it to be easy, Miley was making things incredibly difficult. Susan considered herself lucky Richard was such an easy-going, understanding and loving man. She watched Miley flick at a pineapple on her hardly touched slice of the pizza Richard had specifically gotten for her and this time couldn't stop the sigh escaping her lips. "Miley."</p>
<p>Miley looked up at her mother, not happy. "What, momma? You only said I had to come down here and eat, not that I had to talk to him."</p>
<p>"Richard, I'm so sorry." Susan tried to apologize, but Richard merely waved her off.</p>
<p>"No, Susan, don't worry about it. I know how hard it can be; my parents divorced when I was young and it wasn't easy to see them start dating again."</p>
<p>Miley looked over at Richard, finally meeting his eyes. "My dad is dead."</p>
<p>Richard swallowed, though he didn't break eye contact. "I know, Miley and I'm very sorry. But don't you think your mom deserves some happiness?"</p>
<p>Miley glanced at her mom across from her, who looked just as uncomfortable as the rest of table at the sudden turn in conversation. She shrugged. "Yes, of course she does."</p>
<p>"Well, thenâ€¦"</p>
<p>Miley interrupted Richard. "That doesn't mean it has to be with you."</p>
<p>"Miley Ray Stewart, I have half a mind to put you over my knee!" All eyes turned to Grandma Ruby, who looked angrier than anyone else. She'd always protected Miley and probably spoiled her a good amount, but insolence she could not tolerate.</p>
<p>Miley looked sheepish, but nowhere near as happy or excited as normally. "I'm sorry, grandma."</p>
<p>Lilly was seriously considering grabbing Miley's arm and pulling her away before she could get herself into more trouble. It was so unlike her girlfriend to be this rude to someone and though Lilly could understand Miley's problem with her mother having a new boyfriend, she definitely didn't like it. She had seen people treat Miley like dirt for months, throw stones at her and her girlfriend had never as much as said a mean word in return.</p>
<p>Grandma Ruby wasn't done, however. "Don't apologize to me, Miley. Apologize to Richard; he's been nothing but nice to you and you've been a right brat."</p>
<p>"No, Ruby, it's alright." Richard was actually laughing at Miley's words and Lilly worried that would only incense her more. "I always told Miley to tell me how she feels, that hasn't changed. She's always been veryâ€¦verbal with her feelings."</p>
<p>Miley scoffed, not liking how he refused to be riled up. "That's 'cause you used to torture me."</p>
<p>Richard shook his head, though the smile hadn't vanished from his face. He picked up his slice of pizza, carrying on as if Miley's accusations didn't bother him one bit. "How do you like your new physical therapist?"</p>
<p>"At least <b>she</b> won't end up dating my mother," said Miley, back to looking at her slice of pizza. She knew she was probably going to be grounded for days after this, just when she'd escaped that prison of a hospital. Why did Richard have to be here and ruin her homecoming?</p>
<p>Richard just laughed again, obviously amused by the comment Miley hadn't intended as a joke. The adults started a conversation Miley didn't pretend to be interested in and she continued to pick at her pizza without enthusiasm. She could feel Lilly's eyes on her, but didn't want to look at her girlfriend, either. Miley knew Lilly wouldn't be mad at her over this, but she, too, liked Richard. After a few minutes, she sighed and looked at her mother.</p>
<p>"Momma, may I be excused?"</p>
<p>Susan almost wanted to force Miley to stay, but sadness in her daughter's eyes made her decide otherwise. "Fine, go ahead."</p>
<p>Miley didn't even try to get away this time, instead grabbing her crutches and making her way as fast as possible out of the dining room. Just a few seconds later they heard a door slam shut and Susan narrowed her eyes. "Did she just go outside?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and Grandma Ruby merely mumbled something incoherent that was surely threatening physical harm to Miley's backside. Susan sighed, but looked across the table at the younger girl. "Lillyâ€¦?"</p>
<p>"I'll go," said Lilly, already out of her chairs and on her way to the front door. She just hoped she wasn't too late to stop Miley from climbing something.</p>
<p><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>It was already dark outside and the air was cold when Lilly opened the front door. She grabbed her jacket from the hook by the door and noticed Miley's still hanging there, too. She grabbed that, as well, and made her way out into the front yard. The only light came from the porch lamp and it was too weak for her to really be able to see anything. It was pitch dark and silent out there and Lilly listened intently for any signs Miley had climbed a tree. She heard nothing and turned to her right, noticing a weak light coming from the barn.</p>
<p>The barn door creaked as Lilly opened it and slipped inside. Miley looked up at the sound and offered her a smile, though it didn't seem as exuberant as usual. Miley was sitting on a hay bale, a lantern by her feet as she watched the sleeping chickens. Lilly noticed the crutches had been thrown haphazardly onto the ground by her feet. She made her way over and sat next to Miley. Lilly handed Miley the jacket she'd brought and the younger girl shrugged it on without comment.</p>
<p>"Your grandma will be mad if you wake the chickens," said Lilly softly, eyes scanning the rows of roosting hens on their perches.</p>
<p>Miley merely shrugged, as if the thought of creating havoc among the chickens left her cold. Lilly looked at her and took her hand. "What's wrong, Road kill?"</p>
<p>"I don't like Richard," said Miley seriously, though her lip had twitched slightly at her nickname.</p>
<p>"I could tell. I know you don't like him dating your mom, but I think she really likes him, Miles."</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "I didn't like him before, either, when he just came to torture me."</p>
<p>Lilly chuckled slightly. "I don't think physical therapy is torture, Miley."</p>
<p>"It sure felt like it," said Miley, making a face. She stretched her legs out in front of her, staring at them silently for several minutes. "He's hiding something, Lilly; I can feel it."</p>
<p>"Hiding what?" asked Lilly, trying not to sound too skeptical. Richard seemed like a pretty nice guy and she didn't quite understand her girlfriend's intense dislike of him, but no matter what, she'd be on Miley's side.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged and looked at Lilly. "I don't know, but it's something big. He's lying; I just know it."</p>
<p>"Maybe he's just lying about something stupid, or embarrassing? Likeâ€¦he's been married five times, or he used to be a woman."</p>
<p>Miley gave her an incredulous look and Lilly smiled softly. She leaned forward and kissed Miley gently, trying to convey all the love and affection she felt. When she pulled back, Miley was finally smiling in that totally adorable way of hers, sparkling eyes and all. "Do you wanna go inside and cuddle until I have to go?"</p>
<p>"I had something else in mind," said Miley, grinning now and Lilly rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Do you remember how six months ago you were totally innocent?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "Yes. And then I found out how much fun sex is, so now it's my favorite thing to do."</p>
<p>"Your favorite? More favorite than climbing trees?" Lilly was trying not to laugh at the serious look on Miley's face, as if the younger girl were really trying to figure out this dilemma.</p>
<p>"I can do both."</p>
<p>"At the same time?"</p>
<p>"That would be hard, but if you want, we can try." Miley sounded completely serious and Lilly finally laughed. She stood and held out her hand to Miley, who took it and let herself be pulled up, as well.</p>
<p>"I think for now we'll just stick to the hayloft, or our bedrooms. Come on, let's go inside." Lilly grabbed the lantern and bent down to hand Miley her crutches.</p>
<p>"Are we going to christen my new bed?" asked Miley, once again sounding completely serious, but the slight twitch of the corner of her mouth gave her away.</p>
<p>Lilly made sure the barn door was locked and followed Miley back to the house. She shook her head, "Keep on dreaming, Road kill."</p>
<p><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"So, Miley, have you been on any adventures lately?"</p>
<p>Miley grimaced at the question, wondering why he had to make it sound like she was 12-years-old looking for secret treasures. She just liked to climb trees.</p>
<p>"She's already climbing trees again," said Susan from off to the side, watching the doctor examining her daughter. She was still a little mad at Miley for her treatment of Richard, but seeing her daughter in a doctor's office or hospital always made her uneasy. She'd come too close to losing Miley and some of her annoyance with the girl faded at the thought.</p>
<p>"Climbing trees? I thought we had talked about this, Miley?" Doctor Khauf had intense eyes and a stern voice, but those seemed to have little impact on Miley.</p>
<p>"We did."</p>
<p>He removed the stethoscope from her chest and stood straight with a sigh. "Miley, you are lucky you didn't lose your legs. You need to be more careful."</p>
<p>Miley frowned, not understanding his problem. "I <b>was</b> careful."</p>
<p>Dr. Khauf shook his head, but he didn't seem angry. He moved over to the desk to write some notes in Miley's record. Susan shifted nervously. "Is everything okay with her heart, doctor?"</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. "Yes, everything seems normal. But I can't emphasize enough the importance of keeping Miley away from dangerous situations that could stress her heart. With such a serious history of lightning strikes, it's very important we prevent her from being struck again. And that includes not climbing trees."</p>
<p>Susan nodded eagerly, though she'd heard the same advice from many doctors over the months. After Miley took a 20-foot jump off a tree to save Lilly from being struck by lightning she'd needed serious medical care. Not only had she shattered nearly every bone in her legs, but the lightning had struck her instead, stopping her heart until Lilly's ministrations saved her. The ER doctors after Miley's jump had been too busy fixing her to be concerned about the lightning, and the orthopedic doctors had merely worried about her shattered legs, but every cardiologist and family doctor they'd seen since then had been worried about the strikes. Dr. Khauf had come highly recommended and had been in charge of Miley's care for several months now.</p>
<p>"Not all trees get struck by lightning, Doc," said Miley, not liking where this conversation was going. She'd been out of commission for months and now they were trying to take her tree climbing away, too.</p>
<p>"No, just the ones you're in, I reckon." Dr. Khauf chuckled at his own joke, but then his face turned serious again. "Miley, this is no joke. Lightning strikes do severe damage to the body, damage we often can't see. Any more strikes could do be extremely deleterious to your health; it could potentially kill you."</p>
<p>Miley could think of nothing to say.</p>
