<!-- This Time Around \ Part Six: The Blonde Bomb Squad -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Cafeteria***</p>
<p>Sam led Faith to the table she and her friends sat at everyday, every
year. It may sound redundant to others, but it was their table, some
sort of control in a place where no control was to be had. "So,
how's the day going so far Faith?" Lily asked as soon as the two
brunettes were sitting down.</p>
<p>"Well just call me chop liver." Sam grumbled under her breath,
completely unaware that with her slayer hearing Faith had heard her.</p>
<p>"I've been through worse.not much worse, but worse." Faith smirked
and leaned over so that she was right next to Sam's ear, "chop
liver." Surprised, not only that Faith was whispering in her ear,
but that the other brunette had heard her, Sam swung her head around,
and came nose to nose with one Faith Spencer.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Sam managed to squeak out, being this close to Faith was
doing something funny to her. Her normally dizzying vocabulary, her
one weapon in a fight, was knocked down to the vocab of a six year
old. She couldn't think of one witty think to say. Not to mention
her heart suddenly decided to vacate the premises and was trying to
beat out of her chest.</p>
<p>Faith was about to respond, repeat really, when three blonds strolled
up like the owned the place, little did she know, they did.</p>
<p>"Oh lookey ah think we have found the lost new kihd." Marry Cherry
said excitedly. Almost going as far as clapping her hands together.
Sam had never been so happy to see Brook and cronies as she was right
now.</p>
<p>"Why I think you're right Mary Cherry. So new kid." Nicole took a
look over Faith's attire, and smirked. "we have a few things to get
straight with you. First." Nicole trailed off as Faith stood and
looked down on her.</p>
<p>"Let me guess.this is your school. You don't like me. Um.oh yeah
there's a list of places I'm not to be seen.Am I right?" Faith
asked, all honest curiosity. It completely threw Nicole, Mary
Cherry, and even Brook for a loop. She had never seen anyone talk to
Nicole like that and live long. "Listen Twinkie, I don't care about
your stupid little rules you probably spent years coming up with.
I'm here `cause I want to be, and you," Faith poked Nicole in the
chest, "ain't gonna do nothin' to ruin it for me." And with that
Faith sat down, seven very stunned faces stared at her.</p>
<p>Nicole opened her mouth to say somethin, closed it, opened it again,
and then stormed off, Mary Cherry hot on her heels. "Welcome to
Kennedy High." Brook said with a smirk of her own as she went after
Nicole to make sure she wasn't planning something that involved death.
or mayhem, that was bad too.</p>
<p>"Your like.like.I don't know but it's supper cool!" Lily gushed; she
was coming down with a bad case of hero worship.</p>
<p>"Riiiiggghhhttt.so who was that?" Faith asked pointing behind her
where the threesome had left.</p>
<p>"The last one to leave was Brook, my soon to be stepsister.the one
who you pissed off was Nicole aka Satan, good job by the way.oh and
the first one to talk, that was Mary Cherry, Satan's shadow." Sam
explained, now that Faith wasn't so close to her it was becoming
easier to function.</p>
<p>"Wow, never though I'd meet someone worse than Queen C." Faith mused
to out loud to herself.</p>
<p>"Queen C?" Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"Head cheerleader, and prom queen of ah.my last school. She ain't so
bad anymore though." Faith answered, her mind traveling back to when
she first met the Scooby gang, Cordelia had been the first one to
insult her, well to her face anyway. She respected that. But this
Satan person, seriously had to be put in her place, and she was going
to have fun doing it.</p>
