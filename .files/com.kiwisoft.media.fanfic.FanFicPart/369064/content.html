<p>Everyone seems to really hate Richard, so I guess Im doing my job ;) I'm trying to keep the update regular, but I'm going out of the country for Christmas so I may not get as much time to write. I'll still try for a nice Xmas present for you all though ;)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter VI</b></p>
<p>"Miley, stop fidgeting." Lilly tried to be as quiet as possible so as not to alert the two adults sitting on the sofa to the left of them. Miley stretched across the loveseat they occupied like a cat and turned over so she was face down. Her hip now bumped into Lilly's abdomen and just thinking about how close their respective nether regions were to one another made her blush. Thankfully it was dark in the room.</p>
<p>"This movie is boring," mumbled Miley into the cushion, her face pressed against the side of the loveseat, while she lay stretched across Lilly's lap.</p>
<p>"We're like barely fifteen minutes in; how can you already be bored?" asked Lilly incredulously, then remember who she was talking to. The only times Miley had ever sat through an entire movie had been during her hospital and home confinement when she absolutely couldn't walk. And even then they'd taken multiple breaks in between.</p>
<p>"I wanna go outside," said Miley, her voice muffled through the cushion.</p>
<p>"It's freezing cold and raining." Lilly, who had actually wanted to see the movie, tried to appease Miley while also keeping her eyes trained on the TV.</p>
<p>Miley shifted again, turning her head slightly so she could look at her girlfriend. "Well, that's better than being in here, with Richard."</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes, risking a quick glance at the sofa, where Susan and Richard sat, deeply engrossed in the movie. Lilly didn't know how to convince Miley Richard wasn't evil incarnate, but she could tell the man was trying his best. He even sat with a large gap between Susan and him, just so Miley didn't have to see her mother getting close to another man. She wondered briefly what Miley would be doing if Susan hadn't invited Lilly over for movie night. Probably something to extend her punishment another week, Lilly decided.</p>
<p>Not receiving a response to her statement, Miley turned again, sideways this time, digging her pointy hip into a very sensitive place. Lilly jumped, depositing Miley onto the ground. The thud with which she hit the ground was loud enough for the adults to hear and someone paused the movie and flipped on a light. Susan leaned forward to look at her daughter on the ground, the look on her face one Lilly had dubbed the 'Miley look', for all the times Susan wore it when Miley did something she shouldn't.</p>
<p>"Miley, what are you doing?" Susan sounded almost like she was sighing, but in all honesty she was glad Miley was being her silly, accident-prone self instead of the moping heap of misery she had been without Lilly.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Stewart, Miley won't stop fidgeting and she hit a nerve or something. You know how bony she is."</p>
<p>Miley snorted, knowing full well what nerve she had hit. Unconcerned by her position on the ground, she stretched out farther, enjoying the sliding motion she achieved on the hardwood floor.</p>
<p>Susan exhaled heavily and shook her head. "Miley, can we continue now or are you going to stay down there?"</p>
<p>Miley turned herself in a 360-degree circle on the floor, her face contemplative. Susan suppressed a groan and rubbed a hand across her face. Miley had been so much easier to deal with when she'd had an older brother and father to run around and climb trees with and Susan wished for the umpteenth time her daughter would get along with Richard. He liked the outdoors just as much and had even mentioned to her he'd love to take Miley out for some hiking or climbing.</p>
<p>Miley was still sliding around on the floor, grinning while she made herself dizzy. Susan threw a pillow at her, hitting her square in the face. "Please go make some popcorn or something, Miley. You are driving me insane. Lilly, go with her and keep her indoors, please?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and stood, nudging a still floor-bound Miley with her foot. Miley laughed and let herself be pulled up. She had no desire to use her dreaded crutches and instead wrapped her arms around Lilly's shoulders from behind. Lilly shook her head, but couldn't deny her girlfriend anything. Miley immediately jumped on her back to be carried into the kitchen. They'd done this a lot back when Miley really couldn't walk and Lilly found it actually seemed to calm her girlfriend down.</p>
<p>Miley rested her head on Lilly's shoulder, exhaling deeply as she held onto her girlfriend. Lilly could feel Miley's heart racing against her back. She carried Miley into the kitchen and deposited her on the kitchen counter, while she went to look for the popcorn. Miley watched intently while Lilly went through the pantry and programmed the microwave. Lilly felt the eyes on her, but finished her task before she returned to her girlfriend. She stood between Miley's legs and earned a brilliant smile.</p>
<p>"Lilly, I think you ground me," said Miley, a serious look on her face now.</p>
<p>"At least something does, Road kill." Lilly laughed, but Miley still looked serious and bit her lip, her telltale sign that she was struggling with something. Lilly inclined her head and put her hands on Miley's knees. "What's up, Miles?"</p>
<p>Miley continued to bite her lip, but eventually met Lilly's eyes. "I don't know what I'm gonna do when you leave."</p>
<p>"When I leave? Miles, you're only grounded for two more days. Just don't do anything else to piss off your mom, okay?"</p>
<p>Miley shook her head, the issue pressing on her much more serious. "No, when you leave for good."</p>
<p>Lilly frowned, wondering whether Miley had suddenly acquired psychic powers that could foresee something she herself did not yet know. "Why would I leave for good?"</p>
<p>"When you go away to college and I'll still be here."</p>
<p>"Iâ€¦Mileyâ€¦" Lilly struggled with what to say, wholly unprepared to have this discussion when she thought they'd just continue to dance around it for the next few months. She shook her head, trying to clear it. Miley looked so sad right there in front of her it almost hurt Lilly to see. "I'm never gonna go away, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley looked into Lilly's blue eyes. "Promise?"</p>
<p>Lilly knew she couldn't promise something like that, knew that what she had meant by 'never going away' was probably leagues different from what Miley took it to mean, but how could she look into those eyes and not do whatever was necessary to make them sparkle? "I promise."</p>
<p>Miley smiled and Lilly reciprocated, though the sudden heaviness inside of her made her feel like a traitor. Miley wrapped her arms around Lilly's neck and pulled her even closer. Their lips met, heated and explosive, but always slow and sensual and so completely consuming. Lilly snuck her arms around Miley's waist and they melted together into one. By the time Miley's tongue brushed against hers, Lilly had already forgotten about her precarious promise.</p>

<p>Miley was just trying to maneuver the door open while holding onto her crutches, when someone exited the store and held the door for her. She smiled a 'thanks' and hurried inside to escape the freezing winter air. Her mother was likely watching to ensure she went inside and Miley knew it wouldn't do to dawdle. A blast of warm air and several stares greeted her, but she ignored them as usual and made her way towards the back. People no longer seemed terrified of her and now the only ones to move away were those trying to make room for her to get through. Crowley Corners hadn't changed overnight, but the townspeople seemed to have at least accepted she was not evil incarnate, though few talked to her and even fewer, if any, sought her ought. Miley didn't mind, as long as she had her mom and grandma and Lilly.</p>
<p>The sole general store in Crowley Corners was right out of some 1950's picture book, complete with a curmudgeonly, though secretly very genial, shopkeeper. The shop had updated its inventory over the years, but it certainly could not compare with a big city store of any size, and Crowley's residents liked it that way. The store had that country feel they preferred and any change would likely not go over well.</p>
<p>Miley stopped in the candy aisle, eyes scanning the rows of colorful packages. Though she was still grounded, her mom had reluctantly agreed to take Miley along on her errand run and was even letting Miley pick out one thing for herself.</p>
<p>The choice was tough and Miley knew she better hurry before her mom ended up waiting for her. She rocked back and forth on her crutches, a habit she had developed to stop the antsy feeling in her legs. Someone came into the aisle and Miley looked up when that person actually spoke to her.</p>
<p>"You any safer on those things than you were in the wheelchair?"</p>
<p>Miley looked at George, the shopkeeper, and gave him a toothy grin. "The getaway is quicker."</p>
<p>George shook his head, but he was chuckling. "Well, stay away from my displays, ya hear?"</p>
<p>Miley could only grin sheepishly, remembering the time a few months ago when she'd bumped one of his artfully arranged displays of cereal boxes with her wheelchair. The resulting mess had been news enough to get nearly the whole of Crowley Corners coming out to see. George had pretended to be furious, but Miley had noticed him holding in his laughter, too. Even before her stunt on the lightning tree and the town's change of heart about her, George had always been at least civil towards her, probably owing to the fact he had been a good friend of her dad's before he passed away.</p>
<p>Now George motioned for her to follow him toward the front of the store. "I got somethin' ta show ya. I think you'll like it."</p>
<p>Miley, never one to pass up a mystery, followed George to the front. He went behind the counter, rummaging underneath and eventually set three small items in front of her. Miley's eyes widened with glee as she stared at the objects.</p>
<p>"Tabasco lollipops?" Her face was split by an ear-to-ear grin and George could only shake his head at her excitement over some novelty candy no one else in town would dare come near.</p>
<p>"Tabasco cinnamon. I have no idea if they're any good, since I refuse to put anything that nasty in my mouth, but I thought you might enjoy them."</p>
<p>Miley, head already spinning with images of herself eating the lollipops, reached for the crumpled up bills she had stuffed into her pocket. Thankfully the part of her not daydreaming about Tabasco lollipops awoke, reminding her of something. "Oh, mama told me to get some laundry soap. I'll be in trouble if I forget."</p>
<p>Before she had a chance to turn around, George was already out from behind his counter. "You stay here, I'll go grab it. I don't want you knocking over anything else in my store."</p>
<p>Miley grinned and waited, eyes straying every so often to the tantalizing lollipops still sitting on the counter. Her mouth was watering just thinking about putting one in her mouth. A voice interrupted her thoughts and she turned, surprised at whom she saw.</p>
<p>"Hello, Miley."</p>
<p>"Dr. Khauf, I didn't know you lived in Crowley," said Miley, looking at the source for a lot of her misery in the past few months. She knew that wasn't entirely fair; he wasn't a bad doctor and it certainly wasn't his fault she'd jumped off a tree, but all the restrictions he kept putting on her were driving her mad.</p>
<p>She studied him now, away from their normal setting, and he looked just the same as always. He was tall, but in decent shape, with dark blonde hair graying at the temples and washed-out green eyes. As always, Dr. Khauf was wearing a pastel-colored shirt and tie with slacks, likely picked out by a professional.</p>
<p>He smiled at her, his teeth gleaming in the artificial light. "Oh no, no, but I am considering it. It's very peaceful out here, and not at all a long drive to Murfreesboro."</p>
<p>Miley nodded, not caring much about where he lived or drove to and risked another glance at her lollipops, just to ensure their continued safety. Dr. Khauf, however, wasn't giving up. "I see you're using the crutches, good. I was worried you'd just throw them to the wind and climb the nearest tree."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "I did; I was caught."</p>
<p>Dr. Khauf blinked, clearly unable to tell whether she was joking or not, but eventually decided she must be and laughed. "You're really something, Miley, you know that? You must drive your poor mother insane."</p>
<p>Before Miley could comment, George returned with her laundry soap, ready to ring up her purchase. Dr. Khauf waved off, already turning towards the exit. "It was nice seeing you, Miley; perhaps soon we'll be neighbors." He laughed at his own joke and raised a hand. "Say 'hi' to your mother for me. Bye, Miley."</p>
<p>Miley managed a half-hearted wave goodbye, before she turned her attention back to George and her goodies. The bell over the door jingled, indicating the doctor had left the store. George rang up her purchase and took the crumpled bills from her. "What a funny bird. You know him?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, he's my doctor," said Miley absentmindedly, already unwrapping one of her lollipops.</p>
<p>George offered to carry the soap out to the truck in light of her current predicament and she followed him out of the store. She sat in the truck and waited for her mom, enjoying the delicious combination of Tabasco sauce and cinnamon exploding in her mouth, when she realized Dr. Khauf had left the store without looking at or buying a single thing.</p>

<p>Lilly leaned back in her plastic seat with a sigh, checking her cell phone for the time. Someone ran past her, jostling her elbow and she frowned. The noise level was definitely starting to get to her. Poppy's was the best burger joint not only in Murfreesboro, but probably the entire state, and as a result it was always packed with High Schoolers and college kids. During the warm months, there was a huge patio to sit outside, but now in the winter everyone was crowded into the restaurant's interior, packed into tacky and uncomfortable plastic chairs and booths. The smell of grease hung in the air and though the burgers were absolutely delicious, Lilly preferred eating them either outside or at home.</p>
<p>"Yo, Lilster, you thinking about your girl again?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked at Oliver across from her and rolled her eyes. Half his face was smeared with ketchup and mustard while he laughed at her. Lilly didn't know how Sarah, his girlfriend currently seated beside him, wasn't constantly wearing a look of utter embarrassment.</p>
<p>"I'm thinking about how much longer it can possibly take you to finish your food," she responded, flicking a ketchup packet at him. He was already stuffing his mouth again and therefore merely shrugged, unperturbed by her obvious desire to leave.</p>
<p>She hadn't really wanted to come in the first place, but had been won over by the celebratory spirit of the end of the semester. All three of them had taken their last test today and over two weeks of freedom loomed ahead, so Oliver and Sarah had talked Lilly into driving them all to Murfreesboro for some of Poppy's burgers. They'd even told her to invite Miley, but her girlfriend was stuck at home under Grandma Ruby's strict schooling and would not be granted her freedom for another hour.</p>
<p>At least Oliver seemed close to being done with his burger. Lilly played with some leftover fries, watching the multitude of customers come in and out, when something caught her eye. The restaurant wasn't huge, but was divided into two sections by a half-wall painted in obnoxious colors. On the other side of the restaurant Lilly noticed someone that looked an awful lot like Richard, sitting at a table across from a young, pretty woman. They looked to be engaged in a heated argument, the woman leaning across the table with her finger pointing at Richard. He, too, looked furious, with drawn eyebrows and a red face. Lilly realized she had never really seen him angry before, despite all the things Miley had said and done and wondered who this woman could be to get him so heated.</p>
<p>Sarah followed her gaze. "Hey, isn't that the guy dating Mrs. Stewart?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." Lilly nodded absentmindedly, unable to draw her eyes away from Richard and his female companion.</p>
<p>"Who's that woman he's with? They look angry."</p>
<p>Lilly wanted to roll her eyes; Sarah had a tendency to be nosy, but she couldn't exactly throw stones when she herself was watching the two adults. "I don't know."</p>
<p>"Maybe he's cheating," said Sarah, eager for any bit of gossip she could spread around town.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't think Richard was a cheater, but his presence here, with this woman, was suspicious. She remembered him clearly saying last night at the Stewarts' he had to go to Nashville today for business. Miley had made some sort of comment about a travelling physical therapist, but Lilly had ignored it, as she did most of her girlfriend's comments concerning Richard. She didn't think she would tell Miley about this, though, knowing it would only add fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>"Are we gonna leave?" Oliver's whine pulled Lilly from her reverie and she turned her attention back to her two friends. She wanted to say something about having only been waiting for him, but she was still too confused about seeing Richard to come up with anything.</p>
<p>She pushed her chair back and stood. "Let's go. I gotta get a milkshake and burger first though."</p>
<p>Oliver made a face, clearly not happy to have to wait now that he was ready. "Are you serious? You <b>just</b> ate, fatty."</p>
<p>Lilly rolled her eyes. "For Miley, dumbass. You guys can wait outside if you want, I won't be long."</p>
<p>"You're such a good girlfriend," said Sarah sincerely, probably dreaming of a day when her own significant other started thinking about someone other than himself.</p>
<p>Lilly left them to go to the counter and ordered her food. She moved off to the side to wait for her order, but when she turned, Richard was right in front of her. Lilly took a step back, her heart suddenly pounding and for a moment Miley's crazy conspiracy theories invaded her mind. Then Richard smiled at her and Lilly exhaled, feeling stupid.</p>
<p>"Hey there, Lilly. I didn't know you liked this place."</p>
<p>"Best burgers in Tennessee, right? Some friends and I just came to celebrate the beginning of winter break." Lilly felt nervous for some reason, but attributed it to meeting someone she knew but didn't have much interaction with in a new setting.</p>
<p>Richard pointed towards the counter. "You bringing some back for Miley?" He chuckled when Lilly nodded. "That's gotta be a welcome relief for her after suffering through schoolwork all morning."</p>
<p>The woman Lilly had seen with him earlier suddenly stepped into her view and Richard turned to her. She was even prettier up close, with light brown hair, brilliant blue eyes and porcelain skin. Her outfit was impeccable and very professional. It made Lilly feel shabby somehow. The woman scrutinized Lilly with an intense look.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lilly, this is my sister, Mandy. Mandy, this is Lilly, Miley's girlfriend," said Richard, smiling easily. The woman's demeanor changed so abruptly Lilly almost wondered if she'd imagined the icy stare. Mandy smiled and held out her hand for Lilly to shake. Lilly returned the smile and handshake easily.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you had a sister," said Lilly before she could stop herself. She hadn't meant to sound so skeptical.</p>
<p>"Oh, he's a horrible brother, I know; I hardly get to see him now he's dating Susan. Well, it was nice to meet you, Lilly. Hopefully I can meet Miley sometime soon, as well; Richard's told me so much about her," said Mandy, practically gushing with sincerity.</p>
<p>Lilly said 'goodbye' with as much enthusiasm as she could muster and watched Richard and his sister leaving the restaurant. They called her number almost right after and she grabbed Miley's food, now more ready to leave than ever. But all she could think about on her walk back to her car, was that she had never seen a brother and sister look less alike than those two.</p>
