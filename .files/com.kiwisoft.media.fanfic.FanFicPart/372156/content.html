<P>a/n: fourth chapter…yup…I'm liking it so far I think…</P><P>I hope it's a little different then others you've read…I just really like the whole Tennessee thing…</P><P>Chapter Four: Dream</P><P>'God, I can't believe I groped Lilly. When she was naked! And wet! …oh god, dirty thoughts.' I frowned to myself, then noticed Lilly noticing me as I lurked awkwardly by the kitchen door wondering if I should go over and apologize to her for what happened…her mom did leave, but oh god. I feel like such a loser, I turned quickly feeling my face turning red, I pushed open the kitchen door.</P><P>"Oh hey, there you are Miley. I need you to give this omelet to old Mr. Watson over at table five, and then give this pitcher of orange juice to the rowdy family at table three. And see if that lonely little girl who's mama doesn't seem too nice to her if she's hungry, okay?" Mama shoo'ed me over to the plate with the omelet and the pitcher as she flipped more omelets on the skillet.</P><P>"Alright mama…but what girl?" The only girl alone out there is Lilly…</P><P>"The cute little blonde girl, darlin' the only girl out there alone." She laughed.</P><P>'Crap,' I whined to myself and grabbed a little note pad off the counter that I shoved in my back pocket of my jeans while I grabbed the omelet and orange juice, kicking the door open I made my way slowly around the room giving out the food and orange juice, making sure everybody else was pleased with their food or wanted any more…of course they didn't want more, so I told myself to quit stalling and walk over to Lilly. 'It was just a grope! An accidental grab…nothing more.' I walked up to her, "Uh, hey there…" I said awkwardly.</P><P>She glanced up, looking at little upset. "Oh Miley, hey."</P><P>"Are you okay?" I really was concerned.</P><P>"Yeah, I'm okay…just wondering what I'm going to do for the next month alone here."</P><P>"Well, uh," I sat down in the chair her mother had been sitting in earlier, "You could spend some time with me if you want."</P><P>She smiled slowly, "Only if you don't grope me again."</P><P>I turned red, "I'm real sorry 'bout that…I, uh, just had to pee…I didn't do that on purpose I swear."</P><P>"It was pretty awkward, I'm not going to lie."</P><P>'Does that mean she doesn't like me? Or…like girls for that matter…I mean, sure it was awkward…but mostly just embarrassing…oh gosh.' I thought in panic.</P><P>"But I'd love if you'd keep me entertained for the month, just no more free gropes." She laughed a little.</P><P>"Okay, I'd like that." I smiled, "Wait…I mean, I wasn't trying to get a free feel! I swear!" I said a little too loudly, as the family from table three looked at me all at once, I continued a little more quietly, "I'm sorry, honestly. Won't happen again."</P><P>"Miley, I'm joking…really don't touch my boobs again, but it's fine. By the way, I'm hungry. Did you come over here to take my order or cause a scene?" She joked.</P><P>"T-take your order." I stumbled over my words, she just said boobs. I feel like a twelve year old boy who just realized girls are attractive for the first time. "What would you like?"</P><P>"Well, what would you recommend? My mom said something about omelets…are they good?"</P><P>"Good 'nough, I mean I probably eat 'em at least twice a week…may more, sometimes Travis 'nd I have these omelet eating contests…those end rather badly though, be sure not to come around during those." I chuckled, remembering last time when Travis ended up trying not to puke up omelet all over the place.</P><P>"Omelet eating contests with…Travis huh?" She glanced at the menu, and if I was correct it looked like she was feigning interest in it so she wouldn't sound too curious about him, "So is he your boyfriend?" She finished.</P><P>I grinned, maybe she was interested. "Oh no, Travis? He's a friend that's a boy…but he's no significant other to me. Just a friend, oh wouldn't my mama love if he was my boyfriend though. He'd love it too. But 'bout them omelets, I'd just get an Original one…with ham and cheese in it. I like those best, they aren't fancy but…they're good."</P><P>"Sounds good," She nodded her head, "I'll get one of those and some coffee."</P><P>"Great." I smiled again, "And later after I clean up here do you want to meet me over at the stables? Maybe we can go riding or something."</P><P>"Sounds good." She said again.</P><P>"Great." I nodded, walking away. 'Oh, slick moves Miley…you're such a dork you know.' I kicked open the kitchen door, "Mama, can I start with dishes? Lilly just wants an Original omelet and a cuppa coffee."</P><P>"Oh okay, darlin' how about you just head down to the stables and help your Daddy with the horses I'll finish up around here." She said as she started cracking eggs into a bowl for Lilly's omelet.</P><P>"Alright, thanks mama." I ran over and gave her a hug, then left out the back door to go to the stables.</P><P>"Miley!" I heard Daddy shout from inside one of the horse stalls, "Is that you?"</P><P>"Yeah Daddy, I was just going to saddle up Bluejeans and 'Girl." I hollered back.</P><P>"Hold up with that, get in here! I think Cinnamon is about to have her foal!"</P><P>I ran towards the stall where he was yelling from, "Oh really! Great, should I call the vet?" I asked.</P><P>"Already did, now get in here and keep her calm." He nodded towards her as the first signs the foal was coming out started, with a hoof showing. "I've only seen this one hoof coming out…I don't know where the other one is at."</P><P>"Aw, oh Cinny. Are you going to have to get in there and see where it is?" I asked worried, she never was good at giving birth…but she did have some good foals.</P><P>"I might, I really want to wait on the vet…but I can't wait that long or the foal with sufficate…" He glanced at me worried too, "Maybe get the vet on the phone. You know how Dr. Todd is, can hardly get off his butt in the morning for something important."</P><P>"Alright daddy," I got out my cell phone, since I had his number in it too and dialed his number. "Hey, Dr. Todd, this is Miley. Yeah Daddy and I were wondering how long 'till you're out here…Okay…Yeah, the foal's hoof…we only see one, we don't know where the other is…Alright…Okay, yeah…See you soon." I hung up.</P><P>"What'd he say?"</P><P>"Uh, he'll be here in thirty minutes, he was actually doing something at his office right now. He said stick your hand in there and pull the other leg out forward, cause its probably just pushed back in there like last time." I frowned, walking over to Cinnamon, "Poor baby, I hope it's okay."</P><P>"Yeah, me too." He rolled his sleeve up, "Well, here goes nothing…"</P><P>"Gross," I whispered to Cinnamon, not looking at Daddy who looked pretty disgusted right now. "You should tell your babies to stop giving us so much trouble when they decide it's time to come out."</P><P>"Got it!" He hollered, "Wooo, that was easier than last time!" He shook gunk off his arm from Cinnamon. "Now come on little foal, come on outta there."</P><P>Then, plop, before we knew it there was another new little baby in the stall with us. Daddy kneeled down beside it to check the gender, "A little filly. Okay now untie her, Miles. Let her see the baby." I unhooked the tied up lead and stepped back quickly, not getting between her and the baby.</P><P>"She's adorable!" I heard a nervous voice behind us.</P><P>I looked to see who it was, "Oh hey Lilly! Yeah, ain't she? Cinny always has some pretty babies." I grinned.</P><P>"You better not go and name this one 'Filly'…" Lilly muttered at me.</P><P>Daddy laughed, "So you heard about her naming problem? Yeah, don't worry…we've already got a Colt, and she tried to name the other filly 'Filly' we had a year and a half ago here but she got a proper name instead."</P><P>Lilly smiled at him, "Oh that's good, what'd you name her?"</P><P>"Girl." I said.</P><P>"What? That's not a proper name!" Lilly sounded disgusted.</P><P>"She's jokin', her names Cowgirl…which isn't much of a horse name but…that's Miley's naming for you. It's better than 'Filly' I told her."</P><P>Lilly rolled her eyes, "Well I think I should name this one."</P><P>"Buut…I wanted to name her…" I whined.</P><P>"What'd you have in mind?" She asked skeptically.</P><P>"Uh…Horse…"</P><P>"No." Lilly and Daddy said at the same time.</P><P>I pouted, "Fine Lilly you can name her…." Not that I really wanted to name her, I just wanted to mess with Lilly.</P><P>"I'll think of a good name for her." Lilly stated, looking at me.</P><P>"I sure hope so," Daddy said. "'Cause don't count on her mama or me to have a good name for it either…her mama names everything after spices or cooking stuff. That's where old Cinnamon got her name. She tried to name a little white colt we had a few years back 'Flour' even." He shook his head, "You better be glad we named you and your brother real names and not after food or clothes."</P><P>I laughed at him, "But I love old Blue, it fits so good."</P><P>Lilly looked as if she was about to question the sanity of my family.</P><P>a/n: oh so…weird ending but hey, sorry I didn't know if I was talking about the horses too much or what…sorry I get going and I can't stop. I don't know much about horses actually…I know about cows, so I'm just changing all my knowledge of cow births and what not into horses haha. So if any of you actually do know about horses and my knowledge of them is insulting sorry…I only know people ride them and they're nice looking animals. Haha :)</P><P>tell me if you think too much animals not enough whatever else you'd like to see more of. I'm trying to make this more of a story…not just lilly and miley and some more miley and lilly. But if it's not going too hot, just say something I'll keep it in mind. Thanks for reading.</P>
