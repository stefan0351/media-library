<!-- During The Down Time \ null -->

<p>Tara was startled awake as the heavy book landed on her chest suddenly. Blinking her eyes a few times she laughed lightly as she realized what had happened. </p>

		<p>"So much for neural anatomy." She laughed again as she eased the thick volume up and let it drop with a thump to the floor. Rolling over onto her tummy, she snuggled herself into the pillow. "Might as well do some in depth study of dreams." She murmured as she let her eyes drift closed again.</p>

		<p>She didn't know how much time had gone by, but somewhere in the middle of a very odd dream about Willow and ice cream she was awoken by a loud clear knock. As she pulled herself up and ran a quick hand through her hair she moved quickly to the door. </p>

		<p>A glance out the small security glass gave her the most depressing picture as a very dishevelled and rain drenched Slayer stood shivering on the other side.</p>

		<p>"Buffy?" Tara undid the lock and quickly pulled the door open. </p>

		<p>"Hey." Buffy tried an optimistic smile when she saw her best friend's girlfriend at the door. "I'm sorry, I woke you didn't I?" She gave the tall blonde a once over seeing her ruffled clothes and tangled hair.</p>

		<p>"I fell asleep studying, no great loss." Tara held onto the door and then remembering the wood under her fingers shook her head to wake herself. "P-Please come in." She backed away and watched the Slayer step tentatively in.</p>

		<p>"I didn't mean to barge in, I just needed to talk to Willow." Buffy cupped her hands around the opposite elbow.</p>

		<p>"She's at the library, study group. Her group has to come up with a viable economic structure for a utopian society by tomorrow." Tara bit her lip as she closed the door. "She should be home in an hour or so if you want to stay."</p>

		<p>"No, I should let you get back to your studying." Buffy shook her head but didn't move towards the door. "Just wanted to moan to her about another chapter in the pathetic and depressing life of Buffy Summers."</p>

		<p>Tara nodded uncomfortably as she moved back towards the sink and plugged in the small kettle that Willow kept in her room. </p>

		<p>"I mean you think you know somebody. Think after being with them, sleeping with them and sharing all your time with them you'd know how likely it was for them to stab you in the back? Cheat on you and then turn around and blame you for it all?" Buffy didn't know where her voice came from as the things that were spinning around her mind were given voice. "I mean men, where the hell do you think they get their brains? Oh wait what brains." She didn't truly realize how much she'd said until her hands hit the soft fabric of the comforter on the bed as she sat down. "Sorry, the last thing you want to waste your time talking about is men." She looked down feeling infinitely stupid.</p>

		<p>"B-Buffy, if you need to talk…" Tara poured out two cups of coffee and made her way over to the bed as she handed the Slayer one of the cups. "I-I'm a good listener, even about man trouble." One side of her mouth curled up into a smirk.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry." Buffy shook her head again as she looked down into the cup. "I have this little known Slayer ability called insert one foot, remove and then insert the other." She looked to the blonde and frowned before looking back into the coffee.</p>

		<p>"No foot insertions." Tara smiled broader at her. "All lesbians have to take classes on how to have long conversations about men with their heterosexual friends." </p>

		<p>Buffy's head came up slowly as she looked at the witch in disbelief. </p>

		<p>"Touché." Buffy laughed and smiled for the first time. </p>

		<p>"So come on, as Willow says I demand full spillage." She did her best imitation of her redheaded girlfriend. "His name is Riley and…"</p>

		<p>"I thought I knew him." Buffy's face fell again. "I mean I thought it could work. He knew I was the Slayer, accepted all that that entailed. Hell, it even turned him on I think." </p>

		<p>"Well you are a beautiful, intelligent woman Buffy." Tara smiled at the Slayer, praying she wouldn't take the comment in a bad way. </p>

		<p>"Thank you." The Slayer smiled back at her. "But if that was a pass I'm going to have to first chastise you for cheating on my best friend and secondly for trying to take advantage of a vulnerable and distraught woman."</p>

		<p>"I have only the most virtuous intentions." Tara laughed lightly. </p>

		<p>"Well that's disappointing in a way." Buffy laughed with her. "First Riley cheats on me with a vamp and now I'm not even attractive to other women."</p>

		<p>"You know what you need." Tara put her cup on the floor and stood up.</p>

		<p>"If you say anything that doesn't involve ice cream and lots of wallowing I'm not sure I'm up for it." Buffy answered honestly.</p>

		<p>"Well that's tonight." Tara smiled. "But tomorrow night we need to have a girl's night out. A let your hair down and forget your troubles." </p>

		<p>"I don't know." Buffy shook her head a little surprised the suggestion was coming from her best friend's very shy and very reserved girlfriend.</p>

		<p>"Look B-Buffy…" Tara felt her confidence wane a bit but she took a deep breath to keep up her courage as she sat back down. "I know we don't know each other too well but after the whole thing with my Dad…"</p>

		<p>"I meant what I said Tara." The Slayer's voice was soft and honest.</p>

		<p>"I know you did." Tara nodded. "That's why I want to show you that I can be here for you now. I would never try to replace Willow, she's your best friend and I totally respect that but if you ever need an ear to stand in for her?"</p>

		<p>"You'll be one of the first people I turn too." Buffy reached out and patted the other blonde's arm. "Tara, I know I haven't come across as the most understanding and open minded person sometimes but I really, really am happy that Willow found you and that you and I have this chance to be friends."</p>

		<p>"Me too." Tara barely got the words out before the Slayer engulfed her in a happy appreciative hug.</p>

		<p>"Hey am I supposed to be jealous here?" Willow's smiling voice called them out of the embrace from the doorway.</p>

		<p>"All depends?" Buffy for the first time felt her playful side unhindered by a fear that she'd say the wrong thing to her Wiccans. </p>

		<p>"On what?" Willow dropped her knapsack on the floor and mockingly folded her arms over her chest. </p>

		<p>"If you don't mind Tara's hand being on my butt?" The Slayer laughed and was glad to hear both the Wiccans join in. </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Willow snuggled in closer to the body beside her as she fought the heaviness in her eyes.</p>

		<p>"So you and Buffy seemed mighty chummy this evening." Willow prompted softly before finishing the sentence with a yawn.</p>

		<p>"Yeah." Tara smiled as she brushed her fingers into red hair. </p>

		<p>"Soooo?" She prompted again.</p>

		<p>"I think her and I finally found a common ground." Tara bent down and kissed her lover's lips softly. "Now go to sleep you sleepy head, you have a big presentation tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"I'm glad you two were able to talk tonight." Willow yawned again. "Does my little heart good to know my two favourite girls are getting along." </p>

		<p>"Yeah." Tara closed her eyes and snuggled in closer. "Does my heart good too."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy stood apart from the line up going into the club looking down both sides of the street for the approach of her friends. A quick and thorough patrol had facilitated her coming straight here.</p>

		<p>'I'm going to forget Riley and have a good time.' She repeated her new mantra as she noticed Willow and Tara emerge hand in hand around the closest corner. 'I'm going to forget Riley and have a good time.'</p>

		<p>"Hey." She waved enthusiastically.</p>

		<p>"Sorry we're late." Willow blushed slightly as they got closer. "We…" She stopped and looked at her girlfriend for a heartbeat before turning back to Buffy. </p>

		<p>"No worries." Buffy forced herself to keep smiling. "The vamps kept me busy so I just got here a few minutes ago." She took a deep breath. "Look if you two would rather have a nice couples evening, I can take my chances with the Friday late night movie."</p>

		<p>"No way." Willow shook her head and Tara mimicked her. "From this moment on we're just three carefree and fancy girls out for a night to remember." For effect she let go of Tara's hand. "Right Tar bear?"</p>

		<p>"Right." Tara nodded. "So we should line up?" She pointed to the growing line.</p>

		<p>Buffy only nodded as she followed them to the back again repeating her mantra to gain the strength to do this.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>As she breathlessly sat down Buffy realized that despite herself she was having a good time. A few well-mixed virgin pina coladas and even more time dancing had lifted many of her more immediate trouble for the moment.</p>

		<p>"Before I forget I wanted to say thank you to you both." Buffy reached across the table and squeezed their hands. </p>

		<p>"Thank you?" Tara looked at her a little thrown by the comment.</p>

		<p>"For taking me out, showing me a good time." She winked at them both. "Shall I get us another round?" A group of enthusiastic nods sent her bouncing off towards the bar.</p>

		<p>"She's either faking really well or she's actually having a good time." Willow reached under the table and squeezed her girlfriend's knee. </p>

		<p>"I go with the latter, not even the Slayer could fake for this long." Tara reached down and put her hand over Willow's. "Hey none of that now." She laughed and removed it. "This is Buffy's night."</p>

		<p>"Well aren't you the resolved one." The hacker laughed and put her hand back on the table. "Not like I need to be told I'm loved." She pulled a sad and pouting face.</p>

		<p>"You are such a vixen." Tara laughed as she leaned over and quickly kissed the redhead's cheek.</p>

		<p>"Tara, I didn't expect to see you tonight." A soft light voice broke the moment as a slim woman about the same height as the blonde wiccan appeared suddenly at the table. Her long brown hair sat straight and wispy to bounce around her shoulders. </p>

		<p>"Nicole!" Tara turned surprised at the sound of her friend's voice. "I didn't know you were coming here either." She stood up and the girl's exchanged a brief hug. "Nicole, this is my girlfriend Willow." She grinned at the redhead and reached back for her hand. She felt so lucky to able to make the introduction.</p>

		<p>"Hi Nicole." Willow smiled at the brunette. "Nice to meet you."</p>

		<p>"I've heard so much about you." Nicole smiled brightly back. "It's nice to finally meet you too."</p>

		<p>"Where's Chris?" Tara motioned for her to take one of the empty seats as she took a brief look around.</p>

		<p>"I don't know." Nicole shook her head trying not to lose her smile. "We broke up."</p>

		<p>"Oh no." Tara's face dropped instantly. "What happened?" She tried to get insight into her friend's dilemma when the Slayer arrived back with their drinks.</p>

		<p>"You won't believe how much hassle you get when you ask for a virgin drink." Buffy arrived laughing though she instantly noticed the tone of the table was sombre suddenly. </p>

		<p>"Nothing important." Nicole answered quickly before she impulsively turned to Buffy. "I can vouch, I had ten invitations to be deflowered by the time the bartender had poured this." She held up her frothy fruit drink.</p>

		<p>"I only got six." Buffy laughed as she sat down to fill the last seat at the table.</p>

		<p>"Well gentlemen prefer blonde's…" Nicole shot her a sly wink. "But low life college scum have no taste."</p>

		<p>"Don't I know it!" Buffy snorted and took a sip of her drink. </p>

		<p>"Buffy this is my friend Nicole." Tara waited for a lull in the two girls impromptu conversation. "She goes to the college too."</p>

		<p>"Psychology major, minor in Fine Arts." The brunette smiled before taking a sip of her drink. </p>

		<p>"Undeclared." Buffy countered with a slight grin. </p>

		<p>"Isn't it funny how we all suddenly become our major. No more silly names or personality traits." Willow piped in. "Just 'computer science', 'economics', 'psychology' and such."</p>

		<p>"I guess that's why college is so much about finding out who you are." Nicole nodded at the hacker's babble. "But the real irony is that you spend so much time trying to figure out who you really are and all you come up with in the end is the same things you've always known."</p>

		<p>"And along the way you spend tones of time trying to figure out other people and how hopefully you'll be able to change so that they'll fit into your life." Buffy turned in her chair as she met with the other girl's philosophy.</p>

		<p>"Only to find out that if you needed to change to have them fit there was no way they were ever going to fit because you should never have to change." Nicole filled in another line to their growing debate as Willow and Tara shrunk away from the conversation.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Do you get the feeling that we're invisible?" Willow leaned over and whispered in the blonde's ear.</p>

		<p>"Definitely." Tara turned to whisper back. "Though it seems to have made them both forget about there love lives."</p>

		<p>"Which was our goal this evening so congratulations." Willow kissed behind the blonde's ear secretively. </p>

		<p>"And congratulations to you." Tara squirmed under the attention happily. </p>

		<p>"Would this pretty lady like to dance?" Willow took her hand softly. "I don't think Buffy will be upset if we leave her to her philosophy of life conversation."</p>

		<p>"Lead on my love." Tara slipped off her stool.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy took the last of her drink in a slow swig when they finally reached a lull in the conversation.</p>

		<p>"Can I get you another?" Nicole motioned to her glass. "We could do a study on the number of invitations we get now that the crowd is likely to be a little drunker."</p>

		<p>"No, I think I'm all drunk out." Buffy shook her head. "I should probably see where my two favourite Wiccans have gotten off too."</p>

		<p>"Dancing." Nicole motioned towards the dance floor a sweet smile on her face. "They look gorgeous together."</p>

		<p>"They do." Buffy turned to follow her eyes and nodded. "They are a perfect example of our theory of perfect fit."</p>

		<p>"A extra perfect fit those two." Nicole played with the plastic stick in her drink.</p>

		<p>"Two of the lucky ones." Buffy agreed again. </p>

		<p>"Do you think if we sighed loud enough our perfect fits would arrive?" Nicole forced herself to look away from the dance floor.</p>

		<p>"Hey, hey now no gloom." Buffy tried to keep a strong face as she too turned from the watching the dance floor. "And you are an absolutely beautiful, intelligent and incredibly witty woman. You deserve the best fit, you just have to have faith."</p>

		<p>"So do you Buffy." Nicole felt her mouth curl up into a sweet smile. "So do you." She patted the Slayer's hand lightly.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>The night was brisk and clear as the foursome chatted their way across the streets of Sunnydale on their way back towards the campus. </p>

		<p>"Well this is our cut off." Tara pulled on the hacker's hand to bring them to a stop.
		</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah." Willow stopped her babbling about celestial configurations and looked down the path.</p>

		<p>"I'm this way." Nicole pointed off to the path that led across the campus.</p>

		<p>"Lucky break for us both." The Slayer looked across the dark paths and her instinct to protect the innocence kick in. Her pesky vamp friends had been making the campus a favourite place for late night snacks and she'd never be able to live with herself if Nicole became one of those snacks on the way home. "I'm that way too." She gave Willow and Tara a brief look to ask them to cover for her. </p>

		<p>"Cool." Nicole nodded. "Tara, I'll see you in class and it was really nice to finally meet you Willow." </p>

		<p>"Talk to you tomorrow." Buffy waved an absent hand at them as the two girls walked off.</p>

		<p>"It must be so hard being the Slayer." Tara frowned slightly as she and Willow began down their path. "Never being able to go off duty."</p>

		<p>"I think she finds it helpful when she's hurting." Willow admitted sadly. "Gives her a way to turn everything off without anyone questioning what she's doing."</p>

		<p>"Her and Nicole meeting up was good timing in a bad timing way." Tara observed pointing out another grouping of stars.</p>

		<p>"That's Orion." Willow filled in the fact before she continued. "Totally, in a bad timing at a good time way. How long had Nicole been going out with Chris?"</p>

		<p>"A few months I think. Nicole really thought they were meant for each other." Tara squeezed the hand in her own tighter. "But Chris and her were from different worlds."</p>

		<p>"Nicole seems so down to earth and normal." Willow kept one eye on the stars and the other on her girlfriend's gorgeous face. "I guess Chris was a wild boy was he? All dark and broody and mysterious?"</p>

		<p>"Wild b-boy?" Tara stopped walking suddenly and looked at the redhead. "Willow, Chris is short for Christine."</p>

		<p>"Christine?" Willow stopped with her. "Oh, I thought…" She didn't finish the stupid thought. "Now I feel really stupid. I mean it's the type of thing ones suppose to pick up on right…" She closed her eyes feeling even stupider. "I mean…" She stopped finally.</p>

		<p>"Will, it's okay." Tara hugged her tight. "I don't think any of us ever specified that Chris was a Christine and there is no way to know if someone is gay just by looking at them." </p>

		<p>"Now I know how easily Buffy starts to feel like she's said something stupid." Willow hugged her girlfriend tighter. </p>

		<p>"You are so lovely." Tara laughed as she held on. </p>

		<p>"Oh no." Willow pulled back suddenly. "If I thought Chris was a guy, Buffy must think Chris is a guy and if Nicole…" She couldn't finish the sentence.</p>

		<p>"Willow, it's okay." Tara continued to laugh as she brushed a stray lock of hair off the redhead's face. "I know Nicole well enough to know she wouldn't do something stupid like hit on Buffy and even if she was stupid enough to on principal the fact that Buffy mentioned Riley about a hundred and fifty times would be a big tip off not too."</p>

		<p>"Sorry, just a bit of worry there." Willow smiled under the attention. "I know if Buffy was to end up saying something innocently stupid she'd be the one who felt the worst."</p>

		<p>"Come on my silly girl." Tara grabbed the hacker's hand and pulled her towards home. "Buffy will be fine." </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"So then Mr. Macho runs to open the door for me and wham…" Buffy laughed so hard she could barely finish the story. "Someone opened the door from the inside and it laid him out cold."</p>

		<p>"That must have been hilarious." Nicole held her side as she laughed. "Men can be so stupid sometimes."</p>

		<p>"Yeah." Buffy took a deep breath as she tried to get her laughing under control. "But I've bored you with enough old stories about my old boyfriend, what about Chris?"</p>

		<p>"Well Chris had this thing about cooking." Nicole started to laugh. "Claimed it was the devils work. Until one morning I wake up to smoke all over the apartment and Chris hopping around the kitchen in a pair of flaming oven mitts."</p>

		<p>"And what did she say?" Buffy stressed the word 'she' carefully. She'd watched Nicole play around with her wordings all night but it struck her that it was time to clear the air. Especially since it really wasn't a big deal. She was cool with these things.</p>

		<p>"She said…" Nicole's voice was a bit weak but the look of acceptance on Buffy's face made her keep going. "She said the fire wasn't her fault, how was she supposed to know that oven mitts weren't fire retardant."</p>

		<p>"That sounds like a line I'd use." Buffy laughed hard. </p>

		<p>"It's a good line." Nicole laughed with her until they broke into a comfortable silence. "So what gave Christine away?"</p>

		<p>"Dunno." Buffy shrugged. "It's cool though, I mean I was a bit of an idiot when Willow and Tara got together but I'm coming along."</p>

		<p>"It comes as a bit of a shock sometimes." Nicole nodded. "You should have seen how much of an idiot I was when I figured out I was gay." She gave the Slayer a bright grin.</p>

		<p>"So how did you know?" Buffy asked the typical but serious question.</p>

		<p>"Honest answer?" Nicole gave her a sly glance as they walked. </p>

		<p>"Of course." Buffy nodded.</p>

		<p>"It was simply really, no life changing dramatic event or anything. I was picking out my university courses with my high school boyfriend and I looked between him and the book about a hundred times and I realised there was a reason going so far away from him wasn't bothering me." Nicole shrugged lightly. "I loved him yes, but not passion love, friend love. I would never dare take risks with him, never really would have ever laid my heart or my soul on the line for him. The only people I had ever done that for were women, all friends of course." She made a slight grimace. "But I think I understand now that in my own silent way I was in love with each of them."</p>

		<p>"Very deep moment." Buffy nodded thoughtfully. </p>

		<p>"Yeah." Nicole shoved her hands deep in the pockets of her jeans. "It's been really great talking to you Buffy but this is my stop." She pointed to a small red brick apartment building across the street. </p>

		<p>"You too." The Slayer crossed her arms over her chest suddenly not knowing what to do with them. "I'll see you on campus then." She felt herself smile a little too enthusiastically as the brunette smiled back and made her way across the street.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Willow waved to the Slayer as she crossed the magic shop and slipped into the empty seat across from her at the round table.</p>

		<p>"I know I'm late." Buffy apologized immediately. </p>

		<p>"Let me guess, you and Dawn, one new cardigan and a lot of name calling." Willow laughed.</p>

		<p>"Are you adding mind reading to your list of skills?" Buffy laughed with her.</p>

		<p>"No, Dawn called the shop to tell us what a cruel big sister you were being." The hacker sipped at her drink.</p>

		<p>"Typical." Buffy rolled her eyes. "So anything on the Hellmouth front?" </p>

		<p>"Nope." Willow shook her head. "Giles and I have no explanation for the sudden lack of demon activity, though the continuation of the regular vampy presence is soothing."</p>

		<p>"In a strange way yeah it is. Though I could use a big scary ten headed lizard thing, just to take my mind off Riley." Buffy leaned down on the book in front just long enough to have her Watcher huff and pull it out from under her chin to reshelve it. "Hi to you too Giles."</p>

		<p>"Good afternoon." Giles nodded. "Anything interesting on patrol?"</p>

		<p>"Nope, dusted a few fledglings but nothing noteworthy." Buffy shook her head as he moved away.</p>

		<p>"I hope last night helped for a few hours." Willow smiled hopefully.</p>

		<p>"Last night was great Will." Buffy smiled warmly. "Though I think with Nicole and I droning on about our hatred of life's cruel twists, you and Tara must have been really bored."</p>

		<p>"No, it was nice to see you venting and laughing." Willow smiled. "Nicole is really nice, Tara says she's a sweetie."</p>

		<p>"She seemed super nice." Buffy laughed as she remembered their walk home. "I can't believe Chris cheated on her. Any woman would be lucky to get Nicole as a girlfriend."</p>

		<p>"Oh she told you?" Willow felt a vague tension creep into her shoulders.</p>

		<p>"I sorta figured it out Will." Buffy raised an eyebrow. "It's no biggie though, having your heart broken is the same girl or boy."</p>

		<p>"Yep." The hacker grinned widely when she saw her best friend's sudden comfortableness. "Though now I feel out of the loop." Her face fell a little. "I was the stupid one who assumed that Chris was a boy."</p>

		<p>"Will, don't worry. It wasn't like Nicole had a billboard advertisement about it." Buffy laughed and shook her head at the hacker's forlorn face. "She doesn't hide things but she doesn't broadcast them either, like you and Tara, I admire that. Shows a real comfortableness with herself." Feeling like she'd said too much suddenly she picked up a small book on demonology in the middle of the table and absently flipped through it.</p>

		<p>"I had this silly notion that you had assumed Chris was a guy too and that if Nicole had hit on you…" Willow began reading again out of the book in front of her and made the comment without looking up. </p>

		<p>"Yeah?" Buffy's eyes shot up from the book suddenly. "Oh I get it." She felt a sharp pang of hurt and vague anger float up. "I'd end up acting all wiggy and stupid so that I made a complete ass of myself."</p>

		<p>"No." Willow's look shot up from the book. "I didn't mean that."</p>

		<p>"Look Will." The Slayer didn't know what was fuelling her on as her words hissed out across the table. "I know I acted like a complete ass when you told me about Tara. I know I've said stupid things, mostly when I've been trying hard to not say stupid things but could I get a bit of credit?" She closed the book and put it back in its place. "But Nicole just had her heart broken, I think I'm in control of enough compassion to gracefully decline if she had of hit on me."</p>

		<p>"Buffy, I didn't mean…" Willow stammered under the Slayer's words. She assumed a lot, she knew that now and all of her assumptions had hurt her friend deeply.</p>

		<p>"Whatever you meant Willow, the last thing in the world I would have done last night is hurt her. Try to give me a bit more credit Will." Buffy felt her voice soften as she registered the sad look on the hacker's face. "I'm going to go do my meditation before Giles' face stays in that furrow." She pointed to the watcher behind the counter.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, I will." Willow tiny voice received a nod before the Slayer headed for the back training room.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy didn't know what happened till the end of her pen stuck sharply into her cheek and roused her from her twice-weekly psychology nap. As always it was just in time to hear the professor stress the importance of following some guideline before he dismissed the class. </p>

		<p>"I think I missed something big." She looked to the long lines of chalk scrawled onto the board and felt a deep sinking in her stomach. The Professor's handwriting was a mystery to her at the best of times, but since it seems he had been in a hurry she was able to make out even less than usually. "Paper, APA standards, pre-approved topic…" She scribbled down what she could. "Worth thirty five percent of our final grade." The words made her blood run cold. </p>

		<p>"These may help with the decryption a bit." A voice accompanied the sudden appearance of three sheets of neatly written paper into the Slayer's view.</p>

		<p>"I know Willow didn't take this class, so my guess is benevolent guardian angel?" Buffy smiled as she turned to see the owner of the voice already recognizing it. </p>

		<p>"Nope." Nicole laughed as she stepped over the row of seating and slid into the chair next to Buffy. Her hair tied back into a loose ponytail and tucked under a navy Toronto Argonauts cap that matched the oversized jersey she was wearing over a simple pair of jeans. "Just someone who can't manage to find these seats as comfy as you apparently do."</p>

		<p>"Hey this one has a two inch square of padding left." The Slayer laughed. "It makes a world of difference."</p>

		<p>"I bet it does." The brunette laughed and shook her head. "I always sit at the back and those seats are extra worn and uncomfy."</p>

		<p>"I was just going to ask the ultra stupid 'are you in this class?' question." Buffy stuffed her clipboard into her bag. </p>

		<p>"I am but its so huge it's hard to keep track of anybody." Nicole smiled. "So shall we go photocopy these for you sleepyhead?" She stood up and shrugged into her knapsack.</p>

		<p>"You're a lifesaver." Buffy smiled back. </p>

		<p>"And since I'm assuming you didn't notice…" Nicole meandered her way through the thinning throng of exiting students. "We're allowed to work in pairs for the research and paper. You wouldn't be looking for a partner would you?" She asked the hopeful question.</p>

		<p>"Well if the outline for the paper took up three pages I think I'm in desperate need for a partner." Buffy followed her out. "The question is do you want to work with someone who can't stay awake for longer than sixty seconds once Dr. Reynold's starts talking?"</p>

		<p>"I'm sure you're brilliant." Nicole nodded that she did. "The photocopier in the business annex is always free if you don't mind a little bit of a walk."</p>

		<p>"I don't have class for an hour." Buffy let the brown hair girl lead them outside into the bright afternoon sun. </p>

		<p>"Are there any other notes you're missing?" Nicole raised a sly eyebrow as they walked. "I don't have mine with me but I could photocopy them for next class if you were desperately in need of any."</p>

		<p>"Will you run or just laugh at me when I say I need all but the first one?" Buffy bit her lip feeling horrible for having to admit this. She'd tried to stick by her guns and not take any more psychology classes but when her careful timetable scheduling had fallen apart and she'd been left with a giant gapping whole that needed to be filled the psych class had been the perfect fit. That her nights were busy Slaying was something as always that would easily explain her lack of educational attention but was also something she couldn't use to her advantage.</p>

		<p>"Let's just say you owe me lunch." Nicole smiled and shook her head with a laugh.</p>

		<p>"Now that I can manage." Buffy laughed with her as they walked.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy rapped the short rhythm on the door and leaned against the wall as she waited for an answer. </p>

		<p>"I'm almost ready." Willow flung the door open with one sneaker on and the other in her hand. </p>

		<p>"No rush Will, the evil creatures of the night will wait five minutes I'm sure." Buffy smiled brightly at her.</p>

		<p>"Are you sure you want me to come with you?" Willow bent down to tie her other shoe. </p>

		<p>"Of course I do." Buffy stepped into the doorway. "I'm sorry I yelled at you at the magic shop. I just…"</p>

		<p>"No Buffy, I'm the one who's sorry." Willow shook her head and stood up. </p>

		<p>"How about we just chalk it up experience and not worry about it anymore?" The Slayer picked the hacker's jacket off the floor for her. </p>

		<p>"Sounds great." Willow nodded happily as she followed her best friend out.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy didn't breath as the dusty remains of the vampire billowed in a cloud around her before settling down.</p>

		<p>"Well I have to say he was easy." The Slayer spun her stake and replaced it into her jacket.</p>

		<p>"With your new training schedule the vamps don't have a chance." Willow looked on trying to calm her heart down. Though she knew the young man was a newly emerged fledgling and from the first moment Buffy had everything in control she still couldn't keep herself from reacting in the same familiar scared way. </p>

		<p>"I'm sure they'll catch up soon." The Slayer cocked her head to one side only to see a cat scurry its way out of the bushes nearby. "So how did your utopian society presentation go?" She caught up to the hacker's place and the two began walking again.</p>

		<p>"Well except for my getting tongue tied in front of audiences thing it went fine." Willow rolled her eyes. "How about you? How's psych going?"</p>

		<p>"Well I'm still using it to catch up on my beauty rest." She laughed knowing the hacker would know what she was talking about. "But I have a new guardian angel of notes in the class since horrible you didn't take that course." She playfully swatted the hacker with the end of her scarf.</p>

		<p>"Who?" Willow turned excitedly. "Some big hunky new man, ready to sweep you off your feet into romantic bliss?"</p>

		<p>"Well not quite." Buffy's face fell as her friend's explanation went on. "Nicole."</p>

		<p>"Oh Nicole." Willow immediately turned her mind away from all the things she'd been thinking. "I forgot she was a psych major."</p>

		<p>"She is." Buffy nodded. "We have this big research paper to do, so her and I are going to work together in the hopes of making it easier."</p>

		<p>"And so that you can steal her class notes?" Willow laughed lightly knowing full well the Slayer's horrible record for notes.</p>

		<p>"Not stealing, I owe her lunch for them." The Slayer grinned. </p>

		<p>"Well at least she's got enough sense to demand repayment." The hacker knew all too well how a Slayer's notebook needed to be supplemented. "Though hold on!" She stopped walking and folding her arms to give Buffy an angry scowl.</p>

		<p>"Hold on what?" The Slayer did a three sixty expecting trouble but finding none.</p>

		<p>"If the deal is notes for lunch, are you at all aware Miss. Summers' how many lunches you owe me by now?" Willow wagged a finger at her.</p>

		<p>"Too many for you too eat waif girl." Buffy laughed at the hacker's mock show.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Willow trotted up the last of the stairs towards her girlfriend's place. It had been easier for Buffy to drop her off here when they'd finished the somewhat uneventful evening patrol. She was about to knock on the door when she remember the stern look and long conversation about how Tara wanted her to feel at home so she checked the unlocked doorknob and just walked in.</p>

		<p>"Hey." Tara turned from the book she was reading and waved a sweater-clad hand at her lover. "Everything okay on patrol?"</p>

		<p>"Still nothing apocalyptic or earth shattering." Willow dropped her coat over a chair and moved across the room. "Missed you." She bent down and enjoyed a long kiss with the blonde.</p>

		<p>"Apparently you did." Tara took a deep breath at the end and smiled. "How's Buffy doing?" </p>

		<p>"Well Riley took up part of the conversation but not much all things considered." Willow walked back over and flopped down onto the bed. "Being generous only about 20% of the total conversation. The winner was how infuriating her sister is and how helpless she feels about her mom." She reached down and pulled off her socks tossing them into the laundry basket in the corner of the room. Absently she stroked Miss. Kitty's back, much to the annoyance of the sleeping kitten before she rolled over to have her tummy rubbed. </p>

		<p>"She deserves much better than Riley." Tara placed a worn leather bookmark at the page she was on before moving over and dropping to sit at the redhead's feet. </p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, on a great Buffy is making new friends note." Willow sat up to face the blonde. "Her and Nicole are working on a psych project together."</p>

		<p>"They are?" Tara's face lit up. "That's great."</p>

		<p>"That's what I thought." Willow patted the kitten's stomach before pushing up on her elbows. "It's been hard at times for Buffy to connect with people who aren't in on the whole living in a Hellmouth, she's the Chosen One thing but maybe this project with Nicole will give her that."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, Nicole is as normal as they come." Tara smiled. "Well other than being from Canada and having that strange obsession with watching football."</p>

		<p>"A little butchy is she." Willow raised an eyebrow laughing.</p>

		<p>"That's the weird thing, she's not at all." Tara laughed with her. "Apparently her step dad watches it all the time and she just picked up a love for it."</p>

		<p>"Fair enough." Willow laughed before falling back down on the bed. </p>

		<p>"Willow, have you ever thought that m-maybe…" Tara's voice trailed off as she pulled herself further up the bed to lie down next to her lover.</p>

		<p>"Maybe what?" Willow turned her head to face the blonde, reaching out to play with the hem of her shirt.</p>

		<p>"Well, we've both agreed Riley wasn't right for Buffy." Tara's voice went very soft as she leaned into Willow's body and snuggled in to the hacker's neck.</p>

		<p>"Yes." Willow closed her eyes as Tara's breath activated little shivers within her.</p>

		<p>"And you've told me a thousand times how horrible Angel was for her." Tara kept going and busied her lips with kissing Willow's neck when her words stopped.</p>

		<p>"Well the whole vampire with a cursed soul thing was a bit of a crux." She moved her head a little to the side partly hoping Tara would ignore the conversation and keep up her current activity.</p>

		<p>"W-What if that's because Buffy isn't meant to find happiness with anyone of the male species." Tara moved one arm over her lover as she came up and held her face over the redhead's. She lowered her lips over Willow's before the hacker could answer.</p>

		<p>"With that evidence I'm starting to be swayed." Willow moved back out of the kiss momentarily as she pulled the blonde down closer to her. </p>

		<p>"Let's just see if we can completely convince you." Tara gave her a wicked smirk before moving in for another searing kiss. </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy rounded the dark corner of the library catacombs trying to retrace her way to the table she knew was around her somewhere. Take quick glances around the high stack of books she carried she did her best to keep an eye on where she was going. </p>

		<p>"Whoa." Nicole spotted the Slayer emerging from between two of the rows and jumped up to help. "Let me take a few of those." She pulled a few of the books off the top to give Buffy a clearer view.</p>

		<p>"Thanks." Buffy smiled and easily made the rest of the way to their table. With a loud thump she dropped them onto the old worn wood. "I have to say the ambience down here is amazing." She turned to the brunette after glancing around again. The aged and tattering posters that lined the painted cement walls were hardly readable. That this entire bottom basement held about a dozen large tables was anyone's guess when you first came off the elevator, but in amongst the large looming stacks were alcoves hidden away from everyone until you were right on them.</p>

		<p>"Very conductive to the 'do lots of work in a short time and get the hell out of the library' attitude." Nicole laughed as she sat down in a creaky chair. "So do you think we'll find anything useful in these?" She looked at the three large stacks of bound journals and various books.</p>

		<p>"Well hopefully we'll get some leads from the references sections at least." Buffy sat down as well, hoping that Nicole had noticed her direct reference to Dr. Reynold's prescribed technique. She might not have been awake the first time but she'd definitely taken the time to thoroughly read the brunette's accurate notes. </p>

		<p>"Very impressive Miss. Summers." Nicole laughed as she pulled open the first dusty book. "And on that note I was thinking. How about we just mark all the ones we think are relevant and then photocopy them so we can do an in depth information pull later?"</p>

		<p>"Sounds perfect." Buffy nodded as she too pulled open a volume. "Especially since I'm afraid if we spent too long down here we might never find our way out again."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tara shifted her hip bag around her body a little as she leaned against the wall outside of the large double doors. A glance at her watch told her that Willow's class should be finished at any moment and she hoped the hacker wouldn't have made any other plans yet. As her mind drifted she didn't even notice the doors open up and students beginning to stream there way out.</p>

		<p>"And what's a beautiful girl like you doing looking so deep in thought?" Willow leaned against the wall next to her girlfriend and whispered the greeting to her.</p>

		<p>"Oh Willow!" Tara jumped and stood up, laughing lightly when she saw it was just the hacker. </p>

		<p>"Buffy and I have been working on my stealth approach." Willow grinned. </p>

		<p>"No more practicing on me." Tara grinned back. "I wanted to know if you had time for a coffee. I have news." She rubbed her finger down over her nose, the code they'd decided to put on their new secret quest. </p>

		<p>"Definitely have time then." Willow laughed as she repeated the move and they headed off to the coffee shop.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Willow double-checked the occupants of the shop to make sure no one was there who could possibly overhear their conversation and have any interest in it.</p>

		<p>"So tell me again why we're doing this?" Willow cupped her coffee in both hands as she looked at her lover.</p>

		<p>"We're not really doing anything." Tara gave her a sweet smile, not entirely sure why she had her heart so set on this. "We're just giving things a little outside stir to see if any spells develop."</p>

		<p>"Okay, okay." Willow conceded knowing her lover was right. Their long conversation in bed after a slight detour on the subject had filled her with a certain enthusiasm. "As long as we totally agree on the rules."</p>

		<p>"We have very clear rules." Tara nodded and reached out to pat her hand. "No direct intervention either in comment or deed. No major interference in any sense and if Buffy ever even hints she's upset about it then we stop right away."</p>

		<p>"Yep thems the rules." The hacker nodded enthusiastically. "Cause even if Buffy's had bad luck with men it doesn't mean she has a true appreciation for…" She winked at her lover and blushed deeply.</p>

		<p>"I know, but you said it yourself without a little bit of gentle prodding she's not likely to ever give herself a chance to appreciate." Tara took a sip of her milkshake.</p>

		<p>"Okay, so what's the new info?" Willow laughed again as she ran a finger down her nose.</p>

		<p>"Guess which two people are currently holed up the basement of the library doing research?" Tara raised an eyebrow.</p>

		<p>"They're doing a project together." The redhead stated the obvious. "They have to be at the library together."</p>

		<p>"Yes, I know but…" Tara tapped the fingers on the table. "If you and I were to run into a certain Slayer and psych major, say…" She kept tapping faster as she thought. "And suggested a little dinner, finishing in time of course for Buffy to go on patrol…" She stopped her tapping. "It would keep them together for a few more hours and give chemistry a time to kick in."</p>

		<p>"Wouldn't that count as direct intervention?" Willow leaned across the table a little as she played with her spoon. </p>

		<p>"Well no." Tara's face took on an innocent look as she shook her head. "Not with the logic that we all have to eat, whether we eat together or not, so why not all eat together?" </p>

		<p>"Oh so direct intervention would be like…" The redhead thought for a moment. "Like getting the two of them out to dinner and then making up some emergency so we could leave."</p>

		<p>"That would be against the rules." Tara nodded enthusiastically.</p>

		<p>"Okay, lets finish these and run by the library." Willow smiled at her girlfriend.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy didn't know what was going on until she felt a light hand on her shoulder and a gentle voice calling a name. As she registered the owner of both was Nicole and that under her cheek was the cold dusty page of a book she almost wanted to pretend that she'd dropped into a coma.</p>

		<p>"Please pay no attention to the comatose girl." Buffy imitated a computerized voice as she squeezed her eyes touched. "She has already died of embarrassment, though if you leave a message after the beep we'll be sure to forward it to her in 'I can't believe I fell asleep' land."</p>

		<p>"Don't be so silly." Nicole pulled back and sat down in the chair beside the Slayer. "Besides you look so cute drooling all over." She laughed as the blonde finally opened an eye. "I finished all the photocopying so you and I are free." </p>

		<p>"I'm so sorry." Buffy sat up and tried to wipe the previously mentioned drool from her cheek. "I've been putting in extra hard training hours because of the lull…" Her eyes went wide as she realized what she'd been about to say.</p>

		<p>"What are you in training for?" Nicole asked without missing a beat as the Slayer's words fell away.</p>

		<p>"Martial arts." Buffy decided sticking as close to the truth might help her in the long run. "Can't be too careful walking around campus at night." She flipped through the pile of papers Nicole had returned with. </p>

		<p>"I wasn't aware I had protection walking with me the other night." Nicole laughed as she reached into her purse. "I wouldn't have bothered keeping one hand on my mace." </p>

		<p>"That stuff will only work on certain people." Buffy felt a very cold slice inside at the idea of Nicole having to face anything, living or dead that would precipitate her fighting for survival. But she above anyone knew it was an everyday occurrence. Though the brunette was slightly taller than the Slayer, Buffy doubted that even with her well-toned figure she'd be much match for many of the creatures she met on a nightly basis. "Anyway, I could have dealt with anything that came our way." She looked down and cursed herself for sounding like she was bragging.</p>

		<p>"I'm sure you pack a punch that no one expects." Nicole smiled and began cleaning up. "When do you want to get together to wade through all of this?" </p>

		<p>"Evenings are bad for me." Buffy said honestly. "But name a time before dusk and I'm there."</p>

		<p>"How about Saturday? We can hole up at my place with some pizza and read till we're dizzy." She flipped the latch closed on her knapsack.</p>

		<p>"Sounds great." Buffy nodded as she packed up her stuff as well. </p>

		<p>"Hey you two." Willow led Tara through the complicated labyrinth of shelves and emerged in the alcove. </p>

		<p>"Hey Will." Buffy snapped to attention when she saw the slightly apprehensive look on her friend's face. "Everything okay?"</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah." The hacker nodded. "Tara and I were just going for some dinner at that new mexican place and were wondering if you wanted to join us."</p>

		<p>"Hummm mexican?" Buffy licked at her lips. "I'm in." </p>

		<p>"Great." Willow nodded holding her breath as they waited. She turned to see the look of apprehension on her girlfriend's face as well. They'd agreed to wait for a few moments to see if Buffy asked Nicole herself before Tara jumped in.</p>

		<p>"I had their takeaway the other night, it's superb." Nicole added the appraisal absently as she slung her bag onto her shoulder. </p>

		<p>"You should come with us, after all I owe you for all that photocopying." Buffy made the invitation as she looped the strap of her bag over her head. </p>

		<p>"You sure?" The brunette looked between the three of them. "I don't want to barge in." </p>

		<p>"N-No, you could never barge in." Tara felt the words tumble out before she could stop herself.</p>

		<p>"No barging, I just invited you." Buffy smiled at Tara and let the happy expression stay as she turned to Nicole. "But one rule…" She pushed her chair in. "No school talk."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy held on tightly to her sides as she laughed. She could hardly remember what had started this string of ridiculous jokes but as they kept going she could barely control herself enough to breath.</p>

		<p>"Enough, enough." Nicole begged for everyone to stop as she too struggled to get breath.</p>

		<p>"I think maybe we better pay up cause we're getting some very nasty looks from the waitress." Tara turned away from the older woman's glare. </p>

		<p>"How much?" Nicole reached for the bill but the Slayer snatched it out of her grasp in a flash.</p>

		<p>"Hey I said my treat." Buffy gave her a serious look as she folded the bill and stood up. </p>

		<p>"And since a certain girl owes me for many, many notes." Willow raised a mischievous eyebrow at the Slayer.</p>

		<p>"Yes Will." Buffy laughed. "You and Tara are covered." </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"You know if you two have something else to do?" Buffy turned as they walked and spoke to the Wiccans that followed her. </p>

		<p>"Us? More important than keeping you company?" Willow looked at Tara who adamantly shook her head. "Nope."</p>

		<p>"Okay, but this better not just be pity for this seemingly unemployed Slayer." Buffy smiled at them, secretly very happy for their company.</p>

		<p>"No pity." Tara shook her head. "It's been such a great dinner and why should the party stop just because you have to patrol."</p>

		<p>"No reason." Buffy agreed and turned her attention partially back to her task.</p>

		<p>"It's too bad we had to drop Nicole off." Willow added slyly, trying to play innocent under the look Tara shot her. </p>

		<p>"Yeah, well you know how it is Will." Buffy sighed heavily. "I just hope she bought that story about us working at the magic shop every evening."</p>

		<p>"Well it's sorta true." Tara tried to be supportive. "Maybe you should bring her by it one day, just to solidify the cover story." It was the blonde's turn to play innocent under Willow's eyes.</p>

		<p>"I don't want to stir up trouble." Buffy turned around briefly to shake her head. "So far Nicole thinks I'm your average run of the mill college student and there's no reason for her to think otherwise."</p>

		<p>The other girls exchanged a sad look briefly as they kept walking. </p>

		<p>'This might be an impossible task even if Buffy does like her.' Willow thought to herself as she watched the Slayer bury her hands in her pockets as she walked.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tara pulled at her skirt as she crossed and re-crossed her legs. She didn't know why she'd agreed to do this. Yes, she was Nicole's friend. Yes, she and Nicole often met for coffee and such but this time it felt so underhanded. That she was primed with a number of suggestive comments and questions made her nervous and she hoped her stuttering wouldn't get out of hand.</p>

		<p>'And you're doing this because Willow can be very convincing.' She thought and laughed to herself. </p>

		<p>"You know laughing to yourself is actually a sign of sanity rather than insanity." Nicole grinned as she dropped down onto the well-worn coffee shop sofa beside the blonde.</p>

		<p>"I was just thinking of something Willow did." Tara smiled shyly. </p>

		<p>"You are so lucky Tara." Nicole smiled back at her. "Willow's a great girl. I only hope I find someone half as special as her."</p>

		<p>"She's magic." The blonde nodded. </p>

		<p>"So let me get this whine out of the way first." Nicole reached forward and cupped the latte Tara had already ordered for her. "Chris called and you won't believe the one and only thing she had to say to me?"</p>

		<p>"What?" Tara felt her heart rise in her throat. If Chris came back into Nicole's life now the entire plan was lost. </p>

		<p>"That she wanted the sketches I did of her for my art class back." Nicole gripped the cup tightly as she tried not to let her anger get the better of her. "I have to hand my portfolio in on Monday and all of my charcoal section is her."</p>

		<p>"Are you going to give them back?" Tara tried not to breath a sigh of relief as she knew what a blow this was to her friend. Though she was at the top of her psychology classes, Nicole's true gift and passion was in her drawings and her minor in fine arts filled her muse just enough without interfering in her major.</p>

		<p>"I already have, I dropped them off on the way." Nicole put the cup back down and shook her head. "She had some crazy idea that because she's semi-nude in some of them I was going to flash them around town to embarrass her. She was my human body subject, its not like we took pictures in bed or something."</p>

		<p>"You're too nice Nicole." Tara patted her arm sympathetically. "What are you going to do?"</p>

		<p>"I have to find a new subject this weekend and manage to pull some brilliant sketches out of the air. I've been working on the ones of Chris for two months." Nicole sadly leaned her head into her hands. "I just don't know anyone who I can ask to pose." </p>

		<p>"W-What about B-Buffy?" Tara didn't know where the question came from but it blurted out of her none the less.</p>

		<p>"Do you think she'd do it?" Nicole's eyes lit up and then shadowed. "Wait, I could never ask her that. She'd think I was hitting on her."</p>

		<p>"No, no." Tara jumped in again. "She's smart enough to realize how much trouble you're in when you explain it to her and I know you Nicole…" She patted her friend's arm again. "You'd never do anything like that even if you did like her."</p>

		<p>"I'm not that slick for one." The brunette laughed lightly at herself. "And I'd never risk upsetting Buffy either. Our projects going great and she's nice to hang around."</p>

		<p>"See, there's no reason why you shouldn't at least ask her." She pushed lightly. "The worst she can say is no."</p>

		<p>"Do you know where I can find her?" Nicole asked setting her mind to the task. "She's supposed to be coming over tomorrow to work on our project anyway, maybe she can come over earlier and I can sketch while she's reading even." </p>

		<p>"She'll be at the Magic Box." Tara gave the simple answer as she put down her cup. As she realized what she'd said she almost tipped it over. </p>

		<p>"Do you think her boss will mind if I just pop in to ask?" Nicole shifted to sit on the edge of the sofa as she went to stand up. </p>

		<p>"I better go with you." Tara didn't know any normal way to discourage her from going. "I help with the inventory sometimes so Mr. Giles won't get upset if I come in with you too."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tara felt herself growing edgier and edgier as they reached main street and then were at the door to the magic shop. Trying to be as normal as possible she lead Nicole in and headed straight to the counter. </p>

		<p>"Hello Mr. Giles." She put her hand on the counter to draw the Watcher out of the book he was reading. "We were wondering if Buffy was at work today?" She stared at him hard as she said the words.</p>

		<p>"She's in the back." Giles looked from the blonde wiccan to the newcomer with her.</p>

		<p>"Sorry to interrupt her while she's working, but if I could just speak to her for a minute or two you'd be saving my life." Nicole walked closer to the counter a little distracted by the strange contents of the store. </p>

		<p>"I'm sure I can spare her for a moment." Giles gave a strained smile. "Tara why don't you go back and ask her to stop her…" He stammered for a moment. "Her work."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, I'll get her." Tara shot the older man a smile and hurried into the back room.</p>

		<p>"Thanks." Nicole stood awkwardly as the man nodded and returned to his book.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tara knew that the Slayer was too engrossed in her workout to react to her entrance just yet. She waited until the blonde had landed after a complicated series of flips before she spoke.</p>

		<p>"B-Buffy?" Tara tried to find volume for her voice. </p>

		<p>"You look like you saw a ghost, what's wrong?" Buffy wiped an arm across her sweaty forehead. </p>

		<p>"Nicole." The blonde said the one name and then realized it told the Slayer nothing.</p>

		<p>"What's wrong?" Buffy felt her heart sail up into her throat. </p>

		<p>"She's outside, in the shop." Tara pointed out the door. "I couldn't stop her from coming, she needs to talk to you. She thinks you're working today."</p>

		<p>"Oh well that's a good cover." Buffy looked down at the soaked sweats she was wearing. There was no time to change so she might as well face this now.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p> "Buffy and I are doing a project for a psychology class we have together." The brunette smiled at the Slayer's younger sister who had appeared out from behind one of the bookshelves and hopped up to sit on the counter.</p>

		<p>"You do all that freaky stuff about people's minds and stuff right, cool." Dawn chewed her gum, as she looked the newcomer up and down. "Where did you get your skirt? I love it." She smiled at the long denim item, embroidered with various dragon designs. Leave it to Tara to introduce her sister to someone so cool.</p>

		<p>"Downtown Toronto." Nicole answered with a laugh. "I don't think you'd have much luck around here."</p>

		<p>"That would explain why she talks funny." Anya added as she looked over at Giles who motioned for her to keep going with what she was doing.</p>

		<p>"It would." Nicole nodded. </p>

		<p>"Where's Toronto?" Dawn turned and asked Giles.</p>

		<p>Ringing her hands Buffy emerged from the back room with Tara in tow. A quick scan led her to see the worst-case scenario possible. </p>

		<p>"It's a city in Canada." Buffy answered the question as she moved over to the counter. "Have you been skipping Geography again?" </p>

		<p>"No!" Dawn rolled her eyes and hopped off the counter. "It was just a question."</p>

		<p>"No worries." Nicole laughed lightly. "I get it a lot."</p>

		<p>"You needed to talk to me?" Buffy smiled at Nicole as she waved behind her for the rest of the gang to go find something to do.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry for bugging you at work." The brunette gave her a sweet 'please forgive me smile'. "But I'm in a real quandary and I was wondering if you'd do me the biggest favour in the world."</p>

		<p>"I can try." Buffy turned and shot a look at Tara who was busy trying to keep Dawn occupied. The blonde's face gave her no indication what was going on.</p>

		<p>"Well I had an phone call from Chris." Nicole rolled her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Are you all right?" Buffy reached out a hand without thinking as she brushed the other woman's arm. She'd been lucky enough not to have been forced into any contact with Riley so far, which was a good thing. </p>

		<p>"Shaken, but more mad than anything." Nicole tried to hide a bit of what she was feeling. It was completely unfair to put all of this on her new friend while she was trying to work. "See I have to hand my art portfolio in on Monday and part of what I have to have done is a charcoal drawing section on the human form." Buffy kept quite as she waited for more information. "I had finished it all, but Chris had been my subject." Her voice dropped lower as she stepped back a bit further so that no one would be able to hear. "She demanded I give them back cause she got the idea in her head I was going to use them to embarrass her. So I've got a huge hole in my portfolio and only two days to fill it."</p>

		<p>"What are you asking here Nicole?" Buffy felt herself getting more and more nervous.</p>

		<p>"Could you come over a bit earlier on Saturday and…" The brunette took a deep breath. "Can I draw you while your reading some of the journals?"</p>

		<p>"I have one question." The Slayer took the other girl gently by the elbow and led her over to the front of the store out of everyone's sight behind one of the bookshelves. "Exactly why did Chris think the ones of her were embarrassing?"</p>

		<p>"Well…" Nicole bit her lip as she tried to find the best way of saying this without sending the blonde in front of her running. "Because she's topless in some of them and just in a sheet in others." Before Buffy could say anything she kept going. "I wouldn't expect that of you though. If you could just wear something like you've got on now it would be perfect." She looked down at the small tank top and shorts the Slayer wore, suddenly trying to figure out just what work the blonde had been doing in the back room. "It's just that the Professor won't mark any of my other sections unless I have a charcoal one. Even if he gives it a bad mark, the others might still keep my grade in a salvageable place."</p>

		<p>"You are absolutely desperate aren't you?" Buffy knew that despite her own internal objections she was already willing to help her new friend. After all how bad could letting Nicole draw her while she read be?</p>

		<p>"I am. I have no one else to ask." Nicole put on her best pleading look. "I'll owe you forever."</p>

		<p>"You don't owe me." Buffy shook her head and smiled. "But only on one condition."</p>

		<p>"Anything." Nicole breathed a sigh of relief as she realized Buffy was agreeing.</p>

		<p>"No one else knows about this." Buffy's voice had an edge of firmness in it. </p>

		<p>"Tara sorta already knows." Nicole bit her lip again worried she'd already be sunk.</p>

		<p>"We'll swear Tara to secrecy." Buffy patted the brunette's arm again to calm her down. "I just don't want anyone that I work with knowing." She tried to make her words come fluidly. "Or my sister."</p>

		<p>"Deal." Nicole grinned and impulsively hugged the Slayer. "Thanks." </p>

		<p>"You're welcome." Buffy tried to find some volume for her voice as her arms closed around Nicole's slim figure. Something about the movement, the decision of where to put her hands suddenly struck her as being so awkward though for the life of her she couldn't figure out why. As Nicole pulled away from her she worried her inner turmoil had been obvious.</p>

		<p>"So what time can I expect you Saturday?" Nicole asked quickly, not wanting to push her luck with Buffy's boss and keep the girl from her work any longer.</p>

		<p>"Before lunch, say elevenish?" Buffy hoped it wouldn't have to be too early, so that way she could get a few extra hours of sleep in. </p>

		<p>"Perfect." Nicole beamed. "I'll slip out so I don't irritate your boss." She began to move towards the door. "Thanks again Buffy."</p>

		<p>Buffy waved mutely as Nicole hustled out of the shop and the door chimed behind her. Closing her eyes she leaned back against the bookcase for a moment trying to think. </p>

		<p>'What exactly did you just get suckered into Summers?' She questioned herself as she tried to still her mind. </p>

		<p>"So?" Tara quietly stuck her head around the side of the bookcase.</p>

		<p>"You and me in the back now." Buffy snapped her eyes open as a moment of panic overtook her and she stalked off towards the training room. </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Tara sheepishly followed the Slayer through the magic shop and closed the door behind them. </p>

		<p>"I-I-I'm so sorry Buffy. She got it in her head to come here and I had no idea how to talk her out of it without it s-s-seeming odd." She tried to explain in a hope of quelling the Slayer's annoyance.</p>

		<p>"Tara, I'm not mad at you." Buffy shook her head as she sat down on one of the benches and motioned for the Wiccan to join her. "Just how exactly did my name and modelling get brought up together?"</p>

		<p>"Well when she told me her problem." Tara sat down as she was instructed keeping her hands on her knees. "We went through all the people she could ask and you came up as the person most likely to be nice enough to do it."</p>

		<p>"I can't believe Chris made her give the sketches back." Buffy cupped her hand around the wood of the bench until her knuckles went white. "Nicole is the last person on earth that would use a picture like that to embarrass someone." She vented the anger in her mind somewhat forgetting that Tara was even there. "I mean I know I haven't known her that long, but I know people and I especially know bad people. It wouldn't even come in her mind to do that. Don't you think?" She suddenly turned the question on the other blonde.</p>

		<p>"N-N-Never." Tara shook her head instantly.</p>

		<p>"I just want to keep this between the three of us okay?" Buffy pulled one leg up under her as she turned to the blonde. "You can tell Will, I mean you don't have to keep a secret from her or anything but I just don't want the whole Scooby gang knowing."</p>

		<p>"I can understand that." Tara smiled slightly as she agreed.</p>

		<p>"Dawn will just go on and on about it and Xander would probably make some stupid comments which would result in either Anya or myself hitting him. It'll just be better if we keep this quiet." Buffy didn't know why she felt such urgency in making Tara see what she meant.</p>

		<p>"Buffy, don't worry." Tara reached out and patted the Slayer's hand. "Just between us." </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"She made you swear you wouldn't tell anyone?" Willow almost let the book in her hand drop but caught it in time. All Tara could do was nod. "This says lots." She rose up off the chair and paced over to the bed where her lover was sitting.</p>

		<p>"Does it?" Tara looked at the redhead not so convinced. "She just doesn't want everyone teasing her about posing. Even though she's going to wear clothing, you know the first thing Xander will do is tease her about 'spells'."
		</p>

		<p>"That's the biggest point though." Willow dropped onto the bed. "Buffy never cares that much about being teased. Well except for anyone bringing up the married to Spike thing, but that was my fault. I should make her some more cookies to say I'm sorry for that."</p>

		<p>"Willow." Tara tried to call her girlfriend back to the conversation. "I think she was just flustered because I brought Nicole to the Magic Box. You know how she wants to keep the Slayer stuff secret from her."</p>

		<p>"I have to talk to her." Willow stood up again suddenly and went to the chair to grab her coat.</p>

		<p>"Do you really think that's a good idea?" Tara leaned back against the high-stacked pillows and shook her head.</p>

		<p>"No direct interference, I promise." The redhead grinned as she raced out the door. </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy had just eased herself out of a steaming post-patrol bath when the doorbell rang downstairs. She was happy now that her sister was still up and was able to get the door. As Willow's voice floated up the stairs she was filled with a sudden edgy concern that something was wrong. After all things had been quiet around Sunnydale and having too much down time always put her on edge. </p>

		<p>"Will, what's wrong?" She appeared at the top of the stairs in a fluffy robe with her hair wrapped up in a towel.</p>

		<p>"Nothing, I just wanted to talk to you." Willow kicked herself as she realized she had not even thought of a cover as to why she was barging into the Summer's home at eleven o'clock at night.</p>

		<p>"Really." Buffy raised an eyebrow at her knowing something must be going on. "Why don't we go get something to drink and Dawn I think you should be in bed by now."</p>

		<p>"You are such a pain and you are not the boss of me." Dawn stuck her tongue out at her sister as she trudged her way noisily up the stairs.</p>

		<p>"So full spillage Will." Buffy followed the hacker into the kitchen. "What's up?"</p>

		<p>"I talked to Tara." Willow figured she might as well start off with the conversation as close to where she wanted it to be just to see where it got her. </p>

		<p>"I guess she told you about my little leap into art." Buffy gave the redhead a quick smile as she went to the fridge and pulled out two bottles of flavoured water.</p>

		<p>"You are so brave." Willow smiled as she took the water. </p>

		<p>"I'm going to have clothes on, that is already an established point." Buffy rolled her eyes and sat down at the island. "Tara must have told you that part?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but I just wanted more than anything to say how proud I am of you." Willow's voice was soft and honest.</p>

		<p>"Proud of me for putting on a tank top and letting Nicole sketch me?" Buffy gave her a confused look.</p>

		<p>"No, for being so cool about this." Willow grinned at her briefly. "I mean I know you always feel so bad about how you were when I first told you about Tara."</p>

		<p>"I was an ass Will." Buffy grinned back briefly.</p>

		<p>"No, you were a bit shocked that's all." The hacker took a sip of her drink. "But now look at you. I'm so proud of you for agreeing to do this for Nicole without thinking… well you know what anyone could think."</p>

		<p>"What could anyone think?" Buffy began peeling the label off her bottle as she questioned the hacker.</p>

		<p>"I just think I'm lucky to have a best friend whose so open minded." Willow stepped away from the direct question waiting to see if the Slayer would fill it in herself.</p>

		<p>"Will, I am not stupid enough to think that Nicole would fabricate all this in order to get me in a tank top and hit on me." Buffy laughed and shook her head. "We're friends, she needed my help. That's that, the only reason I didn't want the rest of the gang to know was that would be the exact first thought Xander would come up with and I think Nicole deserves more credit than that."</p>

		<p>"You two are becoming pretty good friends." Willow began to pull the label off her bottle as well. "Have you given anymore thought to telling her about the whole slayer thing?"</p>

		<p>"She doesn't need to know, so no, I haven't thought about it." Buffy shook her head. "Willow, why all this sudden query about Nicole?" She fixed the redhead under an unwavering eye. Something was going on and she was pretty sure she wasn't going to like it.</p>

		<p>"Sudden query about Nicole?" Willow sat straight up. "I didn't realize I had done any sudden query." </p>

		<p>"Come on, I know you." Buffy kept looking at her friend. "Something's up."</p>

		<p>"I just want you to be happy Buffy. After all the trouble last year, and then Riley." Willow gave her a sad look. "I worry about you."</p>

		<p>"Willow, I'm fine. Getting more and more over Riley everyday." The Slayer gave a tight smile. "And yes to be honest Nicole has helped a lot with that. I think I've helped her get over Chris, since we both had a mutual vent."</p>

		<p>"It's so strange sometimes how people come into our lives just when we needed them most but weren't really looking for them." Willow smiled brightly. </p>

		<p>"Yeah it is." Buffy turned and looked out the window suddenly not able to meet her best friends eyes. "Willow…" She didn't look back as she voiced her question in a quite tone. "When you realized you liked Tara, how did that make you feel?"</p>

		<p>"I was petrified." Willow took a deep breath before she answered the question she couldn't believe the Slayer had asked. She tried not to read too much into it, after all it could just be an innocent question. "All I could think of was how shocked everyone was going to be. I mean I'd just broken up with Oz and there was that horrible my will be done spell. But I couldn't deny what I felt for her, I couldn't ignore it. She made me happy."</p>

		<p>"You're the brave one Willow." Buffy turned back slowly and smiled at her friend. "You listened to your heart even thought you were scared."</p>

		<p>"It's easier than you think." The redhead smiled back softly. "Only takes a little leap."</p>

		<p>"It's a huge one Will." Buffy turned back towards the window.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Willow tried to be as quiet as possible as she pulled on an oversized t-shirt and then slipped into bed beside her sleeping girlfriend.</p>

		<p>"How was Buffy's?" Tara rolled over sleepily and snuggled into the redhead's body the moment she rested on the mattress.</p>

		<p>"It was interesting." Willow kissed her forehead lightly as she wrapped her arms around the blonde. "I think the Slayer is struggling to figure out just what she wants."</p>

		<p>"I'm sure her best friend made her feel better." Tara opened her sleepy eyes and looked up. </p>

		<p>"I tried, but she really just talked around things. I could be wrong though." Willow yawned.</p>

		<p>"Only time will tell." Tara closed her eyes again.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy made herself comfortable on the well worn couch in Nicole's living room as the brunette ran off to make them some lemonade. She looked around the small apartment, having to give her friend credit for the way the seeming mishmash of colours and decorations had been pulled together into something gorgeous.</p>

		<p>"I love the painting of the snow scene." Buffy called loudly as she stood up and crossed the room to take a better look at the large piece. Looking down in the corner a simple scripted N and V made her realize just who had painted it.</p>

		<p>"That was my acceptance piece for the college." Nicole emerged with two icy glasses of lemonade. "It's a park near my mom's house."</p>

		<p>"Wow." Buffy studied the intricate nature of the snowdrifts, swearing to herself that they were moving as she watched them. "I mean really wow." She turned and accepted the glass.</p>

		<p>"I dabble." Nicole smiled and moved over to the couch. "I can drag out my portfolio if you want to decide if you're still up to being a subject."</p>

		<p>"I said I'd do it and a S…" Buffy realized she was about to put her foot in her mouth but quickly changed her words. "Summers' never backs out."</p>

		<p>"I'm glad. Though I was wondering one thing?" Nicole put her glass down on the table hoping that Buffy wouldn't be too adverse to her new idea.</p>

		<p>"Hoping what?" The Slayer raised an eyebrow as she sat down on the end of the couch.</p>

		<p>"Remember how you told me you did a lot of training, for your martial arts?" Nicole turned and picked up one of the throw pillows to play with its fringe as the blonde nodded at her. "I was wondering if you'd do a few of the positions for me to draw."</p>

		<p>"Well I could do some of both the fighting positions and the meditation positions for you if you wanted." Buffy agreed easily. She'd been up all night worrying just what it was going to be like having to concentrate on reading while Nicole sketched her. If she was busy working on her control and focus her mind would be too occupied to wander. </p>

		<p>"That would be perfect." A bright smile broke across Nicole's face. "Do you want to get that out of the way or focus on the project first?"</p>

		<p>"Might as well get the sketching done." Buffy smiled and reached for the workout clothes she'd brought with her. "I just need to get changed."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy was barely aware of any other sound than her own breathing and the irregular scratching of Nicole's charcoal and fingers against her sketch pad. They'd already gone through two fighting positions and one other meditation pose but despite herself Buffy had chosen the most difficult one for last. Pushed up into a handstand on top of two wooden pieces was the hardest of her poses but something inside of her wanted to show off. It was that prideful reality that constantly fought with her serenity and balance as she struggled to keep the pose.</p>

		<p>Her mind kept fighting itself as scenes played out and meshed into one another. Images of Angel melted into those of Riley and then for some reason into the very brunette who sketched her now. Trying to use the techniques Giles was teaching her she channelled the confusion down into her arms as she let the pictures flow out. Images of Willow with Oz and then in turn with Tara focused in on the two girls holding hands. Focused in our there hands, focused in on her hands holding a stake and then to her hand being taken by that of another. So many things flashed by her mind that focus became impossible and in a moment of panic she felt her arm slip sideways as she lost the position.</p>

		<p>"Buffy!" Nicole's concentration on her drawing broke as she looked up over the paper to see the blonde toppling over. There was only a short distance between them and she leaned forward the best she could trying to stop Buffy's fall. </p>

		<p>"Whoa!" Buffy felt all of her mind slam back into her body hard just in time to feel Nicole's hands reaching her and then her body hitting the hard floor. "Ouch." She spoke the one word weakly when her motion finally stopped.</p>

		<p>"Are you okay?" Nicole scrambled up off the ground angry with herself for being unable to stop the blonde's freefall. She began brushing long blonde hair off Buffy's face trying to see if she was injured. </p>

		<p>"Sorry, I lost focus." Buffy gave a brave smile as her vision cleared and was filled with Nicole's face. "I can get back into it in a minute or two."</p>

		<p>"No way." Nicole shook her head violently as she checked the Slayer for injury. "Did you hurt yourself? I should have told you to take a break, it's all my fault. I'm so sorry."</p>

		<p>"Nicole, I'm fine." Buffy smiled as she reached out to take Nicole's hands trying to still her movements. "Really I'm fine." </p>

		<p>They locked eyes for a moment, holding each other's look as time seemed to slow and go faster all at the same time. Suddenly Nicole pulled her hands away and leaned back so that Buffy could get up.</p>

		<p>"Sorry." Nicole apologized again as she scrambled up onto her feet.</p>

		<p>"It's okay Nic." Buffy sat upright quickly to show she was fine as she cursed herself for ever causing the brunette so much worry. "You should have seen the smacks I took when I was first learning. This was nothing." She tried to ease the situation.</p>

		<p>"I thought you'd hurt yourself." She tried to explain as she retreated and sat on the couch. </p>

		<p>"I didn't." Buffy followed her feeling a slight twinge in her elbow where she'd slammed it into the floor but nothing on earth would get her to tell Nicole that now. "And even if I did, I have this uncanny ability to heal fast so no worries."</p>

		<p>"Maybe we should take a break from the sketching and work on the project for a bit." Nicole smiled awkwardly at the blonde hoping her moment of weakness hadn't revealed anything.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>'You've done it again.' Buffy's mind snapped at her as the Slayer's consciousness came to realize that she was no longer sitting up but was in a completely horizontal position on her stomach on Nicole's couch. The numbness in her arm as it hung off the edge of the sofa gave her a hint to the fact that she'd been that way for along time.</p>

		<p>She kept her eyes closed and listened. Maybe if she was really lucky Nicole had fallen asleep too. Maybe at least she hadn't noticed but as her hearing tuned in to the now familiar sound of charcoal scratching Buffy knew she was caught.</p>

		<p>"Am I allowed to move or is this to be entitled 'Died of Embarrassment 2'?" Buffy opened one eye slowly.</p>

		<p>"Sorry?" Nicole looked up startled from the paper she worked on. "Of course you can move. It's just you looked so beautiful…" She rested the pad on her lap and smiled. "And peaceful."</p>

		<p>"Please tell me I didn't snore." Buffy rolled over and sat up in one graceful movement.</p>

		<p>"Only a little." Nicole laughed lightly. "And before you worry you've only been out a little while. Not even long enough for the pizza to get here, I was going to wake you when it came."</p>

		<p>"If I keep falling asleep on you, you're going to start thinking I find you boring." Buffy reached forward for her lemonade needing something to drink but her own words made her stop. "Not that I do. Just…" She tried to dig herself out of the instant hole she'd made herself.</p>

		<p>"I take it as a compliment." Nicole smiled at her again. "Means that you are comfortable around me." She too felt a sudden stiffness at her own words. "If that's okay."</p>

		<p>"I think that's the perfect way to take it." Buffy smiled back. Somehow this girl who knew nothing about who or what she was had gotten one of the truest facts of Buffy's life right. Being the Slayer meant always being ready for trouble and that way of life usually meant not sleeping soundly but almost every time she was with Nicole, no matter where they were, she kept falling into the deepest sleeps.</p>

		<p>"Must be the pizza." Nicole folded her pad closed as the doorbell rang and the sudden moment of silence between them was ended.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy looked out up from the last of her allotment of reading and studied the beginnings of dusk. As always she was reminded of the stark dichotomy that existed in her life. She had spent the day as any other college student would, studying and eating pizza but tonight she would pick up a stake and hunt the creatures of the night.</p>

		<p>'You live a weird life Buffy.' She laughed lightly at herself as she dragged the bright yellow highlighter across another interesting point in the article.</p>

		<p>"Something funny in there?" Nicole looked up from her own reading with a neon green highlighter tapping against her lower lip.</p>

		<p>"Oh no I was just thinking about…" She tried to find a cover for what she'd really been thinking. "How I really expected to be nervous about posing for you but it was really cool." She gave an honest smile.</p>

		<p>"You're stunning Buffy, you should never be nervous about posing." Nicole met the Slayer's eyes for a moment before she looked away. </p>

		<p>"I had clothes on, I can't imagine how much more nervous I would have been if I'd been…" Buffy eyes went wide as the thought sent a shot of steely cold all the way down to her toes that shot back up into her head as a fiery bolt. "Naked." The word came out of her slowly.</p>

		<p>"It's not like being naked, naked." Nicole felt herself blush slightly. "When you pose for an artist they are admiring you with the most purest of intentions. It's the best parts of love, lust and worship all rolled up into one without of any of the messy stuff." </p>

		<p>"Have you ever posed naked?" Buffy let the papers in her hand drop into her lap as she asked the question in a soft voice.</p>

		<p>"I sat a few times for a friend." Nicole played with the highlighter. "And as you said I was so nervous but it was such a free feeling. Knowing that she was drawing me, not clothes I'd bought or a certain pose that was meant to show off my eyes or something equally fabricated. She was just drawing me, just me."</p>

		<p>The artist's words seemed to hang in the air as the Slayer thought long and hard about them. </p>

		<p>"Sounds very free." She whispered finally.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but don't take my word for it." Nicole pushed herself to the end of the couch cushion as she began to pile up papers. "I'm just a hopeless old romantic who finds the best side of everything."</p>

		<p>"The world needs hopeless romantics." Buffy pushed herself to match the brunette's position on the end of the couch. "And you are a gorgeous hopeless romantic, so don't dare ever lose that."</p>

		<p>"You say the nicest things." Nicole turned to the Slayer and smiled.</p>

		<p>"Though I so hate to say this I have to go." Buffy glanced briefly to the ever-darkening sky before looking back to the brown eyes before her. </p>

		<p>"I've already used up most of your Saturday." Nicole nodded as she finished the pile. "And we've gotten tones of work done so you deserve to go out and have some fun."</p>

		<p>"Actually I have to work." Buffy looked away. She'd sewn these white lies to so many people in the past but for some reason continuously lying to Nicole was starting to bother her beyond belief. "What are you up too tonight?"</p>

		<p>"Got that deadline." Nicole grinned. "I'll be finishing up your charcoal's long into the night."</p>

		<p>"Don't wear yourself out." Buffy stood up and slung the strap of her bag over her head.</p>

		<p>"You either." Nicole pushed herself up as well. "So I'll see you later then."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, later." Buffy shuffled awkwardly as she passed her weight from one foot to the other before she headed for the door. </p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy kicked the tumbling stone again as it came to rest in front of her. Tonight had to be the most boring night on Slayer record. She'd already been patrolling for three hours and she hadn't seen a single solitary vampire, demon or even any of the lesser creatures that often ran from her and were of no harm to anyone. Even a trip by Willy's Place had led to absolutely nothing of interest. </p>

		<p>"You'd think something would show up to occupy your mind?" She threw the rhetorical question at a tree as she passed it. "Oh no not that." She felt the gait of her step slow a little as the picture of a certain brunette came into focus in her mind. </p>

		<p>She'd been trying to deny it for days now, ever since that first night they'd unexpectedly met at the club. She deluded herself at first, on purpose, that the only reason she found the slim brown haired girl's company so wonderful was because they'd both just gone through a similar heartbreak.
		</p>

		<p>'Come off it Buffy.' She laughed at herself as her mind slotted a long list of incriminating evidence against itself into place. </p>

		<p>The most glaring piece of all had been her unexpected talk with Willow the night before. Whether or not the hacker had been asking a lot about Nicole lately as she'd said was irrelevant when she gauged her own reaction to the perception. Especially when the truth was that she'd been trying to do just the opposite lately. So many times in conversation she'd wanted to comment on something that Nicole had said, or that they'd done but she'd purposely stopped herself in fear that Willow or Tara would call her on it. </p>

		<p>She'd never enjoyed psychology as much as she did now, knowing that the brunette would be holding her a seat as she had a class in the same hall right before that. Her notebook was filled with pages of their silent conversations scribbled between them as she tried to stay awake and Nicole tried not to be too bored with the professor's lecture.</p>

		<p>'Got yourself in a tight spot now Slayer.' </p>

		<p>Memories of her momentary breakdown the night before as she asked Willow the question that had been playing on her mind for ages made her face the large wall of evidence before her.</p>

		<p>'Maybe you're just looking for something that isn't really there.' She tried to figure out some other explanation. Maybe she was just mixing up her feelings because she was heartbroken and lonely. 'She's funny, intelligent, great to be around, amusing, a talented artist and…' She felt her mind go to a place she hadn't expected it to as she spoke softly to herself as she walked. "She's absolutely beautiful and she makes you totally forget any pain that Riley ever caused you because…" Her words came slower. "She makes you happy."</p>

		<p>Willow's words sounded out of her lips and made her stop walking as she wrapped her arms around herself. </p>

		<p>"It really is a big leap Will." She shuffled over to a nearby bench and sat down. </p>

		<p>A thousand questions went through her mind. She'd been shocked enough when Willow had revealed that she was in love with Tara, but now she was drowning in the her own shock as her body and mind responded to something she never expected to respond to. </p>

		<p>"And let's be realistic Buffy…" An angrier part of her mind, the lonely and desperate part of her that she rarely tried to give voice to swelled up quickly. "Just because she's gay doesn't mean she even likes you." </p>

		<p>"F-Fancy meeting you here." Tara shifted the heavy schoolbag on her shoulder a little as she meandered her way back from the library. </p>

		<p>"Tara." Buffy looked up having been too engrossed in her own conversation to even hear the blonde Wiccan approaching. </p>

		<p>"Tough patrol?" The shy girl sat down on the bench next to the Slayer trying to read the deep look of saddest Buffy's face.</p>

		<p>"Not a single slay." Buffy shook her head trying to act a bit brighter but unable to even find the energy.</p>

		<p>"Other things then?" Tara pushed slightly unable to bear the complete look of depression on the other blonde's face.</p>

		<p>"I just don't know what to do, what I want, I don't know anything." Buffy leaned forward and put her head in her hands. "I'm not sure if this is really something I can talk about Tara."</p>

		<p>"We can talk about something else then." The blonde tried not to push too much. "How did Nicole's sketching go?"</p>

		<p>"It went really well, except for when I lost focus and fell out of a meditation position." Buffy sighed as she sat back. "That's sorta the problem."</p>

		<p>"That you fell out of a meditation position?" Tara asked the simple question trying not to read anything into what the Slayer was saying until she had clear proof.</p>

		<p>"No, all I did then was scare Nicole." Buffy laughed lightly as she thought of the brunette's petrified face looming over her. "More that things went really well. I fell asleep again."</p>

		<p>"You and her are really getting along." Tara noted casually. </p>

		<p>"We are." Buffy nodded feeling very overwhelmed as her mind struggled with wanting to say so many things but another part of her edited them all out in fear of saying something stupid. "Sorta one of those people you feel you've known all your life."</p>

		<p>"I know what you mean. I felt that way about Willow when I first met her." The blonde smiled brightly. </p>

		<p>"Tara, this might come across as the most ignorant and horrible thing I've ever said but please I just need to ask." Buffy stood up and motioned for Tara to stay sitting. </p>

		<p>"Buffy, you can ask me anything." Tara folded her arms in her lap trying to prepare herself for any question. "And I know you'd never be horrible."</p>

		<p>"Can you picture me dating another woman?" Buffy just blurted out the question quickly before she could stop herself. She stared down at her friend demanding a clear and honest answer.</p>

		<p>"That's not mine to answer." Tara shook her head slowly knowing from the sudden falling look on Buffy's face that it was not the answer she wanted. "The only one who can really answer that is you."</p>

		<p>"But what if I don't know the answer?" Buffy sat down again and sighed heavily. </p>

		<p>"Well the first thing you have to remember is that just because you're asking yourself the question doesn't mean that the answer is yes." Tara turned towards the Slayer. </p>

		<p>"But it doesn't mean that the answer is no either." Buffy shook her head. "Let me just say it then." The hard edge within her took hold. "I like Nicole and sometimes I think I like her more than one normally likes a friend."</p>

		<p>"That's a perfectly okay way to feel Buffy." Tara reached out and rubbed her friend's shoulder. "How does it feel to say that?"</p>

		<p>"The truth is it feels better." Buffy felt herself breath a little easier. "I've been wanting to talk about it with Willow, but every time I went to bring it up I just froze. I feel horrible for saying this…"</p>

		<p>"But you don't want to have everyone thinking you're gay if you decide that you're not." Tara finished the sentence for her. </p>

		<p>"Common fear is it?" Buffy looked at her unable to believe how their roles had changed. Being the Slayer she was used to being the girl with answers but here was shy and quiet Tara being able to answer her biggest questions.</p>

		<p>"It's okay to be afraid." Tara smiled broadly at her. "And even though you might not think it, I'm sure that Nicole is even more scared then you are right now."</p>

		<p>"Why would she be? I'm not even sure if she feels the same." Buffy shook her head not convinced.</p>

		<p>"If she does like you Buffy, she's facing the knowledge that she has no chance with you." Tara filled in the obvious that Buffy was missing. "When I finally admitted I liked Willow it was torture, because as far as I knew she was as straight as they come."</p>

		<p>"I never thought about that." Buffy admitted leaning forward to put her head in her hand again. "It's all such a mess. She doesn't even know about the whole Slayer thing."</p>

		<p>"Maybe you need to decide first if you can trust her to tell her that and then figure out what else you want to happen from there." Tara tried to find an answer. </p>

		<p>"Well if she freaks out it'll be a pretty good sign that things won't work out between us." Buffy laughed lightly at her predicament.</p>

		<p>"But if she's able to understand and isn't abnormally freaked out about it maybe…" The blonde Wiccan left her statement open.</p>

		<p>"Maybe." Buffy nodded. "And I thought being a Slayer was a confusing enough."</p>

		<p>"I think its one of the bigger ones." Tara smiled. "Don't worry, you'll work it out." She was glad to see the Slayer finally smile back.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>It had taken her ages to make this decision. She'd lapped the block around the red brick building three times before she finally took her courage in her hand and walked up to the second floor and knocked on the small wooden door. It was late she knew that but this was something she needed to do right away or else she might never convince herself to do it again.</p>

		<p>"Buffy!" Nicole opened the door surprised. Her white v-neck shirt was covered in various smudges of charcoal, as where the cut off jean shorts she was wearing. </p>

		<p>"Hi, I hope it's not too late to drop by." Buffy felt very shy suddenly. </p>

		<p>"Of course not." The brunette stepped back out of the doorway and ushered the blonde in. "I was just working on the pictures."</p>

		<p>"I can see." Buffy turned and pulled at a thick stain of black that trailed down the front of the shirt. </p>

		<p>"I'm a messy artist." Nicole laughed and kept going into the living room. "Do you want a drink?"</p>

		<p>"Actually Nic, I needed to talk to you about something and I really just need to blurt it out here before I think of all the horrible ways you're going to react to this and decide not too." Buffy walked her way carefully around the supplies that littered the room and leaned against the glass door to the patio. </p>

		<p>"I'm listening." Nicole's face was blank and a little unsure as she waited for Buffy to continue.</p>

		<p>"I know you're not from Sunnydale, but as you might have noticed a lot of really weird and unexplainable things happen here." Buffy decided to just start right in. "People go missing all the time, there's lots of scary stories floating around and you might have even run into some strange things yourself." She took a quick breath. "Well the truth is Sunnydale is built over a Hellmouth, which to put it simply is a gateway to hell." She looked anywhere but Nicole's face. "And well that means the whole town is a magnet for all kinds of big bad creatures that I'm sure you were warned about when you were children but never thought really existed. A lot of them are vampires and that's where I come in."</p>

		<p>"You're the slayer." Nicole's voice broke through Buffy's rant softly.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, I'm the Slayer and my job is to kill all the evil things so that everyone else is safe…" Buffy was about to keep going when she realized what had been said. "How did you know that?" She finally looked at Nicole thrown by the huge grin the girl was wearing.</p>

		<p>"Buffy, I've known all along." Nicole shrugged her shoulders lightly. "Chris worked for the Initiative."</p>

		<p>"What?" The Slayer couldn't keep the shock out of her voice. </p>

		<p>"She was one of their communications experts, not a commando like Riley." The brunette felt herself cowering slightly under Buffy's stare. "She pointed you out to me one day when the whole thing broke up and explained what you did."</p>

		<p>"Sorry, I'm still trying to get my head around the fact you've known all along." Buffy sat down in a chair by the door. </p>

		<p>"You seemed to want to keep it too yourself and I learnt enough from being with Chris that it was better not to talk about stuff like that sometimes." Nicole bit her lip. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you."</p>

		<p>"I'm not upset, I'm just…" Buffy couldn't quite put a grasp on what she was feeling. If Nicole had known all along then it put everything into a slightly different category. </p>

		<p>"Buffy, it doesn't change who you are." Nicole stood up and walked over to where the blonde sat, kneeling down in front of her. "Because it's part of who you are. You are a brave and courageous woman who saves the world every night. I would have been able to tell you that even if I didn't know." </p>

		<p>"It makes me a freak really." Buffy shook her head. </p>

		<p>"No, let me show you." Nicole leaned across and plucked a large piece of paper from the table. "Look at her, really look at her." She held the drawing up for the Slayer to see. "She is not a freak, she is courage, she is bravery, and she is strength, love, passion and commitment." </p>

		<p>Buffy didn't see anything at first except herself in a high kick pose. Her arms pulled tight to her body as her left leg extended up high in the air. As her eyes traced the lines of the piece she was drawn up to the brown eyes of the artist before her. As she studied them for a moment her gaze again drifted down to the picture and clearing herself of all of her usual worries and insecurities she tried to really see. As the carefully drawn lines and precise shading came together and for the first time she really saw herself. </p>

		<p>"I want to pose for you." Buffy's voice shook as she spoke as she looked up again into warm chocolate eyes. "This is the Slayer, I want to pose for you." </p>

		<p>"Buffy, I don't think that would be a good idea." For the first time it was Nicole's voice that wavered as she realized what it was that was being offered to her and her own feeling screamed that she couldn't betray the Slayer in this way. "I…"</p>

		<p>"Nicole…" Buffy reached out and put her hands to the other woman's lightly blushed cheeks. "I've been afraid of this for so long but I'm not anymore. Please don't be afraid either."</p>

		<p>"I not afraid of this." Nicole reached up to cover one of the hands on her face with her own. "I just don't want you to do anything you're not sure about. I would kill me if I hurt you Buffy."</p>

		<p>"I want you to draw me Nic." Buffy rubbed her thumb down over the girl's cheek slowly and was amazed to see her eyes flutter close momentarily. "And I am prepared for the consequences of what I'm asking." </p>

		<p>"Just remember we can stop anytime." Nicole's soft voice was reassuring. "My robes' on the back of the bathroom door. Why don't you put that on while I get things ready in here." </p>

		<p>Buffy nodded mutely as she finally let her hands fall away and headed off towards the bathroom.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Buffy took one last look at herself in the mirror unable to believe just how confident she was feeling. Wrapped up now in only Nicole's long silky robe she didn't feel vulnerable or scared. She'd asked for this, created this moment and so far Nicole had responded in every way she needed. Taking a deep breath she strode out of the bathroom and back into the living room. </p>

		<p>She smiled at the new scene that had magically created itself while she'd been in the bathroom. Most of the furniture had been moved to the sides of the room to make way for a blanketed area complete with pillows that she assumed would become her spot. Nearby a myriad of Nicole's supplies had been stacked up ready for easy retrieve. The room was now fully lit in the soft glow of candles that concentrated in and around where she would be sitting. </p>

		<p>"It's my favourite light to work by." Nicole smiled shyly as she turned from her work to see the Slayer enter the room.</p>

		<p>"It's beautiful." She nodded softly. "That all for me?" </p>

		<p>"I couldn't have you uncomfortable now could I?" Nicole couldn't keep the smile from her face. </p>

		<p>"How do we start this?" Buffy asked innocently as she moved over and knelt down on the blanket.</p>

		<p>"Just like that." Nicole dropped silently down cross legged on the floor and picked up a soft dark pencil. "Always remember there's no rush Buffy, ever." She let her eyes roam over the Slayer's lean body as her hand began mapping out lines on the paper.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>It had been a slow progression and though Buffy didn't know what time it was she really didn't care either. The growing pile of drawings beside Nicole gave her some indication it had been awhile. Things between them had melted into a silent rhythm. She'd simply change positions whenever she was uncomfortable and Nicole would fluidity pick up a new piece of paper and begin a new sketch.</p>

		<p>She was on her side now, her hips and legs angled towards the floor as her upper body faced the artist. Nicole's robe was a memory that barely managed to hang on by the one edge that rested over her lower calf. Vaguely in her mind she registered that she was lying here completely naked but the most surprising fact was that it didn't make her nervous. Every second that Nicole's eyes traced over the curves and valleys of her body she watched those eyes. Watched how they saw every millimetre of her in its most basic form, listened to how she was being worshiped as the artist's hand moved quickly over the paper. </p>

		<p>There had been several times when the silence had seemed to much for a moment and she had almost broken it but like the artist had anticipated her subject's need, Nicole had looked up and held her eye for a moment. Her chocolate gaze softly saying all that the Slayer needed to hear. </p>

		<p>Knowing she'd been in this position for awhile, Buffy slowly shifted herself over onto her back and pulled the pile of pillows further under her head. She kept her arms up, as she bent one leg at the knee and turned her face back towards Nicole. As the artist abandoned her paper for another, Nicole looked up to appraise the Slayer's new position. </p>

		<p>"You look…" Nicole's voice came in a whisper as her hands for the first time stayed idle. </p>

		<p>"Your eyes have already told me everything." Buffy barely recognised the timbre of her own voice. "Why don't you take a break for a bit?" With a slight shake in her hand she reached out towards her artist. "Show me how good it can be to be free."</p>
