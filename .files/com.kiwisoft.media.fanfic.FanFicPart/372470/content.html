The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 14 by patricia51<p>Life had seemed to settle down for the Russo clan, including their new addition. School days followed weekends and Alex, kicking and streamlining inwardly at least, had started to enjoy school. Of course being in the same classes as Juliet made it much more tolerable. But the interest her "cousin" showed in all their classes seemed to perk Alex's own.<p>"I swear," grumbled the dark-haired girl to herself. "If I didn't love her so much I'd be tempted to turn her into a frog for turning me such a normal high school student. The next thing you know," she shuddered, "I'll be trying out for cheerleading." The thought was NOT a happy one.<p>The one thing that did bother her was that everyone had agreed that it was not the time or place to reveal the actual relationship that existed between her and Juliet. Alex chaffed at that. Accustomed as she was to speaking her mind immediately and openly about anything that crossed it she found it hard to keep quiet about the love she had for the ex-vampire teen.<p>At least in public. In private she found herself being drawn closer and closer to Juliet. She was practically unable to keep her hands off the other girl. Of course Juliet was not help in that respect. As demure as she appeared the long haired girl was capable of surprising Alex at the drop of, well, just about anything.<p>Saturday morning Alex had woke with a happy smile on her face. She had been having the loveliest dream involving Juliet. She slid her hand down her body under the covers determined to keep as long as possible the warm, sensual feeling that she was enjoying.   It was only when her fingertips encountered hair much, MUCH longer and thicker than they usually found between her legs that Alex realized she wasn't still dreaming. A muffled giggle reached her ears and the tongue that the teen wizardess thought she had been imagining stopped dancing over her and plunged inside of her. So instead of performing a solo dance her fingers were relegated to the minor but definitely enjoyable task of hold the other girl's face to her wetness. Then Alex closed her eyes and let Juliet's lips and tongue take her away to a place that was even better than her dream.<p>When Alex stopped thrashing and recovered her breath she peeked under the covers. Sure enough Juliet's grinning face greeted her; pursing her lips and blowing her a kiss. Then her girlfriend, in one of those graceful moves that always made Alex's mouth suddenly dry, slid up to snuggle with her and kiss her on the lips, imparting her own taste to Alex.<p>"You," Alex shook her head. "What in the world did you think you were doing?"<p>"You couldn't tell?' Juliet pretended to pout. "In that case maybe I should quit doing, well, that."<p>"You minx!" Alex laughed. "That beats an alarm clock any day. But where did you get the idea of waking me that way?"<p>"For a bit I didn't think you were going to wake up," Juliet laughed. "But to answer your question, I woke up first and was watching you, as I often do when you're still asleep. You had kicked off your covers and your t-shirt had worked its way up around your waist. By the way, you call me a minx and yet it seems that you forgot to wear panties when you went to bed.<p>Juliet chuckled as Alex's face turned dark red. "And besides, you started it."<p>"I did? How? Ohhhhh," Alex's blushed deepened.<p>"Exactly. When I slipped from my bed to yours I didn't think at first I was going to get your fingers out of the way. Then I wondered if I could actually make you orgasm and get back into bed before you woke up. Well, that didn't work. The getting back into bed part anyway."<p>"Well, it was a lovely way to wake up," admitted Alex. "But you just watch yourself. Payback's a you-know-what and I'll get you sooner or later."<p>"Promises, promises," scoffed Juliet.<p>"No brag, just fact."<p>The Tuesday and Thursday session in the Magic Lair increased in both length and intensity. This was due to no one person and wasn't planned. It just seemed to happen. Of course Juliet was scrambling to learn magic but the episode at the Late Nite Bite had given new meaning on the power of magic to the three Russo children. They were eager to explore the new limits of their abilities.<p>A new element that Jerry added to the training was for Justin, Alex and Max to work together. He emphasized how important it was that they discover how to complement each other.<p>"I know this seems very strange," he told them one day during a break. "You are learning each other's strengths and weakness. If it was one-sided it would give someone an unfair advantage in the competition when it occurs. But you are all learning each other and it allows you to fit together in this trio you have somehow formed. I don't know where this is leading," their Dad admitted, "But finding out is going to be something amazing."<p>Jerry also took time to work with Alex and Juliet as a pair. He explained why one afternoon.<p>"Most wizard couples keep their individual magic and their own magical style. However they often form a unique joint style that often bears no resemblance to either of their separate ones. Then there is the connection you have with your brothers Alex. How your magic, the magic you have with them AND with Juliet will all fit together I can't imagine." Seeing the worried look on both girls' faces Jerry hastened to continue. "Somehow it will though Alex. Magic has a way of finding its own place in you, its own level. The balance of things may swing wildly sometimes," he fixed Alex with a stern look, "Especially when certain people mess with that balance, but eventually the swings dampen out."<p>"Now then, let's get back to work."<p>The girls faced each other at about five feet. Each conjured a ball of light, Alex one of blue light and Juliet one of yellow. Each tossed their globe to the other. As soon as the oncoming ball was caught they changed the color to their own and tossed it back.<p>The tosses became faster. On Jerry's command each conjured a second ball and added it to the routine. Then a third. Back and forth the globes flew. The girls' concentration was fierce. Sweat broke out on Juliet's brow, mirrored soon by Alex.<p>"Get ready," warned Jerry. "Three, two, one. NOW."<p>Taking deep breaths the girls shut their eyes and continued tossing the flowing lights.<p>"Concentrate. Remember keep your mind on throwing the light to your partner. Don't worry about catching it. She will throw it to your hand. Trust her." Jerry's voice came through clean and clear, encouraging his girls.<p>Alex gritted her teeth. Her hands loved. She pictured the balls flying back and forth from her to Juliet. She concentrated on making each toss perfect. A rhythm crept into her movements, as though the beat of some far away music was reverberating in her mind. Somehow she sensed that Juliet was matching her timing perfectly. It was as if the two girls were dancing with each other.<p>"Alex, Juliet, on the count of three open your eyes. One... two... three."<p>Alex's eyes popped open, her hands still moving. She was looking directly into Juliet's warm brown eyes. Then those four eyes were drawn to the light still flashing back and forth between them and both girls gasped.<p>"They're GREEN!" Alex nearly shouted.<p>"Okay, stop," Jerry commanded.<p>The lights flickered and disappeared. Both girls sagged, released from the strenuous mental and physical efforts they had been putting out.<p>"What just happened Mr. Russo?" asked Juliet as she walked on slightly unsteady legs to cooler and retrieved three bottles of water. The trio sat down and each drank deeply of the cold water.<p>"I know!" exclaimed Alex. "Our powers blended. Just like I did with Justin and Max that day."<p>"Yes and no," replied her Father. "I still don't understand the union you have with your brothers. But this," he waved his hand towards where the two teens had been standing, "This was something I have been expecting, although not this fast." He looked at his daughter and then at her girlfriend. "This was a joining of spirits. This is what happens when two people who are meant to be together find that bond that will link them forever."<p>For once in her life Alex was completely stunned into silence. Her mouth hung open and her eyes blurred as what her Dad said sank in. It was the touch of Juliet's hand that brought her back to reality. Even then all she could say was "Wow.".<p>Jerry rose and hugged the girls. "It's okay Alex. This is important but it doesn't mean that you and Juliet are fastened at the hip forever. Perhaps you are soul mates, but magic doesn't decree things like that, it only shows what may be. The two of you will have to figure it out yourselves."<p>Her dad looked far away even as he squeezed them. "Remember, 'Happily Ever After' doesn't just happen. Magic might bring two people together but it takes work and dedication and effort to keep them a pair. Magic can show what the possibilities are but never lose sight of reality. And each other."<p>"Okay Daddy."<p>"Yes Mr. Russo."<p>A last squeeze left them nearly breathless. "Okay, enough lectures about, well, everything." At that moment the alarm indicating Wizard Mail sounded. "You two go get cleaned up for supper."<p>As the girls left Alex looked back and saw her Dad pluck the envelope that had just arrived from the table it had landed on. He opened it and started reading. Alex tried to interpret the look on his face. It was such a mixture she couldn't. Different emotions chased themselves across his face. Then Juliet was pulling her hand and they went upstairs to their room.<p>That evening at supper when the dishes were cleared away Jerry asked everyone to remain. He took out the envelope he had received this afternoon.<p>"Since the events of several weeks ago I have been in continuous touch with the Wizard's Council. As I thought at the time, the tremendous release of magical energy when Juliet became human and a wizard caught the attention of just about everyone."<p>"Since they first contacted me the Council has left the matter in my hands once I explained what had happened. This is why we have been working so hard individually, as a trio and as a pair. Today they asked if I thought you four were ready to talk to them, to show them what you are capable of doing. I told them yes."<p>A storm broke out as everyone attempted to speak at once. Jerry held his hand up for silence. He didn't get it but the noise subsided to a dull roar.<p>"Why didn't you tell us?" asked Justin. The other three nodded in agreement.<p>"To what end? It would have only made you nervous to think about it. The Council assured me they mean no harm, rather the opposite, they are intensely curious about what is happening here. They agreed to wait until I felt you all were ready. And you are. Trust me. If I wasn't completely sure of things they would still be waiting."<p>"When are they coming?" asked Alex.<p>"Saturday."<p>(To BE Continued)
