<!-- This Time Around \ Part Eighteen: Odd Slayer Out -->

<p>***Cemetery***</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith were patrolling, just like the old days. Ok they
weren't on the hellmouth, but it was almost like the old days. They
had left Willow, Tara, and Giles back at the house with Nadia, who
was telling them some stories about her watcher days. Faith was
still a little worried about Sam though. She couldn't believe it she
was patrolling with B, who was currently holding her hand (this was
her dream) and she was thinking about Sam. As Queen C would
say, "confusing much?"</p>
<p>And she was, confused that is. She knew she loved B. Has since the
first time she saw her. Plus they had that added bonus of slayer
connection. But so much had happened in their past together. Faith
still had a hard time believe that B had completely forgiven her.
But she had. And now here they were, patrolling, holding hands, and
Faith didn't want to be there. She wanted to be at Sam's house,
making sure she was ok, taking care of her till she was. </p>
<p>Buffy noticed Faith's distraction and decided to break the silence
that had fallen. "I've missed you Faith."</p>
<p>Faith looked at Buffy. So many times she wanted to hear those words,
but now they didn't mean anything. "Why did you guys come?"</p>
<p>Buffy looked a little disappointed at Faith's response, but went on
nonplused, "someone was looking into your files and background and
stuff. Digging where they shouldn't. So we came out here for Willow
to up security so to speak. Wouldn't want anyone to find out who you
now would we." Buffy added playfully, trying to keep the mood light.</p>
<p>"Naw wouldn't want that," Faith muttered darkly </p>
<p>"Faith is there something wrong?" Buffy asked. She hadn't seen the
depressing, dark side of Faith for a long time, and it scared her
when it popped out.</p>
<p>"Why now B?! Why come here and be all buddy buddy with me now?! You
couldn't of done this shit back in SunnyD.when I wanted you to?!"</p>
<p>Buffy stepped back as if she had been hit. In no uncertain terms
Faith had just told her she didn't want her anymore. She had waited
to long, and now she had lost her. The thought made tears spring to
Buffy's eyes. "I'm sorry.I.I."</p>
<p>Faith's face softened from the hard mask it had fallen into. "Sorry
B.I didn't meant ta yell at ya.it's just.you know."</p>
<p>Buffy walked up to Faith and put her hand lightly on her
cheek. "Yeah, I know." Rising up on her tippy toes Buffy pressed a
light kiss of Faith's lips, and then turned and walked away. Faith
sat down heavily on the nearest tombstone. She had just turned down
BUFFY. B had kissed her and she turned her away.</p>
<p>"Must be either fuckin' insane, or in love." Faith muttered to
herself before she got up and headed for home. On the way she
decided (for her own peace of mind) that it was love, not insanity.
Now all she had to was tell Sam.</p>
