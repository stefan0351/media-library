<p><b>Whoa, I didn't even expect to update this. It just happened.</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Lilly ~</p>
<p>I stretched out leisurely in the grass, my head resting on my duffel bag filled with clothes and tiny memories. It worked as a decent pillow and allowed me to relaxedly reflect on my first night in the rural town of Crowley Corners. It was desolate, just how I liked it, no one suspected me, it was peaceful, and I had plenty of privacy. Not to mention, there was a certain cowgirl who wouldn't leave the corner of my mind no matter how hard I tried to block her out. Her smile was so appealing and I looked forward to her finding me out here again. She had treated me with a charming courteousness and I couldn't help but think that even if she saw me lazing around the woods every day, she wouldn't change her attitude.</p>
<p>A familiar clopping noise filled the silence and I opened my eyes and glanced in the direction it was coming from. The sound was music to my ears and I waited with great anticipation for the horse to make its arrival. Just as expected, the white steed came through the brush with a smiling Miley on his back.</p>
<p>"Well, howdy," Miley greeted with a tip of her hat. Unwanted elation coursed through my veins as I climbed to my feet and strolled without fear right up to the horse, petting his muzzle with affection.</p>
<p>"Hi, Miley," I said with a timid smile, dropping my hand. But to my shock, the horse lowered his head and prodded my fingers with the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>"Wow, Blue Jeans has sure taken a real shine to you," Miley noted delightedly. "So, how's the exploration comin' along today?"</p>
<p>"It's going great! I'm just taking a break right now... But you know what? I think I heard some howling this morning. Do you have wolves around here?" I wondered, trying not to feel proud about how cunning I could be.</p>
<p>"Actually, they're pretty rare in this area. I guess we have a loner runnin' around, but I'm certain it won't cause any harm. There's plenty of animals here in the woods for it to eat, so it hopefully won't be eatin' any of the live stock on the farm."</p>
<p>"You're probably right, but you should still be careful. I mean, a wolf wouldn't hesitate on taking a bite out of someone as fine as you," I said, my bluntness surprising even me. Humiliated, I quickly averted my eyes to the ground. Miley giggled, but I still couldn't look at her.</p>
<p>"How sweet... I better get back home. Daddy doesn't like me taking too long on my joyrides," Miley informed with genuine regret, tugging Blue Jeans' reins lightly.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll see you around, maybe!" Maybe? More like definitely.</p>
<p>"Yep. Take care," she called and the second Miley was gone, I dove into the bushes without another thought.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Miley ~</p>
<p>Blue Jeans fidgeted as I mucked out his stall, shovelling out the filthy hay, dust covered apple cores and other nasty soil coloured waste. There were two more to do after his one, I reminded myself sourly. I hated it when it was my turn to do the cleaning chores, but thrived off of it when it was Jackson's turn. One of the highlights of my life was watching my idiot brother suffer. We'd torment each other constantly and while I was usually very tolerant of his behaviour, I did lose it on occasion.</p>
<p>It was easy to escape my family of two when things were weighing me down though. I found solace in high places, so when life's hardships took their toll, I was either found hiding in a tree or on the roof of the house. I have this idea that if I go as high as I possibly could, I'd be that much closer to my mother and knowing that relaxed me some.</p>
<p>Something nudged my calf and I sighed with slight irritation. "Not now Blue Jeans, I haven't finished yet. You can come back in later. Be patient," I ordered, but the nudge came again. Deciding to let my horse figure it out on his own, I continued with my work. But then something slimy tickled my elbow and a small growl rumbled behind me. My spine tingled as shivers licked down it and I turned to see the wolf from the previous night standing in the entrance of the horse stall, tail swishing, and eyes curious.</p>
<p>"You came back, did you Princess? I hope you're not expecting me to feed you again. Daddy will become very suspicious if he keeps finding his steaks missing," I chided, removing one of my gloves to pat Princess' head affectionately. The wolf let out a small bark and moved deeper into the stall, digging at the remaining mess I had yet to remove. She slid further back with each swipe of her claws and finally had arranged a small pile of muck next to mine.</p>
<p>I stared in astonishment at the creature, then fell to my already dirtied knees, and ran my fingers appreciatively through the side of her neck before hugging the animal with a soft smile. Her fur smelt strangely clean and I couldn't hold back a chuckle.</p>
<p>"You are just the cutest thing, you know that? It's like you've been trained or something. Have you, girl? Have you run away from someone who used to teach you these things?" I released the wolf and met its eyes, stunned by just how expressive they seemed. They were almost human. "Well, wherever you came from, I'm glad you ended up here. Come on, you can help me clean the rest of the stalls." I stood up and placed my gloves back on my hands and reached for the shovel, smiling in amazement as my new friend did her little digging routine again.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I glared at Princess as she trailed behind me, ears drawn and tail stiff between her legs. "No, girl. You can't come to school with me. I've told you already, go back home," I said. It appeared to get through to her this time and she stood still, but when I took a few steps forward, she followed me again. "Princess!" I yelled in frustration. That seemed to do it and she sat down, her head lowered and eyes wide. "No... not the puppy dog eyes... You can't use my own move against me," I whined, but her features remained sorrowful. I groaned and stomped up towards her, leaning down so we were eye level. "You know, I can't be mad at you for long. I love you, okay? Just be a good girl and stay away from the school. If people see you, they might call animal patrol. I don't want you taken from me," I explained and I could only hope she'd understand. I'd grown so fond of this wolf and the idea of her being put down or shipped across the country frightened me. I kissed her cold nose and then continued down the dirt road towards my cramped school.</p>
<p>I made it just on time and as I seated myself in homeroom, relieved to be rid of my heavy bag filled with completed summer homework, someone called out to me. I faced the door and there was Travis, one of my best friends, walking up to me.</p>
<p>"Hey Travis! I've missed you! How was it at your dad's place?" I asked, not forgetting he had left me for the entire summer to stay at his dad's house a few towns over.</p>
<p>"Awkward, to say the least. It wasn't very fun, but I do love that man. I missed you too," he added, grinning widely, his blue eyes crinkling slightly. They reminded me of another pair that plagued my mind often... That Lilly girl I encounter in the woods almost every day has a similar eye colour to Travis. She was an utter mystery to me. For one, I had no idea if she even went home during the night and every time she sees me, there's just something about the way her face lights up that seems familiar. She intrigues me, but she's always in some kind of rush to be somewhere. Whenever I invite her over, she smiles at me as if my asking was funny to her, and politely declines my offer. She undoubtedly has some secrets hidden away in her enigmatic mind and I intend to find out what they are.</p>
<p>"So, did anything exciting happen to you during the summer?" Travis asked and I wondered if I should tell him about Princess and Lilly.</p>
<p>"Yes, actually. A wolf found its way onto my farm," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh, really? Did it kill anything? What'd Robbie do?"</p>
<p>"Uh, daddy doesn't exactly know about it. The poor thing was eating out of the pig trough and didn't even touch the animals. She's actually tame, Travis. I dunno where she came from, but she's like some super intelligent dog."</p>
<p>"Miley, you know your dad won't believe that. He's gonna find out and he's gonna call the exterminator. A wolf is a threat and a pest around here." I scowled.</p>
<p>"Princess is different! She wouldn't hurt a fly! And daddy won't find out 'cause she's real sneaky and we're never easily spotted from the house," I said with certainty, confident in my ability to keep Princess' presence on the farm on the down low.</p>
<p>"Whatever you say Miles..."</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I kicked a rock angrily as I made my way home, annoyed by what Travis had said. It hadn't left my head all day and now I was very worried about what would happen to Princess if daddy found out about her, which he wouldn't! But what if he did...</p>
<p>"Hey, Miley!" Shit. That voice. That horrid voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah, hey." Ah, correction, horrid <i>voices</i>.</p>
<p>"What do you two want?" I questioned, my words clipped as I gave the two girls a sideways glance.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing... We just wanted to know how your summer working on your farm like the regular male hick went."</p>
<p>"It went fine, Amber. Now leave me alone."</p>
<p>"Psh, honestly, I don't see why Travis would go out with someone like you. You're just like any other dirty hillbilly around here," Amber sneered and my fists clenched, begging to be plunged into that snooty girl's face. Seriously, it's like her family just moved here to flaunt their money in everyone else's faces. They hated the townsfolk, refused to talk to them, and thought anyone with an accent was as dumb as a mule that had taken one too many blows to the head.</p>
<p>"We're just friends, I've told you that a million times." She went to counter with another stupid insult, but was interrupted by a distant snarl coming from across the road. The three of us looked to see a blonde fur ball speeding at us with its fangs bared. Amber and Ashley shrieked simultaneously and ran for it, but that didn't stop the growling blur from charging after them, snapping at their designer handbags. It caught Amber's in its jaws and tore the expensive looking purse to shreds, including her phone and anything else that she had kept in there.</p>
<p>"You stupid mutt!" she screamed, kicking Princess in the side. The wolf let out a vicious growl and she yelped, turning and running after Ashley, who hadn't stopped even when her friend was attacked.</p>
<p>When they were long gone, Princess trotted up to me with Amber's phone in her mouth. She dropped the device to the ground and stared up at me with an almost amused expression.</p>
<p>"You naughty girl," I said happily, petting her head in thanks.</p>
