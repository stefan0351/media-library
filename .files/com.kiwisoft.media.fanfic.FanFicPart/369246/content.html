<p><b>Chapter 3</b></p>
<p>Lilly stole a glance at the girl by her side. She was incredibly excited and this time the sweltering heat hardly bothered her. She'd been bored out of her mind at home, grudgingly helping her mom rearrange the furniture for the fifth time, when Miley had shown up out of the blue. Her mother had been happy enough that Lilly had already found a friend and let her go with Miley. Together they were walking along a dirt path, past a meadow and though it was quite nice, Lilly wondered where the girl was taking her. Miley had been strangely silent so far, though the look on her face was happy and relaxed. It put Lilly at ease – at least she didn't think Miley was taking her into the woods to murder her.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" asked Lilly, looking at her companion. Miley's long hair fell in waves down her back and Lilly wanted to run her fingers through it. She resisted the urge, just as she resisted all her urges when it came to Miley.</p>
<p>"I'm showing you the sights," said Miley happily, swinging her arms. Lilly found her happiness to be contagious and couldn't help but grin. Though in reality, she felt herself smile a lot around the other girl. Maybe it was that army of butterflies marching through her stomach every time she looked at Miley. Maybe it was the way her heart skipped beats when Miley smiled.</p>
<p>"Where are these sights?"</p>
<p>Miley spread her arms, grinning. "This, right here."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled wryly. "So you're saying Crowley Corners is a whole lotta nothing?"</p>
<p>Miley elbowed her slightly and it made Lilly's insides churn. Why couldn't she keep her stupid hormones in check? Miley was incredibly nice and here she was ruining it by having less than pure thoughts about her. Suddenly, Miley grabbed Lilly's hand and pulled her into the thicket. There was a small, beaten path, but Lilly never would have seen it walking by. Miley was still pulling her by the hand and Lilly swallowed hard, trying to concentrate on where they were going. Miley's hand was warm and soft and perfect. After a little while they stopped on the edge of a small cliff. Lilly looked down tentatively. There was a small lake just below, connected on two sides to a creek that vanished in the woods. A few kids seemed to be swimming down below.</p>
<p>"This is the creek; everyone goes swimming here in the summer. Some people like to jump off this cliff," said Miley and her voice sounded almost wistful. Lilly looked around them. The trees and brush were thick up here and there was just enough space for a few people on the lip of the cliff. Below, next to the creek, there seemed to be a lot more space, not to mention, no deathly heights to fall from.</p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow. "Do <b>you</b> jump off the cliff?"</p>
<p>Miley merely grinned and shrugged, but Lilly knew she did. She just hoped she'd never have to see it – she was afraid of heights. "Why are we up here? Can't we go down where everyone else is?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, not meeting her eyes. "It's peaceful up here, no one to bother you." She finally looked up and she no longer looked happy like she had before. Lilly wished she hadn't asked. Miley bit her lip and Lilly had already figured out she did this when she wasn't sure what to do. "I can take you down there if you want."</p>
<p>Lilly had also figured out whenever Miley seemed to be torn over something, she always acquiesced to what Lilly wanted. She shook her head and sat in the dirt, though a safe distance away from the edge of the cliff. Miley smiled, relief clearly evident on her face, and sat next to Lilly. A slight breeze ruffled their hair and up here, in the shade, it was quite nice. Lilly took a deep breath of the air and closed her eyes. It really <b>was</b> peaceful up here.</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes again, she found Miley staring at her. Her gaze was intense and she didn't even look away when Lilly met her eyes. Miley merely smiled, as if staring was completely normal.</p>
<p>"You're really pretty, Lilly."</p>
<p>Lilly nearly choked. Was Miley checking her out or was that just wishful thinking? So far Miley had given no signs she was gay. Miley was still smiling, her head resting sideways on her drawn-up knees. Lilly's insides were mush, her brain was melting. She swallowed hard. "Uh, thanks."</p>
<p>She wanted to say something about how beautiful Miley was, about how her heart raced when the girl was near, but the words wouldn't come. Miley was already looking away and Lilly wanted to kick herself. She'd had the perfect opportunity and she'd blown it. Thunder rolled in the distance and Lilly looked out across the tree line. Something tugged on her arm and she looked at Miley, getting up. The girl's face was pale and Lilly frowned.</p>
<p>"We gotta go, right now." She had never heard Miley's voice like that. She normally always sounded a bit teasing, happy, even if her eyes were sad, but now it almost sounded scared. Lilly didn't know what to think, but let herself be pulled up regardless.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Thunder sounded again, far away, and Lilly could've sworn she saw her friend flinch. Miley grabbed her hand again and practically dragged her out of the woods, back to the dirt path.</p>
<p>"Let's just go. Is it okay if we go to my place? It's closer. Or I can walk you back to your place if you want." Miley was biting her lip again, but Lilly could easily tell how nervous the girl suddenly was. Miley's palm was sweaty.</p>
<p>She shrugged. "Your place is fine."</p>
<p>Miley seemed relieved, again, and took off along the path. It wound around the tree line and sloped downwards. Open land was all there was before them. Miley was walking briskly and though Lilly had no problem keeping up, she wondered why. It thundered again and Lilly thought she felt the first rain drop. Miley picked up her pace. She kept glancing at her worriedly and Lilly wanted to reassure her. She didn't mind a little bit of rain.</p>
<p>Miley took a sudden left and pulled Lilly through the trees, until they broke through on the other side. There was a paved road, but no cars were in sight. Miley crossed it and climbed the low fence on the other side. Lilly looked at her skeptically. Miley managed her first smile in what seemed like forever.</p>
<p>"It's alright; it's my grandma's land. Come on."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't need the help, but took Miley's hand anyway to get off the fence. The pasture they were on seemed endless, though Lilly thought she saw some buildings off in the distance. More raindrops landed on them and Miley started running. Lilly kept up easily and soon they were close enough for Lilly to see the buildings. Miley slowed down slightly, out of breath, and the way her chest rose and fell rhythmically mesmerized Lilly. The rain picked up and Miley tugged on her arm urgently.</p>
<p>Trees dotted the area where the buildings stood, but as they got closer Lilly noticed that where the main building should have been was merely a construction site. A barn sat just off to the side, though its entire front and side were charcoal black, as if it had fought off a fire. She wanted to ask what had happened, but Miley pulled her past the buildings without a word and towards a much smaller one along the path. It looked a little like a cottage. They reached the front door just as the rain started in earnest. Miley pulled her through the door, laughing and Lilly looked at the girl. The panic from just minutes ago seemed to be gone.</p>
<p>Drops of water clung to Miley's hair and skin and Lilly almost reached out a hand to brush them away. A loud voice stopped her, however, and both girls turned where they stood in the entranceway. "Miley Ray Stewart, I have told you a <b>thousand</b> times not to go outside during a storm! Why do you have to defy me all the time?"</p>
<p>Miley's face fell and Lilly shifted nervously; she hadn't yet made up her mind about Miley's mom. Miley walked further into the room towards her mother, who grabbed her shoulders as if to shake her.</p>
<p>"It's fine, mom. I came home as soon as it started," said Miley defiantly. Her mother sighed and shook her head. It seemed as if she was about to say something else, but then noticed Lilly still in the entranceway. The woman stood straighter, letting go of Miley.</p>
<p>"Hello, Lilly, I didn't know you were here." Lilly couldn't tell by the woman's voice whether she thought her presence was a bad thing. She felt incredibly awkward and wished she'd asked Miley to go to her house instead. But that scared look in Miley's eyes had been her deciding factor. Had Miley been so scared because of what was to await her at home?</p>
<p>Lilly tried to push the thoughts aside. "Hello, Mrs. Stewart."</p>
<p>The woman smiled slightly and sighed again. Judging by her look she was not entirely thrilled with Lilly's presence, though Miley seemed to either not care or not notice. The girl returned to Lilly's side and grabbed her hand again. "We're gonna go to my room, momma."</p>
<p>"Alright, hun, but dinner's in an hour. Lilly, are you staying?"</p>
<p>Maybe the entire family was weird, Lilly decided. The woman clearly wasn't keen on Lilly hanging out with her daughter, but was inviting her for dinner nevertheless. Maybe it was a Southern thing. "I can't, my mom's very strict about family dinner time. Thank you, though."</p>
<p>Susan nodded. "Alright, well, once the rain clears Miley can drive you home."</p>
<p>Lilly managed a polite smile, but Miley was already dragging her to one of the closed doors off to the side. She shut the door behind them and Lilly looked around the room. It was very small, just big enough for a twin sized bed and a desk crammed against the opposite wall. She immediately noticed the various band and musician posters on the walls. A guitar sat in one corner. She motioned at it, "Do you play?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded, though her face was solemn, "Yeah, my daddy taught me how to play."</p>
<p>"Are you any good?"</p>
<p>This made Miley grin slightly. "My mom and grandma think so, but they have to say that." She shoved some clothes off the bed and motioned for Lilly to sit.</p>
<p>"Well, if you want, I'll be your judge. Then you'll know for sure." Lilly smiled and Miley sat down next to her. Considering the size of the bed, Miley did sit <b>right</b> next to her and their legs and arms were pressed together, making Lilly's breath hitch. She turned her head only to be met with Miley's staggering blue eyes. She could not help but be mesmerized by this girl. No one had ever affected her like this, with the stupid things she said and the nervousness and the excitement thrumming inside her body. But no one had ever been like Miley and Lilly doubted anyone ever would be again. Now if only she could figure out the mystery this girl was.</p>
<p>She averted her eyes, unable to stand the intensity any longer. Her eyes scanned across the room and landed on the desk. She noticed multiple schoolbooks and remembered Miley didn't go to Beauford County High. "Hey Miley, what school do you go to? I haven't seen you at County."</p>
<p>Miley bounced a little on her bed, following Lilly's gaze to her books. "Oh, I'm home schooled."</p>
<p>Another thing to add to my list of things that don't add up, Lilly thought. Miley didn't seem sick and her family didn't appear to be crazy religious fundamentalists, and those were the only people she'd ever seen home schooled. "That must be fun, not having to deal with teachers and rules all day?"</p>
<p>Miley grinned sheepishly. "My grandma will skin my hide if I don't do my work. She mostly teaches me, or my mom when she's not working. Sometimes they'll get a tutor for some subjects they're not real familiar with. It's alright, I guess."</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't imagine being home schooled, having to be around her mother all day, stuck inside the house. She shook her head, "Doesn't it get lonely? I mean, just doing school work by yourself?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged as if she hadn't thought about it, but Lilly could tell by her face she had. "I like being by myself."</p>
<p>"Then what are you doing with me?"</p>
<p>Miley smiled. "I like being with you more."</p>
<p>The statement was innocent, but so sincere Lilly felt a lump in her throat. Without thinking, she reached for Miley's hand between them and clasped it tightly. Realizing what she was doing, Lilly almost pulled back, but Miley merely smiled brighter. Lilly relaxed, returning the smile. They were silent for a while, just staring into each other's eyes, then Miley looked away.</p>
<p>"The rain stopped. I better take you home."</p>
<p>Lilly followed her gaze to the window behind them. Rays of sunshine were breaking through and she sighed. She didn't want to move, ever. Nevertheless, she followed Miley out of the house.</p>
<p>"You have a car?" She doubted it, judging by the tiny space the girl lived in.</p>
<p>"We just have my grandma's old truck. It's older than me, but still runs. Hop on in," said Miley as they approached the vehicle.</p>
<p>Lilly looked at it skeptically, wondering whether she wasn't safer just walking home. But the grin on Miley's face and the gleam in her eyes wouldn't allow her to leave. She got into the truck and they pulled away. Lilly couldn't take her eyes off Miley the entire drive back to her house.</p>
