<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 13: Going Back and Moving Forward - Part 2-->

<P>Across town, Giles returned to the boarding house. He opened the door, stuck his head in, and looked around. There was no sign of anyone, and it was silent. </P>
<P>"Quentin?" He asked. He received no answer.</P>
<P>He stepped in and closed the door, wary. He went into the sitting room. Everything was normal. He walked back out and down the hall, looking up the stairs. Still normal, but too quiet for him not to suspect something. He took a few steps up to the landing.</P>
<P>"Hello? Quentin? Hob..."</P>
<P>He noticed that the stair railing felt wet, and looked at his hand. It was covered with fresh blood. From the landing he looked into the other room and saw the closed crate standing there. He rushed down the stairs and looked for a weapon. He grabbed one of the stair rail supports and broke it out with the heel of his other hand. He headed for the crate, ready to face Kralik, but it was empty. </P>
<P>Worried now, he looked around and then down at the floor. He saw tracks of blood leading into the kitchen. He followed them, holding his makeshift stake up. He grabbed the doorknob and swung it open, but nothing was there. He searched for the light switch, and flipped it on. </P>
<P>He saw what was left of one of Quentin’s assistants lying on the table. He immediately dropped the stake, backed out of the kitchen, put his hand to his mouth and tried his best not to vomit. Quickly, he regained his composure and left the house.	</P>

<P>Joyce had just gotten home from the gallery, and was about to go get a shower when she heard a knock at the door. She opened the front door, and stepped out onto the porch.</P>
<P>"Buffy?" She asked, thinking it might be her daughter.</P>
<P>She got no answer, and started to look around for who might’ve knocked at her door. Seeing no one, and thinking it was probably kids playing a prank, she started to turn around. Before she knew what was happening, someone appeared behind her and clamped a hand over her mouth.</P>
<P>"Mother." Kralik said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Back in Willow’s room, she and Buffy were laying under the covers. She was running her hand through Willow’s hair, and Willow was resting her head on Buffy’s chest.</P>
<P>"I don’t think I’ll ever be the same again." Willow said.</P>
<P>"That’s a good thing, right?"</P>
<P>"Definitely. I never realized how…"</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Intimate it was." Buffy gave her an amused but understanding look. "I mean…I thought I knew you pretty well, but when…I feel like you’re a part of me now."</P>
<P>"You felt that, too?" </P>
<P>Willow nodded.</P>
<P>"It was the most amazing thing…"</P>
<P>"I’ve ever experienced." Buffy finished Willow’s thought.</P>
<P>Willow sighed, happy, and sat up a little.</P>
<P>"When we leave here we’re going to have to face life again, aren’t we?"</P>
<P>"Unfortunately. Things will change, but we won’t. I promise."</P>
<P>Willow smiled at her. "Can’t we just stay here forever? It’s perfect right now."</P>
<P>"We can try. I’ll do whatever I have to do to make sure this isn’t the last perfect moment we have. But right now, I don’t wanna go anywhere."</P>
<p>"Good cause I don’t want you to either."</P>
<p>"Lay with me."</P>
<p>Willow started to lower herself back into a laying position, when they heard a knock at the door.</P>
<p>"How did I know that was coming?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>The knocking became more insistent.</P>
<p>"I guess I should answer it." Willow slowly got up, slipping on clothes.</P>
<p>"Hang on, I’ll go with you."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>When they finally answered the door, Giles rushed in, frantic.</P>
<p>"Giles?" Willow asked, suddenly blushing.</P>
<p>Buffy smiled at Willow. "What’s wrong?" </P>
<p>"I have something to tell you, Buffy." He said.</P>
<p>"You wanna sit down first?" Willow asked, leading them to the couch.</P>
<p>"Yes, thank you."</P>
<p>They sat down, and Giles took his glasses off.</P>
<p>"You know what’s wrong with me, don’t you?"</P>
<p>"Yes." He got the box that contained the needle, out of the inside of his jacket. </P>
<p>"What’s that?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>Giles opened the box, and they saw its contents.</P>
<P>"It's an organic compound... of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressers. The effect is temporary. You'll be yourself again in a few days."</P>
<P>Buffy was trying to grasp what he said.</P>
<P>"You?" She asked, her happiness fading fast.</P>
<P>"It's a test, Buffy. It's given to the Slayer once she...well, if she reaches her eighteenth birthday. The Slayer is disabled and then entrapped with a vampire foe whom she must defeat in order to pass the test. The vampire you were to face...has escaped. His name is Zachary Kralik. As a mortal, he murdered and tortured more than a dozen women before he was committed to an asylum for the criminally insane. When a vamp..."</P>
<P>Buffy was shaking, and she didn’t seem to register anything. Willow saw her, and felt her anger build. Before she knew what she was doing, she slapped Giles across the face. Buffy looked up at him finally.</P>
<P>"You bastard. All this time, you saw what it was doing to me. All this time, and you didn't say a word?"</P>
<P>"I wanted to."</P>
<P>"Liar." She choked.</P>
<P>"In matters of tradition and protocol, I must answer to the Council."</P>
<P>"She’s more important then the Council. We’ve gone three years without them, and then the minute they call you, you go running. I thought you cared. You were supposed to be our friend. She’s right. You are a liar. She could’ve gotten killed." Willow said with venom in her voice.</P>
<P>Giles had never heard Willow speak so angrily. If he weren’t so hurt by her words, he would’ve admired the way Willow was protecting Buffy.</P>
<P>"My role in this... was very specific. I was to administer the injections and to direct you to the old boardinghouse on Prescott Lane."</P>
<P>"I can't... I can't hear this." Buffy said, crying openly.</P>
<P>Willow embraced Buffy.</P>
<P>"Buffy, please."</P>
<P>"Who are you? How could you do this to me?"</P>
<P>"I am deeply sorry, Buffy, and you have to understand..."</P>
<P>He reached out to her, but she warned him off.</P>
<P>"If you touch me, I'll kill you."</P>
<P>"You have to listen to me. Because I've told you this, the test is invalidated. You will be safe now, I promise you. Now, whatever I have to do to deal with Kralik... and to win back your trust..."</P>
<P>"You stuck a needle in me. You poisoned me!"</P>
<P>Willow glared at Giles, and then went to go get tissues off the table.</P>
<P>"If this guy’s out…I have to go home."</P>
<P>"You can't walk home alone, Buffy. It isn't safe."</P>
<P>Willow handed Buffy some tissues.</P>
<P>"Then take me home."</P>
<P>"I don’t – " He started.</P>
<P>"I’m not listening to you anymore. Take me home."</P>
<P>Buffy walked to the door, followed by Willow.</P>
<P>"Buffy?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, Will?" She was sniffing.</P>
<P>"Whatever you’re going to do…be careful, okay?"</P>
<P>"I will."</P>
<P>"I mean it, Buffy. I know how you get when you’re upset. You take more risks. I…just don’t want to lose you."</P>
<P>"You won’t." Buffy kissed her, and walked out the door.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Giles pulled up to the front of Buffy’s house, and she got out, and shut the door.</P>
<P>"Perhaps I should wait…"</P>
<P>"Just go."</P>
<P>"Buffy please…"</P>
<P>"You can’t make this better, Giles. Especially now. Go."</P>
<P>He waited a few seconds and drove off. Buffy watched the car go, and walked up to her front door. She saw a Polaroid taped to the door. It was of her mother with Kralik, and he was holding her by the neck. On the back, the word, ‘Come’ was written.</P>
<P>Buffy ran inside to get supplies, and then started to make her way to the boardinghouse.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Mother." Kralik said to a tied and gagged Joyce, in the basement of the boardinghouse. He was snapping pictures of her. "May I call you Mother? My own mother was a person with no self-respect of her own, so she tried to take mine."</P>
<P>Joyce turned her head away from him, and he took another picture. She strained against the ropes around her arm, but they were too tight.</P>
<P>"Ten years old, she had the scissors. You wouldn't believe what she took with those. But she's dead to me now. Mostly…because I killed and ate her, but also because I know I won't be alone much longer. </P>
<P>"I'll have your daughter. I won't kill her; I'll just make her like me. Different. She'll go to sleep, and when she wakes up, your face will be the first thing she eats."</P>
<p>He looked at Joyce’s terror-filled face.</P>
<P>"I have a problem with mothers. I'm aware of that."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Giles was in his office trying to call someone on the phone. Quentin entered the office, and Giles put the phone down.</P>
<P>"I was just trying to reach you." </P>
<P>"I was on watch over by the boardinghouse." </P>
<P>"Then you know what's happened."</P>
<P>"Yes."</P>
<P>"He's killed Hobson and made Blair one of his own. Your perfectly controlled test seems to have spun rather impressively out of control, don't you think?" Giles asked angrily.</P>
<P>"It changes nothing."</P>
<P>"Well, then, allow me. I've told Buffy everything."</P>
<P>"That is in direct opposition to the Council's orders."</P>
<P>"Yes. Interestingly, I don't give a rat's ass about the Council's orders. There will be no test."</P>
<P>"The test has already begun. Your Slayer entered the field of play about ten minutes ago."</P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P>"I don't know. I returned there just as she entered."</P>
<P>Giles grabbed his keys from his desk and started out of the office. Quentin tried to stop him.</P>
<P>"Now Giles, we've no business..."</P>
<P>Giles grabbed him by the coat and shoved him up against the doorframe.</P>
<P>"This is not business!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>The front door of the boardinghouse opened quietly, and Buffy looked in. She had her crossbow up and ready. The front rooms were empty and quiet, so she stepped in. She took one of her stakes out the bag she brought with her and put it down between the door and the frame to keep it open. </P>
<P>Again she raised her bow and looked around the front rooms. She stepped in further and looked through the archway into the sitting room. She walked once around the room and then sat her bag down on the old couch. She continued to explore the area quietly. She approached a door and cautiously took hold of the knob. Quickly she twisted it and pulled the door open, only to find that it was bricked up on the other side. She closed it.</P>
<P>A hand reached down and picked up the stake she left to keep the door open. The door closed and the latch echoed loudly. Buffy spun around to face the noise. She didn’t see Blair, the ex-assistant now vampire, take the stake and go hide in the shadows.</P>
<P> Buffy slowly moved back into the foyer. She looked around before entering, then went back over to the door to check it. She found it locked shut. She yanked at it several times, but it didn't budge. Blair came up behind her and growled. She spun around and aimed the crossbow at him. She pulled the trigger, but the bolt flew right past his face. Blair grabbed the bow, jerked it out of her hands and threw it down. He grabbed her by the throat and started to choke her. </P>
<P>Buffy grabbed onto his arm and stomped on his foot. He let go. She shoved him aside and ran into the sitting room. She opened her bag and tried to reach in, but Blair reached for her over the back of the couch. She jumped away and ran to the far wall by the bookcase. Blair moved to follow, but she pushed the bookcase over on top of him. He struggled underneath it, and couldn't lift it off. </P>
<P>Buffy climbed over it and went to her bag, opened it and reached in. Blair reached out from under the bookcase and grabbed her ankle. She screamed and looked around for a weapon. She saw andirons, grabbed the tongs and started to whack Blair's arm. She hit him several times and he finally let go. She grabbed her bag and ran out of the room. She stopped in the hallway and looked around. Somewhere Kralik was watching her, and taunting her.</P>
<P>"Hide and seeeek..." He said, hidden.</P>
<P>She looked all around her.</P>
<P>"Hide and seek!"</P>
<P>The hall, the stairs and the adjacent room were empty. There she saw Kralik's crate. The crate door was closed and looked locked. She approached it, and it suddenly swung open. Kralik jumped out and grabbed her by the throat. Buffy gasped in fright.</P>
<P>"Why did you come to the dark of the woods?" He yanked her bag out of her hands and looked into it. Inside was a smaller bow, several stakes and a few knives. "To bring all these sweets to grandmother's house?"</P>
<P>He dropped the bag and pulled her closer. Buffy surprised him by holding up a cross. He leapt back from her in fear. She held it out at arm's length, shaking nervously. Kralik stared at her for awhile smiling evilly, then suddenly grabbed her arm and pulled it and the cross into his chest. He rubbed it around and laughed as it burnt his skin.</P>
<P>"Oh-oh, no, no. Just a little lower. Right...Oh, yes. Yes. Oh. Oooh! Thank you very much."</P>
<P>Buffy let go of the cross and ran. Kralik just smiled and watched her run. She ran into the kitchen and locked the door. Hobson's remains were still there. She noticed the body but didn't have time to look at it. She was distracted by Kralik pounding on the door. She ran to the counter and looked through the drawers trying to find anything she could use. She couldn’t find anything, and looked up when the pounding stopped. She looked around again, still couldn’t find anything. Slowly she stepped back to the door and quietly opened it.</P>
<P>The coast was clear, so she came into the hall. She made her way toward the stairs. Almost there, she made a dash for them and started to run up. Kralik punched his arm through the railing and tripped her, making her fall and cut her forehead against the steps. He grabbed her leg and pulled her down a bit. She struggled to get away. She grabbed a broken piece of the railing and stabbed at his arm with it. He let go and decided to run up the stairs after her. </P>
<P>Buffy scrambled to her feet, ran to the top and started down the hall. At a bend in the hall she stopped and looked around. The hallway was empty, so she ran to the first door. It was locked, so she went to the next. It opened, and she ran in, slamming the door behind her. The room was pitch black. She searched around until she found a string hanging from the ceiling. She pulled it and the light went on. She stared in shock at the walls around her. They were covered with Polaroid’s of her mother. </P>
<P>She grabbed one off the wall to make sure. Just then she heard Kralik pounding at the door. He punched through and reached in, searching for the knob to unlock it. She ran to another door, opened it and ran out into the hall. Just as she reached the end, Kralik stepped out in front of her.</P>
<P>"If you stray from the path, you will lose your way."</P>
<P>He reached out and put his hand on her cheek. She tried to push him away, but he was too strong and bent down toward her neck.</P>
<P>"I won't take it all. I won't take it all."</P>
<P>She strained hard to keep him at bay. Suddenly Kralik had one of his attacks. He grabbed his head and began to scream. Buffy tried to get past him, but he shoved her into the wall, stunning her. He pulled out his pill bottle and struggled to get it open. Buffy regained her bearings and grabbed the bottle out of his hands. She ran down the hall away from him.</P>
<P>"No! No! No!"</P>
<P>He had a hard time coming after her with the pain in his head. Buffy reached the far end of the hall and leapt into the laundry chute. Kralik looked down the chute and heard her sliding, but didn't follow. Instead he staggered back the other way.</P>
<P>Buffy came sliding out of the chute and onto a table. It broke beneath her, and she fell to the floor in a cloud of dust. Her mother was there, tied to a chair and gagged, and saw her daughter fall.</P>
<P>"Buffy?" She tried to say, but her voice was muffled.</P>
<P>Buffy got up and scrambled over to her mother. She tried to untie her, but couldn’t.</P>
<P>"Buffy, we have to get out..."</P>
<P>They heard pounding at the basement door. Buffy stopped struggling with the ropes, as Kralik smashed the door. He came running down the stairs demanding his pills.</P>
<P>"Where are they? Where are they?" He asked, near screaming.</P>
<P>He ran into the room, and Buffy faked trying to get past him and up the stairs. He grabbed her and shoved her against a wall. He saw the pill bottle in her hands and snatched it from her. He struggled with the lid as he stumbled over to where he saw a glass of water near the wine racks. He got the lid off, popped a couple of pills and gulped down the water. He gasped for air and took several deep breaths as he began to calm down, knowing that the medicine should soon take effect. He smiled evilly over at Buffy and took some forced steps in her direction. She just watched him come.</P>
<P>"You don't seem to understand your place in all of this. Do you have any idea..."</P>
<P>Suddenly he realized something was very wrong and stopped in his tracks.</P>
<P>"Oh, my! What have you…" He began to shake and looked back up at Buffy. "My pills!"</P>
<P>She pulled the now-empty bottle of Holy Water from her pocket and held it up for him to see. He dropped the glass and began to shake violently, grunting and groaning in pain.</P>
<P>"No. No..."</P>
<P>Smoke began to puff out of his clothes. Buffy watched coolly.</P>
<P>"If I was at full Slayer power, I'd be punning right about now."</P>
<P>"No! No!"</P>
<P>He screamed loudly, and then crumbled to ashes from the inside out. Buffy closed her eyes and let out a sigh of relief. She pocketed the bottle and rushed over to her mother. She pulled the gag from her mouth and began to work on the ropes again.</P>
<P>"Buffy, thank God you're okay. Oh, that man..."</P>
<P>"I can't get these. They're too tight."</P>
<P>"Can't you just..."</P>
<P>"Not right now.  Maybe there's some clippers around."</P>
<P>She stood up to look around, when suddenly Blair lunged at her. Giles was right behind him. Blair grabbed Giles and threw him against a shelf rack. Blair punched him in the face and in the gut. Giles doubled over, but thrust up with his arm, plunging a stake into Blair's chest. He burst into ashes. Slowly, Giles straightened up. He and Buffy looked at each other.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Back at the library, Buffy was sitting at the table, Giles was standing by his office door, and Quentin was talking to her.</P>
<P>"Congratulations, you passed. You exhibited extraordinary courage and clear-headedness in battle. The Council is very pleased."</P>
<P>"Do I get a gold star?" She deadpanned.</P>
<P>"I understand that you're upset..."</P>
<P>"You understand nothing. You set that monster loose, and he came after my mother."</P>
<P>"You think the test was unfair?"</P>
<P>"I think you better leave town before I get my strength back."</P>
<P>"We're not in the business of fair, Miss Summers, we're fighting a war."</P>
<P>"You're waging a war. She's fighting it. There is a difference." Giles said.</P>
<P>"Mr. Giles, if you don't mind..."</P>
<P>"The test is done. We're finished."</P>
<P>"Not quite. She passed. You didn't. The Slayer is not the only one who must perform in this situation. I've recommended to the Council, and they've agreed, that you be relieved of your duties as Watcher immediately. You're fired."</P>
<P>"On what grounds?"</P>
<P>"Your affection for your charge has rendered you incapable of clear and impartial judgment. You have a father's love for the child, and that is useless to the cause. It would be best if you had no further contact with the Slayer."</P>
<P>Buffy was pondering Quentin’s words.</P>
<P>"I'm not going anywhere."</P>
<P>"No, well, I didn't expect you would adhere to that. However, if you interfere with the new Watcher, or countermand his authority in any way, you will be dealt with. Are we clear?"</P>
<P>"Oh, we're very clear."</P>
<P>"Congratulations again." Quentin said to Buffy.</P>
<P>"Bite me."</P>
<P>"Yes, well, colorful girl."</P>
<P>Quentin left the library. Giles looked over at Buffy. She put her hand to her forehead. She sniffed, and reached for the cloth that was lying on the table next to a bowl of water, and picked it up. Giles walked over to her and put his hand on the cloth. She let him take it from her hand. </P>
<P>He dipped it in the water and knelt down in front of her, reached out and gently patted it on the gash in her forehead. She winced in pain, but didn't pull away. She looked up at him sadly for a moment, then lowered her eyes. Giles turned the now-bloody cloth over and continued to lightly dab it on her wound.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>The next day Oz, Xander, and Willow were gathered in Buffy’s kitchen. Joyce was there also.</P>
<P>"I can't believe Giles was fired. How could Giles get fired?" Willow said.</P>
<P>"So, how did you manage to kill Kralik?" Oz said.</P>
<P>"Oh, she was very clever." Joyce said. Buffy raised her eyebrows at her. "You go ahead and tell it, dear. You tell it better."</P>
<P>"Now, now when you say 'fired', do you mean 'fired'?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"You're not cruising past that concept any time soon, are you?" Xander said sarcastically.</P>
<P>"Well, it's just... I mean he's been fired! He's, he's unemployed! He's... between jobs."</P>
<P>"Giles isn't going anywhere, Will. He's still librarian." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Okay, but I'm writing an angry letter."</P>
<P>"You know, nothing's really gonna change. The important thing is that I kept up my special birthday tradition of gut-wrenching misery and horror."</P>
<P>"Bright side to everything." Oz said.</P>
<P>Buffy smiled as she remembered the previous night. The part before being almost killed by an insane vampire. The more she thought about it, the quicker her bad thoughts went away. She smiled at Willow, who smiled right back.</P>
<P>"You know, Oz? You’re absolutely right."</P>
<P>Oz grinned, and Xander, looking at Buffy and Willow, nearly fell.</P>
<P>"Oh my God…" Xander couldn’t form words. </P>
<P>"What’s wrong with him?" Joyce asked.</P>
<P>Buffy was speechless. "I…"</P>
<P>"That’s just the way he is. You get used to it." Willow said.</P>
<P>Buffy gave her a ‘thank you’ look.</P>
<P>"I’m gonna go to the Bronze for practice. Anybody wanna come?" Oz asked.</P>
<P>"Sure!" Buffy and Willow said together.</P>
<P>They left with Oz, leaving a stuttering Xander who had come to a sitting position on the kitchen floor.</P>
