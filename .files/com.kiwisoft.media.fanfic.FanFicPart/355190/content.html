<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Four-Way Intersection -->

<p>Lily found Sam where the whole thing started, the newspaper
office editing her latest article. At least this time the taller brunette
actually seemed to be getting some work done. Lily smiled to herself. It had
been two weeks since she'd started `seeing' Nicole in a romantic way and no one
knew yet. She was about to tell Sam and could only imagine what Sam's reaction
was going to be. She hoped Sam took it OK. </p>
<p>"Hey, Sam, got a sec?" she asked from the doorway. Sam looked
up, pencil firmly grasped in her teeth and nodded. </p>
<p>"Sure, Lil," she said, removing the pencil and motioning to a
seat. "What's up?" Lily sat down and found herself at a loss for words.
</p>
<p>"Ah, how are you and Brooke?" she asked instead. Sam looked at
her in confusion for a minute, knowing that wasn't what Lily wanted to talk
about to start with. She shrugged. </p>
<p>"Great, I guess," Sam answered. "It's tough, you know? We have
to be careful of the whole `popularity' thing and all. I mean, it means jack to
me but I know it means a lot to Brooke so the second we hit the front doors of
the school we have to revert to our roles. It's frustrating sometimes when I all
I want to do is reach out and kiss her." Lily nodded. She could relate. She and
Nicole had the same problem. There were some lines they just weren't ready to
cross just yet, that one being the most obvious. </p>
<p>As much as Nicole was enjoying `rocking the boat' and
genuinely cared for Lily, she was hesitant to sink the boat and drown them both.
And Lily wasn't going to push her so they continued with the parts that everyone
expected them to play inside of school. Outside of school was another matter
entirely. </p>
<p>Nicole was surprisingly romantic and thoughtful. She bought
Lily flowers and took her to nice places she thought Lily would like but that
weren't too ostentatious or over the top. She wanted Lily to feel comfortable
wherever they went, like they were equals and that was exactly how Lily felt.
She was oddly comfortable in Nicole's company but as much as she liked the
places they went, the times Lily enjoyed the most were when they were cuddled on
the couch together watching a movie and Nicole was running her fingers through
her hair, just holding her. For Lily, that was contentment. She never thought
she'd think of Nicole as a factor in that. </p>
<p>"I know," Lily agreed absently. Sam arched an eyebrow.
</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" she shot back in disbelief and with a
half-smirk. Lily sighed. </p>
<p>"Look, Sam, I really need to talk to you about something," she
started. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Oh geeze, last time we had this conversation we were both `outed'.
What's left?" she asked with dread. Lily bit the bullet. </p>
<p>"I'm seeing someone," she blurted out. Sam blinked and then
smiled. </p>
<p>"That's great, Lily. Who's the lucky girl?" Lily tried to
think of a delicate way of putting it given the animosity between Sam and Nicole
but couldn't find any. She looked at Sam with a pleading look on her face. </p>
<p>"Nicole," she said simply. Sam burst out laughing, confusing
Lily. "What? What's so funny?" she asked, slightly annoyed at the unexpected
reaction. Sam kept laughing, even pointing at Lily for a second, and eventually
degrading far enough to have to hold on to her sides as the laughter overtook
her. Lily glared. </p>
<p>"It's not funny, Sam," Lily snapped when tears started to roll
down Sam's face. She was getting pissed at Sam, very quickly. "What is so God
damn funny?" Sam collected herself and sniffed. </p>
<p>"I could have sworn you said `Nicole'," she giggled. "And
there's no WAY you're that desperate. I mean, Satan, really." Lily glared at her
more intently. </p>
<p>"I DID say Nicole, Sam. I am dating, seeing, romantically
involved with Nicole," she said evenly. Sam arched an eyebrow and stared at her
for a few seconds before flying up out of her chair. </p>
<p>"ARE YOU COMPLETELY INSANE?" she screamed. Lily winced at the
volume level. But it was the reaction she was waiting for. "We ARE talking about
the same Nicole Julian who enjoys making our lives an absolute living Hell,
correct?" </p>
<p>"Technically, yes," Lily conceeded. "But I've gotten to know
her better and she's nothing like the person she seems to be?" </p>
<p>"Person? She's not even human, Lily! What are you thinking?"
Sam asked incredulously. "And Nicole's gay?" she added as an afterthought. Lily
smiled at the last part. </p>
<p>"Yes, she's gay, Sam. I'm starting to wonder about the
planetary alignment around the time the four of us were born but, yeah. And as
far as what I was thinking?" </p>
<p>"You obviously weren't, Lily," Sam snapped. "Nicole Julian,"
she hissed, "is just plain evil." Lily stood up to look Sam in the eye as best
she could. </p>
<p>"No, she's not, Sam," Lily countered with as much venom. "You
don't know her?" </p>
<p>"I don't want to." </p>
<p>"Let me finish a damn sentence! You don't know her like I do.
She isn't who she appears to be. There's more to her than the bleached blonde,
bitch on wheels persona she presents, Sam. There is a genuine, caring and
compassionate human being under all those Gucci, Prada and arrogant trappings,"
Lily told her. </p>
<p>"Yeah, right," Sam snickered. Lily rolled her eyes.
</p>
<p>"You have no idea, Sam. You don't know what her childhood was
like," Lily said sadly. </p>
<p>"Aw, summers in the cape, more money than God, everything she
ever desired, no affection from Mummy and Daddy, yeah, I can imagine. The
hardship," Sam said sarcastically. </p>
<p>"You're being unfair, Sam," Lily accused. </p>
<p>"Like she's ever been fair to us, Lily. God, do you have any
idea what she's capable of?" </p>
<p>"Yes, we've both experienced Nic at her worst first hand,
Sam," Lily reminded her. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Than why? I don't understand this. Why willingly subject
yourself to her?" </p>
<p>"Because that Nicole and the real Nicole are two different
entities," Lily explained patiently. "And while she'll never be you, Sam, I can
never HAVE you. I accept that. I shouldn't have to be alone when there's someone
who cares for me and that I care for too." Sam was still stunned. </p>
<p>"True, but Nicole? That's a lot to take in, Lily," Sam
whispered as shock overcame outrage. Lily hugged her. </p>
<p>"She makes me happy, Sam. Isn't that all that matters?" Sam
nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, I guess. But guess this straight, if she hurts you she
answers to me," Sam warned. Lily smiled. </p>
<p>"Thank you." Sam still looked at her strangely. </p>
<p>"Nicole? Aw man," she sighed. Things in her universe suddenly
stopped making sense. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Wow, Nicole. Lily?" Brooke asked in shock after Nicole told
her about Lily. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah," she said shyly. She and Lily decided to tell both Sam
and Brooke. Brooke was taking it very well, aside from being shocked. Nicole
wondered how Lily was doing with Sam. Something told her Sam wasn't going to
take it so well. </p>
<p>(I kinda wish I could see the look on Spam's face) Nic
snickered to herself. Brooke sat on the plush couch in the Novac. </p>
<p>"When did you discover you were gay, Nic?" Brooke asked. Nic
sat down with her. It was a legitimate question. </p>
<p>"I think I always knew, Brooke. But in the interest of keeping
up with appearances and keeping my Mom off my back, I pretended to be straight,"
she explained. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"I understand," she said and Nicole knew she did. "Uhm, Nic,
there's something I need to tell you." Nicole waved her off. </p>
<p>"Brooke, I all ready know about you and Sam," Brooke stared at
her in shock. Nic was starting to worry about the effects of too much shock on
Brooke's system. </p>
<p>"Wha? How?" </p>
<p>"Lily didn't tell me, if that's what you're thinking. No, I
knew how Sam felt about you for a long time just by looking at her and seeing
how she looked at you. I may despise the girl but there's no mistaking the raw
love she has for you Brooke. I hope you know how much she loves you, it's
written across her face like one of her hideous headlines. Hell, I was surprised
it took you so long to figure it out." </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, apparently I can be obnoxiously oblivious to the
overwhelmingly obvious," Brooke joked. Nicole laughed. </p>
<p>"You said it, I didn't," Nic pointed out. "So you're OK with
this?" Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Be kinda hypocritical if I wasn't, don't you think? Besides,
if you're happy, that's all that matters. But Sam isn't going to take this well.
Lily means a lot to her and she hates you." Nic sighed. </p>
<p>"I know. But if she really cares for Lily she'll want Lily to
be happy. And I like to think I can make Lily happy," Nicole said. Brooke hugged
her. </p>
<p>"I'm glad you're happy Nic. You seem to really care for Lily.
It shows when you talk about her." Nicole blushed. </p>
<p>"That obvious, huh?" </p>
<p>"Yup," Brooke laughed. Before Nicole could say anymore, the
door to the Novac opened and in walked Sam and Lily. </p>
<p>"Sam." </p>
<p>"Brooke." </p>
<p>"Lily." </p>
<p>"Nicole." </p>
<p>"Spam." </p>
<p>"Satan." </p>
<p>"Nicole!" </p>
<p>"Sam!" </p>
<p>"Lily?" </p>
<p>"Brooke?" </p>
<p>"OK, hold it!" Brooke yelled throwing her hands in the air.
The three other girls stared at her. "Can we please stop with the Mickey Mouse
Club roll call? I'm getting dizzy and a headache. Plus I think we all know who
all the players here are." </p>
<p>"Actually, it reminded me more of The Rocky Horror Picture
Show but, OK, you have a point," Sam agreed. She still glared at Nicole though. </p>
<p>"Well, this is an awkward moment," Lily sighed as she sat down
next to Nicole. </p>
<p>"Four lesbians in a high school bathroom. There's a joke in
here somewhere," Sam muttered. Brooke glared at her. "What? I said there was a
joke in there somewhere, not that I was going to go hunting for it." </p>
<p>"So," Brooke started. The word hung there in the air like a
sour note. </p>
<p>"Oh boy," Sam groaned as she hopped up on the sink and
resisted the urge to laugh at the absurdity of the situation. </p>
<p>"Why is everyone suddenly so tense?" Nicole asked bluntly.
"OK, it's like this. Sam, you love Brooke and Brooke loves you. Yipee for you. I
love Lily and she cares for me even if she does carry a torch for you. Bully for
us. You and I dislike each other, Sam, but we'll agree on one thing: if you hurt
Brooke, I'll hurt you and if I hurt Lily, you'll hurt me. Am I right?"
</p>
<p>"You'd better believe it," Sam said from the sink. Nicole
nodded. </p>
<p>"See? That wasn't that hard, now was it?" Nicole asked as she
wrapped her arms around Lily. Brooke walked over to Sam. </p>
<p>"One thing else is for sure," Brooke said as she joined Sam on
the sink. </p>
<p>"What?" Lily asked. </p>
<p>"There won't be any shortages of dull moments," Brooke joked
as Sam leaned her head on her shoulder. Everyone laughed. </p>
<p>"And if this ever gets out, the male population is going to be
crushed," Nicole added. "Let's face it, even Spam with her puppy dog looks is
cute and the rest of us are gorgeous. The guys are going to flip that we're all
off the market." Sam glared. </p>
<p>"First off, her name is Sam and second, she does not look like
a puppy dog," Brooke countered slightly peeved. Sam stuck out her tongue at
Nicole. "She's beautiful." Nicole sighed. </p>
<p>"Whatever," she said. There was really no point in arguing
with someone as far gone as Brooke was. </p>
<p>"But for now this stays between the four of us, right?" Lily
asked, knowing that it wasn't a bridge any of them wanted to cross just yet.
Three other heads, two blonde and one brunette nodded at her. </p>
<p>"When the time is right, if ever, we'll say something," Sam
said simply. </p>
<p>"Until then, I'm going to take my girl out for something to
eat," Nicole said, standing up and taking Lily with her. </p>
<p>"You guys wanna come?" Lily asked. Nicole groaned and Lily
elbowed her in the ribs. "Come on, Nic, it won't kill you." </p>
<p>"OK, fine," Nicole agreed reluctantly. Sam snickered and
Brooke elbowed her in the ribs. </p>
<p>"Knock it off, McPherson," Brooke chided. Sam looked at her
innocently. </p>
<p>"I didn't do anything. Besides, that was funny," she said with
a smirk. She leaned over to whisper in Brooke's ear. "Lily's got her wrapped
around her little finger. Come on, admit it, it's funny." The answering grin on
Brooke's face was admission enough. </p>
<p>"Are you two lovebirds coming or not?" Nicole asked
impatiently. Brooke and Sam jumped down from the sink. </p>
<p>"Yeah, let's go," Brooke said, taking Sam's hand. Sam looked
at her; they were, after all still at school. Brooke grinned at her cheekily.
"What? We can hide behind the `stepsister' thing." </p>
<p>"That's only going to work for so long," Sam pointed out
playfully. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Until then," she said. "I plan to use it." </p>
