<p>There's all kinds of voices circulating in the air. They make
	little sense. They are just one big bundle of noise. Then slowly they
	start to meld together and form like this one single humming sound.
	It keeps getting louder and louder until I think I can't take it
	anymore. And then all of a sudden everything goes quiet. Just like
	that.</p>
	<p>And then I hear her voice. Everything else has stepped aside cause
	she's talking. And she's the most important thing in this
	world, "I didn't do anything mom!", her voice is as
	beautiful as ever. Even in it's agitated state it rings clear.
	Pierces through everything, "It's like I've always said.
	There's something very wrong with her up here. You should've
	heard what she said right before passing out!"</p>
	<p>The voice subsides, and is replaced by another one. This one is
	closer but still farther away, it is not as pure, or as demanding as
	the first one. As her voice, "Like what?", there's a few
	grumbling sounds as she tries to say something. But when she
	doesn't, the weaker voice goes on, "Sam... you didn't
	slap her, did you?"</p>
	<p>"MOM!", the shriek almost sends me back to spiraling in the
	weird mix of sounds, but her voice grabs a hold of me and doesn't
	let me fall, "Sheez! What the hell do you think of me?"</p>
	<p>"Well, I'm sorry. But you and Brooke fight a lot. And she has
	been quite difficult in the past few days."</p>
	<p>"I would. Never. Hit her", she says. And in my dream I smile.
	The way she says it, makes it seem like she could hit someone else,
	but not me. Like I'm in some ways more special to her. Of course
	it's only my mind making assumptions it's not entitled to
	make.</p>
	<p>"So what do we do with her?"</p>
	<p>"I don't know. You're the parent", there's a sigh
	and it's not hers. But the way I hear it so clearly, let's me
	know I'm waking up. I'm almost ready to open my eyes,
	"Well, fine. Let's try this then.."</p>
	<p>"Sam..", the weak voice says. Then something cold and wet
	splashes across my face, "Don't..", I gasp for air in a
	massive panic attack as my mind thinks it's drowning. At the same
	time my body instinctually bounces up into sitting position, and my
	eyes shoot open.</p>
	<p>"Hey! It worked!", she's standing in front of me with a
	smug smile on her face, and an empty glass on her hand, "Who
	would've guessed?"</p>
	<p>I lift my hand and try to wipe my face dry and still keep my eyes on
	her, "Are you okay Brooke?", Jane asks from beside her.</p>
	<p>I attempt to nod in response but fail miserably. I only manage to
	amuse her, "Hello?", she says waving a hand and grinning,
	"Anyone there?"</p>
	<p>I could so kill her right now! Oh, how could I ever be so stupid as
	to think she'd ever love me! She's just mocking me and
	I'll probably get to read all about my crush on tomorrow's
	paper at school, "Yeah I'm here", my rage shocks some
	sense back into me, "As much as I'm ever here. You know, cause
	there's something very wrong with me up here", I glare at her
	and tap my head with a finger.</p>
	<p>Sam's a little taken a back, "You were conscious?", she
	finally asks sounding appalled, "You were just playing a joke on
	us?"</p>
	<p>"No. I don't know what I was", but I know you have no
	right to get angry, you bitch!, "Could you please leave me
	alone?"</p>
	<p>"Are you sure you're okay?", Jane sounds genuine enough.</p>
	<p>This time I'm able to nod. Sam opens her mouth and tries to say
	something, "Please Sam?", I cut in.</p>
	<p>"Come on Sam. Brooke needs to rest", Jane says and grabs her
	daughter's hand. Sam reluctantly follows her out and Jane closes
	the door behind them.</p>
	<p>Good God. I throw myself back down on the bed. I had no idea it would
	go this badly. I thought... I thought she would at least be nice...
	Instead she only mocks me. And laughs at me. Probably right now.
	Behind my back. But I don't care. I don't... I won't cry.
	She doesn't deserve my tears.</p>
	<p>"Brooke?", there's a knock on the bathroom door. And
	it's Sam. She must've just circled around there, cause she
	hasn't been gone a minute yet.</p>
	<p>"Go away Sam", I try to keep my voice even, but it falters.
	And I want to cry. Cause just hearing her voice feels so good.</p>
	<p>She opens the door and comes in, "Brooke.. we need to talk",
	she says and I hear her steps as she walks closer. I don't look
	at her. I'm lying face towards the wall on the bed and refuse to
	look at her.</p>
	<p>"No we don't", I answer her, "You said enough
	already."</p>
	<p>The bed shifts slightly as she sits down at the foot end, "Yeah,
	but you didn't", her voice is so tender this time. It's
	nothing like when I woke up. Nothing, "What did you mean?"</p>
	<p>"What? You didn't get me on tape the first time?"</p>
	<p>"Brooke, please don't be like that."</p>
	<p>I fling up and start screaming, "Me?! You threw WATER on my
	face!", she jerks back from the shear ferocity of my voice,
	"And you called me insane! And a liar and God knows what
	else!", I pour out my emotions and the tears take advantage of
	the situation. They start to dribble down when I'm not paying
	attention, "And all that right after... right after...", the
	words get stuck in my throat. I lie back down and I start to sob.</p>
	<p>A minute goes by. I want her to leave. She doesn't. I want her to
	stay. She puts her hand on my leg. I want her to love me. And she
	starts to talk, "Brooke", she says and I love her voice,
	"I'm sorry. I thought... I thought...", she doesn't
	finish. She sounds so sad, I have to look. I twist my neck and I look
	at her. The tears have stopped and I see almost clearly, "I
	thought you were... making fun of me."</p>
	<p>What? I would never, "What?", my voice is barely a whimper.</p>
	<p>She nods a little and smiles. It's the smile I love the most.
	It's happy, but it's a little uncertain. It's rare that
	she is unsure about anything, "Yeah it sounds silly now. But I
	thought you had...", she bows her head and tries to find the
	words. I sit up cause I know what's coming, "I love you too
	Brooke. And I thought you had found out... and were just making fun of
	it."</p>
	<p>Oh, I would never make fun of you! I love you Sam! I throw my arms
	around her back and pull her into a hug, "I would never", oh
	joy of joys! She does love me!, "How could you think I'd be so
	cruel?"</p>
	<p>"How could you?", she whispers back. And I feel how her hands
	tentatively raise up my back. She barely touches me, but it's
	enough. I don't answer, because she doesn't expect an answer.
	Love is funny. It makes you so vulnerable. We both know it now. We
	both know we could tear each other apart with only a few words,
	"The water was just to revive you by the way", she whispers
	after a time. Her hold is firmer now. She's hugging me back and
	not just lying in my arms, "And I love the way you're a little
	slow up there. In your pretty head."</p>
	<p>I press my head against her hair, and I smile, "I'm not.
	Slow."</p>
	<p>"Oh, of course you aren't", she says and one of her hands
	sneaks upwards, she's caressing my neck, "Little Brookie is a
	clever girl", she talks in slow and clear words, pronouncing them
	just right, like I was a baby.</p>
	<p>I start to giggle, "Seriously, Sam. Stop it", I say and pull
	away from the hug.</p>
	<p>She pushes her forehead against mine, "Make me", she says
	with a husky voice. Her lips linger less than an inch from mine, but
	she refuses to kiss me. Refuses to make the last move, "Kiss
	me."</p>
	<p>"I don't think I can", I say grinning evilly, "My
	slow brain needs a little time to process all this. Get back to me in
	a week or so."</p>
	<p>She pulls away a little and starts grinning herself, "Oh!",
	she chuckles, "You think you can hold out a week? Please...
	I've seen the way you lust after me."</p>
	<p>I tilt my head and replace the grin with a smug smile, "Well, I
	know I could hold out longer than you."</p>
	<p>"Ab.. Ts..", she stutters and looks at me for the longest
	time with her mouth open.</p>
	<p>"Yeah, and I'm the one who's slow..."</p>
	<p>"Oh!", she screams and jumps into motion. She pushes me down
	on my back and pins my hands down on the bed, "Take that
	back."</p>
	<p>"What?", I still keep smiling the smug smile, making her even
	more furious.</p>
	<p>"You can either be the smart one, or the pretty one", she
	says, "Take your pick."</p>
	<p>It's so adorable how she is so serious about it, "You can be
	both", I finally say and soften my smile a touch, "I'll
	be.. the famous one?"</p>
	<p>She releases her hold and lies down next to me, "No", she
	says and agrees to smile again, "I want that too."</p>
	<p>"Aww!", I grumble, "Well, what am I then?"</p>
	<p>"You can be the girl who sings for her supper."</p>
	<p>"So that would make you the monk whose forehead is high?", I
	say completing the verse.</p>
	<p>And she is surprised that I knew it. But of course she tries to hide
	her astonishment, "Are you saying my forehead is too big?"</p>
	<p>"No", I answer and lean forward. I place a light kiss above
	her eyes, "It's just perfect."</p>
	<p>"Then what are you saying?"</p>
	<p>"I'm saying I love you", I answer, not smiling. Cause I
	want her to know how much I mean it. Slowly I lift my hand and place
	it on her cheek.</p>
	<p>We look into each others eyes the longest time. She's not smiling
	either. And I find that she's even more beautiful when she
	doesn't smile. Or when she doesn't hide behind her mask.
	She's the most beautiful when she just is, "But you still
	won't kiss me?"</p>
	<p>"And give you the satisfaction of beating me? No way!", I
	start to laugh.</p>
	<p>"You know Brooke", she says trying to sound hurt, "When
	you love someone, you're supposed to be nice to them. And let
	them win from time to time."</p>
	<p>She looks so serious, for a second I almost give in, but then I just
	burst into a bigger laugh, "Yeah right! You almost had me going
	though."</p>
	<p>And she's laughing too. Her head twitches closer unintentionally
	and our noses brush against each other. And then before I know it
	we've stopped laughing and we're kissing. And it's so
	passionate at first. So intense, so hungry. Like I have dreamed it
	many times. But when it goes on for longer it becomes more tender.
	More affectionate. It's not just lust anymore, it's more.
	It's love. I roll myself on top of her and bury my hand into her
	hair. We break for a second and she smiles again. She tries to throw
	in some cute comment, but before she has time I'm kissing her
	again.</p>
	<p>And then just as I'm pushing my tongue into her mouth the door
	flies open. We both turn to look at the distraction, "Brooke,
	have you seen Sam?", Jane asks and then sees the both of us.</p>
	<p>Her mouth is hanging on the floor, "Uh... yeah", I stutter
	out. And it's too much. Sam's love, the kiss, Jane, all of it
	is too much. The world starts to spin again. Huh boy, here I go again.</p>
