<!-- Live A Little \ Part 2 -->

<p>Alt Sam yawns loudly as she sits besides Sam who is using her free period at school to work on her article for the newspaper.</p>

<p>"Thanks for reminding me what a boring life I used to lead."</p>

<p>"Hey, I didn't ask you to leave Heaven! Blame yourself."</p>

<p>"Are you nearly done?"</p>

<p>"If you would shut your mouth for just one minute, I would have finished this ages ago." Sam finishes typing the last few lines. "There, done."</p>

<p>"For all my bitching, I must offer my congratulations. That's a great article."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>She stands up and realizes that everybody has been staring at her the entire time. She glares at Alt Sam, before she offers a sheepish look towards the rest of the class.</p>

<p>"I like talking to myself sometimes."</p>

<p>Alt Sam laughs. "If only they knew!"</p>

<p>"Shut up!"</p>

<p>She offers one last smile before she runs out of the class room.</p>

<p>"You're making me look demented."</p>

<p>"You don't need my help with that, Sam. What do we have next?"</p>

<p>"Bio."</p>

<p>"Oh no!"</p>

<p>"Look at it this way, you get to stare at Brooke the entire time."</p>

<p>"Lead the way, Oh living One!"</p>

<p>Sam takes her seat while Alt Sam leaps onto the bench.</p>

<p>"There was one advantage to being dead."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"No more staring at Bio Glass."</p>

<p>They share a laugh, Sam quieting down as the rest of the class files in.</p>

<p>"Can you try and stay quiet, please? Just this once."</p>

<p>"I've been on my best behaviour the entire time I've been with you."</p>

<p>"I don't need your extra commentary while I'm in class. It distracts me!"</p>

<p>"It's not my fault you laugh."</p>

<p>"The teachers are beginning to wonder if I'm insane! You've been with me less than a day and you've caused me nothing but trouble!"</p>

<p>Alt Sam grins as Brooke walks through the door. "Brooke's here!"</p>

<p>"Behave!"</p>

<p>"Hi Sam."</p>

<p>"Hi Brooke" Both Sams reply. Sam shoots her double a look. They look up as Bio Glass walks in, her customary scowl a permanent fixture on her face.</p>

<p>"Now that's one thing that hasn't changed. Bio Glass, charming as ever."</p>

<p>Sam snickers.</p>

<p>"What's so funny Sam?" Brooke whispers.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Oi! McMorons! Enough chatter." Bio Glass turns to the blackboard and begins writing, while Alt Sam takes the opportunity to lie down on the bench, staring dreamily up at Brooke.</p>

<p>Sam glares. "Would you sit properly please?"</p>

<p>"You're just jealous."</p>

<p>"Your legs are covering my notebook! I can't see"</p>

<p>"It's always whinge whinge whinge with you, isn't it Sam?"</p>

<p>Brooke and the rest of the class watch on perplexed, as Sam continues whispering to the bench. Bio Glass interrupts the one sided conversation.</p>

<p>"McPherson? Or should that be McMental? What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing ma'am, sir."</p>

<p>"Then stop talking to the air."</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am, sir."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Sam walks by the cafeteria with Alt Sam in tow.</p>

<p>"Ah, the cafeteria."</p>

<p>"You sound like you actually miss the place."</p>

<p>"I do, though the food is another story. I always thought if anything would kill me, it'll be that."</p>

<p>"I don't know how you do it."</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Handle death so well."</p>

<p>"I'm used to it."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it hurt? Knowing all the things you'll be missing out on?"</p>

<p>"Of course it does! But shit happens! Maybe I didn't get the chance to live, but you can! It's why I'm here, following your stubborn ass!"</p>

<p>Sam enters the Novak, relieved it's empty. She still had trouble remembering that only she could see her twin which meant everybody had been shooting her weird looks all day. She turns toward the cause of her problems. </p>

<p>"I was doing fine without you."</p>

<p>"You were, were you? Tell me Sam, are you living?"</p>

<p>"What kind of question is that?"</p>

<p>"If I told you that you had ten seconds to live, how long a list would your regrets be? Exactly. You're not living. No one in this damn school is." She paused sadly. "Everybody hides! It's okay to be an individual just as long as everybody else is! We don't take risks and we don't do the things we want to just because somebody else might take exception to it! People don't live for themselves, they live according to how others think they should!" She turned to Sam. "I learnt it the hard way and I'm not going to stand by and watch you make the same mistake. Live a little!" </p>

<p>"And me telling Brooke how I feel is supposed to change that?"</p>

<p>"It's a start! Don't you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, but I don't want to get hurt!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't have to be about you!"</p>

<p>"What the hell is that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p>"I gave up my life to save her and I'd do it again without a second thought." </p>

<p>"What's your point?"</p>

<p>"Offering your heart to someone is one of the most courageous things you could ever do. What's even more selfless is offering it without any strings attached."</p>

<p>"I don't think I can do that."</p>

<p>"Most people can't which is why most people don't."</p>

<p>"In other words, you want me to tell Brooke that I love her."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Even if it means she might not feel the same way, or she might laugh in my face."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's insane."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"So what's the point?"</p>

<p>"I can imagine that if you decide to tell her, your heart would start thumping, your palms will be sweaty, your stomach will be churning and you'll probably feel like throwing up."</p>

<p>"And that's a good thing?"</p>

<p>"That's how you know you're living Sam."</p>
