<!-- More Than Words \ Epilogue -->

<P>Claire pushed away from the tree she was leaning against
when she saw the light go out in room 214. She smiled, she knew that they'd be
busy for quite some time. It had taken her long enough, they'd better well enjoy
the benefits of her hard work! It was alright though, she was happy to do it as
she and many, many others would benefit from the two of them coming together.
Not to mention the fact that they made a cute couple. </P>
<P>Heading down the pathway that lead off of campus Claire
smiled to herself again, and then disappeared into a cloud of smoke. </P>
<P>Now, things were about to get interesting.</P>
