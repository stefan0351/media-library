<!-- The Scientific Method \ Chapter 1  - Observation -->

<p>B'Elanna could feel the headache coming on. Human aggravation combining with Klingon aggression to collect along her forehead's ridges and pool in her temples. The warp core diagnostic was not going anywhere until she was able to track down the problem, and while she could have sent one of her crew in to the Jefferies tubes B'Elanna was not that kind of crew chief. She would never order one of her people to do something she wouldn't be willing to do herself, and modesty aside she knew that she would be able to find, and fix what ever is wrong faster then anyone else.</p>

		<p>Except for her, Seven of Nine, or as B'Elanna thought of her, Princess Annika. Even when she was in the Collective she was part of Unimatrix 01 and things had not changed much here on Voyager. The captain's darling, she even had a crown. Implanted above her brow, she would arch it to let you know that she was willing to tolerate your, frail, imperfection for the moment. That was part of what made her so attractive to the Klingon. That challenge, that aloof, arrogance, even that unofficial status made her all the more desirable to the Klingon, wanting to claim Princess Annika, make the Princess her own.</p>

		<p>The fact she seemed to go out of her way to aggravate the engineer had the Klingon wanting her all the more. If she weren't so, damn, beautiful! Even now that sculpted body sitting on the floor of the Jefferies tube, those impossibly long legs tucked up underneath her made B'Elanna gasp as the opening hatch revealed the sight. She realized her gasp was a mistake as the scent hit her brain. Originally it was one of the reasons she could not stand the former drone. While her eyes saw a person her nose smelled a machine and the conflict always made her uneasy, but now it was different.</p>

		<p>As Seven's implants were removed, and her humanity reasserted itself, so did her scent. Now she smelled like a healthy, human woman. The scent of metal now faint, distant, like a perfume or a musk. A musk that she realized intrigued the engineer within her. The smell of machinery had always intrigued B'Elanna, made her want to learn and explore, to uncover that machines secrets. Now she found she wanted to discover the secrets of Seven of Nine. The human inside her finding she respected the former drone, Seven's skills second only to her own, and her emotional control something B'Elanna sorely missed.</p>

		<p>All those parts wondering, wanting to slide herself around the brown-sheathed body now sitting in front of the Jefferies tube panel. She wondered, would Seven pull away, turn her head to question her silently with that arched brow? Or would Seven relax into her embrace, let herself lean back into B'Elanna's arms? Turning her head, and craning that elegant neck to offer her parted lips in a silent request for B'Elanna's kiss.</p>

		<p>Seven could feel the heat as the hatch opened. The logical part of her mind reminded her that the Collective had never enhanced her tactile sense in such a manner, but she felt it none the less. Every time the diminutive engineer entered the room, her unique physiology throwing off warmth as much as her unique psychology threw off passion. The woman's presence seeming to fill whatever room she was in, and filling the former drone as well. Seven had analyzed the phenomenon early on, and learned that woman's passion seemed to grow in an exponential manner according to her aggravation.</p>

		<p>While she never went out of her way to aggravate the engineer she found herself pleased she seemed to inspire such emotion in such an interesting individual. Yet she also found herself feeling a sense of guilt. Her actions had caused her new Collective difficulty, and more had caused B'Elanna difficulty. The conflicting emotions confused her, while she would never deliberately cause the Lieutenant harm she still could not deny the fascination she found watching the woman's emotions. From the light in her eyes, to emotion rich tones of her voice, to watching the muscles moving under the yellow band of operations after she had moved to allow Torres to access the panel she was working on.</p>

		<p>Anger mixed with arousal fueled the lecture, but even as B'Elanna raged she couldn't help but feel admiration. The way she had just decided what she wanted and went for it reminded B'Elanna of herself. Seven's description of her troubles fitting in reminded B'Elanna of herself as well, and while she had to admit part of her reasons for comforting Seven came from her attraction, and not wanting to see Seven in pain. The largest part was that she felt a kinship with the former drone. Stranded between worlds, hiding in her work, opposites may attract, and likes repel, but there is something to be said for kindred spirits. She wanted Seven to know that she knew what she was going through, that she was not alone.</p>

		<p>She told her that she had been there, that Janeway had lectured her as much as she was lecturing her now. When she turned to look at Seven she found herself slipping, slipping into those eyes, nearly loosing her grip when Seven apologized for the inconvenience. As Seven left she bit down on that instinct to follow, and reminded herself it was Tom Paris she loved. That sweet, irrepressible goofball with the sandy blonde hair, and not the closest the Collective has come to the perfection it seeks.</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine was confused by the warmth that she was feeling; her normal interaction with B'Elanna Torres was much more aggressive, adversarial. The words of comfort and assurance had caused a whole new set of feelings to analyze. While she knew the sensations were of a mental nature she found she was having a physical response. She felt as if her body mass had been reduced, as if her feet were centimeters above the deck, and her cheeks and forehead felt warm enough to heat the metal of her implants.</p>

		<p>While her features seemed to be her normal impassive expression her reflection showed the heat in her face was an actual physical response, a light pink tint to her normally fair flesh. She also found her pupils had dilated with her arousal, while her eyes were wide with wonder. Putting her fully human hand to her face she found the warmth was physically manifest. While her Borg conditioning was telling her these feelings were irrelevant, her humanity was aching for more of them. She concluded that before any determination could be made she would need to conduct further research. Turning to her alcove's console she began to key in parameters.</p>

		<p>Torres was slightly alarmed as she heard the transporter beam. She had already repaired Seven's modifications, and even if they were a pain to fix, she couldn't help but notice they were quality work. While one hand was poised over her commbadge she relaxed as soon as she saw a familiar hand holding flowers peeking from the platform above her. She was annoyed with Tom Paris, the fact he had the flowers let her know he was ready for it. B'Elanna felt her anger spike as she thought about how he didn't even bother to hail her when his shift got extended. It was an easy matter to ask the computer his location, but the fact he couldn't take 5 seconds to let her know he would not be able to make it mixed hurt with her anger. Still there was something about the helmsman, as soon as she laid eyes on him the hurt seemed to recede, or perhaps her aggression/attraction/ arousal increased.</p>

		<p>Seven was already on her way to sickbay when the call from the captain arrived, B'Elanna was not in the science lab, and there was no relevant information to be found there either. She was unsure why her feelings had become so much more insistent, but as soon as she heard that Lt. Torres was injured she had wished to verify her condition with her own eyes. Yet, as she saw the condition of Lt. Torres she could feel her Borg conditioning slamming into place. Even as she felt her heart start to pound and worry seem to grip her forebrain she felt her heart rate recede and her mind switch from worry to analysis. Worry was irrelevant; B'Elanna Torres was essential to Seven of Nine's development, and therefore must be repaired. All of her faculties, her knowledge, every function of her implants focused on that goal.</p>

		<p>Seven of Nine was amazed, until this point her emotions were unwanted, unwelcome, intruders to her logical thought processes. Yet now as they seemed freed they seem melded to her Borg thought processes. This is what the Collective sought, the perfection in the unity of man and machine, emotion and logic. Her humanity providing a seemingly limitless source of energy that her logical thought processes were able to direct to her goal. When she thought of her goal she wondered, was this what Lt. Torres felt? It was an amazing sensation and she felt a connection to the human/klingon hybrid that she had not felt since being severed from the Collective.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>B'Elanna could feel her heart beating as Tom opened the wine and poured her a glass. Yet she could see the he was just as unsettled as she was. Voyager had managed to salvage some parts of the alien ship that had blown up in the binary pulsar when the aliens were trying to flee the ship, and the records about the command staff were one of the best protected files they could find. What they found had shaken the engineer. The alien scientists were studying the connection between aggression and arousal and had decided that her Klingon nature had made her an excellent test subject. They then proceeded to find someone she had aggressive feelings towards, and attempted to modify those feelings through moderating of the aggressive tendencies and amplification of other responses like arousal.</p>

		<p>They had learned that Tom was chosen because of his active sex drive, and his personality that is both ingratiating and annoying. They both looked a little scared as they started to speak, because they already felt the feelings they shared start to dwindle as the alien's influence was removed. They both were afraid of hurting the other but they knew lies would only compound what was already a difficult situation.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Seven of Nine felt small, diminished, even worse then when she was severed from the Collective. At that time her strength was in numbers, through her reliance upon others. Yet now she had found her own power, her own strength, but now it was gone. The aliens experiment in emotional suppression and ways to treat the defect combining with her Borg enhancements to give Seven a clarity the aliens did not expect, or even fully realize.</p>

		<p>A dark part of her wished that the alien species could find the clarity of the Collective themselves. Which was immediately followed by a sense of guilt for wishing assimilation upon anyone. She felt what was left of her mental reserves dwindle as her emotions sank back into conflict. Solemnly she set her alcove's controls and gratefully sank into the closest thing she had to sleep. Which caused her now unconscious form to not see another enter cargo bay 2 and stare at her with eyes filled with confusion, and perhaps a bit of wonder.</p>
