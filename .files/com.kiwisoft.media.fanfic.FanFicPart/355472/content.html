<!-- In the Bedroom \ Part Two -->

<p>"So are you like really into the solar system or something?" Katie
asked with a grin playing with the models of the planet's that were
hanging from a mural in Jessie's room.</p>

<p>"I feel like I haven't lived in this room forever," Jessie responded
contemplatively.  She hadn't been over since her mother's since the
accident, and even though it really hadn't been all that long ago, if
seemed as if it was.  Like it had been a lifetime ago, but then again
maybe it had been, a lifetime when she had still believed that her
parents were invincible.  She knew better now.</p>

<p>"Well, which room do you like better?" Katie asked playing with the
wrapper of a candy though she was more interested in watching Jessie
than opening the sugary treat.  "This room, or the one at your other
house?"</p>

<p>"This one's nicer," Jessie responded her gaze shifting to and away
from Katie, suddenly feeling self conscious for some reason.  "But I
kinda like the other one cause it's in the attic and away from
everything," she continued, her eyes now glued on the other girl as
her hands reached down to grab the helm of her sweater.</p>

<p>"Like a loft or something," Katie responded.  Her words coming out
charmingly blurry as she sucked on the candy that she had somehow
managed to open.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie responded as her eyes traveled up the length of
Katie's torso, lingering on the expanse of smooth skin that was
exposed as the tank top the girl was wearing rode up as she removed
her sweater.  Smiling ruefully to herself and dropping her gaze back
down to the comforter of her bed, Jessie waited for Katie to continue
speaking.  </p>

<p>"That's what I want, a big loft.in London," Katie continued dropping
her sweater onto the floor carelessly as she lowered herself onto
Jessie's bed.  </p>

<p>"I'm going to live on a ranch," Jessie declared somewhat dreamily as
she settled down on the bed, her eyes drifting back up to Katie.</p>

<p>"I could see that.  I could see you living like that," Katie
responded gently, her eyes locked on Jessie's face.  "On a ranch with
horses," she continued sliding down into a reclined position, laying
her head down so that she was facing Jessie. "Of course we wouldn't
see each other," she continued, not breaking the eye contact between
them for a moment.  "Me in London and you on a Ranch somewhere," she
finished in a melancholy tone that belayed the soft smile that graced
her delicate features. </p>

<p>"You could visit," Jessie breathed out softly, her lips curving up
into a tender smile as she let herself get caught up in Katie's
stare.  She began to feel that now familiar warmth spread across her
body, as they lay there.  She could feel her heart begin to beat
faster, pumping so loudly in fact that she was surprised Katie
couldn't hear it, and she became strangely aware of a tingling all
over her body.  These feelings that she had begun to have were new,
in general, which is to say that she had never felt them before that
day that Katie had flounced up to her in the hallway.  But since
then, as the two of them got closer, the more time they spent with
each other, the more she became aware of these strange things that
were happening inside of her.  It was like whenever they were around
each other someone was lighting a fire inside of her.  It kind of
scared her but more than that it called to her.  It was like the more
intense the feelings got; the more she wanted to feel them.</p>

<p>"So can you," Katie breathed out softly, revealing in Jessie's
presence so close to her own.  The girl's eyes were drawing her in,
warming her from the inside out.  She was captivated, as always.
There was something so amazingly precious about Jessie, something
vulnerable and beautiful about her that drew Katie towards her
helplessly, gratefully.  Her eyes, so deep and mysterious, the first
things Katie had noticed about her that day in the hallway as she had
listened to Tad blather on about nothing.  Tad hadn't understood
Jessie, hadn't wanted to, but she did, she wanted to know this girl
so badly she could taste it.  She wanted to look beyond the mystery
and the pain; she wanted to know the girl.</p>

<p>Jessie felt something shift in the air as they lay there together.
It was something intangible, metaphysical really because they hadn't
moved, they hadn't even blinked; yet she had felt something change.
The room around her seemed to disappear and all that she was aware of
were the beautiful green eyes gazing so intently at her, the light
bringing out the speckles of gold in them, making them twinkle.  She
felt as if she could feel the heat from the other girl's body
enveloping her, wrapping itself around her like blanket, reaching
inside of her and stroking her heart.  It was like she was standing
at the edge of a great precipice looking down into the dark,
wondering what lay there, and how it would feel to jump.</p>

<p>"Jessie?"</p>

<p>The voice shocked Jessie out of her trance her eyes widening in
surprise mixed in with a healthy dose of panic.  Quickly turning
around she saw Lily standing in her doorway, gazing at her.</p>

<p>"Lily?  Wha.what are you doing here?" she asked settling into a
sitting position in the bed trying to calm her suddenly frazzled
nerves.  </p>

<p>"You're Dad asked me to pick up a few things for you Mom," Lily
responded her eyes momentarily drifting to the lounging figure on the
bed behind Jessie before returning to her stepdaughter.  It was `I
think I'll come over to visit obscenely early in the morning' girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, I could've done that," Jessie responded, Lily's backwards glance
to Katie making her extremely nervous for some reason.  She couldn't
figure out why she was so jumpy all of a sudden, after all it wasn't
like she had done anything, they were just lying there minding their
own business, there was no reason for her to be alarmed.</p>

<p>"We assumed you were in school," Lily responded looking pointedly at
Jessie.  "Is there any reason you're not in school?" she continued.</p>

<p>Jessie's face dropped.  School.  Right.</p>
