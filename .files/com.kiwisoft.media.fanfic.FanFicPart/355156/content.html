<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Five -->

<p>Jane waited until Mike was settled in for the night before she even considered talking to him about what she knew about Sam and Brooke. The fact that she now had confirmation that there was indeed a 'relationship' going on between her daughter and stepdaughter, Jane was at a loss. She knew that she couldn't say that they had to put a stop to what was going on, that wouldn't be fair. But she was worried about how it would look to others and how Mike was going to take it.</p>
<p>"Mike, honey, I need to talk to you," she started hesitantly as Mike slid into bed. Mike picked up his head and looked at her.</p>
<p>"What about, dear?" he said softly. Jane bit her lip and searched for the right words.</p>
<p>"Well, have you noticed how?close, Brooke and Sam have become since the accident?" she asked carefully. Mike thought a minute and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's kind of hard NOT to notice, actually. They're pretty much living in each other's back pockets right now. I think it's good for them, especially Brooke to have something, someone so stable in her life right now," Mike explained.</p>
<p>"True," Jane agreed. She eyed Mike curiously. "Have you noticed anything else?" She was going to give him an opportunity to come to his own conclusion before she spelled things out for him. He was quiet for several minutes. His brow knitted into a frown for a minute and he then looked back up at Jane.</p>
<p>"Like the fact that they're in love with one another?" he asked simply. Jane nearly choked on her breath at his words.</p>
<p>"What?" she gasped in shock that he'd even said it. Mike smirked at her.</p>
<p>"Jane, honey, I'm surprised at you. I thought women were supposed to be more observant than that. Brooke and Sam have had feelings for each other since long before the accident. And since then, they've only been growing closer. And I think, sometime during one of our trips away, something occurred between them," he continued.</p>
<p>"And you're all right with that?" Jane asked astonished. Mike's smirk became a grin.</p>
<p>"Maybe not all right, but solid enough in my own life to know that my daughter's health and happiness is what's important. And if she finds those things with Sam, I'm not going to get in her way," he said gently. He tilted his head and looked at Jane. "Is it a problem for you that they're involved?" Jane's mouth opened and closed for a few seconds as she tried to form a response through her shock.</p>
<p>"No?no I guess not. If you're OK with it, so am I. As long as they're happy, I suppose," she finally said, settling down next to her husband. Mike wrapped his arms around her and hugged her close.</p>
<p>"If they're happy, we're happy. Right?"</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke eyed her old Glamazon uniform with something akin to disdain as she rearranged her closet.</p>
<p>&lt;Damn that thing is ugly&gt; she decided. &lt;And I willingly wore it?&gt; She snickered. &lt;At least my prom dress was cute&gt; She frowned.</p>
<p>&lt;Huh?&gt; She hunted through her closet but said dress was no where to be found.</p>
<p>&lt;That's right, when Nicole tried to hit me and Sam pushed me out of the way, it got ripped when I hit the pavement. I threw it out a few days later?&gt; The thought stopped in mid form as she felt the now familiar rush in her head.</p>
<p>"Shit!" she hissed as her legs gave out from beneath her. Her head suddenly throbbed like she'd been hit with a sledgehammer and she saw spots in her vision.</p>
<p>"Not now," she pleaded to any god listening. "Please not now." She started to shake as a long overdue and hideous headache roared to the fore and caused her to curl up into a ball on the floor. She closed her eyes against the pain and started to rock as tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>"God, make it stop?" she begged quietly. "Sammy?" she called out for her love but Sam was out running errands and wouldn't be home for a while. Brooke was home alone as unconsciousness sped up on her and swallowed her.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke saw herself in the Novak with Sam, Lily, Carmen, Nicole, and Mary Cherry arguing over something. There was red writing on the mirror but she couldn't make out what it said. Everything was tilting back and forth to the side like a small boat being piloted badly. She seemed to be seeing everything as if through a distorted window and she could only hear snippets of what was being said.</p>
<p>"?inbred?webbed feet?"</p>
<p>"?question my sexuality?"</p>
<p>"?kissed Josh?"</p>
<p>"?shopped with Gwyneth?"</p>
<p>"?tell the truth?"</p>
<p>"Ladytime?"</p>
<p>"Me, an' Joe?an' Lil' Lily!"</p>
<p>She shook her head in confusion as she watched the scene play out. Piece by piece it started to make sense.</p>
<p>&lt;We were locked in there&gt; she thought slowly. &lt;And Nicole was making us confess our deepest darkest secrets. Bitch&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh God, I'm remembering! It's one of my memories coming back!&gt; Panic started to fill her as she realized that the walls were breaking down and that there was a real chance that Mouse was indeed on her way back.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh God, no! SAMMY!!!&gt;</p>
<p>"Brooke?" the voice was faint, so far away Brooke almost missed it.</p>
<p>"Brooke can you hear me?" it was Sam's sweet voice sounding so sad and scared that Brooke's heart ached. Like she was swimming underwater, Brooke started to fight her way to the source of the voice.</p>
<p>"God, should I call 911?" Sam's voice wondered worriedly.</p>
<p>&lt;I'm coming Sam! I'm on my way back to you, hold on just a second!&gt;</p>
<p>"Brooke, I'm scared, what's happened?" Sam cried quietly. She felt Brooke stir slightly in her arms and her heart started to calm down. It had leapt into her throat when she'd opened the bedroom door and found Brooke, passed out, bathed in sweat on the floor. She cradled the limp form lovingly as Brooke whimpered softly.</p>
<p>"Sam??" she groaned trying to open her eyes. Sam was worried that they were so glassy and unfocused. </p>
<p>"Right here, love. Do you need your pills?" she asked. Brooke nodded slightly and Sam only left her for a moment to retrieve the needed medication. She gathered the ill girl in her arms again and waited until Brooke's shaking subsided somewhat a long time later.</p>
<p>"What happened?" she asked, pressing a light kiss to Brooke's temple in comfort.</p>
<p>"Headache, hit me fast," Brooke muttered as she tried to relax in Sam's arms and forget that she had experienced a minor memory flash.</p>
<p>&lt;If they're ALL that painful, they can STAY lost&gt; she decided angrily.</p>
<p>"Are you OK now?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I think so. Help me to the bed?" Brooke requested. Sam nodded and all but carried Brooke to the bed and tucked her in.</p>
<p>"Want me to stay or go?" Sam asked, brushing at Brooke's blonde hair gently.</p>
<p>"Stay please," Brooke responded. Sam smiled and crawled into the bed, letting Brooke shift to use her as a cushion.</p>
<p>"As long as you want me to," Sam assured her, wrapping her arms around Brooke's middle and kissing the top of Brooke's head.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy," Brooke said as she tried to fall asleep and forget the incident that had just taken place. But somehow, she knew it was just the beginning. And she was scared to death.</p>
