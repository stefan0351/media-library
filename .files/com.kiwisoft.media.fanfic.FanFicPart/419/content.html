<!-- In Healing Arms \ Part One -->

<p>"You are in such trouble when I catch you Alexandra."
			Sydney growled. </p>

		<p>"Yeah, well, you have to catch me first." Alex teased and ran towards the house.</p>

		<p>Sydney was doing her best to wash down the horses. This, of
			course, involved a large, pressurized hose. Alex watched her friend tend to the horses,
			while she slowly approached her without being noticed. Initially her intent was to scare
			her lover, but once she saw the unattended hose, she lost all sense of control.</p>

		<p>After dousing Sydney unmercifully, Alex ran to the main house to
			seek the safety of Eddi, her aunt and best friend. She found Eddi asleep in her rocking
			chair in the family room.</p>

		<p>"Damn, now where can I hide?"</p>

		<p>"Oh no you don't. You aren't getting away this time little missy."</p>

		<p>"Now Sydney, you know I was only fooling around." She held her hands out in
			front of her and stuttered as she found herself backing away from a drenched, mildly
			agitated woman.</p>

		<p>"Fooling around eh? Just what does "fooling
			around" entail? You sneaking up on me, you grabbing a hose and soaking my skin, and
			then you laugh and run inside to look for cover?" She playfully stalked and growled.</p>

		<p>Alex just swallowed hard, not knowing what her Aussie lover had
			planned for her revenge. "Umm, yes?" She winced.</p>

		<p>Alex found herself being backed into the entertainment unit while
			Sydney drew nearer with every tick of the grandfather clock in the corner of the room.
			Sydney's breath tickled Alex's ear as she bent down to give a warning.</p>

		<p>"Paybacks are truly a bitch my dear Alexandra. And believe
			me when I tell you, I always get my revenge." Sydney purred.</p>

		<p>Alex found herself short of breath and completely at a loss for
			words, which was very rare for the young honey haired woman. She looked into the most
			challenging blue eyes she had ever seen, and knew she was no match for the tall raven
			haired woman staring down at her. She just had to wait until her time had come. It was
			very exhilarating to her senses. Sydney, she discovered, was a very creative person. 'I
			wonder if everything she does is as imaginative as the things she does in bed.' Her
			thoughts sent shudders throughout her body, and her movements were not lost by Sydney.</p>

		<p>"What's the matter Alexandra? Cat got your tongue?
			Hmm?" She smiled and gracefully exited the room leaving a slackjawed Alex resting her
			body against the entertainment center.</p>

		<p>"My God, what that woman does to me. Christ." She wiped
			her brow and made her way into the bathroom to wash her face and calm her nerves.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>A couple of months had passed since the two women had met. Alex
			had arrived to her Aunt Eddi's ranch after losing both of her parents in a tragic car
			accident. Her aunt had graciously opened her home and her arms to her niece. Living alone
			in Chicago with the emptiness that evolved around her, was not a life that Alex wanted.
			Her aunt's offer came as an answered silent prayer.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>The funeral went as well as to be expected. Most of Alex's family
			had attended the wake the previous night and attended the funeral procession the following
			day. Everyone gave their condolences to Alex not wishing to trade places with her for
			anything in the world. To lose both of her parents the way that she did, they half
			expected her to whither away herself. These people didn't know the strength inside this
			young woman. Neither did Alex at this time in her life. </p>

		<p>Her Aunt Edna arrived a week before the traditional formalities
			had begun. She had arranged the burial for her sister Donna and her husband Tom. She knew
			that Alex wouldn't know how to handle the arrangements by herself. Hell, she didn't even
			know what she was doing. How often do you have to plan such an event? Hopefully, this was
			one of the last times she would have to do it. Burying her own husband was hard enough,
			but now her sister was taken away, along with her husband. It was very surreal to her.
			'It's not nearly as hard on me as it is on her.' She thought to herself as she watched her
			niece hugging and talking with estranged family members.</p>

		<p>The day was almost over, and most of the guests had left Alex's
			home. The after gathering was nicely catered, and the mood was as light as it was going to
			get on such a tragic day. Alex just wished away her migraine as she forced herself to meet
			the sorrowful stares she received for the duration of the day. Eddi walked up to her when
			she thought she had had enough.</p>

		<p>"How are you honey? Do you want to call it a day? I can take
			care of the clean up down here."</p>

		<p>"No Eddi, I will help. It's the least I can do. You planned everything while I did
			nothing."</p>

		<p>"Nothing? Oh honey, you were finishing your schooling and had to move back here for
			the summer. You had plenty to do yourself. These things have a way of timing themselves
			very badly. Not that there will ever be a good time for this." She trailed off and
			found herself embracing a sobbing, scared little girl.</p>

		<p>"Oh Eddi......what am I going to do now? I have lost almost
			everything in a blink of an eye." She sobbed into her aunt's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"I know sweetie, I know. We just need to take things day by
			day. It's all we can do. But we have to keep going. Your mom would want that for you. I
			know she would have." She said as she cradled Alex's shaking body. " You want
			some tea?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah......I think it may help my head...it's just
			pounding..."</p>

		<p>"Alright kiddo, go sit down at the table, and I will bring
			two mugs with me. I gotta let out the last of our guests and I'll be in. We can talk if
			you want to. Or we can just stare, cry, scream, or whatever your lil heart desires.
			Okay?" She kissed the top of Alex's head.</p>

		<p>"Thanks Eddi, I love you so much. Thanks for being here for me."</p>

		<p>"Oh sweetie, there is no other place that I would be right now. Now scoot, I'll be in
			there in a couple of minutes."</p>

		<p>"Alright Eddi, I'm just gonna say goodnight to Tracey."
			She said as she watched her aunt go into the foyer of the house.</p>

		<p>Alex's best friend Tracey Miller came in from the front room and
			embraced Alex in a hug. "God hon, I'm so sorry. I wish there was more that I could do
			for you."</p>

		<p>"Thanks Trace, I know. I just can't believe that this happened. You know, two weeks
			ago I was just talking with mom about summer plans and I how much I couldn't wait to see
			her when I got home." Alex pushed back a sob.</p>

		<p>"I know honey, I know...." Tracey kept Alex in her arms
			until the fair haired woman pulled away. Tracey looked from her deep brown eyes into sad
			green ones and felt her heart break for her childhood friend.</p>

		<p>"I'll be alright Trace. Eddi's with me, you can go home if
			you want. I'm just gonna go to bed. I have the worst friggin headache."</p>

		<p>"Well that's not surprising. Take care of yourself Alex. I love you, you know."
			She winked at Alex.</p>

		<p>"I love you too Trace. Thanks for being here for me."</p>

		<p>"What are friends for?" She questioned as she ran her fingers through her mass
			of curly blond hair.</p>

		<p>"Well you are the best friend in the world. Good
			night." Alex hugged her friend again, kissed her cheek and watched her walk towards
			the front door.</p>

		<p>She padded her way to the dining room table and sat down.</p>

		<p>Alex's eyes roamed the room she was in. Every shelf on the
			bookcase had at least one picture of her or her parents. She scanned down to the rolltop
			desk and found a gift she had made her mother when she was ten. It was a picture frame
			that had "My Favorite Mom" etched into it, with a picture of her and her mother
			in it. 'Like I had more than one.' She said to no one. 'Now I don't even have one.....'
			She stopped and put her head in her hands and continued to weep.</p>

		<p>Edna made it back with the promised beverages and sat down next
			to Alex. She let her hand stroke Alex's back as she watched her swollen green-eyed niece
			down the healing liquid.</p>

		<p>"Alex, I want to ask you something, and you don't have to
			answer until you are ready, okay?"</p>

		<p>"What's wrong Eddi?"</p>

		<p>"Nothing Alex, I just want to ask you something."</p>

		<p>"Okay Eddi, shoot."</p>

		<p>"I want you to consider something for me." She said as she took one of Alex's
			hands in her own.</p>

		<p>"Alright......"</p>

		<p>"I would really love it...if you came out to live with me...in Montana. I know it's
			far away from your friends and your school, but you make friends like bees make honey, and
			well, we got schools up in Montana as well."</p>

		<p>Alex's face wrinkled up and she again began to cry.</p>

		<p>"Oh honey, I'm sorry. I should have waited to ask you that
			later on, I am so sorry."</p>

		<p>Sniffling, "No Eddi, don't be sorry. I am just so thankful to have someone in my life
			like you. Thank you so much for that. Please let me think on it though. I have so much
			here, it would be such a huge change for me. I just don't know if I am ready for more
			change. Is that okay? Can I answer you in awhile? I mean, I won't take forever, I just
			need some time to really think it over."</p>

		<p>"Of course sweetheart, take all the time you need. I'm not leaving for at least a
			week, so please, just think it over, and let me know. I just would hate to think of you in
			Chicago, by yourself. I mean, I know you have school and your friends, but this house,
			well, I know how many memories you have here. I just want you to be happy honey."</p>

		<p>"I know Eddi, and I love you for it. Thank you."</p>

		<p>"You are welcome, sweetie, and I love you back."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex was awoken from her reverie by a questioning stare.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry did you say something?"</p>

		<p>"Yes Alexandra, I asked if you were okay. You looked like you were a million miles
			away."</p>

		<p>"I was actually, I'm okay though, don't you worry."</p>

		<p>"When it comes to you, I worry. Just reflex, get used to it." Syd smiled and
			opened her arms to Alex.</p>

		<p>Alex buried herself in Syd's strong embrace. She loved when her partner let her guard down
			and was just Sydney; loving, nurturing, and warm. But there was something in her that
			couldn't keep that wall from building back up. Alex wished she knew what it would take. </p>

		<p>The last couple months had been wonderful. She had met someone
			that truly felt like the other half of her soul. There was trepidation behind the azure
			blues of her lover though. Sometimes she would find Sydney lost in thought. She looked
			frightened sometimes, but when asked, she always had something to say about it. Alex just
			let her think she was off the hook, when actually it saddened her to know she wasn't
			trusted enough to be let in on her secret. </p>

		<p>Sydney didn't trust anyone she thought to herself. Sure she had
			friends that she spoke of, and she would go out from time to time with them as well, but
			the only one with her full trust was Eddi. Alex was almost jealous of their relationship.
			They would have long talks that sometimes went deep into the night. Alex had tried many a
			night to stay awake with them, but sleep usually found her halfway through. Time and time
			again, she found herself in Syd's arms being carried up to their room to bed.</p>

		<p>Alex knew from the beginning that it would be an uphill battle to
			gain the trust of Sydney Thompson. It was, however, a fight that she had no intention of
			losing. The time it took for her just to give Syd a compliment and not have her read too
			much into, was exhausting. 'She must have been really hurt at one time. I just wish she
			would talk about it, maybe it would help her. She's got to know I would never do anything
			that would hurt her.' She mused as she pulled out of Syd's arms.</p>

		<p>"So, what do you want for dinner? I think I should
			cook." She smiled up at her lover.</p>

		<p>"If you think that cooking dinner is going to get you off the hook, you've got
			another thing coming." Syd smirked as she put her hands on her hips.</p>

		<p>"Sydney, I am sorry about the hose thing, really. Please forgive me."</p>

		<p>"Oh I forgive you my little city mouse, but I will have my revenge. Mark my
			words."</p>

		<p>"Revenge on what? What the hell did I miss?" Eddi walked into the kitchen to
			find the heated discussion.</p>

		<p>"Hey Edna, well it looks like your innocent little niece
			here likes to play with water." Edna peered over to look at a very amused Alex. She
			then looked back to Syd who looked as though she was waging war inside her head.</p>

		<p>"Now look here girlies, if anything gets broken, I will put
			the hose on ya both! Just calm yourselves, Christ Almighty, a girl takes a nap for five
			minutes and all hell breaks loose...."She trailed off as she went to the fridge to
			get some juice.</p>

		<p>"I swear to God, I don't know what gets into you
			girls." She said as she drank the juice from the container. She swallowed the liquid
			and looked into the stare of the two women.</p>

		<p>"What? It's not like either of you will ever drink out of
			this!" She said as she showed the prune juice to her niece and Sydney. "Can I
			help it if I like to be regular? Hell you should try it, you may get rid of some of that
			hostility!!" She smiled at them. " Then again, I didn't get sprayed with that
			hose either."</p>

		<p>"Hey! Who's side are you on?" Alex whined.</p>

		<p>"The dry one. Now what are you making for dinner? This girl
			is hungry!"</p>

		<p>Alex just rolled her eyes and began opening cabinets looking for
			some ideas for dinner for her two best girls.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>The fall semester came and Alex had decided that she would enroll
			for the Spring semester. Edna and Sydney had been very supportive of her decision and
			agreed that she may need some more time to get used to everything that has changed in her
			life. Starting a new school, in a new area, sharing a new home, with a new partner, and
			without her parents, was a little much for Alex to swallow at once. She was taking the
			days one by one and deciding that she needed it that way. </p>

		<p>Thoughts of her parents were very frequent and mostly came at
			night through her dreams. Many a night did Sydney wake to Alex thrashing about trying to
			fight off the demons in her head and in her heart while she slept. Sydney would always
			wrap her larger frame around Alex and instantly she found the tiny woman relaxing in her
			embrace. Alex would always thank her in the morning for performing the exorcism, which she
			so lovingly called her bouts with the nightmares.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Alex really wanted Syd to come to Chicago to see her home before
			it was sold. The house had been on the market for about a month or so. It was a hard
			decision for Alex to make, but it made sense. She was in no financial shape to maintain
			her parents home, so she gave in and called the family lawyer and then a Realtor. Her
			parents had left her quite a bit of money, but she wanted to use it for schooling to work
			on her journalism degree. Her cousin Jack had given her some tips on some stocks and
			mutual funds for investing, but she was scared to death of the stock market. It just
			didn't make sense to her. So for now her savings account had a little bulge in it.</p>

		<p>Alex's mind was alive at dinner, she was in the defensive mode.
			After she showered Sydney unmercifully with the hose, she was waiting for the turnabout.
			It was bound to happen sooner or later, she just wished it was sooner, then it would be
			over with. She decided that she would ask Sydney to come to Chicago with her tonight. 'I
			think she would really love to see it. I think Eddi could handle things for a week. Hmm,
			maybe I'll ask Eddi first just to make sure.' She thought to herself.</p>

		<p>"You are awfully quiet Alexandra. Are you alright?" Syd
			questioned her unusually quiet partner.</p>

		<p>"Yeah Syd, I am fine. Please stop worrying, really, I am
			okay." She looked at Syd with eyes that betrayed her truth. She had black puffy
			circles under her usually vibrant green eyes, which made Syd wish peaceful dreams for her
			every single night.</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, I will always worry about you. As long as I
			breathe, I will worry."</p>

		<p>"Hey take it while you can sweetie, it's hard to find someone that will do your
			worrying for you." Her aunt interjected.</p>

		<p>Smiling, "I guess you are right. Thanks Sydney, it means the
			world to me to know you care so much."</p>

		<p>"I do care for you Alex, very much. I think I always
			will." She said as she gently stroked the inside of Alex's wrist with her thumb.</p>

		<p>"Me too."</p>

		<p>"Well with that established, can I have some more of those potatoes? Alex you outdid
			yourself. I love AuGratin, they are my favorite."</p>

		<p>"Thanks Eddi, eat up. Sorry for the mushy stuff." She said smiling.</p>

		<p>"Not to worry, it makes me sleep better knowing you have
			someone in your life like Syd. I knew it was going to happen when I saw the first looks
			you two gave each other. It was priceless. It was loooove at first sight. Alex could
			barely eat and Syd kept staring at her during dinner." The two just looked at each
			other and blushed at their memories Edna was reliving.</p>

		<p>"It was quite the entertainment. I knew once I left for
			Indiana, I would come home to some kind of news. I am glad that I wasn't disappointed. Syd
			was just what you needed Alex, and I think the same goes for you my dear." She simply
			stated while pointing her finger at Syd.</p>

		<p>"Whaa.....? I....wasn......." Sydney started sputtering
			and looked at Edna with her eyebrows high into her bangs.</p>

		<p>"Yes you were and you did, so enough out of you." She waved her fork at Syd,
			while Alex just marveled at how well her aunt could work Sydney. 'God, I don't think there
			is another person on this planet who could get away with half the stuff Eddi does with
			her.'</p>

		<p>"Hey there, we lost you again..." Syd said breaking
			Alex away from her thoughts.</p>

		<p>"I was just thinking is all."</p>

		<p>"UH OH.." Edna and Sydney said in unison then laughed.</p>

		<p>"Cut that out!! The both of you!! You know......oh
			nevermind, I will never win against you both." She said exasperatedly through a
			smile.</p>

		<p>The two women just hi-fived each other and grinned stupidly at
			Alex, who in turn just rolled her eyes and continued to eat her delicious meal.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Hey Eddi, can I ask you something?" Alex walked in to Edna's room as she got
			ready for bed.</p>

		<p>"Sure hon, what do you need."</p>

		<p>"Well it's not a need really. Well, it's more of a want kind of thing. I was ahhh..
			just wondering if.. well if it won't be too much trouble...." Her aunt was patiently
			waiting for her request and interrupted her ramblings.</p>

		<p>"Good God girl, I'm not getting any younger here! Just ask me." Alex just smiled
			and reapproached her aunt.</p>

		<p>"Eddi I was wondering if I could take Syd to Chicago with me
			while I tried to pack the rest of the house up."</p>

		<p>Edna sat and pondered the question for a moment and realized this
			may be a good thing for both of them.</p>

		<p>"It will only be for a week or so I swear. I won't take her
			from her chores too long. Do you think we could?"</p>

		<p>"I think it's a wonderful idea Alex. I think it might do you some good to go back
			there for a bit. Syd tells me you haven't been sleeping all that well. Maybe you need to
			go there. Have you asked her yet?"</p>

		<p>"No not yet, I was waiting to hear what you thought, and she is your employee after
			all so I wanted to make sure that it would be OK. I just would hate it if I took her from
			you while you needed her........"</p>

		<p>"My goodness girl, you can talk at the speed of light. I am surprised I can
			understand you at all when you get going like that." She chuckled to her niece.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry Eddi, I am just really excited about this. I
			really want to go and take her with me. I would love for Tracey to meet her too."</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, how is Tracey doing?"</p>

		<p>"She is doing well, I talked with her last night actually
			and she really wants me to come and see her while I'm home....umm....visiting... anyway,
			she said to say hi to you."</p>

		<p>"God how long have you two known each other now, ten years? Fifteen?"</p>

		<p>"We have been friends since I was five. I have really missed her this summer. We
			usually sat poolside all summer or just hung out on the roof of her house and stuff. I
			missed that..." She trailed off and her aunt took her hand and squeezed it.</p>

		<p>"Does she know about you and Syd?"</p>

		<p>"Oh my God Eddi, she was the one that told me I was gay."</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah, about two years ago she told me that I was going to get fed up with not
			getting what I wanted from men. Then she said to make sure that dinner plans, on me of
			course, were arranged when I figured it out. I guess a "I told you so" kind of
			celebration." She giggled.</p>

		<p>"That girl is too much. So how did she take the news about
			you two?"</p>

		<p>"Oh please, my ears are still ringing. She is very happy for us though, and she can't
			wait to meet her."</p>

		<p>"Who can't wait to meet who?" Syd poked her head into Edna's room. "I was
			wondering what was keeping you." She said looking at the two women standing close
			together in a deep conversation. " Alright, what's up you two? You look as though you
			are conspiring against someone. It's not me is it? Cuz I can outrun you both."</p>

		<p>The two women started laughing and Alex wrapped herself around
			Syd's waist. "No hon, we aren't conspiring, I promise." She reassured.</p>

		<p>"That's a relief, I can't be too sure around you two."
			She turned herself to look at a smiling Alex in her arms. "Are you ready for bed
			sweetheart?"</p>

		<p>"Mmm, yes I am. Good night Eddi, we'll see you in the morning." Alex reached
			towards her aunt and gently squeezed her arm.</p>

		<p>"Good night you two." The two were just out of the
			doorway when Edna's voice picked up a bit. "And could you keep it down tonight? I
			almost called an old friend to keep me company last night." Alex couldn't keep the
			blush from flooding her entire body and Syd could do nothing but wink and smile at Edna as
			she closed her door.</p>

		<p>"Oh my God, I never thought she would hear us!!" A
			completely embarrassed Alex spouted.</p>

		<p>"Alexandra, you could wake the next county if you wanted
			to." She wiggled her eyebrows. "Not that I'm complaining, I rather enjoy your
			vocal skills, amongst your other ones."</p>

		<p>"Good answer mate." They laughed as they walked arm in arm into their room and
			closed the door for good measure.</p>

		<p>Alex walked to the bed and folded down the blankets and fluffed
			Syd's pillow as she has done every night for the last two months. She tossed her socks
			into the hamper and got under the sheets. Syd followed suit and assumed her position while
			Alex immediately snuggled into Syd's shoulder. It was a routine that the two women weren't
			willing to break anytime soon.</p>

		<p>"Syd..." </p>

		<p>"Yeah baby?"</p>

		<p>"I need to ask you something."</p>

		<p>"Do I need to get up?"</p>

		<p>"Oh no, nothing like that."</p>

		<p>"OK, then ask me. Ow!" She giggled at Alex's small jab to her ribcage.</p>

		<p>"OK, well, lately I have been thinking."</p>

		<p>"So, I have noticed. Is anything wrong?" Syd asked curiously.</p>

		<p>"No honey, just listen, please." She paused and took a
			deep breath. "I really want to go back to Chicago." Sydney's body stiffened and
			she sat up to look at Alex, willing the tears away from her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Chicago? Wait Alex, what are you saying? We just started something really great
			here. Do you really want to leave now?" Alex sensing a little bit of a
			misunderstanding gently pressed her fingers to Syd's lips.</p>

		<p>"Sshhh. You didn't let me finish honey. I need to finish
			packing up the house and I wanted you to come with me. That's all, I swear."</p>

		<p>Relief swept through Sydney like a tornado and she thought she
			was going to pass out from the sensation of it all.</p>

		<p>"Sydney? Are you OK? You look as pale as a ghost." Alex
			said as she felt Syd's forehead and wiped away a thin layer of perspiration from her brow.
			'God she really hurt you didn't she? I hope we never meet, I won't be responsible for my
			actions.' Alex thought to herself.</p>

		<p>"I..uh......I... would love to go with you. I need to ask
			Edna if its alright though. She does depend on me to tend to the horses."</p>

		<p>"She said it would be a great idea. So....what do you think, next week all right with
			you?"</p>

		<p>"Sounds great to me. I think I need a vacation anyhow." She smiled.</p>

		<p>"Thanks Sydney you don't know how much this means to me. I
			can't wait for you to see the house. And, I can't wait for you to meet Tracey. You guys
			are going to get along great. I can't wait!! Thank you, I really mean that."</p>

		<p>"Honey, I am excited too. I have never been to Chicago."</p>

		<p>"Well we don't really live
			<i>in</i> Chicago, we live in the suburbs about 30 miles
			or so north of the city. But we can go down there if you want. Its going to be quite a
			different scene from here. It's much louder and so much more is going on all the time. I
			don't really miss that part of it."
		</p>

		<p>"Is your school near there?"</p>

		<p>"No, I went to the University of Illinois which was in Champaign. That's about 3
			hours from my house. It's kind of in the middle of Illinois." She had a sad
			expression on her face as she spoke of school.</p>

		<p>"You miss it already don't you?"</p>

		<p>"Am I that transparent?"</p>

		<p>"Like glass baby." Syd slowly sunk back to the bed
			dragging along with her a saddened teary eyed Alexandra. She kissed the top of her head
			and began to stroke her hair down her back.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry Syd."</p>

		<p>"For what?"</p>

		<p>"I am always crying it seems lately."</p>

		<p>"Honey it's okay, really. I am glad that I can be of some comfort to you. You know
			how much I care about you. When you are sad, I am sad. I will do what I can to make sure
			that beautiful face carries a smile whenever possible."</p>

		<p>"You are so good to me Sydney." 'How did she ever leave you?' She thought to
			herself.</p>

		<p>Alex turned to face her partner and gently kissed her lips. Syd
			returned the gesture and slowly deepened the kiss. Alex found herself opening her mouth in
			offering to Syd and was rewarded with a hot tongue probing her mouth. The two stayed like
			this for a long moment and then pulled back to stare into each other's eyes while soft
			hands caressed smooth facial features. They were breathing heavily and soon found sleep to
			be an option for much later.</p>

		<p>"God baby, you make me so crazy." Syd purred into
			Alex's ear.</p>

		<p>As shivers went throughout Alex's body she found herself pulling
			at her shirt to free herself of any obstacle keeping her away from Syd's bare skin. 'Just
			another advantage of Syd sleeping naked, not much to take off.' She mused to herself. Syd
			helped Alex with her shirt and her underpants followed shortly afterwards.</p>

		<p>"I still don't understand why you dress at all for bed. I
			never let you keep anything on anyway."</p>

		<p>"I'm slowly seeing your point." She giggled as she pulled Syd on top of her.</p>

		<p>Syd slowly steered her thigh between Alex's and both moaned at
			the contact that was made. Alex's wetness was no mystery to Syd who relished the fact that
			she was the cause of the excitement. Alex raked Syd's back with her fingernails as she
			felt the larger woman's tongue leave a blazing trail from her ear to her breasts. Syd
			latched on to one of Alex's erect nipples and began to gently nip at the tip. Alex arched
			into the touch and began stroking Syd's long dark hair.</p>

		<p>"God sweetheart you feel so good."</p>

		<p>"Good, so do you. You taste incredible" She said with a smile.</p>

		<p>Syd brought one of her hands to the other nipple and began to tease it as she continued to
			suckle the other. Syd slowly began to grind her thigh into Alex's sex. Alex's moans grew
			louder and her body began to rock against Syd's thigh. Syd could feel her younger
			companion's desire building as she slowly moved up Alex's body and gently purred into
			Alex's ear.</p>

		<p>"You know what sweetheart?" She said as she licked her
			earlobe.</p>

		<p>"What baby? Tell me...." Alex panted in response.</p>

		<p>"Paybacks are truly a bitch." She smiled and gently
			rolled over to her side of the bed leaving a thoroughly aroused and confused Alex to her
			musings.</p>

		<p>"Whaa.....you can't be serious?" She managed to squeak
			out.</p>

		<p>"Good night Alexandra, sweet dreams." She feigned sleep
			waiting for the explosion she knew was coming, trying desperately not to let out the laugh
			that was raging within her.</p>

		<p>"Sydney Elizabeth Thompson, you aren't going to just leave
			me like this are you?!?!" She was completely beside herself.</p>

		<p>"Like what honey?" She had to control her voice before
			she broke out into laughter.</p>

		<p>"OH.....MY GOD. This is about the hose isn't it? You are
			going to let me sit here and stew in my totally "I WANT YOU NOW" state because
			of the hose, am I right?"</p>

		<p>"Uh huh...that's right." She couldn't control the
			giggle that leaked from her lips.</p>

		<p>"Oh no you don't. You can't raise my heart rate like this
			and just roll over knowing that I won't be able to sleep for at least a week....."
			Alex stopped as she heard Sydney's laughter betray her every whim. "You are laughing
			at me, aren't you?"</p>

		<p>Trying to regain her composure, "Yyyes..as a matter of fact...I am......" the
			fits of laughter continued and slowly she turned over to see bright green fire looking
			down at her. 'Uh oh, I'm in trouble.' Syd thought to herself.</p>

		<p>"Now Alexandra, you know you had it coming. I told you I
			always get my revenge.....and I did." She tried to be stern as she spoke with a grin.</p>

		<p>"You feel better honey?" Alex purred as she slowly maneuvered Syd to her back.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, I guess I do, thanks for asking."</p>

		<p>"Oh I'm not asking...........I'm telling........you feel better" She climbed on
			top of Sydney and straddled her midsection. Her wetness was spreading over Syd's stomach
			and the woman underneath couldn't control her erratic breathing once she felt it.</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah, you feel much better baby." Alex said as she
			ground herself faster into Syd's strong abdomen. "Oh yeah........much better.
			Uungh" Syd couldn't help but grab the sides of Alex's hips and move her own body into
			her lover.</p>

		<p>"Oh no, you wanted your fun, now I want mine. You can just
			sit there and watch." Alex sternly looked down at Syd's face that changed from
			confusion to passionate desire as she watched Alex move her fingers over her clit and
			began moving her fingers in a strong circular motion.</p>

		<p>Syd licked her lips as she watched her lover writhe above her in
			ecstasy. She could tell that Alex was close and wanted so much to take her. Her senses
			were on overload giving her the strength to flip Alex over onto her back and thrust two
			fingers deep inside of her. Alex's protests turned into moans of pleasure. Syd continued
			to thrust into her lover as she moved southward to taste the sweet nectar waiting for her.
			She glided her tongue over Alex's clit creating another wave of building excitement from
			Alex. </p>

		<p>"Oh baby, God...... you feel so incredible. I'm so
			close.....ungh" Alex panted out.</p>

		<p>"Mmm.....let it go baby.....that's it......." Syd
			managed to get out while trying to keep rhythm with Alex.</p>

		<p>She felt the younger woman's fingers grasping at her hair and
			knew she was almost there. Syd sucked at the swollen nub and gently nipped at its tip
			sending Alex over the edge of reality and directly to the clouds. Syd stayed where she was
			and absorbed all of Alex's body spasms. Alex's body began to calm as she caressed the head
			still nestled between her thighs.</p>

		<p>"Ah.... revenge is a beautiful thing. Don't you agree
			Sydney?" Alex kidded as her breathing reached its normal pace again.</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah....there's nothing like it." Sydney agreed and
			just smiled up at her lover. She climbed up her partner's body and cradled Alex in her
			strong arms.</p>

		<p>"Now my sweet Aussie, what is your pleasure? You know I will
			give you whatever you want." She said as she nipped Sydney's neck below her ear.</p>

		<p>Sydney shuddered and felt her body move into Alex's in a subtle
			sensuous movement.</p>

		<p>"I think I know what you need." She traced a circle
			around Syd's nipple. "How's this? Do you like this?"</p>

		<p>"Oh Alexandra, you feel so good."</p>

		<p>"You know I will never tire of your voice cooing my name like that. Did I ever tell
			you how sexy your accent is?"</p>

		<p>"I keep telling you I do not have an accent." She giggled and nipped against
			Alex's neck sending shivers down the young woman's back.</p>

		<p>Alex moved her fingers around Syd's bellybutton and playfully
			inserted one of her fingertips inside. "You know, if I dipped somewhere else, I know
			it would be much wetter, what do you think?"</p>

		<p>"I think you should test out your theory on that."</p>

		<p>"Don't mind if I do." Alex slowly moved her hand through the soft dark curly
			hair above Sydney's passion. She lightly traced her lips without quite touching her
			desire.</p>

		<p>"God Alexandra, please, don't tease. I need to feel you
			inside."</p>

		<p>"I will take you Sydney, don't worry about that." With that Alex slowly moved
			through Syd's river of desire and reveled in the feel of her lover. She gently brushed
			against Syd's clit causing her to jump from the contact.</p>

		<p>"Ohhh, we are a bit excited now, aren't we?"</p>

		<p>"Mmmmm, God you are such a quick study."</p>

		<p>"I had a wonderfully patient teacher. You feel like silk under my fingers Syd. I love
			when you get this excited."</p>

		<p>"Only for you.....ungh......please........"</p>

		<p>"What do you want Syd?"</p>

		<p>Alex's movements were making speech almost impossible for Sydney. She rubbed Syd's clit in
			slow sensuous movements keeping in time with her body's movements. She played with the
			outside of her entry and gently dipped one finger into the dark wetness.</p>

		<p>"Is this what you want Sydney?"</p>

		<p>"Oh yes.....God yes....more.." Syd panted out.</p>

		<p>Alex shifted her own body so that she was completely above Syd
			and staring down at her writhing lover. She plunged another finger inside Syd and was
			rewarded with a low growl from within her lover. She knew what Sydney needed and what Alex
			herself wanted more than anything right now.</p>

		<p>"I need to taste you Syd. I want to feel you release into my
			mouth. Get ready cuz here you come baby."</p>

		<p>Alex thrust her fingers deep into Syd as she lowered her mouth to feast on her lover. She
			stroked Syd's clit fast and with purpose. She lapped and lapped and felt the stiffening of
			her lover above her.</p>

		<p>"Oh God Alex....I'm .....ooohhhhhhhh!!!!!" She panted
			as her release shrieked through her body.</p>

		<p>Alex grabbed the back of Syd's hips to ride out the greatest
			feeling she had ever known. She opened her eyes to look at Sydney only to find the
			precious blues staring right back at her in the throes of passion. Alex knew right then
			and there that the feelings she had for Sydney were a love deeper than any fairy tale she
			had ever read. To watch her lover's desire in her eyes sent chills throughout her body and
			she knew that Syd loved her, even though the "L" word had never come up.</p>

		<p>"Aleeeex............I...........unghhhh!!!"</p>

		<p>Alex felt the last of Sydney's tremors cease as her name was being called out again and
			again. She slowly withdrew her fingers as a whimper of protest left Sydney's mouth. Alex
			moved up her lover's body to kiss her with a passion and a tenderness that only Syd could
			evoke from her. The two just cuddled and kissed themselves into a peaceful loving sleep.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Down the hall and in her room, Edna just threw her pillow over
			her head, again.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>The sun always came up earlier for Alex than she'd like. This
			morning was nicer than most though. She knew that in just hours, she would be back in
			Chicago, and in the house that she grew up in. She couldn't wait to show Syd her home. She
			was excited for Tracey to meet the love of her life as well. The only thing that would be
			missing would be her dad and mom. She knew going back was going to be hard, but she was
			also hoping that in some way, it would help her with her demons. She was just grateful
			that she had someone like Sydney that understood all of what she was feeling and still
			wanted to go through that with her.</p>

		<p>Sydney was looking forward to this trip. Her mind was reeling
			from so many emotions. She was terrified at her feelings for Alexandra. In the same breath
			she was so happy and tingly whenever she and Alex were around each other. The problem was
			that she was being brought back to a time in her life when she was the most vulnerable,
			and that scared the living shit out of her.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Come on love, come to the States with me. You will love
			Montana. Please, just think about it Syd, for me. You know how much I love you. Let me
			erase of all your painful memories from here. We will be so happy together." Sharon
			pleaded.</p>

		<p>"My entire life is here babe. I grew up here. My family's
			station is here, you know how much that means to me. It's the only thing I have left of my
			family, well other than Tim, I don't know if I can just up and leave it."</p>

		<p>"That's what I would be doing though hon. School isn't for me, you know that. I can't
			stay here, it's just not me. The States is my home, I need to go back there. I would
			really love it if you would come with me. I guess it's a test of our love if you follow
			suit. After everything I have done for you, I can't believe that you wouldn't come with
			me."</p>

		<p>"Don't doubt my love for you babe, you know I love you. I would do anything for you,
			you know that. This is just a huge step for me. Let me talk with my brother about the
			sheep station. If he gives me a proposal for it that I can live with, I will take you up
			on your offer. I promise."</p>

		<p>"Oh love, you don't know how happy that makes me. I just know you'll make the right
			decision."</p>

		<p>'I hope so.' Sydney thought as she hugged her lover.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"So Timmy, do you really want it? I mean is this something
			that you know you really want? I mean I know you know how to run it, you basically showed
			me everything I needed to know. I just want to make sure that this is something that you
			want for your life, your future." Syd said to her brother.</p>

		<p>"Syd, when you took over the station, I wasn't really happy about not being a part of
			it. It's the last thing mom and dad had together. It was always apart of our family; Dad,
			Mom, and Bi......." Tim paused at his own words. </p>

		<p>"You know you can say his name Tim. It won't bother me. Unless it bothers you to say
			it. I really hope that it's not the case though. He was a good kid Tim. Unfortunatly he
			was in the wrong place at the wrong time. If anyone should be silenced from saying his
			name, it should be me. I know what the courts said, but it doesn't take away the fact that
			I was apart of what happened to him. I can now say that I have forgiven myself. But that
			is only because you forgave me too. So for the hundreth time, thank you for that. I would
			hate going through life without my older brother. I know that you will be a great foreman
			to the station too. Please know Tim, that I never thought you had any desire to have it,
			otherwise you KNOW that I would have shared it with you. It would have been great to run
			it with you. I just figured since you didn't say anything, that you were okay with it. I'm
			so sorry."</p>

		<p>"Aw sis, don't apologize. I am just happy you thought of me before you sold it to
			some Joe off the street. Consider it sold, to the best and highest bidder. About Billy, I
			do forgive you. Sometimes it is still hard to hear his name though. He'll be around
			though, I'm sure of it. Mom and dad too. I think I will be surrounded by them everyday
			that I am there."</p>

		<p>"I think so too Tim." Syd paused as she rose from her chair to look out to the
			fields of her backyard. "The only thing that I hate about this deal, is the fact that
			I am going to be leaving now. I will miss you. We have finally come together you and I. I
			am so sorry for all the years that we didn't speak. I just didn't understand death and why
			it happens. I didn't want to get it. You saw what I became, I was a monster that didn't
			know what love really was. God, and after Billy and mom died, I wasn't sure that I wanted
			to live at all. I am out of that hell now, and I finally know the value of family and
			loved ones. You are all the family I have left now. Well, besides Sharon that is. I love
			her with all my heart Tim. She believed in me when I didn't believe in myself. Even after
			everything that has happened in my life, she is willing to take a chance on me. I just
			don't want to disappoint her in any way. There isn't anything I wouldn't do for her."</p>

		<p>"I know, but....."</p>

		<p>"But?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah but....but why couldn't you have fallen for a woman who lived on this side of
			the planet?" They shared a smile and embraced each other. "I will miss you too
			sis, I love you ya big softy...God she has you so whipped doesn't she?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah well, love makes you do the strangest of things Timmy. Let's call dad's lawyer
			and legalize all of this eh?"</p>

		<p>"You betcha."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Alright sweetheart I'll see you when you get home. Don't
			work so hard. I love you."</p>

		<p>"I love you too Syd, I should be done with this project hopefully in about four hours
			or so. I will be home as soon as I am done here, I promise."</p>

		<p>"OK Shar, take care hon." Syd said as she hung up the
			phone.</p>

		<p>"You too. Bye." Sharon said as she placed the receiver in the cradle on her
			desk. </p>

		<p>The tall red head sitting across from her smiled wide as she
			approached Sharon like a hunter searching out prey for its meal.</p>

		<p>"We got four hours then. You are mine until that time runs
			out then." She said as she straddled Sharon's lap.</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah baby, we got a loooong time. I can do a lot to you
			in four hours. What'cha got on under that skirt baby?" Sharon said as she grabbed
			Tina's naked ass from under her skirt.</p>

		<p>"You'd know better than anyone. Oooh yeah, I like that." Tina cooed into
			Sharon's ear.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"My poor workaholic, I think I will bring her a little
			picnic. She will be so surprised to see me. God I can't wait to see the expression on her
			face." Syd excitedly said as she packed up some dinner for her lover. She threw in a
			bottle of wine for good measure, and made her way out the door.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Oh God........yes.......right there...ungh" Tina panted from on top of the
			desk. Sharon had her head buried in between Tina's thighs trying hard to keep up with the
			writhing body above her.</p>

		<p>"Yeah baby....I can feel how close you are......come on
			baby....come for me.." Sharon coaxed as she thrusted her fingers deep inside her.
			"I love the way you sound, God, I love you Tina....ungh......" Sharon said as
			she felt herself slipping over the edge of the precipice.</p>

		<p>The two women found a rhythm between them and began to thrust
			their bodies for all that they were worth.</p>

		<p>"Yes...yes.....yes!!!" Tina shouted.</p>

		<p>"Yesssss Tina....Oh God!.....yes."</p>

		<p>The two were oblivious to Sharon's door opening with Syd walking
			in. Her smile soon changed to a fierce angry howl.</p>

		<p>"NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!" Syd shouted out as she witnessed
			the hugest betrayal of her life. Her heart was breaking into a thousand pieces and their
			was nothing she could do about it.</p>

		<p>The two women climaxed just as Syd walked in and couldn't stop
			their bodies until it was too late. Sharon tried to move from underneath Tina, but
			couldn't coax her body to move.</p>

		<p>"Syd....Syd wait." Sharon panted.</p>

		<p>"What Sharon, is this where you say this isn't what it looks
			like? Too fucking bad that won't work in this case. Who's your whore? Nice to meet you I
			am Sydney Thompson, Sharon's girlfriend."</p>

		<p>Tina saw the six foot, black haired woman approach her and began to get very nervous. She
			wasn't sure what she had planned.</p>

		<p>"So Sharon, aren't you going to introduce us? We do have so
			much in common don't we....?"</p>

		<p>"Tina."</p>

		<p>"Ahhh Tina. Well at least I know what name to shout out when I break your fucking
			head open!"</p>

		<p>"Syd, No!!!" Sharon shouted.</p>

		<p>"Oh sticking up for your new fling Sharon? Too fucking bad.
			I gave up everything for you, and this is what I get in return? You Bitch!!! You took me
			halfway around the world just to spit in my face? Fuck Sharon, you couldn't have done that
			in Australia?"</p>

		<p>"Oh Syd, you act as if this never happens." Sharon said very desensitized.</p>

		<p>"It doesn't happen to me."</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry you feel that way, because frankly Syd, it's happening to you, right
			now."</p>

		<p>Syd spit at Sharon and grabbed Tina's head by her hair.</p>

		<p>"Give me one reason I shouldn't beat the shit out of you
			right now?" Syd threatened.</p>

		<p>"It wasn't my idea, it was Sharon's." Tina pleaded.</p>

		<p>"Oh you see Sharon, your little puta can't even take responsibility for her own
			affairs. How old are ya darlin? Eighteen, nineteen? Robbing the cradle don't you think
			Sharon? God you are pathetic."</p>

		<p>"Oh Syd, just look at us. You are the pathetic one. You are
			so gullible. Someone tells you that they love you, and you leave yourself open for things
			like this. I saw what you were in school, I knew what you had done. I knew that I could
			have you if I made you believe that I loved the person you were. All of your baggage was
			nothing more than an invitation to have my cake and eat it too. I had more than just Tina
			here, and I always had a beauty like you on my arm wherever we went. Everytime I came home
			I had someone waiting for me in my bed. What a beautiful relationship." Sharon smugly
			said as she nonchalantly slid into her chair and crossed her naked legs.</p>

		<p>"So everything was just a lie? So I was just a pretty play thing with a fucked up
			life, that you took control over? So I was just a hood ornament for you, a God damn
			trophy? You fucking cu.......no, I won't say it." Syd let go of Tina's hair and less
			than gently patted her head. "I will just leave you to your pet. Don't come home
			tonight if you know what is good for you. I will be gone by the morning. Don't come
			looking for me either, I don't want to be found by you." Syd smiled as she warned.
			She kicked over the bag of food and slammed the door to Sharon's office as she left.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>"Sweetheart? Are you packed?" Alex broke Syd of her
			reverie.</p>

		<p>"Hmm? I'm sorry hon, what did you say?" Syd asked.</p>

		<p>"Sydney are you alright? It looked like you were out of it
			when I walked in." Alex walked over to Syd and placed a hand on Sydney's arm. She
			felt her flinch under her touch and slowly pulled away.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry Alexandra, I didn't mean to......"</p>

		<p>"Sydney, I know you are bothered by something, I just hope
			that one day you will feel that you can trust me enought to talk about it." Alex said
			comfortingly as she picked up the rest of her bags and went downstairs.</p>

		<p>'So do I love, so do I.' Alex thought to herself as she wrapped
			her arms around herself for comfort.</p>
