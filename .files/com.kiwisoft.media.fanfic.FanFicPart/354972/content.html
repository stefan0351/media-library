<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 31: An Evening Together -->

<p>At Rebecca's insistence, they stopped at the boarding house to
		relieve the gunslinger of some of her weapons. Josie had started to protest, but the young
		woman explained that it was bad enough that her clothes would make people nervous, but a
		pair of deadly revolvers might make the other patrons too scared to eat. While the bounty
		hunter reluctantly acknowledged this fact, she still made a point of carrying her knives
		in their various locations. There was no way she was going to be completely unarmed.</p>

		<p>Josie received a curious, and mostly disgusted look from the
		waitress, but stubbornly waited to be seated. She was not surprised when the short, round
		woman led them to a table in the far corner, near the kitchen and most likely the least
		enjoyable spot in the place. As they made their way, Josie kept her hand resting lightly
		on the small of Rebecca's back, guiding her through the maze of chairs and potted cactus
		that littered the area. A stout man at a nearby table rose and held the chair out for
		Rebecca as they arrived. Josie was pleased by the respectable gesture, as unusual as it
		was in that part of the country, but nonetheless kept her eye on him for any sign of
		trouble. He smiled and returned to his wife and son at his table.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, sir," Rebecca said sweetly as he pushed her
		chair in. He moved over to get Josie's chair but the gunslinger waved him off and pulled
		it out herself. They waited ten minutes for the waitress to pass by and drop off the
		menus. Rebecca thought that Josie was fuming inside as the minutes passed, and then she
		was certain of it from the slight tenseness in the gunslinger's jaw and the almost
		imperceptible narrowing of her eyes. Yet Josie said nothing, merely studying the patterns
		on the utensils or glancing about the room. Rebecca had tried to make small talk, but the
		bounty hunter's attention kept shifting to the other patrons and the young woman gave up.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, what was that?"</p>

		<p>"I said the beef looks good," Rebecca replied, hoping
		to draw Josie's attention back to her and away from the rest of the room. The gunslinger
		gave a quick lopsided grin and looked at the menu for the first time.</p>

		<p>"I have a hankering for the elk. Where is that woman
		anyway?"</p>

		<p>Josie said, looking around the room. As if she could feel the
		blue eyes boring into her back, the waitress turned around from chatting with a patron and
		saw that the two women were ready. The glare she received from the tall one in black
		guaranteed that she would return immediately with their drinks.</p>

		<p>While waiting for their dinner to arrive, Rebecca chatted about
		the new things she had learned from the medical book that the gunslinger had purchased.
		Josie smiled and paid attention, noting that the young woman didn't mention any diseases
		or give any detailed descriptions that might have affected the enjoyment of dinner.
		"You know, Josie, it says that some of the best medicines are known only to the
		Indians." </p>

		<p>"That's true," the gunslinger replied, letting a bit of
		pride show through. "The medicine elders - you call them medicine men - know far more
		about herbs and roots than the white man does."</p>

		<p>"I'll bet I could learn a lot from one of them,"
		Rebecca mused softly. The words did not escape Josie's ears as an idea formed in her mind.
		Perhaps she could take her to the Cherokees, to her people, and let her learn the
		medicines of old. The gunslinger was well aware of the need for good healers.</p>

		<p>"I'm sure you could, Rebecca. Would you like that? To meet a
		real medicine elder and learn from her?" In her mind, the gunslinger was calculating
		just how far they were from the Cherokees, less than three weeks by wagon over the
		Cimarron Crossing. It was more dangerous than the Cheyenne Trail, but was also more
		direct. The trail would take them at least another week to ten days, adding considerably
		to the cost of their supplies.</p>

		<p>"Oh Josie, I'd love to. I could learn so much more than the
		book can teach me," she said enthusiastically. The waitress arrived with the platter
		containing their dinners. Both women were silent while the not-so-nice-smelling woman
		plopped their plates down in front of them.</p>

		<p>"Anything else?" she asked, moving quickly away without
		waiting for an answer. Rebecca reached out and placed her hand on top of the gunslinger's
		fist.</p>

		<p>"Josie...."</p>

		<p>"I'm fine. Just don't care for the likes of her," she
		replied as she relaxed her hand and pulled it out from under the blonde's grasp. She
		sampled a piece of the elk before speaking. "I can take you there." </p>

		<p>"Take me where?" she replied around a mouth full of
		food. </p>

		<p>"To meet a medicine elder. To learn healing." She
		stabbed another piece of meat with her fork. "I can take you to the Cherokees,"
		she said as she popped the morsel in her mouth and began to chew.</p>

		<p>Rebecca's fork stopped halfway to her mouth as she looked across
		the table dumbfounded. Josie smirked and took another bite of food. "Of course if you
		don't want to go..." she said idly, twirling her fork in the air.</p>

		<p>"Yes! Yes, I want to go," the blonde said
		enthusiastically as soon as her voice returned. "Oh Josie, that would be so
		wonderful!" </p>

		<p>"Now hear me out," the gunslinger replied, setting her
		fork down and leaning in to give her most serious expression. "It won't be easy.
		We'll be going through dangerous territory."</p>

		<p>"I don't mind," Rebecca interrupted. Josie gave a quick
		frown.</p>

		<p>"The first thing you have to remember is not to interrupt
		me. </p>

		<p>Next is to pay attention; don't make me tell you something
		twice." She waited until Rebecca nodded solemnly. The gunslinger leaned back in her
		chair and stared at her half-eaten dinner. "Of course, that's only if you're going to
		keep riding with me. Any time we find a town that you think you'd be happy in...."</p>

		<p>She didn't get to finish her thought as Rebecca bolted from her
		chair and gave the seated woman a hug. Josie stiffened noticeably but still managed to put
		a smile on her face for the blonde's sake. "Rebecca, not in public," she hissed
		quietly but gently. The young woman gave one last squeeze before returning to her seat,
		smiling with a glow that melted just a little bit more of the ice surrounding the bounty
		hunter's heart.</p>

		<p>The pair strolled down the street, the warm meal and dessert
		still settling in their bellies. Despite the waitress's surliness, they still managed to
		get two large pieces of pie for dessert, of which Rebecca ate hers and half of the
		gunslingers. Josie deliberately shortened her normally long gait so the shorter woman
		wouldn't have to walk fast to keep up. Truth be told, the bounty hunter was actually
		enjoying the evening. The night air was the perfect temperature; the lights from the
		buildings along with the half moon cast enough light to see easily. There was a gaiety
		about the night as families and couples headed for the theater, all chattering away happily. Men stopped
		to shake hands with each other while the wives exchanged pleasantries and, judging from
		the conspiratorial giggles in some cases, the latest gossip. As they reached their
		destination, Josie noted that the stout, balding man that held Rebecca's chair at the
		restaurant was standing outside the entrance to the theater with what she could only
		assume was his wife and son. The father touched his fingers to the brim of his bowler and
		nodded as the women passed. Rebecca smiled and wished him a good evening, although her
		attention was drawn more to his son, a dapper young man who was most likely only a year or
		two older than her.</p>

		<p>Rebecca went up and down the aisle, pointing out possible seats
		for them but the gunslinger shook her head at each one. None of the available adjoining
		seats were in the aisle. Josie spotted what she decided to be the perfect location, not
		caring that it was already occupied, and headed for it. Her long strides took her there
		quickly and by the time Rebecca caught up, the young men who had been sitting in the
		desired seats were already heading up the aisle, suddenly deciding that the view would be
		much better somewhere else.</p>

		<p>"What did you say to them?" Rebecca asked as she took
		the inside seat. Josie flopped back casually into hers, a knowing smirk on her face. She
		crossed her long legs, placing her booted foot up on her knee with the toes pressed
		against the seat in front of them. </p>

		<p>"I suggested that they be gentlemen-like and offer their
		seats to a couple of women," the gunslinger said with feigned innocence.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh, that's why they hightailed it to the back,
		huh?" the young women replied with a grin. "I can just imagine what you said to
		intimidate them." She leaned over and spoke in hushed tones, as if she wasn't stating
		the obvious. "You are intimidating, you know."</p>

		<p>"Can't be too bad; haven't been able to get rid of you
		yet," Josie quipped without thinking. Rebecca lost her smile and straightened up,
		fixing her gaze on the stage.</p>

		<p>"Do you want to, Josie?" she asked fearfully, not
		daring to look at the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>Her mind raced; the skills and techniques she had used over the
		years to avoid any kind of commitment or responsibility snapped into place as the answer
		came to her. "How can I get rid of you, Rebecca? Even if I tried, you'd probably just
		follow me anyway," she said as she gave the young woman a playful shove on the
		shoulder. Rebecca reacted well, grinning at the tease and settling back in her chair, but
		inside she noted that Josie deliberately avoided answering the question. She thought about
		pursuing the matter, but decided against the possibility of putting a damper on the
		otherwise enjoyable evening. Josie was glad that Rebecca turned her interest to the men
		scurrying about the stage, getting it ready for the performance, rather than in continuing
		the conversation.</p>

		<p>A polite cough drew their attention to the aisle. The man with
		the bowler and his family stood patiently and waited for the gunslinger to sit up and pull
		her long legs in so they could pass. As the young man did so, his leg brushed up against
		Rebecca's knee. He apologized immediately, taking the seat next to her as he did so.</p>

		<p>"I'm so sorry, Miss," he said, his accent clearly that
		of a yankee. "Oh, how rude of me." He wiped his hand on his britches before
		reaching out to grasp Rebecca's hand and placing his lips briefly on the back of her hand.
		"Lance," he said by way of introduction, and looked at her inquiringly.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca," she replied. He kissed the back of her hand
		once more before releasing it.</p>

		<p>"I'm most pleased to make your acquaintance, Miss
		Rebecca."</p>

		<p>Despite his dapper appearance and impeccable manners, he still
		managed to earn a warning glare from the gunslinger. She learned long ago to trust no one,
		especially those who appear to be the trustworthiest. It was nothing compared to his
		mother's look as she reached down and grabbed him by the earlobe. "Lance, I'm sure
		the young lady didn't come to the theater to listen to you all night, talking that sweet
		molasses talk of yours. Now you move over and leave her and her mother alone."</p>

		<p>It was all Rebecca could do not to burst into a fit of laughter.
		Lance was unceremoniously led by his ear to a seat further down while the gunslinger
		glared at his mother's back. The young woman leaned over and whispered in the still fuming
		Josie's ear. "I guess we do make an odd pair of cards, huh?"</p>

		<p>"I do not look old enough to be your mother," Josie
		hissed back, fully insulted. Rebecca chuckled silently and gently tapped the gunslinger's
		leg reassuringly.</p>

		<p>"I know, Josie," she said, trying to sound convincing,
		but her smile remained. The lights were extinguished moments later, leaving only the stage
		visible to the audience. A man stepped on stage to the roar of clapping. Rebecca leaned
		over, her smirk now absolutely mischievous. </p>

		<p>"Are you going to read me a bedtime story, mother?"</p>

		<p>Without taking her eyes off the stage, Josie leaned over until
		her lips were just a hair from the young woman's ear. "Keep it up and you'll be
		sleeping with Flossy, darling daughter," she teased back.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The play was a slapstick comedy about bumbling robbers trying to
		hold up a stagecoach. Josie rolled her eyes when she saw the two robbers prance out on
		stage riding stick horses and wearing lace scarves over their mouths. "It's supposed
		to be funny Josie," Rebecca whispered at the frowning gunslinger.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh," she said sarcastically as they watched the
		two robbers run into each other and fall down. The rest of the audience laughed
		uproariously. The gunslinger slumped in her seat, doing her best not to look too bored.
		Rebecca was smiling and apparently enjoying the antics on-stage. The stagecoach prop was
		brought on-stage, complete with the 'helpless damsel in distress' riding inside. The
		robbers circled the wagon on their stick horses, yelling at the woman to toss her
		valuables out. Josie straightened up in her seat slightly. "That's not how you rob a
		stage."</p>

		<p>"Oh, that's right. You're the expert," Rebecca teased,
		drawing a smile from the gunslinger as she realized how silly she was being. "That's
		better. Now sit back and enjoy the show."</p>

		<p>"Shh!" Lance's mother hissed at the chatty young woman,
		despite the fact that most of the theater was laughing at the activities on stage. The
		damsel in distress was now out of the stagecoach and running around after the robbers, who
		had given up their stick horses, beating them repeatedly with her bag. At this Josie gave
		a chuckle and relaxed visibly. Within minutes the bounty hunter was laughing along with
		Rebecca, both thoroughly enjoying the show.</p>

		<p>When the show finished, everyone got up at once to leave.
		Unfortunately, the people in the doorway seemed intent on talking to each other and not on
		getting outside. Grumbling and complaints were heard from the men and women waiting to
		leave. Josie leaned over and whispered in Rebecca's ear. "Stay right behind me."
		She put on her most intimidating face and tapped the shoulder of the man in front of her.
		"Move, now."</p>

		<p>"Miss, 'taint no way you gonna get out. That's Charlie up
		there jabbering. He don't never shut up," the man said.</p>

		<p>"You want to get out of here?" Josie said loudly, her
		voice carrying above the din to reach the ears of the frustrated patrons. Several shook
		their heads in the affirmative or yelled "yes" back at her. "Let me
		through. I'll make them move."</p>

		<p>"You? A woman?" a large and rather dangerous looking
		man sneered. Several of his buddies started to laugh until they watched her grab his meaty
		arm and twist it up behind his back, sending him up on his tiptoes.</p>

		<p>"Still think I can't make them move?" she asked
		rhetorically as she released his arm. The patrons moved back to let her through, with
		Rebecca following closely behind. The crowd realized that the tall woman would, in fact,
		get Mouthy Charlie out of the way and started to close up the space behind her, all trying
		to be the first ones out in case a good fight got going. Rebecca reached out and hooked
		her fingers around the top of the gunslinger's belt. Josie turned her head slightly,
		making sure it was her friend that was attached to her before continuing to make her way
		through the crowd.</p>

		<p>"So how's Bertha?"</p>

		<p>"She's doin' fine, yep. Her little doggie be due to birth
		them pups near about anytime now..." Charlie said as he felt a very firm tapping on
		his shoulder. "Go 'round. There's room," he said without looking around. The tap
		changed to a firm poke. "Tarnation, what in blue blazes..." he turned and faced
		the bluest eyes he'd ever seen just as the firm hand that was poking him now took hold of
		a fair amount of his hair.</p>

		<p>"Didn't your mother ever tell you it was rude to block other
		people's way?" she said as she bodily escorted him out of the doorway and into a
		nearby trough. She was rewarded with a chorus of cheers from the crowd as people finally
		made their way out of the theater.</p>

		<p>Rebecca caught up with Josie just as she felt a soft touch on her
		shoulder. The young woman turned to find the dapper young man standing there nervously
		twisting his hat in his hands. "I uh...just wanted to say that it was nice meeting
		you, Rebecca."</p>

		<p>"It was nice meeting you too, Lance," she replied
		shyly, feeling her cheeks warming.</p>

		<p>"Lance! Get over here and stop pestering that young
		girl," his mother called. He quickly grabbed Rebecca's hand and kissed the back of
		it.</p>

		<p>"'Bye,", he said grinning foolishly, and returned to
		his mothers side before she decided to yell again. Rebecca sensed the gunslinger standing
		just behind her.</p>

		<p>"He's nice," she said a little dreamily. Lance turned
		around and waved, smiling even more when she returned the gesture.</p>

		<p>"You ready?" Josie said a bit more harshly than she
		meant to. Her blue eyes stayed on the young man as the family walked further down the
		street. The gunslinger couldn't put her finger on it, but something about him annoyed her.
		He was almost out of sight when Rebecca turned to look at her.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, did you say something?"</p>

		<p>"It's getting late," Josie replied, slightly annoyed at
		being ignored.</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry, Josie. I just..." she gazed at the darkened
		street where moments ago Lance had waved at her. The dreamy look settled on her face
		again. "He's nice," she said softly, apparently unable to describe him any other
		way.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh, let's go." This time the gunslinger started
		walking, her long strides forcing Rebecca to jog to catch up. Only then did she slow down
		to a more reasonable gait.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" the tentative tone made the gunslinger stop
		and turn to look at her. Rebecca looked down at her boots. "Um...are you mad at me
		for something?" she asked softly. The wave of guilt passed over the bounty hunter as
		she realized that she was taking her feelings for the boy out on the blonde. Instantly her
		features softened and she put her hand on Rebecca's shoulder gently.</p>

		<p>"No, I guess I'm still mad at that codger that was blocking
		the door," she moved closer and put her arm lazily around the smaller woman's
		shoulders. "Look up there, Rebecca," she said pointing at the stars that
		twinkled brightly in the clear night. "It's like you can almost reach out and touch
		them."</p>

		<p>"Yes," the young woman replied softly. "They're so
		pretty; the way they sparkle, it's just like little diamonds in the sky." She started
		humming the children's melody to herself and was completely surprised when Josie joined
		in. Rebecca smiled and put her arm around the taller woman's waist, giving her a squeeze.
		The gunslinger returned the gesture of affection before pulling away.</p>

		<p>"Come on, sprite. Let's get back," she said, giving
		Rebecca a friendly smile as they started walking again.</p>

		<p>The cool night breeze fluttered in through the window as both
		women got ready for bed. The moon cast enough light for them to see the bed and barely
		make out each other, so there had been no need to use the lantern. Josie sat down next to
		her on the bed and pulled off her boots, quickly putting them as far away from the bed as
		possible. Rebecca untied the thin bow at the neck of her dress and stood, wiggling her
		arms out of it while turning her back to the gunslinger. She reached down and pushed the
		dress past her hips, letting it slide down to the floor. Josie placed her guns in a
		convenient location near the bed, making a mental note to clean them in the morning. She
		stripped down to her drawers and pulled the covers back on the bed. Rebecca straightened
		out the sleeves on her flannel nightgown and crawled into bed, scooting up against the
		wall to make room for her friend.</p>

		<p>Josie loosely wrapped an arm around Rebecca's waist. "Is
		this all right? There's not much room on the bed..." she said, knowing full well that
		there was plenty of room on the straw filled mattress. Somehow it just felt right to hold
		the little sprite in her arms. Rebecca reached down and patted the strong hand resting on
		her belly.</p>

		<p>"It's fine," she replied, smiling in the darkness. She
		felt so safe and protected in Josie's arms, as if just being in her presence was enough to
		make all her worries disappear. She sighed contentedly and nuzzled her head deeper into
		the pillow.</p>

		<p>"Good," the gunslinger whispered, moving just a
		fraction of an inch closer. She was so close that they ended up sharing the same pillow. A
		thin smile crossed Josie's lips as she drifted off to a sleep undisturbed by nightmares.</p>

		<p>The knight fought valiantly, slaying one dragon after another in
		the quest to rescue the princess. At last the hero was victorious and knelt before the
		fair maiden. Try as she might, the sleeping women couldn't make out the knight's face when
		the helmet was removed. All she could see was a dark head bending down to kiss the
		princess. Slowly the lips moved closer until only one thin beam of light passed between
		them. The light became less and less until total darkness ended her dream.</p>
