<!-- Legend \ Chapter 2: Conversations -->

<p>Buffy and Willow sat on the couch as Giles was in the kitchen talking with Angel and Cordelia trying to find out any information they might have on Vlad Tepes Dracul's return.</p>

<p>"Wills, Can we talk"</p>

<p>"Sure, We can always talk"</p>

<p>"Why"</p>

<p>"Why what Buffy"</p>

<p>"Why is all this happening. Wasn't enough that a neutered Spike is running around Sunnydale, and that there is some secret group running around capturing vampires and demons for who knows what purposes. Then if that isn't enough Oz leaves hurting you in the process. So why now, with all this going on does this Vlad guy have to show up"</p>

<p>"I don't know Buffy ," Willow then looked at the slayer with a look of confusion. She paused for a second then simply stated , "You noticed."</p>

<p>"Noticed what"</p>

<p>"That I was hurting, after all there is so much going on in your life with Spike the commandos and everything Hellsmouth"</p>

<p>Buffy seemed hurt that Willow thought she hadn't noticed, "Of course I noticed. Willow I care for you, your my best friend, When you hurt I hurt to", She then proceeded to give Willow a big hug.</p>

<p>After the hug had ended Willow looked at her, "If it helps any Oz's departure made me sad but it didn't hurt that much"</p>

<p>"It Didn't"</p>

<p>"I was going to break things off with him, but he sorta beat me to the punch" </p>

<p>Buffy sat there for a moment pondering Willows last statement, "You were going to break up with him, I thought the two of you were happy"</p>

<p>"We were, he was a great friend, but I just didn't love him anymore"</p>

<p>She knew she probably shouldn't ask, but the slayer couldn't resist "Why"</p>

<p>Willow didn't answer the question she just sat there lost in her own train of thought. &lt;Should she tell the truth, did she dare express the emotions that have been ravishing her mind the last few months&gt; </p>

<p>Buffy was afraid she had went to far and carefully spoke, "Earth to Willow, you still there"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm still here"</p>

<p>"Look Wills, I am sorry if I pushed to far. I shouldn't have asked the question" said the slayer, her eyes filled with apology</p>

<p>"No, it's not that"</p>

<p>"Then what is it", Buffy asked unsure of what was happening in Willows mind.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure how to answer it, even if I should answer it"</p>

<p>"Then don't answer it", Buffy softly spoke not wanting to force Willow to do something she didn't want to</p>

<p>"Buffy, I want to answer it just not right now, not here.", Willow then looked Buffy directly in the eyes, "However since you put me on the hot seat I got a question for you"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, fire away"</p>

<p>"Are you over Angel"</p>

<p>"That's easy, Yes", replied the slayer, relieved at how easy a question she had gotten, "Is that it"</p>

<p>"No, if your over him then why have you been shooting every guy who ask you out down in flames."</p>

<p>Buffy thought to herself for a second, &lt;Willow knew how to put someone on the spot when she had to&gt; "I need to think that one over, how about if we give each other our answers tonight after I get back from patrol."</p>

<p>"Sounds fair," Willow replied, very happy that she didn't have to answer Buffy's question right away.</p>

<p>"Then tonight it is, lets go and see what's going on in the Kitchen"</p>

<p>The two girls got up and started to go into the kitchen when the doorbell rang. Buffy went over to the door yelling in the general direction of the kitchen, "I got it"</p>

<p>The slayer stood in the open door way, rage filled her eyes. She was clenching her fist so tight that her knuckles were turning white. Her body seemed to tremble in anger as she coldly stared at the three who stood on the porch before her. Only one thought raced through her mind, &lt;What the hell are they doing here.&gt;</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Miss Summers" said Quentin as he looked at a very angry slayer.</p>

<p>"Giles you better get your butt out here, NOW" Shouted Buffy</p>

<p>Giles ran out of the kitchen to see what was wrong. Then he saw that Quentin, Wesley and Megan were standing on his porch and Buffy looked like she was two seconds from staking them. Thinking fast on how to resolve the situation he carefully spoke, "Buffy would you please let them in. I asked them here to help us and they agreed."</p>

<p>"Giles what is going on here, have you lost your mind", Buffy said as she stepped aide allowing them in. She carefully eyed them as they passed by her and walked over towards Giles.</p>

<p>"Buffy, we need them"</p>

<p>Buffy's words were laced with bitterness as she silently recalled their betrayal, "I need them like I need a whole in the head"</p>

<p>"You don't understand, they are here to help and I suggest we listen to what they have to say"</p>

<p>"Oh I see, and just forgot what they did to both of us" </p>

<p>"Buffy, what happened was done in the past, but now we must deal with what is going on in the present and that is that Vlad Tepes has returned. All of us have to put the past behind us, if we are going to stand a chance"</p>

<p>Buffy stood there clenching her fist and not even responding to Giles.</p>

<p>Quentin looked to the slayer and spoke, "Miss Summers, I know your upset but Giles is correct. We have come to help in what ever way we can"</p>

<p>Buffy verbally lashed out at him, "And why would that be, after all you haven't exactly been that helpful in the past."</p>

<p>"In the past you did not need our help as much as you do now" Retorted Quentin</p>

<p>"And I don't need it now, after all Vlad, Dracula what ever you want to call him is a vampire, Right."</p>

<p>"That is Correct, but...", Before Quentin could finish Buffy cut him off.</p>

<p>"Then I find him, stake him and it will be over with."</p>

<p>"It will not be that easy Miss Summers, Vlad Tepes is not your everyday vampire"</p>

<p>"I've beaten the master, Acathla, Kakistos, even the mayor. I did all of that without the councils help, and I can do this without the councils help"</p>

<p>Quentin did not know what to say, how to get through to the slayer, "Giles can you have to help us on this one"</p>

<p>"Buffy you got to listen, Vlad Tepes makes you average vampire look like the Avon lady. Did you forget how many slayers I told you he had killed" Pleaded Giles, his voice echoing the desperation that had made him call England in the first place.</p>

<p>He was starting to get through, Buffy stood there looking at Giles as his words hit home. Here mind recalled what he had said earlier and it and it made the hairs on her neck stand up &lt;Fifty slayers&gt;.
</p>

<p>Willow grabbed Buffy's hand wanting to comfort her best friend. She then looked at the Quentin and the others then to Giles, "What exactly is this vampire"</p>

<p>Quentin looked at Giles and when Giles nodded to him he spoke, "Vlad Tepes Dracul is a walking nightmare. Even before he became Vampyre he did things that one would think only demons were capable of. Once he became Vampyre he gave new meaning to the word horror." </p>

<p>Seeing that Quentin was having trouble getting out the words to describe this true monster, Giles took over "He stalked Europe killing anyone and anything that stood in his way. Every slayer and watcher that was sent to destroy him never returned. This gained him royalty status among other Vampires and in time they even came to worshipped him as if He their God"</p>

<p>Giles had spoken all that he could bring himself to say and his last few words were fluttered, That is when Wesley took over, "Buffy you are aware of what a master vampire is."</p>

<p>"Yes, so this Vlad is a master Vampire"</p>

<p>"Not just a master Vampire, he is THE MASTER VAMPIRE. All other vampires will now that he has returned follow him and do his bidding. He is stronger and more powerful than any vampire that is know to exist. This is mainly because he barley had a soul to loose, before He was turned. As a man he craved cruelty, destruction, and vengeance and becoming Vampyre only increased his already dark heart. He is the embodiment of evil, dedicated to death and destruction of all that stands before him." </p>

<p>Wesley had finished speaking and now no one said a thing, they just stood there waiting for the slayer's response. It seemed as if time was standing still as they all stood there in silence, Buffy tighten the grip she had on Willows hand. She had heard what they all had said and the hurt she still felt over their betrayal seemed not to be that important any more, she knew that she would have no choice but to accept their offer and for the first time in a long while she was truly afraid of what the night held for her. </p>

<p>They had talked the rest of the day there at Giles, and even after all that talk no one was sure what to do, they didn't even know why he had returned or what he was planning. Buffy had learned that The female was named Megan and that she was some kind of mystic, brought to try and determine what Vlad Tepes Dracul was up to but so far all her spells had been unsuccessful. It had then been decided that Everyone would return to there homes before sunset and the council members would stay with Giles so they could get more research done and possibly uncover something that they were missing. Giles also had insisted that Angel and Cordelia stay with him and they had agreed to. </p>

<p>Everyone seemed to be shaken up a bit when Buffy had insisted on going about her normal patrol to see if she could find out anything. Only when Angel had offered to go with her did they finally relent to the slayers will, and now here they were walking the cemetery, each one hoping not to run in to Vlad Tepes.</p>

<p>"Buffy are you O.K."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not"</p>

<p>"Don't worry they will find a way to beat him", Angel said trying to comfort Buffy but unsure of his own words.</p>

<p>"And what if they don't"</p>

<p>Angel had no answer for that, the very thought of the destruction the master vampyre would bring if he wasn't stopped was more than he would dare think of. So they walked in silence. Then they heard the sound of a fight up ahead. The two of them causelessly approached from the trees, remaining concealed from whoever or whatever was just a few yards away.</p>

<p>Before them where were three of the commandos and they had cornered Spike. One of them shot him with some kind of stun gun and he dropped to the ground. She was contemplating rescuing him and trying to find out if he knew anything about the reappearance of Vlad Tepes when Riley approached the group.</p>

<p>"Finn it's good to see you, were have you been" Said the commando holding the weapon.</p>

<p>Riley looked at his former friends and spoke, "I have been with the master"</p>

<p>"What master" questioned the commando as he pointed his weapon at Riley.</p>

<p>Riley pointed to the trees behind the commando, "The master"</p>

<p>As all three commandos spun around, the one with his weapon pulled was grabbed by the neck by a figure that had suddenly stepped out from behind a nearby tree. The figure then violently flung him to the ground and quickly was upon another one of the commandos. The third commando pulled his weapon and was ready to fire when a vamped out Riley jumped him from and sank his teeth into the neck of his former comrade draining him of his life force. The figure held his victim in his hands and all the sudden with the flick of his wrist snapped the boys neck like it was a twig. Buffy was about to go help the remaining commando and capture Spike when Angel grabbed her and held her back. The figure stepped out of the shadows and began walking towards the last of the commandos. He reached down and sunk his fangs into the commando's neck. After that he looked at Spike and spoke.</p>

<p>"William the Bloody allow me to introduce myself. I am Vlad Tepes Dracul."</p>

<p>With that Spike stood there in awe gazing into the face of the master vampyre before he spoke, "What do you wish of me," </p>

<p>Buffy an Angel were running towards campus as fast as they could. Both of them in shock over what they had just witnessed and neither of them wishing to face the master vampyre.</p>

<p>Back at the cemetery Vlad was talking with Spike as they walked around the tombs with Riley in tow.</p>

<p>"Tell me William, what have they done to you"</p>

<p>"They put something in my head, I can't kill. It`s driving me bloody nuts."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to kill again"</p>

<p>"Yes of course I do. Its so much fun"</p>

<p>"Good, I have recently discovered some information that can correct your problem. However first we must gather some of my children so we can retrieve it, and rescue the others of our kind"</p>

<p>Angel had dropped her off then rushed back to Giles to tell them what had happened. Buffy now stood out in the hallway still shaken up over what she had just witnessed and partially afraid to go through the door, afraid of what might happen when she gave Willow her answer, and spoke the truth. She had been standing there for five minutes trying to get up the courage to walk through the door but couldn't get her body to move. She knew no matter what the outcome her live would change forever once she stepped through the door and that shook her up more than actually seeing Vlad Tepes had done. </p>

<p>Another fifteen minutes passed before she was able to reach out and turn the door knob. She stood in the open doorway wanting to go inside and reveal her heart but afraid to.</p>

<p>"Buffy are you coming in or are you just going to stand there looking at me."</p>

<p>"I saw him", She replied trying to delay the inevitable.</p>

<p>"Saw who", Willow inquired concerned that something seemed to be upsetting Buffy.</p>

<p>"Vlad Tepes Dracul"</p>

<p>Willow jumped out from behind her desk and rushed over to Buffy who was still standing in the doorway. Her eyes filled with worry as she looked at the blonde, "Are you O.K."</p>

<p>"Yeah, He didn't see us but Spikes and Riley are with him now"</p>

<p>"Riley?"</p>

<p>"Is now a vampire"</p>

<p>"Oh, my" Willow looked at Buffy then continued to speak, " look it's been a rough night, If you don't want to have are talk I'll understand"</p>

<p>Buffy thought about Willows words for a second, "No, I can't keep what I have to say inside any longer, no matter what the outcome", she then stepped into their dorm room and closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>They both sat on their own beds looking at one another each of them wandering who would speak first and hoping it was the other. It was Buffy who finally gave in. "Willow, the question you asked me"</p>

<p>"Yes, what about it"</p>

<p>"The truth is that I keep turning everyone down because I am in love with someone already"</p>

<p>Willow noticed the sadness that filled Buffy's face as she spoke, "In love that's great but why so sad"</p>

<p>Buffy took a big gulp of air as she gathered her courage, it was now or never she told herself. "I have been in love with her for a few months now and don't know how to tell her"</p>

<p>"Her?"</p>

<p>"Her." </p>

<p>Willow thought about what about what Buffy had just said. She knew that this could make her revelation quite happy or even more painful than she could imagine. Buffy was in love with another girl, but what if it wasn't her.</p>

<p>Seeing her friend just sit there and look at her made Buffy uneasy, she was starting to feel that her telling the truth about her loving Willow was going to turn out badly, but there was no going back now, she had went to far. "Willow I'm sorry, I've shocked you. If you want me to leave I will"</p>

<p>Willow quickly recomposed herself, "No, don't leave. I think it's great. Who is she?" Willow felt a wave of nervousness rush over her, she knew that all her hopes for happiness depended on Buffy's answer.</p>

<p>"Her name is Willow and she`s my best friend"</p>

<p>Willow couldn't believe what she had just heard, her answer was just made very easy. "Buffy you asked me why I didn't love Oz any more even before he left"</p>

<p>"Yes," Buffy spoke wondering what was going through Willows mind after all she had just confessed her love for the redheaded , "I did"</p>

<p>Willow got up, walked over to Buffy and sat beside her, "The reason was because I had fallen in love with you"</p>

<p>Realizing what was happening between them the two girls hugged one another affectingly, their hearts filled with happiness on the love they had just discovered, both of them knowing that their lives had changed for the better. In that moment there seemed to be no one else in the entire world, it was just the two of them and they didn`t want it to ever end.</p>
