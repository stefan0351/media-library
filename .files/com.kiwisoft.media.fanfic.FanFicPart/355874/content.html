<!-- Knowing Me, Knowing You \ Episode 3 -->

<p>I spent most of Thursday feeling sick with excitement. You'd think I'd never been on a date before and I suppose, technically, you'd be right. I mean, I have gone places with people that I've liked, but never have called it an actual date. The term seemed so high school, and back then I barely spoke to anyone, much less had anyone to go out with. </p>
		<p>I imagined Aaryn and I would be spending this time together trying to figure out whether or not we wanted to spend even more time together. And then I started worrying about what we would talk about, or if she'd think I could even keep up a decent conversation, and whether or not she thought I was cute, or if she would want to kiss me at the end of the night. Did I tell you I felt sick with excitement? It was more like just feeling sick. </p>
		<p>But I was determined to make it an experience and not an ordeal, and so, I arrived to pick up my date at precisely 6 p.m., as we had agreed. The dimness of the bar had made me come to the conclusion that Aaryn was quite a looker, but seeing her in natural light made me lose track of my senses. She was breathtaking, her dark green eyes glinting with playfulness as she climbed into the car and leaned over to kiss me on the cheek. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She smelled like a mixture of raspberries, cream, and Chanel no. 5, and I tried to keep myself from being so obvious about inhaling her, but that was nearly impossible.</p>
		<p>"Are you all right?" she asked, smiling at me.</p>
		<p>"You smell really nice," I said dreamily, and then blushed when I realized that I hadn't meant to say it out loud.</p>
		<p>"Well, thanks Janna. I'm glad to see I'm having an effect on you already."</p>
		<p>My tongue seemed attached to my throat and when I could form no words as a comeback, Aaryn offered a genuine laugh and ordered me to get her something to eat. I gladly put the car into gear and set off to do just that.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The place I chose was a nice bar and grill that I had been to a few times, and I was rewarded when Aaryn said that she had been wanting to try the place, but hadn't found the time.</p>
		<p>After we ordered our drinks and decided to share a plate of steak fajitas, I asked Aaryn about school.</p>
		<p>"Is this the interview portion of the date?," she laughed.</p>
		<p>"Well, I figured I would beat you to it."</p>
		<p>"No fair, I was taking a drink!," she pointed at her iced tea.</p>
		<p>"I still beat you," I grinned.</p>
		<p>"Fine, but I might as well get the whole, 'Tell me all about yourself' portion done as well."</p>
		<p>"Suit yourself," I smirked.</p>
		<p>"Okay, let's see. I'm an only child, my parents are both lawyers and they live in Orange County, which is where I was born. I don't get along too great with them, and that's a whole other story, but they pay for me to go to school, and send me money so that I don't have to work. I'm a Psych major, and this quarter has been especially tough on me. I haven't had a lot of time for anything, or more specifically anyone. </p>
		<p>But, finals are next week, and then graduation, so I basically have to decide what I want to do with myself. I can intern, or go to grad school and decide after that. Either way, I really don't know what I want, and I don't think I'm in much of a hurry to find out."</p>
		<p>Aaryn took a deep breath, then smiled. </p>
		<p>"There it is, Janna, the story of my life, in a nutshell. Not too interesting, but that's me."</p>
		<p>"Oh, it's very interesting, Aaryn," I said eagerly.</p>
		<p>"Janna?"</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"Do I make you nervous?"</p>
		<p>The question caught me so off guard that I almost choked on the drink that I was taking, and Aaryn reached out and grabbed my hand in concern.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," she said, "Are you okay?"</p>
		<p>"Great", I muttered, "just great."</p>
		<p>"Janna, tell me all about you," she asked.</p>
		<p>And so, over our dinner, I told her the short version of my life. How my teenage mother had abandoned me to the care of relatives, and how I hadn't seen her since, nor had I ever known my father. I told her about my work as a PR person for an Indian Casino, and how that had taken up a lot of my time. I also admitted that I really hadn't had a girlfriend in over a year, and the last girl I had dated was dating half the town as well. I told her about Karen, how we had met at work and how she was like a sister to me, even though she could be a pain in the ass sometimes. </p>
		<p>"There you have it," I said, taking a sip of my soda. "And the answer is yes."</p>
		<p>"Yes?," she wondered, a puzzled look on her face.</p>
		<p>"Yes, you do make me nervous, but I think you can understand why. I haven't met anyone that I've liked in a long time, Aaryn. I still can't believe I even asked for your number."</p>
		<p>"Well, I'm glad," she offered.</p>
		<p>"Glad you make me nervous?"</p>
		<p>"No, silly. Glad that you asked for my number."</p>
		<p>I couldn't contain my grin as I paid the bill and we walked back out to my car.</p>
		<p>I decided that from the restaurant I would drive down to the beach, hoping that Aaryn would enjoy walking along the shore as much as I do. I hadn't really planned anything for after dinner, mostly because I wasn't sure how things were going to go, and what if after dinner she realized that she didn't like me all that much after all and really wanted to go home? </p>
		<p>Have I ever told you that I worry about things way too much?</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>So there we were, our shoes left in my car, our matching khaki pants rolled up so that they would stay dry. Aaryn had joked that we were already dressing like one another, and I couldn't help but laugh. She had such an easy humor, able to poke fun at herself, and especially at me, but not in a hurtful way. She made me laugh more that night than I had in weeks, and it felt good to be around someone besides Karen who could do that. </p>
		<p>The sun began to set, and I took her hand in mine as we walked a little further down towards the pier, so engrossed in conversation that neither of us noticed how far we had walked until we were directly underneath the tall structure.</p>
		<p>It was then that she came towards me and put her arms around my waist, her blonde head against my chest and directly under my chin as I once again inhaled the wonderful scent that was her. </p>
		<p>"Your heart is beating really fast," she said as she looked up at me.</p>
		<p>"No, I think you're just hearing things," I replied, tweaking her nose.</p>
		<p>It was then that I realized how badly I wanted to kiss her, but being the big 6 foot chicken that I am, I didn't know exactly how to go about it. </p>
		<p>Should I ask first? Then it seems like I have no clue. Should I just jump in and go for it? But then what if she wasn't thinking the same thing and turns her face at the critical moment? Just as I was about to develop an ulcer, I hear her voice muffled against my chest.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Janna?"</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"I really would like it if you kissed me now."</p>
		<p>I swallowed whatever nervousness I had in me, and lifted her chin up so that our eyes met. I bent a little and lowered my lips onto hers, softly at first, until she gripped the back of my head and pushed me harder against her. Aaryn's tongue traced the outside of my lips before delving deep inside my mouth, and I let her explore to her hearts content. </p>
		<p>Even through our attempts at melding into one body, the cold finally got to both of us and we started to make our way back to the car, Aaryn's arm comfortably linked with mine.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Aaryn fell asleep on the way back to her apartment, her hand resting on my thigh, her light snores filling the car on the short drive. I figured she must be pretty worn out with school and all, and I didn't want to keep her out any later than necessary. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>When we arrived, I gently shook her arm, trying to wake her up.</p>
		<p>"We're here."</p>
		<p>"Where?," she asked, a little disoriented, rubbing her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Home," I replied, taking her hand and kissing it softly.</p>
		<p>"Didn't you want to stay out?"</p>
		<p>"Honey," I said, then couldn't believe that I had actually said it, "You seem really tired, and I don't want to keep you out. You need your rest for studying."</p>
		<p>"Are you mad at me?"</p>
		<p>"Why would I be mad?" I asked, hardly able to believe she had asked me that.</p>
		<p>"Well, I thought maybe you wanted to stay out."</p>
		<p>"No, we can stay out late another time, okay? Come on," I said as I got out of the car and opened her door for her. "I'll walk you in."</p>
		<p>So she led me by the hand through the little manicured walkways that led to her apartment, which wasn't very far from the gate.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>I stood at her doorway, hands in my pockets as she fumbled with her keys.</p>
		<p>"I had a really good time tonight Aaryn." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She opened the door and then turned to me, reaching up to bring our mouths together once more, the cadence this time a little faster, throwing me off a bit. </p>
		<p>She pulled away and smiled, walking into her apartment and calling over her shoulder, "You're coming in, aren't you?"</p>
