<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 2 -->

<P>Both a biological and an enhanced hand clamped down on the astrometrics console. B'Elanna married, while she did not need to eat very much or very often the little she did have in her stomach wanted to exit. Her Klingon bonded to that fool who's only redeeming trait was a glorified sense of direction. It was already intolerable to think of her in his arms, but to know it would be forever. She knew that her duplicate shared her thoughts and she believed that to have first lost B'Elanna to marriage, and then finally to death would have left her eager to accept destruction. Even with her enhanced intelligence she could not recall a time when she did not find the Klingon fascinating.</P>
<P>Even before her link with the Collective had been severed she had recognized the engineer's efficiency and had thought her ideal for assimilation. Now the notion of destroying that individuality was no longer acceptable, but she still found that she could spend an eternity studying her, cataloging every part of her, learning every detail. It had become a familiar process that initiated any time she perceived the Lieutenant, be it seeing her in engineering or at a staff meeting. Or something as simple as hearing her voice over a comm-channel. It began again as the doors to astrometrics opened and the individual in question entered. It was just as quickly interrupted when she realized who entered with B'Elanna. </P>
<P>The normal interactions between her and Voyager's helmsman had always been forced. Looks aside, he considered her rather stuck up. In her case her scorn was only tempered by her lessons in politeness from the Doctor and the Captain. Thomas Eugene Paris was wasteful, while his skill in piloting was admirable it was his only redeeming trait. He was petty, concerned with only his own desires even to the detriment of others. Waking moment that he did not spend on the bridge or in sickbay were spent in his own desires which only indulged his own petty wants while adding nothing to himself and expending as many resources as he was allowed. Her normal disdain was exacerbated by the conversation he was having with her klingon. "So, B'Elanna and Tom got married? Makes you think doesn't it?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna sounded annoyed as she replied. "Yes, and then they died, that makes you think too doesn't it?" He didn't even seem to acknowledge Seven as he stepped in front of B'Elanna. "She saw something in her Paris. Can you tell me you don't see the same thing in yours?" B'Elanna sighed as she was forced to stop so she did not run into the helmsman. "Tom, I don't know what she saw. I just know that I am not ready!" Paris seemed ready to say more as Seven intervened. "I hope you are ready to go over the data."  At first Torres seemed shocked, but as she came to her senses she the look of gratitude she gave Seven warmed her from the heels of her biosuit to the top of her hair bun. "She's right Tom, I have to get to work." The sandy haired helmsman looked from one woman to the other, and decided to relent. "Ok, we'll talk later?"</P>
<P>Torres seemed to roll her eyes slightly. "Yeah, sure, later. Bye Tom." With out another word he left. She moved to the console Seven was standing at and both women turned to the viewscreen. As they started to work B'Elanna looked out of the corner of her eye. While Seven was not looking at her like they did in engineering her posture seemed a little tighter then before. Again she wondered why she hadn't noticed these things before. "Thanks Seven. Ever since Tom learned about the other Tom and B'Elanna getting married he has went from suggesting to demanding." The slender neck turned so Seven could look at her and arch her implant. "I can't see anyone demanding anything from you, at least not successfully." B'Elanna laughed as Seven continued. "Don't you desire to marry Mr. Paris?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna's face suddenly turned downcast. "I thought it was, but it's more the IDEA of getting married. You know? Swearing your life to someone and all that. I think we all want that life partner." "Yes." When Seven heard the emotion that slipped into her voice she slammed her will up like a containment field keeping an internal environment. While she forced her eyes to stay on the screen she could feel those brown eyes burning into her. "With Tom it's the reality that bothers me. I mean on that other Voyager he wanted to have their honeymoon in 1920's Earth! I mean his hobby is one thing, but this is our honeymoon we are talking about!" Seven had recovered enough of her control to give B'Elanna a questioning look, which caused her to continue. "Ok not OUR honeymoon, but you get the idea." Her voice softened. "I guess my duplicates death has made me think about those things we leave undone. or unsaid."</P>

<P>B'Elanna shook her head in wonder. "This design is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. If they were not duplicates they would have beat us back to the Alpha Quadrant." "It is an efficient design. Most likely from all the shifts my duplicate picked up in main engineering." It was at that point Seven's smirk was noticed and returned, but distractedly because Torres noticed the dates on the extra shifts and noticed that they all fell after the marriage announcement. It caused a stab of heartache as she imagined Seven slaving away in engineering just to be close to some ill tempered engineer who was too thick to realize it. She was glad that Seven didn't look at her in close quarters like she did otherwise because her expression had grown tender, and it was her turn to observe. What B'Elanna didn't realize was that Seven was all too aware of B'Elanna's actions. While the close quarters prevented a visual examination she had learned to use her other senses, like she was now. Her hearing picked up the deepened pattern of the Lieutenant's respiration, and her sense of touch could feel each time B'Elanna Torres walked past or drew close. Even as she enjoyed the resulting sensations she chided herself. Lieutenant Torres did not feel the same, not here, and obviously not on the alternate Voyager. While it seemed unreasonable for her to choose a mate that had so little respect for her, or anyone it was still her choice. It was part of that individuality that she had learned to cherish as much as her efficiency. Even if she worried that the behavior of Lieutenant Paris would smother it.</P>
<P>Even as she enjoyed the engineer's attention she wished that it would stop. It caused her to think of things that were impossible, and that made them hurt all the more. Finally the logical part of her that had been cataloging the information looked at the situation, and it asked "Why was the Lieutenant looking at her in such a manner?" Initially she thought it was just because of her intervention in the conversation between her and Mr. Paris but that same logical part of her said that would be insufficient for the length of time that Lieutenant Torres was examining her. While the silence was exactly uncomfortable Seven still tried to break it. "Have you accessed the personal logs?" Since she was looking as she spoke she was able to see the engineer practically jump at the question.</P>
<P>"Personal logs? Why would we need to access them?" Seven tilted her head. "The observations of those involved could add to our understanding of the enhanced warp engines functioning. If you are concerned about reading personal logs I am sure that we can obtain the individuals permission in advance. Since I am already here to give my permission we can start with mine." Giving her permission to read her personal logs caused the strangest look to cross the face that Seven had already committed to memory. "Is there something wrong Lieutenant?" "No, no, your right I am sure the logs will have all sort of things we need to know." Despite the compliance she noticed the woman took a deep breath before bringing up the logs of the alternate Seven of Nine.</P>
<P>She was able to stay genuinely calm as they brought up the directory, while most would have been concerned about the revelation of personal details she knew what she had entered and could reasonably predict the entries her duplicate would make. While she would never burden B'Elanna Torres with her feelings for her the idea of sharing the other personal facts she felt comfortable recording gave her a pleasant sensation. B'Elanna seemed nervous as they opened the files and Seven spoke. "The files seem intact. It appears that I provided them with back up systems incase of degradation." The engineer's voice seemed thickened as she spoke. "I guess you wanted to make sure the universe heard what you had to say. I don't think we need to go back past the demon planet since we already know what happened." </P>
<P>While she was confused by the tone of voice she was strangely hurt by B'Elanna's desire to keep matters on purely professional concerns. The concerns seemed unfounded as they went through her personal logs. B'Elanna laughed when she heard Seven making allowances for things like Harry's chatter and seemed genuinely interested in her lessons with the Doctor. "I wish I had the Doctor there when I was learning all this." Seven tilted her head. "Why would you need the Doctor's assistance? You grew up among humans." The snort of laughter did not seem at all happy. "Yeah, but I'm not exactly human am I? Neither was my mom. Sure she taught me all the klingon manners, but when there weren't that many klingon's around you ended up learning the human niceties only after you made a fool of yourself." Seven noticed the distress and felt a need to remove it. "I am receiving the lessons and I still manage to embarrass myself."</P>
<P>The look of distress left B'Elanna's face as she turned to Seven and watched Seven turn to face her. "It's never easy Seven, but a sincere effort will get you farther then any lesson ever could. Something I probably should have told you after or 30th or so fight." The statement hit Seven with a wave of happiness. Her resulting smile caused her to crack a joke. "Why would you have waited?" Another unidentifiable look crossed the klingon's face. "I guess I was too busy fighting you." Seven's attempt to analyze what was wrong with B'Elanna nearly caused her to miss an irregularity in the files. "There is an inconsistency. The back ups indicate one file size, while the file is another." The normally emotive face seemed to become as emotionless as her own. "Probably just file degradation. I mean it went though the beacon's destruction and then the disintegration of the ship." Seven nodded, but did not seem at all convinced.</P>
