<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 30 -->

<p>There are certain rules that govern human existence, one of which is that
the only thing that moves faster than the speed of light in the natural
universe is the speed of gossip, which is directly proportional to the
scandalousness of the information to be gabbed about and spread around like
syphilis in a 19th century burlesque house.  The more damaging the
information, the juicer, the sexier, the better.  The place where this
phenomenon was first documented and studied were high schools, for nowhere
else on the planet-besides Hollywood-could you find a population of people
more willing and with more free time to spread and create this gossip
gleefully.  Days after Sam, Brooke and their respective associates partied
in a mightily hearty fashion at 'Sirens', anyone who was interested in this
verbal wonder would have done well to visit the hallways of Kennedy High,
for they were simply abuzz with hearsay that simply had to be passed along,
ripped apart and spread to the masses for general consumption.  Simply put
it had been a very good weekend for the rumor mill and this was a Monday
morning that was humming away.</p>

<p>Discussion Number 1:</p>

<p>"They were sooo Elizabeth Berkley and Gina Gershon from Show Girls!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes!  I saw it with my own eyes."</p>

<p>"What the fuck were you doing there anyway man?!"</p>

<p>"Gay cousin Andrew and his partner took me.  Free beer man.  Anyway,  I
swear to god at one point Brooke had her hand up Sam's shirt!  You should
have come … I know I did later that night."</p>

<p>"That's sick man.  So it was really hot?"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 2:</p>

<p>"How trendy.  I expected more from Sam really."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 3:</p>

<p>"I heard there was so much sexual tension you wouldn't have been able to cut
threw it with a Bob Vila chainsaw."</p>

<p>"You're so full of shit."</p>

<p>"I don't think so.  I'm telling you I heard that they were positively
ancient Greek about it.  Everybody saying so."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 4:</p>

<p>"Sleepovers at that house must be like the best in the whole wide world!"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 5:</p>

<p>"I don't know if that home needs improvement, but I'd sure like to be a fly
on it's wall."</p>

<p>"You don't seriously believe that shit, do you.  Come on.  Brooke's not
gay…Sam maybe, but not Brooke.  Whoever started this should have tried to
make it at least a little bit believable.  Like the Richard Gere gerbil
story.  Now that was juicy."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 6:</p>

<p>"I'm so serious, I half expected them to break it down on the floor.  Hands
were in naughty, naughty places."</p>

<p>"And how do you know about this?  Were you there or something?"</p>

<p>"Uh…no."</p>

<p>"I can't believe you went to 'Sirens', that place is a tackily decorated
STD."</p>

<p>"Yeah…well, you're ugly."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 7:</p>

<p>"I knew it.  Yes I did.  I so knew it."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 8:</p>

<p>"Ohmygod, I saw something like this on the internet!"</p>

<p>"You do know that they're not actually sisters don't you."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 9:</p>

<p>"I knew it, I knew it.  You can't have that much hate without there being
something underneath."</p>

<p>"Does that mean that you're actually secretly in love with Bio Glass?"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 10:</p>

<p>"That's hot man.  It makes me something else that starts with an 'h'."
High fives are exchanged.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it.  Rob said they were grinding it down hardcore man. He
said they were like getting freaky man."</p>

<p>"We gotta start going to 'Sirens' dude."</p>

<p>"Definitely man, definitely."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 11:</p>

<p>"Is this a new trend?  I hope we don't all have to start doing it.  First
Drew Barrymore, then Angelina Jolie, now this.  I don't understand.  Does it
make you skinner?"</p>

<p>"I'm not doing it.  I don't care if it is popular.  I think it's gross!"</p>

<p>"But does it make you skinner?  I'm just not into this Xena Warrior Princess
shit, you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  Do you think it works if you just read Maxim.  I can do
that, but I'd actually read it for the articles."</p>

<p>"Did you see the one with Love, she was talking about this avocado mixture…"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 12:</p>

<p>"Gay?  Like in an Elton John way?"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 13:</p>

<p>"I told you Brooke checked me out one time in the shower that time."</p>

<p>"Why would Brooke be checking *you* out if she has Sam."</p>

<p>"Hello?  Have you not been paying attention.  She's gay ... ish, I'm gay,
maybe she was looking for some nookie."</p>

<p>"Once again I repeat, why would she be checking you out when she's got  the
sexiest, most delicious woman in the Western hemisphere at home."</p>

<p>"Oh god, not your Sam fixation again.  You sound like one of those thirteen
year olds obsessed with the stars of the WB."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 14:</p>

<p>"What were *you* doing there?"</p>

<p>"I was checking out the guys…what do you think I was doing there.  Hot
Sapphic action you moron!"</p>

<p>"Somehow I get the feeling you really were checking out the guys."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 15:</p>

<p>"Did you say there was a video? I want the video dude."</p>

<p>Discussion Number 16:</p>

<p>"Brooke?  Who cares about Brooke?  What does this mean about Josh?  Be still
my throbbing loins!"</p>

<p>"He is in the musical."</p>

<p>"I know.  Why do you think I joined?"</p>

<p>"Because you secretly want to be La Barbara."</p>

<p>"Secretly, please…"</p>

<p>Discussion Number 17:</p>

<p>"This is my greatest fantasy come true.  Finally some grrlfriends that
actually look like the ones on T.V."</p>

<p>Thus, we have the gossip monger in their natural habitat.  Fascinating.</p>
