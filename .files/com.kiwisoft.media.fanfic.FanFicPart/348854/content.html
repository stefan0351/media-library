<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 9 - Sunlight-->

<P>The cool morning breeze passed over the two sleeping forms on the alien
grass, and the sun began to rise over the horizon. B'Elanna and Seven faced each
other on their sides and held each other in a comforting embrace while they
slept. B'Elanna's face was safely snuggled into the top of Seven's bosom, while
her right leg had managed it's way in between Seven's thighs. </P>
<P>B'Elanna began to stir as the sunlight hit the side of her face. When she
opened her eyes she was staring directly at Seven's beautiful breasts. B'Elanna
pulled back in shock, attempting to extricate her leg in the process. "Ahhh!
What are you doing Seven?" </P>
<P>Seven awoke to a very embarrassed and blushing Chief Engineer. "I was
sleeping, now I am lying on my side." Seven rubbed her eyes, trying to get used
to the morning sunlight. In her alcove on Voyager she always awoke to a glowing
green room, now she awoke to a brilliant sun-soaked planet. </P>
<P>"No, I mean what were you doing to me?" B'Elanna asked not remembering the
events of last night. </P>
<P>"I do not recall doing anything to you Lt. Torres." Seven brushed herself off
while slowly getting up.</P>
<P>"Then what do you call having your arms draped around me like that?" B'Elanna
questioned.</P>
<P>"I was attempting to console you while you were having your paranoid
delusions last night, as well as providing you my body heat to keep you warm."
Seven stated as if it was obvious.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stood up from her kneeling position to match Seven's standing
position. "What?" B'Elanna said shocked and angry. "I was not having paranoid
delusions. And as far as keeping me warm goes, I don't need your help!" B'Elanna
turned and stalked off, but before she could make it very far, Seven's voice
pierced her core. </P>
<P>"Who is Claire?" Seven asked, ignoring the Engineer's current state of anger
and flight.</P>
<P>B'Elanna froze, suddenly taken over by fear. She slowly turned around. "Who?"
B'Elanna asked uneasily.</P>
<P>"Claire. You mentioned her last night during your delusions. I believe she
was a former lover of yours. Is that correct Lt. Torres?" Seven was the curious
Borg once again. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart stopped, she couldn't move. Thoughts were racing through her
mind at warp 10, she simply stood there not answering and not moving.</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres?"</P>
<P>Nothing.</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres?" Seven question again as she moved closer to the unmoving
Engineering. "Is there something wrong?" Seven closed the distance between
them.</P>
<P>"I…. I…. I…" Was all B'Elanna could get out. "I what?" Seven continued. "I…
I… think… we should… look for… Ensign Parker." B'Elanna just managed, as she
avoided the question. </P>
<P>"True, but you have yet to answer my question." Seven pushed.</P>
<P>"What question?" B'Elanna was beginning to regain her composure. </P>
<P>"Who is Claire and is she a former lover of yours? Was the question in
question." Seven responded.</P>
<P>"Who?" B'Elanna faked not understanding. Seven realized they were going in
circles and was getting frustrated.</P>
<P>"The woman you referred to in you paranoid delusions last night." Seven
pried. </P>
<P>"Oh, Claire. She was just someone I knew before, nothing important." B'Elanna
said casually. It pained B'Elanna to say that, but she wanted to end the Borg
interrogation as quickly as possible. </P>
<P>"She did not seem unimportant, in fact she seemed very important to you."
Seven was relentless, not knowing why she was so curious, but something inside
her wanted to know about this Claire. </P>
<P>"Well she was!" B'Elanna snapped. "Now, can we get on to looking for our
missing team member or do you want to tell Captain Janeway we lost someone."
B'Elanna was adamant and Seven knew it.</P>
<P>"Very well." Seven was surprised at the anger B'Elanna showed when she pushed
her for an answer. Not that she hadn't seen the Engineer go off before, but this
time was different. Seven had not intentionally tried to anger the Lieutenant.
She was simply curious as to whether or not B'Elanna had a female lover prior to
Tom Paris. </P>
<P>With the exchange over, the two picked up the tricorders and some fruit, then
headed out for the apple patch in silence.</P>
