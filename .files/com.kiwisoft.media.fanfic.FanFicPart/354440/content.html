<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 3: Revealed feelings -->

<p>Willow was sitting in front of her desk and was searching for some information about a new demon that seemed to be in town when Buffy came into their shared room. Willow turned around and faced the center of her world and almost choked when she saw Buffy. She was wearing her prom dress. The one Buffy had worn on that day in the gym while dancing with Angel. But this time it was only for Willow. Buffy came in moved over to Willow and offered her her hand.</p>
<p>"May I ask for this dance, my dear?"</p>
<p>Willow stood up looked at Buffy and started to dance with her. They danced slow to the music she was listening to. Then Buffy moved closer and brushed over Willow's so sweet lips. Willow returned the kiss and lost herself in it. She prayed that this moment would never end.</p>
<p>Then she woke up. A smile on her face but tears in her eyes she looked at the clock and then let her eyes sweep through her dorm room. Buffy was nowhere and she hadn't returned yet. Otherwise her clothes would either be on the floor or in the trash but they weren't there. Willow was getting worried.</p>
<p>"My god, it's much too late. Buffy should have been here over two hours ago."</p>
<p>Just then the door flew open and Buffy trembled in her clothes soaked in blood.</p>
<p>"God, Buffy what happened?"</p>
<p>"Um.. I'd say I had a collision with the evil side."</p>
<p>"Please Buffy, it's not the time for joking. Let me take a look at your wounds."</p>
<p>Buffy let herself be helped onto the bed and started to take some of the clothes off but had to stop that because of the pains that shot through her body with every singe move. In the meanwhile Willow got the first aid kit and called Giles -actually she just pushed a button on the emergency pager but that was actually the same- and then used the scissors to cut off Buffy's clothes to be able to aid her cuts.</p>
<p>"Ok, now tell me what had happened." Willow told Buffy.</p>
<p>She only sighed and then started to tell the story.</p>
<p>"I was just on my way back as I heard that scream from the woods. I started to run towards the sound and was suddenly on a clearing. There I saw something I never had seen before. A girl maybe 13 or 14 years old hanging in the air, seemingly by magic cause there was no rope there or anything, right over a blue fire that seemed to crawl up her legs and slowly eat her up. I started to run towards the girl to rescue her when I was suddenly hit by... Ouch that hurts..."</p>
<p>"Sorry"</p>
<p>"Well, as I was just telling, I was hit by something from the side. I was completely thrown out of balance and crashed into the grass, then I looked over to what had hit me and saw nothing. Then I got up and wanted to run to that girl when I suddenly ran into something and then I saw something. Well I thought that I had seen something cause it was kinda invisible. I saw some kind of distortion in the air and then I was hit again flying good ten feet back. Then I tried to hear it and could..." ...Buffy hissed... " ...and could say that something was there but I wasn't really sure what or where. So I tried to close my eyes and only rely on what I heard. And it worked. Well at least a little cause I was able to beat that whateveritwas up and then I heard it run away. By the time I was finished with that THING and opened my eyes again the clearing was completely empty. No girl, no fire, no screams or whimpers. It was completely empty as if there had never been anything there."</p>
<p>"Hmm... you say everything was gone and that thing was invisible?" Giles asked startling Buffy, who had thought she was still alone with Willow. After she had started to tell what happened she had closed her eyes and had concentrated on Willow's tender touch and how good it felt to be aided by her. She had used her warmth to forget the bruises and cuts and sores she had. And she was really surprised that Giles had made it to them so fast.</p>
<p>"Yeah that thing was invisible and as I left that clearing I really had the feeling that it was a trap and that I just surprised that demon enough to retreat and let me alone. I think that's the only reason why I'm still here, alive."</p>
<p>She looked into Willow's eyes and saw the worries in there and finally knew what that special secret was that she was holding. She smiled at her and let herself feel completely free and comfortable in Willow's arms.</p>
<p>"Well it seems that we now at least have a clue what demon this could be that is here now and I really hope that it is the only one but I think that we won't have so much luck this time. Willow you stay here and keep an eye over Buffy and Buffy you stay here. Don't go back out and try to kill that thing alone. I'll go to the library and start looking for any hints that may tell us what we have here and what we can do about it." he said taking he's glasses off and starting to rub his eyes.</p>
<p>"Ok, sure, no problem. I'll stay here with Will watching over me and you get the info. I need some rest anyway."</p>

<p>After Giles had left Buffy sat there looking at Willow almost staring at her. And she had a smile on her face that she only could have because she finally knew what was wrong with Willow. Well actually not wrong but different than in the past.</p>
<p>As Willow looked up from the cuts and bruises over Buffy's body, almost lost into the smoothness of her skin and admiring how beautiful even the bruises on Buffy's body were, and saw the smile and the look in Buffy's eyes she knew that she didn't have to worry about their friendship anymore. She saw that the old Buffy was back, the one she had fell in love to. But what then came shocked her more than anything else she had seen or heard before could ever have done.</p>
