<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 9-->
<p>"Are you nervous?" Brooke asked as she squeezed Sam's hand reassuringly.
After the chat they had when Brooke first walked into the kitchen they had
sat down and had a nice dinner.  Brooke had tried to put what was to come
afterwards into a place in the back of her head hardly used, and she assumed
that Sam had done the same thing because she knew that she wouldn't have
been able to function if she hadn't.  With the emotions and hormones that
had been flying around since they first got together, it was inevitable that
Brooke would have thought about what the night they actually made love would
be like, and she had, but now that it was upon her she found herself anxious
yet giddy which made her an all together jumpy package.</p>

<p>"Quite," Sam responded walking into the warmth of Brooke's body.  "Are you?"
  Sam knew how she was feeling, which was an interesting mix of terror,
excitement, and longing.  It wasn't that she wasn't sure if she was ready or
not, she knew that she was, she was certain that Brooke was the one that she
wanted to give herself to, that wasn't even a question.  Yet, she couldn't
deny the fact that she had never been in a situation even remotely like this
before, and she didn't know what to do.  Not only was she unsure about the
initiation procedure she also lacked experience in the actual love making
process.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled down at her, "Surely," she replied her breath coming out in a
slight shudder.  "I feel like all of my neurons are misfiring," she went on
quietly.  Sam could feel the blondes body shaking faintly as she spoke and
was oddly comforted by the knowledge that Brooke was feeling the same way
she was about what they were about to do.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to think that maybe I should have read Lily's pamphlet," the
brunette said smiling into the cheerleaders chest.  She could feel a chuckle
vibrate throughout Brooke's body before she felt a pair a lips press to the
side of her head.</p>

<p>"We don't have to do this," Brooke said softly a moment later.  "I'm not
asking that of you," she continued not wanting Sam to think that she was
pressuring her into anything just because she was 'supposedly' the more
experienced of the two.  The truth was that she was just as clueless as Sam
was, and she didn't necessarily think that was a bad thing.</p>

<p>"I know," Sam said seriously pulling back a little bit so that she could see
Brooke's eyes.  "On both counts," she went on.  "I never thought that you
were, and if I did it really wouldn't have made a difference anyway...in case
you hadn't notice I have a leaning towards tenacity."  Brooke  smiled in
response to the last part but didn't say anything.  "I *want* to be with
you," Sam went on, "if you..."</p>

<p>"No, I want," Brooke said interrupting before Sam could finish.</p>

<p>They stood there looking at each for a moment in silence, then Brooke
decided to take the first step and she leaned forward capturing Sam's lips.
The kiss was tentative at first, hesitant and shy, but after a moment they
moved towards each other their lips meeting each other with more command.
Brooke's hands made their way to Sam's hips as they explored each other
mouths, and as Sam turned her attention to Brooke's neck the blonde moaned
and began to move her hands underneath the brunette's shirt.</p>

<p>Brooke's hands slid up Sam's torso slowly, savoring the feel of her
girlfriend's skin.  After a moment Sam untangled her hands from Brooke's
hair and raised her hands above her head allowing Brooke slide of her shirt
off easily.  Once the garment was removed from Sam's body Brooke tossed in
carelessly into some corner of the room, her eyes remaining trained on Sam.</p>

<p>Sam watched Brooke watch her, her hair in disarray and her lips parted
sensuously.</p>

<p>"You're beautiful," Brooke whispered so softly it was almost inaudible.  Sam
felt a blush began to travel across her at Brooke's words and the intensity
of the cheerleaders stare, but she was distracted from her
self-consciousness when Brooke leaned in and captured her lips once more.</p>

<p>Sam's hands then made their way to Brooke's shirt shaking vaguely as they
began to undo the buttons.  Breaking the contact between their lips Brooke
moved her hands to cover Sam's, holding them until they stopped shaking.
Then with her hands still covering Sam's she began to undo the buttons of
her shirt, slowly exposing the swell of her breasts and then the porcelain
expanse of her abdomen.  When all of the buttons were undone she dropped her
hand from Sam's and allowed the brunette to trail her hands up her side
before brushing the shirt off of her shoulders.</p>

<p>As her shirt floated to the ground Brooke felt Sam's hands begin to move
down along her body once more, this time trailing downwards until they
reached the waist of her skirt.  A shiver ran through Brooke's body at the
contact and her breath contracted in her chest.  She returned her lips to
Sam's passionately capturing them, a fire burning deep within her.  She felt
as if she were being consumed alive.</p>

<hr size=2 color=#669966 width=400>

<p>Sam moaned softly at the first contact of their naked bodies as Brooke moved
beside her on the bed.  She felt as if she being consumed.  Everywhere
Brooke touched her, every place their bodies were in contact she felt fire.
As Brooke's hand trailed across her torso Sam felt herself raising into the
blonde's touch.  Silently begging her to continue.</p>

<hr size=2 color=#669966 width=400>

<p>Brooke pressed her lips to Sam's pulse point sucking on it as her hand
caressed the inside of Sam's thigh.  As her nails lightly ran across the
pale skin of Sam's leg Brooke pressed herself closer to Sam even though
there was no place left for her to go.  Sam arched up into her and blindly
sought out her lips which Brooke gladly gave over to her.</p>

<hr size=2 color=#669966 width=400>

<p>Slowly, tentatively Brooke ran her fingers through Sam's wetness, massaging
the lips with the tips of her fingers as their lips moved against each
other.  Sam had long since ceased speaking, merely moaning and burying her
head in Brooke's shoulder nipping at the cheerleaders porcelain skin as she
arched up into and against the other girls hand.</p>

<p>Brooke's hand continued it's exploration of Sam until she found that secret
site she had sought and entered her, feeling Sam's body tense momentarily
before then relaxing again as Brooke began to move her fingers.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Brooke asked softly as Sam's breath hitched and she
continued to move against her.  Sam's lips were slightly parted and her eyes
closed as Brooke spoke but upon hearing her lovers voice her eyes opened and
she stared into Brooke's with a look of awe.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam responded breathlessly as she raised a sweat covered hand to
brush a stray strand of hair out of Brooke's face.  "I..." but whatever she
was about to say was cut off as Brooke laid a finger over her lips quieting
her before replacing it with her lips.</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke whispered tenderly as she traced her thumb along Sam's
cheek before the brunette captured her lips once more and the movements of
the body beneath hers became more demanding.</p>

<hr size=2 color=#669966 width=400>

<p>The only thing that Brooke was aware of was the sound of Sam's voice-the
soft sounds she made in the back of her throat and her name rolling off of
her tongue dripping with desire-and the sound of her own breathing.  The
body beneath her was now moving in a frenzy, a blur of activity as Brooke
continued to move her hand in and out of Sam, her lips and her free hand
caressing and exploring every and all available area of skin.  And she felt
it.  Sam's body tensed and her breath hitched one last time before all that
she was aware of was the sound of her name reverberating around the room as
it was ripped from Sam's lips before she lost the ability to speak all
together.</p>

<p>Brooke held her as the brunettes body bucked against her until she began to
quiet down and still after that, whispering to her softly.</p>

<hr size=2 color=#669966 width=400>

<p>When Sam next opened her eyes the first thing that she saw was Brooke's face
looking down at her, a small, serene smile gracing her lips.</p>

<p>Brooke looked down into Sam's eyes as they opened; they looked almost gold
to her at the moment; they were sparkling as Sam smiled up at her.</p>

<p>"God, I love you so much," Brooke breathed out softly, her eyes boring into
Sam's intensely.  She felt this incredible swell of emotion within her, it
swept over her like the tide or the wind leaving no part of her untouched.
She was overcome, she was conquered, and almost as soon as the last syllable
left her mouth she leaned down bringing their lips together once more in a
tender, loving kiss as a single tear streaked down her face.</p>
