<!-- What Ever Happened To \ Part One -->

<p>"What ever happened to what's-her-name?" Holly inquired, trying to sound casual.</p>
		<p>"I don't know. What's her name?" Selma asked as she sipped her soda.</p>
		<p>"You know, that really tall girl who use to sit behind you in chemistry," Holly continued as she tried to look as if the girl's name had escaped her. </p>
		<p>"Oh, you mean Whitney." The dark woman smiled devilishly. "I wouldn't think that you'd have forgotten her name."</p>
		<p>"What are you implying?" the blonde scoffed in response.</p>
		<p>"Please! You would practically drool every time you saw her," Selma teased. "You and every guy in school."</p>
		<p>"I did not," Holly protested as she tossed a rolled up napkin at her old friend.</p>
		<p>"You did." Selma laughed. "It was embarrassing. I swear I don't know why it took you so long to figure out that you were gay." Selma smirked. </p>
		<p>Holly snorted indignantly at her old friend. "I forgot what a pain in the ass you are." She wagged her finger as she glared at the other woman. </p>
		<p>"Play nice or I won't tell you about Whitney," Selma said dryly as she wiggled her eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"So you know then," Holly pried. "Is she coming to the reunion? Not that I care."</p>
		<p>"Uh huh," Selma sighed as she stuck her tongue in her cheek. "Then why did you ask?"</p>
		<p>"Just trying to catch up on what's happened with everyone," Holly lied.</p>
		<p>"She didn't hang around with us," Selma pointed out. "What makes you think that I'd know anything?"</p>
		<p>"Because you know everything about everybody." Holly smirked. "You always did. What was it Joan use to call you?" She thought for a moment. "Five-O." She laughed at the memory.</p>
		<p>"Yeah well, that was fifteen years ago." Selma winced slightly. "My God, fifteen years. I can't believe it."</p>
		<p>"I know," Holly agreed. "I'm glad I came back for this one. I still can't believe they're tearing down the old high school."</p>
		<p>"Well at least it got everyone to come back," Selma stated happily. "The school is really run down. The heating is shot and the foundation is shaky. I tell you, every time I'd have to teach a class in there I was afraid the building was going to collapse."</p>
		<p>"I still can't believe you're a teacher." Holly laughed as she ran her fingers through her short blonde hair. </p>
		<p>"Why not?" Selma protested. </p>
		<p>"I don't know. Maybe because I was the one who held your hair back the first time you got sick from drinking," Holly explained. "Or that we got busted for smoking in the girls' bathroom. Or the time you broke into the guys' locker room."</p>
		<p>"Stop," Selma squealed. "Hey, I have a reputation to maintain here. I wouldn't want my deep dark secrets getting out. I'm a respected member of the community now, complete with a husband and kids."</p>
		<p>"A real pillar of the community." Holly laughed in amazement. "Let's see how much can I tarnish your reputation once I get you start on a few kamikazes."</p>
		<p>"Ah, none for me." Selma winced as she shifted uncomfortably.</p>
		<p>"Uh huh," Holly said carefully as she wondered if her suspicions were correct. "Quit drinking?"</p>
		<p>"Well . . . yeah . . . kind of," Selma confessed shyly.</p>
		<p>Holly smiled. She knew her friend didn't have a substance abuse problem. And while she respected a person's choice not to drink, she suspected that there was another reason. "So for how long?" Holly prodded. "Nine months?" she added with a twinkle in her green eyes.</p>
		<p>"How did you know?" Selma beamed.</p>
		<p>"Lucky guess," Holly explained. "You just look . . . oh I don't know. Another baby." She sighed happily as she clutched her chest.</p>
		<p>"We are thrilled," Selma confessed. "But you can't tell anyone."</p>
		<p>"Rats." Holly pouted.</p>
		<p>"It's too soon," Selma explained seriously. "You never know."</p>
		<p>"I understand," Holly said softly as she clutched her old friend's hand. "It's going to be hard, knowing this and not being able to tell anyone. I live to gossip."</p>
		<p>"Some things never change," Selma concurred.</p>
		<p>"So how's life in the big city?" Selma inquired. "You seemed to take the break up with Sherri pretty hard."</p>
		<p>"It was a mess." Holly sighed disgustedly. "Deep down I think I knew she was running around. Of course, I never suspected it was with a guy. I felt as if my whole world had collapsed around me. I'm better now. I've even started dating again."</p>
		<p>"I was really worried about you," Selma stated sincerely.</p>
		<p>"It still hurts," Holly admitted. "But I'm better off without her. I can see that now. Of course those first few months, I was a mess. I just threw myself into my work. The up side is that I got a promotion."</p>
		<p>"Alright," Selma said with a smile. </p>
		<p>"I'm the head of my department now." Holly smirked, knowing it had really frosted Sherri's cookies when she heard.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe the little blonde who sat next to me in kindergarten and ate paste is a big corporate executive," Selma taunted her. Holly buried her face in her hands and moaned. "Don't worry, sweetie. You keep my secret and I won't tell a soul about your dietary peculiarities. But if anyone pats my stomach at the reunion . . ."</p>
		<p>"I promise. Not a word," Holly blurted out as she jerked up her head. "So who's going to be there tomorrow?"</p>
		<p>"Well, since I'm on the committee I can tell you that everyone from our old gang will be there," Selma answered proudly. </p>
		<p>"Everyone?" Holly grimaced.</p>
		<p>"What?" Selma asked in confusion.</p>
		<p>"Selma, not everyone is as understanding as you are," Holly explained. "A lot of people I thought were my friends haven't spoken to me since I came out. Bobby even sent me hate mail for awhile."</p>
		<p>"He's a dufus," Selma snarled. "The guy thought you were going to get married when you were fourteen." Holly started to frown. "Hey, don't worry about it. If anyone has a problem with you, they can just kiss my Mexican ass. I'm serious. I know what's it like. I was the only kid whose parents spoke Spanish. You were the first one to be my friend and not care. So if they don't like it, they can just . . ."</p>
		<p>"Eat paste?" Holly suggested playfully.</p>
		<p>"Damn right," Selma confirmed. "Speaking of close-minded knot heads, are you going to see your parents while you're in town?"</p>
		<p>"No." Holly shivered at the thought. "I still remember my mother wailing that ?if only I hadn't gone away to college' or that they shouldn't have allowed me to play sports."</p>
		<p>"I still think you were adopted." Selma moaned. "There's no way that those are your real parents."</p>
		<p>"New subject please," Holly said as her body tensed. "I will not have them spoil my vacation."</p>
		<p>"Alright, so do you want to know who else is coming to the reunion?" Selma taunted her. Holly's brow crinkled slightly as she wondered just where this conversation was heading. "Whitney," Selma drew out the name as she smiled wickedly.</p>
		<p>"Really." Holly smiled. "Oh my. I had such a crush on her," Holly finally admitted.</p>
		<p>"I know," Selma responded in a cocky tone. "I knew then. I was just waiting for you to buy a clue."</p>
		<p>"I don't like that look in your eyes," Holly cautioned her. "It was fifteen years ago and she never knew I existed. Plus, she's probably straighter than you are."</p>
		<p>"Well, I'll tell you what I know if you buy me dessert," Selma tormented her.</p>
		<p>"Waitress," Holly called out.</p>
		<p>Holly impatiently tapped her fingers on the table as her old friend read the dessert menu twice before selecting a slice of double chocolate layer cake with a scoop of ice cream. Holly ordered another coffee. "Spill it," Holly demanded after the waitress departed.</p>
		<p>"Okay. Don't get your jammies in a bunch." Selma groaned as she rolled her eyes. "She's a lawyer."</p>
		<p>The waitress chose that moment to return with their orders. "Oh, this looks so good," Selma cooed as she began to dig in. Holly looked on in horror. "What?" Selma asked between mouthfuls. "I'm eating for two." Holly just looked at her in disbelief. "Cravings?" Selma added hopefully.</p>
		<p>"Do you know how many hours I would have to spend at the gym after eating something like that?" Holly said as she shook her head in disbelief.</p>
		<p>"You have my sympathy." Selma smirked.</p>
		<p>"Okay, now that your sweet tooth is being satisfied . . . ," Holly urged her on, ". . . tell me about the tall, dark, blue-eyed wonder I used to fantasize about as a teenager."</p>
		<p>"She's a lawyer," Selma repeated.</p>
		<p>"You said that," Holly fumed.</p>
		<p>"She works for the public defender's office in Boston," Selma expanded. "So you two live in the same city," Selma noted. </p>
		<p>"Really?" Holly responded brightly. Her smile quickly vanished. "That still doesn't mean anything."</p>
		<p>"She does volunteer work for LAMBDA." Selma smirked confidently. </p>
		<p>"Okay, a legal non-profit group that works to fight hate crimes," Holly noted. "But you do work for them as well," Holly pointed out.</p>
		<p>"She also volunteers for BAGLY," Selma added confidently.</p>
		<p>"The Boston Alliance for Gay and Lesbian Youth." Holly smiled brightly. "Wow, that's incredible. I feel like a slug."</p>
		<p>"Well, don't put yourself down," Selma interjected. "We do what we can. Now the important thing to remember is that . . . Whitney is a big lesbian. Try to focus here."</p>
		<p>"Okay. . . okay." Holly laughed. "Still, she's probably in a relationship."</p>
		<p>"You are such a kill joy." Selma groaned. "She's attending the reunion alone."</p>
		<p>"Really?" Holly perked up. "Interesting."</p>
		<p>"She's also staying in the same hotel that you are," Selma added in a singsong voice.</p>
		<p>"Well, that's not surprising," Holly argued. "That's where the reunion's being held."</p>
		<p>"So when you see her, are you going to worship her from a far?" Selma inquired. "Or take a chance and jump her bones?" she added eagerly.</p>
		<p>"There's something wrong with you." Holly narrowed her eyes. "Selma, why are you so excited about this? The woman didn't know my name fifteen years ago. What makes you think she'd be interested in me now?"</p>
		<p>"I'm just a hopeless romantic," Selma offered. Holly had the nagging feeling that there was something Selma wasn't telling her.</p>
		<p>The two continued to chat until it was time for Selma to leave. Holly decided to take a walk around her hometown. The cool crisp autumn air surrounded her as she walked. Not much had changed over the years. Not really surprising. It was a small town that had always resisted change. That was one of the reasons that Holly needed to leave. She found herself standing on the corner of her old street, debating if she should at least try to talk to her parents. </p>
		<p>She shivered at the thought of having yet another fight with them. Tomorrow was going to be hard enough with people treating her differently. She pulled her coat tightly around her body before taking one last look down the familiar street. She turned away and began the walk back to her hotel.</p>
