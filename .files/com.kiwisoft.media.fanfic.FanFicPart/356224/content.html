<!-- Listen to Your Heart \ Chapter VI -->

<p>I did it.</p>
<p>I took my chance.</p>
<p>I was aware of the consequences.</p>
<p>But I was not prepared.</p>
<p>Because her amnesia was most likely caused by an emotional trauma I knew that the chances to ... 'bring her back' - as Kathryn put it - , never had been better than tonight.</p>
<p>She called out to me from behind the barrier. Never was she so close.</p>
<p>And never were we so close.<br>This was my chance to break through the block by pushing her over the edge. And to tell her how I feel at the same time.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>My medical research indicated a high probability that she would lose consciousness if the memory returned suddenly and all at once.</p>
<p>I watched her intently to not miss the right moment. I watched her reliving scenes from her memory. The pain that was evident on her face was also present in my chest.</p>
<p>When she finally lost consciousness and all her muscles relaxed she seemed so vulnerable. But her unmoving body also radiated ... strength.</p>
<p>I caught her easily and bedded her down on the couch in her quarters, but if she does not wake up soon I will have to transport her to sickbay.</p>
<p>I am worried. I am sure that she will wake up. But I don't know what to expect once she does.</p>
<p>I look at her peaceful face. I hold her hand to my heart and let the fingers of my other hand travel over her flushed cheek. The colour of her lips is a deep red. I hope that I will never lose the precious memory of that kiss.</p>
<p>She stirs and groans softly before she opens her eyes. My heart stops.</p>
<p>I am unsure as to what to do. I want to look away, break all contact, stand up and call to sickbay.</p>
<p>Momentarily I lose control over my motor functions. I know that I have been called icy. Now I am truly frozen.</p>
<p>Her eyes are dilated and glassy. Like they had been so often, back then, in engineering, when she was furious.</p>
<p>Her hand unwinds from my grasp. She pulls it away as if to strike out. In this moment I am sure that I had payed the full price.</p>
<p>"Seven."</p>
<p>It's a hoarse whisper and I am unable to determine an underlying emotion.</p>
<p>But her hand, the one I held tightly only moments ago, approaches my head and...</p>
<br>...cups my cheek.
<br>I am... confused.
<br>Did she not... ?
<p>" *Seven*... ?"</p>
<p>"B-B'Elanna?" Omega, what have I done?</p>
<p>"Seven, what are you doing ... ?" She touches her lips and now I'm sure she still tastes the blood.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I ... " I'm not sure what to tell her. I am not sorry. I believe I love her, but still I don't know...</p>
<p>"Why? Seven, *why* ? - Oooh... uhh, this head is gonna kill me... " She closes her eyes. I sense her absence, the - /my/ loss.</p>
<p>"I hope not." My voice almost fails me. "I apologize. I should have transferred you to sickbay immediately."</p>
<p>The movement that is meant to activate the communicator equals the attempt to re-settle my heart beat.</p>
<p>"Seven of Nine to sickbay. Prepare for incomming patient."</p>
<p>"Seven? What happened, who is the patient... ?" The doctor annoys me. But I find myself relieved to have the opportunity to defer the inevitable conversation with B'El- the Lieutenant.</p>
<p>"Doctor. The patient is Lieutenant Torres. Seven out."</p>
<p>Despite all preparation and research I will need some time to... adapt.</p>
<p>"Computer, site-to-site transport to sickbay. Lock on to..."</p>
<p>"Computer - belay that order..."</p>
<p>The harsh tone tells me more then I wish to know in this moment. For the benefit of my continued existence I take a deep breath even as my heart stops.</p>
<blockquote> what's love but a word <br>what's your name but a word <br>what's my world but two words</blockquote>
<p>"Lieutenant?"</p>
<p>"Seven. Uhm, will you come with me... -please?"</p>
<p>I have to be strong and remind myself that this is not ... my ... B'Elanna.</p>
<p>Then I look at her. And I see her eyes.</p>
<p>Still ...</p>
<p>"Computer, site to site transport... two to sickbay."</p>
