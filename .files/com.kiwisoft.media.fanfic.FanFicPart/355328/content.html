<!-- High School Hell \ Breaking Down The Walls -->

<p>Brooke walked into Sam's room and found her love curled up facing the window. Even facing away, Sam looked broken, defeated. Brooke's heart went out to her and she cursed the cosmic masses that kept putting Sam through such punishment. </p>
<p>"Sam, we need to talk," she said, breaking the eerie stillness of the room. Sam rolled over slightly but didn't face Brooke just yet. </p>
<p>"Go away, please," Sam begged. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"Nope, can't get rid of me that easily," she declared confidently. </p>
<p>"I don't want you here," Sam snapped. </p>
<p>"Liar," Brooke accused. Sam glared for a second before looking away again. </p>
<p>"I don't," she insisted hotly. "I don't want you anywhere near me." </p>
<p>"Tough because I'm not giving up that easily," Brooke told her. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Suit yourself but I all ready have." The words chilled Brooke straight through. She approached the bed. </p>
<p>"What?" she whispered. Sam turned slightly to face her and Brooke could see the empty look Nic had warned her about in Sam's eyes. Sam had indeed given up. Brooke shivered at the sight. </p>
<p>"I give, I surrender, I resign, I yield, I submit, I acquiesce," Sam started. </p>
<p>"I get the point," Brooke sighed. "Now explain to me what that means." </p>
<p>"I'm tired of fighting all the time. I'm tired of explaining myself over and over to people whose business it never was to begin with. I'm tired of watching you hurt because of it so I'm putting an end to it now. I'm giving you your out, Brooke. Take it, no hard feelings," Sam explained. Brooke looked at her dumbstruck. </p>
<p>"Do I mean that little to you?" she asked quietly. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, you mean that MUCH to me. I'm letting you go because it's the right thing for you, Brooke, I'm not." Brooke rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"And you came to this brilliant deduction when?"</p>
<p>"While I was lying on the grass in agony. I realized that I never want you to experience that, Brooke. This has to stop. And the only way to spare you that kind of pain is to end this now before we get in any deeper," Sam said sadly. Brooke glared at her angrily. </p>
<p>"How deep is too deep, Sam? Huh? Tell me. Because honestly, I can't imagine my life without you in it," she started. </p>
<p>"We'll still be stepsisters and I hope friends," Sam broke in.</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant, Sammy and you know it," Brooke snapped. "I can't imagine my life without you beside me to live it. When I wake up in the morning, yours is the first face I want to see. When I go to bed at night, yours is the last face I want to see. There is no one else I ever want to make love to or have make love to me." </p>
<p>"Brooke, just stop it," Sam said. </p>
<p>"No, you said your piece and now I'll say mine. When you threw me out of here, I felt like someone crushed my soul, Sam. I thought I was going to die it hurt so bad to be turned away by you," she was starting to cry and was disturbed by the fact that Sam seemed uneffected. </p>
<p>"How can you just shut off your emotions like this, Sam?" she asked. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Practice," she answered boredly. </p>
<p>"Old habits," Brooke realized. "I thought we broke you of this one." Sam shrugged again. Brooke tried another method of reaching her. "What if I stopped eating again?" Sam stared at her in horror. (Well, at least it's a reaction) Brooke thought. </p>
<p>"You wouldn't," she claimed. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"If you can revert to your old defense mechanisms, why can't I?" </p>
<p>"Mine won't kill me," Sam shot back. </p>
<p>"I wouldn't be so sure," Brooke muttered but Sam heard her.</p>
<p>"SO FUCKING WHAT?" Sam screamed, startling Brooke with the power behind it. Brooke looked at her in surprise as she finally realized what was wrong with Sam. </p>
<p>"Do you wish that you were dead?" she asked disbelieving.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you?" Sam retorted angrily. "I am so sick and tired of all this crap! First, I get splattered on the asphalt like a three-legged raccoon, end up paralyzed and aphasic, recover and begin a relationship with my former rival and stepsister, the only bright part of that experience."</p>
<p>"Then we come `out' to the people in our lives only to have some of them react horribly and lose friends and I almost lose the love of my life to her own inner demons because of my own arrogance. But we get past that and our own nightmares only to start at square one because of some religious zealot and a school-wide case of raging homophobia!" </p>
<p>"Any or all of it I could probably deal with on its own but then I hear my love's own voice saying that she only loves me out of pity and for the attention that it gets her. Pardon me for wanting to push the button on my morphine drip a few times too many," Sam finished. Brooke shook her head in shock. </p>
<p>"You know that tape was fake," she pointed out.</p>
<p>"Well, duh! From the second it started. But it didn't make hearing it hurt any less because of the possibility, Brooke. We have to stop now, while we still can." </p>
<p>"I can't," Brooke said evenly. Sam stared at her with her mouth open. </p>
<p>"Excuse me? You're 17 years old, you don't form life long attachments at 17," Sam informed her. </p>
<p>"I have," Brooke countered. "I'm not you, Sam, I can't just shut my emotions off. I love you, inside and out and I'm not just going to stop because you tell me to." Sam looked away. </p>
<p>"I hope you like it on that one-way road, Brooke, cuz that's where you're going to find yourself," Brooke slapped the side of Sam's face she could reach. Sam looked at her in shock. </p>
<p>"Snap out of it, Sam. This self-pity trip is getting tiresome," Brooke growled. </p>
<p>"Tell me something, Brooke," Sam ground out through clenched teeth and Brooke knew she was getting to the heart of the matter. "How much am I supposed to take? Huh? When do I get to say `enough'? When do I get to put my foot down and say `no more'?" </p>
<p>"I have taken everything thrown at me in stride, or at least the best that I can but no matter what I do I can't seem to catch a break. If I turn left, I should have gone right. Nothing ends up the way it should. The only thing that's ended up halfway decent is you and even that's screwed up now."</p>
<p>"You did that to yourself," Brooke pointed out to her. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm doing what's right," she told Brooke. "You shouldn't be with me, Brooke. You should be with a guy who can give you the traditional picture. The little house with the white picket fence, the dog and the two point five kids playing in the backyard. Without the strife and agony or the uphill battles and condescending looks or bigotry. I can't give you any of that, Brooke. I want what's best for you and that's not me," now Sam was starting to cry. Brooke moved to hold her but Sam pulled away. </p>
<p>"Why are you making this difficult?" Sam asked. "I'm trying to do the right thing for you and you're making it hard. You're being impossible."</p>
<p>"Me? You're the one not making any sense. I love you, not some phantom guy and what could be. Screw the traditional picture, Sammy. We can have our own version someday I just know it. Complete with the little house with the white picket fence, the dog and the two point five kids playing in the backyard. I don't want any of those things unless you're in the picture too, Sam."</p>
<p>"I'm so tired, Brooke," Sam lamented. Brooke was worried. They'd hit Sam's breaking point hard and she wasn't sure what to do. She thought back and heard her father's words from that night in the kitchen. </p>
<p>"What did she do when you wouldn't take help after she left?" </p>
<p>"She waited me out, was patient and loving but firm until I listened. She let me know that she wasn't letting me go and that she loved me," she'd responded. </p>
<p>"I think you have your answer. Remember that when the road gets rocky, Brooke. It probably won't be easy, we both know how stubborn the girl can be. Stand by her, Brooke and hold on to her. If you do that, then she'll have no choice but to let you help." </p>
<p>"I love you, Sam," she said firmly. "Despite everything you've said recently. And I'm not letting you go. Not now, not ever. It's going to take a lot more than a religious nutcase, a hockey stick and your twisted logic to get rid of me. So get used to me being here whether you want me here or not. I love you," she repeated. </p>
<p>"Brooke, please," Sam begged, her composure cracking.</p>
<p>"No, and I'm not going to let you kill yourself by shutting down either. You tried that once and I pulled you out and I'll do it again. I'm here to stay, Sammy. I know you love me, even if you don't say it." </p>
<p>"This is too hard," Sam complained quietly. </p>
<p>"The things in life worth having are never easy, Sammy," Brooke whispered. "But you're worth having, worth fighting for even if I have to fight your own stubborn pride." </p>
<p>"Please leave me, I'm trying to do the right thing," Sam cried. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Tell me you don't love me and I'll leave. No more arguments," Brooke challenged. Sam stared at her in shock. Brooke looked at her intently, silently daring her to say it. </p>
<p>"Say it, Sam. If you really want me out of your life, tell me you don't love me," she repeated praying Sam wouldn't. </p>
<p>"I do love you," Sam sobbed, unable to stop herself. She wanted to do what was right and she thought that letting Brooke go and have a normal life was it. But Brooke didn't want that, she wanted her and now Sam didn't know what to do. So she cried, out of relief and fear. Brooke pulled Sam to her and Sam let her, collapsing into the embrace. </p>
<p>"I'm so sorry," she sobbed into Brooke's shoulder. Brooke stroked Sam's hair and whispered calmly to her. </p>
<p>"I know, I am too. We'll get through this, Sammy. I promise."</p>
<p>"How?" Sam asked. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno. Same way we always do, Sammy. Together, one day at a time." </p>
<p>"But what if it's not enough this time?" For that, Brooke really didn't have an answer. </p>
<p>"It has to be, Sammy, because I'm never letting you go," was the best she could offer. </p>
