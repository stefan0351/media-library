<!-- Sappho's Spell \ Story -->

<p>Buffy was exercising when Willow came into their shared dorm room. She had
music playing, full blare, and it was all Willow could do to keep from
walking back out. “Hey!” She called out, over the blaring of the CD
player. “Can I turn this down?”</p>
<p>Buffy, finally noticing Willow standing there, nodded her head as she
continued her fighting moves. Willow noticed a package wrapped in brown
paper on her bed and walked over to it. “Hey, what’s this?” Willow asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t know.” Buffy grunted. “It came for you today.” Sweat was pouring
off of the Slayer’s face and Willow tried not to notice how beautiful she
was. Buffy wiped her face with
the towel she kept handy for just an occasion, and went to sit on her bed.
“Are you going to open it, or just look at it for the rest of the night?”
Buffy asked, impatient to see what it was. Her
curiosity had been eating at her all through her work out, and now she
couldn’t wait for Willow to tear into the package.</p>
<p>Willow spared her best friend an appraising look, then smirked at her.
“Dying of curiosity, aren’t you?” She asked. She knew her friend so well.</p>
<p>“Will! Would you just open it?!” Buffy asked, exasperated. Though her
excited smile took the sting out of her words.</p>
<p>Willow chuckled, then opened the package, finding a dusty old tome inside.
“Oh!” Willow gasped, excited. “It’s the spell book my friend said he was
going to send me.” Willow couldn’t wait to start shuffling through the
pages, looking for interesting spells that she wanted to try.</p>
<p>“That’s great, Will.” Buffy said, smiling. Now that her curiosity was
sated she could get back to her exercising. “Have fun.” She murmured,
knowing Willow probably wouldn’t poke
her head out of the book for a couple of hours at least.</p>
<p>“Uh huh.” Willow muttered, already lost in reading the spells in the book.
 Buffy went over the closet door and started doing chin-ups on the frame.
‘She gets so excited over those
spells.’ Buffy thought, shaking her head and chuckling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Willow was turning the pages of the book, reading the names of
the spells on each one when one of them caught her eye. It was titled,
‘True Love’s Touch.’ and the witch that had written the spell had signed her
name underneath the title along with a dedication. ‘Sappho’, Willow thought
to herself. ‘Now there’s an unusual name.’ She vaguely remembered a lesson
in a history class she had taken about a poet in Ancient Greece with the
name of Sappho, but she didn’t remember all that had been said about her.
She had been paying too much attention to Xander and Buffy, who had been
goofing off that day because they were bored. But it struck her
odd that a witch had the same name of the ancient poet, and it filled her
with curiosity to see what the spell was about. But first she read the
Dedication. Twice.</p>
<p>~To the Warrior and follower, may your threads never be cut.

<p>Willow thought the Dedication was rather odd, and she didn’t know what it
meant, but it struck her curiosity, so she decided to read the spell to see
if she could decipher the meaning behind the words. By the time she
finished the page the spell was cast.</p>
<p>“Buffy.” Buffy heard her name being said, while she was in the middle of
pulling her chin over the door, and she paused confused. She didn’t think
Willow would be done reading so
quickly, and she turned her head a fraction of an inch to see if she could
locate her friend out of the corner of her eye. Not being able to locate
her, Buffy sighed and dropped to the floor, before
she turned around to look at Willow. Willow had the strangest look on her
face, Buffy noticed, and it made her pause before her concern took over.
“Hey, are you okay? You look a little...”
She stopped, trying to find the right word to describe the way her best
friend was looking at her.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” Willow said smiling, her eyes glowing dangerously. “Why do
you ask?” She asked, as she inched closer to her friend, who was standing
stock still beside the closet door.</p>
<p>Buffy gulped, and tried to fight down this irrational urge to run she was
having. This was Willow. Her best friend. Not some hungry beast who was
about to devour her. Although....at the
moment, Willow did have a faint resemblance to a lion, a tiger, or a
bear...oh my. Buffy backed up with each step that Willow advanced until she
found herself against the wall, looking anxiously
for any avenue of escape.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Willow asked, her eyebrows raising innocently, although
her bright green eyes told a different story. “Is the big bad slayer scared
of itty, bitty, little me?” A wicked smile played around the corners of
Willow’s mouth as the amusement of stalking the slayer played across her
face.</p>
<p>Buffy gulped...hard. “Um, Of course not. I was just wondering what spell
you must have been reading to work yourself up like this.” Buffy said,
trying to find the reason behind her
friend’s strange behavior.</p>
<p>“I’m not worked up.” Willow denied innocently, as she was a hair’s breadth
away from the Slayer. “Yet.” Willow whispered, before lunging forward and
seizing control of Buffy’s mouth with her own. Buffy whimpered as she found
herself pushed back into the wall and her mouth being completely ravished by
her best friend. Buffy tried hard to protest, but it was pretty hard to
speak with her best friend’s tongue in her mouth. All she could make out
were at first
moans of surprise and protest which turned after a short while into
unwilling moans of pleasure. She tried to control the animal attraction that
was breaking down every door in her mind as it tried
to get her to take matters into her own hands. She rationally tried to
explain to the animal that this was her best friend whose lips were
devouring and nibbling on hers, and whose hands were....never mind, don’t go
there, she warned her mind as her body felt exactly where Willow’s hands
were. Her friend obviously was under a spell of some kind and had no idea
what she was doing. And if she let her desire get the better of her, she
was sure she’d regret it in the morning. She was about to rationally and
sanely restrain Willow, when Willow not so innocently tweaked one of her
nipples while simultaneously rubbing her hip across the crotch of the
slayer’s shorts, and she nipped at the Slayer’s ear.</p>
<p>“Oh God!” Buffy cried an urgent prayer as her animal broke free of it’s
cage and went roaring through her body, sending every fiber of her being
into an instant rage of desire. “God.”
She got out again through gritted teeth, as she grabbed a hold of her
friend’s body and pulled her to her, feeling every inch of her body pressed
tightly against her. “Will.” Buffy breathed hotly, as
she ran her hands up and down her friend’s body, feeling every soft curve.
Willow whimpered helplessly, as she felt Buffy taking over her role of
control. She wanted Buffy to take control of
her. Needed it as if her life depended on it.</p>
<p>Buffy felt the urgency in her friend, and with negligent strength, picked
up her friend carrying her to the nearby bed. She placed Willow on the bed,
then looked down at her with glowing eyes, seeing the returning heat in
Willow’s gaze as Buffy quickly shed her shorts and T-shirt nearly tearing
them in the process. She felt Willow’s appreciative stare as she shed her
clothes, then returned the look when she removed Willow’s shirt and skirt,
as well as everything underneath. “You’re so beautiful.” Buffy breathed,
staring at Willow’s newly revealed body. Willow allowed her to look her
fill, only starting to whimper when Buffy stood there too long.</p>
<p>Buffy saw the need in her friend’s eyes, and climbed slowly onto the bed,
settling her weight carefully on top of her friend. Her eyes closed at the
blissful merging of soft skin, and she
forgot to breathe for a second as she took the sensation in. She felt
Willow’s hands starting to wander across her back and opened her eyes to
look into the desire filled green eyes below her. “I love you.” Buffy
whispered, lowering her head to bring their lips together, the heat in their
kiss nearly searing her nerve endings. Buffy sank into the passion the kiss
evoked, feeling Willow’s
hands everywhere. She took the kiss downward, spreading kisses over
Willow’s chin and neck, then further down into the V of Willow’s throat,
sucking and nibbling on the tender skin until it
formed a satisfying mark.</p>
<p>Willow was mindless with passion, wriggling under the sensations that Buffy
evoked with her mouth and hands. She wrapped her legs around the swaying
Slayer’s hips, anchoring herself
to the passionate Slayer as she took them both for a ride.</p>
<p>Buffy could feel her temperature rising, her body changing as something
strange and mysterious built up inside of her. Buffy had made love before,
but it had never felt as all consuming and powerful as this did. The very
feel of Willow underneath her took her to places she had never known, and
sent her desire soaring to an all time high. Buffy was about to go over the
edge, when all of her nerve endings went into sudden shock as she was hit
with what felt like a lightning bolt of pleasure, starting at the base of
her spine and searing outward to every limb. “Willow!” Buffy screamed, as
she felt the excess electricity swimming through her blood stream
and electrifying every ion and particle. It dispersed throughout every part
of her body, then gathered again in her center, building up slowly to full
force. Buffy felt the pleasure build until
she thought she would go insane from the sheer force of it. Until it
finally exploded from Buffy’s body, like a bullet from a gun, and entered
Willow’s body by the merging of their thrusting hips.
They both cried out at the sensation, Willow’s eyes nearly rolling up into
the top of her head at the intensity of the sensation. Like it had in
Buffy’s body, it dispersed into every region of Willow’s
body, but unlike in the Slayer’s body, it merged with every cell of the
Wicca’s being, before drawing all of it’s energy into her center. Instead
of building again, it stayed in Willow’s center
with a dull ache, until Buffy’s thrusting body forced them both over the
edge and it mingled with their converging essences. It quietly settled into
the center of Willow’s core as they both passed
out from the mind blowing orgasm.</p>
<p>Sunlight played across the bed, sneaking across two forms that lay very
still, and very close. It slipped up one of their faces, to play across the
person’s freckled cheeks and nose
coming to rest on their eyelids. Green eyes blinked open, the ray of sun
making them appear dazzling in the early morning light if anyone had been
awake to see them, and a hand brushed red
hair out of her eyes. The sun played havoc on her senses, and she blinked
away a wave of pain and dizziness. “Oh, my head.” Willow groaned, shutting
her eyes tight. If she had ever had a
hangover she supposed this is how it would feel. Willow gradually became
aware of things that were out of the usual order when she woke up in the
morning. For one, the wall that she usually faced when she lay in bed was
too close. She could feel that she was naked under the covers, she usually
wore a nightgown to bed. And then, there was the little matter of the arm
that was thrown around her side and the hand that was lightly resting on her
chest. She had no idea who the arm belonged to, and no memory of how she
wound up in bed with the person. The last thing she remembered was coming
back to the dorm room after classes and finding the spell book. Everything
after that was a total blank, though she suspected that things probably had
gotten a little interesting after that, seeing as how she had ended up in
bed with somebody.</p>
<p>She looked down at the hand on her chest, startled to notice that it looked
kind of familiar. A vague picture of a person was starting to form in her
mind when she heard the person moan in
their sleep, and felt the person shift more tightly around her. The picture
in her mind cleared up instantly into the face of her best friend, Buffy
Summers. OhmygodwhathaveIdone? Willow had
time to think to herself, before she heard Buffy murmuring again, starting
to wake up. She forced herself not to panic as she felt the hand on her
chest starting to move pulling her closer into a
tighter embrace.</p>
<p>Buffy awoke gradually, her senses coming one at a time. At first all she
could do was feel. She felt her nakedness pressed up against Willow’s back,
her arm draped around Willow’s side, gently resting on Willow’s soft skin.
She felt Willow’s hair against her face where she had rested her head
against the back of Willow’s neck. Then she heard Willow’s breaths going in
and out, a comforting sound in the early morning hour. She smelled the
fresh scent of Willow’s shampoo, mixed with the subtle aroma of the love
they had made. It brought back pleasant memories of last night, and a smile
graced Buffy’s lips before she opened her eyes, her arms
tightening her hold on her new lover.</p>
<p>“Mmmm, morning.” Buffy sighed, kissing the back of Willow’s neck. Willow
stared at the wall, her eyes wide, not knowing quite what to do. Obviously,
her suspicions had been correct, but how did she go about telling Buffy that
she had no memory of what happened last night?</p>
<p>Not receiving an answer, Buffy at first thought that Willow was asleep.
But then she noticed that Willow’s body was too tense to be asleep. “Will?
Are you awake?” Buffy asked in a whisper. She didn’t want to wake her if
she really was asleep. She heard Willow sigh deeply, but she didn’t turn
around and she seemed to get more tense if that were possible. “Are you
Ok?” Buffy asked, a slight quiver of trepidation in her voice. She had a
slew of bad morning after experiences. She really didn’t want this morning
to be another one. She hoped that Willow would be okay with what they had
done last night, but Willow’s silence was making her worry.</p>
<p>Willow finally decided that she had to face Buffy. She couldn’t be a
coward and hide, not when Buffy sounded so worried. Turning around in
Buffy’s arms, she gave her friend a hesitant smile. “Morning.” Buffy
smiled in relief when she saw her friend smile at her. She gently traced a
finger down Willow’s cheek and smiled when Willow closed her eyes and leaned
her cheek into the touch.</p>
<p>“I guess we had quite a night last night, huh?” Willow asked, her smile
flickering briefly as she searched her blank memory.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled. “Yeah. You could say that.” Buffy sighed, kissing Willow’s
lips gently. “You were incredible.” Buffy beamed.</p>
<p>“I was?” Willow asked, incredulously. Why couldn’t she remember?! The
most memorable night of her life and she couldn’t remember. It was so
unfair.</p>
<p>“The best.” Buffy confirmed, kissing her again, longer this time. When
she finally pulled back, Willow sighed unhappily. “I wish I could remember
that.” She whispered, then closed her eyes in dismay as the sentence
registered to the Slayer.</p>
<p>“Y-you mean you don’t?” The slayer stuttered. “Of course she doesn’t.
She was under a spell, you dope.” Buffy started castigating herself.</p>
<p> “A spell?” Willow asked, both eyebrows shot into her hairline.

<p>Buffy didn’t notice Willow’s question continuing to berate herself and
fate. “Great, I finally get to make love to her and she doesn’t even get to
remember it.” Buffy muttered bitterly,
sitting up and wrapping her arms around her knees.</p>
<p>“What spell?!” Willow asked, clearly confused. “A spell from the book?”
Willow asked.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Buffy asked, clearly lost in her own world of misery. “Yeah, I
guess. All I know is you were reading that spell book of yours that you got
yesterday while I was excersizing.
The next thing I know, you’re coming onto me like there’s no tomorrow. I
tried to resist Will, I really did, but I’ve wanted you for so long, and you
kept touching me, and I really thought that
you would at least remember it.” Buffy complained, going off on a tangent.</p>
<p>Finally, some of what Buffy got past Willow’s wondering about the spell and
registered on her brain. “Wait a minute. Did you say that you finally got
to make love to me? How long have you wanted me Buffy?” Willow asked
gently, staring intently into Buffy’s beautiful blue eyes.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Willow for a long moment. Then she shrugged. What the
heck, she had already done the worst possible thing she could think of to
ruin their friendship and Willow was
still here. Maybe she had a chance after all. “You remember that day at
SunnyDale High when you were sitting on the bench and I came up to you and
asked if you’d help me with my home work?”</p>
<p>Willow blinked. “Of course I do Buffy, that was the first day we met. How
could I forget? I kept trying to warn you away from the school nerd
and....wait a minute. Are you saying you wanted me from the first day we
met!” Willow asked, her eyes wide.</p>
<p> Buffy shrugged, half embarrassed. “Yup.”

<p>Willow shook her head in disbelief. “Well, why didn’t you ever say
anything?”</p>
<p>“Do the words, ‘I’m so in love with Xander Harris but he doesn’t even know
I’m alive except as a friend.’ ring a bell?” Buffy asked, gently tweaking
her friend. Willow nodded turning red from embarrassment. “Besides, I
didn’t want to scare you off by saying I wanted to jump your bones.” Buffy
teased gently.</p>
<p>Willow laughed outright at that. Buffy giggled too, she loved to see
Willow laugh. “Okay, I understand that. But what about after that?”</p>
<p>“Well, there was always one thing or another coming between us...and I
didn’t want to lose your friendship. I’ve never had a friend as a good as
you, Will. I always want you in my life.” Buffy said quietly.</p>
<p>Willow sobered at that. She gently took Buffy’s hand in hers, intertwining
their fingers together. “I will always be here, Buffy.” She tugged her
friend down into a hug and they lay
there quietly for a few minutes. “You know...there’s just one thing that I
regret.” Willow said finally.</p>
<p> “What’s that?” Buffy asked, cautiously.

<p>“I wish I remembered last night. I bet it was great.” Willow said, shyly,
a little embarrassed at her boldness.</p>
<p>“It was better than great.” Buffy confirmed, staring into Willow’s bright
green eyes. A germ of an idea started in the back of her mind, causing
Buffy to smile a little. “You know, I can’t make you remember last night.
But there’s nothing that says I can’t try to recreate it for you.” Buffy
smiled.</p>
<p>Willow’s smile transformed slowly from embarrassed to passionate. “Do you
want to?”</p>
<p>Buffy looked Willow’s body up and down, recalling it all from memory. “Oh
yeah, I definitely want to.” Buffy said, her voice husky with passion.
Willow shivered at the tone, a thrill of passion kindling inside her, as
Buffy leaned down and showed her just how much she wanted to.</p>
