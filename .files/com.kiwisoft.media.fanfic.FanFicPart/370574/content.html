<p style="text-align:center;"><b>6</b></p>
<p>"Well, Stewart," said Trina cheerfully at breakfast the next morning, "it's a beautiful day."</p>
<p>"If you mean that the table is back, then yes, it <i>is</i> a beautiful day," said Miley. "Otherwise, I disagree heartily." She put her tray down beside where Lilly was sitting and began to eat her breakfast.</p>
<p>"Oh, I wouldn't disagree so soon," said Trina, enjoying herself immensely. "We have some great activities planned for today."</p>
<p>"Oh, too bad," said Miley sadly. "I'm going to be busy all day."</p>
<p>Trina laughed delightedly. "Yes, I know. In fact, this is going to be the busiest day you've ever had."</p>
<p>Miley cocked her head and glanced at her counselor curiously. Something was in the wind.</p>
<p>"I don't like the sound of that," whispered Lilly. "She's up to something."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged indifferently and continued eating.</p>
<p>Just as she finished her breakfast, Marina and three of the other counselors approached table 13 and stationed themselves behind her. "You're Stewart," said the head counselor.</p>
<p>"I knew that," replied Miley lightly.</p>
<p>"Well, here's something you may not know," said Marina. "This morning you're playing baseball and soccer, and before lunch you're going swimming."</p>
<p>"I don't play baseball or soccer," said Miley calmly, "and I don't swim. Lunch we can negotiate."</p>
<p>"Maybe you didn't hear me," returned Marina firmly. "I'm not asking you—I'm telling you. Now, as I was saying, that's the morning. We'll tell you about the afternoon later."</p>
<p>"You mean," said Miley, staring straight ahead, "I don't get any choice?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you get a choice," said Marina. "You can play—or you can play."</p>
<p>Miley nodded slowly. "That seems fair enough. I accept."</p>
<p>"That means you too, Truscott," put in Trina. "How do you like them apples, Stewart?"</p>
<p>Miley just stared at her through half-closed eyes. She reached under the table subtly, grabbing Lilly's hand. Lilly looked over at her in surprise, but Miley only squeezed her hand once before releasing it. Lilly offered a crooked smile, and Miley went back to eating her breakfast passively.</p>
<p>"All right, Stewart," called Trina from behind the backstop. "You're up first."</p>
<p>Miley glared at her, selected a bat and stepped up to the plate, assuming a right-handed stance.</p>
<p>"Hey, Trina, aren't you going to tell her which end to hold?" called Ashley from the players' bench.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Ashley," said Trina absently. She could not take her eyes off Miley, who was standing in the batter's box with her feet quite close together, her knees turned slightly inwards. "You'll get more power, Stewart, if you spread those feet a little."</p>
<p>Miley ignored her and remained like a statue in her odd stance. The pitcher wound up and threw a straight fastball, right into the strike zone. Miley reared back her left leg and stepped into the pitch. The swing made a whining sound in the air.</p>
<p><i>Tock!</i> The ball soared up and away and was out of sight instantly. Miley rounded the bases, a bored expression on her face.</p>
<p>"That's the hardest hit ball I've ever seen!" cried Trina as Miley crossed the plate. "It went way out there! Way out!"</p>
<p>"Wow!" said Kitty, the opposing coach. "Nobody can hit a ball that far!"</p>
<p>"Stewart can!" howled Trina. "She just did! I saw it!" She turned to Marina, who was acting as scorekeeper. "One to nothing! Mark that down! All right, Ashley, you're up next. Let's see you do that."</p>
<p>Ashley struck out, swinging wildly at the first three pitches. Then Megan popped out and Esmerelda grounded out to retire the side.</p>
<p>"All right, you guys," ordered Trina, "take the field. Stewart, you play second base."</p>
<p>The batter wound up and lobbed a fat one right over the plate. <i>Crack!</i> Trina groaned. It was a line drive just over the pitcher's head, and sure to be good for at least two bases. From out of nowhere flew Miley Stewart. She leaped, stuck out her glove and picked the well-hit ball gracefully out of the air.</p>
<p>"Did you see that?" screamed Trina. "That was the greatest catch in the history of baseball! I've never seen anything like it before in my whole life! What a play!"</p>
<p>In that inning, Miley stopped a hot grounder and threw to first base for the second out, and then caught an almost impossible short fly ball for the third out.</p>
<p>"What a catch!" Trina was raving. "I've never seen an infielder run backwards like that! One to nothing! It's still one to nothing! We're winning!"</p>
<p>As the next Cabin 13 batter stepped up to the plate, Miley sat down on the bench beside Lilly. Lilly looked at her oddly. "Miley, do you do stuff like that all the time?"</p>
<p>"Only when I'm playing baseball," said Miley sourly, "which is usually never, if I can help it."</p>
<p>"Trina is having hysterics," said Lilly.</p>
<p>"It doesn't take much," said Miley. "I'm sure you've noticed that."</p>
<p>"Well, Stephanie struck out," said Lilly. "I'm up. Got any pointers for me?"</p>
<p>"No," said Miley coldly.</p>
<p>The next two innings went quickly. Miley, switched to center field, ended the third inning with the miraculous catch of a sure homerun ball, followed up by a long throw to first base to catch the runner trying to tag up.</p>
<p>"That was the most amazing double play in the whole world!" raved Trina. "What a throw! It didn't even bounce! What an arm! Wow! We're still ahead," she reminded Marina. "Still one to nothing. And Stewart's up this inning!"</p>
<p>Sarah, the Cabin 13 pitcher, struck out feebly, and that brought Miley to the plate.</p>
<p>"Come on, Stewart!" cheered Trina. "Do it again!"</p>
<p>"She could never do it again," piped up Ashley. "It was a fluke." She got a catcher's mitt right in the mouth from Lilly.</p>
<p>The first pitch was low and outside. Ball one, thought Trina. But Miley crouched down, moved forward and reached for the ball.</p>
<p><i>Tock!</i> Like its predecessor, this ball soared fast and far and out of sight. Expressionless, Miley ran the bases.</p>
<p>Trina cheered herself hoarse. "That one must have flown all the way to the dump! Bring on another ball!" She turned to Marina. "That's two to nothing. We've got two runs now!"</p>
<p>Ashley walked, and it looked like the beginning of a rally for Cabin 13, but Megan hit into a double play to retire the side.</p>
<p>"All right, Stewart, you're pitching!" ordered Trina joyfully.</p>
<p>Obediently Miley took the mound. She burned nine consecutive strikes past baffled Cabin 3 batters. When she got to the bench, Lilly was blowing on her sore catching hand.</p>
<p>Trina was gibbering by this time. "What an arm! What an arm! Nine strikes! Wow! Two to nothing," she reminded Marina.</p>
<p>Marina walked over to Trina. "Say—uh—Trina, can I have a word with you?"</p>
<p>"Not now! Not now! Can't you see we're in the middle of a game? And it's two to nothing! For <i>us!</i>"</p>
<p>"Hey," said Marina, "haven't you been holding out on us a little about this kid Stewart?"</p>
<p>"Holding out? I told you she wouldn't play!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, well she's played someplace. A girl who's that good—"</p>
<p>"We'll talk about this later," said Trina. "All right, you guys, up to bat. Let's get some hits here! Can't let Stewart do all the work, right, Stewart?"</p>
<p>Miley just glared at her.</p>
<p>It was the sixth inning and the score was still 2-0 when Miley came up to bat again. The pitcher wound up and threw a low ball that broke to the inside and clipped Miley on the back of the leg.</p>
<p>"What are you trying to do?" screamed Trina. Only the efforts of Sarah and Lilly prevented her from going for Kitty's throat. "You dusted her off just because you knew she was going to hit another home run! Stewart, <i>Stewart</i>, are you all right? Speak to me! Can you walk?"</p>
<p>With a contemptuous glance over her shoulder at her counselor, Miley jogged down to first base.</p>
<p>"All right, Ashley," shouted Trina. "Bring her home. Let's get some hits out there!"</p>
<p>No sooner did the ball leave the pitcher's hand than Miley was off like a shot. The infield was taken so much by surprise that she went into second base standing up.</p>
<p>"What speed!" bawled Trina. "I've never seen anybody move that fast! She didn't even have to slide! All right, Ashley, you've got one strike! Now get a hit!"</p>
<p>Miley took a long lead off second base, ignoring the signals from Trina, who had assumed the coaching spot behind third. Suddenly the pitcher wheeled and threw to the shortstop, who was covering second. Opting not to go back, Miley took off for third. Kicking up a huge cloud of dust, she slid in just under the tag.</p>
<p>"You're just a blue streak!" Trina bellowed right in Miley's ear. "Attaway, Stewart!"</p>
<p>Miley stood up, brushed herself off and scowled at her counselor.</p>
<p>On the second pitch, Ashley swung mightily and managed to hit a dribbling grounder that oozed out towards the mound.</p>
<p>Miley took off like a gazelle, her feet hardly touching the ground.</p>
<p>"No, Stewart! No! Stay put!" cried Trina.</p>
<p>The pitcher fumbled at the ball, then scooped it up and threw it home. But the catcher's eyes were on Miley, bearing down on her like a freight train. The ball bounced off her mask, and as she stooped to retrieve it, Miley dove between her feet and tagged home. Safe. Almost as an afterthought, the catcher picked up the ball and threw it to first. Ashley was out.</p>
<p>"Did you see that?" Trina was delirious. "Did you actually <i>see</i> that? It was—it was—it's three to nothing! We've got three runs! She stole home! And we've got a man on—Oh no! Ashley, what were you doing? Sightseeing or something? A turtle could have made it to first!"</p>
<p>By the end of the ninth inning, Cabin 13 was ahead four to nothing, Miley having hit a third home run.</p>
<p>Trina was in ecstasy. "We <i>won!</i> We finally won a game! It was the most amazing incredible fantastic stupendous game in baseball history! Stewart, you said you couldn't play baseball!"</p>
<p>"I never said I couldn't," said Miley blandly, "I said I don't."</p>
<p>Marina walked up to Trina. "Congratulations," she said coldly. "I guess you've got the camp championship all sewed up."</p>
<p>"I guess so," chortled Trina gleefully. "Isn't Stewart something?"</p>
<p>"At baseball," said Marina grimly. "Let's see if she can play soccer." She turned to Miley. "I suppose you don't play soccer."</p>
<p>"That's right," said Miley hopefully. "I don't."</p>
<p>"Well, you're going to," said the head counselor. "Cabin 13, get over to the soccer field. Cabin 9 is waiting for you."</p>
<p>As the girls made their way to the soccer field, Lilly jogged up to Miley. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"For what?" Miley asked listlessly.</p>
<p>"For asking you for batting tips," said Lilly.</p>
<p>"I accept your apology."</p>
<p>Lilly laughed to herself. Some things changed, but Miley never did.</p>
<p>"All right, you guys!" bellowed Trina. "Take the field and play your positions! Stewart, you're a forward." She turned to Ruby, the Cabin 9 counselor. "Ruby, we just won a baseball game that you wouldn't believe!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I would!" exclaimed Ruby. "I was walking across the compound when that home-run ball nearly took my head off. So I came to watch the rest of the game. The whole camp's buzzing about your Stewart. You kept her a secret, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"No!" Trina's denial was vehement. "She kept herself a secret! She wouldn't play!"</p>
<p>"A star like that? Don't make me laugh!"</p>
<p>"But—" said Trina.</p>
<p>The game was under way. Instantly Miley stole the ball and maneuvered her way through the Cabin 9 defense in a manner which left many of them sprawled on the grass. Effortlessly she approached the opposing goal and kicked. Like a cannonball, the ball went into the top right-hand corner of the net. The goalie did not even see it, and made no move. Lilly watched the whole thing from her position near the opposite goal. She marveled at how Miley played, graceful and fluid, despite the roughness of her approach. Somehow, Miley managed to look feminine while maintaining her powerhouse skill.</p>
<p>"Did you see that? She decked out the whole team! What feet! And what a kick! It's a wonder the ball isn't flat as a pancake!" Trina turned to Marina, who was acting as scorekeeper, but before she could open her mouth the head counselor said sourly. "Yes, I know. One to nothing for you. I've already marked it down. I guess you think you've been pretty cute about this kid Stewart."</p>
<p>"Honest," cried Trina earnestly, "I'm the most surprised girl in the place! I thought she'd be a dud, not wanting to play and all. I just don't understand it." She glanced towards the field. "Hey, Stewart's got the ball again! Come on, Stewart! Pass!"</p>
<p>"Who's she going to pass to?" asked Marina bitterly. "Nobody on the field can keep up with her."</p>
<p>"A goal! A goal!" cheered Trina. "Two to nothing! Mark that down!"</p>
<p>When the game ended, Cabin 13 had won, 18-0. Miley Stewart had scored ten of those goals and assisted on six others.</p>
<p>"Oh," said Lauren, the swimming coach, "you're the girl who can't swim."</p>
<p>After their second amazing victory, the girls of Cabin 13 were standing around on the swimming pier awaiting their turn in the water.</p>
<p>Marina elbowed Trina in the stomach. "There goes your living legend," she gloated. "Stewart can't swim."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll take care of that," promised Lauren. "Go get a flutterboard and I'll teach you how to kick."</p>
<p>"You'd better get her a rubber ducky," sneered Ashley.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Ashley!" ordered Trina. "That'll cost you another day's work detail!"</p>
<p>"Okay, everybody," said Lauren, "into the water. Recreational swimming while I work with Stewart."</p>
<p>Passively Miley allowed herself to be led into the water. She draped her toned body over a styrofoam flutterboard. She had been kicking around in a small circle, earning Lauren's praise, when she heard an angry shout from the pier.</p>
<p>"Ashley," bawled Trina "you're beyond the limit! Get back in here!"</p>
<p>"I can't!" quavered Ashley from way out. "I've got a cramp!"</p>
<p>Instantly Trina threw herself into the water and began splashing out towards Ashley. "Wait here!" shouted Lauren to Miley, and she too began swimming towards Ashley.</p>
<p>As Miley watched, Ashley went under for a few seconds and came up sputtering.</p>
<p>"That twit," Miley commented aloud. She tossed aside her flutterboard and began to swim long, powerful strokes that carried her swiftly through the water. She passed Lauren and began to pull ahead of Trina.</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart!</i> Get back there! You can't swim!"</p>
<p>Miley reached the struggling Ashley well ahead of the two counselors. Grasping her in approved Red Cross fashion, Miley began a powerful side-stroke which soon brought the two of them back to the pier. She boosted Ashley up to Marina's waiting arms, retrieved her drifting flutterboard and resumed her kicking.</p>
<p>Trina and Lauren swam up. Lauren snatched the board away from Miley and turned to Trina. "She can't swim, eh?" She brought the flutterboard down on top of Trina's head. It broke in two.</p>
<p>"You might have told me you could swim like that!" said Trina at the lunch table.</p>
<p>"You didn't ask," said Miley.</p>
<p>"I'm not complaining," explained Trina hastily. "You were just great out there this morning." She surveyed the girls at table 13. "This is a great day. We're just starting to click as a team."</p>
<p>"A team?" laughed Sarah ruefully. "Stewart did it all by herself. She could have beaten those guys without us. In fact, I think we got in her way."</p>
<p>"No way!" insisted Trina. "We're a team. Right, girls?"</p>
<p>"Right," they all chorused, tiredly and without much conviction.</p>
<p>Miley took a bite of her sandwich. "Hey, this tastes stale."</p>
<p>Trina flushed. "No, Stewart, you're not poisoned. Heh, heh, great little kidder, that Stewart."</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't stop thinking about the way Miley had looked in her swimsuit earlier. Sure, the rescue had been awesome, but it wasn't Ashley's foundering she was remembering, it was the perfect, seamless tan on Miley's incredibly shapely and desirable body that stuck in her mind. Attempting to direct her thoughts elsewhere, she nudged Miley. "You're not going to go berserk and kill somebody, are you?"</p>
<p>"I can't guarantee anything," replied Miley evenly.</p>
<p>Lilly grinned. "Tell me," she said, "what happens when you play other sports?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Same thing."</p>
<p>Lilly whistled. "I don't think Trina is going to be able to stand it. She's going crazy."</p>
<p>"For her it's a short trip," observed Miley.</p>
<p>"Wow!" screamed Trina as Miley came off the obstacle course well ahead of the rest of Cabin 13. "That must be a new camp record! Way to go, Stewart! What a workout!" She turned to Marina. "Look at that! The kid didn't even work up a sweat! What an athlete!"</p>
<p>"Strange she should only show up now," said the head counselor sourly.</p>
<p>"Did you see that forehand smash?" howled Trina as Miley danced around the tennis court opposite Libby, Algonkian's tennis instructor. "Stewart's winning! She's beating Libby in straight sets!"</p>
<p>"Shut up, Trina!" panted Libby warningly.</p>
<p>"We've got nineteen now! Mark that down," Trina barked at Marina. "That Stewart! She's scored twelve goals!"</p>
<p>"So far," said Marina dryly.</p>
<p>"You know, Trina," exclaimed Leona, the opposing coach, "nobody scores twelve goals in field hockey! We haven't even got a point yet!"</p>
<p>Trina's answer was a joyous laugh. "Ha! Twenty to nothing! Mark that down!" She cupped her hand to her mouth. "Way to go, Stewart!"</p>
<p>"Well, let's see," said Marina sarcastically, tallying up the track and field results for the day. "Stewart took the hundred meter dash, and the three hundred meters was—ah, yes, Stewart again. The long jump went to Stewart, as did the high jump and the triple jump. The fifty and two hundred meter hurdles—Stewart won both. Ditto the shot-put, the discus and the javelin." She paused to glare at Trina. "And you say you didn't know?"</p>
<p>"Honest!" cried Trina. "How could I know? Until today she never played anything here! She's weird, that's all! And this is part of it!" Her earnest face broke into a wide smile. "But gosh, can she ever hit a baseball!"</p>
<p>"Well," said Lilly, tossing her last bag of garbage onto the heap, "I guess you've had quite a day."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Miley. "And I don't intend to have another one like it ever again. I'm getting out of here tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Can I come along?" asked Lilly. "I wasn't too thrilled with today either."</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "If you like."</p>
<p>"It's a good thing you're leaving," said Lilly. "Pretty soon the clones would start coming at you with trophies."</p>
<p>"I've got enough of those," replied Miley grimly. "I keep them on some shelves in the garage. Of course, my parents already have a spot reserved for my future Olympic medals. Maybe I'll get them a stuffed raccoon to fill the empty space."</p>
<p>"You're so good at everything," said Lilly, her voice filled with awe, "and you still hate sports."</p>
<p>"With a passion," agreed Miley emotionlessly.</p>
<p>"Well, then, Ashley is right," said Lilly. "You are a nut." She grinned. "And I must be a nut too, because I think I understand."</p>
<p>"Hi, guys," said Trina, walking into the mess hall where the counselors were meeting. "Sorry I'm late."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's quite all right," said Kitty sarcastically. "It gave us a few extra minutes to talk about poor you and your problem kid, Stewart."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" Trina demanded.</p>
<p>There was a babble of angry voices until Marina rapped on the table for silence. "The girls are pretty mad at you, Trina," she said.</p>
<p>"We figure you made awful fools of us. You practically begged us to force Stewart to join the sports program, and then you sent her out there to wipe everyone else out. That's pretty underhanded. We're trying to promote good clean fun here."</p>
<p>Trina sat down wearily. "Look," she said, "for the last time, I didn't know anything about Stewart being the world's greatest natural athlete. How could I? I couldn't get her to play anything."</p>
<p>"But she won everything, Trina!" cried Marina. "Even the lousy game of horseshoes after supper! You can't make me believe that anyone that good refuses to play sports!"</p>
<p>"Well, it's the truth, take it or leave it!" said Trina angrily. "And don't think I don't know what's really eating you guys. You're sore because my one kid made your whole cabins look sick. Well, I don't know if you noticed, but she made my cabin look sick too. And that's as much of a problem as anything else. Our girls'll never work up any team spirit with one kid doing it all. And besides, good or bad, Stewart's got as much right to play as anyone else!"</p>
<p>There was low discontented mumbling.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Marina, "that's all for tonight. Let's sleep on it."</p>
<p>The beaver sniffed at the round white thing that had fallen from the sky that morning and lodged in his dam. What was it? He nudged it with his nose. It seemed harmless. Warily, he poked it aside. It rolled off the dam, landed in the creek with a plop and sank.</p>
<p>He settled himself down to rest. There was much work to do tomorrow. He hoped that no more strange things would come falling down from the sky.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><i><b>A/N: Okay, I'm finally giving you guys an author's note. I would have gone back and put them at the starts of the chapters, but ya know. So...how do you like it so far? I have to say one thing up front, THIS IS NOT ORIGINAL FICTION. It's from a book by Gordon Korman called "I Want To Go Home". Originally it was about boys at a camp, & it was always one of my favorite books, so I thought I'd adapt it to Liley. Mostly got the inspiration to do this from croaker & his "Lessons" story. If you haven't read that one, you're seriously missing out.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>There was no romantic storyline in the book, so I am trying to weave one in as best I can. It will be slow going at first, because the story is mostly about showcasing Miley, but don't worry, I won't let the entire story go by without some really good Liley scenes. Just a warning, this is not a long story, there will only be 14 chapters total. Also, if you see any mistakes (such as accidentally leaving in a guy's name, or putting 'he' for 'she', etc.), please let me know so I can go back and correct them. Thanks for reading! And thank you SO MUCH to all the kind reviewers who have already left their thoughts! PS-bear with me on the beaver thing, it's an important part of the story in the end...that's all I'm saying...</b></i></p>
