<!-- Live A Little \ Part 1 -->

<p>It was almost midnight as Sam sat at her desk, her eyes glued to the monitor in front of her. </p>

<p>"You need to lay off the fan fiction, dearie!"</p>

<p>Letting out a startled yelp, Sam leapt out of her chair. Taking a few moments to recover from the shock, Sam turned around, ready to blast whoever dared interrupt her reading. She froze, unable to believe what she was seeing. </p>

<p>Blinking rapidly, Sam was convinced that hours sitting in front of the computer had reduced her eyes to mush. She rubbed her eyes and continued to stare wide-eyed at the vision before her. </p>

<p>"Relax Sam, you're not going to mental. I'm really here."</p>

<p>"I know this is a stupid question, but who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm you, just from another timeline. An alternate universe if you will."</p>

<p>"This cannot be happening."</p>

<p>"Well, it is, so get over it."</p>

<p>"Alternate universe? That stuff is true?"</p>

<p>"Hey, Star Trek isn't just for geeks, you know! Besides, there isn't just one alternate universe. There are millions. Every action, every reaction, every choice has it's own path, it's own timeline."</p>

<p>"You're kidding me."</p>

<p>"Nope. For example, yesterday you decided to eat chocolate ice-cream, after debating for hours whether you should eat strawberry."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Well, in another universe, you went with strawberry. In another, you ate both. It may be an insignificant detail, but something as small as that can lead to a completely different outcome in your life. In another timeline, Sam McPherson is a guy, and in another, you live in Australia. There are endless possibilities and each timeline reflects that!"</p>

<p>"Should you even be telling me this?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well, doesn't that change everything? Me knowing all this, what if I go and tell everybody what you told me?"</p>

<p>"And they will believe you, why?"</p>

<p>"Good point."</p>

<p>"Besides, I'm not here to tell you your future. I'm here to offer you guidance and all that sappy stuff."</p>

<p>"What about you're life?"</p>

<p>"I'm dead."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I died a few months ago."</p>

<p>"What? How? Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, to cut a long story short, Brooke and I were fighting for Harrison."</p>

<p>"Harrison?!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, can you believe it? I don't know what I was thinking either. Anyway, we all went to the prom together where he informed us that he wanted to date Brooke."</p>

<p>"Gee, what a surprise."</p>

<p>"It's not what you think. Harrison, at least my Harrison, loved me. I guess he just loved Brooke more."</p>

<p>"So, what happened?"</p>

<p>"Brooke ran off crying."</p>

<p>"I don't understand! She wanted him, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"I'll get to that. So she runs off, and I went after her. I get outside and I see Nicole trying to run her over with a car."</p>

<p>"What?!"</p>

<p>"She was drunk, she and Brooke weren't on speaking terms."</p>

<p>"Oh my god. And you..."</p>

<p>"Yep. I pushed Brooke out of the way, and got hit. Hurt like a bitch, I tell you."</p>

<p>"I can't believe this..."</p>

<p>"Sounds like some insane plot from a television show, huh?"</p>

<p>"And you died."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"What about Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Physically, she's fine."</p>

<p>"That's good to know. How is she dealing with my...your death?"</p>

<p>"She's devastated."</p>

<p>"She is?"</p>

<p>"She was in love with me."</p>

<p>"She was?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. She told me as I was dying."</p>

<p>"And you..."</p>

<p>"Love her too."</p>

<p>"And how's mum?"</p>

<p>"Not much better."</p>

<p>"Jesus."</p>

<p>"He's a nice guy."</p>

<p>"What? Don't answer that, just let me think about all this okay?"</p>

<p>"I know it's a lot to take in."</p>

<p>"You think?"</p>

<p>"I never realised how annoying my sarcastic side was."</p>

<p>"Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"I don't want you to make the same mistake that I did."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You're in love with Brooke."</p>

<p>"Am not!"</p>

<p>"Oh give it up Sam! You're talking to yourself remember!"</p>

<p>"Isn't my timeline different than yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. But there are plenty of similarities, which is why I'm here. Your feelings for Brooke are exactly the same as mine."</p>

<p>"Does my Brooke feel the same way about me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You don't know?"</p>

<p>"I can't read minds Sam!"</p>

<p>"And you want me to tell her how I feel."</p>

<p>"That pretty much sums it up."</p>

<p>"No way. Can't you go haunt another Sam or something?"</p>

<p>"Nope, you're stuck with me."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"Till I drive you crazy."</p>

<p>"You're doing a good job of it so far."</p>

<p>"Thankyou."</p>

<p>"Well, do you have to stand there the entire time? Go for a walk or something."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I'm stuck to you. Like that Heart and Souls movie."</p>

<p>"Oh great."</p>

<p>"Let's go visit Brooke!"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh come on! I haven't seen her up close in months. Please!"</p>

<p>"Would she be able to see you?"</p>

<p>"No. Only you can."</p>

<p>"You won't be able to take over my body will you?"</p>

<p>"No, unfortunately. If I did, the first thing I'd do is kiss Brooke senseless."</p>

<p>"Hey! She's my Brooke and if there is any kissing, I'll be the one to do it, okay?!"</p>

<p>"D'uh! That's why I'm here, dumb ass!"</p>

<p>"Do you miss her? Your Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Like you wouldn't believe."</p>

<p>"I'm really sorry. About what happened to you."</p>

<p>"I'd do it over and over, a million times, if it meant she was safe."</p>

<p>Sam watches her silently for a few moments. "Let's go visit Brooke."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Sam."</p>

<p>"You're welcome...uh, Sam."</p>

<p>Entering the bathroom, Sam hesitantly raises her hand to knock on the door. Alt Sam stops her by placing a hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"She won't hear you. She's got her head phones on." </p>

<p>"Oh, okay."</p>

<p>Sam silently opens the door and they step inside, watching Brooke type away furiously at the computer, humming away to whatever song she is listening to. Alt Sam walks over and places a kiss on Brooke's head before she crouches beside her, tears making their way down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh my god."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"She's so beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"My Brooke was a brunette"</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. She looks great as a blonde too."</p>

<p>Brooke, sensing that someone is with her, removes her headphones and turns around to find Sam hovering in the doorway talking to...no one.</p>

<p>"Sam?"</p>

<p>Sam looks up, surprised, not realizing that Brooke is now aware of her. "Uh, yeah?"</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing?"</p>

<p>"Why are you staring at me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not staring at you."</p>

<p>"And why are you talking to yourself?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't." Sam watches in amazement as Alt Sam sits on Brooke's lap and places an arm around her shoulders. "What are you doing? Don't sit there!"</p>

<p>Brooke looks at her, confused. "Sit where?"</p>

<p>Alt Sam glares at Sam. "Hey, I'm a dead girl. Let me have some joy, okay?"</p>

<p>"Sam?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What the hell is wrong with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's wrong."</p>

<p>"What are you staring at?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Um, okay. Is there something you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Uh..."</p>

<p>"She smells so good! Just like I remembered" Alt Sam interrupts happily.</p>

<p>"Would you stop talking?" Sam asks Alt Sam.</p>

<p>Brooke frowns. "I wasn't saying anything."</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't talking to you."</p>

<p>"Who were you talking to?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I didn't meant to bother you. I'll be going now."</p>

<p>Alt Sam jumps up. "No!"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>Brooke stands up, annoyed. She wonders if Sam is on drugs. "Yes, what?"</p>

<p>"Goodnight, Brooke. Sorry to interrupt whatever you were doing!" </p>

<p>Brooke watches as Sam then speaks to the empty space beside her. "Come on! Don't make me drag you!" Alt Sam takes one last look at Brooke as she reluctantly gets pulled away. </p>

<p>Brooke just stares in bewilderment as Sam shuts the door behind her.</p>
