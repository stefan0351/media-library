<!-- Listen to Your Heart \ Chapter V -->

<p>"B'Elanna, believe me, I want to. But I am afraid..."</p>
<p>NO!!! SHOT DOWN! CRASH AND BURN!! REJECTION!!</p>
<p>The little world I created for myself during the past weeks - crushed in one moment. I feel more alone then ever before. Her body stiffens and then her arms leave me. The warmth that cradled me like a child only seconds ago evaporates as she pulls away.</p>
<p>The icy claws grip my heart...</p>
<p>Suddenly my head is being held by both her hands and again I'm forced to look at her. I close my eyes. I don't want to look at her. I don't want to see her eyes. I don't want to...</p>
<p>An electric shock pulls me from my self-pity when I feel her lips softly brushing against mine. The movement is hesitant and the contact barely noticeable.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do or think. Is this meant to be a goodbye kiss... ?</p>
<p>My brain proves to be useless at the massive sensory overload and since my heart is that of a warrior and never to run from a battle I open up to the contact. My parting lips is all the invitation she needs. Her tongue darts out on a mission to enter, taste and claim. I let her explore for a moment or two before I start to respond. This first kiss could be the last and I don't want to miss anything. I know she feels the same when she increases the pressure, and I know that this is the seal to our fate as I taste blood. In one bloody violent, lip bruising kiss she conveys what she feels ... and finally what she is afraid of.</p>
<p>My head is spinning and I don't know if it is the lack of oxygen or the burning jolt of ... need ... that explodes in my veins.</p>
<p>Pictures float my mind, and snatches of conversation.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Why can't we be a family anymore...?"</p>
<p>"This is not my daughter!"</p>
<p>"Tom, ..."</p>
<p>"Mom..."</p>
<p>"... Miral, she will be here soon..."</p>
<p>"Where is Daddy...?"</p>
<p>Daddy.<br>Daddy.<br>Daddy.</p>
<p>"Tom, you can't do that..."</p>
<p>"She can go play with Naomi and Seven..."</p>
<p>"We don't play with barbarians..."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna eats earthworms... hehehehehe"</p>
<p>"I saw that coming. I never understood what he saw in her..."</p>
<p>He left me. He left me. He left. He left.</p>
<p>"How many walls did you break down with that head of yours...?"</p>
<p>"Such beauty... if it weren't for her klingon mother..."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Seven must have sensed my distress for she breaks the kiss. Greedily I fill my lungs and for a moment the fog lifts from my inner vision.</p>
<p>With my eyes still closed I watch the scene unfolding in slow motion.</p>
<p>How Seven enters my office in engineering, how she greets me formally and stony faced. How she shifts her gaze and smiles when Miral runs towards her. I feel the jealousy I felt when they left my office holding hands like friends, and just as I did back then I'm strangely wondering whom I'm jealous of...</p>
<p>Then I see two crewmen passing in front of my office and I am about to return to my calculations when I overhear their conversation...</p>
<p>"... irony of fate..."</p>
<p>" Huh?"</p>
<p>" That woman and the child..."</p>
<p>" What about them...?"</p>
<p>" So much wasted beauty..."</p>
<p>" Yeah, it's a pity that such a sexy bombshell is so cold and unattainable..."</p>
<p>"And the child could be the prettiest I've ever seen if it weren't for that klingon forehead..."</p>
<p>"Wonder what she'd look like if her borg friend would be her mother?"</p>
<p>" Hehe, yeah. But you know that's impossible. Who would want to bed that Borg and have a child with her? "</p>
<p>" True..."</p>
<p>I feel anger rising, pure klingon rage boils up my blood and in a swift move I turn around again to go after them. The angular momentum is too high for my body to manage and the following forward movement comes to a sudden halt when my head connects with the doorframe. A black curtain falls and my vision goes blank before I can even hear a thud or feel any pain...</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>I wake up and find myself lying on my couch, in my living room. A hand gently strokes my cheek. Despite the mean headache that awakes with me I pry my eyes open. Seven kneels beside me on the floor, holding my hand close to her chest. My blood reheats at this sight. Before I can collect myself and try to process what happened I am the verge of bursting.</p>
