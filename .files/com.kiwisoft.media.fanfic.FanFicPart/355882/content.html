<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 3: These Foolish Things -->

<p>Dawson was happily surprised to see Joey and Jen laughing together as he approached the main door to Capeside High. Were they actually having a conversation of their own free will, and enjoying it? He almost didn't want to say anything, for fear of shattering whatever it was they were achieving.</p>
		<p>"Hey guys, what's so funny?" He finally asked, as he came up behind Joey and circled his arm around her waist.</p>
		<p>"Oh nothing, Dawson, just girl stuff," Jen replied cryptically, raising one eyebrow at Joey, who bit her lip to hold in more laughter.</p>
		<p>"Indeed," Dawson said, half to himself. Although he was incredibly relieved to see these two getting along for a change, he felt a bit left out. At that moment, Pacey made his entrance with a giant rubber tarantula, which he tossed at Jen from behind before she got a chance to see him. She shrieked and jumped back, straight into Pacey's arms, which made her scream again.</p>
		<p>"Gotcha!" he cried triumphantly, releasing her after only a moment of struggle. "Don't ever say you never got a good scare from this crowd," he chuckled while Jen hit him on the arm and yelled at him halfheartedly.</p>
		<p>"C'mon, Pacey," Dawson said suddenly, grabbing his friend's sleeve. "We've got guy stuff to talk about." Pacey was confused but Dawson gave him a just-go-with-me look, so he concurred. Dawson gave Joey a quick goodbye kiss, and then he realized he might have made Jen feel left out, so he added, "See you later, Jen."</p>
		<p>"Ladies, you know where to find me," Pacey said in swanky drawl, as he followed Dawson inside.</p>
		<p>"Unfortunately," Joey agreed, turning back to her conversation with Jen.</p>
		<p>Dawson and Pacey went quickly into the boys' room, for a few private moments before class started. "So what's up, man?" Pacey inquired, seeing that Dawson really did have something on his mind.</p>
		<p>"When I got to school, Jen and Joey were talking about something, and they looked like they were really having a good conversation-- but when I came over, they stopped talking about whatever it was, and they wouldn't tell me. They said it was 'girl talk' or something."</p>
		<p>"So?" Pacey said. "You never heard of the feminine mystique?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know, it just made me uneasy. Like, what can Joey tell Jen that she can't tell me?"</p>
		<p>"Aha," Pacey said slowly, shaking his head. "Look Dawson, there are gonna be some changes going on around here, and you'll have to accept it. You and Joey have always been best friends, right? That designates you as the one she tells everything. Of course, we know that hasn't really been true for a while cause she had a major crush on you all year and never said anything about that. Now that you're dating, that part is just going to be magnified-- she needs someone else, someone not in the middle of the issue, to talk to about stuff like that. And it wouldn't hurt you, either," he added as an after note.</p>
		<p>"So what are saying, Pacey?" Dawson griped. Jesus, thought Pacey, for someone so smart, Dawson sure was a stupid ass sometimes.</p>
		<p>"I'm saying, O perceptive one, that Joey was probably asking Jen for sex advice!"</p>
		<p>"...You think so?" Dawson asked hopefully. He'd spent the majority of his time for the past month thinking about having sex with Joey, but he'd just assumed...well...girls need time for that kind of thing.</p>
		<p>"Yes, Dawson, I think so. This relationship may be new in the official sense, but it's not like you need time to get to know each other. And speaking as someone with three sisters, let me tell you, girls think about sex just as much as we do. Sometimes more, I'd say." Pacey grinned fiendishly. Dawson hadn't even considered that Joey was seriously thinking about sex, in the immediate sense. He felt like a whole new world of possibility was opening up in front of him, and it was too exciting for him to just sit still.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Pacey," Dawson grinned as he ran out of the bathroom. "You're the best!"</p>
		<p>"Don't mention it," Pacey sighed as Dawson left. He was beginning to feel like all he was to Dawson anymore was an advice column. All they ever talked about was Joey, and as soon as Dawson felt like he had 'the answer,' he was gone. It was getting pretty old. Hell, Pacey thought, I finally have what I always needed-- more time to study.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>When Dawson got to his usual lunch table, Joey was already there, with another girl who looked vaguely familiar, but Dawson was sure he'd never seen her with Joey before. "Hey, Cutie," he said as he approached, giving her an unusually enthusiastic kiss for the lunchroom.</p>
		<p>"Easy, boy," Joey said as she broke away from him, catching her breath. "I don't want to break any public decency laws." They sat back down, Dawson across from Joey, who was next to this new girl. "Dawson, do you know Kaela Barnes?" Kaela smiled at him and offered her hand. She wasn't quite as tall as Joey (but then again, most girls weren't), and she had a splash of freckles across the bridge of her nose. Her long hair was almost black, but really more like dark brown, Dawson thought, and her eyes were the clearest ocean blue. In short, she was not at all unattractive, and to top it all off she had a very pleasant smile. Her dress, Dawson thought immediately, placed her in the experimental hippie category of Capeside High-- a pair of torn up old overalls over a cotton Indian print shirt, and Doc Martens that looked like they'd seen half the world and then some.</p>
		<p>"Hi," she said warmly, "the famous Dawson Leary. At last we meet." Dawson was taken aback momentarily, feeling guilty that she seemed to know who he was, but he wasn't quite sure about her.</p>
		<p>"Kaela's my partner for that dreaded Spanish presentation I told you about," Joey explained, and Kaela gave Joey a playful shove.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe you're being so negative already, Jo. We haven't even started yet! The topic is wide open, we can do anything we want." Kaela's manner was easy and relaxed, even though she had left the safety of her usual lunch table, wherever that was.</p>
		<p>"Right," Joey said, "that's why we need to have this lunch meeting. So just keep quiet for a few minutes, okay Dawson?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, no problem, I'll just bond with my pbj," he said mockingly, getting a pinch on the arm from Joey, which shut him up.</p>
		<p>"I want to do Octavio Paz," Kaela said excitedly. "We can talk about 'Mi Vida con la Ola,' I love that one."</p>
		<p>"I like him, too, but I've only read his work in translation, not actually in Spanish-- let alone lead a discussion about it," Joey pointed out nervously.</p>
		<p>"Come on, scaredy-cat, aren't you up for a challenge?" Kaela raised one eyebrow expectantly, grinning like the devil. Joey wasn't one to let herself be called chicken.</p>
		<p>"Okay, Paz it is," she agreed finally.</p>
		<p>"Great!" Kaela jumped up from her chair and squeezed Joey's hand. "I'll go tell Mrs. Adelman now, I hope no one else signed up for him yet." She was off like a flash, leaving her lunch hardly touched on the table.</p>
		<p>"Well," Dawson said after a moment of silence, "she sure is a bundle of energy."</p>
		<p>"Yeah," Joey grinned, "I wish more girls at this dumb school used their energy as well as she does." Jen and Pacey arrived at the same time, from the lunch counter, braving the daily special.</p>
		<p>"Yuck," Pacey complained, "if I'd known it was going to be cigar butts in gallstone sauce, I would've been more motivated to make my own lunch today."</p>
		<p>"It's franks and beans, Jerk, and thanks for spoiling what's left of my appetite," Jen said shortly.</p>
		<p>"Didn't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities, Princess," Pacey said in mock apology.</p>
		<p>"Oh, lay off it, you two," Joey said, laughing. "You've got better things to say to each other than that, I hope." Pacey looked at Joey cautiously-- since when did she oppose catty sarcasm battles?</p>
		<p>A minute later, Kaela returned from their teacher's office, triumphant. "We got it!" she announced, grinning. Joey introduced her to Pacey and Jen, and she sat down again. They had all wasted a good amount of the lunch period talking, so the last few minutes were relatively quiet as they all tried to finish their lunch.</p>
		<p>"So Dawson," Pacey said eventually, his mouth full of the mystery meat, "you wanna come over after school today and help me with the truck?" "Um," Dawson stalled, feeling hesitant. After the morning's revelation of new possibilities with Joey, he'd wanted to get her alone this afternoon.</p>
		<p>"Oh, go on," Joey said when he looked to her, shooing him with her hand. "You boys go play with your truck. It'll be manly." She smiled suggestively at Dawson, who wasn't sure whether to be disappointed or not. "...And when you get it up and running, we'll all go somewhere fun. Like a road trip."</p>
		<p>"Okay, sure," Dawson agreed, and Pacey decided that was good enough, even though he hadn't seemed to want to at first.</p>
		<p>"That leaves us girls all to ourselves," Jen remarked conspiratorially. "What kind of trouble can we get into today?"</p>
		<p>"Actually," Joey said, "Kaela and I really need to get going on our Spanish presentation..." Jen looked disappointed, and Joey felt guilty-- after all, she and Jen were just starting to really become friends, and she didn't want her to feel like a fifth wheel. "But why don't we all go out for coffee first?"</p>
		<p>"Sure," Jen said, "I've been looking for a good excuse to try the new triple espresso supreme." Her spirits seemed to be raised, so Joey was satisfied.</p>
		<p>"I'm game," Kaela said as she gathered her things off the table. "Sounds like just the thing to get me going for an afternoon of el escribador mejorisimo de todo latinoamerica!" her accent was superb, and the lyrical sounds rolled off her tongue like music in her excitement. She pulled her backpack over her shoulder and smiled as she left the group. "See you later," she called over her shoulder as she ran off.</p>
		<p>"Wow, she's something else," Pacey observed after she was out of earshot. "Do you know if she has a boyfriend, Jo?"</p>
		<p>"Always the first question, right Pacey?" Joey teased. She was pretty sure Kaela wasn't seeing anyone, but she didn't like the idea of Pacey going after her. "I couldn't tell you," she answered vaguely. The bell for fourth period rang, and the rest of the group scrambled for class. Dawson pulled Joey aside to an uninhabited corner and kissed her hungrily. She broke it off after a minute, though she didn't want to.</p>
		<p>"Dawson, we'll be late for class," she reminded him as she caught her breath for the second time in an hour.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well I just needed to stock up a little, since I'm going to be doing such 'manly things' all afternoon," Dawson threw at her. Joey leaned into him for one more kiss, pulling on his lip with her teeth.</p>
		<p>"I didn't say anything about after dinner," she whispered mischievously in his ear.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Joey tossed her keys on the kitchen table as she lead Kaela into the house. She usually worried about bringing people to her house for the first time, but she knew Kaela wasn't exactly rich either. Besides, she was so non-judgemental-- Joey just felt comfortable with her.</p>
		<p>"Lucky for us, nobody's home yet," Joey said slyly as she went for the refrigerator. "If you ever come here at night, be prepared to tiptoe." "Don't worry," Kaela said nonchalantly, "I've got a three year old brother and a five year old sister at home, I've been through it all before. I even have a secret weapon that might come in handy for you sometime."</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah?" Joey tried not to sound too curious. "And what might that be?"</p>
		<p>"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot." Kaela grinned sheepishly, taking the orange Joey handed her. "It's simple but effective. No matter how hard a baby is screaming, you just start singing that song, and after a few minutes, they're out like a light. It always works for me-- I'm not sure why. Maybe because there's only one verse, it becomes like a mantra when you sing it over and over." Joey was impressed, and made a mental note that this would be her back-up plan if anything ever happened to the copy of "The English Patient" that Pacey had made for her.</p>
		<p>"It just so happens that I've got a secret weapon of my own," Joey said mysteriously as they went over to the couch.</p>
		<p>"What is it?" Kaela asked, affecting wide-eyed curiosity.</p>
		<p>"This," Joey said as she pulled a fat book out of her backpack. "The Complete Works of Octavio Paz, with English text on opposing pages. That's not cheating, is it?"</p>
		<p>"Not unless we bring it to class," Kaela laughed, flipping the heavy book open on her lap. "Damn, this a lot of reading," she lamented.</p>
		<p>" 'Come on, scaredy-cat,'" Joey mimicked, and they both erupted in laughter as they began their work.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Dawson was lying on his bed reading about the French revolution when Joey came in the window. "Hey," he said happily, "I wasn't sure you'd make it."</p>
		<p>"Dawson, you know I'm not a tease," Joey said pointedly. "I told you I'd come over tonight."</p>
		<p>"Yeah..." he got up on his knees and pulled her onto the bed with him, kissing her and trying to push his history books off the bed at the same time.</p>
		<p>"Wait a minute," Joey said, putting her finger over his lips. "Where are your parents?"</p>
		<p>"Couples therapy," Dawson grinned, "in Boston. They won't be back for at least two more hours."</p>
		<p>"So I can be as loud as I want, and talk dirty to you?" Joey asked seductively, meaning to make a joke but realizing she sort of meant it.</p>
		<p>"Anything you want, Jo," Dawson grinned as she pushed him down on the pillows, leaning over him.</p>
		<p>"If you insist," she whispered, and kissed him like a wild cat. Her body was pressed on top of him, and he ran his hands up her back, under her shirt. He unhooked her bra and she sat up, pulled her arms inside her shirt, and in the magic act that every girl knows, pulled it back out one sleeve, dropping it on the floor with a radiant grin. Then she pulled her shirt off, and Dawson watched her back arch, putting his hands gently on her beautiful breasts. She trembled at his touch, her breath catching slightly as her head went back. Dawson pulled off his own shirt then, greedy for the feel of her skin against his. He went back to kissing her then, moving down her body, tasting her all over, and she moaned softly. After twenty minutes, Joey had nothing left on her body but her underwear, and Dawson had only his boxers.</p>
		<p>"Jo?" Dawson whispered as he took in his first long breath.</p>
		<p>"What?" she answered back, similarly breathless.</p>
		<p>"Do you-- have anything?"</p>
		<p>"No," she said dissapointedly, "I was hoping you did."</p>
		<p>"Oh," Dawson groaned, making a mental note to kick himself in the ass for the rest of the night. After all, it was his-- well, it ought to be his responsibility.</p>
		<p>"It's not like there's nothing else we can do," Joey mused, running her fingers through his hair while she propped herself up with her other arm.</p>
		<p>"Like what?" Dawson asked, wishing he knew what she was thinking without having to ask.</p>
		<p>"Well," Joey steeled herself, "you've got two hands and a tongue, haven't you?" She couldn't believe those words had just come out of her mouth, but there was no going back now.</p>
		<p>"Last time I checked," Dawson said, grinning until his face hurt. He'd never thought Joey could be so forward in bed. He managed to break his smile to kiss her again, his hands pulling off her underwear.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>It was almost midnight when Joey crept back into the house, and though she didn't officially have a curfew, she felt like it would be best to get to her room as uneventfully as possible. She didn't turn on any lights as she tiptoed across the living room, so she didn't notice Bessie nursing Alex on the sofa.</p>
		<p>"Hey," Bessie whispered, hoping not to disturb the baby. Joey gasped and jumped back, nearly crashing into the desk lamp.</p>
		<p>"Jesus, Bessie, you scared me," she whispered back, sighing heavily. "Night of the Living Dead Spawn, huh?" she joked, hoping to keep the attention off her.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, well I'm sitting in here because my baby is hungry. The question of the hour is, where did you just come from?" Bessie's tone was suggestive, and Joey began to feel embarrassed. "Come on, Kiddo, you can tell your big sister. I promise I won't get you in trouble..."</p>
		<p>"Okay Bessie, okay. I was with Dawson, naturally."</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>"...And I had the most amazing orgasm that has ever happened to a human being," Joey admitted blissfully. Bessie hadn't quite been prepared for that much frankness, and put her free hand over her mouth to suppress a shocked giggle.</p>
		<p>"Well well, good for you, Joey! I'll let you in on a little secret: there will be others that will be even better, lots of them." They both laughed quietly then, Joey feeling her embarrassment turn to pride as she sat down on the couch next to Bessie. "So did you use something?" Bessie couldn't help asking.</p>
		<p>"No, Mother, we didn't use anything because we didn't actually have sex." Joey said vaguely.</p>
		<p>"Oh," Bessie nodded, taken aback momentarily. "So...what did you do, if you don't mind my asking?" Joey didn't quite want to say at first, but then she reminded herself that Bessie was her big sister, and if she couldn't tell her, then who could she tell? "We just fooled around a lot for a while, and then he...he went down on me," she said shyly, but glowing. "Wow, you really are growing up fast," Bessie sighed. "I remember all these firsts...it seems like a million years ago now." She shook her head, looking at her not-so-little sister. "I was petrified the first time I did that. Were you scared at all?"</p>
		<p>"For a minute," Joey admitted, "I mean it was basically the most vulnerable I think I can ever be, but that's exactly what made it so amazing. And I knew Dawson wouldn't hurt me, physically or emotionally, so I just gave into it...it was-- I felt like--" she stopped, feeling flustered and unable to find the words she wanted to describe such a visceral experience. "It defied description," she finally said decisively.</p>
		<p>"Well listen, now that you and Dawson are getting so serious, I just want you to know that I'm always here, if you have questions about anything or you just want to talk. I'm not going to try to give you a whole lot of rules about what you can and can't do, just use your head. I trust that you don't intend on making me an aunt anytime soon," Bessie finished, attempting to sound at least a little stern but basically failing.</p>
		<p>"Not in the least," Joey assured her, and kissed her good night. She picked up her backpack and gave sleeping Alex a light kiss on the top of the head. Making her way through the ribbons of moonlight to her own room, she fell asleep in her clothes the second her head hit the pillow.</p>
