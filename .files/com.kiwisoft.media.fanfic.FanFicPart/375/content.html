<p align="center"><i>Don't let yourself be hurt this time<br>Don't let yourself be hurt this time</i></p>

	<p>I hate the way I have to watch everything I do and say around her. I
	hate the way I can't talk to her about anything. I hate that she
	can do such evil things to me, I hate that she can hurt me without
	even blinking an eye. But the most I hate the way my world starts to
	spin when she walks into the room. No, actually I love that. I love
	the queezy feeling I get whenever she's there. I love the way I
	can look at her for the longest of times and not figure her out. I
	love the way she is sometimes so consumed in the things she does,
	that she doesn't even know I'm around. And at the same time
	I'm hurt by that. It's a huge blow to my ego. Everyone HAS to
	notice me when I'm around! It's like a rule.</p>

	<p>"What the hell are you looking at?", she asks whenever she
	catches me ogling her way.</p>

	<p>And I'm always startled. And I begin to stutter and mumble
	incoherently, and she will shake her head and throw some wicked
	comment at me. And I feel this burning rage invade my body, it
	replaces the mushy feelings. And I swear to myself I'll never
	ever again look at her. Think about her. Love her.</p>

	<p align="center"><i>Then I saw your face<br>Then I saw your smile</i></p>

	<p>And then after a time I'll see her again. The rage has passed and
	everything's the way it was. And sometimes when she's in a
	good mood she'll smile at me. And I almost faint. When she's
	in a good mood, she doesn't insult me even when I do something
	stupid. Sometimes she'll even apologize for an earlier incident. </p>

	<p>One morning she walked into the kitchen, smiled and said,
	"Morning Brooke." I tried to reply, but only managed to drop
	my coffee mug. And she started to laugh. But she wasn't laughing
	at me. She was just laughing. And so I smiled back. </p>

	<p>"Are you okay Brooke?", she asked after a minute. </p>

	<p>I was cleaning the floor and looked up at her. She was standing only
	a few feet away, "Sure. Why do you ask?"</p>

	<p>"Cause lately it seems you've been... I don't know,
	distracted or something. You are always fumbling and stumbling
	around."</p>

	<p>It was so sweet. Sam was actually worried about my well being. I
	think my heart almost exploded at that moment. I smiled and
	nodded, "I'm fine", and she smiled back. It was the
	second smile that day. Fourth that week and fifteenth all together.
	If you only count the real smiles, and not the smirks or the mock
	ones.</p>

	<p align="center"><i>The sky is still blue<br>The clouds come and go<br>Yet something is different<br>Are we falling in love?</i></p>

	<p>Those are the times I live for. It is unbelievable how good I feel.
	One smile and I'll be on the top of the world for the rest of the
	day. And what a world it is! Full of beautiful things I didn't
	see the day before. And yet they were there, I just missed them.</p>

	<p>Take the cheer leading practice for example. It is so much fun
	sometimes, just listening to Nicole boss around the others. Screaming
	at them when they make mistakes, or just watching her storm away when
	she gets really mad about something. Usually at Mary Cherry. That
	girl can't dance to save her life. And usually I'm as mad
	about it as Nicole, cause it's almost as if she doesn't even
	try her best. </p>

	<p>But on the good days, I don't care. It's just a stupid cheer
	leading team. She smiled at me, so who cares about cheer leading?
	It's actually kind of funny watching MC fall on her ass all the
	time.</p>

	<p>But Nicole cares. Sometimes she corners me in the locker room and
	demands answers, "I don't know what you're talking about
	Nic. Can't a girl feel good once in a while?"</p>

	<p>"No", oh yeah. I was talking to Nicole. She doesn't feel
	good unless someone else is feeling like shit, "Not without a
	reason."</p>

	<p>And if I'm feeling especially high on love, I'm tempted to
	tell her. What does it matter who knows, as long as she still smiles
	at me? </p>

	<p>"I'm falling in love", I told her once.</p>

	<p>She was kinda shocked at first, "With who?", cause she
	hadn't seen me with anyone. Not after I broke up with Josh.</p>

	<p>"I can't tell you yet", I answered and left it to that.</p>

	<p>Now she keeps pestering me about it almost every day.</p>

	<p align="center"><i>Don't let yourself be hurt this time<br>
	Don't let yourself be hurt this time</i></p>

	<p>But I can't tell anyone. Not yet. Cause this thing is so
	delicate. One false move and it's gona crumble to dust. Sometimes
	I'm too scared to even breathe. What if she won't feel the
	same? What if she'll be appalled? Then I'll end up
	destroying, not only my life, but a few others around me as well. I
	wouldn't survive that. Not without her smile.</p>

	<p>I'm not that strong. If she hurts me, really hurts me, then
	I'll break into millions of pieces. And I'm still scared
	she'll hurt me. She sometimes does. She ignores me sometimes, and
	that hurts the most. If she loved me, she wouldn't be able to
	ignore me. Ever. That's why I can't tell her, or Nicole. Not
	yet. I have to be sure.</p>

	<p>Dad and Jane are starting to think I'm manic-depressive. Cause in
	my more cranky moods, I'll just sulk in my room, or lie on the
	couch and watch stupid tv-shows. And then on my better moods I'll
	be cooking dinner and laughing and joking with the best of them. Dad
	actually suggested yesterday that I go see a shrink. It was a bad
	day, so I told him to get a life and stop bothering me. And then I
	slammed the door to his face and went to bed.</p>

	<p align="center"><i>Then your kiss so soft<br>Then your touch so warm</i></p>

	<p>And now today I'm walking down the stairs and she appears from
	out of nowhere. She smiles and says, "Hi Brooke. Wanna watch a
	video with me?", and before I know it, she's standing right
	next to me.</p>

	<p>Oh my God! SHE wants to watch a video with me!, "Sure
	Sam...", I answer and forget I'm in the stairs. I only see
	her smile. And when I take the next step the floor isn't where I
	expect it to be. And I trip and I fall. Only I don't, because she
	has reached out and stopped me from falling.</p>

	<p>"Hey", she says and steadies me with a firm hold, "You
	gotta be more careful."</p>

	<p>One of her hands is holding me by my right arm. And her touch is like
	heaven. It is strong but still so delicate, so warm. So caring. I
	don't want her to ever let go. I look at her hand and then I turn
	my head and I look at her face. Her mouth is mere inches from mine. I
	could just... lean closer and kiss her. And she would kiss me back. I
	try to imagine how it would feel. How it would taste. Would it be
	soft and tender, like her touch? Or intense and passionate, like her
	temper? Or maybe both, or maybe neither. All I need to do is lean
	closer. But I don't. I just keep staring at her lips, making her
	feel uncomfortable.</p>

	<p>She let's go of my arm and starts descending the stairs, "You
	coming?"</p>

	<p>But in my head she's still kissing me. And she won't ever
	stop. Because in my head, she loves me.</p>

	<p align="center"><i>The stars still shine bright<br>
	The mountains still high<br>
	Yet something is different<br>
	Are we falling in love?</i></p>

	<p>I must've seen Pretty Woman a hundred times before, and every
	time I've loved it. But this time it's different. This time I
	hate it. Because she hates it too, "Yeah, you're so right
	Sam. She doesn't deserve him."</p>

	<p>And the girl turns to look at me and frowns, "No, Brooke, I said
	HE doesn't deserve HER."</p>

	<p>Yeah but.. she's a hooker and he's a millionaire.. oh
	whatever, "Oh yeah, definitely. That's what I meant."</p>

	<p>She looks at me a little while longer and then shakes her head,
	"What is wrong with you?", she asks.</p>

	<p>"What?", I say a little confused, "I said you were
	right?"</p>

	<p>"Yeah, exactly. I've been right about everything for the past
	two hours."</p>

	<p>Yeah, cause you're so smart. And pretty. I suddenly develop a
	keen interest to the end credits, "No you haven't", I
	answer. That's what she wants to hear.</p>

	<p>"Name one thing", she challenges me. I want so badly to just
	turn my head and look at her. She must look so adorable right now.
	With that cocky look about her.</p>

	<p>"Well.. uhm..", think silly girl. There has to be something,
	"This thing right here", I finally say and grin at the tv.</p>

	<p>"What?"</p>

	<p>Now it's safe to turn. I've gotten her confused. She's
	frowning again, "This. You said you've been right about
	everything, and I said no, you haven't."</p>

	<p>She looks at me for a few seconds and then groans, "That is SO
	lame Brooke!", she picks up a pillow and throws it at me. And
	she's laughing. And I'm floating on air. I have never been
	happier, I have never loved anything this much.</p>

	<p align="center"><i>Falling, falling,<br>
		Falling, falling,<br>
		In love</i></p>

	<p>I am so madly in love with her, someone is bound to notice it sooner
	or later. I have to tell her first. I have to tell her now. Just
	knock on the door and go tell her. But what if... what if she
	doesn't want to know? What if this is what she wants? This weird
	game of fighting and bonding, with each event given their proper
	time. This game that is killing me. I can't stand it much longer.
	An emotional roller coaster, that's what it is. I don't think
	I can survive another plunge to the depths. Not after today. So just
	knock already.</p>

	<p>I'm standing in front of her door with my right hand up and
	curled into a fist, ready to knock. And that's when Jane walks up
	from behind me. I must be quite the sight, "Hey Brooke", she
	says and my heart almost jumps up my throat, "What are you
	doing?"</p>

	<p>"I'm...", huh boy. I wonder if there is a single soul in
	this world who still thinks I'm sane, "Ehh.. going to
	bed", I say and quickly turn to leave.</p>

	<p>"Okay.. goodnight", she calls after me.</p>

	<p>Yeah, goodnight. I walk into my room and close the door. I am so
	pathetic, it isn't even funny anymore. I have to tell her. So I
	walk into the bathroom and up to her door. Again I raise my hand to
	knock... and something stops me. I am SO pathetic. And so gutless. I
	can't do it. I can't knock on the door. What if she's in
	a bad mood? Then she definitely don't wanna hear it. Maybe I
	should just wait till tomorrow.. see how she's feeling and then
	tell her.</p>

	<p>Yeah, I'll tell her tomorrow. Tomorrow's a good day to start
	a new life.</p>

	<p align="center"><i>Falling, falling,<br>
	Falling, falling,<br>
	In love</i></p>

	<p>I turn and walk back into my room, only to find her in there,
	"Mom said you wanted to talk to me?", oh.. did I? No, she
	must've made a mistake. I didn't say anything like that.</p>

	<p>But she's smiling at me once again. Number twenty-six. She's
	been doing it a lot lately. Maybe.. maybe she doesn't want to
	fight anymore either. Maybe she's feeling exactly the way I am.
	She might be just waiting for a sign from me. Or she might be
	gathering up her nerve just the way I am. I so want to believe that.
	I so want things to change. So I'll just tell her. Right now. And
	she'll... she'll do whatever she wants. And I'll live
	with that. So.. just tell her. Today's the day, not tomorrow.</p>

	<p>"Sam..", I say and the world starts to spin. I fix my eyes on
	her. And she starts to spin with the world. But I keep my eyes on
	her, and she is the only thing I can make out, everything else is a
	blur, "I'm falling in love with you."</p>
