<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 3 -->

<p>Seven awoke from her regeneration cycle and a smile immediately graced her features as her eidetic memory replayed the events of last evening.  The chief engineer's smile, the sound of her laughter, the touch of her hand on Seven's body all flitted through her mind, making her happy.  She decided to take a chance on running into B'Elanna in the mess hall and so she headed out quickly to the turbolift.  To her delight the Klingon hybrid was eating her breakfast when Seven entered the room, but her heart fell when she saw that she was sharing a table with Lieutenant Paris.  She retrieved her nutritional supplement and debated whether or not she should approach their table.  Neither of them looked up or appeared to notice her presence so she decided that she should not intrude.  She took a seat across the room, one with an unimpeded view of B'Elanna.  She watched as the beautiful brunette smiled at one of Tom's jokes and suddenly her meal turned to ashes in her mouth.  The happy mood she had been floating on seemed to drain away like water, and suddenly she felt alone again.  She finished her drink quickly and left for her duty shift. She caught B'Elanna's eye as she moved toward the doors, but she couldn't bring herself to acknowledge the Klingon's look; she just wanted to be far away from the image of the engineer and the flight controller eating together.</p>

		<p>As Seven exited the room Tom looked up and noticed that she had been there.  He couldn't resist a quick poke at B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"Well, I see your new best friend couldn't wait to get out of here.  I'm surprised she didn't want to have breakfast with you Lanna."</p>

		<p>"Give it a rest Tom.  She's not so bad once you get to know her."</p>

		<p>"Right, that's why she rushed over here to have breakfast with you."</p>

		<p>"Jump to conclusions much Tom?  She could have been in a hurry, or maybe she just didn't want to have breakfast with you."  </p>

		<p>B'Elanna was angry with Tom for his incessant harping on her conflicted relationship with Seven.  She also hated to admit that she was a little hurt that Seven hadn't even said 'hello' this morning, or acknowledged her smile after things had gone so well last night.  She shook her head...it shouldn't matter to her whether Seven said good morning or not, two days ago she would have traded all of her replicator rations if someone could have promised her that the former drone would never speak to her again.  So why did it matter so much all of a sudden?  B'Elanna didn't have time to worry about it; there was work to complete in Engineering.  She rose abruptly and left a smirking Tom Paris to finish his breakfast alone-again.</p>

		<p>Everyone in engineering could tell that the Chief was in a foul mood from the second she strode through the doors to the department.  She was caustic and short with everyone, but it wasn't until she nearly tore Vorik's head off for being unable to complete a simple repair quickly enough that B'Elanna herself realized that there was a problem.  She apologized to an impassive Vorik and went to her office to catch up on her paperwork and spare her coworkers her foul mood.  She had already missed lunch and it was well past the end of her shift when she finally stopped working and allowed herself to examine her mood. To her surprise she realized that she was indeed upset about Seven not even giving her the time of day this morning in the messhall.  She felt a surge of irritation that it seemed to matter so much to her, but still, there was no denying that it did.  Never one to avoid a problem, B'Elanna left her office and made her way up to Astrometrics to confront Seven of Nine.  Even though the Gamma shift was long over B'Elanna wasn't surprised to find the former Borg still working away alone. </p>

		<p>"Hey," she said as she entered Seven's domain.</p>

		<p>The younger woman looked up at B'Elanna's greeting and the smile that spread over her face wiped away the foul mood that had been haunting the engineer all day.  </p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," she replied in her carefully modulated tones.</p>

		<p>"I was...uh..." B'Elanna was suddenly ill at ease.  She had come here for a confrontation and now the mere sight of Seven's genuine smile had taken the wind completely out of her sails.  "Do you want to have dinner? I mean if you haven't already eaten."  The words were out before the Klingon even knew what she was saying.  </p>

		<p>"I would like that very much." Seven's normally impassive face was suffused with colour.  She couldn't believe that B'Elanna was seeking out her company.  It was more than she could have hoped for in her wildest imaginings.  Never in her life had she felt such a mixture of emotions, joy, fear, happiness and trepidation coursed through her body nearly causing her cortical node to malfunction as it worked to keep up with the welter of intense feelings Seven was experiencing.  Without another word Seven shut down her workstation and logged off for the evening.</p>

		<p>When they reached the turbolift B'Elanna ordered it to the messhall, and then realized that she really didn't want Tom to see her having dinner with Seven.  She just didn't want to see the look of amusement on his face when he saw them together, especially after his comments at breakfast.  She told the computer to belay her first command and then ordered the lift to her own deck.  Seven was surprised that B'Elanna was taking her to her personal quarters but the joy she felt at the prospect of having the engineer all to herself quickly washed away all other thoughts.</p>

		<p>As they made their way to her quarters B'Elanna found herself growing more and more confused.  Although she did the emotion 'angry' very well, when it came to the rest of the emotional spectrum she was more childlike than she cared to admit, even to herself.  She had known little joy in her life, had few friendships, was rarely happy and wasn't certain that she really knew what love was despite her relationship with Tom Paris.  So it was that she wasn't able to settle into a feeling state now.  She still felt hurt at Seven's apparent disregard for her this morning.  She felt as though her new friend had rejected her and her offer of friendship out of hand, but the former Drone's behaviour this evening would seem to belie that fact.  B'Elanna was uncomfortable with her confusion and so she lapsed into sullen silence.  When they reached her quarters she motioned Seven inside and began the preparations for dinner without a word.</p>

		<p>Seven stood in the centre of B'Elanna's living room and found that she didn't know what to do with herself.  She wanted to look around the Klingon's well-ordered living space, but she was afraid of invoking the engineer's ire if her interest was mistaken for snooping.  So she merely stood in place and watched as B'Elanna worked.  She could sense that the Klingon-hybrid was becoming increasingly agitated and she was worried that she had unwittingly angered the dark-haired woman.  </p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," she finally mustered up the courage to speak.  "If you would prefer that I go...I will comply," she finished softly.</p>

		<p>"No one's keeping you here Seven.  If you want to go just go."  B'Elanna felt the comfortable blanket of her anger wrapping itself protectively around her as she interpreted Seven's question as a statement of desire.</p>

		<p>"I do not wish to go, but it seems that you are uncomfortable with my presence here and I do not wish to make you angry."  Seven stopped, unsure of how to explain her feelings.</p>

		<p>The two women stood facing one another, their confusion and hurt building a wall between them.  Finally it was B'Elanna who bridged the gap.</p>

		<p>"Why didn't you say hello to me this morning in the mess hall?"</p>

		<p>Whatever Seven had been expecting it hadn't been this.</p>

		<p>"I...you were having breakfast with Lieutenant Paris.  I did not think you would welcome my intrusion.  I apologize if I hurt your feelings or offended in any way.  It was not my intention to do so."</p>

		<p>Now it was B'Elanna's turn to be surprised.  She was unable to formulate a reply and simply stood staring at the concerned face of Seven of Nine.  Seven took the engineer's silent look to be one of anger or disbelief and so she hung her head and walked toward the doors of the cabin.  When the sensors activated and the doors slid open she paused.</p>

		<p>"You should know B'Elanna that I would never do anything to intentionally hurt you."  She was about to leave when the voice of the Klingon stopped her in her tracks.</p>

		<p>"Wait!"  </p>

		<p>Seven's heartfelt words made B'Elanna feel a sharp pang of remorse.  She wasn't used to dealing with other people's emotions like this, and Seven's inexperience was exacerbating their communication difficulty.  B'Elanna realized it was up to her to clarify the situation before she lost someone she was coming to consider a friend.</p>

		<p>"Look Seven...I'm sorry I'm being so prickly with you today.  The truth is I'm feeling a little out of my depth here.  I...I've never really done this kind of thing before.  I guess after last night I thought we were becoming friends, and so this morning I got my feelings hurt when you didn't even acknowledge my existance..."</p>

		<p>"So you decided to push me away before you were further hurt by my perceived rejection of your friendship," Seven interrupted.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was taken aback by Seven's razor sharp incite, and frankly she didn't like the image it evoked of her as a frightened child, but she had to admit that the former drone was correct.</p>

		<p>"Yeah...something like that," she muttered.  "Something exactly like that.  Seven I'm sorry."</p>

		<p>"There is no need for you to apologize.  I should have said something to you this morning when I realized you had seen me.  I simply didn't want to interrupt your time with Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>"My friends are always welcome at my table," B'Elanna declared.  </p>

		<p>She was rewarded for her words with another of Seven's brilliant smiles.  She found herself breaking into an answering grin.</p>

		<p>"Alright, enough of this sentimental nonsense, I'm starving."  B'Elanna's voice was gruff but Seven could tell by the laughter in her eyes that she was only teasing.</p>

		<p>The mood between the two of them was much more relaxed as B'Elanna returned to the kitchen and continued with her dinner preparations.  Seven felt sufficiently at ease to wander around the Klingon's quarters and observe the sparse decorations that B'Elanna had placed in her rooms.  When they finally sat down to eat it was as if their misunderstanding had never occurred and B'Elanna found herself laughing at Seven's deadpan imitations of various crewmembers.  She couldn't remember when she had felt so relaxed or had so much fun.  Later that night she would remember this observation with a tinge of sadness when she realized that Tom seldom made her laugh like that, or spent so much uninterrupted time alone with her outside of the holodeck.</p>
