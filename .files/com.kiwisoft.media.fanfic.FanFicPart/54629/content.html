<!-- Bound \ Chapter 2 - Just Good Friends -->

<P>It was the change-over for the alpha and beta shifts and the mess hall was bustling with crewmembers. Tom and B'Elanna sat at a table, talking and joking as they ate their meal. Seven walked into the mess hall and looked round, she knew that Torres was there and wanted to spend some time with her. It had been several months since they had decided to bury the hatchet and they had genuinely become friends. Seven had come to enjoy the times that they spent working together on various projects and she had come to respect and admire the half-Klingon even more than she thought possible. She had a new perspective on how the engineer thought and worked and was constantly amazed at how much effort B'Elanna put in to get the engines running smoothly. Seven had not had the opportunity to see B'Elanna over the past few days, due to work and other commitments and she found that she missed her company. To her shame Seven found that she also missed her fights with the chief engineer. She was at a loss to understand why, but she enjoyed the sensations of watching the Klingon temper bubble over as it frequently did in their past dealings. There was something about the way B'Elanna's eyes darkened to black and how her respiration increased by 6% and her body temperature by 18.75% that fascinated Seven. Or perhaps it was the sound of her twin hearts pounding, then of course there was that ever so subtle, but to Seven, with her acute sense of smell, distinctive and exquisite scent that B'Elanna gave off anytime she lost her rag that made Seven feel, feel exhilarated, alive, something. And she wanted to feel it again but not at the expense of her new relationship with the engineer. She looked round and immediately saw the object of her (desire) thoughts eating with her ex-husband.</P>
<I><P>They looked comfortable together and they made a very handsome couple. Could they be planning reconciliation? B'Elanna should know that Lieutenant Paris is not a fit mate for her. Why would she consider returning to him?</P>
</I><P>The thoughts tumbled through Seven's brain for a second before logic kicked in. Tom and B'Elanna acknowledged their mistakes and returned to their easy friendship of old. Sharing a meal did not constitute a romantic reconciliation. <I>Even if it did, why should that bother you?</I> Seven decided to ignore the question that popped into her head and retrieve a tray of nutritional supplements.</P>
<P>Just as she was about to make her way over to her friends the Captain strolled in and beckoned to Seven to join her.</P>
<I><P>Rats</I>. Seven thought as she changed direction and joined Janeway. She then frowned and made a mental note to stop picking up juvenile terms from Tom Paris.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"So, how's your new best friend working out? Fucked her yet?" Tom asked the question casually as her chewed on his meal. He grinned at the extremely evil glare that his ex-wife aimed at him and patted her back politely as she got over her choking fit.</P>
<P>"You are a crude and nasty bastard, Tom," B'Elanna croaked out. "Why the sam hill would you ask such a question?"</P>
<P>"Oh, come on Lanna, we both know what your libido's like and Seven's probably one of the few people on the ship that could actually handle you when you get that old bloodlust thing." Tom leaned back in his seat and smiled knowingly.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked down at her plate pensively. "I wasn't always like that, I was gentle as well."</P>
<P>Tom quickly leaned forward and stoked her hand. "Hey, come on, I'm only kidding, you were always gentle with me," he smiled self-deprecatingly, " I guess that why you fought so much with Seven, you had to get rid of some of that energy somehow."</P>
<P>B'Elanna blinked. That actually made some sense.</P>
<P>"So since you guys aren't fighting anymore, I figured that you must be fingering each other."</P>
<P>B'Elanna closed her eyes at Tom's crudity. Then snapped them open again and pinned him with her stare.</P>
<P>"Are you having me on?" she was perplexed at the conversation. </P>
<P>"Well, not really," he replied, his mouth full. "Why? it's not against regulations or anything."</P>
<P>B'Elanna could feel herself starting to blush and kept her eyes fixed on her plate.</P>
<P>"But she's a girl."</P>
<P> </P>
<P>"Darling, I noticed."</P>
<P>"I've never been with a woman before, I've never even considered it an option."</P>
<P>"Well, it's a thought. You know what you're like, you won't use the holodeck, you won't have casual sex, you need a long-term partner. It's either that or learning Vulcan meditation. I know which option I'd choose."</P>
<P>"Yeah, fine but why Seven, why a girl?"</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, when you decided to end the feud with Seven, there was a massive sweepstakes to see how long it would last. You are the most impatient, impulsive, quick-tempered, mercurial person I know. Not one single person thought that you would be able to tolerate Seven, who we know to be an arrogant, condescending, difficult and perfect little drone. But you did it, six, seven months later you guys are still good friends, to everyone's surprise. You sing her praises, you support her, you help her out and she does the same for you. If you can be such a good friend, why not lover?"</P>
<P>"She isn't any of those things, not really, you've just got to get to know her, that's all," B'Elanna muttered. She was still blushing and staring at the table.</P>
<P>"Well, you've obviously got to know her, you care about her. The emotions are already there."</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked up to make sure that no one could overhear their conversation, as she did, she saw Seven talking to the Captain. Strangely, at that very moment Seven turned to look right back at her. Neither smiled, a mere nod of the head from Seven, B'Elanna dropped her eyes and blushed like it was going out of fashion.</P>
<P>"I hate you, Tom, how am I going to be able to look her in the eye after this?" she wailed. A thought occurred to her. " Would you ever consider, you know, doing it with another man?"</P>
<P>Tom dropped his fork and paled slightly at the question. "No way."</P>
<P>"Why is it ok for me to be with another woman, but you wouldn't consider a man? What's wrong with Harry?"</P>
<P>Tom paled some more. "Please don't put that image in my head, Harry's a friend." He recovered somewhat. "Anyway, I've got all the pussy I can handle right here," he grinned and gestured to the busy mess hall.</P>
<P>B'Elanna frowned. "I wish you wouldn't be so crude."</P>
<P>Tom leaned forward and picked up her hand, "B'Elanna, I'm not as discriminating as you, you don't do things in half measures, you need someone who's in it for the long haul, I wasn't. Seriously, Seven might be the one for you. And when you do finally get it on, please let me watch."</P>
<P>Several heads turned as Tom yelped in pain at the extremely hard knock he received in the chest courtesy of the chief engineer.</P>
<P>The Captain smiled indulgently at the antics of B'Elanna and Tom. "I'm glad that those two sorted out their differences," she commented as she chewed on her chicken salad.</P>
<P>"Indeed," Seven was thinking, why had B'Elanna blushed when their eyes met a few moments ago?</P>
<P>"Talking of settling differences, I must commend you for the way in which both you and B'Elanna have worked things out. I would have given you both commendations but Tuvok overruled me on that one." Kathryn grinned.</P>
<P>"To be honest, Captain, your praise should go to B'Elanna. It was she who made all the attempts to cease hostilities between us. She apologised for her previous behaviour and explained her reasons for it. I would not have known how to resolve our difficulties if she had not done so herself." Seven had been sworn to secrecy over the talk they had all those months ago, but she was pleased to be able to let the Captain know how much B'Elanna had changed.</P>
<P>"Well, whoever, was responsible, you both have displayed great maturity and courage and I'm proud of you both."</P>
<P>Seven looked earnestly at the Captain, " It would mean a lot to B'Elanna if you told her that. Your approval means everything to her, you are..." recalling the only half-jesting threat of broken legs and grievous bodily damage, Seven reigned herself in.</P>
<P>"I believe it would be beneficial to her well-being," she continued, more formally.</P>
<P>Kathryn eyed the beautiful young woman in front of her and wondered what she had been about to say. She had never really acknowledged it to herself, but Seven and the prickly, hostile little engineer were like the daughters she never had. It had hurt her that they never seemed to bury their differences except in times of trouble and crises and now that they had actually become friends, it made her heart overflow. But as Captain she couldn't really show those kinds of emotions.</P>
<P>"I'll keep that in mind," she smiled.</P>
