<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 22 -->

<p>Harry and the others saw B'Elanna leaving the arena with the King and several of his men at arms.  Icy fear gripped their hearts as they realized what this could possibly mean.  Harry wanted to follow the departing group and find out what was happening, to protect his friend if he could, but he knew that his first duty was to protect Annika.  If their deception had been discovered then B'Elanna's life was forfeit and there was nothing he could do to change that.  He would gladly die with his friend but he had long ago promised B'Elanna that if anything ever happened to her that he would ensure that Annika was safe and cared for no matter what.  He fought back tears as he saw his best friend disappear around the corner of the arena and turned to Annika.</p>
<p>"My Lady, we must get you out of here.  It may no longer be safe for you in London."</p>
<p>"I am not leaving B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"If she has been discovered then there is nothing that we can do to change her fate.  I once promised her that I would protect your life with my own if need be and that is just what I intend to do.  You and I are leaving London immediately.  As soon as we are safely away I'll try to find out what is happening with B'Elanna and get word to you."</p>
<p>"If it is B'Elanna's fate to die in this god forsaken town then I will share that fate.  The vows we made to one another on our wedding day demand no less."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Annika, but I made a promise to B'Elanna and I intend to keep it."</p>
<p>They were at an impasse with neither one willing to budge when Sarah spoke up quietly.</p>
<p>"Perhaps we are being a bit hasty in our judgment here.  The King and his men could simply be discussing the tournament with B'Elanna.  I agree there may be cause for alarm, but I think we can find some middle ground.  If things have gone ill then we should not return to our tent just yet, but perhaps if you and Annika just disappear into the city for a few hours while I try to find out what is happening we will find that there is no cause for concern.  Meet me at the Laughing Donkey Inn in two hours and I will tell you what I can find out."</p>
<p>"No Sarah, it is too dangerous for you to stay here if our secret has been discovered," Harry protested.</p>
<p>"I don't think I'll be recognized as one of the group since nobody really knows me yet.  I'll be careful.  I know you have to keep your vow to B'Elanna, let me help you to do so."</p>
<p>Harry knew that Sarah was right; she had the best chance of anyone to gather information about what was happening without being recognized as part of B'Elanna's retinue.  For once the fact that people never really took notice of women was going to play in their favour.  She kissed Harry soundly and threw her arms around Annika.</p>
<p>"Try not to worry.  It may be nothing yet. Perhaps we'll all have a good laugh about this tonight at the Inn."</p>
<p>Annika nodded as she fought back tears.  She prayed to anyone who would listen that B'Elanna be all right, and she agreed to go along with the plan for now, but if B'Elanna had been discovered and her life was in danger there was no power on earth that would stop Annika from being by her wife's side and sharing in her punishment.  </p>
<p>They parted ways; Harry kept glancing over his shoulder to keep an eye on Sarah for as long as he could, but eventually he lost her figure in the crowd.  He knew he couldn't take Goliath back to the stables as the authorities might be there waiting for him, but neither could he ride the spirited destrier.  He contented himself with leading the animal through the streets and stabling him beside the Inn.  They went inside, took a table in the back and sat to wait.</p>
<p>Sarah was nervous at finding herself alone among all these strangers.  Her entire life had been lived with a small group of people who loved her and watched over her well being.  She loved Harry and trusted his friends and that had made it possible for her to leave the village and choose to live a life on the road with her new family.  Every face she looked at now that she was completely alone for the first time seemed sinister; she felt that everyone was looking at her and that they wished her ill.  She swallowed nervously and forced her feet to follow the path that B'Elanna and the King had taken.  She knew that Harry loved B'Elanna as though she was his sister, and so she was determined not to let him down in this.  She couldn't see B'Elanna anywhere so she was forced to wander about the tournament grounds in hopes of gaining some clue as to where she may have been taken.  Finally she realized that she could wander around like this for hours and come no closer to discovering where B'Elanna was being held.  More direct action would be required. She took a look around and found what she needed almost immediately.</p>
<p>"My Lord, could you tell me where I might go to catch a glimpse of the King.  I missed seeing him at the ceremony and I do so want to gaze upon his face before I return to Eastcheap." She looked up through her eyelashes at the older man she had recognized as one of the King's soldiers.  She knew he would believe that she was merely a peasant girl who wanted to say that she had seen the King and so he didn't see the harm in a little flirtation before he took her to the tent where he knew the King to be.</p>
<p>The man touched her face with his roughened hands as he asked her name and inquired as to where she lived. Sarah forced herself to be still and answer his questions, making up the answers as she went.  She smiled up at the soldier, and was gratified to see him smile in return.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose there'd be any harm in letting you see his Majesty.  Come with me little one."</p>
<p>Sarah followed the knight, happy that he seemed not to suspect that she might have an ulterior motive for her request.  He led her to a tent that was draped with the royal colours.  Knights and servants were coming and going quickly.  The large tent seemed to be a hive of activity and Sarah realized that the King must have been staying here with the royal guards throughout the tournament.  The stranger who had agreed to help her led her over to the left side of the tent where she could see through the open flaps to the table where the King sat deep in conversation with several of his soldiers.  To her surprise she saw B'Elanna sitting at the table and talking with them; Sarah couldn't be certain but it didn't look to her like B'Elanna was in any immediate danger.  She relaxed further when she saw B'Elanna take a drink from a goblet that was set in front of her.  Surely they wouldn't be eating and drinking with her if they had discovered her secret.  Still, Sarah wasn't about to leave until she was positive.  She turned to her guide with an engaging smile and began to spin a tale about how thrilled her brother would be when she returned home with the news that she had looked upon the face of their King.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>When B'Elanna heard the King ask if he could have a word with her she felt her heart stop beating in her chest.  The fact that he was standing with the man she had defeated in battle not once but twice caused her blood to run cold in her veins.  Perhaps, embittered by his defeat at her hands he had examined her letters of nobility and discovered her deception.  </p>
<p>She glanced over her shoulder and saw Annika and the others staring at her retreating form.  She knew they would be terribly worried about what was happening to her, but she hoped Harry would be smart enough to get Annika to safety and leave her to face her fate alone.</p>
<p>"I believe you've met John, the Duke of Gloucester," the King said by way of introduction after they had exited the jousting arena.</p>
<p>"Yes, twice actually," B'Elanna smiled. She may be in trouble but she wasn't going down without a fight and she certainly wasn't about to let them see her fear.  To her surprise both the King and the Duke laughed at her remark.  Perhaps her deception had not yet been discovered, but if not, what could the King possibly want with her.</p>
<p>"It was a remarkable performance for one such as yourself," the King remarked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's heart clutched in fear at his words.  So her deception had been discovered after all.  She squared her shoulders and determined to die with honour.  'Please Harry get her to safety and take care of her,' she offered up a silent prayer.</p>
<p>"It isn't often that a tournament knight can so soundly defeat one of my best soldiers in not one but two events.  You have remarkable skill Lord Beyla," King Henry continued.</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her heart begin to beat again.  She was beginning to believe that the King had no idea she was not who she claimed to be.</p>
<p>"Skills such as your own go to waste in the tournaments.  Especially when your country is at war," he admonished.  </p>
<p>They had, by now, reached the royal tent where the King was staying with his men for the duration of the tournament.  He pulled aside the flap and motioned that they should all go inside.  Once they were seated around the table a serving girl brought mead and meat for all of them.  B'Elanna sat back in her chair and waited to see what the King had to say.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>When B'Elanna exited the King's tent an hour later she was surprised to see Sarah standing and chatting with one of the royal soldiers.  Upon seeing B'Elanna walk out of the tent alone Sarah quickly thanked her unwitting guide and left in a different direction than the one B'Elanna had taken.  She was fairly certain that there was nothing to worry about but she was taking no chances.  Once she was certain she was out of sight of the soldiers she turned around and circled widely back to catch up with B'Elanna as she walked.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla!" she called.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stopped and turned around, waiting until Sarah caught up with her.</p>
<p>"Are you all right my Lord?" she inquired when she was at B'Elanna's side.</p>
<p>"Sarah, yes I'm fine.  What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"We saw you leaving with the King and we feared the worst.  I was looking for you to see if I could find out what was happening."</p>
<p>"Where are the others?  Is Annika all right?"</p>
<p>"I was to gather what information I could and meet them at an inn in two hours.  They are waiting there for me now.  I'll take you to them."</p>
<p>"Thank you Sarah."</p>
<p>"Neither Annika nor Harry wanted to leave you.  They will both be sick with worry," she informed.</p>
<p>"Then we'd better hurry."</p>
<p>They walked swiftly through the streets.  Sarah desperately wanted to ask what had transpired between B'Elanna and the King but since the dark-haired woman hadn't offered any explanation she didn't feel it was her place to pry.  She was simply glad that everything seemed to be fine.  She had to trot to keep up with B'Elanna, who was in a terrible hurry to reach the inn and allay Annika's fears.  </p>
<p>Annika and the others were sitting at the back of the crowded Inn.  Annika had to constantly wipe the tears from her eyes as she fretted over what was happening to her wife.  She knew that B'Elanna was the other half of her soul; she couldn't bear the thought of living without the fierce warrior by her side.  Every time the door opened her heart leapt into her throat.  Harry had brought her a drink of mead to calm her nerves but she was unable to take even a single sip.  At first Harry had tried to cheer her up with words of comfort, but soon enough they all fell silent as they kept their vigil.  A shaft of sunlight fell over their table as the door was opened and Annika looked up quickly.  She leapt to her feet at the sight of B'Elanna coming through the door.  In two quick strides the raven-haired woman was at her side and she felt herself pulled into strong arms.  She kissed her passionately as tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>"My Lord I thought I'd lost you," she sobbed at last.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry you went through this Annika my love, but everything is fine.  I'm here now?everything is all right." </p>
<p>Annika allowed B'Elanna to bear her weight and comfort her.  She held on as tight as she could pressing their bodies close despite the fact that B'Elanna still wore her armour.  After some time had passed they realized that they were making quite a scene in the normally quiet inn and so they quickly decided to leave and return to the camp.  Harry and Sarah went to get Goliath leaving Annika and B'Elanna alone to talk.</p>
<p>"What did they want with you?" Annika inquired still trying to calm her breathing.</p>
<p>"Nothing really," B'Elanna replied.  "They just wanted to discuss the tournament."</p>
<p>Annika had the uncomfortable feeling that B'Elanna wasn't being entirely truthful with her, but she knew the street wasn't the place to force the issue.  She was so relieved just to have B'Elanna back that she didn't want to make a fuss, so she kept quiet and hung onto B'Elanna's arm for all she was worth.</p>
<p>When they returned to the tent they had very little time to prepare for the banquet that evening so everyone had to content themselves with B'Elanna's evasive answer that the King had only wished to discuss her performance in the tournament with her that afternoon.  B'Elanna was uncharacteristically quiet as they prepared for the evening, but all of Annika's attempts to draw her out were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The King's banquet that night was the largest any of them had ever seen.  The hall was huge and packed with people from the town and from all over England who were in attendance to cement relationships to the throne.  Annika still felt apprehensive when she pictured B'Elanna being led away by the King and his men that afternoon, but aside from being rather quiet B'Elanna seemed no worse for wear and so she determined to try to enjoy herself this evening.  The dancing started and they lined up and for a time were able to put the events of the afternoon from their minds.  </p>
<p>At the front of the hall there was a long line of people who were waiting to speak with the King.  He patiently spent a few moments with each of the people who came before him, neither eating nor drinking while his subjects required his attention.  When the band took a break, Annika and B'Elanna drifted over to the side of the hall and had something to eat.  Annika found herself in conversation with several women she had known slightly from previous tournaments.  After a while she excused herself from the conversation and looked around to find B'Elanna.  She frowned worriedly when she discovered her wife was no longer in the banquet hall.  A quick glance to the front of the room assured her that the King and his men had not left and so she went outside to see if she could find her warrior.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had felt unable to breathe in the crowded banquet hall, and every time she looked at Annika's beautiful face she was reminded that she was keeping a secret from the one person to whom she had sworn absolute honesty.  When she saw Annika preoccupied with her friends she took the opportunity to get some fresh air in the gardens.  It was there that Annika found her a little while later.  Seeing that her love was clearly in the throes of a dilemma Annika opted to be supportive and she simply took B'Elanna's hand and they walked together in silence for some time.</p>
<p>Finally B'Elanna could stand it no longer and she opened her heart to Annika.</p>
<p>"The King has asked me to come with him back to France.  The war isn't going well and he feels that he could put someone with my talents to good purpose in battle."</p>
<p>"No," the word was torn from Annika's lips and she felt cold fear freeze the blood in her veins.</p>
<p>"Annika, in return I would be given land and money enough to support us for the rest of our lives."</p>
<p>"Should you survive the war," Annika said bitterly.</p>
<p>"I will survive, I'm a good soldier and this is the answer to all of our problems.  If I do this thing I can finally give you the life you deserve.  No more traipsing around the countryside living from one tournament to the next.  You'll have a home and all of the comforts to which you are accustomed."  </p>
<p>"Do not put yourself to the hazard thusly in my name," Annika cried.  "I do not desire these things.  All I want or will ever need is you?alive, healthy and in my arms.  I would rather live the rest of my life in a tent with you than risk losing you in the name of money or land.  I beg of you do not do this my love!"  </p>
<p>Tears were streaming down her face and her voice cracked with emotion as she begged B'Elanna not to take this awful risk.</p>
<p>"Don't you see Annika, I must do this for myself.  You say you are content to live this life with me and I believe you?but I am NOT content to have it be so.  I cannot live with myself if I do not take care of the one thing in this world that I value above all others."  B'Elanna tried to make Annika understand why she felt compelled to do this thing.</p>
<p>"If you truly loved me you would not do this," Annika begged.</p>
<p>"It is because I love you that I must.  I owe it to you and to Harry, and yes, even to myself to see this through to the end.  I am a warrior, and I can do nothing else in this world.  So hate me if you must, but understand that I will NOT be deterred."</p>
<p>Annika sank to her knees at the sound of finality in B'Elanna's voice.</p>
<p>"I could never hate you, but you must know that you put my life to the hazard as well as your own, for if you die I cannot go on and I will die with you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna knelt and pulled Annika into her arms.</p>
<p>"I am sorry my love.  It has to be this way."</p>
<p>"It does not," Annika cried, fire flashing in her eyes.  "Tell yourself so if you must, but there is another way.  There has to be."</p>
<p>"If you are asking me to stay behind and be safe then you are asking me to be someone I am not.  I cannot back away from this Annika.  To so would not be true to who I am?I would no longer be the person you fell in love with.  I value my honour above all else but you and if you force me to choose I will choose you?but I pray you will not force this decision for in choosing to stay here with you I fear we will be damaged irreparably.  I am asking you to accept this because you love me."</p>
<p>Annika's face was buried in her hands and so her words were almost unintelligible.</p>
<p>"Then go with my love.  I could never ask you to be other than you are or lose your honour in my name."</p>
<p>"I would gladly sacrifice everything for you, but I fear it would only drive us apart in the end."</p>
<p>Annika took B'Elanna's face in hands.</p>
<p>"Please return to me.  I cannot live without you."</p>
<p>"Nor I without you.  You are brave beyond words my love.  I will never forget this, and I WILL come home to you my most precious wife."</p>
<p>"Take me home," Annika asked simply.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stood up and helped Annika to her feet.  They walked home together without speaking.  When they entered their tent Annika grabbed B'Elanna in a fierce embrace, kissing her deeply.  Her hands began to tear away the clothing that barred her access to her lover's skin.</p>
<p>"Make love to me," she breathed.</p>
<p>Annika's hands were desperate and rough as she pulled at the laces on B'Elanna's tunic.  When she couldn't get them undone she tore the material away in her in her haste and her need.  Her hands were everywhere on B'Elanna's skin; she wanted to possess every inch of her at once. Their lovemaking had always been passionate, but always gentle; B'Elanna was unprepared for this intensity, but she found that it inflamed her own passions and needs.  They felt as if they were making love for the last time.  B'Elanna managed to pull the dress off of her lover's body without damage but the laces of the corset were too much for her in her fevered state.  She took her dagger and cut the laces from top to bottom, tearing the material from her body, the weapon falling neglected to the floor the second its job was done. </p>
<p>Annika pushed her roughly to the bed, removing the last of her clothing before staking her claim once again.  She pulled cinnamon coloured nipples into her mouth, sucking on them until B'Elanna felt pain mix with passion.  Annika's hands and mouth were everyone at once, touching, kneading and wanting.  Her mouth and tongue plundered B'Elanna's until the warrior was groaning with want.  Annika took B'Elanna's hand and pulled it down between her legs.  </p>
<p>"Inside me now.  I need to feel you inside."</p>
<p>B'Elanna parted the petals of skin, surprised to find that they were dripping with the evidence of Annika's need.  With a quick motion B'Elanna flipped them over until she was on top of Annika; her fingers found their way inside her lover's core and she was rewarded with a moan.  She began to ease her hand gently deeper, not wanting to rush anything.  Annika's voice was husky when she spoke again.</p>
<p>"Harder," she moaned, pressing desperately against B'Elanna's hand.  B'Elanna began to move more quickly.</p>
<p>"More, please fill me I need all of you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was worried that she would hurt her wife but she complied with the demand, slipping two more fingers inside, moving quickly and roughly to satiate the need she felt pouring in waves from the beautiful blonde.  Annika's fingers raked down B'Elanna's back as the warrior thrust deeply into her.  She knew she was leaving marks, drawing blood, but none of that mattered now?she needed this.  Her mouth found its way to B'Elanna's neck, sucking hard on tender flesh, knowing that she was marking the skin of her wife and not caring that the marks would be visible for days.  Finally she was unable to contain her need to be filled completely with her lover's essence and she bit down on B'Elanna's shoulder, tasting the copper sweetness of her blood. </p>
<p>B'Elanna cried out when she felt Annika's teeth break the skin of her neck, but the pain was fleeting and the feeling of her wife lapping at the wound inflamed her further.  She was thrusting her whole hand deeply into Annika's core; Annika was pushing back hard, trying to deepen the contact.  Tears were streaming down her face as her body began to convulse in a powerful release.  Desperate arms pulled B'Elanna down on top of her and she sobbed as the warrior held her near, trying to comfort her with words and touch.  Annika held her warrior wife close as she cried herself to sleep</p>
