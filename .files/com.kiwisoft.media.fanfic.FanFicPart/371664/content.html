<p style="text-align:center;"><i><u>What I didn't know</u></i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Chapter 2: Y Tanto Dices<br>
</i><i>(And Much You Say)</i></p>
<p>It's calling me. Seriously it is. Have you ever been somewhere and felt as if someone was watching you. You know, this constant pressure in the side of your head, like if someone was pushing their thumb on a specific spot on the side of your crown. Well yeah, that's exactly what I'm feeling now. The thing has no eyes, but I can still feel it staring at me. Calling me; it's saying "Read me. Read me. You know you want to." And damn right I do!</p>
<p>I look to my right and find Lily soundly asleep. Her head to the side and her right arm bended upward, close to it. It's not even eight in the night, but she's already out like a light. So, How to get Lily to quickly fall asleep? Step one: Find a big box of pizza, (or whatever type of food, it doesn't really matter since she eats almost anything) and feed it to her before or during a movie. Step two: Allow her to watch the movie. And Step three: Behold the results of your hard work. If done correctly you'll only have to wait from ten minutes to half and hour for fruition.</p>
<p>I laugh softly at this, before it itches again. I gaze at the sleeping blond one more time before getting out of bed as quietly as I can. Just as silently I make my way to the notebook's hidden chamber and, glancing one more time behind me, retrieve it.</p>
<p>Not wanting to act too paranoid, I walk into Lily's bathroom. I lock the door and sit on lid of the toilet. Opening the notebook once again, I skim through the pages. I read some of them, but those don't seem to be directed towards anyone in particular. They also don't have anything written in their posterior.</p>
<p>Recalling that very important detail I decide to search for what's written on the back of the pages instead of the front. The story of Lily and that mysterious girl is bout to appear there. And, as with the previous poem, by the end of the notebook I found another little piece of information.</p>
<p>I opt to read the poem first and then if I cannot decipher what it conceals I'll go into reading her direct words. Who am I kidding? I would read them both even if I did understand.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Y Tanto Dices<br>
<i><u>(And Much You Say)</u></i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tu que tanto dices conocerme<br>
No conoces mis pensamientos<br>
Ni mis anelos<br>
O sentimientos</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(You who say to know me so much<br>
</i><i>You don't of my thoughts<br>
</i><i>Nor of my longings<br>
</i><i>Or feelings).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tu y nadie mas que tú<br>
Ignoras mis pedidos<br>
No comprendes los que digo<br>
Entumeces mis sentidos</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(You and only you<br>
</i><i>Ignores my requests<br>
</i><i>You don't comprehend what I say<br>
</i><i>You numb my senses).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Tú que si y no a la vez<br>
Tú que no me conoces tanto<br>
Pues no sabes de mi llanto<br>
O de tu encanto</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(You that yes and no at the same time<br>
</i><i>You who doesn't know me so much<br>
</i><i>For you don't know of my cry<br>
</i><i>Or of your enchant).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Pues ni modo<br>
Tu que me conoces<br>
Yo que te conozco<br>
No sabes de tantas veces<br>
En las que quiero pero no te toco.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>(Well, no matter<br>
</i><i>You who know me,<br>
</i><i>I who know you<br>
</i><i>You don't know of so many times<br>
</i><i>In which want but I don't touch you).</i></p>
<p>Good thing we took Spanish, if not I wouldn't have understood a thing.</p>
<p>Apparently, I'm not the only one with a self-love problem, this girl does too. I wonder who could be the girl who has captured Lily's heart.</p>
<p>I turn the page and read what's behind it. There's always the possibility of Lily revealing the name of that mysterious girl in the little privacy of these pages.</p>
<p><i>She is one of my best friends and she thinks she knows so much. There are times in which she makes me think she believes to know everything about me. I know she doesn't really think that way, she's neither immature nor naïve. But still, that's the impression. It annoys me at times, and it amuses me at others. Because I know that in reality, she knows nothing. </i></p>
<p>What? One of her best friends but, for what I know, Lily only has two best friends, Oliver… and me.</p>
<p>I intend to keep pondering about this; perhaps Lily has some other best-friend I don't know of. One from her childhood before I even moved here or something, but there's a knock on the door.</p>
<p>"Miley? Are you in there?" Came Lily's sleepy voice from the other side.</p>
<p>"Ah, Yeah! Just a minute!" I replied. I am so grateful for it been chilly today, for I decided to wear some jeans with an elbow-long sleeveless yellow blouse and a cream jacket on top of it. I quickly push the notebook between my pants and my right hip and close my jacket around it, zipping it up I unlocked the door.</p>
<p>"I thought the toilet had swallowed you!" She said, eyeing me with a raised eyebrow. I guess I looked rather funny to her, all covered up and all.</p>
<p>"Please you were snoring so loud you wouldn't have noticed!" I teased her.</p>
<p>"I do not snore!" She said indignantly. I laughed. She obviously wouldn't know, but she does snore. It's rather lightly, cute, and it bothers no one, but it can't be denied!</p>
<p>"Yes you do, but can we discuss your snoring some other day? I have to get home now. I'll see you tomorrow at school!" I gave her a smile and practically ran out of the room, leaving a probably very bewildered Lily behind.</p>
<p>I didn't want to take the notebook slash diary with me, I feel like I should have never opened the thing in the first place. But there's no going back now, I'll just come back tomorrow and leave it exactly where I found it. Well, no, not precisely in the same place, maybe just close by.</p>
<p>Still, I am rather confused right now. What she wrote keeps bouncing in my head as if it owned the place. But whatever, I can have as strong a will as this thing's persuasion.</p>
<p>So, I can assure you one thing! I'll do no more reading of it from now on!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">To be continued…</p>
