<p><b>A/N: I began to write this because I wanted to get my gears back into writing. I took a little vacation for around four days and I didn't read or write anything during that time. So I'm a little out of shape. My mind just doesn't seem to want to get started. To make it get its pants on is the purpose of this five-chaptered little story. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i><u>What I didn't know</u></i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Chapter 1: Good Boy</i></p>
<p>(Miley's P.O.V)</p>
<p>The swift and sporadic breeze carries the melodious voice of birds throughout the skies. The ceiling of the world is bright blue, a beautiful calm color that contrasts with the mischievous wind. Yet, the clouds don't seem to be annoyed by the invisible being's lack of stillness. They appear to be enjoying it, dancing into some kind of morph ritual. It is in days like this when you can literally see them moving and without noticing it you become enthralled with their sway.</p>
<p>It is a perfect day to go out on a walk, for the moment that is. In a minute the clouds can shape their colors and fusion their forms engulfing you into a massive cry. For this reason I hasten my pace, I do not want to bring my soaking self as a gift to Lily's house.</p>
<p>Finally reaching, I climb the three steps into her lobby and ring the doorbell. Seconds later I am welcome by the one person I came to see.</p>
<p>"Hey there Miles! You are late, as always." She says with a little smirk. I simply smile and pass by her.</p>
<p>"You know it." I do not make excuses nor do I apologize. In occasions I tend to say <i>'My bad'</i> just for saying something, but I do not feel like it today. Lily knows I'm always late, in the same way she knows I always arrive if nothing major gets in my way. I have this saying that goes <i>'The Queen is never late, everyone else is just early'</i>, and yes I stole that from <i><u>Princess Diaries</u></i>, but it is so true! Even if I am not a Queen.</p>
<p>"Whatever. Come on let's go to my room." She says right before she begins to make her way to the stairs. On my way after her I wave a greeting to Mrs. Truscott, who I just notice is in the kitchen, the woman waves back and I disappear.</p>
<p>Up in Lily's room we sit on her bed and talk for a while. Nothing important, just what we did during this extremely boring Sunday and whatnot. Perhaps a few sentences were spared on my ex-boyfriend, Jeremy. I dated him for more than a year, and we have been apart for around four to five months already, but Lily still worries and asks how I'm doing.</p>
<p>After a while Lily asked me if I wanted to see a movie, and I, having hypnotize my mind (in Lily's opinion) that Sundays are a lazy day and should be respected as such, of course said yes. She put in her DVD one called <i>'Pan's Labyrinth'</i>. I had never seen that movie, but it doesn't seem like the type of movie Lily would like. From the cover and the title I could guess it was a movie for children and/or people who loved fantasy, most certainly not Lily's thing. Her preference lied more in gore oriented movies.</p>
<p>"Wait a second, I'll be right back." She said out of nowhere, and leaving the movie on the Menu Screen, ran out the door. I smile and shook my head, she could be such a weird girl sometimes.</p>
<p>So, now I'm alone in her room with nothing to do until she comes back, which shouldn't take long, but with her you never knew. I don't even know what she went to do! Anyway, I could be mean today and start the movie without her; then again, I don't like to watch movies alone, it is depressing.</p>
<p>I'm looking around the room now as I wait for her. And yes, her room is just as you would imagine it, not exactly dirty but completely unorganized. For exception of some specific spots, like the corner where her skateboards lay or the bookshelf you would never believe she had. The rest is a mess, the mirror is dirty with fingerprints, there are spider webs on the upper corners of her walls, some clothes are coming out of her drawers and almost everything is cover with a thin layer of dust. But hey, this is Lily's room and it screams her name;<i> 'it also screams I don't give a shit'</i>.</p>
<p>I stand up from the bed and walk over to the bookshelf by the end of the room. She often has some interesting books, aside from the ever so popular Mangas. Their genre goes from romance novels, that are mostly given as presents to her, to crimes or investigation -however you call them- and suspense. Sometimes she had some that people lend them, about vampires and mythology; those are the ones I actually take the time to read.</p>
<p>Scanning the books, I search for one that might be into my predilection, I spot none. Nevertheless, I do take notice of a small hard-cover book with no title, that lays out of place on top of some other books. Out of curiosity, I take it into my hands. Examining its exterior I still find no title, only a fairy dressed in black seeming to fly towards you from a violet background. Acknowledging the fact that I will only know what's within by opening it, I do as thought to find that this is not a book, it a notebook; a rather used one at that.</p>
<p>The first page reads in three different lines one after the other, right in the middle of the page, above the shade of the same fairy of the cover: '<i>Poems. Written by. Lily Truscott',</i>. Would you look at that! Lily writes poems! Who would have thought? Then again, they say those who read a lot tend to end up writing too. I should have known.</p>
<p>There are so many in here. I am intrigued to know what she writes about, but I do not have the time right now and something tells me Lily wouldn't let me if I asked for it. Had she wanted me to read them she would have showed them to me herself, right? Yet, even when I know I shouldn't be invading her privacy in such a manner, I can't help but to close my eyes and skip through the pages stopping on one by the end of the notebook.</p>
<p>The title is 'Good Boy'. Funny, it sounds as if she was writing to her dog, even though she owns none. This is probably a funny joke she thought of but there was no one around her to tell it to, so she wrote it. Hoping to amuse myself, I begin to read.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>"Good Boy" </u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sometimes I say it without meaning<br>
Other times I get this feeling<br>
That I truly do<br>
I truly do hate you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I hate how you are making me feel.<br>
And at the same time I don't.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I hate you,<br>
Because I can't stay mad at you<br>
No matter what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I hate you,<br>
Because no matter what I think or say<br>
Like "I'm going to run away"<br>
I can't, I have to stay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I hate how you make me feel<br>
You don't even have to speak<br>
I already know the deal<br>
You order and I do the trick.</p>
<p>Okay, this was not funny. I do not know what to think of it. Should I laugh, because she wrote of herself as a silly dog in love? Or should I feel mad or sad for her because she can't help herself? Yet what most worries me is who makes her feel this way?</p>
<p>With a slight frown I turn the page wondering if the poem continues. It doesn't. But there are other things written instead. The back of the page in which the poem is written apparently works as her diary. Once more, I know I shouldn't read it but I can't restrain myself.</p>
<p><i>How stupid can this get? I feel so impotent when I'm around her. No, when I'm not even close to her I feel the same annoying way. She just has to call, and I run to her need. It can be morning day or night; the word 'No' doesn't exist for her. I am her lap dog. </i></p>
<p>Oh, My, Fricking, God! I knew I shouldn't have read this. This has to be Lily's most private secret! Lily's in love with a girl! She's lesbian! Or…bi! I don't know. It doesn't matter really. I'm a bit hurt that she didn't tell me, I mean, I'm her best friend. She should be able to trust me. But I understand that this is not an easy thing to say.</p>
<p>Still, I am rather pissed of at that girl! How can she treat Lily like that?</p>
<p>"Hey! Mom is going to buy pizza!" Lily screams as she comes through the door and scares the shit out of me. In my fright I let go of the notebook and it falls to the pile of clothes that lay beside the bookshelf. I bend down and cover it as I try to think of an excuse. Thinking quickly I pick up a boot that was near.</p>
<p>"Hey this is sooo cute! I have to borrow it!" I say turning around with a fake, and exaggerated, smile on my face.</p>
<p>"Uh…it's not cuter than your amazing white Hannah boots" – She says in a dreamy voice. I could swear she's drooling. How funny, I'll have to lend them to Lola soon. – "But yeah, you can barrow them." She then adds, coming back to reality.</p>
<p>"Great! Now, you were saying something about pizza?" I quickly say, trying to keep her from noticing anything. The faster I can get away from my current position, the better.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah! But we have to get them ourselves." She says a little disappointed. I really don't get it, she can skateboard for hours but she can't walk for ten minutes.</p>
<p>"Okay, then let's go!" I say and discreetly throw the boot on top of the mound of clothes. Then I walk toward Lily and drag her out of her room.</p>
<p>As we walk on the sidewalk, I can only wonder if she will ever tell me about it.</p>
