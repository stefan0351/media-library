<!-- Accidental Love \ Part 6 -->

<p>Swirling memories of Christmases past danced in the wealthy woman's dreamscape;
			presents wished for and received, laughter and merriment, wrapping paper ripped apart in
			anticipation of the treasures hidden within. The sound of someone crying slowly broke
			through the fog, pulling Ronnie away from her childhood and back to the present. Her eyes
			opened to the darkness of night and it took her a moment to realize where she was and what
			she was hearing. "Rose," she whispered to herself, shaking off the weight of
			sleep and getting up.</p>
		<p>"Rose?" she called from the doorway.</p>
		<p>"Did I wake you? I'm sorry," the young woman choked, grateful the darkness
			kept her tears hidden from her friend's gaze.</p>
		<p>"I knew the stuff I had wouldn't do any good," Ronnie said as she entered the
			room and sat down on the bed. "You want me to run out now? I'm completely
			sober."</p>
		<p>Rose shook her head. "No, please don't leave." The pain was practically
			unbearable but the thought of suffering through it without Ronnie was even worse.
			"Please." She reached out and gripped the larger hand with her own. "Can
			you?can you stay here with me?" There was a shift in weight as the taller woman
			slipped under the covers.</p>
		<p>"I'm right here." Ronnie moved as close as she dared, telling herself it was
			for Rose's comfort and not her own. She was surprised when she felt the soft cheek press
			up against her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Is this all right?" the young woman whispered. Ronnie felt the tears soak
			through her cotton tee and realized Rose must have been crying for quite a while before
			she had been awakened.</p>
		<p>"It's fine," Ronnie answered, moving a bit closer. </p>
		<p>"It hurts," Rose admitted, lifting her head to allow Ronnie's arm to slip
			underneath. They shifted their bodies into more comfortable positions, at least as
			comfortable as they could considering the injured woman could not roll onto her side
			because of her broken legs. Ronnie managed to bury her face into the soft golden hair,
			breathing in the gentle scent. Rose found herself snuggled into the crook of the older
			woman's shoulder, a place far more comfortable to her than the softest pillow could ever
			be. In Ronnie's arms she felt safe, protected, cared for. The throbbing pain was still
			there, yet somehow it seemed bearable now. Within moments both women were fast asleep.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Rose awoke to throbbing pain in her legs and the sound of Ronnie clacking away on the
			computer. "Good morning," she yawned, snuggling back into the warmth of her
			pillow.</p>
		<p>"Morning. Your pills are there on the stand." The executive stopped typing
			and turned around to face her. It was then that Rose noticed Ronnie was dressed for work,
			a tailored gray skirt and blazer combination accented by a cream colored blouse.</p>
		<p>"You went out already?" The young woman sat up slowly, clearly surprised.</p>
		<p>"I called the hospital as soon as I woke up and explained the situation to
			them." She moved her chair closer and poured a glass of water from the pitcher.
			"Doctor Barnes was there and had another prescription in for you right away,"
			she said while handing the cup to Rose. "Then it was just a matter of running out and
			picking it up." She watched the young woman take her pills before she turned and
			pressed a few more keys. "I've got to get going. Do you need anything before I
			leave?"</p>
		<p>"No, I'm sure Karen will be here soon. Is Maria here?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, she got here about a half hour ago. I'll let her know you're awake."
			Ronnie stood up and shut the computer off. "Are you sure I can't get you
			anything?"</p>
		<p>"No, really, I'm all set. You have a good day at work. Do you think Tommy will be
			there?"</p>
		<p>"I doubt it. He said something last night about not being in the office
			today." A flash of anger over last night's events clouded her features. "He'd
			better not show up either." She reached over and gave Tabitha a quick pet. "My
			office number is two on the speed dial if you want to give me a call."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I wouldn't want to bother you or anything." Rose silently wished Ronnie
			would give her a hug goodbye but could not bring herself to ask for one.</p>
		<p>"If you feel like calling, you just do it. Don't worry about bothering me because
			you won't." She hesitated for a moment. "It's kinda nice to hear a friendly
			voice in the middle of the day."</p>
		<p>"Okay then. I'll call you later." She set the glass down and looked at her
			friend. "Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Mmm?"</p>
		<p>"Thank you for running out this morning. I really appreciate it."</p>
		<p>Ronnie smiled. "You're welcome." She reached out and gave Rose's hand a
			squeeze. "Now I really do have to get to work. Call me later, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>It was late afternoon when the door to Ronnie's office opened and Susan entered,
			carrying a manila folder. "I was right," the redhead said triumphantly as she
			tossed the folder onto the desk.</p>
		<p>"You were right about what?" Ronnie asked disinterestedly, not bothering to
			turn away from her computer.</p>
		<p>"Your guest." She picked up the folder and opened it, reviewing the
			information she had acquired. "Rose Grayson graduated from Albany High School. There
			is no record of her ever having attending college anywhere or owning a credit card. She
			doesn't even have a driver's license."</p>
		<p>Ronnie stood up quickly, sending her chair rolling back as she grabbed the folder out
			of Susan's hands. "You investigated her?"</p>
		<p>"I had to," the younger sister protested. "You obviously believe
			everything she says."</p>
		<p>"And what does it matter to you?"</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, she obviously has nothing and saw a good meal ticket."</p>
		<p>"You have no idea what you're talking about." She slammed the folder down on
			her desk. "Rose is not using me."</p>
		<p>"No? Do you know where she was employed before you gave her a job?"</p>
		<p>"Money Slasher, I know. She was a cashier there."</p>
		<p>"A part time cashier," Susan corrected, "making minimum wage. From what
			I can tell, before that she bussed tables at a diner."</p>
		<p>"What is your point?"</p>
		<p>"My point is why are you doing this? Why are you letting some poor white trash
			live off of you?"</p>
		<p>"Don't?you?EVER call her that again!" Ronnie roared. "You have
			no idea what you're talking about, and as far as 'white trash' goes, have you taken a good
			look at Tommy lately?"</p>
		<p>"You're trying to change the subject."</p>
		<p>"Am I? You're judging her because she doesn't have the money you and I do. How
			fair is that?" She walked over to the window and looked out at the dreary gray sky.
			"Did you take the time to talk to her? To find out what kind of a person she is? No.
			Not everyone who doesn't have money is scum and not everyone who is rich is a good
			person."</p>
		<p>"I'm not saying that."</p>
		<p>"You're not? You find out she wasn't born to privilege and right away you assume
			she's a gold digger."</p>
		<p>"Then what is she, Ronnie? Help me understand because right now I don't,"
			Susan challenged. "Try looking at it from the family's point of view. A woman we've
			never heard of suddenly moves into your home, complete with a cat and obvious medical
			problems and you expect us to just sit back and not be concerned?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I do. It's my life, Susan. Who stays in my home is my concern, not yours. I
			didn't run an investigation on Jack when you announced you were going to marry him."</p>
		<p>"Are you planning on marrying her?"</p>
		<p>"You still won't accept that she is just a friend, will you?" She crossed the
			room and flopped down on the black leather couch. "Why does it bother you so
			much?"</p>
		<p>"I just don't want to see you hurt?again."</p>
		<p>"This is not like Christine, I told you that before."</p>
		<p>"You may not think so, but from what I see?"</p>
		<p>"Then you had better look again. Rose doesn't want anything from me. She's just a
			friend. Stop trying to make this into something more than it is." She kicked her
			shoes off and tucked her feet up under her legs. "You don't know her, Susan. You
			don't know what she's like. Last night her bottle of Percocet was stolen. I offered to go
			get more but she didn't want me to. Does that sound like someone who is only interested in
			my money? She hasn't once asked me to buy her a damn thing. Everything I do, I do because
			I want to, not because she asks me to." She waved her hand dismissively. "You
			don't understand, forget it."</p>
		<p>"Look. You're an adult. You have to make your own decisions. I ran every check I
			could on her today. All the info is in that file. Do with it what you want." Susan
			headed for the door. "Ronnie, don't forget dinner tomorrow at Mother's."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm looking forward to it," she said sarcastically. "Did you fax
			her a copy of your precious report? Or did you just take an ad out in the Times
			Useless?"</p>
		<p>"That wasn't necessary, Ronnie. I'm just looking out for you."</p>
		<p>"Last time I looked, I was taking care of myself just fine. I don't recall asking
			you to baby-sit me."</p>
		<p>"Fine. Do what you want, you will anyway." Susan left, not bothering to close
			the door. Laura, who had been listening to the raised voices, discreetly closed it and
			returned to her desk, knowing the intercom would buzz in a few seconds.</p>
		<p>"Laura, hold my calls." A second later, line two lit up and the young
			administrative assistant would have bet her entire paycheck that she knew who her boss was
			calling.</p>
		<p>"Cartwright Residence," Maria answered.</p>
		<p>"Hi Maria, may I speak with Rose please?" Ronnie was still sitting on her
			couch in the office, the block multi-line phone sitting on the floor next to her. It was
			at times like this she appreciated the extra length in the gray phone cord, even if it did
			get tangled up in her feet under the desk from time to time.</p>
		<p>"Hello?"</p>
		<p>"Hi there." At the sound of Rose's voice, Ronnie smiled, the stress of her
			conversation with Susan melting away. "How was Judge Judy today?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, you wouldn't believe the cases she had."</p>
		<p>"Tell me about them," she urged, settling back into a comfortable position.
			Ronnie could not explain it but the sound of Rose's voice had a soothing effect on her
			and, at the moment, she needed that comfort.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>A few days later, Rose was at the hospital to get her stitches removed and to have new
			X-rays taken of her legs. Ronnie sat in the waiting area, reading six-month old magazines
			to pass the time.</p>
		<p>"Almost finished," Doctor Barnes said, removing the last of the stitches on
			Rose's cheek. She stepped back and threw her latex gloves in the red waste receptacle.
			"Looks good. I don't think you'll have a scar. Remember to keep it out of the sun
			until it's fully healed. Not that that is a problem this time of year." She made a
			notation on Rose's chart. "You're recovering splendidly. At the rate you're going, I
			see no reason why you won't be on crutches by late Spring."</p>
		<p>"Late Spring?"</p>
		<p>"Late Spring," the doctor repeated. "Your body suffered a severe trauma.
			Your ankle alone was broken in seven places. It's going to take time to heal. Understand
			this, Miss Grayson, we're talking months of therapy, not weeks." The young woman's
			heart sank at the words. She knew it would take time, just not that long. How would Ronnie
			react? Surely that would be too long to stay at the place she was quickly thinking of as
			home.</p>
		<p>Despite Rose's fears, Ronnie took the news well, more concerned about the progress of
			the recovery than the time frame. Although it caused some discomfort, the young woman
			insisted she could ride in the back seat of the Cherokee by sitting sideways, allowing her
			legs to rest on the deep gray velour. Ronnie did her best to avoid potholes, but there
			were still a few times when she looked into the rear view mirror and saw Rose wince as
			they passed over a particularly rough spot of road. "You know I could stay home
			tonight," she said as they turned onto Cartwright Drive.</p>
		<p>"No, your mother and sister are expecting you. I'll be fine."</p>
		<p>"But what if you need to use the bedpan or something? What if you need a
			drink?" She pulled the Jeep into the driveway and turned off the ignition.</p>
		<p>"I'll go before you leave. If you fill that pitcher on the stand, I'm sure I'll be
			fine."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie was late arriving at her mother's condo. She blamed it on the Friday rush hour
			traffic but the truth was she found it difficult to leave Rose alone. A full pitcher of
			water, cans of soda cooling in the ice bucket, various snacks all within easy reach of the
			injured woman?she left nothing to chance, even going so far as to write down her
			mother's phone number just in case Rose needed anything.</p>
		<p>The small round dining table had just enough room for everyone. Ronnie found herself
			seated between Elaine and Susan. It was bad enough to be a lefty stuck next to a
			right-handed person but the pungent smell of her aunt's perfume threatened to take away
			Ronnie's appetite. "Smell's wonderful," Susan said as the platter of meat was
			placed on the table.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, dear," Beatrice replied as if she were the one who had spent
			hours preparing the food instead of her part-time helper. "You know your sister
			always enjoys a good pork roast."</p>
		<p>"Yes I do," Ronnie readily agreed, reaching for the platter.</p>
		<p>"Hey, leave some for the rest of us."</p>
		<p>"Now Susan, don't you worry about it," her mother chastised. "There's
			plenty for everyone." She turned to her eldest daughter. "You just take as much
			as you want, dear. I'm sure you must be tired of those reheated dinners that Maria makes
			for you."</p>
		<p>Ronnie poured the steaming gravy over her pork. "Maria's a great cook, Mother, you
			know that."</p>
		<p>"I know that when I ran the house she worked until eight o'clock each night. I
			never had to worry about dirty dishes piling up until morning."</p>
		<p>"I have a dishwasher."</p>
		<p>"Humph, another appliance purchased so she could work less, no doubt."
			Beatrice ladled some gravy onto her plate. "You know you spoil her."</p>
		<p>"I know," Ronnie grinned, drawing a smirk from her sister and an annoyed
			frown from her mother.</p>
		<p>"First it was every weekend off, then it was shorter hours. At the rate she's
			going, you're going to pay her to stay home just like those welfare people."</p>
		<p>"Mother, she puts in a full work week just like anyone else."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure she's busier than ever with your friend there," Susan chimed in.</p>
		<p>"Yes, how is that poor dear?" Elaine asked. "She seemed like such a nice
			girl. What was her name? Rachel, Ruth?"</p>
		<p>"Rose," Ronnie corrected.</p>
		<p>"Ah yes," the visiting relative replied, not at all interested in the correct
			name. "Well anyway, she seemed like a nice girl. Pass the corn, please. Bea, did you
			see in the paper where they are rabble rousing about health care again?"</p>
		<p>"You'd think the president would have better things to worry about," the
			matriarch replied. "Jack, do you know anyone without insurance?"</p>
		<p>"Of course not, Mother," he replied, learning long ago exactly what answers
			his mother-in-law wanted to hear.</p>
		<p>"See, that's my point exactly. They need to worry about more important things like
			reforming the tax code or bringing prayer back to school." Beatrice took a sip of
			wine. "I'm telling you, that's where the country went wrong. There was a time when
			children respected their elders. Now I can't get the paperboy to leave the paper between
			the doors when it's raining. And he wonders why I don't tip him. Tips should be earned,
			but nowadays they seem to think they deserve it just for doing their jobs."</p>
		<p>Throughout the rest of dinner and into the after dinner drinks, Ronnie tried to pay
			attention to the conversation but found her mind slipping back to thoughts of the blonde
			woman waiting for her at home. She wondered if she would sleep on the couch or if Rose
			would let her share the bed again. She hoped the latter. Ronnie's mind was so far away she
			did not hear her mother address her and it was only Susan kicking her under the table that
			brought her back to the present. "I'm sorry, what?"</p>
		<p>Beatrice gave an annoyed huff. "I asked you if you planned on coming here for
			Christmas. Honestly, Ronnie."</p>
		<p>"Sorry, I was just thinking about something."</p>
		<p>"Or someone," Susan said so quietly only her sister could hear it.</p>
		<p>"Actually I thought I'd spend Christmas at home this year," she replied,
			shooting a glare at her younger sister.</p>
		<p>"Oh good. Elaine asked me to join her on a cruise but I didn't want you to have
			nowhere to go."</p>
		<p>"What about Tommy?" Susan asked.</p>
		<p>"He said he had other plans this year, something about going up to the mountains
			with some friends of his. You and Jack have the boys, so the only one I was worried about
			was your sister."</p>
		<p>"I'll be fine, Mother." Ronnie looked at her watch. "I didn't realize
			the time. I need to swing by the office and pick up some files before it gets too
			late." She stood up and tossed her napkin on the now empty plate. "Dinner was
			wonderful, as always."</p>
		<p>"That's my daughter, always working," Beatrice said. "Perhaps someday
			you'll find the time to settle down and make me some grandchildren."</p>
		<p>Ronnie ignored the jibe and donned her jacket. "I really need to get going."
			She glanced out the window. "It's beginning to come down really hard out there."</p>
		<p>"Of course, of course. You go work on making money. I guess I'll have to depend on
			Jack and Susan to give me a granddaughter."</p>
		<p>"I guess so," the black-haired woman said as she reached for the door handle.
			"Jack, you'd better be careful on the way home, looks like sleet. Goodnight
			everyone."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Hey, you're still up," Ronnie said when she walked into what used to be
			considered the office and now was Rose's room.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, it's only ten."</p>
		<p>"Anything good on?"</p>
		<p>"Not really." Rose used the remote to mute the television before patting the
			space on the bed next to her. "So how did your dinner go?"</p>
		<p>"Draining," the older woman sighed, taking the offered seat on the adjustable
			bed and leaning back into a comfortable position. "Now I remember why I hate family
			dinners so much."</p>
		<p>"Why is that?"</p>
		<p>"Everyone talks about nothing. They went on and on about things they have no
			control over like taxes and tipping. Not to mention Mother started in again about my not
			giving her grandchildren."</p>
		<p>"Oh, that's too bad. Does she do that a lot?"</p>
		<p>"Every opportunity she can," Ronnie shrugged. "Come on, let's see what's
			on TV."</p>
		<p>They settled back and watched a crime drama. Both of them guessing who the murderer was
			long before the cops figured it out. When it was over Rose found she was unable to stifle
			a yawn. "Sorry, must be more tired than I thought," she apologized when Ronnie
			pressed the button on the remote to shut the television off.</p>
		<p>"That's okay. It is getting late. I guess I'd better get going and let you get
			some sleep." She made a move to get off the bed only to be stopped by Rose's hand on
			her arm.</p>
		<p>"Are you going upstairs?"</p>
		<p>"No, I'll probably crash on the couch, why?"</p>
		<p>"You know, it's a big bed and I am sure it's more comfortable than the couch is.
			You could stay here." Rose bit her lower lip. "I mean, if you want to, I don't
			mind."</p>
		<p>Ronnie hesitated for only a second. "Well, I wouldn't want to crowd you or
			anything."</p>
		<p>"You haven't yet."</p>
		<p>"It is more comfortable than the couch?but only if you're sure." If the
			truth were told, she could fall asleep in either place, but one definitely was preferred
			over the other.</p>
		<p>"I'm sure." Rose pulled one of the two pillows out from behind her head.
			"Here, I'll even share."</p>
		<p>Ronnie smiled at the gesture. "Let me change and get the light."</p>
		<p>A few minutes later Ronnie was changed into her sweats and a cotton T-shirt. She shut
			the light off and scooted under the blanket, consciously keeping her body from moving over
			and pressing against Rose no matter how much it wanted to. Her resolve lasted only until
			the moment sleep overtook her, when her body took over and did what it wanted so
			desperately to do when she was awake. </p>
		<p>Half-asleep, Rose woke up completely when she felt the strong arm rest across her
			stomach. Ronnie gave a soft sigh of contentment in her sleep and snuggled closer, her warm
			breath caressing the smaller woman's shoulder. Rose smiled in the dark and brought her
			left hand down to rest atop the larger one. It should have seemed strange to sleep next to
			someone after spending the first twenty-six years of her life sleeping alone but it
			didn't. Lying next to Ronnie felt natural, comfortable, right. She believed the older
			woman truly cared for her, something Rose had never really felt before. It filled her with
			a sense of?well, whatever it was she could not quite name but it was a wonderful
			feeling just the same. Another sigh and the older woman moved even closer, her chin
			resting just above Rose's shoulder and her face buried in the blonde hair. </p>
		<p>Time ticked by while the young woman enjoyed the sensations, the warmth of Ronnie's
			hand through the cotton nightshirt, the gentle breaths tickling her ear. The feeling of
			safety and security covered her like no blanket ever could. Rose had friends growing up,
			playmates, girls to share secrets with, but she never felt toward them what she felt
			toward Ronnie. Her feelings ran deeper than anything she had ever known and although it
			should have scared her, it didn't. She turned her head to the side and placed a gentle
			kiss on Ronnie's forehead. "Sweet dreams," she whispered before closing her eyes
			and letting sleep overtake her.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The rusted out station wagon chugged its way up Morris Street. Delores Bickering
			spotted the address she was looking for and double-parked in front of it. She had planned
			on visiting her sister but decided since she was in the area anyway it would not hurt to
			stop in and see Rose, especially since she had not received a reply, or a check, from the
			young woman yet. She rolled down the window and reached for the outside handle, the only
			way to open the car door, and stepped out. She walked down the steps leading to the
			basement apartment, frowning when she saw a Hispanic couple moving about inside. She
			knocked on the door. "Does Rose Grayson live here?"</p>
		<p>"No, we just moved in. You might want to check with Cecil. He lives
			upstairs."</p>
		<p>"What the fuck you want?" Cecil asked when he opened the door.</p>
		<p>"I'm looking for Rose Grayson. I thought she lived here."</p>
		<p>"Moved out," he grunted. "Damn bitch didn't give me no notice
			either."</p>
		<p>"Do you know where she moved to?"</p>
		<p>"Who the fuck are you?" He looked at Delores suspiciously.</p>
		<p>"I'm her mother," she lied.</p>
		<p>"I don't know and I don't give a shit. If you want to know, you should ask the
			bitch that was here. Hang on, I got her name here somewhere. I wrote it down in case the
			check she gave me bounced." He went back into the apartment, leaving her standing
			outside. He returned a minute later with a Post-It note with scribbling on it. "Here,
			that's the name and address of the bitch that moved her stuff out."</p>
		<p>Delores took the paper and looked at it. V. Cartwright, One Cartwright Drive,
			Loudonville. "Did you get a phone number?"</p>
		<p>"Do I look like the fucking information booth?" he snarled. "That's all
			I know. Now, unless you're interested in renting the third floor, you're wasting my
			fucking time." He shut the door without waiting for an answer. Delores walked back to
			her car, puzzled. Anyone who lived on a street with the same name as theirs was no doubt
			rich, and the fact that it was in Loudonville, where no one on welfare could afford to
			live was even more intriguing. She decided she needed to find out more. She adjusted the
			pillow on the front seat, the only thing keeping the worn springs from pressing into her
			bottom, and turned the key several times before the twenty year old station wagon
			sputtered to life.</p>
		<p>She stopped at the nearest convenience store to gas up the car, not bothering to pull
			up to the furthest pump.
			<i>Let them wait</i>, she thought to herself while putting the
			nozzle into the tank. She put exactly five dollars worth of gas into the tank before
			entering the store. Once inside, she picked up a street map of Albany County and headed
			for the back where the soda coolers were lined up. While opening the case with one hand,
			Delores used her other to stuff the street map into her pocketbook. She approached the
			pimply-faced clerk with a bottle of Pepsi in her hand. "Seventy-five cents for the
			soda and five for the gas," the clerk said. Delores pulled a worn bill out of her
			jacket pocket along with a one-dollar food stamp. The clerk nodded and returned her a
			quarter, completely unaware of the shoplifting. As she always did, Delores could not
			resist smirking as she exited the store, having once again gotten away with getting
			something for nothing.
		</p>
		<p>The station wagon sputtered and worked its way through the congested traffic of Albany
			into the quieter suburb of Loudonville. In the village where the average income was well
			into six digits, the rusted out Ford with fake wooden panels stood out in stark contrast
			to the newer vehicles of Ronnie's neighborhood. Delores made two wrong turns before
			finding Cartwright Drive, blaming both of them on the street map and not on herself.
			Deciding the large mansion at the beginning of the street had to be number-one, she pulled
			the uninspected and uninsured car into the long driveway, stopping it just behind a bright
			blue Jeep Cherokee. She removed the key from the ignition and waited for a moment while
			the car continued to run before it finally gave a dying gasp and went silent. Drips of oil
			stained the driveway as she rolled down the window to reach the door handle.
			<i>No doubt
				about it,</i> she thought to herself.
			<i>This has to be Number One Cartwright Drive.</i>
			If Rose knew the person who owned this place, well that certainly was worth investigating,
			Delores reasoned. She spotted the shoveled flagstone walkway that circled the lawn and led
			to the large double-door entrance and followed it.
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Ronnie was working on her computer when she heard the rattling sound of a car pulling
			into her driveway. A quick look at the bed confirmed Rose was still sound asleep. She
			stood up and walked to the window, blue eyes widening at the sight of the brown, white,
			and rust colored station wagon sitting in her driveway. "What the hell??"
			The window rolled down and an arm reached out for the handle. She watched as a rotund
			woman, poorly dressed, stepped out of the car and looked at the house. Ronnie's first
			thought was it was either a lost traveler or one of those annoying door-to-door
			salespeople. She took another look at the peacefully sleeping woman and decided to
			intercept the unexpected arrival before the doorbell could wake Rose.</p>
		<p>Ronnie opened the door and realized this was no door-to-door salesperson. A black knit
			cap with a pompom at the tip covered the head of a woman who appeared to be in her
			mid-forties while a dirty yellow jacket littered with various stains covered the upper
			body. She held an oversized purse in hands that bore no gloves and her feet were covered
			with a pair of sneakers which had long ago stopped being considered white. The dark-haired
			executive looked down at the shorter woman and frowned. "May I help you?"</p>
		<p>"Um, yes," Delores said, looking up with surprise. "How did you
			know?"</p>
		<p>"I heard your?" Ronnie paused as she tried to think of a tactful term
			for the bucket of junk. "?car?park in my driveway. What do you want?"</p>
		<p>"I'm looking for someone and I was told you would know where she is. Her name is
			Rose Grayson."</p>
		<p>"Who told you that I would know where she is?" Ronnie now knew who the woman
			standing before her was and she was not the least bit happy with the revelation. She had
			promised to bring Rose's checkbook to the hospital but with the unexpected release and
			everything that had happened since, there had not been any more mention of the subject. As
			far as Ronnie knew, Rose had not mailed out anything since coming to her home. So how did
			this leech find her?</p>
		<p>"I stopped at her old apartment and they told me you had paid her rent."
			Delores shivered and looked pointedly at the door. "Can I come in? It's pretty cold
			out here, you know."</p>
		<p>Ronnie mentally cursed whoever it was that created manners and stepped back, holding
			the door open. "Come in, Miss??"</p>
		<p>"Bickering, Delores Bickering," the rotund woman said, walking past the
			executive and pulling her knit cap off to reveal straight brown hair that looked in need
			of a good cleaning. "So you're V. Cartwright?"</p>
		<p>"Yes," Ronnie said without bothering to elaborate further. Now she was faced
			with a moral dilemma. She could pretend Rose was not here and send Delores packing, but
			that risked upsetting the young woman. Then again, she was not sure she wanted to let the
			vulture near her companion. Reluctantly she accepted that the decision was not really hers
			to make. "Wait here."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ronnie crossed the room and entered the office, making sure to close the door behind
			her. She knelt onto the bed and placed her hand on the sleeping woman's shoulder.
			"Rose?Rose honey, wake up."</p>
		<p>"Hmm?" Green eyes opened and blinked wearily.</p>
		<p>"We have company, you have to get up."</p>
		<p>"Company?" She gave a healthy yawn and rubbed her eyes. "Who?"</p>
		<p>"Delores." Ronnie did her best not to let her annoyance show through.</p>
		<p>"Delores? Bickering? Here?" Rose's eyes widened.</p>
		<p>"Delores. Bickering. Here." She watched as the words sank in and the blonde's
			demeanor changed. "Hey, if you don't want to see her?"</p>
		<p>"No, if she went to all this trouble to find me then I owe her at least that
			much."</p>
		<p>"Rose." She took the younger woman's chin in her hand. "You don't owe
			her a thing. Whatever she did for you in the past you've already paid back and then some,
			I'm sure." She gentled her tone, realizing it was not helping. "I'm sorry, I
			know you feel you owe her and I shouldn't be telling you how to think or feel." She
			withdrew her hand and sat back. "I just don't like to see you being used and I'm
			afraid that's exactly why Delores is here." She picked up the brush and began to
			straighten out Rose's sleep-mussed hair.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Mm?"</p>
		<p>"Would it be too much to ask if I could borrow the shirt you wore yesterday? I can
			cover the rest of my body with a blanket."</p>
		<p>"It will be a little big on you but it's fine with me." She leaned back and
			used her long arm to pluck the gray button down shirt from its position across the back of
			the chair. Rose pulled off the nightshirt at the same time and when Ronnie straightened up
			she was greeted to the sight of firm young breasts. She reluctantly tried to keep herself
			from staring by concentrating on helping Rose get her arms through the sleeves. "I'll
			let you button it up while I get the chair ready," she said abruptly, leaving the bed
			and retrieving the folded up wheelchair from the corner. A few minutes later Rose was
			comfortably settled in her chair, the afghan tucked neatly around her legs and hips.
			"You ready?" Ronnie asked.</p>
		<p>"Yeah," came the half-hearted reply. The last person she wanted to see was
			Delores. She hadn't replied to the last letter and had no doubt in her mind the former
			foster mother would bring up the subject of money, especially after finding out where she
			was living. "Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"Could you?I mean, if you don't mind, would you?stay with me?" She
			hoped Ronnie's presence would keep Delores from asking about money, but more than that,
			she wanted the emotional support she knew her friend would give. She smiled when she felt
			the warm hand squeeze her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"I'll be right there, don't you worry," Ronnie said.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Delores turned from her inspection of the various ornaments still dangling from the
			streamers and gasped when she saw Rose in a wheelchair. "What happened to you?"</p>
		<p>"I was hit by a car," the young woman replied. "How did you know where I
			was?"</p>
		<p>"Your landlord told me," she said smugly. "So did you sue the guy who
			hit you?"</p>
		<p>"The police don't know who it was. He took off after the accident."</p>
		<p>"They couldn't find him? That's a shame. If they found him, you could have sued. I
			know a good lawyer that'll help you if you need him. He represented me when I slipped in
			some water in the supermarket. Got me almost four thousand dollars." Delores stepped
			into the sunken part of the living room and flopped down on the leather couch, drawing a
			disapproving look from Ronnie. "So, come tell me what you've been doing. I haven't
			heard from you in almost two months now." She reached into her oversized pocketbook
			and pulled out a worn vinyl cigarette case and lighter, lighting one up without a thought.</p>
		<p>"I don't allow smoking in my home," Ronnie said.</p>
		<p>"Oh, don't worry, I have my own ashtray," Delores replied as she pulled a
			small brown one out of her purse.</p>
		<p>"No, I
			<i>don't</i> allow smoking in my home," the black-haired woman
			stressed, not caring a bit about the glare she received from the large visitor, but caring
			a great deal that Rose did not make a sound of objection.
		</p>
		<p>"Oh, that's fine." Delores took one long drag before butting out the
			cigarette. "So Rose?" She exhaled, filling the air around her with the
			translucent smoke. "How long are you staying with Miss Cartwright, or do you live
			here now?"</p>
		<p>Rose blinked in surprise and looked to her benefactor, asking the same question with
			her eyes. Ronnie swallowed, uncertain of how to answer.
			<i>What do you want, Rose? </i>There
			was no doubt in her own mind that she wanted the fair-haired woman in her life, and in her
			home.
			<i>Does leaving the decision up to me mean that you want it too?</i> Looking into
			Rose's eyes, Ronnie inhaled deeply and took a chance, letting her heart guide her answer.
			"She lives here."
		</p>
		<p>Rose opened her mouth, then closed it, shock taking away her ability to speak for a
			moment. "Y-yes, that's right." Her voice cracked and she fought to keep a smile
			off her face. "So, what brings you up to this area? Visiting Isabel again?" she
			asked, referring to Delores' sister.</p>
		<p>The large woman nodded. "The Tupperware came in. You know she'll never get around
			to delivering it to me. If I don't come down and get them she'll end up using them herself
			or selling them to someone else for the money just like the cookie episode. You remember
			that, don't you, Rose?"</p>
		<p>"Isabel collected all the money for the Girl Scout cookies but didn't have it when
			it came time to pay for them," Rose explained to Ronnie.</p>
		<p>"Sounds like quite a family," the executive said dryly.</p>
		<p>"Not to mention that her kids got into them before they were delivered,"
			Delores added, always ready for a chance to run the rest of her family down, even if she
			were guilty of the same things. "Anyway?" She turned her attention to her
			former foster daughter. "So what do the doctors say? I hope you went to a real
			hospital and not just down to the clinic. You know they don't know anything down there. I
			fought with them for five years over Jimmy and they never did find anything wrong with
			him," Delores said. Rose nodded politely thinking to herself the reason they never
			found anything wrong with her foster brother was there was never anything wrong with him.
			Jimmy was the picture of health during the time she stayed with them, yet Delores dragged
			him from doctor to doctor, insisting that some dreadful rare ailment affected her younger
			son. "You know he's in college now."</p>
		<p>"Really?" Rose had not thought he would make it through high school.
			"What's he majoring in?"</p>
		<p>"Acting. Someday he'll get his own series just like Seinfeld. He even got an offer
			to play downtown," she boasted, as if downtown Cobleskill was anything to brag about.
			"Yup, they're doing Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Andy Gibb played
			the lead on Broadway, you know."</p>
		<p>"Now there's someone to look up to," Ronnie drawled, earning her a slightly
			raised eyebrow from the young woman. She gave Rose a slight pout but quickly returned to
			her normal bored expression as Delores continued to ramble on and fill the young woman in
			on all the trivial events that had happened in her family recently. Eventually, as Ronnie
			suspected it would, the conversation turned to money.</p>
		<p>"You know the state stopped paying for Jimmy when he turned eighteen. It didn't
			occur to them that I needed that extra money each month for the other kids. One in college
			and four other kids still in school."</p>
		<p>"Doesn't Jimmy help out?" Rose queried.</p>
		<p>"He only works weekends at Fred's gas station. He needs that money for gas to get
			back and forth to school."</p>
		<p>"Sounds like Jimmy needs to get another job and help out," Ronnie quipped,
			earning another disapproving, albeit brief, look from Rose. Delores shifted, focusing her
			attention on the young woman and wishing that the dark-haired woman would go away. To her
			delight, it was at that moment the phone rang and Ronnie excused herself for a moment. The
			scheming woman leaned forward in her seat.</p>
		<p>"The State doesn't care. The idiot social worker doesn't care either." She
			paused, sighing for effect. "It's so hard when you're alone, you understand that,
			don't you, Rose?"</p>
		<p>"Yes," she replied. Delores smiled inwardly.</p>
		<p>"You know how hard it was when you were there, all the sacrifices I had to make
			just to keep you and the others out of the state orphanages and group homes." She
			watched, pleased, as Rose nodded.
			<i>The hook is set, now to reel her in</i>, the dumpy
			woman thought. "You must be getting some kind of disability money, aren't you?"
		</p>
		<p>"Actually, no. I didn't get any benefits at Money Slasher and I haven't applied
			for anything." Rose's head drooped, a visible expression of her knowledge as to where
			the conversation was going and her inability to speak up and stop it.</p>
		<p>"But you're living here. You can't tell me someone like her lets you live here
			rent free. You must be paying her something."</p>
		<p>"I think that's a matter between Rose and I," Ronnie said as she reentered
			the room, her tone effectively ending the subject. She did not miss the quick look of
			relief which passed her way from the grateful woman. She also could not miss the way
			Rose's shoulders were slumped.</p>
		<p>"Well I don't see what the big deal is. I just asked a simple question."
			Delores tried to appear hurt, but no one was buying it.</p>
		<p>"And it was answered," Ronnie replied firmly as she took her seat. She
			crossed her arms, making it clear that she was not leaving the room again. She had no
			doubt that if she had not returned the leech would have guilted Rose into giving her
			money. Ronnie would be damned if she were going to let that happen.</p>
		<p>"I think Rose is old enough to speak for herself, don't you?" Delores made no
			attempt to hide her anger. She had only one shot left. "Rose, I think you should come
			stay with me until you recover. I always took such good care of you when you were a
			child."</p>
		<p>There it was. The threat was on the table. Delores was making Rose choose between her
			and Ronnie and the overweight woman was confident the quiet child she once knew and
			controlled would come forth and pick her.</p>
		<p>"I?I?" Rose felt the pressure closing in around her. It had been so
			automatic to do whatever Delores bid for so long. Now she actually had a choice, an option
			to make up her own mind. Submit to the long-standing status quo or plunge forward into the
			unknown with Ronnie. She lifted her head and gazed into soft blue depths, seeing only
			warmth and concern. "I?I don't want to leave." She said it to Ronnie just
			as much as to Delores. She watched the executive release a breath and give a small smile.
			On the other hand, the former foster mother looked furious.</p>
		<p>"Rose, I want to talk to you privately, or does she make all your decisions for
			you?" Delores glared at Ronnie.</p>
		<p>"Rose is her own woman," the black-haired woman said. "I don't control
			her, or manipulate her," she insisted. Her own temper was rising rapidly and Ronnie's
			thoughts centered about throwing the fat woman out on her ear and hopefully out of Rose's
			life.</p>
		<p>"Then why don't you let her tell me that for herself?" Delores snarled,
			visibly upset her plans were crumbling around her. "You don't know how hard I worked
			to keep a roof over her head when no one else would."</p>
		<p>"You took her in because of the extra money from the State. That's all there is to
			it." Ronnie stood up and began pacing. "Have you once asked her if there's
			anything you could do to help her? No, you asked what happened and then went into your own
			little world of problems, half of which would be solved if you got off your lazy ass and
			got a job instead of living off of everyone else." She deliberately avoided looking
			at Rose, certain she would see disapproval in her eyes. She knew she should stop, let her
			friend fight her own battles, but she would be damned if she was going to let Delores
			Bickering bully Rose into giving her one more cent.</p>
		<p>"I don't have to listen to this," the large woman said angrily, rising to her
			feet and retrieving her pocketbook. "Rose, you're letting this bitch control you.
			You're going to turn your back on me? On the only family you have?" She stepped up
			onto the main level and headed for the door. "After everything I've done for
			you."</p>
		<p>Rose let a lone tear slip down her cheek. "Wait." She looked up at Ronnie.
			"Please?"</p>
		<p>"Rose," the dark-haired woman protested, "you don't have to do
			this."</p>
		<p>"Please, just a few minutes. I'll be all right." She winced inwardly at the
			hurt look on Ronnie's face but knew she needed to do this.</p>
		<p>It went completely against her better judgment but finally Ronnie nodded. "I'll be
			downstairs." She shot a murderous look at Delores before leaving the room.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Hrmmpf," Delores grunted as she returned to her seat. "I don't know,
			Rose. These rich people, they think they can control everyone just because they have
			money."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie is not like that," the young woman protested.</p>
		<p>"She won't let you speak for yourself. You are a grown woman. What you do with
			your money is your business, not hers." She reached into her bag and pulled out her
			cigarette case. "You would think you were a child the way she treats you."</p>
		<p>"Delores, please don't." Rose pointed at the cigarette case.</p>
		<p>"Obviously she doesn't know how to treat guests either," the large woman
			grumbled, shoving the case back into her purse. "Well, I can't stay long. I have to
			pick up the Tupperware and hope I have enough gas to get home."</p>
		<p>"Delores, you understand I'm not working? I don't have any money."</p>
		<p>"Rose, you live here. You can't tell me if you needed something she wouldn't help
			you out." The large woman pointed out the obvious. "You're not going to
			starve?or run out of gas on some lonely stretch of highway on the way
			home?" Delores paused for effect. "I remember the time it was snowing and I
			had to take you to the doctor's for?what was it again?"</p>
		<p>"Strep throat," Rose replied sullenly, knowing full well the older woman
			remembered.</p>
		<p>"That's right. I had to get prescriptions for both you and Jimmy because he hadn't
			had it yet. I couldn't afford to go to bingo that week because of that, you know."</p>
		<p>"I know."</p>
		<p>"You know, the coverall is worth two hundred fifty dollars and I had just as much
			chance to win it as anyone else in that room."</p>
		<p>"I know," Rose repeated, sinking further and further into the role she knew
			so well.</p>
		<p>"You know how scared little Jessica will get if I don't come home?"</p>
		<p>Whatever strength and reserve Rose had crumbled with the last implied threat. Jessica
			was nine and very much attached to her mother. "How much do you need?"</p>
		<p>Delores relaxed against the couch, triumphant. "At least thirty dollars."</p>
		<p>"I don't have that much," the young woman lied.</p>
		<p>"Well how much do you have?"</p>
		<p>Rose thought quickly. "The most I can spare is fifteen dollars."</p>
		<p>"Well if that's all you can do then I guess that'll have to do."</p>
		<p>"I'll get my checkbook." Hanging her head in defeat, she turned her chair and
			wheeled her way into the office, returning a few minutes later with the check lying on her
			lap. Delores already had her coat on.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Rose. I hope to hear from you on Christmas." Delores reached for
			the check only to have the young woman jerk it out of reach.</p>
		<p>"Wait?" she summoned her courage and took a deep breath. "I?I
			really can not afford to give you any more money after this."</p>
		<p>Delores' smile changed to an angry snarl. "Fine, I'll remember if I end up with no
			food or anything I shouldn't call you for help." She leaned forward and snatched the
			check out of Rose's hand. Now, having what she came for, Delores was ready to leave, but
			she would do her best to reinforce her hold over the young woman. Her voice became shrill,
			accusatory. "You just remember that while you are sitting here in all
			this?" she spread her arms out to encompass the room, "that I struggled and
			suffered to take care of you for so long." Delores opened the door, letting in the
			cold air. "I hope you get back on your feet soon, Rose. Perhaps someday you will stop
			being so selfish and realize just how much it took for me to keep a roof over your
			head." The door shut and soon Rose heard the sound of an engine straining to turn
			over. After a few false starts and a backfire accompanied by a cloud of black smoke from
			the rusted-out tailpipe, the station wagon backed out of the driveway and headed down the
			street.</p>
		<p>The door to the basement opened and Ronnie appeared, looking about for her unwelcome
			guest.</p>
		<p>"She's gone," Rose said in response to the raised eyebrow. Worried her
			benefactor would be upset about the check, she hid the checkbook beneath the cover of the
			afghan. "Ronnie, I'm sorry about?"</p>
		<p>"No, don't worry about it," the older woman replied, cutting off the apology.
			"You had no way of knowing she would show up here." She walked over to stand
			behind the wheelchair. "You hungry?" she asked. "Never mind, silly
			question." </p>
		<p>"What can I say? Maria's a great cook," Rose replied. Her beaming smile
			earned a quick hair tousle from her companion.</p>
		<p>"Okay, you head on in and find something on the tube while I see what goodies
			Maria left for us."</p>
		<p>Nothing more was said about Delores Bickering as the day progressed, both women far
			more interested in lying side by side on the bed and watching television together. It was
			only after night had fallen and both were settling down to sleep Rose broached the
			subject.</p>
		<p>"Ronnie?"</p>
		<p>"Mmm?"</p>
		<p>"Would you be mad at me if I told you I ended up giving Delores money?"</p>
		<p>"I don't think I could ever be mad at you," Ronnie admitted, rolling onto her
			side and propping her head up with her hand.</p>
		<p>"Disappointed?"</p>
		<p>"No," she sighed. "Rose, if I seemed short or aggravated or?"</p>
		<p>"Hostile?" the younger woman offered. Ronnie looked at the shadowed form in
			the dim moonlight and arched an eyebrow.</p>
		<p>"I don't think I was hostile, Rose. I think I did a great job of being civil to
			the witch, especially considering what I really wanted to do was throw her out into the
			snow bank."</p>
		<p>Rose reached out in the darkness and ran her knuckles up and down the forearm Ronnie
			was propped up on. "I know you did?and I appreciate it."</p>
		<p>"I don't like to see anyone use you, Rose," she whispered. "You deserve
			better than that." Ronnie hesitated for a moment before continuing. "So how much
			did she take?"</p>
		<p>"Fifteen bucks," was the reply. "But I told her this was the last
			time," Rose added quickly.</p>
		<p>"Have you ever told her that before?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Well then, that's a start, anyway." She reached over with her free hand and
			softly cupped Rose's cheek. "Hey, I understand, I really do. It's hard to say no
			after saying yes for so long. Look at me and my family."</p>
		<p>"So you're really not upset with me?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie leaned over and gave her young friend a hug. "I could never be upset with
			you," she whispered into Rose's ear. She did not expect to feel arms wrap around her
			neck and pull her close.</p>
		<p>"I don't know what I ever did to deserve a best friend as good as you," the
			young woman choked as her grip tightened. Ronnie returned the embrace, smiling at first
			with the feeling of holding Rose. Then memories came unbidden to her mind?a flash of
			blue flying over the hood and into the windshield, blood pooling on the ground, and a
			series of lies designed to cover up the truth. The smile faded, replaced with a look of
			sadness.</p>
		<p>"I am the one that doesn't deserve you," Ronnie whispered. She held on for a
			moment longer before rolling back to her side of the bed. "It's time for us to get
			some sleep."</p>
		<p>Despite her intentions when she closed her eyes, Ronnie's body betrayed her as it did
			every night. Just as Rose was drifting off she felt the warm weight of the older woman's
			arm flop across her stomach and warm breath caressing her shoulder. She smiled and allowed
			sleep to claim her. Deep in the land of dreams, they let the warmth of each other's bodies
			fight off the night chill the two and a half century old home couldn't keep at bay.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Ronnie, got a sec?" Susan asked as she stepped into the office.
			"There's a claim here that doesn't make any sense."</p>
		<p>"Since when do you come to me about something like that?" She asked, not
			bothering to look up from the computer screen.</p>
		<p>"Since it involves lost materials and equipment totaling over a hundred thousand
			dollars."</p>
		<p>"What?" Ronnie turned from the computer and motioned for her sister to take a
			seat in the chair on the other side of the desk.</p>
		<p>"Orbison Contractors filed a claim for lost equipment and materials from that
			mini-mall remodeling site. They say that everything from lumber and tools to a brand new
			work truck were stolen." She handed Ronnie a copy of the multi-page claim form.
			"Since they had full protection with us, they also are filing for lost wages due to
			lack of equipment."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure this is legit? Maybe they're just trying to put one over for the
			insurance money." Ronnie flipped through the pages, frowning at each figure.
			"Did they file a report with the police?"</p>
		<p>"Sure did. They found the truck, stripped to the metal out in Arbor Hill."</p>
		<p>Ronnie read the report carefully, looking for any clue that it was a fraud. "Does
			Tommy know about this?"</p>
		<p>"No. I can't reach him. I've left messages everywhere for him."</p>
		<p>"He's probably still drugged up from all the Percocet he stole from my house
			during the Christmas party," the executive grumbled.</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing, never mind." Ronnie's teeth sank into the soft wood of her pencil
			while she continued to pore over the report. No sign of forced entry, not that much was
			needed to get past a simple chain link fence surrounding the work site. The truck was a
			total loss and there was no sign of inflated figures for the missing tools and materials.
			"I can't see anything out of the ordinary here, Sis. Other than the cost, what is it
			that?s bothering you?"</p>
		<p>"I ran a check against the reports we have on file and from what I can see, that
			project should have been finished or almost close to it. But according to the loss report,
			they had barely started. I gave Mike Orbison a call and he said they were at least six
			weeks away from completion."</p>
		<p>"If they were so far away from being finished?." Ronnie looked at the
			paper again. "Then why was so much stuff there? Look at this?all the large panes
			of glass, paint, sheet-rock, even carpeting. I thought those were the last things to be
			delivered."</p>
		<p>"That's what I thought. Maybe they expected to be finished before this."</p>
		<p>"No?Mike's been in business long enough to know exactly what he needs and
			when he needs it. I can't imagine him ordering stuff to be brought on site without it
			being used right away. He knows how easily things are stolen from construction
			sites." Ronnie's brow furrowed as she tried to make sense out of the puzzle.
			"And you're sure these things were on the site?"</p>
		<p>"I can't imagine him lying to us after all this time. His family has worked for us
			since the 60's and this is only the fifth time they have ever filed a claim."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure it's the first time it was in the six figures." Ronnie picked up
			the phone. "Laura, get hold of Mike Orbison for me." A minute later the buzzer
			and flashing light announced the task was accomplished. "Mike? Veronica
			Cartwright?fine and yourself? Good. Mike, I wanted to talk to you about this claim
			you filed with Cartwright Insurance. Sure, I understand that?yes, that seemed strange
			to me too, that is why I wanted to call you?no, there's no problem with
			that?.yes?absolutely?uh huh?yes?no, I didn't know that?.uh
			huh?when was this?"</p>
		<p>"What's going on?" Susan queried, drawing a frown from her sister.</p>
		<p>"Yes Mike, I'm still here, go on?.uh huh?.when did you talk to him last?
			I see?Mike, let me ask you something, other than your people, who else had keys to
			the building? What? Well when did this happen? Did you ask him about it? When? And that's
			the last time you talked to him? Okay Mike?no, I understand perfectly?.of
			course?you too?yes, say hi to Sarah for me?.okay Mike, good-bye."
			Ronnie hung up the phone and sighed.</p>
		<p>"So what did he say?"</p>
		<p>"He said everything was ordered weeks in advance but Tommy kept pushing the dates
			back, that is why everything was on site when the robbery happened. Did the police report
			say whether the truck was hot-wired or not?"</p>
		<p>"I don't think so. I didn't pay that much attention to it, why?"</p>
		<p>"Mike said that Tommy stopped by there last week and after he left a set of keys
			turned up missing."</p>
		<p>"Keys for what?"</p>
		<p>"The building, the truck, the equipment boxes, everything. Mike said they were on
			his desk when Tommy stopped by but he couldn't find them later that day."</p>
		<p>"Ronnie, you don't think?."</p>
		<p>"That is exactly what I think." The dark-haired woman rose and went to the
			window, the bright sun reflecting off the snow banks below. "Susan, I want you to
			contact all the other contractors and tell them to deal with me directly from now on,
			instead of Tommy. If he shows up anywhere, I want to know about it."</p>
		<p>"Why would he steal? It's not like he needs money."</p>
		<p>"He stole from me!" Ronnie growled angrily. "Why are you defending him?
			The truth is right in front of your face." The phone buzzer interrupted her tirade.
			"What?"</p>
		<p>"John Means from Means Auditing on line one," Laura replied.</p>
		<p>"Terrific." She slumped down in her chair and picked up the receiver.
			"This had better be good news," she said before pressing the button. "This
			is Veronica Cartwright."</p>
		<p>Ten minutes later a furious Veronica and a shocked Susan stared at each other.</p>
		<p>"Now do you believe me?"</p>
		<p>"I can't believe he would steal from his own family," the redhead replied
			quietly.</p>
		<p>"Well he did. A few more weeks and he would have crippled the Real Estate
			division, not to mention what it would have done to the company as a whole. We'll be lucky
			to post a profit this quarter."</p>
		<p>"What could he possibly need with that much money?"</p>
		<p>"What do you think, Susan? You're the one who mentioned drugs last week."</p>
		<p>"I know I said it but I didn't really believe it."</p>
		<p>"Well, you should have." Ronnie picked up the phone and buzzed her secretary.
			"Laura, I want you to call the security company and the locksmith. I want all the
			locks changed and Tommy's key codes blocked before the end of the day. Call downstairs and
			make sure no one lets him in. Then call all the heads in for a meeting. I don't care what
			time, just make sure everyone is there."</p>
		<p>"I just can't believe it," the younger sister repeated.</p>
		<p>"Believe it. Our baby brother is a thief and a liar and I'll be damned if he's
			going to get away with it."</p>
		<p>By the end of the day all the locks had been changed and the news broken to the rest of
			the family. Ronnie shut down every construction project until further notice and announced
			that Frank's brother John would run the Real Estate Division until a suitable replacement
			could be found. As an added precaution, she called the bank and reported Tommy's corporate
			credit card stolen only to find out that large cash advances had been taken on the card
			during the last two weeks and it had reached its limit. Yet another piece of information
			to add to Ronnie's already pounding headache of problems.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"What about a nice scarf?"</p>
		<p>"She'll hate it."</p>
		<p>"Hmm?what about a bottle of her favorite perfume?"</p>
		<p>"Ugh, I hate her perfume."</p>
		<p>"Well, what does she like?" Rose flipped through the glossy pages of the
			Macy's catalog. "They've got some pretty jewelry in here." They had spent the
			last two hours flipping through the various catalogs and flyers, to no avail. Everything
			suggested was dismissed just as quickly and Rose was running out of ideas to help her
			friend.</p>
		<p>"No. Mother's got more jewelry than she knows what to do with." Ronnie tossed
			the Bloomingdale's catalog on the desk, picked up another, and sighed. "I hate
			Christmas."</p>
		<p>"Oh, don't be a grump now, I promise to help you find something for her."
			Rose gave her friend a smile. "It can't be that hard to find a present for your
			mother."</p>
		<p>"Beatrice Phoebe Cartwright is without a doubt the hardest woman to buy a present
			for." Ronnie took a sip of wine and placed the long stemmed glass on the desk.
			"Maybe I should just send her on a cruise." Blue eyes twinkled with mischievous
			thought. "Maybe a nice, long cruise."</p>
		<p>"Would she like that?"</p>
		<p>"I would," the executive replied with a devilish grin. "Maybe one of
			those around-the-world tours. You know, maybe six, eight?months."</p>
		<p>"Oh, you. Stop," Rose playfully chastised, reaching out to lightly swat
			Ronnie's forearm. "Your mother is not that bad, she's just a little?a
			little?." She put her finger to her lips, trying to figure out one or two words
			that could accurately describe her friend's mother. "Stuffy."</p>
		<p>"My mother is a snob, Hon." Ronnie said as she took another sip of the ros
			wine. "She doesn't take no for an answer, she expects perfection all the time, and
			worries more about the family image than how we feel." Another sip, "Maybe I
			should just get her a gift certificate and let her pick out what she wants."</p>
		<p>"Are you sure?" Rose flipped a page in the catalog and held it out for the
			older woman to see. "Here. There's a toll free number you can call to order one, if
			that's what you really want to do," she said, her tone making it clear that she did
			not believe that to be the case. Despite having only known her for three weeks, Rose was
			beginning to understand some of the little facial expressions and mannerisms that betrayed
			Ronnie's true feelings. Pencil gnawing meant frustration, fingernail tapping equated to
			boredom, and the firm yet gentle embrace that held her each night spoke of something
			neither of them would dare put words to.</p>
		<p>Blue eyes looked up from the liquid for a moment, then back down again. "No,"
			Ronnie grudgingly admitted. "I just hate feeling so much pressure. I feel like I have
			to get the perfect gift."</p>
		<p>She opened her mouth to protest, then closed it, realizing that in her friend's family,
			it was not far from being the truth. The Christmas party proved that. Not only was the
			entire thing thrust upon Ronnie's shoulders, there had been no sense of appreciation from
			Susan and Beatrice for all the effort. Rose decided perhaps a different tactic was called
			for. "Okay then, what is the perfect gift?"</p>
		<p>Ronnie's eyebrows lifted, not expecting this reaction from the fair-haired woman.
			"Um?I don't know, something?something?." She motioned with her
			hands, causing the wine to slosh about inside the glass. "I guess I never really
			thought about it."</p>
		<p>"Well then, let's think about it. Come over here." Rose raised the head level
			of the bed until she was almost in a sitting position and patted the space next to her,
			booting Tabitha off in the process. "Come on, if the only thing you can get her is a
			perfect gift than let's find one." She turned the pages. "Maybe the trick is to
			get the perfect gifts, you know, a collection of things that she likes instead of one big
			gift. Bring a pen, I'll mark anything we find."</p>
		<p>Ronnie reached for something to write with, but all her pencils were gnawed and there
			wasn't a pen in sight. She lifted a small pile of papers on her cluttered desk but no pen
			appeared. Opening the drawer showed paper clips, spare staples, even a pile of Post-It
			notes, but nothing to write with. "President of a multi-million dollar corporation
			and I can't find a pen when I need it." She continued her search unaware of the page
			Rose was looking at.</p>
		<p>
			<i>That's it!</i> Rose thought excitedly. There before her eyes were pen and pencil
			sets in a multitude of price ranges and designs. The Mont Blanc sets were exquisite but
			completely beyond her meager spending level. She turned the page and saw it. There in the
			center of the page was a nice set, a marble design in a shade of blue that reminded Rose
			of the brilliance of her best friend's eyes. Hesitantly she focused on the price written
			in smaller print below and gulped. It would take most of her remaining funds. She looked
			up to see Ronnie hunting for the still elusive pen, then back down at the catalog. The
			problem of finding a present for Beatrice had not been solved but another problem had.
			Rose discreetly bent the bottom corner of the page, then flipped back to the jewelry just
			as Ronnie found the missing pen and came over to the bed. Rose took the offered ball point
			and moved the catalog so the older woman could see. "Now, let's figure this thing
			out. What's your mother's favorite place to visit?"
		</p>
		<p>"Europe. She's taken two of those country by country tours and raved about both of
			them." Ronnie smiled and, the tension and worry of the last few days drained away
			from her face. "That's it! She'd love it. A tour of Europe. I can't believe I didn't
			think of it before." She took the catalog from Rose and began flipping through the
			pages.</p>
		<p>"Wow?that?that's a wonderful gift." She tried hard not to seem too
			awestruck but it showed in her expression nonetheless.</p>
		<p>"You think that's enough?" Ronnie asked as she looked at the glossy pictures,
			unaware that Rose, used to thinking in terms of pennies, was now trying to fathom the
			thousands of dollars a trip like that would cost. "I was thinking maybe a new
			wardrobe or?" She looked up and was struck by the beauty that gazed back at her.
			They studied each other for several seconds before Rose gave a shy smile and looked away.</p>
		<p>"So um?" She picked at a non-existent piece of lint on the blanket as a
			slow flush crept up her cheeks. "You said something about clothes?"</p>
		<p>"Um?yeah, clothes." Ronnie closed the catalog, no longer having any
			interest in picking out presents. What she wanted to do was shut off the lights and curl
			up against the younger woman. "You know, it's getting late."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I guess it is." Out in the living room, the grandfather clock
			announced the ten o'clock hour but both women chose to pretend not to hear it. Rose
			reclined the bed into a sleeping position while Ronnie ran around shutting off lights and
			checking the locks on the doors. Within minutes the house was dark and they were lying in
			bed together.</p>
		<p>Staring up at the blackness, Rose thought about what had happened earlier. For that
			brief moment there had been something?special between them. She heard the sound of a
			fist punching a pillow and wished Ronnie would just roll over and hold her but that
			usually did not happen until she was almost asleep.</p>
		<p>Ronnie tossed and turned enough for the both of them. One particular toss jarred the
			injured legs and the young woman hissed at the sudden pain. "I'm sorry, Rose. I just
			can't seem to get comfortable tonight."</p>
		<p>"It's all right. It just hurt for a second, that's all." She was glad it was
			dark as a tear slipped out.</p>
		<p>"I'll go out on the couch." Ronnie moved to get up but was stopped by the
			feel of the young woman's hand on her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Why don't you just put your arm around me like you usually do? You seem to go to
			sleep just fine after that." She gave a gentle tug on the older woman's top.
			"Come on Ronnie, you know you'll only end up coming back in here after I'm asleep and
			holding me anyway." Such had been the case a few nights ago. Slowly, reluctantly the
			weight next to her shifted and she felt the familiar warmth of Ronnie's body against hers.
			A second later and her wish came true as a strong arm draped itself over her belly. Rose
			let out a contented sigh and closed her eyes. By the time Tabitha decided they were done
			moving about and jumped back up on the bed, both women were sound asleep.</p>
