<P>AN: Wow I got a lot more of a response then I thought I would. Since I received so much lovely feedback I'm gonna make this a story…preferably kinda long. I'm still not sure on the length but I do know the direction I want to head in. Since I'm finishing up school and I have track practice every night I will probably only be able to update on the weekends. Thank you soooo much for the feedback!</P><P><U>Chapter 2</U></P><P>(Kate POV)</P><P>Beep. Beep. Beep. I jump out of bed and slam my alarm clock. Are you kidding me? Everything that happened was a dream? Ugh I hate my life! I put off going to school for as long as I could and finally faced reality.</P><P>When I get to school I am sadder than normal because I know everything is back to normal. Just another day of me pining for Beth. If wanting her was an art, then I would definitely be an artist. I'm not sure if I've mentioned it yet, but Beth is one of my best friends. Along with Carrie and Heather. After the whole John thing, we all became inseparable. I think that Carrie and Heather know how much I want Beth, in fact the whole school knows. The only one who is completely oblivious is Beth.</P><P>No one really knows which way Beth's sexuality goes. It's clear that she flirts with anything that moves but if she would actually go for it would be a whole other story. It's not like anyone would care if she was bi or lesbian. People are so used to it around here that it doesn't even faze them.</P><P>I think one of the reasons that Beth is so alluring is because she is so mysterious. If you tried to peg exactly who she was, you wouldn't be able to. She's like a brilliant bright light that you want so much but it seems to be just out of you grasp. I dare anyone to say that she is not the most beautiful person they have ever seen.</P><P>So if you can't tell by now, I have it bad for Beth. What kills me is that she will never know and that she will never see me as more than her best friend because I am not willing to risk our friendship over something like this that may not even last. Some days are better than others and I think that I may actually be able to get over her one day, but in the end it always comes back to her.</P><P>Anyways, sorry about getting off topic there, but I could go on about Beth all day long. A lot of the time I wish that she knew how I felt but other times when I feel how strong our friendship is, I know that nothing could be worth messing it up.</P><P>Speak of the devil, she's coming this way to talk to me like always.</P><P>"Hey Kate. How was your weekend?"</P><P>Focus Kate! "Um…normal and boring. Yours?"</P><P>She grinned, "Nothing too exciting. I just went on a date with Josh from my animal rights club."</P><P>I feel my stomach turn because I'm sure that he got something special out of that date. It's nothing knew….that's Beth's style. Shit!  She's giving me a confused look, I must have forgotten to hide my emotions with those inner thoughts.</P><P>Time to become the perfect actress. I simply smirk and say, "Nothing special, huh? I'm sure that still called for some casual sex, am I right?"</P><P>She also smirks and just rolls her eyes, "Whatever, you know everyone wants a piece of me, Spencer."</P><P>I couldn't agree with you more. Of course, I could never say that. "Ha ha…good one Beth!"</P><P>She gives me a fake glare before breaking into a smile and also laughing.</P><P>"Anyways…I came to talk to you for a reason. My parents are having a ton of business guests over at our house this week so I was wondering if I could come and stay with you? Please, I'm begging you. You have no idea how crowded and boring it's gonna be at home."</P><P>I can't help but smile at the way she is acting…it's really too cute.  "Are you kidding? You know you're always welcome at my house.  Sometimes I think my mom loves you more than me."</P><P>"Okay great. Well I have to get to class but after I'll swing by my place to pick up some stuff, then I'll head over to yours."</P><P>"Sounds great." We say goodbye and I watch her walk away.</P><P>Oh No! I just realized that I'm going to be living with her for a whole week. It's going to take some serious self control to keep from telling her how I feel. There's also one other large problem…..every time I'm around her I can hardly keep myself from jumping her on the spot. This is going to be one interesting week!</P><P>An: There you go. The end of chapter two and I think it's a little longer.  Sorry to those of you who were sad that it was a dream…we can't ruin all the fun by having them get together in the beginning. Until next time!</P>
