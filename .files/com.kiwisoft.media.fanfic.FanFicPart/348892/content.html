<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 28 - Unwanted Visitors-->

<P>As the archway disappeared, B'Elanna found herself in a familiar setting; the
sun setting, the breeze cool, and her and Seven lying together on the grass.</P>
<P>Seven had her arm wrapped possessively around the holo-B'Elanna. She had
fallen asleep, content to stay in this make-believe world forever.</P>
<P>B'Elanna noticed that every detail was just as it was on the planet, even
down to Seven's injured arm. </P>
<P>"Computer," B'Elanna choked back a tear, "delete character Lt. B'Elanna
Torres and re-lock holo-deck 2 with Seven's Borg encryption codes."</P>
<P>The holo-B'Elanna vanished along with her Starfleet jacket that was covering
the both of them. Seven immediately began to notice the missing presence and
began reaching out for the holo-B'Elanna. B'Elanna took off her jacket and
covered Seven with it. Lying down next to Seven, she allowed Seven's arms to
encircle her, calming the young Borg down.</P>
<P>Noticing her Comm badge still on her jacket, B'Elanna grabbed it, opened it
up and deactivated it.</P>
<P>"Sorry Tuvok, your wife's gonna have to wait another day," B'Elanna whispered
to herself as she slipped the ring off her finger, tucked it away inside the
Comm badge, set it aside on the ground, and snuggled up to Seven.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Lt. Torres."</P>
<P>Tuvok waited anxiously for a response in his quarters, but none came.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Lt. Torres, are you alright?"</P>
<P>Still no response.</P>
<P>"Computer, locate Lt. Torres."</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres is in holo-deck 2."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway entered cargo bay 2, after a couple hours of pacing around in her
quarters, only to find Seven not regenerating. </P>
<P>"Janeway to Seven Nine."</P>
<P>No response.</P>
<P>"Computer, locate Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is in holo-deck 2."</P>
<P>Janeway turned and headed out of cargo bay 2, but she was stopped by Tuvok's
voice.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Captain Janeway."</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway here. What's the problem?"</P>
<P>"It's interesting that you assume there is always a problem when I contact
you."</P>
<P>"Well, isn't there?"</P>
<P>"Fair enough. I believe we have a problem involving Lt. Torres and Seven of
Nine."</P>
<P>"What kind of problem?"</P>
<P>"It appears that Seven of Nine has locked herself and Lt. Torres inside of
holo-deck 2."</P>
<P>"You mean B'Elanna's in there alone with Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes. Shall I assemble the security team?"</P>
<P>"Yes, immediately. Have them meet us outside the holo-deck."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway approached holo-deck 2, where Tuvok and his security team had been
waiting, "What's the situation?" Janeway asked in mid-stride.</P>
<P>Tuvok answered promptly, "Holo-deck 2 is restricted with Borg encryption
codes and when we tried to de-activate them, a force field was immediately
erected around the entire area."</P>
<P>"So you can't beam them out?"</P>
<P>"We cannot. Ensign Kim is currently working on a way to circumvent the force
field.</P>
<P>"How soon can he get a lock?"</P>
<P>"Unknown. It's curious Captain."</P>
<P>"What's curious?"</P>
<P>"When I asked Lt. Torres to deactivate the Borg encryption codes, a force
field never went up. It's as if Seven of Nine wanted Lt. Torres to break
through."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven stirred restlessly, which caused B'Elanna to wrap her arms even more
tightly around the young Borg.</P>
<P>"Shhh, it's okay Seven," B'Elanna whispered while softly caressing Seven's
holo-graphically injured left shoulder, "It's okay, I'm here."</P>
<P>Upon hearing those words, Seven calmed down. Although she was still asleep,
she could still feel B'Elanna's presence.</P>
<P>B'Elanna had stayed awake and watched the sun set, watching it cast an
orange, red, and finally purple light along Seven's skin. The feeling of melting
into Seven's body almost made her lose consciousness, but she fought to remain
awake, so she could be there when Seven awoke. </P>
<P>The starry sky and partial moon gave B'Elanna all the light she needed to
make out the soft curves of Seven's face, shoulder, and body.</P>
<P>Over and over, B'Elanna ran through what she was going to say, when she was
going to say it, and how she was going to say it. Every word was critical, every
nuance was critical, because right now, everything was critical. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"I'm getting tired of this," Janeway said while pacing back and forth outside
the holo-deck door, "Tuvok, have your team blast their way through this damn
force field, now!"</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna kissed Seven's forehead as she awoke, causing Seven to reciprocate
with a kiss on the lips.</P>
<P>"I love you," B'Elanna whispered.</P>
<P>"I love you too," Seven murmured into B'Elanna's shoulder, "Please don't
leave me?" Seven pleaded desperately, while pulling B'Elanna closer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna could feel the guilt resurfacing and taking control of her body.</P>
<P>"I won't," B'Elanna said while kissing the top of Seven's head, "I
promise."</P>
<P>Seven smiled at the reassurance and snuggled closer, pushing B'Elanna's body
back slightly. Seven's left hand brushed up against a cool metallic object.
Curious, Seven took the object in her hand and brought it around B'Elanna's
body.</P>
<P>"What's this?" Seven asked while looking at the dismantled Comm badge.</P>
<P>"I didn't want us to be disturbed," B'Elanna said while softly brushing a
strand of hair from Seven's face.</P>
<P>Seven opened up the Comm badge and saw the shining engagement ring. Finally
coming to the realization that this was not the holo-B'Elanna, Seven pulled back
from B'Elanna's touch.</P>
<P>"You should not be here."</P>
<P>B'Elanna tried looking Seven in the eyes, but the young Borg would not look
up.</P>
<P>"Seven," B'Elanna reached out to touch her on the shoulder, but Seven pulled
back even further.</P>
<P>"No," Seven shook her head, "I do not want you here."</P>
<P>"If you didn't want me here, why'd you make the password so easy to
guess?"</P>
<P>Seven remained silent while rolling the ring around in her hand.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry Seven. I never meant to hurt you. I just didn't want to break
Tom's heart, that's all."</P>
<P>Seven looked up and dropped the engagement ring, "So instead you decided to
break my heart."</P>
<P>"That's not what I meant Seven."</P>
<P>"Then why did you accept Lt. Paris' proposal?"</P>
<P>"Because I was afraid."</P>
<P>"Afraid of what?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna took a deep breath, "I was afraid of losing you."</P>
<P>"That does not make sense," Seven shook her head. "The very act of accepting
his proposal made you lose me," Seven said while standing up. "Computer, end
program."</P>
<P>The yellow grid and black walls of the holo-deck replaced the light of the
stars and moon. The dismantled Comm badge and engagement ring stood out along
the black floor by Seven's foot.</P>
<P>Seven began walking towards the door when B'Elanna grabbed her by the arm,
"Seven, wait."</P>
<P>Seven looked directly into B'Elanna's eyes, "I believe I have waited long
enough," Seven said while pulling her arm away, turning, and walking towards the
door. "Computer, deactivate Borg encryption codes." </P>
<P>Suddenly phaser fire could be heard bouncing off the holo-deck doors,
followed quickly by Janeway ordering a cease-fire. Then the doors opened and in
rushed Janeway.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The brig was a place B'Elanna thought she'd never see again. It was cramp, it
was quiet, but worst of all, it was lonely, especially since Janeway ordered
that she be kept in solitary confinement. Not even Neelix could see her, and he
was usually pretty good at getting around the Captain's orders. So she sat down
on the rock-hard bed, propped her knees up to her chin, and closed her eyes.
</P>
<P>Next thing B'Elanna knew she was back in her quarters, standing next to the
door.</P>
<P>"Well it's a fine mess you've gotten yourself into now. Isn't it, Bella?" Q
said while lying on his stomach on B'Elanna's bed.</P>
<P>"Q?" B'Elanna turned her head and saw Q completely clad in a red Captain's
uniform, pips and all. "What the hell are you doing here?"</P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and suddenly appeared standing right in front of
B'Elanna, "Oh, I think you know exactly why I'm here."</P>
