<p>Lilly watched as the woman turned away from her, wondering at the pained look in her eyes. Maybe her foot hurt where her partner had stepped on it. Lilly continued watching as they moved farther away from her. Tall, dark and handsome. God, did that description ever fit this woman. Her dark hair reached past her shoulders, with bangs trying to cover her expressive eyes. Her black jeans were snug enough to show off a firm backside and long legs. Lilly continued to stare as they danced away from her.</p>
<p>"Who are you staring at?" Mikayla asked.</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>Mikayla punched her arm making Lilly jump.</p>
<p>"What?" Lilly asked.</p>
<p>"Who are you staring at?"</p>
<p>"A woman," Lilly murmured.</p>
<p>"It's a lesbian bar. I could have guessed that. Who?"</p>
<p>"The brunette, on the end there," she pointed. "She's dancing with that other woman. They can't dance worth a damn. You can't miss them," she said.</p>
<p>"Oh my God! That's Joannie," Mikayla hissed.</p>
<p>"Joannie?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I can't believe it! So it took her a whole week to find someone else. See, I told you. It wasn't meant to be."</p>
<p>"That's Joannie?" Lilly's heart sank. For a second, she had felt a connection, a spark. And apparently it was with Mikayla's Jonnie.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's Joannie. She's cute, isn't she?"</p>
<p>"Very."</p>
<p>"And you're right. They can't dance. But it's not Joannie's fault. She was very good. Must be the taller one's fault."</p>
<p>Lilly's head snapped around.</p>
<p>"The taller brunette? That's not Joannie?"</p>
<p>"Joannie? No, no. She's the shorter one."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank God," Lilly murmured as she grabbed Mikayla's arm.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean, I thought you meant the taller brunette was Joannie. I was looking at the taller woman."</p>
<p>"No. She's not at all my type."</p>
<p>"I know. She's… too tall for you."</p>
<p>"So you were looking at the tall woman? Joannie's date?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm sorry. I didn't know it was your Joannie," Lilly said.</p>
<p>"She's not <i>my</i> Joannie. And I can't believe she's already with someone else."</p>
<p>"Well, as far as Joannie knows, <i>you're</i> with someone else," Lilly stated. "And I thought you were the one that broke it off?"</p>
<p>"I was. And now I see that it was for good reason. She obviously wasn't sincere when she said that she wanted to be with me. God, you can't trust women."</p>
<p>"What do you expect?" Lilly demanded. "You told her to get lost. She did. Can you blame her? And my God, did you look at the woman she's with?"</p>
<p>"She wasn't that cute," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"Cute? She's gorgeous!" Lilly exclaimed.</p>
<p>"She is not. She looks… I don't know. Like a lawyer or something," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>Lilly put her hands on hips and faced her friend. "What exactly are you saying?"</p>
<p>"I'm saying she's dressed like you. She doesn't fit in. She's not at all Joannie's type."</p>
<p>Lilly glanced across the dance floor at the two women sitting at a table alone. She felt drawn to the woman, but it hardly mattered. She had rules. Never date someone you meet at a bar. And certainly never date someone who was dating someone else.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should ask her to dance," Mikayla said.</p>
<p>"Joannie?"</p>
<p>"No! The other one."</p>
<p>"I will not. They are obviously here as a couple."</p>
<p>"They can't be that much of a couple. I was with Joannie last weekend."</p>
<p>"Maybe she had this woman on the side."</p>
<p>"As if."</p>
<p>No. Lilly had to agree. No woman would have this beautiful creature on the side. She would be out front for all to see.</p>
<p>Miley continued to stare across the floor at Mikayla and the dark haired woman, looking away whenever Mikayla glanced their way. Apparently Joannie's plan was working. Mikayla was keeping an eye on her. Or maybe it was something else. Maybe she had felt the connection, too, when their eyes had met that first time. Miley shook her head. It was just her luck. The <i>one</i>. Love at first sight. And she was here as Joannie's date. And they both wanted the same woman.</p>
<p>"Hold my hand," Joannie said. "She's looking."</p>
<p>Miley took her hand, then glanced up. But it was the dark haired woman who was looking, not Mikayla.</p>
<p>"No she's not."</p>
<p>"Yes, she is. God, she's staring right at us."</p>
<p>Miley peeked again. No, just the dark haired woman was looking. Mikayla wasn't even standing there anymore.</p>
<p>"Joannie, she's not even there anymore. Just the dark haired one," Miley said.</p>
<p>"Dark hair?" Joannie hissed. "That's Mikayla!"</p>
<p>"The one with <i>black hair</i> is Mikayla?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Who did you think? Surely not that blonde?"</p>
<p>Miley closed her eyes and laughed. "Let me get this straight. The one with black hair is Mikayla? Not the cute blonde?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you. Thank you." She met Joannie's eyes. "The blonde. She's the one I was staring at. She's the <i>one</i>," she said.</p>
<p>"The <i>blonde</i>?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm going to talk to her, ask her to dance or something."</p>
<p>"Absolutely not!"</p>
<p>"Why the hell not?"</p>
<p>"For one thing, you can't dance. For another, you're here as my <i>date</i>! And apparently that's Mikayla's date."</p>
<p>"No. Our eyes met. There was something there," Miley said.</p>
<p>"You and your love at first sight. Miley, it doesn't exist. Give it up. So your eyes met? Look around the room. You'll meet lots of eyes," Joannie said.</p>
<p>Miley looked over again and the blonde had returned. She watched as the blonde lifted her head, moving her eyes slowly across the room until they landed on Miley. Again, their stare was intense. Miley felt as if this woman were looking into her soul. Then the woman's eyes dropped and Miley followed them… right to her hand still clasped with Joannie's. <i>Damn! </i>She pulled it away quickly, but the woman had turned away.</p>
<p>"Shit," Miley muttered.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous! I'm playing your date to make some other woman jealous and now the blonde thinks we're seeing each other."</p>
<p>"As far as she knows, we are."</p>
<p>"Joannie, I can't go through with this. I have to meet her," Miley insisted.</p>
<p>"Miley, please. I'll look like a total fool if Mikayla finds out. And if you hit on her friend, she'll find out."</p>
<p>"Jesus, Joannie. You can't expect me to just sit here and let her walk away. It's not like I meet someone everyday that… makes my heart stop." Miley watched them, then her eyes widened. "I'm going. Mikayla just walked away."</p>
<p>"Miley, please?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell her I'm cheating on you or something. I have to meet her, Joannie."</p>
<p>Before Joannie could stop her, Miley got up and walked across the room, striding purposefully towards the blonde.</p>
<p><i>Oh my God. She's coming over here</i>. Lilly looked up and locked eyes on the tall woman as she approached. She felt her heart flutter in her chest as those dark eyes bored into hers. She nervously stuck her hands in her pockets but couldn't look away.</p>
<p>The woman stopped in front of her, so close, Lilly could smell her fragrance, could see the laugh lines around her eyes, could see the pulse that throbbed in her neck.</p>
<p>"I would ask you to dance, but… I've been told I have two left feet," Miley finally said when she found her voice. The woman's eyes were bluer than she imagined and she still stared into them. Actually, she wanted to drown there.</p>
<p>Lilly finally found her voice, too. "Wouldn't your girlfriend mind?"</p>
<p>"I don't have a girlfriend." At the blonde's raised eyebrows, Miley remembered her date. "Oh, you mean Joannie. Well, I can explain about that." Then she looked around for Mikayla. "Would <i>your</i> girlfriend mind?"</p>
<p>"Who?" Lilly asked with a frown.</p>
<p>"The dark haired woman."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled and shook her head. "We're just friends."</p>
<p>Miley smiled with relief. "Good." Then, without thinking, she took the blonde's hand and led her out to the dance floor.</p>
<p>"I thought you couldn't dance."</p>
<p>"I can't," Miley said. But she pulled the woman into her arms, her eyes closing as the blonde moved close to her.</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't imagine how she ended up on the dance floor, in this woman's arms, in a matter of seconds. But she hardly cared. Her body had a mind of its own as it practically molded itself to the other woman. She had a hard time catching her breath as the woman's arms circled her waist and she let her own slide up around strong shoulders.</p>
<p>"Please tell me your name," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>Lilly closed her eyes as she felt the woman's breath tickle her ear.</p>
<p>"Lilly," she murmured. She felt the woman nod.</p>
<p>"That's lovely. I'm Miley," she said.</p>
<p>Miley. Yes, it fit her, Lilly thought.</p>
<p>They moved together slowly on the floor, ignoring the other couples as they passed by them. Miley's hands tightened at her waist and Lilly moved closer, gasping at the intimate contact. Never in her life had she reacted to a stranger this way. But her body felt as if it belonged right here, next to this woman. There was no rhythm, no rhyme or reason to their movements. Just two women, two bodies sliding together to the beat of the music. But when their breasts pressed together, Lilly moaned, burying her face against Miley's neck. She couldn't fathom the instant desire she felt for this stranger. A desire that burned slowly down her body, causing her to press even closer to the woman.</p>
<p>Miley heard the soft moan and her breath caught. She closed her eyes as her lips moved softly, slowly across the woman's hair, her cheek. Then Lilly lifted her head and their eyes met. They were both breathing hard and Miley felt Lilly's arms tighten, felt her pull Miley closer. She was lost. Her hungry mouth closed the distance, meeting Lilly's lips with her own.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't think as her mouth opened. Her tongue dueled with Miley's and she nearly collapsed right there in her arms. She groaned as Miley pulled her closer, molding their hips together. She pressed against her hard, letting go of her inhibitions. Their kisses were hot, wet… hungry. Lilly's hands moved into Miley's hair, holding her close. Then suddenly they were bumped from behind and they pulled apart, both their breath coming in ragged gasps.</p>
<p>Their eyes met again, both questioning. They had stopped dancing. They simply stood and stared.</p>
<p>Oh my <i>God!</i> <i>You were making out with a total stranger on the dance floor.</i> <i>Have you lost your mind?</i> Lilly stepped away from Miley, thankful that the song had ended.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you did that," Lilly hissed.</p>
<p>"Did what?"</p>
<p>"Kissed me. I don't even know you."</p>
<p>"You kissed me, too," Miley stated, still breathless.</p>
<p>"I most certainly did not. I don't <i>do</i> that. And your girlfriend… your date is right <i>there</i>," she said, motioning with her head towards Joannie.</p>
<p>"I can explain. Please. Let me explain," Miley begged.</p>
<p>Lilly shoved both hands through her hair. She had been making out with a <i>stranger</i> on the dance floor. Thank God no one knew her here. No one except Mikayla, who was now standing beside them.</p>
<p>"Lilly? What's going on?" Mikayla asked as she looked Miley over head to toe.</p>
<p>"Nothing. Nothing at all."</p>
<p>"I…" But Miley closed her mouth. She looked from Lilly's angry eyes to Mikayla's angry eyes and she wanted to crawl in a hole. Then she looked back to Lilly, staring into the blue eyes that caused her heart to skip.</p>
<p>"Come on," Mikayla said. "I brought you another drink."</p>
<p>"Okay. Thanks," Lilly said. She turned to follow Mikayla, then stopped and looked back at Miley, who still stood there. "Go back to your date," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"Please, I've got to see you again."</p>
<p>"No. I'm not really interested. You're seeing someone."</p>
<p>"I'm . . .." Shit! Joannie would kill her. "I can explain," she said weakly. "Please," she whispered.</p>
<p>Something about the way she nearly begged caused Lilly's heart to catch. She stared at the woman who had been kissing her so thoroughly only moments before. Damn, but she was attractive. And her eyes… so dark, so intense. They held her captive. Oh, hell.</p>
<p>"The woman you're with . . . Mikayla used to date her," Lilly said. "In fact, up until last weekend."</p>
<p>"I know. And it's not what you think," Miley said. "Please, give me a chance to explain."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because.. because of what just happened out there," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>But Lilly shook her head. "I have rules. Never date someone you meet at a bar. Never date someone who's seeing someone else."</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll give you the first one. But the second, I can <i>explain</i>," Miley said again.</p>
<p>"Then that still leaves the first," Lilly said.</p>
<p>"Then let's meet somewhere else. Breakfast. Nine o'clock. Downtown. Saturday morning. How about Clare's?"</p>
<p>"Why in the world would I agree to that?"</p>
<p>"Because you kissed me. And because you want to do it again," Miley whispered.</p>
<p><i>Christ! </i>It was true. "I don't <i>do</i> this," Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>"Do it for me," Miley said. "Please?"</p>
<p>"Shit," Lilly whispered. She was torn. Torn between her rules and this beautiful woman who had nearly kissed her senseless minutes ago. "Okay. Nine." She turned away before she could change her mind.</p>
<p>Miley walked quickly back to their table, meeting the very angry eyes of Joannie. She smiled weakly. Joannie didn't return it.</p>
<p>"She thinks I'm cheating on you," Miley said. "I'm sure Mikayla will be sympathetic about it."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you just did that!"</p>
<p>"If you had any sense at <i>all</i>, you'd just go over there and ask Mikayla to dance. Then we could end this stupid charade."</p>
<p>"Can't you control your hormones for one night? My God! You were practically making out with the woman right there!"</p>
<p>Miley smiled. She couldn't believe it, no. But, yes, they had been.</p>
<p>"Joannie, she's... "</p>
<p>"The one. I know. God, I can't believe you're actually serious when you say that." Joannie leaned closer. "She's a stranger. A woman you met at a bar. You don't even know her."</p>
<p>"But I want to know her," Miley said.</p>
<p>I tried to change all the names correctly, hopefully I got them all. Tell me if I missed one please. Just in case Kate – Lilly, Dana – Joannie, Jamie – Miley, Tess – Mikayla. Thanks for reading</p>
