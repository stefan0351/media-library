<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 14 -->

<p>Brooke unceremoniously dropped her bag in the hallway once she got home and
headed into the kitchen.  Her day had been utter crap, and if she were in a
movie she would have darkly stated that she needed a drink.  Upon entering
the kitchen and finding it already occupied she almost turned right around
but she had been spotted and was addressed before she could make her exit.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Jane asked resting the paper she had been reading on the table
top.  Brooke pasted a smile across her face and walked over to the table
sitting opposite Jane as she mumbled some greeting to the older woman.</p>

<p>"I know I'm old and unhip and that it's no longer cool for kids today to
talk to adults about how their days went, but, I was wondering if something
happened at school today?" she asked tentatively.</p>

<p>"Why would think that?" Brooke asked, forcing a note of curiosity into her
voice.</p>

<p>"Sam came home during lunch with Carmyn.  She looked very shaken up…I think
she had been crying, and now she's barricaded herself up in her room.  The
only evidence I've got that she's till alive up there is that she started
playing Patsy Cline on a continuous loop after Carmyn left," Jane related
worriedly.</p>

<p>"I don't…I mean I haven't really seen her all day," Brooke responded
haltingly, a cold wave passing through her body.</p>

<p>"I know it's asking a lot, but she won't talk to me, and I know that the two
of you have become friends…and I was wondering if you'd try," Jane replied.</p>

<p>"It's not that…I mean it's not a lot to ask…I just don't think that she
wants to talk to me," Brooke said softly, guiltily, however Jane interpreted
the tone as modesty and pressed on.</p>

<p>"I'm just really very worried about her," she went on shaking her head
despondently.  "The last time she played Patsy Cline was after her…" Jane
trailed off there momentarily, but Brooke instinctively knew what the end of
the sentence was: "was after her father died", was what Jane had been about
to say.  "If you could just check on her…" Jane continued a second later.</p>

<p>"I…I'll see what I can do," Brooke responded, then hastily got up making her
exit.</p>
