<!-- The Grrls Club \ Chapter Five: Where To Start. -->

<p><u>Captains Quarters:</u></p>
		<p>"What was in that?" I don't feel drunk any more Kathryn" queried Samantha as she handed Kathryn the hypospray. </p>
		<p>"Argh Starfleet captains special privilege anti alcohol hypospray" chuckled Kathryn as she boosted herself with the spray.</p>
		<p>"I and many others on this ship have been fooled Kathryn, here we are nursing hangovers from shore leave and other parties and you never once got them. We were all left to believe that you were immune, sneaky indeed." Samantha smiled.</p>
		<p>"Well not exactly fooled. You weren't exactly told the truth about anti alcohol hyposprays. I had to beg the Doctor, you know how he is even with me when it comes to self induced hangovers"</p>
		<p>Kathryn put on her best Doctor voice " If the crew and yourself insist on indulging in this tradition then they can suffer the consequences of their/your own actions"</p>
		<p>Samantha laughed, Kathryn continued in her own voice. </p>
		<p>" I had to pull rank on him and threaten him with the deletions of a few special sub routines that he was so very fond of"</p>
		<p>"Hmm but Kathryn" Samantha step forward into Kathryn's personal space. "I don't have any special sub routines for you to bribe me with. So it looks like the crew will just have to find out about secret things"</p>
		<p>Samantha's smile became desirably cute.</p>
		<p>Kathryn found her knees begin to buckle and her heart star to pound, not from worry about the secret from getting out but from the most beautiful woman before her. Kathryn closed the gap between them.</p>
		<p>"So what will I have to do to keep this secret safe Sam?"</p>
		<p>"Well Kathryn" Samantha wrapped her arms around Kathryn's neck "I suppose, for a start you'll have to kiss me again"</p>
		<p><u>Seven's Quarters</u></p>
		<p>"We are here Bella" purred Seven "Outside MY quarters" Seven emphasized the my bit to make sure B'Elanna knew her intentions. "So you can kiss me now!"</p>
		<p>"Inside Seven inside" B'Elanna struggled to get Seven to comply.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna smiled at the pout she was receiving. "I promise that I am going to kiss you like never before Seven"</p>
		<p>Seven quickly stopped pouting and pulled B'Elanna off of her feet and literally threw her in the door.</p>
		<p>"Now! Bella I cannot wait"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna quickly regained her balance. She grabbed Seven around the waist and buried her into Seven's collarbone. B'Elanna's senses were in overdrive. ` Vanilla mmm cinnamon yep that's what she smells like' thought B'Elanna `I wonder if she tastes like it too' B'Elanna nipped and kissed her way around Seven's neck.</p>
		<p>"Oh Bella so good its sooo good" moaned Seven</p>
		<p>As B'Elanna continued her assault up and around Seven's neck. Her fingers began to lightly rub Seven's `Oh so beautiful ` boob. She let her thumb rub back and forward over the now hardening nub.</p>
		<p>"Oh yesss Bella more!" groaned Seven</p>
		<p>Still lightly stroking Seven's nipple, B'Elanna looked up and was rewarded with a beautiful sight. Cherry red lips slightly open, ready oh so ready. She ran her tongue lightly over them, then she lightly nipped the bottom lip. B'Elanna was again rewarded this time with a moan of delight.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna moved her free hand up and entangled it long blonde hair. She increased the pressure on Seven's nipple with her thumb, then she brushed her lips over Seven's.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna deepen the kiss. "I am with Omega' thought Seven. As their tongues began to entwine Seven brought her fingers up to her Bella's nipple. They started to match B'Elanna's rhythm on her own. Their kiss deepened, passionate moans were escaping both lips. B'Elanna was the first to slow the kiss down, gently pulling her lips away from Seven's and slowing her nipple playing down. Both girls reluctantly pulled slightly away from each other. Their arms now wrapped around each other's waists.</p>
		<p>"So Seven was that sufficient?" purred B'Elanna</p>
		<p>Seven looked at the huge grin across her Bella's face. "Mmmmm that was" but before she could finish Seven's world went black and the last thing that she saw was the look of panic across her Bella's face.</p>
		<p>"Shit!!" B'Elanna held onto Seven with all her strength. "shit!" She slowly lowered Seven to the floor and gently placed a pillow under her head.</p>
		<p>"Seven!, Seven! Can you hear me? Seven wake up honey please Seven" B'Elanna started to panic</p>
		<p>"Oh god!, I am going to regret this" She tapped her Comm-badge "Torres to the doctor, Medical emergency in Seven's quarters" And she did regret it because as soon as the blue sparkles materialized into the doctor Seven had begun to come round.</p>
		<p>"Bella?" Seven let her eye's focus "Doctor?" what are you, what happened Bella" Seven's voice had an edge of panic.</p>
		<p>"It seems you have fainted" The Doctor quipped.</p>
		<p>"I do not faint! Bella?"</p>
		<p>"Its ok Seven I am here, your ok." Relief spread over B'Elanna' face. The doctor was running the medical tricorder over Seven's body "Yes fainted and that's my medical opinon it seems Seven that you've indulged in way too much alcohol."</p>
		<p>"Well fix me then doctor, I do not like this fainting. It is getting in the way of more pleasant things" </p>
		<p>The doctor was slightly taken back. He had never seen Seven smile so cheekily ever before, nor had he seen B'Elanna blush that shade.</p>
		<p>"I am not in the habit of fixing self induced alcohol sickness. You'll have to live with it like the rest of the crew, Enjoy the new sensation Seven" with that he dematerialized.</p>
		<p>Seven sat upright. "Oh Bella I suddenly do not feel to good, I am dying! Get him back here"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna had enough alcohol hangovers to know what was coming next by the shade of Seven's face.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna spent the rest of the night hanging Sevens head over the biowaste unit and whispering that every thing would be ok the morning; and thinking of the Doctor's many Sub-routines that she should fix permanently. </p>
