<P>"What's this?" Janeway asked Seven as she removed the silk panties wrapped
around Seven's shoulder and lifted it high in the air.</P>
<P>The young Borg froze, seeing the anger in the Captain's eyes. She felt
trapped in the tiny room alone with the Captain. The only way out was up the
ladder and onto the main floor of the Delta Flyer. </P>
<P>"Umm. Those appear to be a woman's undergarment," Seven responded as casually
as possible.</P>
<P>"I know that. But whose undergarments are these?"</P>
<P>Seven cleared her throat, attempting to buy time. "Well, when we were down on
the planet, we did not have sufficient medical supplies, so it was suggested
that I use my underwear to wrap my wound."</P>
<P>"These are yours?" Janeway asked suspiciously.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven lied.</P>
<P>"I didn't know you wore underwear."</P>
<P>"Neither did I," Seven mumbled to herself.</P>
<P>"What was that?"</P>
<P>"Nothing. I was just clearing my throat."</P>
<P>Janeway eyed Seven from the corner of her eye while going to get the dermal
regenerator. Seven shifted around on the medical table, uncomfortable of the
Captain's gaze. </P>
<P>For some reason Janeway felt Seven was being dishonest, but the Borg had not
lied to her since her very first days on the ship. So there was no reason to
doubt her honesty now. But then again, jealously had a way of making people
paranoid.</P>
<P>"Does that hurt?" Janeway asked Seven, while applying the dermal regenerator
to the Borg's left shoulder.</P>
<P>"Are dermal regenerators suppose to hurt?" Seven responded quirking an
eyebrow.</P>
<P>"No. Stupid question. I just wanted to break the tension."</P>
<P>"Consider it broken."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled at the response and pulled the dermal regenerator away. </P>
<P>"There, should be as good as new," Janeway said, smoothly running her hand
along the newly regenerated skin. </P>
<P>Seven held her breath at the contact and almost let her right hand slip from
covering her chest.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven replied, turning around in her seat and quickly pulling up
her bio-suit. </P>
<P>"Here, let me help you with that," Janeway said, placing both her hands on
Seven's bare shoulders before the Borg could finish covering them.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven complied hesitantly.</P>
<P>Janeway softly let her hands drift from the top of Seven's shoulders, down
along Seven's back to where the zipper was. Ever so slowly, Janeway pulled the
zipper up, covering Seven's skin. At the base of Seven's neck, the Captain
softly brushed away Seven's hair and finished zipping her up.</P>
<P>"All done," Janeway said, patting Seven on the back.</P>
<P>"Thank you Captain."</P>
<P>Seven stood up, turned around to face Janeway, and took a step back.</P>
<P>"I believe we should head up and assist B'Ella…Lt. Torres and Ensign Parker
in flying the Delta Flyer."</P>
<P>Seven swallowed.</P>
<P>Janeway furrowed her brow, looked at Seven and finally responded, "Very
well."</P>
<P>Seven immediately turned and headed for the ladder.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"So the ship went from burning to brand new in a matter of hours?" B'Elanna
asked unbelievingly.</P>
<P>"Yup," Ensign Parker answered.</P>
<P>"Wow. So I guess Seven and I weren't hallucinating then?"</P>
<P>"Why? What happened to you two?" Parker asked eagerly.</P>
<P>"Oh," B'Elanna blushed, thinking about the passionate lovemaking, the
waterfall, and her declaration of love, "Nothing much."</P>
<P>"But you just said you thought you were hallucinating."</P>
<P>"Yeah. I did, didn't I? Well, a basket did appear out of thin air."</P>
<P>"Really?"</P>
<P>"Yup. And I guess that about…" B'Elanna stopped as she saw Seven climbing up
the ladder and onto the main floor.</P>
<P>"About what?" Seven asked, wondering why B'Elanna was staring at her
strangely.</P>
<P>Parker looked back and forth between Lt. Torres and Seven of Nine. Torres
flinched and looked down to ground. In all her years aboard Voyager, Parker had
never ever seen Lt. Torres look down when talking to anyone.</P>
<P>"I… Huh?" B'Elanna asked, forgetting the original question as she looked up
and fell into Seven's deep blue eyes.</P>
<P>"You were saying 'I guess that about,' and then you stopped," Seven
replied.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah, I was just telling Ensign Parker here about the magical basket that
appeared out of nowhere, that's all."</P>
<P>"I see," Seven said casually.</P>
<P>"Hey," Parker whispered conspiratorially to Seven, "Maybe you can fill me in
on all the details that Lt. Torres here isn't telling me?"</P>
<P>Seven quirked an eyebrow and B'Elanna almost jumped out of her seat.</P>
<P>"No!" B'Elanna shouted abruptly.</P>
<P>"No, what?" Janeway asked while popping up from the lower deck.</P>
<P>"No," B'Elanna hesitated momentarily, "We should stop talking and start
heading back to Voyager."</P>
<P>"Good idea," Janeway said sarcastically, "I'm surprised our Chief Engineer
didn't think of that sooner.</P>
<P>B'Elanna could feel the bite in Janeway's statement as she walked up and sat
down next to her at the main console.</P>
<P>"So," Janeway clasped her hands, inverted them and stretched them out, "Are
we going to begin any time soon?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, "Yes Captain."</P>
<P>"Good, because I wouldn't want to interrupt your chit-chat."</P>
<P>B'Elanna bit down on her lower lip and proceeded to launch.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Communications are still down Captain," Seven stated from the secondary
console.</P>
<P>"Don't worry about it, we'll be back on Voyager soon enough," Janeway
answered.</P>
<P>B'Elanna remained unusually quiet as she piloted the ship back to Voyager.
Although quiet, she remained focused on every word that passed between the
Captain and Seven.</P>
<P>"So," Janeway leaned back in her chair, "I was thinking you could join me on
the holo-deck and relax after you've regenerated?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna clenched her left hand under the console. Seven, surprised at the
offer, hesitated a moment when she noticed B'Elanna stiffen.</P>
<P>"I believe that would be unwise Captain," Seven answered smoothly.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway turned in her seat at the unexpected response. "Why's
that?"</P>
<P>"I believe that I should re-assimilate myself to my regular work schedule.
After being gone so long I think routine should be my priority."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smirked as Seven brushed Janeway off, but was unsure as to whether
Seven was serious to going back to her routine on Voyager. Would she forget
everything that happened on the planet? Would she just brush that off as a
momentary lapse in judgement because of the extenuating circumstances? B'Elanna
wondered painfully throughout the rest of the flight.</P>
<P>"Very well," Janeway replied, extremely embarrassed at being rejected and
even more irritated at B'Elanna's smirk.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The docking bay doors opened and the entire senior staff greeted them, but
the Doctor and Tom were front and centre, fighting for position.</P>
<P>After seeing that no one was seriously injured, Tom playfully nudged the
Doctor aside, "Looks like you won't be needed here Doc," Tom said as he held his
right hand behind his back.</P>
<P>"Tom," B'Elanna said, noticing his strange behaviour.</P>
<P>"Well," Tom smiled and spread his left arm wide to his side, "Aren'tcha gonna
give me a hug?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna eyed him suspiciously, "What's your right arm doing behind your
back?"</P>
<P>Seven stared at Tom as well, "Yes Lt. Paris, what are you hiding?" Seven
questioned from behind B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Nice to see you again too Seven."</P>
<P>The Captain's faced glowed with excitement as if a cloud had just lifted.
Down on the planet she had completely forgotten about what Tom told her before
her leaving. Now it had all returned and she couldn't be happier.</P>
<P>"Tom," Janeway threw her arm around his shoulders, "Has a very big
announcement to make."</P>
<P>Janeway looked directly into B'Elanna's eyes and grinned.</P>
<P>"Well," Tom smiled, "If you aren't going to give me that hug, then I guess
there's only one thing left for me to do?" </P>
<P>Tom got down on one knee and pulled the box out from behind his back.
B'Elanna froze, Seven stiffened, and Janeway clasped her hands together. </P>
<P>Using his left hand, Tom opened up the box, exposing the beautiful diamond
ring inside, "B'Elanna Torres, will you marry me?" Tom asked, his face full of
sincerity.</P>
<P>For some reason B'Elanna had expected a long-winded speech about how she had
changed his life, how she was everything to him, how he couldn't live without
her, but he had skipped all of that and just popped the question. </P>
<P>Looking at Tom's face, looking at the faces of Harry, the Doc, Tuvok,
Chakotay, and Neelix, B'Elanna felt more pressure than she'd ever felt in her
entire life. </P>
<P>Seven, meanwhile, stood stiffly several feet behind B'Elanna, her heart
beating rapidly, her breathing completely slowed, and the pressure in her head
on the verge of exploding.</P>
<P>"I..." B'Elanna hesitated while looking at the eager faces of her friends,
"I..." B'Elanna looked at Tom's pleading, hopeful, and sincere face, "I..."
B'Elanna felt all her feelings for Tom re-surface, all the times they'd spent on
the holo-deck, all the times they'd eaten dinner, and all the times they'd spent
breaking Starfleet regulations, "Sure," B'Elanna finally answered, a wave of
guilt crashing down on her.</P>
<P>"Well that doesn't exactly sound like a resounding yes," Harry joked while
the rest of the senior staff laughed, "But I'm sure he'll take it."</P>
<P>Tom furrowed his brow, as he took B'Elanna's hand, slipping the ring on her
finger.</P>
<P>Seven quickly walked by, her body slightly brushing up against B'Elanna's, as
she headed down the corridor to somewhere that wasn't there.</P>
<P>"I guess some people just can't handle the emotional roller-coaster of
proposals," Harry laughed as Seven left.</P>
<P>"Speaking of which, I think I'll be leaving," Tuvok stated, "Congratulations
Lt. Torres and Paris, may you two live long and prosper."</P>
<P>B'Elanna simply nodded, tears filling her eyes, and kept her head down, not
wanting to see Seven's departing form.</P>
