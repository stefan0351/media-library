<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 13 -->

<p>It was a sight for sore eyes, Giles thought to himself. Buffy and
Willow, freed of the spell that turned them against Xander, where making up
for lost time. They joked with him, watched TV with him, and generally
smothered him with lots of hugs. Xander, for his part, had responded well to
the attention, even cracking a joke or two. But every now and then, Xander
would retreat back into himself. It was a clear sign that he would need more
than a few hours to recover the damage done to him.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it just make you want to vomit." Spike said as he entered the
room.</p>

<p>"One more comment from you Spike and you will have a date with the
dust buster." Buffy shot back. Spike just shrugged. He knew she wouldn't do
it.</p>

<p>"So, someone is out to get you lot." Spike said up beatly. "I like
them already."</p>

<p>"We need to find out who cast that spell." Giles said, removing his
glasses and cleaning them.</p>

<p>"We need to find them and kick their ass." Buffy said with some
vehemence.</p>

<p>"OK, we don't know who or what did this. But do we know why they did
it? Why turn Buffy and Willow against Xander? What purpose does it serve?
What is there to gain?" David pondered. Blank looks from Giles, Willow and
Buffy. A shrug from Xander and a look of amazement from Spike.</p>

<p>"Bloody hell! You lot are stupid. Who ever it was wanted to break up
the Scooby Gang. Without them, Goldie Locks here would be dead in no time.
You want to kill her, separate her from her friends first. Probably would
have later made Red and Goldie Locks have a lovers tiff." Spike said. "I only
wish I had thought of it before I got this bloody chip."</p>

<p>Giles took a moment for the information to sink in. Spike was right.
Someone was out to get Buffy. Then the rest of what Spike said registered.</p>

<p>"A lovers WHAT? Bloody Hell!" Giles exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Buffy and Willow are lovers, welcome to the 21st century, blah,
blah blah. Can we get back to the matter at hand?" David told his father. Out
of the corner of his eye David saw the momentary look that crossed Xander
face when he said that. Not good.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" Willow asked, shocked that Spike was privy to such
personal information.</p>

<p>"It's all over town. Some demon saw you to snogging and now it's the
talk of Sunnydale's demon population." Spike laughed. "You should see the
expression on your face, Red. Priceless." The look that Buffy gave Spike made
him doubt his belief that she wouldn't slay him.</p>

<p>"Look, I don't give a fuck what Buffy and Willow get up to together.
There is a big evil out there with the Scooby Gang in its sights. We need to
find out more information." David said, a little frustrated at the diversion.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a research party in the making." Xander suggested.</p>

<p>"Research party?" David asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yeah. We crack out the books, look up the evil and eat donuts."
Xander smiled, thinking of the good times in the library. David looked at
Xander funny.</p>

<p>"You guys need a life." he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, we should try to research who or what did this. But I'm afraid
that we don't have much to go on." Giles informed the group.</p>

<p>"Start the research, I've got an idea on how to get more info on
this." David looked at his watch. "Shit. I've got a meeting with Huckleberry
Hound in 20 minutes." said David.</p>

<p>"Huckleberry Hound?" asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Riley Finn." David informed her. When she gave him a confused look,
he continued.</p>

<p>"When I read the briefing papers before I came, I saw that the liaison
guy was Riley Finn from Iowa. With the name Finn and coming from Iowa, I
naturally called him Huckleberry Finn. Then when I saw his soldiering
ability, I feel that Huckleberry Hound is more appropriate." Xander had a
good chuckle at that.</p>

<p>"Before you go David." Buffy said, walking over to David. "We owe you
for helping get things normal again."</p>

<p>"No worries. Only glad I could help my friend." dismissed David.</p>

<p>"No. I really owe you and I would like to repay you." Buffy said.
Before anyone could blink, Buffy's knee crashed into David's testicles,
causing him to collapse in a heap. Giles, Spike and Xander all winced in
sympathy pain at the blow. Buffy smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>"Now we are even." she said brightly.</p>

<p>It was 10 minutes before David had recovered enough to leave for his
meeting.</p>
