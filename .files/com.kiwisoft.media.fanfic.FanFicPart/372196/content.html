<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER TWELVE</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">MOMENT OF TRUTH</p>
<p>In her new identity as 'Hannah Montana', Miley finally recorded her demo tape with Mr. Lebeck. Everything went smoothly. In fact, everyone said she sang the song even better than she had at the fair before.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Hollywood Records offered Hannah Montana an official contract with their company and a three record deal. Miley could hardly believe it – all at once, her dreams were coming true.</p>
<p>"I'm so proud of you, bud," Robbie Ray said, hugging his jubilant daughter warmly.</p>
<p>"Thank you, daddy," Miley replied, hugging him back warmly. "I couldn't have done it without you."</p>
<p>"No darlin'… you did it all by yourself," Robbie Ray told his daughter proudly, "You and your angel's voice." Lilly waited until Miley carefully let go of her father, then she practically launched herself into Miley's arms.</p>
<p>"<i>I knew you could do it!</i>" she shouted excitedly, hugging Miley fiercely.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad you're here with me," Miley said in a hushed voice, hugging Lilly back.</p>
<p>"I always will be, Miley… I always will be," Lilly whispered. She broke into a grin. "You think Hannah Montana will mind her best friend tagging along?"</p>
<p>"Hannah wouldn't have it any other way," Miley smiled. "Who knows, maybe we can dress you up too!" Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"We'll see," she responded. "In the meantime, I think we need to celebrate! What do you say Mr. S, can we have a party?" Robbie Ray smiled.</p>
<p>"I think that could be arranged," he answered. "When?" Miley and Lilly looked at each other for a moment.</p>
<p>"How about tomorrow night?" Lilly suggested.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," Miley interrupted. "Lilly, tomorrow's your birthday!" Lilly just shrugged.</p>
<p>"So what?" she said. "I have a birthday every year… but what you've just done is once in a lifetime!" Miley couldn't help grinning a little.</p>
<p>"You're sweet, you know that?" she asked her best friend in the world. "I'm not just gonna let my best friend's birthday go by without doing something… especially when it's her Sweet 16!" Lilly blushed at the love and concern Miley was showing for her.</p>
<p><i>It's gotta be the biggest day of her life… and she's still thinking about me.</i></p>
<p>"Miley…"</p>
<p>"I'm serious, Lils. You've done so much for me… been there for me when I needed you the most… now I want to do this for you. Please, Lilly…"</p>
<p>"I guess it wouldn't do me any good to argue, would it?" Lilly asked softly, smiling despite the tears she felt threatening to spill from her sparkling blue eyes. Miley grinned and shook her head.</p>
<p>"Nope," she said warmly. "So, how about we combine the two into one big party?" She looked back at her father.</p>
<p>"Is that okay daddy?"</p>
<p>"As long as we're not talkin' <i>too</i> big, I'm fine with it, bud," he agreed cheerfully.</p>
<p>"It's settled then!" Miley said happily. She pulled Lilly into another warm hug. "Tomorrow night Lils, we party!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Tomorrow arrived very quickly, and soon the Stewart and Truscott families were busy planning a huge party for Lilly's Sweet 16 and Miley's huge new record contract as Hannah Montana. While Robbie Ray and Heather went shopping for all the food and supplies they would need, Miley, Lilly and Jackson stayed home to decorate the Stewart house for the party.</p>
<p>"I still don't believe you're doing all this for me," Lilly said as she helped Miley hang some purple streamers in the living room. "Well, I mean, I know it's not <i>all</i> for me, but still…"</p>
<p>"You're cute when you babble, you know that Lils?" Miley said with a grin. "You're my best friend and I love you, okay?"</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miles… even when you're being stubborn," Lilly joked. Miley finished taping the last streamer in place and climbed down from the ladder she'd been standing on. She walked over to Lilly and put her arm around her best friend, resting her head on Lilly's shoulder. Instinctively, Lilly returned the embrace and gave Miley a gentle kiss on the top of her head. She felt Miley tighten her embrace and she let her eyes drift closed.</p>
<p>"This is nice," Miley said softly.</p>
<p>"It doesn't, uh… bother you?" Lilly asked her carefully. Feeling Miley in her arms as they shared a tender embrace had been like heaven to Lilly, but she had never expected Miley to feel the same.</p>
<p>"Why would it bother me?" Miley replied lightly. "You give the best hugs of anyone I know, Lils!"</p>
<p>"I do?" Lilly asked sweetly.</p>
<p>"Mmm-hmm," Miley purred. "I could stay like this forever."</p>
<p>"Miley…" Lilly croaked, feeling her heart start to beat faster. Miley never got a chance to answer though. Jackson chose that moment to walk into the room, holding an bunch of balloons by a string, a half-opened package of un-inflated ones in his other hand.</p>
<p>"Miley, Lilly, I could really use your help with… um, am I interrupting something?" Jackson quipped, noticing the embrace Miley and Lilly were sharing.</p>
<p>"No more so than usual," Miley muttered, sharing a secret grin with Lilly as they reluctantly parted. "We'll help you blow up those balloons, Jackson."</p>
<p>"Yeah, no problem," Lilly said softly. Deep inside though, the only thing she <i>really</i> wanted to do was take Miley in her arms and never let go…</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A little while later, the double party began in earnest. Since it had been decided to share Miley's secret with as few people as possible, only a few of her relatives had been invited. Mamaw Ruthie, Aunt Dolly and Aunt Vickie were all there, and each of them congratulated Miley with big hugs and even a few tears.</p>
<p>"I always knew you'd take after your father some day," Mamaw Ruthie said happily. "Your momma would be so proud of you, God rest her soul." Everyone was sitting outside on the back porch, enjoying the cool autumn air while Robbie Ray and Heather finished making dinner.</p>
<p>"You really think so mamaw?" Miley asked her softly.</p>
<p>"I know so, honey," Mamaw said gently. "I imagine she's looking down from Heaven and smiling right now."</p>
<p>"You know, I still remember the first time you tried to sing just like your daddy," Aunt Vicky spoke up. "You were just four years old, and you climbed up on that stage and started singin' right beside him!"</p>
<p>"I remember that too," Aunt Dolly added, grinning. "You were so cute, Miley! You had the whole bar cheering for you!" Miley blushed.</p>
<p>"No fair trying to embarrass me you guys!" she whined.</p>
<p>"Aww, I think it's cute Miley!" Lilly insisted. "I wish I could've seen you up there on stage like that!"</p>
<p>"Well," Mamaw Ruthie said with a grin, "I <i>might</i> still have the old picture I took that night." Miley's eyes widened in alarm.</p>
<p>"Mamaw, no! Not in front of my best friend!" Miley wailed.</p>
<p>"All right, all right," Mamaw said, a twinkle in her eye. "If it really bothers you that much Miley, I'll leave it in my purse."</p>
<p>"Oh come on Miles, it couldn't have been <i>that</i> bad," Lilly teased her.</p>
<p>"You'll never know," Miley quipped.</p>
<p>"If ya'll are through, dinner's ready," Robbie Ray called out. Miley jumped at the opportunity to change the subject.</p>
<p>"Come on, birthday girl, let's get you some dinner!" she said hurriedly. Lilly laughed out loud.</p>
<p>"You, Miley Ray Stewart, are a coward!" she giggled. "Hey, no shoving!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>After dinner, the Stewart and Truscott families retired to the living room to give Lilly her birthday presents. Lilly opened the present from her mom first, and squealed in delight when she saw the beautiful pale blue dress she'd been wanting ever since she first saw it in Knoxville a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>"I don't believe it!" she shouted excitedly. "Thank you, mom!"</p>
<p>"It's not often my daughter asks me for an actual dress to wear," Heather teased her. "How could I say no?"</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," Lilly said carefully, realization dawning on her. "How could you afford this mom? This dress was really expensive!"</p>
<p>"Never you mind," Heather said with a smile. "You wanted it and now it's yours… that's all that matters." Lilly stood and hugged her mother tightly, fighting not to cry.</p>
<p>"I love you mom," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Lilly," Heather said with a smile. "Happy birthday, baby."</p>
<p>"You got some more presents waiting for you over here Lilly," Miley called out, grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>"All right, hold your horses," Lilly said playfully. She walked back over to where Miley was waiting, smiling and holding out another present for her.</p>
<p>"That one's from the three of us," Mamaw Ruthie called out. Aunt Dolly and Aunt Vicky nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>"You didn't have to get me anything Mamaw Stewart!" Lilly exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," Mamaw said, smiling gently. "We're practically family, Lilly… and I will most certainly buy you a present for your birthday if I want to!"</p>
<p>"All right, mamaw," Lilly laughed. "Thank you." She reached into the small gift bag Miley handed her and pulled out something small wrapped in white tissue paper. Carefully pulling the tissue paper away, Lilly revealed a small box… with a brand new iPod Shuffle inside.</p>
<p>"A little bird told us you've been wanting one of those too," Aunt Dolly said with a grin.</p>
<p>"You guys!" Lilly exclaimed. "You didn't have to do this!"</p>
<p>"Yes we did," Mamaw Ruthie quipped. "Now you just take it and enjoy it, and I don't wanna hear another word about it young lady." Ruthie's stern words were contradicted by her knowing smile. Realizing any further argument was going to do her no good, Lilly just smiled and got up to hug each of three women, thanking them again for their thoughtful gift. When she sat back down again, Miley leaned over and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>"You'll get my present later, okay?" she promised. Lilly arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Why later?" she asked quietly.</p>
<p>"It's a surprise, silly," Miley replied, a mischievous twinkle in her eye. She jumped up.</p>
<p>"Right now, it's cake time!" she exclaimed. She hurried into the kitchen with Lilly's mother and returned a few moments later carrying a big pink frosted birthday cake with sixteen flickering candles on top of it. Miley set the cake down carefully on the coffee table in the center of the living room.</p>
<p>"Okay everyone, start singin'!" Miley called out happily. Everyone then joined in to sing 'Happy Birthday' for Lilly. Beaming happily, she Lilly waited until the song was done and then blew out her candles.</p>
<p>"Don't forget to make a wish!" Heather reminded her daughter. Looking at Miley from out of the corner of her eye, Lilly blushed slightly.</p>
<p>"I already did," she whispered.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Later, after the party was over and everyone had left, Miley told Lilly to go upstairs and get ready for bed, promising she'd be right up with her present. Lilly did as she was asked, then waited patiently for Miley to return, wondering what kind of surprise her best friend could possibly be planning for her.</p>
<p>Long minutes ticked by and still there no sign of Miley. Then Lilly noticed a small piece of paper lying on the bed beside her. Curious, she picked it up, and discovered it was a note from Miley:</p>
<p><i>Lilly,</i></p>
<p><i>Meet me outside at the barn!</i></p>
<p><i>Miley</i></p>
<p>"What in the world?" Lilly wondered aloud. Shaking her head and smiling, Lilly put on her shoes and made her way outside. She found Miley waiting for her just inside the barn, holding onto the reins of a horse Lilly couldn't remember seeing at the Stewart's before, a beautiful black mare.</p>
<p>"Miley, what's going on?" Lilly asked, not understanding what was going on. Miley smiled shyly.</p>
<p>"Happy Birthday, Lils… say hello to your birthday present," she said softly. Lilly's eyes widened.</p>
<p>"W-what?" she stammered.</p>
<p>"She's yours, Lilly," Miley explained patiently. "As much as you've come to enjoy riding, I thought you'd really appreciate her. She can stay here of course, and you can come visit here and ride her anytime. Her name's Sadie, but you can change her name if you want." Lilly's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"Are you… are you serious?" she whispered. Miley smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"Lilly, you mean more to me than I can say. You've been the best friend anyone could ever ask for… you've always been there when I needed you, you supported me through this crazy dream that looks like it's about to come true… and you've never once asked for anything. I love you so much, Lilly… and I always will." Miley's heartfelt confession struck Lilly almost speechless.</p>
<p>"Miley, I…" she stammered, struggling to speak. All the emotions welling up inside Lilly made words almost impossible though; actions were the only things she had left. She lunged forward and wrapped her arms around Miley in a fierce hug, tears stinging her eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Miley," she managed, her voice tight. "I love you too… so much…"</p>
<p>"Not as much as I love you, Silly," Miley whispered back, holding Lilly tightly.</p>
<p>"You haven't called me <i>that</i> in a while," Lilly laughed a little.</p>
<p>"Old habits die hard," Miley teased. Unconsciously, she began to run her hands gently up and down Lilly's back. Lilly leaned into the embrace, enjoying the pleasant sensations. Her own hands found Miley's long brunette hair and she began gently running her fingers through it.</p>
<p>"Miley?" Lilly said softly. She raised her head to look up into Miley's eyes, sparkling in the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Lils?" Miley answered. Whatever Lilly might've been about to say fled her mind in an instant at the sound of Miley's sweet, soft voice. The silvery moonlight shining behind her made her look more beautiful than Lilly could ever remember seeing her… like a heavenly angel. Lilly's heart started beating faster, swelling with what she knew was love.</p>
<p>All the old familiar feelings she'd been trying to deny for the past three years washed over her, and Lilly did the last thing she ever imagined she'd do: she leaned forward and captured Miley's lips in a gentle kiss. Even more surprising, she felt Miley begin kissing her back…</p>
