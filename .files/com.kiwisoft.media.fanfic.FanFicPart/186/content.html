<!-- Girls Movie Night \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>Buffy adjusted her position on the couch slightly.
Wiggling her toes out from underneath the blanket she
had wrapped mummy like around her body. </p>

<p>It was the first of the girls-only Friday night
movie-athons. Buffy, Willow, Tara and Anya had
gathered together at the Summers’ home about an hour
ago and were in various stages of settling down for
the evening. Earlier in the day, before leaving on a
three-day trip to San Francisco, Joyce had been rather
adamant that Dawn also be included in the night’s
festivities, to which both siblings had immediately
objected. It took several hours of cajoling their
mother for her to finally relent and agree that Dawn
could spend one night, and one night only, at her
friend Melinda’s house. </p>

<p>Buffy had sighed in relief as they both helped their
mother finish packing. She was very much in need of
some time away from her constantly annoying kid
sister. Dawn, on the other hand, was equally as happy
that her mother had consented. Although, she loved
hanging out with Willow and Tara and talking about
witchstuff, unknown to either Buffy or Joyce,
Melinda’s older brother Todd was home from college for
a few days and Dawn had a little crush on him. So the
witch talk would have to wait for another night. </p>

<p>So the girls had packed their mother's stuff up and
practically pushed her out the door to the car. A few
hours later, Dawn was over at Melinda’s, and the
xx-chromosomed members of the Scooby gang where
settling down in the living room for their all-night
movie-athon. </p>

<p>"Where is she?" Anya said annoyed as she lay on her
stomach in the sleeping bag on the floor. She twisted
around to growl in Buffy's direction. "I want
popcorn!"</p>

<p>Buffy rolled her eyes, tossed off her blanket and got
up from the couch. She had sent Willow in to help Tara
get the popcorn when the blonde had stumbled back into
the living room 10 minutes ago, slightly embarrassed
by the fact that she didn't know where the popcorn
was. Like she should have known, even though she'd
never actually been in the Summers' kitchen before.
Buffy had poked Willow with her foot to go help, and
had settled back into the comfy couch. Obviously it
had been a bad decision to send Willow in to help
Tara.</p>

<p>So she dragged herself up off of the couch and headed
towards the kitchen. When she reached the doorframe,
she stopped abruptly. Looking back into the living
room, and then into the kitchen again, she thought
maybe it would be a good idea to quietly back away… </p>

<p>"Willow."</p>

<p>The sultry voice nailed Buffy to the floor. 'Umm,
maybe I'll just watch and make sure they find
everything okay.' She said trying to convince herself
that she was only going to watch the two witches for
purely selfless reasons. After all, someone had to
make sure they knew where the popcorn was kept. </p>

<p>Of course, the real reason she wanted to stay and
watch the two was more than her swirling mind wanted
to consider at the moment. Settling herself against
the right side of the doorframe and a little behind,
Buffy positioned herself so she had an unobstructed
view of the entire kitchen. </p>

<p>Tara was in the corner of the room, near the
microwave, bent over slightly as she leant against the
counter. Her arms rested against the cool titled
surface as she watched the microwave timer ticking
down, nuking the kernels inside. Willow, who had
reached up into a high cabinet next to Tara to grab
another box of popcorn, teetered momentarily before
placing a hand on the blonde’s back to steady herself.
Once she had retrieved the box, she set it down on the
counter, her hand remaining on Tara’s back. Buffy
watched as the redhead eased her hand downward in the
direction of a small bit of exposed flesh just above
her girlfriend’s skirt. Gently slipping her fingers
underneath. </p>

<p>"Willow!" Tara warned as she stood up knocking
Willow's hand away from her body. </p>

<p>"What?" Willow smiled innocently at her girlfriend, a
silly grin on her face.</p>

<p>Buffy had to clasp a hand over her mouth for fear her
laughing would interrupt the scene. Sometimes Willow
was just too cute.</p>

<p>"W-w-we need to finish the popcorn." Tara said as she
pointed to the microwave.</p>

<p>"We are. I mean it's not like we can put some witchy
spell on it to make it cook any faster now can we?"
Willow's broad smile curled into another grin Buffy
had never seen before, and the blonde slayer watched
as Tara gulped in trepidation.</p>

<p>"Willow." Tara's soft deep voice was nearly lost to
the slayer, but Buffy managed to hear enough of the
blonde's tone to know that she was both afraid, and
aroused. </p>

<p>It didn't take long for Buffy to figure out why. In a
flash Willow twirled the blonde wiccan back around
facing the microwave. She pushed her body against
Tara's back. When Tara tried to protest by pushing her
away, Willow grabbed Tara's hands and placed them
firmly on the counter top, palms flat. </p>

<p>"Stay." She said commandingly. </p>

<p>
It was Buffy's turn to gulp. This was so wrong. She
should turn right around and head back into the living
room. She was watching something that was meant to be
between ‘those’ two... not shared. But she couldn't
move. She had to admit, she was intrigued by the two
wiccans. </p>

<p>When Willow had announced that she and Tara where more
than just 'Wicca buddies’, it had taken some time for
Buffy to really get use to that fact. And she had…
gotten use to it, mostly because she absolutely adored
Willow. The slightly neurotic babbling redhead was as
dear to her as her own little sister. </p>

<p>Plus, Tara was the kind of person it was almost
impossible to dislike. Her shyness and vulnerability
made you want to hold her and protect her forever, but
her knowledge and willingness to help when the scary
stuff got 'real' scary, even though you could tell she
was petrified most of the time, made one admire her. </p>

<p>So Buffy had gotten used to Willow and Tara as a
couple... and Tara as a friend. So when she started to
move beyond the initial shock, she started thinking
about... well... Willow AND Tara. And what exactly
Willow AND Tara did together… as a couple. She often
found herself, patrolling late at night – alone -
letting her mind wander to places she knew a best
friend shouldn’t let their mind wander to.</p>

<p>All Buffy knew was that Willow looked happier than she
had ever seen her, and Tara stuttered a LOT less these
days.</p>

<p>So right here, right now, watching the two of them,
well Buffy just couldn't help herself.</p>

<p>"Where's..."</p>

<p>Buffy quickly clamped a hand over Anya's annoying
mouth. A quick glance back into the kitchen told her
that neither of the girl’s had heard Anya approach.</p>

<p>"Shhh." Was all Buffy said and pointed into the
kitchen. </p>

<p>As if in total understanding, Anya simply nodded.
Buffy resumed her place on the right side of the
doorframe, while Anya took up residence on the left
side. They both turned their eyes back towards the
kitchen… to Willow and Tara.</p>

<p>Tara had moved her hand again and Willow placed her
own over the blonde's. Running her fingers over the
smooth top she whispered into Tara's ear, "Stay."</p>

<p>Tara shivered, thought about putting a stop to this,
and decided she just didn't have the willpower. It was
so hard for her to deny Willow anything. Laying her
hand on the counter, she simply nodded. Buffy could
see that Tara's compliance seemed to change Willow's
demeanor. The redhead's smile disappeared and was
replaced by a more serious look. Taking a small step
back, Willow thought for a moment, and than gently
eased Tara's legs open a little further. She than
pulled Tara's hips back a little so that the taller
girl was leaning over the counter slightly. </p>

<p>Willow's breathing increased as she licked her dry
lips. Rubbing her hands together to warm them, she
took a step forward into Tara's open legs. Locking her
feet on the inside of Tara's ankles, she pushed the
blonde's legs open a little further and than leaned
into her body. "Love you." She whispered into Tara’s
ear.</p>

<p>Both Buffy and Anya physically leaned forward into the
kitchen to listen to the words Willow caressed into
Tara's ear. Buffy quickly glanced at Anya as if to ask
'maybe we should leave?' But when Anya simply
continued to stare at the two wiccans, the last bit of
conscious Buffy had slide away and she turned her eyes
back to the scene.</p>

<p>Willow slowly ran her right hand up Tara's bare arm,
gently over her shoulder and even more tortuously slow
down the blondes' back. Once again reaching that small
bit of exposed flesh right above Tara's skirt, she let
her fingers slip softly underneath. The soft moan that
escaped the blonde’s lips nearly caused Buffy’s knees
to give way. 'Wow.' Was all she could think, because
her mind, not to mention her body, just seemed to
start pulsating when she heard Tara's voice. </p>

<p>Willow slowly began to lift up Tara's shirt. Her
fingers lightly dragging upward as more and more pale
flesh was uncovered. Willow stopped only when she was
satisfied enough of Tara’s back was exposed to her.
She then held the shirt up and bent down, her lips
began to caress along the same path her fingers had
traveled. </p>

<p>Tara dipped her head forward, her hair fanning out
along the counter. Closing her eyes tightly. She
allowed her body to enjoy the touches her lover, her
life, her Willow where enflaming her with. A slow line
of heated kisses were placed up the side of her back,
and when she felt that heat reach the edge of her bra,
Tara grabbed desperately for something more stable to
steady herself against. </p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The voice warned, and Tara replaced her hand on the
counter, hoping her legs wouldn’t give out and she
wouldn’t crash, forehead first, onto the hard tiled
surface. Willow really could be quite sadistic at
times... in a mini-sadistic kind of way.</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't believe three things; first, that she
was actually STILL watching this; second, that Willow
was quite the little control freak, and third; that
the sight of Tara's exposed back was making her quite
hot. And not in the ‘turn-on-the-air-conditioner’ kind
of way. She dared not even glance over at Anya. She
knew if she did, she'd probably feel very, very
embarrassed. </p>

<p>Or more realistically, if she had looked over at Anya,
the ex-demon would most likely have sanctioned her
voyeuristic adventure. Not too mention that looking
away might cause her to missing what was happening
before her eyes.</p>

<p>After she had scolded her girlfriend for moving her
hand, Willow allowed her lips to go back to sucking on
Tara's back, just below her bra. Deciding she wanted
freer access to Tara's body, she swiftly grabbed the
edge of Tara’s shirt and pulled it roughly over her
head. Discarding it disdainfully on the floor. </p>

<p>Tara quickly repositioned her hands on the counter. </p>

<p>It was strange, even though Tara sometimes got a
little scared when Willow would play these little
games with her, in a way, it completely turned her on.
And right now, she was very turned on. She could feel
the heat pulsating in regions of her body slightly
southward. Tara wasn't sure if it was the fact that
either Buffy or Anya could walk in at any moment, or
that, even though Willow was completely in charge, she
knew that whatever she did, would do, would be to
please Tara. She had never had that before... someone
who loved her so much with every ounce of their being,
that they would concentrate on nothing more than
making her happy. Making her feel loved. Making her
feel the way she did right now, aroused.</p>

<p>All conscious thought was abruptly ended when Tara
felt Willow's hands wrap around her body, skid across
her ribs, and arch upward hungrily filing themselves
with her breasts. </p>

<p>"Goddess." Was all the coherent language that slipped
from Tara’s lips as she gave totally into her bodies
wants and needs. She pushed herself forward into
Willow’s hands as the redhead squeezed and played with
her. </p>

<p>Buffy wrapped her hand around the wooden molding of
the doorframe and began to dig her nails in. This was
a little more than she had bargained for. She'd never
really thought of Willow... and well Tara for that
matter, as these, well… as these sexual beings. Ones
with, from what she could see, quite a hungry appetite
for one another. And it was all just so damn erotic.
She continued to be riveted by the scene.</p>

<p>Willow began to rake her fingernails over the already
stiffened nipples of her beloved through the silky
white bra. At the same time, she attached her lips to
the back of Tara's neck and slowly began licking,
nipping and kissing from just below her ear, to the
edge of the blondes shoulder. Up and down again, she
continued the sweet torture of Tara's nipples. </p>

<p>She never seemed to get enough of Tara. Touching her,
kissing her. Touching Tara was all she ever dreamed of
these days. When they were with the Scooby's, or
others, she'd have to satiate her needs with a small
touch on the elbow, or a quick squeeze of Tara's hand;
but when they were alone, Willow wanted to touch
ever-tiny bit of Tara's flesh. Inside, out, up and
down. And she took every free moment that they were
alone, like now, to indulge in her favorite pastime...
Tara. </p>

<p>Allowing her left hand to remain fondling Tara's
nipple, her lips followed her right hand as she bent
down groping for the edge of Tara's skirt. Willow
kissed the small of Tara's back as she began to ease
her hand underneath the long flowing garment. She felt
Tara beginning to shiver uncontrollably underneath her
as she dragged her hand upward. Nails scratching
lightly on the outside of the silkiest thigh Willow
had ever felt. </p>

<p>As Willow lifted Tara's skirt up higher and higher,
more of the blonde's pale leg was exposed to Buffy's
view. Her eyes widened in worried realization at just
how far Willow might take this. Did she really want to
see her best friend making love to her girlfriend?
Because, at the rate Willow was going, that's just
what might be happening at any moment.</p>

<p>Sensing that Buffy was starting to waver, Anya quickly
looked over at the slayer. Cringing her face in
warning, she shook her head no as if to say 'you
better not stop them.' Not waiting for Buffy's
response, the ex-demon turned her attention back to
the two witches. </p>

<p>Oh she was so enjoying the show. When first Tara, than
Willow and finally Buffy had disappeared without
getting her any popcorn, Anya had huffed out of her
sleeping bag and angrily made her way to the kitchen.
She instantly knew something was up when she saw Buffy
peering around the corner like a kid watching
something they weren’t meant to see. She had spoken up
only to be brutally, something she was most definitely
going to tell Xander about tomorrow, quieted by the
blonde. Buffy had motioned inside the kitchen, and
once Anya had gotten her own glimpse of what was going
on, she was all too willing to settle in for the ride.
She had seen quite a lot in her
'too-many-years-too-mention' lifespan, and one of her
favorite hobbies, one that had stayed with her through
the years, was watching other people have sex. It was
a pastime she had introduced Xander to, and she was
most definitely not going to miss the opportunity to
watch two live people have a little romp. Especially,
since these days all she got to quench that particular
amusement was when she sent her boyfriend out to rent
porn videos. Plus, the two witches were quite fun to
watch!</p>

<p>Willow's hand stopped when it reached Tara's hip.
Although much of the skirt still hung down around the
shy girl’s legs, the entire side of one leg was
completely exposed to the chilly night air. Willow
wrapped the end of the skirt into the waist band
holding it up, pushing Tara's leg open further, she
draped her hand on her girlfriends thigh and slowly
began to caress her way towards the front. </p>

<p>Not able to stand the heat that was pulsating through
her veins any longer, Tara stood up and dropped her
head back onto Willow's shoulder. Willow took the
offered exposed neck and began to suck ruthlessly on
the pulsating flesh. Tara wrapped her hand into the
redhead’s short trestles and held her firmly against
her body. While Willow's left hand continued to
indulge in the feel of Tara's nipple, her right hand
worked its way forward and upward. Propping her foot
up on a slightly open draw near the floor, Willow
lifted up Tara's leg placing it over her knee, the
blondes' foot dangled against Willow's calf. Willow
now had all the access she desired and she did not
hesitate, her hand moving swiftly to Tara's center.</p>

<p>Both Buffy and Anya's breathing increased... loudly.
On either side of the doorframe they were both leaning
into the kitchen as far as they could and still remain
hidden. A very hard task indeed as Anya soon
discovered. Tripping slightly in her eagerness, she
stumbled slightly forward into the kitchen. Standing
frozen, she waited to be yelled at. When neither of
the witches turned around, she turned and grinned
towards Buffy and simply stood where she was. It would
serve them right if they turned around and saw both
her and Buffy watching them. After all, they had
forgotten about her popcorn.</p>

<p>Tara roughly pulled Willow's lips away from her neck
and towards her mouth. Devouring the redhead the
instant she felt Willow's fingers touching her
panties. The moan that escaped her lips sent a
dizzying sound that seemed to fill the entire space.
Pulling Willow away from her so she could look into
her green eyes, Tara said one simple word...</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>It was more than Willow could bare and she quickly
worked her fingers past the waste band of Tara's
panties.</p>

<p>BING!</p>

<p>The sudden sound of the microwave as it finished
nuking the popcorn scared all of them and Buffy
squealed. Buffy squealing brought the attention of
Willow and Tara towards her, than Tara screamed... </p>

<p>"Oh my god!"</p>

<p>Pushing Willow away from her, she grabbed her shirt
from the floor and rushed passed the other two women,
making a mad dash up the stairs to the second floor
bathroom. </p>

<p>Buffy just stood there utterly embarrassed and ashamed
of herself for watching. Willow leaned against the
counter with a look on her face half way between
mortified, and smug, and Anya.... she just pushed her
way past Willow and grabbed her popcorn.</p>

<p>"You were taking too long" She said nonchalantly and
headed back into the living room leaving the two
friends standing their shocked.</p>
