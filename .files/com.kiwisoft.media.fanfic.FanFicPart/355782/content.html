<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Twelve -->

<p>Late the next morning after breakfast while Lacy cleaned the kitchen, Dani helped Gage fix the heater problem.</p>
		<p>"We going to the cave today?" Dani asked hopefully, doing everything she could to get on the writer's good side.</p>
		<p>"Yeah. Thought we'd go out on the lake and check it out again." Gage answered, cognizant of Lacy's reluctance to allow her daughter to explore it.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The idea didn't suit Dani entirely, but driving the boat again appealed to her so she figured she'd let Gage off the hook again.
			<i>But I will get to the bottom of this and explore that cave.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Twisting a new fuse in the electrical box, Gage declared. "There. That should do it."</p>
		<p>"It's fixed now, huh?" Dani asked.</p>
		<p>"Should be. This place is heated by electric and the fuse was bad."</p>
		<p>"That means tonight the bedroom will have heat." Dani stated, lost in her own thoughts. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dani's words raised their ugly head, reminding Gage of the fact that fixing the heater gave them one less excuse to share the same bed again.
			<i>Great. That was smart. Well, at least I can use the excuse of finishing my story.</i>
		</p>

		<p>With the boat anchored just outside the cave's water entranceway, Gage and the kids swam around exploring it as Lacy soaked up the sun. The weather turned quite warm by mid-afternoon and they were making the best of it.</p>
		<p>Holding Derek next to her, Gage yelled at Dani. "Don't go in too far."</p>
		<p>Dani's voice echoed back from under the cave's ceiling then heard the expected response. "I won't."</p>
		<p>Gage wasn't too worried the cave's recess extended only about fifteen feet. That thought caused her to consider that the only person she ever had to be responsible for her whole life was herself. Now, watching the kids as they swam around in the water shed new light on what a huge responsibility laid on the shoulders of parents. It was quite an undertaking. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Green eyes darted back and forth between the two children. Both in their own ways were adventurous. Derek enjoyed floating in his lifejacket, mercilessly splashing Gage as Dani edged her way further in the cave.</p>
		<p>Several hours later, waterlogged and pruned, Gage persuaded both kids to climb back into the boat. Dani wrapped a beach towel around her and parked herself in the captain's chair while Derek decided his mother needed company and attempted to climb on her.</p>
		<p>"Ohhh..." Lacy yelped as her son touched her sunburned back. Her sudden reaction caused Derek to whimper and retreat toward Gage who was pulling up the anchor.</p>
		<p>Lacy hurried to wrap her arms around Derek. "I'm sorry, honey."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A few tears wet his face. "Sorry."</p>
		<p>"It's okay." She kissed him lightly. "You just startled me." Looking at Gage, Lacy added. "Guess I over did it."</p>
		<p>"Here." Gage offered her a soft towel to cover her sunburned shoulders. "We'll head back and put something on that." Turning to Dani, she asked. "You ready, Captain."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>While Derek took a nap and Lacy struggled with a cold shower pelting her super sensitive skin, trying to wash off the apparently ineffectual sun tanning lotion, Dani practiced some of her rope tying skills.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy stiffly walked into the living room after her shower wearing a white v-neck tee shirt and a pair of cotton shorts. She eased herself down on the couch and squirted some lotion in her hand. Delicately applying it to her arms and upper legs, she tensed at the contact. "I should have known better."</p>
		<p>Concerned for her mother and her own plans, Dani asked. "You'll be better by the weekend, right?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I think so. Why?"</p>
		<p>"The fair's this weekend. Jeez, mom, you promised."</p>
		<p>Struggling to apply the lotion to her back, Lacy absent-mindedly agreed. "Hmmm."</p>
		<p>From the kitchen, Gage watched Lacy smooth the lotion over her long arms and legs. Dropping the unpeeled potato on the counter, Gage dashed over to where Lacy was in need of some assistance. "Here let me." Gage procured the lotion from her. "Go ahead lay on your stomach."</p>
		<p>Lacy lifted up and turned over, lying down. Gage hesitantly lifted the white tee shirt up to the top of the star's shoulders.
			<i>My God, she is beautiful. </i>The soft, supple and sexy skin screamed to her and Gage didn't resist the temptation.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy basked in the soothing feel of pliant hands gliding over her sensitive skin. She allowed her mind to drift in the pleasure she was experiencing until the insistent sound of her daughter's voice brought her abruptly back.</p>
		<p>"We are going to the fair, right?" Dani demanded an answer.</p>
		<p>Noting the tension sear through Lacy's back muscles at the question, Gage interceded. "Absolutely." Poignantly looking at the young girl. "That's a promise."</p>
		<p>After securing the guarantee and having no interest in watching her mother and Gage, Dani returned to her knot tying.</p>
		<p>Gage immediately felt the muscles under her hands relax so she lavishly continued her gentle, soothing massage. For long moments, both enjoyed the healing touch that passed between them. Stretching the enjoyable session out for as long as she could, Gage reluctantly pulled her hands away from the soft skin of the beautiful woman. "I'm done."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Readied for bed, Gage herded both kids to her bedroom and piled them up on it. "I'll be right back." She met Lacy in the hallway just outside the door.</p>
		<p>"You sure you don't mind." Lacy asked.</p>
		<p>"No, not at all. Besides, I've got to finish the story or I may not live another day." Looking the beautiful woman up and down, Gage asked. "What about you? You gonna be okay?"</p>
		<p>"I'll be fine. I guess it's really best if I sleep alone with this sunburn and all." Lacy said. "Though I hate to miss the end of the story."</p>
		<p>Gage laughed. "Well, I'll make it up to you later. Give you your own personal story time." With that pledge, both Lacy and Gage returned to their respective bedrooms.
			<i>My God, I am flirting dangerously close to the edge.</i>

		<p>"With Quint hovering close behind, Geoff entered the cave with only a small torch and sword strapped to his side. Silently, they explored every entryway leading deeper inside the dark corridors. Geoff could sense Mecca's closeness, sending her reassurance that he was coming for her. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Mecca waited patiently for two days hoping for someone to rescue her. Feeling desolate, the evil Robida didn't help matters by taunting her, describing in detail how she was going to rot in the dungeon because her future husband wouldn't come and save her. So Mecca determined to save herself.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Just then, Quint and Geoff peeked their heads around the cave's wall, having infiltrated the interior dungeon. Watching from a distance, Geoff tried to get Mecca's attention, pitching small pebbles near her, as the evil Robida swiped a sharp blade along her delicate neck. The evil Robida noticed the flicker of her blue eyes and turned to see Geoff step out from behind a cave wall with Quint buzzing in the air behind him.</p>
		<p>"Drawing a sword, Geoff approached Robida ready for battle. While the evil Robida had diverted his attention from Mecca, she quickly scrapped the sharp rock she found on the ground against the rope tied around her hands. </p>
		<p>"Quint warned Geoff that some of Robida's henchmen were approaching from behind. Having to turn his attention to them, he had provided Mecca with the time needed to free herself. Untying the rope around her ankles, she formulated an idea as the evil Robida returned his attention to her.</p>
		<p>"Quint and Geoff were engaged in an all out battle with the twenty henchmen. As Robida descended on Mecca, she pretended to be restrained by the ropes until he edged closer and closer....."</p>
		<p>Lacy stepped inside and quietly announced. "I can't sleep."</p>
		<p>"Come on, mom. We're just getting to the good part." Looking at the storyteller for assurance. "Right?"</p>
		<p>Lacy slipped into bed next to Gage who only nodded in agreement. "Don't let me stop you. Go on." Encouraging Gage to continue.</p>
		<p>"Just as the evil Robida was about to slice Mecca's neck she leaned back, kicking him right in the....." Gage corrected herself. "Face. Stunned, he fell back temporarily losing his balance. Scooping some dirt in her hand she quickly got up. As he was about to strike again, Mecca blew the handful of dirt in his face. In his confused state, Mecca took the opportunity that presented itself.</p>
		<p>"Just as Quint and Geoff finished off the last of the henchmen they turned around ready to help free Mecca only to find she had bound the evil Robida securely with the rope that had previously held her feet. Geoff rushed to his love, wrapping her in his arms.</p>
		<p>"The next day, the celebration continued throughout the land with the formal announcement of their marriage and all were relieved to hear that the evil Robida was transported in a capsule far away into the future."</p>
		<p>Sensing the ending of the story, Dani concluded. "And they lived happily ever after." A short pause. "I knew she'd get out of it on her own."</p>
		<p>"So you liked it, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, yes, I did. Very good story there, Gage. Perhaps I'll let you tell me another." Dani yawned, closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p>
		<p>Smiling at Lacy, Gage said. "That's the highest praise I've ever gotten for one of my stories."</p>
		<p>"Me too. Jage, I like story, too." Derek supplied his input.</p>
		<p>Gage brushed her lips in a light kiss across his forehead as Lacy watched the sweet scene unfold. Derek laid his head down on her chest, closed his eyes and fell to sleep. </p>
		<p>"That was nice." Lacy stated simply. She snuggled closer as near as her sun burnt body would allow and still be comfortable, shut her eyes and fell asleep.</p>
