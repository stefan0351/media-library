<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 1 -->

<p>For the past week now, the crew of Voyager has been very busy repairing the
ship yet again. Apparently, the section of space Voyager just past through was
suppose to be uninhabited according to Seven's data from the collective. Grid
2983 'was' supposed to be a barren star system in which Voyager 'was' suppose
to calmly and quietly sail through. Instead Voyager flew through a war zone,
literally. Seven failed to mention that her data was over 200 years old. The
Captain failed to ask how old the data was. Chakotay failed to act as devil's
advocate and question the data. Tuvok failed to have the ship at peak tactile
readiness to prevent things like this from happening. And the list goes on and
on. Everyone on the command staff (and even some crew members) felt they shared
some of the blame for endangering the ship, if not all the blame. But this
feeling of overwhelming guilt was something new for Seven. Even though she knew
it was illogical, Seven couldn't help but feel that if she had run current
senor sweeps instead of relying on ancient data than the ship, her collective,
would not have been harmed. (Never mind the fact that Harry had run senor
sweeps himself but could not detect the ships until they were almost on top of
them.) Janeway tried to convince Seven that it was not her fault for not
knowing about the neighboring species at war fighting over territory.
Technically the space was still barren but that fact made Seven feel not at all
better. And for her newly emerging humanity, Seven had a few choice words for.</p>

<p>Of course, one good thing did come out of all
this feeling guilty. Everyone was more than willing to work extra long hours
and work extra hard to get the ship, ship shape. No one was more appreciative
of this than B'Elanna was, who had the hardest job aboard ship, fixing it. But
the chief of engineer's job was lightened ever so slightly with the help of a
starship Captain, her first officer, and an ex-borg.</p>

<p>B'Elanna finally had to admit that she was
grateful for having Seven around, although this would never be said aloud it
was a start. Seven and B'Elanna had worked very closely for about a week now
and for some reason they were actually being civil to each other. Of course there
were times when Seven would go off on her own tangent and B'Elanna would scream
but old habits were hard to break. What was really odd was that the suppose to
be mortal enemies were seen spending time with each other outside of
engineering during their forced breaks. At first they would spend time with
each other talking about the repairs but then at some point it became personal.
They would talk about things that went on during the week, or about Icheb, or
new modifications to be made and such. B'Elanna learned a lot about Seven
during those talks and found out, quite abruptly, that Seven no longer held the
title of ice queen. In fact, Torres realized that under that cool borg
exterior, Seven felt responsible for the damage done to the ship for some reason.
The Lt. now felt quite guilty herself for the way she has treated Seven in the
past. No matter how hard Seven tries to deny it or how hard she tries to hide
it, Seven cares and feels just like any other human does. Although B'Elanna
couldn't change the past, she was determined to change the future.</p>

<p>Lanna had already made too many mistakes by
not admitting she was wrong. The most recent being the Tom Paris marriage
thing. She knew she had doubts before the marriage but she was determined to
make it work, especially since it seemed Tom was also so very determined. Only
problem was, she didn't love him any more. There was no more chemistry or
sparks to speak of so what else was left. They had never had anything in common
to fall back on so there was nothing keeping B'Elanna in a loveless marriage.
She finally broke things off three months ago and has been single ever since.
And since there was no marriage ceremony to make things official, it was easy
for her to null the marriage agreement. And now instead of spending time with
Tom or Harry, here she was spending it going over ways to dismantle the extra
borg alcoves no longer being used by the children. What a difference a week
makes.</p>

<p>Seven and B'Elanna had just come back from
cargo bay two, finished with the repairs needed there. So far all the major
repairs were completed and now only minor ones remained, such as the holodeck
controls and a few insignificant gelpacks in that same vicinity which could be
taken care of at the Chief's discretion. B'Elanna went over to one of the
engineering panels and began to input data as Seven came to stand next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;So Seven, since we've finished with your alcove, what do you say we
hit the holodeck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That IS one of the last items which need to be repaired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take that as a yes.&quot; B'Elanna smiled as she looked up from
her work. &quot;Neelix asked me if we could finish up the repairs to the
holodeck in time for the Christmas party. And since work is light I thought we
could work on it today so that it'll be up and running in two days time leaving
Neelix with three days to program it. Looks like we get our party after
all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; A dejected sounding Ensign asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Ensign Riley, you do not sound pleased that the holodeck will be
repaired in time.&quot; Seven stated showing off her observational brilliance.</p>

<p>Ensign Riley walked over toward her two superiors, who also happened to be
friends with Neelix and asked herself again why she had to open her big mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, what's the matter, don't you feel like celebrating Christmas
this year?&quot; Lanna asked all the none too gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's just that...&quot; Riley took a look around. &quot;Don't
tell Neelix this, but everyone is pretty much tired with the same party year
after year. We all want to do something new and decided to have our own little
parties. With the holodeck off-line we wouldn't feel so guilty for skipping his
party but since you're going to fix it we'll all have to come up with excuses
now.&quot; Riley concluded feeling like she had just been interrogated.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed. Perhaps I may have a solution to this situation but you must
refrain from making excuses prematurely.&quot; Seven said in her usual cryptic
manner.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, you won't tell Neelix, will you?&quot; Riley asked wondering
which airlock was the best to jump out of.</p>

<p>&quot;No. I will not. I 'have an idea'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks Seven. I think I'll go back to work now.</p>

<p>Ensign Riley walked off before she could stick her big foot deeper into an
even bigger mouth. Which left a contemplating Seven of Nine and an intrigued
B'Elanna Torres.</p>

<p>&quot;So, are you ready to go to the holodeck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna and Seven walked out of engineering after gathering the tools
needed for the job. It was a very silent walk considering B'Elanna was waiting
for Seven to tell her what she was planning on doing and Seven was waiting for
B'Elanna to ask. B'Elanna cursed borg patience.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay Seven, you win. Now tell me what the hell it is you are planning
in that borg head of your's.&quot; Torres glared at Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No?! What do you mean no?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are one of the 'biggest gossips' aboard Voyager and I do not want
my surprise ruined.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're surprise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my surprise, to the crew. Perhaps as a 'Christmas gift'.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that Seven left a stunned Klingon standing behind. 'A gift to the
crew? But why?' The chief engineer contemplated as she tried to catch up to the
ex-drone.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the ship, repairing
the holodeck was not as easy as first thought. Problem after problem would just
pop up out of thin air and it took B'Elanna and Seven an entire day to figure
out that there was another cause for these problems. It seemed that the damaged
gelpacks near by were interfering with the holodeck controls. So repairs were
stopped on the holodeck in order to first repair the gelpacks. While others
worked on the gelpacks, Seven spent some of her time going over her plan with
Neelix. Once she had convinced him to leave the holodeck programming to her she
started right away on the parameters for the program. Seven wanted to create a
program that held a part of everyone's Christmas memories in it and had decided
to create a 'Christmas town' for the crew to 'play' in. Unfortunately, the
holodeck controls were being most unco-operative.</p>
