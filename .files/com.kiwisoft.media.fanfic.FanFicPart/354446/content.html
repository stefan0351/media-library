<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 6: New Powers and new Problems -->

<p>This night Willow accompanied Buffy during her sweep through the graveyards
of Sunnydale. She neither wanted to be alone in the dorm nor leave her Slayer do
this alone. ‘Her Slayer’. How that sounded. It was in some way strange to think
of Buffy that way. But she liked it. Although if she had been asked six months
ago if she was -as she still liked to formulate it- ‘kinda gay’ then the first
and only thing she would have answered had been ‘No way’. But so much had
changed since then. She had fallen for her best friend. And Oz... It was strange
to think about him now; now that he had left.</p>
<p>*** "It is safer for you if I leave. I have to find out how to reverse this
and I can’t do this here where I have to be worried about you." ***</p>
<p>It really wasn’t nice of him to just leave. But she could understand him
now. He probably had noticed that she had changed after he returned from that
gig in Chicago. Must have noticed that her love for him wasn’t the same anymore.
And after a few talks -that were mostly like talking against a wall because she
hadn’t really listened to him then; she had just too much to think about Buffy
at that moment- he had told her that he had to leave. She had been totally
destroyed after that. It took a few days before she had even left her room
again. ‘Heh’ It was in a special way funny to think about that now. It was
actually Buffy’s urging that had convinced her to leave her room and go out
again. ‘Buffy... GOD how much I love her. If she hadn’t been there then, then I
would have probably stayed in my room for the rest of the holidays.’</p>
<p>Buffy turned around to her. She had heard that last thought. "I love you
too"</p>
<p>Willow smiled but then noticed Buffy’s attention getting focused to
something else. She saw her switch into slayer mode. That was her sign to hide.
She walked to a group of bushes but then felt a hand on her arm. She turned her
head and saw Buffy shaking her head slightly as ever.</p>
<p>‘Don’t go there. The sound came from that direction and I don’t want to
loose you to whatever is there.’</p>
<p>Buffy had concentrated and tried to project her thoughts into Willow’s
brain. She saw her nodding and knew that she had been heard. Willow fell back
and the slayer headed with a small detour towards the bushes. She heard the
wicca start to chant and wondered what she did.</p>
<p>Then she saw it. A demon, about seven feet tall that faced her and seemed
to observe them. He didn’t seem to notice Buffy’s change of actions though. She
thanked her wicca for her abilities and then started an attack. The demon seemed
quite surprised to see her throwing a high foot at him and yanked back but not
enough. She hit him on what seemed part of his shoulder and had Buffy been a
normal human then her leg would probably have been shattered now. But she
wasn’t, she was the slayer and that gave her the ability to hit the demon hard
enough to throw it onto the ground. She jumped onto it crushing her knee into
the throat of that whateveritwas and punched it a few times into the face. A
little dizzied but not beaten yet it yanked Buffy off and threw her ten feet
towards Willow.</p>
<p>"NO!! Buffy!"</p>
<p>She held her hands up and that seemed to stop Buffy’s flight. She was
shocked and lost her concentration just long enough to let Buffy fall onto the
ground. The slayer jumped up and wanted to attack the demon to finish it but
couldn’t see it anymore. Suddenly she was hit hard flying another ten feet and
just mere inches past a tree. She knew that it must have been the same kind of
demon that had attacked her only a week ago. What had Giles called it? Illusion
Weaver. Well it surely did use illusions to hide itself. But Willow had shown
her that it wasn’t always invisible. Either had she made it visible or disabled
its illusions but whatever it was she had to repeat it.</p>
<p>"Will, do it again!"</p>
<p>"Wha- what? Do what again?"</p>
<p>‘Make him visible!’</p>
<p>She understood and started to chant again. A few moments later they could
both see the demon. Or at least the rest that was still left. They saw it run
through the trees and beyond vision.</p>
<p>"That was close."</p>
<p>"Buffy are you ok?" Willow asked, a very worried look on her
features.</p>
<p>"Yes I’m ok just a little dizzy. You?"</p>
<p>"I’m fine, it didn’t attack me."</p>
<p>"Ok I think that we were able to scare it away but I am sure that we
shouldn’t stay here for long. Let’s get to Giles and tell him ‘bout
this."</p>
<p>Willow nodded and they headed towards his house.</p>
<p>"By the way where did you find that spell?"</p>
<p>"To make him visible?"</p>
<p>"Mmm hmmm"</p>
<p>"It was in one of the books Giles gave us. It was quite hidden although and
I just found it through pure luck."</p>
<p>"Can you think of doing that when the ‘Big Battle’ starts?"</p>
<p>"Probably not. And I would have to cast it for every single demon again. It
hasn’t got any area effect to affect more than one of those hideous beasts. I
still don’t think that I already have the power to do it more than for two or
three anyway. And I have to concentrate on the gateway spell and that is quite
difficult and... and I’m babbling right?"</p>
<p>"As sure as you are Willow Rosenberg and as sure as I love you with all
your pros and cons."</p>
<p>Willow started to smile and moved closer to Buffy, then leaned over and
kissed her.</p>
<p>They went the rest of the way in silence enjoying the warmth of their
partner and the closeness that they shared.</p>
<p>At Giles house they started to tell him about what had happened and then
about that strange thing that had stopped Buffy’s flight. But he didn’t have any
idea what that could have been except that in someway Willow’s abilities had
grown. After another 15 minutes of talking and trying to explain what had
happened Xander knocked and entered, three IR-glasses in a box he
carried.</p>
<p>"Sorry but I couldn’t take more. It would have been too suspicious even for
the Hellmouth."</p>
<p>"It’s ok, I think it should be enough. Buffy if you could please get the
book over there. I have to find out what Willow and I need for the
spell."</p>
<p>"Sure"</p>

<p>After about 3 more hours of research and a shopping trip to the local
-which was at the moment the only- magic store to get the ingredients and
picking Cordy up on the way back to Giles’ house they decided to call it a
night. Xander and Cordy went back to -meanwhile- their shared house and Willow
and Buffy decided to stay at Willow’s house cause her parents were out of town,
which was not that unusual, it was simply closer than the dorm. They stopped on
their way to buy some ice cream and borrow a few videos -those that were not
already part of Willow’s parents steadily growing collection- and then left the
Hellmouth outside for the night as they entered the house. They really didn’t
want to go out now and lucky them, it stayed outside.</p>
<p>"How bout this?" Buffy asked holding one of the borrowed videos
up.</p>
<p>"Hmmm? Oh sure, although I probably wont pay much attention to
it."</p>
<p>"Willow..." It was a playful voice and the redheads reaction to it was
exaggerated seriousness, which soon was followed by loud laughter. They both
really enjoyed the others presence and Buffy had to admit that Willow was
absolutely right. They really didn’t pay any attention to the video. They just
sat on the couch and were kissing through the whole film and beyond the end of
it. Forgetting all around them. After a while they both fell to sleep and were
grateful that they would wake up next morning in the arms of each
other.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>It was about 3am as Buffy woke up. She thought she had heard something. She
checked the surroundings and then a second time with the IR-glasses on. She
didn’t find anything and decided to go back to bed. She went upstairs as a small
moan caught her attention. She went back into the living room, picked Willow up
and carried her up into her bed. Soon after that they were both asleep snuggled
into their love and enjoying the others warmth.</p>
<p>But what they didn’t know was that they were being observed. And it wasn’t
one of the local voyeurs that did that. Nor one of the ‘good demons’ as there
were a few in town -though only very few. It was one of the better scouts that
had learned to avoid most tracking devices or similar and knew exactly what to
do now. It continued its observation for a few minutes and then left to report
this new development to his master.</p>
<p>‘The slayer and another girl together. This is really interesting. And by
the way she looked at that little redhead it must be love. Love... such an
unnecessary emotion. Just distracting and dangerous. It makes her vulnerable.
Well I should be grateful for that.’</p>
<p>With that last thought it rushed into the darkness leaving the two lovers
another night to enjoy themselves before they would die...</p>
