<p><b>WELL. This chapter was forced out of me by X-LonelyGirl-X (Yes, you know of her), who would not leave me be! But it's her special day, so this is her present :) One of them anyway... Wish muh buddy all the best and whatnot.</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I strained to see over the crowd swarming around me, intent on finding a head of tussled blonde hair among the darker coloured shades. The bodies were gradually dispersing, but I still couldn't locate the girl I sought. I had promised to guide Lilly throughout the school, but that was pretty hard to do if she wasn't even here. I anxiously watched the school's entrance, hoping she would burst through the doors with an apologetic grin on her face and an explanation as to why she was so late. Lilly seemed eager to be at school with me the day she told me she was coming here, so I couldn't understand why she wouldn't turn up on time.</p>
<p>"Miley, come on. If she's late, she's late. You don't want to get in trouble, do you?" Travis said, wrenching me from my saddening thoughts. I glanced at him with a faint pout, aimed one last look at the double doors, and then joined him as we walked to first period.</p>
<p>As I sat in the classroom, I stared at my desk, reading the small carvings people had made over the decades. I just wanted to know what was taking Lilly so long! She's over an hour late because she wasn't in home room and now first period is reaching its midway point. I was beginning to grapple with the idea of her not coming at all, deciding it wasn't worth her time to let a loser like me show her around...</p>
<p>A scrunched paper ball landed on my desk and I jumped, glaring at it. I didn't bother glancing from the direction it had come from, knowing exactly who had thrown it. I was tempted to just disregard it, but a light kick to the back of my chair pushed me to peevishly tear open the rumpled paper. I found its contents to be a quickly scrawled message, which read 'look up'. I did as instructed with a raised eyebrow and was stunned to find Lilly standing at the front of the classroom, speaking to the teacher with a shy smile. To say the least, my spirits had suddenly lifted immensely and all of my anxieties vanished in the face of Lilly's presence.</p>
<p>She finished conferring with the teacher and faced the class, meeting my eyes with a questioning look. I pointed to the seat next to mine, which I had saved especially for her, and she happily took it.</p>
<p>"Late much?" I asked and Lilly frowned ashamedly.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry Miley. I was distracted and when I finally looked at the clock, I freaked out and got here as fast as I could."</p>
<p>"Hey, it's no problem at all Lilly. You're here and that's all that matters," I said, wanting to smooth Lilly's creased features.</p>
<p>"I hope you didn't think I was gonna ditch you or anything," Lilly muttered as the teacher ordered us to lower our volume.</p>
<p>"Psh, no way," I whispered back.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I escorted Lilly around the school cheerfully, but she seemed to be more interested in discussing my life than learning about fractions or the history of America or anything else each lesson offered. Usually, I paid attention in class, but Lilly just wanted to know so much so often that I couldn't concentrate and I didn't have the heart to tell her to ask me later when she beamed that sweet smile and gazed at me with those hopeful blue eyes. They really were something... I was certain they were identical to Princess'.</p>
<p>"Hey Miley, are you gonna introduce me to the legendary Lilly, or what?"</p>
<p>I turned to see Travis heading our way with one of his friends, Lucas, and rolled my eyes.</p>
<p>"I was working my way to it," I said with a frown, but Travis ignored me and helped himself to Lilly's hand.</p>
<p>"I'm Travis, it's a pleasure to meet you," he said kindly with a grin and I discovered that this was the first time I envied and belittled his handsome smile. I studied Lilly, her expression remaining polite as she exchanged pleasantries with Travis. There was no indication of anything more and knowing that, for some bizarre reason, soothed my unease. The moment Travis left after shooting Lilly one last glimpse of interest, she faced me with a knowing look.</p>
<p>"You've been talking about me," she boasted.</p>
<p>"No I haven't," I defended weakly.</p>
<p>"Then how did the lovely Travis know my name?"</p>
<p>"He just... Be quiet," I countered, hurrying into the classroom as Lilly basically pranced after me with a smug smile. I glowered at her as she sat next to me and I then looked away, my irritation growing as I heard her giggle.</p>
<p>"Don't be like that... I think it's sweet that you've been talking about me," she said, prodding my arm and I warily cast my gaze in her direction. The endearing twinkle in her eyes softened me up some and I sighed relentingly.</p>
<p>"I guess I was a little excited about you coming here," I confessed.</p>
<p>"Me too. This school is actually pretty great."</p>
<p>"Why's that?"</p>
<p>"Because you're here."</p>
<p>Now, I do believe that is the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Lilly had left as soon as the bell had rung, offering me nothing other than an abrupt goodbye and a lack of a reason. I wasn't sure who she lived with, if anyone, but I thought that maybe she had a curfew to abide by. I didn't question her because I knew she was a private girl, but my curiosity was driving me wild! I wanted more than a nonchalant shrug when I asked about her family and I wanted more than a distant stare when I asked where she moved from. But I couldn't be pushy, not yet. I'd only known her for a few weeks, so I had to be patient and give her time to burst from her self-inflicted shell of mystery. Though I had no clue as to how much longer that would take, and I'm not positive how much longer I can remain civil, calm and collected.</p>
<p>Lost in my mind, I didn't notice the rock protruding from the dirt road and my foot collided with it. I stumbled forward and threw my hands out in front of me, but something stopped me from being completely slain by gravity and I never quite hit the ground. I was slowly pulled upright and when I was safely standing straight again, I turned to see Princess gazing up at me, her tail wagging excitedly as she panted. I chose to pay no heed to the drool mark she had left on my shirt after releasing it, and bent down to her level. She stopped panting and tilted her head to the side questionably, adorably.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Princess. You saved me from a nasty fall, so I think you deserve a reward. How's that sound?" The wolf was still for a moment, looking into my eyes with a shocking intensity, as if she were actually taking her time to ponder my inquiry. I blinked and the sombreness vanished in an instant as she delivered a hasty lick to my cheek.</p>
