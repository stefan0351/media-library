<p>Author's note: All the reviews are freaking me out. Seriously, I looked at my email and was like "WHAT!" A good freak out, though. ;) Keep it coming.</p>
<p>disclaimer: Don't own it. Had to make it short 'cause I'm typing by candlelight and I thinks its about to go out...</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Viola was in good spirits. The second she had walked on campus, the new Sebastian was received by open and enthusiastic arms. To the guys he was a God, to the girls he was suddenly and inevitably irresistibly attractive. Viola had to deal with coy looks, slaps on the back and butt-pinching from anonymous sources all day yesterday. Viola was inwardly embarrassed by all the attention she was getting, but she was undeniably enjoying herself.</p>
<p>Looked like Sebastian had put himself on everybody's radar. Though, it wasn't getting her any closer to her soccer goal. Duke didn't even look at his roommate all day, blatantly ignoring her when she asked him something about soccer. Viola cringed inwardly. Duke was, after all, the team captain. If she got on his bad side then there was absolutely no chance she'd ever get to play against Cornwall. Maybe that whole fake-date with Olivia wasn't such a good idea after all. She made a mental note to discuss this with Olivia later on in the day.</p>
<p>Viola contemplated all this while she was taking a shower at girl's dorm. She had to admit, sneaking into this place to shower was a hell of a lot easier than trying to scare all the guys out of the showers by using ghost noises and spreading rumors about dangerous hygiene issues spreading around. The showers were empty right now since it was early in the morning and Viola was thoroughly enjoying the warm water and privacy.</p>
<p>Olivia walked into the girl's showers, sweating from the early jog. Today had been particularly vigorous. She had pushed herself so hard had broken her record by half an hour. Wasn't her fault though, it was all those DREAMS! Olivia shook her head to clear the very clear and vivid image of skin on skin from her mind's eye. The blond sighed as she peeled her damp tank top and shorts off and grabbed a towel for a shower.</p>
<p>Good thing she had never seen Viola naked before or then she'd really be having dream issues!</p>
<p>Olivia drew the curtain...stared... then closed it again. It didn't take long for the full-body blush to kick in and make her light-headed.</p>
<p>"Olivia, didn't hear you come in!" Viola greeted jovially from the other side of the curtain, apparently unfazed. She had been surprised when the curtain had been pushed aside and she saw Olivia's face. The blonde's eyes had widened significantly as she took in Viola's naked form under the spray of water. Viola had never seen anyone's face get so red in the span of a couple of seconds. It was cute, in a funny sort of way.</p>
<p>"..." For some reason Olivia couldn't remember how to connect her brain and her mouth. "... uh," slowly her basic motor functions came back to her. "I was... going to take a shower..." Olivia said quietly, still feeling dizzy due to the abrupt blood re-routing.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I could see that." Viola responded with a short laugh. "Come on in! The water is very nice!" Viola invited. Olivia felt faint.</p>
<p>"No thanks!" she responded quickly. Viola pouted inside the shower. She had wanted Olivia to join her... For some reason unknown to her.</p>
<p>"Alright, have it your way!" the brunette called out, deciding to quickly finish. Olivia sighed in relief and wrapped her towel around her torso. She leaned against one of the sinks and tried to think of her happy place. Easier said than done since FREAKING NAKED VIOLA WAS PAINTED ON THE INSIDES OF HER EYELIDS!</p>
<p>"Shit." Olivia mouthed to herself. She hardly ever swore, but this situation afforded her the perfect opportunity to do so. She rubbed her fingers over her eyes, trying to get her rampaging mind to calm itself. How could she ever look Viola in the eyes after this? Without picturing hot rivulets of water running down her tanned athletic but clearly feminine body... "Shit." she repeated.</p>
<p>"So, hope you enjoyed the free show." Viola teased as she stepped out of the shower whilst wrapping a white towel around her wet torso. Olivia's eyes shot opened and she turned away quickly, only to discover she could still see Viola's reflection in the mirror. The brunette's eyes were filled with mischief and a teasing grin played on her lips. Olivia's heart made small flips in her chest before she looked away.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were in there." Olivia apologized, blushing once again as she relived the encounter in her mind. Viola shrugged it off.</p>
<p>"Don't sweat over it, we're both girls. No matter what I might have lead everyone else to believe." Viola said happily, feeling clever with herself. Olivia winced slightly at the statement. "Hey, do you want to hear a knock knock joke?" Viola suddenly asked, facing Olivia with excited eyes.</p>
<p>"No." Olivia quickly responded automatically.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you anyway. Knock, knock." Viola said. Olivia thought she was going to loose her mind at the way Viola's towel was slipping slowly but surely.</p>
<p>"Who's there?" she forced herself to say. The soccer player was completely oblivious to her companion's current plight.</p>
<p>"Oh, you heard this one already." Viola burst out laughing at the corny joke. Olivia stared at the taller girl's now shaking chest and toned arms supporting her against the sink from how hard she was laughing.</p>
<p>"Ha ha." Olivia said awkwardly, trying to look away before she got caught. "Very original." she said distractedly as she pushed off the sink and headed towards the empty showers in a rush. Tearing herself away from Viola's side proved much harder than she had originally thought.</p>
<p>Viola's amused eyes followed her away, eyes instinctively drawn to the naked view of Olivia's back and shoulders. Viola looked away quickly before she was caught, and hint of a blush worked its way to her own cheeks before she shook her head, convinced it was just from laughing too hard and gathered up her things to go.</p>
<p><i>Cold shower cold shower cold shower...</i> Olivia chanted in her mind as she frantically turned the knobs to full blast.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A/N: Yeah, its short. What can I say, I didn't want to keep you waiting! :)</p>
