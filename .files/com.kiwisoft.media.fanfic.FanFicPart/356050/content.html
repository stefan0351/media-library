<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Fifteen -->

<p>Terri sat on her bed, and began to draw. She glanced at the clock, realizing that it was almost nine o'clock and the dinner she had prepared was getting cold. She already ate, and now waited for Noemí to get home; she feared that she had gotten drunk again. Her drawing this time, that of a sleeping Noemí, caught the detail of the long lashes resting against her cheeks, of her tousled hair falling over her forehead, of her lithe body curved like a child's sleeping on her side. She laid her head against the headrest and wondered why she couldn't get Noemí out of her mind long enough to draw something else.</p>
		<p>She started as she heard the sound of the key in the lock, and she went to the living room. Noemí smiled as she walked in and walked up to her. She kissed her forehead tenderly. Terri smiled up at her, but didn't fail to notice her wrinkled clothes or the smell of another woman's perfume that clashed with her usual cologne. Her shirt, open three buttons, had a lipstick stain at the collar; Noemí had pulled it out from her trousers, rolled the sleeves up carelessly. Her wet hair smelled of Herbal Essence. "I made dinner for you." Terri said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí threw her keys on the coffee table and turned to smile at her. "Great, because I'm starving." She said, to Terri's surprise, and made her way to the kitchen. She began to serve herself, but Terri urged her to sit and let her do it, since she made less of a mess.</p>
		<p>She placed the plate in front of her and sat to talk with her. Noemí dug into her food immediately, and moaned with satisfaction. Surprised, Terri watched as Noemí ate her dinner of mashed potatoes, corn and meatloaf hungrily. "How are you?" She asked Noemí, getting up and pouring her the agreed nightly glass of brandy.</p>
		<p>"I feel good," Noemí said between mouthfuls, and nothing more. She finished her dinner quickly and washed her own dish. She turned to Terri and smiled gratefully. "Thank you, it was delicious, and I'm sorry I came home so late."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded and left the kitchen; ignoring the glass, Noemí went after her and stopped her with a gentle hand on her shoulder. Terri spun around to face her, an unreadable expression on her face. "Are you angry because I missed dinner?" Noemí asked.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and smiled at her again. "Just call me when you're going to be late, Noemí, so that I know if I should cook for you or not." She explained, and Noemí nodded.</p>
		<p>"Okay, I'm sorry, I mean it." Noemí said softly, and smiled that endearing smile of hers again, her eyes crinkling a little at the corners. She looked around at the living room. "I need to get you a television, so that you don't get bored here by yourself."</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and laughed. "No, no, I don't want to be a couch potato." She responded; she reached up and cupped Noemí's face gently with her hand, then turned to walk away.</p>
		<p>"Terri." Noemí said softly, and Terri turned around with question in her eyes, hearing something in Noemí's voice. "Can we talk?" Terri sighed softly and went to sit on the couch, looking up at her with silent question. Noemí sat beside her and half turned on her seat to look at her. "We're friends, right?" She asked, and Terri nodded, looking a little confused by the question. "Be honest with me, now." Again, Terri nodded. "I went to bed today with an employee of mine," A slight pause as she looked away from her to the window. Her eyes returned to Terri and she continued. "Do you think it is wrong, you know? I still love Amelia so much, and I feel so guilty beneath it all." She looked at Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri smiled, and couldn't stop herself from reaching out and touching Noemí's soft face again. She couldn't seem to stop touching her lately. "I don't want to sound insensitive, Noemí, but Amelia is dead." She said softly, and Noemí looked away, swallowing hard. Terri's eyes moved all over her face, and she took a deep breath, trying to stop the shaking inside her. "Amelia wouldn't have wanted you to suffer for her in the way that you have been for the past few years, I'm sure of it. From what I hear from every body, specially you, she was a wonderful person, and she wasn't selfish." Noemí nodded and looked at her again. "Do what you have to do." She grinned as she met her eyes. "So who is this woman?" She asked, punching her playfully, very lightly on the chin.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled, reaching for her hand and holding it gently in hers. "Her name is Camilla Cortez, and she is the director of finances. Very smart and attractive." She answered, and then shrugged. "I don't know what else to say about her, maybe I should get to know her."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled, and stifled a yawn, pulling her hand from the warmth of Noemí's. "Well, like I said, do what you have to do," She said, and stood up. "And have fun doing it." She stepped over Noemí's leg and made her way to the bathroom, a hand on her lower back. "God, my back hurts!" She said softly to herself.</p>
		<p>Noemí remained sitting on the couch, staring at her reflection on the darkened window. After a few minutes, she could hear Terri come out of the bathroom and go into her bedroom, she didn't close the door; seconds later, the light in there went off. Scratching at the scar on her thigh, Noemí stood, turned off all the lights, and went to the bathroom also, closing the door behind her. The bathroom, still warm from Terri's shower, had a lingering scent of strawberries that Terri smelled so beautifully of.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Shaking again, unable to sleep, Noemí lay on the couch. Blinking rapidly, she trembled as flashes danced behind her eyes. She moaned softly, and turned over on her side. Darkness surrounded her, and she unwillingly remembered the night of the accident as if it were yesterday. It was as if she dreamed with her eyes open, and her surroundings blurred...</p>
		<p><i>They are returning home, the light of Victoria's car behind them a comfort and companion. They are holding hands, talking away and listening to music. Amelia smiles and she feels her baby kick; she puts Noemí's free hand on her stomach to feel too. Ecstatic, Noemí can't wait until that baby comes out so that they can hold it, and snuggle it, and spoil it. The already love it so much, they're already making plans for its life, for when the baby grows old enough to go to college?</i></p>
		<p><i>And suddenly the big bright lights come at them, already trying to swerve towards the correct side of the road, and hitting them on the side, sending them flying off the road, into a ditch?</i></p>
		<p>The next images made her moan with fear.</p>
		<p><i>Noemí comes to, finding her right arm crushed between something hard on one side, and something sickeningly warm, soft and wet on the other? Amelia's groan, her face turning to Noemí with frightening certainty, her voice hoarse and wet with the blood coming from within her body... "Our baby-" Our baby! Her last words, her eyes remaining fixed on Noemí, dead, dead? Our baby! Noemí screaming loudly, frantically; she can't move, pinpricks of pain all over her body? Victoria's voice screaming her name from far away, almost insane with fear and anxiety. Unable to move her face, pain when she tried, having to look at Amelia's dead face and eyes. Unable to close her eyes either, feeling that death would come if she did... Stench of blood, blood! And then her eyes closing without her wanting them to, and the cold? cold unconsciousness!</i></p>
		<p>Noemí sat up with a jerk, her forehead wet with sweat. She fought the urge for a drink, knowing there remained only one bottle in the house; the one Terri had hidden somewhere to control her hunger for the alcohol. Wishing she had taken the drink Terri had poured for her before, she stood up and paced the room, groaning and stumbling when her toe crashed against the coffee table. She breathed hard, running her fingers through her hair; she could feel the sweat breaking out from her pores, drenching her shirt, her hair. She moved towards the hall, needing the closeness, the comfort. "Terri," She whispered softly, unable to move into the hall, not knowing if Terri would welcome her again.</p>
		<p><i>Fear!</i></p>
		<p>She felt along the wall as she finally walked down, feeling past doors, touching the only open one. She stood at the door, staring into the darkness towards where the bed would be, breathing harder, her body shaking more as she came closer to tears. By then, her hair had matted against her forehead, the sweat ran in rivulets down her face, and she didn't know what to do. She turned to the bathroom door, and opened the door softly. She turned on the light, and staggered to the sink. She turned on the cold water, and cupped her palms beneath it, bringing them to her face. The cold water didn't do anything to help her anxiety attack, and she shut it off, almost hyperventilating now.</p>
		<p>She straightened her back and looked into the mirror; someone stood behind her. She cried out, and lost her footing, ending on her buttocks on the floor, back against the wall. Then someone knelt besides her, touching her face, saying something in a soft sweet voice. She couldn't recognize the voice, and she looked up at the kind face. "Terri." She wheezed, and reached for her frantically. "Help me! <i>Help me!</i>"</p>
		<p>Terri held her tenderly, telling her to hang on, to relax, to breathe in, and breathe out. Slowly, Noemí. Breathe in, and breathe out. Soon, Noemí felt her breath relax, her face pressed against Terri's chest, her arms wrapped around her. "Why didn't you come to me, Noemí?" Terri asked her softly, touching her hair over and over. Noemí shook her head, and pulled back to look at her. She couldn't answer, and Terri pulled away from her and stood up, helping her stand also. "Come to bed."</p>
		<p>Terri tucked her into bed, covered her from shoulder to feet with the covers, uncaring of her sweat. Noemí still shook. Terri lay down beside her and Noemí reached frantically for her, pulling her close. She brought her legs under the covers and wrapped her arms around Noemí's neck, holding her tenderly close. "You know you can talk to me. Tell me, what's the matter?" She whispered softly.</p>
		<p>She felt Noemí shake her head, felt her bury her face against her neck. "I can't." She whispered against her skin, her hand at the lower plane of her back pulling her growing stomach tightly against her own flat stomach. The baby kicked its complaint against the pressure, but it didn't move again. Terri's hand moved lower along Noemí's long back, and she pulled her shirt up a little to allow the tips of her fingers to trail softly along the smooth skin of her lower back. The caress seemed to comfort Noemí and she lay still, her shaking stopping, and her breathing slowly deepening into that of sleep.</p>
		<p>Terri decided she had to talk to Noemí's parents, to at least let them know what was happening with their daughter, who seemed to be so at peace in the daytime, but at night, her nightmares took claim of her sanity.</p>
