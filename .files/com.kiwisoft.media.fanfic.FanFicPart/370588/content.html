<p><hr size=1 noshade>Before breakfast the next morning Trina assembled the occupants of Cabin 13 in front of the building.</p>
<p>"Boy, oh boy," commented Lilly nervously to Miley, "we're really going to get it! I've never seen the clones so mad as last night coming home on that bus!"</p>
<p>"I wonder if they've found out they forgot Lauren," said Miley mildly.</p>
<p>"You mean they left her at Silver Lake?" cried Lilly. "And you knew? And you didn't tell anyone?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, her eyes gleaming. "Trina told me to shut up, so I did."</p>
<p>"Well, girls," said Trina, walking up and down in front of the girls like a drill sergeant, "tomorrow is visiting day."</p>
<p>"Already?" said Miley in mock surprise.</p>
<p>"Yep," said Trina philosophically. "Time sure flies when you're having fun."</p>
<p>There was a half-insane titter from Lilly.</p>
<p>"Can it, Truscott!" snapped Trina. "Okay, seriously, girls—your parents are coming tomorrow and the camp has to look terrific, right?"</p>
<p>"Wrong," said Miley firmly. "If this is a plea for unpaid labor, I wantcha to know I don't clean."</p>
<p>A scowl formed on Trina's face, but with effort she turned it into a big smile. "Oh, yes you do, Stewart. You do lots of things. You'd be amazed at what you do."</p>
<p>"In other words," said Miley, "you're planning to use force to make me help tidy up the camp."</p>
<p>"Right," grinned Trina. "Okay, guys, visiting day means that camp is half over. Let's make the second half even better than the first."</p>
<p>"It can hardly miss," deadpanned Miley.</p>
<p>"And," added Trina meaningfully, "let's have some of us trying to improve our behavior, shall we?"</p>
<p>"I think she means us," Miley stage-whispered to Lilly.</p>
<p>Lilly snickered loudly.</p>
<p>"Okay," said Trina. "There's a lot of work to be done around the place. Let's have some volunteers."</p>
<p>Miley's hand shot up into the air. "Lilly and I volunteer to tidy up the boating dock."</p>
<p>Trina laughed out loud. "No chance, Stewart. You and Truscott are going to work where I can watch you."</p>
<p>"There's no trust in this place," lamented Miley.</p>
<p>"No, not since you came along," said Trina. "Come on, now, where are my volunteers?"</p>
<p>Miley's hand shot up again. "Lilly and I volunteer to go and test the main motor launch," she offered. "We wouldn't want our parents to have a rough ride or to sink or anything."</p>
<p>"No, thank you, Stewart," grinned Trina. "Now look, you guys, you're standing here waiting for breakfast. I want some volunteers or"—she glanced at Miley—"you don't eat."</p>
<p>Miley nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>"I'll sweep out the bunk," offered Sarah.</p>
<p>"I'll pick up litter in the compound," said Amber.</p>
<p>"I'll help clean the mess hall."</p>
<p>"I can help Amber with the litter."</p>
<p>"I'll wash the mess hall windows."</p>
<p>"I'll supervise the entire operation," offered Miley.</p>
<p>"Come on, Stewart," said Trina. "You and Truscott are going to scrub our floor."</p>
<p>"I don't do floors, windows, or anything else," said Miley plaintively.</p>
<p>"You do now," said Trina. "Come on, you guys. Let's go to breakfast."</p>
<p>"Look at that!" boasted Trina as several of her counselor friends filed through Cabin 13. "There's the soccer champion of the whole world, there's the heaviest hitter in baseball, there's the greatest chess master in history, there's the dancing darling of Silver Lake, there's the queen of the disappearing act herself! She and her faithful sidekick are scrubbing the floor!"</p>
<p>On her hands and knees on the floor, Miley looked up at her audience with a paralyzingly cold glare. Then she resumed her work. Lilly just kept on scrubbing, tight-lipped and red-faced.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Trina, "I've finally found Stewart's weakness. She's afraid of being beaten to death. I just told her about the days when I was my old high school's kickboxing champion."</p>
<p>Chantel laughed. "She could probably knock your head off."</p>
<p>"It does your heart good to see her on her knees," sighed Kitty.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do now, Stewart?" taunted Marina. "Climb in that bucket and sail away?"</p>
<p>Miley stood up and folded her arms. "Ladies, Lilly and I don't like the working conditions here. We"—she pulled Lilly to her feet—"are on strike."</p>
<p>"Yeah," squeaked Lilly.</p>
<p>Chantel started to laugh. "You've got a big mouth, Marina, and a big foot to fit in it. You too, Trina."</p>
<p>"Stewart—" said Trina warningly.</p>
<p>"We're on strike," Miley repeated. "We've gotta get over to arts and crafts to paint some signs so we can picket."</p>
<p>"Arts and crafts is all cleaned up and closed for tomorrow," said Chantel, "but I'd be happy to open it up for you."</p>
<p>"Hey, whose side are you on?" snapped Trina.</p>
<p>"That's quite obvious," said Chantel. "Now—this is how you handle a situation like this. Stewart, Truscott, be good girls and finish the floor."</p>
<p>"Gee, we'd like to," said Miley, "but it's against union regulations."</p>
<p>"I'll give her union regulations!" hollered Trina, shaking a big fist.</p>
<p>"Tell you what I'll do," said Chantel. "We're working under a tight deadline here, so I'll double your salaries."</p>
<p>"Oh, well," said Miley, "in that case the strike is settled." She and Lilly dropped down to their hands and knees and continued scrubbing.</p>
<p>Trina was dumbfounded. "Boy, is Stewart ever stupid!" she whispered. "She doesn't get a salary!"</p>
<p>Chantel shook her head resignedly. "The problem isn't Stewart."</p>
<p>Visiting day dawned dark and threatening. The air was still and muggy, and clouds hung low over the lake.</p>
<p>Marina knocked on the camp office door.</p>
<p>"Come in," said Ms. Warden.</p>
<p>"Uh—Ma'am," began the head counselor, "I hate to say this, but it looks like rain. I guess we'd better cancel the outdoor buffet and serve lunch in the mess hall."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my girl," said Linda Warden jovially. "I've seen a hundred mornings like this at Algonkian. Since the days of my grandfather, it hasn't rained once for an Algonkian parents' day. It's just the mist off the lake. It'll clear up."</p>
<p>"But Ma'am—" protested Marina, who had heard a rumble of thunder in the distance.</p>
<p>"Now, now, do as I say," reproached Ms. Warden. "Set up for the buffet."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," murmured Marina. Shaking her head, she left the office. "It's still on," she told her waiting crew.</p>
<p>"Is she nuts?" exploded Trina. "We're going to drown those parents!"</p>
<p>"It isn't going to rain," insisted Marina sarcastically. "Elias wouldn't stand for it."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," lamented Kitty. "In the middle of a thunderstorm we're going to have a picnic. And all because it's not allowed to rain on visiting day. Elias's law."</p>
<p>"Liberation day," declared Miley, animated as usual by the thought of leaving Algonkian Island. She was stuffing her things into her duffle bag. "I hope my daddy is the first to arrive. That way we can be the first to leave."</p>
<p>"Should I be packing too?" asked Lilly.</p>
<p>"Everyone who is going home today should be packing," said Miley.</p>
<p>Lilly strummed on her guitar, which had just been returned to her that morning. "Good as new," she commented. "It was nice of them to get it fixed, wasn't it, Miley?"</p>
<p>"They're all heart," said Miley sarcastically. "Remember, if <i>you</i> had smashed up the cabin you'd have had to fix your own guitar."</p>
<p>Lilly took out her suitcase and began neatly folding T-shirts.</p>
<p>Sarah walked in and stared at Miley and Lilly in surprise. "Hey, why are you packing? You guys haven't been kicked out, have you?"</p>
<p>"No such luck," said Miley.</p>
<p>Sarah laughed.</p>
<p>"We're hoping our parents will take us home," explained Lilly.</p>
<p>Sarah looked genuinely sorry. "Gee, that's too bad."</p>
<p>"No, it ain't," said Miley. "It's good. Very good."</p>
<p>Sarah laughed again. "Well, I'll say this for you, Stewart. You're a terrible camper, but you're the best camp director we ever had."</p>
<p>Miley stopped her packing and looked at the girl intently for a moment. "Even better than old Elias?"</p>
<p>"Heck," said Sarah, grinning, "that was before my time." She sobered. "You know, it's going to be pretty dull here without you guys."</p>
<p>Miley pointed to the suitcase under Sarah's bed. "Pack," she suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh, not me. I kind of like it here."</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "And you seem so sensible."</p>
<p>"Another thing about your leaving," Sarah said, playing her last trump card, "is that it'll make Ashley so happy."</p>
<p>Miley froze. "It almost makes me want to stay. Almost." She rummaged in her suitcase and came out with a marking pen and a piece of paper. Then, in a flowing script which showed that she was as skilled at calligraphy as she was at baseball, she wrote:</p>
<p><i>Betwixt these sheets sleepeth ye biggest twit in California.</i></p>
<p>Eyeing it with evident though unsmiling pleasure, she affixed it with a Band-Aid to Ashley's pillow.</p>
<p>The launch bringing the first group of parents arrived shortly before eleven. By noon all the parents, brothers and sisters were on the island enjoying a reunion with the campers.</p>
<p>Eight-year-old Jackson Stewart was looking distastefully around the compound. "What a stupid place!" he announced loudly. "Dad, why did you send Miley to such a stupid place?"</p>
<p>Trina, who had been chatting with Lilly's mother, turned abruptly and stared at Jackson, marveling at his resemblance to Miley, not only in looks but in attitude.</p>
<p>"I taught him everything he knows," said Miley proudly.</p>
<p>"I noticed," muttered Trina, moving off.</p>
<p>"Hey, Miley," piped Jackson, "How come all the counselors look alike?"</p>
<p>"They're cloned," explained Miley. She pointed at Marina. "From her."</p>
<p>A smiling Lilly Truscott walked over with her mother, father, and younger sister in tow. "Mom, Dad, Vicky—I want you to meet my friend Miley Stewart."</p>
<p>Miley solemnly shook hands all around and introduced her own father and Jackson.</p>
<p>Vicky turned large worshipful eyes on Miley. "Is it really true that you're the best baseball player in the world?"</p>
<p>Miley glared at Lilly. "What kind of letters have you been writing?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. "I couldn't write about what a wonderful time I was having, so I wrote all about you."</p>
<p>"Speaking of letters," remarked Robby Ray, "you wrote us an identical letter every time."</p>
<p>"Not exactly," said Miley calmly. "The number of days until visiting day varied with each one."</p>
<p>Lilly leaned over to Miley. "Have you asked him to take you home yet?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Not yet," said Miley. "I'm waitin' until after lunch. Once he's tasted the food here he'll have a better understanding of why I wanna leave."</p>
<p>"Look," announced Jackson loudly, "here come some more of those clone guys!"</p>
<p>In a group, Marina, Kitty, Ruby, Lucy, Chantel and Lauren walked over and introduced themselves to Miley's father.</p>
<p>"I sure wanted to meet you, sir," said Kitty.</p>
<p>"Me too!" echoed the others fervently.</p>
<p>Robby Ray rubbed the bridge of his nose tiredly and looked down at Miley. "The other parents don't seem to be getting this kind of attention. You've been at it again, haven't you?" He turned to Marina. "Has she been behaving herself?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we wouldn't know anything about that," said Marina quickly. "You'll have to ask Trina, her bunk counselor."</p>
<p>"I was speakin' to this Trina," said Mr. Stewart. "But every time I asked her about Miley she changed the subject." He sighed, looking at his daughter. "Oh, Miley!" he exclaimed in exasperation.</p>
<p>From the direction of Cabin 13, Trina approached, her face beet-red, a synthetic smile showing all her teeth. "Excuse me, please. I'd like to have a private word with Stewart and Truscott."</p>
<p>Miley and Lilly followed her to a secluded area near the cabins. From her pocket Trina produced the sign from Ashley's bed.</p>
<p>"Stewart, did you do this?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Miley briskly. "Elegant, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"It's downright nasty!" said Trina angrily. "Her parents almost saw it!"</p>
<p>"Well, it should come as no great shock to 'em," said Miley reasonably. "They know she's a twit. They're her parents, after all."</p>
<p>"<i>Stewart!</i>"</p>
<p>"She's yelling, Dad!" came Jackson Stewart's high-pitched voice. "The clone is yelling at Miley!"</p>
<p>"<i>Two</i> of you!" exclaimed Trina. "Two Stewarts!" She laughed and walked away, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," said Lilly's mother, "it looks as though our Lillian and your girl have been in some kind of mischief."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wouldn't worry," said Robby Ray. "I'm sure that if it were anything serious we'd have been notified."</p>
<p>"What did they do wrong, Mom?" asked Vicky.</p>
<p>"I'm sure it's nothing too bad, dear," said Mrs. Truscott, smiling. "The girls are just high-spirited because they're having such a good time at camp."</p>
<p>"I wonder…" said Mr. Stewart thoughtfully, gazing at his sober-faced older daughter.</p>
<p>"Mr. Stewart looks like an ordinary guy—a nice guy!" exclaimed Kitty.</p>
<p>"But those kids," put in Trina. "Did you see the younger one? He's almost as bad as Stewart!"</p>
<p>"Shhh!" said Marina sharply. "Ms. Warden's about to speak."</p>
<p>Ms. Warden rose and approached the microphone. "Greetings, campers and visitors. My name is Linda Warden, and I'm the camp director. This is Camp Algonkian Island. It was founded thirty-one years ago by my grandfather, Elias Warden."</p>
<p>"Dad, why are her legs like that?" asked Jackson Stewart loudly.</p>
<p>"Shh, Jackson Rod!"</p>
<p>"Somewhere in that crowd," whispered Trina to Marina, "Truscott is laughing her head off. Somehow she always gets a charge out of Ms. Warden's speeches."</p>
<p>Marina grimaced. "I know these speeches by heart and they're no laughing matter. Our boss could put a stone to sleep."</p>
<p>"This is the thirty-first annual Parents' Visiting Day," the camp director went on. "I invite all of you to join me in our traditional outdoor buffet luncheon. I look forward to chatting with as many of you as possible. Please enjoy yourselves."</p>
<p>Everyone turned to the buffet, which consisted of three long tables set up in the compound near the mess hall. Lunch was an appetizing display of sandwiches and salads. Cake, ice cream and drinks were being served at a smaller fourth table.</p>
<p>"<i>Yecch!</i>" exclaimed Jackson Stewart, chewing gingerly at an egg sandwich. "Boy, this food is terrible! Miley, do they make you eat this every day?"</p>
<p>Miley nodded. "Yes, they do. But usually it's much worse. The cook makes a beef stew you could build a mud hut with."</p>
<p>"You! Stewart! Shut up!" The cook stood, arms akimbo, glaring at Miley and her brother.</p>
<p>"Gee, Miley, everybody knows you," said Jackson proudly.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart walked up to where Ms. Warden, Marina at her side, was receiving some of the parents.</p>
<p>"I'm Robby Stewart. I'm Miley's father." He waited expectantly.</p>
<p>"How do you do?" said Ms. Warden blandly.</p>
<p>"We wrote you a letter about Miley," said Mr. Stewart anxiously, "about how difficult she can be, and how she didn't want to go to camp."</p>
<p>Marina turned pale. "There was a letter?" she blurted.</p>
<p>Ms. Warden smiled serenely. "Oh, yes, I remember. Her school guidance counselor recommended camp. Overanxious father," she chided gently. "Your daughter has been just fine here, as I knew she would be. She fit right in, isn't that right, Marina?"</p>
<p>Marina coughed violently to cover her consternation and swallowed hard. "Yes—Stewart—amazing kid." She turned disbelieving eyes on her employer. "You received a <i>letter</i> about Miley Stewart?" She cleared her throat carefully. "You—didn't mention anything."</p>
<p>Ms. Warden smiled wisely. "Since the days of my grandfather, Elias Warden, girls haven't changed," she said. "They're all born to go to camp."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm glad everything worked out," said Mr. Stewart dubiously. "It was very nice meetin' you." Miley's father walked away, eyeing Marina thoughtfully.</p>
<p>She knew, thought Marina in a cold fury, seeking out a nearby bench and sitting down heavily. I don't believe it. There was a warning about Stewart and she didn't tell anybody! When Trina and the girls hear about this they'll throw Warden in the lake!</p>
<p>Marina took a deep breath and most of the color returned to her face. Why put the girls through that? she thought. Especially Trina, who had been driven to desperation by Stewart's exploits. This was one revelation she'd keep to herself.</p>
<p>Her mouth full of potato salad, Trina walked over to where Marina was sitting. "Well, the boss was right," she mumbled. "It didn't rain on her buffet."</p>
<p>As if timed by some evil force of nature, the sky was rent by a jagged fork of lightning, followed almost immediately by a deafening clap of thunder. Without any further warning, the heavens opened and the rain came in a blinding downpour.</p>
<p>"This way, folks!" shouted Marina, now fully recovered from her shock and ready to take charge. She had been prepared for just such an emergency. "Into the mess hall!"</p>
<p>People began scurrying towards the shelter of the building, the Algonkian staff and some of the campers carrying the various plates of food. Trina grabbed the huge platter of potato salad and began to run across the already muddy ground towards the mess hall. Miley, Lilly and Jackson watched as, with a strangled cry, Trina slipped on the wet grass, then tripped over the doorstep and fell full-length into the mess hall, her face buried in the potato salad. The screen door blew shut, closing on Trina's mid-section. She lay there, her head in the salad, her legs in the rain.</p>
<p>Marina and Lauren came running to the door and hauled Trina inside. The awkward silence that followed was broken by a peal of laughter from Jackson Stewart. This set Lilly off, and soon the whole mess hall—campers, counselors and parents alike—was rollicking with mirth.</p>
<p>Sticky and humiliated, Trina ventured out into the raging storm to go to the wash station to clean up.</p>
<p>"I may have been wrong about this camp!" piped up Jackson enthusiastically. "This is fun!"</p>
<p>Miley stared at Jackson and then at Lilly. Lilly looked back intently.</p>
<p>"Man, this is the worst storm I've ever seen!" exclaimed Trina. "It's been coming down like this for over an hour!"</p>
<p>"I've never seen it rain so hard," moaned Marina. "What are we going to do with the parents for the rest of the afternoon? Everyone's getting restless."</p>
<p>"We sure can't have the soccer game," agreed Trina, gazing out the screen door of the mess hall where all were still trapped by the downpour. "The field's flooded. <i>Hey,</i> the field's <i>flooded!</i>"</p>
<p>There was a stampede of counselors to the door.</p>
<p>"The field should be wet, but it shouldn't be flooded like that!" exclaimed Ruby.</p>
<p>"Look at the water!" gasped Trina.</p>
<p>"There must be fifteen or twenty inches of it!" cried Marina. "Ms. Warden! Where's Ms. Warden?"</p>
<p>"In her cottage," said Chantel. "She took off when the rain started. I suppose I'd better go and get her. Elias would have wanted the captain to go down with the camp." She dashed off through the mud and the rain towards the camp director's cottage.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" called one of the parents.</p>
<p>"Nothing to worry about," smiled Marina reassuringly. "Everything is under control."</p>
<p>"Under control?" howled Trina. "Under control? It's a flood!"</p>
<p>There was a murmur throughout the mess hall as people began to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>"Unless I miss my guess," said Kitty in a low voice, "that water is spreading in this direction."</p>
<p>Miley and Lilly pushed their way to the door. "What's going on?" asked Miley mildly.</p>
<p>"Get out of here, Stewart!" barked Trina. "We've got enough trouble. We don't need you!"</p>
<p>The two girls and their counselors stood in openmouthed amazement as the water came on in a steady, shallow flow. It engulfed the mess hall and continued towards the cabins and other buildings, surrounding them and flowing on towards the lake.</p>
<p>"It's coming in!" shouted Trina.</p>
<p>The water had begun to seep in through the door and from under the floor boards. Soon everyone was up to the ankles in water, and still more was seeping in.</p>
<p>"Wow," exclaimed Lilly in the general excitement, "a disaster! A natural disaster! Miley, our natural disaster!"</p>
<p>Miley's studied poker face began to disintegrate. Her eyes gleamed, then danced. A smile cracked the veneer of her normally expressionless face. It grew until it extended from ear to ear. Miley Stewart laughed. She put her head in her hands and began to laugh uncontrollably, splashing her way over to the wall for support.</p>
<p>Lilly was thunderstruck. She had rarely seen Miley smile, let alone laugh.</p>
<p>"Cut it out, Truscott!" snapped Trina. "It isn't funny!"</p>
<p>"It's not me!" Lilly protested, almost speechless. "It's—her!" She pointed at Miley who was still doubled over with mirth, tears now streaming down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Trina stared in amazement. "Stewart. <i>Stewart!</i>"</p>
<p>Chantel staggered in the door, completely drenched.</p>
<p>"Did you get her?" asked Marina anxiously. "Where's Ms. Warden?"</p>
<p>"Trapped!" gasped Chantel. "Her cottage is in a valley and the water is up over the windows! She waved at me from the attic. She's okay."</p>
<p>"But we're not okay!" roared Marina. "What are we going to do?"</p>
<p>"There must be a blockage in the creek," suggested Chantel. "If a few of us can get in there and unblock it, the water will eventually either evaporate or drain into the lake, once it stops raining. Come on. I need eight or ten people."</p>
<p>"Lilly and I will go," choked Miley.</p>
<p>"Just counselors," ordered Marina. "Trina, Trina!"</p>
<p>"Stewart was laughing," said Trina abstractedly.</p>
<p>"She would be," said Marina. "I always knew it would take a disaster to get Stewart to crack a smile. Now, come on. We've got to go and unblock the creek."</p>
<p>A dozen counselors sloshed their way out the door and headed towards the woods.</p>
<p>"Boy, Pop," exclaimed Jackson Stewart loudly, "terrific stuff happens here! Can I go to camp here next year?"</p>
<p>"Ah," said Miley Stewart, her poker face reassumed, "things are looking up for the desperate flood victims. The sun is shining and Alcatraz is in ruins. Perfect."</p>
<p>Lilly had long since stopped laughing and had sobered. "Our stuff," she lamented. "It's going to be ruined! Your iPod! My guitar!"</p>
<p>"Take heart," announced Miley dramatically, "for your guitar has been located. And she's seaworthy. Look."</p>
<p>Lilly stared. A rainbow swept in a great colorful arc across Algonkian Island. The flood waters had begun to recede and an assortment of books, clothing, baggage and sports equipment bobbed on the surface, floating out to the lake. Amid the debris floated Lilly's guitar, its polished wood gleaming in the sunlight. Atop it perched the beaver, squinting around nervously.</p>
<p>"My guitar!" exclaimed Lilly.</p>
<p>"Don't complain," said Miley, sliding her hand into Lilly's between them. "That beaver needs it more than you do. Besides, we owe him something. I have a feeling he's the guy who finished the dam we started."</p>
<p>"I hope the salvage crew picks it up," said Lilly faintly, her heart hammering in her chest at the feelings Miley's hand in her own were stirring up. A group of counselors, led by Kitty and Ruby, had stationed themselves down by the dock and were rescuing Algonkian belongings before they slipped away into the lake.</p>
<p>"Attention, everybody," announced Marina. "We're going to serve an impromptu supper because the day—uh—lasted longer than we expected it to."</p>
<p>There was a laugh from the parents and a cheer from the campers.</p>
<p>Marina grinned sheepishly. "Ms. Warden will be joining us later, as soon as we can get her out of her attic."</p>
<p>This time the laughter was general, and Marina joined it.</p>
<p>"Are we going to spend the night here?" asked Jackson hopefully.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Marina assured him. "It was just a flash flood. The water's going down and we'll be able to ferry you to the mainland pretty soon."</p>
<p>"Dang," said Jackson. "I like it here."</p>
<p>"And so," said Linda Warden at eight o'clock that evening as the first group of parents prepared to board the launch, "another successful Parents' Visiting Day draws to a close."</p>
<p>"What does she mean 'successful'?" growled Trina to Marina.</p>
<p>"That's just her end of visiting day speech," grinned Marina. "She only has one, and it doesn't cover floods."</p>
<p>Except for the occasional puddle, all the water was gone, though the ground was still very muddy.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming to Camp Algonkian Island," went on Ms. Warden. "I trust you had a nice day. Goodbye, all."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, folks," Frank called out to the parents, "we're okay here. In a couple of days Algonkian will be all dried out and as good as new. Goodbye, everybody."</p>
<p>Robby Ray and the Truscotts were gathered in a small group talking with their daughters.</p>
<p>"Miles," began Mr. Stewart slowly, "from all your letters and your general attitude, I'm not sure you're happy here. I've decided to ask if you wanna come home with me and your brother now."</p>
<p>Trina, who had been diligently eavesdropping close by, craned her neck to catch Miley's answer.</p>
<p>Miley stared at her father, then at Lilly, and then back at her father. It all hit her like a load of bricks. Home? There was no Lilly at home (if her parents made her stay), no Ashley, no tales of Elias, no clones. There was nothing to do at home except to entertain a pesty little brother. Alcatraz had floods and beavers and irate cooks and bow-legged camp directors and Trina throwing herself into the lake all the time…why would anyone want to leave such obvious entertainment just to go home?</p>
<p>"Heck no," she said, eyes gleaming. "I don't wanna go home. They need me here. You heard the guidance department. It's good for me. I'm stayin' put."</p>
<p>Trina burst onto the scene. "Welcome to camp, Stewart! This is just great!" She clapped her hands onto Miley's shoulders.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" squeaked Lilly, confused but glad.</p>
<p>Miley wriggled out of Trina's grasp. "There is no need," she said blandly, "to become hysterical."</p>
<p>Trina laughed. Stewart hadn't changed.</p>
<p>After all goodbyes had been said and the launch had left on its last trip, marking the end of an eventful visiting day, Miley and Lilly seated themselves on a very wet bench in the center of the compound.</p>
<p>"Well?" said Lilly expectantly. "Tell me. Why did you decide to stay?"</p>
<p>"Simple," said Miley. "I haven't escaped yet."</p>
<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>
<p>"You don't think I'm going to admit that Trina and Marina and all those clones kept me here?" replied Miley. Her eyes gleamed diabolically. "Now that they think I'm here to stay, it should be easy to catch them off guard. You coming?"</p>
<p>"But," Lilly protested hoarsely. "What if we get away?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Then we score ourselves a point, come back and try again."</p>
<p>Lilly stared at her and then collapsed in a fit of helpless laughter.</p>
