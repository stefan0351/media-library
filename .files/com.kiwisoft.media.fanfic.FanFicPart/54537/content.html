<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Desire into Despair -->

<p>Sam lay curled up on her bed. She didn't want to get up. Some
part of her didn't want to face the reality that awaited her. (Surely I dreamed
what happened last night) she told herself solemnly. (Brooke didn't kiss me,
twice. My fragile, tiny little mind has finally snapped and I've lost it) She
pulled her knees even closer to her body and pulled the covers over her head.
(Or, if she did kiss me, she's going to realize she made a horrible mistake and
blame the whole thing on me and blab all over school that I'm gay) Tears started
anew. (My life is over) </p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the bathroom and in Brooke's room, Brooke
was pacing like a caged animal. (What was I thinking? It seemed like the right
idea at the time!) she told herself. Panic was the emotion of the morning. (Now
what do I do? What if she thinks I was just playing? I can't just let her think
that) Deciding she needed to talk to Sam, Brooke marched into the bathroom to
Sam's door and was surprised to find it locked. </p>
<p>"Sam? Sam you in there?" She was greeted by silence. She left
the bathroom, went out through her room into the hallway and tried Sam's hall
door. It was locked too. Now she was pretty sure Sam was in the room.
</p>
<p>"Sam, open the door, we need to talk," she asked. Still Sam
didn't answer her. She thanked God both their parents weren't home. It'd be hard
to explain why she was outside Sam's room begging to be let in. </p>
<p>"Sam, damn it, open the freaking door!" she yelled.
</p>
<p>"Go away!" the anguish-ridden voice surprised Brooke. (Why is
she upset? I thought.I thought.Jesus, I don't know what to think anymore) Brooke
sighed. She knew Sam was in love with her, she had heard the words from Sam's
own mouth, and she knew she felt something for Sam as well. Whether or not it
was love, Brooke couldn't be sure but it was strong and overwhelming and
couldn't be ignored anymore. (But) she conceeded (maybe kissing her and walking
away last night wasn't the wisest course of action. God, she's probably tied up
on knots trying to figure out what's going on) </p>
<p>"Sam," she called gently through the door, "open the door so
that we can talk." </p>
<p>"I don't wanna talk," Sam called back her voice still
anguished. Brooke shook her head forgetting for a second that Sam couldn't see
her. </p>
<p>"Sam, we have to talk about what happened last night," she was
cut off by something heavy connecting with the other side of the door. Brooke
figured it was a shoe but Sam had thrown something at her nonetheless. She
closed her eyes and sighed again. </p>
<p>"Fine, Sam, you don't want to talk, I understand that. But I
do. Since you've no where to go, I guess you'll just have to listen. I wasn't
just screwing around last night, I knew what I was doing. I meant what I was
doing. I wanted to kiss you," she confessed to Sam's closed door. Since she
didn't hear anything else hit the door, she continued. </p>
<p>"I know how you really feel about me, don't ask me how, I just
do," she didn't feel like explaining the whole easedropping incident right now.
"I feel something for you too and I want a chance to see where it'll take us,
Sam. Please?" she asked. Silence answered her. With one more heavy sigh of
resignation and having said her say, Brooke traced her hand over Sam's door. </p>
<p>"Think about it Sam. I'll see you at school." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam sat throughout Brooke's speech, enraptured by the words
floating through her door positively convinced that she was dreaming. (That's
not really Brooke) she told herself. (Brooke's straight) she chanted repeatedly
although Brooke's words clearly indicated otherwise. (She must have hit her
head) Sam reasoned logically. But the other half of her mind told her to shut
up. </p>
<p>((What if Brooke isn't straight? What if she does have
feelings for you?)) (No!) Sam argued with herself. (She's screwing around with
me because she somehow found out about my feelings and now she's going to use
them against me. Or she thinks she feels something that's not really there and
she'll realize she's made a mistake and blame me and I'll lose everything) Sam
continued to argue with herself for a good hour until she gave herself a
pounding headache and made herself late for school. </p>
<p>While she toyed with idea of skipping, she knew the school
would only call her mother and then she'd have to bluff her way out of a
doctor's appointment and it would be a royal mess by the time she was done. So
after grabbing a quick shower and getting dressed, she headed to school and
planned to avoid Brooke as much as possible. Which would be no easy task seeing
as they shared a few classes. </p>
<p>Brooke waited anxiously in Chem class for Sam. She knew Sam
was in school, she's seen her in the hall but every time she'd tried to approach
her, the skittish brunette had taken off in the other direction. She turned to
the door but still no Sam. She felt something hit her in the back of the head
and turned around to the source. Lily was glaring at her. </p>
<p>(What's you do?) Lily mouthed at her motioning at Sam's empty
seat. Brooke shrugged and shook her head. </p>
<p>(I don't know) she mouthed back. Lily rolled her eyes and blew
her bangs away from her forehead. </p>
<p>(If you hurt her.) Lily started. Brooke glared back at her. </p>
<p>(I know, I know) she mouthed back angrily. Nicole was watching
the entire exchange in extreme fascination. Just then, Sam walked in looking
rather flustered and sat down moving her seat as far from Brooke as possible and
still be at the same table. Lily's glare at Brooke grew hotter and Brooke
sighed. </p>
<p>"Sam, I wore deodorant this morning," Brooke said wryly. Sam
didn't look at her. </p>
<p>"Whatever," she answered plainly as she focused on Bio Glass
and the blackboard. </p>
<p>"Sam, talk to me," Brooke asked. Again, Sam didn't turn her
way. </p>
<p>"I'm trying to learn," she snapped. </p>
<p>"Esposito, eyes front. McQueen, McPherson, whatever petty
little squabble you little guttersnipes are presently involved in, while usually
fun to watch, aren't going to happen on my time, understood?" Bio Glass asked.
Sam shot Brooke a glare that was almost deadly. </p>
<p>"Yes sir." </p>
<p>"Yes ma'am." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You're going to have to talk to me eventually," Brooke argued
when she cornered Sam in the Novac later that day. Sam sighed and resisted the
urge to put her head through the mirror. </p>
<p>"What is there to talk about Brooke? You made a mistake. Fine,
I understand that. Let's move on," Sam said peevishly as she headed for the
door. Brooke moved to stop her. </p>
<p>"Is that what you think?" she asked surprised. "Sam, I didn't
make a mistake. I made a mistake by denying how I felt for you for so long." She
watched Sam's eyes get wide. </p>
<p>"What brought this on?" Sam asked suspiciously waiting for
Nicole and Mary Cherry to burst out at any minute with a video camera and expose
her sexuality for the school to see. </p>
<p>"I overheard you talking to Lily in the newspaper office a
while ago," Brooke confessed. "It made me realize somethings and one was that I
have feelings for you." Sam backed away. </p>
<p>"You can't do this to me," she protested. Brooke frowned. She
was SO confused. </p>
<p>"Do what, Sam? I'm telling you that I feel the same way you
do, isn't that what you want?" Tears were starting to flow down Sam's face. </p>
<p>"Yes!" she agreed. "But I finally had a grip on things. I
could finally face you and not feel the overpowering need to grab you and kiss
you senseless!" Sam ranted as she started to pace. "I was finally to a point
where I thought we could be friends and this wouldn't get in the way. I finally
had a handle on everything and you go and rip everything apart! That's not
fair!" Brooke tried to approach her but Sam backed away again. </p>
<p>"It doesn't have to get `in the way', Sam. Give it a chance,"
she started. Sam was shaking her head violently. </p>
<p>"No, you're wrong. You don't know what you want," Sam
declared. "You overheard me and Lily, you heard my confession and it intrigues
you but it's not real. And you'll discover that somewhere down the line and
blame me for this whole thing and I'll end up with my heart broken and wanting
to die and I won't do it, I just won't!" And with that she wrenched open the
door to the Novac and ran out before Brooke could stop her. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Hey, Lily," Lily jumped at the sound of Nicole's voice behind
her. She spun around to face the shorthaired blonde. Her eyes narrowed.
</p>
<p>"What do you want, Nicole?" she asked annoyed. Nicole frowned
and actually looked, wounded? </p>
<p>"Nothing, well, actually, I wanted to talk, somewhere in
private," Nicole said quietly. "I do have a reputation to uphold but I need to
talk to you." Lily rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Fine, whatever. But if this is some sort of plan to hurt me
or my friends, Nicole, I will hurt you," she snapped. Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"This is as above board as that ride home," she declared. Lily
still eyed her suspiciously as they entered the Novac. After making sure they
were alone, Nicole locked the door. </p>
<p>"All right, I'll bite, what do you want to talk about?" Lily
asked as she sat down. It wasn't everyday that Nicole Julian, Queen Bitch and
second in command at Kennedy High wanted to have a private pow wow with you.
Nicole licked her lips nervously. </p>
<p>"What's going on with you and Brooke and Spam?" well, always
blunt and to the point, that's Nicole. </p>
<p>"Her name is SAM," Lily pointed out. Nicole waved a hand at
her. </p>
<p>"Whatever, Sam. Well? I saw that little lip-reading session
with Brooke in Chem lab today and I saw Sp.Sam's reaction to Brooke today.
Something's rotten in Whoville and I wanna know what." Lily snickered.
</p>
<p>"Like I'd tell you if I knew," she stood up to leave.
</p>
<p>"Wait," something in Nicole's tone made Lily turn around. "Sit
please." Lily sat back down and so did Nicole. </p>
<p>"I know," Nicole started. "I know Sam has it bad for Brooke,"
Lily stared at her in open-mouthed shock. "Stop staring at me like that, Lily. I
also know you have a thing for Sam. You both wear it like badges whenever you
look at the object of your affection. Funny thing is, Sam was oblivious to you
and Brooke was oblivious to Sam until recently. Something changed now spill."
Knowing that telling Nicole was probably not the smartest thing but since the
girl already knew, what harm could there be, Lily spilled the entire story up to
present. Nicole sat silently for a few minutes. </p>
<p>"And you have no idea what Brooke did to upset Sam?' Lily
shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nope. And you're not bothered by the fact that Brooke is
gay?" Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, God, why would I care? I say whatever makes you happy, go
for it." Lily shook her head. </p>
<p>"Why can't you be like this all the time?" Nicole smiled
wryly. </p>
<p>"Not the part picked out for me, Lil," she said, a hint of
regret in her tone. "We all have our roles to play. You have yours, I have mine
whether we like the ones we have or not we have to play them." </p>
<p>"Why?" </p>
<p>"Upset the apple cart and the whole goes to shit, Lily,"
Nicole tried to explain. At Lily's blank look Nicole just sighed. "Sorry, my
mother's reasoning. You do as expected and don't rock the boat." </p>
<p>"Sad way to be," Lily pointed out. </p>
<p>"Why do you think I'm a bitch all the time?" Nicole asked with
a smirk. Lily laughed. </p>
<p>"Bitch or not, Nic, I wouldn't mind seeing more of this side
of you," Lily confessed. Nicole's smirk became a grin. (Brooke was oblivious to
Sam; Sam was oblivious to you; and you are oblivious to me, Lily. It's a cruel
world) </p>
<p>"Thanks Lily, that means a lot. So, what about Brooke and
Sam?" Lily sighed. </p>
<p>"Well, we could just wait and see if they straighten it out on
their own," she suggested. </p>
<p>"Or we can clean up their mess afterward." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke had looked everywhere but she could not find Sam. She
wasn't home, at school, at the cemetery, anywhere Brooke thought that she'd be
and she was starting to get worried. It was unlike Sam to just take off like
that and not tell anyone where she was going. Eventually, Brooke ended up at
Lily's front door. </p>
<p>"Hey Lily, is Sam here?" Lily's eyes narrowed and she shook
her head. </p>
<p>"No, she's not. Why?" Lily asked acid leaking into her tone. </p>
<p>"I uh, lost her?" Brooke asked afraid of pissing off the
diminutive Latina but knowing honestly was best. Lily exploded. </p>
<p>"YOU LOST HER? HOW THE HELL DID YOU MANAGE THAT?" Lily
screamed while dragging Brooke to her room. </p>
<p>"Well, it kind of started last night," Brooke hedged. Lily
stood there tapping her foot waiting for an explaination. "I kissed her and told
her we'd talk in the morning." Lily's eyes got wide and her jaw dropped.
</p>
<p>"You kissed her and walked away?" she hissed. "Whatever could
have possessed you? Why not try reverse Russian Roullette with her?" </p>
<p>"Lily calm down. I couldn't think of anything else. Words
failed me and I wanted her to know how I felt. So I kissed her," Brooke
explained lamely. Really, it seemed like such a good idea at the time.
</p>
<p>"But you walked away," Lily said. "Without explaining
anything. Oh, poor Sam has no idea what's going on." </p>
<p>"I tried to explain it to her," Brooke defended herself. Lily
turned on her a murderous glare in her eyes. </p>
<p>"After the fact! You don't get it, Brooke. She LOVES you and
you played with her, however unintentionally. You baited the hook with
everything she could ever desire and then snatched it out of reach. It's like
dangling the carrot in front of the horse to get it to walk forward. That was
cruel, Brooke." Brooke's shoulders slumped. She hadn't thought of it that way. </p>
<p>"I didn't mean to," Brooke whispered near tears. (God, I have
messed everything up and we haven't even started yet "What do I do now? I don't
even know where she is." Lily thought a minute. </p>
<p>"Go home, Brooke. She'll eventually go there, she has to. And
try to talk to her again. Apologize for the royal mess you've made," Lily glared
at her again. "I can't believe you," she breathed. Brooke stood up and glared
back. </p>
<p>"I made a God Damn mistake, Lily. Get off your freaking high
horse and get over it," she snapped before storming out. Lily just shook her
head. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, fix it before you make it worse, Brooke."
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p><font color="#3399FF">/A little out of character
and probably impossible but, eh, what the hell/ </font> </p>
<p>Brooke was waiting for Sam when she finally came through the door at nearly
three in the morning. </p>
<p>"Way past your curfew McPherson," Brooke said softly.
</p>
<p>"Bite me," Sam snapped as she staggered towards the stairs.
Brooke noticed the ungainly walk and was instantly alarmed. </p>
<p>"Where've you been?" she asked. Sam huffed at her. </p>
<p>"Who're you now, my mother?" Sam asked angrily. Brooke
approached her and watched as Sam tried to back away only to trip and land on
the stairs. </p>
<p>"You've been drinking," Brooke said in disbelief. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"My, you're quick this evening," she scoffed. Brooke shook her
head in disappointment. </p>
<p>"I wanted to talk to you but if this is how you deal with your
problems than I think you need to talk to someone else," she said sadly. Sam
stood back up. </p>
<p>"So I snuck into a bar and had a few, Jesus Brooke sue me!"
she exclaimed. "I've seriously had my head screwed with lately and wanted a
chance to forget about it, at least for a little while." Brooke started to walk
away. </p>
<p>"Hey, I've been sleeping the worst of it off in a motel since
11 so I'm not totally tanked Brooke. I didn't drive either. Cab fair nearly
sucked me dry. You wanna talk, talk." </p>
<p>"Not now, Sam, not like this," Brooke sighed. Sam scowled. </p>
<p>"Well, whenever you're good and ready let me know so that I
can clear my schedule, Your Royal Highness!" she yelled. Brooke spun to face the
irate and slightly inebriated brunette on the staircase. "You know, this has all
been about when you're ready. What about me? What about when I'm ready, huh?" </p>
<p>"Sam." </p>
<p>"No! I wanna talk now and you say not now. I wanted to talk
last night after you planted that kiss on me and you said tomorrow. I didn't
want to talk this morning but you did so you went right ahead, whatever Brookie
wants Brookie gets, is that it?" </p>
<p>"Damn it, Sam, no. And you know it. Why are you making this so
difficult?" Sam ran a hand through her disheveled hair. </p>
<p>"I'm not," she said calmer. "I just don't understand how you
go from being Brooke, heterosexual homecoming queen to Brooke, homosexual
stepsister kissing McQueen." Brooke walked a little closer and was relieved that
Sam didn't back away. But she could smell the stale beer on Sam and it turned
her stomach. </p>
<p>"Easy, apparently, according to my subconscious, who's a bitch
you don't want to meet her, I was never `Brooke, heterosexual homecoming queen'
or at least the heterosexual part. I was always the homosexual part, at least
where you're concerned." Sam arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"And I'm the drunk one," Sam laughed. "Oh, I so need to sleep
this off," she sighed. </p>
<p>"Chances are you won't even remember this conversation in the
morning, Sam," Brooke pointed out. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Yes I will," she argued. "I've got a mind like a steel trap." </p>
<p>"Or a cheese grate. Up to bed and we'll try this again
tomorrow when you're sober. But please Sam, don't do this again," Brooke asked.
Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"Do what?" </p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke warned as she walked Sam up to her room.
</p>
<p>"I know, I know. But it just hurt so much," Sam said as she
flopped down on her bed. Brooke blinked away tears at the confession.
</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Brooke apologized quietly. </p>
<p>""S'OK," Sam said around her pillow. Brooke pulled off Sam's
shoes and threw the blanket over her. "Night." </p>
<p>"Good night Sam." </p>
<p>"Love you," Sam mumbled as she rolled over and drifted off.
The comment caught Brooke off guard and she was ready to dismiss it as alcohol
induced but decided against it. She bent down and kissed Sam lightly on the
temple. </p>
<p>"You too, Sammy." </p>
