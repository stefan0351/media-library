<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 31 -->

<p>"Sam! Hey! You made it!"</p>
<p>Sam smiled as she entered. "It's not everyday a guy cooks for me." Harrison laughed as he closed the door behind her. Turning around, she took in Harrison's almost formal attire and glanced up at him warily, ignoring the faint warning bells sounding in her head. "Don't you look nice."</p>
<p>He grinned. "Thankyou. You look great as usual." Sam smiled as she began to remove her jacket. "Here, let me." Moving behind her, Harrison helped Sam out of her jacket, stopping suddenly as he caught a glimpse of her neck. "Is that a hickey?"</p>
<p>Sam froze, grateful that Harrison was standing behind her, unable to see the horrified expression on her face. <i>So that's what mum was looking at this morning!</i></p>
<p>"A hickey?" Sam laughed, nervously. "What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"It's there, on the side." Harrison looked at her unhappily. "You haven't been with another guy since Alex have you?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't" Sam answered guiltily, despite the fact that technically she was telling the truth. Brooke was definitely not a guy. </p>
<p>"Then what is it?" Harrison asked curiously, able to breathe again.</p>
<p>Sam moved over to the mirror and took a good look, cringing inwardly. Yep, that was definitely a hickey, all right.</p>
<p>"Oh that!" Sam exclaimed, waving it away. "I get that all the time."</p>
<p>Harrison regarded her skeptically. "You do?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, it comes and goes" Sam replied casually, wishing that Harrison would just drop the subject already. </p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I have no idea."</p>
<p>"You don't know what it is?"</p>
<p>"Not a clue. It's actually the first time I've ever had it on my neck. Sometimes I get them on my arms, my legs, my stomach, wherever. They come and go as they please, but they don't stay long." Sam rambled on, relieved as she sensed Harrison was believing her awful story.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should have it checked out?" Harrison asked, concerned. "Does it hurt when they appear?"</p>
<p>"Not at all." They're quite pleasurable actually, Sam thought with a smirk. "I think it's just some weird McPherson trait." She changed the subject quickly. "So, when are we eating? I'm starving!"</p>
<p>"You didn't have breakfast?"</p>
<p>"I woke up late and figured I'd save myself for lunch."</p>
<p>"Late night, huh?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I went to bed pretty early, I just couldn't fall asleep till much later."</p>
<p>"Weird marks and insomnia" Harrison commented as he made his way to the kitchen, Sam following close behind. "Something must be getting to you."</p>
<p><i>Yeah, Brooke McQueen...</i></p>
<p>Harrison glanced at her apologetically. "You're a little early, so everything's not entirely ready yet." </p>
<p>Sam shrugged, taking a seat at the table. "That's okay."</p>
<p>"I know how much you love Italian food" Harrison began as he sat beside her "so I made my mum's famous lasagna."</p>
<p>Sam stared at him, raising an eyebrow in response.</p>
<p>"Okay, my mum made her famous lasagna" Harrison announced grandly.</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "I thought so."</p>
<p>"I'll have you know, I helped her out!"</p>
<p>"By staying out of the way?"</p>
<p>Harrison glanced at her sheepishly. "You know me too well."</p>
<p>"Don't feel bad about your failings as a chef. My talent in the kitchen extends to boiling water, and even then, I stuff up." Harrison laughed. "Besides, I adore your mum's lasagna."</p>
<p>"Well she made more than enough."</p>
<p>"Great! Mind if I take some home? I'd love for Brooke to try it."</p>
<p>Harrison shrugged. "Sure. How's her shoulder doing by the way?"</p>
<p>"She's not very happy about it. It'll be several weeks before she gains full use of it."</p>
<p>"I won't ever forget her face" Harrison replied, sympathetically. "She looked like she was in so much pain."</p>
<p>"She was, I was surprised at how well she handled herself."</p>
<p>"You know, after you left for the hospital, everybody talked about how touching the entire scene was" Harrison admitted.</p>
<p>Sam frowned. "Brooke falling on her ass and dislocating her shoulder was touching?"</p>
<p>Harrison snickered. "No, the way you pushed through everybody to comfort her. I never thought I'd see the day. You holding Brooke in your arms, and actually not wanting to strangle her in the process."</p>
<p>Sam laughed, a touch uncomfortably. "Stranger things have happened."</p>
<p>"Not at Kennedy High, they haven't." Harrison joked. Standing up, he removed the lasagna from the oven and placed two large pieces on a plate. </p>
<p>"That smells so good" Sam complimented, her stomach rumbling.</p>
<p>Harrison grinned. "Wait a second, okay? I'm just going to set the table in the dining room." Sam stood up and began pacing once Harrison left, the warning bells in her head ringing louder and louder as each minute passed. Was Brooke right? Did Harrison want something more than friendship? She thought of the casual, but formal clothing he was wearing, the affectionate expression on his face whenever he looked at her, the way he hung onto every word she was saying. </p>
<p>She shook her head ruefully when she realised that this had been going on for some time. Now that she thought about it, Harrison wasn't too fond of Alex either. She closed her eyes and sent a quick prayer to whoever was listening, hoping that she was reading too much into the situation.</p>
<p>She turned around as Harrison walked back in, smiling hesitantly as he grabbed her hand. "Come on" He said softly, leading her out of the kitchen and into the dining room, where her eyes widened at the romantic scene in front of her. Noticing the soft music playing quietly in the background, her eyes finally settled on the large red roses situated in the middle of the table.</p>
<p>Brooke was right.</p>
<p>"Harrison, what is this?" She asked faintly, despite knowing exactly what it was.</p>
<p>He turned towards her and smiled. "I know how you feel about me and I want you to know that I feel the same way about you." He slowly leant forward, and Sam, realizing what he wanted to do, gently pushed him away, stepping back several feet to put distance between them. He moved forward once more, hesitating as Sam held her hand up.</p>
<p>"Don't, Harrison."</p>
<p>"Sam, I love you."</p>
<p>"No, you don't, not like this."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do" Harrison replied firmly. "Why are you resisting?"</p>
<p>Sam regarded him sadly. "I don't understand. You've loved Brooke for as long as I can remember. It was always Brooke this, and Brooke that. What changed?"</p>
<p>Harrison shrugged. "Brooke never felt the same way as I did"</p>
<p>"What? So I'm just a second prize, is that it?" Sam replied angrily. "You can't make it with Brooke, so lets just settle for good old dependable Sam, right?"</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant!"</p>
<p>"Then what do you mean, Harrison?"</p>
<p>"I was always dreaming for the one person I could never get, when the one person I wanted all along was right there beside me. Sam, you've been my best friend since forever, and I love you. Not Brooke. You" He stared at her, confused. "I imagined this moment a hundred times, why are you making it so difficult? I just told you I felt the same way, why are we arguing?"</p>
<p>"Harrison..."</p>
<p>He stepped forward. "What do I have to do to make you believe me?" </p>
<p>"You don't have to do anything, Harrison. I believe you." Sam answered softly.</p>
<p>"Then why are you looking at me like that?"</p>
<p>Sam regarded him sadly for several moments, and Harrison finally understood.</p>
<p>"You don't love me" He stated bluntly.</p>
<p>"I do love you..."</p>
<p>"Just not like that" Harrison finished, moving towards the table and slumping into his seat. He felt like someone had ripped his heart out and stomped on it. Sam walked over and sat down across from him. </p>
<p>"I am really sorry Harrison, I had no idea."</p>
<p>He glanced up momentarily and looked away. It hurt too much to see the pity in her eyes. "How could I have been so stupid!" he mumbled, angry at himself.</p>
<p>"You took a risk Harrison" Sam answered, gently. "There is nothing stupid about that. I don't blame you for trying." </p>
<p><i>Believe me, I understand.</i></p>
<p>"A risk? I didn't take any risk! Carmen and Lily told me that..." He stopped. He had never felt so humiliated in his life. He should have known that this was too good to be true.</p>
<p>"Carmen and Lily told you what?" Sam asked, frowning. </p>
<p>"That you felt for me what I felt for you." </p>
<p>Sam's jaw dropped. "What? Why would they say that?!"</p>
<p>"Why don't you go and ask them?"</p>
<p>"Harrison..."</p>
<p>"I want to be alone, okay?" He glanced at her before looking away once more. "Just go, Sam. Please."</p>
<p>Sam nodded silently, before she turned away and let herself out. </p>
<p>Hearing the door close behind her, Harrison picked up the crystal glass and threw it against the wall, not caring that his mum would have his head for breaking some of her best china.</p>
<p>Roughly rubbing at his eyes to stop the tears from falling, Harrison left the table and locked himself in his bedroom for the rest of the day.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Brooke looked up from the book she was reading, feeling a sense of deja vu as Sam once again stood quietly in her doorway, upset and teary eyed. Understanding immediately what had happened over at Harrison's, Brooke put her book away and held out her good arm, which Sam gratefully accepted, placing her head against Brooke's shoulder and huddling close against her warm body.</p>
<p>"You were right about Harrison" Sam finally explained.</p>
<p>"You need to stop having this affect on people, Sam" Brooke joked, her tone gentle as she rubbed Sam's back comfortingly. "The way things are going, you'll be explaining to Nicole that you're not interested in her."</p>
<p>"I mean, what is it?" Sam asked tearfully. "Is it the shampoo I use? The perfume I wear? Where is all this attention coming from?"</p>
<p>"Your irresistible gene has kicked in full force Sam, we mere mortals can't help worship at your feet" Brooke answered wryly, before turning serious. "Do you want to talk about what happened?"</p>
<p>"Not really" Sam replied, snuggling closer. "Later, okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure, whenever you're ready" Brooke replied, placing a soft kiss on her forehead.</p>
<p>"How did you spend your afternoon?" Sam asked, glancing up. "Please tell me it was better than mine."</p>
<p>"It wasn't too bad" Brooke replied. "I bummed around watching television, caught up with Nic over the phone, then came upstairs to read."</p>
<p>"Did you tell her about us?"</p>
<p>"No, I wanted to ask you first. Would you mind if I did?"</p>
<p>"I don't see why not" Sam replied, never believing she would live to see the day where she would trust Nicole with something so personal. "If you're sure she'll keep it to herself."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled. "I'm sure."</p>
<p>"I might have to tell Carmen and Lily about us as well."</p>
<p>Brooke glanced at her surprised. "So soon? Why?"</p>
<p>"They told Harrison that I was in love with him" Sam explained, still unable to figure out where they had gotten that crazy idea.</p>
<p>"What?!" Brooke asked, astonished. "Where the hell did they get that from?"</p>
<p>"Beats me! When I see them, I'm going to kick their ass" Sam replied, angrily.</p>
<p>"I'm sure they meant well Sam" Brooke responded, suddenly fearing for their lives.</p>
<p>"They could have talked to me first! You should have seen his face, Brooke!" Sam cried out, frustrated. "Things are just so screwed up, I don't want to lose Harrison, too."</p>
<p>"You've been friends for far too long, it's not going to happen" Brooke replied, soothingly. "Just give him time to deal with this. He'll come back to you."</p>
<p>"I'm glad one of us is the optimist in this relationship" Sam commented wryly. </p>
<p>Brooke laughed softly, before she continued. "I had an interesting conversation with your mother today."</p>
<p>"Interesting? I'm not going to like this "interesting" conversation am I?"</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "She loves the idea of you and Harrison as a couple."</p>
<p>Sam groaned. "Oh god."</p>
<p>"She thinks he gave you that hickey on your neck" Brooke continued.</p>
<p>"Things just keep on getting better and better" Sam replied, sarcastically. "You know, she was staring at me this morning and for the life of me I couldn't understand why. It wasn't until Harrison pointed it out that I realised why she was looking at me so strangely."</p>
<p>"Harrison saw it?" Brooke asked, surprised. "What did you say?"</p>
<p>"I denied it was a hickey and just said that I get marks like that all the time" Sam explained, a touch embarrassed.</p>
<p>Brooke regarded her stangely. "What? These so called marks just appear on your neck for no reason?"</p>
<p>Sam glanced at her sheepishly, well aware of how lame her explanation was. "Uh, yeah, and then they go away"</p>
<p>"These mysterious marks just go away? Wow, good one!" Brooke replied sarcastically, her amused smile taking away the harshness of her tone.</p>
<p>"Hey! I was surprised, I had to think fast" Sam said, defending herself.</p>
<p>"Well, you got the fast part right, not sure if you were thinking though" Brooke responded teasingly. Sam laughed, smacking her gently on the stomach before she turned serious. "We need to be more careful about this, okay?"</p>
<p>"It is agreed and it shall come to pass" Brooke replied playfully, lowering her voice a few octaves, wanting to cheer Sam up. The brunette smiled, regarding her silently for a moment. "I love seeing this side of you." </p>
<p>"Which is why I always ask that photos be shot from this angle" Brooke replied, gesturing to her right side.</p>
<p>"That's not what I mean" Sam responded, once she stopped laughing. "You can be very funny when you want to be. You're always making me laugh."</p>
<p>"That's because I love making you laugh" Brooke replied shyly, happily accepting Sam's kiss, her fingers running down her cheek once they parted. "I've been doing some thinking about us."</p>
<p>Sam sighed happily. "What about?"</p>
<p>"I always thought I fell in love with you after you came to live here" Brooke explained. "I didn't realise how wrong I was."</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?" Sam asked, warmed by Brooke's words.</p>
<p>"Do you remember when I got my tonsils out in first grade?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I do" Sam replied, recalling how upset she was, thinking she'd never see Brooke again. She paused for a moment, then looked up as the realisation struck her. "She told you, didn't she?"</p>
<p>"How you came home crying? Yes, she did." Brooke confirmed with a smile.</p>
<p>"How embarrassing." </p>
<p>"Don't be. That was one of the sweetest things I've ever heard."</p>
<p>Sam blushed. "Didn't I tell you it's always been you?"</p>
<p>Brooke smiled. "And that's what I'm trying to tell you. When your mum told me that story, I got to thinking of all the little things I did for you as a kid, despite our mutual dislike for each other. I never understood why I was doing the things I was doing, and as a child you're not going to analyze it to death. It all makes sense now."</p>
<p>"What stuff did you do, beside yell at me?"</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "Well, there was that time you lost your lunch money in fifth grade. When you weren't looking, I put my lunch money in your pencil case."</p>
<p>"That was you? I was wondering where the money came from" Sam replied, honestly surprised. "Harrison said that it was him!"</p>
<p>"He what? He told you that? That was me!" Brooke glared. "When he gets over today, remind me to smack him."</p>
<p>"You went hungry just for me?" Sam asked, moved by Brooke's admission.</p>
<p>"Not really" Brooke admitted sheepishly. "Some of the guys offered their lunch to me when they realised I didn't have any."</p>
<p>"Of course" Sam replied with a laugh. "So that was you all along. I even gave Harrison a kiss for that." Brooke raised an eyebrow in question. "On the cheek Brooke" Sam hastily amended with a smile.</p>
<p>"And where is my kiss for that truly sacrificing gesture?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, let me make it up to you." Leaning forward, Sam placed a chaste kiss on Brooke's cheek, laughing at the disappointed expression on her face. Once again covering Brooke's lips with her own, they parted after several minutes, the kiss leaving them both breathless. </p>
<p>"Is that better?" Sam asked, finally finding her voice, smirking as Brooke nodded wordlessly. Settling in Brooke's arms, Sam waited patiently for the blonde to continue. </p>
<p>"So, uh, anyway..." Brooke stopped for a moment, still affected by their kiss. "Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"What were we talking about again?"</p>
<p>Sam laughed. "You secretly gave me your lunch money.''</p>
<p>"Oh, right" Brooke nodded. "Let's see. Do you remember Billy?'</p>
<p>Sam gave her a look. "How could anyone forget Billy The Prick."</p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "Well, I punched him."</p>
<p>"What is it with you and punching people?" Sam asked in amusement. "Not that he didn't deserve it, mind you."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled sheepishly. "He was teasing you."</p>
<p>"Brooke, he teased everybody" Sam pointed out.</p>
<p>"Well, I didn't care for everybody, did I?" Brooke replied. "And then there was sixth grade Valentines Day. I gave everyone in my class a card just because I wanted to give you one. I didn't think too hard about why, I just thought it was because I wanted to stop the fighting between us."</p>
<p>"Well, it took a few more years for the card to work but we finally got there" Sam joked, making Brooke laugh. "I've still got it by the way. I went home and stared at it for ages."</p>
<p> Brooke shook her head ruefully. "How clueless are we?"</p>
<p>"I guess we're like Dawson and Joey" Sam replied. "Meant to be."</p>
<p>"I like that" Brooke responded happily. "Sam and Brooke, meant to be. It has a nice ring to it, don't you think?" </p>
<p>"Definitely" Sam confirmed with a grin.</p>
<p>"And Dawson sucks" Brooke continued. "Pacey and Joey are a way better couple."</p>
<p>"You'll get no argument from me" Sam stated.</p>
<p>"And I vote we stop talking" Brooke offered "because I really want to kiss you again."</p>
<p>"Now that is the best suggestion I've heard all day" Sam murmured, as Brooke drew her closer for another kiss.</p>
