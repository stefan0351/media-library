<!-- The Sentinel \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>Not only did Spike not knock when he entered Giles apartment
but he swung the doors open wide. "My, my, my what a wonderful night
it is!" Xander smirked at the vampire from his chair. "Lemme guess,
made time with the Dracie babes?" He smiled widely back at Xander.
"Made time? I didn't even have to stake them. The poor things got so
hot and bothered they turned to ash on their own." Suddenly another
voice spoke from off side. "Some how I doubt that." Spike turned and
grimaced at his sire, a grimace that turned into a smirk. "Well now,
you wouldn't know would you? I'd suspect that falls into the memories
of Angelus." Angel growled and stepped forward. "You wouldn't know
anything about that!" Spike smirked. "Maybe not, but I know one thing.
You're not human." He punctuated the statement with a short jab to
Angel's face.</p>

<p>He didn't get to follow up because Faith caught the arm before
it retracted and pinned it behind his back. She kept it behind his
back as she swept his legs out from underneath him and slammed him
face first into the floor. Angel seemed ready to start kicking his
childe while he was down when Buffy wrapped her arms around his chest
and pushed him back. "What's a matter sire? A little wound up that you
ruined your slayer for all other men?" "HEY!" At his words Faith
tightened her grip on Spike's arm and the bleach blond vampire growled
in pain. "Sorry luv, just a slip of the tongue." Faith tightened her
grip slightly and it showed on Spike's face. "You want to keep that
tongue you better keep a better hold on it. Now you think you've
learned your lesson?" "Yeah, wait till Angel and I are alone!" She
tightened her grip even further and he had to bite down a yell. "ALL
RIGHT, All right. I'll leave the poof alone. Just let me up!" She
seemed to consider for a moment, and then climbed off of him.</p>

<p>Spike got up rubbing his shoulder and glaring at his sire,
something that caused a rare grin to appear on Angel's face. "I bet
that hurt. Of course I bet not being able to fight back probably hurt
even worse. I mean I might not kill like I used to, but at least I
have a soul as an excuse." Spike growled and seemed ready to lunge
again when Faith stormed in close to Angel. "Look big guy! I can't
even begin to tell you how much you have done for me, and I love you
for it, but if you can't play nice I WILL drop you on your ass too!"
Angel seemed shocked at Faith's outburst while Spike grinned
triumphantly. As they all simmered down Giles stepped forward. "Now
that we have that out of our system, perhaps we should get down to the
matter at hand?" His fellow rogue watcher Wesley stepped forward.
"Quite right. Now, from what Faith told me over the phone we are
trying to free an ancient force of light that has been imprisoned by
the forces of darkness?"</p>

<p>Spike scoffed. "Well then, what the hell am I here for?" Buffy
answered that question. "I suggested it. I figured that if you knew
about the Judge you might know something about the Sentinel." He shook
his head. "The big blue bastard was Dru's idea. You'd have better luck
asking Nancy Boy over there." Angel growled as his childe again. Spike
refused to flinch and lit a cigarette. Giles seemed ready to say
something, but Spike noticed and the look he gave Giles showed it was
pointless. So the Englishman simply sighed as Angel started to speak.
"It's old. Older then me, even older then Darla. I think I heard the
Master speak of it once, but that was only because he was grateful
that it wouldn't be there to stop him from opening the Hellmouth."
Buffy sighed and ran her fingers through her hair. With out even
thinking about it Faith lightly touched Buffy's arm and the two girls
smiled at each other. </p>

<p>When they looked up they saw Angel had looked away while Spike
was grinning viciously. Guilt seemed to stab through the two
simultaneously, but Angel spoke before they could. "Don't ever feel
guilty for being happy." They both nodded sadly, and perhaps true to
form Cordelia broke the tension. "Ok Angel's gone from angry to
angsting. Now that things are back to normal we might want to get on
to freeing this gatekeeper guy." They all nodded and started to find
chairs in the rapidly filling apartment. Faith slid closer to the
well-built African American that had arrived with the rest of Angel
Investigations. "So you Gunn?" He nodded once. "Yeah." She smiled at
him. "Nice to see they finally have someone with a sense of style on
the payroll." He was smiling back as Cordelia let out an outraged
shriek. "Hey, what about me? I have more style then those three guys
put together!"  She smirked at the former cheerleader. "No Cordy, you
have fashion. Fashion is wearing what's in. Style is wearing whatever
you want, but making it look good."</p>

<p>She let out an injured huff as Xander spoke. "Um excuse me,
but maybe we could continue the House of Style AFTER we unchain
Prometheus?" Giles appeared shocked. "Xander, that's a classical
literature reference." He seemed to shrink down a bit. "Actually I saw
it on Xena." Giles let out a sigh. "Here is what we have so far. The
forces of light decided to send down a guardian to stand guard at the
mouth of Hell until the end of the world. The forces of darkness
learned of this and tried to stop him, but they learned that they
could not destroy him. So instead they imprisoned the Sentinel in a
giant block of obsidian." "Obsidian?" Everyone looked at Angel when he
made his surprised exclamation, and Giles was the one to speak. "Yes
Angel, obsidian. Do you know something about it?" "I've seen it." All
eyes focused on him as he spoke. </p>

<p>"In the crypts underneath Wolfram and Heart." Faith was the
one to ask the Question the Scoobies all wanted to ask. "You mean the
guys who blew up your old offices?" All of Angel Investigations nodded
the affirmative. Xander asked another question. "So, what's the deal
with Wolfram and Heart?" Cordelia looked at her old boyfriend. "Well
Xander, you know all the jokes about evil lawyers? They aren't jokes
when it comes to Wolfram and Heart." Buffy moved closer to her
ex-boyfriend. "Do you think it's still there?" He nodded. "It should
be. I mean it was huge. Not the kind of thing you move very often, and
by the spells they had lain on it I don't think they would want to
move it at all." In a rare bit of assertiveness Tara then spoke up.
"Do you remember what kind of spells they were?" Angel shook his head.
"Not exactly, but they seemed protective, and they looked like they
were trying to keep something in, instead of something out."</p>

<p>Willow put her hand on her partner's knee and it caused Tara
to look at her. "You think it's trying to escape?" Tara nodded, though
it was more a gentle dipping of her head. "It might explain the powers
that be sending Cordelia's vision, and they might have even led
Dracula to Buffy." Both slayers seemed offended at the idea, but chose
to remain silent, Willow however did not. "So if we broke the spells..."
Tara finished her sentence. "It could break free on it's own." Both of
the Wiccan's smiled at each other until Gunn decided to add some
reality to the situation. "Well, this seems real important to all of
ya, and since Angel's footin the bill I'll help, but hasn't anyone
else noticed all the "ifs"?" The rest of them nodded slowly as Wesley
then spoke. "We need more information." Spike then stood up. "Well,
well, best of luck with the great escape, or big heist or whatever
else you end up doing."</p>

<p>Faith stood up right after him. "You? Nah uh Spike. We." Spike
held up his hands and shook his head. "Oh no. I was happy to help you
track down my own rogue brat, and Drac... well like I said he owed me
money, but there's no way I'm going to help you lock up the
Hellmouth." Before Faith could reply Buffy stood up and walked to
close to Spike. "But you helped me keep it shut before." He shook his
head. "I helped you waste my sire, and I'll help you again if that's
what you had in mind." Angel seemed ready to reply but Faith motioned
him to stay silent as Buffy continued. "We both know it was more then
that. You said you liked this world." "That was before it shoved a
damn microchip in my head to keep me from killing humans." Angel did
speak then, grinning evilly as he did so. "Well then you'll be coming
with us either way. Sitting up front, or riding in the trunk." </p>

<p>Spike growled as he spoke. "Fine, but we better stop along the
way, I need some fresh fags." Gunn seemed shocked and Faith bit her
lip to keep from laughing. "He's British." "Ohhhhhhh, and in England a
fag is a cig, I get ya." Spike lit up a fresh one as he glared at
Gunn. "Sorry junior, your not my type." Angel again went to stick a
barb in his childe's side. "No one's your type anymore now are they?"
Spike blew a cloud of smoke in his sire's direction. "Yeah, but not by
choice. Not just because I'm some sort of sissy." Before it could
escalate Buffy stepped in.  "Well I think if we want more information
on a LA law firm we need to go to LA. So who's up for a road trip?"
The Scoobies that had once known Wesley Wyndam Pryce seemed shocked at
the clear confident tone. "Buffy's right, from what we already know
about Wolfram and Heart anything they want imprisoned or destroyed is
probably a potent force for good, and we can't learn anything here in
Sunnydale." </p>

<p>They all agreed with that and started shuffling out of Giles
apartment. Angel was the one who spoke as the rest of his team climbed
into his convertible. He handed Buffy a card. "It has our new address
on there. We'll go and get things started." Buffy nodded, and then as
Angel turned to leave she spoke. "Angel, wait!" He seemed confused,
but he turned back around. She arched up and kissed his cheek,
whispering in his ear as she did so. "I really am happy." He smiled at
that. "I'm glad." The former lovers shared a look and then Angel went
down to the drivers seat and started the engine. As the car pulled
away Buffy felt a familiar set of arms wrap around her from behind. As
a soft set of lips kissed the top of her head Buffy sighed. "I know B,
I'm hurting for him too." The two slayers sighed in unison as Xander
cleared his throat. As the Scoobies looked him he spoke to Giles.
"See, you just have to do it right." Giles gave the young man a harsh
look as he started to speak. </p>

<p>"Well, while Giles has his flashy new wheels we still have
twice as many people as we should." They all seemed to consider that
until Faith spoke to Buffy. "Your mom?" "My mom?" Faith shrugged.
"Well, after your coming out you told her ALL about being a slayer. So
while she may not be in the thick of things I have to think that makes
her like the slayer reserve." Buffy shook her head. "No, her car, ok,
but they don't make liability insurance for moms. Giles, you, Xander,
Willow, and Anya get your stuff. Faith, Spike and I will get the car
from mom. Meet at the mansion in two hours." They all nodded as Giles
went inside to quickly pack books with Tara and Willow helping him
while Xander and Anya walked off to go to his parent's basement.</p>

<p>"Ok, I'll pack a few things and we will be on our way." Buffy
shook her head emphatically. "No, we need a car, not a driver." "I
don't know, I've seen you drive." Joyce Summers shared a smile with
her daughter's girlfriend who was already smiling. "But there'll be
danger, big, hairy, fanged, clawed danger." Joyce nodded. "All the
more reason for you to have a good driver to get you away from all
that danger. We'll even stay at your fathers. I will keep him off of
your back." Buffy shook her head, but gently. "No, we'll be staying at
Angel's he said his new place is big enough." Joyce started walking to
her bedroom. "That's great. I'd love to see it." Buffy let out a
muffled shriek and then glared at her girlfriend. "And would YOU stop
encouraging her?" Faith held up her hands and tried to look shocked.</p>

<p>Buffy managed to catch up with her mother as she was getting
out a suitcase. "What about Dawn?" With those words her mother stopped
short. "I didn't think of that. You might have to fight demons, but we
can't expose your sister to that." Dawn had heard them as they passed
where she was staring wide-eyed at Spike as the vampire was pointedly
ignoring her. "It's ok. I can spend a few days by myself." Her mother
and sister looked up with similar expressions, and actually spoke in
unison. "Oh no you can't." Faith laughed at that, and Dawn's sorrowful
face. "Sorry kid, but Xander's coming with us anyways." Dawn gave
Faith a pleading look that was missed by both of the elder Summers
women. Joyce seemed to miss it because she was coming to a decision,
and it caused her to sigh. "I can't come with, but I also can't be
with out the car." They both seemed caught up in that as Faith spoke
up. "There's always Spike's car."  He seemed to hear that from where
he was sitting in the living room. "Fine! But I'm driving!" </p>

<p>Buffy's shoulders slumped. "Spike's car it is. By the way... why
does Dawn let you call her kid? She HATES it when anyone else does."
Dawn answered as Faith exaggerated her grin. "That's because there was
obviously a slayer mix-up and Faith was supposed to be my sister while
you were just supposed to be her girlfriend." Buffy just shook her
head at her younger sister, and over her younger sister's puffed up
shoulders at her still smirking girlfriend. As they all walked to the
living room Buffy whispered to Faith. "Reformed or not, you are still
a trouble maker." "Not to worry B. I have you to keep me on the
straight and narrow... well on the narrow anyway." Buffy shook her head,
but playfully as she sped up her pace. Both slayers were still
smiling, and when they got to the living room they found Spike smiling
as well. "So ladies will I be your chauffeur?" </p>

<p>They both nodded and he got up and offered an arm to each
lady. Faith was the one to comment. "Your mood seems to have
improved." He smiled broadly at her as she took his arm. "I've just
been thinking of potential "accidents" that might happen to Angel. I
mean it IS a dangerous situation we will be getting into." Buffy
strode up and grabbed his other arm rather forcefully and his smile
grew. "Don't worry pet. I said I was just thinking of them." The
smaller slayer began pulling him out of the door as Faith spoke over
her shoulder. "Love ya ... mom, Dawn." Joyce smiled at that, and then
Buffy spoke. "Love you guys." First Joyce responded. "Love you too."
When Dawn didn't reply she nudged her youngest. "Yeah, try not to get
Faith hurt." As they got out of the door Spike spoke. "Ah, reminds me
of my family, and why I'm glad they are all long dead. Right. Meet you
two at the mansion?" The slayer's nodded as the vampire took off
towards his lair in the ruins of the Initiative.</p>
