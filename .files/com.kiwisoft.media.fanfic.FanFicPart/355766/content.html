<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Four -->

<p>After an exhausting day, Lacy laid her dozing son on the bed. Leaning down she kissed him goodnight on the cheek. Derek desperately fought the onset of sleep when he again called. "Jage. Want Jage."</p>
		<p>"Honey, Gage isn't here. We'll get to see her tomorrow, okay?" His disappointment carved a frown on his face. Lacy tucked him in securely, dropping closer, she softly sang to him lulling him into a deep reluctant slumber. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Dani watched with dismay. Her brother had been asking for the stranger all night long.
			<i>I'm going to have to get to the bottom of this. </i>She continued to ponder why Derek was so attracted to the stranger and didn't notice her mother move up next to her.
		</p>
		<p>"Dani, come on. It's your turn." She nudged her daughter from her musings. "Did you brush your teeth?"</p>
		<p>She decided to address the issue directly. "Mom, why do you think Derek likes that..... stranger?" A menacing tone accompanied the last word spoken. </p>
		<p>Lacy directed Dani to her twin bed as she sat down beside her daughter. "What's with you today, Dani? Any other time, you're the one who's so open to..... strangers." Mimicking her daughter's tone. </p>
		<p>The young girl crunched her face at the mother's true words. "I don't know." Dani intended to drop the subject, but the following words spilled out softly before she could stop herself. "Derek used to just like us."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Recognizing the source of her daughter's problem, Lacy stroked Dani's face lightly. "He still does. And you are the most important person in his life. He adores you, you know."</p>
		<p>Brightly, Dani agreed. "He does, doesn't he?" Adding, "You too, mom. He loves you the most." Then after some thought, she continued. "And dad, right?"</p>
		<p>"Absolutely." Lacy smiled. "I'm very lucky to have both of you." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The astute child noticed her mother did not include her father. "And dad too?" An insistent tone questioned.</p>
		<p>Lacy briefly allowed a far away thought to capture her attention. The slight nudge of an arm retrieved her thoughts back to the present. "And dad, too." She assured her daughter. "Now, it's time for you to get into bed. And, Dani?" Blue eyes piqued at her mother's question. "Tomorrow, would you please give Gage a chance? She did save your brother from getting hurt. Okay?"</p>
		<p>Dani nodded. But, in her mind, Derek would never have jumped from that hill unless he was sucked into it.
			<i>I'll give her a chance. </i>A devious smile crossed her face.
			<i>A chance to slip up.</i>
		</p>
		<i>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Dani was about to climb under the covers when they heard a knock at the door. "Stay here." Lacy directed her daughter. Unable to comply simply due to her ever-present curiosity and protective nature toward her mother, Dani covertly followed Lacy out the bedroom door down the short hall where she took up a concealed position. </p>
		<p>She watched her mother complete the journey to the front entryway. Standing safely behind the locked door, Lacy called out. "Who is it?"</p>
		<p>"Ah, Mrs. Levine? It's Ned Raye." A friendly voice wafted through the three paned-covered glass door. "My mom dropped you off earlier. She wanted me to stop by and see if you're okay."</p>
		<p>Lacy was hesitant when she heard. "Can I come in?" Grasping the doorknob, she opened the door. A young good-looking boy around seventeen stood smiling at the prospect of meeting his favorite actress of all time.</p>
		<p>"Hi." Ned waved, then immediately noticed Lacy's blue eyes become aware of the guy behind him. Gesturing quickly to his friend. "Oh, this is Buddy Dunston."</p>
		<p>Buddy leaned forward extending his hand. "It's nice to meet you."</p>
		<p>"You too." Lacy was impressed with his good manners, letting go of his reluctant hand; she directed her question to Ned. "I thought your mom said you'd stop by in a day or two."</p>
		<p>"Oh, she did." Ned grabbed her hand, shaking it. He was already unhappy that Buddy seized the opportunity to touch the famous star first. "But, I've..." Buddy bumped him. "We've got an errand to run tomorrow out of town so we wouldn't be able to stop by." Ned smiled broadly as he offered his explanation.</p>
		<p>"I see." Lacy suspected that wasn't the real reason, taking in the leering looks on their faces. She ascertained it was more likely they couldn't wait to meet a real live television star. "Well, my husband should be here by the end of the week." She noticed their crestfallen faces. "I think we have everything we'll need until he gets here. And, besides, we have a boat trip planned for tomorrow with our neighbor in the next cabin. So, we'll be fine. Thanks. " Neither boy budged. "Although, if I do, I'll be sure to call."</p>
		<p>Both the young men perked up at that comment. "Cool." Ned pushed Buddy further from the door toward his mother's station wagon. "Bye." He waved, missing the first step off the porch. He caught himself before hitting the ground. Buddy snickered at his friend.</p>
		<p>Closing the door, Lacy twisted around noticing her oldest child at her stakeout post near the end of the hallway. "Everything okay?"</p>
		<p>"I was just going to ask you that." Dani countered. "What did they want?"</p>
		<p>She scooted her daughter down the hallway back to bed. "You tell me, I'm sure you heard every word." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The quick wink Lacy offered her daughter assured Dani she wasn't in trouble though she had formulated a different opinion of the two unwelcome late night guests. "I don't like them."
			<i>They're trouble, </i>she added silently.
		</p>
		<p>Tucking her daughter in, Lacy sat back on the bed. "Now, why does that not surprise me? You haven't liked anyone today."</p>
		<p>"Not true, I liked Grace." Diverting her mother's attention. "Do you think she's seen her new grandbaby yet?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. And don't think I didn't notice you change the subject, my little suspicious daughter."</p>
		<p>Dani decided not to share her reservations about the landlord's son and his friend. She figured her mother would not be as receptive as she usually was in these types of situations.
			<i>Must be because she's on vacation, </i>Dani concluded. Lacy was always concerned about the safety of her children ever since she'd become well-known, realizing the potential danger her children could be in due to her public persona.
		</p>
		<p>After kissing her daughter goodnight, Lacy flipped the light switch allowing darkness to fall. As Lacy checked the cabin's doors, she entertained the concerns her daughter had raised about the people they had met that day. Lacy first realized about a year ago Dani had developed a kind of sixth sense about people and decided not to dismiss her daughter's qualms. She pondered the day's events before Lacy allowed her mind to drift to the blonde haired woman in the cabin across the way.</p>
		<p>Lying in bed, Lacy stretched her long frame burying herself in the covers. The cool night air chilled the cabin. She had forgotten to adjust the thermostat earlier in the evening upon getting lost in the process of settling in for a month's stay. The last waking thought that ran through her head was of Gage's lingering green eyes that bled into her dreams. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Shutting off her laptop computer, Gage completed the final scene of her new screenplay, HERE COMES JORDAN.
			<i>Five weeks and presto, I've churned out another blockbuster.
			</i>Gage laughed out loud at her egotistical thought. "I'll be lucky if Mark likes it."
		</p>

		<p>Then her thoughts turned to the extraordinarily talented actress she'd met earlier.
			<i>I wonder if she'd like it. I could let her read it. </i>"Yeah, sure. Tomorrow I'll just mention it casually and see if she wants to read it."
			<i>No! What if she doesn't like it? And she'd feel obligated to say something nice if I did ask her to read it. </i>
		</p>
		<i>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
		</i>
		<p>
			Gage picked up the draft copy of the screenplay from the printer, clamping it together.
			<i>Maybe I'll invite her and her kids back here after the boat ride and leave it out....laying..... </i>Gage searched for the most obvious place available
			<i>....right there. </i>Sitting it down then quickly retrieving it, she opened her leather satchel and shoved it in.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>That settled Gage went about getting ready for bed. Burying herself under the covers as she laid in the huge bed, Gage chuckled at the audacity Derek had shown when he leaped off that ledge. Right before he jumped, she recognized something in his eyes that roared loudly the conviction he had in her that she would catch him. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>That kind of blind faith shook Gage to the core. No one ever expressed such belief in her before except, of course, for Mark. And, she felt she didn't deserve his unwavering devotion.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A trip down memory lane offered Gage a moment to ponder her relationship with Mark. When Gage opened the letter from the America's Best Writing competition, the words
			<i>?Thank you for entering our competition, but</i>....' leaped off the page at her. She tossed it aside to keep company with the numerous other rejection letters making their way quickly to the ceiling. Gage came up with a saying of sorts to help her handle these types of letters.
			<i>I use rejections as stepping-stones on my way to success. </i>
		</p>
		<p>So it shocked her when she answered the telephone the next week and someone she had never met was offering to buy her first screenplay, A QUESTION OF MURDER. Within two weeks, Gage and Mark had hammered out a deal to produce her screenplay. To Gage's delight, Mark revealed his long desire to start his own production company, asking her to join him in his new venture. </p>
		<p>Even with the success of two murder/mystery books to her credit, Gage longed to write and produce screenplays. So she jumped at the chance into the symbolic arms of her knight in shining armor. Not unlike what the little boy had done earlier in the day with her.</p>
		<p>Mark and Gage quickly became friends after discovering both had experienced difficult times during their lives. Each had suffered great losses, Mark lost his wife and parents in an airplane accident and Gage never even got to know that kind of family relationship in her life.</p>
		<p>These thoughts led to another family across the way.
			<i>I bet they're all sleeping right now. </i>The love mother had for son and vice versa permeated the air when Lacy encased her little daredevil in her arms. Gage smiled in contemplation briefly only to find her thoughts going along another path in wonder about the young girl who exhibited a distinct reservation toward her.
			<i>I've got to do something about that.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>She didn't know why it was so important to her that this family like her, but Gage determined to do just that. The niggling feeling that pestered her thoughts demanded it, and it declared loudly with a thundering roar that her life would never reach true happiness if she failed. </p>
