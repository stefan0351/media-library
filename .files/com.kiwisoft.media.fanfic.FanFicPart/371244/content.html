<p>"Ugh, make it stop," the brunette whined, bringing her hands to her ears. "It's been crying all day."</p>
<p>"She's not an 'it'; her name is Miley," the other girl corrected as she rocked the baby reassuring it as if it's been offended, bringing the crying to a stop.</p>
<p>"Lilly, it's a <i>doll</i>!" Miley held her hands out at the common knowledge. "And I still can't believe you named it after me."</p>
<p>"But I love your name," she complimented causing the other girl to blush. "Besides, you know this is our <i>final.</i> We have to pass this class to <i>graduate.</i>" Miley let out a sigh and walked over to her bed, plopping down next to Lilly. "Hey, be careful. She's sleeping."</p>
<p>Miley rolled her eyes. "Sorry," she deadpanned. "Why do we even have to take care of a baby anyways? It's not like we're gonna need the practice before nine months is up or anything." <i>God, this is pointless.</i></p>
<p>"It's to make us not want to get pregnant and show us how much responsibility it takes to care for a child," she announced superciliously. <i><b>Maybe if you paid attention in class you'd know.</b></i></p>
<p>Lilly was right. The two girls were given a computerized baby as their final in their Personal Growth and Development class to take care of it all day for the next week. It seemed simple enough, but there was only one problem: the two had to get above a 70% to pass, but if they failed, they would have to say bye-bye to this year's graduation.</p>
<p>"But I don't wanna take care of it. It's creepy. I mean, look at the way it just <i>stares</i>. It's like it's peering into our souls." She whispered eerily. "They should have made it close it's eyes when it sleeps." Lilly looked up from the baby, giving Miley an 'are you serious right now?' stare. "You can't deny it. That thing gives me the creeps! I'm not touchin' it." She open-handedly held her hands up.</p>
<p>"You don't have to. You'd probably just make it cry anyways." Lilly stuck her tongue out at the other girl.</p>
<p>"Would not! But still, this stupid thing ruined everything. Now I can't even go to Jake's party tonight when Daddy's gone. How am I supposed to get any alone time with Jake if I'm here taking care of that damn thing." Miley said crossing her arms.</p>
<p>"Her name is <i>Miley</i>. I'm not telling you again." Miley cringed at Lilly's low, serious tone. <i><b>Why can't she get just I don't want her to go?</b></i></p>
<p>"Ok, sorry." <i>Why does she even care what I call it?</i></p>
<p>Lilly let out a remorseful sigh. "I cant' believe I'm doing this, but.. I'll stay here while you go to the party tonight." She said reluctantly. "I know you don't get to go to a lot of high school ones with all the Hannah concerts and stuff so enjoy it tonight." She said agitatedly. Miley couldn't believe her ears.</p>
<p>"Really? Oh, Lilly, you're the best!" She ran over to her friend with her arms open and was about to give her a big hug before seeing Lilly still had the baby in her arms. She stopped dead in her tracks right in front of Lilly, kissing her cheek and lightly pulling her into a soft hug instead. The blonde's cheeks flared red at the kiss. "Thank you." She whispered into her ear and thought she heard a slight moan come from Lilly but pushed the thought away.</p>
<p>Miley pulled back and smiled at her friend's red cheeks. "Well, I'm gonna go get a drink. Want anything?" She said as she walked towards the door.</p>
<p>"Water please." Miley noticed her friend's sweet voice was back again, meaning she was no longer angry. "Oh and Miley?" She popped her head back into the doorway. "I-I'm sorry I kinda got mad." The blonde said, looking to the floor.</p>
<p>Miley couldn't help but smile. She knew Lilly wasn't the best at apologies and every time she did she would look to the floor or fidget with something. The blush on the blonde's face always made Miley's heart beat a little faster. She loved when Lilly blushed; it showed her softer side, the side Miley wanted to bring out.</p>
<p>"It's ok. I'm sorry too." Lilly brought her eyes to Miley's and smiled. Miley's heart quickened when she noticed how soft and caring Lilly's eyes looked, sending her heart into frenzy. She hurriedly walked into the kitchen and was greeted by Robby Ray.</p>
<p>"Hey Darlin'. How's that baby comin' along?" He asked as he made himself a sandwich.</p>
<p>"Terrible. That stupid thing is taking up every second of my life. Thank goodness I'm paired with Lilly."</p>
<p>He let out a small laugh. "It's only been two days and you better not leave that poor girl with the baby for two long."</p>
<p>"Yea, two days of our vacation already wasted. It's not fair that they gave us the baby during out spring break. It ruins all my plans!"</p>
<p>"You didn't have any plans," he deadpanned, shutting Miley up quick.</p>
<p>"Yea, well, Lilly likes taking care of the plastic thing for some forsaken reason. I have no idea how you and Mom raised Jackson and me when we were babies or even wanted to for that matter. Gosh, they're helpless and just so.. needy!"</p>
<p>He walked over to his daughter and put his hand on her shoulder. "That's what the parents are there for. Ya' see, you're mother always did most the work. For some reason, I could never get either of you to shut- uh, I mean, quiet down." Miley scoffed at this.</p>
<p>"Anyways, what I mean is that babies always need their parents to be there for them. Even at the smallest cry your mother would rush up to you both and try her best to comfort ya'll. Don't get me wrong, there were times she just let you guys cry and cry until you cried yourself to sleep." He laughed at the memory. Miley glared at her father with her arms crossed and he cleared his throat.</p>
<p>"I guess my point is that it really takes a lot out of a person to care for a child, especially alone. But you could always tell how much love someone has for another by the way they look at a person. It just shows in their eyes."</p>
<p>Miley let her arms down at this and let her father's words soak in. "Anyways, enough of me ramblin', don't wanna keep this sandwich waitin'." He patted his daughter's back before heading off the couch to eat and watch some t.v., but Miley stood there for a little longer thinking about what Robby had said.</p>
<p>She pushed the thought away and got a couple water bottles from the fridge before running back up the stairs. She rolled her eyes when she heard the baby begin to cry again thinking again about how the baby almost ruined her weekend plans, leaving her scoffing at the thought of it. Before she reached the door, a soft voice filled her ears. It was Lilly, and she was singing. She remembered the teacher saying something about playing soft music to calm the child, but she didn't know if singing would do the trick instead.</p>
<p>To Miley's surprise, the crying began quieting. Miley sneaked into the room not wanting to disturb the motherly figure on her bed. She had never heard her friend sing so gently. A wave of peace and serenity swept over her clearing her of all previous frustrating thoughts. The unknown Miley was mesmerized as she just stood in the doorway listening to the soft voice flowing around the room; her heart pace quickening with every soft word.</p>
<p>The blonde looked up to be frightened by her quiet friend. "Jeez, Miley make a noise why don't you."</p>
<p>Her voice bringing Miley out of her daze, "Sorry. It's just.. wow." Lilly gave her a questioning look. "I didn't know you could sing like that. Why don't you sing more often? Honestly, I'm jealous." She asked handing Lilly her water. <i>Why won't my heart stop racing?</i></p>
<p>A laugh escaped Lilly's lips. "Well, I'm honored that the great Hannah Montana thinks I could sing, but I think you're giving me too much credit. It was nothing." Lilly honestly didn't think she had a good voice. She never really sang in front of people to have them give her their opinion. Miley was about to object when Lilly's phone vibrated.</p>
<p>"Hello?" Lilly whispered trying to keep from waking the plastic child. "Okay… yea… alright. Bye."</p>
<p>"Your mom?" Miley asked feeling a bit more calm.</p>
<p>"Yea, just calling to say she's going out tonight and won't be back before I get home. It's strange; she's going out a lot lately. Wonder if she's got a secret boyfriend or something." Lilly shrugged and stood. Walking to Miley's desk, "it says tonight's your night to take care of her but since tonight's your "big party" you'll be making up for it by taking her for the <i>entire</i> day tomorrow." Miley's mouth opened to object, but Lilly cut her off. "What? Did you think I was just gonna let you off the hook without getting something in return? I thought you knew Lilly better than that."</p>
<p>With a sigh Miley agreed. "Fine. Well, let me get ready and then I'll drive you home on my way there."</p>
<p>"It's okay. I'll just walk. We do live like 5 minutes away from each other remember? It's in the opposite direction of Jake's anyways. And besides, I wanna get home before the sun rises." Lilly teased insinuating Miley takes hours to get ready.</p>
<p>"Oh yea, Miss '3 hours and 24 minutes.'" Miley retorted.</p>
<p>"Hey, that was one time and I had to look perfect."</p>
<p>"Perfect for what? It was just my birthday party." Miley mentioned.</p>
<p>"Yea but.." <i><b>Should I say it? </b></i>"I wanted to look perfect for you." Lilly said shyly causing Miley to turn a dark shade of red.</p>
<p>"Well, you did look really hot." Lilly smiled feeling pleased she said it. "Anyways, I'll be quick, promise."</p>
