<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>Kelsey was up at the crack of dawn, packed and ready to get onboard and get settled. She knew the ship orientation by heart, but it was mandatory for all officers to attend. <i>'Yipee!'</i> she thought glumly and headed down to the lobby to find a newspaper and a cup of coffee to kill some time.</p>
		<p>Alyssa heard music playing in the background and rolled over and fell back asleep. It wasn't until the phone rang that she jumped up awake, it was her wake up call from the front desk. She had used it as a backup in case she failed to wake up to the alarm in the room. She quickly hung up the phone and ran for the shower, grateful that she had the presence of mind to call the desk or she would still be sleeping as the ship pulled out of the harbor. Getting up early had never been a favorite past time for Alyssa, who liked to sleep as late as possible in the mornings. But, she knew that those days were long gone with this new job. She would be on a rotating schedule of shifts. The Purser's Desk was to be manned from 5 am to 9 PM every day, seven days a week. Being new woman on the totem pole, so to speak, she had a feeling she would be pulling a lot of early morning shifts.</p>
		<p>Alyssa caught the second employee bus pickup to the cruise ship and stumbled on board with the rest of the arriving crew. All her things had been previously sent to the ship except for her overnight bag, which she carried. As she waited on the dock to board the ship she rummaged through her bag for her ID<i>. </i>Each ID listed, beneath their photo, their name, rank and country of citizenship.<i> 'Photo ID must be worn by all employees at all times, and must be carried on their person even off duty.' </i>Her mind quoting what she had read from the Employee Handbook. Placing the chain around her neck, the ID badge hung to almost her waist. Frowning, she let it go. Enough time later to worry about the small stuff. When it was her turn to board, she showed her ID and her paperwork and was directed toward her cabin. She had never been on a cruise ship before and she could feel the excitement building as she walked down the passageway looking for her cabin number. She knew that officers received better quarters than other employees, but usually cabins that the paying customer wouldn't want. Either they were too small, or too out of the way. Alyssa was surprised to find that she had to go up two decks to find her cabin. She didn't think that the crew were actually bunked above the level she was currently on and hoped that it wasn't a mistake. Now, was not the time to be running around trying to find her cabin, orientation was in 30 min. and she had wanted to be early to make sure she got a good seat. She hadn't realized how long it would take to go through the boarding process or that there were this many employees on a cruise ship. This was a whole new world for Alyssa and she was constantly amazed at what she didn't know.</p>
		<p>Kelsey made her way forward on the Promenade Deck and was happy to see that she had gotten one of the better officer cabins. She wondered if she had Sandy to thank for this and if she shouldn't give in and go to dinner her just once. Cringing at the thought, she figured she would just enjoy her good fortune while it lasted and take the bad with the good later. Entering the cabin, Kelsey chose the bed farthest away from the door, remember past nightmares with roommates that came in all hours of the night, usually drunk and falling on the nearest bed, hers. She would not only be jarred awake, but she would have to get up and put her roommates to bed, before getting back in her own and trying to fall back asleep while they snored in their liquor induced comas. Nope, this time she was taking the rack by the window and going to get some sleep at night! Their gear was all sitting outside the door and she went and pulled her familiar duffel bags into the room and began the task of unpacking. She wondered who her roommate would be this year and hoped it wasn't some starry-eyed newbie that thought every night was made for a new conquest. The only rule that Kelsey loved about the Cruise line was that no opposite sexes were allowed in employee's cabins. Kelsey smiled glad that she wouldn't have to put up with the new recruits bringing home a new man every night. Only with one roommate had Kelsey closed her eyes to the infraction and allowed her to bring a man to the cabin. It was one of the few friends' that Kelsey had ever made on her voyages. Carol and her husband were fresh out of college and both on working the season to save money to get their own home. Carol and Kelsey had set up a schedule where three nights a week Kelsey wouldn't come back to the room until midnight. On those nights, Kelsey spent a lot of time hanging out in the employee lounge and other creative places while she waited until she could get back into their room. Her favorite place was on a deck chair in the front of the ship where no one usually went. She could look up at the stars as the evening breezes washed over her body. It was the nearest she ever came to feeling at peace in her entire life. With the billions of stars above her and the gentle caress of the wind, she felt she wasn't alone. Kelsey had many relationships in her lifetime, but none had ever made her feel that way, which is probably why she had given up searching for someone to complete her world. Now at 33, she just did what she had to, to live and left the foolish ideas of romance to the youth. Kelsey felt a presence at the door and turned to face to face with her new roommate, a quick spark tingled her heart and startled her, instantly jolting her out of her revere. This sudden uncertainty allowed her to shut down all emotions and inwardly she groaned, <i>"Oh great! Babysitting detail!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa stood looking from the paper in her hand to the number of the door and then back to the tall raven-haired woman that stood in her cabin. <i>'No, please tell me this isn't happening! Tell me, that I'm not going to spend the next year of my life with 'happy' here!' </i>The two women stood looking at each other with neither one making the first attempt to break the silence. Finally, Alyssa cleared her throat and asked, "Promenade B4?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"I think this is my cabin." Alyssa replied uncertainly, afraid to enter the room and not sure of what to do otherwise.</p>
		<p>Kelsey's patience did not seem to be at it's best today and her reply was anything but cordial. "Are those your bags in the corridor?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa looked down at her things next to the door and nodded without speaking.</p>
		<p>"Well, then I guess you in the right place." Kelsey replied flippantly and finished her packing. She silently kicked herself for her behavior and didn't look at the blonde and she struggled to pull her things into the room and stood looking around unsure of herself. </p>
		<p>Kelsey turned to face the woman and maintained her composure to calmly instruct her new roommate. "That bed is yours and this dresser and the closet on the right behind you. You need to hurry and unpack as ship orientation is in 20 minutes in the ODR." Not waiting for a response from the blonde, KELSEY walked past her and out the door and headed down to the briefing wondering what it was about the woman that made her act so stupidly.</p>
		<p>Alyssa sat down on the edge of her assigned bed and felt a rise of panic well up in her. Taking a deep breath, she got herself under control and let her anger take over. Getting up she yanked her suitcase upon the bed and began to pull out her things and shove them into drawers. Opening up the closet, she noticed her new uniforms and placed the few other dressy items that she had brought next to them on the hangers. Finished, she shoved her suitcases under her bed and looked at her watch. She had 5 minutes to get to the Officer's Dining Room for orientation. Hesitating at her dress, she remembered that her roommate hadn't changed into her uniform either and grabbed what she assumed was her cabin key off the dress and went in search of where she needed to be. She finally found a stream of people heading and one direction and tagged along, hoping they knew where they were going. Arriving at the orientation, ALYSSA took a seat in the back next to a group of women who seemed friendly enough and introduced themselves. They were all from one department and worked the various lounges. ALYSSA was glad that she seemed to find some friendly faces and possible future friends and looked around the room to find her roommate sitting up near the front talking to a group of people who all looked as equally tanned and fit as she did. She began to wonder what exactly their assignments were.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm...honey, don't even bother there, nothing but ice." Alyssa turned to face the accented voice that she heard next to her. The woman's bade said that her name was Karen and she was from England.</p>
		<p>"What?"</p>
		<p>Karen pointed toward Alyssa's roommate. "Kelsey. Yeah, she is gorgeous, but a dead end for sure. Now Terri, the brunette next to her, she is really a nice yank!" Karen winked and smiled at Alyssa.</p>
		<p>Flushed and embarrassed Alyssa stammered, "No, you don't understand....she's my roommate."</p>
		<p>"KELSEY?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa nodded to the woman. "You are one lucky yank!" Karen patted her on the arm proudly and turned to tell the group of her new discovery. All the women laughing and congratulating Alyssa, which made her feel very uncomfortable. She wasn't sure what she had expected, but certainly not this, she had expected there to be some gay women on the cruise, but not everyone she met! <i>'This is too funny!'</i> Alyssa thought smiling and looked back over at Kelsey and saw that she was looking directly at her with a very unhappy look on her face. Alyssa quickly lost the smile and looked away as the speaker approached the microphone. The entire orientation was spent with Alyssa trying to pay attention and not look over at her new roommate. She wasn't being very successful, but on more than one occasion, she found those blue eyes looking right back at her.</p>
		<p>After the orientation, lunch was served and the women began to talk about the opening of the season party that evening in the crew's lounge. It was B.Y.O.B and most of the women had planned ahead and brought alcohol on board with them. Alyssa had never thought about that when she packed as she had never been much of a drinker. The woman assured her that there would be plenty to go around and that she should just show up. After lunch, the crew was released to meetings in their various departments. Alyssa parted ways with her new friends with a promise to show up at the party later that evening and headed toward the Purser's office. Kelsey watched as the women watched Alyssa away from their group and the whispering that went on among the little gang. <i>'Damn, of all the groups to attach herself to...she goes out of her way an picks the worst! Lord knows what they've already told her.'</i> Kelsey shoved her papers in her portfolio and headed toward the equipment room with her team. There were still schedules to decide upon and events to plan, she knew that she had a full afternoon ahead of her. She wouldn't be able to talk to Alyssa and warn her until later that evening. <i>'Let's just hope she doesn't have a problem with it, cabin switching at this late date would cause a world of trouble for both of them.'</i></p>
