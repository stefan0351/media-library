<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 2 -->

<p>"You know, I never thought the day would come that I would see this,"  Buffy said not trying to hide the smile that covered her face upon  seeing Cordelia holding up two packages of Kraft macaroni.  The  brunette had the microwavable stuff in one hand, and the original in  the other and seemed to be thinking very carefully about which would  give you the most for your dollar.   </p>

<p>"Yes, how the mighty have fallen," Cordelia muttered placing the  microwave stuff back on the shelf and tossing the other box in the  shopping cart.  "You know, it's really in poor taste to beg me to  accompany you to the grocery store and then insult me for price  comparing.  I only had your best interests at heart," the brunette  continued as they began to make their way down the isle.  " `Oh  Cordelia, we have no food, for I was searching for my monetary place  amongst men and had not time to clip coupons.  Oh Cordelia shopping  alone is ever so boring and I've been so very lonesome since my  return for hell.  Oh Cordelia my piddly little legs cannot reach the  high shelves, if you don't come with me whatever shall I do?'" the ex- cheerleader continued reaching up as the entered the next aisle  pulling down a can of soup.  "I gave up tanning at the beach for you,  the least you could do is mock me behind my back."</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment, and as Cordelia looked over she could  see that blonde was making a great show of looking deep in  thought.  "After carefully considering what you just said," Buffy  began as they entered the cereal aisle and began scanning for sugary  goodness.  "Of course ignoring mostly everything after `yes, how the  mighty have fallen', I feel that I have to say, MY LEGS ARE NOT  PIDDLY!"</p>

<p>"You're like one of those computer generated midgets from that Ring  movie," the brunette replied smiling as the Slayer tossed a box of  Corn Pops into the shopping cart and shot her a nasty look.  "Awww,  look at her pout," she continued in a baby voice as Buffy began to  move further down the hall.</p>

<p>"You know, I'm beginning to remember why we hated each other," the  Slayer muttered hoping in the air slightly to grab a box of hot  chocolate.  She had decided that she wasn't going to give the ex- cheerleader the honor of collecting items from the high shelves  anymore.</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled to herself watching the blonde's little display,  deciding to hang back for a little while to give the appearance of  being shamed.  The blonde was actually quite amusing when she was  angry so Cordelia didn't really mind.</p>

<p>"We never hated each other did we?" the ex-cheerleader asked finally  making her way back beside the Slayer.  "I never hated you," she  continued as the Slayer glanced over in her direction.  "I know that  the moments when I didn't have my bitch on, were few and far between,  but I never treated you any worse than I did my friends."</p>

<p>"I hated you," Buffy responded as Cordelia reached for a jar of  peanut butter.  "For about a minute and a half in 10th grade."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Cordelia asked looking at Buffy briefly before continuing on  ahead of the blonde.  She needed the moment it would take Buffy to  catch up with her to collect herself.  When the first part of Buffy's  statement had reached her ears she felt as if her heart had stopped,  no matter how briefly, and it shook her.  She hadn't realized before  then that she cared what Buffy Summers had thought of her.</p>

<p>"It was a couple of months after we had moved here.  I was cold, and  hungry and probably had dirt clinging to various parts of my body,"  Buffy continued quickening her step until she was beside Cordelia  once more.  "We were at the Bronze, and I looked across the room and  I saw you, you were dancing with Owen and I hated you for the next  few minutes."</p>

<p>"Why?  He left looking for you," Cordelia responded ceasing her  movements and looking over at the Slayer.  Of all of the moments for  Buffy to choose, of all of the times they had crossed paths, and  traded insults, for Buffy to have chosen a moment she wasn't even  aware of to hate her seemed confounding.</p>

<p>"Because when I looked at you I saw everything that I could've had  but wouldn't," the blonde responded quietly.  "And I don't mean  Owen," she continued with a small smile.  "I meant friends, respect,  a social life, ignorant bliss, possibility.  You were what I could've  been with taller shoes and darker hair, and for a moment I hated you  for having it."</p>

<p>"I never knew," Cordelia responded a moment later, her voice barely a  whisper.  She wasn't quite sure what to make of what Buffy had just  told her, or what to make of the fact that she had been told at all.</p>

<p>"It was only for a moment," the Slayer replied eyeing the brunette  before allowing a cheerless little smile to dance briefly across her  lips.  "Besides," she went on in Cordelia's silence.  "It was silly.   You were never really that girl I hated anyway, were you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I was," the brunette replied as they started down the aisle  again.  "Maybe not.  Maybe sometimes.  I don't know.  I was a mystery  unto myself."</p>

<p>"Weren't we all?" Buffy asked glancing down at the list in her  hand.  "Aren't we still?"</p>

<p>"That's gloomy," the brunette responded turning her head to observe  the woman beside her.</p>

<p>"That's life," Buffy responded with a sigh tossing a carton of orange  into the cart carelessly.</p>

<p>"That's even gloomier," Cordelia replied before glancing over Buffy's  shoulder and heading towards the next item on the list.  Surveying  the cheeses in front of her Cordelia frowned, no wonder the blonde  wasn't glad to be back.  Not knowing, not caring to know, not  believing that knowledge was possible.  With an outlook like that  life on earth could as well be hell.</p>
