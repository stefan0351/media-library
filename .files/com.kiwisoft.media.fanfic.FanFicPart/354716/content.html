<!-- Course: Redemption \ Part 7 -->

<P>"What can I say, love is in the air, and it's casting a greenish glow." Harry grimaced at Neelixes attempt at humor. "What about Tom?" Neelix seemed genuinely saddened. "I think Tom had been on thin ice from the start and he finally broke through the surface." Harry shook his head. "After everything else B'Elanna always forgave him?" "Yes, but there was never a better option." Harry scoffed. "Better? The two fight worse then Tom and B'Elanna ever did." "You're right there is a lot of emotion between them isn't there?" Harry shook his head. "That's not what I meant Neelix, and you know it!"</P>
<P>"Harry, except for the Doctor and Captain Janeway you have probably spent more time with Seven then any other member of the crew. Can you tell me you couldn't see how she feels for B'Elanna?" When Harry didn't reply and stared at the mess halls floor Neelix continued. "Or perhaps you didn't want to?" "No, I noticed. I even tried to find out what B'Elanna was doing right. I don't know if you noticed my more assertive self?" Neelix grinned. "I think most of the crew has." Harry returned the grin, but it was tinged with sadness. "I guess it was too little, too late huh?"</P>
<P>"Not at all, I think in this case those two have things in common that just can't be duplicated, but enough differences to keep things interesting." "They spent the night together. Well it was a day, but they both slept together, though it was in Cargo Bay 2." Wordlessly, even breathlessly Ensign Kim's eyes got wide and Neelix blushed. "I'm pretty sure all they did was sleep, or regenerate. B'Elanna camped out on the floor during Seven's regeneration cycle." Harry seemed anguished, but he dug and found some inner reserve to steady himself with. "Now we need to help them along?"</P>
<P>Neelix smiled. "It's like the plants in Keses garden. It needs to be given plenty of care to grow healthy and strong." "You know they probably would hate us if they learned we were trying to help them along?" Neelix simply arched his brows. "Well I'm not going to tell them." Harry exhaled. "How can I help?" In response to Neelixes expression his face steeled. "You were right, B'Elanna IS my friend, and Seven is too. If I can't be the one to make her happy I am at least going to make sure she is with someone who will."</P>

<P>"Seven, you CAN come in here." The voice of Lieutenant Torres seemed amused, but a careful observer might notice a slight bit of shyness. The blonde head seemed to peek around the doorway as it was followed by the rest of Seven of Nine. She was attempting her casual Borg expression, but it seemed somewhat feeble when she saw the now clean and completely naked form of B'Elanna Torres step from the shower. The women stared at each other until B'Elanna looked down at herself. The action seemed to free Seven to speak. "You are exquisite." They both seemed startled by the sudden expansion of Seven's vocabulary, but B'Elanna's wide smile seemed grateful.</P>
<P>Seven seemed regretful as B'Elanna started to get dressed, but that simply earned her a smirk, which got B'Elanna a smirk in turn. Both women grinning, but both obviously bashful. Seven was the first to speak while B'Elanna finished putting on her uniform. "What shall we do this evening, besides sleep in YOUR quarters?" The half klingon threw the former drone a look, but then smiled. "That's later, though I suppose we should get some rest so we will be ready for the staff meeting tomorrow." Now that B'Elanna was dressed Seven's typical expression seemed firmly back in place. "That will not be necessary, you and I have been reassigned to work on the improved warp engines."</P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed taken back so Seven continued. "Mr. Neelix informed me when he informed me of the attempts by Ensign Paris to break into the Cargo Bay." A dark look crossed B'Elanna's face as she affixed her commbadge, but as she was about to affix her collar pin symbol Seven stepped forward. She took the symbol as B'Elanna looked at her, then lifted her chin. Neither was breathing as the symbol was put in its place with out a sound. As Seven stepped back she seemed her normal calm, but her eyes betrayed a tenderness. The dark look didn't quite make it back, but B'Elanna did seem sobered. "I think Tom is going to have to be my first order of business."</P>
<P>Seven arched her brow, but now the expression that normally left her incensed just had her arching her brows in turn. "Need I remind you that we are working together?" B'Elanna shook her head. "On the engines, not on this." A look of hurt crossed Seven's eyes. "We must work together on everything. I need that unity." B'Elanna stepped forward and touched the taller woman's cheek as she then kissed her softly. "I'm the one who was stupid enough to get involved with him in the first place. I don't want to make that your problem too." Seven seemed both grateful for B'Elanna's touch and heedless of it as she looked into the woman's eyes. "If we are unified ones problems belong to the other as well. Even if the only support we can offer is giving them our time and energy."</P>
<P>The brow under the ridged forehead furrowed as she thought. They were a Collective. In Seven's mind from her perspective they formed a Collective of two. While drones may work on separate tasks it ended up benefiting the whole. Their eyes met and B'Elanna conveyed her understanding. "Ok, what should we do about Tom?" Seven smiled. "I believe we should do nothing. Anything we do Mr. Paris will perceive as an attack, which will cause him to escalate the conflict further." "So we are just going to let him get away with trying to break in on us while we are sleeping?" Seven nodded. "Mr. Neelix has resolved that situation. Now we should remain alert for the next one."</P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed to mimic Seven as she raised her brow. "How do you know there will be a next one?" "The personality of Mr. Paris would indicate further attempts to disrupt our relationship and reclaim you. Which I can not blame him for." The last sentence seemed little louder then a whisper as B'Elanna then stepped close and wrapped her arms around Seven's waist. "We'll it's not going to happen. Tom's been a loser his entire life and he's just going to have to deal with it, but what did you mean about not blaming him?" Seven's eyes looked deeply into B'Elanna's. "You are beyond value, so attempting to regain you is only logical."</P>
<P>B'Elanna blushed and seemed to bury her face against Seven chest. The woman bringing her enhanced hand to caress B'Elanna's hair while her human hand rested at the small of the engineer's back. B'Elanna then brought her face from its resting-place and looked up at Seven. "Well we have already sorted out the information we recovered so should we go cordon off a corner of engineering and get to work?" Seven shook her head. "I believe a science lab would be more suitable." B'Elanna grinned. "I think you just want me to yourself." Again Seven shook her head. "I just assumed you would be less comfortable with my displays off affection in front of your engineering crew." An attractive blush was Seven's only answer.</P>

<P>"It has to be Borg technology, that's the only answer. She somehow managed to assimilate B'Elanna when we weren't looking." Harry did his best to not look put out as his friend Tom Paris launched right into the thoughts that were ripping around in his head. As he sat in a corner of the mess hall that was usually barren, but even more so as the crew gave the jilted helmsman a wide berth. "Tom, you can't really think Seven did something to hurt B'Elanna." Tom looked up and Harry could see the dark circles under his eyes, his first word coming out almost like a sigh. "No, she had no way to know I would barge ahead and propose. I just don't know what to do Harry. Do you remember when I went undercover to find out who was reporting to Seska?"</P>
<P>When Harry nodded Paris continued. "Neelix asked me why I was leaving and I told him how I mess everything up must mean that on some level I don't want any friends. I was partially right. It's not that I don't want friends, it's that I don't want to have to put anything into them. I just want constant happiness, and endless joy. Heaven forbid I would have to put anything into it. I guess I just want life to be one big holo-program. Or I did. That's the problem Harry, I loose B'Elanna just as I am getting the idea. Which, to use sickbay terms is like finding the cure after the patient has died." Harry shrugged. "Well, then you just keep the cure on file and use it on the next patient." Tom shook his head. "I'm not out of the running yet."</P>
<P>"Tom, what are you planning?" Ensign Paris seemed to be getting far more animated as he spoke. "What? Seven stole B'Elanna from me so I am going to steal her back. Seems only fair." "Tom, you're doing it again. Seven and B'Elanna seem to be making something wonderful together, and you just expect her to drop it and come running back to you." His hands seemed ready to flail but they rested pointing at Harry. "She already has something wonderful, me. Let Seven find her own lover. You've been carrying a torch for her since she got on the ship." Harry shrugged even as the words bit deep. "Yeah, but the difference is I want Seven to be happy, and that seems to mean she'll be with B'Elanna."</P>
<P>"Yeah, but couldn't she be just as happy with you? Then everyone gets to be happy." Harry shook his head. "It might work that way in a holodeck, but reality would have B'Elanna hating the both of us, Seven in a state that would make your average drone look cuddly, and you and I would STLL be alone." Paris was shaking his head, but he was also refusing to look at his friend, which caused Harry to sigh. "Tom, promise me you won't do anything hasty. Promise!" Paris shook his head, but he didn't seem very enthusiastic about it.</P>

<P>"Seven! We're supposed to be working." The tone was typical Seven, but the grin was anything but. "We are working." B'Elanna smirked back at her. "You're supposed to be working on the engine, not on me. Though I am a bit surprised, I have never seen this side of you." Seven was still smiling, but it had become shy. "This experience is new to me, and I wish to gather all I can from it." B'Elanna heard the words, but she also head the emotion underneath them and she stepped forward to catch the drone's hips in her hands and stretch up to kiss her.</P>
<P>"Seven, this is not a singular experience. you initiated a mating bond with me. I'm not letting you go that easily." The shy expression was complimented by a blush, which Torres openly adored. Seven tried not to blush further as she turned back to the console. B'Elanna did as well, but was sure to brush up against Seven, and linger there. As she too got back to work she spoke with out looking. "I give as good as I get Borg." Seven pressed into the contact. "A hypothesis I will be sure to test." The Klingon brow arched. "You really are getting good at this. "I adapt quickly." B'Elanna grinned. "A hypothesis I will be sure to test." The women were smiling together, but the smiles turned to frowns in unison as the science lab's doors opened.</P>
<P>"Ensign Paris." Seven was the first to address their visitor and as she did so she seemed to step in front of B'Elanna. The gesture did not go unnoticed and Tom held his hands up in a placating gesture. "I'm not here to fight either of you." He took a deep breath. "I'm not quite sure why I'm here. The only thing I am sure of is that I don't want to fight either of you. I guess that's why I'm here. I just hope we can all move on." Seven was the first to speak again. "Yes, WE will move on." The woman standing behind her put a hand on her elbow and slid in front. "I hope we can to Tom. I really do. It's going to be in your hands."</P>
<P>The helmsman looked at her with undisguised longing, which caused B'Elanna to look pained, and Seven to narrow her eyes. The man then nodded and left. B'Elanna let out a long sigh, which cause Seven to look at her. "Whew, I'm glad that's over, and it is Seven. Now it is officially over." Seven continued to examine the one who had assimilated her so long ago. "I hope that someone will be sure to inform Mr. Paris." B'Elanna looked hurt. "Don't you trust me?" Seven stepped closer to her as her voice grew soft. I trust you, and I trust your responces. I also trust that will not keep Mr. Paris from trying to steal you back." B'Elanna could see Seven's arms were spread to wrap around her and she gratefully stepped into the embrace.</P>
