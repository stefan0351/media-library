<!-- Second Chance \ Part 5 -->

<p>When I came back to consciousness, before I even managed to open my
eyes I realized I was in the place I hated most in all the world. Sunnydale
hospital, where I spent eight months as a vegetable thanks to B. Not that I
can blame her for putting me here in the first place. I was wicked psycho
back then and tried to kill Angel. Knowing that she chose him over me still
makes me sick, even if I am with her now. But then I have to realize that
it’s not like I ever really told her how I felt. At least not in a way she
would understand. She was too naïve to get the meaning behind all those
sexual innuendos of mine.</p>

<p>Before my thoughts get the best of me I hear arguing coming from outside of
my room and I force my eyes open. It’s bright as hell in my room, but I
figure my eyes just need some time to adjust. “B?” I whisper, hoping she’s
in the room with me. I feel two soft hands cover one of my own, but know
they’re too big to be B’s.</p>

<p>“She’s out in the hall with Willow,” the person, who’s voice I recognize as
Dawn’s tells me. I blink my eyes rapidly a few times trying to get them to
focus, and finally I see her smiling down at me.</p>

<p>“How long was I out of it this time?” In response she just laughs at me,
which I’m hoping is a good sign.</p>

<p>“It was only for a few hours Faith, but you had us worried. Especially me.”
My sight is getting clearer thanks to my slayer healing I assume and I
notice her eyes are red from crying.</p>

<p>“You know me, I’m five by five. You don’t think I’d be leaving my new
family already do you? I gotta keep kickin’ so I can take care of you and
B.” I was almost stunned that I called them my family, and from the look on
Dawn’s face she was too. I never had a family before, or at least not one
that cared about me. It’s weird to think I’ve finally gotten one so late
into my life, but the word flowed so easily from my mouth. “B’s okay right?”
I ask suddenly remembering the demon that put me here in the first place.</p>

<p>“Yeah, she’s okay. She was in here but,” Dawn trailed off, and she looked
almost afraid to continue. I guess I can’t expect them to always remember
I’m not the same monster I was before, and that I couldn’t ever be mad at
her. I have a pounding headache and talking only makes it worse so I only
squeeze her hand in reassurance. “I know everyone around here kind of holds
a grudge against you other than Buffy and me, and that you probably don’t
want to deal with them yet since you’ve only been back for a day but I told
Willow you were here. Buffy called me and told me what happened and I was so
scared. I just wanted to come here and make sure you were okay and that I
didn’t loose another person I care about like I did mother so I called
Willow and asked her to bring me here. They’re kind of out there fighting
about things now.”</p>

<p>“Red’s not to happy that I’m back huh?” I ask with a chuckle as Dawn shakes
her head. If I weren’t stuck here, I would have loved to see the look on
Red’s face when Dawn told her I was back. Of course I am back to make
amends, but some things will never change. Like the thrill I get from
spooking out the scoobs. “You think you could tell B I’m ready to get the
hell out of here?”</p>

<p>A few seconds after she leaves my room they B comes in with a very
skeptical red head behind her. If Dawn weren’t in the room I would have said
something just to piss Red off. I know B would forgive me, but I don’t want
the kid to see how fucked up I can be. Of course, if I can’t be nasty I can
always get to her in other ways. B notices the smile spread across my face
and her eyes narrow as she walks closer to me. She knows I’m up to
something, and she’ll probably kick my ass for this when I’m better but
it’ll be worth it. As soon as she’s close enough I pull her down into a deep
kiss.</p>

<p>She doesn’t respond at first, probably because Red’s in the room but
eventually she relents and kisses me back. I can hear Dawn giggling in the
background and B quickly pulls herself away from me, her face fully flushed.
Red looks like a deer caught in headlights so I start giggling along with
Dawn. Yes, I was actually giggling. It is the new me after all, and when I’m
around Dawn I seem to devolve a few years and my brain functions as if I
were Dawns age. B glares at us, letting us know we’re both in trouble when
we get home which just leads us to laughing harder, of course until the
throbbing in my head resumed.</p>

<p>“Oh Goddess, I gotta,” and Red was out the door before she could even
finish her sentence.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe you two,” Buffy said almost angrily. “Willow’s my best
friend and you can’t just go scaring her off like that.” I feel almost
ashamed for what I did, but seeing the look on Red’s face was still worth it
to me.</p>

<p>“It’s not her fault Buffy. We were talking before I got you and I dared her
to do it.” I spin my head so fast to look at Dawn I think I could’ve given
myself whiplash. Dawn was actually trying to take the wrap for me? Out of
everything that’s ever happened in my life, nothing has ever compared to the
amount of happiness that gave me, not even B saying she loved me. B is
everything to me, but no one’s ever been willing to take the blame for me
before. She even looked so proud about it, I just sat there stunned, unable
to tell B she was lying.</p>

<p>“I’m going to go fill out the paper work so we can get out of here. You two
be good, or else I’ll send you to your rooms when we get home,” B says in
that motherly voice of hers that leaves me and Dawn no choice but to mumble
‘yes mommy dearest.’</p>

<p>When B’s gone I have Dawn help me change back into my street clothes and
somehow I decide I should talk to her about the things I did before. “Hey D,
you know you’re like a kid sister to me right?” I ask and she looks at me
and nods. “Do you know about the things I did before I went to prison, and
why everyone around here hates me?”</p>

<p>“Kind of,” she answers honestly. “I know of what you did, but not in detail
or anything. Everyone figured I was too young I guess, but I know it was
pretty bad stuff if they wouldn’t tell me about it.” She hands me my shoes
without even looking at me. I can tell that even though she didn’t know
everything, the memories of what happened still hurt her. It was hard for me
to talk about this stuff again, and while a part of me thought I should be
discussing this stuff with B first, it seemed so much easier with Dawn.</p>

<p>“I hurt your mom D. Willow, Xander, Wesley, everyone I touched I hurt. I
was in love with B and I tried to kill Angel and I was so hurt and messed
up. I wanted B but I couldn’t have her, and so in my fucked up head I
somehow reasoned with myself that if I couldn’t be happy, B didn’t deserve
happiness either. I… I’m not like that anymore Dawn.” She looks up at me
when I use her full name, knowing like B does that I only use full names
when I’m dead serious. “I love you and B, and I’d die to protect the two of
you. I’ve never had much in my life. I was the type to scrounge up just
enough to get by, but it never bothered me until now. Now that I have you
two, I’ve got the one thing I’ve always wanted most. I have a family and I
swear I’ll take care of the two of you.” I look in her eyes and find so many
questions that she can’t even find the words to ask. I think I covered the
‘why’ in there somewhere, at least the one about why I did all that horrible
stuff. But there’s one question she’s dying to ask, and I know what it is so
I answer before she gets the chance to ask.</p>

<p>“I just wanted to tell you all that, because I know you really look up to
me, and I don’t want you to ever think I’m someone I’m not or that I’m
better than I really am. When I was a kid, I never had family. I had a drunk
mom and an abusive dad, but that’s not family. Me, you and B, that’s family.
Since I was pretty much treated like shit as a kid, I didn’t know how to
handle people when I got older. I still don’t really, which you saw by me
kissing B in front of Red just because I thought it’d be fun to piss Red
off. I won’t be perfect, but I promise I’ll take care of you and B if you
can forgive me for the things I’ve done.” My eyes sting from the tears that
I refuse to let fall. The memories of the things I did are so vivid even now
that it’s painful to think about it, even though I’m glad for it. I know I
deserve to be pained by them for the rest of my life, however long that may
be. I suppose it’s funny knowing that I can open up to Dawn better than B,
but I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that she’s just a kid.</p>

<p>I start to wonder where B is and when I look over at the door I notice
she’s just standing there with tears streaming down her cheeks. A large lump
forms in my throat knowing that B probably just heard everything I said. I
know she’s already read all this stuff in my journal, but something about
her actually hearing me say it makes it difficult, even though I’m not about
to let on to that. Nope, instead I smile weakly and let out a small laugh.
“Guess that saves me from having to go all emotional again huh?” B nods at
me, knowing better than to say anything about it. It’s one of the things I
love most about her. She might not understand everything about me, but she
knows when to drop stuff and finally learned not to push me.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s get you two hell raisers home.” B says as she wraps an arm
around my waist lending me support as we walk out of the room. My head is
still pounding, but I know thanks to my special healing abilities I'll be
five by five in the morning which is always nice. Besides, the headache I
have now isn't even half as bad as the ones I've gotten from some hangovers.
You'd figure as a slayer we wouldn't have to deal with shit like that but we
do and it sucks. Of course now that I have my new family I won't be doing
any more drinking. There's no way I'd want to put them through what my
mother put me through.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>"Geez B, you got us back to your house quick," I mumble as she wakes me up
in the car. I suppose I dozed off sometime during the trip back.</p>

<p>"Our house you mean," she says with a smile.</p>

<p>When we get inside I make my way over to the couch and lay down, already
falling asleep. Taking hits in the head like I did isn't easy, even if you
are a slayer. Dawn comes in and tells me goodnight and gives me a brief hug
before dissapearing up the stairs.</p>

<p>"You ready to go up to bed?" B asks me softly as she sits on the arm of the
sofa. I guess she noticed my look of confusion because she just shook her
head at me again. "You didn't really think I was going to make you sleep on
the couch did you?" Too tired to speak, the blank look I give her says it
all. "Well your sleeping in my room with me. That is if you wanted," she
blushes a little and I sit up to kiss her softly.</p>

<p>"I'd like that B. Just lead the way," I say standing up. The walk up the
stairs seems to drain all my energy but when we get in her room I manage to
rid myself of my clothes. When B notices her face turns redder than Red's
hair and I can't help but laugh, that is until I notice I'm actually
blushing again. "Sorry B, I guess I'm not used to sleeping with other
people." Yeah, that sounded smooth. Some doof I am huh?</p>

<p>"It's okay," she whispers as she blushes even more. I'm too out of it to
really care, because if there's anything that Sunnydale hospital can do,
it's drug people up. She changes into some cute pj's and crawls into her
bed, motioning for me to lay down. "Come on, I still wanna cuddle with you."</p>

<p>"Your going to show me how to do this cuddling stuff right? Because I've
never done it before," I say as I crawl in next to her under the blankets.
As soon as I'm laying down she pulls me into her arms and kisses my
forehead. "Is this cuddling?" I ask meekly, almost embarassed that I've
never had anyone hold me before.</p>

<p>"Yeah. It's nice huh?" I kiss her neck in response and drape one of my arms
loosely around her stomach.</p>

<p>"I like listening to your heartbeat B," I whisper just seconds before I
fall into the first contented sleep of my life.</p>
