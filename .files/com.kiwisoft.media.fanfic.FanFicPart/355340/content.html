<!-- High School Hell \ Going To The Chapel -->

<p>The big wedding day finally arrived and Sam was a big bundle of nerves. Not because her mother was getting married, but because she had to wear that dress. (Formal attire and I do not get along) she thought dryly. The last formal gown she wore had to be cut off of her in blood covered chunks. She shivered. (Geeze, Sam, morose much?) </p>
<p>"You ready Sam?" Brooke asked poking her head in Sam's room. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Think they'll miss me if I don't go?" Brooke walked in the room and rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"I think Mom will notice the conspicuous absence of her Maid of Honor, Sammy," she said lightly. "God, you're not even dressed. Put the dress on Sam, it's not going to kill you." Sam shot her a look. </p>
<p>"Promise me Nicole won't be drinking," she asked. Brooke looked at her in shock. </p>
<p>"Is that what's bothering you? Sam, that was a one time thing. As long as neither one of us goes running into the street we should be fine," Brooke pointed out logically. Sam nodded as Brooke walked over with the dress.</p>
<p>"I suppose one night won't hurt," Sam agreed. Brooke smiled.</p>
<p>"Good, cuz the sooner you put this thing on, the sooner I can get you out of it," she teased. Sam smirked at her. </p>
<p>"Frisky today are we?" she joked as she slipped into the dress. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"As soon as the wedding's over, the `rentals will be gone for three glorious weeks to the Bahama's on their honeymoon with Mac. We have the house to ourselves. I can't wait to get rid of them," she admitted her voice low and sending delighted chills up Sam's spine. </p>
<p>"Me either," Sam said as she captured Brooke's lips in a burning kiss. Stopping themselves before they got out of hand, they finished getting dressed and headed off to the wedding. </p>

<p>The wedding went off without a hitch, (pardon the pun) and finally Mike and Jane were married and they were really a family. An incredibly unusual family but a family nonetheless. The reception was a sight to behold. Sam and Brooke danced together but not any slow dances that would arouse suspicion and had a great time. They hated hiding the truth about themselves but for their mother they went through with it. Jane thanked them repeatedly. </p>
<p>Nicole noticed that the two girls were unable to dance together and, having heard the reason from Lily, she was trying to find a way around it, for at least one dance. A wicked smile crossed her face as an idea entered her head. She discussed the idea with Lily, Josh, and the rest of the mixed gang before going through with it. </p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," the DJ started. "This is a special request from someone in our audience. But it's not a couples dance, it's a song to say how love can mean different things to different people and how doubts can sometime get in our way. We can't let that happen. So grab someone who means something special to you and dance." Sam and Brooke exchanged glances as Nic leaned over to them. </p>
<p>"Here's your chance," Nic whispered. "You can dance and no one will know." They watched as Lily and Josh got up to dance as did Mary Cherry and Sugar. To draw the attention off of Sam and Brooke, Nic rolled her eyes and grabbed a startled Carmen. Sam and Brooke slowly walked out to the dance floor in the middle of their friends. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">I wonder where your heart is <br>
`Cause it sure don't feel like it's here <br>
Sometimes I think you wish <br>
That I would just disappear <br>
Have I got it all wrong <br>
Have you felt this way long <br>
Are you already gone </font> </p>
<p>"My heart is with you Brooke," Sam whispered in Brooke's ear. "And I never left you." </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Do you feel lonely <br>
When you're here by my side <br>
Does the sound of freedom <br>
Echo in your mind <br>
Do you wish you were by yourself <br>
Or that I was someone else <br>
Anyone else </font> </p>
<p>"I want no one else but you Sammy," Brooke whispered.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Where would you be <br>
If you weren't here with me <br>
Where would you go <br>
If you were single and free <br>
Who would you love <br>
Would it be me <br>
Where would you be </font> </p>
<p>"It'd always be you, Princess. I'll always be here."</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">I don't wanna hold you backNo I don't wanna slow you down
<br>
I don't wanna make you feel <br>
Like you are tied up and bound <br>
`Cause that's not what love's about <br>
If there's no chance we can work it out <br>
Tell me now <br>
Oh, tell me tell me now </font> </p>
<p>"You know all that, right?" Brooke asked. Sam nodded.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Where would you be <br>
If you weren't here with me <br>
Where would you go <br>
If you were single and free <br>
Who would you love <br>
Would it be me <br>
Where would you be </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Have I become the enemy <br>
Is it hard to be yourself <br>
In my company </font>
</p>
<p>"Brooke?" </p>
<p>"Never." </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Where would you be <br>
If you weren't here with me <br>
Where would you go <br>
If you were single and free <br>
Who would you love <br>
Would it be me <br>
Where would you be <br>
Oh tell me tell me now <br>
Where would you be <br>
Where would you go <br>
Who would you love <br>
Would it be me </font> </p>
<p>Jane watched the whole thing from her seat and thought it was sweet. Mike ignored it mostly but even he thought it was endearing and mostly unnoticable by the other partygoers. There was no doubting though, by anyone who knew Brooke and Sam, that they were deeply in love. They all but glowed on the dance floor together. After the song ended they thanked Nic and went back to their table. Brooke got her wish; she got to dance one slow dance at the wedding with Sam. </p>
