<P>A.N. Ok so this was supposed to be a oneshot but you guys wanted another chapter? ... and here it is. This time from Miley's pov. Enjoy!</P><P><U>Closer When Dreaming â€“ Chapter Two</U></P><P>How long had I known about my feelings? God, they've been a part of me for so long I don't think I can remember the exact time, but I was about fifteen when they started to make sense to me. We had sleepovers all the time and then one night I woke up at about two in the morning and I had somehow made my way closer to Lilly than normal. We weren't quite touching but my hand was in front of my face and a mere inch from Lilly's. Her head was facing towards me and I could feel the gentle breaths coming from her mouth. My hand was tingling every time I felt it and I couldn't help myself as I moved closer to her before closing my eyes to give myself over to the feelings. I knew it wasn't right but I figured as long as I wasn't hurting Lilly that indulging in these feelings wouldn't matter.</P><P>I know you're probably wondering why feelings for Lilly would be wrong so I'll tell you. She's my best friend, me being in love with my female best friend was never in the cards for me but I went ahead and did it anyway.</P><P>Not long after I figured out what I had been feeling I woke up to find that I had moved closer still in the night and my hand was resting on Lilly's stomach, clutching at the vest top material. I smiled as I realised that Lilly has moved closer to me. Not long after this, Lilly suggested we started having Saturday night sleepovers as well as Friday nights and of course, I jumped at the opportunity to spend more time with her.</P><P>Then, just after my sixteenth birthday, I woke up one morning after our sleepover to find that my hand had made its way under Lilly's vest top. I froze for a moment but the feeling of Lilly's skin under my fingers, especially her toned stomach did things to me that I couldn't deny and I then noticed that Lilly's arm was snaked around my shoulders pulling me closer to her and I melted. I breathed in deeply, taking in the unique scent that was Lilly before I felt her start to wake up and scolded myself over my lack of control but she didn't even seem to notice our new closer positions; in fact we seemed to keep waking up like that every single time we were together from that morning onwards. I never questioned why Lilly never asked about our sleeping positions, everyday she would treat me exactly the same as usual and there would be no hint of any further feelings, so I took my cue from her. We were best friends and we drooled over guys together on the beach or at the mall or school but we always seemed to gravitate to the same positions when we were sleeping. Quite honestly I was afraid that if I mentioned it that she would start to want to sleep on the floor in a sleeping bag or something or even worse, not come to spend the nights at all so I kept it as my secret pleasure, my secret addiction.</P><P>The thing about it is that when I went to sleep, I was never touching Lilly. I always moved towards her when I was asleep, it must have been my subconscious wanting to get as close to her as possible. I always seemed to wake up just minutes before Lilly, which surprised me because she was always the morning person but I loved to just take those few minutes to take in the feeling of having Lilly's arm wrapped tightly around me, to have my hand gently stroke the soft skin of her stomach and to take in a deep breath to fill my senses with Lilly's scent. I knew I shouldn't but it really was like an addiction to me.</P><P>A few months after I first woke up to find my hand under her vest top, I woke up to find I had gone one step further in my subconscious attempt to get closer and that I was practically lying on top of Lilly. My leg had found it's way between hers and my lips were almost resting on her collarbone. I paused for a moment to take in this new position and then before I could stop myself I gently kissed her collarbone. Lilly moaned underneath me and I smiled at her reaction before instantly feeling guilty. She was my best friend, for crying out loud, I'm basically taking advantage of her. Yet I couldn't stop placing that gentle kiss every time I woke up before she did.</P><P>This brings me to our current moment in time. Lilly and I had both been accepted to UCLA and we were both eighteen. Tomorrow we are moving into the apartment I had brought with some of my Hannah money and I was really excited and happy that I would be living with Lilly. She had told me about some silly idea about moving into student housing which I so was not about to let her do, especially when I was going to be getting my own place anyway. I had asked Daddy about whether I should buy or rent a place and he had told me to buy. Daddy still managed my Hannah money for me. When I was eighteen he told me he was handing the lot over to me but honestly the amount I had earned over the years was ... startling to say the least, so I asked to keep managing it for me and he had agreed. We had looked at several places near campus until I had found the perfect apartment, but it wasn't until I had finished packing the last of the boxes and labelled it 'Miley's room' until I realised that we wouldn't be having anymore sleepovers. That I would never be able to wake up with Lilly tucked under me and take in that deep breath. I had sat down heavily on the bed and looked up at Lilly and suggested one final sleepover. She had smiled, almost sadly and agreed at once.</P><P>I woke up the morning of the move to find me in the usual position. I placed the kiss on her collarbone and took in the deep breath before pausing and gently lifting myself to look in the face of Lilly Truscott. God, she is so beautiful. Right in that moment I lost my senses slightly as I leaned over Lilly and softly kissed her lips. As I pulled away I looked down at her still sleeping face and whispered, "I love you Lilly", before settling back down to wait for Lilly to wake up as I sure wasn't going to move from where I was until I had to. I tried to comfort myself with one last thought.</P><P><I>Maybe we'll only have time to get one bed set up today.</I></P><P>A.N. I may or may not have a few more chapters of this after they have moved into the new apartment ... so please review, thanks Nicki xoxo</P>
