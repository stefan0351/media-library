<p>Thank you to all my devoted readers; I'm glad you're all still curious about this and trying to figure out my plot. I think I'll keep you on your toes for a while, though, before I give away any answers ;)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter XI</b></p>
<p>Lilly was out of the car and running up the front steps before her mother could remind her to be home for dinner. At least they hadn't tried to stop her from coming here straight away, but Lilly couldn't help feel some resentment towards them. If they hadn't forced her to go on this useless trip, she could have been there for her girlfriend two days ago.</p>
<p>She barged into the house without knocking, but then remembered her manners and called out. The farmhouse was eerily silent and despite the nice weather outside there was none of the normal draft indicating doors and windows were open. Lilly called out again and finally received an answer. She made her way into the kitchen, where she found Mrs. Stewart baking.</p>
<p>"Is Miley okay?" Lilly couldn't help the first words that spilled from her mouth.</p>
<p>Susan smiled, though it seemed half-hearted. "Well, hello to you, too, Lilly."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Stewart. I'm just worried," said Lilly, though she knew if the woman was joking Miley had to be fine.</p>
<p>"I know, Lilly, I'm just teasin' ya. She's upstairs in her room."</p>
<p>"She's inside?" Lilly couldn't hide her surprise, assuming it would take an act of God to keep Miley inside on such a beautiful day.</p>
<p>Susan's smile fell and she looked away briefly, before meeting Lilly's eyes. "I can't let her outside, Lilly. I just can't. The doctor said she'd die the next time andâ€¦I just can't."</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed, unsure of what to say. "For how long?"</p>
<p>The woman didn't respond, but the look in her eyes told Lilly all she needed to know. She shook her head. "You can't keep her locked up inside forever."</p>
<p>"I've already lost a child and a husband, don't tell me what I can't do to save my daughter," said Susan, though she didn't sound angry as much as resolute. Lilly hadn't intended to make the woman mad, but before she could apologize Susan waved her off. "Miley's waiting for you."</p>
<p>Lilly hesitated, but Susan had already turned her attention back to the bowl before her, so she turned and made her way up the stairs towards her girlfriend's room. The door was wide open when Lilly entered and Miley was too engrossed in looking out the window, headphones on, to notice her. Lilly watched her in silence for several minutes, trying to force away her own worry and disarrayed thoughts. Miley finally turned and, upon seeing her girlfriend in the doorway, smiled widely. Lilly steeled herself and walked over, planting a kiss on Miley's lips before sitting across from her in the window niche. Miley wasted no time in propping her legs across Lilly's lap and removed her headphones.</p>
<p>"Hey there Roadkill, you alright?" asked Lilly, not wanting to sound too worried or overbearing, but it was hard.</p>
<p>"Yes, other than momma won't let me go outside," said Miley, frowning in the most adorable way.</p>
<p>"She's got a good reason, Miles. You did just get struck by lightning." If Lilly were honest with herself, she'd have to admit she, too, preferred to keep Miley inside, forever safe from the danger that awaited her outside.</p>
<p>Miley scrunched up her face and shrugged. "I think if the lightning wants to strike, it will find a way no matter where I am."</p>
<p>Lilly paled at the words and smacked the side of her girlfriend's legs. "Don't say that, Miley. Everyone just wants you to be safe."</p>
<p>Miley nodded half-heartedly, but then, as if remembering something, her face lit up again. "I've got to tell you who I saw!"</p>
<p>Lilly sat silently while Miley recounted her strange visit with her father and brother, and an increased sense of worry seeping into her with every word. Miley seemed more than excited by her story, but to Lilly it spelled only more trouble.</p>
<p>"So, your dead father told you Richard is out to kill you?"</p>
<p>"No, he said <b>someone</b> is. But I'm sure it's Richard," said Miley, glad Lilly believed her about the encounter with Jackson and her father.</p>
<p>"I know he's done some suspicious things and I'm not sure I believe everything he says, but what makes you think he wants to kill you?" asked Lilly, not ready to believe such heady accusations about a man who had technically never done anything bad or wrong. Miley filled her in on Richard's odd behavior just prior to the strike and at the hospital, though even that was not enough to condemn him in Lilly's eyes.</p>
<p>"Are you really sure he knew that lightning strike was about to happen? How would he even know that?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "The same way I know?"</p>
<p>"You mean he's a lightning magnet with a penchant for climbing trees?"</p>
<p>Miley smirked. "Look at you using all these big words after going on a college tour."</p>
<p>"Look at you changing the topic when you've run out of plausible answers," countered Lilly, only half joking, but the smirk on her girlfriend's face just would not allow her to be annoyed.</p>
<p>"I say we're done talking," said Miley and stood very abruptly. Lilly watched her go, wondering for a brief moment if her words had angered her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"What're you doing?"</p>
<p>"Closing the door." Miley did exactly that and turned, the grin on her face giving away her intentions. She walked back to the middle of the room and cocked her head at Lilly. "I can't go outside; I've got to get my exercise somehow."</p>
<p>Lilly raised an eyebrow at the insinuation, but had to fight hard to suppress the smirk wanting to erupt on her own face. She stood and walked over to Miley, standing mere inches away. Finally, she grinned. "I guess I can't argue with that." Lilly cupped Miley's cheeks with both hands and pulled her closer, until their lips met in a heated kiss.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>She probably should have asked for better instructions before they started playing, but as it stood, Lilly had no idea what she was doing. The cards she held may have been a winning hand for all she knew. A quick glance across the table told her that the three adults were very serious about this game, however, and she tentatively picked some cards from the pile. She realized it had been the wrong move the second she caught Grandma Ruby's eye next to her but it was too late and, truth be told, Lilly couldn't have cared less.</p>
<p>A head suddenly hit her shoulder and she turned to look at her girlfriend. Miley had her face buried against Lilly's shoulder, her own cards spread haphazardly across her part of the table. Lilly nudged her slightly, but the other girl didn't move.</p>
<p>"Miley," Lilly tried, keeping an eye on the game still going on. Susan played her cards and all eyes turned to Miley. "Miles, it's your turn."</p>
<p>Miley merely groaned. "This game is boring."</p>
<p>"You said you wanted to play, hun," said Susan with only half a sigh. Ever since the last lightning strike and Dr. Khauf's dire warning, she had tried to keep Miley as happy as possible, but it wasn't hard to see her daughter was getting more and more upset being cooped up inside.</p>
<p>"I said I wanted to go outside," said Miley, not caring that it was dark and cold outside.</p>
<p>"You know you can't, sweetie. What do you wanna do? We'll do whatever you want," said Susan, just trying to keep Miley inside.</p>
<p>Miley mumbled something incoherent and Lilly shifted to hear her better. Miley's face brushed against her neck and Lilly frowned, pushing her girlfriend back slightly. She cupped Miley's cheeks lightly.</p>
<p>"Miles, you're burning up."</p>
<p>Lilly had hardly finished her sentence before Susan was up out of her chair and next to Miley, feeling her forehead. Miley let herself be pulled in a different direction without complaint, enjoying her mother's attention to the fullest. Susan frowned, as well, and left the dining room, returning a few minutes later with a thermometer. Everyone watched in awkward silence until Susan pulled the thermometer from Miley's mouth.</p>
<p>"101. You've got a fever, hun. Maybe you should go lay down," said Susan, brushing a hand across the top of Miley's head.</p>
<p>"It's 'cause I can't go outside," said Miley seriously, earning herself several scoffs from around the table.</p>
<p>"Why would that give you a fever?" asked Richard, though he merely sounded curious.</p>
<p>"It just does," grumbled Miley, in no mood to get into it with Richard.</p>
<p>Even Susan gave him a look as if to tell him to leave Miley alone when she was obviously sick. Miley grinned at her slight victory, but Susan left her no time to enjoy it, already ushering her daughter out of the room.</p>
<p>"Go lie down; you can watch a movie if you want."</p>
<p>Miley turned and reached a hand out for Lilly, who didn't hesitate to get up, as well. As much as Miley hated to be still and confined, Lilly knew she wouldn't give up a cuddling opportunity if it presented itself. Miley wasted no time jumping on Lilly's back to let herself be carried towards the living room. Susan watched them go, just happy Miley had stopped asking to go outside.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>Lilly stopped just inside the living room, surprised at who she saw. She hadn't been completely silent coming in and three heads turned to look at her. Lilly plastered a smile on her face and walked closer, clutching the books in her hands like life preservers. She gave a small wave to the woman closest to her.</p>
<p>"Hi, Mrs. Stewart. I just came by to drop off some books for Miley." Lilly kept her eyes firmly on Susan's face, though she could easily feel the other two pairs of eyes on her. She tried not to look at Richard or the woman by his side.</p>
<p>"Miley is going to sit and read books?" asked Susan, sounding incredulous.</p>
<p>Lilly's lip twitched. "They're my mom's old knitting books. I thought maybe she could use them now that she's stuck inside."</p>
<p>"Maybe you could ask her to knit me a hat next."</p>
<p>Lilly turned to look at Richard, trying hard not to let the incredulity show on her face. "Yeahâ€¦" she trailed off, unsure of whether he was serious or had been joking with her, "I'll get right on that."</p>
<p>"Oh, Lilly," said Susan from the side, as if suddenly remembering something, "this is Richard's sister, Mandy."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we've met. Hi again," said Lilly, finally having to acknowledge the dark-haired beauty sitting by Richard's side. If he was bringing this woman to the Stewarts' house, maybe he was telling the truth about her. That or he was an even better liar than she had thought.</p>
<p>At the look of confusion falling over Susan's face, Mandy explained. "We met in Murfreesboro a few months ago. It's nice to see you again."</p>
<p>Lilly returned the smile Mandy gave her, but she knew hers was nowhere near as sincere and brilliant. She shifted uncomfortably and turned her attention back to Susan. "Is Miley in her room?"</p>
<p>"She is. She's still not feeling well. If you can convince her to come down for dinner, you're more than welcome to stay," said Susan and though she was smiling, Lilly could easily read the worry in her eyes. She just nodded and swiftly made her way up the stairs.</p>
<p>Miley's door was closed and Lilly entered without knocking. It was starting to get dark outside and there wasn't much light in the room, leaving Lilly standing in the doorway while her eyes adjusted. It took her several moments to find her girlfriend and she immediately walked over to where Miley was sitting on the floor, between the armchair and a bookshelf. She had a blanket drawn around herself, but looked up when Lilly knelt in front of her and smiled.</p>
<p>"Hey Lils, what'd you bring me?"</p>
<p>Lilly set the books down next to her and leaned forward to kiss Miley's forehead, part in greeting and part to test her girlfriend's temperature. Miley was still running a fever, but, other than her odd choice of sitting spot, she seemed fine. Lilly sat back and moved to squeeze herself next to Miley between the book case. Miley immediately leaned into her side and Lilly had to admit the spot on the floor was almost cozy.</p>
<p>"I brought you some knitting books."</p>
<p>"You want me to knit you more hats?" asked Miley, stretching her legs out across Lilly's.</p>
<p>"Maybe you could try for some socks next time," joked Lilly, but when Miley didn't respond she craned her neck to look at her girlfriend. "You feeling alright, Roadkill?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Did you meet Richard's sister?"</p>
<p>Lilly hesitated, wanting to force Miley to tell her the truth. Miley had been running this fever for five days now and she'd had headaches on and off, but if Mrs. Stewart hadn't filled her in, Lilly would never have known. She knew Miley's mom was worried, but Dr. Khauf had stopped by to examine the girl and reassured her it was nothing serious. Lilly knew how much Miley hated being sick, so she let it go. "I did. Did you?"</p>
<p>Miley shook her head. "I don't want to go downstairs. What's she like?"</p>
<p>"Very pretty. A little too friendly. I'm surprised your mom didn't make you go downstairs," said Lilly, thinking back to the many times Susan and Miley had fought over her avoidance of Richard.</p>
<p>"She's trying to keep me happy 'cause I'm sick," said Miley unperturbed.</p>
<p>"Well, she said I can't eat unless you come downstairs," said Lilly, eyes still on her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"She doesn't want you to eat?"</p>
<p>Lilly nudged Miley lightly in the side. "She wants you to come downstairs and figured I'm the only one who can make it happen."</p>
<p>"How are you gonna do that?" asked Miley innocently, but Lilly could easily hear the beginning stages of a grin.</p>
<p>"You'll have to come downstairs first and then I'll show you," said Lilly, tugging on her girlfriend's hand.</p>
<p>Miley scrunched up her face, but let herself be pulled up nevertheless. "You want me to go eat before you convince me to go eat?"</p>
<p>"I want you to come downstairs with me," said Lilly, not giving the other girl a chance to think too much about it. She knew Miley's curiosity of what Lilly may offer her in reward later would win out eventually anyway, and thus just tugged on her girlfriend's hand to pull her along.</p>
<p>Miley, despite her illness, was surprisingly cordial in greeting Mandy, who was acting as if the girl were her favorite celebrity and she had just won a contest to meet her. Lilly would not have batted an eye to hear Mandy ask Miley to take a picture with her. Mandy had even taken the seat right next to Miley when they sat down for dinner, leaving Lilly across from her girlfriend, while the woman would not stop talking. Lilly watched, both annoyed and amused, while Mandy shoveled more mashed potatoes onto Miley's plate.</p>
<p>"â€¦you'll have to come out to the farm one day, Miley," said Mandy, finally ceasing with the mashed potatoes, though she had left a sizeable mountain on Miley's plate.</p>
<p>Miley did not bother to look at the woman trying so hard to have a conversation with her; she'd managed to get through the past thirty minutes with some nods, grunts and stock answers. "What farm?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the farmâ€¦where Richard and Iâ€¦grew up. You'd love it â€“ there are animals and plenty of trees," said Mandy, though her slight hesitation drew Lilly's attention. Mandy's odd behavior from the moment she'd first met the woman had made Lilly wary, but combined with Richard's increasingly suspicious deeds made her incredibly mistrustful of the pair.</p>
<p>"Where is this farm?" asked Lilly, the emphasis she put on the word 'farm' making it sound like some sort of torture chamber.</p>
<p>"Just a few miles east of Murfreesboro. You're more than welcome to come visit with Miley, Lilly," said Mandy, not missing a beat. Lilly glanced at her girlfriend to see what she thought of this, but Miley seemed to hardly be paying attention, busy digging a hole into her mashed potato mountain.</p>
<p>Without her knowing what to say and with Miley disinterested the conversation quickly died. Susan, still eager to get her daughter, and by association her daughter's girlfriend, to like Richard, tried to start the conversation up again. "Lilly, Mandy did her undergrad work at UCLA."</p>
<p>Lilly knew Susan was only trying to get everyone to like each other, but she would have preferred the awkward silence. She once again had nothing to say, unwilling to talk about her favorite school with a woman who was anything but honest. Mandy, however, jumped at the chance to pick the conversation back up and turned to Lilly.</p>
<p>"You want to go to UCLA?"</p>
<p>Lilly gritted her teeth, partly because she didn't want the woman to know anything about her and partly because she still had not made a decision about her future school and didn't want sick Miley to think about where Lilly would go in the future. She wondered whether Mandy had really gone to UCLA or whether this was another lie on par with Richard's. Maybe she could finally trap one of them.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I'm a big fan of the Golden Bears."</p>
<p>Mandy smiled at her, though there was a glint in her eyes that almost made Lilly shrink back. "UCLA are the Bruins."</p>
<p>Their eyes stayed locked for a few seconds, before Lilly nodded numbly. "Of course, I must've just been confused."</p>
<p>Neither Richard nor Susan seemed to know anything was off and engaged Mandy in a different conversation, but even Miley, who was anything but attentive due to her fever, noticed the exchange. She looked at Lilly, who shook her head almost imperceptibly to tell her girlfriend they'd talk about it later. Through the rest of dinner Lilly felt a strong sense of unease that came with the knowledge that something was just not right and she had no way of proving it.</p>
