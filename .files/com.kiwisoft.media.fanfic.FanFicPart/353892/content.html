<P>Janeway was in her ready room with Chakotay going over the duty roster and other ship's business.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna's made a request that Icheb be given more responsibility in engineering, she wants him to have a higher access level."</P>
<P>"As long as he's properly supervised, he's too young to be given major projects," she took a sip of her coffee. "Ouch, hot. And make sure Seven's OK about it, I don't want to find that B'Elanna's press-ganged him into it. Given the chance, she'll recruit everyone to Engineering," </P>
<P>"Except, Neelix," Chakotay added. They both grinned at the thought of the sometimes sullen almost always angry engineer having to deal with the perpetually happy morale officer. </P>
<P>"Anyway, I'm pretty certain B'Elanna's cleared it with Seven already. You must have noticed how well they're getting along these days."</P>
<P>"I just hope it lasts," the Captain was thoughtful. </P>
<P>"It will, I'm sure of it, Seven is a lot more committed than Tom," </P>
<P>Janeway looked up from the data padd she was reading from, "Tom? What has Tom got to do with ..." Realisation dawned. "B'Elanna and Seven? Are you sure?"</P>
<P>At this point Chakotay clued into the fact that the Captain hadn't picked up on the vibes coming from the two women.</P>
<P>"To be honest, Kathryn, I think they are just beginning to realise the attraction they have for each other. Please don't say anything."</P>
<P>Kathryn looked up at him. "You know I wouldn't."</P>
<P>"I know you've always had a soft spot for Seven, you might want to encourage her or warn her about broken hearts or something."</P>
<P>She quirked her mouth in acknowledgement, he was right.</P>
<P>"Darn it, how am I going to be able to just sit and watch?"</P>
<P>"Well this may take your mind off those two," he handed her a stack of padds.</P>
<P>"What's all this?"</P>
<P>"These requisition orders from almost every department. We still haven't fully recovered from our skirmish with the Xenons and in case you haven't noticed the ship is falling apart."</P>
<P>Kathryn gave him a mock-filthy glare, along with Tuvok, he was one of the few people on Voyager who could take liberties.</P>
<P>"I know, what we need is a nice M - class planet, with a technologically advanced and friendly race willing to trade and a nice relaxing climate for the crew to get some RNR."</P>
<P>"Funny you should mention that," he grinned as he handed her yet another padd</P>
<P>"Seven's located a nice M-class planet on long-range sensors. It's about 30 light years away and it's in the wrong direction ..."</P>
<P>"But considering the state of play with the ship a detour may be advisable," she finished his sentence. "Have Tom slow to impulse and get Seven and Harry to see what they can find out about this planet."</P>
<P>"Aye, Captain."</P>

<P>"Another conduit relay has just blown out, Lieutenant," Vorik calmly informed the chief engineer. He watched her close her eyes and grip the console she was working on. He wondered if she would explode or whether she would allow the Vulcan mantra he knew she'd been working on to calm her down. He soon had his answer.</P>
<P>"Fuck this all to grethor and back," she slammed her fist down on the console causing it to spark, blink and then go out. Vorik blinked, he hadn't heard that one before. He stood back, hands clasped behind him, impassive as another stream of obscenities poured forth. </P>
<P>B'Elanna ran out of breath and looked over at the quiet Vulcan. "I'm sorry about that, Vorik."</P>
<P>"Your apology is accepted, Lieutenant."</P>
<P>She sighed and rubbed her ridges, it had been a long day, she had been working for 10 hours straight and things were going from bad to worse. She grabbed a toolkit.</P>
<P>"You  know, Vorik, if we don't get some dilithium and soon, the warp core is going conk out and we'll have to get out and push."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Lieutenant." Vorik knew from old that pointing out the lack of logic in her statements rarely went down well.</P>
<P>"You and Carey take the three blown relays on this deck, I'll take the one on deck 8. Once you've sorted them out, both of you go off duty. You've been working for too long."</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres, may I point out that you have been on duty for approximately 4.5 hours longer than any of us. It would be logical for you also to rest."</P>
<P>She patted his arm as she walked away, " Didn't you know, Vorik? No rest for the wicked."</P>
<P>She crawled in the Jeffries Tube and located the defective relay. Not only had it blown out, it had also fused with several other components. It was going to take the better part of an hour to sort out the mess. She was meant to meet Seven when she got off duty. That was about 4 hours ago. She didn't want to cancel their date? (is that what is was?) so she kept on postponing, but this was ridiculous. She tapped her combadge.</P>
<P>"Torres to Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>"Seven, here." </P>
<P>"Seven, I can't make it tonight. I'm stuck in a Jeffries Tube and I'm going to be here for ages. I know you're already late for your regeneration cycle, I don't want to keep you waiting anymore. Go to bed. I'll see you tomorrow."</P>
<P>"I am disappointed that we will not meet, but please remember what I told you. I am prepared to wait." Seven was alluding to the conversation they'd had a week ago. They had not come to any resolution other than to acknowledge the burgeoning feelings they had for each other.</P>
<P>"I promise I'll see you soon, OK?"</P>
<P>"Acceptable."</P>
<P>"Goodnight, Seven."</P>
<P>"Goodnight, B'Elanna."</P>
<P>Seven looked at the sensor data she had been analysing. Suddenly it didn't seem very interesting any more. She knew that the emotion she was feeling was disappointment, but wasn't sure what to do with it. She knew that she was too restless to regenerate now, and since she was due for a medical check up, she decided to see the doctor.</P>
<P>"Seven, to what do I owe the pleasure?"</P>
<P>The doctor was inappropriately cheerful, Seven thought, especially in light of her recent disappointment.</P>
<P>"You requested that I attend my medical check up, Doctor."</P>
<P>"That was 6 days ago, Seven, but better late than never. Hop up on that biobed and we'll get started."</P>
<P>"I would prefer to stand." Seven looked at the Doctor as he began bustling about.</P>
<P>"Whatever."</P>
<P>30 minutes later...</P>
<P>Seven was exasperated with the doctor. He had spent an inordinate amount of time prodding, poking and testing and she was at the end of her tether.</P>
<P>"Doctor, these tests are an inefficient use of our time, we should ..."</P>
<P>"I beg to differ, Seven. These test have given me invaluable updates on how your system is functioning. And I've some very good news for you. These result show that your dependency on the alcove is gradually becoming less. If we increase your nutritional supplements and start you on sleeping regimen, we can wean you off it for good. Isn't that wonderful news?" the Doctor beamed expansively at Seven.</P>
<P>Seven is less than happy. "I find that eating is an inefficient use of my time and resources. In addition, I do not know how to sleep. I prefer to continue the use of my alcove."</P>
<P>The Doctor frowned at her. "You don't need your alcove anymore, not really. You don't need to be chained to it, don't you see?"</P>
<P>Seven blinked in uncharacteristic uncertainty. Understanding dawned on the Doctor. He put a familiar arm around the ex-drone and waved his other arm about.</P>
<P>"You're just a little frightened that's all, Seven." </P>
<P>"The Borg do not get frightened," she retorted.</P>
<P>"Ah, but that's just it, You are no longer Borg. Not really. You're more human than Borg and you need to adapt. This is just another stage in your continuing development, Seven."</P>
<P>She tilted her head slightly, " Explain."</P>
<P>"Well, most people are afraid of change, or at least wary of it. You know, the fear of the unknown. People prefer and understand what they are used to. Change brings uncertainty, people don't usually change things about themselves simply for the sake of it. It's quite natural to cling to the old and the familiar. And you know that old chestnut ' Better the devil you know ...' Having said that, change is a necessary part of every-ones development."</P>
<P>"Your monologue would indicate that change is a good thing?" Seven's brain was racing. She knew that the topic that the doctor was prattling on about had direct relevance to her and B'Elanna, could it be that the half-Klingon was simply scared of the unknown?"</P>
<P>The Doctor rolled his eyes but answered</P>
<P>"Yes, usually, change is a good thing."</P>
<P>"How can, what you term, the fear of the unknown, be eliminated?"</P>
<P>"Well in your case, Seven, I will recommend to the Captain that you get your own quarters and I'll set up a rota of how long you should regenerate interspersed with periods of sleep and good healthy eating."</P>
<P>"No, I meant..." Seven stopped for moment, unused to prevarication. "I mean in other circumstances."</P>
<P>"Well I suppose one way to embrace change is to try new experiences, see how much you like them. That could bring about change. Now about your meals..."</P>
<P>Seven had switched off, she was thinking hard. <I>I need to introduce new experiences to B'Elanna. She needs to see that taking me as a mate would be good for her personal development.</I></P>
