<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 9: A Good Deed Rewarded -->

<p>Josie heard her approaching. Moving from her cover in the trees,
		she reached the young woman and took the reins of the heavily laden horse from her hand.
		She counted the sacks of grain and salt pork, and realized that there was quite a bit more
		than she had expected. </p>

		<p>"Where did you get all this? This is twice what I asked
		for." </p>

		<p>"They wanted you to have it as their way of saying
		thanks."</p>

		<p>"You're lying." The blue eyes narrowed as her hand
		reached for her sidearm. Rebecca's eyes went wide with fear.</p>

		<p>"N-no, I swear. They wanted me to take some money and other
		supplies, but I thought you would be mad, so I refused. I told them that all you wanted
		was the oats and pork, so they insisted on giving more than the original agreement,"
		Rebecca said as she silently prayed that the outlaw would believe her.</p>

		<p>Josie searched the face in the pale moonlight. As always, there
		was no hint of deception or betrayal. "Did anyone follow you?"</p>

		<p>"No. I left town heading east, then doubled back."</p>

		<p>"Good." Josie removed the supplies from the back of the
		horse and opened one of the sacks of grain. She filled a feed bag for her mare, and put a
		heap on the ground for the little horse who worked so hard to carry it. With her back
		turned, the outlaw couldn't see the beaming smile on the young woman's face.</p>

		<p>"Josie?" Rebecca asked as she settled into her bedroll.</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"I'm glad you didn't get hurt today. That was a very brave
		thing you did."</p>

		<p>"All I did was shoot a man who deserved it," Josie said
		dismissing it.</p>

		<p>"No." Rebecca sat up and looked across the fire at the
		tall woman. "Today you did the right thing. You stood up with people that you didn't
		know and protected them from a gang of outlaws bent on destroying their town. Josie, if
		you hadn't left, they would have told you themselves how thankful they were."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's not that simple."</p>

		<p>"Yes...it is just that simple, Josie. Today you did the
		right thing. How long has it been since you've done that? Each day it will get a little
		easier."</p>

		<p>"Go to sleep...before I shoot you." Josie growled as
		she rolled away from the fire.</p>

		<p>"Good night Josie," she said softly before laying back
		down. She refused to take the gruff threat as anything more than her newfound friend being
		grouchy.</p>
