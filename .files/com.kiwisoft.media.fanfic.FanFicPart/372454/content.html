The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 6 by patricia51<p>(Note: This chapter is rated "M" for sexual situations between two girls.)<p>The following morning when Alex woke up she kept her eyes shut at first. In the back of her mind was the idea that the last few days had been a dream. It was a wonderful dream but a dream never-the-less. Finally she couldn't stand it any longer. She peeked with her right eye barely open and the left one closed.<p>Then they both were open and she was marveling at the sight of Juliet still asleep in the bed next to her. The long brown hair spilled over the pillow and hid most of the teen vampire's face. But it was her. It wasn't a dream.<p>Alex felt so good she positively wiggled in joy on the bed. The slight noises the bed frame made must have been loud enough for a giggle came from the other bed.<p>"If you wake up like that all the time I'm going to have a hard time keeping to the boundaries your parents set for us. Has no one told you just how yummy you look when you do that?"<p>"I don't think so," replied Alex, pretending to thoughtfully consider the idea. "But feel free to tell me that whenever you feel like it."<p>Juliet laughed aloud this time. She flung the covers back and sprang from the bed. Wearing, like Alex, no more than a t-shirt that only covered her to mid-thigh and a pair of panties her legs flashed as she came across the room. Alex marveled once again at the incredible grace the other girl demonstrated, as well as just how lovely those legs were. She swung her own legs out of her bed and jumped up just in time to wrap her girlfriend up in her arms and kiss her as Juliet reached her bed.<p>The two girls exchanged quick sweet kisses for a few moments, Then their mouths opened to each other. Alex plastered herself against Juliet, shivering in delight at the hidden strength the teen vampire possessed. Then she shivered even more as a set of dancing fingers crept under the hem of her t-shirt and slipped up to brush over her bottom.<p>"Stop that Juliet," Alex whispered fiercely, even as she pressed her bottom against the palm that now cupped her butt.<p>"Or what?" teased Juliet as she gently rubbed her girl's firm tight butt.<p>Alex really jumped as Juliet's index finger slid along the crease of her butt where her panties had ridden up. "Or we'll be in SO much trouble when someone comes in to find us in bed together."<p>Juliet sighed and released her wizardess. "You re right. It would be really bad of me to act like this when your parents have been so good to me. But you know," her eyes twinkled. "You just being you makes it very hard to behave."<p>Alex got the mischief in her eyes that Juliet had already noticed was a constant companion. "Just remember, they said 'separate beds'. Nothing was said about any other place."<p>Before the girls could pursue those thoughts any further a yell came from downstairs as Justin summoned them to breakfast.<p>The rest of the week passed quickly and happily. Alex went to school and Juliet helped Mrs. Russo out around the house and at the Sub Station. Jerry's friend had built shutters that kept the direct sunlight out of the house and the sandwich shop both when needed for Juliet's safety. The two girls and Theresa went shopping and picked out Juliet several outfits. The teen vampire got Alex to go with her to the blood bank on Saturday to perform her usual volunteer duties. Unspoken but understood was the realization that Juliet would get enough blood to sustain herself.<p>To her own vast surprise Alex found herself donating blood. The dark haired girl had always figured "I need all of my blood for myself" as well as a healthy distaste for having needles stuck in her. But this was for Juliet. In a way, of course. Her vampire girlfriend told her it wouldn't be a good idea for her to get used to drinking Alex's blood.<p>"Might make you too tempting."<p>Alex wanted to make some flip remark about wanting to be as tempting as she could for her but there was a seriousness in Juliet's voice that made her reconsider.<p>Sunday dawned bright and clear. With the Sub station closed the various Russo members slowly scattered to the winds. Max headed off to the movies with a friend. Justin went to meet with an old girlfriend he had recently reconnected with. The older Russos decided to go out for a meal that neither of them made themselves.<p>Alex and Juliet spent the day in the Magic Lair. Juliet was fascinated by everything and amazed at how much her girlfriend had to learn and practice. Alex told her about WizTech and they discussed f there was some way for Alex to smuggle the young vampire there.<p>As they talked and talked the pair of girls drew closer to each other. A touch here, a brush of fingers there and before long the pair was simply standing and looking at each other.<p>"There's no bed here," said Alex with a husky catch in her throat.<p>"You don't always need one," agreed the other girl. The light that always burned in their eyes when their gazes met flared to brilliance.<p>Juliet flowed up to Alex and kissed her. Without even thinking the young wizardess opened her mouth and kissed the other girl back. The kiss was sweet and soft but the passion between them made her head spin.<p>The girl vampire stepped back. She reached down and in one fluid motion pulled her dress over her head and tossed it aside, revealing she had nothing on under the dress. Now clad only in her soft slip-on shoes she came back to Alex and kissed her again. Fingers danced over Alex's body, loosening buttons, undoing ties and clasps, tugging and pulling clothing free. The kiss broke once for a moment as Juliet pulled Alex's top off and then again for a bit longer as the long haired teen knelt to tug off Alex's boots and jeans.<p>Alex frantically kicked and wiggled as her clothes came off. She caught Juliet on the rise and pulled her in. Now the kisses were wild and the bare bodies molded together and young arms strained to eliminate even a millimeter of space between them.<p>Juliet's lips slipped from Alex's. Kisses rained over her face and then along her bare shoulder. A deep thrill shot through Alex as the other girl nuzzled her neck, a thrill that was a mixture of fear and excitement.<p>"You're shaking Alex," whispered Juliet. "Why? What do you think might happen?" Alex gasped and shivered as she felt two sharp points press against her neck. Her heart was beating so hard she could feel the pulsations of her artery right under Juliet's lips.<p>"Do you think I might bite you?" The girl vampire pressed harder, nearly breaking the skin. Alex couldn't breath but instead of pulling away she craned her head slightly as though she was offering her neck to Juliet. "You couldn't stop me. You can't use a spell in time. Just a little harder and you'll be Alex Russo, mid-day snack."<p>In spite of her arousal, in spite of the dark excitement that the moment was producing the idea of "Mid-day snack" caught Alex off guard and she started to giggle. She felt Juliet shaking and for a moment she was scared she had either hurt the girl vampire's feelings or angered her before she realized that the other girl was giggling herself.<p>"Oh Alex, I'm sorry." Juliet lifted her face from Alex's neck. Laughter danced in her eyes and spilled from her lips. "I just couldn't resist getting all dark and well, vampire on you."<p>"You really had me going! It was terrifying and exhilarating and yet deep inside I felt perfectly safe," Alex admitted.<p>"You are. I would never bite you. At least not like THAT." Alex stiffened as Juliet's hands covered her breasts, the palms rubbing lazily in flat round circles. "But now I'm crushed. You said I 'had you going'. What should I do to get you going again?"<p>"I think what you are doing right now is getting me going so much my head is spinning." Alex's nipples felt like diamond points under the touch of her girlfriend. Juliet brought her head to the right one and licked gently, then more aggressively as Alex ran her fingers through her girlfriend's hair. Juliet darted back and forth, using her tongue to wet the hard nubbins and her regular teeth to graze them.<p>"Juliet," whispered Alex. "Please."<p>"Please?" returned the other teen. "Please what?"<p>Even as she said that Juliet's knees gave way. Her lips danced down over Alex's firm tummy, pausing to explore the navel set in the middle of the now quivering belly. Then Juliet was fully on her knees and her mouth and tongue closed in on Alex's near dripping sex.<p>Alex looked down. Juliet's long brown hair spilled nearly to the floor as her head bobbed gently up and down, stroking Alex's wetness with her tongue. She stroked that beautiful hair, even as she felt her body building. her body squirmed, her hips rocking to Juliet's ministrations. She felt the other girl's tongue move up and find her pearl, now exposed and hard as its namesake.<p>"Alex?" came a whisper from between her legs.<p>"Yes?"<p>"NOW I'm going to bite you."<p>Before the words even registered one of Juliet's fangs closed on her already throbbing pea and bit down. The girl vampire almost broke the skin but stopped a bare ounce of pressure away from that. A quick shake of her head and Alex went off like a rocket. Her fingers clenched Juliet's hair so tightly she feared it was hurting the other girl but she couldn't let go. Alex bucked, she arched, she screamed in delight.<p>It seemed to take forever for Alex to catch her breath. She could feel Juliet's tongue greedily lapping at the flood she was producing. Finally Alex sagged back against the wall and her eyes managed to focus. She looked down again.<p>Juliet was sitting back on her folded legs. Her eyes were fixed on Alex. One hand cupped her right breast while the other one was plunged between her legs. One finger had joined her thumb in pinching the pink tip of her breast. Two on her other hand had disappeared inside of her. The teen vampire's chest was heaving with unneeded breaths as she built to her own climax. She shuddered and sank back on her heels.<p>"Wow." gasped Alex<p>"Wow indeed," replied Juliet as she climbed up on to unsteady legs. She giggled. "It's a good thing I don't need to breath. You might have smothered me."<p>Alex kissed her girlfriend. "Another advantage of being a vampire."<p>Juliet snuggled against Alex, resting her head on the other girl's shoulder. "There are some," she admitted. "But they balance against other things."<p>Alex sensed some deep longings in Juliet but wisely decided not to follow up on what those might be, at least not now. Instead they scrambled to get dressed before anyone came home, which proved to be a good idea as Alex's parents showed up about 30 minutes later. By then the two girls were sprawled on the couch watching MTV.<p>After dinner the entire family relaxed together in the kitchen and shared what they had done over the day. Wisely, Alex and Juliet summarized their visit to the Magic Lair without revealing quite everything that had gone on. And if anyone noticed that they were sitting closer together and holding hands there was no comment except for a smile and approving nod from a smiling Justin.<p>Max's scene by scene description of the movie he had gone to was interrupted, to everyone else's immense if hidden relief, by a knock on the door. Jerry answered it. Everyone looked and the conversation fell silent. Finally Juliet stood up.<p>"Mother. Father."<p>(To Be Continued)
