<!-- Complete \ Part 2 -->

<P>B’Elanna Torres worked almost continually on the project for the next two weeks. Every spare moment not taken by Engineering had her pondering over bio-neural circuitry, gel-pack design and electrical transference data. Most of the work was done in the holodeck to minimise the damage to parts Voyager could ill afford to lose.</p>
<P>It was also time shared with Seven of Nine. Seven worked closely alongside B’Elanna, often explaining the finer aspects of Borg design and technology and how it could be related to Federation or, more often, Federation-B’Elanna Torres’ hybrid technology. They would extrapolate data and conclusions together, bouncing ideas and solutions off each other, making rapid advancements.</P>
<P>Tom, who felt neglected and ignored for the second time in two relationships, would interrupt them frequently during their work. Seven would take her leave on occasion in order to spend time with him but found the intrusion on their work schedule frustrating, particularly if Tom used a ruse to extract her from the holodeck.</p>
<P>She found herself voicing her feelings to B’Elanna one afternoon after Tom had pried her from the holodeck on the pretence that Mizati was ill - only to discover that she was perfectly well but he had arranged a candle lit dinner for them to share in his quarters. He then accused her of selfishness when she failed to warm to his surprise. It was their first argument.</P>
<P>"I told him that his behaviour was irrational and childish," Seven confided to the half-Klingon and looked sharply at her when she heard a barely restrained snort of laughter from the Chief Engineer. "I do not understand how this can be funny, B’Elanna", she admonished.</P>
<P>To the small brunette’s surprise, Seven pouted, causing her to throw her head back and laugh unreservedly. B’Elanna regained her composure quickly though and hurried to explain her reaction. "Seven, the first time Tom and I argued I used exactly the same words as you. He must have a sinking feeling of déjà vu now."</p>
<P>Seven’s face lit up in understanding and she grinned openly at B’Elanna. "That would explain his actions directly after I uttered those words", she stated, prompting B’Elanna to collapse into laughter again.</p>
<P>"Don’t tell me," she begged, gasping for breath, wiping away an errant tear, as she fought to regain control again. Eventually, a semblance of decorum was restored and B’Elanna leant against the workstation, arms folded and faced Seven. "So how do you feel about quarrelling with Tom then?" she asked softly.</p>
<P>Seven faltered slightly before answering. "I am unsure. I am still irritated by his actions so logically it has solved nothing, but I do nor regret my words, as I felt that my displeasure needed to be expressed. However I may have, I think the expression is, ‘dented his ego’ somewhat. I could have chosen less pointed adjectives", she reasoned objectively.</p>
<P>"Okay", replied B’Elanna slowly, "that’s the clinical dissection of the argument. How do you actually feel about what happened?" she pursued doggedly.</P>
<P>Seven opened her mouth to reply and then stopped, looking at B’Elanna miserably. "I have no feelings over the events at all B’Elanna. Perhaps it is the cortical inhibitor preventing me from getting emotional over this."</P>
<P>"It could be," the smaller woman nodded. "But it may be that you just haven’t developed deep enough feelings towards Tom to care," she articulated quietly. B’Elanna tried desperately to stop her mind from racing. She couldn’t believe she had just voiced her opinion like that. She knew her heart was crazily hoping that Seven didn’t have any sort of feelings for Tom but it was dishonourable to chase someone already committed in a relationship. She could hear her heart chastising her brain – aware of the irony in allowing her Klingon honour to guide her actions when she had for so long denied her heritage.</P>
<P>Seven allowed herself a few moments to consider B’Elanna’s point. "Am I ever likely to develop those feelings though? With anyone, not just Tom?" she wondered aloud.</p>
<P>B’Elanna closed her eyes briefly to combat the pinprick of tears she felt begin and swallowed. "I hope so Seven, I truly do. Let’s see if we can get any further with the gel packs", she suggested with a lighter voice, changing the subject to one more comfortable for the pair of them. Seven acknowledged her agreement by nodding her head curtly and B’Elanna swung her body round, examining the workstation carefully.</p>
<P>The two women continued their experiments, methodically overcoming each problem that emerged during their research. When not discussing hypotheses, they worked in a companionable silence, making extraordinary progress.</p>
<P>The chime of the holodeck door broke one of these silences. "Come in", B’Elanna yelled, without even looking up. The swish of the doors was followed by a soft footfall.</p>
<P>"I came to apologise, Seven".</p>
<P>Both women spun round to see Tom Paris holding a huge bouquet of orchids, wearing his most sincere smile. B’Elanna felt like she wanted to rip his heart out and eat it raw but she remained silent as Seven approached Tom and took the bouquet.</p>
<P>"Thank you Tom. I am unsure what to do with these flowers but I do understand that they are a symbol of reconciliation", she spoke gently.</P>
<P>"Thank you, Seven," Tom replied and put his arms round her and hugged her. B’Elanna turned back to her work, not wishing to see any more.</P>
<P>"Would you please have dinner with me?" Tom asked pleadingly. He hurriedly qualified his question. "No deception or ruse, just you and I sharing dinner in the mess hall."</p>
<P>Seven glanced at B’Elanna, hunched over a gel pack, prodding furiously at her data padd and then looked back at Tom. "Yes Tom, but this is a very special project to me. Please understand that I want to return to it after we finish."</P>
<P>Tom, knowing that it was best to quit while he was ahead, agreed willingly. "Sure thing, just don’t bolt your food". He linked his arm in Seven’s and escorted her out of the holodeck.</p>
<P>B’Elanna refused to glance at them as they left, instead allowing a solitary tear to trickle hotly down her cheek before sniffing angrily and cuffing it away.</p>
<P>Feeling that her emotions had taken enough for one day, the diminutive engineer continued alone. As soon as she saw Seven’s data she had realised that the idea was ingenious, however the more she delved into its nuances, the more she realised how radical Seven’s solution was. The basic principle was to replace the borg nano-circuitry from around the cortical inhibitor with bio-neural circuitry from a gel–pack, substitute their functions and then safely remove the inhibitor. The bio-neural circuitry to continue functioning and fool Seven’s borg systems into thinking that it was still present.</p>
<P>The largest of the many snags that they had to overcome was the adaptivity of Borg technology. Despite exhaustive analysis, B’Elanna could still not find a way to adapt the bio-neural circuitry into Seven’s systems faster than the nanoprobes could detect and reject it.</p>
<P>"Unless…" she spoke aloud, despite being alone. Suddenly, B’Elanna’s brilliant mind kicked into overdrive as a glimmer of an idea formed within its recesses. Within seconds she was totally engrossed in performing a mass of rapid calculations and tests that took her deep into the gamma shift.</P>

<P>Seven lay in Tom’s bed watching his face as he slept and wondered if she could ever really <I>feel</I> passion. She had studied the helmsman’s face as he had lain on top of her and examined her face with his fingers, before kissing her gently. She scrutinised him as his passion mounted and he kissed her harder, moving to her breasts, kissing one and massaging the other.</p>
<P>She felt his erection on her thigh before he swivelled his hips slightly, rubbing the tip along her vagina several times before finally adjusting his position and entering her slowly. He paused, looking triumphantly into her eyes as he began thrusting into her, his breathing becoming rapid. She had felt her own body respond physically to the attention. Her heart rate increased and she undulated with him. His cry as he came was euphoric and he collapsed across her in ecstatic exhaustion … but as he climaxed, she felt strangely detached from the whole experience, as if she were watching from outside her body.</p>
<P>She sighed quietly as she adjusted position slightly, gently pushing Tom away from her arm so she could restore circulation. Her bewilderment continued as she realised that her thoughts could not remain focused on the sandy haired pilot for long. Instead, she found herself examining the relationship she had with B’Elanna Torres. If ever passion and feeling could be made into a person, surely it would be someone like B’Elanna. Nothing she did was done with anything less than total commitment, so much so that she could easily become obsessed with tasks. Seven recalled how she had zealously worked on their project in the holodeck and how animated she was as she formulated ideas and solved problems.</P>
<P>Seven sat bolt upright, ignoring Tom’s mumbled annoyance at being disturbed from his resting-place. She had meant to return to the holodeck to continue with B’Elanna when Tom had convinced her to return to his quarters. Caught up in his excitement and her own curiosity, he had moved her into the bedroom. She couldn’t think of their time together as ‘making love’, as she felt so emotionless about it all but she supposed that must have been what they had done. Before Tom had drifted off to sleep he had muttered that everything would be fine once her emotions were released.</p>
<P>Perhaps he was right but Seven was not so sure. However, staying here would not assist B’Elanna so she swung her legs to the edge of the bed and scanned the room for her clothing.</P>
<P>"What’cha doin’?" Tom slurred sleepily. Seven looked down at him and answered, "I need to assist Lieutenant Torres."</P>
<P>"She’s probably in bed asleep right now honey, which is where you should be. Start again in the morning, Seven." He shifted slightly and patted the bed; his eyes still closed. "Lie down, you’re letting cold air in".</P>
<P>Seven elected to stand and move away from the bed. "I am sorry Tom, but I need to do this." Tom failed to answer having drifted back to sleep again. She stared at his still form briefly before retrieving her body suit and slipping quietly out of the helmsman’s quarters.</P>
<P>The doors to the holodeck hissed open allowing Seven to enter. She studied her colleague’s face for a while. It was the first time the ex-drone had seen a look of real peace on the dynamic engineer’s visage and the young woman was taken aback with her beauty.</p>
<P>"B’Elanna." She spoke softly to wake B’Elanna gently and then had to bite her lip to stop grinning as the half Klingon sat up with a jolt, scattering the data padds around her comically, the serenity being wiped from her face to be replaced by a look of guilty confusion.</P>
<P>"I think you may find it more comfortable to sleep in your own quarters," Seven suggested gently, allowing B’Elanna a little more time to compose herself.</P>
<P>"What time is it?" B’Elanna rubbed her eyes roughly, trying to stimulate her senses.</P>
<P>"By the ship’s chronometer, 0300 hours. I believe you need to take a break." Seven continued to keep her voice low, though she was unsure why.</P>
<P>B’Elanna, senses fully recovered, looked carefully at Seven. Her heightened Klingon senses could smell Tom’s scent on her and Seven’s slightly dishevelled appearance confirmed her worst fears. She felt totally at odds with herself. Emotionally, she didn’t think she could stand to be so close to Seven, knowing she was unattainable. Her keen engineering mind however, craved the opportunity to continue working with Seven and see the project through to conclusion. She decided to take the coward’s way out and put her mind on hold and nodded acquiescence.</P>
<P>Seven found herself escorting B’Elanna back to her quarters. She wondered why B’Elanna did not mention her late arrival but she did not voice her query. There was an easy silence between them as they strode through the dimly lit corridors, giving the women an artificial sense of the lateness of the hour.</p>
<P>When they reached their destination, B’Elanna stopped and punched her access code, permitting the doors to open. She looked up into Seven’s eyes and smiled mischievously. "I know how to beat the nano-probes," she stated quickly, before stepping through the doors.</P>
<P>Seven remained motionless as the doors swished shut and her mind reeled. She was torn between knocking on the door and discussing B’Elanna’s discovery, and letting the exhausted engineer sleep. She also suspected that the raven-haired woman had deliberated revealed the information as a parting shot to cause turmoil in Seven, though to what end, Seven had no idea.</p>
<P>Grinding on her heel in frustration, she turned and headed back to Cargo Bay 2, not wishing to disturb Tom again tonight.</P>
