<p><b>Chapter 10</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lilly exited the car and immediately looked to where Susan stood just in front of the old tree. She frowned, wondering what was going on and walked over. Susan had dialed down her derogatory comments and looks in regards to Lilly ever since the date. Maybe she had finally come to realize Lilly was serious about Miley and the excited way the younger girl had given her mom a detailed recap of the date had likely helped, too. Miley's enthusiasm was always infectious.</p>
<p>"Miley, please, come down." Susan sounded exasperated, like she'd been standing there for a while with the same lack of results. Lilly stepped up next to her, following her line of sight to the tree. She saw nothing but the rustling of some leaves. Then one of the branches seemed to move and more leaves shook, going higher and higher.</p>
<p>"Miley Ray Stewart, I told you not to go that high. Get down here right now!"</p>
<p>Lilly glanced at the woman. "What happened?"</p>
<p>Susan turned to her as if noticing her for the first time and sighed. "Burt, her favorite chicken, died this morning. She's been up there ever since."</p>
<p>Lilly frowned. "Burt? Isn't that the one that bit her?"</p>
<p>Susan chuckled at that and shook her head. "They had a love-hate relationship, one might say." They were silent for a while, just watching the tree. When the woman spoke again, her voice was sad and Lilly knew immediately she was sharing something important. "Miley doesn't deal with death all that well…I mean, once she does, she puts it well behind her, but until then…she's like this. She's just lost so much…"</p>
<p>Lilly noticed the tears filling the woman's eyes and swallowed hard. "She told me about her dad…and her brother…I'm really sorry."</p>
<p>Susan nodded. "That was hardest on her, on all of us. Just a year before that, her Mamaw and Papaw, my husband's parents, died within a few months of each other. My father died when she was a little girl. Now Burt…I know it sounds silly…it's just a chicken…but it means a lot more to Miley."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, sadness blanketing her. She wanted to hug Miley and never let her go. She looked at Susan by her side. "Do you mind if I try?"</p>
<p>"Knock yourself out."</p>
<p>Lilly's hands were sweaty, though she didn't know why she was suddenly so nervous. She wiped them on her pants, as she stepped underneath the tree. Even from there she could not see Miley and realized with a shock how high she must actually be.</p>
<p>"Come on, road kill, I came all the way out here to see you and now you're not here. I'm gonna have to hang out with your mom and grandma."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't want to guilt Miley into coming down, especially knowing the circumstances, and she hoped the brunette knew she wasn't seriously upset over this. There was some rustling and Lilly thought she caught a flash of blue moving between the branches. Branches shook, as Miley seemed to climb between them and then stopped again. Lilly looked up, trying not to let the shock show on her face. Miley was wedged between two branches, at least fifteen feet high. At least she had come down some, Lilly thought.</p>
<p>"Lilly?" The girl's voice was barely audible by the time it reached the ground, but Lilly looked up, hoping Miley could see her face.</p>
<p>"It's me, Miles. Are you gonna come down?"</p>
<p>There was silence for a while, before the leaves rustled again. "Okay."</p>
<p>Lilly almost hadn't heard her, but Miley began moving and swiftly making her way down the branches. She'd come down a good way, only a few yards off the ground, when Lilly heard something snap. The leaves swooshed and Miley landed on the ground with a thud. Lilly rushed over in near panic, her knees hitting the dirt next to her friend. Miley let out a low groan and turned over onto her back. When she saw Lilly she smiled, though today there was an inherent sadness in her eyes that Lilly wished she could erase.</p>
<p>"Holy shit, Miley, are you okay?" Her heart had shot into her throat seeing her friend fall and it was still thundering rapidly. Her hands reached out unconsciously to brush some dirt and leaves from Miley's shirt and pants, stopping just before they reached her hair. Lilly gently picked out a few leaves from Miley's curls, intensely aware of the blue eyes watching her.</p>
<p>"It's alright. Just a bruise. I'm glad you came," said Miley and sat up, only wincing slightly as she did. She stared into Lilly's eyes and leaned forward, pressing her lips to the blonde's. Miley was a soft kisser, without hurry, and though Lilly might normally have been frustrated by that, she couldn't imagine it any other way now. Miley pulled back, smiling lightly.</p>
<p>"I like being able to do that whenever I want. I can do that whenever I want, right?"</p>
<p>The way her face scrunched up at the end made Lilly chuckle. "<b>Whenever</b> you want."</p>
<p>Another voice interrupted them and Lilly remembered they hadn't been alone. She flushed bright red. "Miley, could you maybe wait to do that when I'm not around?"</p>
<p>Miley seemed to not be embarrassed in the least bit, but stood and gave her mother a sheepish look as she walked over to the woman. "Sorry, momma."</p>
<p>Susan, happy just to have her daughter out of the tree, wrapped an arm around her and hugged her tightly. Lilly walked up to them, though stood off to the side. Susan threw her something akin to a grateful look and pulled away from her daughter, an arm still around the girl's shoulders. She moved them towards the house.</p>
<p>"Momma, can we have a funeral for Burt?" asked Miley quietly.</p>
<p>"Of course we can, sweet pea. Whenever you're ready."</p>
<p>Miley nodded resolutel., "I wanna build a box first. And can we do it under the tree? Burt would have liked the tree."</p>
<p>"Whatever you want," said Susan, opening the door to usher Miley inside. She noticed Lilly standing a little farther away, looking unsure and motioned for the girl to come in. "Lilly, maybe you and Miley would like to watch a movie or something. I've got to go to work in a few."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't hesitate to follow them into the house. She knew there was nothing anyone could say to keep her away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"Lilly? Where are you going dressed like that?"</p>
<p>Lilly stopped just short of the door and turned to face her mother. The woman was looking at her skeptically and Lilly tried to put on a neutral face. "I'm going to Miley's."</p>
<p>Heather Truscott nodded, but the skepticism didn't vanish from her face. "Then why do you look like you're going to a funeral?"</p>
<p>Lilly made a face, wondering if she ought to tell her mother the truth. She decided it might the best course of action, if she didn't want the woman to think she was insane for wearing all black in the middle of the summer heat. "Uh…Miley's favorite chicken died."</p>
<p>"Please tell me you're joking," said Heather, staring blankly at her daughter. When Lilly didn't respond, the woman exhaled heavily. "You're not joking."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't think there was anything she could say and merely shrugged. Heather came closer, sighing. "I swear, if your father wasn't so damned excited about his new job, I would've already moved us all back."</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged again; she couldn't exactly argue with that, though now that she had found Miley, things were different. Heather stopped in front of her daughter, plucking at some invisible lint on the girl's shirt. "So, when do we get to finally meet Miley?"</p>
<p>"You've met her," said Lilly hesitantly, not liking where this was going.</p>
<p>"For about five seconds before you ran out of the house, yes. Why don't you invite her over for dinner sometime?"</p>
<p>"Uh…yeah."</p>
<p>Heather sighed. "We'd just like to know who's got you so excited. And that you're not going to get hurt."</p>
<p>Lilly stopped, narrowing her eyes at her mother. Her words were suspicious. "Mother, what have you heard?"</p>
<p>"What makes you ask that?" The woman sounded too innocent.</p>
<p>"Because why would you say that?"</p>
<p>Heather grimaced and relented. "I've heard some things around town, snippets really. No one's said anything concrete to me about her, but I was a little worried."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, angry now. "Well, there is nothing wrong with Miley; she's absolutely sweet and adorable. People in this town are just crazy."</p>
<p>"Well, I can't argue with that," said Heather, not too thrilled to have left her normal life in California for this small town. "But why would they hate a teenaged girl?"</p>
<p>"Who knows, maybe they have nothing better to do?" Lilly wanted to leave, to get out of this conversation and so as not to miss Burt's funeral.</p>
<p>Her mother shook her head. "Still, there's something strange about all this. What happened to make them act this way?"</p>
<p>Lilly suppressed a groan, though she had asked herself that same question multiple times. "I don't know, no one tells me anything. Can I go now? I'm gonna be late to the funeral."</p>
<p>Heather grimaced at the reminder of a chicken having a funeral, but nodded. Before Lilly could leave, however, she called after her. "But we still want to meet her."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah," huffed Lilly, exiting out the door.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>They sat in the shade of Miley's favorite tree, enjoying the weather and each other. Lilly was leaning back against the trunk of the tree, while Miley sat beside her with one leg thrown across Lilly's. Miley was writing on her jeans with a pen and Lilly wondered whether she was going to get in trouble, again. Miley sat almost sideways against her so half of her upper body was pressed against Lilly, who couldn't help but be affected by it. She had never felt such a need for someone before, while at the same time being completely willing to take things slow. She no longer understood herself.</p>
<p>Miley stopped her writing and looked up. Lilly glanced at her pants. The letters MS and LT were contained within a little heart. It was horribly cheesy and Lilly laughed. She met the other girl's blue eyes and Miley smiled softly. "I made you something…for your birthday."</p>
<p>Lilly wasn't sure whether she should be worried, but Miley was already fumbling in her pocket. She pulled out the object and held it up for Lilly to see. It looked like a wristband, woven pieces of differently colored string, leather and what seemed to be feathers. Lilly took it hesitantly and noticed for the first time Miley seemed almost shy. She looked at Lilly, smiling. "It's a good luck charm."</p>
<p>Lilly turned the band over in her hand, looking at the intricate woven pattern. It was really quite beautiful and she felt touched Miley had gone through the trouble of making something for her, instead of just buying something random. When she hadn't said anything in a while, Miley shifted nervously. "I'm sorry I didn't get you something better, but…"</p>
<p>She was cut off with a soft kiss and when Lilly pulled back, Miley was smiling again. "No, I love it, Miles. It's really amazing. Thanks, road kill."</p>
<p>She put the band around her wrist, holding it out in front of her to admire it. Lilly reached down and took Miley's hand in hers, intertwining their fingers. She could sit here forever, she knew, under this tree, with this girl. Never in a million years would she have expected finding contentment in Tennessee. She looked down at her wristband, turning it back and forth.</p>
<p>"These aren't Burt's feathers, are they?" She didn't want to sound ungrateful, but she was a bit apprehensive about wearing chicken feathers. Though the look on her mom's face when she told her might be worth it.</p>
<p>Miley snorted. "No…Burt was a chicken. That's one of Mike's feathers. I told him what I was making for you and he let me have one."</p>
<p>Lilly looked at her, skeptical. "And who is Mike?"</p>
<p>"Our peacock."</p>
<p>"You have a peacock. Named Mike. And you talk to him." Lilly didn't want to sound condescending; she thought the whole thing was rather funny. Miley was so earnest about everything, it was hard to judge the things she said.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "He wanders around a lot. But he's really pretty. Normally, he drops his feathers where I can't find them, except that one…so I figured he was giving it to me."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, amusement clearly evident on her face. She leaned forward and pressed her lips to Miley's again. The contact lasted a bit longer this time and she pulled away all too reluctantly, placing another quick peck on the girl's nose. Miley's eyes fluttered open and she smiled and Lilly couldn't believe how incredibly happy she felt just staring at her. It felt like she was falling in love. Lilly nearly choked at the thought.</p>
<p>"I wish I could go to your party tomorrow," said Miley, using her pen to draw on Lilly's arm.</p>
<p>Lilly suddenly felt immense guilt eat at her again. Her mother had practically forced her to throw a birthday party, despite Lilly's pleading to the contrary. She had a feeling her mother was worried she was being too isolated in this town and was trying to force a social life upon her. Lilly had given in, just to stop the argument, and had asked Oliver to invite people, saving her the trouble from asking people she didn't know. But all she had been able to think about was that Miley would not be able to come to her birthday party.</p>
<p>"Miley…" She didn't know what to say, but Lilly had half a mind to invite the girl anyway – everyone else be damned.</p>
<p>But Miley merely sighed, almost theatrically. "I'm gonna be grounded, again."</p>
<p>Lilly frowned. "What did you do this time?"</p>
<p>Miley looked up, her regular grin firmly in place. "I painted some of the chickens blue."</p>
<p>Lilly looked at her weirdly and shook her head. That girl truly was a handful. Lilly wondered, though, whether Miley had done it intentionally to get grounded and have an excuse for not going to Lilly's birthday party. They both knew why she couldn't go, though Lilly knew decidedly less about why exactly that was. In a way it would be less painful this way. She sighed, wrapping an arm around Miley's shoulders and pressed a wet kiss to her cheek. Miley laughed, still not done with her masterpiece on Lilly's arm.</p>
<p>Looking at the girl snuggled into her side, who could be so happy despite all the crap she had to deal with, who was excited about the simplest things, who did what felt right, who made her feel more alive than she had in a long time, Lilly knew what she wanted. They'd only been on a few dates, mainly because of Miley's strict mother and because Lilly refused to call anything that involved said mother a date, but it didn't matter. She wanted Miley to be her girlfriend, everyone else be damned. She tried to gather up the courage to ask the question.</p>
<p>"Miley…" started Lilly then stopped. She suddenly felt nervous, though she knew without a doubt she had nothing to fear. Miley looked at her and Lilly cleared her throat.</p>
<p>Miley sat up abruptly, turning to Lilly with a sparkle in her eyes. She seemed excited about something and Lilly was only too willing to let her go ahead, giving herself a temporary reprieve. "Lilly, can I be your girlfriend?"</p>
<p>Lilly's mouth opened and closed and for a moment she was too stunned for words. Then she groaned. "Miles, you are impossible, you know that?"</p>
<p>Miley frowned. "So I can't be?"</p>
<p>"No…yes…I mean…ugh…it's just that I was about to ask you the same thing."</p>
<p>Miley furrowed her brow, confused. "So, I'm your girlfriend then?"</p>
<p>Lilly laughed, her nervousness vanquished, and she leaned over to kiss Miley lightly. "Yes, you're my girlfriend."</p>
<p>Miley smiled and Lilly pushed her gently onto her back, propping herself up on top of her. She leaned down and their lips met gently. Their kisses had never gone beyond slow and soft, though there certainly wasn't a lack of passion. Lilly figured that was just the way Miley was, soft and gentle, slow and laidback, intense and real. Miley's arms wrapped around her neck, pulling her closer. Lilly lost herself in the feel of her girlfriend's lips.</p>
