<!-- Gremlins \ Part Three -->

<p>They arrived early in the afternoon. Onlet was a
prosperous little town so it offered a variety of places to stay. Xena, decided that they
needed to be as comfortable as possible if the bard was going to relax and get better so
they took lodging in the finest inn in the village. Gabrielle didn't understand it, but
she wasn't about to argue with the warrior. They had plenty of dinars at the moment and
the thoughts of being pampered for a few days didn't seem to upset her delicate
constitution. Xena escorted her to their room and then left to stable Argo, telling the
bard to relax and that she would be back shortly.</p>

<p>Gabrielle gently put her scroll bag on the bed
and stretched out to rest for a few moments. Long ears crawled out of the bag, stretched,
rubbed his little eyes and happily bounded across the bed and climbed up into the bard's
lap. He walked up her body and then took a seat right between her breasts. She peered down
her nose at him. &quot;Better not let Xena catch you sitting there,&quot; She said with a
chuckle. &quot;She's the jealous type you know.&quot; Long ears sighed again and rested
his head in his hands, looking completely bored.</p>

<p>When the door to the room opened again, long ears
scrambled the rest of the way up the bard's body and ducked behind her shoulder burying
himself between her and the pillow. Gabrielle giggled, his movements tickled the skin on
her neck. </p>

<p>Xena looked over and smiled. &quot;What's so
funny?&quot; She asked as she closed the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh nothing.&quot; Gabrielle said as she
swatted gently at the back of her neck. &quot;I've just got an itch I can't really
reach.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior grinned a wicked little grin as she
unhooked her sheath and laid it on the table. &quot;I bet I could help you scratch that
itch.&quot; She laid the chakram down next to the sword and headed for the bed.</p>

<p>Gabrielle still fishing behind her for long ears
knew she had to stall. &quot;Xena, the armor?&quot; </p>

<p>Xena paused and considered her armor and began
removing it as well. Gabrielle knew she had bought herself a few more minutes and she
continued to try and find the little gremlin without trying to appear conspicuous. Every
time Xena would look her direction she would stop her searching and just smile.</p>

<p>With the armor removed, Xena stretched out on the
bed next to Gabrielle. She leaned into the bard and gently began kissing her neck and ear.
Gabrielle's breath caught in her chest, partly from her lover&#146;s touch and partly from
the fact that she knew somewhere behind her there was a little sharp toothed gremlin just
waiting for an opportunity. Needless to say the bard was finding extremely difficult to
concentrate.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah Xena...&quot; She said softy.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmm.&quot; The warrior replied never
removing herself from the bard's neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you think...&quot; Her words were cut
short when Xena hit 'the spot'. &quot;Oh Gods.&quot; The bard moaned, then regaining her
senses she cleared her throat and tried again. &quot;Xena...wait a...&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior pulled back and looked at the bard.
&quot;Something wrong Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>The bard wanted to say no, but the fact that long
ears was now tangled in the warrior's long dark hair made speech completely impossible.
The absurdity of the situation almost made her want to cry. She put a gentle hand on
Xena's cheek and caressed it softly, slowly inching her way toward the little prisoner
that the warrior princess was completely unaware that she had even captured.</p>

<p>&quot;Well Gabrielle is there a problem?&quot;
Xena asked, the mood slowly dissipating.</p>

<p>&quot;No sweetheart of course not.&quot;
Gabrielle said as tried to free the little troublemaker. She knew this wasn't going to be
easy. She stroked the warrior's hair trying desperately not to cause injury to any of the
affected parties soon she realized that it just wasn't going to be possible and with a
quick yank she pulled long ears loose and reached across the bed jamming him under the
scroll bag.</p>

<p>Xena sat up quickly as if she had just been
stabbed and put her hand to the side of her head. &quot;Gabrielle what in Zeus' name has
gotten into you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gray hair?&quot; The bard offered smiling
meekly at the fuming warrior.</p>

<p>&quot;Well with the way you've been acting today
it's no damned wonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry love.&quot; Gabrielle said as she
reached out and pulled Xena back to her. &quot;I really am.&quot; She offered a couple of
well placed little kisses to the warrior's temple. &quot;Now where were we?&quot; She
whispered into her ear as seductively as possible while trying to keep one eye on the bag.
She watched as he crawled in the bag and settled down.</p>

<p>Xena softened and began planting little kisses
along the bard's jawline. Gabrielle fairly secure in the knowledge that her little friend
was once again safely tucked away in the bag relaxed and began to enjoy the moment. Xena's
lips were so soft and felt so good...</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and allowed herself to be
wrapped into her lover&#146;s warm embrace. Xena was so tender, so passionate with her it
was easy to give in to her warrior. The bard would deny her nothing. Her head fell back
and the flesh of her neck was exposed to the warrior&#146;s warm soft kisses. Xena wasted
no time accepting the invitation. The bard moaned. The warrior moaned. The scroll bag
rustled...</p>

<p>As the lovers spread out onto the bed, Xena's
hand came in contact with the scroll bag, which in her opinion was taking up far to much
space on the bed. She grabbed it by the strap and tossed it over her back it hit the wall
and slid to the floor. Gabrielle heard the soft thump of the leather hitting the floor.
The bard jerked her head quickly towards the sound. As she moved she managed to bring her
chin in contact with the warrior's nose. The crunch<i> </i>of the cartilage breaking was
unmistakable. Gabrielle froze and bit down on her lip. Xena pulled back and brought her
hand up to her nose, which was broken and bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle!&quot; She was still a little
shocked as the blood began to pour through her fingers. She sat up on the edge of the bed
and tried to stop the flow by tilting her head back. It had never worked on anyone she had
ever known, but at this point any port in a storm... </p>

<p>&quot;Oh Gods!&quot; The bard was up in an
instant and searching for something to stop the flow of blood. Unable to find anything she
was happy with, she grabbed a pillow from the bed and started to approach the warrior.</p>

<p>Xena looked to her left as she saw movement. When
she realized the bard was coming at her with the pillow, she was on her feet backing up.
&quot;Gabrielle I'm already having trouble breathing if you do that I'll suffocate.&quot;</p>

<p>The bard looked down at her hands and ripped the
cover from the pillow and moved towards Xena.</p>

<p>&quot;Stay there!&quot; The warrior ordered.
&quot;Just toss it over to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked at Xena and took a step towards
her. Xena took a step back. &quot;I'm serious Gabrielle, just toss me the cloth.&quot;</p>

<p>The warrior's blood was snaking its way down her
arm now and the bard wanted to cry as she tossed the cloth to Xena. She watched as the
warrior finally managed to get the flow under control. She tried again to approach, but
Xena just motioned for her to back up. She did as she was silently instructed. She finally
had backed into the bed. She got back up on it and sat with her legs curled up under her.
Xena kept a wary eye on the bard as she took a seat at the table near the fireplace.</p>

<p>Gabrielle sat in silence as she watched the
warrior finally control and stop the flow of blood from her broken nose. She watched as
Xena wiped the blood from her face and arm and taking a deep breath she placed both hands
on either side of her nose and put it back in place. Gabrielle cringed at the sound of the
cartilage once again shifting. Xena drew a deep breath through her mouth and sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena I'm so sorry...&quot; The bard
whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay. I'll be fine. What was that all
about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My scroll bag...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your scroll bag? You must be kidding!&quot;
</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah when you threw it across the room I
got concerned...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Concerned about what Gabrielle? That the
parchment might crinkle?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle eased herself off the bed and poured
water from a pitcher into a bowl. &quot;It's not important now.&quot; She slowly
approached Xena and knelt in front of her setting the bowl on the table. &quot;Let me get
you cleaned up.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena handed her the cloth. Gabrielle tore it up
and took the cleaner sections and dipped them in the water. She wrung out the cloth and
started with the warrior's arm, washing it clean of the blood. Then she carefully moved to
her face and washed the blood away. Both of Xena's eyes were already starting to turn
black and her nose was swollen. She flinched as Gabrielle wiped the blood away from her
upper lip and mouth. The bard's hand shook slightly as she washed the warrior's face. </p>

<p>&quot;I really am sorry.&quot; She said as she
made the final pass across her face.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay. I'll heal. It's just the first
time I've every had my nose broken. It's a little disorienting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean to tell me that in all of you
battles, with all of your wounds ...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right Gabrielle I've never broken my
nose. Always protect the face.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You really know how to make a bad situation
worse. I don't know what to say.&quot; Gabrielle said as she moved away and stood by the
window looking out.</p>

<p>Now Xena felt like a heel. She stood and crossed
to the bard and put her hands on her shoulders. &quot;It's okay really. Listen why don't
you get out and go shopping or something. The fresh air will do you some good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. Why don't we go downstairs and have
a drink. It'll make you feel better.&quot; Gabrielle said.</p>

<p>&quot;Well I don't know about better, but if I
have enough to drink maybe I just won't feel it.&quot; She tried to smile, but it hurt too
much. </p>

<p>They left their room, but not before Gabrielle
retrieved her scroll bag. She slipped her hand inside and felt long ears in the bottom of
the bag. She didn't know if he was okay or not, but she'd have to find away to find out.</p>

<p>They settled into a corner table. The shadows hid
the bruised face of the warrior princess from the other patrons. The innkeeper came to
their table and waited for an order. Gabrielle took a deep breath and ordered ale for Xena
and wine for herself as Xena kept her face down, with her forehead settled in the valley
of her hand between her thumb and forefinger. She turned her head slightly to the bard.</p>

<p>&quot;Wine? At this time of day? Gabrielle do you
think that&#146;s a good idea?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After the day that we&#146;ve had it&#146;s
a perfectly good idea.&quot; She smiled and laid her hand on Xena&#146;s knee.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay I gotta give you that. It&#146;s been
an unusual day to say the least.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah it has and I&#146;m really
sorry.&quot; She said softly as she rubbed the knee that her hand rested on.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s okay. It&#146;s as much my fault
as it is yours. I never should have teased you last night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I like it when you&#146;re
playful&#133;&quot; She was about to say something else when she felt little gremlin hands
on the top of her boot. She jerked her leg suddenly and heard a little gremlin thump as
long ears fell to the floor.</p>

<p>Xena raised an eyebrow. The bard smiled. Long
ears ran across the floor of the inn, directly for the table of a rather large imposing
mountain of a man who didn&#146;t look like he would enjoy the company of a gremlin any
more than a certain warrior princess. Gabrielle held her breath as she tried to figure out
what her next move should be. She watched as the little troublemaker climbed up the large
man&#146;s pants leg, up his shirt and finally onto the table. To her absolute horror he
then climbed up the man&#146;s ale mug and dunked his head in.</p>

<p>&quot;Great, just great&#133;&quot; She mumbled
softly.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; Xena asked as the innkeeper
delivered their drinks.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh nothing. I&#146;m just&#133;&quot; Her
words stopped as she watched long ears fall from the edge of the mug and tumble off the
table. He picked himself up and staggered back towards their table. She turned to Xena a
smiled weakly. </p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle what&#146;s wrong?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&#133;uh&#133;.nothing.&quot; She could
feel him climbing back up her boot. She leaned over, pretending to scratch her leg and
lifted him into her lap. She looked down, he smiled and hiccuped. &quot;Behave.&quot; She
warned him quietly.</p>

<p>Xena watched as she sipped her ale. Gabrielle was
talking to her &#145;little friend&#146; again. She sighed and she sat the mug down.</p>

<p>&quot;You okay?&quot; Gabrielle asked as she took
the warrior&#146;s hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I&#146;m fine.&quot; She said as she
brushed her thumb over Gabrielle&#146;s hand. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never better. It&#146;ll be nice to sleep
in a nice warm bed tonight. It&#146;s getting a little chilly at night for sleeping
outside.&quot; Gabrielle realized that she was making the most ridiculous small talk.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah it will.&quot; Xena was doing it
too. She simply didn&#146;t know what to say. How do you tell your best friend, the love
of your life that you think she&#146;s lost her mind? The warrior decided that she
wasn&#146;t going to go there. If Gabrielle were completely mad it wouldn&#146;t matter.
She&#146;d just adjust and do whatever needed to be done to keep her safe, even if it
meant giving up the road and making a home somewhere.</p>

<p>Gabrielle was so preoccupied with the emotions
crossing her partner&#146;s face that she didn&#146;t notice that long ears had managed to
climb up on their table and was staggering towards Xena. She brought her hand to her lips,
curled her fingers into a tight fist and held it firmly against her mouth as she watched
him scurry up the side of Xena&#146;s mug. She gasped when she watched him fall in. It was
shear reflex that plunged her hand into the mug.</p>

<p>Xena, who had been tipping her chair back on its
rear two legs was once again thrown off balance and fell backwards. Gabrielle removed her
hand from the mug and crammed long ears in her scroll bag. &quot;Stay there!&quot; She
growled as she got to her feet and moved to Xena&#146;s side. The other patrons watched
intently as the young woman knelt as the side of the warrior who made no effort to move.</p>

<p>To Gabrielle&#146;s surprise, Xena was just lying
there laughing softly to herself. Tears were forming at the corners of her blackened eyes.
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; The bard asked as she knelt down.</p>

<p>Xena&#146;s merely nodded and continued laughing.
</p>

<p>&quot;Come on let&#146;s get you up.&quot;
Gabrielle grasped her partner&#146;s arm and helped her to her feet. The warrior very
gingerly wiped the tears from her face as she tipped her chair upright.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena exactly what&#146;s so funny?&quot;
Gabrielle asked as she watched Xena take her seat and look into her now empty mug.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any idea what kind of a day
I&#146;m having?&quot; She chuckled. &quot;Why exactly did you do that?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle bit her lip. &quot;Rough one huh?&quot;
She completely ignored the second question.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah. That&#146;s an
understatement.&quot; The warrior noticed the bard&#146;s lack of answer to her last
question, but decided to drop it. She just didn&#146;t have the energy. &quot;I would
really almost prefer to fight for an entire week than have one day like this. It&#146;s
just so ridiculous it&#146;s exhausting.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle took the empty mug to the bar and got
it refilled. She also got a towel and mopped up the mess that she had made while
retrieving the drunken little gremlin. She returned the towel to the bar and watched the
other patrons in the bar as they snickered quietly at the misfortune of the woman warrior
across the room. &#145;It&#146;s a good thing they don&#146;t have a clue who they&#146;re
snickering about&#146; Gabrielle thought as she made her way back to the table.</p>

<p>&quot;You know there&#146;s only one thing that
would make my day a complete loss.&quot; Xena said as she took a sip of her ale.</p>

<p>&quot;What&#146;s that?&quot; Gabrielle said as
she took her seat.</p>

<p>From across the room at the front door, his voice
rang out. &quot;Xena! Gabrielle!&quot;</p>

<p>Xena just hung her head and shook it back and
forth slowly. &quot;That!&quot; She said as she jerked her thumb towards the door.</p>

<p>Gabrielle watched as Joxer crossed the room and
settled himself into a third chair at their table. He picked up Gabrielle&#146;s wine and
drained it. He sat it back down on the table and smiled at her. &quot;Thanks.&quot; He
said as he licked his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re welcome.&quot; She said as she
rose and crossed to the bar, smacking him on the back of the head on her way. </p>

<p>His ill-fitting helmet slipped over his eyes and
twisted catching his nose in the strap. &quot;Owww.&quot; He whined as he readjusted the
helmet and turned to the warrior. &quot;Xena! What in Tartarus happened to your
face!?&quot; He said loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, compared to what&#146;s going to
happen to yours if you don&#146;t be quiet!&quot; She growled.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot; He mumbled as Gabrielle
returned and placed a mug in front of him. She took her seat and sipped her wine.</p>

<p>&quot;So my warrior chums what brings you to
Onlet?&quot; He asked as he tipped his mug to his lips.</p>

<p>&quot;One,&quot; Xena growled. &quot;We are
not&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here for any particular reason.&quot;
Gabrielle cut her off hoping to spare Joxer&#146;s feelings from what she was sure would
be an ego crushing blow by her partner&#146;s words. &quot;We&#146;re just taking a few
days off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like she needs it.&quot; He said as
he jerked his head towards Xena, who just growled at him. &quot;It looks like she ran face
first into a&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Joxer knock it off!&quot; Xena warned him
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena&#146;s had a rough day Joxer. You may
just want to drink your ale and be quiet.&quot; Gabrielle said softly.</p>

<p>Joxer leaned over to Gabrielle and whispered.
&quot;So what did happen?&quot;</p>
