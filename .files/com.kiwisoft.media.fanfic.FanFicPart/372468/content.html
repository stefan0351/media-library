The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 13 by patricia51<p>(Vox Populi, Vox Dei. Theresa and Jerry promise to behave themselves from now on. At least while you all are looking.)<p>While, unknown to them, Alex's parents were misbehaving downstairs Alex and Juliet were getting ready for bed. Alex was brushing her teeth, having finally wrestled the sink away from Juliet, who tended to lavish a great deal of care on her teeth.<p>"Vampires don't get cavities," she had explained. "But now I can and those pictures they passed around in health class, well, they're scary. I don't want to have my teeth fall apart like THAT."<p>Arguments to the contrary didn't sway her and discussions of dentists only made the teen ex-vampire brush and floss more. So everyone put up with it although Alex tended to roll her eyes and bump with her hip when she thought enough was enough. Since Juliet just bumped back those efforts more often than not led to foaming kisses and quick gropes. But tonight Juliet had surrendered without too much argument.<p>When Alex came out of the bathroom Juliet was sitting on the edge of her bed brushing her long hair. Alex sat next to her and took the brush. Both girls wore the soft, brightly colored cotton t-shirts that they usually slept in<p>"May I?" she asked even as she parted the long brown tresses enough to place a kiss on the back of Juliet's neck.<p>"Be my guest," smiled Juliet as she braced her hands on the bed and turned slightly to present her back to her friend. Alex, the tip of her tongue sticking out of her lips in concentration, began brushing.<p>The two girls sat close together, enjoying a companionable silence broken only by the sound of the hairbrush as it slid through Juliet's hair. That silence lasted for several minutes until Alex spoke.<p>"That's interesting."<p>"What?"<p>"It seems someone's fingers have found their way to the inside of my knee."<p>"Wow, that is interesting." replied Juliet, who shifted her weight slightly to one side. "I wonder what they are doing there and where they could have come from."<p>"I'm not sure of the second part, not completely anyway, although I have my suspicions," Alex admitted. She jumped slightly. "However, they seem to be working their way up my leg. I can feel them on the inside of my thigh now."<p>"Just fingers?" asked Juliet as she leaned back against Alex.<p>"No," the dark haired wizardess said with a slight tremor in her voice. "There seems to be a palm attached to those fingers. And that palm is beginning to rub in small circles against my skin."<p>"Is it bothersome?" inquired the brunette.<p>"Well, yes and no. It certainly isn't painful but it does seem to make me squirm a bit, even as it makes me feel very warm." Alex set the hairbrush as though she had forgotten what it was in the wake of this new discovery. "I also feel something right down deep inside the center of my body."<p>"But that feeling deep inside you doesn't hurt does it?" Juliet turned slightly towards the other girl. Her lips found a shapely ear and began to nibble on it and tug lightly on the lobe.<p>"I think it would only hurt if the cause of that deep feeling were to leave me forever." Alex's hand disappeared under the hem of Juliet's t-shirt, causing a gasp from the other teen as that t-shirt slid up to reveal the bottom curve of a small but exquisite breast.<p>"I don't think that is ever going to happen," Juliet whispered. She blew in Alex's ear before shifting her lips to meet those of the Italian-Hispanic girl. She gently pushed Alex back onto the bed, covering her girlfriend with her own body. Her searching palm covered the damp center of Alex's panties and the heel of her hand rubbed where she knew the other girl's pearl was hidden.<p>Alex had pulled Juliet's t-shirt up nearly to her neck so there was no barrier to the dark haired wizardess when she cupped one of the rounded breasts as they fell free. Nor were anything but Juliet's increasingly wet panties in the way as the ex-vampire trapped a smooth thigh between her legs and began to grind herself up and down. A quick twist of her wrist and Juliet entered Alex's wetness with two fingers.<p>"Ohhhhhh," moaned the teen wizardess before her mouth recaptured Juliet's lips. Her forefinger and thumb tightened on the pink nubbin they had been caressing, rolling and tugging it. She braced her foot on the bed and pushed upwards with her thigh, rubbing back against Juliet as the other girl rode her leg. Finally Alex s other hand slid down the smooth back over her until her index finger slipped between the tight globes of the other teen's bottom and began to tease the puckered opening.<p>"Mummmphhh!" came a muffled groan from Juliet. Her fingers spread and her hand worked faster. Her sliding hips kept time, setting up a rhythm that could only build to one conclusion. Kisses were frantic and moans were louder. Juliet plunged her fingers deeply inside her lover and then arched as she thrust herself wildly against Alex just as that slender index finger slipped into her rear end. She barely managed to stifle a scream of pleasure, trapped as she was between her girlfriend's slick thigh and the sweet intruder at home in a place new to her. Her braced arm collapsed and she fell onto Alex, who circled her with her arms and held her tight, even as the other teen shuddered with her own orgasm.<p>The pair snuggled together, squirming around until Alex lay on her back, her head propped up by a pillow. Juliet rested on her side, her own head pillowed on the other girl's shoulder. Alex stroked Juliet's hair and kissed the top of the other teen's head.<p>"Well, that was a bit unexpected but absolutely lovely."<p>A soft giggle responded as Juliet kissed the bare shoulder her head rested on.<p>"I know. But oh Alex after the events today I needed that so much."<p>"Oh yes sweetheart," the darker haired girl agreed. "There was definitely a lot of built up energy in both of us." She laughed merrily. "This might not be how I thought it would come out but it was better than any other idea I had on releasing it."<p>"Yes, indeed." Juliet smothered a yawn. "Gosh what a day."<p>"I know." Alex hesitated. "I'm so glad you made up with your parents."<p>"So am I. I know they love me but sometimes parents have a strange way of showing that. Of course in the case of a couple of thousand plus year old vampires I guess it's not surprising."<p>"I guess."<p>"Speaking of Dads," Juliet twisted to look up at her girlfriend. "Alex, I love yours. He is amazing!"<p>"He was pretty special today wasn't he?" Alex was unable to keep the pride from her voice. Gosh she really was getting to be a softie nowadays. She was having trouble being sarcastic and caustic at the drop of a hat. But then her Dad WAS pretty special.<p>"He just seemed so in control of everything. He wasn't worried at all about my parents or how they would react or anything. And you know, for him to have set today's meeting up he must have gone and talked to at least my Father before today."<p>"I hadn't even considered that," said Alex said thoughtfully. "But it would be like him. After all, considering what he's done in the past, nothing should surprise me."<p>"What do you mean?" When Alex hesitated Juliet grinned and ran her fingers across the other teen's flat stomach and then started them creepping upwards."<p>"Stop that!"<p>"Tell me," commanded Juliet.<p>"When we first started magic lessons I thought to myself 'How can I learn magic from someone who lost their family's competition?' And my dad sometimes comes across as a bit stuffy, especially when it comes to magic."<p>The dark haired girl looked embarrassed. "When we first met my Uncle Kelbo, my Dad's older brother, I thought that here was someone fun-loving and exciting, not all caution and care and restraint and 'don't do this and don't do that' like my Dad."<p>"What happened?"<p>"Let's just say that being a sea chimp isn't everything its cracked up to be, assuming it IS cracked up to be anything at all and my Dad is the one who rescued us. And then I found out the truth."<p>"Which was?"<p>"That my Dad didn't lose the contest. He won it. He was a full wizard."<p>"You say 'was' Alex. What happened?"<p>"My mother happened," Alex replied. "He met my mother and fell in love with her. Since wizards are not allowed to marry mortals he gave up his powers to his brother."<p>"Your Uncle Kelbo."<p>"Yes."<p>"Oh my GOSH! That is the most romantic thing I've ever heard," exclaimed Juliet. "Your dad gave up magic for your mom. Can you imagine anything like that?"<p>Alex wrapped Juliet up in both arms. "Yes I can," she said softly. "I can imagine a beautiful girl who could have lived for a thousand years or more who gave that up to become a mortal."<p>"Well if you ever talk to whomever that beautiful girl is you can tell her from me that there wasn't any choice in the matter. I can understand how your Dad felt, how he still feels. I've seen him look at your Mom."<p>"Besides," the ex-vampire continued with a twinkle in her eyes. "Look what I gave up; sleeping in a coffin, living in a dungeon, drinking blood. Now I can enjoy food, especially mint chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream. I sleep in a comfortable bed. I'm surrounded by a wonderful loving family that accepts me." She pretended to scratch her chin and look thoughtful. "There s something else but I can't QUITE recall what it is..."<p>"You!" Alex released Juliet and pretended to push her with her body. "Get out of my bed!"<p>"This is MY bed thank you very much," replied the other girl, not smothering a giggle very successfully.<p>Alex attempted to pout, at which she failed miserably. Darn, she used to do that so well too. She sighed.<p>"Oh wait, I think I remember that other some thing," Juliet wiggled against her girlfriend. "Oh yes, that was it. I got to fall in love with the cutest, sexiest and most lovely girl in the whole world."<p>"Well when I see her I'll try to fix her up with that beautiful girl you keep claiming you're not. In the meantime I guess we're just stuck with each other."<p>"I think we'll survive." Juliet stretched and kissed Alex.<p>"Juliet? I love you."<p>"I love you too Alex. Alexandra. Alexandra Margarita Russo."<p>"Now go to sleep."<p>"After."<p>"After what?"<p>"After I brush my teeth again."<p>"Oh for heaven's sake."<p>(To Be Continued)
