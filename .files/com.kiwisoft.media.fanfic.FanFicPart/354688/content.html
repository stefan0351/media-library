<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 17 -->

<p>Xander's voice was awed. "Well now we know why Riley was so
attached to the place. Prime location, right next to the university,
on the bus lines, oh and it's own nuclear reactor." Faith and Spike
had managed to find the Watcher and the Wiccan down the hallway that
Riley was trying to run down, and they uncuffed them. Once Faith had
finished yelling at Spike over the bullet holes in the door that led
to where the two had been held they had went in search of Buffy and
Xander. After passing the bodies of several demons that suffered a
combination of cuts and bullet wounds they found the two staring open
mouthed at a nuclear reactor. </p>

<p>Faith slid close to Buffy and took her hand, which caused the
light slayer to grip Faith hand and smile at her. "So, we safe here
Xander?" That caused him to stop gaping and look over his shoulder at
Faith. "Oh yeah, there would be warnings posted if we had entered an
area with a radiation risk." Faith didn't sound convinced. "Are you
sure they didn't break something when digging this place out?" Buffy
was the one to answer that. "This area wasn't filled in." Everyone but
Xander turned to look at her as she continued. "It looks like there
was someone who wanted to keep the Initiative an option." Xander then
contributed. "Yeah, I mean they weren't destroying the equipment, they
were mothballing it." </p>

<p>Giles was the next one to speak. "I guess that would explain
why such valuable equipment was being stored at a National Guard
armory. I don't suppose your military skills involve nuclear
reactors?" Xander shook his head. "Nothing beyond "Stay the hell away
and leave it to the experts."  Tara had been quiet up until that
point. "Then what do we do with it?" Buffy looked over her shoulder at
Tara, but didn't speak. Spike then grumbled. "I suppose I could move
in." They all gaped at the bleach blond vampire as he spoke. "What? I
mean if I'm going to be saddled with the lot of you I might as well do
something helpful, and the idea of taking over the nancy boy's club
house sounds good to me." Giles then spoke. "I suppose the fact it's
far better then some dank crypt, not to mention far more secure
doesn't play into it either?" Spike shrugged. "That and the fact all
this electronic crap should get me some better TV reception."</p>

<p>They all stared at him a moment as Buffy then shrugged. "All
right Spike, you got it. You keep an eye on what's left of the
Initiative." He nodded. "You think you can get the red head down here
to help me hook it all up?" Tara's eyes got wide. "Willow! Is she ok?"
Buffy smiled. "She's worried sick, but otherwise she's fine. She and
Anya are back at the mansion. Now let's get out of here." While Tara
was normally pale hearing that seemed to help some color back into her
cheeks. They all seemed to slump as the tension started to ease and
the group started out of the room Faith then smirked at Spike. "Need
any help moving?" "As long as this place has a TV and a couch I'm set,
and if not I suppose I'll just have to steal some." Buffy then spoke.
"Sppiikkkke." "What? You expect me to get a day job or something?"</p>

<p>As they made their way to the exit Xander had a thoughtful
expression. "You don't still have a thing for Buffy do you?" Spike
looked aghast. "No!" Faith looked between them. "Wait, wait a minute.
Still?" Buffy seemed to be blushing and even Spike looked like he was
about to. "There was nothing between us!" Spike then sounded hurt.
"Well now, you just make it sound cheap." Buffy looked at him wide
eyed. She then saw the vampire was grinning ever so slightly. Shoving
him she sped up her pace to walk in front of the rest of the group.
Tara was the one to explain with a slight stammer in her voice.
"Willow cast a spell and it made Buffy and Spike fall in l…love."
Faith looked at Spike and then over at Buffy, and then back at Spike.
He held his hands up and shook his head. </p>

<p>She then ran forward and grabbed Buffy around the waist and
pulled her to a halt. "Come on B. He was just teasing." She seemed to
sulk at Faith's amused tone, but she did settle back into the embrace.
"Besides, I'd like to think you love me for more then my black
leather." Buffy grinned. "No, the black leather is just a bonus."
Faith laughed and twisted Buffy around and moved in to kiss her, but
before their lips touched they both paused. They let the moment
linger, a kiss simply meant to comfort and to show affection was
becoming something more. It conveyed tenderness, devotion, all with
out hinting at the passion underneath the two of them. It was a
physical kiss that was a caress of the soul. When they broke they
looked back. Giles didn't seem to be looking but he looked back the
only way his smile could be described was that of an approving father
      </p>
<p>Xander and Spike were looking and smirking, and while Xander
seemed to blush when caught Spike's grin just grew. Tara seemed to
have shrunk off to the side, but the expressions both girls gave her
caused her to smile and give a nervous half wave. Buffy then smiled.
"All right, let's go." By this point they were near the entrance and
when Spike stepped out with them they all gave him a look. "Just got
to go grab a few things from the crypt." He then strode off and the
rest shrugged and started walking towards the mansion. All placing
their weapons back into concealment. Giles then addressed Faith.
"Faith, I was hoping to speak to you about using the mansion for your
training sessions. While my flat can be made to accommodate them the
mansion has much more available space."</p>

<p>Faith nodded. "Sounds cool G, we can even set up some bigger
gear in the courtyard if we need it. When I told Angel about me
settling back down here he began some big deal to set me up with the
mansion full time." He smiled. "Excellent." Xander then spoke to
Buffy. "I suppose you two will be shackin up some time soon huh?"
Faith seemed to look a bit scared, but Buffy looked down, and then
looked shyly at Faith. "Sounds good to me."  When Faith started
smiling Buffy then looked over at Tara and reached out to link her arm
around the shy Wiccan's waist. "I suppose I better since I'm sure Tara
has plans for my roomie already." Tara's eyes got wide and she started
shaking her head. Buffy smiled and removed her arm from the Wiccan's
waist and patted her on the shoulder. "It's ok Tara, I think it's
great." Tara smiled, but seemed unwilling to make eye contact with
anyone.</p>

<p>"Well, we, we had talked about it, but…" Buffy smiled. "Willow
didn't know how to tell me." Tara nodded and Buffy continued to smile.
"Well it's no problem now." Tara smiled and her posture seemed to
straighten a bit. Xander then spoke up to Faith from off to the side.
"Now all you have to do is meet the parents." It seemed the slayers
were truly connected because they both had similar expressions of
terror. Xander looked confused. "I can understand Faith being scared,
but why are you worried Buffy?" Before the blonde slayer could answer
she saw a hurt expression cross Faith's face. "It's understandable. I
mean "Mom? Not only have I switched sides, but I chose to go lesbo
with the psycho." Buffy shook her head. "After Angelus I'm not worried
about that. I mean she did forgive you."</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. "That's before she learns I'm getting
naked with her baby." Xander's interest seemed peeked at that, but
with only a look both girls kept him silent. Buffy then stepped close
to her partner and took her hand. "I still say that after Angel she
will probably be happy as long as you are not evil right now. My worry
is the girl in bad girl." Faith arched her brow. "Hey, she accepted
the whole slayer thing. Why would she have a problem with you goin
gay?" Buffy shook her head. "You didn't see her initial response to
throw me out of the house when she learned about it." Faith held
Buffy's hand a little tighter and hugged it to her chest. "Well you
got a place to crash with me. So there's nothing to worry about."	</p>

<p>Buffy rested her head to Faith's shoulder. "I know, but she's
still my mom." Faith's voice was quiet as she put her arm over the
shorter girl's shoulder. "I know." That moment kept the group silent
until they made their way to the edge of the mansions property, Buffy
then spoke up. "Ok, we need to get back in with out the cops noticing
us. Xander was able to make it out so he can make it in on his own
while Faith and I keep an eye on you two." Giles was offended as she
straightened his jacket. "I'll have you know I can be quite stealthy."
Buffy took her Watcher's arm and pulled him behind her. "Then it will
be that much easier for me to keep an eye on you." The rest smirked as
Faith took Tara's arm and Xander followed behind.</p>

<p>They had made it back to a darkened house, and while that
usually seemed to mean trouble everyone seemed to relax when the
slayers did. Tara then spoke. "Where's Willow?" Xander was the one to
answer her. "She's in the same room you two guys slept in last night."
With out another word she hurried off at which Faith smirked slightly.
"They both have it bad don't they?" Giles then spoke. "I believe they
have the right idea. Since everything seems to be in order I will go
get some sleep as well." Faith laughed. "G, I don't think sleeping is
what's on the menu." Giles blushed at that. "Yes, very well. I believe
I shall retire." Xander smirked. "Retire? Already? We haven't even got
your gold watch ready." Giles scowled and moved off while the rest
grinned. Xander smiled. "Still, teasing aside I think I am going to go
break down and clean these weapons and then go climb into bed with
Anya."</p>

<p>Faith smirked. "Going to be any sleeping going on there?"
Xander grinned back. "Wouldn't you like to know?" Faith seemed to
shrug. "I wouldn't mind." Buffy's eyes got wide as Xander laughed and
left. "Faith!" The girl in question smirked at Buffy. "What? Did you
got juiced seeing Action Xander?" Buffy shook her head and took
Faith's hand to guide her towards the bedroom, Faith grinning all the
while. "So is that a yes or a no?" By this time Tara had made it back
to the room she and Willow had spent the night in. She found her hand
was trembling as she reached out and turned the door knob which then
opened with a click that seemed extraordinarily loud to her, but when
the door opened she could see the bed occupant had not stirred.</p>

<p>The click upon closing the door behind her seemed even louder,
but again the bed's occupant seemed to sleep soundly. It was only when
she got close to the bed she saw Willow had not been sleeping well at
all. There was a slight redness to her eyes that seemed to say Willow
had been crying and the expression on her face said that not even
sleep had stopped her worry. Tara's hand dipped down and caressed the
warm skin of Willow's cheek and the reddened eyes opened immediately.
They blinked several seconds, but then locked on Tara as Willow sat
upright. "Tara?" Before Tara could answer Willow wrapped her arms
around her and was hugging her tightly enough to almost bruise. She
hadn't noticed the blonde's squeak as the hug was first applied, but
she did notice that Tara seemed to be squirming in her arms.</p>

<p>Pulling back she still kept contact with Tara by resting her
hands on Tara's upper arms. "Are you ok? Did Riley hurt you?" The last
part was said with more then a little anger and while Tara was nodding
Willow seemed to notice the flash of concern. "I once told Riley if he
hurt Buffy I would beat him with a shovel, and now I have two
reasons." Tara shook her head. "Y…you don't have to worry about Riley
anymore." Willow seemed to pause. "Staked?" Tara nodded again.
"Staked." "Poor Buffy." Tara shook her head. "Faith did it, and Spike
helped her." Initially Willow's hands had moved over Tara's body to
look for injuries, but when they didn't find any they continued, but
far more slowly, almost absently as they talked. While Willow didn't
seem to be thinking about it, more and more Tara wasn't able to think
about anything else, but the feel of Willow's hands on her.</p>

<p>Willow seemed to notice this and smiled, then while the smile
left she slipped close and spoke in a whisper. "I was so worried."
Tara looked away. "It's ok. I like being a Scooby." Willow smiled and
kissed the cheek closest to her. "You do?" Tara nodded, but still
looked away as Willow spoke. "That's good, because I know they like
you. "Tara looked back and started to agree with her, but Willow took
the opportunity to press their lips together. She kept the kiss going
and when Tara took a breath she slipped her tongue into Tara's mouth.
At first Tara seemed surprised, but some instinctive side of her that
wanted Willow responded to the passion in the kiss as much as her
conscious side reveled in the touch of the woman she loved. Before she
knew it her tongue was pressing back against Willow's as they both
laid down on the bed.</p>
