<p><b>Chapter 12</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Fancy meeting you here."</p>
<p>Lilly looked up from her burger, just as Oliver sat down on the bench across from her. She didn't know how exactly to feel about him being there, despite the fact that he was her friend. The last time they'd spoken had been at her birthday party, over a week ago.</p>
<p>"You came here all by yourself?" asked Oliver, stealing a fry off her plate.</p>
<p>Lilly sat up straighter, wary of the conversation she knew could hardly be avoided. "No, I did not."</p>
<p>Oliver looked confused for a second then glanced at the half-eaten burger and fries next to her, before turning his gaze back to Lilly. "You're here with <b>her</b>."</p>
<p>"If by <b>her</b>, you mean Miley, then yes. And I'd appreciate it if you could try to be less rude towards the girl I'm dating."</p>
<p>The confirmation of Miley's presence seemed to make him nervous and his eyes darted around the multiple tables set up outside the burger joint. Lilly did not feel like reassuring him that Miley had gone to the bathroom and was so easily distracted it would likely be another hour before her return. Oliver shook his head and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>"Lilly, why <b>her</b>? There are plenty of people who would love to be your friend."</p>
<p>"Strangely enough, all those people are only concerned with telling me what to do," said Lilly snidely, sick of having this conversation where she didn't know what was going on and he pretended to be looking out for her.</p>
<p>"That's not fair." Oliver almost sounded hurt and Lilly closed her eyes briefly, exhaling heavily.</p>
<p>"No, it's not. But it's also not fair the way Miley is being treated. She has done nothing wrong, nothing that anyone will tell me about, anyway. You know, she lost her dad and brother and everyone treats her like shit…everyone deserves a friend."</p>
<p>Oliver scoffed, stealing another fry, though his eyes kept a surreptitious vigilance. "Yeah, and did <b>you</b> know she was in that car with her dad and brother? Middle of a sunny day…and <b>BAM</b>…lightning strike. The car skidded off the road right into a tree. Her father and brother both died <b>instantly</b> and Miley? Not a damn scratch on her. Now tell me you don't find that odd."</p>
<p>Lilly tried not to let it show on her face that she hadn't known about Miley being in the car, or that lightning, once again, seemed to play a major role. But maybe Miley had a good reason for not telling her that story. Lilly imagined it would be torturous to tell the story of how she watched her father and brother die before her very eyes. "I still don't see why that means I need to stay away from her."</p>
<p>"Look, everything…things just don't make sense. I can't really explain it."</p>
<p>"I <b>know</b> this doesn't make sense, because everyone seems terrified of her, when I <b>know</b> Miley hasn't hurt anyone!" Lilly was getting frustrated with him, again.</p>
<p>Oliver shook his head. "You need to look at the patterns, Lilly. Can't you see that something isn't right here? Normal people don't get struck by lightning <b>four</b> times."</p>
<p>"What?" Lilly looked at him, shocked, only too late realizing she was giving him more ammunition.</p>
<p>His eyes shone almost triumphantly, as if he'd finally gotten under her skin. "Yeah, odd, isn't it? Do you see now that Miley's…"</p>
<p>He stopped so abruptly Lilly briefly wondered whether he'd choked on a fry, but the look of pure terror in his eyes gave him away. Lilly glanced to her right, where Miley was sitting back on the bench, three more baskets of food spread out before her. She seemed relaxed, but Lilly could read some apprehension in her and was surprised Miley had come back over at all with Oliver so close.</p>
<p>Miley, however, looked up as if nothing odd was going on. "Hi, Oliver."</p>
<p>The boy made a strangled sound, glancing at Lilly as if he considered briefly saving her from Miley. Instead, he stood hastily, completely ignoring Miley. "Think about what I said, Lilly."</p>
<p>He was off in a hurry, returning to the table of his friends, who all seemed to leave rather quickly after he motioned in Miley's direction. Lilly wished talking to him didn't always leave her feeling so uneasy and worried. She looked at her girlfriend, who was happily munching away on her food, as if nothing was wrong. Lilly sighed.</p>
<p>"You know Oliver?"</p>
<p>Miley didn't even look up from her food. "Yeah, we used to be friends…a long time ago."</p>
<p>She smirked at the end and Lilly rolled her eyes, wondering why it was so hard to get Miley to be serious instead of quoting song lyrics. Lilly again wondered if there was something to what Oliver had been telling her, but pushed that thought aside. Miley was the sweetest, most innocent person she knew; there was no way she was doing anything untoward. Lilly stole a hush puppy out of her basket and Miley made a face at her.</p>
<p>"How many times did you get struck by lightning?" asked Lilly, trying to sound casual, but her gut was twisting.</p>
<p>"Four." Miley did not seem perturbed at all, as if this revelation was nothing unusual. She popped a tater tot into her mouth and turned to Lilly, grinning. "Momma says that's why I can't sit still. Too much energy."</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't help but smile; as always, Miley's enthusiasm was contagious, but she did feel a little uneasy. "Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "You didn't ask. Why's it matter?"</p>
<p>Lilly thought it did, at the very least just because if she'd known, Oliver wouldn't have been able to get one over on her. But as much as she wanted to be angry or upset, she knew without a doubt Miley wasn't trying to trick her or lie to her or hide things from her. Miley was just Miley. Lilly took her girlfriend's hand and intertwined their fingers.</p>
<p>"It only matters because I love you and I can't believe I came so close, four times, to never even getting to meet you. Will you tell me what happened? You don't have to, if it's a bad subject…"</p>
<p>Lilly wanted to smack herself; how could getting struck by lightning not be a bad subject? Miley, however, merely shrugged. "I don't remember the first time…I was with my dad and brother, in the yard. I think I was four. Well, the second time, I was at school, when I was ten. It was during recess, so pretty much everyone saw. That's when momma and daddy decided to home school me."</p>
<p>She sounded like it was no big deal, but Lilly couldn't believe what she was hearing. She squeezed her girlfriend's hand tighter and Miley gave her a soft smile that made her melt. Lilly knew she was helpless around this girl. "It didn't happen for a while after that. Everyone made sure I didn't go outside if it even got cloudy, but a few days after my daddy and Jackson died…I was just so mad and…it was pouring and I went outside. That's the one that gave me that nifty scar. The last time I was climbing a tree that got struck and it jumped to me. Made me fall out of the tree, too."</p>
<p>She did sound upset about that last part and Lilly would have laughed, if she didn't feel so heavy. Miley could have been taken from her, multiple times, and the thought ripped a gaping hole into her chest. She shook her head slowly, trying to keep herself under control. "How did you survive?"</p>
<p>"Just lucky, I guess. I did get burned a few times, but it beats being dead." Miley grinned at that, popping another tater tot into her mouth.</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't exactly disagree, but she still felt very unsettled. Oliver's words still rang in her head and though she never paid them much mind before, she did agree that it was odd. But everything was odd; Miley, sure, but Oliver and the other kids her age, Miley's family, the whole town, really, were one giant confusing mess. Miley nudged her in the side, smiling and Lilly realized she'd been staring at her half-eaten burger for several minutes. She realized there was no point of dwelling on these things that didn't make sense, because one thing made perfect sense to her – being with Miley.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>Lilly tapped her fingers on the steering wheel in rhythm to the music. She liked driving, though here it was hardly useful. Most of the time, she was better served just using her skateboard and feet, taking the shortcuts that got her where she was going much faster. Today, however, she'd been sent to the store with a long shopping list and a strict time limit. She was on her way back home, to return the car to her mother who had an appointment in the city. Lilly glanced at the clock. She could probably start heading to Miley's as soon as she got home and get there just in time for her girlfriend's daily prison sentence to be over.</p>
<p>She turned onto a back road and slowed when she noticed a group of kids gathered on the side of the road. There were six or seven of them, mostly boys around her age. As she got closer, she could hear them yelling, their faces taunting and angry. One of the boys threw something and she looked ahead. She slammed on her breaks immediately, drawing their attention. Lilly jumped out of the SUV, though left it running, and stepped directly in front of their target. They were maybe only fifteen feet apart, and all seemed out of breath.</p>
<p>"Lilly, what the fuck are you doing? Get out of here!"</p>
<p>She looked more closely at the boy and realized with a shock it was her brother. His fists were balled and he looked just as angry as everyone else. "Michael? What the hell are you doing?"</p>
<p>"She's just getting what she deserves. She ain't supposed to be in town!" yelled a second boy and the rest of the group chimed in. Lilly took a step back, until she felt their target behind her. She reached back and grasped Miley's hand.</p>
<p>"You're all fucking crazy. She's done nothing to you, just leave her alone," said Lilly, anger coursing through her. She wondered if they'd attack again, even with her present, but hoped her brother would at least step in to prevent her from getting hurt. Miley's hand trembled in hers and the normally vivacious brunette had yet to make a sound. She tugged on the girl's hand to pull her away, though kept facing the group, back to Miley. "Come on, Miley, we're leaving."</p>
<p>She slowly moved Miley towards her car, keeping herself between her girlfriend and the crazy people. Lilly did not take her eyes off of them once, not when she put Miley in the passenger side, nor when she got back into the driver's seat and pulled away. She even watched them in the rearview mirror for several feet, but they had not moved from their position. When they were out of sight, Lilly let out a shaky breath and finally glanced at the girl beside her. She gasped in shock.</p>
<p>"Shit, Miles, you're bleeding." Miley's face was calm, but pale, as she pressed a hand to her forehead. Blood was leaking out between her fingers, running down her arm and dripping onto her pants. Lilly felt a rising panic, but forced it down. Her hands shook as she held the steering wheel. She reached for the backseat and grabbed her sweatshirt, pushing it into Miley's empty hand. "Here, Miles, use it to stop the bleeding."</p>
<p>Miley looked at the sweatshirt, but made no move to follow directions. "But it's your favorite."</p>
<p>At least Miley still seemed her regular self, she figured. She wondered what she was supposed to do. There was no hospital in town and she had to get the SUV back to her mother under threat of death. She turned onto the road towards Miley's home. "Miley, <b>you're</b> my favorite. Now use it before you bleed to death in my car."</p>
<p>Miley smiled at her words, so normally it made Lilly wonder if she even knew what was going on. If not even having stones thrown at her could perturb this girl, maybe something really was wrong with her. But Miley followed her instructions at last, pressing the sweatshirt to her forehead, though Lilly could still see the blood that had run down her arm. She suddenly realized how much blood there was and bile rose in her throat. She forced it down, making a sharp turn onto the unpaved road towards Grandma Ruby's property. Normally, she'd take the SUV across the bumpy road as gently as possible, but today she did not care. She stopped almost directly in front of the door, the tires kicking up dust.</p>
<p>Lilly ran around to the other side and helped Miley out of the car. Blood now covered a good amount of the front of her shirt and thighs. Lilly wrapped an arm around her waist to escort her inside, though Miley seemed surprisingly steady on her feet. Lilly practically shoved the door open, yelling as soon as they entered.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Stewart! Come quick!" Lilly gently pushed Miley to sit on one of the barstools, just as Susan came running into the room.</p>
<p>She immediately rushed to her daughter's side, moving the bloody sweatshirt aside to assess the damage. "What happened?"</p>
<p>"Lilly was like a knight in shining armor…she rode in…on her SUV…and saved me," said Miley, smiling, though she was starting to sound slightly off. Susan turned to Lilly for a proper explanation.</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged, trying to shake the adrenaline still coursing through her veins. "I was just driving by. Some kids…they were throwing stones at her…"</p>
<p>Lilly could tell the woman was clenching her jaw and she even thought Susan's eyes filled with tears. Susan pressed the sweatshirt back against Miley's head and grabbed the First Aid Kit they kept in one of the cabinets. Lilly knew, with a kid like Miley, closest to the door was probably the best spot for a First Aid Kit. She watched as Susan removed the sweater again and laid out some supplies on the counter. Lilly looked at Miley, who was now strangely silent, but noted, to her relief, the trickle of blood had slowed immensely. There was, nevertheless, a gash stretching just across her hairline.</p>
<p>Then Lilly remembered her mother's appointment. She did not want to leave Miley, not after what had just happened, but she knew if she didn't, she probably wouldn't get to see Miley for a long time. "I uh…I gotta get the SUV back to my mom…I will be back as quickly as possible. Are you going to… take her to a hospital?"</p>
<p>Susan was cleaning the gash, not looking at her. Lilly noticed Miley flinch, though her face remained unusually stoic. "No, I think the bleeding's mostly stopped."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and squeezed her girlfriend's hand, before running out the door to the SUV. She made it home in record time, sure that by tomorrow the whole town would know about her excessive speeding. She rushed inside, yelling for her mother. "Mom, come on, you have to drop me back off at Miley's!"</p>
<p>There was no answer and she went into the kitchen to find her mother. She found her brother instead, casually sipping from a bottle of water. Lilly balled her fists, angry enough to consider punching him, though she knew it would only keep her from Miley. She walked up to him, fury written on her face. "What the hell is your problem?"</p>
<p>He stood straighter, narrowing his eyes. "<b>Mine?</b> What the hell is <b>your</b> problem?"</p>
<p>"My problem is you and your dumbass friends throwing rocks at my girlfriend and splitting her head open!"</p>
<p>"Well, my problem is your girlfriend!"</p>
<p>His voice was just as angry as hers and Lilly almost took a step back. "You don't even know her! What the hell, Michael?"</p>
<p>"I know enough, Lilly. She's bad news and you need to stay away from her."</p>
<p>"Not you, too," groaned Lilly. She crossed her arms. "What, did they brainwash you? Make you drink their Kool-Aid? Miley's done nothing wrong; she's just a kid like you and me."</p>
<p>Michael scoffed. "She's not like you and me. She's evil."</p>
<p>Lilly actually laughed out loud, so ridiculous was his statement. "You can't be serious."</p>
<p>"Wake up, Lilly, everyone sees it but you!"</p>
<p>"Her family obviously doesn't."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "They might be better served if they did. How many bad things have happened to that family? To people in this town?"</p>
<p>It took Lilly several seconds to put it together, but when she did, things finally started making sense. "And you think they're all Miley's fault? Michael, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."</p>
<p>"From the moment she was born, her whole family suffered nothing but bad luck. Her mother almost died in childbirth and then everyone else starting dying or getting hurt."</p>
<p>"I don't see how that's Miley's fault."</p>
<p>He groaned, as if unbelieving of her stupidity. "Everyone who talks to her or looks at her…bad things happen to them. You've seen it for yourself, Lilly! Old Ed, Jake Ryan, even some damn chicken that was stupid enough to cross her."</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head; her brain felt scrambled, thousands of words and images flitting through at rapid pace. "You're insane, Michael. How is Miley supposed to have done these things?"</p>
<p>"I don't know…she's possessed or a witch or just plain evil or something! There were these…plagues and then she was born under a bad omen; the old women who delivered her told the whole town she was evil and a few days later she was dead!"</p>
<p>Lilly brought a hand to her forehead, feeling utterly exhausted all of a sudden. Months of tip-toeing around these secrets and fears and this sudden moment of truth had her wishing she could go back to before. She looked at her brother, though her anger had mostly turned into defeat. Lilly knew there was no way to fight deep-seated superstition and craziness. "This is insane, Michael. I can't believe <b>you</b> of all people would fall for this bullshit. Plagues and omens? You can't be serious. I've known Miley for over two months and nothing bad has happened to me…how do you explain that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing has happened, <b>yet</b>. And I'm not letting you risk this family's safety for a piece of ass."</p>
<p>Lilly saw red. She was about to charge her brother, consequences be damned, when their mother entered the kitchen. Heather immediately noticed her children's angry faces and Lilly's aggressive stance. "What's going on here?"</p>
<p>"Lilly is putting this family at risk."</p>
<p>"Michael and his friends split my girlfriend's head open!"</p>
<p>They both spoke at once and it took the woman several seconds to decipher what they'd said, but when she did, she gaped at her son. "Michael, is that true?"</p>
<p>"Mom…" said Michael, in that tone of voice that meant he didn't want to talk about it.</p>
<p>"Mom, can you drive me back to Miley's? I wanna make sure she's okay," said Lilly softly, ignoring her brother's intense stare.</p>
<p>Heather nodded weakly, still too shocked by her son's actions. She ushered Lilly towards the doorway, but turned to face Michael, voice stern. "Don't you dare leave this house until I get back, young man. We'll talk about this later."</p>
