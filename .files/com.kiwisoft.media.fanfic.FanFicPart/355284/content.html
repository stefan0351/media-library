<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - Feverdreams, Nightmares, And Arguments -->

<p>"Sam, come on, you have to eat something," Brooke coaxed the sick girl. Sam
groaned and turned away. Eating was definitely something she never wanted to do
again. It wasn't a cold, it was the unholy flu. </p>
<p>"Go 'way, Brooke, 'for you get sick, too," Sam protested. Brooke smiled at
the concern but was unswayed. She was worried when Sam wasn't at lunch earlier
and even more worried when Lily said she's gone home sick. Sam wasn't known for
going home sick or missing much school at all, in fact. If you're not there, you
might miss a juicy tidbit of journalistic information. So Brooke had gone home
after lunch to check on her, found her father absolutely livid and then worried
he'd actually done Sam in when she discovered that the two of them had had an
altercation. He'd bellowed something about 'getting Sam the Hell out of his
house if he had to get a court order to do it' and stomped off again and Brooke
went to find Sam. </p>
<p>Sam was dead asleep on top of her covers fully clothed and bathed in sweat.
She'd caught the awful flu that was presently decimating most of Kennedy High.
Thankfully, Brooke had been smart enough to get a flu shot, but not Sam, not
I-never-get-the-flu Sam. (This'll teach her) Brooke thought sadly as she put a
cold compress on Sam's flushed forehead and tried again to get her to eat some
chicken soup. </p>
<p>"Eat some soup, Sammy," Brooke whispered. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Why? So I can throw it back up again? No thanks," she retorted with a sigh.
She hated being sick, but she loved having Brooke take care of her. (Guilty
pleasure, bad Sammy) Sam scolded herself weakly. She loved being in Brooke's
arms and being sick gave her a reason that wouldn't make Mike freak too bad. </p>
<p>"Come on, Sammy, for me?" Brooke begged. Sam's eyes opened fractionally and
she frowned. </p>
<p>"Cheater," she accused. Brooke smiled. She knew that would work even if it
was a dirty trick. Sam managed to choke down a few mouthfuls of lukewarm soup
before shaking her head for Brooke to stop. </p>
<p>"OK, enough for now, I get the point," Brooke assured her. Sam settled back
into Brooke's embrace while Brooke stroked her damp hair away from her face. "I
heard you and Dad had a meeting of the minds earlier." She watched Sam's nose
wrinkle in distaste. </p>
<p>"It was one sided. I was armed, he wasn't," Sam whispered tiredly. She
snuggled deeper into Brooke's arms needing to feel better anyway she could.
Brooke always made her feel better, emotionally and physically. Brooke giggled
slightly at Sam's comment. </p>
<p>"There was a time I would have been insulted by that comment but I'm sure he
wasn't. He didn't hurt you, did he?" she asked, honestly afraid that without her
or Jane was referee, Mike had hit Sam. She felt Sam shake her head. </p>
<p>"No," Sam yawned. "I hit him. Sorry." Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"He probably deserved it. What did he say?" </p>
<p>"'M tired, Brooke. Don' wanna talk about it right now. Can I get some sleep
instead?" Sam asked, sounding just as tired as she said she was. Brooke mentally
kicked herself for interrogating the ill girl and hugged the quaking form in her
arms. </p>
<p>"Of course, Sammy. Sleep, I'll keep you safe," she whispered. She felt rather
than saw Sam smile. </p>
<p>"You always do, Princess." </p>

<p>**</p>

<p>They were both woken later by a pair of angry voices carrying down the hall.
Brooke looked down at Sam who looked back with red rimmed, sick but awake eyes.
</p>
<p>"Mom and Mike," she pointed out sadly. Brooke nodded. They sat silently and
listened. </p>
<p>"She can't stay here, Jane. This is my house and she isn't welcome here!" </p>
<p>"How can you say that? She's my daughter! If she isn't welcome here than
neither am I! Neither is Mac!" </p>
<p>"You're my fiancee, I love you and Mac is my daughter, same as Brooke is. Sam
means nothing to me!" Brooke held Sam closer to her as an ever so small sob
slipped past Sam's lips and she buried her face in Brooke's chest. </p>
<p>"Jane, don't you see what she's doing? She doesn't care for Brooke like she
says she does. She's just using her to break us up. She's been trying to break
us up since day one. She can't stand the thought of you being with anyone other
than Joe. This is the only way she has left to stop you from moving on with your
own life." </p>
<p>"That's a lie and you know it! Sam wants nothing more than for me to be happy
and she knows that being with you makes me happy. Or at least it used to until
you started acting this way!" </p>
<p>"Is the fact that Sam is gay and involved with Brooke making you happy?"
There was a pause before Jane answered. </p>
<p>"At first, no. But then I talked to her, and Brooke, Mike. And I saw the love
between them. They're happy together, Mike and that makes me happy. Damnit,
that's enough." </p>
<p>"How the Hell do we explain this to MacKenzie when she's old enough to
understand?" </p>
<p>"Good question," Sam whispered. Brooke 'shushed' her. </p>
<p>"We cross that bridge when we get to it. Besides, she'll grow up with it as
an everyday thing, it won't strike her as abnormal. Mike, you have to stop
blaming Sam for this, it isn't anyone's fault." </p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong. It IS Sam's fault. I'm losing you, I'm losing
Brooke and it's all Sam's fault. This isn't normal, Jane and I won't accept it
as such. Somehow Sam has played on Brooke's confusion and vulnerability and
after she gets what she wants, she'll leave Brooke, broken and destroyed on the
side of the road and move on to someone new. I won't stand by and watch her
destroy my daughter." </p>
<p>"God, I never knew you thought so little of Sam." </p>
<p>"I always liked Sam but I questioned her ethics. You remember how far she was
willing to go to get a story, what she'd do to hurt Brooke? How can you stand
there and tell me that this is the same girl professing her undying love for
Brooke when a year ago she was tearing her apart in the school paper every
chance she got?" </p>
<p>"That was different, Mike. There's a thin line between love and hate." </p>
<p>"That's a weak excuse, Jane." </p>
<p>"It's the truth." </p>
<p>"Your truth. My truth is that this is not a topic open for discussion. Either
they knock it off or Sam leaves, am I making myself clear?" </p>
<p>"..." </p>
<p>"I'm serious, Jane." </p>
<p>"How is telling them to 'knock it off' any better than the pranks they used
to play to break us up?" </p>
<p>"We're finished with this conversation." </p>
<p>Sam and Brooke heard Mike walk down the hall and a door slam somewhere else
in the house. A few seconds later, there was a soft knock on their door. </p>
<p>"Come in," Brooke called softly. Jane walked in, tears still evident on her
face. She gave the two a weak smile. </p>
<p>"How you feeling sweety?" she asked Sam as she sat on the bed and felt Sam's
forehead. She was worried at how hot Sam felt. Sam spared her a weak smile. </p>
<p>"Like I'm heading to the gallows in the morning," Sam responded. Jane sighed.
</p>
<p>"I take it you two overheard?" Both girls nodded. "We'll find a way through
this, I promise." </p>
<p>"We know," Brooke answered. Sam yawned and closed her eyes, snuggling close
to Brooke and letting the flu take her away from the cold reality she didn't
feel like dealing with at the moment. Brooke and Jane exchanged concerned and
wary glances over her sick form. </p>
<p>"I promise," Jane repeated. </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Another pair of angry voices, these two closer and even more rage filled
awakened Sam the next morning. </p>
<p>"You will get dressed for school, young lady, and THAT is final!" Sam scooted
up further in the bed to listen better. </p>
<p>"Someone has to stay home with her Dad," Brooke's voice carried to Sam's ears
sounding at once furious and at the same time concerned. Sam sighed. Now it was
Brooke and Mike's turn to rip into each other over her. </p>
<p>"She's a big girl, Brooke, she can take care of herself!" Mike bellowed. </p>
<p>"She's got a temperature of 103!" Brooke screamed. "She spent most of last
night delerious and vomiting," Sam winced at the fuzzy memory of Brooke holding
back her hair and rubbing her back. Truth to tell, she still felt like crap. "At
one point she thought she was Mighty Mouse!" (Oh, great, now I'm never going to
live that one down) </p>
<p>"Jane can stay with her, you have to go to school." </p>
<p>"Mom would but she has an important business meeting and you know it!" Brooke
responded. "I have to stay with Sam, unless you want to," she asked
sarcastically. </p>
<p>"Don't use that tone with me young lady," Mike warned. Sam yawned and rolled
her eyes. (Mike really needs new material) </p>
<p>"Well? Are you? Because if not, I am. Sam is in no shape to take care of
herself. And THAT is final, Dad," Brooke said in a tone that Sam knew meant that
no matter what Mike said or did she wouldn't be changing her mind. </p>
<p>"Who are you because you sure aren't my daughter?" Mike asked angrily. Sam
blinked back the tears that sprang to her eyes and she knew that Brooke was
probably doing the same thing outside the door. </p>
<p>"I AM still your daughter, you just have no interest in who that really is
anymore because I don't fit the mold you want me to. And I'm not going to
apologize for that either. Live with it or get out of my way," the door swung
open and a highly upset Brooke stormed into the room, slamming it behind her.
Sam jumped. Brooke saw that she was awake and the anger drained away from her
expression. </p>
<p>"How you feeling, sweetie?" she asked as she put her hand on Sam's forehead.
Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Like shit," Sam whispered, her voice gone and weariness beginning to
overtake her. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"You're still awfully warm. Come on, back to sleep with you," she said as she
tucked Sam back in and crawled in beside her. Sam instictively curled up beside
Brooke and Brooke wrapped her arms around the sick girl. "Sleep, Sammy, you'll
feel better later." </p>
<p>"Promise?" Sam asked just above a whisper, eyes shut and all ready half
asleep. Brooke smiled and placed a kiss in Sam's sweat dampened hair. </p>
<p>"I promise." </p>
