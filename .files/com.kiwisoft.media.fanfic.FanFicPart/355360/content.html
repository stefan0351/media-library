<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Happy Birthday Mac -->

<p>"Hap-py birth-day dear Maaaaac, happy birthday to youuuuuuu!"
the assembled crowd sang as Mac clapped happily and dug both hands into the
small Elmo shaped cake set in front of her. She then attempted to shove both
cake filled and frosting covered hands into her mouth. </p>
<p>"That's our Mac, true to form," Sam quipped as she laughed and
reached over to wipe some errant frosting from Mac's forehead. She wondered how
Mac could have gotten it that high up so quickly but had no doubt she'd be
covered in it before too long. Mac reached out and wiped her hand on the front
of Sam's shirt. Sam glared at her little sister. </p>
<p>"Gee, thanks Mac," she said dryly. Brooke walked up behind her
laughing. </p>
<p>"Look, Sammy, she's sharing with you," she laughed. Sam moved
her glare from Mac to Brooke. </p>
<p>"Ooo, you're funny, Princess," she sighed. "But looks aren't
everything." Brooke looked at her with a mock-horrified look. </p>
<p>"Ouch, Sammy, but then you'd know, I guess," she shot back. </p>
<p>"Har har," Sam stuck out her tongue. "Can you believe she's a
year old?" Brooke shook her head as she wrapped her arms around Sam, careful to
avoid the frosting stain. </p>
<p>"Seems like yesterday we were delivering her right here in
this kitchen," Brooke responded as they watched their parents and friends play
with Mac in her highchair while Mike filmed the whole thing with his ever
present videocamera. Mac was flinging cake everywhere but no one seemed to care. </p>
<p>"She's going to be one hell of a sugared up one year old," Sam
pointed out. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup, and just think, Mom and Dad get to deal with her." Sam
laughed. </p>
<p>"Good point," she agreed. "I gotta go change my shirt."
</p>
<p>"I'll come with," Brooke suggested. They both went upstairs
and Brooke sat on the bed and watched as Sam changed out of her stained shirt
and into a fresh one with a lopsided grin. Sam recognized the look on Brooke's
face and wagged a finger at her. </p>
<p>"Get your mind out of the gutter and my pants, Princess. We
have guests downstairs waiting for us who are going to notice our absence before
too long. Not to mention it's our little sister's first birthday party. We don't
want to miss that," she reminded her lover. Brooke pouted knowing Sam was right. </p>
<p>"Awwww," she growled. Sam raised an eyebrow at her.
</p>
<p>"Not that I mind, cuz I don't, believe me I don't. But what
has gotten into you lately? You've got the libido of a crazed ferret on crack,"
Sam said with a wide smile as Brooke blushed a deep red color. </p>
<p>"Am I that bad?" she asked quietly. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"I said I don't mind. I like it, actually." </p>
<p>"I love you Sam," Brooke said as she looked at Sam seriously.
Sam knelt down in front of her. </p>
<p>"I know you do. I love you too. Is that why?" she asked as she
stroked Brooke's cheek gently. Brooke shook her head and shrugged. </p>
<p>"It's just so much bad has happened to you, to us. Sometimes
I'm afraid of losing you to that, Sammy," she admitted as a few tears fell. Sam
brushed them away with her thumbs. "And I just want to hold on to you as tightly
as I can. I love you, I want you, I need you." Sam smiled gently. </p>
<p>"Same here, Princess. But I'm not going anywhere, I promise.
My heart and soul are yours for as long as you want them. A day, a week, a
month, a year, forever. Whatever you choose. You'll never lose me until the day
you say good-bye." </p>
<p>"That day will never come. Forever, Sammy," Brooke said
firmly. Sam smiled again, this time a wide and bright smile as she stood up
taking Brooke with her. </p>
<p>"Forever it is, then, Brooke. Come on, we have a party to get
back to." </p>
<p>"OK," Brooke agreed. Sam stopped suddenly and turned back to
Brooke. </p>
<p>"By the way, this by no means means that we should cut down on
the sex, you know that right?" she asked. Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"Wouldn't dream of it," she responded while pulling Sam into a
heated kiss. </p>

<p>When they returned to the party, as Sam had figured, Mac was
covered in cake and frosting and was still laughing wildly. Sam was glad to see
several others, most notably Carmen and Lily, were also hit by the frosting
monster. She and Brooke entered the kitchen and started laughing. Everyone just
stared at the two of them. </p>
<p>"What's so funny?" Lily asked as she tried to wipe some
frosting off her cheek. </p>
<p>"I see I wasn't Mac's only victim," Sam quipped as she kept
her distance from Mac and watched her mother try to clean the baby up some. The
cake was no more, either eaten or being worn by the various occupants of the
room. </p>
<p>"Yeh, well, she's an energetic one," Harrison said. He had a
small baby sized handprint on the front of his black tee shirt made entirely of
frosting. </p>
<p>"Wait twenty minutes for the sugar to actually hit her
system," Brooke warned. It seemed like the only one in the room to have escaped
Mac's cake filled wrath was Nicole, but that was only because she kept a
discreet distance. Even Mary Cherry was picking cake from her hair. </p>
<p>"OK, I think it's present time," Jane said after she'd cleaned
Mac up. Everyone moved to the livingroom where they unwrapped Mac's gifts,
seeing as she was a little too small to do it herself. Jane had changed the
baby's clothes so everyone took turns holding the sugared up child (except
Nicole). </p>
<p>Mac got a pair of baby sized Prada heels from Nicole, a small
leather jacket from MC (which Lily refrained from commenting on), several
stuffed animals from Carmen, and a myriad of other gifts that any one year old
would be happy to have if they were aware of having them. </p>
<p>Eventually, though, Mac started to fuss. Knowing the way
things worked by now and wanting to see everyone's faces, Brooke handed the baby
to Sam before she could protest. Mac calmed down, grabbed a handful of Sam's
long hair, and snuggled into her sister's arms with a yawn. </p>
<p>"Oh for crying out loud," Sam sighed as she shot Brooke a
dirty look. "Would you stop doing that?" Brooke giggled at her as their friends
stared at the display in shock. </p>
<p>"It's just so damn cute Sammy," Brooke said between giggles. </p>
<p>"She's right, Sam, and I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't
seen it with my own eyes," Carmen commented. Sam sighed again as Mac stretched
and closed her eyes, going to sleep right there in her arms. </p>
<p>"Great, I'm the kid's giant security blanket," Sam complained.
Not that she actually minded. Inside she was touched. </p>
<p>"Could be worse, you could make her cry at the mere sight of
you," Nicole pointed out wryly. "Like the rest of us do." </p>
<p>"Gee, thanks Satan. Ever think of a career in counseling?" </p>
