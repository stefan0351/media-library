<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 5 -->

<p>The sound of the door shutting broke the spell that the room
was under. Buffy immediately then made her way to the door. She was
stopped by Riley's hand on her shoulder. "Buffy?" Her eyes were dazed
even as she focused on her boyfriend. "I, I have to talk to her."
Xander stood up. "That's gotta be what she wants!" "She wants Buffy
all right." Everyone turned to look at Anya. She seemed a bit
surprised at the scrutiny. "I was a vengeance demon, I know all about
the woman scorned and Faith has all the signs." Buffy shook her head.
"I didn't know." Xander spoke. "That doesn't justify what she's done!"
Giles spoke quietly. "She never said it did." </p>

<p>Xander shook his head. "It must be something about the
Hellmouth." While he wasn't even looking at Willow or Tara the redhead
gasped and the blonde's expression was blatantly hurt. Willow stood up
and turned Xander to face her. "What's that supposed to mean?" Xander
tried to shy away. "Nothing Will. I mean I'm glad you're happy." She
was up in his face as she replied. "I am Xander! For the first time
since Oz left I am happy, but that's not the issue is it? Not my
happiness, or Buffy's. You attacked every guy from Angel to Riley."
Xander's eyes rolled. "The souled vampire and the storm trooper. I'm
just keeping an eye on her." Willow rolled her eyes. "What about Oz?
He was everyone's friend and just ran into a werewolf, but you acted
like he signed on!"</p>

<p>He stepped away. "Yeah and then when he learned you had
someone new in your life he wolfed out and attacked her." Willow threw
her hands up. "At least he had his curse as an excuse! He also finally
understood that Tara makes me happy." Off to the side Tara was
blushing furiously but smiling just as much as Willow continued. "Do
you know what's the sad thing Xander. It's not the fact that we are
both girls. The one things most people would have a problem with
doesn't seem that much of an issue! You have your girlfriend, and she
seems to be keeping your very, VERY happy." Off to the side Anya
smirked at that as Willow invaded Xander's personal space further. "I
LOVE her Xander." Off to the side Tara gasped and looked around the
room as Willow looked back over her shoulder and smiled. "I do." Tara
looked around the room, looked down, and then looked back at Willow.
"I l… love you too."</p>

<p>Xander sank down next to Anya. "I don't see what this has to
do with Faith?" Willow's steps followed him. "It means this, until
Faith does something to hurt someone anything between her and Buffy is
between her and Buffy." Willow turned and sat back down next to Tara,
an action that didn't relieve the tensions in the room, but it stole
their focus. Buffy turned to Riley. "Riley, we'll talk later, right
now I need to talk to Faith." He looked confused. "Why? I mean her
feelings for you are just that, her feelings. They don't have anything
to do with you." Buffy looked shocked. "How can you say that?" His
expression still seemed confused. "Well it's not like you return them.
Do you?" Her eyes widened. "That doesn't matter!" He took her by the
elbows. "Do you?"</p>

<p>She yanked her arms free and turned towards the door while
speaking. "I have to find Faith." He looked as if he was ready to grab
her again, but didn't as she sped out of the door; it slamming shut
behind her. The object of her search was at another house, literally at
Buffy's doorstep. "Faith?" "Mrs. S" Faith could see the elder Summer's
apprehension and shook her head. "It's ok Mrs. S. I'm not here to hurt
anyone. I'm just here to apologize for what I've done then I'll be out
of your lives forever." Joyce's expression softened. "Won't you come
in?" Faith nodded slowly and followed Joyce into the house. "You know
then invitation thing only works on vampires?" The slayer's slightly
jesting tone made Joyce smile as she turned to face her.</p>

<p>"Look Mrs. S. I know it's not like anything I would say would
be enough, but I still had to say it. You know?" Joyce nodded silently
as Faith continued. "You were right. I really am unhappy, but that
still didn't give me the right to spread it around." Joyce looked at
Faith for several seconds. "I'm a mom, and I knew that deep down you
really wanted to be a good kid. I forgive you Faith." To her surprise
Faith was blinking back tears. "Look at me. I decide to turn my life
around and I turn into a fucking fire hose." She realized her cursing
at the last second and looked ready to apologize but Joyce dismissed
it with a smile. "You are finally expressing all the things you
bottled up. Buffy's says that a good cry is an essential slayer
skill." She noticed that Faith flinched at the mention of her
daughter's name. "Have you spoken to Buffy yet?" Faith simply nodded.
"It will be ok. Summer's women are notoriously stubborn, but she has
too kind a heart not to forgive you. She'll come around"</p>

<p>Faith shook her head. "She already did, pretty much, but some
things came up." Joyce scrunched her face in confusion. "Like what?"
Faith shook her head again. "Nothing, thank you Mrs. S. Now is that
part where I disappear into the night." Joyce stepped closer. "Do you
have to?" Faith nodded. "I think it's for the best." Joyce didn't seem
to agree but she followed Faith to the door. "If the night ever brings
you by again please stop by." The young woman nodded as she stepped
from the Summer's porch and walked into the night.</p>

<p>Her path took her back to the mansion where she immediately
walked to her bags and began packing. She was so focused on the goal
that she didn't hear Buffy as she stepped out from her hiding spot. It
was not until Buffy began to speak that Faith realized she was not
alone. "Running again?" Faith seized up in shock and a single word
escaped her lips. "Buffy." The released breath sounded like a prayer,
or perhaps a plea, but it vanished as she looked back over her
shoulder. "For me to run I would have to have something to run from.
Just moving on." Buffy stepped closer. "What about Giles?" She shook
her head. "He's busy being your watcher, and I think Wesley deserves a
second chance." Her back was to Buffy so she didn't see the blonde
force herself to stop shaking.</p>

<p>"What about… what you said?" Again Faith shook her head. "I
didn't say anything before, and I shouldn't have said anything now."
She then turned around and saw that Buffy was on the verge of tears.
"Please Buffy, don't cry. You've got a life. The American dream.
You're getting the education, you've got the friends, the family, hell
your dating GI Joe." Buffy laughed slightly at that. "The last thing
you need is a repentant head case dragging you along her road out of
hell." Buffy's head shook as she stepped closer to Faith. Faith looked
as if she wanted to step back but the couch was already right behind
her and blocking her way. "I already sent someone to hell. Now I'd
like a chance to help someone back." Faith tried to make a scoffing
sound. "Before or after you beat me to death?"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "Don't Faith." With no fear the smaller
slayer took the others hands in her own. "I was angry Faith. All the
times I reached out to you and you turned to Angel." Faith looked like
she wanted to speak but Buffy silenced her by slipping one of her
hands free from Faith's and placing it on Faith's lips. "It's ok. The
important thing is that you're back. Not how you got here." Both of
them were on the verge of tears as Faith nodded and Buffy pulled her
into an embrace. Buffy's voice was barely a whisper. "You're back."
They rested the foreheads together. They stood silently in each other
arms, and when they finally broke the embrace the both looked pained.
Buffy looked into Faith's eyes. "Welcome Home." The smaller slayer
already had a tear running down her cheeks, and that seemed to start
the other crying as well.</p>

<p>The tears were silent tears of joy however as they both smiled
at each other, until Faith blushed. "Buffy, about the other thing…"
Buffy again put a finger over Faith's lips. "I don't know about the
other thing, but WE will deal with it." Faith nodded slowly, smiling.
While both girls had parted there would not have been room to fit a
third person between them. Buffy looked down. "I left the rest of them
pretty quickly. I probably should go check on them." Faith nodded. "Go
be with your friends." Buffy paused. "I can't speak for Xander or
Riley, and Anya. Well you got more of a response from Anya then most
of us do. So that has to be a good sign." They both smiled at that. "I
do know you have me, Giles, Willow and Tara, and I'm sure mom will
welcome you back."</p>

<p>She saw the slightly guilty look on Faith's face. "Faith?"
Faith kept looking at the floor. "I talked to your mom. She's cool
with me now." Buffy smiled, then just as quickly she frowned. "I
really should go check on them. I'll see you later." Faith nodded.
"See you around B." Buffy shook her head. "No, see you later." She
paused to think. "Like tonight at seven for dinner?" Faith's eyes got
wide and she nodded silently. "I'm willing to bet you haven't eaten
since LA." Faith spoke quietly. "Haven't really been that hungry."
"Well ya gotta eat. Any idea what your hungry for?" Faith shook her
head and Buffy again paused. "Ok, how bout I pick you up here at seven
and then we decide?" Faith nodded. Buffy smirked as she left. "I think
we need to get some food in you. You're making Tara look chatty." The
last sight Buffy saw as she left was the mock look of indignation on
Faith's face.</p>
