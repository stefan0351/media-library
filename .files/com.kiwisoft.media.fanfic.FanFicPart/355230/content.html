<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Doing Time at the Palace -->

<p><i>eman·ci·pa·tion: the act or process of emancipating </i></p>
<p><i>eman·ci·pate: 1: to free from restraint, control, or the power of another; especially: to free from bondage</i></p>
<p><i>2: to release from paternal care and responsibility and make sui juris </i> </p>
<p><i>3: to free from any controlling influence (as traditional mores or beliefs)</i></p>

<p>&lt;Well, that?s at least according to Merriam Webster&gt; Brooke scoffed silently as she sat at her computer desk doing her homework a week after the last blow out with her dad.  And true to his word, she had not set foot outside the Palace without him as her assigned chaperone.  She had been pulled from Kennedy and now had a small army of highly expensive and well-trained tutors that came to the house on a strict schedule to teach her.  She felt like a prisoner in what used to be her home.  It was even to the point that she was having nightmares about her father forcing her to wear a drab white and black stripped jumpsuit so that she?d look that part.  She was seriously thinking of attempting to pull a ?Fugitive? while stuck in her own version of ?O Brother Where Art Thou??.</p>
<p>But every time she came close to slipping out of the house for good, her father?s last threat replayed itself in her mind. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;"Don?t think that I won?t hit you, Brooke.  Your little threat to call the police or whatever doesn?t scare me anymore.  Besides, I can find a lot worse things to do to you than hit you," Mike threatened.  Brooke arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Yeah?  Like what?" she challenged.  She wasn?t going to give him the satisfaction of knowing how scared she was. Mike?s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"Don?t try me, little girl.  Haven?t you ever wondered why your mother REALLY left me?" he hinted.  Brooke frowned in confusion. </p>
<p>"And don?t even THINK about running away again.  Every time you do, I will drag your sorry ass back here and think of worse ways to punish you.  Don?t try me, Brooke.  You don?t want to see what I am really capable of."&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Brooke was really starting to wonder what he meant by that.  Why did her mother<i>really </i>leave?  And what is Mike really capable of?  Her imagination was more than adequate in coming up with horrible images and ideas for that last one.  She couldn?t remember him ever being horrible or abusive growing up.  He always seemed to be on a somewhat even keel.  Yes, he got angry sometimes, but didn?t every parent?  She never thought anything about it.  Then came that night at her Aunt Terri?s when he went after Jane and then Brooke herself.  And Sam got in the way.  Brooke was no fool; she knew who her father?s intended targets were.  Sam was simply an innocent bystander who stepped into the path of a raging monster.  She never thought of her father that way until she saw the way that rage and fear twisted him.  He was no longer her father, but a stranger in his body.  She hated living with him.</p>
<p>Mike was running her life by a schedule now.  Meals were at a set time and if she missed them, she went hungry.   She was only allowed to watch TV at certain times and only certain shows.  ?Wholesome television?, as Mike so eloquently put it.  She was woken up at a certain time and expected to get up and stay up until the time he scheduled her to go to bed.  He had rearranged her wardrobe to suit what he felt her image was.  Brooke was getting tired of looking ?All-American/Amish? day in and day out.  She wasn?t allowed to wear make up anymore either.  Mike had thrown all that in the garbage the day after their fight.  He had also disconnected her computer and telephone lines and she was only allowed to use the main telephone line when he was present to supervise her.  When he wasn?t home, there was always someone else in the Palace at all times to watch her and make sure she behaved.  It was like being 17 and having a Nanny.  Brooke felt trapped and like she was suffocating.</p>
<p>Mike barely spoke to Brooke except to issue orders for the day and Brooke hardly spoke back to him, in any way.  She had no use for the man.  She saw him as her jailer, her warden and barely tolerated him simply because she had to.  When she wasn?t cursing the man?s very existence, she was desperately wishing for Sam?s presence.  She missed Sam even more now, especially since she?d had the chance to steal time when her father was unaware.  Being cut off from her brunette love completely made her insides hurt, almost a physical pain.  And now she couldn?t even vent to Lily how much she missed Sam.  She was cut off completely from her support system, now just treading water and quickly going under.</p>
<p>Brooke threw her pen down with a muffled curse and stood up to stretch her legs.  She paced around her room, her cell, as she liked to think of it now and was suddenly overcome by a fit of anger.  She started to throw things, stuffed animals, pictures, anything within reach; watching as they hit the wall and some broke upon impact.  She flung her chair over and ranted incoherently about the injustice that was her life.  Her blankets flew across the room as she ripped her bed to shreds and her voice rose in pitch.  Every bit of pent up anger and frustration bubbled to the surface and spilled over as Brooke tore apart her room.  She punched, she kicked, she threw and flung everything that at anytime meant anything to her in every direction.  She didn?t care anymore.  She was so angry and so hurt that she had to lash out at something.</p>
<p>When she was done, nothing in her room remained standing.  Her bed was now nothing but a frame, now standing on its side besides the upturned computer desk.  Feathers and other particles of miscellaneous items floated in the air as she stood panting and spent in the middle of the chaos.  With a long sigh she sank to her knees and took in the damage as a clear mind returned to her.  And then, she poured all her longing and fear, her hurt and love for Sam into a long, loud scream.</p>
<p>"SSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam watched Brooke?s whole tantrum from her hiding place nearby.  She had a perfect view of Brooke?s bedroom window from the bushes across the lawn.  She heard Brooke?s scream and it made her chest hurt to hear such desperation coming from the girl she loved so much.</p>
<p>&lt;Yup, missed my calling as a stalker&gt; Sam thought ruefully.  She then sighed.  &lt;Oh Brooke, I wish you weren?t so upset.  I wish there was a way to reach you, help you.  But if Mike catches me, I?m toast&gt;</p>
<p> She?d heard from Lily how Brooke had been pulled from school.  And then Terri had come with the news that Brooke was barred from leaving the house without Mike chained to her side.  It disturbed her that Mike was keeping poor Brooke on such a short leash.  And she felt guilty too.  If she had just done SOMETHING, she figured things wouldn?t be so bad.</p>
<p>&lt;I should have just kept my big mouth shut&gt; Sam thought angrily. &lt;Never said how I felt and then Mom and I would still be at the Palace and I would still be close to Brooke even if I didn?t have her love.  At least then Brooke would have her life and not be a prisoner.  There HAS to be a way to get her out of there, but how?&gt;</p>
<p>She pondered this dilemma as she watched Brooke resolutely begin to pick up the mess in her room.  Unable to stop herself, she climbed the short tree to Brooke?s window with effortless grace and knocked quietly on the frame.  Brooke jumped at the slight rap and spun to face the window.  Upon seeing Sam, her face lit up in surprise and joy.  She strode over to the window and flung it open.</p>
<p>"SAM!" she whispered, throwing a cautious look over her shoulder to her door. "What are you doing here?" Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"I had to see you," Sam said simply. "Brooke, I heard you scream.  Please don?t hurt like that," she said softly.  Brooke reached out the window and touched Sam?s face gently.</p>
<p>"I can?t help it, Sammy.  I miss you so much and this is so unfair.  I HATE living here like this." Sam tilted her head up and Brooke captured her lips in a passionate kiss.  </p>
<p>"I know," Sam sighed after they broke apart.  She took in the damage done to Brooke?s room. "Nice mess," she commented dryly.  Brooke looked around and then shrugged one shoulder.</p>
<p>"You like?  I?m thinking of redecorating it and calling it ?Raging Teen? or something equally as chic." They both laughed.</p>
<p>"Brooke!  What is going on in there?" Mike?s voice carried through the hardwood door.  The girls exchanged panicked looks.</p>
<p>"Nothing, Dad!" Brooke called over her shoulder.  She turned back to Sam. "Go, Sammy, before he sees you.  You have no idea how far over the deep end he?s gone."</p>
<p>"Will you be OK?" Sam asked, concern coloring her features as she started back down the tree.  Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes.  I?ll be fine, I promise.  I love you," she added.  Sam scooted back up and kissed Brooke again before disappearing out of the window.</p>
<p>"I love you too," she said with a smile. "And I?ll find a way to get you out of there, I promise."</p>
<p>"I know you will, Sammy.  Now go, here he comes," Brooke shooed her down the tree and shut the window just as Mike opened the door to her room.</p>
<p>"God, Mike, knock much?" she snapped at her father who glowered at her.</p>
<p>"I?m your father, I don?t have to knock.  All rooms in this house are mine and I can come and go as I see fit," he said haughtily.  Brooke put her hands on her hips and tilted her head.</p>
<p>"Oh really?  And what if I?d been naked?  Or masturbating with pictures of Sam, naked in suggestive poses?" Her teeth rattled with the force behind the slap she received from her father.  And then her hand tingled from hitting him just as hard.  She didn?t know what shocked her more, that he hit her or that her automatic reaction wasn?t shock or hurt, but to hit him back.</p>
<p>"Don?t you EVER strike me again," she growled lowly, her entire body trembling with anger and rage.  Mike was in a similar state.</p>
<p>"Don?t YOU ever speak to me that way and I won?t have reason to," he responded.  He looked at the destruction around her room. "And clean this up before morning?or else." He slammed the door behind him leaving Brooke alone again in her room.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Foster?" the receptionist knocked on the door and leaned her head in.  Kelly McQueen Foster looked up from the budget specks for the gallery and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes?" she asked.</p>
<p>"You have a visitor." Kelly nodded again.</p>
<p>"Send them in," she said absently going back to the budget.  Fully expecting to see a city councilman standing before her when she looked back up, she jumped in mild surprise when she saw the dour, raven-haired teen in the door.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Foster?  Remember me, Sam McPherson?" Sam asked quietly.  Kelly frowned.</p>
<p>"Brooke?s friend and stepsister, right?" she responded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam said.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you?  You?re a long way from home," Kelly pointed out putting the papers away and focusing on her visitor.  She knew something big had to be up for Sam to be standing in her doorway.  Besides, she had spoken to her sister Terri a bit not that long ago and knew things in her daughters life had changed somewhat.  But she and Terri weren?t on good terms so she hadn?t really been interested in returning her sister?s calls.  Sam shifted on her feet and bit her lip.</p>
<p>"I?m out of options and you?re the last thing I could think of.  We seriously need to talk about the state of your daughter?s welfare," Sam said solemnly. "Because something?s got to give before things get worse."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole sat flipping through the offers and paperwork that went with buying a house and frowned.  Her mind just wasn?t on the big picture and kept wandering from the subject at hand.  She wanted to buy a really nice house for her and Lily but she was having small nagging doubts.  They were starting to drive her buggy.</p>
<p>She put the papers off to the side and put her head on the table for a minute.  Jane was helping her translate the real estate mumbo-jumbo so she had no doubt that in the end, she?d get the best deal.  Not that money was even a remote issue.  She had more than enough for 6 lifetimes.  No, that wasn?t what was bothering her.</p>
<p>&lt;Is this really what Lily wants?&gt; Nicole wondered while letting the cool surface of the table seep into her skin.  It was calming. </p>
<p>&lt;I mean, she says it is.  But what if she?s just afraid of hurting my feelings?  I don?t want to buy a huge house to have her turn around and leave me alone in it.  A small apartment is all I personally need.  I don?t want to pressure her into something she?s not ready for.  I love her too much to do that to her.  I?d rather set her free than clip her wings&gt;</p>
<p>"Penny for your thoughts," Lily?s soft voice came from behind Nicole making her jump slightly.  She realized that she must have dozed off slightly to not hear Lily enter the room.</p>
<p>"Ah, I?m more expensive than that," she joked back with a long stretch.  Lily grinned and leaned in for a kiss, which Nic was more than happy to provide her with.</p>
<p>"Name your price," Lily purred as she pulled away.  She sat down and looked over at the papers on the table. "What?s that?" Nicole looked over at them and shrugged.</p>
<p>"Real estate crap.  Nothing to worry about.  I?m still shopping about," she said quietly.  Lily?s face lit up.</p>
<p>"Are we still going to go look at those houses this weekend?" she asked excitedly.  Nicole arched a pale brow.</p>
<p>"If you still want to," she responded nonchalantly.  Lily looked crestfallen. </p>
<p>"Do YOU not want to?" Lily wondered softly.  Nicole could hear the undercurrents of hurt and confusion in the Latina?s voice and cringed.</p>
<p>"Oh, I still do, Love.  I just wonder if YOU do," she tried to explain.  Lily looked at her obviously confused.</p>
<p>"Why would I not want to?  I don?t want to live with my uncle forever and I know you don?t want to live with the McPherson?s forever either," Lily said.  Nicole nodded.</p>
<p>"But do you really want to live with ME?" she asked in a soft voice.  Lily got up from her seat and crouched down next to Nicole?s seat.</p>
<p>"I love you, Nicole.  Of course I want to live with you.  Why are you doubting that now?" she asked her blonde lover in a gentle voice.  Nicole lifted her face to look at her, tears stubbornly refusing to fall down her face as she spoke.</p>
<p>"You were in love with Sam.  That?s how this whole thing started.  But Sam loves Brooke and turned you down.  And then Brooke finally caught on to how she felt about Sam and you lost her for good.  And then I come along, your former enemy and I profess my love for you and you just fell into that.  How can I not have my doubts, Lily?  I love you, but how can you go from loving Sam, your friend, to loving me, your enemy?" </p>
<p>"Oh, Niki," Lily sighed. "Brooke and Sam were once worst enemies too," she pointed out. "And I didn?t just ?fall? into anything.  I had to get to know you first.  Get to know who Nicole was outside of the bitch you pretended to be.  And that took time and effort but you trusted me enough to let me see that person.  And the more I saw of her, the more I liked her.  The more beautiful a person she became to me.  Yes, I loved Sam.  I won?t lie to you, part of me probably still does and always will.  She?s my best friend.  But I also love you.  I am in love with you." The tears rolled down Nicole?s face as Lily spoke and with each word, a bit more of Nicole?s insecurity was erased.  Lily brushed them away with her thumbs.</p>
<p>"I love you, Nicole.  I want to share a home, a life with YOU.  Not Sam," she assured the petite blonde.  Nicole wrapped her arms around Lily and held on tight.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she sobbed.</p>
<p>"I?d listen to her, Shorty," Terri said from the doorway.  She?d accidentally overheard the whole thing as she walked over to the kitchen.  Both teens looked up at the tall blonde.</p>
<p>"You two have something special.  Hold on to it," she advised.  The girls smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"We won?t," Nicole said firmly.  Jane walked into the kitchen and took in the scene.</p>
<p>"Are you harassing these two?" she asked Terri, a mock stern look on her face.  Terri put her hands up in surrender.</p>
<p>"Who me?  Never," she defended herself. "Besides, I don?t harass, I orate."</p>
<p>"Big word.  Hurt yourself?" Jane teased.  Terri stuck out her tongue while Nicole and Lily exchanged odd looks.  They watched the two adults exit the room and then shook their heads.</p>
<p>"NAHHHHH," they chorused together.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke examined the bruise on her face for several long minutes in the bathroom mirror.  Although it?d been days since the exchange with her father, the mark on her face was still stark and vibrant.  Since the phone was ?out of order? when her father wasn?t home, there was no way for Brooke to notify anyone about the incident and the tutors that came and went from the house were paid to ignore.  She thought it was a sad state of affairs when the persons supposedly watching out for today?s children could be bribed into silence even in this late day and age.</p>
<p>With a heavy sigh, she walked over to her desk calendar and flipped through to her ordained day of freedom, otherwise known as her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday.  The day, November 17<sup>th</sup>, was still 7 months away and she wasn?t sure she could survive the Wrath of Mike that long.  Survive without going AWOL or beating the man senseless with a frying pan was the question.  Option #2 was looking really good to her right now.</p>
<p>"Brooke, dinner," Mike barked from behind her door.  Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Not hungry," she responded.  The door opened and Mike walked in.  Brooke spun around and glared.</p>
<p>"Look, Mike would it kill you to give me a LITTLE personal privacy?  I?m obviously not going anywhere," she snapped.</p>
<p>"I trusted you and we saw what you did with that trust.  How am I supposed to ever trust you again?" he retorted.  Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Whatever," she sighed.  Mike walked over closer, invading Brooke?s personal space and making her nervous.</p>
<p>"Don?t take that tone with me, young lady," he warned.  "You have been nothing but smart mouthed and disobedient since we made this little arrangement.  You?d better start learning how to cooperate with me."  Brooke arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Or what?  You?ll hit me again?  God, when exactly DID you turn into such an abusive asshole?" Mike raised his hand to hit her again but Brooke stubbornly refused to flinch.  She would not give him the satisfaction of knowing that she was scared.  Mike lowered his hand and leaned in even closer.</p>
<p>"Brooke," he ground out slowly. "Up until now, we?ve gone your entire life without me ever having to get this way.  You always behaved, unlike your mother.  Everyone has a certain place in the world and sometimes they have to be taught where that place is.  Don?t make me have to teach you your place and how to behave like I did your mother."  Brooke took a step away from her father and stared at him.</p>
<p>"Exactly what DID you do?" she finally asked, shivering slightly as her own imagination did the work for her and gave her ideas of what he could possibly mean.  Mike simply shrugged.</p>
<p>"I?d rather not talk about it.  And I really don?t want to have to demonstrate.  Let?s leave it at that.  Now, you are coming down to dinner.  Now," he ordered.  Sighing in resignation, Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Lead the way, Adolph."</p>
