<p><b>A/N:</b> Sorry this took so long. I have to be in the right mindset (loopy) to write this story, and I've been really stressed lately. Anyway, I hope you enjoy, and, by popular demand, it's…</p>
<p><b>Twister</b></p>
<p>"It needs to be something Rachel and Quinn can play without moving," Kurt pondered.</p>
<p>"They're playing their own game," Santana said dismissively.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but eventually they're going to get bored just sitting there," Mercedes said sympathetically.</p>
<p>"Then get off the damn chair."</p>
<p>"We can play a board game if someone moves our pieces," Rachel offered.</p>
<p>"But you don't have any board games besides chess, Monopoly, and Scene It," Artie said.</p>
<p>"And no one wants to play Monopoly with twelve people," Tina added.</p>
<p>"There wouldn't be any money left," Mike agreed.</p>
<p>"I still think Hangman is a viable option," Matt said.</p>
<p>"Again, there are <i>twelve</i> people here. We can't play a two-person game with twelve people," Santana growled.</p>
<p>"Maybe everyone could get turns guessing," Puck suggested, shrugging.</p>
<p>"That completely destroys the point of the game," Mercedes said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"No one would win," Kurt agreed.</p>
<p>Quinn and Rachel tuned out the argument again. Rachel shivered.</p>
<p>"What are you <i>doing</i> back there?" she hissed.</p>
<p>Quinn shrugged. "Writing on your back. I didn't know you weren't wearing a bra. The argyle must distract from it."</p>
<p>Rachel blushed. "Yes, well, when I get home, I like to relax. …What are you writing anyway? Was that a heart?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But I can't decide what I heart."</p>
<p>"You could heart glee."</p>
<p>"Hm. Okay."</p>
<p>Rachel felt Quinn swipe the 'g' and the 'l' with her finger before she realized someone had asked her something.</p>
<p>"Sorry, what?"</p>
<p>"Do. You. Have. Cards?" Kurt repeated impatiently.</p>
<p>"I do, but what would we play?"</p>
<p>"Go Fish," Brittany said.</p>
<p>"Poker," Puck suggested.</p>
<p>"B.S.," Santana offered.</p>
<p>"Hearts," Matt added.</p>
<p>"Euchre," Mike tacked on.</p>
<p>"Bridge," Mercedes said.</p>
<p>"First of all, most of those games require a total of four people, or less. Second, I don't have any poker chips, and as Noah pointed out earlier, we can't use food because no one would want to eat it but me. And I'm sorry, Brittany, but I think Go Fish would be rather difficult for Quinn and I to play at the moment," Rachel said apologetically.</p>
<p>"Although this position <i>would</i> make it easier for me to cheat," Quinn pointed out.</p>
<p>"Back to square one," Finn said, sighing.</p>
<p>"You cheat at Go Fish?" Rachel was aghast.</p>
<p>Quinn laughed. Rachel shivered.</p>
<p>"What about Twister?" Tina suggested tentatively.</p>
<p>Puck grinned. "Marry me."</p>
<p>She gaped. "What?"</p>
<p>"On second thought, don't. You can't chain me down. Still, you're a goddess for picking that game."</p>
<p>Tina blushed. Artie glared at him.</p>
<p>"Do you even have that?" Kurt asked, sighing.</p>
<p>"In the upstairs closet on the second shelf in the far back," Rachel recited.</p>
<p>Finn lumbered to go get it.</p>
<p>"But Artie can't play it, and I don't think everyone will fit on the mat," she said uncertainly.</p>
<p>"You two can't participate anyway," Mercedes pointed out. "You guys can work the spinner."</p>
<p>"It doesn't take three people to spin a plastic arrow."</p>
<p>"I could check to make sure no one's knees or elbows are touching the mat," Artie offered.</p>
<p>"And I can make sure you're calling the shots right," Quinn said.</p>
<p>Rachel frowned. "And if you believe I'm not?"</p>
<p>Quinn tickled up her sides again and Rachel batted her hands away, squealing.</p>
<p>"And you thought the slushies were bad," Kurt commented.</p>
<p>"All right, found it," Finn announced, carrying the box to the middle of the room.</p>
<p>"Did you know that Twister was actually extremely controversial when it was first released?" Rachel asked. Everyone groaned. "No, seriously. People thought the company was selling 'sex in a box.'"</p>
<p>"I don't think two people could fit in that box," Brittany said, eyeing it.</p>
<p>"It was one of the first games to use human pieces," Rachel continued.</p>
<p>"It would be hard to have sex in a box," Matt said suddenly.</p>
<p>"Damn near impossible," Puck agreed.</p>
<p>Mike frowned in thought. "Maybe if you had one of those big moving boxes for like a refrigerator."</p>
<p>"You three are appalling," Rachel said sagely.</p>
<p>"I think I'm offended," Matt said, and Mike nodded.</p>
<p>Puck scowled. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Well, do you ever think about anything other than sex?"</p>
<p>Crickets.</p>
<p>"I thought about sex the other day," Mercedes said abruptly.</p>
<p>"Me, too. But then I had a math test," Tina said wistfully.</p>
<p>"That'll do it."</p>
<p>"You should get pregnant," Quinn said wryly. "You will never stop thinking about it. And if you do, you'll be thinking about food."</p>
<p>"Hold on a minute. I thought you said girls want sex just as much as guys do," Finn said, drooping.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean we think about it twenty-four seven," Rachel replied.</p>
<p>"Are we ready yet?" Santana asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"We have been. Almost since Finn got here with it," Kurt said.</p>
<p>"Fine, let's do this."</p>
<p>"Spinner, please," Rachel said.</p>
<p>Finn handed it over and they lined up around the mat.</p>
<p>"Are we going alphabetically?" Tina asked curiously.</p>
<p>Rachel glanced back at Quinn, who shrugged.</p>
<p>"Sure." She spun. "Brittany, right foot, blue."</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"I love this game," Puck said happily, behind Santana.</p>
<p>"I can really tell," Santana replied, scowling. "Rachel, if you don't get me the hell out of this position, I will drag you out of that damn chair."</p>
<p>"Just wait, and I'll do my best. It's Mike's turn." She spun again. "Okay, left hand red."</p>
<p>"I officially hate this game," Kurt groaned. "You need to use deodorant. And also? Someone needs to fall already!"</p>
<p>"We've made a giant pretzel," Mercedes observed, leg over Finn's arm.</p>
<p>"An orgy pretzel," Brittany added from under Santana.</p>
<p>"At least no one's naked," Finn said, wincing at Matt's ankle.</p>
<p>"That would be awkward," he agreed.</p>
<p>"And hot," Puck said, grinning.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at him.</p>
<p>"But only if it was the girls!" he exclaimed. "God!"</p>
<p>"Methinks the man whore doth protest too much," Quinn said, smirking.</p>
<p>Puck glared. "You getting tired over there, Quinn?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Well, you just look so exhausted resting on Rachel's shoulder like that."</p>
<p>She shot up and Rachel frowned.</p>
<p>"I'm not tired," Quinn snapped.</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"If you two are done subtexting, could we please move on before my wrist breaks?" Kurt asked. "Please?"</p>
<p>Rachel sighed. "Right. Santana, left hand green."</p>
<p>"That is impossible."</p>
<p>She promptly fell, taking Brittany with her.</p>
<p>"See?" They squirmed out of the pile to the sidelines.</p>
<p>"Sorry. The spinner goes where it pleases."</p>
<p>"It might be more fun if you were diabolical and shouted out instructions that would <i>make</i> them fall," Artie said.</p>
<p>They stared at him.</p>
<p>"Or, you know, this way is fun, too."</p>
<p>"Anyway…. Tina, left hand yellow."</p>
<p>"You know, I do use deodorant," Mike muttered.</p>
<p>"What brand?" Kurt asked.</p>
<p>"Axe."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no, no. No," Mercedes said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Finn, right hand yellow."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"What's wrong with Axe?" Mike asked defensively.</p>
<p>"You know how in the commercials the women can't stop fawning over and-or eating him?" Santana retorted.</p>
<p>"Yeah…."</p>
<p>"That's pretty much the exact opposite of what actually happens."</p>
<p>"That's why I had to switch," Puck said, nodding. "It was killing my game."</p>
<p>"And it helped that I threatened to spray you in the eyes with my perfume if you didn't switch."</p>
<p>"That, too."</p>
<p>"Kurt, left hand red."</p>
<p>"Whew. Escape from the smell."</p>
<p>"So what do you guys suggest?" Mike asked. "Like, what's a good scent or whatever?"</p>
<p>Quinn sighed absently. "Cinnamon and vanilla."</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat. "Or…Old Spice?"</p>
<p>"Matt, your elbow is touching the mat!" Artie exclaimed triumphantly.</p>
<p>They all stared at him again.</p>
<p>"What?" He looked at Tina. "Did I miss something?"</p>
<p>"Quinn's just getting sleepy over there again," Puck commented.</p>
<p>"You know, if the spinner lands on right hand yellow for you, you'll be in your favorite position," Quinn growled.</p>
<p>He glanced down at Kurt. "Point taken. Lips are zipped."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>"I still feel like I'm missing something," Artie said, frowning.</p>
<p>"You're not the only one," Rachel assured him. "But Quinn, I'm flattered that you like my soap scents, since you don't seem to like anything else I do as far as feminizing myself goes."</p>
<p>"You are stupid," Santana said flatly, and Quinn glared at her.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
<p>"Spin, woman, spin!" Kurt yelped.</p>
<p>"Finn," Rachel whined, and he blinked.</p>
<p>"What? Oh! Hey, Santana, don't call my girlfriend stupid."</p>
<p>"You are, too."</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>"As soon as we're done with this game, I'm taking spinning rights away from you, Berry," Kurt muttered.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry, Kurt. Mercedes, right foot green."</p>
<p>"Yeah, baby." Puck grinned.</p>
<p>"You're not even in a good viewing area, and I'm wearing pants," she pointed out, frowning at him.</p>
<p>"I have a good imagination."</p>
<p>"He does. He called me 'Leia' when we used to do it," Brittany said, nodding sagely.</p>
<p>He turned red when everyone stared at him.</p>
<p>"Not from '<i>Star Wars</i>.' Just some…hot chick I dated this one time."</p>
<p>"You have a '<i>Star Wars</i>' fetish," Mercedes taunted, grinning.</p>
<p>"Hey, Brit, did he make you dress up, too?" Mike asked, giggling.</p>
<p>"He gave me this gold bikini once. I still have it. San and I use it for bondage."</p>
<p>There was another awkward silence, and Rachel glanced back at Quinn before clearing her throat.</p>
<p>"Puck has a '<i>Star Wars</i>' fetish," Matt chanted, and they all joined in.</p>
<p>"Shut up! She is <i>hot</i>, okay? I don't like the actual movie," Puck growled. "I am so kicking you guys's asses when we're done with this game."</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, spin the stinking arrow, Rachel!" Kurt interrupted. "I am going to die."</p>
<p>"If it hurts that bad, just drop, dude," Finn suggested. "It's no big deal."</p>
<p>"Mike, right foot blue," Rachel said.</p>
<p>He ended up taking Tina and Kurt out with him.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Kurt said, plopping next to Brittany.</p>
<p>"Sweet. Now all we gotta do is get rid of Finn, babe," Puck said, waggling his eyebrows at Mercedes.</p>
<p>"I really thought you were done being into me," she replied.</p>
<p>"Puck is never done being into anything female," Quinn pointed out. "Except, of course, if you kick him in the crotch."</p>
<p>Mercedes grinned. "I'll keep that in mind."</p>
<p>Puck glowered. "Getting tired again, Quinn?"</p>
<p>She opened her mouth, but Rachel said, "Would you stop saying that to her? Every time you do, she sits up, and she's being my blanket. Do you want me to be cold?"</p>
<p>Finn frowned in confusion. Puck grinned.</p>
<p>"'Course not, babe. But I think maybe she should cuddle up closer in that case. You're looking pretty nippy to me."</p>
<p>She turned crimson. "Puck, left hand green."</p>
<p>"Aw, come on, that's just cruel."</p>
<p>"Sorry, the spinner calls the shots."</p>
<p>"You're just—oof!"</p>
<p>"And you're out," Artie said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Why don't you get yourself a cookie or something, Puck?" Quinn asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"Mike ate them all," he reminded her.</p>
<p>"Then I'll buy you one tomorrow," she replied.</p>
<p>"Down to you and Mercedes, Finn," Kurt said, smirking. "Think you can handle it?"</p>
<p>"Bring it," he said, and everyone started cheering.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>Mercedes won. Finn ended up having to cross his legs and his arms, which just didn't work out so well.</p>
<p>"That was fun," Kurt said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"You complained through half of it," Santana pointed out.</p>
<p>He shrugged. "It was still fun."</p>
<p>"New game?" Tina asked quietly. "Or another round?"</p>
<p>"I think we should play Truth or Dare next," Puck said, grinning. "Always save the best for last."</p>
<p>"Who says the next game is the last one?" Artie asked.</p>
<p>"No one. That's why I'm saving Seven Minutes in Heaven."</p>
<p>"You're strange," he said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Puck shrugged. "What can I say? I'd like to get <i>some</i> at this party."</p>
<p>"What if you end up in there with a guy?" Mercedes asked.</p>
<p>He paled. "Maybe it should be opposite sex partners only."</p>
<p>"That's not fair," Brittany said, pouting.</p>
<p>"Yeah, how am <i>I</i> supposed to get any with that rule?" Santana growled.</p>
<p>"Okay, Quinn, you win!" Rachel squeaked, springing out of the chair.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at her.</p>
<p>"I thought we should quit that silly game so we can get in a round of Twister. After all, it's only fair that we get to participate in one, since we did all the spinning work. And perhaps Kurt and Mercedes wouldn't mind being in charge of spinning this time, since she won this round and Kurt's shoulder was about to go out, would you guys mind?"</p>
<p>The staring continued.</p>
<p>"Um…I guess not."</p>
<p>"Great! Let's play!"</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"Rachel, right hand green," Mercedes said.</p>
<p>She paled. "What?"</p>
<p>"You heard her. Right hand green," Santana said, grinning.</p>
<p>She, Quinn, Rachel, and Mike were the only ones left on the mat. Rachel glared at her and moved. Right on top of Quinn. She turned beet red.</p>
<p>"Okay, Santana, left foot blue," Kurt called out.</p>
<p>Quinn was biting her lip, trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>"Why are you laughing?" Rachel hissed.</p>
<p>"You should see your face," she whispered back.</p>
<p>"Well, this position isn't exactly…."</p>
<p>"Mike, right hand blue," Mercedes said. He fell.</p>
<p>"You didn't mind so much with Finn," Quinn muttered.</p>
<p>"That's because he—never mind."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Tell me."</p>
<p>"No, it's nothing important."</p>
<p>"Do I look like I have anything better to do?"</p>
<p>Rachel blushed harder.</p>
<p>"Quinn, right foot yellow," Kurt instructed.</p>
<p>She hooked her leg around Rachel's.</p>
<p>"Tell me," she sing-songed.</p>
<p>"It's <i>nothing</i>."</p>
<p>"If it was nothing, you wouldn't have said anything."</p>
<p>"Rachel, left foot yellow," Mercedes interrupted.</p>
<p>She crossed her legs and promptly fell flat on Quinn. There was an awkward pause and she leapt up.</p>
<p>"Okay, Santana wins, who wants to play Truth or Dare?" Rachel squeaked.</p>
<p>Quinn smirked.</p>
