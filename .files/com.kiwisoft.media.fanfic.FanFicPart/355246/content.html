<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Trial by Fire -->

<p>"Therefore it is the finding of this court that primary
custody of MacKenzie McPherson McQueen is granted to her mother, Jane
McPherson," the judge announced. Jane breathed a sigh of relief and
hugged her attorney as Mike shot daggers at her from his
table. "Visitation for the father, Mike McQueen, is to be supervised
and must be arranged to meet with Mrs. McPherson's schedule."</p>
<p>"As for the matter concerning Brooke Elizabeth McQueen," the
judge cleared his throat. "I never like to take a child away from
their parent. But in some cases, it becomes necessary for the
benefit and health of the child. Ms McQueen will be turning 18 in
the near future and at that time can decide on her own what is best
for her. Until then, this court finds that her home situation is too
harmful for her to be placed back into and upon the wishes of her own <br>
mother, Kelly McQueen Foster, temporary custody is granted to Jane
McPherson until the child's 18th birthday." The gavel banged loudly
and the judge walked out.</p>
<p>Brooke let out a happy `whoop' and hugged Sam tightly,
relieved beyond words that she wasn't being returned to her abusive
father. She would have run off again, that much she was sure of and
had already planned to do as much with Sam beforehand. But
thankfully, the court case had gone smoothly with her father's own
theatrics doing more harm to him than the girl's testimony. He had
ranted and raved on about Sam and her `evil corruption' of Brooke;
how she'd kidnapped his daughter and was a bad influence on his
infant daughter Mac. He then defended his abusive actions as the
right of a parent to protect his children. When he'd said that, the
judge had all but sneered and laughed directly at him.</p>
<p>"Oh thank God," Jane breathed. She turned to the four teens
sitting behind her. All four faces were lit up in happiness and she
smiled in return.</p>
<p>"I told you that it'd work out, Mrs. McPherson," Nicole piped
up, confident as always. </p>
<p>"Yes, you did, Nicole. And thank you so much for helping
with my legal fees. I don't know how I'm going to pay you back,"
Jane started only to have Nicole wave her off.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. You don't have to. Besides, we knew
Mike was going to pay for top-notch representation; it was only far
that you be on equal ground. Plus there was no WAY I was letting
Brookie go back with him while there was still money in my bank
account," Nic said seriously. And secretly, her contingency plan had
custody been returned to Mike was to ship Brooke and Sam out of the
country until Brooke was 18. She'd go broke before that madman was
ever allowed near Brooke alone again. Or Sam for that matter,
although she'd deny that part if asked.</p>
<p>"Still, Nicole, thank you. You've changed so much," Jane
pointed out. "I guess Lily's good for you." Nicole blushed in spite
of herself.</p>
<p>"OK, time for a subject change," she said hastily, feeling
uncomfortable with the favorable attention. "Who wants to go out to
celebrate? My treat?" </p>
<p>"What's the matter, Satan? Did we get too touchy-feely for
you?" Sam teased. Nicole shot her a dirty look and stuck out her
tongue. </p>
<p>"Huggies for Nicole!" Sam announced and pounced on a
horrified Nicole. Brooke, Lily, Jane, Terri and a drooling Mac, who
was in Brooke's arms, joined her.</p>
<p>"Ug stop, stop," Nicole protested weakly. "Ew Spam cooties."</p>
<p>"You think you've won," Mike snarled as he walked out with
his attorney.</p>
<p>"Mike," his rather burly attorney, Todd, warned. "Stop, let's
just leave. This isn't going to help." Mike's eyes narrowed and he
glared hotly at Jane.</p>
<p>"Those are MY daughters. They belong with ME, not you.
Especially Brooke, you have NO right to her." </p>
<p>"Mr. McQueen," Jane's attorney, Nancy, started. "You are way out of
line." Jane put her hand on woman's arm, pushed her chair back and
stood right in Mike's face.</p>
<p>"YOU have no right to either of them," she hissed at Mike.
She had something to say and since Mike had given her the opening,
she was going to use it. "You proved exactly how unworthy you are of
being a parent the first time you ever raised your hand to Brooke and
Sam. I will NEVER let you have custody of Mac. As for Brooke, I
will fight you for her up until and long after her 18th birthday.
She is more a daughter to me than she ever was to you. You see your
daughters as property, not individuals that need to be loved and
guided. I will NOT let you corrupt or abuse ANY of my children."</p>
<p>Behind her, Brooke felt her heart swell with happiness and a
sense of belonging as she heard Jane's words. She knew the woman
loved her like she was her own daughter but still, hearing how far
Jane was willing to go to protect and keep custody of her made Brooke
feel wanted and loved. </p>
<p>`My own mother may have abandoned me, but Jane is a better
mother than Kelly could have ever hoped to be,' she thought to
herself.</p>
<p>"All this never would have happened if it wasn't for HER!"
Mike growled, thrusting an accusing finger at Sam. Sam had to resist
the urge to bite the digit clean off. She felt Brooke's free hand
come to rest on the small of her back in silent comfort.</p>
<p>"Stop blaming Sam for your shortcomings as an individual!"
Jane countered.</p>
<p>"Brooke, hand me Mac and I'll take her to the Ladies Room,"
Lily whispered. Brooke nodded as Mac started to become distressed at
the argument between the loud adults. Nicole followed Lily and Mac
out, holding up her cell-phone to Brooke as she reached the door,
signifying to call if they need her. </p>
<p>"Look, Mike, this really isn't the place to get into this,"
Sam tried to calm the situation even as Mike's attorney agreed.</p>
<p>"Mike, she's right. Let's just go plan our appeal?"</p>
<p>"I wish you'd never come into our lives, Samantha," Mike
snapped.</p>
<p>"And if it wasn't worth having Brooke and Mac in MY life, I
could have done without YOU," Sam snapped back. "You're a self-righteous, abusive, egotistical, narrow-minded bigot."</p>
<p>"You corrupted my daughter," Mike said darkly.</p>
<p>"I AM NOT THE BAD GUY!" Sam screamed, her frustration getting
the better of her.</p>
<p>"Sammy, calm down," Brooke said softly. She turned to her
father. "I'm not going over this again, Mike. I love Sam. Either
deal with it or don't, I don't care. But stop blaming her for
something she had no control over. As for the rest, we're leaving.
You lost, live with it." She put her arm around Sam's shoulders and
they headed out.</p>
<p>Mike reached out to stop her but was held back by Todd.</p>
<p>"Don't make this worse, Mike," Todd advised. "We still have
grounds for appeal, don't blow it because you're upset." Mike
shrugged off the other man's hold.</p>
<p>"Jane?" Mike started, his tone full of warning if not
outright threat. Jane deliberately ignored him and went to catch her
daughter's. Terri stopped and looked Mike straight in the eye.</p>
<p>"I never did like you, Michael. Thank you for proving why,"
she said flatly.</p>
<p>"Fuck off, Terri, this is none of your business," Mike
ordered.</p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong, Mike. It is MY business when it
concerns my family. And not only Brooke but that entire group is my
family now. You mess with them and you mess with me. And if memory
serves me right, Mike, you never were much of a match for me, were
you?" Terri smirked.</p>
<p>"Go back to Texas where you're wanted," Mike spat. Terri
tilted her head slightly.</p>
<p>"I'll say this slowly so that you don't miss any of it, Mike:
leave?them?alone," her voice was laced with unspoken menace. Then
with a smile, she left. Nancy followed with a tired sigh.</p>
<p>"Mike," Todd started. "You are one hell of a screw up."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Hold still, Sam, so that the drops get in," Brooke
instructed as she tried to put Sam's ear drops in. She swore that
sometimes Sam squirmed worse than a cat when it was time for her
medicine.</p>
<p>Sam sat as still as she could, fidgeting under Brooke's
tender touch. She didn't mean to, it was just that the drops stung
and putting water in her ears and tilting her head tended to make her
dizzy.</p>
<p>"There, all done," Brooke announced. Sam closed her eyes as
the bedroom spun.</p>
<p>"Whoa, trippy," she groaned. Brooke put the medicine away
and then sat down on the bed, pulling Sam to her. Sam relaxed into
the embrace, resting her head against Brooke's soft cottony shirt.</p>
<p>"Still dizzy, baby?" Brooke soothed while petting Sam's hair
lovingly.</p>
<p>"A little, not as bad though," Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"At least you're getting better and can eat now. I was getting so
worried," Brooke admitted.</p>
<p>"I know, hon. I'm so sorry I worried you," Sam apologized.</p>
<p>"It's OK, Sammy. I understand. But next time?"</p>
<p>"Next time I'll tell you when I'm sick and maybe even go to the
doctor,"
Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"I'll drag your ass there kicking and screaming," Brooke informed her
making them both laugh.</p>
<p>"I know. Trust me, babe, I know." She then giggled as a wayward
thought struck her.</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke asked. Sam looked up into Brooke's hazel
eyes, a smirk curling the ends of her lush lips upward.</p>
<p>"The judge said that I get to keep you," she said in a
conspiring tone. Brooke's eyebrow raised slightly.</p>
<p>"Oh really?" Sam nodded and licked her lips.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're aaalllllll mine." She captured Brooke's lips in
a searing kiss, reveling in their soft feel and in Brooke's ardent
response.</p>
<p>"And what do you plan to do with me?" Brooke asked huskily
when she managed to disengage her lips from Sam's ever so tempting
ones. Sam's eyes went black with desire.</p>
<p>"What do you WANT me to do?" Sam responded as she licked
Brooke's neck.</p>
<p>"Oh God, Sammy," Brooke whimpered, her breath hitching and
her heart hammering in her chest. Her mind raced with a myriad of
images of exactly how she wanted to answer that but the words were
suddenly stuck in her throat as Sam nipped at her ear.</p>
<p>"Whatever you want?" came out of her mouth, sounding more
like a prayer and she heard Sam chuckle.</p>
<p>"Aw, that takes all the fun out of it," Sam chided. "Well,
not really," she added after a beat with a slight leer at the blonde
beneath her. "I can think of some things?I just wanted to hear what
YOU wanted."</p>
<p>Brooke didn't answer verbally, just lost herself in the feel
of Sam. Lost herself in the sensation of lips and hands, teeth and
tongue, bare skin on bare skin; the sounds of pleasure both from
herself and Sam erupting from their mouths surrounding them. She
lost herself in the heat and the sweat, the need and the want, desire
and love all combining in the intimate dance the two girls shared
until they fell asleep still wrapped around each other and tangled in
the sheets.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Jane swirled her spoon around in her coffee, watching the
bronze liquid swirl within in the cup aimlessly. She wasn't really
watching what she was doing; she was too deep in thought. Despite
winning custody of the girl's on paper, she was still uneasy. Mike
had proven himself too unstable in the past to think that a simple
piece of paper declaring custody was going to slow him down anymore
than the restraining orders did.</p>
<p>`He marched right through those. Almost attacked Sam again.
God knows what would have happened that day if not for Brooke's quick
thinking and the neighbors.' She sighed and set the spoon on the
table, moving to rub the tense muscles in her back.</p>
<p>"Here, let me," Terri said as she entered the kitchen. She
reached down and gently massaged Jane's shoulders, feeling the coiled
and bunched muscles under her hands.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Jane said softly. After a few minutes, Terri sat
down across from Jane at the table and watched the other woman
compose herself as her thoughts still tried to pull at her.</p>
<p>"Well, at least that's one thing out of the way," she said as
Jane took a sip of her cooled coffee and shrugged.</p>
<p>"I guess. But I just can't get it in my head that Mike can
be trusted. Do you think I'm being paranoid?" Jane asked. Terri
shook her head.</p>
<p>"Not at all," she responded. "Look, I never really got 100%
of the story from Kelly about what went on between her and Mike but,
Jane, he's not a pillar of stability. That much is obvious. And if
you're uneasy about what he might do about Brooke and Mac, then it's
only because you're a good parent and worried about your children."</p>
<p>"I'm worried about Sam too. His hatred for her is
unbelievable," Jane pointed out. The rage she saw in Mike's eyes
whenever he looked at or spoke to Sam scared Jane, making her wonder
what he might be capable of.</p>
<p>"He won't go after Sam and risk his appeal for custody,"
Terri said hoping that she was right. </p>
<p>`Surely Mike isn't THAT stupid?' she wondered.</p>
<p>"That's just it, Ter, we don't know," Jane put her head in
her hands and tried not to cry out of frustration with the whole
situation. Terri nodded her silent agreement.</p>
<p>"But we're all looking out for him to do something so, he
won't catch us unaware, Jane."</p>
<p>"We can hope not. But I'm not going to live my life in fear
because of that man," Jane declared.</p>
<p>"I'm not suggesting that you do," Terri countered. "I'm just
saying to be alert and take the necessary precautions to keep the
kids safe."</p>
<p>"Good idea. So, while we were in Texas you said you were
going to head home after the verdict," Jane said, changing
subjects. "Is that still your plan?"</p>
<p>The question threw Terri off-balance for a minute. She
wasn't expecting Jane to take such a direct route in her
questioning. She shrugged.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to go? Because I know I'm kind of a mooch
around here," she said with a self-deprecating smile. Jane shook her
head.</p>
<p>"Actually, Theresa, I'd like it if you stayed," Jane admitted
quietly. "I like having you here."</p>
<p>"Then here I'll stay," Terri declared, immensely pleased that
she was welcome. "My Pumpkin-nose means the world to me and I like
being here for her. And you and Sam, and little Mac have come to
mean a lot to me, too. And if you want me here, then I'll stay. I
just don't want to overstay my welcome or crowd you."</p>
<p>"You aren't," Jane assured the tall blonde. "God, Terri, I
don't know how I would have gotten this far without your support.
You've been so good to the girl's. And it's just nice having another
adult around to talk to."</p>
<p>Terri reached out and placed her hand over Jane's.</p>
<p>"Anything you need, just let me know."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You're tense, Niki," Lily said quietly. "What's wrong?" She
watched the tense outline of her lover's jaw line twitch with
suppressed tension as they lay together in bed.</p>
<p>"Nothing, Angel, go to sleep," Nic responded with a sigh.
Lily moved and put her head on Nicole's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Come on, talk to me," Lily urged.</p>
<p>"It's nothing. It's just?grrr?it's just my Mom. She's
poking around in my Trust Fund and it's pissing me off," Nicole
explained. Lily's head popped up.</p>
<p>"WHAT? That bitch," she growled making Nicole smile.</p>
<p>"Easy, Lil. She can't touch the money, Nana made damn sure
of that. The old bag's hired some attorneys to go through the
clauses line by line to see if there are any loopholes so that she
can take it from me. But unless Nana included one that says `Nicole
must not be gay' there isn't anything she can do. The money is mine,
plain and simple."</p>
<p>"Why can't she just leave you be?" Lily asked, a bit angered
and hurt that Nicole's mother was still a thorn in their side.</p>
<p>"Because that woman can not stand to lose, at anything. And
now that we're out on our own, she can't lie about us and say that
we're `just friends', Lil. There's no hiding the fact that we're
lovers, in love. She can't hide it from her society friends and
she's still worried about her reputation."</p>
<p>"She's a dumbass," Lily joked. Nicole laughed.</p>
<p>"Yup," she agreed.</p>
<p>"So when did you find out she was doing this?" Nicole blew
out a blast of air through her teeth.</p>
<p>"A while now. Shortly after we bought the house, my attorney
called and said he'd been faxed about some `questions'," she admitted
knowing it was going to annoy Lily to have been left out of the loop
for so long.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p>`Yup, there's that hurt tone of voice that I hate hearing
from her, especially when I cause it,' Nicole berated herself.</p>
<p>"I just did," she said cheerfully trying to disarm the
argument she was afraid was forming.</p>
<p>"Nicole?" Lily warned. Nicole sighed again.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, baby. I just?I don't want that woman casting a
dark shadow over our happiness and I thought by not telling you, that
at least YOU wouldn't have to worry about it."</p>
<p>Lily was touched by the reasoning behind the gesture but it
still wasn't the way she wanted their relationship to be.</p>
<p>"Niki, this is a partnership, pretty much a marriage. Your
problems are my problems and vice versa. I don't want you to worry
about upsetting me with things like this. Things like this you share
so that we can figure them out, OK?" she patiently explained.</p>
<p>"So you're not mad?" Nicole asked a little fearfully.</p>
<p>"Not at all, honey. I understand why you didn't tell me.
Just, next time, TELL ME," Lily cuddled closer. Nicole wrapped her
arms around her.</p>
<p>"Promise."</p>
