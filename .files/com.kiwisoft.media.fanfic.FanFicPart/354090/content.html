<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 23 -->

<p>Brooke carefully exited her room, checking to see if the hallway was clear
before making her way out into the hall and over to Sam's room. Checking the
knob she found the door open and slipped inside noiselessly.   Sam was
standing in front of her mirror, her back turned to Brooke, and the blonde
leaned against the door she had just closed with a smile and observed the
other girl with a soft smile on her face.  Sam was dressed semi-casually-as
Brooke had suggested so they won't draw too much attention when leaving the
house-and standing there watching her brush her hair Brooke was certain that
if she wasn't already entirely in love with Sam she would have fallen for
her watching her there in the pale light and peace of the moment.</p>

<p>"In civilized society it's considered customary to knock before entering
someone's private space," Sam drawled lazily, not for a moment stopping her
actions.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled wider and made her way over to her girlfriend.  "If someone
had been ready on time, this barbarous act would need not have been
commented," she responded stopping slightly behind Sam, meeting the
brunette's gaze in the mirror.  "You're gorgeous," Brooke continued a second
later.</p>

<p>Sam smiled a wicked, sexy smile and turned around so that she could see
Brooke completely.  "I suppose," she replied in an almost whisper, "that it
takes one to know one," she went on raking her eyes over Brooke, who-she
noticed in a naughty kind of way-was turning a bit red.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me like that," Brooke warned feeling herself begin to react
to the positively lecherous look on Sam's face.  "We're already late."</p>

<p>Sam put up her hands in the universal sign of peace, although she still
looked rather amused and a little bit lecherous.  "I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Is everything set?" Brooke asked before gallantly taking Sam's hand into
hers and kissing it softly.</p>

<p>"The elder," Sam said started smiling over a Brooke, "thinks that I'm off to
the movies with Carm and Lily, and that it's very sweet of you to drop me
off," she continued deciding to omit the part about her mothers almost
dictatorial questions about her plans for the evening.</p>

<p>"Chanel boutique for me," Brooke responded.  "After you my dear," she
continued crossing over to the door and spryly opening it.</p>
