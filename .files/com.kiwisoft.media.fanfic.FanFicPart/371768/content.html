<P><B>capitulo tres. (translation: chapter three) (as if that wasn't obvious) sorry it took so long, but here it is. enjoy.</B></P><P><B>oh, and i noticed that on chapter one i accidentally used Cyrus instead of Stewart. my bad. totally didn't mean to.</B></P><P>The mall is boring and suck-ish. Why anyone invented it is beyond me. I mean, I see the point in putting all the stores together to make it easier to shop, but that's only for people who like to shop. More importantly, people who like to shop in prep stores like American Eagle and Abercrombie. Gag me.</P><P>We decided to go to Hot Topic first (since that's pretty much the only store I'll willingly go to). On our way there, we pass by 3 people who mutter "fag" under their breath, 5 people who shove Oliver in the shoulder, and about 43 people who just gawked. I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, at least none of the hostility is directed at me, the freak girl in all black with a lip ring and combat boots. But on the other hand, I feel bad for Oliver, because I know how it feels when the whole world judges you based on how you look. It doesn't even seem to phase him, though.</P><P>It's extremely easy to spot Hot Topic, even from far away. That store sticks out like a sore thumb, or more accurately, like me; the one raven in a sea of doves. When we walk in we're greeted by a tall guy with a lime green mohawk.</P><P>"Sup," I say to him, nodding my head. Oliver looks slightly frightened, but Lilly just looks apathetic. I, however, probably look like a kid in a candy store.</P><P>"What are we here for, again?" Oliver asks, cringing away from a passing girl with chin-length, layered, hot pink hair.</P><P>"Just to shop. That was the point of today, wasn't it?" I reply, scanning a case in the center of the aisle that contained lip rings.</P><P>"Well, yeah, but do we have to shop <I>here</I>?"</P><P>"Oh, I'm sorry, Oliver, where would you like to go, since this Step-Sister Bonding Day is all about you?"</P><P>He scowls at me then walks away, looking over some rings on the front counter. I look around for Lilly, but can't find her. Oh well. Let her do her thing while I do mine. That's how I like it, anyway. That's how it should be.</P><P>I maneuver my way through the crowd to the hair dye, deciding which color streaks to put in my hair next. Last time, I put purple in, but it's fading into just the bleached blonde again. Dad hates it when I dye my hair unnatural colors, so I grab some more bleach to add even more streaks. I'm trying to choose between the hot pink I saw on a girl earlier or electric blue when Oliver comes up to me.</P><P>"Can we go yet?"</P><P>"We haven't even been in this store for more than 6 minutes. Grow a pair and quit cringing every time someone passes you. There's some pretty cool stuff in here if you'd just look."</P><P>"Sure, yeah, of course, whatever you say." He heads off again and I grab the pink. Don't get me wrong, I kind of hate pink, but I think it'll look cool in my hair.</P><P>I walk over to the jewelry and start scrutinizing two pairs of earrings that look the same. One of them is dangly skulls, and the other one is dangly skulls. Oh, my bad, one of them is a shade darker. I grab the darker shaded ones and walk over to the CDs. I pick up one of Paramore, checking the back to see what songs are on it. In my opinion, it's better to buy the CDs so that you can rip the songs to your iTunes and put them on your iPod while still having the CD to jam out to in your room on your stereo. I like to turn the volume up super loud, because Robby Ray hates that.</P><P>"Miley, can we go <I>now</I>?" Okay, he was alright at first, but now he's starting to bug me.</P><P>"If you don't shut your fucking mouth and stop complaining I'm gonna shove one of these clothes hangers up your ass. Can it." He looks very taken aback, but just turns around slowly and wordlessly and strides away. Maybe I'll apologize later...Nah.</P><P>10 minutes later I finish shopping and try to find Oliver and Lilly before heading to the counter, on the off chance that perhaps they've actually found something they like. I spot Oliver sitting on a bench just outside the store. When I meet his eye, he turns his head away from me. Fine, give me the silent treatment, see if I care. I swivel around and look for Lilly next, since I haven't seen her the full 20 minutes we've been here. Her blonde hair catches my eye and I head towards her. She's standing in front of some center display, eyeing something I can't see because she's blocking my view.</P><P>"Lilly!" I call. She jumps 3 feet in the air as if a ghost called her name, instead of her step-sister.</P><P>"Yeah?" She says breathlessly, tucking her hair behind her ear and turning to face me.</P><P>"I'm done here. Did you find anything?"</P><P>"No, no. You go ahead and check out. I'll just wait outside with Oliver." She scampers off towards the exit leaving me completely bewildered. I look forward at the display she was standing in front of; shelves of gay pride shit. So that's why she jumped? She knows that I know that Oliver's gay, right? So why would I care she was looking at gay pride crap for some kind of birthday present for him? That girl is so weird.</P><P>I check out the hair dye, bleach, earrings, CD, and a container of mints I grabbed at the last minute by the cash register (they're for saving music programs in schools, which I totally support). When I get close to the doorway, I can see Lilly and Oliver having a heated conversation while sitting on the bench. Oliver was waving his arms around animatedly while Lilly sat there and held her hands out to him, palms up, seeming to be pleading for something. He was probably complaining about me and trying to convince her to ditch me. If that was the case, though, why would she be pleading?</P><P>"What'd I miss?" I ask, strolling up to them. Oliver scowls at me, again, then turns away. Lilly looks at me like she's trying really hard to be casual, even though she's the furthest thing from it.</P><P>"Nothing, nothing at all. Right, Oliver?"</P><P>He rounds his head slowly to face me, then fake smiles. "Of course. You missed nothing."</P><P>"Oooo-kaaay. Well if you two weirdos want to get a move on, we can go to your preppy stores now. Where to? Hollister? Aeropostale?"</P><P>Both of them remain silent, not answering my question. They both just stared up at me wordlessly.</P><P>"Okay, you guys are freaks. I'm leaving."</P><P>I start to stalk off when Lilly calls to me. "Miley, wait!"</P><P>A hand on my shoulder spins me around. When I'm facing her I give her a deadly glare and she quickly releases her hand. "I don't know about you, but I'm kinda hungry, you wanna go to the food court?"</P><P>"Are you two still going to act completely insane?"</P><P>"No. You just caught us off-guard. We were in the middle of a conversation."</P><P>"About what?"</P><P>She intentionally ignores my question by looking back at Oliver and saying, "Let's go, we're gonna go eat."</P><P>"Fine." He gets up and shoves past me, walking a good 4 feet ahead of us.</P><P>"What's his problem?" Lilly asks me as we start following.</P><P>"I might've threatened him."</P><P>"Why?"</P><P>"He wouldn't stop complaining like a little 4-year-old girl. I got irked."</P><P>"Oh, okay. Good job."</P><P>"You're approving of my threatening to shove a clothes hanger up his ass?"</P><P>"Eh, he'd probably like it."</P><P>I couldn't help it. I stopped dead in my tracks and stared at her open-mouthed.</P><P>"What?" She asked, stopping at the same time I did and returning my gaze.</P><P>"You're totally bashing your own gay friend."</P><P>"I'm not bashing him. I'm making fun of him. There's a difference. And as his best friend, I'm allowed to make fun of him." She had this look of total justification, so I just let it go.</P><P>"Fine, whatever. Let's just go catch up with him."</P><P>"Okay." We continue walking; Oliver's gotten so far ahead I can barely see him anymore. "You probably should apologize, though."</P><P>"I guess."</P><P>We make it to the food court and manage to make it to Oliver. I apologize and he immediately forgives me. Lilly wanted some french fries but Oliver and I wanted some orange chicken, so she went to McDonald's while he and I went over to stand in line at Panda Express, which is where we are now.</P><P>"So how did you and Lilly meet?"</P><P>"At a GSA meeting at school."</P><P>"What's a GSA?"</P><P>"How do you not know what that is? It's a Gay Straight Alliance, a club for gay people and straight people to come together and work on making things better for both sides."</P><P>"Right. And how would I know that?"</P><P>"Everyone knows that."</P><P>"No one knows that."</P><P>"Like I was saying," he says pointedly, glaring at me for interrupting him, "we met at a GSA meeting. She had some really good ideas on how to bring the gay kids and straight kids at our school together, so she and I went to Starbucks after the meeting to discuss it further."</P><P>"Cool."</P><P>"Yeah, and we've just been best friends ever since."</P><P>"That's pretty cool. What side is she on?"</P><P>"What do you mean?"</P><P>"Is she one of the straight kids or gay kids?"</P><P>Before he had a chance to answer, Lilly sprints over, french fries in hand, and slaps Oliver on the shoulder.</P><P>"What are we talking about?" She asks, smile on her face.</P><P>"Nothing. Absolutely nothing." Oliver replies, smiling back. He turns his gaze back on me, meeting my eyes, and winks at me, almost imperceptibly.</P><P>Lilly doesn't notice. I don't think she's meant to.</P><P><B>yay, chapter 3. review please :)</B></P>
