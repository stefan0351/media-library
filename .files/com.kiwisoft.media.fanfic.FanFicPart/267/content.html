<!-- For the Love of Miss Bard \ Part 1-->

<P>"Come on pumpkin, time to get up" Alexandria
  called to her five-year-old daughter Sam. "Today's the first day of Kindergarten."
  </P>
<P>Samantha stirred under the covers. She was awake,
  but she wanted to pretend she was still sleeping.</P>
<P>"Sammy, I'm gonna getcha." Alex jumped on the
  bed and started tickling the love of her life.</P>
<P>Today was not the official first day. It was
  more of a teacher gets to know the children and parents day. It only lasted
  for two hours rather than the usual four. Kathryn Bard was preparing the classroom
  for the morning session. This would be her first year teaching at Lincoln elementary.
  She taught K-classes back in Vancouver, Washington but decided to move to California
  after her mother past away last year. Her father had his business in Los Angeles
  and Kathryn wanted to be near him. She found a really nice house just outside
  of LA It was walking distance from the school. This was great because Kathryn
  did not like driving, especially in such a crowded city where traffic was always
  jam-packed.</P>
<P>The first bell rang at 7:45, letting the teachers
  know that class would begin soon. Kathryn hurried to the front door of room
  21. She wanted to make sure she greeted every student. Kindergarten was always
  the hardest in the beginning. There were lots of tears from both children and
  parents. </P>
<P>One by one the children entered the classroom
  holding tight to either mommy or daddy. Kathryn introduced herself to the little
  ones and their parents. </P>
<P>"Hi what's your name" Kathryn asked as she kneeled
  down to meet a little red-haired girl.</P>
<P>The little girl smiled and stuck out her hand
  "Tracy." </P>
<P>"Nice to meet you Tracy" Kathryn shook her hand.
  Tracy was accompanied by her father. Kathryn stood up and shook his hand. "Hi"
  she greeted. </P>
<P>"Well, hello there, I'm Frank," he said as he
  held her hand. His eyes focused directly on her breasts which were covered by
  a white knitted sweater. </P>
<P>Kathryn felt his gaze which she didn't appreciate.
  Oh great, not another&#133; OK, think good thoughts. Kathryn gave as phony a
  smile as she could jester hoping Frank would get the point that she is not interested,
  especially in a parent. It wasn't unusual for the teacher crush thing, as long
  as that's all it was. Kathryn was good at handling these types of parents. </P>
<P>She was kneeling down talking to a little boy
  named Jason. He was crying and refused to go in. His mother was pleading with
  him that school would be fun. </P>
<P>"Noooo, I don't wanttttooogooo." He yelled.
  </P>
<P>"What if mommy sat with you Jason."</P>
<P>"You could look at all the fun things in the
  class" Kathryn suggested. </P>
<P>"I don't wannna go to school" Jason stomped
  his feet. </P>
<P>"There's punch and cookies," his mother added
  in hopes he would go in. Jason decided he was hungry and grabbed his mommy's
  hand. They walked into the classroom.</P>
<P>Kathryn took a deep breath and before she could
  stand up again, a little auburn-haired girl greeted her.</P>
<P>"Hello" the little girl said with a great big
  smile on her face. "Are you my teacher?"</P>
<P>"Well, lets check, what's your name" Kathryn
  asked looking at her roster. </P>
<P>"I'n Sam."</P>
<P>"OK Sam, what's your last name" Sam turned around
  to look at mommy. Kathryn looked up, way up to see a very tall, very attractive
  woman standing behind Sam. Wow she's beautiful. Kathryn thought as she stood
  up. </P>
<P>"It's Trout, like the fish" Alex said with a
  grin. She's really cute oh are we gonna have fun in Kindergarten. Alex thought
  as returned the gaze. "I'm Alex."</P>
<P>Kathryn stared into those deep blue eyes and
  for a brief instant felt a connection.</P>
<P>She momentarily lost her train of thought. "Sorry,
  I'm Kathryn, Kathryn Bard" she said with a shake of her head. "Well, shall we
  go inside" Kathryn said as she lead the last two people into her class. I wonder
  if there is a Mr. Trout? Don't go there K. you know better. Kathryn caught herself
  gazing again at Alex. OK, focus.</P>
<P>"Good morning class" She announced. The children
  repeated the teacher. Kathryn explained some of what she expected from the children.
  She also clarified what she expected from the parents; knowing there would be
  a few who disregarded what she said. Overall the meeting went well. </P>
<P>There was a sign up sheet for volunteer parents
  Kathryn passed around. She was hoping that Sam's mom would sign up. She watched
  the pair as they walked around the classroom. Sam was so excited. She wanted
  to see every detail of the room. Her mommy followed along and looked just as
  thrilled. Kathryn finished answering questions a few of the parents had. She
  walked over to Sam and her mommy.</P>
<P>"How do you like the classroom?" She asked.
  </P>
<P>"It is sooo bootiful" Sam responded.</P>
<P>"So is mommy going to volunteer with the class?"
  Kathryn asked while Sam looked up at her mommy in anticipation.</P>
<P>"Well, I can probably come in for a little while
  on Wednesdays" Alex suggested.</P>
<P>"Great." Kathryn smiled and handed Alex the
  sign up sheet. </P>
<P>"Well, let's get going" Alex said to Sam. She
  put her hand out to Kathryn and said good-bye. We'll see you tomorrow Mrs. Bard"
  Alex stressed the word "Mrs."</P>
<P>"It's Miss" Kathryn said.</P>
<P>Alex cocked her eyebrow. "Miss Bard" she said
  slowly. </P>
<P>Kathryn found her self smiling again.</P>
<P>"So what do you think of your teacher?" Alex
  asked Sam as they drove home. </P>
<P>"She's nice," Sam said. Within a matter of minutes
  they were home. Alex helped Sam out of the car and they walked inside. </P>
<P>Before Alex could even put the keys down on
  the table, the phone rang. </P>
<P>"Hi honey, how was Sam's first day?" Cyrene,
  Alex's mom spoke on the other end of the line.</P>
<P>"It went fine mom, she really likes her teacher.
  Are you coming over later?" </P>
<P>"Yes, dear, don't I come over every other day
  so you can go run" Cyrene replied with a bit of sarcasm. "What do you want for
  dinner?" She asked Alex, knowing her daughter really didn't care what she made.
  </P>
<P>"I don't care" Alex said flatly. "What ever's
  easiest for you mom. See you in a while." Cyrene spent a lot of time at Alex's
  house, not that she and Alex got a long greatly, but she loved her little granddaughter
  Sam. Ever since Sam was born, she and Alex started spending a lot more time
  together, which drove Alex crazy, but she needed her mom to help her out. </P>
<P>Kathryn was just finishing up in the classroom
  when her friend Christie came in. She teaches third grade.</P>
<P>"Hey are you ready to go?" Christie asked. The
  duo was going out for an early dinner. Kathryn got to know Christie during the
  summer while the teachers were attending seminars and workshops.</P>
<P>"All finished, let's go, I'm starving" Kathryn
  replied. The two women headed out the door towards the parking lot.</P>
<P>"So did you meet all your students?" Christie
  asked. </P>
<P>"Yea, they were great." Kathryn said with a
  smile "Parents were OK, I gave them my usual what I expect from them speech,
  I doubt if anyone really listened. But they were nice" especially Sam's mom
  Kathryn thought to her self. She was really nice. They drove to a little Mexican
  restaurant. They spent the next hour talking about lesson plans and school activities.
  </P>
<P>Alex and Sam had lunch and played for a while
  in the back yard, then they colored and watched "Nick in the afternoon" until
  grandma showed up. They all helped get dinner ready. Alex made a salad while
  Cyrene cooked some chicken and steamed some vegetables. Sam was given the task
  of tearing the lettuce and putting it into the salad bowl.</P>
<P>"So are you going to do any work tonight?" Cyrene
  asked Alex. </P>
<P>"Maybe later when Sam's asleep. I need to finish
  up some reports, and check up on one on my employees." Alex owned a company
  that prepared medical records for various hospitals and clinics. She had people
  working as medical transcriptionists and others that did medical billings. Her
  office in the back room of her house. She worked usually late at night while
  Sam was sleeping. Now that Sam will be going to school, she'll be able to work
  in the mornings.</P>
<P>It would be about another hour and a half before
  the sun went down. Alex went upstairs to change into her running clothes and
  shoes. Her mother finished making dinner and started cleaning the already cleaned
  house. </P>
<P>"Mother, why don't you just relax and watch
  some television?" Alex said as she came down stairs.</P>
<P>"You know this helps me relax Alex, go do your
  running, I'll be fine." Alex headed out to the front yard. She stretched her
  legs up against the wall that divided her yard from the neighbors. Then she
  headed out in a slow jog. </P>
<P>Kathryn and Christie had finished eating. They
  decided to go to Kathryn's house and watch a movie. On the drive back Kathryn
  saw a woman running. She was on the other side of the street which didn't give
  Kathryn a good view. As they past her, Kathryn felt her heartbeats quicken.
  She could see it was Alexandria. She turned her head as far as she could until
  Christie was blocking her view.</P>
<P>"You know her?" Christie asked.</P>
<P>"I think that's Sam's mom, I met her today"
  Kathryn replied. </P>
<P>"She's really attractive," Christie added. Kathryn
  just blushed and turned her head toward her window. Christie caught the blush
  though. </P>
<P>Christie pulled into the driveway. Kathryn kept
  looking back to see if Alex was running toward them. She was hesitating to get
  out of the car. She fumbled for her keys and after about a minute, she found
  them and got out of the car. The mail got to get the mail she thought. "I'm
  going to get the mail, here go ahead inside." Kathryn said as she tossed the
  keys to Christie. </P>
<P>As Kathryn walked to the mailbox by the curb,
  she saw Alex coming down the street oblivious to everything except what was
  directly in front of her. </P>
<P>Suddenly she saw a short blond woman standing
  by the street. As her eyes moved up from the legs to her breast and then finally
  to her face, she was caught by surprise as the woman waved to her. </P>
<P>"Hi" Kathryn called out.</P>
<P>It took Alex a moment to respond as she came
  to a sudden stop. "Miss Bard! What a surprise." Alex finally spoke.</P>
<P>"Yes, it is a surprise, you live around here?"
  Da, her daughter wouldn't go to my school if she didn't. Kathryn felt like kicking
  herself. </P>
<P>"Yea, just up the street, you live here?" Alex
  asked in between breaths. </P>
<P>"Yea, how far do you run?"</P>
<P>"I go to the high school and do three miles
  on the track, then I run back coming this way" Alex replied.</P>
<P>Kathryn's eyes wandered down toward Alex's legs,
  she felt a charge of electricity run through her as she thought of how strong
  and soft those legs would feel if she had the chance to... She looked up to
  see Alex starring at her chest. She brought her hand up above her breast and
  fingered the button on her sweater.</P>
<P>"Hey you coming in" Both women were brought
  out of their brief fantasies by Christie who yelled out the front door. Kathryn
  felt a blush run over her face.</P>
<P>Alex looked at Kathryn and then toward the door
  to Christie. I wonder if that's her roommate. Or maybe something else. Alex
  thought. She your roommate? Alex couldn't help but ask.</P>
<P>"My roommate, no, she's Miss Smith, I mean Christie,
  she teaches first, I mean... um third grade, we just came back from dinner and
  were going to watch a movie." Kathryn found herself explaining as if she owed
  it to Alex. "No, I live alone." She finally added.</P>
<P>"Oh," she lives alone Alex found herself smiling.
  </P>
<P>"I'd better let you finish your run" Kathryn
  said hesitating. </P>
<P>"Yea, I'll see you tomorrow" Alex replied. They
  stared at each other not wanting to break away.</P>
<P>Christie called out again this time telling
  Kathryn she was wanted on the phone. This broke the spell that the two had been
  under. </P>
<P>Alex started her jog and Kathryn turned to walk
  away. Alex looked back to see Kathryn walking toward the house. I wish my teacher
  looked that good when I was in school.</P>
<P>Just as she turned and ran on, Kathryn turned
  to look at Alex running away. R emember K, she's a parent.</P>
<P>Kathryn walked into the house. She was feeling
  really good. She picked up the phone; "hello" her father was on the other end.
  </P>
<P>"Hi honey, how was school."</P>
<P>"It was fine dad, how was your day?"</P>
<P>"Oh just the same as every other day, I had
  to fire one of my workers though, caught him stealing."</P>
<P>"Oh no, are you OK, did it get nasty?" Kathryn
  asked with concern. </P>
<P>"Nah, I'm fine. He was a good worker."</P>
<P>"I'm sorry to hear that dad."</P>
<P>"Well, don't let me bother you with my work,
  are we still on for Friday," he asked.</P>
<P>"Yea, I'll see you at your place, I love you
  dad" Kathryn said then hung up the phone.</P>
<P>"Was that one of your new parents outside?"
  Christie asked </P>
<P>"Oh, yea, she's Samantha Trout's mom" Kathryn
  said. </P>
<P>American Movie Classics was just starting the
  movie Lion in the Winter with Katharine Hepburn.</P>
<P>"Oh I love her." Kathryn stated with joy. </P>
<P>"Well, come on then let's watch the movie."
  Christie said as she grabbed Kathryn and pulled her to the couch.</P>

<hr>

<P>"Honey do you want to walk to school or should
  we take the car?" Alex asked Sam as she finished the last of her breakfast.
  </P>
<P>"I want to walk to school." Sam said.</P>
<P>The pair headed out toward the school. It was
  a couple of blocks from their home. Alex walked Sam into the classroom. She
  smiled when she saw Miss Bard. "Honey say good morning to your teacher." </P>
<P>"Good mowning" Sam said.</P>
<P>"Good morning to you Sam, why don't you go sit
  on the carpet next to the other students." Kathryn suggested, then she turned
  to look at Alex "Hi." </P>
<P>Alex waved her hand. She bent down and gave
  Sam a kiss. "Your gonna be OK honey." Her stomach was doing flip-flops. </P>
<P>Kathryn must have noticed the nervousness in
  Alex. She put her hand on Alex's forearm. "She'll be all right." Then she gave
  a warm, genuine smile. </P>
<P>"I know, it's just she's never been without
  me or my mom before." Alex said with concern.</P>
<P>"You can stay for a while if you'd like." Only
  her or her mom, what about the dad? Kathryn wondered.</P>
<P>"No, I'm sure she'll be fine" Alex said although
  her worried expression showed through. I'm acting like a baby</P>
<P>"OK, we'll see you at twelve." Kathryn said
  with a smile. </P>
<P>On the walk back home, Alex thought about how
  comfortable Miss Bard made her feel. She sure is nice. Nice, come on she's cute
  and her body hmm. Alex found a smile on her face as she went over the brief
  conversation they had yesterday. She lives alone, nice house... Alone. Alex
  hadn't realized she picked up a bit of a jog. She was home within minutes. </P>
<P>"OK class we are going to each have a special
  place to work. These are called our work stations." Miss Bard announced to the
  children as she walked around the room showing them the tables and chairs where
  the work stations were going to be. "We are going to learn the very beginning
  on how to ask questions by raising our hands" she raised her hand and all the
  children imitated her action by raising their hands. </P>
<P>Miss Bard and the students spent the day getting
  to know each other. There were some outbursts of tears, but that was to be expected.
  She handled the students well, by telling them stories and singing songs. "Let's
  sing a song about some animals OK." </P>
<P>The students were all happy to listen as Miss
  Bard sang "Giraffe are tall, with necks so long. Elephants' trunks are big and
  strong. Zebras have stripes and can gallop away, While monkeys in the trees
  do sway. Old crocodile swims in a pool so deep, Or lies in the sun and goes
  to sleep." </P>
<P>The next thing she taught the children was to
  form a line. It wasn't very easy. Some of the students that had been to preschool
  were able to keep straight in line while others were not sure of what they were
  doing. Therefore, they tried to follow along.</P>
<P>"OK, were are going to play a game called choo
  choo train. I want everyone to try and stay in line and follow me as we walk
  all around the class room." Miss Bard walked along checking behind her to see
  that most of the students were able to follow along.</P>
<P>Alex spent the morning in her office going over
  some reports before sending them to the medical offices. Before she knew it,
  it was time to pick up Sam. She decided they would go to lunch at McDonalds
  after school. They hadn't gone there for a while so she figured it would be
  OK. </P>
<P>It was about ten minutes before the kindergarten
  classes would let out. Alex waited outside the fenced area with all the other
  parents. She stood off to the side where it was easy for her to see the classroom
  door. </P>
<P>Miss Bard opened the door and led the children
  out to the fence. She checked them out to the parents one by one.</P>
<P>Alex waited until she could see Sam. "There's
  my girl." </P>
<P>"Mommy." Sam screamed with delight.</P>
<P>Miss Bard saw Alex as she first opened the door
  and a smile immediately covered her face.</P>
<P>"Hi" she mouthed the words in Alex's direction.
  </P>
<P>Alex smiled and raised her eyebrows.</P>
<P>Sam jumped up into her mommy's arms and planted
  a kiss on her face. </P>
<P>Alex returned the affectionate hugs and kisses.
  </P>
<P>"We had so much fun today mommy." Sam enthusiastically
  stated. "We sang songs and played games."</P>
<P>Miss Bard looked on and could feel Sam's excitement.
  "I'm glad you had a good day Sam, it only gets better." She said as she looked
  from Sam to Alex. </P>
<P>"Well, lets go get some lunch OK." Alex said
  as she put Sam down on the floor. </P>
<P>"Yea!" Sam screamed.</P>
<P>"So did your day go OK?" Alex asked Miss Bard
  </P>
<P>"Yea, just got to get back into the swing of
  things. We'll be starting the volunteers next week, so I can look forward to
  seening you next Wednesday? </P>
<P>"Oh, yea, what time do you want me?" Alex replied
  with a hint of flirtation. G od did I just say that. She looked up to see Miss
  Bard grinning back at her. </P>
<P>"Well, I'd like to have you&#133; around ten."
  Two can play at this. She replied with just as much flirtation.</P>
<P>"Come on mommy let's go eat." Sam interrupted.
  </P>
<P>"OK, Hon, tell Miss Bard you'll see her tomorrow."
  </P>
<P>"See you toomawo Miss Bard."</P>
<P>"See ya later alligator."</P>
<P>Sam laughed at the comment.</P>
<P>The pair turned to walk away. Miss Bard stood
  at the gate and waved her fingers.</P>

<hr>

<P>It just so happened that around the same time
  Kathryn had seen Alex running by her house yesterday, she decided to go out
  and water the lawn. She stayed out side for a while, but Alex never ran by.
  </P>
<P>Alex was home playing dress up Barbie with Sam.
  Actually, Sam was dressing Barbie. Alex was playing with her Xena doll. </P>
<P>"OK Warrior Princess you have to rescue Barbie
  from the terrible Ken-man who wants to take away her pony" Alex said with a
  deep voice. </P>
<P>"Tch, mommy, Xena always beats up Ken." Sam
  complained. </P>
<P>"Well, Ken needs to find his own pony."</P>
<P>"Oh no, what did you do to Gabrielle?" Alex
  asked as she pulled the Gabrielle doll out of the box Sam had her dolls in.
  </P>
<P>"Grandma cut her hair for me." Sam said with
  a smile. </P>
<P>"Oh grandma did huh? Alex smirked. Lucky for
  you mom I have another one put away.</P>
<P>"Hey doesn't Gabrielle look like Miss Bard"
  Sam laughed out. </P>
<P>"Let me see. Yea I guess she does." Alex said
  as she examined the doll closely.</P>
<P>"Oh save me from this terrible Ken-man" Alex
  called in a high pitched voice as she held Gabrielle/Miss Bard up. "I'll save
  you Miss Bard." The Xena doll replied. Wham, Bam, flip, Swish, the sword came
  out and pelted Ken right in the gut.</P>
<P>"Xena, my hero," the Miss Bard doll said as
  she leaned in and kissed the Xena doll.</P>
<P>"Oh Miss Bard!" the Xena doll replied.</P>
<P>"Your funny mommy." Sam giggled.</P>
<P>"Yea, funny lookin,' come on its time for someone
  to get ready for bed." </P>
<P>"Awe do I have to."</P>
<P>"School tomorrow, remember." Alex said as she
  got up and started to get Sam ready for bed.</P>
