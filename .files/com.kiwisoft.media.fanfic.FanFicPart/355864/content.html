<p>Seven walked into Sickbay shortly after the Doctor and watched as he bustled about, preparing the surgical bay. 78.132 seconds later, she reconsidered the surgery. She had been weighing the pros and cons, professional versus personal life and she flashed back on everything she had experienced in the past few days, her nightmare resurfacing.</p>
		<p>"I didn't know you had a personal life."</p>
		<p>"Was that Seven of Nine?"</p>
		<p>"If this is interfering with your duty..." 'Duty.' The word lodged itself in Seven's mind. The lies she had told, the fact that people believed them because it was easier to see her as a workaholic than as a person. Even Kathryn Janeway, who had encouraged her since the day she set foot on Voyager, had chastised her for developing her individuality. Even if she hadn't know that that was what she was chastising her for.</p>
		<p>"Voyager was almost destroyed..." 'because of me. Because I cannot balance a personality and my Duty.' All this passed through her head in 78.132 seconds.</p>
		<p>"All right, Seven, I think I'm ready to begin," the Doctor said, approaching her with a smile on his face.</p>
		<p>"I regret that I am not."</p>
		<p>"What? Seven--"</p>
		<p>"I am sorry." With that, Seven hurried out of Sickbay. She finally arrived in Astrometrics and went to work, trying to block everything running through her mind.</p>
		<p>'She's a Coward.' 'No, she's just Borg. A Machine. Machines don't feel.' 'She feels. That is her problem.' 'No, that is her weakness.' Seven opened her eyes. She was laying on the cargo bay floor, curled up in a ball. At some point during her regeneration cycle, she had fallen asleep--literally. Rubbing the bruise on her elbow, she sat up, trying to chase the ghost voices from her dream away.</p>
		<p>Coward...</p>
		<p>Machine...</p>
		<p>The voices wouldn't leave her alone. They screamed at her, tearing her apart, deconstructing her every action and thought. And every single one was her own voice.</p>
