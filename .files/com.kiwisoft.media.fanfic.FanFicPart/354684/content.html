<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 15 -->

<p>Buffy Summers felt strong hands massaging her shoulders. "You
know, while I'm glad to be one of the Scoobies again. I am now glad
you were the first called." Buffy smirked at Faith over her shoulder.
"Why is that?" Faith smirked. "All I have to do is break things. No
weighty decisions or stuff like that. Well break things, and give our
beloved slayer back rubs. Which reminds me, aren't you supposed to the
be one giving me a back rub?" Buffy laughed. "I'll owe ya two. Faith?
Do you think Spike is right? Do you think Riley isn't going to turn
Giles and Tara?" Faith's face mirrored the sad look on Buffy's face as
she rested her hands on the blonde's neck. "I don't know. I want to
think that, and Spike did make sense. I mean Riley probably would have
sent them against us already if he did, and the fact that after Spike
turned him we would be expecting it. So they would be more valuable
alive as hostages."</p>

<p>Buffy turned around and nuzzled into Faith's arms, silently
seeking comfort that Faith willingly gave. While she didn't turn
around she did raise and turn her head as Xander and Anya came back in
the room. "How's Willow?" Xander shook his head. "Terrified, but
sleeping. Buffy we got to get them back." Buffy then turned around in
Faith's arms. "We will. Spike already volunteered to go scouting."
Xander's expression looked dubious. "You really think we can trust
him?" Buffy nodded. "He hates Riley about as much as Angel hates him."
Xander smirked. "A virtual tradition. Reminds me of my family. Except
with out the biting, snarling demon thing… well with out the demon
part." They all grinned slightly as Buffy closed and then reopened her
eyes while Faith massaged her scalp. "We'll need to fool the cops
though. Anya sighed. "I'll stay here and say you guys went to sleep if
anything happens."</p>

<p>Xander smiled and gave Anya a kiss, which left the girl
looking both happy and surprised while he started speaking. "Think we
will be able to sneak past them?" Anya then spoke again. "I'll make a
big issue about going to bed so their attention will be here." This
time she was surprised, but happy as they all smiled at her, Buffy
then speaking. "Thanks Anya. Ok, we will wait an hour for Spike to get
back. Then either way we sneak out. Let's get ready." Xander got up
and started walking towards the make shift armory he had set up. All
three girls looked skeptical and he noticed and grinned. "Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing." Something that didn't seem to comfort them at
all. If anything it had the opposite effect. </p>

<p>He emerged about ten minutes later while Buffy and Faith were
picking out various hand to hand weapons. He carried several bundles
to the coffee table, a ugly looking little machine gun with a dozen of
it's curved clips, a handgun with 8 clips, an assortment of mundane
things like a small flash light, a miniature first aid kit, and
similar items. It was when he took out a gleaming combat knife Faith's
eyes shot up. "Ohhhhhhhhh, shiny. Got any more?" Xander shook his
head. "Sorry, just grabbed one guys worth." Faith seemed to be pouting
as Buffy walked over to examine Xander's personal arsenal. "You mean
all that is just for one guy?" Xander nodded. "It may seem a lot, but
not everyone was blessed with superpowers. Hopefully this will help
even the playing field a bit."</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith both seemed dubious at his words and were
ready to speak, but he beat them to it. "I know, I know, just don't
shoot you guys." Both girls grinned at him, and then found themselves
slightly startled at the cool expression on his face as he started
taking the guns apart, cleaning them, oiling them, and putting them
back together. They had sat down to go through a far more antiquated
weapon assortment. By the time that the hour was up Spike had yet to
return and they were done with waiting. Faith had selected an
assortment of knives for her personal weapons and had secreted them on
her person. Buffy had selected a Roman short sword, she thought Giles
had called it a gladius, but all that mattered to her was that it was
both long enough to inflict sufficient damage, yet short enough to be
swung quickly and easily, and concealed under a light coat. Both girls
had also taken an assortment of wooden stakes, as had Xander. His
personal weaponry was far more diverse however, the collection held to
his chest with a black nylon rig.</p>

<p>Xander had also concealed his gear under a windbreaker, which
then left the trio looking like little more then three young people
out for a walk. Or at least they hoped as much when Xander kissed Anya
goodbye and moved to the side of the house farthest from where the
cops were currently positioned. As the sounds of Anya getting ready
for bed drifted down to them they all allowed a grin as Faith then
opened the window and slid out. Following right behind her Buffy
touched down on the grass, and then Xander, though with a thud
compared to the whispering movements of the slayers. Once he was on
the ground however he was able to keep quiet and the path that the two
slayers led him along was free of the various debris that could give
them away.</p>

<p>Once they had gotten a block away from the house they had
walked onto the street and except for keeping an eye out for patrol
cars they were able to move freely. Xander looked at the girls. "Ok,
were out. Now what?" Buffy looked between the two of them as Faith
also looked at Buffy for direction. "All right, all we have right now
is old haunts. We probably shouldn't swing by his dorm since it's a
crime scene. So lets find the access door Spike used to lead us into
the Initiative when we rescued Oz. The other two seemed to nod; though
Faith looked like she was simply willing to follow their lead. Which
Buffy proceeded to do as She stepped to the front and started walking.
When they had reached the wooded area they knew they had hit the
jackpot because they had seen several military trucks. Of course it
might not be the jackpot they had been looking for so they started
creeping forward to examine the trucks closer.</p>

<p>That was interrupted as hand grabbed Buffy and pulled her back
to the shadows. Hands that quickly fell away as Faith slid in the
space between the two figures and slammed her palm into the other
figure's chin hard enough to shatter teeth as the jaw slammed upward.
At least it would have if the person were mortal. Spike was glaring at
all of them as he held his hand to his jaw, but the three took the
hint and slipped into shadows. As they did Xander holstered the Colt
45 handgun he had drawn. Spike was testing his jaw and still glaring
at the dark slayer as he started to whisper. "Couldn't wait could ya?
Fine! He's in there, been using some of the bigger demons as
excavation gear. Apparently the Initiative had emptied the place out
and then filled it in with concrete."</p>

<p>Buffy chewed her bottom lip. "Ok, we don't need a replay of
last year. So we need to stop him now." They all nodded as they
continued. "Any indicator of how many in there?" Spike shook his head.
"I only see smaller demons coming out and loading concrete into one of
the trucks they emptied out." "Ok, so two of the trucks are still
filled with equipment?" Xander spoke up then. "I knew we would be
dealing with trucks. So I have charges that could destroy them if I
rig it between the fuel tank and cargo area." They all looked at him
as Faith spoke. "Why between?" Xander started at her. "I don't care
about the front of the truck, I want to make sure I blow up the
equipment in the back, putting the charge there will ignite the tank
while still concentrating on the cargo area."</p>

<p>They all nodded appreciatively at that as Buffy then spoke.
"Ok Xander, you go set the charges and Spike you cover him." The
vampire seemed ready to object but looked at the faces of those
assembled and nodded. "Xander, can you set them up to explode about
five minutes after we enter?" He nodded. "I'll set the timers for
eight minutes and Spike and I will meet you two after they are set."
Buffy nodded. "Ok we go in from there. If we see any stragglers we
kill them, then move in and find Riley." While in the planning stage
Buffy didn't seem to realize what they would do with Riley once they
found him, and while Xander and Spike didn't realize it Faith did, and
she made a note to herself to keep an eye on the smaller slayer.
Quietly Spike and Xander slipped from where they were hiding and moved
towards where the two trucks were parked. The third truck was missing,
but Spike had told them it was just off dumping concrete.</p>

<p>They were all unsure about trusting the vampire, but the
situation as it was left them needing his help. Faith still had a
stake with his name on it, but kept it tucked away. When the two had
gotten almost all the way to the trucks the two slayers slipped out
themselves and made their way above the entrance. It was somewhat set
into the ground so they were able to get an elevated spot above the
entryway. They hoped that the fact the truck was away would keep the
demons from discovering them early, but Buffy had drawn her short
sword and Faith had a knife in hand. When the men arrived from their
mission of destruction Spike looked almost nonchalant while Xander
seemed the exact opposite as he had a Heckler and Koch submachine gun
to his shoulder with the folding stock extended, but his finger
outside the guard. They both seemed to be looking around for the
slayers and as the two dropped down in front of them Spike jumped into
a defensive position while Xander slipped his finger inside the
trigger guard and on the trigger.</p>

<p>Both men quickly relaxed as they recognized the slayers and
then all four fell silent as Spike stepped forward and opened the
doorway. Buffy and Faith moved up to take the lead, but Xander stopped
them. They first looked at him quizzically but he silently took out
his handgun and handed it to spike with a questioning expression. The
vampire seemed to consider and then nodded as he took the weapon
handed him. Xander then motioned him to one side of the hallway while
he took the other. He then made hand gestures to the two slayers that
seemed to say he and Spike would shoot, then stop, then they would
charge forward. The girls and Spike nodded as they all waited. Three
minutes later the exploding trucks seemed to send out a rush of air
that made their ears pop even as they heard the muffled rumble.</p>

<p>The demons seemed to hear it too as they came down the
hallway. "Fire!" Xander opened up with short bursts that he moved from
left to right as he cut down demon after demon. Spike was on the right
and moved to the left with single shots that seemed to take down their
targets with alarming precision. As the two men stopped firing the
slayers ran forward and were able to easily finish the few demons that
had survived the lethal strafing. Spike twirled the gun in his hand
and handed it handle first to Xander. At the questioning look he
smirked. "I prefer my hands, but in the old west that just meant I got
shot a lot." Xander smiled and nodded as he reloaded both weapons and
put the pistol back in it's holster. The submachine gun was back to
his shoulder and tracking as they all began moving out again. Though
this time they all seemed more comfortable with Xander's being armed.</p>

<p>They stopped when they made it to the main bay where demons
were inspected, dissected and experimented on. While the majority of
the room was hidden behind a jagged wall of concrete the sheer mass of
progress Riley had made in just under a day had amazed all of them.
Xander was the first to put it to wards however. "At this rate he
could have this place unearthed in a week." It was then both the
slayers and the vampire heard a sound that they had heard only moments
ago a Xander had reloaded his submachine gun, the sound of a bolt
being slid back. Buffy was the one to shout it out. "Get down!" The
warning was nearly lost in the clatter of automatic weapons fire.</p>
