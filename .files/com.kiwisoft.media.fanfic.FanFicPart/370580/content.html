<P>"Hi there, Stewart."  Kitty, with an extravagant smile, inserted herself between Miley and Lilly at the breakfast table the next morning. "How goes it with you?"</P><P>Miley raised expressionless eyes to the Cabin 3 counselor, then turned back to her breakfast.</P><P>"Say," began Kitty, undaunted, as if a brilliant idea had suddenly occurred to her, "I'm making up an Algonkian Island all-star baseball team. In a couple of days the Spruce Valley team is coming here to play us. How would you like to be our pitcher?"</P><P>Miley began methodically peeling an orange. "I don't play baseball," she said quietly.</P><P>"Sure you do," cried Kitty. "You're great at baseball!"</P><P>"I don't play it," said Miley, even more quietly.</P><P>"All she plays is chess!" sneered Ashley.</P><P>"Shut up, Ashley!" came from Trina at the head of the table.</P><P>Kitty's face brightened. "Chess, eh? I'm a pretty fair chess player myself. I'll make you a deal. Meet me at four this afternoon, in my room in Cabin 3. We'll have a game of chess. If I win, you play on my baseball team."</P><P>Miley cocked her head, interested. "And if <I>I</I> win?"</P><P>"Well," said Kitty, "name it."</P><P>"I want to go home," said Miley.</P><P>"Stewart!" exclaimed Trina warningly.</P><P>"All right," said Miley, "if I can't go home, then send <I>her</I> home." She pointed to Ashley.</P><P>"Nobody's going home," said Trina. "Ask for something realistic."</P><P>"How about making me camp director for a day?" suggested Miley.</P><P>Kitty walked over to Trina and whispered, "What do you say?"</P><P>"Are you crazy?" exploded Trina. "You can't make Stewart camp director for five minutes! She'll sink the island!"</P><P>"Oh, don't be silly!" whispered Kitty. "Schools these days are always coming out with 'principal for a day' contests, and small towns let kids play 'mayor for a day.' It's only a game. It won't mean anything. And Ms. Warden will be gone all day tomorrow. She doesn't even have to know about it."</P><P>"But I know Stewart!" Trina insisted hoarsely. "Her first official act will be to send herself home!"</P><P>"We'll stipulate that nobody's allowed to go home," argued Kitty. "Besides, there's no way she can beat me at chess! I'm a class A player with an eighteen hundred rating! And what about my baseball team? Spruce valley were last year's champions. They'll murder us if I don't have Stewart. Come on, Trina. I'll clear it with Marina."</P><P>Trina sighed. "If Marina gives permission, then it's okay with me."</P><P>Kitty rushed across the mess hall and began whispering excitedly to the head counselor.</P><P>After a heated discussion, Marina approached table 13. "All right, Stewart," she said, "the deal's on. <I>But</I>—if you win, your term of office lasts only for tomorrow, after Ms. Warden leaves for the mainland. During that time you can't send yourself or anybody else home. And you're not allowed to damage camp property. No trenches, no fires, no bombs. Understood?"</P><P>"Agreed," said Miley.</P><P>"Good!" said Kitty.  "Four o'clock." She was jubilant.</P><P>Marina pulled Kitty aside. "If you lose…" she intoned warningly.</P><P>Trina marched up to the door of the arts and crafts building and ushered Miley and Lilly inside. "Here they are, Chantel," she said meaningfully.  "They'll be here until lunch. Bring them to the mess hall at noon." She leaned over to Chantel and whispered, "And don't let them out of your sight for one second until then!"</P><P>Chantel grinned.  "Don't worry," she promised. "They'll get busy on a project and it'll be noon before you know it. I hope."</P><P>Trina turned to Miley.  "I'll see you and Truscott at lunch." She jogged off towards the soccer field.</P><P>"Well," said Chantel genially, "what have you got planned for today? Another <I>salet</I><I>é</I><I>?</I>"</P><P>"I don't think so," said Miley. "Our last one wasn't really appreciated."</P><P>"Why don't you do some more woodworking?" suggested Chantel. "You could make nice tie racks for your dads."</P><P>Lilly's face darkened, but Miley shrugged affably. "Sounds okay. Would you please go and get us the materials?"</P><P>Chantel started off in the direction of the equipment storage room, then stopped short and chuckled inwardly. "Come along with me," she invited amiably.</P><P>"Oh, no thanks," said Miley. "We'll wait here."</P><P>"Oh, I insist," said Chantel firmly. She was no longer smiling.</P><P>Miley and Lilly exchanged a knowing glance and meekly went along with Chantel to the materials room. Each selected some wood and a design sheet and sat down at the drawing table to plan her project. Keeping one watchful eye on Miley and Lilly, Chantel walked over to help some other girls who were doing leather work.</P><P>"I feel like a prisoner," whispered Lilly angrily. "It looks like the clones are on us to stay. Trina delivers us here; Chantel has to escort us back to the mess hall. We aren't going to be allowed to go anywhere without some clone on our necks!"</P><P>"Well, that's to be expected." Miley shrugged, sketching a design for her tie rack.  "After all, we did try to escape several times yesterday. And this <I>is</I> Camp Algonkian Island—"</P><P>"Yes, yes, I know," interrupted Lilly sourly. "Elias wouldn't have liked people escaping. But Miley, don't you see we're worse off than we were before? We won't be able to breathe without a clone around to supervise it!"</P><P>Miley's eyes gleamed.  "But clones are human—in a vague sort of way. And when Chantel goes to the wash station or something, she won't be able to take us with her. That's when we make our move."</P><P>"What move?" asked Lilly suspiciously.</P><P>"Our move to get off this miserable rock," replied Miley. "I don't know about you, but I'm still planning to go home."</P><P>"What about your chess game with Kitty?"</P><P>Miley shrugged indifferently. "Kitty will get over her disappointment. Life goes on. I'm going to be long gone by four o'clock."</P><P>"Wishful thinking," said Lilly. "We'd still have to take a boat, and that's impossible. We promised not to, and there's no getting around it this time."</P><P>"On the contrary," said Miley. "Somewhere at the other side of this island there's a boat—our sailboat. We wouldn't be taking it—it's already been taken."</P><P>Lilly held her head.  "How do you know it's still there?"</P><P>"Simple. If it were adrift, someone would have found it. It has to be beached on the island, probably near where we landed that morning."</P><P>"Yeah," said Lilly sarcastically. "We get in it and we sail away, and Chantel sounds the alarm. Then every clone in the place comes after us in the power boats. They'd overtake us in half a second!"</P><P>"But they don't know about our sailboat," Miley explained patiently. "So they won't think to look on the other side of the island. They'll be waiting for us to make a break for the boats at the dock. Meanwhile, we just slip out the back way."</P><P>"But—what if Trina or someone sees us out of arts and crafts?" Lilly protested.</P><P>"All we have to do is run to the woods," said Miley. "Then they'll never find us."  She looked long and hard at Lilly, interpreting her nervous expression. "If you've got any thinking to do, do it now, because as soon as Chantel goes off somewhere I'm leaving."</P><P>"I'm going too," said Lilly quickly.</P><P>Chantel walked over to inspect their drawings. "How are things coming along here?"</P><P>"Great," said Miley enthusiastically. She added something to her diagram. "Do you think I could attach a dowel here and countersink a screw on the other side to keep it steady?"</P><P>"It's a good idea," nodded Chantel.</P><P>"And what about the wood?" added Miley. "Do you think this piece would stain a nice dark walnut? I want it to match my daddy's bedroom furniture."</P><P>Chantel nodded again.  "If you sand it properly. What about yours, Truscott?"</P><P>"It's a secret," Lilly muttered, glaring at the project before her, not interested in the least.</P><P>"That figures," said Chantel with a crooked smile.</P><P>Chantel walked back to help the leather-workers. Well, who would have thought it? Every counselor in the camp was worrying about how to control Stewart and here she was, happy as a lark, building a tie rack. She was good at woodworking, too, if the design meant anything. The kid just didn't like sports, that's all. But if they kept her hands and her mind busy, she wouldn't be any trouble at all.</P><P>"Hey," Miley nudged Lilly. "What's the problem? You don't like woodworking?"</P><P>Lilly shook her head.  "My mom doesn't wear ties," she said bitterly.</P><P>"It's not for your—oh," Miley realized. "What happened to your dad?"</P><P>"Who knows? He's probably somewhere in Europe with his skank of the month."</P><P>Miley <I>hmm</I>'d sympathetically. "So make him the ugliest tie rack in the history of the world," she suggested.</P><P>A smile tugged at the corner of Lilly's mouth. "Good idea," she said, slightly cheered by the idea of putting her hostility into a 'gift' for her deadbeat father.</P><P>Chantel was just walking past Miley and Lilly again when she heard the sharp horn of the mail boat in the distance. The plans should be here—the ones she'd ordered from <I>U-Build Crafts</I>. There were all sorts of new woodworking ideas and she was anxious to see them. She glanced around the room. All heads were down, and all hands busy. There was no point in waiting until lunch to see what the mail boat had brought.</P><P>"I'll be right back," she said to the girls, and added meaningfully, <I>"right</I> back." She dashed off in the direction of Ms. Warden's cottage, where the mail was taken to the camp office to be sorted.</P><P>Like a ferret Miley stuck her head out of the arts and crafts doorway and looked around.  "Now," she said softly, and took off for the woods.</P><P>Breathing a silent prayer, Lilly ran after her. The two girls made it to the shade of the trees and kept on running.</P><P>The beaver was industriously gnawing at the base of a sapling which he planned to add to his dam. He was satisfied with himself. The dam was nearing completion. There had been no rain for a while, and his instinct told him he had several dry days left before a good one would come along to swell the creek and test his dam.</P><P>Suddenly the ground began to tremble beneath him. He looked up. Two humans were thundering through the woods directly towards him. Terrified, he scurried into the underbrush and watched with frightened eyes as the two stampeded by. One of them crashed headlong into the sapling he had been working on, and knocked it down. The human went sprawling.</P><P>"Are you all right?" asked Miley, hauling Lilly up off the ground.</P><P>Lilly nodded breathlessly. "Let's keep going! We don't know where to find that boat!"</P><P>"Don't worry," said Miley. "I've got a pretty good sense of direction."</P><P>"Oh, the orienteering champion too?"</P><P>Miley glared at her.  "Come on. And look where you're going this time."</P><P>"What do you <I>mean</I> you just went out to get the mail?" Trina shouted at Chantel. "I thought I told you not to leave them alone!"</P><P>"But they were busy. They were enjoying it." Chantel defended herself half-heartedly.</P><P>"I told you about Stewart! I told you!" yelled Trina. "Okay, okay, we have to stay calm." She looked around desperately. "Marina. <I>Marina!</I>"  She tore off in the direction of the baseball diamond, where the head counselor was acting as scorekeeper. Chantel was right behind her.</P><P>"What is it this time?" asked Marina.</P><P>"Stewart!" panted Trina. "Stewart's gone! She and Truscott escaped from arts and crafts!"</P><P>Marina blew two long blasts on her whistle to call the counselors together. They converged from all directions—from the dock, the swimming area, the obstacle course, the track, the soccer field and several of the buildings. They all crowded around Marina.</P><P>"Okay—listen, all of you! Stewart and her pal have disappeared. I want the dock sealed off and the entire compound searched. Anybody who finds them, or spots them, give three sharp blasts on the whistle. From now on, that's the Stewart alarm. Now, scramble!" She turned to Trina.  "Don't worry, Trina. They can't get far without a boat."</P><P>"Ah, here it is," said Miley with satisfaction. "I knew it would be around here somewhere."</P><P>Aside from a few scrapes, the small craft was in perfect condition. It was keeled over among the bulrushes and beached in some gravelly sand. Miley and Lilly heaved it upright and pushed it into the water.</P><P>"Hop in," Miley invited. "You hang onto the sail. I'll steer."</P><P>They boarded, and the little sailboat began to move slowly towards open water.</P><P>"They'll see us when we get round to the camp side of the island," agonized Lilly.</P><P>"They shouldn't," said Miley. "We'll make for a part of the mainland farther south than their landing dock, at the very edge of the camp view. The clones'll be watching the camp, not the water. We shouldn't have any trouble."</P><P>"Famous last words!" muttered Lilly.</P><P>"Stop complaining and hang onto that sail. It's going to take us quite a while to get to the mainland."</P><P>Trina looked around the compound in despair. "It's been more than half an hour, Marina! Where can they be?"</P><P>"Some of the girls are looking in the woods," said Marina. "Stewart and her pal are probably just hiding out so they can grab a boat tonight when we're asleep. We'll find them."</P><P>"You don't suppose they'd try to swim to the mainland?" asked Trina anxiously.  "Stewart could probably do it, you know—there and back!"</P><P>"Let's hope not," said Marina grimly. "Because I doubt if Truscott could. Anyway, I don't think we have to worry about that. I don't think Stewart is that stupid."</P><P>"What if they get hurt or lost?" asked Trina nervously. "They're only kids!"</P><P>"Don't worry," soothed Marina. "It's not your fault."</P><P>"I don't care whose fault it is," exploded Trina. "They could get <I>hurt!</I>"</P><P>Suddenly the air was shattered by three short whistle blasts.</P><P>"The dock!" exclaimed Trina. She and Marina tore off towards the waterfront.  Other counselors were also running in the direction of the alarm.</P><P>Lauren, the swimming coach, was standing on the dock gazing out over the lake through high-powered binoculars.</P><P>"A sailboat," she said, handing the binoculars to Marina. "Way out there, almost beyond our view. A little farther south and we wouldn't be able to see it at all. It looks like ours—the one that's missing. And there's two people in it."</P><P>"Stewart!" shouted Trina, grabbing the field glasses and almost removing Marina's nose in the process. "<I>You come back here!</I>'</P><P>"The boats," ordered Marina, rubbing her nose gingerly. "Let's get after them!" She and Trina jumped into a speedboat and roared off. Six counselors leapt into the main launch and followed. Four more boats, each carrying two counselors, joined the chase.</P><P>Miley leaned back and tapped the tiller with great satisfaction. "Ten more minutes should have us on the mainland."</P><P>Lilly grinned happily.  "It looks as if we're going to make it this time."</P><P>Miley nodded her agreement. "And so we bid an unfond farewell to exotic Alcatraz Island." She turned towards Algonkian. "Oh—maybe not."</P><P>"What? <I>What?</I>" Lilly stared in horror. From the island a wall of white water was starting out in their direction. "Boats!" she squeaked.</P><P>"Man the oars," said Miley calmly.</P><P>"Oars?" squealed Lilly hysterically. "They've got powerboats!"</P><P>"Yes, but we've got a head start." Miley grabbed an oar and began to paddle on one side of the boat. "Now stroke."</P><P>Lilly took the other oar and worked it madly. "We're doomed!"</P><P>"We are if we go around in circles," said Miley. "Paddle on the stroke…stroke…stroke…stroke…"</P><P>With their paddling assisting the sail, the small boat reached the mainland very quickly.  By now the girls could hear the sound of the Algonkian Island armada coming after them. They could even see Trina in the lead boat, standing up and shaking her fist. They leaped out of their sailboat and scrambled up the grassy bank.</P><P>"What are we going to do? What are we going to do?" gibbered Lilly.</P><P>"I don't know what you're going to do, but I'm going to run," replied Miley. She took off through the woods.</P><P>"Wait for me!" shouted Lilly, running after her.</P><P>"They're getting away! They're getting away!" howled Trina.</P><P>"Calm down," snapped Marina. "We'll be landing in a minute. They can't get far."</P><P>"Can't you make this thing go any faster?"</P><P>"No, I can't! Now sit down and shut up!"</P><P>The six boats soon landed and Marina addressed the counselors. "All right, you guys, they went that way." She pointed up the bank where Miley and Lilly had disappeared. "They'll probably come to that town—Snow Hill. Let's move!"</P><P>Trina had already dashed up the bank and out of sight.</P><P>"A town," said Miley. "Let's find a bus station."</P><P>"What about a telephone?" asked Lilly, glancing nervously over her shoulder. "I thought the plan was to find a telephone and call our folks."</P><P>"No time. The clones can't be far behind us. We've got to keep moving."</P><P>"Where's the bus station, then?"</P><P>"It's got to be on this street," Miley pointed out. "There are no other streets. Look, there's a cigar store. I'll go in and ask directions. You stay here and keep watch in the doorway."</P><P>"<I>Me?</I> Why me?" squealed Lilly.</P><P>Miley sighed. "Would you like to ask for directions and I'll wait outside?"</P><P>"No way!"</P><P>"Well, then…"  Miley opened the door of the small shop, stepped inside, made a fast turn and was outside like a shot, pulling Lilly down the street.</P><P>"That was quick," said Lilly. "Are we running to catch a bus?"</P><P>"Hardly," said Miley mildly. "I couldn't go into the store. Trina was there."</P><P>"Oh, no!" moaned Lilly. "Did she see you?"</P><P>"<I>Stewart!</I>" howled a familiar voice behind them.</P><P>"She saw me," confirmed Miley. "Quick. Down this alley." She pushed Lilly ahead of her into the alley and headlong into Kitty, bowling her over. Miley and Lilly pulled away and took off in another direction.</P><P>Kitty, temporarily winded, sat up and blew three short blasts on her whistle.</P><P>Miley and Lilly pounded down the middle of the road as counselors began to appear from all corners of Snow Hill.</P><P>"We're surrounded!" Lilly panted hysterically.</P><P>"Run for the lumber yard," said Miley calmly, pointing to a wide gate at the end of the street.</P><P>They made for the lumber yard, all sixteen counselors in hot pursuit. Miley vaulted over a pile of dressed lumber. Lilly scrambled after her. "What good is this going to do?" she gasped. "Now we're trapped in the yard!"</P><P>"They'll all come in here to look for us," Miley explained in a whisper, "and while they're looking we'll slip back out and get away. We don't have to stay here. There are other towns."</P><P>They heard Marina's voice calling, "They went in here! Search the place!" They could hear pounding footsteps as the crowd of counselors began to spread out and search between the rows of lumber piled everywhere.</P><P>Lilly gripped Miley's arm hard enough to cut off the circulation. Marina had appeared to the left of them. The two fugitives wheeled to the right. There, in the narrow alleyway made by the piled-up wood, was Trina. They were trapped.</P><P>Miley put her arms up in a gesture of surrender. "Comrade," she said resignedly.  Lilly stood trembling.</P><P>Trina and Marina ran up to them, each blowing three sharp whistle blasts to call the others.</P><P>"Put your hands down, Stewart," said Marina in disgust. "Don't be an idiot!"</P><P>"<I>Stewart</I>," bawled Trina, "this is the <I>end</I> of you!"</P><P>"For today," Miley agreed.</P><P>"Did you really think you could get away?" asked Marina angrily.</P><P>"We almost did," said Miley.</P><P>"Almost," echoed Lilly forlornly.</P><P>"Shut up!" snapped Trina. "Just for this you've got ten more days work detail each!"</P><P>"And kitchen duty?" prompted Miley in mock hope.</P><P>"You're off kitchen duty," grumbled Trina sourly.</P><P>"Enough chit-chat," snapped Marina. "Let's get back to the boats. And watch these two birds!"</P><P>"Birds?" repeated Miley, highly insulted. "Birds?"</P><P>"Shut up, Stewart!" growled Trina. "March!"</P><P>"Boy, oh boy, oh boy!" Kitty rubbed her hands together gleefully. "Is that Stewart ever scared to play me at chess!"</P><P>"Yeah? Says who?" muttered Trina savagely.</P><P>"I figured she tried to run away just to avoid playing me," said Kitty. "Our chess game, remember? She must have heard about my rating and chickened out."</P><P>"Forget it," said Trina firmly. "No more chess for Stewart. That's another one of her punishments."</P><P>"<I>What?</I> But my all-star baseball team—"</P><P>"Hang your all-star baseball team! It's me that has to deal with Stewart, and I say no more chess!"</P><P>"You're missing the point!" insisted Kitty. "When she loses to me she'll have to play baseball, right? She won't be able to say we're pressuring her, because she agreed to the deal. What could be worse punishment? She <I>hates</I> it!"</P><P>Trina smiled dreamily.  In her mind she had a picture of Stewart on the baseball team. It was beautiful. Stewart was so miserable. Trina frowned as the mental images changed. There was Stewart, winning the chess game—Stewart, camp director for a day. Oh, no! No, it could never happen. Kitty was twenty-three years old and had a high rating and Stewart was just a kid. It was going to be all right.</P><P>"Checkmate," said Miley quietly.</P><P>"Don't you think I know that?" cried Kitty, staring at the board incredulously.</P><P>Miley stood up. "Thank you for the game," she said formally. "If you'll excuse me, it's almost dinner time, and right after that I have work detail—ten more days, you know."</P><P>"Um-hm," muttered Kitty weakly, still staring intently at the board. Stewart had utterly destroyed her in less than twenty moves. And tomorrow Stewart was going to be camp director. Marina and the girls were going to be mad enough to chew nails.</P><P>Miley stepped outside of Cabin 3, where a large group of counselors and a few campers were waiting.</P><P>"Tough luck, Stewart," piped Trina. "This time you bit off more than you could chew."</P><P>Miley frowned at her.  "Show some respect, please," she said softly. "Tomorrow you'll be working for me."</P><P>"You <I>won?</I>" shouted Lilly.</P><P>"She won!" groaned Trina.</P><P>"Oh, <I>no!</I>" thought Marina.</P>
