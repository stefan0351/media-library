<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 21 -->

<p>"Hello?" Jessie said distractedly into the
receiver her attention focused in front of her. She'd been bothering Katie to paint
something for weeks, and finally her girlfriend acquiesced, seating herself in front of
the easel Jessie had picked up, muttering to herself as she picked up a brush. She'd
been seated there for the past two hours completely oblivious to everything around her,
and Jessie had just been watching her, never so happy to have been forgotten.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take it in the bedroom,"
Jessie said hearing her mothers voice on the other end of the phone. Katie simply nodded
her eyes never leaving the canvas in front of her.</p>

<p>"Is someone there?" Karen asked, slightly
surprised by Jessie's comment which she was sure wasn't directed at her.</p>

<p>"No one important," Jessie replied, laughing as
Katie lifted up her hand and flipped her the bird before turning her full attention back
to the easel.</p>

<p>"Is it that woman?" Karen asked wearily.</p>

<p>"It's not Dillon," Jessie replied smiling at
her mother's tone as she remembered the first and only time the two of them had met.
She and Dillon were suppose to attend a costume party for client they were working for and
Dillon had dropped by her apartment one afternoon to try on the costumes. She'd tried
to get Jessie to agree to changing together, but Jessie wasn't about to have any of
that and banished her to the washroom to change. A few minutes after that the doorbell had
rung and she'd rushed out to answer it, throwing her robe around her. It had been
Karen arriving for a surprise visit, and before Jessie could even get out a hello, Dillon
had emerged from the washroom in nothing but her underwear asking Jessie where her
handcuffs were. Then upon seeing Karen had eyed her in a quite obvious fashion and
commented that Jessie hadn't mentioned anything about this being a ménage. After
that Dillon had become 'that woman' to her mother, and Jessie was sure she would
remain that way for the rest of her days.</p>

<p>"Oh," Karen said. "Tell Grace hi for
me," she continued trying to figure out who was over at Jessie's apartment.</p>

<p>"It's not Grace," Jessie responded rolling
her eyes at her mother's obvious attempt to find out whom she was with.
"How's Henry?" she asked decided to let Karen sweat for a while.</p>

<p>"Good," Karen said her voice softening as it
always did at the mention on her husband. "That's why I'm calling
actually," she continued. "I was wondering if you wanted to come over for dinner
on Sunday, we haven't seen you for a while."</p>

<p>"I'd love to," Jessie replied smiling at the
mere thought of her and Henry kicking Karen's ass at scrabble. "Is it alright if
I bring someone along?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Karen said clearly surprised. Jessie
smirked; she was having too much fun with this. She should stop. Torturing your mother was
not supposed to be a fun pastime. "Who?"</p>

<p>"You can't wait another twenty hours to find
out?" Jessie asked plopping down on her bed.</p>

<p>"No, I really can't," Karen asked knowing
that Jessie as playing with her.</p>

<p>"Katie," Jessie said after pausing to take a deep
breath. Her mother who had once been the founder of the Katie Singer fan club had, since
their breakup, become the chair of the 'Katie Singer is Eeeeeeevil guild', which
had been joined by every member of her family, and she wasn't quite sure how Karen
would react to hearing that Katie was back.</p>

<p>"Katie Singer?" Karen asked her voice dropping
darkly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Katie Singer," Jessie responded noting her
mothers tone and thinking that it wasn't the best of signs.</p>

<p>"Oh," Karen replied.</p>

<p>"We'll talk tomorrow." Jessie said knowing
her that her mothers 'ohs' were just launching pads for interrogations and not
really wanting to get into it at the moment.</p>

<p>"Say hi for me," Karen responded though her voice
was strained.</p>

<p>"Is that all you want me to say?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>"You're funny," Karen replied knowing that
Jessie was fully aware that she had quite a few things she'd like to say to Ms.
Kathryn Singer.</p>

<p>"You keep saying that, yet you never laugh,"
Jessie replied with a faux sigh of chagrin.</p>

<p>"Goodnight," Karen replied rolling her eyes at
her daughter. Jessie was rarely this playful and she had to admit - even though it
pained her to after years of training the ass-pole to work itself into a tizzy at the
mention of Katie's name - that the other woman probably played a big part in her
daughters giddy mood. "I love you."</p>

<p>"I wuv you too," Jessie responded smiling.
"Sleep tight and give Henry a kiss for me."</p>
