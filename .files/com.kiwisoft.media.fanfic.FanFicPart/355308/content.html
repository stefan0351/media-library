<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - One Last Nightmare -->

<p>"Why didn't you ever tell me you remembered everything about that night?"
Brooke demanded quietly as she entered the kitchen after her father left. Sam
choked on her Pepsi and turned an unsightly shade of red as she tried to get the
carbonation out of her lungs. </p>
<p>"Jesus," she gasped, "will you people please stop ambushing me with things
like that when I have food in my mouth? One of these times I'm gonna choke to
death," she complained. "Then where would you be without my unique brand of
sparkling company?" Brooke walked closer, a dangerous and hurt look in her eyes.
Sam looked away, unable to keep her gaze. </p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" she repeated, almost in Sam's face now. Sam
shrugged wordlessly. "I heard you talking to Dad so I know the whole thing." Sam
brought her head up to meet Brooke's and was saddened by the tears she saw
there. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she mumbled. Brooke cupped both sides of Sam's face. </p>
<p>"You could have told me, Sammy. That's a lot of baggage to carry all by
yourself," she whispered. Tears ran down Sam's face as she looked away again.
She shrugged, unable to answer Brooke for a minute. </p>
<p>"I got it," she responded lamely as she sniffled. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Who takes care of Sammy?" Brooke asked, paraphrasing her father's earlier
question. Sam met her eyes for a second and then looked away again. </p>
<p>"You do," Sam whispered. </p>
<p>"All this time and you didn't tell me you remembered all that," Brooke
pointed out softly as she wiped away Sam's tears with her thumbs. </p>
<p>"Didn't want to upset you. Besides, I got it," she repeated a little
stronger. Brooke sighed again. (Damn the girl and her stubborn streak) Brooke
knew what this was. It was one more Sam McPherson wall built to protect the girl
from letting anyone too close to her emotions and while Brooke herself was
inside those walls as opposed to outside now, this was the one wall she didn't
even know existed. But she knew if they were going to move on, she was going to
have to get through it. (Just gotta push a little harder) </p>
<p>"So much pain." Brooke started only to have Sam pull away like she'd been
burned. She looked at Brooke, her eyes begging just as much as her voice. </p>
<p>"Brooke, please," her voice cracked. "Don't." Brooke pulled Sam back to her.
She wasn't letting her escape this. </p>
<p>"Let me in Sam," Brooke asked. Sam shook her head vehemently. </p>
<p>"Please don't. I can't. I've got this. I'm OK," she rambled desperately
although her eyes told Brooke differently. They told Brooke how lost, lonely and
hurt Sam really was and it broke Brooke's heart. Not that Sam wouldn't share but
that Sam had been carrying this burden for so long and that she had never
noticed. </p>
<p>"Sam, you've been walking around with this for months, joking about it and
laughing it away. You hold me when I cry about it, you soothe my fears when the
nightmares wake me screaming and tell me to let it go but what about you? Who
takes care of Sammy?" she again repeated. Sam tried to shake her head but Brooke
held it firmly in place. </p>
<p>"Brooke, don't...please," Brooke could see Sam's resolve fracturing as the
tears began to fall faster. She was starting to shake in Brooke's arms and her
breath was coming in jagged gasps. </p>
<p>"Let it go, Sam," Brooke whispered. Sam shook her head, succeeding this time
and tried to blink away the tears, unsuccessfully. </p>
<p>"If I do, I might never stop," she whispered back desperately. Brooke leaned
in closer and kissed her lightly. </p>
<p>"That's OK, I'll be here. I'll take care of you, Sammy. I promise." That was
all Sam needed as she leaned into Brooke's arms and began to cry in earnest.
"That's it, Sammy, let it all go. I'll be right here." Sam collapsed to her
knees as sobs, pent up since the accident, racked her small body and Brooke
cradled her long after the girl had fallen into an exhausted fitful sleep on the
kitchen floor. </p>
<p>"Maybe now the nightmares are finally over," Brooke whispered to the
slumbering form as she pressed a kiss to Sam's temple and drifted of to sleep as
well. </p>
