<P>Viola woke in her bed in a cold sweat, looking around the room, she sighed. DAMN. It hadn't been a dream, she had said those horrible things to Olivia, kicked the girl when she was down. Glancing around the room again, Viola spotted the clock. At a quarter to midnight, Viola pulled on her shirt and tracksuit pants and left her dorm room, to make it better with the girl she loved.</p>
<P>Olivia was lying awake in bed, listening to the gentle snoring Sebastian was making as he lay beside her. She felt worse than she had before, using Sebastian to make herself feel loved, had just resulted in complicating the situation. As she lay there, Olivia thought over Viola's words.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">"<I>Now I know how Sebastian feels"</I></p>
<P>Well that made one of them, as Olivia repeated the words in her head, she realized she didn't know how Sebastian felt, about anything. How he felt about their relationship, and his input in that. She cursed silently, how could she not have taken his feelings into account. As she lay there thinking through all of this, what she felt back at the coffee shop came back to haunt. Olivia didn't think of Sebastian's feelings, because she didn't want Sebastian, not in the slightest. During her minutes of pure ecstasy, hours before, it had been Viola name her heart had wanted to scream, Viola she had wanted to bring her there. In none of her thoughts was Sebastian present, they were both holding onto something that was dieing. Their relationship was destined to fall and Olivia thought of Viola, realizing she no longer wanted to stop the inevitable. Resolving to tell Viola at the picnic on the weekend and to tell Sebastian after that, Olivia drifted into a peaceful sleep. Just in time for Viola to knock on the door.</p>
<P>Sebastian awoke to the soft thud of the door, he looked over at the peaceful Olivia, and smiled, believing he had brought that peace to her. Pulling on his boxer shorts, Sebastian went to answer the door.</p>
<P>Viola jumped nervously on the spot, bouncing up and down, from shear lack of anything better to do, she had no idea what she was going to say. It was just after midnight and most people were either cramping or sleeping, she bounced quietly, all she knew was that she had to see Olivia, had to talk to her. She had to make this right.</p>
<P>Sebastian opened the door, slightly surprised that his sister was here at this hour, rubbing his head to see in light supplied by the hall, he blinked a few times. Viola didn't move, Sebastian had opened the door in his boxer shorts, his hair was all messed up, he had and then Olivia had. She couldn't breathe, couldn't even finish her thoughts.</p>
<P>"Vi what are you doing here?", asked Sebastian, but before he could say anything else she ran down the hall.</p>
<P>Sebastian looked puzzled, shutting the door, he went back to bed. Climbing in with Olivia, who awoke at the movement.</p>
<P>"Who was it?", asked Olivia.</p>
<P>"Viola", said Sebastian settling down again.</p>
<P>"Did she say anything?", asked Olivia sitting up at the mention of Viola.</p>
<P>"Nope, she took one look at me and ran the other way", said Sebastian closing his eyes.</p>
<P>Olivia settled back down, maybe she hadn't worked it out, maybe everything would be okay. Olivia would tell Viola everything at the picnic and all would be okay. Olivia sighed, or so she hoped.</p>
<P>Viola walked back to her dorm room, the tears just wouldn't stop falling, it was like a fountain had erupted in her eyes, she just couldn't hold them back. Stopping under a tree, on the grass, Viola collapsed to her knees and screamed.</p>
<P>This could not be happening, Olivia and Sebastian had... just after she'd fought with Olivia. Viola just sat on the ground not moving just thinking over everything she had seen, heard and done. This whole situation had gotten completely out of control. Thinking over the pain she was now feeling, Viola suddenly started laughing, not a happy laugh but a sad almost crazy laugh. The one goal of this whole situation had been met, Olivia and Sebastian had a better relationship. Viola laughed and cried all at once, life truly was cruel.</p>
<P>The next day, Sebastian got up early to catch Viola at her dorm room before she went to work, he jogged over there and knocked on the door. No one replied, so he tried again and again there was no reply, as Sebastian became concerned, Duke came around the corner.</p>
<P>"Duke", said Sebastian, Duke just glared at him, as he walked up to the door.</p>
<P>"Viola's not coming out... do you know where she is?", asked Sebastian, Duke just stepped past him and opened the door with his spare key.</p>
<P>"Thanks Duke", said Sebastian, as Duke stepped into the room.</p>
<P>Before Sebastian could step in, Duke slammed the door in his face and locked it for the other side. Sebastian stood their bewildered.</p>
<P>"Well um can you tell her I stopped by... and thank you for the notes", yelled Sebastian through the door.</p>
<P>Duke just shook his head and headed to the bedroom.</p>
<P>"Oh and that I'm going to the picnic so if she could not tell Olivia cause its a surprise that would be great", yelled Sebastian to no one.</p>
<P>"Thank you", yelled Sebastian and then he gave up, and went to his first class of the day.</p>
<P>Viola was lying in her bed, she didn't even look up when Duke came in.</p>
<P>"How you feeling, champ?", asked Duke, sitting down on the bed.</p>
<P>"She got what she want", said Viola trying not to cry.</p>
<P>Duke rubbed her back.</p>
<P>"I know, I know", he said.</p>
<P>"She.. they... ahhhh I just... I love her", said Viola the tears coming into her eyes, again.</p>
<P>"I know you do, sweety", said Duke pulling Viola into a sitting position.</p>
<P>"But you listen to me, okay. You are too good for her", said Duke looking Viola in the eyes.</p>
<P>"You are too good", repeated Duke, pulling Viola into a hug.</p>
<P>Viola cried on his shoulder, everything she wanted was gone and now Sebastian had it.</p>
<P>"What did Sebastian want?", asked Viola pulling away to wipe her eyes.</p>
<P>Duke looked uneasy, he really didn't want to hurt Viola more.</p>
<P>"What?", asked Viola sensing this was bad.</p>
<P>"He wanted to thank you", said Duke slowly.</p>
<P>Viola nodded her head, knowing there was more.</p>
<P>"And he said he's going to the picnic", said Duke.</p>
<P>Viola nodded again just before the tears started up again, Duke pulled her into another hug. It figures that Sebastian would start being a good boyfriend just as Viola lost Olivia. Duke stroked Viola's hair, he felt bad for her, she didn't deserve this and neither did Olivia.</p>
