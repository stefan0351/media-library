<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Thirty-Three -->

<p>Kara laughed as Ginny surveyed the room, trying to find the perfect place to
			hang the Big Tree. Kara already knew it would go over the fireplace, but Ginny
			wanted to be certain it was the best place for them to see it at all times.</p>
		<p>They bought the Dobson cabin together. It needed a little work, but they had
			time. In the past month, they had been to Seattle to collect some of Kara's
			things and they moved most of Ginny's from Nana's house. Nana had not yet
			accepted this. She didn't understand the love they had for each other and Kara
			didn't blame her. But she knew it was very hard for Ginny. Louise could hardly
			stay in the same room as Kara now.</p>
		<p>"She'll come around," Ginny had said. "Give her time."</p>
		<p>Kara's eyes followed Ginny across the room, watching her. Her heart swelled
			with love each and every time she looked at her. Kara knew she had never been so
			happy in all her life. Finally, she felt at home.</p>
		<p>"You know what I think?" Ginny asked as she stood with her hands perched on
			her hips.</p>
		<p>"What's that?"</p>
		<p>"I think we should hang it over the fireplace."</p>
		<p>Kara arched one eyebrow.</p>
		<p>"Really? What a wonderful idea," she teased.</p>
		<p>Ginny walked slowly towards her, her own eyebrow raised. </p>
		<p>"Do you have any idea how sexy you are?" Ginny asked. She slid her arms
			around Kara and pressed her hips intimately against her. Kara responded
			instantly.</p>
		<p>But Ginny pulled away, a grin on her face.</p>
		<p>"So, will you help me hang it?"</p>
		<p>"Now?" Kara asked, trying to pull Ginny back.</p>
		<p>"Yes, now. Baby, we spent the entire morning in bed."</p>
		<p>"And what's wrong with the afternoon, too?"</p>
		<p>Ginny laughed, then laughed harder when she saw that Kara was serious.</p>
		<p>"We did that yesterday."</p>
		<p>"And?"</p>
		<p>Ginny reached out and cupped Kara's cheek, her eyes soft upon her.</p>
		<p>"Why haven't you been painting?"</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged. "I've been busy."</p>
		<p>"You haven't painted since you've been back."</p>
		<p>Kara dipped her head, then looked up shyly at Ginny. "I'd rather be with
			you," she said.</p>
		<p>Ginny heard the words behind the words. She moved closer to Kara, one hand
			sliding easily under her shirt to touch warm skin.</p>
		<p>"I'm not Marsha," she said.</p>
		<p>Kara looked up, surprised. "I know. I just . . .."</p>
		<p>"I'm not going to leave you. I won't go out with friends because you're not
			paying me enough attention, honey. Painting is your life," she said.</p>
		<p>"You're my life."</p>
		<p>"No. I'm a part of your life. Painting is, too. It's who you are. It's what
			makes you special."</p>
		<p>"I don't want to fall into the same trap, Ginny. I get so involved, I just
			lose track of time."</p>
		<p>"Then I'll remind you. And if I feel like you're ignoring me, I'll sneak up
			behind you," she said, moving behind Kara as she spoke. "Like this," she
			whispered, moving both hands under Kara's shirt now, sliding up to cup her
			breasts. "And I'll tell you that I need you," she murmured into her ear. She
			felt Kara's heart pounding beneath her hands and she closed her eyes, so sure of
			their love for each other. She slid one hand lower, along Kara's thigh and felt
			her tremble in her arms. "And I know you'll stop what you're doing, because you
			love me . . . and you want me."</p>
		<p>Kara turned quickly and captured Ginny, wrapping long arms around her before
			kissing her soundly.</p>
		<p>"Are you teasing me?" she murmured against her mouth.</p>
		<p>"Never."</p>
		<p>Their mouths met again, harder, and their bodies moved together in a dance
			that was known only to them.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Louise stood in the opened doorway, a witness to a love she never thought
			she'd see. She'd heard laughter from inside and walked up the wooden steps,
			unnoticed. She saw, for the first time, Ginny's happiness. She could see it in
			her eyes as she looked at Kara. She could see it as Ginny moved to the other
			woman, touching her so naturally that Louise blushed with the genuine love she
			saw there. And Kara. Oh, her eyes followed Ginny around the room, a smile
			touching her face just from being in her presence. She saw their teasing, their
			affection for one another. It reminded her of her own marriage. </p>
		<p>How could she have disapproved of this? Had she ever seen Ginny so happy? But
			then, they had moved together, had touched in ways Louise could never have
			imagined.</p>
		<p>She cleared her throat loudly, coughing lightly. The couple pulled apart
			quickly, a crimson blush lighting Ginny's face immediately.</p>
		<p>"Nana!"</p>
		<p>"I thought I should intervene before I witnessed something far too personal
			for grandmothers," she said lightly, stepping fully into the room</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry. I . . . I didn't expect you," Ginny said and she moved farther
			away from Kara.</p>
		<p>Louise took a deep breath and clasped her granddaughter's hands. </p>
		<p>"Ginny, don't be sorry. I'm the one who should be sorry. I couldn't see the
			love you have for her. I couldn't imagine . . . what you could have with Kara."
			She glanced quickly at Kara, a woman she had admired before and then shunned.
			She knew that she was wrong. "I have never seen you so happy."</p>
		<p>Ginny's eyes misted over and she hugged Nana tightly. She had been so afraid
			she had lost her love.</p>
		<p>"I love her," Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I can see that. I'm sorry I judged you."</p>
		<p>Ginny pulled away from Nana and grabbed for Kara's hand. She pulled her close
			to her side, her eyes meeting Nana's again.</p>
		<p>"I've found my magic, Nana," Ginny whispered. "I so want you to be happy for
			me."</p>
		<p>"I am." She raised her eyes to Kara, meeting the blue, blue eyes of the woman
			who loved her Ginny. "I'm happy for you both. I'm sorry it's taken me this long
			to see what you have."</p>
		<p>Kara lifted a corner of her mouth in a smile. Louise had come around.</p>
		<p>"We're having lasagna for dinner, Louise. I hope you'll stay," she
			offered.</p>
		<p>"Of course. And I'd like to look around. I haven't been to the Dobson place
			in years. Imagine, Ginny, married forty years and divorcing. Why, I declare . .
			. it's not like your grandfather and I didn't have fights. But we would never
			let it come to this. We would work through it. People nowadays . . .."</p>
		<p>Kara listened as her voice trailed off when Ginny led her through the cabin,
			showing her the kitchen.</p>
		<p>She smiled as Ginny shot her a glance over Nana's shoulder. Everything was
			complete. Nana had come around.</p>
		<p>She followed them into the kitchen and grabbed a beer and her cigarettes and
			moved to the deck in the back, ignoring the light mist that surrounded her. She
			lit her cigarette easily, listening as Ginny and Nana moved about the house,
			Ginny telling her about the plans they had.</p>
		<p>She tired to think of a time in her life when she'd felt more content, more
			at home, and she couldn't. There was nothing else in her life that could compare
			to this. She knew without a doubt that she loved Ginny completely. As she also
			knew that Ginny loved her. </p>
		<p>"Baby?"</p>
		<p>Before she could turn, a gentle hand stroked her back.</p>
		<p>"You okay?" Ginny asked.</p>
		<p>Kara turned and moved into Ginny's arms, hugging her tightly to her
			chest.</p>
		<p>"I'm so in love with you."</p>
		<p>She felt Ginny smile against her neck, then soft lips nibbled there.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Kara . . . don't you know what you do to me? I love you, too,
			sweetheart."</p>
		<p>Their bodies pulled apart, but their eyes did not. Green locked on blue and
			they smiled. Slow, gentle smiles that touched their hearts . . . and souls. </p>
