<!-- Stranger In Her Eyes \ Epilogue -->

<p>Buffy caught sight of Willow sitting at a table at the Quad, waiting for her.  She grinned
broadly, stepped up behind Willow, and wrapped her arms around her shoulders.  "Hey,
honey," she whispered in her ear, as she nibbled the earlobe.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself," Willow greeted her wife, leaning back into her embrace.  She got up and
hugged Buffy back.  "How did classes go?"</p>

<p>"Slowly, Wills, slowly," Buffy admitted.  "All I could think about was you, in that huge bed in
our suite at the Piedmont."</p>

<p>"Oh," teased Willow.  "What was I wearing, pray tell?"</p>

<p>Buffy grinned lasciviously.  "Nothing but a smile."</p>

<p>"Well, then, time to turn dream into reality."  And she kissed Buffy soundly on the lips.</p>

<p>As they strolled away from the campus, Buffy asked, "Hey, Wills, you hear from Tara?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow answered, her voice carrying strains of melancholy.  "I bumped into her
between classes.  She's talking about moving away from Sunnydale."</p>

<p>Buffy looked away from Willow, feeling guilty at the anger she had harbored toward the
tragic young blond.  "I hope she'll change her mind."</p>

<p>"Me too, Buff.  The thing is, I see a lot of myself in her."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"I was that same wallflower for most of my life.  To afraid to talk to anyone, crushing on
Xander but never getting up the nerve to tell him.  I always make jokes about my 'frog fear',
but the fact is, for me, it was 'everything fear'.  Then, one day it all changed."</p>

<p>"Oh?  How?"</p>

<p>Willow turned her face to Buffy, joy shining in her eyes.  "A girl my age told off some of
Cordy's followers, and then asked me for some help with her homework.  And then,
between turning my life around by day and fighting undead skanky evil at night, she became
the most important person in my life."</p>

<p>"Really," Buffy smiled, as tears of happiness welled in her eyes.  "I'll have to look this girl up."</p>

<p>Willow slapped Buffy playfully, and said, "C'mon, Buffy.  Let's get back to our honeymoon.
We've still got five days left."</p>

<p>"Wrong, Willow," Buffy took Willow in her arms, and kissed her passionately.  "We've got
the rest of our lives."</p>

<p>As the two young women kissed, they were unaware of an interloper standing behind a large
oak tree.  The dark-haired woman had been following the Slayer for the last few hours, and
was taking in the sight of the Slayer and her beloved, openly and happily kissing each other.</p>

<p>"So," she mused as she lit a cigarette.  She stole one last glance at the two lovers, took a
deep drag from her cigarette and exhaled a gout of smoke before moving on. "B and Red
don't drive stick anymore?  Wicked cool! Who woulda thunk?" She smiled to herself,
considering what she should do with this new information.  </p>
