<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 19 -->

<p>When Annika opened her eyes the next morning it was to the sight of the sun-dappled canvas roof of the tent.  It took her a moment to get her bearings and realize where she was, and whom she was with.  Glancing down she was treated to the sight of B'Elanna's face, peaceful in repose.  She was shocked by how young and innocent her love looked when she was sleeping.  The contrast between the peaceful woman she saw now and the fierce warrior she had seen B'Elanna to be was striking.  It was hard to imagine that anyone believed that this sleeping beauty was a man, let alone a knight who ruled the tournament grounds and had taken the lives of three men in her short life.  It was odd to note that the violence with which she lived had not left its mark on her visage.  She could be any young woman as she slept here now.  </p>
<p>Her body was a different story.  Annika drank in the sight of her warrior wife's powerful body.  She admired the planes and angles of her face, and the peaks and valleys of her rippling muscles.  No woman looked like that, and Annika was quietly proud that she had managed to win the heart of such a one.  She stretched out her body, and for the first time she was aware of how good it felt to stretch out her muscles.  All of her life she had taken her body for granted?knowing that its only purpose was decoration and childbearing.  She had never paid attention to how it felt, had never been present in her own body before now.  Last night had been a revelation of pleasure and sensation for her.  It had awakened her to possibilities she had never before imagined.  She stretched out again slowly, for the first time paying attention to how each movement felt.  She was feeling stiff and a little sore from her exertions both on the road and in bed last night, but she was surprised at how pleasurable and satisfying even that slight amount of pain could be.</p>
<p>She was feeling restless and did not wish to disturb B'Elanna's sleep so she eased out of her arms and out of bed.  She looked at her clothing strewn about the room and realized with chagrin that due to the nature of her clothing she was unable to dress herself without help.  Spying the loose linen shirt that B'Elanna had been wearing at their wedding she slipped it over her head.  It was loose and baggy and fell to midway down her thighs. The feeling of the clothing, and the fact that she was not wearing any of her customary restrictive undergarments was wonderful, as was the fact that the shirt was imbued with the wonderful scent of her wife's body.  She padded barefoot around the tent, pouring herself a drink of water and sipping the cool liquid while she explored her unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
<p>B'Elanna drifted into wakefulness slowly; she felt a sense of loss, inexplicable until she realized that she was alone in the bed.  She felt the covers beside her, still warm from Annika's body heat.  Opening her eyes wider and looking around she saw her wife drinking a glass of water on the other side of the tent.  She watched the beautiful young women tilt her head back, throat working as she swallowed.  She noticed with a smile that Annika was wearing her shirt.  Far from disguising her curves, the loose flowing material served to highlight the sensual beauty of her lover's body.  B'Elanna felt a surge of desire as Annika moved, the sun coming from the tent walls backlighting her body so that she was treated to a perfect silhouette of Annika's form.    </p>
<p>She levered herself up on to one elbow in order to have a better view of her wife as she moved about the tent.  Noticing that B'Elanna was awake Annika smiled shyly at her lover.  Upon seeing the answering smile spread over B'Elanna's face, she set down the cup and moved quickly back toward the bed, pulling the shirt off over her head as she walked.</p>
<p>Several hours later they finally managed to find the time to eat a simple breakfast of bread and cheese.  They were both feeling tired and hot so they decided to walk to the river for a swim.  Annika refused to relinquish the shirt she had purloined from B'Elanna so they dressed very similarly in tights and loose fitting shirts tied at the waist.  Neither of them bothered with constrictive undergarments and so they both felt rather exposed as they walked, but the woods were deserted and soon they forgot to be self-conscious and merely enjoyed the sense of freedom this type of dress engendered.  </p>
<p>They walked along the river until they found a secluded spot where the stream widened into a pool.  It took several minutes but B'Elanna finally talked Annika into removing her clothing and stepping into the water.  The younger woman did not know how to swim, but B'Elanna told her not to worry that she would look after her, and she knew B'Elanna would never put her at risk.  She let herself fall back into B'Elanna's waiting arms and the young warrior held her on her chest and kicked back into the pool.  Even though she couldn't swim she had absolute trust in B'Elanna's ability to hold her up and keep her from harm.  She leaned back, feeling her wife's perfect breasts pressing into her back, her strong brown hands resting on her belly as she moved them around the pool.</p>
<p>After floating around the pond for a little more than half an hour B'Elanna guided them over to water shallow enough for them to gain their feet.  Using a soapstone that she had brought along for the purpose they bathed in the slowly flowing water.  B'Elanna then searched along the shallow water until she found the arrowroot plant she needed.  Pulling several of the plants up by their roots she squeezed the milky juice from the roots and massaged it into Annika's scalp.  The liquid turned into a sudsy foam that washed the dirt and oil from her beautiful blonde hair. While Annika was used to the sensation of someone else bathing her, to B'Elanna the feeling of Annika's fingers massaging her scalp was amazing.  She leaned back and reveled in the feeling and Annika was more than happy to rub her new wife's head as long as B'Elanna was content to have her do so.</p>
<p>When they were both cleaned and rinsed they climbed out of the water and lay on the grass in the sunlight to dry.  Annika was unused to the feel of the sun on her skin, as it was not considered ladylike to for a woman of breeding to have any pigmentation to her skin. She couldn't believe what she had been missing her entire life as she felt the warmth of the sun and of the ground soaking into her bones.  She rolled onto her side and watched as the sun dried the droplets of water from B'Elanna's caramel coloured skin. Surprised at how quickly she became aroused just by looking at the muscular body of the woman she loved, she couldn't stop herself from reaching out to touch the sun-kissed skin of her lover.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna kept her eyes closed as Annika explored her body with fingers growing ever bolder by the minute.  She couldn't suppress a shudder of delight when she felt Annika's mouth join her hands in their exploration, and she could no longer keep still as she felt the weight of Annika's slight frame settle between her legs.  She wound her arms around her Lady's body, drawing her ever closer until their lips met?touching off a storm of passion that would not be denied.</p>
<p>It was over an hour later when B'Elanna awoke on the sun drenched grass, Annika was asleep on her shoulder, the weight of her head a blessed burden on the warrior's arm.  The raven-haired woman brushed the hair back that was covering her wife's beautiful face and when treated to a full unobstructed view of the face of beauty she once again marveled at her luck in finding and capturing the heart of one so perfect for her as Annika.  In truth she could have laid on this bank all day and merely stared at the sleeping face of her wife and lover, but the growling of her stomach told her that she needed to make her way back to the enclave and find something to eat.  She kissed Annika's forehead softly, feeling the beautiful woman stir under her caress; slowly she kissed her way down to her Lady's perfect lips and captured them gently, feeling Annika awake in her arms and slowly begin to respond to her touch.  When they were both sated on the taste of one another for the moment B'Elanna moved her head back to get a better look at the beauty she held in her arms.</p>
<p>"Much as I hate to admit it I think we had better make our way back to the village my love," she said in a soft voice.</p>
<p>"Let me guess my warrior wife, your stomach is empty and you would rather fill its bottomless chasm then stay here and make love to your new wife?"  Annika teased, kissing B'Elanna once again to ensure her wife knew she was only having a bit of fun.</p>
<p>"The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak my love, and so will I be if I do not eat soon.  You can't very well have your wife starve to death on the day after your wedding now can you?"  B'Elanna gave back as good as she got, loving this new, more playful, side to her wife.</p>
<p>"Very well, then I suppose we ought to be on our way before I am forced to carry you back to the village myself," Annika said as he began to look around for their clothing which had been thrown haphazardly around the small clearing.  As they dressed Annika's stomach let out a most unladylike growl that sent them both into gales of laughter.</p>
<p>They made their way quickly back to their tent where they ate the last of the bread and cheese that was left over from breakfast.  Such a small amount of food was not sufficient for either of them and so they decided to get dressed and make their way back to their camp in search of a real meal.  When they had polished off the last of the food they were both a bit shy about asking for help with dressing, although neither of them was capable of clothing themselves completely without help.  Annika picked up the pile of cloth that B'Elanna used to bind her chest.</p>
<p>"Show me how to do this my love," she asked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pulled the shirt she had been wearing off over her head and approached Annika.  She told her how the cloth needed to be wound tightly and tied off in order that her chest appeared as flat as possible.  Annika worked in silence until she was satisfied with the result of her work.</p>
<p>"Who performs this task for you normally?" she queried.</p>
<p>"Harry has always been the one to help me dress," B'Elanna replied truthfully.</p>
<p>Annika felt an emotion unlike any other she had experienced before.  She knew that Harry and B'Elanna were like brother and sister, but somehow the thought of anyone but herself seeing her wife's body bothered her.  A small frown appeared on her face prompting B'Elanna to inquire as to what the matter was.</p>
<p>"I do not like the idea of Harry seeing you without your clothing on," she admitted finally.</p>
<p>"Annika, honestly, its only Harry."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, from now on I will be the one to help you dress in the mornings.  I wish to be the only one who is lucky enough to touch your skin and see your beautiful body."</p>
<p>"As you wish my love, but you do realize then that you must show me how to dress you, for I will be the only one to have that privilege from this point forward."</p>
<p>Annika smiled at the thought of her warrior wife struggling with the stays of her corset, but she had to admit that B'Elanna had a point.  It took them both much longer than usual to get dressed but in the end they managed make themselves presentable, although Annika was forced to wear her hair loose over her shoulders as B'Elanna was unable to master the art of putting it up in the regular style that Annika wore.  When they were finally finished dressing they walked back along the path until it joined up with the road.  They followed the sounds of voices until they found themselves in the village.  They were both pleased to find that their entire group of friends had returned to the village from their campsite this afternoon and so they sat down to the evening meal surrounded by everyone they held dear.</p>
<p>That night they sat in the village around a huge fire and listened to the songs and the stories of the villagers.  It was a night of happy and carefree laughter and joy.  Both Annika and B'Elanna felt more at ease here with these people than they had ever felt, and it took some time and discussion before they realized that it was because these people were among the few on earth who knew them in their entirety.  The villagers knew that B'Elanna was a woman, and they knew and accepted the nature of their relationship without judgement or disapproval.  It was a rare feeling and one they both accepted they would find in few places on earth.  The happiness and ease they felt here among these people would make their departure tomorrow all that much harder.  Nevertheless they were both committed to the path they had chosen, and it warmed them to know that they would always be able to find sanctuary here among people of the forest.</p>
<p>It was well after midnight when they all decided to call it a night.  Annika and B'Elanna held hands as they made their way by torchlight back to their tent.  B'Elanna carried a package of food for the morning and they had made arrangements with Harry and Tom to meet in the village in the morning to strike both of their camps together.  There was no shyness or trepidation between them this night as they reached their tent.  Annika's hands shook with anticipation and not fear as she helped B'Elanna out of her clothing, and soon they were together on the bed and in one another's arms.  Instead of falling asleep when their passion was spent however, they found themselves talking about the past few days and about their lives together.  B'Elanna had never in her life been much for words, and she was shocked to find that conversation felt as close and as intimate as their lovemaking had.  It was several hours before they finally fell asleep, safe at last in one another's arms.</p>
<p>The next morning they awoke at dawn despite the late hour at which they had finally fallen asleep.  They dressed quickly, becoming as they were, more intimately acquainted with the methods required to put on one another's clothing. When they were finished dressing the two of them together took down the tent that had been their only home since they were married two days ago.  While they were sad to be leaving the village behind them they were both looking forward to traveling to London for the last tournament of the season.  They enjoyed time spent on the road in one another's company and in the company of their friends. When they finished with the task of striking camp they stood for a moment in one another's arms before walking back to the village to meet their companions.</p>
<p>When they finally reached the village centre they were surprised to find that Sarah was standing with the group and that she had a small pile of belongings in a sack at her feet.  B'Elanna was unsure of what to do or say to this so she merely nodded to the group and waited for Harry to explain what was happening.  As she expected the young man approached her quickly and asked that he might have a word in private.  They walked a few feet away from the group and Harry took B'Elanna's arm and spoke in a hesitant voice.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I know we are bursting at the seams as it is, and I know that you are worried about money.  But I was thinking that perhaps I could find some way to contribute financially?perhaps I could sell some of the game I catch in town or something?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled at his earnest attempt to alleviate her fears.</p>
<p>"Harry?it's all right?I just didn't know it was this serious."</p>
<p>"It is," he replied simply.</p>
<p>"Then the best argument for having her along is that you love her.  As to your financial contributions, Harry you already do more than your share of work on behalf of our little family.  Don't worry, we'll be fine.  The prizes at London are huge and should be more than enough for us to live on during the winter.  I'm happy for you Harry, everyone should have a chance to be as happy as Annika and I are now that we are finally together."</p>
<p>Now that the issue was settled Harry and the others began the job of loading up the wagon which was already full to the brim now that they had an extra tent to carry along with them.  Annika went out of her way to ensure that Sarah felt welcomed into the close-knit group.  It was obvious the young woman was no stranger to physical labour and B'Elanna watched, impressed with the ease with which the slender girl tossed the awkward and heavy canvas into the wagon.  She smiled to herself as she watched Harry and his new love work together.  They shared the same secret glances and fleeting touches that she and Annika did, and she was certain that Harry had chosen well the woman with whom he would share his heart and his life.  </p>
<p>In no time at all the wagon was loaded and the group bade a fond farewell to their friends and family.  They exchanged embraces and promises to return soon before they were once again on the road toward London.  B'Elanna dropped back to ride beside Harry and the two of them watched as Sarah, Annika and Kate chatted and giggled as they traveled.  The group was indeed bursting at the seams, but bursting with love and happiness and humour.  Rather than being more worried about their future now that their group had grown so large B'Elanna was in fact feeling calmer.  As long as they had each other she was certain that there was nothing they could not face together.</p>
<p>Smiling she spurred Goliath forward until she caught up with Annika.  With one arm she reached over and pulled her wife from her saddle until she was sitting sideways in her lap.  Her strong arm kept her anchored there and she kissed her quickly.</p>
<p>"I thought you might like to ride with me for a while.  I've missed you this morning," she whispered, her works for Annika's ears only.</p>
<p>Annika settled herself more comfortably in her new seat, resting her head on B'Elanna's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I love you too."</p>
