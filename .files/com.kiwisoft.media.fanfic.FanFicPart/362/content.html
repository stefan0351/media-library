<p>"Buffy! You little bitch! Did you forget to turn on the water heater again?" Buffy's older sister Anya screamed.</p>
<p>"N-No, I?"</p>
<p>"Don't interrupt me! And don't contradict me. Now, how many times have I told you that I want the water warm when I take a shower, hmm?"</p>
<p>"I-I-I?"</p>
<p>"You what?" Anya asked and glared at her, causing Buffy to look down, scared. "I guess that means no shower for you and you know what that means, don't you? You sleep outside in the hall tonight, I won't have your smelly ass under my nose all night."</p>
<p>"I-I c-could t-take a c-cold sh-shower," Buffy stuttered nervously.</p>
<p>Anya snorted.</p>
<p>"You could, but you're not. Perhaps this will teach you to remember what you're told next time."</p>
<p>"Y-Yes, A-Anya," Buffy said, subdued.</p>
<p>"Good, now get lost."</p>
<p>Buffy quickly scurried away.</p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going?" her stepmother stopped her.</p>
<p>"O-Out," Buffy quietly said.</p>
<p>"Out! Aren't you forgetting something? You're supposed to do the dishes."</p>
<p>"I-I know, b-but A-Anya?"</p>
<p>"Don't you dare involving Anya in this. Do the dishes. Now."</p>
<p>"Y-Yes, M-Ma'am."</p>
<p>"Useless little bitch," her stepmother murmured and went to the bedroom.</p>
<p>A minute later, Cordelia, her other stepsister, came in.</p>
<p>"Are you still doing the dishes?" she asked, annoyed. "Why does it always take you so long? Can't you do anything on time?"</p>
<p>She shook her head, disgusted, and left. And not a moment later, Anya entered.</p>
<p>"What are you still doing here?" she demanded, slapping Buffy on the back of the head. "I thought I told you to get your ass the hell out of here."</p>
<p>"Y-Yes."</p>
<p>"Then what are you still doing here?"</p>
<p>"D-Dishes."</p>
<p>Anya looked at the dishes.</p>
<p>"Then do them and then get out."</p>
<p>"Y-Yes."</p>
<p>Anya left and Buffy concentrated on doing the dishes again and tried not to cry. After she was done, she went outside. Not a minute passed and she heard her stepmother yelling again.</p>
<p>"Where is that little bitch now?!"</p>
<p>"I sent her out, Mom," Anya said.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"She forgot to turn on the water heater, so I told her to sleep outside as punishment."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Actually, I used up all the water," Cordelia said.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Whatever. She can sleep outside."</p>
<p>The three women laughed and Buffy silently cried herself to sleep.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Wake up, you little slut!"</p>
<p>Buffy gasped as the owner of the voice kicked her in the ribs. She opened her eyes and saw it was her stepmother.</p>
<p>"Get up and make us some breakfast. Move!"</p>
<p>Buffy quickly got up and went in.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After the usual morning torture, her stepmother drove her stepsisters to school and Buffy cleaned up. Then she quickly took a cold shower, changed her clothes and went to school.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>She arrived just on time to see Faith Spencer get out of her Beetle. She stared at her, wide-eyed. She knew she shouldn't be daydreaming about Faith, but she couldn't help herself. Faith was a gorgeous girl and she felt herself attracted to her, but she knew that she didn't stand a chance with Faith, even though she had heard rumors that Faith was gay. Faith was also rich and that meant that Buffy was way below her rank. Not that Faith had ever noticed her before.</p>
<p>The moment passed as Faith entered the building, and Buffy quickly hurried in herself, not wanting to be late for class.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Buffy was just busy getting her books from her looker when she heard Faith's voice.</p>
<p>"Hey, Xander."</p>
<p>"Hey, Faith. How's it going?"</p>
<p>"Not good. I still don't have a date for the Homecoming Dance."</p>
<p>Xander chuckled.</p>
<p>"That's hard to believe."</p>
<p>"Oh, I could get a date, easily, but I just don't want to spend the whole night giving some boy false hope."</p>
<p>Xander grinned.</p>
<p>"Then ask a girl."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"I wish. But I want someone intelligent, you know, not some airhead."</p>
<p>"You're gay?" another voice cut in.</p>
<p>"Oh, Harmony. Yes, I'm gay. You have a problem with it?"</p>
<p>Harmony snorted.</p>
<p>"Puh-lese. You can date a dog for all I care."</p>
<p>"And you'd still be jealous."</p>
<p>"In your dreams."</p>
<p>"I don't think so. You're not my type."</p>
<p>Harmony huffed.</p>
<p>"As if. I wouldn't go to bed with you and if we were the last people alive."</p>
<p>"The feeling's mutual. Here, why don't I spare you the pains of spreading the news behind my back." Faith turned to the people. "Hey, people, listen up!" she called and everyone stopped, curious. "Harmony just discovered my terrible secret." She grinned. "Those of you who still don't know, I'm gay," she said and several people gasped. "Yes, you heard it right, gay. I just though I'd save Harmony the trouble of spreading the news around. That's all, thank you." Faith turned back to Harmony, who was staring at her, surprised. "There, all taken care of."</p>
<p>Harmony huffed angrily and left with her friends. Faith and Xander chuckled.</p>
<p>"Poor Harmony," Xander said, shaking his head. "Not."</p>
<p>Faith grinned.</p>
<p>"I'm such a bitch sometimes."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah."</p>
<p>"Hi, Xander."</p>
<p>"Oh, hi, Willow," Xander greeted the shy girl as she passed by.</p>
<p>"She still have a crush on you?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah," Xander said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Does she know you're gay?"</p>
<p>"Yes." He grinned. "Hey, maybe you could ask her out."</p>
<p>Faith chuckled.</p>
<p>"She'll probably pass out if I just talk to her. And if I ask her out, she'll have a heart attack," she said and Xander chuckled as well. "And besides, she's straight."</p>
<p>"So? Perhaps she'd like to experiment. Maybe you could show her the life on the other side of the fence."</p>
<p>Faith grinned.</p>
<p>"Perhaps."</p>
<p>"Oh, anyway, my boyfriend, Oz, he's sick and won't make it to the dance. Would you mind going with me?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>They left and Buffy realized that she had stopped breathing. She quickly took a few deep breaths. She was stunned. Faith was gay? It was? It was like? a dream come true. Sort of. Not like she would ever have a chance with Faith, but a girl could dream. And to a girl like dreams were all she had.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Mom, you're not gonna believe what I heard today," Anya said when she and Cordelia came home. "Remember that rich bitch I told you about, Faith Spencer? She's gay."</p>
<p>"Really?" her mother said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Cordelia said. "And apparently she gives rich presents to her ex-girlfriends."</p>
<p>Mrs French grinned as an idea came to mind.</p>
<p>"Excellent," she said. "Do you have dresses for the Homecoming Dance?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Show them to. I want you to look your best."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because this Faith just might throw her eye on you."</p>
<p>"Mom! We're not dykes," Anya protested.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. Just think of the presents, girls."</p>
<p>The girls looked at one another, thinking.</p>
<p>"Well, okay," Anya said. "I guess I can let her have her way with me. But the presents better be worth it."</p>
<p>Mrs French smiled.</p>
<p>"That's better. Now, let's see about your clothes." She frowned. "We may need to buy new ones."</p>
<p>"Really?" Cordelia said, excited.</p>
<p>"I want you two to look the best," Mrs French said.</p>
<p>"What about her?" Anya asked and nodded at Buffy, who was already busy cleaning up.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Mrs French expectantly.</p>
<p>"She's gonna stay at home," Mrs French said and Buffy's face fell. "I don't want you embarrassing your sisters."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and returned to cleaning, sad. She wanted so much to go to the Homecoming Dance, if only to see Faith.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>The next day, everyone at school was busy talking about the Homecoming Dance and Buffy felt really depressing. She wondered how it would be if someone had asked her to come, if her stepmother would then let her go. She didn't think so. Her stepmother had eyes only for her stepsisters and would never publicly admit that Buffy was also a part of the family. And it's not like she really was, she was more of a live-in servant than a family member.</p>
<p>When she came home, she had to cook and clean while her sisters tried on all the dresses they had already tried on the day before, apparently incapable of deciding which one to wear. Buffy wondered what it was like to have so many clothes that you were unable to decide what to wear.</p>
<p>As the night approached, Buffy was getting more and more depressed, but she hid it from her stepmother and her stepsisters, she didn't want them to punish her. She decided that unless her stepmother would give her something to do, she would use the time to study.</p>
<p>"Buffy, pay attention!"</p>
<p>Buffy jerked, startled.</p>
<p>"S-Sorry, M-Ma'am."</p>
<p>Mrs French shook her head, disgusted.</p>
<p>"Don't wait up for us, we'll be late. And since you'll have plenty of time, you can walk over to that gypsy Jenny and pay her what I owe her."</p>
<p>"B-But s-she l-lives on the o-other s-side of?"</p>
<p>"Is that a problem?" Mrs French asked glaring at her.</p>
<p>"N-No, M-Ma'am," Buffy stuttered, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Good." Mrs French counted the money, not wanting to part with it. "Here," she said and gave it to Buffy. "You better not lose it."</p>
<p>"Y-Yes, M-Ma'am," Buffy said and put the money away.</p>
<p>"Good. Now clean up and then scoot."</p>
<p>"Y-Yes, M-Ma'am."</p>
<p>Mrs French and her daughters left and Buffy sighed. A tear ran down her cheek and she wiped it. She looked around the mess of clothes and took a deep breath before starting to clean up.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After everything was clean, Buffy went to Jenny the gypsy. As she walked down the street, she noticed that a woman had stepped into a hole in the road and nearly fell. She also noticed the bus trying to stop before colliding with the woman. She ran to the woman and pulled her to safety just as the bus screeched past them.</p>
<p>"Whoa," the woman said as she sat up. "You okay?" she asked Buffy.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Hey, are you okay, Miss?" the buss driver called after he got out.</p>
<p>"We're fine, thank you," Hudson said and got up.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>The bus driver boarded the bus and drove away.</p>
<p>"Y-You're H-Hudson L-Leick," Buffy recognized the woman, surprised.</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes. You know me?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"You w-were Ca-Callisto on X-Xena."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I-I w-wanted to b-be j-just l-like h-her."</p>
<p>"Callisto?" Hudson asked, surprised, and Buffy nodded. "Why?"</p>
<p>"B-Bec-cause she' so s-strong."</p>
<p>Hudson frowned.</p>
<p>"She's not strong. She's scared and hurt and she lashes out at the world."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Thank you for saving my life."</p>
<p>"Y-You're w-welcome."</p>
<p>"Hey, maybe I can grant you a wish," Hudson said.</p>
<p>"A w-wish," Buffy said, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Yes, like a fairy god mother or something. I mean, if it's something that I can help you with."</p>
<p>"N-No, n-no, it's o-okay," Buffy said nervously.</p>
<p>"Oh come on, there must be something you want," Hudson said. "See, I told you there is," she said when she noticed that Buffy was thinking about something.</p>
<p>"I-I-I?"</p>
<p>"Yes?" Hudson encouraged her.</p>
<p>"I-I want t-to go to the H-Home-c-coming D-Dance."</p>
<p>"There, see? And why don't you?"</p>
<p>"I-I can't."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I-I have t-to pay my step-m-mother's d-debt."</p>
<p>"Debt?" Hudson said, puzzled, and Buffy nodded. "How much?"</p>
<p>"T-Twenty d-dollars."</p>
<p>"That's no problem. I can give you twenty dollars."</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head.</p>
<p>"N-No, I-I h-have the m-mon-ney."</p>
<p>Hudson frowned.</p>
<p>"Then what? Wait, is the dance tonight?" she asked and Buffy nodded. "And your mom sent you out to pay her debt instead of letting you go to the dance?" Buffy nodded again. "Bitch. Tell you what, I can take you to wherever you have to go and then you can go to the dance."</p>
<p>"N-No, I-I can't."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"I-I don't h-have a-anything to w-wear."</p>
<p>"That's no problem. After you pay the debt, we'll go shopping."</p>
<p>"N-No! I-I m-mean, y-you don't h-have to?"</p>
<p>"I want to," Hudson said.</p>
<p>"I-I still c-can g-go."</p>
<p>Hudson chuckled.</p>
<p>"And why not?"</p>
<p>"W-We're s-supposed to h-have an a-adult e-escort and m-my s-stepmother a-already t-took my s-step-s-sisters."</p>
<p>"I can go with you."</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"No! I-I m-mean?"</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"That's no problem," she said. "It's been a while since I've been to a Homecoming Dance. And besides, I know what it's like to be a klutz." She glanced at her watch. "But we'll have to leave at midnight. I have a flight half an hour later."</p>
<p>"B-But my s-step-m-mother for-bade me to g-go."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, by the time you're ready for the dance, she won't recognize you." She smiled. "Anyway, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"B-Buffy," Buffy said shyly.</p>
<p>Hudson lifted her chin and took a look at her face.</p>
<p>"Take your glasses off."</p>
<p>Buffy frowned.</p>
<p>"W-Why?"</p>
<p>"Humor me." Buffy took the glasses off and Hudson took a look at her face. "Yes, you're very pretty. Do you need those glasses?"</p>
<p>"N-No."</p>
<p>Hudson frowned.</p>
<p>"Then why are you wearing them?"</p>
<p>"M-My step-m-mother s-says I h-have t-to."</p>
<p>"Let me see them," Hudson said.</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment and then gave the glasses to Hudson, who looked through.</p>
<p>"This is just plain glass," she observed and Buffy nodded. "You know, your stepmother is definitely a bitch. Maybe I should have a talk with her."</p>
<p>"No!" Buffy said, scared, when she saw the faraway look in Hudson's eyes.</p>
<p>Hudson smiled sheepishly.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I was just channeling Callisto," she said and gave Buffy back her glasses. "Come let's go find ourselves a cab."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>An hour later, Buffy was ready. Mrs French's debt was paid, the clothes chosen and the makeup applied.</p>
<p>"Now, is she pretty or is she pretty?" Hudson said, satisfied, after giving Buffy a once over.</p>
<p>"She's definitely pretty," the owner of the shop agreed with a nod and Buffy blushed.</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go impress the crowds."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Well, here we are," Xander said when he and Faith arrived to the dance.</p>
<p>"Yeah." Faith said and looked at her mother. "Mom, we're gonna go dancing."</p>
<p>"Okay, honey." She glanced at Xander's parents. "And we'll go find ourselves a table."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>The parentals left and Faith took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Happy hunting," Xander said with a grin.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Thanks. But somehow I don't think there are many gay girls without dates around."</p>
<p>"The French sisters are apparently available."</p>
<p>Faith looked.</p>
<p>"They're straight."</p>
<p>"Then why are they looking at you like they want to devour you?"</p>
<p>"So is their mother. They just want the money."</p>
<p>Xander raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"And you can tell all that just by looking?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Here comes? Anya, I think."</p>
<p>Faith growled quietly.</p>
<p>"Hi, Faith," Anya said when she came closer. "Wanna dance?"</p>
<p>Faith put on a fake smile.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I already have a date for tonight," she said and went to the dance floor.</p>
<p>"But? But?" Anya said, puzzled.</p>
<p>"See?" Faith said. "Watch over my shoulder. She's gonna go back to her mom and complain. And when we stop dancing, her sister is probably gonna try her luck."</p>
<p>Xander grinned.</p>
<p>"Are you psychic now?"</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I wish I was. Let's dance."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>As they got out of the cab and approached the school, Buffy wasn't so sure anymore.</p>
<p>"A-Are y-you s-sure this is g-going to w-work?"</p>
<p>Hudson smiled at her.</p>
<p>"Positive. Now remember what I told you about walking. Straight, proud. Believe me, you are beautiful," she said and Buffy blushed. "And don't forget to breathe slowly, I don't want you to hyperventilate."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and followed Hudson inside. Heads turned and Buffy saw that people were not only admiring Hudson but also her. All the attention made her nervous.</p>
<p>"Relax," Hudson whispered. "Take a deep breath."</p>
<p>Buffy did so and she felt a bit better, but then she saw her stepmother and her stepsisters and she started hyperventilating.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Hudson asked.</p>
<p>"M-My step-m-mother."</p>
<p>Hudson wanted to look, but she decided not to, she didn't want to raise suspicions, in case the woman thought she recognized Buffy.</p>
<p>"Ignore her, she probably doesn't know you are you."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and looked away.</p>
<p>"Hey, you're Hudson Leick!" someone recognized Hudson.</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Cool."</p>
<p>"Hey, it's Hudson Leick!"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Callisto, you idiot."</p>
<p>Hudson groaned as people started to realize who she was.</p>
<p>"This is not good," she murmured under her breath.</p>
<p>"Can I have your autograph?"</p>
<p>"Can I have your autograph?"</p>
<p>More and more people started to surround her, asking for autographs.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Hey, that's Hudson Leick," Faith said when she saw the woman.</p>
<p>"Callisto?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I wonder what she's doing here."</p>
<p>"Probably not looking for fans," Xander commented when he noticed the crowd gathering.</p>
<p>"Oh great, just what she needs. I'll take care of it."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Buffy noticed Faith in the distance and her breath caught. Faith looked absolutely divine in her black dress. And then Faith started to approach and Buffy forgot to breathe.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Okay, give the lady some space!" Faith called and started pushing the students away. "This is a dance, not a convention for crying out loud," she said and people backed off. "Sorry," she told Hudson, "they can be such sheep sometimes."</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"So how?" Faith trailed off when she noticed Buffy. "Hi," she said and stared at her.</p>
<p>"H-Hi," Buffy said automatically.</p>
<p>Hudson smiled, recognizing love at first sight.</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss?"</p>
<p>Faith jerked and looked at her.</p>
<p>"Faith. The name's Faith."</p>
<p>"Faith. Why don't you keep my friend Buffy here company while I take care of the autographs, hmm?"</p>
<p>"N-No?" Buffy started to protest.</p>
<p>"Sure, no problem," Faith said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Do you want an autograph?" Hudson asked Faith.</p>
<p>"I already got one. I've been at the Valley Forge Convention."</p>
<p>"Oh. Well then, you two have fun," Hudson said with a smile, took Buffy's bag and went to the stage.</p>
<p>Faith looked at Buffy.</p>
<p>"Wanna dance?"</p>
<p>"I-I-I c-can't d-dance," she said nervously.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"That's no problem, it's easy. I can teach you."</p>
<p>Faith offered Buffy her hand and Buffy just stared at it for a few moments before she finally took it.</p>
<p>"Okay, people, listen up," Hudson said on the stage. "I know some of you recognized me and want my autograph. If you want one, line up at that table and you'll get it. But that's it, I'm here to have fun tonight." She smirked. "And I might be convinced to accept a dance. Thank you." She gave the microphone back to the singer. "Can you play something romantic?"</p>
<p>"Sure, no problem," the singer said.</p>
<p>Faith smiled when she recognized the song. She put her arms around Buffy and pressed her close. Buffy nearly passed out.</p>
<p>"Relax," Faith whispered.</p>
<p>"S-Sorry."</p>
<p>Faith smiled and caressed her.</p>
<p>"Nothing to be sorry about." She noticed Xander giving her a thumbs-up and she grinned. Then she looked back at Buffy. "Where are you from?"</p>
<p>"S-Sunny-d-dale."</p>
<p>"Really? I don't think I've seen around before."</p>
<p>"Y-You p-probably h-haven't."</p>
<p>"Oh. That's a shame," Faith said and Buffy blushed. "Would you, em, go out with me sometimes?"</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes went wide and she backed off a bit.</p>
<p>"A-As in o-on a d-date?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I-I-I d-don't kn-know. I-I?"</p>
<p>"Are you straight?"</p>
<p>"Eh, n-no. I-It's j-just that I-I-I've n-never b-been on a-a d-date bef-fore."</p>
<p>"Really?" Faith said, surprised.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So, would you like to go?"</p>
<p>Buffy frowned.</p>
<p>"Why w-would y-you go o-out with m-me?"</p>
<p>Faith raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Because I like you. You're gorgeous and I can see by the look in your eyes that you're interested in me, or my money."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"B-But I-I-I'm not r-rich."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"That's okay."</p>
<p>"A-And y-you don't ev-ven know m-me."</p>
<p>"That's why I want to go out with you, so I would get to know you better."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"So, is that a yes?"</p>
<p>Buffy was about to respond when the music changed into something more upbeat and she jerked. She looked around and saw people dancing to it.</p>
<p>"I-I can't d-dance to th-this," she said.</p>
<p>"Then let's go out."</p>
<p>"Out?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We can sit on one of the benches outside."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"O-Okay, b-but we sh-should t-tell H-Hudson."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>They went to the table where Hudson was just about finished signing the autographs. Hudson smiled at them when she noticed them.</p>
<p>"Having fun?" she asked and Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Definitely," Faith said. "We're going outside."</p>
<p>Hudson gave her a serious look.</p>
<p>"Behave."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"I will," she said seriously and then looked at Buffy. "Come on."</p>
<p>They went outside and Faith took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I haven't been this nervous since I first kissed a girl," she said and Buffy blushed. "Let's go to that bench."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and they slowly walked to the bench.</p>
<p>"Buffy," Faith said when they sat.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Nothing, I was just wondering at the name."</p>
<p>"M-My mother c-called me th-that."</p>
<p>"Oh. It suits you. It sounds soft and sweet, like you are."</p>
<p>Buffy blushed.</p>
<p>"R-Really?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled again and caressed Buffy.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. You know, this is probably the first time that I've wanted more from a girl than just her body," she said and Buffy's blush deepened. "I think I'm falling in love."</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"Re-Real-ly?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes," Faith said and caressed her again, having noticed that Buffy liked being caressed.</p>
<p>She leaned in for a kiss. Buffy was puzzled for a moment, but then her eyes went wide again when she realized what Faith wanted.</p>
<p>"I-I-I-I've n-never k-kissed b-bef-fore," she said, blushing.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"There's always a first time. Do you want me to kiss you?"</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Faith slowly leaned in, not wanting to pressure Buffy. Their lips slowly met. Faith wanted to use her tongue, but since Buffy didn't open her kiss, she didn't push.</p>
<p>"You like it?" she asked when she broke the kiss.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded, breathless.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes," she said and blushed.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Wanna do it again?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Okay. This time I want you to open your mouth a bit and use your tongue, okay?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded again.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes," she said, nervous and excited at the same time.</p>
<p>Faith slowly leaned in again and they kissed again. This time Buffy opened her lips and Faith pushed her tongue into Buffy's mouth. Buffy was a bit startled at first, but then she responded. The kiss lasted longer than the first one and when they stopped, Buffy had to take a few deep breaths to stop herself from hyperventilating.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Liked it?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes," she said and smiled shyly.</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Buffy hugged Faith, who was surprised by this.</p>
<p>"Oh F-Faith, th-this is the ha-happiest n-night of m-my l-life," Buffy said and a couple of tears slid down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Faith hugged her back.</p>
<p>"I think it just might be the happiest night of my life as well," she agreed.</p>
<p>"C-Can we j-just s-sit here f-for a wh-while?" Buffy asked when they stopped hugging.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"You bet," she said and wiped Buffy's tears.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled a little and then leaned her head on Faith's shoulder. Faith put her arm around Buffy's shoulder and leaned her head on Buffy's. Buffy then put her arm around Faith's waist and they sat like that for a while.</p>
<p>It was a new experience for Faith to just quietly sit with someone and enjoy her presence, but she liked it, a lot. Buffy wasn't the most bold girl, but there was something about her that Faith just couldn't pinpoint. And she liked that something, a lot. It was the first time she really liked a girl, and not just because she was gorgeous. She wanted to take this relationship slowly, she didn't want to screw it up.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After she was done signing the autographs, Hudson went out to check up on Buffy. When she saw her and Faith sitting next to one another, hugging, she smiled and returned inside, glad that the shy girl had found someone. She felt like a fairy godmother.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After an hour or so, Buffy and Faith went back inside. They danced some more and Buffy even started to enjoy the more upbeat music. She didn't dance to it, but she did move to the rhythm. Faith didn't mind standing next to her, holding her hand, even though she would usually be on the dance floor. She realized that for the first time she was afraid of losing someone and she didn't want that. So she stood beside Buffy and enjoyed her presence. And every time Buffy smiled at her, she felt butterflies in her stomach. It was weird, she never felt butterflies. She decided she liked the feeling.</p>
<p>Buffy was also in seventh heaven. This was the first time she was out, not just on a date but out in general. And to top it off, she just got herself Faith for a girlfriend, got her first kiss, and the second, and people were admiring her. Hell, people were jealous of her and she knew that her stepmother and stepsisters were angry for having failed at attracting Faith's attention. It was a dream come true.</p>
<p>As the midnight approached, Faith had to go to the toilette.</p>
<p>"Buffy."</p>
<p>"H-Hello," Buffy said and smiled at Hudson.</p>
<p>Hudson smiled back.</p>
<p>"Having a good time?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes."</p>
<p>"Good. Listen, I have to go now."</p>
<p>Buffy's face fell.</p>
<p>"A-Already?"</p>
<p>Hudson nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, I don't wanna miss my flight," she said and Buffy sighed. "You can stay if you want."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at her stepmother and then thought about going home alone through the neighborhood and she decided that it was not an option.</p>
<p>"N-No. C-Can w-we j-just wait f-for F-Faith?"</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Not for long. A minute tops."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and looked around, hoping that Faith would return soon.</p>
<p>But the minute passed and Faith still didn't return.</p>
<p>"Buffy, I really have to go now."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"J-Just let me tell X-Xander."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Buffy quickly went to Xander, who smiled at her.</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled back.</p>
<p>"Hi. L-Listen, I-I-I h-have to g-go n-now."</p>
<p>"Already?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes. H-Hudson has a f-flight."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"C-Can y-you t-tell Faith th-that I-I w-would l-like to see h-her a-again?"</p>
<p>Xander smiled.</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"Th-Thank y-you," Buffy said and hurried away.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>When Faith returned from the toilet, Buffy was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>"Faith."</p>
<p>Faith turned.</p>
<p>"Hey, X."</p>
<p>"She had to leave," Xander explained and Faith's face fell. "She said that Hudson had a flight."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"But she did say that she'd like to see you again."</p>
<p>Faith's face lit up.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Xander smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Alright! Awesome." She sighed, contended. "I think I'm gonna go home. I wanna dream of her and I don't want those French sluts to spoil my dreams."</p>
<p>Xander chuckled.</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll see you on Monday then."</p>
<p>"Yes. Night."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"This is where you live?" Hudson asked when the cab stopped and she saw that it was a seedy neighborhood.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Th-Thank y-you. Th-This w-was the b-best n-night of m-my life."</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"I'm glad I could help. And I have to admit it was kinda fun."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes. Em, g-good n-night."</p>
<p>"Good night, Buffy."</p>
<p>Buffy got out and they waved at each other as the cab drove away. Buffy took a deep breath and headed toward her home, thinking about Faith.</p>
<p>"Well, well, what have we here."</p>
<p>Buffy jerked, startled. She saw a group of young men leering at her and she knew she was in trouble.</p>
<p>"Aren't you a little young to be a hooker?"</p>
<p>"I-I'm n-not a?"</p>
<p>"How about you let us have some fun with you?"</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes went wide from fear.</p>
<p>"N-No, I-I?"</p>
<p>She screamed as two young men grabbed her. She struggled and one of them slapped her.</p>
<p>"Shut up, bitch."</p>
<p>The dress was torn and she lost a shoe.</p>
<p>"Let's take her to?"</p>
<p>"Cops!" one of the men shouted.</p>
<p>"Fuck!"</p>
<p>They let go of Buffy and ran away. Buffy crawled into the bushes, crying. She didn't want the cops to find her, because she knew her stepmother would beat her up if she found out she had gone to the dance.</p>
<p>When the police car passed by, Buffy got up and quickly limped home. There she undressed and showered. She felt dirty. The best night of her life had turned into probably the worst night. She cried for a few minutes, but then she remembered her stepmother. She quickly got out and dried herself. Then she cleaned up, stuffed the torn dress and the shoe into the bag Hudson had bought for her clothes and took them out. She threw the bag into the container two entrances away from hers. Then she went back home and cried herself to sleep.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"So, who is she?" Mrs Spencer asked as she and Faith drove home.</p>
<p>Faith smiled and she was surprised when she felt herself blushing.</p>
<p>"Buffy."</p>
<p>"You like her?"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah," Faith said dreamily. "I think I'm in love."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer chuckled.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. She? She's just? I don't know, I just wanna be with her, you know? I mean, sure, I'd love to sleep with her, but that's not the top priority, you know? We just sat on a bench outside and held one another and it was? I liked it."</p>
<p>"So she's the one?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes. I just can't wait to see her again."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>During the weekend, Mrs French and her daughters were in a bad mood, cursing the girl who had captured Faith's attention. Buffy was relieved that they had no idea that she was that girl. She stayed out of their way and thought about Faith.</p>
<p>Faith, on the other hand, was busy touring the clubs in order to try and find Buffy. She was unsuccessful, but that didn't dampen her mood. Buffy wanted to see her again and that probably meant that she would look her up in school. She wasn't sure if Buffy went to the same school or even what grade she was in, but she knew that Buffy knew where to find her. She realized she didn't know much about Buffy, but she was sure that would change soon.</p>
<p>So when Monday came, she went to school in a very good mood and every time she turned, she expected to see Buffy there.</p>
<p>Buffy, on the other hand, had to stay at home. Cordelia had intentionally splashed hot water into her face and Mrs French didn't want anyone at school asking questions. That, of course, didn't mean that Buffy was excused from her regular duties.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Three days later, Faith's mood was not so high anymore. Buffy was nowhere to be seen and Faith wondered if Buffy had just been playing with her. But then she remembered the look in Buffy's eyes and she knew that that was not so. She wondered where she was, realizing that for the first time she was really missing someone.</p>
<p>Buffy's face healed sufficiently by Wednesday and Mrs French allowed her to go back to school on Thursday. She searched for Faith but didn't see her till the lunch break. She wanted to approach her, but she was nervous, unsure if Faith would want to be with her now that she didn't look so pretty, or if she would even recognize her. When she finally gathered the courage to approach her, her stepsisters knocked her aside.</p>
<p>"Oops, sorry," Cordelia said, grinning.</p>
<p>"You French sluts are so pathetic," Faith said as she passed them.</p>
<p>Anya and Cordelia stared at her, huffing, and Buffy felt like crying. Although her last name was Summers and not French, she figured that Faith must have known who she was and that she didn't want her anymore. She felt like crying, but she knew her stepsisters would be mad at her if she embarrassed them in public. So she got up and quickly left before they remembered she existed.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"You okay, honey?" Mrs Spencer asked when she saw her daughter all depressed.</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"I miss Buffy."</p>
<p>"Still no sign from her?"</p>
<p>Faith shook her head.</p>
<p>"No. And I don't even know where to look. I mean, all I know is that she is from around here and that her name is Buffy. And that she knows Hudson Leick. I've been to every club in town, but nobody knows her. I even asked in school. It's like she doesn't exist. You did see her, didn't you?"</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes, I did."</p>
<p>"Good. For a moment there I thought I had imagined the whole thing."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer put her arm around Faith's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll find her, honey."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"You know, I've never been this scared before," Faith said quietly.</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer pressed her to herself and kissed her on the top of the head.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Honey, good news," Mrs Spencer said when Faith came home the next day.</p>
<p>"Yeah? I could really use some."</p>
<p>"Ms Leick called."</p>
<p>"She did?" Faith said, excitedly. "Yes. I called her agent and so on and she called me. I wrote down?"</p>
<p>"Let me see," Faith said and quickly pulled the piece of paper from her mother's hands. "She does go to the same school," she said, surprised. Then she frowned. "But how come I've never seen her before?"</p>
<p>"Maybe you never looked close enough."</p>
<p>Faith raised an eyebrow and looked back at the piece of paper.</p>
<p>"Is that all?"</p>
<p>"I called school then. Turn around."</p>
<p>Faith turned the piece of paper around and saw there was more information.</p>
<p>"She's in the same grade as I am. She's from the bad part of town."</p>
<p>"Does that bother you?"</p>
<p>Faith sighed and thought about it.</p>
<p>"No, not really. She did say that she wasn't rich."</p>
<p>"You think she wanted you for your money?"</p>
<p>Faith shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, I'm sure of it." She took a deep breath. "I'm gonna go visit her."</p>
<p>"Be careful, honey."</p>
<p>"I will, Mom."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>When Faith finally found the door, she knocked. She waited nervously for the door to open and when it did, she frowned, surprised.</p>
<p>"Mrs French?"</p>
<p>"Oh, hello, you must be Faith."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes."</p>
<p>"Come in, come in," Mrs French invited her kindly, but Faith could see the greed in her eyes. "Girls, Faith is here!"</p>
<p>"Ah, actually, I was looking for, em, Buffy," Faith said, not really looking forward to meeting the French sluts.</p>
<p>Mrs French frowned.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Buffy who?"</p>
<p>"Em, Summers?"</p>
<p>"There is no Buffy Summers here."</p>
<p>"Oh," Faith said, disappointed. "Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Positive."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Okay. Bye," she said and left, disappointed.</p>
<p>"Mom?" Cordelia asked. "Where is she?" she asked when she got to the door.</p>
<p>"She left."</p>
<p>"Left? Why?"</p>
<p>"Did you say Faith was here?" Anya asked as she arrived a few moments after Cordelia.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Where is she?"</p>
<p>"She left."</p>
<p>Anya frowned.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"How should I know?!" Mrs French said, annoyed.</p>
<p>"What did she want?"</p>
<p>"Buffy."</p>
<p>"Buffy! What the hell did she want with her?"</p>
<p>"How should I know? I told her that we didn't know any Buffy. Got it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mom."</p>
<p>"Where is that slut, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I sent her out," Cordelia said.</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Downstairs, Faith got into her car and sighed, disappointed. Either the information her mother got was wrong or Mrs French was lying. But she did see her with only two daughters, so? She was confused. She decided to stake out the place on Monday, just in case, and then ask in school. She was just about to start the car when she noticed a fancy shoe. It was familiar somehow and it definitely didn't belong in a seedy neighborhood like this. She got out and picked it up. It looked like Buffy's. She decided to take it with her, in case Buffy had lost it.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"C-Cordelia, I-I?"</p>
<p>She trailed off as Cordelia slapped her.</p>
<p>"What does Faith Spencer want with you?" she demanded and grabbed the package from Buffy.</p>
<p>"Wh-What?" Buffy asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Did you embarrass us somehow?" Anya asked.</p>
<p>"Of course she did," Cordelia said. "Remember yesterday?"</p>
<p>Anya thought.</p>
<p>"That's right! She thought you were our sister," she said and slapped Buffy again. "How could she? I mean, look at you."</p>
<p>"She thought she was your sister?" Mrs French asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mom."</p>
<p>Mrs French glared at Buffy.</p>
<p>"Did you blabber around again?"</p>
<p>"N-No, Ma'am," Buffy said, scared.</p>
<p>"Then how could she possibly mistake you for our sister?" Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>"I-I d-don't kn-know."</p>
<p>"You slut."</p>
<p>"Go clean the toilet," Mrs French said.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes, M-Ma'am," Buffy said and quickly scurried away before she got slapped again.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Did you? You didn't find her," Mrs Spencer said when she saw Faith's face.</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"No. I found the French sluts there. Their mom said she doesn't know any Buffy. Are you sure that was the correct address?"</p>
<p>"That's what the secretary said."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"This sucks," she said and went to her room to mope.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>On Monday morning, Faith got up early and drove to where Buffy was supposed to live. She waited for a while and saw Mrs French drive her daughters to school. She waited a while longer, but there was no sign of Buffy. Of course, she couldn't have known that Anya had whacked Buffy on the hand with a hammer and Mrs French then told her to take care of the wound herself. Faith sighed and drove off.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Hey, Faith," Xander said when he saw her in school.</p>
<p>"Hey," Faith said with a smile that didn't reach her eyes.</p>
<p>"Still no luck?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Damn, now I'm getting worried."</p>
<p>"I'll go ask the secretary later if the address is correct."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After the first period, Faith first had to go to the library to get some books. Buffy was just leaving with a pile of books when Faith entered and hit her.</p>
<p>"Watch it," Faith said, annoyed, not really paying attention. "Damn."</p>
<p>"S-Sorry," Buffy muttered as she reached for the glasses.</p>
<p>Faith turned, surprised.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" she asked, but Buffy was too busy holding back the tears, thinking Faith didn't like her anymore.</p>
<p>When Buffy didn't respond, Faith shook her head and when she saw her pick up the glasses with a bandaged hand, she decided that it wasn't Buffy. She sighed and went to the counter.</p>
<p>"Watch the books!" the librarian shouted at Buffy.</p>
<p>"It was my fault," Faith told him as she watched Buffy pick up her books and leave.</p>
<p>"Whatever," the librarian said, not really caring. "What do you need?"</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After she got her books, Faith went to the secretary.</p>
<p>"Mrs Walsh."</p>
<p>"Hello, Faith."</p>
<p>"Em, you gave my mom an address on Friday."</p>
<p>"Buffy Summers?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I went to see her, but she doesn't live there."</p>
<p>Mrs Walsh frowned.</p>
<p>"Of course she does. Hold on a moment." She fetched a folder and looked in. "Yes, it was the correct address."</p>
<p>"But I went there and Mrs French said she didn't know any Buffy."</p>
<p>"Mrs French? She is Buffy's stepmother."</p>
<p>"Really?" Faith said, surprised. She frowned. "Then why did she say she didn't know her?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"I'll go there again. Thanks."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"What did you find out?" Xander asked her when he ran across her in the hall.</p>
<p>"That bitch lied."</p>
<p>"Which bitch?"</p>
<p>"Mrs French. She said she didn't know Buffy."</p>
<p>Xander frowned.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but I'm gonna find out."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>In the afternoon, Faith went to see Mrs French again, but there was no one at home.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Ah, Faith!" Mrs Walsh called when she saw Faith walking down the hall the next morning.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs Walsh?"</p>
<p>"You were looking for Buffy."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"She's in the hospital."</p>
<p>"What?" Faith said, worried sick. "Why? What happened?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure. Mrs French called and told me."</p>
<p>"Oh. Thanks."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After school, Faith went straight to the hospital.</p>
<p>"I'm looking for Buffy Summers."</p>
<p>"Are you family?" the nurse asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Faith said without hesitation.</p>
<p>The nurse checked the list.</p>
<p>"Room 302."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Faith said and hurried off.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>It took her a while to locate the room, but she finally did. She took a deep breath, nervous, and then entered. Buffy was still unconscious and she looked so fragile. Faith stared at her for a few moments, realizing that she looked familiar. She looked around and noticed the glasses. She frowned. She looked back at Buffy and noticed that her hand was bandaged. Then her eyes went wide as she suddenly realized that she knew her, that she had bumped into her the day before and that she had probably seen her every day. She felt bad that she had never noticed Buffy, that it took a dance and a celebrity for her to notice her. She wondered why Buffy never approached her. She sighed and grabbed a chair. Then she took Buffy's hand and sat down.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Faith, where have you been?" Mrs Spencer asked when Faith came home in the evening.</p>
<p>"In the hospital."</p>
<p>"In the hospital?" Mrs Spencer asked, worried. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Buffy was there."</p>
<p>"You found her?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"I probably saw her every day."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer frowned.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"She's one of the shy, mousy people I usually ignore. I mean, I bumped into her yesterday. And she said she was sorry, but when I said her name, she didn't respond." She sighed. "I'm confused, Mom. Has she been ignoring me on purpose?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, honey, you'll have to ask her."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"I will. I'll go visit her tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Faith!" Xander called when he saw his friend.</p>
<p>"Hey, X," Faith said with a smile.</p>
<p>"You found her?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Is it that obvious?"</p>
<p>Xander grinned.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. She's in the hospital."</p>
<p>"In the hospital? Why?"</p>
<p>Faith shrugged.</p>
<p>"I don't know, the doctor said something about a kidney surgery."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"And guess what, I've probably seen her every day! Can you imagine? I feel like a such a moron."</p>
<p>Xander frowned.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, she's one of those shy nerds I usually ignore. I mean, I ignore just about everyone, but I never really looked at any of them. And I bumped into her two days ago in the library!"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." She sighed. "I'm a fucking idiot. I mean, here she is, the girl of my life, right under my nose and I never noticed her! Shit."</p>
<p>"Calm down, Faith, you found her."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. I'm gonna go see her in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>When Buffy woke up, she was a bit disoriented, but the memories soon came back and she started to cry. Her life sucked. Not only was she a slave to her stepmother and her stepsisters, but the best night of her life had turned into a nightmare, the girl she loved had used her and now she was just a sack of spare human organs. That was the last straw.</p>
<p>She lay for a while, gathering her strength. Then she slowly got up and tried to open the window. She couldn't due to the fact that the hospital was air conditioned and the windows didn?t open. So she took a chair and smashed the window with it. Then she dropped the chair and tried to climb through the window, but the noise attracted a nurse's attention and she stopped Buffy.</p>
<p>"L-Let m-me g-go!" Buffy demanded, crying, as the nurse pulled her back.</p>
<p>"Suicide is no solution, honey," the nurse said as she held her. Then she noticed the blood on the window. "Oh my god," she said and looked at Buffy. She noticed the blood on her as well. "Come on, let's get you back to bed."</p>
<p>"N-N-, I-I d-don't wa-want?"</p>
<p>"Shhh, calm down."</p>
<p>The nurse picked up Buffy and laid her on the bed. Then she pressed then call button and another nurse arrived.</p>
<p>"Yes, what? What happened?" she asked, surprised, when she saw the smashed window.</p>
<p>"Get Doctor Giles."</p>
<p>The second nurse noticed the blood.</p>
<p>"Right away," she said and hurried away.</p>
<p>Buffy then passed out and the nurse that saved her relaxed. </p>

<hr></hr>

<p>After school, Faith went straight to the hospital. She entered Buffy's room and stopped cold when she saw the smashed window and no Buffy.</p>
<p>"No," she said, terrified. She ran to the information counter. "The patient in to 302, what happened to her? Where is she?"</p>
<p>"Are you family?"</p>
<p>"Of course I'm family," Faith said, annoyed. "Where is she? What happened?"</p>
<p>The nurse looked at the records.</p>
<p>"She tried to kill herself."</p>
<p>"What?" Faith said, her face pale. "And? And?"</p>
<p>"The nurses stopped her," the nurse said and Faith relaxed.</p>
<p>"Thank god."</p>
<p>"She was moved to 306."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Faith said and hurried to 306.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and entered. Buffy was lying as before and Faith relaxed a bit when she saw that Buffy was still alive. She approached the bed, grabbed a chair and sat down.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Miss," a nurse said and Faith jerked.</p>
<p>She looked around and saw it was evening already.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Visiting hours are over."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Can I stay?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not. You can wait in the waiting room."</p>
<p>Faith nodded and got up.</p>
<p>"When will she wake up?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow. She's been sedated."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because she was upset. She had tried to kill herself and then the police came."</p>
<p>"The cops? Why?" Faith asked, worried.</p>
<p>"I don't know, something about her kidney."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"I believe she is scheduled for a surgery tomorrow."</p>
<p>"What surgery?"</p>
<p>"Kidney."</p>
<p>"Oh," Faith said and sighed. "Okay, thanks."</p>
<p>The nurse smiled and Faith went out. She took her cell phone and called her mom.</p>
<p><i>"Faith?"</i></p>
<p>"Yes, Mom. I'm gonna stay in the hospital overnight."</p>
<p><i>"Why?"</i></p>
<p>"Buffy tried to kill herself."</p>
<p><i>"What?"</i> Mrs Spencer said, worried. <i>"Why?"</i></p>
<p>"I don't know, Mom. I'd like to stay here until she wakes up, so if you could excuse me from school."</p>
<p><i>"Of course, honey."</i></p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom. I'll call you tomorrow."</p>
<p><i>"Okay, honey. Good night."</i></p>
<p>"Night, Mom."</p>
<p>Faith hung up and found herself a comfortable chair. She tried to get some sleep, but she was worried about Buffy and it took her a while to finally fall asleep.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>She woke up in the middle of the night and went to the toilet. Then she returned to the chair. She sat there for a while and then, as the nurse had to go somewhere, got up and sneaked into Buffy's room. She sat in the chair, took Buffy's hand and used the bed as a pillow.</p>
<p>When the nurse came back and saw that Faith was gone, she thought that Faith had left, but then realized that that was not very likely. So she went to Buffy's room a looked inside. She saw Faith sleeping with her head on the bed and she decided not to wake her up. She smiled and returned to her desk.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>When Buffy woke up in the morning, she felt that someone was holding her hand. She looked and was surprised to see Faith. She jerked, startled, and Faith woke up.</p>
<p>Faith was a bit disoriented at first, but then she remembered where she was. She looked at Buffy and smiled when she saw she was awake.</p>
<p>"You're awake!" she said and wanted to hug her, but Buffy backed off. Faith frowned, puzzled. "What's wrong?" she asked, worried, but Buffy didn't respond. She sighed. "I've been looking all over for you, my mom even called Hudson Leick. I mean? And then I came here and saw those glasses of yours and I realized I've probably been seeing you every day. Shit, I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't you say anything? I mean, I bumped into you and when I heard you stutter, I thought it was you, but you didn't respond and I saw the glasses and so I thought it wasn't you. And why did your stepmom lie to me? I mean, I came to your place and she said she didn't know you. Hell, I didn't even know the French sluts were your stepsisters." She sighed. "And what happened to your kidney? And why did you try to kill yourself? And why were the cops here?" She realized she was crying and she wiped her tears. "What's going on, Buffy?"</p>
<p>Buffy stared at Faith babble. She was surprised. She had thought that Faith didn't care about her, but apparently she did.</p>
<p>"D-Do y-you s-stil ca-care ab-bout me?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"Of course I do. I was going crazy when you didn't show up. I thought you were only playing with me."</p>
<p>"I-I w-would ne-nev-ver play with y-you."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Good." Then her face became serious. "Why didn't you come to me, Buffy?"</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and looked away, a tear sliding down her cheek. Faith reached over and wiped it, causing Buffy to jerk, startled. Buffy stared at her for a few moments and then took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I-I w-want-ted to, b-but my s-step-sisters p-pushed me a-and th-then y-you c-came a-along and called th-them s-sluts and I-I thought y-you knew I-I was th-their s-stepsisters a-and you m-meant me as w-well."</p>
<p>"I didn't," Faith assured her. "I didn't even see you. I mean, I saw you, but I didn't recognize you."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"I-I know." She took a deep breath to calm herself. "I-I th-thought y-you didn't l-like m-me."</p>
<p>"Wait, that was on Thursday," Faith suddenly realized. "What about Monday to Wednesday?"</p>
<p>Buffy gulped and looked away, nervous.</p>
<p>"C-Cordelia sp-splashed h-hot w-water in m-my f-face and my s-stepmo-mother said I sh-should s-stay a-at h-home."</p>
<p>"That bitch," Faith said between her teeth. She sighed. "Go on."</p>
<p>"I-I wa-wasn't h-home we-when y-you ca-came, but my step-m-mother was a-angry w-with me, she th-thought that I-I had emb-barrassed her d-daughters."</p>
<p>"And on Monday? I was there in the morning because I had a feeling that she was lying. I saw her take her sluts to school, but you were nowhere to be seen."</p>
<p>Buffy gulped and another tear ran down her cheek.</p>
<p>"A-Anya hit me w-with a h-ham-mer a-and my s-stepmother to-told me to t-take ca-care of the w-wound," Buffy said and showed her the bandaged hand. "I-I was l-late."</p>
<p>"Oh." Faith thought for a moment. "And why didn't you respond when I called your name? In the library, after we crashed."</p>
<p>"B-Bec-cause y-you to-told me to w-watch it a-and I th-thought y-you didn't l-like me anym-more."</p>
<p>"Oh Buffy, I'm so sorry," Faith said, her face serious. "And why are you here?"</p>
<p>Buffy started to sob and Faith quickly hugged her.</p>
<p>"Hey, shhh, it's okay, I'm here."</p>
<p>Buffy hugged her back and cried for a while. Faith found herself crying as well.</p>
<p>Buffy calmed after a few minutes and then let go of Faith.</p>
<p>"You don't have to tell me if it's too painful," Faith said.</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head.</p>
<p>"I-I w-want to."</p>
<p>"Only if you're sure about it."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"M-My step-mother s-sold m-my kid-ney f-for mon-ney."</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"What do you? Wait, she had some illegal surgeon take your kidney and pay her for it?" she guessed and Buffy nodded. "That bitch!" Faith said, furious. "If I get my hands on her, she's gonna wish the surgeon had taken her kidney. Ooh?" She took a deep breath to calm down. "Is that why you tried to kill yourself?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes," she said and a tear slid down her cheeks, which Faith wiped.</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"And the cops? I heard they were here."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Th-They caught the s-surgeon a-and they f-found my k-kidney."</p>
<p>"Really? That's good news. Is that why you're waiting for the surgery?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"That's good."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded again.</p>
<p>"M-My step-m-other and m-my s-stepsisters have b-been ar-rested."</p>
<p>"Good. Bitches."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a few moments, nervous.</p>
<p>"F-Faith?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>Buffy gulped.</p>
<p>"D-Do you s-stil want to b-be with m-me?"</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"Of course I do. That is if you still want to be with me."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>"I-I do."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Good." Then she frowned. "Wait! You live in that dump. How come you know Hudson Leick? I mean, I'm pretty sure she doesn't hang around your neighborhood."</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head.</p>
<p>"N-No. I-I was j-just o-on my w-way to p-pay m-my step-mother's de-debt wh-when I-I saw a-a wo-woman step in-into a-a hole in the r-road. Th-There was a b-bus com-ming and I-I ran to h-help her. I-I didn't kn-know it was h-her."</p>
<p>"Oh. So you saved her life?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes."</p>
<p>"Cool," Faith said and Buffy smiled a little. "And how did you end up going to the dance with her?"</p>
<p>"Sh-She wa-wanted to d-do somth-thing to rep-pay me a-and I said I-I wanted to g-go to the d-dance. So sh-she b-bought me cl-lothes a-and ma-make-up and went with m-me."</p>
<p>"Wow," Faith said and smiled. "You know, you should put that dress on more? Wait, did you lose a shoe? Because I found one that looked just like? What's wrong?" she asked, worried, when she saw that Buffy was on the verge of tears. "Buffy? Talk to me."</p>
<p>Buffy tried to calm down.</p>
<p>"A-After she drop-ped me near m-my block, I-I was n-nearly? r-raped."</p>
<p>"What?" Faith said, her face pale.</p>
<p>"I-I wa-wasn't. They ran aw-way wh-when the co-cops came b-by."</p>
<p>"Oh Buffy," Faith said and a few tears slid down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Buffy slowly reached up and wiped them, moved that someone was crying over her. Faith captured her hand and kissed her palm.</p>
<p>"The d-dres was t-torn, so I-I threw it aw-way. A-And I did l-lose a-a shoe."</p>
<p>They were quiet for a while.</p>
<p>"I won't let anyone hurt you again," Faith then promised quietly.</p>
<p>"F-Faith?"</p>
<p>"I mean it, Buffy. You've been through enough shit already," Faith said and caressed her.</p>
<p>Then the nurse came in.</p>
<p>"Ah, you're awake. Good." She came closer. "How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"B-Better," Buffy said and smiled a little.</p>
<p>"Good. Doctor Giles will come around soon and then you will be prepped for surgery." She looked at Faith. "I'm afraid you will have to leave then."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>The nurse nodded and left.</p>
<p>"I-I'm s-scared," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Why? The surgery?" Faith asked and Buffy nodded. "Don't worry, it'll be over soon. And I'll be here when you wake up. I'll just go home to change and get something to eat."</p>
<p>"A-Aren't you g-going to s-school?"</p>
<p>"No. I told Mom to excuse me so I could be with you."</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy said and blushed a bit, causing Faith to smile.</p>
<p>"You're cute when you blush," she said and Buffy blushed even more. Then she sighed and her face became serious. "I'm sorry for not noticing you."</p>
<p>Buffy's face also became serious.</p>
<p>"It's o-okay," she said and gently squeezed Faith's hand.</p>
<p>Faith smiled a little.</p>
<p>"Thanks. I just feel so stupid," she said and shook her head. "I mean, you were right under my nose and I never noticed you. Shit.</p>
<p>"It's o-okay, F-Faith," Buffy repeated and gently squeezed Faith's hand again.</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Well, at least we're together now," she said and caressed Buffy, who smiled. "I'll make sure you get all the notes for the classes you've missed."</p>
<p>"Th-Thank y-you."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"That's what girlfriends are for," she said and Buffy blushed again.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door and then Doctor Giles entered.</p>
<p>"Hello, girls," he said.</p>
<p>"Hey, Doc," Faith said.</p>
<p>"How do you feel, Buffy?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"B-Better."</p>
<p>"Ready for the surgery?" he asked and Buffy nodded. "Okay then." He looked at Faith. "You'll have to leave now."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know," she said and got up.</p>
<p>She leaned over and kissed Buffy on the lips. Buffy was surprised at first, but then she responded. The doctor merely turned away, blushing, giving them some privacy. When they were done kissing, Faith looked into Buffy's eyes.</p>
<p>"I love you, Buffy," she said and caressed her. "I'll be here when you wake up." Then she looked at Doctor Giles. "Doc, take good care of her."</p>
<p>Doctor Giles nodded.</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Faith blew Buffy a kiss and left. Buffy stared after her until she disappeared. She was still stunned by Faith's declaration. No one had ever loved her before, except her mom and dad, but they were long gone. And now the most wonderful girl in the world loved her. A tear slid down her cheek and she quickly wiped it, blushing, when she noticed that the doctor was looking at her.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Mom?!" Faith called when she came home.</p>
<p>"Here!" Mrs Spencer called from the kitchen and Faith went there. "Hey, honey."</p>
<p>"Oh Mom," Faith said and hugged her.</p>
<p>She started to sob and Mrs Spencer consoled her.</p>
<p>"Shh, it's okay, honey. What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Faith let go of her mother and wiped her tears.</p>
<p>"Nothing and everything. Buffy's being prepped for the surgery."</p>
<p>"Surgery? Is something wrong?" Mrs Spencer asked, worried.</p>
<p>"No, no, it's okay." She frowned. "Actually, it's not okay. Do you know what that bitch of a stepmother of hers did? She sold Buffy's kidney."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer frowned.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, sold?"</p>
<p>"She got some illegal surgeon to remove Buffy's kidney for money."</p>
<p>"What?!" Mrs Spencer said, upset. "Does the police know?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. They got the surgeon and the kidney and they arrested Mrs French. And apparently her daughters too. Anyway, Buffy is getting her kidney back."</p>
<p>"Oh," Mrs Spencer said, relieved. "Good." Then she frowned. "Wait, you said she wanted to kill herself."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Yeah. We talked and she told me more about herself. Her stepmom and her stepsisters were using her as a live-in maid and they abused her. And she was nearly raped after the Homecoming Dance."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"She wasn't, the rapists ran away when the cops came by. Anyway, she also thought I didn't care for her anymore and then that kidney stuff, it broke her and she just wanted to end it."</p>
<p>"My god."</p>
<p>"Can she move in with us, Mom? I've been to her place and it sucks."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Not to mention that she'll need a lot of attention when she gets from the hospital."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And her? What?" she said when she finally comprehended what her mother was saying.</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer smiled.</p>
<p>"I said yes."</p>
<p>"Oh Mom," Faith said and hugged her. "Thanks."</p>
<p>"You're welcome, honey. Oh, by the way, Hudson Leick called."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Faith said and let go of her mother.</p>
<p>"Yes. She wanted to know how you two were doing."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"You're not going to school, are you? I've already called the secretary."</p>
<p>"No, no, I just came to change and grab something to eat. I wanna be there when she wakes up."</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll make you something and then I'll prepare a room for Buffy."</p>
<p>"Okay. Thanks, Mom," Faith said and hugged her. "I love you."</p>
<p>"I love you too, honey," Mrs Spencer said, moved.</p>
<p>Faith then let go of her and ran upstairs and Mrs Spencer stared after her, trying not to cry. She had a wonderful daughter who was happy. What more could a mother want?</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>There was a soft knock.</p>
<p>"Faith?"</p>
<p>Faith jerked and looked at the owner of the voice.</p>
<p>"Ms Leick?" she said, surprised.</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes. Call me Hudson."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Hudson looked at Buffy.</p>
<p>"I came as soon as I could. How is she?"</p>
<p>Faith looked at Buffy.</p>
<p>"She's fine now. She got her kidney back."</p>
<p>"Kidney?" Hudson said, worried.</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"It's a long story. How come you're here?"</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"I like Buffy and she's a friend. And besides, when your mom said she was in hospital and she didn't know why, I got worried."</p>
<p>"Oh. Then sit down and I'll tell you."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>When Buffy finally woke up, her body still hurt from the surgery.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" she heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>She slowly opened her eyes and smiled when she saw Faith.</p>
<p>"Hey," Faith said. "How do you fell? Are you in pain?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to call a doctor?"</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head.</p>
<p>"I-It's not th-that b-bad."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" Faith asked again and Buffy nodded. "Okay." She glanced at Hudson. "Look who's here."</p>
<p>Buffy turned her head and her eyes went wide when she saw Hudson.</p>
<p>"Hi," Hudson said.</p>
<p>"H-Hi," Buffy said. "Wh-What a-are you d-doing h-here?"</p>
<p>"I heard you were in the hospital and I came to see you."</p>
<p>"Re-ally?"</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Wh-Why? I-I m-mean, I-I b-barely know y-you."</p>
<p>"Well, you did save my life. And besides, I like you and I consider you my friend."</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes went wide again.</p>
<p>"R-Really?"</p>
<p>Hudson nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"W-Wow."</p>
<p>Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I'm gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. Faith has told me what's going on and I have no doubt that she'll take good care of you." She looked at Faith, channeling Callisto. "Or else."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Don't worry."</p>
<p>"Good." She looked back at Buffy. "You get well fast. And if you two have a wedding of some sort, I want to be on the guest list."</p>
<p>"You bet," Faith said.</p>
<p>"Y-You c-could g-give me a-away," Buffy suggested, blushing, and Hudson smiled.</p>
<p>"I'd love that," she said and got up. She looked at her watch. "I better see if I still have the part," she murmured and looked back at Faith and Buffy. "Take care, girls."</p>
<p>"You too, Hudson," Faith said.</p>
<p>"And tell your mother I said hi."</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>"B-Bye," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Bye," Hudson said with a smile and left.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you know," Faith said when Hudson was gone, "we got ourselves a celebrity friend."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes." She hesitated for a moment. "F-Faith?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>Buffy took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I love you."</p>
<p>Faith flashed a big smile.</p>
<p>"Oh Buffy," she said and hugged her. "Hey, you didn't stutter," she said, surprised, and let go of her.</p>
<p>Buffy blushed a bit, nervous.</p>
<p>"I-I kn-know."</p>
<p>"Can you control it?"</p>
<p>"N-No, I-I-I?"</p>
<p>"It's okay, Buffy," Faith quickly assured her. "We'll work on it, okay?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"O-Okay."</p>
<p>Faith smiled and caressed her.</p>
<p>"Good. Oh, I talked to Mom and she said you can move in with us when they release you."</p>
<p>"W-What?" Buffy said, surprised. "B-But I-I-I c-can't. I-I m-mean, I-I don't w-want t-to m-make y-you thin-nk tha-that I-I'm o-only wi-with you b-because o-of mon-ney."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"I know you're not, Buffy. And besides, you're gonna need someone to take care of you when they release you. And I don't want to risk your stepmom trying something. Don't worry, I didn't even have to convince Mom, she immediately agreed."</p>
<p>"R-Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I think she likes you."</p>
<p>Buffy frowned.</p>
<p>"B-But we ha-haven't m-met yet."</p>
<p>"I think she saw you at the dance."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"And she knows I love you, so?"</p>
<p>Buffy blushed at that and Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Listen, I'll leave a bit early today so I can go through Xander's notes. I'm going to school tomorrow. I'll come after lunch and bring you my notes so you won't fall behind."</p>
<p>"Th-Thank y-you."</p>
<p>"No problem. And you won't ever have to do the dishes again or clean anything."</p>
<p>Buffy frowned.</p>
<p>"B-But wh-what will I-I d-do i-in my f-free time?"</p>
<p>Faith chuckled.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I can find something for you to do, something fun. I mean, you can clean and do the dishes if you want, but you don't have to. Well, we have the dishwasher for the dishes, so that's taken care of. And Mom's office is very near, so she usually does the cooking. She likes to cook. And the maids usually clean up and the gardener takes care of the garden."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it's about time you started having some fun. And the first fun is shopping."</p>
<p>Buffy raised an eyebrow, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Sh-Shop-ping is f-fun?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, you'll see. First, we need to get you some decent clothes and cosmetics."</p>
<p>"B-But?"</p>
<p>"No buts. I wanna spoil you. And don't worry, I know you're not with me because of my money."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled a bit, not quite sure about Faith spoiling her.</p>
<p>"O-Okay."</p>
<p>Faith smiled back.</p>
<p>"Now rest, I want you out of here as soon as possible," she said and gently squeezed Buffy's hand.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and closed her eyes. Faith leaned back in the chair and quietly observed her, feeling like the happiest girl alive.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Several hours later, a knock on the door startled them both.</p>
<p>"Hello, girls."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Hi, Mom."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Faith, slightly nervous.</p>
<p>"M-Mom?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes." She looked at her mother. "Mom, this is Buffy. Buffy, Mom."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer smiled.</p>
<p>"Hello," she said and grabbed a chair.</p>
<p>"H-Hi," Buffy said nervously.</p>
<p>"How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"I-It hurts a b-bit."</p>
<p>"Oh." She looked at Faith. "Did you tell her about moving in with us?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Good. I prepared the room next to yours."</p>
<p>"Okay. Thanks. Oh, Hudson says hi."</p>
<p>"Really? She was here?" Mrs Spencer asked, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh. Thank you."</p>
<p>"She's gonna give Buffy away if we have some sort of wedding," Faith said and Buffy blushed.</p>
<p>"Really?" Mrs Spencer said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes. She's one cool woman."</p>
<p>"Yes, you could say that," Mrs Spencer agreed, nodding. "Oh, Xander brought you his notes."</p>
<p>"I thought he might. I'll leave early today so I can go over them."</p>
<p>"Okay, honey." Then her beeper went off and she looked at it annoyed. "Damn. I have to go." She looked at Buffy. "You get well soon."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and Mrs Spencer got up.</p>
<p>"M-Mrs S-Spencer?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Th-Thank y-you."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer smiled.</p>
<p>"You're welcome, honey."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer left and Buffy looked at Faith.</p>
<p>"Sh-She likes m-me?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, she likes you."</p>
<p>"A-And she d-doesn't m-mind th-that y-you and I-I are tog-gether? I-I mean, em, y-you kn-know, a-as lesb-bians?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"No. She knows I'm gay and you're not exactly my first girlfriend."</p>
<p>"I-I'm not?"</p>
<p>"No. I've had? three before, but it didn't work out, none of them made me feel the way you do."</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy said and blushed.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"And I've also slept with other girls. Just so you know," she added nervously, causing Buffy's blush to deepen.</p>
<p>"O-Okay," Buffy said.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Rest now."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded and closed her eyes again.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"Xander!" Faith called her friend when she saw him in school the next day.</p>
<p>Xander turned.</p>
<p>"Faith!" He came closer. "How's it going?"</p>
<p>"Great! Thanks for the notes."</p>
<p>"No problem. How's Buffy?"</p>
<p>"She's recovering. She should be released in a few days."</p>
<p>"That's good."</p>
<p>"Yeah. And guess what, she's moving in with me."</p>
<p>"Really? Cool."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Oh, hey, did you hear? I've heard that the French sluts have been arrested."</p>
<p>Faith's face became serious.</p>
<p>"They were."</p>
<p>"Really? Why?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, probably for questioning. Their mom sold Buffy's kidney and the cops arrested her."</p>
<p>Xander frowned, puzzled.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, sold?"</p>
<p>"Hired some illegal surgeon to get it out."</p>
<p>"What? Is she fucking crazy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, she is. Bitch." She took a deep breath. "Anyway, Buffy got her kidney back."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, they caught the surgeon."</p>
<p>"That's good."</p>
<p>"Yeah." She sighed. "I just can't wait till she gets out."</p>
<p>Xander smiled.</p>
<p>"You want to get down and dirty?"</p>
<p>Faith was annoyed that she blushed.</p>
<p>"Believe it or not, no. I wanna take it slow, you know? I don't wanna freak her out or anything. And I'm not really in a hurry, I want her to be ready and I want our first time to be special."</p>
<p>Xander smiled.</p>
<p>"My, Faith's in love."</p>
<p>Faith stuck out her tongue at him and Xander smiled.</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go to class."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Finally the big day came. Mrs Spencer took care of the paperwork and Faith helped Buffy get dressed.</p>
<p>"I hope these fit you. We're about the same size, so?" she said and showed Buffy the clothes she had brought her. "I also brought you panties and a bra."</p>
<p>"Th-Thank you."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"No problem. I'll help you get dressed.</p>
<p>"O-Okay. Em, what ab-bout these?" Buffy asked and held up the panties and the bra.</p>
<p>"Oh," Faith said and found herself blushing. "I'll turn away. Okay?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Faith turned around and couldn't help but get slightly aroused at the sounds of Buffy putting on her underwear.</p>
<p>"Are you okay? Can you manage?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Y-Yes," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Buffy first put on the panties and then the bra.</p>
<p>"C-Can y-you c-clasp on the b-bra, p-please?"</p>
<p>"Sure," Faith said. "Are you decent?"</p>
<p>"Y-Yes."</p>
<p>Faith turned around and gasped.</p>
<p>"I-Is something w-wrong?" Buffy asked, worried.</p>
<p>"Ah? Wrong? Oh no, I-I was just? admiring you, that's all," Faith said, blushing.</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy said, blushing as well.</p>
<p>Faith gulped and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Okay, let me help you."</p>
<p>Buffy turned a bit and Faith clasped on the bra.</p>
<p>"Damn, I should've brought one that clasped on in front. Stupid much? Sorry."</p>
<p>"I-It's okay."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's get the rest on."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Doctor Giles and Mrs Spencer arrived just as Faith was putting on Buffy's shoes.</p>
<p>"Are you ready?" Mrs Spencer asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mom."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Giles came closer with a wheelchair.</p>
<p>"I-I can w-walk," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, hospital policy."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment and then got up. Faith let her sit into the wheelchair by herself, but she was ready to assist.</p>
<p>"And remember, no strenuous activities."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Doc, I'll pamper her like a baby," Faith said.</p>
<p>Giles blushed a bit.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt of that," he murmured.</p>
<p>"Let's go," Faith said and started to push Buffy's wheelchair. "Thanks, Doc!" she called and they were away.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Doctor," Mrs Spencer said.</p>
<p>"No problem, Ma'am."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Doctor."</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Ma'am."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Outside, Faith helped Buffy into the car and then they drove home. When they arrived to the house, Buffy stared at it, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>"Y-You l-live here?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"W-Wow. It's b-big."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Mrs Spencer parked the car and Faith helped Buffy out. Buffy seemed to be able to walk, so she merely held her hand as they walked in.</p>
<p>"Welcome home, Buffy," Faith said when they entered.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at her and smiled, and Faith just couldn't help but think that it was the most beautiful sight in the world.</p>
<p>"Let me show you to your room."</p>
<p>Faith led the way upstairs, making sure she wasn't too fast for Buffy, who was apparently a bit tired after climbing the stairs.</p>
<p>"You okay?" she asked, concerned.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"J-Just a b-bit winded."</p>
<p>"Okay. Your room's right over there. And this one's mine. Mom's bedroom is over there and that's the bathroom," Faith gave her a quick tour as they walked to Buffy's room.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"O-Okay."</p>
<p>"Okay, here we are," Faith said and opened the door.</p>
<p>"Wow," Buffy said, impressed, as she entered. "A-And it's all f-for me?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Wow." She went to the bed and sat on it. "It's so s-soft," she said and bounced up and down. "And b-big."</p>
<p>"Yes. We'll drop by your place later, okay? To get your stuff."</p>
<p>Buffy's face became serious and she nodded.</p>
<p>"O-Okay."</p>
<p>"Good. And tomorrow, we'll go shopping."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"Now let's go to my room, so you can pick some clothes to wear tomorrow, and then I'll show you the rest of the house."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said and took Faith's hand.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>By nightfall, Buffy had already settled in. She and Faith had gone to the place where she had lived before and gotten the few meager possessions and some of the clothes that weren't worn out and which Buffy liked. Some of the clothes had looked ridiculous to Faith, but she didn't really mind Buffy wearing them, she knew she would find Buffy attractive in anything. Buffy had, of course, blushed at the compliment.</p>
<p>They kissed before going to bed and they both lay awake, thinking about the future. Buffy was also not looking forward to going asleep, because she had had several nightmares while she was in the hospital. She hesitated for a while and then finally got up and went to Faith's room. She knocked hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>Buffy opened the door.</p>
<p>"H-Hi."</p>
<p>Faith was immediately alert.</p>
<p>"Buffy. What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"N-nothing, I-I just? C-Can I s-sleep with y-you? I-I-I-I m-mean, j-just sleep. I-I had n-night-m-mares a-and?"</p>
<p>"Sure, come," Faith said and pulled back her blanket.</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment and entered. She closed the door and then slowly approached the bed. She hesitated again and then got in. Faith covered them again. They lay on their sides, staring at one another for a few moments and then Faith lay on her back and motioned Buffy to cuddle up. Buffy didn't hesitate.</p>
<p>"I love you, Buffy," Faith said and kissed her on the top of the head.</p>
<p>Buffy looked up.</p>
<p>"I-I love you t-too, F-Faith."</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Good night."</p>
<p>"G-Good night."</p>
<p>They lay like that until they fell asleep, Faith thinking that she finally found someone special and Buffy thinking that she was safe in Faith's arms, and loved.</p>
