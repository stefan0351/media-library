<p><b>So I gave them an update. Bitches like updates.</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I perched on a rock in the clearing, staring absently at the ground Lilly had once laid upon. It was at that very spot where I had found her, bloody and unconscious. I remembered the trembling fear that clawed at my heart when I thought she might have died after rescuing me. I remembered the overpowering relief I felt the moment I discovered that she was still breathing. The rain had washed away the blood, but the memory would always haunt me. If I had of just been more reasonable and given Lilly the chance to explain things, maybe she wouldn't have been as badly hurt. Maybe she could have warned me about Oliver and the battle would have never occurred.</p>
<p>I shivered in the chilled autumn air, waiting for the sun to peek from behind the clouds, and peered at the trees, searching for Lilly's silhouette through the gaps between the trunks. Today was the day she changed back. I woke up at the crack of dawn, leant forward over Lilly's sleeping form, and prodded her soft neck until she growled and opened her eyes. I smiled and climbed out of bed, pulled whatever clothes I first found out of her duffel bag, slid into my boots, and bounded for the door.</p>
<p>Lilly followed me with a huff and we had made our way into the forest, so she could be concealed as she morphed back. The rain had restricted us to the indoors and I missed walking to school. The small journey always chased away the fatigue that clung to my mind, but without it, I constantly felt physically and mentally stifled throughout the day.</p>
<p>I heard the flutter of leaves behind me, and before I could register the chance of danger, warm arms were encircling my waist. I smiled and melted against Lilly's chest, unaware that I had been longing for a proper hug so much. I twisted in her hold and wove my arms around her neck, settling into her embrace. Lilly chuckled, her chest vibrating beneath my cheek.</p>
<p>"I didn't think you'd miss me," she said, her voice sounding thicker than what it usually was.</p>
<p>"I did. A lot. There's so much I wanna know." I withdrew to meet her blue eyes, but before I could let them suck me in, my gaze landed on Lilly's face. I gasped, my hand shooting up to trace the various scars etched viciously into her once perfect features.</p>
<p>"Oh, God, Lilly..."</p>
<p>Lilly knew exactly what I was staring at and reached to remove my fingers. There was a sullen dullness in her eyes as she uttered quietly, "They'll fade." The broken inflection caused me to suffer from an agonising pang of remorse. I caused this.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. It's all my fau-"</p>
<p>"No, Miley, it is <i>not</i> your fault. I have told you hundreds of times that I don't blame you for what happened. Only Oliver is to blame. Not you. I love you." Her certainty startled me and once more, I was in her arms, being squeezed with inhuman strength. I could barely find my voice. Lilly loved me?</p>
<p>"I love you too, Princess." It sounded right to say. There was no other word to express how I felt for Lilly. She was like family now.</p>
<p>"Don't call me that!" she demanded amiably.</p>
<p>"Oh? What are you gonna do about it?" I challenged.</p>
<p>"Well, since you asked..." Grinning wildly, Lilly heaved me off the rock and carried me over to the lake.</p>
<p>"No! You wouldn't!" I cried, clinging to her as she held me over the surface of the rippling water. The sun was finally beaming through the slit of space between the clouds and its rays filtered about the opening Lilly and I stood in. The water glittered under the light and I turned to meet Lilly's gaze frantically.</p>
<p>"Wanna bet?" she said, her teeth exposed in a frolicsome smile that touched my heart as warmly as the sun did my skin. She regarded me with such a strong fondness that I forgot about the threat of being submerged in the fish-infested lake and just watched her. Her scarred face, still strikingly beautiful, was bright and well-defined. It was as if these last few weeks had robbed her of a portion of her innocence and aged her countenance, making it appear, not refreshingly childish, but appealing and womanly. However, her irises were unchanged. As blue as the hidden sky and as lively as ever.</p>
<p>One of her hands was poised between my shoulder blades and the other supported the underside of my knees. I dangled helplessly over the water, but it didn't scare me. I had suddenly lost sight of what was around me. All I could absorb was Lilly's ample power as she delicately drew me back to her body, our gazes still locked.</p>
<p>"Would you ever go back, Lilly?" I asked, my voice just above a whisper.</p>
<p>"Back where?"</p>
<p>"Home, to your mama." At the mention of her mother, Lilly's face lost its smile and the trance-like state we had fallen into diminished. She lowered me to my feet.</p>
<p>"I can't go back. She doesn't want me anymore," she spat.</p>
<p>"Come on, you're her daughter. How could she not want you back?"</p>
<p>"Some people aren't as understanding as you, Miley. My mother, she thinks I'm... She thinks I'm a monster. I can't go back just to have her look at me the way she did when I changed in front of her... It's too hard."</p>
<p>"You have to face her someday."</p>
<p>"I know, but not now, or anytime soon. I'm happy here with you," she affirmed and her expression softened as she looked at me.</p>
<p>I smiled and reached for Lilly's hand, but a loud rustling sounded beside me and I whipped around, half-expecting Oliver to leap from the bushes with a desire to decapitate me. A flash of brown asserted the possibility and I backed into Lilly, but her posture remained placid as she laughed lightly.</p>
<p>I was momentarily confounded, but as I watched the shivering leaves not three feet away, I saw a small rabbit hop from its hiding place. I sighed and muttered "you could have told me" to Lilly as I observed the rabbit. It chewed at the grass and moved closer, undeterred by Lilly and I. I pondered briefly about whether it was someone's pet that had escaped its hutch, but then Lilly crouched down with a raised hand.</p>
<p>"You can't really expect it to- oh." To my surprise, the rabbit waltzed right up to Lilly and bravely sniffed her fingertips. I stared at the small creature, wondering how exactly it knew Lilly wasn't a threat. "How did that happen?"</p>
<p>"Easy. It sensed my intentions," she clarified.</p>
<p>"But <i>how</i>?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure. It just kinda came with the whole 'werewolf' package deal."</p>
<p>"You can talk to animals? Like a modern Dr. Dolittle?"</p>
<p>"You're a comedian, Miley," Lilly deadpanned.</p>
<p>"Thank you. So, can you?"</p>
<p>"No, I can't. There's just... this silent communication between every living thing. Like, we all understand each other. When I stopped freaking out about what was happening to me, I actually started to appreciate this fact the most." There wasn't a single trace of disgust in Lilly's voice, which indicated that she had finally welcomed what she was.</p>
<p>"And that's the best part of being a werewolf?"</p>
<p>"Well, it was. Now it's more like the second best thing."</p>
<p>Lilly took my arm and pulled me down to a squatting position, gesturing towards the seemingly tame rabbit that calmly gnawed on the grass. I extended a cautious hand, waiting for some sort of rejection from the small animal, but it remained undisturbed by my presence. I nudged its ears gently, gauging its reaction. Nothing. I stroked its back. Still nothing.</p>
<p>There was tranquillity in this moment. Lilly was beside me, breathing softly, and we were doused in sunlight that promised clear days from then on.</p>
<p>"What's the first?" I asked, breaking the silence, but not the peace.</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"The thing you appreciate most?" I glanced at Lilly, but she was fixated on the rabbit. There was a faint smile on her lips that only grew when our eyes connected.</p>
<p>"Your acceptance."</p>
