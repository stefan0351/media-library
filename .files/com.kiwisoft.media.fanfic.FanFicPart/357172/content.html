<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 20: The Prom-->

<p>Willow and Buffy were in 'April Fools', the trendiest dress shop in Sunnydale. Well, the only one that had the Cordelia Chase Seal of Approval, anyway. They needed to find dresses, and quick. The prom was two nights away, and they both wanted to go all out, but with Buffy's unpredictable slaying schedule, they didn't know when the next free moment would be. They did know that they wanted the night to be memorable. For it to be the one shining moment in front of their peers.  </P>
<p>Willow was ecstatic, and she didn't seem to be nervous or apprehensive at all. Buffy, on the other hand, was worried. She wanted everything to be perfect; she wanted everything to be special. She just had this nagging feeling that no matter how hard they would try, that the rest of the student body would squash their efforts.</P>
<p>Prom Night was the unofficial end of both their "pre-adult" lives. And any other person would be sad they were leaving, but Buffy wasn't. She wished she could be, but she just looked at graduating as a way to move on with Willow to a place where they could start anew. Without people already judging them, and to be able to make a fresh start. It would be a nice change of pace from what they had been put through by their classmates. </P>
<I><P>'Let's face it. We both haven't been looked at very nicely by anyone.'</P>
</I><P>She wanted to be sad she was growing up. She wanted to leave as someone known for contributing positively to her class. Not as someone who was a 'freak' or someone who started fights and cut classes. She wanted everyone to see Willow as beautiful and friendly, not just as someone who used to give people answers to the homework every night. She wanted every one of her friends to get recognition.</P>
<P>For three years they all had protected the student body from everything the Hellmouth spewed out. From hyenas, to vampires, to invisible girls, and if it was just this once, she wanted her and her friends to get at the very least, a thank you. </P>
<I> <P>'Just gotta deal, I guess. We're the silent, misunderstood heroes. And heroines.'</P> </I>
<P>"…so I went by the gym yesterday. Everything looks really good." Willow was in mid sentence.</P>
<P>"Rewind please?" Buffy shook herself out of her thoughts, and gave Willow an apologetic look.</P>
<P>"I went by the gym to see what they were doing for the Prom, and they really did a lot of work on it. You okay?" Buffy smiled. "That was a fake, Buffy. You know how I feel about that."</P>
<P>"Sorry, Will. I'm just thinking…about stuff."</P>
<P>"Prom stuff?"</P>
<P>"Yep."</P>
<P>"Everything's gonna be fine, you'll see."</P>
<P>"How…you know something."</P>
<P>"What makes you say that?" Willow picked up a dark blue, glittery dress and suppressed a smile. She wouldn't. This was too important. "Do you like this one?"</P>

<P>Back in the storeroom of 'April Fools', Cordelia took the last of the dresses out of the new shipment, and sighed. She grabbed a hangar and made her way out to the front of the store. </P>
<P>"I'm gonna hang this up, and then I'm taking my break." She told the other girl who was in the room with her.</P>
<P>"Take the rest of the day off. The Prom's soon isn't it?"</P>
<P>"Yeah. I'm not gonna go, though."</P>
<P>"Why not?"</P>
<P>"I haven't finished paying for my dress yet."</P>
<P>"Won't your date wonder why you don't want to go?"</P>
<P>"Yeah." She looked sad.</P>
<P>Cordelia walked out into the customer area of the store and made her way to the assigned rack. She barely noticed Buffy and Willow's presence, before they turned around and spotted her. There wasn't any time to run away.</P>
<P>"Hey Cordelia!" Willow said.</P>
<P>"Buffy…Willow…you're here…great…"</P>
<P>"Yep. After three years we're finally following your fashion advice." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Oh…well…you know what they say. Better late then never."</P>
<P>They had never seen Cordelia act so jumpy before. Willow finally noticed the nametag on her shirt.</P>
<P>"You…work here?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"Surprising, huh?" Cordelia asked, defensively.</P>
<P>"How come?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"Daddy just decided to not do his taxes for the last decade. No warning, or anything. I can't afford college, or a prom dress."</P>
<P>"Does Xander know?"</P>
<P>When Cordelia realized that they weren't going to make any kind of comment about her sudden loss of wealth and status, she softened.</P>
<P>"No. I've…I don't wanna tell him. After graduation, I'm leaving."</P>
<P>"I'm sorry, Cordy. Xander should…he loves you, ya know." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"I know, and that's why I can't tell him."</P>
<P>"You know we're both here for you." Willow said. "With whatever you're gonna do."</P>
<P>"Thanks." She gave them a genuinely appreciative smile, and pushed aside her problems for the moment.</P>
<P>Buffy got her wallet out of her pocket. "How much more do you need?"</P>
<P>"No I -" </P>
<P>Willow got hers out as well. "Go get the dress."</P>
<P>She hugged them tightly.</P>
<P>"If you're off work, we could really use your help." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"You should really try to be more fashion-conscious, Buffy."</P>
<P>"Well, maybe I'll take a class on it after the Ascension. If I'm alive and all."</P>
<P>Buffy turned away quickly, and walked to the other side of the store.</P>
<P>Willow and Cordelia were both upset at Buffy's sudden negative and depressed attitude, but then smiled because they knew her mood would change soon. </P>
<P>"Did you tell her?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<P>"Of course not! I've been good." Willow grinned.</P>
<P>They joined Buffy, and got to work.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Were you two ladies successful in your hunt?" Xander asked Buffy and Willow later at the Bronze.</P>
<P>"As in dresses." Oz clarified.</P>
<P>"Oh…yeah." Buffy drifted.</P>
<P>"They're great. If it wasn't for Cordelia…" Cordelia looked at her wide-eyed for a second. "Who we just happened to meet when she came from…some other place that…wasn't…where we were." Willow mouthed a silent apology to Cordelia.</P>
<P>"What about yours? Do I get a preview?" Xander asked Cordelia somewhat suggestively.</P>
<P>"You can see the dress," Cordelia made sure 'dress' was said clearly, "at the Prom, Harris." She was good at not letting her expression betray what she was really thinking about. Buffy had to give her that. </P>
<P>"I need caffeine. Anyone want?" She said.</P>
<P>They all shook their heads, and Buffy walked over to the bar.</P>
<P>"She's been less than happy lately." Xander said.</P>
<P>"She was cheery and happy for awhile, but the closer we get to graduation…" Willow started.</P>
<P>"Buffy wants to feel like she accomplished something." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Saving the world isn't an accomplishment?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<P>"There's nobody to appreciate it. Have we even ever really thanked her for keeping this round blue rock o' water of ours spinning?" Xander said.</P>
<P>"We never really…how could we have not -?" Willow was shocked at that, at herself. </P>
<I><P>'We take her for granted. She saves our lives, and we expect her to always be there.'</P>
</I><P>"Well it's natural after the first couple times of thanking someone for saving your life to start slacking." Oz said. "Not that I agree with that. It's just the way things end up."</P>
<P>"It shouldn't. That's well…wrong and I really dislike myself right now. I mean I tell her I love her every day, and I mean it, but 'thank you' and 'I love you' are two different things."</P>
<P>"Which are both important." Xander said. "Which is why the -"</P>
<P>They all shushed him as Buffy came back over.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy was battling her fourth vampire foe of the night. Giles sat calmly atop a headstone waiting for her to finish. The Prom was tomorrow night, and slaying was a great way to alleviate stress. </P>
<P>She pinned the vampire against a tree, and swiftly plunged her stake into his heart.</P>
<P>"Well…your speed has improved." Giles said.</P>
<P>"That's it?"</P>
<P>"I haven't been patrolling with you for awhile, Buffy. In fact, not even Wesley patrols with you. Is there some reason you wanted me out here tonight?"</P>
<P>"Just thought you might like to come along, that's all. If you don't -"</P>
<P>"I'm always glad to be in your company, Buffy," She smiled at him, "but what's bothering you?"</P>
<P>"Nothing." She sighed, and sat up against the headstone Giles was sitting on.</P>
<P>"You didn't ask me to come along for nothing."</P>
<P>"Do you feel like you've done anything with your life? I mean being a Watcher and…"</P>
<P>"There I times when I wonder if I've made anything of my life, yes. I studied for nearly my entire life to prepare me for my destiny as a Watcher, and I've been stripped of everything I worked for. Sometimes I wonder if I've wasted my life."</P>
<P>"Who wouldn't? I mean the Council's supposed to be this big, centuries old, thing, and then they fire you like a normal, everyday…"</P>
<P>"There are pluses, Buffy. Friendships I've made would have never have formed if I hadn't come here. Relationships…" She knew who he was talking about. "I've changed, I believe, for the better. And so have you."</P>
<P>"I know, and I'm glad I have. Found the people I have, gone through what I've gone through, but I've been here for three years Giles. The years that are supposed to be the best of my life, and I've spent them saving people and a world that doesn't even know I exist."</P>
<P>"I know you exist. Your mother does. Your friends…"</P>
<P>"And I wouldn't trade you or them for anything, but…oh I don't know."</P>
<P>"What did you do before you came here, Buffy? Before slaying?"</P>
<P>"Normal stuff."</P>
<P>"Such as?"</P>
<P>"I…"</P>
<P>"Can't you remember?"</P>
<P>Giles smiled at her, and she just stared. "No…"</P>
<P>"Do you want to know what high school is about, Buffy? It's about finding out who you are, establishing bonds with people. It's about preparing yourself for life, and about the experiences you have during your time there.</P>
<P>"You could know every single person's name in the school, and they could know yours, but that means nothing in the long term. Cordelia, Xander, Oz, and especially Willow, are the ones that you'll look back on, and look forward with. You may have come together under unusual circumstances, but you've stayed together. And that is an accomplishment in and of itself. They are true friends.</P>
<P>"You may not have had the chance to do 'normal stuff' as frequently as other people your age, but you've done them. Movies, dancing, dating. And on top of that you have saved the world and triumphed over every single challenge thrown your way.</P>
<P>"If people knew what you did, they would appreciate it as much as I do. As your friends do. Don't ever think you don't exist, Buffy, because if you didn't, no one else would either. Your high school years have been difficult, but you're leaving with a person you love very much, and who loves you in return, and going to college. You've survived, and I couldn't be prouder."</P>
<P>"You better not leave me. Ever." Buffy said, tears streaming down her cheeks.</P>
<P>"I would never dream of it." They smiled at each other. " Ah, tomorrow night's the…"</P>
<P>"Prom. Yeah, it should be something." She wiped her eyes.</P>
<P>He put his hand on her shoulder. "Don't worry yourself. Everything will be fine."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy and Willow were making their way to the gym. Buffy was wearing a long sleeveless, pink, silk dress. Willow had her hair up; a necklace, and a sleeveless, dark red, sparkling dress with a matching shawl. They were holding hands, their arms outstretched for everyone to see. </P>
<P>"Don't be so tense." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Why aren't you?"</P>
<P>"You'll see."</P>
<P>They entered the gym and went under the u-shaped "entrance" of red and white balloons. Lights were shining down on the floor, and a DJ was in the front. Buffy kept looking around at the already dancing couples, trying to see if anyone was looking at them. Surprisingly, nobody was.</P>
<P>Buffy wanted to relax, but she was still wary.</P>
<P>"Come on, Xander and Cordelia are already dancing. We have to catch up."</P>
<P>They walked out to the 'dance area' and made their way over to Cordelia and Xander. It was a semi-fast paced song, and they quickly got into it. Willow saw Oz dancing with Amy, her fellow wicca, and smiled at them. She smiled at Buffy, who returned it.</P>
<P>They shifted their gazes over to Cordelia who had decided to drag Xander to a table. She had made her decision.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Xander, I have to tell you something. I'm…leaving after -"</P>
<P>"I know."</P>
<P>"You do?"</P>
<P>"Well, when I went by your house and saw a guy in a suit talking to your mom, and two big sweaty guys taking away your furniture…"</P>
<P>"You saw that?" He nodded. "It wasn't something that was planned, the IRS just decided to repossess the house."</P>
<P>"A family move I could understand, but you're going on your own, aren't you?"</P>
<P>"Yeah."</P>
<P>"Why? Don't you wanna stay here with me? Or are you too afraid that people will think of you as Cordelia ' became as poor as her loser boyfriend Xander Harris' Chase?"</P>
<P>"Not everything is about you Xander. I just can't stay here. It'll be a chance for me to try and live on my own. Without being supported by my parents."</P>
<P>"Why can't we do it together?"</P>
<P>"I want to go to LA, maybe try and become an actress. I've got the looks." He huffed. "And if I thought you'd leave, I would've asked you."</P>
<P>He looked down at his lap, realized she was right, but quickly put a look of anger on his face.</P>
<P>"I knew you wouldn't leave your friends, and I'm okay with that. I wish I had made friends like Buffy and Willow a lot sooner. But this has nothing to do with me wanting to get away from you. I never thought I'd say it, but I do love you."</P>
<P>"No you don't."</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"This is your game, Cordelia, and you think I'm just a toy. You know, go be an actress, cause you sure acted circles around me. But you know what, I'm not gonna be like your other throwaways. I should have known from the beginning that you were just leading me along. I guess it's my fault that I made myself think I loved you.</P>
<P>"I'm ending us before you do. At least I can walk away with some dignity."</P>
<P>He got up, and started to walk away. She slapped him in the face, tears burning her face. "You bastard." She quickly shook the tears off, and walked out of the gym, trying to keep her head up.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>The lights were dimmed on the makeshift stage. It was nearing the end of the awards ceremony. Everyone looked on. Buffy was in the walkway in between the two crowds, getting punch with Willow.</P>
<P>"And the award for Sunnydale High's Class Clown for 1999 goes to Jack Mayhew." The student at the microphone said.</P>
<P>Jack put on a balloon hat and made funny faces sitting on the edge of the stage. He waddled his way back into the crowd.</P>
<P>"Please! Anybody can be a prop class clown. You know, none of the people who vote for these t hings are even funny." Xander said to Willow and Buffy over at the punch table, disappointed.</P>
<p>"Will, did they give out the idiot and big macho jerk award yet?"</P>
<p>"Nope. Who do you thinks gonna win?"</P>
<p>"Oh, there's no contest this year."</P>
<p>They both glared at him icily. They had seen Cordelia walk out, and went after her, but by the time they made it outside, she had already gone, her car leaving streaks where it had sped quickly from its space in the parking lot.</P>
<P>Jonathan came over to the microphone on stage, lowered it a bit, and spoke.</P>
<P>"We have one more award to give out. Is Buffy Summers here tonight? Did she, um..." </P>
<P>Everyone turned around, looking for her. She turned to Willow who just smiled at her puzzled expression, then looked in Jonathan's direction.</P>
<P>"This is actually a new category. First time ever. I guess there were a lot of write-in ballots, and, um, the prom committee asked me to read this:</P>
<P>'We're not good friends. Most of us never found the time to get to know you, but that doesn't mean we haven't noticed you. We don't talk about it much, but it's no secret that Sunnydale High isn't really like other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here.' "</P>
<P>"Zombies!" "Hyena people!" "Snyder!" The crowd shouted out.</P>
<P>Jonathan continued, " 'But, whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened, you seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been saved by you, or helped by you at one time or another. We're proud to say that the Class of '99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating class in Sunnydale history.'" </P>
<P>The crowd cheered.</P>
<P>"And we know at least part of that is because of you. So the senior class, offers its thanks, and gives you, uh, this."</P>
<p>He got handed a multicolored, glittering, miniature umbrella with a small metal plaque attached to the shaft.</P>
<P>"It's from all of us, and it has written here, 'Buffy Summers, Class Protector.' "</P>
<P>The crowd applauded and cheered, and Buffy couldn't move.</P>
<P>"Go ahead. You deserve this." Willow kissed her, and let her go. "Oh, and Buffy?"</P>
<P>She turned around.</P>
<P>"Thank you."</P>
<P>Before she walked up to the stage, she saw Giles by the entrance looking at her, smiling.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>It was the end of the night, and the final song was playing, It was a slow, soft song, and Buffy stood in front of Willow and offered her hand.</P>
<P>"Dance with me?"</P>
<P>Willow took her hand, and they went out amongst all the other couples. As they went further in the mass, Buffy heard soft words of apology and thanks echoing through the crowd. </P>
<P>They found their spot, and Buffy wrapped her arms around Willow's neck.</P>
<P>"So, was this night everything you hoped?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"More than that. I never expected this."</P>
<P>"I'm glad. You're happy now? No sad thoughts?"</P>
<P>"Nope. I was confused for a little while, but I figured something out."</P>
<P>"What's that?"</P>
<P>"That even though my life is dangerous, and even though it's not 'normal' to a lot of people, to me, it's perfect."</P>
<P>Willow smiled and put her arms around Buffy's neck. They pulled each other close, their foreheads touched, and they kissed softly, dancing slowly to the music.</P>
