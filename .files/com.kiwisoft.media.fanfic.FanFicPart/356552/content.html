<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 12 -->

<p>The sleek black Lear jet glided easily out of the gun-metal grey sky and
landed smoothly at the small private airstrip just outside Sunnydale. It
taxied directly to a large hanger that sat away from the other
buildings. </p>

<p>The only break in the planes shining black exterior were the white
"call" letters required by international laws and the crossed gold keys
of the Vatican.
It sat all alone on the tarmac like some solitary bird of prey. </p>

<p>No one moved toward the plane and there was no movement from inside the
curious aircraft. A long black limousine pulled into the airstrip
driving onto the tarmac heading directly to the waiting private jet. It
came to a halt next to the plane and the planes passenger door opened. </p>

<p>A chauffeur got out of the limo and hurried to the rear door closest to
the plane, opening it then turning to look expectantly toward the plane.
Three men, in long black coats and black hats with wide flat brims that
partially hid their faces, got out of the aircraft and headed straight
to the limo. </p>

<p>The first two entered the car with only a slight nod of acknowledgment
to the driver. The third stopped and held out his hand to the nervous
young man who immediately knelt down and kissed the large ring on the
mans finger. </p>

<p>"Welcome your eminence." the driver said reverently as he stood up. </p>

<p>"Thank you Brother Jeffrey." the man said his voice soft and deep, with
a middle European accent. "You know where we need to go and please in
this capacity I am a simple Abbot, nothing more." </p>

<p>"As you wish father." the driver answered. "If you wish we can go
straight there now." </p>

<p>"Fine, brother Jeffrey, fine." the man said placing a hand on the eager
younger mans shoulder and giving it a friendly squeeze. "You are
efficient and prepared as always my son, which is why you were chosen
for this particular mission. Our order is pleased and proud of the way
you have handled this difficult and unusual task." </p>

<p>The driver blushed slightly at the praise from his revered superior. He
mumbled his thanks and after the man was in the limo he shut the door
securely and hurried and slid into the drivers seat. </p>

<p>The limo swiftly and silently left the airstrip and smoothly onto the
road headed toward Sunnydale.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>The last crimson rays of sunset faded from the sky, surrendering to the
black velvet blanket of night. The Slayer sat on the couch between her
lovers legs, leaning back into Willow using her for a back rest. </p>

<p>Willow had her arms wrapped around Buffy, enjoying the feel of her lover
against her and feeling her warmth even through their clothing. The
witch rested her chin on top of the Slayers blonde head, leaning down
every once to whisper some random lovers secret in Buffys ear causing
her to shiver with delight. </p>

<p>This was the first time in weeks either of them had been this relaxed,
even though they both knew they'd soon be facing one of the most
dangerous enemies any of them had ever faced. </p>

<p>The revelations of earlier in the day, along with Giles plan slowly
coming together had gone a long way toward normalizing their emotions.
Even though they knew that when they made it past this night they still
faced two of the most important days of their young lives they were
positive they could get through it together. </p>

<p>Both Willow and Buffy knew that one of the smartest decisions they'd
made was putting Cordelia in charge of the wedding arrangements. They
were amazed and proud of the way Cordy had handled it all and was still
on speaking terms with both of their mothers. In their eyes their friend
was a miracle worker. </p>

<p>Being an indispensable part of Giles' plan, Xander and Cordy 'the
Miracle Worker' had arrived earlier and had already been briefed on what
they were expected to do during the nights activities. They already had
chosen the weapons necessary to the tasks. </p>

<p>Willow had pulled her life long friend aside and given him some
"special" instructions about the others involved in the plan. Xander let
Willow know he completely understood and he had no problem what so ever
doing as she asked. </p>

<p>Now the young lovers were sharing one of Giles overstuffed easy chairs.
Cordelia was on Xanders lap her legs draped over, one arm her arms
wrapped around his neck. They were now engaged in a passionate kiss
after several minutes gazing into each others eyes or as Cordelia once
put it, looking all gooey eyed at each other. </p>

<p>Giles came out of the kitchen with his cup of freshly brewed Earl Grey
and frowned slightly at the sight of the two couples open displays of
affection in his living room. </p>

<p>"I feel like I'm living in some sort of teenage brothel." he said
shaking his head and chuckling softly. </p>

<p>"What's the matter G-man, jealous?" quipped Xander, causing the three
girls to laugh at the thought. </p>

<p>"That, my dear Xander, is not the point." Giles grumbled at the laughter
at his expense. </p>

<p>"Somebody is certainly Mr. Cranky this evening." Willow scolded the
ex-Watcher.
"This is just the logical expression of one persons love for another. So
there!" </p>

<p>The red head stuck her tongue out at the complaining man causing her
lover to giggle causing Giles further frustration. </p>

<p>Then he suddenly laughed at himself when he realized what he must sound
like. "Dear lord." he mused. "I sound like my father." </p>

<p>Before he could make any further revelations he was interrupted by a
knock at the front door. </p>

<p>"Must be a guest." he mumbled as he left the room. "I don't think I know
anyone that has the courtesy to knock any more." </p>

<p>Giles returned quickly with a man that looked very familiar to Willow.
Buffy felt her lovers body become ridged with tension and moved so she
could see Willows face trying to determine the problem. </p>

<p>The sight caused Buffy to slide over to the far end of the couch. </p>

<p>Willows normally open loving and compassionate face had been replaced by
a hard, suspicious, angry, glaring one. Her eyes seemed to radiate a
pulsating green glow, that was apparently aimed at the man that just
entered with Giles. </p>

<p>"What is it sweetheart?" Buffy asked concerned by her lovers sudden
change and a little frightened. "What the matter?" </p>

<p>"Why is HE here, Giles?" the witch snarled not bothering to hide her
anger and distrust of the man's presence. "No one here is ill or
requires the services of this 'doctor'." </p>

<p>"You know why I'm here, young one." the man said softly before Giles
could say anything. </p>

<p>Willow and the man stared at each other, everybody was looking first at
Giles then at Willow then at the newcomer then back to Giles searching
for some explanation for their friends strangely hostile behaviour. </p>

<p>"Who is this Giles?" Buffy asked, rising from the couch disturbed by
Willows uncharacteristic behaviour. </p>

<p>"I doubt if you remember Buffy." Giles answered eyeing Willow. "This man
is the doctor that tried to help you during your recent illness. This is
Dr. Jeffrey Fallon." </p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you doctor." Buffy said holding out her hand. </p>

<p>"NO!" Willow barked angrily. </p>

<p>Buffy stopped and looked at her obviously very upset friend. She started
to ask why she was being so rude when three more men entered the room. </p>

<p>Buffys attention was drawn away by a low menacing growl coming from her
lover as the three strangely dressed men came in. She was shocked by the
hostility that Willow gave off in waves. </p>

<p>Buffy could tell the young witch was bristling with fury, apparently
caused by the newcomers. </p>

<p>"What is your purpose here priest?" Willow snarled challengingly. "Come
to murder my soulmate and I, like your pious forefathers did our sisters
just a few centuries ago?" </p>

<p>The glow from Willows eyes seemed to spread out, first around Willow
herself, then it expanded to engulf her other half. </p>

<p>Everyone else in the room wisely moved back out of the line of fire,
surprised by their normally sweet even tempered friends sudden display
of hostility and power. </p>

<p>Giles stepped up and started to speak but was stopped by the raised hand
of the shortest and oldest of the newcomers. </p>

<p>"You are the one that found and destroyed our hidden archives." the man
stated as fact not a question with a slight sad smile. "Do not interfere
Watcher, knowing what she read in those files she has every reason not
to trust any of our calling." </p>

<p>"Why..ARE..you..here..PRIEST?" Willow spat out each word like a curse. </p>

<p>"Be calmed Sorceress." the man said. "We are here to help you and to
attempt to atone for a grievous error in judgment made by a misinformed
church because of untruths given her by certain over zealous, over
ambitious and yes even envious men that misrepresented the facts over
one thousand years ago." </p>

<p>Willow snorted in anger. </p>

<p>"Your kind slaughtered an entire class of women whose only sin was to
love each other and be warriors of the light." Willow stated, her
contempt dripped from her voice like venom. "How do you plan to atone
for their lives, how do you plan to justify your betrayal of their
innocent souls." </p>

<p>"Willow really." Giles said trying to stop her recriminations. "They are
here to help after all. You knew this, we discussed it." </p>

<p>"The Sorceress speaks her heart Watcher." The man said. "Her suspicions
are well founded." </p>

<p>"But your emin...." Jeffrey Fallon tried to protest but was stopped by
the
older man. </p>

<p>"Please, Brother Jeffrey, we discussed this." he scolded softly. "on
this mission I am a simple Abbot." </p>

<p>"You think to hide your true self from me priest?" Willow asked
sarcastically. "Why if not to hide your true intentions?" </p>

<p>"Not from you Sorceress." the abbot said his middle European accent
becoming more pronounced as he spoke. "But from others less dedicated to
our mission. The Darkness has its allies everywhere." </p>

<p>This revelation brought a heavy silence to the room. Willow faced the
newcomers, her attention focused on the Abbot, searching his face for
any hint of deception. The pulsating green aura swirled and glowed
around both Buffy and Willow shielding the lovers from any attempt at
treachery. </p>

<p>"We have known that once a Slayer and her Sorceress were together on the
Hellmouth, the joining of their souls would eventually occur." the Abbot
explained. "And with that joining would come the rebirth of the Sisters.
As part of the Church's commitment our order was formed to watch over
the two of you when the time came and provide what ever assistance we
could." </p>

<p>"At first we hoped that Brother Jeffreys treating of the Slayers illness
would be all that would be required." his explanation continued. "But
circumstances have arisen that have caused us to take a more active role
in your joining. This joining was destined to happen and according to
terms created before the age of man the joining was considered sacred
and was deemed inviolate by both sides. Apparently someone on the side
of darkness has taken it upon themselves to violate the agreement and
interfere. This being is powerful and has a limited number of extremely
powerful allies, those however are nearly depleted. There will be no
reinforcement so they are desperate.
So now by the powers given us by God through the Holy Father in Rome, we
have left another office we hold in the church to return to our first
and foremost duty, as Brother warriors in the war against the dark and
to insure the your joining in the manner of the ancient Celtic sect
known as the Sisters of the Soul and in the name of the church to
welcome that sect as allies in our continuing war for universal
balance." </p>

<p>"Pretty words priest." Willow growled, conceding reluctantly. "But given
the track record of your kind, I'm sure you'll forgive me for not
trusting you completely. As you know both the Slayer and I are sworn not
to take a human life, our friends however have no such limitations." </p>

<p>She looked at Xander and when their eyes met Willow nodded slightly and
Xander smiled coldly. </p>

<p>"No prob Will." Xander said as he turned a hard humorless smile on the
clerics and hefted a 9mm automatic that appeared almost magically in his
hand. "No one will get a shot at your back." </p>

<p>The eerie green glow now enveloped all four young people. This
development caused a debate among the clerics, that was soon interrupted
by Willow. </p>

<p>"If you are truly here to help us priest, then we'll gladly accept." the
witch said her voice soft and clear while showing the iron in her words.
"But if you are contemplating treachery then as you can see we are
prepared to deal with it. We have no time for subtleties and
negotiations, no talks no compromises. Tonight is all or nothing." </p>

<p>Seeing the fiercely protective look in Xanders hard dark eyes and
hearing the calm confidence in Willows voice, and the determined looks
on all of the young peoples faces, Giles knew that they were not
bluffing. </p>

<p>He felt a deep sense of pride of the loyalty they displayed, but a cold
chill ran down his spine at the easy manner that Xander displayed in his
willingness to defend his friends, even to the point of murder. </p>

<p>"You seem to inspire great loyalty, Sorceress." the Abbot commented.
"That speaks well of you, but right now if we can, I need to speak
privately to you, the Slayer, and your Watcher." </p>
