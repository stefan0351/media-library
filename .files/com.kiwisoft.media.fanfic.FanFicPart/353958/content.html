<!-- About a Girl \ Part 18 -->

<p><i><u>Manning House – The Next Morning</u></i></p>

<p>Grace stomped into the living room exceeding pissed off as she checked her watch one more time. "Oh my god Jessie, I swear if you don't get your ass down here like ten minutes ago I am so outta here," she bellowed in the general direction of the stairs. She had wanted to get to class early because Mr. Dimitri had been acting strangely around her for the last couple of classes and she just had to know why. "Jessie!" she yelled again as Jessie's blonde head finally became visible at the top of the stairs as she came running down, flinging her bag around her neck as she went.</p>

<p>"God," Grace said getting a good look at the girl for the first time as she headed towards her. It looked like Death had visited her in the middle of the night and beat her with a big stick. "You really should lay off the drinking and the whoring," Grace said as Jessie approached her. "It's aging you," she continued waving her hand in front of Jessie's face.</p>

<p>"That's funny," Jessie muttered under her breath coming to a stop beside Grace. "I thought you were in a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Right," Grace said her mind back on track after commenting on the train wreck that was Jessie. "Come on," she said grabbing the girl by her shirt and tugging her into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Jessie," Lily called out as Grace continued to drag a worryingly passive Jessie towards the door. </p>

<p>Jessie paused upon hearing her stepmothers voice, her body going rigid and finally resisting Grace's pull. She had been waiting for this since her father had sent her up to her room the night before. This had to be where the yelling and the head shaking came in, and she was both terrified and relieved that the moment was finally at hand. She just wanted to get this over and done with. Taking a deep breath she slowly pivoted until she came to face Lily. "Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Here," Lily said tossing her a brown paper bag, which Jessie just barely caught before it hit her in the face.</p>

<p>"Thanks?" Jessie responded uncertainly looking at Lily completely stupefied. She hadn't been expecting lunch. But before she could say anything else Grace was dragging her once more, towards and then out the door.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I'm glad you called, I wanted to confirm that you'd pick Jessie up from school and I'd get her from the house, I'm trying to…" Karen started to say as soon as she heard her ex-husbands voice on the other end of the phone, but she was interrupted before she could continue.</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, that's fine, but that's not why I called," Rick said dismissively as he paced around his office whipping the phone cord around with him as he walked. "We need to talk about Jessie."</p>

<p>"Okay," Karen said slowly, leaning back in her chair. She could tell that Rick was upset about something, in his own quiet voiced, passive aggressive way. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"She …" Rick began trying to gather his scattered thoughts. "She snuck out last night ... with that girl. Right in the middle of the night, didn't get back until nearly dawn. This girl is clearly a bad influence…"</p>

<p>"Girl?" Karen asked interrupting his tirade. "Katie?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Rick replied his voice slightly agitated. "I mean, god knows what they were doing, I have no idea how long she was gone for! What could they have been doing for that long?" he continued knowing that considering the time he had locked the door and the time they had come back in that they could've been gone for over three hours, and he didn't even want to contemplate what and where they may have been doing things.</p>

<p>"What did Jessie say?" Karen asked frowning slightly. She was upset herself about what Rick was telling her, but he seemed to be agitated enough for both of them leaving her as the voice of reason.</p>

<p>"What?" Rick asked, Karen's voice dragging him out of his thoughts – for which he was eternally grateful.</p>

<p>"Well, you talked to her when she came in didn't you?" Karen asked trying not to get upset about Rick's spaciness and borderline hysteria. "What did she say about it?"</p>

<p>"She …" Rick started to answer in a perturbed tone, "I didn't really get a chance to… I mean there were other things to consider …"</p>

<p>"Your daughter snuck out in the middle of the night, what other things were there to consider?" Karen asked a bit irritably.</p>

<p>"I don't know, maybe the fact that she was kissing her best friend?" Rick snapped back, instantly regretting it. He shouldn't have broken the news to Karen like that, he thought shaking his head, he should have taken the time to explain what happened but Karen always knew how to push his buttons. And, now he'd gone and done it, she was going to be devastated by this.</p>

<p>"Oh," Karen replied lightly. "Well what did she say about that?"</p>

<p>"Oh?" Rick asked staring at the base of the phone incredulously as if it were Karen's face. "Oh? All you have to say about it is `oh'?"</p>

<p>"No," Karen replied with a sigh. "I did also ask what she said about it."</p>

<p>Rick paused for a second considering his ex-wife's response before continuing. "You're not the least bit … shocked by this?" he asked unable to understand how she could be taking this so calmly. He knew Karen and this was not something that she would take lightly.</p>

<p>"About Jessie and Katie?" Karen replied debating about whether or not she should tell him that she already knew and deal with the inevitable blow out that would ensue, or whether she should just let things alone and let him take what he wanted from her response. "No, not really."</p>

<p>"Did you know about them, before this?" Rick asked slouching down into his chair rubbing at his forehead. He was getting a headache, and depending on how Karen answered he was about to blow his top.</p>

<p>"I had an idea, yes," Karen replied carefully. "The signs were all there."</p>

<p>"And, what? I just wasn't paying attention?" Rick asked heatedly sitting up straight in his chair.</p>

<p>"I didn't say that," Karen sighed rolling her head to the side tiredly. "Does this mean you didn't ask her where she was?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't ask where she was," Rick responded rolling his eyes. "Listen," he said getting his act together. "Would you mind just coming by an hour or so later? I'd like to talk to her when she gets home." </p>

<p>"Alright," Karen said emphasizing with what Rick was going through now having been there herself not to long ago. "That'll be fine. That's fine."</p>

<p>"Okay, thanks," Rick said getting ready to hang up, before Karen interrupted before he could place the receiver down.</p>

<p>"Rick, just…" she started to say softly, her tone almost pleading with him to be careful about this.</p>

<p>"I know," he said realizing where she was going and cutting her off before she could continue. Jessie was his daughter too, and he didn't intend to attack her or in any other way berate her for whatever she had with Katie. He just wanted a chance to try and understand it. "I'll see you later."</p>

<hr>

<p>Katie let out a relieved sigh as she saw Jessie approaching her from across the schoolyard. It was almost time for class to start and when she hadn't seen the other girl she began to wonder just how much trouble she had gotten her into. "Billie," she greeted clearly relieved, "hey, I thought you'd found out where they buried Hoffa."</p>

<p>"Can I talk to you?" Jessie said barely glancing at the small group of people loosely gathered around her girlfriend. She really wasn't in the mood for small talk. "In private."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie said some of her enthusiasm at finally seeing Jessie disappearing now that she had gotten a good look at her. That was not a happy face. Her hangdog response was followed by a series of "ooohs" and "what's that? Burn" and various other commentaries before she shot them all disgruntled looks and walked off with Jessie.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," Katie, sighed once they got out of ear shot from her friends, her head dropping down miserably. "I swear I wouldn't have taken you out if I thought we'd get caught."</p>

<p>"There's nothing for you to be sorry about," Jessie replied softly, taking Katie's hand into hers and squeezing it softly as she looked over at her.</p>

<p>"Get a room! Preferably mine," Bob Brooks yelled from a nearby bench high five-ing his buddies as he tracked the two of them lecherously. There were other out girls on campus, but none of them came close to the hotness that was Katie and her girl.</p>

<p>"Get a life, preferably one without a blow up hole," Katie called back irritably flipping him the bird as they walked by, which was met by his buddies laughing at him and making `ouchy' faces turning away.</p>

<p>"We love you Katie!" One of them called after her to which she turned around and curtsied to graciously to before continuing on her way.</p>

<p>"Sorry about that," Katie said once again returning her attention to Jessie.</p>

<p>"You don't have to apologize for that either," Jessie said frowning at the memory of the last guy tracking Katie's ass as they had walked off.</p>

<p>"So, how much trouble did you get in?" Katie asked almost dreading the answer. Her ride home with Lily had been like the worst, most awkward experience ever. They hadn't said like one word to each other, the only interaction between them being Lily's sideways glances at her like every other second. She'd been convinced they were going to crash into a telephone pole or something. She loathed finding out how it must have been for Jessie.</p>

<p>"Don't know yet," Jessie responded softly. "I got `go to your room' on auto repeat," she continued remembering her dad's expression. "How did your dad react?"</p>

<p>"He bought some riverfront property on denial and has been resting there comfortably for the last year," Katie responded with a sigh. "Mom said she always suspected cause I was a little flamer always sneaking into the change rooms in the lingerie department, but she's so vacant that…" Katie stopped not wanting to go down that road. "Anyway, dad still thinks I loved Wonder Woman cause of the great writing and set design, and that's the way he likes it," Katie continued her tone melancholy despite the humor she tried to inject into her response. The truth was that it wasn't something that was talked about in her house. Except for the initial blow out that night her parents had found her and Sarah making out, they never brought it up or referred to it. Even though she knew they knew otherwise, Jessie was still merely referred to as her `good friend'. "Rick?" she then prompted breaking the silence. She'd made some kind of peace with her situation, now Jessie had to.</p>

<p>"You should've seen his face," Jessie said a moment later, unconsciously drifting closer to Katie. "It was just … it was just sad."</p>

<p>"And he didn't say anything to you other than `go to your room'?" Katie asked reaching down for Jessie's hand again having felt her girlfriend shift closer to her.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie said. "What does that mean? That he couldn't even talk to me."</p>

<p>"This is going to sound strange, but I think that maybe it's a good thing," Katie replied using her thumb to rub Jessie's hand. "I mean it had to have been a shock for him … to say the least. But, you know, even though he was probably freaked as all hell he didn't lose his shit or anything," she continued thoughtfully. "Sounds to me like he just needed some time to … what's that word … yeah, ruminate. He just needs some time to ruminate over it all."</p>

<p>"And once he's both rummed and nated?" Jessie asked glumly.</p>

<p>"You're probably going to get grounded," Katie replied seriously. "Cause once he gets over the whole kissing thing, he's going to remember that we didn't get back until five. Then you're going to get grounded."</p>

<p>"You think?" Jessie asked hoping that that would be all there was to it. Her mom had just started being normal about everything again, even suggesting that she invite Katie over the nights she went to her book club, so she wasn't really looking forward to another awkward home experience.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but don't worry I'll pelt rocks at your window like in that Swedish movie so that you know that I love you. Even though you're a hooligan," Katie replied smiling over at Jessie.</p>

<p>"You say the sweetest things," Jessie replied rolling her eyes but grinning at Katie warmly nonetheless as her girlfriend pulled her into a quick hug. The day may not have started out so well, but at least there was some sunshine, and since it was shining directly on her that was all that she needed.</p>
