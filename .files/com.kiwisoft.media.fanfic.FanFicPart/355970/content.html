<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 10 -->

<p>B'Elanna knew that she had some serious work to do in order to bring her hurt and her anger back under control-not to mention regaining the trust and respect of her friends and colleagues.  A year ago, after an incident on an alien world, Tuvok had offered to teach her some Vulcan meditation techniques, but she had quit trying after only a few abortive sessions.  She hadn't put her heart and soul into it back then because she really didn't believe she had a problem.  Now however, with her career on the line, she activated her comm badge, swallowed her pride and begged for help.  She was willing to do whatever it would take to get her life back under control, and to begin, in some small way, to heal from the pain of losing Seven.</p>

		<p>The morning staff meeting on the day B'Elanna was released from confinement was intensely nerve wracking for both Seven and B'Elanna.  Seven was afraid to see the beautiful engineer in case she just looked right through her as if she wasn't even there.  Despite Tom's insistence that B'Elanna wanted very much to talk to her, she was having trouble believing it was true.  B'Elanna, for her part, was terrified of seeing Seven after her latest humiliation.  If Seven had despised her for her lack of honour before, she was certain to be completely disgusted with her now.  Not to mention that she had the added worry of facing the entire senior staff and attempting to explain her behaviour over the past few weeks.  She felt as if her entire career and future depended on the next few minutes of her life.  She picked imaginary lint off of her uniform for at least 15 minutes before she dared to step out the door on her way to the meeting.  Her hands were trembling even before she reached the room and took her seat.</p>

		<p>Seven, who had been working already for two hours, kept to her new routine and only entered the room as the meeting was beginning.  She took her seat and, much to her chagrin, couldn't bring herself to look at the chief engineer sitting at the other end of the table.  She cursed her cowardice, but kept her eyes resolutely downcast.  Despite having thought of nothing else for the past two days, she still couldn't face B'Elanna's reaction to her presence here today.  She accused B'Elanna of being a coward and hiding behind her relationship with Tom in order not to be hurt, and here she was frightened to even catch the eye of the beautiful engineer in case she was rejected...the irony of this was not lost on Seven.  She silently berated herself for her childlike fear, but to no avail.  She studied the wood-grain pattern of the conference table as if her very life depended on it.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna, seeing that Seven wouldn't even look at her, felt that all of her worst fears had been confirmed.  Seven did despise her; there was nothing else she could do.  Hope on that front was lost, but over the course of the last couple of days she had reminded herself that there were other things that needed to be priorities in her life.  Voyager needed her, the crew, her friends needed her, and she wasn't going to let them down.  Not any more. She closed her eyes for a brief moment and recited one of the calming mantras that Tuvok had shown her.  </p>

		<p>Standing up to apologize to the senior staff, taking responsibility for her actions, was the hardest thing she'd ever had to do.  On another level she knew it was a further small step on the way to reclaiming her lost honour, so she poured her heart and soul into her words, hoping to convey how sincere she was in her regret over her actions. When she was finished with her apology, she took a deep breath and began to outline a plan she had been working on for the past two days.  She had wanted to back up her words with actions and so she had come up with this project in order to do something that would benefit the entire crew.   She had found a way to run Voyager's engines on an alternate fuel source, as a kind of backup since deuterium and trilitheum were often so difficult to find in the Delta Quadrant.  Paralithium, the fuel she had come up with, was abundant in this sector of space, and the refining process was relatively simple once the initial processing system was in place.  What was needed to make it work was an extensive retrofit of Voyager's engines so that they could be switched back and forth between fuel types with a minimum of fuss.  The project would require a great deal of work, but much of it could be done while Voyager was operational, and B'Elanna volunteered too much of the labour herself during her off hours.  It was a tremendous plan, and it would significantly enhance Voyager's ability to travel great distances without having to stop and search for fuel.</p>

		<p>When she had finished outlining her ideas she finally stopped for breath.  There was silence for a few moments while the rest of the staff absorbed the rapid influx of information.  There wasn't a person in the room who wasn't impressed with B'Elanna's brilliance, but more than that, everyone was quite simply relieved that this morning the B'Elanna Torres they knew and loved had shown up to the meeting.  Seven was filled with fierce pride in the Klingon's brilliance.  She was also relieved, perhaps more so than anyone else, that the B'Elanna of old appeared to be back.  She heard Harry volunteering to get involved with the project. It gave her an idea, one so bold that she spoke up before her brain kicked in and stopped her from speaking.</p>

		<p>"I would like to volunteer to assist Lieutenant Torres with this project."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was so shocked by Seven's words that her jaw dropped and she sat down abruptly in her chair.  Captain Janeway was amused by B'Elanna's reaction, and relieved to see that whatever rift Tom had caused in their relationship appeared to be healing.  She couldn't resist taking a poke at the fiery engineer.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant, what do you say, do you want Seven's help?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna leveled her best version of a command glare at the captain.</p>

		<p>"Um, sure, yeah...thanks Seven."  She had no idea what had prompted Seven to volunteer to spend time in her company, while to this point she still hadn't looked her in the eye.  She was confused...but for the first time in several weeks she felt a stirring of hope.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna spent the rest of the meeting in a daze.  Seven had volunteered to spend time with her while working on the project, but throughout the rest of the meeting she still refused to look over at her.  B'Elanna tried staring resolutely at the former drone, but got nothing back from her.  She switched tactics after that and tried pretending she wasn't looking at all, hoping that she would catch Seven sneaking a peak in her direction, but nothing worked.  It seemed like Seven didn't even want to acknowledge that she was in the room.  'Great,' thought B'Elanna, 'just add total confusion to the mess already swimming around in my head.'</p>

		<p>When Janeway dismissed the meeting, B'Elanna looked over at Seven once again, but, as had become her custom, the former drone got to her feet and quickly left the room without a word or a glance at anyone.  Seven was reeling from her own temerity in volunteering to work on B'Elanna's project.  The engineer hadn't seemed too thrilled with her inclusion on the team, and it had only been prompting by Captain Janeway herself that had finally forced B'Elanna to agree to it.  She had no idea how she was going to get through the weeks of work that the project would entail...she would be so close to B'Elanna, forced to see everyday just what it was that she had thrown away.  </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The replication team required a week in order to get all of the required materials ready for the assembly team, so Seven and B'Elanna didn't see one another for the entire time, as Seven had been assigned to the assembly and installation team.  B'Elanna had made several attempts to see Seven, but somehow the former drone always seemed to manage to avoid her.  If she didn't know better she would swear Seven had some way of knowing where she was on the ship.  The fact was Seven had written a sub routine that alerted her to B'Elanna's movements on Voyager.  Whenever the chief engineer headed toward her location she made sure to get out ahead of time.  She knew it was childish, and that sooner or later they would have to talk, but Seven was terrified that B'Elanna was seeking her out in order to tell her that she was off the project, and as much as she was dreading working in close proximity to the fiery Klingon, she was equally afraid of losing this chance to be close to her.</p>

		<p>During the course of the week, B'Elanna managed to use her meditation techniques, along with a heavy workout schedule on the holodeck to keep her emotions under control.  She had taken the bull by the horns on her first day back in charge of engineering and assembled the entire team in order to apologize for her behaviour.  It wasn't as hard as apologizing to the command staff had been, but it was humiliating nonetheless.  Her department had rallied behind her however, and as soon as she was done with her apology it was straight back to business as usual...they were simply happy to have her back on track.</p>

		<p>Her shift was over and B'Elanna took the opportunity to run up to the mess hall and grab some dinner before her first volunteer shift on the new processing unit.  She was starving from working all day without a break, but she was afraid she was going to lose whatever food she managed to shovel in; she was nervous about working next to Seven for the next 6 hours.  Neelix came over, full of enthusiasm for the project, which thankfully took her mind off the sense of impending doom that was building in her gut and she was able to actually clean her plate.  She had only a few minutes left before she was to meet with the team in engineering so she took her leave of the ebullient Talaxian and headed off to start the meeting.</p>

		<p>The team was assembled, and B'Elanna outlined her instructions quickly before they settled down to work.  Her heart had been in her mouth the entire time since she walked through the doors of engineering.  Seven was in the room, but as usual she didn't catch B'Elanna's eye, but stared fixedly at a spot several inches to the right of the chief while B'Elanna spoke.   B'Elanna had resisted the urge to assign Seven to work directly with her, and so here they were dancing around one another in one of the most awkward nights of either of their lives.  They were careful to avoid being too close physically to one another, and B'Elanna resorted to giving orders and instructions to the drone through the proxy of Vorik.  Seven kept her head down and worked furiously, following the orders she was given to the letter, even though they didn't come from B'Elanna herself, but rather from Vorik.  B'Elanna was refusing to even speak to her, and she honoured the chief's wishes in return-if she needed clarification on the given instructions she sent Nicoletti or one of the other crewmembers to ask the questions. The fiery Klingon was almost constantly reciting Tuvok's meditations in order to keep her temper under control.  Several times she had to invent a reason to go into her office so she could bury her head in arms and scream out her frustrations.  </p>

		<p>After 4 hours of steady, efficient work they were ready to begin the installation of the processing unit into the existing structure.  B'Elanna was on the other side of the processing chamber monitoring the pressure levels of the system as the installation team worked.  There was a sudden spike in pressure as they hooked in the new lines, but before B'Elanna could shout out a warning the line blew.  She watched in horror as a large chunk of metal shot skyward, striking Seven's forehead and knocking her backward as it flew.</p>

		<p>"Seven!"  B'Elanna shouted in fear.</p>

		<p>She vaulted the console and raced across the room, sliding to a stop on her knees beside her fallen friend.  Seven was lying on her back; there was blood streaming from a cut over her eye. B'Elanna pulled her into her lap and held her close.</p>

		<p>"Oh God Seven, open your eyes....look at me please.  You've just gotta be okay, don't do this to me Seven please."  </p>

		<p>As she pleaded with the former drone B'Elanna was gently stroking her face with trembling fingers...she felt something warm soaking into her pant leg and she looked down, her heart freezing with fear as she saw the thick red fluid pooling under Seven's inert form.</p>

		<p>"NO...don't you leave me Seven...not now," B'Elanna sobbed.</p>

		<p>Seven's eyes fluttered open.</p>

		<p>"I am not severely damaged B'Elanna," she finally spoke.  She had been enjoying the feeling of being in B'Elanna's arms and had been reluctant to open her eyes and have the moment end.</p>

		<p>For the first time in weeks their eyes met.</p>

		<p>"I thought...there's so much blood."</p>

		<p>"Chief," Nicoletti spoke from behind them.  "Its hydraulic fluid...I released the valve before the lines were seated securely.  It's my fault."  </p>

		<p>B'Elanna fought down her anger.  "Honest mistake Nicoletti.  Get a team in here to clean this up."</p>

		<p>"Aye sir."</p>

		<p>"We should still get that cut over your eye looked at."  B'Elanna's voice was almost a whisper.</p>

		<p>"As you wish," Seven replied, never taking her eyes away from B'Elanna's.  She was afraid to blink in case the break in contact signaled an end to their closeness.  She reveled in the feel of B'Elanna's fingers tracing softly over her skin.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna shifted her weight and stood, pulling Seven up with her.  </p>

		<p>"I'll go with you to sick bay."  Now that they were standing, B'Elanna no longer had a reason to touch Seven and their contact ended--the tender moment turned awkward once again.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna motioned to the door and Seven left with the engineer close behind her.  Once they were in the turbolift they stood silently beside one another.  Finally, unable to stand it any longer, B'Elanna reached out and took Seven's hand in her own.  She was relieved to feel the drone intertwine their fingers.  She gave a little squeeze, happy to feel Seven return the pressure.</p>
