<!-- The Closet \ Part Five -->

<p>Brooke slowly, curiously cracked one eye open.  For the last couple of
seconds she had been coated with a feeling of unease, as if someone
was watching her.  However, years of movies of the week and badly
acted films had instilled a certain amount of caution in her, and if
there was some bloody thirsty killer in the room she didn't want them
to know that she was awake, so she barely cracked open one eye and
looked out to see what awaited her.</p>

<p>"Ah," Brooke cried jumping back slightly.  What had awaited her was
Sam's face hovering inches away from her.</p>

<p>"Hee," and a smile was Sam's response to her.  Brooke frowned.</p>

<p>"What are you doing you psycho?" Brooke mumbled as she pulled herself
together.  Sam continued to smile.</p>

<p>"You asked me to wake you up," Sam replied seating herself of the edge
of Brooke's bed.  "So I woke you up."</p>

<p>"I said wake me, not stare at me like some pedophile in training,"
Brooke responded as she sat up slightly.  She hadn't bothered to get
under the covers, so all she had to do was rest her back against the
headboard to be on even ground with Sam-who seemed to be making
herself quite comfortable.</p>

<p>Sam's face dropped a bit when Brooke said that, her expression turning
serious.  Brooke wasn't sure what to make of the change so she
remained silent.  Sam turned her head so that she was facing Brooke,
her eyes locked on her intensely.</p>

<p>"I really didn't mean to scare you, I was just about to tap you on the
shoulder when you woke up," she began conciliatorily.   </p>

<p>"It's okay," Brooke responded feeling compelled to say something.
"I'm not really a morning…no, make that a getting up person.  It
doesn't really matter what time it is, I just don't like it."</p>

<p>Sam smirked but her expression soon became serious once more.  She
turned her head away again so that she was looking at her lap.</p>

<p>"I did watch you though," she said a moment later, raising her head to
look out the window.  Brooke looked confused but didn't say anything.
 "You're so small," Sam continued a second later.  "You looked
so….small," she went on hesitating for a second them shrugging her
shoulders helplessly as she repeated the word 'small'.</p>

<p>"I…" Brooke started, not at all sure what to make of Sam's behavior.</p>

<p>"Don't know what to make of that?" Sam asked interrupting Brooke, that
cocky smile of hers once again covering her face.  Brooke nodded
smiling herself, encouraged by the expression on Sam's face.</p>

<p>"If I were you I'd be a morning, or should I say getting up, person,"
Sam continued still observing Brooke.</p>

<p>"Why?" Brooke questioned intrigued by Sam.  She couldn't figure out
why the other girl was actually talking to her, she figured maybe it
was to show her up for that comment she'd made on the bus, but
truthfully she didn't care.  She just wanted to see where this was
going.</p>

<p>"Because like an astonishing one per cent of the population you
actually wake up looking refreshed and rosy cheeked," Sam said.  "It's
really quite remarkable how much money you spend supporting Max Factor
when it's good genes and enough sleep that do all the work."</p>

<p>Brooke stared at her, completely and utterly befuddled.  She was sure
that for a second or two after Sam had spoken her mouth had opened so
that she was gaping at the other girl, but she had quickly closed it
so that now she was only staring at her in amazement.  She didn't know
what to say to that, so she fell back on the old reliable route of
sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Flattery will get you everywhere, but you're already in my bed,"
Brooke said winking at the other girl.  She had assumed that Sam would
get all huffy at the comment, make some remark about her lack of
maturity and stalk into the bathroom where she would remain for so
long that Brooke would have no time to get in there before they were
called down for dinner.  Brooke was wrong, Sam did none of those
things.  Sam looked over at her and smiled.  Then Sam shifted her
position so that she was sitting leaned up against the headboard right
next to Brooke.</p>

<p>"That almost sounded like a invitation Ms. McQueen," Sam said
teasingly.</p>

<p>"Make of it what you will," Brooke replied because quite frankly she
had no idea what to say other than that.</p>

<p>"Alright," Sam responded thoughtfully nodding her head slowly in
contemplation for a moment before looking back over at Brooke.  "I
will," she continued, that smile, that damn cocky loveable smile back
on her face.  And before Brooke knew it Sam's lips were on hers,
pressing against hers.  Surprise caused her to try and jerk her head
back at first, it was a base instinct, but she found that she couldn't
do it.  Sam's hand had followed the course of her lips and was holding
the back of Brooke's head firmly in place.  The only way to stop the
kiss would have been for Brooke to push Sam away from her, and, well,
she found that she didn't really want to do that.  Her body relaxed
and she leaned forward into the kiss, surrendering to Sam's skillful
ministrations.  As she leaned into the kiss she felt Sam smile against
her lips then shift closer to her on the bed.  This caused Brooke to
smile herself before then forcibly bringing Sam's lips back to hers,
moaning into Sam's mouth as her passion mounted.  If this is how she
was woken up every morning, there just might have been hope for her
yet.</p>

<p></p>

<p>
"Sam?" Brooke questioned.  She was feeling a bit dizzy.  She didn't
understand it, she felt like she was being shaken.  "Sam stop that
this instant," she said looking across her and noticing that Sam's
hands were now on her shoulders and were apparently trying the shake
the shit out of her.</p>

<p>"Goddammit wake up!" Sam yelled shaking Brooke some more.  First the
stupid girl tells her to wake her up, then she lies there like limp
noodle mumbling at Sam while channeling somebody's mother.</p>

<p>"The…?" Brooke asked opening her eyes and seeing Sam standing over her
still shaking her for all she was worth.  "I'm awake," Sam still
didn't stop.  "I'm awake," Brooke repeated, her head was starting to
pound.  "Get your bloody hands off of me, I said I'm awake!" she
yelled finally raising her hands trying to beat Sam off of her before
she did some serious damage to her brain.</p>

<p>"Dinner, fifteen minutes," Sam told her with a scowl then the brunette
stalked across the room and walked out the door.</p>

<p>Brooke drew her knees up to her body and dropped her head onto them.
This was not good, she thought herself, although secretly she admitted
she liked how Sam had woken her up in her dream better than reality.
No, she then thought to herself, you will not think such thoughts.
This…nightmare, she continued as she flung her legs over the edge of
the bed and stood up, was not about Sam or sex or especially not about
sex with Sam.  That was just ludicrous.  It was about…about…about her
own narcissism, yes that was it.  She was far to complimentary to
herself in the dream, this was her subconscious's way of telling her
to get over herself.  Well, she thought, message sealed, signed and
delivered.  As she stood in front of the mirror, she decided - with
this new knowledge fresh in her mind-that she was only going to wear
foundation and lip gloss to dinner.</p>
