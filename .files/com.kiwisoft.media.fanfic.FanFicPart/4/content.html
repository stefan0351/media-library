<p>Buffy lay sprawled across Giles big overstuffed
couch watching Willow at the desk Giles had set up for her and her computer.</p>

<p>Willow was in deep research mode, pounding away at
the keyboard and staring intently at the glowing screen, the printer humming steadily
reproducing the information Willow was finding in her boundless cyber-universe.</p>

<p>Sometimes Buffy found herself getting jealous of
the time Willow spent with her computer it was hard not to, it was the only time that it
seemed Willow forgot she existed. She shifted uneasily at her feelings.</p>

<p>&lt;Get a grip girl.&gt; she told herself.
&lt;&gt;It's just a machine for gods sake.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy settled back and relaxed knowing it would be
hours before she'd be able to pry &#145;Computer Girl&#146; away from her workstation. She
smiled lovingly at the petite redhead, to Buffy everything Willow did was adorable. She
lay back and closed her eyes thinking of how much their lives had changed in the last
three months. &lt;It's funny,&gt; she thought. &lt;We thought it was tough admitting how
we felt to each other, boy were we wrong.&gt;</p>

<p>The first hurdle had been explaining their
relationship to the gang but as it turned out the only one the least bit surprised was
Giles. Everyone else's reaction had more or less about time. Apparently everybody knew how
they felt about each other long before they'd realized it themselves.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>&#147;Is that all you got us here for?&#148;
Cordelia said, &#147;That's so old news, people don't even talk about it anymore.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;What do you mean &#145;old news&#146; &#148;
Buffy asked more than a little perturbed by the strange turn of events.</p>

<p>&#147;Well for one thing the two of you have been
so gooey eyed over each other that even Giles noticed.&#148; Cordelia laughed ignoring
Xander's elbow nudging her in the ribs, &#147;and you know if it's not written in some old
dusty book Giles doesn't see it. I mean look how long it's taking him to realize that he
and Buffy's mom have the hots for each other.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Cordy please!&#148; Xander yelled at his
tactless girlfriend trying to save the man any further embarrassment. &#147;Nobody made
you the &#145;love police&#146;.&#148;</p>

<p>Giles was so shocked and flustered he couldn't
speak.</p>

<p>&#147;What are you talking about?&#148; Buffy
exclaimed &#147;Giles and my mother, really?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;That is neither here nor there.&#148; Giles
spoke up trying to regain some control over the conversation, &#147;What Joyce and I feel
or do not feel for each other is not the issue at here, the issue at hand is Buffy and
Willow and how they want to deal with their relationship.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I think what the G-man is tryin' to say
is,&#148; Xander said attempting to translate, &#147;now that you two have finally figured
out how you feel about each other, which I think is great might I add. Are you going to
try to hide it or are you going to out yourselves before someone does it for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&#147;Precisely,&#148; Giles agreed, &#147;If you
are going to live your lives out in the open, then I would urge you to inform your parents
first if for no other reason than respect for their feelings. This is not something they
should learn from someone else.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Oh goddess.&#148; Willow gasped &#147;I
forgot all about my parents.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Don't worry Will.&#148; Xander reassured her
almost too cheerfully &#147;We're here for ya'.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Quite so.&#148; Giles spoke up. &#147;We ALL
will give you what ever support you need.&#148;</p>

<p>Giles and Xander both gave Cordelia a dirty look.</p>

<p>&#147;Of course WE are,&#148; she said
defensively.</p>

<p>&#147;Oh great,&#148; Buffy muttered under her
breath &#147;With Cordy on our side how can we win.&#148;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Not all their friends had been quite so
understanding. While Buffy didn't have many &#145;friends&#146; to begin with, many of the
people she had become friendly with since starting college suddenly didn't seem to
remember who she was or had pressing business else where every time she was around. Some
even made the mistake of getting aggressively hostile over the subject, a mistake they
never made twice.</p>

<p>People she didn't even know would stare at her
when she went by like she had two heads or something and she swore if she heard the words
&#145;fucking dyke&#146; whispered behind her back one more time she was going to hurt
someone bad.</p>

<p>But as bad as it was for Buffy, it was many times
worse for Willow. People that had been her friends since grade school had turned their
backs on her. Buffy had spent several nights sitting up holding Willow while she wept over
some mean spirited hurtful comment one of her supposed friends had said.</p>

<p>That was the time that it took every bit of
restraint both Buffy and Xander had, to keep them from hunting the jerk down and giving
them the beating they so richly deserved, but Willow wouldn't let them and she recruited
Cordelia to help her, even though Cordy felt the same way they did.</p>

<p>She could understand why people would act that way
about Buffy but even she couldn't figure out why anyone would hurt Willow on purpose. At
the time Buffy couldn't see how things could get any worse for them.</p>

<p>She was wrong.</p>

<p>The next hurdle they decided to face was Buffy's
mother. Taking advantage of Giles promise and his personal relationship with Joyce Summers
they decided to have the conversation at Giles place, giving them a kind of home field
advantage.</p>

<p>Buffy thought she'd remember that evening as long
as she lived.</p>

<p>First the four of them went out for dinner then
back to Giles townhouse for drinks.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>&#147;Have a seat Joyce.&#148; Giles said
indicating a large overstuffed leather chair, &#147;Make yourself comfortable. Would you
like something to drink?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;A white wine would be nice Rupert if you
have it.&#148; She answered wearily.</p>

<p>&#147;Certainly,&#148; he said then turned to the
two girls on the couch, &#147;What would you two like, tea, soda, coffee?&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;A soda would be great.&#148; Buffy said her
voice actually cracking a little.</p>

<p>&#147;Me too please.&#148; Willow was so scared
she squeaked.</p>

<p>When Giles had left the room Joyce turned to face
her daughter and Willow.</p>

<p>&#147;Alright you two,&#148; she began &#147;are
you going t tell me what this is all about or do we sit here beating around the bush all
night until I go crazy and beat the truth out of you. Before you answer remember you may
be the high and mighty Slayer but I'm still your mother.&#148;</p>

<p>They heard a glass break in the kitchen so they
knew Giles had heard. The girls sat in stunned silence until Giles returned with their
drinks and a large glass of scotch for himself, he foresaw a long night ahead.</p>

<p>Buffy took a long drink from her coke and a tight
grip on Willow's hand.</p>

<p>&#147;Well mom&#133;you
see..I,..ah,..we&#133;&#148; Buff began unsteadily. &#147;I mean Willow and I
well,..ah&#133;we've been friends for a long time.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Yes, this I already know,&#148; Joyce said
firmly &#147;get on with it young lady what has happened.&#148;</p>

<p>&lt;This is definitely not the way I planed
this&gt; Buffy thought frowning slightly, &lt;Why can't I just say it.&gt; &#147;Just a
minute, let me finish,&#148; Buffy pleaded. &#147;This isn't easy for me mom.&#148;</p>

<p>Her mother heard the desperation in her daughter's
voice and sat back trying not to push her too hard.</p>

<p>&#147;Okay like I said,&#148; Buffy began again.
&#147;We've been friends for a long time and well no matter how much stupid stuff I've
done, running away, getting in trouble, blowing up stuff, even dating a vampire, and
getting her hurt, Willow has always been there for me, taking care of me comforting me
never judging me just backing me up and giving support and...&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;And Buffy's always done whatever she could
for me too.&#148; Willow added &#147;So...&#148;</p>

<p>She looked to Buffy and Joyce could see the love
in that look and deep down she already knew where this was going.</p>

<p>&#147;So,&#148; Buffy took back over, &#147;So
while we didn't mean to, I mean nobody does this on purpose it's too hard, they'd have to
be a moron to do this on purpose, what I'm trying to say is that sometime while all this
was going on our feelings for each other changed, kind of evolved into something more than
just best friends. What I'm trying to say is Willow and I&#133;we&#133;I mean,..she and
I..&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Love each other.&#148; Joyce finished for
her daughter.</p>

<p>Buffy could almost feel the silence that fell over
the room at her mother's words. No one said anything for what seemed a very long time, the
only sound any of them heard was their own heart beat pounding in their chest. &#147;I
wish..ah well..we..&#148; Buffy stammered, then she stopped and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>&lt;Get a grip girl!&gt; she told hersel.f
&lt;Your the Slayer damn it, you've faced demons from hell and legions of the undead and
your afraid to tell your mother you've found your one true love.&gt;</p>

<p>&#147;Buffy?&#148; Willow whispered.</p>

<p>&#147;It's alright baby I got it covered.&#148;
Buffy reassured her. &#147;That's right mother, we love each other. I know it's not what
you wanted for me and you probably don't approve but I'm hoping you of all people can see
past that.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Is it that important to you Buffy?&#148; her
mother asked a slight catch in her voice. &#147;Are you sure that this is what you really
want? I mean you've never given any indication that you were anything other than a
heterosexual.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;It's not that mom.&#148; Buffy explained.
&#147;I'd love Willow whether she was male or female. I've thought alot about it and
talked to Wills about it and I think I've figured it out.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy had hoped her mother would let it go at that
and not force her to explain any further.</p>

<p>&#147;Okay honey tell me,&#148; Joyce said leaning
forward trying desperately to understand her daughter's choices. &#147;I really do want to
understand.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Putting sex aside, because it's really not
all that important.&#148; Buffy began ignoring Giles' and her mother's raised eyebrows.
&#147;I fell in love with Willow the person, she's smart, she's kind, she's sweet, she's
caring she listens when I need to talk, she talks when I need to hear someone's voice, and
when I wake up in the middle of the night screaming from the nightmares with this god
forsaken destiny it's Wills that holds me in her arms and lets me know I'm loved and none
of the nightmares can hurt me cause my Wills is there to protect me.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy stopped unable to continue overwhelmed by
the love she felt for the petite girl beside her. She put her face in her hands trying to
hide her tears from her mother.</p>

<p>Willow put her arms around Buffy and pulled her
close trying to comfort her. She began rocking Buffy slightly and gently stroking her hair
as she felt Buffy's body tremble and shake wracked by uncontrollable sobs.</p>

<p>&#147;Hush now Buffy&#148; Willow crooned softly
to the crying girl, just like she did when Buffy had her nightmares. &#147;It'll be
alright now your Wills is here. I've got you sweetheart nothing can hurt you now.&#148;</p>

<p>Tears flowed freely from Buffy's mother's eyes as
she watched the two girls across the room. The honest open love she saw between them
caused an ache in her chest. She felt Giles come over and sit on the arm of her chair and
put a reassuring hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#147;You know it's true Joyce.&#148; Giles said
softly enough so that only she could hear. &#147;Look at them, have you ever seen so much
devotion between two people, no man could ever love her half as much as Willow does. I
know, I have watched her go from one relationship to another trying to find exactly what
she has right now with Willow.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;I can see that Rupert&#148; Joyce told him.
&#147;It's just hard for a parent to see their child setting themselves up for as much
heartache as those two are headed for. People they thought were friends will turn their
backs on them, even people in their own families will reject and ridicule them. Knowing
that I can't protect her from that is tearing my heart out right now but I don't know what
to do.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Listen Joyce,&#148; Giles began again
&#147;all you can do without losing your daughter is accept her as she is and support her
in any way possible. That is the best and most you can do. As for their friends, I am
proud to say they count me in that group, and believe me for the most part their true
friends not accept them, most of them knew that Buffy loved Willow before the girls knew
themselves and the girls came out to them so to speak and so far there have been few
changes.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Please Mrs. Summers&#148; Willow said so
softly she could barely be heard. &#147;Please don't hate us and don't turn away from us.
Buffy needs you, I need you, Buffy and I have talked about this a lot and we know we will
face some bad times with the way people are and all. I'm not even sure my parents will be
able to accept it but we thought we could count on you. You already know about destinies
and we learned that this was all a part of our joint destiny we thought you'd
understand.&#148;</p>

<p>Buffy's mother pushed herself out of her
chair and rushed over to the two girls and fell to her knees in front of them and put her
arms around them both. She held them not saying a word. The three women stayed like that
for several moments and Giles took that as his cue to leave. He slipped quietly out of the
living room and went to his study.</p>

<p>After several tries Joyce found her voice. &#147;I
could never hate either of you Willow.&#148; Joyce sniffed &#147;It was just, well&#133;a
shock is all. You guys kind of sprung this on me. I mean I came in here afraid that my
daughter was dating another vampire or was pregnant by some creature of the night. Give me
a little time okay. If I can get used to being the mother of the Chosen One, getting used
to you two being together will be a piece of cake. All I ask is that you're sure this is
what you want and that you tell your parents Willow it wouldn't be fair to have them find
out from someone else.&#148;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>That was all Buffy's mother said and within a week
she was reasonably comfortable with her daughter and her red-haired lover, in fact she
considered them both to be her daughters.</p>
