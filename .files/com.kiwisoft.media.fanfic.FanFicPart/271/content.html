<!-- When Turbolifts Collide \ Story -->

<P>"How in the hell could this have happened?"</P>

<P>"Captain?"</P>

<P>"Tuvok, don't you dare raise that Vulcan eyebrow of yours at me at a time like this.  I mean this is ridiculous."</P>

<P>"Ridiculous?"</P>

<P>"Tuvok, what did I tell you about that eyebrow and maybe ridiculous is the wrong word for it.  Preposterous is more like it.  I mean have you ever heard of two turbolifts colliding together in one shaft? Preposterous."</P>

<P>"Actually Captain, it was a forseeable event."</P>

<P>"What?!"</P>

<P>"So far during our seven years here in the Delta Quadrant we have experienced some most unlikely occurrences, most of which have occurred in the holodeck.  It was only a matter of time before our 'bad luck' shifted it's place of focus to the turbolifts."</P>

<P>"But..."</P>

<P>&lt;bang bang bang&gt;</P>

<P>"That I believe is the other turbolift's occupants trying to communicate."</P>

<P>"Who's down there?"</P>

<P>"Captain?  It's Lt. Torres and Seven.  I just finished speaking with the engineering crew and they said it might be a while before we can get out of here.  These lifts are really smashed together and stuck good.  I told them to get you out first but it'll still take at least two hours. So stay put and try and relax."</P>

<P>"Stay put, stay put!  Relax?!   How.... Why... I'm...</P>

<P>"Lieutenant, I believe you angered the Captain with that last statement."</P>

<P>"Why do you say that?  Oh, let me guess, borg enhanced hearing?"</P>

<P>"On the contrary, I know the difference between banging on the floor to communicate and stomping across the floor.  Right now the Captain has nothing to say."</P>

<P>"Oh."</P>

<P>"Why in the hell did I have to get stuck with Tuvok.  Lt. Torres, I order you to switch lifts with me."</P>

<P>"Um, sorry Captain but no can do.  Seven, do you and the Captain have something going on that would make her this impatient to spend some time with you?</P>

<P>"Describe 'something', Lieutenant."</P>

<P>"First call me Lanna since we're going to be spending a while together. I hate being called by my rank especially by you.  You seem to say it in a way that just irks me.   And I was just asking if you had a romantic relationship with the Captain."</P>

<P>"A romantic relationship?  I was unaware that I could have such a relationship with the captain let alone a woman."</P>

<P>"Of course you could have a relationship with a woman.  This is of course the 24th century.  Who ever gave you such an idea otherwise?"</P>

<P>"The Doctor."  </P>

<P>"The Doctor."</P>

<P>"Since I was unaware that such a romantic relationship could occur, I do not believe that I have had proper time to consider it as an option."</P>

<P>"Well, we have plenty of time here.  So, who of the female gender would you like to kiss?"</P>

<P>"I, uh, um, do not know."</P>

<P>"Seven, I thought borg don't lie.  So out with it."</P>

<P>"Have you ever considered kissing a female?"</P>

<P>"Okay, so you want to play change of subject.  Fine but if I answer your question you have to answer mine.  Yes, I have but I never actually kissed a woman before.  I've only dated guys but I have been curious."</P>

<P>"I, too, find that I am curious but I would not know how to go about satisfying that curiosity."</P>

<P>"Well, you could ask the person you would like to kiss to kiss you but if it's more curiosity or say experimentation then I'd suggest finding someone you can trust and also someone who would be interested in experimenting as well to ask to kiss you.  Does that make sense?"</P>

<P>"So, if you are just curious as you say you are why have you not asked someone you trust to kiss you?"</P>

<P>"Well, the only female I'm really close to who might be willing would be the captain but that would be like kissing my own mother.  Don't ask. Then there's Nicoletti, but I doubt she'd be willing to try it, she's completely straight as an arrow.  Don't ask.  And then that leaves, well.... it, uh, leaves, uh,.... you."</P>

<P>"It would seem logical and efficient for us to experiment with each other."</P>

<P>"Yeah, logical."</P>

<P>"There would be no feelings attached, just an experience.  So there will be no emotional repercussions.  Shall we proceed then?"</P>

<P>"Yeah, proceed."</P>

<P>&lt;insert tentative kiss on the lips&gt;</P>

<P>"That was, uh, hm, mmm."</P>

<P>"I believe I will need further experimentation."</P>

<P>&lt;insert smoldering lip locking tongue dueling kiss&gt;</P>

<P>"Seven, who was it that you were thinking about kissing before, cause they are going to be one lucky lady if you kiss them like that.  I know I'm swearing off men but you can even get Nicoletti to switch teams."</P>

<P>"But I do not wish to get Nicoletti to 'switch teams'.  I only wish to kiss you."</P>

<P>"Oh, mmm."</P>

<P>"Tuvok, what the hell is going on down there?  It sounds like Torres is killing poor Seven.  If she hurts her, so help me god."</P>

<P>"I do not believe Lt. Torres is hurting Seven of Nine."</P>

<P>"And how do you know that?  Oh, yeah, superior Vulcan hearing.  So what are they doing down there?"</P>

<P>"You do not wish to know.  Although, I believe I will tell you anyway and in great detail.  Perhaps you should sit down Captain."</P>
