<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 19 -->

<p>It had been 6 days since David brought Xander back from the Dreamtime.
In that time they had sat down and researched Murg Dor while keeping an eye
on Xander. They had listened as Xander had flash back through his life, from
the beginning to the more recent times. The good times, the funny times, and
as Willow had warned, a lot of bad times. The abuse by his parents, his
failures at school, his broken relationships. It was heart breaking to
witness Xander weeping as he unconsciously recounted the night Jesse died. He
had been quite now for about three hours and Giles slept in the chair beside
Xander's bed.</p>

<p>Buffy came in and on seeing Giles sleeping she smiled at the sight.
His glasses were half way down his nose and a leather book lay in his lap.
Buffy felt a special love for the man who was her Watcher. He had been more
of a father than Hank Summers had ever been. Giles had put his life at risk
more times than she could recall for her. Not only her but all the Scooby
Gang. He would never abandon her, never hurt her, he would die to protect
her. She quietly picked up the book out of his lap. Giles woke with a start.</p>

<p>"Whuh? Huh? Oh. Buffy." He said coming fully awake "Where's Willow?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"She is sleeping in the room next door. Any change in Xander?"</p>

<p>"No, he has been quiet for a few hours. How is Spike?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He left about an hour ago. Said he was tired of being cooped up. I
think he just needs some space to figure out what is happening with his life.
Well, unlife." she amended. The loss of his arm and the conflict of feeling
he had towards the gang was a lot for him to deal with.</p>

<p>"You haven't heard anything from David yet?" she asked him. He just
shook his head. Buffy inwardly raged at David. He pissed her off, he had hurt
her and Willow, and he had put Xander in danger and then run off. But she
held her tongue for Giles sake.</p>

<p>"I take it that you haven't found anything more on this Murg Dor since
last night?" she inquired.</p>

<p>They had found a few things on Murg Dor. Murg Dor was a powerful demon
warlock who had raised an army of vampires to rid the world of humanity. He
and his army was defeated and banished to the ethereal plane by a group of
ultra powerful witches and a small band led by the then Slayer and mysterious
man. Both the Slayer and the man died of the wounds they sustained in the
battle. Murg Dor had powerful magics to conjure demons, slow time, command
vampires, and a host of other things that were not pleasant to read. But they
had not found out how to defeat Murg Dor or why he was after the Slayer and
Scooby Gang. Xander stiffened, signalling another flash back.</p>

<p>"Come on, Will. Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta wake up.
I need you, Will. I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know? And who am I
gonna call every night... and talk about everything we did all day? You're my
best friend. You've always... I love you." Xander said. Willow's voice
sounded from Xander.</p>

<p>"Oz?"</p>

<p>Tears rolled from Xander's sky blue eyes. Silence pervaded the room,
only to be broken by the sound of sniffing coming from the door way. Buffy
and Giles turned to see Willow standing in the door way, she too had tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Willow! Wait!" Buffy called out but Willow ran into her room and
locked the door. Buffy knocked frantically on the door.</p>

<p>"Willow, please let me in. Let's talk about this." Buffy pleaded.
After a few moments Buffy heard the door unlock. Buffy went through and saw
Willow laying on the bed crying. Buffy held her lover and Willow cried in her
lap. Buffy felt helpless to console Willow, a multitude of thoughts and
feelings going through the Slayer. Soon Willow would be willing and able to
talk, but Buffy didn't know what to say to her lover.</p>
