<!-- Moment by Moment \ 9. Homecoming -->

<p>I speed all the way home and almost take out the mailbox pulling into the
driveway, which makes her giggle. </p>
<p>`But Officer, her hand's been on my thigh, rubbing and squeezing since we
left the school parking lot. Would YOU be able to drive slow to get her home?'</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought not.</p>
<p>I have trouble getting out of the car. I'm like, stuck in my seat unable to
move. Sam comes around to my side and helps me out, holding my hand all the way
into the house and then leads me up to my bedroom.</p>
<p>She kisses me gently at first, then with more passion and urgency. I feel
her moist tongue lick my bottom lip and I gladly permit her entrance to my
mouth.</p>
<p>She wastes no time, stroking the inside of my mouth, the roof and my teeth;
teasing my tongue to play with her own. It's a fun duel, slow and sensual
especially as I feel her hands wander under my shirt and up my back. She's
pulling me closer so that we're pressed tightly together in the middle of the
room. I don't think a piece of paper could fit between us now.</p>
<p>She breaks away from my mouth and makes a trail to my ear.</p>
<p>"Show me, Brooke," she growls and I tremble in her arms. "Show me what love
is. Your love."</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>You see, I have this theory about myself. It's a tad embarrassing but then
again, what the hell? I think that below my seemingly innocent, calm exterior,
there lies a beast. A fiery, passionate animal that if properly aroused would
overtake my normal personality and shed all my inhibitions and blow your socks
off. And `she' scares me. I've never let `her' out during sex, no matter how
wild it's gotten. There's a level of trust involved with unleashing `the beast'
that I've yet to find with anyone. I think that someday I might be able to do so
with Sam.</p>
<p>But not tonight. Tonight is our first time together. I want it to be
special, slow and passionate but there's so much I want to show Sammy. To show
her how much I love her and would never hurt her.</p>
<p>"Sammy," I gasp as I nibble on her neck and jaw. My hands are shaking as I
try to unbutton her oversized flannel shirt. She covers my hands with her own
and smiles at me.</p>
<p>"Easy, Brooke," she whispers with so much love in her voice that it break my
heart. No, that's not right. My heart swells with so much happiness it nearly
bursts.</p>
<p>She loves me!</p>
<p>"Let me," she offers and then proceeds to undo the blasted shirt. After she
removes it and tosses it away, I send it a hateful glare. Evil, evil thing. It
kept me from my Sammy.</p>
<p>I may burn it in revenge later. Anyway.</p>
<p>God, she's so beautiful. Her skin is a warm milky color and seems to glow in
the pale sunlight coming in the window behind her. Standing there in her bra,
jeans and sneakers, I doubt that I've seen anything as gorgeous as she is in
this moment.</p>
<p>I kneel before my Goddess to worship her as she deserves to be worshipped.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" I hear her question. I say nothing but unlace her shoes and then
remove them and her socks as she giggles at me.</p>
<p>"Careful, I'm ticklish," she warns. Useful information for later, I think
evilly.</p>
<p>My hands travel up her jeans-clad legs, tracing their sculpting and coming to
rest on her hips. Whether she realizes it or not, she's spread her legs a
little further apart since I initially kneeled. It's incredibly tempting to do
as I want, be as wild with her right now as my blood screams out to be but, the
timing isn't right and I know it. So I place a hot kiss on her groin, over her
clothes and shiver when her moan reaches my ears even as her hands suddenly bury
themselves in my hair.</p>
<p>"Brooooooke," she hisses as she strokes my hair. I look up at her looking
down at me, eyes so full of desire it's amazing and smile.</p>
<p>"Soon, my Sammy," I promise as I unzip her jeans and slide them down over her
legs. She steps out of them and kicks them away as I stand back up, letting my
right hand brush none too lightly against the obvious wet spot on her panties.
With another moan, she pulls me into a heated kiss as she impatiently tries to
pull my shirt off. A loud ripping sound tells me that that shirt is now a rag
with which I will be washing my car.</p>
<p>I discard it as she bites at my bottom lip and rakes her nails against my
back. I may have every intention of being gentle but I think I forgot to tell
Sammy.</p>
<p>I take control again and shove her onto the bed before taking off my own
pants as she watches hungrily. I can feel `the beast' rattling her cage and I
know I'm going to have to fight for control.</p>
<p>Sam reaches around herself and unhooks her bra. Then she shimmies out of her
underwear. I'm frozen as I stare at the vision lying naked on my bed.</p>
<p>"Brooke." she whimpers breathlessly as her back arches and she reaches for
me. I practically rip off my own underwear and stretch my body out over hers.</p>
<p>God, I want to melt right into her forever.</p>
<p>Her hands are everywhere at once; on my back, my breasts, my sides, my ass.
I want her everywhere but this isn't about me. I need to get control of my
hormones.</p>
<p>"Sam," I'm panting as she licks at my collarbone. I'm losing myself in the
feel of her body below mine and I think it's the same for her. The want, the
need and sensations are running away with us. I kiss her hard and slow to calm
her and she relaxes somewhat beneath me.</p>
<p>"Let me." I swallow and try to regain my composure. "Let me show you, Sammy.
Slow and the right way, OK?" She nods, the desire swirling plainly in her eyes
even as her body rocks slowly against mine. I'm on fire and it's delicious.</p>
<p>"Let me know if...if I do something you don't like, OK?" It's important to me
to do everything right because her experience with Nicole was so bad. I wish I
could erase that but since I can't, I'll give her a wonderful memory to
overwrite it with.</p>
<p>"OK," she pants back. There's so much trust in her voice, in her eyes that I
almost want to cry. But, my body has other things in mind.</p>
<p>I put my arms on either side of her head to support myself and put the rest
of my body against hers, sliding my thigh between her slightly parted legs. She
spreads them further apart to accommodate me and then wraps those beautiful
sculpted long limbs around my thigh, pulling me closer to her. I can feel the
moisture of her arousal coating the skin on my leg and my arms nearly give out
as she grinds slowly against me. She's so hot and wet that it nearly overwhelms
me.</p>
<p>I press the hard muscle of my thigh against her wet center and capture her
lips as she moans under me, swallowing the cry and teasing her full lips with my
tongue. I'm controlling the kiss as I caress her tongue with my own, lick her
lips and nibble on her jaw.</p>
<p>Her hands are playing with my breasts in a most delightful torture as I rock
against her. I lick and nip at her ear, listening to the gasps and moans
rolling from her lips as her mouth rests besides my ear.</p>
<p>My arms give out in a very sloppy fashion as Sam raises the thigh I'm
straddling and she grinds it against my own wet flesh.</p>
<p>"God, Sammy." I gasp, the feelings and sensations rolling through my body are
setting my blood on fire.</p>
<p>"I wanted to feel you against me," she growls. The rough sound of her voice
makes `the beast' inside me howl for release.</p>
<p>My next kiss isn't so gentle and I have to fight with myself to calm down no
matter how much it seems Sam liked it.</p>
<p>I bury myself in her neck, kissing and licking as she moves against me, her
actions growing quicker and more needy.</p>
<p>Her breasts are of endless fascination to me. Round and full, soft and
smooth. I find myself occupied by them for a while. First the right nipple,
which I suckle ardently and flick with my tongue, aking her back arch and hands
grasp my hair, and then the left. I repeat the process, don't want anyone to
feel neglected...and then nibble a little. She whimpers and pulls at my hair.</p>
<p>"Sorry." I apologize. </p>
<p>"Broooooke." her whine is pitiful sounding in need. I look up over her
rapidly rising and falling chest to see her flushed face and realize she's
totally gone; given herself over to me.</p>
<p>I let my hand graze lightly over the skin on her inner thigh to gauge her
reaction. She moves against me seeking more contact. I let my fingers play
through her soft hairs, teasing the hidden flesh beneath, eliciting another
whimper.</p>
<p>"Pleeeeeasssssssssse." she begs, her eyes shut and panting heavily.</p>
<p>I slide easily through her warmth, my own eyes fluttering back at the mere
feel of her wetness against my finger. I've experienced other women before, not
many but none have ever been as wet and hot as Sammy is. I'm coated in her in
seconds as I stroke her, seeking out her clit and making her cry out.</p>
<p>"Oh God." One of her hands has flown backwards to grab the headboard as the
other grasps the bed sheets. I watch her beautiful face as I pleasure her by
resting my head on her stomach. Her heartbeat beneath my ear is wild, thumping
against her chest as she undulates against my hand.</p>
<p>I tease her opening with the tip of my index finger and that's when I feel
her freeze; not because of an orgasm but because of fear.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" I ask gently. Her eyes open and focus blearily on mine. She looks
uncertain now and I'm scared I've done something wrong.</p>
<p>"When...with Nic." She's panting and having trouble concentrating.</p>
<p>Wonder why. Giggle</p>
<p>"What about Nic, baby?" I encourage her to talk. OK, so I REALLY don't want
to discuss Nicole right now, but, whatever Sam needs to say, I'll listen.</p>
<p>She bites her lip and sighs.</p>
<p>"It hurt." she whimpers in memory. Oh.</p>
<p>OH!!! Oops...duh.</p>
<p>"I understand, honey," I soothe, moving up slightly to kiss her. Now I'm
lying next to her looking her in the eyes. "When Nicole...it always hurts the
first time or so, Sammy. I'm sorry that she wasn't gentle with you. She should
have been, especially for your first time. I won't do that if you're not ready,
OK?"</p>
<p>She looks thoughtful for a minute and then gives me a smoldering look that I
swear could set a forest fire in Antarctica.</p>
<p>"I want you inside me, Brooke." she whispers huskily. </p>
<p>I nearly cum just at her words. Damn, how does she DO that?</p>
<p>"If it hurts, tell me, I'll stop," I promise and she nods. "I'd never hurt
you."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>I begin moving my hand again and after a few minutes, slip inside her tight
channel. God, she clamped down on me instantly and so tightly it almost hurts.
She stopped moving for a second and I'm worried.</p>
<p>"Sammy.?"</p>
<p>"Mmmmmmmmm, God, don't stop, feels good." she moans wantonly. I smile and
start circling her clit with my thumb, doubling the sensations as I move my
finger inside her, stroking as deep as I can and then pulling out slightly.</p>
<p>She's soaking my hand in her moisture again as she mumbles and whimpers
incoherently, moving faster against my hand and crying out for more.</p>
<p>"More, Brooke, deeper," she growls. I'm careful as I slip another finger in
to join the first. I don't want to stretch her too much and inadvertently cause
her pain.</p>
<p>"Oh God Yes!" Her head is thrown back, her back is arched and she's covered
in a fine sheen of sweat making her glow as she bucks against me trying to reach
her release. I swirl my tongue around her nipple again and begin to suckle and
bite at it as I curl my fingers upward inside her.</p>
<p>And she explodes.</p>
<p>She screams as the orgasm slams into her like an ocean wave, robbing her of
all control as she convulses against my hand and fills it with her pleasure.
Her orgasm seems endless as it crushes my fingers and it further intensifies the
ache between my own legs. I'm still riding her thigh and almost there.</p>
<p>My desire...need for release is so sharp it hurts.</p>
<p>Its sharp edges are digging into my abdomen as I feel my own orgasm teasing
me at the edges of my reach.</p>
<p>As if reading my thoughts, Sam, still panting, raises her thigh as just I
thrust downward. My sudden orgasm coats her thigh as I collapse against her
shaking.</p>
<p>It's a few minutes before either of us move. And `the beast' isn't
satisfied. Oh, `she's' happy, but there's one more thing `she' wants.</p>
<p>And I decide to give in.</p>
<p>I move down Sam's prone body, settling myself between her still trembling
thighs. Her head raises slightly, hooded eyes regarding me questioningly.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Her voice is hoarse and low. "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>My smirk must be rather devilish because her eyes spark suddenly with desire.</p>
<p>"Why, Sammy, I'm going to lick you clean," I announce saucily before diving
in before she can respond. Her response is to bury her hands in my hair and
push me closer into her.</p>
<p>Mmmmmmmmmm...yummy. She's sweet, with this slight salty tang that makes my
tongue tingle. I lick up every drop of wetness I can find but she only replaces
it as fast as I work.</p>
<p>Hmmm...gotta work harder.</p>
<p>I slip my tongue inside her and repeat the earlier actions of my fingers
while my nose rubs against her clit. She's nearly pulling out my hair as she
rides my face. My name...MY NAME is flowing constantly from her lips.</p>
<p>She traps my tongue inside her as she cums this time and I nearly drown in
her flowing juices as I try to drink it all down. I don't want to miss a drop.</p>
<p>Oh my sweet sweet Sammy.</p>
<p>After she returns from bliss, she pulls me up beside her and wraps herself
around me like a human blanket. I can tell she's tired.</p>
<p>"I'm going to repay that," she whispers sleepy as her eyes droop shut and she
buries her head in the crook of my neck. "Right after my nap." And she's out.</p>
<p>That's OK. I can wait. Sammy loves me and we have all the time in the world
for paybacks.</p>
