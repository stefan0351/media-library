<p><b>A/N:</b> Because you know Puck totally would.</p>
<p><b>Truth or Dare</b></p>
<p>"I'll put the game away," Finn said, folding it up.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Noah, why don't you start us off?" Rachel asked, sitting between Tina and the arm of the couch.</p>
<p>"I thought you wanted to—"</p>
<p>"He can never think of questions," Santana interrupted, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>"Then why did you suggest it?" Mercedes asked.</p>
<p>"Because it's <i>awesome</i>."</p>
<p>"Well, you suggested it, so you start it," Rachel ordered.</p>
<p>"Bu—"</p>
<p>"<i>Now</i>."</p>
<p>"Santana."</p>
<p>"Dare," she said smugly.</p>
<p>"Umm…."</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"This is the most boring game of Truth or Dare ever," Kurt commented, yawning.</p>
<p>"I don't think Puck should've started us off," Artie agreed.</p>
<p>"Shut up! I'm thinking."</p>
<p>"You've been thinking for fifteen minutes. Come up with something already, dude," Matt said.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay. Fine. Santana, I dare you to…eat the turkey I saw in Rachel's fridge with any condiments you can find in there," he said, nodding. "And if you throw up afterward, it doesn't count."</p>
<p>"You have turkey?" Finn asked, frowning.</p>
<p>"It's my dad's. And a week old," she said.</p>
<p>Santana left, and they heard the microwave.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you let Quinn win," Tina said eventually.</p>
<p>"She didn't win the Twister game," Rachel said, confused.</p>
<p>"I mean the musical chair thing."</p>
<p>She turned red. "Oh. Well…I-I was getting bored of that game. Besides, winning isn't everything."</p>
<p>Quinn smirked. The rest of them gaped. Santana came back with her plate of ketchup-covered turkey and they all watched in disgust as she wolfed it down. She burped.</p>
<p>"Okay, Brit," she said.</p>
<p>"How did you <i>do</i> that? That was so gross," Mercedes commented, grimacing.</p>
<p>"When you live on Coach Sylvester's diet, you learn to repress your gag reflex."</p>
<p>"Dare!" Brittany said excitedly.</p>
<p>"I dare you to go without panties for the rest of the party."</p>
<p>"Sweet!" Puck exclaimed, and Brittany went off to the bathroom.</p>
<p>"I don't think I'm going with dare this game," Tina said timidly.</p>
<p>Artie patted her. "Don't worry. None of us could be that cruel to you."</p>
<p>She smiled. Brittany plopped next to Santana, smiling.</p>
<p>"Mike."</p>
<p>"Oh…truth," he said, shrugging.</p>
<p>"Wuss," Matt said. "OW! Why does everyone keep hitting tonight?"</p>
<p>"The girls did it first," Mike pointed out.</p>
<p>"But they're girls. They—"</p>
<p>"Matt, I'm going to stop you right there before you say something completely chauvinistic for which you will have to be flogged and punished," Rachel said icily.</p>
<p>He paled.</p>
<p>Brittany huffed. "Excuse me? Okay, what is the worst nightmare you have ever had?"</p>
<p>Mike frowned. "Consequences?"</p>
<p>"You have to…kiss Finn."</p>
<p>There was a collective "ew," and Finn shifted away from her.</p>
<p>"Okay, the worst nightmare was…what you just said." Mike grinned. "Just kidding, it's actually that I'm in this really dark, empty warehouse, and this crazy vampire clown with an axe is chasing me."</p>
<p>"Poor Mike," Tina empathized.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but the worst part is when I run into the bathroom and Figgins is in the bathtub."</p>
<p>They all flinched.</p>
<p>"Dude, that <i>is</i> bad," Puck agreed, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"I know. Okay, so…who hasn't gone? Mercedes?"</p>
<p>"Oh, what the heck? Dare."</p>
<p>"Okay, I dare you to…Kurt, cover your ears."</p>
<p>He frowned. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Just do it, dude."</p>
<p>Kurt pouted, but obeyed. Mercedes frowned apprehensively.</p>
<p>"I dare you to steal his daily moisturizer," Mike said solemnly. "I saw it in his sleeping bag when he came in."</p>
<p>She gasped. "I couldn't! Consequences!"</p>
<p>"Steal Rachel's Celine Dion CD."</p>
<p>Rachel squeaked indignantly and Mercedes got up to grab the moisturizer from Kurt's sleeping bag.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Hey, that's mine!" he yelped, grabbing for it.</p>
<p>"He dared me to," Mercedes said accusingly.</p>
<p>Kurt was aghast. "Shame on you! Shame on both of you! You should be ashamed of yourselves." And he shook his head.</p>
<p>"Actually…your reaction is making it fun," she replied, grinning. He glared at her. "Okay, Matt."</p>
<p>"Dare," he said, bouncing.</p>
<p>"Hmmm…okay, I've got it. Find Rachel's oldest CD with <i>the</i> weirdest song and do an interpretive dance to it wearing only your boxers and shirt."</p>
<p>"Dude, sweet!" Puck said, reaching to high-five her.</p>
<p>"That's awesome," Finn agreed, and Mercedes smiled, pleased with herself.</p>
<p>Matt paled. "Um…consequences?"</p>
<p>"Oh, come on. Be a man," Santana growled.</p>
<p>He bolted up the stairs.</p>
<p>"Don't move anything!" Rachel yelled after him.</p>
<p>Matt returned and shucked off his jeans, stuck the CD in, and skipped to the song '<i>Love Shack</i>.' The girls cat-called and wolf-whistled and sang along from the sidelines while he danced; the guys howled with laughter.</p>
<p>When he finished dancing in slow-mo, he sat and said sagely, "I am not gay."</p>
<p>Mike patted him.</p>
<p>"Good God, don't anyone tell Mr. Schue about that," Puck said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Why?" Tina asked.</p>
<p>"He'll make us <i>do</i> it. Don't think I've forgotten about the disco incident."</p>
<p>"You weren't even there when that happened," Rachel pointed out.</p>
<p>"But I had to hear Finn whining and moaning about it, and that's enough torture for me."</p>
<p>"Hey!" Finn exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Can I pick someone now?" Matt asked. "All right…how about Artie?"</p>
<p>"As I think any dares could be detrimental to my wheelchair's health, truth," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh. Uh…who is <i>your</i> favorite superhero?"</p>
<p>"Lame," Puck coughed.</p>
<p>"Green Lantern. Tina?"</p>
<p>"Truth," she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"How many boys have you kissed?" he asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>She laughed and pecked him on the lips. "One."</p>
<p>He smiled, satisfied.</p>
<p>"Okay…Kurt?"</p>
<p>He grinned. "Dare."</p>
<p>"Oh. Ummm…I dare you to…I can't think of anything."</p>
<p>Puck swiftly whispered in her ear and she blushed.</p>
<p>"I-I appreciate the suggestion, but—"</p>
<p>Rachel whispered in her ear from the other side.</p>
<p>"Oh. Okay, Kurt, I dare you to mess up your hair and leave it that way until the end of this game," Tina said mischievously.</p>
<p>He gaped, then glared, then slowly mussed it up, with the hasty help of everyone sitting in his vicinity. Then he folded his arms and pouted.</p>
<p>"I hate you both."</p>
<p>Tina frowned sadly and Rachel patted her.</p>
<p>"Okay, Rachel," Kurt said, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>"Truth."</p>
<p>"Excellent. Why did you let Quinn win?"</p>
<p>Quinn perked up and Rachel shifted nervously.</p>
<p>"…Consequences?"</p>
<p>"Fry and eat an egg."</p>
<p>She squeaked incoherently and Tina rubbed her arm comfortingly.</p>
<p>"Fine. Bastard," Rachel muttered, then said louder, "I…decided that…my butt hurt. From the chair."</p>
<p>Kurt rolled his eyes. "Total lie. Go get the egg or I—"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, fine!" She huffed and folded her arms, pouting. "I hate you."</p>
<p>"I know. It's okay."</p>
<p>"She was giving me a massage because my back hurt. And she…accidentally touched a…certain favorite area of mine…that was mentioned. Earlier this evening."</p>
<p>Finn glowered; Quinn smirked; Rachel squirmed uncomfortably. And Kurt grinned smugly.</p>
<p>"Okay, so Finn," she said brightly.</p>
<p>"Uh…truth."</p>
<p>"Wuss," Puck said.</p>
<p>"I have put up with a lot of crap tonight, and I think I've proved my manliness," Finn growled. "Truth."</p>
<p>"How many girlfriends have you had?" she asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Uh…I…consequences?"</p>
<p>"As I said, wuss."</p>
<p>"You have to sing '<i>I Feel Pretty</i>' in falsetto, while wearing makeup," Rachel said simply.</p>
<p>"Damn!" Mercedes exclaimed, grinning. "Go, hot mama!"</p>
<p>"You are <i>good</i>," Artie agreed, and Rachel grinned.</p>
<p>"Oh. Well, um…three officially," Finn said, clearing his throat.</p>
<p>"What about Santana and Brittany?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"They weren't, um…technically they were dates," he replied awkwardly.</p>
<p>"Or, in Santana's case, a one night stand," Puck said, exchanging a grin with Mike.</p>
<p>Rachel frowned. "But they didn't have—"</p>
<p>Santana was shaking her head. Rachel stiffened, refusing to look at Finn.</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>"But it didn't mean anything!" Finn exclaimed. "I swear, it really didn't, I was just—"</p>
<p>"Would you please address Quinn? She's the only one who hasn't gone yet, I believe," Rachel said curtly.</p>
<p>Finn drooped and turned to Quinn, who grinned at him. He glared.</p>
<p>"Okay…Quinn?"</p>
<p>"Oh…dare," she said, shrugging.</p>
<p>He folded his arms. "I dare you to admit why you know so much about Rachel."</p>
<p>She sighed and rolled her eyes. "Because I <i>listen</i>. When. She. Talks. Can you get a grip and <i>move on</i>?"</p>
<p>"Please," Santana agreed, nodding.</p>
<p>"It's just sad, man," Puck added.</p>
<p>Finn promptly pouted.</p>
<p>"Well, that was pretty fun," Matt said. "Except for the traumatizing parts."</p>
<p>"Quinn didn't get to dare anyone, though," Mercedes pointed out. "Shouldn't she get a turn?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mercedes."</p>
<p>"No problem, girl."</p>
<p>"Rachel."</p>
<p>"Huh? Uh…truth?"</p>
<p>"What weren't you telling me during Twister?" Quinn asked, smirking.</p>
<p>Rachel squirmed. "Consequences?"</p>
<p>"Donate more of your panties to the I'm Desperate For Rachel Berry JewFro club."</p>
<p>"I think they prefer being called I'm Deaf," Santana quipped.</p>
<p>"Can I at least whisper it to you?" Rachel asked uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"I think I can allow that."</p>
<p>The brunette sank next to her and cupped her ear to whisper. Everyone leaned in, trying to hear as Quinn's smirk grew.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"Before I tell you this, I am <i>begging</i> you not to make a snide comment, because I honestly don't think I could handle that from you right now." She sighed. "I was going to say that I didn't mind it with Finn because with him that position isn't arousing, as he does not stir those feelings in me when we make out, let alone when sex is referenced."</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>Everyone was pouting when Rachel pulled back and frowned at Quinn.</p>
<p>"Are you happy now?" she grumped.</p>
<p>Quinn grinned. "Very."</p>
<p>Rachel folded her arms while the rest of them waited, and Kurt huffed first.</p>
<p>"Rachel, you have to go next," he reminded her.</p>
<p>"Ah, right." She frowned in thought, then narrowed her eyes at Quinn. "Quinn."</p>
<p>"Truth."</p>
<p>"What really happened in the hospital when you found out what I do with my soap scents?" she challenged.</p>
<p>Quinn glared and Rachel raised her chin.</p>
<p>"I'm whispering it in your ear," she said flatly.</p>
<p>"Fine with me."</p>
<p>The blonde leaned and the rest of them huffed.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"I didn't have to sit with you. Everyone went to the cafeteria; I stayed with you claiming I wasn't hungry. You came to and asked what happened, I explained that you passed out, you asked me to sit with you, I did, I told you that you smelled amazing, you explained what you do, and then you went back to sleep. End of story."</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"Happy?"</p>
<p>"I would've preferred the utilization of a less deprecating tone in your description, but yes, happy."</p>
<p>"Your turn, Quinn," Matt said, glancing at the others.</p>
<p>They waited on the edge of their seats while Quinn frowned at Rachel.</p>
<p>"Rachel."</p>
<p>They sighed.</p>
<p>"Truth."</p>
<p>"Did you really sleep with Jesse St. James?"</p>
<p>"Of course she did," Finn blurted, scowling.</p>
<p>Quinn waited and Rachel shifted before mumbling, "No."</p>
<p>"You lied to me?" he gasped.</p>
<p>"You lied to me! And yours was much worse!" she snapped immediately. "At least I still <i>have</i> my virginity!"</p>
<p>He grumbled and drooped again, sulking in his armchair.</p>
<p>"Quinn," Rachel snapped.</p>
<p>"This is rapidly turning into a two-person game," Kurt observed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, can someone else please have a turn?" Santana growled. "Your lover's spat is boring."</p>
<p>"It's hot," Puck disagreed.</p>
<p>Rachel turned purple. "It's not a—"</p>
<p>"Pick. Someone. Else."</p>
<p>She glared. "Fine. Artie."</p>
<p>"I'll go with truth again," he said timidly.</p>
<p>"All right, um…how many…girls have <i>you</i> kissed?" she asked, shrugging disinterestedly.</p>
<p>Tina perked up and Artie flushed red.</p>
<p>"Uh…just two. Okay, San—"</p>
<p>"Wait. Who else have you kissed?" Tina asked, pouting.</p>
<p>"Well…Brittany," he admitted sheepishly. "She caught me off-guard!"</p>
<p>"I had to maintain my perfect record," Brittany explained. "But it was before you guys dated. And he told me he liked you. So I gave him practice."</p>
<p>Tina was still drooping, but she seemed placated when Artie patted her.</p>
<p>"Brittany, does that mean you've kissed everyone in this room?" Mercedes asked curiously. "I mean, except me, because I know you haven't done that."</p>
<p>"Let's see…." Brittany ran her gaze over the group. "Everyone but you four." And she pointed to Quinn, Rachel, Tina, and Mercedes.</p>
<p>"That's a little disturbing," Artie pointed out.</p>
<p>"So? I've kissed all but six," Santana said, shrugging.</p>
<p>"I've got one of you girls to go," Puck added, winking at Tina, who Artie guarded.</p>
<p>"And how many of the guys?" Quinn asked.</p>
<p>He glared. "How about you, Quinn?"</p>
<p>"You know the two people in this room I've kissed. You being one of them."</p>
<p>"Hey, we've both kissed the same people," Rachel said suddenly.</p>
<p>"You just realized this?" Kurt asked, shaking his head.</p>
<p>She blushed. "Well, I never really thought about the fact that Noah actually kissed her in order to get her pregnant."</p>
<p>"I didn't. I—"</p>
<p>"That means you guys have practically made out," Brittany interrupted, eliciting a sigh of relief from everyone.</p>
<p>"Who has?" Santana asked gently.</p>
<p>"Quinn and Rachel."</p>
<p>The former smirked; the latter squirmed.</p>
<p>"So, Artie, you were going to ask me. Dare," Santana said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"I dare you to…sing '<i>Marian the Librarian</i>' to…Tina. With a straight face," he said, grinning.</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes with a scoff. "Easy."</p>
<p>She kneeled in front of Tina, who immediately started giggling, and cleared her throat before belting out the first verse. Tina giggled through the whole thing and everyone else was snickering, but Santana never even cracked a smile. Though they did fear it was going to happen during the part about the moonlight helping along.</p>
<p>Santana plopped next to Brittany when she was finished. The blonde guarded her from Tina, who she momentarily glared at.</p>
<p>"See? Easy. Okay, B, your turn."</p>
<p>"Dare!"</p>
<p>"I dare you to show everyone that routine you memorized."</p>
<p>Everyone frowned in confusion, but Brittany frowned.</p>
<p>"But San…" she whined.</p>
<p>"No buts."</p>
<p>Brittany sighed and whispered in Rachel's ear. The brunette giggled and ran up the stairs, popping in a CD when she returned. Brittany took center stage and proceeded to duplicate the entirety of the girl's choreography from '<i>Push It</i>.' Everyone was in stitches by the end, and no one spoke for several minutes because they were laughing too hard.</p>
<p>"Is it my turn to ask yet?" Brittany whispered to Santana, after about two minutes.</p>
<p>She nodded, smirking.</p>
<p>"Puck," she said delightedly.</p>
<p>"Dare," he replied.</p>
<p>"Go sing to one of Rachel's neighbors."</p>
<p>"Uh…okay. Can I do it after the game?"</p>
<p>"No. You have to go, with your guitar, and sing them that song you sang to Mercedes. And you can't tell them you did it on a dare."</p>
<p>Santana grinned proudly and Puck sighed, grabbed his guitar, and headed for the door.</p>
<p>"I'll go to make sure he actually does it," Matt said, hopping up.</p>
<p>They all ran to the front door, cramming in to peer out of it as Puck walked up to a door and knocked, wincing the entire time. Matt shoved him back onto the step when he tried to walk away, and they all giggled when Puck raised his guitar and started belting it.</p>
<p>They were cackling when the two boys ran for the front porch and dove inside, panting.</p>
<p>"They threatened with the police!" Puck gasped, and they all burst into fresh gales as they plopped into their seats. "It's not funny!"</p>
<p>"Your neighbors are <i>cranky</i>, Berry," Matt commented.</p>
<p>"We almost got arrested!"</p>
<p>"You did not. They threaten to call the police all the time, but they never do," Rachel replied, shaking her head.</p>
<p>When everyone stared, she frowned.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You do that all the time, then?" Santana asked, arching a brow.</p>
<p>"Oh! No, I just happen to have a very wide vocal range and, at times—"</p>
<p>"Gotcha."</p>
<p>Puck sighed and flopped to the floor next to Finn, who was back to pouting in his armchair.</p>
<p>"Dude…so not cool."</p>
<p>"You have to pick someone," Brittany said insistently.</p>
<p>"Gah…fine, Rachel?"</p>
<p>"I think I'll go with a dare this time," she said, smiling.</p>
<p>"You are a brave one," Kurt said in a pseudo-Yoda voice.</p>
<p>She grinned.</p>
<p>"Umm…."</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
<p>"I have <i>so</i> got it!"</p>
<p>Everyone jumped and Santana groaned.</p>
<p>"No, you don't."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do! This is perfect, all right?" Puck said, grinning.</p>
<p>"Are you going to tell me so I can ask for consequences?" Rachel asked.</p>
<p>"You won't need to." He snickered. "I dare you to kiss Quinn. With tongue."</p>
<p>Both girls shot up, one suddenly smiling. Finn stared at his best friend with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Noah, why do you want to hurt me?" Rachel demanded, aghast.</p>
<p>He frowned. "Huh?"</p>
<p>"I refuse to participate in a dare that will result in personal injury, particularly to my nasal area," she retorted, folding her arms haughtily. "Give me your consequences."</p>
<p>"Go streaking in the park."</p>
<p>Her jaw dropped. "Noah!"</p>
<p>"Well? You either give me a lesbian kiss or get naked," he said, shrugging.</p>
<p>"Well…y-you're…." She flapped her mouth open and shut, trying to formulate words. "Your dare is against the rules!"</p>
<p>"It is not," he said, affronted.</p>
<p>"It is, too! Technically, by daring me to successfully make contact with her, you are daring Quinn to let me. Therefore, she has the right to veto the dare if she wishes," Rachel said superiorly, and turned to the blonde expectantly.</p>
<p>Before Puck could ask, Quinn waved her hand dismissively.</p>
<p>"I pass up on my right this time."</p>
<p>The brunette gaped. "You do?"</p>
<p>She grinned. "Hell, I just want to see if you can stomach it."</p>
<p>Rachel scowled. "That's certainly incentive," she grumbled, then turned back to Puck. "Doesn't Finn have a right to veto? He is my boyfriend after all, and he should be able to protest to a dare that would basically constitute as cheating."</p>
<p>Finn rose up to do just that, but Puck shook his head.</p>
<p>"Nope. Meathead doesn't get a choice in the matter. It's up to you, Berry. Kiss Quinn, or run naked."</p>
<p>The rest of them watched on interestedly, and Santana grinned when Brittany bounced.</p>
<p>"Kiss, kiss!" she mock-whispered excitedly.</p>
<p>And everyone followed suit with a chant, except for Finn and Quinn, one of whom was fuming. Rachel squirmed uncomfortably, glancing uncertainly at Quinn before she finally bellowed, "All right!" and put a stop to the chanting.</p>
<p>She sighed and shifted toward the blonde, but paused. They all groaned.</p>
<p>"Does everyone have to be watching?" she mewled.</p>
<p>"Aw, you got performance anxiety?" Santana taunted.</p>
<p>"Oh, she just doesn't want anyone to see her doing something so vile," Kurt said with a shrug.</p>
<p>"Hey! I do not find the prospect of kissing an attractive girl such as Quinn disgusting!" Rachel snapped, and Quinn perked up a little. "I merely find it difficult to believe that I will not be receiving a black eye when I do so."</p>
<p>"God, you are <i>such</i> an idiot," Santana moaned, and Brittany nodded sagely in agreement.</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes at them. "<i>Besides</i>, making out is not something I like to do with an audience, particularly not in front of my boyfriend, even if I am angry with him."</p>
<p>"You just think it's gross," Kurt said again, and Mercedes caught on.</p>
<p>"Not that we can blame you. It would kind of be like kissing JewFro," she teased, winking at Quinn.</p>
<p>Rachel bristled. "Do not compare Quinn to that insipid little cretin! It's not even possible! How can you possibly think his slimy, sticky, grabby hands measure up to hers? And her hair is <i>nothing</i> if not gorgeous, particularly when its down and in those adorable curls! And another thing!"</p>
<p>Quinn was grinning by now, and Finn was frowning in deep confusion.</p>
<p>"So you're saying she's not ugly?" Artie asked, amused.</p>
<p>Rachel gasped. "Of <i>course</i> not! She's <i>beautiful</i>!"</p>
<p>"Prove it," Puck said, without missing a beat.</p>
<p>And Rachel fumed, seized Quinn by the back of the neck, and kissed her.</p>
<p>XXXXXX</p>
