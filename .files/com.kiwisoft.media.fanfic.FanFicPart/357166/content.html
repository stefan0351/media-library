<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 16: Switching - Part 2-->

<p>The demon, Balthazar, was extremely overweight, with very pale, slimy skin. He sat in a tank of dirty water, while one of the Eliminati poured some of the water over him trying to keep his skin moist. </P>
<P>&quot;Let me tell you what I see.&quot; He told his followers. &quot;I see fear... and remorse... and the pitiful look of faces that cry out for mercy! But what I don't see is what I want to see, and that's... my... amulet!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lord Balthazar, we found it! We had it! But the Slayers...&quot; Said a vampire.</P>
<P>&quot;Already I'm bored.&quot;</P>
<P>He held out his hands, and instantly a sort of ‘magnet effect’ was distorting the air. The vampire floated over to Balthazar, who grabbed his throat and squeezed until his neck broke and he slumped to the floor. Vincent watched, extremely worried.</P>
<P>&quot;Vincent... Come here.&quot; He wheezed as Vincent approached. &quot;Closer.&quot;</P>
<P>Vincent leaned toward him. &quot;Closer.&quot; </P>
<P>He leaned even closer, and Balthazar put his hands on Vincent's shoulders. </P>
<P>&quot;Let me tell you… what I want to see.&quot;</P>

<p>In the library, Giles was studying the amulet Buffy had given him when she came to school. Wesley was sitting in the cage, quiet. Then, with a look of apology on his face, he stood up, and addressed Giles.</P>
<p>&quot;There’s something I must tell you.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;I have plenty information on the amulet, thank you.&quot; Giles responded curtly.</P>
<p>&quot;It’s not about that…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Go on.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;It seems I have made a miscalculation.&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In chemistry class, Mrs. Taggart passed out the exam booklets. Buffy was sitting next to Willow at their table by the window. She was twisted around in her seat talking quietly to Willow, Xander, and Cordelia. </P>
<P>&quot;It was intense. It was like I just... let go and became this force. I just didn't care anymore.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, I know what that's like.&quot; Willow responded.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think you can. It's kind of a Slayer thing. I don't even think I'm explaining it well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're explaining it a lot, though.&quot; Xander said.</P>
<P>&quot;Did something happen during patrol last night?&quot; Willow asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing out of the usual. Why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You’ve never seemed to enjoy slaying this much before.&quot;</P>
<P>Mrs. Taggart handed the four of them their tests.  &quot;Alright. You have one period to fill out your test booklets. Periodic charts are located on the back. You're on the honor system, so remember, no talking.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy started talking again. &quot;You see, the thing was –&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ahem. Ms. Summers?&quot; Mrs. Taggert said. &quot;You have one hour.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy turned to her test, and as soon as the teacher had her back turned, she talked again. &quot;Okay, so the best part...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy. Test? You know. Remember? The thing you didn't come over to study for?&quot; Willow explained, worry and hurt in her voice.</P>
<P>&quot;Right. Got it.&quot; She went back to her test, but then began again. &quot;Sorry. Okay, so we're down there, in the sewers…I mean, me…and…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;God, Buffy shut up.&quot; Cordelia hissed.</P>
<P>Buffy realized that she wasn’t going to be allowed to continue her story, and calmed down to take her test. She opened the booklet, but was interrupted, along with the rest of the class, by Faith rapping on the windowpane trying to get Buffy's attention. Faith lifted the sash and leaned in.</P>
<P>&quot;Hey. Bad time?&quot; Faith asked.</P>
<P>She leaned over to the next window, wiped the dust from it with her sleeve, exhaled to fog it and used her index fingers to draw a heart with a stake through it. She looked at Buffy, smiled and raised her eyebrows. Buffy slid down from her lab stool and headed for the window. </P>
<P>&quot;No, she can't! You can't! Can you?&quot; Willow asked, not believing what was happening.</P>
<P>Buffy regarded her for a moment, and climbed out of the window. Faith lowered the sash. </P>
<P>&quot;What's up?&quot; Buffy asked. They were walking outside now.</P>
<P>&quot;Vampires.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Uh, Faith, unless there's a total eclipse in the next five minutes, its daylight.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good for us, bad for them. Found a nest. Don’t know if it’s our boys, but they’re still vampires.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has potential.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;How is everyone?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;You mean you care?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Not really, but…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Willow’s all excited about getting accepted to every college on the planet. She’s probably gonna…&quot; Buffy looked sad for a second, and then shrugged it off. &quot;Forget it. Where’s the nest?&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the nest, it was dark and musty. Only a few rays of sunlight were getting in. There were vampires lying all over the floor. Buffy and Faith kicked in the door, and the sunlight poured in. It hit one of the vampires, and it quickly burst into flames. They all scrambled to their feet and began to run. </P>
<P>&quot;Rise and shine, people.&quot; Faith said.</P>
<P>&quot;It's your wake-up call.&quot; Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In City Hall, the Mayor posed with a troop of Boy Scouts. They all had smiles on their faces. The photographer snapped the picture.</P>
<P>&quot;There we go.&quot; He said, as the boys went out of the office. &quot;Thanks a lot, fellas. Thanks a heap.&quot;</P>
<P>He went to the window, where the blinds were open, and started to shut them.</P>
<P>&quot;Hey, have fun on that camping trip, now. Don't forget to roast a wiener for me.&quot;</P>
<p>As the last kid left, the Mayor walked to the door of his private bathroom.</P>
<P>&quot;Here we go. Alright, you can come out now.&quot;  Mr. Trick came into the office. &quot;Backbone of America, those little guys. Seeing the hope and courage on their bright little faces, I swear I could just, I... I could just eat 'em up.&quot; </P>
<P>He walked over to the liquor cabinet, and started to open it up. &quot;So, any news about the Eliminati?&quot;</P>
<P>Vincent jumped out and grabbed him by the neck, pushing him back and down over his desk and held up his sword to attack.</P>
<P>&quot;In the name of Lord Balthazar, die!&quot;</P>
<P>Before he could do anything, Mr. Trick punched him in the forehead. Vincent fell backward onto the floor, unconscious. The Mayor coughed as he sat up on the edge of the desk and straightened his tie.</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Trick. That was very thoughtful of you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why do they always gotta be using swords? It's called an Uzi, chump! Could have saved your ass right about now.&quot; Trick said to Vincent’s still form.</P>
<P>&quot;You know, it's curious how he could've gotten all the way into my liquor cabinet.&quot; The Mayor looked at Allan who was standing in the corner. &quot;Allan, don't we have security working in this building?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, I... I had no idea. I...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no need to swoon, Allan. But try to keep things secure. Lock him up.&quot; The Mayor looked at Vincent. </P>
<P>&quot;He wakes up, he's just gonna try and kill you again.&quot; Trick said.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I expect he will.&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the library, Wesley was now telling everyone, except Buffy, about his ‘miscalculation’.</P>
<P>&quot;Her story seemed to fit with what I’d been told about…all of you…she was quite inviting…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Council didn’t tell you that Faith was the bad one?&quot; Willow asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith has…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Been informally discharged, in the mildest sense. Am I correct?&quot; Giles asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. To be quite frank, the Council did not take your warnings about Faith at face value. Nor did I, when I was told.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You thought he was making it up?&quot; Xander asked.</P>
<P>&quot;It doesn’t matter now. What matters is…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That you let Faith trick Buffy, and now…&quot; Willow trailed off.</P>
<P>&quot;Who knows what ideas she’s been planting in her head.&quot; Giles said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, at night, Buffy and Willow were sitting on Buffy’s bed. Willow handed her a small black pouch, and she smelled its contents.</P>
<P>&quot;You like it?&quot; Willow asked.</P>
<P>&quot;It smells good. What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Just a little something we witches like to call a protection spell.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good deal, protection. I'm surprised, though, 'cause usually spell stuff's more...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stinky. Yeah. That's why I added lavender. Give me time, and I may be the first wicca to do all my conjuring in pine fresh scent. So what's the plan?&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy gave her a questioning look.</P>
<P>&quot;For tonight's slayage. We're going, aren't we?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Buffy looked down at the bag, trying to see if she could see the individual fibers. Avoiding wasn’t her best talent.</P>
<p>&quot;Out with it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But... there's a 'but'. And that's 'but you shouldn't come... tonight.' Is that cool?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, sure. Makes sense. You know... You'll be facing big, hairy danger.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Uh, biggest and very hairy. Found the Elimanti’s place. Wouldn’t want you to get hurt…or anything…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You'll be risking your life.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Right. And why risk yours?&quot;</P>
<P>Willow glanced down at the bed. &quot;Because I'm your friend?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because I love you, and that's exactly why I don't want you going. It's too dangerous.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I've done this sort of thing before! Like, a million times, and I can totally handle myself. Besides, minty fresh protection. So?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;It’s…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;It’s Faith. I know who it is. You’re just trying to hide that’s who you’re slaying with. The enemy.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She’s not…I just think maybe if I hang with her…she’ll come back to the side of good. She just needs someone to push her in the right direction.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She’s the one doing the pushing, Buffy. Wesley said…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Wesley? The guy who tried to cart me off to England and kill me Wesley?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Faith set him up. She tricked him, and…now she’s tricking you.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She saved me. Don’t you trust me?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Always, you just haven’t been yourself, and Faith seems to be in the middle of it all.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She isn’t doing anything to me. Look, I have to go.&quot; Buffy walked out of the room, angry.</P>
<p>Willow looked out Buffy’s window, and saw Faith standing on the sidewalk.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Inside Balthazar’s warehouse, a vampire was pouring more water on his boss.</P>
<P>&quot;Vincent made a noble effort. Man to man, as befits a true warrior. He had courage... He had honor... and I have jack to show for it! </P>
<P>&quot;It’s been a hundred years since my enemy crippled me. Now ultimate power is within his grasp. And I shall not let it be! Forget about honor! Forget about everything! But getting my amulet! Bring the Watchers to me! Find the Slayers and kill them! Kill everything that gets in your way! Go! Go!&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Faith and Buffy looked for the warehouse and found it. They looked in through a crack in the door and saw Balthazar surrounded by the Eliminati. His men started exiting.</P>
<p>Buffy and Faith stood flat against the wall, making sure they weren’t seen.</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, we got ten, maybe twelve bad guys and one big demon in desperate need of a Stairmaster.&quot; Buffy said.</P>
<P>&quot;I say we take 'em all, hard and fast and now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We need a little more firepower than none. I should…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I guess Jacuzzi Boy isn't going anywhere. I just... wish we had...&quot;</P>
<P>Faith spotted a sport and tackle shop across the street. She pointed Buffy in that direction.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. That is too good.&quot; She said, heading for the store. Buffy was following.</P>
<P>The got to the front door and Faith kicked it in. They walked through quickly, looking for anything useful. Faith found the Archery counter.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. Score.&quot;</P>
<P>She saw a small crossbow, complete with 4x optical sights, on display beneath the glass countertop. She broke the glass with her elbow, reached in, and pulled it out.</P>
<P>&quot;Think they're insured?&quot; Buffy asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Strangely, not my priority. When are ya gonna get this, B? Life for a Slayer is very simple.&quot; She walked to a case, broke it, and pulled out a pair of nun-chucks. &quot;Want...take…have.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy hesitated, but saw hunting knives in another case. </P>
<P>&quot;Want...take...have.&quot; Buffy repeated. She punched the glass with her fist, and grabbed a dagger out of the case. &quot;I'm gettin' it.&quot;</P>
<P>Faith smiled, seeing that Buffy was finally coming around. Before they could get any further, they were surprised by a gunshot. They spun around to see two police officers. They both had service revolvers aimed at them.</P>
<p>&quot;Drop the weapons and get down on the ground! Now!&quot; One officer said.</P>
<p>They didn’t move.</P>
<P>&quot;I said drop the weapons, or I fire.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy slowly reached her hand out and set the dagger on a counter. The officer was satisfied, and turned his attention to Faith. She gave in, and tossed the bow aside. </P>
<p>&quot;Your boss is gonna be very upset when he hears about this.&quot; Faith said.</P>
<P>&quot;Spread 'em.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You wish.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hands in the air where I can see 'em. Slow!&quot; The officer was worried about what Faith might do.</P>
<P>She smiled at him, but did as she was told and raised her arms over her head. Buffy raised hers as well, but up to her shoulders.</P>
<P>&quot;Good. Now cuff 'em.&quot;</P>
<P>His partner holstered his gun and reached into his belt for his cuffs. </P>
<P>&quot;I like him. He's butch.&quot; Faith said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles and Wesley were in his office. Wesley was checking out some of the pictures on the wall, while he was sitting at his desk.</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't say you had emotional problems. I said you had an emotional problem. It's quite different.&quot; Wesley said.</P>
<P>&quot;My 'attachment' to the Slayer is not a problem. In point of fact, it's been a very...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The way you've handled this assignment is something of an embarrassment to the Council.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you want to criticize my methods, fine. And then I can criticize yours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The situation with Buffy was not my doing. It has probably been building towards this for quite some time. I’m surprised you were able to maintain some semblance of control on her for this long.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;First of all, it is entirely your fault. Buffy, to her credit, is a very emotionally driven person. A quality not usually found in Slayers. Most times her personality is an asset, but in this case, it has gotten her lost. </P>
<p>&quot;She cares about people, and that coupled with the strong bond between Slayers, well, it must be very painful for her to watch Faith go down the path she’s on. She obviously feels it is up to her to try and restore Faith, and yet Faith is destroying her. If you had actually thought through your actions, and not tried to take her away, this would not have happened.</P>
<p>&quot;She is your Slayer, and you are her Watcher now. Instead of bickering with me, maybe you should try and help me figure out how to handle this before she is too far gone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This matter will be cleared up in time. My point is, you're no longer qualified to act as Watcher.  It's not your fault. You've done well. It's simply time for somebody else to take the field.&quot; </P>
<P>Giles looked at him, then past him through the window to the main area.</P>
<P>&quot;Now's a good time to start.&quot;</P>
<P>Wesley turned to look as well, and they saw four Eliminati come to take them to Balthazar.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the police car, Buffy and Faith were in the back seat with their hands cuffed behind their backs. A heavy steel mesh separated them from the officers in the front seat.</P>
<P>&quot;That's some artillery you two were puttin' together. You with one of them girl gangs?&quot; One of the officers asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah. We're the Slayers.&quot; The officer laughed. &quot;You wanna get outta here?&quot; She said quietly to Buffy.</P>
<P>She slouched down in the seat. Buffy realized what she intended to do, and was unsure.</P>
<P>&quot;Can't save the world in jail.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy realized she was right and slowly slouched down also. Faith raised her legs, and Buffy followed her lead.</P>
<P>&quot;One, two...&quot;</P>
<P>They both kicked hard into the steel mesh, making it buckle and tear at the edges and hit the officers in the backs of their heads. The driver lost control of the car, and it swerved, screeching to the left and smashed into a parked car. The radiator burst, and steam rose into the air. The officers were unconscious. </P>
<P>Buffy climbed out of the front passenger-side door. A moment later Faith came out too, with one of the officer's keys. They turned back-to-back and fumbled with the keys, trying to unlock the cuffs.</P>
<p>&quot;We should call an ambulance.&quot; Buffy said.</P>
<P>&quot;Five people already have, the racket we made, and they're fine.&quot; She got the cuffs unlocked. &quot;Come on. Let's get outta here. We’re not finished.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy didn't follow.</P>
<P>&quot;Come on!&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy went back to the warehouse, and waited in the alley for Faith. Faith had gone off, and said she’d be back. Buffy looked in. Giles was there, and Wesley. She jumped as she heard a police siren. The car continued down the street.</P>
<p>&quot;Looky what I got.&quot; Faith said walking up carrying the bow from the store.</P>
<p>&quot;I can’t believe you went back there.&quot;</P>
<p>Faith was going to say something, but an Eliminatus jumped down from above them.</P>
<p>&quot;Giles and Wesley are in there!&quot; Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>&quot;Well you aren’t going to be much help to them if you’re dead, so fight!&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Inside the warehouse, Giles and Wesley were watching Balthazar get ‘rejuvenated’.</P>
<p>&quot;The front! The front! Moisten the front!&quot;</P>
<P>He groaned as the water was poured across his chest. Wesley and Giles watched in disgust.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, God! Oh, God!&quot; Wesley panicked.</P>
<P>&quot;It doesn't seem too promising, does it?&quot; Giles asked calmly.</P>
<P>&quot;Stay calm, Mr. Giles. We have to stay calm.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, thank God you're here. I was planning to panic.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is that thing?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That would be your demon. You know, the dead one?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no need to get snippy.&quot;</P>
<P>Balthazar looked at the two Watchers. &quot;Bring them closer.&quot;</P>
<P>They were shoved closer.</P>
<P>&quot;You know what I want.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If it's for me to scrub those hard-to-reach areas, I'd like to request you kill me now.&quot; Giles said. He was hit in the back of the head. &quot;Ow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you out of your mind? This is hardly the time for games!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not? They're going to torture us to death anyway.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're not wrong about that.&quot; Balthazar snickered.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, hold on. We can deal with this rationally. We have something you want. You have something we want.&quot; Wesley was caving.</P>
<P>&quot;Hmm. A trade. Intriguing. No. Wait. Boring. Pull off his kneecaps!&quot;</P>
<P>Two vampires grabbed Wesley.</P>
<P>&quot;No, no, no! It’s in our office at the school. I can get it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quiet, you twerp! They'll kill us both.&quot; Giles said.</P>
<P>&quot;But I'd like to have my kneecaps.&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Out in the alley, the vampire roared and came at Buffy. She sidestepped him, grabbed, and shoved him into the back of a truck. He came at her again and did a front snap kick at her, but she blocked. She returned with a roundhouse kick to his gut, knocking him to the pavement. Buffy jumped on him, and they began to struggle. Another vampire joined in as Faith struggled with her bow.</P>
<P>&quot;Screw it!&quot; Faith said to herself.</P>
<P>She dropped the bow, but held onto the arrow. She ducked a roundhouse kick from the demon, and did a kick to his side, and he staggered into the side of a truck. Faith came at him with her arrow and plunged it home as he turned around to attack again. He burst into ashes. Buffy got up holding her stake, having just dusted hers as well.</P>
<P>&quot;I think we've got more comin'!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We're never gonna make it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If they keep coming one at a time, we got a shot.&quot;</P>
<P>Suddenly another Eliminatus landed in front of them and thrust at Faith with his short sword. She reacted instantly, catching his arm and shoving him into a crate, then pulling him off and swinging him backward onto a pile of several chords of wood. Buffy stepped right in and staked him. He crumbled to ash. They continued down the alley.</P>
<P>At the end of the building an arm reached out and grabbed Buffy by the shoulder. Instantly she grabbed the man and threw him against a dumpster. Faith jumped right in to stake him. He slumped down to the ground, hurt by the impact against the heavy steel container. It was Allan, but Faith was too caught up in things and to realize who he was.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, no!&quot;</P>
<P>Faith swung down with her stake and plunged it into Allan's heart, then pulled it out. Allan grabbed his chest. Blood poured out. Faith backed away as Buffy quickly got down beside him to try to help him. Allan pulled his hands away and looked down at them covered in his own blood, shaking hard as he went into shock. Buffy looked at the wound and saw it was bad.</P>
<p>&quot;Don't move!&quot; Buffy said to him.</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't... I didn't know. I didn't know.&quot; Faith said in shock.</P>
<P>She was overwhelmed. Trying her best to rationalize her fear, and what had just happened, she thought, <I>‘The bastard was probably gonna squeal anyway.’  </I>Not surprisingly, it didn’t help her.</P>
<P>&quot;We need to call 911, now!&quot; Buffy yelled at Faith.</P>
<P>Allan shook harder as the blood loss increased. He looked up at Buffy.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't move, it's okay...&quot; She was trying to apply pressure to the wound. &quot;I need, I need something to stop the...&quot;</P>
<P>Allan began to convulse, and blood started to trickle from the corner of his mouth. He looked down at his chest one last time, then reached up to Buffy, but his arm never made it. It fell to his side, and his body relaxed against the dumpster, finally dead. His eyes remained wide open.  Buffy gaped, terrified.</P>
<p><I>‘I just killed a guy…’ </I>Faith kept thinking. Then she thought about their safety next.</P>
<P>&quot;We gotta go!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I…can’t. Giles is still…&quot;</P>
<P>Faith closed her eyes, and tried to remember to breathe.</P>
<P>&quot;Fine, go. I’ll take care of this.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy stared at her.</P>
<P>&quot;Go!&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy ran back towards the entrance of the warehouse.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In a room in city hall, the Mayor was standing in the middle of a pentagram, chanting.</P>
<p>&#9;&quot;Potestatem matris nostrae in tenebris invoco. Maledictum filium tuum abomni periculo custodias nunc et in saecula!&quot;</P>
<P>The building began to shake. The Mayor remained still with his eyes closed and moved with the quake. Mr. Trick looked around nervously, as did Vincent who was locked in a cage. Soon it was over, and the Mayor opened his eyes and checked his watch.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't understand why Allan would miss this. He's usually so punctual.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did it work?&quot; Trick asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Let's find out. Open the gate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You sure?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! Hold on&quot;.</P>
<P>He went over to Trick, took Vincent's sword from him, set it tip-down on the floor and let it fall through the cage bars into Vincent's hands. The Mayor stepped back. </P>
<P>&quot;Okay. Now we're ready.&quot;</P>
<P>Trick stepped around to the front of the cage, unlocked the padlock and removed the chains. He pulled open the door, and Vincent rushed out, heading straight for the Mayor. He raised his sword high and brought it down hard on the Mayor's head, slicing it in two. </P>
<P>He didn’t bleed. The flesh inside just shimmered as Vincent pulled back his sword. The two halves of the Mayor's head pulled toward each other and sealed together. He stood before Vincent completely untouched. Mr. Trick waited behind Vincent, and staked him through the back. He exploded into ashes.</P>
<P>&quot;Well! This officially commences the Hundred Days. Nothing can harm me until the Ascension. Gosh, I'm feeling chipper! Who's for a root beer?&quot;</P>
<P>Trick smiled as they left the room.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back at the warehouse, Giles was trying to work at preventing Balthazar from doing anything rash. </P>
<P>&quot;Look, tell you what, let Captain Courageous here go, and I'll tell you what you need to know. How's that deal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is one deal! If your friend here is telling the truth, and my soldiers find the amulet, you will die quickly. If not, you will die slowly. How’s that deal?&quot; </P>
<p>&quot;I really think they should hold out for a better one.&quot; Buffy said, rushing in.</P>
<P>She backhanded one vampire and punched another in the face. The first one raised his sword and tried to attack, but she blocked him and grabbed his arm. She brought it down and kneed him in the gut, making him drop his sword. </P>
<P>Giles saw Buffy catch it, and turned his tied hands toward her. She swung the sword in a high arc and brought it down on the ropes binding his wrists, slicing them cleanly. Giles grabbed Wesley and pushed him out of harm's way.</P>
<P>Buffy swung the sword back at the Eliminatus, but he caught her hand and swung the sword down against the edge of Balthazar's pool, forcing her to drop it. He did a backhand swing at Buffy's face, making her trip forward, but she returned with a back kick at him, and then shoulder rolled onto a large crate to avoid being sliced by another one's sword.</P>
<P>&quot;Unacceptable!&quot; Balthazar yelled.</P>
<P>Out of the way of the fight, Giles untied Wesley's hands. Behind him a vampire roared, and he looked back in time to see and ducked his sword. It hit a shelf, and Giles grabbed the blade and back elbowed the vamp in the face, taking the sword from him. He swung it around and jammed the hilt of the sword into his face as well, then spun around in time to take on another one.</P>
<P>The Eliminatus swung his sword at Giles, who parried it with his own. The vampire swung again, and Giles blocked it. The demon spun around and swung down from above, but again Giles had his sword up in time to block. </P>
<P>He swung his arms around and down, forcing the Eliminatus' sword to the floor and making him bend down with it, and then kneed him in the face. The vampire jerked backward and fell to the floor, dropping his sword. Meanwhile, the one whose sword was taken away by Giles grabbed Wesley from behind, pinning his arms behind his back.</P>
<P>&quot;Giles!&quot;</P>
<P>Giles raised his sword and started to swing it.</P>
<P>&quot;Down!&quot;</P>
<P>Wesley bent over fast, and the blade caught the vampire on the neck and sliced through. The beheaded Eliminatus burst into ashes. Wesley stood back up, shocked at what just happened.</P>
<P>Buffy got to her feet on a raised area of the floor. An Eliminatus came at her with a sword, but she grabbed his arm and pulled him past her over a crate and into a barrel. Another one swung at her, and she blocked him, punched him in the gut, ducked another swing and then backhand punched him in the face. He fell to the floor. </P>
<P>Buffy picked him up and sent him spinning into a huge pile of rope. As he tried to come at her again, she did a spinning wheel kick to his face. He quickly regained his balance and tried to punch her, but she redirected his fist and held onto it while she elbowed him in the face. She swung him around and threw him into a bunch of stacked oil barrels.</P>
<P>She spied an electrical cable hanging down from a lamp directly above Balthazar. She grabbed it and yanked hard, and the lamp fell from the roof with sparks flying right into the pool. Balthazar writhed in agony as he was electrocuted. Giles and Wesley stared in amazement. </P>
<P>Soon Balthazar seemed dead and the circuit breakers shut off the power. Buffy rushed over and looked at Balthazar. She jumped, startled, when his eyes whipped open and he took a sudden, wheezing breath.</P>
<P>&quot;Slayer! You think you've won. When he rises... you'll wish I'd killed you all.&quot;</P>
<P>He let out his last breath and finally died. Buffy looked at Giles, wondering what the demon meant.</P>

<p>The next morning, Faith was in the bathroom at her apartment, washing blood off her hands, and off her shirt. She heard a knock at the door.</P>
<p>&quot;Faith, it's me.&quot; Buffy called from outside.</P>
<P>She left the shirt in the sink and answered the door. </P>
<P>&quot;Hey.&quot; Buffy said.</P>
<P>&quot;Hey.&quot;</P>
<P>Faith walked back to the bathroom and continued to scrub the shirt. Buffy came in, and followed.</P>
<P>&quot;So, I…how are ya doin'?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm alright. You know me.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Do I?&quot; Buffy asked. Faith just stared. &quot;Faith, we need to talk about what we're gonna do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's nothing to talk about. I was doing my job.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Being a Slayer is not the same as being a killer.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;You don’t seem to get it. I am a killer. It was what I was hired to do. Slaying is your thing.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Wait…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Will you stop already? I used you to help me do my job. I was hoping you’d come work with me, but that ain’t gonna happen, is it? You were so close too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, please don't shut me out here. We play on different sides; you were using me, that doesn’t matter right now. Look, sooner or later, we're both gonna have to deal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We can help each other.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't need it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah? Who's wrong now? Faith, you can shut off all the emotions that you want. But eventually, they're gonna find a body.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, this is the last time we're gonna have this conversation, and we're not even having it now, you understand me? There is no body. I took it, weighted it, and dumped it. The body doesn't exist. </P>
<P>&quot;You have nothing to worry about. You can keep the flawless rep, get your girl, and move on. The next time we see each other though, we’ll be on opposite ends of a blade, I hope you get that.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Getting rid of the evidence doesn't make the problem go away.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It does for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, you don't get it. You killed a man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, you don't get it. I don't care.&quot;</P>
<p>Buffy stared at her, disbelieving.</P>
