<!-- Is This Love \ Part 1 -->

<p align="center"><i>Is this love... that I'm feeling?<br> Is this the love I've been searching for?<br> Is this the love... or am I dreaming?<br> This must be love... 'cuz it's really got a hold on me...<br> A hold on me...</i></p>

<p>The soft tones from the lead singer in Whitesnake filtered out through the speakers as Sam aimlessly wandered around her room. </p>

<p>'Is it?' She wondered to herself, not for the first time that evening. 'Can it really be love? Maybe it's just a serious crush?' She considered hopefully. 'A very serious crush, I admit, but a crush none the less.' </p>

<p>It would make everything so much easer to cope with. So much simpler to handle if you knew that it was just a crush. Crushes faded after a while, and then she'd be free to go on with her life again. </p>

<p>But it wasn't a crush. Sam knew that with bone deep sincerity, no matter how hard she tried to tell herself differently. Every day the feeling inside her grew stronger and stronger until it nearly consumed her with its intensity. Her days and nights were spent endlessly shuttled between hopeful daydreams of passionate fantasies and the cold harsh reality with the deep despair of unrequited love. There seemed to be no escape for her, especially since she was forced to spend so much time with the object of her affection, both in school and at home. Each meeting only seemed to fuel her desires even more. </p>

<p>She had been fighting this for so long, but going on like this any longer was slowly driving her insane. She had to do something, but what? She couldn't just come flat out and confess, right? After all, you don't just walk up to your soon to be stepsister and tell her that you're madly in love with her, do you?! 'Not unless you want to have your heart torn out and used as a doorstop,' she chuckled humorlessly to herself.</p>

<p>I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day, And I can't wait to see you again, So I can hold you in my arms!</p>

<p align="center"><i>Is this love...</i></p>

<p>'How on earth did I end up in this mess?... Of all the people in the world, how could I possibly have fallen in love with Brooke McQueen?! Last year she was the bane of my existence... and now I can't live without her... When did it happen?!' Sam let out a frustrated growl and barely resisted the urge to tear at her hair. </p>

<p>The truth was that she couldn't pinpoint the exact moment when her feelings for the blonde cheerleader had changed. It had snuck up on her gradually and all of a sudden she'd just started noticing these little things about the other girl. How her blonde locks flowed beautifully around her shoulders when she walked. How incredibly deep her hazel eyes really were. How pink and impossibly soft her lips seemed. </p>

<p>And instead of the initial reaction of feeling anger and resentment as soon as Brooke showed her face anywhere near her, Sam had started experiencing different feelings. </p>

<p>Very different feelings. </p>

<p>Whenever Brooke would even glance her way, Sam's hands would start to sweat and her heart would begin pounding a mile a minute in her chest. This was very annoying and embarrassing to say the least. Most humiliating of all, however, was that she suddenly found it difficult to articulate simple sentences. She was a friggin' journalist for chrissake! Around Brooke McQueen, though, her brain seemed to become a sudden void. And considering they not only went to school together, but also shared the same house, there was a lot of void for poor Sam. </p>

<p>'I can't take this anymore! I need to get over this- this thing, and I need to do it fast! Before I do something stupid that I'll regret forever...'</p>

<p>Heaving a big sigh, the brunette slowly walked over to her entertainment set and turned the music off. Then she ran a hand over her face and rubbed her tired eyes.</p>

<p>'I just need some distance from this.' She told herself resolutely, completely ignoring the fact that distance hadn't really worked so far. 'If I give it some more time, these feelings will go away. They have to...'</p>

<p>Still deep in thought she walked out the door and down the stairs to the kitchen. Morosely trudging up to the fridge, Sam had just grabbed a bottle of water when the outer door to the kitchen burst open.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Brooke froze halfway through the door and her laughter died on her lips as she spotted Sam standing in the kitchen, an unopened bottle of water in her hand. The blonde's sudden stop caused Nicole, coming up right behind her, to slam straight into her and consequently shove her ungracefully a couple of steps into the room.</p>

<p>"Hey B?! What's your prob...?" Nicole started with a slightly annoyed tone, but her voice trailed off as she suddenly spotted the brunette. "Well, well... if it isn't Spam McFersome," she taunted gleefully coming up beside Brooke and crossing her arms defiantly. "Finally crawled out of that hole in the ground you live in, Spammie?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know you could move around in daylight, Satan," Sam returned tiredly. Pondering her feelings all day had taken its toll and she really wasn't up to this right now. </p>

<p>"Why thank you McFashionless! I didn't know you cared," Nicole smiled with saccharine sweetness that looked as fake as it was. "In fact, I move around quite freely in the daylight, hun. It's actually poor fashion statements like yours that has me running screaming for the hills."</p>

<p>"Then by all means, don't let me hold you back. The hills are that way," Sam commented pointing at the kitchen door. "Don't forget your broomstick on your way out, witch."</p>

<p>The journalist turned to leave but was stopped short by Nicole's smug voice. "Tell me Spam; was it your witty repartee that sent your father to an early grave? Because let me tell you," she fanned herself dramatically, "you're killing me here!"</p>

<p>Brooke gasped at the cruel words coming out of her friend's mouth, but before she had a chance to pull for breath Sam had spun around and stalked up to stand nose to nose with Nicole.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare speak badly of my father's death, Julian," she hissed, her eyes flashing in anger. "You don't know the first thing of what happened, so don't pretend you do." </p>

<p>Spinning around on her heel, Sam glared accusingly at Brooke before stalking out of the kitchen. She would never give either of them the satisfaction of seeing her tears.</p>

<p>The kitchen was eerily quiet for several minutes in the wake of Sam's abrupt departure before Brooke managed to snap out of her shocked daze. Turning angry eyes on Nicole, she had to literally restrain herself from causing the shorter blonde bodily harm. How dared she hurt Sammy like that?!</p>

<p>"That was so totally uncalled for, Nicole!" she stated hotly, fairly bristling with fury.</p>

<p>"Uh, ok, hello?!" Nicole spluttered. She couldn't believe Brookie was actually defending the social misfit. "That was Spam! Since when do we care about her anyway?"</p>

<p>"Since she's almost my stepsister, dammit!" Brooke ground out. It took all she had not to bop Nic over the head. "Look, I'm tired of this whole 'Let's burn Sam at the stakes' thing you've got going. It's gotten pretty old lately. Besides, I have to live with her, you know, and you are not making it any easier," she hissed angrily.</p>

<p>"Well, excuse me," Nicole declared petulantly "but just because you have to live with her doesn't mean I have to like her!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not," Brooke admitted, still furious, "but you don't have to deliberately try to go out of your way to make her upset!" Shaking her head slightly Brooke ran a hand through her blonde locks with an irritated motion. "Just... go home, Nic," she fumed. "You've done enough for one day. And don't bother coming back until you've learned to behave yourself!" </p>

<p>Standing stock still, her mouth hanging open, Nicole could merely stare at Brooke in stunned surprise for several seconds. Then, just as quickly as she had lost them, Nicole regained her senses and her blue eyes flashed with anger and indignation.</p>

<p>"Whatever!" she got out in an irritated huff. Spinning around on her Prada-clad heel she left, loudly slamming the door behind her.</p>

<p>Brooke pulled in a deep breath and felt her anger dissipate somewhat with the other blonde's departure. She remained in the kitchen for a while before managing to gather up enough courage to go and try to smooth things over with her irate housemate.</p>
