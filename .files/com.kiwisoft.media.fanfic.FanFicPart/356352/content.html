<!-- About a Girl \ Part 25 -->

<p>Grace winced as Katie snapped at Miriam Crow, effectively cutting the
girl a new asshole for making the serious mistake of trying to talk
to her.  Poor Miriam, Grace thought to herself.  She was renowned
around school for her cluelessness and it had now come to bite her in
the ass.  While Katie had always been known around the school for her
relative friendliness . thus separating herself in a good way from
the majority of the popular crowd . everyone had realized days ago
that: one, it was best to stay out of Katie's way now and two, dark
bags were not a good look on the dirty blonde.  Everyone that was
except for poor, oblivious Miriam.</p>

<p>"So what are some of the causes of world hunger?" Mrs. Simpson asked
the class, her attention focusing on Katie who was slouched over in
her chair looking barely conscious.  "Ms. Singer?" she asked causing
Katie to look up at her grouchily.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie replied softly without even attempting to look
like she had considered the question before hanging her head back
down and beginning to zone out again when Mrs. Simpson interrupted
her again.</p>

<p>"Surely you must have at least a suggestion," Mrs. Simpson replied.
She didn't understand what was going on with Katie recently, even
though the girl had never really been big on handing in her homework,
she was one of the best students in the class. However, lately she
had been off of her game, so far off of her game that her game was
like a dot to her.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie said wearily closing her eyes and wishing the
woman would leave her alone.  "How about your fat ass?" she continued
barely aware of the gasps from the students sitting around her.  </p>

<p>Grace shook her head as she watched Katie slouch out of the
classroom, her first class ticket to the principles office firmly
grasped in her hand.   Grace sighed and turned away from the door as
Katie's figure disappeared, her eyes returning to her notebook as she
wondered what could possibly have gone so wrong between her and
Jessie.  The two of them had been like the perfect couple, almost
sickeningly in love.  To have gone from `I see forever in your eyes'
to whatever kick it was the two of them were on now just didn't make
any sense to Grace, and she figured that that was the problem because
it probably wasn't making any sense to them either.</p>

<p><u><i>Katie's House . Three days later</i></u></p>

<p>"You're mom let me in," Sarah said into the darkness of Katie's
bedroom.  She could hear Billie Holiday playing softly in the
background and could just make out Katie's figure sprawled listlessly
across the bed.</p>

<p>"Great, then she can let you out too," Katie muttered into the
darkness, not moving an inch.  Movement might have indicated some
sort of interest on her part in whatever it was that had brought
Sarah over, and she absolutely didn't want that to happen.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that," Sarah said softly, reaching over to turn on a
nearby lamp.  "The last thing you really want is to be alone," she
continued now able to see Katie, instead of merely a mass on the
bed.  </p>

<p>"Thanks for the analysis Dr. Freud," Katie mumbled sarcastically in
response as she shied away from the light Sarah just turned on.   She
was like a miner who'd been underground for too long suddenly exiting
the shaft, and Sarah wondered how long she'd been lying there in the
dark.  </p>

<p>"Now get outta here," Katie continued oblivious to the look on
concern covering the other girls face.  "Go on, Am Scray," she
continued impatiently, just wanting to be left alone.  She missed
Jessie so much that it was like even breathing took up to much effort
now that her girlfriend wasn't around anymore.  The first couple of
days after the weekend, when she'd started giving Jessie the silent
treatment, had been fine.  She'd had righteous indignation to hold
onto and had truly believed that things would blow over, but now it'd
been a week, and it was like she was dying.  She didn't want to eat,
or talk or do anything.  She was just sad.</p>

<p>Sarah walked over to the bed, the idea of actually leaving Katie
alone not even occurring to her, and sat down on the edge of it
watching Katie sadly.  She looked like shit, just like she had for
day upon days.  This wasn't like Katie she'd never seen the other
girl so upset, it seemed wrong somehow, like it was against nature.
Katie was a person naturally acclimated to the light; the darkness
didn't suit her at all in Sarah's eyes.  She wanted Katie to smile
again, and she wanted to be the one to cause it.  She would bring
back the light.</p>

<p>"You can act as tough as you want, but I'm not leaving," Sarah said
softly.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," Katie muttered covering her head with a pillow so
that she wouldn't have to listen to Sarah's pseudo-psychology new age-
y bullshit anymore.  All she wanted to do was sleep, and brood, and
wallow in self-pity while cursing herself, and she could do all of
that just was well with Sarah there as she could alone. </p>

<hr>

<p>Katie licked the skin beneath her lips, moaning as she felt a hand
begin to slip under her shirt, tracing her skin lightly.  "Jessie,"
she mumbled against the salty skin of the neck her lips were attached
to, pressing soft kisses along it as she felt the hand under her
shirt begin to slip further up.  Jessie, Jessie, Jessie her mind sung
deliriously.</p>

<p>"Jessie," she said again, gasping this time as the hand cupped her
breast massaging it lightly.  "I love you so much," she whispered
reverently pressing herself into the hand that had stopped moving.</p>

<p>The hand began to move again a second later, but the slight
hesitation was enough for the haze surrounding Katie to begin to lift
and for the first time since the touching started she began to become
aware of her surrounding, and the more she did, the more she knew
that something was seriously amiss.  Jessie?</p>

<p>The scent of the body above her was wrong, the hands pressed against
her body weren't nearly delicate enough, the body itself felt larger,
and the hair was too long . and dark.  Then it all started to come
back to her, Sarah showing up uninvited and sitting on the bed, her
ignoring her and trying to go to sleep completely exhausted from all
of the weeks emotional stress, and a dream of Jessie where they
hadn't been fighting and everything was perfect and Jessie was
kissing her.</p>

<p>Katie bucked up violently, dislodging the body on top of her and
rolled off of her bed, standing up and turning around to stare down
at Sarah like she'd never seen her before.  She wanted to start
brushing off her body, or jump into a lake.  Dirty, she felt dirty.</p>

<p>"What the fuck do you think you're doing!?!" Katie whispered harshly,
anger settling in over her now that the shock of the situation had
worn off. </p>

<p>"I didn't do anything," Sarah responded as Katie stalked toward her
and yanked her off the bed.  Ripping her hand out of Katie's grasp
she continued to speak, her voice high and defensive.  "You started
it.  I was just sitting there waiting for you to wake up when you
wrapped yourself around me and started to kiss me," she went on
looking at Katie as she blinked back tears.</p>

<p>"Don't give me that," Kate responded acerbically glaring over that
the other girl.  "You knew I was thinking about her, not you," she
continued accusingly remembering very well what she had said when
Sarah's hand had paused, and that it had paused before she'd tried to
keep on going.  She distinctly remembered saying Jessie's name, so
Sarah had to have heard and decided that it didn't matter that she
was half unconscious and thinking about someone else.</p>

<p>"Come on, Kate," Sarah said realizing that she was in a very
precarious position.  She hadn't intended to start anything with
Katie, at least not like that, and she had tried to resist when Katie
had started to kiss her, she'd really meant to stop it.  But, Katie
had been so tender and passionate, so loving that she couldn't help
but give in.  Nothing she and Katie had shared in the summer and for
those few months in the fall had been anything like what had just
happened, the past had been like a shadow, a whisper in the wind.
She'd been swept up in the magic of it all, the beauty of it, the
purity of emotion, ecstatic at the thought she was sharing this with
Katie.  And then she'd heard Jessie's name fall adoringly from
Katie's lips.  That's when she had realized that Katie didn't even
know who she was with, but by then it had stopped mattering to her
because everything that she had dreamed since that first day Katie
had smiled at her was finally coming true, and even though it wasn't
exactly what she had hoped for it was enough.  It was good enough and
she couldn't stop herself from taking it.  "It wasn't so bad," she
continued imploringly.  "Didn't it feel good?"</p>

<p>Katie paced back away from her towards the back of the room, running
an agitated hand through her hair, before finally turning around to
face Sarah again, to face her for the last time.  "Go.  Now," she
ground out softly, but viscerally, trying valiantly to stop herself
from walking across the room and throttling Sarah were she
stood.  "And don't come back, and don't talk to me. Ever.  Again,"
she finished dropping her head down and turning her back to Sarah.</p>
