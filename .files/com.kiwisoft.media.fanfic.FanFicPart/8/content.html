<p>Lieutenant Torres' fingers worked away at the holodeck
control panel but her mind was wandering again and her face
had an angry, pinched look. Lines of tiredness marred her
eyes and her normal caramel complexion was unusually pale.
They had been arguing again; it was all they seemed to do
these days; an endless round of carping and irritable
exchanges building up to full-scale war followed by the
inevitable reconciliation, promises to try harder and
exchanges of loving but somehow empty words. It all seemed
so pointless. <i>Damn Tom Paris!</i> She punched angrily at the
display and the panel bleeped in protest.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Incorrect entry sequence.&quot;</i></p>

<p>B'Elanna took a deep breath and tried to focus on the task
at hand. Her relationship problems would just have to wait,
she had too much work to do. <i>What the hell was wrong with
the holodeck?</i> &quot;Computer, how long till the diagnostic is
complete?&quot;</p>

<p><i>&quot;One minute and thirty six seconds.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Did she even love him anymore? She snorted. Amend that; had
she ever <i>really</i> loved him? She paused in her work to give
this serious thought. At the beginning she thought she had
but maybe she'd been wrong all along; maybe the thought of
seventy years aboard this ship had sent her mistakenly into
the arms of the first person who'd offered something more
than friendship. But what if the relationship <i>was</i> worth
salvaging? There had been some good times after all, and it
wasn't as if there was a queue of prospective partners
willing to put up with her klingon temperament. She had to
give him that at least: whatever his deficiencies, he
wasn't put off by her volatility. She grinned wryly. What a
wonderful basis for a marriage.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Diagnostic complete; corrupt data fragment in buffer
memory block gamma-seven.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>At last!</i> &quot;Computer, purge buffer memory block
gamma-seven.&quot;</p>

<p><i>&quot;Unable to comply.&quot;</i></p>

<p>She'd just have to delete it manually then. After a few
deft movements of her hands over the display the panel once
again bleeped its displeasure.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Unable to access; file corrupted.&quot;</i></p>

<p>This was going to take longer than she'd  thought. She had
barely started to work on it when, behind her, she heard
the quiet whoosh of the corrupt fragment being accidentally
called into photonic existence. She turned, curious to see
what it was, and her jaw dropped. She was staring at a
holographic simulation of herself. The hologram flickered
and hissed fitfully but, despite the corruption of the
data, she could clearly see her surprise mirrored on the
hologram's face.</p>

<p>&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; came the distorted voice, <i>her</i>
voice, distant and broken up as if heard over a weak
commlink. &quot;Where's...&quot; And then the hologram flickered out
of existence.</p>

<p>She remained motionless, staring at the spot the hologram
had occupied, her mind temporarily numbed by what she'd
seen. Why had it been sprawled on a luxurious, silk-dressed
bed? <i>And why had it been naked?</i> As the initial shock
began to wear off the realisation hit her and her jaw
clenched. The damn thing was someone's sex-toy! She could
hardly believe it; someone was using a holographic
simulation of her for their own sleazy sexual fantasies.
How long had that <i>thing</i> been in the database? And more
importantly: <i>who had programmed it?</i></p>

<p>A growl rumbled in the back of her throat when the answer
came to her. Of course: Paris. A few weeks ago he'd dangled
a couple of restraints in front of her face one evening,
affecting a coy smile and suggesting that they &quot;try
something different for a change&quot;. She'd just rolled her
eyes wearily, exhausted from a day spent crawling through
the cramped Jeffries tube system and, if truth be told, she
hadn't felt like doing <i>anything</i> with him for the past
couple of months, different or otherwise. He hadn't
mentioned it again and she had completely forgotten about
it. Voyager seemed determined to tire her to the point of
collapse lately and she hadn't had time to think of
anything but the ship's maintenance. Obviously though, Tom
hadn't forgotten about it at all.</p>

<p>It was over between them, there was no avoiding it; it had
been for some time but she hadn't been able to admit it to
herself... until now. She supposed she ought to thank him for
his latest little holographic venture; it had shown her
just how bad things had become between them. But she was
still going to flay him alive.</p>

<p>At the sound of the holodeck doors opening she turned and
almost growled again as Seven strode in. She could do
without seeing <i>her</i> right now. It was true that they'd
been getting along more amicably recently but, with the way
she felt at the moment, she didn't think she could keep her
temper in check.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant, you were supposed to meet me in Engineering
twenty minutes ago.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a hint of irritation in the statuesque blonde's
voice and B'Elanna had to clamp down hard. Tom Paris wasn't
worth a return to their former hostilities. &quot;I'm busy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I know.&quot; She continued dryly, &quot;Ensign Vorik informed
me that you were repairing the holodeck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Exactly; you'll have to wait.&quot;</p>

<p>The slight pursing of Seven's lips showed that she hadn't
been entirely successful in keeping the anger from her
voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant, I find it curious that you place a higher
priority on the functioning of a holodeck than my proposed
improvements to the impulse drive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take a look at them later,&quot; she snapped. &quot;Right now
I'm busy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you said,&quot; retorted Seven, &quot;but I believe you are
trying to avoid considering my suggestions.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna closed her eyes and took a deep breath in an
effort to stay calm. She really didn't want this to turn
into yet another confrontation so she did her best to adopt
a reasonable tone. &quot;I said I'd take a look and I will, just
as soon as I've got the time. What would make you think
that anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>Seven looked away for a moment and B'Elanna was suddenly
struck by how vulnerable she was beneath that cool
exterior; it was something that Seven rarely let anyone
see. Sometimes she had a tendency to forget that there was
a living, breathing woman behind that mask of efficient
superiority, but it was a mistake that she made less
frequently now that their relationship was thawing. When
the ex-borg looked back her composure had returned and her
voice didn't betray the pain she'd seen flash in those
ice-blue eyes for that short instant.</p>

<p>&quot;You have always reacted negatively to my proposals; you
always delay their consideration or simply reject them
immediately without investigating their worth. I believe
you allow your personal dislike of me to cloud your
objectivity.&quot;</p>

<p>She noticed the rise and fall of Seven's chest and realised
that the woman hadn't quite regained her composure after
all.</p>

<p>Seven continued, a distinctly emotional tremor in her
voice. &quot;Perhaps you even feel hatred towards me but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, I don't <i>hate</i> you!&quot; B'Elanna interjected, stepping
forward unconsciously, in the grip of some emotion she
couldn't quite identify, knowing only that seeing Seven so
obviously upset didn't feel pleasant. They remained
face-to-face for a few seconds that seemed more like
minutes. B'Elanna could see the faintest flush of the
younger woman's pale cheeks and wanted to reach out to her
somehow but didn't know what to say. Finally Seven broke
eye contact, dropping her gaze to the floor between them.
She took in an audible breath before expelling it in a sigh
as she raised her dimpled chin once more, her face
impassive. This time it seemed that she would not lose her
composure.</p>

<p>&quot;Regardless of your motives, you are not receptive when I
make suggestions for Voyager's improvement; today is simply
another example of that.&quot;</p>

<p>When B'Elanna replied her voice was softer. &quot;I <i>will</i> take
a look at your proposals, I promise; right now just isn't a
good time.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven nodded reluctantly. &quot;Very well.&quot; She made to leave,
but stopped suddenly and turned back to face her, her
expression tinged with concern. &quot;Lieutenant, are you all
right? Can I... help?&quot; She hesitated over the words, not
used to saying such things to B'Elanna.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm okay, just tired; but thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I could assist you with the holodeck repairs.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna became alarmed. There was no way she was going to
risk the ex-borg seeing that libidinous program. &quot;No, it's
all right, Seven; it won't take long. Look, I'll let you
know as soon as I've finished here, then we can go over
your suggestions. Okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Seven opened her mouth as if to say something but paused,
her face troubled. &quot;Lieutenant, you do not look well.
Perhaps you should go to Sickbay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, I'm just tired; it's nothing to worry about.&quot;</p>

<p>The statuesque blonde shifted uncomfortably. &quot;You do not
look <i>tired</i>, you look exhausted; as you have for several
weeks.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna noticed that Seven's hands had left their
customary position behind her back and were fidgeting
restlessly at her sides, and she was surprised to realise
that the normally imperturbable woman was embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;I am... concerned about you. If there's any way I can
assist you...&quot; She tailed-off, looking more awkward by the
second.</p>

<p>B'Elanna stared at her speechlessly for several moments
feeling a curious sense of wonder. Seven appeared to be
genuinely worried about her. It seemed that their
relationship had changed more than she'd realised and she
found herself warmed by the borg's concern.</p>

<p>&quot;It's something I have to deal with myself,&quot; she managed at
last, &quot;but thank you.&quot; She had a sudden vision of borg
assimilation tubules plunging into Tom's neck and almost
grinned. &quot;I'll remember your offer though.&quot;</p>

<p>After a moment Seven nodded again and without another word
she turned and strode from the holodeck. B'Elanna got the
peculiar impression that she was both reluctant to leave
and at the same time in a hurry to escape the cause of her
sudden embarrassment, which was apparently herself, though
she had no idea what she had done to occasion Seven's
strange behaviour. She watched as the doors closed behind
the shapely woman, and wondered what the hell all that had
been about. She was also surprised to realise that she was
beginning to think of Seven as a potential friend.</p>

<p>Shaking her head in bemusement at this strange turn of
events, she moved back to the holodeck controls and began
the task of deleting the program fragment. After a few
seconds though, she stopped as it occurred to her to wonder
whether she could trust Tom to delete his program. She
decided to use the corrupt fragment to track it down in the
database, just in case... After all, he probably wouldn't
be feeling too co-operative once she'd finished with him.</p>

<p align=center>* * *</p>

<p><br>B'Elanna paced about their quarters restlessly and tried to
keep a rein on her temper. An emergency with the plasma
manifolds had stopped her from seeing him at midday and
when she'd finally got in from her shift Tom had been and
gone, leaving behind the remnants of a quick meal. The
computer had confirmed what she'd already assumed;
naturally he was on the holodeck. He'd sounded out of
breath when he'd finally answered her hail, naturally. That
had been fifteen minutes ago. Just how long did it take to
get from Holodeck One to their quarters? The petaQ was
probably finishing off with that <i>thing</i>. She gritted her
teeth and briefly considered employing one of the
meditation exercises Tuvok had taught her; she didn't want
to end up in the Brig for assault; on the other hand maybe
it would be worth it.</p>

<p>At the sound of the doors opening she spun around and
watched silently as he entered. Seeing that he really was
out of breath she closed her eyes and forced herself to
think of a calm, blue sea, a serene expanse of water
untroubled by storms, wide and bright and blue... blue like
Seven's eyes. She was so surprised by this association that
the mental exercise almost had the desired effect, but when
he spoke and she opened her eyes to look at him the anger
returned in full force.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what's so urgent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Luckily nothing!&quot; she snapped. &quot;Or it'd be too late by
now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you know... I had to take a sonic shower.&quot; He
grinned boyishly. &quot;We worked up quite a sweat.&quot;</p>

<p>She gaped at him. She couldn't believe his impudence.</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna, are you okay?&quot; He moved towards her, a worried
frown on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Stay away from me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Worked up a sweat did you?&quot; she growled, her voice thick
with anger. &quot;On the holodeck with that... that <i>thing</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>Now he was looking confused as well as worried. &quot;Since when
did Harry become a <i>thing</i>? Maybe I should call the Doc...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Harry?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, Harry... hoverball... our weekly game?&quot;</p>

<p>She began to feel a little stupid. &quot;Oh. Right, your weekly
game.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked askance at her. &quot;You know, maybe you should ask
the Captain for some time off; I think you've been working
too hard lately.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Some</i> of us don't have the time to mess about on the
holodeck all day long.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you jealous of Harry?&quot; he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know I've been spending a bit of time with him
recently,&quot; as he continued his voice filled with sarcasm,
&quot;but frankly things haven't been too friendly round here
lately, have they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This has nothing to do with him!&quot; she bellowed, furious at
the way he was trying to turn this back on her. &quot;I found
your damn holoprogram!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Program? B'Elanna, you're not making any sense! I
forfeited a week's replicator rations for this so do you
want to actually tell me what's on your mind?&quot;</p>

<p>At his indignation she had to restrain herself from leaping
at him. &quot;That sex-toy! You know: the bed, the naked woman...
looks just like me.&quot;</p>

<p>He gaped at her in bewilderment. &quot;I don't know what you're
talking about.&quot;</p>

<p>It was true. Much as she didn't want to believe it, she
could see that he honestly knew nothing about the program.
Her anger began to drain away, to be replaced by shame and
embarrassment. How could she have jumped to such a
conclusion? Tom had his faults but why had she been so
ready to believe it was him? It could have been any one of
the hundred-and-fifty people onboard.</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna, what the hell is going on? Talk to me.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned away and slumped into a chair, feeling foolish
and dejected. With a sigh, she finally worked up the
courage to tell him about what she'd discovered on the
holodeck.</p>

<p>When she'd finished he looked at her sadly. &quot;Didn't you
even <i>try</i> to find out who'd written it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was classified,&quot; she said defensively. &quot;I used every
decryption protocol I could think of but whoever wrote it
is good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you just assumed it was me,&quot; he stated flatly.</p>

<p>They said nothing for a few moments and there seemed to be
a finality in the silence that they were both aware of.</p>

<p>Finally Tom shook his head and sighed. &quot;So, what are you
going to do? Maybe you should take this to Tuvok or
Chakotay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No way; I don't want anyone else seeing it. I'll handle it
myself for now.&quot; She paused, reluctant to go on, but knew
there was no point in putting this off. &quot;Tom...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I know. We need to talk.&quot; With a tired sigh he
dropped into the chair opposite her.</p>

<p align=center>* * *</p>

<p><br>Seven sat alone in the Mess Hall and mechanically ate her
salad, barely aware of the meal as she once again found
herself thinking about the fiery Chief of Engineering. When
had this obsession begun? She searched her memory, trying
to pinpoint the exact moment that the brilliant and
passionate woman had started to take a hold on her. She
couldn't be sure, and she suspected that her interest in
B'Elanna had begun some time before she became consciously
aware of it, but she clearly remembered the defining moment
some two months ago. Her sexuality had just been starting
to blossom and she'd started to be aware of her body in a
way she'd never been before; unfamiliar feelings and
desires were making themselves known to her, understood
intellectually but, until now, not really understood at
all. They'd been working in Jeffries Tube
thirty-seven-alpha and in that cramped space, their bodies
unavoidably brushing against each other as they worked,
she'd become increasingly focused on the Lieutenant's
physical presence and had been forced, at last, to admit to
herself that she was attracted to the woman who had made
her dislike of her known in no uncertain terms. If it had
only been sexual attraction she wouldn't have found the
past months such a trial, but it was more than that; there
was an emotional component to her obsession that she found
alarming to contemplate.</p>

<p>At the sound of the doors opening she glanced up from her
meal but it was only Ensign Mulchaey. She sighed. It seemed
that Lieutenant Torres was going to avoid her once again.
Yesterday it had been some emergency with the plasma
manifolds. She'd thought that the Lieutenant had been
sincere on the holodeck but when two hours had passed and
she still hadn't contacted her, she'd made her way to
Engineering again to find an agitated half-klingon
bellowing orders and bustling about. Admittedly the problem
was a relatively serious one but she couldn't help feeling
that the Lieutenant had deliberately arranged it, or at the
very least could have delegated the supervision of the
repairs. It was irrational of her she knew, but where the
Lieutenant was concerned she was finding it increasingly
difficult to think rationally. She wondered if she should
consult the Doctor but she was afraid she already knew what
his diagnosis would be.</p>

<p>Ironically, perhaps the hardest thing about it all was the
hope: the hope that something might happen between them.
Though they still shared the occasional tense moment, they
had been on much friendlier terms recently and Seven
couldn't stop herself from hoping that they might get
closer still, that Lieutenant Torres - B'Elanna - might
come to feel the same way about her. But of course, there
was the marriage. She <i>knew</i> that nothing would ever come
of her desires. Hope, though, wouldn't quite die; over the
last few weeks she'd overheard several of her crewmates
discussing the possibility that the marriage might not
last.</p>

<p>She poked at her salad irritably, suddenly annoyed at her
bout of self-pity. At that moment Lieutenant Torres entered
the Mess Hall and she felt her heartbeat quicken.</p>

<p align=center>* * *</p>

<p><br>As B'Elanna entered the Mess Hall she immediately spotted
Seven sitting at a table near the counter. Neither Tuvok
nor Naomi Wildman were here so she was, of course, eating
alone. How many times over the years had she come into the
Mess Hall and seen Seven sitting alone? How many times had
she ignored the woman and taken her meal to another table?
Too many she realised reprovingly as she approached.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Seven, you've got me at last.&quot; The ex-drone shifted
uncomfortably at this for some reason. &quot;I'll just get
something to eat and then we can take a look at your
ideas.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I recommend that you avoid <i>Today's Special</i>. Several
crewmen have had to make rapid exits shortly after
beginning their meals.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna snorted in amusement and watched as a shy smile
stole across Seven's face. &quot;I'll have the salad as well
then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A wise decision. You may find it a bland choice but it is
less likely to cause you extreme physical discomfort.&quot;</p>

<p>This time she laughed and for several seconds they simply
looked at one another warmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'll be back in a minute,&quot; said B'Elanna at last and
moved to the counter to wait for Neelix to finish serving
Crewman Chell, who was apparently having the <i>Special</i>.</p>

<p>It was strange the way she'd begun to see Seven in a
different light. Was it Seven who had changed or herself?
Perhaps both of them had. Either way, at some point she had
started to find the haughty yet somehow vulnerable woman's
company rather enjoyable. It appeared that they might
actually become friends... perhaps there was even the
possibility of more. She pushed the thought away hurriedly.
Now was hardly the appropriate time to be thinking about
such things... and with Seven! Besides, she had more
immediate concerns: just <i>who</i> had written that program?</p>

<p>&quot;What can I get you, Lieutenant?&quot;</p>

<p>Startled, she looked up to see Neelix beaming at her.
&quot;Um...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How about <i>Today's Special</i>? A delicious blend of...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll just have the salad,&quot; she interrupted hurriedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; He looked disappointed. &quot;One Splak Salad coming up.&quot;
He began to busy himself with her meal. &quot;So B'Elanna, how
have you been lately?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; she replied warily, sensing that his cheeriness had
switched into Morale Officer mode.</p>

<p>&quot;You've looked a bit under the weather lately, if you don't
mind me saying so. Anything I can help you with? Perhaps
home-life's not going...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're getting divorced,&quot; she said shortly, realising that
it was pointless trying to delay the gossip.</p>

<p>He looked sad but not surprised. &quot;I'm so sorry, B'Elanna.
If there's anything I can do...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay Neelix, but thanks; it's for the best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you've made the right decision; sometimes things
just don't work out the way you hope.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're just not suited I guess; to be honest, it's a relief
to have it over and done with.&quot; And it was. Since they'd
agreed to the divorce yesterday she'd felt as if an
oppressive weight had been lifted from her shoulders.</p>

<p>He nodded sympathetically. &quot;If you need to talk...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine, really Neelix,&quot; she stated firmly.</p>

<p>&quot;How's Tom taking it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He knew it was over between us; there's no point in
fighting the inevitable. I haven't seen him since last
night though; he stayed with Harry.&quot;</p>

<p>Neelix handed over her plate of Splak Salad, a thoughtful
expression on his face. &quot;Well, since you obviously don't
need me in my capacity as Morale Officer perhaps I should
go and see him later, just to make sure he's all right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good idea,&quot; she said, relieved that his attention, well
meaning though it was, had been deflected. She was about to
leave with her meal when a thought struck her. &quot;Hey Neelix,
you hear a lot about the ship's business don't you? You
usually know what's going on with people...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you're not suggesting I'm a gossip!&quot; he said
indignantly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, of course not.&quot;</p>

<p>He made a show of looking around in a surreptitious manner
then leaned over the counter and grinned conspiratorially
at her. &quot;I do hear the occasional interesting rumour of
course. According to the grapevine the Delaney sisters have
been...&quot;</p>

<p>Intrigued though she was she interrupted him, speaking in
an undertone. &quot;Listen Neelix, have you heard anyone talking
about me lately? I don't know... maybe someone who's got a
crush on me or something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't think so. Have you got a secret admirer
already?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's one way of putting it,&quot; she muttered wryly then
continued in a near whisper. &quot;Well, what about the
holodeck? Anyone been talking about any new programs? Of
the um... adult variety.&quot;</p>

<p>His bushy eyebrows shot up. &quot;No, sorry B'Elanna; I haven't
heard anything like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you looking at me like that?&quot; she asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>&quot;This adult holoprogram...&quot;</p>

<p>That had been foolish of her; Neelix wasn't stupid and was
perfectly capable of putting two and two together. &quot;Don't
ask. And if you breathe a word about this to anyone I'll
kill you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood,&quot; he murmured sincerely.</p>

<p>She gave him a parting warning glance and went to sit next
to Seven and her stack of PADDs.</p>

<p align=center>* * *</p>

<p><br>When she heard the words &quot;we're getting divorced&quot; she felt
a sort of numbness overtake her and missed much of the rest
of the conversation. By the time the shock began to wear
off they were almost whispering and all she caught was
&quot;I'll kill you&quot;. As the Lieutenant approached, she mentally
steeled herself against the hope that was threatening to
engulf her and took a deep breath in an effort to calm her
racing heart. Suddenly she felt guilty for taking pleasure
in this development that was surely causing B'Elanna
distress. Looking closely at her though, she couldn't see
any signs of the unhappiness she should be feeling; if
anything the engineer looked better than she had in some
time.</p>

<p>Sitting down next to her B'Elanna took a bite of her salad
and pulled a face. &quot;You're right, it <i>is</i> bland.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven struggled for a suitable reply, wanting to continue
the camaraderie that had begun to develop between them, but
her mind seemed strangely blank.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>How could she answer this? She didn't know herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am functioning... adequately.&quot; B'Elanna looked doubtful
and to forestall any further enquiries she continued.
&quot;Lieutenant, I apologise for overhearing your conversation
with Mr Neelix but I want you to know that I'm sorry that
your marriage to Lieutenant Paris is to be dissolved.&quot; This
was possibly the first time she'd ever knowingly lied. She
was half-expecting to be told to mind her own business and
added tentatively, &quot;If I can assist you in any way...&quot; She
stopped in surprise as B'Elanna reached across and gently
squeezed her borg-enhanced hand. At the feel of the
physical contact she found herself rendered speechless
again. For a second her whole world was reduced to the feel
of that strong hand clasping hers, the warmth and texture
that enveloped her, connecting her with the woman she
desired so much. Then she pulled her hand away quickly as
if burned, afraid that her emotional turmoil would be
revealed and that B'Elanna would somehow divine what this
contact meant to her. There was an awkward silence and
Seven strove to regain control of herself, suddenly annoyed
that she was allowing this woman to reduce her to such a
state of inefficiency.</p>

<p>B'Elanna cleared her throat. &quot;I'm not.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven quirked her eyebrow. &quot;Lieutenant?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not sorry about the divorce; it was a mistake to get
married in the first place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You do not regret the failure of your relationship with
Lieutenant Paris?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I do.&quot; She looked down at her salad and toyed
with it idly. It seemed to Seven that she was perhaps
realising for the first time the full implications of the
situation. &quot;Three wasted years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Better three wasted years than thirty.&quot;</p>

<p>The engineer looked at her in surprise. &quot;You're right. It's
just... I'd kinda got used to having someone there for me. It
won't be fun being on my own again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not alone, Lieutenant,&quot; she offered softly.</p>

<p>&quot;That's true.&quot; Torres barked laughter and continued
sarcastically, &quot;How can anyone ever be alone trapped on
this damn ship?&quot;</p>

<p>Seven felt bitterness wash through her. &quot;You don't know
what it is to be alone.&quot; B'Elanna looked embarrassed and
the ex-drone immediately regretted her emotional outburst.
&quot;I apologise, Lieutenant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay,&quot; she replied in a subdued tone. &quot;We've all got
our problems I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>This encounter was proving to be even more difficult than
most and Seven was relieved when Lieutenant Torres said no
more and concentrated on eating her meal; it would give her
a chance to get her emotions under some semblance of
control. She picked up one of the PADDs and looked at the
data and calculations she'd carefully prepared but she
wasn't really seeing any of it, instead she was thinking
about her feelings for the woman sitting next to her.
Despite her fear she no longer had the strength to go on
deceiving herself. All her past research and observations
pointed to one thing only: she was in love with Lieutenant
Torres; it was pointless trying to deny it any longer.
Underneath she'd known for some time but had managed to
avoid confronting her feelings, focusing instead on the
sexual attraction she felt for her, but even her fantasies
had become overtly emotional lately; she couldn't delude
herself anymore. She briefly wished that she could ask the
Doctor for a cure but the only possible treatment it seemed
was time and regret.</p>

<p>Surreptitiously she watched as the smaller woman ate,
letting her gaze wander over the curious mixture of
delicate human and chiselled klingon features. She wondered
what it would be like to kiss those enchanting lips, to run
her fingers over the proud forehead ridges, to stroke that
soft, dark hair. It took all of her self-control to keep
her feelings hidden, to stop herself from revealing to the
engineer how much she'd come to mean to her.</p>

<p>B'Elanna finished her meal and pushed the plate to one
side. &quot;Okay, let's take a look at your ideas.&quot;</p>

<p align=center>* * *</p>

<p><br>As the holodeck doors closed behind her B'Elanna stopped
and almost turned around and left. What she was about to do
was morally dubious and would not go down well with the
Captain, to say the least. She reminded herself that the
only person she would be spying on was the one who had
violated her own privacy in the first place. Still, the
thought of setting up surveillance equipment on the
holodeck was disturbing and she seriously considered
abandoning the plan. There were other ways of catching the
culprit of course but a swift, positive visual
identification seemed the best way to go about it. She
ignored the voice telling her that what she <i>should</i> do was
go to Chakotay and explain the situation. Instructing the
computer to engage the privacy lock, she set her doubts
aside and began the task of installing and disguising the
monitoring equipment.</p>

<p>The work progressed smoothly and half-an-hour later she was
fixing the last wall-panel back in place. No one entering
the room would have any inkling that several visual and
audio monitors were now ready to transmit anything that
happened on the holodeck to B'Elanna's quarters. It would
be another forty minutes before the second holodeck became
available, so she decided to carry out the programming that
was necessary to activate the surveillance system when
holographic program <i>Torres simulation alpha-one</i> was run.</p>

<p>The programming complete and both holodecks now prepared
she returned to her quarters, trying not to think about the
consequences. At the very <i>least</i> this would earn her the
standard &quot;this is no way for a Starfleet Officer to behave
and you've let me down&quot; speech from the Captain. She wanted
an end to this quickly though and Tuvok's investigative
methods were reliable but slowed by his methodical approach
and adherence to protocol. She'd get her visual record and
take whatever the consequences were for her infraction of
Starfleet regulations. Besides, though she hated to admit
it, now that her initial anger had worn off she'd become
intensely curious about who had created the program. She
had absolutely no idea who onboard would want to create a
simulation of her to have sex with and she was becoming a
little anxious about what her surveillance might reveal.
What if it was Neelix? What if it was Harry? What the hell
would she do then? She'd just have to deal with that when
the time came; more than likely it was just some sexually
frustrated crewman from the lower decks. Pushing these
concerns aside, she decided to take a sonic shower before
Seven arrived. Earlier that day they'd barely scratched the
surface of her proposed modifications to the impulse drive
and she wanted to feel refreshed before once more wading
into Seven's extensive, carefully thought out plans.</p>

<p>She'd barely finished her shower and dressed when the
door-chime sounded.</p>

<p>As Seven entered she looked about the room curiously. &quot;Your
quarters are aesthetically pleasing, Lieutenant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, smiling at the phrase. &quot;But I can't
take all the credit; Tom's still got to take some of his
stuff back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; began Seven, clearly embarrassed, &quot;I didn't
mean to...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; she interrupted gently and
indicated that she should take a seat.</p>

<p>She watched as the willowy blonde perched uncomfortably on
the edge of the sofa, folding her hands in her lap, her
posture rigid. She seemed nervous and B'Elanna was
beginning to feel awkward herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Um... do you want a drink?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, thank...&quot; she paused to clear her throat. &quot;Perhaps some
water.&quot;</p>

<p>As B'Elanna went to the replicator she wondered why she
felt as if she was on a first date. She had to admit that
she was beginning to like the earnest woman sitting behind
her but that was all, wasn't it? Admittedly, underneath
that borg superiority she had a certain innocent charm...
What the hell was she thinking? This was Seven of Nine! She
shook her head as if to clear it of the absurd thoughts
that had begun to creep into her mind lately. Maybe the
break-up with Tom was affecting her more than she realised.
Retrieving the glass of water from the replicator she
squared her shoulders and tried to prepare herself for what
promised to be a difficult evening. Now if she could just
avoid any arguments...</p>

<p>Several hours later they were both considerably more
relaxed. Two glasses and an empty bottle of wine stood on
the table next to the computer console that was still
displaying a schematic of the secondary plasma injectors,
though they had abandoned their work some time ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant,&quot; murmured Seven as she leant back and closed
her eyes, &quot;I believe that the alcoholic content of that
beverage was still too high for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven opened her eyes again and looked at her inquiringly.
&quot;Lieutenant?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you to call me B'Elanna.&quot;</p>

<p>She pondered this for a second, her brow furrowed, before
replying seriously, though without her normal precise
pronunciation. &quot;I believe my cortical implant is
malfunctioning; I had forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be silly; you've just had too much to drink.&quot; She
herself felt only mildly intoxicated; she'd chosen a
low-alcohol wine with Seven's lack of tolerance in mind but
evidently it had still gone to the ex-borg's head. &quot;You
don't feel sick, do you?&quot; she asked concerned, placing a
hand on Seven's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;No, just confused.&quot;</p>

<p>The engineer snorted laughter.</p>

<p>&quot;I was not making a joke, B'Elanna,&quot; she said, her serious
tone belied by the smile that was tugging at her lips.</p>

<p>&quot;It'll wear off,&quot; she said, her thumb unconsciously
stroking the strong but delicate shoulder beneath her hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not sure I want it to.&quot; Seven sighed contentedly.
&quot;Alcohol poisoning is not unpleasant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You might change your mind about that if you ever get
really drunk.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I shall endeavour to avoid doing so.&quot;</p>

<p>A comfortable silence reigned for a while before B'Elanna
suddenly noticed her errant thumb's caressing motion and
withdrew her hand quickly from Seven's shoulder, wondering
if she'd been aware of it.</p>

<p>&quot;I have enjoyed this evening, B'Elanna,&quot; she said softly,
her eyes half-lidded.</p>

<p>The engineer swallowed nervously, realising that she had
noticed. &quot;So have I,&quot; she replied with a suddenly dry mouth
as Seven shifted her weight slightly, bringing their bodies
into contact. The former borg made a small sound of
contentment and B'Elanna had to fight the rush of desire
that came over her. It was wrong; Seven was drunk; she
didn't know what she was doing; she was too innocent to
even know what she was doing. She tried to ignore the
rebellious voice that insisted on arguing. She wasn't
<i>that</i> drunk; she wasn't <i>that</i> innocent; she wasn't a
child but a grown woman with the needs and desires of a
woman. She was more intoxicated than herself though; that
was enough. The half-klingon stood up, relieved that she
had the strength to resist something they might both
regret. &quot;Much as I've enjoyed tonight, I've got an early
start in the morning and I've got a feeling you could use
some extra regeneration time.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven took a deep breath and got to her feet as well. She
was clearly trying to hide her disappointment but the
alcohol was making it difficult. &quot;You are correct,
Lieutenant.&quot;</p>

<p>As she made her way to the door she kept to a straight line
and hardly swayed at all. She wasn't even really drunk, the
rebellious part of B'Elanna's mind insisted. She opened her
mouth to speak and for an instant she was sure she was
going to tell Seven to stay, but instead she heard herself
asking, &quot;Are you going to be all right? Do you want me to
walk you to the Cargo Bay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That will not be necessary.&quot; Despite the alcohol, the borg
shields were back in place and B'Elanna wondered if she'd
made the right decision.</p>

<p>The doors parted and Seven stepped out into the corridor.
She paused for a moment before turning round and B'Elanna
saw that her defences weren't quite at full strength after
all. &quot;Lieutenant,&quot; she said softly, her face betraying a
wistful longing, &quot;can I now consider you a friend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only if I can consider you a friend,&quot; she joked, using
humour to hide the swell of emotion that had overtaken her.</p>

<p>&quot;Agreed,&quot; the ex-borg said with a shy smile before turning
and making her way down the corridor towards the turbolift.
She watched for a few seconds, tempted to run after her
when she staggered slightly; then, with a sigh, she left
the doorway and went back into her quarters, feeling a
confused mixture of happiness and longing... and not a little
sexual frustration.</p>

<p align=center>* * *</p>

<p><br>Somewhere she could hear an insistent beeping and she
groaned and turned over in her semiconscious state but the
irritating sound continued and began to draw her further
from sleep. &quot;Computer, what time is it?&quot; she mumbled,
thinking groggily that it couldn't be time for her shift to
start already and that there must be some kind of mistake.</p>

<p><i>&quot;The time is o-four-hundred-hours and twelve minutes.&quot;</i></p>

<p>It took a second for this to penetrate her sleep-addled
mind but when it did she sat up suddenly, fully awake as if
a container of water had been thrown over her. <i>Someone was
running the program.</i></p>

<p>B'Elanna scrambled from the bed and hurried into the living
area without bothering to change out of her night-dress.
Sitting at the computer screen she activated it and swiftly
entered the codes to link it up to Holodeck One where
<i>Torres simulation alpha-one</i> was being run. The first view
was of a bedside light casting a soft, warm glow over what
appeared to be standard Voyager quarters from what little
she could see. There was an unmistakable sound of kissing
and then a moan; it was her own voice, and for a moment she
was so unnerved it took her several seconds to link to a
different monitor to get a better view.</p>

<p>A large bed; on the bed were two naked figures locked in
passion; the one on top was B'Elanna Torres; if there had
been any doubt the birth-mark in the small of the back
dispelled that. The figure underneath was a taller woman
but at first she wasn't sure who it was; she'd been
expecting a man. For several seconds her brain refused to
process the information. Long, slender limbs; pale, creamy
skin; a crown of blonde hair, stray wisps escaping from
their confinement. The left hand that had been beneath the
hologram's body caressing its breast moved round to trail
down the back and squeeze a buttock and she saw the glint
of light on metal and scar tissue. Long legs wrapped around
the hologram to pull it closer and she saw the silver star
on one of the thighs, the delicate web-like tracery around
the ankle. Still she sat there, unable to make out who the
author of the program was, or perhaps simply unable to
believe.</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna,&quot; moaned a familiar voice, low and filled with
passion, totally unlike its normal reserved tone. And
suddenly it all fell into place.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Seven.&quot;</p>

<p>She watched, frozen in place, as the Torres hologram worked
its way down, leaving a trail of kisses until Seven's sharp
intake of breath informed her that its mouth had reached a
nipple; a hand went to the other full breast, one finger
circling the large, rosy areola. Seven moaned, her eyes
closed, her cheeks lightly flushed, her mouth open to draw
in irregular sighing breaths.</p>

<p>B'Elanna stood suddenly and reached to deactivate the link.
She had recorded enough, more than enough, but her hand
hovered over the computer before slowly withdrawing. She
sat down again, watching Seven's face in fascination as the
former borg's excitement rose at the hologram's
ministrations. The ice-blue eyes opened and she looked down
at her ersatz lover. &quot;Please, B'Elanna,&quot; she gasped, &quot;I
need it now.&quot; All the emotional walls were down, her face
was naked and she'd never looked more beautiful to the
half-klingon. As the hologram resumed its path down Seven's
body B'Elanna's right hand unconsciously began to mirror
its journey, her left reaching up and caressing a breast
through her night-dress, a sigh escaping her lips at the
sensation of silk sliding over the hardening nub.</p>

<p>Now the hologram was lying between the willowy blonde's
spread legs, teasing her, kissing and nipping at the flesh
of her thighs, darting towards her mons and then moving
away. &quot;Please,&quot; Seven begged, pushing her hips up in an
effort to relieve this sweet torture. She grasped at the
hologram's head and pulled the teasing mouth in to where
she needed it. As her back arched and she let out a loud
groan B'Elanna stood again breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Not really sure what she was intending to do, she hurried
back into the bedroom and grabbed her commbadge from the
bedside cabinet.</p>

<p>&quot;Computer, lock onto my co-ordinates and initiate a
site-to-site transport: Holodeck One.&quot;</p>

<p>As she materialised in the holographic bedroom her
sensitive klingon nostrils immediately detected the heady
scent of the ex-borg's arousal. An abandoned moan came from
behind and she turned to see the scene that had been
playing out on her computer screen. Seven's eyes were
squeezed shut as she threw her head restlessly from side to
side, hair pulled into disarray. She clutched convulsively
at the silken sheets beneath her as her breath came in
shallow gasps.</p>

<p>B'Elanna should have been angry, furious even, but watching
the former borg squirming on the bed, all her inhibitions
left behind as she drew closer to her climax was somehow
strangely moving. She glanced at the hologram, reminding
herself that Seven must have broken into her medical files
to create such an anatomically accurate representation, but
it was no use, there was no anger to tap into; there was no
denying the pulse throbbing through her body and the wet
heat between her thighs. There was no denying the fierce
emotions consuming her. When she spoke she was amazed at
the calmness of her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Computer, delete holographic character.&quot;</p>

<p>As <i>Torres simulation alpha-one</i> shimmered out of existence
Seven immediately froze. For a moment the room was utterly
silent and still; then the ex-borg sat up, a look of horror
on her flushed face, drawing her legs up protectively in
front of her. For a moment they simply stared at one
another, and then Seven spoke, a tremor in her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant, I can explain...&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna almost laughed at this absurdity but something
prompted her to maintain her cold, blank expression. Part
of her wanted nothing more than to put Seven out of her
misery but another part of her, the klingon part perhaps,
took a cruel delight in her sudden power over the ex-borg.</p>

<p>&quot;I... needed... I'm sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>She slowly walked round the side of the bed, noticing the
way Seven swallowed nervously, almost tasting her scent as
she drew closer.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you need?&quot; she said coldly as she sat on the edge
of the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;You,&quot; came the hoarse reply. The former drone dropped her
gaze to her knees, unable to maintain eye contact any
longer.</p>

<p>B'Elanna struggled with herself. Now was her last
opportunity to back out of this. She could get up and
transport back to her quarters, try and forget this had
ever happened, turn her back on whatever was growing
between them, or...</p>

<p>She reached out and Seven flinched as if expecting a blow,
but when a gentle hand brushed a strand of hair aside she
looked up, her eyes widening at the tender expression on
B'Elanna's face.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you,&quot; she blurted out suddenly and immediately
looked frightened again, as if her words might break this
new spell of hope.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I'm beginning to love you as well,&quot; replied the
engineer softly and leaned forward to kiss those soft lips.</p>

<p>After a while she drew back slightly to stare into the
ice-blue eyes that were filled with wonder. It was as if
Seven had had a revelation, as if a whole new world
previously not guessed at had opened up its vistas to her.</p>

<p>B'Elanna grinned. &quot;So, which is better: a hologram or the
real thing?&quot;</p>
