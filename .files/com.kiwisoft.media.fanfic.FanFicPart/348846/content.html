<!-- My Teddy Bear \ Chapter 5 - Nightfall-->

<P>Approximately 15 minutes later, Seven finished with B'Elanna's tricorder.
B'Elanna was in a dream-like state mesmerized by the luminescence of the sunset.
She was taken out of this state by Seven's voice. "I have finished recalibrating
all three tricorders, Lt. Torres. We can now attempt to contact Voyager." </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her eyes and turned to see Seven standing over the three
tricorders perfectly placed on the ground in a triangular arrangement. "Great,
let's give it a go." B'Elanna slowly got up and headed towards Seven. </P>
<P>"Very well. But I must warn you that we can only make one attempt. After
that, the tricorders will no longer have enough power to emit a signal through
the bio-electric field." Seven began to initiate the signal. </P>
<P>"Thanks for the warning Seven." B'Elanna quipped. Seven crooked her neck up.
"I felt it was my duty to warn you." Seven totally misunderstood her. "I was
being sarcastic Seven, you know like I was in the mess hall." B'Elanna couldn't
help but laugh at the misunderstanding. </P>
<P>"I am sorry, this bio-electric field seems to be affecting some of my
implants." Seven said while attempting to balance herself on a rock nearby.
B'Elanna noticed the Borg's balancing act. "You okay Seven." To B'Elanna's
surprise, she was genuinely concerned. </P>
<P>Seven regained her composure. "I am fine. We should find out if the signal
was successful in approximately 1 minute." Seven stood up to her full height and
held her hands behind her back. </P>
<P>"Great." B'Elanna felt uneasy for some reason. There was a long moment of
silence as they waited for Voyager to respond. After about 2 minutes of silence
Seven spoke up. "I believe the signal has failed. If it had made it through we
would have heard from Voyager by now." Seven locked a stare on B'Elanna as if
waiting for orders. </P>
<P>"Well maybe they just have to figure out how to send a signal through the
bio-electric field." B'Elanna responded. </P>
<P>Seven continued her stare. "Unlikely. They have had far more time to devise a
method of penetrating the field. If they received our signal, they would have
been able to send a message directly to our co-ordinates." Seven picked up one
of the tricorders.</P>
<P>B'Elanna knew Seven was probably right. "True. So what are you doing now?"
B'Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I am scanning for any vacant caves so that we may take shelter in one after
nightfall." Seven was her usual Borg efficient self. B'Elanna couldn't believe
that she would have to spend the night in a cave with Seven. B'Elanna looked up
at the sky. "Not a cloud in the sky Seven, I think we can hold off that search
until at least tomorrow." B'Elanna to a refreshingly deep breath. </P>
<P>"Procrastination is not in my nature." Seven finished her scans. "There is a
cave 4.5 km north-east of this location." Seven looked up waiting for a response
from Lt. Torres. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was kind of hoping Seven didn't find any caves. "Okay." B'Elanna
said disappointed. "We'll head for them after Ensign Parker comes back. If it's
too dark by then, we'll just have to camp out under the stars." B'Elanna said
satisfied that Parker wouldn't return until she was sure the volatile situation
she left had calmed down. </P>
<P>"Very well." Seven started walking towards the apple patch. B'Elanna
followed. "What exactly are you doing?" She said walking up right next to Seven.
Seven simply turned her head. "I am retrieving Ensign Parker so that we may
begin our journey towards the caves I located." Seven continued to walk and talk
while B'Elanna followed. "Just a minute there Seven." B'Elanna grabbed Seven's
left arm to slow her down. "Wouldn't it be more efficient if we just waited for
her, rather than have you walk 2 km to find her, then another 2 km back here?"
B'Elanna thought she had her. "Actually, it would be more efficient if you
accompanied me there, than we could all head to the caves immediately." Seven
knew, rather than thought she had B'Elanna beat. </P>
<P>"True again. But I'd much rather stay here and wait for Ensign Parker.
Besides, you never know when Voyager may be able to send a signal through the
bio-electric field." B'Elanna was triumphant and she knew it. Seven was
disturbed that she had been beaten, for she was sure she had won. It seems the
bio-electric field was interfering more with her implants than she had
previously thought.</P>
<P>"Very well." Seven stopped and looked at her left arm, which Lt. Torres still
had a grip of.</P>
<P>"Oh, sorry." B'Elanna let go embarrassed that she had to hold onto the Borg
to slow her down.</P>
<P>"So I guess we should just sit down and wait for Ensign Parker, or a signal
from Voyager, whichever comes first, eh Seven?" B'Elanna found a smooth patch of
grass and sat down. She reached up with her right hand towards Seven. "Come on
Seven, have a seat." </P>
<P>Seven obliged, not knowing exactly why. She would have preferred to stand but
decided it was in their best interest to keep arguing to a minimum. And she knew
Lt. Torres would have made a big deal about her not sitting. So there the two
sat, B'Elanna with her hands about her knees enjoying the last of the sunset,
while Seven sat awkwardly cross-legged. </P>
