<!-- This Time Around \ Part Twenty-Nine: Your Bed Or Mine? -->

<p>***Park***</p>

<p>Faith stood and stretched, "well I'm ready to be indoors again."
Faith reached down and took Sam's hand and helped her up.</p>

<p>"You want to go home?"  Sam asked, kind of disappointed, after a few
hours of making out, saying goodbye was not what she had in mind,
nope not at all.</p>

<p>"Any other ideas?"  Faith asked, thinking home was the perfect place
to go, no audiences, and much to the surprise of others, she wasn't a
voyeur.</p>

<p>"No, guess not."  Sam said disappointed.</p>

<p>"So, your home or mine?"  Faith asked, already guessing why Sam
sounded upset.  Faith leaned down and placed a soft kiss on the lips
she was quickly beginning to love.</p>

<p>"Mine, as much as I like Nadia, I don't want her knocking on the door
at the wrong time."  Sam said as her arms snaked around Faith's neck,
pulling her down for a longer kiss.</p>

<p>"I know your parents are away, but what about Brooke?"  Faith asked
skeptically, Nadia would have to manage the stairs to get to them;
Brooke would just have to walk through the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Cheerleading practice."  Sam answered with a mischievous grin.  Sam
led Faith back to Faith's bike and they climbed on, heading to the
Palace.</p>

<p>When they finally got there Sam led Faith up to her room, and quickly
locked both doors.  "Anxious aren'tcha?"  Faith chuckled.  Sam gave
Faith by far the sexiest grin she had ever seen and then climbed
seductively on the bed.  Sitting up on her knees Sam motioned Faith
with one finger in a `come hither' fashion.  Completely unable to
resist the charms of her girlfriend Faith moved forward until she
felt her knees brush the edge of the bed.  "I love you."  Faith
whispered in awe as she closed the distance between their lips.</p>

<p>Sam's hand traveled to the small of Faith's back and pulled her
closer.  Faith taking the hint climbed onto the bed, and gently
pushed Sam back so that she was lying on top of her.  Faith looked
into Sam's eyes to make sure she was absolutely sure about this,
seeing no hesitation she closed the gap between their lips once
more.  Faith's hand traveled up the inside of Sam's shirt, gently
grabbing the Sam's breast and squeezing.  Sam moaned into Faith's
mouth and arched her body into her hand.  Faith reclaimed her lips
from Sam and pushed herself up slightly.  Taking her hand from Sam's
shirt, and smiling at the slightly confused look on her girlfriend's
face, Faith sat back on her calves.</p>

<p>Pulling Sam up she quickly got rid of Sam's shirt, followed shortly
by her own.  One they were both bare-chested before the other Faith
pushed Sam back onto the bed, the swell of their breasts pushing into
each other comfortably.  Faith's hand came down and started working
on getting Sam's pants unfastened and unzipped.  When her chore was
finally done Faith let her hand glide inside of Sam's underwear,
slightly cupping Sam's wet sex.  Sam arched her hips up into Faith's
hand.  Almost cuming when Faith's hot breath whispered in her
ear, "too many cloths."</p>

<p>Nodding in agreement Sam pushed an amused Faith off of her and jumped
up taking her shoes, socks, pants, and panties off.  She stood before
Faith in all her nakedness without shame or embarrassment as Faith's
eyes raked over every inch of her body.  "Your turn."  Faith smiled
and nodded, standing up she turned Sam so that she was by the bed and
sat her down on the edge.  Never taking her eyes from Sam's Faith
reached down and undid the button on her leather pants.  Kicking her
boots off as she started to push the leather article from her body.
Her thumbs hooked in booth the edge of her pants and panties she
easily removed both items.</p>

<p>Faith now stood equally as naked as Sam, their eyes locked together
as their hands reached out to touch and explore until now unexplored
skin.  Faith pushed Sam back on the bed, helping her scoot up some so
that they were both completely lying on the bed.  Once again Faith's
body covered Sam's, their tongue's dueling, and their hands
searching.  Faith's hand was once again on Sam's sex and she let her
finger swirl in slight circles around Sam's clit.  She slid her
finger further down and was about to enter her hot passage when Sam
grabbed her hand and stopped her.</p>

<p>"Faith I've never.I mean no one has ever.I'm a." Sam stammered, for
the first time since she and Faith started making love nervous, if
not embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Sam are you a virgin?"  Faith asked softly.  Sam nodded her head,
her teary eyes meeting Faith's.  "And you've never used your own
fingers?"  </p>

<p>Sam shook her head; "I wanted to be with someone for the first time.
totally with them."  Sam tried explaining, not sure Faith was
understanding her, not sure she was understanding her.</p>

<p>"Shh.I understand.do you trust me?"  Faith asked.  Sam nodded her
head furiously up and down.  "Then trust that I'll be gentle?"  The
water that had been gathering in Sam's eyes fell and she nodded her
head again.  Faith leaned down and kissed Sam passionately, but
softly.  Excepting the gift she was being given whole heartily.
Faith's fingers were at Sam's passage again, and Faith looked into
Sam's eyes as she slid a finger into her.  Sam was tight around
Faith's finger, and she let it sit there for a minute, letting Sam
get use to the invasion.</p>

<p>Sam wound her arms around Faith's neck and pulled her down for a
kiss.  Knowing Faith was leaving the next step in her hands, Sam
pushed her hips back, and then up, so that Faith's finger went in and
out.  Faith took the hint and started pumping her finger in a slow
rhythm so she wouldn't hurt her lover.  Faith's thumb came up and
started playing with Sam's clit, it only took a few minutes for Sam
to moan out Faith's name as she came for the first time under her
lover's skillful fingers.</p>

<p>Faith held Sam close as she fell back to Earth after her orgasm.
Whispering soft, loving nothings in her ear the whole time.  Sam
buried her head in the crook of Faith's neck and sighed happily.
Faith finally removed her finger from Sam and moved to lie on her
back, Sam following and laying her head on Faith' chest.  Sam was
idly drawing circles on Faith's abdomen when she spoke softly, "I
want to do that to you Faith.but I don't know how."</p>

<p>Faith pulled Sam closer, taking the smaller hand in her own, "then
I'll show you."  Faith led their hands down to her own pulsating sex
and instructed Sam's fingers to apply a circular pressure to her
clit.  Faith's hips quickly matched the rhythm that was set.  Sam
kissed the portion of Faith's collar bone that was close to her lips,
and looked up into the passion filled brown eyes that were boring
down on her.  Smiling and leaning up she kissed Faith, conveying with
her mouth and tongue just how much she loved her.  Faith directed
Sam's hand to push two fingers inside her wet channel, and Sam
complied.</p>

<p>Rhythmically pushing her fingers in and out she watched in awe as
Faith threw her head back and closed her eyes tightly in ecstasy.
Faith directed Sam to use another finger, and rub her clit at the
same time.  In moments that seemed like and eternity Faith came with
Sam's name on her lips, her juices flooding over Sam's hand.  "I love
you."  Sam said as she placed a kiss on Faith's sweat soaked temple.</p>

<p>Faith rolled onto her side, taking Sam into her arms and replied, "I
love you too Samantha."  Together, curled up impossible close, they
fell into a contented sleep.</p>
