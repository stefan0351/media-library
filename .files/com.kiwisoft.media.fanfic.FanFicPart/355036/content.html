<!-- Healing Our Wounds \ Part 6 -->

<p>Willow and Oz were in the van, heading for Buffy's house.</p>
<p>The gig had gone very well and the possibily of a record contract had come up.</p>
<p>"I wonder how Buffy's been. She's seemed a little different you know? Not our Buffy but out there Buffy." Willow said.</p>
<p>"Yeah. She has seemed a little..."</p>
<p>"Weird. That's exactly it. Weird. Weird Buffy, I mean normaly things are weird but she herself is relatively weirdness-free. (does her Willow sigh thing) Now, I'm not so sure."</p>
<p>Oz smiled as Willow babbeled. She kept on, mumbeling about weirdness and some sort of weirdness meter.</p>
<p>Oz stoped the van dead in his tracks as he saw Buffy lying on the ground, either unconsious or dead.</p>
<p>"Willow...we have a slayer problem"</p>
<p>"That's what I've been trying to tell you...(she looked where Oz was staring.) Oh God Buffy!"</p>
<p>They jumped out of the van and ran towards her, once there they leaned over her, looking for any signs of what may have happened.</p>
<p>Her eyes were closed, but had dark bags underneath them. Her hair was unkempt and dirty. Her skin was greyish and her cheeks sunken. And her nose, it was all bloody and so was her shirt. She was alive, but her heart was beating slowly, and her breath coming in ragged gasps.</p>
<p>"Oh my God, oh no...Buffy this isn't supposed to happen to you. You're strong remember? Slayer strong?"</p>
<p>Willow thought she had been attacked, of course that was the obvious infrence was it not?</p>
<p>"We...we have to get her to the hospital...no, we have to take her home...no we have to take her to Giles. Oh Oz what do we do here?"</p>
<p>Willow looked to him for the answer.</p>
<p>"Well, I think we should get her in the van and see what we can do. Before we get anyone else involved."</p>
<p>If Willow hadn't been so concerned about her friends well-being she may have asked herself why Oz was suddenly acting so un-Oz like. But she didn't. They heaved Buffy up and into the van, laying her down on the soft carpeted floor.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Buffy can you hear me? Oz...Oz she's not responding."</p>
<p>He went around to the back of his van and got out some first aid stuff. This was not ordinary first aid equipment though, but Willow didn't know that.</p>
<p>He took somthing out and mixed it into half a sprite that he had leftover from the road trip.</p>
<p>"This is gonna suck Buffy. Sorry." He tilted her head and poured the mixture down her throat.</p>
<p>Slowly, Buffy started to regain consiousness. She slowly opened her eyes, the were extremely red. She rubbed her nose some more and sniffeled repeatedly. Again it started to bleed.</p>
<p>Willow pulled a kleenex out of her pocket and put it up to Buffy's nose.</p>
<p>"Oh God my head hurts. Everything hurts...how the hell did I get in here?"</p>
<p>Taken aback by her response both Oz and Willow were speechless.</p>
<p>"I get it. You want to take it away don't you. Keep it for yourselves. Your not getting it from me. I'll kick the shit out of you before your greed can take over."</p>
<p>Again shock. They could not belive their ears. Was this the Buffy they knew and loved?</p>
<p>"Buffy...it's ok we just want to help you. I have no idea what your talking about." Willow choked out.</p>
<p>"Right. And I love vampires."</p>
<p>Oz was about to reply with a witty 'what about Angel' comment but wisely decided against it when he saw how pissed the slayer was.</p>
<p>Buffy had fire in her eyes now and she got out of the van.</p>
<p>"Don't try anything like that again or it'll be the last thing you do."</p>
<p>The threat had just sent Willow over the edge and she started to well up. Oz quickly embraced her and watched as Buffy stalked off.</p>
<p align="center">-------------------At Giles Place---------------------</p>
<p>"It was so weird. She accused us of trying to steal from her and then she threatened us. We were just trying to help her. She looked really bad. When we found her she was passed out on the street. It's a miracle she was alive."</p>
<p>"This is very odd indeed. Paranoia, agression. All uncharicteristic of her. Well, certianly towards her friends."  Giles said.</p>
<p>He then went over to his shelf and drew out one of many demonology refrence books.</p>
<p>"Hmmm...she could have possibly been possesed, but then she never would have been passed out in the street, if anything she would have been stronger."</p>
<p>Giles gently placed the book down on his coffee table. He removed his glasses rubbed his temples.</p>
<p>"Well, we'll stay here and help you reserch right Oz?"</p>
<p>"Actually I have to go do somthing. I'll swing by later though ok?"</p>
<p>"Y-yeah sure."</p>
<p>Oz left the apartment and headed for his van. He got in and sped off.</p>
<p>As soon as he had seen Buffy close up he knew what was wrong. The bloody nose, the sunken cheeks, the dark circles. And finally the red eyes. Not to mention the uncharicteristic behaviour.</p>
<p>A year ago Devon had the same problem. A few too many concerts, a little too much fun. It had to be drugs. He didn't want to involve everyone else, he figured this was a personal thing. She did need help though, and he was going to try to give it.</p>
<p>Oz pulled up to Buffy's house. He thought she'd be here. He got out and walked up to her door. Oz rang the bell and soon Buffy came.</p>
<p>"What the hell do you want?"</p>
<p>"Buffy...I just want to help you. Relax. I know how it is."</p>
<p>"You know how what is? You know how it is to be responsible for so much death and destruction? Do you know how it is do be responsible for Angelus? For the deaths of 2 other slayers? Do have killed one of them? To kill people?"</p>
<p>"Actually..."</p>
<p>"Don't feed me that werewolf bullshit. It's not you. It's not like you even remember it. But me...I did it I mean Faith...that was with my hands. It was a fully aware and consious decision."</p>
<p>"Buffy come on. Don't do this to yourself..."</p>
<p>"No." she interuppted him. "You don't do this to me. I don't care and I don't want to hear it."</p>
<p>Buffy slammed the door in his face and stormed up to her room.</p>
<p>'Fuck him' she thought.</p>
<p>Buffy cleaned up the mess on her bedside table and stashed what was left of her powder.</p>
<p>Satisfied that nobody would find anything she went down to the kitchen to eat somthing.</p>
<p>On the counter was a note, and a wad of cash that Buffy stuffed into her pocket. The note read:</p>
<p><i>Dear Buffy:<br> Sorry about leaving so suddenly but the gallery called and I have to go to San Francisco immediatly. If it hadn't been this importiant I never would have left you like this but I had to go. I will be home in a week,<br> Love, Mom</i></p>
<p><i>PS- There is plenty of food, but in case you run out, or just for emergencies here is some extra money. See you in a week!!</i></p>
<p>Buffy tore the note up and threw it out.</p>
<p>'Fine, I'm gonna have fun without you here.' Buffy thought.</p>
<p>Willow and Oz had found Buffy around 11, and now it was 3.</p>
<p>She ate an apple but soon found she couldn't keep it down. This didn't bother her. It was trivial.</p>
<p>'Time to get dressed.' She headed up to her room and put on some tight black jeans and steel-toed boots. A navy tank-top and the jacket finished off the ensemble.</p>
<p>Buffy went downstairs, and left the house.</p>
<p>She walked to the hospital. She had to see Faith.</p>
<p>Once in the room she sat down by the other slayer.</p>
<p>"Hi Faith." She wispered.</p>
<p>"I think you may be getting a bit better. At least that's what the doctor said. But what does he know right?"</p>
<p>Buffy sniffled.</p>
<p>"Faith...I'm falling apart. I don't know what'll happen to me but I'm chokeing. I don't think I can survive much longer. I don't think I want to survive much longer."</p>
<p>Buffy started to cry.</p>
<p>"I read your note. It's probably the only reason I'm here now even. I...shit I just don't know anything anymore."</p>
<p>"I...I gotta go."</p>
<p>Buffy stood up and walked out of the room.</p>
<p align="center">---------------------That Night-----------------------</p>
<p>Buffy made herself a small supper, and this time she managed to keep it down.</p>
<p>A few minutes after she was done cleaning up the phone rang.</p>
<p>"Hello?"</p>
<p>"Buffy, umm I need you to come over immediatly."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Trust me it is of great import."</p>
<p>With that the other end went dead.</p>
<p>Buffy used what shreds of loyalty she had left to drag herself over to Giles's place.</p>
<p>As she entered she saw Willow and Oz seated on the couch and Giles pacing nervously.</p>
<p>"What is this? The last one didn't go over to well remember?"</p>
<p>"Buffy, er..sit down. We need to talk."</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth and sat down.</p>
<p>"We are all extremely worried about you. Ever since...well since graduation you haven't been yourself."</p>
<p>Buffy smirked.</p>
<p>"Why? Because I haven't done everything you've said? Because I haven't been your attentive little slayer?"</p>
<p>"Buffy there is no need to get snappy."</p>
<p>"I don't have to listen to this."</p>
<p>She got up and left his appartment.</p>
<p>As soon as she got home Buffy went to lay down on the couch. She fell asleep almost immediatly.</p>
