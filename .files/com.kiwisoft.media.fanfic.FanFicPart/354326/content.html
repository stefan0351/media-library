<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 5 -->

<p>After having dismissed the entire crew, calling an end to tonight's supposed
festivities, Captain Janeway went right back to Seven's side. Only she, Seven,
and B'Elanna remained in the holodeck together after shoving a worried Chakotay
out, an emotional Neelix, and a concerned Doctor. Kneeling in front of Seven as
she wiped away each and every tear that rolled down her face, Captain Katherine
Janeway finally let herself feel. Seeing Seven in such a vulnerable and yet
extremely human way, Katherine Janeway realized it was more than just a close
friendship she felt for this ex-drone. She was totally and utterly in love with
Seven. Looking back, Janeway could not remember a time when she didn't feel
this way, only the times in which she denied it for the sake of something else
whether it be Starfleet or her crew. Only that wasn't true now was it? On two
separate occasions did she put her crew in extreme danger in order to save
Seven from the borg queen. On another occasion she personally risked her life
to prevent Seven from committing suicide and possibly could have left Voyager
without their Captain had Seven not come to her senses. The Captain spent more
time with Seven then any other crew member and it was only around Seven that
she could relax her role as a Starfleet captain and just be Katherine. And now
here she was stuck in the Delta Quadrant with the love of her life but denying
that love out of obligations to others. Well not any more, she was not going to
let this chance at happiness pass her by. It's been seven long years of
isolation and distancing but time just seems to keep going and going not
waiting for anyone.</p>

<p>Looking up from Seven, Janeway saw that not only was time against her but
now it seemed she had competition. B'Elanna just sat there for what seemed like
hours cradling Seven and letting her cry. B'Elanna now more than ever wanted to
kick herself for the way she had treated Seven in the past. When Seven first
came aboard Voyager, B'Elanna saw her as a drone and nothing more. The engineer
blamed her for being apart of the collective and effectively assimilating
billions not realizing that Seven was a victim too. Now it seemed that when
they all thought that at least Seven lived a happy life for the six years
before she was assimilated that wasn't the case. Little Ana was forced to
follow around her parents chasing the borg never really having a place to call
home. Not only that but it also seemed that Ana came second to her parents's
work. But now after being severed from the collective, Seven had a second
chance at living a happy, if not normal, life. And Lanna was going to make sure
that happened. She didn't know when it happened but now Lanna was sure she had
fallen in love with the ex-drone. Perhaps all of that aggression she felt
towards Seven was really just sexual tension bubbling below the surface. It had
happened before with Tom except that this time it seemed to be even stronger
and more passionate. Perhaps Seven was her one true love, the one person she
could hate yet still love with both her hearts at the same time. The only real
question that still remained was, what does Seven feel?</p>

<p>Feeling Seven's sobs beginning to quiet down, B'Elanna was brought
back to the present. She had been stroking Seven's hair, rocking her back and
forth, and placing small kisses on the top of Seven's head. Belatedly, Lanna
realized that they weren't alone in the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Seven, we should get you to sickbay to be checked out.&quot;
Lanna was again whispering gently in Seven's ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you come with me, Lanna?&quot; Seven asked in a very quiet
childlike voice.</p>

<p>With Seven using B'Elanna's nickname how could she say no. Of course
B'Elanna thought that she would have trouble denying anything to this ex-borg
but that was besides the point. The half-Klingon helped Seven up off the floor
and wrapped her right arm around Seven's waist as she led her out of the
holodeck. The Captain got up slowly feeling like a third wheel at the moment
but chalked it up to the experience Seven just went through. 'After all, Seven
and B'Elanna have gotten close lately so why not ask her to take Seven to
sickbay instead of me. Seven just probably doesn't want me to see her in such a
frail state. I'm sure she'll want to see me later when we can be alone and I
think I'll have a surprise waiting for her.' The Captain rationalized to
herself as she left the holodeck.</p>

<p>It was an hour and a half later when the doctor had finally finished his
work up on Seven and repaired whatever little damage was left from the surge of
energy to her systems. B'Elanna had stayed with Seven offering whatever comfort
she could just by being there. It was a very quiet and somber sickbay when
Janeway entered. The Doctor was in his office cataloging the work up he just did
on Seven. While the other two women stood off to the side waiting for the Doc
to dismiss Seven with a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>&quot;Doctor, how is she?&quot; The Captain asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven is physically fine with no side effects present. Emotionally is
another story. She really was affected by seeing her parents again and
remembering that particular memory for the first time. But she claims that with
an extended period of regeneration she'll be fine. Which may be true
considering this is Seven we are talking about, she deals with her pain and
then moves on but I'd rather her deal with it without the use of regeneration.
I'D prefer if she'd sit down and just talk with someone about what has happened
and allow her emotions time to run their course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's exactly what I plan to let happen, Doctor. How long can she
postpone her regeneration cycle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Seven is still pretty weak from the experience but I think that
she'll do fine without regenerating for another few hours or so, maybe even the
night but I'd rather not push it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that the Captain left the office and headed straight for the two
women.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain.&quot; Seven greeted as she saw Janeway head over towards her.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, how are you feeling? Never mind, stupid question I know, don't
answer that. The Doctor said that you are free to go so I was wondering if you
would like to have some dinner with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Captain... I... &quot; Seven seemed hesitant in answering looking back
and forth between Lanna and Janeway. &quot;I will comply.&quot; Seven finally
answered knowing Janeway only meant well.</p>

<p>&quot;Good. Then let's get out of here unless you need to do something
first.&quot; The Captain didn't comment on Seven's use of borg responses
knowing that she only did that when uncomfortable or stressed. Seven probably
was a little of both after all that had happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait! What about her regeneration cycle?&quot; Lanna commented worried
that Seven was not going to get the rest she so desperately needed and wanted.</p>

<p>&quot;The Doctor said that it would be fine if she postponed her cycle for a
few hours, Lt. Not that I would do anything to intentionally hurt Seven.&quot;
The Captain replied frostily not liking B'Elanna's protective streak at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven?&quot; The Captain questioned as she held out her arm waiting
for Seven to link her arm through her's.</p>

<p>It was now B'Elanna's turn to realize that she, too, had competition for
Seven's affection. Watching Seven and her captain leave arm in arm only made
the engineer's determination to win Seven over stronger. Little did she know,
she wouldn't have to fight very hard.</p>
