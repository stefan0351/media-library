<P>Olivia was standing in the Collages recreational hall, it had seemed like forever since she had talked to Sebastian. The night they had discussed coming to this session of group couple therapy, had been the cause of one of their biggest fights yet, adding to Olivia's argument that this therapy was needed. In the fight they hadn't actually fought but Sebastian ignored Olivia, which could be argued was no different from any other night, except to add that Olivia ignored Sebastian too. She had made no effort to convince him to come, except for taking his guitar so he would listen for all of ten seconds, so she really had no expectations of him actually showing up.</p>
<P>'<I>I should have thrown the stupid thing out the window'</I>, thought Olivia with a grin, proving that their relationship needed work, Olivia was becoming jealous of the guitar.</p>
<P>But as she looked across the room, she saw the back of an all to familiar head, Sebastian was standing by the drinks and was shifting uneasily. Olivia sighed, she felt bad for thinking he wouldn't have shown now, taking a deep breath she walked over to him.</p>
<P>"Hey you", she said, lightly tapping his shoulder.</p>
<P>"Err hey", came the all to familiar reply.</p>
<P>Olivia frowned, that wasn't Sebastian's voice that was...</p>
<P>"Viola", she said twisting Viola around.</p>
<P>"What are you doing here?", demanded Olivia, looking sternly at her friend.</p>
<P>"Look before you run off and yell at Sebastian, which he deserves. He wanted me to say he's really really sorry and that he wishes he could be here, so I offered to come", said Viola faking a smile, half the things she'd said were a lie, Sebastian couldn't care less, all he wanted to do was keep his girlfriend with minimal effort involved.</p>
<P>Olivia breathed in deeply, the shock of having her boyfriend's sister play him was just settling in and this wasn't the first time she'd felt this way either. It had been hard to suppress the feelings she had for Sebastian when Viola was him, but it was even harder to admit to them, so transferring them to the next best thing was the easiest solution, hence her relationship with Sebastian.</p>
<P>"Viola I know you mean well, but I really wanted Sebastian to be here", said Olivia, trying not to get to emotional with the messenger.</p>
<P>"And he is", said Viola motioning to her wig and tracksuit.</p>
<P>"Come on Liv, its just me. We can still have fun", said Viola winking at Olivia.</p>
<P>"I mean you payed for it already and I'll tell Sebastian everything we learn, every lesson", said Viola cheerfully, Olivia however turned on her.</p>
<P>"Every lesson? You mean he can't even make one", shrieked Olivia in disbelief, she knew Sebastian was useless at keeping promises, but this had been his final shot, she expected him to make at least some effort.</p>
<P>Viola shrugged, she really didn't know if Sebastian would come to any classes or not, but knowing her brother she couldn't stand to get Olivia's hopes up.</p>
<P>"Come on Liv, just give me a shot, please", begged Viola giving Olivia the best puppy pout she could muster.</p>
<P>Olivia hugged her.</p>
<P>"Okay, but you better not end up like your brother", said Olivia releasing her friend. They both laughed as the instructor stood up to conduct the class.</p>
<P>"First we shall begin with some stretching exercises, everyone grab your partner, and make sure your close, these can get quite intimate", said the instructor, he gave a brief laugh as everyone paired up.</p>
<P>Olivia removed her jacket and Viola couldn't help but stare at Olivia's tight tank top.</p>
<P><I>'This class might not be so bad after all'</I>, thought Viola with a grin, as Olivia and her began to stretch separately.</p>
<P><B>Authors Note: Hope you liked it... Next chapter, trust building exercises and intimate stretches, could this class get any better? You better believe it... READ AND REVIEW tell me what you wanna read and think... </B></p>
