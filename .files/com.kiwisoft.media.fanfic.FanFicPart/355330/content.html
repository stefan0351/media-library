<!-- High School Hell \ Gotcha -->

<p>"Hiya, Becky," Nicole greeted her victim with false sweetness.</p>
<p>"Yeah, hiya Becky," Mary Cherry and Lily chorused. Becky backed away nervously. They were all in the Novac and she watched with increasing alarm as Carmen locked the door. </p>
<p>"Uh, hi guys," she stuttered. The four seniors advanced on her menacingly. </p>
<p>"We know what you did to Sam," Lily said flatly. "We want to know why." </p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Becky claimed still backing up and entering the first stages of full-blown panic. Nic held up the tape recorder and pressed play. The Novac was filled with Brooke's voice from the altered conversation. </p>
<p>"That is what we're talking about," Carmen hissed.</p>
<p>"We know y'all played wit' the tape ta make poor Sammy think Brookie wuz playin' wit' her," Mary Cherry growled. Becky was all out panicking now. </p>
<p>"Pierce put me up to it!" she blurted out. "He's got it bad for Brooke, we're taking `shrine in the bedroom' stalking here. And having her turn out to be gay just made him snap!" </p>
<p>"That doesn't explain why you played with Sam's head the way you did," Nicole argued while the thought of Pierce stalking Brooke frightened her. Becky shook her head. </p>
<p>"He knows he's got no chance with Brooke but he doesn't want Sam to have her either. God, you're lucky he didn't kill Sam," the four senior gaped at Becky in shock. "He had me do the thing with the tape thinking that Sam would break up with her and that Brooke would go back to dating guys, at least she wouldn't be `evil' anymore." </p>
<p>"But why do it? What was in it for you?" Carmen asked.</p>
<p>"I love Pierce. Or I did until he lost the two marbles he actually had. I would do anything for him, but not anymore. I don't like this hurting people," Becky confessed. </p>
<p>"So what happens to Pierce now?" Lily wondered.</p>
<p>"I told his parents about his `Brooke' problem and on top of his attack on Sam, he's hopefully going to be in a psychiatric facility for a while," Becky told them. </p>
<p>"An' what `bout sweet lil' Deep Throat ov'r here?" everyone just kind of looked at Mary Cherry strangely for a second. Nicole smiled. </p>
<p>"Oh, I'll think of something, eventually." Becky shuttered to think what that could possibly mean for her. </p>
