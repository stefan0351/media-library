<!-- The Closet \ Part Seven -->

<p>Finally locating the Pollack exhibit Sam hurriedly made her way to the
janitorial closet across the hall from it.  Seeing the door slightly
ajar she tilted her head up and sent a silent thank you to the man
upstairs for the fact that her contact hadn't been spooked away when
she failed to arrive on time.  Clutching her shoulder bag closer to
her she rapidly walked over to the door, this was the type of story
that became notorious in a school's history, if Arabian Knight
presented her with the information she thought he would, she would go
down in Kennedy High history.  Plus, it would look really good on her
University application.</p>

<p>Stepping into the closet she closed the door behind her silently.  Her
heart was racing, this was so cool.</p>

<p>"Arabian Knight?" she called out, "it's Persephone," she continued
walking a bit further into the room.</p>

<p>"Over here," a voice returned.  It was the same voice she had heard
over the phone, Sam smiled to herself.  Suddenly and light flicked on,
Sam squinted and covered her eyes with her hand until her eyes
adjusted to the light.</p>

<p>"I can't see you," she said moving her head around.</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry, my bad," Arabian Knight responded directing the light so
that it was no longer shining directly in Sam's eyes.</p>

<p>"No problem," Sam responded mildly as the spots that were dancing in
front of her eyes began to disappear.  "Did you bring the stuff?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Arabian Knight responded rather indignantly.  "Would I be
here if I didn't?" </p>

<p>"Good," Sam responded.  "Shall we get on with this then?" she asked
opening up her shoulder bag and producing a notebook.</p>

<p>"Yes, let's" Arabian Knight said finally stepping out of the shadows
as he walked towards Sam.  The brunette gasped as she got her first
look at him, then stared as he continued towards her.  "What?" he
asked peevishly, self-consciously running a hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" Sam asked suspiciously getting a painful feeling in
the pit of her stomach.</p>

<p>"I told you I'm seventeen," Arabian Knight responded straightening his
back and puffing her chest forward.  Sam merely raised an eyebrow at
him, it was clear to him that she did not believe him.  "Thirteen," he
said deflating somewhat, "but I can help you," he continued quickly.
"I knew you wouldn't talk to me if you knew how young I was, but I
have information that needs to be spread and I knew that you could do
it."</p>

<p>"Does your mother know you're out?" Sam asked, as she pictured an
irate mother busting into the room and battering her over the head
while yelling about how Sam was trying to corrupt her baby.  She
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Pokemon opened today," Arabian Knight responded, "I'm good for at
least another hour and a half," he continued smiling.  "Not bad, huh?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Sam rolled her eyes.  Pokemon, oh lord.  "Let's just get on with this,
what have you got for me?" she asked wanting to get out of there as
fast as possible.</p>

<p>"Information that'll change the way school cafeteria's operate from
here to Miami," he responded placing a folder down on an overturned
box.  "Information that will shock and alarm you.  Something that will
make you question everything you ever thought you knew.  Something
that…"</p>

<p>"You do not want to finish that," Sam said holding up her hands.
"This isn't a rhetoric exam, just tell me what you know." </p>

<p>"Okay," Arabian said, but Sam could tell that he was disappointed she
had interrupted his little speech.  Oh, well, c'est la vie.  "The
information I have for you will unquestionably prove that school
cafeteria's all over the country, have for the past year been using
chemicals pilfered from school chemistry classes to artificially
enhance the products served for lunch in an attempt to reduce
spending.  And, that this disturbing trend was started by one Bobby
'Bio' Glass, at a school I think you are very familiar with," he
concluded with a smile.  "Take a look at this," he continued opening
up the folder he had been carrying with him.</p>

<p>Sam looked down at the pieces of paper then back up at him and smiled.
She had hit the jackpot and she was going to ride it all the way.</p>
