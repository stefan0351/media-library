<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 3 -->

<p>Nothing. It was an hour later and the diagnostic had revealed absolutely
nothing. The holodeck systems were functioning normally and the gelpacks
'seemed' stable, so why was B'Elanna so damned worried. With the results now
in, regardless of her reservations, B'Elanna had to report to the Captain that
systems were operational but not without a word of warning. It was now left up
to the Captain to decide whether or not to bring the holodecks on-line for the
Christmas party. Considering other factors such as the crew's desire to finally
be able to have this party, the R and R that everyone desperately needed, and
even the Captain's own curiosity to see what Seven had cooked up, the Captain
made her decision. She would trust the computer's diagnostic and allow the
party to be scheduled for the following night. Besides, if Seven or B'Elanna
couldn't find anything wrong than there probably wasn't anything wrong. At
least that's what she convinced herself of, forgetting that they were in the
Delta Quadrant and things had a way of surprising you.</p>

<p>And so the following night arrived with much anticipation, Voyager was
orbiting a small uninhabited moon in a fairly quiet region of space and only
the bare minimal skeleton crew was working (mainly those who didn't celebrate
Christmas). Janeway had given everyone else the day off in order to get ready
for the Christmas party that evening. According to Seven the attire was that of
something warm and preferably with layers. The Captain had dressed that morning
in a pair of light blue jeans with a shirt to match and then a sweater to cover
it. She also wore a pair of snow boots, a scarf, and a pair of gloves after
being able to wiggle out some hints from Seven. Everyone else seemed to have
followed suit and dresses similarly. The Captain had left Lt. Ayala (second in
command under Tuvok of the security forces) in command of the bridge. It seemed
that this time, Janeway didn't even have to make it an order for her senior
staff to attend the festivities. Even Tuvok showed a bit of curiosity, if his
raised eyebrow was any indication.</p>

<p>That night it was expected that everyone was going to arrive at the party at
various times. But what Janeway saw when she arrived in the corridor in front
of the holodeck completely threw her for a loop. The corridor was so packed
with crew members that if Janeway didn't use her captain's privilege she would
never have been able to get to Seven who was standing by the holodeck controls.
In Seven's arms was a bundled up little Naomi Wildman observing the crowd. Off
to Seven's right was standing Naomi's mother, Samantha Wildman. At first Sam
had been very reluctant to let her only child befriend an ex-borg worried that
Seven might try to assimilate her or worse. But all that changed when Sam saw
the way Seven acted when she was with Naomi. Although, Seven may not be very
good at expressing her emotions, when she was with Naomi one could see that not
only did Seven understand human emotions but she also felt them. Sam had
decided to take a lesson from her daughter and try to get to know Seven as
well, realizing that Seven was more human than most gave her credit for. Off to
Seven's left stood B'Elanna Torres, a surprise turn around. Torres was one of
the few people aboard Voyager who openly despised the ex-drone but as of late
she was singing a new tune. Even though it was some what forced, B'Elanna had
finally taken the opportunity to get to know Seven. She quickly found that
Seven was not the ice queen everyone thought she was, she just had a unique way
of showing her emotions. No one considered Tuvok to be made of ice even though
he did not display any emotions so why consider Seven in that light. The
Captain finally made it to where the group of four were standing.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, what's the hold up?&quot; Was the Captain's greeting. Even
captains can be impatient.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not time yet, Captain. The party starts at exactly 19:00 hours.
We still have 2.8 minutes left.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just thinks she wants to build up anticipation even more,
Captain.&quot; B'Elanna commented as she smiled up at the ex-borg.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Seven smiled back letting the small group know that's
exactly what she was doing.</p>

<p>The three women laughed heartily at that realizing now that Seven was even
more dangerous than before. Now this ex-drone knew the pleasures behind
torturous anticipation and she knew how to use it.</p>

<p>&quot;It is time.&quot; Seven whispered in Naomi's ear.</p>

<p>And with that, Naomi reached over to press a few buttons bringing Seven's
program on-line and in turn opening the holodeck doors. Even before the doors
were fully opened the crew began to make their way into what could only be
described as a winter wonderland. Walking into the holodeck, one would come to
stand atop of a small hill over looking a small inviting village. It was a
clear crisp evening with a full moon out in force illuminating the snow covered
ground. Scattered about in an evergreen forest clearing were small log cabin
with fires burning brightly inside. Children were playing about while their
parents watched on with glowing smiles. There were sleds to ride down the hill
on, which most of the crew immediately went to (including the Captain). There
were snow ball fights between many of the children which some of the crew got
caught up in (including Tom and Harry). And then there were the welcoming
inhabitants of the village which invited some of the crew into their homes to
talk and share hot apple cider in front of a warm blazing fire (including Sam
Wildman). Seven watched on from the archway with an ever growing smile on her
face. She was pleased that her gift was being enjoyed by all but the surprise
was not over yet. B'Elanna also stood in the archway but for different reasons.
She could not believe her eyes. This is what everyone imagined their Christmas
to be like only in reality it never was possible. The cold snow to pay in, the
warm fires to cozy up to, the hot apple cider to fill your belly, and most
importantly the friendly faces to celebrate Christmas with. Seven, the cold
emotionless drone, managed to create the ultimate Christmas town.</p>

<p>&quot;You've managed to create a whole Christmas town.&quot; B'Elanna
whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Not just a town, but a Christmas experience.&quot; Seven whispered
back hinting that the night had only just begun.</p>

<p>Just then little Naomi came running up to the two all covered in snow.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Seven. I'm going to teach you how to make snow angels. Naomi
declared as she began to drag Seven off to a drift of untouched snow.</p>

<p>B'Elanna wasn't sure if she should follow the two but after the questioning
glance she got from Seven she got her answer. By the time Lanna caught up with
Seven and Naomi, Seven was already on the ground with a huge smile on her face
waving her arms and legs about. Naomi then instructed B'Elanna to help Seven up
so that they could all see the angel Seven created. Looking down, B'Elanna
whispered in a not so Klingon fashion, &quot;An angel made by an angel.&quot;</p>

<p>But before Seven could respond a church bell off in the distance was heard.</p>

<p>&quot;We must go now.&quot; Seven instructed and led the group toward the
sound of the bell.</p>

<p>Following other groups of people, everyone eventually ended up at this very
large and long log cabin which the town's folk used as their town meeting hall.
The outside was decorated in green and red garlands strung up around the door.
Standing just inside the door was Santa Clause greeting all those who came in.
Naomi of course was to mature for Santa but Seven could detect a slight
widening of her eyes. Lifting Naomi in her arms once again, Seven brought their
small group into the huge dining hall. Inside was decorated much like the
outside using the green and red colors but also had other decorations such as
Christmas balls and tinsel, etc. In the center of the large room were long
tables in which held a banquet the likes of which not even Neelix could
imagine. (All of the food was real and waiting to be eaten thanks to Seven's
abundant amount of unused saved replicator rations; but no one had to know
about that part of the surprise.) Inside were also the town's people who were
all dressed up as little elves escorting the crew around and filling the tables
with even more food. In the center of the room across from the entrance was a
huge roaring fire keeping the room well lit and warm. Off to the left of the
fire place was a huge Christmas tree and under it tons and tons of wrapped
boxes. Real presents for the crew also supplied by Seven. If B'Elanna thought
the outside was fantastic she now had no words to describe this home away from
home.</p>

<p>Naomi looked up at that moment and saw something hanging directly above
three women. Naomi kissed Seven on the cheek and then B'Elanna explaining the
kiss by pointing up. Both older women looked up to see mistletoe hanging over
them. Naomi giggled at the looks that came over the faces of the two women and
then giggled even more as both kissed her on the cheeks simultaneously.</p>

<p>&quot;Merry Christmas, Seven and B'Elanna.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Merry Christmas, little one.&quot; Lanna answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Merry Christmas, Naomi.&quot; Seven responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Now it's your turn.&quot; Naomi prompted as she saw that Seven and
B'Elanna were not going to follow tradition.</p>

<p>Seven looked over to B'Elanna for confirmation with slightly widened eyes.
All Lanna could do was shrug her shoulders. Leaning into each other the kiss
was soft and sweet but powerful enough to leave both women dazed. But before
anything could be said or done, the Captain called to them absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt., Seven, come take a look at this.&quot; The Captain called from
where the tree and presents were located.</p>

<p>Walking over, Seven deposited Naomi with her mother and took a look at what
the problem was. The wall by the pile of presents was beginning to destabilize.
Also at that moment, Ensign Timor came running in from outside claiming that
the forest scenery was also destabilising and fluctuating to the holodeck grid
format. B'Elanna opened up an access panel near the presents and moved out of
the way so that Seven could take a look at the controls. Using her mesh covered
left hand, Seven began to perform a diagnostic on the holodeck systems.
Unfortunately, the diagnostic proved to be too much for the system to handle
and there was a large energy feedback surge. With Seven's borg enhanced hand
touching the controls at the time of the feedback, she absorbed most of the
shock. Her implants almost immediately malfunctioned especially her cybernetic
hand causing her tubules to shoot out and connect with the computer interface.
The holodeck then returned to it's normal grid format leaving the food on the
floor, the presents in the corner, and everyone standing around watching
helplessly as Seven spasmed and then collapsed into B'Elanna's arms.</p>
