<!-- Was it Just a Kiss? \ Part 1 -->

<p>"I'll take two." </p>
<p>Tom passed two cards face down to B'Elanna. Harry was studying his cards very seriously. Seven was acting very strangely, for Seven at least. She was fidgeting. Seven never fidgets. She had been fidgeting a lot more lately. B'Elanna, whom had become very good friends with her over the past several months, had noticed her fidgeting and wondered what was bothering Seven but didn't want to ask in front of the guys. </p>
<p>It was their weekly poker night. Over the past few months Seven had been relaxing a great deal and learning to make friends more easily. Not that these three hadn't always been her friends, but it had gotten to the point where she was comfortable enough to hang out with them on a regular basis. So it came to pass that she joined in their weekly poker games. Of course, Seven being Seven, she generally wiped the floor with them and cleaned up on rations, their bet of choice. Today's game was for holodeck rations. They swapped every week between replicator and holodeck rations. Seven now had the largest surplus of both on the entire ship. Everyone on board had noticed Seven's transformation over the last 3 months and a pool had started several weeks ago about who was going to be brave enough and lucky enough to gain the first date with her. Now that she seemed so approachable, many thought surely they had a chance to date her. </p>
<p>What everyone seemed to forget is that while Seven was becoming more comfortable with both herself and her life aboard Voyager, she still was very much Seven. Meaning she didn't miss much. While she was more relaxed and laid back, she could still hear a pin drop at 50 paces. Therefore Seven was very aware of the ongoing bet about who would gain a date with her first. She was also aware of the fact that Harry was planning on asking her out tonight since Harry and Tom kept whispering about it all evening. Did they think she couldn't hear them? This was the cause of her nervousness this evening. She didn't want him to ask her out. She liked Harry. He was one of her closest friends and had been one of her first friends onboard next to the Captain. She had always had a soft spot for Harry, just not in the same way he had a soft spot for her. She wasn't interested in dating Harry but she was also terrified of hurting his feelings at the same time. Who would have believed it. Seven deeply concerned about someone's feelings? As she had slowly become progressively more at one with the crew, she also became quite sensitive towards other's feelings... sometimes almost too much so. As it was, she didn't know what to do and was rather paralyzed with fear over hurting Harry. hence the fidgeting. </p>
<p>Tom had started trying to egg Harry on in hopes of bolstering his confidence to ask Seven out. Tom knew that Harry was head over heels in love with the Borg and just wanted him to be happy, even though he himself was alone these days. Tom and B'Elanna had stopped dating a while ago. Both had come to terms with the fact that they didn't belong together, but they had salvaged their friendship out of the deal. </p>
<p>B'Elanna had noticed Harry and Tom whispering to each other all evening, but wasn't sure what was up. Top that with the fact that Seven was fidgeting more and more over the last several hands, then add the extremely odd fact that she had lost the past four hands of poker and B'Elanna knew something was up. Seven didn't lose that often, generally only losing 1 hand in 4 at the most. Actually, B'Elanna had the suspicion that she only lost occasionally just for their benefit, not because she couldn't have taken the hand. However, B'Elanna knew not to ask Seven what was wrong in front of the guys, so she decided to wait until the evening was over to ask if everything was okay with her Borg friend. </p>
<p>"So Harry, what are your plans for the upcoming down time? Since Seven found this planet we are circling and the Captain has ordered everyone to take time off and enjoy the natural paradise, what are you planning to do with your three days off?" Tom not so innocently inquired while nudging Harry with his elbow. His waggling eyebrows did nothing to make him appear subtle. Harry just rolled his eyes and tried to bolster his courage a little. </p>
<p>"I'm not sure yet. Seven, what do you have planned?" Harry looked over to Seven, who had dropped her cards and was just sitting there staring at him without answering. "Seven?" </p>
<p>B'Elanna knew something was definitely off. She decided to call it a night in hopes of ditching the guys and asking Seven what was wrong. "It's getting late guys, why don't we call it a night, whatdaya say?" </p>
<p>This gave Seven enough time to formulate a response -- albeit not a good response. Seven stood as if to run out of the room. "Yes, it is late. I should be going. If you will excuse me." </p>
<p>Tom good-naturedly caught her hand as she stood and said, "What's the hurry Seven? Got a hot date planned for the evening or something? You never answered Harry's question about your plans for your 3 days of forced vacation. Come on, the Captain already specifically told both you and B'Elanna you weren't allowed to work, no matter what. Soooo. have you made any plans for what to do with your time?" </p>
<p>Harry took his queue from Tom and gathered all of his bravado. "Yeah Seven, if you don't have any plans I was thinking maybe...." </p>
<p>Tom's little speech just freaked out Seven even more and when Harry started in she completely panicked. Fear of hurting her friend's feelings just snuck up and smacked her in the back of the head. In the middle of Harry's sentence, before he could actually get the proposal out, she did the first thing she could think of to stop him from asking. </p>
<p>She kissed B'Elanna. </p>
<p>Big time. </p>
<p>Seven had suddenly taken B'Elanna into her arms, startling the hybrid, cupped the smaller woman's head in her hands and crushed their lips together in a searing kiss. </p>
