<!-- The Closet \ Part One: Day One -->

<p>Sam smiled, it was a low, sexy smile, and she saw the girl standing
across from her respond with a similar expression.  Sam reached out
her hand and crooked her finger out beckoning Brooke to come towards
her as she bit down on her bottom lip, her eyes twinkling throughout
the entire display.  To her surprise the other girl shook her head,
relaxing her stance; it became clear to Sam that Brooke didn't intend
to go anywhere.</p>

<p>"If you want me," Brooke drawled out, an impish smile gracing her
lips.  "Come and get me," she continued her tone turning teasing.  So
it was a challenge, that was fine with Sam, she loved challenges.  </p>

<p>Sam advanced on the blonde, her movements were slow and touched with
a feline grace.  She was an elegant, sleek jungle cat closing in on
her prey.  She didn't blink, she barely breathed, her entire being
focused on capturing the prize in front of her.  </p>

<p>Upon reaching her quarry, she extended her hand, she had met the
challenge and she now wanted her prize.  Brooke took a step back,
dancing out of Sam's grasp.  Sam took another step forward and
reached for her again.  Once more, Brooke stepped back, smiling all
the time.  Sam observed her for a second, quirking an eyebrow up
questioning.</p>

<p>"You're not playing fair," she commented impatiently, but there was a
somewhat petulant, almost whiny tone to her voice as well.</p>

<p>"Would you like some cheese to go along with that whine," Brooke
replied with a mockingly inquisitive expression on her face.  Her
eyes however remained amused, teasing Sam.  "Well?" she asked a
moment later when the brunette didn't respond.  Her hand dropped down
to her waist as she said this, then started to trail up her torso and
further up in-between her breasts suggestively as she watched Sam
intently.</p>

<p>"You'll just move away again," Sam responded though she began to move
towards Brooke again.  She couldn't help it, the blonde called to
her, like a moth to a flame.</p>

<p>"You'll never know unless you try," Brooke responded.  Her finger was
now in her mouth, the tip of it resting on her bottom lip innocently —
 in a Catholic schoolgirl in porn kind of way, that is.</p>

<p>Sam moved towards her once again, reaching out as she stepped up to
Brooke.  This time the blonde didn't step back, instead she relaxed
her body letting Sam pull her into her so that they were soon nose to
nose.  They observed each other for a moment, Sam's head leaning
forward then pulling back again in uncertainty, her lips hovering
just in front of Brooke's.  The blonde smiled as she watched the
display, her tongue jutting out to lick her bottom lip.</p>

<p>"Come on Sam," Brooke said, her tone was soft but serious, it had
lost the teasing edge that had coated all of her previous
statements.  "You know you want to," she continued, "why don't you
practice what you preach."  </p>

<p>Sam was still for a moment after Brooke spoke, then without further
ado she leaned in and brought their lips together.  The contact was
hesitant at first, but in a short period of time their embrace became
increasing heated.  Their lips crashed against each other, their
bodies straining to increase the contact between them.  Their hands
roamed each other's bodies, skin on skin, skin of cloth, caressing
and exploring in a desperate haze.</p>

<p>The next thing Sam knew, they were lying on her bed and they were
both completely naked.  Brooke was draped over her body, covering
almost every inch of her.  She found that her own hands were trailing
up Brooke's sides, towards her now fully exposed chest.  She arched
up into Brooke's hands, scarcely aware of the guttural sounds being
emoted from her own throat.</p>

<p>"Who do you want?" Brooke whispered into Sam's ear as her hands
expertly manipulated the brunette's body.  Sam was too preoccupied to
respond.  "Who do you want?" Brooke repeated, ceasing her movements
and looking at Sam intently.</p>

<p>"You," Sam moaned desperately as Brooke's hand began to trail below
her waist and her hips expectantly.  "I want you."</p>

<p>Sam bolted up into a sitting position, her chest heaving as she
blinked rapidly.  She braced her hands on the side of her body and
closed her eyes taking a few deep calming breaths.  When she
eventually she managed to get her breathing somewhat under control,
she sighed dejectedly and flopped back down on the bed.  Dammit, not
again!  She couldn't freaking believe it, this was the fourth night
in a row she had had the same dream about Brooke – well not exactly
the same dream as they had gotten increasingly more graphic as time
went on – and it was starting to piss her the hell off.  Not only was
she haunted by Brooke for most of her waking hours, but now her
unconscious had joined in too.  It was a damn conspiracy.</p>

<p>She turned her head to the side.  The phone was ringing.  She
smirked, not only was she glad to have the distraction, but she if
this was the call she thought it was, she had been waiting for it for
what seemed like eons and it couldn't have come at a better time.
There was no more time to think about the meaning of her Brooke
dreams, she had bigger fish to fry, greener pastures to move on to
and all of that wonderful stuff.</p>

<p>"Hello?" she said hurriedly picking up the receiver, speaking into it
before she even had the other end at her ear.</p>

<p>"Persephone?" the voice on the other end asked.  The voice was
unmistakably male, but Sam had already expected that, what threw her
momentarily was tone which wasn't nearly as deep as she had expected
it to be.</p>

<p>"Arabian Knight?" she asked, shaking her head at the codename once
again.  That one always cracked her up.</p>

<p>"Is Operation Sizzler still a go?" Arabian Knight asked, his voice
dropping secretively.  Sam could almost picture him looking around
his surroundings furtively, keeping an eye out for Fibbies in black,
or places that could be easily bugged.</p>

<p>"You tell me?" Sam responded.  "Everything's five by five on my end,"
she continued deciding to play along with espionage-ese for the
moment.</p>

<p>"The Museum of Modern Art, the janitorial closet across from the
Pollack exhibit 8:00 pm," he responded.  "Be there," he intoned
seriously, "or be square.  Arabian Knight out."  This was followed by
the irritating buzzing of the dial tone.  Sam rolled her eyes and
replaced the phone on the hook.  He was goofier than she expected,
but that didn't matter to her as long as he could deliver the goods.</p>

<p>"Sam," she heard her mother call through the door as she rolled out
of bed.  "Get up, your going to be late," she continued.</p>

<p>"It's only 7:30," Sam called back as she ran a hand through her hair
and rubbed at her eyes.</p>

<p>"That may be so, but Brooke's already dressed and eating breakfast.
You don't want to miss the bus," Jane replied.  </p>

<p>"I'll be down in a minute," Sam responded.  Soon after that she heard
her mothers footsteps retreating down the hallway and she let out an
exasperated breath.   "Brooke's already dressed and eating breakfast"
she repeated sourly in mocking tone as she stomped towards the
bathroom.  She hadn't even been wake for half an hour and already
Brooke was haunting her.</p>
