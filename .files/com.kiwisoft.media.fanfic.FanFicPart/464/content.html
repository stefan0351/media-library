<p>"But Christmas is a part of your heritage, Seven," the Captain
			patiently explained, fervently wishing now that Harry hadn't raised
			the subject at the end of the morning meeting.  Seven had hung back
			as the others departed and, overheard by B'Elanna had asked the
			Captain for her thoughts on the season.  As the idea of the ex-Borg
			taking in this information seemed to fascinate B'Elanna, she had
			stayed behind also.  Twenty minutes later, however, explaining
			Christmas to Seven was not proving an easy thing to do.</p>
		<p>"But I fail to see why placing a dying tree in the Mess Hall,
			dressing it in over-shiny objects and singing around it while it dies
			is a good thing to do," stated Seven.</p>
		<p>"Because it's tradition, and it's fun," the Captain said wearily.</p>
		<p>"Fun!" counteracted Seven with a very slight smile.  "Fun is a
			concept the Borg had very little if no time for."</p>
		<p>It was obvious to two of the three people in the Conference Room that
			this present discussion about Christmas and its part in Seven's life
			was going nowhere.  Placing two hands on the table before her,
			Kathryn pushed her seat back and got to her feet.  "I blame Harry for
			all of this," she said with feeling.</p>
		<p>"For Christmas?" asked B'Elanna, disbelievingly.</p>
		<p>"No, silly," chided Kathryn gently, "for putting the idea in Seven's
			head that she should try to celebrate the season."</p>
		<p>"Oh, that."</p>
		<p>Seven sat starting from woman to woman, still no nearer to knowing
			what her involvement in Christmas was about although, by now, the
			religious significance and the 'trimmings' had been explained to
			her.  She looked over to the Captain, who was now standing gazing out
			at the stars with her back to the others.   Still needing
			clarification she said, "Captain, please explain why I should feel
			the need to stand around a dying tree, and be nice to everyone." </p>
		<p>Her Captain sighed and turned around to face her; putting her hands
			behind her back Kathryn leaned against the window, and tried once
			again to get through to her annoyingly enchanting
			crewmember.  "Seven, I've explained Earth's religious significance as
			well as the festivities that we practice on board ship, for those who
			wish to partake.  What else can I tell you?"</p>
		<p>"You might explain why it's deemed necessary to express excess
			fondness for fellow crewmembers on Christmas day."</p>
		<p>"Because we are showing that we care for them, Seven," the Captain
			explained, practically devoid of all feeling by now.   Moving with
			some purpose towards the replicator she placed a semi-desperate order
			for a much-needed brew.  She raised her eyebrows in a silent question
			to the others and, as B'Elanna and Seven declined, Kathryn wrapped
			both hands gratefully around the steaming hot coffee and stared at
			Seven, sure it would not all end there.</p>
		<p>"But, why choose one day for these demonstrations, couldn't we show
			that we care and give them gifts throughout the year?"</p>
		<p>"That'd be nice, Seven," answered B'Elanna, "but people don't usually
			tell each other how much they care in daily life."</p>
		<p>"Perhaps they should."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, you're right.  But they don't, OK?  So Christmas is nice."</p>
		<p>"And the dying tree?"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna and the Captain both sighed heavily, looking at each other
			for moral support in their frustration.  "I think we might be missing
			the point here," the Captain explained, "Seven, Christmas is about
			love, it's about unconditional love; forgiveness; giving and
			receiving; remembering that someone was born once who came to teach
			us how to love."  </p>
		<p>B'Elanna looked impressed with the Captain's simplicity after all
			this time of trying to explain the details.</p>
		<p>"Then I shall have to forgo the celebrations, Captain," answered
			Seven with conviction.</p>
		<p>Why, Seven?"</p>
		<p>"Because the bulk of my life has been spent with the Borg, and love
			was not part of their curriculum.  I am unqualified."  Seven got up,
			turned around and left the room.</p>
		<p>"But," objected Kathryn to her receding back.</p>
		<p>"Don't waste your breath, Captain.  Some things can't be altered.
			You had a good try, though."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm not about to give up on her, Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>There was no argument about that and B'Elanna said, "Yeah, well.
			I'll see you later," leaving Kathryn wondering how to integrate Seven
			and Christmas: it would be two days and a lot more coffee before she
			realised she was hatching a plan.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Janeway to Lieutenant Torres."</p>
		<p>"Here Captain."</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna, are you free tonight?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, why?"</p>
		<p>"Some of us are meeting in my quarters later, to discuss the `Getting
			Seven in the Christmas Spirit' problem.  Are you in?"</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't miss it, Captain.  What time?"</p>
		<p>"19.00."</p>
		<p>"See you later.  Torres out."</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>If Seven of Nine had noticed anything recently it was that in the
			past few days, whenever she approached any of the Bridge crew or
			Lieutenant Torres, they smiled in a knowing sort of way.  Whenever
			she enquired as to why this was, she was told she was imagining
			things and the subject was quickly changed.   She wondered, at times
			like this, if she would ever understand people.</p>
		<p>Her shift in Astrometrics over, Seven headed off to Cargo Bay 2.
			Today was what the crew called `Christmas Eve' and the singing of
			carols around the tree in the Mess Hall would take place soon for
			those who wished to attend, with a festive party following.  With the
			Captain's surprising approval, she had excused herself and would now
			use the time to study some padds of recent star system additions and
			then regenerate.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Is everything set?"  Chakotay enquired of the Captain.</p>
		<p>"Relax," said B'Elanna, "we all know what to do."  </p>
		<p>The Captain nodded her agreement to that statement and then left her
			small huddle of partygoers and moved further down the Mess Hall to
			approach Tom, who was in the process of chatting up a rather pretty
			young woman.  Placing a hand on Tom's arm, she excused herself to the
			woman and asked, "Transporters and Holodeck all standing by?"</p>
		<p>"Yes ma'am."</p>
		<p>"'Til a quarter to midnight then, Mr Paris," she said as she smiled
			her apologies once more to the pretty ensign and departed.  Returning
			to the others, she looked around the static faces and said,   "We
			have a few hours before we go into action, what say we enjoy
			ourselves?"</p>
		<p>"Is that an order, Captain," smiled Chakotay.</p>
		<p>"I'd say it is."</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>Seven could have sworn someone had touched her.  However, quick sweep
			around the Cargo Bay, with the computer confirming her status as the
			only occupant, assured her she was definitely alone.  Her
			regeneration cycle had been interrupted and she couldn't understand
			why.  Quickly and efficiently, she ran a diagnostic of her alcove, to
			be met with an assurance from the Computer that all was well.</p>
		<p>Frowning, Seven stepped back towards her alcove and was about to
			attempt to regenerate once again when she heard the sound behind
			her.  Turning, the ex-Borg let out a gasp of surprise for there,
			before her, was what could only be termed as `a vision'.</p>
		<p>The `vision' was that of a Borg drone but completely grey in colour
			and translucent; she could actually see the stored containers right
			through it.  A giant chain was coiled all around the spectre's `body'
			with heavy weights hanging from it, weights that dragged along the
			floor, impeding its slow but certain movement towards her.</p>
		<p>Seven tapped her combadge.  "Intruder alert, Cargo Ba."</p>
		<p>"They will not hear you," boomed the spectre, "it has been
			disconnected."</p>
		<p>"Wh - Who are you?" asked Seven, clearly unnerved, "and what do you
			want with me?"</p>
		<p>"We represent the combined spirit of the innocent beings that make up
			the Borg.  It has come to our attention that you need our help."
		</p>
		<p>"I don't understand."</p>
		<p>"We have come that we might help you to turn your life around, so
			that you may be freed of a loveless, joyless, humourless existence
			and know at last an open heart.  With such a heart you may experience
			love - the true spirit of Christmas.</p>
		<p>"I am grateful for your concern, but I assure you."</p>
		<p>"And we assure you, Seven of Nine, we shall not leave until we tell
			you all that we have come to say."</p>
		<p>"Then you had better proceed," agreed Seven, looking around the Cargo
			Bay and showing in her body language a slight annoyance at this
			being's insistence.</p>
		<p>"This night, you will be visited by three spectres," delivered the
			apparition, slowly backing away towards the far wall of the Cargo Bay
			as it spoke.  "Expect the first at midnight.   The second will come
			at 01.00 and the third." as it spoke of the third, it was already
			disappearing through the Cargo Bay wall, "the third will come shortly
			after.  Watch for them." </p>
		<p>Seven stared at the area of the wall where the apparition had passed
			through it.  She was a discerning creature, possessed of sound mind
			and reasoning, but she could not for the life of her work out what
			she had just seen.  She considered reporting to the Doctor until she
			remembered he would probably be at the party: if he had gone
			to `enjoy' himself, she certainly had no wish to draw him away over
			something she could barely explain.  </p>
		<p>Seven reasoned that as the computer had failed to register an
			intruder, it must have been her mind's work and therefore no threat
			to the ship.   Walking back to her alcove, she stepped gratefully
			inside the known state and entered oblivion.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Oh, well done Tom.  It looked so real.  I'm sure she was taken in,"
			Kathryn congratulated.  "How did you do it?"</p>
		<p>"Simple projection, Captain.  What's she doing now?" Tom asked over
			the com. from Engineering, as he busied himself with the next part of
			their programme.</p>
		<p>Kathryn studied the viewscreen on her desk in the Ready Room.  Minute
			cameras had been set up in the Cargo Bay and on Holodeck 1 so the
			Captain could monitor Seven's reactions.  "She's moving back to her
			alcove, she's going to continue regenerating."</p>
		<p>"Good," cut in B'Elanna, interrupting Tom's reply to the Captain.
			Her engineering space seemed full with Tom in it, and she jostled to
			get nearer to the com.  "Let her begin the cycle again; she has no
			concept of time in there and we've set the computer to give her a
			false reading if she tries to ask."  B'Elanna was referring to the
			fact that they would be bringing the three spectres reasonably close
			together and not at hourly intervals, thus ensuring they all got to
			sleep at a reasonable hour.</p>
		<p>"OK," agreed the Captain.  "By the way Harry," she said to the ensign
			at her elbow, "that was a great device for waking her.  Who'd have
			thought a jet of air aimed at her face would be enough to do the
			trick."</p>
		<p>"Just ask me, Captain," glowed Harry, loving the praise.</p>
		<p>"OK everyone, stand by," barked the Captain into the com  "Tom, make
			your way to the Holodeck control room and join us on this comlink.
			Are you sure you can transport her to the Holodeck without her
			waking?"</p>
		<p>"Uh, no, actually," cut in B'Elanna, "but we'll do our best.  It
			wouldn't really matter if she did wake so soon.  We're ready."</p>
		<p>"Well then people, let's do it!"</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>Once again, within a short space of time, Seven was aware that she
			was awake.  "Computer, what time is it?" she questioned.  </p>
		<p>
			<i>The time is midnight</i>
		</p>
		<p>Seven looked around nervously.  She'd hoped that what she'd seen
			earlier would be all she would see.  Stepping away from her alcove,
			she became aware of a light growing brighter in the room, causing her
			to place a hand in front of her eyes to shield them from it.  "Who is
			there?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.  I am come that you might see the
			Christmases of old and be reminded of your joy at those times."   The
			light slowly eased enough for Seven to be able to look at the
			spectre: she saw a female form in a long white dress, with light
			exuding from its face and head.  "Take my hand," it said.</p>
		<p>Seven was about to object - she didn't understand any of this, or why
			this being had come to her, but something within her ached to see her
			past and so, cautiously, she reached forward and took the hand that
			was offered to her.  </p>
		<p>Suddenly the Cargo Bay around Seven changed into a living room with a
			large Christmas tree in the corner, lit up with coloured lights, with
			a man and woman sitting on the floor before it.  The woman turned her
			head and gestured for a child nearby to join her.  Seven watched as
			the child ran over to the woman and received a hug before being
			handed a large colourfully wrapped box. </p>
		<p>"From the files recovered from `The Raven', I know this to be my home
			in the Tendara colony, and these are my parents."  Seven stared at
			the spectre,  "How is this possible?"</p>
		<p>"All things are possible in love, child," answered the spectre as
			Seven continued watching the child rip open the box to discover a
			pair of ice skates.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I remember those!" shouted Seven, who covered her mouth
			quickly.  "Can they hear us?"</p>
		<p>"Neither hear nor see.  We are invisible to them as we are not of
			their time."</p>
		<p>"I understand, I have had some temporal training."  </p>
		<p>Seven watched as the child clambered ungraciously across her mother
			to hug her father, who was still on the floor beside them.  "Oh,
			papa, they are so beautiful. Thank you, thank you.  Thank you mother."</p>
		<p>"You're welcome, my love," said little Annika's father, hugging his
			daughter warmly.  "If the rink is open tomorrow, I'll take you
			skating then."</p>
		<p>"Oooohhh, Daddy, will you?"</p>
		<p>Magnus looked at his little girl and met eyes as blue as his
			own.  "If you're good, poppet."</p>
		<p>"I will be," promised Annika as she left her father's arms and delved
			into a pile of gifts under the tree.  "This is for you," she said
			proudly, holding out a small package to her mother.</p>
		<p>"Oh, darling. Thank you," said Erin, taking the package and
			unwrapping it carefully.  Seven watched and, knowing what would come
			from the box, she held her breath as did the child Annika.  "Oh Anni,
			it's beautiful," cried Erin as she held the wooden pendant towards
			her husband so that he could see, knowing full well he must have
			helped Annika to carve it.  "I love it.  I shall love it forever,"
			she said, taking her child in her arms and hugging her thoroughly.</p>
		<p>Seven watched the scene before her.  It had brought a lump to her
			throat as she'd begun to remember the love that had abounded in that
			house, and the joy she had felt often in her young life. It was a far
			cry from the woman she was today, and a bittersweet tear escaped from
			her human eye in response.</p>
		<p>"Time to move on," said the spectre, touching Seven's arm.  The scene
			around them changed again to the inside of the `The Raven', the deep
			space vehicle on course to meet the Borg.  It was another Christmas
			Day but the scene was very different.  The child, Annika, was alone
			in her room as her parents worked on calculations and processing data
			they had received earlier in the day. </p>
		<p>"Papa? Mother?  I'm lonely, come and play with me," asked little
			Annika from the doorway of the small Bridge.</p>
		<p>"We're busy right now, poppet," answered Magnus.  Erin turned her
			head towards her child to give an apologetic smile and added, "We'll
			come and see you soon.  Go back to your room and play with your new
			things, there's a good girl."  Both parents turned back to give their
			full attention to the work in hand, as little Annika studied them
			sadly for a while and then returned to her room.  Sitting on the bed,
			she dragged a large stuffed toy to her and hugged it under her chin
			as her tears silently fell on its fur.</p>
		<p>"The girl is far away from home and separated from her friends, and
			her family is not available to her.  In effect, she is alone," said
			the spectre to Seven.  "Weep for her, if the tears will come."</p>
		<p>"Please, take me away," said Seven, in a quiet voice.  "I have seen
			enough: her hurt is too close to who I am today."  </p>
		<p>The spectre looked gently upon the pain in the woman's eyes and took
			pity on her.  Waving its hand around in an arc, the view suddenly
			reverted to that of the Cargo Bay and Seven slumped at the foot of
			her alcove and wept, alone again.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Do you think we've gone too far?" asked the Captain worriedly,
			through the comlink in her Ready Room. </p>
		<p>"If it doesn't hit home, it's not going to work," said Harry softly,
			standing behind his Captain as she sat, with his hand on her shoulder
			for moral support.</p>
		<p>"I'm sure you're right," Kathryn answered, patting his hand, "but
			this isn't about hurting her."</p>
		<p>"What's she doing, Captain?" asked B'Elanna who was busy altering and
			realigning some of the technology that was making this deception
			possible.</p>
		<p>"She's crying, Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna registered the Captain's hoarse voice, but answered, "I'm
			with Harry on this one.  We have to hit her to make the impact."</p>
		<p>"Well, I hope you're right.  Tom?"</p>
		<p>"Yes Ma'am," replied Tom, who had moved to the Holodeck control
			room.  </p>
		<p>"Stand by for the next part.  Oh, and - you're doing a great job."</p>
		<p>"It was all there for us Captain, on the padds and slides left by the
			Hansen's - only a matter of putting them into a Holodeck programme."</p>
		<p>"Well done anyway.  Stand by."</p>
		<p>"Aye, Captain."</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>Seven's alcove had ceased to function yet again and her look of
			apprehension was immediate; she had no idea how long she had
			been `allowed' to regenerate this time.  "Computer, what time is it?"
			she asked.</p>
		<p>
			<i>The time is 01.00</i>
		</p>
		<p>It wasn't long before Seven was protecting her eyes again as another
			flood of light hit the Cargo Bay.  Squinting through her hand, she
			could make out a figure: a rather rotund gentleman with a long white
			beard, dressed in a flowing green robe decorated with white
			fur.  "Seven of Nine," called the spectre, holding out its hand as
			the brightness eased.</p>
		<p>Seven looked over at the apparition which, unlike the last, appeared
			solid.  "Who are you?" she asked, "As the previous spirit was the
			Ghost of Christmas Past, am I to assume you the Ghost of Christmas
			Present?"</p>
		<p>"How clever of you, my dear.  I am.  Come."  It stretched out a hand
			towards Seven and, somewhat resigned, she stepped forward to take
			it.  As she did so, the scene around them changed to the Mess Hall,
			with an obviously happy gathering of the crew seated around a festive
			meal.</p>
		<p>"What day is this?"</p>
		<p>"Why, it's Christmas Day, child."</p>
		<p>Seven looked around the Mess Hall.  Neelix was in his element,
			providing the food for all the people he held dear.  Some tables had
			been pushed together where the Bridge crew had gathered and were now
			laughing, pulling crackers and opening gifts given in friendship and
			love.   Squeals of joy abounded, as gratitude spilled out into the
			room.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Chakotay!"   Kathryn held up a fine, blue/grey long scarf, silk-
			like and soft, and put it against her face.</p>
		<p>"There," he said happily, "I knew it would match your eyes."</p>
		<p>"Oh!  How did you manage such a thing!" asked an obviously delighted
			B'Elanna to Harry, as she pushed aside the wrappings and found her
			gift. </p>
		<p>"No sweat, Maquis.  I had Chakotay help me replicate it," he said of
			the perfect model of the Maquis ship that had brought B'Elanna to the
			Delta Quadrant.  She held it lovingly in her hands.</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful Starfleet, thanks."</p>
		<p>Seven watched as gradually more gifts were opened.  She could see the
			thought that had gone into them and the obvious delight they
			brought.  Suddenly the Captain tapped a spoon against her glass as
			she remained seated and said,   "I want to propose a toast, to all
			you wonderful people - who it is my total misfortune to be loose in
			the Delta Quadrant with - a toast, for a Merry Christmas!"  </p>
		<p>"Merry Christmas," they replied and they drank their toast, watched
			by some others in the Mess Hall, who tilted their glasses in the
			general direction of the Captain's table.</p>
		<p>"And of course, there are others we have to remember on this day,"
			Kathryn continued.  Tuvok looked down, thinking of his family; Harry
			smiled as a picture of his parents' faces popped into his mind.  Most
			of the crew had a face of a loved one in their minds.  Kathryn
			herself was thinking of Mark, her mother and sister Phoebe.  </p>
		<p>B'Elanna was thinking of Seven.  "I have a toast," she said.  Looking
			at her, the others smiled in a questioning sort of way and raised
			their glasses in readiness once more.  "To Seven of Nine."</p>
		<p>Tom looked up sharply.  "Well I'm not toasting her," he said, fending
			off the looks he was getting from those present at the
			table.  "What!  She'd hate this!  She's always so scathing about such
			get-togethers.  She totally ignores Christmas and scorns those of us
			who enjoy it."</p>
		<p>"Because she doesn't know how to join in, Tom.  If she could let her
			barriers down, you'd see a different Seven, I know.  But you don't
			have to join in."  B'Elanna raised her glass once more and said, "To
			our absent cewmember.   I wish she could share in our joy one day."
			B'Elanna looked around the table and met a sea of nodding faces, even
			Tom's.   "To Seven," she said again.</p>
		<p>"To Seven," agreed the others and drank the toast.</p>
		<p>Seven stared at B'Elanna, not understanding why she had received this
			level of attention from a woman who fought frequently with her.  To
			all intents and purposes, this woman hated her.  That she should do
			this.  It touched Seven deeply, so deeply she'd reached out and held
			the sleeve of the spectre beside her, holding on to the being for
			comfort - and, even though it was a ghost, it did indeed comfort her.</p>
		<p>The Captain was on her feet.  She had asked for the attention of the
			entire room and was now speaking.  "I'm sure we all wish to give our
			thanks to Neelix, for this wonderful food, provided to his usual high
			standard.  A triumph, Neelix!"  Everyone in the room began applauding
			the little Talaxian, whose face began to rival his more outrageously
			coloured suits.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, everyone," he said before busying himself over the
			tidying up, helped by Sam Wildman and a few eager crewmembers.</p>
		<p>"And thanks to each of you," the Captain continued, looking around
			the room, "for coming together in the spirit of Christmas, sharing
			with each other the fullness of our hearts on this special day.
			Bless you all, every one," said Kathryn, raising her glass to the
			room in general.</p>
		<p>"It is indeed a warming sight," said Seven to the spectre by her side.</p>
		<p>"Hum, what?  Aren't you the one who said ` Happiness is Irrelevant'?"
			mentioned the spectre, airily.</p>
		<p>"I thought it served no useful purpose," Seven explained quietly.  "I
			was wrong."</p>
		<p>"Well then girl, there's hope."  The spectre clasped his hand to her
			back warmly.  "If you had remained unaltered by these events, then
			all of this would have served no useful purpose."</p>
		<p>The spectre's last words seemed to echo, as the room around Seven
			became once again the Cargo Bay.  Wearily and in a somewhat
			reflective mood, Seven approached her alcove for the third time,
			knowing for certain this time that she would be interrupted again.
			She stepped up to assume her position, but was distracted by a dark
			shape and slight movement just out of the corner of her eye.
			Turning, she found herself staring in abject horror at the spectre
			before her.</p>
		<p>"And you must be," Seven said, trying to keep her voice even, "the
			Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come."  The spectre, dressed in a flowing
			black robe with a cowl over its head so as to render its face
			unavailable to prying eyes, held out a long willowy index finger and
			pointed.  "You wish me to go with you," Seven stated, "but I find
			myself afraid.  Can you assure me I will remain emotionally
			undamaged?"</p>
		<p>The spectre simply stood before Seven, as silent as the grave, and
			pointed until the frightened woman resigned herself to do its
			bidding.  "I will comply," she said shakily, moving forward.  As she
			did so, the scene around her changed: it was a room aboard Voyager, a
			room with a coffin in the corner of it, with a small group of people
			gathered around it.</p>
		<p>"Well, somebody must read the words," said the Doctor.</p>
		<p>"No-one liked her.  I'm her Captain; I should do it," said Kathryn
			Janeway, moving forward and standing before the others.</p>
		<p>"I have never heard the Captain speak ill of the dead.  The woman I
			know would not do such a thing," Seven stated to the spectre, "and
			what does this scene have to do with me?  Why have you brought me
			here?"  The spectre simply stood, maintaining it's ominous silence
			and a shiver ran down Seven's back as she turned to watch the
			proceedings in the room.  "Show me some feeling from these people
			connected to this poor wretch," she asked.</p>
		<p>Listening further to the `ceremony', Seven became aware that the
			person in the coffin had been considered a problem to many
			present.  "Why wasn't she nicer in life?" someone questioned of the
			others, "If she had been, we could feel a slight bit moved about her
			passing."</p>
		<p>"I don't think there's a person aboard who she didn't upset," offered
			Tom Paris.  "It would be hard to be anything but glad to see the back
			of her."  This comment was met by various murmurings of agreement.</p>
		<p>Seven turned to the spectre once again, the colour lacking in her
			face.  "When I said show me some feeling, I didn't mean bad feeling.
			Is there anyone here with a kind word to say about her?"</p>
		<p>The spectre stood silently and then raised its hand, pointing in a
			different direction.  Seven's eyes followed and came upon B'Elanna
			Torres who was sitting on the floor with her back against a table,
			crying softly.  "She cannot see me?" Seven asked of the spectre.
			Receiving no answer, she decided the rules must be the same as for
			the previous two ghosts and she walked softly over towards B'Elanna
			and squatted down beside her.</p>
		<p>"I loved her so," sniffed B'Elanna, rocking slightly in her
			grief.  "She never knew because she never opened up enough to let me
			in, and it's too late now.  I should have confessed my love - maybe
			it might have changed her, changed this outcome."  </p>
		<p>B'Elanna sobbed from her centre and Seven's eyes clouded.  Looking
			back at the spectre she pleaded, "Tell me of whom she speaks!"
			Wearily, she knew she would hear nothing in the way of explanation
			from the apparition as she stood and faced it.  "There's nothing more
			I need to see here," she said with some finality.  "Take me home."</p>
		<p>At the same instant Seven finished the words, she found herself
			floating in space and yet somehow able to breathe, with the spectre
			beside her.  Before her was the coffin that had been jettisoned from
			Voyager a moment earlier.  "I asked to go home," she whispered, her
			blue eyes a study in fear, but there was no answer and no reaction to
			her request.  "Please, I am afraid."
		</p>
		<p>When nothing was forthcoming Seven resigned herself to her current
			situation, knowing instinctively that she would have to see it
			through to its conclusion. "Who is she who resides in this coffin?"
			Her heart quickened as the spectre once again gave an ominous point,
			clearly suggesting she should look for herself.  Seven moved closer
			to the coffin and peered in through the small window at the face
			within: she already knew whose face it would be.</p>
		<p>"Must these things definitely come to pass, or can they be altered?"
			she asked quietly of her companion, whose silence was beginning to
			unnerve her badly.  "Pity me, spirit," she pleaded, "for I am not the
			person I was. If I conduct myself differently from this day on, will
			the outcome change?  Please, does it have to be this way?"</p>
		<p>Deeply distressed, Seven looked back to the coffin and wrapped both
			arms around it in an embrace, almost attempting to warm the occupant
			and bring her back to life. "If I cannot change the outcome then
			exchange me now for the body in the coffin, do not be so cruel as to
			allow me to continue in life through to this conclusion."</p>
		<p>Seven was no longer looking at or paying attention to the spectre.
			Her grief was all consuming as she held the coffin and
			repeated, "Please, I want to live.  Give me a chance; I have
			changed.  Please."</p>
		<p>Slowly, the walls of Cargo Bay 2 began to materialise around the
			sobbing woman who, grateful and exhausted, went directly to her
			alcove.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Well, that oughta do it."</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna?"</p>
		<p>"Captain?"</p>
		<p>"What was that extra bit all about?"</p>
		<p>"What extra bit?" B'Elanna said non-commitally into the com. from
			Engineering.</p>
		<p>"Do you love her?"</p>
		<p>"Hey, Captain?" asked Tom over the com. from the Holodeck control
			room, "did I hear B'Elanna say she loves Seven?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I think we all heard that," offered Harry smiling, standing
			next to his Captain in her Ready Room.  "All we need to hear now is
			that she confirms it.  B'Elanna?"</p>
		<p>"Starfleet?"</p>
		<p>"Miss Torres, would you like to put us out of our misery."</p>
		<p>"Yes, Captain.  I love her."</p>
		<p>"Does she know?" asked Tom in this strange three-way conversation.</p>
		<p>"Well, she does now!"</p>
		<p>"Well good luck, sweetheart," said Kathryn.  "I hope Santa brings you
			just what's on your Christmas list."</p>
		<p>"Me too," added Tom and Harry.</p>
		<p>"Thanks."</p>
		<p>Kathryn broke the comlink between herself, Tom and B'Elanna, and sat
			back in her chair.  "You think she'll be OK?  Seven, I mean."</p>
		<p>Harry looked once more at the viewscreen where Seven could be seen in
			the Cargo Bay, regenerating.  "I think we'll have to wait until
			morning for that one, Captain.  She won't come out of it until then."</p>
		<p>"She looked so upset, Harry."</p>
		<p>"She's stronger than you think, she'll be fine," he reassured,
			understanding that as the Captain had concocted this entire plan she
			felt responsible for the outcome, plus she felt responsible for the
			ex-Borg, period.</p>
		<p>Kathryn smiled at Harry.  "Go get some well-earned sleep, ensign.
			Santa and I will see you tomorrow."  Harry smiled back and nodded
			before he turned and left the Ready Room.</p>
		<p>"Janeway to Paris."</p>
		<p>"Paris here, Captain.  What can I do for you?"</p>
		<p>"How on earth did you manage the weightless bit in space, Tom?  I was
			very impressed."</p>
		<p>"Ah, a good magician never gives away his secrets Captain.  Call it
			Holodeck magic.  It worked well, didn't it?"</p>
		<p>"It certainly did," Kathryn laughed.  "Well done, Tom.  I'll thank
			B'Elanna in the morning, she sounds beat.  `Night, Tom."</p>
		<p>"'Night ma'am.  You did a good thing today."</p>
		<p>"Oh, tomorrow will tell, Mr Paris.  Tomorrow will tell."</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>B'Elanna Torres was especially nervous this morning.  Nervous wasn't
			a state she was used to being in, so she'd managed to drop a few
			things whilst getting ready.  And after she'd managed to drop a few
			things, she'd managed to issue a few Klingon curses in their
			direction as they'd lain oblivious, awaiting retrieval.   </p>
		<p>Somewhat calmed now, and standing in front of the mirror brushing her
			hair, B'Elanna suddenly stopped what she was doing, the brush still
			held against her head.   She stared into the eyes of her mirror image
			for some time and then lowered the brush. "What the hell were you
			thinking?" she asked of herself.  The image looked as confused and
			worried about the possible results of her actions as she did.  "You
			couldn't have just worked up to this?  You had to hit her with it all
			at once?"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna's hair suffered somewhat for the next few moments as it was
			subjected to a vigorous brushing.  However, the Engineer managed to
			pull through the experience and look as neat and tidy as ever, as she
			left her quarters to face the day ahead.  To face Seven.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Computer, what day is this?" </p>
		<p>
			<i>It is Stardate 51756</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Yes, but what day is it," persisted Seven excitedly.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Today is Tuesday</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Yes, but."</p>
		<p>"It's Christmas Day, Seven," said the Captain quietly, as she walked
			up to her officer and leaned against the alcove, looking up at her.</p>
		<p>"Captain, I didn't hear you come in.  Can I do something for you?"</p>
		<p>"I'm here to ask you to the Christmas dinner today, at 13.00 in the
			Mess Hall."  As Seven opened her mouth to reply, Kathryn held up a
			hand to stop her, "Oh, I know you'll say no, but you can't blame me
			for wanting to include you."</p>
		<p>"I wasn't going to say no, I was going to say yes," said Seven with a
			smile, "had I been given the chance to do so."</p>
		<p>Kathryn feigned surprise.  "Well, I'm sorry.  Whatever happened
			to `Christmas is irrelevant'?"</p>
		<p>Looking into a perfectly innocent-looking face Seven answered, "But
			it isn't, Captain.  It is very relevant, however it took a dream last
			night to help me see it." </p>
		<p>"Oh?  Go on."</p>
		<p>Looking suddenly open and vulnerable, Seven murmured, "It was so
			real.  It brought to my attention my need to change."  </p>
		<p>"You only change if you want to, Seven, not because a dream tells you
			so."  </p>
		<p>"Oh, I want to Captain," confirmed Seven, stepping down from her
			alcove and facing Kathryn with a smile,  "And I will see you at 13.00
			hours in the Mess Hall. </p>
		<p>"Sure?"  Kathryn needed to ask, as she was feeling slightly guilty
			about her part in this manipulation, but Seven's nod reassured
			her.  "OK then, 13.00." </p>
		<p>The Captain had nearly reached the Cargo Bay doors when Seven's
			thoughts suddenly caught up with something.  "Captain?" she asked. </p>
		<p>"What is it Seven?"</p>
		<p>"I need access to a replicator.  I have many credits built up, as I
			have rarely used my allotted amount."</p>
		<p>Realising what Seven was about to do, Kathryn agreed and made the
			necessary arrangements.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Icheb was slightly concerned: this wasn't like Seven, at least not
			the Seven he knew.  This one was smiling and laughing and planning to
			go to the Christmas meal in the Mess Hall soon; this one had given
			him a Christmas gift and a kiss on the cheek and harboured a large
			pack of gifts to give out later. And, most disturbingly, this Seven
			spoke affectionately about Lieutenant Torres instead of informing him
			of the latest row they had had.  </p>
		<p>Icheb thought the smile, which was almost constantly present on
			Seven's face, made her look younger and even prettier than before
			and, while he was undoubtedly pleased for her, he couldn't get away
			from the fact - this simply wasn't like Seven.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>"I thought I'd be the last one here, Captain, sorry I'm late."</p>
		<p>"No, that honour goes to the Doctor and Seven," replied Kathryn to
			Harry Kim, who was just lowering himself into a seat, amidst torn
			wrapping paper and numerous gifts strewn about.</p>
		<p>"She's coming then?" Chakotay asked, not trying to hide his
			admiration for the Captain and her `team'.  "Your little plot worked?"</p>
		<p>"Well, we shouldn't count our chickens, Chakotay.  I mean, she's not
			here yet, is she," warned the Captain, "She said she'd be here."
		</p>
		<p>It was now Harry's turn to give a gift out to everyone and receive
			some back to the sounds of "ooohh's" and "aaahh's" registering
			everyone's appreciation, as laughter and friendship ran amok around
			the table.</p>
		<p>Tom leaned across Tuvok (who sat back to allow better access) and
			waved a cracker in Kathryn's direction.  "Come on, Captain, pull this
			cracker with me, huh?  I've got a hankering to see you sat there with
			a crown on your head!" he said cheekily, hoping B'Elanna had
			remembered to include the paper hats.</p>
		<p>"Uh huh.  Well, only if you wear yours too.  Deal?"</p>
		<p>"Deal," agreed Tom as he steadied his hand on the cracker end.</p>
		<p>"Oh, wait a minute," B'Elanna raised a hand and looked at everyone
			around the table.  "Look, I don't want to spoil anyone's fun here
			but - I couldn't figure out the noisy bit, so when you pull these
			things, you're gonna have to shout `bang'.  OK?" </p>
		<p>"OK," grinned Tom as he turned back to the Captain and looked at
			her.  He decided to count her down.  "One," he began.  By the time he
			said "Two" Harry, Chakotay and B'Elanna had joined the countdown.
			By "Three", they had all joined in, and when Tom and Kathryn tugged
			the cracker apart, the resultant "BANG" from the table was deafening,
			drawing smiles from other diners.</p>
		<p>"Definitely more fun that way," said Kathryn to B'Elanna as she
			pushed the thin paper crown on her head, and looked expectantly at
			Tom - a crooked grin on her face, awaiting the expected tirade of
			abuse.</p>
		<p>Tom got up from his seat and bowed deeply before her.  "Your
			majesty," he said in an affected voice which had Kathryn and the
			others jeering in fun at him.</p>
		<p>"So, who's going to pull mine?" asked Harry suggestively.</p>
		<p>"I thought you'd never ask!" grinned Chakotay as the countdown began
			again.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>".and I do not wish to make an entrance alone.  Doctor, will you
			assist me?"</p>
		<p>"Of course, Seven.  You know I'm always happy to help you develop
			your social skills, but you know we're going to be late if we don't
			hurry."  The Doctor paused and looked at Seven with a mixture of
			puzzlement and a smile, plus a slight frown. "What made you change
			your mind?"</p>
		<p>"A dream, Doctor."</p>
		<p>The Doctor would have questioned further but Seven had swept up her
			rather large package and was heading towards the door.  "We should
			hurry," she urged breezily.  Following her out of sickbay the Doctor
			considered that whatever had happened to her, he like it and hoped it
			would last.</p>

		<hr></hr>
		<p>Neelix stood before the noisiest table in the Mess Hall and lowered
			the first bowl of soup from his tray to the waiting diners.  Sam
			Wildman joined him and soon everyone at the Command Table (as it had
			now become dubbed) was served, Naomi bringing up the rear with a
			basket full of bread rolls.</p>
		<p>With his back to the door, Neelix was enquiring after the table's
			empty spaces when the door opened and in walked the Doctor and
			Seven.  B'Elanna's eyes met Seven's, silently guiding her over to the
			vacant seat beside her. Seven held her gaze as she approached and
			took the seat, noticing with satisfaction that the Engineer looked
			interestingly flustered. Neelix acknowledged the latecomers and
			scurried back to the counter for more soup, which he returned with
			immediately.</p>
		<p>"I apologise to you all for my lateness," a smiling Seven said to the
			rest of the table.  "And the Doctor is late because I made him so!"</p>
		<p>"No problem, Seven," said Chakotay.  "You're both here now.  Here."
			he put a cracker Seven's way, "It's a tradition, you."</p>
		<p>"I am aware, Commander; I researched the subject of Christmas and its
			traditions this morning.  I am happy to comply," she said, taking
			hold of the cracker end.  When the countdown began, she raised an
			eyebrow and smiled a question around at the others.</p>
		<p>"On three, Seven," Harry offered hastily as the count reached two.  </p>
		<p>"Three!"  Seven and Chakotay pulled hard on the cracker.  "BANG"
			yelled everyone at the table to Seven's obvious delight, as her
			laughter mingled with theirs and her smiling face looked around them
			all before she returned her attention to her soup, and the woman
			beside her. </p>
		<p>The others at the table had quietened somewhat as they began eating,
			although a more private chatter had started up.  </p>
		<p>"You came, then?"  It was an unnecessary question as Seven's presence
			was proof enough, but B'Elanna needed to say it.</p>
		<p>"You thought I would not!" Seven smiled, resting her spoon over the
			soup dish and awaiting a reply.
		</p>
		<p>"No!  I - uh.  Yeah. I thought you wouldn't come.  You look
			different, somehow," said B'Elanna, knowing fully what had brought
			about the change in her. One day soon, she would have to come clean,
			but not yet.  Not today.</p>
		<p>Throughout the progression of the meal, every now and again a person-
			in-the-know would glance in B'Elanna's and Seven's direction, to see
			how they were getting on.  The general conversation around the table
			was easy, friendly and fun loving - these people gelling with each
			other in an extraordinary way, no doubt borne of the fact that they
			were in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
		<p>Neelix and his team excelled themselves and picked up endless
			congratulations from around the room.  Soon, the sated diners were
			sitting back in their seats drinking the last of the coffee and
			enjoying the feeling of unity and relaxation that had grown between
			them all.</p>
		<p>During a lull in the gentle conversation, Seven reached down for the
			bag at her feet, brushing B'Elanna's thigh with her arm as she did
			so, sending an electric shock apiece through both women, which was
			acknowledged by their quick look at each other.  Recovering quickly,
			Seven raised her voice and addressed the occupants of the table.  "I
			have some gifts here for you.  Please, I would like to distribute
			them."</p>
		<p>The others stopped talking and looked towards Seven, as she reached
			in the bag and pulled out the first gift that fell to hand.  Seven
			passed it to Tom who ripped it open while everyone watched,
			fascinated. </p>
		<p>"A set of spanners, Seven.  Thank you.  That's really cool."</p>
		<p>"Not just any spanners, Mr Paris," said Seven, to everyone's obvious
			amusement.  "These are special spanners designed for ve-hicles.  I
			think you will find them a perfect fit for that ancient Earth
			automobile you are - I think the expression is - `doing up'!" </p>
		<p>As Tom stared his amazement at the group, they were all verbally
			applauding a smiling Seven's choice.</p>
		<p>The next gift to hand was for Chakotay and Seven passed it towards
			him.  The Commander tore at the paper eagerly to reveal a medium-
			sized framed print of an eagle in flight.  "I did some research,
			Commander," Seven explained.  "This bird featured heavily in the
			customs of your people."</p>
		<p>"A handsome gift, Seven.  Thank you," said a surprised Chakotay to a
			(by now) slightly blushing Seven, who reached into the bag once more
			and pulled out an envelope, which she handed nervously to B'Elanna.</p>
		<p>"Thanks."  The slightly self-conscious Engineer found it hard to
			control her interest as she looked to see what the envelope
			contained.  "A token," she told everyone, "for four hours Holodeck
			time."  She stared at Seven incredulously, "You're giving me this?"
			she asked.</p>
		<p>"I am," replied Seven.  "Of course, if you require any help in using
			it, I shall be more than happy to accompany you," Seven added boldly,
			watching with interest the pink tinge that was spreading unchecked
			through B'Elanna's cheeks.</p>
		<p>There were some seated at the table who had not been surprised by
			Seven's remark, although they tried to look that way as she glanced
			around everyone.  Reaching into her bag again she pulled out a thin
			and flat gift, which she handed to Harry.  The young ensign opened it
			to reveal many sheets of blank music score paper - a rare thing to a
			person with limited replicator rations.  He thanked her warmly.</p>
		<p>The Doctor received a golf ball with `Everyone a Winner' printed on
			it; Tuvok actually smiled as he shook out a purple and gold silk
			square, for the express purpose, Seven informed him, of sitting upon
			while he meditated, and Neelix received a blank book to write his own
			recipes in.</p>
		<p>That left only one person without a gift.  Seven's eyes met the
			Captain's and found an expression of great pride and encouragement
			flowing towards her from the older woman.</p>
		<p>Reaching into the bag for the last time, Seven pulled out a small
			box.  She handed it to the Captain, who opened it to reveal a folded
			letter.  Swiftly Seven reached across to her, stretching out a
			hand, "May I read it to you, Captain?" she asked.  Confused, Kathryn
			handed the letter to her.</p>
		<p>Seven unfolded the letter and looked around at the others before she
			started reading.  "Captain Janeway, there is no gift I could
			replicate for you that would in any way equal the gift you gave to me
			when you severed me from the Collective.  You gave me my life, gave
			me a place to belong and, most importantly, reinstated my free will.</p>
		<p>"My gift to you is my heartfelt gratitude, which will have to be
			conveyed by these two simple words, `thank you'.  Signed: Annika
			Hansen."</p>
		<p>Everyone had fallen silent at the impact Seven's words had made.  The
			Captain stared at Seven, tears welling up in her eyes.  "Oh Seven,
			that is without doubt the best gift I could have received," she said
			as she reached out for the letter Seven handed to her. </p>
		<p>"Christmas is about new birth, is it not?" continued Seven, her eyes
			twinkling as she looked around the table. "I wish to announce that,
			as of this moment, I wish to be known as Annika Hansen," she paused
			to gauge the reaction of those gathered - finding it favourable she
			added,  "And I wish you all a very Happy Christmas!"</p>
		<p>A chorus of "Happy Christmas" and congratulations greeted the ex-
			drone as she attended to the final, most important thing on
			her `list' of things to do.  Carefully and deliberately she reached
			across to B'Elanna's lap and wrapped her hand around the smaller
			woman's hand.  Above the din, she heard B'Elanna sigh. </p>
		<p>Moving closer, Annika asked, "Would you care to use some of that
			Holodeck time this evening, Miss Torres?"</p>
		<p>Suddenly playful, B'Elanna replied, "And what if I don't?"</p>
		<p>"Then I shall have to come home with you instead."</p>
		<p>"Now that's made it hard to decide!" B'Elanna said, smiling nervously
			at Seven.  Then she turned fully towards Seven, and looked up at her
			hair with a thoughtful expression.  "You know," she said, "I'm
			sitting here staring at Seven's hair. Pardon me, but it's hard for me
			to think of you as Annika when I'm staring at Seven's hair."</p>
		<p>By now, some of the other crewmembers had caught on to the
			conversation between the two women and were watching to see what
			would happen next.</p>
		<p>"So what do you suggest?"</p>
		<p>"This," breathed B'Elanna, as she reached up and pulled the pins from
			the austere style on the younger woman's head.  Slowly, almost
			seductively, she pushed her fingers up through
			the blonde hair and pulled it down around her shoulders.  "Hello,
			Annika," she said at last, with her hands still resting around the
			blonde's neck.</p>
		<p>"Hello B'Elanna," replied Annika, now commanding everyone's attention
			as she allowed the smiling engineer to pull her close for a gentle
			kiss.</p>
		<p>It was up to the Captain to break the silence as she said to the two
			women, "It looks as though Santa has brought you two all you will
			ever need." </p>
		<p>"Come on, Annika, we have gifts for you here," said Chakotay as the
			others nodded and gave the gifts they had brought, just in the vague
			hope that she would attend.  Mildly embarrassed, but holding on well,
			Annika unwrapped each in turn and gave her thanks, surprised that
			anyone should want to give her a gift, after the way she had treated
			them.</p>
		<p>Chakotay's gift of a full blue-topped Officer of Science uniform
			touched her the most.  When she had joined everyone this lunchtime,
			she had looked around the room wishing she could feel more fully a
			part of these people, more like one of them.  Chakotay's insight
			surprised her.</p>
		<p>"We'll work out a rank for you later," he told an overcome Seven, who
			looked from Chakotay to the Captain, to Tuvok and back to Chakotay.
			They were all in agreement that this was a uniform she should wear.</p>
		<p>"I don't know what to say," she started.</p>
		<p>"Well, as long as your ranking is less than a Commander, you can say
			thank you," he replied, eyes twinkling.  "If it's any higher, I'm out
			of here - give me a shuttle - please, I couldn't stand it," he said
			in an overdone voice.</p>
		<p>Amid the resultant laughter the Captain got up from the table and
			walked over to Neelix, put an arm around his neck and
			whispered `thank you' to him.  She then addressed the entire room,
			wishing, "Merry Christmas everyone!" to all present, which resulted
			in numerous noisy replies.</p>
		<p>"And a happy New Year," breathed B'Elanna into Annika's ear.  "I
			shall make sure of it."  </p>
		<p>As the two women rested their foreheads together Annika Hansen
			silently thanked the three spectres who had opened her eyes to the
			true meaning of Christmas - to begin again, from wherever you have
			found yourself, and decide to be the best that you can be, now and
			always. And to let love into your life.</p>
		<p>"My quarters," whispered B'Elanna, finally deciding between the
			quarters and the Holodeck,  "and I'll show you what else Santa's got
			for you!"</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna, Santa could not give me any more than I have already."</p>
		<p>"You wanna bet?"</p>
