<!-- Forgive if Not Forget \ Part 1 -->

<p>Buffy walked into the dorm room she shared with Willow and headed straight for her bed. Once reaching her intended position she promptly flopped down and let her limbs fling where they wanted to and took up intently staring at the ceiling. Her life was falling apart; her life was reaching new and magnificent heights. Her life was treading into uncharted territories; she was falling in love. She had fallen in love; she couldn't fall in love. She didn't know what the hell was going on inside of her head or her heart and it was not so slowly driving her insane.</p>

<p>Closing her eyes she took a deep breath and decided that the only way she was going to figure out what was going on with her was if she sat-or in this case lay down-and thought long and hard about what had been going on in her life over the past month. And she knew exactly where to start her recollection, and who to start it with. All things considered, it all came down to Faith.</p>

<p>{Faith was sitting on top of her, only it wasn't Faith, it was her. Faith was in her body sitting on top of her punching her about the face. But that wasn't really it, Faith wasn't really punching her-Buffy-she was punching, yelling at and cursing at herself. Buffy, unfortunately for her, just happened to be occupying the battered body for the moment.</p>

<p>Then it stopped, the fury, the raging, and the anguish…it froze. As their minds, their consciousness, or whatever you would like to call where transferred back into their bodies, time seemed to stand still for a moment. Both of them trapped in a form of stasis. Then Buffy looked down into Faith's brown eyes. Shocked, lost, hurt, scared brown eyes. And then she was being shoved away, the body beneath hers bucking up and thrusting her off in a violent motion. And then Faith was standing, and turning, and running away.</p>

<p>Buffy sat there for a moment, stunned, confused, then she too stood up.</p>

<p>"Faith!" she called out, her own voice sounding strange to her ears after having inhabited the other Slayer's body. "Faith!" she called again when the Slayer didn't stop. There was a brief hesitation in her exit, but she didn't stop.</p>

<p>Once again Buffy paused for a moment; she was torn. Torn between what her heart was telling her to do and what her head was telling her was best. Should she chase after her brunette counter part as her heart so passionately willed her to do? Or should she let her go, let her run out of her life, out of Sunnydale, into oblivion? There was really no decision to be made. Buffy headed after her.</p>

<p>Faith had a good head start on her, but through pure will Buffy managed to keep her in sight. The distance between them closed and gained over the course of the chase, but Buffy never lost sight of the girl. The game of cat and mouse went on for a considerable amount of time, a half-hour Buffy would have guessed if she had been asked. Through the town, over park benches, through the woods, into alleys, they ran. Then finally, after passing through a thicket of woods Buffy observed the girl in front of her came to a halt.</p>

<p>Cautiously approaching the other girl Buffy craned her neck to try and observe what could have caused this sudden change of events. She found it. Faith was standing on the edge of a cliff. How far the fall was below Buffy couldn't tell, but if it was enough to stop Faith she knew it had to be considerable.</p>

<p>"Alright, B" Faith said turning around, her voice full of bravado. "Let's have at it."</p>

<p>Buffy didn't move.</p>

<p>"No," the blonde Slayer responded softly.</p>

<p>"That wasn't a question, B," Faith said bouncing on her heels lightly. "It was a warning. Whether you want to heed or not serious hurt is coming your way," the brunette went on.</p>

<p>"I don't want to fight you," Buffy responded in the same tone she had used before.</p>

<p>"Little late to play Mother fucking Teresa," Faith responded. "You can't just gut someone and then expect to be all hands across America," she went on approaching Buffy.</p>

<p>"I won't fight you," Buffy responded. "Not again," Buffy went on. "Like you said…I've done enough damage already," she said finishing as Faith reached her.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," Faith responded raising her hand.</p>

<p>Buffy closed her eyes and waited. And waited…and waited.</p>

<p>Faith's hand twitched as she held it back, ready to strike. It would be so easy. Buffy wasn't even looking. She could take her out; she could take her out so easily. All she had to do was move. All she had to do was hit her. All she had to do was grow a fucking a spine because her fist just wouldn't move.</p>

<p>"Fuck B!" Faith swore twirling around angrily. "That's fucking low! Open your goddamn eyes!"</p>

<p>"If I do that you'll hit me," Buffy responded keeping her eyes firmly shut.</p>

<p>"That's the plan," Faith growled.</p>

<p>"Then I'm not going to open them," Buffy stated firmly. "I don't want to fight you," Buffy paused. "I also have no desire to be pummeled to death," she added.</p>

<p>"What the hell is this?" Faith asked in an exasperated tone. "You chase me out here like a fucking cougar so that you can what? Nag me to death? Fucking hand me over to the police and get your honorary deputy's badge?" she went on. "I'm outta here," she said starting to move around Buffy.</p>

<p>"No!" the blonde Slayer exclaimed reaching out her hand on instinct and grabbing onto the darker Slayers arm.</p>

<p>"If you don't let go of me, I don't care if you shut your eyes and plug your ears, I will kick your ass," Faith ground out with barely controlled anger. Why the fuck couldn't Buffy just leave her alone to crawl off somewhere and die? Did she take some sort of perverse joy in torturing her, because god knew she couldn't be doing what she was doing because she gave a damn about her. There was an angle Faith was missing. She knew it.</p>

<p>"I'll take that chance," Buffy responded softly. "Because I can't let you go."</p>

<p>"Can't B? I don't fucking think so. Won't is more like it," Faith responded trying to tug her arm free. "Say sionora," Faith went on raising her hand. This time she wasn't going to fucking chicken out. She didn't care if every cell in her body was telling her to just listen to Buffy. She didn't care if in her heart she wanted to listen to Buffy, wanted to trust Buffy. All the cared about the inevitable fact that she was going to get screwed over and she just wasn't fucking up to that at the moment. Her flying shit deflector was temporarily malfunctioning so she was going to have to duck out of the way.</p>

<p>"Please Faith," Buffy said with a pleading edge in her voice. "Let me help you."</p>

<p>"Help me?" Faith asked incredulously. "Help me? What the fuck do you think you could do to help me? Shoot me this time?" she went on, her voice involuntarily exhibiting the pain the topic brought her.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment, the remark hitting its target with a stinging accuracy.</p>

<p>"I thought that I'd maybe start with a hug," Buffy responded softly. She had meant the remark to come out with a trace of humor but as it was she sounded deathly serious, and, she realized, she was.</p>

<p>"A hug?" Faith asked, this time her voice more bewildered than angry. At least for the moment. "You want to hug me?"</p>

<p>"I…yes, yes I do," Buffy said finally opening her eyes and turning to face Faith.</p>

<p>"What the fuck are you up to?" Faith asked suspiciously renewing her struggles. "You're just trying to mess with my head. Make it easier to screw me over," she went on.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy said not releasing Faith from their gaze. "I just want to help you. Starting with a hug. No screwing or fucking, or any other verb that you want to toss out. Just the truth, and nothing but the truth…so help me god," Buffy went on holding her hand up as if swearing a solemn oath.</p>

<p>"You don't give a flying fuck about me," Faith said in what was intended to be a harsh whisper, but came out more a heart broken accusation.</p>

<p>"I give many flying fucks about you," Buffy responded a smile slowly making its way across her face. "And I know that I've done a lousy job of showing it and of that I am deeply ashamed," she went on. "You also have to admit that you didn't exactly make it easy for me what with all…" Buffy searched for a delicate term, "with all of your extracurricular activities," she said finally settling on a word. "But here now, I'm standing in front of…well beside you, holding a white flag. I haven't really given the how, or even the why much thought, but I know that I want to help you…and I know that somewhere inside of you you want to accept it. Please, listen to the white guy on your shoulder," Buffy finished in a pleading voice.</p>

<p>"Wha…" Faith started to say and Buffy could see tears beginning to form in her eyes. "What do you want from me?" she asked turning away from Buffy. She'd be damned if she were going to let Blondie see her cry.</p>

<p>"Just you," Buffy responded truthfully.</p>

<p>"I can't undo it!" Faith exclaimed whipping her head back around to face Buffy.</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy said. "I'm not asking you to."</p>

<p>"Then what are you asking me to do?" Faith asked not quite able to hold back the tears.</p>

<p>"Forgive," Buffy responded wanting nothing more than to wipe the tears from</p>

<p>Faith's face, but reframed knowing that it wasn't quite time yet.</p>

<p>"Who? You?" Faith asked ready to yank her arm away again.</p>

<p>"No," Buffy responded gently. "You."</p>

<p>"Forgive me?" Faith asked her a vile half laugh, half sob erupting from her throat. "And how the fuck am I suppose to do that? I'm a goddamn murdering, fucked up, pathetic piece of white trash that's never touched something without fucking it up! And I'm suppose to forgive myself?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy responded reaching out this time with her other hand to place it on Faith's cheek.</p>

<p>"How?" Faith asked losing her internal battle and succumbing to the tenderness Buffy was offering. "How?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Buffy said shaking her head. And she didn't. She didn't even know what she was doing out there, or why she should care about what happened to Faith, how she could care after all that had happened between them and all that they had done to each other. But she did care. And she knew that. It was as inexorable a fact as that she was Buffy Summers. "But we will…I promise. Together," she said meeting Faith's eyes once again.</p>

<p>In those soulful brown orbs she saw a flicker of resistance, of fear, of doubt. And then she witnessed the breaking of whatever barrier Faith still had walled up inside of her, and the next thing she knew the brunette was in her arms, sobs racking her body. And as Buffy wrapped her arms more tightly around Faith she felt the burning of tears in her own eyes. She let them fall. If whatever they had embarked upon was going to work, it had to be an equal partnership.}</p>

<p>Buffy blinked the ceiling of the dorm coming into view once again. As with the memory she had just left she could feel tears burning her eyes. Being wrapped up with Faith, crying her eyes out in the middle of the forest that day had been one of the most powerful events of her life. It had been beautiful and terrifying. Freeing, and enveloping. It had been almost painfully tender, and starkly intimate. She had no words, no thoughts that could accurately describe the span of emotions she had felt that day. The depth of emotion that lay there. It had been breathtaking, and it had only been the beginning on a road that was bound to get bumpier.</p>

<p>{Somehow they had fallen to the ground after wrapping themselves together, and sometime after that had fallen asleep. Or at least Buffy had, for she distinctly remembered waking up. Her back hurt like a bitch and her leg was asleep, and the moment the cobwebs cleared she realized that she was alone. When this realization hit her panic set in and she quickly sat up fully intending to look around for Faith.</p>

<p>"Somebody needs to switch to decaf," came the dry observation from somewhere off to her side. Buffy turned to face the voice, her anxiety lessening even before she spotted Faith's form sitting a meter to her left. "Good morning, or afternoon, or evening…or whenever the fuck it is. Someone at the hospital stole my goddamn watch you know," Faith continued watching as Buffy woke up.</p>

<p>Buffy reached for hers and started to take it off.</p>

<p>"I don't want your watch B," Faith responded staring hard at the other Slayer. "'Sides, I've been meaning to learn all that time of day by position of the sun shit. No time like the present you know."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd taken off," Buffy said crossing her legs after turning to face Faith. They were both now sitting Indian style.</p>

<p>"Thought about it," Faith admitted. "Could've too, you sleep the dead B," she went on. "Someone'd have to whack you upside the head to wake you up."</p>

<p>"Did you think about that too?" Buffy asked, but her tone was light.</p>

<p>Faith just smirked.</p>

<p>"What changed your mind? About leaving I mean," Buffy asked a moment later.</p>

<p>Faith shrugged. "I guess maybe I'm a masochist, but I was thinking maybe you were telling the truth," she said finally. "And I'm tired of running," she added in a smaller voice.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you stayed," Buffy replied honesty.</p>

<p>"Are you really?" Faith asked. "I'm thinking I'm gonna be causing you a lot more pain than pleasure," she went on. "I don't think the Super Friends are gonna be too thrilled to hear Hannibal's still around."</p>

<p>"You're probably right," Buffy responded again in all honesty. "This is going to take some work…on all our parts."</p>

<p>"So?" Faith asked tossing her hands up in the air. "What now?"</p>

<p>"We talk," Buffy responded simply.</p>

<p>"About what?" Faith asked not really liking the sound of the talking idea.</p>

<p>"I'd say we have a variety of subjects to chose from," Buffy responded dropping her head down to look at her lap.</p>

<p>They were silent for long moments.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I stabbed you," Buffy said in a rush breaking the silence.</p>

<p>Faith was quiet for a moment then she started to laugh. Buffy looked over at her sharply.</p>

<p>"That's amusing?" the blonde haired Slayer asked.</p>

<p>"Not it's just…real subtle B," Faith said by way of explanation. "That was jam packed full of finesse."</p>

<p>"I don't think this conver is going to be all artful and graceful like a swan," Buffy responded shrugging. "Ugly topics to cover here."</p>

<p>Faith nodded her head once but didn't respond verbally. Again the silence came.</p>

<p>"Are you really sorry?" Faith asked looking up. "Are you? Or are you just saying that cause it's the polite thing to do?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked up meeting her eyes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry. I never wanted things to escalate to that point. I never wanted it to come to that…" Faith interrupted.</p>

<p>"Come on B, you may not have wanted to sishkabob me, but you sure as hell didn't come over to sing camp songs and make smoores. You wanted to feed me to un-dead boy," Faith interjected.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed.</p>

<p>"Ugly issues, ugly truths," Faith commented. She wasn't sure if the comment was directed more at herself or at Buffy.</p>

<p>"Okay," Buffy said sighing deeply. "I didn't go to you with the most honorable of intentions, I went because I thought it was the only thing I could do. And I wasn't lying, I never wanted it to come to that, I never wanted to fight you in a 'do or die' match, but…" Buffy trailed off.</p>

<p>"When the choice was between me and the brooding one there really wasn't a choice," Faith supplied in the silence.</p>

<p>"It's not that simple," Buffy responded looking up at Faith.</p>

<p>"It never is B," Faith shot back. "But in the crunch, that's when we find out what's really inside."</p>

<p>Buffy lanced Faith with a harsh gaze and opened her mouth as if to respond, but then promptly shut it. She wasn't going to have this turn into a grudge match, but it was too late. Faith could tell from that one look exactly what Buffy was thinking.</p>

<p>"Say it," Faith demanded. "Go on! Say it!"</p>

<p>"No," Buffy responded refusing to meet the other girls gaze.</p>

<p>"Say it B! In the crunch I turned into a murdering psychotic!" Faith exclaimed angrily. The funny thing-in a sad way-was that she wasn't even mad at Buffy, she was mad at herself. She was disgusted with herself because it was true. She just sunk into the lowest rung possible and sulked there. Fuck everyone, screw 'em all!</p>

<p>"Your step faltered," Buffy responded finally. "And you had no one to pick you back up. More accurately I wasn't there to pick you back up," Buffy continued.</p>

<p>"And left to my own devices I started murdering people," Faith responded.</p>

<p>"Demons," Buffy replied. "You killed mostly demons."</p>

<p>"You know what they say B, it's the thought that counts," Faith retorted.</p>

<p>"Playing the blame game isn't going to get us anywhere," Buffy said blowing out a frustrated breath. "We both fucked up," she continued. "And I think we both know it. I also think we've both been beating ourselves up over it for long enough."</p>

<p>Faith stood up. "You're right. I'm sorry B. I'm sorry I fucked you and your friends and even fang boy. But I can't just 'I'm sorry' my way out of this cause I screwed my way into criminal charges and unless I get the fuck outta here I'm going to spend the rest of life in a cage and I'm not about to let that happen," she said pacing the area.</p>

<p>"Don't go," Buffy said standing as well.</p>

<p>"I have to," Faith said still not moving from her pacing path. "This isn't about forgiveness. I forgive you for whatever it is you've convinced yourself you did to me, and for what I convinced myself you did to me too. This is about my life and losing it. I'll admit I did some fucked up shit, but if I'm locked away I'm as good as dead B," Faith went on. "You've gotta understand that."</p>

<p>"I do," Buffy admitted. "But I also understand that I can't be alone right now, and I you can't either."</p>

<p>"You've got Kool and the Gang," Faith responded.</p>

<p>"And you?" Buffy responded. "You've got me."</p>

<p>"No, I've got an APB out on me, and I've got to go!" Faith said finally determined to actually move. She'd been side tracked enough by all of this emotional shit.</p>

<p>"Stay here, and we'll deal with that," Buffy said reaching out to stop her.</p>

<p>"How?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>Buffy was silent for a moment, then her eyes lit up and the proverbial light bulb appeared over her head.</p>

<p>"Willow," Buffy breathed out.</p>

<p>"Willow?" Faith asked looking at Buffy like she was a madwoman. "Newflash, Willow hates me. Deeply hates me," she went on.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen that Sandra Bullock movie about the computers?" Buffy asked not even hearing Faith's response.</p>

<p>"Hello? Did you not hear what I said?" Faith asked. "And yes I saw 'The Net'. Why?"</p>

<p>"Willow could do her computer thing and do what they did to her in the movie only it would be good in your case," Buffy responded looking over at Faith.</p>

<p>"The police know what I look like," Faith pointed out.</p>

<p>"No they have a general description, which excepting the superhero qualities could fit a thousand girls. Brown hair, brown eyes, and leather doesn't really make for a conclusive identification," Buffy retorted.</p>

<p>"Fine, your still missing one key factor," Faith said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Willow hates my fucking guts. What makes you think that she's going to give a shit what happens to me? Or that she's going to want to help me?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Faith with gentle eyes.</p>

<p>"You really don't know Willow do you?" she asked almost in wonderment. "She'll help because we're going to ask her to. We're going to ask her extremely nicely, and she'll do it because it's the right thing to do. And as much as she dislikes you, she wouldn't do anything to purposefully cause harm to another human being. That's why," Buffy responded.</p>

<p>Faith was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"If she says no…I'm gone," Faith said finally. "I mean it, I'm outta here if she says no."</p>

<p>"Deal," Buffy said. She knew Willow as well as she knew herself, and she knew that once they talked Willow would help.</p>

<p>"You trust her that much?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy responded smiling.</p>

<p>Faith shook her head in wonderment. Whatever.</p>

<p>"Fine, let's get with the going then," Faith said heading off into the woods.}</p>
