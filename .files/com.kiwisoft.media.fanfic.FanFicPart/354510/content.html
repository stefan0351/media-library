<!-- Legend \ Chapter 17: Wrath of the Bladesinger -->

<p>Cordelia sat down on Angel's lap and wrapped her arms around her newfound
love. The concern she had for Angel rapidly increased as Buffy’s words from
last night ran through her mind, (Vlad has went to far first he almost takes
Willow from me, then he hurts her by murdering her father, and now this.
The time has come to end it.) Cordelia tilted her head towards Angel and
pressed her lips softly against his.</p>

<p>Angel smiled at Cordelia and inquired about the unexpected kiss, "Not that I
mind but what was that for?"</p>

<p>"For good luck."</p>

<p>Angel grinned and then pulled her closer to him, "I think I am going to need
all the luck I can get."</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled at Angel as she leaned in for another kiss, "I think that
can be arranged."</p>

<p>After Buffy had finished her morning exercises she walked over to her and
Willows bed. She bent over her sleeping lover and woke up the redhead by
delicately. She smiled at Willow as she ran her hand accrosed her beloved
forehead, "Time to get up sleepy head."</p>

<p>"Do I have to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everyone else is most likely already up by now, and we should go over
what we need to do tonight."</p>

<p>"Can’t I lay her a little longer," replied Willow, who did not want to get
out of bed quite yet.</p>

<p>"Only if you an give me a good reason why"</p>

<p>Willow sat up in bed and put her hand on the back of Buffy’s head then
pulled her into a passionate kiss.</p>

<p>After the kiss broke Buffy slid up next to Willow and wrapped her arms
around her beloved, "I think another hour or so of waiting won’t kill them,"
she replied before she returned Willow’s kiss.</p>

<p>Eamonn sat accrosed the table looking at Giles, "You know that my time here
is coming to an end. The Bladesinger wishes to face the master vampyre and
make him pay for the pain that he has caused her and her champion."</p>

<p>Giles voice was filled with worry for his two surrogate daughters as he
spoke to the druid high priest, "Are they ready to face him?"</p>

<p>"Both the Bladesinger and her Champions skills are complete, I believe Vlad
Tepes will be in for quite a surprise when he faces them."</p>

<p>"That’s good but I still have one concern about them facing the master
vampyre. I have always told Buffy that she should always go into battle
with a clear head and I think her motivation to face him takes that away
from her."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"She seems caught up in making Vlad pay for what he did to Willow, the fact
that he is the master vampyre or that he was strong enough to open then
close the Hellsmouth appear to be of no concern to her. I am afraid she
might rush in their with nothing but vengeance on her mind and Vlad Tepes
might be able to use that to his advantage."</p>

<p>Eamonn sat back in his chair and smiled, "You are going to make them a very
good advisor. Your concern for them is strong and your advise is sound.
However you still have much to learn about the Bladesinger, but that will
have to wait till you accompany me to the forever. For now I will do what I
can to put your mind at ease. Yes Vlad Tepes opened the Hellsmouth and
closed it, but they destroyed everything that came from it and then sealed
it for all time. It is revenge that the Bladesinger seeks. In her mind it
was Vlad Tepes not the awakening that caused her to be separated from her
champion, and it was Vlad Tepes who made her beloved hurt by killing the
girls father. She is aware of what he did with the Hellsmouth but to her
that was just another way that he endangered her beloved. So while it might
be vengeance that drives her to face him, it is her love for her champion
that fuels that vengeance. It is the same love that enabled the two of them
to seal the Hellsmouth, and that love that will help her destroy the master
Vampyre."</p>

<p>"I think I'm begining to understand, but I have another question. How will
their love for one another aid in the master vampyre’s destruction?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen the power that can be called upon when someone is trying
to protect or avenge those who they care the most about?"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Then imagine what the Bladesinger, the chosen warrior of the Goddess
herself, is capable of doing when she feels that someone has harmed her
soulmate."</p>

<p>As Giles sat back in his chair and pondered the words of the druid and
smiled as he began to realize what Eamonn was saying. Vlad Tepes would soon
meet his match, instead of facing a Slayer and a witch he was going to face
a infuriated Bladesinger and her Champion.</p>

<p>Over a hundred vampires stood in the main chamber of the master vampyres
lair awaiting for the sun to go down. Looking at the army he had created
Vlad knew that the time had come to destroy the Witch and her slayer. The
master vampyre turned to his prodigy and spoke, "The demons have had an
entire night to complete their task, the time for my revenge has come,
Those two girls will not see another sunrise."</p>

<p>An evil smirk came accrosed Spikes face, "And neither will her precious
friends, Master."</p>

<p>"Yes, soon they all will be dead then the new order can begin."</p>

<p>As the sun began to give way to the night Buffy and Willow marched hand in
hand towards the campus. behind them where Angel, Eamonn, and Giles all of
them armed with broad swords and stakes. Xander and Archer were next, both
men carried super soakers loaded with holy water and wore swords at their
side. The two slayers in training brought up the rear wielding crossbows
and carrying an assortment of stakes and arrows.</p>

<p>The secret door that lead to the master vampyre’s lair was thrust open as
Vlad and his children stormed into the night. There was going to be no
mayhem or feeding tonight, for they marched through the darkness with one
purpose, to destroy the witch and the slayer.</p>

<p>Back at the warehouse they sat in silence, their hearts agonized over their
friends and family who were now out there with the master vampyre and his
dark forces. They knew that their was really nothing they could do now but
appeal to the Goddess in their behalf and hope that she would return safely
return them. So they said their prayers to her and waited, each of them lost
in a sea of despair.</p>

<p>The two groups stood there facing one another just outside the Sunnydale
campus, each one waiting for the other to make the first move. Buffy slowly
pulled her sword from its sheath and raised it above her head. The melody
of the bladesong played louder than it ever did as it pierced through the
darkness. As the vampires felt the haunting ballad of the bladesong and
began to back away from the patrol, Willows hands began to radiate a bright
blue light as she focused her energies on the ballad she and Buffy shared.</p>

<p>Vlad stepped forward, rage filled his eyes as he pointed towards Buffy and
screamed out in fury, "She is only a girl, I command you to attack!"</p>

<p>The vampires stopped their slow retreat as soon as their master had spoken.
The bladesong gave them no desire to get close to the Slayer and her friends
but their will was not their own and they were compelled to obey their
master, so they did the last thing they wanted to do and charged their foe.</p>

<p>As the vampires charged them Tristin and Kathryn both fired their crossbows
into the incoming flood of vampires as Xander and Archer opened up with
their super soakers. Two vampires explode into dust as the slayers in
training's stakes pierced their hearts and another three fell to the grown
screaming before they were reduced to ashes by the holy water from the super
soakers.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Angel and Giles, "Stay here and don’t let any of them get to
Willow." She then charged the advancing force with her bladesong proceeding
out before her striking terror into the hearts of the vampires.</p>

<p>Willow raised her right hand to the sky as Buffy charged the undead army
and a large ball of fire appeared above her, she then moved her hand
towards the vampires sending the ball of fire smashing into their ranks. As
it hit twenty of the vampires fell to the ground, their bodies were ravished
by fire for a few seconds before turning them to dust. Eamonn then waved
his hand through the air and ten of the vampires turned to dust.</p>

<p>Buffy gracefully swung her sword through the air decapitating two vampires
and almost slicing another one in half, leaving him screaming on the
ground. She then came around with her sword and ran it through two vampires
dropping both of them to their knees. Buffy then spun in a full circle as
wildly swinging her blade, taking the heads off of four more vampires.</p>

<p>As Buffy fought Willow focused all of her power on her beloved sending up an
invisible energy shield around the Bladesinger. Eamonn looked back at the
two slayers in training, who had just fired another round of stakes towards
the vampiric army, "Reload but don’t fire. The champion is protecting the
Bladesinger, you must not allow any of Vlad’s forces to get to her." He
then turned back towards the vampires and sent a bolt of lighting down that
vaporized two of them.</p>

<p>Spike hit Angel accrosed the chin sending him stumbling back a few steps
before he regained his balance. He then kicked at Angel with a round house
but his sire blocked it. Angel then opened up with a series of jabs that
Spike managed to block. The blonde vamp then came back with a right hook
that was blocked by Angel who got in a solid blow to the abdomen. As Spike
bent over, Angel hit him with both fist accrosed the back of the head
knocking the blonde vampire to the ground. Spike quickly rolled over and
sprung to his feet, only to get hit in the chin by a solid jab.</p>

<p>After Giles staked the vamp he had knocked to the ground he felt a strong
blow hit him accrosed the jaw. The watcher fell to the ground and rolled
backwards away from the vampire who had struck him. The vamp went to leap
on top the watcher before he could get back only to be turned into dust in
mid air by Eamonn. The Druid High priest looked at him, "Get behind me and
guard the champion with the slayers in training, I will do my best to see
that it does not become necessary to for you to fight."</p>

<p>Buffy had cut through the core of the vampires and stood face to face with
Vlad Tepes. He could feel her cold stare pierce through him as her
bladesong evaded his mind momentarily causing him to lose his concentration.
Buffy swung straight for his head as her blade howled through the night
air, the master vampyre was barley able to re-focus his attention in time to
duck and avoid being reduced to ashes. He looked up at Buffy and smiled as
three of his children crept up on her, however his smile turned to shear
terror when his children went to grab her and were turned to dust by the
unseen force that surrounded her. Vlad screamed to his remaining forces,
"You have to get to the witch she is protecting the slayer!"</p>

<p>Eamonn waved his hand sending several bolts of lighting into the remaining
vampire army as they charged towards them he then through up his hands
sending three vampires who were almost on top of him flying back into a
group of five of their brethren that were rapidly advancing. As Eamonn
waved his hand in the air and reduced the eight vampires to dust another six
of them rushed past him on an intercept course with Willow.</p>

<p>Angel connected a right hook knocking Spike to the ground, but the blonde
vamp managed to kick his legs out from under him before he could finish the
attack. Spike then rolled over quickly and knocked the stake out of Angels
hand and reached to grab it. Angel grabbed Spike and pulled him back before
he could reach the stake, he then head butted the blonde vampire knocking
Spike off of him. He then got to his feet and reached for the stake, as
soon as he had it in his hand he felt Spikes grab him by the ankles and pull
him face first into the ground.</p>

<p>Vlad looked at Buffy as he pulled a sword from his belt, "So the slayer
wants to play with swords, I can’t wait to run you through.."</p>

<p>Buffy pointed her sword at the master vampires chest, "That’s not going to
happen, prepare to pay the price for hurting my beloved."</p>

<p>Vlad swung his sword at Buffy only to have it easily deflected. He quickly
found himself on the defensive as he attempted to fight of the onslaught of
the slayer. Buffy sliced deep into Vlade’s arm sending the master vampyre
into a tirade of slavic curses as he blocked her next two attacks. Vlad then
managed to get a swig past Buffy only to be thrown backwards by the energy
that shot through his sword as he struck Willows protective field. Buffy
moved quickly and elegantly towards him as if she was dancing to the melody
of the bladesong. The master vampyre barely managed to get his sword in
front of him in time to stop Buffys sword from slashing into his neck.</p>

<p>Tristin and Kathryn both fired at the vampires reducing two of them to dust as
Archer and Xander took out another two with their super soakers. Cut into
one of the two remaining vampires with his swords as Tristin threw a
powerful punch sending the other one stumbling backwards. Kathryn quickly
rushed over to aid Giles as the vampire he was fighting knocked the sword
from his hand.</p>

<p>The vampire regained his balance he lunged at Tristin, the slayer in
training jabbed her stake into him as their bodies collided. As she fell
backwards to the ground she saw the vampire burst into dust and knew that
she had been on the mark with the stake. The other vampire knocked Giles to
the ground and was preparing to finish off the watcher when he got hit from
behind. The vampire then spun around and saw Kathryn standing there for
about two seconds before he felt the wooden stake plunge into his heart.</p>

<p>Spike let go of Angels feet as soon as his foe hit the ground then quickly
sprung forward onto the other vampires back. Angel arched his head back
driving the back of his skull into the blonde vampires nose. He felt Spike
hop off his back and quickly got up and spun around. Spike was holding his
broken nose and yelling out in pain. Angel then grabbed him by the back of
the neck and lifted Spikes head up so he could see him face to face. "This
is for all the pain and misery you have caused," growled Angel as he rammed
a stake into the blonde vampire.</p>

<p>Eamonn looked around and saw that only the master vampyre remained, he then
turned around and saw the other standing in a protective circle around the
Bladesingers champion. So he walked over to Giles and turned to watch the
battle.</p>

<p>Angel looked and saw that all his friends were just standing their watching
as Buffy fought the master vampyre. He ran over to Eamonn, "Why isn’t
anyone helping her?"</p>

<p>"This fight is between the Bladesinger and Vlad Tepes, besides she is
already getting all the help she needs from her Champion," Replied Eamonn as
he pointed towards Willow.</p>

<p>A fine blue mist encircled Willows entire body as she gazed at her beloved.
Her mind was completely focused on the Bladesinger and she was unaware
of anyone around her as she continued to project the protective field around
Buffy.</p>

<p>Vlad felt the sword cut through his side and howled out in agony. Buffy
then rammed her blade into the master vampyre’s chest dropping him to his
knees. Vlad tried to counter with a powerful swing but Buffy easily blocked
it. She then disarmed him by severing the hand that the master vampyre was
holding the sword in.</p>

<p>Vlad looked down at his sword and back up at Buffy. He could feel the
bladesong cut through his mind enveloping him in fear. The terror of
knowing he was about to die filled the master vampyre's face as he looked at
the blonde girl who had beaten him, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I’m Buffy Summers, chosen warrior of the Goddess. I am the Bladesinger,"
replied Buffy just before she sent Vlad Tepes Dracul to hell where he
belonged.</p>

<p>Willow heard the sweet melody of Buffy’s bladesong stop and immediately
snapped out of the trance she had put herself in to find her beloved
standing in front of her. Willow then collapsed into Buffy’s arms totally
exhausted from all the energy it had taken her to maintain the protective
field around her beloved.</p>

<p>As Willow fell into Buffy she quickly grabbed her and wrapped her arms
around the redhead. Using her body to support Willow Buffy softly whispered
in her loves ear, "Sweetheart, are you alright?"</p>

<p>"I’m fine, I just am pretty tired from the protection spell."</p>

<p>Buffy kissed Willow on the forehead, "Well then I need to get you back to
the dorm so you can get some rest."</p>

<p>"We're not going back to the warehouse?"</p>

<p>"No, Vlad is no more. It’s safe for us to return to campus now."</p>

<p>Buffy then looked at Eamonn and Giles, "I trust that you have no objections,
not that it really matters because I intend to be alone with my beloved
regardless of your answer."</p>

<p>Eamonn smiled at the Bladesinger then replied, "Go, the two of you need to
be alone, but before you do I wish to tell you that it was an honor to be
allowed to help awaken you and see your powers grow."</p>

<p>"Your leaving aren't you."</p>

<p>"Yes, this world has not been my home for a long time, and you no longer
require my service. My place is with the Goddess in the forever and that is
where I must return to."</p>

<p>Buffy helped Willow walk as the two of them made their way over to Eamonn,
"Thank you, for everything. I don‘t know what we would have done without
you."</p>

<p>"Your welcome"</p>

<p>Willow looked up at Eamonn as she rested against Buffy, "What are we to do
now."</p>

<p>Eamonn put his hand on Giles shoulder, "Take a vacation you earned it and
when Giles returns he will explain everything to you."</p>

<p>"Giles, is leaving?" both girls asked in unison.</p>

<p>"Yes, but only for a short while. He is to be my successor. He will act as
advisor and mentor to the two of you and the knowledge that you need to
serve the Goddess will be given to him. However in order for him to recieve
it he must accompany me to the forever."</p>

<p>There then was a bright flash and both Eamonn and Giles were gone.</p>
