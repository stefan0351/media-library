<p>.</p>
<p>Lilly turned the alarm off with a relieved sigh. They'd been turning it on for a few minutes every hour or so, just in case someone were to come by, but the noise was grating and they'd had no luck so far. She straightened her beanie and sat back in her corner with a sigh. Miley was stretched out on her back, looking wholly uncomfortable and gave Lilly an odd look.</p>
<p>"Why are you wearing that beanie? It's like 80 degrees in here."</p>
<p>"I like beanies. They make me look cool."</p>
<p>Miley snorted and settled farther against her backpack, as if she were trying to find a more comfortable position. Lilly watched her and turned to pull her extra sweatshirt out of her bag. "You want my sweatshirt? You can use it for your back or your head or something."</p>
<p>Miley hesitated, as if she didn't want to take something Lilly might need, but the blonde threw it at her before she could respond. Miley thanked her with a soft smile and bunched the sweatshirt under her head. They were silent again for a while, with Miley just resting and Lilly actually cracking open her textbook. Perhaps the one positive from this ordeal might be her actually passing her class, considering she'd studied more in the past 24 hours than she had the entire semester.</p>
<p>"Hey Lilly?" Miley's voice broke through the silence and Lilly looked up immediately, concerned by the odd tone in her friend's voice. "Can I ask you something weird?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and Miley looked away, focused intently on playing with the zipper on her sweatshirt. "How did you know you were gay?"</p>
<p>Lilly didn't answer right away, too stumped by the question. It wasn't that the question was new to her, she'd been asked it many times, but she hadn't expected it from Miley. It was one of those questions people asked either if they were totally against homosexuality or if they'd had wondered about themselves and Miley hadn't seemed like either one of those. She closed her book, deciding it didn't matter. She really liked Miley, as a friend, though she couldn't fully deny she was somewhat attracted to the girl, and she would answer whatever question was asked of her.</p>
<p>"I didn't really <b>know</b> until I was 17 or 18, I guess. I mean, that's when I knew what it was, but I'd felt different my whole life. I always hung out with the boys and I had crushes on the girls, even if I didn't really know that's what it was. It's hard to explain, I guess…you just know. It's deep inside of you, like something steering you, which you can't control. It's just like you know you like boys, except you didn't really have to think about it or figure out what it was."</p>
<p>Miley nodded, though still wouldn't meet her eyes. Lilly just watched her, growing more and more curious. After several minutes of silence, when Lilly almost went back to her book assuming they were done talking about this, Miley looked up at her, eyes conveying a vulnerability that made Lilly's heart thunder.</p>
<p>"I never really…told anyone this, but…there were times when I wondered whether I was…you know. Jake was just always right there and it was easy with him and I thought it's what I was supposed to do."</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed hard, forcing her racing thoughts to slow down. Here she had a gorgeous, funny, sweet girl telling her she might be gay and Lilly certainly didn't want to screw this up. For a split second she thought about how a rush of excitement had washed over her at Miley's words, but then she stopped herself. Miley wasn't looking for a date, she wanted advice and a friend and Lilly would give her that.</p>
<p>"You didn't love Jake?"</p>
<p>"I did. And in the beginning I really was smitten with him, but I wonder if I fabricated that, too. I mean, he was hot, don't get me wrong, but all the girls were fawning over him and I figured I had to, as well. I wonder if all those years I spent with him were just…me pretending."</p>
<p>Miley sounded sad, like she had lost something important and Lilly wanted nothing more than to comfort her. "Well, you must have felt something for him, right? You made this little soccer player together after all."</p>
<p>Miley smiled at Lilly's lame joke, resting a hand on her belly. "Sure, I loved him, but I don't think I loved him like I was supposed to. I never felt sparks, there were no butterflies, no tingles and I never even enjoyed it when we slept together. What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"Maybe it was just Jake?"</p>
<p>"I've made out with a few other boys and it was the same. Just sloppy and uninspiring. I always thought that's just how it was, but what if…what if I didn't enjoy it 'cause I'm…gay?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what to tell you, Miley. I don't think it's something you can just figure out like that. You have to <b>feel</b> it. Have you ever liked a girl?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged, blushing. "I think so. Thinking back to High School, there was this girl I always tried to be near and it made me so excited just to talk to her. We were friends, so I thought it was normal. Well, a few girls have flirted with me at clubs, but nothing ever came of it."</p>
<p>"Did you enjoy it when they flirted?" asked Lilly, trying to stomp down the strange sensation of anger overcoming her at the thought of some random no-good lesbian seducing Miley.</p>
<p>"Yeah, of course, but doesn't everyone?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged. "I guess. Miley, only you can figure out whether you're gay or not. Just take your time, do what feels right. I guess what I'm saying is 'Follow your heart'."</p>
<p>Miley grinned at the cheesy line, but then shook her head. "I guess it won't matter now. No girl will want to date a confused 21-year-old with a newborn and stretch marks."</p>
<p>"They'd be a fool not to, Miles. You're sweet, funny and beautiful and if that baby gets half your charm, he's gonna turn some heads," said Lilly softly, but earnestly.</p>
<p>Miley met her eyes, astonished and gave Lilly such a brilliant, shy smile it turned her insides into mush. Lilly couldn't believe she had basically just hit on the other girl, but thankfully Miley hadn't seemed to mind or notice.</p>
<p>"You're sweet, Lilly, thanks. And you figured out my nickname."</p>
<p>"What?" Lilly could hardly remember what she had said, the image of Miley flashing that grateful smile at her etched permanently into her brain.</p>
<p>"Miles; my family calls me that. I guess since we're friends now I'll let you get away with it," grinned Miley and Lilly chuckled, nodding.</p>
<p>"Alright, <b>Miles</b>. That's good to now."</p>
<p>They both returned to their books, smiling. Lilly was actually getting her homework done, but every once in a while she'd sneak a glance at her companion. A few times she even caught Miley looking at her as well and that discovery made her only smile harder.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>"Do you think after we get out of here we should join a Rummy club and hustle them?"</p>
<p>Lilly looked at the other girl and made a face. She threw her cards down with a sigh and leaned back to stretch. The one useful thing, other than her jug of water, she had carried was a deck of cards and after hours upon hours of playing every game imaginable, they'd even grown tired of that. She looked at her watch and groaned.</p>
<p>"It's barely midnight."</p>
<p>"That means it's almost Sunday. We're gonna get out of here, Lilly." Miley sounded confident, but her voice belied her fatigue and discomfort.</p>
<p>Lilly didn't feel like they'd ever get out and Monday morning seemed like a lifetime away, but she kept her thoughts to herself. She didn't want to worry or upset Miley. "Well, I'm sure if you hadn't been here, I would've gone crazy by now."</p>
<p>Miley smiled. "Who said you're not crazy already?"</p>
<p>Lilly stuck out her tongue, though she enjoyed the teasing. She couldn't help but feel there was something inherently flirty about their teasing, but she refused to let herself dwell on it. They were both tired and hungry and probably delusional. They had worked out a schedule for when to eat Miley's remaining food to prevent serious hunger pains, but Lilly's stomach still growled loudly. She imagined it could only be worse for Miley and Lilly had refused to share the sole apple, insisting it be eaten by Miley alone.</p>
<p>"How's the little soccer player doing?" Lilly said it just to tease the brunette, who adamantly insisted her son was not going to be a jock.</p>
<p>"Preparing for a great career in academics," answered Miley and made a face at Lilly. "He's really restless tonight. Maybe he's as bored as we are?"</p>
<p>Lilly grinned. "Though he should be used to being stuck in a tiny space with nothing to do. Maybe he's ready to come out?"</p>
<p>Miley gaped at her, horrified. "Don't say that!"</p>
<p>"Why? He's coming soon, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but…in a hospital, with strong painkillers available and my Mamaw and Aunt Dolly there to get me through," said Miley, a sudden panic shining through her voice.</p>
<p>Lilly sat up straight, trying to undo the panic she had unwittingly inflicted upon her friend. "No, that's what I meant. That he's getting ready. You know, he's probably got a lot of loose ends to tie up in there…cancelling his lease, turning off his utilities, changing his mailing address. It's gonna take him two weeks I'd say."</p>
<p>Miley gave her a strange look, but then laughed, her panic visibly deflating. In light of the increasing temperature inside the elevator, Miley had taken off her sweatshirt and Lilly thought she could see ripples against her t-shirt, where the baby's foot or hand hit her belly. It was mesmerizing and terrifying all at the same time and both of them watched as the baby continued to move. After a while, Miley looked at Lilly, her eyes unguarded, though she seemed nervous.</p>
<p>"Lilly? Will you do me a favor?" The way Miley was biting her lip made Lilly somewhat apprehensive about this favor, but she knew she couldn't deny this girl.</p>
<p>"Anything. Except for a foot rub, I have a foot phobia."</p>
<p>Miley smiled at Lilly's joke, but her face returned to its slightly agitated state almost immediately. Her voice was so soft when she spoke, Lilly had to strain to hear her. "Will you…kiss me?"</p>
