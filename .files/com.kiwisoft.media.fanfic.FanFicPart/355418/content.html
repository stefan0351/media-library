<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Seventeen -->

<p>Brooke was almost back to the cabin, distressed at the fact that it had been so long and they hadn?t found Sam when she heard Josh shout.</p>
<p>"Holy shit! Brooke! I found her!" She ran to where Josh was yelling from, barely a hundred feet from the grounds and found Josh brushing off Sam?s curled up form lying on the ground.</p>
<p>"Oh God," she gasped as she and Lily bent over the frighteningly still form.</p>
<p>"She was almost home," Nicole whispered to no one.</p>
<p>"Her pulse is weak, Brooke, but she?s alive," Lily assured the lanky cheerleader.</p>
<p>"Josh, can you carry her back?" Brooke asked. Josh nodded and gingerly picked up the precious cargo. Carmen and Harrison, drawn by the commotion, ran ahead to get blankets and things ready.</p>
<p>"Take her upstairs to my room, the bed is the biggest," Brooke instructed when they reached the house. Josh complied wordlessly. "Carmen, Lily, I need warm blankets and water?Mary Cherry, help them get some hot liquids with lots of calories, sugar, carbs, proteins that sorta thing. But no caffeine, OK? Harrison, see if you can get a hold of the Ski Patrol and tell them we have a hypothermic teen that needs medical attention ASAP," Brooke took total control drawing on her limited knowledge from her visits to Colorado as a child.</p>
<p>"What can I do to help?" Nicole asked. Brooke turned on her with a murderous glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Stay as far away from Sam as possible," she growled before heading up the stairs behind Josh.</p>
<p>Josh set Sam gently down on the bed as Brooke entered the room.</p>
<p>"Grab some of her dry clothes so I can change her into them. Warm stuff, Josh. Hurry," Brooke asked. Josh ran off to Sam?s room while Brooke looked the prone figure over. She took in the pale skin, purplish lips, the deep cut to her forehead all with a clinical eye, knowing if she let her emotions get in the way that Sam might suffer.</p>
<p>"Here Brooke," Josh said entering the room carrying several sets of sweats, socks, a few towels, and other assorted things for Sam. Brooke said thanks and started to strip Sam?s soaking wet clothes from her.</p>
<p>"I need the first aid kit from the bathroom too, Josh. OK?"</p>
<p>"You got it," and he was off again to retrieve it.</p>
<p>"OK, Sammy, let?s get you dry," Brooke spoke softly to the unconscious girl. She took off Sam?s jacket and then carefully removed Sam?s boots and socks, worried at how red and angry her feet looked. She redressed them in several pairs of warm thick socks and then started on Sam?s top. </p>
<p>"Please don?t end up mad at me for this, Sam," she whispered. "It?s for your own good." Despite the fact that Brooke knew this to be true, she couldn?t help but feel slightly guilty at seeing Sam so vulnerable. She stripped Sam completely down bit by bit, changing her into dry clothes as she went. As she finished with Sam?s pants and her new dry sweats were on, Josh returned with the first aid kit and Lily with warm blankets and hot juice in tow.</p>
<p>"I read somewhere that diluted jell-o was good for hypothermia victims, Brooke," Lily explained handing over the cup. "So we started with that."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke said as she cleaned and dressed the nasty gash on Sam?s forehead. "She banged her head," she said absently.</p>
<p>"Harrison said he can?t get through on the CB. He, Carmen and Mary Cherry are hiking down to the nearest Station for help," Josh spoke up. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Storms messing with reception probably," she said. "Help me wrap her in the blankets." They placed the warm blankets on Sam?s core points, her neck, underarms and groin to encourage re-warming and avoid after-drop. Because Brooke?s knowledge was sketchy at best, she was taking all the precautions she could. They then wrapped Sam up in the covers from the bed cocoon-like and Brooke climbed into bed with her to provide simple body heat.</p>
<p>"I don?t want to leave her alone," she said softly. "Let me know when the Rescue Squad gets here," she said. Lily and Josh nodded and left the room.</p>
<p>"Hang on, Sammy," Brooke whispered into Sam?s cold ear as the other girl still shivered. "I?m right here. You?re going to be OK. I promise I?ll take care of you."</p>
<p>"Come back to me, Sammy. I love you."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam?s shivering continued on and off for another few hours as Brooke lay holding the injured girl. She had almost slipped into a semi-doze herself when Brooke heard a low pain-filled moan come from the form wrapped securely in her arms. She lifted her head and looked down at Sam?s now flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" she whispered. Sam huddled down into her blanket cocoon and shivered.</p>
<p>"Hel?lp?c?colllld?" she gasped incoherent. She moaned again, still in pain and obviously scared. Brooke tightened her hold.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy, you?re safe now. I?ve got you," she whispered almost in tears. She hated hearing such pain coming from Sam but not be able to help. She also knew that Sam wasn?t really conscious just yet and somewhere in her frozen haze thought she was still lost outdoors in the storm. </p>
<p>"Would it help if I talked to you, Sammy?" Brooke asked quietly. "Would you know that you were safe then?" she wondered out loud as soft frightened cries and sobs seemed to continuously tumble from Sam?s mouth. She felt Sam relax somewhat at hearing her voice and she reached over to brush some still damp hair away from Sam?s cheek.</p>
<p>"I?ll talk so that you know you?re not alone and you?re right here with me, Sammy," Brooke told her lovingly. "You?re safe back in the cabin. Josh found you, you were almost back to the front door. But you must have fallen and hit your head before you got there. I hope you?re OK." There was a dark bruise forming around the gash on Sam?s forehead where she?d struck it that was worrying Brooke somewhat.</p>
<p>"So, I changed you out of your wet clothes and put you into dry ones," Brooke blushed. "I hope you don?t mind. I had to strip you completely down but I swear my intentions were honorable. But?you do have a beautiful body, Sam," she confessed shyly. "I know, not appropriate but, I wanted to tell you now because I know I?d never have the guts to tell you when you were conscious and alert." Brooke nuzzled the nape of Sam?s neck, trying to will some of her energy and body heat into the silent brunette.</p>
<p>"Actually there are a lot of things I want to say to you that I never had the strength to say. That?s why Nicole did what she did. I?m not saying that she only dated you to get at me but?God Sam, it?s a long story," Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Then again, I guess you?re not going anywhere," she pointed out. A miserable whimper escaped Sam?s lips and turned into a low keening wail.</p>
<p>"What?s wrong, Sammy?" Brooke asked alarmed. She moved so that she was looking down at Sam?s slack face. Sam frowned in her unconscious state and started to mumble.</p>
<p>"Sssor?rrrry Bbbbroooke," she muttered through still chattering teeth. Brooke sighed again but was heartened by the fact that Sam?s shivering seemed to be lessening and her skin was warmer.</p>
<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for, Sam," Brooke assured the other girl, laying down next to her again and turning Sam so that Sam?s head was on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you a few things while I have your undivided attention," Brooke said with a sad smirk. "I?ve had feelings for you for a long time. Deep feelings for you. Even before you came out to everyone about your own sexuality I knew about my own. And when you came out, I thought, ?God, here?s my chance. Maybe, just maybe Sam will give me a chance to prove to her how much I care?. But I got scared. I couldn?t seem to find the right time, the right words. And then, it was too late. Nicole, Nicole who KNEW how I felt, who HAD known for a while how I felt about you USED it against me and went after you herself. And while I knew I still could have told you how I felt, especially given the fact that your relationship with Nicole wasn?t really what you and I would call a ?relationship?, I was still scared," Brooke confessed softly.</p>
<p>"So I hid behind the excuse of not wanting to pull you in two directions. I wanted to see you happy and I thought that you were. As much as I loved you, I was still too scared of you not loving me back. I couldn?t handle that, Sam. I still can?t. But I need to tell you this now, I have to get it off my chest. I?ve come too close to losing you and it frightened me. Even if you don?t remember a word I?ve said, I?LL know that I?ve said it and that?s enough." Brooke took a deep cleansing breath.</p>
<p>"I love you Samantha McPherson. With all my heart and soul," she admitted to the still form in her arms. Sam burrowed further into her chest and sighed contentedly, her shaking finally stopping. Brooke took that as a good sign and kissed the top of Sam?s head.</p>
<p>"Why don?t we both get some rest, huh, Sammy?"</p>
