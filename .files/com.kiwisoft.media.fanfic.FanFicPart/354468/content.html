<!-- Complete \ Part 5 -->

<P>When the all- consuming blackness altered, she heard voices. They were  muffled though, with only the deeper vocal resonances audible, as if they were  being listened to underwater. Whoever they were, there was a frantic sense of  urgency to them. Unable to identify the voices, she tried to open her eyes and  see her companions but the blackness stayed. The feeling was bizarre; she felt  her eyes were open, yet could only see an unending blackness. She realised that  the tenuous perception she had on reality was slipping, the slightest stimuli  fading away as oblivion washed over her.</P>
<P>When she heard the voices a second time, despite still only being able to  hear the lower register, she detected a less panicked tone. There was less  shouting and she realised that she could now differentiate the voices into  separate distinct people. There were two deeper masculine voices and one  slightly more feminine one. Once again, her eyes would not comply and open for  her and she felt a wave of frustration flood through her as the isolation  continued. All too soon, the inky black well of darkness robbed her of a chance  to attract the voices’ attention.</P>
<P>The voices came again. This time there was clarity to them and she could  identify their owners. With a concerted effort, she forced her eyes open. They  battled against her but somehow she prised them open, feeling her pupils  contract quickly to regulate the amount of light shining onto her retinas. She  wondered if she would have the same trouble getting her voice to work as her  vision sharpened and focused on the concerned faces of the Captain, Doctor and  Tom Paris staring down at her. Her peripheral vision gave her enough information  to recognise where she was and she assumed by her position that she was lying on  a bio-bed in Sickbay.</P>
<P>Belatedly, she realised that they were speaking to her. Rolling her tongue  around inside her mouth and swallowing repeatedly in order to lubricate her  throat, she tried to answer but was alarmed at how weak her voice sounded, as  all she managed was a parched croak.</P>
<P>"Just lie still and rest. You’ve been through one hell of an ordeal", the  Captain spoke softly, laying a hand on her shoulder and squeezing it  reassuringly.</P>
<P>She did not want to lie still though. There was a burning desire for  information that she wanted to quench. She coughed, hoping that the action would  strengthen her pathetic voice. "Captain, how’s B’Elanna?"</P>
<P>The three faces looking down at her locked eyes instantaneously. The action  alarmed Seven and she raised herself onto her elbows, as much as the restraining  hands would allow, ignoring the protests from her colleagues as she scanned the  room for the young Klingon.</P>
<P>On an adjacent bio-bed, Seven saw the hybrid engineer, seemingly asleep on  her back, arms lying down her sides. The advanced medical monitoring equipment  arched over her torso, the panel at one side sporadically lighting up as new  input was received.</p>
<P>The statuesque blonde attempted to sit up further and swing her legs round to  get off her bed but the Doctor interjected before she completed the manoeuvre.  "Please Seven, stay where you are for the moment. Do you have any memory of what  happened at all?" he asked as he moved the tiny cylindrical portion of the  medical tricorder around her head to take readings.</P>
<P>At first, Seven felt a mystified confusion at the Doctor’s words but his  question acted as a catalyst and her confusion dissipated. The floodgate to her  memories opened. With a burning intensity, her last conscious moments deluged  her….</p>
<P>She remembered lunging forward, B’Elanna’s name being ripped from her throat  as an anguish she had never experienced before tore through her, almost  paralysing her with fear.</P>
<P>She was at the engineer’s side instantly; frenziedly feeling for a pulse at  the half klingon’s neck as her eyes scanned the woman thoroughly, looking for  any indication that B’Elanna was still alive. Torment turned to relief as she  saw B’Elanna’s chest rise but the movement was abnormal, her respirations rapid  and irregular. Her pulse too was barely palpable and Seven’s relief vanished as  quickly as it had appeared. The rapid swing of emotions was taking its toll on  the recovering drone and a small part of her distantly realised that she was  starting to panic. This revelation ironically served to agitate her alarm and  Seven spiralled rapidly down the path to hysteria.</P>
<P>Feeling helpless, she swung round and lashed out at Tom. "Do something!" She  demanded, grabbing the collar of his jacket and propelling him closer to the  unconscious woman with a vicious twist of the material.</P>
<P>Tom, who had run a series of diagnostics on B’Elanna from behind Seven,  adjusted his neck, moving the material of his tunic sufficiently to restore  circulation and become more comfortable in the hold of the panicked ex-borg. "I  don’t understand this, Seven. All her readings are displaying normal parameters.  According to my tricorder, there’s nothing wrong with her".</P>
<P>Seven tightened her grip furiously. "Does she look <I>normal, </I>Lieutenant  Paris?" she hissed, venom lacing her words.</P>
<P>Tom had to admit the blonde woman had a point but he was baffled. He called  back to Janeway desperately, unable to turn to her due to the vice- like grip  the ex-drone had on his tunic. "Any success getting the Doc back on-line?"</P>
<P>The Captain barely registered the exchange between the helmsman and  Astrometrics officer as she battled to eradicate the nanoprobes from the  holo-matrix buffer, her face set determinedly. She’d beaten the Borg Queen; a  few of their nanoprobes weren’t going to defeat her. Her hands attacked the  console, running a complicated sequence of procedures that Janeway hoped would  purge the buffer.</P>
<P>With a snarl of satisfaction, she turned to watch as the Doctor materialised  next to her.</P>
<P>"Please state the.." the EMH began automatically.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna’s hurt", interjected Seven desperately, her voice tight with  concern.</P>
<P>The Doctor took in the scene instantly and grabbed the tricorder from Paris’  left hand.</P>
<P>"I suggest you let go of Mr Paris before we have another casualty", he  replied laconically.</P>
<P>He frowned into the tricorder before making adjustments on the instrument  "These readings don’t make sense", he mused, almost to himself.</P>
<P>"That’s what I said", agreed Tom, shooting Seven a look of aggrieved  justification.</P>
<P>"Will you stop prevaricating and help her", insisted Seven, her voice rising  as her hysteria continued to mount.</P>
<P>"Calm down, Seven", the Doctor advised as he bent forward and took the  unconscious engineer into his arms.</P>
<P>He stood up effortlessly and placed the dark woman onto a nearby bio-bed.  Seven relinquished her hold on Tom to follow the Doctor and, no longer having a  death grip to pull against, the pilot fell back with an undignified grunt before  picking himself up and joining the others at B’Elanna’s side.</P>
<P>The Doctor looked at all the monitoring data accumulated during the procedure  and made a series of adjustments on the panel. "You need to treat the patient  not the instruments, Mr Paris. One of the first rules of medicine", he reminded  his assistant.</P>
<P>Paris looked suitably chagrined and observed the EMH closely, hoping to  redeem himself in some way.</P>
<P>Suddenly the prone engineer’s body began to spasm, her back flexing and  extending as her limbs thrashed convulsively. Seven’s hysteria returned as the  Doctor and Paris flew into action.</P>
<P>"20mg cintromazapine", barked the EMH as he rapidly digested the data. "Damn,  her acetycholine levels are off the scale", he murmured.</p>
<P>"What’s happening?" demanded the young Borg. Janeway put her arm round the  willowy blonde in an effort to comfort her, but Seven shrugged it off angrily,  not wanting succour. "Doctor?" she prompted, her eyes fixed on the convulsing  engineer.</P>
<P>The EMH ignored her and continued to process the information from the console  as Tom administered the hypospray.</P>
<P>"No effect", stated Paris, as he grabbed further hyposprays.</P>
<P>"I can see that", replied the Doctor curtly. "Increase dose to 40mg".</P>
<P>Suddenly, an alarm wailed on the monitoring panel as B’Elanna’s body stopped  moving.</P>
<P>"She’s arrested!" exclaimed Janeway from her place next to Seven.</P>
<P>"Everyone’s a doctor", remarked the EMH sarcastically as he began the  resuscitation protocol.</P>
<P>It was too much for Seven. She had approached B’Elanna to help her overcome  the cortical inhibitor problem and now B’Elanna was dying, if not dead, she  thought histrionically. Her emotions now free to run rampant, Seven had no  experience in controlling them. The escalating hysteria running through her was  overwhelming. …..</P>
<P>From her semi-recumbent position on the bio-bed, Seven stared accusingly at  the Captain. "You sedated me", she asserted angrily.</P>
<P>"I had to, Seven", the Captain replied in a soft tone. "Your", she hesitated  slightly, "concern for B’Elanna interfered with the Doctor’s work", she  explained, fervently hoping that Seven would not over-react again.</P>
<P>Surprisingly, Seven looked thoughtful for a moment. "Then why was it so  difficult for me to regain consciousness?" she asked, recalling her recent  battle.</P>
<P>The Captain looked uncomfortable and adjusted her position slightly,  unwilling to answer.</p>
<P>"She over-cooked the quantity. You had enough tranquilliser to knock out an  elephant", the Doctor interjected on Janeway’s behalf.</P>
<P>It took a moment for Seven to recall what an elephant was but decided not to  pursue the issue.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" she prompted again.</P>
<P>"She’s alive", reassured the Doctor. "But we’re unsure how badly affected her  mind is. I’ve kept her sedated to give her an opportunity to recover from the  stress she’s been through. I’ll wake her in the morning."</P>
<P>"What happened to her?" Seven asked, hungry for more information.</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes launched an attack on B’Elanna through the holo-matrix  buffer. They tried to overload her synapses and break down her own neural  control. Fortunately she managed to put up a defensive barrier. However the  sustained onslaught caused some areas of her brain to suffer chemical  breakdown."</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes widened in alarm so the Doctor continued hurriedly. "My medical  expertise allowed me to repair a lot of the damage, but until she is awake, I  can’t know for sure if there are any permanent after-effects from her prolonged  contact with the bio-neural link." He sighed apologetically, wanting to be able  to give total reassurance but morally unable to do so. "Try not to worry too  much. We’ll just have to take each stage as it comes".</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes briefly, allowing her emotions to course through her.  The conflict of relief that B’Elanna was still alive and anguish that she was  still in danger was confusing to deal with. She felt a hand take hers and she  looked at Tom.</P>
<P>"The good news is that you’re fine Seven. The bio-neural circuitry has been  integrated perfectly. Looks like you’ve got your emotions." He told her quietly,  surprised to see a single tear roll down her alabaster cheek. He wiped it away  with his thumb as the Doctor ran his tricorder over her. "I cannot seek comfort  in that until I know B’Elanna is functioning normally", she replied  miserably.</P>
<P>"I can release you from sickbay, Seven. However I think it would be wise not  to be on your own for the next twenty four hours", the Doctor told her.</p>
<P>Janeway opened her mouth to speak but was prohibited by Tom as he smiled at  Seven. "Don’t worry Doc, I’ll look after her." Accepting that Tom was the more  logical choice to be with Seven, the Captain shut her mouth and decided to say  nothing. Her time would come, she decided darkly.</p>
<P>"Will you let me know if there’s any change in B’Elanna’s condition?" Seven  asked as stood up from the bio-bed. The Doctor nodded his agreement and the tall  Astrometrics officer allowed Tom to lead her out of Sickbay. She stole a final  glance at the unconscious form of B’Elanna Torres before the doors hissed shut,  feeling her heart somersault with worry for the half klingon.</P>
<P>She turned to Tom who was waiting patiently next to her. "I want to see the  children," she told him flatly.</P>
<P>"Um, I’m not sure that’s such a good idea, Seven", Tom hedged, concerned that  Seven might not be able to cope with another emotionally charged encounter.</P>
<P>Seven looked at him and raised her enhanced eyebrow in defiance. "I am going  to see the children Tom. It will make no difference to me whether you accompany  me or not."</P>
<P>Tom flinched inwardly, uncomfortable that the ex-drone did not care about his  attendance. He nodded his agreement, and the two officers made their way to  Cargo Bay Two.</P>
<P>Once there, Seven hurried over to the children with a mixture of dread and  excitement, wondering how she would react to her "family". As she pulled Mizoti  into a warm embrace, she smiled widely, her worry evaporating as the joy of  their closeness enveloped her. They asked her questions about the procedure,  probing deeply into the technical aspects as well as how the results might  propagate. Seven found she was not embarrassed by their questioning and was  happy to share the experience with them.</P>
<P>"Does this mean that we have to go through the same procedure?" asked Rebi,  nervously tugging at his shirt hem.</P>
<P>Seven shook her head as she answered, resting her hand on his arm to still  his fidgeting. "No. None of you have an inhibitor. It may be that they are only  given to particular drones or that they get introduced at a later stage of  development. I do not know why, but only I was affected by this." She saw  unmasked relief flit across the children’s faces as she told them. She too was  gladdened by this quirk, as she couldn’t ask B’Elanna to go through the  procedure again and doubted that the Captain would give permission.</P>
<P>With their desire for information sated, Seven ensured that the children were  properly entertained for the evening, asking Neelix to visit and relate another  ghost story for them. She organised their nutritional requirements for the  evening and generally fussed around them until Icheb approached her.</P>
<P>"Go and rest Seven. We’re fine now we know that you’re functioning normally.  You must need to regenerate by now", he reasoned.</p>
<P>Tom pursued the matter further. "Come on Seven, Neelix will call if there’s a  problem. You’ve trusted him before. Come back to my quarters. I’ll stay nearby  while you sleep just in case there are any problems." He tugged at her sleeve as  she continued to hesitate. Icheb nodded at her encouragingly as the other  children busied themselves with games of kadis-kot.</P>
<P>Seven sighed. "Tom, I would prefer to regenerate. It would be more beneficial  for me than normal sleep", she explained.</P>
<P>"Would you at least have dinner with me then?" he asked hopefully.</P>
<P>Seven nodded her acquiescence, realising that she needed to talk to Tom  privately. At least she could take the opportunity to do that in the seclusion  of his quarters.</P>
<P>They shared an uncomplicated meal that Seven ate mechanically, wondering over  her feelings for both Tom and B’Elanna. The young ex-drone now realised that she  didn’t love Tom and was equally certain that she could not grow to love him  while the fiery Chief Engineer consumed all her thoughts. The more she analysed  her feelings, the more convinced she became that she was in love with B’Elanna.  These last few weeks had served to bring out her emotions. Her anxiety for  B’Elanna whilst she remained in sickbay highlighted those emotions. Seven almost  laughed at the irony. Her newly unleashed emotions had almost cost her the one  person she wanted to share them with. What she found most difficult to do was  articulate her feelings to Tom however, without hurting him.</P>
<P>Tom, uncomfortable in the silence, stole frequent glances at Seven, trying to  read her usually impassive face. He was surprised to see a whole gamut of  emotions splayed across her visage as she contemplated something of great  significance.</P>
<P>He jumped as she sighed suddenly and peered at her closely. "Are you all  right Seven?" he asked, worried that the procedure was taking its toll on the  young Borg.</p>
<P>"Tom, I have to say something to you," Seven began and then hesitated as the  words she wanted to speak failed to form into intelligible sentences.</P>
<P>Tom sat back, knowing what was about to happen. He had gone through too many  break-ups not to recognise the signs. They never got any easier though, he  decided as his stomach lurched at the expectation of the following words.</P>
<P>"Tom, I cannot continue this relationship. I do not love you…"</P>
<P>"But you’ve just had the inhibitor removed. At least give yourself a chance  with me to see what happens", Tom interrupted quickly.</P>
<P>"My relationship with you, or lack of it, has nothing to do with the  inhibitor", Seven continued carefully.</p>
<P>Tom looked at her shrewdly. "Are you in love with someone else then?" he  probed.</P>
<P>Seven fidgeted, uncomfortable at the sudden scrutiny and surprised by the  helmsman’s insight. "I do not know," she replied hesitantly but continued on  before Paris could interject again. "I need to investigate my feelings further  on this. It would be unfair of me to do this whilst still involved with you".  She hoped that her words had not been too harsh but realised that there would be  no easy way of telling him.</P>
<P>Paris slumped in his chair dejectedly and sighed dramatically. "Well I’ve  been dumped in worse ways", he told her with a watery smile.</P>
<P>Seven returned the smile just as weakly, recognising that he had accepted his  fate graciously.</P>
<P>"I think it would be prudent if I returned to my alcove to regenerate Tom",  She told him, not wishing to prolong his agony. She stood up but swayed as her  legs straightened. Instantly, Tom was on his feet and by her side.</P>
<P>"Hey, what’s up?" he asked, steadying her with strong hands on her  shoulders.</P>
<P>"I am fatigued. I must regenerate", she explained, her face a pasty white as  the colour drained from it, as if to highlight her condition.</P>
<P>"Look, I can escort you back, but you can just as easily crash in my bed",  Tom offered. "I’ll sleep on the couch out here. That way, I’m close by if you  need anything", he reasoned. Seven was surprised by his generosity after her  rejection. She felt her body sway again as exhaustion took hold of her. Not  wanting the long trip back to Cargo Bay Two, Seven nodded and stumbled into  Tom’s room, falling heavily onto the bed and barely registering Tom covering her  as sleep overcame her. A tiny smile tugged at her lips as her last waking  thought was how easy she found it to fall asleep.</P>
<P>Tom looked at the slumbering woman for a moment before leaving the room,  extinguishing the lighting as he exited. He grabbed a spare blanket from a  storage compartment and threw it at the couch in preparation for later. He sat  down and stretched his legs out onto the nearby coffee table. He was too  emotionally wrung out to sleep yet. Tom took his time winding down, allowing his  mind to digest all the interaction that had taken place, wondering who it was  that had stolen Seven from him.</P>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<P>The Doctor re-checked the instrumentation panel before preparing the  hypospray that would revive Lieutenant Torres. He might only be a hologram but  he realised that he was nervous about waking the half-klingon, concerned over  what he might find once he could examine her fully.</P>
<P>Steeling himself to expect the worst, yet fervently hoping that she was  recovered, he pressed the cylindrical instrument to her neck.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes snapped open and a hand batted away the hypospray as she  bolted upright, a look of bewildered alarm on her face.</P>
<P>"At ease, Lieutenant." The gravelly voice of the Captain broke through the  defensive barrier B’Elanna had automatically erected and she scanned the room to  see both Janeway and the EMH standing next to her bed. She pulled her knees up  and hugged them, trying to relax her tense body and she looked at the Doctor,  her face clouded with confusion.</P>
<P>"What happened?" she asked simply, absently wondering when she had consumed  all the blood wine that must surely be responsible for the pounding headache she  was now suffering.</P>
<P>"The procedure was a success for Seven, but at your expense", the EMH replied  cryptically, prompting B’Elanna to narrow her eyes at him, tacitly asking him to  explain further.</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes mounted an attack on you, trying to force your brain into  chemical breakdown. Fortunately, you fended off the attack, but the prolonged  exposure with the bio-neural link took its toll on you and you nearly died.  Providentially, my medical proficiency kept you alive once again. However, up  until you regained consciousness, I wasn’t sure if there was any permanent  damage". The Doctor tried to keep the explanation as short and as simple as  possible, certain that the dark engineer would be unreceptive to a more  voluminous description of the events.</P>
<P>His explanation brought back the memories of the process. B’Elanna squeezed  her eyes shut briefly at the recollection of the pain and fear she had felt  whilst trying to save herself from the nanoprobes. Interlaced with the anxiety  induced by the link was a feeling of awe that she had effectively controlled the  bio-neural circuitry. It had been an incredible achievement to actually command  materials mentally. Her analytical mind wondered briefly if that control could  be utilised again if the situation so demanded it and the engineer vowed to look  into the topic.</P>
<P>One of the strangest sensations was that she felt like she had been a witness  to the events, watching from a corner of the room as her body at first stayed  stock-still, in a rigid pose of pain, before slumping to the floor, the physical  body giving way before the cerebral body was finished. She even had a vague  image of Seven and Tom standing over her before the memories receded to  nothingness. The exhaustion and pain her mind and body had experienced was  emulated again as she sat there but she doggedly shrugged the sensations off,  convinced that they were psychosomatic side effects of the torment she  suffered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna rested her head in her hands, massaging her temples gently. "So  Seven’s okay then?" she asked, disregarding the agony pounding behind her eyes  and ignoring the dialogue that centred on her own fate.</P>
<P>"She will be. The circuitry has been integrated perfectly. She just needs  some time to recover", the Captain answered. "Congratulations, B’Elanna. You did  a fine job. I’m just glad you’re here in one piece to realise it." B’Elanna  nodded at the Captain’s praise but felt disappointed that Seven wasn’t here too.  She was probably regenerating still, she reasoned logically but the thought  didn’t really appease the klingon.</P>
<P>The Doctor selected another hypospray and placed it at the dark woman’s neck.  Immediately, the intensity of her headache diminished and B’Elanna smiled at him  gratefully.</p>
<P>"So when can I get out of here?" she asked.</p>
<P>The Doctor grinned at her. "I still find it surprising how much you dislike  being in sickbay considering you’re in here more than any other member of this  crew."</P>
<P>"It must be the Chief Medical Officer’s winning personality", she retorted  glibly.</P>
<P>"I’ll bear that in mind for next time", the Doctor shot back as he ran his  tricorder over her head. " I’m relieved to say that your readings are normal.  I’ll release you from sickbay on the condition that you rest. I need to keep a  close eye on you though, so you must report back here in eight hours for a  check-up. You’ve been relieved from duty till I pass you fit so it’s probably  wise to take my advice." He continued as the shorter woman swung her legs over  the bio-bed to alight from it. "However, if you feel anything abnormal or have  any concerns whatsoever, come back immediately. Neurological problems can be  notoriously difficult to detect." As he spoke, he placed a small, silver,  shell-like object just behind her ear. "This is a cortical monitor. It will  reassure me that you really are all right and alert me if your brain activity  becomes aberrant and you’re unable to contact me yourself."</p>
<P>B’Elanna recognised the concern the EMH was displaying and appreciated his  attempt to minimise her stay in sickbay. However, she couldn’t shake a sensation  of general irritation at all the attention she was receiving. "Doc, I’d just  like to get out of here", B’Elanna reminded him, trying to cut short his  diatribe.</p>
<P>Janeway smiled at her and squeezed the younger woman’s arm, offering her  support, as always, with a tactile gesture. "Take all the time you need,  B’Elanna. It will only be on the Doctor’s behest that I allow you to come back  on duty".</p>
<P>The Klingon nodded mutely and pushed herself off the bio-bed. As the small,  dark-haired woman disappeared behind the closing sickbay doors, the Captain  turned to the EMH. "Will she make a full recovery then, Doctor?"</P>
<P>The Doctor paused momentarily. "It’s difficult to say, Captain. Physically,  the prognosis is good, as long as I can keep a close monitor on her condition in  case of any anomalies", he qualified carefully.</P>
<P>"I sense a <I>but</I> to this conversation", remarked Janeway dryly.</P>
<P>"There’s a massive ‘but’, Captain", the Doctor cautioned, his tone deadly  serious. "I have no idea how this is going to affect her psychologically. The  neurological stress she underwent has never been analysed before. More to the  point, my deficiencies as a psychologist are well documented." He displayed a  delicate moue of disgust at the memory of his abortive attempts to help Seven  cope with an alleged assault many months ago.</P>
<P>"Doctor, all I can ask is that you do your best." Janeway replied. "I’ll make  sure its duly noted amongst the senior staff so that they can report any worries  to you, if they so wish." Janeway stared at the sickbay doors, her eyes slightly  unfocused as she imagined her Chief Engineer returning to her quarters. "Let’s  just hope that we’re worrying over nothing".</P>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<P>Loping easily through the corridor towards her quarters, B’Elanna mused on  what had happened. She wanted nothing more than to discuss the procedure with  Seven but was disinclined to disturb her from her regeneration cycle. Suddenly  the diminutive klingon skidded to a halt, a dread feeling surging through her.  What if Seven had decided to explore her new feelings with Paris? B’Elanna  closed her eyes in a futile attempt to block that image but her curiosity  remained unchecked and she found herself asking the computer for Seven’s  location.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is in Lieutenant Paris’ quarters", the computer stated  crisply. B’Elanna convulsively clenched her fists for an instant before resuming  her journey to her own quarters, wondering if it was now too late to ever tell  Seven of the feelings she had for her.</P>
<P>Once inside, B’Elanna decided to treat herself to a shower with real water,  splurging some of her stockpiled replicator rations. Setting the water  temperature as high as she could tolerate, the engineer stood underneath the  jets of water for some time, relishing the tingling as the water practically  scalded her caramel skin. Thoroughly soaked, she concentrated on washing her  hair first, working up a lather as she massaged her scalp before rinsing the  bubbles away, feeling them creep slowly down her back before waves of water  hurtled them down more rapidly. As her fingers brushed past the cortical  monitor, she belatedly questioned the device’s water resistance and contemplated  removing it until she finished. There was something reassuring about its  presence though, so she decided to leave it in place in the hope that Starfleet  had considered the possibility of the thing getting wet.</p>
<P>She selected some soapstone to attend her skin with, its abrasive quality  scraping away the top layer as she worked it over her body with her hands,  rubbing the soap in with small circular motions. She speculated whether her  actions could be analysed for some hidden psychological meaning of ritual  cleansing but pushed the thoughts away, not wanting an answer. As she finished  rinsing, she heard the chime of her door. She considered ignoring the entry  request but curiosity got the better of her. Grabbing the thick, black bathrobe  that hung on the bathroom door, she shrugged it on; wrapping the material around  her wet skin and hurriedly tying the belt tightly round her as she approached  the door, choosing to open it in person.</P>
<P>"Seven", she exclaimed, as the doors revealed the identity of her visitor.  "Come in", she stammered, standing to one side to allow the tall blonde woman  admission.</P>
<P>Seven looked at B’Elanna briefly before entering, feeling her heart hammer in  her chest as she took in the beauty of the woman, admiring the strong legs and  the brief glimpse of her chest as the engineer’s robe shifted slightly in her  move to allow Seven entrance to her quarters.</P>
<P>On her way to the Chief Engineer’s quarters, Seven had decided determinedly  to tell B’Elanna of her feelings. Now she stood in the middle of her living  area, watching as B’Elanna wedged herself into the corner of a sofa, hugging her  knees and her resolution seemed to disintegrate, leaving her with a dread  feeling of self-doubt and anxiety.</P>
<P>"You can sit if you want to", invited B’Elanna, breaking into the sudden  turmoil of thoughts that raced through the Seven’s mind. Automatically, she sat  down, her back rigidly straight as she looked at the dark engineer.</P>
<P>"I came to see that you were recovered from your ordeal", Seven began,  licking her lips nervously before continuing. "And to apologise for not  attending sickbay. I was still asleep".</P>
<P>B’Elanna flinched inwardly, knowing where Seven had been asleep, but she  recognised the ex-drone’s concern. "Seven, there’s no need to apologise. You’ve  been through a massive ordeal yourself." She ran a hand absently through her wet  hair, trying to keep the thick tresses under some sort of control as it dried  naturally and was surprised to see Seven lean forward and scrutinise her  closely.</p>
<P>"You’re wearing a cortical monitor", the borg stated, alarm coursing through  her body.</P>
<P>"It’s so the Doc could release me from sickbay. He knows how much I hate it  in there." B’Elanna tried to play down its significance but felt a small thrill  at Seven’s concern.</P>
<P>"I am sorry B’Elanna", the young blonde woman said again, her body slouching  back into the chair. "I should never have asked you to do this for me."</P>
<P>"Don’t start down the road of guilt", B’Elanna warned quickly. "I wanted to  do this. I wanted to do it for a friend." Seven’s head snapped up to look at  B’Elanna again. The klingon swallowed briefly before continuing. "You haven’t  told me yet if it was a success."</P>
<P>Seven looked at her in confusion. "The bio-neural circuitry has been  integrated effectively."</P>
<P>"That’s not what I meant". The dark engineer sighed, not wanting to hear the  next answer but paradoxically needing to know if her efforts had been worth the  trouble. "Have your emotions become un-restricted?"</P>
<P>Seven sat and stared at her companion for a long moment as she tried to  formulate her answer.</P>
<P>"I do not know", she eventually answered.</P>
<P>"Oh, come on Seven. You were in Tom’s quarters all night", blurted B’Elanna  unthinkingly.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes narrowed slightly and she felt a secret thrill that B’Elanna had  bothered to find out her whereabouts.</P>
<P>"I was in Tom’s quarters all night asleep", Seven amended quietly. "I was  exhausted after the procedure and fell asleep on his bed." She looked for any  reaction on the klingon’s face as she finished. "He slept on the couch outside",  and felt certain that she saw a glimmer of relief drift across the expressive  engineer’s visage.</P>
<P>B’Elanna hugged her knees in tight, her desires warring with her honour. It  wasn’t fair to tell Seven of her feelings when her own emotions had just been  unleashed, particularly when she was involved with someone else but she longed  to share those new emotions with her and experience them together.</P>
<P>Seven noticed the shift in mood and decided that now was the time to own up  to B’Elanna about her feelings. She couldn’t shake the dread feeling that she  might be rejected but she wanted to share her newly unleashed emotions with  B’Elanna. She wanted B’Elanna to be the one to free her innermost desires and to  experience complete depth of emotion with the passionate klingon.</P>
<P>"Seven, I have to tell you something", B’Elanna began determinedly but found  herself hesitating. She cursed herself inwardly for the frightened Tikka cat  that she was.</P>
<P>Seven stood up abruptly and used the hesitation to her advantage. "B’Elanna,  I need to talk to you to, but it is difficult for me to find the right  words."</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s mind reeled at the endless roads that Seven could be going  down.</P>
<P>"Let me go first, it’s important", she pleaded, staring beseechingly at the  pacing ex-drone.</P>
<P>Seven was suddenly alarmed at B’Elanna’s speach. She feared that the  raven-haired klingon had guessed her intentions and was going to thwart her  admission. "No, this is something that I must tell you", she retorted, clasping  her hands behind her back and turning away from B’Elanna, irrationally  frightened by what she was about to say.</P>
<P>B’Elanna stood up in frustration. It was difficult enough to broach the  subject without having to play verbal ping-pong beforehand.</P>
<P>"Seven", she began again, taking a pace toward the blonde Astrometrics  officer.</P>
<P>Seven spun round, determined to voice her thoughts first, so they both saw  shock mirrored in their faces as they simultaneously told each other;</P>
<P>"I love you."</P>
