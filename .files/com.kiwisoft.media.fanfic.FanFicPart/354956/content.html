<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 23: Wagons -->

<p>"Are you sure you'll be okay?" Rebecca asked. Josie
		looked down at her from atop Phoenix. Her toe throbbed within the black leather boot.
		Sleeping the night without blankets to protect from the desert chill didn't help.</p>

		<p>"I'll be fine, Rebecca. The river should only be a few hours
		away, and a town not much further than that." She handed over one of her colts.
		"Just in case. Don't hurt yourself with it."</p>

		<p>Rebecca took the steel weapon. Her fingertips rolled over the
		pearl handle. "How long do you think you'll be gone?" she asked quietly, trying
		not to let her fear show.</p>

		<p>"No more than two days. I'll get the pins for the wagon and
		then I'll be back." She adjusted the fit of her Winchester in its sheath before
		realizing that she was stalling. "Be careful," Josie said gruffly before kicking
		Phoenix into a gallop, taking her away from her young friend. Rebecca watched her ride
		away in a billowing cloud of dust.</p>

		<p>"You too, Josie," she said softly. She thought about
		what the bounty hunter had said about the river being only a few hours away. Surely Josie
		wouldn't mind if she went and washed their clothes and blankets? Smiling to herself at the
		idea, Rebecca looked for something with which to hold the remainder of the soap.</p>

		<p>As expected, the edge of the river appeared within three hours.
		Josie gratefully dumped out the remainder of the stale water from her canteen and filled
		it with the cool water from the Rio Grande. After a refreshing soak of her head, the
		gunslinger ate some jerky and then mounted up and continued on her way. She wanted to get
		the pin and get back as soon as possible. The constant bumping against the saddle
		continued to remind Josie of her trip sideways on the wagon bench.</p>

		<p>It was a sweat-soaked Rebecca that reached the same spot on the
		river that Josie had visited hours earlier. With no saddle, the young woman was forced to
		lay all the clothes across the back of the horse and carry the sack that contained the
		soap and the washboard in one hand and the reins in the other. Flossy went right to the
		edge of the water and nickered contentedly as she drew the cool liquid into her mouth.
		Rebecca removed her boots and stepped into the water, letting the cool mud slip between
		her toes as the water soothed her aching and hot feet. She let out a sigh of relief and
		flopped down into the water, giggling slightly. Only after a refreshing swim did she begin
		her chore. It was late afternoon before Rebecca returned to where the wagon and the rest
		of their goods were. The length of time required for accomplishing the task had just as
		much to do with her constant swim breaks as with the stubbornness of the coal oil within
		the clothes. Once back at camp she draped the clothing and blankets over the sides of the
		wagon and nearby bushes figuring it would be dry by nightfall.</p>

		<p>As night settled on the land, two women laid awake staring at the
		stars above. Rebecca snuggled under her now clean blanket using the gunslinger's blanket
		as a pillow. Josie rested her head against her saddle with Phoenix's saddle blanket
		covering her. The last waking thoughts that both women had were of each other, both
		silently hoping the other was safe and well.</p>

		<p>The sun was high the next day when Josie found a small ranch. The
		clinking and clanging of metal against metal filled her ears as she headed to a large
		barn. All the doors were open in a feeble attempt to disperse the heat from the roaring
		fire. A large, burly man swung a hammer again and again, striking a horseshoe braced
		against the anvil. His face was covered with sweat and soot, matching his black leather
		apron. "You a cartwright?" she asked as she stepped into the doorway.</p>

		<p>He never looked up from his work, apparently unaffected by a
		strange woman showing up at his ranch. "Cartwright, smith, whatever needs being done,
		I guess," he said in a deep voice that matched his build. Josie guessed that he could
		easily lift a small horse.</p>

		<p>"I need cotter pins," she said as she stepped closer,
		stopping a couple of feet from him. She did her best not to limp and was grateful that he
		didn't look up. He stopped pounding the shoe and looked up at her. "Over there,"
		he said, pointing to a small box sitting on a nearby bench. "Find the ones ya need;
		the damn wagons are all different."</p>

		<p>It took several minutes for Josie to find four cotter pins that
		would fit the axles on the wagon. She'd be damned if she was going to buy one, go back,
		and discover that another one was rusted. A quick mental check of her funds allowed her to
		grab a few more, just in case. "Six bits," he said when she showed him the pins.
		Josie put the coins on the bench and headed for the door, again trying not to allow the
		pain in her toe to affect her gait. She stopped and turned around, her eyes catching a
		large expanse of sheepskin hanging on the wall. Her thoughts immediately went from the
		pain in her foot to a pain somewhere else.</p>

		<p>Rebecca drank the last of her coffee and stared up at the night
		sky. She was proud of how clean she had gotten the clothes and blankets. She used several
		rags to try and clean up the soapy, flammable mixture from the rest of the items and was
		pleased with the amount of progress she had made. Almost all the rest of the belongings
		were clean and only the sacks of sugar, salt, and flour had to be discarded. Thankfully,
		the jerky and the rest of their staples had been spared from damage. The fire burned low,
		the night warm enough not to require much more. She settled in under her blanket and
		stared at the stars. Like the night before, she worried about her friend and prayed for
		her safety and quick return. As also done the night before, Josie was several miles off,
		tucked under the sheepskin and wishing for the same thing.</p>

		<p>It was mid-afternoon when Josie returned to the damaged wagon and
		her friend. Rebecca let out a yelp of joy and ran over to her, stopping just short and
		regaining her composure. "How are you?" she said simply, her hand covering her
		eye to block out the sun as she looked up at the tall gunslinger sitting atop the equally
		tall steed.</p>

		<p>"Fine," Josie answered as she dismounted, making sure
		her right foot hit the ground first to minimize the jolt to her injured left one. She
		smiled slightly, happy to see that Rebecca was fine. Her eyes settled on the neat pile of
		folded clothes and neatly packed piles of supplies. "Rebecca... you cleaned up
		everything?"</p>

		<p>"Well, most everything. I couldn't clean the sugar, salt, or
		flour, but most all the rest I was able to save."</p>

		<p>"Where did you get the water?" Josie asked. Her eyes
		narrowed when the answer came to her. "Rebecca, did you go all the way to the
		river?"</p>

		<p>She took a step back before answering the gunslinger.
		"Well...yeah. I took Flossy with me," she decided not to mention that she had
		left the gun with the wagon. Josie walked slowly over to the pile of clothes and blankets.
		Her hand glided over the material as a smile came to her lips. She held her spare shirt to
		her nose and inhaled with only the scent of lye touching her nose. "You did a good
		job, Rebecca," she said. The smile that came to the young woman's face reminded Josie
		of a child getting exactly what they wanted for their birthday. She walked over and tended
		to Phoenix, tossing the sheepskin on the bench of the wagon as she passed.</p>

		<p>"What's that for? Oh," she chuckled. "What's the
		matter, Josie? Don't like the way the bench bites?" She was rewarded with an arched
		eyebrow before Josie rolled her eyes and shook her head. The pair shared a pleasant
		evening and slept peacefully knowing the other was just on the other side of the fire.
		</p>

		<p>Josie uttered yet another curse as the board slid off of the
		stone when she tried to use it as a lever to lift the wagon. "We need
		something...wider," she said, looking around for something to fit the need.</p>

		<p>"Josie, this is the widest stone we could find out here in
		the middle of nowhere," Rebecca muttered as she wiped the sweat off her brow.
		"Are you sure there's no other way to do this?"</p>

		<p>"What do you want me to do, Rebecca? Climb under the wagon
		and lift it with my back?" she growled. Three hours of no progress had brought her
		foul mood out. Every time she got enough weight down to move the wagon upward the board
		would shift off of the curved stone. None of their supplies could take the strain of
		holding the weight. She looked down at the wheel stuck under the wagon again and cursed.
		"You know all these ranches with the wagon wheels out front? Well, they didn't settle
		because they liked the area. That's where their damned wagon broke down!" Josie
		growled and smacked her hand against the side of the wagon as she walked around looking
		once again at their belongings.</p>

		<p>"Want a broken hand to go with the toe?" Rebecca
		mumbled as she repositioned the stone and board. Josie appeared next to her and knelt
		down, holding the cracked barrel that once held the coal oil.</p>

		<p>"I heard that, Rebecca," she said as she placed the
		barrel under the board. "Let's try this again."</p>

		<p>With much grunting and straining, Josie managed to force the
		corner of the wagon up enough for Rebecca to pull the wheel out from under it. It wasn't
		high enough for her to fit it to the axle, however. Without thinking, the young woman
		ducked her shoulder under the corner and pushed up with her legs, helping lift it the
		final inch or so that was needed to place the wheel on. Josie pressed down on the board
		with all her might to try and ease the weight on Rebecca's shoulder as she moved the wheel
		into place. She slipped out from under the wagon and pushed the pin in as far as she could
		by hand. "Okay!"</p>

		<p>Josie eased the wagon back down, cautiously watching the wheel
		for signs of it coming back off. Once lowered, she moved over and used the butt of her
		revolver to pound the pin in the rest of the way before twisting it into place.
		"Whew," she wiped the sweat off of her face with the remains of her torn
		bandanna. She had hoped that fixing the wagon would be a quick process and they could be
		on their way early, but now decided that a leisurely break was in order before loading up
		the wagon. It was nightfall before they reached the river and decided to call it a night.
