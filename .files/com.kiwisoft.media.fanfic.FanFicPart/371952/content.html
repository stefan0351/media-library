<P><B>Chapter Two: Lily In The Sky With Diamonds</B></P><P>Miley sat by her piano, pressing random keys, making a little tune, humming along and thinking about Lily. Her mind was in two different places. <I>'Tell her!' </I>one half told her. <I>'It will mess everything up if you do...'</I> the other was arguing. She shook her head in frustration.<p>"I just need to get her off of my mind!"</P><P>She opened the sheet music in front of her, pushing Lily to the side of her mind. She looked at the music and began playing. It was one of her favorite Beatles songs: '<I>Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds'</I>. She sang.</P><P>"Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly. A girl with kaleidoscope eyes..."</P><P>Miley paused and smiled.</P><P>"Cellophane flowers of yellow and green towering over your head."</P><P>Lily came through the kitchen door as Miley was playing. She didn't move or say anything. Just listened. She could listen to Miley forever.<p>"Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone..."</P><P>Lily smiled.</P><P>"Lily in the sky with diamonds," Miley sang.</P><P>Her mouth dropped open as Miley sang it again. Was she hearing this wrong? Was this a mistake?</P><P>"Lily in the sky with diamonds..." Miley sang for the last time.</P><P>She heard it three times. It was no mistake. Lily's face turned red and she smiled sweetly.</P><P>"Aww," she let out involuntarily.</P><P>Miley froze, eyes wide, realizing what she's just done. She turned around.</P><P>"Lily!" She was nervous. "You didn't happen to um...hear that...did you?"<p>She nodded, still smiling, looking like she was desperately holding in another 'aww'.</P><P>Miley immediately felt sick.</P><P>"I'm sorry! I didn't mean to...well I didn't mean for you to hear it. I mean-"<p>"Miley!" Lily said loudly over the rambling voice. She walked over to the piano, grabbed her best friend's hands and made her stand. She didn't let go. She could tell that Miley was extremely upset over this. Lily squeezed her hands in reassurance.</P><P>"Please don't be mad at me..."<p>"Mad? Miley, no. I'm not mad. I could never be mad. That was the sweetest thing I've ever heard," she said glancing over at the piano. "I mean, it's not like I haven't placed your name in songs before..." she said without thinking.</P><P>Miley looked up at her, a little startled.</P><P>"I...mean..." Lily started, trying to cover her last statement up. She was now nervous herself.</P><P>"You have?" Miley asked, blushing.</P><P>"Yeah." Lily said bluntly, but softly. "I have."</P><P>They stood there for a moment in silence.<p>"Miley, I like you."</P><P>She paused.</P><P>"A lot..."</P><P>"Aww," Miley let out. "I like you too... A lot."<p>Lily, being a little more brave than Miley, leaned in and kissed her lightly on the lips.</P><P>Oliver, with his impeccable timing, came rushing through the door, seconds before the girls broke apart.<P>"Awww," he gushed.</P><P>Miley observed Lily's goosebumps on her arms and smiled before looking at her own.</P><P>"You know Miley, I hate to say it,"</P><P>"Then don't," she interrupted, a bit annoyed. "I definitely fell for the right friend."</P><P>Lily's face, however impossible it seemed, turned even more red.</P><P>"Me too."</P><P>_<BR><B>I hope you enjoyed<BR>this little story. (:<BR></B></P>
