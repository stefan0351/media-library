<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 41: Betrayal -->

<p>Rebecca?s father sat at a table in the saloon by a window
		that commanded a view of the Mercantile that also served as the post office for Tahlequah,
		Oklahoma. One hand tightly grasped the bottle of bourbon that had been his constant
		companion since his arrival in town three days ago, and the other methodically creased a
		piece of paper until it threatened to fall apart. It didn?t matter; he knew every
		word on that paper by heart. It was a letter that read:</p>

		<p style="margin-left:2cm">Dear Katie</p>

		<p style="margin-left:2cm">I wanted to write and let you know that I am well. I am traveling
		with Josie Hunter ? yes, the outlaw we used to read books about. But believe me, she
		is nothing like those books make her out to be. She can be very kind and caring, and I
		have seen her risk her life many times to help others, including me. I can?t tell you
		how many times she has saved my life, and I refuse to believe that such a person is guilty
		of all the crimes she has been accused of. One day I hope to help her clear her name; it
		is the least I can do for all she has done for me.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2cm">She is taking me to Tahlequah Oklahoma to meet a real Medicine
		elder. I want to learn the healing arts, and the Cherokee?s, who are her
		father?s people, are very skilled in that area. We hope to be there in another two
		weeks or so, and I would love it if you would write to let me know how you are doing - you
		know what I mean. I will check the general delivery when we arrive in town, and as often
		as possible after that until I hear from you. Please don?t mention this letter to Ma,
		as I am afraid she will say something to Pa, and I don?t want him to know I am with
		Josie. He would not understand, and I am afraid he might try to do something to get me
		back. And much as I love you and Ma, Katie, I can never live under a roof with him again.
		I just pray that he does not hurt you like he hurt me, and hope you find yourself a nice
		fellow that will treat you with the kindness and gentleness you deserve; like Josie treats
		me, even though she is a woman.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2cm">I love you, little sis. Be well</p>
		<p style="margin-left:2cm">Rebecca</p>

		<p>Caleb gritted his teeth and poured another slug of whiskey into
		his glass. He could just picture how that bitch was treating Rebecca with "kindness
		and gentleness", and the image made his blood boil. He had heard about women who kept
		after other women, and they were an abomination in the eyes of the lord. He planned to
		drag Rebecca back to Chancetown ? bound and gagged, if need be, but not before he
		collected the reward on the head of Josie Hunter. He smiled at the good fortune that
		caused him to go into town to collect the letter that was intended for his daughter.
		Normally the girl would run errands in town while he sat in the bar drinking up what
		little profits he was able to eke out of running the farm. But both Katie and Sarah were
		down with the flu when Caleb ran out of liquor, which was about the only thing he went to
		town for these days. At Sarah?s request he stopped in the mercantile to pick up a few
		items, and the proprietor had handed him the letter for Katie, knowing he was her father.
		From the moment he read it, he knew what he had to do. Within a couple of days he was on
		his way to Oklahoma, already planning how he would spend the thousand-dollar reward.</p>

		<p>"Wait, wait, stop!" Rebecca called as their wagon
		rumbled almost past the mercantile. Josie reined in the horse thinking that Rebecca had
		seen something in the road that she was about to run over.</p>

		<p>"What is it?" She asked, her eyes scouring the area in
		front of the wagon for the source of Rebecca?s excitement.</p>

		<p>"Oh, sorry?I didn?t mean to make you think
		something was wrong. I just need to stop into the mercantile for something. Can you wait a
		minute?"</p>

		<p>"Actually I need to pick up some grain at the feed store.
		You go ahead and shop and I?ll come back for you in a little while."</p>

		<p>"Okay," Rebecca said brightly, jumping down from the
		wagon and hurrying into the store. Josie gave the reins a jingle and Flossy trudged down
		the road.</p>

		<p>Caleb almost didn?t recognize Rebecca; she seemed taller,
		healthier, and more robust than the girl he remembered. Living on the road seemed to suit
		her; or perhaps it was the attentions of the outlaw that caused her to look so content.
		His nostrils flared as he visualized the two women together, and in spite of his firm
		belief that what they were doing was a mortal sin, he could feel himself growing aroused
		at the mental image. He got unsteadily to his feet; he had been drinking almost steadily
		for several days, and even he had a limit. Holding his hat in front of the erection he
		could not quite will away, he lurched out the door and across the street, praying that the
		outlaw would not show up too soon and spoil his plans.</p>

		<p>"I?m looking for a letter addressed to Rebecca Cameron
		care of general delivery," she was saying to the gray-headed woman behind the
		counter. The woman smiled and turned toward a stack of mail behind her in a wooden box.</p>

		<p>"I sure don?t recall anything with that name on
		it," the woman said over her shoulder, "and I usually remember when I get
		something for a name that?s not familiar."</p>

		<p>"Don?t waste your time," Caleb growled from behind
		Rebecca, causing the young woman to jump and turn toward him. Involuntarily she brought
		her hands up to shield her face before she realized he was not going to strike her. Not at
		that moment, anyway. "There ain?t gonna be no mail there for little Rebecca,
		?cause little Katie never got her letter." He wagged the grimy creased paper in
		front of Rebecca?s face.</p>

		<p>"P-Pa," she stammered, "What are you
		doing?"</p>

		<p>"Never mind," he said, cutting her off in mid sentence.
		He grasped her arm with a grip like a steel band, and began to propel her across the floor
		toward the door. The hapless clerk behind the counter looked on, uncertain what to do.
		Clearly this was a domestic quarrel of some kind and she would do well to keep her nose
		out of it, her husband would say. "There?s gonna be a tall half-breed iron
		totin? woman coming in here looking for this little gal. When she does, tell her that
		Rebecca will meet her down to the sheriff?s office. And don?t mention that you
		seen anyone with her, or I?ll make you right sorry you did."</p>

		<p>"I?I?" The woman began, but before she could
		form a sentence, the pair were out the door.</p>

		<p>Josie could not imagine what possible errand had taken Rebecca to
		the sheriff?s office. The woman in the mercantile said only that she was to meet her
		there. She opened the door to the office and spotted Rebecca sitting in a chair with an
		older man beside her. His hands were placed possessively on Rebecca?s shoulders, and
		Josie instinctively began to grab for her gun. At that same moment, Rebecca called out
		"Josie, don?t?" And a gun butt caught her at the base of her skull,
		causing her to sink lifelessly to the floor.</p>

		<p>When she regained consciousness she was lying in a cell on a cot
		that reeked of urine and god knew what else. Her head pounded, and her exploring fingers
		found a substantial goose egg on her head. The fingers came away sticky with blood, but at
		least the bleeding had stopped. Gingerly she sat up and tried to focus on what was going
		on in the outer office. She could not see anyone, but she could hear voices, one of them
		Rebecca?s.</p>

		<p>"?go of me! If you?ve hurt her, I
		swear?"</p>

		<p>"Simmer down," said a male voice with a youthful tone
		to it, probably belonging to the sheriff. "I just knocked her out to keep her from
		killing your father. She?ll be all right." Definitely the sheriff then; the man
		standing with Rebecca had not been wearing a star? Suddenly it registered on Josie
		that the sheriff had said the older man was Rebecca?s father. The man who had beaten
		his daughter so bad she felt running away with a known outlaw was preferable to staying in
		his home. The man she had once vowed to kill if she ever found herself in the same place
		as him. Her face flushed with anger as she listened to the words that spewed forth from
		the abusive drunk.</p>

		<p>"Shoulda killed her, sheriff. Reward?s good dead or
		alive, and dead is a lot safer with that one. Mean as a snake, she is. And corrupted my
		daughter to boot. She ain?t hardly fitten for marriage no more. I?ll end up
		havin? to support the lazy?"</p>

		<p>"Take your hands off me!" Rebecca?s voice broke
		into her father?s venomous diatribe. Josie?s frustration at not being able to
		see what was taking place in the office and intervene doubled with each moment. She paced
		in her tiny cell, her eyes searching for a chink in the stone so she could dig her way
		out, or a loose bar that she could pry free and use to?what, she thought bitterly.
		Bludgeon that snake to death? Not likely he would get within arms reach of her, and
		certainly the sheriff would do more than hit her on the head if she did what she truly
		wanted to do. Killing for the sake of killing was not her way. She had killed countless
		men, but only those who would have killed her if she had not. Or those who threatened to
		do harm to someone she cared about. She knew she could kill Rebecca?s father in a
		heartbeat and feel no remorse whatsoever. She was surprised to feel tears running down her
		face, tears that sprung from her fear of what would become of the woman she loved when
		they hung her. And she had no doubt at all that they would hang her, and this time there
		would be no bumbling lynch mob walking away without first making sure she was dead. Her
		thoughts were interrupted once again by the voices outside her range of vision.</p>

		<p>"Mr. Cameron, I?ve got another empty cell right next to
		Josie I can put you in if you don?t leave this young woman alone."</p>

		<p>"She?s my daughter. I have the right?"</p>

		<p>"You have no rights!" Rebecca?s voice rose in
		anger. "Whatever rights you had you gave away when you beat me. A father should never
		hurt his children. A father?" Her voice trailed off, and Josie?s heart
		broke as she heard Rebecca begin to sob. ?Oh, sprite, don?t let him hurt you
		anymore,? she prayed.</p>

		<p>"All right, that?s it Mr. Cameron. You take yourself on
		out of here and sober up. If I catch you bothering your daughter again I promise I will
		lock you up. Those cells are pretty small and close together and I can?t be watching
		Josie every minute, if you get my meaning." Josie found herself admiring this man who
		had clubbed her on the head. In other circumstances she was sure they could have been
		friends. But at least she did not need to worry quite so much about Rebecca while she was
		in Tahlequah, as the sheriff would protect her.</p>

		<p>"But my reward," Caleb whined, but the sheriff cut him
		off.</p>

		<p>"You?ll get your reward when they ship her back to the
		states," the sheriff replied. "I looked into it when you told me a few days ago
		she was coming to town, and Miss Hunter is not wanted for any crimes in Oklahoma
		Territory. Circuit judge will be here next week and will decide whether to send her back
		to the states or not, and you can whine at him about your reward. I?m sick of
		listening to you. Now move on." Josie could hear some mumbling which she assumed was
		Rebecca?s father protesting, but a moment later she heard the door slam and it was
		quiet in the office. Josie heaved a sigh and sat back down on the sagging bunk.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, sheriff. I?m grateful for your help,"
		Rebecca said sincerely. "Can I see Josie now?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, Miss Cameron. Follow me." A few moments later
		the sheriff rounded the corner leading into the area where the cells were located with
		Rebecca a few paces behind him. Josie stood and walked to the front of the cell and
		extended her hands through the bars. Rebecca elbowed past the sheriff and ran to the cell,
		grasping both of Josie?s hands and kissing her quickly on the cheek.</p>

		<p>The sheriff turned to walk out of the room. "Sheriff,
		wait," Josie called to him and he turned around. "Thanks. For taking care of
		Rebecca." Now that she could see him, she understood why she had felt an affinity for
		the man. He had the look of a Cherokee. Unless she missed her guess he was a half-breed
		like herself. And the Cherokee?s took care of their own.</p>

		<p>"No problem," he said with a grin. "I?m just
		sorry I had to club you on the head when I did, but I was afraid you were going to shoot
		him. The man?s an ass, but I couldn?t let that happen. And you can believe that
		no harm will come to Miss Cameron while she?s in my town."</p>

		<p>"I believe you. And I?m sorry you had to club me, too.
		My head hurts like hell." He shrugged as if to say, "what could I do?", and
		she couldn?t help but smile at him. "Do you suppose we could have some privacy
		here?" She asked, and he nodded.</p>

		<p>"I?ll be in the office if you need anything," he
		said, then he turned and left the room.</p>

		<p>Both women stood there for several moments after he left, not
		speaking, their fingers twined together through the bars. Then both of them began to speak
		at the same instant.</p>

		<p>"Let me see?"</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, how?"</p>

		<p>"?your head. Turn around and let me see." Josie
		did as she asked, and Rebecca gasped at the size of the bump on her head.</p>

		<p>"I?ll be all right," Josie said turning back
		around to see the look of horror on Rebecca?s face. "It?s stopped bleeding
		already. Don?t worry. Rebecca, how did he find us?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca?s lip trembled and she looked as if she might burst
		into tears. Josie reached out through the bars and caressed her cheek, crooning softly as
		she did. "Shhh, baby, it?s all right. Don?t cry." Rather than
		comforting her, Josie?s words seemed to push Rebecca over the edge. Tears began to
		course down her face, and when she tried to speak her voice came out in ragged gasps.</p>

		<p>"I-I?wrote?to my s-sister," she sobbed.
		"I told her where we were g-going. I just wanted to know?she was all right, and
		to let her know I was happy. Oh, Josie, I never thought he would pick up the mail. He
		never does. I?m so sorry, Josie?"</p>

		<p>It had never occurred to Josie that Rebecca had betrayed her,
		however innocent her motives had been, and for a moment she was shocked into silence. The
		look of agony on Rebecca?s face pierced straight into the outlaw?s heart and
		pulled her from her silent contemplation. Once again she reached out to comfort the woman
		she loved, and Rebecca seized her hand. Josie smiled and kissed the back of Rebecca?s
		hand.</p>

		<p>"Don?t blame yourself," Josie said softly.
		"You meant no harm."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Josie, what are we going to do? If they send you back
		to the states, they?ll hang you. I couldn?t live with myself if that happened. I
		don?t want to live without you?"</p>

		<p>"Don?t talk like that," Josie said more harshly
		than she had intended, and Rebecca fell silent and simply stared at her. "If
		something?if they do send me back, I want you to promise you?ll go to
		Charles? place. You?ll be safe there, and he and Horace love you."</p>

		<p>"I?m not leaving you," Rebecca said firmly.
		"If they send you back, I?m going to be right beside you. You can?t bully
		me, Josie Hunter. I?m in this till the end."</p>

		<p>Josie could tell from the set of her jaw that there would be no
		arguing with the younger woman. Her one hope for getting out of this mess without a pine
		box for a bed would be if they could convince the judge not to extradite her. And
		Rebecca?s gift with words might just be the thing that would do the trick.
		"You?re a stubborn woman, Rebecca Cameron. And by God, that might be just what
		we need." She reached through the bars and put her hand behind Rebecca?s head,
		pulling her in for a kiss.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>It was several hours later when Rebecca emerged from the
		cellblock. Josie?s headache had worsened while they were talking and she thought if
		she could get some sleep it might help. Almost as soon as she laid her head down she was
		asleep. Rebecca watched her sleep for several minutes before she tore herself away,
		knowing that there were many things to do before the judge arrived and nobody to do it but
		herself.</p>

		<p>The sheriff was not in the office when she came out and instead a
		deputy sat behind the desk. He barely glanced at her as he was busy cleaning guns. It
		reminded her of the evenings she and Josie spent while the outlaw did that same thing, and
		she felt a gripping in her chest like a vice around her heart.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me," she said to the deputy, who finally looked
		up from his labors and blinked a couple of times to find a beautiful young woman standing
		before him. "I wonder if you can tell me where the sheriff has gone?"</p>

		<p>"Uh, yes ma?am," he said, tipping his hat in
		respect. "He?s gone off to get himself a bite to eat. Should be back directly,
		or you can find him over to Miss Lucy?s diner. He?ll be bringing something back
		for your?for the prisoner to eat."</p>

		<p>"Thanks," she said with a smile. "I better go help
		him with his food choices for Josie. She?s?particular."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma?am," he said with a nod, and resumed
		cleaning the weapons.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The sheriff saw her walk through the door, and from the way her
		eyes were searching the crowd, he figured she was looking for him. He stood up and waved
		to catch her eye, and she smiled and walked toward him. He remained standing as she
		approached, pulling out the chair opposite his. "I?d be honored if you would
		join me," he said sincerely. Rebecca had been so concerned over Josie that she had
		not even realized how long it had been since she had eaten. She was indeed quite hungry,
		and her stomach growled loudly as he finished speaking.</p>

		<p>"I?thank you again, sheriff. You are very kind. I
		believe I will." She allowed him to scoot her chair under the table and then he went
		to fetch the waitress before resuming his seat.</p>

		<p>"She?ll be right here, Miss Cameron."</p>

		<p>"Call me Rebecca, please. Just now I?m not so crazy
		about the name Cameron."</p>

		<p>"All right, Miss?Rebecca," he said catching
		himself and smiling sheepishly. "I?m John Kenwood. I?d be pleased if
		you?d call me John." The waitress appeared by Rebecca?s side and ran down
		the list of specials available, adding that the roast beef was some of the best in the
		entire territory.</p>

		<p>"That sounds good," Rebecca said with enthusiasm.</p>

		<p>"And put together a plate of that for us to take with
		us," John added, then quickly turned to Rebecca and asked, "That is if you think
		that will meet with Josie?s approval."</p>

		<p>"Oh it?ll meet with her approval all right. We?re
		used to eating what we can catch on the road, and beef is a rare treat." The waitress
		withdrew to give the orders to the cook, and for the first time Rebecca noticed that
		John?s own plate of food was sitting, cooling, on the table in front of him.
		"Please, John, eat your food while it?s still hot."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I don?t mind eating my food cold. Tell you the
		truth, I probably prefer it. I?ll just wait until she brings your food. Maybe you can
		tell me a bit about how you came to be traveling with the notorious outlaw Josie Hunter
		while we wait."</p>

		<p>Rebecca had sensed from her first meeting with the gentle sheriff
		that he was a man she could trust. She folded her hands on the table in front of her and
		began her story. "It all started when I was grabbed by three thugs intent on raping
		me. But they didn?t reckon on Josie Hunter being within hearing range of my
		screams?"</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca pushed her plate away and politely declined the
		waitress? offer of another cup of coffee. She felt as if she would burst if she took
		in another morsel. While they ate, she had summed up the high points of her life with
		Josie, highlighting the number of times the outlaw had saved her life. The only detail she
		left out was the fact that she and Josie had become lovers. She did not think that such a
		personal detail had any bearing on their current problem, which was how to avoid letting
		Josie be extradited for trial in the states.</p>

		<p>When Rebecca was through with her story, John sat there for a few
		moments deep in thought. Taking a deep breath, he said, "I sure wish it was up to me
		whether Josie were to stand trial or not. She?d be sitting here with us right now,
		laughing and drinking coffee." Rebecca glanced toward the empty chair on her right,
		and felt a stab of pain that what the sheriff had just described was not the reality of
		the moment. "Josie is something of a?local legend, you might say," John
		continued. "The Cherokee will tell you that she is responsible for saving more lives
		than any other person they can name. The money she stole from the railroads she used to
		buy food and supplies for the Cherokee. According to legend, she never kept any of it for
		herself. She also helped the Chinamen and coloreds the railroads worked half to death for
		slave wages. To the white man she?s a murdering thief, but to anyone with skin other
		than white she is something of a hero. To tell the truth, I was surprised to see her
		traveling with a white woman."</p>

		<p>"I think you should wire the sheriff in Mason?s Gulch
		and see if you can get him to send you a statement about how Josie saved that town from
		being sacked. That was an entire town full of white people Josie saved, and all she asked
		for in return was food for her horse and some salt pork."</p>

		<p>"Hm. Good idea. We?re going to need all the help we can
		get with the judge that?s coming through next week. His family was killed during an
		Indian raid, and he doesn?t look too kindly on anyone with red skin, or even half red
		skin like Josie?s."</p>

		<p>"Can?t we request another judge?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head and said, "I?m afraid not. We only
		have two judges in the area, and the other one is laid up with a broken leg."</p>

		<p>Rebecca lowered her voice and looked intently into the
		sheriff?s face. "I don?t suppose you might?accidentally leave her cell
		unlocked one night."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Miss Rebecca, I?d like nothing more than to see
		her free. But I?m sworn to uphold the law, and that means we have to find a way to
		get her out of there legally." He fell silent when the waitress materialized with a
		basket containing the food for Josie. Handing her several coins, he rose from his chair
		and picked up the basket.</p>

		<p>"I?m sorry, John. Please forget I asked that. I?m
		just?desperate to get her out of there. But we?ll do it your way?according
		to the law. Maybe we can go over the judge?s head and find someone a little more
		sympathetic. Or at least willing to listen to reason."</p>

		<p>The sheriff?s face brightened, and he nodded vigorously.
		"You?re right. That?s exactly what we need to do, and I think I know just
		the man." Holding out his hand to assist Rebecca from her chair, he propelled her
		toward the door, all the while laying out his idea for the next steps to take.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Josie." Rebecca?s soft voice reached into the
		darkness that had enveloped the gunslinger and was pulling her toward the light. The pain
		in her head had lessened, but she still squinted her eyes against the glare of the lantern
		outside the cell. "We brought you some food. And we have a plan." The enthusiasm
		in her voice made Josie open her eyes wider, and she was surprised to see that Rebecca was
		in the cell with her, kneeling on the floor by the cot. The sheriff was nowhere in
		evidence, but she noticed that the cell door was shut behind Rebecca, and presumably
		locked. Her plan probably did not include making a break for it.</p>

		<p>Josie sat up on the edge of the cot and peeked into the basket on
		the floor from which the enticing aroma emanated. "Ah, I see. We?re going to
		blast our way out with?roast beef? Smells heavenly."</p>

		<p>"We are not going to blast our way out. We are going to talk
		our way out, just as you suggested. At least that?s what I am going to try to do. And
		if that fails, we?re going to blast our way out."</p>

		<p>"With roast beef," Josie finished for her. The
		light-hearted tone in Rebecca?s voice was contagious, and Josie found herself
		thinking that perhaps the determined little woman could actually pull it off, whatever her
		clever plan was. "Who is it you?re planning on charming on my behalf?"
		Josie removed the plate from the basket and began to eat as Rebecca told her about the
		judge and his hatred of Indians. As she listened, Josie?s spirits dropped along with
		her appetite, and she set her food aside. "Doesn?t sound like even you could
		charm a man with that much hatred in his heart," Josie said with a hint of bitterness
		in her voice.</p>

		<p>"Oh, but it?s not him I?m going after. John says
		the governor is very sympathetic to the cause of the Indians, and he can override anything
		the judge says as long as we can get him here before you?re sent away. He?s
		supposed to be a fair and honest man, and John thinks that if we tell him how you gave the
		money you stole to the people who should have had it in the first place that?"</p>

		<p>"Wait, wait," she interrupted the little blonde,
		placing her hand on her lips to still her. "What?s this I?m supposed to
		have done with the money, and who is this John who claims to know?"</p>

		<p>"The sheriff?s name is John. Didn?t I tell you
		that? And he said it?s common knowledge that you gave your cut of the robberies to
		the Indians. Why didn?t you tell me? I always kind of wondered why you never seemed
		to have any money since you had stolen so much, but I never would have dreamed
		you?"</p>

		<p>"Common knowledge, is it," Josie said with a wry smile.
		"And I took great pains to try to make sure it was kept secret."</p>

		<p>"Why? Why would you want to hide such a kind and generous
		act?"</p>

		<p>"Think about it. Would you accept a gift from someone
		knowing that what they were giving you was bought with stolen money? Not to mention that
		the more people who knew, the more likely it was the railroads would find out what had
		become of their money. At the very least they would take it back, and possibly even come
		in with guns blazing. I wouldn?t want to be responsible for the death of any of my
		father?s people. Besides, it suited me to have people think that I was no more than a
		ruthless outlaw. Most people pretty much leave me alone when they find out who I am, and
		all evidence to the contrary, I really don?t enjoy being called out and having to
		kill people." She smiled a little sadly and shook her head before continuing,
		"It?s almost funny. I?ve been given credit for so many robberies over the
		years that I would have to have been ten people to do them all. Some of them were in
		places I have never been. I never tried very hard to convince anyone that it wasn?t
		me because it served my purposes. Now they?ll use those crimes against me as well.
		Rebecca, even if you can get to the governor, there is nothing you will be able to tell
		him that will make a difference with that much evidence stacked up against me."</p>

		<p>"I refuse to believe that," Rebecca said stubbornly.
		"I?ll tell him about Mason?s Gulch and Deadwood and all the people you
		saved there."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, a blind person could see that you love me. How
		much weight do you think your testimony is going to carry? They would figure you?d
		lie through your teeth to save me."</p>

		<p>"Yes, I?d lie," Rebecca said through tight lips.
		"I?d do anything I had to if it meant you would go free. But Josie, it?s
		the truth I?ll be telling, and there are plenty of other people who know it too. We
		just have to get hold of them. Tomorrow we?re sending out telegrams to everyone
		you?ve helped and asking them to send in a testimonial for you if they can?t
		come here themselves by next week. Then I?m going to New Hope where the governor will
		be dedicating the new City Hall on Thursday, and I?m going to talk to him. And if I
		can?t convince him, I?ll go higher. As high as I have to. Josie, I won?t
		let them take you?I can?t."</p>

		<p>"The governor is as high as you can get out here in the
		Territories. And I know you will do as much as it?s humanly possible to do. But
		please," she grasped Rebecca?s hand and pulled her into an embrace,
		"don?t get your hopes up too high. And promise me you?ll do what I
		said?about going back to Charles? farm." Rebecca opened her mouth to say
		something but her reply was cut off by the sound of approaching footsteps. By the time
		John appeared in front of the cell they were sitting on opposite ends of the cot, both
		women looking grim but determined.</p>

		<p>"I?m sorry, Miss Rebecca, but I need to lock down the
		prisoner for the night. I?ll have to ask you to leave now." Faced with the
		prospect of separating from Josie, Rebecca?s face looked stricken. Her feet seemed
		weighted down with lead as she rose and crossed the tiny cell.</p>

		<p>Suddenly her eyes lit on the empty cell next to the one Josie
		occupied, and she said to the sheriff, "John, can I stay in the cell next to hers? I
		promise I won?t be a bother."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Rebecca, you don?t want to spend the night in a
		cell," Josie protested. "It?s damp and cold and?"</p>

		<p>"If it?s good enough for you, it?s good enough for
		me," Rebecca said defiantly. She turned to the sheriff and added, "Besides, my
		father is still out there, and I?m afraid he might try to hurt me. I?d feel
		safer if I were in here."</p>

		<p>"Miss Rebecca it?s really not?" The
		sheriff?s refusal was dissipated like mist in the wind by the pleading look in the
		young woman?s face. "All right," he said grudgingly, "but if I should
		have to lock somebody up I?d have to ask you to leave."</p>

		<p>"I understand," she said. "Would it be all right
		if I get my things from the wagon? I?ll only be a minute." Josie?s face
		suddenly looked stricken.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I forgot all about the horses! Flossy has been
		standing in harness for hours, and neither of them have had food or water since this
		morning. I expected to be coming right back to the wagon."</p>

		<p>"Don?t worry. I?ll see that they?re stabled
		and fed," Rebecca said reassuringly. John unlocked the cell and Rebecca hurried out.
		The sooner she attended to the horses the sooner she could be back with Josie. She turned
		and smiled at Josie before she rounded the corner into the outer office, blew the outlaw a
		quick kiss, and was out of sight. The brave smile Josie had been wearing to try to keep
		Rebecca?s spirits up melted from her face, and she sank down onto the cot. With her
		foot she pushed the plate of barely touched food toward the cell door.</p>

		<p>"Might as well take this away. I don?t seem to have
		much of an appetite." John nodded and opened the door, his hand on his gun in case
		Josie should try something while he picked up the plate. She gave a bitter little laugh.
		"Don?t worry, John. I?m not going to do anything. Just promise me
		you?ll keep that sick bastard who calls himself her father away from her, or
		I?ll get out of here ? whatever it takes ? and kill him."</p>
