<!-- The Woman I Love \ Chapter Eight -->

<p>Through the night as the storm fizzled out, Gage, Lacy and the kids fell into a restful sleep. Sometime in the night a drowsy three year old climbed on top of Gage leaving a vacant space between Lacy and the writer which did not remain empty for long as they naturally gravitated toward each other.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As dawn peeked its radiant head, Gage woke from a peaceful sleep. She immediately felt the warmth of Lacy's body curled up against her. Gage stretched, adjusting the small boy lying on her stomach, twisting her body on her side slightly as she turned away from Lacy, she glanced at Dani who slept quietly.
			<i>I can't think of any other place I'd rather be. </i>Naturally a late sleeper, Gage acquiesced the urge to fall back to sleep easily. With a satisfied smile, happy, content and feeling the love of a real family, Gage closed her eyes.
		</p>
		<p>Some time later, Lacy not fully awake, burrowed closer to the writer next to her. Fitting her long, slender form next to Gage like a glove, Lacy sighed in contentment. She smiled in the warmth that greeted her. Blue eyes popped open as she realized just whom she was snuggling up against. As shock dawned into comprehension of how they ended up together in the same bed, Lacy eased back away from the writer. But the immediate sense of loss overwhelmed her drawing her back next to Gage, snuggling even closer.
			<i>I can't think of any other place I'd rather be. </i>This unexpected thought startled the star, but she didn't budge from the place she had secured next to the writer, which strangely felt like home.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy refused to dwell on these invading thoughts that could threaten her present way of life. Instead, she tucked them away, blaming them on the stressful events of the last few days. Naturally an early riser, Lacy fought the urge to get up. Happy, content and safe surrounded by the ones she loved Lacy closed her eyes.</p>
		<p>A few long moments passed when small giggles woke Lacy from her light sleep. She met her son's bright smile as he leaned over Gage, grabbing at his mother. Propping herself up on her elbow, Lacy reached over Gage and kissed her son good morning. He smiled then fell back between Gage and his sister, giggling. "Come on. Give me a kiss." She said.</p>
		<p>"No." His small hands hid his face.</p>
		<p>"Please. Just one little kiss. Okay?" She encouraged her son to return the good morning kiss. </p>
		<p>Shaking his head, Derek wiggled.</p>
		<p>Still sleeping, Gage shifted slightly back toward Lacy away from the small boy causing mother and child both to giggle at having almost awoken the writer. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Shhhhh." Lacy waited for Gage to finally settle. "Now, come on, sweetheart, how bout a good morning kiss. Please." She implored.</p>
		<p>From the depths of a light sleep, Gage heard the inviting plea. Eyes slowly dragging open, she turned to the sound of an intoxicating voice calling her.
			<i>Kiss me. Is that what she said? </i> Sleepy green gazed into waiting blue, debating the proffered request. Gage wetted her lips in anticipation.
		</p>
		<p>Lacy swallowed hard at the realization of what Gage was thinking.
			<i>She thinks I want her to kiss me. Do I? My God, where did that come from? </i>Lacy dismissed the thought as easily as it had come.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Derek bolted up and over Gage at his mother, placing a wet kiss upon her cheek. He fell between them laughing at his antics, disrupting what may have been.</p>
		<p>Gage pushed back away from Lacy, bumping up against Dani. "Hey, what'd doing trying to push me outta bed?" Dani protested. "If you wanted me to move, you coulda just asked."</p>
		<p>Thankful for Dani's early morning grumbling, Gage negotiated her way out of the huge bed.
			<i>My God, I almost kissed her. What the hell would she have thought? What the hell was I thinking? She only wanted to kiss her son....not me. </i>Gage stumbled around the room a bit, searching for something, anything to divert her thoughts from what almost happened. Tripping over a chair, Gage swooped up her clothes, then headed for the connecting bathroom. "I'll be right back."
		</p>
		<p>Lacy watched in amusement as Gage frantically recoiled from the near kiss.
			<i>I wonder how she would have reacted if we'd actually kissed. </i>That consideration drove Lacy deeper into her musings, questioning her own feelings.
		</p>
		<p>"What's wrong with her?" Dani asked, wiping the sleep out of her eyes. </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"I've got it." Lacy whipped around Gage, grabbing the sausage filled skillet as the writer filled several glasses of orange juice. The kids waited patiently. Well, as patiently as Dani could. </p>
		<p>"We're going to explore the cave today, right?" Dani asked her mother. "Mom? Right?"</p>
		<p>Lacy filled the plates full of food, ignoring her daughter. Her mind still lingering on the kiss she almost shared with Gage. As she sat a plate in front of Dani, she felt a tug at her arm. "Hmmmm?"</p>
		<p>"Are we going to go to the cave or not?" Dani demanded. But soon regretted her sharp tone when her mother's blue eyes met her own in disapproval.</p>
		<p>Gage quietly sat next to Derek, helping him as he ate his breakfast. Her thoughts lingered on the early morning events. She could still feel the longing, the tingling at the mere idea of brushing her lips up against the sweet smile that now adorned the star's face. Catching herself staring at Lacy, Gage reined her emotions in at the sound of Dani's question.</p>
		<p>"Gage, can we go to the cave today?" Dani decided to redirect her inquiry as her mother's mind was obviously on something else only to find that Gage was equally not in the present. </p>
		<p>Before Gage could answer, Lacy spoke up. "No, honey. The sheriff will be by today. I've got to go back to the cabin and see if anything is missing and...." She looked poignantly at Gage. "Maybe get some of our things, I guess."</p>
		<p>Gage immediately heard the reluctance in her voice. "You're not going back there. I mean you're going to stay here, right? I mean, the window's broken and who ever it was might come back and...."
			<i>Great! Now she won't want to stay.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			A knock at the door temporarily prevented Lacy from answering. Lacy rose from the table to let the young deputy in. "Deputy. Please come in. Would you like some breakfast?" She walked back to the kitchen, the deputy close on her heels.
		</p>
		<p>"No....no, thanks. And please call me Ted." He smiled sweetly.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"I'll be right with you."
			Lacy called, stopping him from venturing further into the kitchen area where the family was enjoying their breakfast. Gage had been watching closely the interaction between the star and the deputy when Lacy leaned down to her. "Are you sure you don't mind if we stay a little longer? At least until...."
		</p>
		<p>"No. I mean, stay as long as you like." Gage released a breath she didn't know she was holding. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy squeezed the writer's shoulder in thanks. "Then would you mind staying with the kids while I go? I don't want them to have to go back there."</p>
		<p>Casting a quick glimpse at the unreasonably handsome deputy, Gage reluctantly agreed with her. "Sure, we'll find something to do." Standing up, concerned green eyes looked deeply at Lacy. "I'd rather you didn't go alone though....maybe I could go instead."</p>
		<p>Without thinking Lacy hugged Gage briefly. "Thank you." Her blue eyes filled with appreciation for the concern her new friend had shown. "But, you wouldn't know if something was missing. Believe me, knowing you are taking care of the kids while I do this.... well, I appreciate it."</p>
		<p>Gage walked Lacy and the deputy to the door, watching them drive off, she returned to the kitchen table wishing Lacy were back already.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The young deputy led the way, searching the cabin thoroughly before allowing Lacy inside. "It's okay to come in now. Everything looks about the same as last night."</p>
		<p>Lacy scanned the living room and adjoining kitchen. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until she entered her bedroom. Her clothes and some personal items were scattered haphazardly on the floor and bed. Lacy immediately began sorting through them, picking up the items off the floor. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trying to be of help, the deputy reached for a few items pulling up a pair of red panties offering it to her. </p>
		<p>"Thanks." Lacy grabbed them from him.</p>
		<p>He blushed after realizing just what he had given her. Jumping up, he stepped back. "I guess you can get the rest. I'll check the other rooms. You'll be okay here?"</p>
		<p>She nodded. Glad to be alone, Lacy collected the rest of her belongings. A short while later, with bag in hand, she walked into the living room to find Ted jotting down some notes in his logbook. "Other than some clothing and a broach, everything seems to be here."</p>
		<p>Looking up from his notes, the deputy smiled. "I'll need a list of the missing items."</p>
		<p>"Just some of my clothes. Nothing of the kids stuff." </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"I'll need specifics, if you don't mind." Ted offered her a seat at the kitchen table. "For my report."</p>
		<p>Embarrassed, Lacy reluctantly informed him. "Okay, some bras and underwear."</p>
		<p>Putting pen to paper, the deputy repeated. "Bras and under...." Realization hit him. "That's it?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, besides the broach, of course."</p>
		<p>They spent the next few minutes detailing the description of the broach and underwear for the report before the deputy scooted his chair backwards. Noting that Lacy mentioned a red lacy bra was missing, the deputy quickly deduced it probably was the match to the pair of red lacy panties he picked up earlier. "I'll help you get the rest of your things together and we can go now. Do you want a ride to town or something?"</p>
		<p>Without notice the front door to the cabin opened, startling them. Toting a tool bag in one hand and a brown paper covered rectangular sheet under the other arm, Ralph walked in, grunted at the intruders then dropped the bag on the floor. "Deputy."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Ralph, what are you doing here?" The deputy asked.</p>
		<p>"Ms. Raye asked me to come by and fix the door." He slipped on a pair of gloves. Picking at the broken glass still lodged in the doorframe, Ralph ignored them.</p>
		<p>"I guess it's okay. The boys already did a check of the place. And we're through here." He glanced at Lacy who nodded in agreement.</p>
		<p>Grabbing a couple of bags, an unsettling shiver shot through Lacy as she walked around the handyman who reluctantly moved aside. "Excuse me."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>His dark brown eyes bore a hole in her as she passed through the door to the porch. "Mrs. Levine." He said with a menacing tone, leering at her.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The handyman's demeanor did not go unnoticed by the young deputy who also spied a pane of glass that appeared to be a perfect replacement for the one that was broken. "What's that?"</p>
		<p>"It's going in here." The handyman grunted, pointing to the empty hole in the door.</p>
		<p>"How'd you know what size you'd need?" The deputy asked suspiciously.</p>
		<p>"Had an extra. These things get broken all the time with different people coming and going. Not caring cause they don't own the place. Sally, I mean, Ms. Raye is just too nice... rents rooms to just anyone." Ralph strung together more words than he ever had in this lifetime. </p>
		<p>Accepting his explanation for the time being, Ted marched past the handyman. "Ralph, I'll see ya around." </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>When Lacy arrived back at the writer's cabin, she found the breakfast dishes were clean and Gage and the kids lounging in the living room watching a movie on the television. Ted deposited her bags on the porch before he drove off. Unhappy that Lacy was staying with the writer, he decided to take his leave without further investing time in what he now considered a lost cause. The deputy wanted to get to know the television star a little better.
			<i>Maybe next time.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Upon seeing her mother enter the cabin, Dani jumped up. "Can we go to the cave now?"</p>
		<p>Gage intercepted the question, sensing that Lacy was a bit on edge. "I thought we'd go to town and get a few things. Like food, for instance."</p>
		<p>Lacy nodded absent-mindedly then quickly turned off the television set. She continued to stare at the blank screen.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Dani, why don't you and Derek go get cleaned up before we go to town?" Gage asked.</p>
		<p>With pursed lips, Dani shrugged yet went along with the request. "Come on." She grabbed her brother's hand.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Gage called after her. "We'll get some ice cream, okay?"</p>
		<p>The bright smile that flashed across Derek's face mirrored that of his sister. "I like ice scream." Derek said sincerely to his sister being scooted him down the hallway in front of her.</p>
		<p>The writer turned her attention to the distraught Lacy. "What's wrong?" Gage walked with Lacy to the couch.</p>
		<p>"It's nothing really." The smile she displayed didn't reach her eyes. "Did you know Mrs. Raye has a handyman?"</p>
		<p>"Ralph?"</p>
		<p>"Yes. He's...."</p>
		<p>"A little, no, a lot weird." Gage supplied. "Was he there?"</p>
		<p>"He came when we were about ready to leave. He was there to fix the door."</p>
		<p>"Did he say something to you?" Gage asked, realizing that his appearance had upset the star.</p>
		<p>"It wasn't what he said, it was the way he looked at me. Like he didn't like me or... I don't know." Lacy shook her head. "It just unnerved me a bit."</p>
		<p>Wrapping her arms around Lacy in comfort, Gage said. "Hey, I understand completely. He's got that one eye that darts off in one direction while the other one looks like its making circular motions." Gage tried to mimic the movement in an attempt to lighten the mood.</p>
		<p>The brevity of the moment took root and Lacy let her uneasy feelings about the handyman fade as Gage created an entirely different picture of a wild eyed Ralph in her mind. With that silly picture floating in her brain, the feeling of danger she experienced about the handyman disappeared. "You're right. Come on." Lacy stood up. "Help me with the bags."</p>
		<p>Gage followed closely, feeling something else was bothering the actress. "Did anything come up missing?"</p>
		<p>With two bags in hand, Lacy passed the writer as she re-entered the cabin. "A broach my grandmother gave me and... some underwear." Lacy mumbled the last part.</p>
		<p>Collecting the rest of the bags, Gage stepped by inside. "Some Tupperware? Why would they take Tupperware? Don't tell me you have some..." Gage's voice took on a dramatic posture. "Gucci Tupperware. Really, Lacy, I know you're a big star and everything but...." Gage noticed a stern look on the star's face.</p>
		<p>"Not Tupperware....underwear." Lacy admitted then turned and marched to the bedroom.</p>
		<p>Opening her mouth, Gage paused briefly before she replied. "I guess we're going to town to get some food ....and underwear. Interesting combination." She said out loud.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>After buying some personal items at the town's only department store, Gage suggested getting some lunch before going to the grocery store. Lacy shook her head when Gage told everyone to get what they wanted upon their arrival at Sally's Market.</p>
		<p>Dani took her words literally, filling the cart with candy, Suzy-Qs and a couple of boxes of Captain Crunch cereal. Derek happily tried to rip open every item Dani tossed in while Lacy discreetly returned a few items to the shelves. Lacy spent a few moments perusing the few paperback books the store carried, but couldn't find the one she was looking for.</p>
		<p>When they reached the check out, Gage surveyed their overloaded cart. "I think we have room for one more item." The flippant sarcastic comment hung in the air until Derek grabbed for a toy water gun.</p>
		<p>Lacy noticed her landlord, who was also the owner of Sally's Market, was their check out clerk. "Hello Mrs. Raye. You heard about the break in I gather."</p>
		<p>Sally scanned the items. "Ralph tells me you're staying with her." Nodding toward the writer who was debating with Derek between the blue water gun and the green one.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Yes. I'd rather not take the kids back to the cabin. At least not yet." Lacy offered in way of an explanation.</p>
		<p>"You'll still have to pay for the full stay." Sally informed her tenant. "It's too late to get anyone else in there and I can't be losing money."</p>
		<p>"I believe my husband paid in advance. For the whole month. Correct?" The fact that her husband never paid in advance captured her attention only for a moment.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, he did. It's not my fault you know. People breaking in. There's some crazy people come up here in the summer. We get all kinds." Sally shot a disapproving look at Gage. Sally broadcast the news of the break in to everyone she'd come into contact with, telling them that some crazed stalker must have followed the television star and is now threatening the community. Sally always did have a way of embellishing things. It was her way.</p>
		<p>Lacy couldn't help but notice Sally's dislike for Gage.
			<i>I wonder what that's all about.</i> "Keep the money."
		</p>
		<p>"So you won't be wanting the cabin for the rest of your stay?" Sally hoped she could get another renter in for the rest of the month thus getting double rent for the cabin.</p>
		<p>"That's correct." Lacy informed her, having decided she didn't want to deal with Sally anymore.</p>
		<p>Sally quickly finished scanning the purchases including the last minute toy Gage tossed on the counter.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>With the Jeep loaded up, on their way out of town, Gage pulled her car in front of the hardware store. "I've got to pick up a piece of screen for the door. Be back in a minute."</p>
		<p>Waiting patiently for Gage to return, Derek played with his new toy gun and Dani flipped through the magazine she picked out at the store while Lacy noticed Ralph exit the hardware store. He stopped abruptly upon seeing the television star. Scratched his week old whiskers, before deciding to approach the Jeep.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Lacy checked the door's locks and squeezed the window shut tightly. Her heartbeat began to race with each step he took toward the Jeep. A deep sigh of relief fanned through her when she saw Gage whip around the handyman and jump into the Jeep.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Tossing the roll of screen in the seat behind her, Gage noticed a few beads of sweat hanging precariously from Lacy's forehead then noticed the old man standing a few feet from the Jeep staring at them. "You okay?"</p>
		<p>"No. Yes. Could we just leave please?" Lacy faced straight ahead.</p>
		<p>Gage ignited the engine and gunned the Jeep onward, away from the staring man. A quick look around the car to each of the occupants, Gage observed Lacy relax a bit while Dani stared back at the man intently.</p>
		<p>Dani's sixth sense kicked in. "I don't like him."
			<i>He's danger. I can sense it.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>It was a long ride home with little more said.</p>
