<!-- Legend \ Chapter 4: Vengeance -->

<p>The colonel had left for DC earlier that day, the rest of the
initiative were to report there in a week for debriefing, the entire
project had been scrapped before it got under way.  Now the forty
remaining Commandos stood at what use to be the entrance to their
complex, which was soon to be filled with concrete and the events of
the past few days forgotten , the deaths of their comrades would be
written off by the bureaucrats as if it had never happened.  All
because something had come and destroying all the research and
releasing the vampires, they were not sure what had done it but they
had a week before they had to report to DC and they were going to
find whoever or whatever had done this.</p>

<p>A group of vampires rapidly made their way through the darkness
towards the campus, they minds were focused on one thing, vengeance.
The blonde vampire in the front smoked a cigarette as he walked, his
mind wasn't focused towards the commandos that had imprisoned him
like the others, but filled with thoughts of the slayer and her
precious little friends.  Oh how they had annoyed him,  he was unable
to do anything about it when he was temporally incapacitated, but now
all that had changed and he had several threats he wished to make
good on.  He had hoped the master would let him go after the slayer,
but that was not the case,  She was the masters.   His face suddenly
developed an evil smirk, yes the master would deal with the slayer
but her friends were another story, he just couldn't decide who
would
be first.  That however would have to wait for the appointed time,
dealing with these commodes would be enough, for now.</p>

<p>Buffy and Angel were patrolling the cemetery  when three vamps jumped
out from behind some headstones and charged at Angel.   Angel
connected with a left hook on the first one to reach him and Buffy
intercepted one of the others and greeted him with a series of quick
punches and jabs.  She then followed it up with a round house kick
that sent him flying backwards.  Angel greeted the third vampire with
a elbow to the chest followed by a leg sweep that put him on the
ground.  Then the first vamp managed to tackle him knocking him to
the ground.  Buffy grabbed a stake and tossed it through the air as
the vampire she had nailed with the round house as he regained his
balance.  The stake was right on target and he instantly turned to
dust.  She saw that Angel was wrestling with one of the vamps on the
ground and that the other one was rushing to help fight him.  She
knocked the vamp down with a forearm accrosed the chest as he ran to
the other vamps aid.  She then produced Mr. Pointy and staked him
before he could get back up.  She looked over in Angels direction
just in time to se the brooding vamp stake his foe.  She helped Angel
up and they resumed their patrol.  As they left the area a figure
seemly stepped out of nowhere and watched as they departed.  Vlad
could hardly believe what he had just witnessed, one of his own had
betrayed their kind and was aiding the slayer.  He clutched his
ancient fist in anger, he had not felt this enraged in centuries.
<This traitor must die and he must die soon>, Vlad`s eyes were
filled
with fury as he walked off in the direction opposite of the way the
slayer and the traitor had went.</p>

<p>The initiative had divided up into eight, five man teams and now was
actively patrolling the campus.  Team one spotted a vampire and had
carefully worked their way to within a hundred yards of him thinking
that he had not noticed them.  They were ready to open fire on him
when the blonde vampire turned around facing them, "Nice of you
to
join us, mates" said Spike.</p>

<p>As he finished the sentence the group was jumped from both sides,
they had been lead into an ambush.  They tried to turn and get a shot
at their attackers but the vamps had to much of a head start on them
and it was over in just a mater of a few quick seconds.</p>

<p>Buffy and Angel had encountered two more vampires as they were
leaving the cemetery to go check out the campus.  Buffy caught one
of  the vamps with a good right cross knocking him to the ground, but
he immediately jumped back up and attacked with a series of jabs and
left hooks.  The slayer blocked each one and connected with the
occasional jab in between the vampires punches.  Angel had ended up
with the weaker of the to vampires,  He blocked the vamps initial
assault and countered with a solid right hook followed by a uppercut
sending his opponent flying backwards into a tombstone, before the
vamp could regain his composer Angel greeted him with a stake to the
chest.  The other vamp and Buffy continued to fight, with neither one
of them making any head way when Buffy managed to get in a leg sweep
sending him to the ground.  She quickly followed up with Mr. Pointy
to the heart, the fight was over.</p>

<p>Team two had just found the remains of team three.  Trying to reach
the others on the radio they quickly discovered that only teams five
and eight were responding.  They stood there as the other two teams
rushed to join them.  What had happened, they had started out the
night to repay their enemy for what had done to the others and now
over half their number had fallen.  The hunters had become the
hunted.  </p>

<p>As team Eight was rushing to their comrades they were ambushed by a
group of vampires from all sides.  One off the commandos got a drop
on a vamp and fired stunning his foe with the burst of energy from
his weapon.  He was getting aim on another one of them when he was
grabbed from behind by a blonde vampire who immediately drained him
of his life, revenge is so very sweet thought Spike as he finished of
the commando.</p>

<p>Buffy and Angel stood their looking at the group of five commandos
that lay on the ground before them, it had been the forth group like
this they had found since they had started their patrol of the
campus.  To make matters even worse they also had found six students
scattered along the way, who had the misfortune of being out and
about in Sunnydale after night fall.  The strangest thing was that
with all these victims they had not seen a single vampire since they
had left the cemetery.  Whoever was doing these attacks on campus was
hitting their targets hard and fast and then moving on.  </p>

<p>"Buffy , I think we have seen enough for tonight."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think your right."  Buffy paused for a moment,
"Angel, I
don't like this at all.  there is something wrong about the whole
thing"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well the attacks on theses mysterious commandos seems to be
planned.  They were all attacked in areas were they could have been
ambushed and from the looks of things it doesn't look like any of
them got a chance to put up a fight"</p>

<p>"Spike," Said Angel as Buffy nodded in agreement, both of
them
recalling the trouble he had created last time he was on a rampage,
but now it was different, now he was working for Vlad Tepes Dracul.</p>

<p>The ten remaining initiative members stood in a small clearing on the
campus.  They had given up on avenging their friends and were now
waiting for the other team to get there so they could figure out how
they were going to survive the night.  They heard someone approaching
and looked to that direction hoping it was their comrades.  It was
however a vampire that emerged from the darkness, Spike had came
around the corner and was now facing them.  The blonde vamp looked at
the young men and smiled, "We end this now"</p>

<p>Vampires swarmed them from all directions.  Outnumbering them two to
one, the vampires rapidly overran the remaining members of the
imitative, their commander was going to be very much alone in DC.
After the battle was over Spike looked at the others, "Return now
to
the Master, I will be there shortly," He had a gleam in his eye
as he
finished speaking, "I have some friends I need to check up on"</p>

<p>Willow hugged the slayer as soon as she came into the room, she had
spent the last few hours pacing back and forth unable to concentrate
while her love was out on patrol.  Buffy graciously returned the
redheads hug ensuring her that she was fine.  They then walked over
to were they had pushed their tow beds together and sat down.  Willow
laid her head on the slayers shoulder as Buffy gently put her arm
around the redhead.</p>

<p>"I missed you"</p>

<p>"I wasn't gone for that long"</p>

<p>"Yeah but when your out patrolling it seems longer than it really
is"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I will always make it home to my Wills"</p>

<p>"Promise"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I promise"</p>

<p>"Good because I love you so much," Said Willow as she tilted
her head
towards Buffy leaning in for a kiss.</p>

<p>Outside the dorm stood a blonde vampire smoking a cigarette, as he
watched the two girls through their dorm room Window.  He flicked the
cigarette to the ground putting it out with his boot, then turned
slowly walking back to join the others, this was a very interesting
development,  one the Master would be most interested in.</p>
