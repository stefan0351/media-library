<!-- Halloween \ Part Four -->

<p>The last place in the world Brooke wanted to be was in a dank dusty garage with no one but a spastic Sam for company. She wanted to be alone. She was in a foul mood. Black is the color and none is the number, as her dad's Dylan record said, which she had just seen in a box in the corner. Brooke had been near tears all day and she knew it wouldn't take much to send her over the edge. Silence had reigned in the garage for a while now, and Sam had finally given up trying to cheer her up. They now were working separately, tidying up and going through old boxes, most of which were from when Sam and her mom had moved in. The leftover detritus of combining households took up quite a bit of space.</p>
<p>Sam didn't know what Brooke's problem was. She hadn't seen her so moody in a long time. Maybe it was a delayed reaction from her breakup with Harrison. It was fortunate then that Sam's spirits were high enough not to be bothered by Brooke's cold shoulder. She was still buzzing from her little self-actualization exercise yesterday. She wanted to sweep Brooke into her arms and spin her around until they were both dizzy and out of breath. After that she didn't really know, but she was sure it would be nice. Enjoying this now was a priority because Sam had the suspicion that she would be miserable once the newness of it wore off and she had time to think about how unrequited her feelings really were.</p>
<p>Pushing Brooke to talk about whatever was bothering her was probably not a good idea, so Sam had stopped trying for the moment. She had found an old clock radio and tuned into the only station she could receive clearly, an eighties station. Her energy level was off the charts so she picked up a broom and found herself dancing and singing along with Olivia Newton John's seminal disco hit, "Physical," as she swept her way out into the driveway.</p>
<p>Brooke stood with her hands on her hips, contemplating an enormous cardboard box that was immovable. She knew; she had tried to move it. She looked for Sam to help her, and saw her flailing about with her broom in some approximation of a dance move. Were those jazz hands? God, she looked like an extra from Newsies. Brooke didn't know what was up with Sam today. School had been a nightmare, what with Sam pinging off the walls all day, avoiding Harrison, and enduring Nicole and Mary Cherry's constant pleas for attention. Brooke just wanted this day to end, but Sam seemed determined to draw out this hell of housework by practicing her pop stylings instead of finishing the job.</p>
<p>"Hey Freakshow," Brooke called to Sam. "Can you help me with this box?"</p>
<p>Sam put down her broom and went to help Brooke. "Sure, Grumbelina," she replied, smiling. She stood next to Brooke and prepared to push. When their bodies accidentally touched, Sam felt all the little hairs on her arm stand straight up, and her heart began to pound in her chest. Together they moved the heavy box into an open space where they had some room. Sam opened the flaps and exclaimed, "Ugh. I thought I had seen the last of these ugly things."</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked Brooke, mildly curious.</p>
<p>Sam pulled up the corner of a brutally ugly piece of fabric. "This is a box full of curtains that used to hang in my Great Aunt Theresa's house about a million years ago. I have no idea why my mom lugged them here. They sat in the basement in this very same box the whole time I lived in my old house. They are truly heinous. You would think she'd want to get rid of them."</p>
<p>"This whole box is drapes?" Brooke marveled. "She must have had miles of windows." Brooke fingered the material. It was thick napped velvet with a silk liner. That's why Jane kept the curtains, Brooke thought. The material was beautiful; maybe magenta and lime stripes would come back into fashion, if they were ever in fashion to begin with.</p>
<p>Sam watched as Brooke pawed the material and deadpanned, "Please tell me your not thinking about making us matching outfits so we'll have play clothes to wear for touring Salzburg while riding bicycles and singing. I don't do lederhosen."</p>
<p>Brooke's mouth turned up in a small smile at this, Sam was gratified to see. Then the smile disappeared and Brooke's face became tense as she struggled to hold back tears. Concerned, Sam drew closer but Brooke stepped back, hugging her arms to herself. A flash of hurt passed through Sam, but she pushed it away and said, "Brooke, why don't you take a break? I'll keep working. Why don't you go get us a drink or something?"</p>
<p>Sam started closing up the box of curtains as she surreptitiously watched Brooke leave the garage. Then she stopped, an idea forming, and tugged on the fabric, freeing it from it's home of over twenty years.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke gazed at her reflection in the downstairs bathroom mirror. Her tear stained face looked back at her accusingly. She shouldn't be allowed to enjoy Sam's jokes. Why should she be having fun when she had made others miserable? She sat down on the toilet and tried to collect herself. She guessed she should be happy she had found out what kind of person she really was. No more illusions that she was good and decent. She was a user of people. After washing her face and taking several deep breaths Brooke felt more composed. Then she went into the kitchen and got two bottles of water. All she needed was more guilt, this time for leaving Sam out there by herself for too long.</p>
<p>Back in the garage there was no sign of Sam, but what looked like a large magenta and lime-striped boulder had appeared where Mike's car was usually parked. Sam poked her head through folds of fabric and waved her over. Brooke approached the... structure, for lack of a better word. Lawn chairs and patio furniture gave it its form, and she saw that a few ski poles and gardening implements were strategically placed for support. And the whole thing was covered in magenta and lime-hued velvet.</p>
<p>"There's usually a password into this fort, but I think I can get you in," Sam whispered, as she looked left, then right for intruders. She was so cute that Brooke had to smile. Sam parted the curtains for her, giving Brooke enough room to crawl inside. More velvet curtains thrown over patio cushions made the concrete floor a cozy nest. They sat facing each other, Indian-style. Sam turned on a flashlight and pointed it upwards, casting an atmospheric glow to the tiny room.</p>
<p>"How did you do this? I've only been gone, like, ten minutes," Brooke wondered.</p>
<p>"It was a cinch. My dad and I used to do this all the time when I was a kid, only we used dining room chairs and blankets. And everything was handy here in the garage. Lately I've been wishing I had a fort of my own when I wanted a little privacy," she concluded, embarrassed.</p>
<p>"I remember doing this with my dad, too," Brooke said wistfully. She offered Sam a bottle of water. They were silent for a few moments. "Sam?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"It kinda smells in here," Brooke said, her nose wrinkling in distaste.</p>
<p>"I was hoping you wouldn't notice that," Sam admitted.</p>
<p>"Like cat pee."</p>
<p>"Brooke, we don't even have a cat, it's just musty." Sam thought for a second and snapped her fingers. "Hang on, just a second." She scooted out of the fort and Brooke could hear her rummaging through boxes close by. When she came back she had a fat green candle resting on a tin pie plate that Brooke knew for a fact her dad used to catch slugs in the garden. She decided not to tell Sam.</p>
<p>"This is my mom's Christmas candle. She just puts it on the coffee table year after year and never lights it." Sam took a pack of matches from her pocket. "Well, I'm lighting this baby. She deserves a new one. I think it's supposed to smell piney."</p>
<p>Brooke turned out the flashlight and let the glow of the candlelight fill the dark interior. "I feel ensconced in velvet," she smiled at Sam. Sam grinned back at the reference. They had watched that episode of Seinfeld together recently. "So if you haven't named your fort yet, I propose Fort Stinky."</p>
<p>"I like it," Sam said amiably. She hesitated before she spoke again, gently. "I think you are going through something or have a problem to work out. Maybe having a new place in which to think about it might help. So, if you feel like talking about it we can, or I can go and let you have some privacy," she trailed off, trying to gauge Brooke's reaction.</p>
<p>Brooke was undecided. Maybe talking about it would help. But she really didn't want Sam to know how horrible a person she was. She was silent for so long that Sam got to her knees and started crawling out of the fort. "You don't have to go, Sam. I want you to stay."</p>
<p>Sam stopped and maneuvered herself back into the fort. She lay down on her side and propped her head in her hand, facing Brooke, her head close to the candle. "Boy, this is one fast-acting candle," she said as she sniffed the air.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Brooke agreed. "I can't smell the cat pee anymore, now it just smells like Christmas exploded in here."</p>
<p>"Too bad mom doesn't put out a Halloween candle. We could've had a pumpkin spice bomb instead. Maybe it's too powerful. I bet we could burn this candle, a cigar, a pile of tires, and a big bowl of hair all at the same time and it would still smell all 'Deck the Halls' in here."</p>
<p>Brooke was amused, and she was feeling better. "Thank you for always knowing how to make me feel better," she said shyly.</p>
<p>"It's nothing," Sam scoffed. "My natural wit, astounding intelligence and sparkling sense of humor are at your disposal, not to mention my acute sense of modesty." She waggled her eyebrows like Groucho Marx, and then said seriously, "Besides, you would do the same for me, and you have done."</p>
<p>"I want you to know that your friendship is important to me," Brooke said with gravity.</p>
<p>And if that's all I'll ever have, I'll take it and be grateful, Sam thought to herself. "You'll always have it," she vowed.</p>
<p>Brooke let out a dry, humorless laugh. "Don't be too quick to say that."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Sam watched as Brooke looked her in the eye and then looked down into her lap as she collected her thoughts.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, I found something out about myself," Brooke began.</p>
<p>Wow, coincidence, me too, Sam thought to herself. She didn't dare to hope that they had come to the same realization, but that's what came to mind.</p>
<p>"I discovered I'm not the person I thought I was. Yesterday I was one thing, and today I am something completely different," Brooke continued.</p>
<p>Okay, can she vague this up for me? Maybe she is talking about what I think she's talking about, Sam thought.</p>
<p>"Do you remember the other day when you said Harrison and I were 'disgustingly happy?'" Brooke asked, using the familiar air quotes.</p>
<p>Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"We weren't," Brooke stated flatly. "And the reason we weren't is because I am a terrible person. I was using Harrison from the very start, and he knew it. He thought my feelings would change so he went along with it, but when we broke up he laid out the evidence that proves what a monster I am."</p>
<p>Ah, Sam thought, a little disappointed. It is about her and Harrison. Well, I can do the shoulder to cry on thing. Then she caught up, did she just say monster? The hell?</p>
<p>Brooke was getting distressed and talked with increasing speed in a voice thick with emotion. "I'm grateful to him, actually, for showing me my true ugly nature. I'm not a nice person, Sam," she confessed.</p>
<p>Before Brooke could continue, Sam sat up, raised her hand in a halting gesture and said, "Brooke, whoa, slow down." Sam actually thought Brooke was laying it on a bit thick with this monster talk and everything; this wasn't All My Children, for God's sake. But she took the emotions behind the words very seriously, and was determined to help any way she could. "First of all, you are not a terrible person. You are a kind person, and I know you would never intentionally hurt anyone."</p>
<p>"What about you? I would hurt you all the time when we used to fight like two Mexican wrestlers. And what about Josh?"</p>
<p>"Brooke, I'm not going to help you condemn yourself," But Brooke had made a fair point, Sam realized. "Okay, I'll admit that we did do our best to hurt each other, but" Sam was thinking on her feet. "But that was only because we both needed ammunition to hurl at each other. You were giving as good as you got, you had to defend yourself." That sounded weird, she thought. She was defending herself from me. She knows I totally forgive her for that, right? Get back on topic, Sam, she chastised herself.</p>
<p>"Anyway, if you did, indeed, 'use' Harrison, maybe he was using you too," Sam continued, now using air quotes herself. She tried to help Brooke work through the problem logically, thinking of possible scenarios. "Could it be that his idea of using is a little extreme? Or maybe you didn't know you were using him." Sam stopped when she saw Brooke jerk her head up and looked her in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I didn't," Brooke said. "Not until after."</p>
<p>Okay, now we're getting somewhere, Sam thought. "So he claims you used him, but you had no knowledge of such at the time. Obviously, his argument was persuasive or you wouldn't be feeling this badly. There must be a reason that he would bring this up. What are you not telling me, Brooke?"</p>
<p>Here was the part where she lost Sam as her friend, Brooke thought desolately. "He said I was doing it to make you feel bad. That I was intentionally rubbing your face in the fact that I had won and you had lost."</p>
<p>"Oh," was all Sam said. "And you think he's right?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Brooke lied; she knew he was right. She waited for Sam's anger.</p>
<p>Sam thought about this for a moment. "Well, you are clearly giving it some credence or you wouldn't be this upset."</p>
<p>Brooke couldn't believe Sam was so calm. "But aren't you upset with me, Sam? I mean, this is some seriously messed up behavior on my part."</p>
<p>"Brooke, this has nothing to do with me. Well, it does a little, but the main thing is to figure out the reasons for your actions. Sure, I'm curious to know why you felt the need to compete with me after I had already left the playing field, but it won't keep me up nights," Sam said reasonably. "I'm sure you had your reasons, and you'll figure them out eventually." She felt equipped to talk to Brooke about this despite the insane way she had worked through her own problem yesterday. She knew now from experience that sometimes it took a while for things to sort themselves out so the old cerebral cortex could understand them.</p>
<p>"So you're really not mad?" Brooke just wanted to be sure.</p>
<p>"Really. But I can be if you want me to," Sam scrunched up her eyebrows and bared her teeth, then put up her dukes, but only succeeded in looking more mentally impaired than angry. She saw Brooke grin at her antics. "So let's knock off the drama; I thought you were going for a daytime Emmy there."</p>
<p>Brooke was overcome with relief. She flopped down onto her back and turned her head towards Sam. She gazed at her with a sense of wonder, that Sam's good opinion could mean so much to her after such a long time of disharmony. Then she noticed how beautiful Sam looked in candlelight. "I still don't know what to do about Harrison, though. God, Sam, I feel really terrible."</p>
<p>Sam resumed the position where she was lying on her side, and moved the candle so it was out of her line of vision. "That might take some time to be resolved," she said, wondering why Brooke was looking at her so intensely. She looks gorgeous in this candlelight, Sam thought. The more time she spent with Brooke, the less she knew how she was going to conceal her feelings for her.</p>
<p>"Hey, did you ever get a costume? I completely forgot to ask you," Brooke inquired.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did. And it's all thanks to you, my dear. Great idea. In fact, I have the next ten or so Halloweens all wrapped up."</p>
<p>"So? Don't leave me hanging, what's it going to be?"</p>
<p>"All shall be revealed tomorrow. This is top secret stuff, you know."</p>
<p>"Hmm, mysterious," Brooke said.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's me. I'm a cipher, wrapped in an enigma, smothered in secret sauce," Sam kidded.</p>
<p>Brooke laughed a hearty belly laugh, totally out of proportion with Sam's lame joke. She couldn't help it; she was just so happy and relieved. "Sam, thank you so much for helping me through my little 'drama,' as you call it. You do not know how much it means to me." Brooke abruptly rolled over and threw her arm over Sam's shoulders, capturing her in an awkward hug.</p>
<p>Sam was completely unprepared for feeling the closeness of Brooke's body to hers. All of a sudden her face was buried in Brooke's hair and neck, and she breathed in the smell of her shampoo. The shock she felt from their contact was instantaneous. She moved the arm that wasn't supporting her weight up Brooke's back, gently massaging the muscles she found there. Sam had no willpower. She turned her head and kissed the corner of Brooke's mouth, hoping it was construed as friendly and not lustful. Brooke drew back her head and looked at her. Oops, lustful. Oh well, may as well push my luck if I'm going to get slapped anyway, she thought. She pressed her lips into Brooke's, amazed at their softness, and waited for Brooke to end it. When the slap didn't come, she deepened the kiss, and moved her hand up Brooke's neck to stroke her cheek. She could've sworn that Brooke's arms had never left her shoulders, and were in fact trying to pull her closer, her hands entwined in Sam's
 hair. Sam gently traced Brooke's lower lip with her tongue and was granted entry when Brooke's lips parted with a gasp. Sam moaned and knew she had to have more contact. She wanted to feel all of Brooke's body against hers.</p>
<p>Sam moved her knee and knocked the candle over, plunging them into darkness. For a moment neither girl reacted. Then she felt Brooke pull back and scramble away from her, as Sam bemusedly felt around for the candle, hoping the velvet drapes wouldn't ignite. She was relieved to feel that the candle had fallen into the pie plate filled with molten wax and had simply gone out. Suddenly there was a flash of natural light as Brooke found the exit to the fort and parted the curtains.</p>
<p>Brooke turned back to Sam for a moment and stuttered, "Sorry, Sam, I forgot there was, um, something I have to do." And then she was gone.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>She had blown it.</p>
<p>How could she have been so stupid? Sam couldn't even guess what Brooke thought of her now. An uncontrollable momentary impulse had probably ruined their friendship.</p>
<p>After a long while, Sam left the fort and finished the last of the garage clean up. It didn't take long, but she left the fort standing. She hoped Mike wouldn't mind parking outside for a while, she thought she might need a place to escape to in the days to come.</p>
