<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 10: Damaging Separation-->

<p>Faith stood hidden near the side of Sunnydale High listening to the gang’s new topic of discussion. It was about SAT scores. She knew that wouldn’t matter at all soon, so she was just enjoying listening to the pointless conversation.</P>
<p>The most amusing part was Willow’s nervous and sad voice while she complained about how she only got a 740 on the verbal section. The rest of her friends’ thought it was just her academic anxiety, but Faith knew it was because of her threat. </P>
<p>She had shown up as much as possible. And every single time, Willow became unraveled. Faith guessed she hadn’t told anyone, and knew she wouldn’t. She knew Willow would be easy to control. Unfortunately, it didn’t have the lasting effects she wanted. As soon as she was gone, Willow would seemingly forget about it, or as soon as Buffy kissed her or soothed her nerves, it was all forgotten.</P>
<p>She needed to step up the process. It was time to hurt Buffy. Faith knew how she wanted to do it, but the situation she wanted hadn’t presented itself yet. Listening closer now, she heard that Buffy got a high score on her test. For just a second, Faith was envious and even somewhat jealous of her. But just for a second.</P>
<p>Taking one last look, she walked off, hearing the tail end of the conversation.</P>
<p>"This is great. Now you can leave, and never come back." Cordelia said, talking to Buffy.</P>
<p>They stared at her.</P>
<p>"Well, I mean that in a positive way. Get out of Sunnydale. That's a good thing. What kind of moron would ever wanna come back here?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>At a night, at a small playground, a long, black car crashed through the 'Welcome to Sunnydale' sign and screeched to a halt. The driver’s side door opened and a liquor bottle fell out and smashed to pieces on the pavement. </P>
<P>Spike slid off of his seat and hit the street flat on his back on top of the broken glass, drunk. He lifted his head unsteadily and tried to raise himself to his elbows.</P>
<P>"Home, sweet...home." He said, slurring his words, chuckling.</P>
<P>He passed out and collapsed back to the pavement.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow was standing with Buffy at her locker. She wasn’t paying attention to what Buffy was saying. She was absorbed in her own thoughts. Her number one thought was - What does Faith want?</P>
<p>She and Buffy both knew that Faith wasn’t exactly on the straight and narrow path, but after her story they both pushed back their suspicions.</P>
<p><I>‘And why’d we buy it? Cause she was good.’ </P>
</I><p>They both bought into her sap story. That was their flaw. They always looked for the good in people before the bad. And Willow knew that Faith was definitely on the bad side. She didn’t know what Faith’s plan was, but she was pretty sure it had something to do with Buffy.</P>
<p><I>‘I hate not telling her.’</P>
<p></I>She was afraid of what Faith would do to her. She didn’t want to be. She knew if she told Buffy, she would do her best to protect her, but Willow was afraid that wouldn’t be enough. Faith had fooled all of them so far. What would happen if she told Buffy? Faith would probably concoct another story, and she’d end up in a hospital.</P>
<p>"…I just…I never expected to do that well." Buffy said.</P>
<p><I>‘What were we talking about again? Oh…SAT’s.’</P>
<p></I>"I told you that you weren’t a moron, didn’t I?"</P>
<p>"I guess I should know by now that you would always tell me the truth."</P>
<p>Willow frowned.</P>
<p>"Are you okay? You’ve been distracted lately."</P>
<p>"Yeah. Just tired."</P>
<p>Buffy shut her locker and they started walking down the hall.</P>
<p>"But 1440 is a great score, Buffy. You can easily go to UC Sunnydale, or any other college you want to go to."</P>
<p>"Slaying, remember?"</P>
<p>"Oh…well at least we can…"</P>
<p>"Get a place like we planned?"</P>
<p>"Yeah." Willow smiled.</P>
<p>"I have to patrol, but afterwards, did you wanna catch a movie?"</P>
<p>"Sure. I have a paper due next week, so I’ll be in the library researching."</P>
<p>"I’ll come get you."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Spike walked into his old factory carrying another liquor bottle. The place was scorched, and completely destroyed. He strolled through the area, stepping over the strewn chairs, while he mumbled to himself.</P>
<p>He went down the basement steps, in a drunken haze.</P>
<P>"Druscilla! I'm home!" He yelled happily.</P>
<P>When he reached the bottom he broke out into a fit of giggles which turned to sobs. Wiping his nose on his sleeve, he saw what was left of the burned bed and stepped up to it, steadying himself on a pillar. He tossed the bottle onto the bed and stepped around the column. </P>
<P>He caught sight of Druscilla's doll collection that didn’t survive the fire piled on her dresser, all scorched. He reached for one and picked it up. He stared at it.</P>
<P>"Why did you do it, baby? Why did you leave me? We were happy here."</P>
<P>He tried to suppress a sob and shook it off, and put on his game face. He roared and threw the doll hard at the floor. He spun around, looking for something to smash it with. He found a tall iron candlestick, grabbed it and started to swing at the doll.</P>
<P>"You... Stupid...Worthless…Bitch! Look what you've done to me."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Faith followed Willow after school was out. She had gone to the magic shop. Faith went around the back entrance, and saw Spike looking at the shelves. She saw him glance at her, but his attention was focused on Willow.</P>
<p><I>‘Who is this guy? He’s cute.’</P>
<p></I>"Blessed be." The shopkeeper said. "What can I help you with?"</P>
<p>"I need to get supplies for a protection spell. It’s for a friend. Early birthday present."</P>
<p>"Well, let me just grab the necessary items then."</P>
<p>The woman grabbed a few bags of different powders off the shelf behind the counter, and rang them up on the register. Putting the items in the bag, she told Willow the total. Willow handed her the money and walked out.</P>
<p>Faith started to go out the back, when she saw the shopkeeper come back where she and Spike were.</P>
<p>"Now did you find –" The lady started.</P>
<p>"I got a better idea." Spike said as he drained the woman.</P>
<p>He looked back at Faith.</P>
<p>"Nice work." She said, and walked out the door.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Mayor Wilkins was practicing putting in the company of his assistant Allan. He tapped the ball, and it came at the practice hole in a nearly perfect straight line, but just missing its target.</P>
<P>"Oh, look at that! Every time, cuts to the left."</P>
<P>He got down on his hands and knees to check the lie of the floor.</P>
<P>"See, and it's not the carpet. It's me. I swear, I would sell my soul for a decent short game. Of course, it's a little late for that. I don't suppose I could offer your soul, huh? Really help me on the green."</P>
<P>Allan gave him a shocked look.</P>
<P>"I'm just funning. So, we have a Spike problem, do we?" </P>
<P>"He's been spotted back in town."</P>
<P>The Mayor shot again, but this time, the ball came up short. </P>
<P>"And there was an incident at a magic shop in broad daylight. Police had a hell of a time covering it up."</P>
<P>"Well, yes, y'know, he was up to all sorts of shenanigans last year. We had a world of fun trying to guess what he'd do next."</P>
<P>"I remember." </P>
<p>The phone rang.</P>
<p>"Excuse me." The Mayor said, walking over to get the phone.</P>
<p>"Hello…Faith!…How’s my girl?…Really? You know, we were just talking about that…well, if you have something in mind you just say the word…Oh I’m sure I can find something to keep our British friend busy."</P>
<P>He hung up.</P>
<p>"Kids. They’re always one step ahead."</P>
<P>"Should I have Mr. Trick send a... committee to deal with this?"</P>
<P>"Why don't you take care of that Spike problem? A committee, like you said. Gotta give my Faith time to work."</P>
<P>"As good as done."</P>
<p>The Mayor lined up for another shot.</P>
<P>"That's swell. Fore!" The shot was directly on target. "Hey!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, at the library, Willow was studying. Putting the book down, she rubbed her forehead.</P>
<p>"Brain overload…" She said aloud.</P>
<p>Giles had gone home a half-hour ago and told her to lock up before she left. She had a lot on her mind. School, Buffy, and trying to avoid getting killed by Faith. It was too much for her to handle.  </P>
<P>She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and started reading again. She became so absorbed, that she didn’t hear Spike come in from the stacks up the stairs.</P>
<p>He quietly came down, and stood behind her. With unnatural speed, he clamped his hand over her mouth, and pulled her out of the chair. She was kicking wildly, and as they approached the stacks, she kicked several books off the shelves.</P>
<p>"I’m gonna borrow you for a little bit. You don’t mind, do you? We’re gonna be best friends."</P>
<p>He took her out the way he came in. Outside, Faith started following them.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"A spell. For me. You're gonna do a spell for me." Spike said to Willow back in the basement of the factory. Willow was sitting on the bed.</P>
<P>"Uh, what kind of spell?</P>
<P>"A love spell! Are you brain-dead? I'm gonna get what's mine. What's mine. Teach her to walk out on me." He drank from yet another bottle. "What are you staring at?"</P>
<P>"Nothing." Willow said, averting her eyes from Spike’s drunken form.</P>
<P>"You can do it, right? You can make Dru love me again? Make her crawl!"</P>
<P>"I…I can try."</P>
<P>He grabbed her neck. "What are you talking about, trying? You'll do it!"</P>
<P>"Yes, I'll do it!" She held back tears, but she was visibly frightened.</P>
<p>Breaking the bottle against the bedpost, he threatened her with the sharpened edge.</P>
<P>"You lie to me, and I'll shove this through your face! You want that?"</P>
<P>"No..."</P>
<P>"Right through to your brain!"</P>
<P>"No, please, no." She was crying now.</P>
<P>He calmed down and sat next to her.</P>
<P>"She wouldn't even kill me. She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head or set me on fire. I mean, is that too much to ask? You know? Some little sign that she cared?"</P>
<P>He paused, and took a deep breath.</P>
<P>"It was that truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone soft. Wasn't demon enough for the likes of her. And I told her it didn't mean anything, I was thinking of her the whole time, but she didn't care. </P>
<P>"So, we got to Brazil, and she was... she was just different. I gave her everything: beautiful jewels, beautiful dresses; with beautiful girls in them, but nothing made her happy. And she would flirt! I caught her on a park bench, making out with a chaos demon! Have you ever seen a chaos demon? They're all slime and antlers. They're disgusting."</P>
<P>He stroked Willow's hair.</P>
<P>"She only did it to hurt me. So I said, 'I'm not putting up with this anymore.' And she said, 'Fine!' And I said, 'Yeah, I've got an un-life, you know!' And then she said... she said we could still be friends. God, I'm so unhappy!" He started sobbing on her shoulder.</P>
<P>"There, there." She said softly, patting his knee.</P>
<P>"I mean, friends! How could she be so cruel?" He looked at her neck, game face on. "Mmm. That smell... Your neck...I haven't had a woman in weeks."</P>
<P>Willow jumped up in fright.</P>
<P>"Whoa! No! Hold it!"</P>
<P>"Well, unless you count that shopkeeper."</P>
<P>"Now, now, hold on! I…I'll do your spell for you, and, and, and I'll get you Druscilla back, but, but there will be no bottle-in-face, and there will be no 'having' of any kind with me. Alright?"</P>
<p>His face went back to normal.</P>
<P>"Alright. Get started."</P>
<P>"Now, I'm not a real witch, you know. I…I don't know if this is gonna work right away."</P>
<P>"Well, if at first you don't succeed, I'll break one of your fingers and you try again."</P>
<P>"This isn't enough." She said, looking through the supplies on the bed.</P>
<P>"What?" </P>
<P>"Well, there are other ingredients, and a…book. I need a spell book. This isn't it."</P>
<P>"You've got one, though, at home?"</P>
<P>"Not at home. The library."</P>
<p>"Why didn’t you tell me that before?"</P>
<p>"I had a hand over my mouth keeping me from speaking."</P>
<p>"I’ll go get it. Don’t bother trying to escape. It’s locked from the outside."</P>
<p>He went upstairs, went out the door, and it slammed shut behind him. Willow finally relaxed some. A few minutes later, though, the door opened again.</P>
<p><I>‘Now what?’</P>
<p></I>The door slammed shut, and Faith came down the stairs, carrying a knife.</P>
<p>"Hey, Red. What could you possibly be doing here?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy entered the library. She looked around for Willow, but instead she saw Spike. He was throwing books down on the floor in frustration. She ran up to him, and slugged him in the face.</P>
<p>"You shouldn't have come back, Spike."</P>
<P>"I do what I please."</P>
<P>He tried to grab her arm. Instead, she moved to the side, grabbed his arm, and started to pull his arm out of its socket. She kicked his legs out from underneath him, and he fell. Not wasting any time, she grabbed the stake she had in her hair, and prepared to use it.</P>
<P>"Willow!"</P>
<P>"You took Willow?"</P>
<P>"You do me now, you'll never find the little witch."</P>
<P>"Where is she?"</P>
<P>"Doesn't work like that, peaches. Your friend's gonna work a little magic for me. She does my spell, I let her go."</P>
<P>"You're not famous for keeping your promises, Spike."</P>
<P>"Well, you wanna tag along, that's fine. But you get in my way, and you kill the redhead."</P>
<p>Buffy punched him again.</P>
<p>"Oops. I slipped."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"What’re you doing here?"  Willow asked Faith.</P>
<p>"Keeping tabs on my new favorite toy."</P>
<p>"Who? Oh…that would be me."</P>
<p>"And here I thought you were intelligent."</P>
<p>Faith walked closer to the bed, and ran her knife along the bedpost.</P>
<p>"I haven’t said anything. I’ve been good."</P>
<p>"Yeah, I guess you have. It’s just, I figured that if I let you know that I’m not exactly on the light side, not to mention choke you to death, and threaten your life, it would’ve had more of an effect."</P>
<p>"If you want me to be more frightened, I can do that. No problem."</P>
<p>"See, the problem is, that as soon as you lay eyes on Buffy, every other thought in that head of yours just vanishes. Frankly, it makes me want to vomit."</P>
<p>"So why are you doing this to me?"</P>
<p>"I want to make Buffy suffer. I thought that you would push her away. And the fact that you knew something and couldn’t tell her, it would strain your relationship. It hasn’t worked."</P>
<p>"So now what?"</P>
<p>"Extreme measures. Time to speed things up. As soon as Buffy and the bleached vampire g  et back here, I’ll make sure she suffers."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Spike were walking down the street, on their way to the magic shop. Spike suddenly stopped and grabbed his head.</P>
<p>"Look, I just need a few supplies, and then I'll take you to...Oh, God."</P>
<P>"What's wrong? Not that I care."</P>
<P>"Oh...My head. I think I'm sobering up. It's horrible. Oh, God. I wish I was dead."</P>
<P>Buffy pulled out a stake. "Well, if you close your eyes and wish real hard..."</P>
<P>"Watch it!" He warned.</P>
<P>"You’ve probably just got her locked up in the factory."</P>
<P>"Well, hey, how thick do you think I am?" He stuttered.</P>
<P>"Fine. Can we just get this over with?"</P>
<P>She started down the road again. Spike followed close behind. When they reached a corner, he stopped at a bench.</P>
<P>"Oh, God."</P>
<p>Buffy put her hands on her hips.</P>
<P>"We killed a homeless man on this bench. Me and Dru. Those were good times."</P>
<P>He sat on the bench, and started to chuckle.</P>
<P>"You know, he begged for mercy, and you know, that only made her bite harder."</P>
<P>"I guess you had to be there." She said.</P>
<P>"So, I guess you offed Angel."</P>
<P>"Yep."</P>
<P>"You don’t seem too upset."</P>
<P>"What can I say? I’m a fast emotional healer. Can we get to Willow now?"</P>
<P>"You seem pretty set on finding her. You know I have her alive, so why’s it so important?"</P>
<P>Buffy looked around.</P>
<P>"Bloody hell. You hooked up with her."</P>
<P>"So?"</P>
<P>"I’m just…well, if I had known she was that important to you, I would’ve used her in a more creative way, is all."</P>
<P>"If you did that, you’d be dead by now. Here’s the shop. Let’s go."</P>
<p>Spike looked at her, and laughed. They went in, got the supplies, and walked back out to the street.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"So let me ask you something. Why her?" Faith asked.</P>
<p>"She’s everything you’re not."</P>
<p>Faith laughed, and stood in front of Willow, who was backing up.</P>
<p>"You’ve got guts. Don’t you ever get tired of Miss Goody-Goody? The Dark Side’s a lot more rewarding."</P>
<p>"Why do you want to hurt Buffy?"</P>
<p>"Cause she’s everything I’m not. Plus, I was assigned a job. It’s gotta be carried out."</P>
<p>"Who do you work for?"</P>
<p>"I ain’t telling. I do know that ever since I met him, I’ve gotten everything I ever wanted. I’m not giving that up to fight demons who will eventually win anyway."</P>
<p>Faith ran the knife along Willow’s shirt.</P>
<P>"Why will they win?"</P>
<p>Faith just grinned.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They started to walk. Both of them were carrying a box of supplies.</P>
<p>"Okay, Spike, we got the stuff. Where is she?"</P>
<P>"What's your hurry?"</P>
<P>"My hurry is my intense desire to get you out of my life. You tend to cause trouble."</P>
<P>"I'll be out of your life in a few short hours. No trouble at all."</P>
<P>Without warning they were confronted by a group of vampires. Their leader stepped forward.</P>
<P>"Hello, Spike."</P>
<P>"No trouble at all." Buffy said to herself.</P>
<P>"Lenny. How have you been?" Spike asked.</P>
<P>"Better since you left. You should have stayed gone."</P>
<P>"Is that right?" He tossed down the box he was holding.</P>
<P>"You know, he was just leaving. Don't you start anything." She said.</P>
<P>"This pissant used to work for me."</P>
<P>"You can walk away from this." Lenny said to Buffy.</P>
<P>"I die, your girlfriend dies."</P>
<P>"Sorry. I’m staying."</P>
<p>They ran back into the magic shop, and Buffy shut the door. Once inside, Buffy headed behind the counter to find a weapon. Spike grabbed one of the bookcases and slid it over against the front window. Behind the counter, Buffy smashed the shopkeeper's chair, and picked up the legs to use as stakes. </P>
<P>She came back out from behind the counter and tossed Spike one of the chair legs. They got in fighting stance and waited for the already teetering bookcase to give and the vampires to storm into the shop.</P>
<P>"This should be a kick." He said.</P>
<P>"I violently dislike you."</P>
<P>Suddenly, the back door was kicked in, and a vampire came inside. Buffy turned around to face him, and he lunged at her. She ducked and got underneath him, lifted him and sent him flying over her head and onto a table arrayed with books and candles. Two more vampires rushed in, and Buffy knocked over the second bookcase, barricading the back door, as well as putting the two vampires that had just entered, out of commission. </P>
<P>The first vampire got off of the table and tackled Spike into a wall of shelves filled with jars. Several of them broke and Spike and the jars crashed to the floor. The two vampires trapped under the bookcase were struggling to get free. Buffy saw their chests were still exposed, and staked them. </P>
<p>She went over to Spike’s attacker just as the bookcase gave on the backdoor, and staked him. Lenny came in, scanned the room, and headed straight for Spike. Behind him another vampire ran in, and Buffy rushed to engage him. </P>
<P>She roundhouse kicked him in the face and tried a backhand punch. He blocked the hit and wrapped his arm around hers and yanked her arm downward. She yanked back up and pulled her arm free, and punched him twice in the face. </P>
<P>Lenny reached Spike and immediately punched him hard in the face, making him jerk aside but not fall.</P>
<P>"Yeah. I heard you'd gone soft. Sad to see it, man." Lenny said.</P>
<P>"Soft?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, like baby food."</P>
<P>"Well, then, let's give baby a taste."</P>
<P>Lenny tried to punch, but Spike ducked and punched him instead. Spike spun around and backhand punched a vampire coming up behind him in the face, which fell immediately. He ducked another punch from Lenny, grabbed onto Lenny’s jacket, and pulled him around roughly and smashed his face into the table. He did it repeatedly.</P>
<P>"Baby like his supper? Baby like his supper?"</P>
<P>Buffy was still fighting with another vampire. She shoved him into a shelf, and he stumbled backwards. Before he could recover his balance, she staked him. There was one other vampire in the store, and several others out front. Examining the shelf closer, Buffy saw several bottles of holywater.</P>
<P>Spike flipped Lenny over onto his back, and raised the still unused chair leg.</P>
<P>"Why doesn’t baby have a nap?" He shoved the leg right into Lenny’s chest, and he turned to dust.</P>
<P>Buffy grabbed several bottles of holywater. Spike saw her and came to get some as well. On the way, he staked a vampire that was just starting to get up, through the back.</P>
<P>They both started chucking bottle after bottle at the oncoming vampires. Eventually, they all ran away.</P>
<P>"Now, that was fun."</P>
<P>Buffy gave him a disbelieving look.</P>
<P>"Oh, don't tell me that wasn't fun. Oh, God! It's been so long since I had a decent spot of violence. Really puts things in perspective."</P>
<P>"Could we just do the damn spell now?"</P>
<P>"Oh, sod the spell. She’s at the factory."</P>
<p>Buffy gave him a ‘I can’t believe you put me through this’ look.</P>
<P>"I'm really glad I came here, you know? I've been all wrong-headed about this. Weeping, crawling, blaming everybody else. I want Dru back, I've just gotta be the man I was, the man she loved. I'm gonna do what I shoulda done in the first place: I'll find her, wherever she is, tie her up, torture her, until she likes me again."</P>
<P>He smiled. "Love's a funny thing."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Back in the basement of the factory, Willow and Faith heard footsteps upstairs.</P>
<P>"Now who could that be?" Faith asked. "Show time, Red."</P>
<p>She pushed Willow down on the bed, and started kissing her. She situated her knife under Willow’s neck. Faith held Willow’s head just enough, so her neck wouldn’t get sliced on the blade.</P>
<p>"Look like you’re starting this, or you’ll get sliced and diced. Got it?"</P>
<p>Willow, reluctantly, put her hand on Faith’s head. The door opened from above, and Buffy started to come down.</P>
<p>"Willow are you…Oh my God."</P>
<p>From Buffy’s perspective, it looked as though Willow was holding Faith’s head keeping her from pulling away from the kiss. Buffy ran back upstairs. Willow kicked Faith off, and shot up off the bed.</P>
<p>"Buffy wait!"</P>
<p>"Oh Willow? No squealing."</P>
<p>Willow ran after Buffy, leaving Faith smiling.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Outside, Buffy was running down the street, and Willow was trying to catch up.</P>
<p>"Buffy! Wait up!"</P>
<p>Buffy stopped abruptly, and turned to face Willow. Tears were streaming down her cheeks.</P>
<p>"I spend an entire night, with Spike, just so I can find you. He’d taken you, and I was so worried about what he might’ve done. I thought you were in danger."</P>
<p>"I was…"</P>
<p>"I’ll have to check my dictionary again, because that sure didn’t look like your typical danger situation."</P>
<p>"I want to…"</P>
<p>"What? Go mess around with Faith? Go ahead, be my guest."</P>
<p>"I don’t want that. At all. I want to…explain."</P>
<p>"Go ahead."</P>
<p>"But…I can’t."</P>
<p>"Do you notice how we’re not making any progress here?"</P>
<p>"You know I would never –"</P>
<p>"Yeah, that’s I thought. Guess I was wrong. Listen, you want to explain, you come get me. Until you do, well, I don’t think there’s anything more to say."</P>
<p>"Please…" Willow was crying now.</P>
<p>"Can you see how hurt I am? And the fact that you can’t even speak to me about what I saw hurts me even more. And the fact that I can’t hate you makes me want to scream. I love you so much it hurts." Buffy said, near sobbing.</P>
<p>She ran off, leaving Willow crying in the street. </P>
<p>"Me too." She whispered.</P>
<P>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Faith watching her. When she turned around, Faith was gone.</P>
