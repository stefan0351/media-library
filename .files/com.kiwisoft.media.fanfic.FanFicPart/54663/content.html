<p>
"Damn, its cold," thought the blond girl shivering on the floor.
Buffy took
another look around at her new surroundings.  The room that she and
Willow
had arrived in was large, easily twice the size of the workroom from
where
they had just left.  Candles and large torches lighted the room.
In
addition, there were four large fireplaces adding their heat and light
to
the room.  Despite all of the fires, the room was cold, barely above
the
freezing mark.  Buffy noticed that they were surrounded by at least
twenty
people standing in a dual circle, all dressed in heavy robes which
had
embroidery similar to the work on her robe.</p>

<p>"Quickly, get some blankets and boots," Amana said, "they will be
freezing
in this temperature."</p>

<p>With that, several things happened simultaneously.  Grael quickly
dispelled
the portal with the words "dorrys skeaylley!"  As other members of the
group
broke the circle, which allowed them to collect several heavy
blankets,
which they proceeded to wrap around the two shivering women who were in
the
centre of the work circle.</p>

<p>"Where are we? Who are you? What's going on? Shadow-Cat, what are you
doing
here?" babbled Willow as she was being wrapped in blankets with thick
fur
boots being shoved onto her feet.</p>

<p>"We will answer all of your questions," Amana replied as she finished
putting the boots on Buffy's feet, "however, we need to get you warm and
fed
first.  Come, we will adjourn to more comfortable surroundings."
She then helped Buffy to her feet and indicated that they should leave
the
room.</p>

<p>The entire group left the workroom and headed back down the corridor to
the
study.  The two travellers were given chairs in front of the fireplace
and
mugs of mulled wine were handed to them.</p>

<p>Two of the group proceeded to drag the table up to the fireplace and
then
had platters of meats, breads, sweets and cheeses placed in front of the
two
women.  In addition, several pitchers of various beverages - ales,
wines and
ciders, were also placed on the table.</p>

<p>"Ok," Willow said a few minutes later, after having drunk half of her
wine
and beginning to feel warm for the first time since arriving.
"Q&amp;A time,
deal us the skinny."</p>

<p>Buffy was eating and drinking thinking to herself "better let Willow
deal
with this, she is better on the witch stuff and she can fill me in
later."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," Grael answered Willow.  "Where do you want to
start?"</p>

<p>"I guess with introductions," Willow continued feeling strangely content
in
this extraordinary company.  "After all," she thought, "they did ask
for my
help, I have no way of getting home without them, so I might as well
deal.</p>

<p>"My name is Willow," she said to the assembled group, "my companion's
name
is Buffy." She continued pointing out the slayer. "The cat that
unexpectedly
also came along is mine and is named Shadow-Cat, I guess she will show
when
she feels like it."</p>

<p>"Welcome, and well met."  Answered Grael.  "My name is Grael, and
this is
Amana," he continued pointing her out.  "We are the leaders of this
group of
mages and are the ones who lead the effort to bring you here to help
us."</p>

<p>"Speaking of here, where are we?" Willow asked looking around closely,
for
the first time, at the room its furnishings and the lighting.  "It
looks
very not modern here."</p>

<p>"Here is not a simple question Willow."  Answered Amana.  "Nor is
when, if I
can anticipate your next question.
"Where we are is in the mage's wing of Castle Maldor.  The castle is
located
in our capital city of Maldorstat. The building is modern in so that we
have
plumbing, heat and a few other conveniences that you are used to,
however,
we do not have mechanical lighting sources."  She continued rising
from the
table and moving towards the other end.  "Frankel here is our most
senior
sage and he will try to give you what we understand is happening." She
said,
standing behind an elderly man who had until that point been sitting
quietly
at the other end of the table.</p>

<p>"The simple answer is that you are still on Earth."  Frankel said,
rising
from the table and taking up the conversation.  "However, it is not
your
Earth, so to speak."</p>

<p>"That's the simple answer?  I'd hate to have a complicated on,"
stated
Buffy, speaking for the first time, and beginning to think that she was
back
in professor Walsh's psychology class.</p>

<p>"It has to do with multiple dimensions and differing realities
between
dimensions." Continued the old sage, beginning to pace around the
room.  "We
have determined that there are several Earths which occupy the same
location, however, they are layered on top of each other creating
different
realities or versions of the same place, your 'Earth' is one such, ours
is
another."</p>

<p>"Okay," replied Willow, "I've read something about this, however, I
didn't
think it was possible."  She was beginning to feel a bit more
comfortable
about what was going on, now that she was starting to receive data.</p>

<p>"Only our great need has made it possible," replied Frankel.  "My
early
researches determined that the 'layers' existed and I was able to
determine
some of the basic characteristics of each."</p>

<p>"Such as?" Prompted Buffy.</p>

<p>"Well, such as the basic geology and atmosphere.  The primary life
forms and
which of them were dominant.  In addition to the general level
of
technology."</p>

<p>"Sounds like you were able to learn a lot," answered Willow.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," the sage continued.  "I was also able to
determine
that there was major differences between the 'layers'.  Essentially,
that
the closer the layers were, the closer the various characteristics
are.
However, once you move significantly away from your home layer the
differences become major."</p>

<p>"How major?" Asked the slayer, convinced now that this guy was a male
psychology professor, all talk and little answers.</p>

<p>"Different biology, life forms, climate and technology to name a few."
He
answered.</p>

<p>"Ok, I can deal with this so-far.  But why us?" Asked Willow.</p>

<p>"I'll answer that in a few minutes," answered Grael, "however, there are
a
couple of points that I would like Frankel to finish up with first."</p>

<p>"Ok then, to finish," the sage continued.  "In my research I
determined that
there were weak points between the layers, which potentially could
allow
communication or transport between them.  Also, it appeared that some
of the
dominant species on some of the layers were able to innately use this
transport ability."  The sage paused to sip from his mug of
wine.  "In fact,
I think that a large amount of what we call 'demons' on our worlds are
in
fact residents of one layer, who have transported to another," he
finished
sitting back down at the table.</p>

<p>"To continue," said Grael, "in our investigations of your world, we
determined that your reality had very few weak points at which demons
and
other evil characters appeared."</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Willow and said quietly, "the hell-mouth."</p>

<p>"We also sensed the great power that resided near one of these
'hell-mouths'
as you call them and hopped that that person would be able to come to
our
assistance, even though they were very poorly trained."  Grael
finished,
looking at Willow optimistically.</p>

<p>"Well, you have answered a number of questions, and raised a few
more,"
Willow said, "however, you still haven't answered why me?"</p>

<p>"That is a bit easier to answer," Amana said.  "For our world has a
very
large number of these hell-mouths, so many in fact that we are in danger
of
being over-run by demons from the other realities."</p>

<p>"These weaknesses have occurred relatively recently," added Grael, "what
we
think is happening is that the demons who are attacking us are able
to
create the weaknesses, or at least expand upon them, and that they have
been
slowly moving from one reality to the next, devastating each in turn.
Since
our world is between them and you, they have not reached your reality in
any
great numbers yet.  However, we believe that once they dispose of us,
you
will eventually be in the line of fire, since there are only about
fifteen
or so worlds between ours and yours."</p>

<p>"And as to why specifically you, Willow," continued Amana, "quite
frankly,
for all of the power that Grael and I have, we are nothing compared to
the
potential power that you will be able to wield."</p>

<p>"But, I'm new at this, I can barely do anything, I don't know very much
and
most of the time I fail."  Willow said plaintively.</p>

<p>"We know this dear," Amana replied, "however, we are excellent teachers
and
we will ensure that you reach your full potential."</p>

<p>"But, what do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Simply, to seal all of the weaknesses between our world and theirs,"
answered Grael.</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to think that details can wait till tomorrow," Amana
said.</p>

<p>"Lets let them finish eating and then we will see about accommodations
for
Willow and her soul-mate."</p>

<p>"Soul-mate."  Buffy exclaimed, "How did you know Willow and I
were
soul-mates?"</p>

<p>"For one that knows how, its easy to see the psychic link between
you."</p>

<p>Amana answered.  "Soon you to will be able to see these things," she
added
cryptically.</p>

<p>"Now, we know your name, but who are you and why did Willow bring
you?"
Amana continued as she quickly changed the subject.</p>

<p>"I'm the slayer." Replied Buffy, and seeing questioning looks from
the
others continued, "don't tell me that you don't have slayers? The
counsel?
General medieval stuffiness' and prophecies?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Grael, "but why don't you fill us in."</p>

<p>"Well, in our reality we have a Watchers Counsel whose job it is to
train
slayers and to provide guidance to them.  In addition, they maintain
records
of various prophecies and other files with respect to demons and other
evil
things."  Buffy continued.</p>

<p>"And," prompted Grael.</p>

<p>"I'm a slayer," answered Buffy.  "I was a chosen one and trained to
fight
demons, particularly vampires.  I have special talents and abilities -
for
example I am able to sense demons, I heal very quickly and I'm very
strong
and fast."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" Responded Frankel becoming very animated, "I've read
about
so-called slayers in our past, however, the last of them was
eliminated
years ago, we must talk about this further."</p>

<p>"Oh, boy," thought Buffy, "not another professor Walsh, worse,
another
Giles."</p>

<p>Willow meanwhile was beginning to yawn, and drowse off.  Amana caught
sight
of this and said.  "Enough for tonight.  Lets get these two off
to their
baths and to bed.  We can finish up our discussions in the
morning."</p>

<p>Amana led Buffy and Willow out of the room and down the hallway.
The
climbed a flight of stairs to another hall, which had a number of doors
off
of it.</p>

<p>"This is where we have our accommodations while we are in the
capital."
Amana said.  "Most of us spend the majority of our time in other
locations,
however, we were all brought together for this project."</p>

<p>"In anticipation of your agreeing to come, we have arranged for you to
have
a room, I trust that you won't mind sharing, since we weren't really
expecting Buffy?" She asked with a smile in her eyes.</p>

<p>She opened one of the doors into a fairly large room.  In fact, it was
a
suite of rooms.  The rooms were all very well lit with several
lanterns in
addition to fireplaces.  The wooden floors were covered in thick
carpets and
thick tapestries covered most of the walls.  Several large windows
were set
into the thick stonewalls and were covered with heavy embroidered
curtains.</p>

<p>"This is your sitting room," stated Amana, "the room to the right is
your
bed-chamber, and the one to the left is the bath."</p>

<p>She continued leading the way to the bathroom that was very well
appointed
with sinks, a toilet and with a very large bathtub.  This bathtub was
easily
the largest that either Buffy or Willow had ever seen.  It was at a
minimum
a metre deep and could easily sit four.  It was set directly into the
floor,
with only the top thirty centimetres or so above the floor line.
Buffy
could see that tilled benches were lining the inside of the tub,
which
raised the possibility of serious lounging time in the tub.  Steam
was
rising from the water.</p>

<p>Amana continued, "the water is very hot, fed by springs deep beneath
the
building, we have lots of it, so we constantly have it circulating
though
the baths so that dirt and grime is carried away and fresh water brought
in.
There is soap, towels and necessities, over here," she said pointing out
a
dressing table and cupboards.</p>

<p>"We will arrange to have clothing sent up to you in the morning, and
there
is plenty of bed linen and warm blankets for tonight already in your
bedchamber."</p>

<p>"Okay then?" she asked, receiving nods in return.  "We will let you
sleep a
bit late, since there is only about five hours till dawn.  I'll come
up to
get you and we will continue with our discussions.</p>

<p>At this point a very satisfied looking grey and white feline walked into
the
room and proceeded to jump up on the table and began to groom
her-self.</p>

<p>"Shadow-Cat," exclaimed Willow.  "Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Meooww!" answered the cat.</p>

<p>"Out exploring I guess," replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"Checking out the resident pest problem probably," Willow agreed.</p>

<p>"Good-night then" replied Amana "I'll see you in the morning."  She
turned
and left the suite, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>As soon as Amana had left, Buffy turned to her friend and lover
saying.</p>

<p>"Witch girl, you've got some serious explaining to do."</p>

<p>"Buffy, I know, but please can it wait till later?"  Willow said as
she went
over to the bath and began to undress in preparation for getting in.</p>

<p>"Okay," the slayer replied, "I'm too tired to worry about it now.
Lets
bathe and get to bed," she continued, removing the blankets that were
wrapped around her body and sitting down to take off the boots.</p>

<p>Soon both women were undressed and in the water sitting on the benches
at
opposite ends of the huge tub.  Buffy looked over at Willow and was
once
again stunned by her beauty, grateful that they had found each other
and
that they had acknowledged their love.  She moved over to the other
woman
and slowly began to caress her neck and shoulders.</p>

<p>"Mmm, that feels nice."  Willow said, sighing and relaxing into the
others
touch.</p>

<p>"Shush don't say anything, just go with the flow."  The slayer
responded as
she began to stimulate Willow's breasts and nipples with the tips of
her
fingers, which immediately began to harden from the slayer's
activities.
Buffy continued performing her special magic on Willow's nipples as she
also
began to kiss the neck and shoulders of her lover.</p>

<p>Willow was beginning to feel the effects of Buffy's touch, and kisses,
deep
inside of her body.  She raised Buffy's head up from her neck and
kissed
her, surrendering her mind and body into the kiss by focusing all of
her
attention to it.  Their tongues duelled together as each women tried
her
hardest to explore the others mouth.</p>

<p>"Bath, soap, wash, we've got to wash." Willow babbled after a few minutes
of
deep kissing.</p>

<p>"Good idea," the other replied, "rubbing soap on soft body parts sounds
like
fun to me."</p>

<p>Willow picked up the bar of soap and quickly created lather, she then
proceeded to gently wash Buffy, making slow gentle motions over her
body,
focusing particular attention to her chest and belly.  Soon she moved
her
hands and the soap lower on Buffy's body, making tentative, darting,
even
teasing moves towards her sex.</p>

<p>"Stop that," Buffy exclaimed, "You are getting me too wet."</p>

<p>"You're in the bath," Willow said quietly as she continued her
assault,</p>

<p>"you're supposed to be wet."</p>

<p>"Then stop teasing me and finish the job." Buffy demanded.</p>

<p>"Your wish is my command," Willow responded and proceeded to move her
hand
between Buffy's legs and began a direct assault on her lover's sex.</p>

<p>Buffy was beginning to break out into a sweat, as she was beginning to
peak
to orgasm and she wanted it to be mutual with Willow.  She
therefore
proceeded to caress Willow's pubic mound, and tentatively massaged her
clit
while inserting a finger deep inside of her.  Buffy was pleased to
discover
that Willow's skin was glowing, more that the hot water alone would
explain
and that her breath was beginning to come in short shallow gasps.</p>

<p>Willow moaned deeply into Buffy's neck.  She had already been at a
high
level of excitement and Buffy's probing fingers deep inside of her
were
beginning to push her over the edge.  Both women continued their
respective
assaults, and within moments, both had powerful simultaneous orgasms.</p>

<p>"Goddess, that is exactly what I needed," panted Willow.  "I trust you
feel
the same lover?"  As she proceeded to embraced her friend in a
hug.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah.  Quite a fine way to relax." Buffy said near breathlessly,
as she
reciprocated the hug, while searching out and finding Willow's mouth
for
another deep passionate kiss.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, the women moved apart.  "Come on love, its been
one
hell of a day," Willow said as she began to wash her hair.  "Let's
finish up
here and get some sleep."</p>

<p>"No problemo," Buffy added as she to began to wash her hair, "I think
tomorrow is going to be even more strange than tonight was."</p>

<p>Within the hour there were two women intertwined on their bed in a
deep
sleep.  Leaping up on the pile of heavy blankets that covered the two
women,
and taking up residence on the pillow behind Willow's head, was a
very
contented cat.</p>

<p>"Purrrrr," came deep from the cat as she thought, "my tummy is full, this
is
not my normal territory, however, my human is here so I am happy."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Elsewhere in the castle, others were not yet sleeping.  Grael,
Amana,
Frankel and a couple of other people were sitting around the long table
in
the study, deep in conversation.</p>

<p>"I think that this is going to work out fine," Grael said to the group,
"She
is young, strong and incredibly powerful."</p>

<p>"I agree," commented Amana.  "She appears to have taken everything
about
tonight's activities well.  No panic and no fits of hysteria."</p>

<p>"The slayer is an unexpected bonus," interjected Frankel.  "Having one
with
her abilities may prove to be the deciding factor."</p>

<p>"That's true," replied Grael, "she also has an unbelievable amount of
strength and power, and if we can link the two together..."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Asked another member of the group.</p>

<p>"Well, it would mean our certain salvation," answered their leader.</p>

<p>"That speculation can wait till later," Amana said as she took up pen
and
paper, "lets confirm what we need to accomplish in the next few
days."</p>

<p>"We need to finish briefing them," answered Grael, "and then we will have
to
assess Willow's training in greater detail.  I think that we will also
want
to begin to train Buffy also."</p>

<p>"But," interjected Frankel, "I want to work with her, get more details
on
slayers, and slaying.  Maybe have her train others."</p>

<p>"I agree with you Frankel," replied Grael, "however, in addition to that
she
is going to need to be trained in her other abilities, certainly not to
the
level of Willow, but she is going to need those skills."</p>

<p>"That is certainly true," continued Amana, "I think that a certain amount
of
cross-training for both of them is in order.  We should arrange to
give
Willow some fighting practice, after all, she will not always have time
for
her magic."</p>

<p>"I hate to interject but," said another member of the group who had
been
silent up to now.  Unlike the others he was dressed in form fitting,
padded,
clothing and had a battle hardened and scarred face.  He was the
garrison
commander for the castle and had primary responsibility for the safety
of
the mages when they were in residence.</p>

<p>"What's that Daithi?" asked Frankel.</p>

<p>"Well, it's just that if we are talking about cross-training and
other
things, we had better use our time wisely."  Daithi replied.</p>

<p>"Why?" Replied Grael.</p>

<p>"My sources have begun to report that the opposition is gathering
strength
and may be poised for a major strike at the capital."</p>

<p>"We will discuss this further tomorrow, Daithi," replied Amana.</p>

<p>"However,
if we want to be able to get anything done in the morning, we have to
get
some sleep in what is left of the night."  And with that, she said
her
goodnights and headed off to her suite.</p>

<p>Other members of the group also decided to turn in, and finishing off
their
various beverages they headed to their respective.  All except
the
commander, who remained behind to have another mug of ale.</p>

<p>"Time," he thought, "how much time do we have before evil falls over
the
land for good?"</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>In a different location, hundreds of kilometres from the activities going
on
in the castle was another stronghold.  Unlike Castle Maldor the
buildings
were shrouded in darkness for no lights were visible from any of the
few
openings that pierced the thick stonewalls.  Inside it was dark
and
unpleasant the temperature matching the sub-zero outside air.
Several
different beings inhabited the building and none were overtly friendly
to
humankind.</p>

<p>Suddenly the atmosphere was punctured by a blood-curdling scream.
"What in the name of the Chaos Gods do you mean you don't know?"
Striding down a corridor was an immense figure, with blood red skin,
yellow
eyes and sporting three horns.  It turned towards another being, which
was
practically running to keep up, and continued.</p>

<p>"I told you to find out what those blighted mages were up to.  You
know that
my ability to see inside of that damned castle is very inadequate at
the
best of times and now that all of them are in residence it is totally
impossible."</p>

<p>"I know master," the other creature replied.  This one appeared to be
a
human male of middle age.  "But nothing I've done is generating
answers."</p>

<p>"I don't care who or what you have to maim, torture, kidnap or kill -
but
find me the answers, and find them fast." The master said punctuating
its
statements with pointed jabs from its claw tipped fingers.  "Or else
I'll be
using your entrails to do my divining."  With that, the demon turned
and
left the corridor through a nearby door.</p>

<p>The humanoid shivered to his bones thinking to himself, "I've got to
get
some answers, or get out of here."</p>

<p>Turing around he spotted a small, green frog like figure and yelled
out,</p>

<p>"Kratel, get your webbed feet over here now!"</p>

<p>"Yes, master," the small imp like creature replied.</p>

<p>"You heard our terrible master.  I need answers, but fast." The
humanoid
continued as he and the imp returned back down the passageway.
"Put
together a raiding party, five or so in addition to yourself, and get
into
that accursed castle and get me a couple of victims so that I can
torture
some answers out of them."</p>

<p>"We will depart at once master," answered the imp.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy woke the next morning at her usual time of just before dawn
thinking
to herself, "damn, not even in the same reality and my slayer senses
still
get me up at dawn."  She realized that she was entangled with Willow
with
their arms and legs intertwined.  Feeling a warm spot above Willow's
head
she though "well, Shadow-Cat must be off looking for her breakfast, I
guess
I had better get my day going."  Moving slowly and carefully so not to
wake
her lover she got out of bed, only to realize that other than her
ritual
robe and some blankets, she still did not have anything to wear.  It
was
cold in the room, but not freezing, obviously someone had been in to
re-build the fires.
"Oh, well," the slayer thought, "It's not as if Willow hasn't seen me
naked
before, and I certainly don't want to wear my robe to do my
exercises."</p>

<p>Buffy went into the sitting room and spotted an agitated cat reaching up
and
scratching at the door.
"You want out, don't you girl?  Buffy asked as she opened the
door.
Shadow-Cat meowed back to the slayer and bolted out of the room.  "We
are
going to have to arrange for a cat-door and other kitty things if we
are
here much longer," thought Buffy.</p>

<p>After quickly creating a free space in the room, by moving carpets away
from
the floor, Buffy began her morning routine.  She spent a dozen minutes
doing
careful warm-up exercises and then spent about twenty minutes stretching
out
her muscles.  Once she had warmed-up properly, and having done the
required
stretching, she moved into the serious portion of her morning
workout.
Buffy, having had no formal, early, slayer training did not use the
council's particular workout routine, rather she used a combination
of
Aikido and Karate katas which she and Giles had augmented to suit her
particular requirements.  After twenty minutes or so she was beginning
to
feel relaxed and the sweat was beginning to run off of her body.
Earlier,
while doing her warm-up, Buffy had noticed an old broom by the door,
which
she had used for several of her stretching routines.  She now broke
off a
four-foot section of it while thinking, "this will do until I find a
replacement."  With that, she then launched into a series of Kendo
exercises
concentrating on her thrusting attacks and her defensive speed.</p>

<p>Buffy was being watched.  Willow had woken up shortly after Buffy
had
started her katas and was enjoying watching the slightly erotic display of
a
nude slayer exercising which was being put on for her benefit, even
though
un-knowingly.  In fact, she was beginning to become just a wee bit
aroused
by the display.</p>

<p>Willow was familiar with Buffy's routine, having watched it several
times,
albeit with a fully clothed slayer.  Just as Buffy was finishing up
the last
of her Kendo routines she said, "Meow, that looks yummy."</p>

<p>"What?" Exclaimed the startled slayer. "Will, I thought you were
still
asleep.  Just how long have you been watching me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about thirty minutes or so," Willow said smiling.  "I would never
dream
of disturbing you at your exercise," she continued with an impish
grin.</p>

<p>"And may I assume that you received no, vicarious, pleasure from watching
my
activities?"  Buffy asked as she grabbed a towel and headed back into
the
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Who, me?" Answered Willow trying her best to look innocent.</p>

<p>"Up now, slouch," Buffy said as she proceeded to pull the blankets off
the
protesting occupant.</p>

<p>"No, too cold, you come back to bed," protested the redhead.</p>

<p>"Nope, sloth-girl," Buffy answered, as she continued her assault on
the
blankets, "time to rise, shine and bathe.  If you are lucky and ask
nice, I
just might let you wash my back though," she said as she left the
room
heading for the bath.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody, may I please," said Willow, as she jumped out of bed.</p>

<p>"Oh,
cold, goosy bumpies," she yelped and quickly ran to grab some of the
blankets from the night before.</p>

<p>"Morning love," the hacker said as she moved into the bathroom and
hugged
the slayer from behind as she was in the process of gathering the soap
and
shampoo for their bath.</p>

<p>"Sleep well?" she asked as she tuned Buffy around so that she would be
able
to snag her good-morning kiss.</p>

<p>"Yep, how about you," the slayer replied returning, with vigour, the
kiss.</p>

<p>"Not bad, weird dreams, though," Willow replied testing the water,</p>

<p>"Oh,
goody-goody, hot," and proceeded to jump into the bath.</p>

<p>"What do you mean weird?" Asked a suddenly concerned slayer, as she
to
entered the water.</p>

<p>"Well, just strange images, and vague uneasy feelings, like I've
experienced
this reality before or something," Willow answered as she began to get
to
work with soap.  "Turn around Buff, you promised me back."</p>

<p>Buffy complied with the mock order from Willow saying, "well I didn't
exactly promise, but you have been good."</p>

<p>"How good?" Bantered the redhead.</p>

<p>"Very."  Replied Buffy, "By the way," the blond continued, "you know
that
what you did last night was nuts, right?"</p>

<p>Willow said nothing as she continued to wash Buffy's back.</p>

<p>"I mean, off you go - dragging me and a cat with you, into an unknown
portal
in the middle of a ritual, answering no questions."</p>

<p>"Hey, I didn't mean to bring the cat," Willow responded, "and, I had no
real
choice Buffy, I'm supposed to help those who ask.  I'm almost
compelled to
go."</p>

<p>"Okay, its all water under the bridge anyway," the slayer replied, "I
just
hope that these folks can get us home."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think so," Willow replied, "besides, I'm dieing to see what
Giles's
reaction was."</p>

<p>"Well, I can guarantee, whatever his reaction, he wasn't speechless."
Answered Buffy.</p>

<p>The two women spent the next few minutes washing themselves, and each
other.</p>

<p>Things were just beginning to heat up from their activities when they
heard
a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>"Damn," Willow said extracting her hands from several of Buffy's
sensitive
spots, "just when things were starting to get interesting."</p>

<p>"Come-in," she yelled to the door giving Buffy a quick kiss as she left
the
tub and grabbed a towel.
She turned to her lover and said. "We will definitely finish this
later."</p>

<p>Willow went into the sitting room to great Amana and two other women who
had
arrived with several items.  Principle amongst them was several items
of
clothing.</p>

<p>"I hope you slept well," asked the mage.  "I trust you are rested and
are
ready for what looks to be a very busy day."  She continued as she and
the
other ladies laid out the several items of clothing.</p>

<p>"We have brought several items of clothing for you," she continued
pointing
out the robes, dresses and other apparel.  "We have also brought
under-clothing and other toiletries for the two of you."</p>

<p>"Thank-you," replied Willow as she proceeded to look over the various
items
of underwear and finding that all of the items were in their sizes.</p>

<p>"I think however, that Buffy is going to need clothing that isn't a
dress,"
she continued not seeing anything resembling pants in the pile.</p>

<p>"We know," replied Amana, "however, since I understand that Buffy will
need
to be fitted for armour, albeit leather armour, she can wear the
clothes
that we have brought here in the meantime."</p>

<p>"These will be fine," said the slayer as she emerged from the bathroom
with
a towel wrapped around her body.  "Just so long as the clothes are
warm,
I'll be happy," she continued joining Willow in choosing appropriate
underwear and other garments.</p>

<p>"Wait," Amana said, as the two travellers were starting to dress, by
dropping their towels, figuring that modesty was definitely going to
lose
out to warmth, "I have brought Aiofe and Bridie along to be your
assistants."  Amana said as she pointed out the two other women.
Aiofe was
tall and dark-haired, while her companion was a little shorter than
Willow.
Both women had pale complexions and deep jade-green eyes.</p>

<p>"But, we don't need help to dress," Willow complained.  "After all we
have
been doing it ourselves since we were small."</p>

<p>"It's not that you need help dear," explained Amana, "its just that
two
persons as powerful as you and Buffy are required to have assistance as
part
of your station in our society.  Others you will come in contact with
will
not give you the respect that you deserve if you do not have the symbols
of
your rank and position."</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed Buffy as Bridie began to help her to dress, with
Aiofe
performing the same task for Willow.  "Will they cut our food and help
us to
eat also?"</p>

<p>"No, that they won't do," replied Amana with a smile in her eyes,</p>

<p>"however,
they will serve your food and keep your suite tidy."</p>

<p>"That will help," replied Willow as she tried to come to grips with
the
situation.</p>

<p>Within minutes, the two women were dressed and were heading out of
their
suite.  Amana led them down two flights of stairs to a large room,
which was
obviously a dining hall.  Like the other rooms in the castle it
had
stonewalls.  Several heavy oak beams spanned the hall, forming the
support
structure for the roof.  The floors were thick pegged oak boards, and
there
were a number of chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p>"This is where we will break our fast," she said leading them to
three
chairs.  "After we have eaten we will retire back to the study and
continue
our conversation of last night."</p>

<p>The serving girls with several platters of fresh fruit, breads,
cheeses,
yoghurts and beverages, quickly filled the table in front of them.
The
three women quickly fell to eating.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Later they returned to the study area, which had already begun to fill
with
the other mages.  The women took the same places that they had the
night
before. After allowing everyone time to greet each other, Grael stood up
to
continue the discussions from the previous night.</p>

<p>"I trust that you will want to know what we have planned," he said
starting
the conversation.  "We have gone ahead and made some preliminary
plans,
which we will discuss with you, however, I would prefer to continue
discussing our present situation first."</p>

<p>"That sounds ok to me," replied Willow, "I do have a number of
questions."</p>

<p>"Well, ask away."</p>

<p>"Okay, first, why is it so cold, second, why do you speak English, and
third
what gives with the weird technology level?" Willow continued. "I mean
you
have plumbing, some heating and very fine textile weaving, but no
electricity or mechanical devices."</p>

<p>"The answers to your questions are all related to the same cause, and
will
sum up the background left out last night," answered Grael.  "It has
to do
with the differences between your world and ours, and the impact that
the
flood of demons has had on our world."</p>

<p>Frankel then took up the conversation, "we have studied, as best we
could,
your world.  It would appear that for the most part our world followed
yours
in societal and scientific development up until a hundred or so years
ago.
For example, we had the same Judeo-Christian influence, the Middle Ages,
the
reformation and the beginnings of the industrialized era.  We
also
experienced the same waves of exploration."</p>

<p>"What happened then?" Asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Two things," answered the sage.  "First, we entered into a mini-ice
age due
to a series of massive volcanic eruptions, and second we began to
experience
the increased demon activity.  We are still not entirely convinced
that the
two events are not related, since the demons do appear to love the
results
of the cold," he continued, as he once again got up from the table and
began
to pace around the room.</p>

<p>"Both of these events had an immediate retardation effect on our
scientific
progress, in addition to massive bouts of war, famine and social
upheaval.
As a result we are approximately a century behind your world," he
concluded,
staring out of a window.</p>

<p>"Well, that does answer my questions," replied Willow.  "I do have one
other
before you go on with your agenda."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Asked Amana.</p>

<p>"Why is magic apparently more advanced here?" asked the redhead.</p>

<p>"In part due to the upheavals we talked about," answered Amana, "we
have
been required to develop other methods to deal with our problems and
with
the demon plagues, however, we have now come to the end of our
resources."</p>

<p>"Hence our need for you," concluded Grael.</p>

<p>"Okay, then," said the slayer, "what are your plans for us then?"</p>

<p>"Right, down to business," replied Grael.
"First, we would like for both of you to be fully assessed in your
magical
talents," continued Amana, "then, we are going to arrange for you to
be
outfitted and appraised in your fighting skills Buffy."</p>

<p>"We would then like to take some time to have additional talks with the
two
of you on slayers and slaying," interjected Frankel, continuing his
personal
agenda.</p>

<p>"That will probably take most of today," added Grael, "then, over the
next
few days we will start to train the two of you."</p>

<p>"Heavy workload," commented Buffy.</p>

<p>"At least it will keep us busy," replied Willow, "in fact, sounds like
fun."</p>

<p>"We will also be training you in several Martial arts Willow so that
you
will be able to protect yourself when you don't have time for magic,"
added
Amana.</p>

<p>"Oh, boy," exclaimed Buffy, "sweaty witch-girl, I love it."</p>

<p>"Alright then," said Grael, "lets get down to work."</p>

<p>Just then, Buffy felt a familiar unpleasant cramping in her loins.
She
turned to Willow saying, "Will, watch-out, my spidey sense is
tingling!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the door to the study area burst open and six demons burst in,
with
the leader, a green imp like creature yelling, "Ok - scum, now we are
going
to get some answers!"</p>
