<!-- Who Am I? \ Revelations (Or - Steer You Around The Curves) -->

<p>The Bronze was a place of raging hormones.
That was a fact nobody would deny. But this particular night, the hormone
levels were just the slightest bit higher than normal. Anyone who was watching
would say the levels were more like astronomically higher, and depending
on the varying reactions of the onlookers, they'd probably be right. They
didn't make it obvious they were looking, but the people their gazes were
fixed on, knew.</p>
<p>And they didn't give a damn.</p>
<p>The girls, who were the center of everyone's
attention, didn't stop from one dance to the next. They just kept going,
like they were performing a never-ending ballet. And a highly provocative
one at that. Blonde matched brown, neither leading nor succumbing. Both
very independent, very equal partners in what they were doing. Yes, partners.
That's what they were. Moving beat for beat in synchronized motions. All
they lived for was the moment. An infinite stretch of time that ended only
when they said so.</p>
<p>As a new song began, without thinking,
they changed their pattern to keep with the tempo. It's pulsing beat signified
that it was a quickly paced song, but slow enough for the girls to still
maintain the sensual, intimate, closeness of their gyrations, which they
weren't about to give up. The blonde raised her arms above her head, which
were met by the delicate, yet firm pair of hands belonging to her companion.</p>
<p>"Last one, B." Faith whispered.</p>
<p>"Let's go out with a bang then." Buffy
said, raw passion in her voice.</p>
<p>"I love you."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>Faith guided Buffy's arms behind her neck,
and Buffy held on as the vocals began.</p>
<p><i>This is our game and we have control,</i></p>
<p><i>We make the moves and we make the rules,</i></p>
<p><i>But maybe we're just being fooled</i></p>
<p><i>In a sea of chance we wound up together</i></p>
<p><i>Never really questioned where we found
ourselves</i></p>
<p><i>Never really wondered about forever</i></p>
<p>Buffy pushed back into Faith as the dark-haired
slayer slid her hands down Buffy's arms, and continued down her body, each
hand moving slowly down the blonde's sides. When Faith felt that she reached
the waist, she brought her arms around the front, her hands meeting and
fingers interlocking. She pulled Buffy back, further into her.</p>
<p><i>Are we just pawns moving at life's pace?</i></p>
<p><i>Under the illusion that this is our
race?</i></p>
<p><i>Is the struggle really worth the reward
at the end?</i></p>
<p>Faith closed her eyes as she felt Buffy's
hands run through her hair. The petite slayer was able to reach her hands
over Faith's head, and lay her hands atop hers. Faith bent her head, smelling
Buffy's hair, her skin, inhaling the scent. She brought her lips to the
soft flesh just below her ear, and nipped. She had a small grin as she
heard Buffy's intake of breath.</p>
<p><i>Before you came my foundations were
solid,</i></p>
<p><i>Limits tested and boundaries set,</i></p>
<p><i>Other side and I had never met</i></p>
<p><i>You appeared and reality distorted,</i></p>
<p><i>The game's rules were aborted,</i></p>
<p><i>Got to see beyond my sphere</i></p>
<p>Buffy began to turn to face her, and Faith
widened her arms just enough. Body brushed against body, their hips never
slowing once. They began to move a few steps, and people cleared a path.
In an unexpected move that caught Buffy off-guard for a second, Faith released
her loose hold, and began to circle Buffy closely, eyes locked on hers.</p>
<p><i>Are we just pawns moving at life's pace?</i></p>
<p><i>Under the illusion that this is our
race?</i></p>
<p><i>Is the struggle really worth the reward
at the end?</i></p>
<p>Faith wasn't getting off that easy. Buffy
matched her movements, and stopped Faith in the middle of a step. She reached
for hand, took it, and pulled Faith to her. She pecked at Faith's Harlet-covered
bottom lip, and grinned. She brought her knee between Faith's legs, and
then the Bostonian took her turn and wrapped her arms around Buffy's neck
as they continued to dance.</p>
<p><i>It's not good to be too bad and bad
to be too good,</i></p>
<p><i>Separate we can't find that even ground,</i></p>
<p><i>Maybe together we could</i></p>
<p><i>Don't know when you became my lifeline,</i></p>
<p><i>From the walls I let confine,</i></p>
<p><i>But we're the game's key players now</i></p>
<p>The song was slowing now, and so were
they.</p>
<p>"Jesus…" Faith exhaled.</p>
<p>"Think we were entertaining enough?"</p>
<p>"I know I was satisfied."</p>
<p>"Were you?"</p>
<p>They separated slowly, hands losing contact
at the last possible second. And then in a bold move, not caring who was
around, Faith captured Buffy's mouth with hers. Buffy, shocked as she was,
couldn't deny her partner this. Couldn't deny herself this. It only lasted
all but three seconds, but time was a relative thing. And it confirmed
to the both of them that they were still in reality.</p>
<p><i>We are one in the sea</i></p>
<p><i>Are we just pawns moving at life's pace?</i></p>
<p><i>Under the illusion that this is our
race?</i></p>
<p><i>Is the struggle really worth the reward
at the end?</i></p>
<p>The song over, they stared at the people
who had been watching. The two of them dared anyone to say a word. No one
did. As they moved back over to their table, the noise level resumed its
normal volume, and time moved forward once again.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back at the table, Willow and Tara were
trying to get their jaws to work again. The phrase "you're face will get
stuck that way" was becoming less and less of an old wives' tale by the
second. Watching Buffy and Faith, among other things, made them feel a
little guilty. Even though they allowed the whole Bronze to view them.
What the slayers did, they couldn't think of an
 appropriate term, seemed very personal.</p>
<p>Willow stared down at her soda, and then
up at Tara.</p>
<p>"Soda doesn't seem like the best idea right
now." Tara nodded in agreement. "How's water sound?"</p>
<p>"Good...throat's a little dry…"</p>
<p>Willow began to get up. "Yeah…I'll make
sure it's cold."</p>
<p>"To cool down."</p>
<p>"Right. Cause it's hot in here." They both
looked around nervously, and then Willow walked over to the bar.</p>
<p>Tara looked up as Buffy and Faith approached
the table, and despite her previous embarrassment, had to crack a small
smile. It was obvious the girls had enjoyed themselves. Faith sat on the
empty stool, and Buffy sat on her knee. She could see the love, but they
weren't the kind of couple that went out of their way to show people they
were in love.</p>
<p>Well, under normal circumstances. Which
was anywhere but dance floors.</p>
<p>They seemed so comfortable with their relationship.
People's opinions, gazes, didn't seem to affect them. Tara guessed it was
because they didn't really have time to worry about what people thought.
And they didn't seem like the type of people to care anyhow. She wished
she and Willow could do that. Well, their relationship wasn't very clearly
defined at the moment, so Tara supposed she was jumping the gun a little
bit.</p>
<p>"I've…uh…never seen anything like that
before." Tara said slowly.</p>
<p>"Did we look really stupid or something?"
Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I think she means…" Faith whispered Buffy
the rest.</p>
<p>"Oh." Buffy blushed, and then grinned.
"I don't think anybody in here has."</p>
<p>"You and Will should get those plevis'
movin'." Faith said.</p>
<p>"Well…I uh…I don't think so." Tara said,
face red.</p>
<p>"Why not? Don't tell me she's still being
-"</p>
<p>"Sssh!" Buddy shushed Faith as Willow came
back with four water bottles.</p>
<p>The redhead handed the three of them each
a bottle, and sat down on her stool. As much as they tried to hide it,
she knew what they all wanted her to do. It had been about a week since
she and Faith had had their talk, and she hadn't been able to work up the
guts to just flat out kiss Tara. She wanted there to be a moment, a right
time. But if she didn't think of Tara in a romantic way, there would be
no need for a "right moment" in the first place. She was so confused.</p>
<p>"Do you two have any energy left?" Willow
asked.</p>
<p>Buffy took a swig of her water. "We're
the real-life Energizer Bunnies. Only…without the fir. And the drums."</p>
<p>"Where do you come up with these analogies?
Are you in the special class on campus or something?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you knew 'analogy' was
a word. Let alone use it appropriately in a sentence." Buffy retorted.</p>
<p>"Touch&eacute;." Faith conceded.</p>
<p>Willow and Tara exchanged glances as they
watched the exchange of jibes. The glance turned into a look, the look
turned into a gaze, and the gaze became a staring contest. But nobody was
going to win. When they mutually broke off eye contact, they saw their
friends staring at them with knowing smiles.</p>
<p>Buffy moved off of Faith, and they both
looked at the girls, rather focused glints in their eyes. The wiccans were
scared, too scared to move. Buffy got behind Willow, and Faith got behind
Tara.</p>
<p>"This for your own good ladies." Faith
said. "Coulda done it the easy way, but you just had to let it drag. Time
to get things on track."</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Trust me, Will. We just wanna see you
happy." Buffy said, holding her friend by the shoulders.</p>
<p>"What are you talking ab -" Tara started,
but got cut off as Faith gave her a little nudge.</p>
<p>But a little nudge from a slayer was like
a decent shove from a 'normal' person, so Tara lost her balance and fell
forward off the stool. Willow caught her before she hit the ground, and
she smiled at the redhead. Buffy moved away from Willow, and all Tara could
hear was the other witch's breathing.</p>
<p>For Willow, as she still grasped Tara's
arms, she felt a sensation shoot through her body. The blonde's smile,
her eyes, her soft voice, it all hit her like a freight train. And even
though they ended up in their current position rather unceremoniously,
and it wasn't the most private place in the world, this was the moment.</p>
<p>The time when everything finally made sense
to her. She felt it when they first met, and whenever they were together.
She recognized the love she had let stay hidden, and now it just wanted
to explode out. But she couldn't. Not here. Not in the Bronze. Not...</p>
<p>"Damn it, Red. Kiss her already." Faith
said.</p>
<p>"You…you…don't…have -" Tara said, not believing
this was happening.</p>
<p>"Only one way to find out, right?" Willow
asked in a hushed tone.</p>
<p>Willow leaned down and kissed Tara's lips
softly, tentatively, not sure what to expect. Tara's mouth parted, her
breath mixing with Willow's. This continued into short, soft kisses along
the contours of each other's mouths.</p>
<p>"I…um…guys…you might wanna…" Buffy urged
gently, looking toward the entrance.</p>
<p>"Wrap it up." Faith said more forcefully.</p>
<p>But by the time they did, it was too late.</p>
<p>"Huh? What…" Willow trailed off as she
went wide-eyed.</p>
<p>"Look, it's the X-Man and his girl." Faith
said.</p>
<p>"Hey." Xander said slowly.</p>
<p>Anya simply smirked. "What'd we miss?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Let's play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire!"
Regis' voice projected from the TV.</p>
<p>Giles enjoyed the American version much
better than the one he had seen on his infrequent trips to London. The
contestants in the show overseas were always nervous, shy and fidgety from
what he saw. But in the American version, the contestants told you their
life story. It was rather amusing. Plus it was more fun to yell it them
if they got it wrong.</p>
<p>"What band has a member who is most recognizable
by the size of his lips?</p>
<p>"Is it:</p>
<p>"A: The Beatles?</p>
<p>"B: The Monkees</p>
<p>"C: The Backstreet Boys</p>
<p>"Or D: The Rolling Stones?"</p>
<p>Even though the contestant was a computer
programmer from California with a pocket protector, he had to know the
answer. Everyone knew the answer. It was so obvious.</p>
<p>"Hmmm…I was thinking Steven Tyler…but Aerosmith's
not up there…and I remember the Monkees…their lips all seemed pretty regular…I
never was really into the Beatles craze…and…" The contestant rambled on.</p>
<p>"Come on! Pillock! It's the hundred dollar
question for God's sake!" Giles said trying to repress his rage.</p>
<p>"I've never…I mean I hear the Stones a
lot on the radio…"</p>
<p>"Oh they allow radios in the cubicles?"
Regis joked, deadpan.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to ask the audience."</p>
<p>The phone began to ring. "Ask the audience?
Bloody moron. Never heard of Mick Jagger, have you? Americans."</p>
<p>As Giles picked up the phone, he heard
Regis speak again.</p>
<p>"There you go. One hundred percent of the
audience thinks D is the right answer. I don't think we've ever had unanimous
agreement on this show before."</p>
<p>"I'll have to go with D as my final answer
then."</p>
<p>"You better. There's no chance in hell
you're getting up to -" Giles started, but then got cut off by Olivia's
frantic voice on the
 other end of the line. "Olivia? What's
the matter?"</p>
<p>"I came home from a friend's flat about
thirty minutes ago and…"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"There were men from that Council you told
me about at my door. They just left."</p>
<p>Giles paled. "What did they want?"</p>
<p>"They asked me questions about a Faith
person. And I remembered her from when I was over there last and I guess
they must have followed me…I told them she was staying with you. I didn't
think much of it until I overheard them say…"</p>
<p>He slid his glasses off his face and closed
his eyes. "It's not your fault. I should have informed you better."</p>
<p>"I'm the one who didn't want to know about
slayers and hellmouths…what did I do, Ripper?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. It'll be fine. Now did they say
when they might arrive here?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow night I think. Your time."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I'll call you as soon as I
can." He hung up. "They don't know when to give up."</p>
<p>Faith and Buffy had to come by. Faith lived
there after all. He just hoped it was sooner rather than later.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Ah…what do you say we go for a walk?"
Buffy asked, trying to find some way to break the tension. "As much as
I like public displays, I think we've all given the Bronze enough of a
show tonight."</p>
<p>"Agreed." Faith said, but still shot a
suggestive leer Buffy's way for good measure.</p>
<p>"Yeah…good idea." Willow and Tara said
quickly, standing up.</p>
<p>The four girls led the way out, getting
as far ahead of Xander and Anya as possible. Xander followed with his ex-demon
 girlfriend, staying silent all the way
out the door.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. We missed something big." Anya
said, pleased with her previous deduction.</p>
<p>The silence was creepy. They walked along
the sidewalk, leaving the bad side of town, and nobody spoke. It was like
waiting for a bomb to tick down its seconds before it exploded. You knew
it was going to happen, but you also knew you wouldn't be ready for it.
They all risked looks in Xander's direction to see how far away he was
from blowing up. There was a vein protruding from his forehead, but that's
all they could make out.</p>
<p>On autopilot, they all seemed to be moving
in the direction of Giles' house. They walked down Main Street, looking
at the various stores, afraid to say a word. Past the Expresso Pump, past
April Fools, the quiet was killing them. Xander looked at Willow and Tara
out of the corner of his eye, and then focused in front of him once again.</p>
<p>"So have you interlocked yet or what?"
Anya asked, frustrated.</p>
<p>"Depends on your definition." Faith remarked,
as Buffy tried to glare at her.</p>
<p>Now Xander stopped walking, and faced the
slayers. He had only seen Willow and Tara. And as if that wasn't…bad
 enough…now the other two were…</p>
<p>"You too?" He asked in a low tone.</p>
<p>"Yeah. We've all been infected by an evil
lesbian succubus, and we're all under a freaky spell that's overpowered
us with lesbian vibes." Buffy deadpanned.</p>
<p>Xander actually looked relieved for a second.
Until Anya slapped him on the arm.</p>
<p>"It's called sarcasm. Even I know that."</p>
<p>"Why?" He asked now, his relief faded.</p>
<p>"Think he could have picked a more complicated
question?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Well, we said we'd do it together, right
Will?" Buffy asked her friend. "That is…if you guys are…"</p>
<p>Willow forgot about Xander for the moment,
and looked at Tara. "I think we are. We are, right?"</p>
<p>Tara nodded repeatedly; still unable to
believe she had kissed Willow.</p>
<p>"Okay. Will somebody please explain what
the hell is going on?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Better question. Why the hell are we even
bothering to get his approval?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Is that what we're trying to do?" Willow
asked. She couldn't really focus.</p>
<p>"Spike." Buffy said quickly.</p>
<p>"And the award for 'Making an already awkward
situation even more confusing' goes to…" Xander trailed off.</p>
<p>"No. Spike. Coming out of the liquor store."</p>
<p>Faith looked to where Buffy was pointing.
The Xander conversation was going nowhere fast. She needed a distraction.</p>
<p>"Wanna go play?" Faith questioned her slaying
partner.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Xander. She wasn't quite
ready to discuss the whole thing. Especially not on the street. She looked
at Faith, and the brown-haired slayer handed her a stake. "Let's do it."</p>
<p>Xander choked as the slayers went to surprise
the blonde vampire.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Two commandos moved along the alleys, keeping
tabs on the two slayers. They watched the stealthy movements of the girls,
as they sneaked closer to what appeared to be Hostile Seventeen. There
was no love lost between the Initiative members and their targets that
was for sure. They had started the deterioration of the well-oiled machine
that was their job, and the threats had to be dealt with.</p>
<p>The two men were not in any real authoritative
position, they were just the stooges, but they made sure Graham and the
higher ups knew their feelings on ‘the Slayer Matter’. They had their orders,
and were simply waiting to execute their part of the operation. The vampire
was not a variable they had anticipated, however. Jackson was calling the
shots on this mission, and figured he had better call the base for instructions.</p>
<p>"Sir, the targets are moving to intercept
Hostile Seventeen. Should we alter the plan to compensate for him?"</p>
<p>Graham’s voice crackled through Jackson’s
headset. "Deactivating his implant was a mistake. If you can take him without
compromising the main objective, do it. Use your best judgement."</p>
<p>"The way things look now, the slayers may
get hold of him."</p>
<p>"Then drive them all to the team. It’ll
be good field exercise for the new asset."</p>
<p>"Copy that. Jackson out."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike didn’t have time to react as Buffy
and Faith shoved him up against a building. Miraculously, he still managed
to hold onto the brown paper bag, which held his newly purchased bottle
of vodka. When Buffy realized that they were still in plain view of passersby,
they dragged him around the corner and into an alley.</p>
<p>Faith applied pressure to his neck with
her forearm.</p>
<p>"Hiya, Billy."</p>
<p>Buffy snatched the bag from his hand. "Tsk,
tsk, Spike. This stuff’ll eat away at your liver, you know. And then it’ll
kill ya." She tossed it to the ground, and the bottle shattered inside
the bag. "If you weren’t already technically dead, that is."</p>
<p>"Aww, come on. I haven’t tried to kill
you bitches for a week and a half." Buffy slugged him, and his head hit
the wall.</p>
<p>"Hey, he’s right, B. So whatcha been doing
with yourself? Besides getting trashed off your ass."</p>
<p>"Making friends." He said.</p>
<p>"That’s…okay what’s the deal? Who’s the
friend?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Like I’d tell you. And don’t threaten
me with that ‘we’ll dust you’ line. You’re gonna do it anyway. I’ve got
nothing to gain."</p>
<p>"All right. We’ll just kill you then."
Faith said, looking to Buffy for confirmation.</p>
<p>Buffy pulled back her stake.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Spike yelled.</p>
<p>"You wanna spill now?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"No…it's just…isn't that two of those soldier
boys looking this way?"</p>
<p>The slayers turned their heads, and there
were indeed two soldiers looking their way. As soon as they saw that they
had been spotted, the men ran off.</p>
<p>"There's something not right about this…"
Buffy trailed off.</p>
<p>"Well, let's go say hello. We'll just bring
'Mr. Black Wedding' with us." Faith said, easing the force she was applying
on Spike a little. "If there's trouble, we can use him as a shield."</p>
<p>"You know, my new friend has also been
helping me get back into shape." Spike said, pushing Faith back, and then
connecting with her jaw.</p>
<p>He made it past Buffy, but the blonde was
quickly on him, tackling him to the ground. "Need a little more work."
Buffy said, pinning his arms behind him.</p>
<p>Faith recovered and started walking down
the other end of the alley where they had seen the commandos. "I'll follow
'em. Just catch up." She started to speed up.</p>
<p>Before Buffy could object, Faith was already
going at a good pace.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>"Do I have a choice?" Spike asked.</p>
<p>"Shut up."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith ran and ran, following the commandos
into "Three Graves Cemetery" as she dubbed it. She called it that in all
seriousness because there were three graves where the deceased had actually
stayed in their final resting places. They all happened to be children
too. She heard that they had died from mysterious blood loss that, shockingly,
showed her that vampires did have some standards when it came to turning
their victims.</p>
<p>That really wasn't her biggest concern
at the moment, however. She had lost sight of the man she pursued into
the place. She had to hand it to them, though, because when the Initiative
guys wanted to hide, they could hide. And she didn't really want to admit
it to herself, but she had a feeling chasing after them had been a bad
idea.</p>
<p>Scanning the graves, her eyes rested on
a mausoleum. She could see a silouhette in the moonlight. Whoever it was,
they were standing in the entryway, and if this was a trap, she wasn't
going to go into a dark, dank space and wait to be ambushed.</p>
<p>"Show yourself. I've got places to be."</p>
<p>The person stepped forward slowly, and
met Faith halfway. When she got a good look, she gasped. The man was in
normal commando fatigues, looked normal, though bigger.</p>
<p>"Riley?"</p>
<p>"Where have you got to go?"</p>
<p>"You're dead."</p>
<p>"Am I?"</p>
<p>"Getting shot through the heart usually
qualifies you as dead in my book." She started to back away as he got closer.</p>
<p>"You're Faith."</p>
<p>"Thanks for clearing that up."</p>
<p>"If I remember, yes…I was gone, and you
had a hand in it."</p>
<p>"You can't be a vamp…" Riley reached out
his hand, and a stiletto shot from his wrist. "Holy shit." Faith whispered.</p>
<p>That's when she heard Buffy and Spike coming
running up behind her.</p>
<p>"Faith…what…" Buffy saw Riley, and she
stiffened. "What the hell…"</p>
<p>Spike noticed the stiletto before Buffy
did. "Meet the new and improved model. He looks less thrown together than
the other one."</p>
<p>"Oh my God…"</p>
<p>That's when a full team of commandos stood
up from behind graves, dropped from trees, and formed a circle around Buffy,
Faith, Spike and Riley. They pointed their weapons at the slayers and the
vampire, and Riley, receiving orders, began to advance.</p>
