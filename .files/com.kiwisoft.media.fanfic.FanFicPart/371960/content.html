<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter 4</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lilly nearly choked at Miley's words and stared at her new friend in disbelief. Had she just imagined Miley's request? Was she going delusional with hunger? But the look on Miley's face told her she hadn't been dreaming. Lilly had no idea how to respond and it took long enough for her to even think of anything Miley became restless and looked away.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Lilly. I shouldn't have asked. I know we just met…and you're probably freaked out by the whole pregnant thing and…you don't think of me that way…I just wanted to see if…if there were sparks…if I'm gay, y'know."</p>
<p>Lilly wanted to smack herself for causing the self-doubt in the beautiful girl's voice and what she thought were the beginnings of tears. She immediately got up and knelt in front of Miley, who wouldn't meet her eyes. Lilly took a deep breath, trying to keep her emotions under control. Part of her had wanted to jump up and ravage Miley when the other girl had made her strange request, but the more rational side of her had, thankfully, prevailed.</p>
<p>She used both hands to cup Miley's cheeks and turn the brunette's face toward her own. There were definitely tears glittering in Miley's eyes and Lilly's stomach did a weird flop. Their eyes met and Lilly had to force herself to focus, so taken was she with the beautiful blue before her.</p>
<p>"Miley, please listen to me. It's not that I don't want to kiss you, because to be honest, I think you're absolutely beautiful and adorable and I would like nothing more than to meet your request, but…I just don't want it to be something you did on a whim, 'cause you were bored, or freaked out or to test something. A kiss should be special, not in some dinky elevator that smells slightly of pee. And you should go for the whole nine yards, a date, a kiss, to see how you feel, and if you want that person to be me, when we get out of here I'd be more than happy to oblige."</p>
<p>Following her own whim, Lilly leaned forward and pressed her lips ever so softly to Miley's forehead. When she leaned back, Miley offered her a soft smile, but her eyes were still wet with tears. Lilly frowned and brushed a few of them away as she removed her hands. "Don't cry. I'm not good with crying girls, it freaks me out."</p>
<p>Miley chuckled, wiping more tears from her cheeks. "I'm sorry, I blame the hormones. It's like constantly being on edge; sometimes I don't even feel like myself. When I first started showing my brother Jackson made a fat comment and I locked myself in my room and cried for hours."</p>
<p>"He sounds like a jerk," said Lilly with a frown, though she was relieved she had fully resolved the tricky situation from before. She was still kneeling right in front of Miley and it was rather uncomfortable, so she sat, though didn't move away from her current position directly in front of her friend.</p>
<p>"He <b>is </b>a jerk, but normally I would've just slapped him over the head. He felt so bad after that incident he has hardly done or said a mean thing to me since. Though I guess that reprieve will be over soon."</p>
<p>"Maybe he'll remain nice to you after Pele is born."</p>
<p>"Did you just name my son?"</p>
<p>Lilly grinned. "Pele was a great soccer player, but if you don't like him, there are plenty of others to choose from."</p>
<p>Miley boxed her arm slightly, but she was smiling. "Please, my family would never forgive me if I named him something they can't pronounce."</p>
<p>"Your family sounds…interesting."</p>
<p>"They are strange, but they're always there for you. Even Jackson, despite his many faults. Daddy says I'll probably graduate before him at the rate he's going."</p>
<p>"Wait, he goes here?" asked Lilly and Miley nodded. "Jackson Stewart?" Miley nodded again, confused now and Lilly laughed. "I think he's in one of my classes. I'm pretty sure he tried to hit on me."</p>
<p>Miley laughed, too. "Yeah, that must be him. Man, he's gonna be mad when he finds out you offered to go on a date with me."</p>
<p>"I guess there's just something that draws you Stewarts to me," said Lilly jokingly, thinking there was no way Miley's short and goofy brother would stand a chance against his sister with her anyway.</p>
<p>"Well, as long as you stay away from my dad, we'll be alright," said Miley seriously. Lilly made a face, her odd expression enough to make Miley laugh. They continued to talk deep into the night, joking, teasing and flirting with one another as the time passed. Lilly could honestly say she had never felt so at ease with another person, not even Joanie, and they had dated for two years. Miley felt the same way, happy to have someone who listened, but who wasn't afraid to joke and tease, and who hadn't judged her in the slightest. Eventually they both drifted off to sleep, not in their separate corners, but side by side.</p>
<p>XxX</p>
<p>Lilly awoke to a persistent nudging in her back, like the tiniest of blows relentlessly torturing her. She tried to swat away whatever it was, but when her hand met with something soft and warm she sat up. Miley was curled up right behind her, her belly pressed against Lilly's back while she slept. Lilly chuckled as she realized the tiny blows had come from the baby kicking her back. She had no idea how Miley even slept through all that movement. Lilly reluctantly moved back to her corner, almost immediately missing Miley's warmth and the baby's obnoxious kicks. Lilly had never been a baby person, she normally avoided them at all costs, but something about Miley and the little soccer player inside of her made Lilly feel happy and protective. She lay back down and closed her eyes, exhausted still despite all the sleep.</p>
<p>The next time she awoke it was to find Miley standing in the other corner, both hands on her lower back while she leaned against the wall. Lilly sat up and rubbed the sleep from her eyes, feeling out of it. A glance at her watch told her it was just past 1 pm and she tried to suppress the thought of having to spend another 20 hours in here. Miley looked over when she heard Lilly move and though she offered a smile, her face was pained.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Miley sighed, leaning forward slightly and back again. "My back is killing me. All this sitting and sleeping on the floor is really screwing with it."</p>
<p>Lilly watched her friend and stood. She couldn't stand to see Miley suffer and, though she was a bit nervous about being so forward, went up to her to offer her hands. "I can give you a backrub, if you'd like. I'm not great at it, but it's gotta beat doing it yourself."</p>
<p>Seeing Miley hesitate, Lilly shook her head. She hadn't wanted to make the other girl uncomfortable. "Hey, I totally understand if you're not comfortable with it. It's okay."</p>
<p>"No, no, that's not it. I think I'm in enough discomfort to let even Jake touch me. I was just trying to figure out the best way to do this," said Miley before Lilly could retreat.</p>
<p>Lilly smiled and motioned for Miley to lean against the wall. Miley complied and Lilly moved her shaking hands to the small of the other girl's back. She was nervous, but wanted to do this right and took a deep breath to calm herself down. As soon as she began massaging the muscles under her fingertips, Miley moaned and Lilly's face flushed bright red. She cursed herself for being so perverted and gritted her teeth, trying to focus. Miley was like putty under her hands, forehead pressed against the wall, hands resting right by her head. Lilly didn't know much about massaging, she had always refused Joanie's requests, but she could tell Miley's back was incredibly tight.</p>
<p>"You weren't in this much pain this morning. Did you sleep wrong or something?"</p>
<p>Miley's voice was soft when she replied, almost as if she were falling asleep and Lilly was proud of her sudden prowess. "I don't know. It started sometime this morning. I sorta tried to sleep through it, but it just kept getting worse. It kinda comes and goes, though."</p>
<p>Lilly stopped her ministrations abruptly, her hands still on Miley's back. She stared at her friend in shock. "You mean like…contractions?"</p>
<p>Miley stiffened under her hands and turned, her face suddenly frightened. "No…I mean, I don't think so. Wouldn't I know if I were having contractions?"</p>
<p>"You mean like feeling intense pain that comes and goes and gets worse?" said Lilly sarcastically, but immediately regretted it upon seeing the look of sheer terror cross Miley's face.</p>
<p>"But that would mean I'm in labor…and I can't be. It's too soon and we're in an <b>elevator</b>." Miley sounded completely panicked at the end and Lilly had to grab her shoulders to get her to focus. Before she could say anything, however, Miley grimaced and almost sagged against her. Lilly wrapped her arms around the girl, while Miley's hands found their way to Lilly's shirt, holding on tightly. Judging by the way Miley felt completely stiff against her and the pained look on her face, she really was having a contraction and Lilly tried to keep her own panic at bay. Of all the things to go wrong now, it had to be this.</p>
<p>It wasn't long at all before Miley relaxed in her arms and Lilly lowered them both to sit on the ground. Miley pulled away and tears were once again shining in her eyes. She hugged her belly and her quivering chin and teary eyes broke Lilly's heart. "Oh god, what're we gonna do? It's too soon and…I can't do this, Lilly…not here…and not now…and what're we gonna do?"</p>
<p>Lilly knew she had to focus and make calming Miley down her top priority. She put her hands back on the other girl's shoulders, meeting Miley's eyes. "Miley, it'll be okay. It's fine. <b>He's</b> gonna be fine. <b>You're </b>gonna be fine. We're gonna do this, okay?"</p>
<p>"But there are no doctors and…what if something goes wrong? And we're still stuck here a-and…"</p>
<p>"Plenty of women have babies without doctors, without hospitals. Women did it for thousands of years, and you can do it, too. And maybe we'll get out before he's even ready to be born. Labor can take a long time, especially with your first baby. It's gonna be okay, Miles." Lilly tried to sound as soothing and confident as possible, but on the inside she was panicking just as much.</p>
<p>"How's it gonna be okay? We don't know what to do!" Miley was still crying and Lilly was worried she'd stress out the baby, or herself.</p>
<p>"Your body knows what to do. And I took a First Aid class last semester."</p>
<p>"Are you serious?" Miley suddenly sounded more incredulous than panicked and Lilly hoped she'd somehow distracted her.</p>
<p>"Totally."</p>
<p>"How's that gonna help?"</p>
<p>"They taught us how to deliver a baby. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing." Lilly wasn't so sure she knew what she was doing, but she wouldn't tell Miley. She did remember the lesson on childbirth and, at the time, had dismissed it with a 'when would I <b>ever</b> need that?'.</p>
<p>"What grade did you get?"</p>
<p>Lilly grinned sheepishly. "I'm sure it was an A. It'll be alright. It's not even gonna come to that, watch, but if I have to, I'll know what to do."</p>
<p>Miley shook her head and wiped her eyes. She had never been so glad for another person's presence as she was right now. Lilly's strong confidence and calmness were keeping her from freaking out. "Okay, but I am not naming my son after you just 'cause you delivered him."</p>
<p>Lilly grinned, relieved Miley seemed to have calmed down somewhat. "And here I was really hoping to see a boy named Lillian."</p>
<p>Miley only swatted her arm lightly, acting like she was annoyed with the blonde, but remained where she was in close proximity. Lilly moved next to Miley, sitting as close to her as possible as they both leaned against the wall. Though Lilly was nervous about the closeness, too, she knew Miley would say something if she didn't want her there and was likely seeking comfort in her time of pain and fear. Lilly grabbed her pack of cards again and they both played half-heartedly for a little while, until Miley's hand clamped onto Lilly's, her face once again contorted in pain.</p>
