<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 15: Tombstone -->

<p>Josie left Phoenix at the OK Corral and the pair walked over to
		the saloon. Rebecca had wisely changed into her dress. Despite it's battered appearance,
		it would certainly raise fewer questions than her britches would. Josie of course remained
		in her dark outfit, looking every bit the outlaw. She grabbed the younger woman's upper
		arm and pulled her close to speak before entering the saloon. "Listen to me
		carefully. Don't talk to anyone, don't look at anyone, and never leave my side." The
		look in her blue eyes and the tone in her voice made it clear that this wasn't any kind of
		request. Rebecca nodded, noting somewhere in the back of her mind that at least the outlaw
		was bringing her in instead of leaving her somewhere else to wait for her. </p>

		<p>Pushing the swinging half doors apart Josie strode in and took an
		all-encompassing look around. A long bar took up the wall on the left, while stairs and a
		piano took the wall at the far end. The right side of the saloon consisted of several
		small green felt covered round tables surrounded by chairs, some of which looked ready to
		fall apart. Josie kept Rebecca between her and the door as they walked over to the bar.
		"Whiskey," she ordered, and as an afterthought she added, "and
		sarsaparilla." </p>

		<p>There was no question as to which drink belonged to whom. The
		portly barkeep placed the shot glass and bottle in front of the tall woman and handed the
		smaller woman the non-alcoholic drink. "Two bits for the whiskey and twenty cents for
		the soda." </p>

		<p>Josie tossed the coins on the bar and turned to watch the goings
		on. Her eyes fell on a table of three men playing poker. With one gulp, she drained her
		drink and set the glass on the bar. "Stay here," she said before walking over to
		the trio. </p>

		<p>"Hello boys." They looked up from their battered cards
		to see the imposing woman towering over them. "You seem to be short. Is my money any
		good at this table?" </p>

		<p>The biggest of the men, a large, burly fellow with a scraggly
		beard and a long jagged scar across his face looked at the meager pot in front of him. The
		potential benefit from letting this woman into the game was appealing. Despite the six
		guns slung low on her hips, she was still a woman, and he had no doubt that he could
		handle himself well enough with any woman alive. He grinned to reveal uneven rows of brown
		teeth and tipped his hat to the gunslinger. "Why, shore, there's always room for a
		pretty gal at our table, right boys?" The others were not as certain as their large
		friend of their ability to handle themselves with someone as formidable as this woman
		appeared to be. But they silently agreed that there was safety in numbers, and did nothing
		to dissuade her from sitting down. She pulled a chair out and dropped into it. </p>

		<p>"Deal," she said with a smile that did not do anything
		to remove the icy glint from her eyes. </p>

		<p>Two hours later, the burly man threw his cards down in disgust
		and slowly rose, making sure to keep his hands away from his sidearm. "You've broken
		me, Miss. I'm done." Josie nodded with satisfaction as she pulled the last pot
		closer. No sooner had she gotten the notes and coins into her pocket than the skinny man
		sitting across from her narrowed his gaze and lowered his hand below the table. He'd be
		damned if a woman was going to walk away with his money. Before he could get his hand on
		his gun, the table suddenly flipped upwards at him, blocking his vision before slamming
		into him with enough force to send him backward, his chair splintering upon contact with
		the wooden floor. The third man in the group had similar thoughts and made a move for his
		gun. A roundhouse kick sent her heel into the side of his face and the fight was on. None
		of the patrons seemed to care what the fight was about as they began scrapping with each
		other. Rebecca worked her way closer and closer to the swinging doors, ducking once as
		part of a chair came flying at her. She tried to locate Josie in the mass pandemonium of
		flying bodies and smashing bottles. She found her only when two men tossed the dark clad
		woman down the length of the bar. With a gleeful yelp, Josie stood up on the bar and
		looked for the best place to jump back into the fray. She somersaulted off the bar and
		landed with her feet against the chest of a very surprised patron. After a couple of
		minutes the barkeep sighed, threw his towel down on the bar, and buried his face in his
		hands while shaking his head in disbelief. A few minutes later Josie appeared at Rebecca's
		side apparently no worse for wear, although her shirtsleeve was almost completely torn
		off. "Having fun?" she asked breathlessly before grabbing two men and knocking
		their heads together. </p>

		<p>"Not as much as you seem to be having," Rebecca quipped
		as she jumped back to avoid another flying body. </p>

		<p>"Nothing like a good fight to get my juices flowing,"
		Josie replied with a feral smile still on her face as she looked around at the rolling
		battle. The sound of a shotgun being fired several times into the ceiling brought the
		bedlam to a standstill as everyone turned to see the source of the shots. The barkeep was
		standing there, gun in hand, covered with dust from the ceiling that he had shot. He
		looked up at the holes and sighed again. </p>

		<p>"Every time a woman comes in, there's trouble," he
		muttered, his gaze leveled at the pair near the doorway. Josie reached in her pocket and
		pulled out several bills then put them on the bar before turning and leaving. The barkeep
		looked at the retreating form in surprise as he picked up the notes from the counter.
		</p>

		<p>"What happened in there?" Rebecca asked as they headed
		up the street to the boarding house. </p>

		<p>"The pip-squeak across from me didn't like losing to a
		woman," she said casually as she inspected the torn shirt. "Looks like you'll be
		doing some sewing tonight." </p>

		<p>"I don't mind." Rebecca answered as she looked at the
		jagged tear. The shirt wasn't much to begin with; the elbows were worn almost through, the
		collar was frayed, and two buttons hung loosely by their threads. "Although the best
		thing to do would be to get you a new shirt." The look she received told her that was
		out of the question. "Or I could sew this one up," she said with a tone of
		defeat in her voice. </p>

		<p>"Ten dollars?" The muscles in Josie's jaw tensed
		noticeably. "No way in tarnation am I going to pay that much!" She turned and
		stomped over to the door assuming that Rebecca would follow. The young woman had other
		ideas, however. </p>

		<p>"Look, you have to admit that ten dollars is a lot to ask
		for such a..." she paused and looked around the parlor as if to pick just the right
		word. "...quaint little place. After all, the flophouse near the corral only charges
		four dollars a week for both of us." </p>

		<p>"I include one meal a day with my price," the boarding
		house owner protested. "Eight dollars." </p>

		<p>"Six and you throw in a bath for tonight," the young
		woman countered. Josie watched the debate carefully. Clearly Rebecca had the knowledge of
		words and the wit to haggle efficiently. </p>

		<p>"Seven and the bath." </p>

		<p>She started to say 'six', but the look on the proprietress face
		told her she would not go any lower. Rebecca knew that seven was more than fair for two
		people. She decided to quit before she talked them into sleeping in the corral with the
		horses. "All right, seven, but that had better include the bath." </p>

		<p>"I said it did, didn't I," the woman said irritably.
		"Take the room at the end of the hall. Outhouse is in back." </p>

		<p>Rebecca turned to Josie, a bit fearful that the outlaw would be
		mad at her for stepping in. Instead, the tall woman nodded and handed over the required
		funds. While it wasn't a smile or words of praise, the young woman still somehow
		understood the silent message that was conveyed. </p>

		<p>Rebecca stood nervously at the side of the bed, looking at it as
		if there were sharp razors waiting for her. "What's the problem?" Josie said as
		she removed her clothes. "Haven't you ever slept with another woman before?"
		</p>

		<p>"No! Why..." she stopped when she realized what the
		outlaw meant. Blushing hotly, she continued. "I mean, well, with my sister and
		occasionally a cousin, but...." She turned away from the now naked woman. "I
		guess I'm just a bit shy." </p>

		<p>"So it would seem," Josie replied as she pulled a
		nightshirt over her head and down her body. Although designed for a full-grown man, it
		only came to mid thigh on her tall frame. "Are you going to sleep in your
		dress?" </p>

		<p>"What? Oh no, of course not." She turned and walked
		behind the privacy screen, not seeing the way Josie rolled her eyes and smiled. </p>

		<p>They each lay on an edge of the bed trying to stay as far apart
		as possible to leave room for the other. Always a deep sleeper, Rebecca was out quickly.
		Josie, however, was easily awakened by the slightest noise and found the young woman's
		light snoring to be distracting. Several times she adjusted her pillow to try to muffle
		the sounds, but with no success; her keen hearing wouldn't allow it. She lay awake as hour
		after hour passed. In the darkness of the night, the loner reflected back on her life. She
		saw visions of the crimes she had committed over the years, the looks of abject terror on
		the faces of her victims. Years of running, robbing, and hard drinking had blocked all
		those sights from her mind. As dawn settled across the land, she thought about how she had
		helped the town of Mason's Gulch and the sense of accomplishment she felt when she had
		stopped the band of thieves. It was time for her to make a decision, one that would
		forever alter her life one way or another. She had never consciously made a choice to be a
		criminal; it had happened by accident. For the first time in years she believed she
		actually had a choice between being good or evil. The full sun was visible before she
		gathered the courage to make the only choice that she could live with. </p>
