<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 8 -->

<p>The cafeteria went dead silent as everybody focused their attention between the two tables.  No one dared speak. They didn't want to miss a single second.</p>
		<p>The feuds between members of both tables were legendary and every single person knew that what was about to happen wouldn't be anything less. </p>
		<p>They could feel it. </p>
		<p>Besides, they were bored shitless. </p>
		<p>Nothing of interest had happened of late, and the events to come would no doubt keep the school talking for days.</p>
		<p>"What the hell are you doing?" Brooke hissed, casting wary glances towards Sam.</p>
		<p>Nicole shrugged. "I haven't met my "Annoy Spam" requirement for the day". </p>
		<p>Brooke stood up and grabbed Nicole by the arm. </p>
		<p>"Look, I don't want to start any trouble. So just drop it, okay?".</p>
		<p>"Too late Brookie". Nicole replied, smiling in anticipation as Alex made his way over. </p>
		<p>He did not look happy.</p>
		<p>"Is there a problem Alex?" Nicole asked with a smirk.</p>
		<p>"I'd prefer it if you kept your smart ass comments to yourself." He answered.</p>
		<p>Nicole laughed.</p>
		<p>"Oh come on! I was just playing around. No need to get so worked up over a harmless little comment." Nicole smiled. She could feel every pair of eyes focused on them and she was loving every minute of it. It was time they were reminded of who Queen Bitch was around here.</p>
		<p><i>Besides, there's nothing like a good confrontation to spice up the day in this hell hole.</i></p>
		<p>"You? Make a harmless comment? Don't make me laugh". He stepped forward, closing the gap between the two cheerleaders.</p>
		<p>"I mean it. Get off Sam's case". He looked at Brooke. "And that includes you".</p>
		<p>The audience drew in a collective breath. </p>
		<p><i>Ooooo! This is getting good! </i></p>
		<p>Some leaned forward in anticipation, others wished they had a carton of popcorn.</p>
		<p>Sam watched on with baited breath as the confrontation became hore heated. She had urged Alex to let the comment go, and now things were turning ugly.</p>
		<p>She focused her gaze on Brooke. She grimaced.</p>
		<p><i>Ooooo!</i> <i>This isn't good!</i></p>
		<p>Sam had seen Brooke in all her angry glory on countless occasions, most of the time the cause of anger being Sam herself, and there was no doubting the look in her eye.</p>
		<p><i>She is majorly pissed!</i></p>
		<p>Nicole glanced at Brooke, practically feeling the anger radiating from her. She loved seeing her this way. She was magnificent when she got her groove on.</p>
		<p>Sexy too, though Nicole kept those comments to herself.</p>
		<p>Brooke stepped forward, closing the gap between them even further. </p>
		<p>"Why don't you just drop the macho act, Adam. It doesn't become you." </p>
		<p>Alex glared. </p>
		<p>"You may be the supposed "most popular girl in the school", but you could at least have the decency to get my name right".</p>
		<p>He wasn't finished yet. Ever since he had started dating Sam, Brooke had treated him with nothing but contempt and he was sick of it.</p>
		<p><i>You are going to get it, bitch.</i></p>
		<p>"I don't know what I've said or done to make you not like me. Frankly, I couldn't give a rat's ass. You can glare at me, swear at me, hit me over the head with a baseball bat, but I won't have you treat Sam like crap. You got me?"</p>
		<p>Before Brooke had a chance to reply, Nicole spoke up. </p>
		<p>"Hey, dumbass, I made the comment to Spam, remember? So why don't you just back  off".</p>
		<p>Alex simply ignored her. He stepped back and began to casually pace in front of them, his tone losing some of it's previous anger, replaced instead by curiousity.</p>
		<p>"It's gotten me wondering, actually, why you've been such an ass to both of us. And then it hit me". </p>
		<p>Brooke froze. <i>Dear god, please don't tell me he's figured it out.</i></p>
		<p>"You're jealous."</p>
		<p>He paused.</p>
		<p>"Of Sam". </p>
		<p>He stopped in front of her.</p>
		<p>"And you can't handle the fact that I chose your stepsister over you, Little Miss Popular Cheerleader."</p>
		<p>Brooke smiled, as relief flooded through her body. She laughed.</p>
		<p>"You arrogant pig. What makes you think that I would ever consider going out with you?"</p>
		<p>Alex cringed. Now<i> there is a blow to my ego if I ever heard one. </i></p>
		<p>Having the most popular girl in school announce that in front of everybody was not exactly good for one's image. He quickly recovered.</p>
		<p><i>Bitch.</i></p>
		<p>"The feeling's mutual Brooke. You're not exactly my type either." He raked his eyes up and down her body, his face showing contempt.</p>
		<p>"I actually like the fact my girlfriend doesn't disappear when she turns sideaways".</p>
		<p>He paused.</p>
		<p>"Why don't you go and eat something?"</p>
		<p>Dead silence.</p>
		<p>The rapt audience cringed. Sam let out a gasp, her eyes widening in horror.</p>
		<p><i>Oh god, please don't tell me he just said that.</i></p>
		<p>It was common knowledge amongst the student body that Brooke had suffered from an eating disorder. They focused their attention on the blonde cheerleader, wondering how she would respond.</p>
		<p>Brooke, feeling like she had been punched in the gut, stepped back, her face white.</p>
		<p>Nicole, on the other hand, lunged forward and gave Alex  a hearty shove.</p>
		<p>"You stupid bastard! Say something like that again, and I'll shove my pom poms so far up your ass, you'll be wearing them as a permanent head piece!"</p>
		<p>Before Nicole could get another chance to leap at Alex, Brooke grabbed her by the arm, holding her back. "It's okay Nic".</p>
		<p>They walked out without another word, Nicole giving Alex one last shove as she passed him by. He shook his head, realising that he had gone too far. He glanced up when he saw someone stop in front of him.</p>
		<p>It was Sam, disappointment clear in her eyes.</p>
		<p>"You shouldn't have said that". She said quietly.</p>
		<p>She left.</p>
		<p>Alex hung his head, full of shame and remorse. After several moments, he too left the cafeteria, which was still shrouded in silence.</p>
		<p>One girl turned to her friend beside her. "One for the books, huh?"</p>
		<p>He shook his head in amazement. "You're telling me".</p>
		<p>They began to eat.</p>
