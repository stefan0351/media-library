<!-- Kara's Moon \ Fourteen -->

<p>"You're looking better today," Nana said over breakfast.</p>
		<p>"You skipped your walk," Ginny accused. "I could have fended for myself."</p>
		<p>"I wanted to make sure you were okay. You missed dinner."</p>
		<p>Ginny hadn't left her room the night before. She had slept some. A troubled
			sleep, but still, she had slept. She had heard Nana moving about in the house,
			had heard her making dinner, but she didn't want to join her. She didn't want to
			have to answer any questions. So she had stayed in bed, pretending to be asleep.
			She was hiding from Nana, but she couldn't hide from her thoughts. Or her
			dreams.</p>
		<p>But she was better this morning. She didn't get all flushed when she thought
			about Kara's kiss, at least. Well, not much anyway. She closed her eyes. I won't
			think about it today. I won't.</p>
		<p>They rode to the store together and Ginny stayed busy, doing paper work and
			trying desperately to occupy her mind. It worked. She was surprised when she
			glanced at the clock and it was already after twelve.</p>
		<p>"Aren't you going for lunch?" Nana asked.</p>
		<p>"I think I'll just eat it here," she said.</p>
		<p>"You've been working nonstop. You should get away," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny rubbed her head, thinking that if Nana even had a clue as to what was
			going on inside her, she would not want her to be alone with her thoughts for
			even one minute.</p>
		<p>"No. I don't really feel like going to the park today," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana shrugged. "I'll make you a sandwich, then."</p>
		<p>Ginny opened her mouth to stop her. She wasn't hungry. But she let Nana walk
			away. She would force down the sandwich and save herself having to answer to
			Nana.</p>
		<p>"Oh, there's Kara," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny's heart fluttered in her chest and her palms grew damp as she raised
			her eyes to the door.</p>
		<p>"Well, she didn't stop," Nana said. "I guess she was out sketching."</p>
		<p>Ginny let out a sigh of relief and briefly thanked the heavens for sparing
			her. She didn't think she could face Kara. Not yet. And especially not in front
			of Nana.</p>
		<p>"I really like her, Ginny," Nana said when she brought their sandwiches.
			"Maybe we need to fix her up."</p>
		<p>"Fix her up?"</p>
		<p>"With a man," Nana explained.</p>
		<p>Ginny covered her mouth and suppressed the laughter that threatened to
			surface. Fix her up with a man?</p>
		<p>"Maybe Phil knows some nice man that would be perfect for her." Nana smiled
			sadly. "She's already thirty-four. She can't wait around for ever."</p>
		<p>"Nana, I don't think Kara would appreciate you-"</p>
		<p>"Oh, I know she said she wasn't looking, that she didn't need anyone, but I
			don't believe that for a minute. She's so attractive. If she would wear a little
			makeup and grow her hair out, she would have men lining up to ask her out."</p>
		<p>Ginny bit into her sandwich to save from answering. It was no use. Nana would
			never be convinced that a woman could be happy without a man in her life. Of
			course, Ginny could always tell Nana the truth, that Kara preferred to be with
			women.</p>
		<p>"Oh, well. I guess it's really none of my business," Nana said. "She'll be
			going back to Seattle soon, anyway."</p>
		<p>"Yes, she will," Ginny murmured. The sooner, the better, she thought.</p>
		<p>Nana fixed her eyes on Ginny. "Why haven't you called Phil?"</p>
		<p>"I . . . just haven't."</p>
		<p>"Ginny, don't make the man wait forever. He may lose patience and then what?
			Maybe he'll meet someone else and then who will you have?"</p>
		<p>"Nana, please don't start," Ginny pleaded.</p>
		<p>"Do I need to call him myself?"</p>
		<p>"Don't you dare!"</p>
		<p>Nana stared at her for a moment longer. "Well, I declare. Women nowadays.
			I'll never understand you."</p>
		<p>Ginny rubbed her temples, trying to ward off the headache that threatened.
			She wanted to scream out in frustration. Her nerves were on edge and she counted
			to ten before speaking.</p>
		<p>"Nana, we've been over this time and again. When I'm ready, I'll call him,"
			she said quietly. "Now, please. I don't want to talk about it."</p>
		<p>"I'm only concerned-"</p>
		<p>"I know you are," she said gently. "And I love you for it."</p>
		<p>The bell jingled and a customer came in, a stranger, and Nana got up to help
			them and Ginny closed her eyes in relief. It was one thing to be worried over
			these feelings she had for Kara, but at least that she could do silently. Nana's
			constant concern over her and Phil's relationship was slowly wearing her down
			until she was certain that she was going to snap at her.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Ginny. If you happen to talk to Kara, ask her about Sunday," Nana
			called.</p>
		<p>"Sunday?"</p>
		<p>"You haven't forgotten? Settler's Day is Sunday," Nana reminded her. </p>
		<p>Settler's Day in the park. Ginny had forgotten. The town got together each
			year to celebrate its founding with food and drink and music. For a mere five
			dollars a person, all the burgers and fries you could eat and a glass of keg
			beer would run you only a buck. </p>
		<p>"Nana, I don't think Kara would enjoy it. I mean, it's burgers," she
			said.</p>
		<p>"Oh, pooh. There's plenty of other stuff to eat," Nana said, dismissing her
			lame excuse with a wave of her hand. "She doesn't know a soul here, Ginny. It
			would be rude if we didn't invite her."</p>
		<p>"But still . . .."</p>
		<p>"Ginny? Why in the world wouldn't you want to invite her? There'll be tons of
			tourists there. At least, we hope so," she added. "The more people, the more
			money."</p>
		<p>Ginny smiled and nodded. "Okay. If I talk to her, I'll mention it," she
			conceded. But, of course, she had no intention of talking to her. Kara would
			never know about Settler's Day from her. </p>
