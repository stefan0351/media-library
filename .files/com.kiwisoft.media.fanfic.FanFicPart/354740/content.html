<!-- Blood \ Chapter 5 -->

<P>"Oh my God, I'm turning into Harry Kim." While B'Elanna Torres didn't say the thought out loud it seemed to echo in her mind. Allowing her pace to settle from the near run she had used to get out of the mess hall she stepped into a turbolift. Part of her was ready to get back to work, but her body protested, telling her she needed to sit down. Deciding to take the rest of her break in her quarters she gave the computer the command and settled back as the decks started flying by. "Your body temperature has been steadily increasing since we have begun talking." While she remembered those words in her head she spoke the next ones to the empty turbolift. "Seven, you are NOT helping me resolve my feelings, and letting me know you could see how hot you were getting me." </P>
<P>The sentence dissolved into a growl. She did suddenly feel a kinship with the fresh-faced operations officer in the way embarrassment seemed to combine with arousal to cause tightness in her belly and aching points of sensitivity under her uniform tunic. Wrapping her arms tightly around herself she hugged with all she had, and it seemed to help relieve the tension in the rest of her body, but it seemed to deposit it all in that growing tightness in her lower abdomen. The rest of her body was left feeling tired and aching, and all she could think of as she stepped out the turbolift doors was getting to her quarters and laying down. That thought was the only one on her mind and when her door opened she stumbled through and went straight to her bed. Collapsing on it she didn't even realize her eyes were drifting closed.</P>
<P>At least not until she woke up and recognized the darkened hallways she was now in. A rush of awareness shot through her as she heard the clicking she now recognized the high heels the Doctor had been so wonderful to add to Seven's biosuit. Even as her chest started to heave in anticipation of the chase a wicked smile curved her face, and she was off. The clicking was matched by the hammering of B'Elanna's boots outside and the thudding of her pulse inside. It reached the point it nearly blocked out the external sounds as red seemed to tint her vision. When Seven finally did appear the shock nearly caused stars to dance in her vision. Seven took advantage by slamming her palms to the wall on either side of Torres.</P>
<P>Yet instead of struggling her found herself sniffing. An instinctive need that bought up faint remembrances of times she had been close enough to smell Seven. The biological funk that most drones had from the normally humid environment of the cube was gone. No longer did she smell of human flesh penetrated by machine. The smell was clean, light. The only comparison was an ocean breeze, but instead of the light tang of slat air Seven smelled of health, vibrancy. As if the body contained under that form hugging biosuit was a pure vessel of life. B'Elanna Torres found she could not get enough, and she didn't even realize she was registering her approval with a constant low growl. </P>
<P>Seven seemed to feel the same as she took in the scent of B'Elanna's skin and hair, though her growl sounded more like a rumbling purr coming from somewhere deep in the woman's chest. It was the same instinct that drove her to sniff drove her sniffing to move up the long neck and to the perfect face. B'Elanna's hovering spoke to Seven and with out a word the long neck moved back, exposing her cheek, offering it's perfection for B'Elanna's mark. The idea alone made B'Elanna's growl grow in intensity as her mouth opened. </P>
<P>"Engineering to Lieutenant Torres." Sleep turned to wakefulness as the growl turned into a shout. "What?" B'Elanna realized she should have tried to keep the rage out of her voice as she answered her commbadge, but she found she really did not care. Yet as the voice on the other end told her she was late coming back from her break she felt the rage leave, only to be replaced by a bone deep weariness.</P>
