<P>An: Wow I can't believe that it has taken me so long to update. I am really really sorry guys! I had a lot of stuff going on, like my dad's accident, graduation, and the senior trip. The good news is that I won't be going to school for a long time so I can dedicate more time to writing this story. I'm debating on bringing Scott into my story or letting Kate and Beth fight to get together another way.  Right now I'm leaning towards keeping Scott OUT of this story but I'm not sure yet. Let me know what you guys think and I'll take your opinions into consideration. Anyways I'm done blabbering on…here is the next chapter. Enjoy! (I know I did when I wrote it)</P><P><U>Chapter 5</U></P><P>(Lori POV)</P><P>I feel like a secret agent. I made sure I got up early this morning before either of the girls so that I could set my plans into motion. Phase One…call Grace, Beth's mom, and figure out what she thought about all of this. We went to the local café and I told her everything, including my plan. I was pleasantly surprised that she too wanted Kate and Beth together. Since we were now on the same team we figured it was time to set step one into motion. When I got home the girls were awake and eating breakfast.</P><P>"Hey girls. How did you sleep last night? You know I sometimes find that couch uncomfortable." I say while smirking at them.</P><P>They both blush and mutter fine. Is it mean that I love to torture them? Nah, I don't think so. What am I doing? I am on a very strict schedule with Operation: Keth…no Bate…no Kabeth? Huh I'll figure it out later. Grace should be calling any minute now to give Beth some fake excuse as to why she has to stay with us for a while longer. Brilliant, huh? Well, I do what I can. The phone begins to ring…perfect!</P><P>"Hello? Sure just a minute. Beth, it's your mom." I hand her the phone and she shares a short conversation with her before she hands me back the phone.</P><P>"She wants to talk to you." I take it and pretend to be surprised and go along with everything before I hang up.</P><P>"Beth, since your parents are going out of town for business your mother thinks it would be a good idea if you stayed here and I agree. So how about you two go to your house so you can get some more clothes and then spend the day outside of the house…go and do something fun?"  I am trying so hard not to laugh or smile at the whole situation.</P><P>She smiles at me with a mix of total happiness and also uneasiness…heh good, she must be nervous about living with Kate that long. Kate gives me the exact same expression…even better!</P><P>"Okay. Kate, are you ready to go?" She smiles at her with a look of adoration. Kate doesn't notice, sometimes I can't believe how naïve that girl is. Kate smiles and nods then both the girls leave.</P><P>Once they are gone it's time to set Phase Two into motion…..call Heather and Carrie. Since they were on their way back home from their short vacation it was easy to get a hold of them. Once again, I explained everything to both of the girls and they told me that they had been trying to get Beth and Kate together for awhile now. They agreed to join our team. YES! It will be nice to have two spies on the inside.  Now that I've got that all figured out, I need to go and ponder some new ideas on how to get them together.</P><P>(Beth POV)</P><P>Kate's mom is acting really strange. First she made a crack about us sleeping together on the couch but the way she said it really shocked me. I am a master when it comes to plans and I can definitely tell that Lori is planning something. Then, I discovered that my parents are going out of town and I am gonna have to stay with Kate. When I found out I was extremely happy but then I was hit with uneasiness because I don't know if I can be around Kate that long without slipping up.</P><P>Then, when we went to get my clothes my mom was acting weird. There is definitely something fishy going on around here. After we get my clothes Kate and I decide that it would be fun to go play laser tag.  Little did she know that I have a plan that shouldn't compromise anything if I play it out correctly.</P><P>We are getting geared up and I can hardly contain my excitement. "Beth, are you okay? You seem a little…different." Kate is looking at me with that cute confused look that she has and I can hardly keep my train of thought…god, I'm turning into a love sick puppy.</P><P>"Yeah, I'm just excited…you know how I love laser tag." I laugh it off and she looks at me with disbelief but lets it go regardless.</P><P>There are a lot of other people playing with us. That should make my plan go a lot smoother.</P><P>We enter in the course and go our separate ways. I am stalking through the dark, taking out people as I go along. Finally I spot Kate, this is the moment I've been waiting for. I sneak up behind her in the dark and shoot out both her lights and mine. The minute everything goes dark I turn her around and crash my lips with hers. She moans at the contact…I guess she feels the sparks like I do. I hear both of our suits begin to power up so I make a quick exit before they light up. Once I'm in a corner by myself I breath a sigh of relief and put my hand up to my lips. I really kissed Kate and better yet, Kate kissed me back.</P><P>(Kate POV)</P><P>Whoa! That all happened really fast. I was minding my own business, looking for people to shoot, when all of a sudden both mine and someone else's suit goes off, leaving us in complete darkness. In the next moment, I am whipped around and then I feel someone's lips forcefully collide with my own. I couldn't help but moan at the contact because it sent full shock waves through my entire body. I haven't felt like this since Beth kissed me in John's truck.  Once our suits started to power and light back up they vanished, as if they were never there at all. I knew they were though because the of the burning sensation on my lips was proof. Gosh, what is happening to me…letting an unknown person kiss me, and even worse I kissed back. I don't know what's happening to me but I want them to do it again. What is wrong with me? I need to get a hold of myself and get back to neutral. For some strange reason my heart is telling me that it was Beth, but my head disagrees. Is it bad that I wish that the mystery person is Beth. That's a funny thought, Beth liking me. Only in my dreams…every night!</P><P>AN: Okay so before I forget, I should tell you guys that I don't use a beta and I don't proof read an awful lot, so any and all mistakes are my fault and I apologize! This chapter is shorter than my others, but it is more juicy. So sorry for the shortness and for it taking me so long to get this up. Thanks for reading and review! Oh, and I want your opinions' on 2 things…if I should bring in Scott and what should the Kate/Beth shipper name be? (Keth, Bate, Kabeth, or throw out some suggestions)</P>
