<!-- The Better Life \ Chapter 4: Count Your Blessings, Seduce A Stranger -->

<p>"Do you even know where we're going?"  Faith asked Gavin.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's right down here and left, be patient."</p>
<p>"Whatever dude," Faith rolled down the window as she lit a cigarette.  "You
want one?"  Gavin nodded, and she handed him hers, lighting another one, she
inhaled deeply blowing the smoke out the window.  "So what you think?  We
gonna get some tonight?"</p>
<p>"You always get some Faith, then get gone, wasn't that how it was with me?"
Gavin asked, a little bitterness creeping into his voice.</p>
<p>"I am still riding around in your car aren't I?  You know we could never
really be together, you always go for the crazy girls expecting them to
settle down, you my friend, need a nice girl."</p>
<p>"No such thing," Gavin said turning the car down a dirt road.  Faith laughed
at him.</p>
<p>"You'll find someone honey don't worry."  Faith patted his arm to console
him.  Gavin rolled his eyes as he pulled the car up next to the line of cars
along the road.</p>
<p>"So here we are."</p>
<p>"Great, time to rock and roll," Faith jumped out of the car, adjusting her
top, Gavin got out and came around next to Faith.  Together they walked up
the drive.</p>
<p>Inside the party was crazy.  Faith couldn't decide if she didn't know half
the people or if they were just too drunk for her to recognize.  When she was
barely in the door a girl practically jumped at her.  Faith caught her and
pushed her up to a standing position.</p>
<p>"I Juuusst knew you would come," the girl slurred at her.</p>
<p>"Yep her I am."</p>
<p>"So you wanna make out?"  The girl boldly asked.</p>
<p>"Nope," Faith pushed the girl back towards her friends.</p>
<p>"Whoa Faith, turning down a hottie?  That's so not like you," Gavin teased.</p>
<p>"What can I say, I'm looking for substance tonight," Faith smiled.  "Besides
I think I recognize that girl, I think she is freshman, Diane, or Dawn or
something.  Jailbait."  They laughed as they plowed through the crowd for
drinks.</p>
<p>Each with a drink in hand they found couch to lean on the back of to girl
watch.  This was their ritual at parties.</p>
<p>"How bout her," Gavin said pointing to a tall dark haired girl in a red tank
top.  Faith gave him a dubious look.</p>
<p>"I like a little bit of a challenge, she screams 'cheap slut' don't you want
better for me.  What about her?"  Faith asked pointing to a short chunky girl
with blonde streaks in her dark hair."</p>
<p>"Where?" Gavin asked trying to stand up straighter, Faith started laughing
and he figured out who she meant.  "Oh that's just wrong Faith.  Wait a
second look at her."  Faith followed his stare to a girl standing by the keg,
she was about her height, wore a tight pair of neon green pants, and small
black tank top, but the most stunning thing about her was her amazingly
purple hair, she was currently chugging beer with a few guys, and winning
everytime.</p>
<p>"You're kinda girl," Faith said slapping Gavin on the back and finishing her
beer.  "Here, go get us more beer."  Gavin nodded taking her empty glass and
walking toward the keg.  Faith shook her head watching him go.  He walked
over and she watched him start chatting with the girl.  Apparently he said
something funny, cause she started laughing putting an arm out to steady
herself on him.  Faith turned away from them to survey the crowd again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buffy paid the driver and got out of the car, and leaned back in to pay the
driver.</p>
<p>"Thanks," pulling out of the car, she turned and faced the house in front of
her, she heard the car pull away from behind her. 'No turning back now'.
The house was small and sorta run down, but right on the water, she could
hear people laughing and screaming on the beach.  Slowly she walked toward
the door, opened it up and stepped inside.  The heat hit Buffy right away,
the house really was small, and probably forty people were crammed into the
downstairs, so the air was smoke filled and hot.  Buffy looked around
nervously at the people, she really didn't want to run into her sisters, she
spotted Cordelia surrounded by some friends and hanging all over a guy, but
Dawn was no where in sight.  Oh well, time to blend in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faith looked around the room, and as her eyes swept past the door she paused,
the most beautiful blonde girl she had ever seen had just walked in.  She
looked a little lost and scared, Faith didn't think that she had ever seen
her before.</p>
<p>"So hey, I got her name and number," Gavin came back handing her a cup.</p>
<p>"Taz, 555-2634....Faith?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's cool," Faith handed him her cup and walked towards the girl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>Buffy turned at the sound of the voice, and the hand on her shoulder.  She
stared into the two chocolate brown eyes, her breath caught in her throat.
"Hey, um, hi, how are you?" Buffy said nervously.  Taking in Faiths whole
appearance, a tight pair of black leathers, and a garnet red, corset like top.</p>
<p>"Hi, I'm Faith, do I know you?"</p>
<p>"Um, no I don't think so, I mean I have seen you in school, but we never
really met, which is ok, cause I mean, why would we, not your fault or
anything."  Buffy quickly put her babble to a stop.</p>
<p>"Right, you want a drink?"  Buffy nodded, "Come on."  Faith put an arm around
her waist and led her over to Gavin.  She took both cups from his hands and
handed Buffy one.</p>
<p>"Hey, one of those was for me," he protested.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," Buffy started to hand hers back to him.  Faith put up a hand
to stop her.</p>
<p>"Go get another Gavin, talk to Taz," Faith waved him away.</p>
<p>"You could at least tell me who this beautiful stranger is," Gavin said mock
bowing and kissing Buffys hand.  Buffy giggled.</p>
<p>"My names Buffy."</p>
<p>"There," Faith pushed him up and turned him toward the keg. "She's Buffy, go
blend in," she put her mouth next to his ear.  "She's mine, stop flirting."</p>
<p>Gavin looked back smiling as he walked back over, throwing an arm around Taz
as he waited in line.</p>
<p>"He's nice," Buffy said looking after him.</p>
<p>"Yeah, a sweetie.  So you're Buffy?  Huh, I can't believe I have never seen
you in school."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I've seen you I mean, well," Buffy was embarrassed by how dumb
she was sounding.  "You always are busy in school, I just usually watch."
Faith pressed her body up close to Buffys, causing her to gasp.</p>
<p>"Like what you see?"  She breathed in her ear.  Buffy swallowed nodding.</p>
<p>"Good," Faith stepped back.  "You wanna go for a walk on the beach?"</p>
<p>"Sure," Buffy put down her drink and excepted Faiths outstretched hand.</p>
<p>Faith led her through the crowd, receiving a thumbs up from Gavin, and he in
turn the flip off.  She opened the back door to the beach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They walked past all the people partying on the beach, receiving more then
one catcall as they passed, but soon they were out of range and alone on the
beach with the moonlight and surf.  Buffy was pleased her hand was still
firmly entwined with Faiths.  As they got well away from the light of the
fire Faith turned to Buffy.  She ran a hand through her hair pushing stray
hairs away from her face, even though the wind fought to push them back.</p>
<p>"You are so perfect," Faith whispered under her breath.</p>
<p>"So are you," Buffy placed her hands on Faiths waist.  Faith was stunned that
she had been able to hear her.  Slowly Faiths lips moved towards Buffys,
which eagerly excepted them.  The kiss started off slow, and tentative, but
grew in its intensity.  As it did Faith pulled them both down to the sand,
half laying on Buffy, she started to push her hand under her shirt, but Buffy
pulled away breaking the kiss and sitting up.</p>
<p>"What?" Faith asked also sitting up.</p>
<p>"I don't know, this is gonna sound dumb, but I really like you, and I don't
wanna be just another girl who you get drunk at a party and screw. I mean it
would be fun, but I want it to be more then that," Buffy played with some
shells between her legs looking down at the sand as she spoke.  Faith looked
at her for a moment, taking in what she had just said.  None of the other
girls had ever even thought about stopping her, they just wanted to do
whatever it took for a chance at her money.  And now she sat her with
possibly the most beautiful girl she had ever had the luck of kissing, and it
sounded like she liked her.  Not for her money, but for her.  Faith reached a
hand over taking Buffys hand, and pulled them both up.</p>
<p>"Ok," she said, starting to lead them back to the party.</p>
<p>"So you want me to go now huh, that's ok I mean I understand, you wouldn't
ever want a relationship.." Buffy was interrupted by Faiths lips once again
pressing against hers.  Buffy lent into the kiss until Faith pulled away.
"I don't want you to go, I want to stand out her and do this all night, but I
also like you, and think you really like me, so I was taking you inside
where, this wouldn't happen.  I mean more time out here alone with you, and
well, I don't have that kind of self control."  Faith smiled winking, Buffy
returned the smile, and pulled herself close to Faith kissing her once more.
When she pulled away she saw Faith swallow, her eyes still closed.  "So yeah,
uh the party."  Faith said trying to compose herself.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's kinda boring, think we could go somewhere else?" Buffy asked as
they walked back towards the house.</p>
<p>"Sure, let me just find Gavin," Faith put an arm around Buffys waist pulling
her close as they walked.</p>
