<p>"Seven, what are you doing?"</p>
		<p>"Affixing a mirror to the corridor."</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>"So that I can see who is coming around the corner."</p>
		<p>"Er, why?"</p>
		<p>"So that I have enough time to change direction and decrease my chances of meeting certain people."</p>
		<p>"Which people?"</p>
		<p>"Shouldn't you be in engineering Lieutenant?"</p>
		<p>"No, I'm off duty. So come on who are you hiding from?"</p>
		<p>"I am not hiding from anyone."</p>
		<p>"Okay, but who do you wish to decrease the chances of meeting?"</p>
		<p>"It is not really any of your concern."</p>
		<p>"Oh look, the Captain's coming."</p>
		<p>&lt;Whoooosshhhhhh&gt;</p>
		<p>"Hey! Seven come back, I was only joking. Seven!"</p>
		<p>"There is no need to shout Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>"And there's no need for you to do the two minute mile through the corridor, but still you were doing it."</p>
		<p>"You are exaggerating as usual Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>"Maybe, but can I take it from your swift departure that it is indeed the Captain you wish to avoid?"</p>
		<p>"That would be a logical assumption."</p>
		<p>"Okay, so why?"</p>
		<p>"I do not have time for this idle chit chat Lieutenant, I still have to affix the mirror."</p>
		<p>"Fine, I'll just wait until you've finished and then ask again."</p>
		<p>"Could you please refrain from smirking."</p>
		<p>"How did you know I was smirking? I mean you've got your back to me."</p>
		<p>&lt;VVVVrrrrrrrrrrrVVVVrrrrrrrrr (that's an electric screwdriver, for those of you not familiar with the international phonetics of household tools lol)&gt;</p>
		<p>"Did the Borg equip you with eyes in the back of your head too? Or perhaps I should check under your biosuit for signs of newly sprouted implants."</p>
		<p>"I believe it is considered impolite to stare at someone's posterior like that."</p>
		<p>"I was not! How? I would never..."</p>
		<p>"You seem to have forgotten what it was I was erecting Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>"What? Of course the mirror."</p>
		<p>"Precisely."</p>
		<p>"Well I think you should check it for faults if it showed me looking anywhere near your...."</p>
		<p>"Bottom?"</p>
		<p>"Stop trying to change the subject, why are you hiding from Janeway?"</p>
		<p>"I am not hiding."</p>
		<p>"Seven!"</p>
		<p>"There is no need to stamp your foot Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>"Well?"</p>
		<p>"I simply wish to avoid anymore of the Captain's attempts to involve me in a romantic entanglement."</p>
		<p>"Oh."</p>
		<p>"Snickering like that is very unbecoming."</p>
		<p>"Sorry. So Katie's got the hots for you has she?"</p>
		<p>"It would appear she has developed a certain attraction towards me, yes."</p>
		<p>"And with all your Borg acquired knowledge the best plan you could come up with was hiding?"</p>
		<p>"I did consider other options."</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah, like what?"</p>
		<p>"Firstly I could succumb to her wishes and engage in a sexual relationship..."</p>
		<p>"Ewwwww."</p>
		<p>"...secondly, I could simply tell her of my disinterest..."</p>
		<p>"Sounds reasonable."</p>
		<p>"...thirdly, I could say I was already involved with someone else, or finally I hide."</p>
		<p>"Okay so what was wrong with number two?"</p>
		<p>"I was afraid it would hurt her feelings."</p>
		<p>"And hiding won't?"</p>
		<p>"The hiding is only temporary."</p>
		<p>"Temporary until when?"</p>
		<p>"Until I find someone with whom to engage in a fake romantic relationship."</p>
		<p>"Why fake?"</p>
		<p>"Because there is no one currently available to whom I feel attracted."</p>
		<p>"No one?"</p>
		<p>"No...Is it usual for Klingon's to pout Lieutenant?"</p>
		<p>"I am not pouting you stupid Borg."</p>
		<p>"I believe you are now engaged in what I believe is termed sulking."</p>
		<p>"I am not. Lets get back to you and your fake romance, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Acceptable."</p>
		<p>"Do you have anyone in mind?"</p>
		<p>"I was considering Commander Chakotay."</p>
		<p>"Chakotay! No way, no one would believe that, why'd you pick him?"</p>
		<p>"I believe that if the Captain thought I was seeing anyone of lower rank she would consider it a passing phase and not be totally deterred. Therefore my options where limited, considering both Commander Tuvok and yourself were already married, so I thought of Commander Chakotay."</p>
		<p>"He won't go for it."</p>
		<p>"How do you know?"</p>
		<p>"Because he's been waiting for years to get a chance at the Captain, he's not gonna waste the opportunity of catching her on the rebound once you've given her the knock back."</p>
		<p>"I see."</p>
		<p>"You know your data isn't quite accurate."</p>
		<p>"How so?" &lt;swoon, sorry that was me at the raised ocular implant&gt;</p>
		<p>"I'm not exactly married."</p>
		<p>"Elaborate."</p>
		<p>"Tom and I decided to separate."</p>
		<p>"Really, that is interesting."</p>
		<p>"You had better not say you're now considering asking him or I'll knock your block off."</p>
		<p>"I was not considering Mr Paris, and besides I do not have a block for you to knock off."</p>
		<p>"Whatever. So why was that interesting?"</p>
		<p>"Well with you now available it would make perfect sense if you were...." &lt;Whoooooossssshhhhhh&gt;</p>
		<p>"Seven!" "Seven!" "Oh hello Captain, sorry I think you've missed her, she said something about going on a space walk." "Glad to be of assistance."</p>
		<p>"Is she gone?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Thank you B'Elanna."</p>
		<p>"You're welco...hey, you used my real name."</p>
		<p>"I felt under the circumstances it was appropriate, do you disapprove?"</p>
		<p>"No, of course not. I kind of like the way you say it."</p>
		<p>"You do?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah."</p>
		<p>"B'Elanna, can I ask you something?"</p>
		<p>"Sure princess."</p>
		<p>"Princess?" &lt;swoon, ocular implant again.&gt;</p>
		<p>"Er, nothing, say what you were gonna ask me."</p>
		<p>"Would you consider being my fake romantic interest?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Oh."</p>
		<p>"But I would consider being your real romantic interest."</p>
		<p>"Oh."</p>
		<p>"Quick the Captain's coming."</p>
		<p>"Huh?"</p>
		<p>"Janeway!"</p>
		<p>"Hmm?"</p>
		<p>"Oh come here." &lt;smooching sounds can be heard the length of the corridor&gt;</p>
		<p>"SEVEN!!!" - Katie too latey</p>
		<p>"Yes Captain."</p>
		<p>"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"</p>
		<p>"I am kissing B'Elanna." &lt;more kissing sounds are heard as the two eagerly resume the activity&gt;</p>
		<p>"As a prelude to my taking Seven back to my quarters to ravish her senseless."</p>
		<p>&lt;Thunk! Poor Katie hits the floor.&gt;</p>
		<p>"Do you think we should take her to sickbay B'Elanna?"</p>
		<p>"Nah, we have more important matters to attend to." &lt;amid the kissing there is the distinct sound of a zipper being lowered.&gt; "I'll call Chakotay and tell him his time has come."</p>
		<p>"Acceptable. Can we go now?"</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah." &lt;A slight clatter is heard as the two women step over the Captain and begin a mad dash for deck 9&gt;</p>
