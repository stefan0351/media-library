<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Working Out -->

<p>Xena is in the wood, waiting for Griffith. His footsteps are getting louder, and the resulting earth tremors are getting more severe.</p>
		<p>Griffith comes into view, striding along the road. Xena darts out in front of him and confronts him.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Griffith. Do you know who I am?"</p>
		<p>He halts and stares down at her. </p>
		<p>"I'm Xena. The woman who killed your brother," she taunts.</p>
		<p>The information maddens him. "Xena! I'm going to turn you into roadkill."</p>
		<p>Xena laughs at him. "In your dreams, big boy." She turns and legs it.</p>
		<p>Griffith sets off in pursuit. "I've already stomped one warlord today. Now it's your turn."</p>
		<p>"You couldn't even catch a cold, you .... SISSY!"</p>
		<p>With a roar Griffith quickens his pace.</p>
		<p>Xena darts into the woods, and he follows her, scattering branches and small trees in his wake. They pound through a grove of pear trees, and she picks up some of the windfalls and throws them at him. They splatter his face and helmet with sticky sweetness. He roars, wipes the squashed fruit from his eyes and stomps on.</p>
		<p>"Rotten fruit isn't going to save you, Xena."</p>
		<p>She laughs and darts off again. "I never thought it would."</p>
		<p>A buzzing sound is getting louder. They are approaching the hollow oak tree with the bees in it.</p>
		<p>Xena runs past without mishap, but as Griffith runs by, she flings her chakram, disturbing the nest. An angry swarm rises, mistakenly assumes Griffith disturbed them, and goes after him.</p>
		<p>He laughs and swats at them as they fly at his head, angry at him and attracted by the sticky fruit. "Think a few stings are going to hurt me?"</p>
		<p>"Nope." She snatches her returning chakram from the air, holsters it, then runs off. He follows. </p>
		<p>They rejoin the road, and are pounding towards Kalmia now. The snake filled pothole comes into view.</p>
		<p>"Just hope those snakes haven't all escaped again," mutters Xena.</p>
		<p>In spite of the buzzing bees - and his swatting hands are infuriating them further - Griffith is gaining on Xena. But his steps are erratic, his attention divided ... so when Xena leaps athletically over the pothole, he steps right in it.</p>
		<p>A combined squishing/hissing sound comes from the pit. Griffith blinks and looks down to see what he's stepped in. Then he lifts his sandalled foot out. Some snakes are still clinging to it. He shakes them off ... then looks at Xena and grins horribly. He seems totally unaffected by her trap.</p>
		<p>"Uh oh!" says Xena under her breath. She gets ready to run again.</p>
		<p>Abruptly, Griffith's smile turns to a rictus, and his eyes roll up. He falls, like a felled Redwood, to the ground. Bees are still buzzing angrily about his pear-spattered face and helmet.</p>
		<p>Xena waits for a moment, then exhales in relief, and goes over to examine the giant. She prods him with a finger. The combined bee stings and snake bites have been too much for him. He is well and truly dead.</p>
		<p>Xena walks away.</p>
