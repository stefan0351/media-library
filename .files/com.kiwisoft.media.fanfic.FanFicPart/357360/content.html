<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 7-->
<p>Sam rose up from the position she had been lying in on the couch and slid
over closer to where Brooke was sitting.  She slid her right leg over
Brooke's then lowered herself down so that she was straddling the blonde's
hips and smiled.  Brooke placed her hands on Sam's hips steadying her but
other than that made no other movements.</p>

<p>"You want to say that again?" Sam asked slowly, as a dangerously sexy smile
spread across her face.</p>

<p>Brooke took a minute to think over her response, tilting her head up in the
air thoughtfully, before she replied, "I would prefer not to."</p>

<p>"You would prefer not to," Sam repeated contemplatively.  "You know what I
would prefer?"  she went on watching Brooke shift uncomfortably beneath her.
  Brooke looked up at Sam and smiled.  She knew what the look in the other
girls eyes meant and she couldn't help but become absolutely giddy at the
sight of it.  Sam then leaned in and brought their lips together
passionately.  Brooke's left hand tightened the hold that it had on Sam's
waist while her right one began to trail over Sam's body, moving down to her
thighs, rubbing them in an up and down motion as she leaned forward into
Sam.</p>

<p>Brooke felt Sam press down onto her thigh increasing the contact between
them as she dipped her head down focusing her attention on Brooke's neck and
jaw line; which she had discovered were quite sensitive.  Brooke moaned
deeply and dipped the hand which had been resting on Sam's hip under the
brunette's shirt shuddering lightly when she felt her heated skin beneath
her fingers.  Brooke's hand continued to journey north as Sam returned her
lips to Brooke's once more, one of her hands moving behind Brooke's neck
pulling her towards her.</p>

<p>As Brooke's hand finally made contact with Sam's breast the brunette groaned
and pushed down onto Brooke's thigh once again.  Brooke could feel her heat
this time, the passion building between them creating a haze around her.
She moved her hands back to Sam's waist and began to lift up her shirt.
Stopping just underneath Sam's breasts Brooke made a quick movement shifting
their positions so that Sam was now laying on her back while Brooke was
situated partially on top of her and in between her legs.</p>

<p>Brooke immediately brought her lips to the exposed flesh of Sam's abdomen,
placing feathery kisses all around and dipping into her belly button licking
and occasionally scraping her teeth against Sam's skin.  She could feel
Sam's hands in her hair, holding her in place, and was acutely aware of the
way the body beneath her quivered every time she touched it.</p>

<p>She raised her head and looked up into Sam's face.  This was farther than
they had ever gone before, they were treading in uncharted territory and
Brooke needed to see if they were still together.  Sam looked down at her
with stormy eyes, her lips faintly parted and her hair hanging around her
head like a disheveled hallow.  Her lips curled up into a sweet smile as she
watched Brooke regard her, and the cheerleader was suddenly overcome by
emotions so strong she wasn't sure she could name them if ever the test were
put before her.  She rose up from her position by Sam's waist conquered by
the desire to kiss her.  To place her ear over Sam's heart and hear it beat.
  So she did.  And when she had removed her lips from Sam's and placed her
face on her chest she tilted her eyes upward and whispered, "I love your
smile."  It wasn't exactly what she had planned on saying, but I would do.</p>

<p>"I love how you make me smile," she responded with the upturned lips Brooke
had just commented on with appreciation, then she placed her hand lifting
Brooke's head up so that she could once again take her lips.  As they kissed
Sam's other hand slipped under Brooke's shirt mirroring the blonde's earlier
actions as Brooke gave herself up to Sam's ministrations.</p>

<p>They were rudely snapped out their haze by the sound of knocking at the
door.  Brooke reacting more from instinct than anything else rolled off of
Sam and into a standing position while simultaneously exclaiming, "Holy
God!"</p>

<p>"Who is it?" Sam asked sitting up herself.  Brooke simply looked down at Sam
and raised an eyebrow.  "Right," Sam responded standing up.  "Sorry."</p>

<p>
Sam opened the door to find Carmyn and Lily standing on the porch with their
hands clasped behind their backs, smiling at her in a particularly
suspicious way.  Sam was slightly disconcerted seeing them standing there
and as such was slow to respond when Carmyn led the way into the house.</p>

<p>"Hey," Lily said by way of greeting as Carm pulled her into the hallway.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam said finally starting to pull out of her stupor.  "What are you
guys doing here?" she continued as she looked down at herself as discreetly
as possible to make sure that everything was in it's place.  She had the
distinct impression that she looked like she had been rolling around on the
couch engaged in heavy petting, and the fact that her friends were now
staring at her intently only intensified her anxiety.</p>

<p>"We need to talk," Carmyn said seriously as she  looked at Sam.  "It's
extremely important."</p>

<p>Sam eyes drifted from Carm to something just behind her and then back to
Carm again.  It wasn't the stealthy, inconspicuous motion she thought it was
and it caused Carm to turn around and notice Brooke hovering around the
living room door for the first time.  When Carm made eye contact with her
Brooke immediately, almost guiltily, dropped her gaze and muttered something
about Nicole and Mary Cherry then made a bee-line for the nearest exit.
Once she was gone both Carmyn and Lily focused their attention on Sam who
was mentally berating Brooke for abandoning her to the inquisition, and at
the same time envious of her ability to bail the hell out of there.</p>

<p>Sam shook her head as she watched Brooke retreat, then turned to face her
company.  "Where did she find those people?" she muttered somewhat
rhetorically, her voice coated with disdain.  Carmyn smirked at the question
as Lily regarded Sam.</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" Lily asked looking at the brunette more closely.  "You look
a little flushed."  There was silence for a moment then Carmyn responded by
knocking her in the shoulder gently and cocking her head to the side, saying
in that time old tradition, 'you know!'.  Lily's eyes widened in response as
her brain caught up with her mouth and she muttered, "oh, yeah I forgot."</p>

<p>"Forgot what?" Sam asked having heard the utterance as she ushered them out
of the foyer and into the kitchen.  She wasn't prepared to re-enter the
living room just yet.</p>

<p>"Okay," Carmyn said gearing herself up for what was about to occur.  "We
could be coy about this, you know, beat around bush, sniff around, tiptoe,
creep..."</p>

<p>"I get it," Sam cut in.  "You could be less than forward."</p>

<p>"Right.  So we could do that, but we won't.  We discussed this at length and
I decided that honesty is the best policy."  Sam noticed the shift from 'We'
to 'I' and turned to look at Lily who simply rolled her eyes.  Sam smiled
and turned her attention back to Carm.</p>

<p>"Alright," was all she said urging Carm on.</p>

<p>"Okay," Carm said taking a deep breath.  "Simply put...we know what's going on
with you and Brooke."</p>

<p>"Going on?" Sam responded very carefully.  She didn't want to have another
freak out like at lunch at week before.  "Between me and Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  We know...that you two are like together romantically...in a gay way,"
Carm clarified.  Lily merely stood there, she thought that it was the best
possible course of action.  Besides, she figured that Carm had been very
clear, she didn't think it was possible to get any clearer, except for maybe
diagrams.  She really hoped Carm didn't draw a diagram.</p>

<p>Sam stood there for a moment simply staring off into space before focusing
on the two girls in front of her once more.  "What makes you say that?" she
responded calmly.</p>

<p>"We saw you two making out," Lily said piping up.  Carm shot her a look.
"What?  It's true."</p>

<p>"Oh," Sam responded.  She figured that she could try to deny it, she was
creative that way, but she didn't see what the point would be.  They had
obviously figured out what was going on and they hadn't freaked out or
wigged out or really outted anything but her which led Sam to the conclusion
that denying it would just be...well stupid.  "Okay.  Then," was all that she
managed to get out however.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Carm went on, "what we really wanted to tell you is that we're
happy if you're happy and that if you want to talk we're here for you.  If
mean sure we were surprised at first, and then we had ice-cream, but
well...even though this wasn't officially part of the speech, Brooke's like
the hottest girl in school so, like, props and all that," she finished
shifting her weight from one foot to the other nervously before settling
into a set position.  "Oh, and Lily's got pamphlets."</p>

<p>"Pamphlets?" Sam asked in voice cracking mid-sentence.  Her mind was
spinning, not only did they know they had gone out and gotten pamphlets?
Sam couldn't even conceive of what kind of pamphlets could they have gotten
anyway?  It wasn't like they were discussing healthy eating and certainly
pregnancy wasn't an issue.  She couldn't believe it, they had gotten
pamphlets!  That was, she couldn't...ugh.</p>

<p>"Pamphlet," Lily corrected digging into her hand bag and pulling it out.  A
bewildered Sam took the offered booklet and read the cover, a look of agony
soon coming over her face.</p>

<p>"Same-sex - Safe sex," she read out before gazing at Lily.  "I...I'm at a loss
for words. Truly."</p>

<p>"I just hope it didn't come to late," Lily responded honestly if somewhat
gravely.</p>

<p>"Come to la....just how much have you two talked about this!?!" Sam asked
rather alarmed when she realized what Lily was insinuating.  "You can be
concerned with your friends, but you can't be CONCERNED with your friends,
if you know what I mean," Sam went on her voice raising in pitch a little.
They had been discussing whether or not she and Brooke had...consummated their
relationship, that seriously freaked Sam out, she was officially
overwhelmed.  She had always assumed that the coming out process involved
baby steps, this was like direct entrance into the tour de France.  She
wanted her baby steps dammit!</p>

<p>Carm was the one to respond.  "It's just that this is a big, empty house.
And you two have some big teenage hormones and there's a hot tub and..."</p>

<p>"Oh my god, we are NOT having this conversation!" Sam exclaimed.  It was one
thing for her to think about making love to Brooke, it was another thing to
hear her friends discuss the possibility like it was an excursion to the
mall, or perhaps a week-end getaway.  Her love life was not something to be
examined in a committee.  "No!" Sam exclaimed holding up her hand when she
saw Lily about to say something.  "No but, no but, no but...no, N-O but!" she
went flashing them both the 'talk to the hand' gesture out of pure
desperation.  Why couldn't they see that she was having a nervous breakdown?
  Why didn't they shut up?</p>

<p>Those were questions Sam never got the answer to for she came to find out
that her feelings had very little effect on how the rest of the night would
actually turn out.  By the time Brooke returned home her two closest friends
in the world ripped far more information about her-and what was happening in
her life-then she would have thought possible and that turned out to be for
the best because after she stopped freaking and just talked to them she felt
like a huge weight-one which she had only been mildly aware of carrying
before-had been lifted off of her shoulders, and that was most certainly a
good thing.</p>
