<p>"You have GOT to be freaking kidding me!" Brooke screeched as she flung her backpack across the living room. It impacted with the wall with a sharp bang. She whirled around to face her father, her face a contorted mask of barely controlled rage.</p>
<p>"Brooke, calm down," Mike ordered calmly. Brooke's glare intensified.</p>
<p>"I will NOT! How DARE you! How could you even THINK that I'd go along with it?" she ranted absolutely outraged.</p>
<p>"Tyler is a nice young man. He has a good head on his shoulders. I work with his father and have met Tyler a few times. And he'd be delighted to go out with you," Mike explained as if Brooke hadn't spoken at all. The more he went on, the redder her face got with anger.</p>
<p>"How dare you?" she repeated in a growl. "How dare you decide who I'm going to date!"</p>
<p>"I'm your father and as such I will make the right decisions concerning your life," he informed her sternly. Brooke put her hands on her hips and stared at Mike incredulously.</p>
<p>"OK, tell me something; exactly which part of 'I'm GAY and deeply in love with SAM' is SO hard for you to follow?" she asked sarcastically. "Because I'll be glad to go over it again for you if you missed any of it the first ten thousand times!" Mike's face flushed purple as he glowered at his daughter.</p>
<p>"You are NOT to speak about 'that' again in my presence. As long as you live under MY roof, there is to be no mention of _HER_," he spat the word, unable to even say Sam's name out loud.</p>
<p>"Uhm, hello? Reality check? That's why I left in the first place, you idiot! You said the exact same thing months ago, so I left. I did as you requested. YOU'RE the one who decided to hunt me down and drag me back here against my will. I don't want to live here. I'm nothing more than your prisoner, not your daughter. I HATE it here!"</p>
<p>"Don't you speak to me that way, young lady. I'm your father and you WILL respect me," Mike demanded. Brooke laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>"Respect you? RESPECT YOU? Respect is something that has to be earned, not taken. You haven't earned my respect; you've earned my contempt and hatred. Not only have you treated me like I was some sort of freak or evil, but you BEAT the girl that I love. You beat her, hurt her! Do you even understand what you did?" she raged.</p>
<p>"You hit her! Raised your hands against her, DAD!" she said the title sourly and dripping with scorn and contempt. "You bruised and bloodied her. A seventeen year old girl against a forty year old grown man. That was fair," she added sarcastically. "And why? Because she did nothing but love me with her whole heart. She was keeping you from hurting me or Jane. Do you even realize that?" Brooke wanted her father to understand the scope of what he did. He didn't just hit Sam, he had tried to attack his daughter and fiancee. She wasn't sure he was even aware of those facts.</p>
<p>"You are going out with Tyler and THAT is final!" Mike screamed ignoring Brooke's whole indignant speech. Apparently, Brooke realized, he couldn't care less.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? How do you plan to make me? Are you going to beat me into submission too?" she asked sarcastically. A look of shock and hurt flashed across Mike's face but was quickly replaced by anger.</p>
<p>"Seems to me a spanking might do you some good," he snapped.</p>
<p>"Spanking? Is that what you call what you did to Sam? Jesus, Dad, I've seen boxers take less blows than she did. Get a grip!"</p>
<p>"Now you listen to me, young lady," Mike began in a low dangerous voice. Brooke raised a brow as she focused her disinterested attention on him. "You WILL be going out with Tyler Ross tomorrow night. You WILL behave and make sure that Tyler has a nice time." Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"Want me to fuck him too? So that you can keep pretending that I'm straight?" She flinched as Mike raised his hand to slap her. They stood there staring each other down for several tense minutes as Mike's hand hovered threateningly in the air above them. Finally, he lowered it.</p>
<p>"Don't you EVER speak to me like that again. Do you hear me?" Mike warned, enraged and barely in control. Brooke stared at him in badly disguised shock.</p>
<p>"You were going to hit me," she gasped with the realization. Mike just kept glaring at her. Brooke blinked in stunned shock as she tried to wrap her mind around the fact that her father had almost hit her and this time, Sam wasn't there to stop him. She didn't know who he was anymore and she was scared. As her shock wore off, her anger returned and she returned her father's glare with a fiery gaze of her own. If that was how he wanted it to be, Brooke was more than prepared to play dirty.</p>
<p>"You had your say, Mike. My turn. You will never, EVER raise your hand to me again. Get that?" she hissed. "I can and will report you for abuse, emotional and physical. And I'm absolutely sure the local gay right's groups would LOVE to get involved in this whole situation. You would be ruined if this hit the papers," she threatened gleefully.</p>
<p>"Don't threaten me," Mike shot back.</p>
<p>"Consider it a promise, Warden Jailer, sir!" Brooke saluted. She started up the stairs to her room.</p>
<p>"Be ready at 7 tomorrow, Brooke. Or else," Mike called up after her.</p>
<p>"Bite me!" she screamed back and then slammed her bedroom door shut.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Lily Esposito, you put those things right back where they belong," Maria ordered gruffly as Lily quietly continued packing her suitcase. She shook her head at her mother sadly.</p>
<p>"No, Mama, I won't," she said calmly. Maria stepped closer to her daughter in an effort to intimidate her.</p>
<p>"You are not leaving this house without my permission," she informed Lily, her voice taking on a hard edge." Lily still didn't look up from her packing. She really wished Nicole was there for moral and emotional support. She always felt more sure of herself, stronger when Nicole was nearby. But Nicole was in Switzerland so Lily was going to have to do this alone.</p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong, Mama," she sighed. "I am leaving and there's nothing you can do to stop me."</p>
<p>"You are a child! You will do as I say!" Maria ranted loudly. Lily closed her eyes a second and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I'm not the one acting unreasonable and childish," she said opening her eyes. The more irritated Maria got, the calmer Lily felt.</p>
<p>"What is that supposed to mean?" Maria demanded to know, insulted.</p>
<p>"Mama, you're the one who can't deal with who I am. I accept and love myself. I have no reason not to. But you insist on trying to make me feel bad, like I've done something wrong. And I won't give into that. It's my life, not yours."</p>
<p>"And you want to be gay?" Maria asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"I want to be happy. Nicole makes me happy and she happens to be a woman. So, I guess in your narrow-minded way of thinking, yes, I do," Maria grabbed the suitcase off the bed and flung its contents across the room. Lily sighed again and started picking up the fallen items and repacking the bag, undisturbed by the outburst.</p>
<p>"That was mature, Mother," she said snidely.</p>
<p>"You are NOT leaving!" Maria repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am. Uncle Alberto offered me a place to stay because he thinks you're being unreasonable and unfair. That's where I'm going."</p>
<p>"To live with your gay uncle. I should have seen that one coming. Your kind stick together," her mother said nastily. Lily frowned.</p>
<p>"I'm going to ignore that last comment. But at least there I'll be accepted and loved." Maria gasped.</p>
<p>"You think I don't love you?" she asked in shock. Lily finally looked at her mother. And for the first time since the whole mess started, she didn't see the uncaring monster who separated her from her lover. She saw a confused and frightened woman who didn't understand what was going on with someone she loved. She also saw a mother concerned and worried about her daughter's choices. Lily's heart softened a little towards her mother and some of her hurt and anger faded. Maria was only trying to do what she thought was right, in her own misguided way.</p>
<p>"I know you love me, Mama. I just don't always feel it anymore. You're always yelling at me, ordering me around. You don't talk to me anymore or try to understand who I am. That's why I can't stay here right now, Mama. You're killing me," Lily whispered.</p>
<p>"Oh Lily, I want what's right for you."</p>
<p>"Nic is what's right for me and you refuse to accept that," Lily pointed out softly.</p>
<p>"That isn't God's way," Maria countered. Lily rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Love is love, Mama, regardless of the gender it comes in," Lily explained her philosophy. "Would you rather see me miserable for the rest of my life pretending to be what I'm not? Because I will never be happy with a man, Mama."</p>
<p>"I can't accept that, Lily," Maria wept.</p>
<p>"I know, Mama. That's why I'm gonna go. And you can sent the police after me as many times as you want. I'll just keep leaving. There's nothing you can do to make me stay here."</p>
<p>"If you leave, you can never come back," Maria threatened with the only card she had left to play. Lily shrugged. She had hoped her mother wouldn't pull that one.</p>
<p>"I know," she said flatly. "I don't plan to."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Wow, you moved out, Lily? Good for you," Brooke said happily the next day at lunch. She and Lily were sitting together despite their parents orders not to. It was their only real chance to talk anymore.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Lily nodded, proud of herself. "Walking away from my mother wasn't easy but I had to do it. Thank God for Uncle Alberto. I just wish Niki could have seen it."</p>
<p>"Lucky you," Brooke sighed. Lily tilted her head and looked at the blonde.</p>
<p>"Can't you just walk out too?" she asked. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"And go where? To Aunt Terri? Dad almost had her locked up the last time she helped us out. I'm not going to get her into more trouble. Jane and Sam? God, I'd love to but they're cramped in a motel room with Mac now, adding me will only make it worse. Besides, my Dad has already made it clear that if I try to leave, I'll be spending the rest of my teen years at Stansfield boarding school in Canada. Or someplace equally as far from Sam and I don't want that. So, I have to grin and bare it," she grumbled.</p>
<p>"Oh, and get this: Dad has set me up on a blind date with the son of some guy that he works with!"</p>
<p>"Oh geeze," Lily mumbled exasperated. "When?"</p>
<p>"Tonight at 7," Brooke answered sarcastically. She decided not to mention the fact that Mike had nearly hit her as they'd argued. "You WILL go out with Tyler Ross tomorrow night and you will behave and make sure Tyler has a nice time!" she imitated her father. Lily giggled.</p>
<p>"Oh joy."</p>
<p>"Tell me about it. Y'know, it isn't even so much the date that bothers me. I can see where my dad is coming from. He's trying real hard to stay on Denial Isle. What bothers me, Lil, is that I can't even mention Sam's name. He goes ballistic. I'm talking SCARY ballistic. But how are we supposed to work through this if I can't even mention her?" Brooke wondered. Lily shrugged.</p>
<p>"I haven't a clue, Brooke. I wish I could help," she said wistfully. "How is Sam anyway?" Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I haven't really seen or heard from her since that day in the park. Her e-mails have kinda stopped and I'm worried. Aunt Terri says she's healing still and managing to sleep but getting very withdrawn." She turned and looked Lily in the eye. Lily could see the traces of fear and worry in Brooke's hazel eyes.</p>
<p>"Lily, I'm worried that if I wait too long, I'll never be able to draw her out again. You know how Sam can be."</p>
<p>"Stubborn as Hell?" Lily provided helpfully. Brooke snickered and nodded.</p>
<p>"Among other things," she ran a hand through her blonde hair. "I'm just afraid I'm going to lose her during all this. That her pain and fear will make her close up and she'll slip through my fingers before I can stop her."</p>
<p>"You can't let that happen, Brooke," Lily advised. "No matter what else happens."</p>
<p>"I know, Lily. I just don't know how to stop it."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Brooke, Tyler's here!" Mike called up the stairs. "And you'd better be dressed correctly this time."</p>
<p>Brooke grinned to herself as she smoothed her hands over her maroon skirt. She knew she looked decent this time.</p>
<p>(Third try's the charm) she smirked into the mirror. Her first two attempts at dressing had not gone over well. Outfit #1 was ratty sweats, a torn T-shirt and muddy sneakers with her hair pulled back in a ponytail and no makeup. Her father had insisted on something more appropriate. So Brooke returned over the stairs in a black, barely there mini skirt that left nothing to the imagination and a matching bra. That's it, along with black strap stiletto sandals. She looked like an extra dancer from a Britney Spears video. Mike was not amused and told her to try again and to get it right or he would chose the outfit for her. So now she stood in a tasteful, non-revealing silk white blouse and a mid-length maroon skirt. It would have to do because she was out of time.</p>
<p>She walked over the stairs and saw whom she assumed was Tyler standing in the living room talking to her father. She had to admit, the guy was cute. Tall, muscular, with short black hair and bright sparkling green eyes. He smiled a nearly perfect smile when he saw Brooke and she noticed the deep dimples in both his cheeks. He was simply male model material.</p>
<p>"Hi, you must be Brooke," he greeted her politely, extending his hand.</p>
<p>"Must be," Brooke mumbled under her breath.</p>
<p>"I'm Tyler, pleased to meet you." Brooke shook his hand, slightly disappointed that both men missed her comment.</p>
<p>"Hey," she responded boredly. Mike smiled at what he obviously saw as a perfect match. Brooke had no doubt that the man was already picturing his grandchildren.</p>
<p>(Not in THIS lifetime) she scoffed silently.</p>
<p>"Well, you two go and have fun. Have her home by 2 or so, Tyler," Mike said happily. Brooke stared shocked at her father. Her curfew had always been midnight, even on weekends.</p>
<p>"I will, sir, thank you," Tyler said respectfully as he and Brooke exited the Palace.</p>
<p>"Behave, Brooke," Mike whispered lowly in his daughter's ear as she passed. She rolled her eyes at him.</p>
<p>Tyler and Brooke walked to the car without saying a word as he held the door for her. After they pulled away, a deafening silence overpowered them for several miles.</p>
<p>"I...uh...I thought dinner at La Mirage and then a movie. If that's OK with you," Tyler spoke, breaking the oppressive silence. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Whatever."</p>
<p>"You look really nice," he tried again to stimulate conversation.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Brooke said flatly while drumming her fingers on the side of the door.</p>
<p>"You're welcome. I think we could really have a good time tonight..." Tyler started. Brooke turned to face him from her seat.</p>
<p>"Look, Tyler, no offense because I'm sure you're a really sweet guy and all. But this whole 'date' thing wasn't even my idea. I'm opposed to it. In fact, I'll be honest with you. Just so you know, I happen to be gay," she informed him.</p>
<p>"So, whatever you thought might come from this little version of 'The Dating Game' my father is playing, it won't. I'm sorry but, I'm not interested," she finished. Tyler let out a rush of air that sounded vaguely like a laugh.</p>
<p>"Just so you know, Brooke, we're even. No offense to you either, but I don't want to be here anymore than you do," he glanced at her and smiled. "I have a girlfriend whom I happen to love very much." Brooke frowned in confusion for a moment but then smiled.</p>
<p>"So do I. I love her very much. So what's going on here?"</p>
<p>"My dad doesn't approve of Catherine, she's African-American. He doesn't believe in mixing the races and is rather animate about it," Tyler explained sadly.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see," Brooke said. "So my father's a homophobe and yours is a racist. No wonder they get along so well, they probably went for sheet fittings together." They both laughed.</p>
<p>"So, since we would both rather be with someone else, how about we agree to make the most of the situation?" Tyler suggested. Brooke smirked devilishly as a purely evil, Nicole worthy thought sprang to mind.</p>
<p>"Actually, Tyler, I have a better idea," she said with a giggle that piqued Tyler's interest. "How are you at subterfuge?"</p>
