<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 4 -->

<p>Seven stopped convulsing almost as fast as she had started. B'Elanna was
sitting with her back against the wall and had her arms wrapped tightly around
Seven, who was sitting between her legs. Seven's left arm was pulled up behind
her head because of the link between her tubules and the computer console. Her
eyes were open but they seemed blank almost as if she was blind, staring at
nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven? Seven? Can you hear me?&quot; B'Elanna whispered in Seven's ear
with a calmness that she did not feel.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.. Lt. I can.. hear you.&quot; Seven whispered back in a broken
speech.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, you must disengage your tubules from the interface. Your
implants are being drained of power and your human systems have suffered from
shock. I need to get you to sickbay to repair the damage to your systems.&quot;
The Doctor said as he stood close by monitoring Seven's condition on a
tricorder he got from the emergency holodeck medikit.</p>

<p>&quot;I am unable to terminate the link because I did not initiate it. Lt.,
you must shut down the holodeck program so that the link will automatically be
severed.&quot; Seven whispered, keeping the answer clipped because she was
having trouble concentrating. Seven realized almost immediately that the
holodeck computer was accessing her cortical implant. From what Seven saw of
the scan she did right before the console ruptured, Seven realised that the
backup gelpacks had failed. Without a link to the main computer any more and
the holodeck still running, the computer was looking for a new source of
information to run a program. If Seven allowed the computer full access to her
'memories' it would run what ever pops into Seven's head as a program for all
those present to see. Suffice it to say Seven didn't want that to happen so she
was busy trying not to think of anything.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna, Seven. Call me Lanna.&quot; B'Elanna whispered and then called
out to Vorik, &quot;Vorik, get down to engineering and try to shut down main power
to the holodecks, I want this program shut down now. Also send a team up here
to the main holodeck controls and have them work on shutting it down as well.
Whoever can get it done faster. I also noticed that the gelpacks for the
holodeck were fried so there is no more link to the main computer. Which means
you'll have to shut down the holodeck manually so get a move on.&quot; Torres
dismissed Vorik with a sense of urgency. Torres also realized what Seven was
going through, trying not to let the computer replay her memories for everyone
to see. &quot;Seven it might be better if you close your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point the Captain, who was holding Seven's right hand in her's, was
now furious. Not only did she not know what was going on but she began to feel
very jealous of the familiar way B'Elanna was interacting with Seven.
&quot;Lt., care to explain why it would be better for Seven to close her
eyes?&quot; And with that the engineer gave the Captain an abridged version of
what was happening to Seven. Now the Captain knew what was going on and was
even angrier because the chief engineer was now sitting cradling the ex-borg
(something the Captain felt she should be doing) instead of helping to speed up
the process of shutting down the computer. &quot;Lt., perhaps it would go a lot
faster if we had you trying to shut down the holodeck considering you are the
best engineer we have.&quot; The Captain suggested in a cold tone reflecting
some of her jealously.</p>

<p>This surprised Seven greatly causing a momentary lapse in concentration.
Seven opened her eyes slowly, showing just how weak she was feeling, and saw
the large pile of gift boxes left in a corner when the program shut down. A
memory of a past Christmas flashed through her mind and the computer
immediately picked up on it. A shock went through Seven's body causing her to
spasm and close her eyes again but when she opened them the holodeck was no
longer in grid format.</p>

<p>The entire Voyager crew present in the holodeck now found themselves aboard
the bridge of the starship Raven. Coming out of one of the adjoining rooms were
the Hanson's. Little Annika, who had to have been about five years old was
blind folded and being led by her mother and father to the helm console where a
brightly wrapped gift box was sitting atop of. The younger version of Seven of
Nine was trying to peak under the blind fold as she was being led to the
surprise. &quot;Now Ana, no peaking. Your Christmas gift is suppose to be a
surprise.&quot; Admonished Annika's mother. Now standing in front of the gift,
Magnus Hanson removed the blind fold and handed the package to Ana.
Unfortunately, before Ana could open it the ship rocked from side to side. Both
adults rushed to a computer console to find out what happened and found that
the borg were too close for comfort. &quot;Honey, why don't you take your
present inside and play for a little while and we'll have the party at another
time, okay?&quot; Magnus didn't wait for a reply as he went to work immediately
leaving a teary eyed Ana to go off and celebrate yet another holiday alone.</p>

<p>The holodeck then returned to normal grid format as Vorik's disembodied
voice announced that the holodeck had been successfully shut down. No one
present had a dry eye after witnessing that scene relayed from Seven's memory.
Even the emotionless borg had tears streaming down her face remembering the
heart breaking day and seeing her parents alive instead of living as drones.
Seven's tubules then released their connection to the computer and the Doctor
came over to scan Seven one last time. The results from the scan showed that
Seven's systems were returning to normal so the Doctor didn't press the issue
of a full exam in sickbay giving Seven some time to recover emotionally. Seven
was an emotional mess at this point and couldn't stop herself from weeping.
B'Elanna upon hearing this wrapped her arms tighter around Seven offering her
some comfort and then asked the Captain to clear the room. The Captain agreed
readily realizing that Seven would not want to be seen this way. No one put up
an argument but instead left quietly and peacefully affording Seven her
privacy.</p>
