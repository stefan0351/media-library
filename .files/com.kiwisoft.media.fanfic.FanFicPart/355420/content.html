<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Eighteen -->

<p>&lt;I?m warm and I?m cold?that can?t be right&gt; Sam?s thoughts were fuzzy and disjointed as she floated towards consciousness. There was something pulling at her, calling her further out. It was only a vague rumbling sound at first but as she focused on it, she was eventually able to make out Brooke?s soothing voice talking to her, comforting her.</p>
<p>"?before you came out to everyone about your own sexuality I knew about my own," she heard Brooke say.</p>
<p>&lt;Huh? What?&gt; Sam?s foggy mind desperately tried to catch up.</p>
<p>"And when you came out, I thought, ?God, here?s my chance. Maybe, just maybe Sam will give me a chance to prove to her how much I care?. But I got scared. I couldn?t seem to find the right time, the right words. And then, it was too late," Brooke went on as a still semi-conscious Sam listened.</p>
<p>&lt;God, Nic was right!&gt;</p>
<p>"Nicole, Nicole who KNEW how I felt, who HAD known for a while how I felt about you USED it against me and went after you herself. And while I knew I still could have told you how I felt, especially given the fact that your relationship with Nicole wasn?t really what you and I would call a ?relationship?, I was still scared," Brooke confessed softly.</p>
<p>&lt;*snort* You and me both, Brooke. I wanted you and settled for Satan. Looks like we both got burned. Damn that peroxide bitch&gt; Sam thought angrily. She tried to surface further, she wanted to be able to actually talk back to Brooke, share her own feelings, but she lacked the energy to do so. So she sat back and listened as Brooke continued.</p>
<p>"So I hid behind the excuse of not wanting to pull you in two directions. I wanted to see you happy and I thought that you were. As much as I loved you, I was still too scared of you not loving me back. I couldn?t handle that, Sam. I still can?t," Brooke went on.</p>
<p>&lt;You don?t need to worry, Brooke&gt; Sam thought desperately. &lt;I DO love you&gt; She wanted to shout but her body wouldn?t respond to her. She heard Brooke?s voice continuing.</p>
<p>"But I need to tell you this now, I have to get it off my chest. I?ve come too close to losing you and it frightened me. Even if you don?t remember a word I?ve said, I?LL know that I?ve said it and that?s enough." Sam heard Brooke take a deep cleansing breath and took one of her own.</p>
<p>"I love you Samantha McPherson. With all my heart and soul," Brooke said with such conviction that Sam had no doubt that it was the truth. And it warmed the last frozen edges of her body to hear those words from Brooke. Using the last of her dwindling strength, Sam moved herself as close to Brooke as she could get and let out the breath she was holding, hoping to let Brooke know that she heard her and felt the same way before unconsciousness stole her away once more.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke woke a while later to find Sam shaking again, this time from a fever. She called for Lily who came into the room.</p>
<p>"Have you heard anything from the Rescue Squad or Carmen and the others?" Brooke asked as Sam tossed fitfully in her arms. Lily shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>"No, and the storm has gotten worse, Brooke," Lily explained. "How is she?" she asked looking over at Sam.</p>
<p>"I think we?ve got her re-warmed but now she?s developed a fever. I think being out in the cold and wet, she?s getting sick," Brooke said as she shifted on the bed for a better hold on Sam.</p>
<p>"Br?ke," Sam mumbled as the blonde moved.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sam, I?m right here," Brooke whispered to her.</p>
<p>"Don? leave me," Sam begged as she latched onto Brooke as tightly as she could in her weakened state. Tears pricked at Brooke?s eyes at the desperateness in Sam?s voice. She kissed Sam?s hot forehead and sighed.</p>
<p>"I promise you that I?m not, Sammy," she said. "Lily, can you get me some more clean clothes for her and a cold compress?" Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"Sure thing, Brooke. Be right back," the Latina said before leaving to do as she was asked. She knew Sam was in good hands with Brooke and would do whatever she had to to help Brooke see Sam through.</p>
<p>"Hang in there, Sammy. You?re doing great," Brooke encouraged.</p>
<p>"How is she?" Nicole asked quietly from the doorway. Brooke turned her attention from the sick girl to the blonde in the door and glared.</p>
<p>"She?s sick now, no thanks to you," she snarled. "Hypothermia didn?t get her but pneumonia still might if we don?t get her to the hospital soon."</p>
<p>"God, I am so sorry. I never meant for all this to happen, Brooke. You have to believe me," Nicole begged. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"The only thing I have to believe is that Sam is going to be all right. Beyond that is anyone?s guess. Now please leave," she said curtly. Nicole wiped away an errant tear and nodded. She left just as Lily returned.</p>
<p>"Here are some more clothes," she said as she set them down on the bed and handed Brooke a cool compress, which she pressed gently against Sam?s fevered brow. "Brooke, don?t vilify the poor girl. She really is remorseful. She feels terrible enough as it is. I think she really does care for Sam in her own way." Brooke ran her hand through her hair and sighed.</p>
<p>"I know. But I also know that if she hadn?t played this stupid game to begin with, Sam wouldn?t be sick and hurt right now. This is essentially her fault. And I need to blame someone so that I don?t feel so damn guilty."</p>
<p>"I understand," Lily said. "I?ll leave so you can change Sam. Call if you need anything."</p>
<p>"I will," Brooke turned back to Sam as Lily left. "Let?s get you into clean clothes again Sammy." Her only response was a mumbled groan that she didn?t understand completely. But at least Sam seemed to be responding to her. She got Sam changed again and huddled under the covers as the shakes from the fever overtook the slim brunette and she started to whimper. Brooke started to sing softly to Sam as she lay down beside her and it seemed to calm Sam somewhat.</p>
<p>"I?m sorry your vacation turned out so badly, Sam," she said softly, placing a gently kiss to Sam?s sweat dampened temple. "I wanted it to be so special for you. I know that your dad was very special to you and I wanted this memory of him, of his promise to be special too. I?m very sorry." She faded off to an exhausted sleep shortly afterward, draped carefully over Sam, keeping her safe.</p>
