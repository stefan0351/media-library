<!-- The Better Life \ Chapter 3: Ready For The Goodtimes -->

<p>Buffy just finished mopping the floor and was heading for the bathroom for a
shower as her sisters and mom walked in the front door, all laden with bags.
Buffy ignored them quickly running to the bathroom and jumping in the shower
so that they would think she had been in it a while, therefore could not make
her get out.  Sure enough she was hardly in there a minute before she heard
the bathroom door open and Cordelia was yelling.</p>
<p>"You better be almost done, we have to get ready for the party.  Why did you
wait so long to get in the shower anyway we have been gone over two hours,
couldn't you have done it earlier?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, I'll be out soon," Buffy yelled back.</p>
<p>"You better."  Cordelia slammed the door.  Buffy showered quickly and
wrapping a towel around herself darted down the hall to her room.  Shutting
the door she changed into a pair of sweats, and a tank top.  As she brushed
her hair, Dawn threw her bedroom door open, slamming it against the bed.
Dawn leaned against the door.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you asked mom if you could go to the party.  Please," Dawn
rolled her eyes.  "I mean look at you."</p>
<p>"Shut up, I am not going anywhere, why would I get dressed up?"  Buffy
answered still brushing her hair.</p>
<p>"No need to get mouthy, I am just saying, it's not like you have a chance
with anyone there."  Dawn left, laughing at the thought of Buffy going to the
party.  Buffy sat her hairbrush down and picked up a little hand mirror
looking at herself.  She didn't think she was ugly, at least no more so then
her stepsisters.</p>
<p>"Buffy come help us!"  Cordelia yelled, rolling her eyes Buffy went to
Cordelias room.  Dawn and Cordelia were rapidly pulling clothes out of their
bags.  Buffy helped them pick out their outfits, and put up their hair.  She
was surprised by the expensive clothes her stepmother had bought them.  Even
though they always got better things then her, her mother rarely splurged for
the truly expensive stuff.  But Dawn had a pair of Dark blue jeans that laced
up the front, and a tiny white tank top with Guess scrawled across the front
in iridescent writing.  Cordelia had a pair of tight black Tommy jeans and a
low cut red tank top.  They each wore tall chunky shoes.  Buffy had to admit
they looked good, maybe one of them would meet someone tonight, least then
they'd be out of the house more.  Buffy went back to her room as they
finished their make up; soon her stepmother knocked on the door.  She was
dressed trashy as usual for her date.</p>
<p>"Alright we're leaving, don't let anyone in, don't go anywhere, don't wait
up, we'll be back late, her stepmother walked away and was replaced by her
two stepsisters leering in her doorway.</p>
<p>"Bye Buffy, have fun," Dawn said in a sing song voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah, isn't Sabrina on or something?"  Cordelia and Dawn laughed as they
walked away, Buffy heard the front door shut and got up slamming her own door
shut, she threw herself down on her bed.  It just wasn't fair!  They were
evil, but they got everything they wanted.  She did everything around the
house and was lucky to have their hand me downs, practically the only thing
she ever got new of her own were tampons, and shoes, and the shoes were from
payless, and only when they had sales.  Where was the justice?  Despite her
best efforts, Buffy felt tears start to fall down her cheeks.  Just not fair.</p>
<p>She was dimly aware of a bright flash and then some added weight on her bed;
she sat bolt upright when a hand started stroking her back.</p>
<p>"What the hell??"  Buffy stared open mouthed at the two girls on the bed with
her.  "You're the Olsen twins!!"  Buffy tried to scramble away from them to
the head of her bed.</p>
<p>"Hey, calm down, it's all right," Mary-Kate said, holding up her hand to show
her they meant no harm.</p>
<p>"Yeah, were here to help, we're your fairy godmothers," Ashley said smiling.
"My huh?"  Buffy looked at them in disbelief.</p>
<p>"Well something like that I mean you are older so that makes it hard for us
to be God mothers, so maybe God sisters?  Cousins?"</p>
<p>"Ashley, stop," Mary-Kate held up a hand to her sister to stop her babble,
she moved up to sit next to Buffy resting a hand on her knee.  "Listen we are
here to help, you need to go to this party, we have to help get you there."
"Yeah, you are like so destined to fall in love."</p>
<p>"Ashley!  Anyway, so here we are, now we gotta get you dressed, what do you
have?"</p>
<p>"Well not a lot actually, nothing to go to a party in and hope to impress
someone," Buffy looked down sadly.</p>
<p>"Totally no problem, lets see," Ashley said digging through the trunk of
clothes, Mary-Kate went to help her.  She pulled out a pair of torn up jeans,
and Ashley pulled out a shirt.  They each took a hair clip out and tapped the
clothes.  Buffy couldn't believe her eyes.  In place of her own clothes, now
on the bed there was a pair of jeans in perfect condition, they were frayed
along the waist, and laced from the knee down on either side, and a white
tank top with sparkles all over it.</p>
<p>"How the?  What the?"  Buffy stared at the clothes in front of her, they were
nicer then any she had ever owned.</p>
<p>"Oh, go on, try them on," Ashley bounced excitedly.  Buffy quickly changed
into the clothes.  The three of them went into Cordelias room to use the
full-length mirror. Buffy gasped at herself, the pants fit her slim form
perfectly, and hung low on her hips, the shirt was cut so as to show off a
hint of her cleavage, and a lot of her toned stomach.  Her blonde hung
silkily over her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Nice," Mary-Kate said looking over her shoulder, so about ready to go then?"
She asked.</p>
<p>"I think, oh, but I need shoes."</p>
<p>"Duh, Mary-Kate went into the other room, and returned with a pair of silver
and red sneakers that Buffy had never seen before.  On the side of them there
was a Nike swoosh, and under that written 'Glass'.  She handed them to Buffy,
who gingerly put them on, they fit perfectly.  Buffy looked at the side of
them.</p>
<p>"Nike Glass?  Those are so expensive!"</p>
<p>"Whatever, it's nothing," Ashley waved her hand dismissively.  "Now you gotta
be back by midnight...I don't know why they haven't changed that with the
times, I mean all the good parties usually don't get started till then, but
lucky you this one starts early."</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's only almost eight now so that gives you," Mary-Kate thought for a
minute, "Four hours, then all of this turns back to what it was before."</p>
<p>"Ok, I can do that, but how am I going to get to the party?"  Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Mary-Kate, you forget everything," Ashley said shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I do not!  Here is ten bucks for a cab, our magic budget has gone down, so
we don't do that whole pumpkin thing any more, I mean carriages were easy,
but you try to turn a pumpkin into a Jag and you are taking big time mess.
So go on now."</p>
<p>"Thank you solo much!"  Buffy hugged them each in turn and waked out the
front door where a cab was waiting.  'Well here goes nothing,' she thought as
she stepped into the cab and gave the driver the address.</p>
<p>"She was cute," Mary-Kate said standing in the door of the trailer.</p>
<p>"Think she'll get a happy ending?" Asked Ashley.</p>
<p>"Don't they always?" Mary-Kate answered.  "Lattes?"</p>
<p>"Sure," The two shut the trailer door and started down the block.</p>
