<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 1-->

<p>Brooke made a conscious effort not to look to her left as she sensed someone
side into the seat next to her.  Of course it wasn't just someone, Brooke
knew exactly who it was, it was Sam McPherson, her soon to be step-sister
and her-at least as far as Brooke was concerned-unwillingly arch nemesis.
Sam had made it to class just in time, yet again.  Brooke found it amusing
that someone so orderly, and dare she even think it, anal, was perpetually
late for class.  Even though she knew that it was unwise, Brooke was
seriously considering offering a greeting to the girl beside her when
Mr./Ms. Glass-nobody was really certain which one it was which was
especially disconcerting seeing as 'it' taught biology-stood up ready to
address the class.  Brooke sighed, when 'it' addressed the class nothing
good ever followed.  The interruption was probably helpful though, while
they had just recently bonded with Brooke encouraging Sam to wait before
leaping into a sexual relationship-which she had done and as a result had
hurt herself and her former boyfriend emotionally-they still weren't
friends.</p>

<p>"Well class, it's nice to see that you were all able to drag yourselves out
of bed this morning and grace me with your slovenly presences once again,"
Glass said moving from behind the desk.  "From the haggard looks on all of
your faces I'd say that once again you're all reaping the effects of yet
another weekend wasted wallowing in the depths of debauchery and
slothfulness."</p>

<p>Brooke looked up as the teacher walked by her desk then quickly ducked her
head down again.  She knew without a doubt that this was going to be a
particularly heinous class.</p>

<p>"Today's lesson," Glass went on as (s)he made his/her rounds, "is about
attraction.  Animal and otherwise," (s)he continued chuckling at his/her own
joke.</p>

<p>"Good one M'!"</p>

<p>"Shut up Phelps," Glass replied cutting off the butt kisser's comment.  "If
I want to hear your opinion I'll write it down and give it to you."</p>

<p>Brooke heard a soft sound off to her left and chanced a glance.  Sam was
smirking-while trying not to look like she was smirking-and shaking her
head.  This was her usual reaction when Glass kicked a butt kisser in the
butt.  Brooke watched her for a moment then turned away before Sam could see
her and start World War Three.  It always amazed Brooke how much more human
Sam looked when she wasn't crusading but just acting like a normal teenager.</p>

<p>"Attraction," Glass was saying, "can be a good thing and very bad thing.  As
I'm sure you all know it can lead to mono, pregnancy, syphilis, gonorrhea
and a pantheon of other delightful diseases."</p>

<p>Brooke tuned out after that choosing instead to read the section marked in
their textbooks.  She really didn't want to have to deal with one of Glass's
sardonic and bitter diatribes.</p>

<p>A few moments later Brooke noticed a movement to her left and turned her
head slightly.  Sam was scratching something in her notebook.  Brooke
wondered if it was another exposé.  The thought of that made her shutter.
Leaning over a bit more she tried and failed to look discretely at the piece
of paper.  It was a drawing, a good one.  It had people standing over butter
turns and holding pitchforks.  It looked like a period piece, but there was
something off about it.  Brooke smiled mentally, knowing Sam it was probably
some kind of-how did Sam put it that time-'social commentary the likes of
which her frontal lobe wasn't big enough to comprehend'.</p>

<p>"Do you mind?" Brooke looked up into Sam's scowling face and shifted away
from her.</p>

<p>"Sorry," she muttered softly.  She looked up and Sam was still
scowling-apparently she had a natural talent for that.  "It was just good
that's all," she went on lowering her gaze back to her books and picking up
her pen.</p>

<p>Sam's eyebrow rose and she found herself staring at Brooke's now subdued
form.  The girl she had once not so lovingly referred to as a 'rich, bitch
elitist ice queen'-honourable mention going to John Cage-had just
complimented her doodle.  Sam pouted and turned away, she really hated it
when the girl did things like that.  They were enemies they weren't suppose
to be nice to each other, it just complicated things terribly.  Brooke
McQueen, the Queen bee everywhere she ever went, wasn't supposed to like
her, and she wasn't supposed to like Brooke either.  And then something like
what just happened there would happen and complicate things, making Sam feel
like a fascist while Brooke got off smelling like roses.</p>

<p>Sam watched from across the hall as Brooke disappeared into the washroom.
Pushing off of the wall she was leaning against she made her way over.  She
had been standing there for the last fifteen minutes and she hadn't seen
anyone go in, which meant that Brooke would be in there alone, and once she
got in there they'd be in there alone.</p>

<p>Sam had decided sometime between first and last period that she wanted to be
the one smelling like roses for a change and let Brooke see what it was like
to feel like something the cat drug in!  Well, that and the fact that she
actually did feel bad, though she wouldn't admit that to anyone but
herself-and even that was grudgingly.</p>

<p>"Hey," Sam greeted standing behind Brooke who was positioned in front of
vanity mirror.</p>

<p>Brooke looked up and spotted Sam's image in the mirror.  It took all of the
self-control she possessed not groan in agony at the sight of the brunette.</p>

<p>"Whatcha doing?" Sam asked in a friendly tone as she smiled at the blonde
girl.</p>

<p>Brooke eyed Sam nervously, she was acting bizarrely.  Looking at the smile
she had plastered across her face Brooke half expected her to start skipping
while singing 'trah la la".</p>

<p>"Nothing much," Brooke answered carefully trying to feel Sam out.</p>

<p>Sam nodded and moved towards Brooke who flinched away.  Sam stopped moving
when she noticed the reaction and quirked her eyebrow up comically.</p>

<p>"Friendly piece of advice, you might want to switch to decafe," Sam said
eyeing Brooke with the same annoyingly amused expression she had on her face
before she started speaking.</p>

<p>"Is there something that I can do for you?" Brooke asked turning away from
the grinning idiot.</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded taking a deep breath.  "But there's something I can do
for you."</p>

<p>"Really?" Brooke asked.  "What?  Build a time machine and not be born?"</p>

<p>"No," Sam responded suddenly wondering if this was such a good idea after
all.  Time had shown that while she and Brooke could bond for a moment or
two sustained contact usually led to an earth shattering kaboom.  "I was
just going to apologize for..." Sam paused here gathering all of her courage,
"my rudeness in bio today.  I'm sorry that I snapped at you."</p>

<p>Brooke looked-actually gaped-at Sam after the brunette had finished
speaking.  In the entire time they had spoken/fought/known each other Brooke
wasn't sure that Sam had once issued an outright apology.  When Sam wrote an
exposé that got the cheerleaders budget severely cut, she didn't apologize.
When Sam wrote an article-which she promised not print then printed
anyway-on cheating that nailed Brooke's friend's-and as Brooke had revealed
in a heartfelt conversation that she thought had brought Sam and herself
closer together, had nailed her too-she didn't apologize.  When Sam-though
inadvertently-was responsible for the widespread distribution of a picture
of Brooke with the flu during the homecoming race, she still didn't outright
apologize.  And now, now she was apologizing for being snappish!  It made
absolutely no sense whatsoever.  It was lunacy!</p>

<p>"I...you...for...when...what?" Brooke finally managed to sputter out.</p>

<p>Sam decided to ignore the blonde's incoherent reply and continue.</p>

<p>"I was hoping that I could make it up to you," Sam responded smiling
mentally as Brooke gaped at her once again.</p>

<p>"I...you...for," Brooke stopped speaking and composed herself.  She wasn't going
to let Sam McPherson completely lower her to the level of a sputtering
idiot.  "How?"</p>

<p>"With the parental units...away," Sam said making a face at the thought of her
mother and Brooke's father away on a romantic retreat, "I thought that...if
you weren't busy...I'd make dinner," Sam finished getting straight to the
point before her spine could completely leave her body.</p>

<p>"Dinner?" Brooke questioned suspiciously.</p>

<p>"That's what I said," Sam confirmed.  It was time to start smelling like
roses.</p>

<p>"Alright," Brooke said crossing her arms.</p>

<p>"Good," Sam responded.</p>

<p>"Fine then," Brooke replied.</p>

<p>"Great," Sam said smiling.</p>

<p>After that they stood there in silence for a moment watching each other.
Then Sam turned and quickly made her way out of the washroom.  Ha!</p>
