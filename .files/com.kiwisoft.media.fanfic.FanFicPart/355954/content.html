Of course the women had planned for many contingencies... including the Borg force field that only let B'Elanna and Seven out the door.</p>

		<p>"Shall we dine in the messhall B'Elanna?" Seven asked as she took her hand.</p>

		<p>"Anything you want BangwI, anything at all."  B'Elanna smiled.</p>

		<p>Seven stopped, and snickered.  It was a human affectation she knew she could allow around B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"Listen."  Seven said and pointed to the door.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna leaned over closer to the door and grinned when she heard the Doctor's voice belting out in Klingon.</p>

		<p>"I think we ought to ask him to sing at our wedding... what do you think?"</p>

		<p>Seven blinked at B'Elanna.  B'Elanna grinned and winked.</p>

		<p>"Just kidding."</p>
