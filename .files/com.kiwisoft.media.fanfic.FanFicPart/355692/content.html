<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Twenty-Nine -->

<p>Kara stood looking out over Puget Sound, unseeing, as the ferry took her to
			Seattle. A party. She didn't feel like a party. She didn't feel much like
			anything, but Marsha had talked her into it. A bunch of their old friends would
			be there, she had said.</p>
		<p>"Big deal," Kara muttered. She glanced to the west, the sun still hanging on,
			dipping into the sea as it fought with the clouds that brought a slow drizzle.
			And the colors were magnificent. But she could find little joy in them this
			evening. She turned her face away and cupped her hands, flicking a flame to her
			cigarette.</p>
		<p>She drove through the wet streets, thoughts of Ginny crowding her mind and
			she pushed them all away.</p>
		<p>"Jesus, look at you," Marsha said, drawing Kara inside. "You look like
			shit."</p>
		<p>"Thanks."</p>
		<p>"I mean it. When's the last time you've eaten?"</p>
		<p>Kara shrugged, slipping another cigarette between her lips. Marsha watched
			her, concern showing on her face. "I've never seen you this way, Kara. I'm
			worried about you."</p>
		<p>"Please," Kara said and rolled her eyes. "I'm fine."</p>
		<p>"Why don't you call her?" Marsha asked gently.</p>
		<p>Kara shook her head. "No." She took a deep drag off her cigarette. "I'm
			extremely happy being miserable."</p>
