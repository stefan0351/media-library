<!-- New Frontier \ Part 3 -->

<p>B'Elanna Torres sat in her office in engineering, looking over the reports from the previous shifts, but having an otherwise difficult time trying to concentrate. Tom had granted her request for a divorce, and for that she was as pleased as one could be when their life is ripped apart. She had read somewhere once that divorces on Earth during the 20th and early 21st centuries caused so much stress that they were second only the death of a dearly loved one. She felt like she was going through that same stress. True, it was much easier to get a divorce in the 24th Century but it was no less painful.</p>

		<p>She had loved Tom, and now she wasn't so sure. That's what got her most. Before they were married, she could put up with almost anything. She would cuss and fight with him, but eventually she would take him back and the whole process would begin again. Why didn't she fight this time? She gave up so easily and asked for a divorce. Not only that, she had gone running to the captain about it, crying on her shoulder for hours on end. She had even allowed Seven, the ice princess, to comfort her, washing her hair and back as if she was a child.</p>

		<p>And now, she sat alone in her rarely used office, hiding from the world when she should have been realigning something somewhere, along with the rest of her team. She had been hiding since the beginning of her shift, seven hours before. She couldn't face the whispers and sympathetic looks, even though they were few and far between. She still could have sworn she saw a look coming from Vorik, a Vulcan, when he arrived for duty.</p>

		<p>The door of her office chimed and she called for them to come in. It was Seven, her back impossibly straight, her gaze impassive, her curves...</p>

		<p>Seven had spent the day before with her, washing her hair first, cooking her a wonderful breakfast with banana pancakes to rival her grandmother's, and then including her in her activities with Naomi. No matter how much she didn't want to admit it, she actually enjoyed spending time with Flotter and Treevis, and even Seven and Naomi. Especially Seven. Once they had left the captain's, Seven did not once bring up Tom or any recent breakup. She did not even tell B'Elanna that she could talk to her if she needed to. Instinctively, however, she knew that she could trust Seven to be objective, trustworthy and even silent. She didn't know how she knew that, she just knew. Maybe it was because she had spent so much time with the captain and no one knew of their activities. Seven never supported or denied any claims of a sexual relationship with her captain. She just let the rumors be. B'Elanna had to respect the girl for that.</p>

		<p>"Whatcha need, Seven?" B'Elanna said curtly, warmth hinting I her eyes..</p>

		<p>"You have been working for seven hours and have not taken a nutritional supplement. Also, you did not eat breakfast this morning. You must take care of yourself, Lt. Torres. It is imperative to me that you do so," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"To you?"</p>

		<p>Seven blushed. >What the hell? I didn't think the Borg could blush,' B'Elanna thought.</p>

		<p>"I consider you to be a friend, Lieutenant, and do not wish to see you harmed in any way. To be so would not only subject me to hardship, but to the ship and her crew. You are very important to the survival to this vessel."</p>

		<p>"A friend?"</p>

		<p>"Yes." Seven didn't explain herself.</p>

		<p>"Thanks, Seven. I'll eat something."</p>

		<p>"Would you like to accompany me to the messhall? Neelix is serving tacos and fajitas tonight. I believe he calls it Mexican Fiesta Night."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna chuckled. She never thought that she'd hear that combination of words from Seven's mouth, let alone the entire conversation.</p>

		<p>"I would love to," B'Elanna said, a smile on her face that was quickly matched by Seven's toothy grin. Again, B'Elanna nearly fell over with surprise, but she took it all in stride and followed the tall blonde out of engineering and to the turbolift.</p>

		<p>They didn't make it to the messhall, however. The violent rocking of the ship and the shut down of the turbolift saw to that.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Report," Janeway ordered in her most stern voice as she exited her ready room.</p>

		<p>"Ship decloaking off of the starboard bow. It has fired on us," Tuvok said impassively. "Damage only to the deflector grid."</p>

		<p>"Shields! Hail them," Janeway barked.</p>

		<p>"No response."</p>

		<p>"Their weapons have been charged again."</p>

		<p>"Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>The ship twisted and turned throughout space as Tom tried to avoid the supposed enemy ship and its weapons fire. They were only clipped once by the disruptors, but it was enough to kick their shields down to 6%.</p>

		<p>"Enemy vessel, you have crossed our path. You must stand down and prepare to be boarded," came the metallic voice over the intercom. Harry hadn't even had the chance to patch a channel through.</p>

		<p>"We had no idea that we were in your path, but we will not stand down and you will not board us. Perhaps we can come to a diplomatic solution."</p>

		<p>"Diplomacy is weak! You will stand down!" The channel went dead and the ship fired again.</p>

		<p>"This is pissing me off," Janeway said under breath. "Target their weapons and fire at will. Full phasers then let's get the hell out of here."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," Tuvok said as he did exactly as she said. Unfortunately, they were a little more resilient than Voyager was. The phaser fire only served as a fly on their nose, but it was enough to distract them. Tom took the opportunity to warp out of there at the highest speed possible. Janeway wasn't in the mood for fighting that day. It wasn't a good day to die.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"What the hell was that?" B'Elanna said into the total darkness of the turbolift.</p>

		<p>"It seems as though we are being attacked," Seven replied before she bumped into B'Elanna. She couldn't say that it was an unpleasant sensation.</p>

		<p>"And the turbolifts go down? Kahless."</p>

		<p>"Why do you continually refer to Kahless? He will be of no help with the turbolifts."</p>

		<p>"It's a curse, Seven. It's like when humans say >Oh my God' or >Jesus Christ' or something. Can you see anything?"</p>

		<p>"Nothing. My optical implant requires some light to operate in the dark. However, there is no light in here."</p>

		<p>"Are we still in the turbolift?"</p>

		<p>Seven reached out and felt the walls, and then something decidedly more soft. A yelp from the other passenger told her what she had put her hand on. She made a retreat.</p>

		<p>"I... I... I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I did not realize that was your breast."</p>

		<p>"Well, stop feeling around like a blind man at the beach and stand still," B'Elanna said, not entirely flustered by the hand that was momentarily on her breast. Even though Seven had been feeling for the wall, her touch was gentle, and for a second, welcome. Tom had never touched her like that and, for a moment, she remembered the previous day's bath and how Seven had been with her that time, too.</p>

		<p>"I am essentially blind, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"So am I and please call me B'Elanna." >I like the sound of my name coming off of your lips,' she thought secretly. >You never whine.=</p>

		<p>B'Elanna shook her head and then reached out to the wall for support, only to find a softer support and it was breathing.</p>

		<p>"I am having difficulties trying to concentrate, B'Elanna, especially with your hand on my chest," Seven said, her voice breathy and full of desire. B'Elanna didn't move her hand.</p>

		<p>"Why?" Seven didn't reply with words, she simply sought out B'Elanna's hand with hers and held it to her chest, lightly stroking the back with her thumb. B'Elanna stepped closer and leaned into the caress only to have Seven touch her forehead and trace her ridges with her Borg hand.</p>

		<p>"You are very beautiful, B'Elanna," Seven breathed. "Even in the dark."</p>

		<p>"Why am I feeling this way?" B'Elanna asked, her voice catching. The emotion was too heady. She found herself breathing in Seven's scent, only to find that it was the same as the sheets Kathryn had given her two nights before. But there was another scent underneath it, a metallic tang on top of blood and a woman's desire. She couldn't tell if the desire was her own or if it was Seven's, but she knew that the blood was the blonde's and she wanted to taste it. She didn't want to take it, though, she wanted Seven to give it to her.</p>

		<p>Seven took B'Elanna in her arms and stroked her back. Her warm breath danced across B'Elanna's forehead.</p>

		<p>"I would very much like to kiss you," Seven said. B'Elanna responded kissing her neck, up her jaw and instinctively found her lips. They pressed together, content in the slight contact until desire won over and tongues found each other across lips and teeth. B'Elanna purred deep in her throat and chest, and seven came back with a moan into her mouth.</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon put her hands on Seven's behind and massaged it, kneaded it like bread. One of Seven's legs wrapped around B'Elanna's, pressing her centre onto the Chief Engineer's hip. Soon, Seven's back was up against the wall and B'Elanna held her up off the ground, trying desperately to get further inside the Borg.</p>

		<p>"Oh, God, I love you," B'Elanna whispered despite herself. She continued to kiss the woman until the lights turned on and the doors opened to the bridge. And that's where the entire bridge compliment, including Tom Paris, found them.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna turned bright red as she slipped Seven down the wall. Seven straightened her hair.</p>

		<p>"Ladies," Janeway said with a ever so slight smirk on her face.</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am," B'Elanna squeaked.</p>

		<p>"Ready room, please."</p>

		<p>They both nodded and followed the captain to her inner sanctum. The doors shut and B'Elanna instantly felt that she was a part of some inquisition.</p>

		<p>"Care to explain yourselves?"</p>

		<p>"The turbolift and the lights went out. We became >carried away," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Lt. Torres, you have repairs to see to in engineering. I want a full report at the staff meeting in one hour. Please try to be a little more discrete in the future. Tom still is a bridge officer on this crew."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna turned on her heel and left.</p>

		<p>"I thought you were going to wait before you said or did anything."</p>

		<p>"I was," Seven replied. "I did not tell her how I felt. She got so close, Kathryn. I cannot explain..." The Borg began to cry. It would be something that the rest of the crew would never see, but Janeway had seen it before. She had seen it whenever B'Elanna hurt her young charge with a harsh word or an unexplained fight.</p>

		<p>"Did she take advantage of you?" Kathryn asked as she put an arm around her shoulders.</p>

		<p>"No, I asked her to kiss me. It just happened. Kathryn, she said that she loved me. How can she love me when she loved Ensign Paris two days ago?"</p>

		<p>"Love for others doesn't stop just because you are married or involved with someone. It's just how you deal with it. Maybe she loved you al along. Maybe she was caught up in the moment. I can't explain it, darling. You need to talk to her. That's the only way you'll ever know."</p>

		<p>"I am afraid."</p>

		<p>"Of what?"</p>

		<p>"Of giving my heart to her and having her rip it apart. I do not believe that I can function without her."</p>

		<p>"People have been feeling like this for millennia, Seven, and no one has ever been able to give advice sage enough to counteract a heartbreak. But if you don't take that chance, you might never feel her love in return."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded and wiped away her tears. She left without saying goodbye or waiting to be dismissed. She had some things to think about and decide. Would it ever be love for B'Elanna, or was it just lust like in the turbolift? What she said could have been just a reaction to the situation. Seven didn't know if she could trust it or not, even despite what the captain had said.</p>
