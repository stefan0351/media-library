<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 29 -->

<p>“Just, let it go.” Mike said softly.  Jane had been trying to tell him
something for the better part of ten minutes, and he still had no idea what
she was talking about.  He had noticed that she had seemed preoccupied for
the past week or so, but he had assumed that it had to do with the wedding
preparations.  Now he wasn’t so sure.</p>

<p>“It started with this pamphlet I found,” Jane said finally just putting it
out there.  She needed to talk to Mike about this as it would eventually
effect him too.  She had put off talking to him about it because all she had
was circumstantial evidence.  All she still had was circumstantial evidence,
but it was good circumstantial evidence she had come to realize.  She was
also, she realized, looking for a bit of encouragement.  She had meant to
talk to Sam about it, but the few times the opportunity had arisen she’d
hadn’t the heart to bring it up directly or even indirectly.</p>

<p>“Pamphlet?”</p>

<p>“In Sam’s bedroom,” Jane answered pensively.  “I swear I was just tiding up
bit…I’m not one of ‘those’ moms,” she went on.  She had had one of those
moms and she swore she wouldn’t be one of the mom/amateur detective mothers
who slipped into their children’s room after they went of to school looking
for naughty bits to hold over their heads.</p>

<p>“What was it about?” Mike asked wondering what could possibly have upset
Jane so much.  Pamphlet’s were harmless weren’t they, mostly about healthy
eating and study tips.  Surely that hadn’t agitated her. He wished he would
find a pamphlet!</p>

<p>“Same sex relationships.  A romantic guide for the other ten per cent,” Jane
related shifting her position once again, her voice lowering unconsciously.
When she realized what she’d done, she straightened up a little.  Damn,
social conditioning!</p>

<p>“Huh?” Mike questioned elegantly as always.</p>

<p>“I know,” Jane responded shaking her head helplessly.  “It was basically a
gay guide.”</p>

<p>“Sam’s?” Mike asked a moment later forcing himself to calm down.  Jane was
already worked up enough, he didn’t need to go adding to her anxiety.  He
really hadn’t expected her to say that.  Then again, he considered, it
wasn’t the type of thing that people went around expecting.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Jane answered lowering her gaze to the table top.  “It’s most
definitely Sam’s.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Mike started carefully, “she’s just curious.  Teens these days are
curious, and it’s even kind of trendy, what with Ally McBeal doing it and
Jon Voight’s daughter and all,” he continued.</p>

<p>Brooke’s hand ran down Sam’s torso slowly, her fingers dancing across Sam’s
shirt then wrapping tightly around her waist as she drew them closer
together.  Sam melted into the body behind her, grinding against Brooke as
the blonde lowered her face to Sam’s necks and smiled against the slick skin
there.</p>

<p>“Come on,” Brooke whispered playfully into Sam’s ear.  “You can do it, put
your back into it,” she continued pushing her hips against Sam’s ass
erotically.</p>

<p>Sam grinned and lifted her left hand up looping it around Brooke’s neck,
tangling her fingers in the blonde hair for a moment before turning herself
around so that they were facing each other.  Brooke’s lips parted sexily, a
small gasp coming out of her mouth as she took in Sam’s wicked grin and her
hotly disheveled appearance.  Her brown locks were slightly tussled and
there was a thin sheen of sweat glistening all over her body.  She had a
flustered, yet excited energy surrounding her, and Brooke found herself
unconsciously leaning forward.  To put it as succinctly as possible, Brooke
wanted some of that.</p>

<p>Sam pulled back teasingly.  “What was that about putting my back in to it?”
she asked, dancing out of Brooke’s reach.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” the blonde responded immediately.  “I liked where your back was,
I don’t know what I was thinking,” she continued pulling a willingly Sam
back against her.</p>

<p>
“Will you look at them,” Carmen commented leaning against the bar and
shaking her head.  After being accosted by some drunken men (and one woman)
shortly after arriving she had made her way over to the bar thinking that
the experience would be much more enjoyable with a few drinks in her.
Unfortunately she found out that she was melancholy drunk, and after briefly
sampling the available male inhabitants of the club, she had resigned
herself to watching Brooke and Sam heat up the dance floor moodily.</p>

<p>“And us without our fire-hose,” Lily responded with a smirk after spotting
their friends on the dance floor.  Having just returned from doing some
networking Lily hadn’t had the opportunity to observe what the love birds
had been up to.  However, getting her first look at them she could see why
half the club had their eyes trained on them.</p>

<p>“I want that,” Carmen stated longingly a moment, watching as Sam turned to
smile lovingly at Brooke.  They were just so goddamn cute together.  Always
looking at each other with those dopey bambi eyes, smiling and each other
intimately and exchanging tender touches.  If it weren’t so genuinely
touching seeing them together it would have pissed Carmen off.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid they’re already taken,” Lily commented though she admitted that
she wanted that too.  Though, she had to admit that everybody probably
wanted love, and that the kind Brooke and Sam seemed to have was of the best
variety.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean with either of them,” Carmen responded turning to glare at
Lily.</p>

<p>“Then why are you standing here talking to me?” Lily asked with an impish
grin.  “The club is your oyster.  Brooke and Sam are certainly making the
most of the experience, and let’s not even mention Nicole,” Lily went on
turning to look at the short-haired blonde, who was encircled by smarmy
dancing men, nonetheless.  “I say we find ourselves some muffins and get if
not everlasting love then at least a few free drinks.”</p>

<p>Carmen turned to look at Brooke and Sam once more.  They were now draped
around each other like expensive silk.  Carmen sighed.  “Alright…but I feel
like I’ve just been sold the cheaper chicken.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s a phase,” Jane responded honestly holding his gaze. She
appreciated what he was trying to do, but she had been there and done that,
and she was fairly certain that her daughter was more than just curious, or
trendy.</p>

<p>“I won’t lie and say that I even considered this possibility, but…well, we
should be supportive.  I mean…with how things are, if is she, this is
probably hard for her,” Mike said haltingly.  He believed that his
suggestion was not only the mature thing to do but the right thing.  He had
heard that it was very confusing, and difficult for teens especially with an
alternative sexuality, and despite the tension that had existed between them
when the McPherson women first moved in, he had come to care a great deal
about Sam.  Plus, that was an teen pregnancy they wouldn’t have to worry
about.  He always liked to look at the glass as half-full.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Jane responded.  Nothing short of death would ever force her
away from her daughter, she was not going to condemn her child for who she
was, it just took a little getting used to.  As liberal as she liked to
consider herself to be, this really knocked the wind out of her.  “It’s just
been on my mind a lot since I found the pamphlet,” she continued deciding to
omit the her speculations about Sam’s feelings for Brooke until she had more
concrete evidence.  That information would just make things more complicated
and that probably wasn’t necessary since it was just a little unrequited
crush.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it’ll all work out,” Mike responded squeezing Jane’s hand and
smiling reassuringly.</p>
