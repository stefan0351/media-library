<P><B>Miley's P.O.V.</B></p>
<P>It's been nearly a week since my break-up with Jake, and I'm taking it a lot better than I thought I would have. I've spent nearly each day with Lilly and Oliver, hanging at the beach or the mall, and each night, Lilly would make me another rootbeer float, she spent the night one night, seeing as how her mom is still down in Texas, my dad didn't mind even though it was a school night. Jake hadn't dared come near me in the halls, best at just leaving me be, I ignored the obsessive fangirls, led by Amber and Ashley who were constantly blowing smoke out of their rear ends at me, shocked that I would "harm such a beautiful face" such as Jake Ryan's. I just rolled my eyes at them, I went through and torched all the things that Jake had ever given to me, alongside Lilly, and we laughed as we sang, very off-key, Picture To Burn and she made us more rootbeer floats. However, by Thursday, we'd run out of rootbeer and demolished most of her mothers stash of vanilla ice cream and my dad wouldn't purchase any so we decided to go low on it for now.</p>
<P>Meanwhile, I cant help but notice that my feelings toward Lilly have suddenly sprang into a new light, since the night at the movies, I've come to realize Lilly is all of the person I'd ever want to have in a real relationship, she's my best friend, and as weird as it struck me to find myself falling in love with a girl at first, now, it just didn't matter, because Lilly enjoyed preaching to me that I should do what makes me happy and not give a damn what other people think. I agreed whole-heartedly and decided to leave that part of embarrassment upto my alter-ego. Now the only question was, did I stand a chance with Lilly? Lilly hadn't been looking around for dates with any of our male peers since Lucas, and I partly dont blame her after he two-timed her, although she took it quite well, considering he was her first boyfriend, then not to mention that other guy, Matt? Mark? Whatever, who stood her up because she went from skater chick to glamour girl... okay that was my fault, but c'mon! That guy was just clueless. So here I sit, staring over at my best friend as we watch reruns on Saturday morning, eating bowls of cereal and wondering to myself how on Earth I was going to survive without telling Lilly. I was never good at keeping secrets, at least, not any secrets but Hannah, which even around Lilly I couldn't keep for long just because I was that open with her, I trusted her and I just couldn't stand lying. But now I had the issue of whether she'd still want to be my best friend if I told her I was falling in love with her. <I>Oh what a tangled web we weave</I>, I thought. Who wrote that again? I shook my head. Sometimes I dont understand even myself.</p>
<P><B>Lilly's P.O.V.</B></p>
<P>I wonder if she knows that I notice her staring at me? She's been acting quirky and odd all week, but I've tried to chalk it upto the fact she is still slightly grieving over her lost relationship with Jake, even though I'm proud to say she hasn't taken it as hard as she did that first night. I've managed to turn her into quite the independent woman in the last week, what with my charming skills and rootbeer floats, which my mom would most deffinitely be angry with me for having so many when she got back. Miley promised to help me get a new stock in before she got back Monday, though, so I wasn't worried. I wonder now, however, why Miley keeps staring? Do I have something on my face perhaps? Maybe another zit? I hope not! Could it be...<I> No, dream on Truscott, she'll never look at you that way.. then again there was that close call last week...</I> Oh no! Could she think that maybe I wanted to kiss her? And now she is afraid to tell me that she is completely grossed out by me? Ugh, this is just too confusing, I hate how I cant even understand myself anymore!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">-x-</p>
<P>By mid-afternoon, Miley and I had gone seperate ways, I headed home for a shower and to help clean up a bit around the house so my mom wouldn't come home to a complete mess. But strangely enough, the house seemed a whole lot emptier than when Miley was here with me, I sighed to myself, dreading thoughts of my future where I'd possibly own an apartment filled with cats, I knew that I could never let a guy into my heart, I just dont see them in that way anymore, sure I put on a facade for everyone else, especially Miley, I dont want them to know my little secret, and I just couldn't see myself loving really anyone but Miley, male or female. After heading out to the store and buying some more rootbeer I decided that I'd pay Miley another visit, hoping she wouldn't mind. I grabbed my skateboard and headed over, as I was nearing the house when I noticed the door was already open and I didn't bother to call in a Lilly landing.</p>
<P>I stopped my skateboard immediately when the sounds of the piano being played flowed out from the house and a soft melody voice was singing,</p>
<P>"<I>And its a long way down, its a long way down</I></p>
<P><I>its a long way down to the place where we started from...</I>"a few more notes were hit as I entered the house and I saw that the object of my affections was sitting at the piano, making beautiful music, I watched, transpired as she hit a few more notes, still unaware of my presence.</p>
<P>"<I>Your love is better than Ice Cream</I></p>
<P><I>better than anything else that I've tried</I></p>
<P><I>Your love is better than Ice Cream</I></p>
<P><I>everyone here knows how to cry...</I>"</p>
<P>I couldn't help but feel a smile creep onto my face as she worked through the lyrics and I wondered exactly where they had come from, I was snapped from my trance however when Miley finally noticed me standing there watching. A blush crept onto her cheeks and I smiled wider.</p>
<P>"That was beautiful, Miles,"I complimented.</p>
<P>"I didn't know you were there, how much did you hear?"she asked.</p>
<P>"Not much...,"I walked over and sat down next to her and noticed the sheet music, which she hastily made a grab for. "Who's the song for?"I asked, snatching what I could away and reading the lyrics.</p>
<P>"N-nobody! It's-"</p>
<P>"For me?"I asked. My eyes bulged as I noticed the head of the song read <I>Lilly's Serenade</I>. Miley remained quiet and it hit me, the song was about me, I looked to her and Miley was looking down at her hands in her lap, her cheeks burning bright red, I could see tears forming in her eyelids. I carefully placed the sheet music back on the piano and took her hands in my own. She didn't look up. "Miley... hey, c'mon, look at me?"she shook her head and sniffled. "Whats wrong?"</p>
<P>"Just.. just please leave, Lilly, I-I dont need-"</p>
<P>"Need what? Me?"I asked, hurt.</p>
<P>"No!"she half-yelled, and then snatched her hands away, standing. I remained where I was. "I-I dont need you to-to <I>hate</I> me."she crossed her arms defiantly, I could tell she was trying not to cry in front of me.</p>
<P>"Hate you? Miles, I could never-"</p>
<P>"You're telling me that y-you're not freaked out because I wrote this?"she challenged. I gave her a genuine smile.</p>
<P>"No, on the contrary, I'm flattered to know you feel something-"I offered. She finally locked eyes with me and her's grew wide as she scanned my face for any signs of deceit or trickery. I sighed. "Please play this for me, Miles?"I asked, hoping she'd sit back down, I didn't dare try to move, for fear she'd run. It took her a moment to think before she finally obliged and took a seat next to me. I smiled,</p>
<P><B>Miley's P.O.V.</B></p>
<P>I couldn't believe what was happening here, Lilly actually wasn't running away freaked. Of course, maybe she didn't understand the depths of the song, so I figured I might as well play it, seeing as how it was do or die. I clenched and unclenched my fists to relax my fingers before finally hitting a few notes and beginning to get into the rhythm, I forgot all about my worries, of how Lilly was right there, possibly for the last time willingly, and I began to softly sing my doubt away,</p>
<P>"<I>Your love is better than Ice Cream</I></p>
<P><I>better than anything else that I've tried.</I></p>
<P><I>And your love is better than Ice cream</I></p>
<P><I>everyone here knows how to fight</I></p>
<P><I>and its a long way down</I></p>
<P><I>its a long way down.</I></p>
<P><I>It's a long way down to the place</I></p>
<P><I>where we started from.</I></p>
<P><I>Your love is better than chocolate</I></p>
<P><I>better than anything else that I've tried.</I></p>
<P><I>Oh love is better than chocolate</I></p>
<P><I>everyone here knows how to cry</I></p>
<P><I>and its a long way down</I></p>
<P><I>its a long way down.</I></p>
<P><I>It's a long way down to the place</I></p>
<P><I>where we've started from..</I>"</p>
<P>I finished it off with a few hits of some keys, ending the melody, I didn't look upto see the reaction on Lilly's face as I kept my hands over the keys and I stared hard at the sheet music. I cant tell you how long it felt like before suddenly I felt Lilly move beside me and I shut my eyes against the onslaught of tears that threatened to fall, I waited to hear the door slam, but no such sound came, instead, my eyes snapped back open, misted with tears, at the soft feel of a warm hand interlacing with my own, I looked up and was startled to see tears of joy brimming in those beautiful aquamarine eyes, a smile written along Lilly's features.</p>
<P>"Lilly-"I didn't get a chance to finish as the softest pair of lips I'd ever felt, came crashing down onto my own. I immediately responded by wrapping my free arm around her neck and closing my eyes at the intense pleasure of her mouth moving against my own. I was in heaven, I felt my body come alive with a jolt as her tongue swept its way across my bottom lip and I happily granted her access, our tongues dueled for dominance for what seemed like hours before oxygen became a necessity and we broke apart, she pressed her forehead to my own and I kept my eyes closed.</p>
<P>"Miley? Please open your eyes?"she asked me. I gave a shaky sigh.</p>
<P>"Only if you promise that this wont all be some beautiful dream when I do and that you'll stay,"I whispered.</p>
<P>"Miley, I promise its not a dream, and I promise I'll still be right here when you open those beautiful eyes and find that I'll still love you just the same-"my eyes snapped open at that comment and I felt my jaw open. She giggled,</p>
<P>"Did you just say-?"</p>
<P>"Love?"she interrupted. "Yes, Miley I love you, I have for the longest time, and I'm sorry if I'm misreading you, but I hope I'm not and I hope that song really meant what I thought it did."</p>
<P>"It did, it <I>so</I> did, I love you Lilly,"she cried, smiling gleefully. Throwing my arms around her neck and hugging her tightly. She laughed,</p>
<P>"Well I hope so, I'd be a bit offended if that song was written for <I>another</I> Lilly,"she said jokingly and I pulled away, taking her face in my hands.</p>
<P>"Never,"I whispered and pressed my lips to hers in a tender kiss. When we broke apart she looked confused,</p>
<P>"My love is better than chocolate huh?"she joked.</p>
