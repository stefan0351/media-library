<!-- Fake Plastic Trees \ Part One -->

<p>Today had just about been the longest day ever, and of course, it was Monday, which only made the day suck that much harder.  It seemed like all the teachers got together and decided to inflict mass retribution, all giving obscene amounts homework just to prove some kind of point.  Then Glamazon practice went long because Mary Cherry could not get that herkie to save her life, and we had to do it over and over and over.  And to top it all off, there was nothing good in the refrigerator.  At least Sam wasn't around to annoy and irritate, as was her wont.</p>

		<p>But what's this?  Two letters sitting on the kitchen counter delivered registered mail, one addressed to me, and one to Sam.  The return address read from the Law Offices of Medeski, Martin and Wood.  The hell?  I slid a butter knife between the folds of the vellum envelope and withdrew a single sheet, half expecting the expensive paper to be saturated with perfume; it was too nice in quality to be used merely for business purposes.  It wasn't a love letter, however, but a strongly worded censure from the legal counsel of Enterteenment Today and Ms. Jamie Gunn, producer of said TV program.</p>

		<p>I turned when I heard the back door open, and watched Sam enter wearily, dropping her bag right in the middle of the kitchen floor where she knew I would be sure to trip over it.</p>

		<p>"Hey," she sighed, "what a day."</p>

		<p>"Tell me about it," I replied, "and it's about to get worse."</p>

		<p>Sam frowned.  "Meaning?"</p>

		<p>I picked up her envelope and tossed it to her.  "Meaning we're going to get sued by Enterteenment Today for breach of contract."</p>

		<p>Sam's eyes grew round, and her mouth opened like her doctor had asked her to say "Ahh," only without the sound effect.  It would have been funny if the charge weren't so serious.  It was an extremely rare event when Sam was at a loss for words.  She tore open the envelope and scanned the text of the letter.  "Contract?  I don't remember signing any contract, do you?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," I replied.  "In Principal Hall's office, the day we met Jamie."  The slick Hollywood producer had whipped out the contracts so fast it wasn't surprising that Sam had forgotten.  Sam glanced up at me; I could tell she remembered now.  We had both signed without a second thought, and Principal Hall had insisted on making copies for us.  I wasn't positive, but thought that mine was probably somewhere in my locker at school.  "I don't suppose you kept your copy?"</p>

		<p>"I must have," Sam said, already moving to the stairs, her head bent to the letter once again.</p>

		<p>I had to smile with satisfaction when I saw her stumble over her book bag, that was usually my job, but she kept walking, barely noticing the obstacle in her path.  I cut up an apple and slathered it with some peanut butter, then took it with me as I followed Sam upstairs.    </p>

		<p>It had been over a month ago that we finished working on the ten-minute segment for Enterteenment Today on the pitfalls of fame in the world of a popular teen, using Josh Ford as our subject, only to destroy all of our hard work and replace the segment with an apology of sorts.  We explained in a short, videotaped message that we couldn't in good conscience submit something that went against the wishes of the subject, who was a good friend of ours.  It had been one of the few times that Sam and I agreed on the proper course of action, feeling guilty for using Josh purely for selfish purposes.  Now it looked like our good intentions were coming back to bite us in the ass, because we really had erased not only the edited segment, but all of the footage Sam and Harrison had shot as well.  Prison jumpsuit orange is so not my color.  We were fucked.</p>

		<p>Sam's door was open, so I entered without knocking and sat on her bed.  She was standing over the open drawer of the filing cabinet next to her desk.  I ask you:  what teenager has a filing cabinet in which to keep all of their "important" papers?  She had this really involved filing system for her Zapruder stories and whatever the hell else she kept in there, but for once, her anal-ness had paid off, as she had found and was now poring over the contract we had signed with a look of concentration.</p>

		<p>I looked around Sam's room and was struck at how neat everything was.  Ever since she had moved in there was never a book or an article of clothing out of place, almost as if she didn't want to give up any personal information by leaving a stuffed animal on the bed or something.  Would it kill her to hang up a few posters?  She did have a few framed photographs sitting on her dresser, including the one of our newly formed family unit that I had given her for Christmas.</p>

		<p>She extended her arm towards me and snapped her fingers, holding out her hand, but didn't look up from her reading.</p>

		<p>"What?" I asked, not having a clue what she wanted.</p>

		<p>"Apple?" she asked.</p>

		<p>What a snotty brat.  But I grudgingly handed her a chunk from my plate, anyway.</p>

		<p>After another few minutes of eating and reading, she put down the contract and picked up the letter again, frowning at it like it had ruined her day, which I guess it had.  It had certainly put a damper on mine.  Then the wrinkles in her forehead became a little less pronounced, and she looked at me.</p>

		<p>"Okay," she said, picking up the contract once again, and read aloud.  "'All materials produced become the sole property of Enterteenment Today and its parent company, including any and all exposed film shot in support and development of finished segment.'  So they have us dead to rights on that one.  But," Sam then looked again at the letter and started reading.</p>

		<p>"But, what?" I asked impatiently.</p>

		<p>"But the letter is only a warning of what they are planning on doing.  I think it's a scare tactic."</p>

		<p>"Well it worked, I kind of have a little pee running down my leg," I joked.  "So what do they really want?"</p>

		<p>"I think they just want their segment," Sam directed her gaze at me.</p>

		<p>"You mean do it over?" I wailed.  "We can't do that to Josh, Sam," I shook my head.  "No. I won't do that to him."  I was surprised at her.  She was just going to cave in to the man like that?  So much for her championing the cause of the underdog and all that.</p>

		<p>"The contract doesn't specify what the subject has to be," Sam explained, sitting down next to me.  "We just have to do another segment, it doesn't matter what the story is."  She pointed to the letter.  "They're not filing the suit until the end of the month, so if we can get it done by then, we can avoid this whole mess.  I think they just want what they are legally entitled to, they don't want to take us to court any more than we want to be taken."</p>

		<p>"Oh," I said.  It made sense.  But what a pain.  I wished I had never met Jamie Gunn.  It was my own fault for being swept up in my own stupid dreams of being Holly Hunter in Broadcast News.  Or was it William Hurt?  Whatever.  "Sam, the end of the month is only ten days away, we'll never get it done in time."</p>

		<p>"We're going to have to, unless you want to become a number on a shirt pocket, smoking cigars and slinging hash in a women's prison," Sam replied pragmatically, folding the letter and getting up again, beginning to pace.  "Why don't we do the teen runaways idea I originally pitched?  Or maybe we could do something on the homeless in general," she brainstormed, head down as she wore a path in the carpet.</p>

		<p>"What is it with you and teen runaways?" I asked.  "God, Sam, if we only have ten days, we have to keep this simple."</p>

		<p>"Well, what do you suggest we do, Katie Couric?" Sam asked, exasperated.</p>

		<p>"I don't know, but not something where we're going to have to do a lot of legwork to line up a bunch of interviews, there's no time for that," I returned, reasonably.</p>

		<p>Sam stopped pacing and looked at me.  "You're right.  I have to scale down."</p>

		<p>Hello?  I'm a part of this too, dumbass.</p>

		<p>"How about something with Carmen becoming a cheerleader?  Or maybe we could profile Lily and one of her causes," Sam started pacing again.</p>

		<p>"No way, Sam," I shook my head.  "How is that any different than invading Josh's privacy?"</p>

		<p>"Arghh!  How come you always have to be right all the time?" Sam exclaimed, raising her fists to her temples, acting about as dramatically as possible.</p>

		<p>"Just trying to be the voice of reason," I said, trying to hide my amusement.</p>

		<p>I had to admit that there were moments during that project when Sam and I really clicked.  It was like we were on the same wavelength and could finish each other's thoughts or something.  I mean, yeah, she is a total pain most of the time, but it really felt good when she complimented me on my interviewing style, or asked me for my input on different shots or whatever.  Then the project was over, and not long after that, Emory Dick's trial had put us back on opposing sides. Two steps forward, two steps back.  Not that it mattered to me whether or not we got along.  I had enough friends and a life of my own to worry about without adding high-maintenance McPherson to the roster.</p>

		<p>"If we can't do something about people we don't know, and we can't do something about people we do know, where does that leave us?" Sam faced me, hands on hips.</p>

		<p>I didn't know, isn't she the one that's supposed to have all the ideas?  I was about to shrug my shoulders and leave the room, and tell her to get back to me whenever she thought of something, when an idea, fully formed, popped into my head.  "We should do the story about us."</p>

		<p>"Huh?" Sam was frowning again.</p>

		<p>"We should do a story about how second marriages and high divorce statistics and other factors impact the life of the modern teen."  I thought the idea was a good one, and ways to augment it came tumbling out of my mouth before I could censor them.  "We could do the segment in three parts:  an interview of you, an interview of me, and one with Dad and Jane."  I looked at Sam and tried to gauge her reaction, I could never tell if she was going to love something or hate it.</p>

		<p>She peered at me with those beady brown eyes for a few moments.  "A journalist shouldn't be a part of the story," she finally objected.</p>

		<p>"Sam, desperate times call for desperate measures.  It's simple, it's easy, and it's doable in ten days," I said with finality.  "Unless you want to study for the SAT's in the prison library," I added.</p>

		<p>Sam eyed me speculatively, and seemed to have become convinced.  She had a habit of staring while she was deep in thought, and at this particular moment, her eyes were boring into me as the wheels turned in that pea-brain of hers, and it was kind of disconcerting.  I tried to stare her down, but she wasn't even seeing me, so I just sat there, fidgeting with my now empty plate, waiting for her to snap out of it.</p>

		<p>"Okay," she finally said.  "I'll start doing some research about the effects of broken homes and remarriage on adolescents.  First thing tomorrow I'll book the equipment we'll need and some time in the editing room.  What are you going to do?"</p>

		<p>"The six hours of homework I was assigned?" I said, more snippily than necessary.</p>

		<p>"I have homework, too, Brooke, you have to help."  Sam crossed her arms.</p>

		<p>"All right," I relented.  "I'll start drafting questions for your interview and the one with the parentals, but how can I interview myself?"</p>

		<p>"I'll do that," Sam replied.  "But let's get one thing clear.  You can't be pulling any of your high maintenance shenanigans, okay?  We just don't have time for you to take five hours deciding what shirt you want to wear."</p>

		<p>I was so offended.  Was she actually calling me high maintenance?  When she was the one who held everybody up deciding on the exact right wording for the introduction of our original segment, like it was going to the Sundance Film Festival or something.  "Whatever, Sam.  You just do your part and I'll do mine, and we can try to get through this without killing each other."</p>

		<p>"Actually, that would make an even better story," she smirked at me.  "Salacious scandal as scrapping soon-to-be-stepsisters snuff selves in sanguinary and sordid but ultimately silly scuffle," Sam announced in her best Ripped from the Headlines voice.  "How'd you like that alliteration?"  She raised her eyebrows.</p>

		<p>What a goofball.  This was going to try my patience to the utmost, I could tell.  "Sam, do you deliberately wait until I have only one nerve left and then take malicious glee in stomping all over it?"</p>

		<p>"It's just a natural talent, I guess," Sam was still grinning, which for some reason annoyed the shit out of me.</p>

		<p>"I'm leaving before you make me have to hurt you," I said, collecting my plate, turning away from her irrepressible cheeriness.  What does she have to be so happy about?  She and I have just added about fifty hours of work to the next ten days, and she looked almost jovial at the prospect.</p>

		<p>"Fine."</p>

		<p>"Fine."  I got up and left, closing the door behind me with a force that was closer to a slam than a click.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The cursor blinked away, mocking me with its expectant blinkyness, while I sat, utterly uninspired, in front of a blank Word document.  I had already changed the font to Times New Roman, which I thought was appropriately hard hitting and news-like, hoping it would spur some kind of thought process, and I could get these interview questions done, but I had nothing.  Nada.  After getting Trig, English, French and Biology out of the way, there were very few synapses firing for the Enterteenment Today project.</p>

		<p>Now, I usually didn't spend much time thinking about Sam, my nemesis-cum-housemate, unless she had done something to piss me off, which was admittedly a frequent occurrence, and then I would only dwell on the many and varied ways I could return the favor and make her life a living hell.  But this project was forcing me to think of her in a different way, to see her not just as the bane of my existence, but objectively, as a girl who had lost the only family she had ever known and who was compelled to find a place for herself in a situation she hadn't chosen.  Taking our personal history out of the picture and looking at her as the victim of her mother's decisions made her appear very sympathetic indeed, and I didn't really like it.  It made it harder to dislike her if I was identifying with her plight.  Which, of course, I would have to, since, there we were, sitting in the same boat.  But the fact that I, too, was a casualty of my father's whims didn't really seem to factor in so much.</p>

		<p>I could admit to myself that, despite all my protestations in the beginning, having Jane and Sam around had made the house a much livelier and happier place to be.  After years of just my father and me rattling around in this big old place, which, let's face it, sometimes felt like mausoleum, I enjoyed Jane's maternal presence in the kitchen, and even, god forbid I mention it, the comforting sound of intermittent bursts of rapid fire keyboard action coming from Sam's room.  Like now, she was probably busy typing up a production schedule or getting her own interview questions done, or maybe she was just drafting her Academy Award acceptance speech for best documentary ? short subject. </p>

		<p>There was something about Sam, she had a single-minded ruthlessness for getting things accomplished, and she never procrastinated.  It was so annoying.  It was kind of ironic that I was the one who consistently got the better grades, because I seldom did more than what was required to just slide by, while Sam attacked each assignment like it was her bid for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Maybe there was something to all her bitter accusations that popularity had an effect on how teachers viewed someone.</p>

		<p>Wait.  What am I doing?  Am I actually finding validity in one of her weak, syllogistic arguments?  Only someone like Sam could make a fallacious deductive leap like "Brooke gets good grades, Brooke is popular, therefore all popular people get good grades unfairly."  I've definitely spent too much time at the computer tonight; the glare from the monitor must be affecting my brain, or something.</p>

		<p>I leaned back on the two rear legs of my desk chair and thought of the way Sam and I had interacted since we had become aware of each other's existence at the beginning of the school year.  I had only known her for about six months, which seemed incredible because it felt like she had been making my life miserable for eons.  At least our encounters had taken on the satisfying predictability of a mathematical equation.  If someone like Pythagoras was to write a theorem based on Sam's and my arguments, it would go something like this: </p>

		<p>Sam(x) + Brooke(y) / Brooke(x) + Sam(y)  = n. </p>

		<p>Where   x = bitchy remarks concerning intellect, friends, social standing
			<br>
	y =  insults about hair, face, body image, etc.
			<br>
	n =  someone leaving in tears and/or frustration
		</p>

		<p>Usually there were an equal number of x's and y's and all those disparaging comments just ended up canceling each other out.  Rarely did either of us gain an advantage in these sometimes-epic battles of the barbed tongue, it had been weeks since any tears had been shed due to creative invective or spiteful verbal abuse. </p>

		<p>Which is why, I suddenly realized, Sam was changing things around on me.  I brought all four legs of my chair back to the floor with a thump.  It was true that things had been relatively tranquil for the past little while, and I couldn't remember when it started.  It had to be the calm before the storm.  Sam was gearing up for something new and different, and it was sure to make me look like an ass.  Maybe she was trying to lull me into a false sense of security before striking in some new and dastardly way, but then maybe she was just getting tired of the repetitive nature of our arguments, as I was, and didn't want to participate anymore.  Whatever she was up to, I had to stay vigilant; it would not do to be caught unawares with an adversary as formidable as Sam.</p>

		<p>I had to be really tired if I was using Algebra to deconstruct my relationship with Sam.  I was never very good at Algebra anyway.  I shut down my computer, the interview questions would have to wait until tomorrow, anything I did now would just be crap, anyway.    </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>I looked up from my fruit salad to see Sam approaching my table, carrying her lunch tray precariously in one hand.  Dear god, she didn't think she was entitled to sit with me just because we were working on a project together, did she?  She ignored the other occupants of my table and stood before me.</p>

		<p>"Brooke, can I talk to you for a second?"</p>

		<p>"What is it, Sam?"  I replied, shortly.  Mary Cherry and Nic were looking disdainfully at Sam as if she was a piece of crud that had landed on their Miu Miu slingbacks, but she hadn't even noticed.</p>

		<p>"In private?" </p>

		<p>Sam looked pained at needing to ask for privacy, and I was intrigued.  I got up and steered her by the elbow away from the table, noticing that her posse of neo maxi zoom dweebies across the cafeteria were rapt with attention.  I guess it did warrant a mention on the nightly news if Sam was making an overture towards the enemy.</p>

		<p>When we were a sufficient distance away from the prying ears, but not eyes, of my tablemates, I turned to her, "What?"</p>

		<p>Sam put her tray down at the empty table next to us and looked at me.  "About the TV segment thing, it occurred to me last night, as I was making up some interview questions, that this is some really personal information we'll be discussing, that has a possibility, however small, of ending up on national television.  Stuff about your mom, and everything," Sam looked down, trying to hide her embarrassment.  "I just wanted to make sure you still wanted to do this."</p>

		<p>She was so sweet.  How thoughtful.  "I appreciate that, Sam, but what choice do we really have?  Besides, it's not going to be a picnic for you, either, with your father.  Are you comfortable with that?"  I knew Sam's father was a touchy subject, but nothing else.  She didn't talk about him, well, not to me, at least.</p>

		<p>"I'll be fine," Sam nodded briskly, moving to pick up her tray.  "So, I was able to get the camera and the DAT, and I thought we could get my interview over with today, after school, and then? What?"</p>

		<p>Sam had obviously seen my guilty expression.  "I didn't have time to do your questions, yet," I confessed, it sounded lame even to my own ears.</p>

		<p>Sam dropped her tray back to the table with a thud.  "God, Brooke, I only asked you to do one simple thing and you couldn't even do that.  If we can't get this done, need I remind you that it's both of us who will be receiving visitors through bullet-proof glass, not just you," she huffed.</p>

		<p>Forget what I said, she's not sweet.  She's a sanctimonious pain in the keister.  "Well, excuse me if I needed a few hours of sleep last night, and can't fuel myself with smug self-righteousness like some people I know," I glared at her.  "What's the big deal?  If your questions are done, you can do me today, and I'll do you tomorrow."  Wait, that didn't sound right.</p>

		<p>"Whatever," Sam muttered, obviously swallowing the retort that had been on the tip of her tongue.  "Okay, but we'll have to do it right after school, I have an editorial meeting at four."</p>

		<p>"I can't," I told her, "I have practice right after school."  Like I do every day, Sam, duh.</p>

		<p>"Can't you miss it just this once, Brooke?  It's not like civilization as we know it will begin to crumble if you can't practice a basket toss for one day," she snarked.</p>

		<p>"Why can't you miss your meeting?  I know cheerleading can't compare to getting your lousy little rag out to all ten enquiring minds that want to know," I replied, equally sarcastically,  "but I'm sure they can carry on without their fearless leader for one day."</p>

		<p>"I can't miss my meeting."  Sam's nostrils flared in anger, but she didn't say anything else.</p>

		<p>"Well I can't miss practice," I folded my arms across my chest.  We were at an impasse.</p>

		<p>"Whatever," Sam said, again.</p>

		<p>"Whatever," I mimicked, childishly.</p>

		<p>"Okay, I get it," Sam bit out.</p>

		<p>"Good," I returned, petulantly.  God, why were we such babies?</p>

		<p>"Then I guess we're not doing this today," Sam sighed, resignedly.  "I'll cancel the gear."  She turned to go back to her side of the cafeteria.</p>

		<p>"Wait, can't we do it at, like, five, or something?"  For some strange reason, I suddenly hated the thought of Sam disappointed in me.  "And I have a free period this afternoon, I could work on the questions then, if you want."  It was the closest I could come to an apology.</p>

		<p>I could see the wheels start turning again.  "Five isn't too late if we do it outside, we could use the natural light," Sam said, half to herself.  "Why don't I meet you out on the field when I'm done, we can do it on the bleachers." </p>

		<p>Again, something didn't sound quite right about that last statement.</p>

		<p>"You can keep your practice uniform on," she continued, getting excited, "it'll be great for the interview, like characterization shorthand.  Even the most popular cheerleader isn't immune from the effects of divorce."  Sam said it like she was reciting a voiceover for the segment.</p>

		<p>"But I'll be all hot and sweaty," I objected.  If there was even the remotest possibility of this being on TV, I was not going to be perspiring when it happened.</p>

		<p>"Hot and sweaty is a good look for you," Sam dismissed, casually.</p>

		<p>"What?" I gaped at Sam, just what in the hell did she mean by that?</p>

		<p>"I'm kidding, Brooke," Sam deadpanned, "Sheesh, can't you take a joke?"  She picked up her now ice cold hot lunch.  "Do whatever you want, see you later," she turned and walked away, leaving me to stare at her retreating back as she did so.</p>
