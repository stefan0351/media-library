<!-- About a Girl \ Part 21 -->

<p>"So what was with the receiver off the hook last night, Singer?" Tad  asked nudging Katie lecherously as he grinned over at her.  He'd been  fairly pissed off at her for a couple of days, and then unimpressed  with her for a couple more days, but after she'd come over to his  house giving him the puppy dog eyes, things had pretty much gone back  to normal.  In fact as he asked this, she was dismounting from his  back after the piggyback ride he'd just given her through the  hallways.  He figured that he had no chance with Jessie so he could  as well live vicariously through his friend.</p>

<p>"Shut up Tad," Katie responded slapping him on the shoulder, though  she was smiling widely.</p>

<p>"Sup?" Russell asked coming up behind them wrapping his arm around  Katie's neck playfully.  Katie yanked off his hat and pulled it over  her head, nodding at him with a slight pout on her lips, completely  thugged out.</p>

<p>"Katie's phone was off the hook last night, while Jessie was over and  her parents were out," Tad responded grinning, smiling even brighter  at the look of pure venom Katie shot him as Russell `oooooh'ed in her  ear, using the opportunity to also steal his hat back.</p>

<p>"Hey," they heard from the side, all three of them turning to see  Sarah Grasser standing beside them.</p>

<p>"What'd you want?" Tad asked contemptuously, standing up to his full  height.  He'd never liked Sarah much; she always acted like something  had crawled up to ass to everyone but Katie.  It had pissed him off,  how she'd been able to dupe his friend for so long.  Even now, Katie  still isn't insisted that she wasn't always a complete bitch, but Tad  knew better.  Sarah was just letting Katie see it now too.  </p>

<p>"Can I talk to you for a minute?" Sarah asked ignoring Tad and  looking straight at Katie.</p>

<p>"I don't know that we have anything to talk about," Katie replied as  Russell and Tad glared at Sarah for her, allowing her to remain  looking nonchalant.</p>

<p>"Please," Sarah said ignoring Katie's entourage.  "Just for a  minute," she continued her voice slightly pleading.</p>

<p>"Fine," Katie said not really wanting to see her grovel in the middle  of the hallway.  "Over here," she said nodding to a quieter place  down the hall.</p>

<p>"Desperate's her colour don't you think?" Russell asked as they  watched to two girls make their way down the hall.</p>

<p>"Nah, I'd go with black, to match her soul," Tad replied smiling.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Hey Sammler, you have GOT to call me," Brian Jones called out as  Jessie and Grace made their way through the halls.</p>

<p>"Cool, I'll pencil you in right after pigs fly," Jessie called back  winking at him before pushing on.</p>

<p>"Nice," Grace commented, thinking that was a smoothly delivered  comeback.  She would have to give that one a grade of at least 9.7.</p>

<p>"You know what they say about practice," Jessie responded absently,  shaking her head.  They could at least try and come up with some  original material.</p>

<p>"How often do you get that?" Grace asked thinking that while Jessie  had always been able to hold her own in verbal sparring match, one- line zingers had never been her specialty.</p>

<p>"Oh, just about a million times everyday," Jessie, muttered rolling  her eyes.   "Hmmm, soon you'll be able to insult in a single bound," Grace  commented, pleased to see Jessie smirk at the comment, but a little  disoriented when she saw her stepsister's face cloud over a second  later.  Turning her head to follow Jessie's Grace saw Katie and Sarah  Grasser standing off in a quiet corner just down the hallway.</p>

<p>Jessie took a step forwards as if she were going to head over but  then stopped.  It was ridiculous, she had a class to get to, and  Katie could talk to whomever she wanted.  She wasn't going to be one  of those jealous girlfriends who like video taped every move their  significant other made.  It was stupid.</p>

<p>"You're not going over there?" Grace asked having seen Jessie's move  forward and then her abrupt stop.</p>

<p>"No," Jessie replied even though she really wanted to.</p>

<p>"Why?  You obviously want to," Grace asked.</p>

<p>"Because I'm not going to give Sarah the satisfaction of knowing that  she actually makes me jealous, so she can just take her conniving and  suck on it REAL hard," Jessie muttered before turning down the  hallway that led to her class leaving Grace alone to observe the  scene.  Grace shook her head in sympathy for the bitch fest that  Katie was bound to be gobsmacked with later for her egregious break  in dating etiquette then headed for her own class.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Katie asked boredly leaning against a nearby locker as  Sarah stopped in front of her looking down at her shoes doing her  best humility impression.</p>

<p>"Do you have to be so hostile?" Sarah asked quietly looking up at  Katie as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Just following your lead," Katie replied not looking at Sarah,  knowing that if she did she'd feel bad for snapping at the girl even  though she deserved it and not wanting that to happen.  She'd tried,  when she'd realized that she'd hurt Sarah, she'd tried to talk to  her, tried to make her realize that they could still be friends even  if everything else had to end, but Sarah hadn't wanted to hear it,  hadn't been able to hear.  She'd made Katie choose and then she'd  gotten mad and bitchy when Katie chose Jessie.  It was Sarah's  problem to deal with now, not hers.  She'd tried.</p>

<p>"I deserve that," Sarah said with a sigh, glancing over at Katie.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you really do," Katie, replied, her stance loosening  nonetheless now that she was fairly confident that they were about to  have a civil conversation instead of the usual spitting contest.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you know," Sarah said seeing Katie relax slightly.  "About  how I acted after … about how I acted.  I was just hurt, and I know  you didn't mean to," she added quickly seeing Katie tense in  preparation to respond.  "Really I do.  It's just you know, sometimes  teenage plus girl equals unimaginable bitch," she continued adding to  herself that when you added love to the equation the bitch just got  bigger.  "I should've been happy for you, and I am.  Now," she pushed  on seeing Katie watching her with interest.  "And you said, before  that we could still we friends, and you know, if that offers still on  the table I'd like to accept it this time.  I miss you."</p>

<p>Katie looked at Sarah intensely for a moment before sighing and  letting her gaze drift around the crowded hallway.  After things had  gone bad between them, she'd been filled with so much guilt, and  she'd wished for so long that the day would come when Sarah would  realize that she hadn't meant any harm and they could just go back to  the way things had been before.  But that had been a wish she'd long  since given up on, and now that she had heard the words she'd longed  to hear for so long, she just felt sad, hollow.  She realized she  didn't really care anymore, that while Sarah may have missed her she  didn't miss Sarah all that much.  But, she also remembered when  things had been good between them, fun.  Sarah had never touched her  deep down inside like Jessie did, she never felt Sarah's presence  with her even when she wasn't around like she did Jessie, and they  didn't have that age old friendship that tied them together tighter  than either of them realized like she did with Tad.  Sarah was just  fun, but fun had been really good.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Katie said quietly her gaze drifting back to  Sarah.  "It's not that I don't want to be friends, it's just that  with everything that's happened it'd be really complicated."</p>

<p>"And by complicated you mean Jessie doesn't like me and if we start  hanging out again she won't let you in the ballpark let alone near  any of her bases," Sarah replied darkly, having sensed Katie on the  edge of giving her a chance.</p>

<p>"So we're back to this are we?" Katie asked tiredly looking over at  Sarah sadly.  "I'd like to accept your offer, really I would.  But I  don't believe you, and you're not helping yourself with shit like  that.  Jessie's my girlfriend, and I'm not going to risk hurting her  by hanging out with you if all you're gonna do is insult our  relationship and piss and moan about how life done you wrong," Katie  continued beginning to pick up speed.  "Sometimes things don't work  out the way we want them to.  Deal with it.  You're not special.   You're problems aren't any more of a tragedy than anyone else's," she  went on pushing off the locker.  "So yeah, we can be friends again …  when you stop taking behavioral tips from you're three year old  sister," she finished starting down the hallway.</p>

<p>"Wait," Sarah said reaching out for her and grasping her around the  arm stopping her from moving.  "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you keep saying that, and yet…" Katie replied removing Sarah's  hand from her arm.</p>

<p>"Please, just give me a chance," Sarah continued moving to stand in  front of Katie looking up at her through her eyelashes as innocent as  could be.  "I promise, no more digs.  Let's just hang out, and if  it's cool then it's cool, and if you find my company unbearable than  I swear I won't bug you again."</p>

<p>Katie looked over at Sarah's pleading face, and sad hopeful eyes and  sighed.  The offer sounded reasonable, and it couldn't really hurt  anything.  "Fine.  What'd you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"How about a study session?" Sarah suggested trying to remain calm.   She hadn't expected Katie to give in so easily, but she was delighted  that she had.  Maybe Katie missed her to and was just too proud to  admit it.  "You help me with math, I'll help you with geography and  we can top off by making fun of Mauray Povich."</p>

<p>"Alright," Katie said brightening at the suggestion of Mauray  Povich.  Jessie refused to watch it with her, even though she  insisted they would only watch to mock him endlessly.  She had so  much daytime TV hate bottled up and would now be able to release it  constructively.</p>

<p>"Great.  How about after school then?" Sarah asked.  "I mean unless  you already have plans," she continued uncertainly images of Jessie  floating around her mind mocking her.</p>

<p>"After school's fine," Katie responded.  Jessie had a doctor's  appointment and was going out to dinner with her mom afterwards so  they hadn't made any plans.  "I'll drop by your locker.  We can do it  at my house, mom's likely to be upstairs grouting something so we  won't have to worry about her."</p>

<p>"Cool, see you then," Sarah said backing up and turning around not  wanting to stick around and give Katie a chance to change her mind.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, later," Katie replied absently as Sarah headed off down the  hallway, sighing once the girl was out of sight.  She suddenly felt  like someone had just strapped a medium sized planet to her back.   Intellectually, she couldn't see what was wrong with trying to get  along with Sarah again; lord knew her life was easier when the other  girl didn't actively hate her.  Yet, despite this line of reasoning,  she couldn't help but feel she'd just made a serious mistake.   Sighing again she shook her head, there was nothing she could do  about it now; she'd given Sarah her word, and it was only one night. </p>
