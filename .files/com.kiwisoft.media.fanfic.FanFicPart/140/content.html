<!-- The Prom \ Story -->

<p>In a church, in front of the altar, the two girls stood. Both in matching silk, white,
dresses with shoulder straps, and hair up. They each held a bouquet, smiling, even though
all the pews were empty. Faith and Buffy were the only ones in the church, besides the
minister, but they didn't care. It was the best day of their lives, and they were radiant.</p>

<p>The priest had been reading from his book, and as he looked up to get the vows, his
expression turned from one of happiness, to one of disgust. He threw his book to the floor
in anger. The two fiancées backed up, Faith dropped her ring out of fear, and Buffy's ring
just fell out of her hand. The objects' impact seemed to resonate through the building.</p>

<p>"How dare you disgrace the House of the Lord!" The man yelled. "Be gone with you!
Demons!"</p>

<p>The stained-glass windows on the walls began to implode, their shards flying into the
church. They ran toward the exit, ducking and shielding their faces with their arms.
Linked hands were the only things keeping them together, and then a shard flew right into
their fingers, causing them to separate.</p>

<p>As everything went white around her, Faith couldn't find her partner. But she did see
everyone that was ever in her life, appearing in the pews. Her parents, Joyce, Giles, the
rest of the gang, and the last thing she saw, were their glaring eyes. Their hatred. Their
judgement. Everything that was negative was in their eyes.</p>

<p>Then she woke up.</p>

<p>Her eyes shot open, and she sat upright in bed, sweating. Trying to calm her breathing,
she looked out the bedroom window, to see that it was still dark outside. Where did that
dream come from? She had no idea. It had never happened before. She couldn't really
contemplate it for too long though, because Buffy was lying in bed as well, and was
pulling on her tank top.</p>

<p>They had made sure to put clothes on after their lovemaking sessions, just in case Joyce
walked in at some point.</p>

<p>"Back down please." Buffy mumbled into her pillow. Faith had to smile, and she quickly
complied with the half-awake blonde's wishes. Buffy readjusted her body so they were
touching, draped her arm over the brunette, and kissed her cheek. "Better."</p>

<p> The younger slayer laid there, just listening to the other one breathe, and the dream was
quickly fading out of her mind.</p>

<p>"I love you, B."</p>

<p>"Love you too." Buffy said. "Even more than...sleep."</p>

<p>While her girlfriend re-entered dreamland, Faith stayed awake, looking at the older
slayer's face as she slept.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>When the sun's rays shined in the window a few hours later, Faith was still watching. She
hadn't gone back to sleep. She didn't want to have that dream again, and she found herself
thinking of its possible meanings. She had tried hard to forget it, but it just stayed
with her. The fact that Buffy didn't have it, made her think that it wasn't a prophetic
foretelling of anything.</p>

<p>It had come from her mind, and she was sure of that, because her parents had been in it.
Was her subconscious trying to tell her something? Was she afraid? She couldn't quite
pinpoint it. It wasn't a question of whether or not she was content, because she most
certainly was. Then something popped into her mind. Something the Mayor had said a few
days ago.</p>

<p>(Aren't you quite the pair? Can't you just feel the love? Not caring what anybody thinks
of you...strong-willed is what you two are.)</p>

<p>Did she care? Maybe...but when did people's opinions on her and Buffy's relationship
matter to her? Or...</p>

<p>"Mm... morning." Buffy yawned, interrupting her train of thought.</p>

<p>"Hey." Faith said with a smile.</p>

<p>When the blonde opened her eyes all the way, she studied the brunette.</p>

<p>"How long have you been up?"</p>

<p>"Woke up a few minutes ago."</p>

<p>"You lie."</p>

<p>She was caught. "Few hours."</p>

<p>Buffy raised her eyebrows. "Doing what?"</p>

<p>Faith had several answers to the question, most of them dirty, but she decided to be
truthful. Mostly, anyway.</p>

<p>"Just reminding myself how beautiful you are, and how lucky I got."</p>

<p>She watched Buffy's whole face light up. It started with her eyes, and continued downward,
to where her lips curved into a wide, thousand-watt smile. Neither of them said anything
for awhile. Buffy was speechless, and Faith saw a tear rolling down her cheek.</p>

<p>"You are the best thing that's ever happened to me." It was said with so much emotion,
that because of the early hour, Faith's brain went into overload. "Whatever made you come
up to me that first day...thank you."</p>

<p>"Thanks for talkin' with me."</p>

<p>"Like I could've ignored you." The smile stayed on her face as she played with the brown
strands of Faith's hair in between her fingers. "I was gonna torture you, but I can't
anymore."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"Would you go to the prom with me, Faith?"</p>

<p>Faith realized she had been expecting that, and felt an unexpected rush of...what was it?
Anxiety? She suppressed it, because she had known what her answer was for months now.</p>

<p>"You have to ask?"</p>

<p>"I'm being formal. I have to do it this way. It's a rule."</p>

<p>"Then yeah, of course I will."</p>

<p>"Goodie." They kissed for several seconds, until Buffy remembered she had school. She
waited for the disappointment of breaking contact to pass, and got out of her bed. "You
coming?"</p>

<p>"Actually, I think I'm gonna stick around here today."</p>

<p>"Oh. Is everything okay?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Fine. Don't wanna get up, that's all."</p>

<p>"Feeling lazy?"</p>

<p>"Yep, I'm a bum."</p>

<p>"My bum." Buffy grinned, getting clothes out of her dresser.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't have it any other way."</p>

<p>"I'm gonna be late!" She rushed and got dressed. "I'll have to shower after gym class.
Ugh."</p>

<p>"No peeking in the locker room."</p>

<p>"They don't do anything for me."</p>

<p>"They better not." Faith said seriously, and then smiled. "Have a good day, B."</p>

<p>"You too, honey."</p>

<p>She was still adjusting to the name. Buffy really did like saying it. It made the brunette
feel like she was a part of something permanent. Part of her loved that feeling, and
another part of her, was scared. And she thought she was starting to understand why.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>When she finally got out of the bed, she decided to go downstairs and get a glass of
orange juice. She needed fluids, or she'd be sluggish all day. On her way to the kitchen,
she passed by Joyce, who was dusting the corners of the ceiling in the living room. She
wasn't expecting to see her, thinking Joyce had gone to work.</p>

<p>"Took off too, huh?" Joyce asked her. "When I realized how dirty the house was, and that
it wasn't getting cleaner, I figured I had to close the gallery for a day and stay home."</p>

<p>"Uh...sorry." Faith said quietly.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. Buffy has never remembered to do any of her chores. I'm used to
it."</p>

<p>"I'm gonna get juice. You want some? It'll make me feel less guilty."</p>

<p>"Sounds good."</p>

<p>Joyce lowered the long duster, and propped it up against the couch. She followed the
slayer into the kitchen, and got two glasses out of the cabinet as Faith got the carton
from the fridge. Watching Faith pour, her maternal instinct alarms went off. She got
handed her glass, and taking a sip, she decided to find out what was up.</p>

<p>"Something wrong?"</p>

<p>"No. " Faith avoided. "Why would you think that?"</p>

<p>"Just wondering." They both stood over the counter, drinking. "Hey, it's a nice morning.
What do you say we go sit out on the porch?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy, Cordelia, and Willow sat around the library table, engrossed in girl talk. Wesley
and Giles were trying to block out their voices, frantically researching the Ascension.
The cheerleader was finally getting to the best part. Her news.</p>

<p>"You? And him?" Buffy asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Hmm mm." She said with a dreamy smile.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Cordy."</p>

<p>"Yeah, congratulations." Willow pouted. "I'm the only one...the only one!"</p>

<p>"The only one what?" Giles asked from the stacks.</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Will." Buffy smirked. "Just be patient."</p>

<p>"Patient? I'm very patient. Now I'm going...crazy. I'm ready, darn it."</p>

<p>"Poor Willow." Cordelia said sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"Anyway, I don't know if I can leave now. You know?" The two other girls nodded. "And he
wants to take a road trip. With me. Plus, I still don't have enough money for a dress. Too
many things happening at one time. I can't take it."</p>

<p>"This may not be the best time to bring this up..." The slayer trailed off, and hesitated.
"But I'm gonna see if Faith wants to go to the store and pick out dresses after school.
Think you could help us?"</p>

<p>"No problem. We can talk about the prom. I'm okay."</p>

<p>"You sure?" Willow asked gently.</p>

<p>"Go ahead. Really."</p>

<p>"It's just...I saw this one dress that looked nice."</p>

<p>"That blue and sorta short one?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Not too short, medium. And it had this weird, sorta fringey stuff on its arms."</p>

<p>"What's that, a demon?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"A prom dress that Will was thinking of getting. Can't you ever get your mind out of the
Hellmouth?" The blonde questioned him.</p>

<p>"I'd be delighted to. However, the day of the Mayor's Ascension is fast approaching and we
don't know what to expect."</p>

<p>Xander came in then, hearing the librarian's concerns, and giving his girlfriend an
"hello" kiss.</p>

<p>"Well, what about the pages that Will stole from the Mayor's book? Look, she put her life
on the line there, pal. Don't tell me they're useless." He said.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, no, we, uh, we know the Ascension refers to a human transforming into a
demon, the living embodiment of an immortal. And Graduation Day, our Mayor Wilkins is
scheduled to do just that."</p>

<p>"Trouble is, we don't know which demon he is going to become." Wesley piped in.</p>

<p>"There are thousands of species."</p>

<p>"So, it's safe to say we shouldn't waste any time of such trifling matters as a school
dance."</p>

<p>"If you want to get back on my good side, Wes, this isn't the way to do it." Buffy told
him with narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>"I know how much this means to you, Buffy," Giles said, "but he does have a point."</p>

<p>"Giles, we get it. Miles to go before we sleep. But especially if we're all gonna vaporize
or something on Graduation Day, we deserve a little prommy fun. One night of glory, not
too much to ask."</p>

<p>"I suppose...I suppose you're right." He smiled.</p>

<p>"You give into her just like that?" Wesley asked.</p>

<p>"She's made up her mind. I can't change it. Let her have the night."</p>

<p>Buffy stuck her tongue out in the direction of her official watcher, loving the feel of
victory.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Joyce and Faith sat on the porch bench, drinking their orange juices. She knew the older
woman was waiting for her to spill, and she was getting to the point where she wanted to
do just that. Sitting outside, where the only thing she could hear was the sound of the
wind chimes that were hanging off the front of the house, she felt really peaceful. And
things continued to make more and more sense. She needed to talk about it.</p>

<p>"I had a...dream...last night. It was our...uh, wedding." Joyce didn't show any reaction.
"The priest basically told us to get the hell out, we got separated, and everyone I've
ever known just sat there. Glaring at me."</p>

<p>"Was I there?"</p>

<p>Faith nodded. "How come you didn't make a big deal of it? Of us?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you? Isn't having feelings for a girl awkward?"</p>

<p>"I never really thought about it. She's Buffy." The slayer shrugged.</p>

<p>Joyce smiled. "Do you remember Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Buffy's aunt. I slept over there while you guys were in Massachusetts. Yeah, I remember
her. She was cool."</p>

<p>"And gay."</p>

<p>"She is?" Faith was surprised. It wasn't like she would have been able to tell back then,
but...</p>

<p>"My mother and father threw her out of the house when they found out. She was fifteen."</p>

<p>"Man...that musta hurt."</p>

<p>"It did. I always tried to fight for her, but I was scared of what they would do to me. I
didn't tell Hank that she was, because I knew he would never go, afraid that she would
influence Buffy. But I didn't care. She's my sister. We grew up together. I love her.</p>

<p>"When you came to the house, she automatically saw something between you two girls. Right
then, I swore that if something happened, or if Buffy decided she liked any girl beyond
being friends, that I wouldn't stand in the way. I wouldn't be like my parents. It really
tore the family apart, and ours is already torn up enough."</p>

<p>"Wow."</p>

<p>"So what do you think the dream meant?"</p>

<p>"I guess...I do kinda care what people think now. A few months ago I didn't, cause we were
just startin' out. Usually I don't get real involved with people, and it never lasts long
enough for me to give a damn about anything. But now, we're...making a commitment. We're
serious. Not marriage yet, hell, that's not even legal, but you know what I mean. Guess my
mind just decided to go for the ultimate commitment, or whatever.</p>

<p>"And with the prom in a couple days, that's a big deal too. The Prom. Everyone's gonna be
there, and some of those people are gonna have lives together. That's what it feels like
Buffy and I are gonna do. I just...feel it, and I want people to be cool with us. Be happy
for us, cause...cause I am."</p>

<p>'I want my parents, the losers that they are, to approve, too. But that isn't gonna
happen.'</p>

<p>"It scares me that they won't. If we're gonna go the distance...we're already black sheep
cause of the slaying thing, and..."</p>

<p>"I get it, Faith. Trust me, I do." Joyce said. "I can't speak for anyone else, but I
approve. And I think you know that everyone, who's really important in both your lives
now, approves too. Some people won't. Probably a good number of them. And I'm not
necessarily talking about the prom."</p>

<p>"I know." She sighed.</p>

<p>"The fact that you love my daughter enough to want everybody to know it and accept it,
well, I think that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard. People can surprise you
sometimes, but the ones that don't, the ones who can't wrap their minds around the fact
that you're together, forget them. If they can't get to know what great people you are,
they aren't worth knowing."</p>

<p>"Wicked wise, Mrs. S."</p>

<p>"You could start calling me 'Mom' now."</p>

<p>Huh. "Mom". Faith liked the sound of that. A lot.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy went to the mansion right after school. She saw Angel doing the only thing she ever
saw him do at "home" anymore. Reading old books over and over again. She walked over to
the couch, and swung her handbag in front of her, waiting for him to look up. She noticed
the title of the novel while she waited, though.</p>

<p>"Great Expectations. So does that mean that the guy who wrote it had...uh...great
expectations for it?"</p>

<p>Angel acknowledged her with a smirk. "Never read it?"</p>

<p>"Not in the sense of looking at words, no. But I saw parts of the movie." She said lamely.
"Giles said he talked to you last night, and that you wanted to tell me something."</p>

<p>He nodded, putting the book down. "The Prom's in a couple days, right?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh. I'm gonna drag Faith dress hunting. It should be fun."</p>

<p>"Good, that's...good. Enjoy yourself."</p>

<p>"I intend to." Her forehead creased. She could still read him. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"I've decided, after the Ascension, if we survive, I'm gonna leave."</p>

<p>"What?" That wasn't what she was expecting. "Why? If this is because the Mayor...Angel, I
know I hurt you, and I never meant to, really -"</p>

<p>"It's not because of you. I was asked to help you, to watch out for you. Now you have
Giles, Willow, Xander...and Faith. You have things in control here. I've known since
Christmas that I have to start making amends. There are lots of places where people don't
have anyone to protect them from..."</p>

<p>"Demons." Buffy understood.</p>

<p>"I can really make a difference, and it's about time I did."</p>

<p>She was quiet for several minutes.</p>

<p>"Will I ever hear from you again?"</p>

<p>"I'll let you know where I end up." He smiled. "You're moving forward with your life, and
I have to move forward with mine. It's not ending anytime soon."</p>

<p>"Angel...I want you know, that I don't regret a second we had together. I need you to know
that. I loved you, and even though we're not..."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>Tears were rolling down her face, and she gave him a hug.</p>

<p>"I'll miss you. You helped us so much. Not just with slaying, either. You supported us,
and you pushed Faith in the right direction. She never said it, but I know you did. Thank
you. And thanks for showing me what love is." She laughed. "Wow, was that corny or what?"</p>

<p>"Go get ready for the Prom. I'm not going anywhere yet."</p>

<p>She smiled. "I'm gone."</p>

<p>The slayer turned around, and began to leave.</p>

<p>"Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"You've both got long lives ahead."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"What I mean is -"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>When Buffy walked in her front door, her heart stopped at the sight before her. Her mother
and Faith were sitting on the couch, a tissue box was on the coffee table, and they were
watching a movie. Oh no. Their eyes were red and puffy. She walked in further, and looked
at the TV screen. Not only did it appear as if bonding had occurred, but it had occurred
watching Terms of Endearment.</p>

<p>"Tell me those tissues are because you have a cold, Faith." She looked deeply concerned.
"Please."</p>

<p>"It's really a good movie, B." The brunette sniffed.</p>

<p>"Oh God. What did you do to her?" The blonde asked her mother, horrified. "You didn't
watch...soap operas, right? Right?" She brought her hands together in a prayer gesture.</p>

<p>"No, dear." Joyce said. "There was a marathon of all of Meg Ryan's romantic movies. We
watched that instead."</p>

<p>"I'm not hearing this." She put her hands over her ears, and then went to reach for her
girlfriend's hand. Grabbing it, she started pulling her outside the door. "Come on, honey.
I'll make it better. We'll go get you something really slutty to wear to the prom."</p>

<p>"Um...k." Faith agreed.</p>

<p>"And," Buffy pointed to Joyce, "remind me to have a talk with you later. Who knows how
much damage you've done? Deprogramming isn't cheap, you know."  She went to shut the door,
and then poked her head back in. "Oh, can we have chicken for dinner? Love you, mom."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>When the slayers got inside April Fools, Cordelia rushed to them, and practically tackled
them, in a giddy haze.</p>

<p>"Yo, C. Forget to take your Ridalin?"</p>

<p>"Huh? No. Guess what?" The cheerleader was excited. "Somebody paid for the dress I
wanted!"</p>

<p>"Who?" Buffy asked, shocked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but god, I feel...yes!" The manager was eyeing her. "What can I help you
with?" She said in her best salesperson voice.</p>

<p>"Hey guys!" Willow called, already surrounded by racks of dresses. "I found some I think
you'll like."</p>

<p>"I always did have a hard time getting those things on." Faith said, slowly beginning to
grin.</p>

<p>"Then I'll just have to assist you." Buffy grinned as well, walking over to the redhead.
"Whew! Maybe she didn't destroy you too badly after all."</p>

<p>"You just have to stick with it. When she got cancer, I was -"</p>

<p>"Oh darn. I've gone deaf. Just like that."</p>

<p>"Funny how that can happen." Faith smirked. "All right, let's get this done."</p>

<p>Three hours later, they were in line to purchase. And one of the slayers was grumpy.</p>

<p>"Why? Why do you have to try on one hundred different ones, and then go back and get the
first one you had? And I could've sworn you hated it three hours ago."</p>

<p>"Are you saying you don't like it?" The blonde asked.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not -"</p>

<p>"Cause if you don't like it I can get another one."</p>

<p>"It's fine."</p>

<p>"You're just saying that. You hate it."</p>

<p>Faith sighed. "It looks great on you."</p>

<p>"I dunno...I mean, it does kinda make me look fat."</p>

<p>"No it doesn't."</p>

<p>"That red one wasn't so tight around my waist, maybe I should -"</p>

<p>"No! Just pay! For the love of God, just pay." Buffy pouted. "Don't do that. It's not
fair."</p>

<p>Cordelia and Willow had been standing back, listening to them.</p>

<p>"If they had rings on their fingers I would swear that they were..." The cheerleader
trailed off, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"So it's not just me?"</p>

<p>"Heck no."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander entered the library to see Oz and Giles sitting at the table playing poker.</p>

<p>"For God's sake man, put the books down. We've done all we can tonight." Giles said to
Wesley, who was still somewhere in the stacks.</p>

<p>"I just want to double-check..." The watcher trailed off, getting lost in his research.</p>

<p>The guitarist looked at Xander. "She get it?"</p>

<p>"She got it." He smiled.</p>

<p>"That was a very nice thing you did for her." Giles commented.</p>

<p>"Seeing her face, it was worth dipping into the road trip fund." He pulled up a chair.
"Deal me in."</p>

<p>"Five card draw. Two's are wild." Oz shuffled, and they restarted. "They still choosing?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Women are crazy creatures man."</p>

<p>"But ya gotta love 'em."</p>

<p>"Here, here. So you can get the tuxes cheap, right?"</p>

<p>"I know a guy."</p>

<p>"Why can't they be like us? Pick the first one they see, and then boom! Done."</p>

<p>"I remember this one young lady I dated at Oxford." The librarian said, taking a card.</p>

<p>"Dated or slept with?" Xander smirked.</p>

<p>"Not all my younger days revolved around my rebellious streak." He cleared his throat.
"Every night she would take me to this one tiny shop, because she liked a particular dress
they had. She could easily afford it, but never bought it. Eventually, I got so tired of
taking the trip, that I purchased it for her. Basically, she got very insulted, and I
never heard from her again."</p>

<p>"Confusing, I tell ya! Confusing!" The younger man exclaimed. "At least Buffy and Faith
are easy to get, ya know? They're straight up."</p>

<p>"Was that an intended pun?" Oz questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Giles coughed, and they swore they heard a couple books fall up by where Wesley was.</p>

<p>"Just making sure."</p>

<p>"Cordy has no idea what she wants to do after graduation."</p>

<p>"You didn't help anything by sleeping with her. Now she's more confused." Oz said.
"That's why I'm waiting with Will. Timing is everything. Raise five."</p>

<p>"I want her to stay, though. I know it meant something to her. It meant something to me."</p>

<p>"You can't force her, Xander." Giles said. "Call."</p>

<p>"Yeah..." He sighed. "I fold."</p>

<p>"Conservative player. No shame in that." Oz said. "Raise another five."</p>

<p>He put another nickel on the table.</p>

<p>"I call your five, and raise you ten." He put a nickel and a dime down. "Let's see your
cards." Giles said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Two pair."</p>

<p>"Three of a kind."</p>

<p>"Well played, Giles. Well played."</p>

<p>"That reminds me. We have to get tuxedoes as well, Wesley."</p>

<p>"What for?" Wesley asked.</p>

<p>"Why, we're chaperoning the prom, of course."</p>

<p>"We're what?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Faith paced in the foyer, waiting for Buffy to come downstairs so they could go. She was
already dressed and set. She had bought a white silk dress, with shoulder straps, that
went down to her shoes. It was exactly like the one in her dream, and as soon as she saw
it, she knew she was supposed to get it. Her dream had turned out badly, she remembered,
but she was wearing it to prove to herself that she wasn't afraid of the dream anymore.</p>

<p>If anybody was going to do or say something, she'd have no control over it, so she'd just
deal and have a good time. She would walk in the gym arm in arm with Buffy, and people
could see for themselves whatever they wanted to see. It was an important night, and she
wasn't going to ruin it by worrying, because it wouldn't be worth it. Joyce stood in
between the foyer and the living room, leaning up against the wall, silently giving her
the extra push, and then the woman looked up at her daughter.</p>

<p>Buffy came downstairs wearing a long-flowing dark pink dress, strapless, with no back. She
smiled at her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"How do I look?"</p>

<p>"Stunning." Joyce answered for the brunette, as Faith's mouth had been moving, but no
words were coming out.</p>

<p>The younger slayer nodded readily, agreeing with Joyce's assessment.</p>

<p>"At the risk of sounding like my mother, you look pretty stunning too, Faith."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Faith finally spoke, her eyes continually roaming the blonde's body.
"Okay, remember the rules. No Hokey Pokey, no Funky Chicken, and somebody's gotta spike
the punch to get me to do the Electric Slide."</p>

<p>"No dancing." Buffy smirked. "Check."</p>

<p>"You two look adorable." Joyce said in that gushing, motherly way. "Hang on, let me get
the camera."</p>

<p>She disappeared into the dining room.</p>

<p>"Adorable?" Faith frowned. "I was goin' for hot."</p>

<p>"I'd have a major mental breakdown if my mom said you were hot, but trust me, you do."</p>

<p>"Ditto, B."</p>

<p>"Mom, hurry! The gang's already there!"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay." Joyce re-entered, and aimed her camera. "Stand close together...come on, I
know you get closer than that."</p>

<p>"Mom!" Her daughter exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Big smiles..."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Stepping through the balloon archway in the gym, she and Buffy halted for a moment. In
that space of time, Faith was bracing herself for anything. But nothing happened. Everyone
was doing their own thing, and the only real acknowledgement they got was a couple glances
because they were new arrivals. There was no ridicule forthcoming, and she allowed herself
to relax.</p>

<p>Willow and Oz had noticed them, and made their way over. The redhead took turns hugging
the two of them. She had her hair up; a necklace, and a shoulder-strapped, dark red,
sparkling dress with a matching shawl.</p>

<p>"You both look awesome."</p>

<p>"So do you." Buffy said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Everything cool?" Oz asked.</p>

<p>"Five by five." Faith said. "How is this thing?"</p>

<p>"Strangely affecting. I got all teared up when they played 'We Are Family'."</p>

<p>"Everything's perfect." Willow said with a big smile.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the flashing lights hitting the dance floor, and watched the couples going
all out. Then she turned to Faith.</p>

<p>"Fine." The brunette caved. "I know how much you wanna get your groove on."</p>

<p>They followed their friends into the crush.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Cordelia and Xander were in the dancing crowd, their minds occupied by the point at which
their lives would start to go down different paths. Trying to be the good boyfriend,
Xander had told Cordelia not to worry and that they would figure things out eventually.
Truth of it was, he was just as consumed by her possible departure as she was. And now
that they were slowly building a game plan for the Ascension, things had to be decided
soon.</p>

<p>"Thanks for this." She told him.</p>

<p>"How did you -?" He stopped himself.</p>

<p>"I checked the store's copy of the receipt." She smiled. "You didn't have to."</p>

<p>"Yes I did."</p>

<p>"It means...a lot."</p>

<p>He smiled now. "You're welcome."</p>

<p>They didn't speak for a few minutes after that, immersing themselves in the music, swaying
and moving calmly. The cheerleader closed her eyes, and leaned her head against her
boyfriend's shoulder. She had finally decided. She tortured herself over it, but she had
finally decided.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking..." Cordelia said softly. "I'd love to go on your road trip with you."</p>

<p>"And I'd love the company. We can see the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, Vegas..."</p>

<p>"Just the two of us...yeah, it'll be great." She knew they would have a great time.
"But -"</p>

<p>"You're gonna go to LA."</p>

<p>He had known in the back of his mind what her decision was going to be; he just didn't
want to acknowledge it. Now he had no choice.</p>

<p>"I have to. I've looked at it from every angle, and this is the best thing for me. I have
to learn how to live on my own, and I know if I stay, Buffy, Faith, Willow, you, will all
help me, but I'm tired of relying on other people. I won't make it very far if I keep
doing that."</p>

<p>"I understand, Cordy, I -"</p>

<p>"You're the only reason I have to stay. Well, you and my friends. Just because I move
doesn't mean we're over. LA's not that far, and long-distance relationships can work if
people want them to. And I want us to."</p>

<p>"That's a plus." He sighed.</p>

<p>"Please don't be upset." She said with a pleading edge to her voice. "This isn't about
you, it's about me. I love you, Xander."</p>

<p>"I love you too." She looked him in the eye. "And if LA is what you want, then I'll
support you all the way." They kissed. "I'm coming up there every weekend when you get
set."</p>

<p>"You better."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The watchers, both former and current, were standing by the hors-d'oeuvre table, observing
the event.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say this is all rather odd to me." Wesley commented, dipping a piece of
miniature food into the, well, dip.</p>

<p>"Oh yes. At an all-male preparatory they didn't go in for this sort of thing." Giles said.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Unless you count the nights you made the lower classmen get up as
girls and watched them..." He cut himself off, seeing the older male's glare, and ate the
food. "Dip is tasty, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure..." Somebody familiar was making their way over to them, somebody Giles never
thought he'd see in formal wear. "Angel?"</p>

<p>"Hi, Giles." They watched Wesley walk off. "Did I miss it?"</p>

<p>"No." The librarian smiled. "Your wardrobe seems to have expanded."</p>

<p>"It's a rental." Angel grimaced. "And it really itches."</p>

<p>"If it's any consolation, it's appropriate." Giles said with a grin. "I do understand
about static cling, though. It can be quite a bugger."</p>

<p>Wesley came back over with a cup of punch. "I know a fantastic way to get rid of that, if
you're interested."</p>

<p>Angel and Giles stared at him with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>A bit later, Faith and Buffy were standing by the punch table, replenishing their lost
fluids due to dance exhaustion, as the awards ceremony was going on. They weren't really
paying attention. Some idiot was up on stage because he had won class clown, and they
weren't interested. They both noticed Angel, but besides wondering why he was there, they
hadn't said anything to him.</p>

<p>"No more fast dances, okay?" Faith asked the blonde. "Dresses aren't made for that kinda
movin'."</p>

<p>"No more fast dances." Buffy promised. "I'm as wiped as you are."</p>

<p>"Havin' fun?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you're around, fun is guaranteed."</p>

<p>Faith wrapped her arm around her girlfriend's waist, careful not to step on the dress, and
kissed her hair.</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>They watched as Jonathan came on stage, and lowered the microphone to his level.</p>

<p>"We have one more award to give out. Is Buffy Summers here tonight? Did she, um..." He
said, looking around.</p>

<p>The whole crowd turned around, and looked at the slayers. They were both nervous.
Especially Buffy, who dropped her cup. Faith watched and drew in a breath.</p>

<p>(Buffy's ring just fell out of her hand. The objects' impact seemed to resonate through
the building)</p>

<p>She replaced "ring" with "cup", noticed they were all staring, and she thought she might
hyperventilate. She couldn't see their expressions, but...</p>

<p>(...the last thing she saw, were their glaring eyes. Their hatred. Their judgement.
Everything that was negative was in their eyes)</p>

<p>"This is actually a new category. First time ever. I guess there were a lot of write-in
ballots, and, um, the prom committee asked me to read this." Jonathan continued.</p>

<p>"'We're not good friends. Most of us never found the time to get to know you, but that
doesn't mean we haven't noticed you. We don't talk about it much, but it's no secret that
Sunnydale High isn't really like other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here.'"</p>

<p>"Demons!" The crowd yelled out.</p>

<p>(How dare you disgrace the House of the Lord! Be gone with you! Demons!)</p>

<p>"Zombies! Hyena people! Snyder!" They went down the list, laughing.</p>

<p>Jonathan went ahead. "'But, whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened, you
seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been saved by you, or helped
by you at one time or another. We're proud to say that the Class of '99 has the lowest
mortality rate of any graduating class in Sunnydale history'."</p>

<p>Everyone applauded.</p>

<p>"'And we know at least part of that is because of you.'  So the senior class, offers its
thanks, and gives you, uh, this." He produced a multicolored, glittering, miniature
umbrella with a small metal plaque attached to the shaft. "It's from all of us, and it has
written here, 'Buffy Summers, Class Protector.'" He remembered something. "Oh, and the
class would also like to extend its thanks to Faith. Even though you're not a student
here, you've saved many of our lives. Thanks." He finished, smiling sheepishly.</p>

<p>People had been waiting to clap, and they did so enthusiastically, as well as cheered.
Faith was stunned. Seeing the correlation between this and her dream, at least in her
mind, she was waiting for everything to fall apart, but that didn't happen. Buffy pulled
on her hand.</p>

<p>They didn't get separated either. They were walking up to the stage. She could make out
Xander, Willow, Oz, Cordelia, Giles, and Angel, in the crowd now. All smiling. When they
reached their destination, she smiled at Jonathan, as Buffy accepted the award. The much
deserved award.</p>

<p>Everyone was still cheering.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>After the commotion had died down, Faith found herself standing next to Angel. Buffy had
become somewhat rejuvenated, and was back on the floor.</p>

<p>"You make that penguin suit work, Big Guy." She complimented him.</p>

<p>It still itched.</p>

<p>"Were you surprised?" He asked.</p>

<p>"You could say that." People were pretty decent sometimes. She was done being worried.
"I'm in such a good mood, that if you wanna go dance with her, I won't be threatened."</p>

<p>Angel shook his head. "I think it's you she's waiting for." He smiled. "Go to her. And
congratulations."</p>

<p>"Tha -" The vampire was gone.</p>

<p>She walked over to her date, friend, lover, and partner, put her arms around the other
girl's neck wordlessly, and they began dancing to a slow song that had come on.</p>

<p align=center>(Crazy how it feels tonight<br>
Crazy how you make it all alright love<br>
You crush me with the things you do<br>
I do for you anything too</p>

<p align=center>(Sitting, smoking, feeling high<br>
In this moment it feels so right<br>
Lovely lady<br>
I am at your feet<br>
God I want you so badly)</p>

<p>"Tonight was perfect." Buffy said, slipping her arms around Faith's neck as well,
intentionally dragging her fingers through the brown hair.</p>

<p align=center>(I wonder this<br>
Could tomorrow be<br>
So wondrous as you there sleeping</p>

<p align=center>(Let's go drive 'til morning comes<br>
Watch the sunrise<br>
To fill our souls up<br>
Drink some wine 'til we get drunk</p>

<p align=center>(It's crazy I'm thinking<br>
Just knowing that the world is round<br>
Here I'm dancing on the ground<br>
Am I right side up or upside down<br>
Is this real or am I dreaming)</p>

<p>"Glad you think so." Faith responded, placing a light kiss on the blonde's lips.</p>

<p align=center>(Lovely lady<br>
Let me drink you please<br>
I won't spill a drop, I promise you<br>
Lying under this spell you cast on me</p>

<p align=center>(Each moment<br>
The more I love you<br>
Crush me<br>
Come on</p>

<p align=center>(It's crazy I'm thinking<br>
Just knowing that the world is round<br>
Here I'm dancing on the ground<br>
Am I right side up or upside down<br>
Is it real or am I dreaming)</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p align=center>(Lovely lady I will treat you sweetly<br>
Adore you<br>
I mean<br>
You crush me</p>

<p align=center>(It's times like these<br>
When my faith I feel<br>
And I know<br>
How I love you</p>

<p align=center>(Come on<br>
Lady<br>
It's crazy I'm thinking<br>
Just as long as you're around<br>
And here I'll be dancing on the ground)</p>

<p>"But what?" Faith was scared.</p>

<p align=center>(Am I right side up or upside down<br>
To each other we'll be facing<br>
By love we'll beat back the pain<br>
we've found</p>

<p align=center>(You know<br>
I mean to tell you all the things I've been<br>
thinking deep inside<br>
My friend</p>

<p align=center>(With each moment the more I love you<br>
Crush me<br>
Come on<br>
Lady)</p>

<p>"I'm sick of formal wear. I'm avoiding it for the rest of my life."</p>

<p align=center>(So much you have given love<br>
That I would give you back<br>
Again and again<br>
Meaning I'll hold you</p>

<p align=center>(And please<br>
Let me always)</p>

<p>"So the quicker we can get it off, the better?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm thinking, honey." Buffy grinned.</p>

<p>"Now we're talkin' about a dance I'm skilled at."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you are." The song was over, and they were still standing there. "That was
your cue. We can go."</p>

<p>"Right." They sped through the crowd. "So if formal wear is out, does that mean the
wedding'll be casual?"</p>

<p>That would mean that her dream had been really off the mark.</p>

<p>"Repeat, please?"</p>
