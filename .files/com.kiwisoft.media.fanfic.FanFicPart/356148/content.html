<!-- The Reason \ Part 5 -->

<p>"Okay, if I tell you something do you promise not to kill me?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Faith knows."</p>
<p>"Faith knows what?"</p>
<p>"Faith knows about the two of us."</p>
<p>"WHAT?!" Cordelia yelled into the phone. "How come she knows?"</p>
<p>Buffy sighed softly, switching the phone to the other ear. "I told her."</p>
<p>"When did you tell her?"</p>
<p>"Last week, you remember the day after my birthday? I left the cafeteria after fighting with Xander... well I went to the library for my training session with Faith."</p>
<p>"So what did she say?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled, remembering Faith's reaction. "She was a little shocked that I was, as she put it 'a switch hitter', but then she seemed really cool with the idea."</p>
<p>"She wasn't shocked that it was me you're seeing?"</p>
<p>"No, she said it figured as much. Opposites attract."</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled. "You can't really get much more opposite than us I suppose."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but we do seem to get along quite well when we aren't fighting and trying to hurt each other."</p>
<p>"That sounds really bad."</p>
<p>"It's true though. Something always happens and we end up fighting."</p>
<p>"If we try hard enough, we might be able to avoid disaster Buffy."</p>
<p>"I know. And I want to, it's just that we ended up apart before..."</p>
<p>Cordelia sighed. "Yes, but we're together now."</p>
<p>"Alright, so I. m overreacting."</p>
<p>"Glad you realize it." Cordelia teased, "So is Faith gonna keep her mouth shut?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh. I told her I'd kick her ass if she leaked it to anyone."</p>
<p>"Great. So I'll see you tomorrow morning?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, I'll be there."</p>
<p>"Alright, sleep tight."</p>
<p>"Same to you. Good night."</p>
<p>Hanging up the phone, Cordelia lay back down on her bed and stared at the ceiling. This is insane... dating a woman. I hate how we have this secret from everyone, why is society so mental? I wish we could just walk down the hallway at school and hold hands, or even kiss each other in public. Cordelia smiled as she pictured that scenario in her mind. It seems like Buffy would be the kind of person who wouldn't care what people thought of her, after all she's already used to being a little different than most. I could never have this come out while we're still in high school. My reputation would go all to hell. Cordelia narrowed her eyes at that thought. Her reputation had already been dragged through the mud this year and she had survived. Being seen with Buffy in public didn't seem all that bad now. I'll leave it up to her. She finally decided, too tired to continue debating.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Buffy clicked the end button on the phone and stood up off the floor. Having Cordelia not bite her head off for confiding in Faith was a huge victory. She had been afraid that their relationship would be set back another couple of months over her own frustration about their secret. It wasn't like she was burning to tell everyone that she was involved with Cordelia, she didn't want to be even more of an outcast than she was already. It just seemed typical that this would be yet another thing she would have to keep from the general public. She at least had her group of friends to share her slaying with, but this? Xander barely accepts my friendship with his ex-girlfriend, he would go ballistic if he knew I was dating her. Willow can pretend to tolerate Cordelia, but it would just strain our friendship. Giles on the other hand, would probably accept it just as he would an ancient prophecy... calm and accepting. Buffy giggled at that thought. Cordelia wouldn't want this out anyway, she has her popularity to consider until the end of the school year and Buffy understood that completely.</p>
<p>Her mind made up, she crawled into bed, exhausted from just thinking about the complications. Just before she drifted off she made her decision. I told Faith, now Cordelia can be the next one to break down and tell someone.</p>
