<P>I do not, in any way, own Hannah Montana. I am very upset about that, by the way.</P><P><B>Chapter oo1: Friendly Feelings? </B><P><I>'Feelings develop. It's not like I can control them!' </I>Miley thought to herself while she was lying on the couch upside down, her feet in the air. She never thought anything like this would ever happen. It was a little scary, but she knew she'd have to get used to being head over heels for her best friend. She could tell her feelings were the 'forever kind'. She reviewed these thoughts numerous times, trying to convince herself that these were just friendly feelings. <I>Really</I>...friendly feelings, she knew she was totally falling for Lily.</P><P>The patio doors swung open with force and hit the walls behind them. Miley lifted her head over the top of the couch. "Hey Oliver," she said, swinging her feet down and getting off the couch.</P><P>"Hey Oliver?" Oliver asked, his eyes wide.</P><P>"Umm..."</P><P>"HEY OLIVER?" His eyes seemed to grow with each syllable.</P><P>"Yes?" Miley questioned him and herself.</P><P>"'HEY OLIVER' IS NOT HOW YOU GREET YOUR BEST FRIEND WHO IS IN A DELICATE STATE OF 'OH MY GOD!' AFTER ONE OF HIS BEST FRIENDS TELLS HIM THAT SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THE OTHER!"</P><P>Oliver was quite lucky nobody was home or Miley would have tackled him to the ground and hit him repeatedly for that one.</P><P>"Oliver!" Miley yelled, putting her hand on his shoulder. "Calm down."</P><P>"Calm down?" He began again.</P><P>Miley put her hand over his mouth and lead him upstairs and into her room. She locked the door behind them. Oliver wanderingly sat down on Miley's bed, his eyes fixed upon the wall directly in front of him. Miley grabbed her silver chair with the purple cushion from her vanity, set it right in front of Oliver and sat down.</P><P>"Listen," she began. "You can't tell Lily."</P><P>"I know," he said.</P><P>"You can't tell anybody for that matter. I'm not ready..."</P><P>"I promise I won't tell anybody," Oliver said.</P><P>Miley looked at him with worry.</P><P>"Are you totally freaked?" She asked.</P><P>"Freaked? No. Completely shocked? Definitely."</P><P>Miley smiled. As big of a donut as Oliver is, it's moments like this when she remembers why they are best friends to begin with.</P><P>"So, are you gonna tell her?" Oliver asked.</P><P>Miley started laughing that fake, uncomfortable laugh that was so familiar to Oliver's ears.</P><P>"Boy, you are funny!" She exclaimed.</P><P>"Miley, seriously, I think you should tell her," he said seriously.</P><P>"Oliver, I really don't think I can," she said quietly. "She's my best friend. I'm not supposed to like her that way. Plus, they are just feelings. They come and go," she told Oliver, knowing it was a lie.</P><P>He gave her a look. It was the kind of look that didn't need words. Miley knew she was trying to fool herself. They both knew it wouldn't work.</P><P>"Ill think about it..." she said softly. "But this could destroy everything."<p>"You know Lily wouldn't let that happen. And who knows. Maybe she likes you too," he said reassuringly.<p>"Oliver, I know for a fact that she doesn't. But you're right..it's not fair to keep this from her. She has a right to know why I've been acting this way," Miley recalled earlier that day when she could barely speak around her best friend.<p>"Nothing is gonna change," Oliver said. "You'll be best friends no matter what."</P>
