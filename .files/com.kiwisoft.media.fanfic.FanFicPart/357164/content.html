<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 15: Switching - Part 1-->

<P>In City Hall, Trick walked into the Mayor’s office carrying two, very old-looking swords. Allan was in the room as well, watching nervously as the Mayor read the paper.</P>
<P>"Check these out." Trick said, laying the swords on the Mayor’s desk.</P>
<P>"I just love the Family Circus! That P.J., he's getting to be quite a handful." He said chuckling, and turning his attention to the swords. "Well...I haven't seen anything like this in… well, a good long while. Where's the owner of these fine implements?"</P>
<P>"The common term is 'slain'. Faith thought you might find these interesting. I've been seeing this breed around. Are we expecting any trouble?"</P>
<P>"Do you like Family Circus?"</P>
<P>"I like Marmaduke."</P>
<P>The Mayor was disgusted. "He's always on the furniture. Unsanitary."</P>
<P>"Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do. That's my kinda dog."</P>
<P>"I like to read Cathy." Allan said, smiling. They gave him a look. "So…what about these swords? What should we do about that?"</P>
<P>"Well, let's just keep an eye out. We've got the dedication coming up in a few days. We certainly can't have anything interfering with that." The Mayor said.</P>
<P>"Well, maybe we should postpone the...dedication."</P>
<P>"I believe the Honorable Mayor hates that idea." Trick said.</P>
<P>"The dedication...is the final step before my Ascension. I have waited longer than you can imagine for this. After the Hundred Days, I'll be on a higher plane. And I'll have no more need for…well, let's just say I won't be concerned... with the little things.  </P>
<P>"Mr. Trick, watch these people. Anything you find out about them, well, lets just see that that information reaches our resident spunky do-gooder. Who knows? With any luck, they'll kill each other. Then everyone's a winner. Everyone, of course, meaning me." He chuckled.</P>

<p>The gang was sitting in the lounge at school. Willow had several large envelopes around her. Buffy sat next to her, looking at them. </P>
<P>"Willow, what are these?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"They're early admission packets."</P>
<P>"Harvard... Yale... Wesleyan... Some German Polytechnical Institute whose name…I can't pronounce. Is anyone else intimidated? 'Cause I'm just expecting thin slips of paper with the words 'No Way' written in crayon."</P>
<P>"They're typing those now." Oz said.</P>
<P>Xander nodded his understanding.</P>
<P>"I'm so overwhelmed! I got in! To actual colleges! And, and they're wooing me! They're pitching woo!" Willow said excitedly.</P>
<P>"The wooing stage is always fun." Buffy smiled, but there was sadness in her eyes.</P>
<P>"But it's weird. Now, rejection I can handle 'cause of the years of training, but this..."</P>
<P>"I feel your pain, Will. Like right now, I'm torn between the fast-growing fields of appliance repair and motel management. Of course, I'm still waiting to hear back from the Corndog Emporium, so..." Xander said.</P>
<P>"Well, I think it's great. Early admission. Now there's nothing standing between you and a brilliant future." Buffy said.</P>
<P>Willow looked at Buffy and squeezed her hand. The conversation occurring between them was quick, but a lot was said.</P>
<p><I>‘You can’t stay here because of me.’</P>
<P>‘I am. I’m just excited, but I’m not going anywhere.’</P>
<P>‘You have –’ </I> </P>
<P>The gang was watching them. Cordelia spoke up.</P>
<P>"Hello? You guys coming back from the Twilight Zone anytime soon?"</P>
<P>"Sorry." They both said.</P>
<P>"Well, if I may suggest, graduate. Gettin' left back, not the thrill ride you'd expect." Oz said.</P>
<P>"So, life beyond high school. Anyone, please... chime in." Xander said.</P>
<P>"I hear it's nice. And a place I'll never go if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's chemistry test tomorrow." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Oh! I can help. Chemistry's easy. It's a lot like witchcraft, only less newt. So whadaya say? Study jam, my house, tonight?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"I'm there." The bell rang, and they all got ready to go to class. "Oh. I have to go see Giles, report on last night's patrol."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah. He said he wanted to talk to you."</P>
<P>"What about? Is he okay?"</P>
<P>"He's looked better."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the library, Wesley was speaking with Giles. Giles wasn’t having very much fun, and was watching the new man get books out of boxes he had shipped with him on the plane. </P>
<P>"Of course, training procedures have been updated quite a bit since your day. Much greater emphasis on field work." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"Really?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yes. Not all books and theory nowadays. I have, in fact, faced two vampires myself. Under controlled circumstances, of course."</P>
<P>"Well, no danger of finding those here."</P>
<P>"Vampires?"</P>
<P>"Controlled circumstances." Buffy came in. "Hello, Buffy."</P>
<P>"Well...Hello." Wesley said, cautiously.</P>
<P>"New Watcher?" Buffy asked, looking Wesley up and down.</P>
<P>Giles was about to respond, but Wesley interrupted him.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am. Normally, I would introduce myself, however, that is rather pointless."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>Wesley whistled, and two well-built men came into the library.</P>
<P>"I would advise you not to fight. This will go easier for everyone, if you just go along with us."</P>
<P>"What is the meaning of this?" Giles asked, walking over to Buffy.</P>
<P>"It is my belief that Miss Summers is too far gone to respond to any kind of authority, and therefore must be removed from her duties as soon as possible. She will be taken to England, and the Council will past judgement."</P>
<P>"I will not stand for this!" Giles said, clearly enraged.</P>
<P>"You no longer have any say, Mr. Giles. The Council informed me of the way you have been corrupted. Sad, really."</P>
<P>"You don’t even know me. What about Faith?" Buffy said.</P>
<P>"I know enough. Faith will be dealt with, but you are priority. Gentlemen, we may have to restrain her."</P>
<P>The two men came over to her. One tried to cuff her, but of course, she fought him, elbowing him in the stomach. The man fell; however, the other man quickly stuck a needle in the only place he could reach.</P>
<P>Buffy immediately collapsed, unconscious.</P>
<P>"I have to escort her back to London. Can I trust, Mr. Giles, that you will keep an eye on my belongings?"</P>
<P>"I’ll keep an eye on them all right." Giles grabbed Wesley’s shirt and slammed him into the table. "Tell them to back off."</P>
<P>"Now…Mr. Giles you know I cannot do that. You know the Council’s decisions are final, and they trust my assessments. They have been rather kind to allow you to stay here, however, if you attack me, or interfere, they will not hesitate to deal with you."</P>
<P>Giles let him go.</P>
<P>"Pick her up. We must not waste any time." </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In an armored truck, Buffy was sitting on a wooden bench in the back. Her arms were chained to it. Wesley and one of the men were sitting back there with her.</P>
<P>"You don’t know what you’re doing." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Don’t I?"</P>
<P>"In case you haven’t noticed, I have done my job. You know, saved the world?"</P>
<P>"True, but if I’m correct that would not have been necessary if you had not gotten involved with Angelus. Mr. Giles should have forbade it from the start."</P>
<P>"Don’t bring Giles or Angel into this. I fixed my mistake."</P>
<P>"At the expense of a Slayer." Buffy looked down at her feet. "Surely you can see how the Council cannot accept this kind of recklessness."</P>
<P>"You wanna talk recklessness? Look up, Faith. The bad one. The one who joined up with the baddies in town."</P>
<P>Wesley’s face was expressionless.</P>
<p>"As I said before, Faith will be dealt with. If necessary."</P>
<p>"If necessary?"</P>
<p>The truck stopped. A few minutes later, the back door opened. The driver was standing there.</P>
<p>"Cop."</P>
<p>"Ah, I see. I’ll handle it. Watch her."</P>
<p>Wesley exited the truck, and the driver came inside. </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Up ahead of the truck some fifty feet, was a cop standing out in front of his car. Faith waited until Wesley’s attention was diverted completely to the cop, and ran over to the back of the truck. She rushed inside, and quickly kicked the two men directly in their heads, with enough force that they slumped, unconscious to the floor.</P>
<p>She looked at Buffy on the bench.</P>
<p>"Getting kinky with two guys and chains, B? Never knew you had it in you."</P>
<p>"What are you doing here?"</P>
<p>"Don’t worry. The cops will keep the Brit busy."</P>
<p>"You did this?"</P>
<p>"I can do a lot more. Frankly, I thought that since I was coming to rescue you, you’d be more grateful."</P>
<p>"And why would you do that?"</P>
<p>"Open your eyes, B. The company you work for is about to ship you three thousand miles away because you didn’t save the world the right way. You bust your ass, and instead of getting thanks, you get chained."</P>
<p>"I’ll go, the Council will let me go when they find out I haven’t done anything wrong…"</P>
<p>"Really? I talked to this guy. He came here to do this to you, and I’m next. They aren’t gonna give you a fair trial, they’re going to get rid of you."</P>
<p>"Why didn’t he take you when you talked to him?"</P>
<p>"I…convinced him to hold off on me."</P>
<p>"Convinced being?"</P>
<p>"You really wanna know?"</P>
<p>"Forget it."</P>
<p>"We have to stick together on this. He doesn’t give a damn about you, and definitely doesn’t give a damn about me. Screw him and the rules. We were built to search and destroy, and if I had my way, I’d off the guy myself."</P>
<p>"But…"</P>
<p>"When are you gonna learn? Slayers are just on one huge assembly line. We’re just things. You don’t get any rights. Once you realize that you enjoy fighting and slaying, and that you don’t have to treat it like a job that holds you back, it’ll be a whole lot more fun.  Live a little, B. Worry about yourself for once. Coming?"</P>
<p>Buffy, easily broke the restraints on the bench, and stood up. Faith looked out.</P>
<p>"Damn! He’s coming back."</P>
<p>"Go. I’ll be fine."</P>
<p>They looked at each other, jumped out of the truck, and ran in opposite directions.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The gang was sitting in the library. All their faces were sunken. Buffy was gone, on her way to England. Giles was pacing and cursing quietly to himself. Willow was standing by the double doors, praying for Buffy to come walking through them.</P>
<p>"Giles why didn’t you –" Willow started to say.</P>
<p>"He would have been taken away too, if he had attacked this new guy." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Then we’d be stuck here, and wait to die." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"As much as I think the guy who took her should be beaten senseless, they’re right, Will." Xander said.</P>
<p>Willow sighed.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry. I just…"</P>
<p>"I understand, Willow. I wish I could have done more." Giles said.</P>
<p>Buffy came through the library doors, smiling.</P>
<p>"What’s with the gloom?" She asked.</P>
<p>Willow went wide-eyed for a minute, and crushed Buffy in hug.</P>
<p>"We…I…you’re…" Willow couldn’t find words.</P>
<p>She, without even realizing what she was doing, kissed Buffy long, and softly. Buffy was somewhat dazed when they broke apart.</P>
<p>"Did I just…"</P>
<p>"Yeah. You did."  Buffy had a happy grin on her face.</P>
<p>The gang was slack-jawed, and Giles just watched calmly from the counter. If he was surprised, he didn’t show it.</P>
<p>"Wow." Cordelia said. "I’ve never seen anybody –" </P>
<p>"Somebody rate that." Xander said.</P>
<P>"10." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Uh, guys? I think…" Buffy started, looking at Willow’s beet red face. They had never kissed in front of their friends before. </P>
<p>"Sorry, Will. Um, so anyway, we all thought you were on the plane to the mother country by now." Xander said, obviously still blown away by the sheer love that was behind the kiss.</P>
<p>"Do you really think I’d let my friends," She looked Willow directly in the eye, "be defenseless, and alone?"</P>
<p>"How did you –" Giles started.</P>
<p>"His measures of security weren’t that tight."</P>
<p>"You just escaped?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Buffy, that was not –"</P>
<p>"Oh, come on Giles. You know they’re wrong. Forget them. You are the only one I ever listened to, and it’s gonna stay that way. He tries to take me to England to kill me, and I’m supposed to stand for that?"</P>
<p>There were shocked looks all around.</P>
<p>"Where did you learn this?" Giles asked.</P>
<p>Just then, Wesley came through the doors. Buffy whirled around, and grabbed him by the neck.</P>
<p>"Oh look, I caught a murderer. Oz can you open the cage, please?"</P>
<p>Oz quickly swung open the book cage, and Buffy tossed Wesley inside. She shut and locked the door. Wesley was choking.</P>
<p>"How…did you…"</P>
<p>"Giles what’s his name?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Wesley."</P>
<p>"Well, Wesley, your Council seems to underestimate their employees. You’re going to stay in there for awhile."</P>
<p>"You’re in more trouble then you realize."</P>
<p>"Me? I could have you arrested. You were bringing me to your bosses to kill me, right? How were you gonna do it, cause I’d like to see how you’d react. Was it going to be slow or fast? Just be glad I’m feeling a bit more chipper right now."</P>
<p>Wesley was silent. Giles walked up to the cage, shades of ‘Ripper’ in his eyes.</P>
<p>"Be glad there’s a cage between us. I wouldn’t be as merciful, believe me."</P>
<p>Even though everyone agreed with Buffy’s course of action and thought that Wesley deserved a lot more then he was receiving; they couldn’t help but notice a change in Buffy. This was unlike her.</P>
<p>"Now, should we be doing something?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>Willow looked at Buffy, wanting to talk. Buffy told her ‘not now’ and looked up like she remembered something.</P>
<p>"I wanted to tell you about patrol last night. I found some swords on the ground. They weren’t the same size, and they had jewels and stuff."</P>
<p>"Hmm…El Eliminati. Fifteenth Century..." Giles said remembering.</P>
<P>"Fifteenth Century duelist cult, deadly in their day. Their numbers dwindled in later centuries due to an increase in  anti-vampire activity and a lot of pointless dueling." Wesley said from inside the cage.</P>
<p>"For someone caged, you sure do have a lot to say." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"He may be of help, Buffy."</P>
<p>Buffy huffed, and threw up her arms. "Fine. Speak."</P>
<P>"They eventually became the acolytes of a demon called Balthazar, who brought them to the New World, specifically here."</P>
<P>"So why have we not seen them before this?"</P>
<P>"They were driven out a hundred years ago. Happily, Balthazar was killed. I don't know by whom."</P>
<p>"So is this their five-hundred year reunion party?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"Balthazar had an amulet purported to give him strength. It was buried with him, and I believe the few remaining Eliminati are probably looking for it. For sentimental value."</P>
<p>"Sentimental value?" Will ow asked.</P>
<p>"Since when are vampires sentimental?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"I hear they get all teared up on Anne Rice’s birthday." Oz said.</P>
<p>"I should go look for it." Buffy said, getting up.</P>
<p>Willow got up too, and followed her outside the library. Giles opened the cage, and walked inside.</P>
<p>"What are you going to do?" Wesley asked, frightened.</P>
<p>Giles started gathering up all the weapons hanging up inside.</P>
<p>"I can’t very well let you have access to deadly weaponry, now can I?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Buffy, are you  okay?" Willow asked out in the hall.</P>
<p>"Fine. Why wouldn’t I be?"</P>
<p>"I don’t know…you just…it’s nothing."</P>
<p>"Then I’ll see you tomorrow okay?"</P>
<p>"Tonight, Buffy."</P>
<p>"Huh?"</P>
<p>"Chemistry test? Study jam?"</P>
<p>"Oh yeah, I’ll be there."</P>
<p>Buffy walked away, leaving Willow worried.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later that night, Buffy was searching a crypt in the graveyard. The large room was dark and dusty. In the center were two stone coffins. There were several drawers on one wall and a few urns on shelves. Buffy took the steps down into the room and went to the first coffin. She pushed the heavy lid aside and looked into it with the flashlight she was carrying. All that was left of the body was the skeleton and a pile of hair and fibers.</P>
<P>"Strike one. No amulet there."</P>
<P>She went to the next coffin and pushed its lid aside. The body inside was dried out, but the amulet hung around its neck. </P>
<P>"Game over."</P>
<P>She reached in for it, but jerked back up when she heard noises coming from outside. Through the door she saw torches coming closer and voices. She quickly jumped up onto the first coffin, rolled into it and twisted off her flashlight just as Vincent, the leader of the Eliminati, pushed the door open. He looked around, but didn’t notice when Buffy pulled the lid of the coffin back into place. Vincent walked down the stairs and went over to the open coffin. His men followed him. </P>
<P>Vincent looked into the open coffin, saw the amulet and took it out. The Eliminati started to make their way out. When Buffy heard the door close she pushed the lid back open and climbed out, only to be startled by Faith's hand on her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Faith!"</P>
<P>"What are you doing, hiding in there?"</P>
<P>"Looking for something. Wasn't counting on the Special Guest Stars. Six against one. Hence the hiding."</P>
<P>"Well, it's six against two now, so come on."</P>
<P>She rushed out of the crypt. Buffy climbed out of the coffin and followed her out. They came out in time to see the last two Eliminati jump down through a manhole into the sewers. Faith made her way toward it.</P>
<P>"Wait. Stop." Faith stopped reluctantly. "What’s going on here?"</P>
<P>"You’re looking for the amulet, right?"</P>
<p>"How’d you know?"</P>
<p>"Boss is looking for it too. He wants those guys floating in the wind."</P>
<p>"Aren’t you supposed to be friends with vampires?"</P>
<p>"Not these."</P>
<p>They started toward the manhole again.</P>
<p>"Why am I not attacking you? You’re…"</P>
<p>"Living life on my own terms. Like you should. Besides, you have to slay, it’s your job, and I saved your life, remember? So let’s go."</P>
<p>"It's a manhole. Tight space, no escape, six against two, not unlike three against one."</P>
<P>"And there might be more," She grabbed Buffy’s arm, "so come on." </P>
<P>"You're just gonna go down there? That's your plan?"</P>
<P>"Who said I had a plan? I don't know how many’s down there, but I wanna find out. And I'll know when I land. If you don't come in after me, I might die! You wouldn’t want that on your perfect ‘do the right thing’ conscious, would you?"</P>
<P>Faith jumped in, and Buffy soon followed.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Faith ended up having their hands full fighting the Eliminati. Buffy did a low front snap kick to one of them on the ground. Faith backhand punched another, and his head snapped hard to the side. Buffy grabbed yet another and shoved him aside.</P>
<P>"We're surrounded!" She yelled.</P>
<P>"You noticed that, too?"</P>
<P>Faith backhand punched another one. Buffy ducked a vampire's swing and did a roundhouse kick to the back of his knee, making him collapse to the floor. Faith sidestepped her attacker, grabbed his arm, swung him around and threw him toward a wall. Buffy did a full spinning hook kick to an incoming vampire and followed up with a roundhouse kick to his head. </P>
<P>Another one came at her from the side and tried to bring his sword down on her from above, but she stepped back in time, and it clanged on the floor. Faith threw her vampire up against a wall, and he collapsed. She did a half-spinning hook kick to another one behind her, and he fell dazed onto a raised area. Another vampire jumped up onto it and leapt at Faith. She sidestepped him and pulled him down over the other one.</P>
<P>Buffy did a back elbow jab at a vampire's face, causing him to step backwards and trip over a fallen vampire. Another one jumped in and tried to punch her, but she blocked him, grabbed onto his arm and threw him up against the rock wall. He tried to come at her again, but she side kicked him in the gut, forcing him back up against the wall. </P>
<P>The Eliminatus who was down got up again, and she front kicked him, knocking him hard onto his back. Faith turned around just in time to get punched in the face by Vincent. He tried to punch her again, but she ducked it and rose back up to roundhouse kick him in the side of the head. Buffy blocked two punches from the vampire against the wall and punched him in the face and again in the gut. He went down.</P>
<P>Faith did a half spinning, jumping kick to the head of one of them. Then she high blocked a punch from one behind her. Buffy got a roundhouse kick in the head and fell to the ground by a pool of water. Her attacker advanced on her, and she roundhouse kicked him in the back of the knee, making him lose his balance.</P>
<P>Faith punched one in the head, but he came back with a punch to Faith's gut and grabbed her.</P>
<P>"Lemme go!"</P>
<P>He shoved her hard against a concrete wall. Buffy saw Faith and threw her stake into the vampire's back as she got up from the floor. He burst into ashes. Faith gave Buffy a smile. However, with her attention on Faith, Buffy didn't notice the one behind her, and he grabbed her and held her still for Vincent. He held out his long sword, pointing it at her chest.</P>
<P>"Let's settle this honorably." Vincent said.</P>
<P>Buffy jumped up against the one holding her and did a kick, knocking the sword out of Vincent's hand. It went flying into the pool of water. Then she shrugged off the one holding her, and he fell to the floor. </P>
<P>Vincent grabbed hold of her though, and tried to thrust at her with his short sword. She jerked out of the way in time and grabbed hold of his arm, but he used this to his advantage and grabbed her around the back with his other arm, pinning her against the edge of the pool.</P>
<P>"Well, then, let's just settle it."</P>
<P>He dunked her head into the water. She struggled to get back up, but couldn’t get a grip on anything. In the meantime, another vampire got Faith in a full Nelson hold. She saw Buffy struggling in the water.</P>
<P>"Buffy!" She yelled over to Vincent. "You son of a bitch!"</P>
<p>Faith knew she could let Buffy die, and that would solve a lot of problems. The boss would be happy, and he wouldn’t have anything to worry about. She would eventually get out of here, anyway. But she didn’t want that.</P>
<p>Buffy had gotten to her. She wanted Buffy on her side. She wanted to fight along side her. Two Chosen Ones on their own. Buffy understood her, and if she was completely honest with herself, she knew she had no one to lean on. She knew she’d never be able to go back to the "good side" so she had to bring Buffy over. She didn’t want her to die.</P>
<P>Vincent kept holding Buffy's head under water. She struggled valiantly to get up, but couldn't. She started to get weak from lack of oxygen and stopped struggling, apparently passing out. He held her under for another few seconds, then let go and turned his attention to Faith. Buffy remained motionless in the water. Vincent grinned at Faith, who kept struggling.</P>
<P>Suddenly Buffy leapt up, Vincent's long sword in hand, and swung it around at his head. He was too quick, though, and ducked it, but was left off balance in a crouch.</P>
<P>"I hate it when they drown me."</P>
<P>She swung at him again, but he reacted instantly, somersaulting out of the way and back to his feet. He faced her wielding his short sword. She made quick work of it, knocking it out of his hand with her first swing. She swung at him again widely, but he managed to dodge her.</P>
<P>Faith broke out of the hold, spun around and punched the vampire in the face. He staggered against the wall. She grabbed him and pulled him around, and he flew up and over the small raised area. She smiled at Buffy in admiration.</P>
<P>"B! Gotta go!" </P>
<P>Buffy missed another swing, but had a determined look on her face.</P>
<P>"We came for the amulet."</P>
<P>She jabbed the sword straight at Vincent, getting the tip right between the chain holding the amulet at his waist. She lifted the sword, drawing the chain out from under his belt, and it slid down the length of the blade to the hilt. Vincent left immediately. Buffy pulled the amulet from the sword and held it in her hand. Faith came up next to her.</P>
<P>"Tell me you don't get off on this!" Faith said.</P>
<P>"It didn't suck."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>It was late night at the library. Everyone had left, and Wesley was still locked in the book cage. Faith came strolling in.</P>
<p>"She locked you up, Wes?"</P>
<p>"Apparently."</P>
<p>"My girl’s really coming around."</P>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</P>
<p>"Newsflash, you’re a fool. How’d they ever let you pass? I’m the bad seed."</P>
<p>Wesley looked horrified.</P>
<p>"I was the first one to use you? You don’t know how happy that makes me."</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<p>"Congratulations. You helped me to start to swing Buffy over to my side. Thanks. Oh, and enjoy imprisonment, asshole." </P>
<p>Faith left the library, smiling.</P>
