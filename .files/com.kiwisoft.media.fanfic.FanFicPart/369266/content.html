<p>Lilly was strangely silent as they got into the car and on the drive to Miley's house. Heather watched her daughter, who was tapping her foot nervously, face stoic. As soon as she pulled up in front of the small cabin, Lilly was out the door, with just a weak 'good-bye' to her mother. She rushed to the door, but reigned in the part of her just wanting to burst through and knocked instead. Grandma Ruby answered the door after just a few seconds. She smiled as she let Lilly in, though Lilly could easily read the concern in her eyes. Ruby motioned towards the sofa and Lilly suddenly felt awkward.</p>
<p>She'd waited so long to hear the truth and now that she finally knew, it just left her feeling empty. Lilly had assumed Miley had actually <b>done </b>something, accidental or purposeful, to cause the townspeople's reaction, but in reality, it was absolutely nothing. Stupid small-town superstitions that ostracized one of the most amazing people Lilly had ever met. She swallowed the lump in her throat and walked closer. What she saw nearly broke her heart.</p>
<p>Miley was curled up across her mother's lap, her forehead covered with white gauze. Susan was rhythmically stroking Miley's hair, a myriad of emotions displayed on her face. And worst of all, Miley seemed to be crying, silent tears leaking from her eyes, while she sniffled occasionally. Lilly had never seen Miley upset, let alone cry and the sight tore at her. She knelt in front of her girlfriend and cupped the girl's cheek. Lilly brushed some tears away with her thumb and leaned forward to press a feather-light kiss to the corner of Miley's mouth.</p>
<p>"Hey Road kill, how you feeling?"</p>
<p>Miley actually smiled at her, not her usual broad grin, but sincerely enough that Lilly's heart fluttered. "I always feel better when you're around."</p>
<p>"Sweet pea, I'm supposed to go to work in a few, I'm gonna call and tell them I can't make it," said Susan softly, helping Miley sit up.</p>
<p>"No, mom, it's okay…Lilly will stay with me. Right?" said Miley, no longer sounding quite as upset and looked at Lilly with big blue eyes.</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't help but smile at her. "Of course, for as long as you want me."</p>
<p>Susan looked between them and sighed after several moments. She brushed a hand affectionately across the top of Miley's head. "Alright, but if anything is wrong, you call. Grandma will be here, too."</p>
<p>She kissed the non-gauze covered side of her daughter's forehead and stood, looking at Lilly who still knelt on the floor. "Lilly, can I talk to you for a second?"</p>
<p>Lilly felt trepidation, but Miley, as always, seemed unconcerned. She switched on the ancient TV sitting against the wall, while Lilly followed Susan into the kitchen. Susan glanced at the back of the sofa, but Miley seemed to not be interested in their conversation. She sighed again. "I just wanted to thank you…for protecting my little girl. Who knows what else they would've done to her."</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed hard as the realization sank in. "Is she okay? She didn't seem upset when I left and now…"</p>
<p>"I think it just took some time to sink in and…those kids…well, Miley's used to people sayin' things about her, but…they told her she killed her daddy and brother."</p>
<p>Lilly gaped at the woman, feeling renewed anger. She remembered her brother's words, the ridiculousness of them and wondered if Susan would confirm them. "Someone told me Miley's…she brings bad luck to everyone. Is that why they hate her?"</p>
<p>Susan scoffed, glancing back at the sofa again. "They didn't believe it at first. Miley was born early, very unexpectedly; an old midwife who lived in town delivered her. Everyone had always called her a witch and whatnot, she <b>was</b> odd, but it wasn't until Miley was born that I truly thought she was crazy. She seemed terrified, said Miley was being born under a bad omen, a solar eclipse. She told the whole town Miley was a harbinger of something evil."</p>
<p>"And then she died?"</p>
<p>"Yes, from a heart attack. She was nearing 90, I believe. But, of course, the first seeds of doubt had been sown. I think most people put it off as silly superstition at first, but even those people who say they don't believe in superstitions, will still follow them, just in case. I think they were just looking so hard for something, it was no wonder they found a 'pattern', but they started shunning her, at school and around town."</p>
<p>"What happened?" Lilly didn't know what to think, how to take it all in and have it make sense. Michael's harsh words continued to ring in her ears. "I heard something about plagues."</p>
<p>Susan shook her head. "Like I said, they were trying hard to find things to have it all make sense. The weeks before Miley was born, there were some things happening, strange perhaps, but not wholly unexplained."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Some livestock died suddenly, a severe drought killed crops and then the creek flooded downstream. People claimed they saw an abundance of scorpions and snakes, just silly things, really. Then after she was born, everyone paid particular attention any time Miley did something, and their 'evidence' mounted.</p>
<p>A dog died days after Miley petted it, a horse went lame, a tire blew, just little things that seemed to pile up. My father died, just days after meeting her for the first time. Then the lightning strikes; after the second, we had to remove her from school. We practically forced her into isolation, hoping that if we kept her away, they'd forget about it. It worked to some degree, and Miley never complained, just happy to be, but when her dad and brother died, everything changed."</p>
<p>Lilly swallowed hard. Everything still sounded absolutely crazy to her. "Miley was in the car when it happened?"</p>
<p>Susan nodded, clenching her jaw at the obviously painful memories. "She can't remember anything about the crash. The police said it looked like lightning struck the car and her daddy lost control. Miley was fine, except for the memory loss. That, plus several unfortunate incidents that happened after, our foreclosure, this house burning down, getting struck by lightning, again, made the townspeople anxious. They think she's bringing evil down upon this town, this family in particular."</p>
<p>"That's ridiculous," said Lilly, wondering how an entire town could have descended so far into madness.</p>
<p>"Yes, to an outsider, but you have to understand how slowly they built up these ideas, how much time they had to sink in. This town has used Miley as a scapegoat to explain away every bad thing that's happened in the past ten years. It would be hard to convince them otherwise. And because of this, I am afraid every time she is out of my sight."</p>
<p>"And Miley knows all this?"</p>
<p>Susan nodded. "Yeah, she knows. But you know how she is – a free spirit, nothing gets to her. I just want to know she's okay."</p>
<p>Lilly glanced at the sofa, briefly. "I will make sure she is."</p>
<p>Susan smiled, putting a hand on Lilly's shoulder. "Thank you, Lilly. I'm glad she found you."</p>
<p>The woman walked away, towards the door, shouting a quick 'goodbye' before she left. Lilly took a deep breath and walked back over to her girlfriend. Miley was stretched out on the sofa and smiled up at her. Lilly sat by her waist, resting an arm on it as she leaned back.</p>
<p>"What did you wanna watch, Road kill?"</p>
<p>"Let's go outside," said Miley, sounding excited.</p>
<p>Lilly frowned. "I think people with holes in their head are supposed to stay inside."</p>
<p>Miley made a face and Lilly thought it was the cutest thing. She laughed and leaned forward, pressing her lips to her girlfriend's gently. She motioned for Miley to sit, and stretched out across the sofa on her back. Miley immediately snuggled into her side, head on Lilly's shoulder, one arm draped across her waist. Lilly ran her hand through the brown curls, mindful of the bandage still taped to Miley's forehead. She sighed.</p>
<p>"I wanna just lay here with you, forever," said Miley softly, her hand clutching Lilly's shirt.</p>
<p>Lilly hugged her closer, wishing she could make all the hurt go away. "Fine by me, Road kill. Fine by me."</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>Lilly sleepily blinked her eyes open, unsure what had awoken her. It was pitch dark in the room, though some moonlight fell in through the window above the bed. A cat mewled outside, but other than that, it was eerily quiet. She sighed and shifted under the warm weight partially on top of her, but it was near impossible to move a sleeping Miley. She was draped almost entirely on top of Lilly's body, head bedded on her chest. Lilly ran a hand through the silky soft hair spilled across her chest, wondering how she had gotten roped into staying, again.</p>
<p>Not that she'd pass up an opportunity to cuddle with her girlfriend, but despite everything Lilly was still somewhat apprehensive of Susan or Grandma Ruby finding them like this. Miley's mom seemed to have warmed up to her at last, and though Grandma Ruby had never shown a dislike for Lilly, considering everything that was going on, she didn't want to take the risk. Not to mention that innocent, little Miley had suddenly started dating a girl and no one had even blinked an eye – Lilly was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p>
<p>Miley stirred, the hand on Lilly's abdomen twitching. "Lilly…"</p>
<p>Lilly stopped her movement, trying to look at the girl's face. "Yeah?" There was silence, again, and Lilly briefly wondered whether she'd imagined hearing her girlfriend speak.</p>
<p>"Lilly is pretty," mumbled Miley against Lilly's chest.</p>
<p>Miley pressed her face into Lilly's chest and curled her fist against her belly. Lilly couldn't help but smirk at the realization that her girlfriend was talking in her sleep. She brushed her hand through the brown curls again, amazed that in her sleep Miley sounded just as honest and sincere as she normally did.</p>
<p>"No, Burt, I won't share my ice cream with you." Miley almost sounded a bit exasperated and Lilly had to bite her lip to keep herself from laughing out loud. "Well…Lilly is my girlfriend…she can have whatever she wants."</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't understand how it was possible for one person to be so damn adorable. She leaned down and kissed the top of Miley's head. Lilly was completely taken with the girl and the speed with which she had fallen for Miley still scared her. She'd always been the aloof one in relationships, going along with the flow but never truly feeling what those other girls had wanted her to. Back in Malibu, Lilly had figured she was just too cool to fall in love and get bogged down in a real relationship, but here she was, cuddling with a girl who had dreams about chickens.</p>
<p>Miley's head suddenly shot up and she blinked the sleep from her eyes, staring at Lilly. She made a face. "Lilly, did you want ice cream?"</p>
<p>Lilly had to work hard to keep a straight face, but managed somehow. She tucked some stray hairs behind Miley's ears. "No, Miles, I'm good."</p>
<p>"Okay," said Miley simply and shifted until she was completely on top of Lilly, resting her head back on her girlfriend's chest. Lilly's hand unconsciously wrapped itself in the dark hair.</p>
<p>"Hey Lilly?" Miley sounded awake now, though her voice was thick with sleep.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Lilly continued her rhythmic stroking of the other girl's hair.</p>
<p>"I really like you."</p>
<p>Lilly stopped her movement, wondering if Miley was making a joke, but she sounded so serious. "I'd hope so, you are my girlfriend, after all."</p>
<p>Miley sighed heavily and Lilly wondered whether she'd said the wrong thing. "No, I mean…I like that you're here…that you make me happy…a-and that…that you don't think I'm evil."</p>
<p>Susan had told her Miley did not let the townspeople's superstitions get to her, but she was wrong, Lilly now knew. Miley did care. And knowing how horrible people were to her and how Miley always pretended it didn't matter, made Lilly's heart ache. She wrapped her arms around the girl on top of her tightly.</p>
<p>"Miles, I can't think of a single person less evil than you. You're absolutely perfect and I wouldn't have you any other way. Those people…they're just crazy. Don't you listen to a thing they say," said Lilly, wishing her words could really make a difference to a girl who had been treated so poorly all her life.</p>
<p>Lilly squeezed her for good emphasis and Miley nodded, but sighed. "Yeah…but sometimes I do wish I could've just waited 24 hours to be born."</p>
<p>Lilly didn't know what to say to that, wondering whether it would've even made a difference with the superstitious townspeople eager for a scapegoat, so she remained silent. Miley seemed to relax against her and was asleep again within minutes, leaving Lilly marveling at the girl's ability to fall asleep anywhere and after anything. She took a deep breath, arms still wrapped around her girlfriend, and tried to let sleep come to her, as well. She thought briefly of Susan or Grandma Ruby finding them like this, but realized it did not matter anymore. Lilly was not going to let go of Miley, no matter what.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"Mom, this is ridiculous!"</p>
<p>Heather sighed, looking at her son in exasperation. "Michael, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but fine…you can go upstairs while we have dinner down here, with Miley."</p>
<p>Lilly stood leaning against the kitchen counter, arms crossed, a sour look on her face. She still couldn't believe her own brother had gotten caught up in the craziness; he'd always been so down-to-earth and reasonable. Ever since that day Lilly had rescued Miley from those jerks throwing rocks at her, Michael had barely spoken to her, unless it was to constantly remind her what a huge mistake she was making. It surely would have come to blows by now, if Lilly hadn't spent most of her time with her girlfriend, far away from him.</p>
<p>He huffed, eyes angry. "Mom, you're making a huge mistake. There is something dangerous about that girl."</p>
<p>"Michael, she's a 16-year-old girl, I can assure you, we'll be fine." said Heather, handing some plates to Lilly to set the table. For once, Lilly didn't complain, just happy to have her mom on her side in this stupid argument.</p>
<p>He shook his head and moved to leave, but turned at the last second. "Fine, I'll be upstairs until she's gone. But don't be surprised if you all end up dead."</p>
<p>Michael left the kitchen abruptly, both his sister and mother staring after him in shock. Lilly suddenly felt sad and angry at the same time, for Miley and for her now broken relationship with her brother. She set the plates on the table and looked at her mother, hoping Michael's words wouldn't eventually sway her parents. "Mom, Miley's a good kid…it's all just crazy talk."</p>
<p>Heather, noticing her daughter's distress, shook her head. "It's bullshit, is what it is. Now, when will Miley be here?"</p>
<p>Despite everything, Lily couldn't help but laugh at her mother's use of inappropriate language. She smiled, suddenly feeling a bit lighter. "Fifteen minutes or so, depends on if she gets distracted on the way."</p>
<p>Heather glanced at Lilly to see if she was joking, but the girl seemed serious enough and for the umpteenth time since hearing about her, the woman couldn't wait to meet this strange girl that had completely taken her daughter's heart.</p>
