<!-- About a Girl \ Part 19 -->

<p>Jessie lowered herself onto the bed shifting around uncomfortably for a moment before deciding that she was only putting off the inevitable and looking up at her father and Lily who were standing just inside the door to their bedroom. </p>

<hr>

<p>Grace walked into the kitchen picking an apple up off of the counter as she glanced over to the side to see Zoë eating peanut butter out of the container with a spoon.</p>

<p>"What do you think you're doing?" Grace asked taking the spoon away from the child with a disgruntled look. "The rest of us eat that stuff too, and we don't want your cooties."</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as cooties," Zoë said condescendingly looking over at Grace.</p>

<p>"Where's mom," Grace asked not really wanting to have to police the little brat.</p>

<p>"Upstairs with Rick and Jessie," Zoë replied going to get another spoon. "She says they're having a serious talk and are not to be disturbed."</p>

<p>"What are they talking about," Grace asked intrigued at the possibility of new gossip, especially if it involved Jessie in any way, shape, or form.</p>

<p>"Jessie snuck out last night, and now she's in BIG trouble," Zoë responded. She'd managed to follow them for a little while before they got into the bedroom and had heard that much, but then her mom had noticed her and shooed her away.</p>

<p>"Really?" Grace asked turning towards the stairs. "Hmmm."</p>

<hr>

<p>"…And what you did is completely unacceptable," Rick continued pacing around in front of the bed. "Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to be wandering around the streets at night? How worried we were that you were dead or worse?" he continued looking over at Jessie sharply.</p>

<p>"We were only ten minutes away," Jessie began but Rick interrupted her not wanting to hear any of that.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter where you went, you shouldn't have been anywhere but in bed in the safety of our house. What you did was … was unacceptable," he repeated again getting himself all flustered and worked up. "You are not to see her…"</p>

<p>Jessie leapt off the bed as she heard this, her face filled with rebellious fire. "You can't stop me from seeing her!" she fired out immediately interrupting the rest of her father speech. "I don't care if you don't like it, it's not your life, it's mine. And I LOVE her! And you can tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about, cause I DO know what I'm talking about, and you can't keep me away from her," she continued blinking back tears as she mentally debated whether she should threaten them with running away and selling her ass on the street. However, before she could decide Rick cut back in finishing his previous statement.</p>

<p>"…see her or anyone else until further notice, because you are SO grounded," he went on, seeing Jessie pout but return to her sitting position on the bed. "As for Katie," he continued his voice lowering again to a reasonable tone, "I know I can't stop you from seeing her. I don't want to stop you from seeing her. But..."</p>

<p>Jessie sighed loudly and irritably at the use of the word `but' but otherwise remained silent.</p>

<p>"Since you are seeing her," Rick continued ignoring Jessie's exhalation, "I'd like to get to know her a bit better. Plus, the two of us need to talk."</p>

<p>"You don't need to talk," Jessie said shaking her head vehemently. There were to be no more talks. "She's had the talk. She's been threatened with shovels and other blunt objects already. Mom gave her the talk, she gave it to her for like twenty minutes," Jessie continued sighing at the memory. "Katie was afraid to look at me afterwards. So you really don't need to have the talk," she finished huffily.</p>

<p>"Karen had the talk with her?" Rick asked surprised. Karen had led him to believe that she hadn't had any concrete knowledge of Jessie's relationship with Katie, just a suspicion. Finding out otherwise didn't please him, not only did it mean she was keeping things from him about his own daughter, but that she had taken away a father's prerogative. It was tradition that the dad threatens whatever boy was trying to get into his daughters pants by pretending in being interested in dating her. Katie was certainly not a boy, but he had a speech ready dammit, and he'd wanted to use it.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Jessie exclaimed. "And she had it with me too. A long talk. A long detailed talk," she continued shivering at the memory. People who loved people may have been the luckiest people in the world, but people who had to talk about the exact details of their loving other people with their mothers were doomed to have many sleepless nights. "And no we haven't. Can I go now?"</p>

<p>Rick nodded and Jessie gratefully jumped off of the bed heading for the door.</p>

<p>"Remember you're…" Rick started to call after her.</p>

<p>"Grounded, I know," Jessie grumbled her footsteps slowing until she was actually slumping out of the door.</p>

<p>Rick sat down on the bed looking slightly dazed as soon as Jessie was out of the room. Lily sat down beside him placing a hand on his shoulder causing him to jump slightly. She'd been so quiet during the talk he'd forgotten she was there.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought both of them would end up liking girls?" Lily asked shaking her head at the thought of the odds of both of their daughters ending up being gay.</p>

<p>Rick looked over at her, his expression clearly showing that he was not in the mood to be philosophical about it.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. You'll deal with it. In fact once you get acclimated to the idea, you'll see that same-sex love is a beautiful thing," Lily commented thinking about the journey she had undertaken when she had first become aware of Grace's gayness, and how she had come to be proud of her daughter and couldn't wait until they could hold signs together and wear matching humorous T-Shirts. She had even started taping Rosie just to lend her support to the cause. "I just wish that Grace could find a nice girl like Katie," Lily continued with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Katie's a hoodlum," Rick grumbled in response, not having been paying the least bit of attention to Lily until she mentioned the girl's name.</p>

<p>"She's not a hoodlum," Lily responded rolling her eyes. Over all the times that Katie had been over at their house, Lily had managed to talk to the girl quite a bit and she was a very nice girl. She was sweet, and funny and outgoing, and as far as Lily was concerned just the kind of girl that Jessie needed.</p>

<p>"She probably does drugs," Rick, continued oblivious to Lily's presence.</p>

<p>"She doesn't do drugs," Lily responded looking over at him incredulously.</p>

<p>"What do you know?" Rick asked grumpily. "You thought Jessie was heterosexual and I had nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>At this Lily stood up and began to head to the door to go and see if Grace had gotten home yet. There was no use talking to Rick when he got like this.</p>

<p>"She probably sells drugs and that's what they were doing out so late," Rick called after her, but Lily continued out the door ignoring him.</p>
