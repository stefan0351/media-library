<!-- This Time Around \ Part Thirty-Six: A Promise Of Forever -->

<p>***The Palace; Sam's room***</p>

<p>Sam crawled under her covers and watched as Faith finished her
bedtime routine and crawled in next to her.  She was thankful that
her parents hadn't argued when she and Brooke asked if Faith and
Buffy could stay the night.  She didn't think she would be able to
make it through this night with out Faith.</p>

<p>Once under the covers Faith scooted over next to Sam, and Sam
instantly put her head on Faith chest.  Faith ran her fingers through
the silken stands of long brown hair splayed over her chest.  "I love
you."  She whispered quietly.</p>

<p>Sam sniffled and then replied, "I love you too.I'm scared."</p>

<p>Faith wrapped her arms around Sam a little tighter, and pulled her
little closer.  "I know, I was too.  When I first found out, I didn't
know what I'd do, I didn't want to die, and here was destiny handing
me an early death sentence.pissed me off."  Faith said softly, she
had never shared her true feelings on the subject, but instinctively
knew that Sam needed to hear it.  "But as I went on, I lost some
friends, gained some, and in the end, found the love of my life.  I
wouldn't be here now, in your arms, if destiny hadn't made me the
slayer."</p>

<p>Sam sighed, "well when you go and put it that way.I just don't want
to see you hurt."</p>

<p>Smiling Faith said, "I won't."</p>

<p>Sam looked up at Faith chocolate brown eyes and said softly, but
sternly  "I don't want to loose you Faith I mean it!"</p>

<p>"You won't Samantha, I'll be here, forever.promise."  Faith leaned
down and kissed her heart, her soul, her Samantha, and then snuggled
together they fell asleep. </p>
