<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 39: A Birthday to Remember -->

<p>Rebecca dreamed that she was a prisoner in the turret of a castle
		in a foreign land. She could not speak the language of the natives, and had no idea why
		she was being held, but she sensed that days had passed since she had been captured. She
		watched from the parapet as the people came and went in the courtyard below, but was too
		far away for her voice to be heard if she cried out. Her strength was ebbing from lack of
		food and water; it seemed she had been forgotten in her lonely tower. When she thought she
		could not hold on any longer, she saw a knight dressed in black ride into the courtyard on
		a golden steed. Her heart leapt with joy at the sight, as she knew this was her knight
		come to rescue her. With what little strength she had left, she called "Sir
		Knight!" and dropped her handkerchief over the parapet. The knight looked up as if he
		had heard her voice, and saw the handkerchief fluttering in the wind. He vaulted from the
		back of his horse and drawing his sword he fought his way through the castle guard. She
		could no longer see him, but she knew he was making his way toward her and that rescue was
		at hand. Even as that thought flitted through her mind, she heard the sound of swords
		clashing outside her door, and then silence. The bolt was thrown back, and the door was
		opened. The black knight stood outside the door as if awaiting her invitation to enter.
		She made a gesture to indicate he should enter, certain that he would not understand her
		language, and immediately he strode into the room. His chain mail was red with the blood
		of her captors but he was unhurt. She watched as he crossed the room to where she stood,
		but before he got there, her legs gave out and she started to crumple. In an instant the
		knight was there, his strong arms around her, gathering her up and holding her against his
		chest. Rebecca reached up and grasped the helmet that covered his head and tugged it off.
		Long black hair tumbled free, and Josie?s piercing blue eyes were fixed on her own.
		The knight bent to press her lips gently against Rebecca?s. "Oh,
		Josie?" Rebecca murmured when Josie broke off the kiss, and her heart started to
		pound?.</p>

		<p>"Yes sprite, I?m here," Josie?s voice said
		softly, but the dream knight?s lips had not moved. Rebecca?s dream self was
		still trying to figure out how the knight had accomplished that feat when Josie continued,
		"Wake up, Mary Sunshine. It?s your birthday."</p>

		<p>Rebecca tried to pull the voice into the dream, but the smell of
		something cooking contributed to the allure of the waking reality. She opened her eyes to
		see the gunslinger sitting on the side of the bed holding a tray laden down with food.
		There was a mountain of crisp bacon, fried eggs, biscuits, a cup of coffee and a glass of
		orange juice. A vase full of bright flowers stood on a corner of the tray. Rebecca?s
		mouth dropped open in surprise and she simply stared. She thought of pinching herself to
		see if she had just moved from one dream into another, when a very real Josie leaned over
		and kissed her forehead.</p>

		<p>"Breakfast in bed for the birthday girl," she said
		brightly. "Now sit up higher so I can fit this tray over your lap." Rebecca did
		as she asked and Josie put the sumptuous breakfast in front of her. Rebecca just continued
		to stare first at the food and then at Josie, and the gunslinger laughed. The facial
		expressions alone made Josie determined to surprise the pretty blonde more often.</p>

		<p>When Rebecca finally found her voice she asked incredulously,
		"You didn?t make this, did you?"</p>

		<p>"God no. You don?t think I?d do that to you on
		your birthday, do you? Charles and Horace made it."</p>

		<p>"Horace?" Rebecca asked around a mouthful of food.</p>

		<p>"Charles? brother. He got here this morning bright and
		early. We got tired of waiting for you to grace us with your presence, and I figured the
		smell of food would do the trick. Worked, too. Oh, by the way, what were you dreaming
		about when I came in? You called out my name and I thought for a moment you had seen me,
		but you were still sound asleep."</p>

		<p>Rebecca?s cheeks flushed a bright red as she remembered her
		dream about the dashing knight. "I don?t remember," she lied softly, and
		Josie raised her eyebrow and looked at her questioningly. "All right, well?I was
		locked up in a castle and you were dressed as a knight and came to rescue me. Happy
		now?"</p>

		<p>"Not as happy as that knight was, I think," she answered, causing Rebecca?s
		checks to color again. "Mmm, that must have been some dream," Josie said with a
		wicked grin.</p>

		<p>Rebecca slapped Josie playfully on the arm. "Stop it,"
		she said.</p>

		<p>"As you wish, m?lady," Josie said bowing from the
		waist. "Sorry," she said in response to the glare she got from Rebecca, who was
		too busy eating to take time for a verbal retort. Josie got up from the bed and pulled the
		curtains to allow the morning sun to stream into the room. It was then that Rebecca
		noticed the bathtub in the corner. Josie followed her eyes and said, "I know how much
		you enjoy soaking in a hot tub. I?ve already got water heating, and you can stay in
		there until you turn into a human pickle. After that?well, we have plenty of
		surprises for you after that."</p>

		<p>"But I have chores to do?" Rebecca started, and
		Josie cut her off.</p>

		<p>"Not today, you don?t. It?s your birthday, and the
		only thing you have to do today is enjoy yourself." Tears brimmed in Rebecca?s
		eyes, and her lip trembled. Josie rushed to the side of the bed and took her hand.
		"Didn?t anyone ever do anything special for you on your birthday?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca shook her head. "Pa didn?t believe in such
		foolishness, and Mother would never do anything against his wishes."</p>

		<p>"Your father is one hard-hearted son-of-a-bitch," Josie
		hissed. She promised herself again that if she ever met up with the man she would make
		sure he got to experience a taste of the agony his daughter had suffered at his hands. But
		she smiled to lighten the mood and added, "Well, we?ll just have to make it even
		more special to make up for it. How many birthdays will it be we?re making up
		for?"</p>

		<p>"Twenty."</p>

		<p>Josie?s eyes widened in surprise. "Really? I would have
		said you were maybe seventeen, eighteen. Why, you?re practically an old maid,"
		she said with a light laugh.</p>

		<p>"Josie Hunter, if this is the way you make me feel special I
		have to say it needs work," Rebecca grumbled, but she was barely hiding a smile.</p>

		<p>"Sorry, sprite. I?ll try harder. Now finish up your
		breakfast so we can get a start on the celebration." Rebecca sopped up the last of
		her egg-yolk with a bit of biscuit and popped it in her mouth. She gulped the coffee,
		which thankfully was not so hot any longer that it would burn her mouth. She chased that
		down with the rest of the orange juice, and then gave a satisfied burp.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me," she said, covering her mouth with her
		hand. "Guess that was about the best breakfast I ever had in my life."</p>

		<p>"You ain?t seen nothin? yet. I?m going to go
		get the hot water; be right back." Rebecca nodded, and climbing out of bed she began
		to unfasten the buttons of her nightgown.</p>

		<p>Josie was back and forth several times with buckets full of
		steaming water until it seemed to Rebecca that the tub was full enough. Josie then pulled
		a vial out of her pocket and she poured the contents into the water and swirled it around
		with her hand. A light lavender scent filled the air, and bubbles blossomed on top of the
		water. She inhaled the heady aroma and for a moment wished that it was she who would be
		climbing in the tub. But then she imagined the way Rebecca?s skin would feel, warm
		from the bath and lavender scented, and she was glad it was the other way around.
		"Your bath awaits you, m?lady."</p>

		<p>Rebecca had removed her nightgown, and stood with it demurely
		held in front of her body. "Turn around," she said softly, and Josie did. A
		light splash told the gunslinger that Rebecca was in the bath, and she turned back to see
		just her head and shoulders above the water. "Perfect," Rebecca said with a
		sigh. "Oh Josie, thank you. This feels marvelous."</p>

		<p>"I?m glad you?re enjoying it. I?ve got a few
		more things I need to take care of, so you just sing out when you need some more hot
		water, or if you want me to wash your back." Reluctantly she pulled her eyes away
		from the vision floating in the water and started for the door. She would have loved to
		stay and just watch her bathe, but she knew it would embarrass Rebecca.</p>

		<p>Josie was helping the two brothers drape colorful ribbon on the
		walls just beneath the ceiling when she heard Rebecca call out for her. "Be back
		shortly, boys," she said with a smile. Since neither of them could reach as high as
		she could, she suggested they go pick some more flowers until she was able to continue
		with the ribbon. They happily agreed, and the two men darted out the door like schoolboys
		when recess is called.</p>

		<p>Josie knocked lightly on the bedroom door, and Rebecca said
		"Enter." When she walked in Rebecca opened her eyes and looked up at her; she
		had been nearly dozing in the warm water. "Could you bring me more hot water, please?
		It?s starting to cool off."</p>

		<p>"Your wish is my command," she replied with a smile.
		"But I?ll need to bail out some of this water first so there will be room."
		She picked up a bucket and dipped it in the tub and then did the same with the second
		bucket. The water level had dropped so that it was not quite covering Rebecca?s
		breasts, and Josie?s eyes were drawn to the creamy orbs. Josie?s sharp intake of
		breath made Rebecca notice what she was looking at, and she almost responded by covering
		her chest with her washcloth. But sometime between their conversation the previous night
		and that morning when she stepped in the tub something had finally fallen into place in
		her mind. And she realized that she wanted Josie to look at her and to desire her, in the
		same way that she desired Josie. Starting now, she thought to herself, no more covering
		up, no more undressing in the dark.</p>

		<p>"And when you come back with the water, I?d love it if
		you?d wash my back," she said blushing just a little in spite of her new resolve
		to stop hiding herself from Josie. A lifetime of modesty was not easily overcome.</p>

		<p>"Water?s on the stove. I?ll be back in a few
		minutes." Josie retreated with the buckets and true to her word was back within five
		minutes with two steaming buckets of water. She carefully spread each bucket full evenly
		in the water to avoid burning Rebecca, and then took the washcloth from her hands and
		knelt behind the tub. "Lean forward a little," she said softly, and Rebecca
		complied, wrapping her arms around her knees. Josie soaped the cloth with the sweet
		smelling French soap she had Horace buy for her in town along with the bubble bath and a
		few other surprises Rebecca had not yet seen. She rubbed the cloth gently over the planes
		of Rebecca?s back and shoulders, resisting the impulse to reach around and caress her
		breasts.</p>

		<p>"You can scrub harder than that," Rebecca said, turning
		so that Josie could see her profile, "I?m not made of glass." Josie
		chuckled. She really was treating Rebecca as if she were a priceless porcelain figurine,
		but now she bore down a bit harder with the cloth. "Ohhhh, that feels so good,"
		Rebecca said with a sigh. "I could stay here all day."</p>

		<p>"Ah, but then you?d miss all the other surprises we
		have for your birthday."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Josie, this is too much already?I feel like a
		pampered princess."</p>

		<p>"There?s no such thing as too much; not on your
		birthday. Now, why don?t you get up on your knees so I can reach the lower part of
		your back?" Rebecca hesitated only a moment before shifting around in the tub to get
		her knees under her and rising up. Her hips were completely out of the water, as well as
		the rounded globes of her behind. Josie?s breath caught in her throat and she
		swallowed hard several times before she reached out to continue washing her beautiful
		friend. She ran the cloth over her hips and down both sides, and then over the soft
		mounds. Rebecca gasped slightly when the cloth parted the smooth cheeks. "Is this all
		right? Should I stop?" Josie asked in a husky voice.</p>

		<p>"It?s?fine. No, please don?t stop."
		Josie didn?t fail to notice the expectant quiver in Rebecca?s voice. She resumed
		her ministrations, paying special attention to the fleshy mounds. When it seemed that she
		must go further or go mad she finally stopped and took a step back from the tub.</p>

		<p>"Would you like me to wash your hair for you?"</p>

		<p>"I?uh?yes," Rebecca answered, sinking back
		into the concealing bubbles. She tilted her head back as far as she could without totally
		immersing herself and then sat up. Josie remembered Rebecca?s fear of putting her
		head underwater and determined to be especially careful this time. She worked the French
		soap into a lather with her hands and then applied it to the golden tresses. She kneaded
		her scalp with her strong fingers, and watched as Rebecca?s eyes fluttered shut.
		Josie wanted to kiss her eyelids, her nose, her lips. Never in her life had she so desired
		anything as much as she desired this woman. The love she felt for Genie seemed almost
		sisterly by comparison, and she would never have believed that was possible.</p>

		<p>"We need to rinse you off now," Josie said, and Rebecca
		nodded without opening her eyes. "I?m going to tip your head back and rinse off
		most of it in the tub. Then I?ll get some fresh water to finish with. Ready?"
		Rebecca nodded again, and Josie lowered her head until just her face was out of the water.
		She rinsed as best she could and then sat her up in the tub. "OK, relax a minute.
		I?ll be right back." Rebecca watched the tall woman walk out of the room, and
		the moment the door was closed she expelled the breath she did not realize she had been
		holding.</p>

		<p>"Oh, God," she said through clenched teeth.
		"Josie, what you do to me?" she murmured just as Josie came back in the
		room.</p>

		<p>"What was that? Did you want something?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. No. Yes?but later." Josie smiled and raised
		her eyebrow in a way that Rebecca found completely disarming. The little blonde blushed,
		and Josie found herself thinking she would never get through this day without making love
		with her.</p>

		<p>"Stand up now so I can pour this water over you."
		Rebecca did as she asked, fighting her natural impulse to shield her private parts from
		view. She could tell by the look on Josie?s face that the tall woman was thoroughly
		enjoying the display of flesh before her. She stood for several moments until her wet skin
		began to shiver in the morning chill.</p>

		<p>"Uh, Josie. I?m freezing," she said through
		chattering teeth.</p>

		<p>"Oh, baby I?m sorry," Josie said as she snapped
		out of her reverie. "Shut your eyes," she ordered, and as soon as Rebecca did,
		she poured one bucket of warm water over her. "One more?don?t move,"
		she added as she upended the second bucket over her head, making sure all the soap was
		gone from her hair. "OK, I?m getting the towel now. You can open your
		eyes." Josie fetched the towel from the washstand and wrapped it around the slender
		body, rubbing against the towel to help dry her. "Let me help you out of the
		tub," she said, putting one hand behind her shoulders and the other against the back
		of her thighs and effortlessly scooping her out of the tub. She stood for a moment with
		Rebecca in her arms, just breathing in the exotic scent of her, then reluctantly she set
		her on her feet. "I almost forgot?I brought another towel for your hair."
		She fetched the second towel and wrapped it around the golden hair, twisting it up on top
		of Rebecca?s head. The smaller woman was completely amazed; the extravagance of two
		towels for one bath was something she had never heard of.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Josie. You?re just?the sweetest person
		I?ve ever known."</p>

		<p>"And so are you," Josie said sincerely. "I?m
		going to go help Charles and Horace finish up out there and let you get dressed.
		There?s something in the dresser for you to put on. Come on out when you?re
		ready." She kissed Rebecca lightly on the lips and turned and strode from the room.</p>

		<p>When Josie had gone, Rebecca crossed to the dresser and opened
		the door. Hanging inside was a gingham dress the color of the summer sky with white
		tatting around the collar and sleeves. The buttons looked like pearls, and a blue silk
		scarf peeked out of a pocket above the left breast. White shoes that looked like they were
		made of soft kidskin sat in the bottom of the closet. Rebecca?s mouth dropped open as
		she looked at these beautiful items, and tears began to course down her cheeks. "Oh
		Josie?" she murmured as she gulped down her tears.</p>

		<p>Josie inspected the room again just to make sure everything met
		with her approval. The walls were gaily draped in multi-colored ribbons and every
		available surface space had a vase or bowl full of flowers. In the center of the dining
		table was a cake, slightly off center from the trip from town, but Josie had put it back
		together so that it looked almost as good as new. It was covered with white butter
		frosting and decorated with pink flowers and green vines. "Happy Birthday
		Rebecca" was written in pink frosting across it. Horace had come through like a
		champ; he had fetched everything she had asked for, and a little extra besides. It had not
		occurred to her to serve Rebecca breakfast in bed until Horace produced a rasher of fresh
		bacon and told her he could whip up a mean biscuit.</p>

		<p>"Calm down, gal," Charles admonished her.
		"You?re gonna wear a hole in my floor with all your pacin?. She?ll be
		out directly."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I know, I just?."</p>

		<p>"Sit," he said sharply, cutting her off in mid
		sentence. So shocked was she to be given an order from him that she simply sat. "Deal
		her in," he said to his brother who was shuffling the cards for a new hand of poker.
		She picked up the cards and arranged them without truly seeing what they were, and almost
		threw away a natural straight.</p>

		<p>"How many do you want," Horace asked.</p>

		<p>"I?ll play these." At that moment the bedroom door
		opened, and Rebecca emerged, her eyes taking in the transformation the room had undergone
		and growing wider by the second. She was a vision in the blue dress and all three people
		at the table gaped at her, none more than Josie. Embarrassed to be the object of so much
		attention, she shyly glanced toward the floor.</p>

		<p>Josie tossed in her hand of cards and rose to greet her. Both men
		stood up also, as gentlemen should when a lady enters a room. Josie walked to her and took
		both of her hands in her own, and leaning forward she placed a kiss on each cheek. She
		paused for a moment before she straightened up and whispered in her ear, "You are
		breathtakingly beautiful, Rebecca. I hope you won?t mind if I stare at you all
		day."</p>

		<p>"Josie I?I don?t know what to say?."</p>

		<p>"Say that you love me," Josie whispered so softly that
		only Rebecca could hear.</p>

		<p>"I love you," she whispered back. Josie smiled from ear
		to ear and took Rebecca?s hand to present her to Horace.</p>

		<p>"Horace, this is my dearest friend, Rebecca?"</p>

		<p>Horace took Rebecca?s hand in his and lightly kissed it.
		"Purely pleasured to meetcha, little gal. To hear these two talk, I was expecting to
		see wings and a halo on you. But you look plumb pretty even without ?em. Oh, and
		happy birthday," he added almost as an afterthought.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Horace," she said dropping a little curtsy.
		"I heard so much about you from Charles, I felt like I knew you already."</p>

		<p>"Don?t be hoggin? the pretty gal?s all to
		yourself, you old fool," Charles said jokingly as he elbowed past Horace to take
		Rebecca?s hand and kiss it as well. Rebecca laughed as the two old men took
		good-natured pot shots at each other. She also noticed that Charles was wearing his
		Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes, and had his hair neatly combed instead of flying off in all
		directions as usual.</p>

		<p>"You?re pretty spruced up yourself, Charles. You could
		sure turn a girl?s head."</p>

		<p>"Ain?t I just? Your big tall friend over there
		wouldn?t have it but that we all had to get dressed up like the President hisself was
		coming to call." He winked at Josie, and Rebecca knew that it was at least as much
		his idea as hers. Clearly both brothers were enjoying having a woman to fuss over again.
		They pulled out a chair for her and had her sit at the table. It was then that she noticed
		the cake with her name on it, and her eyes widened in surprise and her mouth opened in a
		big "O."</p>

		<p>"Hurry up and give her your?you know," Josie said
		with a nod in the direction of the kitchen where Charles and Horace had stashed their
		gifts for her. "I want to see her open them, and I need to get cleaned up
		myself."</p>

		<p>"Keep your drawers on," Charles muttered, but he did
		walk briskly to the kitchen and return a few moments later with two bundles wrapped in
		brown paper. "Sorry I didn?t have no fancy wrappin? paper, but I guess
		it?s what?s inside that counts." He laid the two bundles in front of the
		astounded woman, who simply sat and stared at them. "Well, open ?em up,
		f?gosh sakes. They ain?t gonna open themselves. This one first; it?s from
		me."</p>

		<p>Rebecca carefully peeled back the layer of brown paper on the
		first package, and gasped in surprise when she saw "Little Women", by Louisa May
		Alcott. "Oh, Charles! I love it! I?ve wanted to read this book ever since I saw
		it in the mercantile in Chancetown!" She threw her arms around his neck and hugged
		him until his face turned bright red from embarrassment.</p>

		<p>"Open the other one," Horace said brightly. Rebecca
		could scarcely believe what was happening to her that morning, and all because it was the
		anniversary of her birth. She untied the string holding the paper on the other package to
		reveal a small wooden box with an intricate design carved in the top. Imbedded between the
		designs were brightly colored pieces of mother-of-pearl. She lifted the lid on the box,
		and within she saw gears and springs. Even as she looked, the gears started to turn and
		she heard the strains of "Beautiful Dreamer" coming from the box.</p>

		<p>"Horace, I?this is so beautiful. How can I thank you?
		I?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, don?t thank me. All I did was fetch it. Josie is
		the one that asked me to pick it up. This is from me." Horace reached into his pocket
		and pulled out a flat parcel and placed it in her hand. Rebecca unwrapped it without
		taking her eyes off Josie. It contained a handkerchief with an "R" daintily
		embroidered in one corner. The edges were scalloped with the same tatting that decorated
		the dress; clearly both items came from the same seamstress.</p>

		<p>Rebecca hugged Horace and kissed him on the cheek. "This is
		beautiful also. You have excellent taste in handkerchiefs as well as music boxes."
		Horace beamed at her and puffed out his chest like a little banty rooster. Rebecca tucked
		the handkerchief in her pocket and stood up. She walked to where Josie leaned against the
		bedroom doorjamb her arms crossed over her chest, and came to a stop in front of her. A
		sheen of moisture glistened in Rebecca?s eyes as she stood on tiptoe and placed a
		kiss on Josie?s lips. The gunslinger?s breath caught in her throat, and she felt
		a jolt that reached to the very core of her. "How did you?" Rebecca began,
		but Josie stopped her with a finger to her lips.</p>

		<p>"I?ll tell you everything later. Right now, just enjoy.
		Read your new book, or play games with the old codgers?"</p>

		<p>"Hey, I heard that! Old codgers, indeed," Horace
		grumbled.</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, and remember, Horace?s hearing is much better
		than Charles?." She smiled at Charles, who stuck out his tongue at her.
		"I?m going to go clean up a bit myself. Be back soon. And no work ?
		don?t you lift a finger today, you understand me? We?ll take care of
		everything."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma?am," Rebecca said, giving her a little
		salute. She walked back to the table with a huge grin on her face. "Get out the beans
		and deal the cards, boys. We?re playing poker!"</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Almost an hour later the door to the bedroom opened and Josie
		emerged. The trio at the table heard her splashing and even singing snatches from songs
		now and then, but they were so wrapped up in their playing they failed to notice how much
		time had passed. Rebecca looked up when the door opened, and did a double take when she
		saw the beautiful woman standing there. Her cards and the other people in the room
		forgotten, Rebecca stared openly at Josie. This was the first time she had seen her in
		anything but her longjohns or her customary black shirt and pants. She wore a blue satin
		looking shirt with the top several snaps unfastened to reveal more cleavage than would be
		considered proper. Instead of her bandanna, she had a white silk scarf tied around her
		neck. Her pants were blue denim, tucked into her cleaned and polished boots. She wore her
		hair in a long braid down her back with a thong of leather braided into it. A hawk feather
		was attached to the leather thong and hung beside her right ear. Rebecca had never seen
		anyone more stunning. Her heart was hammering in her chest, and she found that she was
		holding her breath. She let it out in a rush.</p>

		<p>"You clean up real good for a roofer," Charles said
		appreciatively. Horace nodded vigorously in agreement.</p>

		<p>Josie laughed. "Thanks, old man. You sure know how to
		disguise a complement. And you?re awfully quiet there, Rebecca. What do you think?
		The duds suit me?"</p>

		<p>"I-I?oh," she swallowed and took a deep breath and
		started again. "My God Josie, you-you take my breath away."</p>

		<p>"Well, Horace I?d say you did pretty damned well with
		what little I gave you to work with." She grasped his hand and shook it vigorously,
		and then pulled him into her arms and gave him a solid hug. "Thank you?both of
		you, for making Rebecca?s birthday so special. We?ll never forget this
		day."</p>

		<p>"Never," Rebecca agreed.</p>

		<p>"Now if you boys can do without this pretty little gal for a
		while, I?d like to take her for a walk. Would you do me the honor, Rebecca?" She
		bowed and held out her hand, and Rebecca placed hers in it and allowed Josie to pull her
		to her feet.</p>

		<p>"I?d be delighted," she said sincerely.</p>

		<p>"Be back by noon time, ladies. Horace has a real special
		meal planned."</p>

		<p>"We wouldn?t miss it," Josie said breezily as they
		sailed out the door. It was a beautiful fall morning, the colors on the trees a hundred
		shades of red and orange and gold. Soon they would be dropping, but at that moment they
		were surrounded by a riot of fall colors. Hand in hand they walked past the flower garden,
		now nearly bare both from the shortening days and from the regular picking that had been
		going on for the past week. Josie led Rebecca into the work shed where she had been
		toiling on the totem, and sat her down on a stool. "Close your eyes," she said,
		and Rebecca did ask she asked. "Now hold out your hands." When she did, Josie
		placed an object in her hands she could not identify by touch. "Open your eyes."</p>

		<p>The object she held was a totem, but it was unlike any she had
		seen in books. Just over a foot long and about two inches around, at the base stood a
		bear, and on its shoulders was a wolf. On the back of the wolf stood two women. They were
		entwined so that you could not readily see where one began and the other left off. One was
		considerably taller, her long hair flowing over her shoulders. The smaller one nestled
		against the tall one, but she did not appear to be diminutive despite her smaller size.
		Atop the totem was a phoenix, its wings spread to enclose the two women, keeping them
		safe. The piece was stained a rich red-brown, and was sanded as smooth as glass. Rebecca
		did not realize she was crying until a tear splashed on the totem and brought her back to
		the moment. She put her arms around Josie?s neck still clutching the totem tightly in
		her hand, and for several moments she stayed that way, unable to speak, tears coursing
		down her cheeks.</p>

		<p>"I love you," Josie whispered as she lowered her head
		and buried her face in the warm fragrance of Rebecca?s hair.</p>

		<p>"And I love you?with all of my being." She pulled
		away from Josie so that she could look into her face, cradling the totem against her
		chest. "And this is the most beautiful thing anybody has ever done for me. I will
		cherish it for as long as I live." She raised up on her tiptoes and touched her lips
		lightly to Josie?s, and felt an unmistakable quiver in the lips that returned her
		soft kiss.</p>

		<p>"Do you? I was afraid to hope?"</p>

		<p>"So was I. If only we had talked like this long ago."</p>

		<p>Josie shrugged. "Things happen when they?re meant to.
		We might have said the wrong things and ruined whatever chance we had." She wrapped
		her arms around Rebecca?s waist and pulled the smaller woman close to her, their
		bodies tingling at each point of contact. "I want to make love with you," Josie
		said huskily. "I want to touch and taste you, to memorize every inch of you with my
		eyes."</p>

		<p>Rebecca?s breath caught in her throat and an intense stab of
		desire that pierced her center and radiated outward rocked her, causing her knees to
		threaten to buckle. She pressed her body even closer to Josie?s and allowed the
		taller woman to hold her up, delighting in the feel of her warm flesh even through the
		layers of clothes that separated them. "I hope I don?t?disappoint
		you," she said softly, her lips only a breath removed from the tantalizing V of
		Josie?s shirt. When Josie inhaled Rebecca felt the softness of her breast touch her
		lips and cheek, and she kissed the smooth flesh. She knew she had never felt anything more
		soft and at the same time exciting.</p>

		<p>"Ohhh," Josie sighed, burying her fingers in the golden
		tresses and tilting Rebecca?s head back until she was looking into her eyes.
		"You couldn?t possibly disappoint me. The mere touch of your lips is enough to
		make me lightheaded. Anything more than that will be pure heaven."</p>

		<p>Emboldened by those words, Rebecca put her hand on the back of
		Josie?s head and brought Josie?s lips down to where she could reach without
		standing on her toes. She kissed the gunslinger more passionately than she had the first
		time, and felt Josie?s lips parting slightly. Rebecca had never participated in such
		a kiss and was uncertain what to do next. The gunslinger, sensing her hesitation, took the
		lead and played her tongue along Rebecca?s lips until they parted, which Josie took
		as an invitation to explore. Rebecca?s tongue met her own, shyly at first and then
		more forcefully. Josie clasped the smaller woman?s body tightly to her own, and felt
		Rebecca?s moan as a tremble against her lips.</p>

		<p>Josie wanted nothing more than to tear the clothes from
		Rebecca?s body and make love to her then and there, but common sense told her they
		were in a dirty work shed in the middle of a day of celebration. Not only did she not want
		their first time to be in such surroundings, but also there was the possibility that the
		brothers would come looking for them if they were gone too long, and she did not want to
		be interrupted. When they made love for the first time it had to be perfect?or as
		close to perfect as Josie had the power to make it. She broke off the kiss and pulled back
		slightly, reluctant to completely release the warm, soft body in her arms. "We have
		to stop?" Rebecca?s look of disappointment pierced her and she paused
		momentarily, then continued, "Oh, please don?t look at me like that. You must
		know that I am dying inside from wanting you. It?s just?this isn?t the time
		or the place. Later tonight in our room I promise we?ll make up for lost time."
		She kissed her again lightly on the lips and whispered into her ear, "It?ll be
		worth waiting for?I guarantee it."</p>

		<p>The sound of Josie?s honeyed voice and the promise it
		carried made Rebecca weak. Never had she felt such emotional highs and physical
		stimulation. Her mind was on overload trying to sort all the new feelings. She knew only
		one thing with certainty; she had never wanted anything in her life as badly as she wanted
		Josie. Before reluctantly pulling her body away from Josie?s, Rebecca kissed her
		back, and briefly darted her tongue inside the outlaw?s mouth, and then quickly
		backed away. Josie groaned when Rebecca said softly, "That?s so you don?t
		forget your promise." Hand in hand they emerged into the bright sunlight and returned
		to the house where their friends waited.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca sat in Charles? most comfortable chair. Her feet
		rested on a pillow that was placed on a stool. She was not allowed to do any work at all,
		but was told to sit and relax and read her book. The three other inhabitants of the house
		revolved around her as if she were the sun, her slightest fancy answered by one of the
		three without hesitation. Horace cooked and Josie and Charles cleaned up, and any offer to
		help from Rebecca was stifled with a menacing look. When they sat down to supper, the two
		women barely picked at the generous spread of food in front of them, so preoccupied were
		they with thoughts of what the end of the day would hold. Every time their eyes would meet
		across the table, they would quickly lower their gaze, certain that the men would be able
		to tell what was in their minds from the looks on their faces.</p>

		<p>When the meal was finally finished and the dishes washed and put
		away, the last of Rebecca?s surprises was presented to her. Charles and Horace
		rummaged in a closet and brought out a fiddle and an accordion, and with Rebecca once
		again deposited in Charles? favorite chair, the two men began to play. Josie sat on
		the arm of the chair, her thigh touching Rebecca?s arm, the graceful curve of her hip
		pressed against Rebecca?s shoulder. Rebecca was thrilled by the touch and delighted
		by the music, unable to decide what gave her greater pleasure. The old men played a lot of
		old songs that neither of the women knew by heart, but when a familiar melody started they
		both sang along at the top of their lungs. Rebecca had never heard Josie sing before, and
		her rich alto voice was like warm honey pouring over Rebecca, causing her to tingle all
		over.</p>

		<p>"This here?s dancin? music," Charles said as
		they began to play a lively tune. "You gals get on up and dance; shame to waste the
		music just because there ain?t no fellers around."</p>

		<p>Josie glanced down at Rebecca, who shook her head and shrugged.
		"I?never learned to dance," she admitted ruefully.</p>

		<p>"Doesn?t matter. I?ll teach you," Josie said
		standing up and holding out her hand for Rebecca. The younger woman shook her head again,
		but when Josie gave her an imploring look, she put her hand in Josie?s and allowed
		herself to be pulled to her feet. Josie took Rebecca?s left hand in hers and placed
		her left hand in the small of Rebecca?s back. "Put your other hand on my
		shoulder," she instructed, and Rebecca did as she asked. "Now when I press on
		your back like this," she demonstrated, "It means I?m going to turn you,
		like so." She executed a neat half turn, and Rebecca managed to stay with her.
		"Good. Now when I do this," and she pressed a different way on Rebecca?s
		back, "It means I am going to lead off with my right foot, so you go back or forward
		with your left foot depending on which way I?m turning you. Got that?"</p>

		<p>"No," Rebecca said with a laugh. "But I?ll
		try to keep up."</p>

		<p>"OK, here we go. One, two, three." The next thing
		Rebecca knew, they were whirling around the room, and to her utter amazement, she was able
		to follow the subtle motions Josie made with a minimum of toe stomping. By the end of the
		song she was following almost flawlessly, and Josie began to throw in a few new moves such
		as dipping Rebecca almost to the floor and then pulling her back into her arms. They were
		both breathless when the song ended, not entirely due to the exertion of the dance.
		Charles and Horace launched into a song with a similar beat, and without even catching
		their breath the women were whirling around the floor again, smiles wreathing their faces.</p>

		<p>When that song ended, Josie gave Charles a little nod, and
		Charles tapped Horace with his bow. They began playing a slow ballad that Rebecca was not
		familiar with, and as Josie pulled her closer to her body she whispered in her ear,
		"I hope you like this song. I heard it somewhere along the line, and it makes me
		think of you." And as she slowly moved Rebecca around the room in time to the music
		she began to sing.</p>

		<p>Believe me if all those endearing young charms</p>

		<p>Which I gaze on so fondly today</p>

		<p>Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms</p>

		<p>Like fairy gifts fading away</p>

		<p>Thou would still be adored</p>

		<p>As this moment thou art</p>

		<p>Let thy loveliness fade as it will</p>

		<p>And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart</p>

		<p>Will entwine itself verdantly still.</p>

		<p>It is not while beauty and youth are thine own</p>

		<p>And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear</p>

		<p>That the fervor and faith of a soul shall be known</p>

		<p>To which time has but made thee more dear</p>

		<p>For the heart that has truly loved never forgets</p>

		<p>But as truly loves on to the close</p>

		<p>As the sunflower turns on her God when He sets</p>

		<p>The same look that she gave when He rose.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>As the music came to an end and Josie?s voice grew silent,
		the two women came to a stop in the middle of the room. Josie?s arms still held
		Rebecca tightly, for which the smaller woman was grateful, as she was not certain she
		could trust her legs to hold her up without assistance. She looked up at Josie and the
		sheen of tears that sparkled in her eyes tugged at the gunslinger?s heart. Not
		trusting herself to speak, nor wishing to be overheard by the brothers, Rebecca mouthed
		the words "I love you," and then lightly touched her lips to Josie?s cheek.</p>

		<p>"And I love you," Josie whispered back, and then added
		conspiratorially, "Why don?t we excuse ourselves from this party?" She
		didn?t need to add that the unfinished business of that afternoon had been on her
		mind so much that day that she was not certain how she was able to get through the hours
		without dragging the little blonde away and ravishing her. That message was conveyed quite
		clearly in the ardent glow in her eyes. Rebecca nodded shyly and lowered her gaze; her
		cheeks suffused with a bright pink that left no misunderstanding as to her own desires.</p>

		<p>Charles and Horace had already launched themselves into another
		spirited song, and hadn?t even noticed that the women did not start to dance. Josie
		waved to catch Charles? eye and he lifted his bow from the old fiddle and once again
		tapped his brother to get his attention. Josie smiled as she walked to where they sat, and
		then she thought perhaps a yawn might be in order so she stretched and yawned as she said,
		"We?re pretty tuckered out after all the excitement today. Think we?re
		going to turn in early."</p>

		<p>"Shucks. We was just gettin? warmed up. Sure you
		can?t do a few more jigs?"</p>

		<p>Taking her cue from the gunslinger, Rebecca scrubbed at her eyes
		with her knuckles and tried her best to yawn. "You boys wore us out with all that
		dancing. I can hardly keep my eyes open."</p>

		<p>"Well?we?d sure like to keep playing, unless you
		ladies think the noise will keep you awake," Horace said.</p>

		<p>"We could go out on the porch and play," Charles added.
		"Shouldn?t be too loud from out there."</p>

		<p>"Oh, there?s no need to?" Rebecca began, and
		Josie cut her off quickly.</p>

		<p>"Out on the porch. That?d be good," she said
		emphatically. Rebecca looked at her quizzically, and Josie tried her best to convey that
		Rebecca should simply trust her, she knew what she was doing.</p>

		<p>"Maybe that would be best. Josie hates to miss her
		sleep."</p>

		<p>"Right, then," Charles said rising from his chair and
		tapping his brother on the shoulder. "Come on, old fool. Let?s us leave these
		beautiful ladies to their selves." The old men shuffled out, closing the door quietly
		behind them. A moment later the strains of "Tenting on the Old Camp Ground"
		wafted through the window. Satisfied that they would be out there for some time and that
		the music would mask any unusual sounds that might come from their room, Josie took
		Rebecca by the elbow and together they walked toward their future.</p>
		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie struck a match and lit the wicks on the candles on the
		bedside table and wash stand. She turned around to find Rebecca standing by the bureau,
		her hands exploring the smooth contours of the totem she had placed there earlier in the
		day. The gunslinger walked up behind her and with a gentle nudge of her hands turned
		Rebecca around to face her, their bodies scant inches apart. With a slowness that was
		agonizing to both of them, she pulled the young woman's hips to her, the contact shocking
		each of them with its intensity. No words were spoken as the gunslinger lowered her mouth
		closer and closer to Rebecca's lips. They played a dance with each other over and over,
		lips moving forward, then pulling back in hesitancy.</p>

		<p>"I love you so much," the gunslinger whispered with a
		tremble in her voice. "God, I?m shaking like a leaf." The blood of desire
		rose within them,</p>

		<p>pushing their fears back bit by bit until at last there was no
		more doubt. They kissed again; their bodies pressed so closely together that each could
		feel the others heartbeat. Josie's tongue demanded entry to Rebecca?s mouth as her
		grip around the young woman tightened. Rebecca gave up trying to focus and closed her eyes
		as the kiss deepened to a level never before experienced by the young woman. Only the
		outlaw's grip on her waist kept her up on her shaky legs. Each felt a pounding deep in her
		loins when they finally separated to catch their breath. Blue eyes locked with green as
		unspoken words were exchanged.</p>

		<p>Rebecca placed her hands on top of the stronger ones and pulled
		them</p>

		<p>gently away from her waist. Maintaining eye contact, she knelt in
		front of</p>

		<p>Josie. She let go of the outlaw's hands and with courage she
		didn?t even know she possessed, she ran her hands up and down the length of the
		gunslinger's legs, following the cut of her britches. Josie groaned and placed her hands
		on Rebecca's shoulders when she felt the shy hands graze the inside of her thighs. Leaning
		in, the young woman nuzzled against Josie's right thigh while her hands were busy
		unbuckling Josie?s leather belt. Rebecca leaned back and looked up at the outlaw in
		anticipation. A seductive smile played across Josie's lips as her hands moved to her belt.
		</p>

		<p>"Is this what you want?" The gunslinger teased gently
		as she fingered the</p>

		<p>buckle, slowly pushing the leather through. Rebecca swallowed and
		nodded mutely, her mouth suddenly dry. Both women were completely focused on Josie's hands
		as they slowly removed the belt, letting it drop to the floor. There would be no rushing
		tonight, no sudden moves. This would be a night of softness and slowness, the taking and
		giving of one's soul to another and receiving one in return. Josie reached for the button
		of her britches only to have smaller hands grasp her own.</p>

		<p>"I'll do it." Rebecca's voice was barely a whisper as
		her hands moved in</p>

		<p>and took over the task. Her hands followed the path of the
		britches as they made their way down the gunslinger's legs. Desire feeding strength into
		her legs, she rose to capture Josie's mouth with her own. Tongues danced and explored as
		they exchanged soft sighs of pleasure at the long awaited act. Josie's hands grasped at
		the young woman's dress, popping several buttons in her quest to pull her closer.</p>

		<p>The outlaw blazed a trail of kisses up Rebecca's jaw line before
		stopping</p>

		<p>just below the earlobe. "Rebecca..." Her warm breath
		tickled and excited as her hands moved between them to undo the remaining buttons on the
		dress. Josie's mouth moved down to capture her soft throat, marking it as her own. Rebecca
		helplessly groaned and leaned into her, unable to focus on anything except Josie?s
		mouth on her throat, exciting her in a way she had never dreamed possible.</p>

		<p>Josie's mouth explored the newly revealed flesh as she lowered
		herself,</p>

		<p>undoing one button after another until the dress was open,
		loosely covering</p>

		<p>the young woman's breasts. Unable to take the anticipation,
		Rebecca removed her dress and camisole, exposing herself to the gunslinger's hungry gaze.
		Josie's mouth watered as her blue eyes drank in the delicious sight. The cool autumn night
		and the blonde's own passions caused her nipples to contract and point in a most inviting
		way. The gunslinger pressed her lips against Rebecca?s firm abdomen, feeling her love
		quivering against her.</p>

		<p>"Josie?please." The sound of womanly desire burst
		forth for the first time</p>

		<p>from her lips. She buried her fingers into the raven hair and
		guided her up for a kiss that left them both breathless and weak-kneed. Josie reached
		behind and cupped Rebecca's firm rear while the young woman was busy trying to separate
		the gunslinger from her shirt and vest.</p>

		<p>Josie lifted her into her arms and carried her over to the bed,
		her left</p>

		<p>nipple hardening at the feel of the young woman's skin against
		it. She laid Rebecca down and placed herself half over, half next to her, their breasts
		touching. She pulled the small shoes off the young woman, letting them fall to the floor
		with the rest of the clothes. Pulling Rebecca back into her arms, Josie rolled until she
		was on her back, the pleasurable weight of her blonde lover on top. They kissed deeply,
		their tongues urging each other on as both women struggled to remove Rebecca's under
		drawers without breaking lip contact. As she moved her hips and Josie pushed down on the
		material, inch by inch of Rebecca's creamy flesh was revealed. Only when the outlaw
		couldn't reach down any further did they finally break their kiss, allowing her to finish
		pulling off the last of Rebecca's clothes. The orange candlelight reflected off the
		glistening moisture of her soft blonde curls as Josie rolled her onto her back. A few
		quick movements and both women were completely naked against each other.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca?" The gunslinger's lips were inches away.
		"I want you." She gave</p>

		<p>her slow gentle kisses that made the young woman melt. A low moan
		escaped the blonde as she responded to the dizzying kisses. Josie pressed against her,
		sliding her right leg between Rebecca's. She made no attempt to go further, seeming
		content with the kisses. After what seemed an eternity of searching and exploring the
		younger woman's mouth, she lifted her head. "Rebecca?" She brought her
		trembling hand up to stroke her cheek. Rebecca reached out and caught Josie's hand.
		Slowly, she brought it down to her left breast. The gunslinger moaned softly and caressed
		the soft mound, deliberately avoiding the nipple.</p>

		<p>Josie's voice was ragged as she brought her fingertips up to
		explore the</p>

		<p>softness of Rebecca's lips. "For so long...I've wanted this
		for so long." The words were lost in a sea of kisses. Josie's hand went to the breast
		it had touched earlier, this time with more authority. She squeezed gently, rubbing her
		thumb across the pebbly flesh. She felt Rebecca's nipple hardening beneath her touch. Her
		kisses became more urgent, demanding. She broke the kiss and gazed down at the breasts
		exposed to her. The hungry look in her eyes opened a flood between Rebecca's legs. With
		great gentleness, the gunslinger lay on top of her, using her elbows to help support her
		weight. Like a hungry kitten, Josie licked and sucked, causing Rebecca to moan and murmur
		in pleasure. Instinctually, the young woman put her fingers in the raven hair and pressed
		Josie's head down. The gunslinger responded by nibbling and biting her sensitive tit,
		causing Rebecca to cry out and grind her pelvis against Josie's leg.
		"Oh?Josie?" Rebecca knew this was what she wanted, what she had waited
		so</p>

		<p>long for. She needed this, needed Josie to make her a total
		woman. The activity on her nipple became more forceful in response to her increasing
		moans.</p>

		<p>Josie could feel the passion building. She turned her attention
		to the</p>

		<p>right breast for a few moments, lavishing it with the same
		treatment the other received, planting several soft kisses on it before continuing
		downward. She ran her tongue lightly over Rebecca's stomach, drawing more moans from the
		writhing blonde before returning to the creamy mounds of flesh.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Rebecca?" Josie's voice was rough. "Tell
		me?tell me what you want." She</p>

		<p>suckled the other breast while her thigh continued to rub against
		damp curls. Josie felt the hot moisture and knew that this was what her young love needed.
		She pressed firmly against Rebecca's mound, and was rewarded with another moan from the
		younger woman. Josie blazed a trail down Rebecca's body with her tongue, stopping to run
		the tip around an incredibly sensitive bellybutton before reaching the curly hair that
		covered the young woman's sex. Josie nuzzled the soft curls, relishing the feeling. The
		musky scent of her filled the gunslinger's nostrils as she slipped her tongue between the
		folds and licked up the juices that had formed. The sweet, salty taste made her hunger for
		more, but Josie didn't want to rush this. She wanted Rebecca, she wanted her bad, and
		tonight she would have her. Tonight Josie wanted to take this adored woman to new heights.
		She continued to lick the juices with her tongue, careful not to</p>

		<p>touch the swollen bundle of nerves. Rebecca's squirming
		increased.</p>

		<p>"Josie?please?I want you?I want to feel
		you?oh God please..." Rebecca said</p>

		<p>desperately as she again arched her hips toward Josie. The young
		woman was in ecstasy. She had never felt this sensation before, never wanted to give
		herself completely to anyone. But, oh how she wanted this woman. She wanted everything her
		raven-haired lover could give. "I need to feel you?inside me," she finally
		said, her green eyes locking with the blue of her friend, her mentor, and her lover. Josie
		stopped her oral assault and moved up until her lips were near Rebecca's ear. With
		exquisite slowness, Josie brought two fingers to rest just outside the coral opening.
		"I love you." The words whispered into the young woman's ear could have been
		screamed for their intensity and force. With that,</p>

		<p>Josie's fingers found their mark, quickly entering her young
		lover. Rebecca gasped at the slight pain, then moaned at the feeling of having her lover
		inside her body. Her hips moved slowly at first, keeping pace with Josie's gentle
		stroking. It wasn't long before her body took over, increasing the tempo, demanding longer
		and deeper with each thrust. Her cries of passion flowed over Josie, intoxicating her with
		the power she held. There was no doubt in her mind that Rebecca wanted? no
		needed? more.</p>

		<p>"Yes?oh?Josie?" Rebecca's head was
		moving from side to side. She was</p>

		<p>completely lost in the throes of passion and didn't know how to
		ask for what she needed. "More?" She was rewarded with a third finger
		sliding in and filling her up beyond words and feelings. She knew she couldn't last much
		longer. Josie felt it too. She slid her long body down and slipped her tongue between
		Rebecca's wet folds. She sucked, licked, and nibbled on the young woman's clit until she
		felt the rising crescendo approaching. She shoved her fingers hard into Rebecca, causing
		the younger woman to moan in her pleasure. Her focus was on what the gunslinger was doing
		between her legs, the soft tongue caressing her, the firm fingers thrusting in and out.
		Both women knew that she wouldn't be able to hold out much longer.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca?come for me." Josie's hand was a blur as
		it entered and exited</p>

		<p>Rebecca's womb. She felt the spasms start around her fingers.</p>

		<p>"Come on?give your Josie what she wants?come
		on?give it to me?" Rebecca arched her back, forcing herself onto Josie's
		hand. Her hot tunnel gripped and</p>

		<p>released the fingers it held as she felt herself floating away on
		waves of</p>

		<p>ecstasy. "Oh God, Josie...Josie...OHHHHH!"</p>

		<p>"Shh, it's okay, I've got you." The gunslinger gently
		withdrew her</p>

		<p>fingers and pulled the young woman into a gentle embrace. "I
		love you, Sprite. I've got you and I'm never letting go." Still overcome by the force
		of her orgasm, Rebecca found herself completely overwhelmed by the gentle words and tender
		touches. She clung to Josie, who patiently continued to murmur endearments of love and
		devotion.</p>

		<p>Eventually Rebecca's pulse slowed back to a normal level and she
		focused on the warm, lean body pressed against her. Her left hand slowly moved down
		Josie's side, curving over the womanly flair of the gunslinger's hip and back up again.
		She felt the deep breath expelled and smiled in the darkness. Her touch did have an effect
		on the older woman.</p>

		<p>"You like that."</p>

		<p>"Mmm," Josie replied, resisting the urge to guide the
		roaming hand to</p>

		<p>where she wanted it most. Rebecca repeated the motion, increasing
		her exploration until her fingers brushed against wiry curls soaked with desire. The touch
		was too much for the gunslinger to ignore. With a loud groan she pulled the young woman on
		top of her and brought their mouths together.</p>

		<p>Rebecca slipped her tongue in and tasted herself in Josie's
		mouth. Passion fed boldness and she reached up between them to cup the gunslinger's left
		breast.</p>

		<p>"Ohh?you're so soft," she murmured. Although
		Rebecca wasn't experienced, she knew enough to know that what she liked her lover would
		enjoy as well. She brought her other hand in and had both of Josie's breasts under her</p>

		<p>control. "Am I too much for you?" she asked, knowing
		that all of her weight was on Josie. The gunslinger shook her head vigorously and wrapped
		her arms around Rebecca's back, holding her in place. The young woman rewarded her with
		another kiss as she rolled the nipples between her fingers, drawing growls of pleasure
		from the gunslinger's lips. They stayed like that for several minutes, throwing oil on the
		already out of control fire raging between them. Rebecca's leg slipped between Josie's
		thighs and the dark haired woman immediately tried to grind her sex against it.</p>

		<p>"God, Rebecca, please..." Josie's eyes closed when she
		felt one of</p>

		<p>Rebecca's hands move down between her legs and press against the
		dark triangle of fur. She responded by pressing hard against it, soaking the young woman's
		hand with her desire.</p>

		<p>"Yesss?" the gunslinger moaned huskily. "Oh,
		Rebecca, that's nice."</p>

		<p>"Josie?I want to pleasure you," the young woman
		said in a raspy voice. Her finger slipped between the folds and felt exquisite wetness. A
		smile crept</p>

		<p>to her lips. "Hmm, I do believe you are quite excited."
		She moved her finger slowly in and out, unsure of how fast or hard to press. Her shy
		movements made Josie's knees weaken as she fought not to swim away with the feelings that
		were coursing through her.</p>

		<p>"Yes?I am?rather?excited." The words
		came out in staccato bursts.</p>

		<p>"So am I." With that, they interlocked their legs,
		rubbing against each</p>

		<p>other. Their hands moved over each other, searching, learning.
		"Josie?" Her voice was barely audible. She had never felt a passion like
		this. Rebecca continued her exploration, placing another finger inside the warmth of her
		lover. The gunslinger's back arched, giving Rebecca more access. Slowly she moved the
		fingers in and out, watching Josie's face as the excitement was building. The dark haired
		woman raised her hips, meeting each thrust.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca?Oh?ahh?yes?yes?oh."
		Josie's words became incoherent as the passion consumed her. Rebecca placed her thumb on
		the swollen clit and rubbed</p>

		<p>hard, imitating what felt good to her. Her other hand was busy
		exploring the soft swell of Josie's breasts. The gunslinger's moans became louder as she
		lost control. Rebecca felt Josie?s hot tunnel tightening around her fingers. She
		pinched the nipples and increased her pumping as the outlaw's moans gave way to screams of
		pleasure. Josie's body stiffened as a powerful orgasm ripped through her and wave after
		wave of juice poured from the older woman. Rebecca stopped pumping and held her fingers
		still, waiting for Josie to return from ecstasy. Slowly, the body beneath her relaxed and
		she removed her fingers. They lay together for a time, not speaking. Josie's fingers drew
		lazy circles against Rebecca's back as their breathing slowed and reality once again
		intruded into their lives in the form of the music still drifting in from the porch.
		Rebecca?s hand rested on Josie?s breast and her head was snug on the tall
		woman?s shoulder. Her mind still reeled from everything that had happened that day,
		and she sighed.</p>

		<p>"This has been the most glorious day of my life,"
		Rebecca said softly. "I</p>

		<p>wish it would never end."</p>

		<p>"I?ll do my best to make the rest of your days as
		glorious as this one,"</p>

		<p>Josie replied. Rebecca mumbled something unintelligible against
		Josie?s breast, cuddled against her side and went to sleep.</p>
