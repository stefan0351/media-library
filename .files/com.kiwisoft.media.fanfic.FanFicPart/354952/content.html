<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 21: Night Demons -->

<p>Rebecca woke in the middle of the night to answer nature's call.
		When she finished her business and returned to the camp, she noticed Josie thrashing about
		in the midst of an obvious nightmare.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p><em>Genie moved up next to her, gun drawn. "Do you think
		they'll come?" she asked quietly. Josie didn't offer a glance in her direction,
		preferring to keep her eyes on the door.</em></p>

		<p><em>"If they do, we'll be ready for them," she replied.
		Her hands gripped her peacemakers nervously. Ten horses had been stolen from the ranch in
		the past two weeks and they were certain that the Double Bar was responsible. Genie's
		father refused to stand up to the bullies, knowing full well that the McCann's controlled
		not only the local sheriff, but the district judge as well. Genie and Josie figured that
		the only way to stop the horse thievery was to stand watch over the herd.</em></p>

		<p><em>The telltale creak of the barn door being opened drew their
		attention. Three men entered quietly, taking careful looks at the main house to see if
		they had been detected. They didn't notice the two teenagers hiding in the loft, guns
		drawn and aimed at them. Genie's youthful voice filled the air. "Don't move!"</em>
		</p>

		<p><em>John McCann, the youngest son of the Double Bar's owner,
		panicked immediately and started firing his gun in the direction of the loft. Reacting
		quickly, Josie began firing both guns in return. Within seconds it was over. Smoke from
		the guns hung in the air as both sides inspected the damage. John lay on the ground,
		bleeding profusely from a mortal wound. She felt the warm stickiness against her arm and
		turned to see Genie's lifeless eyes looking back at her.</em></p>

		<p><em>"Well if that don't beat all," the stocky man said
		as he raised his gun in her direction. "Looks like we done caught ourselves a little
		gal horse thief. Ah bet old man Sanders will be real pleased to see we done protected his
		horses from a stinkin' half-breed." He moved closer, knowing full well that her guns
		were empty. He looked up at the still body next to her. "Done gone and kilt his
		daughter too. Tsk tsk. Shame she couldn't tell 'em what really happened." He glanced
		over at the other man, who was busy removing anything of value from McCann's body.
		"Ain't that right, Bill?"</em></p>

		<p><em>Josie recognized Bill as one of the Sander's ranch hands.
		"Ayup, that'd be right, Tom. I saw it all with my own eyes, I did. That damn injun
		done come in here and tried to take off with the horses. Poor Genie come in to stop her
		and got a wooden overcoat for her trouble. Done killed Johnny too, damn horse thief."</em>
		</p>

		<p><em>Tom raised his gun again. "You gonna hang,
		half-breed."</em></p>

		<p><em>With speed born out of desperation, Josie jerked the gun from
		Genie's still hand and fired, catching Tom in the chest. Her second shot struck Bill in
		the cheek, sending him backward against a wooden post and knocking him out cold. The
		sounds of approaching ranchers and the elder Sander filled the air. She knew Genie's
		father hated her for her parentage and had forbade his daughter to see her. It came down
		to her word against Bill's, and she knew who would be believed. She got up and ran to the
		far side of the loft, kicked open the doors, and jumped to the ground below. She heard the
		shouts of the men as she was spotted. There was no choice for her now. Josie ran for the
		woods, never looking back. The men fired blindly, missing with every shot. "It's that
		half-breed friend of Genie's," she heard one of them say. She heard the crack of the
		rifle just as a burning pain seared through her upper arm.</em></p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Josie? Josie, wake up," Rebecca said as she shook her
		gently. The blue eyes popped open as the gunslinger bolted to a sitting position
		momentarily disoriented. Her hand reached instinctively to her left biceps, fully
		expecting it to be bleeding. Rebecca put her hand on Josie's right shoulder. "Hey,
		are you all right?"</p>

		<p>The bounty hunter took in her surroundings and let out a loud
		sigh. She pulled herself into a cross-legged position and rested her arms on her knees.
		Rebecca moved and fetched the canteen. It was only then that Josie realized that the young
		woman had been touching her. When she returned, Rebecca made no move to resume her
		position, merely handing the gunslinger the canteen and leaning back on her heels.
		"Another nightmare?", she asked softly. Josie took a deep swallow of water and
		nodded slightly, her gaze settling on the red embers of the fire. "Do you want to
		talk about it?" Rebecca ventured. "Sometimes it helps. I mean I know it does for
		me."</p>

		<p>There was a long silence while the gunslinger internally debated
		the question. "Make coffee.", she twisted sideways and grabbed a branch to stir
		the fire with. She knew that sleep would elude her for the rest of the night. Rebecca set
		the pot in the fire to heat up, then settled down an arm's length away from Josie.</p>

		<p>"When I was seventeen, I had a best friend...Genie."
		She said it so softly that Rebecca had to lean forward to hear. "When I first went
		back to live with my mother, she was the only person who didn't see me as being different
		just because my father was Cherokee. We became the best of friends; we were inseparable.
		Genie's father owned a small horse ranch and he found out that a neighboring ranch was
		stealing the horses, but he was too scared of them to do anything about it." She
		leaned forward and stirred the fire some more as she collected her thoughts. "Genie
		and I, we were young, we thought if we just caught them in the act that justice would be
		done." She snorted lightly. "Instead, Genie was killed, and I became
		wanted."</p>

		<p>"What happened?" Rebecca prodded gently as she poured
		coffee for Josie and herself. The gunslinger took the mug and stared at the wisps of steam
		that rose from the black abyss. "One of the men worked for Genie's father. He was
		helping them steal the horses. It would have been his word against mine." Her voice
		rang with bitterness. "I had no choice but to run."</p>

		<p>Rebecca started to ask a question, but the gunslinger's look made
		her think twice. They sat there quietly, staring at the fire as time passed. Rebecca's
		head bobbed as she tried to fight off sleep. "Go to bed, Rebecca." Josie's voice
		startled the young woman after so lengthy a silence. "Go on, get some sleep."
		</p>

		<p>Josie sat there long after Rebecca was asleep, remembering her
		brief friendship with Genie and the end of her innocence.</p>
