<!-- Perfect Misfits \ 3. Nine Home Runs -->

<p>A while later B'Elanna could hear some cheering and shouting coming from the far side of the village.  Curious she moved towards the noise and was surprised to see quite a sizeable crowd gathered around a clearing, clapping and shouting encouragement and abuse at some unseen entertainment.</p>
		<p>Pushing to the front she was astonished to see Seven of Nine armed with what appeared to be a large wooden stave and a small metal shield facing two angry looking Verroth who were similarly armed.</p>
		<p>"What the hell is going on?"</p>
		<p>A highly amused Verroth slapped her on the back and explained "Your woman is teaching our finest warriors a lesson."  One of the two armed Verroth charged the Borg who effortlessly sidestepped the man, deflected his blow with the shield and then followed it up with a swipe to his head with the stave which sent him crashing against a tree trunk where he subsided with a sigh.  "That makes eight" said the amused Verroth.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna then noticed that there were several Verroth in various states of unconsciousness littering the ground.  The remaining Verroth warrior soon joined them as Seven efficiently removed him from combat with a blow to his genitals that made the crowd groan in sympathy.  "Well that is that - a practice session that they won't soon forget."  said some wag in the background. Another round of laughter shook the assembled crowd.</p>
		<p>The watching Verroth then quarrelled with each other over bets laid in the course of the fight.  Gambling was an art form here.  Tom Paris would have been in Heaven.</p>
		<p>Seven of Nine, who was hardly breathing any more than normal, called out loudly to the Chief Engineer  "I do not believe Lieutenant that you will be troubled by any warrior that these inferior beings can produce."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna looked around nervously to see if the Verroth were taking any notice of Seven's insult.  Mostly they were not.  But across the other side of the combat area B'Elanna Torres could see the Medicine man and Scarface look up at Seven's words and then start a very animated conversation.</p>
		<p>"If you are trying to frighten the 'Love Doc' Seven I think you are barking up the wrong tree.  This is a matter of honour.  This guy isn't going to surrender because I might hurt him."</p>
		<p>Seven replied with certainty  "I do not think honour was the motivating factor in this challenge and it is my belief that the Doctor will be leaving.  Soon."</p>
		<p>"I don't think you understand Seven" said B'Elanna in a slightly patronising tone but as  they watched, the Medicine man shrugged his shoulders, turned and walked away from Scarface and disappeared into a nearby hut.  B'Elanna Torres narrowed her eyes and started after him.  Seven caught her arm.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna Torres looked at her with some annoyance.  "Seven I can look after myself in a fight and I do not need you to protect me."</p>
		<p>Abruptly Seven took her hand off the engineer's arm.  "I did not mean to cause offence Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>The Borg was interrupted by Scarface trying to make an announcement.</p>
		<p>"Fellow Verroth and honoured guests.  It is my misfortune to report a shameful occurrence. The Medicine man, Thrys, has run away from our village and will not defend his challenge to the mighty warrior B'Elanna Torres.  A howl of outrage came from one of the Verroth and then there was pandemonium as the crowd surged angrily towards Scarface who was now standing behind several henchmen who were trying to keep the mob away from him.</p>
		<p>Ensign Kominsky, a small pretty woman, was impressed by the fury of the crowd towards Scarface. "Poor guy.  Talk about shooting the messenger."</p>
		<p>"Their reaction is understandable Ensign.  Many of them believe they have just suffered a considerable loss."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna Torres stared at Seven who was watching the mayhem with apparent satisfaction.  "Seven of Nine how did you know the Doc would leave?"</p>
		<p>The Borg considered her words before speaking. "The so called doctor is what you might call a 'ringer'.  I heard two of Scarface' associates discussing the Medicine man and his prior history.  Apparently they did not know of my enhanced hearing."</p>
		<p>"And what is this prior history" asked B'Elanna Torres impatiently.</p>
		<p>"He is from another, distant, village and was here at Scarface's invitation for several weeks.  In his own area he is a very successful fighter and warrior but his abilities were not known in this village.  Medicine men are very poorly regarded and usually only rather feeble warriors enter that profession."  Seven paused as the quarrelling Verroth grew louder. </p>
		<p>"Scarface is a notable local bookmaker and most of the money wagered was on the Lieutenant winning the fight."</p>
		<p>"I think I see where this is going."  said the chief engineer and then added as an aside.  "After all I know Tom 'would you care to take a wager on that' Paris."</p>
		<p>Seven continued her explanation  "Scarface believed that the Lieutenant's prowess was overrated.  That together with his knowledge of the Medicine man's fighting abilities gave him an opportunity to deceive his fellow Verroth."</p>
		<p>Kominsky interrupted "So Scarface engineers the whole fight including the original challenge in order to make a killing on promoting the fight and running the book."</p>
		<p>"Precisely Ensign."</p>
		<p>Torres glared at no one in particular saying "The little slime ball probably intended to use his ringer against one of his own people but then we arrived and gave him an easier mark - me!  He had the cheek to question our honour.  I will kill the deceitful little bastard."</p>
		<p>"I do not think that is necessary Lieutenant.  He appears to be in great danger from his own people."   The pushing and shoving Verroth were becoming more agitated and weapons were being drawn.  Scarface could be heard shouting  "Everyone will get their money back."</p>
		<p>"I hope the ugly tick gets what he deserves."</p>
		<p>But that said the engineer did not like the look of the mob.  "OK people lets get back to our quarters.  This may get ugly.  I think we have been involved in enough fighting for one day."</p>
		<p>The Starfleet crew left the riot scene just as the first punches were being thrown.  Hoping they were not noticed they walked back to their hut.</p>
		<p>"I still don't understand Seven why Scarface changed his mind after seeing you despatch those Verroth on the practise ground." asked Kominsky.</p>
		<p>"The Verroth hierarchy is strictly based on physical strength and fighting prowess.  When Scarface saw what a 'mere minion' of the great warrior could do then his low risk scheme turned into certain ruin.  To prevent that outcome the fight had to be cancelled,  he forced the Medicine man to leave ensuring that all wagers would be void."</p>
		<p>"Let me get this straight Seven"  said Torres with a dangerous look on her face.  "You decided that it was OK for you to fight nine of their best warriors in order to prevent me fighting one."  She faced Seven of Nine and folded her arms.</p>
		<p>The Borg looked slightly wary but answered coolly.  "There was little danger.  It was only a practise session and the weapons were harmless."</p>
		<p>"Tell that to those Verroth warriors you whacked"  snorted Kominsky who subsided quickly  when Torres turned a furious gaze on the ensign.</p>
		<p>"Seven I thought you understood that I was in charge of this away mission.  You had no right to make a decision like that without bringing the information to me first."</p>
		<p>"You would not have agreed to my plan Lieutenant."  and then more hesitantly.  "I am sorry Lieutenant, it was not my purpose to challenge your authority.  It seemed .... like a good idea at the time."</p>
		<p>Astonished B'Elanna looked into Seven's candid blue eyes.  A phrase straight out of the Tom Paris book of excuses thought B'Elanna.  The Chief Engineer nearly laughed.</p>
		<p>And then did laugh when Seven of Nine tried again, clearly uncomfortable with her human excuse. She took a purely Borg approach.  "My actions were efficient."</p>
		<p>Seven looked relieved if puzzled at B'Elanna's reaction and the latter became aware of the other members of the away team also looking surprised at the sudden change of mood.  Trying to sound stern the engineer said "Seven, I know you tried to act for the best but next time talk to me.  I don't bite."</p>
		<p>"That is not what I have heard Lieutenant." said the Borg quite seriously.  Kominsky and Walther gasped and clutched each other.  B'Elanna counted to ten and decided that in this case it would be better to pretend she had not heard any comment.</p>
		<p>"Right lets get this camp cleaned up, it looks worse than a Starfleet cadet's bedroom."  B'Elanna worked out her frustration  bullying and shouting at her away team until the camp had been rearranged to her satisfaction,  dinner had been prepared, eaten and cleared and they were at last sitting quietly under the stars.  Kominsky and Walther had withdrawn from the circle around the fire and were deep in conversation.  B'Elanna watched them gaze into each other's eyes and wondered what they would do when they returned to Voyager and their respective partners.  That thought brought to mind to her own situation and she glanced at Seven of Nine hoping not to be too obvious.</p>
		<p>The Borg was staring at the fire. But sensing the Klingon watching she looked at the engineer and for a moment unguarded yearning seemed to fill her eyes.  Then the expression disappeared and the face of the ex drone took on it's normal neutral appearance.</p>
		<p>Torres felt embarrassed and not really knowing what to say or do lifted her mug of ale in a mock toast and grinned.</p>
		<p>Seven looked mystified and the engineer cringed.
			<i>Dear God, the woman has told you she cares for you,  is in obvious pain and all you can do is make stupid drunken gestures and grin like an idiot.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"Er Seven what you said this morning.  I didn't know ...  I did not mean to hurt you or anything."  B'Elanna cursed herself for not having the right words.
			<i>Kahless I am an engineer not a damned poet.</i>
		</p>
		<p>"It is not necessary to try and comfort me Lieutenant.  I have researched the rituals and protocol surrounding Human and Klingon mating and I am well aware that you have formed a bond with Ensign Paris which prohibits you forming other such relationships."</p>
		<p>"Don't be such a hard ass Seven,  I can show a bit of sympathy."</p>
		<p>"To what end Lieutenant?  Your sympathy does not change how I feel nor does it change the basic situation."  Seven glanced at the two human ensigns who were now kissing quite fiercely and remarked rather bitterly.  "It would appear that some humans are not as scrupulous about their personal loyalties, perhaps that is why I prefer a Klingon."</p>
		<p>After an awkward silence Seven spoke again.  "Since Ensigns Kominsky and Walther are occupied I will take the first watch." and so saying Seven of Nine got up and walked to the perimeter of the camp site.</p>
		<p>Torres watched the shapely figure recede into the darkness.  The Chief Engineer felt a sense of loss envelope her in a deeper blackness.</p>
		<p>Gerard, who had been placed on a mattress near the fire, sat up on her elbow and also watched the retreating Borg.  "You know Lieutenant I may have to rethink my prejudices about the Borg.  Perfect bod."  She whistled quietly.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna looked at the reclining figure by the fire with dislike.  "In your dreams Gerard,  in your dreams."</p>
		<p>"Well Lieutenant Torres it seems to me that you don't really have any say in that do you?"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna picked up a large pitcher of ale and stalked into the hut.
			<i>She will get over it.  Everyone has to go through crushes.</i>  The thought of Seven recovering from her feelings did not make B'Elanna feel any better.  The foggy feeling of loss just got bigger.

		<p>First sunrise brought the light, a hangover and Voyager.</p>
