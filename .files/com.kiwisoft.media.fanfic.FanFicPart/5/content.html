<!-- The Next Illogical Step - Chapter 1 -->

<p>Willow turned away from her computer screen to
give her eyes a much deserved rest, she looked over at the couch to check on her best
friend and lover, Buffy. The Slayer had fallen asleep on Giles couch again. Willow felt a
slight twinge of guilt knowing that she was the reason Buffy was sprawled here on the
couch instead of in her own warm comfortable bed next door in their townhouse. </p>

<p>She'd tried many times before to get her to go on
home to bed, but Buffy always mumbled something about not wanting to be alone any more and
refused to leave until Willow did. Willow noticed a slightly mischievous smile on the
sleeping girl's lips. </p>

<p>&lt;I wonder what's going on inside that pretty
head.&gt; Willow thought &lt;Something wickedly fun no doubt.&gt; </p>

<p>In the time since they had returned from Teach Tu
Dannan, both found that they simply couldn't get enough of each other. Even now, as tired
as she was, watching Buffy sleep Willow practically ached to take her blonde haired lover
in her arms and make love right there on Giles couch. &lt;Bad Willow, bad, bad Willow&gt;
she scolded herself. You must let the poor girl rest sometime or you'll wear her out and
then what would you do?&gt; </p>

<p>Willow sighed not wanting to ever think of life
without Buffy. She couldn't resist one more look at her before returning to work.
&lt;Goddess, she is so beautiful.&gt; Willow thought as the longing returned, &lt;I can't
believe she's mine at last.&gt; </p>

<p>Willow knew the other reason Buffy was so tired.
She'd found out that last night was one of Willow's sabats, Litha, the summer solstice,
and she had insisted on joining Willow in the ritual that had lasted until shortly before
dawn. As always after a celebrating a ritual Willow was energized, but poor Buffy was
completely worn out. As she turned back to her computer, Willow heard Giles mumbling
something to himself in his study. He too was deeply immersed in his own research. </p>

<p>Ever since they had shown up on his door step with
their gifts from Brigit, Morrigan, and Lugh, Giles had been like a kid in a candy store.
First he went to work translating the runes, and writings on the weapons and Willow's
staff. After finishing that he gathered the staff, the wooden dagger, and the rings and
took them all to a jeweler he knew to have the stones identified and appraised. </p>

<p>All four of the large green stones turned out to
be very rare very valuable emeralds and the four smaller red stones in the hilt of the
dagger were nearly flawless blood rubies. The man had tried everything to get Giles to
sell them but he'd steadfastly refused. Once he had finished with all he could find
on those artifacts, he turned to the one task he knew he'd love, the book. He became
obsessed with it he was unable to stop himself, if it hadn't been for Buffy and Willow he
would have starved to death studying that book. </p>

<p>Try as she might Willow was unable to fault him
for his obsession, it had saved Buffy's life more than once. Willow had to smile when she
thought of the look on his face when he came charging out of the study, to share his findings the first time. </p>

<p>&quot;I can not believe this it's just so
bloody marvelous, Giles kept saying pacing too excited to sit. &quot;After god knows how
long, I am the first watcher to ever see this and since we have broken off contact with
the council I can't even tell them about it.&quot; </p>

<p>He translated some more then began muttering. </p>

<p>&quot;This is just fantastic.&quot; he said to
himself then turned to the two girls that were staring at him like he was insane. &quot;Do
you have any idea what this is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we knew that then why would we need
you.&quot; Buffy said sarcastically, she'd had a bad day in class. </p>

<p>Some times she wondered if 'coming out' was worth
all the trouble but, one look at Willow always answered that question. </p>

<p>&quot;Buffy!&quot; Willow scolded &quot;Be nice,
Giles isn't the one you're mad at.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Right, sorry Giles, my bad.&quot; Buffy
apologized </p>

<p>Giles looked at Buffy surprised, now he knew
Willow was good for her, she had never apologized before. </p>

<p>&quot;Translating these kinds of things is your
specialty Giles,&quot; Willow continued, &quot;Buffy and I wouldn't have the slightest
idea where to even begin. You are the one that figured out that my staff was made
specifically for me, to focus and amplify my powers, you learned that the dirks were once
called the 'Spurs of Erin' and that the wooden dagger was a Pictish artifact known as
'Demon Claw', all very helpful information in finding out their uses and now you have
found out something about the origins of the book. I'm not surprised Brigit said you were
the one to turn to. We trust you completely.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Oh..well...yes..I appreciate your
trust.&quot; Giles stumbled, embarrassed by the young witch's praise, he cleared his
throat then continued &quot;Getting back to the book, I haven't gotten much past the title
and a few lines here and there, but from what I gather, what you girls brought home is the
'Book of Souls'.&quot; He paused expecting a reaction when none was forth coming he
explained further. </p>

<p>&quot;Well I suppose that would mean nothing to
you, but believe me this is a major find.&quot; He lectured, &quot;It was the repository
for much of the Druid lore, their grimoire so to speak. It is even said that it holds the
secrets of creation and making thus also their opposites.&quot; </p>

<p>There was a hiss as Willow drew in a sharp breath
through clenched teeth. </p>

<p>&quot;Exactly so.&quot; Giles said looking at the
young witch over the top of his glasses. &quot;The power these people have entrusted into
your hands is unfathomable. Their confidence and trust in you is unbelievably strong. The
last time anyone heard of this book being seen was before the time of King Arthur and the
Christian incursion into Ireland. It was said to have been returned to the gods and most
scholars believed it was either destroyed or that it never existed in the first place. I
guess now we know the truth.&quot;</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Giles was in watcher heaven. With the help of
Willow's expertise the two of them came up with a program to help him translate the
various languages used in the book. Every day he found some new medicine spell or piece of
nformation that had him running around all excited. </p>

<p>Soon between Willow being 'Research Girl' on her
computer and Giles progress with the 'Book of Souls' they'd pretty much learned just about
everything they wanted to know about the gifts and their uses, all that is except the
rings. This soon became Willow's obsession, stopping only to eat or patrol with Buffy,
Willow spent nearly every waking moment searching any historical data base she could find,
but still no luck. </p>

<p>She finally got so bad that Buffy had suggested
that she go to the goddess either for help or at least some perspective on the subject.
Seeing no other available option Willow had done just that last night. Yet here she was
again, with her nose buried in her computer, searching. &lt;I guess sometimes the answer
is no.&gt; she thought discouraged. </p>

<p>At that moment an accidental missed keystroke
placed her in a section of the Vatican library she'd never been in before. It was the
forbidden books section, Willow had picked up rumors about this area but had never been
able to find it, until now. As she read through the thousands of files, Willow came across
the mention of a an ancient sect of Celtic female warriors called 'Sisters of the Soul.
Excited and thanking the goddess Willow began searching and cross referencing her way into
several deeply encrypted files that the Church considered so heathen and so blasphemous
that only the most dedicated priests were allowed to see them. </p>

<p>Delving deep into these files Willow finally found
an eyewitness account over one thousand years old telling of the sect and many of the
ceremonies and rites they practiced. It was here that Willow learned the purpose of the
rings and where to look in the 'Book of Souls' to find the details. It was also here she
learned the truth behind the disappearance of the sect. Because the ceremony called upon
ancient gods and was the mating of two people of the same sex, the Church declared it
blasphemous and an obscenity in the eyes of their god. So they began a systematic campaign
to wipe out all knowledge of the sect, including hiring assassins to murder the women. </p>

<p>Tears were in Willow's eyes as she realized this
was a record of hypocrisy and deceit as old as time but the idea of someone supposedly on
the side of the Light committing the atrocities she was reading about was unforgivable.
Especially when it was women of the same caliber as their friends Brigit and Morrigan.
&lt;Those Bastards!!&gt; Willow said to herself &lt;I hope they're burning in their own
private hell!&gt;</p>

<p>The more Willow read the angrier she became until,
after she copied all the information, Willow fed a virus she'd created into the system
that would not only cover her tracks but it would also destroy everything in the files
she'd been reading if not that entire section of their library including the hard drive.
That done Willow gathered the print outs and went to show Giles. </p>
