<P>Janeway paced back and forth on the bridge worried sick about what could be
happening to the away team down on the planet. But secretly she was worried that
Seven would push Torres too far and she would just explode. Janeway and the rest
of the crew were well aware of the effect that the Borg had on Lt. Torres.
Janeway looked up and asked for the hundredth time, "Anything Tuvok?" </P>
<P>"Still no comm link from the away team Captain. None of the measures we have
taken have been able to penetrate the bio-electric field around the planet."
Tuvok answered coolly. </P>
<P>"Well, keep trying Tuvok. You never know when communications might come back
on line. I'll be in my ready room, call me the moment you figure something out."
With that Janeway left the bridge hoping she didn't look too rattled. The
bio-electric field had come up around the planet an hour after planet fall.
Voyager had tried to contact the away team but failed. Now the senior staff was
working around the clock to get communications back on line.</P>
<P>Back on the planet, Janeway's worries were about to come true. B'Elanna was
breathing heavily. "Okay, let me get this straight. We're trying to contact
Voyager, and you suddenly decide to take a bite out of my last apple." B'Elanna
shot Seven a look that most crew members would have dread. Even Ensign Parker
couldn't bear to watch. </P>
<P>Seven returned the look in her cool Borg manner. "Lt. Torres I believe you
are hyper-ventilating and should seek medical attention immediately."</P>
<P>"What?" Torres screamed. "You're the one that should be seeking medical
attention after I'm done with you. B'Elanna stepped closer to Seven intent on
living out her holo-deck fantasy. Ensign Parker took a peak at the situation and
spoke up to stop B'Elanna from doing something she knew she would regret. "Lt.
Torres?" Parker squeaked. </P>
<P>B'Elanna turned agitatedly. "What?" </P>
<P>"Ummm… If you want I could go get some more apples right now. I promise I'll
be back before you know it." Parker hoped this would help diffuse the explosive
situation.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was about to scream that this wasn't about apples, it was the fact
that Seven took something that was hers without asking. But somehow, somewhere a
voice inside her head told her to take the opportunity that Ensign Parker had
given her to get out of this situation.</P>
<P>B'Elanna breathed heavily and nodded an okay. Ensign Parker quickly got up
and ran towards the apple patch 2 km away. B'Elanna on the other hand silently
picked up her tricorder and started scanning for what could be interfering with
their comm link. Inside she was fuming, but she tried her best ignore Seven
munching on her apple. B'Elanna kept telling herself that once she figured out a
way to make contact with Voyager and got back to the ship, she would kick
whoever it was out of holo-deck 1 and start up her favorite program. </P>
<P>While B'Elanna was looking at the readings on the tricorder, Seven decided
that it would be more efficient if she helped. So she dropped her half-eaten
apple to the ground and picked up her tricorder. "I believe I may be of
assistance." Seven offered. B'Elanna turned around to see the apple on the
ground and just lost it. "You bitch!" B'Elanna rushed at Seven and took a swing
with her right fist. Seven with her Borg enhanced reflexes caught B'Elanna's arm
easily. B'Elanna dropped the tricorder in her left hand ready to use her left
fist instead. But it was just as easily snatched up by the blonde Borg. B'Elanna
looked straight into Seven's face without flinching and breathing angrily. They
were nose to nose when Seven spoke up. "Your attempts to strike me will
undoubtedly fail. </P>
<P>B'Elanna struggled with all her strength to get her arms free from Seven's
grasp, but was unsuccessful. "Let me go! That's an order Seven, or would you
rather I report your actions to Captain Janeway?" Seven quickly let go of her
grasp as if the half-Klingon's arms had burned her. B'Elanna was surprised to
say the least. Everyone knew that Seven and the Captain were close, but the way
Seven reacted when B'Elanna threatened to tell the Captain, made her think that
there might be something more to the relationship. </P>
<P>Although Seven had constantly questioned the Captains orders in front of the
crew, she had grown to respect Janeway's stubborn attitude. And she didn't want
to disappoint her mentor on something so trivial. </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her arms, and teased "What's a matter Seven, don't wanna
upset your Captain?" She had to emphasize the word your. She knew she was
walking a fine line, but somehow she doubted this conversation would be heard by
anyone other than the two of them.</P>
<P>Seven picked up the tricorder B'Elanna had dropped in the struggle and tried
her best to ignore B'Elanna's tease. "I believe we should get back to solving
our current predicament." Seven had tried the human equivalent of changing the
subject. B'Elanna looked puzzled, as she never took Seven to feel uncomfortable
about anything. After all, Seven never seemed to mind bringing up other crew
members sex lives in full surround sound. </P>
<P>Seven analyzed the tricorder readings hoping for something to stop the
torture of B'Elanna's stare. At last she found what she was looking for. "It
seems that a bio-electric field is interfering with our communications, and thus
must also be interfering with Voyager's sensor array. Therefore, we will not be
able to beam off the surface until Voyager can come up with a means of
penetrating the field." Seven sounded relieved.</P>
<P>B'Elanna still wanted an answer to her question but was curious about Seven's
findings. "What do you mean a bio-electric field?" B'Elanna stepped closer to
Seven and grabbed the tricorder. </P>
<P>"A bio-electric field is emanating from an unknown source, and seems to be
surrounding the planet. Thus, blocking further communication with Voyager."
Seven was extremely glad Lt. Torres did not push the issue with Captain
Janeway.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stared at the readings, thinking that it had to be wrong. "How is
this possible? I haven't seen anything bigger than a fox on this planet." Torres
continued to study the readings. Seven picked up her own tricorder. "I believe I
can recalibrate the three tricorders we have to emit a single signal to
Voyager." Seven recommended. B'Elanna was skeptical, but decided they had no
other alternative at the moment. </P>
<P>"Okay, since I see no other option, you can recalibrate both Ensign Parker's
and your tricorder, while I use mine to try and figure out where this
bio-electric field is coming from." B'Elanna was finally starting to calm down
and figured that she had more than enough time to tease Seven about Janeway.
</P>
<P>"Very well, I will start immediately." Seven took Ensign Parker's tricorder
and began to recalibrate it in her Borg efficient manner. B'Elanna walked some
20 meters away from the transport site, so as to put some distance between
herself and the Borg she had almost struck a short time earlier. "What the hell
was I thinking." She muttered to herself. "If I had actually hit her, Janeway
would of probably sent me to the Brig and left me there for the rest of the ride
home." B'Elanna scolded.</P>
