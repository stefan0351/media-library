<!-- World Without Love \ Part 6 -->

<p>Back in Engineering B'Elanna assigned the tasks to her crew. She assigned Seven to work with herself, as she knew the others couldn't work with Seven, being either nervous around the ex-Borg or intimidated by her. B'Elanna was neither and with their new understanding she felt she and Seven could work together really good.</p>

		<p>She was right. Since Seven had come back from her visit to sickbay, they both had worked together for more than 2 hours in silence, not uncomfortable but companionable silence. Instinctively knowing when the other needed a tool or what the other was doing. All that silence gave B'Elanna time to think, for what she was grateful, since she really needed to think.</p>

		<p>Contemplating Tom and their relationship, she finally came to the conclusion that it was time, actually past time, to break up with him. The only thing they still shared were arguments, the time when B'Elanna had thought she loved Voyager's pilot was long gone. And Seven of Nine the ex-Drone had cut down right to the reason why she had stayed with him for so long; B'Elanna didn't want to be alone. It was not the honorable thing to do and it was not fair to Tom. So it was only 'logical' to break up, as Seven or Tuvok would express it. Having made this decision she had absolutely no idea on how to do it. Should she just come out and say it or should she . Her quite contemplation was suddenly interrupted when Seven unexpectedly spoke up and said, "It is time for you to ingest nutritional supplements."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna startled. "What?!"</p>

		<p>"You need to 'eat', B'Elanna. I know you worked without a break for the last 7 hours, and since it was 4 o'clock in the morning when you began your shift, and mess hall wasn't open at that time you perhaps haven't even had breakfast. To maintain maximum efficiency you need to eat, now. I will keep you company, we could talk about the repairs while you eat." Seven stated that all with her normal bearing. She wasn't expecting any resistance, for it was futile. And B'Elanna wasn't about to give her any.</p>

		<p>"Err, okay," she was touched by how thoughtful Seven was. And if she was honest she was really hungry, and was even prepared to eat one of Neelix strange concoctions. Although, when she thought about it, he had really improved his cooking over the past 5 years.</p>

		<p>So they went to the mess hall where B'Elanna got a dish, and Seven sat down at a table. "So Seven, you don't eat?" B'Elanna tried to small talk.</p>

		<p>"My alcoves provide all energy I need to maintain my maximum efficiency, but the Doctor has introduced me to eating," judging from the look on her face it wasn't a pleasurable experience.</p>

		<p>"I take it you didn't like it very much," B'Elanna inquired, an amused look on her face.</p>

		<p>Seven just said: "No." Short and to the point as usual, when coming from Seven.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't know what else to say, so she just stopped talking and began eating. While she ate Seven read from the padd she had brought along.</p>

		<p>When B'Elanna had finished eating she looked curiously at Seven, wondering what kind of text captured her so completely. "Seven, what are you reading?" When her new friend didn't answer she tried again. "Seven, hello?"</p>

		<p>Seven startled and finally looked up. She had an unfamiliar glow in her eyes. B'Elanna looked briefly at the padd Seven still held, to anyone other it would have just looked like endless lines of numbers, but she recognized it for what it was: sensor readings in Borg computer language. "You won't believe what I just found, " Seven said cryptically.</p>

		<p>"Are you okay, Seven?"</p>

		<p>That was definitely not like Seven's usual style of speaking and there was something other, she seemed quite pleased with herself?</p>

		<p>"Yes, I was going over the sensor readings of our time in the nebula, before the sensor phalanxes went off-line," Seven explained, gesturing to the padd that lay on the table, "and I found some unusual data indeed, there were verteron emanations in the nebula and an increased level of neutrinos, all indicative of -" Seven had no chance to finish her sentence as B'Elanna interrupted her. "A wormhole." Seven nodded.</p>

		<p>"We need to get back to Engineering, the sensors are as of now our top priority and we need to inform the captain and ...." B'Elanna's mind was racing, all possibilities of this discovery were popping up in her head as she considered what had to be done. "We need to check where it leads to, if it's the right time, the right size, the ...."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?" Seven interrupted B'Elanna, "Perhaps we should first inform the captain."</p>

		<p>"Of course, thanks Seven, my mind just sometimes runs in wild circles. This could be our way home." Suddenly B'Elanna began to fully comprehend what that would mean. Home, the Alpha Quadrant, but not the same place she had left almost 5 years ago, there was no longer a Maquis and .... She was dragged out of her thoughts by Seven who had stood up and was now standing expectantly before her.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, of course let's get to the Captain, although ...... it's your discovery I hadn't a thing to do with it."</p>

		<p>Seven had another opinion. "In fact I merely went over the logs and saw it, the sensors only picked it up because of the recalibrations to the sensor phalanxes you made last week," B'Elanna remembered the recalibrations, after yet another fight with Tom she had had to do something so she picked a system and just tried to enhance it, apparently she had succeeded. "Besides, next to the captain you're the one on the ship who knows most about such phenomena as wormholes."</p>

		<p>Seven took B'Elanna's hand and practically pulled her out of the seat she had occupied and out of mess hall, the Klingon was not protesting but was glad that the mess hall was rather empty at that time of the day, Alpha shift only came in in an hour to eat, so not so many saw her and Seven's interaction. Although the chief-engineer didn't struggle Seven still held her hand, she liked the feeling of the shorter woman's soft but firm hand in her own and made no move to let her go. As for B'Elanna, she felt slowly heat creeping up from her hand to her arm, extending to her whole body. 'Oh Kahless, no that isn't happening, not Seven, I have just come to like her, there is nothing else' B'Elanna tried to convince herself. In her panic she tried to break the contact, yanking her arm away, but Seven did not "comply", only when the turbo lift doors opened and admitted the bridge she let the half-Klingon's hand go.</p>

		<p>"We need to speak with Captain Janeway," Seven took the lead and spoke to Chakotay who was in command of the bridge.</p>

		<p>"The Captain is in her ready room, but I don't think-"</p>

		<p>"Thank you Commander," she said and just proceeded to the ready room door, once again pulling B'Elanna along. The Klingon was quite amused by Seven's behavior, she seemed so childlike in her enthusiasm to get to break the news to Janeway. Also she enjoyed the physical contact, besides the unsettling feelings it caused, there were only few people on Voyager who touched her without thinking it might be dangerous to intrude into a Klingon's personal space. And Seven did it unconsciously, so she did not fear the Klingon, which made B'Elanna happy, but she was quick to ignore that particular feeling. Luckily they were now in the Captain's ready room and B'Elanna could concentrate on the situation at hand.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Neither Seven or B'Elanna saw the gaping mouths on bridge that were caused by the way B'Elanna seemed to like being dragged around by Seven. Tom too was surprised, but not as much as the others, he knew B'Elanna better then most and perhaps saw more clearly what was coming than either she or Seven. 'You didn't see that blonde coming and taking away your girl friend, Tommy boy,' an annoying voice in his head reminded him. He was B'Elanna's friend and in his heart he had always known it wouldn't work out for them, he decided to break up with her before she could do it, for he knew Klingon's took love very seriously and it would probably be easier for her, when he initiated their break up.</p>
