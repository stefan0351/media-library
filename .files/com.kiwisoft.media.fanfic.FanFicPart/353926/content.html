<!-- Change Of Mind \ Part 3 -->

<p>Ally could simply stare at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling feeling a bit awkward smiled insecurely and said, "Well are you going
to say anything?"</p>

<p>"Y... You are sorry?" Ally managed to reply stammering not believing she
actually heard Ling apologizing to her.</p>

<p>"Yes you were right all the time." Ling blushed. "I was just afraid. I
have actually never been in love with anyone before, and certainly not in a
woman." she confessed.</p>

<p>"You are in l... love with me?" Ally continued to stammer.</p>

<p>Ling simply nodded making Ally feel a warm feeling go through her body.
Then she got a suspicious look and said, "You are not playing with me so
that we can start work again?" The question was answered of Ling with a
negative shake of her head. They looked at eachother a long time and then
suddenly Ling leaned forward and kissed Ally. The kiss was brief but
intensive.</p>

<p>Ally closed her eyes and with a broad smile whispered, "More." which Ling
had nothing against obeying.</p>

<p>Renee stood and saw how Ally and Ling began to kiss eachother. She still
felt a little bit unpleasant to the thought of two women kissing but
managed to shrug it off. She thought that Ally maybe finally would be
happy. Walking towards her bedroom she shook her head amazed that someone
could prefer the same sex instead of the opposite.</p>

<p>After they had kissed a couple of times, Ling looked at Ally with serious
eyes. "I'm still new to all this... I... I don't know how far I'm ready to
go right now."</p>

<p>Looking a little bit relieved Ally replied, "I'm as new to this as you
are." smiling a reassuring smile at Ling she added, "I don't want to go to
fast either. Let's take it easy and work on this slowly, ok?"</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me." Ling replied. She thought for a moment and then
asked, "What are you doing tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Nothing special, why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"How about dinner?"</p>

<p>Pretending to think it over Ally answered after a short moment, "When?"</p>

<p>"Well. how about six o'clock?" Ling suggested.</p>

<p>"Sounds perfect to me." Ally answered. She then looked at Ling seeming to
hesitate.</p>

<p>"Do you want to ask me something?" Ling asked noticing Ally's hesitation.</p>

<p>"Well... Would you like to spend the night here?" Ally asked and held her
breath while waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a little bit to fast? I mean sleeping with eachother?" Ling
asked, hesitant to the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that we have sex... I just want you to be here so that
I know that this isn't some mean dream I have." Ally explained. Blushing
slightly of embarrassment. "We have an extra bed that you could use."</p>

<p>Ling closed the little space between them again and said before she kissed
Ally, "I assure you this is not a dream."</p>

<p>"Will you stay with me then?"</p>

<p>"Why not." Ling shrugged. "It's not like we have anything to do
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Not?" Ally looked wondering at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling got a mischievous grin and explained, "Well, I thought we could take
the day off."</p>

<p>Ally returned the grin and nodded. "Yeah, let's take tomorrow off."</p>

<p>"Ehrm..." they were interrupted by Renee. When she got their attention
she said, "I'm going to make some coffee do you two want anything?"</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling who nodded and then looked back at Renee, "That would
be nice, thanks." she said giving Renee a smile.</p>

<p>Renee brought a plate with three cups of coffee. She put it on the coffee
table and sat down in an armchair looking curios at the couple in the
couch. "So, are you two an official couple now?" she asked smiling, her
eyes got that teasing look Ally had came to know very well.</p>

<p>Ally expecting Renee to tease them looked at her with a mock angry look but
before she could respond Ling answered, "Yeah, we are a couple. I'm even
going spend the night here."</p>

<p>"You had to tell her that?" Ally asked worried Renee wouldn't want to
know it.</p>

<p>"Why not? We're not going to have sex so why would it bother her." Ling
looked at Renee. "It doesn't bother you that I'm sleeping over here right?"</p>

<p>Renee shook her head. "Nope." she said. "Ally don't worry. We both have had
guys sleeping over so why would it bother me if she slept over?"</p>

<p>"Well eh..." Ally couldn't think of an answer.</p>

<p>Renee looked at her annoyed. "Ally! I told you I would support you whatever
you do, well almost everything except criminal actions." Renee exclaimed
knowing what Ally thought. "Why are you so afraid I would start hate you
just because you are gay?"</p>

<p>"I don't know... Guess I'm simply scared of all this new things happening
to me." Ally trailed off, too ashamed to meet Renee's eyes.</p>

<p>"You're wrong." Renee simply stated. "You're not afraid of this being
gay. I think you're afraid of those feelings you have for Ling here." Renee
continued. "I remember how you looked like after Billy left you and now I
think you are afraid it will happen all over again with Ling."</p>

<p>Ling took Ally's hand. "If it is any comfort for you, I'm also scared to
death that this won't work out as good as I hope it will."</p>

<p>Ally smiled back at Ling. "I... I love you." she said simply letting her
self drown in Ling's beautiful dark eyes. Giving away a small chuckle Ally
commented, "It feels like we've said this all before. I must be dense, not
realizing it."</p>

<p>"Nah... you are just you. That's what I like about you." Ling replied
moving even closer to Ally than before.</p>

<p>Renee stood up and stretched her arms in the air. "It's late and I have to
go up early." she looked at the other two. "Do you two lovebirds want me to
wake you up or are you going to have a late morning?"</p>

<p>Ling replied with a smile. "We're going to take a free day tomorrow so I
don't think it will be necessary to wake us up."</p>

<p>"Ok. Good night then and promise to not make to much noises kids." Renee
said with her teasing voice getting angry stares after her, she run into
her bedroom and the safety.</p>

<p>When Renee had closed her bedroom door Ling turned her face to Ally and
asked, "Is she always like that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah... She loves to tease me, since she knows I don't really get hurt
by it." Ally replied as she placed the empty cups on the plate and brought
them to the sink. "Do you want a nightgown or anything to sleep in?" Ally
asked from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Ling had begun to look at some pictures Ally had on the shelf above the
fireplace. "I don't need anything. I can sleep in my underwear." she
answered.</p>

<p>"Okay. The right side of the bathroom cabinet is mine. There should be an
unused toothbrush there that you can use." Ally continued from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Do you need any help?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm almost finished. You go on and get ready for bed."</p>

<p>Ling nodded and went in to the bathroom looking for the toothbrush. She
found it and a tube with toothpaste beside it. When she was brushing her
teeth Ally knocked on the door. "Yeah what is it?" Ling slurred, her mouth
filled with toothpaste, saliva and toothbrush.</p>

<p>"Can I come in?" Ally asked. When no one answered, Ally went in and saw
Ling standing before the bathroom cabinet and brushing her teeth. The
toothbrush she used had a red color and Ally recognized it as her own.
"Eh... That is my toothbrush." she said.</p>

<p>Ling spit out the mix of saliva and toothpaste in the basin and said, "Oh,
I'm sorry. I didn't find any others."</p>

<p>"It's okay. I have put out the extra bed and put it beside my own." Ally
said and went over to Ling. "I have put on clean sheets too."</p>

<p>Ling washed her mouth and dried it with a towel Ally passed to her. "Sounds
fine to me." she said smiling at Ally.</p>

<p>Ally leaned forward and gave Ling a small kiss on her cheek and said, "I'll
be right with you."</p>

<p>Ling nodded and went out to Ally's bedroom.</p>

<p>When Ally came out of the bathroom Ling lied in the extra bed and turned
her head looking at Ally. Ally looked at Ling and they held eye contact for
about five minutes, then Ally went over to her own bed and slipped down
under her sheets. Looking at Ling she finally said, "Good night." and
turned off the light.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ling lied in the bed she had woken some minutes before and couldn't go to
sleep again. "Ally?" she whispered, to low to wake Ally who slept like a
log. "Ally!" Ling said a little bit higher now awakening Ally who stirred.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Ally opened her eyes to see Ling's face right over her. "Hi
there..." she said smiling and looked around. "It doesn't seem to be
morning yet."</p>

<p>"I know but it's freezing. Where do you have an extra blanket?" Ling
asked as she moved to sit beside Ally.</p>

<p>Ally yawned and thought for a moment. "There should be a blanket in my
closet but... I don't feel like going to fetch it. You can sleep beside me,
that would be warmer."</p>

<p>"Well, we could try it at least. You didn't plan this did you?" Ling
asked as she slid down beneath Ally's quilt. Ally giggled as she shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You're freezing!" Ally exclaimed as she felt Ling's feet touch hers.</p>

<p>"I told you. I was freezing."</p>

<p>"Yeah that you were freezing not that you were this cold. Come closer so
that I can warm you up."</p>

<p>"Ally, I can't come any closer than what I am."</p>

<p>"Oh... I missed that." Ally giggled. "I must still be sleeping."</p>

<p>"Yeah, sleep well."</p>

<p>"You too." Both women got silent and soon they both slept like logs.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Renee peeked in at Ally's bedroom. She couldn't resist seeing if they
actually had had sex or not. What she saw was an Ally and a Ling sprawled
together in Ally's bed. Convincing Renee that they had had sex during the
night. Chuckling for herself she thought that they at least had been quiet.
She closed the bedroom-door and went over to the bathroom to get ready for
today.</p>

<p>Ally opened her eyes looking at Ling. "She has closed the door."</p>

<p>"I know. I just don't want to move." Ling replied her eyes still shut.
"Do you think we tricked her?"</p>

<p>"Well... Let's see, we are both naked, lie in bed together, she also know
we are kind a couple and finally we were sleeping. Well pretending to
sleep. I think she bought it." Ally smiled, they had paid back for Renee's
teasing the night before.</p>

<p>"You know... Even though I want to sleep with you I don't really know
how." she heard the other woman say as she snuggled closer to her.</p>

<p>Ally giggled. "Neither do I."</p>

<p>Ling opened her eyes looking at Ally. "I'm sure whatever you do would be
just wonderful."</p>

<p>They looked at eachother thinking how it would be to touch the other woman
would it be as it always been? Or would it feel different? Ally remembered
how it had felt when they had lied there to trick Renee, she wanted to feel
that again but decided it could wait till later when both were sure they
weren't doing any mistakes. "I'm hungry." she exclaimed. "Wonder if Renee
have done any breakfast?"</p>

<p>"I'm also hungry. Why not go and see what you have in your fridge?" Ling
asked.</p>

<p>"Okay, let's go." Ally said and climbed out of the bed.</p>

<p>"Eh... Ally..." Ling smiled a bit embarrassed at Ally who stood beside
the bed.</p>

<p>"Yes? What is it?" Ally looked back with an asking look.</p>

<p>"Well maybe you should put something on yourself..." Ling said a bit
amused.</p>

<p>Ally then remembered she was stark naked. "Oh, you're right. Sorry I seem
to be a bit absent-minded."</p>

<p>"I don't mind at all but I think Renee might." Ling replied as she also
got up and out of the bed.</p>

<p>Ally checked in her closet and threw a pink satin bathrobe and then put on
another one she had. They walked out into the kitchen where Renee were busy
fried some eggs.</p>

<p>"Are you two actually eating eggs to breakfast?" Ling asked when she saw
the fried eggs in the pan.</p>

<p>"Yes." Renee replied. "Guess you don't want any?"</p>

<p>"No. It is too much cholesterol." Ling dismissed the offer. "I would like
some coffee and a glass of orange juice."</p>

<p>"And you?" Renee mentioned at Ally who had sat down beside Ling.</p>

<p>"Oh... You don't have to do anything. Since we are going to take the day
off, I can make our breakfast." Ally said. She stood up and began to walk
at the fridge.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought when I'm already doing my own breakfast I can do it for
you two. Besides, I imagine you two are quite exhausted anyway." Renee
answered with a big teasing grin.</p>

<p>Ally and Ling looked at her with amused faces. Something Renee didn't
expect. "We didn't have any sex at all last night." Ling told Renee as she
and Ally began to giggle.</p>

<p>"That wasn't nice." Renee grimaced at Ally. "Now I won't have any gossip
to tell Elaine." she replied with a grin, knowing Ally's reaction.</p>

<p>"What?" Ally's eyes were big as saucers. "Don't even dare to think of
telling anyone at my office about who slept over here!" she screamed at
Renee. She moved towards Renee with a knife in her hand.</p>

<p>She was held back by Ling who when Ally had calmed down turned towards
Renee and said with a dangerous voice, "She is right. If you tell anyone of
our common 'friends', they will have to defend me and Ally for murder."</p>

<p>Renee held up her hands in front of her in a defending pose, "I won't tell
them anything. I was just teasing."</p>

<p>"You better be..." Ally mumbled still looking angry on Renee.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on! Ally, you know I won't tell anyone if you don't want to."
Renee insured Ally.</p>

<p>They all went quiet for an awkward moment. Then Ally nodded.</p>

<p>Renee looked at her watch and cried out, "Oh hell I'm late!" She looked at
Ally and asked with one word, "Friends?"</p>

<p>Ally nodded again, "Yes friends."</p>

<p>As Renee hurried out of the apartment she called out a, "Bye!" to Ally and
Ling.</p>

<p>After the door had shut Ling looked at Ally. "So, what do you want do to
day?"</p>

<p>Ally thought for a moment and then said, "Well, I think there is a new
antiquarian bookstore down street. I kinda like old books..."</p>

<p>Ling smiled at Ally. "You're kidding! Me too." she said. "Do you like the
feeling to hold a really old book? 'Cause I love to touch it and smell the
scent of them."</p>

<p>Ally nodded. "Yeah, I love that with old books."</p>

<p>"Do you know when it is open?"</p>

<p>"Sometime around nine, I think."</p>

<p>"What do we do till then?"</p>

<p>"Eating breakfast." Ally replied as she handed Ling a bowl with milk and
light müsli.</p>

<p>"Okay, what's this?" Ling looked down at the bowl.</p>

<p>"Milk and extra healthy müsli." Ally replied. She sat down beside Ling
and began to eat from her own bowl.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The door to the bookstore made a small bell sound with a light tone. Ally
and Ling stepped inside it and began to look around. Ling took up an old
book about the civilwar. As she read inside it an old letter fell out. She
took it up and read the receiver's name on it. Surprised she saw it had
been sent to her great-grandmother. She took out the sheet of paper from
the envelope and began to read.</p>

<p>My Love</p>

<p>I miss you so much... I wish you could be here with me forever.
 	How is your son? I wish he were ours... even though I know that
is
 	Impossible even if we could be together. Why? Why can we not
 	be together? I know we are the perfect couple even though you
 	are married with that man! How I hate him! I am sorry, I know
 	you love him too. You must visit me here at my new home in
 	Boston. I do not think anyone really know about what we did, but
 	this, I know is the best way. The address is at the other side
of this
 	letter... I love you, but we both know our love will never be
 	accepted by anyone. </p>

<p>Promise me that you will never love anyone as you love me.</p>

<p>Yours Julie </p>

<p>Ally stepped up beside Ling. "What's that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I... I don't know." Ling answered looking puzzled. "I think this letter
was meant for my grandmother. It's the right address and her name."</p>

<p>"What does it says?" Ally asked curious.</p>

<p>"I... I... think it is a love letter."</p>

<p>"Really? Wow. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"It's a she." Ling replied half-dazed.</p>

<p>"Hello? Ling? Are you alright?" Ally called out with a worried look.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Ally with a strange smile. "It appears that I'm not the only
one who's gay in my family."</p>

<p>"Good or bad?" Ally asked a bit worried.</p>

<p>"What?" Ling asked, she hadn't heard Ally.</p>

<p>"I asked if it was good or bad. For us I mean."</p>

<p>"This won't change anything we have between us." Ling ensured Ally with a
smile. She gave Ally a short hug and then said, "I love you."</p>

<p>Ally looked back with an unsure look. "Are you sure?" she asked.</p>

<p>Ling simply smiled back, nodded and kissed Ally lightly.</p>

<p>Smiling back after the kiss Ally commented, "That was a yes, right?"</p>

<p>Ling nodded, "Yes do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I love you too." Ally replied.</p>

<p>"Ehrm..." a voice interrupted them.</p>

<p>Ally and Ling broke apart embarrassed. They both straightened their
clothes.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Ally asked with an embarrassed smile.</p>

<p>"Are you going to buy anything or are you just using my store as a place
for your escapades?" the old man asked them with a stern look. "If you
aren't going to buy anything then please leave." he said with the same
tone.</p>

<p>Ling looked down on the book she was holding. "Well, I want to know who you
got this book from." Ling handed the book to the storekeeper.</p>

<p>The keeper took the book and looked at it. "Why do you want to know that?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I believe that my grandmother owned it. I found a letter addressed to
her in it." Ling replied.</p>

<p>"Oh... Well let me check it in my computer."</p>

<p>"Computer?" Ally asked. "Sorry, but it takes away some of the feeling
when you know there is a computer here." she explained when the man looked
at her.</p>

<p>He smiled at her and replied, "Yes I know, that's why I keep it in my
office."</p>

<p>He showed them into a small room filled with old books and papers. "Please
excuse me for the mess. I'm in the middle of catalogize a new shipment I
got yesterday."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>The storekeeper hit the 'on' button on an old computer and waited for a
minute for it to start the operative system. He smiled at them and said,
"It's an old IBM 486 PC, not that I need anything better."</p>

<p>"It doesn't do anything." Ally replied. "I'm not that much into computers
myself."</p>

<p>"You should turn to this guy." Ling said, holding a card in her hand. "he
can help you get a new computer for only 500 dollars or even lower." she
added.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling, surprised she said, "You amazes me all the time. Do
you have a computer store to?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My brother runs it." Ling replied.</p>

<p>Before they could continue the old man interrupted. "Ah, here it is. I
bought it in 1955 in a garage sale. The man I bought it from is named John
Woo."</p>

<p>"That's my uncle." Ling exclaimed, now sure the book had been her
grandmother's. "What does the book cost? I want to buy it."</p>

<p>"Well... The book isn't that rare so you can have it for 100 dollars."</p>

<p>"You got a deal old man."</p>

<p>Ling paid the storekeeper and then they left the store. Back in Ally's
apartment they checked the old book closer. </p>

<p>"I recognize this book." Ally stated. "Look. It's part two." she got up
from the couch and went for her closet. When she came back she held a book
in her hands and had a triumphing smile. "Look. This is part one." Ally
opened the book and showed the inside of the cover. "See what it says." she
said as she pointed at some rows of text written there.</p>

<p>Ling read the words loud. "Dear love of my heart. I give you this book as a
sign of my love for you. Your love." she looked up at Ally. "Who wrote it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I asked my grandma once when she gave me the book. She
didn't know but believed it to be her father who had written it." Ally
replied.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. See it says the same here but it is a different
handwriting." Ling showed the inside of her book's cover.</p>

<p>"There's a name there too... 'Julie'."</p>

<p>"There was an address on the other side of the letter." Ling added. "It
says, **a street in Boston** anything you recognize?"</p>

<p>"Yeah... That's where my grandma grew up." Ally looked down at Ling.
"What's Julie's surname?"</p>

<p>"Barslow."</p>

<p>"That's my grandma's maiden name!" Ally replied shocked. She looked at
Ling. "D-d-do you think they were..." she couldn't finish her sentence.</p>

<p>Ling looked back at her with the same shocked look. "I-I don't know. I
can't believe that my great-grandma actually cheated on her husband..."
ling shook her head.</p>

<p>"If they were... Can you imagine how it must have been for them then?"
Ally had sat down beside Ling, to shocked to stand up.</p>

<p>"We're lucky, I think it was illegal back then when they lived."</p>

<p>"Yeah..." Ally looked at Ling. "I have thought about one thing..."</p>

<p>"What?" Ling looked back curious.</p>

<p>"Well, we asked Renee to be quiet about us being a couple..." Ally
hesitated a little. "When do you think we should tell our friends at the
office?"</p>

<p>"I..." Ling thought for a moment. "I think we should tell them as soon as
we can."</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling with a hesitant look. "Are you sure? I mean I agree
somehow, but are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, mostly because our great-grandparent's love had to be a secret. I
feel that we somehow owe them to tell the world about us." Ling replied.</p>

<p>Ally thought over Ling's reply for a short time then answered, "You are
right." giving her a small smile she asked, "So when?"</p>

<p>Ling looked at her watch. "Well, it's only a half hour past lunch. Maybe to
night at the pub?"</p>

<p>"Sounds perfect to me." Ally's belly gave away a low sound. Slightly
embarrassed she said, "I-I think I'm hungry or at least my tummy is."</p>

<p>Ling smiled amused at her when her own stomach gave away a similar sound.
"I think I'm starved too." she commented her own belly's noises.</p>

<p>"Eat here or out?"</p>

<p>"Out. I can't wait for us to cook food. To be honest, I'm not so good at
cooking either." Ling replied. She got a thought in her mind and looked at
Ally with a questioning look, "Can we call this our second date or should
we call it our first real date?"</p>

<p>"Well we did everything you normally do on dates. We had dinner, we
talked, we danced, and you followed me to my door, well almost to my door.
You even gave me a kinda good night kiss."</p>

<p>"Yeah... I remember that kiss. I wanted to kiss you on your mouth but was
afraid you didn't want me to so I did the second best, I kissed you on your
cheek." Ling smiled at Ally.</p>

<p>"Oh..." Ally smiled back with a mischievous grin. "I wouldn't mind you
kissing me anywhere at all."</p>

<p>Ling didn't answer, just smiled at Ally leand over and kissed her gently on
her lips. When they ended the kiss she asked, "Where do we go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know a perfect place some blocks down street." Ally replied with
some excitement in her voice. "It's a sweet place to eat at. And they have
the best pasta I know."</p>

<p>"I don't know, I don't like pasta."</p>

<p>"This one, you will definitely like." Ally said trying to convince Ling
to eat there.</p>

<p>"Okay. Let's go." Ling decided and they left the apartment and went to
the nice, small italian restaurant.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "You were right. This pasta is really nice." Ling stated after they had
finished eating.</p>

<p>"I told you so." Ally replied with a smile.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Ally. "I think I would want to have some new clothes for
tonight. Wanna go shopping with me?"</p>

<p>"Why not? I need some stuff too." Ally replied. "Where do you buy your
clothes?"</p>

<p>"Mostly at a small store named Leigh's closet." **Is this a workable name
for a clothes shop?** Ling replied, curious to why Ally wanted to know.</p>

<p>"You do? I do that too." Ally said. "Wonder why we haven't met there
before."</p>

<p>Ling smiled at her. "You have exeptional good taste." Ling saw a question
form on Ally's lips and answered before she asked it, "My sister Leigh is
the manager and owner for that store. She is the only one I ask for advice
when I buy clothes. If you buy clothes there you simply must have good
taste."</p>

<p>"Thanks. You too." Ally smiled, she took up her purse and looked in it.
"This lunch is on me." she said as she put some money beside the receipt.</p>

<p>"Thanks for this late lunch." Ling said as they left the restaurant.</p>

<p>Ally looked surprised at Ling. "You thanking for being treated lunch?"</p>

<p>"Yeah..." Ling saw Ally's look and added, "What?"</p>

<p>"It's unusual to hear you say thank you." Ally replied. "I liked that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I only thanks those I deem worthy of it."</p>

<p>"Am I worthy?"</p>

<p>"Yes you are." Ling answered taking Ally's hand. She noticed how nice it
felt to hold Ally's hand. "Take a cab or walk?" Ling asked.</p>

<p>"I'm too stuffed to walk, let´s take a cab."</p>

<p>Ling called out to a cab that just had dropped off an old couple outside of
the restaurant. They stepped in and Ling told the driver where they wanted
to go.</p>

<p>They stepped outside a store that looked very nice from the outside. The
store-window had a couple of mannequins wearing beutiful modern clothes.
When they stepped inside they saw Leigh sitting behind the counter eating a
sallad.</p>

<p>As Leigh looked up she said, "Sorry but it's closed for lunch." When she
saw it was her sister she got a smile and stood up to greet her and Ally.
"Hi." she said and leaned over the counter to give Ling a hug.</p>

<p>"Hi sis. You know Ally." Ling said as they hugged.</p>

<p>Ally stuck out her hand and Leigh took it as they greeted. "I know. She's a
regular here."</p>

<p>"Yeah she told me." Ling commented.</p>

<p>"So what do you want?" Leigh asked after they had greeted.</p>

<p>"A new top and panties." Ling replied. She looked over at Ally waiting
for her to tell what she wanted.</p>

<p>"I need some new panty hose." Ally said, showing up four fingers to show
how many she wanted.</p>

<p>"Same as usual?" Ally nodded in response. "I get them as soon as I am
finished helping my sis." Leigh said as she moved her attention back to her
sister. "Are you two going to some meeting after lunch?" she asked as she
went over to some sweaters.</p>

<p>"No, why?" Ling asked as she followed.</p>

<p>"Well why are you together then? I can't recall you two ever been
together."</p>

<p>"So what? Can't I have new friends?" Ling snapped at her sister.</p>

<p>"Uh... Of course you can have, but you usually don't unless they are
forced on you." Leighs answer made Ally giggle. Ling growled at her sister
and girlfriend.</p>

<p>"You really know your sister well." Ally commented when she finished
giggling. "We were kinda forced together by our bosses. Ouch!" Ally stoped
as she got an elbow in her stomac. Recieving a warning look from Ling she
continued anyway, "Um... Our fighting made the office a battlefield,
lowering the efficiency of the firm."</p>

<p>Leigh laughed. "That sounds like my sis." she said as she steped out of
reach from Ling's fists. "What were you fighting about?"</p>

<p>Before Ally could answer, Ling interrupted and said, "We were fighting
about who had the best taste."</p>

<p>Leigh looked at Ling for amoment, then with a suspicious voice said, "Why
don't I believe you?"</p>

<p>Ally looked sanctimonious, "We did not..." she began to say but was
interrupted by Ling.</p>

<p>"Ally, I don't want her to know yet."</p>

<p>"Why not? Is it because she's family?" Ally asked with an irritated
voice.</p>

<p>"What? Are you gay or something?" Leigh asked. When neither Ally or Ling
answered her she laughed nervously, "Y-you are joking with me right?"</p>

<p>Ling shook her head and replied, "No, I'm in love with... Ally."</p>

<p>"So that's why you are here both of you?" Leigh asked and both of them
nodded in response. "Did you sleep over at her place last night?" Leigh
added.</p>

<p>"Yeah, how did you know that?"</p>

<p>"I called you but you never answered or called back."</p>

<p>"Oh... Why?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to show you my latest design."</p>

<p>"What kind of design?" Ling asked looking curious.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling with an astonished look. Ling noticed it and asked,
"What?"</p>

<p>"You are so different from the Ling at the office."</p>

<p>"So? At work I have to be tough, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing." Ally smiled. "I fell in love with 'tough Ling' but I think
I like 'nice Ling' better."</p>

<p>"As long as you love anyone of my selves." Ling smiled back. She turned
her head toward her sister. "I'm busy tonight, but I think I'm free
tomorrow." she looked at Ally for confirmation.</p>

<p>"I have to work late tomorrow, so I'll be busy." Ally said.</p>

<p>"Okay, tomorrow night then?" Leigh asked as she showed Ling the sweater
she had taken from the table.</p>

<p>Ling looked at it. "It's beutiful!" she exclaimed with a small sigh. She
took it from her sister and showed it for Ally. "It will fit me perfectly
don't you think?"</p>

<p>"I can clearly se you being very cute in that one." Ally replied with a
small smile, surprised how different Ling was here compared to how she
usually acted at the firm.</p>

<p>"I go and try it out." Ling said as she went towards a couple of small
box sized locker rooms.</p>

<p>As Ling changed Leigh looked at Ally, her look changed from a nice look to
a suspicious look. "If you hurt my sister at all..." she threatened Ally.</p>

<p>"I don't inted to hurt her at all." Ally replied, slightly offended.</p>

<p>"You better not." Leigh muttered as Ling stepped out of the box.</p>

<p>Ling stood in front of Ally and Leigh. The sweater followed her lines
perfectly as if it were a second skin. It looked simply gorgeous on her as
she turned around to show it from other angles.</p>

<p>Ally grasped loudly as she saw Ling come out. She couldn't take her eyes
off Ling's upper body part.</p>

<p>Ling walked up close to Ally and whispered in her ear, "I see you like it."
Ally could only nodd in response. Ling looked at her sister. "I take this
one, sis." she said and then added, "I don't need you to protect me. I can
take care of my self." and with that revealed she had heard her sister's
warning towards Ally.</p>

<p>As her sister looked sanctimonious as she took a new sweater and put it in
a bag. "I just don't want her to hurt you." Leigh said as she handed the
bag to Ling.</p>

<p>"She won't hurt me." Ling said but didn't seem to convince her sister. "I
promise. We will probably love eachother until our deaths."</p>

<p>"For her best, I hope you're right." Leigh replied as Ally and Ling
stepped out of the shop.</p>

<p>As the stood outside of the store Ally looked sadly at Ling. "I don't think
your sister likes me anymore."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry. She is like that towards all my boy... partners." Ling
looked at her watch. "I need to get home. Wanna come?"</p>

<p>Ally looked at her won watch. "Yes, but I have some stuff to do myself. See
you at the pub six o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Sure." As they sat down in the cab Ling asked, "Should we meet outside
or inside?"</p>

<p>"Inside. We don't have to tell them until we are inside. And besides I
would like to see their reaction when we greet eachother with a kiss." Ally
replied with a content smile.</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me." Ling said as the cab drove off towards Ally's
apartment.</p>
