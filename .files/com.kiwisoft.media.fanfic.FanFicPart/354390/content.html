<!-- It All Depends On Your Timing \ Part 3 -->

<p>Angel groaned softly, spitting dirt and grass bits as he slowly
pushed up on his hands, shaking off a thick coating of dirt and small stones. He lay at
the midway point of a plumed earthen mountain, actually, partially buried in it if he was
honest about it. The vampire heard a soft scraping sound and twisted in time to see Giles
scrambling out from under a thick coating of debris at the bottom of the unnatural
mountain.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; the librarian called up as he struggled free
of the rubble. &quot;I'll admit that may have been something other than an
earthquake.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel bit back on a sarcastic reply as he pushed to his feet.
Fighting with Giles wouldn't help the situation. He was just debating his options when a
ground shaking bellow rattled up from below.</p>

<p>&quot;MELVINATHORAXISTHULIXIS!!! I'M GOING TO CARVE YOU INTO A
THOUSAND BITS AND FEED YOU TO THE FIRST LEVEL DUST DEMONS!!!!&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Oh God,&quot; Buffy groaned as she saw their pursuer, his
broad form filling the remains of the rock corridor about fifty yards from their position.
The going was tight, so he was moving slowly, tearing out stones in his furious drive to
get to them. &quot;Doesn't he ever give up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not something Enforcer demons are known for,&quot;
Melvin yelped, then reached above himself, scrambling for a hold in a panicked effort to
escape.</p>

<p>Buffy latched her hands around Willow's waist, hefting her upward
with the barked order, &quot;Climb!&quot;</p>

<p>The witch's fingers scrabbled on rock, bringing a shower of small
stones down without getting a good hold.</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't you have put in stairs?&quot; Melvin panted as his
own efforts to climb brought more debris down on their heads. &quot;Because this isn't
working.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; Willow groused. &quot;I've never done this
before. I don't quite have all the details down pat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about some kind of levitation spell?&quot; Buffy demanded
as she was forced to drop Willow's feet back to earth.</p>

<p>The hacker glanced back. &quot;Even if I knew one,&quot; she exhaled
shaking her head. &quot;There's no way.&quot; She could barely concentrate well enough to
stay on her feet. Another spell was out of the question.</p>

<p>The Enforcer demon was still moving toward them, plowing through
rock with terrifying determination.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy!&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer's eyes lifted until she spotted the figure at the lip of
the mound of dirt that had formed around the hole. &quot;Angel!&quot; she yelled up.
&quot;We need a rope down here.&quot;</p>

<p>The vampire looked around himself, then shook his head. &quot;I
don't have one!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great,&quot; the Slayer muttered under her breath and glanced
back at the roaring, screaming thing clawing its way toward them. &quot;Where's the Rope
Fairy when you need one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe I<i> can</i> come up with some kind of spell,&quot;
Willow filled in nervously. &quot;After all, necessity is the mother of invention.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Melvin!!&quot; Stelladvoratrellundar's dusty crimson beehive
appeared above the edge of the hole and she waved down with black tipped fingernails.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a little busy right now, honey!&quot; the demon shouted
back, his eyes locked on the gnarled black doom headed their way. &quot;And probably going
to be even busier dying in just a moment,&quot; he whimpered.</p>

<p>The Enforcer demon clawed through the last layer of dirt and rock,
freeing its warped muscular body and laughing as it saw the terror on the faces of its
intended victims. &quot;Time to die,&quot; the thing snarled, dropping its voice to a low
octave vibration that set the Slayer's hair on end. Still laughing, it stepped forward.</p>

<p>And was suddenly pulled up short as its massive rack of gnarled and
twisted horns caught in the rocks. &quot;AGHH!!!!&quot; the thing grunted as it twisted,
trying to free the snarled mess.</p>

<p>&quot;Too busy for this?&quot; Stella called down, her words greeted
by the heavy clanking of chains tumbling downward. Each link was as big around as Buffy's
wrist.</p>

<p>&quot;Demons, I'll never complain about her fondness for sex toys
ever again,&quot; Melvin said happily, and grabbed Willow, all but tossing her high onto
the chains, before grabbing the Slayer and doing likewise.</p>

<p>Buffy considered asking, then decided she didn't want to know and
just kept climbing.</p>

<p>The Enforcer demon was still fighting with his tangled horns, and
howling as he tried to get to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Buh bye,&quot; the incubus taunted with a smile and a tiny
wave as he mounted the thick chains, climbing them with ease.</p>

<p>&quot;MELVINATHORAXISTHULIXIS!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The links were so huge that the two girls climbed quickly and soon
Willow's hand was grabbed by Angel and he hauled her to safety. A brief second later Buffy
landed next to her friend, and their gazes briefly locked. Both girls froze for a moment.</p>

<p>&quot;True Love's Kiss,&quot; Buffy whispered almost inaudibly as
she remembered the moment of realization that had passed between them.</p>

<p>Willow's voice was very small as she whispered. &quot;I didn't
imagine that either then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Buffy confirmed, swallowing hard as she started to
say more. She broke off abruptly as a massive hand clawed over the edge of the pit,
digging into the ground and leaving deep furrows as it skidded back toward the broken
hole.</p>

<p>&quot;I could use a little help here,&quot; Melvin gasped as he
tried to claw his way from the chain, the other end of which was still held tightly in
Stella's massive fists.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like you've been having a bad day, lover boy,&quot; the
succubus snapped, then flashed a glare toward Willow. &quot;I guess that's what you get
for consorting with virgins.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aw, come on, Stell,&quot; Melvin pleaded between grunts of
effort. &quot;Nothing happened. She's still human as the day she was born.&quot; He slid
back another few inches even as Buffy grabbed for his arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Help me,&quot; she grunted to Angel, who stood uncertainly at
the sidelines.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Buffy--&quot; the vampire began hesitantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Just do it!&quot; the Slayer bit out, while Willow lunged
forward, grabbing Melvin's arm alongside Buffy.</p>

<p>In the pit below, the Enforcer demon finally forced its way free of
the caverns, breaking off both rock and twisted horns in its desperation to get to its
target.</p>

<p>&quot;Help,&quot; Melvin squawked as his assailant lunged at the
chain, scrambling after him.</p>

<p>&quot;We've got to get him up,&quot; Buffy growled as she felt Angel
grab the demon's other arm, adding his strength to the effort. Suddenly, Melvin popped up
over the edge of the hole, and went sprawling, a broad arm thrown across the two girls.</p>

<p>&quot;Let go of the chain, Stell!&quot; the incubus shouted as he
scrambled clear.</p>

<p>The succubus opened thick knuckled hands, landing on her
considerable backside as the heavy chain rattled away from her, disappearing into the
depths of the pit. A brief moment later, a heavy thud echoed through the night followed by
a string howled curses that were profound in their obscenity.</p>

<p>Buffy leaned over the edge of the sharp cliff, easily spotting the
enraged demon. &quot;I don't think he's having a good day,&quot; she said not unhappily.</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't happen to a nicer guy,&quot; Melvin observed.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw, gee, I dunno,&quot; Willow cracked, &quot;there must be
someone somewhere who's nastier, uglier, and smellier.&quot;</p>

<p>The three looked at each other, and shook their heads in rhythm.
&quot;Nah,&quot; they agreed in unison.</p>

<p>Then Buffy turned to face Willow, brushing a gentle finger along her
dirt smudged cheek. &quot;Hey, Wicca-Girl,&quot; she spoke just loudly enough to be heard
over the roaring, fuming creature below.</p>

<p>Angel stared at them all with a confused expression. &quot;Um,
Buffy,&quot; he said at last as he was shouldered aside by a fast moving
Stelladvoratrellundar, who leapt into her demonic boyfriend's arms.</p>

<p>&quot;So you didn't deflower her, lovemuffin?&quot; the beehived
succubus demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;I was never even tempted,&quot; Melvinathoraxisthulixis
assured her. Sometimes a lie is better--and certainly healthier--than the truth, then the
two began trading affectionate small talk that would have made most diabetics more than a
little ill, their voices nearly indistinguishable as they whispered back and forth.
&quot;I love you pooky...but, I love you more, demon-ears...you're my life,
devil-buns...you say the sweetest things, my little succy-wuccy...&quot;</p>

<p>Luckily for their mental health, no one was listening. The Slayer
spun to face her sometimes boyfriend. &quot;Angel,&quot; she squeaked. &quot;I...we...that
is...Willow and I...&quot;</p>

<p>The vampire brushed past her, his manner borderline gruff, making
the slightly ambiguous meaning of his words obvious. &quot;I already know about it. Giles
told me.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow both flamed bright red. &quot;Oh,&quot; the Slayer
exhaled as Angel leaned over the edge of the pit, getting a look at the creature raging
below, then turned a blank look toward Melvin. &quot;What happened down there?&quot; he
asked Buffy at last.</p>

<p>Melvin broke away from his demon lover as he turned to face Angel
and offered a hand for a comradely shake. &quot;Well,&nbsp; it's kind of a long
story,&quot; he boomed with a friendly smile. &quot;But, if you like, we can share a beer
afterwards and trade a few stories.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel eyed the demon and then the huge hand offered his way and then
turn his gaze back toward his former lover. &quot;Buffy?&quot; he said a little
helplessly.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a long story,&quot; the Slayer admitted with a shrug.</p>

<p>Concluding no shake was coming, Melvin peered back over the edge of
the pit and blanched to a soft pastel pink. &quot;Uh oh,&quot; he squeaked. &quot;We've
got a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>The others followed the line of his gaze, all of them losing color
as they saw the Enforcer demon methodically pounding stairsteps into the magic-made cliff
walls.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not good,&quot; Buffy muttered, then shook her head
violently as she was suddenly doused in flakes of sage. The Slayer spun around just as
Rupert Giles came scrambling up the steep slope of the rock mound, an ancient text in one
hand, a copper pot of herbs balanced neatly on the open pages.</p>

<p>&quot;I banish you, Melvinathoraxisthulixis, to the nether
realms,&quot; He shouted between gagging coughs and flung another handful of herbs from
the pot, before lapsing into Latin, his powerful voice ringing across the night, though
hardly loud enough to be heard above the thing steadily pounding its way out of the pit.</p>

<p>&quot;Not now, Giles,&quot; the Slayer said impatiently. The first
one to break out of the momentary paralysis that seemed to have struck the small group,
she stormed toward her Watcher, grabbing his pot of assorted herbs and snapping the book
shut with a short-tempered, &quot;That's really not necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>Her Watcher stared blankly at her. &quot;But, Buffy,&quot; and then
a look of suspicion settled over his features and he backed off a half step. &quot;Exactly
what happened down there?&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer sighed as the ground shuddered beneath her feet. &quot;I
found Melvinathoraxisthulixis,&quot; and Buffy was impressed that she actually managed to
pronounce it correctly, or at least she thought she had.</p>

<p>And then the Enforcer demon got a monstrous black arm up over the
edge of the pit and began dragging itself up.</p>

<p>&quot;And then we all found something even worse,&quot; she added as
she spun back toward the fight, bounding back toward where the others were quickly
scrambling away from the pit. &quot;How do we fight it?!&quot; she demanded of Melvin,
grabbing his arm to keep him from bolting.</p>

<p>The demon's gold eyes were wide with terror. &quot;Fight?&quot; he
repeated disbelievingly. &quot;An Enforcer demon? You've gotta be kidding.&quot; His voice
cracked with sheer terror, while Stella pulled on his other arm. &quot;You don't fight an
Enforcer demon! You run away from an Enforcer demon! Preferably very quickly!&quot; he
explained as though she wasn't the sharpest stake in the weapons collection.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, honey,&quot; Stella urged as she grabbed Melvin's
arm. &quot;Tell the nice little demon fodder it was nice meeting her, but the party's over
and it's time to go.&quot;</p>

<p>And then the Enforcer demon bounded up over the edge of the pit,
landing on top of the mounded earth on its feet and knuckles, like some twisted, hellborne
gorilla. Angel stepped forward as if to block the thing, but it batted him aside like an
annoying mosquito and he landed a dozen yards from the base of the newly made mountain
sprawled and unmoving.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; the Slayer snarled as she spun to face the
thing. &quot;Now, you've pissed me off.&quot;</p>

<p>The Enforcer demon's mouth twisted in what might have been a
smile--though Buffy was far from certain--and made a snuffling sort of laughing sound.
&quot;I haven't squashed a human like a bug in ages,&quot; it said, the words not quite
matching the mouth movements, making for a sight vaguely reminiscent of a bad Japanese
monster movie. &quot;Thank you for giving me the opportunity to have a little fun on this
assignment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; Willow shouted and lunged forward as she saw the
thing's massive fists lift. She tackled into Buffy and they both went tumbling even as the
beast's arms fell and thudded into the ground in their wake.</p>

<p>&quot;NO SPLAT,&quot; the thing snarled unhappily and lifted its
arms to try again. This time there was no way the girls could get out of the way in time.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw heaven,&quot; Melvin growled and lunged between them,
blocking the swing with a heavy arm, then threw a heaving punch that connected solidly
with the Enforcer's jaw. The blow would have left the average human in pieces, and even
the Slayer would have suffered more than a few broken bones if hit with the power behind
the Melvin's punch.</p>

<p>The other demon never even flinched.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this is bad,&quot; the incubus breathed.</p>

<p>The Enforcer demon laughed again. &quot;You're pathetic,
Melvinathoraxisthulixis, consorting with humans, thinking yourself in love.&quot; The
thing snorted, nodding its uneven jaw toward Stella. &quot;And with a succubus who
couldn't seduce a customer in a whorehouse if she started offering freebies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; the demoness shouted, raising balled fists.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, there's no need to get insulting,&quot; Melvin said,
backing up a half step. Violence hadn't worked so he was inclined to try negotiation.</p>

<p>Willow scrambled free of the tangle of Buffy's arms and legs,
skidding and clambering toward Giles, who was flipping desperately through his book.
&quot;An Enforcer demon,&quot; she panted as she reached the Watcher. &quot;We need a
spell for banishing an Enforcer demon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know if there even is such a thing,&quot; the
librarian responded, still hunting desperately. Willow glanced back just in time to see
the huge black demon backhand the incubus.</p>

<p>Melvin's massive body was momentarily airborne, then slammed into
the earth with bone shattering force. &quot;Aw, man, that smarts,&quot; the demon groaned
and lifted his head unsteadily. &quot;I gotta learn how to do this fighting thing.&quot;</p>

<p>The Enforcer demon glanced back at its most recent victim, snorting
as though amused, then turned its attention toward Stella. &quot;And now you,
Stelladvoratrellundar,&quot; the thing growled throatily. &quot;Shall we dance?&quot;</p>

<p>The succubus giggled in nervous terror, then bolted, bounding around
their assailant toward her demonic boyfriend.</p>

<p>The Enforcer demon only laughed. &quot;I'll deal with both of you
soon enough,&quot; it said as it turned its attention toward the humans who stood so
close. &quot;I've always loved that little splat mortals make when they die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Willow, Giles, run!&quot; Buffy ordered with a glance over her
shoulder as she stepped between the creature and her friends. She was on her own now. The
Slayer braced herself, drawing her hands up into a fighting position, fully intending to
stop the thing at least long enough for Willow and Giles to escape.</p>

<p>Giles was hunting even harder when Willow suddenly grabbed the book
from him, flipping through it with an unusual sense of confidence. It was like a flash of
knowledge as she suddenly understood what she was looking for.</p>

<p>The demon paused, eyeing Buffy as it chuckled once again, the sound
dark and ugly. &quot;So, you're the Slayer...vampires are such a weakling breed of
demon...so I'm not surprised their Slayer is as well.&quot;</p>

<p>Eyes flashing angrily, Buffy's lips turned up in a sneer. &quot;And
yet, you still stand there, while I still stand here,&quot; she taunted. &quot;One could
almost think you weren't in a hurry for our little face off.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow flipped desperately through the pages of the ancient
spellbook, ignoring Giles' demands to know what she was doing refusing to let him take it
back. &quot;I know I've seen it here somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>The beast laughed, the sound booming across the night. &quot;You
think I fear you?&quot; it demanded of Buffy, then chortled again. &quot;A creature that
can't even beat up a punkling incubus.&quot; It brought up a huge, misshapen hand, curling
the gnarled fingers into a fist. &quot;SPLAT!&quot; it pronounced very clearly as it
readied to swing.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't do that!&quot; Willow shouted as she lunged
forward, the ancient spellbook still held firmly in her hands.</p>

<p>Buffy chanced a glance back, her expression bordering on panic.
&quot;Willow, go!&quot; she hissed desperately, but the hacker didn't budge an inch, just
straightened her shoulders as she glanced down at the book in her hands and then back up
again.</p>

<p>&quot;And now another child threatens me,&quot; the Enforcer demon's
voice rumbled low in its throat. &quot;What's your plan, little girl, bore me into
submission?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow swallowed hard, forcing down the sudden sense of panic as the
demon's eyes pinned her in place. Intending to face an Enforcer demon and actually facing
an Enforcer demon were two very different things. She straightened her shoulders, eyes
narrowing as she tried her best to look threatening, despite the fact that Buffy kept
hissing at her to leave. &quot;No,&quot; she said with as much bravado as she could
muster. &quot;I-I'm going to banish you back to hell.&quot; She held up the book clumsily.
&quot;And I have the spell right here...&quot; She gulped a breath to continue. &quot;And,
you should know that I'm considered a very badass Wiccan.&quot;</p>

<p>The beast's oversized, slobbering lips lifted in some kind of a
smile. &quot;I almost regret making you go splat,&quot; it mused. &quot;You're
funny.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You think I can't do it?&quot; Willow demanded, still trying
to look braver than she felt. &quot;You-you're going to regret that...I'm going to banish
you now.&quot;</p>

<p>The creature snorted. &quot;I haven't been successfully banished
since the first Caesar ruled the known world,&quot; it sneered.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh...well...we'll just see about that,&quot; the Wiccan as she
looked down at her book. Her voice lifted, the Latin words sliding from her lips in
stumbling syllables. She tried to concentrate, used the herbs in the pot, which were more
or less what she needed, and pronounced the words.</p>

<p>While the demon laughed at her.</p>

<p>It was not an auspicious beginning and resulted in a disgustingly
predictable ending.</p>

<p>When Willow finished, there was no crack of thunder, no explosion,
no hands reached up from the netherworld to drag the Enforcer demon back into hell. What
actually happened was nothing. Not a damn thing. The demon still stood there, still calmly
laughing at her when she finished.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow, go,&quot; Buffy ordered and grabbed her shoulder,
pushing her friend out of the way as she stepped in to face the demon. &quot;Save
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow stumbled backward, falling over her own feet and hitting one
knee to watch in horror as the Slayer somehow ducked a heaving fist then fought back with
a flying roundhouse that had absolutely no effect on the beast. She recovered quickly and
bounded straight up, the air foil from the creature's swing unbalancing her and nearly
sending her sprawling without even making contact.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't have a prayer. Sooner or later, one of the Enforcer
demon's fists would make contact and then the Slayer was as good as dead.</p>

<p>Willow pushed to her feet, wildly flipping through the book, hunting
for some kind of answer even as her friend was coming closer and closer to Splatdom. It
wasn't working she realized with a sick rush. She wasn't going to find it in time.</p>

<p>And then the demon's fist caught Buffy in a glancing blow and
slammed her hard into the ground. Badly winded, the girl could barely push up on her
hands. She braced an arm across her ribs, fighting for air as she sensed the demon drawing
close.</p>

<p>A huge black fist lifted. &quot;Splat,&quot; the creature chuckled
as it readied to squash the Slayer.</p>

<p>&quot;NO!&quot; Willow screamed. She couldn't let that happen. It
simply wasn't an option.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the beast disagreed and his fist started to fall.</p>

<p>Willow never knew what she said, what incantation fell from her
lips, or even if one did. It might have been that she only screamed mindlessly, the sheer
emotion of her voice propelling the spell forward. In any event, even the Enforcer demon
froze as a tornado seemed to whip up around the girl, while lightning flared and sparked
around her narrow frame, the bright blue-white fingers touching and caressing pale skin.</p>

<p>And then all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh shit,&quot; the Enforcer demon said. They were to be his
last words.</p>

<p>Then Buffy rolled onto her stomach, bracing her arm protectively
across her face as heat and light exploded over her head.</p>

<p>It didn't last long--timed on a stopwatch, only a few paltry seconds
would have been recorded--but it felt like a century for the tiny group gathered outside
the long abandoned Yugo dealership. Like a lightning bolt, it flicked out in a
millisecond, leaving a scattered after-image imprinted on every remaining eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow?&quot; Buffy groaned as she pushed up on her hands and
twisted toward where she had last seen her friend.</p>

<p>The wiccan was on her knees, her head tipped forward on her
shoulders. &quot;Remind me <i>never</i> to do that again,&quot; she groaned with heartfelt
sincerity. If there was a single millimeter of her body that didn't hurt, she had no idea
what it might be. Even her hair was throbbing with pain.</p>

<p>&quot;My God,&quot; Giles exhaled as he scrambled to the girl's
side. &quot;You did it. You banished an Enforcer demon.&quot; He swallowed hard, shaken by
the sheer power required for that sort of an operation.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy groaned and stumbled to her feet. &quot;She
did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes...well...&quot; Giles murmured, visibly shaken. He hooked
a finger under Willow's chin, tipping her head up to stare into her dazed eyes. &quot;Are
you all right?&quot;</p>

<p>Melvin bounded to his feet, pulling away from Stella as he moved to
stare down at the spot where his pursuer had last stood. He knelt, reaching out to trail a
broad crimson finger through the dust. &quot;She wasted him,&quot; the demon exhaled, then
paled to a ghastly shade of pink. &quot;And I kidnapped her,&quot; he whimpered. &quot;If
I ever catch that blond vamp and his nutso girlfriend, I'm going to do something evil to
them...Donny and Marie reruns will probably be involved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She actually banished him,&quot; Buffy mumbled in astonishment
as she staggered over.</p>

<p>The incubus glanced back, golden eyes finding the girl easily in the
faint light. &quot;She didn't banish him,&quot; he whispered in an awestruck voice.</p>

<p>Buffy frowned, tracking Giles out of the corner of her eye as he
checked Willow over. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>Melvin dug a hand into the ground, picking it up and letting it
trail between massive fingers so Buffy could see the pale grey ash. &quot;She destroyed
it.&quot; Where before his whispers had rattled the rafters, this time Buffy had a hard
time hearing him through the shock that had robbed his voice of volume. &quot;She fried an
Enforcer Demon...completely eliminated him except for a tiny bit of ash.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay?&quot; Buffy was nonplused. As far as she was concerned
that was the best course of action when it came to Enforcer demons.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you understand?&quot; Melvin exhaled, still staring at
the fine ash as it floated from his fingertips.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;She's special,&quot; the demon said. &quot;Really
special.&quot; He pushed to his feet, clamping a solid hand on Buffy's shoulder as he
leaned close, his voice dropping even lower. &quot;I've heard stories, but never
seen...never thought I'd see...&quot; He shook his massive head. &quot;There's one Slayer
in a generation...but there's only one of her in a millennium...there are prophecies about
her...important ones....&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's brows drew together in a frown and she swallowed hard,
sensing the world-shattering import of what he was telling her.</p>

<p>&quot;You protect her,&quot; the incubus growled, then shook his
head, backing off as Stella bounded their way. He was scared--Buffy realized in a
rush--really scared.</p>

<p>&quot;Melvin, we really should be going,&quot; she snapped, her eyes
glittering with jealous lights as they fell on Buffy.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, honey,&quot; the incubus agreed, his glitter-gold eyes
still on the Slayer. As Stella curved a hand to his upper arm, he let himself be dragged
away, though he pulled up short to growl at the Slayer, &quot;Remember what I've told
you.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow straightened away from Giles' worried ministrations and
stepped around Buffy's Watcher as she called out, &quot;Melvin.&quot;</p>

<p>The creature turned, pulling his girlfriend up short as he faced the
Wiccan, paling ever so slightly. He backed up a nervous step. &quot;I hope there are no
hard feelings,&quot; he said instantly, then muttered to himself. &quot;Of all the virgins
to kidnap--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay,&quot; Willow said with a small smile. &quot;I know
you didn't have a choice...thanks for helping us.&quot;</p>

<p>The incubus shrugged. &quot;Well, don't expect it to be a habit or
anything like that. Just because I'm in love doesn't mean I'm suddenly one of the good
guys.&quot; Then he glanced at the ashy remains of his demonic pursuer and was reminded of
just how powerful she was. &quot;On the other hand, being a good guy might not be so
bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keep working on it,&quot; Willow suggested. &quot;You might
just make it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's enough goodbyes, now come on, Melvin,&quot; Stella said
insistently and pulled sharply on his arm, yanking her demonic boyfriend out into the
night.</p>

<p>&quot;See ya around, little Willow,&quot; the creature called in his
booming voice as he disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p>A long moment of odd silence followed, broken only by a faint wind.
Finally, Buffy limped over to Willow's side.</p>

<p>&quot;You okay, Wicca-Girl?&quot; the battered young woman
questioned her friend as she reached up to gently trail a hand along the curve of her jaw.</p>

<p>Willow shrugged. &quot;Not at my best,&quot; she admitted shakily,
then leaned her forehead against Buffy's shoulder. &quot;But a lot better than I was...not
being seven foot tall, horned, or demonically possessed works for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, well...for all of us.&quot; Giles inserted himself
between them, all but dragging the two girls apart.</p>

<p>&quot;You all okay?&quot; Angel groaned as he staggered up from
where he'd been tossed. Drying blood stained his face in streamers from his nose and mouth
and a wound in his forehead. &quot;I saw...&quot; he exhaled, then ran a hand through his
hair. &quot;I mean the explosion.&quot; He stared at Willow. &quot;You did that?&quot;</p>

<p>The girl nodded and shrugged, suddenly embarrassed. &quot;I kinda
lost my temper.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel just stared at her, while they were all saved from the need to
comment by the screech that rang across the night.</p>

<p>&quot;You said we'd get the staff!&quot; Drusilla's high pitched
voice berated her partner and the small group turned toward the sound, easily spotting the
pair some distance away.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, dear, that was your plan,&quot; Spike tried to
defend himself, but it was a pointless exercise.</p>

<p>&quot;And then you said we'd get to kill a Slayer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...yes, I was hoping--&quot;</p>

<p>Drusilla struck his chest. &quot;AND NO STAFF AND NO DEAD
SLAYER!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dru, love--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;AND YOU PROMISED!!&quot; she hit him again, then turned and
stomped off. &quot;I don't ever want to see you again if you can't even keep your
promises! I should never have taken you back!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Dru, honey....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Think we should go do something about them?&quot; Buffy
questioned.</p>

<p>Angel shook his head. &quot;Nah, let Dru torture Spike for
awhile...it's a fitting punishment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A tosket, and slashket, Spike's head on a pike on the
wall,&quot; Drusilla sing-songed with absolutely no regard for meter or rhyming.</p>

<p>&quot;Dammit, Dru, stop hitting! I'll find you another bloody way to
walk in sunlight!?&quot; Another slapping sound echoed across the night, followed by
Spike's pained yelp. &quot;There's some kind of a ring I've heard about--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just more of your useless promises!&quot; the vampiress
screamed in a fury as she stalked off into the night.</p>

<p>The last thing the small group heard of the two was Spike's
plaintive voice. &quot;C'mon, Dru, honey...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope they drown in holy water,&quot; Willow muttered
grumpily, then turned a plaintive look toward Buffy. &quot;Home now,&quot; she whimpered
and leaned her forehead against the Slayer's shoulder, exhaustion threatening to send her
to her knees. In a very short span of time she'd cast two spells that should have been
impossible for someone as inexperienced as she was--or someone far more experienced for
that matter. To say the least, it had cost her.</p>

<p>Buffy lifted a hand, stroking soft read hair gently as she turned
her head until her cheek was pressed against Willow's temple. &quot;Soon,&quot; she
promised.</p>

<p>Angel tensed and looked would have looked away, but his eyes locked
with Buffy's as they swept past and they both froze in place, though Buffy continued
tenderly petting Willow's hair. And in that moment, seeing the look in his former lover's
eyes, he knew. Whatever was happening between Buffy and Willow wasn't just youthful
experimentation. It was real and they both knew it. He'd almost forgotten Giles was there
until the librarian stepped forward and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;We should be going,&quot; he said simply, then herded the two
girls toward his car. He paused suddenly and half turned back. &quot;I'm afraid there
isn't really room for all four of us,&quot; he said apologetically and shrugged. &quot;Not
with the books and equipment that also have to be returned to the library.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel knew what the other man was going to ask even before he said
the words.</p>

<p>&quot;Would you mind walking back?&quot; Giles questioned the
vampire coolly.</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Angel's tongue to refuse, but Giles was already
herding his charges toward his car. Moments later, he was left alone as Giles small car
puttered off into the night. Silently, the vampire stuffed his hands in his pockets. If
his heart still beat, it would have been hammering in his chest. He sensed what Giles
intended, at some level, he even knew the other man was probably right, but he was
heartsick. He dragged a hand through his hair telling himself over and over that it was
for the best. Buffy had enough to deal with--as the Slayer, every minor and major demon on
the west coast was after her--without adding the Watchers to her enemy list.</p>

<p>Which was why it was such a surprise several minutes later when he
found himself running, his long legs pumping hard, driven to try and stop what he sensed
was intended for Buffy.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Epilogue</p>

<p>Angel entered the school library on silent feet, little more than a
ghostly shadow, his expression unreadable. The room was unusually quiet; no teenagers
giggling in the stacks, no arguments over who got the jelly donuts, and no discussion
about which demon their prey might be. A muscle flexed in his jaw as he hunted for some
sign of the others, hesitant to call out for reasons he didn't dare give voice to.</p>

<p>So it was a surprise when Giles' disembodied voice spoke,
&quot;You're too late. It's already done.&quot; A heartbeat later, the librarian stepped
from his shadowed office. He looked like Angel felt--hurt, angry, gutpunched.</p>

<p>&quot;You make it sound so simple,&quot; the vampire growled, his
chest feeling more hollow than it had since that first moment when his soul returned to
his body, confused and tormented. &quot;What did you do to them?&quot;</p>

<p>The other man paled slightly and froze; instinctively reacting to
his former torturer or reacting to his own guilt? Angel had no way of knowing.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; the vampire said simply, hands fisting at his
sides as he tried to convince himself that the Watcher would never hurt either girl.</p>

<p>Giles didn't have to ask what Angel was referring to. He already
knew all too well. &quot;It's done,&quot; he growled, hating the feeling burning in his
gut. Even knowing he was only trying to keep them safe, he felt like a rapist for the
first time in his entire life. He took a long swallow from the brandy glass in his hand.
&quot;I made them forget,&quot; he snarled, then waved the glass toward the double doors
to the library. &quot;They left a few minutes ago...none the wiser about their
little...infatuation.&quot; He raked a hand through his hair, leaving it in an
unaccustomed disarray.</p>

<p>&quot;Infatuation?&quot; Angel barked on a disgusted half laugh.
&quot;You do know that the only way to release a chosen from an incubus' spell is with
True Love's kiss, don't you.&quot; He shook his head disgustedly. &quot;Buffy was the only
one down there with Willow and that demon. You do the math.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles paled another notch and tossed back the last of the brandy
before setting the glass aside. He tossed the crystal in his other hand onto the table
next to the glass. He had used it to help hypnotize the two girls, separately, leading
them into his office under the pretense of treating their injuries. Then he'd stripped
their memories, taken them and reconfigured them, rewriting history, rewriting their own
thoughts and feelings. He felt ill. Just touching the crystal he'd betrayed them with made
him want to undo it all and beg for forgiveness. He suddenly realized he'd been silent for
far too long and looked up to see Angel still watching him with that unreadable look.</p>

<p>&quot;Betrayals are a bitch, aren't they?&quot; the vampire drawled
knowingly. The demon in him had taken great joy in doing far worse, while the man had been
left with the guilt of the acts when he'd returned to his own body. &quot;Because no
matter the reason, it never changes what you've done.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles' hands fisted at his sides, his jaw clenching. &quot;It's the
only way to save their lives.&quot; He spun away, fumbling with his glasses to have
something to do with his hands. &quot;The Council would already just as soon see Buffy
dead and a new Slayer in her place...one more...malleable to their interests. And
Willow?&quot; The Watcher turned, facing Angel, the guilt clearly written on his face.
&quot;They've regarded all of you as threats to their control--very likely responsible for
their Slayer's defiant streak--and now she's shown a level of mystical power no one could
have predicted.&quot; Giles shook his head, admitting to himself that he was nearly as
shaken by that discovery as he was by what he'd been forced to do. &quot;They'd consider
her strong enough to be a threat, strong enough to make those prophecies come true, and
they wouldn't hesitate to destroy her. In fact, I suspect they'd consider it the utterly
moral choice.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel spun away, muscles flexing under the skin, disbelief written
on his handsome features. He wasn't a man easily shocked, but Giles was managing to do it.
&quot;And these are the good guys,&quot; he snarled. His eyes landed on the crystal used
to betray the woman he loved.</p>

<p>&quot;If it's any comfort,&quot; Giles said softly, trying to
comfort himself as well as Angel. &quot;They won't know anything's missing. I replaced the
night they...they first kissed with another memory, made them believe that tonight's
little...adventure...was nothing but a kidnapping by Spike and Drusilla...and...reinforced
their feelings for you and Oz.&quot; he didn't add that he'd restructured Willow's
memories of the magic she'd done and subtly discouraged her from trying anything like it
again. Power of that magnitude was dangerous at best.</p>

<p>Angel wondered if that was supposed to somehow buy him off. If it
was, it didn't work. &quot;And what if one of them starts to remember?&quot; he ground
out.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I will do it again,&quot; the Watcher snapped, his own
ragged emotions showing more than he would have wished. &quot;Look, Angel, I don't like
this either. Believe me, hypnotizing Buffy into being even more in love with you would not
be my ideal choice...but under the circumstances--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't, Giles, just don't.&quot; Angel reached out, picking up
the faceted crystal Giles had discarded, dangling it from the delicate gold chain that
fastened to the point of the teardrop. He lifted it as he turned, letting it dangle and
spin on the chain, staring at the delicate facets with inhuman intensity. He made his
decision in an instant. Vampires are mystic creatures with inhuman powers--not so many as
most works of fiction might claim, but more than enough to spare. His voice was soft and
smoothing, his features inhumanly beautiful.</p>

<p>&quot;Angel,&quot; Giles gasped, sensing what the vampire intended,
and pulled away as if to escape. Angel caught him, pinning him against the wall with one
hand as he twisted the chain to make the crystal spin, the delicate facets spilling tiny
splashes of light around the dimly lit room.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes, the safest path isn't the best one,&quot; Angel
whispered. &quot;Buffy and Willow deserve the right to chart their own lives.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles tried to fight the hypnotic spell, but the vampire's skill and
power were far too overwhelming. In moments he was lost.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>Rupert Giles leaned back at his desk and massaged the back of his
neck tiredly as he noted the glowing bit of sunlight gleaming through the tiny window high
on the wall in his office. Thank goodness retrieving Willow from Spike and Drusilla had
gone easier than they all expected, and the girl had been returned home unharmed. He
didn't know what Buffy would have done without her best friend's caring ear and always
practical advice. He peeled off his glasses, polishing them on his shirtsleeve, then
suddenly froze, staring off into space as though there was something he should remember,
but he couldn't quite bring it to the fore. Finally, he shook his head, throwing off the
odd musings that had struck him. He should be happy they'd won a battle for once. He
closed the text he'd started researching after Buffy and Willow had left, frowning
slightly as it occurred to him that he was more tired than he'd realized. He could barely
even remember the night's events. Time to get home and get some rest. The battle with the
mayor still lay ahead of them all.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Angel stood inside the safe protection of his lair. The stench of
the succubus still hung heavy on the air, but it was dulled by the thick smell of alcohol,
and even moreso by the fact that the vampire was rapidly becoming increasingly inebriated.
But the alcohol wouldn't change what had happened or what he'd done. He'd given Buffy and
Willow a chance to find their own future without interference. Or had he? He shook his
head, uncertain he'd be able to turn down the chance with Buffy that Giles' hypnosis had
given him. Finally, he drained the last of the bourbon in the bottle and tossed it aside
before stumbling into his bedroom, hoping to escape the demons chasing through his brain.</p>

<p ALIGN="left">But he wouldn't escape them. And days later, when Joyce
Summers appeared in his home and asked him to leave town, it would almost be a relief to
agree with her that he had to go.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;You okay, Wicca-Girl?&quot; Buffy questioned gently as Willow
joined her at her locker.</p>

<p>The redhead nodded and offered a small smile. &quot;Thanks to
you.&quot; She hitched her backpack a little higher on her shoulder. &quot;Nobody ever had
a better friend.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy laughed. &quot;T'is true,&quot; she agreed, then slung an arm
around Willow's shoulder. &quot;Now, I think it's time we go find that cutie of yours, Oz.
I'm betting he wants to find out his main squeeze is okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow giggled and blushed, her eyes gleaming with adoration at the
mere mention of her boyfriend. &quot;I already called him twice this morning,&quot; she
confided.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, that's the spirit. Unfortunately, I have to wait until
tonight to speak to my main cutie.&quot; Buffy heaved an intentionally overly dramatic
sigh. And if she paused to wonder about the sudden tightness in her stomach at the thought
of Willow and Oz, it was only for the briefest moment. After all, Willow was in love with
Oz...and she was in love with Angel...and all was right with the world...</p>

<p>Right?</p>
