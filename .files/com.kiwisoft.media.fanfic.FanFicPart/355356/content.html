<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Your Little Secret -->

<p>There was something bothering Brooke and it had been bothering
her for a while now. It was nagging at the back of her mind like an annoying
little voice and she was unable to stand it anymore. She was getting angrier and
angrier and didn't want it to get out of her control. So she asked Nicole to
meet her in the Novak later at school one day a week after Prom. </p>
<p>"Nic, we need to talk," Brooke said in a tone that allowed for
no argument. Nicole looked at her surprised at the tone but shrugged.
</p>
<p>"Sure, B. What's on your mind? Is there a sale at Saks I need
to know about?" </p>
<p>"Nic, I'm serious. I need to talk to you about Sam." Something
in Brooke's tone made the hairs on the back of Nicole's neck stand on end. </p>
<p>"Christ, what'd Spam do now?" </p>
<p>"No, Nic, it's about you," Brooke almost growled. Nic's eyes
grew wide for a second in alarm. </p>
<p>"What about me?" she asked defensively as her heart started to
race. Brooke advanced on her dangerously making Nicole back up unconsciously
until she hit the wall of the Novak. </p>
<p>"I know you have feelings for Sam," Brooke announced lowly.
Nicole felt her stomach drop to her knees and her head spin. Brooke was glaring
at her with a fiery intensity that made her squirm. </p>
<p>"Feelings for Spam McPherson? Are you sick?" she nearly
screamed at Brooke in a near panic. Brooke's glare got impossibly hotter.
</p>
<p>"Drop the act, Julian, I'm not buying it. I may be blonde but
I'm not stupid, or blind. You have feelings for Sam, admit it," Brooke
challenged. Nicole blinked at her in shock. </p>
<p>"I?uh?no?" she stuttered. Brooke rolled her eyes and stomped
her foot as she placed her hands on her hips. </p>
<p>"Is that the best you can do?" she taunted angrily. "Here, let
me tell you how I know. Maybe that'll make it easier for you." </p>
<p>"I've noticed the little things, Nicole. The
uncharacteristically nice things you've done for me and Sam. I figured you did
them partially out of guilt for last spring and partially out of obligation from
your friendship with me. But you've grown increasingly protective of Sam. And
after the way you tore into Pierce after he attacked and hurt Sam, well, that
REALLY made me suspicious. So, I've been watching you. And it's become
abundantly clear that you care for her." Nicole just stared at her. </p>
<p>"Jesus, for the sake of what remains of our friendship,
Nicole, for once, be honest with me. Do you have feelings for Sam?" Brooke
asked. Nicole hung her head as a few tears leaked past her eyes. </p>
<p>"Yes," she finally squeaked. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I knew it," she said quietly. "GOD DAMN IT!" she screamed,
punching the wall and making Nicole jump. </p>
<p>"So what are you going to do now, Nic? Huh? You going to go
after her? Try and hurt me so you can have her for yourself? I'm surprised you
haven't tried all ready," Brooke accused bitterly. Nicole's head snapped up in
shock. </p>
<p>"What? How could you think that?" she asked. </p>
<p>"That's what the old Nicole Julian would do. See something you
want and destroy anything that stood between you and it. Let me tell you right
now that you're in for one Hell of a fight," Brooke warned. </p>
<p>"Have you learned nothing in the past year, Brooke?" Nicole
asked, her own anger fueling her now. "I am not `the old Nicole Julian'
anymore." Brooke scoffed. </p>
<p>"Oh really?" Nicole glared at her. </p>
<p>"Really," she stated firmly. "That accident changed a lot more
than you and Sam. If you think it didn't, it must be nice in that little plastic
bubble you live in. I changed too, Brooke. I'm not going after Sam because I
have no right to her. She's YOURS; she loves YOU. She tolerates me, barely.
Aside from those facts, it'd take nothing less than an act of God to separate
the two of you." Brooke eyed her suspiciously but some of the animosity
disappeared from her hazel eyes. </p>
<p>"You're not going to plot and plan to steal her from me?"
Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"I have no right to her, Brooke. She loves you and I'm not
you. Besides, while I may care for her, I doubt that it's love. I don't think
I'm capable of that emotion. It's been bred out of me," she said sadly. Brooke
shook her head. </p>
<p>"Well, I doubt that. But, I appreciate your honesty." Nic
nodded. </p>
<p>"Please don't tell her. And I'm sorry if it bothers you. I
understand if you don't want me around anymore." Brooke shook her head.
</p>
<p>"If you're telling me the truth and you aren't going after
her, then don't worry about it. I will be watching you though and at the first
sign otherwise, Nic," Brooke warned. Nicole smiled sardonically. </p>
<p>"Message received, Brooke. Loud and clear. Sam's yours.
Gotcha." </p>
<p>"Just so long as that's clear," Brooke added. Nicole nodded.
It was very clear. Dasanti and Evian clear even. </p>
