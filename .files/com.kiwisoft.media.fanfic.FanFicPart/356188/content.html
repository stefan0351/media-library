<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 3: The Reproduction Of Death -->

<p>"Listen up my soon to be college drop-outs!" Ms Roberta Glass stood in front of her desk trying to gather her lively bunch of students.</p>
<p>"It accures to me that this class is looking more like a gays rights movement parade rather than an actual biology class." Ms Glass looked over at Sam and Brooke, later at Lilly who rolled her eyes. Just when Lilly was about to open her mouth to comment on that, Ms Glass spoke up again.</p>
<p>"Hear me out before you start nagging Esposito." The bio teacher turned around putting a bunch of papers on the desk.</p>
<p>"The painfully annoying miss Esposito submitted me a written proposition regarding "more influence" in this class's curriculum", Miss Glass gestured quotation marks with her fingers, "as well a suggestion to bring up the subject of in vitro fertilization. At first, I dismissed it as I do all of Esposito's suggestions. However, I am honestly sick and tired of trying to come up with, and I quote miss irksome; 'interesting, fruitful and instructive' subjects that would capture your attention, since more than half of you are going to flunk this class anyway. So, today we are talking about in vitro fertilization."</p>
<p>Lily stared at her teacher with her mouth opened. This was probably the only time Bobbi Glass had agreed on something she had suggested without the ulterior motive to make a complete fool of her in front of the entire class. On the other hand, was she?</p>
<p>"Before we see the movie provided by the lovely people from the state board of education, I am going to run down some simple facts so you know what the heck we're talking about. I think the Mc-Blissfuls should pay extra attention." Ms Glass handed out a sheet to each student with texts and illustrations. Brooke raised a brow at the paper and looked worried at Sam who just shrugged and kept on reading the paper.</p>
<p>"In Vitro Fertilization is a technique involving the fertilization of eggs by sperm in a test tube outside the body. This is probably the only way to continue the reproduction of your race, Miss Julian." Nicole gave Ms Glass an icy look as her classmates burst in to a giggle in unison.</p>
<p>"It was developed as a treatment for women who have blocked or badly damaged Fallopian tubes which prevents the egg and sperm from meeting. However, it is more and more often used by gay rights activists to prove that same sex couples certainly can breed as well. Mr. John, can you turn out the lights please."</p>
<p>Ms Glass rolled the movie, grabbed a bag of popcorns and sat her self to read 'malicious today magazine' without paying any attention to either the movie or her students.</p>
<p>For every minute the movie continued, Brooke got a deeper frown between her eyes. Her mouth was half opened and her eyes got wider and wider until finally, she practically clanged on to Sam who wasn't even looking at the movie. She was too busy trying to figure out where her notebook could be.</p>
<p>"What's wrong Brooke?" She whispered.</p>
<p>"I-I don't.... So much ovary and sperm and... I don't know." Brooke answered without taking her eyes of the screen.</p>
<p>Sam smiled. She would expect Carmen to react like this about this kind of movies, but not Brooke. And speaking of Carmen, Sam turned her head to see how Carmen was doing and saw a similar frown on her face. "You're not the only one with the frown Honey."</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke looked at Sam for the first time during the movie.</p>
<p>"Look around."</p>
<p>Brooke looked around in the classroom. She saw Carmen's almost disgusted expression on her face and Josh sitting next to her looked more clueless than anything else. Sitting behind them, Lily looked almost too interested and Emory Dick looked as clueless as Josh. Brooke turned her head to look at the seat behind them and she saw Nicole polishing her nails and looking very unmoved. Next to her, Harrison had the same expression as most of the students of male gender in that classroom: confused.</p>
<p>"Harrison looks a bit worried, don't you think?" Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"I think it comes as a bit of a shock to him that two girls can have a baby without any of them having to sleep with a boy."</p>
<p>"Can the love birds please keep quiet?" Bobbi Glass shouted from behind her magazine.</p>
<p>Sam and Brooke had to hold a hand over their mouths to keep the laughter to burst out. Sam and Brooke's newfound love was still a very sensitive subject for Harrison and the two used to make fun of that all the time.</p>
<p>As the movie ended, Ms Glass put unwillingly away her magazine and turned on the lights. The students squinted at the sudden strong light.</p>
<p>"Bottom Line kids! With the fees of the many specialists involved in this process, it will cost many thousands of Dollars with no guarantee of success. I think adoption is a better option. And if you two Mc-Irritating lovebirds are denied adoption, you can always ask Esposito to fight for your right to do so. Any questions?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry flung her arm in the air immediately, nodding enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Bobbi Glass sighed. She was hoping to get rid of the kids as soon as possible to continue reading the article in malicious today magazine. "What is it Cherry?"</p>
<p>"Ah have a question, miss Glass, sir."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Ah was wonderin'; is it possible ta reproduct without havin' ta go through the customary constituents of repruduction, without in vitro fertilization bein' in the picture?"</p>
<p>"You mean virgin birth? No that is not possible as far as we know. Any other... Yes Cherry?" Ms Glass was getting impatient as Mary Cherry threw her arm in the air again.</p>
<p>"Mah cousin Mary-Lou ones had an experience with virgin birth. Only, the strangest thing happened after nine moths. Her stomach just sunk in and the baby had disappeared! We figured the devil took it!" Mary Cherry looked around the classroom with her eyes wide and her arms stretched out to her sides, while her classmates looked at her with their brows raised.</p>
<p>"I think what your cousin Mary-Lou experienced is a feign pregnancy, whitch means that one thinks she is pregnant as the body starts to show sign of pregnancy, though she is actually not. This is sometimes caused by mental illness or other psyshic stress. I do not think the devil took her child, Cherry. Or did you, miss Julian?"</p>
<p>Nicole offered her teacher a sarcastic smile and continued polishing her nails while Mary Cherry looked puzzled at Nicole, with her head crooked to the side.</p>
<p>"Did ya steal mah cousin Mary-Lou's baby, Nic?"</p>
<p>"I know using your brain is not one of your best abilities Mary Cherry, but you can't actually believe that I would steal your stupid cousin's stupid non-existing baby?"</p>
<p>Mary Cherry nod rapidly and Nicole sighed. "I did not steal a baby Mary Cherry. It was just a mocking remark claw made referring to me being evil."</p>
<p>"That is right Miss Julian. You are indeed the spawn of Satan, if not Satan her self."</p>
<p>The bell rang and everybody got up to leave. Miss Glass did not even bother to give them any assignments. She was comfortable with just letting them all flunk her class.</p>
<p>"Is it just me or has Bobbi Glass just got more bitter and mean over the years?" Carmen asked Mary Cherry as they walked out.</p>
