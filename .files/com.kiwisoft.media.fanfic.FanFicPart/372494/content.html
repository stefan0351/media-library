<p><b>Chapter 4</b><br>
Quinn woke the next morning, her brain a little fuzzy, to the sound of what sounded like power tools. Her first thought was to find out who was using a chainsaw in her bedroom. When she realized that she wasn't in her bedroom but the common room of the cabin it was even a little more confusing. The loud buzzing was coming from…the floor? Quinn looked down to see Rachel curled up on the rug between the couch and fireplace with a pillow and blanket, her mouth hanging open and the source of the chainsaw sound very apparent.</p>
<p>"Rachel?"</p>
<p>The response was a grunt and a few mumbles before Rachel rolled over and resumed snoring. It was slightly humorous; Rachel would probably die if she knew she snored like a bear. Quinn could picture it: Rachel would demand to see a sleep doctor immediately, even if it meant driving to Buffalo, and then insist on getting one of those machines for people with sleep apnea or whatever.</p>
<p>"Rachel, wake up."</p>
<p>Another grunt.</p>
<p>"Rachel, Barbra Streisand's on the phone. You were nominated for a Tony."</p>
<p>Quinn fully expected a comedic scene to take place with Rachel sitting bolt upright and being awake, just like what happened in the movies or books. Rachel's response wasn't nearly as dramatic but it was still a little comedic.</p>
<p>"Nominations were in May," Rachel mumbled. "Ceremony next week."</p>
<p>"There's a bear?"</p>
<p>"Mkay."</p>
<p>Quinn finally settled for throwing a pillow at the brunette. At that point, Rachel sat up and blinked a few times.</p>
<p>"Why am I in here?" Rachel asked, eyebrows furrowed.</p>
<p>"I don't know, I passed out."</p>
<p>"I went to bed. How did I get in here?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, Rachel!"</p>
<p>"Strange."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>It happened again the next night, too. Quinn woke up in the morning with Rachel curled up on the rug and the brunette woke up thoroughly confused looking as to why she was in the common room.</p>
<p>They planned the camping trip at every moment that Quinn was coherent and alert. There was a state park about an hour away with camping facilities and it was decided that was where they would go after Quinn's knee healed. For the remainder of the week, Quinn woke up to the sound of Rachel The Chainsaw. Rachel's dads just chuckled when it was brought up and said over dinner on the fourth morning that Rachel had a tendency to sleepwalk when she was younger. They weren't worried about it as long as the doors were locked.</p>
<p>Quinn thought it was a little…well, it was a little sweet. Rachel could've sleepwalked anywhere in the house but something brought her back to the rug in the common room each night. She stayed up one night and right around one in the morning was when Rachel walked in with her blanket and pillow. The brunette patted Quinn on the head before she curled up on the rug and started snoring.</p>
<p>It took a week after the accident before Quinn had a chance to sit with her mother and talk. And they did. It may have been a little bit drug induced but Quinn started spilling out about wanting a relationship and wishing she could talk to her mother and just <i>needing</i> her. She didn't remember most of it, her brain was a little hazy, but she did remember bits and pieces.</p>
<p>"I just want us to be happy."</p>
<p>"I'm right here, sweetie," Judy said with a smile, her eyes filled with tears. "We'll be okay."</p>
<p>It hurt, but ten days after she busted her knee she was determined to go an entire day without crutches and minimal pain killers. Rachel was right there next to her when she walked anywhere. It was sweet and helpful until she attempted to accompany Quinn to the bathroom. The blonde drew the line there.</p>
<p>A slew of insults ran through her brain, all of them quite brilliant, but she didn't let a single one out of her mouth. She smiled and thanked Rachel for being so attentive but assured her that this was one task she could handle on her own.</p>
<p>Quinn assured the Berrys and her mother that the camping trip was definitely on after the day without crutches. It gave the go-ahead for Bruce and Michael to rent the equipment and start packing the SUV on a Thursday, ready to leave on Friday morning. Rachel was running around making lists and triple checking absolutely everything. Quinn honestly thought about drugging the short brunette but ultimately decided against it when Rachel found they hadn't packed matches or a lighter.</p>
<p>The night before they left, Quinn did something she never dared do before. When Rachel excused herself to her room after dinner, Quinn followed. She'd wanted to before then, sure, but she was a little immobile for a while. Besides, Rachel seemed content with being alone.</p>
<p>"Is there something you needed?" Rachel asked when Quinn knocked on the door frame.</p>
<p>Quinn shrugged. She honestly didn't know what she wanted other than to just…well…she wanted to be around Rachel. To hang out…to be friends.</p>
<p>"Quinn? Hello?"</p>
<p>"Sorry. If you're busy I'll leave you alone."</p>
<p>"I was just planning on reading a little. Is everything alright?"</p>
<p>It was now or never. "I was wondering if you wanted to hang out."</p>
<p>Quinn couldn't help but smile when Rachel's face lit up and she set her book down. Taking Rachel moving over on her bed and patting the space next to her as a sign to come in, Quinn took the space on the bed next to Rachel. She picked up Rachel's book to move it but when Rachel lunged out to grab it, Quinn reached further away.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Uh…" Rachel blushed, "I just…it's not my book. I found it on one of the sh-shelves out there."</p>
<p>Quinn looked at the cover, <u>Lady Chatterly's Lover</u>, and flipped open to one of the pages. As she skimmed over the page she felt a blush rise to her cheeks and a grin spread across her lips. She had to try and scramble away as Rachel practically climbed on top of her to pry the book from her hands. Deciding to have a little fun, Quinn started reading aloud.</p>
<p>"'For a moment he was still inside her, turgid there and quivering. Then as he began to move, in the sudden helpless orgasm, there awoke in her new strange thrills rippling inside her. Rippling, rippling, rippling, like a flapping overlapping of soft flames, soft as feathers, running to points of brilliance, exquisite and melting her all molten inside.' Oh my God, Berry, what the hell are you reading?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know! I just…I started reading and it…" Rachel whined and finally pulled back. She crossed her arms over her chest and pouted. It was difficult for Quinn to stifle her laughter at the brunette's pout because, well, Rachel looked a little <i>cute</i>. Except…no. That wasn't right. Quinn wasn't supposed to find Rachel's flushed cheeks and pouty lips desirable in the least. She shook her head and shut the book. That had to have been it, the book.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you liked to read smut."</p>
<p>"I don-Well, I mean…it's very well-written and not really trashy or vulgar as some."</p>
<p>"So you read a lot of porn?"</p>
<p>Rachel's blush deepened. "Is this some cruel joke?" she mumbled. "Get Rachel to admit something embarrassing and then spread it around?"</p>
<p>Quinn had no response to that. It wasn't her motivation, of course, she was genuinely going to try and be friendlier with Rachel. After all, the girl had taken care of her over the last week and a half. Quinn considered Rachel not just an acquaintance anymore but a friend. However, understandably, Rachel appeared hesitant.</p>
<p>"Maybe a couple weeks ago," Quinn finally said. Rachel's eyes flickered up to meet her own. "Look, Rachel, I just…I want to be friends, alright? We're going to be here for a while and we might as well."</p>
<p>"If you weren't stuck here you'd still hate me, wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Rachel nodded a little. "And once you resume your position on the Cheerios, things will go back to the way they were."</p>
<p>Quinn shrugged. She really didn't know. Yeah, she'd have to go back to being a bitch but there was a chance that if things worked out with Rachel that she might show the girl a little friendliness even in the halls of McKinley.</p>
<p>"It'd be nice to have a friend," Rachel said softly.</p>
<p>Quinn waited for the follow up of, "here for the summer" but it never came. She tossed Rachel's book onto the bed and smirked. "Well, don't worry," she said, "your secret love of porn is safe with me."</p>
<p>Rachel rolled her eyes and giggled. A silence fell over the pair and Quinn tried to think of something, anything, to say but Rachel's phone saved her from it.</p>
<p>"It's Finn," Rachel sighed. "He's attempting to…well…you don't want to know."</p>
<p>"Let me guess," Quinn chuckled, "'baby, you make me so horny'?"</p>
<p>Rachel nodded. Quinn shuddered a little. Finn had tried the same things with her and it just didn't work. She wasn't turned on by him in the slightest. Of course, if she was honest with herself, she wasn't turned on by any guy in the slightest. (Yes, she was fully aware she'd had a baby but there was alcohol involved in that and she was a lightweight.) The Cheerios, on the other hand…But that thought was always shoved out of her mind and replaced with more pleasant thoughts. Like…running laps around the track or getting a paper cut. Because Quinn Fabray could have any guy she wanted and that's what was expected.</p>
<p>"How do I get him to stop?"</p>
<p>"You break up with him," Quinn blurted out. There wasn't any viciousness in her voice but she really didn't mean to say it that quickly. It was, however, the truth.</p>
<p>Rachel sighed. "For now, I simply ignore it." She tossed her phone in her nightstand drawer and smiled her famous Rachel Berry smile and Quinn most definitely couldn't shove the realization that her heart sped up a bit out of her head.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">XXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>It was quite possibly the most unexpected thing Rachel had ever experienced when Quinn knocked on her bedroom door. It was awkward at first, especially when Quinn got a hold of her book. Actually that part was incredibly humiliating. She swore her secrecy, though, and Rachel felt a little better. Quinn hadn't ever actually broken a promise to her. She was always brutally honest, even if it was negative but she was honest nonetheless. Could Rachel trust her? Only time would tell.</p>
<p>After the awkwardness and the just plain unintelligent sounding text from Finn (<i>babe, wish u were here. so horny rn.</i>) things seemed to flow a little more smoothly. They talked for a little bit about school and glee club and the weather. Quinn had noticed Rachel's DVDs she'd bought and suggested they watch something. They settled close together on Rachel's twin bed to watch <i>The Mask of Zorro</i>.</p>
<p>The next morning, the morning they were to leave to drive to the camp ground, Rachel woke up unable to move one side of her body. Her brain's first thought was that she was paralyzed and her chances at stardom were ruined but then she found that the reason she was unable to move was because Quinn was practically lying on top of her. Rachel smiled a little. It wasn't the most comfortable position in the world, she couldn't feel her left arm and her left leg was tangled at an awkward angle with the blonde's, but it wasn't exactly uncomfortable either.</p>
<p>Rachel jumped a little when her bedroom door opened quietly; Michael stepped inside and quirked an eyebrow at the position in which he'd found his daughter and his daughter's new friend.</p>
<p>"Time to get up," he said a little loudly.</p>
<p>Quinn stirred and Rachel immediately shushed her father.</p>
<p>"I'll wake her up, Dad."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you will," he said with a grin.</p>
<p>Rachel rolled her eyes. "She's my <i>friend</i> and I don't want her startled and falling off the bed. She could potentially re-injure her knee."</p>
<p>"Of course, sweetie. Breakfast in fifteen minutes then we're loading up."</p>
<p>Rachel nodded and waited until her door was shut again before gently rubbing Quinn's shoulder. The blonde stirred and groaned before gripping a little tighter to Rachel's waist.</p>
<p>"Quinn, you have to get up. Breakfast in fifteen minutes."</p>
<p>"Five more minutes," the blonde mumbled.</p>
<p>"I can't feel my arm."</p>
<p>Quinn's eyes fluttered open and Rachel smiled a little as sleepy hazel eyes connected with her own. This moment, whatever it was, had a hint of something. Rachel could feel her sixth sense screaming at her but it was drowned out by the sound of Quinn's sleepy voice and her (very, very captivating) eyes.</p>
<p>"When did I fall asleep?"</p>
<p>"In the middle of <i>A Walk to Remember</i>."</p>
<p>"Oh. Why didn't you wake me up?"</p>
<p>"I was rather tired, myself. I…I couldn't."</p>
<p>Quinn nodded. It wasn't until the blonde moved to sit up that Rachel realized she'd been holding onto her shoulder the entire time, tracing patterns on the pale skin. She grimaced at the tingling sensation in her other arm when Quinn sat up and the blood rushed backed to her extremity.</p>
<p>After a quick breakfast of whatever they could find, the Fabrays and the Berrys loaded up the Berry SUV with the remainder of their things, and headed to the campground. Rachel felt awkward sitting between the two blondes but she was the smallest and therefore the only one that could sit comfortably in the middle seat. The drive to the camp ground that the man at the supply store had suggested was an hour and Quinn managed to fall asleep, her head landed on Rachel's shoulder. Rachel, slightly drowsy herself, leaned her head on top of Quinn's and relaxed a little. The scent of mixed berry from Quinn's body spray made her smile a little.</p>
<p>Once at the campsite, Rachel was in awe at Quinn's direction. The blonde started setting up tents like a pro and tying bags for trash to tree branches; she glanced around the space a few times before strategically placing lanterns to give them plenty of light when nightfall came.</p>
<p>"Quinn…you're a very…well, I never took you for an outdoor girl of this caliber," Rachel said as Quinn meticulously placed wood (Rachel's dads had started piling it up while Quinn was setting up tents) in the fire pit, followed by the straw and shredded newspaper that came with the starter kit that Bruce had picked up.</p>
<p>"Cheerios training," Quinn said as she struck a match. "Freshman year Sylvester dropped all of us off just outside of Columbus with three tents, a newspaper, a box of matches, a Swiss army knife, what we packed for what was supposed to be a spa weekend, a ten pound sack of rice, and then wished us luck."</p>
<p>Rachel blinked. "That's insane. You had money, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"She went through our stuff and took our wallets." Quinn smiled when the larger pieces of wood started catching fire. "It took a week get back to Lima; we had to learn quickly."</p>
<p>"A week?"</p>
<p>"Brittany was the navigator."</p>
<p>Rachel nodded. "Right. So you survived a week walking from Columbus to Lima but you were unable to run through the woods without falling?"</p>
<p>"Shut up, Berry," Quinn chuckled. "One of the seniors was a CNA; she handled the first-aid."</p>
<p>Lunch was simple: pre-packed sandwiches and chips. The Berry men took the water jugs to a spigot to fill while Rachel, Quinn, and Judy finished setting up camp. Rachel furrowed her eyebrows when they took out the air mattresses and counted only three - two doubles and a single.</p>
<p>"They gave us the wrong ones," Michael groaned when they got back. "I told them three singles and a double."</p>
<p>Rachel thought briefly about offering to share with Quinn, the memory of waking up that morning still lingering in her brain. It was…comfortable. It was nice. It was something she could totally see happening repeatedly…Except <i>not</i>. Rachel shook her head. This was Quinn Fabray she was thinking about. The Cheerio that would go right back to torturing her the second they got back to Lima. Quinn Fabray, the girl who had tortured her since the sixth grade. Quinn Fabray, the girl with an insanely hot body, captivating eyes, and really nice legs in the shorts she was currently wearing…Rachel shook her head again. This wasn't happening. Clearly, she'd spent too much time away from Finn. That was it. Finn Hudson the quarterback, the handsome male lead, not the brightest crayon in the box…and a typical sex-crazed teenage boy.</p>
<p>The five of them stared at the mattresses until Quinn spoke up.<br>
"I'll sleep on the ground, no big deal."</p>
<p>"No!" Rachel turned bright red as all eyes turned to her after she shrieked. "Y-your knee," she stuttered. "I don't think it would be conducive to the continued healing of your knee if you were to sleep on the ground, Quinn."</p>
<p>"My knee is fine, Rachel. Trust me, I've slept on the bleachers at school, this won't be half as bad."</p>
<p>"The blea-"</p>
<p>"Cheerios."</p>
<p>Rachel shook her head. "That woman is insane."</p>
<p>"Quinn and I could share the other double," Judy said. "It's only for two nights."</p>
<p>"Mom that's…I don't know."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't mind sharing if Quinn's alright with it." Rachel smiled innocently. Quinn shrugged.</p>
<p>"If you won't let me sleep on the ground then there's nothing else I can do."</p>
<p>Rachel nodded and grabbed onto the double mattress, moving it into the larger tent with the single. The smile never let her face.</p>
