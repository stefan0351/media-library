<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 11 -->

<p>"I didn't think that it would be so cold out," Josh commented as he spotted
Brooke rubbing her hands together.  Once Brooke had arrived he had suggested
they take a walk around the golf course adjacent to his house since he
really didn't want to have a run in with his parents.  "Here," he continued
stopping and reaching over for her hands pulling them into his and rubbing
them briskly.  "We could go back if you want."</p>

<p>"It's okay," Brooke responded lightly.  "I like it out here."</p>

<p>"Yeah me too," he said letting go of her hands and turning back around.</p>

<p>"I remember," Brooke responded dropping her head slightly as they began to
walk again.  "How are things with your mother?" she questioned finally,
assuming that his family problems were the reason he had asked her to meet
him.</p>

<p>Josh rubbed his neck uncomfortably and scrunched his face up at the
question.  "It's…not good," he said slowly.  "He just doesn't get her…or
me…it's like he's still in the days of black and white TV."  He paused there
working up the courage to continue.  "I think…maybe that's why it was so
hard for me when we broke up…because I thought we had what they didn't, I
thought we got each other," he went on slyly checking on Brooke's reaction.</p>

<p>"I think that we did…that we do," Brooke responded slowly, carefully.  "But
relationships aren't that simple," she continued.</p>

<p>"I know," Josh replied just as carefully.  "That's why people have to work
at them, which is why a lot of them don't work out," he continued keeping
his gaze on the grass beneath his feet.  "I've just been thinking about this
a lot, and I was thinking that we could work on ours, we both have strong
work ethics in regards to everything else so why not this," he continued
finally looking up at her.</p>

<p>"Josh…" Brooke started, he knew what she was going to say and interrupted
her.</p>

<p>"Just hear me out," he stated though there was a somewhat pleading tone to
his voice.  "We're both still not seeing anyone," he continued even though
they both knew it was a lie, "and I'm not saying that we have to jump back
in right away, just that we were good together, and think that we could be
again.  I miss you, and I think that we could be like romantic friends or
something like that anyway until it was just romantic again, you know?"</p>

<p>"You know I care about you so much," Brooke said ceasing to walk.  "But…"
Once again Josh knew where this going, at least in regards to him.  She was
going to tell him that they should stay friends, he needed to pre-empt that,
so he did the thing that he thought would make the most sense, he closed the
distance between them and kissed her.</p>

<p>Brooke was stunned at the first touch of Josh's lips to hers, she truly
hadn't seen that one coming.  After a moment however, she realized what was
going on, and that when she hadn't pulled away Josh had started to deepen
the kiss.  And as they stood there together, Josh's lips pressed against
hers all she could think about was how she felt absolutely nothing, how
although Josh was many things and a great guy he wasn't Sam, and he would
never be able to make her feel how Sam made her feel, and she wrenched her
lips away from his.</p>

<p>"Don't do that again," Brooke said in a low, warning tone once they had
separated.</p>

<p>Josh was quiet for a moment, looking down at his shoes once more.  Despite
Brooke's words he was comforted by what he assumed to be her positive
response to the kiss.  For the first time since talking to Nicole he began
to believe fully that Brooke was just with Sam because he wasn't around.
Why else would she have let him kiss her for as long as she did?  He decided
to play the cards that he held in his hand, to let Brooke know that it was
okay, and that he'd take her back despite what she'd done with Sam.</p>

<p>"We should be with people that we love, not just with anyone who's around or
who'll give us what we temporarily need," Josh said quietly a moment later.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked beyond confused by his response.</p>

<p>"I know that you're seeing someone," he continued ignoring her question,
"that you were lonely after we broke up, but you shouldn't let pride ruin
you or blind you to what's happening around you."</p>

<p>"If I'm seeing someone," Brooke started carefully still not sure what to
make of Josh's cryptic speak, "it's a decision I made.  Not out of
loneliness, not out of pride, and not out of fear, but because I wanted to,"
she continued firmly, confident at least in the statement of her own
feelings.</p>

<p>"Because you wanted to," Josh repeated, mostly for his own benefit, but
Brooke picked up on it.</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to," Brooke repeated confidently.  She didn't want to hurt
Josh, but she didn't want to give him false hope either.  She couldn't have
him walking around thinking that there was a chance for them.</p>

<p>"But Nicole…" Josh started to say looking up at Brooke with shinning eyes,
he trailed off however, not sure if wanted to continue.</p>

<p>"But Nicole what?" Brooke asked with a strong sense of foreboding.  "Please
Josh," she asked when she saw him hesitate.</p>

<p>"Nicole said that reason you were with her was because you missed me," Josh
responded not able to keep all of the hurt and accusation hidden.  "She said
that you were upset…and Sam comforted you 'too well'," he went on.</p>

<p>"She told you?  About Sam?" Brooke asked slightly stunned.</p>

<p>"She said I needed to straighten you back out or there would be
unpleasantness, she said it was for your own good, that Sam was taking
advantage of you.  She never said that…it was your decision.  I didn't know
that you wanted…" he trailed off and turned his head away from her the pain
that he was in so clearly written over his face and in his voice.</p>

<p>Brooke stood by watching him helplessly, she was torn up inside seeing him
like that.  Finally, she crossed the few steps separating them and reached
out to him, drawing him into a hug.  She had never wanted to hurt him, and
she had loved him, did love him in a way.  She just wasn't in love with him,
and not for the first time she was overcome with guilt for it.  She should
have loved him, they were perfect for each other, everyone had said so.  But
it didn't work out that way, and not for the first time she wondered why.</p>

<p>Finally, Josh pulled himself together and moved away from Brooke.  "You're
not going to take me back are you?" he asked even though it was clear from
his tone that he already knew the answer.</p>

<p>"No," she replied as gently as she could while rejecting him once more.  "I
can't," she said deciding to leave it at that feeling that to tell him she
loved Sam would be rubbing salt into an open wound.</p>

<p>"Nicole," Josh said straightening his shoulders.  "She'll take you down if
you stay with Sam," he continued.  "She says it'll ruin all of us, not just
you.  I got the distinct impression that after me the only game plan was
seek and destroy."</p>

<p>Brooke listened to his words and knew with certainty that he was telling the
truth.  It only confirmed what she secretly feared and the feeling that had
been rattling her ever since her encounter with Nicole in the Novak.  Still,
even though she shouldn't have been surprised as this was classic Nicole
Julian, she couldn't help feeling extremely hurt and betrayed.  She felt
tears come to her eyes and turned her head away from Josh trying to blink
them out as she wrestled with her emotions.</p>

<p>"Et tu, Josh?" she asked finally, a tear running down her cheek even as she
turned to face him.  "What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say," Josh started softly.  "That I wish you could have loved me half as
much as I love you.  I say, I wish that Nicole had never come to me and told
me what she knew. I say that even though it's tearing me up inside, if
you're happy, then I'll do what I can though I have no idea what that could
be.  And finally, I say that the past ten hours have really, really blown,"
he concluded.</p>

<p>Brooke reached out a hand and placed her on his face when he had finished.
"Thank you," she said softly, her voice cracking with emotion.  He shrugged
stoically simply observing her for a moment.</p>

<p>"She'll do it you know," he said finally.  "She'll do it in front of the
whole school gleefully."</p>

<p>"I know," Brooke said dropping her gaze and her hand.  "She's been waiting
for this, to usurp the crown.  She wants to be Sandra Dee and I've given her
just what she needs," Brooke responded finally seeing the reason behind the
hostility in Nicole's voice when she had referred to herself as Brooke's
Rizzo.  Nicole had risen through the ranks like a superstar, but once she
got to a certain point there was nowhere for her to go because Brooke was
standing in front of her, and as long as Brooke was there, Nicole would
always be number two, and second place was never good enough for Nicole
Julian, she was a gold medallist-even if she had to lie, cheat and steal to
get to the podium.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"  Josh asked curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," Brooke replied honestly.  "How does one go about
thwarting an evil genius?" she asked before chuckling darkly.  "It's funny,
I don't know how to defend my position because I've never had to.  Nicole's
always been there in the trenches flinging mud at anyone who came near,
snapping at their heels for me.  Only now she's flinging it at me, and I
think that she's out of my league," Brooke finished wearily, dejectedly.</p>

<p>They stood in silence for a moment after that, each of them considering what
a victory for Nicole would entail and shuddering at the thought of such a
bleak future.  "I've gotta try though," Brooke said finally.  "But I'll need
your help."  Josh simply nodded his agreement.  "I need to buy some time,"
she said in response to his nod.  "Just tell her that you think that her
plan's working and I'll take care of the rest," she continued although she
really had no idea what on earth she was going to or could do.</p>
