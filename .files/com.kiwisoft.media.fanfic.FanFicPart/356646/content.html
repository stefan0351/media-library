<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 15 -->

<p>The Countess Hela sat on her makeshift throne, idly tormenting the
nearly dead young woman suspended from the ceiling in front of her. She
hated waiting. </p>

<p>Ten large vampires lounged around the room, awaiting her orders to
proceed with the mission the Countess had assigned them earlier in the
evening. </p>

<p>The large Latino servant Max entered the room and hurried to his beloved
mistress' side. </p>

<p>"Your grace." Max said as he bowed reverently and kissed the exotically
beautiful demoness' offered hand. "There is news of your Slayer and her
witch." </p>

<p>She smiled at her pet psychotic and signalled her pleasure at his
worship. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;Soon they will all bow to me as my Max does.&lt;&gt; Hela told herself.
"Tell me my dearest Max." she purred. "What are my little future pets up
to?" </p>

<p>"Your scouts have reported that they are out and alone." her favorite
and only willing human servant reported. "According to reports the two
are heading toward the old cemetery just as you predicted, your grace.
The scout stayed with them long enough to be sure of their destination
then it came straight here." </p>

<p>"Very good, my precious Max." she cooed as she lightly ran her talons
across his massive muscular chest rewarding him with her touch. "It will
soon be time to leave. Once we have them we will be going home to the
jungle house. I grow tired of this place." </p>

<p>"Anything for you, your grace." Max moaned trembling in the ecstasy of
her attentions. "I await your commands." </p>

<p>"Of course." the Countess sighed, smiling benevolently at the enraptured
man. Then she rose from her throne. She reached up and released the
girl's body letting it fall to the cold stone floor. </p>

<p>Max looked down on the broken yet still living anonymous female on the
floor. He smirked as he remembered how arrogant and aloof she was when
she'd first arrived. </p>

<p>She had looked down her nose at him like he was a lowly peasant. He
smiled coldly as he thought about how she'd bragged about being chosen
by the Countess. </p>

<p>&lt;&gt;My how the mighty have fallen.&lt;&gt; Max thought with a smirk. &lt;&gt;From top
of
the world to pet food in 24 hours.&lt;&gt; </p>

<p>As the psychotic butler followed his beloved mistress toward the
awaiting vampires, the first of the small demon-spawn creatures came out
of the shadows and began sniffing the immobile object. It was soon
joined by it's siblings. </p>

<p>Sensing no threat they began feasting on the helpless quivering,
screaming girl. </p>

<p>Max walked away laughing as the girl's screams soon died down to a
gurgle. His mistress came to her cadre of vampires that was awaiting her
orders. They snapped to attention at her approach. </p>

<p>Their fear of both her, and her human assistant, was almost palpable in
the air as they watched her glowing red eyes inspecting them. </p>

<p>"Alright my children." the Countess Hela purred in her deep rasping
voice. "It is time for you to prove your worthiness to serve me.
Remember, the Slayer and her witch-kit are to be taken with a minimum of
damage.
Also my dear Kresis is fair game. In fact I do not want him to live
through the night. Follow my orders and your rewards will be great, fail
me and your short lives will be exquisitely painful. Now go, I will join
you shortly." </p>

<p>The vampires rushed out determined to follow the Countess' orders to the
letter, even those that hadn't been in her service long had seen enough
to have no doubt that she was quite capable of carrying out her every
threat. </p>

<p>"Stay with me Max. I want you safe and unharmed my pet." Hela purred
while she absent-mindedly stroked the madman's shiny black hair. "We
will pick up the personal guards and go, so we can be there in case
those fools ruin my plans." </p>

<p>"As you wish, your grace." the psychotic Latino answered breathlessly at
his beloved mistress concern. "I am your to command always." </p>

<p>"Of course you are, precious." Hela laughed and signalled two huge
hulking, red skinned demons to follow as she left the room. </p>

<p>The Countess and her entourage left the house and headed to the ambush
point in the old cemetery. As the group walked through the streets Hela
confided her plans to Max. </p>

<p>"On the way back to the jungle house I think I will contact that nice
chaos demon in L.A." she said speculativly. "I will have him gather up a
few playmates for us to take with us. What do you think Max?" </p>

<p>"As you wish your grace." he answered then added enthusiastically. "May
I request one or two red heads this time? They are ever so much fun and
they scream so prettily." </p>

<p>She looked at her favorite pet and was amused by his child like manner
when he made his request. </p>

<p>"Oh alright." Hela said as if indulging a favorite child. "Just
remember, you are not allowed to break them without permission and only
after you have finished your duties. Is that understood?" </p>

<p>"Of course your grace." he answered overwhelmed by her generosity. </p>

<p>Hela chuckled at her pet's excitement as they stepped into the shadows
of the night.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>Time moved like a snail on the edge of a razor blade for the impatient
Count Kresis. He knew he'd been played for a fool by his ex-mate Hela.
That she'd almost caused him to violate an edict from the master of
Tarsus, his home world. </p>

<p>No one, demon or not, aristocrat or commoner, would dare violate one of
his edicts. </p>

<p>Fortunately for Kresis he was able to discover the plot his ex had
hatched and now he had compiled evidence that she was completely insane. </p>

<p>It had taken him a while to figure out her entire plan. At first he
thought she was just trying to destroy him. </p>

<p>It was perfect, either the Slayer and her witch would do the job or he
would do away with one or both of them, then he would be hunted down and
destroyed by his own kind for violating one of the dark master's orders. </p>

<p>That plan in and of itself was devious, vicious, and very nearly
perfect. But now after studying the reports of his scouts and
infiltrators along with Hela's recent acts he had finally understood the
real depths and pure audacity of her plans, and the completeness of her
insanity. </p>

<p>Kresis head spun at the unbelievability of what his ancient nemesis was
trying. Not only did Hela mean to destroy him, but she apparently
intended to use him to wear down the Slayer and her witch-kit until she
was able to take them, and after breaking them to her will that bitch
was going to use them as a weapon against the council and quite possibly
the Dark master himself. </p>

<p>Kresis had to laugh at the irony of it all. Hela was always talking
about how he was so stupidly chauvinistic that he inevitably
underestimated his female adversaries. </p>

<p>Well he'd learned his lessons many earth centuries ago when the Countess
had betrayed him into exile. </p>

<p>Now here she was thinking that she alone could defeat the latest
incarnation of the great Sorceress or, even more ridiculous, that she
could separate the Sorceress from her Slayer now that they'd
acknowledged each other. </p>

<p>He couldn't believe that after all this time Hela was falling for her
own reputation and thought that she, or any other of their race had the
strength to do that. </p>

<p>It was obvious to him that she hadn't felt the steadily increasing power
of the young witch-kit, but he had. </p>

<p>The first time they had clashed she had barely fought off his assault.
However this last time he had attacked her on several different planes
at once and although she had collapsed with exhaustion, Kresis had
barely survived the backlash caused by her power. </p>

<p>It struck him that Hela had no idea that every time the Sorceress was
pushed to her limits by a metaphysical attack, her powers increased
three-fold. He hadn't known himself until he'd done some in depth
research , and the math. </p>

<p>This meant that Kresis had more working knowledge on the situation than
Hela. </p>

<p>"For the first time I've gotten a step ahead of my precious ex." Kresis
told himself out loud, attracting the attention of his three remaining
retainers. Noticing this he turned to them. "Well I hope you are better
at fighting your own kind than you have been against the Slayer and her
friends, because if we fail tonight none of us will see tomorrow's
sunset." </p>

<p>The Count spun with a flourish and left the room followed by his
retainers, all realizing they were headed for the battle of their
unlives. </p>

<p>This time they faced a far worse enemy then ever, not the Slayer and the
Sorceress, but a Countess of the first circle and her small army of
their own kind. It was a toss as to which would kill them first. </p>
