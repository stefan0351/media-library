<p>Personal log, Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres Star date, ..... you know the drill</p>

		<p>I often wonder why I do this. Keeping a personal log, I mean. This is certainly not intended to be viewed by others, so why keep it in the first place? At least it gives me someone to talk to about everything. I suppose now I should tell you about the fact that I had "the dream" again. We didn't kiss, no. From what I can recall we seemed to have cuddled. But the situation is escalating. I am starting to hallucinate I believe.</p>

		<p>Around lunchtime today, I was in Engineering doing some reports in my office and then ..... I suddenly felt the embrace of her. She put her arms around me from behind and I felt her breathing on my neck and the warmth of her body pressing into mine. And then ..... reality caught up on me, in the form of Vorik who broke this vision ..... hallucination. What ever. I don't know what to call it. Why is it always her? Normally the only dreams that repeat themselves are my nightmares. Thankfully they are now only a seldom occurrence, they used to be many many more. Nightmares about father leaving, about the kids who thought it fun to tease the half-breed, about the Maquis dying. The list goes on. But I never had a pleasant dream repeating itself. Although thinking about it, this dreaming seems to be more like different experiences the only repetition is the person. She always stays the same.</p>

		<p>She called me be'nal. Wife. Being awake now I have sufficient time to panic. Me married to a woman? Mother would disown me all over again. I am starting to get comfortable with the thought though. She makes me feel more than any man ever has. I love her more than I did ever love a man.</p>

		<p>Oh Torres, 'she' is just a dream. Go to the doctor let him play shrink, but just stop talking like 'she' is real.</p>

		<p>I am getting more comfortable around Seven, we're still not talking much, but the silence is much more comfortable than before. Perhaps it isn't so bad after all to have to live with her.</p>

		<p>Naomi was here again, when I came back from my shift, she barely looked up, greeted me and asked me to join them. I was a little baffled, no one has ever asked me to play with them, not even as a child. Seven asked me to join them too. So I sat down on the floor and we played. I actually had a great time. I wonder why she is always already here when I get home? Perhaps her shifts are shorter. Sharing quarters really isn't so bad after all, I am not so alone. But we're forced to be here. I hope Janeway will decide quickly that her punishment is over.</p>

		<p>Apropos Janeway she is acting strange, not that one would notice it only looking on the surface, but I have known her for 5 years now. Everyone on the ship has known her that long, at least, yeah they know the captain, but not Kathryn ..... and though my observation skills are not as good as Seven's - nobody is as good as her when it comes to that - I can still tell something is bothering her. She even smells different. Sometimes I wonder why Klingons need that good a sense of smell.</p>

		<p>Well, I had a good day, although I wish I could spend off duty time outside of my ..... our quarters. It's kind of getting boring to read or do reports and Harry and Tom are both on duty, when I am off duty. On the other hand, spending time playing on the floor isn't so bad and listening to Seven's music is certainly not boring. I will end here, wish me nice dreams, Computer!</p>
