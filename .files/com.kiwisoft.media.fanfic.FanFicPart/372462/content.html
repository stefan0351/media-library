The Wizardess and the Vampire, Chapter 10 by patricia51<p>"Oh my GOSH!"<p>All four Russos sitting in the kitchen rushed pell-mell up the stairs at the sound of Theresa's loud exclamation. Alex was in the lead, afraid of she knew not what. The foursome pounded down the hall to the room Juliet and Alex shared. They tumbled in the door, coming to a sudden stop and a near catastrophic pile-up as they slammed on brakes. Eight eyes widened.<p>Juliet, still sleepy and now very confused, sat on the bed. Theresa sat beside her, an arm wrapped around her shoulder. But what held everyone breathless and speechless was the ball of light resting in the teenager's palm-up hand.<p>"Oh my gosh," Alex echoed her mother's words before she sat down on Juliet's unoccupied side. "Juliet?" There was no answer. "Sweetheart?"<p>"Hmmm?"<p>"How did you do that?"<p>"Oh, I just copied what you did the night the light bulb in your lamp blew out and you needed to find a replacement." Then Juliet seemed to come fully awake and aware. She stared at the light cupped in her hand. "Holy Cow!"<p>"That's what I meant when I said more than just becoming human might have happened to Juliet," Jerry Russo nodded in satisfaction. "And I was right."<p>"What has happened to her?" Alex demanded as she seized her girlfriend's free hand. "You can put the light out now Juliet. Just look at it and imagine it disappearing."<p>The other girl looked steadily at the light in her hand and it went out. "Wow," she laughed, a bit unsteadily and looked at Jerry. "Mr. Russo, what did you mean just then?"<p>"Juliet, I meant that when you wished not to be a vampire the power you were connected to, Alex and her brothers, was strong enough to grant that wish. But you couldn't just be 'not a vampire'. You had to become something. With the emotional connection between you and Alex it's hardly surprising what happened. You became a wizard."<p>"So what happens now?" the newly minted wizardess asked.<p>"You have two choices." Jerry met Theresa's eyes and the mother nodded. "You can go back to your parents."<p>"NO!" Juliet recovered herself after the one word outburst. "I know they're my parents and I think that they mean well, as poorly as they show it sometimes. But I would rather not, if I have a choice."<p>"Well then," Theresa said briskly. "Welcome to the family."<p>Alex and Juliet sat bolt upright. "Really?" they said together.<p>"Really," confirmed Jerry. "Now, we're going to have to get some things settled. We'll need to come up with school records for the 'cousin' who recently moved in with us. We'll need a birth certificate, other papers. Nothing a little magic can't handle. Speaking of magic, lessons are every Tuesday and Thursday. Alex will fill you in on that."<p>"And we'll need more clothes, shoes, all kinds of things," Theresa spoke, excited at the idea of another girl to take shopping. "There's a lot to do."<p>Still chatting the two adult Russos left the room, along with Max, who was blurting out questions ninety miles an hour, most of which demonstrated that Jerry had still not had the promised talk with his youngest.<p>Justin looked back and forth from one girl to the other and smiled. He tipped his sister's head up and gently kissed her on the forehead. He then repeated the action with Juliet before heading for the door. He had just grasped the doorknob when Alex spoke.<p>"Justin?" Her brother turned and looked back. "I love you too."<p>Justin smiled again and carefully closed the door behind him as he left.<p>Alone together at last Juliet nearly collapsed against Alex, who wrapped the other girl up in her arms. The cuddle turned to a seriously comforting squeeze when Alex realized her girlfriend was crying.<p>"What's wrong?"<p>"Nothing really," Juliet leaned into her girlfriend's circle of comfort. "I think I'm just overwhelmed with all that has happened. There's the confrontation with my parents and the revelation of what my mother has been doing. There's the transformation; this morning I was a vampire and now this evening I'm alive and a wizard. Then there's your family. They're so wonderful. Your Mom, your Dad, your brothers. Taking me in like this. And if I wasn't already in love with you I swear I'd fall in love with Justin."<p>"Yes," Alex sighed. "I may never forgive you for that."<p>"What?" Juliet sat up in a panic only to see the twinkle in Alex's eyes.<p>"I love Justin. He's smart and kind and generous and whenever I get myself into trouble he's always there to bail me out. But now he knows how much I appreciate it and care for him! It won't be near as much fun teasing him from now on."<p>"Well, we'll just have to do it together."<p>"Deal."<p>"And one more thing about today Alex."<p>"What's that?"<p>Juliet blushed. "When you called me 'sweetheart' just a few minutes ago. It gave me a thrill like I've never experienced before. And now that my heart actually beats I'm surprised you didn't hear it over all the commotion when you said that to me."<p>"I didn't even think about it," admitted Alex. "It just seemed like the right thing to say. I didn't even know you had heard it."<p>"Well I did," the former vampire smiled. "And I loved it. And I love you."<p>"I love you too," Alex smiled. "Sweetheart." The two girls kissed. Alex stroked her girlfriend's hair. Now that things were calm again she noticed how genuinely bedraggled and tired Juliet was. She considered a nice hot bath but decided that the other girl would fall asleep there in short order. Alex would either have to get help or use magic to get Juliet to bed. The idea of getting help didn't appeal to her and for once in her life Alex felt like she had used all the magic for one day that she wanted.<p>"Come on," said Alex as she help Juliet up. "To the shower my dear," she commanded and marched her girlfriend into the bathroom. She turned on the water, letting it run until it was nice and warm. She helped Juliet get undressed and pushed her into the stall, closing the door behind the other girl. The teen wizardess rummaged around looking for a clean washcloth. She knew that body wash and shampoo and conditioner were in the shower already.<p>"Here Juliet," Alex called, holding the washcloth over the top of the door. A mumbled reply was all she got. She cracked open the translucent door and peeked in. Juliet was leaning forward against the wall with the water beating on her. Her eyes were half closed and Alex thought she might fall asleep any moment standing up.<p>A playful smile danced across Alex's lips as she decided to kill two birds with one stone. She yanked off her own clothes and made sure there were lots of towels handy. Then she slipped into the shower.<p>"Hi there," Alex whispered as she dribbled body wash across Juliet's back and began to run the washcloth over the smooth skin.<p>"Hi yourself," mumbled Juliet. "Oh that feels good."<p>Alex industriously scrubbed Juliet's back. The washcloth and her hands worked down, gently circling the other teen's firm little bottom and then the back of her thighs. The dark haired girl grinned as Juliet moaned softly and her feet slid apart. She brought her hands around Juliet's waist, brushing the washcloth for just a moment between her legs before turning her attention to the flat tummy.<p>"Alex, oh my." The long haired brunette appeared to be waking up quite a bit as Alex molded her body against the other girl's back. The washcloth dropped to the floor and Alex's fingers began to dance over two rounded breasts and tease the pink tips that were already hardening before Alex touched them.<p>Juliet rolled her hips, rubbing her bottom back against Alex, who obligingly spread her own legs. The warm water cascading over their bodies from the shower was mingled with another wetness that coated one girl's tight rear end and the other's juncture as they ground harder against each other.<p>Alex ran her tongue up Juliet's neck to her ear. She blew in it and darted her tongue into the opening. "Feels like these little things have woken back up," she observed as she gently tugged on the now very hard nipples.<p>Juliet worked her back muscles, flexing them against the two similar points that scraped against her back. "I'd say they aren't the only ones," she replied.<p>Alex rained kisses up and down Juliet's neck and shoulders. Giggling, she nipped the ex-vampire teen's neck, pretending to bite her. Then she brushed the long wet hair away from the back of her girl's neck and kissed there. And she didn't stop. Maintaining the pressure of her body against Juliet her lips worked their way down. By the time Alex reached the small of the other girl's back she had settled on her knees and the two diamond-hard tips of her breasts were pressing against the back of Juliet's thighs.<p>Since Alex no long had her hands where they could reach Juliet's breasts the other girl had replaced them with her own. She cupped them, briskly strumming the nipples with her thumbs. The hands that had been there before were busy. They gripped the taut cheeks of Juliet s bottom. Alex kissed the center of each cheek and then spread them.<p>For a moment Alex drank in the view of Juliet' perfect tight bottom. She drug her tongue down between the little globes of Juliet's butt, pausing only to flick her tongue at the puckered opening. Juliet's knees threatened to give way and she gave a cry muffled only by the shower. Without hesitation Alex spun the other teen around. The light brown hair of Juliet's triangle was darkened by the mixture of streaming water and flowing nectar. Without wasting a second Alex gripped her lover's hips and buried her face into the other girl.<p>Juliet cried out again. She bucked, she squirmed, she locked her hands in Alex's hair. It felt like the other wizardess' tongue was a foot deep inside of her and could fill her completely. Then the tip of that beloved invader found the throbbing hardness of her secret nubbin and Juliet was lost in the sweetness of a crashing orgasm. Neither teen saw the glowing white light that radiated from their joined bodies and filled the shower stall for just an instant during the height of their passion.<p>By the time the teen had recovered Alex was back on her feet, the water was off and she was being covered in towels. The girls patted each other dry and took turns with each other's hair. Giggling and touching so much the job seemed to take three times as long as it should; they helped each other dress in jeans and loose tops.<p>"Oh that was lovely," sighed Juliet. "Now what?"<p>"Dinner," replied Alex.<p>"Food? Oh my gosh. FOOD." the ex-vampire marveled. "I'm starved!"<p>(To Be Continued)
