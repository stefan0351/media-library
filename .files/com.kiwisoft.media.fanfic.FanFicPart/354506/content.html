<!-- Legend \ Chapter 15: Prelude to Darkness -->

<p>Hatred filled the master vampyre’s eyes as he paced back and
forth accrosed the main room of his lair, He could barely believe what had
happened. The witch was indeed powerful but the slayer , as she held her
sword and it played it’s deadly melody for all to hear
had frightened him, and that was simply was not suppose to happen. He was
Vlad Tepes Dracul, the master of all vampyre, it was he who
brought fear to the hearts of all who crossed his path. Vlad
slammed his fist through the concert wall of the lair as he screamed
out in pure rage, "She is only a girl and I will destroy her."</p>

<p>Buffy stood there watching Willow as she sat at on their bed. The
redhead smiled at her and got up and walked over to her and wrapped
her arms around her Buffy, "A penny for your thoughts"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking about what happened tonight, and about me
getting a vest"</p>

<p>Willow took a step back from Her love and gave the blonde her best
resolve face "You're not changing your mind, are you?"</p>

<p>Buffy placed her hands on the redheads shoulders and began to softly
massage them as she spoke, "I am still going to get a vest but
your getting one too."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You're taking the same risk I am by going out there, so your
getting a vest," Replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"Then I guess it is vests all around," answered Willow as she
stepped back up to Buffy and once again wrapped her arms around the blonde.</p>

<p>Buffy softly pressed her lips against Willow, "I love you"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I kinda figured that. I love you too" replied Willow
before she returned Buffy’s kiss.</p>

<p>Eamonn looked around the table at Collin and the watchers, after he
had looked each one of them in the eyes the druid high priest
spoke, "I believe you have a few questions for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, we do. It is about Ms. Summers and Ms. Rosenberg,"
replied Collin</p>

<p>"You mean the Bladesinger and her champion," corrected Eamonn.</p>

<p>"Actually that is part of our question, what exactly is happening
here. I know you said that Ms. Summers is the Bladesinger, and that
Ms. Rosenberg is her champion but what exactly does that all
mean."</p>

<p>"As I have already told you, The Bladesinger is the chosen
warrior of the blessed Goddess. Her destiny is to forever seal the
Hellsmouths, but she can not do that alone. She needs a champion,
someone to care for her, to magically protect her, and to fight by
her side. Does that help any."</p>

<p>"Not really, you only repeated what you said earlier"</p>

<p>Eamonn’s face showed nothing but seriousness as he looked Collin
dead in the eyes, "I have told you everything you need to know, if you wish
anymore knowledge of Bladesinger and her champion I suggest you take it up
with the Goddess."</p>

<p>Collin was now extremely frustrated from the lack of information they
were getting from the druid and it showed as he spoke, "How are
we to aid them if we do not understand fully what they have become. It is
our duty as council members and watchers to guide and train the
slayer, we can not do that if we do not what her abilities are."</p>

<p>"You are to aid them as you have been doing over the last several
days. Support the Bladesinger and her champion, do your research to
help unravel the mystery of the master vampyre, and help on the
patrols." Eamonn then stood up and placed both his hands on the
table, he leaned over towards Collin maintaining eye contact the
whole way, "That however is where your responsibilities and
duties end. You barely understand the slayers, do you really think the
Goddess would allow you to watch over those she has called. The
council is neither capable nor worthy to oversee the Bladesinger and
her champion, That is why I was sent."</p>

<p>Collin leaned back in his chair, the world as he knew seemed to end
as the druid high priest spoke, everything that he had dedicated his
life to now appeared to be over, they were no longer needed.
Collin looked around the table at his comrades, the looks of
despair on their faces told him that he was not alone, "What
are we suppose to do when this is all over, being watchers is all we
know."</p>

<p>"Most of you will do as you have always done and oversee the
slayers"</p>

<p>"I don’t understand, you just said that you were sent by the
Goddess to do that."</p>

<p>"No, you are mistaken. I said I was sent for the Bladesinger and
her champion, I said nothing of the slayers."</p>

<p>"But Ms. Summers is the currant slayer"</p>

<p>Eamonn's was becoming agitated by the fact that Collin didn;t seem to grasp
what he was saying, "No she is the Bladesinger, there is no active slayer at
this time," He pusaed for a moment and continued, "but in time one will be
called."</p>

<p>Eamonn then turned away from Collin and looked at Giles, "Do you
recall when I said that most of you would continue as you always
have"</p>

<p>"Yes" responded Giles, unsure of where this was going.</p>

<p>"It is time for us to talk," replied Eamonn as he motioned
for Giles to follow him.</p>

<p>Vlad had been sitting by himself for hours going over in his mind
what he had saw and trying to formulate a plan on how he could
destroy the two girls. Suddenly it jumped straight up from his seat
and spun around in mid air. When the master vampyre landed on the
ground he was looking Directly at Spike, "William, I know how to
destroy them"</p>

<p>"How master"</p>

<p>A sinister grin came accrosed Vlad’s face, "I will use the
Hellsmouth against them. I will open it and allow just enough of the demons
through to weaken the witch and the slayer. Then I will close it and wait
for the two of them to become weak from the fighting , then I shall destroy
them."</p>

<p>"Master, I do not understand why you would wish to close the
Hellsmouth once you have opened it"</p>

<p>"The demons of the Hellsmouth are not my children, the are
beneath me and have no place in the new order," Vlad walked over to the
blonde vampire and continued, "Know these truths William, we are
vampyre, the rulers of the night, all other creatures are subservient to us.
I will use the demons to accomplish what I need them to but beyond that I
have no use for them."</p>

<p>Vlad then walked away from Spike and lifted his hands above his
head, "The world will be mine alone to rule, and in the end there can
only be vampyre."</p>

<p>As the group was preparing for another night of patrolling Buffy and
Willow cornered Angel and Cordelia, "We have a question for
you," stated Buffy.</p>

<p>"Go Ahead," Replied Angel</p>

<p>"What‘s up:"</p>

<p>"You will have to be a little more specific, Buffy," stated
Angel, even though he knew where the blonde was headed..</p>

<p>"What's going on, with the two of you?"</p>

<p>Angel looked at Cordelia who gave him the nod to go ahead,,
"It’s complicated"</p>

<p>"Since when is anything about you not complicated, now spill"</p>

<p>"We are in love with her"</p>

<p>Cordelia grabbed Angel by the hand then spoke, "It’s true, we
both just recently realized that we love one another"</p>

<p>Willow looked at them and smiled, "That's great, we‘re happy
for you"</p>

<p>"Buffy then cut in on Willow, "Just keep good care of each
other."</p>

<p>"We will," Angel and Cordelia said in unison, both of them
pleased that their friends were supporting them.</p>

<p>Joyce and Shelia now sat at the table making small talk as they tried
to take their minds off the fact that Buffy and Willow were out there
in the darkness with the monsters that roamed the night. It was hard
on them as when they had to watch their daughters walk out that door,
knowing that they might not make it back.. They had both come to
realize that Buffy and Willow had to do what they did and were proud
of them for it, but still that didn’t make the waiting any easier.
The two women dreaded it when the sun had went down once again
because it had sent out their daughters to once again brave the
night and face the master vampyre and his children.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow both sported their newly acquired body armor as they
once again walked hand and hand on patrol. As the group made its way
towards the campus Giles was finding it difficult to focus on the
task at hand. Eamonn's words were playing over and over in his
mind, the druid had said that it was not his destiny to be a
watcher, that he like Buffy and Willow had a higher purpose to
fulfill. That he stood at the gateway of a new life and the time was
fast approaching for him to claim his destiny. Giles was unsure of
what Eamonn was talking about because the druid had ended the
conversation by saying that now was not the time to reveal his
calling and that they would talk again more in the morning, so now
all he could do was wait and wonder about what laid on the road ahead
of him.</p>

<p>On the other side of town, Vlad and Spike stood in front of the high
school. The master vampyre looked at Spike and spoke, "So
William
this is where the Hellsmouth is its weakest."</p>

<p>"Yes Master"</p>

<p>"Then shall we begin"</p>
