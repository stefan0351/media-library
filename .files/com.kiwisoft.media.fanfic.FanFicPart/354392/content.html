<!-- Interludis Neanderthalensis \ Part Two -->

<p>Willow sighed heavily, wondering how she'd gotten herself into this
particular mess. Apparently, she didn't move quickly enough for Cave-Slayer, because she
suddenly found her hand grabbed, and a moment later, she was being hauled through the
hallway.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the showers were dark and empty. Apparently, sometimes her fellow students did
actually sleep during the wee hours of the morning...or at least, they did if it was close
enough to dawn. </p>

<p>The shower cubicles had metal doors akin to most bathroom stalls and Willow tossed her
robe and nightshirt over one of the stall doors and hooked her toiletries on the shower
head, then turned back to face Buffy, who was watching curiously. &quot;You stay
there,&quot; she instructed firmly as she made a &quot;stay&quot; motion with her hand.</p>

<p>Buffy blinked.</p>

<p>&quot;Stay?&quot; Willow repeated. &quot;You understand stay?&quot;</p>

<p>Another blink.</p>

<p>Willow finally shrugged. &quot;I'll be back in a few minutes,&quot; she said, hoping Buffy
had understood. She kicked off her shoes, leaving them outside the stall, then stepped
inside, latching the door before she began peeling off her clothes and tossing them over
the door. God, she was exhausted. Just plain bone exhausted. Her head hurt where she'd
been hit, and she felt like her brain had swelled to twice its normal size and was trying
to escape the prison of her own cranium. The pressure wasn't pleasant. She turned on the
water, leaning into the spray as she let the water sluice over her body. Any intentions to
make the shower cold fled as soon as she felt the slick heat work its relaxing magic on
her overstressed muscles. Willow folded her arms against the wall over her head, leaning
heavily. Finally, she reached for the flowery smelling soap she used and absently began
lathering her grimy skin, one arm still braced against the wall, her forehead resting
against her forearm, letting her body relax. She didn't realize she was no longer alone
until she heard Buffy's excited voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Foamy,&quot; the Slayer enthused.</p>

<p>Willow yelped and spun, nearly going down on the slick tile, as her eyes dropped to the
slender figure sliding through the narrow space under the metal stall door.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, what are you--&quot; Willow automatically folded her arms across her bare
torso as she blushed bright pink.</p>

<p>Buffy easily pushed to her feet, not seeming to notice the suddenly crowded nature of the
shower stall. &quot;Foamy,&quot; Cave-Slayer repeated as she stared at the white lather
that dotted Willow's pale skin. Water was turning her lightweight clothes transparent,
making Willow very aware of Buffy's body.</p>

<p>&quot;No, Buffy, it's not--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Foamy,&quot; Buffy repeated happily and stuffed her nose into the rich lather, only
to jerk back, spitting disgustedly. &quot;Blech. Not like beer...bad, bad foamies.&quot;
She sneezed violently.</p>

<p>Willow swallowed hard, shaken by the brief contact. &quot;It's soap,&quot; she explained,
uncertain how much of the concept might get through Buffy's primitive brain. &quot;For
getting clean.&quot; She rubbed the bar against her arm to demonstrate the concept.</p>

<p>The Slayer's brows drew together as she studied the process with feral curiosity. Her eyes
lifted suspiciously. &quot;Not beer,&quot; she muttered unhappily. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Willow agreed. &quot;Not beer, but it smells nice and gets you
clean.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy leaned down and sniffed Willow's arm, not noticing the way the hacker stiffened</p>

<p>Buffy stared at Willow. &quot;Clean?&quot; she repeated uncertainly, then looked down at
her own arm, lifting it to sniff her grimy skin. Her nose wrinkled. &quot;Buffy smell
bad.&quot; She leaned close to Willow, who leaned back as far as possible in the scant
space offered by the shower stall. &quot;Will-ow smell good.&quot; She reached out,
delicately touching a single finger to Willow's soapy shoulder and slowly moved the lather
round and round, watching the way it loosened the dirt. Apparently, the concept suddenly
got through because she grinned proudly. &quot;Clean.&quot; And snatched the soap out of
Willow's hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Th-that's good,&quot; Willow encouraged uncertainly. &quot;You--you can use the next
stall...just take the soap. It's yours.&quot; She just wanted Buffy out of the stall so
she could finish her shower. Besides, having Buffy there in transparent clothes, while she
was wearing nothing more than foam and a smile was not good for her peace of mind. </p>

<p>But Buffy ignored Willow's words, instead grabbing her friend's wrist and tugging her arm
out as she began lathering her inner wrist, fascinated by the foamy bubbles produced by
the soap. After a moment, she tugged Willow's arm up to her nose and gave it a hearty
sniff, then loudly proclaimed, &quot;Smell good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you just--&quot; Willow started to try and talk Buffy into using the next stall
again, but she never had a chance. Instead, Buffy began rubbing the soap everywhere with
childlike abandon, innocently unaware of the trails of heat she was leaving on Willow's
skin. The hacker tried once or twice to bat Buffy's hands away, but was no match for the
determined Cave-Slayer who was so focused she didn't even notice her friend's efforts.</p>

<p>Laughing, fascinated by the way the soap bubbled and washed away the dirt, Buffy merrily
spread the thick foam anywhere and everywhere, while Willow at first tried to resist
between ticklish twitches before finally surrendering to Buffy's insistent enthusiasm.
Besides, it felt good and she was so tired. Closing her eyes, Willow accepted the
inevitable and let her chin fall against her chest as she tried to ignore the slow burn
arousal flooding through her veins. As tired as she was, it was the best she could do. Her
head jerked up long minutes later when the soap was suddenly thrust under her nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Clean Buffy,&quot; Buffy instructed in what was the Cave-Slayer's signature emphatic
style.</p>

<p>Concluding it was the most likely to get things over with quickly, Willow began soaping
down Buffy's bare arms while valiantly trying to ignore the firm muscles that rippled in
the wake of her touch and how good Buffy's skin felt under her fingertips.</p>

<p>&quot;Not right,&quot; Buffy suddenly muttered while peering down at herself. Then
suddenly she grinned, and began tearing off her sodden clothes, dropping them carelessly
to the floor of the shower. Apparently, modesty was not an inherent Cave-Slayer trait.
&quot;Clean,&quot; she instructed Willow and caught the hand holding the soap, pressing it
against her chest and moving it around. &quot;Clean,&quot; she repeated.</p>

<p>Despite her best intentions, Willow couldn't resist the temptation to stroke soft skin and
explore smooth curves and Buffy certainly seemed to enjoyed the experience, though it was
more innocently sensual than openly erotic. Perhaps it was the wide-eyed wonder with which
Buffy watched the process or perhaps it was the innocence of the emotion that underlaid
their every interaction. </p>

<p>When Willow finally set aside the soap, Cave-Slayer started to protest, but then became
fascinated again as Willow introduced her to the wonders of shampoo. </p>

<p>At least she enjoyed the simple things in life, Willow decided with characteristic
practicality as she massaged shampoo into the Slayer's matted locks. When she was
finished, Buffy abruptly turned to face her again, reaching out to finger a few strands of
crimson hair where they framed Willow's face. &quot;Not clean,&quot; she decided out loud,
then reached for the shampoo bottle, fumbling with it until she finally got some of the
liquid soap on her fingers. She reached out and began massaging the thick soap into
Willow's hair, stretching her fingers and working them through the silky strands.</p>

<p>&quot;Feels nice,&quot; Buffy proclaimed after a minute or two. She toyed with a strand of
Willow's hair. &quot;Soft.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow jerked herself out of the pleasant reverie where she'd lost herself during the
unintentionally erotic scalp massage, suddenly remembering their mutual nudity. &quot;Um,
thanks...but we really should get dressed.&quot; She shut the water off with a sharp twist
of her wrist, then grabbed for her nightshirt, yanking it on over her head despite the
fact that she hadn't dried off, making the fabric cling uncomfortably to her skin. </p>

<p>Buffy frowned in confusion while Willow eyed the clothes lying in the bottom of the shower
with a raised brow. Well, there wasn't going to be any way to get Buffy back into those
anytime soon. &quot;Here, you can wear my robe,&quot; she decided as she reached for the
garment. </p>

<p>The idea did not appeal to Buffy in the least and it took considerable coaxing to get
Cave-Slayer into the lightweight terrycloth garment. But finally, Buffy allowed Willow to
tie the cloth belt around her narrow waist, though her expression was screwed into a
primitive pout.</p>

<p>At least the process of getting Buffy back to their dorm room went reasonably smoothly.
Apparently even Cave-Slayers eventually start to tire. &quot;Sleepy now,&quot; Buffy
mumbled through a yawn as Willow pulled her back into their room. Though the moment the
door slammed shut in their wake, Buffy was pulling at the belt tied around her waist.
&quot;No like,&quot; she muttered unhappily, then finally tore it loose, and dropped the
robe down off her shoulders, letting it fall to the floor in her wake.</p>

<p>Willow hurried after her friend, retrieving the dropped robe as she tried to think of a
way to get the Slayer back into it. It was like dealing with a particularly recalcitrant
two year old...who could probably rip her arms out of her sockets without even putting any
effort into it--Willow frowned as her eyes traced the lines of her friend's sculpted
narrow back--and who possibly had the most gorgeous naked body she'd ever seen in her
life. <i>Bad, bad, bad thoughts</i>, she mentally chastised herself. Her pulse leapt
another notch as Buffy turned to face her, seemingly careless of her nudity.</p>

<p>&quot;Sleep now,&quot; the Slayer pronounced and plopped down onto Willow's bed as though
it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;You,&quot; Willow pointed at the Slayer, &quot;Sleep there,&quot; she explained,
gesturing toward Buffy's bed.</p>

<p>Buffy was already tunneling into the blankets. &quot;Sleep now,&quot; she repeated
impatiently and patted the mattress hard enough to make Willow wonder if her box springs
had survived the experience.</p>

<p>Willow tried to make Buffy see how things were one more time. &quot;I sleep there.&quot;
She swung her hand around to point at the Slayer's mattress. &quot;You sleep there.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy yawned and blinked sleepily, showing no sign of comprehension. &quot;Sleep,&quot;
she repeated.</p>

<p>Willow sighed, shoulders slumping. &quot;You just go ahead and take that bed,&quot; she
muttered and turned toward Buffy's side of the room. &quot;I'll take yours tonight.&quot;
She flipped off the overhead lights then tugged back the covers on Buffy's bed, very aware
of the smell of her friend's perfume and shampoo as she slid between her sheets. It was
strangely comforting to be surrounded by her best friend's familiar smell after the
everything that had been happening lately, though in a sort of disturbing way. Willow
sighed softly, wishing she could just stop thinking for a few hours. She was still lying
there musing on how much easier life would be if she could just escape her own thoughts,
which never seemed to stick to the paths which would have kept things easier, when the
covers were yanked back.</p>

<p>&quot;Sleep,&quot; Buffy said, sounding annoyed, and then hooked an arm around Willow's
waist.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, what are you--&quot; the hacker yelped as she found herself slung up over the
Cave-Slayer's shoulder. &quot;Now, wait. This sort of thing is one thing when I'm
unconscious and you're saving my life, but--&quot; Her words ended in a short grunt as
Buffy dropped her lightly on her mattress. &quot;It's not at all the same when we're
talking bedtime in our dorm room,&quot; Willow finished after only the briefest pause to
catch her breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Sleep now,&quot; Buffy said as though Willow hadn't even spoken and plopped down
onto the mattress next to her roommate.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, I...&quot; Willow started to try to rationally discuss the situation, only to
find herself snuggled into strong arms, her back pressed against rounded curves, while
Buffy tugged the blankets up over both of them.</p>

<p>&quot;Will-ow talk too much,&quot; Cave-Slayer mumbled near her ear, her warm breath
teasing Willow's neck. &quot;Sleep now.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow lay stiffly, unable to think of anything but the warm curves pressed against her
back and the heated kisses she'd traded with Buffy earlier that evening. She half expected
to feel those powerful hands to touch her the way Oz did, to slide over her skin, stroking
and caressing, to feed the heat already seeping through her veins. Instead, they simply
fit snugly to her belly and one hip, holding her close. Willow didn't know whether to be
relieved that she wasn't going to have to find the intestinal fortitude to repel her
friend's advances or disappointed that Buffy apparently wasn't going to make any advances
for her to repel.</p>

<p>Buffy snuggled deeper into the blankets, nuzzling Willow's neck. &quot;Smell nice,&quot;
she mumbled, then fell silent, at least for the few minutes before her breathing deepened
and slowed, turning to soft snorts that weren't quite snoring.</p>

<p>Willow felt her muscles relax as she realized nothing was going to happen, not that she
had ever been afraid Buffy would force her or hurt her in any way she realized in a rush.
Not even the Cave-Slayer made her feel threatened. She exhaled heavily, huddling into the
comforting weight of the arms wrapped around her, feeling safer and more protected than
she could remember feeling in--Willow frowned, a funny sense of deja vu sending a frisson
of awareness down her spine--in a long time, she decided at last. An unsettling half
memory teased the edges of her consciousness, more a flash of sensory impression than
anything concrete, a sense that she'd felt the softness of Buffy's kisses once
before--Willow blinked as the sensation passed--which was ridiculous. It was probably just
the bump on the head, she decided at last. Freshmanhood, Oz's recent bout of more than
usual oddness, and now the Cave-Slayer were all just weirding her out. She sighed heavily,
sleep threatening to overcome her exhausted and battered frame. That was all it was.
Lulled by the most common of buoys, false confidence, she slid off into the welcome arms
of sleep, held safely in the protective arms of her best friend.</font></p>
