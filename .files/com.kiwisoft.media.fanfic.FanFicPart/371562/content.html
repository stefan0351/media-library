<P>As Olivia was distracted looking at the door that Viola had just slammed, Sebastian pulled her off Duke and Duke hide behind the nearest piece of furniture. Sebastian held onto Olivia as once again her mood changed dramatically, she broke down in his arms, crying on his shoulder.</p>
<P>"How is she?", asked Sebastian as he held onto Olivia's still crying form.</p>
<P>Duke looked worriedly at Olivia and climbed out from behind the table, he had taken refuge under.</p>
<P>"Pretty much like that", said Duke pointing to Olivia.</p>
<P>Olivia looked up at Duke. Duke put his hands up signaling that he was not a threat. Olivia nodded and moved closer to Duke, Sebastian stood nearby for back up as Olivia pulled Duke into a hug.</p>
<P>"I'm so sorry Duke", said Olivia, beginning to cry into Duke.</p>
<P>Duke patted Olivia on the back, he wasn't used to being attacked and then hugged, all within a minute.</p>
<P>"Its okay Olivia", said Duke, questioning Sebastian with his eyes, Sebastian just shrugged and pointed at the door to Viola's room. Duke nodded.</p>
<P>"You know Olivia, I think you should really talk to Viola", said Duke.</p>
<P>Olivia looked up at him and then turned to face the door he was motioning towards, he helped her take a few steps towards it, supporting her weight as she tried to inch away from the door.</p>
<P>"I think you should", said Sebastian, motioning to the knob.</p>
<P>Olivia looked down at it, one piece of metal, and a whole lot of wood, blocked her from Viola. Duke moved his hand under Olivia's arm and took her hand, resting it on the knob he moved away slowly, allowing Olivia to take her own weight and to stand, holding onto knob.</p>
<P>Duke motioned to Sebastian, who took the cue and followed Duke out the front door, Olivia watched them go, reminding herself to thank them, when she was finished. Looking back at the little knob Olivia wondered how long it would take till she would be brave enough to try it.</p>
<P>After some minutes that felt like hours Olivia turned the knob and opened the door, stepping in, she closed it behind her, and took in the dark room. The shades were pulled down, and the room was cast in eerie shadows, the whole room screamed <I>break up</I> disaster. Olivia stepped in further only to feel something underneath her foot, looking down she took in the sight of the whole floor covered in used tissues, there was a trail that lead to the bed.</p>
<P>Olivia looked up at the lump, that was almost completely covered in tissues, as she watched another tissue flew up to land on top of the pile, underneath Viola sniffled. Olivia moved towards the bed and sat on the edge, next to the lump.</p>
<P>"Duke... I said I didn't want to be disturbed", said Viola weakly, when Duke didn't respond she turned around, as Olivia smiled down at her.</p>
<P>"What do you want?", asked Viola rolling back over.</p>
<P>"Cause Sebastian already thanked me", said Viola, crossly.</p>
<P>Olivia winced.</p>
<P>"Well that was probably before I broke up with him", replied Olivia softly.</p>
<P>Viola just managed to stop herself from rolling back to smile at Olivia, instead she lay there smiling to herself as Olivia continued.</p>
<P>"I told him that... damn this was hard enough the first time... I told Sebastian that I love you", said Olivia in a rush. Viola's smile grew, but she still refused to turn around.</p>
<P>"I just couldn't lie anymore and I totally understand if you don't feel the same. I mean I got all jealous over nothing even when were not in a relationship, I even tried to kill Duke", said Olivia pointing towards the door.</p>
<P>"I'd probably be the worst girlfriend ever but your... I just... I love you and I want you... even just as friends", Olivia said the last part softly, praying it would not come to that.</p>
<P>"Well I've said all I wanted to say", said Olivia rising.</p>
<P>"Call me when you feel better", said Olivia going to leave, as she got to the door Viola spoke.</p>
<P>"Liv wait", said Viola moving out from underneath the covers she sat up, and from her red eyes it was obvious she had been crying for a while.</p>
<P>"Did you mean that?", asked Viola smiling, Olivia moved back towards the bed.</p>
<P>"Every word", said Olivia.</p>
<P>"So you really tried to take out Duke", said Viola with a laugh, Olivia smiled she hadn't heard that laugh in a long time, too long.</p>
<P>"Yeah it wasn't easy", said Olivia sitting down in space next to Viola.</p>
<P>"So do you deserve to be forgiven?", asked Viola, looking over at Olivia.</p>
<P>"Vi all I want is your friendship", said Olivia, looking sincerely.</p>
<P>"I'm pretty sure you want more than that", said Viola laughing at Olivia's expression.</p>
<P>"Yeah but only if your comfortable because I was thinking..." Olivia was about to continue, when  Viola silenced her.</p>
<P>"Olivia you think too much, just let it flow", said Viola, moving closer to Olivia, Olivia was about to speak again when Viola pushed their lips together.</p>
<P>Pulling apart Viola repeated herself.</p>
<P>"Just let it flow", said Viola, Olivia took the advice this time and pulled Viola into a searing kiss, wrapping her arms around Viola's neck, Viola moved her arms around Olivia's waist and gently pushed her down into the bed, laying beside her. As they continued to kiss, Olivia thought over the whole situation they had been through, till Viola again pulled away.</p>
<P>"Don't think", said Viola, reading Olivia's mind.</p>
<P>Olivia laughed and unbuttoned Viola's shirt, Viola continued to kiss Olivia, as she fiddled with the buttons, and through out the afternoon, Viola and Olivia reached their final stage of intimacy, with each other this time.</p>
<P>Duke and Sebastian reappeared sometime later, after knocking on the door and in response hearing Viola's name shouted in pure ecstasy, they had left quickly. When it was safe they had ventured back and all four enjoyed a light dinner. Duke and Sebastian appeared to have bonded over their mutual wounds and had decided to go out "chick cruising" later that night, they had extended an invitation to Viola, who had politely refused.</p>
<P>Duke and Sebastian however did not give up so easily and continued to hassle her, until Olivia understood what the topic was and threw a piece of salad at each boy. They had taken that as their cue to leave the new couple alone, and Viola and Olivia had curled up on the couch to watch TV, before falling asleep in each others arms.</p>
<P>Which is where they both belonged, curled up with the other.. Joel would have been so proud</p>
<P>THE END</p>
