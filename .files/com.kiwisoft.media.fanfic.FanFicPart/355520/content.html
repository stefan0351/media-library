<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 11 -->

<p>"Late as always," Dillon greeted grasping
Katie's hand and pulling her unceremoniously into the apartment. "Luckily for
you, you manage to make it fashionable."</p>

<p>"Luck has nothing to do with it," Katie replied
flinging her coat at the other woman with a wink. The apartment was filled with the sounds
of voices, laughter and music. It sounded like a good party, she was almost sorry she had
been late.</p>

<p>"Please," Dillon said rolling her eyes. "You
still haven't figured out how to set your watch properly," she said motioning
for Katie to follow her into the other room.</p>

<p>"What is properly?" Katie asked in a faux
philosophical tone, smiling as Dillon batted her on the arm. "What's the party
for anyway, I know it's good to have me back in Chicago but..."</p>

<p>"Shut up. It's not for you," Dillon replied.
"It's for me. It's all about me, me, me," she continued whisking two
glasses off of a nearby waiter's tray and handing one to Katie. "Paid for by
... not me," she went on cheerily. "Mr. Falk is now a very rich man thanks to
me, it's the least he could do."</p>

<p>"Any reason to throw a good party, right?" Katie
asked laughing. Back in Spain Dillon had been the only person able to keep up with her, it
amazed her that the other woman had seemingly been able to keep it up and hold on to her
original liver.</p>

<p>"Ah, sarcasm, so nice to see you too, K," Dillon
said leading her over to the kitchen where a congregation of people had gathered.
"I'm bored of talking to you know, bug your lawyer," she finished dropping
Katie off by Jessie's side and fluttering away into the crowd.</p>

<p>"I've never been to one of her parties
before," Jessie commented watching Dillon flutter off. "It doesn't bring
out the best side of her personality."</p>

<p>"Her personality has a best side?" Katie asked
looking over at Jessie, thinking that there were no words in the English language to
describe how utterly delectable the blonde looked. Dressed up, dressed down, barely
dressed, whatever the occasion Jessie always looked great.</p>

<p>"Vicious," the man beside Jessie commented,
drawing Katie's attention over to him. "I like that in a woman," he
continued extending his hand.</p>

<p>"Bryan Winters, Kathryn Singer," Jessie
introduced as Katie grasped the man's hand shaking firmly.</p>

<p>"Singer," he repeated before smiling. "Ah,
the creator of Dillon's fetish for mangos," he said causing Katie to look over
at Jessie questioningly. The blonde merely shrugged, but before Katie could ask Bryan what
he meant by that he continued talking. "It's a pleasure to finally meet
you."</p>

<p>Katie was about to delve into her grab bag of small talk,
when a voice coming from somewhere in the apartment started calling the Bryan and he
gracefully excused himself.</p>

<p>"So, you made it," Jessie commented popping a
cherry into her mouth as she watched Bryan scurry off. She really wasn't that sad to
see him go, she'd had about all the small talk she could handle for the evening.</p>

<p>"As if I would turn down an opportunity to spend time
with you," Katie replied looking over at Jessie to see her raise her eyebrow, no
doubt because of her tardiness. "I haven't figured out how to program my watch
properly," she finally admitted shoving the offending object in front of Jessie.</p>

<p>"That's so sad," Jessie said softly looking
up at her clearly meaning it. Katie glared at her. "Let me see it," Jessie
continued starting to feel bad for mocking her.</p>

<p>"Could I borrow her for a minute?" Dillon asked
sidling up beside Katie, but looking at Jessie. "We need to retire to my bedroom to
make mad, passionate love."</p>

<p>"Dillon!" said an older, slightly graying man as
she rose from where he had been crouched behind the counter, a fresh bottle of wine in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Heh," Dillon replied blushing uncomfortably.
"Hey dad. I was joking of course...cause the coats are in my room," she
continued with a smile, having recovered from the initial shock of seeing her father
there.</p>

<p>"You really not to stop saying things like that before
it gets back to Bart," he responded shaking his head at her before making his way
back into the crowd. He loved the girl he really did, she was the apple of his eye and all
of that, but she had a couple screws loose she did.</p>

<p>"Who's Bart?" Katie asked smiling.</p>

<p>"Nobody," Dillon replied looking after her
father.</p>

<p>"Bart Jenkins?" Jessie asked surprised. "Why
would anything get back to Bart Jenkins?"</p>

<p>"Who's Bart Jenkins?" Katie asked again.</p>

<p>"Nobody," Dillon replied again picking up
Katie's drink and downing it.</p>

<p>"He takes care of the firms investments," Jessie
said looking over at Katie, knowing that the woman would keep asking the same question
until she got an answer.</p>

<p>"Why do we care about Bart?" Katie asked looking
back over at Dillon.</p>

<p>"Because he's my fucking finance alright,"
Dillon responded testily, glaring at both of them.</p>

<p>"Bart?!?" Jessie asked incredulously. "Bart
Jenkins?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bart, Bart Jenkins," Dillon replied leaning
against the counter. "He's not as dull as he looks," she muttered feeling
the need to defend her soon to be husband. It was one thing for her to make fun of him,
but another thing entire for two women she'd once hit on to do it. Bart was a great
guy, you just had to get to know him.</p>

<p>"Which one is he?" Katie asked surveying the
room. She had to get a look at his guy.</p>

<p>"Over there," Jessie said pointing over by the
window. "With the bow tie."</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Katie exclaimed upon spotting the
man in question. He was tall, which was good, and she had to admit rather good looking,
but never in a million years would she have picked him out as the man to make Dillon
settle down.</p>

<p>"I like the bow tie," Dillon grumbled
good-naturedly smiling slightly a moment later.</p>

<p>"And here I thought you were saving yourself for
me," Jessie replied resting her hand on Dillon's shoulder and squeezing
slightly.</p>

<p>Katie's head whipped around at that as she eyed the
quaint little scene before her. "You two dated?" she squeaked.</p>

<p>"We dated often," Dillon replied relaxed once
more, and playful now that she was sure her father wasn't anywhere around.
"Sometimes multiple times on the same night ... if you know what I mean, and I
think that you do," she continued winking suggestively.</p>

<p>Katie looked aghast upon hearing this her attention
flickering between Jessie who was biting her lip and Dillon who was looking lecherously
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Was that some kind of joke?" Katie asked looking
back over at Jessie whose body had started to shake as she continued to bite her lip.</p>

<p>"Of course it was," Dillon replied looking over
at Katie keenly. "Jessie knows I'm a scoundrel," she continued softly still
eyeing Katie while thinking that the other woman used to have a sense of humour.
"Hmmm," she exhaled a moment later. "Interesting."</p>

<p>"What is?" Jessie asked finally having gotten
herself under control. Katie was adorable when she got agitated or upset.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Dillon said absently, her attention
focused across the room. "I've gotta go rescue Bart, Bryan's talking to him
again," she and with that she fluttered off into the crowd again.</p>

<p>"So," Katie continued leaning against the
counter. "You two never dated then?" she went on in what she hoped was a casual
tone. She knew it had probably just been one of Dillon's stupid jokes, but since the
words had come out of the other woman's mouth she'd felt panicky and slightly
nauseous. She could safely say that she was not enjoying the feeling. Jealousy clearly
didn't suit her at all.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Jessie replied honestly,
watching Katie closely. She could tell that the other woman was trying to appear blasé
but she was failing miserably, and Jessie wondered what could have been bothering her, if
what she had said about never having been with Dillon was true. Lord knew that Katie had a
past, so she surely shouldn't have been getting uptight about hers - not that
there was anything to get uptight about in this case.</p>

<p>"What do you mean you don't know?" Katie
asked looking over at her incredulously. "How can you not know?"</p>

<p>"We've been out," Jessie replied her back
straightening slightly. "Whether they were dates, or friendly outings I'm not
sure. She's not the easiest person to read, you know, I mean she flirts with
inanimate objects," she continued. "Not that it's really your
business," she added picking up her glass.</p>

<p>Katie looked over at her and sighed. "You're
right," she said softly, her gaze wandering around the kitchen restlessly as she
tired to rein in her completely inappropriate feelings of resentment about the fact that
Jessie and Dillon may have gone out. "It's just..." she started to say,
and then stopped knowing that what she was about to say would have stepped over all sorts
of lines. Jessie was right, it was none of her business, they'd been broken up for
years, and they weren't even really together now. She had absolutely no right to be
quizzing Jessie or to be laying her jealously on her, especially considering the fact that
Jessie had been more than generous with not questioning her about her past.
"You're right," she repeated leaving them in an uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>"I fixed your watch," Jessie said a moment later
pushing the object back over to Katie.</p>

<p>"Thanks," the dirty blonde said, looking over at
Jessie and smiling softly before fixing the watch back to her wrist.</p>

<p>"You're welcome," Jessie responded smiling
back before lowering her gaze once more.</p>

<p>"You look nice," Katie continued glancing at
Jessie nervously though she already knew she'd been forgiven for her early
transgression.</p>

<p>"So do you," Jessie returned.</p>

<p>"You wanna go riffle through Dillon's underwear
drawer and raffle some off?" Katie asked her eyes focused on the countertop, looking
up only when she heard Jessie started to laugh. "I was serious," she continued
when Jessie continued to chuckle, shaking her head at her.</p>

<p>"I know," Jessie said sobering enough to speak,
but still smiling. "That's why it's funny."</p>
