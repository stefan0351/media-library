<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 24 -->

<p>The Admiral took a step back and looked at David.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! You really have brought a nest of spies, haven't you?"
the Admiral said to David. A little smile escaped David's lips.</p>

<p>"Well, that would depend on wether or not the collective noun for a
group of spies is a nest." he told the British Admiral. Without thinking
Xander opened his mouth.</p>

<p>"In this case it's a Scooby of spies." Xander said absently. Xander
was deafened by the sound of five sets of eyes blinking at him. David
recovered quickly to cover Xander's little goof.</p>

<p>"You will have to excuse Lieutenant Harris here, sir. Even his fellow
Americans find his sense of humour as strange. Isn't that correct Wing
Commander?" David asked his father. It took a second or two for Giles to
realise that David was talking to him.</p>

<p>"Oh! Yes. Most strange." Giles affirmed. The Admiral nodded, not quite
sure what to make of this motley crew.</p>

<p>"Yes, well. You must excuse me, my wife seems to want to have a word
with me. A pleasure to meet you all, and may you enjoy our hospitality." said
the Admiral as he made a bee line for his wife. After he had left, Buffy
whacked Xander on the arm.</p>

<p>"A Scooby of spies? What planet is you brain on?" she asked him.
Rubbing his arm, Xander frowned at Buffy.</p>

<p>"It just slipped out! Besides" Xander rounded on David. "What's with
the 'even his fellow Americans regard his sense of humour as strange'?"</p>

<p>"Look, I know the Admiral. He looks upon Americans as strange but
likeable cousins and Australians as crude but endearing. He's just a bit old
fashioned and needs a little understanding. Besides, now that's over with,
you lot should be out there enjoying the pomp and glamour of the ball. Now
shoo!" he said motioning for them to go. "Eat, drink, and be merry!" David
told them and them walked away towards the bar table. Giles blinked and then
smiled. He offered his arm to Buffy.</p>

<p>"May have this dance, Miss Summers?" he asked his Slayer in a way that
only an English gentleman could. A huge grin broke out on the Slayers face.
She took the offered arm.</p>

<p>"Most certainly, kind sir." she said and the pair headed off to the
dance floor. Willow and Xander watched them go. Xander turned to his friend.</p>

<p>"How about it Wills? Wanna dance?" he asked.</p>

<p>"OK. But no funny stuff, mister." she said in mock seriousness.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I wouldn't want the NSA to hunt me down and stake me,
would I?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The night was fantastic. The pomp, the glamour, the air of refinement
charmed the gang and the ride back to the hotel was full of talk about it.
The following days were full of sight seeing and shopping. Before they knew
it, the day that they had to appear before the Council had arrived.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The country manor that they had arrived at served as the headquarters
of the Watcher's Council. They were met by a smiling Albert.</p>

<p>"Rupert!" Albert cried and vigorously shook his hand. "You look so
well my friend!" Albert told Giles. Albert looked at Buffy.</p>

<p>"And I take it you are Buffy." Albert said with a grandfatherly smile.
Buffy took a liking to the old man right away.</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes I am." she said, a little smile covering the nerves she felt
at being here.</p>

<p>"Don't worry my child. You have many friends on the Council. Not all
of us approved your Watchers removal." he told her. He went onto Willow and
Xander.</p>

<p>"This must be Willow and Xander then. It is good to see the Slayers
friends being here for her." Albert said. He motioned for them to follow him.</p>

<p>They entered the manor and headed for the auditorium where the Council
had gathered to hear Buffy and her friends. Buffy stopped before the doors.</p>

<p>"What's the procedure here?" she asked Albert.</p>

<p>"Well, the Chief Watcher and the High Council will be sitting a the
table at the front of the room and the General Council will be seated as the
audience. You and Rupert will stand before the High Council and make you
case. The High Council and the General Council will then meet and decide.
Fear not, child. Many of the General Council share your concern and I think
that they might be able to persuade the High Council to grant your request."
Albert informed her. Buffy took a deep breath. She knew that she could
persuade the Council. The old man motioned to two young men standing by the
huge doors leading to the auditorium who opened them. Buffy and the rest
entered.</p>

<p>Everyone turned as they entered the room. At the end of the room was a
dozen men seated behind a large table. A man seated in the middle of the
table, presumably the High Watcher, spoke.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers. Rupert Giles. Please come forward." he said. Buffy and
Giles went forward and stood before the High Council. The High Watcher looked
at them closely.</p>

<p>"You stand here today, requesting the other Slayer be sent to
Sunnydale in order to battle this Murg Dor demon. The High Council and I have
considered this request and we refuse your request." Buffy and her friends
were shocked.</p>

<p>"Further more, it is the judgement of the High Council that both of
you are to be punished for your defiance of the Council. The punishment shall
be death."</p>
