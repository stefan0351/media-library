<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>The minutes seemed to drag on into hours as Alyssa waited to be called for her interview. She was taking a step out of her ordinary life and trying to get a position with a cruise line. Adventure and sailing the high seas for living was the ticket for her. No more working in the dull, dusty library of a small down where each day blended into the next. She was beginning to feel like one of the old worn out books that she watched being reshelved every day. Her job was the total sum of the Accounting Department, which basically meant that she was in charge of all accounts payable and receivable from overdue book fines to the purchase of new books. Each day she arrived at the library at dawn and didn't leave until dusk, putting in long hours as part of her duties. She was beginning to feel like one of the children of the night and her pale skin reflected this lack of sunlight. Her family consisted of her mother and father and two brothers, both of which worked construction alongside their father. Her mother remained a housewife, because that is what her father wanted. Alyssa had lived in this town for all of her 28 years and, although she was attractive, she never seemed to date anyone for very long. Her brother's told her that she was looking for Mr. Perfect and would never find anyone. Her mother's response was that she didn't have to settle for less either. Her mother had always been her source of encouragement and had made sure that she had gone to the community college to get her degree. She was happy with her life, but she didn't want her daughter to have to settle if it wasn't what she wanted to do with her life. Alyssa wasn't sure what she wanted to do, she just knew that working in the library wasn't it. So, when the Recruitment Fair came to the local community college, Alyssa was one of the first in line to get in. She walked along the booths that had been set up for various local and national recruiting organizations until she came to the Holiday Cruise Line booth. There as big as life, was a poster of the deck of a ship with a group of people standing in their starched white uniforms, tanned and smiling encouraging her to join them in their fun. ALYSSA walked directly toward the table and began to leaf through the brochures, before she knew it, a week later she was sitting in their offices in Miami waiting for her final interview before receiving her assignment. She had flown in this morning and had been met and taken directly to her hotel to register before being bussed to the Cruise Line's offices. She had never been to Miami, let alone Florida and couldn't wait to get out and see the sights.</p>
		<p>The door opened and Alyssa looked up as a tall dark-haired woman walked in. She had the most striking blue eyes that Alyssa had ever seen. The woman walked with an assured grace, comfortable in her tall body and with life in general. Her white shorts and pale blue polo shirt contrasted well against her firm tanned skin. Alyssa watched with in awe as she strolled over to the counter and leaned against it waiting for the woman behind it to look up.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Kelsey! It's been too long, welcome back! You ready for another tour at sea?" The receptionist looked up with unveiled interest. "We've missed you!" "Kelsey?"</p>
		<p>Kelsey looked around at all applicants that were waiting and thought, <i>'I'll just bet you have'</i>. Her attention was caught by a blonde in the corner who, to her embarrassment, was looking straight at her with a look all to familiar to Kelsey. She looked like a deer caught in the headlights, a 'newbie', scared to death and looking for adventure on the high seas. Unfortunately, what she would find is a lot of long hours and hard work for very little thanks. But, the pay was good and Kelsey loved the open air and the smell of the see so she kept coming back each season. Hearing her name called again, Kelsey turned back toward the receptionist. </p>
		<p>"Yes sorry, umm thanks Sandy...I guess I'm ready to head back out. The break never seems long enough though, does it?" Kelsey smiled down at the receptionist trying to be polite. She had continually rebuffed the woman's advances, but that didn't stop her from always trying. Kelsey wasn't interested in getting involved with anyone right now, at least not Sandy.</p>
		<p>"No, I guess it doesn't, but at least you aren't stuck behind this desk all the time." Sandy pulled out a packet and handed it to Kelsey. "Here is your room and duty assignments. Ship Orientation is tomorrow at 10 AM in the ODR (officers dining room), you are expected to board at 8 AM and get settled before the meeting." Kelsey nodded her understanding, nothing new just the usual routine.</p>
		<p>Sandy laid the packet on the top of the counter but didn't let it go when Kelsey tugged on it. Kelsey looked up questioningly into the hazel eyes and instantly knew what was coming. "If you aren't doing anything tonight, maybe we can get dinner and catch a movie before you ship out?"</p>
		<p>Kelsey plastered a look of regret on her face and shook her head, "Oh, I'm sorry. I've made plans to spend the evening with my aunt."</p>
		<p>Sandy didn't seem pleased as her eyes narrowed when she remarked. "I didn't know you had any family, you folder lists your parents as deceased."</p>
		<p>"Yes, they are. My aunt is my only living relative and is listed as my next of kin for emergency purposes." Kelsey replied trying hard to keep her solicitous look on her face. One of these days she was going to tell the woman off and be finished with her constant fishing expeditions, but she didn't want to jeopardize her assignments either. She knew that Sandy had pull when it came to the assignment of rooms and duties. Kelsey had tried every other way to let Sandy know that she just wasn't interested in her. It wasn't because she was a woman, because Kelsey was a lover of all things female, just not this one.</p>
		<p>"Maybe when you get back then." Sandy murmured and let go of the packet and Kelsey whisked it quickly away before turning and waving good-bye on her way out. <i>'Whew! Another reprieve!'</i></p>
		<p>Alyssa watched the interaction between the women and for some reason was happy when the tall one turned down the receptionist. She hadn't been real thrilled with the way the redhead had eyed here when she first came in, too pushy for Alyssa's taste. Alyssa had never dated a woman before, but the idea was far from foreign to her. There were little opportunities in her town, which was one of the reasons why she never had a date. Alyssa grinned thinking, <i>'If her brother's only knew!'</i> Caught in her daydream, she didn't hear her name called the first time. The second time she looked up and the receptionist was looking at her impatiently as she called her name again.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, that's me." Alyssa quickly rose and went toward the counter. Sandy looked at her curiously before shaking her head and giving her directions where to go for her interview. Nodding in understanding Alyssa finally thanked her and went down the hallway that the woman had indicated.</p>
		<p>"12-B, this must be the room." Alyssa mumbled to herself and smoothed out her shirt before knocking on the door and waiting for a response. She heard a muffled voice call come from behind the door and she turned the knob to open the door and enter. The room turned out to be a small conference room consisting of a table with a couple of chairs around it. Seated on the other side of the table was a man in an officer's uniform of the cruise line. He quickly stood smiling and looked down at the packet and then back at her and said, "You must be Alyssa..."</p>
		<p>"Yes, I am." Alyssa walked up to the table and stopped.</p>
		<p>The officer held his hand out for a handshake and introduced himself. "Great, I'm Mark, Chief Purser. Welcome to Holiday Cruise Lines. Please, have a seat."</p>
		<p>He waited until Alyssa was comfortably seated before beginning. "May I call you Alyssa? We run a pretty informal ship in the Pursers office."</p>
		<p>Alyssa nodded and replied, "Yes, Please do."</p>
		<p>"Great! I'm not sure how much they have told you, but should you accept this assignment you will be attached to the Pursers Office. With your background, we can certainly use you." Mark replied opening up the manila envelope with her name on it.</p>
		<p>"So, far all I've been told are the basics about employment, salary, benefits, etc. They told me I would learn about the job assignment itself at this interview." Alyssa leaned forward on the desk excited with the knowledge that she actually had the job if she wanted it. At the last interview, they had left her to believe that nothing was final until she received an actual assignment, and this was it!</p>
		<p>"Well, then let me tell you about your assignment then." Mark answered happily and began to turn the papers in Alyssa's direction so that she could follow along. "Your assignment, as I stated before, is with the Pursers Office. Your duties will include manning the Pursers Desk in the main atrium. Most of your role will be to act as a cashier of sorts, cashing checks, exchanging currency and things of this nature. You will rotate with three other Officers on a set schedule. We are all a pretty friendly group and I don't mind any switching of schedules between officers as long as it is noted on the rooster ahead of time. Other than that, at the end of each shift, the officer is expected to total out their transactions for the day and log them in the computer system. This will ensure that we have ample funds and various currencies available for the passengers. Most of which is kept in a safe and either myself or the Assistant Chief Purser, Monica have access to, and in rare emergencies, the captain. But, we don't like to trouble him with the day to day running of our office." Mark sat back smiling and waited for everything to sink in before continuing, "So, do you have any questions?"</p>
		<p>Alyssa thought for a moment before answer. It didn't sound like that difficult of a job to her and actually it might be fun to actually talk to the various passengers. In the library, she never got to talk to anyone. "Well, the job sounds good. You've seemed to explain it fully."</p>
		<p>"So, think you might be interested in joining us this season?" Mark waited for her response before going into the rest of the details of uniforms and rules.</p>
		<p>"Oh yes! I think I'd like that very much!" Alyssa was so happy that her smile must have stretched from ear to ear. She was going to sea!</p>
		<p>"Terrific!" Mark rubbed his hands together in excitement for the young woman. She seemed to be an easily likable person and would have no problem fitting in with his staff. "Okay, next let me tell you about your uniform, room assignment and the rest."</p>
		<p>Mark pulled out more papers from the envelope and went over them with Alyssa. Since this was her first season with the Cruise lines she had been assigned to room with an experienced officer who could show her the ropes. Alyssa had been assigned to bunk with the Assistant Sports Director for the duration of this cruise. It was the Cruise line's policy to mix their officers from the various departments so that everyone could get acquainted and also get to know how other parts of the ship operated. Mark signed her slip for her uniforms and after welcoming her again, sent her along on the next phase of her employee orientation. </p>
		<p>By late afternoon, all arrangements for uniforms and essentials, medical releases and paperwork had been filed and taken care of, and Alyssa was free until she was to report to the ship at 8 AM the next morning. Exhausted but exhilarated, Alyssa headed to her hotel room to call home and change. She wanted to get something to eat and check out the sights before it got to late. The call home was the hardest thing she would have to do. It was for sure now, that she would be gone for at least 12 months on this duty assignment. She wouldn't be able to see her family unless they booked passage aboard her assigned ship. She could call and write, but that was about all the she would have time to do. There were no side trips unless for an emergency.</p>
