<!-- The Better Life \ Chapter 6: Cause There's A Foot For Every Shoe -->

<p>Buffy snuck into her house, and was just getting into bed when she heard her stepmother come stumbling in.  She heard her laughing and bumping into things, all the while telling the man she was with to be quiet.  After a few minutes their voice disappeared behind the closed bedroom door.  As Buffy almost fell asleep she heard her sisters come in, she could hear Cordelia yelling at Dawn.</p>
<p>"God, you are so fat!  How could you get this drunk and make me carry you home?  You are so embarrassing, I should have brought Buffy with me!"</p>
<p>"Shhut up, I talked to Faith she liiiked meeee."  Dawn giggled.</p>
<p>"No she didn't she threw you back to your friends like the idiot you are, and ran off with that blonde girl.  What a slut she was."  Buffy heard Cordelia push Dawns door open and flop Dawn down on the bed.</p>
<p>"God, learn how to fucking drink."  Cordelia slammed Dawns door and walked down to her own room, Buffy heard her brushing her teeth before she drifted off into dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the weekend passed uneventfully for both Buffy and Faith.  Buffy spent her time cleaning (a nasty pile of vomit from Dawn), and cooking. Faith on the other hand spent her time lounging around the pool with Gavin, and Taz.  Monday morning came quick enough with Faith arriving early to school.  Gavin drove her as always and they sat now on one of the benches outside the school.</p>
<p>"So I told my dad about her," Faith informed Gavin.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?  How'd he take it?" Gavin handed her a doughnut from the bag they had picked up, and a coffee.</p>
<p>"Pretty well, I just told him how much I liked her, and he was enthused.  I mean not happy it was a girl, but happy I wanted to settle down some.  I think we're five by five."</p>
<p>"That's nice, so what's our plan now?"</p>
<p>"Yeah so, my dad, he asked the principal to call all the blonde seniors to the gym during lunch," Faith, said sipping her coffee.</p>
<p>"He did not!" Gavin said astounded.  "Is Snyder gonna do it?"</p>
<p>"What can I say, my dad holds a lot of weight with him, we're on for lunch, meet me in the gym," Faith stood up brushing crumbs off her shirt.</p>
<p>"You are too much Faith King." Gavin shook his head.</p>
<p>"And that's why you love me," Faith kissed Gavin's forehead, winked at him and sauntered off.  Gavin just shook his head at her and finished his breakfast.</p>
<p>Faith kept her eyes out for Buffy on the way to her first class, better avoid the whole shoe thing if possible, she even asked a few people if they knew her, but no one seemed to have any idea who she was talking about.  She stood looking over the hall until the bell rang, and even then still stood watching the stragglers, until her teacher Mr. Giles asked her to please sit.</p>
<p>"Now if I have everyones attention, can anyone tell me what the reading was about this weekend?" Mr Giles asked the class.</p>
<p>"A bloody load of crap," Spike shouted from the back of the class where he was lounging with the other morons, Faith shook his head at him.</p>
<p>"Ah, anyone else," Mr Giles attempted again.</p>
<p>"Fairy tales." Oz said without looking up.</p>
<p>"Yes, and what about them?" Mr Giles asked, pleased that it seemed someone had at least read the title of the chapter.</p>
<p>"Origin of."</p>
<p>"Very good, now if you could all.." Faith tuned out the rest of the class, zoning on Buffy.  The rest of her morning passed in a similar manner.  Faith only really paid attention between classes, hoping to spot Buffy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Buffy had been made late that morning by her stepmother who insisted she do the dishes before school, because she had a boyfriend coming for lunch.  So while her stepmother drove her sisters to school Buffy was left to wash the dishes, and even though she hurried she still didn't make it to school until halfway through first period.  She was made to sit in the office till first period was over, and as she was about to go, was treated to a lecture from Snyder, which lasted most of second.  She went quickly to her third and forth period class, which was chemistry, followed directly by lab, so she did not see Faith once.</p>
<p>As Buffy and her partner cleaned up their station after lunch an announcement came over the speaker, it was Mrs Summers, the secretary.</p>
<p>"Attention students, your principal has requested that all blonde senior females please report to the gym during lunch.  Thank you."  The students in Buffy's lab looked at each other in confusion at the odd announcement.  In Math class on the other side of the school Faith class was doing the same thing, except for Faith and Gavin who were both looking down at their desks trying not to make eye contact, or laugh.  Neither of them could hold it anymore once they got out of the room.</p>
<p>"Oh my god that was great, made Snyder sound like an idiot."  Faith lent against the lockers as Gavin put away his books.</p>
<p>"Yeah, or a perv,"Gavin added. He slung an arm over Faiths shoulders.   "Come on, let's find your honey."  They headed toward the gym.</p>
<p>Buffy finished cleaning her station after her partner left and after putting away her books headed for the gym.  Outside the doors she was accosted by her sisters.</p>
<p>"Hi Buffy, where are you going?"Dawn asked.</p>
<p>"To the gym, like the announcement said."</p>
<p>"Buffy, Buffy, they were not talking about you."Cordelia shook her head.</p>
<p>"How do you know?  They said all blonde senior females; hello here I am all three.  Now if you will excuse me." Buffy tried to step around them, but they each grabbed one of her arms and started pulling her down the hall.  "Hey, what are you doing?" Buffy struggled</p>
<p>"Well, you see we found out that Faith is in charge of this whole thing to find her bimbo from Friday night, and apparently, you fit the description."  Cordelia explained.</p>
<p>"And we are not giving you the chance to accidentally get mistaken for someone she likes."  Dawn added.  As she said this they were shoving Buffy into the janitors closet, closing it behind her they turned the lock, smiling they walked away.  Buffy threw herself against the door.</p>
<p>"Hey, this isn't funny, let me out!" She pounded on the door, but then slid to the floor crying, knowing now she would never have Faith.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Faith was busy having each of the girls try on the shoe.  One after another they tried, and though some were close, none of them fit the shoe exactly.  Faith was starting to feel like she was crazy.</p>
<p>"Ok. Gavin, you say Buffy too right?  And Taz?"  Faith asked in between two of the girls.</p>
<p>"Faith, I totally back you up on this girl being real.  Maybe she is just  absent today."  Gavin tried the shoe on the next girl, who it obviously did not fit.</p>
<p>"Thanks," the girl got up, and the next sat down.  Gavin looked around the gym..3 more to go.</p>
<p>Buffy was pacing the closet, well as much as she could pace.  This was so screwed up, she finally got a date with Faith, they had the perfect night, Faith was looking for her right now, and she was stuck in a janitor's closet.  Her damned stepsisters.  Ok this is dumb, no more.  In a fit of anger Buffy pulled back her leg, and kicked the door.  To her surprise she heard the lock snap and the door swung open, half off its top hinge.</p>
<p>"Whoa," Buffy looked at the damage she had just caused, and then took off at a run for the gym. "Uh Faith, I think that was the last girl," Gavin looked sadly down at Faith who was now sitting in the chair the girls had used.</p>
<p>"Can't we wait just a minute?  There could be some stragglers."  Faith looked at the door expectantly.</p>
<p>"We've already waited five.  Tomorrow we'll have them call anyone who was absent today down, ok?  Now come on, if we hurry we can still catch some Burger King," Gavin extended a hand down to Faith who slowly accepted it, allowing herself to be pulled up.  Together they walked toward the gym doors.</p>
<p>"Gavin, what if she was lying?  What if she doesn't go to this school?  What if I never see her ag.." Faith was interrupted as she turned the corner by a girl slamming right into her, she fell flat over.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry," Buffy said wincing.</p>
<p>"Hey, you didn't try on the shoe did you?" Gavin asked fishing it out of his bag.  "Didn't you hear the announcement?"</p>
<p>"I did, I just got caught up."  Buffy started to take off her shoe.  Faith stood up refusing to look at her, she was convinced that it was over, she would never find Buffy.  Gavin slowly slid the shoe onto Buffy's foot.  He looked up at Buffy in awe.</p>
<p>"It fits."</p>
