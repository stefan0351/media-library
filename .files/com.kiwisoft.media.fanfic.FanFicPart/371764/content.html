<P><B>so here's a new little story i thought i'd try. let me know what you think and if it's worth continuing.</B></P><P><B>by the way, if anyone knows Lilly's mom's real first name, please let me know. I can't remember it for anything! I keep thinking Heather, cuz the actress is Heather Locklier (I think?) Haha. So if you know Lilly's mom's first name, please tell me!</B></P><P><B>disclaimer: i do not own hannah montana or any part of it, obviously. if i did, the show would be like this. duhhhhhh.</B></P><P>"This sucks!" I exclaimed, throwing my hands in the air. "You're just trying to replace Mom! You never loved her! How could you!" Before he can refute what I said, I ran to my room, slamming the door behind me and locking it. Now way I'm talking to him right now.</P><P>Getting married? To some random chick? I don't even know her name; it's something Truscott. Blondie Truscott. That's good. Blondie. Blondie The Bitch Truscott. Damn I'm good.</P><P>Momma only died 7 years ago, when I was 10, and already he wants to remarry. Doesn't the man have any compassion?</P><P>I didn't even know he was dating anyone. Who the hell is Blondie Truscott? I've never even met the woman, the only reason I know she's blonde is 'cause he told me. And already her and her stupid daughter, something like Rose or Orchid, some kind of stupid flower, are moving in with us today. And they're getting married in six months. What the fuck!</P><P>I'm supposed to share a room with Tulip! I've never even met this chick and I'm supposed to give up half of my room to her? I. Don't. Fucking. Think. So.</P><P>"Miley Ray Cyrus, you are going to change that attitude and welcome Lilly and her mother into our house with open arms. You are going to share your room with Lilly and you are going to be happy about it!" My dad yelled through my door.</P><P>"Fuck you!" I screamed, kicking my door for emphasis.</P><P>He stalked off, I could hear him stomping away, muttering something about how he was going to ship me off to military school. Good luck with that, asshole.</P><P>I kicked my door again. Then again. And again. But, I decided to be considerate, and took into account that I could break down the door if I kept kicking it with my clunky army boots, so I moved over to my bed and kicked the frame. Stupid-ass bed. Stupid-ass room. Stupid-ass life.</P><P>I finger my lip ring, flipping it back and forth, contemplating the best way to fuck this relationship up.</P><P>Well duh! I'm such an idiot! All I have to do is be me. My dad is already close to kicking me out; if I just act my normal self, I'll scare Blondie away for sure.</P><P>"Miley! The Truscotts are here! Get out of your room and come welcome them!" My dad yelled at me.</P><P>"No!" I screamed back.</P><P>I heard our door open and close, and the stupid laughter of a middle-aged woman trying to move in on my dad. Or rather, <I>with. </I>Then I heard footsteps climbing up our stairs and getting dangerously close to my room. The doorknob starts to turn, but barely budges since I've locked it. Whoever it is knocks.</P><P>Well, it's definitely not my dad.</P><P>"Hello?" a stranger's voice calls. It's either Blondie or Hydrangea.</P><P>"Door's locked," I stated.</P><P>"I know. Could you unlock it? This is my room, according to Billy Ray's directions."</P><P>I stomp over and unlock the door, opening it just a crack to shove my head through.</P><P>Hibiscus is attractive, I'll give her that. She's got long, blonde hair past her shoulders, I'm assuming like her mom's, and big, blue eyes.</P><P>"First of all, his name is Mr. Stewart to you. Second of all, this is <I>my </I>room, not yours. I just have to pretend to let you live in here. So here's how it's gonna go, Daffodil. You drop your stuff here, make it look like you actually live here, but really, you don't. You sleep somewhere else. Where? That's not my issue. You can sleep in the backyard for all I care. Just stay out of my fucking room and out of my fucking life. Got it?"</P><P>She stares at me like I haven't uttered a word, then shoves past me and throws her bags onto my hardwood floor. "You're cute." <I>Cute? </I>She thinks I'm fucking <I>cute? </I>"So this is our room? Nice. I call the side of the bed closest to the door, 'cause I like to get up in the middle of the night and get a snack."</P><P>"Maybe you didn't hear me correctly-"</P><P>"No, I heard you right. I'm just ignoring you." She continued to look around the room, touching all of <I>my </I>stuff and getting her stupid ass fingerprints all over everything.</P><P>I was stunned. No one's ever out-right ignored me like that before. Bitch.</P><P>"No boyfriend?" she asked suddenly, whirling around to face me.</P><P>"Why would you say that? Are you trying to imply something?"</P><P>"You don't have pictures all over the place of you and some pathetic guy smushed against your cheek."</P><P>"No, I don't have a boyfriend."</P><P>"Hmm." <I>Hmm? </I>What's that supposed to mean? What's she trying to say? She hasn't even been in here 5 minutes and already I want her gone.</P><P>I was about to say something to her about how she should mind her own fucking business when my dad poked his head in with Blondie at his side. "How's everything going? You two girls getting along okay?"</P><P>"Actually-"</P><P>"Absolutely." That bitch cut me off. "I can tell Riley and I are gonna be best friends," Daisy says, throwing an arm hastily around my shoulder and plastering on a smile.</P><P>"My name's Miley," I say sharply, plucking her arm off of me.</P><P>"Good. I'm glad you two are getting along, sweetie. Come help get everything else out of the car." Blondie gestures with her hand to have Sunflower follow her, and then turns her smile on me. "It's nice to meet you, Miley."</P><P>"Wish I could say the same," I mumble under my breath, turning my back to her and walking over to my desk.</P><P>I hear them all walk away, and get up from the desk to shut my door closed again.</P><P>I hate them all.</P><P><B>okay, i know it's very short, but it's only kind of a teaser/trial to see if this story is worth continuing. what do y'all think?</B></P>
