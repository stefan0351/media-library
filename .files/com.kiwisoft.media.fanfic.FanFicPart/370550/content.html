<p>Thank you for all that reviewed and wants me to continue. Sorry for the wait. Had to write a term paper. Bleh. It's harder to change this into a Liley than I thought, takes patience (which I solemnly have) but I ain't givin up! Yes, well, Enjoy!</p>
<p>"What makes you think she'll even be here?" Miley asked as she sipped from her drink.</p>
<p>"Because this is where we met," Joannie said. "And because I know she comes here often. Who in their right mind wouldn't come on Valentine's Day?"</p>
<p>"Well, I could think of a few," Miley said dryly. "Do I need to tell you now that I hate country music?"</p>
<p>Joannie stared at her. "You can dance, right?"</p>
<p>"I can tango."</p>
<p>"Tango? No, two-step," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"Two-step? How about Jitterbug?"</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ! Who can't two-step?" Holding her hands palm up.</p>
<p>"I hate country music," Miley said again.</p>
<p>"A fine date you turned out to be. Well, you'll have to try. We <i>have </i>to be seen dancing together, and close." Joannie whispered into Miley's ear.</p>
<p>"Don't push it, Joannie. You're lucky I'm even here," Miley warned.</p>
<p>Leaning back, "I'm sure they'll play some fast stuff. Can you do that?"</p>
<p>"No. I have no rhythm. I'm an accountant, remember?" She reminded dryly.</p>
<p>"You look like a fucking model. How can you not have rhythm?"</p>
<p>"I can tango," Miley said again.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me this before you agreed to be my date?" Joannie demanded.</p>
<p>"<i>Agreed?</i> I think you got me drunk on one of your wine sauces. I don't remember actually agreeing to dancing," Miley said.</p>
<p>"Never mind. We can fake it. Slow songs. No one will know. We'll hang all over each other."</p>
<p>"If you kiss me, I'll never forgive you," Miley threatened. "You're like my sister. I think I'd throw up."</p>
<p>"Thanks a lot." She deadpanned.</p>
<p>"I told you we got here too late. There are no tables left," Mikayla said as they moved through the crowd.</p>
<p>"You get more dances if you're standing," Lilly said. "They think you're available."</p>
<p>"We <i>are</i> available." Mikayla reminded.</p>
<p>"And why is that?" Lilly asked. "I mean, we're cute enough. Why is that?"</p>
<p>"Because we're too picky, that's why. And we're not getting any younger."</p>
<p>"We're barely thirty," Lilly exasperated. "We have good jobs. We're damn good catches. Why are we single?"</p>
<p>"Because we're not skanky enough, that's why." Mikayla said resting her chin on her hand. "You see all these girls out there? All skanks. Not a care in the world because they don't care if people view them as hoes, hookers, or sluts. Why, because that's exactly what they are. They only care if they're getting' some tonight. That's why they're here on Valentine's."</p>
<p>Lilly stared, "Isn't that why you're here? To get with someone? So that makes you a skanky hoe."</p>
<p>"Exactly." She stated proudly.</p>
<p>"Why are we having this conversation?"</p>
<p>"Because we're pathetic," The dark haired girl said. "We're out at a bar on Valentine's Day, for God's sake."</p>
<p>"That doesn't make us pathetic."</p>
<p>"We're looking for a date at a bar, total strangers."</p>
<p>"I'm <i>not</i> looking for a date. I refuse to date someone I met at a bar." Lilly huffed.</p>
<p>"Where else are you going to meet someone?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, work maybe? Or through mutual friends. The usual places," she explained.</p>
<p>"And it's worked so well in the past," Mikayla said dryly.</p>
<p>"What about that woman you were seeing? Jackie?"</p>
<p>"Joannie. And I met her here."</p>
<p>"Well, there you go. It didn't last." Lilly said turning her nose up with intent.</p>
<p>"It didn't last because . . . well, because she was getting too serious," Mikayla sighed. "And <i>nobody </i>gets serious with me."</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Lilly questioned.</p>
<p>"I got scared," Mikayla admitted timidly.</p>
<p>"Scared?"</p>
<p>"I'm not ready to settle down. Hell, I'm thirty-one. Once you get a steady girlfriend, that's it, you're off the market. Then the next thing you know, you're forty."</p>
<p>"And? What if she was the one?"</p>
<p>"What if she wasn't?" Mikayla retorted.</p>
<p>"Mikayla, you usually know right off if they're not the one or not. For me, it's the first date. I guess that's why I seldom have a second." Lilly sighed.</p>
<p>"When are you going to ask me to dance?" Joannie said annoyed.</p>
<p>"I'm not." Miley deadpanned.</p>
<p>"We could at least practice," Joannie pushed.</p>
<p>Miley stood up with a sigh. "Fine. Let's practice. Don't yell if I step on your toes."</p>
<p>"You have to lead," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"Lead?" The taller girl's eyes widened.</p>
<p>"You're taller." Joannie explained.</p>
<p>"So?" she shrugged.</p>
<p>"It looks funny if the shorter one leads."</p>
<p>"I can't dance," Miley reminded. "Do you want to totally embarrass us?"</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll lead, but pretend you're doing it." They walked out to the dance floor. "And pretend that you like me."</p>
<p>"I do like you."</p>
<p>"You know what I mean." Joannie frowned.</p>
<p>"I refuse to kiss you."</p>
<p>"You're being difficult." Joannie whispered.</p>
<p>"I may not speak to you after this is all over with."</p>
<p>"She's not even here yet. You don't have to kiss me."</p>
<p>"Like I would."</p>
<p>They moved together, first Joannie taking Miley's right hand, them dropping it and taking her left, then dropping it again and picking up her right hand. They both stifled laughs as they attempted to move in unison.</p>
<p>"We look like idiots," Joannie whispered.</p>
<p>"We <i>are</i> idiots," Miley said as she stepped on Joannie's foot.</p>
<p>"My God, can't you move?"</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> moving." Miley said between her teeth.</p>
<p>"Follow me," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"How can I follow you when you're pushing me?"</p>
<p>"You're supposed to be leading. Now, spin me around," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"Are you out of your mind?"</p>
<p>"How hard can it be?" she asked, then attempted a spin. They very nearly ended up on the floor and they both started giggling.</p>
<p>"This is not working," Miley said as another couple bumped into them.</p>
<p>"No shit! You have two left feet."</p>
<p>"I can tango," Miley offered.</p>
<p>Joannie started laughing and Miley joined in.</p>
<p>"Okay. Let's wait for a really slow song. That way, we can just stand together and move and no one will know that you don't know how to dance," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous. You know that, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Sit down and shut up. I'm going for more drinks."</p>
<p>Miley sat as she was told, resting her elbows on the table again. She scanned the crowd, wondering what this Mikayla person looked like. She better be a knock-out, for all the trouble Joannie was putting her through. She watched the women milling about, jostling for standing positions in the crowded bar.</p>
<p>Her eyes stopped moving when they landed on a gorgeous blonde standing next to a dark haired woman. Her hair was tasseled, looking like it hadn't seen a brush all day. Then the blonde raked her fingers through it. Miley nodded. No brush. Fingers. She was dressed conservatively. Slacks and sweater. She looked out of place, especially next to the other woman, who was wearing jeans and boots. Miley watched as the blonde lightly touched the woman's arm and moved closer to speak to her. No, no, Miley thought. She was all wrong for this woman. They didn't go together at all.</p>
<p>Then the blonde turned towards her, as if sensing her watching. Across the room, their eyes met. Miley felt her heart catch and she swallowed. A slight smile touched the blonde's lips before she looked away.</p>
<p>"Oh my God," Miley whispered. <i>It's her. </i></p>
<p>"Here you go, sweetheart," Joannie said as she set two drinks on the table.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Miley murmured but her eyes never left the blonde.</p>
<p>"It's crowded as hell in here tonight," Joannie said. "Lots of people . . . looking for love," she sang.</p>
<p>"In all the wrong places," Miley supplied, then laughed. The song was a standing joke between them.</p>
<p>"Come on. This song is slow enough. I want to check out the other side. Maybe she's over there."</p>
<p>Miley hesitated. She would look like an ass out there, but at least she could get a better look at the blonde.</p>
<p>"Okay. But no spinning," Miley said.</p>
<p>They shuffled along with the other dancers, getting bumped from behind often. Miley didn't care. Her eyes were searching, trying to find her again.</p>
<p>There, still standing next to the woman. As they passed by them, she saw that the woman's eyes were blue. They were locked on her own. She stumbled. Joannie stepped on her foot and she nearly fell. When she looked back at the blonde, she was covering the smile on her face with one hand and Miley felt a blush creep up her face. Then blue eyes locked on hers again and she found she couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you?" Joannie demanded.</p>
<p>"It's her," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>"Her, who? You don't even know what she looks like."</p>
<p>"No. <i>Her</i>," Miley said again. "The <i>one</i>. Love at first sight," Miley whispered.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"There," Miley said, turning Joannie slightly.</p>
<p>"Oh my God," Joannie hissed. "No!" she said.</p>
<p>"Yes! She's the one. Our eyes met. I nearly collapsed."</p>
<p>"You can't have her," Joannie said.</p>
<p>"I can try. Oh, sure, she's with someone, but big deal."</p>
<p>"How could you do this to me?"</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"The woman. She's mine."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Mikayla."</p>
<p>"Mikayla? <i>That's</i> Mikayla?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Isn't she beautiful?"</p>
<p>Miley's heart sunk. Yes, the woman was beautiful. But she didn't look at all like Joannie's type. And she certainly didn't look like a Mikayla. No, that couldn't be Mikayla. Damn, how unfair was that? One look and Cupid's arrow went straight to her heart. Apparently, it had misfired.</p>
<p>Miley turned her back to the blonde, away from temptation, watching Joannie's face as she still stared. No, it certainly wasn't fair.</p>
<p>"So that's Mikayla?" she asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes. And who in the world is she with? They don't go together at all," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. They are all wrong for each other." And you're wrong for her, too, Miley thought.</p>
<p>They stumbled through the rest of the dance, finally ending up back at their table. Miley reached for her drink and swallowed it down in one gulp. Mikayla. The name wasn't right, either. Nothing was right. She closed her eyes, still seeing the blue ones locked onto her own.</p>
<p>"Wonder who she's with?" Joannie said. "But Mikayla is beautiful, right? I told you so."</p>
<p>"Certainly."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. But you can't have her," Joannie said again.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. She's yours."</p>
