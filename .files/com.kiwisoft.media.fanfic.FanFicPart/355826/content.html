<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ Talk About A Real Cat... -->

<p>My evening with Mel was, to say the very least, less than extraordinary.</p>

		<p>We went to dinner at Le Cigare Violant. I'd had the table for weeks, so it was at an especially lovely location. Private, intimate.</p>

		<p>"So, darling, how did your day go? You must be tired after all those surgeries."</p>

		<p>She glared at me. Yes, I suppose so. Then, she caught herself, smiled, and batted her eyes in that way she does when she wants to look innocent but knows she's far from it. "Niles, darling, how did you occupy yourself last night while I was with dear Loren Washington for her weekly night appointment?"</p>

		<p>I blinked and tried to keep my voice passive. "I read."</p>

		<p>She smiled tightly. "Oh, really? What did you read?"</p>

		<p>"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."</p>

		<p>That strange smile again. "Oh! That's a silly little play, isn't it? But everything like that paints life out to be so much more complicated than it really is." What? "Niles, I called your office this afternoon. Your secretary told me you rearranged all your afternoon appointments. Why?"</p>

		<p>It took me a moment. "Oh, you know I do that once in a while, Mel, when I want some time to relax."</p>

		<p>She smiled that sickeningly sweet smile again. "Oh? So what did you end up doing, darling?"</p>

		<p>"Well," I paused. "I spent a bit of time with Frasier. I talked to Daphne about her wedding plans." Both truths. "I talked to Dad for a while." Another truth.</p>

		<p>She forced a quick smile. She was angry about something, and she was having a harder and harder time hiding it. "And what did --" She paused with a tight smirk. "DAPHne have to say?" As she said her name, she speared a piece of lettuce with her fork so hard that I thought I could hear it crying. Oh, God.</p>

		<p>I swallowed. "Err-- well. We talked about Donny, mostly. We talked when... when she and Donny are planning on trying to have children." I gulped. "Donny wants to go ahead, you know, and Daphne wants to wait a bit." Half truths and omissions abound tonight.</p>

		<p>"Oh, is that right? And where did you have this little chat?"</p>

		<p>Oh, God. Someone saw us. "Um. Well, darling, we were walking Eddie --"</p>

		<p>Mel let out a sigh and relaxed a bit. "Oh, I'm sorry, darling. I don't know why I'm worried and jumpy. As if you would cheat on me, especially with the help." I sucked in a deep breath, bristling, but she didn't notice. "It's not really that I was worried, Niles, about that. Don't worry. I trust you. It's more that --" She paused. "How do I put this delicately? Well, Niles, one of my clients saw you in the park with Daphne today. It's not that I mind you spending time with her, you know, at Frasier's apartment, but it's a bit embarrassing to me when my friends and patients see my boyfriend fraternizing with his father's help. You understand, don't you, Niles?"</p>

		<p>I just stared at her. For a good minute. She didn't seem to notice, simply continued to dig into her salad with renewed vigor. Suddenly, my phone was ringing. I stood up. "If you'll excuse me, Mel, it seems as though I have a call."</p>
