<p>Disclaimer: Insert stupid/lame disclaimer joke here.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Viola glanced uneasily at her lab partner to the poor innocent animal they were supposed to be dissecting, her posture stiffly indicating that she didn't know what to do with herself. Olivia, sitting across the lab table from her, was very engrossed in mercilessly hacking away at the body with a wild look in her eye.</p>
<p>By heavily focusing on the disgusting innards splattering everywhere due to her maniacal slashing, Olivia was able to take her mind off recent events and the causes of her sleepless nights and inner tortures. She then proceeded to vent out her frustrations on the dead, unprotected body. Viola thought she was going to be sick.</p>
<p>The other students in the class glanced nervously at the blond in concern since she seemed to have lost her mind. The rumors were that the sudden break-up between Sebastian and Olivia had left the blond distraught and paranoid. Others students have reported sightings of seeing the blond running around the school grounds at early hours of the morning at top speed while screaming her head off. Some have even spotted her jumping on pogo sticks and sitting on washing machines, which are sure signs of after-break-up distress.</p>
<p>Girls felt sympathy for her, while the guys were planning on pouncing in these moments of vulnerability. But for some reason every time a guy would try to hit on Olivia they would be faced with a pissed Sebastian and most of them have been scared away because of it. But no matter, the fact was that the whole student body could feel the awkwardness and tension between Olivia and Sebastian.</p>
<p>And there was plenty awkwardness and tension, just not the kind that the other teens were thinking.</p>
<p>Viola gulped and leaned in slightly towards her lab partner uncertainly. "Hey Olivia? You mind taking it easy with the project? Its his first time, after all." Viola joked, cracking a small smile to relieve some of the tension. She suspected Olivia was still angry at her about the whole 'barging into her shower, possibly injuring her and indirectly molesting her naked body' situation. It was obvious to her by the way Olivia was currently holding the knife and looking at her. Viola unconsciously leaned away.</p>
<p><i>God, I hope she isn't pretending that's me</i>... Viola cringed at the thought. Just then Malcolm walked up to them with flyers in his hands.</p>
<p>"Hey Olivia, I don't mean to worry you but Malvolio has gone missing, and-" Malcolm was cut off when Olivia grabbed the flyer he was handing out to her and ripped it in half. Malcolm looked like he was about to cry as he helplessly watched the remaining two sheets flutter to the ground. "Don't feed him..." he finished lamely, voice quivering.</p>
<p>"Yeah, 'cause my very first instinct, to feed the tarantula. Give me a goddamn break!" Olivia said in a dangerous tone while giving her stalker a full dose of the evil eye. It was made more pronounce by the bags under her eyes resulted from her sleepless nights. "Get lost, Malcolm."</p>
<p>Malcolm ran away bawling his eyes out. Olivia went back to taking her sexual frustrations out on the poor small figure prostrated before her. Viola had to hold in her rising bile as some kind of unknown body fluid splashed near her hand. If she didn't change the subject now she was going to pass out! She glanced around her surroundings desperately until her gaze met with Duke Orsino's pleading eyes.</p>
<p>"Hey, heres a wild idea," Viola said hastily to take the blond's attentions off her outlet. "What do you think of going out with Duke Orsino?"</p>
<p>Olivia looked incredulously at her. "Duke?" At his name, Duke looked over at Olivia to give her a bashful smile. "Why would you ask me that?" Olivia said in an annoyed tone.</p>
<p>"No reason, its just that he wants to steal your endangered purity from me."</p>
<p>"My what?"</p>
<p>"He likes you. A lot, actually. And hes really not such a bad guy so I was just wondering if you might want to give him a shot?" Viola asked in a friendly manner. She felt like she owed her roommate after he took Sebastian under his wing. Olivia was still getting over the whole 'endangered purity' comment.</p>
<p>"No. Absolutely not."</p>
<p>"Come on!"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Yeah!"</p>
<p>"NO!" Olivia's voice came out hostile and she saw a flash of hurt in Viola's eyes. The blond took a breath to calm herself. She knew Viola was just playing around with her and she didn't want to hurt Viola's feelings in any way, shape, or form. No matter what kind of physical torment she was putting her through.</p>
<p>"Look, hes good looking and everything but... he's just not the one for me." Olivia said quietly while looking meaningfully into Viola's eyes. Viola got the impression that her blond friend was looking at her with an expression that screamed 'Kiss me, you hunk of human, you!', and she went slightly red at the thought.</p>
<p>"Okay, I was just throwing out a suggestion. But if you don't want to I'm not forcing you." Viola said in a neutral tone. Olivia glanced at Duke and then back at Viola's boy-clad face.</p>
<p><i>Is it possible? That maybe Viola likes Duke?</i> thought the blond. The idea brought her some alarm and she felt instant jealousy towards the soccer captain. They had been spending a lot of time together recently, and now she worried that Viola had developed feelings for the obviously hunky guy. Just another problem Olivia had deal with and she groaned internally at her luck. She had to intervene before it got too far! She could only be thankful that Duke wasn't aware that Sebastian was actually a girl or else that would be a more serious problem... Unless he was secretly gay.</p>
<p>"Hes probably just another dumb jock trying to hook up with me so he could tell all his friends but-"</p>
<p>"But too insecure to treat you as an equal." Viola finished for her. Olivia was taken aback by the understanding in Viola's eyes and tone.</p>
<p>"Exactly." Olivia said in pleasant surprise. Viola could be oblivious sometimes but she had her moments that made you think twice about her. Olivia mentally recalled what Viola had previously told her about her ex-boyfriend and put two and two together.</p>
<p>"Tell me about it." Viola said with a mournful sigh. She looked so cute at that moment Olivia couldn't help but think 'Why don't you try anything with me, damn you!'</p>
<p>"Listen, Liv," Viola started saying, snapping Olivia out of her frustrated thought process. "About what happened in the shower yesterday.." Viola lowered her voice, not wanting any of her fellow classmates to listen in on this conversation. "I'm so sorry!"</p>
<p>"I kind of got that already." Olivia said with a playful smile, making Viola blush a bit.</p>
<p>"I know but.. Look, I just don't want you to be mad at me or anything. I mean, we're friends and I don't want to lose you."</p>
<p>"Why would you think I was mad?" Olivia was surprised at this and Viola furrowed her brow in confusion.</p>
<p>"Gee, I don't know why.." Viola unconsciously looked down at the brutally diced subject in front of them before quickly glancing away, looking a bit green in the face. Olivia, who noticed the reaction, sheepishly put the scalpel down and waited for Viola to continue. "The point is that you're one of the only people I feel most comfortable around... and I don't want to lose that because of some dumb mistake that I made." Viola finished sincerely.</p>
<p>"I feel the same way about you." Olivia responded quietly. She couldn't help but swoon on her feet slightly at Viola's words. It was amazing how Viola was able to diffuse the tension in their situation, and Olivia felt completely at ease for the moment. At least until she closed her eyes at night and her cursed imagination struck again.</p>
<p>"Good." Viola said with a relieved smile. She was happy to see her friend with that smile back on her face which Viola found absolutely charming. She looked back at the small animal they were supposed to be studying with some reluctance. "So whats that supposed to be?" she asked as she poked... something. Olivia looked away from Viola's face to see what she was indicating.</p>
<p>"Oh, I think that's the spleen." Olivia answered, not quite sure after the mess she had created. Viola hummed in interest before her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she passed out on the classroom floor.</p>
<p>"Sebastian!"</p>
