<p>ZombieeSlayaa: The Principal wanted to see me to check that I'm fitting in.</p>
<p>Skatergirl: Oh ok. Cool.</p>
<p>Skatergirl: Well you missed Miley falling off her chair and creating a domino effect. It was sooo cool. You shoulda been there.</p>
<p>ZombieeSlayaa: Yeah. It sounds great. Too bad I missed it.</p>
<p>Skatergirl: So why are you on your computer everyday after school?</p>
<p>ZombieeSlayaa: Because my friends are always online and besides, it's better than being bombarded everywhere I go.</p>
<p>Skatergirl: Well what if they bombarded you here?</p>

<p>ZombieeSlayaa: Why do you ask?</p>
<p>Skatergirl: No Reason.</p>
<p>Skatergirl: I've just seen the way you look at her.</p>
<p>ZombieeSlayaa: Well I've seen the way you look at her.</p>

<p>ZombieeSlayaa: Why not? Isn't it worth the chance…what if you saw a sign that she likes you back?</p>
