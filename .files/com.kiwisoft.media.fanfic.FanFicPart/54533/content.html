<!-- Telling Series \ Section 1: Mom - X-Rated Twister -->

<p>When they reached the top of the stairs they encountered a
small problem. They looked from Brooke's bedroom doorway to Sam's and then at
each other in silent question. After a moments thought, Brooke pulled Sam
towards Sam's own room after which she closed and locked the door. </p>
<p>"My room, Princess?" Sam asked, her voice low as she played
with Brooke's hair. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"I told you I thought a lot about this. Your room is on the
opposite end of the house," she whispered back captivated by the way Sam was
running her hands through her hair. She turned slightly and put her hands on
Sam's hips. She looked into Sam's eyes, which looked slightly frightened.
"What's wrong?" Sam bit her lip. </p>
<p>"Ah, what if?what if they hear us?" she asked just above a
whisper while blushing fiercely. Brooke had never seen anyone turn that
dangerous a shade of red. She was almost afraid Sam's ears were going to burn.
"Not that I plan on screaming but you never know?" Sam trailed off and the blush
deepened. </p>
<p>"Geez, Sam, stop blushing before you stroke out on me," Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>Sam smiled and tried to hide her face with her hand in embarrassment. "It's a
valid concern," she pointed out quietly. </p>
<p>Brooke nodded. "Yes it is," she agreed. "Hang on a sec, I've got an idea."
Brooke left Sam and went into her own room. A few seconds later, Sam could hear
the radio blasting. Brooke returned to Sam's room, shutting both bathroom doors
as she did. </p>
<p>"There, now all they'll hear is the stereo," Brooke declared
happily. "Now where were we?" Sam smiled and pulled Brooke to her for a heated
kiss. The kiss intensified and soon hands began to explore. Sam reached up and
unbuttoned Brooke's blouse. She pushed the material off of Brooke's shoulders
and it slid unnoticed to the floor. Sam took a step back and looked at Brooke
standing there in her pants and light pink lacy bra. Brooke watched as Sam
reached out and traced the outline of the edge of the bra covering her left
breast almost in a state of awe. Her touch was featherlight but Brooke could
still feel the heat from Sam's hand. </p>
<p>"Sam?" she asked wondering if maybe they were going too fast
for Sam and Sam wasn't ready. Sam tore her eyes from Brooke's chest and fixed
them on Brooke's eyes. The look there stole Brooke's breath away. It was pure,
boundless love. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam answered her voice gravelly. Not waiting for
Brooke to answer, Sam took a step closer to nuzzle Brooke's neck and reached
around to undo the bra. She slipped the straps off Brooke's shoulders and it
followed the blouse to the floor. Brooke was slightly self-conscious as Sam
again took a step back to observe the vision in front of her. She looked to see
unshed tears in Sam's eyes. Before she could ask, Sam placed a finger over her
lips to silence her. </p>
<p>"Perfect," Sam whispered. "You are utterly and beautifully
perfect," she said in awe. Tears splashed down Brooke's face at Sam's words. </p>
<p>"Sam," she half-complained in obvious embarrassment. Sam shook
her head. </p>
<p>"You are," Sam insisted quietly in a tone that allowed for no
argument. She reached out and spread her hands across Brooke's chest, barely
touching and ran her fingers over the silky skin. She went down Brooke's sides,
across her abdomen and up again, stopping at Brooke's breasts. Brooke watched
her, slightly confused until Sam cupped a breast in each hand gently, as if
testing their weight. When Sam brushed across her nipples with her thumbs,
Brooke couldn't help the gasp that escaped her. She looked to see Sam watching
her with a worried look on her face. She reached out and stroked Sam's face. </p>
<p>"It's OK, Sam," she purred. Sam smiled and repeated the
action, this time adding a pinch to the already erect nub and Brooke pulled her
into a fierce kiss. They backed up until they hit the bed and then promptly fell
onto it with Sam on top. Sam giggled. Brooke had to ask. </p>
<p>"What's so funny?" Sam giggled again. </p>
<p>"Left hand green," Sam said, referring to the `X-rated version
of Twister' comment from earlier. Brooke rolled her eyes but giggled also. </p>
<p>"Incorrigible," Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Beautiful," Sam whispered as she leaned over for a kiss,
letting her hair fall around them like a curtain. Brooke tried to lift the hem
of Sam's shirt up but for some reason Sam stopped her. There was a pleading look
in Sam's eyes that Brooke didn't understand. She'd all ready seen Sam's breasts
once, why was Sam so shy all of a sudden? </p>
<p>"Not yet, OK?" Sam whispered. Brooke nodded although she was
confused. Sam kissed her way around Brooke's throat, pausing at the pulse point
and savoring the way the beating underneath was rapid and the way Brooke's
breathing was sometimes only shallow gasps. Her hands had never actually left
Brooke's breasts and she was eager to see what they tasted like. She kissed her
way along Brooke's collarbone tasting the tang of salt from the slight sheen of
sweat they were both developing. She ran her tongue down Brooke's right breast
until she reached the nipple, which she sucked into her mouth. </p>
<p>"Saaaam," Brooke moaned lowly. She felt Sam smile. Sam swirled
her tongue around the erect nipple in her mouth while continuing to suck and
Brooke was slowly going insane. She tugged at Sam's shirt again. </p>
<p>"Please Sam, I need to feel your skin," she said, not caring
if she sounded like she was begging. Sam bit down slightly and Brooke decided
that maybe she could wait a little longer for Sam to take her shirt off. Sam
repeated the process on Brooke's other breast and moved her hands lower, dipping
her fingers just below the waistband of Brooke's pants. Brooke sat up so fast
she almost knocked Sam off the bed. </p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke panted, wanting nothing more than for Sam to
continue but wanting them to be on equal footing, as it were. She put her hands
on either side of Sam's shirt. "Please." Reluctantly, Sam nodded. Brooke pulled
the shirt up over Sam's head and tossed it to the floor. Sam immediately wrapped
her arms around herself in a protective gesture. Brooke reguarded her in her
plain white bra questioningly. </p>
<p>"What's wrong?" </p>
<p>Sam shook her head. "Nothing, I?" Sam stopped and frowned. </p>
<p>"I've all ready seen the goods, Sam," Brooke said with a
smile, hoping to ease Sam's sudden discomfort. Again Sam shook her head.
</p>
<p>"It's not that," Sam said softly. "I just?" she stopped again
and Brooke reached out to unwrap Sam's arms. Her arms came away surprisingly
easy and Brooke saw what Sam was uncomfortable about. The crisscross network of
scars that marked her chest and abdomen and served as a reminder of Prom night. </p>
<p>"Oh, Sammy," Brooke said in understanding. A few tears fell
down Sam's cheeks. </p>
<p>"Do you think I'm ugly?" Sam whispered in fear as she looked
away. Brooke cupped Sam's chin in her hand and brought her face back to meet her
own. </p>
<p>"Never," she said honestly. Sam's face lit up. "You're
beautiful and I love you. A few scars don't mean jack." </p>
<p>"But you're flawless," Sam countered quietly. "Not a blemish
to be found and meanwhile I look like Frankenstein's monster's pet." Brooke
sighed. She ran her fingers over the scars making Sam shiver slightly.
</p>
<p>"You're not ugly and you're not a monster," she explained
patiently. She leaned down to kiss a few of the scars, making Sam shiver harder.
Brooke reached around and undid the clasp on Sam's bra and it followed its
predecessor on the floor. They both sat there staring at each other topless for
a few minutes. </p>
<p>"I've never done this before," Sam admitted quietly, blushing
again. Brooke tilted her head slightly. </p>
<p>"What about George?" Sam's blush deepened as she shook her
head. </p>
<p>"He was a nice guy and all but, he wasn't `the one'," she looked up into
Brooke's eyes. "You are." </p>
<p>Brooke smiled. "If it makes you feel any better, technically, I've never done
THIS before either," she said with a small laugh. Sam stretched out her hand and
brushed away a lock of blonde hair that had fallen into Brooke's eyes. Brooke
grasped her hand. </p>
<p>"We find out together, huh?" Sam asked. Brooke nodded as she
lay back on the bed bringing Sam with her. She ran her hands over Sam's warm
skin hardly believing that this was really happening, that Sam was really here
with her and loved her as much as she loved her back. She never would have
thought it possible and yet, as she ran her hands over the expanse of Sam's back
and felt Sam's hands on her own body, Brooke knew this was no dream. </p>
<p>Again, Sam's hands found their way to the waistband of
Brooke's pants where she paused slightly. She really had no idea what she was
doing. She really didn't want this to be another bad sexual experience for
Brooke. She really, truly and deeply loved the girl and wanted this to be
special. Sam was no prude. Everytime she dreamed of making love to Brooke (which
was fairly often) she always seemed to instinctively know what to do and she had
seen the movie Bound. Several times. But still, she was afraid of being a bad
lover. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke's gentle voice brought Sam out of her internal
worry. "We don't have to if you're not ready." Sam looked up into the loving
face of the person she cared most for in the world and her anxiety disappeared. </p>
<p>"I'm ready, I just want this to be special, Princess. You've
had some bad experiences and I want to do this right," she explained. Brooke
smiled in understanding. </p>
<p>"It will be special because it's you," Brooke whispered. Sam returned the
smile and slowly unzipped Brooke's jeans and slid them down the slender legs.
Brooke helped her slide them off and they joined the growing pile of clothes on
the floor, as did Sam's jeans a few seconds later. </p>
<p>Sam stared at the pink panties that matched the bra she removed from Brooke
earlier. She arched an eyebrow. "Matching set? How cute," she joked, as she
moved her body up to lie beside Brooke.</p>
<p>Brooke looked at Sam's underwear and mimicked the eyebrow. "Leopard print?"
she asked. </p>
<p>Sam blushed. "I was feeling frisky this morning," she explained shyly.</p>
<p>Brooke's eyes widened. "Oh really? Me-ow," Brooke purred as she draped her body over
Sam's. Kisses and hands grew more insistant and again Brooke found her role
reversed with Sam on top. Sam said nothing but grinned wickedly and straddled
Brooke's waist for a second before moving down, kissing and licking any skin
between herself and her ultimate goal. When she reached the waistband of
Brooke's panties, she dipped a finger beneath it to gauge Brooke's reaction.
Brooke sucked in a breath and rose off the bed slightly to meet her hand. </p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke complained when Sam removed her hand. Sam smiled
and proceeded to remove both Brooke's underwear and her own. She kissed her way
up from Brooke's ankles to her knees, up past her thighs, placing gentle, tender
kisses on the inside of Brooke's upper thighs making her whimper slightly before
moving up to her abdomen. The scent of Brooke's arousal made Sam dizzy and made
her own arousal almost painful in its intensity. </p>
<p>"Please, Sammy," Brooke begged softly, feeling as if Sam were
driving her insane. Sam looked up into the half-lidded eyes of her love. She
moved to take one of Brooke's nipples in her mouth and slid one finger into
Brooke's warmth. Brooke moaned at the double attack and clutched desperately at
the sheets as Sam slowly started to move her finger inside of her. </p>
<p>"God, Saaaam," Brooke gasped as she moved her body to meet
Sam's hand and Sam added another finger to the first. Brooke had never felt like
this before in her previous experiences, her nerve endings were on fire and she
was hyperaware of everything Sam was doing. She felt Sam's mouth leave her
breast and almost leapt off the bed in pure pleasure when she felt the first
flick of Sam's tongue on her clit. </p>
<p>"God, don't stop," she rasped as Sam continued to lick and
suck around her fingers as they pumped in and out in a steady rhythm. Brooke
felt the abyss approaching but tried to hold on. She wanted this to last. But
when Sam started to suck harder on her clit, the battle was lost. Brooke was
vaguely aware of shouting something but was unsure what it was as she came. </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Sam, for her part, was happy and content to stay where she was
for the rest of her life. The sounds Brooke was making and the way Brooke was
moving were telling her that she was doing everything right. And when she had
tasted Brooke, she knew that there was nothing that you could ever offer her
that she would ever give that up for. Sweet, tangy and uniquely Brooke. She just
couldn't get enough. And then she felt the stiffening of Brooke's body, the
contractions around her fingers and the soul-searing cry that came from Brooke's
throat. Although lost in a sexual haze, part of Sam's mind was really glad that
Brooke turned on the radio in her room. They'd have a lot of trouble explaining
why Brooke yelled: "OH GOD YES SAAAAAAAAM!" to Mike in the morning. </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Brooke opened her eyes slowly and looked directly into a pair
of chocolate brown ones. She smiled and they smiled back. </p>
<p>"You OK?" Sam asked as she brushed Brooke's sweat dampened
hair out of her face. </p>
<p>"You are amazing," Brooke gushed making Sam blush. </p>
<p>Sam let out a relieved breath. "I try," she joked. Brooke leaned over and captured Sam's lips
in a passionate kiss. She was vaguely aware of herself on Sam's lips. Brooke
shifted so that she was covering half of Sam's body with her own. She loved the
feel of bare skin on bare skin. </p>
<p>"My turn," Brooke growled. Sam's eyebrows went up but she said
nothing, surrendering to the cheerleader's affections. As it was her skin felt
like it was on fire and her blood was boiling. She was afraid that if Brooke
didn't do something soon she was going to burst into flames anyway. </p>
<p>Brooke kissed her way along Sam's jawline while her hands
wandered lower, caressing Sam's breasts and making Sam gasp slightly. She
kneaded the soft mounds with her hands, loving the way the pert nipples dug into
her palms. Sam moaned and moved her body underneath Brooke in desperate
pleasure. </p>
<p>"Brooke, please," Sam begged as Brooke kissed her way down
towards her breasts. Her whole body was humming and begging for release. Her
hands unconsciously clenched and unclenched the sheets as Brooke took one erect
nipple in her mouth and began to suck ardently. </p>
<p>"Oh God," Sam gasped as one hand buried itself in Brooke's
silky hair encouraging her. Brooke smiled and continued her mission, to drive
Sam insane. She used her thumb and forefinger to pinch the other nipple even
tighter before switching places and repeating the process. Brooke continued this
until she felt Sam pressing down on her head and squirming beneath her.
</p>
<p>"Brooooke," she whimpered. Brooke could feel the heat coming
from Sam and knew the other girl couldn't wait much longer. She moved back up
Sam's body and placed a passionate kiss on Sam's lips as she placed her hand
palm down on Sam's abdomen. Sam's entire body arched off the bed towards her and
another whimper escaped her throat. </p>
<p>"Easy, Sam," Brooke whispered as she slid her hand down to
Sam's core and slowly slid one finger inside the wet folds and into Sam. Sam
sucked in a pained breath and Brooke looked at her in concern. Her eyes were
clenched tightly shut. </p>
<p>"Sam?" she asked quietly, remembering the pain associated with
what she was doing. Sam's body moved to meet her hand even as her eyes opened
and met Brooke's. The normally brown orbs were black with desire and filled with
pleasure. </p>
<p>"Don't?stop," Sam panted as her body kept moving. Brooke
smiled and nodded, beginning to rhythmically stroke Sam. Sam continued to speak
but no longer made any coherent noises and Brooke was glad she'd turned on the
radio in her room to drown her out even though she herself loved it. Being
careful not to hurt Sam, she slowly added another finger to the first and Sam
let out a low gutteral moan. </p>
<p>Unable to resist anymore, Brooke moved down to join her
fingers. Sam gasped as Brooke's tongue joined her fingers in their stroking and
she bit down on her lip to keep from crying out. Brooke had found her Heaven.
She wanted to taste and experience all of Sam and did so energetically. Sam
bucked and jerked on the bed until her breath hitched one last time and her body
stiffened for an instant before convulsions overtook her. And Brooke was there
for the whole thing, drawing it out as long as she could until Sam collapsed
back onto the bed spent. </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>"Oh God," Sam whispered when she was capable of coherent
speech again sometime later. Brooke smiled at her as she held Sam tightly
against her. </p>
<p>"No, only Brooke," she answered. Sam giggled softly and looked
at her wide-eyed. </p>
<p>"I had no idea," Sam told her. </p>
<p>"Neither did I," Brooke blushed.
</p>
<p>Sam frowned at her. "Huh? I don't understand."
</p>
<p>Brooke lovingly brushed some damp hair away from Sam's eyes. "I may have had
sex before, Sam, but it was never like that," Brooke explained. "And that wasn't
just sex, that was love."
</p>
<p>Sam smiled. "Oh," was all she said although she looked extremely happy.
She snuggled against Brooke. "I'm glad I waited for that `someone special'," Sam whispered
as she traced a pattern on Brooke's chest. "That was beautiful." Brooke captured
her lips for a gentle kiss.
</p>
<p>"Yes, it was, Sammy. You were right. Thank you," she said. </p>
<p>"You are more than welcome," Sam responded. She looked shyly
up at Brooke. "Uh, I don't suppose you have any energy left cuz I'm not
tired," she said wickedly. </p>
<p>Brooke laughed. "I was hoping you'd say that." </p>
