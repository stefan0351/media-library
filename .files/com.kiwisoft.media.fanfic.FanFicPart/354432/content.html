<!-- Empty Hate \ Part 3 (later that night) -->

<p>Brooke propped herself against the side of the car and opened her
mouth to accept the ministrations of her boyfriends tongue. As much
as she wanted to give in to him and let herself get carried away, she
couldn't. Every time she closed her eyes all she saw was Sam's crying
face, her beautiful dark eyes filled with tears. "Wait, beautiful?"
Brooke's eyebrows contracted in confusion.</p>

<p>"Ow," Josh yelped, "you bit my tongue!"</p>

<p>"Sorry," Brooke apologized, letting Josh continue on.
Who was she kidding? Anyone could see that Brooke's face, filled with
sorrow and regret and longing, was piercingly beautiful,
breathtaking. All she had wanted to do was just to hold her.</p>

<p>But wait, this was Sam, Sam her worst enemy, her EVIL soon-to-
be stepsister. Brooke desperately tried to believe this, but it rang
hollow in her ears, ands she knew she didn't believe it, didn't
believe it at all. All she could think of was Sam's sot tender lips,
curled in a clever smirk, and then Brooke covering them with her own.
And for a second, she was no longer with Josh, but it was Sam's
limber body that was pressed against hers, holding her close. And it
was her hand's that traveled the expanse of Brooke's body, Sam's
tender lips that nipped at her neck. And it was Sam that sent shivers
running all through her body.</p>

<p>In the back of her mind, an alarm was going off. It was telling her
that her heart was going to get broken, and that she would never be
able to hold Sam again like she wanted to right then. But it didn't
matter, because something inside her was broken, and she didn't know
how to fix it, or even if she wanted to.</p>
