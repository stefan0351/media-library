<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 21: Battles -->

<P>"What was that?" Naomi asked as she was tossed to the cargo bay floor.</P>
<P>"Phaser fire, a direct hit," Seven said as she moved over to the fallen
child. She helped her up and then checked her for injuries.</P>
<P>"Damn it," B’Elanna said. She paced the cargo bay, then went to a storage
locker and took out two compression riffles and went toward Seven. "Here, take
this." She held out the riffle.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow, but took the weapon in her left hand, the used her
right hand, the fully human hand, to hold Naomi against her. "Do you think the
Dengari will breach the Borg forcefield?"</P>
<P>"Can’t be too sure." B’Elanna smiled, but she wasn’t convinced. The sounds of
small arms fire could be heard in the distance. "Sounds like we’ve got a
boarding party out there." The Klingon saw Naomi’s eyes widen. "Hey, they won’t
get this far. These bio-dampening armbands mask our lifesigns, so there’s no
reason for them to even come in here. Besides, they can’t get past Seven’s Borg
forcefield."</P>
<P>"Is that true?" Naomi asked as she looked up at Seven.</P>
<P>"We won’t let anyone hurt you," Seven promised.</P>
<P>Naomi nodded, then turned toward the cargo bay doors when they heard the
sounds of phaser fire getting closer. </P>
<P>"Seven? Can I hold your hand?" Naomi asked.</P>
<P>"No," Seven said. She smiled down at the strawberry blonde child and knelt
beside her. "Holding my hand would be insufficient." Seven picked up Naomi,
settling her onto one hip while she held the compression riffle in the other
hand. "Is this acceptable?" Seven asked her with a smile as she straightened to
her full height.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Naomi said as she clung to the tall blonde. She smiled and put her
head on Seven’s shoulder.</P>
<P>B’Elanna watched, torn between the simple enjoyment of the scene in front of
her and the fear of the approaching danger. Seeing Seven hold Naomi was a like a
preview of what life held for her, and she suddenly wanted nothing more than to
get every last Dengari and throw them into the nearest waste receptacle.</P>
<P>"Seven, I want you and Naomi to get behind those containers. I’m gonna’ cover
the door." B’Elanna pushed two of the smaller containers together, forming a
small barricade. "You two stay out of sight, no matter what happens. If they get
to me, they may not even see you two back there."</P>
<P>Seven carried Naomi over to a huge container that created its own wall and
put her down. "Stay back here, okay?"</P>
<P>Naomi nodded.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres," Seven said as she turned around. Her voice was harsh, cold
enough to freeze lava, and hard enough to cut through it once it turned to
stone. "You will <I>not </I>put yourself in harm’s way. You promised me."</P>
<P>"Seven, we both agreed that we would avoid danger… when possible." B’Elanna
moved to her wife. "Be’nal," she whispered. "Please, you have to be safe," the
proud Klingon begged as she rested her hand on Seven’s belly.</P>
<P>"You do not fight fair," Seven said with tears in her eyes as she heard the
phaser fire now directly outside the cargo bay.</P>
<P>"Go back with Naomi." B’Elanna said quietly. "I’ll stay out of sight as long
as possible. Maybe they won’t even come in here."</P>
<P>"Be safe." Seven raised B’Elanna’s face and then kissed her. It was a soft,
brief kiss, to remind both women of what they were fighting to keep safe.</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded.</P>
<P>"Naomi Wildman," Seven said formally as she went toward the child. "Do you
know how to operate a phaser?"</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna yelled as she ran to her wife. "She’s a child."</P>
<P>"Klingon children her age have already competed in bat’tleth competitions,"
the exdrone reasoned.</P>
<P>"A bat’tleth isn’t a compression riffle," B’Elanna countered.</P>
<P>"I can use a phaser," Naomi said quietly.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna turned.</P>
<P>"Not the compression riffles. Mom won’t let me touch them, but I can use a
hand phaser. Tom taught me how to play Velocity," she explained. "He’s not very
good." The child rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>"This isn’t a game," B’Elanna said as she moved toward the half-Katarian.
</P>
<P>Seven went to the storage locker and retrieved a class one hand phaser and
set it for maximum stun.</P>
<P>"I know," Naomi said seriously. "But I can hit the target way better than
Tom…or Neelix."</P>
<P>"What the hell was Tom thinking? Doesn’t he know how dangerous Velocity is?"
B’Elanna asked, though she didn’t really expect an answer from the child.</P>
<P>Seven held the phaser away from Naomi. "Have you ever accidentally shot
yourself while playing Velocity?"</P>
<P>"No." Naomi rolled her eyes. "But Tom did," she volunteered.</P>
<P>Seven nodded toward the containers and led Naomi back behind them and out of
view. She put the phaser on a low box, so that Naomi could reach it.</P>
<P>"Do not take the phaser unless there is no other choice. Do you understand?"
Seven asked.</P>
<P>Naomi nodded.</P>
<P>Seven stood and nodded at the child, then listened intently to the sounds in
the corridor. </P>
<P>"They are accessing the cargo bay access panel. I can hear them," Seven said
as she turned to B’Elanna. "I will stay with Naomi. But remember, Be’nal, my
heart beats in rhythm with yours, so you must survive."</P>
<P>"All right," B’Elanna said. She knew it was the best offer she would get. She
kissed Seven’s cheek and jogged back to her hiding place closer to the cargo bay
door.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Captain Janeway held back as she waited for the invisible tactical team to
clear the corridor. She paused, holding her breath, then heard three short
bursts of phaser fire.</P>
<P>"Clear," Harry Kim yelled.</P>
<P>"Stay behind me." Janeway stood and moved stealthily along the wall toward
the sound of Harry’s voice. She reached four unconscious Dengari and looked
around, not knowing where Harry was.</P>
<P>Malok came up beside her, then stopped abruptly when he collided with one of
the invisible officers. "Sorry," the husky Dengari said to the air in front of
him.</P>
<P>"No problem," came Harry’s muffled reply.</P>
<P>"Okay," Janeway said as she looked at the chronometer on the nearby comm
panel. "It’s been almost five minutes since the Dengari beamed over." She tapped
her comm badge twice, then paused and tapped it twice more. It chirped after she
finished the last tap. "Janeway to Chakotay, report?"</P>
<P>*"Condition gamma blue,"* Chakotay’s said over the comm badge. The code let
Janeway know that they still had hostiles on board, but that the bridge was
secure and they could use the comm badges for vital communication. </P>
<P>She had instructed the First Officer to remain at condition gamma white until
she contacted him five minutes after any invasion. She hadn’t known for certain
what the Magistrate had in mind, but she had prepared a contingency plan for
almost any possibility.</P>
<P>"Command team alpha is continuing toward green sector," Janeway said. She
wasn’t about to broadcast her location without using code words for any Dengari
who were monitoring the comm channels.</P>
<P>*"Understood."* Chakotay’s voice was calm, and suggested that he had complete
trust in his captain, which he did. "Green sector is secure, captain, however
there are still seventeen remaining hostile on deck 6. We have a nasty fire
fight in blue sector," he added slowly. "We’re a little thin there." </P>
<P>The words hung in the air, Engineering had been designated green sector, the
most important area on board, but it was secure. Janeway had arranged for all
the crew in the vital area to wear bio-dampeners to hide the number of crew from
the invading force. She also sent six of thirteen precious isolation suits to
guard the critical systems. The news that blue sector, the area near cargo bay
two, was under heavy attack concerned her. She had opted to leave that area
unprotected by any isolation suited security officers. She had put her faith in
the Borg forcefield to keep Seven and B’Elanna out of Dengari hands. Apparently,
the Dengari had figured out enough to focus on that area.</P>
<P>"Understood," Janeway said. "Alpha command team is proceeding to blue
sector."</P>
<P>"Captain?" Malok asked as he dipped his head to her eye level.</P>
<P>She raised her eyebrows, signaling him to continue. Chakotay heard the
question over her comm badge and waited, listening intently.</P>
<P>"Can we access the shipwide communications systems?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Why?" she asked.</P>
<P>"Can I address my troops? Most of my men do not want this conflict, if I can
get any of them to step down, it will be worth the effort," he explained.</P>
<P>"All right," she said. "Chakotay, give me a shipwide channel."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna heard the doors to the cargo bay creak as they opened. She watched
as two Dengari poked their dark heads inside and scanned the room. She waited,
hoping they would choose another target when they didn’t register any
lifesigns.</P>
<P>"Nothing," the guard with the scanner said. He sighed, relieved.</P>
<P>"Pay attention, you fool," the second Dengari said. "Half of these people
haven’t even shown lifesigns. Look, a secondary forcefield. Why would they need
another forcefield if there is nothing here?" He pointed at the glowing green
shell that surrounded the back of the cargo bay.</P><I>
<P>*"Damn it,"*</I> B’Elanna thought. She should have realized the extra
protection would only serve to point out their presence.</P>
<P>"Come on," the second guard prompted as he shoved the other man forward. The
first guard scanned the room, thinking that perhaps something might appear on
his device.</P>
<P>"I’ve never seen an energy signature like this," he said as he scanned the
Borg forcefield. "I don’t think we can penetrate it. We’ll have to cut off the
energy source."</P>
<P>Three more Dengari came into the cargo bay; they looked over their shoulders
and then back to the first guard with questioning glances.</P>
<P>The first guard waved them into the room. "See if you can find the power
source for that forcefield," he ordered. </P><I>
<P>*"Double damn,"*</I> B’Elanna thought. <I>*"Couldn’t just have the two come
in here… No…that would have been too easy. I have to have half the damn boarding
party in here."*</I> She watched in silence as the newcomers worked quickly,
ripping open the appropriate panels and attacking the power conduits<I>. *"Well,
they seem to be decent engineers,"</I> * she thought as she calculated how long
it would take them to drop the forcefield. <I>*"Two minutes, tops,"*</I> she
decided. At that moment the forcefield flickered and disappeared. <I>*"Better
than I figured,"*</I> she realized. She hoped they were not as good at combat as
they were at engineering but figured that was too much to hope for.</P>
<P>Seven watched as the forcefield dropped, her heart dropping with it. The
guards moved forward slowly with their weapons held in front of them with expert
ease. They neared B’Elanna’s position and the Borg could take no more. She
glanced down at Naomi, who was pressed against her side, trembling. She couldn’t
abandon the child. She looked onto the container next to her and her eyes locked
on a hyperspanner. She grabbed it and silently drew back her arm and launched it
across the length of the huge cargo bay. Her Borg enhanced strength sent the
projectile hurling against the far wall. It impacted with a thunderous clang as
the tool took a chunk out of the wall.</P>
<P>The Dengari spun toward the sound, and B’Elanna didn’t miss a beat. She had
been timing her move until the most guards were in range of her weapon, and took
the diversion in stride. She eased up from behind her makeshift barricade and
fired on the two closest guards. The impact knocked them into the others and the
group sprawled across the deck. B’Elanna leapt over her barricade and charged
the group, wanting to take as many of them out as possible before they got back
to their feet. She roared as she opened fire on the pile of guards,
unfortunately, one guard had been lingering out in the corridor. He burst into
the room and charged B’Elanna. He had no weapon, but his mass impacted against
her with bone jarring intensity and they both crashed to the floor landing on
top of the pile of Dengari she had already stunned.</P>
<P>The sound of the struggle was too much for Seven. She could see that there
was only one Dengari still standing, and that Dengari had his hands around
B’Elanna’s throat. She pulled away from Naomi, pausing to put the hand phaser
into the child’s hands and then bolted for the conflict.</P>
<P>B’Elanna had actually enjoyed gunning down the Dengari, hoping one of them
was the guard who had let the murderous prisoners into her cell on the transport
ship. She knew they were only stunned, and it was satisfying to see their bodies
contort in pain as they were knocked off their feet. She was not enjoying the
meaty pair of hands squeezing her neck. She kneed the man in the groin, but he
didn’t even flinch, so she tried a head butt, only to find that she became a bit
disoriented by the maneuver. The Dengari had thicker skulls than she had
anticipated. She felt her strength and her vision fading when suddenly the guard
was gone. She vaguely registered his body flying across the room and hitting the
Borg alcoves. She blinked her eyes and looked up at six feet of pissed off
Borg.</P>
<P>"Get up," Seven ordered as she extended her hand. Wisely, B’Elanna took it
without a word and let herself be pulled to her feet, then swooned.</P>
<P>"Ouch," B’Elanna whispered as she rubbed her throat.</P>
<P>"You must rest," she told the Klingon. "I will restrain the Dengari."</P>
<P>The sound of a phaser blast made both women drop to the floor. B’Elanna, even
in her groggy condition, tossed herself over Seven, shielding her wife’s belly
with her own body. Seven and B’Elanna looked at the cargo bay door and saw a
Dengari guard slumped against the wall as he slowly slid to the deck
unconscious, his compression riffle clattering down in front of him. They spun
and looked across the room in time to see Naomi Wildman, her hand still extended
with the phaser pointing at the downed man.</P>
<P>"Told you I was a good shot," she said as she lowered the phaser. She had hit
the Dengari from the length of the cargo bay, a far more difficult shot than any
in a Velocity game.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway waited as Malok leaned forward and spoke into her comm badge. It was
awkward having a seven foot tall Dengari using her chest for a microphone.</P>
<P>"Dengari forces," he said calmly. "This is Malok, captain of the guard."</P>
<P>His voice was even richer and more resonant than Janeway had heard it in the
past, and she decided it must be his command voice. She nodded to him as he
shifted for a better angle at the comm badge.</P>
<P>"I am ordering you to stand down." Malok’s voice was laced with compassion
and the whip of command, a delicate balance. "We have done enough damage. Most
of you know this ‘police action’ was a fool’s folly, and that has been
rectified. The Magistrate has been removed from his position. The Overseer has
made an agreement with these people; this action is over." His voice rumbled
with intensity. "Put your weapons down and wait for the <I>Voyager</I> security
officers to escort you off of the ship. Listen to what your hearts know is
true," he added as he finished.</P>
<P>Janeway nodded at the man, impressed by his ability to show gentleness
without showing weakness. It was a trait she shared with him, but not a common
one by any means.</P>
<P>"This is Captain Janeway to all <I>Voyager</I> crewmembers. You heard Captain
Malok… I want you to continue to sweep the ship, but give any Dengari forces the
opportunity to surrender. I don’t want anyone else getting unnecessarily
injured. Janeway out."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Malok said sincerely.</P>
<P>"Let’s just hope they listened to you," she said as she squeezed his arm.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The majority of the Dengari were glad to give up, most finding the
Magistrate’s obsessive need to capture the <I>Voyager</I> crewmen a perfect
example of his abuse of power. Instead of being a somber occasion, many of the
Dengari placed their riffles on the deck and then sat and patiently waiting to
be rounded up. It was a pleasant outcome to a potentially disastrous
encounter.</P>
<P>The captain went back to the conference room and met with the Overseer,
wanting to clarify things before beaming her back to the Dengari ship.</P>
<P>"Overseer?" she asked as she entered the room. The overseer was sitting
across from her father, who was staring out the window. The Magistrate didn’t
seem to see either woman and was lost in thought.</P>
<P>"Captain, please come in," the tall woman said as she stood. "Thank you for
helping us reach a somewhat peaceful outcome."</P>
<P>"My people have a saying," Janeway said. "No harm, no foul. Although, my ship
did take quite a beating. I’m glad your people used their stun settings."</P>
<P>"It is against our way to use deadly setting when there are innocents
involved," the Overseer explained. "But I am glad you perceive no…foul. I assure
you, I knew nothing of the Magistrate’s plan."</P>
<P>"I know," Janeway said, her voice rich and disarming. "How is your
father?"</P>
<P>"I do not know," the Overseer said honestly. "I have never seen him like
this."</P>
<P>The door opened and Seven and B’Elanna came into the room. B’Elanna
positioned herself between Seven and the Dengari. Janeway hid a smile, touched
by the Klingon’s protective streak. The more she saw the two women together, the
more she knew how happy they were. It was comforting, but it didn’t ease the
ache of loneliness in the captain’s heart.</P>
<P>"Well?" B’Elanna demanded. "Is this madness over?"</P>
<P>"Yes," the Overseer said with a smirk.</P>
<P>"Good," B’Elanna said. "What about him?" She pointed to the Magistrate.</P>
<P>"He is no longer in charge," the young Dengari said sadly.</P>
<P>"Explain," Seven said as she moved closer. "You had the authority to overrule
him all along, and yet you allowed us to be wrongly punished?"</P>
<P>"I may not have agreed with the sentence you received," the Overseer
explained. "But I had to uphold the law. Once the Magistrate exceeded his own
jurisdiction, I was obligated to act."</P>
<P>"Illogical," Seven said as she moved closer to the taller Overseer. "Will you
continue to send people to Jusari Prime?"</P>
<P>"I will take over as Magistrate, if it my people’s will. Then, I will change
the way things are done." The Overseer studied her still silent father. </P>
<P>"Seven, B’Elanna, have a seat," Janeway ordered. She wanted them both to be
part of the healing process, thinking it would help the two hot tempered women
come to a faster resolution if they witnessed the proceedings. The married
couple sat behind the desk, facing the Dengari, and able to see any new
arrivals.</P>
<P>"I hope you hold no ill will," the Overseer said gently. "But I understand if
you do." She looked up when the door opened again and Tuvok came in with Dehar.
</P>
<P>"That remains to be seen," Seven answered.</P>
<P>"Captain," the Overseer said as she pointed to the newcomer. "This is Dehar,
Lieutenant of my guard. I hope that meeting under these circumstances will be
more pleasant. He was following the Magistrate’s orders when he held you at
gunpoint earlier." She felt bad for Dehar, knowing he must be feeling guilty
about beaming in and threatening the captain.</P>
<P>"A pleasure, captain," Dehar said as he extended his hand. His wrist eased
out of his thick armor plated coat sleeves revealing a thick platinum
bracelet.</P>
<P>"Pa’tach!" B’Elanna yelled as she threw her body over the desk and tackled
Dehar. She hit him with her palm, his nose crunching as it shattered. She
followed up with a fist to his throat, leaving him gasping for wheezing gulps of
air as blood poured out his nose. His superior size was useless as he suffocated
on the floor of the conference room.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna!" Janeway yelled as she tried to pull the Klingon off of the
shocked Dengari. "Let him go, that’s an order."</P>
<P>"Not until he’s dead," B’Elanna said with chilling calm as she squeezed his
throat.</P>
