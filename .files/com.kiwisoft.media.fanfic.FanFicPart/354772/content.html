<!-- Seeing for the First Time \ Part 2 -->

<P>TWO DAYS LATER</P>

<P>It was late into the Gamma shift when a scream was wrenched from Seven's throat.  She jumped down off of the bed onto shaking legs and looked around frantically.  She looked and looked but all she saw was darkness.  Her heart felt like it was going to burst right out of her chest and tears streamed down her face.  As time went on and nothing happened, Seven began to realize that what had frightened her so much was just a dream, a nightmare.  One which she could never remember but always felt the dread, the fear, the panic, and pain those images must have caused.  Her second realization was that the darkness was caused by her blindness.  Yes, she was still blind.  The surgery she had had a day ago did nothing to relieve the all out blackness that surrounded her and kept her constant company. It was a failure, just like she was now.  </P>

<P>Seven knew from experience that with these nightmares she wasn't going to be able to fall back asleep.  Usually she would play some music from the computer to listen to or just sit and review old calculations in her head.  But tonight, tonight she was determined to do something different.  But what?  She wasn't going to wake the Doctor nor was she going to call anyone else to keep her company.  She was too scared to step outside of sickbay so taking a walk was out of the question.  So what in the world was she suppose to do?  'The gift'.  The present that Tom had given her.  She had yet to try and figure out what it was. Seven had tried asking others to just tell her what it was but everyone she asked refused.  It seemed that Tom had warned them that any assistance would just defeat the purpose of the gift.  Nor would they even assist her in examining the gift so she just gave up.  She did not need to know what the gift was.  That is until now.</P>

<P>From the first day Tom had given her the gift, Seven knew it was some sort of crystal just by the feeling and shaping of it.  But the only problem was finding out what kind of crystal it was.</P>

<P>"Since no persons were willing to assist me then perhaps the computer will."  But one problem, Seven had to see the computer consoles in order to be able to work them.  Or did she?</P>

<P>As soon as Seven thought of using the computer for help a mental picture popped into, what the Doctor referred to as, her mind's eye.  She could 'see' what the console looked like and thanks to her eidetic memory Seven was able to remember where ever button was located.  'Perhaps this will not be as difficult as I had imagined it would be.'</P>

<P>After about an hours work and a half hour spent fumbling around, Seven had finally been able to discover that it was a data crystal, a holographic data crystal to be precise.  Now she was even more curious as to what Tom's present entailed so she some how managed to load the data crystal into the holo-emitters for sickbay and began the program.</P>

<P>For a few long minute Seven heard nothing, felt nothing, smelt nothing. 'Perhaps the program is damaged,' Seven thought right before she heard a rustle of sheets coming from one of the beds behind her.</P>

<P>"Who is there?"  Seven spun around to face whoever was there.</P>

<P>"Ah so she speaks."  Obviously a man, but was that an ancient Japanese accent he was speaking with?  Seven suddenly felt enraged.  A hologram that she was not able to see.  What usefulness does this program have then?</P>

<P>"Who are you?  State your intentions."  An angry glare issued forth from Seven's usually calm features.</P>

<P>"I believe that a more pertinent question would be who are you?"</P>

<P>"My designation is Seven of Nine.  I now wish to know your designation."</P>

<P>"Ack.  That is not a befitting name for such a young vibrant woman as yourself.  So again I ask who are you?"</P>

<P>"My original designation was Annika Hansen but what shall I refer to you as?"  Seven was beginning to become very frustrated with this little man (yes she knew he was short because of the way his voice floated up towards her).  All she wanted to know was who he was and what his intentions were.</P>

<P>"Ah, Anni.  That is a name that suits you.  But yet you have failed to answer my question.  Once you have done so I will be glad to answer your's.  Who are you?"</P>

<P>"I do not understand what you are asking of me. I have given you my name already."</P>

<P>"Is that all you are made up of?  Is that all that describes who you are?  I see the is much work to be done."  This little Japanese man circled the now perfectly still Seven of Nine.  She was standing in her normal stance with her head held high, shoulders straight, and hands clasped behind her.  For some reason, even though she could not see this man, she knew he was surveying her, sizing her up.</P>

<P>"Do you know of the five aspects in which define a person?"  Seven could only raise her ocular implant as she was now lost as all hell as to where this conversation was headed.  "Then perhaps I shall teach you now, my young grasshopper.  Please have a seat."  Okay now, Seven had gone from extremely angry to extremely frustrated to extremely confused and now she was just extremely amused.  So she humored him.  She sat down on the floor sitting 'indian style' awaiting the next thing this odd little man had to say.</P>

<P>"The five ways in which a person uses to describe himself would be through species, education, profession, family, and faith.  You are human.  I am a hologram.  It is who we are.  You are an intelligent woman as I am a master of the arts.  You are an astrometrics officer.  I am a teacher.  You are a Hansen.  I am a Yokuma.  We are both believers. You are of the faith of the Omega.  I am of the faith of Buddha.  This is who we are.  These are what make us individual.  But is that all that we are?  Is that all that define us as individuals?  Do you have family, Anni?"</P>

<P>"No, they were assimilated over 18 years ago.  I no longer have a family."</P>

<P>"Does that lessen who you are?  Are you no longer a person because you are missing one of the aspects of defining who you are?"</P>

<P>"No, I do not believe so.  I am still an individual and have been welcomed into a new family aboard Voyager.  Perhaps those aspects you spoke of may be outlining points in which help determine who we are but they do not create who we are.  That I believe is left up to the individual to decide."</P>

<P>"Very good, my grasshopper.  You are learning quickly.  But yet still have much more to learn.  We have discovered you are missing one of the aspects of definition but it does not mean that you are not an individual.  So let us compare these five aspects to that of the five senses.  A human has all five senses which allows them to function properly as a human but now I ask if it is like the aspects of definition then if you are missing a sense, for instance your lack of sight, does that cause you to be anything but a human?</P>

<P>"If we are to follow your line of reasoning then no, it does not.  I am still human but rather just...... different.  But am I not also deficient in the fact that I lack all of the faculties needed to function properly?"</P>

<P>"No, not deficient.  That is wrong word to use.  You are different.  You have an added challenge that other humans do not.  You will have to adapt to the lack of sight.  But as you are so fond of saying, you are borg and will adapt because to do anything less would not be in your character."</P>

<P>"And exactly how will I adapt?"  Seven stated a little dismayed that this little man was able to convince her to adapt to the blindness when no one else could.  Not to mention that she was a little angered that she was just out-logicked by a hologram.</P>

<P>"I shall teach you."</P>

<P>And so the real teaching process began.  This hologram who had finally told Seven that his name was Akimo, showed her how to walk with a walking stick to prevent from bumping into walls.  He pointed out that if she counted her steps she would be able to navigate the ship without any help.  He taught her how to describe the location of items by using the old earth descriptions of the face of a clock, ie 1 o'clock, 5 o'clock.  She also learned how to identify certain person's by the feel of their face. Janeway had at one point allowed Seven to learn the shape of her face not only as a means of identification but also as a way to get closer with the ever so distant woman.  For weeks this teaching went on. Gradually, Seven learned to operate in complete darkness.  She was able to step out of sickbay for sometime though only with the company of her 'master'.  She finally began to allow visitors such as Naomi, Tom, Icheb, Kathryn, and even Sam.  And soon Seven began to come out of her self-imposed shell.</P>

<P>As the weeks did pass Seven underwent two other surgeries but neither cured her blindness but they did cause some improvement.  Seven's eyes had suddenly become very sensitive to bright light and contact lens had to be put into her eyes to prevent further damage done to them.  But this did give the Doctor hope that something could still be done to rescue Seven's sight.  Either way, Seven chose not to get her hopes up as she could not handle yet another disappointment so she continued to work with her master further improving her adaptability with blindness. One way she did this was to learn Akido, a martial arts skill.  This was what Akimo was referring to when he called himself the master of the arts. With Akido, sight was the last thing a person would rely on in a confrontation.  You would learn to use your other senses such as hearing your opponent move or breath.  Or feeling the air shift as your opponent moved in closer.  Or smelling the air for a distinct odor that belongs to your opponent.  It was more then she ever wanted to learn about fighting, not even when her life depended on it in the tsunkatse matches did she want to learn.  But here, it's helping her in other ways. Learning to fight is a side effect of her training not the focus.</P>

<P>It was now five weeks later since Seven had first been in that fateful mission.  As of a week ago the program of Akimo Yukoma had shut itself down as the program had reached it's limits of function but it had left Seven with enough knowledge of the arts to continue her training on her own.</P>

<P>It was such a night that Seven found herself with the need to train.  It was a very frustrating day as today was her first day back to any real work.  Due to her blindness, Seven could not return to her job of astrometrics officer so she was given a position in engineering.  But nothing seemed to go right for her.  She made a total fool of herself and in front of Lt. Torres at that.  Dropping tools, bumping into things, connecting the wrong wires.  Seven was a mess of frustration all day and now that things were quiet she was going to let it all out. Seven had returned to sickbay so as to activate her training partner Akimo and just began to fight.  Each punch, each kick, each block serving to let out her frustration, her anger at the world, serving to help her to focus her energy.  Seven had become so apt at her newly acquired skill that she was able to match anything and everything thrown at her.  Roundhouse kick, block, jab, block, block, sidestep, axe, hit to the jaw, bloody mouth, right hook, left hook, bruised cheek bone, back flip, flying kick, block, cartwheel over biobed, silence, sudden rush of air, sidestep, flipped body over left shoulder, kneeling down, jab to the throat, broken airway, death.  Breathing heavily Seven stood feeling move centered and alert and that's when she heard it.  Someone else was in the room.  She could hear them breath.  She could smell an out of place musk only a few feet away.</P>

<P>"Who is there?"  Seven hissed through clenched teeth.  Not only was her privacy disturbed but this person had been watching her for a while now without her knowledge.  That ticked off the ex-borg more then the invasion of privacy.  How could she not hear the doors swish open.</P>

<P>So when an answer was not forth coming Seven decided to act allowing her emotions free reign. With a forward roll so quick that if you would blinked you would have missed it and she now stood in front of the intruder.  With a quick leg sweep she was now pinning this person to the floor.</P>

<P>"Identify yourself."  The intruder flinched from the venom that dripped from Seven's words but still refused to acknowledge the demand.  </P>

<P>So Seven did the only thing she could think of to identify this person. With a sure but gentle hand she reached out to feel the face she was now only mere inches from.  Starting with the cheeks Seven used the pads of her fingers to paint a picture in her mind of who it was she was now with.</P>

<P>"You are a female judging from your body structure but are not the Captain.  Her cheek bones are less prominent and perhaps slightly higher."  Seven moved down to the chin.  "Nor are you Samantha Wildman as her chin has a small dimple right here."  Seven caressed the spot in which she was referring to.  Her movements slowly became less harsh and more sensual as they continued their journey down the neckline and back up the other side.  "I do not know who else you could be as there would be no one else aboard this ship stupid enough to confront me the way you just have.  Perhaps misguided bravery."  Seven smirked as she began to have fun with her captive.  The woman still refused to give up who she was so Seven continued on.  Making her way back up to the chin, Seven's thumb began a slow caress of the luscious lips she found just above. This elicited an escaped gasp from the until now silent woman and cause Seven's smirk to turn into an all out devilish grin.  Leaning down, Seven whispered in the woman's ear,</P>

<P>"Your sounds give you away intruder.  You are enjoying this."  It wasn't a question or even a statement but rather a challenge.  One this woman was up to taking.  She was not about to let Seven get away with that.  So when Seven's index finger followed the same path her thumb had just traced, she parted her lips.  Taking the digit into her mouth the woman ever so slowly sensually sucked, licked, and even nipped at the trapped finger.  It was now Seven's turn to gasp but her's was also followed a deep moan of pleasure.</P>

<P>The woman laying underneath Seven couldn't believe what was happening. Here she was with the renowned ice queen watching her sensually caress her face and enjoying it.  Then returning that same pleasure to someone she thought would never be able to feel anything.  Looking up into the eyes that could no longer see, she saw what it was that she was blind to.  Seven did feel, she did have emotions just like the rest of us. She was just better at hiding those emotions under shielded eyes.  But those eyes no longer were shielded thanks to her blindness.  The woman was finally able to see for the first time all she had been blind to.  </P>

<P>Seven's other hand made it's way up past the cheeks to lovingly caress the eye lids of this unidentified person.  Effectively closing her eyes as well.  The hand that had only moments ago been trapped between warm inviting lips also made it's way up passed well defined cheek bones to glide across a strong forehead.  But that's when Seven pulled away as if she had been burned.  Scrambling to her feet Seven backed up too quickly only to come crashing down again when she bumped into something hard and solid.  With wide eyes she looked to where she assumed the woman still was.</P>

<P>"Lt. Torres?"</P>

<P>"No, it's B'Elanna."  </P>

<P>Seven jumped at the voice being so close to her ear but this time she couldn't move as Lanna had grabbed hold of the borg's waist this time pinning her down.  Now it was her turn.</P>

<P>Lanna's fingers slowly made there way up all the curves that made up Seven's body.  Reaching the neck Lanna couldn't hold back her own moan of pleasure as Seven unwittingly arched her back into the touch.  She caressed the star burst implant ever so lovingly before she moved onto the more delectable chin to fondle the crease in the middle.  Her thumb was then given the same treatment as she had given Seven's index finger when she had moved up to the blood red lips just begging to be touched. Seven licked, sucked, and nipped at the thumb in which she held entrapped between her lips.  The Klingon's other hand softly slide its way up and passed the cheeks up until she came to the ocular implant covering Seven's left eyebrow.  But Seven flinched away, for some reason not wanting Lanna to touch that part of her but the gentle 'please' which was whispered in her ear quickly erased any and all fears regarding her borgness.</P>

<P>"You are so beautiful, Seven and I'm sorry it's taken me so long to see that.  I came here earlier to tell you not to be embarrassed or ashamed when you make mistakes in front of me.  I came to tell you that I understand and it's okay.  But when I walked into the room and saw you moving so gracefully despite being blind I couldn't bring myself to say a thing.  I was so impressed and blown away by all the emotional power you had put into your movements.  That's when I realized just how human you really were.  I'm just sorry that it took your loss of sight for me to finally gain mine.  I'm sorry."</P>

<P>Torres leaned down the inch or two further to place a feather light kiss on the lips she had moments ago caressed.  But it was Seven who had deepened the kiss wanting to now caress those lush lips with her tongue rather then fingers.  She wanted to paint a new type of picture for her to see.</P>

<P>"Show me, B'Elanna.  I want to see."</P>
