<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 24 -->

<p>Sam sat on the bench overlooking the pond, watching in fascination as two ducks circled and tried to peck at each other. She laughed as she compared them to herself and Brooke, the two small ducks reminding her of their earlier relationship. </p>
<p>Sam laughed, imagining them fifty years from now, exchanging gentle insults, sitting on a porch somewhere at some old folks home, hitting each other over the head with their walking sticks, like some bad cartoon. </p>
<p>She smiled. Frankly, she didn't care where she was, just as long Brooke was right there beside her. Shaking her head in embarrassment, she wondered where all the romantic, lovey dovey stuff had come from. </p>
<p>She never thought she had it in her.</p>
<p>Sam glanced at her watch, wondering where Alex was. She was deeply concerned when Alex had informed her that he was calling from her place, all alone with Brooke, and Sam wondered whether she would find an ambulance sitting outside if she were to rush home.</p>
<p>She stood up in relief when she saw Alex walking down the path, her expression sympathetic when she saw his face. Brooke had really whacked him one. </p>
<p>"Hi" he greeted with a smile, kissing her on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Ouch" she said, touching the side of his face gently. "Does it hurt?"</p>
<p>"Like you wouldn't believe" he replied. "Of course, it happened while I tried to heroically save an old lady from getting robbed by a gang of ten huge guys".</p>
<p>She laughed. "Your secret is safe with me".</p>
<p>"Good" he said with a smile, sitting down on the bench. </p>
<p>"I'm glad to see that you escaped from further injury" she joked, sitting down beside him. "You didn't tie her up and gag her, did you?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, wondering why he didn't think of that.</p>
<p>"We were quite pleasant to each other actually" he answered, looking out over the pond. He smiled as Sam just stared at him. "Mostly pleasant, anyway".</p>
<p>"Talk about anything interesting?" she asked, watching him closely.</p>
<p>He hesitated. "Not really. I used the phone and left".</p>
<p>"Oh" Sam replied, not quite believing him. They sat and watched the pond for a few minutes, neither of them knowing where to begin.</p>
<p>"I don't want to lose you Sam" Alex said, breaking the silence between them. "I'm sorry if I scared you away last night, I just wanted you to know how I felt about you".</p>
<p>"I know and I'm so sorry for reacting the way I did" Sam replied, turning towards him. "I just got....scared and I didn't know how to deal with it".</p>
<p>"So you ran to Brooke" Alex stated, looking away.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't actually" Sam replied sharply. "She has this idea you're jealous because you have it in your head that something happened between us last night. Is that true?"</p>
<p>"Did something happen?" He asked instead, watching her.</p>
<p>"No!" Sam answered, annoyed. "I explained why she was there, why don't you believe me?"</p>
<p>"I do believe you Sam" he said. "I just...I was hurt, okay? You don't confide in me, you shut me out, yet if this afternoon was any indication, you have no problems letting Brooke in. Why is that?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean for that to happen Alex" Sam responded, realizing she was using Brooke's earlier arguments. "It's not as if I leapt on top of her". </p>
<p>Sam blushed at her hypocrisy, as she recalled inviting Brooke to lie in her arms while they watched the storm together. </p>
<p>"Alex, I'm not one for letting people in, okay?" Sam tried to explain. "I find it very hard and I know that my distance is hurting you and I'm sorry. It's a protective thing, you know? It's like a barrier I keep around myself and I've been doing it for so long, I don't know how to take it down. And it's not just with you, it's with everyone".</p>
<p><i>Even Brooke, just less so.</i></p>
<p>"You don't need that barrier around me, Sam" Alex replied, taking her hand. "I would never hurt you intentionally".</p>
<p>"I know that" Sam answered, "but it's easier said than done".</p>
<p>Alex nodded, waiting patiently as Sam gathered her thoughts.</p>
<p>"I need to be honest with you Alex" she began, her voice cracking. "I love you. I really do, but...." She stopped, looking away as her eyes began to fill up with tears. Turning back, she watched as Alex let go of her hand. "I don't think I'm in love with you".</p>
<p>She paused, her voice gentle. </p>
<p>"I <i>know</i> I'm not in love with you, and I can't love you the way you want me too".</p>
<p>She watched as Alex turned away, tears sliding down his cheeks.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. You are everything that I could ever want in a guy, but..." she stopped. "It's just not happening". She sat there quietly, head bowed, as her own tears began to fall. She looked up as Alex once again turned towards her. </p>
<p>"I can wait, Sam. Give you as much time as you need. We can make this work, you and I..." he leant forward, grabbing her gently. "We make a great team".</p>
<p>Sam looked away as Alex continued to plead.</p>
<p>"You can't just give up on a relationship once you hit some problems. We'll work through them together. We can do this!"</p>
<p>Sam turned towards him, smiling sadly. Leaning forward she kissed him on the lips.</p>
<p>"You're a great guy Alex, and you deserve someone who will love you completely". Kissing him gently on the forehead, she stood up. "But it's not me".</p>
<p>Taking one last look at the devastated figure, she turned and walked away.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry".</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke lay on her bed, her eyes fixed on the ceiling, and no matter how loud she cranked up her stereo, his words just kept on echoing inside her head.</p>
<p>"<i>I'm not wrong when I say you are in love with her, am I?"</i></p>
<p><i>"I'm not wrong when I say you are in love with her, am I?"</i></p>
<p><i>"I'm not wrong when I say you are in love with her, am I?"</i></p>
<p>Brooke was almost certain that Alex would tell Sam, imagining all sorts of scenarios, each of them ending with Alex and Sam laughing at her, at how stupid she was to go and fall for her stepsister of all people. She sat up, frustrated, wondering why she didn't just deny everything. Especially to Alex. It would have been the smart thing to do, right? </p>
<p>But no, Brooke McQueen was an idiot, with a capital dumb ass. </p>
<p>Grabbing the book on her night stand, she flung it at the farthest wall with all her might, feeling a sense of satisfaction as a small dent made a welcome appearance.</p>
<p>Reaching for another book to throw, she stopped when she saw Sam standing quietly in her doorway. She jumped up and switched the stereo off, standing awkwardly beside her bed as Sam just watched her.</p>
<p>"Whatever he said, I deny it with every inch of my being" she blurted out.</p>
<p>Sam looked at her oddly. "He didn't say anything about you".</p>
<p>"I knew that" she mumbled embarrassed, mentally slapping herself upside the head.</p>
<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to give you a set of instructions okay? And you're going to follow them" Sam said, quietly. "Without question".</p>
<p>"Uh, sure" Brooke replied, concerned. </p>
<p>"Lie on your bed".</p>
<p>Brooke stared at her for a moment before she complied. </p>
<p>"Open your arms".</p>
<p>Sam watched as Brooke silently did what she was told. Closing the door behind her, and switching off the light, she walked over and climbed onto the bed, throwing her arm over Brooke's waist and burying her face in her neck.</p>
<p>"Now hold me while I cry, okay?" she whispered, as she began to sob.</p>
<p>"Okay" Brooke answered softly, tightening her hold on the brunette. </p>
<p>Guessing that Sam had ended her relationship with Alex, she closed her eyes in sympathy, for Sam and for him, knowing that no matter how badly Sam was hurting now, Alex was feeling it ten times worse.</p>
<p>Brooke genuinely hoped that Alex had someone to hold him right now.</p>
