<p><i>"Seriously? And you felt like you were drowning? That's disgusting!"</i></p>
<p><i>"I know! You think he could have warned me that he had salivary gland problems!"</i></p>
<p><i>"That would have been a common courtesy. But over time, its possible you can train him. Without him knowing, of course."</i></p>
<p><i>"Train him? I suppose. Is that what you did with your college boyfriend?"</i></p>
<p><i>"This is a bit embarrassing, but it was him who taught me."</i></p>
<p><i>"For real? You seem like a natural to me, and I've just met you."</i></p>
<p><i>"..."</i></p>
<p><i>"Olivia? Isn't this where you said you lived?"</i></p>
<p><i>"Hm? Oh, right! Yes it is, thank you for paying attention."</i></p>
<p><i>"No problem."</i></p>
<p><i>The two young ladies stopped in front of a large house after they had escaped the debutante party of doom. After the event, the two had spent the evening talking about random subjects, mostly getting to each other. Discovering how late the two had been conversing, Viola had offered to walk Olivia home, which she had gladly accepted.</i></p>
<p><i>Viola whistled at the impressive structure that made her feel minuscule. "Nice. Your family's got some dough, huh?" Viola said teasingly.</i></p>
<p><i>"You should see our other two houses. This one is our smallest." Olivia said.</i></p>
<p><i>"... Is that so? I feel like I've won the lottery meeting you!" Viola said this with a big grin and wrapping her arm around Olivia's shoulders possessively, making Olivia squeak in surprise.</i></p>
<p><i>"Stop that, you're making me blush!" the blond said, hiding her face in her hands.</i></p>
<p><i>"What for? I'm just saying that we should be best pals."</i></p>
<p><i>"Oh... D-don't say it in such an embarrassing way!"</i></p>
<p><i>"Hmm, this dress is making you a stiff, Liv!... Why don't we get you out of it?"</i></p>
<p><b>Wait a minute... That is NOT what I had said!</b></p>
<p><i>"... Okay.</i></p>
<p><b>WHAT!</b></p>
<p><i>"But please be gentle... No need to tear the fabric."</i></p>
<p><i>"I'll make you flexible one way or another!" </i></p>
<p><i>RIP!</i></p>
<p><i>"I said not to tear the fabric!"</i></p>
<p><i>"Lets do it in front of your house!"</i></p>
<p><i>"Why don't we take it to the nearest soccer stadium?"</i></p>
<p><i>"You know me so well!"</i></p>
<p><b>WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE? DAVID BECKHAM IS THE ONLY ONE I WOULD FANTASIZE WITH IN THE SOCCER STADIUM! WHY IS OLIVIA IN MY HEAD?</b></p>
<p><i>"Yes, Viola, right there!"</i></p>
<p><i>"Say my name! Say my name!"</i></p>
<p><i>(insert whipping sounds here)</i></p>
<p><i>"VIOLA!"</i></p>
<p><b>THAT'S IT! I'M SO OUT OF THIS DREAM!</b></p>
<p>"I've found Carmen Sandiego!" Viola blurted out groggily as she sat up suddenly in bed, sweat on her brow and slightly out of breath. She glanced quickly around her dorm room and checked her wig reflexively. <i>What the heck was up with that dream? </i>she found herself wondering. Though she was having trouble grasping the memory of her dream, she did know it was enough to startled her awake. If only she could remember it...</p>
<p>Soccer ball to the face was the answer she got.</p>
<p>"GAH!" Viola fell back on her bed from the force of the ball hitting her between the eyes.</p>
<p>"Get up! Time to start your training." Duke's voice said authoritatively before he walked out of the room they shared. Viola rubbed her face, trying to lessen the stinging sensation.</p>
<p>"Son of a..!" she started mumbling irritably as she stumbled out of bed and followed Duke out of the room, dream forgotten. Whipping sounds echoed distantly in her head for some strange and unknown reason as she closed the door.</p>
<p>"Kya! My back!" Viola groaned as she made her way into the girl's shower room. Sweat and grass stains covered every inch of her tired and bruised body. She had removed her wig to sneak in inconspicuously beforehand. Training under Duke proved more challenging than she had previously expected, but she was learning a lot. Ending the work out with 100 push-ups was also not her cup of tea, but Duke refused to let her leave until she had completed them.</p>
<p>"Shower time!" she said enthusiastically as she removed her dirty clothes and tossed them over her shoulder precariously as she made her way towards the shower curtain. She pushed it aside and stepped into it without a thought and was met with freezing cold water. Viola gasped at the unexpected temperature and jerked back reflexively, the skin of her shoulder colliding with what felt like even more skin. The brunette had bumped into someone, causing them to slip and fall with a feminine squeal, hands shooting out to find purchase on something which happened to be Viola's body. Viola found herself being jerked off her feet as well, body too tired to resist, and landed on top of someone.</p>
<p>The events had happened so fast, the soccer player was dazed and confused as to why her head was nestled on something soft when she landed. She lifted her head to look down at the person she had accidentally knocked into and her eyes widened at the sight of her friend, Olivia. The blond was staring up at her in alarm, mouth agape.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, Olivia, are you okay?" Viola asked hurriedly in immediate concern. "I'm so sorry, I didn't see you! Are you hurt? Hows your head?" Viola grew worried when Olivia didn't answer and brushed the wet blond hair away from her friend's face and cupped her cheek in concern. "Olivia?"</p>
<p>Despite the cold water Olivia had been showering under (because of those damn dreams!) dripping from Viola's face onto her own, Olivia's body felt like it would burst into flames from embarrassment and arousal. Viola saying her name made her screw her eyes shut to the sight of her physical and mental torture, and when Viola shifted on top of her to again ask if she was okay, she had to bite her lip to keep from moaning.</p>
<p>"Get out." Olivia managed ground out through gritted teeth. "Get off me and get out!" Olivia ordered more forcefully when the delicious weight on top of her didn't remove itself.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" Viola apologized profusely as she moved off her friend. She offered to help her up but Olivia just yelled even louder to get out of the shower. Viola rushed out like Olivia's angry voice was chasing her, and closed the curtain behind her. Viola felt very stupid and embarrassed at the events that had just transpired.</p>
<p>Her cheeks grew warm when she recalled the position they had been in, Viola lying in between Olivia's legs and her head landing on Olivia's very soft, ahem, assets. She hurriedly clasped her hands over her eyes as if that would banish the thoughts, and instead recalled how their naked skin had felt against each other. The thoughts she was suddenly having towards her friend made her feel shameful, considering Olivia had sounded pissed. She quickly gathered her clothes to leave and wait for a safer time when she could take that shower.</p>
<p>"Sorry." she said again to the quiet room.</p>
<p>Olivia rested her head against the wall tiles, blushing profusely. The last thing she needed was to see Naked Viola a second time AND know what it felt like to have Naked Viola on top of her, like in all those ridiculously cursed dreams. At this point, Olivia was very concerned about her own mental health. She banged her forehead against the wall again. "Son of a..!"</p>
