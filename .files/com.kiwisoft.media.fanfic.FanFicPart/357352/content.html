<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 3-->

<p>Sam's eye's drifted away from her pasta salad up and over to a table across
the room.  Actually it wasn't so much the table that interested her as it
was the pretty blonde girl sitting at the table.  It had been two days since
'the incident' and with the exception of sitting beside each other in
biology class-and they didn't even have to do that much since they were
doing labs-they had pretty much succeeded at avoiding each other every
minute of the day.  And, when they were forced into contact they were both
painfully polite to each other and utterly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Trouble in paradise?" Harrison, the token boy-though a cute one-of their
group asked looking at Sam thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What?" Sam asked distractedly ripping her eyes off of Brooke.</p>

<p>"What's up with the two of you?" Lilly asked looking at Sam and then at
Brooke who had been watching them but averted her eyes when she caught them
looking at her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'the two of us'?" Sam asked suspiciously.  "There's
nothing going on, if something was going on I'd know because I'd be part of
the something, and I'm not part of anything.  Why?  What have you heard?
Who have you been talking to?  It's not true," Sam said her eyes flickering
between her three alarmed friends.</p>

<p>"Whoa," Carmyn commented gazing at Sam who was beyond agitated.  "Calm down
Sam. We're just concerned is all.  You've been acting...bizarrely lately
that's all.  We just thought that maybe it had something to do with Brooke,
and the two of you being all alone together."</p>

<p>"Brooke? Ha!" Sam said, "You're crazy.  Why would anything have to do with
Brooke?"  Then she stopped speaking and turned to look at Carm
distrustfully.  "Hey, what do you mean by 'alone together'?  Just what are
you insinuating?"</p>

<p>"Sam, girl, calm down," Harrison said exchanging looks with the other two
people at the table who weren't acting like lunatics.  "She wasn't
insinuating anything.  We just know about you and Brooke."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" Sam asked looking alarmed suddenly.  "Have you talked to
her?  What did she say?  Whatever she said don't believe her she started
it!"</p>

<p>"Started what?" Lilly asked confused.</p>

<p>Sam took a deep shuttering breath and looked around at her friends.  They
had absolutely no idea what she was talking about.  She was acting like a
lunatic, she just had to calm down.  Brooke wouldn't tell anyone what
happened, and she hadn't told anyone what happened.  Her friends were just
curious because she was acting like a weirdo...that was going to stop.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Sam answered finally in a considerable calmer tone.  "I'm sorry,
I know I've been acting kinda crazy for the past few days.  It's just...you're
right, you know?  Being coped up with Barberlla has kind of put me on edge."</p>

<p>"Kind of?" Lily asked raising a bemused eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Alright, I crossed the chasm into temporary insanity," Sam responded
forcing a smile onto her face to go along with the shake of her head.  When
she looked over at them to gauge their reactions she saw that they were all
still looking at her expectantly.  Meeting their gaze Sam quickly decided
that maybe a small infusion of truth into her argument would help it along.
"She just does something to me," Sam added softly shaking her head.  She
knew that they would believe that.  Nobody irritated her as much as Brooke,
nobody angered her, or interested her...or attracted her like Brooke.</p>

<p>"The two of you are going to be living together for a long time, you've got
to learn to get along with her," Harrison responded.  He could never really
wrap his mind around Sam's utter and complete intolerance/hatred of Brooke.
She was by far the least putrid member of the popular crowd.  While she was
sometimes led astray by them, she tried to be a nice person.</p>

<p>"Or at least tolerate her," Carmen added.  She really hated it when Sam and
Brooke were fighting.  Sam was her closet friend and Brooke was someone she
admired and a person that had always treated her with respect.  It just
didn't seem right that the two of them were always at each others throats.</p>

<p>"I'm trying.  Really.  We're making an effort," Sam replied.  She really
wanted to get the subject off of Brooke.  She was thinking about Brooke
entirely too much-especially at night-and it had to stop.</p>

<p>"Right....like glaring at each other from across crowded rooms.  Yeah, I can
see the progress you've made already," Harrison drawled sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Funny.  It just so happens that we had a civil dinner together no more than
two nights ago, okay?"  She hoped that at least something useful would come
out of that night, her friends would leave her alone.</p>

<p>"Please tell me I'm not the only one that realizes that's when you started
acting weird," Lily interjected.</p>

<p>"It doesn't count if the bonding causes increases of hatred," Harrison
added.</p>

<p>"What is this?  The Spanish Inquisition?  Can we please just have a nice
conversation without mentioning Brooke McQueen?"  Sam asked exasperated.
She just couldn't deal with this anymore.  Apparently that became obvious to
her table mates for they all grudgingly agreed to move onto greener
pastures.</p>

<p>
Brooke ripped her eyes away from Sam's from when she saw the brunette and
her friends turn and look her way.  Trying her best for nonchalance she
focused on Nicole who seemed to be talking to her.</p>

<p>"What's going on between you and Spam anyway Brookie?  Captain S and the
Super Freaks are acting even weirder than normal."</p>

<p>"It's nothing...just normal Sam stuff," Brooke responded distractedly as her
eyes ventured back over to Sam's table.  "What do you think they're talking
about, they've been looking over here a lot.  I think they're talking about
me.  Do you think they're talking about me?  I wonder what they're talking
about?" Brooke rattled off in a dream-like tone.</p>

<p>"Honey, you're going to have to leave that with the answering service or ask
me one at a time," Nicole responded watching Brooke with narrow eyes.  She
could tell that something was going on with the natural blonde, something
big, and that it had everything in the world to do with Spam McPherson.</p>

<p>Brooke turned her head to the side and gazed at her friend smiling.  Nicole
was a constant, unchanging in her charming viciousness and absolute loyalty,
and Brooke desperately needed that at the moment.</p>

<p>"Never mind.  Sam's just making me crazy," Brooke responded.  "Where're the
boys at?" she asked changing the subject.  Sam, was something she definitely
didn't want to talk about.  Hell, she didn't even want to think about her.
As Nicole rattled off some answer Brooke's gazed drifted back over to Sam
McPherson and settle there with a surprising intensity that didn't go
unnoticed by her companion.</p>
