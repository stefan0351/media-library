<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Four -->

<p>Brooke sat down on the park bench next to Mouse. They were both quiet for a long time, staring out over the water. Finally, Brooke couldn't stand the silence any longer.</p>
<p>"So, where does this leave us?" she asked Mouse. Mouse sighed and turned to glare at her.</p>
<p>"You hit her," she growled accusingly. "You know what I SHOULD do to you because of that." Brooke hung her head.</p>
<p>"I know. Really, I do. And I still can't forgive myself for it no matter how much Sam says she does and begs me to let it go. I hurt her in the worst way possible," she wept.</p>
<p>"I warned you what would happen if you ever hurt her," Mouse reminded Brooke. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"You said you'd find your way back, somehow," she picked up her head and looked at her angry counterpart. "Is that why we're here now? Have you come to take back your rightful place?"</p>
<p>Mouse was quiet for a long time after Brooke asked that. She looked back out over the water silently thinking. Finally coming to a hard decision, she sighed and started speaking.</p>
<p>"It's not my place anymore," she said sadly. "You were right, I blew my chance and you benefited from it. I can't come fully back anymore than you can keep fighting your memories, Brooke. There has to be a middle road somewhere between us and we have to find it. And find a way to make it work."</p>
<p>"You've become too strong a person on your own for me to really reemerge, Brooke. Besides, knowing everything you do, how you once were compared to how you now are, would you really be content to go BACK?" Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"I didn't think so," Mouse pointed out and then sighed. "So, we have to meet in the middle." Brooke looked at her fearfully.</p>
<p>"What does that mean? How do we do that?" Mouse fixed her with an intent stare.</p>
<p>"First, you need to stop fighting the returning memories. Don't deny it, you're STILL doing it. And it's making you edgy again. Accept them, Brooke, with the knowledge that you're not going anywhere. You'll still be you only with all the pieces in the right places." Brooke sighed and nodded.</p>
<p>"But what about you?" she asked. "You'd still be a part of me."</p>
<p>"Yes," Mouse agreed. "But I have to let go. It's not my life to live anymore. I'd have to stop fighting YOU. And envying you and what you have that I was too scared to go after."</p>
<p>"But what'll happen to you if you do that?" Brooke asked suddenly afraid for her counterpart. She knew what it felt like to fear for your existence. Mouse shrugged.</p>
<p>"I'd still be there, but I'd fade into the background. I'd eventually become a memory once you'd fully adapted and readjusted. I'd be a part of you, but a small one."</p>
<p>"Oh," Brooke said in response. "So, basically we'd have to work together?"</p>
<p>"Yup," Mouse answered.</p>
<p>"That's going to be hard for a while," Brooke pointed out. </p>
<p>"Yup," Mouse repeated, a smirk gracing her features.</p>
<p>"We can do it," Brooke said confidently. </p>
<p>"Yup," Mouse agreed with a grin.</p>

<p>Brooke woke up with a yawn and wrapped her arms around Sam who was still asleep. She cuddled up against Sam's back and sighed. Her mind was all ready racing with thoughts and memories that left her slightly dizzy. Holding on to Sam gave her an anchor and chased away her fear.</p>
<p>She saw numerous fights with Sam, a spectacular food fight at school, betrayal at the hands of Nicole, and several other things before her mind came to rest on one memory in particular. The morning when she was nine and she woke to find her mother gone.</p>
<p>Pain, fresh as the day it happened ripped through her at the realization that her own mother had abandoned her. </p>
<p>&lt;What did I do wrong?&gt; she frantically thought to herself. &lt;Was I that bad of a person? God, will Sammy do the same thing? Why didn't my mother love me?&gt; Unknown to her as she thought, sobs were tumbling from her mouth. Sam woke up and turned around in the crying blonde's arms.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, baby?" Sam cooed, brushing her fingertips across Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"My?my mommy left me," Brooke responded in a small childlike voice. Realizing that the horrible memory of her mother's abandonment must have returned, Sam's heart ached for Brooke. She engulfed the upset girl in her arms and held on to her tightly as the thin frame was rocked with tremors.</p>
<p>"Shhh, baby, it's OK. That was a long time ago," Sam tried to soothe.</p>
<p>"Why did she leave me? Was I bad? Why, Sammy? Why?" Brooke cried near hysterics. Sam held on to her tighter.</p>
<p>"You're not bad, baby," she said lovingly. "You weren't then and you aren't now. Your Mom had issues or something that she couldn't deal with. THAT'S why she left. It was nothing you did. Honest."</p>
<p>"She didn't love me," Brooke wailed. Sam stroked her hair and kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>"Yes, she did. In her own way. But, she couldn't stay because of her own problems, Brooke. She loved you. She still does," Sam tried to reassure her.</p>
<p>"She left me," Brooke sniffled. "Are you going to leave me, Sammy?" Sam gasped.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke! God, no! I love you. Why would you even think that?"</p>
<p>"My mommy loved me and she left me. Please don't leave me, Sammy. I?I need you," Brooke begged, burrowing herself against Sam's chest. Sam felt a horrible pain in her own chest at the emotional agony Brooke was living through again because of her mother. Sam disliked Kelly McQueen Foster more and more as time went by.</p>
<p>"I promise I won't," Sam whispered. "I need you too, Brooke." Brooke seemed to calm down after a while at hearing those words from Sam. She lay quietly in Sam's arms, partially on the brunette's chest for a long while thinking. An occasional sniffle or whimper still passed through her as she lay there. </p>
<p>"That's why?" she started. "The eating disorder. That started it, right?" she finally broke the silence by asking.</p>
<p>Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"From what you told me, yes. You thought if you were perfect enough?"</p>
<p>"She'd come back. But she never did," Brooke said sadly. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, honey, she didn't. I'm sorry," she said honestly. Brooke sniffled.</p>
<p>"It's?it's OK, Sam. It was just hard getting it all back at once like that. It was like it just happened and I was right back there in that moment. But I understand a lot more now. Plus, if you think about it, if she'd stayed, my dad and your mom wouldn't have gotten together. And we might not have either." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"That's a good way of looking at it," she pointed out. Brooke lifted her head and kissed Sam lightly on the lips.</p>
<p>"Thank you for being here for me," she said sincerely. Sam's smiled grew wider.</p>
<p>"No place I'd rather be."</p>
