<!-- My Protector \ Prologue -->

<p>Weeks of suffering from a mysterious illness had dramatically changed
the Empress of Dethra from a vibrant woman to a frail bag of bones. Knowing
death was near she summoned what strength she had left and called for her
daughter. She desperately hoped Sarika was ready to take on all the
responsibilities of leadership. Ready or not, she would become the new empress
at a time when rebellion threatened the empire. Sarika’s religious activities
left little room for the strategies of politics and warfare. Her daughter would
have to depend on the Council of Elders for guidance as she herself had done.
The Empress hoped to pass on to Sarika more than a mantle of responsibility.</p>
<p>The Princess arrived, pale auburn hair mingling with the green of her robe
gliding behind her. She brushed past the somber-faced priestesses and elders to
reach her mother’s bedside. Clutching her daughter’s hands to her chest the
frail empress sought to empower her only child.</p>
<p>&quot;The future of Dethra is with you Sarika. Don’t waste time mourning
over me when my spirit leaves, but take care to rule wisely and put an end to
this rebellion of the Menials. The empire must not fall.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika moved closer to grip her mother’s hands while remaining mindful of
her position and the importance of showing no weakness. As she always did when
she felt tears threaten to betray her, she thrust her delicate chin forward and
rose to the occasion.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be as you ask mother.&quot;</p>
<p>Words came much softer now as the Empress allowed herself to gaze fondly into
her daughter’s liquid green eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I know it will. But you will need more than the priestesses and elders
to help you restore peace to Dethra, and more than the spirits of your
ancestors. Before long you will enter the time of union. Your power will
increase with the strength of your mate.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika frowned, a brief lapse in her self-control. She had not selected
anyone from among the eligible. She was not physically attracted to any of them
even though the unmarried ones had made their interest in her clear one way or
another. Even now she could feel Elder Tai-Po watching her with what she
believed to be lust. She wished she could be alone with her mother but protocol
would not allow it.</p>
<p>&quot;Since you haven’t chosen yet,&quot; the Empress continued, &quot;join
yourself with me and together we will call forth a vision of the Protector and
hasten him to come to you daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>Elder Tai-Po stood close to the Empress and her daughter, trusting that their
vision would be of him. He considered himself the best choice and he wanted
Princess Sarika. He watched her grow from a spoiled and precocious child to a
spoiled and beautiful young woman. A woman whose aura of power wielded from that
sensual little body stirred his passion to a fevered pitch. Although it was
forbidden, he watched Sarika during her morning meditation in the palace garden.
Every sunrise he found himself responding to the sight of her rising from the
sacred pond and while enjoying this irreligious voyeurism he often pleasured
himself to his own vision of her body beneath his. Now Tai-Po stifled a groan,
acknowledging to himself that he would soon have her. Eyes narrowed, he watched
the Empress and her daughter place their hands on each other’s temples.</p>
<p>The Empress spoke to her daughter without using her voice. Focus from the
center of you being and join with me. We seek your mate, the Protector. Who will
it be? Perspiration began to bead on the faces of both women as Sarika’s life
force joined with her mother’s and together they reached into the unknown,
searching.</p>
<p>Sarika searched with her whole being. '<i>Who</i>?' She felt a new and
unexplainable yearning well up inside of her and flow over her own boundary. '<i>Where
are you? I need you. Come to me</i>.' An image began to take shape and both
women felt the joy of success until the form became clear. The Empress gasped
and the color drained from her daughter’s face while they both surveyed the
striking olive-skinned figure. Windblown hair, long and black as midnight,
whipped across lean-muscled shoulders. Pale blue eyes revealed a spirit of great
passion. Strong hands rested on hips supported by exquisitely formed thighs and
calves, balanced on long-toed feet. Altogether, unfathomable strength and
purpose radiated from the person before them. Unlike anyone Sarika had ever seen
before, the woman was as beautiful as she was unexpected. And whoever she was,
she would never be the Protector. Mother and daughter pulled their hands away
and the vision vanished leaving Sarika with a disturbing sense of loss.</p>
<p>The Empress stretched a trembling hand to her daughter’s shoulder and
pulled her down until lips were close to her ear and she whispered breathlessly,
&quot;The woman must be a key to finding your mate…. She’s on her way here.
Let her be your counselor. That’s the role I sense the dark one to have in
your life…Listen to her with your heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will mother.&quot;</p>
