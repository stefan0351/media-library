<p>The warrior quickly took in the
		sight before her. The bard stood on tiptoe on a flimsy upended log, arms tied
		behind her, and neck stretched taught by a rope over a tree branch. Tanos,
		wannabe warlord, stood beside her laughing, taunting. "I see the stories are
		true. Xena's grown soft. Look, men, she actually cares what happens to the
		little girl."</p>
		<p>"You should care, too, Tanos,"
		she growled. "Anything happens to her and you will beg for death."</p>
		<p>Tanos maliciously tapped at the
		log which teetered, threatening to fall away. Gabrielle's eyes widened in fear
		though she kept silent and tried to maintain her calm looking confidently at the
		warrior.</p>
		<p>"Surrender now and I might let
		her live," he laughed.</p>
		<p>"You surrender and I might let
		you live."</p>
		<p>"You'll never reach her in
		time. But feel free to try. Men, take her!" Four large ruffians sprang into
		action, swords swinging. Keeping one eye on her friend, she met the attack
		intent on dispatching the thugs as quickly as possible. Parry, thrust, lunge,
		kick, slice, stab, and it was over as quickly as that, Xena standing above the
		fallen bodies. Gabrielle screamed as Tanos kicked the log out from under her.
		Xena grabbed her chakram to slice the rope. But before she could let it fly,
		Tanos, using an old trick of Xena's, blew alcohol-laden breath over a torch full
		into her face. The flames reached not only her skin, but also her eyes. She
		dropped to the earth, rolling to smother the fire as Tanos came forward, kicking
		her fiercely in the ribs. He kicked again, but she was ready and latched on to
		his foot twisting it sharply. He dropped to the ground in pain as the warrior
		princess climbed up his body to twist his neck sharply. Rewarded with the sounds
		of bones cracking, she released her hold attempting to get her bearings.
		</p>
		<p>The pain was almost unbearable
		as she attempted to open her eyes. <i>'That's not going to work. Ok, breathe
		deep, force the pain down. Now listen, damn you! You've got seconds to locate
		Gabrielle.'</i> She forced herself to stand perfectly still, straining her
		hearing as never before. Grass rustled, birds chirped, rabbits scurried to her
		right, and then the soft twisting of a rope to her left. She scrambled towards
		the sound, arms outstretched seeking. Running into the dangling legs of the
		bard, she wrapped her arm around the thighs, then swung up with her sword to
		sever the rope. Whack, miss, whack, miss. <i>'Stop swinging wild. Listen!'</i>
		Whack, and the bard's body fell over her shoulder. </p>
		<p>Gently she lowered her friend
		to the ground and yanked the rope from around her neck. The warrior felt no
		breath, so positioned herself to breathe for her friend. "Come on, Gabrielle,
		you can do it. Breathe for me," she said between giving her own breaths. Finally
		she heard the raspy intake of air. Xena could tell that breathing for the bard
		was not easy right now. Her neck had swollen from the abuse and was infringing
		on her windpipe. Placing her fingers lightly on her friend's eyelids, she'd know
		when she woke. "Open your eyes for me, Gabrielle, let me know you're all right.
		Come on, Gabrielle, you don't want to scare me do you?" She felt a flutter and
		let loose a sigh of relief. <i>'Thank the gods!'</i> "Good girl." Keeping her
		hand on her friend's cheek for both their assurance, she spoke, "Gabrielle, I
		don't want you to try talking just yet. Can you hear me?" She felt the slight
		affirmative nod under her hand. "Good. You lie still and I'm going to check for
		other injuries." She began at her head slowly feeling every inch of the bard.
		When she began to move down the arms, she was reminded that the small woman's
		hands were still bound. "I'm sorry, Gabrielle, I was so worried I completely
		forgot," she apologized as she turned her friend gently. Cutting the leather
		free, she continued her inspection. The warrior felt the bard's arm leave her
		searching hands and reach up to touch her closed eyes questioningly. "My eyes?
		Tanos caught me off guard with the fire breath bit." She felt her friend start
		to rise. "No. Stay still until I'm finished." The body relaxed beneath her.
		"Thank you." </p>
		<p>She resumed checking both arms,
		the shoulders, and down the chest. As her hands glided over the breasts, she
		sensed the bard tense. "Did I hurt you? Is there something wrong there?"
		Gabrielle took the warrior's hand and placed it on her own face, nodding
		negatively. Then she grabbed both hands and placed them on her midsection for
		her to continue. At first puzzled by the action, the warrior assumed that the
		intimate touch had made her uncomfortable. Once finished, Xena was happy that
		she had only come across small scrapes and scratches. She whistled for Argo and
		was soon rewarded with a muzzle pushing her hand. "Good girl." Pulling the
		saddlebags loose, she fished for the medicine pouch. Gently she applied salve to
		the cuts and scrapes as well as the bard's wrists. Finally she turned her
		attention to the neck. Applying plenty of salve to the rope burn, she completed
		with a soft clean cloth for protection. "We need to get to a stream so we can
		put cold compresses on your neck to bring the swelling down. Ready to get up?"
		The bard rose easily pulling the warrior after her. "I guess that's a yes. Let's
		get out of here," she smiled. Gabrielle touched the tall woman's eyes. "Yes,
		we'll take care of it, but not here." She felt a restrictive hand on her
		shoulder. "Gabrielle, we need cold water for both of us, so let's
		go."</p>
		<p>Less than a candlemark later
		they arrived at a glade with a wide flowing river. Xena refused to let Gabrielle
		tend her until cold compresses had been applied to the bard's neck. "We need to
		get the swelling down as quick as possible. You like breathing, don't you?" Once
		accomplished, the warrior instructed her friend on the herbs and ointments
		needed to make a poultice for her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Ready?" She felt two taps on
		her shoulder for yes. "Hand me the water skin then." The warrior braced herself.
		She'd lived through many injuries, but knew burns to the eyes were the most
		painful. Pouring water over her eyes, she attempted to open them.</p>
		<p>The bard looked on watching,
		noting the pain and noting Xena's failure to succeed. Placing her hand on the
		warrior's wrist, she stopped the process. Turning the hand over she traced
		letters in the open palm. "Let ? you ? try? Sure, why not? I'm not getting
		anywhere." Relinquishing the water skin, Xena sat back trying to relax. Gently
		Gabrielle placed her hand on the eyelid to pull it open, but the second she
		began, Xena's hand came up to bat hers away. </p>
		<p>"Sorry. Just instinct. Try
		again." She tried but was met with the same result. "Damn it, sorry." Again she
		tried, again the hand struck out. Xena could just imagine the bard with hands on
		her hips in exasperation. This time the bard took her hand, writing on it.
		"Won't ? hurt ? you ? trust. Gabrielle, I know you'd never hurt me and I do
		trust you. It's just ? I have a phobia when it comes to my eyes," she finished
		sheepishly. Again she felt the tracing in her palm. "Important ? must ? find ?
		way. Ok, well, you can always tie me down," she laughed. She heard her friend
		walk away towards Argo. "Gabrielle?" Then she was back and rope was being
		slipped over her wrist. "Hey!" she barked pulling away. "Trust" the bard traced.
		"Ok .. ok." The warrior placed her hands behind her back, tensing as she felt
		the rope begin to bind. But then she also felt Gabrielle's gentle hands stroking
		her arms in a reassuring gesture. </p>
		<p>It still took time to wash the
		eyes. Gabrielle could see the pain in her friend's face so she went slowly
		allowing her time to rest. When she was finished she patted the warrior's face
		which had grown pale. "Ok ? poultice time." The bard knew this would be harder.
		Before she began she pulled the warrior to her holding her head, stroking her
		hair. She could sense the tension leaving the woman's body. <i>Now it's time, my
		friend.</i> Tilting the tall woman's head up, she pulled the eyelid quickly and
		smeared the poultice liberally. As much as Xena tried to be still it was
		impossible and soon had pulled away breathing heavily. Again the bard held and
		stroked her until the pain subsided. Then just as quickly tended the other eye.
		Silent tears threatened to escape the bard's own eyes as she watched her
		friend's struggle. Putting swabs of clean linen over each eye, she wrapped them
		in place, kissing her friend's forehead when she was done. "Thank you. Now, you
		want to cut me free?" The warrior felt the drumming of the bard's fingers on her
		shoulder indicating she was thinking it over. "Not funny, Gabrielle." The bonds
		were quickly cut.</p>
		<p>As the bard released her friend
		she noticed in that short time she had pulled fiercely rubbing her wrists raw.
		"Sorry," she traced and immediately began applying ointment to the torn skin.
		"It's all right. The idea worked and you were right. It was important to do
		this. Lucky we won't have to repeat it for three or four days." Then she felt
		her friend rubbing aloe into the burns on her face. "Forgot about those. Thank
		you."</p>
		<p>She listened as her friend
		moved about obviously setting up camp. <i>'Great. It's my fault Tanos took her,
		my fault she got hurt, and now she has to do all the work. At least I can take
		care of Argo. That I can do blindfolded.'</i></p>
		<p>The bard watched the warrior
		carefully as she rose and made her way toward the mare. Seeing she was about to
		trip over a large stone, she clapped her hands once. Xena froze perplexed,
		"Something in front of me?" Two claps. "Thanks." Carefully she moved to one side
		giving whatever it was wide berth. She listened for Argo's grazing and continued
		on without incident. <i>'Damn, she must be watching me like I'm a little kid.
		This is embarrassing.'</i> Pushing the picture out of her mind, she reached for
		her horse, feeling for the cinch and pulling away the saddle. Then reaching into
		the saddlebags, she pulled out the currycomb and began brushing.</p>
		<p>Secure that the warrior was
		safe, Gabrielle returned to her chores. They had an early supper, Xena eating
		the cheese, bread, and jerky they carried with them and Gabrielle having to be
		content with broth since her throat was too swollen for anything else. After
		clean up the bard was rummaging through their bags and heading for the river.
		"Gabrielle? What are you doing?" she asked anxiously. In seconds the bard was by
		her side tracing, "Sorry. Bath."</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>The bard drew a question mark.
		"I can't see if you get in trouble and you can't call to me if you do. So no
		baths, no swimming, no out of range period for a while." She felt one sharp rap
		on her shoulder and the bard turning to leave. The warrior's reflexes were sharp
		as ever as she reached out grabbing her friend's arm. "Gabrielle, please. I'm
		not trying to be in charge. I'm just trying to keep you safe. I didn't do such a
		great job when I could see," she finished mumbling to herself.</p>
		<p>The bard looked at the guilt
		etched on her friend's face. Sitting next to her, she pressed their cheeks
		together as she traced, "no fault."</p>
		<p>"Right. You must get tired of
		me letting you down." She received a sharp slap on her thigh. "Oww!" And then
		tracing, "Can't ? control ? all. Well, I can try."</p>
		<p>She stroked the raven hair
		compassionately, then leapt up as an idea occurred to her. "Gabrielle, wait!"
		But she was already back at the warrior's side. Taking Xena's hand she placed it
		on her own wrist where a soft braided leather sash was tied. Trailing the
		woman's hand down the long length of the sash, the bard tied the end to the
		warrior's wrist. "What's this? A leash?" Two taps and then traced, "Now
		bath."</p>
		<p>"Ok, I give in." Gabrielle
		guided her friend to a log that rested partly in the river. Quickly she slipped
		off the improvised leash just long enough to wiggle out of her clothes before
		placing it back. With much enthusiasm she slipped into the water. It took a
		while for the two of them to get use to the tie between them. Twice the warrior
		began pulling the bard in; once when she got very still and once when she seemed
		to be jerking frantically. Finally the bath was over and the young woman
		emerged, mischievously shaking her wet hair over the warrior.</p>
		<p>"Hey!" She grabbed the leash
		with both hands and pulled her friend in before she could free herself. Tickling
		her fiercely she grinned, "Paybacks are a bitch, Gabrielle." But she froze as
		she realized the bard had grown stiff and her breathing was forced. "Oh gods,
		Gabrielle, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking." Holding her friend close she waited
		for her breathing to relax. "I'm so sorry. Really, I-"</p>
		<p>Her friend traced in reply, "No
		worry. Payback later."</p>
		<p>"Are you all right?" her face
		creased in worry. She felt her hand being brought to the bard's face that held a
		smile. Then she felt soft lips kiss her palm. There'd been more affection in the
		past few hours than the past two years. Xena didn't quite know how to handle it
		all. Brusquely she said, "Let's get you dry and dressed before you catch a
		chill."</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>The evening was dragging on.
		Usually the bard filled the night with stories, but tonight was still. Xena was
		restless having nothing to do. Gabrielle watched her friend's agitation and felt
		at a loss as to how to help. <i>'She needs to do something. But what's
		safe?'</i> Sidling up to her friend she patted her on the leg and the warrior
		automatically held out her palm. </p>
		<p>"Rub? Rub what?" Her hand was
		guided to the bard's shoulder. Immediately alert, she asked, "What's wrong? Is
		it hurting?" <i>'Hmmm. That's as good an excuse as any. Surely a white lie for
		the greater good is acceptable.'</i> She tapped twice. "Why didn't you say
		something sooner? Sorry, that didn't come out right. Come here." Methodically
		she began feeling each and every muscle, rotating the shoulder to see if
		something was amiss. <i>'Damn, all I wanted was a back rub. Didn't expect her to
		go into healer overdrive. Oh well ?' </i>"Maybe we need to put cold compresses
		on it." Tap no. "Ok, I just don't want to take any chances." The bard grabbed
		her hand, firmly placing it on her shoulder. "Ok, just rub. Got it."</p>
		<p><i>'Now this is nice. Wish I
		could get this every night.' </i>She leaned into the strong gentle hands and
		almost fell asleep under their touch. "Gabrielle? Sorry to bother you, but the
		fire feels low." The bard looked to see it almost out. How long had she been
		sitting there? Getting up she threw logs on bringing flames back to life. She
		looked up at the sky.<i> 'By the gods, she must have been at it at least two
		candlemarks.'</i></p>
		<p>"Sorry to make you do that."
		The younger woman looked at the grief behind the bandages. Walking back, she sat
		in front of her friend massaging her hands. "You don't have to do that." Tracing
		'want to.' "Well, thanks." She looked up into her friend's face. <i>'She does
		this every time I get hurt. Blames herself and sulks, then stops talking. But
		this is worse 'cause I can't talk her out of it. Maybe I can make her talk
		herself out of it. She should know the drill by now.'</i> One sharp
		slap.</p>
		<p>"Oww! Ok, that's a no, but no
		what?" She frowned and felt a tapping on her head. "No head?" Slap. "Oww! Stop
		that. No ? thinking?" Tap yes. "What are you talking about? Sorry." Slap! "Damn
		it, Gabrielle, you don't have to hit so hard to say no. Ok, what don't you want
		me thinking about?" The bard pulled her friend's hand to her neck. "About your
		neck? Oh .. about you getting hurt. What am I suppose to think about? This is my
		fault and I can't even see your face to know ?" she faded away.</p>
		<p><i>'To know? Something's up
		here. What is it, warrior?'</i> Trace 'know what?' "Nothing." The bard grabbed
		her friend's face pulling her around to look at her. Xena could feel her
		friend's piercing look even if she couldn't see it. She took a deep breath as
		she confessed, "When things go wrong, I look in your eyes and know it's all
		right. That you don't blame me ? that you still care ?"</p>
		<p>Suddenly she felt the bard's
		arms wrap firmly around her neck. Taken by surprise she just sat uncertain what
		to do. Pulling back she stroked the warrior's head trying to erase the furrows
		on her brow. With her other hand she pulled her friend's fingers to her own face
		encouraging her to feel the smile she held for her.</p>
		<p>"I'm being silly, aren't I?"
		Two taps. "Sorry." Slap. "Oww! Ok, I'm not sorry." She felt her friend nod
		emphatically. "It's late. We need to put another cold compress on your neck and
		try to get some sleep." Two taps and she got up to go to her bedroll.
		"Gabrielle? Would you mind sleeping next to me? I'd feel better knowing exactly
		where you are and ? well, not being able to see is not much fun."</p>
		<p><i>'Is she scared?' </i>The
		bard's head whipped around to stare at the warrior. <i>'By the gods, Xena
		<u>is</u> scared!'</i> She wrapped her arms firmly around the warrior kissing
		her on the cheek. Then she pulled her bedroll next to Xena's and helped her get
		settled.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Gabrielle slept lightly,
		expecting nightmares and they were right on time. <i>'This happens every time. I
		get hurt, she has nightmares. Better get ready.'</i> She moved the sword and
		chakram out of her friend's reach. <i>'Great, now what? I can't call to her to
		wake her. And getting too close can be dangerous.'</i> But she didn't have long
		to ponder the dilemma as the warrior's thrashing became more violent, her hands
		reaching for her eyes. <i>'Gods, no!' </i>The bard placed herself protectively
		over her friend's face as the hands scratched her back wildly. Placing her cheek
		against Xena's face, she tried to grab the hands and hold them down. Suddenly
		she found herself tumbling backwards as the warrior sat bolt upright, gasping
		for breath. As quickly as possible she crawled back to her friend, stroking her
		hair and face.</p>
		<p>"Gabrielle ? ?" Two taps.
		"Nightmare, huh?" Two taps. "Did I hurt you?" One tap. "I'm sorry ?" She felt
		her young friend's hands spell 'ok' and then continue to stroke her 'til she
		relaxed. Then she felt herself being pulled back down in the bedroll and her
		head firmly placed on the bard's breast as an arm slipped around her back to
		hold her tight. "Thank you." A kiss anointed the top of her head as the other
		hand continued to caress her face.</p>

		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>

		<p>Both woke early the next
		morning, each concerned with seeing to the other's needs. Gabrielle wanted to
		make sure no damage had been done to the eye bandages, Xena wanted to put cold
		compress on the neck. As she finished her hands slid down to the top of the
		bard's shoulders where she felt last evening's results.</p>
		<p>"I did hurt you."</p>
		<p>'Just scratch," she
		traced.</p>
		<p>"Let me feel. Come back here,"
		she said to her squirming friend. "Gods, you're covered with scratches! We
		should have put ointment on these last night. Damn it, Gabrielle, you can't do
		this! It's bad enough I can't see to take care of you properly, but if I can't
		trust you to tell me the truth then things will only get worse!"</p>
		<p>A hand went to her lips to
		silence her as the other traced, 'Sorry. I ? wrong.'</p>
		<p>"You don't want me smothering
		you, but what else can I do if you're not honest?"</p>
		<p>'Won't happen again,' she
		traced.</p>
		<p>"Promise?" An affirmative nod
		and two taps were her reply. "Ok then, let's take care of this." After the
		bard's back was tended, Xena moved to saddle Argo while Gabrielle packed their
		things. "I'm not sure it's wise being on the road just now in our conditions."
		Tracing 'want healer.' "I understand. It would probably be good to get to a
		healer to have him look at your neck." Slap! "Oww! I really hate the way you say
		no." Then she felt soft fingertips on her face. "You want a healer to look at my
		eyes." Very gentle two taps. "Now see? Yes is much nicer. Ok, a healer for both
		of us." Then a wicked grin crossed the warrior's face. "You realize you're going
		to have to ride, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Although Gabrielle was not fond
		of riding the big war-horse, she found sitting in front of Xena quite pleasant.
		The morning went by quickly, the stoic warrior taking a turn at playing
		bard.</p>
		<p>'<i>Now this is nice,' </i>the
		young woman thought as she leaned back into the warmth of the woman behind her.
		<i>'Xena tells a half-decent story. Maybe she's actually been paying attention
		to me. Except she does tend to loose focus. There she goes again just drifting
		off. I wonder why.' </i>The bard patted her friend's arm to continue and
		suddenly realized what else she'd been doing. <i>'By the gods, I've been
		caressing her arm without thought. Could I be the cause of her distraction? All
		right, let's try a little experiment.' </i>The bard kept very still, then, as
		her friend reached an exciting moment in the story, resumed her caresses. The
		warrior faltered and Gabrielle stopped. She repeated this little episode two
		more times, smiling happily with herself at its success. <i>'Oh, warrior, you're
		in for it now. I know your secret and I won't let it stay buried.'</i> Confident
		that she was not alone in her feelings, the bard began to make plans to draw her
		friend out.</p>
		<p>The young woman allowed her
		friend to finish the rest of her story uninterrupted. She could feel the woman
		let out a big sigh of relief. They rode in companionable silence for awhile
		until she felt the warrior begin to squirm. She glanced back at the stoic face
		frozen in thought. 'Wrong?' she traced.</p>
		<p>"Just thinking."</p>
		<p>The warrior felt two taps in
		understanding and then a hand at her mouth. <i>'Guess I'm suppose to talk.'</i>
		She tried to ignore the request but again felt the hand on her mouth more
		insistent this time. Taking a deep breath, she forged ahead, "I was wondering
		what to do if the blindness is permanent." She felt 'won't be' being traced in
		her palm. "Gabrielle, it's a possibility. I think the best thing would be for
		you to drop me off at Amphipolis with my mother and you could go on to the
		Amazons." She was met with the hardest 'no' to date. "Tartarus! I swear that's
		going to leave a bruise!"</p>
		<p>'Stay together,' the young
		woman traced.</p>
		<p>"I can't ask you to give up
		your life to take care of me." Slap no! "It's the best solution and you know
		it." This time Xena caught the hand before it gave the offending 'no!' "Got
		'cha!" Slap 'no' with the other hand. "Damn it. Look, my mind's made up and I
		don't want to talk about it any more." The silence became sullen and
		oppressive.</p>
		<p>A candlemark's worth of dust
		lay behind them when five men slipped into their path. The bard pulled Argo to a
		halt while inconspicuously placing her fingers on Xena's thigh to let her know
		how many and their approximate positions. Pulling out her staff, she slid to the
		ground before the warrior could stop her.</p>
		<p>"Our lucky day; a horse, some
		dinars, and a couple of women to share." Gabrielle went into her defensive
		stance. "Ok, little missy, put your stick down or I'll take your friend out."
		The bard smiled knowingly and shrugged. "Warned you," he spat as the dagger flew
		from his hand, only to be effortlessly caught by the warrior. Before he could
		move the dagger returned to its sender, insuring he'd never move
		again.</p>
		<p>"Damn you, bitch! Get her,
		boys!" yelled another of the men. Xena slid off Argo pulling her sword free
		while Gabrielle met the men midway. The robbers divided themselves between the
		women. Thinking the tall one easy prey because of her condition, they toyed with
		her laughing as they circled. Gabrielle was being much harder pressed by the two
		remaining men though their skills didn't meet her own. </p>
		<p>The warrior was in no mood to
		play and set about dispatching her foes as quickly as possible. "Hang on,
		Gabrielle! I'm coming!"</p>
		<p><i>'Still treating me like a
		child! I don't need you to save me, Xena!'</i> she thought as she brought one of
		the ruffians to his knees. <i>'But maybe <u>Xena</u> needs to know she
		<u>can</u> save me. Ok, my friend, this is for you.' </i>And the young Amazon
		lowered her guard, allowing the large clumsy man to get past her defenses. Xena
		heard a club make contact, knowing it was her bard who was taking the hit. With
		one last swing, her second man went down, and she turned to aid her friend.
		<i>'About time you got yourself over here. Ok, buddy, take one last swing so I
		can fall down. Ouch, that hurt, damn it.' </i>Gabrielle allowed the strike to
		throw her much more than it would have. She watched as Xena found her attacker
		and took him down faster than squashing a gnat. <i>'Knew you could do it. Now
		come and find me. I'm not going to make this easy on you, dear
		one.'</i></p>
		<p>"Gabrielle?" The warrior
		listened carefully. "Gabrielle, answer me. Please, gods, don't let it be bad."
		Again she listened and heard the soft breathing that led her straight to her
		friend. She felt wet stickiness as she touched the temple. "Damn. But it doesn't
		feel too bad. Gabrielle, come on, open your eyes."</p>
		<p><i>'Oh no, warrior, you're on
		your own,' </i>thought the bard as she continued playing possum. </p>
		<p>"Gabrielle, wake up! I know the
		wound's not deep. Maybe the hit was harder than I realize. Come on, Gabrielle, I
		need you to help me help you. Damn. Shaking her is not going to do any good. Get
		it together, warrior." She whistled for Argo who immediately came to her
		mistress's side. "Good girl. Down, Argo." As the horse knelt, she scooped her
		friend up into her arms and carefully slipped into the saddle. "Up, Argo. Now
		take us away from here, girl. Find us water, ok? And watch out for branches as
		you go." The horse snorted in reply and turned onto the road walking
		slowly.</p>
		<p>In less than half a candlemark,
		Argo turned from the road and started heading towards a stream not far away.
		Xena could smell the water and sighed in relief that her war-horse had come
		through for them both. "Down, Argo. Thanks, girl, you did great. Just let me
		take care of Gabrielle and I'll tend to you as soon as I can." Checking out the
		surrounding area slowly with her feet, she was soon satisfied that she wouldn't
		be putting the bard down on rough ground or in the middle of an anthill. "Come
		on, little one, don't you want to wake up?"</p><i>
		<p>'Not yet. You need a little
		more time.'</p></i>
		<p>The warrior rose and let Argo
		guide her to the water where she refilled the skins. Then gently she washed her
		friend's face and tried to slip a little water down her throat. "Gabrielle,
		you're starting to scare me. You shouldn't be out this long. Come on,
		please."</p>
		<p><i>'Gods, Xena, you sound so
		pathetic, you're making me feel guilty. Ok, I'm waking up, but I'm still not
		doing anything to help.'</i> Slowly she let her eyelids flutter open.</p>
		<p>"Gabrielle! Thank the gods! Are
		you all right?" She felt her friend nod. "You were out almost a full
		candlemark." She felt her hand patted in reassurance, then 'camp' was traced
		into her palm. "Yes, we're going to camp here. Argo picked it. Is it all right?"
		Two taps yes. "I'll get out the trail rations." She felt a pull on her arm.
		"What? Fish? Do you feel up to starting a fire?" She felt the bard use her arm
		for leverage to pull herself up, then felt as the small body collapsed against
		her. "Ok, that's enough. You just lie down and I'll take care of everything."
		Again a tug on her arm. "What? Cold? You're cold? Ok, I'll try to get a fire
		going." <i>'I can do this ? it just may take awhile.'</i></p>
		<p>With determination Xena
		searched for wood and by touch alone built a fire. "How's it look, Gabrielle?"
		Two claps were her answer. "Let's see if I can light this without setting the
		forest on fire," she laughed at herself. After a few strikes of the flint, a
		spark caught and the fire came to life. "Always said I could do it blindfolded.
		Guess I was right. Think I'll try for some fish now. Will you be all right by
		yourself?" Two claps. "Here, if you need me, just clang the plates together."
		Xena gathered herself, whistled for the mare, and together they went down to the
		stream. Carefully she waded into the water and waited patiently and was soon
		rewarded as a fish swam by. Expertly she hooked the fish by the gills and threw
		it to land. Emerging from the water, she soon recovered their supper and started
		back towards the campsite. </p>
		<p>"Hey, Gabrielle, look! I'm not
		sure what kind it is, but hopefully it'll be good." She was met with the sound
		of her friend applauding. With new life, the warrior turned to the task of
		cleaning the fish and cooking it. "Take a look. Is it done yet?" One clap. "Ok,
		a little longer." Soon the fish was ready and Xena proudly presented the meal to
		her friend. Happily the bard gobbled up the simple meal knowing the warrior
		would not be able to deny her ability now to care for them both.</p>
		<p>When dishes were cleaned and
		wood gathered, the warrior relaxed to pay full attention to her friend. "I don't
		feel any swelling or bumps on your head. You were out so long, I worry that I'm
		missing something." A gentle 'no' was tapped on her arm. "See? You can say no
		gently," she grinned.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle smiled at the tall
		woman who seemed relaxed and at peace for the first time since Tanos. She took
		her hand, tracing, "You brought me here. Took care of me. Fixed fire. Caught
		fish. You saved-" and then she pulled the large hand placing it on her rear with
		a mischievous smile. The warrior was surprised at the move and at the feel of
		the firm bottom in her hand. She chuckled nervously, a blush slowly creeping up
		her neck. Then the bard took Xena's right hand and placed it on her chest and
		her left hand on Xena's chest. A brow arched questioningly. She then brought
		both hands together, holding them firmly.</p>
		<p>"Together, you and me. I got
		it."</p>
		<p><i>'Not yet, but you will
		soon,'</i> she grinned at her companion. She turned and settled herself into the
		strong arms tracing 'sing.' "Ah, Gabrielle ?" A kiss landed lightly on her
		cheek. "Never could say no to you," she sighed and began a plaintive tune. Song
		after song came until the bard was fully in Morpheus's realm, snuggled close
		against her friend. The warrior soon followed content.</p>
		<p>In the stillness of the night,
		the dark woman woke to a hoarse familiar voice calling her name.
		"Gabrielle?"</p>
		<p>"Xena ? no ? don't ?. No,
		please ?"</p>
		<p>"Gabrielle?" She asked reaching
		for the bard's face. <i>'Talking in her sleep. That's a good sign. But what is
		she dreaming? It doesn't sound good.'</i> A last few unintelligible phrases
		slipped out before the bard settled back into a deep sleep, the dream over.
		<i>'Do I even want to know what that was about?'</i> Eventually her thoughts
		quieted enough to follow her friend into slumber.</p>
		<p>The next morning found the
		warrior back in the stream catching fish for their breakfast. Suddenly she heard
		the banging of plates and raced for her friend. "What's wrong?!" she asked as
		she felt for the bard's hands. <i>'Scared,'</i> was rapidly traced,
		<i>'Alone.'</i> "Gabrielle, I'm sorry. I just went to get us fresh food." The
		younger woman wrapped her arms around the warrior trembling. "Hey, it's all
		right." Big slap no. "I can't wait 'til you start talking again," she muttered
		under her breath. "You had a bad dream last night. Do you think that's why you
		were so frightened when you woke?" Two taps. "Want to tell me about it?" One
		tap. <i>'Then it was something bad about me.'</i> Gently she lifted her hands to
		the bard's neck. "Hey, good news. Swelling's almost gone. Bet you could talk if
		you wanted."</p>
		<p>Her hand went to her throat in
		surprise as she looked up at her friend. <i>'If I talk now there won't be any
		reason for our touching. And if I get well before her, she's only going to go
		putting up those walls again.'</i> Quickly she traced 'hurt.'</p>
		<p>"Still?" her friend asked with
		a twinge of apprehension and received two taps. "Best not to push it then. We'll
		just wait 'til we can see a healer. Let's go." She whistled for her mare,
		turning her attention to the horse.<i> 'She doesn't even want to try to talk.
		Probably doesn't want to have to talk to me.'</i></p><i>
		<p>'What just happened? Her mood
		went totally downhill.'</p></i>
		<p>As they moved on, Gabrielle
		tried to play and be affectionate with her friend, but Xena was stiff and
		detached. <i>'This is a fun ride. I've got to do something to pull her out of
		this.'</i> But try as she might, the warrior refused to be budged, and so the
		day went in silence. When they'd stopped for the night and finished their meal,
		the bard decided on the direct approach. Grabbing her friend's hand firmly, she
		traced a question.</p>
		<p>"Thinking."</p>
		<p><i>'Oh no, please! Not the one
		word answers! That's only one step away from monosyllabic grunts.' </i>'What's
		wrong?' she firmly traced and watched unbelieving as Xena pulled free. She took
		hold of the escaping hand. <i>'Talk to me!'</i></p>
		<p>"Why? You won't even try to
		talk to me," she said with a quiet desolation. The bard looked at her friend
		perplexed as she traced 'painful.' The warrior took a deep breath, "Gabrielle,
		you talked in your sleep last night. And I know your bad dream had to do with
		me."</p>
		<p><i>'Damn me and my big mouth!
		Now what?'</i> She was wracking her brain trying to come up with a way to fix
		the mess she'd inadvertently created. 'In dream, you left me,' she began.
		'Talked in sleep maybe why throat hurt now.'<i> 'Please let this satisfy
		her.</i> She stayed very still waiting for her friend's response.</p>
		<p>"Well ? I fell pretty foolish.
		Wasted all that good brooding for nothing I guess." Two taps. "I'm sorry,
		Gabrielle, I should have said something right away." Another two taps. "Forgive
		me?" Two very gentle taps. Then she leaned in and placed a light kiss on her
		friend's lips. It was received quietly as a kiss of friendship. But then, to the
		warrior's amazement, another anointed her filled with passion. Startled, Xena
		pulled back. "Gabrielle, what are you doing?" Her answer was another kiss more
		fiery than the last. Firmly she grabbed the smaller woman's shoulders and pulled
		her back, almost growling, "Gabrielle, explain."</p>
		<p>'You don't want?' she
		traced.</p>
		<p>"I don't want it out of
		gratitude. And certainly not out of pity." The warrior began to pull herself
		back protectively. A gentle hand caressed her face as the other traced, 'for
		love.' Confusion warred with desire on the strong face. "If only I could see
		your eyes to be sure," she barely whispered.</p>
		<p>'See with heart' was her reply
		punctuated by yet another kiss. For a moment the warrior was lost in the
		sweetness of those lips, but caught herself anxiously questioning, "Why
		now?"</p>
		<p>'No words to get in way. No
		looks to prevent me. These wounds, blessings. Let us touch unafraid. Let me see
		I love you.' The warrior sat motionless as the words were drawn in her palm.
		Gabrielle waited patiently.</p>
		<p>"Do you mean that?"</p>
		<p>The smaller woman brought the
		large hand up to her mouth, kissing the palm tenderly. Then she reached up to
		again take the luscious lips before her. As they parted, a smile played across
		the warrior's face. "I like the way you say 'yes.' Gabrielle, tell me, can you
		talk?"</p>
		<p>'Don't know. Haven't
		tried.'</p>
		<p>"Would you try for me
		now?"</p>
		<p>'I talk when you see ? my
		love.'</p>
		<p>"I'm seeing better all
		ready."</p>
		<p>And so the night was lost to
		the language of love beyond eyes and voice, the language of love that only the
		heart and body know. </p>
