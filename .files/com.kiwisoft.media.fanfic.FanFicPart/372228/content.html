<p><b>A/N: I know, there's really no excuse for it taking me this long to update, but this chapter seriously challenged me. Don't ask me why, but it did. I must've wrote and re-wrote it at least three times before I finally decided how I wanted it to be. There's some links to some things that happened back in some of the very early chapters too. Oh, and a certain song you may or may not recognize :) I hope you all like it :)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><u>CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">MEANT TO BE</p>
<p>Nineteen year old Miley Ray Stewart slowly sat up in her bed, stretching her arms toward the ceiling as she sighed contentedly. By the time she opened her eyes to greet the morning sunshine streaming in through the blinds on her bedroom window, she was already smiling. Today was going to be the greatest day of her life… because today she and Lilly were finally going to start the rest of their lives together, as woman and wife. Today, they were finally getting married.</p>
<p>Climbing out of bed, Miley walked over to her dresser and opened one of the drawers, where she pulled out a bra and a pair of panties. Softly singing a joyful tune to herself, she headed towards the shower. A familiar ringing suddenly caught her attention, and she paused to pick up her cell phone from the nightstand beside her bed. The smile already lighting up Miley's face grew even bigger when she realized she had a text message waiting for her from Lilly.</p>
<p><i>Morning beautiful! I love you! Your Lilly Bear</i></p>
<p>"I love you too," Miley whispered, grinning as she typed in her response. "You ready for today?" She took a few moments to set aside the outfit she had chosen to wear to the church, and a few moments later another message from Lilly announced its arrival.</p>
<p><i>You know it! What do you say we meet at that little church by your Mamaw's? I'll be the one all in white!</i></p>
<p>"Sounds good to me," Miley said with a laugh. "I can't wait until you're all mine…" After she typed in her response again, the brunette songstress walked into the bathroom and set her phone on the counter. She was just about to turn on the shower when yet another message announced itself.</p>
<p><i>I already am, Smiley… and I always will be</i></p>
<p>"Stop trying to make me cry," Miley whispered teasingly. "There'll be plenty of time for that later!" It was another few moments before Lilly answered again.</p>
<p><i>All right, but remember you asked for it!</i></p>
<p>"Stinker," Miley quipped, once again typing in her reply. "I don't wanna say goodbye, but I gotta go sweetheart; I need to get in the shower before Mamaw and Grandma Ruby get here." Lilly responded almost immediately.</p>
<p><i>You're gonna be naked and I don't get to be there? No fair!</i></p>
<p>Miley almost dropped her phone, and it was only by sheer luck – and quite a bit of juggling - that she prevented it from accidentally falling into the toilet. She could only imagine what Lilly's response would have been to her antics, had she been there, and Miley sagged to the ground, holding the phone against her chest as she was overcome with a fit uncontrollable giggling.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>After a quick breakfast downstairs, Miley and her family headed to the small church she and Lilly had chosen for their wedding. The Fourth Avenue Church of Christ was a small red and white building with a tall white steeple and simple wooden steps leading up to the main entrance. A pair of small rooms on either side of the church served as changing rooms for the two young brides as they prepared for the day they had been waiting for all their lives.</p>
<p>In one room, Mamaw Ruthie and Luanne helped Miley slip into her wedding dress, while Aunt Dolly did her hair and makeup. Miley had chosen a relatively simple white gown with spaghetti straps that flowed out from the pleated bodice, and she opted to wear only a little lipstick and, as Aunt Dolly put it, 'somethin' to color her cheeks'.</p>
<p>"Lilly likes me just the way I am," Miley insisted as she stared into the full-length mirror in front of her.</p>
<p>"I think she more than just likes you," Luanne said teasingly. Miley smiled shyly.</p>
<p>"I hope so, since she's about to become my wife," she said lightly. A wonderful shiver passed through her at the thought of finally getting to promise herself to Lilly forever. "Sweet niblets, I love saying that!"</p>
<p>"I can tell," Luanne quipped. "Only Lilly can make you smile quite like that…" Miley turned slightly, so she could look at Luanne over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Thanks for being here with me, Lu," she said softly.</p>
<p>"Thank <i>you</i> for giving me a second chance, Smiley," Luanne replied, her eyes sparkling with unshed tears. "I'm glad I get to be here to share your & Lilly's special day… it really means a lot to me that you trust me so much, after everything I did."</p>
<p>"Family forgives," Miley said warmly. Luanne responded by reaching around to hug Miley from behind, and for a long moment the two look-alike cousins just stared into the long mirror together, wearing matching grins.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>On the other side of the small church, in the other changing room, Lilly found herself fighting to stay calm. Despite her best efforts though, she fidgeted and squirmed as her mother tried to tie a simple satin bow in the back of her long blonde hair.</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake Lilly, sit still!" Heather Truscott teased her only daughter. "What's gotten into you?"</p>
<p>"Sorry mom," Lilly managed. "I guess I'm just a little nervous…"</p>
<p>"Every woman gets a little nervous on her wedding day, sweetheart," Heather replied with a smile. "It's perfectly normal."</p>
<p>"Why the heck am I nervous though?" Lilly exclaimed. "I'm about to marry the love of my life! What do I have to be nervous about?"</p>
<p>"Maybe you're not so much nervous as you are excited," Heather suggested with a grin. "Besides, you're about to promise yourself to someone for the rest of your life; think of it as nature's way of making sure you're doing the right thing." Lilly didn't reply; instead, she let her thoughts wander to Miley, and everything the amazing brunette had come to mean to her. From friends to best friends to girlfriends and eventually lovers, they had shared everything as they walked through life together, and Lilly honestly couldn't imagine anyone she would have rather taken the journey with. Slowly but surely, a loving smile lit up her face.</p>
<p>"I <i>know</i> I'm doing the right thing mom," Lilly whispered as she stared into the mirror in front of her. "I don't ever wanna be with anyone but Miley." Heather Truscott managed a watery smile.</p>
<p>"My little girl really has grown up…" she managed. She gently kissed Lilly on the cheek and hugged her warmly. "I know Miley feels the same way about you, too, honey."</p>
<p>"And you're gonna take her breath away when she sees you later!" Grandma Ruby spoke up, smiling warmly at the young woman she already considered her granddaughter. She and Miley & Lilly's friend Felicia were putting the finishing touches on Lilly's own stunning wedding dress. It was ivory colored with a lace bodice and delicate lace straps, and it flowed out around her like an elegant ball gown.</p>
<p>"Miley's not gonna able to wait to take you in her arms," Felicia added, wearing a grin of her own.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Felicia," Lilly replied, smiling and trying not to blush. "And you too, Grandma Ruby; I'm really glad you're both here today."</p>
<p>"And where else would I be when my granddaughters are getting married?" Ruby replied, arching an eyebrow. Her smile grew. "I'm real proud of the both of you."</p>
<p>"What she said," Felicia agreed. Lilly giggled.</p>
<p>"Thanks," she managed. She could tell Felicia was able to laugh as well, and the expression on her red-headed friend's face was enough to make her laugh again. Felicia couldn't help laughing as well, and soon she and Lilly were clutching each other as they laughed long and loud together.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Elsewhere, Robbie Ray Stewart – Miley's father - was facing a personal challenge of his own. The time had finally come to fulfill a promise he had made to his late wife years before… but he wasn't at all certain what was going to happen when did. The last thing he wanted was to tear open old wounds that had barely begun to heal, but there was no way he <i>wasn't</i> going to fulfill his wife's last wish. Taking a deep breath, he walked into the small changing room where his daughter was getting ready for her wedding.</p>
<p>"Hey bud," he called out softly. He watched her as she stood in front of the large mirror in her dressing room, grinning as her godmother helped her slip on her veil, and his heart ached painfully. She looked so much like her mother on their wedding day it was almost like Susan herself was standing there in front of him.</p>
<p>"Hi daddy," Miley greeted him, her eyes still focused on the mirror.</p>
<p>"Miles, you look…" Robbie Ray swallowed. "Baby girl, you look wonderful…" Something in the tone of his voice made Miley turn look at him, earning her a playful swat from her godmother.</p>
<p>"Miley honey, ya gotta stay still sweetpea!" Dolly teased her. She looked over at Robbie Ray as well. "And you're not helpin' any, father of the bride!"</p>
<p>"Sorry," Robbie Ray managed.</p>
<p>"Daddy, are you all right?" Miley asked him, her voice filled with concern.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Robbie Ray said carefully. "Guess I'm just tryin' to deal with one of those things no daddy is ever ready for… what his baby girl looks like in her wedding dress."</p>
<p>"Oh, Daddy…" Miley said hoarsely, her eyes already shining with tears. Robbie Ray walked over to her and they shared a long hug.</p>
<p>"Congratulations bud," Robbie Ray whispered. "I know you and Lilly are gonna be very happy." They parted after a long moment and Miley had to fight not to wipe her eyes.</p>
<p>"If we have to do her makeup all over again 'cause you made her cry, I'll tan your hide boy!" Mamaw Ruthie called out, wagging a mock-threatening finger at her son. Robbie Ray held up his hands in a gesture of surrender.</p>
<p>"Take it easy mom, I honestly wasn't plannin' on it," he replied. "I just wanted to congratulate my daughter… and to make good on a promise I made a long time ago." He reached into his tuxedo jacket and pulled out a simple envelope, slightly yellowed with age. Miley immediately recognized her name written on the front of it… and in whose handwriting.</p>
<p>"D-daddy?" she whispered, her voice already starting to shake. "Is… is that…?"</p>
<p>"It's from your momma," Robbie Ray said gently. "She wrote it for you before… well, before she left us… and she made me promise I'd give it to you on your wedding day." He paused.</p>
<p>"Now I know my life has been threatened if I ruin that pretty makeup of yours, and I swear I'm not here to upset you baby girl, but I never made a promise to your momma that I didn't keep, and I'm not startin' now." He carefully handed the envelope to Miley, who took it with trembling hands.</p>
<p>"You can read it whenever you're ready," Robbie Ray said softy, gently squeezing Miley's shoulders. "I know your momma wouldn't want to ruin your special day."</p>
<p>"No," Miley said as firmly as she could, though she didn't feel nearly as comfortable as she was trying to make herself sound. "If mom wanted me to have this today… then I'm gonna read it today." Very slowly and carefully, almost reverently, Miley opened the envelope and pulled out the simple piece of paper inside with trembling fingers. Swallowing, she gently opened it and began to read…</p>
<p><i>My Precious Miley,</i></p>
<p><i>If you're reading this, and your daddy did what I asked him to, then you're about to get married… and you don't know how sorry I am that I can't be with you on your special day. Remember I'll be lookin' down on you from Heaven, and that I'm very, very proud of you. I'll always be a part of you baby girl, and even if I can't be standing there beside you right now, know that my spirit always will be.</i></p>
<p><i>As you get ready to start your new life with the one you've chosen, I want you to remember one thing: make sure they know how special they are to get to spend the rest of their life with you, and remind them every day how much you love them. That's the most important thing, baby girl… love. Love can take you through anything. I know it took you through me having to leave you all so suddenly, and I know it'll be guiding you today.</i></p>
<p><i>Take care of yourself sweetheart, and always keep that beautiful smile of yours. The world needs the love and joy people like you can bring to it.</i></p>
<p><i>I know you and Lilly will have a wonderful life together… if ever two people deserved to spend their lives together, it's you two! Tell her I love her… and never forget how much I love you</i></p>
<p><i>Love Always,</i></p>
<p><i>Your Momma</i></p>
<p>"W-what…?" Miley gasped. She was shaking, and she felt light-headed. She turned to look at her father, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Daddy, I need to see Lilly!"</p>
<p>"Miley honey, it's bad luck to see each other before…" Mamaw Ruthie started to argue, but Miley cut her off.</p>
<p>"I don't care, I need to see Lilly <i>now</i>!" she wailed.</p>
<p>"I'll go get her," Luanne said softly, and she took off running. She returned a few minutes later with a worried-looking Lilly, absolutely radiant in her own wedding dress despite it all. The moment she saw Miley's tear-stained face, she rushed to her side.</p>
<p>"Miles, what is it? What's wrong?" she gasped. Miley gently pushed her mother's final letter into Lilly's hands, her eyes wide.</p>
<p>"Lilly, she knew!" Miley managed. "Somehow she <i>knew</i>!" Lilly didn't understand at all.</p>
<p>"Miley, what are you…?"</p>
<p>"Just read it!" Miley pleaded with her, more tears splashing down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Okay Miles, take it easy… I'll read it," she whispered gently. Taking one of Miley's hands in her own, she slowly read the letter Miley had given her. As she did so, her eyes went wide. She looked up at Miley again, tears sparkling in her eyes as well.</p>
<p>"Oh my God…" she whispered. She was utterly dumbstruck by what she had just read. Her throat tightened painfully.</p>
<p>"Daddy s-said she wrote it… j-just before…" Miley stopped, unable to continue. Lilly immediately put the letter down on the dressing table nearby and pulled Miley into her arm, whispering gentle and comforting words to the woman she loved. As she held the Miley in her arms, her thoughts began to drift back to a tearful conversation she remembered having with Miley's mother years ago, when the older woman was about to undergo the surgery that was supposed to save her life. Lilly could still remember the promise she had made to Susan Stewart that day, and she began to wonder if there could have been more to what Miley's mother had asked of her, so long ago. It didn't seem possible, and yet…</p>
<p>"Miley?" she called out softly. "Do you… do you remember when your mom was in the hospital, when they found out why she was so sick?"</p>
<p>"Yes…" Miley responded, her voice thick with emotion. Lilly closed her eyes.</p>
<p>"I never told you, but… she made me promise her something, just before they took her away," Lilly said softly. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Miley, she made me promise I'd take care of you… if anything ever happened to her…" She felt Miley gently pull away from her, and when their eyes met again, she could see the sorrow and disbelief on Miley's face.</p>
<p>"Don't you see, Miles?" Lilly whispered. "Even before you and I knew what we were really feeling, your mom knew about us… and she wanted us to be together."</p>
<p>"But how?" Miley managed. "How could she have known?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Lilly admitted, reaching up to gently wipe away Miley's tears. "But does it really matter? We're together… just like your mom wanted."</p>
<p>"And I know she's smilin' down on you two right now, happy that you two finally found each other," Grandma Ruby said warmly, from where she was standing beside the doorway.</p>
<p>"You guys are supposed to be together," Luanne added softly. "Anyone can see that."</p>
<p>"Even stubborn, short-sighted older brothers," Jackson agreed with a smile.</p>
<p>"I know for a fact that your momma is proud of <i>both</i> of you," Robbie Ray said gently, "because <i>I</i> sure am…"</p>
<p>"And anyone who thinks otherwise don't know what they're talkin' about," Mamaw Ruthie quipped.</p>
<p>Miley looked over at her family, and then back at Lilly. The expression on the secret pop star's face was somewhere between disbelieving, astonished and grateful, but nonetheless she managed a joyful smile through her tears, like brilliant sunshine emerging from behind dark clouds.</p>
<p>"God I love you…" she whispered to the blonde angel whose arms were still wrapped lovingly around her. Before Lilly could respond, Miley captured her lips in a tender kiss.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Miley," Lilly managed, when she could finally breathe again. "You're stuck with me forever…"</p>
<p>"Promise?" Miley asked in a soft, innocent voice.</p>
<p>"Speakin' of forever…" Aunt Dolly said gently. "I think there's a wedding that's supposed ta be startin' any minute now… that is, if you two are still of a mind to." She smiled, and Miley & Lilly couldn't help smiling as well.</p>
<p>"Try and stop us," Miley said lightly. "I really need to fix my makeup first though!" Lilly giggled.</p>
<p>"That makes two of us," she said. She turned to look at her future brother-in-law. "Jackson, do you think you can stall everyone for a few minutes? We'll be out there as soon as we can!" Jackson nodded.</p>
<p>"I'm on it, sis!" he called out as he hurried away.</p>
<p>"But don't do anything gross!" Miley added. Lilly looked at her with an amused expression on her face.</p>
<p>"Are we talking about the same Jackson?" she quipped. Miley took one look at her, and the two brides-to-be collapsed against each other as they shook with laughter.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Fifteen minutes later, the wedding ceremony officially began, and Miley found herself finally walking down the aisle, arm in arm with her proud father. As they slowly made their way towards the altar, where an angelic Lilly stood waiting for them, Miley wondered if all brides were as nervous as she suddenly felt.</p>
<p>She didn't understand why – after all, she was surrounded by her family and closest friends, and her best friend in the whole world was waiting to take her in her arms and love her forever – but somehow, she just couldn't stop her heart from thudding in her chest.</p>
<p>"You okay, bud?" Robbie Ray whispered to her.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, daddy," Miley whispered back. "I'm just bein' silly, I guess… but I know I can do this!"</p>
<p>"I know you can too," Robbie Ray replied, smiling proudly. "You've been ready since the day you two met." Miley looked at her father and smiled, tears already sparkling in her eyes. Finally, they reached the altar, and Miley's grinning Uncle Steven.</p>
<p>"Who gives my beautiful niece to be married?" he asked aloud, not bothering to conceal the pride in his own voice. Miley blushed politely.</p>
<p>"Her daddy does," Robbie Ray said softly. He turned and kissed Miley softly on the cheek, did the same to Lilly, and gently joined their hands together.</p>
<p>"Love you both," he said with a smile. Then he turned and took his seat in the closest pew, beside Heather Truscott.</p>
<p>"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of these two young people – Miley Ray Stewart and Lillian Danielle Truscott – in the bonds on holy matrimony," Father Steven began. "If there is anyone here who believes they should not be joined, let him speak now or forever hold his peace." No one spoke.</p>
<p>"Glad we got that out of the way," he whispered to Miley and Lilly with a grin. "You two have more important things to worry about!" The he spoke up again, his voice echoing across the small church.</p>
<p>"Do you, Miley Ray Stewart, take Lillian Danielle Truscott to be your lawfully wedded wife? To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and health, til death do you part?" Miley looked into Lilly's eyes and nodded, managing a watery smile.</p>
<p>"I do," she said softly.</p>
<p>"And do you, Lillian Danielle Truscott, take Miley Ray Stewart to be <i>your </i>lawfully wedded wife? To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and health, til death do you part?"</p>
<p>"I do," Lilly whispered, her eyes still locked with Miley's. Father Steven smiled.</p>
<p>"And what token do you give of the vows you have made?" he asked aloud. Miley and Lilly both turned to retrieve their rings from the two standing beside them. Jackson, standing beside his sister as her Best Man, smiled as he handed over the ring intended for Lilly and hugged her warmly.</p>
<p>"Now Miley, as you present the token of your vows to Lilly, please repeat after me," Father Steven said gently. Miley nodded and Lilly held out her trembling hand.</p>
<p>"With this ring, I thee wed…" Father Steven began.</p>
<p>"With this ring, I thee wed," Miley whispered to Lilly.</p>
<p>"…and pledge you my love, now and forever," Father Steven continued.</p>
<p>"…and pledge you my love, now and forever," Miley repeated. Then she gently slid the ring onto Lilly's finger, joyful tears trickling from the corners of her eyes. Grinning, Lilly turned to Felicia, her chosen Maid of Honor, and the smiling redhead carefully handed over the ring intended for Miley.</p>
<p>"Lilly, please repeat after me," Father Steven instructed her. Lilly nodded.</p>
<p>"With this ring, I thee wed…" he said.</p>
<p>"With this ring, I thee wed," Lilly said softly to Miley.</p>
<p>"…and pledge you my love, now and forever," Father Steven finished.</p>
<p>"…and pledge you my love, now and forever," Lilly whispered, her eyes finding Miley's again as she carefully slid her ring onto her best friend's finger.</p>
<p>"Now, I understand you have something else you'd like to present to your bride," Father Steven said gently to Lilly. Lilly looked at him and nodded, smiling gratefully. He returned the nod with a smile of his own. Miley, on the other hand, didn't understand what was happening at all.</p>
<p>"What's he talking about Lilly?" Miley whispered urgently to her.</p>
<p>"It's okay Miles, don't worry. I didn't tell you because I wanted it to be a surprise," Lilly replied. She looked over at her mother, and a teary-eyed Heather Truscott stood and handed her daughter what appeared to be a small yellowed piece of paper.</p>
<p>"L-Lilly?" Miley stammered. "W-what are you…?"</p>
<p>"Ten years ago, I met the most wonderful person in the world," Lilly said softly, "and she became my best friend… and so much more.' She held up the piece of paper.</p>
<p>"I've always kept this, to remind of how lucky I was… and still am… and how much you mean to me, Miley. For the first few weeks after we met, I wouldn't even let it out of my sight. Once… my mom even caught me sleeping with it." Lilly blushed slightly, but she still managed to smile.</p>
<p>"Now, I want <i>us</i> to keep it… together." Then, swallowing, she carefully opened up the piece of paper and handed it to Miley. The brunette songstress' jaw dropped open when saw it, and she instantly recognized it for what it was. There, written in the handwriting of a nine year old girl who hated math, were the words that had changed her life forever:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Miley – Will you be my friend?</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Yes</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>No</i></p>
<p>"You… you kept that… all these years?" Miley managed, her eyes sparkling with fresh tears. Lilly smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"You've always been close to my heart Miley, and you always will be… and I guess that's what this has always represented to me." Not trusting herself to speak, Miley pulled Lilly to her in a fierce hug. More than anything, she wanted to kiss Lilly with everything she had, but her Uncle Steven hadn't pronounced them married yet; so, for the moment, she let herself be contented with just a hug. From somewhere behind them, she could hear the sound of someone softly crying.</p>
<p>"Well, I think there's only one more thing we need to say after that," Father Steven said warmly. Miley and Lilly turned back towards him again, the small piece of paper held in their joined hands.</p>
<p>"By the power vested in me, by God and the great state of Tennessee, I now pronounce you wife and wife," Father Steven said gently. He grinned. "You may each kiss your bride…" Miley and Lilly wasted no time in doing so, wrapping their arms around each other as they kissed passionately. The sound of cheers and clapping – and at least one wolf whistle, probably from Jackson – echoed all around them. They parted after a few moments, whispering promises to each other of more later, and Father Steven raised his arms into the air.</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce you to Miss & Mrs. Miley & Lilly Truscott-Stewart!"</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>The reception took place at Mamaw Ruthie's, in her sprawling backyard. She lived close to the little church where Miley & Lilly were married, and it was literally the only place that could fit the entire Stewart clan. Despite some good-natured teasing from Ruthie about what she'd do if they <i>didn't</i> have it at her house, Miley & Lilly were only too happy to have their reception among all their friends and family.</p>
<p>The moment they walked in through the back door (no one actually used the front door at Mamaw's house), everyone crowded around Miley & Lilly to offer their congratulations and best wishes. Hugs, kisses and plenty of tears were freely shared.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much Uncle Steve!" Miley gushed as she hugged him.</p>
<p>"I'm honored you asked me, Miley," he replied with a smile. "It's not every day I get to perform a wedding ceremony for my only niece!" With his short brown hair and intense blue eyes, Steven Greene looked a great deal like his baby sister, especially when he smiled. In fact, Miley often liked to say the two of them shared the same smile.</p>
<p>"I'm not your only niece anymore," Miley reminded him with a warm smile of her own.</p>
<p>"My apologies… I guess I have two nieces now, don't I?" Steven replied, his smile growing. He stepped forward and hugged Miley & Lilly warmly.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the family, Lilly. You take good care of Miley now."</p>
<p>"That's one thing you don't have to worry about," a soft voice called out. Miley & Lilly looked up to see Heather Truscott walking towards them, a tearful smile on her face.</p>
<p>"I'm so proud of you two I can't tell you," Heather Truscott managed as she embraced her daughter and her new daughter-in-law. "Just promise me you won't make me a grandmother anytime soon!"</p>
<p>"<i>Mom!</i>" Lilly squeaked in embarrassment.</p>
<p>"What?" Heather asked innocently. "I never said I didn't want a grandchild at all, just not yet!"</p>
<p>"I'm sure they'll enjoy practicin' though!" Aunt Dolly added with a wink and a laugh. Heather laughed right along with her. Lilly groaned and buried her face in Miley's shoulder in an attempt to hide the blush creeping across her face.</p>
<p>"What is it with parents?" she whispered. "First you dad makes us cry, now my mom tries to embarrass us to death!"</p>
<p>"They just have a funny of way of saying they love us," Miley said with a grin. "Besides… Aunt Dolly's got a point." She winked, and Lilly felt her cheeks grow still warmer.</p>
<p>"I see cruelty runs in the family…" Lilly muttered. Miley giggled.</p>
<p>"You know I'm just teasing, silly," she whispered to her wife. "Come on, let's go find our table, I'm starving!"</p>
<p>"Food?" Lilly asked, peaking a single eye out from her hiding spot. The rich smell of roasting meat reached her nostrils, and Lilly felt her stomach growl hungrily. Neither she nor Miley had eaten anything since breakfast.</p>
<p>"Now you're talkin!" Lilly exclaimed excitedly, finally raising her head again. She found Miley's hand with her own and slid her fingers between Miley's. "Come on wife, let's eat!"</p>
<p>As they walked out into the backyard together, the two best friends gasped in unison. Everything had been decorated for their reception, and it looked absolutely incredible. What looked like white silk bows were hanging from most of the trees nearby, as well as each of the two dozen or so tables that had been set up. Night lights, the kind usually placed near a path or walkway, had also been set up everywhere, filling the yard with little white starbursts. A small wooden stage had been set up nearby as well, in the shade of a large group of trees, and Miley smiled. No Stewart family celebration would ever be complete without music.</p>
<p>In a large gazebo nearby, that Miley could remember playing in as a child, sat the amazing wedding feast was waiting. Most of Miley's family had worked together to prepare it all – grilled steaks, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, green salad, and enough biscuits for everyone in Franklin – and Lilly could feel her mouth already beginning to water. Then she saw a small chocolate fountain sitting on the smaller desert table, and her eyes lit up.</p>
<p>"Guess we know where you're gonna be for the rest of the night," Miley teased her.</p>
<p>"Like you're not gonna be standing there right beside me," Lilly quipped. "I know how much you like chocolate Miles!" Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"I guess someone else does too," she replied. In the very center of the yard, separated slightly from all the others, was a small table that had been set up especially for the two new brides. Unlike the other tables, with their centerpieces of daises and baby's breath, Miley & Lilly's table featured a single, large silver picture frame. Inside it was a picture that had been taken years ago, shortly after they first met. The radiant grins of two nine year old girls stared back at them as they carefully took their seats.</p>
<p>"I remember when this was taken, Miles," Lilly said softly.</p>
<p>"Me too," Miley replied, smiling again. "We were at the Harvest Fair, and your mom took a picture of us just after you won me that stuffed elephant…"</p>
<p>"She took a sneaky picture, without telling us," Lilly corrected her with a grin. "I can't believe she kept it all this time…"</p>
<p>"We thought you might like it," Luanne said softly as she walked up behind Miley & Lilly.</p>
<p>"Did you do all this, Lu?" Miley asked her carefully.</p>
<p>"Well, I helped," Luanne admitted with a shy smile.</p>
<p>"It's wonderful Lu, thank you," Miley smiled gratefully. Lilly's stomach chose that moment to once again announce it's presence.</p>
<p>"Sounds like your wife is hungry," Luanne said teasingly. "Tell me what you'd like, and I'll bring you some dinner from over in the gazebo."</p>
<p>"You don't have to do that, Lu," Miley said sweetly. "My wife and I can get our own food, really." She looked over at Lilly.</p>
<p>"Besides, that way you can get all you want," she promised. Lilly grinned.</p>
<p>"Well, what are we waiting for?" she asked eagerly. The two new brides quickly filled two plates for themselves, and Lilly wasted no time in eating as much as she could manage.</p>
<p>"You <i>do </i>know we're supposed to dance later, right?" Miley asked her with a grin. "And you're actually gonna have to <i>move</i>?"</p>
<p>"Like I'd miss my first dance with my new wife," Lilly replied with a grin. Her eyes sparkled as she called Miley her wife for the first time. "Trust me Miles, I'll be fine."</p>
<p>"Good," Miley said sweetly. Not far away, in the shade of a group of oak trees, the band – a group of Miley's cousins and uncles - was getting ready to play its first song. Not surprisingly, her ever-grinning Uncle Earl was a part of it… and so was her father.</p>
<p>"All right everyone!" Earl called out. "Before we get to the dancin', Miley's daddy has something he'd like to say!" He stepped aside to let his younger brother walk up onto the simple wooden stage.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Earl," Robbie Ray said quickly. "I know y'all can't wait to start the party, but I wanted to be the first to congratulate my two daughters." He eyes sought and found them, still sitting together at their own little table.</p>
<p>"Miley and Lilly, I know you're gonna have a long an' happy life together, and I couldn't be happier for the both of you. Now I wanna do something for you I haven't done in a long time… if I still can…" He held up a guitar Miley recognized and slipped the strap over his head.</p>
<p>"It's been a long time ya'll, so be kind," Robbie Ray said jokingly. "Girls, this one's for you…" Then, as Miley watched in amazement, her father strummed the guitar and began to sing…</p>
<p><i>You may think that I'm talkin' foolish</i></p>
<p><i>You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free</i></p>
<p><i>You may wonder how</i></p>
<p><i>I can promise you now</i></p>
<p><i>This love that I feel for you</i></p>
<p><i>Always will be</i></p>
<p><i>Well you're not just time that I'm killin'</i></p>
<p><i>I'm no longer one of those guys</i></p>
<p><i>As sure as I live</i></p>
<p><i>This love that I give</i></p>
<p><i>Is gonna be yours</i></p>
<p><i>Until the day that I die</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, baby</i></p>
<p><i>I'm gonna love you forever</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever, amen</i></p>
<p><i>As long as old men</i></p>
<p><i>Sit and talk about the weather</i></p>
<p><i>As long as old women</i></p>
<p><i>Sit and talk about old men</i></p>
<p><i>If you wonder how long I'll be faithful</i></p>
<p><i>I'll be happy to tell you again</i></p>
<p><i>I'm gonna love you</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever, amen…</i></p>
<p>"Wow…" Lilly whispered as she listened to her father-in-law sing. "You told me your dad used to sing, but I never thought…" She turned to look at her wife, and the expression on her wife's face nearly took her breath away.</p>
<p>"Miles, are you okay?" she whispered. Miley nodded slowly.</p>
<p>"Lilly, he hasn't sung like this... since I was a little girl…" the brunette songstress breathed. For what seemed like the thousandth time that day, she felt tears sting her eyes. This time though, it was followed by a smile.</p>
<p>"He's doing this for us," she managed. She turned to look at Lilly. "I wanna dance with you Lilly… I wanna dance with my wife for the very first time while my daddy's singing to us." The passion in Miley's voice nearly took Lilly's breath away, and she slowly held out her hand for her wife to take.</p>
<p>"I've never danced to this kind of music before, Miles," she said carefully.</p>
<p>"Just follow my lead," Miley said softly. Hand in hand, the two new brides walked out into the middle of the yard and began to dance together. Soon other couples began to join them, and even some of the children, all dancing a simple two-step together.</p>
<p>"You're doing fine," Miley whispered to her wife with a smile.</p>
<p>"Thanks to you," Lilly replied sweetly.</p>
<p><i>They say time takes it toll on the body</i></p>
<p><i>Makes a young girl's brown hair turn gray</i></p>
<p><i>Well honey, I don't care</i></p>
<p><i>I ain't in love with your hair</i></p>
<p><i>And if it all fell out</i></p>
<p><i>I'd love you anyway</i></p>
<p><i>They say time can play tricks on the memory</i></p>
<p><i>Make people forget things they knew</i></p>
<p><i>Well it's easy to see</i></p>
<p><i>It's happenin' to me</i></p>
<p><i>I've already forgotten</i></p>
<p><i>Every woman but you</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, darlin'</i></p>
<p><i>I'm gonna love you forever</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever, amen</i></p>
<p><i>As long as old men</i></p>
<p><i>Sit and talk about the weather</i></p>
<p><i>As long as old women</i></p>
<p><i>Sit and talk about old men</i></p>
<p><i>If you wonder how long I'll be faithful</i></p>
<p><i>Just listen to how this song ends</i></p>
<p><i>I'm gonna love you</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever, amen…</i></p>
<p>At some point, Miley began softly singing the words of the song to her wife, and their dancing began to slow down. Soon they were barely moving at all, their eyes locked together, as the world around them gradually faded away. For Lilly, there was nothing but the warmth of her wife's arms around her, and the wonderful sound of her voice as she continued to sing…</p>
<p><i>I'm gonna love you</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever</i></p>
<p><i>Forever and ever</i></p>
<p><i>Amen…</i></p>
<p>Finally the song ended, and Lilly leaned forward to capture Miley's lips in a tender kiss. They parted a few moments later, sharing a simultaneous smile that spoke more about the love they shared than any words possibly could.</p>
<p>"I love you," Lilly whispered.</p>
<p>"I love you more," Miley whispered back. Lilly laughed softly and hugged the woman she loved tightly. The sound of the Stewart clan cheering long and loud for Robbie Ray brought them back to reality, and, hand in hand, Miley and Lilly jumped up on stage. They both hugged Robbie Ray tightly.</p>
<p>"That was amazing, daddy!" Miley gushed.</p>
<p>"I never knew you could sing like that, Mr. S," Lilly added with a grin. "Now I know where Miley gets it!"</p>
<p>"Well thanks," Robbie Ray answered with a smile. "I just felt like bringin' out Ol'Betsy for one last song." He gently slipped the guitar strap over his head and set the instrument carefully aside.</p>
<p>"As far as I'm concerned daddy, you can play anytime," Miley said warmly. Robbie Ray laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll keep that in mind. Right now, I think I'd rather dance with my daughter on her wedding day." Grinning, Miley led her father off the stage. Lilly gave a little wave and returned to their table so she could watch.</p>
<p>"All right everybody!" Uncle Earl shouted. "It's time for the father n' daughter dance! Evr'body else, please clear out!"</p>
<p>"He coulda said that a little nicer," Miley laughed. Robbie Ray just smiled.</p>
<p>"He means well," he said lightly.</p>
<p>"And now, for a special song jus' for Miley and her daddy… picked out 'specially by the bride herself!" Uncle Earl called out. A few moments later, the chosen song – "Daddy's Hands" by Holly Dunn – began to play softly in the background, and Miley and her father slowly began to dance.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about earlier," Robbie Ray said carefully. "I didn't mean for your momma's letter to upset you so much." Miley sighed.</p>
<p>"It's all right, daddy," she replied. "I don't even know why I got so upset. I guess I just couldn't believe she already knew about me and Lilly."</p>
<p>"You know she always loved you both," Robbie Ray said softly. He smiled. "And so do I." Miley grinned and gently rested her head on her father's shoulder as they continued to dance.</p>
<p>"I love you too, daddy," she said softly. "Thank you so much for everything today… especially the song. That was really special."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you liked it, bud," Robbie Ray said. "I guess the old man's still got it, huh?" Miley gently kissed her father's shoulder.</p>
<p>"You never lost it, daddy."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't lie to your father," Robbie Ray said dryly, and Miley laughed. When the lyrics of the song spoke of how 'daddy's hands were hard as steel when I done wrong', Miley looked at her father with a shy smile.</p>
<p>"Boy were they," she said lightly.</p>
<p>"Oh come on, I was never <i>that</i> bad," Robbie Ray protested.</p>
<p>"No," Miley admitted with a grin, "but you don't ever wanna get on Robbie Ray Stewart's bad side either!" She paused for a moment, staring into the eyes of the man who had raised her and her brother – whose love & strength never faltered, even through his own grief & pain from losing the woman they all loved – and then she leaned forward and gently kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p>"Thank you, daddy… for everything. I love you so much," she whispered as she hugged him.</p>
<p>"It's been my pleasure, bud… and it always will be. I'll always be here for you if you need me."</p>
<p>"Trust me, I'll always need a daddy," Miley promised him with a smile. The song slowly ended, and Miley and her father at last stopped dancing, but they remained close, Miley still holding her father's hand.</p>
<p>"You guys looked so cute," Lilly quipped as she walked up behind her new wife and father-in-law. Miley smiled, her face lighting up as she watched her wife approach, and she pulled Lilly into her arms for a hug.</p>
<p>"Would it be all right if I danced with my other daughter?" Robbie Ray asked carefully. "After all, I have two daughters now, don't I owe 'em <i>both</i> a father-daughter dance?" He smiled warmly and Lilly blushed.</p>
<p>"I never really had a dad before," she admitted. "I'm glad I have one now, and that it's you, Mr. S." She returned his smile with one of her own.</p>
<p>"I mean… dad," she corrected herself softly. As Miley watched with tears in her eyes, her father gently took Lilly in his arms and they began to dance. From somewhere behind her, the flash of a camera suddenly went off. Turning, Miley saw Aunt Dolly standing there with a grin on her face.</p>
<p>"Figured you'd want a picture of that," the older woman said.</p>
<p>"I already know exactly where I'm gonna put it too," Miley said with a grin of her own as she walked over and hugged her godmother.</p>
<p>"By the way, you've got a visitor," Aunt Dolly told her.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Miley asked, wondering who could possibly be coming to see her that wasn't already at the reception.</p>
<p>"I think he said his name was Lebeck," Dolly said after a moment.</p>
<p>"Oh, that must be Mr. Lebeck from the record company," Miley explained. "He produced my first album as Hannah. Heck, Hannah wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for him."</p>
<p>"Well, he's waitin' for you in the livin' room," Dolly replied with a smile. Miley nodded and followed her godmother back into the house. As she expected, she found Mr. Lebeck standing in the living room, staring at a large family portrait taken at a family reunion a few years back.</p>
<p>"Hi Mr. Lebeck," Miley called out to him. "It's nice to see you again." He turned to look at her and smiled.</p>
<p>"Miley, you look beautiful," he said warmly. He hugged her briefly and she returned the quick embrace. "Congratulations on your wedding, by the way; I know you and Lilly will be very happy." Miley grinned.</p>
<p>"Thanks Mr. Lebeck," she responded.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the ceremony, but I brought a couple of gifts I hope will make up for it a little," Mr. Lebeck continued.</p>
<p>"You didn't have to do that, Mr. Lebeck, really," Miley protested. "You've done so much for me already."</p>
<p>"Well, I hope you'll let me do just a little more," Mr. Lebeck insisted. He reached into his jacket and pulled out two envelopes. He handed the first to Miley.</p>
<p>"Your first concert tour was outstanding Miley," he continued. "Sales of your album are through the roof. Everyone's talking about Hannah Montana… including our board of directors." His smile grew.</p>
<p>"So much so in fact, we'd like to offer you a full three year, three album recording contract… for three million dollars." Miley's eyes went wide, and her jaw dropped open.</p>
<p>"Are you… are you serious?" she managed. Mr. Lebeck nodded.</p>
<p>"Absolutely," he replied. "You're an incredibly talented young woman, Miley."</p>
<p>"I could still work directly with you?" Miley asked him carefully. Again he nodded.</p>
<p>"I'd still be your producer," he promised. "You wouldn't have to deal with anyone else but me." Miley blinked.</p>
<p>"I think I need to sit down…" Miley quipped. Mr. Lebeck laughed softly.</p>
<p>"You don't have to answer right now, of course," he assured Miley warmly, amused at the expression on Miley's face. "In the meantime, we'd also like to give you and your wife something." He handed her the other envelope.</p>
<p>"Think of this one as our wedding gift to you and Lilly," Mr. Lebeck explained, smiling again. "It's an all-expenses paid trip for your honeymoon… to Rome."</p>
