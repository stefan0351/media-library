<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ A Wake-Up Call -->

<p>Early morning. Xena and Gabrielle are sleeping peacefully; their campfire has burned down almost to ashes. Xena still has a fading black eye - from Gabrielle conking her on the nose a couple of days ago.</p>
		<p>Five thugs attack, yelling. Xena wakes up. Gabrielle sleeps on oblivious.</p>
		<p>Xena reaches for the nearest weapon available and grabs ... their new frying pan. She grimaces, puts it down and reaches for something else. "Gabrielle, wake up," she yells, before turning to fight. </p>
		<p>Xena successfully uses: stones surrounding the firepit, ash, the contents of a waterskin, Argo's feedbag, fallen branches, windfalls from a pear tree .... She's enjoying the adrenaline rush, laughing and encouraging the thugs before blinding them or braining them ... then she notices that Gabrielle <i>still</i> hasn't woken up and 2 thugs are approaching the bard.</p>
		<p>Xena flips up onto a tree branch and bounces up and down vigorously on it. A ripe pear plops down on Gabrielle's chest waking her. She blinks, realizes she is about to be attacked by 2 thugs, and springs up grabbing her staff. Now both women are fighting. </p>
		<p>Gabrielle has her staff taken from her and Xena is concerned. She finishes off her own attacker then looks round for something to use to aid Gabrielle from a distance. She grabs a green garment from Gabrielle's pack, tears off a sleeve, then grabs a stone and uses the sleeve as a slingshot to fling it. It knocks out the man about to run Gabrielle through.</p>
		<p>That's the last man standing, so the fight is over. Xena turns to the nearest still breathing thug and puts the pinch on him.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle comes over to join her, notices the green garment now minus its sleeve. "My best nighty, Xena! It's ruined."</p>
		<p>A distracted Xena looks up. "Is it?" She stands up, grabs the nighty, looks at it judiciously, then simply tears off the other sleeve. "There, good as new."</p>
		<p>"It is <i>not</i> good as new. It's only fit for using as a duster now. Why couldn't you use something else? You knew Lila made this for me. "</p>
		<p>"Gabrielle! I was a bit pressed for time. I would have used the frying pan, only, after last time ..." </p>
		<p>"Why do you always <i>do</i> this, Xena? What's wrong with using your sword and chakram?"</p>
		<p>Xena opens her mouth to speak.</p>
		<p>"And don't mention your juices," yells Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Xena closes her mouth with a snap.</p>
		<p>"Hey," says the thug urgently. "Blood to the brain, yadda yadda. I'm running out of time here!"</p>
		<p>"Sorry!" Xena returns her attention to him. "So, who sent you?"</p>
		<p>"Loxius."</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>"To take you out. He thinks you might try to stop him."</p>
		<p>"Stop him from doing what?" asks Xena.</p>
		<p>"I don't know."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle butts in: "Where is Loxius now?"</p>
		<p>Xena nods approvingly. "See - you do ask good questions." To the thug: "Yes, where is he?"</p>
		<p>"Aucuba. He's taken over the village. Forced the blacksmiths to make weapons instead of farm implements."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle turns to her and says knowingly: "Looks like we're going to Aucuba then."</p>
		<p>Xena nods. "Looks like."</p>
		<p>"Hey," yells the thug.</p>
		<p>An apologetic Xena looks down at him. "Sorry." She yawns. "I'm not at my best first thing." She releases the pinch then knocks him out.</p>
