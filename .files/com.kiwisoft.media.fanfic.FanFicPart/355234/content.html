<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Holding Pattern -->

<p>Brooke lay curled up asleep on Sam?s chest as they lay on the couch.  It was the first safe sound sleep she?d had in weeks and Sam was more than happy to play body pillow for her.  The lines of stress and worry were mostly gone from Brooke?s face, Sam noticed as she slowly caressed the blonde?s cheek and stroked her hair.  Kelly walked in and covered the duo in a blanket, sharing a look with Sam.</p>
<p>"I?m glad to see she finally fell asleep," Kelly commented as she sat down in the armchair nearby.  Sam nodded.</p>
<p> "She needs the rest," she remarked.  Kelly eyed Sam critically.</p>
<p>"Quite a mess you two are caught up in," she said shortly.  Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"I love her," Sam said softly as she looked at the peacefully slumbering girl in her arms.  Brooke smiled in her sleep and snuggled closer, pressing her nose into Sam?s neck.  Kelly watched the display with a frown.</p>
<p>"But is it enough, Sam?" she asked. "I mean, look at all the pain and hurt that it?s caused, to everyone.  Look at the Hell poor Brooke has been through recently because of it.  How can you sit there and tell me that your love is worth all of that?"</p>
<p>Sam looked back up at Kelly, tears falling slowly from her soulful brown eyes.</p>
<p>"It is," she whispered unable to say more.</p>
<p>"Kelly," Terri said, her voice holding a warning tone as she entered the room. "Give poor Sam a break.  What she and Brooke have is solid and real.  It?s also something you don?t understand and have no right to judge."</p>
<p>"I?m not judging," Kelly said defensively. "I?m just concerned about my daughter?s welfare."</p>
<p>"Yeah, right!" Terri scoffed. Her eyes turned cold as she regarded her sister.  "You weren?t so ?concerned? when you left her with that monster when she was 9." Kelly paled and looked away.</p>
<p>"I knew he?d never harm her," she said softly. "If I had doubted that, even for a second, Tia, I would have left her with Mom and Dad, not Mike."</p>
<p>"Well, he DID hurt her," Terri sneered. "Emotionally, mentally, AND physically." Sam was quietly tracing the spot where Brooke had confessed Mike had hit her.  Tears still fell silently down her face as the two grown blondes argued around her.</p>
<p>"And I got her away from him as soon as I heard, Tia," Kelly pointed out using Terri?s childhood nickname. "And we reported his ass.  He can?t hurt any of us ever again."</p>
<p>After Kelly and Sam had picked up Brooke and returned to Sam?s house, Brooke had retreated to Sam?s room and refused to come out for two days.  Finally late one night, she?d broken down and told Sam about everything that Mike had said and done to her and how scared she was.  Sam was enraged that Mike had hit her but remained calm for Brooke.  She also convinced Brooke to go to the police the following day.  Mike was arrested on a host of charges ranging from abuse to risk of injury to a minor, unjust imprisonment, and threatening.  There were several restraining orders against him so despite the fact that he?s posted bond, he could go no where near any of them.  When Brooke had gone to retrieve her things at the Palace, several burly and mean looking police officers had protectively stood guard over her.  She truly was, for the moment, free.</p>
<p>"That may be true now, Kel, but the damage is already done," Terri hissed protectively.  "How could you leave her with him in the first place?"</p>
<p>"Please stop," Sam begged quietly but went unheard.  Kelly flinched at her sister?s question as if struck.</p>
<p>"I was young and scared, Tia," she responded. "But I knew for all his rage, he?d never harm Brooke.  Hell, he never WOULD have if Sam?"</p>
<p>"Sam?  You?re going to blame poor Sam for this mess?" Terri asked aghast, her eyebrows hitting the top of her forehead.  "God, Kel, leave it to you to blame someone else for your mistakes.  Sam has done EVERYTHING on God?s green earth to help protect Brooke and keep her safe.  Even if it meant getting herself hurt.  Don?t stand there and give me any bullshit about this being Sam?s fault."</p>
<p>"Terri!  Kelly!  Stop it!" Jane commanded as she was drawn into the room by the raised voices.  She looked at the desperate lost and hurt look on her daughter?s face and felt her heart break.  Sam and Brooke looked so fragile lying there on the couch.  Brooke, somehow, was still sound asleep but Sam was obviously being torn to emotional shreds.</p>
<p>"These two girls have been through enough without your bickering adding to it," Jane added.  Both blondes looked suitably chastised.</p>
<p>"She?s lost weight," Terri said sadly looking at Brooke.  Sam kissed the top of Brooke?s head.</p>
<p>"Stress," Sam said simply. "We?ll put it back on her."</p>
<p>"Maybe I should take her with me to San Francisco for awhile.  Just until things blow over," Kelly suggested.  Panic and outright terror flashed across Sam?s face.  She wrapped her arms tighter around the sleeping form in her arms.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, Kelly," Terri sighed, rubbing the bridge of her nose with her fingers. "That?s your answer to everything; run.  You can?t keep doing that forever and you can?t take Brooke with you."</p>
<p>"I just think some distance and a chance to clear her head would do her some good," Kelly argued.</p>
<p>"You?re not taking her anywhere," Sam said quietly but with a firm strength.  The three adults turned their attention to the young brunette.</p>
<p>"I let Mike take her because I had no choice and it damn near destroyed us both," she continued, her voice trembling with emotion. "And he hurt her, something I will never forgive him for or myself for letting happen."</p>
<p>"Sam, it?s not your fault," Jane interrupted.  Sam silenced her with a look.</p>
<p>"It?s also not my point," Sam said flatly. "My point is, I let go of her once and it hurt us both.  No one, NOTHING is taking her from me again." She stared pointedly at Kelly.</p>
<p>"Do you understand me?"  After a few moments, Kelly reluctantly nodded.</p>
<p>"I only want what?s best for my daughter, Sam," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"You need to see, Kelly, that what?s best for me is Sammy," Brooke?s voice rang out clearly surprising everyone.  She lifted her head slightly and kissed Sam lightly on the lips.</p>
<p>"You?re voice woke me," she smiled at Sam, answering her lovers unasked question.  Sam smiled warmly back.  Brooke then turned her attention back to her biological mother.</p>
<p>"Kelly, I appreciate that you got me away from Mike and are willing to help me stay away from him.  But you need to accept that I love Sam, no holds barred.  I don?t know if it?s the gender thing that?s got you all hung up or what.  I know, I should have called or visited and told you that I was gay.  This isn?t the way you should have found out."</p>
<p>"It isn?t that, really, Brooke," Kelly shook her head.  Brooke frowned at her.</p>
<p>"Then what is it?"</p>
<p>"I know you think that this thing is real between you but you?re both so young.  How can you be so sure?" Kelly asked, doubt and disdain coloring her voice.</p>
<p>"Oh for crying out loud!" Terri exclaimed throwing her hands up and storming out of the room. "You?re a lost cause, Kelly!" she shouted behind her.</p>
<p>"Mom," Brooke said evenly looking Kelly in the eyes. "I am sure.  WE are sure.  I?m pretty damn sure I?ve loved Sam from the first day I laid eyes on her.  Through this whole damn mess, the one thing that has kept me going is the thought of Sam.  My love for her and the love I know she has for me.  It?s kept me sane, alive.  I have never really been alone because I know that even when she?s not physically by my side, Sam is with me.  I?m sorry if you can?t understand or comprehend the depth of what I feel, what I hope she feels but, it IS real; it IS lasting and it IS all I need." She finished with a long sigh and settled back into Sam?s arms.</p>
<p>"It IS how I feel," Sam whispered to her.  Kelly pondered her daughter?s words.</p>
<p>"Pretty flowery words, Brooke.  I only hope they?re enough because things aren?t going to be easy." Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"They never are."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"OK, I think that?s the last box," Nicole declared as the movers set down the last heavy Tupperware container.  "Thanks guys," she said as she handed out generous tips.  The crew smiled and told Nicole and Lily that anytime they needed help moving to call.  It wasn?t every day that they were paid so well or treated to homemade lunch and lemonade.</p>
<p>"Good Lord," Sam said melodramatically. "How can two people have so much sh?"</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke said lowly in warning but with a small smirk.</p>
<p>"Stuff?" Sam corrected herself hastily as she looked around. "I was going to say ?stuff.?" All the furniture was in place and boxed were in the right rooms.  All that was left to do was unpack them.</p>
<p>"Gee, Sam, two teenage girls, one of whom is a Julian," Lily laughed. "It shouldn?t be that much of a shock."</p>
<p>"True," Sam conceded. "And moving all of Brooke?s stuff out of the Palace was a chore too.  How you guys can accumulate so much?STUFF?is beyond me."</p>
<p>"Says the pack-rat poster girl," Nicole snorted. "Remember, Spam, I lived with you.  I know all your little hoarding secrets." Sam acted horrified and then stuck her tongue out at her tormentor.  She then turned her attention to her own blonde love.</p>
<p>A shadow had passed over Brooke?s face at the reminder of having left her childhood home.  Sam understood her pain and wrapped her arms around her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"It?ll be all right.  I promise," she vowed in a whisper into Brooke?s ear.  Brooke sighed and relaxed into Sam?s arms.  Sam always made her feel safe, comforted, loved.  She believed the things Sam told her.  She knew Sam would find a way to keep her promise.</p>
<p>"You OK, Brooke?" Nicole asked, seeing the downcast look on Brooke?s face.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking about how much our lives have changed," Brooke said honestly.  "I mean, if you were to compare who we are now with who we were about a year ago, I think you?d have very different individuals." She disengaged herself from Sam?s arms and sat down, still talking almost to herself and heedless of who was listening.</p>
<p>"It?s like we were all lined up in a row like dominos, close but not quite touching.  Then Lily went in to talk to Sam and confessed how she felt.  And it could have stopped right there.  No one else would have known; no other pieces would have been disturbed.  But, for whatever reason, I wanted to know if Sam wanted a ride home that day.  I stood in the door and listened to Lily?s confession and in turn, Sam?s.  And the reaction started.  Lily was like the head domino that started the whole chain reaction."</p>
<p>"Great, make me feel guilty," Lily complained quietly.  Nicole shushed her.</p>
<p>"Let her talk, she needs to get this out of her system," the petite blonde advised.</p>
<p>"So, like, Lily fell into Sam, Sam fell into me," Brooke continued still in her own bubble. "And our falling took down Nicole.  Then we just seemed to be able to watch the pattern spread.  We sucked all the other pieces down with us.  Our parents, our friends, our families.  It completely changed the environment we live in."</p>
<p>She fell silent, staring at the floor.  Sam walked over and kneeled down in front of her.</p>
<p>"That?s what love does, Brooke.  It changes you," she said softly, lifting Brooke?s chin with her fingertips. "It makes you grow and become stronger.  And yes, it spreads to those around you.  The circle grows.  And maybe you lose some people along the way but you gain some too.  You lost your Dad, and I?m sorry about that, but your aunt is back in your life.  And now your mother is around too.  Maybe not in a ?super supportive? sense right now, but she?s there, Brooke.  That?s more than you had before."</p>
<p>"And look at us, Brooke," Lily added, indicating herself and Nicole. "We have our own home, a house." Triscuit yowled pitifully from around her feet and Lily laughed as she picked her up.  "And we have Triscuit," she giggled.</p>
<p>"Let?s not forget the furball," Nicole rolled her eyes.  Triscuit hissed slightly at Nicole who hissed back.  The cat then hid in Lily?s arms.  </p>
<p>"My point is," Lily broke in. "Stop that Niki," she said as Nicole stalked the kitten in her arms. "My point is no one is where they were, Brooke.  But we?re all better off.  It?s all in how you look at it and if you sit there and only focus on the bad, you?ll miss the good."</p>
<p>"She?s right, Brooke," Nicole agreed as she scooped the protesting kitten from Lily?s arms and looked at it intently.  Triscuit took a playful swipe at Nicole?s nose.</p>
<p>"I don?t think she likes you," Sam laughed.  Lily shook her head.</p>
<p>"Actually, that silly thing follows her around the house, sleeps at her feet and talks back at her.  It?s only when Nicole tries to pet her that Triscuit gets frisky," she explained.</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"I can?t help hearing what my mom said, about it being worth it, Sammy," Brooke spoke up again, drawing Sam?s attention back to her.  </p>
<p>"What do you mean, hon?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"I mean, well, it IS worth it, Sammy.  I don?t doubt that.  But why does it have to be so hard?  Why do we have to fight so much?" her voice was small and childlike, confusion carrying through clearly as well as hurt and not a small bit of anger. "It?s not fair."</p>
<p>"No, it?s not.  The road so far has been unfair and rough, Brooke.  But I love you and I?d go through whatever it takes to make sure you know that.  Mike, Kelly, my own mother, nothing would be able to stop me.  And eventually, Brooke, it will get easier."</p>
<p>"I love you, Sammy.  I?m just so tired," Brooke leaned her head against Sam?s shoulder.  Sam ran her hands through Brooke?s hair.</p>
<p>"I know, baby, I know," Sam whispered.</p>
<p>"Sam, why don?t you take her upstairs to one of the spare bedrooms for a nap?" Lily suggested quietly.  Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I think I will.  Thanks." Sam helped Brooke to her feet and guided her towards the stairs.</p>
<p>"One of us will come get you for dinner, OK?" Nicole asked.  Sam smiled at her.</p>
<p>"That?d be great," she said. "Come on, Brooke.  Let?s go lay down." Brooke mumbled her agreement and the duo disappeared up the stairs.</p>
<p>"Damn I want to kick Mike in the balls for what he?s done to her," Nicole seethed after they were out of sight.  Triscuit had settled on her shoulder and was watching Lily.  Lily stroked the side of Nicole?s face.</p>
<p>"I know.  I want him to pay for everything he?s done too, Niki.  But that?s not what?s important right now.  Brooke?s hurting and helping her though that is what we need to concentrate on.  Sam is going to need our help to get Brooke over this whole thing.  And then through Mike?s trial and everything.  It?s going to get worse before it gets any better." </p>
<p>"I know," Nicole sighed. "But I can at least make sure that Brooke and Sam have the best lawyer money can buy," she suggested.  Lily smiled.</p>
<p>"That?s one way you can help.  But remember money doesn?t solve every problem.  We need to be there if Sam and Brooke need us," Lily reminded her.  </p>
<p>"We will be," Nicole vowed.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"I?m sorry if I ruined your day," Brooke apologized around a yawn as Sam pulled the covers up around them.  She snuggled against the blonde.</p>
<p>"You didn?t," she assured her.  Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam, feeling as though the brunette was her security blanket.</p>
<p>"We weren?t much help to Nicole and Lily.  We?re supposed to be helping them move in," Brooke pointed out.</p>
<p>"They understand, Brooke.  That?s why they?re our friends.  Besides, I?m sure there will be plenty of boxes left for us later," Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"I?m just so tired, Sammy.  I just want to sleep," she explained quietly.</p>
<p>"Then go ahead, Brooke," Sam encouraged. "You?ve been through a lot.  You?ve been stressed to the maximum and now that has been lifted from you.  You?re safe now and your body is reacting to that.  This is normal.  And I understand, love.  So rest as much as you need to, I?ll be right here." Brooke leaned over and kissed her understanding lover deeply, hoping to convey her love, gratitude and relief to Sam through the kiss.  Sam returned the kiss and wiped away the few stray tears that had slipped down Brooke?s face.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Brooke, sleep," she whispered.  Brooke hugged her even tighter and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy.  I love you."</p>
<p>"Love you too."</p>
