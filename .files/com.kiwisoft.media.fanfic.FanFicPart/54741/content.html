<P>"I will <I>not</I> allow you to put yourself in danger, Lieutenant." Seven’s  voice increased in volume as she paced the floor angrily in the Briefing  Room.</P>
<P>Captain Janeway glanced at Seven’s agitated movement before turning to gaze  steadily at B’Elanna. "I’m not sure I can allow it either", she told her Chief  Engineer.</P>
<P>Instead of exploding, B’Elanna leant back in her chair and sighed though  inwardly she was seething. She and Seven had approached the captain after the  senior staff briefing to explain their project. Janeway’s interest had been  piqued by the ingenuity and the sheer science of it all and had briefly yearned  to return to her science officer origins. B’Elanna waited till the end to reveal  how she could beat the nanoprobe problem. In order to program the bio-neural  circuitry quickly enough, B’Elanna proposed to connect herself directly with the  circuitry controlling the gel-packs using a bio- neural link. Seconds would be  shaved off the installation of the circuitry and any challenges the nanoprobes  attempted could be combated as they happened rather than as a reaction to their  effects. After running a series of simulations last night, B’Elanna was  confident she could do the procedure. However, a direct link to bio-neural  circuitry was against Federation law and held inherent dangers.</p>
<P>"Using a link to combat potentially aggressive nanoprobes could be suicidal."  Seven broke her stride to argue. "I am grateful for your assistance in this  project but there must be another way to proceed with the programming", she  insisted and looked imploringly at the Captain, hands clasped behind her back in  a familiar pose.</P>
<P>"Before you both write this suggestion off, would you please allow me to work  with the Doctor and see if we can make the link safer? He may be able to  assist", proposed B’Elanna calmly, privately thanking Tuvok for all the  meditation lessons. Even if she was fighting turmoil within, she could at least  now project a slightly calmer aura. Her comment and the manner in which she  expressed herself stunned both the Captain and Seven. Janeway looked at the  klingon hybrid and made another evaluation. She so desperately wanted Seven to  be able to experience complete humanity but that was never going to happen  unless a drastic course of action was undertaken.</p>
<P>The Captain paused for a moment, picking her words carefully. "If you and the  Doctor can work out a safer way to do this then you have my support", she  offered and held up a hand to silence the outburst from Seven before it even  started. "Whether Seven chooses to accept the procedure is up to her." The  Captain looked at Seven intently and waited. B’Elanna refused to look at the ex-  drone, not wanting to intimidate her into an answer.</P>
<P>Seven was confused about the whole issue. She wasn’t sure that achieving  complete humanity was worth the risk to B’Elanna. She was uncertain as to when  her feelings toward the Chief Engineer had changed from superior indifference to  genuine affection but she knew with absolute certainty that those feelings were  totally authentic and not just a temporary emotion brought on by the proximity  they had shared whilst working on her project. She did not want to do anything  to jeopardise B’Elanna’s safety. She also realised that, had the tables been  turned, she would be the first to offer her services to help her friend  regardless of risk, and Seven did not like the idea of being a hypocrite. "I  will only consider this if the Doctor agrees to the procedure", she stated, her  tone indicating that this was strictly non-negotiable.</p>
<P>It was enough for B’Elanna and she sprang from her chair, a look of happy  determination etched across her features. "Captain, would it be acceptable to  work on this now? I have Vorik in charge of Engineering. Naturally, if our  current situation changes I’ll head straight back there." She paused to draw  breath and the Captain took the opportunity to interject quickly.</P>
<P>"If you’d approached me earlier, you wouldn’t have had to spend all last week  working into the early hours", she admonished gently. "As it is, I see no  problem in releasing you to this full time, on the provisos you’ve already  expressed obviously." Janeway allowed herself to smile at the woman’s enthusiasm  as B’Elanna hastened from the Briefing Room. "I’m glad you and B’Elanna have  overcome your differences", she confided in the young ex drone.</p>
<P>Seven smiled shyly. "So am I Captain", she agreed readily. Seven seemed about  to say something more but changed her mind. "Captain, if I am not required in  Astrometrics, I would like to assist B’Elanna".</p>
<P>Janeway nodded and Seven turned briskly, barely pausing for the doors to  slide open before leaving. The Captain returned to her chair for a moment and  took a deep draught from her coffee cup that had been neglected during the  meeting. She grimaced as the bitter liquid touched her lips. It had gone cold  but she swallowed the dark beverage down quickly and appeased her craving. She  studied one of her data padd reports for a moment before her mind drifted back a  few minutes. Janeway did not know how the ex- borg would react to the release of  all her emotions. She had a dread feeling that it would be a bumpy ride for the  young woman and the rest of the crew as she adjusted. At the same time, if the  cortical inhibitor could not be removed, it might affect Seven just as deeply.  Seven needed her friendship and guidance more than ever yet she had not confided  in her at all. Janeway felt an illogical stab of jealousy directed at her Chief  of Engineering and shoved it back to the recess of her mind hurriedly. If the  ship’s grapevine was correct, Seven was dating Tom Paris. Janeway wasn’t sure  that was wise either but she was confident that there would be no future in it.  Once Seven had her first relationship out of the way, Janeway would slowly  reveal her interest and finally show Seven the love she so truly deserved.  Janeway was alarmed as her libido soared at that final thought. She gulped down  the last dregs from her black and silver cup before returning the receptacle to  the replicator. Fortunately the strong taste of cold coffee had the desired  effect and she entered the Bridge fully focused on the day-to-day running of  Voyager.</P>

<P>For the next few hours the EMH joined B’Elanna and Seven on the holodeck to  examine their proposal carefully. Once he got to grips with the concept, he was  keen to assist in any way he could, though he felt somewhat aggrieved that Seven  had chosen to pursue a different way of getting round the inhibitor without  consulting him. He understood the principle of linking B’Elanna up to the  bio-neural circuitry but had serious doubts that it could ever be totally safe.</p>
<P>"Mr Paris’ involvement with ‘Alice’ should give you warning enough to not try  and do this B’Elanna", he cautioned.</p>
<P>"I remember Doc, I was there", the petite engineer reminded him. "But the  information we gained from that may help us come up with a buffer for me, or at  least some sort of safety net so that the risk to me isn’t unacceptable". She  pulled a face as she spoke the last words, causing Seven to break out into a  wide grin and release the tension that had been building between them ever since  B’Elanna had first approached the Captain. Her brown eyes sparkled as she  returned the smile good-naturedly and there was a tacit understanding between  the two women that things were back to normal. The Doctor coughed to regain  their attention.</p>
<P>"So how do you propose to put a buffer between the circuitry and your brain  without slowing down data transference?" he asked, getting to the crux of the  matter.</p>
<P>"Well that’s where you come in, Doc", the engineer informed him, her dark  brown eyes sparkling as she tossed yet another data padd towards him. The Doctor  frowned darkly but scrutinised the padd carefully. Seven ran her fingers  gracefully over her workstation and viewed the same information that the Doctor  had been given by the Chief Engineer. She lifted her enhanced eyebrow in  surprise at the information on the padd and stared at B’Elanna intently.</p>
<P>"I would never have made this sort of <I>inspirational</I> leap between  theories. I believe your staff and I have underestimated your abilities", she  stated sincerely.</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt herself blush at the compliment so quickly brushed it off  defensively. "It was just a hunch, Seven. I just tend to get lucky with them".  She looked away as she saw Seven still studying her.</p>
<P>"Thank you, B’Elanna", she stated simply, her voice barely audible, as she  realised just how much effort and time B’Elanna had put in.</p>
<P>"We’re not there yet, remember?" she reminded the beautiful ex drone gently.  "I’m not allowed to do this if we don’t get the odds down". Seven bobbed her  head in agreement and began punching up more data. B’Elanna turned to her own  console, her heart pounding furiously. She’d spent more time with Seven in the  last week than she had for years and yet she still couldn’t tell her how she  really felt about her. So much for facing up to her feelings, she thought  bitterly, clenching her fists reflexively to manage the anger that she directed  inward. The dark engineer then chastised herself for once again forgetting  Seven’s involvement with Tom. Her feelings would have to remain hidden. Slowly,  she uncurled her fingers, using the action to release the tension her fury had  built up inside her and enabling her to direct her energies more profitably  towards the task at hand.</P>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<P>B’Elanna sat at a workstation in the sickbay resting her chin on the backs of  her hands as her elbows were propped on its edge. She and the Doctor had moved  there when Seven excused herself to have dinner with Tom. The young blonde had  felt guilty in leaving him last night and thought it would be a good idea to  spend some time with him this evening. She had wanted B’Elanna to join her but  felt it would be insensitive to ask her to share dinner with an ex-lover and his  new girlfriend. The EMH had suggested it instead, not realising his faux pas  until he was skewered by one of B’Elanna’s fiercest stares. Once Seven had  departed, B’Elanna had suggested moving to the Doctor’s ‘home environment’, so  to speak, and continuing. Unfortunately, they were now at deadlock.</P>
<P>She fixed the Emergency Medical Hologram with a stare so hard he convinced  himself that he felt uncomfortable. "It doesn’t matter how you look at me  Lieutenant, the figures can’t be changed", he told her definitively, though  there was a hint of nervousness about him that the klingon couldn’t fail to  detect.</P>
<P>She sighed deeply, almost growling, before speaking. "Shall we look at this  from a medical point of view as opposed to a technical one then?" she  suggested.</P>
<P>The Doctor appeared to take umbrage at this suggestion. "I have already  researched the matter and given Seven her options as far as medical surgery is  concerned. She chose not to take me up on <I>my </I>idea", he replied somewhat  haughtily.</p>
<P>B’Elanna closed her eyes for a long moment and the Doctor had the distinct  impression she was counting to ten. When she opened them again she pinned the  EMH with another stare. "Well how about you look at how you can adapt <I>my
</I>idea?" she asked. "I would have thought you wouldn’t care who suggested what  as long as she gets a chance to fulfil her humanity", she added pointedly, her  humourless smile chilling the words further.</p>
<P>The Doctor, suitably chastised, sniffed unnecessarily before bringing up some  more data on one of the larger screens. "Perhaps I need to look at this from a  different perspective", he suggested to himself and began to make some rapid  calculations. B’Elanna smiled at his back, accepting his unspoken apology before  returning to her own console.</p>
<P>Four hours later, they sat across from each other and smiled. They hadn’t  eliminated the risk, but by using the Doctor’s holographic matrix the feedback  from the bio-neural circuitry could be contained and the borg nanoprobes would  be slowed down too – an added bonus. The only snag was that the EMH would have  to be off line during the procedure and therefore unable to monitor either Seven  or B’Elanna. As soon as it was over and his matrix purged however, he could be  restored to assess the success or failure of B’Elanna’s work.</P>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<P>Seven lay in Tom’s arms listening to the soft sounds of his breathing as she  contemplated. For the second time in two days she wondered what love was really  all about and if the inhibitor removal was really necessary. Tom seemed to enjoy  himself when they had sex. Seven failed to see its attraction however, except as  a physical gratification for others. She certainly had no similar sense of  enjoyment in the way Tom had. Perhaps that would change if B’Elanna succeeded.</p>
<P>The tall blonde sighed heavily. There was a bittersweet irony to all this.  Seven had never felt so close to anyone as she had to the half-klingon. She had  been able to anticipate her actions and needs when they had been working today  and Seven had felt an exhilarated thrill as they worked together. Once it was  over though, they would return to their normal jobs and not have the opportunity  to work so closely again and the ex- drone resented that. Willing the project to  fail, however, was not an option. She had come so close now. To share real depth  of emotion would make her complete and perhaps begin to eradicate the feelings  of isolation and loneliness she had harboured for so long. Even now she felt  alone and wanted nothing more than to be back with B’Elanna but Seven decided  that it would be inappropriate to leave Tom for two nights running, so instead,  she relaxed her body as best she could and tried to sleep.</P>
<P>The next morning Seven was summoned to the Captain’s Ready Room. She arrived  promptly and discovered that the Doctor and B’Elanna had already joined the  Captain, B’Elanna sipping at what smelt like a hot chocolate whilst Janeway,  naturally, was savouring a hot coffee.</P>
<P>There was no preamble about the meeting. The Doctor took the lead in  explaining how they could reduce the risk to B’Elanna before going over some  final nuances that he and B’Elanna had tackled late into the night.</P>
<P>Seven at first felt guilty for not being as involved as she could have been,  but then realised that she could not undo her actions. She was still dubious  about the potential risk to the Chief Engineer though.</P>
<P>"This has less risk involved than most of my Engineering repairs", B’Elanna  explained gently. "I’m prepared to take the risk and, as long as the Captain is  prepared, I can’t see how you can continue to object".</P>
<P>"I do not wish to be the cause of any harm to you, B’Elanna", Seven  responded, almost snapping out the reply.</p>
<P>Janeway noticed how Seven used the engineer’s first name again and felt a  familiar pang of jealousy, wondering how it was that Seven and B’Elanna were on  first name terms all of a sudden. She admonished herself once more, remembering  that the two women had been working closely on a very personal project for over  two weeks now. It was only logical that the barriers would eventually  lessen.</P>
<P>"It really is up to you now Seven." Janeway advised her. "It’s your choice if  you want to go through with the procedure." The Captain took another draught  from her cup, looking at Seven carefully, unwilling to put any pressure on her  beautiful protégé. Unexpectedly, Seven sat down and stared at her companions in  the room. The young ex- drone could feel the conflict in her yet she felt under  a tremendous burden that she ought to be able to resolve. Confusion flashed  through her eyes as she tried to reason out her anxieties and hesitancy.</p>
<P>Sensing Seven’s inner turmoil and wanting to give her some room to manoeuvre,  B’Elanna spoke up. "Seven, you don’t have to make your decision right away. To  be honest, I’m in no fit state to do it today and I’m sure the Doc wants to run  a few checks with you before we go ahead. Why don’t you take some time to think  about it?" she offered, earning a sharp look of reproval from the Captain.</P>
<P>"Yes", Janeway concurred smoothly. "Take the day off and consider your  options. If you want to talk about any of this you know where I am", she  continued smoothly, putting the chain of command firmly back where it  belonged.</P>
<P>Seven’s eyes darted between the two women, searching their faces for some  hidden clue on how to deal with her predicament. She stood once more as she came  to a decision. "You are correct. I need time to assimilate all my feelings on  this matter. I will return later when I have an informed and logical choice."  With that, the tall blonde nodded briefly at the other occupants in the room  before stalking out, her eyes unfocused as she searched her feelings.</P>
<P>"Dismissed", said the Captain softly, with a wry expression as the borg left.  She turned her attention to the Doctor and B’Elanna. "Make your preparations  both of you. Get some rest too B’Elanna. I’ve given you the day off. Just make  sure to catch up on your sleep. I have a feeling tomorrow will be a big day for  all of us." With a nod, she dismissed the bald hologram and shorter, slight  engineer. As the doors closed Janeway could still feel her heart hammering  inside her chest and she dwelt on her feelings for Seven a while longer, feeling  closer to her already.</P>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<P>Feeling out of sorts and unsure of how to proceed, Seven sought comfort  through familiarity. She spent time with the Borg children, ensuring that they  had plenty of study to do, as well as time to play, as children should. When she  was satisfied that they had been dealt with properly, she made her way to  Astrometrics, in order to perform a series of routine diagnostics and made  several minor adjustments to the instruments. The young woman realised that she  was employing delaying tactics in order to avoid the conflict she felt but was  not ready to think about them seriously yet.</P>
<P>When she exhausted her supply of test routines, Seven found herself wanting  to express her concerns but was uncertain who to speak to. She remembered the  Captain’s offer but for some inexplicable reason, felt uncomfortable exposing  her weaknesses to the Captain. Tom would not be suitable either as he would use  the time to try and comfort her instead of really listening or understanding how  she felt. Oddly enough, Seven felt herself drawn to speak with B’Elanna Torres,  so she asked the computer for the engineer’s location.</P>
<P>"Lieutenant Torres is on Holodeck One", came the bland reply. Seven was  surprised. After the brief this morning, she didn’t think that there was  anything further to be done until she was ready to go ahead with the procedure.  Viewing this as one of her last opportunities to work closely with B’Elanna,  Seven strode towards the holodeck to offer her assistance.</P>
<P>She realised her assumption was incorrect as she stepped through the doors of  the holodeck and found her heels sinking into soft white sand. Her skin  registered the change in atmosphere from the temperate, sterile corridor to a  hot, humid climate and she squinted her eyes as her pupils painfully  constricted, trying to block out the bright sunlight from her delicate retinas.  There was a saline smell hanging in the air and her auditory nerves registered  the gentle rhythmic beat of surf breaking on the shoreline. Her attention was  caught by a shout emanating from the sea. She turned and focused on a dark head  bobbing in the azure water and watched unabashed as B’Elanna stood and emerged  from the ocean.</p>
<P>For a moment Seven thought that she might be malfunctioning, for her mouth  had turned arid, her heart hammered furiously somewhere near her throat and her  insides turned to liquid as she watched the lithe, dark woman run toward her.  She was wearing a lime green one-piece swimsuit that Seven recognised as being  functional, yet it accentuated the dark woman’s figure and tan perfectly.</P>
<P>She struggled to gain her composure as B’Elanna stood in front of her, her  chest heaving from the exertion of both the swim and run.</P>
<P>"I didn’t know you were a fan of the beach", B’Elanna stated breathlessly as  she used strong hands to slick her dark hair over her head, wringing out  rivulets of seawater that ran chaotically over the curves of her body from the  thick tresses.</P>
<P>Seven found that she had to swallow several times in order to get her vocal  chords working. "I am not. I thought that you were working on the project still  and came to offer my assistance."</P>
<P>B’Elanna smiled, wondering why the ex- drone appeared so flustered, noticing  the slight flush to her alabaster skin and the racing pulse, clearly visible at  the side of her porcelain neck. "Nah, I’m just enjoying some time off. This is  one of my favourite places. I can wear myself out swimming and then relax and  soak up the warmth in the sun without a soul to disturb me", she explained.</P>
<P>"Then I shall leave you in peace", Seven replied and turned her shoulders to  go. She was stopped by a gentle hand on her upper arm.</p>
<P>"There’s plenty of room to share, Seven", B’Elanna offered. "Besides, I like  your company", she smiled again as Seven noticed how the saline content of the  water had crystallised over the klingon’s exposed skin, sparkling as the bright  sun reflected off its microscopic fascias.</p>
<P>B’Elanna didn’t wait for an answer as she led Seven towards a shaded area of  the beach. Within the umbra of the trees, a large blanket was spread neatly with  a small pile of clothes on one corner. B’Elanna threw herself onto one side of  the blanket and stretched out languidly, putting her hands behind her head to  use as a pillow and closing her eyes as she felt the warm breeze caress her  body.</P>
<P>"Sit down and relax, Seven", she told the tall blonde who had remained  standing, transfixed by the raven-haired beauty. B’Elanna felt the ground move  slightly as she heard Seven sit and opened one eye to squint at her companion.  She fought to hide a grin as she saw Seven sitting crossed-legged next to her,  back ramrod straight. "You can relax if you want to. No one else can see you",  she mocked lightly.</P>
<P>"I do not feel like relaxing", was the hesitant reply. B’Elanna rolled over  onto her side and cradled her head on one hand. "You want to talk about it?" she  offered gently, watching the young woman stiffen slightly as she warred within  herself.</p>
<P>Seven looked closely at B’Elanna and then began to speak. She confided all  her inner dreads and fears concerning the removal of the cortical inhibitor,  from the bombardment of her emotions to the possibility of B’Elanna getting  injured during the process. She expressed her fears for the borg children and  how they would react if she changed drastically and how her relationship with  the members of the crew could potentially alter. She even articulated her  feelings for Tom Paris and how uncertain she was about her relationship with  him.</P>
<P>Throughout this elucidation B’Elanna remained silent, watching Seven  attentively and listening carefully. She had thought that Seven might have had a  few reservations but she hadn’t realised that up till now, Seven had remained  reticent to everyone.</P>
<P>Finally, Seven ran out of words and looked miserably at the woman lying next  to her, smiling wanly.</P>
<P>"You must think I am weak", she remarked self-depreciatingly.</P>
<P>B’Elanna sat up hurriedly and looked intently at her, noticing how the  difference in their height became less marked when seated. "Not at all, Seven.  Just the opposite, in fact. To admit your most personal feelings to someone is  one of the bravest things you can do. By voicing them, you’ve already admitted  them to yourself."</P>
<P>B’Elanna put her hand over Seven’s and squeezed it gently. "Just remember  that this is for you. If you don’t want to go through with it or you want more  time say so. No one will get offended."</p>
<P>Seven’s hand felt like it was on fire as it reacted to B’Elanna’s touch. The  blonde woman gloried in the sensation for a brief second before responding to  B’Elanna’s words.</P>
<P>"Thank you for listening to me. I feel I can make a more informed decision  now". With that, Seven gently returned the pressure from B’Elanna’s hand before  standing in one fluid movement. She gazed down at the dark engineer. "I need to  see the Captain", she explained before turning and exiting the holodeck.</p>
<P>B’Elanna slumped back down onto the blanket with a groan. As she had listened  to Seven and given her advice, she realised that her words were equally relevant  to her own predicament. She had been given the perfect opportunity to express  her feelings but had been stymied by her abrupt departure. She put both her  fists to her head in frustration. She had probably blown the one chance she had  with Seven. She spun around to lie on her front, grabbed her jacket from the  neat pile of clothing to make a pillow, and settled down to relax, trying not to  chastise herself needlessly and pondered over what Seven would tell the  Captain.</P>
