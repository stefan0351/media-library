<!-- No Place Like It \ Part 19 -->

<p>"So ... Katie?" Eli commented turning his
attention away from the TV and turning to face his sister. He'd seen this episode
before.</p>

<p>"Yep," Jessie replied watching as Ozzy worked
diligently on his drawing of what looked like 'The Screaming Man' with claws.
She didn't understand how Eli could have watched this show in its original run and
then continually watch the rerun marathons. She wanted to hit herself in the head with a
frying pan and they were only five minutes into the episode.</p>

<p>"How'd that happen?" Eli asked, his
attention back on the screen as Ozzy begged Sharon not to let Kelly bring home any more
cats. He saw his future there before him and he was actually looking forward to it.</p>

<p>"She's getting sued," Jessie replied
watching the TV and seeing Eli's future while wondering if he was looking forward to
it.</p>

<p>"Fun," Eli returned nodding his head.</p>

<p>"We're going to win," Jessie replied with a
shrug. The words slam and dunk flashing neon in her mind.</p>

<p>"I bet what she likes most about you is your
humility," Eli commented smiling at his little sisters smugness.</p>

<p>"I seriously doubt that's what she likes
best," Jessie returned looking over to meet her brother's gaze causing them both
to break out smiling.</p>

<p>"You happy?" Eli asked seriously a moment later.</p>

<p>"Very," Jessie responded.</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so," Jessie replied
smiling over at Eli.</p>

<p>"Mom know?" Eli asked feeling Jessie's head
fall against his shoulder and raising his hand up to ruffle her hair.</p>

<p>"Nah," Jessie replied batting his hand away from
her head and glaring at him. She was pretty sure she didn't have the words
'petting zoo' tattooed across her forehead. Eli's shirt on the other hand,
did say 'Pit Stop' so she felt justified using him as a cushion. Eli had
inherited their father's snuggly gene, he really had.</p>

<p>"Can I tell her? Please," Eli asked smiling
teasingly, though he seriously wanted to be there when Karen found out that Jessie was
back with Katie.</p>

<p>"Get out of my house," Jessie responded pointing
to the door though she made no effort to remove her head from his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You have any cheese snaps?" Eli asked not even
paying attention to her.</p>

<p>"What kind of question is that?" Jessie asked
peevishly. "Of course I have cheese snaps."</p>

<p>"You're a good woman," Eli commented. Grace
never bought cheese snaps.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell Grace you said that,"
Jessie responded smiling. Nothing got Grace going like comments regarding typical gender
stereotypes that had been enforced through centuries of patriarchal rule.</p>

<p>"Please don't," Eli said. He was pretty sure
he was whining, and surprisingly he was okay with it.</p>

<p>"You are so whipped," Jessie teased, raising her
hand and snapping her wrist.</p>

<p>"Shut up," Eli grumbled.</p>

<p>"When's the baby due?" Jessie asked still
smiling.</p>

<p>"Dunno," Eli replied. "Though it's
gotta pop out soon, if she gets any bigger I think she's going to explode."</p>

<p>"You're an idiot," Jessie replied her body
racked with laughter.</p>

<p>slightly. And with that she picked up a few of the books
surrounding her and headed for the door as well.</p>
