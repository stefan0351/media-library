<!-- Well, This Happened \ Part 20 -->

<p>Nicole took a seat on the plush, maroon loveseat in the Novak, rubbing her
thumb and forefinger together deviously, while watching Brooke out the
corner of her eyes.  Something seemed different with the other girl, she had
lost that glow the had had for the last month or so and Nicole began to
wonder if Josh had seriously won her back.  Truthfully she had made the
offer not really thinking it would work, if Brooke was smitten enough Spam
to have actually endangered her social standing by sleeping with her, Nicole
had doubted that she would just dump her like yesterday's news.  Either way,
she was intensely interested to hear what Brooke now had to say.</p>

<p>"I think," Brooke began pacing the length of the room restlessly, "that
we're beyond small talk regarding this particular matter," she continued
wanting to get straight to business.  She doubted it would be pleasant
whether it took them an hour or a minute to get down to it, and frankly her
heart couldn't handle an hour.</p>

<p>"What particular matter would this particular matter be?" Nicole asked
smiling sweetly at the other girl.  She wondered what had taken Brooke so
long, after the scene in the cafeteria she had expected to have a little
chat with Brooke, however the blonde disappeared for the rest of day.</p>

<p>"My relationship with Sam," Brooke responded meeting Nicole's gaze.</p>

<p>"I was under the impression that that had passed," Nicole responded.</p>

<p>"It hasn't," Brooke responded meeting Nicole's gaze with a steely one of her
own.  "I could say more, but I don't think it's necessary.  The reason I
asked you to come here is because I know what you're planning to do."</p>

<p>"Planning to do?  What are you talking about?" Nicole drawled lazily.  She
was at least pleased to hear that she hadn't wasted the years she had spent
under Brooke, over that period of time she had learned to read the other
girl like a children's novel.  Brooke, so nice, so bloody predictable.</p>

<p>"I'm talking about you outing us," Brooke responded simply.  She wasn't
going to play these word games with Nicole, she didn't have the time or the
inclination.  The brutal honesty of the statement caused Nicole to stop
inspecting her fingernails and look over at the girl standing in front of
her.  So Brooke could still surprise her every now and then, that didn't
mean anything.</p>

<p>"Outing is such a harsh word," Nicole responded carefully.  "I prefer to
think of it as spreading the good news.  What ever happened to singing it
from the mountain tops, Brooke?"</p>

<p>"You can think of it however you 'prefer' to, it doesn't change what it is,"
Brooke responded solemnly.  "Please Nic, don't do this."</p>

<p>"You're the one that did the doing, Brookie," Nicole responded.  "You knew
what it would mean and you fucked her anyway.  I hope it was good Brooke,
cause you'll be suffering from the consequences of that indulgence for a
while.  Basically, you're screwed."</p>

<p>"It doesn't have to be this way," Brooke said a pleading tone entering her
voice.  "You're suppose to be my friend…my best friend, I never thought
you'd stab me the moment I turned my back to you."</p>

<p>"Never turn your back to anyone Brooke, especially not to someone like me,"
Nicole responded her tone darkening.  "I'm no good.  People have been
telling you that for years.  But you never believed them, did you?  Even
when you saw me rip through people without breaking a sweat.  That's what I
loved about you Brookie, your unwavering faith.  But a cheetah can't hide
her spots forever, and now you're finally having to connect the dots.  You
were convenient, now you're a liability.  On the African plains when a
member of the tribe becomes weak the others leave them to die, then rip them
shreds…so the strong can survive.  You're reign is over…your most stunning
defeat by your own tongue," Nicole finished as she circled Brooke.  She was
like a vulture circling her pray in the hot desert sun, taking little
nibbles at it before died.</p>

<p>"Nicole…"</p>

<p>"What?  You think I don't mean it?" Nicole asked her voice raising slightly.
  "I'm tired of being your lap dog.  Someone would have tore you apart years
ago if it wasn't for me.  Christ, Mary Cherry has got more balls than you
do.  That girl would kill, literally, for what you've got, and you piss and
moan it away.  Well, you're on your own this time, you've engineered your
own defeat.  This time it's all on you, because the only thing I've got on
my side is the truth.  And if that's what you're scared of, then you've got
bigger problems then me."</p>

<p>Brooke simply stared at the girl once she finished speaking, her head was
pounding and she found herself falling into a nearby chair.  Under the
hostility, and the snide-ness and the Darwinian logic, Nicole had a point.
There was a bigger issue there than the betrayal of confidence that Brooke
had been focusing on.  This wasn't an issue of Nicole merely threatening to
tell her secret, it was a case of her being ashamed of her secret.  Nicole
was right, the truth was that Brooke was dating Sam, that they loved each
other and that Brooke was absolutely terrified of the population at large
finding out about it.  The only thing that gave Nicole power in this
situation was their fear, her fear.</p>

<p>Intellectually, Brooke had always known that was underlying principle behind
it all; that being involved with Sam would have a slew of after effects that
wouldn't be nearly as pleasurable as the fact that they were together.  And
sitting there in the washroom of her school with Nicole staring down at her
like some predator from the safari, Brooke was painfully aware of all of the
reasons she wanted to keep the relationship a secret, and alternately of all
the reasons she felt terribly ashamed for feeling ashamed of what she and
Sam had together.</p>

<p>Nicole was right, Brooke did have bigger problems than her, and Brooke had
no idea what to do about them.</p>

<p>"I love her," Brooke breathed out wretchedly as she squeezed her eyes shut
trying to hold in the tears threatening to fall.  "Why can't that be
enough?"  She wasn't sure who she was talking to, herself of Nicole.</p>

<p>"Because it's not," Nicole answered softly.  The malevolence so prevalent in
her previous sermon had dissipated as a result of Brooke's collapse and
uttered declarations.  Despite herself Nicole was moved by the display.  She
could see Brooke tearing herself apart, digging into herself and bleeding.
It was oddly compelling, seeing her fall apart like, seeing her disassemble
right before her own eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," Brooke continued, as the tears she had tried so
valiantly to hold escaped from their prison and cascaded down her cheeks.
"I love her so much I almost can't remember what it was like before we were
together…but being with her is killing everything that I know.  Sometimes,
it hurts so much and I get so scared that I can't breath…but I can't stop
feeling how I feel.  Even though it's ruining me, I can't stop loving her,"
she concluded, looking up at Nicole with luminescent tear filled eyes.</p>

<p>Nicole watched Brooke disassemble even further after that, could see her
crumbling in front of her eyes until all that she could make out of the girl
was a mass of quivering, wet flesh.  She turned away.  This was opportunity
that she had been waiting for.  Yes, Brooke had been a friend to her, the
best friend that she had ever had, but that was in the past and it was time
to look forward.  She had to look forward.  However, even as these thoughts
ran through her head the blonde turned back around to observe Brooke's
figure, small and cowering.  She felt her eyes begin to well with the sting
of unshed tears and she averted her eyes once more.</p>

<p>Struggling with herself for a moment, Nicole finally turned back to face
Brooke.  She stood there watching her for a moment more, then crossed the
short distance between them and wrapped her arms Brooke who almost
immediately turned into her shoulder and began to cry in earnest.  Nicole
held the shuddering body in her arms and sighed deeply to herself.  There
was a reason Brooke McQueen was the most popular girl in school, and it
wasn't because she accessorized well, and was tall and blonde-although those
things didn't hurt.  It was because there was a fine line between being
admired and incurring peoples hate, it was a line that Brooke walked
masterfully without even knowing it.  To put it succinctly, the girl was a
sympathetic character despite her obvious privilege.  It wasn't a matter of
having to love her, or even like her, as much as the fact that you couldn't
quite hate her, and that was enough.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Nicole heard Brooke whisper as she finally pulled herself
together and began to separate herself from her friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, I've always had a soft spot for blondes…that's why I became
one," Nicole responded standing up and offering her hand to Brooke.  "We
have to get you cleaned up, to borrow a phrase from Mary Cherry, you look
like you look like ten miles of bad road."</p>

<p>Brooke grasped her hand, but regarded the other girl somewhat dubiously.</p>

<p>"I let you cry on Pashmina, don't even think about looking at me like that,"
Nicole responded grumpily.</p>

<p>"It's good to have you back," Brooke replied smiling slightly.  Nicole
rolled her eyes in response but a small smile appeared on her face too.  A
little-and she stressed the little part-of her was glad to be back too.</p>
