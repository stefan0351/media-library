<!-- Fire and Ice \ Epilogue -->

<P>Danielle stood on the balcony of their new home, looking out wistfully at the Aegean. It was a spectacular view.
Alex watched thoughtfully. Slowly she approached and placed a hand on her lover’s shoulder.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you regret giving up your family and your roots to come with me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not for a moment.&quot; Danielle turned to face Alex. &quot;You are my family. My home is wherever you
are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Danielle, thanks for seeing this through with me. I’ve never known such happiness.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If anyone deserves to be happy, it’s you.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex was quiet, thoughtful. &quot;It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, pointing that gun at you.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle looked at her lovingly. She placed her hand gently over the bruise on her chest. &quot;It’s still bothering
me some.&quot; Alex’s brows wrinkled in concerned.</P>
<P>A twinkle lit Danielle’s eyes. &quot;Yeah, I think you had better take a look. I’m sure that magical touch of
yours can make it better.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled and gave her partner a flirtive glance. &quot;I’ll see what I can do.&quot;</P>
<P>She carefully unbuttoned her lover’s blouse and was relieved to see that the nasty bruise had faded quite a
bit. Her eyes immediately fell to her lover’s erect nipples. Without hesitation she caressed one with her lips.</P>
<P>Danielle took a deep breath. &quot;Ah... I think you are a little off the bruise.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Mmm, can’t be too careful.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle smiled and closed her eyes. &quot;I think you’re right... I can feel it spreading... lower.&quot;</P>
<P>Never one to take chances, Alex followed her lover’s direction. She dropped to her knees, intent on giving every
inch of her skin loving attention. Danielle’s moans confirmed that Alex’s touch did work magic. Everything around
them disappeared.</P>
