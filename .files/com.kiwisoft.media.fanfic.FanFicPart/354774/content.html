<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 5 -->

<p>It was after midnight, when Alex gently guided Sam to her front doorstep. He turned to her and smiled. <i>I don't think she realises how beautiful she really is. </i></p>
		<p>"I really had a great time tonight."</p>
		<p>Sam smiled at him. "I did too, thankyou". And she meant it. She had been really nervous about tonight, asking herself over and over again why such a good looking guy like him would choose her out of all the girls at Kennedy High.</p>
		<p><i>He could have anyone he wanted. And he chose me.</i> </p>
		<p>And that made her feel damn good. </p>
		<p>He stared at her and quickly came to a decision. Taking a deep breath, he steeled himself  for possible rejection and asked the question he had been wanting to ask since he first laid eyes on her earlier that night.</p>
		<p><i>Just say it and get it over with Alex, before you lose your nerve. Knowing my luck Brooke will suddenly appear out of no where, killing me with her death glare.</i></p>
		<p>"I really like you Sam and I was hoping that we could do this again. See more of each other. Would you like to?" He looked away, suddenly finding the bushes fascinating.</p>
		<p><i>That's so cute! He's shy! </i></p>
		<p>She smiled at him, charmed. "Yes, I'd like that. Very much". </p>
		<p>He grinned. "Great! Fantastic! I mean, great! I'm glad!"</p>
		<p>Sam laughed. He stopped, shooting her an embarrassed grin when he realised that he had been babbling. He stared at her again and slowly, slowly he leaned in, bringing his face closer to hers. </p>
		<p>Sam started to panic as she realised what he wanted to do. <i>Oh my god! He's going to kiss me! Oh my god!</i></p>
		<p>It was an awkward kiss, hesitant at first, but as Alex grew more confident, and Sam began to relax, the kiss became more passionate. A detached part of herself began analysing the thoughts and feelings that she was experiencing.</p>
		<p><i>Hmmmm, he has nice breath. That's nice to know. Good oral hygiene.</i></p>
		<p><i>Ooo, no sticking the tongue down my throat, that's always good.  He's a good kisser, even my lack of experience can figure that out. </i></p>
		<p><i>But....is that it? Shouldn't I be feeling more...horny or something? </i></p>
		<p>Alex gently pulled away, and looked down at her, a huge smile on his face.</p>
		<p>"That was nice".</p>
		<p>Sam smiled. "Yes, it was." </p>
		<p>And that's all it was. Just...nice.</p>
		<p>There had to be more to it than that. Where were the fireworks? The sounds of bells ringing? The glory glory alleluia music sung by a choir of angels? Or at the very least, why wasn't her blood boiling, or hormones heading southwards? There wasn't much of that happening.</p>
		<p>At least, not on her side anyway.</p>
		<p><i>Maybe we need to use our tongues a little more. Should I grab his ass? Or maybe he should grab mine? </i><i>Let's give it another shot shall we...</i></p>
		<p>Wanting to test her theory, she pulled Alex towards her again, and kissed him with as much passion as she could muster. Long moments later, she pulled away and looked at him, hiding her confusion behind a smile. </p>
		<p><i>And still, it was lacking. I want the bells, damn it!</i></p>
		<p>"Wow. I can definitely get used to that". Alex smiled, tightening his hold on Sam's waist. </p>
		<p>Sam smiled. "Likewise, but not out here. We've got plenty of time for that later". </p>
		<p>She kissed him again, quickly, and stepped out from his embrace.</p>
		<p>"Good night Alex, and thankyou. I had a wonderful time."</p>
		<p>He smiled at her, kissing her on the cheek. "I'll call you, okay?". </p>
		<p>She nodded, standing on the steps, deep in thought as she watched him walk away. </p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Walking into the living room, Sam noticed a familiar lump sprawled on the couch. </p>
		<p>She smiled, and walked over, crouching beside Brooke, content to just watch her for several minutes. Realising the time, she brushed aside a stray lock of blonde hair,  then grabbed Brooke by her shoulders and gently shook her awake.</p>
		<p>"Come on Sleeping Beauty, wake up."</p>
		<p>"Dad, I mean it! You can't use my pom poms to wax the car!". Brooke attempted to slap Sams hands away, all the while mumbling incoherently.</p>
		<p>Sam laughed. "Brooke, it's almost twelve thirty. Get up. I want to go to bed". </p>
		<p><i>Now that sounded kinkier than I intended.</i></p>
		<p>Brooke slowly opened her eyes, to see a smirking Sam hovering over her. She smiled. </p>
		<p><i>I wouldn't mind waking up to that everyday.</i></p>
		<p>"Oh. Hey. When did you get in?"</p>
		<p>"Five minutes ago. You weren't waiting up for me were you?"</p>
		<p>"Of course not". <i>Damn straight, I was! </i></p>
		<p>"I was reading actually".</p>
		<p>"Reading? With your eyes closed?"</p>
		<p>"Ha ha. Very funny."</p>
		<p>Sam looked around, but couldn't see a book anywhere.</p>
		<p>"What were you reading? Or did your book decide to go for a walk?" Sam smiled at her.</p>
		<p><i>Ooops.</i> <i>I never was a convincing liar. </i></p>
		<p>Brooke tried to deflect her lame attempt at lying by changing the subject.</p>
		<p>"I had an interesting visit tonight".</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah? From who?"</p>
		<p>"Josh".</p>
		<p>Uh oh. Sam grimaced and ran a hand through her hair. </p>
		<p>"Brooke, Josh coming over isn't that out of the ordinary."</p>
		<p>"Maybe not, but his reason behind it is." Brooke stared at Sam. Sam shuffled in her seat and looked away. No one made a move to speak. Becoming uncomfortable with the silence, Sam finally confessed.</p>
		<p>"Okay! It was me. I called him and told him to come over and keep you company. I didn't want you to be alone and I figured you missed him."</p>
		<p>"Missed him? Why did you think that?" </p>
		<p>"Well, you have been behaving a little weird recently". </p>
		<p>"No I haven't."</p>
		<p>"Okay, I take that back. You've been nuts".</p>
		<p>"I resent that! You cannot go around slandering innocent people!".</p>
		<p>Brooke paused. </p>
		<p>"Examples please."</p>
		<p>"Brooke, I found you banging your head against the table yesterday!" </p>
		<p>"Okay, so that was a little weird. I usually prefer the wall". Brooke laughed but stopped when she realised that Sam didn't find her joke the least bit funny. </p>
		<p>Sam ignored her and continued to provide evidence in the "Brooke has gone looney" case.</p>
		<p>"That was disturbing enough in itself, but you've also been quiet lately. You lock yourself up in your room and play sappy love songs. Not only that, and I never thought I'd live to see it, but you said no to going shopping with Dumb and Dumber after school yesterday! You?! Say no to shopping?! I couldn't believe it!" Sam shook her head in amazement.</p>
		<p>"Would it be that hard to believe, on that particular day, I preferred to come home than go shopping?"</p>
		<p>"Yes".</p>
		<p>"Oh". Brooke paused. "So what has that got to do with me missing Josh?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I figured that you wanted to get back together with him".</p>
		<p>"What?!"  </p>
		<p>Sam mistook Brooke's outburst for embarrassment.</p>
		<p>"It's okay, I promise it'll stay between us. He loves you Brooke and he'd take you back in a second if you asked him".</p>
		<p>"I can't believe this". Brooke jumped up and began to pace. </p>
		<p>Sam was confused. Here she was, trying to be supportive, but Brooke looked like she wanted to throw something.</p>
		<p>"Did I say something wrong?" </p>
		<p>Brooke stopped her pacing and calmed down. </p>
		<p>"No, no you didn't". </p>
		<p>Actually, it was kind of funny when she stopped to think about it. Sam was trying to hook her up with Josh, and Josh was trying to hook her up with Sam. </p>
		<p>Brooke began to laugh.</p>
		<p>Sam stared. </p>
		<p><i>Okay, I was wrong. She's insane.</i></p>
