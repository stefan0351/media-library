<!-- A Connected Love \ Chapter 7: A forced separation -->

<p>"Hmmm... that is an interesting thing. Love you say?"</p>
<p>"That were my words master."</p>
<p>"Then let's get started. Gather your best soldiers and do your best to follow my will."</p>
<p>"Yes my master." And with that the scout left the inner circle of their members and the leaders of the Rholtha clan. He would do whatever was needed to succeed and fulfill the hopes and needs of his masters.</p>
<p>He smiled at the thought what he would do with that little slayer as soon as she was one of them. He probably would make her his and play with her until he didn't want her anymore and then just kill her. It wasn't really the best idea to kill a member, especially if he had managed to turn a slayer but he had enough time to think about that as soon as he had her on his side. He had scarcely thought about the way he served his master but it was surely enjoying to be one of the best and as such have some freedom about what he did and how he did it. And he used every opportunity to receive more of that freedom and maybe even one time to be elected into the leadership. But for now all he would do was to capture that girl and turn that slayer.</p>

<p>Willow woke up and noticed the warmth of Buffy's body behind her. It was so comforting. She sighed at the thought of needing to get up early and do some research to learn the last few spells to cast the gateway and hide it. 'Hmmm... 6:22 I still have some time.' She turned around to face Buffy and started to gaze at her. 'So beautiful. It took too long for us to notice.'</p>
<p>She sighed again and slowly entangled herself from Buffy, careful not to wake her up, and then started to get dressed. Then she went back to the bed and kissed 'her slayer' on the forehead and smiled, then headed for the door and stopped in the doorway to take a last look before she left the room.</p>
<p>She went down and into the kitchen to set up a dough for a few pancakes and fried a few of them. She wrote a short message where she was and then left the house.</p>
<p>Just outside, she was suddenly knocked down by something very large. Her last thought before she fell into unconsciousness was 'BUFFY!! Help!'</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Buffy startled in her dream. She was dancing with Willow in the Bronze and suddenly heard her. 'BUFFY!! Help!'. She looked into the eyes of Willow scared that something bad had happened when she saw her fade away. "Willow wait." It was her last thought before she woke up. Her eyes shot open and she scanned the room but Willow wasn't there. She was really worried now.</p>
<p>"Willow? Willow, are you here?"</p>
<p>No answer. She headed down just to find the door open. Leaving the house she found Willow's laptop outside on the floor. Her mouth was suddenly dry.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, Willow..." she exhaled.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Giles was getting worried. He had agreed with Willow that they would meet at his house at 7 o'clock. It was now 7:30. Just then he heard the phone ring.</p>
<p>"Hello? Buffy? No she's not here... No I haven't seen her... yes I'll call when I see her. Buffy- Buffy calm down. Now tell me what's wrong."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>After a short talk on the phone about what she had found, Buffy got dressed and ran over to Giles.</p>
<p>Giles heard a knock and went to open the door. Unsurprisingly Buffy was outside. He let her in and she just went over to the couch and took a seat.</p>
<p>"It's all my fault. It's all my fault. I didn't protect her, you know Giles? That's what I normally should do. And now those demons have her." she said with tears welling in her eyes.</p>
<p>She gave him a note.</p>
<p>'We have your little red-haired friend. If you want her back then come to the south graveyard at midnight. Alone!'</p>
<p>"Well first of all this is not your fault. You can't be everywhere. And second how could you have known that this would happen? You are the Slayer and not the Oracle of Sunnydale. You cannot know everything."</p>
<p>"Maybe not, but I could have protected HER. After all, we have spent the..." she stopped herself before she could say too much and let her head sink into her hands and started to cry.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>Willow woke up in what seemed to be a tent, built around a tree. She tried to get up but then noticed that she was tied up against that tree. Then suddenly a demon appeared in front of her, almost if he has just been created out of thin air, a small distortion effect seemed to surround it.</p>
<p>"Ahhh... our little slayer-friend is awake. You should better not try to leave this place. You would be dead before you had moved even one foot."</p>
<p>That demon looked at her with a look that could be best identified as a smile. She stopped struggling and took a closer look at it and tried her best to project that picture in Buffy.</p>
<p>"You know, at least some of you could at least try to use a little hygiene?"</p>
<p>"Heh. Funny. You're tied against a tree, caught by a bunch of demons and you think about hygiene."</p>
<p>"Well it's the best... actually... the only thing I can think of, as long as you're here. And since I'm not dead yet, I suppose that you need me for something."</p>
<p>"True my little girl. We need your presence to trap the slayer. But don't think that we need you longer than that. And the more you do to anger me, the sooner you'll be dead. I don't think that the slayer will do much to avoid our trap. Not with that look in her eyes."</p>
<p>"What look?"</p>
<p>"Love, my dear. Love. It's the only thing that causes people to risk their lives for somebody else without thinking. And your little slayer had that look. And we'll use it against her. So if you prefer to live long enough to see her a last time, then keep quiet and don't even think about fleeing."</p>
<p>With that it vaporized again only leaving a small trail of waved air behind it as it left.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"You have spent. what?"</p>
<p>Buffy ignored him, unable to calm down. The only person she could think of at the moment was kidnapped by a group of invisible demons. She was probably the only person that was knowledgeable enough, beside of Giles, to open such a gateway. And Buffy couldn't even think of what she would do if Willow would die.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Buffy, come on, tell me what you wanted to say."</p>
<p>Buffy's head shot up as a image entered it. She could see a demon that seemed to talk but couldn't hear anything.</p>
<p>'Willow? Willow are you there?'</p>
<p>'Oh god Buffy. Am I glad to hear you.'</p>
<p>'Willow, I'll get you out of there. I'll get you out.'</p>
<p>'Buffy, I'm tied up against a tree and from that what I hear there are just too many to fight. Don't risk your life if all you could do here would be dying.'</p>
<p>'Willow I will not allow you to think about that. We'll find a way to get you out and I will not let you be harmed.'</p>
<p>Her connection was cut off as Giles put a hand on her shoulder and shaked her.</p>
<p>"Buffy? Buffy?" He had a concerned look on his face. "Buffy, tell me what you mean. I'm here and I'll listen to whatever you have to say."</p>
<p>"Wha- What? Oh sorry, I was just talking to Willow. She doesn't want me to rescue her. She says it is a trap."</p>
<p>"Buffy what are you talking about? Willow isn't here."</p>
<p>'Should I tell him? It would surely help us to find a solution but I really don't want to go through that whole 'why?' discussion.'</p>
<p>'Buffy, tell him. He will understand.'</p>
<p>Buffy was startled by Willow entering her head again but was fast enough back in Giles living room to see his puzzled face.</p>
<p>'Ok Buffy, then let's tell him' she encouraged to herself.</p>
<p>"Well... it's quite complicated but to say it in its shortest form Willow and I have... sorta a telepathic connection. I really don't know how or why but it's there. It started after I had..." trailing off Buffy wished she hadn't said that last sentence.</p>
<p>"After what?" Giles frowned at the thought that such a thing could be possible but listened to her.</p>
<p>"Uh... well... I think it started after Willow and I... ah... kind of..." she hesitated. She really didn't want to go that far. " ummm... had... I think it started after our visit here on Saturday." she said, relieved that she found way to avoid telling him that she and Willow were together. She was simply not that far yet.</p>
<p>"Hmmm seems another thing that Willow has developed lately."</p>
<p>"Yeah Willow..."</p>
<p>"And you're now in contact with her?"</p>
<p>"Sort of."</p>
<p>"Well then I think I know a way how we can free her."</p>
<p>"Really? That's great. How?"</p>
<p>"Well we'll just tell her what she shall do and none of the demons should actually notice."</p>
<p>"Seems like a great idea. When shall we start?"</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Seems like our little redhead has accepted the way things will go." the demon said appearing in front of Willow.</p>
<p>"No, I'm just imagining how it will be when Buffy arrives here. In a good-for-me-bad-for-you kind of way."</p>
<p>The demon let out a loud laughter and then pierced her up with glowing green eyes.</p>
<p>"You have such a fantasy. It will be a pleasure to see you die."</p>
<p>"I don't really think that that would be a pleasure from your seat in the lounge in hell." she said a wicked smile growing across her face.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that she will send you all back to hell before you have any opportunity to see me die."</p>
<p>"You really have a great fantasy. Maybe I'll turn you and not kill you. It would be of advantage to have such a person in our clan."</p>
<p>"Go to hell!"</p>
<p>"Nah, I don't think so. Been there and came back. But I'll make sure that you'll land there" and with that it vaporized again.</p>
<p>'Willow? Can you hear me?'</p>
<p>'Buffy! Oh I'm so glad to hear you.'</p>
<p>'Nice to hear that but I think me and Giles know a way to rescue you.'</p>
<p>'How?'</p>
<p>'Do you think you can send me a short look at the surroundings?'</p>
<p>'Sure, though there's not much to say other than that I'm in a tent tied against a tree.' and with that she let Buffy see through her eyes.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>
<p>"Ok here's the thing. Willow is tied up against a tree. I'd say about four or five feet thick and she is in a tent about seven or eight yards from one side to the other."</p>
<p>"Ok, then the next step."</p>
<p>'Willow you think you can check if there are any of those demons inside of the tent? I mean with that spell you used yesterday.'</p>
<p>'Should be no problem.'</p>
<p>Buffy heard Willow chant, although she was actually too far away to be able to do that. But she could hear her think the words. After a few minutes of chanting and Giles slowly getting worried she heard Willow talk to her again.</p>
<p>'No demons inside but two a few feet outside guarding the entrance.'</p>
<p>'Okay should be enough for now. We'll tell you the spell to create a gateway inside the tent so that you can keep it open. And hide it. Then all you have to do is lure a few of them into the tent. That should give us the distraction we need to find and rescue you. I just hope that none of those beasts comes in just in that moment.'</p>
<p>'Yeah, Ok Buffy but be careful.'</p>
<p>'You know me. I'm the always-careful slayer.'</p>
<p>With that she opened her eyes and spoke up to tell Giles the development. After a few minutes of explaining he stood up and went to get the book where the spell was listed in. In the meanwhile Buffy went back to talking to Willow through their connection. A connection for which she thanked all gods she knew now.</p>
