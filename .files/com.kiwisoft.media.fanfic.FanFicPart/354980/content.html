<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 35: Cimarron Crossing -->

<p>Despite the late start, they still made good time before dusk
		started to settle and Josie decided to stop for the night. She turned the wagon off the
		trail, stopping it only when she was certain that she was far enough away that a fire
		wouldn't attract attention from the rutted road. They unhitched the horses and tended to
		their needs before going about setting up the camp. Josie went in search of dry brush and
		wood for the fire while Rebecca unpacked the gear that they would need for the night.</p>

		<p>After sleeping next to Josie for the last few nights, it seemed
		strange to her to set their blankets on opposite sides of the fire. It didn't seem right
		to set them side by side either. Rebecca solved her dilemma by setting her blankets ninety
		degrees from Josie's around the fire. She was careful to place her pillow on the end
		closest to the gunslinger, knowing full well what her feet were like after a long hot day
		packed in her boots. Thinking about her companion's own ability to smell like she traipsed
		through a swamp whenever she removed her black boots, Rebecca set Josie's pillow in a
		similar manner. The end result was their heads would be less than four feet apart during
		the night, close enough to be near without being on top of each other. Once the sleeping
		arrangements were settled, Rebecca began setting up the ring of stones that would circle
		the fire before setting out the coffee and cooking pots, their flat metal plates for
		eating, and their utensils.</p>

		<p>The young woman was rummaging through the supplies, trying to
		figure out where Josie had packed their tin mugs when she felt the sensation of being
		watched. Rebecca's heart raced and her breathing increased, and her mouth suddenly felt
		very dry. She knew the gunslinger would most likely be within earshot, but found herself
		unable to utter a sound. Her eyes fell on the Winchester lying propped against the seat of
		the wagon. Acting as if she was still looking for the elusive mugs, Rebecca climbed up in
		the back of the wagon and slowly moved forward until she was within arms reach of the
		rifle. "What are you looking for?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca jumped visibly at the sound of Josie's voice behind her.
		"Oh, land sakes Josie, you scared the daylights out of me," she said as she
		turned to face the grinning gunslinger. "I thought there was a bandit sneaking up on
		us." She placed her hand over her still rapidly beating heart. Her fear turned to
		anger as she watched the older woman smile even wider and hold her hand out to help
		Rebecca off the wagon. "Why did you do that to me?" she said annoyed as she
		stepped down.</p>

		<p>"I wasn't trying to scare you, Rebecca, I was trying to find
		out what you were up to." The smile disappeared and Josie became serious. "You
		did good, though, you didn't panic or scream. That's an improvement."</p>

		<p>"I would have shot you if you hadn't spoken up," the
		young woman said with an angry tone in her voice.</p>

		<p>"Uh huh," she replied, not believing a word of it.</p>

		<p>"Well, I would have waited to see who it was first, but
		then..." she pointed her finger out at the gunslinger and made the motion of a hammer
		falling.</p>

		<p>"You would have waited to see who it was and even then tried
		to talk the person into surrendering," Josie said confidently. Rebecca smiled in
		acknowledgment.</p>

		<p>"Yeah...come on, let's find the mugs so we can get the
		dinner fixings going," she said, turning back the wagon to look for the missing items
		again. "Josie, where did you hide the cups?"</p>

		<p>The tall woman reached over Rebecca's shoulder and picked up the
		one canvas sack that the young woman hadn't checked yet. "Josie, why did you put them
		in there? That's where the towels are. I don't want to taste towel fuzz in my
		coffee."</p>

		<p>"Would you rather have had them bounce around the wagon and
		make more noise than a dozen washboards? We don't need to be announcing our presence from
		miles away," the gunslinger replied. Rebecca looked at the wagon again, noting for
		the first time that there was a piece of leather nailed on one side of the washboard, the
		other end going over the wood and metal object and hooking on a nail on the opposite side.</p>

		<p>"You think of everything, don't you?" the young woman
		said in awe of her friend's foresight.</p>

		<p>"Not everything...I haven't figured out a way to cook the
		jackrabbit I caught while looking for firewood without some matches to start the
		fire." She arched her eyebrow and looked at her young companion and received a
		sheepish grin in reply as Rebecca turned and retrieved a match from their supply.</p>

		<p>The evening was passed fairly quietly with the gunslinger
		cleaning her weapons and Rebecca repairing yet another tear Josie managed to make in her
		shirt. Staring at the thin and worn material in her hands, the young woman contemplated
		tossing the black shirt in the fire 'accidentally', but instead sighed and continued her
		precise stitching.</p>

		<p>Sleep was another matter altogether. Twice Josie woke the younger
		woman up with her thrashing about when demons visited her dreams. Rebecca sat scant inches
		away from the gunslinger's head, softly speaking to her. "Shh, it's all right
		now...it's okay...." she continued to gently try to coax Josie back to a peaceful
		rest, her own heart feeling the pain the sleeping woman was suffering through. She crawled
		to Josie's side and brought her head to her breast. With feather light touches she stroked
		her hair as she sang one song after another until the gunslinger was still, her breathing
		even. Morning would find the outlaw sleeping with her face pillowed on Rebecca's soft
		breast. She did not know when the young woman came to join her, but the feeling of
		contentment she felt upon waking to find her so close made her want to kiss her until she
		wakened. With a sigh she realized that Rebecca had never given her any reason to believe
		she would welcome her advances, so reluctantly she untangled her limbs from the sleeping
		woman and rose to start the day.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The sun shone brightly down on the small campsite. Josie took a
		sip of the coffee and winced. She really wished Rebecca was an early riser or at least had
		set the coffee up the night before. No matter how hard she tried, Josie was unable to make
		the beverage taste right. She looked over at the sleeping form, buried deep beneath the
		blankets that the gunslinger had covered her with upon waking and finding her uncovered.
		Josie could only surmise that she had once again woken Rebecca up with her nightmares.
		Feeling a bit guilty, she decided to let the young woman sleep in instead of waking her.</p>

		<p>Rebecca woke to the smell of bacon burning in the frying pan. She
		wrinkled her nose and poked her head out from under the blankets, squinting from the
		bright sunshine. "Are you trying to cook?" she asked groggily, her eyes focusing
		on the gunslinger as she frantically tried to move the smoking meat from the pan onto the
		metal plate.</p>

		<p>"Trying," Josie muttered, looking down at the blackened
		strips. "Glad to see you're awake."</p>

		<p>"Why?", she said as she sat up and stretched.</p>

		<p>"Because I'm hungry," she said smiling. "I, uh,
		tried to make coffee too," she said holding out the tin mug to Rebecca, who took one
		sniff and shook her head.</p>

		<p>"Let me take care of nature and I'll get breakfast
		ready," she said, rising to her feet.</p>

		<p>"And coffee, don't forget about that," Josie said to
		the retreating blonde.</p>

		<p>"And coffee," Rebecca yelled back, grinning. She heard
		the splash of the gunslinger's attempt at the morning drink being dumped on the ground.
		Josie's many skills obviously didn't include anything domestic, the young woman joked to
		herself.</p>

		<p>The next two days continued in much the same fashion, except that
		the gunslinger didn't try to cook anything. Rebecca had, at Josie's suggestion, set the
		coffee pot up the night before so all the tall woman would have to do was add water and
		heat it up when she woke. It worked out well, allowing Josie to enjoy some private time in
		the morning and affording Rebecca a couple of much needed extra hours of sleep. The beds
		stayed in the same position and the nightmares continued. Despite the young woman's
		protests that she wasn't always woken up by Josie's cries during the night, the gunslinger
		didn't believe her, especially when the telltale dark circles started to appear under the
		green eyes.</p>

		<p>On the third day, they were taken by surprise by a sudden storm.
		Within seconds, what began as a light spattering of drops developed into an all out
		teeming downpour. Josie pulled the wagon to a stop and both women tried frantically to
		cover their belongings with a large piece of canvas, but the sudden gusts of wind
		threatened to take the cloth away from them before they could get it tied down. There was
		no time to look for Josie's riding duster or Rebecca's cloak before they were both soaked
		to the bone. "Lay down on top of the canvas to hold it down," the gunslinger
		yelled, trying to be heard over the driving rain. "I'm going to try to find us some
		shelter. Hold on!" Flossy seemed as eager as the outlaw to find a place out of the
		deluge and she responded when Josie slapped the reins on her backside by breaking into a
		trot.</p>

		<p>Josie could barely see the trail in front of her, and if not for
		Rebecca they would have passed by the little sod cabin in a stand of trees. Rebecca did
		not think she could make herself heard, so she simply tapped Josie sharply on her thigh
		and pointed toward the cabin. Josie veered off the trail and pulled the wagon sharply to a
		stop under the trees. She leaped from the seat and nearly lost her footing in the rivulets
		of water that coursed through the trees. The thick canopy of leaves did offer some shelter
		for the horses from the worst of the rain, so she figured to leave them there while she
		and Rebecca made a dash for the soddy. Clutching the side of the wagon to keep her feet,
		Josie held out her free hand to Rebecca to help her from the wagon. "Come on,"
		she yelled over the pounding rain, "We can come back later for what we need after the
		rain lets up!" Rebecca scrambled over the side, and reached back to make sure that
		the canvas was securely tied over their belongings. Josie grabbed her hand and pulled her
		away. "Don't worry about that now. Let's get out of this downpour."</p>

		<p>They took off for the cabin at a run and when they reached the
		door, Rebecca insisted they knock in case someone was still in residence there. It
		appeared from the outside to be deserted, but she did not want to assume that and burst in
		and frighten some poor settler. Josie humored her and gave a perfunctory knock and
		immediately opened the door. She rushed through dragging Rebecca behind her, and slammed
		the door.</p>

		<p>As Josie thought, the soddy had been deserted for some time, and
		rain fell steadily through several holes in the thatched roof. The corner closest to the
		stone fireplace was relatively dry, and they threw themselves down on the floor there,
		grateful to be out of the rain.</p>

		<p>They caught their breath from the dash to the cabin and sat
		closely together on the floor allowing their eyes to grow accustomed to the dimness so
		they could see if there was anything of use to them in the little soddy. It was a one-room
		cabin constructed solely of sod bricks. The stone fireplace was the only thing in sight
		not made of dirt. No furniture had been left by the builders of the cabin, or if it had,
		it had long ago been carried away or put to use by other needy travelers. There was no
		wood with which to start a fire, and no sign of a blanket that they could use to warm
		themselves with.</p>

		<p>They sat in silence for what seemed like a very long time but
		which in reality was probably no more than a few minutes, listening to the rain beat
		against the walls and roof of their little shelter. At last, with a little sigh, Josie
		climbed to her feet and took a few steps in the direction of the door.</p>

		<p>"Where are you going? Josie, it's pouring buckets out
		there," Rebecca exclaimed as she moved to follow the gunslinger.</p>

		<p>Both women were freezing cold and wanted nothing more than to dry
		off and warm up, but there was still work to be done, and they both knew it. Josie removed
		her gun belts and set them on a dry spot of the dirt floor. All they were doing at the
		moment was adding to the weight of her soaked britches.</p>

		<p>"We need blankets and dry clothes and some wood for a fire.
		Stay here; I'll be back as soon as I can." She frowned when she saw Rebecca stand up
		defiantly and place her hat on her head.</p>

		<p>"That's right, I'm as soaked as you are and if you're going
		to go out there, I'm going to go out there." She crossed her arms in front of her
		chest and looked up at Josie. Rebecca's green eyes burned with determination under the
		rain soaked brim of her hat. The gunslinger knew that it wasn't worth it to try and argue.
		They were both soaked through and having the extra set of hands would only help to get
		them warm and dry quicker.</p>

		<p>"All right," Josie agreed. "I'll see about getting
		some wood for a fire, and you get the blankets and clothes out of the wagon." Rebecca
		nodded, and the two of them started for the door. They stood for a moment in the open
		doorway looking out at the still teeming rain. They turned and looked at each other
		briefly and then stepped outside.</p>

		<p>They had a woefully small supply of kindling in the wagon, but it
		was way in front and would require removing all the canvas to get to it, something Josie
		didn't want to do. She made a mental note to move the wood to the rear of the buckboard
		once weather permitted and struck off into the stand of trees to look for fallen branches
		that might be somewhat protected from the rain.</p>

		<p>Rebecca fumbled with the knots in the rope that held the canvas
		down. They were swollen from the water, and she was ready to cry from frustration when
		finally the knot on one corner came loose and she was able to peel back the canvas. She
		grabbed the carpetbags containing hers and Josie's spare clothes, and shoved as many
		blankets as she could reach into each bag, then she turned and ran for the soddy. She
		returned to the wagon several times for additional supplies that they would need. The wind
		had picked up considerably while she was making her trips, and it drove the rain right
		through her clothes and into her skin like thousands of needles. By the time she returned
		from her last trip, she was chilled to the bone and too numb to do anything but sink down
		into a sodden heap on the floor.</p>

		<p>The gunslinger returned with an armful of wood covered by her
		vest, which was the only thing she could think of to keep at least some of the rain off
		the timber. She set the pile down beside the hearth and set about getting the fire going.
		She noticed Rebecca sitting in the corner, and wondered why she had not changed into the
		dry clothes she had brought in. "Rebecca, get out of those wet clothes," she
		said. "I'll have the fire going in a few minutes." She started piling the
		smaller pieces of wood in the fireplace, but stopped moving the sticks around when she
		heard no movement from her friend. "Rebecca?" Josie came closer and saw that the
		blonde was in the midst of an all over shiver. "Blazes," the gunslinger muttered
		and drew even closer to the young woman. "Come on, let's get you out of these wet
		things."</p>

		<p>"H-how'd it get so cold so fast?" Rebecca said through
		chattering teeth as her numb fingers tried to undo her shirt.</p>

		<p>"Northers. That wind comes down from the north and the
		temperature just drops through the floorboards," the gunslinger replied while
		removing Rebecca's hat and toweling the blonde hair dry. "Little early for them, but
		I guess there isn't much we can do about it." She dried Rebecca's hair as much as she
		could before using the damp towel on her own hair, trying to save the remaining towel for
		their bodies.</p>

		<p>Josie helped her peel the shirt off her soaked skin and handed
		her the dry towel. The gunslinger shivered uncontrollably for a moment, drawing her
		concern to herself for the first time. She quickly wiggled out of her clothes, the boots
		being the hardest to remove and requiring help from Rebecca. Josie laid one of the
		blankets out on the ground and sat down on it. She ignored the goosebumps that covered her
		flesh as she helped the young woman remove her clothes. Josie pulled her close and wrapped
		the remaining blanket around them, trying to generate body heat. "Once I get you
		warmed up a bit, I'll get the fire going," the gunslinger said softly as she ran her
		hands rapidly up and down Rebecca's forearms.</p>

		<p>"G-guess we'll keep the dusters under the s-seat from now
		on, huh?" She felt the strong arms wrapped around her tighten, drawing her closer to
		the warm body behind her.</p>

		<p>"I reckon. Not to mention the tent. You know I put the sack
		of oats on top of it?" Josie said in an 'I can't believe I did that' tone of voice.
		"I think before we head out tomorrow we'll re-pack the wagon." She smiled to
		herself when she felt Rebecca's body stop shivering and start to warm up.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Okay," Josie said after a few minutes, pulling herself
		out from under the blanket and tucking it in around Rebecca. "I'll get the fire
		going. Once it's warm enough, we'll worry about eating." She waited until the young
		woman nodded before moving to the clothes pile and donning her long underwear and a warm
		pair of stockings. Within minutes the fire was beginning to burn nicely. Josie added more
		logs than she normally would have, more concerned at the moment with warmth than with
		someone else spotting the smoke from the little chimney. She highly doubted that even the
		most desperate rogue would be out in the downpour if they could help it. The gunslinger
		took a moment to warm her hands up in front of the fire before grabbing Rebecca's clothes
		and moving over to the woman still wrapped up in the blanket. As quickly as she could,
		Rebecca dressed and scooted as close as she could get to the edge of the fireplace. Josie
		picked up the damp blankets and laid them out near the fire, hoping they might dry a
		little before they had to try and sleep with them.</p>

		<p>Dinner was nothing more than coffee and warmed up slices of dried
		beef, too thick to be jerky but too thin to be satisfying. Now dried, neither woman was
		interested in running out to the wagon for the rest of their staples. By unspoken
		agreement, both women were too chilled to talk or do anything else but stare at the fire
		and try to warm up. The rain had let up only slightly by the time they were ready to go to
		sleep. They placed two blankets on the ground, using them as a cushion from the cool
		dampness of the earth. Josie placed one still wet pistol between Rebecca and the fire,
		making sure she could reach it easily from her sleeping position and promising to clean it
		in the morning. There was no doubt that they would sleep close together with the damp cold
		permeating the area. She lay down and made room between her and the fire for Rebecca. The
		young woman curled up and pressed her back against the taller woman, snuggling closer when
		she felt the warm heat against her. "Ooh, you're warm."</p>

		<p>"And you're cold. Come here," Josie said, pulling her
		even closer. It was too early for bed and neither of the women were sleepy, but with
		virtually all of their things still out in the wagon, there was nothing for them to do.
		They sat in companionable silence for a while, and Rebecca began to softly hum. It made
		Josie think of an angelic voice she sometimes heard in her dreams, and she had to smile.
		Josie's chin was resting on Rebecca's shoulder, and she whispered into her ear, "Sing
		me a song, sprite."</p>

		<p>Rebecca jumped when she felt Josie's warm breath on her ear. She
		shivered, even though she was no longer cold, and felt warmth suffuse the area between her
		legs. Josie noticed the shiver, and believing that Rebecca was still cold, she wrapped her
		arms tightly around the smaller woman and asked, "Is that better?"</p>

		<p>"What?" Rebecca croaked, and the raspy sound of her
		voice surprised both of them. She cleared her throat and said, "Yes. Yes, it's better
		now, thanks."</p>

		<p>Josie relaxed her grip around Rebecca's ribcage just a bit
		thinking that perhaps she had restricted her breathing, which would explain the
		breathlessness in her voice. If she didn't know better, she might almost think Rebecca had
		been sexually aroused, such was the tone in her voice. She chided herself for projecting
		her own wishful thinking onto her innocent friend, and with a sigh, she said again,
		"How about that song?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, I can't carry a tune in a bucket," Rebecca
		protested. "Why don't I tell you a story instead? Have I ever..."</p>

		<p>"You've told me every story you know at least twice,"
		Josie interrupted. "Besides, I could hear your voice just now as you were humming,
		and it sounded like you were carrying a tune just fine."</p>

		<p>"Not to hear my mother tell it. She plays the organ in the
		church, and sings for all the church socials. I learned the words to all the songs from
		listening to her practice, but every time I tried to sing along, she would tell me to run
		along and play." Her voice was wistful as she spoke of her mother, and Josie could
		tell that even though her father treated her badly, she still missed her mother. Josie
		gave her friend what she hoped was a motherly pat on her shoulder and Rebecca turned and
		smiled at her and went on. "My mother now, she has the voice of an angel. I could sit
		for hours and listen to her play and sing. She should never have married; she could have
		done something with her life, something..."</p>

		<p>"She did," Josie said softly, "she created a
		beautiful and talented daughter, who's going to sing for me now."</p>

		<p>"All right. But remember, you asked for it." Rebecca
		sat up so she could breathe freely, and wrapped a blanket around her shoulders. Josie
		snuggled down in her own blanket, and gazed into Rebecca's face. "What would you like
		to hear? She asked.</p>

		<p>"Anything but hymns. I never had much use for the white
		man's religion, or their songs."</p>

		<p>"How about the songs of Stephen Foster? He's written some
		great ones."</p>

		<p>"Never heard of him. But if you like them, I'm sure I will
		too."</p>

		<p>Rebecca took a swig of water from a canteen she had fetched in,
		and began to sing. Josie was enraptured by the beautiful voice, and amazed that anyone
		could know so many songs. Some of them seemed familiar to her - 'Oh! Susanna', 'Old Folks
		At Home', 'Beautiful Dreamer', 'My Old Kentucky Home', 'Nelly Bly' - she could swear she
		had heard before. Josie was starting to doze off but when Rebecca started to sing 'Jeanie
		With The Light Brown Hair', her eyes opened wide and she sat up, staring open mouthed at
		the young blonde. Rebecca immediately stopped singing, and Josie grasped her by her arms
		and said frantically, "No, please don't stop!"</p>

		<p>Rebecca started over again, 'I dream of Jeanie with the light
		brown hair, borne like a vapor on the summer air. I see her tripping where the bright
		streams play, gay as the daisies along her way...' Rebecca could see tears glistening in
		Josie's eyes as she sang. Her heart ached for the pain she could see in those beautiful
		eyes. She wished she could take her in her arms and protect her from that pain as Josie
		had protected her since the day they met. She sang the last line of the song; 'I dream of
		Jeanie with the light brown hair, floating like vapor on the soft summer air.' In the
		silence following the song, she could hear Josie softly sobbing, no longer trying to keep
		the tears from flowing.</p>

		<p>Rebecca crawled to where Josie sat on the floor, and wrapped her
		arms around her, drawing her head down to her chest. Instinctively Josie tried to pull
		back, but Rebecca would not let her go. "Josie, please don't pull away from me,"
		she pleaded. "Let someone else be strong for once in your life. Do you trust
		me?" Josie could not speak, so she simply nodded. "Then tell me. Let me share it
		with you." Josie nodded again, but still did not trust herself to speak, so she held
		up her hand to indicate that Rebecca should wait. Rebecca stroked her hair, and felt her
		warm tears soaking into the cloth of her nightgown. After a few minutes the tears began to
		abate. Josie lifted her head from Rebecca's chest.</p>

		<p>"Hand me the canteen please," she asked, and Rebecca
		complied. She took a long draught and then a deep breath. "This is..." she began
		and then stopped and started over. "I've never told this to anyone before. It
		didn't...there was no one who ever cared enough to want to know."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I care Josie." To herself she thought, 'I wish I
		could tell you how much I care.' But she wasn't even sure what that meant, and so she said
		nothing more.</p>

		<p>"My father wrote for the Cherokee Phoenix, which was a
		newspaper published in both Cherokee and English, and he always said what was on his mind.
		The Cherokee were forced off of their land time after time by the government. When
		valuable gold deposits were found on tribal land the land was seized and the Cherokee
		forced to move on. No matter how god forsaken the land they were allowed to settle on, the
		whites would find something there of value and push them farther. And even when there was
		no gold on the land the railroads wanted to expand, and so they appealed to the government
		and were granted the right to build the railroads across Cherokee land. They slaughtered
		the buffalo as they went, leaving the Cherokee and other tribes to starve. My father was a
		man of peace, but he was also a Cherokee. He told the truth about what the railroads were
		doing. The tribe sent him to Washington to protest to the government to divert the
		railroads to other lands. He was not able to make any headway with the bureaucrats in
		Washington, but he did meet my mother there. Over the objections of her family they were
		married, and she moved west with him. I was born a year later." She paused to take
		another sip from the canteen and then continued.</p>

		<p>"I was fifteen when my father was killed; gunned down in
		front of me by one of the railroad's hired thugs. I saw the man clearly and described him
		to the local authorities, but because I was a child and there were no other witnesses,
		they made no effort to catch him. I knew that if my father had been white, my word would
		have been enough to convict the man." Her eyes glittered with hate as she recalled
		hers and her mothers repeated attempts to see justice done in the killing of her father.
		She looked at Rebecca's face, so full of sympathy for the innocent child that she was. She
		resumed her tale.</p>

		<p>"My mother was devastated by the death of my father. She
		moved back east to her family who were living in New York at that time, and took me with
		her. My grandmother wanted to dress me in fancy clothes and send me to finishing schools
		and debutante balls." Josie could tell by the look on Rebecca's face that she was
		having a hard time picturing her tall form in a fancy gown. "I hated it there,"
		she said bitterly. "I felt like an animal in a cage. I stayed as long as I could for
		mother's sake, but when I was sixteen I returned to the Cherokees. And in the little
		trading post town that bordered on the reservation I met Genie."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Excuse me." Josie felt a tap on her shoulder, and
		turned to a petite young woman with sparkling green eyes and light brown hair that hung
		down in ringlets. She was smiling up at her, and dimples indented both of her cheeks. Pale
		freckles were scattered over her nose and cheeks. She reminded Josie of a leprechaun. Her
		smile was contagious.</p>

		<p>"Yes?" She replied.</p>

		<p>"I wonder if you could reach that washboard down from that
		shelf up there?" the girl asked, pointing to a shelf a good foot out of her reach.</p>

		<p>"Sure," Josie answered. She walked to the shelf and
		stood on tiptoe to grasp the washboard. She presented it to the girl with a smile and a
		bow. "At your service."</p>

		<p>"Thanks," the young girl said brightly, and once again
		Josie found herself unable to resist smiling. "That's the hardest part about working
		here. Seems like nobody ever wants anything from a shelf I can reach." The girl
		ducked behind the counter where she was in the middle of putting together some supplies
		for a woman Josie recognized as the schoolteacher from town.</p>

		<p>"Afternoon, Miz Bohler," Josie said, nodding to the
		teacher. The older woman turned to her, and for a few moments the look on her face was
		blank as she tried to place this tall young woman. Then it came to her, and she grinned
		broadly.</p>

		<p>"Josie Hunter! Land sakes, you've certainly grown since I
		last saw you. I thought you had moved back east?"</p>

		<p>"I did. I...came back. Mother's still in New York." The
		teacher took Josie's hand in both of hers, and patted it in a comforting way.</p>

		<p>"I was just sick to hear about your father," the woman
		said sincerely. "He was a good and kind man. I...well, if I can do anything for you,
		you let me know." She turned her attention back to the counter where her purchases
		were all bundled and ready to go.</p>

		<p>"I will, Miz Bohler," Josie said trying hard to keep
		the quaver from her voice that usually preceded tears. She busied herself searching for
		saddle soap, which was the reason for her trip into the trading post. The teacher waved
		and smiled at Josie as she left the store. Josie waved back and then approached the
		counter, where Genie was busily rolling the string she had not needed to wrap her previous
		customer's packages back into a ball. She tucked the ball back under the counter and
		turned her attention to her only remaining customer. Josie laid the saddle soap on the
		counter. "Good thing I was here," she said smiling at the impish brunette,
		"This was on a high shelf."</p>

		<p>Genie laughed and the sound was musical to Josie's ears. The girl
		- for Josie could scarcely think of her as a woman since she had to be about her own age -
		made her forget her anger and sorrow over her father's death. Made her forget how
		miserable she was in New York. Made her forget everything, in fact, except the soft
		tinkling sound of her laughter. "It's a very good thing you were here," Genie
		agreed. "If I only sell the things I can reach, Mr. Eberhard will sure be unhappy
		when he comes back."</p>

		<p>That was what was missing, Josie realized. It had not occurred to
		her until that moment that Mr. Eberhard owned the store, and that it should be his face
		across the counter instead of the leprechaun. "Where is Mr. Eberhard?" she
		asked, although she was happier than she could possibly say that he was not there, if it
		meant having the girl wait on her.</p>

		<p>"Broke his leg," Genie said seriously. "Pretty
		bad, too. He'll be laid up for a while. He's a friend of my Pa's, and Pa offered to have
		me mind the store for him. I'm Genie Sanders." She extended her hand and Josie
		grasped it with her own. Genie's grip was firm but her hand was soft. Josie was sure her
		hand felt like cactus by comparison, and after a moment she withdrew it self-consciously.</p>

		<p>"I'm Josie Hunter," she said in reply.</p>

		<p>"Well, Josie Hunter, I think you earned yourself a handful
		of this penny candy for your help," Genie said as she removed the lid from a bin of
		lemon drops. Josie reached in and took a piece and popped it in her mouth. The candy was
		so sour it caused her to squinch up her face and half close her eyes, which made Genie
		laugh again. Josie would have been willing to stand there all day eating one candy after
		another just to hear that laugh.</p>

		<p>"Take some more," Genie said when her laughter was
		under control. Josie could not tell her that she really did not care much for the taste.
		She simply put her hand in the bin and grabbed a handful of the hard candies to please
		Genie.</p>

		<p>And that was the beginning of what was to be the most intense
		friendship either of the girls had ever known. Josie volunteered to make trips to the
		mercantile for any of her friends who needed anything. As a result she was making the trip
		to town three or four times a week, and each time she would spend more and more time in
		the company of the little imp. She helped her stock the shelves and was always there when
		something needed to be fetched from a high shelf. During the frequent gaps between
		customers they talked about anything and everything and nothing. Josie told Genie about
		her father's death, and it was one of the few times she saw a look on Genie's face that
		did not make her feel like smiling. Even before Josie was finished recounting the horror
		of the night her father was shot, Genie was beside her, with her arm around her shoulder.
		The kindness and gentleness of the girl somehow made Josie cry, and Genie pulled her head
		down to her chest and hugged her and soothed her as they both sobbed. Genie was as angry
		as Josie at the injustice that had been done. They spoke of what they would like to do to
		the killer, a lot of which involved putting things in various parts of the anatomy that
		neither of them knew first hand, but it sounded unpleasant and therefore what he deserved.
		</p>

		<p>"I wish I knew how to handle a gun, and I'd call him
		out," Josie said with bitterness in her voice. Her father had been a firm believer in
		"live by the gun, die by the gun", and he refused to have weapons in the house.</p>

		<p>"We could learn," Genie said enthusiastically. "My
		Pa has more guns than anybody, and he wouldn't miss one if we took it out to practice
		shooting."</p>

		<p>Josie smiled but shook her head. "Oh, I was just
		dreaming," she said softly. "We'd need to know more than just shooting. You have
		to be able to draw, and do it faster than the other guy. I wouldn't want to be the next
		Hunter killed by the railroad."</p>

		<p>"We can draw on each other...without bullets, of
		course," Genie said, convinced that it was possible to learn to be a fast draw
		without firing a shot. She started pacing around, intent on planning their lessons.
		"So, we'll need holsters as well as guns, and a bunch of ammunition. I'm sure Mr.
		Eberhard wouldn't mind me taking a few boxes of shells instead of money. And we can go out
		to Pa's wood lot; it's far enough away from the ranch that nobody will hear the shots, and
		there's a nice clearing there where we can set up targets. In a couple of days Mr.
		Eberhard will be back and we'll have plenty of time...."</p>

		<p>And so their plans were made. Josie made the trip to the clearing
		in the woods every day at the same time, and Genie would usually be waiting for her. True
		to her word, she was able to get two guns and holsters out of the house without anyone
		knowing they were gone, and at the end of their practice they cleaned them and stuffed the
		guns and supplies in a hollow log. Josie had a natural aptitude for shooting. Her hand was
		steady and her eye was unerring, and she seldom missed her target. As time went on, she
		was able to put several bullets so close together in her target that it almost appeared as
		if there was only one hole, until you looked closely. She also found that she could draw
		with a speed that she was certain would rival almost any man. Genie would still be pulling
		her gun from her holster when Josie had her gun out and aimed at her. Of course, it was a
		whole different kettle of fish to draw a fully loaded gun with the intent to kill someone,
		and despite her bravado, Josie was not sure she would be able to do it if the time came.
		As fate would have it, she had the opportunity to find out much sooner than she imagined,
		as Genie told her one afternoon about the horse thieves and her plan for her and Josie to
		catch them. What she didn't tell Josie was that her father had long ago forbade her from
		seeing that, as he called her, "No account half breed." She hoped that by
		showing him Josie was willing to risk her life protecting his horses he would relent and
		allow them to see each other openly. Instead Genie was killed, and the outlaw Josie Hunter
		was born.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca was unable to stop the tears from flowing down her cheeks
		as the stoic gunslinger recounted the tale of meeting and then losing her precious friend.
		</p>

		<p>Josie picked up the canteen and took a long drink of water. She
		felt once again the pain of losing Genie as keenly as if it had happened yesterday. Her
		mouth was dry, and she trembled from the emotions she had kept bottled up for so many
		years.</p>

		<p>"It sounds like she was very...special," Rebecca said
		softly. She felt a twinge of jealousy that another woman was able to carve a niche in
		Josie's heart so large that she felt the loss this strongly across all the years. Rebecca
		chastised herself for thinking that way; Genie had been robbed of her life and it was
		small of her to begrudge the girl the happy times she had with Josie. Rebecca took Josie's
		hand in hers and held it softly while running her thumb across the back of her knuckles.
		The gunslinger didn't flinch or try to pull away as she normally did, and Rebecca hoped
		that meant that Josie was feeling as close to her as she was to Josie.</p>

		<p>"She was more than special. She was..." Her voice
		trailed off. How could she tell Rebecca what Genie had meant to her? Rebecca was only a
		year or two older than Genie was when she died, and almost as innocent.</p>

		<p>Before she could think of a way of putting it that the girl would
		understand, Rebecca summed it up for her in seven words. "You must have loved her
		very much."</p>

		<p>Josie closed her eyes, and tears leaked out from behind the lids
		as she said, "More than...I could tell her. She never knew..." Josie swallowed
		to choke back the sobs that caused her chest to ache from holding them in.</p>

		<p>Josie and Rebecca had separated while Josie was talking. Seeing
		the look on Josie's face, Rebecca opened up her arms and simply said, "Come
		here." Once again the tall woman buried her face in the soft bosom of the little
		blonde, who soothed her with her soft voice and hands. "Shh, baby, it's okay."</p>

		<p>"No, it's not okay," the gunslinger said, her voice
		husky with emotion. "She died because of me, and nothing can ever make that
		okay!"</p>

		<p>"That's not true. She died because of someone else's
		greed."</p>

		<p>"She wouldn't have even been in that barn if not for me!
		Don't you see it was my need to take revenge on the man who killed my father that made her
		learn to use a gun? She thought that being right made us invincible, and I should have
		told her otherwise. I might as well have pulled the trigger myself..."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Josie that's wrong. You can't blame yourself for other
		peoples misfortunes. If she had never even met you she still might have gone to that barn
		with a gun, because that's the kind of person she was. Just because something you do
		starts something in motion doesn't make you responsible for everything that happens as a
		result of that act."</p>

		<p>"Believe what you want to," Josie said in a resigned
		voice. She sat up and looked into Rebecca's eyes. "In here," she said putting
		her fist over her heart, "I feel responsible for her death and I always will."</p>

		<p>"But..."</p>

		<p>"I can't talk about her any more," Josie cut her off
		sharply.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to argue with
		you," Rebecca said quickly. "I only wanted to understand. And to help," she
		finished softly.</p>

		<p>Josie couldn't miss the hurt tone in Rebecca's voice, and she
		wanted to reach out to the young woman, but her years of keeping people at arms length
		reasserted itself and instead she simply sat with her arms clasped around her knees.</p>

		<p>Rebecca knew better than to pursue the subject any further, but
		she still was itching to know how Josie got from being on the run as an alleged murderer
		and horse thief to being the "Terror of the Train Rails" which was the title of
		the first dime novel that featured the woman outlaw. Careful to avoid any mention of Genie
		she asked, "What happened after you jumped out of the barn?"</p>

		<p>"I became what they thought I was; a horse thief. I had to
		get as far away from there as I could, and I didn't have a horse of my own. I took a horse
		that belonged to one of Sanders ranch hands and headed for the woods. I didn't slow down
		even when I took a bullet in the arm. I knew some places where I had played as a child
		near the reservation, and I figured they wouldn't find me there. I holed up there all the
		next day, but I was afraid I would lose my arm from the gunshot wound, and I came out to
		see if I could get some medical attention. I was weak from loss of blood and lack of food.
		I guess I must have fainted, because I found myself lying on the ground, and the horse had
		run away. I thought I was heading toward the reservation, but my sense of direction was
		out of kilter, and I was actually heading back toward the Sanders Ranch."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The sun was almost gone for the day when the ranch hand spotted
		the wounded half breed lying in the dirt. A half-hour later and he would not have seen her
		and she would probably have bled to death where she lay. The horse she had taken returned
		to the ranch riderless with a good deal of blood on the reins and saddle, and all he had
		to do was follow the tracks back the way the horse had come until he found the woman. He
		smiled as he looked down at her still form, already devising ways of spending the reward
		he was sure to get from Sanders for bringing in the one that shot his daughter.</p>

		<p>He turned her over onto her back and poured some water from his
		canteen over her face to revive her. He cursed himself for coming out on foot to search
		for her, since it did not appear as if she were going to be able to get there under her
		own steam. He did not relish the idea of having to carry her all the way to the ranch,
		since she was taller than he was himself. When the water hit her she opened her eyes, but
		in the dusky gloom she did not spot him for several seconds, and by that time he had a gun
		trained on her.</p>

		<p>"I wouldn't reach for none a them guns if I was you,"
		he cautioned her. "I expect you'd be worth about as much dead as you was alive, so it
		don't make much difference to me. Dead's probably easier." Josie nodded her
		understanding and forced herself to relax back onto the ground. She would wait for an
		opportunity. The cowpoke grabbed hold of her good arm and yanked her to her feet. She was
		lightheaded and thought she might pass out again.</p>

		<p>"Please let me have a drink of your water," she
		croaked. "I promise not to try anything."</p>

		<p>"Why not," he said, but when she reached for the
		canteen with her uninjured arm, the man pulled it away. "Oh, no, I'll just hold onto
		it myself." Her thirst was so great she would have agreed to drink the water out of
		an old shoe served by the devil himself, so she simply nodded and allowed him to pour
		water down her throat. The water went a long way toward reviving her. She was careful not
		to let him see that she was strong enough to walk on her own, and instead allowed him to
		halfway support her. She needed to conserve as much of her strength as possible if she
		hoped to succeed when she made her bid for freedom.</p>

		<p>The two of them stumbled toward the ranch like a pair of drunken
		sailors. Josie made a grab for his gun when she saw the lights of the ranch come into
		view, figuring that she had a better chance against one man than the whole crew. But her
		reflexes were slow and his were not; he yanked the gun out of her reach, and immediately
		brought it back in a vicious arc that connected with her temple. She blacked out for a
		moment but his arm around her waist prevented her from falling. He half dragged her the
		rest of the way to the ranch and then dumped her in the dirt in front of the door of the
		main house. Unwilling to leave his prize alone, he yelled for Genie's father to come out
		of the house. A few moments later Sanders appeared at the door with a shotgun in his hand.
		</p>

		<p>"I got the half breed, Mr. Sanders," the ranch hand
		said proudly. Sanders eyes glittered with something akin to madness as he stared at the
		creature that had tried to snuff out his daughters life. In fact Genie was still clinging
		to life as the doctor from town worked frantically to repair the damage to her young body.
		The doctor had said it was less than a 50-50 chance that she would survive, but while
		there was hope he continued to try. Sanders decided to allow the half-breed to believe
		that she had succeeded in killing Genie as justification for the punishment that he had in
		mind for her. He stepped down from the porch and walked in a circle around Josie as she
		lay where she had been tossed like a broken toy. She allowed Genie's father to prod her
		with his toe and continued to feign unconsciousness.</p>

		<p>"Get her up on a horse boys," he said to the cowpokes
		who gathered around to watch the excitement. "The wheels of justice turn way too slow
		out here, so we're gonna string up this murdering Indian ourselves." While two of the
		men went to fetch horses two others pulled her to her feet. Sanders stood in front of her
		and grasped her chin in his hand, forcing her head up. He stared straight into her eyes,
		his own eyes filled with loathing and disgust. "You got anything to say for yourself
		before we carry out your sentence?"</p>

		<p>As twisted with hate as he was, Josie knew there was little point
		in protesting her innocence, but still she had to try. "I...loved her, Mr. Sanders. I
		didn't shoot her; I would never do anything to hurt her."</p>

		<p>"That's not the way I hear it," he spat into her face.
		Two men on horseback rode up to the little group in front of the house leading three
		saddled horses. "Tie her hands," Sanders ordered, and one of the cowhands threw
		a length of rope to one of the men who held her up. He drew her hands behind her back,
		which started her wounded arm bleeding again, and wound the rope around her wrists. When
		that was done they lifted her none too gently into the saddle and mounting their own
		horses, they waited for Sanders to lead them. "We'll take her to the Indian
		reservation," Sanders said. "I'd just as soon the sheriff didn't connect this
		hanging to me." He swung into the saddle and grasped the reins of Josie's horse and
		they made their way toward the reservation.</p>

		<p>It was full dark by the time they reached a spot that suited
		Sanders. He wished they had waited until the next morning to do this so that he would be
		able to see the agony on her face, but having come all the way out there he was not going
		to leave without completing his mission. He tied the end of a rope to one sturdy branch of
		a huge oak tree, and tossed the end with the noose over another branch. He led the horse
		under the branches of the tree and roughly pulled the noose over her head.</p>

		<p>"You might think about praying to whatever god it is you
		heathens believe in," he said with a voice full of venom. He turned his horse back
		the way they had come and gave a tug on the reins of Josie's horse. The animal was
		confused when her rider did not seem to be accompanying her and she stopped for a moment,
		but he pulled sharply on the reins again and she bolted out from under the helpless woman.
		"Let's go boys," Sanders said to his men. He was anxious to get home to see how
		Genie was doing and figured it would take the half-breed some time to die, time he did not
		have to spend.</p>

		<p>Josie could feel her field of vision begin to narrow as her body
		reacted to being deprived of air. As spots danced before her eyes, she clawed frantically
		at the secret pocket in her belt until she freed her knife, and she sawed at the rope that
		bound her wrists. It was awkward and painful, and for a few moments she feared she would
		lose consciousness before she was able to free her hands, but at last the rope fell away.
		The precious seconds required to loosen the bonds on her hands brought her even closer to
		losing consciousness. She had to fight her natural instinct to thrash and kick, as she
		knew it would only serve to tighten the loop on her neck. Her lungs screamed for air and
		her eyes widened in fear as she brought the knife up to her neck with her uninjured arm
		until the point of the knife was pushing against the rope under her chin. If she slipped
		she knew she would finish off the job Sanders had started, but she couldn't ignore her
		rising panic and she sawed franticly at the rope with no regard to what damage she might
		inflict with the knife. Darkness enveloped her completely, and she went limp, dropping the
		knife from her lifeless fingers. Seconds later, the rope, which had been sawn almost
		completely through, unraveled and released it's hold on her and she tumbled to the ground.
		The impact caused her to draw in a huge breath, and she lay there for several minutes
		gasping for air, almost unable to believe that she was alive. Her throat was raw from the
		friction of the rope and bleeding from the cuts she had inflicted on herself, but she
		smiled with satisfaction for having survived. She almost laughed when she realized that
		the rancher had strung her up virtually on top of an underground spring and within easy
		walking distance of the village. She stumbled to the fountain of water that welled up out
		of the ground and gulped the cool liquid. She splashed water on her face and neck and it
		helped to cool the heat of the rope burns. The pain in her arm reminded her that there was
		still a bullet in there that must be removed, and quickly, before infection set in. She
		knew she could rely on the discretion of the medicine elders on the reservation to keep
		her survival to themselves. Once she was able to travel, she would put some distance
		between herself and Genie's father knowing he would not hesitate to finish what he had
		started. Her heart heavy with the weight of the loss of her dearest friend, she made her
		way toward the reservation and safety.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca listened in silence as Josie recounted the events of the
		night that had so drastically altered the course of a young woman's life. When Josie fell
		silent, Rebecca found herself shaking with anger and outrage at the injustice that had
		been done to her friend. Seeing the way the outlaw huddled against the wall of the soddy
		with her face drawn in pain, compassion overrode the anger Rebecca felt, and she found
		herself crawling to where Josie sat and putting her arms around her shoulders. Josie made
		no effort to move away, and in fact she lowered her head to Rebecca's breast and relaxed.
		Not a word was exchanged, but Rebecca knew that something had changed between them that
		night. She sensed that Josie had let down the barriers that always kept Rebecca at arms
		length, and instead of shutting her out, Josie's protective walls enclosed her. As she did
		when the gunslinger was caught in one of her nightmares, Rebecca stroked Josie's ebony
		mane and she began to sing. Within minutes she could tell by the rhythmic breathing that
		Josie had fallen asleep. She gently lowered her to the floor and then lay down beside her,
		burying her face in the crook of the taller woman's neck. She released a soft sigh of
		contentment and quickly fell asleep.</p>
