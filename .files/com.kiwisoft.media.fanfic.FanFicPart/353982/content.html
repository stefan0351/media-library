<!-- The Closet \ Part Twelve -->

<p>"Are you serious?" Sam asked barely able to control the laughter that
was bubbling up inside of her.  The visuals she was getting from
Brooke's story were almost too much for even her not to bust out
laughing at.  </p>

<p>"Perfectly," Brooke responded smiling.  "Raspberry Kool-aid.  I had
seen them do it on some show, probably Saved by The Bell or something
equally retarded.  The minute Dad saw it he made me march up stairs
and was it out of my hair…but I'm telling you, for about half an hour
there I was a living legend.  Gem never looked so good," she continued
smiling broadly.</p>

<p>Sam smiled back at her contentedly.  "You know what I always wanted?"
Sam started in rather wistful tone.  "A tree house.  In like every
family show or children's novel they always had these kids in
tree-houses.  It was like a staple of American society and I always
resented not having one."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you build one?" Brooke asked curiously, tilting her head
to observe Sam.</p>

<p>"Where?" Sam asked.  "One of the palm trees at the beach?" she
continued.  "That's another thing.  Have you ever been skiing?  I
always wanted to go skiing.  Snow, and Yule logs and eggnog around a
fire are more staples."</p>

<p>"We should go to Colorado for Christmas this year," Brooke replied
thoughtfully.  She could picture Sam all bundled up, holding a cup of
hot something-or-the-other while being bathed in gentle glow of a
fire.  The image made something flutter inside of her, gave her a
warm, happy feeling.  "There's enough snow there for a life time of
memories," she continued before pausing for a moment, then smiling.
"I'll teach you what a snow job is."</p>

<p>"Nice try," Sam said shooting Brooke an exasperated look, "but I've
heard of those."  Brooke shrugged her shoulders in defeat.  "Aspen?"
Sam asked a second later.</p>

<p>"Where else?" Brooke asked in a way that gave Sam the distinct
impression that she wasn't joking.  To her surprise, and if she were
honest to her amusement, she discovered that she found it inordinately
cute.</p>

<p>"You're such a preppy," was what she said in response however as she
shook her head.</p>

<p>"Back to your tree house," Brooke said deciding to get the subject off
of her preppiness before they ended up bitching at each other again,
"there were other options you know."  She was enjoying talking to Sam,
in fact she was enjoying talking to Sam more than she had enjoyed
talking to anyone in a long time and she didn't want the mood in the
room to shift.  She found that being trapped in the closet lead to a
pleasant fiction, a story where she and Sam were friends.  She liked
it.</p>

<p>"Such as?" Sam asked looking at Brooke expectantly.</p>

<p>"Cardboard boxes, they're always good, sometimes even better than what
came inside of them.  My personal preference was Maytag, very durable.
 You could have built yourself a small village," Brooke responded, a
nostalgic smile spreading across her face as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Did your Dad suddenly come into money a few years or something?" Sam
asked smiling at Brooke cheekily.  Truthfully she had never pictured
Brooke as a cardboard box kind of girl, she had always kind of assumed
that Brooke would have been one of those My Little Ponies, or Barbie
girls, with the house and pink convertible.  In fact, the longer they
talked the more Sam realized that she hardly knew anything about
Brooke, but that the more she found out the more she liked.</p>

<p>"Very funny," Brooke responded although she didn't seem particularly
amused.  "Even preppies have to make do sometimes," she continued
sighing a bit.  </p>

<p>"I didn't mean that in a bad way," Sam said noticing the Brooke's
defeated tone.  "It's actually kind of," she began to say but she
stopped herself.  The truth was she found Brooke's sporadic displays
of preppiness to amazing cute, but she had just begun to be able to
admit that to herself and there wasn't anyway in hell that she was
going to tell Brooke.</p>

<p>"Kind of what?" Brooke asked turning to face Sam, a look of curiosity
covering her features.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Sam responded shifting uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Come on Sam…Sammy," Brooke began testing the nickname out and
deciding that she liked it.  "You can't just 'nothing' that.  You were
far beyond the 'nothing' line, you've gotta tell," Brooke teased as
she bobbed her body around excitedly.</p>

<p>"You pulled that rule outta your ass rather quickly," Sam replied,
still shifting about.  "I think we've discovered your superpower: the
ability to produce copious amounts of bull-shit is a single bound." </p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, then turned away from Sam before
lulling her head to the side and muttering resignedly, "And we were
getting along so well."</p>

<p>Sam turned to watch the blonde after she spoke, the silence that now
covered the room ringing in her ears painfully.  She hadn't intended
to, she didn't really want, she had only meant to…she had screwed up
and she knew it.  "I'm sorry," she said finally.  She didn't want
things to end like that because Brooke was right, they had been
getting along so well.</p>

<p>"Are you?  Really?" Brooke asked wearily turning to face her.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam responded softly but adamantly.  "It's a coping mechanism,
I didn't mean it."</p>

<p>"I don't either, those things I've said to you…I never really meant
them, it was just a reaction.  I never hated you, in fact," Brooke
paused there gathering courage, "in fact I always kinda found you
interesting."</p>

<p>"Really?" Sam asked, her surprise showing in her voice.  Brooke
McQueen had always kind of found her interesting, that was new, new
and greatly appreciated.  The reality of the situation was that with
what had happened since they had come into the closet, and with the
way Sam was feeling, she knew she wouldn't have been able to keep up
her façade of  Brooke hating for much longer.  But, if Brooke found
her interesting, that meant that there was a chance that this truce
they had entered into could be continued, and Sam would take being
Brooke's friend over being nothing but a nuisance to the girl any day.</p>

<p>"Amazingly," Brooke replied.  It was now her turn to shift
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"We should have done this before.  Talked I mean," Sam said as she
leaned her head back to rest against the door.</p>

<p>"Why didn't we?" Brooke asked.  Sam wasn't sure whether the question
was asked rhetorically or not, but she had an answer, and after
Brooke's little revelation she decided it would only be far to share
it.</p>

<p>"I think I know," Sam replied, her voice threaded with mystery.</p>

<p>"Don't be a drama queen.  Spill it," Brooke responded lazily turning
her head to face Sam.</p>

<p>"You're a bit of a gossip aren't you?" Sam asked.  "Anyway, I think
the reason was that I feared that if I got to know you I would like
you, and if I liked you I wouldn't have been able to actively hate
you, and if I was forced to stop viewing you as Satan the world as I
knew it would have collapsed in on itself, leaving me broken and
bewildered.  Outfits I would rather not have worn." </p>

<p>Brooke was silent for a moment, contemplative before finally saying,
"You say the sweetest things."   She then looked down at her lap where
her attention remained focused for a few moments before continuing
with, "but seriously, I'm glad that you've gotten past the actively
hating thing.  Besides, red has never really been my colour."  </p>

<p>They sat in silence for a long time after that, both watching each
other covertly until Brooke finally broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me now?"</p>

<p>"Tell you what?" Sam asked looking over at the cheerleader.</p>

<p>"What you find my preppiness to be kind of.  I know you thought that
you had distracted me with your charm, and I admit that telling
someone you no longer consider them to be a creature of pure evil
would have worked on most mere mortals, but I'm on to you," Brooke
answered meeting Sam's gaze.</p>

<p>"No."  And Sam said no more than that.  She knew that the subject was
a slippery slope and she was just willing to take a slid.  Brooke was
just going to have to get over it.</p>

<p>"Fine," Brooke responded with a sniff.  "I'm just going to read your
boyfriends notes then…to give you time to reflect on your
anti-socialness," she continued reaching out and picking up the manila
folder which had been resting beside Sam.  Placing it on her lap she
opened it up and licked the tip of her index finger before she began
to leaf through the sheets of paper.</p>

<p>"He's not my boyfriend," Sam muttered as she watched Brooke take
possession of her notes.</p>

<p>"You really should be ashamed of yourself.  I know that younger men
are in these days but, really," Brooke responded shaking her head
sadly.  "Sammy,"  she added shaking it some more to make sure she got
her point across.</p>

<p>"Shut up."</p>

<p>"Give me your notes so I can piece this conspiracy together," Brooke
said holding out her hand.  </p>

<p>"I could make you some Cliff Notes if you're having problems," Sam
replied saucily.  Despite that however she handed her notes over
willing to do most anything to get Brooke not to question her about
her feelings on Brooke's preppiness anymore.</p>

<p>"Ha!  Oh, wait, no," Brooke responded as she accepted the papers from
Sam.  "You know, you don't look like you're reflecting to me," she
commented a moment later.  Sam gave her the stink eye and Brooke
shrugged, oh well.</p>
