<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 35: Changes -->

<P>B’Elanna inhaled deeply, taking in the scent of Seven’s unique aroma, the
lingering smell of candles long since burned out, and the musky reminders of the
many hours of lovemaking the night before. Once Opaca had cleared Seven for most
types of pleasure, the exBorg was quite eager to try them all. B’Elanna sighed.
Life was good.</P>
<P>She opened one eye and saw that the lights were up, signifying the beginning
of the dayshift, but B’Elanna had no desire to move from her present location.
She was sprawled over Seven, her face nestled on the lanky blonde’s shoulder,
her arm resting over her wife’s abundant cleavage and she had her leg resting on
top of Seven’s thigh. B’Elanna could tell by Seven’s even breathing that her
Be’nal was still deep in the arms of Morpheus. </P>
<P>She smiled, completely content, and let her hand make the journey down
Seven’s long torso. B’Elanna’s caramel colored hand was a stark contrast to
Seven’s alabaster skin. B’Elanna’s hand lingered as she traced the metal Borg
bands under her wife’s ribs, then continued her journey until her hand rested on
Seven’ bulging belly.</P>
<P>Seven didn’t move or acknowledge the touch, the former drone was exhausted,
and B’Elanna felt a smile tug at her lips. She was feeling rather smug, quite
the lover, and more than a little proud of the thorough ravishing she had given
her wife the night before. Of course, Seven had done her own share of ravishing,
as B’Elanna’s muscle were reminding her at the moment. The Klingon’s compact
body felt like her muscles had been replaced with one of the ship’s the gel
packs. Even if she had wanted to climb off of her wife, she wasn’t sure that she
could. Plus, it just felt so damn good to be with Seven.</P>
<P>She stayed there, smiling in the early morning hours, and tried to absorb the
feelings and sensations. She didn’t ever want to take her life with Seven for
granted. As she was beginning to drift back off to sleep, she heard the chime in
the outer room signaling that someone was at the door. She briefly considered
phasering whoever was it was from her present location, but decided that it
would take too much effort. She would have to get up to retrieve a phaser from
the small weapons locker at the back of her closet, and then there was the fact
that she would have to shoot through the bedroom wall and the door to hit the
offending party. Besides, she would have to wake Seven. Only her wife’s Borg
enhanced optical implant could make that shot.</P>
<P>The chime sounded again, and B’Elanna carefully extracted herself from her
wife’s embrace. At least Seven hadn’t woken up. B’Elanna grabbed her thick robe
from its peg on the wall and pulled it snugly around her athletic body and
closed the bedroom door before trotting out to the living room. She smiled as
she stepped over her crumpled uniform. Seven had ripped it off her body as soon
as the door had hissed shut the night before. A quick glance confirmed
B’Elanna’s suspicion that the seams had been completely ripped out. She lost
many tunics that way.</P>
<P>The chime sounded again as B’Elanna reached the door, and it was beginning to
irritate her. She punched the locking mechanism and put her hands on her hips as
the door opened. Her good mood suddenly disappeared.</P>
<P>"Hi, B’Elanna," Tom Paris said sheepishly. He was shifting his weight back
and forth from one foot to the other.</P>
<P>"You," B’Elanna growled as she shoved him out into the corridor. "What are
you doing here?" she demanded quietly. She turned back and closed the door then
gave Tom her complete attention. </P>
<P>"I came by to talk to you…about … well, you know," he said as he tugged at
his collar.</P>
<P>"I should kill you," B’Elanna said, her voice far too calm for Tom’s liking.
"You hit my wife, you bastard."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I wasn’t… it wasn’t my fault," he whined. "I came to apologize."
Despite his good intentions, his eyes lingered on B’Elanna. Her robe was open at
the top revealing her coffee colored skin.</P>
<P>"Keep looking at me like that and I’ll rip your eyes out and give them to
Seven for earrings." B’Elanna pulled the robe tightly closed around her
neck.</P>
<P>"Sorry," he stammered and looked at the carpeting. </P>
<P>"Just leave, Paris," she said. "And maybe I won’t have to kill you."</P>
<P>"That sounds almost like you forgive me." He lifted his head and gave her his
most suave smile.</P>
<P>B’Elanna growled and her eyes narrowed. "Look, the Doctor said you weren’t
responsible…so I am trying to cut you some slack…" She could feel her pulse
pounding as she fought to keep her hands from wrapping around his throat. "But
you don’t have any excuse now, so I am giving you fair warning… anymore crap
from you and I will take action. Klingon action."</P>
<P>"Okay," he said quietly then decided to push his luck, after all, no guts…no
glory. He just forgot that you have to keep your guts to get any glory. "Lana,"
he said as he stepped closer. "I never would have… betrayed you with that
hologram if I’d been in my right mind. You know that. You and Seven got married,
and I accept that," he said and reached for her hand. "But, I have prior
rights."</P>
<P>He got a right, a right hook.</P>
<P>"Hey!" he yelled as he stumbled back and grabbed his jaw. "What the hell was
that for?"</P>
<P>"That was for all the crap you keep putting me through," B’Elanna said
through clenched teeth. "That was because if I did what I really want to do,
what Klingon honor demands… I’d be court martialed." She backed away from him
and leaned against the wall, glad to see that no one else was in the long
hallway. "You never could leave well enough alone, could you, Tom?"</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I know you can’t really be in love with her," Tom said as he stood
just outside of her attack zone. "You love me."</P>
<P>She rolled her eyes and let out a long sigh, then rubbed her temples.</P>
<P>"You do love me, don’t you?" he asked, taking her silence for an admission of
love.</P>
<P>"Tom, you are so clueless," she finally said. She looked at him, and actually
felt sorry for him. </P>
<P>"Help me understand," he asked sincerely. "You couldn’t stand her before you
left on that mission. Now, I’m supposed to just accept that you left me for a
Borg?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna fought the urge choke him. "She is not a Borg," B’Elanna said with
dangerous calm. "As for me leaving you? Geeze, Tom. I broke up with you a
<I>month</I> before I left. We were never right for each other. You spent more
time in the holodeck than you ever did with me, and frankly, we were never in
love."</P>
<P>"Don’t say that." Tom moved closer, then stopped as she narrowed her eyes
when he reached out to touch her. "Lana, we had…have something."</P>
<P>"Tom, I thought I loved you," she said gently. "I really did. Hell, maybe on
some level I did love you. You aren’t always a complete ass. Just most of the
time."</P>
<P>"It’s part of my charm," he said with a crooked grin.</P>
<P>"I don’t want charm," B’Elanna said as she pushed off of the wall. "I love
Seven. More than I ever thought possible. She is my life, Tom. You and I had a
distraction for a while, we passed time together, and you’ll always have a place
inside my heart because of that. You helped me when we were both lost."</P>
<P>"But, I love you," he whined.</P>
<P>B’Elanna covered her eyes and sighed, then let her hand rub roughly down her
face until she bit her knuckle. She looked up at him and shook her head. "Tom, I
didn’t even know what love was when I was with you. Seven taught me what love
is. She and I are soulmates; my heart only beats because she wills it to. If I
lost her, I would die."</P>
<P>"And the baby? Was that her idea?" he asked. He was beginning to understand
that he wasn’t going to win this fight.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s whole face lit up, and Tom took a step back, shocked by the
metamorphosis he had just witnessed.</P>
<P>"It was your idea?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Our idea," she corrected. "And I have never been happier." She looked over
her shoulder, remembering the gorgeous blonde she had left sprawled naked in her
bed.</P>
<P>"I’m really sorry I hit her," Tom said sincerely.</P>
<P>"I know," B’Elanna said as she turned back to him. "That’s why you’re still
breathing," she added with a tiny grin.</P>
<P>"And the Vulcan salve…" Tom added.</P>
<P>"And the smart ass remarks?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>Tom covered his face and shook his head. "Thank you, for not killing me," he
mumbled between his fingers.</P>
<P>"You should thank Seven," B’Elanna pointed out. "She’s much more Klingon than
I’ll ever be."</P>
<P>"Really?" he asked as he looked up at her. </P>
<P>Two crewmen stepped out of the turbolift and walked toward them. B’Elanna
moved out of their path and pulled her robe tighter.</P>
<P>"Really," she said when they passed. "I had to keep her from… well, you
<I>really</I> don’t want to know what I kept her from doing. I don’t want you
having nightmares."</P>
<P>"I already am," he said quietly as he remembered the rage-filled look Seven
had in her eyes as she had threatened to assimilate him. "Are you telling me she
gets worse than she did in the holodeck?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna frowned. "She’s really upset about that, Tom. She didn’t know why
you were acting the way you did, and when she found out, it almost broke her
heart," B’Elanna explained. "If you give her any grief about it, you’ll answer
to me."</P>
<P>"She felt bad?" Tom asked incredulously. "Why? I was a complete ass."</P>
<P>"Because, Tom, she would never hurt an innocent person," B’Elanna explained.
"Once she found out that you were holo-drugged, she felt awful. She has more
honor than any person I have ever met."</P>
<P>"Guess that’s one of the reasons you love her," he admitted.</P>
<P>"One of many," she said with a smile and looked back over her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Go," Tom said. "She’s probably wondering where you are."</P>
<P>"Thanks, Tom," B’Elanna said as she turned to go back inside her quarters.
"Oh, and Tom?"</P>
<P>"Yeah?" He stopped and ran his hands through his hair.</P>
<P>"Don’t ever call on us this early again on our day off." She motioned to her
robe.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, it’s after 11:00," he pointed out.</P>
<P>"Yeah, well… we need our rest," B’Elanna said with an evil grin. "We didn’t
get any sleep last night."</P>
<P>He looked confused, then blushed. "I really didn’t need to know that," he
said as he sighed.</P>
<P>"Consider it partial payment for your asinine behavior," B’Elanna said as she
went into her quarters and locked the door. She smiled, happy with the way the
conversation had went, and turned to see a very naked Borg standing at the
bedroom door… naked and more than a little agitated. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres," Seven said as she crossed her arms over her naked chest.
"I awoke to find you gone. Then I heard you in the corridor with Tom Paris. I
did not expect to have you return dressed only in a robe."</P>
<P>"But… I… Seven," B’Elanna stuttered. She turned and pointed at the door and
then looked back at her wife. "I didn’t want to wake you," she finally managed
to say.</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven asked as she raised her Borg eyepiece.</P>
<P>B’Elanna felt panic rising inside her and then she noticed that Seven’s eyes
were sparkling and there was a hint of a smirk at the edge of the former Borg’s
full lips.</P>
<P>"Yes," B’Elanna said as she moved closer. "Besides, I didn’t think you’d mind
Tom looking at me." She opened her robe and let it fall to the floor. "Looking
never hurt anyone, did it?"</P>
<P>Seven smiled and lunged forward, grabbing B’Elanna around the waist and
pulling their naked bodies together. "If he looks at you, it will hurt him." She
kissed B’Elanna briefly then pulled back. "I am glad you have come to an
understanding with him," Seven said. "And that he was not seriously injured…by
me." </P>
<P>"I should spank you for scaring me when I came back in here," B’Elanna said
as she reached behind Seven and gave her a gentle swat on her bare skin. "How
did you know what we said?"</P>
<P>Seven raised both eyebrows in unison, not believing that her wife had even
asked the question.</P>
<P>"Oh," B’Elanna said with a smile. "Borg enhanced hearing."</P>
<P>"I will expect my earrings the next time he leers at you," Seven said as she
moved them both toward the bedroom.</P>
<P>"I was kinda’ hopping you hadn’t heard that part," B’Elanna said as she
remembered her interesting suggestion for an alternate use of the helmsman’s
eyes.</P>
<P>"Enough talk about him," Seven said. "Come back to bed. I have plans for
you."</P>
<P>"All right," B’Elanna said with an exaggerated sigh. "But after last night…
you’ve got a tough act to follow."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Seven enjoyed a good challenge. "I shall endeavor to… better my
performance from last night."</P>
<P>"Kahless, help me," B’Elanna said with a laugh, only half joking.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Kathryn Janeway walked into the arboretum and stared at the activity in front
of her. Tach had rounded up most of the off duty science officers with any
experience in botany or biology and had them working like a well-oiled army.
They were all on their hands and knees, crawling around in a field of what
appeared to be wheat, waving dermal regenerators over the tiny stalks.</P>
<P>"If I hadn’t seen it for myself, I wouldn’t have believed it," Janeway said
as she walked up behind Tach.</P>
<P>"Captain," he said with a huge smile as he turned around. "What do you
think?" he asked as he pointed to the huge expanse of wheat.</P>
<P>"Remarkable," she said. "How did you manage this?" Janeway tugged at a stalk
of wheat and rolled it between her fingers. Years on an agricultural park gave
her the experience to know that the crop was at least three months into its
growth season. As the captain of <I>Voyager</I>, she knew the crop hadn’t
existed the previous day.</P>
<P>"Dermal regenerators," he said. He held up a regenerator from one of the
dozens of emergency medical packs. "If you alter the polarity and adjust the
setting to cause new growth instead of healing old tissue, it increases the
growth of the plantlife exponentially."</P>
<P>Tuvok came over to the Captain. "At this rate, we will have a full compliment
of wheat in two days," he said succinctly. He had wheat sticking to his hair and
his trousers were wrinkled and had wheat protruding from every pocket. It was a
very unusual combination for the always perfect Vulcan whose close-cropped hair
and neatly pressed trousers usually looked like the pictures from a Starfleet
manual. The explanation came crawling up behind him.</P>
<P>"Tu-vee!" Ty yelled as he gripped the Vulcan’s legs from behind. "Tu-vee,
up!" the Narian boy demanded.</P>
<P>"The methods employed can be transferred to almost any vegetation," Tuvok
said as he scooped up Ty and settled the boy onto one hip. "We need only supply
extra nutrients for the faster growth requirements." As Tuvok spoke, he
intercepted Ty’s hands, which kept grabbing the Vulcan’s neatly trimmed
hair.</P>
<P>"Ty," Tach said sternly. "Leave the nice man alone." He reached for his son
but Tuvok pivoted away. Janeway watched with a faint smile kissing her lips.</P>
<P>"The child is merely exhibiting a healthy instinct for curiosity," Tuvok
said. He finally managed to pin one of Ty’s hands down. The other hand shot up
and traced the Vulcan’s pointed ear.</P>
<P>"Bunny," Ty said as he pinched Tuvok’s ear. "Tu-vee is a bunny."</P>
<P>"Indeed?" Tuvok said to the child. "I believe your conclusion if faulty."</P>
<P>Ty giggled and tugged harder. It was too much for Janeway and she laughed and
held her sides.</P>
<P>"I don’t think he’s quite old enough for Vulcan logic…Tu-vee," Janeway said
when she finally quit laughing.</P>
<P>"It is never too soon to begin a regimen of logic." Tuvok looked into Ty’s
dark eyes, his expression serious. "I have no fur, I do not hop, and my bipedal
stance is humanoid, therefore I cannot be a bunny," he told Ty.</P>
<P>"Bunny." Ty scrunched his face and then hugged Tuvok. </P>
<P>"Not a bunny," the Vulcan whispered and surprised Janeway when he moved his
hand up behind the child and rubbed his back.</P>
<P>"Tach," Janeway said as she turned her attention back to the adult Narian.
"This is wonderful, but why?"</P>
<P>"You’re transporting my family and I a great distance," Tach explained. "We
pull our own weight."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Janeway said sincerely. "This is more than enough payment. The
expenditure of dermal regenerator energy is minuscule compared to the amount of
replicator rations it would take to create this much wheat. And, all of these
plants will give us some well needed fresh oxygen."</P>
<P>"I am glad my experience is helpful," Tach said. "But the dermal regenerator
was Seven’s idea. She’s quite a farmer."</P>
<P>"Evan!" Ty yelled and he pulled away from Tuvok. "Where Evan?"</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is not here. We are merely discussing her achievements," Tuvok
said as he shifted Ty to the opposite side. He sensed from Ty’s abundant amount
of squirming that he wanted down. As soon as Ty was on the decking, he crawled
off toward his father with incredible speed.</P>
<P>Ty paused and looked up with questioning eyes at his father, wondering if
Seven was somewhere nearby. Tach shook his head and Ty scrambled off toward the
wheat when he saw Samantha Wildman crawl out of the growing field.</P>
<P>"Seven came up with this?" Janeway asked. "I never pictured her as being…
agriculturally inclined." Kathryn began to wonder if she understood the former
drone at all. She had never pictured Seven with children or in a
non-technological setting. Maybe Seven’s growing family would be happy living on
a farming planet with Tach, Nara and Ty.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is a resourceful individual," Tuvok said as he attempted to
pick the wheat out of his uniform. Most of the offending grain had been shoved
into his trousers by Ty; he saw the dark skinned officer as his own personal
play toy.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," Janeway agreed. "Tu-vee."</P>
<P>Tuvok looked unaffected, but Janeway saw a slight darkening of the skin
around his ears. It was subtle, but Janeway caught it. It was the Vulcan version
of a blush.</P>
<P>"I must check on the progress," Tach said and excused himself and went into
the wheat field.</P>
<P>"You’re very good with him," Janeway said to Tuvok as she nodded toward Ty.
"Isn’t he about the same age as your grandson?"</P>
<P>"My grandchild is almost one year older." Tuvok looked at the dark haired
child. "Despite his lack of logic, Tyralanar is incredibly intelligent. His
features are similar to early Vulcans."</P>
<P>"Tyralanar?" Janeway asked, then smiled. "Oh, you mean Ty. Yes, he is a
bright boy, and he’s taken quite a shine to Seven and B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Further proof of his intelligence," Tuvok said as he gave up trying to get
the wheat off of his trousers.</P>
<P>"Why Tuvok, that’s down right...sentimental of you," Janeway teased. "I’ve
never heard such glowing comments coming from you."</P>
<P>"I see no reason to insult me," Tuvok said as he tried unsuccessfully to
smooth his hair. Janeway smiled and picked a stalk of wheat from the top of his
head.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna was laying on her back with her arms beside her head and her
breathing came in deep gasps. She was shaking from head to toe, unable to move
beyond the muscular twitches racking her body, but there was a lazy smile
plastered across her face.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna said. "Wow... Seven, wow."</P>
<P>Seven crawled out from under the blankets and kissed B’Elanna’s stomach as
she moved up and rested her face on her wife’s chest, listening to the out of
control pounding.</P>
<P>"Wow..." B’Elanna repeated without opening her eyes.</P>
<P>"You all already said that," Seven pointed out with a smug grin. "Be’nal,
have you lost the power of speech?"</P>
<P>"Uh huh," B’Elanna responded, still unable to lift her arms. Her body was
covered with a thin sheen of sweat and she was certain that her bones had
melted.</P>
<P>"You are shaking," Seven observed. "Are you cold?"</P>
<P>"Nuh uh," B’Elanna grunted. </P>
<P>"Be’nal, are you all right?" Seven sat up and studied her wife.</P>
<P>"Uh huh," B’Elanna said as her smile widened. "Wow."</P>
<P>"Did I better my performance from last night?" Seven asked unnecessarily. She
reached over her wife and grabbed a glass of water from the nightstand.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna responded, drawing the word out into several syllables.</P>
<P>"I think you are dehydrated," Seven observed. "Drink some of this."</P>
<P>"Can’t move," B’Elanna said with a happy sigh.</P>
<P>Seven shifted her weight and lifted B’Elanna’s head from the pillow. The
Klingon seemed to have lost her spine and her head flopped over Seven’s arm.
After some maneuvering on the exBorg’s part she managed to get the glass to
B’Elanna’s lips. </P>
<P>"Mmm," B’Elanna mumbled after she took several long gulps. "Wow." B’Elanna’s
eyes had yet to open.</P>
<P>"I believe that I may have burned out some of your synaptic relays," Seven
said cautiously. "Should I call Opaca?"</P>
<P>"Nuh uh," B’Elanna mumbled. One eye opened with extreme effort and B’Elanna’s
smile brightened when she saw Seven. The exdrone’s hair was down, out of its
braid and flowing wildly around her bare shoulders. "You... I... wow," B’Elanna
said and then flopped back onto the pillow and began giggling.</P>
<P>"This is a new reaction," Seven said as she settled next to her wife. "I
am... concerned."</P>
<P>"Don’t be," B’Elanna said as she finally raised one hand and flopped her arm
over Seven’s back. "I feel... wonderful." She took a deep breath as her body had
a strong aftershock. "Sweet Kahless," B’Elanna added with a sigh.</P>
<P>"Kahless had nothing to do with it," Seven said in Borg monotone.</P>
<P>B’Elanna giggled and tried to squeeze her wife but her arm didn’t have any
strength.</P>
<P>"Wow?" Seven asked as she kissed B’Elanna’s cheek.</P>
<P>"Wow," B’Elanna confirmed with a wicked smile.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Captain Janeway headed toward the mess hall, still smiling as she pictured
Tuvok holding the Narian boy. For a supposedly emotionless man, he managed to
show a great deal of caring for the child. Kathryn thought about the wheat and
hoped that Neelix would be able to make some bread that wasn’t too...Talaxian.
She wanted good old-fashioned yeast bread, warm from the oven, not some bizarre
creation with leela root or hot peppers that hid the flavor of the grain.</P>
<P>The doors to the mess hall opened and Janeway was surprised to see the entire
room packed. Everyone was clamoring to get to the kitchen area. Usually,
crewmembers were all too willing to let others cut in front of them...anything
to delay trying Neelix’s latest delicacy. She inhaled deeply and understood why
they were fighting for the meal in question. Whatever in was, it smelled
divine.</P>
<P>"Captain," Chakotay called from a table off to one side.</P>
<P>She made her way to him through the cramped room and smiled at him. "Quite a
crowd. Usually more of the crew decides to use their replicator rations."</P>
<P>"Not if they tasted this," he said as he poked his fork into a tender piece
of meat surrounded by vegetables and a thin broth.</P>
<P>"Is that corned beef?" Janeway asked. Her mouth began to water. She hadn’t
had decent corned beef since she was back on Earth in her mother’s kitchen.</P>
<P>"Well," Chakotay said. "It’s not actually corned beef, but it’s close. Nara
chased Neelix out of his kitchen this afternoon and whipped up a Narian herbed
beef recipe." He took a bite, savoring the flavor, then spoke with his mouth
full. "It’s a lot like corned beef, only a little more garlicky."</P>
<P>"I think I’ll go grab a plate," Janeway said. She stared at the commander’s
plate, noticing the way the potatoes and carrots looked just like her
mother’s.</P>
<P>"I’d use your captain’s privilege to cut to the front of the line," he said
with a smile. "There might not be any left when you get up there."</P>
<P>"Then I’ll come back and commandeer yours," she said with a smirk. She
reached down and took one of his carrots and headed off to get her own meal.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven and B’Elanna walked hand in hand into the mass hall. They paused when
they saw the crowded room.</P>
<P>"Perhaps Mister Neelix’s cooking finally killed someone," Seven said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed and tugged Seven closer. She wrapped her arms around the
willowy blonde and kissed Seven’s neck under her ear. "I love you, my
Be’nal."</P>
<P>"You are still under the effects of the ‘wow’ phenomenon," Seven
whispered.</P>
<P>B’Elanna blushed and nodded her head. "Oh, yeah," the Klingon said.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, over here," Tach yelled from a table at the back of the room.</P>
<P>Seven led her wife through the crowd until they found their friend. "Good
evening," Seven said formally.</P>
<P>"Have a seat," Tach said. "Nara and Ty will be right over."</P>
<P>Janeway came over with her tray and smiled at the couple. "Lieutenant, Seven,
nice to see you could join us." She sat down and dug into her meal with gusto.
"Oh my," Janeway exclaimed. "I didn’t know replicated meat could taste this
good."</P>
<P>B’Elanna inhaled, and looked curiously at the captain. "Did Neelix talk Nara
out of her recipe?"</P>
<P>"Doubtful," Seven said. She smiled as she felt B’Elanna move around behind
her and then felt her Klingon wife’s hands wrap around her from behind. The
familiar warmth on her belly made her sigh and lean back into her shorter
spouse.</P>
<P>Janeway was eating as fast as she could and still be considered an elegant
Starfleet captain. "Apparently Nara took over the kitchen. If this is the
result, I may kidnap your wife for good," the captain told Tach.</P>
<P>B’Elanna kissed Seven’s neck, still reeling from her earlier lovemaking
session. "Sit, love. I’ll go get you a plate." B’Elanna guided Seven onto the
bench and then paused long enough to give her a lingering kiss. "Don’t go
anywhere, Be’nal," she added as she caressed Seven’s cheek.</P>
<P>Seven smiled and glanced down at the table. When she did look up, Tach was
grinning at her with his eyes sparkling. It did not bode well for Seven.</P>
<P>"Finally decided to get out of bed?" Tach asked.</P>
<P>Janeway choked on her herbed beef.</P>
<P>"I believe Nara would enjoy a little more time in that particular location,"
Seven shot back. "You might ask the captain if you can borrow a uniform. Nara
finds B’Elanna quite handsome in hers."</P>
<P>Janeway took a gulp of her coffee and felt her cheeks burning bright red.</P>
<P>"If memory serves," Tach said as he stirred his coffee, "You find her quite
handsome out of uniform."</P>
<P>"Your memory is flawless," Seven said with a smirk. "Captain, are you all
right?" She turned to Janeway who was a having a coughing fit.</P>
<P>"Yes," Janeway said as she managed to stop coughing. "Fine. Seven, you are
looking well."</P>
<P>"I am feeling much better. Thank you, for noticing," Seven said. She smiled
when she saw B’Elanna coming back balancing two trays. "Thank you, Be’nal," she
said as she took a tray from her wife.</P>
<P>"You’re welcome." B’Elanna put her tray next to Seven’s and then straddled
the bench next to Seven and sat facing her. She pulled something out of her
jacket pocket and held it hidden in her hand. "Close your eyes," B’Elanna
ordered as she lifted it toward her wife’s mouth.</P>
<P>Seven raised her eyebrow, but did as she was told and took a bite of the
treat. Her eyes opened wide and she moaned. "Honey nut cakes," Seven mumbled
around the cookie. She took another bite. Her eyes were locked with B’Elanna’s
the entire time.</P>
<P>"Thought you’d like that," B’Elanna whispered. She reached down and rubbed
the former drone’s belly. "I know the little one craves sweets."</P>
<P>Nara came out of the kitchen carrying Ty. The small boy saw his aunts and
squealed.</P>
<P>"Ba! Evan!" He held his arms out and almost leaped into B’Elanna’s hands. She
settled him into front of her, almost on top of Seven, and ran her hand through
his hair.</P>
<P>"Have you had dinner, Ty?" Seven asked the child.</P>
<P>He nodded but reached for her plate. "Bicket," he requested.</P>
<P>"Chew it well." Seven smiled and broke off a corner of her biscuit and handed
it to him. He stuffed the entire piece into his mouth and put his hand out for
more.</P>
<P>"Hey, Tiger, let my wife get some dinner. She needs her energy," B’Elanna
said as she kissed the top of Ty’s head.</P>
<P>"I’m betting you burned up quite bit of her energy already," Nara said as she
sat next to Tach.</P>
<P>Janeway pushed her plate away. If she continued trying to eat around the
Narian’s and her crewmembers, she would certainly choke to death. </P>
<P>"B’Elanna, don’t you get hot wearing that jacket all of the time?" Janeway
asked, trying to change the subject to something that didn’t involve B’Elanna
and Seven’s very active sex life.</P>
<P>"I only wear a tank top under it," B’Elanna said as she spun to sit facing
the table. Ty wiggled, content on her lap. "I guess I like feeling the weight of
it. I feel naked without it."</P>
<P>Tach started to comment, but a well placed elbow from Nara made him change
his mind. Nara leaned forward. "B’Elanna, Seven, we’ve been thinking about
something."</P>
<P>"And?" Seven looked over at her friend and put her fork down. Ty grabbed it,
but B’Elanna disarmed him before he could do any real damage.</P>
<P>"Tach’s brother left us his homestead. There are only 10,000 settlers on our
planet. It’s a solitary life and he wasn’t cut out for it," Nara explained. "His
land backs up to ours. It’s yours if you want it."</P>
<P>B’Elanna and Seven said nothing, then looked at each other. They exchanged
glances for a moment as if speaking telepathically. Janeway held her breath as
she waited for them to answer.</P>
