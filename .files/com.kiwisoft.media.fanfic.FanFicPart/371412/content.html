<p>A/N: Heh, remember when I said I wasn't sure if my new job would affect my writing time? Turns out, A LOT. I've been nothing but exhausted these past few weeks. It was very hard to find any motivation to write lately. But I managed to write a little something something for ya. Hope you like it, even if its short :)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>The real Sebastian merrily made his way to his assigned room, completely oblivious to the mess waiting for him. He quickly tried the door to find that it was open and ready for him so he let himself in, thinking luck was on his side when it was more like unluckiness trying to hurry up the process. The first thing to catch Sebastian's attention was another guy in the room sitting at a desk staring off into space.</p>
<p><i>'Must be my roomate'</i>, Sebastian surmised and began to introduce himself amiably. "Hey, I'm-"</p>
<p>"Oh my god, bro, you would not believe what I just saw outside!" Duke exclaimed, interrupting Sebastian's attempt at an introduction.</p>
<p>"Uhhh..." Sebastian uttered in confusion.</p>
<p>"Dude, I'm talking about Olivia and.." Duke did a double-take when he finally looked at Sebastian. "Who the hell are you?" he immediately questioned. Sebastian let out a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>"Um, I'm Sebastian Hastings." he answered awkwardly.</p>
<p>"No you're not. Sebastian is a couple of inches shorter than you, a bit scrawnier and not nearly as masculine as you." Duke informed him, standing up from his chair in a threatening manner.</p>
<p>"... Huh..?" was all Sebastian could say. You know that moment when you're trying to feel out your new roommate to see if they're crazy or not? Well, Sebastian was getting the reading that his roommate was completely off his rocker. "I'm sorry, but who are you?" Sebastian questioned.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna kick your ass, imposter!" Duke exclaimed. Turns out that seeing two girls he was hot for making out together can really fire a guy up into violence. Sebastian could do nothing while he was shoved out of the room and had the door slam on his face.</p>
<p>"What the hell?" Sebastian said nasally since he was clutching his poor nose that had a violent encounter with the door. He glanced up and down the hallway in bewilderment. Maybe he had the wrong room..? But wishful thinking did him no good when extra checking resulted in the fact that this was indeed his assigned room. Just him and a crazy roommate who thought he was supposed to be less manly. So much for luck.</p>
<p>Olivia was happy.</p>
<p>"Mmmm... that feels really good, Olivia."</p>
<p>Inexplicably happy.</p>
<p>"Try to be a bit nicer, will ya?"</p>
<p>"Oh sorry, like this?"</p>
<p>"(gasp) Oh yeah, that's the way to do it!"</p>
<p>She was finally happy to get her hands on Viola and work her into submissive bliss...</p>
<p>"Damn Olivia! (moan) If I didn't know any better I'd say that you've done this before!"</p>
<p>"You're my first, believe it or not."</p>
<p>"That so? I wouldn't have it any other way..."</p>
<p>-CRACK-</p>
<p>"AAAHHHHHH! OH MY GOD, MY BACK!"</p>
<p>"Omigawdomigawd! Are you okay! I didn't mean to do that! I'm sorry! I was overeager, I couldn't help it!... Viola? Viola! Answer me! VIOLA!"</p>
<p>"I'm alive, stop shaking me..."</p>
<p>"Oh thank god, I thought I killed you!"</p>
<p>"I think I just need to lay here for a little while... and recover..."</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry! I didn't have any experience and now this happens."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it... I know massages can be tricky sometimes..." Viola groaned in pain. Olivia was sitting next to her prone body on the bed, looking on helplessly as Viola twitched a bit. She must have hit a nerve or something while she was attempting a massage on Viola. She was just trying to help for the big game against Cornwall tomorrow!</p>
<p>"I think I'm starting to regain the feeling in my body." Viola mumbled. Olivia leaned over her protectively.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should just sleep? I know the game means a lot to you and you should rest." Olivia suggested. Viola nodded her head a bit into Olivia's pillow and smirked.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to see the look on my ex's face when I kick his ass in soccer." she muses with a contented sigh. Olivia breathed in relief that Viola didn't seem in pain anymore and settled her body next to her on her tiny bed. For once she is thankful for the small size of her dorm resulting in the tight fit she was enjoying so much. Viola scooted over and snuggled into Olivia's side, making the blonde's face go red.</p>
<p>"I, I guess you can move completely now?"</p>
<p>"Mmmhm." Viola replied. The soccer player's hands found themselves wandering Olivia's abdomen. "I'm feeling all right now." Viola's voice got a bit seductive and she went in for a kiss to which Olivia eagerly responded to. Maybe a bit too eager.</p>
<p>-CRACK-</p>
<p>"MY BACK!"</p>
<p>"I'M SORRY!"</p>
<p>Sebastian slouched miserably on the bench outside the boy's dorm. He didn't exactly fancy the idea of returning to his room with his wacko roommate, so here he was looking like on a homeless bum about to nap on a campus bench. Maybe he should've stuck to London...</p>
<p>"Two-thousand one, two-thousand two, two-thousand three..." A strange looking girl moonwalked in front of the bench, bewildering Sebastain for a moment further when she sat down next to him. "Nice night, isn't it?" Eunice asked, scooting uncomfortably close to the boy.</p>
<p>"Ugh, sure." Sebastian responded awkwardly. "I'm gonna have to like it since I got kicked out of my room." Sebastian added to himself. Eunice plastered herself to Sebastian's side, making him jump and nearly squeal in fright.</p>
<p>"I never had a roommate before." she breathed creepily into his ear before she layed her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"... Eh?" Sebastian looked horrified. But it was already too late since Eunice had quite the grip on his arm as she dragged him away mercilessly to her room. After struggling up a couple of staircases Sebastian had finally resigned himself to the fact that he wanted to sleep in a bed that night. Well, at least he was HOPING for sleep. He had a feeling he would keeping himself awake to watch out for Miss Creepy-Thang... Scary stuff.</p>
