I'd also like to thank those who have already reviewed the first chapter of this story, please feel free to review this chapter too!</p>
<p>Lily's thoughts are in italics</p>

<p>Lily tapped her foot impatiently on the elevator's tiled floor; these contraptions took forever to get anywhere, although in this particular situation Lily wasn't really looking forward to her destination.</p>
<p><i>I'm going to tell, I'm going to tell her, I'm going to tell her. It's the only way, to stop Miley from making the mistake of marrying Jake, and to stop my mistake of losing her. I have to do this.</i></p>
<p>Lily tried taking deep breaths to slow her racing heart, the door chimed open and she stepped out of the elevator and walked down the hall at a very slow, steady pace.</p>
<p>"Well lookie here, Lily you look prettier than a Miss Tennessee beauty pageant winner," Dolly exclaimed when she saw the lovely Lily.</p>
<p>"Oh hah…thanks Dolly. I heard Miley wanted to see me?" Lily replied, desperately hoping she could hold herself together in front of Miley.</p>
<p>"Well she does want to speak to you but she's refusing to see anyone before the wedding. After I helped her get into her dress she insisted she wanted to be alone till it was time for Robby Ray to escort her down the aisle," Dolly corrected and then left Lily outside Miley's door as she went down to greet the wedding guests.</p>
<p><i>I can do this. I just need to tell her how I truly feel.</i></p>
<p>Lily hesitantly raised her fist and knocked lightly on the hotel room door, she heard hurried footsteps approach the door on the other side.</p>
<p>"Lily?" Miley called out.</p>
<p>"I'm here Miley, you wanted to speak to me?" Lily responded.</p>
<p>"Lily, you're my best friend and I trust you more than anyone, I need you to tell me something."</p>
<p>"What is it?" Lily asked with trepidation.</p>
<p>"Am I doing the right thing, marrying Jake? He's good to me, he's liked me since middle school, he's very…sweet," Miley said in a nervous tone.</p>
<p><i>I should tell her now, it's the perfect moment, she seems unsure of the wedding; I can save her from this horrible mistake. </i></p>
<p>"And, I – love him, of course," Miley added quickly when Lily remained silent, lost in her thoughts.</p>
<p>"Love, love him?" Lily inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>It was a moment of hesitation, but Miley finally responded with a firm, "yes."</p>
<p><i>No…no, no, no! She loves him, she wants to be with him, I can't do this, I can't hurt her with my wants and needs. I love her so damn much but she belongs with whoever can make her happy, and that's Jake. Miley and I aren't meant to be, I'm just the best friend, but we're not going to end up together in the end. There's no happy ending to this story.</i></p>
<p>"Miley, Jake makes you happy, you should be with the one who can make you happy, that's love," Lily said with a heavy heart, reassuring her best friend while regretting every word that came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Thanks Lily, you always make me feel better. Can you send my father up, I'm ready to pump up this wedding," Miley laughed, trying to quiet her wedding day jitters.</p>
<p>"Anything for you Miley," Lily replied in a monotone voice, all energy drained from her.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade>Lily walked down the hall to the elevators and rested her forehead against wall above the elevator button waiting for the stupid thing to get all the way to the 27th floor.</p>
<p>"Why does this have to hurt so damn much?" Lily pondered out loud.</p>
<p>"Hit your head or something Lilly?" Robby Ray asked as he stepped out of the elevator.</p>
<p>"No I – just, my contacts are hurting my eyes, too much contact solution I guess," Lily sniffed.</p>
<p>"So that's why you're crying? Come on Lily, give me a little more credit, I'm not that oblivious. Did you and Miley get into a fight or something?" Robby asked the visibly upset lass.</p>
<p>Lily looked up into the face of the man that had always treated her fairly, always tried to help out, and she broke down, "I love her Mr. Stewart, I love Miley and I've lost her, to Jake, of all people. She's going to go marry that bastard and she'll never know how I feel. I'm in love with Miley, but it doesn't mean a thing."</p>
<p>"Well I guess fathers don't know best, I had no idea Lilly, wish you had told me sooner, would have saved me the load of dough I spent on Miley's wedding dress," Robby Ray told the perplexed girl.</p>
<p>"What are you saying?" Lily asked him.</p>
<p>"You expect me to believe that you're going to let Miley marry the wrong person? Lily, you've always been there for my daughter, I know you care about her, and I can see that you love her, so what are you waiting for? I'll go downstairs and inform the guests that the wedding is off while you do what you need to do," Robby Ray smiled at Lily.</p>
<p>"Mr. Stewart, Jake makes Miley happy, that's all that matters, your little girl is going to have a great life with her husband and a family, if she was with me, she couldn't have that," Lily reminded the hillbilly sadly.</p>
<p>"What makes you think you and Miley couldn't have a family? Just because it's not a man and a woman and a child, doesn't make it any less of a family. Why look at my family, just a man and his two children who all love each other regardless," Robby Ray put a hand on Lily's shoulder, trying to comfort the girl.</p>
<p>"I appreciate what you're trying to do, but we both know the truth. Miley wanted me to come get you so you can walk her down the aisle, she's ready to be married, she wants a future and a family with Jake. I'm going to go down there and take my place in the bridal procession. I'll see you and Miley down there in a bit. I bet she looks amazing in her dress; she wouldn't let me see her though. Mr. Stewart, can you just, tell her she looks beautiful, for me, please? She always looks so beautiful," Lily said sadly. She stepped into the elevator and punched the L button for lobby, or in Lily's case, the end of her hopes and dreams.</p>
