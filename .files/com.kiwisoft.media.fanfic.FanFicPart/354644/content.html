<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 22 -->

<p>While David called Albert, Giles went into the lounge where Xander,
Buffy and Willow sat and explained what was going on.</p>

<p>"Do you really will send the other Slayer?" Buffy asked her Watcher.</p>

<p>"It would be foolish for them if they didn't. This danger is greater
than any other ever faced." Giles told them. The fact that he and Buffy had
defied the Council shouldn't preclude aid when it was needed. David entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Well, I called Albert and he'll put it to the Council tomorrow. He'll
let me know then." informed David.</p>

<p>"Fine, in the mean time we need to start planing.  David you can
start... " Giles started to say but David cut him off.</p>

<p>"No, no, no. You guys are gonna have to make all the plans without
this little black duck. I'm jet lagged to the shit house, so I'm off to bed.
I recommend you guys do the same. Once we know if we have the other Slayer,
then we can start planning. Ok?" David turned and went upstairs to bed.
Xander also got up.</p>

<p>"Just where do you think you are going?" Giles demanded to know.
Xander looked at him.</p>

<p>"The man has got a point. I'm heading for the kitchen for a snack,
then I'm hitting the hay G-man." Xander said and left. Giles just sighed.</p>

<p>"Fine. We'll do this tomorrow."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Willow woke at dawn. Gently she untangled herself from Buffy's embrace
and softly padded down the stairs to the entertainment room. She stopped at
the door.</p>

<p>She could see David was watching a movie. On closer inspection, it was
'Romeo+Juliet' and was very near the end. Unnoticed by David she saw him
flinch when the gunshot rang out, ending Claire Danes' life with her Romeo.
To her amazement, tears rolled down David's cheeks; a look of total sadness
on his face at the death of the star struck lovers. David looked away from
the screen and saw Willow standing in the door way.</p>

<p>"Willow!" David said, frantically trying to wipe away the tears before
she noticed. "What are you doing up so early?" he asked, trying to cover up
his weak moment. Willow sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"David, it's Ok. It's good to express your emotions every now and
then." she said in her gentle voice she used sometimes to comfort Xander.
David just grumbled and looked at his feet.</p>

<p>"So. Let me guess. You really love Claire Danes as Juliet, right?" She
asked. David looked at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I do. The seen where she and Leo see each other through the
fish tank is just so... so... well I don't know a word for it. And her
costume, you know the angel one? It is spot on. She is an angel." David said.
Willow smiled.</p>

<p>"I would have never picked you for a guy who was into romance
stories." Willow said to him.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I am. I've got a stash of books and movies of my favourites."
He stopped, realising what he said. "You even breathe a word of what I just
said to any one, ever, I will make you very sorry." said David. Willow just
giggled.</p>

<p>"Ok. Your secret dies with me." she said. The pair sat in comfortable
silence.</p>

<p>"Willow." he said.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she replied.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." David said sadly.</p>

<p>"For what? She asked.</p>

<p>"Everything. I'm sorry that I hurt you and Buffy. I'm sorry that we
aren't friends. I really envy Xander. He has these wonderful people who love
and care for him. I would give anything for that. I really wish we could be
friends. You guys are great." David said, a sad and wistful tone to his
voice. Willow raised one eye brow.</p>

<p>"Really? Even Buffy?" she asked. He grudgingly nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes. Even her. It's just hard, you know? We get on each other's
nerves. I don't mean to, I don't want to, but we do. We got off on the wrong
foot and it went down hill from there. We both share a lot in common. But,
well, I guess it ain't going to happen. All I ever wanted from you guys is to
be your friend." Willow took his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, how about you and I being friends? What do you say?" David
smiled at the red haired wicca.</p>

<p>"I'd love that." he said. His stomach growled, telling them both of
the need for breakfast. He got up.</p>

<p>"How about I start fixing breakfast?" he said with a bit of a flourish.</p>

<p>"Cool. Buffy and Xander won't be up for a while yet." she said and
turned to head for a shower. David stopped her.</p>

<p>"Willow." he said in a serious voice.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It is vital that you guys trust Xander. He has info that is vital in
the up coming days. You need to trust that Xander will make decisions that
are for the best. Remember, you guys are the centre of the universe to him."
he said then left, leaving Willow to ponder what was said.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It was around noon before the phone rang. David answered it in the
library. He came into the lounge room where everyone waited.</p>

<p>"Well?" Xander asked him. "Do we get the other Slayer or not?"</p>

<p>"Not quite." he told them</p>

<p>"What?" shot Buffy.</p>

<p>"Look, Albert said that the Council will allow us to put the case to
the full Council in person in 5 days time." David informed them.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that they want us to go to London to beg them for the
other Slayer?" Giles asked somewhat dismayed.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Look, it's much better than them saying no. I think we don't
have a lot of choice here. I have to make some calls and organise a few
things." said David who left the room.</p>

<p>"Great. The Council wants us to go begging for help. Wonderful."
Xander said rolling his eyes. Buffy turned to Giles.</p>

<p>"Do you really think that this is necessary?" she asked the former
Watcher.</p>

<p>"Buffy, we don't have any choice. We need the other Slayer." Giles
told her, unhappy at the prospect. The four of them continued to grumble
about the matter until David came back.</p>

<p>"Ok. It's arranged. Everyone pack because we head out this afternoon
for London." David told them.</p>
