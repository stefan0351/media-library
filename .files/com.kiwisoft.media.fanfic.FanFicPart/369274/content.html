<p><b>Chapter 17</b></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This couldn't be happening. Lilly kept repeating the phrase over and over in her head, like a mantra, as she climbed hastily down the tree. She was done being cautious and branches and twigs scratched her arms, legs and face as she went down, almost haphazardly moving from branch to branch. It reminded her of the same reckless abandon Miley normally portrayed climbing trees, but it was nowhere near the same. Lilly was only driven by fear and pure agony. She hardly dared to look down and in some ways she was grateful the sparse leaves of the tree spared her view from the scene below. Other than the wind there were no sounds, though she clearly heard the frantic beating of her heart. Perhaps it knew it was likely to be broken very soon.</p>
<p>Her hands shook as she grasped the branch and at last let herself drop onto the grass below. The crowd still stood off to the side, their faces betraying the shock they felt, yet no one had moved to help. Lilly didn't want to turn, she didn't want to see, but knew she had to. Just a few feet away Miley lay deathly still in the grass. Lilly was next to her in an instant, dropping to her knees. She reached a shaky hand out towards her girlfriend, turning Miley's face towards her. Miley did not react, her eyes closed.</p>
<p>"Miley, please…wake up…please," Lilly begged, realizing for the first time she was crying.</p>
<p>Miley did not move and her eyes remained closed. Though Lilly could see no outward injuries on the girl, she knew a fall from that height plus the lightning strike had likely done some serious damage to her girlfriend. Miley had jumped to save her. Lilly swallowed the lump in her throat and pushed all her pain and fear away, trying to focus. Her mother had forced her to take a First Aid class years ago and the blonde tried to remember what she had learned. She leaned closer to Miley, trying to discern a rising of the girl's chest or a breath exhaled from her lips, but she found nothing.</p>
<p>Renewed panic swelled inside of her and she turned to the crowd still watching her. "Help me, please…she's not breathing."</p>
<p>The crowd remained unmoving and silent, until one lone voice cried out from the safety of the masses. "Ding dong, the witch is dead!"</p>
<p>Some people joined in with the cheer and a sudden fury descended upon Lilly. "What is <b>wrong</b> with you people? You just saw her save my life!"</p>
<p>"After all the ones she took!" yelled a man in the crowd and several others agreed vocally.</p>
<p>Lilly squeezed her eyes shut, wishing she were somewhere safe, Miley in her arms being silly like always. But that was not the case and she had to focus, she had to save Miley and she would have to do it on her own. The blonde tilted her girlfriend's head back, pinched her nose shut and pressed her lips to Miley's. She blew the life-saving air into the unconscious girl's lungs, watching as Miley's chest rose and fell. She repeated the action and moved back to check for signs of breathing, but still nothing.</p>
<p>"What if you save her and she kills us all?" A hysteric voice sounded from the crowd.</p>
<p>Lilly only half-heartedly glanced at the crowd, before she sat up on her knees and put her hands on Miley's chest. She'd practiced this, multiple times, and it had seemed so simple, but now, the thought of doing it seemed impossible. Lilly gritted her teeth and began chest compressions, trying to keep the rapid rhythm required, but the hateful words of the crowd wouldn't leave her alone.</p>
<p>"What if she's been saving you all along?" yelled Lilly, angry with the crowd for hating Miley and angry with herself she had let it come to this.</p>
<p>"What the Sam hell are ya talkin' about, girl?"</p>
<p>She wasn't looking at them, too focused on continuing the compressions and keeping count in her head. When she reached thirty, she leaned back down to blow two more breaths into Miley's lungs. She still did not respond. The fear took stronger hold of Lilly's heart, but she ignored it and went back to doing compressions. Miley had to live; she had to be okay.</p>
<p>Lilly blinked the tears away, trying to concentrate, trying to focus, but the panic was so close to overwhelming her. She couldn't shake the image of Miley jumping off the tree, of the lightning bolt striking her girlfriend's body. Her arms were beginning to ache and she wondered how long she could keep doing this before she'd have to stop. She stopped again to breathe for Miley, thinking of the crowd behind her. They were fools, all of them, and if she lost her girlfriend because of them, there would be hell to pay. She went back to doing compressions.</p>
<p>"Every time she was struck…those around her…were saved." Lilly was trying to catch her breath, but it was getting harder. But she couldn't let those people get away with thinking Miley was evil, not when she knew it was so wrong.</p>
<p>"She's saved her family…your children…me…you…you're all just too close-minded to see it."</p>
<p>Another murmur went through the crowd, voices overlapping each other, swallowed by the wind so Lilly could barely make out what they were saying. Her words seemed to have made them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"That doesn't make any sense," yelled a random man, loudly enough for her to hear, but it almost sounded like he was fishing for an explanation.</p>
<p>Lilly squeezed her eyes shut briefly, too focused on what she was doing to really concentrate on them. She turned her head just enough to see Oliver standing at the front of the crowd and she knew he was her best link to them.</p>
<p>"Oliver, you were there…tell them…how many kids would have been struck…if Miley hadn't ran?"</p>
<p>The boy seemed to hesitate, but the numerous questioning stares forced him to answer. "A dozen, maybe. A lot…me…"</p>
<p>More voices rose from the crowd, but they sounded unsure. Lilly scoffed, growing even angrier with them. "Who remembers…the new mayor's inauguration last year?"</p>
<p>The murmur died down slightly, as most of them had clearly been present and remembered exactly what had happened. "She was in this same tree…when she was hit. Who would've been hit instead? Oliver? George? Old Ed?"</p>
<p>The air once again buzzed with a cacophony of voices, disbelieving, angry, unsure, guilty, but Lilly pushed them away. There was no point trying to convince them of what she knew was the absolute truth in her heart; she couldn't help having wanted to try. Things were going so wrong. She might have been doing CPR on Miley for three hours or three minutes, to Lilly it all felt like an eternity. Her heart was already breaking, the tears of grief already cascading down her face. Her arms trembled from her continuous effort and she was out of breath. She wanted bitterly to stop, but she could not let Miley die. She could not give up, not when Miley had sacrificed herself to save her. Lilly stifled a sob.</p>
<p>"Come on…breathe, Miley…just breathe."</p>
<p>There was still no response. Lilly could hardly feel her arms anymore. They burned with each movement and then it was as if she couldn't move them at all. Lilly yelled in frustration, knowing she had lost. She could not save Miley. She sat back on her heels, crying. Suddenly someone knelt down across from her and gently pushed her hands aside, before continuing the compressions. Lilly looked at Oliver, partially stunned, but grateful. New tears leaked from her eyes.</p>
<p>"Miley's not evil," yelled Lilly defiantly and heard the murmur in the crowd this time. She brushed the tears from her eyes and leaned down to breathe for Miley again.</p>
<p>"Come on, roadkill…breathe…just do it for me," begged Lilly, watching as Oliver rhythmically depressed the girl's chest. She heard a crack and winced. Oliver stopped again to let her give the rescue breaths.</p>
<p>Lilly leaned down to press her lips against Miley's again, when she felt the tiniest hint of a breath against her cheek. She cupped Miley's cheek, frantically trying to discern whether she had just imagined it. But with agonizing slowness, Miley blinked her eyes open, drawing another shuddering breath. Lilly's heart jumped from joy, as if the oppressive chains of grief and despair had suddenly melted away. It took several seconds for Miley's blue eyes to meet hers, but when they did, Lilly felt like crying again.</p>
<p>Her trademark grin spread across Miley's face, albeit a bit weak. Her voice shook as she spoke, but at least she was alive. "Lilly, I won."</p>
<p>"Wh-what?" asked Lilly, confused, wondering if Miley had hit her head. The brunette tried to push herself up, but both Lilly and Oliver stopped her with hands on her shoulders. "Miles, don't move. You might be seriously hurt."</p>
<p>"I won. I beat the Lightning Tree, five to four," said Miley, sounding almost triumphant and not at all like she had just jumped from a twenty-foot height to be hit by lightning and have her heart stop beating.</p>
<p>"You…you're crazy, Miley. Why did you do that?" yelled Lilly; the lifting of her panic and grief had given an irate anger a chance to rise.</p>
<p>Miley looked away briefly, before meeting her eyes again. Her hand reached shakily for Lilly's, who took it despite her anger. She noticed the burn mark on Miley's palm for the first time and swallowed hard.</p>
<p>"Lilly, I couldn't let you die…it would've taken you, too…I couldn't let it."</p>
<p>Lilly took a deep breath and shook her head, the anger bleeding out of her. "You've done that before, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Never from that height," said Miley, now smirking slightly again and Lilly rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Keep the lightning from taking people, I mean."</p>
<p>Miley looked into her eyes, but did not respond. Lilly didn't need a response to know the truth. She nodded softly and leaned down to press a soft kiss to her girlfriend's forehead. Miley groaned slightly as she pulled away and Lilly knew that despite her bravado, she must have been hurt. She wondered how she would get Miley out of there.</p>
<p>"Just relax Mile, we're gonna get you to a hospital," said Lilly softly, trying to sound reassuring, but she had no idea how she'd even get that accomplished. She had no car and highly doubted the town having an ambulance.</p>
<p>Oliver touched her arm lightly and she looked up, having forgotten he was even there. He nodded towards the crowd. "Mable called an ambulance a little while ago. It takes them forever to get here, though."</p>
<p>Lilly turned her head to the crowd, almost shocked. The people were no longer standing shoulder to shoulder, the crowd having dispersed somewhat, though people were still mingling about. It was hard to judge from her position, but she thought they at least no longer looked murderous. Someone had called an ambulance, which to her was akin to a miracle.</p>
<p>She sat back on the grass, suddenly feeling drained and tired. Lilly still held Miley's hand and she knew she'd be going to the hospital with her girlfriend, but she just wished she could go to sleep. A voice rang out suddenly, panicked, breaking through the crowd.</p>
<p>"Miley!"</p>
<p>Lilly turned, trying to discern where it was coming from. She knew there was only one person, other than her, in this town who really cared for the girl. Miley squeezed her hand and Lilly looked back at her. Miley had an odd look on her face.</p>
<p>"I think I'm gonna be grounded for a while."</p>
<p>Lilly blinked then burst out laughing. It was as if all the fear and pain and tears just drained out of her and she suddenly felt okay again. She brushed her other hand lightly across Miley's head, smiling, just as Susan reached them and dropped into the grass besides them.</p>
<p>"I think so, too, roadkill. I think so, too."</p>

<p>Four Weeks Later</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Miley, stop that," said Susan Stewart with a heavy sigh, though she did not look up from her task.</p>
<p>Lilly glanced over her shoulder, marveling at the fact Susan seemed to instinctively know when her daughter was doing something stupid. She shook her head and set the last of the plates on the table, while Susan returned into the kitchen to check on the food. Lilly followed, though her eyes tracked her girlfriend from across the breakfast bar. She watched her, amusement twinkling in her eyes. Miley was trying to do a wheelie in her wheelchair, quite unsuccessfully and Susan and Lilly, who had watched her fail multiple times, knew this attempt, too, would only end in disaster.</p>
<p>"Miley!"</p>
<p>The girl looked up, letting the wheelchair drop back onto all four wheels with a sheepish grin. Lilly did feel sympathy for her girlfriend; for someone like Miley it was torture being stuck in that chair for weeks on end with no way to relieve her energy. While the lightning strike had, again, done fairly little damage besides some new burns, the twenty-foot jump from the tree had done a number on the girl. Miley had practically shattered the bones in both her legs and feet and she'd had to endure multiple surgeries to be put back together. Because of the severity of the breaks and with both her legs involved, she'd been relegated to a wheelchair until her legs healed sufficiently to support weight. Miley was not happy about it, but they all knew it could have been so much worse.</p>
<p>Susan especially knew she had come dangerously close to losing her daughter. She also knew she owed Lilly for saving Miley's life, even though Lilly insisted the two girls were merely even now. Lilly had been a near permanent fixture at the cabin for the past three days since Miley's release from the hospital, though no one, least of all Miley, minded. She still couldn't believe she had been so stupid and nearly lost the most amazing girl ever – she thanked her mom almost daily.</p>
<p>"Miley, go wake your grandma and tell her it's time for dinner," said Susan, handing a bowl to Lilly to be taken to the table. Miley only mumbled a response, but sped down the hallway in her chair, nevertheless, almost bumping into a wall as she careened around the corner.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should get her a recliner instead; she is a menace with that thing," said Lilly, shaking her head as she watched her girlfriend go.</p>
<p>Susan chuckled, "Alright, I will let you break the news to her."</p>
<p>Lilly made a face at the thought of telling over-energetic Miley she'd have to sit still all day. It had been bad enough when Miley was restricted to her hospital bed in the weeks after the jump. She'd gone through multiple surgeries on the first few days and had therefore been mostly drugged, but once she was no longer sedated she had been nearly unbearable with her hyperactivity and anxiousness. Someone at the hospital had thought it a good idea, instead of foisting Miley on some other poor patient, to room her with her grandmother, much to the older woman's chagrin. Grandma Ruby had been released just a few days after Miley had been admitted, however.</p>
<p>Miley came back into the living room, at a much more subdued pace and Lilly wondered whether Grandma Ruby had given her another stern talking to. Lilly and Susan set the last of the food bowls onto the table, when they heard a crash. Both turned and Susan merely sighed at what she saw. Lilly, feeling just as exasperated, though knowing she couldn't let her girlfriend suffer, walked over to Miley, who looked up at her and made a face. She'd finally managed to tip over the wheelchair backwards, and was stuck on her back, with her brace imprisoned legs sticking into the air.</p>
<p>Lilly knew it had to hurt and decided not to say anything, reaching for the wheel brake, before righting the chair again with Miley in it. Miley smiled once they were face to face and Lilly leaned in, bringing their lips together softly. Miley was a great kisser, making Lilly's body tingle all the way down to her toes. She'd been trying to hold back for the past few weeks, because she knew, despite what she said, Miley was in a lot of pain. The girl never complained and one could hardly tell, except maybe in the evenings when she was stiff from sitting all day, but even then, it was only noticeable to those few people who knew Miley well enough.</p>
<p>"Come on, road kill, let's eat," said Lilly, leaning in for another quick kiss. Miley grabbed the front of Lilly's shirt and pulled her even closer, snaking her tongue into Lilly's mouth. There was no way Lilly could have stopped herself and she responded in kind, until someone cleared their throat loud enough for the two girls to break apart.</p>
<p>Miley laughed, while Lilly blushed a furious red as she turned to face Susan. She was already sitting at the table, Grandma Ruby next to her. Lilly hadn't even seen her come into the room and she blushed harder. She followed Miley to the table, sitting at her own designated spot. She remembered the first time she'd come over for dinner at Miley's and how awkward she'd felt then. Now it was just normal and she ate dinner here more often than at her own home.</p>
<p>Miley was already digging in, wolfing down her food with an amazing speed, and despite the looks of exasperation on her mother and grandmother's face, Lilly knew the two women were secretly glad Miley was doing so well despite everything. Lilly had spent a good deal of time talking to them while Miley was unconscious at the hospital and she knew they accepted her and liked her. She couldn't remember ever before having dated someone where everyone seemed to like each other - parents, grandparents and girlfriends.</p>
<p>"Hey momma, guess who came by today?" said Miley, mouth half-full with food.</p>
<p>Susan merely gave her a reproachful look for speaking with her mouth full and Miley swallowed before continuing. "George."</p>
<p>"George, who owns the General Store?" Susan sounded apprehensive and Lilly couldn't blame her, knowing how the townspeople had been behaving for years. "What did he want?"</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "Oh, grandma had forgotten something when she went. But he brought me some lollipops. He said he knew how much I liked them and since I wouldn't be able to come by for a while…"</p>
<p>Susan stared at her daughter for a few moments, then blinked. "Wow, uh…that's mighty nice of George. I hope you thanked him."</p>
<p>"Of course, momma," said Miley, sounding as if it had been an insult to even consider her failure to do so.</p>
<p>Lilly knew how shocked Susan felt; she'd felt the same way earlier when Miley had told her about it. It was hard to tell how the townspeople felt about Miley after everything that had happened, but Lilly felt as if things might have turned around, if only a bit. At the very least, she hadn't heard anyone say mean things to or about her girlfriend and that was a start, at least. She'd hung out with Oliver and Sarah once or twice and, though they still seemed somewhat apprehensive, they no longer tried to get her to break up with Miley or insinuate she was evil.</p>
<p>The most blatant change had come from her own brother, who despite his misgivings had actually come to apologize to Miley for what he had done. Lilly had been the most surprised of all and had wondered for the longest time whether her parents had forced him to do it. But Michael had admitted eventually that, despite everything he had felt, he could not hate someone who had been willing to sacrifice her own life to save Lilly's. While he might still not be a member of the Miley fan club, he was coming around.</p>
<p>"Lilly, are you staying tonight?" asked Susan, as if it were the most normal thing to ask someone her daughter was dating.</p>
<p>"Of course, Mrs. S. If Miley doesn't mind," said Lilly, smirking at her girlfriend.</p>
<p>Miley grinned. "I only mind when you hog all the covers."</p>
<p>Lilly made a face at her, but under the table she reached for Miley's hand and grasped it. Miley squeezed back, smiling at her widely. Of course, Lilly had stayed every nights since Miley had been back home, partially to reassure herself she was alive and partially because Miley claimed she only felt better when Lilly was around. Their families teased them relentlessly, but Lilly knew there was nothing wrong with being in love. And they were – totally, utterly, completely in love. And she wouldn't have it any other way, lightning strikes and mysteries be damned.</p>
<p><i>The End</i></p>
