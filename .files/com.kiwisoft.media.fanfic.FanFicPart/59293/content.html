<!-- Her Mother's Daughter \ null -->

<p>There are times when I can't help but wonder if I've
made a mistake raising Rory to think of me as her best
friend, rather than her mother.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I love her more than anything else
in the world. I just want more for her than my life.
Fortunately, she seems to be getting there pretty well
already. Not that that was all that hard, though, was
it? *Not* pregnant at 16, *didn't* drop out of
school... I know, I usually cover my feelings about
that - or just about anything, really - with a quip or
totally unrelated statement. Some people seem to think
that I *can't* be serious, at all, ever. I can be,
when I want to. But where's the fun in that?</p>
<p>But Rory... Sure, she can do the same thing sometimes,
but not nearly as often. And that's okay. I'm not
trying to turn her into me, no matter what my parents
might think. She is, after all, the Great Hope of the
Gilmore clan. She was recently accepted to Yale
(instead of Harvard, like she'd always wanted... but
she's surprisingly okay with that), which I'm sure
pleased my father to no end. Well, that's good. After
all, there aren't that many things that can make us
all equally happy - though, naturally, they all have
something to do with Rory. She's an angel, that girl.</p>
<p>Nothing would please my parents more, I'm sure, than
if Rory started dating someone from a family of wealth
and power. Unless she married said person, and that
might be difficult in this situation. Except, maybe,
in some country like Sweden, or something. They
weren't happy when she started dating Dean, though
they did get used to him. As for Jess... Well, we
don't go there around them. But they don't know about
her current interest.</p>
<p>Of course, that may have something to do with the fact
that *Rory* doesn't seem all that aware of her current
love interest. The tension has building since her
first year at Chilton (the second half of it, anyway),
and both halves of the potential couple somehow
completely missed it. I guess when it's someone you
don't like all that much, it's easy to misconstrue any
romantic feelings that might develop. Witty banter
gets confused with flirty. (And the first person who
makes a comment about my 'relationship' with Luke gets
cracked a good one, got me?) But I think Paris finally
began catching on after Rory's brief spat with Dean</p>
<p>Yes, Paris. As in, Paris Geller. Rory's "arch-enemy".
Kinda puts her behavior towards my daughter in a
different perspective, doesn't it? It certainly did
for me, and I'd have to mentally translate whenever
Rory was complaining about her to me. And it happened
a lot. How Rory never caught on, I'll never know.</p>
<p>I used to wonder if that was my fault. If I'd raised
her somehow to not even notice that same-sex
relationships exist. It's not that I was tying to,
it's just that, well... Aside from on TV, there aren't
exactly a lot of examples to show her around here.
Then I'd think, 'well, as much as she reads, she must
have picked up on that fact, right?' Which may have
been stupid on my part, since she hasn't exactly
picked up a lot of street smarts from her books, but
Dean helped her with that. A bit.</p>
<p>Anyway, as much as we've talked about it, I can't help
but think that something must have happened on her
trip to the capitol, because she came back a bit
subdued. Of course, she had to try and choose between
Dean and Jess, without causing any violence. Not an
easy task, really.</p>
<p>I don't want you to start thinking that I have some
problem against my daughter dating another girl. I
don't. No, *really*, I don't! It's just... Paris? Even
knowing that she was motivated more by jealousy than
actual dislike, she made my daughter's life miserable
throughout her time at Chilton. There has to be
something I'm missing, and I really wish Rory would
try and explain it before they finally admit their
feelings to each other. If she can explain it, anyway.
It's not always that easy, after all.</p>
<p>Yes, I *may* have had a personal experience with that
sort of thing (minus the girl-girl thing, that is),
but I'm not gonna tell you about it.</p>
<p>But if Paris makes Rory happy - and so far, the best
they've managed was "not upset" - then I'm happy. She
definately matches Rory better in the books,
intelligence, and grades departments than either Dean
or Jess ever did. The two of them can just talk and
talk for hours. Even things she doesn't talk about
with Lane. And that's good. Everybody should have a
friend like that. Well, *I* don't, really, except for
Rory. Even Sookie's a bit... Well, I love the woman,
really, but she can be a bit obsessive with her
cooking. Not that I mind that, but it can make it a
bit tough to talk about things with her. The only
person - aside from Rory, that is - I *can* talk to
(however laconically) about personal things is... Hey,
what did I tell you before? You know, I *do* have one
of Sookie's frying pans right here... Yeah, I thought
that would shut you up.</p>
<p>Maybe I can help her move things along. Rory's asked
Paris to come over tomorrow and help her pick out what
she'll need for Yale. Not that it took a lot of
convincing, mind you. But maybe if I say something to
Paris... As long as I don't scare her off. Rory would
*never* forgive me if I did that. But someone needs to
give those two a little nudge, or they might never
make a move. (Dammit, I *heard* that! Just because I
kissed him once...)</p>
<p>And the two of them make *such* a cute couple.</p>
