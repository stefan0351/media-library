<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 18 -->

<p>B'Elanna was greeted by the sight of Goliath and Annika's palfrey Jet both saddled and richly caparisoned in crimson cloth with gold trim, the trappings were one of Harry's gifts to the couple and indeed the two horses looked magnificent as they stood side by side awaiting their riders.  B'Elanna was wearing a dark green tunic and tights with a white sash around her waist.  It was approaching winter and the temperature was cool so over her shoulders was a dark green cape lined with white thrown back over her shoulders.  Her only other adornment was her sword.  Harry stepped forward and handed her the second of his gifts, which was a golden circlet to wear on her head?he purchased it to match the one he had helped B'Elanna buy for Annika.  They matched almost perfectly except that Annika's had a diamond set into its peak.</p>
<p>Annika was wearing the wedding dress that her mother had brought to her before she and Lord Hansart departed for France.  She was also wearing a cape that matched B'Elanna's; together they made a striking couple.  B'Elanna's breath caught in her throat when Annika stepped from her side of the tent in her wedding dress.  Her hair was piled high on her forehead, held in its place with the help of the circlet of gold.  </p>
<p>"You are the most beautiful sight it has ever been my privilege to behold my Lady," B'Elanna managed when she finally remembered to breathe. </p>
<p>Annika blushed at the complement and hastened to assure B'Elanna that she felt precisely the same way about her.  They both expressed their appreciation to Harry as they examined the beautiful cloth draped over their horses.  Soon everyone was ready and it was time to leave for the sacred grove.  B'Elanna lifted Annika into her saddle before she herself vaulted onto Goliath's broad back.</p>
<p>They rode out with the happy couple in front and the others following.  No one spoke as they rode side by side both busy with their own thoughts on this solemn occasion.  The group followed the track through the forest as they rode toward the enclave.  Soon they could see lights in the distance and as they arrived at the grove several of the villagers stepped forward to take the reins of the horses and help them to dismount.  Kate and Harry hurried forward to help their friends straighten their clothing and to remove their capes in preparation for the ceremony.  A young woman of the village came and drew Annika aside to describe for her what was about to happen and to teach her the parts of the rituals that she would be expected to recite.  A young man did the same for B'Elanna.</p>
<p>There were four young children, two girls and two boys who were waiting for Annika and B'Elanna to finish preparing for their wedding.  When they were ready the children stepped forward and took the hands of the celebrants, leading them toward the sacred grove.  The full moon was just coming into view over the horizon as the brilliant colours of the sunset faded in the western sky.  Harry, Tom and Kate followed along behind them, as did many of the villagers who were happy to help them celebrate their union.  When they reached the sacred grove they saw a very large circle marked out on the ground with quartzite rocks.  There were large beeswax candles flickering at four points of the circle marking the four cardinal points of the compass.  In the center was a large altar constructed from rock upon which several objects were laid out.  </p>
<p>The children led them to the east side of the circle, placing a circle of flowers upon both of their heads and kissing them on both cheeks before leaving to stand with the rest of the villagers to watch the ceremony.  Mary, the young woman who had healed B'Elanna's shoulder all those months ago, stepped into the grove and rang a small silver bell three times, indicating that the ceremony was about to begin. At this point B'Elanna took Annika's hand and led her once around the circle to enter it from the east again.  Annika was trembling with nerves as she walked with B'Elanna, but feeling the strength and steadiness of her warrior's arm she calmed down.</p>
<p>Mary walked four times around the circle, stopping at the candles to speak her invocation.  She returned to the centre of the circle, declaring the circle cast.  Turned to face the young couple and spreading her hands, palms toward the sky, the healer asked,</p>
<p>"Why have you come forth into the sacred circle on this night of the full moon?"</p>
<p>As one B'Elanna and Annika answered,</p>
<p>"We come to be joined together, so that we may be one in the eyes of the God and Goddess and of all of our friends here tonight."</p>
<p>Mary then turned toward the gathered crowd and asked,</p>
<p>"Is there anyone here present who knows of any reason why these two should not be handfasted here tonight?"</p>
<p>There was a moment of tense silence in which, thankfully, nobody spoke.  Then Mary continued with the ceremony.</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Annika exchanged the traditional vows of the handfasting ceremony.</p>
<p>"I have come of my own free will in perfect love and perfect trust to seek the partnership of my future spouse."</p>
<p>They exchanged simple gold rings reciting,</p>
<p>"I B'Elanna Torrance commit myself to be with Annika Hansart in joy and adversity, in wholeness and brokenness, in peace and turmoil, living with her faithfully all our days.  May the Gods give me the strength to keep these vows.  So be it."</p>
<p>Annika then repeated the vows to B'Elanna as a single tear tracked its way down her alabaster cheek.</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Annika then faced one another, joining both their left and right hands together; their arms and bodies forming a figure of eight, representing a symbol of perfect and infinite union.  Mary then took a red cord and knotted it tightly over their wrists indicating their intent to have a permanent relationship.</p>
<p>With their hands still knotted together B'Elanna and Annika then exchanged their personal vows.</p>
<p>"You are the person with whom I choose to spend my life.  I can imagine no more perfect joy than to share my life with you forever.  All that I am or ever shall become I dedicate this day to you, Annika, Lady of my heart," were B'Elanna's words.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I give myself to you this day heart and soul, body and mind.  You opened my eyes to all of the possibilities in life that I never dreamed of before I met you.  Thank you for loving me and accepting my love in return."  Annika had not had time to write her vows before hand, but she spoke from the heart and brought a tear to the eye of many of the guests present that night with her heartfelt words.</p>
<p>At this point Mary untied the cord from around their wrists and handed a knife to B'Elanna, who reached over and cut a lock of hair from Annika's head before handing her the knife so that she might do the same.  The couple then placed their combined locks into a small silver box, which they buried at the centre of the circle.  Mary then turned to them and gave her final benediction.</p>
<p>"Be understanding and patient, each with the other. Be free in the giving of affection and warmth.  Be sensuous with one another.  Have no fear and let not the ways of the unenlightened give you unease, for the Gods are with you now and always."</p>
<p>She then turned to the crowd and asked of them whether or not they would support the young couple in their marriage.  The answer was a resounding "I do," the loudest voice among them was Harry's.  Mary then pronounced the couple handfasted and asked that they exchange kisses as their first gifts to one another as a handfasted couple.  When their lips met in the first kiss of their married life the crowd cheered to signify their approval of the marriage.  At this point Tom and Harry picked up the broom that was leaning on the back of the altar and held it out.  B'Elanna and Annika joined hands and jumped over the broomstick, once again to the cheers of the crowd.</p>
<p>Mary then performed a small ceremony that banished the circle, declaring,</p>
<p>"The circle is open but unbroken. May the peace of the Old Ones go in our hearts.  Blessed be."  </p>
<p>She rang the bell three times and then B'Elanna and Annika walked the circle clockwise until they were back at the east side of the circle.  At this point they each lit a candle and using those individual candles they lit a third to signify that they were one.  They then used that candle to light two torches.  The rest of the villagers had all gathered up unlit torches and left ahead of the couple, lining the route to the banquet tent in pairs.  The first couple in the line then lit the torches of the next couple in line and B'Elanna and Annika walked beneath the raised torches of the villagers that lit the way to the wedding feast with the flames of their combined love.</p>
<p>The wedding feast was to be held in a large open tent lit brightly with torches.  The tent was festooned with wreathes of ivy and the tables were laden with food and decorated with bouquets of flowers.  B'Elanna and Annika led the way into the tent and took their seats at the head of the long table that would serve as seating for all of the guests.  Harry had asked that the villagers spare no expense when they prepared the wedding feast and he had used a goodly portion of the money they had retrieved from his father's house to pay for the food and mead that was laid out before them now.  The villagers, who remembered Harry and B'Elanna from their previous visit, had gotten into the spirit of the occasion and prepared a wonderful feast for this special night.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe her eyes when she saw how beautifully everything had been arranged.  She had to blink back tears as she thought of how much work Harry and the villagers had done on her behalf.  She turned to Harry who was sitting just to her left and pulled him into a rough embrace, thanking him profusely for all of this effort.  Harry himself had tears in his eyes as he saw the last and most precious of his best friend's dreams come true.  </p>
<p>Annika was overcome with emotion after everything that had happened today.  She knew that B'Elanna had put a lot of thought into the ceremony and that Harry had personally made all of the arrangements.  The kindness of the villagers was most touching to her, as she knew that they were virtual strangers to B'Elanna and most certainly to her.  She was unused to kindness like this?a kindness that asked nothing in return, that made no demands on its recipients.  In her experience people did not go to such lengths of kindness just out of the goodness of their hearts and it overwhelmed her to see that such people existed in this world.  She was happier than ever that they had decided to pursue B'Elanna's idea and be handfasted in the pagan tradition.</p>
<p>The meal consisted of roasted meats and vegetables and was absolutely delicious.  The men of the village had hunted for days to procure enough meat for all of them, and the vegetables had to be purchased from local farms, as the village could not spare enough of their own produce without leaving them short over the winter.  </p>
<p>Harry had ridden to several of the local farms to arrange for the produce to be delivered to the enclave.  One of the young village women had been his guide as he traveled.  Her name was Sarah and they had grown quite close over the course of the few days he had spent in the enclave.  He had been happy to see her again when they returned for the wedding and she sat on his left now at the table as they enjoyed the fruits of their labours.</p>
<p>Annika had only recently begun to spend time among what her father had termed the peasantry.  She was used to quiet genteel company in which women remained silent and only took their food after they were certain the men had had their fill.  To see an entire village sitting cheek by jowl, laughing and talking loudly, with the women and men eating together was entirely new to her.  She heard the women teasing and worrying at the men and again she marveled at how different this world was from the one in which she had grown up. She was ever more happy that she had left behind the stultified environment in which her family had existed.  She knew she would learn to love this atmosphere of raucous fun and irreverent humour.  She had seen B'Elanna interacting in a similar fashion with some of the other knights after tournament, but she had never realized that such a thing was in her reach.</p>
<p>She was enjoying the simple food as well.  She was used to food rich in sauces that buried the flavour of the ingredients; simple things like roasted meat appealed to her taste buds, although it had taken some getting used to initially.  She ate what was for her a hearty meal and as usual she marveled at how much food B'Elanna was able to consume.  She would have her hands full keeping her wife full; she laughed to think of herself as a housewife, but she knew that she would never be alone in her responsibilities.  She and B'Elanna would have an equal partnership in all such things.  She looked forward to all of the new experiences she would have now that she had embraced her new lifestyle.</p>
<p>When everyone had eaten their fill the men of the village leapt up and pulled the tables to the sides of the tent and several of the villagers pulled out musical instruments and began tuning them up.  Soon they began to play and everyone joined in the dancing.  This was a very different style of music and dance from that of the formal balls that the young couple was used to attending after the tournaments.  The villagers laughed at their early attempts to emulate the steps, and soon the young people were happily teaching the traditional folk dances to B'Elanna and her group.  It was a much more energetic style of dancing and B'Elanna thoroughly enjoyed herself, as did the others.  They danced until the moon was waning in the sky, and the village children had long since curled up under tables and benches and fallen asleep.  Everyone had consumed a quantity of mead and now the tired and happy crew began to trail away from the banquet tent toward their homes.</p>
<p>B'Elanna sought out Harry to find out where their horses were being kept so that they could return to their camp.  She nearly ran into him as she rounded the corner of the tent. She found him kissing the young woman who had been sitting with him at the table.  She wasn't sure who was more surprised?she or Harry.  The young squire was blushing furiously at first, but eventually he had to laugh at the comical look on the face of B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"Er, what can I do for you B'Elanna?" he finally managed.</p>
<p>"Sorry Harry?I didn't know that you?I mean I didn't mean to interrupt you and?I, uh, I was just looking for the horses?I mean I was looking for you to see if you knew where the horses were.  Annika and I are going to head back to the camp now."</p>
<p>Harry laughed again at B'Elanna's embarrassment at catching him in the arms of a woman. </p>
<p>"Goliath and Jet are stabled in the village but you and Annika aren't coming back to the camp tonight.  You can hardly spend your wedding night on the other side of a tent from the rest of us now can you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna had not even considered such a thing.  In fact she had been so nervous about the night that she pretty much put it out of her head?preferring to concentrate on more esoteric details such as food and drink.  She gave Harry a questioning look and he smiled and told her he would show her what he meant.  She noted that he kept hold of Sarah's hand as led the way to the last of the surprises he had prepared for the young couple on this special day.</p>
<p>B'Elanna gave Annika her arm and the two of them followed Harry and Sarah out of the tent and into the woods, picking up torches as they went to light their way.  Harry led them to a small path in the woods that had been strewn with wildflowers.  </p>
<p>"Just follow your nose my friend," he smiled, stepping aside and indicating the way with a flourish of his arm.</p>
<p>B'Elanna gave him a parting hug and a kiss on both cheeks before she took Annika's hand and followed the path of wildflowers into the woods.  The path took a few twists and turns and in the distance they could see a light.  As they rounded the final curve they saw a brand new tent pitched in a small clearing.  It was lit from within, and slowly B'Elanna led the way into the structure.</p>
<p>The tent contained a bed frame that was draped with sleeping covers and blankets; there was a small table that held a jug of water and a flagon of mead.  In addition Harry had somehow managed to have some of their belongings brought out to the tent at some point during the evening.  There were several oil lamps burning and a number of unlit candles set around the bed.  B'Elanna shook her head at how Harry had anticipated and arranged for all of their needs in such a lovely manner.  There was even some bread and cheese in a small basket so they would not have to worry about food in the morning.</p>
<p>Now that they were finally alone B'Elanna found herself unsure of what to do with herself.  Her stomach was filled with butterflies as she contemplated the next few hours spent in the company of her new wife.  She could tell that Annika was at least as nervous as she was herself and somehow this calmed her nerves.  She helped Annika off with her cloak and then removed her own, draping them over a nearby chair.  She unbuckled her sword and laid it aside.  Now that her usefulness was at an end she was again faced with the fact that she had no idea what to do next.</p>
<p>"Would you like a cup of mead Annika?" she asked as a way to fill some time.</p>
<p>"I believe I have had enough to drink, but if there is water I could do with a cup of that."  Annika answered.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was grateful to have something with which to occupy herself and so she hastened to pour two cups of water for herself and Annika.  They stood sipping their water in silence for an uncomfortable moment or two, until B'Elanna finally barked out a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>"We are behaving like a couple of teenagers and not at all like a married couple."</p>
<p>Annika had to smile at the truth in B'Elanna's words.</p>
<p>"I find that I am more than a little nervous," she explained.</p>
<p>"As am I my love, as am I."</p>
<p>B'Elanna sat on the edge of the bed frame and patted the mattress beside her.</p>
<p>"Come sit with me Annika my love."</p>
<p>Annika stepped to the bed and sat close beside her wife.  B'Elanna picked up her hand and held it softly in her own, rubbing her thumb gently over the back of Annika's hand.  She eventually brought Annika's soft white hand up to her lips and kissed it sweetly.</p>
<p>"You know there is no law that says we need do anything other than talk and sleep tonight," she said softly.</p>
<p>She had to laugh at the comic look of despair that flashed over Annika's face at her words.</p>
<p>"This is our wedding night B'Elanna.  We have waited for so long to be together.  Do you not desire me any longer?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do my beloved wife.  I have desired you since the first time I laid eyes on you in France.  I merely want you to know that if you are not ready, or you wish to wait until a later time I will respect your feelings.  I will wait as long as you need me to for our first time together to be perfect."</p>
<p>"I do not wish to wait B'Elanna.  I am merely uncertain as to what to do."</p>
<p>"To be perfectly honest my love I am not exactly sure what to do either, I only know that I wish to be with you and to show you how much I love and treasure you."</p>
<p>"Well, we are two intelligent and resourceful women?I am certain we will think of something," Annika joked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't stop herself from laughing at Annika's comment and at last the tension between them was broken.  She took her young wife in her arms and pulled her close, their lips meeting gently at first and then harder, more insistent as the passion they had so long denied took hold of them both.  B'Elanna was thrilled to feel Annika's hands at her lap, loosening and removing the sash from around her waist?apparently her wife's passions matched her own in every way?this was a very good sign indeed.  </p>
<p>Annika felt her heart hammering in her chest, her passion swelling with each caress of her lover's hands.  She loved the feeling of B'Elanna's velvety tongue exploring her mouth, as her strong hands explored the contours of her body.  When B'Elanna tried to pull her up onto her lap her legs tangled in the restraining material of her dress.  She kissed her warrior wife once more and then stood up, pulling B'Elanna to her feet beside her.</p>
<p>"Help me," she asked softly, indicating that B'Elanna should untie the laces at the back of her dress.</p>
<p>B'Elanna obeyed with shaking hands and then watched as Annika slowly slid the heavy linen of her wedding dress from off her shoulders, allowing it to pool on the floor at her feet.  Her flawless alabaster skin was still obscured by the whalebone corset that cinched her waist in so tightly that it was only two hand spans across.  Annika loosened some of the laces at the front, but again she required B'Elanna's help to undo the laces in the back.  When B'Elanna released the laces and helped Annika remove the restrictive garment she was shocked to see the red marks cut into her wife's skin by the stays of the corset.</p>
<p>"I had no idea you suffered so much just from the wearing of your clothes," she said with real sympathy in her voice.</p>
<p>"They are not pleasant, but every lady wears one?I am surprised that you yourself have never worn one B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"You forget I was a peasant girl?with only my father to raise me I never really wore women's clothing.  He tried to get me to be a lady, but he was away so much with Lord Kim that eventually he just gave up and let me have me own way."</p>
<p>As she spoke B'Elanna was massaging away the redness on Annika's skin using her hands to smooth away the lines imprinted on the pale skin, too shy to touch the perfect breasts that had been revealed with the removal of the corset.  She dropped to her knees and pressed her mouth to Annika's waist, soothing the heated flesh with her tongue.  Annika was lightheaded when she felt B'Elanna's hands on her waist, but when she felt her wife's tongue begin to caress her skin she could no longer keep her feet.  She sank onto the floor beside the young warrior, and buried her head in her wife's neck. </p>
<p>As she nuzzled under B'Elanna's chin she drew in a breath and was intoxicated by the scent of her lover's skin.  She couldn't resist pressing her mouth to the hollow of her throat, and reaching out with her tongue to savour her wife's taste.  She wanted to explore her warrior's body more fully but was hampered by the fact that B'Elanna was still fully clothed.  With fingers unused to the task she slowly unlaced B'Elanna's tunic and slid it up over her head, then undid the loose linen shirt she wore beneath.  It was Annika's turn to be surprised when she saw the bindings around B'Elanna's chest.</p>
<p>"I see that I am not the only one who must wear restrictive clothing when out in public," she mused as she began to undo the wrappings and unwind the cloth bands from her lover's chest.</p>
<p>"A necessary evil if I am to pass as a man in public," B'Elanna replied.</p>
<p>Annika finished removing the restrictive bindings and stood back to marvel at the power and beauty that was revealed by its removal.  B'Elanna's breasts were small and pert and her shoulders, arms and stomach rippled with muscle.  She reached out to trace the red, ropelike scars that stood on in bas-relief on her warrior's body.  </p>
<p>"You received this when you saved my family from the highwayman," she mused.</p>
<p>"Yes and you bound my wounds and took care of me that day.  I think that day was when I realized that you were much more than just a beautiful woman?you were brave and resourceful?"</p>
<p>"I was frightened near to death that day," Annika interrupted.</p>
<p>"I would never have guessed you were frightened my love?you seemed so calm to me."</p>
<p>"If I was calm it was only because I felt so safe with you there my Lord," she smiled,  "just as I feel safe with you now."</p>
<p>"It is my most sacred trust to ensure that you will always be safe my love?I will spend my life to my last breath defending you and all that you care for."</p>
<p>Annika took B'Elanna's face in her hands, tears shining in her eyes, </p>
<p>"I know that you will my wife."</p>
<p>Their lips met once more and B'Elanna gathered Annika up into her arms and in one smooth powerful motion stood and carried her to the bed, laying her down gently without ever breaking the contact of their lips.  Annika's arms came up to twine around her neck, holding her close as B'Elanna stretched the length of her body along that of her wife.  She balanced on one arm and finally allowed herself to reach out and touch the perfect skin of her lover.  She stroked her fingers through Annika's hair and traced her exquisite jaw line; she let her fingers dance over the bone structure of her collar bone and down along the sides of her breast, eliciting a gasp from the younger woman's full and luscious lips.  She limned the outlines of her ribcage and down along her hip, pulling the slim young body closer to her own. </p>
<p>In her, albeit limited, conversations about sex with her mother Annika had always assumed that it was something that proper women merely endured.  She had never heard one word about pleasure or desire and she had been fully prepared to merely get through the night in hopes that B'Elanna as a woman would not demand lovemaking too often.  So it was that she was shocked by the passion and desire that she felt coursing through her body with every touch of her wife's hands.  She ached to explore her lover's body with hands and lips, and was surprised to hear herself moaning in pleasure at B'Elanna's touch.  She couldn't stop her body from pressing against B'Elanna's in an effort to maximize the contact between them.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was operating on instinct alone as she moved her body over Annika's, balancing on her elbows and knees between her legs.  She lowered herself gently down until the aching tips of her breasts brushed against the nipples of Annika's as they strained upward to meet her.  At the moment of contact the sensation was so exquisite that they gasped in unison and B'Elanna had to fight to maintain control of her body and stop herself from collapsing on top of Annika. She rocked back and forth enjoying the sensations the movement evoked as their painfully erect nipples rubbed together.  She placed soft sweet kisses on Annika's mouth, flicking out her tongue to taste her lips, drawing one and then the other into her mouth, biting and then soothing them with her tongue. </p>
<p>Annika couldn't stop her hips from pressing ever upward; she ached for contact with her lover, and her breath caught in her throat as B'Elanna lowered herself down until their centers met.  The sensation was electric and Annika instinctively locked her legs around B'Elanna in an attempt to draw her ever closer.  The shy young blonde gave herself completely over to the sensations she was experiencing?she allowed her hands to wander all over B'Elanna's body, relishing the feeling of her wife's muscles working as she made sweet love to her.  She reached up to cup the warrior's breasts, rolling her cinnamon coloured nipples between her fingers, loving the sound of B'Elanna's moans as she did so.  She felt their sweat soaked bodies sliding together and heard the ragged sound of B'Elanna's passion-laboured breathing; this was pleasure and sensation beyond her wildest imagining.</p>
<p>Loving B'Elanna had set her free and now it was giving her wings.  The pressure was building in both of them, but it was Annika who reached the breaking point first?the sound of her name torn from her lover's mouth sent B'Elanna over the edge almost simultaneously and she rolled to her side pulling Annika on top of her, holding her tight and rocking them both through the aftershocks of passion that washed over both of them.  Many minutes passed before either of them were able to speak or move and when they did it was to move together once again in love.</p>
