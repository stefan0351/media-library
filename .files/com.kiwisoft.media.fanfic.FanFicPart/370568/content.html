<p style="text-align:center;"><B>3</B></P><P>"Hey!" howled Ashley early the next morning. "My shoes, there's something in my shoes! Someone put something in my shoes! Stewart put something in my shoes! Trina! Trina!"</P><P>Trina came bounding onto the scene. "What's going on around here? What's all the yelling about?"</P><P>Ashley held up one of her dripping running shoes. "Look at this! Look what Stewart did!"</P><P>"<I>Stewart!</I>" bellowed the counselor. "What is this?"</P><P>Miley took the running shoe and examined it carefully. "Garbage," she diagnosed. "More specifically, an eggshell, an orange peel and some unidentified slop, obviously from the mess hall."</P><P>"All right, Stewart," said Trina angrily, "you'll wash these sneakers!"</P><P>"Why do you immediately assume that I'm guilty?" asked Miley in a hurt tone.</P><P>Trina was taken aback.  "Well—did you do it?"</P><P>"Yes."</P><P>"Then spill that stuff out and take the shoes over to the laundry, you hear me?"</P><P>Miley nodded. "They can probably hear you on the mainland."</P><P>"All right, you guys," called Trina, "hurry up and get dressed and go to breakfast. This morning we write letters home. Meet back here at the cabin after chow."</P><P>"I'll be interested to see what Stewart writes home," said Ashley savagely. "I've never seen a letter written by a nut before."</P><P>"Shut up!" snapped Lilly.</P><P>"That's enough!" bellowed Trina. "Get moving!"</P><P>Miley reached over and chalked another line on the wall beside her bed. "Two," she counted.</P><P>"Only twenty-six more," sighed Lilly.</P><P>"Barring any natural disaster," Miley added, pokerfaced.</P><P>Trina was herding the other girls out the door. "Stewart, Truscott, hurry! You two catch up with us at the wash station."</P><P>Miley reached over and picked up Ashley's pillow. "Would you please hold this pillowcase open?" she said to Lilly.</P><P>"What are you doing?"</P><P>"Clone's orders," said Miley righteously. "I was told to spill the garbage out of Ashley's running shoes."</P><P>"Yeah," said Lilly, "but in her pillow…?"</P><P>"No one said just where. I thought this was as good a place as any."</P><P>"You'll get us into trouble," warned Lilly.</P><P>"So I'll get another work detail and I'll haul a little more garbage. Anyhow, the dump is the only place on Alcatraz where a girl can get any privacy."</P><P>"Oh, all right," laughed Lilly, holding open the pillowcase and watching the garbage drop inside. "Little Ashley has a big mouth that needs shutting."</P><P>"Precisely," Miley agreed.</P><P><I>Dear Daddy,</I> wrote Miley. <I>This place is terrible. Each day I'm subjected to countless atrocities. The food is spoiled and poisonous, and the drinking water is contaminated so there is an outbreak of typhoid.  Our cabin collapsed last night in a typhoon, but don't worry. Only one girl got killed.</I></P><P><I>It ain't all bad.  I do have one friend, named Lilly. She's the only one who pulled me out of the quicksand. I have to haul garbage every day, but there aren't too many wild animals at the dump and I've only been bitten twice.</I></P><P><I>Ms. Warden, the director, is very nice, and she has a real social conscience. She hires only desperate criminals as counselors. Our bunk counselor, whose name is Trina, is a reformed axe-murderer on parole. She has red eyes and yells a lot and keeps an axe under her mattress.</I></P><P><I>Tonight is really gonna be fun. Our cabin hasn't been fixed yet, so we get to sleep in trees. I sure hope the typhoon doesn't start up again.</I></P><P><I>I'll be safe and sound so long as Algonkian Island doesn't sink any further.</I></P><P><I>Your daughter,</I></P><P><I>Miley</I></P><P><I>P.S. If this letter looks messy it's because I'm writing it while being chased by a bear.</I></P><P>Hovering over her letter-writing charges, Trina stopped beside Miley's bunk and let out a bellow of rage.</P><P>"Stewart, what is this?" She ripped the letter out of Miley's hand. "Typhoid? There's no typhoid here. And no atrocities." She read on. "A typhoon? Are you crazy?...Criminals? I'm <I>not</I> an axe-murderer! I've never even wanted to kill anybody—until now!...You don't have to sleep in a tree. Nothing happened to the cabin…bears? There aren't any bears on the whole island. Stewart, you tear this up and write a proper letter!"</P><P>"Are you interfering with personal mail?" asked Miley.</P><P>"Look, Stewart," pleaded Trina, "this stuff is all lies! It'll upset your dad."</P><P>"No it won't," said Miley. "He doesn't get upset that easily. He knows me."</P><P>"Listen," said Trina in exasperation, grabbing Ashley's letter from her hand.  "This is what a letter is supposed to sound like. <I>Dear Mom. I'd be having a great time if it weren't for this real nut in our…</I>"  The counselor's voice trailed off. "Well, this, then—" she grabbed another letter. "<I>Dear Mom and Dad. Having a great time. The weather is good. Don't forget to feed my chameleon. Send money. Love, Sarah.</I>" Her eyes shone triumphantly. "Now that's a real letter!"</P><P>"Mine is more creative," objected Miley.</P><P>"You're going to <I>mail</I> that?" cried Trina. "You can't send that! I'll kill you!"</P><P>"Threats of violence," said Miley, making notes.</P><P>"Stewart," said Trina in a lower tone, "listen to reason. Tear up that letter. Don't you realize the camp could sue you for all those lies?"</P><P>Miley obligingly tore up her masterpiece and sat down to write another.</P><P>"Attagirl. You write your dad a nice letter. He deserves it. He's spending a lot of money to send you here."</P><P>"And here I thought I was doing time," said Miley mildly. "How's this?"</P><P>Trina took the letter and read it: "<I>Dear Daddy. How are you? I am okay. This certainly is a camp, all right. Only twelve more days to visiting day. Your daughter, Miley.</I> There, now. That's much better," she said with a dubious frown. "Okay, everybody, finish up those letters! We're going to run the obstacle course and we're going to win!"</P><P>"Stewart won't," sneered Ashley.</P><P>"Stewart certainly won't," agreed Miley.</P><P>"<I>Why?</I>" bawled Trina. "You need the exercise and excitement."</P><P>"You know I don't run," said Miley. "Besides, Lilly'n I are going to arts and crafts."</P><P>"We are?" whispered Lilly.</P><P>"Aw no," protested Trina. "You can do that kind of stuff when it rains."</P><P>"It's rainin'," said Miley firmly.</P><P>"What do you mean, raining? The sun's shining."</P><P>"It doesn't have to be rainin' to be rainin'."</P><P>Trina scratched her head for a moment. Then, "What about you, Truscott?" she asked, undaunted. "Why don't you come along and have some fun with us?"</P><P>"No, thanks," said Lilly, shuffling uncomfortably.</P><P>"Oh, let them go," said Ashley in disgust. "They'd only ruin everything anyway."</P><P>"Ashley, you've got a big mouth!" said Trina.</P><P>"Agreed," said Miley.</P><P>"You too, Stewart!" snapped the counselor. "Let's go, guys. We're due on the obstacle course. Stewart, Truscott, we'll see you two at lunch."  And she jogged off with the rest of the girls trailing along behind her.</P><P>"What do you want to go to arts and crafts for?" asked Lilly, mystified.</P><P>"We're not going to arts and crafts," Miley explained. "We're going to build a dam."</P><P>A slow smile of understanding spread over Lilly's face.</P><P>"What the heck happened to Stewart and Truscott?" asked Trina, looking around the dining room. "They're twenty minutes late for lunch."</P><P>"They're probably finger-painting," sneered Ashley. "Or basket-weaving. Isn't that what they always do with nuts?"</P><P>"Shut up, Ashley," said Trina, standing. "I'm going to find them."</P><P>As if on cue, Miley and Lilly walked in the door, two blobs of mud. With every step they took they rained filth down onto the clean wood floor.</P><P>"Stewart!" cried Trina in horror. "What happened to you girls?"</P><P>"It gets a little messy in arts and crafts," offered Miley.</P><P>"What are you building? A dam?"</P><P>Lilly started visibly.  "How did you know?" she blurted.</P><P>"Don't get smart, Truscott!" snapped Trina. "That'll cost you another day's work detail. I asked you what you're building."</P><P>"A <I>salet</I><I>é</I>," Miley replied. "A good one."</P><P>Trina's face went blank. "A <I>salet</I><I>é</I>—uh, that's nice. All right, you guys, go clean up and grab some lunch. Make it fast because we're going swimming later."</P><P>"Well," said Miley, "Lilly and I thought we'd go back and do some more work on our <I>salet</I><I>é</I>."</P><P>"But you have to pass the swimming test," protested Trina. "If you don't get your badge you won't be allowed to go canoeing or water-skiing."</P><P>"I think I can live with that," Miley decided. She turned to Lilly. "You?"</P><P>Lilly nodded sheepishly. "I'd rather go back to arts and crafts."</P><P>Trina looked pained.  "All right. Just for today. Now go and get cleaned up."</P><P>On their way to the wash station Lilly turned to her companion. "Miley, what on earth is a <I>salet</I><I>é</I>?"</P><P>Although she did not smile, Miley's poker face assumed an expression of deep satisfaction. "It's French," she explained. "It means dirt."</P><P>For the next ten minutes the wash station rang with Lilly's laughter.</P><P>Lilly waded through the hip-deep muddy water of the creek and heaved herself up onto the grassy bank where she lay panting.</P><P>"Miley, it can't be done. It just can't!"</P><P>Miley surfaced and spat a stream of water in a long arc.</P><P>"This is impossible," she gasped, clambering up to join Lilly on the grass. "The water must be over six feet in the middle."</P><P>"There isn't enough brush and mud on this whole island to dam that up," said Lilly.  "It can't be done!" she repeated.</P><P>"Oh, yes it can," said Miley. "But it would take months. And I'm planning to be out of here long before one month."</P><P>"How?" asked Lilly.  "We just decided we can't dam up this dumb creek."</P><P>"My new idea is simplicity itself. We just take off, that's all."</P><P>"Great," said Lilly sarcastically. "One day we just pick up and walk away. I suppose it never occurred to you that this miserable place is an island."</P><P>"We take a boat," Miley explained patiently.</P><P>"That's stealing!"</P><P>"No, it isn't. When we're through with it we'll set it afloat back to camp with a note explaining the situation—which is, we're going home."</P><P>"Miley, that's crazy," argued Lilly. "Even if we do get across the lake, we're still nowhere. It's like a hundred miles to Malibu!"</P><P>Miley's head swung around to look at Lilly. "You live in Malibu?" she asked curiously. "What part?"</P><P>"Northern. Up near the megamall."</P><P>"Holy shit, me too," Miley observed. Despite the tone of her voice, her face remained passive. "I live on Bountiful street, right by the beach."</P><P>"I'm in Douglas Court! We're practically neighbors!" Lilly said excitedly.</P><P>"Look," said Miley, redirecting the conversation, "our resident clone won't let me write to my dad the way I want to, and the Warden sure won't let me use the phone to call them to come and get me. The only way is to get off this rock and get to a phone on the mainland."</P><P>"We don't even know where the nearest town is," protested Lilly.</P><P>"We'll find it. How far can it be? Alcatraz must get its supplies from somewhere close by."</P><P>"What about our parents? When the Warden informs them we're missing they'll go nuts!"</P><P>Miley shook her head.  "If we leave early enough we'll have phoned home long before Her Cloneship even knows we're not in camp." She paused. "Anyway, suit yourself. I'm going tomorrow."</P><P>Lilly pictured herself at the Algonkian without Miley to talk to. "I'll go," she said quickly.</P><P>"All right. Tomorrow before dawn we borrow a motor boat and we're off."</P><P>"I guess so," agreed Lilly unhappily.</P><P>The two sopping, muddy figures began to walk in the direction of the compound.</P><P>A pair of beady little eyes watched them go. When the intruders had disappeared, he came out of the underbrush, a lone beaver. His lodge and dam at the far end of the lake had been destroyed by cottage builders. For nearly three weeks he had been searching the lake for a site suitable for a new home, and here was a dam already started…</P><P>"Hey!" shouted Ashley at lights-out. "My pillow—there's something in my pillow! Someone put something in my pillow! Stewart put something in my pillow! Trina! <I>Trina</I>!"</P><P>Trina burst onto the scene. "What's all the yelling about?"</P><P>"Stewart put garbage in my pillow!"</P><P>"<I>Stewart!</I>" howled Trina, waving the soiled pillowcase. "Did you do this?"</P><P>"I would be the logical suspect," admitted Miley.</P><P>"You'll sleep without a pillow for this! Go hang Ashley's pillow out on the line to air and give her yours! And another day's work detail for you!"</P><P>"I'm not having fun," warned Miley.</P><P>"You'll start having fun when you join in the activities and stop making trouble," growled Trina. She turned to the rest of the group, all in their beds. "Now you guys go to sleep right away. I've got a counselors' meeting."</P><P>"Sorry I'm late, guys," said Trina as she wearily entered the mess hall where the rest of the counselors were assembled for the meeting. "I've got a real dozer of a cabin this month!"</P><P>"Me too!" exclaimed Kitty of Cabin 3. "They never go to sleep. They just talk all night."</P><P>"You're lucky," sighed Trina. "All mine want to do is fight. I've got this kid Stewart—she won't do <I>anything</I>! All she does is stuff garbage in other kids' things. I don't know how you stood her, Chantel. She and her buddy spent all day in arts and crafts."</P><P>"No, they didn't," said Chantel. "Arts and crafts was closed today."</P><P>Trina turned purple.  "See what I mean? Now I'll never know where she was! She and Truscott came back covered in mud and told me it was messy in arts and crafts! This is what I have to put up with! I'm only one person!"</P><P>"Calm down," soothed Lauren, the swimming coach. "The poor girl's probably just homesick. That's what it sounds like to me."</P><P>"I thought so too at first," moaned Trina, "but now I'm beginning to wonder. You should have seen the letter she tried to write home. And all she ever says is 'I don't…I don't swim, I don't run, I don't anything.' She's driving me crazy!"</P><P>"Aw, give her a chance," said Ruby of Cabin 9. "A few more days and she'll be having fun like everybody else."</P><P>"But where were they? Where were they when they were supposed to be at arts and crafts? <I>Where</I>?"</P>
