<!-- The Better Life \ Chapter 7: Echo -->

<p>Faith turned around slowly hardly able to believe what she had heard.  The
shoe fit?  Was in possible that she had found Buffy.</p>
<p>"Is it really you?" She asked coming closer to Buffy.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's me," Buffy pulled the other shoe out of her bag and put it on,
now she had a matching.</p>
<p>"Buffy," Faith threw her arms around her pulling her tightly into a hug,
Buffy returned the hug.  Pulling back Faith looked into Buffys eyes.  "I am
never going to lose you again." She gave Buffy the sweetest kiss, their lips
barely touching, before moving in for a much more forceful one.  Gavin smiled
as he watched them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of the day the news had spread all around the school, Buffy
sisters were furious, but couldn't tell anyone because everyone else was so
excited.  In the next week Buffy and Faith became known as one being in the
school, no one ever talked about Faith now, without mentioning Buffy.  Faith
Father met Buffy, and right away could see why his daughter loved her so
much, and after hearing about the conditions in her home he offered for her
to come live with them, in a different room of course.  Buffy felt like a
princess, as she was given her own large room, and was taken shopping for
anything she had ever wanted.  Her sisters refused to talk to her in school
because they were so mad to see all the nice things she had gotten, and how
everyone in the school loved her now.  They eventually transferred to a
different school when their mother decided to move in with one of the losers
she had been dating.</p>
<p>School finished quickly and after graduation, Buffy and Faith had a summer
wedding.  They invited all of Faiths friends and family, and plenty of people
from school.  To everyone's surprise the Olsen twins also showed up for a
while.  It was a beautiful wedding and the reception after words was held at
Faith with people swimming in the pool, and all kinds of food.  Faith and
Buffy were sitting in their bikinis, next to the pool with Taz and Gavin.</p>
<p>"You married," Gavin shook his head. "Still can't believe it."</p>
<p>"Shut up," Faith splashed him.</p>
<p>"Hey, no need to get the innocent bystanders," Taz complained wiping her arm
on Gavin.</p>
<p>"Hmm, no don't see any of those around," Gavin said poking Taz in the arm.
"Hey!" She splashed him with water; he turned and shoved her off the edge
into the pool, she cam up sputtering.  "Gavin I am gonna kill you!"  Before
he could move she had caught his arm and pulled him in after her. Buffy
laughed as Gavin splashed into the pool.  Too late she noticed the devious
look in Faiths eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh no," Buffy tried to scramble away, but instead found herself pushed into
the pool, but not alone, she had grabbed onto Faith and pulled her in too.
They both came up laughing, and Buffy jumped onto Faith clinging to her neck,
Faith held her around the waist, they watched Gavin and Taz splashing each
other playfully, until Gavin took a hold of Taz's arm and pulled her to him,
kissing her deeply.  Her arms wound up around his neck, Buffy decided to stop
this before it went too far.</p>
<p>"Ok, guys, kids in the pool remember."  Gavin pulled back slowly as he heard
all the ohhhs, from Faiths little cousins.  He turned to Buffy.</p>
<p>"They gotta learn sometime," with that he turned back to Taz kissing her
deeply again.  Faith turned Buffys face towards her.</p>
<p>"I think we got something to teach them too," Buffy smiled as she moved up to
kiss Faith again, wrapping her legs around her middle.  More ohhhs came from
the kids, and the photographer snapped a few pictures.  Buffy pulled back
catching her breath.</p>
<p>"Ok, I think all of us need to get out of her before the pool becomes a hot
tub."  Laughing the other three nodded and they all pulled themselves out,
grabbing a towel Gavin tried himself off some while Faith and Buffy just
together on a lounge chair and Taz sat on another one.</p>
<p>"I think I am gonna go get some sodas.  Anyone want?"  Gavin asked turning.</p>
<p>"Oh, orange," Buffy said smiling.</p>
<p>"Coke would be good," Faith wrapped her arms around Buffy.</p>
<p>"Taz?" Gavin asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah," I'll come with you babe." She got up wrapping a towel around her
waist. Taking Gavin's hand they walked off.</p>
<p>"I love you," Faith whispered in Buffys ear.</p>
<p>"I love you too," Buffy whispered back kissing Faiths jaw.  Faith shivered,
thinking of all the fun she was going to have later.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Faith, Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Faith asked, she and Buffy looked up to see Mr. Giles standing over
them.</p>
<p>"Oh, uh, hey Mr. Giles, glad you could make it."  They quickly stood up,
putting a few inches between themselves.</p>
<p>"Yes, um.. congratulations.  And girls, on behalf of the watchers council of
England, I have something to tell you??"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they all lived happily ever after.</p>
