<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 7 -->

<p>The following morning Lt. Tuvok finally allowed visitors in the brig. Last
night Seven was unable to accompany B'Elanna inside the brig for some security
reason. But none the less she camped out outside the brig waiting to be allowed
in. Neither woman had heard form the Captain since the night before but no one
could tell if that was a good thing or bad. When Seven finally entered the brig
she saw only one guard who stood unobtrusively off to the side going over some
data. Lanna herself sat in one of the cells on the bunk with her face in her
hands. Seven gave a slight nod of acknowledgement to the guard as she walked
past. She stopped and stood in front of the force field that separated her from
her love.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna?&quot; Seven whispered sounding almost afraid to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven?&quot; Lanna jumped off her bunk at the sound of the most
angelic voice she had ever heard. &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am... functioning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How are you really feeling?&quot; B'Elanna asked not at all fooled.</p>

<p>&quot;I miss you. And I am sorry that this happened to you.&quot; Seven
whispered, only able to tell the truth to this woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, are you in love with me?&quot; B'Elanna had to ask even though
she feared the worst. It could have been that Lanna had read too much into
their relationship and Seven was going to tell her so. Seven was going to say
she was in love with Janeway and that her answer would be....</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Was the only answer Seven could think to say.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Lanna had to make sure she was hearing things right.</p>

<p>&quot;I said yes. I love you Lt. B'Elanna Torres.&quot; Seven declared with
a surety and bravery that she did not feel.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'm not sorry for anything that has happened recently. I'm not
sorry for hitting the Captain. I'm not sorry for letting you explain things.
And least of all, I'm not sorry for loving you back.&quot; Seven seemed to
bring the romantic side out of anyone including half Klingons.</p>

<p>&quot;But I am sorry for... You love me back?&quot; Seven caught on late but
smiled the biggest smile anyone had ever seen on the ex-drone's face when she
realized what Lanna had said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; The only answer possible for Torres was a simple one.
&quot;I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>Both she and Seven were now standing at the force field. B'Elanna had put
her hand up against the force field palm facing out and Seven had unconsciously
mimicked the action.</p>

<p>&quot;But how can you love me when I betrayed our love with Katherine?&quot;
Seven asked in hushed tones.</p>

<p>&quot;You slept with the Captain?!&quot; B'Elanna said a little too loudly,
then repeated it softer. &quot;You had sex with the Captain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but I did kiss her.&quot; Seven admitted reluctantly</p>

<p>&quot;Wait. Something just doesn't add up. If you say you love me and you're
not the type of person to go around kissing others I can't imagine you just
kissing the Captain. Did by any chance the Captain initiate the kiss?&quot;
Lanna began to get the picture.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but I allowed her to kiss me for 1 minute and 48 seconds before I
fled her quarters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's settled. You didn't betray me or our love. If I'm not
mistaken, you do have strong feelings for the Captain even if it's not love.
And because of these strong feelings you were reluctant to hurt her. I would
guess that being new to these types of situations and feelings you were unsure
of how to act when the Captain kissed you. You knew that if you pulled away you
would hurt her feelings but if you continued to kiss her you would hurt me. Did
you want to kiss her?&quot; B'Elanna was better at these emotional talks than
she thought.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; Seven adamantly denied.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I understand and don't blame you for what happened. In fact I now
wish the Captain would come pay me a visit so that I could truly tell her what
I think of her for taking advantage of you like that. The Captain should not
have put you in that position. &quot; Lanna's protective streak was rearing i's
head again.</p>

<p>&quot;But perhaps the Captain did not know how I truly felt about her and
wished to determine where our relationship stood.&quot; Seven couldn't help but
defend her friend and mentor.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, I think it's time you had a little talk with Janeway to
explain exactly where she does stand. I wouldn't want to have to kill Janeway
AND Paris. And don't you think for one second I forgot about Paris being
responsible for you getting hurt in the holodeck. He's just lucky I hadn't
bumped into him yet because when I do, he's getting bumped right out an
airlock.&quot; B'Elanna concluded leaving Seven hoping that she could talk to
Janeway and Paris before Lanna did. Because spending the rest of 'their' lives
in the brig would be an inefficient use of time.</p>

<p>&quot;I will go talk with the Captain. I will explain to her my feelings for
you and see that she drops the imprisonment sentence. Holding you in the brig
indefinitely seems a bit harsh for the circumstances.&quot; 'Then I will speak
will Lt. Paris.' Seven thought but dared not say it allowed.</p>

<p>Seven spun on her heals and charged out of the brig before Lanna could say
goodbye.</p>

<p>&quot;Now there's a woman on a mission.&quot; Lanna smiled her comment to
the guard on duty. &quot;I just hope that she doesn't get thrown in here with
me for upsetting the Captain. On second thought, that might not be such a bad
idea.&quot; Lanna now knew how to spend her time in prison; thinking of what it
would be like locked up with that beautiful, statuesque woman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, outside the brig, stood Tom Paris and Lt. Tuvok arguing. Well,
at least Tom was arguing while Tuvok stood there impassively listening.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it, Tuvok. I want to go in and see Lanna. I want to see if she's
alright. Only I know that she hates confined place and that she needs
comfort.&quot; Tom thought he was the only one who knew forgetting that Tuvok
once served in the maquis with her.</p>

<p>&quot;She appears to be cooping well with the circumstances, Lt. I recently
checked on Lt. Torres and ascertained that she is physically and emotionally
stable.&quot; Tuvok answered calmly not showing how truly irritated he was
becoming.</p>

<p>&quot;But Tuvok, 'I' need to see her. I guess being Vulcan with no emotions
limits you from understanding that I still do have feelings for Lanna. And I
know she still feels something for me. She needs me and I need to see
her.&quot; Tom tried explaining his love to an emotionless Vulcan.</p>

<p>Just then Seven comes barrelling out of the brig almost knocking Paris on
his ass. Fortunately for him Seven still needed him alive so they could have
their little talk. But first she needed to straighten things out with the
Captain. Leaving the two men with an acknowledging, &quot;Lt's.&quot;, Seven
continued on her way.</p>

<p>&quot;You let HER in to see Lanna and not me?!&quot; Paris raged on.
&quot;You won't let me in to help B'Elanna calm down but you let that borg drone
in only to upset poor Lanna more?!&quot;</p>

<p>Now instead of becoming irritable, Tuvok was becoming a little worried (as
much as Vulcans can worry). Either Tom was blind or he was beginning to have
delusions. Which ever it was, Tuvok was seriously considering bringing Tom down
to see the Doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;If you must know, I allowed Seven in to see Lt. Torres because the Lt.
had requested it. I was inclined to allow it because this situation does
involve Seven of Nine. But because the Lt. did not request to see you nor does
this involve you in anyway, I see no reason to allow the visit.&quot; Tuvok
didn't mention that he thought Tom would only aggravate the situation even
more. Nor did he mention that he violated the Captain's orders of allowing no
visitors and was not about to do so again for Tom's sake. Tuvok made a command
decision that allowing Seven to see B'Elanna might help the situation resolve
itself. He also did not agree with the way the Captain was handling the
incident.</p>

<p>&quot;What?! It's all about Seven isn't it? I bet you anything that it's
because of Seven that Lanna landed in the brig. Why don't you go and ask Lanna
if she wants to see me and then you can just let me in when she says yes. Don't
worry, I'll wait right here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Paris, you will be waiting a long time as I now have other duties
to attend to. When I go see Lt. Torres again I will be sure to relay the
message.&quot; Tuvok said right before he turned and left Paris standing
behind. Tuvok just hoped that Seven appreciated everything he was doing for
her. Even though he hated getting involved in human affairs, he did look upon
Seven as a daughter and that meant he would do anything for her, even get
involved in love quarrels.</p>

<p>Walking the corridors and then riding in the turbolift, Seven found herself
with lots of time to think. Well, lots of time for someone with enhanced brain
function. Seven found that most of her feelings and thoughts had been resolved
after the talk she had with Lanna. No longer did she feel worried that her
feelings of affection would not be returned. No longer was she afraid of
rejection or being made a fool of. True she still felt the tingles in the
stomach, the speeding up of her heart, and the light-headedness when around
Lanna but those were all pleasant feelings. Now she only had one thing left to
worry about and that was how to resolve the issue of Captain Janeway without
hurting her. Perhaps, Seven thought, it would have been best if she paid a
visit to the Doctor first before seeking out Janeway. Unfortunately Seven had
that last thought just as the turbolift doors opened up on the bridge. With a
renewed determination, Seven exited the lift and upon not seeing Janeway
present headed straight for her ready room.</p>
