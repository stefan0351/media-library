<!-- Becoming One \ Part 2: Watching and Starting -->

<p>A year. A year since he had been in Sunnydale. Since he had been in the world. Since he had seen her. Oh…he had to see her. Her pain, her anguish. He imagined her destroyed, unresponsive to anyone, possibly even committed. That would be a beautiful thing to see.</P>
<p>Right before he had been returned, he was only told how much time elapsed, and nothing else. Hell was interesting; lots of opportunities. Especially for a guy like him. Rivers of blood filled with hate, anger, despair, fed him. He was given free reign over minions lesser than him, and that was all fine, but one thing plagued him.</P>
<p>Buffy. She hadn't been punished. He had never gotten to see the fear in her eyes before he drank from her. She was an obsession to him, and he was in no way done obsessing. Last time, he had barely gotten started on her before Acathla popped up. And being the fool that he was, he had to take the opportunity to end the world when it presented itself.</P>
<p>But he wouldn't deviate from the plan this time. No, Buffy had his undivided attention, whether she wanted it or not. She was his, whether she wanted to be or not. After he had had his fun, then he would make time to destroy the world.</P>
<p>He assumed that Buffy was now in college. Enough time had gone by. Immediately after leaving the mansion he headed for the all night auto body shop in town. The fat, middle aged owner was fixing up a Cadillac. He thought about expending energy on the man, but it wasn't what he had in mind.</P>
<p>Quietly, and swiftly, he hopped into the car, and the man underneath didn't even notice. He hit the glove box, and the keys rolled out into his hand. He turned the ignition, and backed up out of the open garage. The man was able to roll out of the way just in time, and stood up, cursing at him.</P>
<p>Angelus gunned the car forward, smashing the man into the wall, blood splattering everywhere. He backed up again, and drove off towards UC Sunnydale.</P>

<p>"Today was, wait for it, actually fun." Buffy said in their apartment. </P>
<P>She had actually taken notes. And she had actually talked to someone who helped her understand the material. Her professors might have been jerks, but once she paid attention, she realized they were very passionate about what they taught. It made learning easier, despite the class size.</P>
<p>"I knew you'd have a good time here."</P>
<p>Willow had known Buffy had a good day before she said anything. She could hear her thoughts clearer, and from farther away than before. She was startled at first, but then happy, because they both were thinking about being alone all day. She was going to do something a little less her in another minute or two.</P>
<P>"There's this cool sorority that I've been looking at, and the best part is they don't have any weird type of initiation process."</P>
<p>"Really? What do they do?"</P>
<p>"Parties, study groups, parties, book club, did I mention parties?"</P>
<p>"No, I don't think you did."</P>
<p>"I must be getting forgetful. I don't know why though. I'm not old, and I'm not drunk."</P>
<p>Buffy had heard Willow all day too. It had been normal today. Giles hadn't called with any new demons to slay, and vampire activity had been quiet for awhile, so she could skip patrol tonight. It would be nice to be alone together for awhile. They both needed it.</P>
<p>"You wanna hear about this other sorority?" Willow asked, stepping closer to her.</P>
<p>"Sure."</P>
<p>"It's called the Willow Club."</P>
<p>Buffy giggled. "Oh yeah? What do I need to become a member?"</P>
<p>"Be blond, a little over five feet tall, greenish-brown eyes, an ability to fight the forces of darkness wouldn't hurt…" Willow wrapped her arms around Buffy's neck, and started to kiss her.</P>
<p>"Do I meet the requirements so far?"</P>
<p>"Oh, yeah. Just one more thing."</P>
<p>"What's that?"</P>
<p>"You have to have a thing for redheaded hackers."</P>
<p>"I'm your girl then."</P>
<p>"Yeah, you are."</P>
<p>Willow pushed her down on the bed.</P>
<p>'<I>Wow. What's gotten in to you?'</P>
</I><p><I>'Are you complaining?'</I> </P>
<P>Willow started slipping off Buffy's shoes.</P>
<p><I>'Am I speaking?'</P>
<p></I>Willow grinned, and continued.</P>

<p>Angelus' brand new Cadillac crashed through the closed entrance gates that led onto the campus. He sped up the driveway, but before he was within enough distance to be seen, he stopped the car, and walked in the shadows further towards the main buildings.</P>
<p>He made his way along the side of the lighted walkway, glancing at his surroundings. Eventually, he saw a girl carrying a few books walk in his direction. He stepped in front of her on the walk, and smiled.</P>
<p>The girl stopped abruptly, and dropped her books.</P>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you."</P>
<p>"No, I'm just…" She got a better look at him, and started to blush.</P>
<p>"It's late. You sure you should be out here?"</P>
<p>"I was just coming from the library…they're open twenty-four hours. It's a pretty safe place."</P>
<p>"It had better be. Shame if something happened…" He leaned down to pick up her books. "Law?"</P>
<p>"Oh yeah. I tried getting into Harvard, but apparently I wasn't perfect enough. Sunnydale…well it wasn't my first choice. Lot a weird stuff and all."</P>
<p>He handed her the books. "Yeah, I've heard stories. Hey, you wouldn't happen to know where the freshman building…"</P>
<p>"It's over past Fletcher Hall. You visiting someone?"</P>
<p>"Kind of. Haven't seen her in awhile, and she wasn't at home so…"</P>
<p>"Well, you've got about fifteen minutes before outside visitors aren't admitted anymore tonight. You could come back tomorrow, and I could take you there myself." She said coyly.</P>
<p>"Thanks for the offer, but…" He grabbed her neck, his demonic features now apparent, and sank his teeth in. After a few seconds, he dropped the girl off to the side. "It's kind of urgent, and I'm not a patient man."</P>
<p>He grabbed a white rose off of a nearby bush, and ran it along the dead girl's blood trail, gathering up as much as possible, tainting the rose's pure white color.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Walking past Fletcher Hall, he looked to his right and saw the freshman apartments. He glided over to the large oak tree that had grown almost to the top of the building, and was a convenient place to be able to look in without being seen. He scaled the tree quickly, looking in the windows on his way up.</P>
<p>On the third level of the building, or the second floor of apartments, he saw her. She was not as he expected. Far from it. Who was that other…Willow? She was making love to Willow? He must have been seeing things.</P>
<p>As he continued to watch, it realized his eyes weren't deceiving him. Slowly, tenderly, Buffy was moving over every inch of Willow's body, and she was smiling. She looked happy. And as Willow pulled her down for a kiss, he could make out three words.</P>
<p>'I love you.'</P>
<p>He dropped down from the tree, and landed on his feet. He growled angrily, his true face showing once more. This wasn't right. This wasn't right at all. Things were going to have to go a little faster than he'd planned. </P>
<p>He burst into the front door of the building, and was met by a guard.</P>
<p>"Sir, you can't be -" The man got a look of horror on his face before Angelus snapped his neck.</P>
<p>"I won't be long. Just want to give her something."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow was lying comfortably, snuggled up against Buffy.</P>
<p>"We're getting stronger, aren't we?"</P>
<p>"Yeah, we haven't…for awhile…you were thinking about it all day."</P>
<p>"So were you."</P>
<p>&#9;"Point taken. You know, if we're not careful, we'll end up becoming one person." Buffy quipped.</P>
<p>Willow grinned. "I've never been telepathic before. It's neat. It's like I'm with you twenty-four hours a day."</P>
<p>"Hey, well don't blame me if I start becoming annoying."</P>
<p>"I'll let you know. You think we should tell Giles?"</P>
<p>"Nah. It's between you and me. I wanna keep it that way."</P>
<p>"Me too, but I'm no telepathy expert…neither are you and…we might need to know…things…"</P>
<p>"You're right. As always. From aggressive Willow to concerned Willow to babbling Willow. You're definitely unpredictable."</P>
<p>"Just like keeping you on your toes, Summers."</P>
<p>There was a knock at the door. Buffy looked at Willow questioningly, and Willow shook her head. "I'll…get it."</P>
<p>Buffy got up, and wrapped a sheet around her body. When she opened the door, and looked out, nobody was there.</P>
<p>"Hello?" She looked down at the ground, and saw a rose. She picked it up, and blood dripped onto her hand.</P>
<p>She walked back inside, and threw the rose out the window, looking from side to side. Seeing nothing, she shut the window.</P>
<p>"Buffy? What's going on? Was that what I think it was?"</P>
<p>Buffy nodded quickly, and started slipping her clothes on. "I'll be back. Shut and lock the door."</P>
<p>"What is it, Buffy?" Buffy's thoughts were focused on one name. "No, he can't be…" Willow went wide-eyed and speechless.</P>
<P>She faced Willow, a clearly frightened expression on her face. "He's back."</P>
<P>Willow focused again and grabbed Buffy's arm. "Don't go."</P>
<P>"I have to know."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy ran downstairs to the guard's body. She didn't even bother to check if he was still alive. She knew he was dead.  Her world had been turned upside down. By him. Again. He seemed more vicious somehow.</P>
<p><I>'Where is he? What am I going to do?'</P>
<p></I>She felt Willow's voice enter her head.</P>
<p><I>'Just come back. He could be anywhere.'</P>
<p></I>Buffy wanted to, she did, but she had to be sure. She got rid of him, what was he doing back here? </P>
<P>She ran outside and looked around. Seeing no sign of him, she sprinted along the walkway, and saw the body. He had drained her completely. She was in her and Willow's English class.</P>
<p><I>'Bastard.'</P>
<p></I>Stepping out from behind a tree, Angelus smirked at her. Buffy just stood motionless.</P>
<p><I>'Run, Buffy!' Willow yelled in her head.</P>
</I><p>But she couldn't.</P>
<p>"Not normally my type, but she was purer then I've had in awhile. There's only one person that will really satisfy me, though, and I speak from personal experience. Can you guess?" He said. </P>
<P>Buffy opened her mouth, but no sound came out. She became almost as pale as he was.  </P>
<P>"What's a matter, lover? You've looked better."</P>
<p>"What are you doing here?"</P>
<p>"What? No hello?" He laughed. "Oh my dear Buffy, I have to say, I'm disappointed."</P>
<p>He moved closer to her.</P>
<p>"You've found a new playmate. Sweet Willow, she was always so cute. I'll forgive you just this once." He backhanded her to the ground. "But I'm back, baby, and you and I are just getting started."</P>
<p>He ran off into the shadows. A few seconds later, Willow ran up behind her. She turned around sharply, knowing instinctively it was Willow, but was still shaken.</P>
<p>"Come on, Buffy. Let's get out of here." Willow pulled her off the ground. "Go ahead. It's okay."</P>
<p>Having permission, Buffy broke down into tears. "Why? Damn it! He should be gone!"</P>
<p>"We'll get him before he does anything."</P>
<p>"Will we? He's already started, and I know what you're thinking." </P>
<p>"He won't stop until -" Willow said, vocalizing her thoughts. </P>
<p>"He kills us." </P>
<P>They were confused, but most of all they were scared. No, terrified and frightened was more accurate. What good was positive energy now?</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Angelus was driving back into town. He had surprised Buffy, and that had improved his mood somewhat, but it wasn't enough. He wanted to, no he would, tear her apart. Willow! That lousy 'bright and happy' bitch. He'd make them both feel pain again; he swore it.</P>
<p>He'd work his way up, though. He may have thrown Buffy off, but she'd be on guard soon enough, and it would be foolish to go after her, and especially Willow, directly. No, he'd start at the bottom, destroy her slowly. And he'd start with the other thorn in his side.</P>
