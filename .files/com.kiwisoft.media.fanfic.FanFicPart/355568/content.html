<!-- This Time Around \ Part Seven: Saved By The Bell -->

<p>***Kennedy High; Track***</p>
<p>Faith and Sam were quietly walking around the track. It seemed to
Sam that everything she did so far with Faith was done quietly, Faith
never talked unless someone asked her a question, and then she
answered with the least amount of words possible. At least gym was
the last class of the day and she could go home and forget about
Faith for a while. Sam was knocked out of her reverie when Brook
walked up next to her. "Hey Sam."</p>
<p>"Brooke." Sam replied flatly. Noticing with a little dismay that
Faith was looking Brooke over, `is she checking her out? Nah.'</p>
<p>"Hi, not sure we met, I'm Faith." Faith said to Brooke. She
couldn't help but notice that she had a lot in common with B.</p>
<p>"Right.new kid.wants to be here." Brooke responded with a smirk. "I
don't think I've ever seen Nicole turn that color before, it was.
interesting." </p>
<p>Faith snorted, "please, that whole intimidation crap she does only
works on people who care what others think of them." Faith
responded, out of the corner of her eye she could see that Sam was
turning an interesting color herself. Was that steam coming out of
her ears?</p>
<p>"And you don't? Care what others think I mean." Brooke asked, not
even noticing that she was now standing in front of Sam, pushing her
out of the way in order to talk to Faith. Sam noticed though, and
oooh was she pissed, Faith noticed to, and it just made her smirk,
she seemed to do that a lot around the girl.</p>
<p>"Naw. To much energy to care `bout shit like that." Brooke nodded
her head, apparently accepting that answer, Faith definitely didn't
look like someone who would care what others thought. "Coming?"
Faith asked as she noticed that Sam had just stopped walking
altogether. "Wouldn't want to loose my tour guide, might get a
little lost." Faith said playfully, trying to get some of the anger
out of the other girl, although she kind of like the fire she saw
when Sam was angry.</p>
<p>Before Sam could answer, and oooh she had good retort just on the tip
of her tongue, the bell rang. "Hey the bell, time to go home, bye."
And with that Sam got as far away from Faith as she could. She was
in need of a cold shower. Whether or not that was from how angry she
had gotten, or that fact that her temperature always went up when
Faith looked at her so intently as she did when asking a question,
she didn't know. Either way she really needed a cold shower.</p>
