<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 43: Surprises -->

<P>Seven woke up when she heard the faint sound of metal on metal. Her eyes shot
open and she climbed quickly out of bed and made her way into the living room.
The lights were on and Ty was sitting with a pile of data padds using them as
building blocks.</P>
<P>"Ty, you should be sleeping," she said as she scooped him up into her arms.
She carried him back to his sleeper and settled him down under the blankets.
</P>
<P>"Evan zing." He rubbed his eyes. "Hold Ty." He lifted his arms to her and his
lip quivered.</P>
<P>"All right," she said with a sweet smile. She lifted him up she went to the
couch and sat down, cradling him in her lap. "But no singing," she whispered.
"We don’t want to wake your Nana B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"My Ba," he said as he rested his head on her shoulder and rubbed the soft
fabric of her deep blue nightgown.</P>
<P>"Yes, she is," Seven whispered and kissed his head. She hummed softly.</P>
<P>She looked over at the clock. It was almost time for the morning watch to
start, but Seven and B’Elanna both had plenty of time now that their maternity
leave had begun, which was why Seven had offered to keep Ty. She figured he
would get into less trouble if his parents had some time alone. Perhaps they
would be less angry given time to deal with the <I>fixed</I> replicator. Opaca
had suggested that Seven and B’Elanna take at least a week to get everything
ready for the baby, and had B’Elanna insisted that they follow her orders to the
letter. </P>
<P>Seven waited until Ty’s breathing evened out and then carried him to his
sleeper. She made sure he was covered, then stood to go back to bed. "Not
again," she whispered as she felt the Braxton Hicks contractions begin again.
She had been to sickbay two more times in the last three weeks. She didn’t want
to wake B’Elanna, so she went directly to the shower and let the water wash away
some of the tension. Forty-five minutes later her back was aching even more so
she decided to try going back to bed.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B’Elanna asked as the former Borg climbed into bed. "Ya’ okay?"
B’Elanna mumbled. She crawled over and draped her arm over Seven’s waist and
kissed her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Fine." Seven rolled over. "Rub my back," she asked.</P>
<P>"Umm," B’Elanna said and then yawned. "Sure, love." Her hands moved down and
worked the muscles gently. Even though B’Elanna was only half awake, her touch
was tender and she immediately found the muscles that seemed to need her touch.
"You’re tied in knots," B’Elanna said as she began waking up. </P>
<P>"False labor." Seven felt her body relaxing.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna sat up, fully awake.</P>
<P>"It’s nothing." Seven pulled her pillow over her head. "I am tired. Let me
sleep."</P>
<P>"Come on, we’re getting up," B’Elanna said as she lifted the pillow away from
her wife’s head.</P>
<P>"Lana," Seven whined. "We can go to sickbay in a few hours."</P>
<P>"Seven, we need to get you checked." B’Elanna sat next to her wife and
brushed the hair off of her face. "Come on."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I am not in labor," Seven insisted. "I am tired of going to
sickbay every time I have some minor contractions."</P>
<P>"You can come back here and sleep as late as you want. I’ll even bring you
breakfast in bed," B’Elanna said as she helped Seven stand.</P>
<P>"I am not in labor," Seven said angrily, then another contraction made her
wince. "Damn it," she said. "I would know if I was in labor."</P>
<P>"And just how often do you use profanity?" B’Elanna asked. "This is worse
than the other times. Come on, let’s go."</P>
<P>"We cannot go." Seven pulled B’Elanna to a stop. "We have to watch Ty."</P>
<P>"Why are you so stubborn?" B’Elanna asked. "If it is false labor, we’ll just
come right back home."</P>
<P>"I am not in labor," Seven insisted again. Her eyes widened and she looked
down just as a splash of clear liquid covered her feet. She looked at B’Elanna,
shocked.</P>
<P>"Well, since you’re <I>not</I> in labor," B’Elanna yelled. "That would be
your water <I>not</I> breaking." The Klingon was heading toward panic at warp
ten.</P>
<P>"Lana?" Seven whispered, her voice full of fear.</P>
<P>"Oh, god, Be’nal… I’m sorry." She wrapped her arms around Seven. "Let’s get
you to sickbay. I’ll grab Ty and bring him with us."</P>
<P>"I do not know if I can walk," Seven said as she lowered herself to the bed,
gritting her teeth.</P>
<P>"Oh no, you can walk. You are not having this baby in our quarters. Do you
hear me?" B’Elanna began pacing, her heart racing, then she finally ran to the
console. "Torres to Opaca… medical emergency in my quarters."</P><I>
<P>*"Lieutenant, what is it?"*</I> the Doctor asked over the comm system.</P>
<P>"I need Opaca and I need her now," B’Elanna said. "Seven’s in labor and she
can’t walk. Now you send that damn hologram down here right now," she ordered as
she ran her hands through her hair. It was down and she tucked it behind her
ears and she bit her lip.</P><I>
<P>*"B’Elanna,"*</I> Opaca said over the comm. *<I>"We’ll beam her to
sickbay."*</P></I>
<P>"Wait," B’Elanna yelled. She sprinted to the other room and snatched up Ty
and ran back to Seven. "Three to beam to sickbay," she said as she knelt next to
Seven. The former drone was breathing in deep gulps and holding her belly.</P>
<P>They materialized in sickbay. Seven ended up sitting on the floor, with
B’Elanna at her side holding Ty who was rubbing his eyes and yawning.</P>
<P>"Ba?" Ty yawned again.</P>
<P>"Shh, honey. It’s okay." B’Elanna stood and looked at Opaca. The hologram was
walking toward her, but she wasn’t moving fast enough for the protective
Klingon. "Come on! There’s a baby coming out here."</P>
<P>"Calm down." Opaca came closer. "This is a natural process." She scanned
Seven and smiled. "Well, it looks like the little one is about to make her grand
entrance."</P>
<P>"She is already in," Seven snapped. "I want her to make an exit… Now." Her
eyes widened even more and she groaned.</P>
<P>"Do something," B’Elanna yelled. "I don’t want my daughter just squirting out
onto the damn floor!"</P>
<P>"Just breathe," Opaca said as she knelt next to Seven. "The contraction will
pass, and then we can move you to the delivery table."</P>
<P>The Doctor stepped out of his office but paused, then cleared his throat.
"Lieutenant, I could take Ty…and call his parents," he offered.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she handed Ty to the Doctor. She rushed back to
Seven even as Ty began to fuss.</P>
<P>"Lana." Seven reached out and grabbed her wife’s hand. "This child is coming
out…right now."</P>
<P>"Do something!" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>Opaca sighed. "It’s not coming out just yet. Keep breathing."</P>
<P>"I am breathing!" Seven yelled.</P>
<P>"She is breathing!" B’Elanna yelled a split second later.</P>
<P>Ty looked at his two aunts and began crying at the top of his lungs. The
Doctor held him away from his body, not knowing what to do. </P>
<P>"It’s all right," the Doctor said in his most soothing voice.</P>
<P>"Bad man hurt Evan!" Ty screamed as he tried to squirm away from the
Doctor.</P>
<P>"I am a hologram," the Doctor whined. "And a very nice one at that… and I
didn’t do this to her."</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty howled and tears streamed down his cheeks.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna!" Seven cried out as the contraction increased.</P>
<P>The Klingon turned her head back and forth between her two screaming family
members like a spectator at a tennis match. She finally decided that Ty would
just have to deal with the Doctor. "I’m right here, Seven," she said as she
squeezed her wife’s hand.</P>
<P>"Ba!" Ty began kicking at the Doctor.</P>
<P>Opaca rolled her eyes and went to the Doctor and snatched Ty.</P>
<P>"Where are you going?" B’Elanna yelled.</P>
<P>"Everyone just calm down." Opaca carried Ty back to B’Elanna and sat him next
to her on the floor. </P>
<P>"Ba," he whispered as he leaped onto her chest and whimpered. He reached out
and touched Seven’s hand. "Evan hurt."</P>
<P>"Shh, Seven’s fine," B’Elanna said and kissed his head.</P>
<P>"Seven is not fine!" The former Borg gave her wife a deadly glare, then her
expression relaxed. She took a deep breath and sighed. "Is it over?" she asked
Opaca.</P>
<P>"No," Opaca said. "That was just one of many contractions."</P>
<P>"Many?" Seven demanded. "How many?"</P>
<P>"Let’s get you onto the delivery table," Opaca said. She knelt beside Seven
who was looking at her like she was insane.</P>
<P>"You expect me to move?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"She can’t move," B’Elanna said. "My kid’s gonna’ come shooting out of there
and go bouncing across the floor."</P>
<P>"Oh, for the love of the prophets," Opaca said. She scooped Seven up and
carried her to the table. Seven’s eyes widened, and then she realized that
despite her size, Opaca was as powerful as she chose to be. Her holographic
matrix could be instantly adjusted.</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Seven looked to her one time mentor. "Is it safe to move me?" she
asked as Opaca was settling her onto the table.</P>
<P>"Of course, Seven," he said with a smile, happy that she was speaking to
him.</P>
<P>"Evan sick," Ty said as B’Elanna moved next to the table.</P>
<P>"Could someone please get Tach and Nara down here?" B’Elanna took Seven’s
hand.</P>
<P>"Of course." The Doctor rushed into his office.</P>
<P>"All right," Opaca said. "Let’s see what’s going on with you." She pressed a
button and the table began tilting until Seven’s back was at a forty-five degree
angle. Opaca knelt in front of her and guided her feet to the stirrups. "Oh my
goodness," Opaca said. </P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna and Seven asked in unison.</P>
<P>"Relax," Opaca told them as she shook her head. "It won’t be much longer at
all. Seven is dilated to ten centimeters."</P>
<P>"Is that good?" B’Elanna asked. She tried to see what the hologram was
looking at. Ty squirmed in her arms and Seven had her wrist in a death grip.</P>
<P>"It’s very good. Ten centimeters is fully dilated. She can have the baby any
time now," Opaca explained. She scanned Seven’s belly. </P>
<P>"What do you mean ten centimeters if fully dilated?" Seven demanded. "How is
our child going to fit out of an opening ten centimeters?" Seven struggled to
lean forward. "You told us last week that our daughter would be at least seven
and a half pounds. She will not fit."</P>
<P>"She’ll fit," Opaca assured her. She checked her readings and smiled. "The
baby has turned and is in perfect position. She’ll be with us any time now."</P>
<P>"Can’t you beam her out?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>Opaca stared at Seven for a moment and then sighed. "No. You will do just
fine."</P>
<P>"You are not the one trying to pass a seven and a half pound child through a
ten centimeter opening," Seven whined.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna said as she caressed Seven’s hand.</P>
<P>"But I am here," Seven said, pointing at the table. "And the baby is coming
out…of…down there!" She pointed to her waist. "I did not adequately research
this. I have changed my mind. You have the child."</P>
<P>"It’s a little late for that," Opaca said. "Uh oh…" She looked at her
tricorder.</P>
<P>"What?" Seven and B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"You’re about to start another…" Opaca began.</P>
<P>"Oh, my god!" Seven yelled as she squeezed B’Elanna’s hand.</P>
<P>"…contraction," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"Evan!" Ty began to cry.</P>
<P>"Seven!" B’Elanna screamed as her hand was being squeezed tightly.</P>
<P>The doors to sickbay hissed open and a sleepy Nara wandered in with Tach at
her side. Tach yawned and took in the unfolding scene.</P>
<P>"Well, good morning," Tach said happily.</P>
<P>"Fa!" Ty yelled at the top of his lungs. "Evan sick!"</P>
<P>"Seven," B’Elanna said, trying to hold onto Ty as he squirmed. "Let go of my
hand."</P>
<P>"You are not going anywhere," Seven said through clenched teeth, but she did
loosen her grip. "You got me into this. You are staying right here."</P>
<P>Nara laughed and she went to B’Elanna and took Ty.</P>
<P>"This is not funny," B’Elanna said to Nara and then growled.</P>
<P>"Oh, yes it is," Nara said. She bent down and lifted Seven’s nightgown. "Oh
dear. Won’t be much longer now."</P>
<P>"Hey!" B’Elanna slapped Nara’s hand away.</P>
<P>"Every one who is not married to Seven…out," Opaca commanded.</P>
<P>Nara hugged Ty to her chest and rubbed his back. He had stopped crying. "But
we want to see the baby born," she whined.</P>
<P>"Out," Opaca ordered. "When I get these two settled down, maybe you can come
back in." She turned back to Seven. "Take deep breaths."</P>
<P>"You take deep breaths." Seven grunted as she gave Opaca an icy glare.</P>
<P>"Out," Opaca ordered. </P>
<P>"Come on," Tach said as he guided Nara out of the room. "We’ll wait right
outside and she can call us as soon as it’s okay."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Opaca said gently. "Stand behind her and help her lean forward.
She’s going to need to start pushing soon."</P>
<P>"I am already pushing," Seven said. "I have no choice. This damn human body
is pushing of its own accord."</P>
<P>B’Elanna moved behind Seven and gently wrapped her arm around her waist and
leaned her forward. "Okay, Be’nal. We can get through this."</P>
<P>Seven spun her head toward B’Elanna. "We?"</P>
<P>"Yes, we." B’Elanna leaned into Seven and bumped her forehead against her
wife’s. "You may be having our daughter, but I am here with you…and I will be
here no matter what."</P>
<P>Seven closed her eyes and nodded. She took deep breaths as the contraction
ended. "Okay," she whispered and she relaxed.</P>
<P>"It’s just like the Lamaze simulator," B’Elanna said as she rubbed Seven’s
shoulders. They had spent hours in the holodeck practicing so that Seven would
know how to breathe properly. </P>
<P>"It is nothing like the simulator." Seven glared at B’Elanna. "That training
exercise was inadequate." She glared at Opaca. "You sent us to a useless program
that did nothing to prepare us."</P>
<P>"Just breathe and you’ll get through this, Seven," Opaca said as she shook
her head.</P>
<P>"This Lamaze is a human delusional construct. It was created to fool
prospective mothers into believing birth is tolerable," Seven stated. She was
panting and leaning against B’Elanna. "It is all your fault, B’Elanna."</P>
<P>"Me?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"You got me pregnant," Seven accused.</P>
<P>"But…" B’Elanna looked back and forth between Seven and Opaca. "I
didn’t…you…"</P>
<P>"Don’t argue with a woman in labor," Opaca advised.</P>
<P>"You’re right, Seven," B’Elanna said. "It is my fault."</P>
<P>"It was my Borg technology that allowed the pregnancy," Seven snapped. </P>
<P>"Well, I…" B’Elanna stammered.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I love you," Seven said when the contraction ended. She smiled at
her wife. Her hormones were taking one last shot at the former drone’s
emotions.</P>
<P>"I love you too," B’Elanna said. She caressed Seven’s cheek wondering when
the next mood swing would hit.</P>
<P>"Well," Opaca said as she scanned Seven again. "This little one is in a
hurry. She is positioned at the top of the birthing canal and we should be
seeing her after a few more contractions."</P>
<P>"Can you give her something for the pain?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"The nanoprobes are working overtime right now," Opaca said. "They’re sending
her extra endorphins as we speak. I think we should avoid adding anything else
to the mix if you can handle it, Seven."</P>
<P>"Will the drugs harm the baby?" Seven asked. She was breathing evenly and
seemed much calmer now that Ty wasn’t in the room crying.</P>
<P>"Normally, I’d say no," Opaca explained. "But your physiology is unique. I
can’t be sure."</P>
<P>"No drugs," Seven said. "I can tolerate the discomfort. It is much less that
when the temporal spike occurred."</P>
<P>"Thank Kahless," B’Elanna said as she leaned over and kissed Seven’s temple.
"What can I do?"</P>
<P>"You are doing it," Seven said.</P>
<P>B’Elanna wiped the moisture from Seven’s forehead. Her nanoprobes were
occupied and weren’t bothering with her sweat glands.</P>
<P>The doors to sickbay opened and Ensign Samantha Wildman entered. She hurried
in, reaching up to tuck her hair behind her ears. "Opaca, I got here as fast as
I could," she said. "Seven, how are you feeling?" </P>
<P>"She’s doing well, Ensign," Opaca said. "Now, I need you to monitor the fetal
heart rate while B’Elanna changes into a sterile gown. You can help me get Seven
changed."</P>
<P>"Of course," Samantha said as she moved to the table. "Hi Seven. Naomi’s
outside. I told her it was time."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven said. "I appreciate your willingness to assist in this
matter." She shifted her weight and rubbed her back.</P>
<P>"Yeah," B’Elanna said. "Thanks. We didn’t really want Tom helping out…if you
know what I mean, and you’ve got training as a medic...plus…well…you have had a
baby."</P>
<P>"I’m glad to help," Samantha said. "I’ve been working with Opaca in the
holodeck practicing with birth simulations." She grabbed a gown out of the
cabinet and quickly changed into it and put on gloves before handing a sterile
set to B’Elanna. "Here," she said, glancing at B’Elanna’s floor length
nightgown.</P>
<P>"Oh, thanks," B’Elanna said. She didn’t quite know why she needed a medical
gown, but it was better than wearing her nightgown, especially if they had any
more visitors. She changed quickly as Opaca and Samantha helped get Seven out of
her sleepwear and into a sterile gown.</P>
<P>"The baby’s doing fine, Seven." Samantha watched the tricorder, smiling at
the readings. "Her heart rate is perfect and she’s in position. Do you have a
name picked out yet?"</P>
<P>"Actually," B’Elanna said as she went back to Seven’s side. "It’s considered
bad luck to mention the child’s name before it’s born."</P>
<P>"It’s part of a Klingon myth," Opaca said as she checked Seven again,
pressing her hand on her belly to feel the baby’s position. "If you say the
child’s name, they will come out, and could be born before their time."</P>
<P>"Perhaps we should call her." Seven sighed.</P>
<P>"Pressure’s rising," Samantha said as she monitored the readings. "There’s a
contraction coming."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna," Seven said when the contraction hit. It was stronger than the
others had been. "Oh," she screamed and grabbed the table with her Borg enhanced
hand. She crushed the metal as she panted.</P>
<P>"I’m here," B’Elanna said, rubbing Seven’s back.</P>
<P>"You need to push," Opaca said patiently.</P>
<P>"Ahh," Seven cried. "I am pushing." Sweat beaded on her forehead and B’Elanna
held onto her as the contraction continued.</P>
<P>"The baby’s shifting," Samantha said. "She turned."</P>
<P>"It’s okay," Opaca said, her hands still on Seven’s belly. "Some movement is
normal, especially with Klingons."</P>
<P>"B’Elanna Torres, make your child stop moving," Seven said as the baby
twisted inside.</P>
<P>"She’s back where she started," Samantha said. She moved the tricorder closer
and smiled. "The contraction’s almost over."</P>
<P>"Easy," Opaca said. "Keep pushing…nice and steady."</P>
<P>"I am," Seven whined. "Ahh," she collapsed against B’Elanna as the
contraction stopped. "Be’nal," she whispered.</P>
<P>"I’m here." B’Elanna turned to Opaca. "What’s taking so long?"</P>
<P>"Labor usually takes hours." Opaca gently pressed Seven’s belly. "As it is,
Seven is progressing nicely."</P>
<P>"Hours?" Seven asked. She looked at B’Elanna, her eyes pleading. "I am
exhausted. I cannot do this for hours."</P>
<P>"You’re doing great," Samantha said. "It took me three hours of hard labor to
get this far along."</P>
<P>"How much longer?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Not long," Opaca said.</P>
<P>The Doctor stepped out of his office. "Do you need anything?" he asked
carefully from the doorway.</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked at Seven and raised her eyebrows.</P>
<P>"Not at the moment," Seven said to him. "But when the baby comes, we may need
your assistance," she said.</P>
<P>"I’ll be waiting in my office," he said cheerfully. "Just say the word."</P>
<P>"Thanks," B’Elanna said.</P>
<P>"It’s my pleasure," he said sincerely. He paused, looking at the scene and
then turned and went to his office. He sat at his desk, not knowing what to do.
He considered sending an announcement about Seven’s labor over the command
system but decided that he didn’t want to push his luck. Seven was Opaca’s
patient and he wasn’t going to do anything to anger the former drone, not when
she seemed to be letting him back into her life.</P>
<P>"I need to reposition the table." Opaca began tilting the table even further
until Seven was sitting completely upright.</P>
<P>"Won’t the baby fall onto the floor?" B’Elanna looked at the way the table
now resembled a chair with a giant hole in the seat.</P>
<P>"That’s what we’re here for," Opaca said.</P>
<P>"We’re?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Opaca said with a smile. "You are going to bring your daughter into
this world."</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna asked. The Klingon’s face paled. "I thought you were gonna’
do it…What about Samantha? She’s a mother…she knows about babies."</P>
<P>"Who do you want the first person to hold your child to be?" Opaca asked. "A
hologram, Samantha…or her mother?"</P>
<P>"Please, Be’nal," Seven asked. "I know you can do it."</P>
<P>"I’ll do everything right up until you step in and catch her," Opaca
promised.</P>
<P>"But…" B’Elanna looked at Seven.</P>
<P>"Come here." Opaca held out her hand to the frightened Klingon. B’Elanna took
her hand and moved down between Seven’s legs. </P>
<P>"Oh, sweet Kahless," B’Elanna said as she saw how dilated Seven was.</P>
<P>"Shh," Opaca said as she poked B’Elanna. "You’ll make her nervous. She looks
perfectly normal."</P>
<P>B’Elanna nodded. </P>
<P>"Now," Opaca said gently. "When the baby crowns, we’ll see the top of her
head coming out. We’ll need to keep gentle pressure on her head so that she
doesn’t come out too fast, otherwise Seven might tear."</P>
<P>B’Elanna looked at Seven and then Opaca, and then her eyes rolled back in her
head and she collapsed toward the floor face first. Samantha grabbed the
Klingon’s arm as she went down. </P>
<P>"Oh dear," Opaca said with a frown. "Doctor, we need you." She looked down at
the unconscious Klingon and shook her head.</P>
<P>"What did you do to her?" Seven demanded. She leaned over to get a better
look at her wife. "Is she injured?"</P>
<P>"Just her pride," Opaca said with a smirk. "Uh oh, here comes another
contraction."</P>
