<!-- Confesses \ null -->

<p>After that lengthy night of secrets and 'the war' both Sam and
	Brooke were in the bathroom getting ready for bed. Sam had been
	thinking all night after Brooke had said Josh and she had kissed the
	same night, just moments before Sam had kissed him as well. Thinking
	that she kind of kissed Brooke that night, kind of. Maybe some of
	Josh's taste had been Brooke's. It made Sam's heart skip a beat at
	this revelation. When Brooke had said thank you for not going over
	the line she just wanted to give her a kiss right then and there.
	That would most definitely go over the line. Almost making herself
	chuckle. Sam looked sideways over at Brooke.</p>

	<p>"So, that was some night huh?"</p>

	<p>"Yeah." Sam could kind of tell she really didn't want to discuss it
	but Sam was a bit curious. Okay, very much curious.</p>

	<p>"We all 'can' get along when we are forced too."</p>

	<p>"No Sam, 'we' get along fine. Me and you."</p>

	<p>"Yeah, after we were forced together, remember?" Giving one of her
	adorable half smiles.</p>

	<p>"I like to consider it's just that we needed to get to know each
	other more, that's all." Looking up at Sam through the reflection in
	the mirror.</p>

	<p>"So," Sam wanted to broach a certain subject but wasn't sure how to
	do it. </p>

	<p>"What about those secrets?"</p>

	<p>"Yeah, Webbed feet,"
	"Eww!" simultaneously out of both mouths. After a brief silence,
	Sam, needing a moment to get up the courage to ask Brooke.</p>

	<p>"So, what were you saying about the your sexuality thoughts?"
	Turning around leaning against the sink as she asked. Sam 'needed'
	to know. If it were true then maybe she would have something to
	strive for if only in her dreams. "What were your thoughts?"</p>

	<p>"Sam, I was just trying to give a little support. Lily seemed so
	awkward at that moment I figured she needed a kind of rescue."
	Looking back down at the sink feeling a little awkward herself.</p>

	<p>"Oh," Sam tried to hide the disappointment best as she could but if
	Brooke had been watching her she would have seen it all over her
	face. After the little uplift from earlier the let down from
	Brooke's reply was a little stronger then it would have been if she
	had never heard what Brooke had said in the Novak.</p>

	<p>"Thought you were going to get a little scoop?" Brooke looked at Sam
	with a spark of anger in her eyes.</p>

	<p>"No, I just thought since we were being civil to each other and all,
	I was just conversing, that's all." Turning back around to pick up
	her things getting ready to leave. Brooke saw the sadness in Sam's
	eyes and regretted the accusation. Especially since she was lying.
	Brooke took one deep breath and slowly let it out before turning to
	Sam and attempted to take back her previous fib.</p>

	<p>"Umm, actually Sam that was a lie." Brooke had an echo of noise
	going through her head. She was about to confess to a past enemy,
	school reporter, soon to be stepsister, and hopefully friend. "I
	have thought about it a few times, in the past," putting up her
	hands to her lips, with the gesture of wait, "I take that back too.
	I have been thinking about it more lately."</p>

	<p>"Oh." OH.MY.GOD. "Are you gay then?"</p>

	<p>"I don't know, Sam. Maybe." And that was the truth. Brooke really
	wasn't sure what it meant.</p>

	<p>"That's cool." With such calm, but, Sam was screaming to
	herself 'OHMYGOD!'</p>

	<p>"That's it?" Brooke was expecting something more, anything.
	Something other than 'That's cool'.</p>

	<p>"Yeah," looking over at Brooke, with a shrug of her shoulders, "What
	did you expect?"</p>

	<p>"I don't know, I guess nothing." Said with a sigh with a little bit
	of relief, mixed with something else. Brooke just wasn't sure of
	what that something else was at this point.</p>

	<p>Sam was halfway through the doorway when she turned around and
	cleared her throat. </p>

	<p>"Brooke?" Brooke looked over to Sam, waiting for her to
	continue. "Have a good night."</p>

	<p>"You too Sam, you too." Sam looked like she was going to say
	something more but, changed her mind, so Brooke let it go.</p>

	<hr></hr>

	<p>Sam went to her room and got under her covers but it took some time
	for sleep to overtake her. Her thoughts were full of the blonde next
	door. What Sam wanted to ask after Brooke's confession of her
	thoughts was 'what kind of thoughts?' or 'Who was in your
	thoughts?'. She could only hope that she herself was in some,
	hopefully at least one of those thoughts.</p>

	<p>In the room next door, Brooke was a mess. She had confessed her
	inner thoughts to Sam. Is she going to tell everyone? The paper?
	Would she do something like that? No they were beyond that, weren't
	they? They were now friends. Brooke wasn't sure whether she was
	ready for everyone to know. She would have to feel it out in the
	morning. See if Sam brought it up again. </p>

	<hr></hr>

	<p>The following morning Brooke got up the earliest as always. But,
	instead of sticking to her decision to feel it out with Sam this
	morning. She had second thoughts about waiting to see what Sam
	brought up and left before anyone else reached the kitchen. </p>

	<p>As Sam was walking down the stairs she heard the door open. It was
	early for anyone to be leaving. As she peered out the window, she
	saw Brooke's taillights leaving the driveway.</p>

	<hr></hr>

	<p>Ms. Glass's class was next. That is when Brooke had to come face to
	face with Sam. They did sit right next to each other after all. She
	was feeling very nervous about it too. Although all day she didn't
	get any suspicions that Sam had mentioned it to anyone. There had
	been no whispers or looks that weren't out of the ordinary. Not yet
	anyway. Brooke walked into the room just as the bell rang. Her
	timing was perfectly planned. There was only time for a simple.</p>

	<p>"Hey." Brooke smiled at Sam as she sat.</p>

	<p>"Hey." Was the return with the smile as well. </p>

	<p>Ms. Glass was already well into her lesson for the day. The moment
	class was over Brooke left in a blur to escape any conversion that
	Sam would need to initiate. Lily walked with Sam out of the
	classroom and into the hall. </p>

	<p>"Why was Brooke in such a hurry?" Sam shrugged.</p>

	<p>"I don't know. I haven't seen too much of her today." Sam really
	wasn't sure why but it did seem like Brooke was avoiding her. Maybe
	she was just embarrassed about what she confessed last night. </p>

	<hr></hr>

	<p>Sam knocked on Brooke door when she arrived home that afternoon. She
	hadn't seen Brooke the entire rest of the day. </p>

	<p>"Come in." Brooke spoke through the door without getting up to let
	her in.</p>

	<p>"Are you alright, Brooke?" Sam asked from the doorway.</p>

	<p>"I'm fine." </p>

	<p>"Brooke, do you want to talk or anything?"</p>

	<p>"I don't know Sam. I don't know what to say." Sam walked to the desk
	and brought the chair to Brooke's bed where Brooke was sitting. Sam
	sat down on the chair. </p>

	<p>"Maybe start by telling me why you might be avoiding me? Or was I
	mistaken?" Brooke looked down.</p>

	<p>"What if I said I didn't really tell you everything?" Looking back
	up at Sam. </p>

	<p>"What haven't you said, Brooke?" </p>

	<p>"I don't know what you will think of me if I do."</p>

	<p>"I won't think anything of you. I'm your friend, Brooke, you can
	tell me anything. I want to help you." Sam didn't know how else to
	make Brooke understand that she wanted to help. </p>

	<p>"Sam," Brooke sat up straight on the bed and faced Sam. "I have had
	those thoughts for some time now. I have mentioned that but what I
	haven't told you is who I had them of." Brooke stopped speaking not
	sure whether she wanted to say it.</p>

	<p>"It's okay Brooke." Everyone that she could be talking about was
	going through Sam's mind. Thinking that she was probably last on the
	list.</p>

	<p>"There was a few but, mostly one person. That person was ... is you,
	Sam. I'm sorry I just can't help it. You have been so nice, kind and
	you have the most beautiful.. You probably don't want to hear all of
	this. But, I do care for you." </p>

	<p>"Really?" Sam squeaked out. She hoped but she can't believe that
	it's true. Brooke stood and walked over to her desk, facing away
	from Sam. She started to straighten out some papers that didn't need
	any straightening out.</p>

	<p>"Sam, can we talk later?" Brooke heard Sam stand. She just couldn't
	face her any longer. She didn't want to hear any rejection now.</p>

	<p>"Brooke, ... "</p>

	<p>"Please, Sam, just leave, we'll talk later." Sam didn't know what to
	do now. Except she did know that she wanted to hold Brooke. Kiss
	her. But, maybe it wasn't really what Brooke wanted. So she did as
	Brooke wished and left. </p>

	<hr></hr>

	<p>A while after Sam had left Brooke's room, Brooke knocked on her
	door. </p>

	<p>"Sam, what did you think about what I said?" Sam turned back around
	to face Brooke.</p>

	<p>"My thought was that I may be luckier then I ever thought." She
	looked down as she said this.</p>

	<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

	<p>"Because the person who I care for actually cares for me too." Sam
	raised her head enough to look through her eye lashes shyly at
	Brooke. </p>

	<p>"Are you saying what I think you're saying?" The corner of Brooke's
	mouth turning up.</p>

	<p>"If that is what you want me to say?" Brooke took a step forward.</p>

	<p>"Sam, are you sure about this?"</p>

	<p>"Absolutely." Brooke stepped one more step closer. Sam took the
	final step to close the gap between them.</p>
