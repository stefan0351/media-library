<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 11: Revealing and Returning-->

<p>Buffy was sitting on the couch at the Bronze. She looked over at Xander and Cordelia dancing, and then over at Oz across from her. She sighed. They knew what had happened, and they didn’t know what to say to her.</P>
<p>She didn’t even know what to say to herself. She tried to find an explanation for what she saw. She tried every angle; every reason Willow might’ve done what she did. She couldn’t come up with one. She couldn’t help feeling like she was leaving something out.</P>
<p>When she wasn’t trying to figure out why it happened, she tried being hurt, and then being angry. She was devastated. If she weren’t still alive, Buffy would have thought her heart had stopped. It was almost like Willow wanted to get caught. Like she knew that would be the one thing that would hurt her the most. But why would Willow want to hurt her? And the only other person was Faith. She couldn’t think of a reason for either of them to hurt her.</P>
<p>She knew Willow would not, ever, do what she did, freely. But how could Buffy deny what she saw? </P>
<I><P>‘Don’t second guess what you know.’ </I> She told herself. <I>‘Kissing Faith was a very un-Willow thing to do.’ </P>
</I><P>Buffy didn’t want to stay away from her, but she couldn’t be around her either. She knew there was probably a good explanation for everything, but Willow was the only one who knew what that was. Well, the only one she could trust to tell the truth anyway. But sadly, Willow didn’t seem to want to share.</P>
<P>She could easily confront Willow, of course. But she didn’t want her to feel like she was forcing her to say something she wasn’t ready to say. The last thing Buffy wanted to do was make her uncomfortable, and she knew how Willow got when she felt rushed. Buffy loved her, and one thing she learned about Willow was that you had to let her do things on her own. When Willow was ready, she’d tell her. </P>
<p>The song ended, Xander kissed Cordelia, and then she left. He came over, and sat next to Buffy.</P>
<p>"So, Oz how long has it been now?" He asked.</P>
<p>"A week I think."</P>
<p>They looked at her.</P>
<p>"I get it. Okay, guys? What do you expect me to do?"</P>
<p>"Talk to her would be a start." Xander said.</P>
<p>"I tried. She didn’t want to."</P>
<p>"Oz, how many times did she try?"</P>
<p>"Once."</P>
<p>"This two on one confrontation. Whose idea was it?"</P>
<p>"It was mutual." Oz said.</P>
<p>"The ball’s in her end zone, or something like that. I’m here, all she has to do is talk."</P>
<p>"I’ve known Willow all my life, but somehow after only knowing her for three years, you know her better than I ever could. You know she’s loyal and committed to you." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Then why was she kissing Faith?"</P>
<p>"Maybe she didn’t have a choice." Oz said.</P>
<p>"How do you figure that? And if she was forced, why won’t she tell me?"</P>
<p>"Maybe she can’t." Xander said.</P>
<p>"What possible reason…"</P>
<p>"As much as I think a certain new slayer, is centerfold worthy…"</P>
<p>"Before he gets too off the subject, we think the problem is Faith. She’s not that mentally sound, if you ask me." Oz said.</P>
<p>"And what has she talked about ever since she got here?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>"You mean besides herself?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>They nodded.</P>
<p>"Me."</P>

<p>Willow was lying on her bed, staring at the ceiling. Her parents went away for the week. They asked her if she wanted to come, but she said that she needed to stay home. At this point, she wished she had gone, because the situation with Buffy hadn’t improved any.</P>
<p>And she knew that wasn’t Buffy’s fault. It was hers. Why wasn’t she telling Buffy? For what seemed like the fiftieth time, she ran down the reasons in her head. One, once she told Buffy that meant Faith would probably take her plan to the next level (which meant Faith would try to really hurt Buffy). Two, if Faith were able to come up with a clever cover story, she and Buffy would be even further apart then they were now. Three, she was afraid of what Faith would do to her.</P>
<p><I>‘But Buffy can take care of herself, and she’s always kept me safe.’</P>
</I><p>But the other thing was that Faith seemed pretty confident. Whoever she was working for probably was pretty powerful. And as uninformed as Willow was, she couldn’t know whether Buffy could handle whomever it was that was running the show. And she didn’t want to put Buffy’s life in danger.</P>
<p><I>‘But her life’s already in danger. Aren’t I helping to put her in harm’s way by not telling her about Faith?’</P>
<p></I>And the more she thought about it, the more she knew that was the truth. Inside, she was struggling with herself. She had a natural inclination to want to protect Buffy. And now that they were ‘involved’ the desire to protect her had heightened a lot. She knew that right now, Buffy was safe. And Willow wanted to keep it that way. Although she knew that eventually, Faith’s course of action would be out of her hands, and she would go after Buffy no matter what she did.</P>
<p>It wasn’t that she thought that Buffy couldn’t beat Faith. Willow knew she could, in a one on one fight. But knowing first hand how sneaky Faith was, it was what might be backing Faith up that scared her. </P>
<p><I>‘Too many thoughts.’</P>
<p></I>Out of all the thoughts she was having, one thing stood above the rest. And it was a purely selfish one too. She was miserable without Buffy. They had stopped talking all together. They were avoiding one another. The only time they were talking was in Chemistry, because they were lab partners. And even then they tried to talk to each other as little as possible. It was killing her inside.</P>
<p>Kissing Faith was something Willow had been trying hard to forget. It was disgusting to her. She felt violated. Using something as beautiful as a kiss for such a dark purpose, well, in her mind, that was the worst thing you could do. To make an expression of love so evil and dirty. She got angry just thinking about it.</P>
<p>She missed Buffy’s kisses. She missed just being near her and feeling completely secure and safe around her. She missed everything. She wanted to tell her so much. It might complicate other things, but at least they’d be okay. But that wasn’t right to her. There were things to think about, not just her own happiness.</P>
<p>She heard the doorbell ring. Hoping that it was Buffy, she rushed downstairs, and opened the door. Willow frowned slightly when she saw it wasn’t.</P>
<p>"Nice to see you too, Willow." Cordelia said, noticing Willow’s expression.</P>
<p>"Sorry, Cordy. I was just kind of hoping –"</P>
<p>"That I was Buffy?" She came in, and shut the door. "Well, maybe if we can straighten you out, she will be the one at the door next time."</P>
<p>"How is she?"</P>
<p>"Depressed, quiet, the usual. Same as you."</P>
<p>"So…"</P>
<p>"So, I want to talk to you. You know normally if a relationship is on the rocks, both people are at least a little at fault. But you never heard that from me."</P>
<p>"I know I’m the one who needs to fix it."</P>
<p>"Then why don’t you?"</P>
<p>"It’s complicated."</P>
<p>"Can you at least tell me about it?"</P>
<p>Willow sighed.</P>
<p>"It’ll put you in danger."</P>
<p>"When is my life not in danger anymore?"</P>
<p>"No, I mean constantly. And you won’t know when or where. I don’t even know if it’s safe to be talking about it this much."</P>
<p>"This is big, huh?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded. "And I don’t even know the whole story yet."</P>
<p>"Well, I may not be able to handle big stuff, but Buffy can. You know that."</P>
<p> "I don’t know if she can handle this."</P>
<p>"You have to trust her. She’ll know what to do. If not, her and Giles will work out something. And as much as I hate to say this, we’ll all be backing her up. If it’s as big as you say it is, she needs to know."</P>
<p>"I know…"</P>
<p>"Buffy told me about your date you had awhile ago. How you both said you were going to get a place to live together for college, and how you set a goal and everything. She said that she had her doubts about how things were going to end up, but you squashed them. She said you were confident.</P>
<p>"This is something that is standing in the way of that goal, and you have the power to get rid of it."</P>
<I><p>‘She’s right. A goal is a goal. I’m sticking to it.’</P>
</I><p>"Hey, how come you never said anything about me and Faith?"</P>
<p>"We all know that wasn’t you. Even Buffy. She just needs you."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Faith had come back from patrolling, and went back to Faith’s apartment.</P>
<p>"You’ve been awfully quiet, B."</P>
<p>Buffy gave her a look that could kill.</P>
<p>"You know why."</P>
<p>"Oh yeah, how is Willow?"</P>
<p>"How could you?"</P>
<p>"How could I what?"</P>
<p>"Kiss her."</P>
<p>"I was the kissed."</P>
<p>"Don’t give me that. You could have easily got her off you."</P>
<p>"What’s the big deal?"</P>
<p>"You knew we were together."</P>
<p>"You were? As I remember it, every time I asked you about that, you wouldn’t answer me. I wasn’t aware I was doing anything wrong."</P>
<P>Buffy laughed slightly.	</P>
<P>"So you did do it."</P>
<p><I>‘Damn! Recover.’</P>
<p></I>"I had to do something, I was being kissed."</P>
<p>"You didn’t have to respond to it." Buffy paused. "How did you find Willow anyway?"</P>
<p>"I was hunting and I was walking by the factory. I heard her scream, I went in."</P>
<p>"You could hear her? She was in the basement. Not to mention, locked behind a solid steel door."</P>
<p>"Slayer hearing, B."</P>
<p>"How come I don’t believe you?"</P>
<p>"Cause you want to don’t want to blame poor, sweet Willow for what happened." </P>
<P>Buffy started to walk out.</P>
<I><P>‘Shake it up a little.’</P>
<p></I>"So, what hurts more, skewering your ex with a sword, or being separated from Willow?"</P>
<p>Buffy turned around sharply.</P>
<p>"How do you know about Angel?"</P>
<p>"Your friends told me. So, what hurts more?"</P>
<p>Buffy punched Faith with all her strength. Faith fell, unconscious.</P>
<p>"I bet that hurts." Buffy said as she walked out.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy walked down the street. She needed to get to Giles’ house. She saw Willow coming towards her.</P>
<p>"What are you doing out here, Will?"</P>
<p>"Looking for you. I need to explain."</P>
<p>"I’m glad, but can it wait? I need to get to Giles."</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<p>"I need to know about Faith."</P>
<p>"That’s what I need to tell you."</P>
<p>Buffy stopped a second, thinking. Then she started again.</P>
<p>"You can tell me when we get there." Buffy smiled at her.</P>
<p>"Where is Faith anyway?"</P>
<p>"Unconscious on the floor of her apartment."</P>
<p>Willow grinned.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"So you don’t think she’s on our side?" Giles asked.</P>
<p>"I don’t think it. I know she’s not." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Go ahead, Will." Buffy encouraged.</P>
<p>"Okay. Out in the woods, the night of the dance, Faith was the one who took me. She said if I told anyone, she’d kill me."</P>
<p>Willow looked at their shocked faces, and continued.</P>
<p>"She thought that I’d push you away, because I knew something and I couldn’t tell you. When I didn’t, she decided to try something else. She must have followed me and Spike to the factory, and as soon as he left, she came in."</P>
<p>"And what I saw?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"She planned that. It was all to hurt you. The only reason I did it, and believe me Buffy I didn’t want to, was because she had a knife pressed to the back of my neck. I didn’t want to tell you because –"</P>
<p>"Because you didn’t want to put me in danger."</P>
<p>Willow nodded.</P>
<p>Buffy went to sit next to her on the couch, and hugged her.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry I didn’t come to you sooner." Willow said.</P>
<p>"So am I. I’ve been an idiot."</P>
<p>Giles waited a few seconds, and spoke.</P>
<p>"Why did you suspect her, Buffy?" Giles asked.</P>
<p>"She knew about Angel. Nobody told her, did they?"</P>
<p>"No, of course not." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Which means she has access to information." Giles said.</P>
<p>"She did say she worked for someone."</P>
<p>"How could the Council not know this, Giles?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Well as I said, they lost track of her. To be quite honest, Faith was a problem to them in the beginning. When they lost track of her, I believe they were glad that they didn’t know where she was. Trying to find her was not a priority."</P>
<p>"How can you work for those people? How can I work for those people?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Well…"</P>
<p>"That was a rhetorical question, Giles."</P>
<p>"What about Faith?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Don’t confront her just yet. If we do, she may panic, and who knows what may happen. Considering we know next to nothing about her plans, or whom she is working for, it would be unwise to provoke her. </P>
<p>"If she hasn’t figured out that we know what she’s done yet, she will. Until I can figure out the best course of action, just wait, and watch out for each other. Eventually, we will need to find out what she knows, but I will exhaust my avenues with the Council first."</P>
<p>"What will the Council do to her?"</P>
<p>"I’m not sure what they will decide. It is a rarity for a slayer to go rouge. My main concern is for Buffy’s safety. If you are her target…"</P>
<p>"I know." Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, Faith regained consciousness just in time to hear her phone ring. Groggily, she made it up to her bed, and picked up her phone.</P>
<p>"Boss. Hi…Ooh." She grabbed her head. "It’s nothing. I just got a little knocked out…no I’m fine…it’s possible. She doesn’t strike me as the ‘slug somebody in the face for no reason’ type…she could just think I’m a bitch right now, but I think she’s known that for awhile…well if she does know…her join the bad side? I really don’t see it happening… but…yeah, I’ll deal."</P>
<p>She hung up, and went to get ice for her head.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow sat on Buffy’s couch snuggled up against her.</P>
<p>"This week seemed like forever." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"I’m really sorry."</P>
<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for. You were trying to protect me, and I can’t believe you went through what you did, just to protect me. But I know now, and we’ll all deal with Faith. I won’t let her hurt you anymore."</P>
<p>"Or kiss me."</P>
<p>"That will not be happening again."</P>
<p>"Good. But right now, I want to kiss you."</P>
<p>"Please do."</P>
<p>Willow did, and both their hearts started to beat again. Then the warmth came back. She kept planting small kisses on Buffy’s face. All over.</P>
<p>"My parents are out of town."</P>
<p>Kiss.</P>
<p>"Really?"</P>
<p>Kiss.</P>
<p>"It’s lonely at home."</P>
<p>Kiss.</P>
<p>"Stay here."</P>
<p>Willow smiled, and then kissed her again.</P>
<p>"I was hoping you’d say that."</P>
<p>"I think it’s time for me to join in."</P>
<p>Buffy switched places with her, and now she was delivering the kisses.</P>
<p>"Let’s never…" Willow said.</P>
<p>Kiss.</P>
<p>"Ever…"</P>
<p>Kiss.</P>
<p>"Stay away from each other for a week…"</P>
<p>Kiss.</P>
<p>"Again…"</P>
<p>As Buffy’s kisses started to travel off Willow’s face, the front door opened, and Joyce came in carrying groceries. They pulled away quickly.</P>
<p>"Hey you two. I’m making a late dinner, if you’re interested."</P>
<p>"Thanks, mom." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Joyce went into the kitchen, and they got up.</P>
<p>"Damn." They both said, trying to hide their grins as they walked into the kitchen.</P>
