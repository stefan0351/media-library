<!-- Mixed Messages \ Chapter 9: And the mighty wrath of Brooke descended upon her... -->

<p>Nicole hurried to the newspaper office, fearing the worst. And boy,
did she get it.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke gasped, "we need to find a safer place to do this."</p>

<p>Sam was too busy sucking on Brooke's nipple to reply. Brooke gave up
the fight and let her head loll back, letting the sensations wash
over her, when there was a timid rap at the door. Both froze. </p>

<p>"If we don't move, they'll think no one's here," Sam hissed. Brooke
nodded, frantically trying to get her top done up. The rap sounded
again, followed by Nicole's voice. "Brookie? Mary Cherry saw you go
in there, and I need to talk to you alone, so I thought I'd follow
you in."</p>

<p>Sam looked around for a hiding place just as the door handle started
to turn, spotted the desk and dived under with only a split second to
spare. Nicole walked into the office, and spying Brooke, went to
stand in front of her. She'd heard all manner of strange noises, some
of which she recognized as Brooke's pleasure, some of which she
reasoned must be Spam. But now was not the time to focus on that. </p>

<p>"Brookie, tell me the truth. Why have you been so down lately?"</p>

<p>Brooke gaped at her, then rearranged her face into what she hoped was
depression. "Just the usual," she said, eyes downcast. "Unrequited
love, feeling fat, and just family shit."</p>

<p>Nicole's eyes narrowed. "You're twig thin, your family shouldn't
bother you because the McPhersons are NOT a part of it, and as for
unrequited love, Brookie, you can have any guy in this school. In
this state, for God's state. So what's the problem?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I don't want any GUY in this school," Brooke muttered under
her breath. Nicole pretended not to hear. </p>

<p>"Okay, here's what I'm going to say to you. I know who you've been
pining away for, and I've got witnesses who can place you with said
person, doing things I'm sure you don't want spread over school, so
perhaps it's time you actually told me the truth."</p>

<p>Brooke suddenly couldn't remember what had possessed her to keep
Nicole Julian as her best friend for so long. Sam was a better friend
than Nicole would ever be, and not that she'd kissed Nicole, but she
imagined Sam was a better kisser, too. "I don't have to justify
myself to you!" Brooke spat. "I don't know what you think you know,
but if it's the truth, I'm certainly not going to deny it!"</p>

<p>"So you won't deny that you're in love with your soon-to-be-
stepsister, Spammie the luncheon meat McPherson."</p>

<p>Sam, listening hard under the table, found herself holding her
breath, waiting for Brooke's response. </p>

<p>"No, I'm not going to deny that. I love Samantha McPherson, do you
have a problem with that? And she loves me, and we are an item, and
her name is SAM, not Spam. So stop calling her Spam!" Brooke was
right in Nicole's face now, her every word bit off clearly and
angrily. Sam burst into tears. Brooke wasn't afraid of telling
Nicole? Well, then, neither was she. She slowly crawled out from
under the table, but stopped when she heard Nicole's next words. </p>

<p>"Brookie, why? Why her, when you could have had..." she trailed off.
Sam decided to stay where she was. Something was about to be spilled. </p>

<p>"Could have had who, Nicole? Which poor dumb guy were you planning to
set me up with? After Josh, which guy could you possibly deem worthy
of your presence, let alone mine? Well here's a newsflash, Nicole. I.
AM. GAY. And nothing you try to do is going to turn me away from Sam,
because I really do love her. So what? What were you going to say,
Nicole?" </p>

<p>Brooke's voice had turned threatening, and Nicole wasn't sure she
wanted to continue this conversation now. Hell, even Sam, under the
table, was glad it wasn't her who had to face the wrath of Brooke.
But the barn door was open, and the horse had well and truly bolted,
so Nicole mustered her strength and blurted it out. </p>

<p>"You could have had me," she blurted, starting to cry. "You could
have had me, and you didn't even notice that all this time we
were  friends, I've had a gigantic crush on you, did you? No, you
were too busy pining away for everyone and anyone else! All those
popstars, all guys, and then Josh, conveniently the star of the
football team, also conveniently male, and now Sam, who is the first
female crush you've had. But why her, Brooke? Why... not... me?"</p>

<p>Nicole was sobbing now, her shoulders heaving with the effort to
control herself. She slid to her knees, her hands over her face and
gulped and sniffled as she finally succeeded in gaining control. Then
she looked up, because Brooke was speaking.</p>

<p>"You're gay?" she asked, incredulously. Of all the things Nicole
could have said, this was the last thing she had expected. And she
wasn't sure if she was at all happy about this new development. </p>

<p>"Yes, I'm gay, and I'm in love with you," Nicole spat, having
progressed past despair to anger. Anger, she did well. "What are you
going to say, Brooke? You pity me now? Well? What are you going to
say?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to say... I don't know. What do you say to something like
that?"</p>

<p>"Well, ideally, you say you love me too, but I guess that's not going
to happen, so I guess all we're left with is finding out who is
better, Brooke. Who is better out of Sam and me?"</p>

<p>Brooke started to back away. "No, Nicole, I'm not doing this. I love
Sam, and I don't want to cheat on her. I'm not going to kiss you."</p>

<p>Hot tears sprang to Nicole's eyes, but she choked them back, and was
about to retort when out of the corner of her eye she saw Sam crawl
out from under the desk. "What the fuck?" she gasped. "Spam's been
here the whole time? Probably recording everything, so she could do a
fucking exposé in the newspaper on Monday."</p>

<p>"No," Sam said. "I heard everything, but I'll never tell. And I have
to admit, I'm kind of curious. I want you to kiss her, Brooke. So you
can never say to me, I wonder what would have happened if I'd kissed
her. You'll know. Just do it."</p>

<p>There wasn't a trace of sadness or fear in Sam's voice, just genuine
curiosity. Brooke nodded, and this time when Nicole approached her,
she didn't back away. "Just once," Brooke clarified. "And when it's
over, I'm still going to be with Sam. Nothing will change that."</p>

<p>"Okay," Nicole agreed. When their lips touched, Sam was watching them
carefully. Nicole's eyes closed instantly, and she leaned into
Brooke, savoring the moment. Brooke's eyes stayed open, and they
seemed to be sending a message to Sam. &lt;I wish this was you,&gt; they
said. &lt;Only you.&gt;</p>

<p>The blondes broke apart a second later, and looked at each other.
Nicole, for once, was speechless, but Brooke had plenty to say. </p>

<p>"Okay. We kissed. It was okay, but I still love Sam. I don't want to
upset you or anything, but I think she's a better kisser than you.
That could be because I love her, but oh well. And now, since you
made Sam watch that, and I don't care how okay she says she is with
it, it must have hurt her just a little, since you made her watch it,
I think it's only fair you see us kiss, so there's no mistakes. So
you'll know how much we love each other, and you won't try any of
your schemes to break us up."</p>

<p>She walked over and put her arms around Sam's waist, and felt Sam's
arms snake around her neck. As soon as their lips touched, everything
around them dropped away, leaving only the two of them in the room.
Nicole watched enviously, but when Brooke's hand came up to cup Sam's
breast and tweak her nipple, Nicole left. The last thing she heard
was Sam's rapturous groan. </p>

<p>"...I know there's nothing worse/than unrequited love" The Corrs,
Love to Love You</p>

<p>And as Nicole walked down the hall to her next class, the one Mary
Cherry had got her out of, the one she was hideously late for, she
cried, just a little, for the happiness that would never be hers. </p>

<p>"I guess the better woman won, Spammie. You better treat my Brookie
right."</p>
