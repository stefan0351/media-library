<p>A/N: Lets get right to the good stuff, shall we?</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>After Olivia had exited the gym in a walk of shame and sat on the bleachers, looking for all she was worth a sullen teen with drama problems, Eunice happened to run by on the track and spotted the blond.</p>
<p>"You look so down its insane." Eunice blurted out before she ran by. Olivia stared blankly after her running frame before an amused smirk appeared on her face. For some reason a dose of Eunice's blunt observations was what she needed to snap out of her funk. She started to reorganize her thoughts instead of focusing on her utter deficiency when it came to expressing her feelings to one person.</p>
<p>"Maybe I'm just making it more complicated than it should be." she realized. She had been so busy tip-toeing around Viola feelings and groping for any sort of hope for herself that she didn't think of the most obvious course of action she should have taken. "I should just confess and get it over with." With that statement out there, Olivia resolved to tell Viola her feelings the next time she saw her. She was going to be strong about it and whatever the outcome, Olivia would just be glad to get all the pent up feelings out there.</p>
<p><i>'So why the hell am I shaking so much?</i>' Olivia thought to herself in frustration as she stared at Viola a few tables ahead of her, who was busy tearing into a piece of meat like a starving animal.</p>
<p>It was the next day where they both had to attend a debutante meeting in which the group would be seated at fancy tables and served their meals on fancy dinner plates and eat with fancy silverware. The purpose of the meeting was to learn how to make ladylike entrances. It was ironic since Viola had arrived late with the loudest most rude entrance possible. But it didn't stop Olivia's heart to almost stop beating in awe at how beautiful Viola looked in her white Versace dress and in nervousness at what she was planning to do, even as Viola wrestled with her purse and muttered "Son of a..!" in a very unlady-like way.</p>
<p>Now she felt Viola's gaze on her from across the room, fraying her nerves even more. The cracker she was holding in her hand was crushed by a tightened fist. "Damn it!" Olivia muttered to herself, wiping the crumbs from her dress. A few quiet gasps sounded around her table and she suddenly remebered where she was. "Sorry, ladies." She apologized sheepishly. "Will you excuse me?" she got up to head for the restroom, catching Viola's eye as she walked. She was so nervous her knees nearly buckled but she managed to make it to the restroom.</p>
<p>"Remember Viola, chew like you have a secret." The president of the Stratford Junior League whispered to the brunette. Viola ignored her and kept taking huge bites out of the large drumstick she had in her hand. She watched intently as Olivia got up from her table and made her way to the bathroom. That was her cue.</p>
<p>"Ladies." she excused herself , mouth still full of meat as she said it.</p>
<p><i>'I am was ready for some settlin', yo!'</i> Viola paused at that thought. <i>'Maybe I've been spending way to much time as a guy</i>?' she shrugged. "I'm going in."</p>
<p>Both girls stood side by side, staring at their respective reflections in the wide mirror. Olivia looked like she was going to DIE from the silence. Viola looked unbalanced, both itching to get the interaction going and hesitant to be the first one to speak, seeing as the situation felt more awkward than she had anticipated. Their eyes met in the mirror briefly before quickly glancing away.</p>
<p>Viola suddenly clenched her fists as she decided to take the initiative, giving a firm nod to herself in the mirror. Olivia suspected that she had given herself a mental pep-talk and was nearly amused if she wasn't so friggin' out of her mind with anxiety.</p>
<p>"Hey Olivia."</p>
<p>"Hey, Viola."</p>
<p>Awkward pause.</p>
<p>"So, I don't mean to pry, but, you asked Duke out on a date?" Viola started off casually, fixing her hair a bit in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Olivia stated sheepishly.</p>
<p>"You know, I'm the one that suggested the idea, but now, speaking as an unaffiliated third party with no personal interest in the matter, I'm not sure that you and Duke would be a good pairing after all." Viola stated firmly. Olivia smiled slightly at that. Viola trying to act indifferent on the matter was cute beyond belief to her.</p>
<p>"Actually..." Olivia sighed, glancing to the side as a faint blush tainted her cheeks. "I don't really like Duke." she said. She took a deep breath as if steeling herself to continue. "You see, I... have this huge thing for his roommate." Olivia said in a flustered voice, blushing uncontrollably now. She glanced at Viola for a reaction. Viola stared blankly at her.</p>
<p>"But I'm his roommate..?" Viola said in confusion. Olivia wanted to face-palm but reined herself in from the reflex. She nodded slowly, willing for Viola to catch so she wouldn't have to say it herself. Viola gasped suddenly in surprise. "You don't mean..?" she pointed to herself in bewilderment.</p>
<p>Olivia sighed. "Is it really such a surprise?" her voice held a sarcastic edge behind the embarrassment.</p>
<p>"So... when we fake broke-up, I really hurt your feelings, didn't I?"</p>
<p>Olivia's averting of her eyes answered her question.</p>
<p>"And at the carnival when you kissed me it wasn't really for charity?"</p>
<p>Olivia nodded.</p>
<p>"And when you asked Duke out it was just to make me jealous?" Viola appeared to be able to connect the dots when the picture was finally clear to her. Olivia nodded once more, her blush becoming more prominent as Viola added two and two together and got four. "Oh boy." Viola sighed, trying to absorb the information in. This was certainly unexpected!</p>
<p>Olivia now fully turned her frame to face the other girl, passion burning in her eyes. "I know its really wrong to use a person that way, and I feel really terrible about it, but I really really like you!" Olivia said in earnest. Viola appeared stunned and blushed at Olivia's confession.</p>
<p>"Olivia... I never..." Viola tried to say but Olivia pushed forward, determined to get everything off her shoulders or she would never get another opportunity.</p>
<p>"You're just so beautiful. And not just the generic type of beautiful that you see in most girls but more of a delicate, refined beautiful." It was Viola's turn to appear flushed as Olivia stepped closer to her, looking up into her eyes. "And when you smile," Olivia raised her hand to gently place it on the other girl's cheek. "I just can't stop looking at you." she lightly stroked Viola's bottom lip, not being able to help herself when Viola sheepishly smiled down at her. "And even though you're utterly clueless and insufferable, and make me want to just grab you and shake you, and just an overall pain,"</p>
<p>"Hey, that's quite the laundry list of insults you got there." Viola muttered with a frown. It had started off good and now she was getting told off!</p>
<p>"You're just so wonderful." Olivia got to her point with a smirk. She licked her lips and leaned closer to Viola's tempting mouth, making the brunette look nervous as hell. "Sometimes I just want to kiss you so passionately that even the people you hate will feel pleasure." she whispered, making a shiver go up Viola's spine. But she was unable to move or look away from those eyes, and just like at the carnival, Olivia's eyes ensnared her.</p>
<p>The spell was suddenly broken when the door to one of the bathroom stalls swung open and they jumped apart.</p>
<p>"Monique." Olivia greeted coldly, her body language suddenly stiff as if expecting the strawberry blond to take violent action at any moment.</p>
<p>"Olivia." she greeted back smartly. Viola was still trying to recover from the moment.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" Olivia asked coolly.</p>
<p>Monique chuckled. "I couldn't help but overhear your little confession there. Real corny, by the way." she said mockingly, making Olivia scowl angrily. It was not <i>that</i> corny! "And I just wanted to congratulate you two!" The surprise was apparent on their faces. "I only thought you were after my boyfriend Sebastian, but you're not, so I can finally live happily ever after with him!"</p>
<p>"Ex-boyfriend." Viola said pointedly. The last thing she needed was this girl on her back as well!</p>
<p>"Okay, people have got to stop saying that!" Monique suddenly got defensive. "We did not break-up, kay? We're just going through a bit of a rough patch!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, whatever you say." Olivia said sarcastically. Monique visibly held herself back from starting another fight with the other blond.</p>
<p>"Whatever. Like you two would know." she started to walk away. "Have a nice life, you lovebirds, you." She laughed evily as she exited the restroom.</p>
<p>"I hope she chokes on a croissant." Olivia muttered in an annoyed fashion. That girl seriously had the worst timing in the history of bad timings! Viola blushed from the lovebirds comment. After a few moments of awkward silence, the atmosphere having been ruined, Olivia cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"Look, Viola... You don't have to give me an answer now. I just wanted you to know that there is someone out there who truly has feelings for you and who would give their everything to be with you. Just wake up! I've been waiting for you." Olivia glanced at Viola, who was staring at her reflection uncertainly. "I really mean that." Olivia said soflty before she slowly walked away from from the scene of the confession. Her only hope was that her feelings would finally be acknowledged after being suppressed for so long.</p>
<p>The air in the debutant restroom was extremely still as Viola was left alone. She stared at herself for quite a long time before she shook her head in bewilderment. "HOLY CRAP!" She was heard by everyone in the next room, unbeknownst to her, making Olivia want to face-palm again at the exclamation.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>A/N: OMG, I just found out that I'm gonna be an aunt! (passes out)</p>
