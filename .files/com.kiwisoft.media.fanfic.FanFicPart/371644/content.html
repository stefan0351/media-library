<p>"Urgh, I hate this lesson," Miley whined, sitting in one of the neatly placed chairs infront of the stage.</p>
<p>"Don't put such a downer on it," Lilly laughed, placing herself next to Miley, "It can be fun."</p>
<p>Miley turned and stared at her, a don't-lie-to-me kinda' stare.</p>
<p>"C'mon Miles, no one else complains," Oliver offered, him too taking one of the chairs next to the girls.</p>
<p>"Yeah, because this is where most people get together for the paper football championships," she pointed out, looking over at a group of people who were playing the game, and taking it rather seriously.</p>
<p>"Paper football? <i>Awesome!</i>" Oliver exclaimed, running over to join the crowd.</p>
<p>Miley and Lilly watched him leave, confusion on their faces. "He worries me more very day."</p>
<p>Lilly just laughed, giving up on any response at the sight of Mr Corelli entering the room. "Class, I want you in groups of two," he stated simply.</p>
<p>Lilly and Miley turned to eachother immediately with a smile. There was no question about it. If they were in pairs, it was Miley and Lilly. Yes, Oliver would be in their trio, but when it was pairs it was Miley/Lilly and Oliver/Sarah...everyone knew that.</p>
<p>"Boy girl pairs please," Mr Corelli mentioned looking at the two, as the rest of the class took to their seats, the paper football championship finals put on hold.</p>
<p>"Sir, you know we always go together," Lilly whined.</p>
<p>"Yes...but I just think it would be bes-"</p>
<p>"If we stayed together, because we work well. Right?" Miley attempted, batting her eyelashes.</p>
<p>"Well, yes, you do. But I just think-"</p>
<p>"Then don't," Lilly smiled.</p>
<p>He shrugged, "Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you."</p>
<p>Miley and Lilly sent one last smile his way, then one more to eachother, before Mr Corelli finally began addressing the whole class. "Okay, class. Today we'll be focusing on<i> romantic scenes</i>," he stated, turning to Lilly and Miley with his eyebrows raised for the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>As well as some other members of the class, Lilly and Miley had disgusted looks on their faces.</p>
<p>"But you can't-"</p>
<p>"I told you," he answered, smugly.</p>
<p>"But I...and she...and we..." Lilly tried, pointing at said people at the right times, still looking slightly confused and disgusted.</p>
<p>"Don't have a problem with that," he finished for her, "Unless one of you would like to go with Dandruff Danny?"</p>
<p>There was always one person left out in the class, and it was more than likely Dandruff Danny. Most of the time the teacher would work with him instead, but obviously, today that wasn't going to happen.</p>
<p>"I'm not going with him," Lilly mumbled, trying not to be too loud.</p>
<p>"Me neither. I mean, what if I eat flakes?" Both girl's cringed and shuddered at the thought. "We should just go together, I mean, we won't have to kiss or anything."</p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong," Mr Corelli casually butted in again, "You know me, you can't learn without tackling the subject head on."</p>
<p>"Not even just this one time?" Miley tried, giving him a large and fake smile.</p>
<p>He smiled back, before finally dead panning and releasing his expression, "No."</p>
<p>He began walking to the front of the class again, "If anyone's uncomfortable, tough. You're not in third grade anymore, I'm sure you're all mature enough." He looked at the guys at the back, getting slightly excited and high-fiving each other, Oliver being one of them. "Okay...<i>some</i> of you."</p>
<p>"Okay," Miley finally said, turning to Lilly, "We just do it and it's never mentioned again."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, "Okay."</p>
<p>"You need to be able to feel comfortable in these situations, no matter who your partner is, you have to create a connection," he said, standing again at the front of the class. "I want you to turn to your partner, look eachother dead in the eye."</p>
<p>Finally looking away from Mr Corelli, and the guys at the back finally ceasing their high-fives, everyone turned to their partner. Lilly and Miley did the same, both looking a bit anxious about what was to come.</p>
<p>The teacher began moving around the room, swaying as if to get into the mood, "Stare into the other person's eyes, feel their emotion, share your emotions."</p>
<p>Lilly looked at Miley's eyes, the brunette doing the exact same back. They both felt strange, nervous. They'd never been in a situation like this, and neither of them knew what to think.</p>
<p>"Finally, let their eyes pull you in. Let yourself forget about everything else, it's just you and that person..."</p>
<p>Miley slowly edged forward, still looking into Lilly's eyes seriously. Lilly watched Miley's movement, not moving back but staying completely still. She looked down, noticing Miley's lips pursing slightly, and her eyes slowly closing. Lilly did the same, and finally began making her own, slow move forwards.</p>
<p>Their lips touched lightly, neither girl making a move. After a few seconds of non-movement, Lilly moved her boy forward a little more, and in one swift movement she deepened the kiss. Miley responded in kind, raising one of her hands and placing it onto Lilly's cheek.</p>
<p>They continued like this. Nothing else could be heard. Nothing else could be seen. Nothing else could be felt. Just the amazing rush that both girl's could feel run through their body's, the feeling of never wanting it to end taking over them.</p>
<p>Finally, realising where they were, Lilly pulled away quickly.</p>
<p>Miley instantly opened her eyes when the feel of Lilly's lips on hers was eliminated. She was breathing heavily, still looking into her eyes.</p>
<p>She looked to the side a little, to see a shocked boy and girl sat opposite eachother and staring over at Miley and Lilly.</p>
<p>She moved her vision to the right a little more and noticed the whole class, even Mr Corelli staring at them, shocked.</p>
<p>"I knew there was something goin' on," she heard Amber mumble as she leaned over to speak with Ashley.</p>
<p>Miley looked back to Lilly, who had also noticed the stares and still had a certain amount of shock on her face. It wasn't supposed to be that long. They weren't supposed to continue...but they did.</p>
<p>"<i>Okay,</i>" Mr Corelli finally tried, making his way back to the front of the class, "Well done class. Let's move on."</p>
<p>Finally, people's vision moved away from the two, yet the shocked faces remained.</p>
<p>Miley turned on her seat, facing the front again, and Lilly did the same moments later.</p>
<p>The brunette snook one last glance at Lilly just as she had done the same, their eyes meeting for a brief second before Miley looked down at the floor, unwilling to get lost in those eyes again.</p>
<p>...what had just happened?</p>
<p><b>A/N: I left it without an ending, but I didn't think there was a good one.<br>
Besides, it leaves it to the imagination :P<br>
I don't know where this came from, but i just really needed to write.<br>
One day there may be a sequel, but I dunno.<br>
Anyways, I hope you at least remotely enjoyed what came of my boredom :)<br>
