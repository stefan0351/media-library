<!-- Port Of Call \ Chapter 5 -->

<p>Kelsey took a deep breath and made her way through the crowded room or party goers and slid in between the revelers that surrounded the table Alyssa stood atop. <i>'Here goes nothing!'</i></p>
		<p>"Well roomie, I think you've had enough excitement for one night." The tall raven-haired woman reached a hand up to help Alyssa down off the table, but her arm was jerked around stopping her. Spinning around quickly, Kelsey faced a blonde-haired man and the look on her face gave him reason to think twice about what he was doing. </p>
		<p>"Hey, no harm mate. We was just having a spot of fun with the 'newbie'. He raised his hands in a mock surrender and backed off. Kelsey looked at the group around the table before resting her eyes on one of the women that she knew was behind this. "I think this 'newbie' has had enough. I don't want any trouble, I just came to collect my roommate."</p>
		<p>"Maybe she isn't ready to go, isn't that right love?" Karen reached up to hand Alyssa another drink and looked back at Kelsey challengingly. Kelsey shook her head slowly and looked up at the blonde to see if what Karen said could possibly be true. Alyssa's expression was one of confusion as she first looked toward Karen and then at Kelsey. The full affect of the alcohol was finally beginning to hit her. Kelsey watched as the confusion turn to fear and then something else that triggered a response in her. Kelsey quickly pushed the drink away from the blonde and reaching up again, she pulled Alyssa down off the table and over her shoulder firemen style. Turning, she roughly pushed her way through the crowd, her stride and demeanor dared anyone to stop her. Even carrying the weight this way, was a struggle for the strong woman, but she kept moving until the fresh air hit her in the face and she bean to hear Alyssa moaning. Quickly setting Alyssa on her feet, she followed the blonde as she ran for the rail, and almost climbing over it in her attempt to litter the high seas. Kelsey held on to Alyssa so that she wouldn't fall overboard and waited until the woman could on her own on the deck.</p>
		<p>"Feeling better?" Kelsey asked sarcastically, keeping her arm around the woman's waist to steady her.</p>
		<p>"Just peachy!" Alyssa responded snidely to Kelsey's tone of voice wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.</p>
		<p>"Good, because you are going to feel a lot worse come morning." Kelsey replied dryly and began leading the blonde back toward their cabin.</p>
		<p>Alyssa didn't feel like commenting on Kelsey's humor and stumbled along until they reached the cabin where she quickly threw herself down on her bed.</p>
		<p>"I wouldn't do....." Kelsey called out to the prone woman. Alyssa lay still for only a few moments before jumping up and running to the bathroom.</p>
		<p>"...that." Kelsey shook her head and began to get changed for bed. After about twenty minutes and no sign of Alyssa, she went into the bathroom to find the woman sitting on the floor sound asleep with her head resting against the vanity.</p>
		<p>Leaning down, she lightly shook Alyssa and grasped her by her arms in an effort to pull her to her feet. "Come on, time to get into bed."</p>
		<p>"No, this is good!" Alyssa slurred sleepily. "I like it here."</p>
		<p>"Come on...I promise you will like it better in bed." Kelsey replied and tugged the woman to stand and steadied her by grabbing on to her belt in back, and began directing Alyssa back toward the bedroom.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah...I will?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I promise." Kelsey replied as she fought to maneuver the tottering woman through the narrow bathroom door without sending both of them down onto the floor in a heap.</p>
		<p>"With you?" The garbled response caused Kelsey to stumble and almost drop the young woman. She stopped dead in her tracks and she looked down at Alyssa, whose eyes were still closed in a dreamy haze of alcohol induced sleep. Kelsey knew that if Alyssa actually knew what she was saying she would definitely be embarrassed. Thinking about it, a mischievous smile crossed her lips and she figured paybacks were in order.</p>
		<p>"Is that what you would like?"</p>
		<p>"Will you be nicer to me or mean like you have been?" Alyssa's voice was raspy and slurred, but her words cut through to Kelsey's heart. She hadn't really been very nice to the woman and it wasn't entirely Alyssa's fault. She didn't understand why she touched off this spark of anger either. </p>
		<p>"Yes, I will." Kelsey murmured without realizing she was actually speaking the words outloud.</p>
		<p>"Good...then oh yes, that's exactly what I want!" Alyssa's voice sang out loudly as she tried to propel herself forward toward the bed and only succeeded in stumbling and almost falling. Kelsey grabbed her and held her tightly against her as she tied to get Alyssa to the bed without dropping her. Kelsey was beginning to feel guilty about the conversation and decided to stop it right here. Finally, getting her positioned next to the bed, Kelsey let Alyssa fall backward onto the bed.</p>
		<p>"Well, why don't you get some sleep and ask me again tomorrow." Kelsey removed the woman's shoes and lifted her legs onto the bed.</p>
		<p>"Chicken!" Alyssa giggled and was sound asleep before Kelsey pull the covers over her.</p>
		<p>"You got that right!" Kelsey murmured and turned to get into her own bed. Sleep did not come as easily for Kelsey as she lay listening to the light snoring of her roommate. Finally, her mind was so exhausted from tormenting itself that she fell into asleep to the rhythm of Alyssa's heavy breathing.</p>
