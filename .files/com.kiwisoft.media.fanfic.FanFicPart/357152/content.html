<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 8: Sharing and Planning-->

<p>Sitting in Trigonometry across the aisle from Willow, Buffy drifted into her thoughts. She was glad Willow was back in her house and her relationship with her parents was getting better, but she missed waking up next to her.</P>
<p>She never thought that having someone there, sleeping next to you, was a big deal. Well, that was until she had experienced it. Even with all her strength and ability, when she was wrapped in Willow’s arms she felt completely safe and content. And then it was taken away.</P>
<p>It was hard to go back. </P>
<p>Looking up from her desk, she locked gazes with Willow. Buffy knew she felt the same way.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy and saw that she was thinking the same thing. They both needed to go do something fun. Something relaxing, by themselves. She got a piece of paper, and wrote something down. She passed it to Buffy.</P>
<p>&lt; Wanna go do something tonight? &gt;</P>
<p>Buffy passed the note back.</P>
<p>&lt; Just us? &gt;</P>
<p>Willow smiled down at the note.</P>
<p>&lt; Just us. And bowling. &gt;</P>
<p>Buffy looked up at her with a ‘you can’t be serious’ look.</P>
<p>< We’ll go to the ice cream shop afterwards. My treat. ></P>
<p>Before Buffy could respond, the bell rang, and they walked out of the classroom.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>As they were walking down the halls to the library, Willow noticed that nobody was looking at them. The whole thing had worn off, or at least nothing was said about them to her face anyway, and she was glad for it. She felt safe in school again.</P>
<p>"What’s wrong with bowling?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"It’s…bowling."</P>
<p>"Oh that’s a great reason."</P>
<p>"Knocking down ten objects that look like inflated socks, with a ball, just seems…well, stupid."</P>
<p>"You’re just saying that because you probably get strikeouts all the time cause of your slayerness, and it gets boring."</P>
<p>"Yeah…that’s…gotta be it." Buffy said slowly.</P>
<p>"You were gonna take me bowling a couple weeks ago."</P>
<p>"I wanted to cheer you up. I’d do anything to see you happy."</P>
<p>Willow smiled at her.</P>
<p>"Then go bowling with me, then we’ll get ice cream. It’ll make me happy." Willow gave her the ‘puppy dog’ look.</P>
<p>Buffy sighed.</P>
<p>"You’re just lucky I love you."</P>
<p>"Yeah, I am."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Why can’t we double?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>"Nothing against you and Cordy, Xand, but if we all went, I’m pretty sure I’d get a headache." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"And we’re both fresh out of aspirin." Willow said.</P>
<p>The library was silent as everyone realized that Willow had made a remark at Xander’s expense.</P>
<p>"It was a joke, people."</P>
<p>"And a good one for a first attempt, even though I so take offense at it." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"Are you saying you two won’t start fighting for no reason?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"And not stop till you find a closet?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>Silence again.</P>
<p>"My whole world is shaken. Two in a row." Xander said.</P>
<p>Buffy gave Willow a high five.</P>
<p>"I hate to put a stop to this amusing conversation," Giles said, "but have any of you heard from or seen Faith?"</P>
<p>A chorus of ‘nope’ was his answer.</P>
<p>"She hasn’t been slaying or anything. I think she just likes time to herself." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"That’s understandable, however, she is my responsibility, and I would be much happier knowing where she was and what she was doing."</P>
<p>"I volunteer to go get her." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Oh no you don’t." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>He shrunk back.</P>
<p>"Let her be for today. She needs to adjust in her own way." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Yes, I suppose you’re right."</P>
<p>"I am? Does anybody have a video camera so I can record this? It may never happen again."</P>
<p>"I think I saw one in the utility closet, Xander." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>Not picking up on her intentions for a moment, he finally understood.</P>
<p>"Yeah, I think I saw one too. Let’s go."</P>
<p>Cordelia and Xander practically sprinted out of the library, leaving Buffy, Willow, and Giles to stare after them in confused amazement.</P>
<p>"For the life of me, I cannot understand how their minds function with that level of hormonal activity."</P>
<p>They didn’t want to go down that road.</P>
<P>Willow walked over to Buffy.</P>
<p>"So…when do you wanna…"</P>
<p>"Seven?"</P>
<p>"Okay, cause I need to reserve a lane."</P>
<p>"Reserve a lane?"</P>
<p>"It’s a popular place."</P>
<p>Buffy couldn’t help but laugh.</P>
<P>"I’ll be by your house at six-thirty then."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy stood on the sidewalk in front of the walkway that led up to Willow’s house. Willow came out, and started walking over towards her.</P>
<p>"Bye, mom!" She called after her mother.</P>
<p>Buffy waved at Mrs. Rosenberg. Willow whispered to Buffy.</P>
<p>"I never thought I’d get out of there."</P>
<p>As soon as they got off Willow’s street, Buffy wrapped her arms around Willow’s waist from behind.</P>
<p>"I missed you."</P>
<p>"I know what you mean." Willow said leaning in closer. "I look over every morning and you’re not there anymore."</P>
<p>"I’m here now."</P>
<p>"Yes you are." Willow said kissing her.</P>
<p>They broke apart and started walking side by side. Buffy noticed that Willow had a bag flung over her shoulder. Buffy gave her a quizzical look.</P>
<p>"Bowling stuff."</P>
<p>"You really like bowling, huh?"</P>
<p>"Yep. And besides, it’s the most neutral thing I could think of to go out with you to, because I know my parents would go nuts if we were going to a restaurant or something really date-ish."</P>
<p>"Well, it doesn’t matter where we go. You’re here, I’m here. That’s all I care about."</P>
<p>"Good, because we’re gonna bowl till we drop."</P>
<p>Buffy squirmed.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They got to the alley, and Buffy was trying to pick out shoes.</P>
<p>"See? This is why I don’t like this. They never have shoes my size. Guess I can’t bowl."</P>
<p>"Nonsense. I always come prepared."</P>
<p>Willow took out two pairs of bowling shoes, and handed a pair to Buffy.</P>
<p>"You have your own shoes?"</P>
<p>"I used to have the same problem. I could never find the right size to fit my feet, so I bought my own. And I knew you might try to use the shoes as an excuse, so I brought an extra pair. Come on, let’s get our lane."</P>
<p>They went over to lane five, and sat down to put their shoes on. After Willow was finished, she pulled a bowling ball out of her bag.</P>
<p>"You own a ball, too?"</P>
<p>"Customized holes on the ball for my fingers. See my dad and I…we used to bowl together a lot. It was our bonding thing. He got me a ball, taught me how to play…it’s the only thing we ever related to."</P>
<p>"I know what you mean. When I used to ice skate as a kid, my dad would always take me to the rink on Sundays and skate with me. He bought me skates and everything. One time he even rented out the whole place for me.</P>
<p>"And even though my parents are divorced now, he still takes me to the ice show in LA every year for my birthday."</P>
<p>"It’s nice to have a common ground with parents. Especially dads, because when you’re a girl, it’s hard to find something to do together."</P>
<p>They were both silent for a few moments, thinking back. Then Willow spoke.</P>
<p>"You want to go first?"</P>
<p>"Nah. You go ahead." Buffy said sitting behind the scorecard table. </P>
<p>Willow picked up her ball, situated her fingers, and got a running start, releasing the ball. The ball traveled straight down the middle of the lane, crashing into the pins. They all fell.</P>
<p>"Strike!" Willow squealed happily.</P>
<p>Buffy went wide-eyed.</P>
<p>"Wow. So how many is that?"</P>
<p>"10 points. But you can just mark an X."</P>
<p>Willow got her ball out of the ball return, and repeated her first effort.</P>
<p>"Come on, Buffy. Your turn."</P>
<p>Buffy got up slowly, and walked down, and grabbed a ball. Getting a bad throw off, the ball went down the left side of the lane, and into the gutter.</P>
<p>"You don’t bowl that often. You just need to warm up." Willow said.</P>
<p>Buffy didn’t say a word, and just got the ball back. She threw it, and it went down the left side again, but this time, it caught one pin.</P>
<p>"There you go. You got one."</P>
<p>Buffy turned around, and saw that Willow was grinning.</P>
<p>"You’ve found out my horrible secret. I stink at bowling."</P>
<p>Willow couldn’t help but laugh. Buffy glared at her.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry. Here, let me help you."</P>
<p>Willow got the ball, and gave it to Buffy. She stood behind her, and reached under Buffy’s arms to grab the ball with her.</P>
<p>"You know, a girl could get the wrong impression from this." Buffy said. She couldn’t see Willow’s face, but she knew it was red.</P>
<p>"Buffy! That’s not nice. Now, do you want to learn or not?"</P>
<p>"Yes. Sorry."</P>
<p>"Okay then. Now when you put your fingers in the holes, don’t grip too tightly because you want to be able to snap the ball out of your hand quickly."</P>
<p>They both thought about that for a moment and then Willow continued.</P>
<p>"Try to take long strides when you’re getting ready to throw. It gives you more momentum. Then bring your arm, fully extended, back and then forward."</P>
<p>Willow gripped Buffy’s arm, and they started to practice the motion.</P>
<p>Stuttering slightly, Willow continued. "If it helps, just think of the ball as a stake, and the pins as vampires."</P>
<p>"I can do that."</P>
<p>Willow stepped back, and Buffy took a deep breath. Doing exactly as Willow told her, she threw the ball. Not the way it was meant to be, however. It went up in the air, and landed on top of the ten pins, knocking them down.</P>
<p>Buffy turned around, smiling happily. Willow looked frightened.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"I think I forgot to mention that you’re supposed to roll the ball. You almost put a hole in the floor."</P>
<p>"Oh. Whoops."</P>
<p>"But at least you got the pins down, that’s an improvement."</P>
<P>Over the next half-hour, Buffy got progressively better, but Willow still won. The finale score was Willow, 233, Buffy, 187. </P>
<p>"Let’s get something to eat from the snack bar."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They got sodas and cheese fries, and sat down to eat.</P>
<p>"That’s the one thing I love about bowling alleys. The food." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"But it’s all greasy. And fattening."</P>
<p>"It tastes good though. That’s the important thing. The nice thing about being a slayer is you don’t have to do much to keep weight off. I remember my mom used to hound me about watching what I ate."</P>
<p>"She did?"</P>
<p>"Yeah, she and my dad were always so busy that she made sure to nag me about something before she disappeared for the entire day. The really important stuff though, was crammed into the shortest amount of time possible. I had to learn to absorb pretty fast. Like, the talk about sex, and I mean everything, A to V, was said in one hour."</P>
<p>"A to V?"</P>
<p>"AIDS to Virginity. One right after the other. I think that’s why I was so popular in school. I knew everything there was to know before everyone else."</P>
<p>"Well at least your parents told you about that stuff. Being the religious family that we were, they said seven words to me. ‘Sex is a sin; don’t do it.’ I was very sheltered. The only way I found out about that stuff was if I was lucky enough to overhear some girls talking at lunch.</P>
<P>"That wasn’t the only stuff, either. Things I needed to know, things I would ask were just avoided. They said religion held all the answers and that’s all I needed. Well, it never did. Not about everyday stuff anyway. Until recently, they had still seen me as a five year old child who wasn’t ever going to grow up in their eyes, so that meant they had nothing to worry about."</P>
<p>Buffy put her hand on top of Willow’s.</P>
<p>"Despite what you may think, my life wasn’t a walk in the park either, and that was before slaying. As soon as my mom lost her job, that’s when the fights started. My dad was the sole support, and he blamed everything on my mom. He also wasn’t around that much. His job had him working late hours and mom was left at home, trying to deal with all the bills, and me. </P>
<P>"The ‘friends’ I had were so dense, that I couldn’t talk to them about it. The only problems they heard were ones involving split ends, and bad mascara.</P>
<p>"It got worse when I started slaying. My dad didn’t just blame my mom anymore; he blamed me too because I was getting in trouble at school. And my mom defended me all the time, and I think that I was the last straw. When my mom announced we were moving after the divorce, well, sometimes I think he was glad to get rid of me."</P>
<p>"Don’t say that. You know he loves you. You didn’t cause anything between your parents."</P>
<p>"Didn’t I?"</P>
<p>"No. Trust me on that. It seems that we all had not so perfect childhoods. You’re not the only one."</P>
<p>"I know, but it feels like that to me sometimes."</P>
<p>"To me too. I went sixteen years without a real female friend. They would come to me for homework help and stuff, but as soon as they were finished with me, I was ignored. Xander was the only real friend I had, and he was great, but he was a guy. There were just things I couldn’t talk about with him. </P>
<P>"Besides as time went on, he became too distracted by other girls to really help me. I needed a friend of my own gender. I know it’s not as traumatic as having to slay while your parents are fighting every night, but…"</P>
<p>"Sure it is. From your perspective it was. Cause you lived through it."</P>
<p>"But now I have you. And I can say all those years were worthwhile because they got me here."</P>
<p>"Same here. You were my first ‘real’ female friend too. All those ditzes back at Hemry weren’t friends. They were sheep who followed me around cause I had the newest style on. You saw me deeper than that. Well, I wasn’t like that when I came to Sunnydale, but you know what I mean. You actually listened to what I had to say."</P>
<p>Willow smiled at her.</P>
<p>"Thanks for being my friend, and…for being more."</P>
<p>"Thanks for taking a chance on a nerd like me, and being my friend despite what every one else thought, and for being more…despite what everyone else thinks."</P>
<p>"I love you, Will."</P>
<p>"I love you too. So much."</P>
<p>They hugged tightly. After a few moments they stood up.</P>
<p>"Who’s in the mood for ice cream?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Me!"</P>
<p>"You wanna get outta here?"</P>
<p>"Uh huh, and the next time we come here, I’ll kick your butt."</P>
<p>"We’ll see. This is my turf, Slayer."</P>
<p>They threw away their trash, Willow gathered her stuff, and they were laughing all the way out the door.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They sat in the ice cream shop eating vanilla ice cream sundaes with hot fudge, whipped cream, nuts, and jimmies. </P>
<p>"This place has the best ice cream." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Yeah, this is great. I didn’t think anything could top DQ, but wow."</P>
<p>"Next time you have to try their banana split."</P>
<p>"Will, I’ve been thinking about something lately. Well, ever since you ‘moved out’, actually."</P>
<p>"What about?"</P>
<p>"After graduation would you want to get a place?"</P>
<p>"Together?"</P>
<p>"Yeah."</P>
<p>"That’s a big step…"</P>
<p>"I know, and I know it’s still early. I mean, who knows what’ll happen between now and then? You probably won’t even stay in Sunnydale."</P>
<p>"Yes I will."</P>
<p>"You don’t know for –"</P>
<p>"I will. I know things will probably come up, but I am promising you now, no matter what happens to our friendship or relationship, I ain’t leaving Sunnydale."</P>
<p>"Willow! Your grammar slipped!" Buffy said in fake shock.</P>
<p>"I like to rebel every once and awhile. I won’t lose you just because of some hang ups along the way. We’ll both go to UC Sunnydale, and if we get to the point where we want to get a place together, and I really hope that we do, we’ll do it."</P>
<p>"Simple as that, huh?"</P>
<p>"Simple as that. We’ve just set a goal, Buffy. As long as we stick to it, nothing else matters."</P>
<p>"So let’s make it official."</P>
<p>"Official?"</P>
<p>Buffy leaned in to kiss her.</P>
<p>"But what about…oh right. Screw them."</P>
<p>Willow leaned in as well, and their lips met. The goal was set in stone. Finishing their sundaes, they got up and left. A few tables behind where they had been sitting, Faith looked up, and watched them go.</P>
<p>"We’ll see how well they stick to that goal. Every relationship needs to be tested."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They ended up on a bench in the park, arms around one another. They both looked at their watches.</P>
<p>"I don’t wanna go." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Me either."</P>
<p>"Well you don’t have to, but my parents will send out a search party."</P>
<p>"Nah, they’ll give you some more time."</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<p>"Cause tomorrow’s Saturday."</P>
<p>Willow smiled into Buffy’s neck.</P>
<p>"That makes me happy."</P>
<p>"I thought it would."</P>
<p>"So what’d you wanna do this weekend?"</P>
<p>"You’re gonna hit me, but since we told Xander we were going solo tonight, I promised him we’d do miniature golf with him and Cordelia tomorrow."</P>
<p>Willow groaned.</P>
<p>"Sorry."</P>
<p>"No, it’s okay. Just a warning - let him win."</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<p>"He gets cranky if he doesn’t."</P>
<p>"Does Cordelia know that?"</P>
<p>They both looked at one another and gasped.</P>
<p>"Oh no." They said at the same time.</P>
<p>"I suddenly don’t feel so good." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"What’s going around?"</P>
<p>"The Plague?"</P>
<p>"Something realistic."</P>
<p>"You’re the brains. You come up with something."</P>
<p>They got up off the bench as Willow tried to think, and started to walk home.</P>
<p>"Syphilis?"</P>
<p>"Oh and that’s more realistic how?"</P>
<p>"We could just say we’re too tired."</P>
<p>Willow kissed her.</P>
<p>"That would give him ideas."</P>
<p>Buffy kissed back.</P>
<P>"Yeah we shouldn’t do that to him."</P>
<p>Willow kissed her again, longer this time, and for a few minutes they were lost in the sensation. When they pulled away, Buffy looked at Willow.</P>
<P>"I’d sure like to see the look on his face though."</P>
<p>They were quiet, picturing it, and they both started to laugh. It was good to be happy, and even though they knew it would be a rarity for a night to ever be this perfect again, they were content to just live in the moment.</P>
