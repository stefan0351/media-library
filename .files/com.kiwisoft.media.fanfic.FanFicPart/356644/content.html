<!-- If Destiny Wills \ Chapter 14 -->

<p>In order to explain the motives for his predecessors interference in the
affairs of an ancient sect long extinct and until recently unknown to
anyone outside the Church, the Abbot felt he must explain the sacred
duties of his office and the dedication of the men that held it through
the centuries. </p>

<p>"At the time we are chosen for this office we spent many hours studying
the rituals until we are able to recite them from memory perfectly. Only
then are we allowed to take our position as Abbot. </p>

<p>Every Abbot has dreamed that he would be the one to perform this ritual
and I am fortunate enough to be chosen by destiny to be the one that
performs the first of your joining rituals, a sort of betrothal
ceremony. </p>

<p>I think you will be surprised at the benefits you will receive as you
complete each stage of your joining." </p>

<p>Willow studied the man's face, concentrating on his dark brown eyes, and
could find no hint of deception. She was still leery of the intentions
of the Church, but her ability to read people had been greatly enhanced
by her powers, and if there was some ulterior motive behind this gesture
the man standing in front of her had no part of it. </p>

<p>"I have one question before I can agree to this unknown ritual." Willow
said, the contempt and sarcasm now gone from her voice. "It is a matter
of honesty and trust between us and it goes no farther than this room.
Do you agree?" </p>

<p>Seeing her sincerity and genuine willingness to cooperate the Abbot
answered her. "As long as it pertains only to me personally I see no
problems with your request, Sorceress. Ask your question." </p>

<p>"I understand that while you're here, you are a simple Abbot in charge
of a highly unorthodox order of brothers, but still only an Abbot. That
isn't exactly a powerful enough office to carry out all the things you
have promised us." Willow said watching the old man's face intently
looking for any sign of deceit. "So my question my dear priest is, when
you aren't running all over the world on the order's business, just what
is your office within the Church. Or as an old friend of mine used to
say, what's your day job?" </p>

<p>The Abbot thought for a moment then realizing the witch probably already
knew the answer, or at least had an idea, he chose to tell them the
truth. </p>

<p>"Good question my dear and fair considering the nature of our
relationship." the Abbot said looking Willow straight in the eye. "When
I am not on business for the order, I am a Cardinal and personal
assistant to the Holy Father.
So as you can see, I am well placed to keep any promises I have made.
Does that answer your question satisfactorily, Sorceress?" </p>

<p>Willow looked up at him for a few seconds then smiled a triumphant grin,
knowing the Abbot had just stepped over the line and had trusted them to
keep his secret. It was enough for her. </p>

<p>"When do we do this ritual and what do we need to perform it?" the now
satisfied witch asked brightly. </p>

<p>The others in the room gave a sigh of relief as it became clear that
Willow believed the Abbot and was going to trust him as much as her own
natural suspicions of the Church would allow. </p>

<p>"What we need is already here." the Abbot began. "This is like a kind of
betrothal ceremony. The two of you announce in front of two official
witnesses your feelings and intentions toward each other, while
exchanging the amulets.
I will officiate and Giles is the second witness. I chose him not for
his position as Watcher but because of his close personal relationship
with the two of you. As for when, I believe there is no time like the
present. It is an informal ritual and it needs to be done before we face
whatever we must face tonight." </p>

<p>Buffy and Willow locked eyes and searched for any doubt, seeing none
they leaned forward and kissed lightly. They turned to the Abbot who was
smiling down at them his eyes alight with hope and compassion for the
two girls.
They nodded their consent to begin. </p>

<p>"So it begins." the Abbot said with quiet reverence. "Willow now that
you have found the mate of your soul, and have agreed to join with her,
place your amulet around your beloved's neck and tell her what is in
your heart." </p>

<p>With trembling hands she carefully put the chain around the Slayer's
slender neck, and with some initial nervous fumbling she eventually
closed the intricate clasp, which faded away leaving a permanent
joining. </p>

<p>"Buffy, my love, what can I say?" Willow began, her trembling voice so
soft only Buffy and the Abbot could hear. "I've loved you since the day
I met you.
You have become my life, my world, my universe.
All that I am, all I do, and all I'll ever be is because of you. Without
you I'm nothing, I would not exist.
I need you, I want you, but more than anything else I love you and with
your consent I will spent my life trying to make you as happy as you
make me by just looking at me.
Please let me be at your side to face with you all that life has to
offer for good or bad.
I'll always be there for you and as long as we have each other, there is
nothing that can defeat us." </p>

<p>Willow stopped, no longer able to speak her throat constricted by the
overwhelming emotion she felt for her lover at this moment. Her eyes
shone with unshed tears and her entire body was trembling. </p>

<p>"Now you Slayer." the Abbot indicated to the petite blonde barely able
to control her own raw emotions the red head had made her feel. "It is
time to declare your true feelings and intentions." </p>

<p>Following her lover's example she leaned forward and tenderly placed the
white rose amulet around Willow's neck. Once the clasp closed, it also
disappeared leaving two fused links in it's place. </p>

<p>"I love you Wills." Buffy whispered reverently almost as if she were
praying. "I don't have a lot of fancy poetic words to describe how much
I feel.
If you were only in my heart or my mind we wouldn't be here, but what I
feel goes way beyond that.
You're in my heart, my mind, my soul, in the very core of my being. If I
was dissected and put under a microscope they would see you.
Without you there is no Slayer, no Buffy, I need you in my life to make
me complete. I want you in my life to be my love and life long
companion.
Please stay with me and never leave because, if you go, you take my
heart and soul with you leaving me nothing but a hollow shell, just
waiting to die." </p>

<p>As Buffy finished speaking the two amulets slowly changed the rhythm of
their pulsating until they became synchronized. </p>

<p>The Abbot stepped forward and gently placed one of his large strong hand
on each girls shoulder. </p>

<p>"Now the two are becoming one." the Abbot intoned repeating the words
he'd memorised years ago in preparation for just this moment. "You walk
the world as one, face adversity as one, and face the forces of Darkness
as one.
As you celebrate your union with your community and before the gods of
Light remember you face them as one.
What one feels the other feels, what one knows the other knows.
For now and forever your love and devotion have made you one that is
stronger than any force the Dark can bring against you.
My hopes, both for you and for humankind, go with you." </p>

<p>The Abbot turned and left the room without further comment. Buffy and
Willow shared a deep passionate kiss, then separated to look into each
other's eyes as if finding visions in their depths they'd never seen
before. </p>

<p>"Wow that..." Buffy began. </p>

<p>"...was different." Willow finished. </p>

<p>"Hey how did you..." </p>

<p>"...do that? I don't know..." </p>

<p>"...I just knew what you..." </p>

<p>"...were going to say." </p>

<p>The two girls looked at each other wide eyed with confusion. Every time
one of them had a thought the other would have the same thought at
almost the same moment. </p>

<p>"This is kinda..." Buffy started. </p>

<p>"...sorta really spooky." Willow again finished the thought. </p>

<p>They stared at each other for a few moments then they both remembered
the Abbot's words..What one knows the other knows. They smiled realizing
they were remembering the same thing and coming to the same conclusion,
time to go, they'd study this new phenomenon later. </p>

<p>They turned to look at Giles who was watching them fascinated by this
newly developed link, how fast the girls were adjusting to it, and
curious as to how deep it went. </p>

<p>"Giles, don't you..." Buffy started. </p>

<p>"...think we should really be going." Willow again finished. </p>

<p>"Well...ah...yes...I ah...suppose so." Giles answered still a little
taken back by the easy way Buffy and Willow simply slipped into this new
situation like it was nothing special, plus he wasn't sure which one to
answer. "We really need to talk though, very soon, so we can study this
new....ah...development." </p>

<p>"Fine, later but for now..." the Slayer spoke first. </p>

<p>"...let's pass out those weapons..." her lover continued without missing
a
beat. </p>

<p>"...and get moving." Buffy finished as she and Willow broke out giggling
at the look on Giles face. </p>

<p>When they'd first become lovers Buffy and Willow could tell what the
other was feeling with a lot of concentration, but now with a casual
effort they could share every conscious thought. </p>

<p>"Wow this is..." Buffy stated. </p>

<p>"..kinda weird but.." Willow continued. </p>

<p>"...it could be..." </p>

<p>"...really handy..." </p>

<p>"...not to mention..." </p>

<p>"...a lot of fun." </p>

<p>Both girls laughed at Giles as he rolled his eyes. </p>

<p>"You two are going to be impossible to live with now." the ex-watcher
sigh in mock frustration. "I'll never know who is speaking for who
or...or...oh Whatever." </p>

<p>Both girls beamed innocently at him, giving their surrogate father their
best 'who me' face causing the normally reserved man to chuckle at their
antics. </p>

<p>"I'm going to help the Brothers arm themselves." Giles said as he rose
from his chair. "And I'll have Brother Jeffrey come in and help you find
any items that may be useful to us tonight." </p>

<p>"Okay Giles and hey could you..." Buffy began. </p>

<p>"...also send in Xander and Cordy, I have a strange feeling..." Willow
joined in. </p>

<p>"...there's some stuff in here for them too." Buffy finished the girls
looking at each other perplexed over where that knowledge had come from. </p>

<p>Giles took one last look at the two girls before he left, pondering how
the shy, confused, uncertain children he'd met all those years ago had
turned into these strong, sure, confident young adults. Even Xander was
showing signs of maturity and strength that had been hidden deep inside
him for so long. </p>

<p>Giles realized he couldn't be prouder of the Scoobies (he laughed
quietly at the name the kids had given themselves years ago) if they
were his own children. </p>

<p>As he turned to finish his preparations he sent out a silent prayer that
they get through this night safely.</p>

<p align=center>*****</p>

<p>A few hours later Buffy and Willow walked out of the townhouse with
Xander and Cordelia, they walked together until they reached the main
through street. </p>

<p>They split up like they did every night, Xander and Cordelia turning
east toward their new apartment, and the Slayer and her partner headed
for one of the many cemeteries that were a large part of Sunnydale. </p>

<p>This night they headed south to the oldest of the cemeteries as planned. </p>

<p>Xander and Cordelia kept walking until the other two were out of sight,
and as sure as they could be that they weren't being followed, then they
quickly cut across back yards to get to Cordelia's car that she'd hidden
earlier. </p>

<p>They jumped in and headed for the rendezvous Giles had set up earlier
near the old cemetery where Giles had set up the ambush. </p>

<p>Around an hour later Giles and the four clerics left the townhouse and
as two groups made their way separately to meet the other two to set up
their part in the ambush. </p>

<p>As they neared their destination Giles was hoping the "secret weapon"
he'd sent for would come, preferably in time to help and that Buffy
wouldn't be mad at him for using it. </p>
