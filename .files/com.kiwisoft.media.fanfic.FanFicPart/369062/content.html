<p>Thank you all for reviewing and reading this story. I know the last part was kind of sad, but I promise they won't all be like that. Oh and there's Liley in this, of course - Gotta keep my readers happy! ;)</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter V</b></p>
<p>Lilly pulled into the parking space, noticing that there were more cars than usual. She hopped out of the SUV and hurried towards the building across the street. It had gotten even colder over the past few days and many people predicted the first snowfall wasn't far off now. Lilly had seen snow only once in her life, on a skiing trip with her parents when she was 12, so though most of her dreaded the cold, part of her was looking forward to a dusting of snow. Christmas was just around the corner and she was now halfway done with her Senior Year in High School. Life was good, except for one thing â€“ she hadn't seen Miley in days.</p>
<p>The door to the diner jingled when she entered and a blast of warm air greeted her immediately. Lilly rubbed her frozen hands together and unzipped her jacket to let in the warm air. The diner was busier than she had seen it in a long time and she wondered if the cold weather was driving Crowley Corner's residents indoors. Those that could not stay away from the gossip and 'action' of the small town now gathered here. There were a few empty stools along the bar and Lilly headed straight for the closest one, taking a seat. She didn't look around, but could almost feel the pair of eyes watching her. She had to suppress a grin.</p>
<p>A waitress appeared and Lilly looked up into the familiar face, trying to keep her face neutral. The woman gave her an exasperated look. "Lillyâ€¦"</p>
<p>Before she could continue, however, Lilly held up her hands. "I'm just here to order food, Mrs. Stewart, I swear. I'll even get it to go."</p>
<p>Susan sighed, close to regretting her punishment of Miley for the exhaustion she had caused herself with it, but nodded at last. "Fine, you may order, but no talking to Miley." She took Lilly's order and was about to leave, when she seemed to think and stopped. "No moving, either. Sit right here until I come back with your food."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and smiled, the perfect picture of innocence. As soon as Susan left, the angelic smile dropped from her face. She still had no idea what Miley had done to warrant such austere measures. She'd received a text from Miley's phone several days ago, a very abrupt and not at all informative 'Miley's grounded. No girlfriend for a week. Sorry Lilly, Mrs. Stewart'. And unlike previous failed attempts at confining Miley to her punishment, Lilly really had not heard nor seen from her girlfriend in those days. Today she'd decided she had had enough. It was one thing to punish Miley for whatever ridiculous prank she had pulled, but Lilly was being punished, too, and that just wasn't fair.</p>
<p>A quick glance left and right told her Susan was still in the back and Lilly moved just the slightest bit to swivel her chair around. Her eyes immediately went to the booth in the far back. Miley was actually doing homework for once, or at least trying to appear that she was, a customary glass of Coke and plate of fries sitting off to the side. Her eyes were focused intently on her book, as if she really was student of the year, but once she felt Lilly's eyes on her, Miley looked up.</p>
<p>There was an inherent sadness on her face that almost worried Lilly, but as soon as their eyes met, a face-splitting grin erupted on Miley's face. Lilly couldn't help but return it and so they sat, grinning at each other like love-stricken fools across the diner. Susan found them just like that when she returned a moment later. Her first reaction was to be angry, but when she saw that smile on Miley's face, it stopped her cold. That happy, exuberant smile she had spent days trying to force onto her daughter's face to no avail. No amount of bribing, cajoling, begging or threatening had gotten Miley to display just a hint of her usual hyperactive, mischievous and exuberant self, but one look from Lilly and there was her Miley.</p>
<p>At that moment Susan just wanted to call off the punishment, just to have Miley back to her old self, but knew it would only cause problems later on. She sighed. But maybe punishment didn't mean she couldn't be lenient for a few minutes. She stood behind the bar in front of Lilly and cleared her throat, noticing as soon as she'd come into view, Miley's eyes had snapped back to her book. Lilly turned, once again wearing that innocent smile.</p>
<p>"Wow, these chairs need tightening or something. It's like they swivel on their own," said Lilly, sounding almost believable if Susan didn't know better.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "Go sit with Miley until your food comes. But Lilly," she had to interrupt the girl who was already moving, "sit across from her. She's still grounded."</p>
<p>Lilly smiled and was already gone, sliding into the booth across from Miley, who was still deeply engrossed in her book. "Hey there, beautiful."</p>
<p>Miley grinned and looked up at her girlfriend, but suddenly grew worried. "Lils, I don't think I'm allowed to talk to you. I'm grounded."</p>
<p>"I'm here with permission. You've got me for however long it takes Don to make my Grilled Cheese."</p>
<p>Miley laughed, knowing if it really was Don making Lilly's food, they'd have a while. She pushed the book away from her and pulled the untouched plate of fries closer. She hadn't been very hungry, not since the night of the grounding really, but suddenly the fries looked delicious. She dumped a healthy amount of hot sauce on top of them while Lilly watched.</p>
<p>"So, Road kill, what'd you do this time?"</p>
<p>"Climbed a tree," said Miley with a shrug, not really keen to rehash what had gotten her into this predicament. "Momma's really mad this time."</p>
<p>Lilly noticed Miley's usual aloofness was missing from the second statement and narrowed her eyes. It did seem like a severe punishment for something Miley did without permission all the time and remembering the sadness she had seen in her girlfriend's eyes, she wondered if something else wasn't going on. "She can't be <b>that</b> mad, Miles. She did let me come over here for a few minutes."</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "It's cause of Richard. He's up to something and no one believes me. I don't think momma still wants me around."</p>
<p>Lilly reached across the table and grabbed both of Miley's hands, forcing their eyes to meet. "Miley, your mom loves you a whole lot, okay? I was there with her when you were in the hospital and unconscious and believe me, she'll <b>always</b> want you around. We're gonna figure this Richard thing out, okay?"</p>
<p>"You're good at knowing what to say," said Miley, smiling. Lilly laughed.</p>
<p>"It's my job. So, how about when your prison sentence is over, you and me, we go on a date?"</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Somewhere nice," grinned Lilly, already trying to think of places.</p>
<p>"I don't have to wear a fancy dress, do I?" asked Miley slightly apprehensive.</p>
<p>Lilly shook her head, knowing it would be foolish to consider a date spot where there was no chance of getting dirty. "No, but I bet you'd look gorgeous in a fancy dress."</p>
<p>"Oh, she does. I've got some pictures of her at her grandma's 65th birthday; remind me to show them to you next time, Lilly." Susan interrupted them by setting Lilly's food down in front of her, though she seemed fine with them talking and was smiling.</p>
<p>Lilly stood reluctantly, but didn't want to anger Susan when she had been somewhat accommodating. "Thanks, Mrs. Stewart, I can't wait to see those pictures. Road kill, be good, I'm gonna see you next week, right?"</p>
<p>Miley smirked - she just couldn't help it when someone told her to 'be good'. Susan noted her daughter's happier disposition and just wanted it to stay that way, but she couldn't just give in and let Miley get away with bad behavior. She settled on a compromise. "Lilly, why don't you come over Saturday for dinner, if you don't have any plans. We're having a movie night."</p>
<p>"I'm grounded until Monday," said Miley, drawing two incredulous looks.</p>
<p>Susan shook her head. "Miley Ray, I swear," she sighed and turned to Lilly, "Lilly, just come over on Saturday."</p>
<p>Lilly nodded, happy she wouldn't have to go into Miley withdrawal and for the chance to really talk to her girlfriend about this whole Richard thing. She zipped up her jacket and went to grab her food, when she darted forward and planted a much too quick kiss on Miley's lips. She picked up her box of food and turned to Susan with her well-perfected smile of innocence. "Wow, the floor is really slippery right here."</p>
<p>Susan almost wanted to laugh, but tried to keep a stern face. Lilly said her goodbyes and left. Miley sighed heavily and looked out the window, but the silly grin on her face told Susan she was daydreaming. She smiled, just happy Miley was no longer the pitiful thing she had been before, but nevertheless pointed at the forgotten book.</p>
<p>"Finish your homework, hun, you can daydream later. I'll get you some more fries." Susan took Miley's plate and before she left, brushed a hand across her daughter's hair. As she walked away she realized it was the first time she had gotten to do so in days.</p>
<p><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>The delicious smell of fresh-baked cookies greeted Lilly when she entered the door and she immediately knew something was up. Flinging the door shut, she dropped her backpack in the hallway and made her way into the kitchen. Her mother was there to greet her, wearing a smile Lilly found suspicious.</p>
<p>"Hi honey, how was school?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged and gave a noncommittal groan that ought to indicate to her mother not to ask further questions. She'd be happy just to survive the upcoming week of tests teachers had invented just to spoil the beginning of winter break. Lilly walked into the kitchen, going straight for the tray of cookies cooling on the counter. She stole one and took a bite, immediately feeling better.</p>
<p>She turned to her mom, eyebrow raised. "So mom, are you gonna tell me what's up?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" asked Heather innocently, stacking some papers on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>Lilly gestured at the cookies. "You don't like to cook, so something bad has or will happen if you're buttering me up."</p>
<p>"Please, I don't have to bribe my own daughter," said Heather, laughing, but seeing Lilly's continued incredulity, she rolled her eyes. "Fine, I want to talk to you about something. Come sit down."</p>
<p>Lilly had a bad feeling, but sat opposite her mother. Heather laid out a few brochures and letters on the table in front of them. Lilly's stomach dropped as soon as she realized what they were â€“ college applications.</p>
<p>"Your father and I just thought that it was about time you put some real thought into which schools to apply to."</p>
<p>"Mom, Iâ€¦"</p>
<p>Heather interrupted her. "No, I know you don't have to make a decision just yet, but you do need to pick out some schools to apply to. I've picked up a few brochures of the schools I think you'd like."</p>
<p>Lilly glanced down at the colorful pamphlets, with their smiling students and beautiful scenery. She shook her head. "Mom, you don't honestly think I can get into Stanford, do you? And I told you, I'm applying to Middle Tennessee State."</p>
<p>Heather sighed. "It doesn't have to be Stanford, honey. You always wanted to go to UCLA, whatever happened to that? I'm sure Middle Tennessee is a good school, but it's no UCLA."</p>
<p>"So you only want me to apply to great schools? What if I apply to Vanderbilt then, will that make you happy?"</p>
<p>"Lilly, I don't want you to make me or your father happy with this, but honestly, you don't even like Tennessee, why would you want to go to school here?"</p>
<p>Lilly shrugged and crossed her arms, defensive now. "I like Tennessee just fine."</p>
<p>Heather inclined her head, her voice soft when she spoke. "You like <b>Miley</b> just fine, I think. Tennessee isn't what this is about."</p>
<p>"So what? Miley is my girlfriend and I love her; what's so wrong about going to a school nearby?"</p>
<p>"Oh honey, you know your father and I love Miley, we think she is great, but you can't plan your whole future around a girl you've been dating for a few months."</p>
<p>"What if Miley is my future?"</p>
<p>Heather scoffed. "Come on now, don't be melodramatic. You have to go to college, Lilly. Even your brother is getting a college education; there is no way you're getting out of it."</p>
<p>"I never said I wasn't gonna go, I just said I was gonna go here," said Lilly, trying not to sound angry.</p>
<p>"Why don't you think about it some?"</p>
<p>"I <b>have</b> thought about it, mom. And I <b>think</b> I want to go here. Look, it'd even be cheaper. I could live at home and by the time I enroll I'd get in-state tuition, which I can't get in California anymore."</p>
<p>Heather sighed, brushing a hand across the glossy Stanford brochure. "Well, regardless we want you to apply to a few schools that are not in Tennessee, okay? It doesn't have to be Stanford, or UCLA, but something that isn't here."</p>
<p>"Shouldn't it be my choice where I apply?" asked Lilly, unable to contain her annoyance now.</p>
<p>"Not if you want us to pay. Here you go, take these up to your room." Heather handed Lilly a stack of brochures and stood, effectively ending the conversation. Lilly stalked off, too mad to even consider stealing another conciliatory cookie.</p>
