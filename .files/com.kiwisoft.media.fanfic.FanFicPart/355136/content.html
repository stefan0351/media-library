<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Fifteen -->

<p>Brooke stood nervously outside Sam's bedroom door. She wanted
and needed to talk to Sam about what had just happened. The kiss had meant a lot
to her but not at the cost of her relationship with Sam. And she knew she should
have thought of that before she followed her hormones into action. But it was
too late now to take back what she did. The best she could hope for was that Sam
would let her explain it. </p>
<p>She raised her hand to knock and watched as it hovered
uselessly in front of her. She was afraid of what Sam might have to say.
</p>
<p>(God, she must hate me. I keep screwing up and hurting her. I
don't mean to. I just can't seem to stop myself) Brooke thought to herself. </p>
<p>(Was the 'old' me such a moron, too?) </p>
<p>She lowered her hand with a sigh and started pacing the
hallway. She had to find a way to not only explain herself and her actions to
Sam, but express herself as well. She wanted there to be no doubt in Sam's mind
as to how she felt. Even if Sam didn't, or couldn't, return those feelings,
Brooke needed her to understand. </p>
<p>She took a deep cleansing breath to calm herself, marched to
Sam's door and rapped sharply. There was no response. </p>
<p>"Sam?" she called through the door while knocking again. "Sam,
can I talk to you, please?" </p>
<p>"Sam no es casero," came through the door a few seconds later.
Brooke rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"No hablo Españoles, Sam," she sighed back sarcastically. </p>
<p>"Sam n'est pas ici," this time in French. </p>
<p>"Damn it, Sam!" Brooke shouted. She wasn't in the mood for
games. Especially since she could tell by the tone of Sam's voice that she was
upset. </p>
<p>"Fine," Sam snapped. "Sam isn't in right now. If you'd like to
leave a message, wait for the beep. BEEP!" </p>
<p>Brooke sighed. She knew that there was no way she was going to
get through to Sam with the brunette acting the way she was. </p>
<p>"OK, Sam, I'm going to sit right here outside your door until
you decide to speak to me," Brooke declared while flopping herself down onto the
floor. After a few minutes she heard Sam walk towards the door and looked up in
hope. </p>
<p>"Not right now, OK Brooke?" Sam asked through the door, almost
begging. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"Sammy, we need to talk. I need to explain..." she started. </p>
<p>"I know. We will...just not right now," Sam responded. "I need
to think, process stuff." </p>
<p>(Well, at least she gave me an honest answer) Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"All right, Sam. We'll do things your way for now," she said
defeated. She didn't want to push too hard and lose Sam altogether. "But when
you're ready, come and get me so that we can talk." </p>
<p>Sam didn't answer so Brooke got up and went into her own room.
After she settled down on the bed, she heard Sam's stereo turn on. Loudly. </p>
<p>(Tuning the world out, huh Sammy? I don't blame you. I kinda
wish I could go back and redo today) she yawned. She wiped at the mournful tears
that had begun falling. Eventually. between the alcohol she'd drank and the
emotional stress, Brooke fell fast asleep. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam padded around her room a bit after Brooke left trying to
decided what to do with herself. She was buzzed from the wine coolers, keyed up
from the kiss, and absolutely sick thinking that her relationship with Brooke
was destroyed. </p>
<p>(All because you couldn't control yourself when Brooke is
obviously confused. I bet she doesn't even understand why I panicked. Hell, I
don't understand it) </p>
<p>She flipped through her CDs looking for something appropriate
to listen to. She wanted something heavy and hard but not too angry. Finally she
decided on her Tantric CD. It seemed to be suitable. </p>
<p>After setting the volume a bit louder than usual, she flopped
down on her bed lost in thought. </p>
<p>(Oh God, she kissed me! There was no mistaking the intent
behind that kiss) she realized, almost giggling. Almost. </p>
<p>(But I can't let that happen. She has no memory of who she
was, how WE were. As much as I want her...LOVE her, I can't lead her into this
mistake. There's too much at stake) </p>
<p>She stared at the ceiling while running her memory of their
kiss through her mind. Her lips still tingled and it felt like her whole body
was humming. </p>
<p>(God, she tasted good) Sam remembered. (And she's a fantastic
kisser. Her lips are soft like rose petals and tasted vaguely like...like...)
she searched her memory. </p>
<p>(Vanilla) she realized with a smirk. (She tasted like smooth
vanilla ice cream. Crap, I'm winding myself up) </p>
<p>She took a deep breath and let the pull of sleep take her into
dreams of her hazel eyed angel. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam woke the next morning wondering if the whole incident was
an alcohol and porn induced fantasy. With a sigh at how complicated things were
getting, she went into the bathroom to splash some cold water on her face. While
in the bathroom she shared with Brooke, she heard broken sobs coming from the
blonde's bedroom. Her heart broke to hear such pain coming from Brooke.
</p>
<p>Sam walked to the door leading into Brooke's room and
hesitantly tried the handle. She was mildly surprised to find it unlocked. She
was nervous about talking to Brooke about the previous nights events but her
need to comfort the girl was stronger. She walked into the room, over to the bed
and gathered the crying blonde into her arms. </p>
<p>"Shhh, Brooke, it's OK," she cooed to try and calm the girl.
Brooke sobbed and cried harder. </p>
<p>"Easy Brooke, you're going to make yourself sick," Sam
whispered. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry...I didn't mean...I don't want to make you mad.
Please don't hate me, Sammy. I need you. I'll die if you hate me," Brooke
babbled barely coherent. </p>
<p>"Brooke," Sam broke in gently. Brooke pulled away and looked
at Sam with wide eyes full of fear and remorse. </p>
<p>"I'll die, Sam. You're all I got. If you hate me then I'll
have no one. Nobody else cares about me, they all want 'their' Brooke back. I've
tried, Sammy, but I can't be her. I don't WANT to be her," Brooke continued. </p>
<p>"You're all I have, my one constant. You've never asked
anything of me but to be who I am. You trusted me when I know how hard that is
for you. And you've taken care of me. But all I seem to do in return is hurt and
betray you. I broke your trust, Sam, not once but twice. Each time I've kissed
you I've abused your trust and faith in me. The two things that let me close to
you and mean the most. You must hate me for it. I hate myself," she finished.
Sam sighed and wiped away some of the moisture on Brooke's face. </p>
<p>"Oh Brooke," she started. "I told you I don't hate you. I
never could. There's nothing you could do to make me hate you. You haven't
betrayed me or abused my trust, I swear." </p>
<p>"But why," Brooke hiccuped. "Why did you freak when I kissed
you last night? I thought...I thought you wanted it too," she finished barely
above a whisper. Sam ran a frustrated hand through her hair. </p>
<p>"Brooke..." she started and stopped. She frowned as she tried
to collect her thoughts. She had no idea how to say what she wanted to without
it hurting Brooke. </p>
<p>"I don't know why I freaked, really," she admitted honestly.
"And honestly, Brooke, I did want you to kiss me." She watched as Brooke's eyes
lit up but shook her head at the blonde. </p>
<p>"But," she drawled reluctantly. "It shouldn't have happened.
It CAN'T happen." </p>
<p>"But Sammy," Brooke cut in sadly. Sam looked away unable to
meet the blonde's imploring gaze. If she did look, Sam knew that she'd lose her
resolve. </p>
<p>"Brooke," came the heavy sigh as Sam stared at the far wall.
"You're my friend, my BEST friend. Plus we're going to be stepsisters soon.
Whatever it is you think you feel, whatever my feelings might be, we can't. It's
not right." Brooke frowned at her and tried to catch Sam's gaze. </p>
<p>"Not right? Why? Cuz we're both girls?" she asked slightly
offended. Sam smirked and then raspberried the idea. </p>
<p>"Hell no, I could care less about that," she told Brooke with
a slight blush. </p>
<p>"So, you ARE gay, Sammy?" Brooke asked, needing to know. Sam
chewed on her bottom lip for a moment before answering. </p>
<p>"Bi, actually. I find both men AND women atrractive. I'm
attracted to both. Women more so, but guys too," she confessed shyly. She had
never told anyone before. "I've known for a while now." Brooke smiled.
</p>
<p>"Thank you for trusting me with that, it means a lot. I know
it wasn't easy to tell me," she said. "So what's the problem? I'm gay, or bi, or
whichever you wanna use and I have feelings for you," she stopped and thought a
minute. </p>
<p>"Are you not attracted to me?" she asked Sam quietly. She was
startled when Sam started to laugh. </p>
<p>"God, I'd have to be blind or dead NOT to be. You're gorgeous,
you have a killer body, and you're a nice person too. That's a rare package,"
Sam assured her. "But that's not the issue." </p>
<p>"OK, I'm confused," Brooke said simply. "I have feelings for
you; you're attracted to me. We both like women. The problem is where? Because
I'm not following." </p>
<p>"Brooke, we can't persue a relationship or whatever it is you
want because it's not right." </p>
<p>"OK, that's twice you've said that. Care to explain?"
</p>
<p>"Brooke, think of our friends and family. How THEY'LL react,"
Sam tried to reason. </p>
<p>"Screw 'em. It's our life, not theirs," Brooke argued.
</p>
<p>"True but..." Sam faltered for a minute and then bowed her
head. "I won't use you that way," she added so quietly that Brooke almost missed
it. </p>
<p>"Use me? Sammy, how would you be using me?" </p>
<p>"I know I said that I don't care if your memory returns, and I
still don't. But if we get involved regardless of what everyone ends up
thinking, and then your memory returns...I'll lose everything," she finished as
a few tears rolled down her face. </p>
<p>"Oh Sam, you'd never lose me," Brooke began. Sam shook her
head. </p>
<p>"You don't get it. We could be going along together, having a
relationship and enjoying ourselves and BAM, your memory returns. And then
you'll see what a mistake it was. The 'old' Brooke wouldn't want me or care for
me in THAT way and not only would I lose that, YOU, but I'd lose HER friendship.
I can't do that. I wouldn't be able to take that," Sam explained mournfully. </p>
<p>"Sam..." </p>
<p>"There's that and then there's more. Face it, Brooke, you may
THINK that you feel something for me but who's to say you're not mistaking deep
affection, gratitude even, for something more? You've already said a few times
how much you depend on me. Can you honestly say that what you think you're
feeling for me right now isn't much simpler, like deep friendship?" </p>
<p>"YES!" Brooke exclaimed. "I DO know it's more than friendship.
I love you, Sam. I want you. You're all I think about, dream about." </p>
<p>As much as those were the things Sam wanted to hear, the
consequences were too much of a chance for her to take. She cupped the sides of
Brooke's face in her palms and stared into the blonde's eyes. She brushed her
lips against Brooke's feeling the other girl lean into her. Reluctantly breaking
away, Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Brooke, beautiful...we can't," she reiterated. "There's too
much at stake. It's too much of a risk." Brooke frowned and looked longingly at
Sam. She needed to find a way through the walls of reason and fear that Sam was
projecting. She knew that Sam had valid points but she didn't care about them.
She didn't see why other people's opinions should matter or hold barring on
their lives. She knew of only one way to convince Sam that she was sincere and
that the chance was worth taking. </p>
<p>"She loved you too, Sammy," she whispered. Sam frowned in
confusion. </p>
<p>"Huh?" </p>
<p>"Brooke, I mean who she was before the accident. She had
feelings for you too," Brooke explained. Sam's eyes grew wide in shock and
disbelief. </p>
<p>"That's not funny," she snapped. "And how would you know
anyway?" Brooke looked away ashamed that she had upset Sam. </p>
<p>"Her diary. It said things about you. They started out slow
and then her dreams started," she looked back up into Sam's brown eyes and
decided to lay it all out for her. </p>
<p>"I found and read her diary. She dreamed about you, dreamed of
making love to you. Even while she was dating Harrison, you were who she longed
for Sam. Some of her entries were very detailed," she blushed with a small
smile. "What she imagined you'd look like, how you'd feel, the way you'd touch
her." </p>
<p>"Stop, please," Sam begged. Her resolve was quickly
fracturing. </p>
<p>"Don't you see, Sam? She dated Harrison because she was in
denial about her feelings for you. She was afraid of your rejection, of the
consequences. The same things that you're afraid of now. But there ARE no
consequences. Even if my memory does return and some of the old Brooke comes
back, I'll still feel the same way. You have nothing to lose." </p>
<p>"I could still lose everything, Brooke," Sam protested.
</p>
<p>"How? When I just told you that she loved you too?"
</p>
<p>"Everyone fantasizes. It doesn't necessarily mean anything." </p>
<p>"Weak argument, Sam," Brooke told her shortly. "You're just
looking for any excuse because you're scared of letting me close to you."
</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," Sam confessed. Brooke reached out and stroked the
brunettes face. </p>
<p>"There's nothing to be afraid of, Sammy," she whispered
leaning close enough to feel Sam's breath against her face. "Especially me. I'd
never hurt you." She captured Sam's lips in a searing passionate kiss that left
them both breathless. </p>
<p>"I want you, Sam," Brooke growled, kissing Sam again and
drawing Sam's bottom lip between her teeth, slightly biting as she drew away. </p>
<p>"But..." Sam half-heartedly protested as Brooke's hands
started to wander over her body. She really didn't have an argument for the
blonde anymore as her body made its desires well known. </p>
<p>"No buts, Sammy. There is no tomorrow, no yesterday. Only now,
this one moment. Let me show you how much I care for you," Brooke asked
lovingly. "Let me make love to you." Sam felt the last wall crash down within
her and the floodgates to her emotions release. There was nothing, no one she
wanted more in that moment than Brooke McQueen. </p>
<p>"Oh God, Brooke," she half-sobbed as her emotions washed over
her. "Please." </p>
<p>"Thank you," Brooke said reverently. </p>
