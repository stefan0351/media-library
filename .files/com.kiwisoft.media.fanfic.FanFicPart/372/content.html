<!-- Runs In The Family \ null -->

<p>The knock on the door was completely out of the blue, but when Sam
	McPherson opened it, a huge grin spread itself over her face. </p>

	<p>"Mac! Long time no see! Come in, come in!"</p>

	<p>MacKenzie McPherson McQueen stepped inside the apartment carefully,
	trying not to disturb the piles of suitcases and boxes
	everywhere. "That'll be the whole `Year in England' thing," she
	retorted. "How was it?" </p>

	<p>Sam smiled. "Awesome. But I think we're going to have to talk about
	you, my beautiful baby sister. God, you got so big while I was away!"</p>

	<p>"I'm almost fourteen," Mac mumbled. </p>

	<p>"I know that! It's tomorrow, isn't it?"</p>

	<p>"Yeah." Mac seemed pleased that Sam remembered. But then, when had
	she ever forgotten?</p>

	<p>Sam, age thirty, had just spent a year in England with her job. It
	had been a blast, but she was glad when she arrived home a couple of
	days ago. It was all very well and good having a good time halfway
	across the world, but she had missed her family. MacKenzie had
	changed considerably while she had been away. Her thick brown hair,
	the very image of Sam's, had grown about ten inches, so that it hang
	well down her back like a waterfall. She'd gained about the same in
	height, standing shoulder to shoulder with Sam. for now. It was
	obvious she'd be towering over Sam by the time she'd finished
	growing, as she'd inherited the same height gene that Brooke
	possessed. Mac also had Brooke's big hazel eyes, but she had Sam's
	cute little nose. </p>

	<p>Actually, Mac had pretty much received all the winning genes from
	the McPherson McQueen gene pool, personifying only the good points
	of both her older sisters. She was a very beautiful girl. Looking at
	her, Sam knew it wouldn't be long before she was breaking hearts on
	a regular basis. </p>

	<p>"So tell me about you," Sam insisted. "What's been going on with
	you? Your letters didn't exactly contain a wealth of information.
	Tell me all. How's school, how are your friends, how is your." She
	paused dramatically, ".love life?"</p>

	<p>Mac blushed. "Let me go at my own pace," she moaned. </p>

	<p>About half an hour later, Sam called for a pizza as they sat on the
	sofa and Mac told about school. </p>

	<p>"Ever since I've started at Kennedy, people mistake me for you all
	the time. My English teacher just cannot grasp the fact that my name
	is MacKenzie, not Samantha. And don't even get me started on
	Science."</p>

	<p>"Who'd you get?" Sam giggled. </p>

	<p>"Some teacher with a metal claw where her finger should be. She's
	creepy, and for some reason she always calls me `McJunior.' I mean,
	what's that about?"</p>

	<p>"The infamous Claw," Sam commiserated. "Brooke and I had her. Since
	we lived together, and our last names both started the same, she
	called us the McSisters. And there were numerous other plays on our
	names, too many to mention. And you have both our last names."</p>

	<p>"Oh, great," Mac groaned. </p>

	<p>"So what about your friends? Tell me about them."</p>

	<p>"Well, Jason is a thing of the past."</p>

	<p>"Why?"</p>

	<p>"He tried to kiss me, and I was like, uh, no, and pushed him away.
	But he looked like a sad puppy dog, so finally I kissed him, and it
	was okay, but nothing spectacular. Then I told him we'd be better
	off as friends, friends who DIDN'T kiss, and he got real whiny and
	told me he loved me. I dropped him like a hot tamale."</p>

	<p>Sam laughed. "What about friends that are girls?"</p>

	<p>For some reason, Mac's face got kind of red. "Okay, this is the
	tricky part." Sam waited patiently for her to gather her thoughts. </p>

	<p>"You know I've always been friends with Jamie, right? Well, she
	dropped me for the cheerleaders as soon as we got to Kennedy. So I
	was pretty bummed about that, but then there was Melody."</p>

	<p>Her voice trailed off, and she got a far away look in her eyes. But
	she soon snapped back. </p>

	<p>"Melody transferred from this private school in Boston to start
	Kennedy the same time as us. Everyone wanted to be her friend, but
	it was like she only wanted me. I was still reeling from the Jamie
	thing, so I was so happy."</p>

	<p>"And then what happened?"</p>

	<p>"Sam, how did you know that you were gay?" Mac blurted, her face
	turning puce. Sam's eyes got big, but she gulped down her surprise
	and answered as truthfully as she could. </p>

	<p>"I honestly don't know how I knew, I just knew, somehow," she
	said. "But the moment I knew for sure was the first time I kissed
	Brooke. It was incredible."</p>

	<p>"Thought so," Mac mumbled. Sam leaned over and hugged her. "Is there
	something else you wanna tell me?"</p>

	<p>"I kissed Melody the other day," Mac said, looking Sam straight in
	the eye. "And it was fabulous."</p>

	<p>"So what are you going to do now?"</p>

	<p>Mac looked thoughtful. "I don't want everyone to know. You're the
	only person I've told. But I don't want to not kiss her again. I
	mean, I really, really like her. And when she kissed me."</p>

	<p>"She kissed you?" Sam teased. "Let's hear the whole story, shall we?"</p>

	<p>"Okay. I was under the bleachers, looking for this pen that fell
	while I was top of said bleachers. She had been sitting next to me,
	and since this search was taking longer than anticipated, she came
	down to help me. We found the pen. my favorite pen, by the way. and
	then we kind of sat down under there, and we started talking."</p>

	<p>"About what?"</p>

	<p>"Everything. Anything. Nothing. We were just talking. Then all of a
	sudden, she says she left her other school cos she was caught
	kissing another girl, and my heart started racing. And then, really
	slowly, I guess giving me time to stop her, she leaned in and
	brushed her lips over mine. And then I. I. I kind of grabbed her and
	kissed her harder, and then I honestly don't know how it happened,
	but we were making out under the bleachers! God, her hands, and my
	hands, and then there was her, lying next to me, kissing me."</p>

	<p>"God, Mac, that sounds incredible."</p>

	<p>"It was more than incredible."</p>

	<p>"Do you love her?"</p>

	<p>"I don't know. Maybe."</p>

	<p>"So are you going to tell Brooke, or is this information just for
	me?"</p>

	<p>"I don't know. You can tell her if you want. Anyhow, thanks for the
	pizza, but I guess I better go."</p>

	<p>"Want me to tell you the story of how Brooke and I first hooked up
	before you go?"</p>

	<p>"Yeah!"</p>

	<p>"Well, in the beginning, I hated her. She hated me. I hated her
	friends. Her friends hated me. My friends lusted after her. Can you
	see the position I was in?"</p>

	<p>"Not a good one, obviously."</p>

	<p>"Obviously. Then I had to move in with her, and it was like suddenly
	all my hatred for her just melted away. There was no way I could kid
	myself that she was a bad person after living with her. Brooke
	McQueen was, always had been, and always will be, an angel. My
	Princess."</p>

	<p>"But what happened next?"</p>

	<p>"I was going out with George Austin at the time, call it denial if
	you want. At least it wasn't Harrison! But when he broke up with me,
	I was more upset than I thought I'd be. Brooke caught me bawling on
	my bed, and lay down next to me, and gave me a big hug. I cried
	myself to sleep, and when I woke up, she was still there, holding
	me. The big revelations came out, and we admitted we liked each
	other perhaps more than we should. Then we kissed. And just like you
	said, Mac, it was incredible, more than incredible. It was
	perfection."</p>

	<p>"So how long have you and Brooke been together now?" Mac asked,
	snuggling into her sister. Sam wrapped her arms around the smaller
	girl, and held her tight. She really loved the munchkin. </p>

	<p>"Over fourteen blissful years." Brooke answered before Sam could, as
	she walked in the door carrying groceries. "Hey baby," she greeted
	Sam with a smoldering kiss. "Sup, munchkin," she greeted Mac. </p>

	<p>"Hey, Princess," Sam said, trying to regain her breath and return
	her breathing to normal. </p>

	<p>"Hey Brookie," Mac said, reaching out for a hug. "Did you enjoy
	England?"</p>

	<p>"I'd enjoy Antarctica if Sam was with me."</p>

	<p>"I'm going to go," Mac repeated her earlier words. "But thanks for
	reassuring me Sammy. I think I'm going to go for it. not that it
	hasn't been gone for already."</p>

	<p>"I know what you mean," Sam interrupted. "And it's fine. Is Brooke
	allowed to know?"</p>

	<p>"Sure, whatever," Mac said, her face going red again as she slipped
	out the door. </p>

	<p>"What was that all about?" Brooke asked, moving to lie on top of
	Sam. Their bodies were in full contact, and Sam was getting hotter,
	and hotter. She felt like if she didn't ravish this lovely woman on
	top of her, the world would end. </p>

	<p>"Mac's got a girlfriend," she replied absently. "But can we talk
	about that later?"</p>

	<p>"Whatever you want," Brooke agreed, kissing Sam and unbuttoning her
	blouse. </p>
