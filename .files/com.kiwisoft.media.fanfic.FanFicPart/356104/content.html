<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 21 -->

<p>The next day B'Elanna and Annika were up before dawn.  They helped one another dress and then B'Elanna began to stretch and prepare herself for the sword fights in which she was scheduled to participate.  When her stretches were complete Annika rubbed her shoulders and back before helping her into her armour. She tied one of her scarves around B'Elanna's arm as a token and then buckled her lover's sword around her waist.</p>
<p>"Good luck today my love," she said softly, kissing B'Elanna's cheek gently.</p>
<p>B'Elanna held her wife close; drawing strength from the love they shared.  She picked up her helmet and then she and Harry left for the sword ring.  She was relieved to see that her matches for the day were all against men she had fought and defeated many times previously.  Getting a few fights out of the way to allow her nerves to settle was import if she were to be at her best to face the soldiers of the King's companies later in the tournament.  The first matches were close as everyone put forth an extra effort to win here in London, but as yet nobody had found a way to defeat B'Elanna's superior speed and skill.  The crowd began to roar her name after the first fight and once again she found herself touted as a favourite to win the event.</p>
<p>She watched several of the matches involving the King's soldiers and she was impressed with the strength of the men.  She took hope however in seeing that none of them seemed particularly quick.  She allowed herself a moment's hope before she forced her mind back to observing and preparing for the task at hand.  She easily progressed through the preliminary rounds and she went to bed early that evening knowing tomorrow would bring far greater challenges.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's first match the next day was against her greatest rival from the outlying tournaments.  They were friendly together outside of the sword ring and they chatted amiably while they waited for the bans to be called announcing their match.  Lord Dumphries described his match against one of the King's soldiers and offered B'Elanna what advice he could on how to defend against the superior strength and savvy of the battle-hardened men.  Dumphries had won his match, but only barely and he advised B'Elanna to attack swiftly and try to end the match before the force of their blows wore her down.  She thanked him for his advice and knew that it would serve her well to follow it.  </p>
<p>She and Dumphries squared off in the lists together and put on a masterful show of swordsmanship for the gathered crowds.  B'Elanna could sense that Dumphries was tired after his matches the day before and she could have ended the match sooner had she chosen, but she knew that her friend deserved better than to be rousted so thoroughly in front of this crowd and so she allowed the match to go on and Dumphries to make a good showing.  In the end she finished him off and accepted his congratulations as well as his gratitude as the crowd roared their approval.</p>
<p>She had an hour before her next bout so she decided to stay and watch some of the other matches.  Harry and the others fetched food from the camp and they stood on the fringes of the crowd and watched as the other Knights fought their battles.  B'Elanna was feeling good and the fact that her family was around her added strength to her conviction that she would be able to win even against the King's men.</p>
<p>When she entered the lists for her next match she took the measure of the man she was to face.  He towered above her and his armour was dented and scored from fighting on the fields of France.  She saw stains at the joints that looked suspiciously like dried blood, and she had to force herself to calm down and concentrate on the battle ahead.  They circled one another slowly at first and she could tell by her opponent's leisurely feints that he was not taking her at all seriously.  Her small stature and shining armour led him to believe that she was a mere dilettante and that he would easily defeat her.  His overconfidence was to her advantage and she quickly scored two points before he realized that he had a real fight on his hands.  He pressed her hard and she fell back in the face of his renewed onslaught.  She parried and dodged for all she was worth, and, as she hoped, he was not quick enough to land a scoring blow.  The match dragged on as his height made it difficult for B'Elanna to score another hit.  Finally she took a chance and allowed him to step inside her defenses.  He swung mightily and the hit nearly drove her to her knees, but she managed to keep her feet, and, as he was sufficiently off balance from the weight of his swing, she was able to score the winning hit before he regained his equilibrium.</p>
<p>The rest of the matches went much the same and although she remained undefeated at the end of the day, thus ensuring herself a spot in the finals, she paid a physical price that was much higher than usual.  When Annika helped her out of her armour that night she was shocked to see the extent of the bruising B'Elanna had suffered even through the plate of her armour.  She rubbed the liniment Sarah had prepared into the bruises and aches and B'Elanna felt better almost immediately.  Annika had to bite her tongue to stop herself from begging her wife to withdraw from the finals.  She couldn't bear to see the raven-haired woman hurt but she knew that B'Elanna would never consent to quit the tournament and that what she needed most was her unswerving support; she forced herself to put aside her own feelings and offer encouragement instead. She lay awake long into the night watching B'Elanna's peaceful sleep; hoping fervently that she wouldn't be too badly hurt in the days ahead.</p>
<p>The next morning was peaceful around the camp, as B'Elanna's final sword contest wasn't until the early afternoon.  They sat around the site talking quietly while cleaning and repairing equipment.  Sarah cooked a special stew that she insisted B'Elanna have two helpings of before her duel.  The young warrior was afraid that she would feel overly full and too sluggish to fight, however her fears were unfounded, as she felt stronger and more energetic than ever after the meal was over.  She tried to get Sarah to tell her the secret of her cooking, but the young woman simply smiled and demurred.  Eventually B'Elanna decided to stop questioning her good luck and be grateful for it.</p>
<p>When she buckled on her armour with the help of Annika they spoke quietly about the upcoming battle, and as ever B'Elanna felt herself strengthened by Annika's love and faith in her abilities.  She could sense that the beautiful blonde was worried that she would be hurt and she hastened to reassure her that she was able to take care of herself.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Annika, I'll be fine this afternoon."</p>
<p>"I know my love.  I can't help but worry about you, but I trust in your skill.  I have yet to see the man who can stand against you when you put your mind to a task."</p>
<p>"Indeed beloved, you are the only one I know who can stop me when I get an idea in my head."</p>
<p>"I'll believe that when I see it my Lord," Annika smiled.</p>
<p>"We'd better hurry or you won't get a good spot from which to see the fight."</p>
<p>"Yes it would be a shame if I couldn't get close enough to the lists to hear your grunting and be splashed with the sweat of the contestants.  I so miss that when I have to take a seat further away from the ring."  Annika finished tightening the buckles on B'Elanna's armour as she spoke, then helped her to her feet.</p>
<p>"Come on darling; its time for you to go win a championship."</p>
<p>They linked arms and walked toward the sword lists with the rest of the group falling in behind them as they made their way through the crowd.  They did manage to arrive at the ring in enough time for everyone to find a place to stand close to the fence.  All of her joking aside Annika liked to be close to sword ring so that she could keep an eye on B'Elanna as she fought.  Harry doubled checked B'Elanna's armour while she watched her opponent as he performed the same ritual on the other side of the ring.  He was a tall man with jet-black hair and darker skin that was marred by a long jagged scar that ran from his temple down his face and disappeared into his armour.  His mail was coal black and was liberally dented; it looked to be the armour of a man who had faced and defeated many opponents on the field of battle.</p>
<p>When they entered the ring he barely returned her salute before he snapped his visor into place and swung fiercely at her head.  She was forced to block his attack with her visor still open, and it was all she could do to parry his blows.  She stumbled backward around the ring, unused to feeling so off balance and back on her heels.  She was surprised when she felt the logs of the sword ring at her back.  She had nowhere left to go.  Her opponent raised his sword and brought it down with unbelievable force.  B'Elanna took the blow on the blade of her sword and the two weapons slid the length of one another until they jammed together at the hilts.  She took her chance and used the logs at her back to launch herself bodily against the dark knight. He couldn't hold her in place and she growled loudly as she gave him a mighty shove that sent him sprawling.</p>
<p>While he got to his feet she got her breathing under control and fastened her visor down, protecting her face.  When he regained his feet he did not rush back into the battle straight away.  This time he circled her slowly; finding himself flat on his back had given him a certain amount of respect for the diminutive knight he found himself facing. They both feinted lightly a few times, testing to see if there was a weakness that could be exploited.  Neither of them found a chink in the defenses of the other and B'Elanna resigned herself to hard fought battle.  The dark knight attacked again; his blows were a blur of metal and B'Elanna fought down a rising tide of panic.  She fought to control her emotions and was successful when she heard Annika's voice in her head telling her that she believed in her.  She was skillful in her defense and after a moment her opponent fell back to reassess his strategy.  She took advantage of this lull and rushed forward on the attack.  She constantly led him to the left, her weaker side.  All of her thrusts came from that side and as soon as she saw him settle into a routine she thrust quickly from the right and was rewarded with the sound of metal on metal as her blow went home and she scored the first point of the match.</p>
<p>Once again they circled slowly and B'Elanna was content to let the older man bring the attack to her once more.  She defended well, and was relieved to feel the fury of his attacks abating.  Perhaps he was tiring.  She renewed her efforts and was rewarded again when he misjudged her thrust and she managed to score a weak hit to his shoulder.  Weak as it was, the hit counted and she was one strike away from winning the match cleanly.  She allowed her jubilation to distract her for a moment, but that was all it took for the other knight to knock her sword aside and land a huge blow on the side of her helmet.  For a moment her world went black, and then erupted in a fireworks of colour.  The roar of the crowd seemed to fade away to an indistinguishable mutter, and then her head felt as if it exploded in a blinding burst of pain.  She felt her opponent land another scoring blow before she could pull herself together enough to defend against his attacks.  She was feeling dizzy and her vision was blurred, but she managed to hold herself together long enough stay in the game.  </p>
<p>When she regained her senses she began once more to try to find a way past his defenses.  With the score tied, the next hit would win and B'Elanna was determined to triumph.  They clashed several more times with neither of them able to score a blow.  B'Elanna was beginning to feel a bit desperate when he attacked once more stronger than before; he had fooled her with his tactics just as easily as she had him.  She summoned up all of her strength and began to hack away at him as if her were a tree she was trying to fell in the forest.  Her technique was completely gone and all she had left was her strength and conditioning. He parried her blows for some time, but always falling back before the fury of her thrusts.  She brought a crushing overhead swing down onto the edge of his blade, very near the hilt and couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the sword fall from his hand.  She quickly tapped him on the shoulder with the flat of her blade and the match and championship were hers.</p>
<p>The older man was shaking his head in disbelief that he had just been bested by a slip of a man who obviously only played at soldiers during the tournament season.  Yet he had to admit the man had been unrelenting and skillful in his attacks.  When fancy tournament techniques had failed the smaller man had relied on strength and will to win the battle.  He picked up his sword with a hand still numb from the last blow, and saluted the young Lord respectfully before leaving the sword ring to seek solace in a pint of beer.  Harry and the others were beside themselves with elation as B'Elanna made her way over to them through a throng of well wishers.  Her helmet was badly dented and it took Harry a few moments to undo the buckles.  Annika would not rest until she had thoroughly examined her wife to be certain she was not seriously hurt.  She had been terrified when she saw the dark knight land the crushing blow to her love's head, and it was some time before her heart slowed down even after she saw for herself that B'Elanna was fine.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's first joust the next day was not until the afternoon so the entire group made their way into the city to the pub that was favoured by the tournament crowd and they had dinner and many pints of ale that night before they made their way back to the tents. It was always fun for B'Elanna to be among the soldiers and to take part in their rough teasing and humour.  Annika was content to sit back and watch Lord Beyla with his friends.  She knew that B'Elanna needed this time to herself to really savour her victory with others who would understand what she had been through in the ring this afternoon.  For Sarah it was a revelation to watch the woman she knew as B'Elanna become the rough warrior Lord Beyla.  Even though she knew B'Elanna was really a woman she had a hard time believing it as she watched her drink and boast with the other warriors.</p>
<p>The next day was rainy and cold, but the tournament continued regardless of the weather.  As a group they decided not to attend any of the other events in this weather and so they remained in the tent for the morning, chatting and telling stories to pass the time.  B'Elanna finally heard the story of how Harry and Sarah had met as they traveled the countryside to take care of preparations for Annika's and B'Elanna's wedding.  Sarah had B'Elanna laughing until tears ran down her cheeks when she spoke of how awkward and shy Harry had been after he discovered that he was attracted to her.  Harry had stammered so badly that she thought he was telling her that he was telling her he admired her carrots rather than her character.  Later, when she sensed him standing close behind her she had turned to look at him and her cheek collided with his nose giving him a terrible nosebleed.  Harry blushed furiously as his secrets were revealed.  When B'Elanna started teasing him about his apparent addiction to carrots he retaliated by telling the story of their fireside dance lessons.  Annika couldn't resist joining in and describing B'Elanna's bumbling behaviour at the first banquet.  The little family laughed the dreary morning away and when they emerged from the tent to prepare for B'Elanna's first joust none of them even noticed the rain.</p>
<p>The joust was slightly less of challenge for B'Elanna than the sword competition had been, as jousting was almost solely a tournament sport and not used in battle.  Only their strength and the training of their horses gave the soldiers an advantage.  B'Elanna and Goliath had no problem overcoming the slippery conditions and they easily won the two matches they fought that afternoon.  Tom took Goliath back to the stables and washed him and his barding thoroughly before putting him up for the night.  </p>
<p>"You have certainly outdone yourself today my love.  I don't think I've ever seen you quite so dirty," Annika teased as she unbuckled B'Elanna's armour.</p>
<p>"I work all day to earn a living for you and this is the thanks I get?you nag me over a little bit of dirt."</p>
<p>"A little bit?I find it hard to believe that there is any dirt left in the jousting arena judging by the amount you seem to have accumulated on your clothes."</p>
<p>"Well, a little mud never hurt anyone," B'Elanna said as she attempted to pull Annika into her filthy arms.</p>
<p>"Oh no you don't?you stay away from me," Annika cried as she twisted away from B'Elanna's hands.</p>
<p>"Only a few days of marriage and already you are rejecting my affections.  My friends warned me this would happen."</p>
<p>"And you'll be sleeping with your friends this evening if you get me dirty do you hear me," Annika squealed.</p>
<p>B'Elanna ignored Annika's warning and grabbed her into her arms.  The mud from her armour was smeared all over Annika's dress.  Annika continued to mock struggle for several more minutes before she relented and allowed her wife to claim her lips. Their hands became desperate as they struggled to remove the barrier of cloth and steel that stood between them and the skin they so longed to touch.  When they finally removed the last of the obstacles they sank down on the bed and traced trails of fire over one another's skin with fingers and lips aflame with desire.  Annika reveled in the feeling of B'Elanna's fingers deep inside of her and she felt her hips rocking hard into her lover's hands as she struggled to meld herself with her warrior love.  </p>
<p>When their need for one another was sated they lay together stroking and caressing, enjoying their closeness. Annika looked down at the streaks of mud all over her skin, transferred there from B'Elanna's hands and clothing.  She had never in her life been this dirty; she smiled when she thought of what her parents would say if they ever saw her like this.  A smile that deepened when she realized that it didn't matter what others thought, only how wonderful she felt when she was with B'Elanna like this.</p>
<p>"You are carrying the water for my bath tonight my knight in filthy armour," she teased, "AND you are washing my clothes.</p>
<p>"Yes dear," B'Elanna replied with mock subservience.  Despite the teasing nature of the conversation B'Elanna got to her feet and dressed quickly to begin to heat the water for their baths.  Once they were both cleaned up and their clothing washed B'Elanna and Annika joined the others in town for dinner in the tavern.  They held hands and teased one another like teenagers as they walked.  Neither of them could imagine being happier, and yet once they were surrounded by family and friends they found that they were.</p>
<p>The next day was rainy and cold as well, and B'Elanna had only a few contests, which she easily won.  Once again she found that she would participating in the joust final on the last day of the tournament.  They spent the day with friends watching some of the other contests and had an early evening in preparation for the finals.</p>
<p>The last day of the tournament dawned bright and sunny.  It was a welcome change from the dreary wetness of the past few days.  B'Elanna oiled and cleaned her armour to be ready for her competition and was at the lists an hour before she was scheduled to enter.  She watched the other knights as they competed for a spot opposite her in the final and she was not surprised to see that the dark knight she had fought in the sword ring was among the finalists.  He unhorsed his last two opponents with unerring blows to the chest and as he rode past where she waited he nodded at her in acknowledgment of the fact that they would once again face one another for all of the honours.  B'Elanna knew that he would be looking to win at any cost to make up for his defeat at her hands in the sword ring and she knew that it would require everything she had to give if she were to be victorious today.</p>
<p>She heard the crowd chanting her name as the herald announced the participants for the finals. She entered the lists and acknowledged the cheers as her opponent readied himself for the first tilt.  She felt her stomach tighten as she watched the man across from her.  His horse was larger even than Goliath and having felt the strength in his arm she knew she was in for the fight of her life.  The starter walked to the centre of the rail and raised the flag.  B'Elanna's entire world became the sight of that flag and when it was dropped she dug her heels into Goliath's flanks and they burst into the ring. She lowered her lance and sighted in on her opponent's shoulder; her concentration in moments like this was absolutely complete.  Nothing else existed as she bore down on him.  She could hear nothing but the beating of her own heart as the target grew larger and closer before her eyes.  She thrust forward with her body and lance and felt the tip strike his armour at the same instant she felt the hammer blow of his lance as it shattered on her chest.  It wasn't the hardest hit she had ever taken but it still took her several minutes to regain her breath.  She circled back to where Harry stood and grabbed hold of her second lance.  She watched while the young boys scrambled under the barriers to scoop up the splinters of the lances they broke as souvenirs.  She looked across the arena and was gratified to see her opponent with his visor up and appearing as if he too were having trouble catching his breath.</p>
<p>The starter was once again in the middle of the arena and she snapped her visor into place and prepared for the next round.  The roar of the crowd was immense as the flag dropped and Goliath reared up, taking two huge leaps on his rear legs before leaping forward into his charge.  B'Elanna once again sighted her lance onto the dark knight's chest and prepared for the impact.  Once again she felt her lance connect just seconds before her world exploded.  His lance caught her right in the centre of chest like a hammer to an anvil.  She was thrown backward onto Goliath's flanks, and only his smooth gait stopped her from sliding senselessly to the ground.  Annika started to her feet, her hand over her mouth to stifle her cry of horror as she saw her wife nearly unhorsed before her eyes.  As much as it would hurt B'Elanna to lose the match it would kill her to lose the animal that was more than just a mount to her, but rather more akin to a friend.  </p>
<p>Harry was at her side in an instant, holding her in place on Goliath's back and trying to ascertain if she were still conscious or not.  He got her visor open and was relieved to see that she was still breathing and that her eyes were open.  He splashed water onto her face in an attempt to revive her.  After a few moments she seemed to snap back into the real world.  He got her take a drink of water and asked some simple questions like the name of her horse to determine that she was alert enough to continue.  The judge gave them the warning that their time was up and that B'Elanna had to make another pass or forfeit the match.  She grabbed the lance from Harry's hand.</p>
<p>"The match is tied Beyla," he advised, "you're going to have to unhorse him or strike him on the helmet in order to win.  You just can't keep taking this kind of punishment or he'll wear you down and win, and maybe take your horse in the process."</p>
<p>"I don't think I can unhorse him Harry, he's just too strong."</p>
<p>"Then don't play his game.  If you can't outmuscle him, out finesse him.  A blow to the helmet will win if he doesn't unhorse you or strike your helmet in return.  I don't think he has that kind aim Beyla.  You can do this."</p>
<p>"It's a risky proposition Harry."</p>
<p>"I believe in you.  You can do this."  </p>
<p>The starter was in place and he dropped the flag just as B'Elanna fixed her helmet in place.  She charged ahead her mind racing with the possibilities open to her.  She sighted the lance in on her opponent's chest, hoping to make the hit and stay alive; at the last moment she remembered Harry's words and raised the tip of the lance, thrusting it forward into the helmet of the dark knight.  </p>
<p>The crowd came to its feet with a roar as B'Elanna's lance tore the helmet off the head of her opponent.  She hit him a fraction of a second before his lance would have slammed into her chest and it knocked his aim off so that his lance merely broke on her shoulder.  The hit to the helmet put her ahead however and she was the champion of the King's own tournament. When she turned around to see the result of her blow she saw the knight slumped over the neck of his mount while his squire tried to rouse him.  She was relieved when he finally sat up and took a drink from the water skin his squire handed to him.  </p>
<p>Annika pushed her way through the crowd, much less afraid of contact with the mass of strangers than she used to be; she even used her elbows to good effect as she made her way through the masses of people between her and her wife. She was in such a hurry that she even ducked under the barrier around the ring so that she could make her way over to where B'Elanna was standing with Harry.  Once again her heart did not stop racing until she had assured herself that her wife had suffered no lasting damage after the brutal match.  </p>
<p>Since the jousting finals were the last event of the tournament there was not much time before the awards ceremony.  She wiped the sweat from B'Elanna's forehead while Harry loosened her armour as they waited for the workers to finish assembling the dais where the King would stand when he made his presentations to the winners.  </p>
<p>The heralds blew the royal salute announcing that the King was making his way onto the platform.  B'Elanna was trembling with nerves at the thought of actually standing before the monarch.  She forced herself to remain calm as she lined up with the other event winners.  As overall tournament champion she would be presented with her prize last and so she had time to watch King Henry as he congratulated the winners of his tournament, all of whom save B'Elanna were soldiers from his regiments.  He took the time to speak to each of them and still before she knew it he was standing in front of her.  She swept a low bow and kept her eyes respectfully down while he presented her with her winnings and congratulated her on her superb performance.  The awards over, he stood back and made his closing remarks and then the trumpets blew pronouncing the ceremony finished.  B'Elanna was about to make her way back over to her friends when she felt a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"May we have a word with you Lord Beyla?"</p>
<p>She turned to find herself facing not only the dark Knight but also the King of England.  She nodded wordlessly and followed them out of the arena.</p>
