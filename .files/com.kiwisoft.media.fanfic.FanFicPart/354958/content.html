<!-- The Western Chronicles \ 24: An Old Friend -->

<p>The next month on the road was rather uneventful, no more
		accidents and Josie managed to apprehend two more men on her list.</p>

		<p>"How much longer before we reach Deadwood?" Rebecca
		asked as she kicked up dust with her boots.</p>

		<p>"At least four more hours. Think of the nice hot bath you
		can have once we get there." She wiped the sweat from her brow with her already
		soaked bandanna.</p>

		<p>"Are you sure it's safe there? What if someone recognizes
		you?" She let the concern show plainly in her green eyes. Josie's lip twitched into a
		small grin.</p>

		<p>"Trust me, Rebecca. The codgers that live in Deadwood aren't
		worried about me." Her blue eyes stared off into the distance as her mind relived
		memories of her last trip to the mining town. She was so lost in thought that she didn't
		hear Rebecca's next question. "Huh?"</p>

		<p>"I said..." her voice conveyed her annoyance at her
		words being ignored...again. "If they're not worried about you, then who are they
		worried about?"</p>

		<p>"You'll see," Josie answered with a knowing smirk.
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The outlaw's eyes scanned from one side of the street to the
		other, noting every building and possible ambush point. "That isn't right."
		</p>

		<p>"What?" Rebecca asked. Josie's gaze settled on one
		building.</p>

		<p>"The assayer's office is closed," she said as she
		climbed down from the buckboard.</p>

		<p>"So? Maybe he drank too much laudanum."</p>

		<p>"No. This is a mining town, Rebecca. Even if the regular
		assayer were sick, there would be someone else to take his place. Look around...do you see
		anyone? It's the middle of the day...where is everyone?" Josie's hand lowered to her
		side, her thumb resting on the hammer of her Colt. She put her hand on Rebecca's shoulder.
		"Listen to me. I want you to be quiet and stay right behind me. If I start shooting,
		I want you to get on Phoenix and get out of here as fast as you can." She shook
		Rebecca's shoulder for emphasis. "Do you understand me?" She waited until the
		smaller woman nodded. "Good. Let's go."</p>

		<p>They entered the dim saloon and headed for the bar. "Whiskey
		and a sarsaparilla", Josie said as her eyes moved about the room.</p>

		<p>"Four bits," the gruff looking man behind the bar said
		as he sized up the well-armed woman. The outlaw gave him a dirty look as she fished out
		two quarters.</p>

		<p>"Where is everyone?"</p>

		<p>"Dead, mostly. Those that ain't will prob'ly be there
		soon."</p>

		<p>"What happened?" Rebecca asked, drawing a look from
		Josie. The barkeep set the drinks down, placing the whiskey in front of the more dangerous
		looking of the two.</p>

		<p>"Mostly 'cause a them damn injuns. Savages always attacking
		us." He took an involuntary step back when he saw the tall woman's eyes narrow at
		him. Rebecca gave him a similar look, though not as effective, before placing her small
		hand on the outlaw's forearm. The touch was enough to break through and keep Josie's anger
		in check.</p>

		<p>"Just tell me where I can find Jane," Josie said
		through gritted teeth. Every part of her body wanted to reach over the bar and grab him by
		the throat. She dimly realized that it was only because Rebecca was standing next to her
		that she didn't act on her impulses.</p>

		<p>"Sure, sure," he said as he put his hands up in a
		placating gesture. "She's at the boarding house. Only place big enough to hold all of
		'em."</p>

		<p>Josie allowed herself one more withering gaze at him before
		turning. "Let's go." She didn't look to see if the young woman followed her.
		Once outside, she jumped onto the seat of the buckboard and slapped the reins against the
		horse's rump even before Rebecca was seated, nearly pitching her from the wagon.</p>

		<p>"Josie, are you all right?" She didn't miss the
		whiteness of the outlaw's knuckles as she held the reins in a death grip.</p>

		<p>"The boarding house must be that big one at the end of the
		street," Josie said, refusing to meet Rebecca's gaze. She wasn't ready to let go of
		her anger.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." Rebecca said as she covered Josie's hand
		with her own. "He's just ignorant. Come on, let's go find your friend." The
		outlaw nodded slightly as she released a deep breath.</p>

		<p>They entered the boarding house and were both shocked at what
		they saw. The parlor held no furniture, the floor covered with sick and injured people.
		Several men still had arrows sticking out of their bodies. Josie reached behind her back
		and retrieved the small knife from its secret place in her belt. The blue eyes quickly
		assessed the situation. She looked around for someone healthy enough to help her move some
		of the patients. Josie spotted a young man, close to Rebecca's age, kneeling next to one
		of the sick women. "You, come here and help." He looked up at her but made no
		effort to move. She glared at him and spoke in a tone that brooked no argument. "We
		need to separate the sick from the injured and start treating them. You don't look like
		you're sick or injured..." she lowered her tone to a growl, "...so get to
		it."</p>

		<p>"B-but my mother...what would she think if I left her alone
		at a time like this?"</p>

		<p>"What do you think your mother would say if you sat there
		and made no effort to help others?" Rebecca asked in a tone that filled him with
		guilt. He bent down and gave his mother a kiss on her sweaty forehead.</p>

		<p>"I'll be back soon, mother."</p>

		<p>He rose and moved over toward them. "My name is Michael.
		What can I do to help?"</p>

		<p>Josie moved over and knelt next to a man with an arrow sticking
		out of his upper chest. She carefully removed his shirt while giving instructions.
		"Rebecca, get as many clean rags as you can. Tear some into long strips. Get water
		and throw a poker in the fire. Michael, I need you to hold him still while I push the
		arrow through." The young man swallowed and grimaced as he grabbed hold of the
		injured man's shoulder. "Okay, now I'm going to rotate him onto his side." As
		she did, she thought how grateful she was that the man was unconscious. She hoped he was
		out enough not to feel the pain. She wasn't that lucky. He woke and let out a
		bloodcurdling scream when she pushed the arrow through and broke off the point. Rebecca
		ran over and knelt at his head.</p>

		<p>"What's your name?" she asked as she stroked his
		temples.</p>

		<p>"W-William." His voice was hoarse from screaming.
		</p>

		<p>"My name is Rebecca. That's my friend Josie and that's
		Michael. We're here to help you, okay? Now, I want you to lie back and let me tell you a
		story."</p>

		<p>"It hurts," he gasped. Josie rose to check on the
		poker.</p>

		<p>"Shh, it's okay. I know it hurts," Rebecca spoke in
		soothing tones, encouraging William to relax. "There once was a beautiful young
		woman....", she continued to weave her tale, completely hypnotizing both him and
		Michael. Josie reached down and, in one fluid motion, grabbed the shaft and pulled it from
		the man's body. Rebecca had been watching the outlaw and had her hands on William's
		shoulders just as Josie reached down. William screamed and continued to scream as Josie
		cauterized the entry and exit wounds before he mercifully passed out from the pain.
		</p>

		<p>"Now just what in tarnation is going on down here?" The
		voice was female, albeit a bit deep, but Rebecca would have sworn she was looking at a
		man. Short dark hair framed a slightly rounded face, weathered from years of hard living
		and harder drinking. The woman focused on Josie. "You! Damn, I thought you was dead,
		killed back there with your gang."</p>

		<p>"Henry and Jonah aren't dead, Jane, neither am I."
		Josie rose and gestured at the young blonde woman. "This is my friend Rebecca.
		Rebecca, this is Martha Jane Canary, better known as Calamity Jane."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca and Michael struggled to move the sick people upstairs
		while Josie and Jane tended to the injured people downstairs.</p>

		<p>"Are you the only one caring for all these people?"
		Josie asked as she continued to stitch up a nasty gash in her patient's abdomen. Jane
		removed a small flask from her belt and took a long pull. "I do what I can. It seems
		like there's more sick and injured every day. I can't keep up with 'em all.", she
		held out the flask. Seeing the shake of the outlaw's head, she said, "Suit yerself.
		You go help someone else, I've got this one."</p>

		<p>Josie nodded and moved off to tend to another man felled by
		arrows. This time the wound was mortal and she knew it. The outlaw found she couldn't meet
		the young man's eyes as she passed by him in search of someone she could help.</p>

		<p>Rebecca and Michael worked together trying to cool down the
		feverish patients or warm up the ones suffering from chills. "Michael, do you know
		what these hard red lumps are?" she asked, pointing to a rash of rapidly forming
		lumps on the victim's arm.</p>

		<p>"No," he said as he shook his head. "I've never
		seen anything like that before." He rubbed his temples. "Ah, I wish there was
		some laudanum. I swear it feels like there's a herd of cattle stampeding in my head."
		His hands moved to completely cover his temples as he fell to his knees.</p>

		<p>"Michael!" Rebecca exclaimed as she knelt by his side.
		</p>

		<p>"It hurts, oh it hurts," he cried as tears started to
		leak out from his tightly shut lids. Rebecca moved his hands out of the way and started to
		gently massage his temples. She moved her thumbs down to massage his upper neck, relieving
		the tension as she hummed a gentle melody.</p>

		<p>"Just relax and think of a time when you were happy. Close
		your eyes and think of that time. Tell me about that time."</p>

		<p>"I was ten, back when we stilled lived in Virginia. Papa had
		just bought me a horse of my very own," he smiled and leaned back against Rebecca's
		chest. She continued to massage his temples. "I was a small boy. I couldn't get up in
		the saddle."</p>

		<p>"I know that feeling," she said with a laugh in her
		voice. "I'm sorry, go on."</p>

		<p>"You have a beautiful voice, Rebecca. It goes well with your
		beautiful face." They exchanged soft smiles of nervousness. "What was I...oh,
		the horse. I couldn't get up on my own. I remember papa coming over and lifting me up in
		his arms to put me on the saddle. I never felt more safe, or more loved."</p>

		<p>"That's a very sweet story," Rebecca said looking down
		at him. Michael's head was now resting in her lap. She noticed beads of perspiration on
		his forehead. "You're warm," she said with concern in her voice. "I mean
		really warm. I'll get Josie."</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I'm fine." He forced himself into a sitting
		position, facing her. "Why don't you go see if Josie needs anything and I'll get back
		to looking after these people."</p>

		<p>Josie put her to work cleaning soiled rags and blood-soaked
		knives. Rebecca estimated there must be at least twenty men with wounds from fighting and
		thirty men and women who were sick. She had seen at least a dozen of them upstairs while
		she was looking for rags. Many of them had the hard red lumps on their arms and legs. Some
		complained to her of pain, and she shared what laudanum they had with the ones who seemed
		to be in the most pain until there was none left. After that all she could do was provide
		them with a gentle touch and a soft voice for a few moments of peace. The young woman was
		so exhausted by the time Josie found a place for them to lay down that she fell asleep
		immediately, not even taking the time to ask the outlaw about the skin rashes.</p>

		<p>Josie removed her gun belts and lay down next to the sleeping
		form. It wasn't long before she too was asleep. For the first time in almost a month, she
		was blessed with no nightmares. The gunslinger's dreams were filled with peaceful visions
		of her life when she was young, just before the war between the states broke out. Swirling
		images of her mother and her friends sitting in the parlor, speaking of great changes
		coming, and of laughter and warmth, of love and safety. Josie smiled in her sleep and
		remained that way all night long.</p>

		<p>The next three days were spent in much the same fashion. Soldiers
		from the nearby fort started to pour in with various arrow and hatchet wounds from their
		raids on the Indians. Rebecca and Michael continued to care for the rapidly worsening sick
		people while Josie tended to the wounded. Jane alternated between the two floors, doing
		her best to calm and comfort as many as she could. She realized that the young girl and
		man didn't know that the people they were treating were suffering from smallpox. The
		sharpshooter deliberately kept the information from Josie as well. She needed all the help
		she could get and it was too late to protect them from the contagious disease now. Either
		they got it or they didn't. With all the wounded soldiers coming in, it was easy to keep
		the outlaw busy downstairs. At night, both Josie and Rebecca were too tired to sit up and
		talk. They merely curled up in their corner of the room and slept. Neither woman had
		really spoken to the other since they first arrived. Rebecca spent most of her time
		upstairs with the sick while the outlaw still hadn't made it up there yet.</p>

		<p>Carrying two cups of coffee, Rebecca made her way over to where
		Michael was standing, staring out the window. She placed a gentle hand on his shoulder.
		"Michael? Are you all right?"</p>

		<p>He turned his tear-streaked face to see her. "Oh Rebecca.
		It's Mother...she, she..." He broke into sobs as he pressed his face against her and
		wrapped his arms around her in a fierce embrace. Rebecca set the mugs down on the nearby
		windowsill and guided him to the floor. She rocked him in her arms as he desperately
		sought comfort from the pain in his heart. She noted that his forehead still felt like it
		was on fire. Rebecca took one of his hands in hers and took a good look at it. Multitudes
		of the bright red lumps were forming on his wrist and lower arm.</p>

		<p>Rebecca went downstairs and found Josie changing a soldier's
		bandages. "Josie, I need to talk to you." She waited until the bandages were
		changed and led the outlaw outside.</p>

		<p>"What's going on?" Josie didn't like the concerned look
		on her young friend's face. Rebecca looked downward, feeling guilty for not telling her
		sooner.</p>

		<p>"Josie, the sick people upstairs...they've got something
		contagious."</p>

		<p>The outlaw bounded up the stairs two at a time, glad that Rebecca
		was behind her and unable to see the stricken look on her face. Her worst fears were
		confirmed when she saw Michael crying over the dead body of his mother. His bare arms
		clearly showed the signs of the pox. She put her arm out to stop Rebecca from entering the
		room. "No."</p>

		<p>"Josie, I have to check on Michael," she said as she
		tried to move past the outlaw.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, it's too dangerous," Josie said as she
		grabbed both of the young woman's upper arms. "Don't you understand? It's smallpox,
		Rebecca." Her grip relaxed when she saw the shocked expression on her friend's face.
		</p>

		<p>"No.?" She looked up at Josie with disbelief.
		"But Michael, he's so young."</p>

		<p>"Smallpox doesn't care how old you are, Rebecca." She
		allowed a brief flash of concern to cross her normally stoic face as she pressed her hand
		against the young woman's face. "How do you feel?"</p>

		<p>Rebecca smiled at the gesture. "I'm fine, Josie. Look, if I
		was going to get it, I would have it already," she said, feigning a confidence she
		didn't feel. They looked at each other seriously, their eyes conveying the unspoken fear.
		</p>

		<p>Josie, Rebecca, and Jane sat around a small kitchen table.
		"Why didn't you say anything, Jane?" the outlaw asked with a tone that expressed
		her disapproval.</p>

		<p>"By the time I realized you were here, you both had already
		been exposed to it. T'wernt nothing I could've done 'bout it," she said, settling
		back and rolling herself a cigarette. "You see what I'm up against. Half those men
		would've been dead if you hadn't stayed to help. And that little girl of yours was a big
		comfort to them as well. She's a real huckleberry above a persimmon," Rebecca smiled
		at the compliment from the sharpshooter. Jane noted to herself that it seemed so odd that
		an angel like that was riding around with her old partner in crime. Josie was not one to
		ride with people whenever possible, and certainly not with such a fresh-faced young woman.
		</p>

		<p>"Rebecca has a way with words." Her blue eyes turned to
		capture the young woman's gaze. "She has a...calming effect on people. It's a rare
		quality." She turned back to her old friend. "You should have told me,
		Jane."</p>

		<p>"There's nothing we can do about it now, Josie,"
		Rebecca said as she rose from the table. "I'm going to go check on Michael," she
		said, holding up a hand to block the outlaw's protest. "Josie, he's all alone and he
		needs me. I'll be fine."</p>

		<p>"Josie, I'm sorry," Jane said as she poured them both
		another cup of coffee. "She's a beautiful girl. I'm sure she'll be fine."
		</p>

		<p>"I hope so. Ugh, Jane, stop trying to kill me with your
		coffin varnish," she said as she took a swallow of the overcooked coffee.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie went upstairs two hours later to fetch Rebecca for bed.
		With the influx of sick and injured, they could both use the extra rest. Opening the door
		to the large room, she was surprised to see how many people were there. She had assumed
		that there had been only a dozen or so people up there. A quick mental count of the dead
		that had been brought down made her think that there were only a few remaining. She now
		realized that there were close to a dozen still there. Pulling her bandanna up over her
		nose and mouth, she entered.</p>

		<p>Rebecca was kneeling next to Michael's bed holding his hand
		within hers. Josie stood back and leaned against a post, close enough to hear but not
		close enough to be noticed.</p>

		<p>"...and the rabbit slipped into the hole and escaped from
		the hungry wolf," she finished her story and ran a wet cloth across his burning
		forehead. "How was that?"</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Rebecca," he said as he reached up and
		touched her cheek with his fingertips. "You're a very beautiful creature. I'm
		sorry."</p>

		<p>"Shh, you need to rest now." She moved a lock of his
		dark hair away from his eyes. "Everything will be fine, just have faith."
		</p>

		<p>"No..." he gasped. "I know, Rebecca. I know what's
		wrong with me."</p>

		<p>"Then you also know that you need to rest. You can survive
		this, you know." She maintained her low, soft tones as she tried to lull him back
		into sleep. He brought his free hand up and grabbed her wrist.</p>

		<p>"Don't leave me, Rebecca. Please...stay and tell me another
		story."</p>

		<p>Josie closed the door behind her quietly. She swallowed and
		closed her eyes as she thought about how hard his death was going to be on her young
		friend. A small voice in the back of her mind asked her if she could handle losing
		Rebecca. Josie pushed the thought out of her head and purposefully headed down the stairs
		to their sleeping area. Knowing that thoughts of a peaceful sleep were hopeless, she
		turned and went to check on the patients.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca never left his side as the high fever gave way to
		delusional ranting and the night chills left him a helpless shell of the once vibrant
		young man. She stayed there telling her stories or quietly holding his hand. The red pox
		marks now covered his entire body, signaling just how close the end really was.</p>

		<p>"Rebecca, I...I can't see...everything's black," he
		cried, his voice hoarse and low. The strength he used to move patients was now all gone,
		taken by the vicious disease. Tears streamed down the sides of his face; she brushed them
		away with her fingers.</p>

		<p>"It's okay, Michael. Just rest now. It's going to be
		okay." Her voice cracked as she choked on the truth that she could no longer ignore.
		</p>

		<p>"I know, Rebecca," he said as he reached up with a
		shaky hand to touch her face. "So beautiful. I'm so sorry, Rebecca...so sorry."
		His hand fell onto his now still chest.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Through blinding tears, Rebecca ran downstairs and into Josie's
		arms. The young woman sobbed hysterically against the outlaw's chest. "Why?" she
		cried over and over, as her tears soaked the cotton shirt. Unsure of what to say, Josie
		remained quiet, tentatively stroking the blonde hair in a comforting motion. Jane walked
		over to them with a cup of tea for Rebecca to drink.</p>

		<p>"It'll calm her down," the sharpshooter said as she
		handed the mug to Josie. It took some convincing to get the upset girl to drink the strong
		liquid. It wasn't long before her tears abated and she started yawning.</p>

		<p>"What was in that?" Josie asked later, after they had
		gotten Rebecca to sleep and removed Michael's body. Jane handed her a mug of coffee before
		taking a swig from her flask.</p>

		<p>"'Nuff laudanum to make her sleep through the night, is
		all," she said as she scratched herself. "What's a purty young thing like that
		hanging 'round with you fer, anyway?"</p>

		<p>"What are you doing playing nursemaid to a bunch of
		miners?" Josie returned, ignoring the question.</p>

		<p>"Someone has to," she quipped. "'Sides, you've
		knew I was always purty good at caring for people." Jane leaned back and put her
		booted foot upon the table. "What I don't git is why you ain't robbin' 'n lootin' no
		more."</p>

		<p>"She depends on me," Josie said, nodding toward
		Rebecca.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"There's no going back, ya know. Once you git a price on yer
		head, it'll always be there. Taint nothin' gonna change that," she said before taking
		another long pull on her flask. "Them bounty hunters don't care none that you
		changed, they just care 'bout <img src="/media/files/com.kiwisoft.media.fanfic.FanFicPart/354958/calamity1.gif" alt="Calamity Jane" align="right" width="226" height="384"/>the money they been promised." Josie was just about to tell Jane that
		she had joined the ranks of the bounty hunters herself, when their conversation was
		interrupted by a low moan that was unmistakably Rebecca's. Josie leapt from her seat and
		headed over to her. The sweaty, flushed complexion struck fear into the outlaw's heart.
		Pushing the sweat soaked hair off of the young woman's forehead Josie felt the burning
		heat of fever. "Jane...Jane!" she yelled.</p>

		<p>The next three days were a blur to Josie. Every moment was spent
		at Rebecca's bedside, placing cool cloths across her body in a feeble attempt to break the
		raging fever.</p>

		<p>"We have to get the chickens into the coop before the
		coyotes get them," Rebecca mumbled. Josie removed the cloth from the young woman's
		forehead and dipped it in the bowl of now tepid water. It was the second time in an hour
		that Rebecca's fever had completely dried out the cloth.</p>

		<p>"I already took care of the chickens, Rebecca. You just rest
		now," she said as she placed the cloth back on the young woman's forehead. The
		incoherent ramblings had started that morning and only served to heighten Josie's sense of
		dread. She knew that the fever was just as likely to kill her friend as the infection from
		the blistering lumps that were now beginning to appear on her extremities.</p>

		<p>"Josie, you can't do nothin' for her, ya know. Either it
		kills her or it don't, ain't nothin' you can do 'bout it," Jane said
		as she placed another bucket of water next to her.</p>

		<p>"We'll see about that," the outlaw said as she soaked
		several cloths in the fresh water, only slightly cooler than the previous bucket. Jane
		shook her head and walked away, never seeing the stricken look on Josie's face as she
		reapplied the wet cloths.</p>

		<p>"Hang in there, Rebecca. Just hang in there."</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Rebecca's temperature rose steadily during the night until it
		reached a dangerous level. Her lips moved, but all that came out was non-sensible mumbles.
		The reddish lumps were spreading from her arms and legs to the rest of her body. Many of
		the wounded were moved out of the boarding house as soon as they were able, leaving only a
		dozen people for Jane to nurse. Josie left Rebecca's side only to use the outhouse. She
		even slept on the floor next to the stricken girl's bed, refusing to leave her alone for
		longer than necessary.</p>

		<p>Josie's paramount concern was trying to find a way to break
		Rebecca's fever before it was too late. The wet cloths made almost no difference except
		perhaps to make the outlaw feel like she was doing something. Rebecca was too incoherent
		to be aware of her surroundings. Dawn was just breaking over the horizon when Josie rose
		to look out the window. The rest of the boarding house was still asleep, but her concern
		for her young friend kept her up all night. Rebecca's temperature hadn't gone up for
		hours, but it hadn't gone down either. Leaning her forehead against the cool glass, Josie
		closed her eyes and tried to think of a way to get her friend's temperature down.</p>

		<p>"Jane! Jane, wake up!" she said as she shook the
		sharpshooter.</p>

		<p>Instantly Calamity brought her fist up and was caught by Josie's
		quick reflexes.</p>

		<p>"What in the hell do you think yer doin'?" the groggy
		woman cursed as she sat up and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I need a large wagon and some strong mules."</p>

		<p>"Wagon? Mules? Now just hold on a minute, what are you
		talkin' about?"</p>

		<p>"Ice. We need ice to bring Rebecca's fever down. The wagon
		can't come into town because of the quarantine so I have to go get the ice." She
		grabbed Jane's arm and pulled her from the bed. It was only Calamity's understanding of
		Josie's desperation to save her friend that kept her from reaching for her guns. 'When
		this is over, one way or another, we're gonna talk about waking Martha Jane Canary up from
		a sound sleep,' she told herself as she jerked her arm away and reached for her britches.
		</p>

		<p>"Josie, how're you gonna get past the army? 'Taint no way
		you're gonna get through with a wagon and mule."</p>

		<p>"I'll just have to find a way," she said firmly.
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>It was easier said than done, she realized when she finally got a
		look at the sentries placed a safe distance from the town. Josie knew they had orders to
		kill anyone who tried to leave before the quarantine was lifted. She knew she could slip
		in and out without being detected, but there was no way she could get a wagon through. She
		rubbed her biceps unconsciously before disappearing into a nearby thicket.</p>

		<p>Once she moved past the sentries, it was no problem to follow the
		road up hill to the icehouse. Her mental clock and the position of the sun told her that
		it had taken just over six hours for her to walk up the steep mountainside road to notice
		a cooling in temperature. Josie knew she couldn't be far. Her legs ached from the long
		journey and she groaned inwardly at the thought of going back with an extra fifty pounds
		of ice on her back.</p>

		<p>Being careful not to be noticed, Josie slipped into a storage
		shed and removed a large set of ice thongs and two saddle blankets. She folded one into
		thirds and tucked part of it up under her collar, letting the rest lay against her back.
		After folding the other blanket into thirds and then rolling it up, she grabbed the thongs
		and headed for the icehouse. Worried about how much ice would melt on the way down the
		mountain, Josie grabbed the biggest block she felt she could heft onto her back. After
		covering it with the second blanket, she jabbed the ice thongs into it. Bending down and
		turning around, she leaned the block of ice against the blanket on her back and pushed up
		with her legs. It took a moment for her to get her balance and then only by bending over
		slightly. Making certain that she wasn't spotted, Josie left the icehouse and started back
		down the mountain.</p>

		<p>She had been right in assuming that the cool air and the blankets
		would help maintain the life of the ice block, but she hadn't been right about one blanket
		being enough protection for her back from the cold. At least twice an hour Josie had to
		stop and not only rest her aching arms, but also to let her back warm up again. Several
		times she contemplated breaking the block down to a smaller size. The vision of her best
		friend, her only true friend, burning up with an uncontrollable fever filled her with a
		sense of guilt over her selfishness. Rebecca would need every piece of ice she could get
		in order to hopefully break her fever. With a grunt, Josie hefted the block onto her back
		again and continued her slow walk.</p>

		<p>Halfway down her burning legs, aching back, and screaming arms
		demanded a longer rest than a few minutes. Knowing that if she pushed herself too far she
		would never make it, Josie set the block down and leaned up against a tree. Looking at
		nothing in particular, the blue eyes came to rest upon the moonbeam bouncing off a willow
		tree. Leaning her head back and closing her eyes, Josie tried to remember what the old
		medicine woman had told her about willow trees. She looked again at the tree. It was a
		white willow, the bark of which when ground into a tea was a natural fever reducer.
		Forcing herself to her feet, the outlaw walked over to the tree. Pulling a knife out of
		her boot, Josie gouged out several long strips of bark and placed them in various pockets.
		With renewed hope, she jerked the block onto her back and set out again.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The sound of a boot kicking repeatedly at the door woke Jane up
		from her sound sleep. Cursing loudly, she cocked her Colt and opened the door. "Put
		her in the tub," Josie said as she took two steps inside and let the heavy block fall
		to the ground. Her fingers remained curled up from being held in such a tight grip for so
		long. With painful slowness she forced them to straighten. She didn't even try to hide the
		look of anguish on her face when she straightened up and tried to move her fingers. The
		first thing she did when she finally felt the feeling return was to reach into her pocket
		and pull out a piece of the bark. "I need to grind this down and make a tea out of
		it. It'll help bring her fever down." She pulled more pieces out of her pockets, and
		the sharpshooter reached out and took them from her.</p>

		<p>"I'll take care of this. You go sit down before you fall
		down," Jane said as she guided Josie to a nearby chair. "It's gonna take me a
		few minutes to git her into the tub and git the ice in there. You sit there for now."
		Josie had no choice but to flop down in the chair. Her legs felt like oak trees and she
		knew she had no strength left. Exhausted by the trek as well as the lack of sleep, it took
		only seconds for her eyes to close and slumber to take her.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie woke less than an hour later, the ache in her back cutting
		through her sleep. It took a moment for her completely exhausted senses to remember what
		was going on. With slow movements and a deep groan, she trudged off to check on Rebecca.
		</p>

		<p>"Yup. This should bring that fever down in no time,"
		the sharpshooter said as she added a few more pieces of ice into the water. "Just got
		her in there. Took a while to get the water and then haul that block in here. Had ta drag
		it. Tarnation woman, that block would break a mule's back. You daffy?"</p>

		<p>"We needed as much ice as we could get," Josie said as
		she knelt down next to the tub. "How ya doin?" she said softly as she dropped
		the pieces of ice that Jane was breaking off and giving her into the water. Rebecca's
		eyelids fluttered, but never opened. She seemed to be too weak to perform even that simple
		task. Once there was enough ice in the water to start it cooling down, Josie lowered
		Rebecca's head back until just her nose and mouth were above water. She placed towels
		under the young woman's head to keep it at that level while she moved the water about with
		her hand, forcing it to circulate around Rebecca's overheated body. Jane handed Josie the
		tall mug of tea made from the ground up bark.</p>

		<p>Josie nodded and took the mug. She dipped part of a clean cloth
		into the tea before bringing the fabric to Rebecca's lips. Parting them with her fingers,
		Josie squeezed the cloth, allowing a few drops at a time to fall into the young woman's
		mouth. As hoped, her body unconsciously swallowed. Ignoring the ache in her back and
		fingers, Josie continued to drip the tea into Rebecca's mouth until it was all gone.
		</p>

		<p>As the minutes ticked by, Josie continued her quiet vigil,
		removing water and adding ice when necessary, and constantly keeping the water flowing
		around in a clockwise motion. Her fingers were completely pruned from the lengthy
		immersion. The lack of sleep was catching up with Josie as she fought to keep her eyes
		open. The repetitive motion of churning the water didn't help; nor did her refusal to look
		at anything other than Rebecca's face, desperately hoping that it would look anything
		except so flushed.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Jane checked in on them an hour later to find the outlaw sleeping
		on the floor next to the tub. She noted that at some point extra towels had been placed in
		the tub to support and brace the young woman's head. It was as if Josie knew she would
		fall asleep and still tried to take care of Rebecca. Jane checked the water temperature,
		then placed her hand on the young woman's forehead. Turning her hand over, she checked
		both of the blonde woman's cheeks before checking her forehead again. "Cooler,"
		she said softly as she broke into a rare smile. "You did it, Josie," she said to
		the sleeping woman on the floor. "You broke her fever. The ice worked." She
		reached into the tub and lifted the small woman out. "I don't know how you did it,
		child, but if you only knew how much that woman went through for you. You just made a
		person who's killed more people 'n me go through hell 'n back to save you."</p>

		<p>Josie woke to find herself lying next to Rebecca in Jane's large
		bed. She quickly looked around for her gun, disoriented. "Relax, Josie," Jane's
		voice called out from the darkened shadows of dusk. The oil lamp was burning low on the
		table next to the bed, but it cast enough light for the sharpshooter to see Josie reach
		over to check on Rebecca. "She's fine...at least the fever broke anyway." Jane
		watched as the outlaw ran the backs of her fingers over the young woman's cheeks.
		"She woke up earlier fer a few minutes. Saw you there and fell back asleep."
		Jane quieted down when she realized that Josie was paying no attention to her.</p>

		<p>"You did it, didn't you?" she whispered as she gave
		Rebecca a soft kiss on the forehead. "You fought it and you beat it." Josie
		pulled her into her aching arms and held her close. "It's going to be fine now,
		everything will be fine."</p>

		<p>Jane quietly extinguished the lamp and closed the door behind
		her, leaving the sleeping women to their dreams.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Morning found Rebecca awake and alert and itching like crazy. The
		fever had given way to the second phase of smallpox, the burning, painful blisters that
		spread from the extremities to the rest of the body. Their extreme itchiness often made
		victims scratch themselves to the point of bleeding, increasing their chances for severe
		infections, which just as often killed the victims as the fever. By the time Josie entered
		with breakfast and tea, the young woman had scratched her left forearm raw and was
		starting on the right one. "What are you doing?" She growled as she set the tray
		down and grabbed Rebecca's wrists to stop her. "Rebecca, you know better than
		that," Josie said as she looked down at the red, irritated skin. Some spots were
		starting to bleed from the intense clawing. Josie sighed. "Look, I know it itches,
		but you have to keep from scratching. It'll only get worse." With that admonition she
		released Rebecca's wrists.</p>

		<p>"I know..." she said in a small voice. "But it
		itches so much." Her green eyes held Josie with a look of pain and discomfort.
		Rebecca started to rub the underside of her left wrist against her knee, covertly trying
		to scratch without being caught.</p>

		<p>"No!" Josie said, reaching out and grabbing the young
		woman's wrists again. Inside, Josie's heart was overflowing with compassion for her young
		friend's pain and irritation, but she knew the chance of scarring and infection were
		significantly decreased if Rebecca didn't scratch the blisters open.</p>

		<p>"They itch and they hurt," she cried as she tried to
		pull her arms away from the much stronger woman. "Josie, please, I can't take
		it..." Her words broke into sobs as she tried again to wrench her wrists out of the
		outlaw's grasp. The desperation in her green eyes to scratch equaled the determination in
		Josie's blue ones not to let her.</p>

		<p>"I know it's hard, but you have to fight it," she said
		in a gentle voice.</p>

		<p>"I can't." Rebecca cried as the tears streamed down her
		face. Not knowing what else to do, Josie pulled the young woman into her arms and held
		her. Within seconds, she felt Rebecca's arms moving against her back and quickly realized
		what she was up to. She again grabbed the young woman's wrists.</p>

		<p>"Jane!" She called out and waited for the sharpshooter
		to enter the room. "I need two wide strips of cloth, try and find the softest
		material you can." Josie watched as Rebecca's eyes grew wide at the realization of
		what was about to happen.</p>

		<p>"Josie...no...please." The stream of tears increased
		along with her struggle to free herself. "You can't do this, you just can't."
		</p>

		<p>The gunslinger's heart lurched at the impassioned plea, filling
		her with guilt for causing the hysterical tears. Jane returned with two wide strips of
		cloth that appeared to come from an old sheet. Together they held the struggling Rebecca
		down and tied her wrists securely to the bed frame. A tantrum ensued as the young woman
		flailed her legs wildly in a feeble attempt to escape her confinement. One bare foot
		connected with the side of Calamity's face, the nail causing a slight scratch on her
		cheek. Josie held her breath and slowly moved her hand down to her sidearm, well aware of
		the sharpshooter's quick temper. To her surprise and relief, Jane merely wiped the small
		trickle of blood from her face and stepped out of range of the kicking legs. "Scrappy
		thing, ain't she?" she quipped, cutting through the momentary tension.</p>

		<p>"That she is," Josie replied, careful to avoid the
		green eyes that were blazing with anger and frustration.</p>

		<p>"Let...me...GO!" She continued her kicking, which did
		nothing more than fuel her frustration. "You can't do this to me, Josie." She
		pounded the bed with her feet. "You're nothing but an overgrown bully," she said
		kicking again. Jane took the opportunity to exit quietly, leaving the outlaw with her
		charge.</p>

		<p>"You're just going to wear yourself out with all that
		kicking," Josie said calmly, yet still keeping her distance from the flailing legs.
		</p>

		<p>"I don't care! You let me out of this..." She jerked
		her wrists against the restraints. "Josie, you know this isn't fair. I wouldn't make
		you suffer like this." She knew her words were hurting her friend, her best friend.
		But at the moment, all thoughts of kindness and compassion were gone, replaced with the
		burning desire to ease the painful prickling feeling in her arms and legs. The muscles in
		Josie's jaw tightened as she fought to remind herself that Rebecca was only lashing out
		because of the pain.</p>

		<p>"I'm going to find something to help with the itching. Until
		then you'll have to stay tied up."</p>

		<p>"Josie, please..." She stopped kicking and turned her
		green eyes to lock with the gunslinger's. Rebecca moved her right foot and used a toenail
		to scratch an itch on the back of her left leg. The movement was not unnoticed by Josie,
		who turned and left the room for a moment, only to return with two more strips of cloth.
		</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Rebecca. You give me no choice," she said
		as she approached the now frantically kicking woman. In her thrashing about, Rebecca never
		saw the misting in Josie's eyes as she tied the knots that would prevent her best friend
		from hurting herself more.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Josie stared at the reflection in the mirror. The large purpling
		spot on her jaw was still tender to the touch even hours after Rebecca's heel had
		connected with it. Using a clean cloth, she carefully tended to the scratches that dotted
		her face and arms from her young friend's frantic attempt to keep her legs free. 'You're
		loosing your touch, old girl," she muttered. She always prided herself on her
		alertness and her ability to stay out of harms way. With Rebecca she never saw the blow
		coming, a rare thing indeed for the experienced gunslinger. With a quiet sigh, she set the
		cloth down on the edge of the sink and left the boarding house, needing a few minutes
		alone to sort out her thoughts.</p>

		<p>Once outside, Josie sought the shelter of a small grove of trees
		on the edge of town. Her still recovering muscles groaned at her thought of climbing up
		into the branches and she relented, deciding instead to sit on the ground and lean her
		back up against the trunk of a tall deadwood tree. She closed her eyes, letting her mind
		go through the litany of ways to ease Rebecca's suffering. The most common treatment for
		the blisters was a paste made of sulfa drugs. Of course the apothecary's store had long
		ago run out of such drugs. Soaproot would help, but her searches of the riverbanks turned
		up no sign of the plant. Damn quarantine, she thought to herself. There wasn't enough time
		for her to slip out of town, go to Rapid City for the medicine, and still make it back to
		Deadwood in time to save Rebecca. Josie brought her strong fingers up to firmly rub her
		temples in a vain attempt to ward off the impending headache.</p>

		<p>Her keen hearing picked up the sound of a wagon approaching in
		the distance. Of course, with the amount of noise the wagon was making, anyone would have
		heard it. Josie listened carefully, picking out the various sounds. It was obviously a
		wooden wagon, based on sound of metal clanging against metal and wood. That sound was most
		likely pots and pans banging against the sides. The hoof beats indicated at least two
		large horses carrying a heavy load. Whatever it was it was worth investigating, she
		decided as she rose to her feet and took off in the direction of the sound. It took her
		only a few minutes to reach the road that ran past the town, now guarded by soldiers from
		the nearby fort.</p>

		<p>"This town is under quarantine. No one in or out. Turn
		around and head back to Rapid City," the soldier said as he approached the wagon, his
		attention on the portly man at the reins. Josie watched quietly from her vantage behind a
		nearby bush.</p>

		<p>"Ooh, a captive audience, how delightful," the driver
		said, his voice slightly higher than one would expect from a man with his girth. His face
		sported a short beard, the same dark color that his hair once was, now graying with age.
		"Look, I can help whatever is wrong with them. I have medicines and elixirs
		and...."</p>

		<p>"I said no one enters, by order of Governor Mellette,"
		the soldier said, bringing his rifle up against his body to make sure the man understood
		the meaning.</p>

		<p>"Oh...I see what you're saying. No one enters." He
		forced a laugh to cover his intensely growing fear. "Well then, I guess I'll just be
		off."</p>

		<p>A sound in the bushes caused both men to turn around. What they
		saw was Josie somersaulting through the air at them. Before the soldier could raise his
		rifle into firing position, her boots landed squarely against his chest. A quick blow to
		his temple from the butt of her gun sent him into blackness. She turned her attention back
		to the man on the wagon, who looked like he was either going to cry or faint with his
		fear.</p>

		<p>"Now, I don't have much here, miss...ah...I mean..."
		</p>

		<p>"Shut up," she snarled as she headed to the side of the
		wagon. This was obviously a patent medicine man, she thought to herself. It was a
		traveling show wagon, with doors on the side and back, with a fold up stage for
		performing. Most likely he had a dancer or juggler inside the wagon who would come out and
		perform in towns to draw the crowds before he made his appearance, hawking elixirs that
		were little more than alcohol and syrup. Removing one Colt from her holster, she aimed at
		the door. "Come on out," she said in her most intimidating voice. Without
		turning around, Josie pulled her other Colt out and shot the hand of the soldier, forcing
		him to drop the rifle that was trained on her. A young man and woman exited the wagon. The
		man looked to be in his early twenties, thin and gangly with extremely thinning blonde
		hair. His face bore more acne scars than Josie had ever seen before. The young woman, on
		the other hand, was quite the pleasant sight to look at. Her flaming red hair was tied up
		in a swirling bun on her head, her worn dress hugging her bosom, forcing it up to
		tantalize and distract. Josie was certain that this woman was little more than a traveling
		whore doubling as an assistant to the flimflam man.</p>

		<p>"P-please allow me to introduce myself," the bearded
		man said nervously as he stepped down from the wagon. "My name is Salvatore, but most
		people call me Sal. Do you perhaps have an ailment that requires my attention?" he
		asked in a hopeful tone.</p>

		<p>"Sulfa drugs, all you have."</p>

		<p>Sal laughed nervously and wrung his hands together. "I
		ah...I mean sulfa drugs are extremely costly, if you know what I mean...urumph!" He
		found himself being held by the throat, his body off the ground and pressed against the
		side of the wooden wagon with enough force to rattle the warped door.</p>

		<p>"Where?" she growled menacingly. She extended her arm
		and stepped back a bit, worried that the extremely terrified man would lose control of his
		bladder. Her biceps screamed at the strain, but her concern for Rebecca overrode the pain.
		</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>It took only a few minutes for Josie to look through the
		different elixirs and creams Sal had stored away in his wagon. She found four crates of
		soaproot and two jars of salve made from sulfa drugs along with several bottles of
		laudanum. The majority of the remaining bottles contained mixtures that were mostly syrup
		and alcohol - good for making someone forget what ails them, but not much else. It was
		obvious that he had just restocked his supplies recently. The gunslinger smiled at her
		good fortune. There was enough medicine here to care for all the victims still suffering
		at the boardinghouse.</p>

		<p>"But you can't just take all my medicine..." Sal
		protested as Josie climbed up and took the reins. He scrambled up next to her, terrified
		of her but just as terrified of One-Eyed Henry back in Rapid City, the man who loaned him
		the money to pay for the supplies. Death from this madwoman would be a comfort compared to
		what Henry would do to him if he didn't show up in three days with the money plus
		substantial interest.</p>

		<p>"If you and your friends haven't been exposed to smallpox
		before it would be a good idea to stay here."</p>

		<p>"Smallpox? Did you say smallpox? Well, why didn't you say
		so? Just wait a second." He climbed down and spoke quickly to his assistants before
		pulling a small tent and other camping supplies off of their various positions on the
		wagon and placing them on the ground. "My town suffered through the pox back in the
		fifties," Sal said as he climbed back into the seat. "Why do you think I wear a
		beard in the middle of July?" He pointed to several small pitted scars that were
		mostly hidden by his facial hair. "Here, Buttercup and Raven are a bit skittish with
		unfamiliar people," he said, taking the reins from the gunslinger. With a cluck of
		his tongue, they were off toward town. "They're just kids," he said once they
		were on the road into town, referring to his two companions.</p>

		<p>"They'll be fine out here for a few days. Billy's a bit of a
		Jonathan, what with his family coming from Delaware and all, but he knows enough to keep
		them alive for a few days." He noted the faraway look in Josie's eyes and asked, with
		genuine concern in his voice, "Someone you love got the pox?" He hoped he
		wouldn't end up with a bullet for his question.</p>

		<p>"There are a dozen people suffering from it right now. Most
		of the others have died," she said, her blue eyes never leaving the road before them,
		her senses working to pick up any sign of trouble. The key to saving Rebecca was in this
		wagon and she was going to defend it with her life if necessary. Sal figured out the
		unspoken answer and gave the rein a flick, sending the horses into a trot.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The now unusual sound of a wagon pulling up outside brought
		Calamity Jane to the door. Her heart leapt with joy at the sign of the patent medicine
		man's wagon. "We've got soaproot and some sulfa paste," Josie said as she swung
		her long legs and jumped down from the seat. Sal used the handles and carefully stepped
		down. Together, the three of them brought all the usable medicine inside. Sal left to tend
		to his horses.</p>

		<p>Using mortars and pestles, the women ground the soaproot into a
		fine powder. Although not as effective as the sulfa paste, the tuber would be enough to
		ease the painful itching and help to draw out some of the blisters. Jane went to tend the
		others while Josie took up residence next to Rebecca.</p>

		<p>"Howdy," she said groggily. Jane had given the young
		woman several doses of laudanum in an attempt, quite simply, to make her too drunk and
		doped to fight the restraints.</p>

		<p>"Howdy yourself," Josie answered softly as she examined
		the rash, which now had moved up the arms and legs to cover most of Rebecca's body. Her
		face was mottled with several small red marks. "I have some medicine to help
		you."</p>

		<p>Rebecca knew better than to ask Josie to untie her again. The
		pasty mix of soaproot and sulfa drugs was cool against her overheated skin. She closed her
		eyes and relaxed under the older woman's gentle treatment. Josie worked slowly, making
		sure to carefully cover every inch of Rebecca's body with the healing salve. "Josie,
		aren't you afraid of catching it?"</p>

		<p>Josie paused for a moment, remembering a time long ago. Her blue
		eyes took on a faraway look. "There was an outbreak of smallpox on the reservation.
		The disease was new to the Cherokee; they had no natural defense to it." Like
		alcohol, she thought ruefully. "Smallpox wiped out most of the people in my tribe. I
		was around it the whole time and never got sick. I guess I'm just immune to it." A
		momentary flash of pain crossed her face as she remembered all the sick and dying and her
		helplessness to do anything about it.</p>

		<p>"Josie..." the little blonde said, trying to bring her
		friend back to the present. "I'm sorry about earlier..." her gaze fell on the
		purple bruise on the gunslinger's cheek.</p>

		<p>"Don't worry about it, Rebecca," she smiled, trying to
		lighten the mood. "Just don't get the idea that you'll ever get away with it
		again." Josie held up a mock fist in jest. Both shared the rare playful mood for a
		few more moments while she finished applying the salve.</p>

		<p>Sal returned a short time later his arms burdened down with a
		crate full of items he felt would be helpful to the suffering people. Without hesitation,
		he followed Jane's directions and started to help out. He chatted amiably with the people,
		holding some hands and generally lifting the mood with his infectious smile and chatter.
		</p>

		<p>"Who is that?" Rebecca asked. "He looks like a
		used wagon salesman."</p>

		<p>"Actually, he's one of those traveling medicine men. He was
		kind enough to supply us with all this medicine," she allowed a tone of gratitude to
		filter into her voice. "I found him on the road."</p>

		<p>"How did you convince him to come into a town with
		smallpox?" she asked. Thinking better of it she added, "Never mind. I'm sure I
		don't want to know."</p>

		<p>Josie chuckled. "No, you probably don't. Why don't you try
		to rest for a while?" She adjusted the pillow and turned down the lamp next to the
		bed.</p>

		<p>"Josie, you need to rest too."</p>

		<p>"I will, Rebecca. I just need to check on the others first.
		I'll be back in a little bit."</p>

		<p>Having Rebecca tied to the four corners of the bed made it
		impossible for Josie to sleep next to her. She contemplated undoing the straps for the
		night, but realized that the general movements of sleep could rub the salve off the young
		woman's skin. With a sigh, Josie pulled the comforter off of the end of the bed and laid
		it out on the floor.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Although Josie used most of the sulfa paste to blend with the
		soaproot, she kept a small amount aside, using the concentrated form on Rebecca's face,
		determined to do her best to prevent her pretty young friend from being scarred severely
		from the pox. Her efforts paid off handsomely as the days wore on. The itching stopped and
		Rebecca was finally untied, much to everyone's relief. Despite her normally gentle nature,
		the words and phrases that she came up with were enough to make a harlot blush. Although
		Josie abhorred physical discipline, she was sorely tempted to throw her young friend over
		her knee several times for her sharp retorts and biting words. There was no doubt that
		Rebecca could match words with the best of them. The blisters scabbed over, but were
		showing little, if any, signs of scarring.</p>

		<p>Before Sal arrived with the medicine, less than one out of ten
		had survived the pox. Ten of the twelve remaining victims survived and thanks to the sulfa
		and soaproot, most came out of it with only a few mild scars. The only sign of scarring on
		Rebecca's face was a small spot below her jawbone, unnoticeable unless pointed out. Within
		two weeks, the quarantine was lifted and the boardinghouse was returned to its normal use.
		</p>

		<p>Rebecca and Josie escorted Sal to the stables. "I have to go
		see if Billy and Mary are still waiting for me," he forced a small laugh.
		"They've probably gone back to Rapid City."</p>

		<p>"They're waiting for you in Rapid City, Sal," Josie
		said as she stepped forward. "Go to the Horses Mouth Inn. It's been paid for, and so
		has your debt to One-Eyed Henry."</p>

		<p>"B-but how did you...?"</p>

		<p>"Sal, I've learned that Josie works in mysterious
		ways," Rebecca said as she put her arm around his shoulder. "It's better most of
		the time not to ask; just accept it." Josie smiled at her friend's insight into her
		character.</p>

		<p>"Well then, I thank you most kindly, Josie." He knew
		better than to comment on her reputation as a murdering thief and train robber. In spite
		of all the weapons and her usual menacing stare, Sal just couldn't see her in that light
		any more. He had watched over the last few days as Josie had stayed by her friend's
		bedside, keeping her company and constantly tending to her. Being a light sleeper, he had
		been awakened one night by the crystal voice of the gunslinger talking to the sleeping
		blonde. For an endless length of time, Josie spoke of hopes, dreams, and wishes that she
		dared not reveal in the light of day. He understood now that there was a special bond
		between the two women. Sal had assumed that it was the young woman who needed Josie, when
		in fact it was just the opposite.</p>
