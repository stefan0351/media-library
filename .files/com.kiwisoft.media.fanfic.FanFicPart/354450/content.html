<!-- A Connected Love \ Interlude: The time it takes -->

<p>The two fighters for good soon recognized that they couldn't live forever. Not with their powers. They would be killed sometime during their fight. So they decided to make sure that the powers they held could be given to the next life. To a new human that would be able to fight the dark side and keep them at bay to not allow them to take the mortal realm again.</p>
<p>But they soon found out that it wasn't as easy to give those powers to the next human in the line as they had hoped. They found out that it was much more difficult to give all the powers to two single humans to continue their fight than to split their powers up and give them to a group of humans. And then, when the time came, they would be able to focus the powers and give them to two humans who then would be able to prevent the big attack that hell had sworn to do. They had to find out how to do such a thing and then give the powers to the next.</p>
<p>It has then been decided that in every generation there will be a group of humans that would be able to receive and use parts of the gifts that those two had received from the Powers of Light. It has been decided that those would from then on fight the evil and push them back as long as possible and those humans were given the all the power that was needed to fulfill their destiny. And a conscience that would not let them turn to the dark side.</p>
<p>But hell would once strike again and the two fighters for the mortal realm knew that. They could even figure out when it would strike again. And they knew they had to prevent the Powers of Darkness to reenter this realm. But they also knew that there would be smaller fights to regain control over what the demons had lost. Fights that would not be won if the Warriors for that time weren't given enough power.</p>
<p>So they took advantage of that and decided to give the special fighters sometimes more power. The problem was that it was more difficult to summon the magic than to summon the strength.</p>
<p>And so it came that every 720 years a Sorcerer was born with more powers than normal and every 144 years a Warrior was born with more strength than normal. But due to the attack that all knew would come they needed more to fight it back.</p>
<p>Every 3600 years hell would be able to open a new entrance to the mortal realm and be able to enter it without any problems. And to avoid that, it was necessary to give the two fighters for that event the powers that the first two also had. It was the time when all the powers the mortal realm had were concentrated in those two fighters for the existence of the mortal realm. But it was necessary for that, that those two fighters fought together. It was the only hope this realm had.</p>
<p>And to make sure that those two would fight together the first Warrior and the first Sorceress asked the mortal realm to connect them so that the future fighters would be connected in the same way. It was a connection that could only be activated by love and would, once active, bond those two together for eternity, making their souls immortal and, as soon they gave the powers to the next generation, their body's would be the same. It was a gift that the mortal realm gave them. A gift they received for their holy duty. All those that managed to find the other and fall in love with them would be able to live forever.</p>
<p>Together.</p>
