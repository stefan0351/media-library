<!-- Moment by Moment \ 8. Revenge -->

<p>Now, how did that happen?</p>
<p>I swear, if you ask me, I have NO idea how Nicole Julian's medical
file from our freshman year got printed on the front page of the
Zapruter. Honestly...NO earthly idea whatsoever.</p>
<p>I mean, I'M not the one who posed as Nicole to get the file. Nope,
nosiree, not me.</p>
<p>Uh...yeah I did. OK, I'll admit THAT much.</p>
<p>But I'm not the newly reinstated editor of the school newspaper.
Nope, innocent over here.</p>
<p>Blonde and clueless, thank you.</p>
<p>OK, I just HAVE to read this thing again...it amuses me:</p>
<p>'According to sources close to the Zapruter, (i.e. Me...shhh)
Nicole Julian has a long and colorful sexual history. Now it isn't
the habit of this paper or this reporter to air the predatory sexual
habits of its readers but due to the shocking nature of the truth in
this case, serving the public interest overwhelms any ethical qualms
we might have.</p>
<p>Nicole Julian is a slut.</p>
<p>The truth is as plain and obvious as the black and white
paper you hold in your hands.</p>
<p>Medical files obtained by this paper through unnamed sources
shows Ms Julian's long history of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Think that it doesn't happen to the rich, powerful,
beautiful, and bitchy?</p>
<p>Read on:</p>
<p>In the span of four years, Ms Julian has been treated at least once
for:</p>
<p>- Pubic lice (crabs)<br>
- Chlamydia<br>
- Gonorrhea (although we will point out that this was an ORAL
infection, this time)<br>
- Three pregnancy scares<br>
- And a miscarriage.</p>
<p>Now, as stated earlier, it is not the practice of this paper to air
the dirty laundry of one of its readers but we feel that Nicole
Julian is a danger to the public at large.</p>
<p>As one of her former victims, I wish I had been better informed of
her sexual history.</p>
<p>If there is any doubt to the validity of these claims, one need only
to look at pages 2-6 where Ms Julian's full medical file is printed. </p>
<p>You can not deny the written word, as stated by medical fact.</p>
<p>So next time you think and STD can't happen to you, think about
Nicole Julian. Despite her money and popularity, it happens to her.</p>
<p>Repeatedly.</p>
<p>And by the way...I've tested clean.</p>
<p>Editor-in-chief<br>
Samantha McPherson</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sneaky, sneaky little Sammy included pictures of crabs,
medical explanation, treatments, and the file and x-rays on Nicole's
knee. You know, the one she blew out because she spent too much time
on them? Yeah, that effectively lost her her spot on the Glamazons
as of noon today. That brought me much glee. </p>
<p>And of course, Nicole much rage.</p>
<p>She's been stalking around the halls looking for Sam,
threatening to sue for liable and shit. Lily keeps chiming in
about 'First Amendment rights' and all that before ducking out of
Nicole's way. And the rest of the school population won't go NEAR
Nic. She is effectively, Typhoid Mary. And I think I heard someone
humming Matchbox Twenty's 'I've got a disease' when she walked by a
little while ago.</p>
<p>Heh heh. About time she got hers. I'm getting a wonderful perverse
sense of joy out of all this.</p>
<p>Then again, most of it WAS my idea. I'm just glad Sam went for it.</p>
<p>"Hey.¨ her voice suddenly sounds WAY too close to my right ear and I
think I must have just jumped 4 feet straight up. She wasn't there a
second ago, she was hiding in the Novak.</p>
<p>Her arms wrap around me and she holds me tight. I'm already halfway
to mush just hearing the purr of her voice, her touch finishes the
job.</p>
<p>Gah...</p>
<p>God, I'm hopeless.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to scare you.¨ she apologizes while nuzzling my hair.
Man, she does such things to my body with just the simplest of
touches.</p>
<p>"It's OK.¨ I assure her, leaning back into her somewhat. I sigh
happily. I can't help it. I'm in her arms, what more could I want?</p>
<p>"Brooke, I want to go home.¨ she states, her voice low and gravely.
It sends a chill straight down my spine and then between my legs.
Damn, I may have to go home just to change my clothes.</p>
<p>Have you any idea what my laundry basket has looked like for the past
two weeks since that night in bed?</p>
<p>Yeah, my clothes are always in the wash now.</p>
<p>Except my pajamas. I don't wear any. We haven't done anything more
than kiss and hold each other but I stopped dressing for bed at Sam's
request. She alternates between naked and tee shirt with boxers,
depending on her mood. Either is fine with me as long as she's there.</p>
<p>"I want to go home and hold you.¨ she murmurs making me shiver more.
There's something different in her voice. And undertone that's
making my insides quake.</p>
<p>"OK.¨ is all I can manage to respond.</p>
<p>GAH! She just licked the back of my neck and if she wasn't holding
me up I think I would have swooned.</p>
<p>"Maybe do a little more than just...hold you.¨ she teases. </p>
<p>Breathe, Brooke. In with the good air, out with the bad.</p>
<p>I turn around in her arms so that I can look her in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Sam...?¨ She blushes and looks at me both sheepishly and seductively
at the same time.</p>
<p>Don't ask. I don't know HOW she pulls that off.</p>
<p>She looks me directly in the eyes, no wavering or doubt written in
them at this moment.</p>
<p>"You, are not Nicole Julian.¨ she says firmly. "You are not going to
hurt me. I don't think you could even if you wanted to.¨</p>
<p>Which I don't.</p>
<p>"When you look at me, I see only love, compassion, desire,
friendship, and adoration. I don't see any ulterior motive behind
those beautiful blue-green eyes of yours. I feel safe with you,
Brooke. I feel loved.¨</p>
<p>"You are.¨ I hear myself whisper.</p>
<p>Damn was that out loud?</p>
<p>Judging by the million-watt smile she's shooting me, yes, it was
indeed out loud. Then again, if she's going to smile like that at me
when I say it, I'll say it a million times a day.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Brooke.¨</p>
<p>My knees just gave out. Thankfully Sammy caught me.</p>
<p>Head spinning...</p>
<p>"Never thought...¨ Hyperventilating. "You'd feel...same...say it...I...I...¨</p>
<p>She sits me down on the floor, mildly panicked. Well, no duh! I just went all
'Rainman' in her arms. </p>
<p>How romantic. Snarfle.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?¨ she asks concerned.</p>
<p>"Yeah.¨ Oh look, coherency. It's not just a vague notion. I look up
at her beautiful worried face. "Can we go home now?¨</p>
<p>She smiles that radiant Sam smile and nods.</p>
<p>"I'd like that, a lot.¨ she says. Her voice is all husky and I'm not
sure my legs are going to support me if she keeps talking like that.</p>
