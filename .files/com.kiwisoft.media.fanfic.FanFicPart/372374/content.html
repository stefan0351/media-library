<P>A.N. I am working on Missing and Missed and also another story called Valentine Void (which I'm really excited about) anyways I hope you guys like this one.</P><P>Disclaimer â€“ I own nothing</P><P>This is from Rite Rose Publishings</P><P><U>Closer When Dreaming</U></P><P>The very first night that I slept over at Miley's house I found out one of the cutest things about her. She talks in her sleep. Not just mumbles or occasional words, she would have full on soliloquies about subjects. That first night, we were eleven and she was talking about wigs. I mean literally she talked for a full ten minutes about how itchy they were and how she didn't like them. I thought it was really cute, I mean who dream talks about how itchy wigs are? Now, of course, I know that she is Hannah Montana and talking about how itchy wigs are is actually kind of relevant to her day to day life but back then I had no clue at all.</P><P>Every night is the same, she'll drift off to sleep and about half an hour later, she will give a deep sigh and she'll tighten her grip of whatever she's holding and start talking. Sometimes she's clearly upset about what she's talking about and I will see the tears falling from her eyes, other times she'll giggle because she finds it amusing but she never yells, she always talks softly as if she's subconsciously not wanting to wake herself up. The length of the sleep talk varies anywhere from a few seconds to up to half an hour and then, after she has finished whatever she's talking about that night she will give another deep sigh and then be peaceful and silent for the rest of the night.</P><P>This doesn't happen every night, I'd say there's probably a one in five chance of it happening, and what she talks about is usually something that is resting heavily on her mind.</P><P>You might ask why I'm so interested in how Miley Stewart talks in her sleep? Well the answer is quite simple ... I'm in love with her. I notice every single thing about her even before I realised I was in love with her I probably knew her better than even her Dad did but I didn't realise I loved her until we were fifteen. We were having a Friday night sleepover and we were both exhausted, especially Miley. We had been to a Hannah concert that night and Miley had been having such a great time that she did four encores, which was the most she had done since she had had the surgery on her throat. When we got back to Miley's she was asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow and I was about to fall asleep a little while later when I heard a deep sigh come Miley and I felt her hand grip the material just over my stomach of my vest top I had worn to bed. Miley always slept on the right side of the bed, on her front, facing towards me. I always slept on my back so sometimes we would gravitate towards each other in our sleep. I smiled as I felt the grip on my vest top and opened my eyes to look at Miley's face, knowing she was about to start sleep talking.</P><P>"<I>I can't keep this to myself, I can't it's too hard"</I> Miley began, causing me to frown slightly, tonight was obviously going to be a serious one, <I>"I'm so stupid, she'll never like me" </I>My eyes widened as she said this, did she really just say she? <I>"She's so perfect and when she smiles I just melt" </I>Ok so she definitely said she, I thought to myself, I wonder who it is? Miley being gay certainly didn't bother me, she was my best friend and I wanted her to be happy no matter who it was with. <I>"I wish I could just tell her, I wish I could walk into school and down the beach holding her hand in mine and I want to be able to kiss her whenever I want ... God I really want to kiss her" </I>Miley gave a quirky little half smile as she said this that I couldn't help but smile at too, she was adorable, <I>"I want to be able to comfort her as more than a friend when she's upset and I want to tell her that those ridiculous wigs in all those bright colours just bring out the beautiful blue of her eyes ..." </I>... Wait a second, I thought to myself, <I>"... I love you Lilly"</I> she whispered before giving another deep sigh indicating the sleep talk was over for the night.</P><P>I quickly turned my head to stare up at the ceiling and the cheap glow in the dark stars that I had convinced Miley to buy and stick on her ceiling and let out the breath I hadn't even realised I had been holding. She loves me? She wants to kiss me? Wow, kissing Miley ...</P><P>My eyes widened for the second time in the last five minutes as I realised that <I>I </I>wanted to kiss Miley as well, that I wanted to be able to hold her hand and be there for her all the time. I'm in love with Miley.</P><P>That night I lay there for good two or three hours, going over and over the situation in my head. My first thought was to wake her up and declare my undying love for her and tell her I'd never leave but as the time wore on I realised something. Miley never acted in any other manner than a friendly one when she was awake. She had never even brought up the topic of being gay with me, whether it was about her or others. I had no idea whether what she was saying in her dreams talks was what she really wanted and was aware of it or whether loving me was a subconscious desire. Was it possible for the dream talks she had to have double meanings like dreams did? Did this mean she really did love me like she said or not?</P><P>By the time I eventually fell asleep I had decided I would never broach the topic with Miley, if she brought it up then I would happily tell her how I felt but I could not act on the dream talks. That wasn't fair to Miley.</P><P>As the next two years passed, I began to long for our Friday night sleepovers and I always stayed awake after Miley had fallen to sleep to wait and see if she would dream talk. At first they would only happen every so often as before but before long they were happening every week and I began asking if we would have Saturday night sleepovers as well which she readily agreed to. At first I would lie there waiting to see if she would dream talk and then watch her as she said the most amazing beautiful things about me but as the months went by the things she said started to become bolder. On the night of her sixteenth birthday, not long after her first dream talk about me, she said some things that quite honestly I will not repeat for the sake of not embarrassing Miley, but let's just say I blushed ... a lot, at the things she said and I was squirmed for while before I was comfortable enough to go to sleep that night and my dreams were filled of images of the things she had described. When we woke up the next morning, I found that my arm had made its way around Miley's shoulders and she had curled into my side, her hand having slipped just underneath my vest top.</P><P>After that I began to realise that I was becoming addicted to the nights I spent at Miley's. I didn't care though because I love her so much. One night as I was waiting of her to start her dream talk, I was staring at her face and before I knew what was happening my hand reached forward and gently traced her jaw line and I saw Miley smile in her sleep. As the night progressed I found that if I traced her jaw line she would always smile, if I kissed her on the forehead she would lean her head on my shoulder so I could wrap my arm around her, if I gently stroked her hand it would find its way under my vest top (never her whole hand, just her fingers up to her knuckles) but the favourite thing I found out happened quite by accident, I had noticed that she was shivering slightly one night just after she had finished her dream talk so I pulled the blanket over us as well and then put my hand back under the covers to keep warm. We were so close already that my fingers grazed the outside of her thigh; I froze as she moaned lightly and then she moved so her leg had moved over mine to rest in between my legs and she cuddled impossibly closer to me. My eyes drifted shut in contentment as I was suddenly surrounded by Miley's warmth but then they shot open as Miley kissed my collarbone in her sleep.</P><P>Every night we had a sleepover after that, I would make sure to 'accidentally' graze the outside of her thigh with my hand and I always fell asleep in that comfortable position and we never mentioned it when we woke up like that. I did begin to feel a little guilty about the fact that I was basically <I>making</I> Miley cuddle into me but I just couldn't stop, just like I couldn't stop keeping myself awake long enough to hear the beautiful things she always said about me.</P><P>This brings me to our current moment in time. We are both eighteen now and we are due to move into an apartment together tomorrow. We are both going to UCLA and I was going to get student housing but Miley wouldn't hear of it "You're moving in with me" she had told me firmly, "Daddy says I can use some of the Hannah money to get us an apartment" she had grinned happily. Her Dad had already given her full control over the Hannah money on her eighteenth birthday but she had told him she still wanted him to manage it for her so whilst she did now have access to the fortune that was hers, she still talked it over with her Dad before she made a big purchase. Today we had packed up all our belongings at both houses and had fallen exhaustedly on Miley's bed. She had suggested having one last sleepover which I could not deny as we would not be sharing the same bed when we would be living together as of tomorrow so our sleepovers would never be the same. I was patiently waiting for Miley to start her sleep talking and she didn't disappoint. I smiled softly as she finished with <I>"I love you Lilly"</I> to which I couldn't help but whisper "I love you too Miley" and feeling bold I leant forward and placed a soft kiss on her lips before lying back and grazing her outer thigh causing her to cuddle into my side as usual. I sighed happily and as I fell asleep I had one final thought.</P><P><I>Maybe the walls will be thin and I'll still be able to hear her sleep talk</I>. I thought hopefully.</P><P>A.N. Let me know what you guys think :) thanks Nicki xoxo</P>
