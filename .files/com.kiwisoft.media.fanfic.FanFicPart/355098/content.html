<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 9 -->

<p>Sam woke the next day to find herself tightly pressed against Brooke?s naked body, being held securely in the lean cheerleader?s arms. Brooke was already awake, watching her intently with an odd look of peace and contentment on her face. Her hazel eyes seemed to be twinkling at Sam as Sam stared up into them.</p>
<p>"Good morning," the blonde whispered. She nuzzled Sam?s cheek with her nose as Sam woke up fully.</p>
<p>"Morning," Sam whispered back. She felt more relaxed than she had in ages, the constant yearning in her chest having subsided as she lay in Brooke?s arms. She thought about the things they?d done the night before and chuckled softly.</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke asked looking at her strangely. Sam smirked as she looked back at the blonde.</p>
<p>"I was calling your bluff," she said cryptically. Brooke frowned in confusion.</p>
<p>"I don?t understand?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday, when I went into the bathroom. I went in there to call your bluff. I still didn?t believe what you said; that you loved me and I was angry. I went in there to confront you to see how far I could push it," Sam explained. Brooke?s face fell and a look of utter hurt flashed across her face. She closed her eyes to stop the tears from falling.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said quietly.</p>
<p>"But then I saw your face, Brooke," Sam added hastily, seeing that her words had hurt Brooke and not wanting any misunderstanding. Brooke opened her eyes again which were glassy from unshed tears. Sam reached up and stroked Brooke?s cheek with her fingertips.</p>
<p>"I saw your face and I realized that it wasn?t a game, Brooke. That you weren?t acting out some hideous plot hatched by Nicole and Mary Cherry to destroy me at school. In your eyes I saw that your feelings were real. And I was lost," Sam finished explaining. The tears of pain that Brooke was trying to fight turned to joy and spilled down her face.</p>
<p>"You believe me?" she whispered to Sam. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Of course I do," Sam assured her, brushing away Brooke?s tears gently with her thumbs. "When you kissed me and I did my super freak out routine, I reacted that way because I thought you were lying. It was everything I wanted. YOU are everything I want and I thought somehow you found out and were mocking me. I was scared and hurt and I panicked. I?m sorry."</p>
<p>"It?s OK, Sammy. As long as you know now that I?m sincere. I love you, Sam. I have for a long time. Even before our parents got together," Brooke informed her. Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"Me too. That long. I?ve loved you for that long too, Brooke." She leaned up and seized Brooke?s lips in a burning, passionate kiss hoping to convey everything she felt through her lips. The kiss left them both breathless. Brooke let her hands drift over Sam?s back, scoring the skin slightly with her fingernails. She felt Sam moan against her.</p>
<p>"God, you drive me crazy," Sam groaned. Brooke giggled slightly.</p>
<p>"Same here, Sammy," she admitted as Sam?s teeth grazed her collarbone. "I hate to?uhm?er?interrupt," Brooke?s voice caught and dipped in octave as Sam continued. "But where do we go from here?"</p>
<p>"I don?t know," Sam murmured lowly against Brooke?s flesh. "And honestly, now that I have you I don?t really care. I?m not letting go." Brooke ran her fingers through Sam?s hair.</p>
<p>"I don?t want you to, Sammy," she gasped.</p>
<p>"Good then, we?re agreed," Sam joked as she continued moving lower. Brooke arched against her. "Easy, baby," she soothed as Brooke whimpered involuntarily. "Whatever else happens, we?ll deal with it. I love you."</p>
<p>"I love you too," Brooke managed to respond. Again words failed them as they became lost in each other for the remainder of the day.</p>
