<!-- Son of Sam \ Part 4: Talk About Wanting -->

<p>Sam and Brooke were sitting in Sam's bed working on their history paper together and listening to music. Actually, Brooke was trying to work on her history paper while Sam was busy nibbling on the cheerleader's earlobe. Brooke tried to push Sam away gently pointing at her book. However, Sam didn't care for the blonde's indications. She kissed her neck, moving down to her shoulders and finally her collarbone. Brooke smiled as she felt her whole body soften at the touch of her girlfriend. When she felt a strong tingle starting deep inside her stomach moving down to her crotch, she reckoned it was time to stop before she was all lost in Pleasureville.</p>
<p>"Sam", she whined, "stop that! You know we have to get this done." The cheerleader realized she didn't sound so convincing since Sam continued kissing her, now slowly moving her hands over her tummy, giving her goose bumps in strange places.</p>
<p>Brooke put down the book and settled down resting on her elbows so she was lying face to face with the brunette.</p>
<p>"You know Sam, I've been thinking."</p>
<p>"Did it hurt?" Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"Ha-Ha really funny Sam. But seriously; I've been thinking about that in vitro fertilization thing."</p>
<p>"I thought it freaked you out."</p>
<p>"Yeah it did, sort of. It reminded me of that time I thought I was pregnant by Josh. I was so scared and confused and just wanted it all to go away. And now, I would do anything to have your baby."</p>
<p>"You want to have my baby?" Sam laughed not really believing what she just had heard.</p>
<p>Brooke frowned, confused. That last statement she had said without thinking. However, after further consideration, it made a whole lot of sense. Even if she knew that it was practically impossible for them two to breed, something inside her longed for it.</p>
<p>"Don't you think we are a bit too young to be thinking about kids Brooke?"</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged. "The fact that we are to women does not really make the reproducing part of our relationship very simple."</p>
<p>"Don't ya mean reproduct?" Sam asked mimicking Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"You know what I mean Sam. Don't you want to have kids some day?"</p>
<p>"I don't know Brooke..." Sam noticed that the blonde in front of her got a sad expression on her face. "I mean, sure I would. I just don't see a reason to be thinking about that right know. Besides, I would rather see us making our dreams come true; become something; see the world and learn some languages... before we start thinking about the kid thing."</p>
<p>"I guess you're right." The blonde sighed. "But I think biology is calling out my name."</p>
<p>Sam gave her a questioning look. "I mean that I feel the urge to have a baby Sam. I would just love to have a little miniature version of you running around calling me mommy." The blonde said dreamingly.</p>
<p>"Mac looks kinda like me when I was a baby..." Sam trailed off as she saw something interesting in the magazine lying on the bed.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed. Clearly, Sam couldn't understand her and the sudden "touched-by-nature" feeling. On the other hand, maybe it wasn't nature. Maybe she wanted to have kids with Sam because she loved her more than life it self. That got Brooke a bit confused. Her whole life she had figured she would meet Mr. Right, marry him, have kids and live happily ever after. However, when she realized Sam was her Mr. Right, everything was turned up side down. She sometimes comfort her self by thinking that they at least didn't have to bother about eventually moving in together, since that bit had been taken care of even before they even got together romantically. This sometime was more a worry than a relief.</p>
<p>"Earth calling Brooke. Hello?" Brooke blinked and saw Sam looking at her with a stupid, yet so gorgeous grin on her face.</p>
<p>"Are you still here?" Sam teased.</p>
<p>"Shut up and kiss me you fool." Brooke whispered in a 50's drama queen style, gently pressing her body against the brunette's.</p>
<p>Sam did not hesitate to obey her girlfriend, kissing her passionately, slowly moving so Brooke finally was lying on top of her. As their kisses got more fiery and their breaths got more rapid and their hands just all over each other, Brooke (all dizzy from desire) fumbled with Sam's top for quite a while before Sam had to pull it of her self. Otherwise, the blonde had ripped the thing into small pieces.</p>
<p>Brooke stopped the kissing for a moment and looked at Sam's upper body. Her eyes traced the scars over the brunette's right chest, down to her ribs, ending at her tummy. She tried to figure out why Sam only had scars on the right side of her body, only to shake that though out of her head as it was killing the I-so-want-Sammy mood. The blonde placed feather light kisses following the line of scars up to Sam's chest. She was surprised Sam didn't whine and push her away. Usually, the brunette didn't appreciate when Brooke paid extra attention to the scars on her body.</p>
<p>As Brooke was kissing her way further up Sam's body in a voyage towards those pouty lips, she found her self face to face (well, kinda) with a small silver amulet with an even smaller light green stone in the middle. She stared at it for a moment before she looked up to meet Sam's questioning expression.</p>
<p>"What's this Sammy?" She asked pointing at the amulet.</p>
<p>"Oh I forgot to tell you!" The brunette replied cheerfully and sat her self up. "I got it from Lilly and Carmen today. They had been out shopping yesterday and found it at some antique shop. They said they had to buy it cause it was calling out my name."</p>
<p>"Aw, that so sweet."</p>
<p>"Actually, Carmen claims she literally heard the amulet call my name. But Lily just shrugged it of as a case of bad food poisoning."</p>
<p>Brooke smiled and brought Sam closer for a tender kiss, enjoying the feeling of the other girls' warm and soft lips. When their kisses got even fierier than last time, it was Sam's turn to brake the kissing, much to Brooke's disappointment.</p>
<p>"Princess, I do wish I could have your baby. I mean; if it was possible."</p>
<p>Brooke didn't comment on that, just brought the other girls as close as possible and continued with the heated kisses, caressing every inch of Sam's body with her hands. At that moment, she really wished she could make Sam's wishes come true. A little miracle never the less.</p>
