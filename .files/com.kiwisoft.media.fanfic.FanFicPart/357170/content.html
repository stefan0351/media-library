<!-- A Two Of A Kind Love \ Part 19: Obtaining Necessities-->

<p>Willow and Buffy were sitting at the desk in her room, looking at her laptop. In another minute or so, the maps and plans for City Hall would download onto the machine. They had been doing that most of the day, while the rest of the gang had other 'assignments'.</P>
<p>"Cordelia said the Mayor hasn't come out of the building all day. Faith came in, and has been there ever since." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Something's gonna happen. I can feel it."</P>
<p>"Well if Faith or the Mayor leave, we'll know."</P>
<p>"Who would have thought Cordelia's cell phone would be useful? Well, then again, Xander is with her, so their information could be less then accurate."</P>
<p>Willow smiled briefly, and shut her eyes. The computer screen was getting to her, and she just felt really stressed and tense. They had been sitting there for seven hours. It took two just to get into the city mainframe and another two and half just to get past the protection and encryption system. She grabbed the back of her neck, trying to work out the knots. </P>
<P>Buffy got behind Willow, and started to massage her neck, rubbing her fingers in slow, gentle circles.</P>
<p>"Ah!" Willow hissed feeling a bit of discomfort and then relief from Buffy's efforts. "That...feels...good."</P>
<p>"Wow. You are tense."</P>
<p>Willow felt extremely calm as she started to feel Buffy's massage paying off. For a few seconds she was quiet, enjoying it. Even the simplest form of physical contact seemed to be overpowering, and even though they hadn't been "intimate" since that night, they weren't frustrated. Besides, with everything going on lately there wasn't time. Well, not the length of time they both felt such an act and expression of love deserved, anyhow.	</P>
<p>Right now, Willow was more than content just to feel Buffy's fingers caressing the tension right out of her body. There were so many more facets to their relationship that went beyond physical expression, and were more important to maintain.</P>
<P>They felt truly free with themselves now, and all the jokes and innuendoes they had been exchanging were on the surface, just that. Innuendoes. And their ability to say those things without reservations, and total freedom, really showed that they had grown and felt comfortable with each other. That they had moved past all the bumps in the road. Willow never even thought an innuendo would leave her mouth a couple months ago. She really felt like she had grown a lot, and she had Buffy to thank for it. </P>
<P>Looking deeper though, what it really did, was kept up their connection as friends, because they never ever wanted to lose that. It also kept reminding them of how far they had come, and how wonderful it was, because they knew they were still going forward and growing even closer.</P>
<P>"Stress does not Willow help." Willow finally said, jumbling her words.</P>
<p>"It doesn't help your sentence structure either."</P>
<p>"No, I think that's your fault."</P>
<p>"Are you saying I'm a bad influence, Miss Rosenberg?"</P>
<p>"Of course not, Miss Summers. I'm blaming your talented fingers."</P>
<p>"They're only talented because they have a reason to be."</P>
<p>Willow craned her loosened neck, and looked up at Buffy. She pulled her head down and kissed her softly.</P>
<p>"I'm so lucky." They said together, already knowing what the other was going to say.</P>
<p>They laughed softly, and were broken out of their peace by the beeping of the laptop. Immediately snapping to attention, they looked at the maps onscreen.</P>
<p>"I'll send these to library, and Oz can print them out for Giles and Wesley. Then they can finish strategizing."</P>
<p>Willow pushed a few buttons, and wired the maps and plans directly to the library computer.</P>
<p>"We should get there." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Yeah, you're right." Willow shut down her computer, and they started to exit the room. </P>
<p>"You really think I have talented fingers, huh?"</P>
<p>"I know you do."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled at her, with a glint in her eyes. "Even when I do this?" She got her fingers poised.</P>
<p><I> 'Don't you dare.' </I> Willow said to her silently.</P>
<p>"Don't what? Do this?" Buffy asked, running towards Willow.</P>
<p>Willow ran out into the hall, with Buffy close behind. She ran down the steps, and nearly made it to the door, but Buffy grabbed her and started tickling her stomach.</P>
<p>"No fair!" Willow said, laughing.</P>
<p>Buffy held onto Willow with one hand, and opened the door with her other hand.</P>
<p>"It's worse if you struggle, you know."</P>
<p>When they got outside, Buffy put Willow down. Not even stopping to recover, Willow chased Buffy all the way to the library.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>At the airport, a small, two-seater plane came to a stop and a man exited, carrying a box. A vampire waited by a limo with a briefcase.</P>
<P>"Is he in the car?" The man asked.</P>
<P>"No, I'll take you to him."</P>
<P>The man kicked the limo door shut, that the vampire had held open for him. His hand was handcuffed to the box.</P>
<P>"The Mayor was supposed to be here in person with the money. Well, the price just went up. I don't like surprises."</P>
<p>An arrow quickly whizzed into the man's back from behind, killing him instantly. Faith jumped down from her hiding spot.</P>
<P>"Surprise." She said.</P>
<P>"You killed him." The vampire remarked, astonished.</P>
<P>"What are you, the narrator? Keys to the cuffs?"</P>
<P>The vampire searched the man's clothing.</P>
<P>"Nothing." Faith pulled out her new knife. "That won't cut through steel."</P>
<P>"No, but it will cut through bone."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"She left?" Buffy asked, approaching Cordelia's car that was sitting in the street in front of City Hall.</P>
<P>"About forty-five minutes -" Xander started, but then stopped as the limo came back. "And now she's here again."</P>
<P>"Get back to the library and help the others. I'll be there soon."</P>
<P>Cordelia started the car, and Xander hopped in the passenger seat. They drove off, leaving Buffy behind. She watched as Faith exited the limo carrying an old-looking box. Faith then entered the building.</P>
<P>The limo then pulled around to the parking lot. Buffy hurried to it, and punched in the driver's side window. The vampire driver was startled as she grabbed the front of his shirt.</P>
<P>"So, what's in the box?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the Mayor's Office, Faith set the box down on his desk.</P>
<P>"There it is! Ah, what happened to the courier? I was supposed to pay him."</P>
<P>"Made him an offer he couldn't survive."</P>
<P>"You are one heck of a girl, you know that? I mean geez, the initiative, the skill."</P>
<P>"Go on, go on." </P>
<P>"I will. You know, I'll tell you, if Buffy...if Buffy Summers walked in here and said she wanted to switch to our side, I'd say no thanks, sister, I've got all the Slayer one man could ever need." </P>
<P>Faith sighed.</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Nothing."</P>
<P>"Oh, it's cause I used the B-word, huh? Don't tell me you're still sore about her whole little band."</P>
<P>"No, I'm over it. She can have them."</P>
<P>"Better believe she can. You, on the other hand, can do better. I'm glad I found you when I did. You were wasting your talents with those demons on the streets. You'll always be appreciated here." </P>
<P>"I'm glad you found me too, boss."</P>
<P>She started fidgeting and began toying with the clasp of the box. He slammed his hands down on top of the box. "Don't do that."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"The Box of Gavrock." Buffy was telling everyone at the library. "It houses some great demonic energy or something which His Honor needs to chow down on come A-Day."</P>
<P>Willow brought over some sheets of paper, and laid them out on the table.</P>
<P>"Plans for City Hall that we downloaded. They were in the Water and Power mainframe." She said.</P>
<P>"The box is being kept under guard in a conference room on the top floor. Unfortunately, that's all I could get out of my informant before his aggressive tendencies forced me to introduce him to Mr. Pointy." Buffy said, pointing to the maps.</P>
<P>"Well, now, here's what I think we should do..." Wesley started.</P>
<P>"I figure we can enter through the skylight. I could use your help Giles."</P>
<p>"Of course."</P>
<P>"And there's a fire ladder on the east side of the building, here." Xander said, pointing.</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, fine, but we still need to consider whether the Mayor..." Wesley tried again.</P>
<P>"It won't be enough to simply have possession of the box." Giles said.</P>
<P>"Right, we have to destroy it. Not just physically - ritually, with some down and dirty black magic." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Hang on. We don't know what such a ritual would require." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"I think the Breath of the Atropyx is standard for this sort of thing. Fairly simple recipe. Xander?"</P>
<P>"I know. I'm ingredient getting guy."</P>
<P>"Alright, stop! I demand everyone stop this instant! I'm in charge here and I say this is all moving much too fast. We need time to fully analyze the situation and devise a proper and strategic stratagem."</P>
<P>"Wes, hop on the train or get off the tracks. You had your shot." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"The Mayor will most assuredly have supernatural safeguards protecting the box." There was silence. "Oh, we all forgot about that, did we?"</P>
<P>"Looks like a job for Wiccan girl. What do you say, Will? Big time danger."</P>
<P>"Hey, I eat danger for breakfast." Willow said confidently.</P>
<P>"But oddly enough, she panics in the face of breakfast foods." Xander quipped.</P>
<P>"Let's get to work." Buffy said, leading everyone out of the library.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Out front of City Hall, Wesley drove up in a dark van. Giles, Buffy and Willow got out.</P>
<P>"Now remember, if anything should go awry, Wesley, you must create a diversion." Giles said.</P>
<P>"Let's synchronize our watches. I have twenty-one four," Wesley said.</P>
<P>Buffy and Willow held up their bare wrists.</P>
<P>"Yes, typical."</P>
<P>"Maybe we could just count. One, one thousand; two, one thousand..." Willow said.</P>
<P>Buffy smiled at her, and the three of them walked off.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Back in the library, Oz placed a large ceramic pot on a pedestal, and Cordelia was looking at a sheet of paper. Xander entered carrying a paper bag.</P>
<P>"You got the goods?" Oz asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah. Essence of toad, twice-blessed sage…" He held up two different baggies. "Maybe that's the toad?"</P>
<P>"Well, we better be sure. Destroying this box is supposed to be a pretty delicate operation."</P>
<P>"Well, then, they shouldn't leave it in the hands of the lay people."</P>
<P>"Don't worry. Willow drew stick-figure instructions." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>Xander looked at the sheet. "Wow! She even drew that low-cut dress you like to wear."</P>
<P>"What's that supposed to mean?"</P>
<P>"How many dollar bills do you think you could fit in that thing?"</P>
<P>Cordelia looked furious.</P>
<P>"You both need large amounts of therapy. Toad me."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>On the roof, the three of them saw the box on the conference room table through the skylight. Giles opened the skylight, and Buffy handed Willow a book and a bottle containing sand. Willow read a spell while pouring the sand over the box. A blue force field appeared, and then vanished.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah, I'm bad."</P>
<P>"Four stars, Will. Now get going." Buffy said, smiling.</P>
<P>"I'm gone."</P>
<P>Willow left by the fire ladder, as Giles fit Buffy with a harness and set up a pulley system. He lowered her down over the box.</P>
<P>"Got it!" Buffy called.</P>
<P>As she lifted the box off the table, an alarm rang. Giles pulled on the cord, but Buffy didn't budge.</P>
<p>"Giles!"</P>
<P>"It's jammed."</P>
<P>"I'd like very much to come up now, please."</P>
<P>Two vampires entered the room.</P>
<P>"Don't suppose you want to help me get down." They growled. "Didn't think so."</P>
<P>Giles half jumped half fell, down to the table. Buffy did a kick using a vertical spin in the harness, kicking the two attackers down, and then got out of it. </P>
<P>Buffy helped Giles up, and he grabbed the box. They ran from the room with the vampires in pursuit. They got outside and darted right. As the vampires left the building after them, Wesley drove off, and they followed the van.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>  Later, in the wrecked conference room, the Mayor surveyed the damage while his vampire guards watched, ashamed.</P>
<P>"Well, this is very unfortunate. I just had this conference room redecorated, for Pete's sake. At taxpayers' expense. And, oh yeah..." He suddenly got a look of rage on his face, and smashed a chair. "They've got my box."</P>
<P>Faith walked in, holding a knife to Willow's neck. "Yeah they do, but looky what we got."</P>
<p>He smiled brightly.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"How did you guys let ...How did this happen?" Buffy asked a very sullen gang at the library.</P>
<p>"I thought…she was still," Wesley said slowly.</P>
<P>"They probably got her when she…" Cordelia trailed off.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry." Giles said, sympathetic.</P>
<P>"Look, it's nobody's fault, okay. We just need to focus and deal."</P>
<P>"We go back. Full-on assault." Xander said.</P>
<P>"They'll kill her." Giles said.</P>
<P>"We're assuming they haven't already?" Wesley asked.</P>
<P>"No. No, they know what she means to me…to us." Buffy closed her eyes, and tried to calm down. She needed to think. "She's too valuable as long as we still have the box. We trade."</P>
<P>"We can't."</P>
<P>"No, it's the safest plan." She looked from the disagreeing Wesley, to Giles. "It's the only way, right?"</P>
<P>"It might well be." Giles said.</P>
<P>"Look, we call the Mayor and arrange a meeting." </P>
<P>"This box must be destroyed." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"I need a volunteer to hit Wesley." Xander said.</P>
<P>"Giles, you know I'm right about this."</P>
<P>"Wes, you want to duck and cover at this point?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"Damn it, you listen to me! This box is the key to the Mayor's Ascension. Thousands of lives depend on our getting rid of it. Now I want to help Willow as much as the rest of you, but we will find another way."</P>
<P>"There is no other way."</P>
<P>"You and Willow were the ones who wanted to use this plan. You were right. This is the town's best hope of survival. I'm sure Willow knew the risks."</P>
<P>"You're gonna blame her getting captured on…are you made of human parts? You don't want to help her; you don't care about her. I do. We do. And I'm not sacrificing her for anything. Because if anything happens to her -"</P>
<P>"Alright! Let's deal with this rationally." Giles intervened.</P>
<P>"Why are you taking his side?"</P>
<P>Buffy looked at Oz who was sitting quietly over in the corner. He met her gaze, and nodded.</P>
<P>"You'd sacrifice thousands of lives instead? Your families, your friends?"</P>
<P>Oz got up, and walked over t   o the ceramic pot.</P>
<P>"It can all end right here. We have the means to destroy this box."</P>
<P>Oz picked up the pot and threw it into a display case, smashing it. </P>
<P>"Giles, make the phone call." Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In a storeroom in City Hall, Willow was banging on a locked window, trying to open it. She gave up on the window and pulled out a desk drawer. A vampire guard entered when he heard the noise.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?"</P>
<P>"Oh, uh, I'm looking for a sucking candy, cause my mouth gets dry when I'm nervous, or held prisoner against my will. " </P>
<P>He approached her, looking hungry. </P>
<P>"And suddenly I'm thinking sucking isn't a good word to use around vampires. Hey! Did you get permission to eat the hostage? I don't think so. You're going to be in some trouble when the Mayor..."</P>
<P>He grabbed her shoulders and pressed her against a wall. "Just a little taste."</P>
<P>As he leaned in to bite, Willow caused a pencil from the desk drawer to float up behind him and stab him in the back. He crumbled to dust.</P>
<P>  Willow left the room and started down a hallway. A door opened and she heard Faith and the Mayor. Willow quickly hid in another room and listened.</P>
<P>"She's not gonna be brain-dead, but she'd be to come back here tonight." Faith said.</P>
<P>"Ever had a dog?"</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"I did. Rusty. Irish setter. A dog's friendship is stronger than reason, stronger than its own sense of self-preservation. And boy, when it really loves something, it just won't let it go. Buffy's like a dog, and hey, before you can say Jack Robinson, you'll get to see me kill her like one."</P>
<P>Faith and the Mayor walked down the hall, and Willow started to run the other way, but stopped at the open door to the Mayor's office. She entered, closed the door, and found the Mayor's liquor cabinet that was full of skulls and black arts statues. She found a hidden compartment containing five books, and began skimming the pages.</P>
<P>"The Books of Ascension." She said, in awe.</P>
<P>"Check out the bookworm." Faith said, who was standing in the doorway.</P>
<P>"Faith!"</P>
<P>"Anyone with brains, anyone who knew what was going to happen to her, would try to claw her way out of this place. But you, you just can't stop Nancy Drew-ing, can you? Guess now you know too much and that kinda just naturally leads to killing."</P>
<P>"Faith, wait. I want to…talk to you."</P>
<p>"The last time we talked, you weren't too nice to me. I was hurt. And this time you don't have her here to protect you from me." She backhanded Willow to the ground. "Payback's a bitch, ain't it?"</P>
<P>"I'm not afraid of you."</P>
<P>Faith pulled out her special knife. "Let's see what we can do about that."</P>
<P>The Mayor was standing in the doorway.</P>
<P>"Girls, I hope I don't have to separate you two. Faith, you can play with your new toy later. Something's come up." </P>
<P>Faith still held the knife to Willow's neck, staring into her eyes.</P>
<P>"Faith! You know I don't like repeating myself." She backed off. "I just received a heck of an interesting phone call."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the cafeteria, the gang was waiting on the Mayor. Giles was holding a baseball bat, and Oz was checking to make sure a door was locked.</P>
<P>"The whole place is locked down, except for the front." He said.</P>
<P>"Yeah, it gives me that comforting trapped feeling." Xander said.</P>
<P>"One way out means one way in. I want to see them coming." Buffy said, alert.</P>
<I><P>'Why did I tell her to go in the first place? She should've stayed. If he hurt her I swear, I don't care if he is invincible, I'll…'</P>
</I><P>The lights went out, and only the outside lights shined in. </P>
<P>"Guess they're shy." Xander commented.</P>
<P>Two vampires pushed open the front doors, followed by the Mayor, then Faith, who was holding Willow. The two groups stopped and glared at each other. The Mayor and Buffy walked a bit away from their respective parties. </P>
<P>She exchanged glances with Willow. <I>'I'm okay.'</I> </P>
<P>"Well, this is exciting, isn't it?" The Mayor chuckled. "Clandestine meetings by dark of night. Exchange of prisoners. I just…I feel like we should all be wearing trenchcoats."</P>
<P>"Let her go."</P>
<P>"No. Not until the box is in my hands. So you're the little girl that's been causing me all this trouble." Buffy just continued to stare at him. "It really is wonderful how all of you are fighting, it truly is. Admirable even.</P>
<P>"I hate to rain on your parade, but when I get that box back…any future any of you might have had…well don't make any long range plans. You sure you want to give up the box?"</P>
<P>"I don't think we need to talk about this."</P>
<P>"God, you kids, you know. You don't like to think about the future. You don't like to make plans. Unless you want Faith to gut your friend like a sea bass, show a little respect for your elders."</P>
<P>"I'll earn my future. Don't worry about that. But I'm not gonna do it without her. So let's get going."</P>
<P>"Such drive. And that's really beautiful. It'll almost be a shame to kill you. Well, not quite. Make the trade."</P>
<P>Faith stepped up, and tossed Willow to Buffy, and Buffy handed her the box. Willow smiled at her, then got behind her.</P>
<P>"Well, that went smooth." The Mayor said.</P>
<P>Suddenly, Snyder and two policemen entered through the front door.</P>
<P>"Nobody moves!" He said, as the Mayor stepped into the shadows. "I knew you kids were up to something."</P>
<P>"Snyder, get out of here." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"You're not giving orders, young lady. I suppose you're going to tell me I won't find drugs in this box." He took the box from Faith, and she was getting ready to use her knife.</P>
<P>"Wait!" Buffy yelled.</P>
<P>The Mayor stepped forward. "Principal Snyder. I think we have a problem."</P>
<P>"Mr. Mayor, I had no idea you ... I'm terribly sorry."</P>
<P>"No, it's I who should apologize. Coming down here at night. What must you be thinking? But you see, I just needed to..." One of the policemen was opening the box. "No! Don't do that!"</P>
<P>A spider-like creature leapt out of the box and onto the policeman's face. He started screaming. He attempted to pull the spider off his face, but couldn't. He collapsed to the floor and stopped moving. The spider released him and went away into the shadows. They started looking for it.</P>
<P>"Oh God." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"Where did it go?" Xander asked, Cordelia clinging to him.</P>
<P>"Get that door open!" Snyder yelled.</P>
<P>"No! You can't let that thing out of here!" Giles said.</P>
<P>"I still want to know where it went."</P>
<P>"Listen." Buffy said.</P>
<P>They heard soft noises on the ceiling. The spider was moving quickly. Everyone looked up. The spider dropped onto the Mayor's face and he fell backwards onto a table.</P>
<P>"Boss!" Faith called running over to him, and yanking the spider off him. It ran off.</P>
<P>Giles and Wesley climbed up on chairs. While everyone was looking at the Mayor's rapidly healing wounds, a second spider crept out of the box. The Mayor sat up. Snyder stared in horror.</P>
<P>"Wouldn't leave that open." The Mayor said.</P>
<P>Buffy slammed the lid of the box shut just as a third creature was climbing out. Severed limbs clattered on the floor. As she crouched at the box, one of the spiders dropped on her back. She flipped onto her back, crushing it against the floor. </P>
<P>Faith saw the second spider climbing the wall behind Wesley and drew back her arm. Wesley saw her.</P>
<P>"No!" He yelled.</P>
<P>He ducked and Faith snapped the knife into the spider, killing it. The Mayor strode over to the box and picked it up.</P>
<P>"Is that all of them?" Oz asked.</P>
<P>"Ah, not really. You see, there's about fifty... billion of these happy little critters in here. Would you like to see?" The Mayor asked.</P>
<P>The cop finally got the front doors open. He and the vampires raced out of the room.</P>
<P>"Raise your hand if you're invulnerable. Faith, let's go." Faith stared at the impaled spider on the wall that still held her knife. "Faith."</P>
<P>Faith stared for another second at the gang and the knife, then followed him. Snyder was holding a chair to his chest.</P>
<P>"Snyder, you alive in there?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"You. All of you. Why couldn't you be dealing drugs like normal people?" He walked off.</P>
<P>"Well, that went swimmingly." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"We did alright." Buffy said, looking in relief at Willow. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the library, Willow was talking excitedly to Buffy, while Wesley and Giles watched.</P>
<P>"So Faith was like I'm going to beat you up and I'm all 'I'm not afraid of you' and then she had the knife which was less fun and then…"</P>
<P>"This is fascinating, but let's get back to the point. You actually had your hands on the Books of Ascension?" Giles asked.</P>
<P>"Volumes One through Five."</P>
<P>"Is there anything you can remember that could be of use to us? Anything at all?"</P>
<P>"Well, I was in a hurry, and what I did read was kind of over-involved. If you ask me, way over-written. Actually, there were a few pages that looked kind of interesting but I didn't have a chance to read them fully." Disappointment showed on Giles' face as she pulled some papers from her pocket. "See what you can make of them?"</P>
<P>Giles smiled and rushed off.</P>
<P>"This is your night for suave, Will. You should get captured more often." Buffy tried to make light of what happened, but couldn't. She hugged Willow, and wouldn't let her go. "On second thought, don't."</P>
<P>"Well, let's hope there is something useful in those pages. The Mayor has the Box of Gavrock. As of now, we are right back to where we started. Wouldn't you say?" Wesley said.</P>
<P>Buffy glared at him. "Screw you."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Later, Buffy and Willow were lying down on Buffy's bed.</P>
<P>"I think you're the one who's tense now." Willow said.</P>
<P>"I'm not letting you go. You almost…"</P>
<P>"But I didn't. I'm okay. See?"</P>
<P>Willow rolled Buffy onto her stomach and started to massage her back.</P>
<P>"You're better at this then me."</P>
<P>Willow smiled. "You passed up a chance to save the world for me tonight."</P>
<P>"You are the world to me. If you're not in it, then there's no reason for me to fight."</P>
<P>"How come you always know what to say?" </P>
<P>"Cause I follow my heart."</P>
<P>Willow rolled her onto her back again, and they kissed. She lowered her hands to Buffy's stomach.</P>
<P>"Oh no." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"You can' t get away this time."</P>
<P>Buffy pretended to try and get away, and Willow began to tickle her. Amid the laughter coming from both of them, Buffy thought to herself.</P>
<P><I>'Give up Willow? Never.'</i></P>
