<p><b>It's been a while, huh? Well... Hi :) This is for my star. As usual.</b></p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Lilly ~</p>
<p>I think today went well. Miley's friends seemed to like me, Miley seemed to <i>love</i> me, and school was a breeze. Most of the things currently being taught were what I already covered back in Malibu, so I had a fortunate head start. Though, that was no reason to completely ignore the lectures and distract Miley from them, who didn't share my privilege.</p>
<p>As days drifted by, I knew Miley and I had fallen into a close friendship, but there was the lingering issue of meeting 'Princess'. She'd tried on numerous occasions to tempt the wolf from the woods, calling out sweet things that made me smile. But Princess would never come. I felt sorry for her useless attempts and wanted so much to tell my dear friend why Princess never revealed herself, but I refrained. She wouldn't understand. Yes, Miley accepted peoples differences, even admired them, but this? This wasn't something even the most gracious person on the planet would understand. It was a condition too severe, too unfathomable for any human. I still couldn't believe it was real myself.</p>
<p>Miley offered a night at her house, but I could see she nursed a heavy heart that radiated a despondent air around her, which elicited an ache and a nauseous feeling from the core of a deep place within my chest. I couldn't keep things from her for much longer.</p>

<p>I looked out into the dark night from my bedroom window, wondering about Princess. I hadn't seen her in four days and I was beginning to worry. Was she hurt? Has she found another wolf to start a family with? I couldn't push the questions from my head because they were countless and I doubted there would be any answers, which made it only harder to think about them. I only became more confused when Lilly entered the picture. I couldn't figure out why she declined my dinner invite, but I knew there had to be a reason. Lilly may be secretive, but she wouldn't ditch just because she wanted to. I was certain of it.</p>
<p>I squinted, peering through the blackness carefully, not believing what I thought I had seen. A pale spot roamed the distance, growing as it approached the house with a hypnotising stealth. It darted behind the barn, then disappeared from my line of sight and I pressed my nose into the glass, trying to locate the white blur. The sensitive porch light was activated and the mystifying creature was exposed, meeting my stare with pleading blue eyes.</p>
<p>I gasped and gestured for Princess to wait as I bolted as quietly as I could from my room, hoping not to wake daddy and Jackson as I slowly eased the front door open, allowing the wolf to trot inside.</p>
<p>I travelled blindly up the stairs, not knowing whether Princess was following me or not and brushed my hand along the wall for guidance as I tip toed to my room. I closed and locked my door after entering and found Princess sitting on my carpeted floor, watching me silently. I knelt down and opened my arms as Princess leapt at me.</p>
<p>"I missed you," I whispered, burrowing my face into her fur, feeling secure. She whined, as if to return the sentiment and I withdrew, gazing into her bright eyes. I knew letting her into the house was a very bad idea, but I could care less about the consequences right now. "I have a present for you," I informed, chuckling at the way her tail wagged, thumping lightly against the floor. I sat on my bed and beckoned her over with my finger and she stood before me as I rummaged through my drawer. I pulled out a light blue collar, tracing my fingers over the diamond-studded lettering that spelt out 'Princess'. She followed my every move as the collar encircled her neck and the moment it was fastened, she was bathing my face in frantic licks. I giggled and pressed my hands into her chest, ceasing her attack. "I'm glad you like it."</p>
<p>I slid beneath my blankets once more and turned the lamp off, glancing at Princess as she sniffed the covers curiously. I lifted them up, welcoming her to join me. If she was dirty and smelly, I was too tired to take notice. She didn't waste a second in hopping into my bed and snuggling into me and I hugged her, finding sleep easier than it had ever been before.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>I awoke to the sound of car doors slamming, most likely daddy and Jackson leaving for the store. Daddy had mentioned the absence of steaks and I had been forced to lie, saying the freezer was malfunctioning because a lot of the meats were smelling off. He believed me and I felt horrible for lying to protect Princess. I didn't want to lose such a faithful companion only after having her for a few weeks. It was worth the lie.</p>
<p>I tightened my grip around the wolf, but found something I wasn't expecting. My eyes were still too heavy to open, so I explored the surface beneath my fingertips, not finding any fur at all. What I felt was smooth, velvet-like, and warm. I ventured lower and encountered a gentle protrusion of soft... flesh? A firm lump brushed my palm and I finally snapped my eyelids apart, finding a mess of blonde hair in my face. I leant myself up on my free arm and found a naked Lilly beside me, with my hand cupping her breast. I snatched it away, burned, and I spotted the blue collar around her neck.</p>
<p>In that moment, everything made sense and I dislodged myself from Lilly's nude body. I exited my room and crossed the hall to the bathroom, where I proceeded to freak out.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">~ Lilly ~</p>
<p>The first thing I realised was the feel of cotton on my skin. It was unobstructed by the thick fur that was meant to coat me and I shot up. I wasn't in wolf form. I looked around for Miley, but she wasn't in the room. I quickly encouraged my Change, hoping, praying, Miley hadn't seen me like this. I made my way out of her room, trailing after her scent, which led me to the half-closed door of the bathroom. I swallowed my fear and nudged the door open with my head, peeking around the corner to find Miley sitting on the toilet with the lid down, her head in her hands. As I got closer, my claws clicked against the tiled floor and her head lifted. What I saw terrified me. Her eyes, they were blank, dark, <i>scary</i>.</p>
<p>"Get out," she commanded. I froze. She glared at me. "I said get out! I know it's you Lilly! You're a fucking freak! Get out of here! I don't want to see you ever again!" She screamed, scrambling to her feet. I backed away, her burning eyes scarring my heart and shattering my soul. She hated me.</p>
<p>She opened her mouth, as if to say something, but stopped herself and merely pointed at the door. She met my gaze and the rage and confusion I saw conflicting in her now shimmering irises pushed me to turn tail and flee, feeling broken, betrayed, empty. Miley hated me.</p>
