<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Fourteen -->

<p>Megan was bored. She had spent most of the day reading, corresponding with friends, and writing while Randi busied herself with minor chores. Now she was restless, eyesore, and her behind was a little sore from sitting all day. She was in dire need of some pampering,
			<i>Some hot chocolate and cookies would do nicely right now, </i> or at least someone to talk to.
			<i>A certain tall, dark-haired doctor would do quite well too</i>, her little 'Charly' voice helpfully supplied.
			<i>Knock it off, </i> the voice of reason admonished, as she began her search for the woman in question.
			<i>It's not like there are a whole bunch of other people here to talk to. This is true, </i> little Charly agreed,
			<i>but you have to admit, the delightful Dr. Oakes is quickly moving up on that short list of people whose company you truly enjoy. Quite an accomplishment for one of
				<b>those</b> people, wouldn't you say?
			</i> "Oh, shut up," the blonde muttered aloud, effectively ending the debate.
		</p>
		<p>As much as she didn't want to, Megan had to admit, she
			<b>did</b> enjoy the tall woman's company. It had been a week since that night she had heard Randi cry out in her sleep. A week in which, against all odds, the two women had grown closer. A week of talking, laughing, mid-night snacks, and horror stories of their youth. Their conversations covered a world of topics and often sparked friendly debates that would keep them going until the wee hours of the morning. The only subjects the two women tended to steer clear of, were Megan's mother, and Randi's nightmares.
			<i>Perhaps someday</i>, the blonde mused, as she motored down the hallway in search of her hostess. She cracked a wry grin at the memory of one such 'debate.'
		</p>
		<p>"Oh baloney! They are too!" the blonde proclaimed obstinately, as she kept trying, and failing, to cross her arms at her chest.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm, I'm not so sure about that," the brunette returned, smiling benignly. She was playing 'devil's advocate,' and loving every minute.</p>
		<p>"Oh, don't give me that! You're one of
			<b>them</b>, and if you can't see it, then you're as blind as a bat."
		</p>
		<p>"See what? I've never seen them in a serious lip lock. I've never seen them roll around under the covers. And I'm certain I've never seen the Amazons presenting either one of them with a toaster." The tall woman couldn't help but grin at the green-eyed glare she was receiving.</p>
		<p>"Well of course you're not going to see that, the producers aren't stupid," the writer huffed, fully aware she was being baited, but enjoying herself anyway. "But you can still tell. I mean, look at how touchy-feely they are with each other. That's ?Ooowww" the blonde suddenly stiffened her foot, "cramp," she groaned.</p>
		<p>The brunette rose from her chair and crossed the room. Kneeling next to the bed, she uncovered and gently lifted the affected foot and began to massage it. "Are you talking about the consoling hugs, or the gentle touches?" Receiving no response, the doctor looked up into green eyes that were half closed in hedonistic pleasure from the gentle massage. "Or are you referring to how they tend to each other's hurts?" suppressing a grin as she felt the cramped muscle relax. "Offer comfort to each other when it's needed." She placed the foot back on the bed and pulled the cover back over it. Moving up to the head, she removed the extra pillow from behind the blonde, allowing her to lie prone in the bed. The writer remained quiet; listening and gazing fixedly through half-closed eyes as the tall woman tucked the covers around her. "Is that what you're talking about?" Randi leaned over and tenderly brushed away an errant lock of blond hair. "It doesn't necessarily mean they're lovers?" As the writer surrendered to slumber's call, twinkling blue eyes and whispered words followed her into Morpheus' realm.</p>
		<p>"?It just means they're friends."</p>
		<p>As the blonde neared her destination, she couldn't help but marvel at the smooth, subtle ease with which the doctor proved her point.
			<i>She was caring for me the same way they care for each other, and
				<b>we're</b> not lovers. Very smooth, doctor.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Aha, found ya, </i> the writer gloated when she heard the telltale 'clank' of barbells.
			<i>Time to?Oh, my! </i> The blonde's thought processes were put on immediate hold as she gazed in fascination at the sweating, straining figure lying on the slender metal bench. The tall doctor was doing reps with a set of barbells that, judging from the size of the metal discs on each side, had to weigh a great deal.
			<i>God, she's lifting that thing like it was made of paper! </i> Indeed, the only telltale signs of the effort Randi was putting into her chore were the even, labored breaths she was taking, and the rhythmic bunching and flexing of marvelously pronounced muscles.
			<i>Good grief, no wonder she can lift me like I weighed nothing. This woman is
				<b>built!</b> And speaking of built,
			</i>little Charly mischievously piped up as the writers eyes, quite unconsciously, began a thorough perusal of the body on the bench. From the long, tapered fingers that gripped the barbell, to the sneaker covered feet that were planted firmly on the floor, fascinated eyes covered every inch.
			<i>My word, she is a goddess! </i> On their return trip from the doctor's feet, the green eyes seemed intent on focusing on the full breasts, hard abdomen, and lean thighs that were painfully highlighted by the sweat-soaked clothing that clung to them. And try as she might to peruse other areas, the writer's gaze stubbornly kept returning to those rock hard thighs and, much to her consternation, the forbidden area in between. Unconsciously, she licked her lips, and was startled by the fluttering in her lower belly.
			<i>Oh, this isn't good?this isn't good at all. I think I need some cold water?to drink. Yup, a good, cold glass of water. </i> With her mind set on beating a hasty retreat, the blonde reached for the control switch and began to turn the chair around.
		</p>
		<p>"Hello there."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh, crap! </i>
		</p>
		<p>The writer turned the chair back around, plastering an innocent smile on her face and silently praying that her cheeks were not as red as they felt. "Um, hi there."</p>
		<p>"Is everything okay?" the brunette inquired, as she toweled the sweat from her face.</p>
		<p>"Uh, everything's fine," the writer semi-squeaked. If she thought her body's reactions were bad before, when Randi was on the bench, they were worse now. The tall woman stood less than five feet away from her. Close enough for the writer to see the droplets of sweat that traveled down the woman's chest, to disappear into her cleavage. Close enough to notice the small, pert nipples that were not quite erect, but not quite relaxed either. Close enough to smell the sweat, and the fragrance of hyacinth the she had come to associate with the tall doctor. And close enough for the little homophobic voice to be having a total meltdown.</p>
		<p>"Are you sure?" the doctor inquired, mildly concerned. "You're looking a little pink." She wanted to feel the smaller woman's forehead, to check for fever, but the slightly wild look in the writer's eyes told her it would not be a good idea right now.</p>
		<p>"Oh, yeah, I'm fine," the writer waved off the concern. "It's just a little warm in here."</p>
		<p>Not believing her for a moment, but deciding not to press the issue, the brunette shrugged. "Yeah, it tends to get a little humid in here when I'm exercising."</p>
		<p>Not getting a response from the smaller woman, and needing to dispel the odd tension in the air, the tall woman spoke again. "Hey, why don't we make our way to the living room and I'll pour you a nice, cold glass of iced tea. And while you're sipping on that, I'll jump in the shower and hose myself off, then come back and make us a couple of sandwiches?"</p>
		<p>
			<i>Bless you, doctor! </i> "That sounds like a winner," the younger woman agreed with a silent sigh of relief.
		</p>
		<p> Megan sat in front of the picture window idly sipping her iced tea. At first glance, one would assume that she was enjoying the picturesque view. Truth to tell, she wasn't even seeing it. She was too wrapped up in the battle that was going on inside her head.
			<i>What the fuck are you doing? </i> the homophobe was screaming.
			<i>First you stop treating her like the dirtbag she is, then you start talking to her?being nice to her?talking to her like you two are old friends. And now you're drooling over her while she's lifting weights. You're becoming a pervert?just like them, </i> the voice finished in a hiss.
			<i>No I'm not! </i> she retorted vehemently.
			<i> I was not 'drooling', I was just impressed by her physique, </i> the writer defended, earning a derisive snort from the homophobe.
			<i>And as for being nice to her, why the hell not? She's been good to me when she had absolutely no reason to be. She's helping me realize that the world isn't as black and white as you want me to think. That not every gay woman is evil. That some of them are wonderfully kind?and giving?and caring, </i> the writer trailed off as the burn of burgeoning tears stung her eyes.
			<i>Kind of like someone you used to know, eh, little one? </i> little Charly gently whispered.
			<i>No! Don't you even go there! </i> the writer snarled.
			<i>If she really cared she would have written to me, she would have called, she wouldn't have left me so alone. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"So alone," the writer croaked aloud as she buried her face in her hands and gave way to the tears that had been building for years.</p>
		<p>In a far corner of the room, two pair of eyes watched the young woman dissolve into tears. Both of them were distressed by the scene, but neither moved. No, this one was not for them to comfort. This was a job for the other; and she would be here soon.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Randi stood with her hands braced against the shower wall. Her head hung limply between outstretched arms, and she groaned in near-orgasmic bliss as the pounding spray of the twin showerheads assaulted her body from shoulders to calves. The hot, pulsing water massaged and relaxed tight, well-worked muscles, pushing the tall woman into a state of near boneless lassitude while her mind replayed the events in the weights room. She had been aware of the small woman's presence in the doorway, but, as the woman hadn't tried to get her attention in any way, she saw no need to interrupt her workout, figuring that everything was fine, and the young woman was just watching her out of idle curiosity. However, the sight of the writer as she approached her caused the doctor to re-think her earlier assessment. The younger woman's face was flushed, her eyes wide and slightly glassy. Her pupils, what little there was of them, had taken on a darker shade, and her breathing was slightly elevated. The doctor was immediately concerned but, not wanting to argue with her patient, accepted her word that it was just the heat.
			<i>I don't buy that for a minute. Room temperature doesn't make your eyes go all glassy and dark. And it certainly doesn't elevate your breathing?unless the heat is a little more extreme. No, she was showing all the signs of being totally embarrassed, or flustered, or? </i>Randi's head shot up and her eyes grew saucer wide as the final thought hit her.
			<i>Or aroused!!?? Oh no, no way?huh uh?no possible way, </i>Randi's mind shouted furiously, as she turned and grabbed the soap.
			<i>This is not happening. This is your overactive imagination, Oakes. Yes, she's beautiful. Yes, she's bright, and witty, and warm,
				<b>but</b>? she is not that way?she never will be that way?she doesn't like that way. And even if she's having doubts and wants to try that way, you will
				<b>not</b> be her guinea pig! So derail that train of thought and drop the whole issue. Accept her explanation and leave it at that.
			</i>

		<p>Randi sighed as she stepped out of the shower and grabbed her towel. Part of her was glad that her conscience knocked some sense into her head. But another part of her ached at things that could never be.</p>
