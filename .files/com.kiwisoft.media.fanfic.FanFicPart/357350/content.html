<!-- A Thin Line \ Part 2-->

<p>Sam took a step back from the stove and ran a hand through her hair.
Turning she looked at the table, it was still set.  Then she looked at the
counter, it was still clean.  After that she looked at the pie.  It was
still baked.  Everything was ready.  In fact everything was perfect.  The
entire thing had gone according to plan.  That being said she couldn't
understand why she was suddenly feeling nervous as hell.  She wondered if it
was too late to call over some of her friends to referee.  Carmyn and
Harrison were fond of Brooke, and with them there if the dinner turned into
a fiasco she was sure they would stop her from killing Brooke, and vice
versa.  Sam was seriously starting to give the idea some thought when she
heard someone coming down the stairs.  Brooke.  Sam cursed under her breath
and quickly ripped the apron she had been wearing off of her body.  Looking
around for some place to put it she panicked and shoved it under the sink.
She then ran her hand through her hand and clasped her hands behind her back
waiting patiently-and she hoped casually-for Brooke to appear.</p>

<p>"Smells delicious," Brooke commented upon entering the room.</p>

<p>"Let's hope it tastes the same way," Sam responded smiling as she brought
the dishes over to the table.  Brooke smiled at her nervously and sat down.
Sam saw the look and smiled.  "If it makes you feel better I can start
eating first."</p>

<p>"I don't think that'll be necessary," Brooke said sending Sam a small smile.
Still she waited until Sam had started to eat to pick up her own fork.</p>

<p>Sam looked over at Brooke contemplatively.  If there was one thing they had
had time for it was deep musings seeing as how conversation wasn't exactly
flowing like a fountain at the table.  At first they had talked haltingly
about inconsequential, and truth be told, inane things.  Brooke had
apparently been curious about what spices Sam had used, and which was better
for stir-fry a deep or shallow bowled wok.  And Sam, she was curious about
the rug in the living room.  Was it Persian?  Arabian?  She didn't know and
saw fit to ask the question.</p>

<p>When they started to run out of banal questions to ask, and had completely
exhausted the subject of the weather-including an almost philosophical
discussion of whether or not Fahrenheit was a better measure than
Celsius-Brooke in a rather desperate attempt to stave of silence had said,
"How about that Kosovo situation?  Crazy, huh?" which rightfully sent Sam
off into a fit of hysterics.</p>

<p>They were now sitting in silence and Brooke could feel Sam's eyes on her.
Without looking up she said softly and perhaps most importantly sincerely,
"You didn't have to do this."</p>

<p>"No," Sam agreed looking down at her almost empty plate.  "I didn't, did I?"</p>

<p>"Do you always have to answer people with questions?" Brooke asked looking
up.</p>

<p>"You're the one who just answered a question with a question," Sam pointed
out.  "Aren't you?" she added looking up at Brooke with a smile.</p>

<p>Brooke wanted to laugh at that, Sam could tell because of the way her lips
twitched, but she managed to control it.</p>

<p>"Why did you then?"</p>

<p>"What I said today," Sam responded.  "It's common knowledge that dinner is
one of the universal signs of peace."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it wasn't just to give me a heart attack?"  Brooke asked.  "I
know how much you want that right sink."</p>

<p>Sam smiled at that.</p>

<p>"That was...how shall I put it...an unexpected bonous," Sam replied.  "Brooke
McQueen," she continued waving her hand in the air dramatically, "the
mono-symbolic beauty queen."</p>

<p>"Clever," Brooke replied, though she didn't actually look impressed.</p>

<p>"Think you can stomach some dessert?" Sam asked standing up.</p>

<p>"Definitely," Brooke responded.  She was actually very surprised by how
proficient a cook Sam was.  A few months earlier she wouldn't have believed
Sam could cook anything that didn't include eye of newt.</p>

<p>Since they had been forced to move in together as a result of their parent's
upcoming nuptials, Brooke and Sam had tended to avoid each other as much as
possible when they were both in the house.  It was a big house so it wasn't
as difficult a task as it may have sounded.  However, after sitting through
an entire meal together-one that went better that either of them had
expected-it seemed stupid to them to proceed with "Avoiding Each Other 101",
at least for the night, and they settled down in the family room together.</p>

<p>"You know," Brooke said flipping on the television.  "I think this is the
first time we've been in this room at the same time."</p>

<p>"You're probably right," Sam agreed eyeing Brooke.  Turning her eyes back to
the television she looked at it surprised.  "Do you actually like this show
or are you just leaving it there for my benefit?"</p>

<p>"I happen to be an aficionado," Brooke said smiling.</p>

<p>"Let me guess, you like it because of the cute detective," Sam said leaning
back in the chair smugly.  Brooke looked over at the satisfied expression on
the brunette's face and smiled to herself wickedly.</p>

<p>"No," she said trying to clamp down on the knowing laugh that was
threatening to erupt from her throat.  "I like it because of the cute
lawyer."</p>

<p>"Ewww," Sam responded making a face.  "He could be your grandfather."</p>

<p>"I wasn't talking about him," Brooke said pointedly looking at the screen,
which was now occupied by a striking brunette woman.</p>

<p>It took a moment for Brooke's meaning to settle with Sam, but when it did
her eyes bugged out of her head and she sat up leaning towards Brooke.</p>

<p>"Her?" Sam asked in a hushed tone pointing at the screen.</p>

<p>"Come on," Brooke said now very much struggling to contain her amusement.
"You've gotta admit...she's got one hell of a fine behind."  Sam turned and
stared at the blonde in front of her in a state of complete bewilderment,
befuddlement, stupification and a myriad of other adjectives.  Brooke
McQueen was commenting-with appreciation-about another woman's ass.</p>

<p>Brooke looked over in Sam's direction and when she saw the look on the other
girl's face she completely lost it and dissolved into a fit of laughter.
Sam looked over at Brooke and scowled.</p>

<p>"One day your face is going to freeze that way," Brooke said in-between
laughing fits.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to remember why we avoid each other," Sam muttered darkly.
Brooke looked over at her when Sam said that.</p>

<p>"I was just rompin' with you," Brooke responded.  "Completely innocent.
Family and friends do it all the time.  I guess I'm projecting, but if
tonight is an indication of anything it's that we can get along without
someone being clawed to death.  And, I figure since we're going to be forced
to be family, we could as well be friends and have a happily ever after."</p>

<p>"Yeah I guess," Sam responded moodily.  "But that's not why I'm..."</p>

<p>"Scowling?" Brooke offered.</p>

<p>"Offended," Sam corrected.</p>

<p>"Offended?" Brooke asked.</p>

<p>"Homosexuality isn't a punch-line," Sam responded.</p>

<p>"Does everything have to be a crusade with you?" Brooke asked shaking her
head.  "Besides, did it ever occur to you that maybe I just have an
appreciation for the female form?" Brooke continued slowly as she pointed
raked her eyes over Sam's body.</p>

<p>"Stop it," Sam complained after a moment.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Brooke's voice was innocent as could be even though her eyes
were firmly focused on Sam's chest as the words came out of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Checking me out," Sam responded after a moment.  She felt a blush rushing
to her cheeks and with it a swell of irritation.</p>

<p>"Why?  Does it make you uncomfortable?" Brooke asked in a semi-mocking tone
as a smile spread across her face.</p>

<p>"Yes, but don't think that you can pin me with being close-minded or
hypocritical," Sam started seeing that look in Brooke's eyes that meant
trouble.  They fought with each other enough that it was now obvious to them
when the other was gearing up for blow-out and Sam sensed one coming.</p>

<p>"What makes you think I want to pin you at all?" The blonde retorted
saucily, though her gaze was intense.</p>

<p>"Don't change the subject," Sam responded a little unnerved.  Brooke was
flirting with her...or at least trying to make it seem like she was flirting
with her.  There was sexual innuendo and Sam wasn't sure what to do with it.
  "It doesn't bother me because you think you're being clever, or because
you're a girl.  It bothers me because you think you're being chic."</p>

<p>"Okay," Brooke said slowly.  "So you're not being hypocritical, you're being
judgmental and narrow-minded.  You don't have one thread of evidence to
prove I'm being trendy versus sincere other than you don't like me."</p>

<p>"Yes I do," Sam said thinking frantically trying to come up with a thread of
evidence other than intense dislike and a chronic inability to trust
cheerleaders.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked smugly.</p>

<p>"You're 'appreciation of the female form'," Sam said mockingly, "wouldn't
hold up if put to the test.  To put it another way, you're all bark and no
bite."</p>

<p>"You don't know that," Brooke responded in a more subdued tone.  The fact
was that the conversation had taken on a life of it's own and Brooke wasn't
sure she wanted to go where it was going.  Although it all had started as a
way for her to get the better of Sam she had been honest with what she had
said up that point.  Still, she was in high school, she was a cheerleader,
she was popular and she wasn't about to admit anymore to someone she had
just barely begun to like and still wouldn't trust any farther than she
could throw her.  The last thing she needed was to come to school on Friday
and see the headline: "Gay love in the inner circle" or "Queer as McQueen"
or "Mrs. And Mrs. Perfect" tag lined with "by: Sam McPherson"</p>

<p>"I think it's safe to say," Brooke went on, "that I'm the only person in
this room who's an authority on what Brooke McQueen thinks and feels.  You
can't prove an emotion.  You stubborn ass."</p>

<p>"Yes you can," Sam responded ignoring the last part of Brooke's statement
but filing it away for future use nonetheless.  Even as the words came out
of her mouth and the plan formed in her head she knew it wasn't a good idea
but was powerless to resist.</p>

<p>"How?" Brooke asked even though she was not at all sure that she wanted to
hear the answer.</p>

<p>"Kiss me," Sam replied in a perfectly even tone.</p>

<p>And there it was.</p>

<p>"You're insane," Brooke declared getting up.  "I'm going to bed."</p>

<p>"It's only eight-thirty," Sam replied derisively.</p>

<p>"I'm tired," Brooke shot back.  "Associating with you is exhausting."</p>

<p>"Tired, or a liar," Sam challenged.  "You say you have this completely
un-chic appreciation for the female form.  Well, I'm female, I've got a
form...appreciate me."</p>

<p>"I never said I had an appreciation for YOUR female form," Brooke muttered
darkly as she hovered by the door.  However, even as the words left her
mouth she found herself looking at Sam once again through her eyelids.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with my female form?" Sam asked self-consciously looking down
at herself, her brows furrowing momentarily.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Brooke admitted with a sigh.  And as she looked at Sam she
realized that it was true.  She was a very attractive young woman.  Very.</p>

<p>"Then kiss me," Sam said standing up and moving over towards Brooke.  "Prove
me wrong."</p>

<p>"Has anybody ever told you that you're a pig-headed, obnoxious ass?"</p>

<p>"Take the wind out of my sails then," Sam challenged, her heart racing for
reasons she didn't care to examine at the moment.</p>

<p>"You asked for it," Brooke responded and with that she dropped her arms from
where they were crossed against her chest protectively and walked the few
steps over to where Sam was standing.</p>

<p>They regarded each other for a moment; Sam was wishing she had dropped the
subject and Brooke also wishing Sam had dropped the subject.  Finally,
Brooke leaned forward and brushed her lips against Sam's softly.  She had
expected the brunette to pull away once their lips met but to both of their
surprise she didn't.  And as if that wasn't a strange enough occurrence,
Brooke who had planned on pulling away once Sam did, instead licked Sam's
bottom lip and pushed their lips more firmly together.</p>

<p>Then even though she was firmly enjoying the contact-much to her chagrin I
must add-Brooke was certain that Sam that would pull away.  Brooke was
wrong, Sam didn't pull away.  In fact, much to the surprise of both
beautiful parties, Sam's lips parted, and when they parted Brooke's tongue
entered her mouth and Sam let her in with a soft moan.  Sam's hand then came
to rest on the side of Brooke's face and Brooke's hand went the back of
Sam's neck and neither of them were even entertaining the thought of pulling
away anymore.  Pulling each other closer their lips met again and again in a
passionate, hungry embrace as their tongues dueled with each other and their
bodies strained to make contact.</p>

<p>And when they both needed air and they pulled apart, and their hands
dropped, and as they came back to themselves and realized what they had
done, and how thoroughly enjoyable it had been, they became in essence two
deer caught in some very bright headlights.</p>

<p>"I'm just going to go to bed now," Brooke said slowly as she took a step
back from Sam.  Her heart was racing, and her head felt like it was going to
float off of her body so she took a moment to compose herself before
continuing.  "You have a good night then, alright," and with that she turned
around and carefully made her way out of the room leisurely walking up the
stairs although every bone in her body told her to bolt and never look back.</p>

<p>Once Brooke was out of the room, Sam raised a finger to her lips and traced
them slowly.  They were still tingling, it was as if she could still feel
Brooke's lips on her.  She turned to look into the hallway, which was now
vacant, and dropped down into an armchair with a sigh.  She had kissed
Brooke McQueen and she had not only liked it, she had loved it.  There was
something inherently wrong with that principle, they were foes, rivals,
adversaries, they were supposed to love hating each other, not love loving
each other.  Then again, Sam thought to herself with a sardonic smile, it's
a thin line between love and hate.</p>
