<P>a/n: welll here's the third chapter …dunno if any of you guys actually like it or have any ideas or any concerns or anything you don't like about this…cause I only got one review (and hey thanks for that btw, even though it was just one word :[ ), buuut if you guys would like to…you could leave a review about hating this story, mildly enjoying it, liking it, approving of it, or loving it…any thing just be honest. :D thanks. & I THINK I know what I want to do with this story …just hope I don't get off track…</P><P>Chapter Three: SEE YOU AGAIN</P><P>I headed up the steps to the room my mom and I had rented for a month in the bed and breakfast, at the top of the steps I glanced out there window there to see Miley getting on an old four wheeler that was parked out by the stables and riding it out towards the street; I waved at her…then stopped realizing it was dark, and she probably also didn't expect me to wave. I turned from the window, glancing back just once out the window I saw her raise her hand into the air and wave towards the window.</P><P>Grinning stupidly to myself I tried to quietly make my way down the hall way to our room without disturbing the other people in the house. 'Maybe she likes me,' I thought to myself, pulling the door to the room open and stumbling tiredly over to the bed...I got a wiff of myself and decided I needed a shower...but I would lay down just for a minute and rest then take one…</P><P>I woke to hear a rooster crowing and my mother saying, "Oh wow…we must be in the country if there is one of those chicken things outside our window…" and then, "Damn! Lilly, you stink…and you've got some sort of poop tracked in and on your shoes, go take a shower!"</P><P>She threw a pillow at me and I groaned, "I'm soo tired though mom…what time it is? I feel like I just fell asleep…"</P><P>"It's 6:38."</P><P>"Aw mommm, I am not getting up! Isn't this suppose to be vacation…" I yawned, rolling over on to my stomache.</P><P>"Lilly, but your clothes and shoes are gross…honestly, you've even got something on your butt…what it that? Is that poop too? What were you doing all night?" She questioned, and I heard her walk over closer to me…probably to get a better look at whatever was on my clothes.</P><P>"I was in the stables with Miley." I mumbled, then grinned to myself at the thought of Miley…that was enough right there to get me out of bed.</P><P>"Oh who's Miley?" She asked, "I saw you looking at some cutie yesterday…"</P><P>"Cutie? Who's a cuite?" I asked nervously.</P><P>"Oh some boy, I think Mrs. Stewart said his name is Travis…didn't you meet him? Mrs. Stewart said him and Miley are pretty close…dating maybe even. So you better keep you distance if you want to be friends with that Miley Stewart." Mom laughed.</P><P>"Oh….they're dating huh?" Suddenly getting out of bed didn't sound like such a good idea.</P><P>"Well, no need to get down, Mrs. Stewart was just guessing…she wishes they were though. Maybe you'll still have a shot with Travis if that's what you want."</P><P>"Ohh yeah…" I muttered sarcastically.</P><P>Mom walked away, towards the door it sounded like, "Now get up and clean that crap off you then meet me downstairs…Mrs. Stewart says she makes some great omelets." Then she left me in silence to dwell over this Miley and Travis dilemma.</P><P>'Cute boy, or boring girl…what's she going to want? …a cute boy. It's more socially acceptable and more likely.' I pouted to myself, then rolled out of bed grabbing some of my better clothes from my suit case to wear after I showered, I opened the door to the room and headed towards the one bath room upstairs for the four bedrooms up there. I could at least clean up and try to have some fun while stuck here, 'Maybe Miley has a sister…'</P><P>I stepped out of the shower and grabbed one of the many provided towels off of the counter to dry off with, and just as a was shaking the towel off to wrap around myself…the door to the bathroom swung open….and there stood no other than Miley.</P><P>"Uhh," I said, realizing she was staring at my naked body that was in plain view, me having dropped the towel in surprise when I saw it was her. "Sorry."</P><P>"Oh, Lilly! Uhh…" She stared at my chest, "Uhhh…um, oh uh…wow." She shook her head, "Oh god, I mean sorry!" She shielded her eyes from me, as if she hasn't already seen everything. "Lemme j-just uh, get the door." She blinded groped for the door knob, I leaned down to get my towel off the floor…standing back up, I got groped in the chest by Miley, who thought it was the door of course. "Oh my…uh," She pulled her hand away quickly then ran off down the steps. I noticed her face was bright red…like mine, as I kicked the door closed, dried off as fast I could then pulled on all my clothes…not wanting to risk anybody else running in and having another awkward grope or anything.</P><P>I sighed, 'God, this isn't how I imagined this trip so far…spending my first night here caked in horse shit, then getting groped by some really hot girl in the morning. Oh no, not how I imagined this trip at all.' I rolled my eyes, and went down the stairs to meet my mom in the dining area for the guests.</P><P>"Hey mom," I said, sliding down into the chair across from her.</P><P>She looked up from her menu she was reading, "Oh Lillian, your hair is all wet…you could've at least dried it off."</P><P>"Uhh, yeah sorry I didn't know where you put the blow drier." I lied; actually I just didn't want to have Miley come back upstairs and try to awkwardly apologize…let's save that fun little activity for later.</P><P>"It's right in my bag; all you had to do was look." She sighed shaking her head at me.</P><P>"I'm lazy."</P><P>"Lillian, you really are. Maybe this trip will have you a little more active by the end of it. There's horseback riding and hiking trails that you can do. I'll be going to the spa's and what not in the next town over most of the time probably."</P><P>"Why can't I go too?" I whined.</P><P>"You didn't want to. I offered Lilly, you whined and said for me to leave you anywhere else…so you'll be staying here."</P><P>"That was before I got groped by a really hot girl while I was wet…" I mumbled.</P><P>"What did you say?" she said, only half listening to me as her attention went back to the menu.</P><P>"Oh nothing, mother." I said sarcastically.</P><P>"Well, okay. I'll just be having a bit of toast and coffee then I'm heading over to the spa resort for a couple of days. I'll leave you with my credit card, buy whatever you please in this little town…there isn't much, so have fun with that." She said looking up at me. "And get whatever you like to eat from here, or wherever. Just don't get into any trouble…" She laughed, "Oh but what kind of trouble could there be around here…the population in this town is about 400 people or something."</P><P>"Mom, come on…it's really not that bad here."</P><P>"Well, that's a change of tune for you." She glanced at her watch, "Actually forget the coffee and toast; I've got to get going." She got up leaving me a credit card from out of her wallet. "Go nuts." She laughed.</P><P>I sighed, taking the credit card from her, 'I don't know why but I actually thought maybe she'd stick around here for a little longer this trip…after the whole dad thing and all, but I shouldn't have kidded myself…she hates small towns unless they've got a huge mall or a spa resort.' As I watch her go, I noticed Miley lurking by the doors to the kitchen. I smiled warily at her…she sure upset, about something dumb like an accidental groping, for a straight girl that had a boyfriend or boyfriend-to-be.</P>
