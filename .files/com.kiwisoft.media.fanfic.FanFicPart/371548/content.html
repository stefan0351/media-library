<P><B>Disclaimer: I own nothing... I made Joel up, hes like a personal trainer that has no idea. </B></p>
<P>The Instructor, Joel as he had introduced himself as, was slowly passing through the couples stretching, he spotted a couple who seemed very uncomfortable in their new positions. Checking the role he refreshed himself on their names.</p>
<P>"Sebastian", he said walking over to them, the young man didn't respond.</p>
<P>"Sebastian!", he tried again.</p>
<P>Olivia groaned as Viola moved her leg higher, and Viola simply groaned uncomfortable about her position on top of Olivia. The scent of the other girl was tempting Viola, that lingering strawberry scent, the same one she wore when she was trying to snag Sebastian in high school. Viola breathed in deeply and attempted to concentrate as Olivia groaned again, Viola was trying so hard on not concentrating on Olivia that she notice Olivia whispering her name, till the other girl added a shove, in an attempt to get Viola's attention.</p>
<P>"Viola?", whispered Olivia, shoving Viola a little harder than she had intended.</p>
<P>"What?", asked Viola as she tried to untangle her body from Olivia's, Olivia just pointed at Joel, in response to Viola's question.</p>
<P>"Sebastian?", confirmed Joel, standing over to the couple.</p>
<P>"Yes, Sir", said Viola in her best attempt at a manly voice.</p>
<P>"We have a problem", said Joel looking at Viola and then Olivia.</p>
<P>"We do?", asked Viola trying to make her voice deeper.</p>
<P><I>'Sprung'</I>, thought Olivia.</p>
<P>"We can explain... ah... sir", said Olivia.</p>
<P>"There's nothing to explain", said Joel.</p>
<P>"This needs to be fixed right now", he continued.</p>
<P>Olivia and Viola exchanged puzzled looks.</p>
<P>"Intimacy is what makes a good relationship better", continued Joel.</p>
<P>"You have a problem with intimacy, don't you Sebastian?", asked Joel, and before Viola could respond he continued.</p>
<P>"And we are here to fix that... Lie down there, Sebastian", instructed Joel pointing to the floor, Viola followed his instructions and lay down.</p>
<P>"Okay now you guys have performed the final intimate act, haven't you?" asked Joel, Viola shrugged not understanding what Joel was on about, she looked up at Olivia, Olivia just shrugged back.</p>
<P>Joel looked between the pair and realized they had not idea what he was asking.</p>
<P>"Have you had sex?" he asked simply.</p>
<P>"Yeah", said Viola quickly.</p>
<P>"Good", said Joel about to continue when Viola interrupted him.</p>
<P>"Wait, with each other?" Viola asked.</p>
<P>Joel nodded and looked at Viola expectantly.</p>
<P>Viola just looked up to Olivia, Olivia nodded and Viola felt her heart break, Viola nodded to Joel who continued with his instructions.</p>
<P>Viola did as he said but her mind was somewhere else. She couldn't stop thinking about her brother and Olivia, and it made her sick, she knew why but she didn't want to admit to that now. So she just suppressed the urge to scream and followed Joel's instructions.</p>
<P>"Okay, Olivia now you just climb on top there", said Joel, Olivia did as he asked and moved on top of Viola.</p>
<P>"Good okay now just stay like that", said Joel as he walked away.</p>
<P>"Wait", said Viola, very uncomfortable with the amount of people around them, even though they weren't playing attention.</p>
<P>"What is this stretching?", asked Viola as Joel came back.</p>
<P>"Stretching?", said Joel puzzled. "Right.. oh... nothing I guess", he said shrugging.</p>
<P>"What, what kind of instructor are you?" asked Viola.</p>
<P>"A wealthy one", said Joel looking around at all the stretching couples.</p>
<P>"Alright everyone thats enough, I want you to practice those throughout the week, especially you and Olivia, Sebastian", Viola gulped, as Joel continued.</p>
<P>"Now we are going to play a quick game of soccer", said Joel holding up a soccer ball.</p>
<P>Viola grinned this was were she shinned, or so she thought.</p>
<P>"Friendly soccer that is, everyone pair off with your partner for one on one passing", said Joel as everyone grabbed their partners.</p>
<P>Viola groaned as Olivia dragged her off to a secluded part of the hall. They could hear Joel's annoying voice in the background as they passed the ball between them.</p>
<P>"Now everyone picture the ball as your relationship, share it with your partner, share the bad parts and the good. You both make up this relationship, therefore you shall share everything within it." said Joel, as he continued pacing.</p>
<P>By the end of the night, Olivia and Viola were both tried, Olivia physically and Viola mentally. Olivia had been putting her all into trying to stretch and as well as the ball excises. Where as Viola had been trying so hard not to just walk out during the "friendly" soccer game, and had been trying even harder to not be tempted by Olivia's presence.</p>
<P>Viola said goodbye to Olivia and trudged back to her dorm.</p>
<P><I>'Sebastian's and Olivia's relationship... oh sorry "ball" better be perfect after this</I>', she thought.</p>
<P>As Viola climbed into her bed she started to question herself as to whether that was what she really wanted. She was beginning to doubt it was.</p>
<P><B>Authors Note: READ AND REVIEW please please... Next chapter what will happen next class? Will Olivia and Viola get more than physically close?</B></p>
