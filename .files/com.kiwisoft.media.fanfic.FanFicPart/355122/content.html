<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Eight -->

<p>Brooke sat next to Harrison in the movie theater wishing she could pry her hand away from his uncomfortable, hot sweaty one. But everytime she tried it seemed like he only tightened his grip. She was spending the entire time in the theater wishing someone would yell 'fire' so that she could escape Harrison. Visions of Harrison as the dastardly evil landowner and she herself as the damsel tied to the train tracks filled her mind. The only bright spot in that fantasy was that her hero came in the form of Sam, complete in a red Mountie suit and hat. She smiled at the image which caused Harrison to misinterpret the situation. </p>
<p>"I'm glad you're having a good time," he whispered. Brooke sighed and nodded mutely. She didn't want to cause a scene in the movie house. She wanted to let Harrison down in private. She swallowed the groan that threatened to escape her as Harrison slipped his arm around her shoulders. He was a great guy and all but such intimate and familiar contact with someone she considered a stranger made her skin crawl. Intellectually she knew that was the wrong reaction but emotionally it's how she felt. She couldn't help thinking how much she would rather the arm around her belonged to Sam. </p>
<p>(Yeah, I'm out on a date with Harrison but I can't stop thinking about Sam. I am completely smitten with her) she realized ruefully. She watched as the couple onscreen engaged in a passion filled kiss and couldn't stop herself from replacing the actors with herself and Sam. It was almost tearing her heart in two to watch the love and tenderness on the screen while she was wishing that she could share such a connection with Sam. And yet here she was out with Harrison. An absurd giggle bubbled up before she could contain it. </p>
<p>"Sorry," she mumbled when Harrison looked at her strangely. She fought to control any more chortles that threatened to make themselves known. She just found it hysterically funny that here she was, out with someone most people would consider cute and she knew some other girls would love to date, but all she cared about was the ravishing, brown eyed, brown haired journalist that she'd left at home. Someone who was at that moment probably not even thinking about her as she babysat Mac. Brooke let out a heavy sigh as she realized that her feelings were probably one-sided. </p>
<p>"You OK?" Harrison asked concerned. </p>
<p>"I'm fine." (Is this movie EVER going to end?) </p>
<p>"I'm glad you're out with me." </p>
<p>"Uh-huh." (Oh God, somebody shoot me) </p>
<p>"I think you're spending too much time with Sam," Harrison said bitterly. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh," Brooke answered absently. (WHA...?) "WHAT?" </p>
<p>"Sshhhh..." someone hissed from behind them. Brooke muttered an apology and then turned back to her date. </p>
<p>"Want to run that by me again?" she whispered hotly. Harrison shook his head.</p>
<p>"Harrison, I think we need to have a long talk," Brooke suggested. </p>
<p>"But the movie," he protested. </p>
<p>"Is over," Brooke declared as she stood up. Harrison hung his head and nodded. </p>
<p>"OK." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The contrast between the dark movie theater and the overly lit Dunkin Donuts was starting to give Brooke a headache. It was also making Harrison look like a deer caught in the headlights as he desperately clutched his mocha and listened to her words. </p>
<p>"Harrison, I really don't think that this is working out," she started slowly. She was barely through the sentence before Harrison started frantically shaking his head in protest. </p>
<p>"Brooke, you haven't given it enough time. You've experienced a really bad trauma and things are bound to feel a bit strange for awhile. Just give it time and things will fall back into place," he explained patiently in a tone one would reserve for a two year old. Brooke bristled at the tone. </p>
<p>"First of all, don't speak to me like I'm retarded, brain damaged or a child. I know I may not be up to speed on a lot of things but I am NOT stupid," she snapped angrily. </p>
<p>"Second, I've given this nothing BUT time, Harrison. And it's not working. It's not fair to waste my time or yours on something that's not ever going to go anywhere. We're spinning our wheels here," she told him firmly. </p>
<p>"But Brooke," Harrison began. </p>
<p>"No, you're not listening to me. Harrison, it's over. We're over." He glared at her. </p>
<p>"Sam turned you against me," he hissed. Brooke stared at him in shock. </p>
<p>"Excuse me? Which one of us recently took a blow to the head? That's insane and untrue," she spat back. </p>
<p>"No, it's not. You've been spending all your time with her and she's twisted your view of me. Damn her, I knew she was going to do something like this. Jealous little bitch." </p>
<p>"Hey! Don't talk about her like that. I spend my time with Sam because she's the only one who treats me like a normal human being. She doesn't behave like I've been in an accident. She doesn't insist that I act the way I used to or remember things that I can't. She's just happy to spend time with me without expectations," Brooke ranted angrily. She was upset that Harrison was trying to blame Sam for the break-up. She would be dumping Harrison even if she didn't have feelings for Sam. They were just an added bonus. </p>
<p>"She's made you think badly of me, same as she does," Harrison countered. Brooke rolled her eyes in frustration. </p>
<p>"For Christ's sake, she doesn't even talk about you. And when she does, she never says anything bad. Even when I ask what happened to your friendship she refuses to speak ill of you. So don't sit there and try to blame her for what's not her fault. I can think for myself, you know." </p>
<p>Harrison stared at her numbly for several minutes as the reality of the situation sank in. </p>
<p>"You're really ending this, aren't you?" he asked in a whisper. </p>
<p>"Yes," Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Why? I don't understand. We were so happy," Harrison said sadly. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, YOU were happy. I was just along for the ride, Harrison. And the ride is over, I'm getting off here," she declared standing up. "I'm sorry," she tried to apologize but her words sounded hollow even to herself. </p>
<p>(It's hard to sound sincere when there's no genuine feeling behind it) she said to herself. Harrison buried his face in his hands as Brooke left the building and headed to a payphone to call Sam to come and pick her up. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam tucked the blanket in around Mac and sighed. She was really hoping that Brooke's date was going all right. As bad as her relationship with Harrison had gotten, she couldn't help feeling sorry for him. He had finally gotten everything he'd pined away for his entire life and it was stolen from him by a stupid accident. </p>
<p>(If it wasn't for that stupid tree, they probably would have lived happily ever after) she thought sadly. The entire idea of Brooke and Harrison together left a sour taste in her mouth. But Sam was determined not to let her growing feelings for Brooke color her judgment or decisions anymore. She was surprised that her feelings were growing even though this Brooke was essentually a new person. She had loved who Brooke was before the accident and thought that maybe since that person was gone in all practical sense, her feelings would fade. But they hadn't. As she spent time with the 'new' Brooke, they came roaring back even stronger. </p>
<p>"Why can't anything in my life ever be easy?" she whispered to Mac who was cuddled with a teddy bear. Mac opened one eye and then closed it again. Seeing that the baby wasn't going to give her the answers she wanted, Sam walked to her room and sat on her bed. She was glad that Brooke felt so comfortable with her. It gave her a sense of purpose to be able to help her as much as she did. But it was hard too, to let Brooke that close and ignore her feelings. </p>
<p>"At least she's still alive," Sam told herself. She lay down and had started to doze off when her phone rang. </p>
<p>"Hullo?" she mumbled groggily. </p>
<p>"Sammy? Did I wake you? I'm sorry but I need a ride home," Brooke apologized. Sam was instantly awake worried about why Harrison wasn't giving Brooke a ride home. </p>
<p>"What's wrong?" she asked. She heard Brooke sigh. </p>
<p>"Harrison is having a breakdown over his French Vanilla mocha or something and I want to come home. Can I bother you to come and get me at Dunkin Donuts?" Brooke asked sheepishly. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"It's not a bother, Brooke. I'll be there in ten," she said. </p>
<p>"Thanks Sammy, you're the best. I owe you." Sam just grinned and hung up the phone before heading to her car. </p>
