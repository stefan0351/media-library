<P>"Mmmmm." </P>
<P>"Seven?" B'Elanna said with a start, while taking her face out of the Borg's
neck.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven whispered, bleary-eyed.</P>
<P>"Yeah, it's me. Glad you could make it back to the conscious world."</P>
<P>B'Elanna softly brushed the hair away from Seven's eyes. The tender action
froze Seven for a brief second.</P>
<P>"I…am glad as well," Seven said nervously.</P>
<P>"Good, then we're both glad." </P>
<P>B'Elanna lightly stroked Seven's hair, once again drawing it back behind the
Borg's head. Seven could feel every stroke, every caress, and every tingle
caused by B'Elanna's gentle ministrations. </P>
<P>"I believe the intensified bio-electric field caused my Borg implants to
malfunction."</P>
<P>"And that's why you blacked out, right?" B'Elanna jumped at the
opportunity.</P>
<P>"Precisely," Seven said, extremely relieved.</P>
<P>Heartbeat beginning to slow down again, B'Elanna took a deep breath, and
decided to move the conversation into a more comfortable direction.</P>
<P>"You know, while you were out, I tried to tie your hair back into a bun."</P>
<P>"You did not succeed."</P>
<P>"Is it that obvious?" B'Elanna continued the soft strokes. "How in the world
do you get your hair into a bun anyway?" </P>
<P>Seven exhaled deeply and closed her eyes, distracted by the constant contact
of B'Elanna's wandering hands on her hair.</P>
<P>"I require a bobby pin," Seven managed to get out.</P>
<P>"A what?" </P>
<P>"A bobby pin. It is designed to hold my hair in a bun shape. A highly
efficient tool."</P>
<P>"No wonder I couldn't tie your hair together."</P>
<P>B'Elanna began to playfully flip and twirl Seven's hair.</P>
<P>"Where'd they even get the name bobby pin in the first place?"</P>
<P>"It has been my observation that humans tend to name inventions after
themselves, perhaps the person that created it was named Bobby."</P>
<P>"True, but it's still weird."</P>
<P>"If you prefer, you can simply refer to it as a hair pin."</P>
<P>"Now why didn't you just say that in the first place?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna threw up her hands, taking Seven's hair along for the ride.</P>
<P>"I was attempting to start some small talk."</P>
<P>"Oh," B'Elanna said, surprised that Seven would even waste her time starting
a useless conversation. </P>
<P>"You do not wish to small talk?" Seven asked, misreading B'Elanna's surprised
response.</P>
<P>"No, it's not that. It's just that I'm a little shocked that you would even
bother making irrelevant conversation."</P>
<P>B'Elanna began playing with Seven's hair again, taking it between two fingers
and sliding it through to the end. </P>
<P>"The Doctor has taught me that not all small talk is irrelevant."</P>
<P>"Really, and what kind would that be," B'Elanna teased, pulling lightly on
Seven's hair.</P>
<P>Seven hesitated, a little embarrassed about the answer she was going to
give.</P>
<P>"Relevant small talk involves the purpose of building a friendship," Seven
stated, hoping B'Elanna wouldn't read anything into it.</P>
<P>"So are you saying that you want to be my friend?"</P>
<P>Seven anticipated the question, but still found it hard to answer.</P>
<P>"In a manner of speaking," Seven tried to sound nonchalant. </P>
<P>"And what manner would that be? Yes or No?" B'Elanna pushed the obviously
flustered Borg.</P>
<P>"I believe yes."</P>
<P>"You believe, yes? Why don't you know?" B'Elanna continued on the
offensive.</P>
<P>"It has been my observation that you display an unusual hostility towards me
in particular," Seven stated, expecting another classic blow up.</P>
<P>"Oh." B'Elanna stopped her hair stroking, hurt at the accusation. "I… don't
know what to say, except that you're probably right?" B'Elanna felt a hollow
emptiness insider her chest. All these years she vented her anger towards Seven,
thinking that an automaton couldn't feel anything.</P>
<P>"I did not intend to hurt your feelings, Lieutenant." Seven tried to take
away the pain evident in B'Elanna's voice.</P>
<P>"No, that's okay. You're right, I've been such bitch to you ever since you
came aboard," B'Elanna laughed unconvincingly, placing a hand on Seven's good
shoulder.</P>
<P>"I was never offended," Seven reassured, gently placing her hand over
B'Elanna's. </P>
<P>"Thanks." B'Elanna's emptiness was filled with a warmth she had not know
since the alpha quadrant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Back on Voyager, Shuttle Bay One.</P>
<P>"How are the upgrades going, Tom?" Janeway asked, while casually strolling
into the shuttle bay, supply bag in hand.</P>
<P><BR>"Good, I just remodulated the shielding to protect against that
bio-electric field," Tom said happily, while sliding out from under the Delta
Flyer.</P>
<P>"That's good news, because I'm taking her out now," Janeway hefted the bag
into the ship.</P>
<P>"What?" Tom jumped to his feet.</P>
<P>"You heard me," Janeway said sternly. "You've been reassigned to stay on
Voyager, and pilot this ship home if anything happens to me down there."</P>
<P>"Since when?"</P>
<P>"Since now."</P>
<P>"Look, with all due respect Captain, I'm the best pilot on this ship, and
you're going to need me to get through that bio-electric turbulence."</P>
<P>"That's exactly why you're staying on Voyager. We've already got our
Astrometrics Officer, Chief Engineer, and Hydroponics Bay expert down there, we
don't need to lose our best pilot."<BR><BR>"Let me get this straight, you're
saying a pilot is worth more than the captain."<BR><BR>"Exactly," Janeway fixed
Tom with an aggravated look.</P>
<P>"Okay, I'm not even going to try to understand that logic, but my
girlfriend's down there, and I think I should be the one risking my life for
her. You know, the whole knight in shining armor thing, I'm told girls really
love that."</P>
<P>"Well, this time you're going to have to put your childish fantasy aside and
stay on this ship, understood, Lieutenant?" Janeway was one step away from
ordering Tom to get the hell out of the shuttle bay.</P>
<P>"Understood," Tom answered with his usual angry sarcasm when he didn't get
his way. "But I'm counting on you to bring back my fiancée in one piece," Tom's
anger slipped away, and gave the captain a knowing look.</P>
<P>"Fiancée, huh? I'll be sure to keep that quiet." Janeway smiled while
performing a zipping motion across her mouth.</P>
