<p>Thanks again to all my awesome reviewers - you're what keeps this story going. I figured I'd update way early today before I fall asleep/forget...so Happy Thanksgiving everyone and enjoy</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Chapter III</b></p>
<p>Miley would have skipped into the kitchen if her crutches didn't prevent it, but for once she didn't mind them so much, as it was Friday. This meant two and a half days to spend with Lilly and Miley smiled at the mere thought of her girlfriend. Her smile faltered, however, as soon as she entered the kitchen. Richard was sitting at the breakfast bar, reading a newspaper as if he were at home. Miley made a face, but nevertheless sat two stools down from him.</p>
<p>Richard looked up from his paper and smiled. "Good morning, Miley."</p>
<p>She mumbled something incoherent in return, but it was apparently good enough for him as he continued. "I made pancakes if you would like some."</p>
<p>"No, thanks," said Miley easily, though her eyes stayed glued to the stack of pancakes on the plate beside him a little too long.</p>
<p>"I know you like pancakes; I saw you devouring the ones Lilly made for you last week," said Richard and put his newspaper down to look at Miley more intensely.</p>
<p>Miley shrugged. "That's 'cause Lilly made them."</p>
<p>"And you think I poisoned these or something?" Even though Richard was obviously joking, there was an edge to his voice that nearly made Miley shiver.</p>
<p>"Did you?"</p>
<p>Richard laughed loudly as if she'd told the best joke ever and Susan chose that moment to enter the kitchen. She looked between her daughter and boyfriend, warily, especially once she noticed the clouded look on Miley's face. Richard shook his head, still chuckling as he turned to a confused Susan.</p>
<p>"Miley thinks I poisoned the pancakes."</p>
<p>Susan sighed and threw her daughter and exasperated look. "Miley, reallyâ€¦"</p>
<p>Miley had to give him credit for his craftiness; he always seemed to get her in trouble with her mom lately and this time she really hadn't said anything. She was trying to decide between appeasing her mom and eating the pancakes or just leaving and climbing the highest tree she could find, when Richard's cell phone saved her from having to make the decision. His eyes narrowed as he looked at the caller ID and Richard gave an apologetic smile to Susan before walking out. They could hear him yelling before the front door closed. Miley briefly wondered if he was involved in the mafia or a gang, something untoward she could use to get rid of him, but a plate stacked with pancakes was suddenly set down in front of her.</p>
<p>Miley looked at the pancakes and then up at her mother. "You want me to get fat, momma?"</p>
<p>"Well, hun, at least if you were fat, I wouldn't have to worry about you climbing trees anymore, now would I?"</p>
<p>Miley grinned. "I'd still find a way."</p>
<p>She took the bottle of Tabasco sauce her mother handed her and doused the pancakes. Susan walked around the breakfast bar and kissed the top of Miley's head tenderly. "I'm sure you would, sweet pea. Now eat your breakfast."</p>
<p>And in that moment, Miley felt like everything was alright with the world. Right until the front door opened and Richard walked back into the house.</p>
<p><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"Momma!"</p>
<p>Lilly winced at the volume of Miley's voice as she called for her mother. Miley made her way down the last two steps and looked around, before she noticed someone in the kitchen. She'd really gotten quite quick with the crutches and was in the kitchen in no time, Lilly on her heels.</p>
<p>Susan looked up from where she sat at the table, clipping coupons. She could tell by the look on Miley's face she was not going to like what came next.</p>
<p>"Momma, can I go with Lilly into town?" Miley was bouncing slightly, rocking back and forth on her crutches and Susan briefly wondered how it was she hadn't hurt herself any further since using them.</p>
<p>Remembering the question, she frowned. "This town or Murfreesboro?"</p>
<p>"Murfreesboro."</p>
<p>Susan threw a glance at the clock. "It's a little late, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"No," said Miley simply and Lilly was struck again by how different Miley's interaction with her mother and grandmother was compared to most other teens. There was never any begging, whining or bargaining and though Miley wasn't exactly known for following the rules laid down, she normally knew perfectly well what she could get away with.</p>
<p>"Lilly, what time do you have to be home?"</p>
<p>"Not 'till midnight on the weekend, Mrs. Stewart." Though she figured by now Susan knew her well enough, Lilly still tried to be extra polite and accommodating, perhaps to make up for whatever mischief Miley was sure to cause in her presence later on.</p>
<p>Susan seemed to contemplate for a while, but she knew she couldn't say 'no' to the excited look on Miley's face, especially considering how much time hyperactive Miley had been tied to a wheelchair. She sighed. "Okay, you can go. But I want you home by 11."</p>
<p>"Yes, momma," grinned Miley, already moving to leave.</p>
<p>Lilly hesitated and turned to Susan before following her girlfriend. "Don't worry, I'll try to keep her in check."</p>
<p>Susan smiled knowingly and nodded. "I know you will, Lilly. Have a good time."</p>
<p>By the time Lilly got outside, Miley was already in the passenger seat of the SUV, turning knobs on the console. Lilly hadn't even realized Miley had swiped her keys. She climbed into the driver's seat and tossed Miley the jacket she'd once again neglected to take. Miley grinned at her and Lilly couldn't help but return it. They pulled out of the driveway and down the path towards the main road. Miley was silent for once, staring out into the darkness.</p>
<p>"Are you gonna tell me why you talked me into driving all the way to Murfreesboro tonight?" asked Lilly, waiting for Miley turn and face her.</p>
<p>Miley offered her usual sheepish grin. "Richard is coming over for dinner."</p>
<p>Lilly suppressed a sigh as she shook her head, though her voice still held a hint of amusement. "So, you're just using me then?"</p>
<p>"No," said Miley, sounding almost put out. "I just like you better than Richard."</p>
<p>That was an understatement, Lilly knew, but she wasn't going to bring up Miley's intense dislike for her mother's boyfriend. She reached for Miley's hand and intertwined their fingers. "You better like me more than him; I'm your girlfriend."</p>
<p>Miley laughed and tugged on Lilly's hand. They were silent again for several minutes, while Miley shifted anxiously on her seat, hands searching every crack and crevice and fiddling with every knob. Lilly was about to somehow restrain her, when Miley pulled some glossy brochures from the space between the seat and console. She looked them over curiously and Lilly suddenly felt a tiny pang of dread.</p>
<p>"What's this?" Miley idly flipped through the brochures and then looked up at Lilly.</p>
<p>"Just some college brochures. You gotta start applying in Februaryâ€¦mom's pretty much been ordering brochures from every school she's ever heard of," said Lilly, trying to make it sound like it was no big deal. And maybe it really wasn't.</p>
<p>Miley was still browsing through the brochures. "Where are you gonna apply?"</p>
<p>Lilly couldn't read Miley at all, which was very unusual for her. "I don't know, yet. There's still time to decide."</p>
<p>Miley just nodded and tucked the brochures back into the crevice she'd found them in and turned back to look out of the window. Lilly wanted to say something, anything, but she wasn't even sure if something was wrong. They had never talked about what was going to happen when Lilly graduated High School in the spring. Lilly could have offered the customary, empty platitudes about how they'd go away to college together, but she didn't want to do that with Miley when they both knew it was a lie. Miley had already had a hard time with her home schooling because of her hyperactivity and adding the months she'd spent in a hospital or rehab facility, she was now close to a year behind Lilly.</p>
<p>"Are we going to the Chinese place?"</p>
<p>Miley's voice startled Lilly out of her reverie and she chanced a quick glance at her girlfriend. She still could not tell what Miley was feeling and it irked her to feel so clueless. She nodded, trying to force a smile, but she was sure it looked like anything but. "Of course."</p>
<p>Miley did smile, loving and open as always, before she turned back to the window and Lilly had to swallow the lump suddenly in her throat.</p>
<p><b>xxx</b></p>
<p>"Miley. Miley, stop." Lilly sat up almost abruptly, forcing Miley's wandering hands out from under her shirt. Miley gave her an odd look. They were both breathing heavily and Lilly's heart was thundering, though she wasn't sure whether it was from the heavy make-out session or what she had seen outside the SUV's window.</p>
<p>"I've got ten minutes, Lils," said Miley, not understanding why her girlfriend had stopped her so suddenly, especially when things were just getting heated. She snuck her hands back under Lilly's shirt, her fingertips brushing the delicate skin teasingly. Lilly grabbed Miley's wrists, stopping their ministrations and nodded towards the house.</p>
<p>"Miley, Richard's there."</p>
<p>Miley's head snapped around and she looked out the window at the house. It was mostly dark outside, safe the weak light coming from a half moon, but now the porch light was on and she could easily see Richard leaning against the railing, a mug in his hand. She knew he couldn't see them, they had turned off all the SUV's lights and its windows were tinted, but a shudder ran through her nonetheless. Miley slid off of Lilly's lap.</p>
<p>"I don't like him," said Miley, her voice no longer playful. Lilly sighed, but decided not to get into an argument over how benign someone enjoying the cool night air on the porch really was. She ran her hands through Miley's now wildly out of place hair and straightened the girl's clothes.</p>
<p>Lilly kissed Miley soundly on the lips. "It's almost 11, anyway. You don't wanna make your mom mad."</p>
<p>"But we weren't done," said Miley, sighing heavily as if she had been dealt a huge injustice.</p>
<p>"We've got all day tomorrow to do <b>whatever</b> you want, Road kill," said Lilly trying to appease, looking right into Miley's eyes.</p>
<p>Miley grinned mischievously, the interruption all but forgotten. "<b>Whatever</b> I want?"</p>
<p>Lilly nodded and leaned forward again to kiss her girlfriend. "Yup. You better make it count, Miles."</p>
<p>"Oh, I will," said Miley seriously, but the sparkle in her eyes gave her away. She was just a hair away from outright grinning. Lilly chuckled. She liked it much better when she could read her girlfriend.</p>
<p>Lilly grabbed the crutches from the floor of the SUV and pushed open the door to the backseat. Miley stole another quick kiss before she swung her legs out of the car, grabbed her crutches and hopped out into the darkness. She threw Lilly one last grin. "I love you, Lilly."</p>
<p>"And I love you back, Road kill," said Lilly softly and watched as Miley made her way towards the front of the house. Lilly climbed back into the driver's seat and drove off as soon as she saw Miley reach the porch.</p>
<p>Miley knew Richard was watching her slow progress towards the house and all the happy feelings from just a minute ago were replaced with the sense of mistrust and enmity she normally felt around him. She reached the bottom of the steps and looked up at him, not trying to hide her dislike. Richard's face, however, was a mask of neutrality. He sipped from his steaming mug as Miley slowly ascended the stairs.</p>
<p>"Where's momma?" asked Miley as she reached the top, her voice suspicious.</p>
<p>Richard didn't meet her eyes, focusing instead on the vast darkness spread out in front of them. "She's inside. She was worried you and Lilly were up to no good out here and asked me to put a stop to it."</p>
<p>He turned his intense eyes on her at the end and Miley narrowed her eyes. "Momma wouldn't do that."</p>
<p>Richard laughed, as if nothing could disturb him. "Wouldn't she?"</p>
<p>"I could tell her you're spying on me," said Miley, not sure whether they were still talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>He nodded, looking back down into his mug, before meeting her eyes again. "You could, but you won't."</p>
<p>Miley was about to respond but he straightened himself and held up a hand. "How about we both pretend we didn't see anything and just go inside?"</p>
<p>Richard didn't wait for an answer. He walked to the front door, leaving Miley no choice but to follow.</p>
