<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Twenty -->

<p>Charlotte Grayson was not a happy woman.</p>
		<p>It had been two weeks since she had brought her talented young client home. Twelve days of which the blonde had been on the move, racing from city to city on a self-imposed, non stop book-signing tour.</p>
		<p>"I've got obligations," the blonde insisted when she requested, no, demanded this schedule. "I lost two months sitting on my ass. If I don't make that up now, I never will."</p>
		<p>And off she went. Owning up to her 'obligations.'</p>
		<p>
			<i>"Bullshit! She's running. Running from that talk we were supposed to have. Running from whatever happened up on that damn mountain. Running from
				<b>herself</b>. Well that stops today, my friend. You didn't know I could cancel appearances that fast, did you? I hated to pull rank and drag you back here like that, but you left me no choice. Something happened between you and doctor Oakes and neither one of you will talk about it. But whatever it is, it's affecting you both.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Charlotte recalled a disturbing conversation she'd had last week.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Hello?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Dr. Oakes?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yes. Who is this?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Dr. Oakes, my name is Charlotte Grayson. I'm Megan Galagher's publisher.</p>
		<p>
			<b>? "Is she?is everything all right?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Megan is fine, Dr. Oakes. Thank you for asking. Actually I'm just in the process of cutting you a check for your services in regard to my client, and I was just wondering if you would like to have a check sent to you, or would you like to have the amount wired directly to your bank account?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Mrs. Grayson, I've told Ms. Galagher and I'll tell you; I do not need, require, or desire any payment for my 'services.' If Ms. Galagher is so determined to write a check, then make it out to the Pediatric Aids Foundation. They need it a great deal more than I do."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I see. Dr. Oakes, may I speak openly for a moment?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Please do."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Megan is, physically, doing quite well. And that is due in no small part to the excellent care she received from you. But something is troubling her, Dr. Oakes. Something she cannot, or will not, talk about. When I picked her up in Cutters Gap, I could tell right then that something was wrong. But she refused to talk about it at that time; promising that she would when we got back to New York. However, when we got back, she went directly to her apartment and stayed there for two days. Not communicating with anyone. The next thing I knew, she blew into my office insisting on an immediate whirlwind book signing tour. Stating that she needed to make up for the ones she missed while she was incapacitated. Needless to say, she got her way. I suppose that, as her publisher, I should be happy that she's back in the saddle, so to speak. But, as her friend, I'm concerned. She's changed, Dr. Oakes. There's an aura of gentle pain that surrounds her now; so profound that it would make a statue weep. Try as she might to disguise it, she cannot. Now, this was not the sense I got when I spoke to her on the phone two days prior to picking her up. At that time she was in fairly good spirits. Something happened in between those times, Dr. Oakes, and I'm dearly hoping that you can tell me what it was."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I'm afraid I can't do that, Ms. Grayson. That is information that you'll have to get directly from Ms. Galagher. I admit to being surprised though, at your perception of sorrow from your client. I would have expected anger."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Why would you expect anger, Dr. Oakes?" Did something?did you??"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"No, Ms. Grayson, I would never violate my patient's trust like that."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Then what??"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"As I said, I can't go into that with you. Suffice it to say she is angry. And it's entirely my fault. My?failure. And I'm more sorry than I can ever express.</b>
		</p>
		<p>"You care for her, don't you?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Very much so. She's a special woman, Ms. Grayson. We didn't hit it off very well at first, as I'm sure you know. But in the time we spent together, I discovered that beneath the prickly exterior I first encountered, there was a sweet, warm, lovely young woman.</b>
		</p>
		<p>"And do you know why she has that 'prickly exterior'?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yes I do. And it shames me to say that I am yet another who's let her down."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I see. And you won't provide me any more detail than that?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"No ma'am, I'm sorry. Please, talk to her. It will not only answer your questions, but it may also help her if she gets it off her chest."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I'll most certainly do that, Dr. Oakes. Before I go, are you sure you will not take any payment?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I'm positive. As trite as it may sound, just having her here, and getting to know her was worth a great deal more than any money you could offer."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Very well, Doctor. Is there anything you would like me to tell her for you?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Tell her I?"</b> There was a weighty pause, then,
			<b>"no, there isn't."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Very well. Thank you again, Doctor Oakes?for everything."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You're welcome."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"And, Doctor?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yes?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Be well. Somehow I sense that my headstrong young client is not the only one in pain."</p>
		<p>A hoarsely whispered 'thank you' was all she heard before the click that ended the call.</p>
		<p>
			<i>"A disturbing but very informative phone call," </i> the older woman mused.
			<i> "Methinks the good doctor is smitten with the fair-haired young bard. Now the question or questions of the day are,</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>1) Does Megan know?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>2) If she does know is that what she's angry or sad about?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>3) Or is she completely unaware, and simply missing the new friend she had made. That would explain her melancholy. But that wouldn't explain why Dr. Oakes thinks she would be mad. Nor does is explain what I saw when we were leaving the store.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>"Or am I just a doddering old woman who's watched too many soap operas?" </i> the publisher chuckled to herself.
		</p>
		<p>Hearing a light tap on her door, she turned to find her Administrative Assistant's head poking in.</p>
		<p>"Ms. Galagher's here," the portly brunette announced softly, then, looking back over her shoulder, she added, "and she's not a happy camper."</p>
		<p>"Big surprise there," the older woman snorted. "Send her in and I'll build a little fire and roast her some marshmallows."</p>
		<p>"I'll send her in," the Admin snickered. "But I don't think you'll need to build a fire. Just hold them over her head for a few seconds." With that, she left.</p>
		<p>"Now," the older woman clapped her hands together and took her seat. "Let's see about getting some answers to those questions."</p>
		<p>No sooner had those words left her lips when her door flew open and in walked one livid writer.</p>
		<p>"All right, Charly, what in the hell's going on here?" she barked.</p>
		<p>"Hello Megan. I'm fine, thank you for asking," she replied, keeping her voice deliberately calm. "And what do you mean, what's going on here?"</p>
		<p>"You know goddamn well what I mean!" the blonde spat, slamming both palms on the desk. "You canceled my signing appearances and sent orders that I had to return immediately to see you. I don't know what in the hell you're playing at, Charly, but I'm not in the mood."</p>
		<p>"Are you quite finished?" the older woman inquired calmly.</p>
		<p>"No, I'm?"</p>
		<p>"Oh yes, you are," the older growled, rising from her chair and, at 6'2", towering over her petite client. "You are going to calm down, sit down, and stop behaving like a spoiled two-year-old. Because if you don't you're gonna find yourself signing books in places like Bumfuck Arkansas from now until the end of your contract."</p>
		<p>"You wouldn't," the blonde squeaked, goggle-eyed.</p>
		<p>The older woman leaned forward until she was just about nose-to-nose with her client. "Try me, little girl."</p>
		<p>The publisher's face was a study in steely determination and the blonde knew, without a doubt the she could, and indeed would, do exactly what she had threatened.</p>
		<p>With her high fury properly deflated, the writer meekly lowered herself into a chair. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened them again, her publisher friend was once again seated, a benign smile playing across her lips.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Charly."</p>
		<p>"It's all right, hon."</p>
		<p>"No, it's not," the blonde replied sheepishly. "I acted like an ass."</p>
		<p>"No, like a two-year-old," the publisher contradicted with an amused grin.</p>
		<p>The blonde blushed prettily. "Touché." Then sobering, she added, "I don't know what's gotten into me lately. I seem to be snapping at a lot of people."</p>
		<p>"Hmm," the older woman agreed. "Either snapping at them?or avoiding them altogether."</p>
		<p>The blonde blinked owlishly, her mouth opened, as if to refute, then snapped shut.</p>
		<p>"It seems you've been avoiding everyone that knows you." The publisher snorted, "Hell, even lover boy called here bitching. It seems he's been trying to get a hold of you, but you're never home and won't return his calls. Of course I won't fault you for that," the older woman grinned devilishly, then sobered. "You can't keep running forever, honey."</p>
		<p>"I'm not running," the blonde returned weakly, unable to meet the older woman's eyes.</p>
		<p>"Yes, you are?and you know it," the older woman got up and walked around the desk. Sitting in the chair next to her friend, she reached over and cupped her chin, raising the bowed head until shuttered green eyes met hers. "You haven't been the same since you left Cutters Gap. Something happened between you and the doctor, Megan, and I'd like to know what it was. Because whatever it was, it's hurt both of you."</p>
		<p>Megan pulled from the hand that cupped her chin, once again avoiding the older woman's penetrating gaze.</p>
		<p>"What makes you think something happened?"</p>
		<p>"Because you looked like hell when I picked you up Sunday, which is quite different from how I pictured you when I talked to you Friday night. Because the
			<b>Randi</b> you talked about Friday night, suddenly became
			<b>Dr. Oakes</b> again Sunday afternoon. Because the young woman who propelled herself into the car and attached herself to me like her life depended on it fairly vibrated with extreme angst. And finally, because that same young woman, who's normally a pretty talkative sort, didn't part with even ten whole sentences on the entire trip back home." Charly reached over and gently clasped the writer's chin, an indulgent smile gracing her lips. "Now, I'm no Samantha Steele, but there are some clues that even I can catch."
		</p>
		<p>That earned her a small grin before she returned to studying her hands. "It's nothing really, Charly,"</p>
		<p>The older woman leaned back, spreading her arms in a 'so what' gesture. "If it's nothing, hon, then there's no harm in the telling now, is there?"</p>
		<p>The blonde looked up, a wry grin creasing her lips. "I'm not gonna get out of this, am I?"</p>
		<p>"Nope."</p>
		<p>"It's not real pretty."</p>
		<p>The older woman's smile faded somewhat. "All the more reason you should talk about it. Just answer me one question first," somber brown studied the younger woman's face intently. "Did she?.do anything to??"</p>
		<p>A guilty flush crept up her cheeks. "No, Charly," her voice was almost a whisper, "I did."</p>
		<p>The publisher leaned back.
			<i> "Whoa!" </i> Quickly recovering her composure, she rose from the desk.
		</p>
		<p>"Oookay, I think this is going to require a good, strong coffee."</p>
