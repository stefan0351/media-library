<!-- She Who Hesitates Is Lost \ Chapter 26 Tempting fate -->

<P>Kathryn Janeway sat at her desk in her ready room studying the data on the
gravitational river. It was an amazing piece of deduction on Seven’s part. She
had figured out how to use the gravity currents with only a smattering of
evidence left behind by the previous ships. Janeway admitted to herself that
while she may have figured it out eventually, it would have taken her far longer
than it had taken Seven. She looked up when the ready room door chime sounded.
</P>
<P>"Come in," she ordered. The doors hissed open and B’Elanna Torres walked in.
</P>
<P>"Captain? You asked to see me?" B’Elanna walked over and stood in front of
Janeway’s desk. </P>
<P>"Yes. Thank you for coming so quickly. I know you’ve been working overtime in
engineering to get things ready." Janeway pointed to the chair next to Torres.
"Have a seat, please." </P>
<P>"Yes, ma’am, we’re almost finished." B’Elanna sat, keeping her back straight.
</P>
<P>"Relax, B’Elanna." Janeway smiled. "I’m not checking up on you. I just wanted
to thank you for all the extra effort you’ve put in on this. I know you haven’t
had much time off to get acclimated to being back on board." </P>
<P>"We’re fine," B’Elanna said, unconsciously mentioning Seven anytime she
thought about her own well being; their fates were completely intertwined. </P>
<P>"Glad to hear it." Janeway smiled. She caught the plural reference. "You both
certainly look well." Kathryn ran her fingers through he own hair, and nodded
toward B’Elanna. "That’s a good look on you." </P>
<P>B’Elanna blushed. "Seven likes it long." </P>
<P>"She’s done a great job on the gravitational river. I’m impressed." Kathryn
leaned back and studied B’Elanna. She looked fabulous. </P>
<P>"Seven was happy to help," B’Elanna said, unaware that her eyes sparkled when
she said her wife’s name. </P>
<P>"I’m happy for the two of you," Kathryn said sincerely. "You’re a good
match." </P>
<P>"Thank you." B’Elanna decided that there was no time like the present. Seven
couldn’t possibly be mad at her…It wasn’t like she had approached the captain.
Janeway brought it up. "Captain, there’s something I’d like to talk you about.
Off the record… it’s a personal matter." </P>
<P>"All right." Kathryn leaned forward and rested her chin on her closed fist.
</P>
<P>"Umm," B’Elanna said as she looked around the ready room, not quite sure how
to start. "This is really hard. Captain... Kathryn..." B’Elanna looked into the
older woman’s eyes to see if she would balk at the use of her first name. </P>
<P>"Go ahead, B’Elanna." Janeway smiled disarmingly. </P>
<P>"Thank you. Kathryn, I don’t want this to sound...possessive, or defensive or
confrontational..." B’Elanna realized this was going to be much harder than she
had first thought. </P>
<P>"What is it?" Kathryn’s eyes were completely sincere, and her face showed
honest concern. "Just say it." </P>
<P>"Okay." B’Elanna sighed. "I just want you to know that I appreciate the
support you’ve shown Seven and I... Despite your feelings for her." </P>
<P>Kathryn raised both eyebrows, but didn’t deny it. Inside she was panicking,
she had tried so hard to keep her feelings hidden. Obviously she hadn’t done a
very good job. </P>
<P>"Seven and I both care a great deal for you," B’Elanna continued. "I’m so
sorry that you...that you are hurting." </P>
<P>"Hey," Kathryn said quietly. "Don’t ever apologize for being happy." She
leaned back and shook her head, then smiled ruefully. "I can’t say that I am
happy I was so obvious, but I can promise you that I am happy for you both."
</P>
<P>"You’re not obvious," B’Elanna assured her. "It’s just that I recognize what
you feel." </P>
<P>"Yes, I guess you would," Kathryn conceded. "I hope this doesn’t interfere
with our friendship, B’Elanna. I assure you, I have complete respect for your
relationship." </P>
<P>"Kathryn, I know that." B’Elanna stood and walked around the desk and leaned
against it, facing Kathryn. "That’s why I wanted to talk to you. You have been a
wonderful friend, mentor, and champion for me, and Seven. She considers you one
of her best friends, and I’d hate to see her lose that. I don’t want to lose
your friendship either." </P>
<P>"That won’t happen." Kathryn smiled up at B’Elanna. "It helps that you’re
both so happy. I’m happy for you. I’ve never seen either of you so... so..."
Kathryn searched for the right word. </P>
<P>"Complete?" B’Elanna offered. </P>
<P>"Yes, complete." Kathryn stood. "If either of you need anything, just ask. I
mean that." </P>
<P>"We will," B’Elanna said as she stood. "Oh, which reminds me, after we get
through the dark matter field... we might need a little time off." She smiled
shyly. </P>
<P>"You’ve earned it," Janeway said. "After all, that away mission was a bit
longer than expected. You’re overdue for about three months of leave." </P>
<P>"I think we’ll save some of that time off for after the baby," B’Elanna said
as Kathryn walked her to the door. </P>
<P>"Good enough. That’ll give you time to train a replacement for your absence."
Kathryn smiled, but inside, she ached, the mention of the baby another reminder
of what she didn’t have. </P>
<P>"Thanks, captain," B’Elanna said as she walked onto the bridge. Janeway
smiled and waved as the Klingon went to the turbolift<I>. "Well, that was easy.
Now I just have to talk to Tom,"</I> B’Elanna thought. <BR></P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Finding Tom only required one question to the computer. He was in his
quarters, and B’Elanna considered waiting until he was in a more public
location, but then realized that he might not be as belligerent without an
audience. She stood in front of his door for a moment before activating the
chime.</P>
<P>Tom was sitting on his couch eating dinner and watching the television that
B’Elanna had constructed for him. He looked at the door when the chime
sounded.</P>
<P>"Go away," he yelled.</P>
<P>"Tom, open the door. We have to talk," B’Elanna responded through the closed
door. She knew how to override his privacy code. In fact, he probably hadn’t
changed it since they had been together. She had changed hers as soon as she
broke up with him.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna?" he said as he jumped up. ‘<I>She finally came to her senses,</I>’
he thought as he went to the door, pausing to smooth his hair with both hands.
"Come in," he said as the door opened. He gave her a charming smile. "Guess you
missed me, huh?"</P>
<P>"Tom…" B’Elanna rolled her eyes, but he took it as a playful gesture instead
of recognizing it as exasperation.</P>
<P>"Lana, I really like your hair like that. I love the way you tie it so far
down your back…it makes it look, Klingon…wild. I’ll bet it feels great." He
stepped closer and reached for her ponytail.</P>
<P>She knocked his hand away as she stepped back. "What part of ‘<I>I am
married’</I> do you not understand?" </P>
<P>"Lana, you were trapped on a planet, all alone. I understand you were…lonely,
and hey, she is hot, but…"</P>
<P>"Tom, I’m trying to be civil, but you’re making it really difficult not to
kick your ass." B’Elanna walked over and looked at the TV. The sound was muted
but she recognized the program, Buck Rogers.</P>
<P>"All that hostility?" Tom asked with a smirk. "There must be some feelings
left if I still get under your skin." </P>
<P>He was so smug it took all of B’Elanna’s strength to keep from smacking the
half smile off of his face. </P>
<P>"Paris, I came to talk to you because, believe or not I do care, as a friend.
You’re making a complete ass of yourself, which is pitiful, but not my business.
You are also harassing my wife. That is my business. I won’t put up with
that."</P>
<P>"Okay…" Tom stopped and studied B’Elanna. He realized Seven must have done
quite a number on her to have her acting so… well, so married. He decided to
switch tactics. "So, is that all you came to say? Do you think we can still be
friends, Lana?" He gave her his wounded puppy look.</P>
<P>"That’s up to you, Tom. I love Seven. She’s my life, and I won’t let anyone
or anything hurt her. I’d rather die… or kill." B’Elanna rubbed her hand,
massaging the palm. She had calluses on her hands from the tools she hadn’t used
in years. On the planet, she used different tools every day, but none quite like
the ones in engineering, and not for the long hours she had used them earlier in
the day.</P>
<P>"B’Elanna, I want to work this out, okay?" He looked over his shoulder. "Can
you give me a second, I need to splash some water on my face. I just climbed out
of a Jeffrey’s tube. I was reinforcing the bridge structural integrity fields
all afternoon. Give me a minute, okay?"</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said as she sat on the edge of the couch. "I’ve been
crawling around them myself. I feel like I’m covered in grime." She was perched
on the edge of the cushion, still not comfortable relaxing.</P>
<P>Tom smiled, not believing how lucky he was, and then hurried into his
bathroom, splashed water onto his face and quickly dried off. He opened the
medicine cabinet and took out a small jar of salve. He looked over his shoulder
and then smelled the medicine and rubbed some onto his thumb. He carefully
closed the jar without smudging his thumb and hurried back to the living
room.</P>
<P>"Lana, I’m sorry I’ve been so… difficult." He moved over to the couch, but
before he could sit next to her, she stood.</P>
<P>"Tom, can’t you just try to be happy for me?" B’Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I’m trying," he said. He crinkled his brow, frowning as he studied her
neck.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna rubbed her neck self-consciously.</P>
<P>"Grime," he said as he reached out and used his thumb to rub her throat just
under the ear. "There, got it." He smiled. "I really should finish my dinner.
Janeway’s got me pulling a double. I guess I asked for it."</P>
<P>"Just try to be nice, Tom. I know you’ve got it in you." B’Elanna moved
toward the door. "I’m glad you still like the TV."</P>
<P>"You kidding? I love it," he said as she opened the door. "Thanks, Lana," he
said as she left.</P>
<P>"Be nice," she said again as she went down the corridor<I>. ‘I really have
the hang of these sensitive talks,’</I> she thought as she headed back to
engineering.</P>
<P>Tom went into the bathroom and washed his hands. He looked down at his thumb,
which was turning purple, and smiled. "Now for a little chat with the Borg," he
said to the mirror.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven was in Astrometrics when she heard the door open. She turned to see Tom
Paris coming toward her and she stood to her full height.</P>
<P>"Ensign Paris, if you are here for the course corrections, I have already
sent them to the bridge." Seven was not in the mood to put up with his antics.
Her back was aching and she was exhausted even after she had taken a short
nap.</P>
<P>"I just came to see if you had anything I should know about before I report
to the bridge for the beta shift," Tom said as circled her. </P>
<P>"You were on the alpha shift," Seven pointed out.</P>
<P>"Janeway thought I could use a double." He moved in front of Seven, blocking
her view of the console.</P>
<P>"You are disturbing my work. Please move." Seven wondered what B’Elanna would
say if she talked to him about his attitude, then decided she would not break
her promise to B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"Sorry," he said as he moved aside. "It must be hard for you."</P>
<P>Seven looked at him and raised an eyebrow. </P>
<P>"You know, being back here, with everyone. It’s not just you and Lana
anymore," he explained.</P>
<P>"We are adapting, Ensign." Seven wanted to choke him for calling her wife
‘Lana.’</P>
<P>"Yes," he smiled broadly, then leered at Seven. "I’m glad to see that you’re
so…open minded."</P>
<P>"Explain," Seven demanded. She was tired of his games.</P>
<P>"Oh," he said, suddenly looking like he had ruined some surprise, or revealed
something he shouldn’t have. "I…I thought you and Lana had an open relationship.
I mean, when she came by to…visit me this afternoon, I thought…well never
mind."</P>
<P>"Explain," she demanded again. "What is an ‘open relationship?’"</P>
<P>"Never mind. I really should be going. Tell Lana I really enjoyed
our…conversation this afternoon." He moved toward the door. "If you have
anything new, send it up to the bridge."</P>
<P>Seven glared at him as he left. She didn’t like him coming to her department
and didn’t believe he was being truthful about the reason for being there. She
closed her console and logged off for the day.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B’Elanna hurried home after her shift, eager to see Seven. She missed her
wife, and she was a bit confused by the glances and giggles she kept getting
from her crew. She wanted to go to her quarters and fall into bed…with
Seven.</P>
<P>"Hey, I missed you," B’Elanna said as she came through the door. Seven was
resting on the couch with her feet up.</P>
<P>"And I missed you, Be’nal." Seven sat up and smiled at B’Elanna. </P>
<P>"You look tired," B’Elanna said with a frown. "Are you working too hard?" She
sat next to Seven and lifted the exdrone’s feet onto her lap and began rubbing
her calves.<BR></P>
<P>"I <I>am</I> tired," Seven said as she leaned back into the couch. She sighed
as B’Elanna worked the tension out of her legs. She had forgotten how many hours
she used to spend on her feet. On the planet, when they were on their feet they
were walking through the dense forest, not standing in one place on the hard
deck plating.</P>
<P>"Seven, I’m getting scared, you shouldn’t be this tired." B’Elanna ran her
hand up Seven’s leg then detoured to her hand and squeezed it.</P>
<P>"I am fine." Seven yawned.</P>
<P>"Okay," B’Elanna said, not quite convinced. "How about some dinner?"</P>
<P>"Okay," Seven said as she sat up.</P>
<P>"We can eat here tonight. You rest," B’Elanna ordered.</P>
<P>"I will rest later," Seven said as she pulled her legs around and she leaned
over and kissed B’Elanna’s cheek. "I have not welcomed you home. Come here," she
ordered in a husky whisper.</P>
<P>B’Elanna turned her head and welcomed Seven’s lips. The kiss started slow,
with tender bites, and tongues tracing lips before entering. Seven shifted her
weight and draped herself across B’Elanna’s lap as the Klingon took control of
the embrace. B’Elanna moaned into Seven’s mouth as her tongue massaged Seven’s
and her hands moved across the prone former Borg’s chest. </P>
<P>"I thought you were tired," B’Elanna said when she pulled away for a
breath.</P>
<P>"I am never too tired to properly greet my wife," Seven explained.</P>
<P>"I love you," B’Elanna whispered and gave Seven a quick kiss on the
forehead.</P>
<P>"I am glad," Seven said. "I love you too." She suddenly frowned, considering
her talk with Tom Paris. "B’Elanna? What is an ‘open relationship?’ Does it mean
that we are completely honest with each other?"</P>
<P>B’Elanna stared down at Seven, shocked. "What are you talking about?"</P>
<P>"Tom Paris came by Astrometrics," Seven said. "He said you talked with him,
and that he believed we had an ‘open relationship.’ I assumed, given our level
of trust, that must have been what he meant."</P>
<P>"I’ll kill him." B’Elanna’s face contorted with rage. "That bastard."</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"An open relationship means that a couple agrees to take lovers," B’Elanna
said with her teeth clinched.</P>
<P>"Why would he think that?" Seven stood up and stretched, trying to get the
kink out of her back.</P>
<P>"I’m sure he didn’t. He probably thought he could start trouble between us."
B’Elanna stood and moved over and took Seven by the shoulders, looking her in
the eyes. "What else did he say?"</P>
<P>"Nothing of consequence," Seven said. She tilted her head and then concern
filled her eyes. "You are injured." She reached out and touched B’Elanna’s neck.
There was a small purple mark on her neck.</P>
<P>"What?" B’Elanna rubbed her throat.</P>
<P>Seven leaned over and studied it, then gently ran her fingers over it. Her
Borg enhanced eye zoomed in on the skin and she noted that it was not a
contusion at all. Rage filled her eyes and she took a deep breath.</P>
<P>"I know precisely why he said what he did," Seven said. She gently took
B’Elanna by the arm and led her to the bathroom and pointed out the mark.</P>
<P>B’Elanna’s eyes widened as she saw what looked like a well placed hickey. "I…
I…I never! I swear."</P>
<P>"Of course you did not," Seven said. "He obviously caused this mark in some
manner other than using his mouth."</P>
<P>"It’s that easy for you?" B’Elanna’s eyes filled with tears. "You just
believe me like that?" She was furious with Tom, but Seven’s complete faith
melted her heart. She wondered if she could be as trusting if Seven came home
sporting a hickey. She hoped so.</P>
<P>"I believe <I>in</I> you, in <I>us</I>, and I know our hearts are bonded."
Seven rubbed the mark in question. "Besides, I am familiar with your hickeys…
they do not discolor in this manner."</P>
<P>B’Elanna laughed. She loved when Seven, the prim and proper former Borg
drone, used words like hickey.</P>
<P>"But," Seven said. "I will deal with Ensign Paris. It is obvious he assaulted
you in some manner." Her eyes turned cold, and B’Elanna remember the men in the
cell, the vacant looks in their lifeless eyes.</P>
<P>"I’ll take care of him," B’Elanna said. "But this time, I won’t
be…diplomatic."</P>
<P>"He hurt you," Seven stated, her voice quivering with the rage she held in
check. The more she thought about it, the more angry she became.</P>
<P>"Hey," B’Elanna said as she pulled Seven to her. "He didn’t even touch me. I
don’t know how he…" B’Elanna closed her eyes and sighed, and she remembered him
touching her neck, right where the mark was. She also remembered the stares and
giggles when she returned to engineering after her talk with him. "That
bastard."</P>
<P>"What?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>B’Elanna pulled away and went to the other room and found her tricorder under
a stack of padds. She went to Seven and held it out. "Scan me." She handed it to
Seven.</P>
<P>Seven raised an eyebrow and carefully lifted B’Elanna’s chin, her fingers
warm against the Klingon’s skin. "There are traces of an organic compound. I am
not familiar with it." She handed the tricorder back to B’Elanna.</P>
<P>"I know this," B’Elanna said as she looked at it and tried to remember what
it was. She went to the comm panel and downloaded the data to the main computer.
"Computer, identify this compound… common name."</P><I>
<P>*"Working,"*</I> the computer responded and chirped as it processed the data.
<I>*"The compound is the synthetic form of Vulcan athletic balm."*</P></I>
<P>B’Elanna turned to Seven. "Vulcan athletic balm is used to help bring blood
to an injured muscle. If it’s used full strength, on a non Vulcan species, it
draws the blood to the surface, leaving a bruise."</P>
<P>Seven’s rage returned. "Is it dangerous?" she demanded.</P>
<P>"No," B’Elanna said as she shook her head.</P>
<P>"Then I will not have to kill him," Seven said. She was not making a
joke.</P>
