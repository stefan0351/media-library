<p>Disclaimer: Wait, you mean I <u>don't</u> own She's the Man? Damn! Well, thats it, my dreams are gone.</p>
<hr size=1 noshade><p>Viola tugged me into the hallway, pausing for just a moment, before heading towards a door just a little ways down the hall to our left. She threw it open and pulled me inside, but stopped short when she saw what we had interrupted. There were two people wrapped around each other on the bed looking at us with bleary, drunk expressions. Viola mumbled a short apology and slipped back into the hall. She still didn't slow her pace however, and continued to drag me towards the next closest room. This one she opened a bit more carefully but once she was sure it was unoccupied she hauled me inside and slammed the door. I saw her hand slide down and discretely turn the lock. Sure that we would not be disturbed, she turned to face me.</p>
<p>For a moment we just stared at each other, both waiting for the other to speak, and it sure as hell wasn't going to be me. My mind was racing uncontrollably. What had just happened was beyond amazing, even more amazing than anything I had ever imagined. And yes, I admit it; I had had countless daydreams about the green-eyed girl, most of which featured her in less than appropriate attire (if any at all) doing some fairly questionable things to my person. But unfortunately my imagination had never been able to capture the pure heated bliss I had just experienced in that moment. Did I want her to do it again? Hell yes. The question was, did she?</p>
<p>As expected, Viola was the first to speak. Her words were steady and her eyes never left mine.</p>
<p>"Truth or dare?"</p>
<p>This totally threw me off. Was she just going to completely ignore what had just happened? Push it off as some game spurred on by alcohol? Because there was no way I could do that.</p>
<p>"Olivia, truth or dare?"</p>
<p>Her use of my name snapped me out of my confused trance, but did not help me understand. But just as I was about to open my mouth to question her, she said sharply,</p>
<p>"Just answer the question."</p>
<p>"Truth." I said. I had never been big on dares.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, as if compiling her thoughts and spoke.</p>
<p>"Did you mean to kiss me like that?"</p>
<p>I frowned. Dare I say yes and risk our friendship? Or say no and continue to hide my feelings? The way things were going she would find out sooner or later and I was done concealing my emotions, I couldn't live a lie any longer.</p>
<p>"Yes." I said in a small voice, wanting to look away, but captivated, as always, by the intensity of her gaze. I tried desperately to read her expression, but even though Viola was one of the most expressive people I knew, she could me completely unreadable if she wanted to.</p>
<p>She nodded slowly, although I couldn't tell what it meant.</p>
<p>"Your turn." She said casually.</p>
<p><i>Right, my turn.</i></p>
<p>"Truth or dare?"</p>
<p>"Truth."</p>
<p>Hm, what did I want to know? Well that was obvious wasn't it?</p>
<p>"Did you mean to kiss me back?"</p>
<p>The response was instantaneous.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat. But she didn't let me ponder in silence for too long.</p>
<p>"Truth or dare?"</p>
<p>I decided to play it safe one more time.</p>
<p>"Um, truth."</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes playfully, which certainly did lighten the mood.</p>
<p>"How long have you wanted to do that?"</p>
<p>I blushed, and looked at my feet.</p>
<p>"How long?" She asked again, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.</p>
<p>"Since the first time I met you. Remember, that day out side the principal's office? I had never met a guy with that much interest in shoes!"</p>
<p>Viola chuckled at the memory, "Of course! How could I forget? I was such a wreck."</p>
<p>"Yep," I said, laughing along with her. "Then you rushed off to take care of your 'guy stuff', it was so cute!"</p>
<p>"Well, I was having my bravado totally skewered by this random hot blond girl! I could barely think straight, let alone get out a coherent sentence."</p>
<p>I blushed at her "hot blond girl" comment, and decided to get back to the game.</p>
<p>"Truth or dare?"</p>
<p>She thought for a moment. "Truth."</p>
<p>Copying her previous actions I rolled my eyes and sighed playfully. She slapped me lightly on the arm, but her eyes were laughing. Gosh, she was so beautiful.</p>
<p>Thinking for a moment, I said, "Why did you kiss me if you said you had a crush on somebody else?"</p>
<p>Viola's expression instantly changed, taking on a much more serious look, she took a step forward, my body instantly reacting to her closeness.</p>
<p>"Who said it was somebody else?"</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my ears, a thrill shot though my stomach and I suddenly felt a bit light headed.</p>
<p>"Truth or dare?" She asked, taking another step towards me.</p>
<p>"Dare." I said quietly.</p>
<p>"Kiss me." She breathed, and we closed the distance between us once more.</p>
