<!-- Charming Faith \ Prologue -->

<p>Cold... it was cold.</p>

<p>Why was it so cold? She was in fucking California.</p>

<p>Faith grimaced as she curled up into a tight ball in the alley and
watched the emptiness of the city. San Francisco was a crowded city
but it seemed deserted at night.</p>

<p>Big city. Yeah, it was big. It was big and it was far away from
Sunnydale. Far away from her past...</p>

<p>Far away from Buffy.</p>

<p>Shaking her head vehemently, Faith pulled herself into a tighter
ball and willed those thoughts to leave her. That was the past... that
was her old life. She had to start things new.</p>

<p>She had to get away from all of that. Away from the slaying,
away from the death, away from herself. She had to do that to become
a new person. To become something different than what she was.</p>

<p>The darkness had almost taken her but she fought it and won.
She fought it for Buffy and that was why she won. Faith had helped to
prevent the Ascension.</p>

<p>In that moment in the dreamscape, her soul was redeemed as
Buffy forgave her. But that didn't really matter. Faith couldn't face
Buffy... her guilt wouldn't allow it.</p>

<p>So when she woke from the coma and the nurses asked if she
had any next of kin, she told them no. She told them no and then the
moment they left she escaped.</p>

<p>That was over two weeks ago.</p>

<p>And now, like before, she had nothing. No friends, no family,
and no Buffy. All she had were the stolen clothes on her back and a
knife that she'd taken off some lame ass who'd made the mistake of
thinking she was a helpless girl.</p>

<p>Shivering a bit, Faith adjusted her blue jeans that were three
sizes too big and rose to her feet. The alley just wouldn't do it for
tonight. She decided to head up to the mondo church they sometimes
let the homeless stay in. At least it was warm there.</p>

<p>She was still thin and weak but her slayer abilities had kicked
in and Faith almost felt up to speed. In fact, the only thing that was
keeping her from being at full capacity was her hunger. It'd been
almost two days since she'd last eaten anything.</p>

<p>"I'd kill for a fucking hamburger," muttered Faith as she pushed
her hands into the deep pockets of her jeans.</p>

<p>Still pondering the logistics of fast food and homicide, Faith
rounded a corner and froze at what she saw. Three women fighting
some weird looking men. Some weird looking men whose faces were
changing into all too familiar masks.</p>

<p>Narrowing her dark brown eyes, Faith snarled as she saw one
of the men's faces shift. "A vamp," she hissed. "You stupid fucks
followed me out here? Oh no you don't..."</p>

<p>With a loud scream of rage, Faith charged forward to tackle
the man that was holding one of the women up in the air and trying to
choke her. Wrestling the man to the ground she pulled the knife from
her back pocket and held it to his neck. He looked up at her with wide
startled eyes and seeing this she rewarded him with a vicious smile.</p>

<p>"So," Faith growled as she lowered her face to his and left only
mere inches between their skin. "It's not enough that you fuck up my
life there you wanna follow me out here too? Not smart, twinkie. Not
smart at all..."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" the man's voice was low and
gravely as his eyes burned red. He was about to say more when his
eyes widened and he said in wonderment, "I can feel your power. It
sings to me." His eyes narrowed and he demanded fiercely, "Who are
you?! Another witch?!"</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Faith with false cheerfulness. "That's the wrong
answer. Time's up and now you die!"</p>

<p>And with that, Faith plunged the knife into his heart only to
marvel when instead of turning to dust the dissipated in a shower of
bright light. She was still marveling over this when she sensed someone
nearing her. Whirling around, Faith looked into the wide eyes of a
petite brunette.</p>

<p>Not sensing any danger, Faith slowly rose to her feet and
shoved her knife back into her pocket as she scanned the area. The
other men were gone. But where? These women couldn't have killed
them all, could they?</p>

<p>"Uhm... hello?"</p>

<p>Faith mechanically turned her gaze to the smallest of the
women who wore an anxious but still pretty smile. Giving her a hard
stare Faith took a step forward, "What the fuck were those guys?
They weren't vampires were they?"</p>

<p>The petite brunette backed up and looked at the tallest one in
the group. The one with the piercing blue eyes, Faith noted. Blue eyes
frowned at Faith then said, "I think that before we answer that question
you should tell us just who you are."</p>

<p>Her lips quirking up in a small derogatory smile, Faith
considered the question. Who was she really? She had been so many
things over the span of the past year she wasn't even sure anymore.
But it wasn't like she could tell them that.</p>

<p>"I'm Faith," she said as she gave a slow and confident smile.
Much like her one of old. "A vampire slayer." Not waiting for a
reaction Faith said, "What about you?"</p>

<p>Blue eyes studied her and finally said, "I'm Prue. These are my
sisters Phoebe and Piper." She paused for a long moment before she
said, "And we were fighting warlocks."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" Faith raised an eyebrow. She looked back to
where the man had been and said, "They sure as hell have a lot in
common with vamps. Same facial features." Turning to the three sisters
she drawled, "So Miss Prue, Phoebe, and Piper. What were you
doing fighting these warlocks, huh?"</p>

<p>Prue's face contorted into another frown but suddenly the
petite one, Phoebe if Faith remembered correctly, pushed forward to
stand in front of her. She offered Faith a bright smile and said simply,
"We fought them because we're witches." On seeing Faith's eyes
widen at this, she added quickly, "Good witches!"</p>

<p>Immediately after Phoebe said this, her sisters eyes went wide
and they grabbed the back of her shirt to pull her away for what they
called a private conference. But from what Faith could tell it was more
a private chewing out.</p>

<p>Smiling without helping it, Faith murmured, "Witches. Well, life
suddenly got a hell of a lot more interesting."</p>

<center><font color=gold><b>One</b></font></center>

<p>"Ow, Prue," whined Phoebe as she yanked her arm away from
her older sister and rubbed it. "Try to kill me why don't you? What's
the big idea?"</p>

<p>At this comment, ice blue eyes narrowed by another notch and
Phoebe winced. "Jeez," said Phoebe slowly. "What bug crawled up
your butt? Didn't you hear her? She said she's a vampire slayer. She's
one of us, she fights the bad things."</p>

<p>"No," Prue pronounced in slow dangerous tones. She moved
forward to leave only a few inches between her and Phoebe's faces.
"She would be one of us if her last name was Halliwell. That's how
she'd be one of us, Phoebe."</p>

<p>"Also a good point," Phoebe said as she gave her usual smile
that was an impish apology of sorts.</p>

<p>Groaning lowly, Prue pulled away from the middle sister and
muttered something under her breath. As she did this, Piper looked at
Faith who was staring absently up at the night sky and seemed
unaware of their conversation.</p>

<p>"We don't know if that's really the truth," said Piper nervously.
"She could be lying to us you know."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Prue exclaimed as she whirled around to point at
Phoebe. When she saw their incredulous stares she mellowed a bit and
continued, "That's what I meant."</p>

<p>Phoebe rolled her eyes in exasperation and put her hands on
her hips. "I would've seen something if she was evil. Besides," she
added as she leaned in closer. "Where was the innocent we needed to
protect tonight? Nowhere. I think that she might be our innocent."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Prue skeptically. "She looks like an innocent to
me. You two saw how she fought. She's not the innocent that we're
supposed to protect, trust me on this."</p>

<p>"Prue," chastised Piper. She shot another look at Faith who
was now rocking back and forth on her heels while she gazed up at the
sky. "I don't know," she said slowly. "I think that Phoebe might be
right. Just look at how thin she is."</p>

<p>"So she's a model!" Prue threw her hands up in the air before
she muttered lowly, "Nobody ever listens."</p>

<p>Folding her arms over her chest, Phoebe looked to Piper and
said rather smugly, "She's getting that look again."</p>

<p>"Yup," said Piper as she nodded solemnly. "And you know
what happens when she gets that look."</p>

<p>There was a slight pause before Phoebe and Piper met their
eyes then said together, "She admits that she's wrong."</p>

<p>They saw Prue's shoulders twitch slightly before she slowly
turned around to meet their eyes. "I'm not wrong," she insisted quietly.
"You just refuse to believe that I'm right."</p>

<p>"She's wrong," Piper noted.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," Phoebe agreed. "Definitely wrong."</p>

<p>Ice blue eyes narrowed and Prue heaved a sigh before she
said lowly, "Fine. It's entirely possible that she could be the innocent
that we're supposed to protect but I--"</p>

<p>"She admitted it!" interrupted Phoebe brightly. She and Piper
exchanged a high five as she said, "We win!"</p>

<p>"I doubt that."</p>

<p>Faith's low and husky voice reverberated in the air and the
sisters slowly turned around to face her. The slayer wore a veiled
expression as she studied them carefully.</p>

<p>"How did you...?" asked Phoebe with wide eyes.</p>

<p>"I've got good ears," Faith replied. She shifted her gaze to
Prue and said, "You got me pegged quick. Nice."</p>

<p>The eldest Halliwell sister didn't reply and instead matched
Faith's steady gaze until the slayer moved her focus to Phoebe who
said, "I don't understand..."</p>

<p>"That's a good thing, sweets," said Faith as she looked into
Phoebe's wide eyes. "Trust me when I say that I'm not the innocent
you've got to protect. In fact," she paused to give an almost nasty
smile. "I'm anything but innocent."</p>

<p>"But you helped us," Piper jumped in. "And you're a vampire
slayer... whatever that is. We're like compatriots."</p>

<p>"Yeah!" chimed in Phoebe, who looked as if she had no idea
of what exactly she was supporting by saying this.</p>

<p>Faith's eyes darkened and she said, "I don't play that game. All
I need is me, myself, and I. Got it?" She sharply turned on her heel and
began to walk away. Faith paused to look back and lock eyes with
Prue. "You make sure that they don't follow me," she said in a low
warning. "I mean it."</p>

<p>"What?" Phoebe whispered after a minute. "Hey!" she shouted
to Faith's retreating form. "You can't do that! We've got to help you!
Don't you know that it's our sacred duty?!"</p>

<p>Phoebe started to move forward and after Faith when Prue
reached out to grab her by the arm. "No," Prue said in tones that were
surprisingly gentle. "Let her go."</p>

<p>"Are you kidding? She needs our help!" said Phoebe heatedly
as she glared at her older sister.</p>

<p>"Oh?" Prue arched an eyebrow. "With what? She's a good
fighter. She'll be able to protect herself just fine."</p>

<p>While Phoebe faltered with this logic, Piper looked to Prue
and said, "But she doesn't look well. You saw her. Why should we
just let her go like this?"</p>

<p>"We can't help her if she doesn't want us to," said Prue almost
sadly as she turned her eyes to where Faith had disappeared from the
street. "That's why."</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>It was hot.</p>

<p>It was damn hot.</p>

<p>Faith decided that she missed the cold. It was better to be
cold than hot. The cold she could deal with. She could find ways to
warm herself up. Very pleasant ways that would also land her a
comfortable bed for the evening. But the heat?</p>

<p>She didn't have a ready solution for that. Well, except for
finding a water fountain and sticking her head underneath it. But
somehow she felt that even the ultra liberal citizens of San Francisco
wouldn't approve of that sort of action.</p>

<p>So she just sat. In the heat. Griping internally.</p>

<p>San Francisco was a nice place to live. That much was for
sure. It was nice and she decided that she might as well stick around
for awhile. The eerie aura of cleanliness that it presented intrigued
Faith. There had to be a dark underbelly to the city. She knew it and
she wanted to find it.</p>

<p>No place could be this damn chipper. She knew that after her
encounter with the Sisters P a few days ago. They'd called themselves
witches and she wasn't sure that she could disprove them. Hell, she'd
seen weirder stuff than witches and knew that at some time Willow's
pet rat had been one.</p>

<p>Faith wondered if the Sisters P could turn into rats. She
snickered at the thought and searched her pockets for her crumpled
pack of cigarettes. Pulling one out, she lit it and watched the people
walk by.</p>

<p>Boring, boring, boring. What time was it? Faith craned her
head to look at the huge clock that emerged from the nearby bank.
Damn. It was only three o'clock.</p>

<p>That meant another two hours of waiting before Jessie arrived
to open up the club so she could go to work. She should've just
waited in the crappy hotel. At least it had a fan. She had left to avoid
getting cabin fever since she had nothing at all to do what with the
television being broken.</p>

<p>She hated it when that happened. When things got broken. But
that seemed to be a trend her life. Breaking things and having things
broken. Her family was broken, her love life was broken, and her job
as a slayer was broken.</p>

<p>It was all fucking broken.</p>

<p>But at least she had her cigarettes. Faith smirked at this
thought as she exhaled a smoke ring into the air. When she looked up
she met the eyes of a passing blonde and gave her a wide flirtatious
smile. The blonde immediately flushed before she returned the smile
and walked off with her friend. The pair paused in their walk and were
talking quietly as they shot what Faith assumed was supposed to be
subtle glances her way. Finally they burst into giggles and walked away
but not before they turned to give Faith blatant smiles.</p>

<p>Her smile growing wide, Faith murmured, "More customers
for the boss lady. I do my job all too well."</p>

<p>Jessie wasn't the bad sort. In fact, some might even call her the
good sort. Faith rather liked the woman who was in her late fifties and
scarier than any bull dyke she'd ever run into. And Faith had ran into
quite a few in her day.</p>

<p>When Faith had wandered into her club on the night after she
met the Sisters P, Jessie immediately latched onto her. At first Faith
thought that Jessie was putting the moves on her, something that she
normally wouldn't mind but only with someone close to her age.
Feeling this way, Faith got the older woman away from her the only
way she knew how.</p>

<p>She started a fight. Not just any fight. But a mammoth fight that
had already turned into a lesbian urban legend inside the club scene.
And when the fight ended Faith found herself with a job as the Pink
Lady's newest bouncer and bartender. All thanks to the fight and
Jessie's odd sense of humor that made her take a liking to Faith.</p>

<p>And that's how landed Faith her newest and possibly most
enjoyable job to date. Of course, using her patented fake ID also
helped somewhat.</p>

<p>A year may have passed but at nineteen Faith was still
underaged. She had a good feeling that Jessie knew that she wasn't
legal yet but her boss never pressed the issue so it was cool. Probably
because she trusted that Faith would never do anything to get her in
trouble with the authorities.</p>

<p>Trust.</p>

<p>It made Faith want to laugh and cry at the same time. Why did
everyone keep trusting her? Elizabeth had trusted her and she let her
be killed by Kakistos. Buffy had trusted her and she let their
relationship go to hell. The Mayor had trusted her and she let him die.</p>

<p>No, she helped him die. She'd killed him just as much as Buffy
had. Faith hated that.</p>

<p>She hated that she'd killed him. It didn't matter to her what
they said. He wasn't evil. Not really. The Mayor had too much depth
to be pegged like that.</p>

<p>Inside he was human.</p>

<p>A messed up human but still a human. And what the hell was
evil anyway? Who said what was good and what was bad? Faith had
seen so many horrible and twisted things go down in her short life that
she didn't know if there was such a thing as absolute goodness.</p>

<p>Everyone had a beast. Not just guys. Everyone. Each and
every person had a beast lurking inside of them waiting to get out. That
was just a fact of life. She knew that now.</p>

<p>Faith sighed at looked up at the clear blue sky. This was why
she hated being early for work. She always got to thinking heavy
thoughts. That was never a good thing.</p>

<p>She had just turned to look at the big bank clock to see that
somehow an hour had passed when she heard her name being called
out. Shifting her gaze she looked into the brown eyes of one of the
infamous Sisters P. She wasn't sure which one though. Their names
were just too... well.</p>

<p>P-culiar.</p>

<p>Damn, she just made up a lame ass pun. Faith now knew for
sure that she was getting really bored.</p>

<p>"Faith," the Sister P began. She saw the blank look the slayer
wore and said helpfully, "Phoebe? Three sisters and witches? Warlock
battle? You remember any of this?"</p>

<p>"I remember," Faith drawled. "How could I forget?"</p>

<p>"Right," said Phoebe as she gave a bright smile. She
considered Faith a moment then dropped down to sit with her on the
stoop in front of the Pink Lady. "So what're you doing here? Waiting
for vampire slaying information or something?"</p>

<p>"No," Faith chuckled. She put out her cigarette and said, "I
don't do much of that anymore. I'm just doing the boring and waiting
for my boss to get here."</p>

<p>"You work here?" Phoebe turned to look up at the sign for the
bar. "The Pink Lady," she read slowly. As she met Faith's eyes she
grinned and said, "Neat."</p>

<p>Smiling at this, Faith replied, "You could say that." She paused
to look forward and after a moment she said, "I hope that you've given
up on me being that innocent you need to protect. Because if there's
one thing that I can handle it's protecting myself. It's sorta been a
constant in my life."</p>

<p>"Okay," Phoebe drew the world out slowly. She was quiet for
awhile then she suddenly turned to look at Faith and said in quick
triumphant tones, "But you're still one of us!"</p>

<p>"What?" said Faith dryly. "I don't think so, sweets. I'm a
slayer. You're a witch. And what's with this us thing?"</p>

<p>"Me and my sisters," Phoebe said as she rolled her eyes. "And
you are so one of us. We protect the innocent with our powers. That's
why we're the Charmed Ones and you do the same thing. Except not
with powers but with the fighting and punching thing I guess. But it's
the same! See?"</p>

<p>"No," said Faith in deliberate tones. "I don't see and I don't
protect anything but me now. And listen to me when I say that's for the
best. I was never good at it anyway."</p>

<p>Phoebe considered this for a moment before she vehemently
shook her head. "I don't believe that," she said. "I saw you fight those
warlocks. You're good at what you do."</p>

<p>"Fighting," Faith muttered. "Yeah, I can fight good but that's
about it. I screw up at everything else."</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence and then Phoebe said
quietly, "You messed up. Didn't you?"</p>

<p>Faith's head jerked up in surprise and meeting brown eyes that
held clear understanding she replied, "Yeah. I did."</p>

<p>"Me too," said Phoebe with a sigh. "I've messed up more times
than I can count. On the inside I've always felt like I was a failure.
There was something that made me feel like I'd just never be able to
do anything right." She turned to look at Faith and said, "But I don't
feel like that anymore."</p>

<p>Almost against her will, Faith asked, "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because of my sisters," Phoebe murmured. "Because of our
powers and because of being a witch. It's our duty, my duty, to
protect the innocent. That made me stop feeling like a failure. It made
me feel important, feel special." She paused to look deep into Faith's
eyes. "It's like that for you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Faith said quietly. "It is."</p>

<p>"Then why deny it?" reasoned Phoebe. "Being a slayer is part
of who you are just like being a witch is part of me and my sisters."</p>

<p>Mulling over this, Faith stared at the bustling citizens as they
passed by and quietly said, "You still think I'm the innocent that you
need to protect. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Phoebe replied sheepishly after a moment.</p>

<p>Shaking her head, Faith looked at Phoebe and said, "I told
you before. I don't need protection."</p>

<p>"What about help?" asked Phoebe.</p>

<p>"What?" Faith blinked.</p>

<p>"You must need help with something," Phoebe barreled on.
"That's almost the same as protecting you. What do you need help
with? Love life? Job? Place to stay?"</p>

<p>Seeing Faith's droll expression change after she said the last
part Phoebe jumped on it. "That must be it!" she declared ecstatically.
"That's what you need! You need the protection of having a safe
environment! You need a place to stay!"</p>

<p>While Phoebe continued to babble on, Faith merely stared at
her with a dumbfound expression. Not even Willow or Buffy could
talk this much nonstop. And she was so happy to boot. She had to be
on something. Most likely Valium.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad I figured this out," Phoebe continued with a bright
smile. "Just let me talk to my sisters and we can get everything ready."</p>

<p>"Ready?" said Faith blankly. "Ready for what?"</p>

<p>"Ready for you to move in with us of course," said Phoebe as
she rolled her eyes. "What else would I be talking about? You just
now agreed to it yourself."</p>

<p>"I did?" Faith asked as her eyes went wide.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed Phoebe who bounded to her feet. "I've got
to be going. I'm supposed to help Piper out at her work, the Quake.
It's just down the street. You know it?"</p>

<p>"The Quake?" Faith echoed.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's it," said Phoebe brightly. "How about I pick you
up after work? When do you get off? At ten?"</p>

<p>"Midnight," Faith corrected slowly.</p>

<p>"Midnight it is!" Phoebe beamed widely before she turned to
walk down the crowded street. She paused to wave and called out,
"I'll see you then! I know that you'll make a great roommate!"</p>

<p>"Roommate," Faith repeated. She stared at Phoebe's
disappearing form and said faintly, "What just happened?"</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"You didn't," Piper said in slow disbelief.</p>

<p>"I did," replied Phoebe with a smug smile.</p>

<p>"Prue's going to kill you!" Piper exclaimed as she shook her
head. She walked towards the refrigerator and began searching
through it in preparation to cook dinner.</p>

<p>Phoebe shrugged at this and hopped up to sit on the counter.
"Maybe," said Phoebe who gave a lazy shrug. "But I don't much care.
I know that I'm right about her, Piper."</p>

<p>"You really think she's the innocent, huh?" Piper asked from
where she remained searching through the refrigerator.</p>

<p>"Yeah," replied Phoebe. "It may not seem like it to you but I
know it's true. I have this feeling about her."</p>

<p>"If you say so," said Piper skeptically as she closed the
refrigerator door as she held an assortment of food. "I just don't want
to be around when you tell Prue."</p>

<p>"Tell me what?"</p>

<p>Both sisters froze then slowly turned to look in the doorway of
the kitchen where Prue stood wearing a curious look on her face. She
blinked at their stares and said, "What have you done now, Phoebe?"</p>

<p>"What have I done?" responded Phoebe indignantly. "I'm
appalled! Why do you always assume it's me and--"</p>

<p>"Because I know you," interrupted Prue. "Now give."</p>

<p>Phoebe exchanged a solemn look with Piper then took a deep
breath before she told Prue what she had done now. And like the
many times before, her older sister was none too pleased with
Phoebe's actions.</p>

<p>Some things in life were horribly predictable.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Call me."</p>

<p>And with those parting words Faith had yet another telephone
number pressed into her palm. A smile played on her lips as she
watched the blonde bar patron walk away.</p>

<p>"Girl," Jessie drawled with her low southern accent. "You goin'
for a record or something?"</p>

<p>Chuckling at this, Faith flung her small white towel over her
shoulder and looked at her boss. It was just past eleven and the club
was starting to get into swing. People were flowing in the doors and
that meant Faith had more customers to flirt with. Something she loved
to do, mainly because flirting always guaranteed one thing.</p>

<p>More money to fill Faith's big jar of tips.</p>

<p>Plus it was fun to play the flirting game. It was something that
Faith enjoyed. There was something in the animalistic simplicity of it
that appealed to her. In a lot of ways it reminded her of slaying.</p>

<p>They were both hunts. One was a hunt for love, sex, or
sometimes even romance and the other for vampires. But they were
both hunts and Faith couldn't deny that she enjoyed them both a great
deal. Maybe even a little too much.</p>

<p>"If you're so interested in knowing the numbers I rake in we
could always keep score," said Faith as she quirked an eyebrow at
Jessie. "Just like at a football game, huh?"</p>

<p>At this comment, Jessie expelled a short barking laugh before
she gave a shake of her head. "You're crazy, but that ain't such a bad
idea," she commented. "That way we can try and keep track of your
heathen ways. Right girls?"</p>

<p>"Right!" the nearby customers at the bar chorused before they
gave into a round of laughter.</p>

<p>Although Faith was the newest worker and everyone knew
relatively nothing about her she was quickly becoming popular with the
customers because of her good looks and dry sense of humor. It also
helped her popularity that Faith had a habit of being affectionate with
her patrons.</p>

<p>"You buy the scoreboard and I'll get the numbers," said Faith.
She shot Jessie a final smile before she went to the customer flagging
her down at the end of the bar.</p>

<p>Jessie shook her head and chuckled before she turned back to
the bar full of customers to take another order.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"She works here?" asked Piper almost anxiously as she looked
up at the sign for the Pink Lady.</p>

<p>"I think she's a bartender," Phoebe supplied. She shot her
sisters exasperated looks and said, "Hello! This is the city of San
Francisco. Don't tell me you're surprised?"</p>

<p>"Frankly," said Prue drolly. "I'm more surprised that she's
working in a club. She looks underage."</p>

<p>"Well, obviously she isn't," said Phoebe. She then turned on
her heel and flounced into the club.</p>

<p>Watching Phoebe enter, Prue shook her head and walking into
the club she murmured under her breath, "Here we go again."</p>

<p>Standing outside of the club, Piper was still staring at the sign
to the Pink Lady before she finally noticed the fact that she was
standing all alone. Giving a high pitched squeak, Piper rushed into the
club and after her sisters.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Holy shit," Faith said lowly as she paused in cleaning the
empty glass. "She actually showed up."</p>

<p>"Who showed up?" asked Jessie curiously. She moved her
eyes across the club to follow Faith's gaze and discovered it rested on
three very beautiful women. "Them girls? Lemme guess, they're your
latest conquests, right?"</p>

<p>"No," said Faith with a wry grin. "It's not like that." Looking to
Jessie she put the glass down and asked, "Can I take off a few minutes
early? I gotta take care of this."</p>

<p>"Sure thing," Jessie replied easily. "You just have to promise to
tell me what this is all about tomorrow."</p>

<p>Her smile widening, Faith said, "I'll tell you as soon as I figure
it out the whole thing myself."</p>

<p>Watching Faith disappear into the crowd of club patrons,
Jessie shook her head and murmured, "That girl is just a mess of
trouble waiting to happen."</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"The Sisters P," Faith drawled as she came to a stop in front of
the three women. "You actually showed."</p>

<p>"Of course we did," said Phoebe with a smile. "I told you that
I'd be here and here I am."</p>

<p>"With us in tow," Prue reminded dryly.</p>

<p>"That too," Phoebe replied sheepishly.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh," said Faith with a chuckle. She looked to Piper who
seemed fixated on the crowd of dancing women. "I'm guessing this isn't
among your usual hangouts, huh?"</p>

<p>"If it doesn't have dead things or monsters then it isn't a usual
hangout," said Prue in sardonic tones.</p>

<p>Chuckling a bit, Faith said, "I can get that." Her gaze suddenly
turned solemn and taking a step closer to Prue she edged herself
between Prue and Phoebe so the other woman couldn't hear what she
was saying. "I know you don't believe I'm this innocent person you
gotta protect so why dontcha do me a favor and help me convince
your sister, huh?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to," murmured Prue whose ice blue eyes gained a
look of quiet respect. "But Phoebe doesn't tend to listen too well.
Especially not to me or anyone else who has an opinion that's different
from her own."</p>

<p>"Well, what about her?" Faith tilted her head towards Piper
who was still staring at the dancing women. "Can she help us out with
this or what?"</p>

<p>"Piper?" said Prue in disbelief. She shook her head and smiled.
"She's the mediator in the group. Piper doesn't ever take any sides.
That's just how she is."</p>

<p>"I know you're both talking about me," Phoebe's sing song
voice suddenly pierced into their conversation.</p>

<p>Faith and Prue turned to look at Phoebe who had her hands
on her hips and a smug look on her features. Faith looked at Prue and
said, "Looks like she caught us."</p>

<p>"Looks like," Prue replied wryly.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to back out of our deal?" Phoebe asked rather
huffily. "Because if you are--"</p>

<p>"Deal?" interrupted Faith. "What deal? You tricked me and I
didn't agree to anything. You can't deny that."</p>

<p>"Who said I was going to?" retorted Phoebe as her pretty
features formed a scowl. "And if I tricked you it was for your own
good. You need our help!"</p>

<p>"Here we go," murmured Prue under her breath.</p>

<p>"You be quiet," Phoebe said as she shot Prue a somewhat
dirty look. Turning back to Faith she said, "You need to be around
people who understand. We could help each other... it would be
good. Can't you see that?"</p>

<p>"No," said Faith quietly. "I can't. And I already told you that I
don't need your help. Why can't you just accept that and move on
already? You got others that need you so I'm just a waste of your
time. You got that?"</p>

<p>Scowling again, Phoebe folded her arms across her chest and
said loudly, "And I'm telling you that I'm not going anywhere until you
come with me! You got that?"</p>

<p>Only seconds after Phoebe declared this, Faith heard Jessie's
raucous laughter as she called out, "You better get going, Faith! That
girl sounds awfully pissed at you!"</p>

<p>And only seconds after Jessie said this, most of the club broke
out into laughter and Faith found about a hundred pairs of eyes
focused on her and the Sisters P.</p>

<p>"Aw jeez," Faith muttered under her breath. Shooting her boss
an exasperated look, which Jessie smirked at, Faith turned back to a
triumphant looking Phoebe. "All right," she said lowly. "I'll go." When
Phoebe brightened and started to say something, Faith added, "But I'm
not making any deals. This isn't forever, got it? I'm gonna move on."</p>

<p>Forming a slow smile, Phoebe replied, "We'll see."</p>

<p>Phoebe then turned on her heel and flounced out of the club
just like she had entered it. Watching this exit, Faith looked to Prue
and asked, "She always like this?"</p>

<p>"Always," replied Prue with a solemn nod.</p>

<p>"Great," Faith gave a low groan. "Just great."</p>

<p>With a shake her head, Faith followed after Phoebe to exit the
club. Prue smiled to herself and as she walked out of the club she
murmured, "Good luck to the latest victim."</p>

<p>Standing by the dance floor, Piper was still staring at the
dancing women before she finally noticed the fact that she was all
alone. Giving yet another high pitched squeak, Piper rushed out of the
club and after the others.</p>

<p>The club patrons who watched their departure, had a quiet
laugh to themselves and knew that this wouldn't be the last time they'd
see those three in here for Faith.</p>

<p>They just had a feeling about it.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p> "You live here?"</p>

<p>Faith looked at Phoebe before she climbed out of the
passenger seat to Prue's sports car and said, "Yeah. It's not the Ritz
but it's not like I'm Donald Trump, huh?"</p>

<p>"Real smart, Phoebe," said Prue before she followed Faith out
of the car and towards the broken down hotel that the other woman
was staying in.</p>

<p>"What'd I do?" Phoebe asked to herself more than Piper who
seemed to still be in a daze.</p>

<p>Forming a scowl, Phoebe exited the car to pursue Faith and
Prue who were already heading up the rusted stairs and towards
Faith's hotel room.</p>

<p>This left Piper alone once again. And after a moment, Piper
snapped out of her daze and looked around the empty car blinked
then said, "Where did everyone go?"</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Tell me something," said Faith as she shoved one of her three
shirts into the ratty backpack she'd found. "Why are you going along
with this? I know you don't wanna."</p>

<p>Studying Faith closely, Prue leaned against the wall and said
calmly, "Because I think that Phoebe's partially right. You're not an
innocent but you do need help. Besides," Prue paused to smile. "We
could use the rent money."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I can get that," said Faith with a chuckle. She shoved
one of her two pairs of pants into the backpack then wandered into
the bathroom. "You're straight up honest," her voice floated out. "I dig
that. I dig that a lot."</p>

<p>"Good," said Prue who had her arms folded across her chest.
"Because I have a question for you."</p>

<p>"Shoot witchy witch," Faith said. She wandered back into the
room with a handful of bathroom supplies.</p>

<p>"What are you running from?" asked Prue quietly. "Are you in
trouble with the law? Because if you are, we have enough problems
with the police thanks to our powers--"</p>

<p>Faith frowned at this and Prue paused on seeing it. She turned
to stuff her bathroom supplies into the backpack and said lowly, "I
don't have cops after me. Yeah, I messed up but it's nothing that I'll
have police after me for. There are others, but I doubt that they care
enough to do a chase."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" Prue found herself the question almost
against her will. There was something about Faith that intrigued her. A
sadness that couldn't be explained.</p>

<p>"Another story, another time," Faith murmured as she slung her
backpack over her shoulder. "If you don't want me living with you
now, that's totally cool. But you gotta be the one who ends up
explaining it to your sister. Because I dunno if I'd survive that
experience."</p>

<p>Laughing at this, Prue said wryly, "Forget it. There's no way
I'm facing Phoebe. You're definitely moving in."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Faith softly after a moment of pause.</p>

<p>"What are you thanking her for?"</p>

<p>The two turned around to see Phoebe draped in the doorway
to the hotel room and seeing her, Prue quirked an eyebrow then turned
back to Faith. Giving her another smile she said, "Good luck. I'll see
you in the car."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I'm gonna need it," Faith returned the smile.</p>

<p>Prue chuckled quietly before she exited the room past a
confused Phoebe who narrowed her gaze as she fixed it on Faith who
was nearing her.</p>

<p>"What was that about?" asked Phoebe suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sweets," drawled Faith. Taking soft hold of
Phoebe's arm she closed the door to the room and said, "You wanna
come with me to turn in my keys?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Phoebe who was in mystification about whatever
had gone on between her sister and Faith.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"And this is your room," said Piper with a smile. She turned on
the light and Faith looked in a somewhat musty room that was filled
with several boxes. "Sorry," Piper gave a sheepish smile. "We've been
using this room as our storage space. I guess that we'll just be moving
all of this stuff into the attic tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Cool," Faith wore a small smile as she set down her
backpack and looked at Piper. "Whatever you want, I'll do." She was
quiet for a moment before she shifted from foot to foot and looked at
Piper with lidded eyes. "Uhm," she began hesitantly. "I just wanna say
thanks. I know that you probably got something to do with this. You
and Phoebe, I mean."</p>

<p>"It was mostly Phoebe," replied Piper while she returned the
smile. Leaning on the door frame she folded her arms across her chest
and said, "But I have to admit that I do think that you just might need
our help. And maybe," Piper then formed a playful expression. "We
just might need yours."</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Faith quietly. "Maybe."</p>

<p>Pushing herself off the door frame, Piper wore a gentle
expression as she said, "You'll be safe here, Faith. With all the things
we've seen and what you've probably seen as a vampire slayer, there's
no reason to hide what we really are."</p>

<p>"Makes sense," admitted Faith who dragged her gaze away
from Piper's as she walked towards the bed. "But it just isn't all that
simple, is it?"</p>

<p>"No," Piper agreed softly. "Life never is." She studied Faith for
another moment before she gave another smile and said, "Well! I
should let you get to bed. It's almost two a.m."</p>

<p>Piper was almost out the door when Faith said, "Tell Phoebe I
said thanks and goodnight, huh?"</p>

<p>"I will," murmured Piper before she quietly shut the door to
Faith's room. She was leaning against the closed door in thought when
suddenly Phoebe appeared out of nowhere to stand in front of her.
Jumping slightly, Piper held her hand over her heart and exclaimed,
"Phoebe! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?"</p>

<p>"How is she doing?" asked Phoebe, ignoring Piper's questions
as she moved closer. "She's doing okay, right?"</p>

<p>"Faith's fine," assured Piper with a small smile. She touched
her sister's cheek forehead lightly and said, "But how about you? Are
you sick? You're acting strange."</p>

<p>"I'm not acting strange!" Phoebe said huffily as she pushed
Piper's hand off her forehead. "I'm fine! Fine, I tell you. Just fine!"</p>

<p>Watching Phoebe walk away as she continued her claims of
being fine, Piper looked to Prue who stood at the end of the hallway
wearing a droll expression.</p>

<p>"Methinks little sister has a crush," said Prue while moved
forward to stand next to Piper.</p>

<p>"Methinks you're right," said Piper with a smile. "And me also
thinks that crush just might be returned."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Prue arched an eyebrow. She looked at Phoebe who
was still busy ranting to herself and formed a slow smile. "This,"
drawled Prue humorously. "Should be fun to watch."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah," Piper said with a nod. "Lots of fun."</p>
