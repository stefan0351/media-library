<!-- It's Always Been You \ Part 30 -->

<p>Adding two sugars to her cup of coffee, Sam was thankful nobody was around to witness and interrogate her about the truly goofy smile which had been permanently attached to her face the past day or so.</p>
<p>Hearing the familiar footsteps enter the kitchen, Sam turned around, her smile widening even further as Brooke sat at the table, still clad in her Garfield pajamas.</p>
<p>Brooke smiled sleepily. "Where are they?"</p>
<p>"Mum's next door and Mike went to play golf again." Sam explained. "How anyone can find enjoyment in hitting a ball into a hole will always be a mystery to me." She smiled as Brooke silently held her arms out. Placing her cup down on the bench, Sam walked over and settled herself comfortably in Brooke's lap, placing a kiss on her forehead before she captured her lips with a short but sweet kiss.</p>
<p>Brooke sighed happily. "What time is it?" </p>
<p>"Almost one, lazy ass." Sam replied, as she ran her fingers through Brooke's messy, and slightly tangled hair.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, but you're my lazy ass."</p>
<p>"That's better" Brooke replied with a grin. "Besides, if somebody had kept their naughty hands to themselves, I wouldn't have spent half the night awake, all tense and frustrated!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Brook, I had no idea "Oh god, more" meant 'I'd like to sleep now" Sam replied with mock sympathy. "I'll keep that in mind next time."</p>
<p>"Don't you dare!" Brooke cried out as Sam laughed. "Are you trying to kill me?!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I got carried away" Sam apologized sheepishly. "When I'm around you, my hands don't seem to want to listen."</p>
<p>"Don't ever apologize Sam, I love it when you touch me" Brooke replied seriously "I don't ever want you to stop." She smiled shyly. "I can't wait to make love with you. It's just that I want to be fully functional for our first time, you know?"</p>
<p>Sam nodded. "I know, and you're right." </p>
<p>"The wait will be worth it, you'll see." </p>
<p>"If we don't explode first" Sam replied wryly, making Brooke laugh.</p>
<p>"I had a great time yesterday" Brooke commented with a smile. </p>
<p>"We should encourage the 'rents to play golf more often" Sam suggested. "Maybe we can get them a yearly membership at the country club?"</p>
<p>"Anything to get them out of the house is fine by me" Brooke replied.</p>
<p>"The movie marathon was fun."</p>
<p>"It was, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah" Sam smiled in agreement before she paused. "What did we watch again?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have a clue" Brooke replied with a laugh. </p>
<p>"I vaguely remember putting something in the dvd player" Sam replied, making Brooke laugh harder. "And you tease me about naughty hands!"</p>
<p>"I can't help it. My girlfriend is sexy and beautiful and I can't get enough of her" Brooke replied, smiling as Sam blushed. Her eyes roamed appreciativly over Sam's body, the jeans and red tank top casually accentuating her curves. "You look amazing, by the way."</p>
<p>Sam smiled, pleased. "I'm having lunch with Harrison remember?"</p>
<p>Brooke groaned. "Do you have to go?"</p>
<p>"Of course, silly" Sam replied, affectionately. "He said it was important."</p>
<p>"What am I going to do without you here?" Brooke answered with a slight pout.</p>
<p>"We've been together less than two days" Sam joked, secretly touched "and already you can't live without me." </p>
<p>"Why would I want to?" Brooke asked seriously. Sam stared at her for a moment, before kissing her deeply.</p>
<p>"I'll get back as soon as I can, okay?"</p>
<p>Kissing her once more, Sam walked away, leaving Brooke to watch after her thoughtfully. If the anxious feeling in her gut was any indication, lunch between Sam and Harrison was not going to end well. Brooke sighed and rubbed her face tiredly. </p>
<p>Harrison was in love with Sam after all.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>Brooke looked up in surprise as Jane entered the living room and sat down.</p>
<p>"Mind if I join you?" Jane asked unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Brooke shrugged, it's not as if she could stop her. "No, of course not."</p>
<p>Jane glanced at the television screen with a frown. "What are you watching?"</p>
<p>"MTV."</p>
<p>Jane watched, partly fascinated, as the tattooed young man rapped on about The Real Slim Shady, whatever that meant. She shook her head, not understanding the racket that passed for music these days. Jane focused her attention on Brooke.</p>
<p>"Where's Sam?"</p>
<p>"She's having lunch with Harrison" Brooke answered, groaning inwardly. She wanted to spend time with a McPherson, just not this one.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Brooke nodded. "She left about ten minutes ago."</p>
<p>"Is it just the two of them?"</p>
<p>"Yeah" Brooke replied curtly, smiling as Pink's 'Family Portrait' came on screen.</p>
<p>"That's wonderful!" Jane beamed happily.</p>
<p>"It is?" Brooke asked, glancing at her in surprise.</p>
<p>"It would explain the hickey on Sam's neck" Jane muttered absently.</p>
<p>"Hickey?" Brooke's eyes widened. She needed to be more careful. </p>
<p>"Are they dating now?" Jane asked, ignoring Brooke's question.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Sam and Harrison?"</p>
<p>"Well..."</p>
<p>"Don't tell Sam this" Jane interrupted, excited at the prospect, "but I've always thought Harrison would be perfect for her."</p>
<p>"You did? What about Alex?"</p>
<p>"Alex was a nice boy, very handsome, but not the one for her."</p>
<p>"And you think Harrison is?" Brooke asked, slightly annoyed.</p>
<p>"Of course! They have been friends since they were children" Jane replied, surprised as she noticed Brooke's irritated expression. "Don't you agree?"</p>
<p>Brooke faltered momentarily, not really expecting the question. "Uh, well, I don't think Harrison is Sam's type."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p><i>Well, one, he's the wrong gender and two, she's with me! </i></p>
<p>Knowing Jane wouldn't take that news particularly well, Brooke shrugged instead. Most people believed Sam and Harrison would end up together, if the amount of money placed with Sugar Daddy was any indication. Even she thought that, before Alex had come into the picture.</p>
<p>"If Alex is anything to go by, Sam's type would be tall blondes with hazel eyes" Jane continued absently, "which is quite the opposite of Harrison's dark looks." She turned towards Brooke, her expression thoughtful. "Did Sam ever tell you why she and Alex broke up? She won't tell me."</p>
<p>"Things weren't working out" Brooke answered simply.</p>
<p>"I see" Jane replied, half surprised that Sam had confided in Brooke. She paused, wondering why she wasn't more startled at this revelation. "So, Sam has told you everything?"</p>
<p>Brooke nodded awkwardly, thinking of the past couple of days.</p>
<p>Jane smiled. "It's nice to see you two getting along."</p>
<p><i>Lady, you have no idea.</i></p>
<p>"I'm sure you're relieved" Brooke answered sheepishly. "It makes for a quiet household, I guess."</p>
<p>"Exactly" Jane laughed. "I was pleasantly surprised when we came home yesterday, to find you two huddled on the couch asleep."</p>
<p>"We had a late night, uh...talking" Brooke lied, blushing as she recalled Sam's passionate greeting as she joined her in bed. "Besides, the movies we saw weren't very interesting." <i>Especially</i> <i>since we barely paid any attention to them. </i></p>
<p>"Golf wasn't interesting either" Jane commented wryly, interrupting Brooke's thoughts and making her laugh. "To be honest, I've been very concerned about you two lately" Jane continued seriously. "One minute, you're all smiles, the next you're at each others throats or not talking to each other at all. I waved it away as simple teenage hormones but I'm getting the feeling it's more than that."</p>
<p><i>If only you knew...</i></p>
<p>"I know we've been a little difficult to live with lately..." Brooke began awkwardly.</p>
<p>"You mean more than usual?" Jane joked.</p>
<p>"Well, yeah." Brooke smiled. "Sam and I have come to an...understanding."</p>
<p>"I've never really understood the animosity between you but I'm glad to hear things are changing" Jane replied with a smile. "Who knows? You might become the best of friends."</p>
<p>Brooke grinned. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"You had your tonsils removed in second grade, didn't you?" Jane asked abruptly.</p>
<p>Brooke was puzzled by the complete change of topic. "Uh, first grade, actually."</p>
<p>"Sam was in your class" Jane continued.</p>
<p>"Yeah, why?"</p>
<p>"When the teacher announced you were in hospital, Sam came home crying. She thought you were going to die." Jane confided with a small laugh. "I had to sit her down and explain that removing tonsils was not a life threatening operation. She calmed down after that."</p>
<p>Brooke stared at her in awe. "I never knew."</p>
<p>"You know Sam." Jane answered. "She's not one to show her emotions readily."</p>
<p>"I know, but we didn't really hang out back then, and when we did, it usually resulted in an argument." Brooke explained, completely warmed by the story. </p>
<p>Jane laughed. "Sometimes, that's how you know someone cares about you. You don't get angry or upset with someone unless they affect you in some way."</p>
<p>"I'm starting to realise that" Brooke admitted. </p>
<p>"Sam is a pretty level headed girl, not much manages to upset her. You are the only one who can truly get under her skin." Jane paused thoughtfully before she continued. "Sometimes I'm glad when I see you two fighting."</p>
<p>Brooke stared at her, surprised. "Why?"</p>
<p>"She almost shut down after her father's death" Jane explained sadly before she smiled softly. "I don't know what you did, but you helped bring her out of it. For whatever reason, you make her feel." She stood up and placed a gentle kiss on Brooke's forehead. "And for that, I'll always be grateful."</p>
<p>She walked into the kitchen without another word, leaving a stunned Brooke behind.</p>
