<!-- About a Girl \ Part 1 -->

<p><i><u>Manning Manor</u></i></p>

<p>"What's going on?" Grace asked wandering into the kitchen. Everyone was gathered around the counter not saying anything, simply starring at the table where Jessie alone seemed to be seated.</p>

<p>"Lily's trying to figure out if that was really cold medication she bought for Jessie yesterday," Eli whispered, his eyes never leaving his sisters back for a second.</p>

<p>"Jessie thinks eggs is a funny word," Zoë added from somewhere beneath Grace's right elbow. "She said so, but she's still eating them." Grace looked down at her little sister sighing internally to see that the child had that blasted placemat on her head again, only this time neither her mom or Rick seemed notoriously concerned about it.</p>

<p>"You don't think we should call someone do you?" Rick asked scrunching up his brow in concern.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Grace laughed looking at all of them like they were insane. "Can't she just be in a good mood?" she asked shaking her head before heading for the fridge. "Hey," she greeted looking at Jessie briefly before reaching for the orange juice container.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie responding shooting her a grin before turning back around and bringing her fork down to her plate, seemingly surprised to find it empty. Now intrigued, Grace watched as her stepsister shook her head and smiled with a `stupid me' expression, then got up, dumping her plate in the sink and headed out of the kitchen. But not before looking at everyone like they were pod people when they moved out of her way collectively. Grace smiled again and turned her attention back to the fridge. It wasn't the medication Lily had bought that was making Jessie act that way, she was sure of it. She doubted that Jessie was actually ever feeling sick to begin with, and if she had been, she'd certainly been fine when she'd gone up to the attic yesterday to deliver the medication, only to find Jessie and Katie standing around self-consciously but happily looking at her like they'd never seen her before. Then later, as she'd gone to leave the attic she'd looked back to find Jessie sprawled out on her bed looking up at the ceiling with a blissed out expression on her face, and she knew instinctively what must have happened between her and Katie.</p>

<p>"What did the warning label say?" Rick asked turning to look at Lily once Jessie had left the room.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Grace grumbled again rolling her eyes as she sat down at the table. She didn't know if she could take a whole day of this.</p>

<p><u><i>Hospital Parking Lot</i></u></p>

<p>Karen looked back at Eli sharing a brief smile with him as they watched Jessie bound off into the distance in search of the car. As Eli wheeled her out of the hospital, Jessie had run off saying she was going to prepare the car, because while Eli hadn't actually been raised in a barn, he lived like he had been.</p>

<p>"At least you didn't have to sit through her monologue on the beauty of butterflies," Eli grumbled good naturedly before tipping his mother's wheelchair back and running with it momentarily, stopping only when Karen begged him to stop. The action had earned him a slap on the arm, but also a smile, so he figured it all evened out in the end. "I swear it was like she'd never been outdoors before," he continued watching as Jessie's head disappeared behind a van a couple yards ahead of them. "And at breakfast, she actually let that little Hobbit cut her food into the shape of a bunny rabbit!"</p>

<p>"Hobbit?" Karen asked turning in her chair slightly. "Who's a Hobbit?"</p>

<p>"Zoë," Eli responded adjusting their course a bit as he spotted the car. "And before you get mad, Jessie's the one that called her that first."</p>

<p>"Why?" Karen asked bewildered.</p>

<p>"The kid used her favorite pair of socks to make a puppet," Eli responded grinning. "To this day ... well maybe not today," he amended, "She stomps out of the room whenever Mr. Buckley Buttonpants of Zoë's third drawer makes an appearance."</p>

<p>Karen smiled, soaking up this relaxing moment with her son, like it was the first day you could outside without a jacket after a long winter. Things had been so strained between them for the past little while, that it was nice to just be able to talk to him, and have him talk to her.</p>

<p>"She's in a good mood," Karen said softly a moment later, watching as Jessie threw some article of clothing out of the backseat and into the trunk.</p>

<p>"HEY! BE CAREFUL WITH THOSE!" Eli bellowed at the top of his lungs as Jessie began to fling some music sheets carelessly into the trunk. "Hey!" he yelled again, when she looked up at him then went back to what she had been doing.</p>

<p>"Eli, please," Karen said wincing as his voice reverberated in her ears.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said realizing what he had been doing. "It's just that we need those for practice tomorrow," he continued glaring at Jessie as he quickened his step.</p>

<p>"Did anything happen last night?" Karen asked sending him a reproachful look that caused him to slow down once again. He sighed; he was never going to be able to find the sheets he needed tomorrow.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked absently.</p>

<p>"Jessie, she seemed really upset the other day when she came by to see me," Karen responded. "But...she seems better now. Better than for a long while now," she continued softly.</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Eli said thinking back. "I don't know ... that hot chick she's been hanging out with came by...that's about it."</p>

<p>"Eli," Karen said stretching out her sons name with distaste. "Katie's 15," she continued looking back at him. Eli shrugged. "You're sure that's it?" Karen asked a moment later.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Eli responded. "After that she pretty much spent the whole night in her room listening to that CD she's got from prohibition times, or whatever," he continued making a face.</p>

<p>"Billie Holiday," Karen corrected gently. Prohibition times, Karen thought to herself, good grief.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's what I said," Eli responded finally bringing them to a stop beside the car.</p>

<p>"Said about what?" Jessie asked her head popping up to look at them from across the car.</p>

<p>"You're boyfriend Taaaaaaaad," Eli responded mockingly, making kiss-y faces before pretending to swoon.</p>

<p>"He's not my boyfriend," Jessie responded glaring at her brother, before ducking her head back into the car to toss the last of his crap into the trunk.</p>

<p>"'Oh Tad, I love you and you're gay porn sounding name'," Eli said in response, his voice rising in a crude attempt to mimic Jessie's voice. He was bitter about the treatment she had just given his `Sex Machine' t-shirt.</p>

<p>"Eli," Karen started, really not wanting to listen to two of them argue the whole way home, but before she could get anything else out, Jessie's head popped up again interrupting her.</p>

<p>"How would you know?" she asked, her eyebrow rising challengingly.</p>

<p>"Know what?" Eli asked not really liking the expression on her face. Jessie may have been younger than him, but when she wanted to she could rip anyone a new asshole. He clenched beginning to think that he should have listened to his mother.</p>

<p>"What his name sounds like," Jessie explained. "Been watching a lot of gay porn lately?" she asked grinning at him.</p>

<p>"Alright," Karen said holding up her hands, cutting Eli off before he could respond. "That's enough. Both of you behave." Both of them stared at her for a moment, looking like they wanted to object, then muttered that they would, and set about preparing the car for her. Karen smiled; it was good to be back.</p>

<p><u><i>School</i></u></p>

<p>"No, they sucked," Katie, stated emphatically. "No. No they sucked."</p>

<p>"You're just bitter because Acoustic Soul got shot down like a cougar at the Playboy mansion," Tad responded happily as Russell slapped him on the back.</p>

<p>"Just because you inherited your dad's taste from like the 70s it doesn't mean all of us have light candles at the Shrine of Bono," Katie responded shooting Tad a nasty sideways look. The truth was she was bitter that Acoustic Soul got shut out. "Besides, it was soooo long. I mean what time did it end, like 2 am? In corrupt prisons across the world they're torturing people with Jon Stewart's striptease."</p>

<p>"I thought that was funny man," Russell starting to laugh. "He was all...and then it was like..." he went on almost doubling over from the effort it was taking for him to hold in his girlish giggles.</p>

<p>Katie rolled her eyes, and turned away from the two guys letting her eyes scan the hallways. Catching sight of a familiar face, she broke out into a huge grin, which she then rather conspicuous covered.</p>

<p>"I'll catch up with you later," she called out already heading down the hall.</p>

<p>"Hey," Tad called out. "Are you coming tonight," he asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Katie called back almost out of earshot. Then she held up her hand making the `I'll call you' hand motion and disappeared down the next hallway.</p>

<p> "Alright, meet me outside of the gym after school and I'll give you a lift," Grace said with a long-suffering sigh as she checked her watch.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Jessie responded choosing to ignore Grace's tone. Sometimes with Grace it was best to do that.</p>

<p>"Looks like you've got a visitor," Grace commented a moment later, her previous sulky tone now gone.</p>

<p>"What?" Jessie asked looking up. "Oh," she continued seeing Katie propped up against a wall near her locker, seemingly reading a nearby poster. "Right. Okay, I'll see you later," Jessie responded trying to subtly shoo Grace away.</p>

<p>"Riiiight," Grace responded. "Later," and with that she continued on down the hallway smiling. Jessie was sooo busted.</p>

<p>"Hey," Jessie said coming up behind Katie. "What cha looking at?"</p>

<p>"Intramural floor hockey," Katie responded cocking her head towards the poster and sign up sheet.</p>

<p>"You thinking of joining?" Jessie asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"No. I like my teeth in my mouth," Katie responded, her hands brushing down over her skirt shakily before she finally turned to look at Jessie. "So, the world of academia is glad to have you back," she continued as they headed towards Jessie's locker.</p>

<p>"The feelings mutual," Jessie responded turning her lock slowly. She seemed to be having trouble remembering her combination. "Oh, and tell academia's mom thanks. The cookies she baked were breakfast this morning," Jessie continued knowingly.</p>

<p>"Busted, huh?" Katie asked, leaning against a nearby locker.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was a valiant effort," Jessie responded smiling. "It's good to see you," she continued, her voice dropping a little as she raised her eyes to meet Katie's.</p>

<p>"It's good to be seen," the girl responded, smiling softly, before turning her head to watch the passing students. "So ... you wanna do something later? I have extensive ideas about how to waste time. There may even be a flow chart but I can't remember if I got around to it," she continued glancing at Jessie. They had talked on the phone over the weekend, but hadn't actually seen each other since that afternoon in the attic. And as ecstatic as she was over what had happened in Jessie's bedroom that day, she wasn't sure where they stood exactly. She knew where she wanted to be standing, but it was up to Jessie.</p>

<p>"I told my mom I'd come straight home," Jessie replied closing her locker door. "There's still a lot of stuff to get back in order, I mean the mail pile alone was like a week's worth of work," she continued turning to face Katie.</p>

<p>"Yeah, of course," Katie responded. "Totally. I completely understand," she responded, her shoes suddenly seeming very interesting.</p>

<p>"You should come," Jessie said seeing Katie's expression and knowing what was probably going through her head. "She keeps asking about you anyway. Katie this and Katie that ... I swear it's like she wants to marry you or something," she continued smiling at the memory of her mother incessantly questioning her about Katie.</p>

<p>"Really?" Katie asked looking over at Jessie.</p>

<p>"Yeah, apparently I talk about you a lot," Jessie, responded shaking her head self-consciously. "You don't have to, I mean it's probably not going to be a lot of fun. She'll probably have us stocking cupboards or dusting something, but..."</p>

<p>"I'll come," Katie said interrupting her. "I mean, I'd like to go with you. We can do the whole underage illegal worker thing together."</p>

<p>"Cool," Jessie responded smiling, as she adopted a position similar to Katie's against the locker.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Katie agreed a wide grin spreading across her face. "So, you tired of lounging yet?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said pushing off of the lockers. "How do the jocks do it?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows," Katie responded heading down the hall. "But I suspect it has something to do with the numerous blows to the head. That just can't be healthy. Also, it's not very pretty."</p>

<p>"The real reason floor hockey is out?" Jessie asked gamely.</p>

<p>"I stand by my decision," Katie responded grasping Jessie's hand momentarily, letting go as they turned the corner. "My stop," she said glancing at the classroom door.</p>

<p>"Lunch?" Jessie asked.</p>

<p>"Well, that's right around the time I get hungry so you're in luck," Katie replied smiling. "I..." she started to say, looking at Jessie seriously. "Yeah," she continued shaking her head, "I'll see you then."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jessie said holding her eyes for a second longer. Then she continued down the hall, smiling once she was out of sight. Lunch never seemed so far away.</p>
