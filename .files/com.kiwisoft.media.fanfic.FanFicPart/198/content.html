<p>Willow was extremely nervous when she entered her parent’s house. She
had
finally gotten them to be in the same place at the same time, going so far

as to inviting herself over for dinner, and stressing the importance of
them
both being there. When she had finally told them that she had
something to
tell them, they had took her requests to meet seriously and Sheila
Rosenberg
had scheduled the night as parent/daughter night. Her mom was in the

kitchen cooking when she got there, the smells coming from the kitchen

making her feel guilty, as odors of pot roast filled the air. Her mom
must
have worked hard on dinner. Her dad had been reading the paper when
she had
walked in, and now he looked up from his reading to give her the famous

Rosenberg stare. Willow shifted nervously from foot to foot as she met
it.
Then felt ultimate relief as he stood, walked over to her and hugged
her.</p>
<p>“How’s my little girl?” Ira Rosenberg asked, shocking Willow
speechless.
He hadn’t called her his little girl since she had turned twelve.
Willow
met his brown eyes, seeing the love her father
held for her.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Daddy.” She said, stepping back from him slightly, sure
that he
would be able to tell she was pregnant just by hugging her. “How’s
work
been?” She questioned, hoping to get her
mind off of the reason she was really there.</p>
<p>“It never changes.” Ira Rosenberg said, going back to sit in his easy

chair. “So, I hear you wanted to tell us something.” He
started, watching
Willow start to squirm under his gaze. He
had thought she might be there to explain why she had chosen UC Sunnydale
as
a college instead of the finer places of instruction that had accepted
her.
The choice had undeniably disappointed
him. She could be sitting in the hallowed halls of Yale or Harvard,
instead
she had chosen to stick herself in a small town college. Ira had
never
really understood why. Sheila said it had something to do with
Willow’s
friend, Bunny. Sheila claimed that Bunny was a high school
delinquent.
While Ira didn’t really believe the girl was a true delinquent, he knew
what
juvenile delinquents looked like after all, he did concur that the reason

Willow had remained behind
probably did have something to do with Bunny.</p>
<p>“Do you care to share your news with me early?” Ira asked, risking a
glance
to the kitchen just to make sure Sheila was still occupied. She would

probably disapprove if she knew he was trying to
get the news out of Willow without her presence.</p>
<p>Willow followed her father’s look toward the kitchen door and shook her

head. “It might be better if we eat dinner first.” Willow
answered, both
as a way of putting the inevitable off for a
while, and to make sure she got to eat supper. Although the knots in
her
stomach might interfere with that feat. She and Buffy had decided
that it
might be better to tell Willow’s parents as little
as possible about how she really got pregnant. Actually, Buffy had
been the
one to make that suggestion. Willow had fought with her over that one
for a
while. Willow had argued that she didn’t want to have any secrets
between
her and her parents about the baby, and that it wasn’t fair to either Buffy

or to Oz to claim that Oz was the father of her baby.</p>
<p>Buffy had eventually won out, saying that Willow didn’t need the added

stress of what a whole revelation might bring. Not only would Willow
have
had to tell her parents that she was pregnant,
she would have had to tell them that she was a witch and that her lover was

another woman. Talk about a triple whammy. Willow had argued
that Buffy
would be telling her mother the whole truth. Buffy countered with
after
telling her mother that she was the Slayer and had been sleeping with a

vampire, anything else should be a piece of cake. Besides that, Buffy

didn’t have the added stress of being the one that was pregnant.
Willow had
finally given in and agreed to tell her parents that Oz was the
father.
They weren’t likely to find out the truth, considering that Oz was god
knows
where. Buffy had even gone so far as to suggest that Willow could
tell them
that the
pregnancy was the reason Oz had split in the first place, not being able to

handle it. They had gotten in a big fight over that one. Willow
refused to
speak to her until Buffy had got down on
her knees and apologized to her, in a very personal and convincing
way.</p>
<p>Buffy had wanted to come with her tonight, but it seemed tonight was the

only night Mrs. Summers had off from the Gallery and Buffy had gone over to

tell her mother what was going on. Willow wondered how Buffy was doing with

her mother, as she and her family prepared to eat.</p>
<p align=center>**************</p>

<p>
“Can I help you with those, Mom?” Buffy asked, noticing Joyce coming
into
the kitchen struggling with a couple of very heavy grocery bags.</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you, Buffy.” Joyce Summers said, sighing with
relief as her
daughter took the bags from her.</p>
<p>“No sweat.” Buffy said, not even breaking into one as she carried the
bags
over to the kitchen counter. She started taking the items out as she
looked
her mother over to see if she could tell what kind of a mood she was
in.
The blonde watched as Joyce poured herself a glass of cold water, then sat

down on a stool beside the counter to drink it. Buffy emptied the

groceries, putting them where they belonged while waiting for her mother to

relax a little bit.</p>
<p>After Joyce had rested for a few minutes, she stood up to prepare
supper.
After placing a couple of potatoes in the oven to bake, she took out the

steaks she had bought for supper and started frying them. Buffy
wordlessly
started cutting up some onions to fry for the steaks, the pair of them

preparing supper in silence.</p>
<p>Buffy kept throwing her mother glances which Joyce finally noticed, and

looked at her daughter curiously. “Buffy...is there something you
want to
tell me?” Joyce asked, her curiosity growing when startled blue eyes
swept
up to meet her own.</p>
<p>“Umm...” Buffy gulped, then nodded her head, her eyes shifting around
the
room as if she couldn’t bear to meet her mother’s eyes. Joyce turned
the
heat down on the steaks, then took her daughter’s hand and led her into the

living room.</p>
<p>“Come on. Whatever it is can’t be as shocking as learning you are the

Slayer.” Joyce said, sitting down beside Buffy and turning so she
could
make eye contact with her. “Whatever it is, I promise I won’t react
the way
I did last time. I think I’ve learned my lesson from that
mistake. I just
wan’t to be there for you, Buffy.”</p>
<p>Buffy took a deep breath for courage, then looked her mother directly in
the
eyes. “Willow’s pregnant and I’m responsible.” Buffy said,
seriously.</p>
<p align=center>************</p>
<p>“You’re what?” Sheila Rosenberg asked, her eyes wide-open in shock,
at what
her daughter had calmly just revealed to her. Ira just sat there
mutely,
too much in shock to say anything. This certainly had nothing to do
with
his daughter’s choice in colleges.</p>
<p>“I’m pregnant.” Willow calmly repeated, waiting with bated breath to
see
what her mother would do.</p>
<p>Sheila sat there for a minute, willing the news to settle into her
head.
“It...It’s that musician’s isn’t it. The boy with the name from that
book.”</p>
<p>Buffy had said that they would jump to that conclusion, and she had been

right. But it wasn’t as if Willow had been with that many other
boys. It
was easy for them to come to that conclusion. “Oz.” Willow murmured,

remembering the stoic person that had been her first boyfriend.</p>
<p>“Does he know?” Sheila asked, wondering just how much damage control
she
could throw on the whole situation. She knew of a couple, the
Fleishman’s
who were looking to adopt a child. They were a good Jewish couple who
she
knew would raise her grandchild in the Jewish faith that Ira found so

important.</p>
<p>Willow shook her head watching something playing across her mother’s face,

although for the life of her she couldn’t figure out what it was.</p>
<p align=center>************</p>
<p>If Joyce thought Buffy could never bowl her over again, she had just been

proven wrong. She felt the same sense of overwhelming shock she had
felt
the night Buffy had told her she was the Slayer. She shook her head,
her
eyes filling with disbelief, her mind wondering if her ears had heard

correctly. “Wh...what?”</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and repeated what she had said. She and her mother had a

staring match, before Joyce broke the contact, shaking her head to clear
it.
 “How?” Her mother asked, demanding an explanation. Buffy
gave her the
condensed version of what had happened, leaving out most of the details,
but
giving her a general idea of how it had happened.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do, Buffy?” Joyce asked, knowing her daughter
had
some plan cooked up in her head.</p>
<p>“Well, I figured I’d quit college and get a job somewhere...” Buffy
started
to say, before she was interrupted.</p>
<p>“No.” Joyce said, emphatically.</p>
<p>“What?” Buffy asked, not knowing what her mother had objected
to.</p>
<p>“You are not, under any circumstances, quitting college.” Joyce said,

determinedly.</p>
<p>“But, Mom...I have to be able to support Willow and the baby!” Buffy

exclaimed, wondering how her mother could deny her the right to take care
of
her new and rapidly growing family.</p>
<p>Joyce tried to stay calm as she saw the open objection on her daughter’s

face. “You’ll be much better able to take care of them after you get
a
degree.” Joyce stressed, noticing Buffy’s eyes
didn’t look much calmer.</p>
<p>“And what am I supposed to do until then? Huh? How am I
supposed to take
care of them if I’m not working? We have to get a place to live...I
have to
get a car...I have to be able to get insurance...” Buffy started ranting,

already having jumped off of the couch and starting to pace the length of

her mother’s living room.</p>
<p>“Buffy...calm down.” Joyce said, standing up and placing her hands on
her
daughter’s shoulders. “I realize it’s going to be hard on you for a
while.
Which is why I’d like you to move back in here with me.”</p>
<p>“What?! You wan’t me to move back in here and forget about Willow and
our
situation? And just where is Willow supposed to go?” Buffy
asked,
completely missing her mother’s point.</p>
<p>Joyce shook her head. Usually Buffy was a little quicker on the
uptake.
Her daughter must have been really worried not to see what was right in

front of her. “You misunderstood me Buffy. I
would like it very much if both you and Willow moved in here with me.
At
least until you both finish your college educations and can get better

paying jobs. There is plenty of room here for both of you, and
besides it
would save on room and board.” Joyce said, watching Buffy’s eyes go
from
dark and stormy to bright and shiny within moments.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Mom. You’re the best.” Buffy said, hugging her mother

enthusiastically. “I’ll have to talk to Willow about it, but if she
agrees,
we would love to move in.” Buffy was greatly relieved.
The jobs she had looked into wouldn’t take her without a college education,

and anything that she could get without a degree wouldn’t have paid enough

to keep them clothed and fed, not to mention having a roof over their
heads.
 Buffy would still look for a part time job, saving up extra money
for when
the baby came wouldn’t hurt, but now the pressure was off of her chest and

she felt like she could breathe again. Buffy wondered if Willow’s

conversation with her parents was
going half as good.</p>
<p align=center>************</p>
<p>“You want me to give my baby up for adoption?!” Willow cried,
outraged, as
she stood up from the table and looked at her parents wildly.</p>
<p>“Willow, you are not ready for the responsibility of taking care of a

child.” Sheila Rosenberg tried to reason with her daughter.
“You have just
started college. You have no way to support a child. Besides,
do you
really think you are ready to be a mother? You’re just a child
yourself.”</p>
<p>Willow felt like she was about to hyperventilate as she stood staring at
her
mother. She glanced at her father, but his expression didn’t give her
any
hope that he was on her side. Willow shook her
head in disbelief. “I can’t believe this. I can’t believe that
my own
parents are against me in this.”</p>
<p>“Willow, we are not against you. We love you. You are our
daughter. Which
means we want the best for you.” Ira Rosenberg said, at last.
He had been
silent throughout the whole conversation, up until now. “We just
don’t
think that raising a child right now would be in your best interests. And
it
wouldn’t be in the child’s best interest. It deserves to have two
parents
that can take care of
it. You aren’t through college yet and this boy you were with isn’t
even
around...and quite frankly I find that very suspicious.”</p>
<p>Willow didn’t know what to say to that. She couldn’t exactly tell
them the
truth, that she and Buffy were together and they were planning on raising

the child together. But no way was she
going to give up their child. Buffy would be devastated. And
Willow would
feel like she was ripping her own heart out of her chest. Her eyes
filled
with tears at just the thought of it. “I’m not
giving up my baby.” Willow said, so quietly her parents barely heard
her,
but they could see the determination in her eyes and knew that she wouldn’t

listen to anything that they had to say on the subject any more.</p>
<p>“Well...maybe one day you’ll be willing to listen to reason.” Sheila

Rosenberg said, finally, her eyes boring holes into her daughter. Her

father stayed silent, as if he was in full agreement with
what her mother had said.</p>
<p>Willow looked at her shoes for a long uncomfortable moment, then looked
back
at them, the tears she had held in her eyes finally dripping down her

cheeks. “I think I should go before I say
something I can’t take back.”</p>
<p>“Willow...” Her parents said at the same time, trying to keep their
daughter
in the room.</p>
<p>“No.” She said, shaking her head. “I’m sorry...but I’ve gotta
go.” Then
she turned and left.</p>
<p>Sheila and Ira Rosenberg were left staring at each other, wondering what in

the world they were going to do to help their daughter.<BR></p>
<p>Buffy was laying on her bed looking through a prenatal mother’s magazine
Dr.
Wiseberg had given to Willow, when the redhead in question came through the

dorm room door looking like somebody had kicked her puppy.</p>
<p>“I take it that the news went over like leftovers.” Buffy observed,
as
Willow came across the room and crashed landed on top of her, letting out a

little whimper in the process.</p>
<p>Buffy brought her arms up to circle her lover, holding her tightly and

letting her relieve some of the stress she had gone through that
evening.
“You wanna talk about it?” Buffy asked, rubbing Willow’s back in
circles.</p>
<p>“Mmm...My parents want me to give the baby up for adoption.” Willow

muttered into Buffy’s chest.</p>
<p>At first, Buffy couldn’t make out what Willow had said, then the words

dawned on her senses causing her to stiffen. “What?” she asked,
hoping she
had heard Willow wrong.</p>
<p>“They said that I’m too young to raise a child and that I should give up
the
baby. They even mentioned that they have some friends that had been
looking
to adopt one. And wouldn’t it be just dandy if I gave them my
baby. How
could they?” Willow asked, outraged, as she looked into her lover’s
face,
seeing her ire matched by the look in Buffy’s blue eyes.</p>
<p>Buffy tried really hard not to be upset, but Willow could tell from the

tension in Buffy’s body and the look in her eyes that she was upset.
“I
can’t believe they said that to you, Will.” Buffy said,
finally, her anger coloring her voice.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.” Willow said, quietly.</p>
<p>“It does matter, Will!” Buffy objected, strongly. “They are
your parents.
They’re supposed to support you. Not hurt you, by trying to take your
baby
away. I don’t get it.” Buffy said, angrily.</p>
<p>“No, I mean it. It doesn’t matter.” Willow said, taking on a
more positive
tone in her voice. “Because, they can’t take her away from us. I
don’t care
if they support me or not. I have you, and that’s all that
matters.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Will.” Buffy sighed, staring into her lover’s green eyes.
Buffy
didn’t know how Willow did it. How Willow managed to find the
silver
lining over and over again, but she was glad that she did because Buffy

would have sank into the murky depths a long time ago without
her.</p>
<p>“How did your talk with your mom go?” Willow finally asked, breaking
their
reflective silence.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled awkwardly. “A little better than yours. She
refuses to let me
quit college.” Buffy said, bemused.</p>
<p>“Well, I agree with her there.” Willow said, surprising
Buffy.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?” Buffy asked, a light eyebrow arching as
she
looked at Willow questioningly.</p>
<p>“Well, I never thought you should quit college in the first place.”
Willow
argued, looking at Buffy, resolve face in place.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you ever say anything?” Buffy asked, feeling if everybody
knew
what was going on around her except her.</p>
<p>“Would you have listened to me if I had? You were so gungho about
quitting
college and getting a job. And I know what a hard head you have
so...”
Willow said, smiling a bit at the last sentence.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Buffy objected, even though she knew it was true. She had been
so
caught up with the responsibilities of being a parent that she hadn’t even

considered any alternatives, and doubted she
would have if her mother hadn’t given her another plan that worked
better.
“That hurt! Even though you’re right.” Buffy said, shrugging a
little.
“Anyways, she said that we could move in
with her, if there aren’t any objections.”</p>
<p>“She did?” Willow said, a little bit shocked. She thought Mrs.
Summer’s
would have basically the same reaction her own parents had. She
thought
that maybe Joyce would have even blamed her for it. She didn’t expect
Joyce
to ask the two of them to move in with her.</p>
<p>“Uh huh. She said that it would save her money on paying for the dorm
room,
and it would help us to save money for when the baby comes, besides letting

us finish college to get better jobs.
Also...I think she’s been a little bit lonely since I moved out. It
will
give her someone to talk to, and she’s always liked you, Will. What
do you
think?” Buffy asked, unsure of what Willow’s
reaction would be. Whatever it was, she knew she would stand behind
her,
but she kind of thought this solution would be the best one for
them.</p>
<p>“When do we move in?” was all Willow asked, as she smiled brightly
down
into Buffy’s face.</p>
<p>Buffy beamed back at her, hugging her tightly, as she finally felt some of

the worries she had felt for days untightening themselves from the hold
they
had had on her gut. “As soon as you’re
ready.” Buffy answered in a whisper, kissing Willow lightly on the

forehead, and thought about the changes that would soon be happening in her

life.</p>
<p>In a way, it was kind of a step backward, moving back into the warmth and

safety of her Mother’s house. But mostly, it was a step forward, a

preparation for things to come as she and Willow prepared for their future

together, and the future of their baby.</p>
