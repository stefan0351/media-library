<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Fourteen -->

<p>Brooke sat drinking her tea the next morning still fuming mad that Nicole had pulled such a dirty trick. </p>
<p>&lt;This was supposed to be Sammy?s special trip. Something to remember her father by and something special for her and I to share. Damn Nicole for horning in where she wasn?t wanted&gt;</p>
<p>"Morning, Brooke," Sam said as she entered the kitchen. Brooke?s bad mood immediately lifted upon seeing Sam. "Where is everyone?" she asked grabbing some scrambled eggs that were sitting on a nearby plate.</p>
<p>"Well, aside from you and?Nicole," she fairly growled the name. "Everyone else went into town to see the sights and ski," Brooke explained. Sam nodded and poured herself some orange juice.</p>
<p>"What about you?" Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see what you were doing," she said.</p>
<p>"Ooo, planning your day around me?" Sam teased. Brooke smiled glad to see that their pattern of teasing wasn?t going to change just because they had company.</p>
<p>&lt;Besides, it?ll really piss Nicole off&gt;</p>
<p>"You know me, Sam. Where you go, I follow," she retorted. Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"You just like to watch my ass," Sam upped the ante. Brooke wasn?t intimidated.</p>
<p>"And what an ass it is," she shot back enjoying the way Sam suddenly blushed. "What? You think I never looked? Please."</p>
<p>"You tease," Sam chided.</p>
<p>"You started it," Brooke pointed out still smiling. "So, what are your plans for the day?"</p>
<p>"She is spending the day with me," Nicole informed her haughtily, angry after overhearing the entire exchange beforehand.</p>
<p>&lt;How DARE Brooke talk to Sam like that? I?ll show her who belongs to who&gt; Nicole stewed. Brooke glared at the newcomer to the kitchen as Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"Nicole?" she stared wanting to stop any trouble between the two blondes. Brooke stood up quickly.</p>
<p>"That?s fine, Sam. I think I?ll just hang around here and enjoy the quiet. Have a good day," she stormed off also not wanting to give Nicole the satisfaction. Sam turned and scowled at Nicole.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to push her buttons like that?" she asked angrily. Nicole stared at her blankly.</p>
<p>"Like what? And why do you talk to her the way I just heard you?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Sam asked confused.</p>
<p>"You were flirting, I heard you!" Nicole accused. Sam rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh I was not. Get over it. You know, I am so not liking this paranoid possessive thing you have going," she said walking towards her room to get changed. "Either chill out or go home because you?re ruining my vacation."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke could hear Sam and Nicole shouting later the next evening as the two girls returned from town. Everyone else was upstairs playing cards as the last two cabin-mates arrived home. Brooke sat in an armchair out of sight as Sam and Nicole entered the house.</p>
<p>"Let it go, damn it Nicole!" Sam nearly screamed. "You do not own me."</p>
<p>"I am your girlfriend and as such I deserve some expectations," Nicole pointed out. Sam whirled around on her.</p>
<p>"What you deserve is a swift kick in the ass for your behavior today!" she yelled. "You have done nothing but bad mouth Brooke and my behavior. How many times do I have to tell you that nothing happened?"</p>
<p>"Until I believe you," Nicole shot back.</p>
<p>"I shouldn?t have to explain ANYTHING to you. You should trust me!" Sam countered.</p>
<p>"Yeah right. Around Miss Perfect? Please Sam, I don?t trust either of you," Nicole growled.</p>
<p>"That?s not fair. So what if I find her attractive?"</p>
<p>"YOU FIND HER ATTRACTIVE?" Nicole screamed. Sam winced, as did Brooke in the next room.</p>
<p>&lt;Bad move, Sam&gt; Brooke thought. &lt;That?ll piss her off more&gt; But at the same time, it made Brooke happy to hear.</p>
<p>"Oh for God?s sake?" Sam sighed. "Yes, I think Brooke is beautiful. So? She?s straight, Nic. Try to remember that little fact. I could throw myself at her feet and she?d pat me on the head and say ?Sorry Sammy. You?re barking up the wrong tree?. So you have nothing to worry about."</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Sammy, if you only understood&gt; Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"I want you to stop spending so much time with her. She?s twisting you away from me?"</p>
<p>"No, Nic, you?re doing that fine on your own," Sam sneered. "And who the Hell are you to tell me who I can and can?t spend time with?"</p>
<p>"Your girlfriend," Nic declared. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, we agreed when we started out that this was for ?fun?. Nothing more. No pesky emotions to get in the way and make it more than that. We were just enjoying each other, Nicole. Don?t stand there and decide that because you?ve slept with me that you can run my life," Sam snarled.</p>
<p>"You WILL listen to me, Sam?" Nicole started, used to getting her own way if she was intimidating enough.</p>
<p>"NO! No I won?t! You don?t own me, Nicole. Your name is not tattooed on my ass. No where on me does it say ?Property of Nicole Julian.? I am free to do as I chose, thank you. You are not my mother, or my spouse! You do not rule me." </p>
<p>"No but Brookie does," Nic said condescendingly. "She snaps her fingers and you come running."</p>
<p>"Will you get off of that trip? Brooke does not have feelings for me."</p>
<p>"God, Sam, open your eyes!" Nicole ordered. "She is so into you!"</p>
<p>"Get a grip," Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"No, Sam, YOU get a grip."</p>
<p>"You know what? Brooke was right about everything she ever said about you. You are a self-centered little harpy who only cares about getting what she wants and what is best for her. I am SO glad Brooke is nothing like you."</p>
<p>"Oh, so you KNOW she?s ?nothing like me?, huh? And how would you know that?" Nicole asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"We?ve grown closer recently," Sam said not backing down from the unspoken challenge. "You have a problem with that? So we flirt, so what? I find her attractive. And you know what else? She thinks I?m attractive too. What do you think of that? Bet you REALLY feel threatened now you insecure little head case," Sam taunted. Nicole felt her face flush with anger.</p>
<p>"She TOLD you that? Unbelievable!" Nicole growled.</p>
<p>"What? It?s unbelievable that someone like Brooke could find me attractive? Gee, thanks Nicole," Sam said sarcastically. Nicole shook her head.</p>
<p>"Sam?" Nicole began. "Damn it I knew Brooke was going to do this."</p>
<p>"Do what?" Sam asked confused but Nicole?s sudden shift from anger to something else, almost hurt.</p>
<p>"I just knew she wouldn?t be able to keep her hands to herself and the SECOND you were offered that you?d jump at it." Sam arched an eyebrow and stared at the short-haired blonde.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" she asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Brooke. And you know damn well what I mean, Sam. She?s about as straight as k.d. lang at a Melissa Etheridge concert," she sighed. </p>
<p>"What?" Sam asked disbelieving. Nicole started pacing, totally ignoring Sam?s presence for the time being.</p>
<p>"I thought if I got here in time I could keep her from getting to you. I mean, I knew how she felt but I never thought that that little meek minded, whishy washy push over would have the balls to act on it," she ranted to herself. Sam?s jaw just about hit the floor.</p>
<p>"Are you saying what I think you?re saying?" she asked barely above a whisper. In the next room, Brooke held her breath. Everything came down to the next few minutes and she knew it. She was terrified.</p>
<p>"Brooke?s gay, Sam! And desperately in love with you, you stupid twit!" Nicole threw her hands up in the air as she yelled. "How could you have been so blind?"</p>
<p>"Liar," Sam hissed.</p>
<p>"No, Sam, it?s the sad, God?s honest truth," Nic said defeated. Sam?s eyes narrowed and turned cold.</p>
<p>"And you knew for how long?" Nicole felt her blood run cold as she realized that she just lost Sam due to her own big mouth.</p>
<p>"Before you even came out," Nicole confessed in a whisper knowing that there was no winning now so she might as well be honest. Maybe that way she could at least still do a little wounding to both girls.</p>
<p>"That long and you didn?t tell me?" Sam asked advancing on Nicole dangerously. "You knew all that time and didn?t tell me? And what was all this, huh? What was us? A con? No, I know what it was. A way to hurt Brooke, a way to REALLY put the screws to her. You BITCH!"</p>
<p>"Sam, let me explain?" Nicole tried to interrupt.</p>
<p>"No! If that?s the way you?re going to be, Nicole, you can just go back to LA and consider us through!" Sam stormed out the front door, slamming it behind her.</p>
<p>"Damn it," Nicole swore as she watched Sam leave. She heard someone clapping behind her and turned to face Brooke leaning in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Nic, you blew it," she laughed. Nicole glared at her.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, Princess. Are you happy? You win." Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"It never had to be a contest, Nicole. You?re the one who had to play the game. You betrayed me and my confidence. I don?t know what your smarmy plan is, but it?s not going to work. Especially now that you?ve lost Sam. You?ve no one to blame for this mess but yourself so, well that?s sad. You had everything, and you blew it."</p>
<p>"Screw you," Nicole spat and headed to go pack her things. She wanted to get as far away from the cabin and everyone in it as soon as possible.</p>
