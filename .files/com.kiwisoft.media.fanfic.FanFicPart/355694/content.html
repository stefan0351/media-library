<!-- Kara's Moon \ Chapter Thirty -->

<p>"It's the Big Tree," Nana said excitedly. </p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"It's . . . beautiful," she said, looking closer. "Look, there are people ..."</p>
		<p>"Yes," Ginny said sharply. </p>
		<p>Nana looked up. "Should we hang it above the sofa?" </p>
		<p>"No. I want to put it in my room," she said.</p>
		<p>"In your room? Why, it would look wonderful out here," Nana said.</p>
		<p>Ginny stared at her. "I would rather hang it in my room."</p>
		<p>"Well, okay. It is your painting," Nana said defensively. "Did you see
			her?"</p>
		<p>"No. I bought it at a gallery, downtown," she said.</p>
		<p>"What did you pay?"</p>
		<p>"It doesn't matter," Ginny said quietly.</p>
		<p>"Too much, no doubt. You should have just asked her for one. She said she
			sometimes gave them as gifts," Nana said.</p>
		<p>"Like I said, I didn't see her," Ginny said. She left, taking the painting
			with her. She propped it against the bed and stared at it, again. It was all
			there. Everything she felt, it was there. Kara had captured it exactly. Their
			love. </p>
		<p>She squeezed her eyes closed, trying to ward off the tears that she knew
			would come. She had been unable to stop them last night and today. She had
			cried. She had cried for herself. She cried for Kara. She cried because the pain
			in her heart was nearly too much for her to bear. </p>
		<p>Maybe she shouldn't have taken the painting. It was too painful to look at,
			really. Maybe she should just put it away for awhile. Maybe later, years from
			now, she could look at it and not remember.</p>
		<p>"Where are you?" she whispered. "Why won't you come back to me? I know you
			love me." She tucked her face into her hands and cried, deep sobs that came from
			her heart.</p>
		<p>She cried when the espresso machine gave her mocha instead of a latte. She
			pounded the side, tears streaming down her face.</p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"Damn thing," she muttered. She sipped the mocha and it burned her mouth.
		</p>
		<p>She cried when she restocked the shelf with cereal, knocking several boxes to
			the floor. She picked them up, wiping at her tears.</p>
		<p>"Ginny? What's wrong?" Nana asked. </p>
		<p>"Nothing."</p>
		<p>She cried when she burned the garlic bread they were having for dinner.
			"Goddamn it!" she yelled, jerking the bread from the oven. </p>
		<p>"Ginny?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," she whispered.</p>
		<p>Nana stared at her, not knowing what to say. </p>
		<p>And she cried in bed, the light still on, her eyes staring at Kara's painting
			for hours on end. </p>
		<p>Nana suffered through her bouts of tears in silence. Ginny could not tell her
			what was wrong. Nana had quit asking. She walked around her gently, trying not
			to upset her.</p>
		<p>One night, weeks later, as Ginny lay in bed, tears running down her cheeks,
			Nana came to her.</p>
		<p>"Ginny, what's wrong, child?" she asked gently. "I want to help."</p>
		<p>Ginny turned bruised eyes to Nana. "I'm . . . I'm so lonely," she
			whispered.</p>
		<p>Nana sat on the edge of the bed and brushed her hair, as if soothing a child.
		</p>
		<p>"Why don't you just call?" she asked.</p>
		<p>"Call?"</p>
		<p>"Phil," Nana said gently. </p>
		<p>Ginny cried harder, her shoulders shaking. "Oh, Nana. It's not . . . not
			Phil," she said.</p>
		<p>Nana looked at her, puzzled.</p>
		<p>Ginny couldn't keep it inside any longer. She no longer cared if Nana hated
			her.</p>
		<p>"I miss . . . Kara," she cried.</p>
		<p>"Kara?" </p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, covering her face with her hands.</p>
		<p>"I don't understand," Nana whispered.</p>
		<p>"Kara left . . . because of me," she said.</p>
		<p>"You're not making sense," Nana said. "Why would she leave because of
			you?"</p>
		<p>Ginny took Nana's hand. "Kara and I . . . we . . .." But she couldn't say the
			words. Not to Nana.</p>
		<p>"Ginny? What? What's wrong?"</p>
		<p>"I love her," Ginny whispered.</p>
		<p>Nana frowned. "You're good friends."</p>
		<p>Ginny shook her head. "More than friends, Nana."</p>
		<p>Nana frowned again, her eyes searching Ginny's. "What are you saying,
			child?"</p>
		<p>"We . . .." Ginny closed her eyes. "We were lovers," she whispered softly.
			"I'm in love with her."</p>
		<p>"Ginny?" Nana gasped. "You're not saying . . . that you and Kara?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Nana. I know you don't understand." She opened her eyes, but Nana
			couldn't meet hers. "I didn't know how to tell you."</p>
		<p>"But . . . Phil. You're not . . . like that. Kara's not . . .." But Nana
			stopped. "Is she?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"My God. What did she do to you?" Nana hissed. </p>
		<p>"No. It wasn't her. It was me, Nana." She took Nana's hand, trying to make
			her understand. "Why do you think I ran from Phil? It just wasn't right with
			him. There was no magic. I was looking for that magic that you had with
			Grandpa," she said. "And then I met Kara. And I finally found what I had been
			looking for. She made me feel everything that I'd been missing."</p>
		<p>Nana shook her head. "I don't understand," she said softly. "I just don't
			understand."</p>
		<p>"I know you don't. I wasn't going to tell you." She turned away. "She's gone,
			anyway."</p>
		<p>"She's why you've been hurting?"</p>
		<p>Ginny nodded, tears coming again. "I love her. But I don't think she's coming
			back to me."</p>
