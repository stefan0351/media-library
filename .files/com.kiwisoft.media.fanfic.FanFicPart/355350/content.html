<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Prom Night Preparations -->

<p>"Hurry up, Brooke, or I'm leaving without you," Sam threatened
from outside the bathroom door. Not that she actually would, she was just tired
of waiting around for Brooke to finish getting ready and knowing that they still
had to run the gauntlet of parental units armed with cameras made her cringe. </p>
<p>"You wouldn't dare!" Brooke shouted indignately from inside
the bathroom. Sam grinned. </p>
<p>"Have you seen the limo driver? I mean, sure he's not you but,
yum," she called back. She heard Brooke rushing around the bathroom and
chuckled. (That should get her moving) The bathroom door was suddenly yanked
open and Sam sucked in an unsteady breath. There was Brooke looking more radiant
than Sam had ever seen her, even if her facial expression was slightly peeved. </p>
<p>"I'm finished, happy?" Brooke demanded to know. Sam opened and
closed her mouth, suddenly unable to speak. She'd seen the dress on Brooke
before but with her makeup and hair done, Brooke was positively glowing. Brooke
looked at Sam's stupified expression confused. </p>
<p>"What?" she asked. </p>
<p>"Errr?" Sam managed as inside she screamed at herself to
remember what her native language was. Brooke tilted her head. </p>
<p>"'Errr'? Is that the best you can do?" she teased,
understanding now why Sam was so flustered and flattered by it. </p>
<p>"You look?I mean?wow?and beautiful?gorgeous?and?wow," Sam
stuttered. Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"Wanna try that again in English?" Sam blushed. </p>
<p>"You look terrific," Sam finally said in a coherent sentence.
"Beyond terrific. You are without a doubt the most breathtaking thing I have
ever seen." Now it was Brooke's turn to blush. </p>
<p>"You say the sweetest things," she giggled. Sam kissed her
passionately. </p>
<p>"I speak the truth," Sam told her after the kiss ended.
</p>
<p>"You don't look half bad yourself," Brooke assured her.
</p>
<p>"I look like a goose dressed in peacock feathers next to you,
love," Sam whispered in Brooke's ear, making her shiver. </p>
<p>"We'd better head downstairs before we get carried away,"
Brooke warned. Sam sighed knowing she was right. </p>
<p>"Lead the way, Princess." </p>

<p>Sam was pretty much convinced that you could go blind from
camera flashes by the time she and Brooke reached the last few stairs. Her
mother was just going nuts taking pictures. Sam wondered exactly how much film
the woman had purchased. </p>
<p>"Mom, knock it off before I take a header down the stairs,"
she protested. She heard Brooke snicker behind her. </p>
<p>"Oh, stop being so overly dramatic, Sam," Jane sighed as she
clicked off a few more pictures. "You only have one Senior Prom and I want lots
of pictures to remember it with." Sam rolled her eyes but stayed quiet. Her
mother had a point after all. What surprised her was the fact that Mike was
videotaping the whole thing with the new, highly expensive digital videocamera
he bought after Mac was born. And he looked like he was enjoying the experience
himself. </p>
<p>"You girls look beautiful," Mike said quietly, further
surprising Sam. She looked at Brooke confused. Brooke just smiled and hugged
her. </p>
<p>"I don't know, go with it," she whispered in Sam's ear.
"Thanks Dad," she said louder. </p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks Mike," Sam echoed. She still couldn't cross that
invisible line and call Mike `Dad' and now that she was involved with Brooke for
what looked like the long haul, she doubted she ever would. There was a certain
awkward factor involved. </p>
<p>"So what are your plans for after the prom?" Jane asked as she
switched rolls of film. Sam and Brooke looked at each other. </p>
<p>"Nicole's family has a beachfront house we're all going to go
spend the long weekend at," Brooke explained. Her parents exchanged wary
glances. </p>
<p>"I don't know, girls," Mike started. </p>
<p>"Everyone will be there," Sam interrupted. "Josh and Lily, Nic,
Carmen, Sugar, God help us, even Mary Cherry. Harrison might show too. And there
is absolutely no alcohol in the vicinity. I swear." </p>
<p>"It's going to be our last big blast before graduation,"
Brooke further explained, giving her father her best wounded puppy look. Sam
pouted at her mother. </p>
<p>"And all our stuff is all ready at the house, Mom. Please can
we go?" Unable to resist the twin attacks from their daughters, Jane and Mike
relented. </p>
<p>"All right, but we want your word that there'll be no
drinking," Mike ordered. Sam shot him a look. </p>
<p>"Mike, I think we all learned our lesson reguarding underage
drinking and proms last year," she pointed out, a hint of bitterness creeping
into her tone. Mike nodded. </p>
<p>"OK," Jane hugged both girls. "The limo's out front so you'd
better get going or you'll be late." Mike hugged them as well. </p>
<p>"Have fun you two. And behave," he added. Both girls shot him
devilish smirks. </p>
<p>"Daddy, don't we always?" Brooke asked as she closed the door
behind her. Her laughter mingled with Sam's as they walked down the steps. Mike
turned to Jane. </p>
<p>"That's what I'm afraid of," he sighed. Jane gave him a
supportive pat on the shoulder. </p>
