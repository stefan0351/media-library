<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 8: Out of Time -->

<p>Pacey was pleasantly surprised to see Kaela bouncing happily into the video store as he came back from shelving titles behind the desk. He had been worried about her all night, wondering what would, or wouldn't happen after he dropped her and Joey off... but she certainly wasn't the picture of devastation.</p>
		<p>"Hey Kaela, I see you're smiling again." Pacey couldn't help laughing a little at her impish, childlike grin.</p>
		<p>"Pacey, let's go somewhere fun today! I want to get out of here, Joey's working all day at the Icehouse, and I'm jumping out of my skin."</p>
		<p>"I'd love to, but as you can see, I too am working all day, so I'll have to take a rain check."</p>
		<p>"Come on, Pacey, please, please, please, you know you're just itching to blow this joint. Adolescence is short, maturity is forever."</p>
		<p>Pacey wasn't about to let someone else lecture *him* on the importance of being irresponsible...besides, his curiosity was growing in leaps and bounds.</p>
		<p>"Okay, missy, I'll strike you a bargain: we close this dung heap right now and hit the wild highway, on one condition. You spill your guts about what is giving you that radiant glow."</p>
		<p>Kaela reddened a little, but instead of looking down like she had last night, she stuck her chin out proudly. "In the truck." "Deal."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>They got on 95 north without really giving any thought to what their destination was; Pacey was vaguely thinking of New Hampshire, and Kaela was vaguely thinking of Canada. Impulsively, Kaela rolled down her window and screamed out into the rushing air, releasing some of her pent-up energy. When she pulled herself back in and rolled the window up, Pacey decided it was time he got some information.</p>
		<p>"Okay, mysterious one, you've had your fun. Now what gives?"</p>
		<p>"Oh my god, Pacey, you have no idea."</p>
		<p>"That's not going to do at all, I'm afraid I'll need a staged reenactment."</p>
		<p>"Oh no you don't," Kaela laughed as she shook her finger at him. "I don't kiss and tell."</p>
		<p>"I think you just did." Pacey grinned, shaking his head in disbelief. Who'd have thought Joey had it in her?</p>
		<p>"Shit, I guess I did. Well...I guess I can give you the basics, but no details."</p>
		<p>"Right, Cap'n."</p>
		<p>"Okay, so. ...It was really tense for a while, I was all clammed up and she had no idea what was going on...so after about half an hour of fidgeting and stalling, I...I kissed her."</p>
		<p>"Wow, you sure don't beat around the bush."</p>
		<p>Kaela hit him on the arm, her shyness kicking in a little. "Do you want to hear this, or what?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I'm sorry, go ahead, no more heckling."</p>
		<p>"Good. Well after that it was weird again for a while...we decided to play truth or dare, with no dare, which was just basically an easier way of saying let's get all the skeletons out of the closet."</p>
		<p>"Out of the closet, that's good!"</p>
		<p>"Pacey!"</p>
		<p>"Sorry, sorry, I couldn't leave it alone..."</p>
		<p>"All right, I'll give you that one, I set myself up for it, but now you *must* shut up."</p>
		<p>Pacey nodded, mimicking zipping his lip and throwing away the key.</p>
		<p>"So," Kaela continued, a little awkwardly, "we did that for a while, and it got really weird and intense, and then she kissed me." Kaela stopped for a moment in case Pacey was planning another jab, but this time he stayed silent, true to his word.</p>
		<p>"And then...we, uh, we...well, the game was over."</p>
		<p>"That's great, Kaela," Pacey finally said after a moment of silence. Crazy but great. He still couldn't believe that Joey had done it. He tried very hard to keep his mind from wandering to what the two of them might have done...</p>
		<p>"I mean, it took Dawson his entire life to kiss that girl, and you managed to pull it off in one night." Kaela' face fell at the mention of Dawson's name.</p>
		<p>"That's the screwed up part, Pacey! I'm the other woman, well, sort of, I mean I'm messing up a perfect relationship! How am I ever going to look Dawson in the face again?"</p>
		<p>"I'm no expert at love triangles," Pacey sighed, "but if it had been perfect, you wouldn't have been able to mess it up."</p>
		<p>"That's not so comforting."</p>
		<p>"Well then, what would be comforting?"</p>
		<p>"Joey naked." Kaela slapped her hand over her mouth, unable to believe what she'd just said. Pacey, for once, was flabbergasted into silence, and Kaela just laughed.</p>
		<p>"My my, you are getting ballsy," Pacey observed when he had recovered.</p>
		<p>"I feel like I'm on top of the world, Pacey," Kaela sighed euphorically, twirling a lock of her hair between her fingers.</p>
		<p>"I know how dumb and cliched that sounds, but it's just true. Every time I move, it reminds me of her hands on me, of being close to her. I...I just can't believe anyone could want me like that."</p>
		<p>Pacey didn't say anything in reply, a little hurt that she'd forgotten about his advances so quickly. But he brushed it aside, since, after all, it was better for her not to worry about having any sexual tension with him-- they were friends.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Kaela had only just gotten home from her day trip with Pacey when the phone rang. She was still floating in a layer of sweetness and sunshine, and she picked up the phone expecting nothing but good news.</p>
		<p>"Hello?"</p>
		<p>"Kaela...can you come over?"</p>
		<p>"Joey," Kaela's voice fell to a soft, near-whisper, "why are you crying?"</p>
		<p>"I told Dawson, and...everything just went wrong, I..." her voice choked over a sob, and Kaela felt like she was in a hot air balloon that had just popped; for a moment, it was suspended in high, thin air, and then she started to fall. "I just need you," Joey finished when she caught her breath. "Can you come over?"</p>
		<p>"Of course," Kaela said quickly, without even thinking about it. She was supposed to watch the kids tonight, but she'd just have to leave her mother a note saying that she had an emergency with a friend and she had to go. "I'll be there in twenty minutes, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay," Joey said shakily, and Kaela ran to the kitchen to scribble a quick note and tack it to the fridge. Then she shot out the door, grabbing her coat as she ran.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>When she got to Joey's house, Bessie answered the door. "Hi," Kaela said a little uneasily.</p>
		<p>"I'm glad you came over, Kaela," Bessie said warmly, leading her inside. "She's so upset, but she won't say a word to me. I guess there are some things you just can't talk about with your sister..."</p>
		<p>Kaela felt a rising panic in her stomach; what was Bessie implying? Did she know something?</p>
		<p>"I know she had a big fight with Dawson, they might have broken up, I can't tell. Just try to convince her there are other good things in life, okay?"</p>
		<p>"Um, sure," Kaela nodded, swallowing the dry feeling in her throat. "I'll try." Kaela darted through the kitchen as quickly as possible, feeling terribly self-conscious. She knocked tentatively on Joey's door, suddenly nervous. "Jo?" she murmured quietly through the wood. "It's me."</p>
		<p>The door flew open, as if Joey had been sitting in front of it waiting. Her face was puffy and streaked with tears, and for a moment neither of them spoke, both suddenly unsure of themselves, doubting where they stood.</p>
		<p>Joey's lip quivered with fresh tears, and Kaela felt her own heart break for Joey's. She couldn't stand watching Joey cry, so she put her arms around her and hugged her fiercely, feeling Joey's tears rock her own body.</p>
		<p>"It's okay," Kaela whispered, and kissed her lightly below her ear. Joey pulled back suddenly, yanking Kaela with her and slamming the door shut all in one motion.</p>
		<p>"Sorry," Kaela said meekly, looking down at her feet.</p>
		<p>"No," Joey sighed as she wiped the tears off her cheeks, "you don't need to be sorry. It's weird to just be making up the rules as we go along."</p>
		<p>"Yeah," Kaela murmured. "I guess I don't really know what I'm doing."</p>
		<p>"I obviously don't either," Joey sighed, pressing her hand to her forehead as in she were in pain. "God, I screwed everything up so bad..."</p>
		<p>Kaela wanted to keep telling her it was okay, but it felt like a lie. So she just hugged her instead, and Joey melted into her comforting arms.</p>
		<p>"I'm here for you, Joey," Kaela whispered, running one hand through her hair, soothing her as best she knew how. "Sssh, we'll make it though, whatever happens." Kaela thought it was a little ironic how quickly the tables had turned; last night she had been in a thousand pieces and Joey had put her back together. Now it was the other way around-- she just hoped she could do it was well as Joey had.</p>
		<p>"Maybe I *am* selfish," Joey said finally when she recovered her breath from crying. "Maybe I'm just a terrible person...I cheated on him, Kaela, I swore I'd never cheat on anyone after my dad did it to my mother."</p>
		<p>"Sweetheart," Kaela shook her head, "your parents were adults, they were married, they had a responsibility to each other that was based on a life they'd made together. We're just kids...and that doesn't mean we should go around just doing whatever we want all the time, but it does mean we're going to be confused a lot, and experiences are going to come along that we didn't necessarily anticipate. Remember what you told me last night? If not now, when?" Kaela wiped the tears off Joey's cheeks as she spoke.</p>
		<p>"...If you weren't so damn cute, I wouldn't be in all this trouble," Joey said finally. "I wasn't ready for this...it hit me so fast. With Dawson, it was just always there, I'd been in love with him for so long it was all I knew, I forgot what it felt like in the beginning, all that discovery."</p>
		<p>"Yeah?" Kaela said uncertainly, not knowing where Joey was going.</p>
		<p>"It's just so different now...all of a sudden, there you were, and...and I..." she sniffled and pulled Kaela closer, running her hands through her tousled hair. "I just feel so good with you, I don't want to think it could be bad."</p>
		<p>"It's not bad, Joey," Kaela whispered, taking one of Joey's hands from her hair and kissing it. "The only thing that keeps my family together is love. I trust that. I have to...what else is there?"</p>
		<p>Joey answered her with a hungry kiss, pushing her down on the bed. Clothes fell in a heap on the floor, in their eagerness to get their hands on each other, and they didn't pay attention to the unlocked door. Although Joey was normally cautious, the past two days had been so confusing that she just couldn't think straight, and she didn't even hear the approaching footsteps.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, the door flew open.</p>
