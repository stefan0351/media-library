<!-- Secret Desires \ Part 6 -->

<p>Brooke couldn't sleep.  She was up half the night tossing and
			turning, visions of Shannon and Sam popping into her head. When her
			alarm went off, she turned it off and headed for the shower hoping
			to dispel her current mood. She thought of all the things that
			Shannon said and what she was going to do about it. But somehow she
			kept coming up with the same answer:</p>
		<p>"Nothing." </p>
		<p>Brooke knew she wanted Sam and she was definitely admitting it
			now. But she wasn't sure if she was willing to risk everything that
			she had and had ever wanted. She wasn't even sure if Sam would be
			interested anyway. So, with a sigh, she realized that all she could
			do was wait and see what happened.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Looking in the mirror, she rubbed her face and shook her head.</p>
		<p>"I look like I haven't had sleep in weeks." She
			jumped
			slightly at the sound of Sam's voice as Sam entered the room.  She
			turned to face her as Sam walked right up to her with a worried look.</p>
		<p>Sam had walked in and was about to turn and leave when she
			realized Brooke was still occupying the bathroom until she noticed
			the dark circles around her eyes and that the normally vibrant
			blonde was looking very drawn and pale. </p>
		<p>"Are you OK, Brooke?" she practically ran to the
			blonde's
			side. She brought her hand up to check for fever and looked closely
			in to Brooke's eyes "What's wrong? Are you sick?"</p>
		<p>Brooke gave what she hoped was a reassuring smile as she reached
			up and took Sam's hand away from her forehead.  Although she was
			loving the attention, she didn't want Sam to worry.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine Sam, really. I just didn't get any sleep. I had
			a
			lot on my mind." </p>
		<p>At Sam's still worried look she went on.</p>
		<p>"Really Sam, I'm just a little tired." </p>
		<p>Sam just looked at her a little skeptical and shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Why didn't you sleep? What was on your mind? Anything I
			can
			help you with?" The brunette was a little worried. Brooke wasn't
			acting like herself lately and she could tell the blonde had been
			upset yesterday.  She and Shannon seemed to have wanted to pounce on
			each other, then she just left and didn't come back until late. Sam
			had heard her come in but the slamming of the doors and the
			frustrated sighs told her that Brooke needed some space and she
			probably didn't want company. But Sam didn't want Brooke to feel
			alone. She knew that sometimes the blonde didn't deal well with
			pressure so she wanted it to be clear that she would help in anyway
			that she could and to make sure that the blonde knew that she wasn't
			alone.</p>
		<p>Brooke didn't know what to say so she opted for part of the truth.</p>
		<p>"I don't want you to worry. I've just been thinking a lot.
			Having a secret admirer just made me miss having someone to be
			with.  Not that I miss Josh, it's just that I miss the relationship
			part. I miss all the sweet and fun things you do with someone.  I
			love the way that poem made me feel." </p>
		<p>She smiled even brighter.</p>
		<p>"I want to feel wanted and needed like that poem made me
			feel.  I want passion and romance," she trailed off as she imagined
			her and Sam sitting together with candles all around them.  Then she
			shook her head and laughed a little and looked away embarrassed that
			she went on like that.  At least she left out the part where she
			wanted all that with Sam. She figured Sam would be a little freaked
			out to say the least.</p>
		<p>"You must think I'm weird to lose sleep over such trivial
			things," as Brooke looked up she noticed that Sam was smiling and
			had a far off look on her face.</p>
		<p>Sam noticed the way Brooke seemed to get a little of her normal
			vibrant character back when she talked about her secret admirer and
			it made her smile to think that it was because of her. Sam shook her
			head and went on to reassure the blonde.</p>
		<p>"No, Brooke, not at all. I've lost sleep over my favorite
			television reporter being
			fired. What you have on your mind is a very important issue.  We all
			get lonely and then dwell on it. I have done it many times." </p>
		<p>Brooke gave Sam a 100 watt smile and then turned back toward the
			mirror and started to try and hide the evidence of not sleeping with
			a thick layer of Max Factor. But she kept looking from herself to
			the beautiful brunette still standing behind her. When she was done
			she turned back to Sam.  Hoping to get the spotlight off her, she
			changed the subject.</p>
		<p>"So, do you think my secret admirer is cute?  And do you
			think that he will write me more poetry?" she asked in an almost
			giddy voice.</p>
		<p>Sam couldn't help but wonder how Brooke could still look
			absolutely beautiful without any sleep and being slightly stressed
			out. </p>
		<p>"I don't know if you would consider him cute, but I do
			know
			that if he saw the way you light up when you think about his poems,
			and that there was a slim chance to get a smile from you that he
			would write you a poem every chance he got." Sam finished with a
			slight blush.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>They stared into each others eyes for a few more moments then Sam
			cleared her throat.</p>
		<p>"Well, I better be getting ready for school.  Lily will
			be
			waiting out front for me." She awkwardly left the bathroom to get
			the clothes that she wanted to wear and decided she really needed to
			talk to Lily.  Because if romance was all it would take to make
			Brooke happy, then she was going to give it to her, even if someone
			else was getting the credit for it.</p>
