<P>It had been two years since the Cornwall game and, Olivia and Sebastian had amazingly survived, as a couple. They had outlasted Duke and Viola who had broken up about 4 months ago, and neither was willing to reveal why, how or who broke whom, they both didn't want to talk about it. Which was something Olivia and Sebastian had in common with the perfect couple, recently re-dubbed the perfect singles. They couldn't communicate, with each other or others about each other, with their progression from high school to Collage, Sebastian had become obsessed with his music. He would respond to almost anything with a positive answer, just to go back on his word. At times Olivia couldn't understand why she was still with him, now was one of those times.</p>
<P>"Sebastian! Can you hear me?" asked Olivia waving her hand in front of Sebastian's face, he strummed a few cords then looked up at her.</p>
<P>"I heard what you said", he replied, looking at her with annoyance, she was throwing off his latest song.</p>
<P>"Okay. What did I say, Sebastian?" said Olivia, crossing her arms, he strummed a few more cords.</p>
<P>"Something about having to go somewhere for something, that would make everything better BLAH BLAH", said Sebastian fiddling with his guitar when the cord didn't sound right.</p>
<P>"Will you please stop playing with that! I'm trying to have a conversation with you", said Olivia.</p>
<P>"Well I'm trying to play my music, so if you'll excuse me", said Sebastian putting his head down again to fiddle with the guitar.</p>
<P>Olivia snatched it from him.</p>
<P>"If you want this relationship to work your going to come", she said, throwing the guitar and a piece of paper, with the details of the class on it, back at him. Sebastian just caught the guitar and the piece of paper fluttered into his open hand.</p>
<P>Olivia stormed out of the room, slamming the door to of the apartment as she left. Sebastian sighed and read the paper, putting it down as he went back to his guitar.</p>
<P>Viola was working in the Starbucks Coffee shop, cleaning off the table she lifted her head up, to see Sebastian standing over her, with a pleading look on his face.</p>
<P>"I'm not giving you any more money", she said immediately, moving to the next table to clean it off.</p>
<P>"I'm not asking you too", said Sebastian moving with her. Viola looked up and gave him the 'you've got to be kidding' look.</p>
<P>"No, seriously I just need your help with one thing", said Sebastian,putting his hands together and pouteing.</p>
<P>"Please", he begged quivering his lower lip.</p>
<P>Viola threw her cleaning towel on him.</p>
<P>"Okay, just stop that. What do you want?" she asked, as her brother pulled the damp towel off his head.</p>
<P>Producing the flier Olivia had given him the night before, he handed it to Viola.</p>
<P>"I have to go to this", he said.</p>
<P>Viola read it and cringed.</p>
<P>"Couple theory, with the added enjoyment of soccer", she read, trying to control her laughter.</p>
<P>"I know it sucks..." started Sebastian, but Viola cut him off.</p>
<P>"Sucks, Sebastian my dear brother, you are in total shit", said Viola putting an arm around her brother.</p>
<P>"If a girl enrolls you in couple's theory, you are this close to getting the flick", said Viola leaving a small gab between her pressed fingers.</p>
<P>"Really? Well then you got to help me", said Sebastian, getting very nervous at the thought of being dumped.</p>
<P>"Alright what do you need?" asked Viola.</p>
<P>"Well I wanted you to tell Olivia I couldn't make it but she'll..." Sebastian finished the sentence by copying Viola's action.</p>
<P>Viola nodded.</p>
<P>"So now I don't know what to do", said Sebastian sitting on the table. Viola looked at him with pity, he really had no clue. He looked up at his sister as she put a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<P>"You said you'd help me right?" asked Sebastian, Viola nodded then wished she hadn't when Sebastian smiled his mischievous smile. This wasn't going to be good.</p>
<P>"Your going to be me", said Sebastian, jumping up excitedly. And before Viola could complain or argue he was out the door.</p>
<P>"Thanks sis you just answered my prays", said Sebastian running out of the shop.</p>
<P>"That... that won't work", yelled Viola after him, but he was already gone.</p>
<P><I>'Damn'</I>, she thought, throwing the towel onto the table.</p>
<P><B>Authors Note: tell me what you think... Read and Review... Next chapter will Viola go through with it? Will Olivia recognize her? And what does Sebastian have to do that is so important? Read and review whilst I think... </B></p>
