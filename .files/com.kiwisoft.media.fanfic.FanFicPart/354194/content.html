<!-- Temporary Sweetener \ Part 5 -->

<p>Buffy carefully closed the door to bedroom before turning around to  be ensnared in Cordelia's arms once again, the brunette immediately  leaning forward bring their lips together once more.  By the time  they had made it back inside of the house the gang had decided to  call it a night, and for this a certain Slayer and diviner were  extremely grateful.  After their adventures in the Summers' backyard  the last thing either one of them wanted to have to do was make small  talk.</p>

<p>"We have to be quiet," Buffy managed to mumble, her eyes closing as  Cordelia kissed her way down her neck, and began to work her hand  under the Slayer's shirt.  "Dawn and Willow are just across the ha …  ha … hall," she continued feeling Cordelia smile against the skin of  her shoulder as her breath hitched in her throat and she struggled to  get the rest of her words out.</p>

<p>"Okay," the brunette whispered back a moment later, her hands  settling on the blonde's hips, her lips attaching themselves to the  spot behind Buffy's ear working the soft skin with her tongue, her  heart skipping a beat at the sound her actions caused to erupt from  the Slayer's mouth.  "Is there anything else?" she continued, her  mouth hovering beside Buffy's ear.</p>

<p>"Yeah," the Slayer responded a smile of her own now spreading across  her face.  "Take off your shirt."</p>

<p>How they found their way to the bed neither of them would later be  able to remember, and how the rest of Cordelia's clothes were shed,  to be quickly followed by Buffy's, without them ever breaking  contact, they could only contribute to divine intervention.  But  somehow, someway they did end up spread across Buffy's bed, their  clothes discarded, Buffy's body draped over Cordelia's, covering her  like a blanket, moaning softly at the first contact of their naked  bodies as the Slayer rubbed her body along the brunette's lithe  frame.  And then the Slayer was kissing her, her hands resting on the  ex-cheerleaders hips as the brunette trailed her own hands over the  smooth expanse of Buffy's skin, desperately tugging and clawing,  trying to draw the Slayer closer to her.  Because everywhere they  touched, every place where their bodies were in contact with other  they felt fire.  </p>

<p>"Uhhhh," Cordelia moaned, biting down on her lip as the moan started  to erupt from her throat.  Her heels were digging into the mattress  as Buffy's mouth captured one of her already painfully erect nipples  and began to suck, her other hand manipulating Cordelia's other  breast as the brunette's hands bunched themselves in fists around the  bed sheets.  The brunette's mouth flew open, a long drawn out moan  that she just couldn't contain tearing from her throat as the  Slayer's lips, teeth, and fingers continued to attack her nipples.   Freeing themselves of the bed sheets, Cordelia's hands came to tangle  themselves in Buffy's hair holding her head in place as her chest  arched up into the blonde's mouth, begging for more of whatever she  was willing to give.</p>

<p>Buffy pressed her lips to Cordelia's pulse point sucking on it hard  as her hand caressed the inside of Cordelia's thigh.  Her nails ran  lightly across the tanned skin of Cordelia's leg as she pressed  herself closer to brunette even though there was no place left for  her to go.  Cordelia arched up into Buffy, blindly seeking out her  lips, which Buffy gladly gave over to her, groaning as the brunette  sucked her tongue into her mouth, kissing her fervently.  </p>

<p>The only thing that Buffy was aware of was the sound of Cordelia's  voice — the soft sounds she was making in the back of her throat and  the sound of her name coming out of her mouth in ragged, desire  filled gasps — and the sound of her own breathing.  The body beneath  hers was now moving in a frenzy, a blur of activity as Buffy  continued to move her hand in and out, her lips and her free hand  caressing and exploring every and all available patches of skin.  And  then she felt it.  Cordelia's body tensed, her breath hitching one  last time before wave after wave of pleasure ripped through her body,  taking her breath away.  And as Cordelia surged against her, forcing  her further in, Buffy pressed herself down onto the brunette one last  time before she too lost the ability to make sound all together.</p>
