<!-- Darkness and Light \ Chapter 18 -->

<p>Upon waking Faith was confused, not because she didn't know
where she was but because she knew exactly where she was, and that had
never happened before. The sensations were not new in and of
themselves, lying in a warm bed, waking up with another person in the
bed with her. Of course there were subtle differences. In stead of the
smell of old sweat and sex there was just the smell of Buffy. Faith
wasn't terribly surprised, while the idea of being with Buffy had been
in her head along time by the time they had gotten back from the ruins
of the Initiative they were so exhausted all they had the energy to do
was strip, shower, and get into bed. They actually probably didn't
even have the strength to shower, but they were both coated with the
smell of sweat, demon blood and gunpowder. While the first one was
nice, the second two had to go.</p>

<p>However the differences did not end with just the sweet smell
inherent to Buffy Summers. There was also the feeling of the body
pressed up against hers. Now it was not the first time Faith had woken
up with someone else, it was not even the first time she had awakened
with someone else on top of her like Buffy was, but it was usually the
result of one or both of them passing out after sex. Buffy was
different, she was cuddled on top of Faith, as it the dark haired
slayer were a favorite pillow, or a stuffed animal, and she drew
comfort from the contact, and Faith found she did as well. The last
difference was that she did know. Normally when she woke up, alone or
with someone else she had to find her bearings, unless of course it
was her slayer senses waking her up.</p>

<p>With Buffy however, she knew, right away she knew who she was,
where she was, and who was laying with her. Perhaps it WAS her slayer
senses detecting the presence of the other slayer, or maybe it was far
simpler. Something on some instinctive level knew the smell,
recognized the warmth put off by the tiny blonde frame, the silky
softness that was yet firm and strong, just KNEW all the things that
made up Buffy and recognized them faster then her conscious mind ever
could. Of course Faith usually didn't bother much with deep
introspection and simply allowed the wide smile to cross her face when
her conscious mind realized. "I'm holding Buffy Summers, because she
loves me and I love her." Of course the fact that Buffy had not been
able to return to her dorm room yet gave Faith the sensation of
Buffy's skin against hers with no interruption. </p>

<p>She idly wondered it she could get to the room before Buffy
and hide all her pajamas. "What are you smiling about?" The voice was
sleepy, but smiling as Faith looked down and realized that she was
indeed smiling. "You." She leaned down and tenderly kissed the blondes
lips repeatedly. Buffy smiled happily. "Me too." Faith smirked.
"Smiling about yourself, guess I should not be surprised." Buffy
huffed and rolled off of Faith. With out fail the other slayer rolled
as well and ended up on top of Buffy. Buffy smirked up at her. "Just
wanted to see if you'd follow." Faith's smile vanished to be replaced
by a look that was both solemn and tender. "Always." She leaned in and
kissed Buffy again, but longer, slower, and when it broke Buffy
reached up and cupped Faith's cheek. "I love you." Faith smiled. "I
love you too."</p>

<p>Buffy then pouted and paused that caused Faith to look
confused. "Something wrong B?" Buffy looked back into her eyes. "Just
waiting for the knock on the door." Faith shrugged and laid her head
back down against Buffy's stomach, and that's how they waited, and
waited, and waited. "B, I don't think there is going to be a knock."
"You think something's wrong?" Faith sighed into Buffy's abdomen.
"That, or they are just trying to give us some privacy. Well that or
maybe Xander drilled a hole in the wall and is watching us. Buffy's
stomach muscles shook with laughter under Faith's cheek as Faith
smiled. "Still, I guess they are guests and all. So I suppose we
better look in on them." Faith seemed regretful while Buffy seemed
relived, but she did notice Faith's expression. "Sorry, guess I'm just
making you earn it." Faith paused. "Making ME earn it? Who's the one
that knocked me down and mounted me?" Buffy blushed and looked down
while muttering. "I only did that once."</p>

<p>"Whose the one who suggested we sleep together naked?" Buffy
continued to look down and Faith smirked as she gave the blonde a
playful swat on the butt. "Buffy Summers, you are as bad as I am. I
hope you know that." Buffy looked like she was about to object, but
then reconsidered and stepped close to the now half clothed Faith.
"That's just because you corrupted me." Faith gave Buffy a blank look.
"Yeah, so?" Buffy grinned as she wrapped her arms around Faith's waist
and stretched up to steal a kiss. "I hadn't said thank you." Faith
grinned back at her as she gave another kiss. "You're welcome." The
two broke apart and finished dressing, holding hands as they walked to
the living room.</p>

<p>There they found everyone except Willow and Tara. While they
all looked refreshed from a goodnight's sleep they also seemed to be
suffering from being away from home, the men showed signs of stubble
and all of them looked rumpled. Buffy looked at Faith and then at the
group. "Well, the Initiative's been shut back down… Riley's been
destroyed." They all looked sad at that point and Faith gave Buffy's
hand a squeeze as Xander spoke. "Are we just going to let Spike get
away with turning him?" Buffy looked at the floor. "Riley tried to
play with an animal and it bit him." Faith slipped her arm around
Buffy's waist. "If someone puts their hand in the kennel of an attack
dog and they get bit do you blame them or the dog?" Xander seemed to
nod reluctantly as Giles spoke. "Are we sure Spike has been muzzled
again?"</p>

<p>Faith was the one to answer that question. "Yeah and he seems
to have accepted it. He's even willing to help us out." They all
seemed skeptical as Faith grinned. "No, Giles said it best. Spike
needs protection from all the demons he's pissed off, and as long as
he has the chip they are the only things he can beat on." Faith then
seemed to blush as she spoke. "That and he's lonely. I mean the other
demons won't have anything to do with him, so he needs somebody."
Buffy's eyebrows suddenly shot up and she looked at Faith. The dark
haired slayer grinned. "He offered and I turned him down." Buffy's
mouth had set into a determined line, but Faith simply grinned as she
leaned in and kissed her. "Come on B, can you blame him? You have to
realize your dating a hottie. I mean just think about what I'm going
to have to go through. Not only will the college GUYS be after you,
but I'm willing to bet the girls will be chasing that tail once they
find out you've started swinging from both sides of the plate."</p>

<p>As Buffy blushed deeply she saw that Giles was looking
entirely uncomfortable while Xander was looking entirely TOO
interested; Anya had fallen back asleep against Xander's shoulder.
Faith noticed that and smirked at Xander. "I guess that long night of
sleeping took more out of her then we thought." Xander grinned
slightly as he looked down at his sleeping girlfriend, but before he
was able to answer two bleary eyed Wiccan's shuffled into the living
room. Faith smirked at them as well. "Ladies! Have a pleasant night?"
The pair blushed and Faith's smirk grew, but before she was able to
continue Giles spoke up. "Well, as Buffy was about to say matter has
been wrapped up and we can finally get home." As the Watcher stood and
seemed ready to leave Willow perked up. "Oh, can you give us a ride
back to the dorms?" </p>

<p>He nodded. "Are you ready?" The girls seemed to look at each
other as Willow spoke. "Just a sec, we need to go grab a few things
from our room." Xander then gently shook Anya awake. "Could we get a
ride with you too?" Giles seemed reluctant but nodded Xander noticed
the look. "Giles, I hate to say it, but you REALLY need to get a new
car. With all the damage that one has suffered one of these days the
rest of us will be fighting a demon while you are sitting on the side
of the road." Giles nodded, "I fear you are correct." Xander motioned
Anya to follow him back, but before they left he spoke over his
shoulder to Faith. "CAN I keep the military gear here?" Faith sighed
and nodded. "Yeah, yeah, just be sure it's hidden and packed safely
away."</p>

<p>Xander nodded as he and Anya walked off. Giles looked at the
girls. "There is still the matter of the police." They all sighed.
"Sleepover?" Then they all nodded. Giles sighed again. "When we leave
I will just tell the police we are getting clothing for several days."
Faith gave the Watcher a playful smirk. "What? Getting sick of me
already?" At first he did not notice the smirk, but his expression
changed when he saw Buffy give her partner a playful nudge. "Yes, well
it is not your presence as much as it is the absence of my own bed and
my own flat." Faith smiled and nodded. "Yeah, there's no place like
home, but we'll have you back in no time… Dorothy." </p>

<p>Giles looked offended, but Buffy spoke before he was able to.
"I always thought of Giles more as Auntie Em." The Englishman looked
even more offended, but this time Faith was the one to cut him off.
"Oh great, now I am going to have a bunch fantasies with you as the
role of Dorothy." Buffy looked amused. "So who would that make you?
You bathe too often to be the wicked witch." Faith stepped close to
Buffy and gave her a kiss. "I was thinking more about being the
wizard, and dragging Dorothy behind the curtain." "What curtain?" They
all turned to see Willow and Tara rejoin them and Faith answered the
question. "Oh we were just seeing which Scooby is like which character
from the Wizard of Oz." The rest of the group seemed to tense up and
look at a confused Faith and an equally confused Willow. Then Willow
seemed to realize what they were worried about.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's ok. Oz is in my past. It's not like before when it
hurt to even say his name." They all relaxed as Willow continued.
"Well, you've got two witches, but neither of us is wicked." Faith
gave both the witches a leer. "Right." They both blushed at each
other. Xander and Anya returned. "Did I hear naughty talk?" They all
through a look at Xander and he shrugged as Giles spoke. "There's our
Cowardly Lion." Xander looked both confused and offended as Buffy
stepped up and put an arm over his shoulder. "AFTER he found his
courage." He smiled, and kept smiling as Buffy dropped her arm and
spoke to everyone. "Ok, Giles brought up the point of the cops. The
fact is they don't know that the problem is taken care of. So they
expect to keep protecting us. So what we are going to do is have a
several day sleep over, but Giles is going to drive everyone to get
their clothes and stuff."</p>

<p>Willow nodded and as she spoke Tara nodded with her. "I'll go
get our homework." Xander then spoke up. "I'll be in charge of the
normal nutritional … stuff." They all smirked at him as he grinned.
Giles spoke as well. "And I will make plans to bring over the training
equipment." As the rest of the Scoobies moved off to the car they were
discussing the logistics of fitting everyone inside. When they had
heard the car sputter away Faith spoke to herself. "It can't be that
easy." Buffy looked at her curiously. "What can't?" Faith looked at
Buffy. "Forgiveness, I mean I know the road to redemption is a long
one, but this was such a big step, and it just seems to easy." Buffy
slipped behind the brunette and hugged her waist. "I don't know how
easy it was. A lot of things happened." Faith seemed ready to speak,
but Buffy just squeezed her tighter.</p>

<p>"Faith, you are NOT responsible for Riley. He is the one who
put all his insecurities on you. The only other thing you have done
was kiss me, and I hope you don't regret that." Faith smiled shyly.
"As long as you don't." She then found herself turned around in the
smaller woman's arms. "I don't. In fact, I want to do it again." They
both grinned as Buffy arched up to capture her lips and her mouth
willingly surrendered. The kiss continued and started to deepen.
Faith felt Buffy's hands move to her waist. It started as a gentle
caress, but the touches grew more insistent the longer they kissed.
Soon Buffy was clawing at the waist of her jeans. While she thought
about heading to the bedroom the couch was much closer, and Faith
couldn't wait. She allowed the smaller slayer to push her back against
the couch, and as she rested there she felt her jeans coming
unfastened.</p>
