<!-- What a Difference a Day Makes \ Story -->

<p>The morning sun filtered through
the falling water as sapphire eyes blinked open. The comforting feeling of waking
up with Gabrielle in her arms put an immediate smile on the strong face, tending
to soften the otherwise angular features. It had been far too long since she
remembered feeling this contented upon rising. Gently kissing the soft crown
of golden silk she whispered, &quot;I love you Gabrielle; last night was beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm,&quot; came the reply
from the small woman nestled in her warrior&#146;s arms. Shifting her body slightly
and squeezing a little tighter, she repeated the utterance, &quot;Hmmm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have a busy day ahead
of us, my love, please wake up.&quot; The warrior pleaded, as only her bard
would ever hear her do. </p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but Xena,&quot; Gabrielle
whined, &quot;It&#146;s soooo cozy. Do I really have to leave this comfort so
soon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#146;m afraid so. We
need to get started if we&#146;re to make it to the village before nightfall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know we could just
walk through that portal,&quot; Gabrielle pointed in the direction of the enchanted
forest Aphrodite made for them to use, &quot;and be at the village in a heartbeat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any other time perhaps,
but today we have a side trip to make or did you forget that we&#146;re dinarless?&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, that did kind of
slip my mind. Okay, you win &#150; I&#146;m getting up. But I want it noted
that it&#146;s only under duress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Duly noted, my love, duly
noted.&quot; The warrior smiled again, giving her bard a tender squeeze before
relinquishing her hold and rolling off the soft bed. <i>It&#146;s nice to have
friends in High places.</i></p>
<p>While Gabrielle fought with
herself to disengage from the warmth of the skins, Xena peaked out around the
falls to see if Eve was anywhere in sight.</p>
<p>It seemed that, once again,
the young woman proved to be her mother&#146;s daughter. She was indeed sitting
near the water&#146;s edge. In fact, she had brought the entire camp down with
her and there was already a fire burning strong. Xena detected the faint odor
of herbs mixed with the pungent odor of fish cooking and her stomach made an
involuntary grumble.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurry up, Gabrielle, Eve
has breakfast started,&quot; she yelled back into the cave.</p>
<p>&quot;Breakfast. Now there&#146;s
a reason to rush.&quot; The small blonde came up behind Xena and placed her
arms around the warrior&#146;s waist. The taller woman felt the warmth of her
lover&#146;s skin against hers and goose bumps involuntarily covered her entire
body.</p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle, the idea is
to get ready and be down at the lake before midday.&quot; She gently pried her
lover&#146;s eager arms from around her waist and turned the blonde around to
face her, gazing down into still sleepy sea-green eyes. Her heart melted, as
was the case every time she looked at her lover&#146;s face. Gabrielle smiled
sweetly, while inwardly she gloated, knowing the effect she had on the tall
dark beauty and relishing in the knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, my Warrior.
You felt marvelous last night.&quot; She smiled seductively, &quot;Could I talk
you into a morning replay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are incorrigible!
What Am I going to do with you?&quot; There was no holding back a smile as Gabrielle
pressed closer. Xena could feel the texture of her bard&#146;s erect nipples
as they made contact with the skin beneath her own breasts. Small hands reached
up to entreat her warrior&#146;s to follow suit.</p>
<p>&quot;For starters you could
kiss me.&quot; Gabrielle whispered as she placed her mouth over her lover&#146;s
breast, allowing a free hand to roam southward to her warrior&#146;s mound.
</p>
<p>Xena could feel Gabrielle smile
as her fingers reached the area that was already moist beneath the dark curls.
</p>
<p>The raven-haired beauty leaned
down and gracefully picked her love up into her arms, kissing her passionately.
&quot;You know I will run your lovely ass off the rest of the day trying to
make up for the time we&#146;re going to lose traveling this morning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will be well worth
the consequences to spend the few extra minutes with you here this morning,
my love. But, we&#146;re not really on a time schedule. What difference could
one more day make? &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Always up for bartering,
aren&#146;t you?&quot; Xena laughingly chided the bard.</p>
<p>She knew Gabrielle was right
though, there really was no hurry. It wouldn&#146;t hurt any of them to relax
another day by the lake, act like a real family, and just enjoy nature and all
she had to offer. None of them knew the reception they would receive when they
did finally enter Amazon territory. </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, you convinced me.
Should I yell down to Eve and let her know we&#146;re all right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No Xena, I&#146;m sure
she realizes that we might &#145;sleep&#146; a little later today.&quot; Again
the warrior received a knowing smile, as she deposited her precious cargo back
onto the still warm bed.</p>
<p>At first the lovers just lay
next to one another, each drinking in the beauty of the vision before them.
Slowly, fingers began to simultaneously dance on skin. Xena&#146;s hand roamed
the outline of her lover&#146;s form, while Gabrielle&#146;s played on the inner
sphere of the body before her, delicately tracing circles around her lover&#146;s
navel then slowly letting her fingers drift down to the dark curly mound below
Xena&#146;s abdomen. </p>
<p>Gabrielle smiled when she thought
about the woman she loved, the one so different from the person known to the
rest of the world as the warrior princess. Her fingers caressed the soft skin
between her lover&#146;s thighs, stroking the strong muscles that could crush
with a vengeance the neck of a foe, or melt into liquid under the love spell
of a small bard.</p>
<p>Each of the women drank in the
elegance of the other, each trying desperately to recapture precious time that
had been stolen from them. When they could stand it no longer, they allowed
the passion to unfold as it had the evening before and let the lullaby of the
dancing falls intensify their desire for each other.</p>
<p>A few candlemarks later, sexually
satisfied yet famished in other ways, they unwrapped from each other&#146;s
bodies and sat on the bed.</p>
<p>&quot;So do you think we could
manage to show some facsimile of a normal existence for the next few hours,&quot;
Xena joked over at the fair-haired maid sharing her bed. </p>
<p>&quot;I think that might be
accomplished now that at least one of my hungers has been appeased. You know
I think every once in a while we deserve to take a day or two just for ourselves
and seeing how we haven&#146;t done so in longer than I care to state &#150;
yesterday and today rightfully belong to us.&quot; She snuggled over next to
the warm body that had been surrounding her as the sun went from low on the
horizon to where it stood now at it&#146;s noonday mark. &quot;I do think Eve
might just be getting a little perturbed about having to spend the morning with
the horses.&quot; Gabrielle smiled as she gave Xena a gentle push to the end
of the bed.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I get the picture.
You&#146;ve had your fill and now I&#146;m getting thrown out like an old used
bedroll.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no . . . let&#146;s
not get nasty,&quot; the smaller woman chortled. &quot;You want to stay in the
good graces of Your Queen now don&#146;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Queen, did you say,
My Queen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do believe I did.&quot;
Gabrielle attempted to look majestic, which was a little difficult seeing how
her only covering was a sheet.</p>
<p>&quot;You may be my Queen soon,
but today you are merely my bard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Merely? Since when is
a bard ever a &#145;merely&#146;? Dramatically, emphatically, poetically, but
never, never, merely a bard!&quot;</p>
<p>As was her gift, Gabrielle succeeded
in getting the staunch warrior to succumb to laughter. It was certainly a melodious
sound, and one, which in recent years infrequently fell on ears other than those
of her bard. In the time she&#146;d spent traveling with the freckle-faced woman-child,
Xena reclaimed much of the love and laughter that her damaged soul had previously
lost. This mere slip of a woman replenished the empty recesses of the warrior&#146;s
heart and filled it with a thirst for life without the turmoil of war.</p>
<p>It seemed that each time the
dark warrior gained a foothold on her humanity, some forgotten foe would rise,
and attempt to drag the champion back down into the dark pit she was slowly
climbing out of. Her last such encounter, only moons ago, was when they were
in the midst of saving Eve. Now, the warrior and her bard were being given a
short time of respite, allowing time for nurturing that part of herself she
always distanced in order to achieve victory over her enemies.</p>
<p>Only when she was with Gabrielle
could she feel truly whole, allow herself to laugh, love and weep when the spirit
moved her. Today she was feeling whole again, after spending an entire night
and then the morning with her beloved bard. But if the chalice were to be raised,
at least last night gave her the strength to again prepare to take on the world.</p>
<p>Coming out of her thoughts she
turned to gaze into emerald depths of love. She smiled inwardly, knowing if
she didn&#146;t leave soon, a repeat performance of last night and this morning&#146;s
love making would soon ensue. She cleared her throat, stood up, and walked toward
the edge of the ledge. &quot;I&#146;ll go down and see if I can find some way
to bring our clothes up without getting them soaked. It would be a lot easier
if we could travel through the forest and then only have the one way trip to
make back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me look around and
see if Aphrodite left us any clothes other than these night garments,&quot;
Gabrielle responded, dealing with her own thoughts of forgetting the entire
excursion for the moment and spending the remainder of the day in bed, wrapped
around her warrior.</p>
<p>She started opening drawers
in the dressers that stood next to the shelves. Tons of towels, nightshirts,
and negligees filled the drawers, but no leather, or armor. As she opened the
last drawer in one of the dressers she spotted a note written in the Goddess&#146;
own hand.</p>
<font FACE="Comic Sans MS">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, Little Bard, I know I gave
you no way to get up here other than a watery swim but . . .</p>
<i>
<p>Can&#146;t have a warrior running
around, sans armor and boots and leather. </p>
<p>Can&#146;t have her bard
in a birthday suit, running naked in all kinds of weather.</p>
<p>There&#146;s a platform
on the shore below, all shiny and gold and gleaming.</p>
<p>Place garments there you&#146;ll
want to wear, after swimming and climbing and &#145;dreaming&#146;. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</i>
<p>&quot;Look here&#146;s a small
key, a few actually, does she think we misplace things that easily,&quot; the
bard grinned as she picked up one of the gold keys. &quot;Well, that solves
the wet clothes situation.&quot; She handed Xena one of the keys. Guess you
have to swim with this in your mouth, or wear a shift and tie it onto that.
</p>
<p>&quot;The mouth will do fine,
thank you.&quot; Xena took the tiny key and started toward the ledge. &quot;I&#146;ll
help Eve catch some lunch if she hasn&#146;t already.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Great, I&#146;ll be down
in just a bit, I want to tidy up here first.&quot; She kissed the warrior and
watched as she dove off the ledge into the clear water below.</p>
<p>After watching Xena come up
for air, Gabrielle ran over to the archway between the cave and the forest.
Standing beyond the cave with the sunlight shining around her she called for
her friend.</p>
<p>&quot;Aphrodite, if you can
hear me please appear.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle waited for a few minutes
then repeated her request. When she received no answer she sulked back into
the cave and began making up the bed. Just as she was about to dive off into
the water to join Xena and Eve she heard a crackling sound behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;Aren&#146;t we the impatient
mortal today?&quot; The familiar voice echoed through the grotto. &quot;I came
as soon as I could, Little One. Is there a problem in paradise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not really,&quot; Gabrielle
smiled over at the Goddess of Love. &quot;Actually I wanted to thank you for
the lovely atmosphere you created for us to reacquaint with each other after
the horrific time we&#146;ve just been through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You called me back here
to thank me?&quot; The Goddess gave the mortal an unbelieving look.</p>
<p>&quot;Not exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought not. What is
it Gabrielle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really do appreciate
this special place and the ability to leave here and go anywhere we want. And
I totally realize that it would be impossible for us to get here without traveling
but . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could you hurry it up,
Little Bard? Cupid asked me to baby-sit and I&#146;m already running a little
behind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, I&#146;ll just blurt
it out. I was wondering if there was any way that we could put the horses .
. . one at a time mind you . . . on that platform down by the lake and whether
the grotto up here would hold their weight? You see that way we could take the
horses and anything we carried here with us back to wherever it was we were
going. Otherwise we would always have to be traveling by foot to get here. There
. . . that&#146;s the question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well that wasn&#146;t
so difficult now was it, Gabrielle? I guess I wasn&#146;t thinking about how
you mortals travel when I invented this love nest. Of course you can use the
platform for the horses; I&#146;ll make it so that it will enlarge to encompass
whatever it is you&#146;ve placed on it. Just remember to have only one horse
at a time on this ledge and take the first one into the woods before bringing
the second one up.&quot; She made a fluid motion with her hand and blinked her
eyes. &quot;There, all done and I moved it a little to accommodate the larger
loads. It&#146;s over by the tallest tree closest to the lake. It will recede
into the ground after you leave so you must remember the exact spot to find
the lock.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks again, Aphrodite.&quot;
</p>
<p>&quot;No problem, my pleasure.
Speaking of pleasure . . . how did it go last night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was marvelous. We got
to know each other all over again and in such comfort.&quot; The small blonde
began blushing.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#146;s what love
is all about.&quot; As she started to leave, Gabrielle stopped her once again.</p>
<p>&quot;Aphrodite, before you
go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quickly, Gabrielle, remember
I&#146;m in a bit of a hurry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#146;s about Ares.&quot;</p>
<p>A frown of confusion crept over
the usually smiling face of the Goddess, &quot;What about Ares? He hasn&#146;t
bothered any of you has he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Now it was Gabrielle&#146;s
turn to look confused. &quot;How could he have bothered us? I was just wondering
how he was getting along, being a mortal and all? I feel somewhat responsible
for his lot in life these days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, is that all.&quot;
A smile returned to the Goddess&#146; face as she giggled. &quot;Ares is quite
fine and he&#146;s been restored to both immortal and God. I made him promise
that if I went and got him some ambrosia that he would never bother any of you
again, unless you specifically asked for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#146;s wonderful
Aphrodite,&quot; the small bard remarked. &quot;I feel so much better after
hearing that. He spent a difficult time down here when his sword was stolen
a while back and he lost his Godhood, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that&#146;s why I
took pity on him. That and the fact that Eros kept whining that his father couldn&#146;t
be left on earth as a mortal. He is family, after all.&quot; She smiled at her
mortal friend as she disappeared in a puff of gold and pink. &quot;Chow, Gabrielle
. . . don&#146;t do anything I wouldn&#146;t do.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle shook her head laughing
at the Goddess&#146; final comment. Her heart felt immeasurably lighter knowing
that the God of War had been given back his birthright. No matter how much they
disagreed over the years, if it hadn&#146;t been for Aphrodite, who took them
up to Olympus, and Ares, who gave up his Godhood, she and Eve would both be
dead.</p>
<p>As much as she hated to think
about it, Ares had taken Xena under his wing long before she ever met the woman.
No matter how much she may have resented that, his involvement in her warrior&#146;s
life may have been the only reason Xena was still alive for her to meet on that
fateful day. If it hadn&#146;t been for his intervention, she may not have possessed
the fortitude to make it through the years following Cortese&#146;s siege on
Amphipolis.</p>
<p>Thinking about Ares always made
her nervous. Somewhere deep in her unconscious thoughts she held the fear that
he might someday win her lover back, but not as long as she was still around.
</p>
<p>Shaking off the thoughts of
the past, it was time to join the rest of her little family on the shore of
the lake. Her stomach was beginning to think she was never going to feed it
and she wanted to tell Xena the good news about not having to travel by foot
back from wherever it was the stash was hidden. She took off the nightshirt
she had donned before calling on Aphrodite and laid it on the bed.</p>
<p>Going to the edge of the ledge
she looked over the calm water to spot Xena and Eve standing on the shoreline
talking. After looking straight down into the lake from the ledge, she felt
her stomach begin to churn; if she had eaten breakfast it would have been on
its way to the water. <i>By the Gods! I didn&#146;t think we were this far up.
I&#146;m not That good a diver. I guess I could jump off. </i></p>
<p>The dive had been like second
nature to Xena. Sometimes Gabrielle swore the warrior was part fish and was
hiding gills somewhere, although she of all people knew better. Gabrielle was
more of a landlubber and even looking directly down at the lake was making her
nauseous. She continued to look back over to the shoreline and back down into
the water, three &#150; many four times &#150; trying to get the nerve to jump
. . . all of a sudden an idea came to her. She walked over to the bed and grabbed
the nightshirt, throwing it over her head she ran in the direction of the forest.
<i>No time like the present to initiate the forest. </i>Walking into the sunlight
she closed her eyes and imagined herself standing next to Xena on the edge of
the lake below.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Xena jumped
back startled. &quot;The least you could do is herald your arrival the next
time, you know, you could have yelled over that you were going to pop in instead
of swim over.</p>
<p>Gabrielle grabbed her dark hero
around the waist. &quot;That was fantastic! All I did was close my eyes and
imagine myself here, and here I am!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah we can see. Why didn&#146;t
you swim over?&quot;</p>
<p>Hanging her head slightly and
mumbling she responded, &quot;I was afraid to dive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you say, Gabrielle?&quot;
Xena prompted, having heard the confession she thought it amusing to have the
small blonde repeat it.</p>
<p>&quot;I said, I was afraid to
dive &#150; it looked too far down. There! Happy?&quot; Emerald green eyes squinted,
throwing a stern look in the direction of the raven-haired beauty. &quot;Besides
I wanted to try out the new toy. Come to think of it, my warrior, for teasing
me . . . maybe I won&#146;t tell you the good news.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What good news?&quot;
Xena asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I said I shouldn&#146;t
tell you.&quot; Gabrielle insisted.</p>
<p>&quot;Then tell me,&quot; Eve
spoke up. &quot;I&#146;m an innocent bystander. You can tell me the good news.&quot;
She glanced back and forth between the two women standing in front of her. &quot;If
it&#146;s really good news, someone ought to know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I already do know.&quot;
Gabrielle smiled and began to walk over toward the fire. &quot;Are we going
to eat soon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most definitely, Gabrielle.&quot;
Xena walked over and stood next to her, casually draping one strong arm over
the smaller woman&#146;s shoulders. &quot;We&#146;re going to eat as soon as
you tell me the good news.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since you put it that
way,&quot; the fair-haired woman gave in. &quot;I guess I&#146;d better tell
you. Remember how we were discussing how the forest was fantastic but that we
would have to come here on foot because if we didn&#146;t we&#146;d have to
leave the horses behind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just finished talking
to our favorite Goddess and between the two of us we worked out a better arrangement.&quot;
Gabrielle beamed from ear to ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah . . . between the two
of you, huh?&quot; Sapphire eyes looked questioningly over at the imaginative
bard. </p>
<p>&quot;More like . . . I asked
and . . . she complied.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle you are stretching
this out into a boring conversation and the longer you take the longer it will
be before you eat.&quot; Xena shook her head and pointed to the pan full of
uncooked fish. &quot;I, for one, am getting extremely hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay . . . okay . . .
Aphrodite agreed to make the platform work for just about anything we put on
it. But, if we use it for the horses, it has to be one at a time because when
they get to the ledge, it may not be sturdy enough for both horses and all of
us. There &#150; isn&#146;t that great? That means we can eat a leisurely lunch,
pack up everything and everybody, go get the stash, and come back here tonight.
Tomorrow we can leave after a good night&#146;s sleep and be at the village
in an instant. By the Gods I&#146;m almost too excited to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now that&#146;s going
a little far, Auntie Gabrielle, even I don&#146;t believe that last statement.&quot;
Eve laughed, while picking up the fish pan and handing it to the bard. &quot;What
to you say we cook these little critters?&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle took the pan and placed
it over the fire. Xena sat by the edge of the lake cleaning her sword and Eve
went and picked some more of the berries she found the day before.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you fill the water
bags, Xena?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; She continued
her polishing.</p>
<p>&quot;I see Eve tied the horses
back up; have they been fed and watered?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you find the platform,
so we know where to put the key?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle you really hate
it when I&#146;m sitting around just cleaning my sword, don&#146;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>Stumbling for words the bard
flipped the fish over in the pan. &quot;No. I was just wondering if everything
was taken care of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, huh. You just wondered
why I get to sit over here doing nothing while you get to stand over there and
cook the fish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#146;s not it at
all.&quot; Gabrielle remarked becoming slightly irritated. &quot;I wanted to
make sure we would be ready to leave after brunch is finished.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What in Tartarus is a
b-r-u-n-c-h?&quot; Xena asked standing and walking over to the fireside.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we kind of missed
breakfast because . . . um . . . you know why we missed breakfast. And now it&#146;s
actually time for lunch but it&#146;s kind of a combination of the two meals
so brunch sounded like a good thing to call it.&quot;</p>
<p>Smiling down at her lover, Xena
stuck two fingers into the pan and pulled out a piece of the fillet. &quot;Brunch
it is then . . . yum . . . good brunch.&quot; Leaning over she kissed Gabrielle
gently on the cheek. &quot;And yes, I most certainly remember why we missed
breakfast, and would do it again in a heartbeat.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle stretched and kissed
her lover on the cheek. &quot;Ditto,&quot; she replied smiling, then placed
the pan on a nearby rock and walked over in the direction of the saddlebags.
&quot;I think I still have some bread left from the other day.&quot; Pulling
a half loaf out of the bag, she started back toward the fire. &quot;This ought
to go nicely with the fish and berries. I can&#146;t wait to get to the village;
it&#146;ll be good to have a complete meal again, with bread we don&#146;t have
to dunk to soften enough to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>Xena seemed a little distant.
Gabrielle&#146;s eyes took on a pensive look, &quot;Are you looking forward
to staying with the Amazons, Xena?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems the best thing
to do right now, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But are you looking forward
to it? Any time we are in either this village or the other one where we have
permanent huts, you begin to get agitated after a few days. Are you going to
be comfortable living with the sisters for a while?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As long as I&#146;m not
made to feel useless. Sometimes it&#146;s a difficult to deal with all the attention
showered upon you when we hit the villages.&quot; There she said it out loud.
Gabrielle wasn&#146;t stupid and they were planning an extensive stay. It was
best she got her trepidations out in the open before they arrived.</p>
<p>Gabrielle put the fish down
one of the warm rocks sitting beside the fire and put her arms around her champion.</p>
<p>&quot;You could never be useless,
Xena. I know our relationship takes on a different tone when we&#146;re surrounded
by the Amazons but once you&#146;re my Consort you will have a rightful place
in the village, second only to mine.&quot; She watched the sapphire eyes as
emotions danced across them; emotions not belied by the stone look on her lover&#146;s
face.</p>
<p>&quot;Xena, if there are problems
we need to settle them now, before we enter Amazon territory. If you don&#146;t
want to go then we&#146;ll change plans and do something else. Are you having
second thoughts . . . &quot; she almost feared to ask the question &quot; .
. . about getting married.&quot;</p>
<p>Xena looked around to see if
Eve was within hearing distance before answering. &quot;Of course not, I meant
every word I said last night. But I do think we need to explain things to Eve
first. She seems to be fine with our relationship but I would feel better if
we had a . . . well . . . a family discussion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds like a wonderful
idea. Why don&#146;t we talk about it on the way back from wherever it is we
are going this afternoon? By the way, where are we going?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are some ruins between
Mystatrada and Armoupolis. Around the ruins is a forest and some caves. That&#146;s
where we&#146;re heading. It should only take us about five candlemarks to get
back from there, so if we&#146;re lucky we&#146;ll be back by a little after
dusk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#146;t we leave
most of the campsite set so Eve doesn&#146;t have much to do. I don&#146;t think
there will be any travelers coming this way, do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, probably not. Keeping
the campsite up would be a good idea and give us less to pack around with us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anything you don&#146;t
want to leave out in the open we can hide or take up to the ledge.&quot; Gabrielle
volunteered.</p>
<p>When Eve came back to the fireside
she was carrying a pouch full of berries and some fruit she found on a tree
a little farther to the west. </p>
<p>Taking the fruit from her daughter
Xena examined them. &quot;These are similar to figs in texture and taste, I
forgot they grew up here. You&#146;re a good gatherer for a city girl,&quot;
she smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;I practiced some when
I took the army out.&quot; Eve admitted and then quickly changed the subject.
&quot;I see the main course is ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Gabrielle
answered, &quot;we&#146;ve been waiting for you. Sit down; I&#146;m starving.&quot;</p>
<p>During lunch they discussed
the plan for the afternoon and evening. Xena had already told Eve about the
ledge and the enchanted woods. Eve started picking at her food and was sitting
across from Gabrielle with a melancholy look on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#146;s the matter,
Eve?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#146;t know why
but I was wondering how Ares was doing. I can&#146;t imagine being a God without
powers or immortality . . . I mean it&#146;s hard to conceive of Ares as a mortal.
He was a bastard but he must really love Mother or he wouldn&#146;t have given
up his Godhood to save us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was thinking those exact
things this morning, Eve, minus the part about loving your mother. When I spoke
to Aphrodite, I asked her how he was doing. You might be happy to know that
she gave him some ambrosia and restored both his immortality and his Godhood.&quot;
She took the plate from the younger woman&#146;s hand and piled it with the
others.</p>
<p>&quot;That makes me feel better.
Now I can go back to hating all the shit he pulled on me again. I was feeling
guilty after he sacrificed like that.&quot; She smiled over at Gabrielle. &quot;I&#146;ll
bet you know what I mean, don&#146;t you? He was always getting in the way between
you and Mother. Now that he&#146;s a God again, you might start having those
same old problems.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#146;t think so,&quot;
Gabrielle replied picking up all the utensils and walking over to the lake.
</p>
<p>Up to this point Xena had been
silently listening to the banter being carried on between her two favorite women.
Her heart lightened at the words Gabrielle repeated about Ares having been given
back all that was his to begin with. As much of a problem as he had occasionally
been, it was an enormous sacrifice he made, one which more than proved his love
for her. In the dark part of her heart she knew beyond a doubt that had it not
been for the God of War she might never have lived long enough to have found
Gabrielle and for that, he would always hold a special place in her heart. She
thought back to when they imbibed Celesta&#146;s tears &#150; had Ares not taken
them both to the high country, Gabrielle would have aged the same as Joxer did.
As much of a bastard as he could be, he knew how much she loved Gabrielle and
in return he showed his love by placing her lover&#146;s body beside her in
the icy tomb. It was hard to harbor ill feelings about him any longer. When
she thought deeper about it she wondered how he, or Aphrodite for that matter,
could have even thought about helping Gabrielle, Eve, or her. Especially after
she killed Deimos. She got up and went to stand beside Gabrielle. </p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean you don&#146;t
think so?&quot;</p>
<p>Without looking up from her
chore Gabrielle answered. &quot;Aphrodite told me she made Ares promise before
she gave him the ambrosia that he would not interfere with our lives ever again
. . . unless we called for him.&quot; She looked up into the deep blue eyes
of her lover. The expression on her warrior&#146;s face was difficult to read.
Emotions were playing gently across the eyes of the dark-haired beauty, the
depth of which Gabrielle was having a hard time reading. Her stomach started
to tighten as she realized that perhaps the faraway look in the cerulean eyes
could only be one of sorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you thinking,
Xena?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; The warrior
turned back toward the fire.</p>
<p>Gabrielle grabbed her hand,
stopping her from leaving. &quot;Nothing is not what&#146;s on your mind. What
is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I was just thinking
about the last time we saw him. He looked so . . . so vulnerable.&quot;</p>
<p>Now she got right up into her
warrior&#146;s face, her own flushing slightly. It was okay for Her to think
kindly of Ares, but for Xena, well that put a different feeling into her heart,
a different twist into the situation. &quot;Listen Xena, I know none of us could
ever thank him enough for the sacrifice he made. But all the crap he put us
through &#150; you&#146;ve got to remember that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do.&quot; The tall warrior
almost whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;For the God&#146;s sake,
Xena . . . He killed Eli . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was Eli&#146;s destiny,
Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He enabled your dark side
to grow . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It may very well have
saved my life.&quot;</p>
<p>For every counter Gabrielle
came up with, Xena returned a viable response. There was a hard lump growing
in the small bard&#146;s throat.</p>
<p>Eve quietly watched and listened
from the area of the campsite, trying to busy herself with small chores.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you trying to tell
me that you Want him back in our lives?&quot; Her emerald eyes showed mixed
signs of anger, fear, and sorrow as unbidden tears began to well up and spill
over.</p>
<p>Xena drew her close and held
her tightly. &quot;No, my love . . . &quot; She looked over at Eve and the younger
woman got up and walked back into the woods. &quot;Gabrielle . . . look at me
. . .&quot; Placing a hand gently under her bard&#146;s face she tenderly lifted
it up, kissing away the moist droplets as she tried to explain the mass of mixed
emotions that were playing in her mind while Gabrielle was talking to Eve.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#146;s just that he&#146;s
been a part of my life since before I met you Gabrielle and I suppose a small
fraction of my being misses the challenge he always provided. I know he was
nothing but a thorn in your side and I&#146;m sorry for that. But, you must
realize that part of me will miss the danger he always provided.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the anger overtook all other
emotions as Gabrielle pulled away from Xena and started back toward the lake.
</p>
<p>Without thinking, the warrior
grabbed the smaller woman roughly and spun her around. &quot;What in Tartarus
is wrong with you?&quot;</p>
<p>Green daggers shot up at her
as venomous words spewed from Gabrielle mouth. &quot;If you want your damned
God of War back Xena all you have to do is talk to him. I&#146;m sure he&#146;ll
come running, and we can start our little m»nage ∑ trois all over again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For the love of Zeus.&quot;
The reference to the demised god flew out of the warrior&#146;s mouth before
she had a chance to think. Gabrielle&#146;s statement hit her as comical. &quot;A
m»nage ∑ trois? You can&#146;t be serious Gabrielle!&quot; Xena didn&#146;t
know whether to laugh or be angry.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn it Xena he tried
to seduce you every chance he got and it came damn close to happening back in
Amphipolis not too very long ago . . . uh . . . by our recollections that is
. . . not by everyone else&#146;s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#146;s get this little
problem settled once and for all so we don&#146;t Ever have to have this discussion
again. Do you think I would have asked you to marry me if I had any feelings,
whatsoever for Ares?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#146;t know. Remember
when you said <i>&#145;I felt something,&#146; </i>when we were in Amphipolis
. . . Remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to yourself! Gabrielle,
I was kidding! He kept me on my toes, kept my skills honed and my mind agile.
I had to think on my feet whenever he was around. But I have no desire for him
. . . not in the way you are thinking. None whatsoever, believe me Gabrielle.
The only person I want in that respect is you.&quot; She pulled her lover close,
running a strong hand down the skin of Gabrielle&#146;s back. An almost wicked
smile graced her face as she felt the small bumps involuntarily appear on her
lover&#146;s skin. Bending over she whispered softly into a small ear, before
trailing her touch all the way around the outside of it. &quot;I love you more
than life; just looking at you starts me . . . &quot; Taking one small hand
in her own she positioned her lover&#146;s fingers beneath her undergarments,
entreating the blonde to feel the already abundant moistness. </p>
<p>As a moan escaped Gabrielle&#146;s
lips, Xena covered the smaller woman&#146;s mouth with her own, her tongue unashamedly
begging entrance into the sweet dark cave. </p>
<p>&quot;No one, no one in the
world but you for this my love,&quot; she pressed her hand hard against her
lover&#146;s, and Gabrielle felt her tense and release. &quot;You have my solemn
oath, Gabrielle, you are my Destiny.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Xena!&quot; Gabrielle
broke away abruptly. &quot;We&#146;ll be taking a week&#146;s vacation if you
keep that up. What if Eve came back into camp?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#146;s a smart girl,
Gabrielle, she&#146;d turn around and leave.&quot; The warrior smiled, almost
sheepishly. &quot;Guess we should wait until this evening to finish, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess,&quot; the small
blonde smiled back. &quot;You surely know how to make me want a cold dip in
the lake,&quot; Gabrielle countered as she walked over to the shoreline and
placed her feet into he cool water. &quot;That should take me down a degree
or two.&quot; Smiling back at the love of her life she picked up the dishes
she left scattered on the fine dirt by the water&#146;s edge.</p>
<p>&quot;So, is the conversation
ended? Is the matter settled?&quot; Xena arched an eyebrow as she watched her
mate clean up.</p>
<p>&quot;Consider the topic closed,&quot;
<i>At least for the time being, never can tell with you, my champion. </i>She
continued washing and began humming to herself.</p>
<p>By the time Eve returned the
campsite had been put into order and there was a small mound of things that
needed to be left in the safer ledge area. It was decided that Gabrielle would
go first followed by the supplies. Next they would send Argo, then Eve, the
other horse, and finally Xena bringing up the rear.<i> </i>The entire procedure
proceeded smoothly and within a candlemark they were all standing in the warm
sunlight of the enchanted woods.</p>
<p>&quot;Aphrodite must think highly
of you Gabrielle to have given you such a unique retreat and the ability to
travel like a Goddess,&quot; Eve stated after having thoroughly examined the
cave and the adjacent forest.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#146;t go giving her
a bigger head than she already has now, Eve.&quot; Xena warned and quickly received
a swift swat on the butt. </p>
<p>Observing the swat, Eve gave
Xena a raised eyebrow &#150; a look Xena herself had honed to perfection in
the mirror when she was just a teenager. Xena returned the look with one of
her own, followed by a whispered, &quot;Only from Gabrielle, Eve. Remember that
. . . only Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>The younger woman chuckled to
herself and stepped closer to Argo in anticipation of the trip they would soon
all be taking.</p>
<p>&quot;All right now, is everyone
ready to go?&quot; Gabrielle asked. After receiving an affirmative she explained
for Eve&#146;s sake what was going to happen next. &quot;You see, we all stand
in close proximity of each other, here in this clearing. Then either Xena or
I think of where we want to be and zap,&quot; she snapped her fingers, &quot;and
presto, we&#146;re there. It&#146;s that simple.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#146;m ready when you
two are,&quot; the younger woman stated.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Gabrielle
faced Xena. &quot;Since you know where this place is, I would assume we should
go on your thoughts,&quot; she smiled warmly into her lover&#146;s face.</p>
<p>The next thing they knew they
were in a much darker woods with a canopy of leafless tree branches obscuring
the sun and a residue of mist almost knee deep. </p>
<p>&quot;Does this look like the
place, Xena?&quot; Gabrielle questioned as a chill ran the length of her body.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure does . . . &quot;
Xena replied looking around cautiously. &quot;It hasn&#146;t changed a bit.
You cold?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A little.&quot; Gabrielle
answered, shivering at the inclement weather. </p>
<p>&quot;Here let me get you something
for your shoulders, I figured it might be like this. Are you okay, Eve?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, I&#146;m fine, thanks
anyway.&quot; The younger woman looked around the dreary clearing.</p>
<p>&quot;By the Gods it&#146;s
gloomy here, Xena.&quot; Gabrielle commented. </p>
<p>&quot;That&#146;s one of the
reasons I chose this place, it never gets any better. I guess it used to match
my attitude toward life.&quot; Meandering toward the north she cut down brush
as it got in her way. &quot;If I remember correctly there should be a cave over
here.&quot; Pointing ahead, she moved forward with Eve and Gabrielle following.</p>
<p>She stopped and turned to face
her companions. &quot;Let&#146;s tie the horses up here. They can&#146;t go
any further and if they&#146;re left to their own devices they might not be
around when we get back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds promising,&quot;
Gabrielle replied sarcastically.</p>
<p>Even the ground beneath their
feet was infested with a dreadful, uneasy feeling; the earth lacked its natural
bounce and life. Every footfall left a lasting impression, and even the grass
refused to spring back once the traveler&#146;s moved on. Silence screamed out
to the trio; not a single woodland animal could be heard. It was as though the
entire area was dead.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope we don&#146;t have
to be here very long Xena, this place gives me the creeps.&quot; Gabrielle edged
closer to her hero.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no. We won&#146;t
be long, it&#146;s right around the . . . there it is.&quot; She pointed to
a cave in the mountain that resembled a gaping wound. The sides were covered
with a brownish/green moss, dripping from the top of the opening was more of
the same, combined with vines that intertwined so intricately that the entrance
was barely large enough for them to walk through. </p>
<p>&quot;I hope you brought something
to torch, Mother. I don&#146;t know about Auntie Gabrielle, but I don&#146;t
want to go into that hole without some sort of light.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, we&#146;ve something
to light.&quot; With that she began to cut away at some of the overhanging vegetation.
The vines wriggled in her hands almost as if they were the only living stuff
in all of the forest. Inside the mouth and slightly to the left she picked up
the remnants of a torch. Rolling it on the floor some dark, sticky substance
stuck to the ancient utensil. Xena turned around to spot Eve and Gabrielle standing
by the portal, neither of them attempting to enter.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, nothing&#146;s
going to get you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#146;s what you say.&quot;
Gabrielle mumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. That&#146;s what
I say.&quot; With that she struck the torch on the cave wall; it sparked then
burst into flame. &quot;Here, there are enough of these for all of us.&quot;
The warrior handed the first torch over to Eve as she prepared another for Gabrielle
and then one for herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice places you used to
frequent, Xena.&quot; Gabrielle tried to make light of the uneasy feeling surrounding
the area.</p>
<p>&quot;This was one of the best,&quot;
the dark champion grinned, raising an arched eyebrow. &quot;It gets better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, gee, I can&#146;t
wait!&quot; When Gabrielle saw Xena reaching back to the hilt of her sword she
readied herself by reaching for one of the sais, the other hand holding tightly
onto the glowing torch. Glancing back she noticed that Eve wasn&#146;t waiting
for something to jump out at her; her sword was already unsheathed. &quot;Aren&#146;t
we a jittery little group who&#146;ve come to play among the dead? Xena what
is this place?&quot;</p>
<p>Without looking back and without
a word, Xena followed the path to the right, then the left, then left again.
They came to a circular section where it looked like there might have been an
ancient altar. Stopping she turned and faced her companions.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#146;t seem to recall
the historic name for this place but we used to call it the Cave of Living Death.
Half of my men, brave as they were in battle, paled whenever I spoke of coming
here. The legend states that it is a forsaken parcel of earth, where evil souls
unable to find their way to Tartarus reside for eternity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew it had something
to do with the dead &#150; I could feel it.&quot; Gabrielle said trembling.</p>
<p>&quot;Gods, Mother. Why did
you ever come here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What better place to hid
a treasure than an area where no one alive dares come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one but you! Why are
we stopping here?&quot; Gabrielle shuttered at the density of the air in the
middle of the cave. Even with the three torches, it seemed as though the darkness
continued to swallow every inch of light it could. </p>
<p>&quot;Do you see these altars?&quot;
Xena pointed to the six podiums surrounding a large black obelisk in the middle
of the room. I have to remember in what order to . . .&quot; She walked over
to the one situated west of the obelisk and turned it totally around to the
right once, then walked to the one diagonal to that one and turned it completely
around to the left. Lastly she approached the obelisk, bent down and turned
the base of it two and a-half-times to the right. She stepped back and turned
facing the north wall.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on we only have a
few minutes to get inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the Gods, Xena, inside
what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be very quiet Gabrielle
&#150; don&#146;t talk until I tell you to, just follow in my footsteps and
hurry. Unless the two of you would rather wait for me out here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a Cyclops&#146; eye,&quot;
Gabrielle announced as she grabbed Eve&#146;s arm. &quot;No one stays out here
alone.&quot;</p>
<p>An eerie sound akin to the opening
of an archaic sarcophagus cut through the air. Gabrielle inched close enough
to touch Xena with Eve, in turn, touching her. An opening appeared where no
trace of one had been before and Xena stepped through, reaching a hand behind
to grab on to her bard, who in turn, grabbed on to Eve. </p>
<p>If it was at all possible the
air became even stiller, staler, and colder. Emerald eyes widened as the bard
took in the display of figures and symbols artistically written on the walls.
Xena was traveling almost too fast for the shorter woman&#146;s strides to keep
up her, but with a little extra push from fear, Gabrielle did her damnedest.</p>
<p>Not a sound was uttered, as
Xena advised, and within the length of 15 horses there appeared another blocked
archway.</p>
<p>Xena turned to her companions
and put her fingers up to her lips, reminding them not to speak. Approaching
the archway she put her hands flat on either side of it and simultaneously turned
them away from her body. The blockage disappeared and she ushered the two women
into a room. The room was brilliantly lit from some unknown source. When everyone
was inside she turned back from whence they came and did the same thing on this
side of the archway, immediately closing them in.</p>
<p>&quot;That was very good, ladies.
I&#146;m glad you didn&#146;t make any sounds while we were in the corridor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you like to explain
to me why?&quot; the bard inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit down, it&#146;s quite
a story. The corridor we just came through is the Hall of the Searching Dead.
They made it through the forest and into the cave. They even made it past the
altars, but there they got stuck. You see these are the dead, who even Hades
doesn&#146;t want; they would make Tartarus look like the Elysian Fields if
they all arrived to spend eternity. Greed called them to this once thriving
region. Greek fire, precious gems, natural springs with healing waters, and
sacred oil for burning were all in abundance. But after the reign of terror
these subhumans wrecked upon the land and its inhabitants, nothing was left
but the stench of decay. </p>
<p>&quot;Hercules had gone some
time before and spoke to some of the Druids about this place, just about the
time the rot from this area was beginning to infiltrate and sicken the land
surrounding it. The entire countryside was being taken over by warlords, thieves,
and all other forms of low-life human monsters. The forest was already dead
and parcel by parcel the surrounding land was beginning to die as well. Because
of their high regard for nature, one of the high Druidesses agreed to come and
help the people of this region, but even more, she wanted to help Mother Earth
to reclaim that which was stolen from Her, and to punish the violators.</p>
<p>&quot;She sent a rumor before
her that she would be carrying with her the cauldron of Dagda which possessed
the power to not only give sustenance to anyone who drank from it, but also
the power of rejuvenation. This was done in the hope that the marauders would
hear of the cauldron and be on the lookout for it. This forest and cave were
selected as the Druid&#146;s new home. She knew that neither the forest nor
the cave would ever recover, but if her plan worked, the rest of the area would.
</p>
<p>&quot;As it so happened she
was right and it wasn&#146;t but a few days after she set up the altars that
the human vermin started arriving, wanting to drink from the cauldron. Under
the guise of being afraid, she gave them their wish. But instead of getting
rejuvenation, they received a potion, which, similar to Celesta&#146;s tears,
gave the illusion of death. </p>
<p>&quot;Now, the Druids believe
that the head is the seat of the soul and so when the despoilers fell victim
to the portion, an apprentice would lop off their head and make a niche for
it along the bottom of the corridor. The symbols upon the walls are runes and
they compel the dead to stay forever &#150; trapped between the two archways
flanked with skulls.&quot;</p>
<p>Eve looked puzzled, &quot;Why
didn&#146;t we see the skulls? I didn&#146;t see them on the archway or in the
corridor?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because your attention
was not drawn to them. The ones on the archways are deeply embedded and time
has made them almost invisible. The ones in the hallway are on the very bottom
and I didn&#146;t think it was necessary for you to know about them before we
traveled through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Xena, that doesn&#146;t
explain why we needed to be silent?&quot; Gabrielle interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#146;s just a superstition,
but one that I am loath to put to the test. It is said that if so much as a
word is uttered, the spells will break and the souls will be set free. If one
of the archways is open at that time . . . well, I don&#146;t even want to think
about that.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at the somber faces
of the two women she loved and wondered why in Tartarus she ever agreed to bring
them along with her on this trek. Then shrugging her shoulders she opened the
door leading into the treasure trove. </p>
<p>Gabrielle gasped when her eyes
caught sight of the small mountain of spoils, which covered over half of the
room.</p>
<p>Eve looked at her mother with
a new admiration and Xena frowned at the emotion that the expression evoked.</p>
<p>&quot;By the Gods Xena.&quot;
Gabrielle stood with her mouth hanging open.</p>
<p>&quot;No . . .&quot; Xena corrected.
&quot;By the Warlords, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>They stepped into the room and
over to the treasure. Gabrielle and Eve each took out a small sack and began
filling them with dinars, gold and silver coins, precious gems, and jewelry.
Xena brought a large bag to hold the goblets she intended to take back as well
as some of the gold and silver trays. The amount that fit into the bags was
minimal compared to what was left.</p>
<p>&quot;We could live on this
one stash for the rest of our lives and never have to lift a finger to make
a living &#150; do you realize that?&quot; Gabrielle looked over at her lover
who was staring at her with a broad smile across her face. Her sapphire eyes
were twinkling, putting the many faceted jewels lying all around the room to
shame.</p>
<p>&quot;But Gabrielle this is
loot from war, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A war whose victims have
long since been sent to peace. And as you so informed me earlier, these are
treasures taken from Warlords who have also seen the face of Hades . . . or
the cold depths of the corridor outside these walls.&quot; Gabrielle chilled
to think about walking back through that hallway knowing what she now knew.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#146;re awfully quiet,
Eve.&quot; Xena looked over at her daughter who was standing with her bag, looking
at the hoard at her feet. </p>
<p>&quot;Rummaging through this
I recognized a lot of royal emblems on trays and goblets. I guess it took me
back. Sometimes it&#146;s hard when I remember; a lot of the memories still
hurt. There is a &#133; feeling when I think of Rome. I was treated honorably
and I can&#146;t fault Caesar for that, Mother. I think he honestly did what
he thought was best for me, to keep me safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think you&#146;re right
Eve. Caesar loved you and kept you out of harm&#146;s way and for that I will
always be grateful to him. You&#146;re an unusually quiet young woman, Eve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She takes after her mother,&quot;
Gabrielle added.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess she does.&quot;
Xena smiled at her lover and then at her daughter. Putting the sack over her
shoulder she re-instructed the two women not to utter a word as they passed
through the Hall of the Searching Dead.</p>
<p>Doing everything in reverse
that she had done to get to the treasure room, Xena led them back into the corridor.
</p>
<p>They were almost through the
dreaded hallway, when suddenly Gabrielle tripped on something. She later swore
that something grabbed at her. She caught herself with her hands as she fell
towards the floor. Her torch illuminated the rows of heads, mortared tightly
into the wall. Caught off guard, she involuntarily she began to let out a scream.
Just as the sound began issuing forth from her mouth a large, strong hand covered
her lips. Shaking her head and saying not a word, Xena proceeded to pick Gabrielle
up. Handing the extra torch to Eve, she motioned to the young woman to precede
her through the now opened archway.</p>
<p>Standing outside the gloomy
cave, the three women just looked at each other. Xena carefully put Gabrielle
down and asked if she&#146;d hurt anything in the near fall.</p>
<p>&quot;No, and I&#146;m so sorry
Xena.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#146;t worry about
it, it didn&#146;t happen &#150; so there&#146;s nothing to be sorry for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it was very close
to happening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle close only counts
in horse shoes and Chinese black powder.&quot; She grinned at her bard and kissed
her tenderly on the top of her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Can we get out of this
place, you two? I really don&#146;t need depressing and this certainly is.&quot;
Eve untied the horses and handed one set of reins to Gabrielle, the other to
her mother.</p>
<p>As anticipated, traveling back
to the lake took about five candlemarks. Along the way Gabrielle brought out
a quick dinner of dried rabbit jerky, the last of the bread, and some berries
they found along the path. It was filling enough, and they didn&#146;t have
to stop to consume it. Because they weren&#146;t pushing the horses very hard,
Eve rode part of the time behind Gabrielle and part behind Xena. They talked
about getting her a horse of her own when they reached the Amazon Village.</p>
<p>Discussions also centered about
relationships and the difference between what Eve might have grown up with and
the reality of living in an Amazon village. Eve smiled knowingly when the conversation
was first breached. Gabrielle didn&#146;t let Xena cough and sputter for too
long before taking over the reins of the sensitive chat. After letting her two
&quot;mothers&quot; choose and pick their words carefully, she finally let them
off the proverbial hook.</p>
<p>&quot;By Caesar, <i>damn I need
to stop letting that one slip,</i> I was raised in Rome! Don&#146;t you think
we all know what goes on in the bath houses?&quot; She squeezed Xena tightly
as she road behind her on Argo. Looking at the back of her mother&#146;s head,
she noticed that the tips of Xena&#146;s ears had just turned pink. </p>
<p>&quot;Pink is your color.&quot;
She giggled and received an elbow in the gut for the untoward statement. </p>
<p>&quot;Listen, all I&#146;m saying
is that you two don&#146;t need to tiptoe around me with anything that&#146;s
going on, or in the environment that I&#146;ll run up against in the Amazon
village. To tell you the truth I&#146;ve about had my fill of conniving, sniveling
bastards that only want their way with you to bolster their own egos or to better
their position in life, Caesar and Ares included. Even though I can forgive
Ares because of his final sacrifice, if I stop and really think about it . .
. it wasn&#146;t done for my sake . . . it was done for yours, Mother.&quot;
Again she squeezed Xena&#146;s waist.</p>
<p>&quot;Eve we don&#146;t want
you to feel threatened or coerced into anything, you do understand that don&#146;t
you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Auntie Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason for going
to the Village is to heal and to be at a place where we don&#146;t have to keep
looking over our shoulders for a while for the trouble that is following us.
The sisters will take that load from our shoulders.&quot; Gabrielle looked over
at Eve with the loving eyes of a mother who wants nothing but to protect. &quot;Eve
once you&#146;ve figured out what you want and where you want to go, at least
you&#146;ll have made bonds with your sister Amazons. At that point you&#146;ll
be able to leave the village or make it your home.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;And you and Mother? What
are your plans?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I . . . we . . . we&#146;re
really not sure at this juncture,&quot; Gabrielle stammered, looking to her
champion to jump in and help her out. &quot;Most of the Amazons we knew have
probably crossed over by now, but I&#146;m still the reigning Queen according
to Amazon law.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mother, in what capacity
are you part of the tribe?&quot;</p>
<p>Xena shot a glance over at Gabrielle
who merely snickered. Xena raised an eyebrow in search of help, but the blonde
simply shook her head and put the question back on the dark warrior.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Eve . . . I&#146;ve
actually been a part of the tribe since even before I met Gabrielle but that
is another story. Even though I&#146;ve never been through any of the Amazonian
rituals to become a member, they&#146;ve always treated me as family. I have
simply never committed myself before.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Before?&quot;</p>
<p>Again the knowing smile from
Gabrielle and a tilt of her head that let her lover know that she would finish
the conversation that Xena just fumbled.</p>
<p>&quot;Eve,&quot; Gabrielle began,
&quot;one of the major events this trip to the village will be our joining.
Your mother will finally become an Amazon in every sense of the word and she
will be part of the tribe. Xena asked me to marry her the other night and we
plan on having the ceremony in the village. She will then be known as the Queen&#146;s
Consort, making all three of us tribal members.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slow learner, huh, Mother?
I would say it&#146;s about time.&quot; The younger woman cleared her throat
as her voice took on a more serious tone. &quot;I&#146;ve been doing a lot of
soul searching since we started this quest back to the tribe. I tried to think
of the kind of person I would be today, if I had been raised by both of you.
I think I would have still received the warrior spirit and training from you,
Mother. But I would have also been tempered with Auntie Gabrielle&#146;s tenderness
and love of the written and spoken word. It would have been a charmed childhood,
and I&#146;m still angry that I was denied it. But I&#146;m also realistic and
know that the only place I have to go is forward and that&#146;s what I&#146;m
trying to do.&quot; She looked over at Gabrielle with the same look on her face
that the bard recently received from Xena, the look that help was needed to
for her to continue with the right words.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#146;re sorry, too,
Eve.&quot; Gabrielle assured the young woman. &quot;We had a plan to get you
out of harm&#146;s way. If Ares hadn&#146;t entombed us, we would have taken
you to a remote village where you would have grown, sheltered by our love. You&#146;re
absolutely correct, you would have been given the best of both our worlds, and
I honestly believe we love you equally. As Aphrodite told me you didn&#146;t
grow under my heart but you most assuredly would have grown in it. I have loved
you since before you were born, as much as I would have loved any child of my
own.&quot;</p>
<p>Eve shook her head and Gabrielle
could see the tears trickling down the face that had, in the near past, been
so full of rage and hatred. It now took on the aspect of that of a small child
who lost her way and was trying desperately to make it home, where she knew
she would be loved and cared for. &quot;I guess what I was trying to get at
is that I know everything you just said to me to be the truth and if I had been
allowed to grow up with you both as parents, I don&#146;t think I would be calling
you Auntie Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle looked away from her
lover&#146;s daughter, the only daughter she herself might ever know. Her fair
face blushed with the anticipation of the direction in which the conversation
was leading. &quot;Probably not, Eve,&quot; were the only words that strangled
from the bard&#146;s mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess what I&#146;m
asking is if it would be alright with you if I called you Mom? It seems as though
it would be a more fitting title.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#146;d be honored, Eve.&quot;
Gabrielle looked at Eve and then at Xena who was smiling as proudly as the day
she gave birth to the young woman who now rode behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;Guess you&#146;ll have
to start a new scroll Gabrielle, <u>Eve Has Two Mothers</u>.&quot; Xena chuckled
uncharacteristically. </p>
<p>&quot;It might be uncommon in
the known world, but in Amazon villages she would have just been one of the
kids.&quot; Gabrielle countered with a smile.</p>
<p>The sun was beginning to set
as the horses started down the path that led to the lake. There would be enough
light to set up camp and perhaps have some tea and the last of the nutbread.
Because they didn&#146;t have to travel by conventional means to the village
in the morning there was no need to fret over breakfast.</p>
<p>When the two more experienced
women were ready to go up to the ledge Xena started to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#146;ll come down .
. .&quot; Xena started.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#146;ll come down
. . .&quot; Gabrielle interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#146;ll come down to
get you in the morning, Eve.&quot; Xena finished with a large hand over her
bard&#146;s mouth and a smile on her face. She turned to her lover. &quot;The
morning swim will be invigorating.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can just as easily take
a shower.&quot; Gabrielle argued.</p>
<p>Ignoring the last statement,
Xena said good night to her daughter and motioned Gabrielle onto the platform.
Gabrielle said good night and did as she was bid, mumbling something about having
to jump off the ledge, as she stepped onto the golden square.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#146;ll send the loot
bags up next and then the horses, Argo first. They can graze in the forest up
there tonight, at least we know they won&#146;t stray.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, but wait until you
see me at the edge of the ledge before sending my horse up. Good night again,
Eve.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Good night, Mom,&quot;
the young woman smiled trying out the new name on the woman who had always thought
of herself as Eve&#146;s second mother. The younger woman watched as a smile
spread across Gabrielle&#146;s face. Xena pushed the button and Gabrielle was
gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn, that&#146;s handy.&quot;
Eve looked over at her mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes it is, isn&#146;t
it? You know, you made Gabrielle a very proud woman today, Eve.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I felt she deserved the
title after all she&#146;s been through for me. And I feel as close to her as
I do to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#146;m glad you feel
that way, she loves you very much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know Mother.&quot; Eve
had a hard time doing the sensitive chats just like her mother and decided to
turn away and get the horses.</p>
<p>For the second time that day
the horses made the unusual journey, ending up on the ledge high above the lake.
Xena said good night to her daughter and joined her lover in the cave.</p>
<p>&quot;I could get used to traveling
like this.&quot; Xena stated upon arriving up on the ledge.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and there was a
time when the ability was offered to you.&quot; Gabrielle countered as she walked
back into the cave from the forest.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#146;t go there, Gabrielle.
I have plans for the rest of this evening and your becoming agitated does not
fit into them.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle grabbed a couple towels
from the shelves. &quot;Want to start off with a shower?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#146;t think of
a better way.&quot; Xena watched as her bard slowly undressed, folding each
garment and carefully placing it on a shelf before turning and catching her
warrior in the act of staring.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, it&#146;s not like
it&#146;s anything you haven&#146;t seen before,&quot; the small blonde chided.</p>
<p>&quot;No, but it is definitely
something I could spend eternity gazing at. Come here you.&quot; She walked
over and began to embrace the woman of her dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;No you don&#146;t, warrior
&#150; those things . . .&quot; she pointed to the breastplate armor. &quot;
. . . are dangerous. I suggest you strip before trying that maneuver again,
I don&#146;t do pain very well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#146;t know
about that . . . I&#146;ve seen you do pain . . . you&#146;re almost an expert
at it.&quot; The raven-haired beauty grinned as she began to undress.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me restate then .
. . I don&#146;t like doing pain. Is that better?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Much.&quot; Xena laughed.
&quot;Want me to light these candles before we bathe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please, I&#146;ll go get
some soap out of the saddlebags.&quot; </p>
<p>While she was getting the soap,
Gabrielle remembered a bottled of scented oil they had purchased at the last
town they went through; she grabbed that, also, and placed in on the stand beside
the bed. Xena was still lighting candles, so Gabrielle walked over to the edge
of the outcropping and looked down to see if she could spot Eve. She was feeling
a little guilty about leaving the younger woman down at the campsite alone.
When she had voiced the dilemma earlier, Eve laughed at her and commented that
if she could keep a few of Gabrielle&#146;s scrolls to read, she would have
plenty to keep her occupied before going to sleep. Of course, the bard was delighted
that the younger woman was interested in the writings and told her to help herself.
It had been an arduous day, and they were all tired, but a little relaxation
before sleep would make dreaming that much sweeter.</p>
<p>When Gabrielle glanced down
at the campsite, she saw Eve sitting by the fire with a cup of tea beside her
and a partially unraveled scroll between her hands. Gabrielle smiled as she
watched Eve read; the bard was happy someone was enjoying the elaboration of
deeds she took such pleasure in substantiating for posterity. </p>
<p>The warmth of a tall muscular
body pressing close to hers turned her attention away from their daughter, and
she found herself leaning back for a closer touch. Xena&#146;s soft contralto
voice added to the growing atmosphere. &quot;Everything as it should be down
there?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Looks to be.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Ready for some water sports?&quot;
</p>
<p>Gabrielle was gently turned
to face the love of her life. Their bodies were already responding to one another,
sending out silent messages of desire. Taking her warrior&#146;s hand in her
own they walked over to the area of the grotto where the water dipped inward,
splashing lavishly on the ground before gently swirling and joining the fluid
at the bottom of the falls.</p>
<p>&quot;Look Xena.&quot; Gabrielle
pointed to the inside of the falls. &quot;I hadn&#146;t noticed that last night.
Guess I was otherwise occupied,&quot; she grinned sheepishly. </p>
<p>Xena&#146;s eyes followed the
direction of her lover&#146;s pointing finger, first glimpsing one of the few
areas of the grotto where the dark blanket of night could be seen through the
gushing water, then she saw what Gabrielle was talking about. In the middle
of the falls the effect became that of an aurora borealis with the moonlight
shining in prisms through the cascading water giving the illusion of multi-colored
stars tumbling against a background of rainbow mist. </p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#146;t it breathtaking?&quot;
Gabrielle asked.</p>
<p>The dark warrior again glanced
at the display and then down at the shoulders of her lover, allowing her fingers
to tenderly touch the soft skin of her fair maid. She bent down and placed a
moist kiss behind Gabrielle&#146;s ear. &quot;Absolutely breathtaking.&quot;</p>
<p>The bard turned slowly and took
her champion&#146;s face in her hands. Pulling the taller woman down to receive
a kiss she whispered, &quot;You are, too.&quot;</p>
<p>With total lack of effort Xena
grabbed Gabrielle up into her arms and stepped fully into the falls with her
heart&#146;s desire in her arms. </p>
<p>&quot;Put me down and I&#146;ll
lather you.&quot; Gabrielle promised. </p>
<p>The ritual of lathering and
rinsing, lathering and rinsing continued until the game became more and more
intense. Soon the soap was lost to rocks, as hands trailed up and down bodies,
flowing like the water as it surged over, around and between their bodies. They
dance in the cool liquid like nymphs around a sacred fountain taking in the
beauty of everything around them, including each other.</p>
<p>Grabbing Gabrielle&#146;s hand
Xena drew her from the clutches of the falls back into the flickering candlelit
room. The ceremony of drying also became a lesson in temperance as they touched
and released one another, teasing erotic areas with the soft, billowy towels
and enhancing the torment with fingers peeking playfully through the material
to touch the skin beneath. </p>
<p>Dried of any traces of water,
but moist with the fluids of love the two lay on the bed, holding one another
and whispering vows of love that stretched from their new beginning in the here
and now to the lives they had yet to live.</p>
<p>The fair-haired beauty reached
over and opened the bottle of scented oil, a sweet musk that smelled even sweeter
when applied to the body of her warrior.</p>
<p>&quot;Relax Xena.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Re what?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Relax my love.&quot; Warming
the oil in the palms of her hands she straddled the waist of her champion. Beginning
at the broad, muscular shoulders the small hands of the bard wove their magic
as she sensuously massaged the area. Feather like touches lingered on the firm
breasts as nipples stood erect &#150; their desire for attention obvious. Not
being one to neglect even the obscure, the bard leaned into her warrior&#146;s
body, sliding her own smaller frame down Xena&#146;s legs and positioning herself
between the sinewy thighs. </p>
<p>Moans of delight ushered forth
from the warrior&#146;s throat. Gabrielle&#146;s mouth found the waiting nipples,
and an adventurous tongue played hide-and-seek as it flicked between the impatiently
awaiting breasts. </p>
<p>The small figure began to once
again journey further southward when suddenly two strong hands were placed,
one under each of her armpits. She was hurled upward, over to the right and
down again onto her back.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#146;t take it any
longer.&quot; The inflection was even deeper than usual. &quot;I need you Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Xena,&quot; was the only
word that escaped the confused bard&#146;s lips.</p>
<p>&quot; Now . . . I want you,
now. You don&#146;t realize what you&#146;re doing to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Xena,&quot; lack of
understanding was apparent. </p>
<p>Lying beside and partially on
top of her bard, the hero whispered. &quot;I want you so badly, it&#146;s as
though . . .&quot; without finishing the sentence the dark warrior grabbed her
lover&#146;s hand and placed it between her own nether folds. &quot;Feel that?
The heat is so intense.&quot; She pushed the fingers of the small hand to where
they entered her center; the warrior would not let loose of the hand and pushed
harder to keep it in the same position. It was only then that her bard understood.</p>
<p>&quot;By the Gods Xena you&#146;re
pulsating as though you&#146;ve already . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did Gabrielle! The water,
the oil the touch of your tongue . . . my mind and body wouldn&#146;t allow
me to wait. The intensity was unbelievable. I love you more than life Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you, too, Xena.&quot;</p>
<p>With that the raven-haired beauty
began to deliciously torture her bard with tantalizing kisses, and caresses.
She began re-exploring every crevice and curve on the small body beneath her.
The warrior continued until Gabrielle was physically exhausted. Cries of passion
sang through the cavern, dancing on the walls and bouncing off the candles,
as they flickered with a rhythm that matched the mood of the lovers. When the
small blonde reached her final climax her lover joined her simultaneously, then
collapsed next to her, still entwined in the body that was half beneath her,
half beside her, and having no desire to move.</p>
<p>Xena breathed softly into the
ear that was at mouth level. &quot;Are you totally satisfied or would you like
another round.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#146;ve got to be
kidding me, Xena. I don&#146;t think I could respond again if I tried.&quot;</p>
<p>Long fingers trailed down the
bard&#146;s leg, coming to rest on the swollen bud hidden within the soft lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Xena . . . off! <i>She&#146;s
</i>had enough.&quot; Gabrielle giggled.</p>
<p>The fair-haired beauty lifted
her warrior&#146;s hand and placed it to her lips, showing each finger special
attention as she put them, one by one, into her mouth and softly sucked, tasting
the sweetness her lover had experienced all night. &quot;The things you do to
me, my hero. No one has ever made me feel the way you do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And no one else had better
even attempt to . . . not as long as I&#146;m alive.&quot; Lightening the conversation
she added, &quot;Guess I&#146;m not too bad for the mother of a 25-year-old
daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you are very, very
bad my warrior . . . but bad in the very best sense of the word! So . . . that&#146;s
the way a Mother makes love, is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#146;s the way this
Mother does.&quot; Xena smiled holding in a laugh, then changing the subject
again. &quot;By the way, how do you feel about Eve&#146;s calling you Mom?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Terrific, but I think
you already knew the answer to that one, Xena.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; She snuggled
up closer to her soulmate and kissed her gently on the cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;But you know,&quot; Gabrielle
continued, &quot;I&#146;ve been thinking . . . &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my, that could cause
problems. &quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle tickled the dark beauty
and then told her to stop being sarcastic and listen. &quot;With the situation
that has arisen in our little family, we give the statement <i>&#145;growing
up with your children&#146;</i> a whole different prospective.&quot; She laughed
and cuddled closer to her lover. </p>
<p>The candles had extinguished
themselves and the cavern was now pitch black, save for the slivers of moonlight
drifting in through the shimmering falls. Gabrielle looked over at the water
and at the reflection of an almost full moon. Already Xena&#146;s breathing
had turned heavy and steady. The bard smiled at the turn their relationship
was taking. She was glad they had allowed themselves this extra day before traveling
on to the village. Her last waking thoughts before drifting off to sleep were
those of spending the rest of eternity with the soul sleeping peacefully beside
her.</p>
<p><i>I&#146;m getting married to
the warrior of my dreams! By this time, one-or-two moons from now, I&#146;ll
be taking vows in front of my entire tribe, vows to commit myself to love and
stand by Xena for the rest of my life. Little do they know that I have loved
her before, and that I shall continue to love her until the end of time.</i></p>
