<p><b>Authors Note: This is my new story, Jambajuice helped me with the idea so credit goes to her... (round of applause).. anyway basically the story is the part in the movie where Olivia tells Sebastian/Viola to come met her at the kissing booth, this is my take and progression from what would happen if Viola did go... please tell me what you think.. this is a dedication to Jambajuice for inspiration. </b></p>

<p>Duke, Sebastian who was in fact Viola in disguise and the other boys entered the fair, gazing around at the shinning booths, and merry children, they all smiled. Viola had been Sebastian for about a week now and had made some new friends in Duke, Toby and Andrew.</p>
<p>As the boys stood at the entrance deciding on what they were going to do, Olivia walked past. Olivia and Sebastian had been named lab partners and unbeknown to Sebastian who was really Viola, Olivia had a thing for Sebastian.</p>
<p>"I'll be at the kissing booth, promise to come see me", said Olivia as she walked past, winking suggestively towards Viola.</p>
<p>Olivia continued to walk as Duke watched in horror, she turned around and waved at Sebastian before continuing onto the kissing booth. Once Olivia was out of sight Duke pulled Sebastian aside, out of ear shoot of the other guys.</p>
<p>"Sebastian my main man", said Duke clapping Sebastian on the back.</p>
<p>"Ah yeah buddy", said Viola, trying her best manly voice, so as not to give away her actual gender.</p>
<p>"Right, we are buddies, and buddies help each other out, right?", asked Duke.</p>
<p>Viola nodded, not really understanding where this was going.</p>
<p>"So as my buddy your gonna come with me to the kissing booth", said Duke pulling Sebastian a little way, till Viola dug her heels in and refused to budge.</p>
<p>"Wait, why?", asked Viola, standing her ground. Duke turned back, sighing.</p>
<p>"Because, didn't you see that wave and the winking thing, Olivia totally has the hots for you", said Duke, trying to pull Sebastian again.</p>
<p>"But I thought you liked her", said Viola, puzzled.</p>
<p>"I do and this is how I'm going to get her", said Duke again pulling Sebastian a little way before he stopped.</p>
<p>"This way it won't be weird", said Duke pleading with Sebastian.</p>
<p>"Just trust me okay", said Duke and before Sebastian could argue, Duke had dragged Sebastian all the way to the line.</p>
<p>They were lined up in no time, and not surprisingly there was a huge line of boys ranging from 11 to 80, Viola shuddered as she spotted the elderly man behind them. Everyone seemed desperate to get some kissing action with the blond. As Viola looked up to the stage were Olivia sat in a lip lock with a complete stranger, Viola could understand why all these guys had lined up. For them it was about her good looks, her slim figure and her blond hair, as Viola thought more about it. It became obvious to Viola that no one really cared about Olivia's mind or her personality, to them she was a free kiss, well a $2 kiss anyway.</p>
<p>As Viola was looking at Olivia, the kiss ended and Olivia once again searched the crowd for Sebastian, spotting Sebastian a little way down the line she smiled and waved. Viola waved back not wanting to be rude, that what she told herself anyway.</p>
<p>Once they reached the front of the line, Duke knocked Viola forward.</p>
<p>"Sebastian!", said Olivia, hoping out of her chair, she was acting like she hadn't seen Sebastian all day.</p>
<p>"Hey Olivia", said Viola nervously, she pushed the nerves down and moved forward.</p>
<p>"Ticket?", asked Olivia, holding out her hand for the ticket.</p>
<p>Viola blushed, the nerves were getting to her and as she searched her pockets she realized she didn't have her ticket, the perfect excuse to end a potentially harmful situation.</p>
<p>"Oh sorry Olivia looks like I don't have a ticket", said Viola, turning to move off the stage.</p>
<p>"Thats alright this ones on me", said Olivia, grabbing Viola's hand, which caused her to turn around.</p>
<p>Olivia snaked her arms around Viola's neck and brought her into the sweetest kiss Viola had ever had. Justin didn't kiss this well, and Viola doubted that any more than 10 people on the planet could. Olivia upon feeling Viola relax, moved one hand into the wig, which she believed to be hair, and the other remained on her neck holding their lips together. Viola moved her hands that had been doing nothing, to hold Olivia at the small of her back, drawing her closer. As Olivia opened her mouth, a little wider the kiss deepened.</p>
<p>Duke stood watching in amazement, that two people could kiss for so long without air. It had yet to dawn on him that Sebastian was kissing his crush, and had yet to stop.</p>
<p>Olivia couldn't believe how soft Sebastian's lips were, and Viola was completely lost in the feel of Olivia pressed up against her, lips locked.</p>
<p>Most of the boys in the line grumbled, as the couple continued to kiss, they doubted this dude would get away without a phone number, but one such on locker took a stand.</p>
<p>"Sebastian!", yelled Monique coming through the crowd.</p>
<p>Viola didn't respond to her name as it wasn't actually hers, she was enjoying the kiss to much too even notice as Monique made her way towards the stage. Olivia however did notice Monique's presence, enough to open her eyes and see Monique, just before she ripped the couple apart.</p>
