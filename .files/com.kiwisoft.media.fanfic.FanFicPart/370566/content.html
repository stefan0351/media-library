<p style="text-align:center;"><B>2</B></P><P>At the first sound of the bugle playing reveille, Miley Stewart jumped up and smashed her head on the upper bunk. Lilly Truscott, also shocked awake, came tumbling down and hit the floor with a resounding thud. The other girls, completely unperturbed, began to rouse themselves slowly.</P><P>"What—" moaned Miley.</P><P>The door flew open and Trina bounded into the room, already dressed. "All right, you guys, rise and shine! It's a beautiful day here at Algonkian!"</P><P>"Algonkian, my ass," mumbled Miley. "This is Alcatraz." She reached into her duffle, produced a piece of chalk and drew a small line on the cabin wall beside her bed. "One," she counted miserably.</P><P>"One what?" asked Lilly, picking herself painfully up off the floor.</P><P>"One day gone," Miley explained. "Only twenty-seven more to go."</P><P>"Hey!" exclaimed Lilly. "It's only six o'clock!"</P><P>"Of course," said Trina. "Early to bed, early to rise."</P><P>"Yes, said Miley.  "Makes a man healthy, wealthy and dead. I'm gonna get a few more hours sleep."</P><P>"Stewart, you get out of that bed!" hollered Trina. "We've got breakfast, and then the camp director's going to speak to all of us. Get moving!"</P><P>"Alcatraz," Miley repeated, rummaging in her bag for some clothes.</P><P>The girls got dressed and Trina marched them over to the wash station, which was located at a point central to their group of cabins. Miley and Lilly found themselves side by side at the sinks brushing their teeth.  Awkwardly, they eyed each other.</P><P>"Truce?" Lilly suggested shyly.</P><P>Miley shrugged.</P><P>"I'm sorry about the music," ventured Lilly.</P><P>"I've heard worse," admitted Miley generously.</P><P>Lilly was surprised.  As far as she knew, this was the first civil word Miley had spoken to anyone. Lilly returned to the business of brushing her teeth, but kept a curious eye on her peculiar bunkmate.</P><P>"<I>Breakfast!</I>" bellowed Trina. From the wash station she led Cabin 13 to the mess hall.</P><P>As they stood in line with their trays, Lilly and Miley, still side by side, continued to eye each other curiously.</P><P>"I don't suppose they can really ruin breakfast," suggested Lilly hopefully.</P><P>"I have faith," said Miley quietly.</P><P>The two girls chose their breakfast and sat down at table 13.</P><P>"Well, Stewart," Trina greeted her, "you'd better eat a hearty breakfast because today we're going to have relay races."</P><P>"Are you?" said Miley mildly. She assumed a longsuffering look. "It's a shame I'll have to miss that."</P><P>"Why?" asked the counselor.</P><P>"I don't run," Miley explained.</P><P>"She doesn't do anything!" exclaimed Ashley.</P><P>"Exactly," Miley agreed.</P><P>"How do you do that?" Lilly whispered. "How do you get out of doing all those crummy camp things?"</P><P>"It's very simple.  You just don't go."</P><P>Lilly looked at her with something like admiration in her eyes.</P><P>"Eat up, everybody," called Trina, "because we have the assembly with the camp director in ten minutes. When you've returned your tray, go out to the ball field."</P><P>"Stewart wont' be coming," announced Ashley sarcastically. "All she does is listen to her iPod."</P><P>Miley stood up, picked up her tray and started towards the tray-return conveyor belt. As she passed the end of the table, she carefully tilted the tray, sending the remains of her breakfast—corn flakes and milk, scrambled eggs and orange juice—sliding off into Ashley's lap.</P><P>"Oops," she said mildly.</P><P>A high-pitched giggle escaped Lilly Truscott.</P><P>"Stewart," stormed Trina, "you did that on purpose!"</P><P>"It does look that way," Miley admitted.</P><P>"That'll cost you two days work detail!" exclaimed Trina.</P><P>"Darn it," said Miley, "I thought I was going to get solitary confinement."</P><P>"And clean that up!" Trina ranted. "Ashley, go and change. Hurry up, you guys. We can't keep the camp director waiting."</P><P>The entire population of Camp Algonkian Island was assembled on the baseball diamond in front of a hastily erected podium. Marina, the head counselor, dressed in shorts and T-shirt exactly like Trina and her counterparts, walked up to the microphone and addressed the group.</P><P>"Hi, gang! Are we having a great time?"</P><P>"Do we want an honest answer?" muttered Miley.</P><P>Lilly snickered.</P><P>Both were drowned out by the loud cheering from almost three hundred throats.</P><P>"I know you're all anxious to get into the fun," the head counselor went on, "but first, let's give a nice warm Algonkian welcome to our camp director, Ms. Warden!"</P><P>"How appropriate," murmured Miley, nodding wisely. "A Warden for Alcatraz."</P><P>Lilly laughed out loud.</P><P>"Shhh!" said Trina warningly. "Truscott, behave yourself!"</P><P>As the applause died down, Ms. Warden, a short, way-too-tan, middle-aged woman with skinny bow legs sticking out of Bermuda shorts, stepped up to the microphone.</P><P>"Good morning, girls," she greeted the assembly. "It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Algonkian."</P><P>"It would give me great pleasure to go home," mumbled Miley.</P><P>Lilly snorted loudly into the silence.</P><P>"Truscott!"</P><P>"This is Camp Algonkian Island," Ms. Warden continued. "It was founded thirty-one years ago by my grandfather, Elias Warden. I like to think of Algonkian as the finest camp in California. We have facilities for every activity you can think of. Camp is a great experience for a young lady. Aside from the obvious advantage of enjoyment, a camper grows up with clear eyes, strong back and straight limbs."</P><P>"Obviously," murmered Miley, "<I>you</I> didn't get to go to camp."</P><P>Lilly looked at Ms. Warden's skinny bow legs, and the whole thing proved too much for her. It began in her throat, progressed to a series of muffled giggles, and rose to a mighty crescendo.</P><P>"Truscott!" exclaimed a horrified Trina. "What's wrong with you?"</P><P>By now everyone except Ms. Warden was devoting full attention to Lilly's display. The director was still rambling on about the benefits of camp.</P><P>"Truscott, stop it!"</P><P>But there was no stopping it. Lilly was doubled over in agony, vainly trying to suppress her wild laughter. Her merriment was infectious. One by one, other girls began to laugh. Soon the whole island was rocking with hysteria.</P><P>"Truscott!" shouted Trina over the din. "You caused all this! Two days work detail for you!"</P><P>Meanwhile, Ms. Warden was delighted with the wonderful reception the girls were giving her.  This was going to be the best summer yet. What an ovation!</P><P>Trina held her head.  Between Truscott and Stewart, she was going to have her hands full for the next four weeks.</P><P>Pushing a large red wheelbarrow loaded to overflowing with green garbage bags, Lilly started up the wooded path to the dump. She sighed heavily. Work detail. Her first full day at camp and already she was in the garbage. What a fun place.</P><P>A few girls gathering wood for the evening bonfire grinned sympathetically as she struggled past. The front wheel struck the exposed root of an old tree and one of the bags rolled out of the barrow and broke open. Chicken bones were everywhere. Lilly looked hopelessly at the evening sky as if for a sign. None came. Oh well, at least now she knew why they had equipped her with a shovel. After scooping up the mess, she continued down the path. She could see the dump now—and smell it too. She wrinkled her nose as she trudged up to the mound, then stopped short. There, flat on her back in her wheelbarrow, lay Miley Stewart. Her iPod was in her hand, the buds were in her ears, and her eyes were closed. Her normally expressionless face wore a blissful look.</P><P>Lilly was startled by Miley's beauty, and even more startled that she was affected by it.  A nervous fluttering in her stomach intensified when Miley licked her lips, eyes still shut. Self-consciously, Lilly silently dumped her cargo. After all, what could she say or do? Miley had given every indication that her only desire was to be left alone. Lilly couldn't very well declare herself a friend. But wouldn't it be great! Miley was the only person who hated camp as much as she did!</P><P>"Hi," she ventured finally.</P><P>Miley gave no indication of having heard her.</P><P>Lilly shrugged. Oh well, if she doesn't want anything to do with me, then the feeling is mutual, she thought. She started to pilot her wheelbarrow back in the direction of the camp.</P><P>"Hey," said a voice from behind her, "I suppose you're blamin' me for getting you put on the garbage squad."</P><P>Lilly wheeled to face Miley, who had pocketed her mp3 player and was sitting up. "Of course not—yes! Yes, I <I>am</I> blaming you. You made me laugh!"</P><P>"I was talkin' to myself," Miley protested. "You were eavesdroppin'."</P><P>"Whatever," said Lilly wearily, just to avoid an argument.</P><P>Miley climbed out of her wheelbarrow and sat down on a rock. Lilly sat on the ground facing her.</P><P>"Camp!" Miley said with malice in her voice. "Alcatraz, a Warden, clones—and now garbage!"</P><P>"I'm here as a reward," said Lilly unhappily. "Good grades in school."</P><P>Miley nodded understandingly. "I'm here on a guidance rap. The school guidance department misguided my daddy into guidin' me here. They're going to make a well-adjusted, social animal out of me. They think."</P><P>"Where are you from?" asked Lilly. "You've got a southern accent."</P><P>Miley sighed.  "Tennessee," she said. "And was aware of the fact that I have a southern accent, but thanks for lettin' me know, anyway."</P><P>"Why'd you come to California?" Lilly asked, ignoring the sarcasm.</P><P>"Long story."</P><P>"You don't like it here very much, do you?"</P><P>"It shows, doesn't it?"</P><P>Lilly had to laugh.  "Well, in case you hadn't noticed, I'm not too thrilled with camp either."</P><P>"I noticed," confirmed Miley.</P><P>"It's getting pretty dark," observed Lilly. "I guess we'd better be getting back."</P><P>"Why? So we can sit around their stupid campfire and howl at the moon? I'd like to set fire to the whole place, startin' with the Warden's house. <I>That</I> would be a fire I could sing around!"</P><P>Lilly looked at her uncertainly. "But you wouldn't do anything like that, would you?"</P><P>"Oh, no, of course not. It was just a pleasant thought."</P><P>Both girls lapsed into silence, listening to the gurgling of the nearby creek.</P><P>Miley ran her fingers through her hair thoughtfully. "You know," she began slowly, "if a natural disaster occurred, makin' the camp unlivable, they'd have to send us home."</P><P>Lilly nodded her agreement. "It's a shame we don't have many natural disasters around here."</P><P>"But what if it was a man-made natural disaster?" Miley insisted. "What if, for instance, that creek was dammed up and re-routed towards the cabins? Nobody'd get hurt, but we'd be up to our ears in mud. The cabin floors'd be wet and the insects would be really terrible. They'd definitely have to send us home."</P><P>"It sounds great," said Lilly mournfully, "but we could never do it."</P><P>"Speak for yourself," said Miley. "I'm startin' tomorrow." The sound of singing voices swelled on the evening breeze. "Okay, let's go back now. But first, do you want to help me pick out a few choice bits of garbage?"</P><P>"What for?"</P><P>"Ashley's shoes," Miley explained. "I've noticed there's usually nothing in them but feet."</P><P>Lilly laughed appreciatively. "Sure." She picked up an orange peel. "How about this?"</P><P>"Admirable," replied Miley. "You're not bad, you know. You'll do."</P><P>Lilly laughed again.  "Now that I'll do, maybe you'll tell me your name. All I know is <I>'Stewart!'</I>" She did a creditable imitation of Trina's angry cry.</P><P>"That's me. Miley Stewart."</P><P>"Hi. I'm Lilly Truscott."</P><P>The two let down the handles of their wheelbarrows and shook hands solemnly. Then, side by side, they moved off in the direction of the campsite.</P><P>Near the deserted dump, the creek gurgled on.</P>
